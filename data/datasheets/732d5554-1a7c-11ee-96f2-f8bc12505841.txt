MIC61150\n \n \nNovember 2010 12 M9999-112210-A \n Functional Description \nThe MIC61150 is an ultra-hi gh-performance, low-dropout \nlinear regulator designed for high-current applications \nthat require low input voltage operation. The MIC61150 \noperates from a single input  supply and generates an \ninternal supply that is higher than the input voltage to \ndrive an on-chip N-Channel MOSFET. The N-Channel \nMOSFET significantly reduces the dropout voltage when compared to a traditional P-Channel MOSFET. \nP-Channel MOSFETs are usually used in single-supply \nlow-dropout linear voltage regulators. However, for input voltages below 1.5V, there is not sufficient gate drive to \nturn on the P-Channel. To solve this issue, the MIC61150 uses a simple internal charge pump to drive the internal N-Channel MOSFET’s gate higher than the \ninput voltage, see Functional Diagram. The N-Channel \nMOSFET greatly reduces the dropout voltage for the same die area when compared to that of a P-Channel. \nOther added benefits of the charge pump include the \nability to control the output voltage rise time and to \nimprove the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). This is \naccomplished by using the V\nCP supply to power the error \namplifier. \nThe other significant advantage of the MIC61150 over a \nP-Channel regulator is its transient response. The N-\nChannel in the follower configuration is much faster than its P-channel counter part and is simpler to compensate. \nAny type of output capacitor can be placed in parallel \nwith it as long as the minimum value output ceramic \ncapacitor is placed next to the MIC61150. See the \nOutput Capacitor  section for specific details. Also, the \nregulator is fully protected from damage due to fault \nconditions by offering linea r current limiting and thermal \nshutdown. \nSoft-Start \nSoft-start reduces the power supply input surge current \nat startup by cont rolling the output voltage rise time. The \ninput surge appears while the output capacitor is \ncharged up. A slower output rise time will draw a lower \ninput surge current.   \nThe CP pin is the output of the internal charge pump. \nThe soft-start rise time is controlled by the external \ncapacitor connected from CP pin to GND. During soft-\nstart, the charge pump feeds a current to C\nCP. The \noutput voltage rise time is dependent upon the value of C\nCP, the input voltage, output voltage and the current \nlimit. The value of the charge pump external capacitor \nselected is recommended in the range of 0.1µF to 1µF, \nalthough larger value capacitors can be used for a longer turn-on time. Input Capacitor \nA 10µF ceramic input capacitor is all that is required for \nmost applications. However, fast load transient and low \nheadroom (V\nIN – V OUT) requires additional bulk bypass \ncapacitance to ensure that the regulator does not drop \nout of regulation.   \nThe input capacitor must be placed on the same side of \nthe board and next to the MIC61150 to minimize the dropout voltage and voltage ringing during transient and \nshort circuit conditions. It is also recommended to use \ntwo vias for each end of the capacitor to connect to the power and ground plane. \nX7R or X5R dielectric ceramic capacitors are \nrecommended because of their temperature \nperformance. X7R-type capacitors change capacitance \nby 15% over their operat ing temperature range and are \nthe most stable type of ceramic capacitors. Z5U and \nY5V dielectric capacitors change value by as much as \n50% and 60% respectively over their operating \ntemperature ranges. To use a ceramic chip capacitor with Y5V dielectric, the value must be much higher than \nan X7R ceramic or a tantalum capacitor to ensure the \nsame capacitance value over the operating temperature range. Tantalum capacitors have a very stable dielectric \n(10% over their operating temperature range) and can \nalso be used in parallel with the ceramic capacitor(s). See Typical Characteristics section for examples of load \ntransient response. \nOutput Capacitor \nAs part of the frequency compensation, the MIC61150 \nrequires a 22µF ceramic output capacitor. However, any \nother type of capacitor can be placed in parallel as long as the 22µF ceramic output capacitor is placed next to \nthe MIC61150.  \nOutput voltages below 0.8V require either a 47µF or  \n2x 22µF output capacitance fo r large output transients. \nThe increased output capacitance reduces the output voltage drop caused by load transients, which increases as a percentage of the output voltage as the output \nvoltage is lowered. \nThe output capacitor type and placement criteria are the \nsame as the input capacitor. See the Input Capacitor  \nsection for a detailed description. \nMinimum Load Current \nThe MIC61150 requires a minimum load of 10mA to \nmaintain output voltage regulation.  \nMicrel, Inc. MIC61150\n \n \nNovember 2010 13 M9999-112210-A Adjustable Regulator Design \nThe MIC61150 adjustable version allows programming \nthe output voltage from 0.5V to 3.0V by placing a resistor \ndivider network (R1, R2) from V OUT to GND (see \nApplication Circuit). The high side of R1 should be connected at the point-of-load for high-accuracy Kelvin \nsensing. V\nOUT is determined by the following equation:  \n \n⎟\n⎠⎞⎜\n⎝⎛+ × =1R2R10.5 VOUT  Eq. 1 \n \nwhere V OUT is the desired output voltage. \nThe resistor (R2) value between the FB pin and GND is \nselected to maintain a minimum 10mA load on the \noutput.  \nThe resistor values are calc ulated from the previous \nequation, resulting in the following:  \n⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛− × =10.5VR2 R1OUT Eq. 2 \n \nTable 1 is a list of resistor combinations to set the output \nvoltage.

To help reduce the thermal resistance, \nthe ePad (underneath the IC) should be soldered to the PCB ground and the placement of thermal vias either \nunderneath or near the ePad is highly recommended. \nThermal design requires the following application-speci ﬁc parameters: \n• Maximum ambient temperature (T\nA) \n• Output current (I OUT) \n• Output voltage (V OUT) \n• Input voltage (V IN) \n• Ground current (I GND) \nFirst, calculate the power dissipation of the regulator from these numbers and the device parameters from this \ndatasheet: \n \nP\nD = (V IN - V OUT) × I OUT + (V IN × I GND) Eq. 3 \n where the ground current is approximated by using \nnumbers from the Electrical Characteristics  or Typical \nCharacteristics  sections \nFor example, given an expected maximum ambient \ntemperature (T\nA) of 75°C with V IN = 1.2V, V OUT = 0.9V, \nand I OUT = 1.5A, first calculate the expected P D using \nEquation 1: \n \nPD = (1.2V – 0.9V) × 1.5A  + 1.2V × 0.015A  \n                  = 0.468W Eq. 4 \n Next, determnine the junction temperature for the \nexpected power dissipation above using the thermal \nresistance (θ\nJA) of the 10-pin 3mm × 3mm MLF® (YML) \nadhering to the following criteria for the PCB design: \n   \n1oz. copper and 100mm2 copper area for the \nMIC61150. T\nJ = (θJA × P D) + T A  \n    = (60.7 °C/W × 0.468W) + 75 °C  \n    = 103.4 °C Eq. 5 \n \nMicrel, Inc. MIC61150\n \n \nNovember 2010 14 M9999-112210-A \n To determine the maximum power dissipation allowed \nthat would not exceed the IC’s maximum junction \ntemperature (125 °C) when operating at a maximum \nambient temperature of 75 °C by: \n \nPD(MAX)  = (T J(MAX)  – T A) / θJA   \n            = (125 °C − 75°C) / (60.7 °C/W)  \n            = 0.824W Eq. 6 \nThermal Measurements \nIt is always wise to measure the IC’s case temperature \nto make sure that it is with in its operating limits. Although \nthis might seem like a very elementary task, it is very easy to get erroneous results. The most common \nmistake is to use the standard thermal couple that \ncomes with the thermal voltage meter. This thermal \ncouple wire gauge is large, typically 22 gauge, and \nbehaves like a heatsink, resulting in a lower case \nmeasurement. \nThere are two suggested methods for measuring the IC \ncase temperature: a thermal couple or an infrared \nthermometer. If a thermal couple is used, it must be \nconstructed of 36 gauge wire or higher to minimize the wire heatsinking effect. In addition, the thermal couple tip \nmust be covered in either thermal grease or thermal glue \nto make sure that the thermal couple junction is making good contact to the case of the IC. This thermal couple \nfrom Omega (5SC-TT-K-36-36) is adequate for most \napplications.  To avoid this messy thermal couple grease or glue, an infrared thermometer is recommended. Most infrared thermometers’ spot size are too large for an accurate \nreading on small form factor ICs. However, an IR \nthermometer from Optris has a 1mm spot size, which \nmakes it ideal for the 3mm × 3mm MLF\n® package. Also, \nget the optional stand. The stand makes it easy to hold \nthe beam on the IC for long periods of time. \nEnable \nThe MIC61150 features an active high enable input (EN) \nthat allows ON/OFF control of the regulator. The current \nthrough the device reduces to near “zero” when the \ndevice is shutdown, with only microamperes of leakage \ncurrent. The EN input may be directly tied to V IN or \ndriven by a voltage that is higher than V IN as long as the \nvoltage does not exceed the maximum operating rating \nof the EN pin. \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nMicrel, Inc.
