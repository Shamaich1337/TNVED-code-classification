The ADM3053 complies with the ISO 11898 standard.  \nThe device employs Analog Devices, Inc., iCoupler® technology \nto combine a 2-channel isolator, a CAN transceiver, and Analog \nDevices isoPower® dc-to-dc converter into a single SOIC surface \nmount package. An on-chip oscillator outputs a pair of square \nwaveforms that drive an internal transformer to provide isolated \npower. The device is powered by a single 5 V supply realizing a \nfully isolated CAN solution.  \nThe ADM3053 creates a fully isolated interface between the \nCAN protocol controller and the physical layer bus. It is capable \nof running at data rates of up to 1 Mbps.  \nThe device has current limiting and thermal shutdown features \nto protect against output short circuits. The part is fully specified \nover the industrial temperature range and is available in a  \n20-lead, wide-body SOIC package. \nThe ADM3053 contains iso Power technology that uses high \nfrequency switching elements to transfer power through the \ntransformer. Special care must be taken during printed circuit \nboard (PCB) layout to meet emissions standards. Refer to the AN-0971 Application Note , Recommendations for  Control of \nRadiated Emissions with isoPower Devices,  for details on board \nlayout considerations.  \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM \nADM3053\nTxDVCC\nRxD\nISOLATION\nBARRIER\nLOGIC SIDE BUS SIDEENCODE\nDECODEDECODE\nENCODEOSCILLATOR RECTIFIER\nREGULATOR\nDIGITAL ISOLATION iCouplerisoPower DC-TO-DC CONVERTER\nVIOVISOINVISOOU T\nRS\nCANH\nCANL\nVREFREFERENCE\nVOLTAGERECEIVER\nCAN TRANSCEIVERTxD\nRS\nRxD\nVREF\nGND2VCC\nSLOPE/\nSTANDBYDRIVERPROTECTION\n09293-001GND1 GND2\nPIN 11, PIN 13GND2\nPIN 16, PIN 20\n \nFigure 1. \n \nADM3053 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

Supply Current Measurement Test Circuit \n \nData Sheet ADM3053 \n \nRev. E | Page 13 of 18 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION  \nCAN TRANSCEIVER OPERATIO N \nA CAN bus has two states called dominant and recessive. A \ndominant state is present on the bus when the differential voltage \nbetween CANH and CANL is greater than 0.9  V . A recessive state  \nis present on the bus when the differential voltage between CANH  \nand CANL is less than 0.5  V.  During a dominant  bus state , the \nCANH pin is high, and the CANL pin is  low. During a recessive \nbus state, both the CANH and CANL pins are  in the high \nimpedance state.  \nPin 18 (R S) allows two diff erent modes of operation to be s elected : \nhigh -speed and s lope control. For high -speed operation, the \ntransmitter output transistors are simply switched on and off  as \nfast as possible. In this mode, no measures are taken to limit the \nrise and fall slopes. A  shielded cable is recommended t o avoid \nelectromagnetic interference ( EMI) problems. High -speed mode \nis selected by  connecting Pin 18 to ground.   \nSlope control mode allows the use of an unshielded twisted pair or a parallel pair of wires  as bus lines. To reduce EM I, the rise \nand fall slo pes must  be limited. The rise and fall  slopes can be \nprogrammed with a resistor connected from P in 18 to ground. \nThe slope is proportional to the current output at P in 18. \nSIGNAL ISOLATION  \nThe ADM 3053 signal isolation is implemented on  the logic side of \nthe interface. The part achieves signal isolation by having a digital  \nisolation section and a transceiver section (see  Figure 1). Data \napplied to the TxD pin referen ced to logic ground (GND1) are \ncoupled across an isolation barrier to appear at the transceiver  \nsection referenced to isolated ground (GND2). Similarly, the single -\nended  receiver output signal, referenced to isolated ground in \nthe transceiver section, is c oupled across the isolation barrier to \nappear at the R xD pin referenced to logic ground (GND1). The \nsignal isolation is powered by the V IO pin and allows the digital \ninterface to 3.3  V or 5  V logic. \nPOWER ISOLATION  \nThe ADM3053 power isolation is implemented using an isoPower \nintegrated isolated dc -to-dc converter. The dc-to-dc converter \nsection of the ADM 3053 works  on principles that are common to \nmost modern power supplies. It is a secondary side controller \narchitecture with isolated pulse -width modulation (PWM) \nfeedback . VCC power is supplied to an oscillating circuit that \nswitches current into a chip -scale air core transformer. Power \ntransferred to the secondary side is rectified and regulated  to 5 V.  \nThe secondary (V ISO) side controller regulat es the output by \ncreating a PWM control signal that is sent to the primary (V CC) \nside by a dedicated i Coupler data channel. The PWM modulates  \nthe oscillator circuit to control the power being sent to the \nsecondary side. Feedback allows for significantly higher power \nand efficiency.  \n The ADM3053 integrated dc -to-dc converter is designed as a \nself contained solution and must not  drive an external load . To \nmeet additional isolated power needs, iso Power  isolated dc -to-\ndc converters are available in a variety of power or power plus \nstandard data channel options.  \nTRUTH TABLES  \nThe truth tables in this section use the abbreviations found in \nTable 9. \nTable 9.

The thermal sensing circuitry detects the \nincrease in die temperature under this condition and disables the  \ndriver outputs. This circuitry is designed to disable the driver \noutputs when a die temperature of  150°C is reached. As the  \ndevice cools, the drivers are reenabled  at a temperature of 1 40°C. \n \nADM3053 Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 14 of 18 DC CORRECTNESS AND M AGNETIC FIELD IMMUNI TY \nThe digital signals transmit across the isolation barrier using \niCoupler te chnology. This technique uses chip -scale transformer  \nwindings to coup le the digital signals magnetically from one \nside of the barrier to the other.  \nDigital inputs are encoded into waveforms that are capable of \nexciting the primary transformer winding. At the secondary winding, the induced waveforms are decoded into the binary \nvalue that was originally transmitted.  \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause \nnarrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the transformer.  \nThe decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absence of logic transitions at the input for more than 1 µs, periodic sets of refresh  \npulses indicative of the correct input state are sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives  no internal pulses \nof more than approximately 5 μs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case, the isolator output \nis forced to a default state by the watchdog timer circuit.  \nThis situation must  occur in the ADM3053  device s only during \npower -up and power -down operations. The limitation  on the \nADM3053 magnetic field immunity is set by the condition in \nwhich induced voltage in the transformer receiving coil is \nsufficiently large to either falsely set or reset the decoder. The \nfollowing analysis defines the conditions under which this  \ncan occur.  \nThe 3.3 V operating condition of the ADM 3053  is examined \nbecause it represents the most susceptible mode of operation. The \npulses at the transformer output have an amplitude of >1.0 V.  T h e  decoder has a sensing threshold of about 0.5 V , thus establishing  a \n0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be tolerated. The \nvoltage induced across the receiving coil is given by  \nV = (−dβ /dt)Σπr\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N   \nwhere:  \nβ is magnetic flux den sity (gauss).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADM3053 and \nan imposed requirement that the induced voltage be, at most, \n50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable \nmagnetic field is calculated as shown in Figure 26.

Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a voltage  \nof 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the sensing threshold and does not cause a fault y output transition. Similarly,  \nif such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse (and is of the \nworst -case polarity), it reduces the received pulse from >1.0 V to  \n0.75 V , which is still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of \nthe decoder.  \nThe preceding  magnetic flux density values correspond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances from the \nADM 3053 transformers. Figure 27 expresses these allowable \ncurrent  magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected \ndistances. As shown in Figure 27, the ADM 3053 is extremely \nimmune and can be affected only by extremely large cu rrents \noperated at high frequency very close to the component. For the 1 MHz example, a 0.5 kA current must be placed 5 mm away from \nthe ADM 3053 to affect component operation.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)1k\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n1k 10k 100M 100k 1M 10MDISTANCE = 5mmDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n09293-0 11\n \nFigure 27.

E | Page 15 of 18 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION  \nPCB LAYOUT \nThe ADM 3053 signal and power  isolated  CAN  transceiver contains \nan isoPower  integrated dc -to-dc converter, requiring no external \ninterface circuitry for the logic interfaces. Power supply bypassing \nis required at the input and output supply pins (see Figure 28). \nThe power supply section of the ADM 3053 uses a 180 MHz \noscillator frequency to pass power  efficiently through its chip -\nscale transformers. In addition, the normal operation of the \ndata section of the i Coupler introduces switching tra nsients on \nthe power supply pins.  \nBypass capacitors are required for several operating frequencies. \nNoise suppression requires a low inductance, high frequency \ncapacitor, whereas ripple suppression and proper regulation require a large value capacitor. Th ese capacitors are connected \nbetween GND1  and Pin 6  (V\nIO) for V IO. It is recommended that \na combination of 100  nF and 10  nF be placed as shown in Figure 28 \n(C6 and C4 ). It is recommended that a combination of two \ncapacitors , with values of 100 nF and 10 µF,  are placed between \nPin 8 (V CC) and Pin 9 (GND1) for V CC as shown in Figure 28 (C2 \nand C1).  The V ISOIN and V ISOOUT  capacitors are connected between  \nPin 11 (GND2) and Pin 12 (V ISOOUT ) with recommended values \nof 100 nF and 10  µF as shown in Figure 28 (C5 and C8). Two \ncapacitors are recommended to be fitted Pin  19 (V ISOIN) and Pin 20  \n(GND2)  with values of 100nF and 10nF as shown in Figure 28 \n(C9 and C7) . The best practice recommended is to use a very low  \ninductance ceramic capacitor, o r its equivalent, for the smaller \nvalue. The total lead length between both ends of the capacitor and the input power supply pin must  not exceed 10 mm.  \nThe ADM3053 features an internal split paddle, lead frame on the  \nbus side. For the best noise suppression, filter both the GND2  \npins (Pin 11 and Pin13) and V\nISOOUT  signals of the integrated dc -\nto-dc converter for high frequency currents. Use surface -mount \nferrite beads in series with the signals before routing back to the \ndevice. See Figure 28 for the recommend ed PCB layout.  \nThe impedance of the ferrite bead is chosen to be about 2 kΩ \nbetween the 100 MHz and 1 GHz frequency range, to reduce \nthe emissions at the 180 MHz primary switching frequency and \nthe 360 MHz secondary side rectifying frequency and \nharmonics . \n \n \n09293-028GND11\nNC2\nGND13\nRxD4GND2 20\nVISOIN19\nRS18\nCANH 17\nTxD5 GND2 16\nVIO6 CANL 15\nGND17 VREF14\nVCC8 GND2 13\nGND19 VISOOUT12\nGND1 10 GND2 11ADM3053\n0.01µF 0.1µF\n0.1µF 10µF0.1µF 0.01µF\n10µF 0.1µF FERRITES\n \nFigure 28. Recommended PCB Layout  \nIn applications involving high common -mode transients, ensure  \nthat board coupling across the isolation barrier is minimized. \nFurthermore, design the board layout such that any coupling \nthat does occur equally affects all pins on a given component side.  \nFailure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between  pins \nexceeding the absolute maximum ratings for the device, thereby \nleading to latch -up and/or permanent damage.  \nThe ADM 3053 dissipate s approximately 650 mW of power when \nfully loaded. Because it is not possible to apply a heat sink to an \nisolation device, the devices primarily depend on heat dissipation  \ninto the PCB through the GND pins. If the devices are used at  \nhigh ambient  temperatures, provide a thermal  path from  the GND \npins to the PCB ground plane. The board layout in Figure 28 shows \nenlarged pads for Pin 1, Pin 3,  Pin 9, Pin 10, Pin 11, Pin 14, Pin 16, \nand Pin 20. Implement multiple vias from the pad to the ground plane to reduce the temperature inside the chip significantly. The dimensions of the expanded pads are at the discretion of the \ndesigner and dependent on the available board space.  \nEMI CONSIDERATIONS   \nThe dc -to-dc converter section of the ADM 3053 must, of necessity, \noperate  at very high frequency to allow efficient power transfer \nthrough the small transformers. This creates high frequency \ncurrents that can propagate in circuit board ground and power planes, causing edge and dipole radiation. Grounded enclosures \nare recommend ed for applications that use these devices. If \ngrounded enclosures are not possible, good RF design practices \nmust  be followed in the layout of the PCB. See the AN-0971 \nApplication Note , Recomme ndations for  Control of Radiated \nEmissions with isoPower Devices , for more information.  \nADM3053 Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 16 of 18 RS PIN  \nFor high speed mode, the RS pin is connected directly to GND2 \n(Pin 16 or P in 20). The transition time of the CAN bus signals \nare short as possible , allowing higher speed signaling. A shielded \ncable is recommended to avoid EMI problems in high speed mode.  \nSlope control mode allows the use of unshielded twisted pair \nwires or parallel pair wires as bus lines. The signal rise and fall \ntransition times are  slowed to reduce EMI and ringing. The rise \nand fall slopes are adjusted with the  resistor (R SLOPE) connected \nfrom R S to GND2. See Figure 6 for details.  \nThe R S pin ca nnot be left floating.  \nINSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected to voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insulation  \ndegradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage \nwaveform app lied across the insulation. Analog Devices conducts  \nan extensive set of evaluations to determine the lifetime of the \ninsulation structure within the ADM 3053.  \nAccelerated life testing is performed using voltage levels higher \nthan the rated continuous worki ng voltage. Acceleration factors for \nseveral operating conditions are determined, allowing calculation \nof the time to failure at the working voltage of interest.  The values \nshown in Table 5 summarize the peak voltages for 50  years of \nservice life in several operating conditions. In many cases, the \nworking voltage approved by agency testing is higher than the 50 \nyear service life  voltage. Operation at working voltages higher than \nthe service life voltage listed leads to premature insulation failure.  \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADM 3053 depends on the voltage \nwaveform type imposed across the isolation barrier.  The iCoupler \ninsul ation structure degrades at different rates, depending on \nwhether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 29, \nFigure 30, and Figure 31 illustrate these different isolation voltage \nwaveforms.  Bipolar ac voltage is the m ost stringent environment. A 50 year \noperating lifetime under the bipolar ac condition determines \nthe Anal og Devices recommended maximum working voltage.  \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insulation \nis significantly lower. This allows operation at higher working \nvoltages while still achieving a 50 year service life. The working \nvolta ges listed in Table 5 can be applied while maintaining the \n50 year minimum lifetime, provided the voltage conforms to either  \nthe unipolar ac or dc voltage cases. Any cross  insulation vo ltage \nwaveform that does not conform to Figure 30 or Figure 31 must  \nbe treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak voltage must  \nbe limited to the 50 -year lifetime voltage value listed in  Table 5. \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n09293-013 \nFigure 29.
