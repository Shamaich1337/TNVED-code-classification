Signal information, \nincluding a DC level, can be transmitted by the device while maintaining a high degree of electrical isolation between input and output. The ILD205T, ILD206T, ILD207T, ILD211T, and ILD213T come in a standard SOIC-8 small outline package for surface mounting which makes it ideally suited for high density applications wi th limited space. In addition \nto eliminating through-holes requirements, this package conforms to standards for surface mounted devices.A specified minimum and ma ximum CTR allows a narrow \ntolerance in the electrical design of the adjacent circuits. The high BV\nCEO of 70 V gives a higher safety margin compared \nto the industry standard of 30 V.FEATURES\n• Two channel coupler• SOIC-8 surface mountable package• Standard lead spacing of 0.05"• Available only on tape and reel option \n(conforms to EIA standard 481-2)\n• Isolation test voltage, 4000 V\nRMS\n• Compatible with dual wave, vapor phase and IR reflow \nsoldering\n• Material categorization: fo r definitions of compliance \nplease see www.vishay.com/doc?99912\nAGENCY APPROVALS\n• UL1577, file no.

**Description:**
The ILD205T is a dual-channel optocoupler that consists of a gallium arsenide infrared LED and a silicon NPN phototransistor. Its primary function is to transmit signal information, including DC levels, while providing a high degree of electrical isolation between the input and output. This makes it suitable for applications where electrical isolation is critical.

**Typical Applications:**
The ILD205T is commonly used in:
- Signal isolation in data communication systems.
- Power management applications where isolation is required between high and low voltage circuits.
- Industrial automation systems for interfacing between control and power circuits.
- Consumer electronics for signal processing and control applications.
- Any application requiring reliable isolation in a compact form factor, particularly in high-density environments.

This component is ideal for use in environments where space is limited, and it conforms to standards for surface-mounted devices, making it suitable for modern electronic assembly processes.
