To improve performance during line and load transients the device implements a constant-frequency,\npeak current mode control which reduces output capacitance. The optimized internal compensation network\nminimizes the external component counts and simplifies the control loop design.\nThe switching frequency is fixed to 500 kHz.\nThe device begins switching at VIN equal to 4.5 V. The operating current is 45 μA typically when not switching\nand under no load. When the device is disabled, the supply current is 2 µA typically.\nThe integrated 148-m Ω high-side MOSFET and 78-m Ω allow for high efficiency power supply designs with\ncontinuous output currents up to 2 A.\nThe device reduces the external component count by integrating the boot recharge diode. The bias voltage\nfor the integrated high-side MOSFET is supplied by an external capacitor on the BOOT to PH pins. The boot\ncapacitor voltage is monitored by an UVLO circuit and will turn the high-side MOSFET off when the voltage falls\nbelow a preset threshold of 2.1 V typically.\nThe device minimizes excessive output overvoltage transients by taking advantage of the overvoltage\ncomparator. When the regulated output voltage is greater than 108% of the nominal voltage, the overvoltage\ncomparator is activated, and the high-side MOSFET is turned off and masked from turning on until the output\nvoltage is lower than 104%.\nThe device has internal 5-ms soft-start time to minimize inrush currents.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nBOOT\nSWVIN EN\n-\n+\n+\nLS MOSFET\nCurrent LimitOscillatorMaximum\nClampOverload\nRecoverySoft StartVoltage \nReference\nSlope\nCompensationHS MOSFET\nCurrent \nComparatorMinimum Clamp\nPulse Skip\nPower Stage\nAnd\n Dead time\nControl\nLogicBoot UVLOBoot ChargeUVLOThermal \nHiccup\nShutdown \nLogic\nERROR AMPLIFIER\nRegulatorVIN-\n+OV comparator\n0.596VCurrent\nSense\nCurrent\nSenseFB\nGNDHiccup\nShutdownHiccup\nShutdown\nEN CompatatorIp Ih\n30 k:\n2.2nF2pF\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedTPS54202\nSLVSD26B – APRIL 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54202\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Fixed-Frequency PWM Control\nThe device uses a fixed-frequency, peak current-mode control. The output voltage is compared through external\nresistors on the FB pin to an internal voltage reference by an error amplifier. An internal oscillator initiates the\nturn on of the high-side power switch. The error amplifier output is compared to the current of the high-side\npower switch. When the power-switch current reaches the error amplifier output voltage level, the high side\npower switch is turned off and the low-side power switch is turned on. The error amplifier output voltage\nincreases and decreases as the output current increases and decreases. The device implements a current-limit\nby clamping the error amplifier voltage to a maximum level and also implements a minimum clamp for improved\ntransient-response performance.\n7.3.2 Pulse Skip Mode\nThe TPS54202 is designed to operate in pulse skipping mode at light load currents to boost light load efficiency.\nWhen the peak inductor current is lower than 300 mA typically, the device enters pulse skipping mode. When\nthe device is in pulse skipping mode, the error amplifier output voltage is clamped which prevents the high side\nintegrated MOSFET from switching. The peak inductor current must rise above 300 mA and exit pulse skip\nmode. Since the integrated current comparator catches the peak inductor current only, the average load current\nentering pulse skipping mode varies with the applications and external output filters.\n7.3.3 Error Amplifier\nThe device has a trans-conductance amplifier as the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the FB voltage\nto the lower of the internal soft-start voltage or the internal 0596 -V voltage reference. The transconductance of\nthe error amplifier is 240 µA/V typically. The frequency compensation components are placed internal between\nthe output of the error amplifier and ground.\n7.3.4 Slope Compensation and Output Current\nThe device adds a compensating ramp to the signal of the switch current. This slope compensation prevents\nsub-harmonic oscillations as the duty cycle increases. The available peak inductor current remains constant over\nthe full duty-cycle range.\n7.3.5 Enable and Adjusting Under Voltage Lockout\nThe EN pin provides electrical on and off control of the device. When the EN pin voltage exceeds the threshold\nvoltage, the device begins operation. If the EN pin voltage is pulled below the threshold voltage, the regulator\nstops switching and enters the low-quiescent (IQ) state.\nThe EN pin has an internal pullup-current source which allows the user to float the EN pin to enable the device.\nIf an application requires control of the EN pin, use open-drain or open-collector output logic to interface with the\npin.\nThe device implements internal undervoltage-lockout (UVLO) circuitry on the VIN pin. The device is disabled\nwhen the VIN pin voltage falls below the internal VIN UVLO threshold. The internal VIN UVLO threshold has a\nhysteresis of 480 mV.\nIf an application requires a higher UVLO threshold on the VIN pin, then the EN pin can be configured as shown\nin Figure 7-1 . When using the external UVLO function, setting the hysteresis at a value greater than 500 mV is\nrecommended.\nThe EN pin has a small pull-up current, Ip, which sets the default state of the pin to enable when no external\ncomponents are connected. The pull-up current is also used to control the voltage hysteresis for the UVLO\nfunction because it increases by Ih when the EN pin crosses the enable threshold. Use Equation 1  and Equation\n2 to calculate the values of R4 and R5 for a specified UVLO threshold.www.ti.comTPS54202\nSLVSD26B – APRIL 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54202\nENIp IhR4\nR5VIN DeviceFigure 7-1.

During\nmonotonic pre-biased startup, both high-side and low-side MOSFETs are not allowed to be turned on until the\ninternal soft-start voltage is higher than FB pin voltage.\n7.3.7 Voltage Reference\nThe voltage reference system produces a precise ±2.5% voltage-reference over temperature by scaling the\noutput of a temperature stable bandgap circuit. The typical voltage reference is designed at 0.596 V.\n7.3.8 Adjusting Output Voltage\nThe output voltage is set with a resistor divider from the output node to the FB pin. It is recommended to use\ndivider resistors with 1% tolerance or better. Start with a 100 k Ω for the upper resistor divider, use Equation 3\nto calculate the output voltage. To improve efficiency at light loads consider using larger value resistors. If the\nvalues are too high the regulator is more susceptible to noise and voltage errors from the FB input current are\nnoticeable.\nOUT refR2V V 1R3ª º  u \x0e« » ¬ ¼ \n(3)\n7.3.9 Internal Soft-Start\nThe TTPS54202 device uses the internal soft-start function.

A ceramic capacitor with an X7R or\nX5R grade dielectric is recommended because of the stable characteristics over temperature and voltage. To\nimprove drop out, the device is designed to operate at 100% duty cycle as long as the BOOT to SW pin voltage\nis greater than 2.1 V typically.\n7.3.11 Overcurrent Protection\nThe device is protected from overcurrent conditions by cycle-by-cycle current limiting on both the high-side\nMOSFET and the low-side MOSFET.\n7.3.11.1 High-Side MOSFET Overcurrent Protection\nThe device implements current mode control which uses the internal COMP voltage to control the turn off of the\nhigh-side MOSFET and the turn on of the low-side MOSFET on a cycle-by-cycle basis. During each cycle, the\nswitch current and the current reference generated by the internal COMP voltage are compared. When the peak\nswitch current intersects the current reference the high-side switch turns off.\n7.3.11.2 Low-Side MOSFET Overcurrent Protection\nWhile the low-side MOSFET is turned on, the conduction current is monitored by the internal circuitry. During\nnormal operation the low-side MOSFET sources current to the load. At the end of every clock cycle, the low-side\nMOSFET sourcing current is compared to the internally set low-side sourcing current-limit. The inductor valley\ncurrent is exceeded the low-side source current limit, the high-side MOSFET does not turn on and the low-side\nMOSFET stays on for the next cycle. The high-side MOSFET turns on again when the inductor valley current is\nbelow the low-side sourcing current-limit at the start of a cycle as shown in Figure 7-2 .\nI(LIM_HS)\nI(LIM_LS)IL\nHigh-Side\nMOS FET\nLow-Side\nMOS FETSkip pulse when I L is \nhigher than I(LIM_LS)Skip pulse when I L is \nhigher than I(LIM_LS)\nt t t t\nFigure 7-2. Overcurrent Protection for Both MOSFETs\nFurthermore, if an output overload condition occurs for more than the hiccup wait time, which is programmed for\n512 switching cycles, the device shuts down and restarts after the hiccup time of 16384 cycles. The hiccup mode\nhelps to reduce the device power dissipation under severe overcurrent conditions.www.ti.comTPS54202\nSLVSD26B – APRIL 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54202\n7.3.12 Spread Spectrum\nIn order to reduce EMI, TPS54202  introduces frequency spread spectrum.

Frequency Spread Spectrum Diagram\n7.3.13 Output Overvoltage Protection (OVP)\nThe TPS54202  incorporates an overvoltage transient protection (OVTP) circuit to minimize output voltage\novershoot when recovering from output fault conditions or strong unload transients. The OVTP circuit includes\nan overvoltage comparator to compare the FB pin voltage and internal thresholds. When the FB pin voltage goes\nabove 108% × Vref, the high-side MOSFET will be forced off. When the FB pin voltage falls below 104% × Vref,\nthe high-side MOSFET will be enabled again.\n7.3.14 Thermal Shutdown\nThe internal thermal-shutdown circuitry forces the device to stop switching if the junction temperature exceeds\n155°C typically. When the junction temperature drops below 145°C typically, the internal thermal-hiccup timer\nbegins to count. The device reinitiates the power-up sequence after the built-in thermal-shutdown hiccup time\n(32768 cycles) is over.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Normal Operation\nWhen the input voltage is above the UVLO threshold, the TPS54202  can operate in their normal switching\nmodes. Normal continuous conduction mode (CCM) occurs when inductor peak current is above 0 A. In CCM,\nthe device operates at a fixed frequency.\n7.4.2 Eco-mode™ Operation\nThe devices are designed to operate in high-efficiency pulse-skipping mode under light load conditions. Pulse\nskipping initiates when the switch current falls to 0 A. During pulse skipping, the low-side FET turns off when\nthe switch current falls to 0 A. The switching node (the SW pin) waveform takes on the characteristics of\ndiscontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation and the apparent switching frequency decreases. As the\noutput current decreases, the perceived time between switching pulses increases.TPS54202\nSLVSD26B – APRIL 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54202\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,\nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

An additional 0.1 µF capacitor\n(C2) from VIN to GND is optional to provide additional high frequency filtering. The capacitor voltage rating\nneeds to be greater than the maximum input voltage.\nUse Equation 4  to calculate the input ripple voltage (ΔV IN).\n/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41OUT MAX\nIN MAX OUT MAX\nBULK swI /CharA0 0.25\nV I ESRC f/c180\n/c68 /c61 /c43 /c180/c180\n(4)\nwhere:\n• C BULK is the bulk capacitor value\n• f SW is the switching frequency\n• I OUT(MAX)  is the maximum loading current\n• ESR MAX is maximum series resistance of the bulk capacitor\nThe maximum RMS (root mean square) ripple current must also be checked. For worst case conditions, use\nEquation 5  to calculate I CIN(RMS) .\nOUT(MAX)\nCIN(RMS)I\nI2 \n(5)\nThe actual input-voltage ripple is greatly affected by parasitic associated with the layout and the output\nimpedance of the voltage source. Design Requirements show the actual input voltage ripple for this circuit which\nis larger than the calculated value. This measured value is still below the specified input limit of 400 mV. The\nmaximum voltage across the input capacitors is VIN (MAX) + ΔVIN/2. The selected bypass capacitor is rated\nfor 35 V and the ripple current capacity is greater than 2 A. Both values provide ample margin. The maximum\nratings for voltage and current must not be exceeded under any circumstance.\n8.2.3.2 Bootstrap Capacitor Selection\nA 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor must be connected between the BOOT to SW pin for proper operation. It is\nrecommended to use a ceramic capacitor.\n8.2.3.3 Output Voltage Set Point\nThe output voltage of the TPS54202  device is externally adjustable using a resistor divider network. In the\napplication circuit of Figure 8-1  , this divider network is comprised of R2 and R3. Use Equation 6  and Equation 7\nto calculate the relationship of the output voltage to the resistor divider.\nref\nOUT refR2 VR3V V/c180/c61/c45\n(6)\nOUT refR2V V 1R3ª º  u \x0e« » ¬ ¼ \n(7)\nSelect a value of R2 to be approximately 100 k Ω. Slightly increasing or decreasing R3 can result in closer output\nvoltage matching when using standard value resistors. In this design, R2 = 100 k Ω and R3 = 13.3 k Ω which\nresults in a 5-V output voltage. The 49.9- Ω resistor, R1, is provided as a convenient location to break the control\nloop for stability testing.TPS54202\nSLVSD26B – APRIL 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54202\n8.2.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout Set Point\nThe undervoltage lockout (UVLO) set point can be adjusted using the external-voltage divider network of R4 and\nR5. R4 is connected between the VIN and EN pins of the TPS54202  device. R5 is connected between the EN\nand GND pins. The UVLO has two thresholds, one for power up when he input voltage is rising and one for\npower down or brown outs when the input voltage is falling. For the example design, the minimum input voltage\nis 8 V, so the start-voltage threshold is set to 6.8 V with 1000-mV hysteresis. Use Equation 1  and Equation 2  to\ncalculate the values for the upper and lower resistor values of R4 and R5.\n8.2.3.5 Output Filter Components\nTwo components must be selected for the output filter, the output inductor (L O) and C O.\n8.2.3.5.1 Inductor Selection\nUse Equation 8  to calculate the minimum value of the output inductor (L MIN).\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41OUT OUT IN MAX\nIND OUT sw INMIN\nMAXV V V\nV fLK I/c180 /c45\n/c61/c180 /c180 /c180\n(8)\nWhere:\nKIND is a coefficient that represents the amount of inductor ripple current relative to the maximum output current.\nIn general, the value of K IND is at the discretion of the designer; however, the following guidelines may be used.\nFor designs using low-ESR output capacitors, such as ceramics, a value as high as K IND = 0.3 can be used.\nWhen using higher ESR output capacitors, K IND = 0.2 yields better results.\nFor this design example, use K IND = 0.3. The minimum inductor value is calculated as 13.7 μH. For this design, a\nclose standard value of 15 μH was selected for L MIN.\nFor the output filter inductor, the RMS current and saturation current ratings must not be exceeded. Use\nEquation 9  to calculate the RMS inductor current (I L(RMS) ).\n\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\n\x0b \x0c2\nOUT OUT IN MAX2\nOUT MAX\nO SW IN MAL( AX\nXM ) V V V1I12 V L f 0.8I§ · u \x10 ¨ ¸  \x0e u¨ ¸ u u u¨ ¸ © ¹ \n(9)\nUse Equation 10  to calculate the peak inductor current (I L(PK)).\n\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\n\x0b \x0cOUT OUT IN MA\nL(X\nOUT MAX\nO SW IN MAPK)\nXV V V\nI1.6 V LIfu \x10 \n \x0e u u u\n(10)\nSmaller or larger inductor values can be used depending on the amount of ripple current the designer wants to\nallow so long as the other design requirements are met. Larger value inductors have lower AC current and result\nin lower output voltage ripple. Smaller inductor values increase AC current and output voltage ripple.\n8.2.3.5.2 Output Capacitor Selection\nConsider three primary factors when selecting the value of the output capacitor. The output capacitor determines\nthe modulator pole, the output voltage ripple, and how the regulator responds to a large change in load current.\nThe output capacitance must be selected based on the more stringent of these three criteria.\nThe desired response to a large change in the load current is the first criterion. The output capacitor must supply\nthe load with current when the regulator cannot. This situation occurs if the desired hold-up times are present for\nthe regulator. In this case, the output capacitor must hold the output voltage above a certain level for a specified\namount of time after the input power is removed. The regulator is also temporarily unable to supply sufficientwww.ti.comTPS54202\nSLVSD26B – APRIL 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54202\noutput current if a large, fast increase occurs affecting the current requirements of the load, such as a transition\nfrom no load to full load. The regulator usually requires two or more clock cycles for the control loop to notice\nthe change in load current and output voltage and to adjust the duty cycle to react to the change. The output\ncapacitor must be sized to supply the extra current to the load until the control loop responds to the load change.\nThe output capacitance must be large enough to supply the difference in current for 2 clock cycles while only\nallowing a tolerable amount of drop in the output voltage. Use Equation 11  to calculate the minimum required\noutput capacitance.\nOUT\nO\nsw OUT2 I Cf V u\'!u\'\n(11)\nwhere:\n• ∆I OUT is the change in output current\n• ƒ SW is the switching frequency of the regulator\n• ∆V (OUT ) b is the allowable change in the output voltage\nFor this example, the transient load response is specified as a 5% change in the output voltage, V OUT, for a load\nstep of 1.5 A. For this example, ΔIOUT = 1.5 A and ΔVOUT = 0.05 × 5 = 0.25 V. Using these values results in\na minimum capacitance of 24 μF. This value does not consider the ESR of the output capacitor in the output\nvoltage change. For ceramic capacitors, the ESR is usually small enough to ignore in this calculation.\nEquation 12  calculates the minimum output capacitance required to meet the output voltage ripple specification.\nIn this case, the maximum output voltage ripple is 30 mV. Under this requirement, Equation 12  yields 4.56 μF.\nO\nOUTripple SW\nripple1 1CV 8 f\nI/c180/c62 /c180\n(12)\nwhere:\n• ƒ SW is the switching frequency\n• V (OUTripple)  is the maximum allowable output voltage ripple\n• I (ripple)  is the inductor ripple current\nUse Equation 13  to calculate the maximum ESR an output capacitor can have to meet the output-voltage ripple\nspecification. Equation 13  indicates the ESR should be less than 54.8 m Ω. In this case, the ESR of the ceramic\ncapacitor is much smaller than 54.8 mΩ.\nOUTripple\nESR\nrippleV\nRI/c60\n(13)\nThe output capacitor can affect the crossover frequency ƒ o. Considering to the loop stability and effect of the\ninternal parasitic parameters, choose the crossover frequency less than 40 kHz without considering the feed\nforward capacitor. A simple estimation for the crossover frequency without feed forward capacitor C6 is shown in\nEquation 14 , assuming C OUT has small ESR.\no\nOUT OUT3.95= V C  uf\n(14)\nAdditional capacitance deratings for aging, temperature, and DC bias should be considered which increases\nthis minimum value. For this example, two 22-uF 25-V, X7R ceramic capacitors are used. Capacitors generally\nhave limits to the amount of ripple current they can handle without failing or producing excess heat. An output\ncapacitor that can support the inductor ripple current must be specified. Some capacitor data sheets specify the\nRMS value of the maximum ripple current. Use Equation 15  to calculate the RMS ripple current that the output\ncapacitor must support. For this application, Equation 15  yields 79 mA for each capacitor.TPS54202\nSLVSD26B – APRIL 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54202\n\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\n\x0b \x0cOUT OUT IN MAX\nCOUT RMS\nO SW C IN MAXV V V1IV L f N 12§ · u \x10 ¨ ¸  u ¨ ¸ u u u¨ ¸ © ¹ (15)\n8.2.3.5.3 Feed-Forward Capacitor\nThe TPS54202  device is internally compensated and the internal compensation network is composed of two\ncapacitors and one resister shown on the block diagram. Depending on the V OUT, if the output capacitor C OUT\nis dominated by low ESR (ceramic types) capacitors, it could result in low phase margin. To improve the phase\nboost an external feedforward capacitor C6 can be added in parallel with R2. C6 is chosen such that phase\nmargin is boosted at the crossover frequency.\nEquation 16  for C6 was tested:\no1 1 C6 = 2 f R2uS\n(16)\nFor this design, C6 = 75 pF. C6 is not needed when C OUT has high ESR, and C6 calculated from Equation 16\nshould be reduced with medium ESR. Table 8-2  can be used as a starting point.\nTable 8-2.
