The AD9642 is designed to \nsupport communications applications, where low cost, small \nsize, wide bandwidth, and versatility are desired. \nThe ADC core features a multistage, differential pipelined \narchitecture with integrated output error correction logic. The ADC features wide bandwidth inputs that can support a variety of user-selectable input ranges. An integrated voltage reference \neases design considerations. A duty cycle stabilizer (DCS) is \nprovided to compensate for variations in the ADC clock duty \ncycle, allowing the converter to maintain excellent performance. \nThe ADC output data is routed directly to the external  \n14-bit LVDS output port. \nFlexible power-down options allow significant power savings, \nwhen desired. Programming for setup and control is accomplished using a  \n3-wire SPI-compatible serial interface. \nThe AD9642 is available in a 32-lead LFCSP and is specified \nover the industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C. This \nproduct is protected by a U.S. patent. \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Integrated 14-bit, 170 MSPS/210 MSPS/250 MSPS ADC. \n2. Operation from a single 1.8 V supply and a separate digital \noutput driver supply accommodating LVDS outputs. \n3. Proprietary differential input maintains excellent SNR performance for input frequencies of up to 350 MHz. \n4. 3-pin, 1.8 V SPI port for register programming and readback. \n5. Pin compatibility with the AD9634, allowing a simple migra-\ntion from 14 bits to 12 bits, and with the AD6672 . \n \nAD9642  Data Sheet  \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nFeatures  .............................................................................................. 1 \nApplications  ....................................................................................... 1 \nFunctional Block  Diagram  .............................................................. 1 \nGeneral Description  ......................................................................... 1 \nProduct Highlights  ........................................................................... 1 \nRevision History  ............................................................................... 2 \nSpecifications  ..................................................................................... 3 \nADC DC Specifi cations  ............................................................... 3 \nADC AC Specifications  ............................................................... 4 \nDigital Specifications  ................................................................... 5 \nSwitching Specifications  .............................................................. 6 \nTiming Specifications  .................................................................. 7 \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  ............................................................ 8 \nThermal Characteristics  .............................................................. 8 \nESD Caution  .................................................................................. 8 \nPin Configurations and Function Descriptions  ........................... 9 \nTypical Performance Characteristics  ........................................... 10 \nEquivalent Circuits  ......................................................................... 16 Theory of Operation  ...................................................................... 17 \nADC Architecture ...................................................................... 17 \nAnalog Input  Considerations  ................................................... 17 \nVoltage Reference ....................................................................... 19 \nClock Input Considerations  ...................................................... 19 \nPower Dissipation and Standby Mode  .................................... 20 \nDigital Outputs  ........................................................................... 20 \nSerial  Port Interface (SPI)  .............................................................. 22 \nConfiguration Using the SPI  ..................................................... 22 \nHardware Interface  ..................................................................... 22 \nSPI Accessible Features  .............................................................. 23 \nMemo ry Map  .................................................................................. 24 \nReading the Memory Map Register Table  ............................... 24 \nMemory Map Register Table  ..................................................... 25 \nApplications Information  .............................................................. 27 \nDesign Guidelines  ...................................................................... 27 \nOutl ine Dimensions  ....................................................................... 28 \nOrdering Guide  .......................................................................... 28 \n \nREVISION  HISTORY  \n1/15— Rev.

B | Page 17 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD9642 can sample any f S/2 frequency segment from dc to \n250 MHz using appropriate low-pass or band-pass filtering at \nthe ADC inputs with little loss in ADC performance. \nProgramming and control of the AD9642 are accomplished \nusing a 3-pin, SPI-compatible serial interface. \nADC ARCHITECTURE \nThe AD9642 architecture consists of a front-end sample-and-\nhold circuit, followed by a pipelined switched-capacitor ADC. \nThe quantized outputs from each stage are combined into a \nfinal 14-bit result in the digital correction logic. The pipelined \narchitecture permits the first stage to operate on a new input sample and the remaining stages to operate on the preceding \nsamples. Sampling occurs on the rising edge of the clock. \nEach stage of the pipeline, excluding the last, consists of a low \nresolution flash ADC connected to a switched-capacitor digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and an interstage residue amplifier \n(MDAC). The MDAC magnifies the difference between the \nreconstructed DAC output and the flash input for the next stage in the pipeline. One bit of redundancy is used in each stage to facilitate digital correction of flash errors. The last stage simply \nconsists of a flash ADC. \nThe input stage of the AD9642 contains a differential sampling \ncircuit that can be ac- or dc-coupled in differential or single-\nended modes. The output staging block aligns the data, corrects \nerrors, and passes the data to the output buffers. The output buffers are powered from a separate supply, allowing digital output noise to be separated from the analog core. During \npower-down, the output buffers go into a high impedance state. \nANALOG INPUT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe analog input to the AD9642 is a differential switched-\ncapacitor circuit that has been designed to attain optimum \nperformance when processing a differential input signal. \nThe clock signal alternatively switches the input between \nsample mode and hold mode (see the configuration shown in \nFigure 46). When the input is switched into sample mode, the signal source must be capable of charging the sampling \ncapacitors and settling within 1/2 clock cycle. \nA small resistor in series with each input can help reduce the \npeak transient current required from the output stage of the driving source. A shunt capacitor can be placed across the \ninputs to provide dynamic charging currents. This passive \nnetwork creates a low-pass filter at the ADC input; therefore, \nthe precise values are dependent on the application. \nIn intermediate frequency (IF) undersampling applications, the \nshunt capacitors should be reduced. In combination with the driving source impedance, the shunt capacitors limit the input bandwidth. Refer to the AN-742 Application Note , Frequency \nDomain Response of Switched-Capacitor ADCs ; the AN-827 \nApplication Note , A Resonant Approach to Interfacing Amplifiers \nto Switched-Capacitor ADCs ; and the Analog Dialogue  article, “Transformer-Coupled Front-End for Wideband A/D Converters ,”  \nfor more information on this subject. \nCPAR1\nCPAR1CPAR2\nCPAR2SS\nSS\nSSCFB\nCFBCS\nCSBIAS\nBIASVIN+\n09995-043H\nVIN–\n \nFigure 46. Switche d-Capacitor Input \nFor best dynamic performance, match the source impedances \ndriving VIN+ and VIN− and differentially balance the inputs. \nInput Common Mode \nThe analog inputs of the AD9642  are not internally dc biased. \nIn ac-coupled applications, the user must provide this bias \nexternally. Setting the device so that V CM = 0.5 × AVDD (or \n0.9 V) is recommended for optimum performance. An on-board common-mode voltage reference is included in the design and is available from the VCM pin. Using the VCM output to set the input common mode is recommended. Optimum performance is achieved when the common-mode \nvoltage of the analog input is set by the VCM pin voltage \n(typically 0.5 × AVDD). The VCM pin must be decoupled to ground by a 0.1 μF capacitor, as described in the Applications Information section. Place this decoupling capacitor close to the pin to minimize the series resistance and inductance between the part and this capacitor. \nDifferential Input Configurations \nOptimum performance can be achieved when driving the AD9642 \nin a differential input configuration. For baseband applications, the AD8138, ADA4937-1 , and ADA4930-1  differential drivers \nprovide excellent performance and a flexible interface to the ADC. \nThe output common-mode voltage of the ADA4930-1  is easily \nset with the VCM pin of the AD9642 (see Figure 47), and the \ndriver can be configured in a Sallen-Key filter topology to \nprovide band-limiting of the input signal. \nVIN 76.8Ω\n120Ω0.1µF\n200Ω200Ω\n90ΩAVDD33Ω\n33Ω15Ω\n15Ω5pF15p\nF\n15pFADCVIN–\nVIN+ VCMADA4930-1\n09995-0440.1µF\n \nFigure 47.

Differential Transformer -Coupled Configuration  \nThe signal characteristics must be considered when selecting  \na transformer. Most RF transformers saturate at frequencies \nbelow a few megahertz . Excessive signal power can also cause \ncore saturation, which leads to distortion.  \nAt input frequencies in the second Nyquist zone and above, the noise performance of most amplifiers is not adequate to achieve the true SNR performance of the AD9642. For applications where  \nSNR is a key parameter, differential double balun coupling is \nthe recommended input configuration  (see Figure 50). In this \nconfiguration, the input is ac -coupled and the VCM voltage is \nprovided to  each input through a 33 Ω resistor . This resistor \ncompensate s for losses in the input baluns to provide  a 50 Ω \nimpedance to the driver.  \nIn the double balun and transformer configurations, the value \nof the input capacitors and resistors is dependent on th e input \nfrequency and source impedance. Based on these parameters , \nthe value of the input resistors and capacitors may need to be adjusted or some components may need to be removed. Table 9 \ndisplays recommended values  to set the RC network for different  \ninput frequency ranges. However, these values are dependent on the input signal and bandwidth and should be used only as a starting guide. Note that the values given in Table 9 are for each \nR1, R2, C2, and R3 component shown in Figure 48 and Figure 50. \nTable 9.

The input span of the ADC tracks reference voltage \nchanges linearly.  \nCLOCK INPUT CONSIDERATIONS \nFor optimum performance, the AD9642 sample clock inputs, \nCLK+ and CLK−, should be clocked with a differential signal. \nThe signal is typically ac-coupled into the CLK+ and CLK− pins \nvia a transformer or via capacitors. These pins are biased internally \n(see Figure 51) and require no external bias. If the inputs are \nfloated, the CLK− pin is pulled low to prevent spurious clocking. \n09995-048AVDD\nCLK+\n4pF 4pFCLK–0.9V\n \nFigure 51. Simplified Equivalent Clock Input Circuit \nClock Input Options \nThe AD9642 has a very flexible clock input structure. Clock input \ncan be a CMOS, LVDS, LVPECL, or sine wave signal. Regardless \nof the type of signal being used, clock source jitter is of the most \nconcern, as described in the Jitter Considerations section. \nFigure 52 and Figure 53 show two preferable methods for \nclocking the AD9642 (at clock rates of up to 625 MHz). A low jitter clock source is converted from a single-ended signal to a differential signal using an RF balun or RF transformer.  \nThe RF balun configuration is recommended for clock \nfrequencies between 125 MHz and 625 MHz, and the RF \ntransformer is recommended for clock frequencies from 10 MHz to 200 MHz. The back-to-back Schottky diodes across the secondary winding of the transformer limit clock excursions into the AD9642 to approximately 0.8 V p-p differential. This \nlimit helps prevent the large voltage swings of the clock from feeding through to other portions of the AD9642  while \npreserving the fast rise and fall times of the signal, which are \ncritical for low jitter performance. \n390pF390pF 390pF\nSCHOTTKY\nDIODES:\nHSMS2822CLOCK\nINPUT\n50Ω100Ω\nCLK–CLK+ADCMini-Circuits®\nADT1-1WT, 1:1Z\nXFMR\n09995-056 \nFigure 52.

Differential LVDS Sample Clock (Up to 625 MHz) \nInput Clock Divider \nThe AD9642 contains an input clock divider with the ability to \ndivide the input clock by integer values between 1 and 8. The \nduty cycle stabilizer (DCS) is enabled by default on power-up. \nClock Duty Cycle \nTypical high speed ADCs use both clock edges to generate a \nvariety of internal timing signals and, as a result, may be \nsensitive to clock duty cycle. Commonly, a ±5% tolerance is required on the clock duty cycle to maintain dynamic performance characteristics. \nThe AD9642 contains a DCS that retimes the nonsampling \n(falling) edge, providing an internal clock signal with a nominal \n50% duty cycle. This allows the user to provide a wide range of clock input duty cycles without affecting the performance of the \nAD9642. \nAD9642 Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 20 of 28 Jitter on the rising edge of the input clock is still of paramount \nconcern and is not reduced by the duty cycle stabilizer. The duty cycle control loop does not function for clock rates less than 40 MHz nominally. The loop has a time constant associated \nwith it that must be considered when the clock rate may change \ndynamically. A wait time of 1.5 μs to 5 μs is required after a dynamic clock frequency increase or decrease before the DCS loop is relocked to the input signal. During the time that the loop is not locked, the DCS loop is bypassed, and internal device timing \nis dependent on the duty cycle of the input clock signal. In such \napplications, it may be appropriate to disable the duty cycle stabilizer. In all other applications, enabling the DCS circuit is \nrecommended to maximize ac performance. \nJitter Considerations \nHigh speed, high resolution ADCs are sensitive to the quality of \nthe clock input. The degradation in SNR at a given input \nfrequency (f IN) due to jitter (t J) can be calculated by \nSNR HF = −10 log[(2π × fIN × tJRMS)2 + 10) 10 / (LFSNR\uf02d] \nIn the equation, the rms aperture jitter represents the root-\nmean-square of all jitter sources, which include the clock input, the analog input signal, and the ADC aperture jitter specification.

AD9642-250  SNR vs. Input Frequency and Jitter \nIn cases where aperture jitter may affect the dynamic range of the \nAD9642, treat the clock input as an analog signal. In addition, \nuse separate power supplies for the clock drivers and the ADC \noutput driver to avoid modulating the clock signal with digital noise. Low jitter, crystal controlled oscillators provide the best clock sources. If the clock is generated from another type of source (by gating, dividing, or another method), it should be retimed by the original clock during the last step. \nRefer to the AN-501 Application Note , Aperture Uncertainty and \nADC System Performance , and the AN-756 Application Note , \nSampled Systems and the Effects of Clock Phase Noise and Jitter , for \nmore information about jitter performance as it relates to ADCs. POWER DISSIPATION AND STANDBY MODE \nAs shown in Figure 57, the power dissipated by the AD9642 is \nproportional to its sample rate.

AD9642-250  Power and Current vs. Sample Rate \nBy setting the internal power-down mode bits (Bits[1:0]) in the \npower modes register (Address 0x08) to 01, the AD9642 is \nplaced in power-down mode. In this state, the ADC typically dissipates 2.5 mW . During power-down, the output drivers are placed in a high impedance state.  \nLow power dissipation in power-down mode is achieved by \nshutting down the reference, reference buffer, biasing networks, and clock. Internal capacitors are discharged when entering power-down mode and then must be recharged when returning to normal operation. As a result, the wake-up time is related to the time spent in power-down mode, and shorter power-down cycles result in proportionally shorter wake-up times. \nWhen using the SPI port interface, the user can place the ADC \nin power-down mode or standby mode. Standby mode allows the user to keep the internal reference circuitry powered when faster wake-up times are required. To put the part into standby mode, set the internal power-down mode bits (Bits[1:0]) in the power modes register (Address 0x08) to 10. See the Memory \nMap section and the AN-877 Application Note , Interfacing  to \nHigh Speed ADCs via SPI , for additional details. \nDIGITAL OUTPUTS \nThe AD9642 output drivers can be configured for either ANSI \nLVDS or reduced swing LVDS using a 1.8 V DRVDD supply. \nAs detailed in the AN-877 Application Note , Interfacing to High \nSpeed ADCs via SPI , the data format can be selected for offset \nbinary, twos complement, or gray code when using the SPI control.  \nDigital Output Enable Function (OEB) \nThe AD9642 has a flexible three-state ability for the digital \noutput pins. The three-state mode is enabled using the SPI \ninterface. The data outputs can be three-stated by using the output enable bar bit (Bit 4) in Register 0x14. This OEB \nfunction is not intended for rapid access to the data bus.  \nData Sheet  AD9642  \n \nTiming  \nThe AD9642 provides latched data with a pipeline de lay of \n10 input sample clock cycles. Data outputs are available one \npropagation delay (t PD) after the rising edge of the clock signal.  \nMinimize t he length of the output data lines a s well as the  loads \nplaced on the se lines  to reduce transients within the AD9642. \nThese transients may  degrade converter  dynamic performance.  The lowe st typical conversion rate of the AD9642 is 40 MSPS. \nAt clock rates below 4 0 MSPS, dynamic performance may \ndegrade.  \nData Clock Output (DCO)  \nThe AD9642 also provides the data clock output (DCO) intended  \nfor capturing the data in an external regis ter.

B | Page 21 of 28 \nAD9642  Data Sheet  \n \nSERIAL PORT INTERFACE (SPI)  \nThe AD9642 serial port interface (SPI) allows the user to \nconfigure the converter for specific functions or operations \nthrough a structured register space provided inside the ADC. \nThe SPI offers  added flexibility and customization, depending \non the application. Addresses are accessed via the serial port and can be written to or read from via the port. Memory is organized into bytes that can  be further divided into fields. \nThese fields  are documented in the Memory Map  section. For \ndetailed operational information, see  the AN-877 Application \nNote , Interfacing to High Speed ADCs via SPI . \nCONFIGURATION USING THE SPI  \nThree pins define the SPI of this ADC: the SCLK  pin, the SDIO  pin, \nand the CSB pin  (see Table 11). The SCLK  (serial clock)  pin is \nused to synchronize the read and write d ata presented from  and \nto the ADC. The SDIO  (seri al data input/output)  pin is a dual -\npurpose pin that allows data to be sent and read from the internal  \nADC memory map registers. The CSB  (chip select bar)  pin is an \nactive  low control that enables or disab les the read and write cycles.  \nTable 11. Serial Port Interface Pins  \nPin Function  \nSCLK  Serial clock . The serial shift clock input, which is used to \nsynchronize serial interface reads and writes.  \nSDIO  Serial data input/output . A dual -purpose pin that \ntypically serves as an input or an output, depending on \nthe instruction being sent a nd the relative position in the \ntiming frame.  \nCSB  Chip select bar . An active low control that gates the read \nand write cycles.  \n \nThe falling edge of CSB, in conjunction with the rising edge of \nSCLK, determines the start of the framing. An example of the serial timing and its definitions can be found in Figure 58 and \nTable 5.  \nOther modes involving the CSB are available. The CSB can be held low indefinitely, which permanently enables the device; this is called streaming. The CSB can stall high between bytes  \nto allow for additional external timing. When CSB is tied high, \nSPI functions are placed in a high impedance mode. This mode \nturns on any SPI pin secondary functions.  \nDuring an instruction phase, a 16 -bit instruction is transmitted. \nData follows the instructi on phase, and its length is determined \nby the W0  and W1 bit s. All data is composed of 8 -bit words. The first bit of each \nindividual byte of serial data indicates whether a read or write command is issued. This allows the serial data input/output (SDIO) pi n to change direction from an input to an output.  \nIn addition to word length, the instruction phase determines whether the serial frame is a read or write operation, allowing \nthe serial port to be used both to program the chip and to read the  \ncontents of t he on -chip memory. If the instruction is a readback \noperation, performing a readbac k causes the serial data input/  \noutput (SDIO) pin to change direction from an input to an output  \nat the appropriate point in the serial frame.  \nData can be sent in MSB first mode or in LSB  first mode. MSB first  \nmode  is the default on power -up and can be changed via the SPI \nport configuration register. For more information about this and  \nother features, see the AN-877 Application Note , Interfacing to \nHigh Speed ADCs via SPI . \nHARDWARE INTERFACE  \nThe pins described in Table 11 comp rise the physical interface \nbetween the user programmin g device and the serial port of the \nAD9642. The SCLK pin and the CSB pin function as inputs when using the SPI interface. The SDIO pin is bidirectional , \nfunctioning as an input during write phases and as an output during readback.  \nThe SPI interface is flexible enough to be controlled by either \nFPGAs or microcontrollers. One method for SPI configuration \nis described in detail in the AN-812 Application Note , Micro -\ncontroller -Based Serial Port Interface (SPI) Boot Circuit .  \nThe SPI port should not be active during periods when the full dynamic performance of the converter is required. Because the SCLK signal, the CSB signal, and the SDIO signal are typically \nasynchronous to the ADC clock, noise from these signals can \ndegrade converter performance. If the on -board SPI bus is used for  \nother devices, it may be necessary to provide buffers between \nthis bus and the AD9642 to pr event these signals from transi -\ntioning at the converter in puts during critical sampling periods. \nRev.

For example, Address 0x14, the output mode register,  \nhas a hexadecimal default value of 0x0 1. This means that Bit 0 = 1  \nand the remaining bits are 0s. This setting is the default output \nformat value, which is twos complement. For more informati on \non this function and others, see the AN -877 Application Note , \nInterfacing to High Speed ADCs via SPI . This document details \nthe functions controlled b y Register 0x00 to Register 0x20 .  \nOpen  Locations  \nAll address and bit locations that are not included in Table 13  are \nnot currently supported for this device. Write 0s to unused bits of a val id address location. Writing to these locations is required \nonly when part of an address location is open (for example, Address 0x18). If the entire address location is open (for example, Address 0x13), this address location should not be written.  \nDefault  Values  \nAfter the AD9642 is reset, critical registers are loaded with \ndefault values. The default values for the registers are given i n \nthe memory map register table  (Table 13). \nLogic Levels  \nAn explanation of logic level terminology follows:  \n• “Bit is set” is synonymous with “bit is set to Logic 1” or “writing Logic 1 for the bit. ”  \n• “Clear a bit” is synonymous with “bit is set to Logic 0” or \n“writing Logic 0 for the bit. ”  \nTransfer Register Map  \nAddress 0x08 to Address 0x 20 are shadowed. Writes to these \naddresses do not affect part operation until a transfer command is issued by writing 0x01 to Address 0xFF, setting the transfer bit. This allows these registers to be updated internally and simultaneously when the transfer bit  is set. The internal update \ntakes place when the transfer bit is set, and then the bit autoclears.  \n \nRev.

B | Page 26 of 28 \nData Sheet  AD9642  \n \nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nDESIGN GUIDELINES  \nBefore starting system  level design and layout of the AD9642,  \nit is recommended that the designer become familiar with these \nguidelines, which discuss the special circuit connections and \nlayout requirements for certain pins.  \nPower and Ground Recommendations  \nWhen connecting power to the AD9642, it is recommended that  \ntwo separate 1.8 V supplies be used: use one supply for analog \n(AVDD) and a separate supply for the digital outputs (DRVDD).  \nThe designer can employ several different decoupling capacitors to cover both high and low frequencies. Locate t hese capacitors \nclose to the point of entry at the PC board level and close to the pins of the part with minimal trace length.  \nA single PCB ground plane should be sufficient when using the AD9642. With proper decoupling and smart partitioning of the \nPCB analog, digital, and clock sections, optimum performance \ncan be  easily achieved.  \nExposed Paddle Thermal Heat Slug Recommendations  \nIt is mandatory that the exposed paddle on the underside of the ADC be connected to analog ground (AGND) to achieve the best electrical and thermal performance. A continuous, exposed \n(no solder mask) copper plane on the PCB should mate  to the \nAD9642 exposed paddle, Pin 0.  \nThe copper plane should have several vias to achieve the lowest \npossible resistive thermal path for heat dissipat ion to flow \nthrough the bottom of the PCB. These vias should be filled or plugged with nonconductive epoxy.  \nTo maximize the coverage and adhesion between the ADC  \nand the PCB, overlay a silkscreen to partition the continuous \nplane on the PCB into several u niform sections. This provides \nseveral tie points between the ADC and the PCB during the reflow process. Using one continuous plane with no partitions guarantees only one tie point between the ADC and the PCB. \nSee the evaluation board for a PCB layout exam ple. For detailed \ninformation about the packaging and PCB layout of chip scale \npackages,  refer to  the AN-772 Application Note , A Design and \nManufacturing Guide for the Lead Frame Chip Scale Packag e \n(LFCSP) . VCM  \nDecouple the VCM  pin to ground with a 0.1 μF capacitor, as \nshown in Figure 48. \nSPI Port  \nThe SPI port should not be active during periods when the full \ndynamic performance of the converter is required. Because the \nSCLK, CSB, and SDIO signals are typically asynchronous to the \nADC clock, noise from these signals can degrade converter performance . If the on -board SPI bus is used for other devices, \nit may be necessary to provide buffers between this bus and the AD9642 to keep these signals from transitioning at the \nconverter input  pins during critical sampling periods. \n \nRev.
