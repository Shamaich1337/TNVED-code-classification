### Component Summary: HFCN-6010+

**Description:**
The HFCN-6010+ is a high-pass filter designed for RF applications. It is a ceramic filter that operates within a frequency range of 6300 to 15000 MHz. The component is particularly noted for its small size, excellent power handling capabilities, and hermetically sealed construction, making it suitable for various high-frequency applications.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not specified in the datasheet; however, it is important to note that coupling capacitors are required if DC voltage is present at either input or output ports.
- **Current Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; the RF power input is a critical parameter.
- **Power Consumption:** RF Power Input of 37 W max at 25°C.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206-1 (small form factor).
- **Special Features:**
  - RoHS compliant.
  - Temperature stable.
  - Low cost.
  - Protected by US Patent 7,760,485.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided information.

**Typical Applications:**
The HFCN-6010+ is commonly used in:
- Point-to-point radio systems.
- Sub-harmonic rejection applications.
- Transmitters and receivers in communication systems.

This high-pass filter is ideal for applications requiring effective signal processing at high frequencies, ensuring that unwanted lower frequency signals are attenuated while allowing higher frequency signals to pass through with minimal loss.
