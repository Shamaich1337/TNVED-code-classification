The \nBQ769x0  is designed with low power in mind: Sub-\nblocks within the IC may be enabled or disabled to \ncontrol the overall chip current consumption, and a \nSHIP mode provides a simple way to put the pack into \nan ultra-low power state.\nThe BQ76920 device supports up to 5-series cells \nor typical 18-V packs, the BQ76930 handles up \nto 10-series cells or typical 36-V packs, and the \nBQ76940 works for up to 15-series cells or typical \n48-V packs.  A variety of battery chemistries may be \nmanaged with these AFEs, including Li-ion, Li-iron \nphosphate, and more. Through I2C, a host controller \ncan use the BQ769x0  to implement many battery \npack management functions, such as monitoring (cell \nvoltages, pack current, pack temperatures), protection \n(controlling charge/discharge FETs), and balancing. \nIntegrated A/D converters enable a purely digital \nreadout of critical system parameters, with calibration \nhandled in TI’s manufacturing process.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER1PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nBQ76920 TSSOP (20) 6.50 mm × 4.40 mm\nBQ76930 TSSOP (30) 7.80 mm × 4.40 mm\nBQ76940 TSSOP (44) 11.00 mm × 4.40 mm\nRc\nRc\nRc\nRc\nRsnsCc\nCc\nCc\nCcCc\n1000 .1 µF4.7 µFBAT\nVC 5\nVC 4\nVC 3\nVC 2\nVC 1\nVSSSCL\nSDA\nCHG\nDSGREGSRC\nREGOUT\nSRNSRPVC 0CAP 1\nTS 1 Cf\n1000 .1 µF1 µF\nRcRf\n1 M 1 MRc\n10 k\nALERT\n1 MPUSH - BUTTON FOR BOOT\nVCC\nGPIOSDASCL\nVSSCc1 µF\n0 .1 µF10 kΩPACK +\nPACK –Companion\nController\nSimplified SchematicBQ76920 , BQ76930 , BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I  – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Integrated A/D converters enable a purely digital readout of critical system parameters including \ncell voltages and internal or external temperature, with calibration handled in TI’s manufacturing process. For an \nadditional degree of pack reliability, the BQ769x0  includes hardware protections for voltage (OV, UV) and current \n(OCD, SCD).\nThe BQ769x0  provides two low-side FET drivers, charge (CHG) and discharge (DSG), which may be used to \ndirectly manipulate low-side power NCH FETs, or as signals that control an external circuit that enables high-side \nPCH or NCH FETs. A dedicated ALERT input/output pin serves as an interrupt signal to the host microcontroller, \nquickly informing the microcontroller of an updated status in the AFE. This may include a fault event or that a \ncoulomb counter sample is available for reading. An available ALERT pin may also be driven externally by a \nsecondary protector to provide a redundant means of disabling the CHG and DSG signals and higher system \nvisibility.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nBAT\nCHG\nVSSCell Balance\nDrivers/FETs\nEEPROMInternal 3.3 -V\nLDO\nDSG\nSRN SRPSDASCL\nTSREG\nSRC\nREG\nOUTExternal\n2.5/3.3-V LDO\nI2CBandgap\nIBIASVSTUP /POR\n14-bit ADC\nModulator\nV2I\nOCD\ncompDigital core\nBOOTCAP\nTo PORBOOT\n256 kHzALERT\nFET\nDRIVER and\nLOAD\nDETECTCC VREF\n16-bit ACC\nModulatorTSDie tempVCx Inputs\nSCD\ncomp\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedBQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Subsystems\nBQ769x0  consists of three major subsystems: Measurement, Protection, and Control. These work together \nto ensure that the fundamental battery pack parameters—voltage, current and temperature—are accurately \ncaptured and easily available to a host controller, while ensuring a baseline or secondary level of hardware \nprotection in the event that a host controller is unable or unavailable to manage certain fault conditions.\nNote\nThe BQ769x0  is intended to serve as an analog front-end (AFE) as part of a chipset system solution: \nA companion microcontroller is required to oversee and control this AFE.\n•The Measurement subsystem’s core responsibility is to digitize the cell voltages, pack current (integrated into \na passed charge calculation), external thermistor temperature, and internal die temperature. It also performs \nan automatic calculation of the total battery stack voltage, by simply adding up all measured cell voltages.\n•The Protection subsystem provides a baseline or secondary level of hardware protections to better support \na battery pack’s FMEA requirements in the event of a loss of host control or simply if a host is unable to \nrespond to a certain fault event in time. Integrated protections include pack-level faults such as OV, UV, \nOCD, SCD, detection of an external secondary protector fault, and internal logic “watchdog”-style device fault \n(XREADY). Protection events will trigger toggling of the ALERT pin, as well as automatic disabling of the \nDSG or CHG FET driver (depending on the fault). Recovery from a fault event must be handled by the host \nmicrocontroller.\n•The Control subsystem implements a suite of useful pack features, including direct low-side NCH FET \ndrivers, cell balancing drivers, the ALERT digital output, an external LDO and more.\nThe following sections describe each subsystem in greater detail, as well as explaining the various power states \nthat are available.\n8.3.1.1 Measurement Subsystem Overview\nThe monitoring subsystem ensures that all cell voltages, temperatures, and pack current may be easily \nmeasured by the host. All ADCs are trimmed by TI.\nADC and CC data are always returned as atomic values if both high and low registers are read in the same \ntransaction (using address auto-increment).\n8.3.1.1.1 Data Transfer to the Host Controller\nThe BQ769x0  has a fully digital interface: All information is transferred through I2C, simply by reading and/or \nwriting to the appropriate register(s) storing the relevant data. Block reads and writes, buffered by an 8-bit CRC \ncode per byte, ensure a fast and robust transmission of data.\n8.3.1.1.2 14-Bit ADC\nEach BQ769x0  device measures cell voltages and temperatures using a 14-bit ADC. This ADC measures all \ndifferential cell voltages, thermistors and/or die temperature with a nominal full-scale unsigned range of 0–6.275 \nV and LSB of 382 µV.\nTo enable the ADC, the [ADC_EN]  bit in the SYS_CTRL1 register must be set. This bit is set automatically \nwhenever the device enters NORMAL mode. When enabled, the ADC ensures that the integrated OV and UV \nprotections are functional.\nFor each contiguous set of five cells (VC1 to VC5, VC6 to VC10), when no cells in that particular set are being \nbalanced, each cell is measured over a 50-ms decimation window and a complete update is available every 250 \nms. In the BQ76930 and BQ76940, every set of five cells above the primary five cells is measured in parallel. \nThe 50-ms decimation greatly assists with removing the aliasing effects present in a noisy motor environment.\nWhen any cells in a contiguous set of 5 cells are being balanced, those affected cells are measured in a reduced \n12.5-ms decimation period, to allow the cell balancing to function properly without affecting the integrated OV \nand UV protections.

This reduced decimation period is only applied to sets where one of the cells is being balanced. The \nfollowing summarizes this for the BQ76920–BQ76940 devices:\n•VC1 to VC5 measurements are each taken in a 50-ms decimation period when all bits in CELLBAL1 register \nare 0, and a 12.5-ms decimation period when any bits in CELLBAL1 register are 1.\n•VC6 to VC10 measurements are each taken in a 50-ms decimation period when all bits in CELLBAL2 register \nare 0, and a 12.5-ms decimation period when any bits in CELLBAL2 register are 1.\n•VC11 to VC15 measurements are each taken in a 50-ms decimation period when all bits in CELLBAL3 \nregister are 0, and a 12.5-ms decimation period when any bits in CELLBAL3 register are 1.\n•Total update interval is 250 ms.\nEach differential cell input is factory-trimmed for gain or offset, such that the resulting reading through I2C is \nalways consistent from part-to-part and requires no additional calibration or correction factor application.\nThe ADC is required to be enabled in order for the integrated OV and UV protections to be operating.\nThe following shows how to convert the 14-bit ADC reading into an analog voltage. Each device is factory \ncalibrated, with a GAIN and OFFSET stored into EEPROM.\nThe ADC transfer function is a linear equation defined as follows:\nV(cell) = GAIN x ADC(cell) + OFFSET (1)\nGAIN is stored in units of µV/LSB, while OFFSET is stored in mV units.\nSome example cell voltage calculations are provided in the table below. For illustration purposes, the example \nuses a hypothetical GAIN of 380 µV/LSB (ADCGAIN<4:0> = 0x0F) and OFFSET of 30 mV (ADCOFFSET<7:0> \n= 0x1E).\n14-Bit ADC Result ADC Result in Decimal GAIN (µV/LSB) OFFSET (mV) Cell Voltage (mV)\n0x1800 6144 380 30 2365\n0x1F10 7952 380 30 3052\nNote\nWhen entering NORMAL mode from SHIP mode, please allow for the following time s before reading \nout initial cell voltage data:\nBQ76920: 250 ms\nBQ76930: 400 ms\nBQ76940: 800 msBQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\n8.3.1.1.2.1 Optional Real-Time Calibration Using the Host Microcontroller\nThe performance of the cell voltage values measured by the 14-bit ADC has a factory-calibrated accuracy, as \nfollows:\n•+/– 10 mV TYP, +/– 40 mV MIN and MAX from 3.6 to 4.3 V,\n•+/– 15 mV TYP, +/– 40 mV MIN and MAX from 3.2 to 4.6 V, and\n•+/– 50 mV MIN and MAX from 2.0 to 5.0 V\nWhile this is suitable for the majority of pack protection and basic monitoring applications the BQ769x0  AFE \nfamily is intended to support, certain systems may require a higher accuracy performance.\nTo achieve this, use an available ADC channel and general purpose output terminal on the host microcontroller \npaired with the BQ769x0 . A simple external circuit consisting of two precision resistors and a small-signal FET is \nactivated by the host microcontroller to determine the total stack voltage, V STACK . This is then compared against \nthe sum of the individual cell voltages as measured by the internal ADC of the BQ769x0 . The resulting transfer \nfunction coefficient, GAIN 2, is simply applied to each cell voltage ADC value for improved accuracy.\nBattery cell stack\nGen.purpose outputA/D inputHost microcontroller\nFigure 8-1. External Real-Time Calibration Circuit to Host Microcontroller\nThe process is as follows:\n1.Periodically measure V STACK .\na.VSTACK  = V AD × (R1 + R2) / R1\n2.Read out all V CELL ADC readings from the BQ769x0  and apply the standard GAIN and OFFSET values \nstored in the BQ769x0 .\na.V(1) = GAIN x ADC 1 + OFFSET, V(2) = GAIN x ADC 2 + OFFSET, and so on\n3.Sum up all V CELL values, V SUM.\na.VSUM = V(1) + V(2) + V(3) …\n4.Calculate GAIN 2.\na.GAIN 2 = V STACK  / VSUM\nAs a general recommendation, a new GAIN 2 function should be generated when the cell voltages increase or \ndecrease by more than 100 mV. With GAIN 2, each cell voltage calculation becomes:\nV(cell) = GAIN 2 × (GAIN x ADC(cell) + OFFSET) (2)\nFor systems that do not require this additional in-use calibration function, GAIN 2 is simply “1”.www.ti.comBQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\n8.3.1.1.3 16-Bit CC\nA 16-bit integrating ADC, commonly referred to as the coulomb counter (CC), provides measurements of \naccumulated charge across the current sense resistor. The integration period for this reading is 250 ms.\nThe CC may be operated in one of two modes: ALWAYS ON and 1-SHOT.\n•In ALWAYS ON mode, the CC runs at 100%, gathering a fresh reading every 250 ms. The conclusion of each \nreading sets the CC_READY bit, which toggles the ALERT pin high to inform the microcontroller that a new \nreading is available. To enable Always On mode, set [CC_EN]  = 1.\n•In 1-SHOT mode, the CC performs a single 250-ms reading, and similarly sets the CC_READY bit when \ncompleted. This mode is intended for non-gauging usages, where the host simply desires to check the pack \ncurrent.\nTo enable a 1-SHOT reading, ensure [ CC_EN]  = 0 and set [CC_ONESHOT]  = 1.\nThe fullscale range of the CC is ± 270 mV, with a max recommended input range of ± 200 mV, thus yielding an \nLSB of approximately 8.44 µV.\nThe following equation shows how to convert the 16-bit CC reading into an analog voltage if no board-level \ncalibration is performed:\nCC Reading (in µV) = [16-bit 2’s Complement Value] × (8.44 µV/LSB) (3)\n16-Bit CC Result ADC Result in Decimal CC Reading (in µV)\n0x0001 1 8.44\n0x2710 10000 84,400\n0x7D00 32000 270,080\n0x8300 –32000 –270,080\n0xC350 –15536 –131,123.84\n0xFFFF –1 –8.44\n8.3.1.1.4 External Thermistor\nOne (BQ76920), two (BQ76930), or three (BQ76940)  10-kΩ  NTC 103AT thermistors may be measured by \nthe device. These are measured by applying a factory-trimmed internal 10-k pull-up resistance to an internal \nregulator value of nominally 3.3 V, the result of which can be read out from the TSx (TS1, TS2, TS3)  registers.\nTo select thermistor measurement mode, set [TEMP_SEL]  = 1.\nThermistor TS1 is connected between TS1 and VSS; TS2 is connected between TS2 and VC5x (BQ76930 and \nBQ76940 only); and TS3 is connected between TS3 and VC10x (BQ76940 only).  These thermistors may be \nplaced in various areas in the battery pack to measure such things as localized cell temperature, FET heating, \nand so forth.\nThe thermistor impedance may be calculated using the 14-bit ADC reading in the TS1, TS2, and TS3  registers \nand 10-k internal pull-up resistance as follows:\nThe following equations show how to use the 14-bit ADC readings in TS1, TS2, and TS3  to determine the \nresistance of the external 103AT thermistor:\nVTSX = (ADC in Decimal) x 382 µV/LSB (4)\nRTS = (10,000 × VTSX) ÷ (3.3 – VTSX) (5)\nTo convert the thermistor resistance into temperature, please refer to the thermistor component manufacturer’s \ndata sheet.BQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\n8.3.1.1.5 Die Temperature Monitor\nNote\nWhen switching between external and internal temperature monitoring, a 2-s latency may be incurred \ndue to the natural scheduler update interval.\nA die temperature block generates a voltage that is proportional to the die temperature, and provides a way \nof reducing component count if pack thermistors are not used or ensuring that the die power dissipation \nrequirements are observed. The die is measured using the same on-board 14-bit ADC as the cell voltages.\nTo select internal die temperature measurement mode, set [TEMP_SEL]  = 0.\nFor BQ76930 and BQ76940,  multiple die temperature measurements are available. These are stored in TS2 and \nTS3.\nTo convert a DIETEMP reading into temperature, refer to the following equation box. If more accurate \ntemperature readings are needed from DIETEMP, the DIETEMP at room temperature value should be stored \nduring production calibration.\nThe following equation shows how to use the 14-bit ADC readings in TS1, TS2, and TS3 when [TEMPSEL] = 0 \nto determine the internal die temperature:\nV25 = 1.200 V (nominal) (6)\nVTSX = (ADC in Decimal) x 382 µV/LSB (7)\nTEMP DIE = 25° – ((V TSX – V 25) ÷ 0.0042) (8)\n8.3.1.1.6 16-Bit Pack Voltage\nOnce converted to digital form, each cell voltage is added up and the summation result stored in the BAT \nregisters. The sum is divided by 4 so that the result of summing 15 cells fits in the 16-bit value. This 16-bit value \nhas a nominal LSB of 1.532 mV.\nThe following shows how to convert the 16-bit pack voltage ADC reading into an analog voltage. This value also \nuses the GAIN and OFFSET stored into EEPROM.\nThe ADC transfer function is a linear equation defined as follows:\nV(BAT) = 4 × GAIN × ADC(cell) + (#Cells x OFFSET) (9)\nGAIN is stored in units of µV/LSB, while OFFSET is stored in mV units.\n8.3.1.1.7 System Scheduler\nA master scheduler oversees the monitoring intervals, creating a full update every 250 ms. Temperature \nmeasurements are taken every 2 seconds. Pack voltage is calculated every 250 ms. More information on the \nSystem Scheduler can be found in the Embedded Scheduler in Cell Battery Monitor of the BQ769x0  application \nreport.\n8.3.1.2 Protection Subsystem\n8.3.1.2.1 Integrated Hardware Protections\nIntegrated hardware protections are provided as an extra degree of safety and are meant to supplement the \nstandard protection feature set that would be incorporated into the host controller firmware. They should not \nbe used as the sole means of protecting a battery pack, but are useful for FMEA purposes; for example, in \nthe event that a host microcontroller is unable to react to any of the below protection situations. All hardware \nprotection thresholds and delays should be loaded into the AFE by the host microcontroller during system \nstartup. The AFE will also default to predefined threshold and delay settings, in case the host microcontroller is \nunable to or does not wish to program the protection settings.www.ti.comBQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\nOvercurrent in Discharge (OCD) and Short Circuit in Discharge (SCD) are implemented using sampled analog \ncomparators that run at 32 kHz, and that continuously monitor the voltage across (SRP–SRN) while the device is \nin NORMAL mode. Upon detection of a voltage that exceeds the programmed OCD or SCD threshold, a counter \nbegins to count up to a programmed delay setting. If the counter reaches its target value, the SYS_STAT register \nis updated to indicate the fault condition, the FET state(s) are updated as shown in Table 8-1 , and the ALERT pin \nis driven high to interrupt the host.\nThe protection fault threshold and delay settings for OCD and SCD protections are configured through the \nPROTECT1 and PROTECT2 registers. See Section 8.5 for details about supported values.\nOvervoltage (OV) and undervoltage (UV) protections are handled digitally, by comparing the cell voltage \nreadings against the 8-bit programmed thresholds in the OV and UV registers.\nThe OV threshold is stored in the OV_TRIP register and is a direct mapping of 8 bits of the 14-bit ADC reading, \nwith the upper 2 MSB preset to “10” and the lower 4 LSB preset to “1000”. In other words, the corresponding OV \ntrip level is mapped to “10-XXXX-XXXX–1000”. The programmable range of OV thresholds is approximately 3.15 \nto 4.7 V, but this is subject to variation due to the (GAIN, OFFSET) linear equation used to map the ADC values.\nThe UV threshold is stored in the UV_TRIP register and is a direct mapping of 8 bits of the 14-bit ADC reading, \nwith the upper 2 MSB preset to “01” and lower 4 LSB preset to “0000”. In other words, the corresponding UV trip \nlevel is mapped to “01-XXXX-XXXX–0000”. The programmable range of UV thresholds is approximately 1.58 to \n3.1 V, but this is subject to variation due to the (GAIN, OFFSET) linear equation used to map the ADC values.\nProtection Upper 2 MSB Middle 8 Bits Lower 4 LSB\nOV 10 Set in OV_TRIP Register 1000\nUV 01 Set in UV_TRIP Register 0000\nNote\nTo support flexible cell configurations within BQ76920, BQ76930, and BQ76940 , UV is ignored on any \ncells that have a reading under UV MINQUAL . This allows cell pins to be shorted in implementations \nwhere not all cells are needed (for example, 6-series cells using the BQ76930 ).\nDefault protection thresholds and delays are shown in the register description at the end of this data sheet. \nThese are loaded into the digital register (RAM) of the device when the device enters NORMAL mode. These \nRAM values may then be overwritten by the host controller to any other values, which they will retain until a \nPOR event. It is recommended that the host controller reload these values during its standard power-up and/or \nreinitialization sequence.\nTo calculate the correct OV_TRIP and UV_TRIP register values for a device, use the following procedure:\n1.Determine desired OV.\n2.Read out [ADCGAIN]  and [ADCOFFSET]  from their corresponding registers. Note that ADCGAIN is stored in \nunits of µV/LSB, while ADCOFFSET is stored in mV.\n3.Calculate the full 14-bit ADC value needed to meet the desired OV and UV trip thresholds as follows:\na.OV_TRIP_FULL = (OV – ADCOFFSET) ÷ ADCGAIN\nb.UV_TRIP_FULL = (UV – ADCOFFSET) ÷ ADCGAIN\n4.Remove the upper 2 MSB and lower 4 LSB from the full 14-bit value, retaining only the remaining middle 8 \nbits. This can be done by shifting the OV_TRIP_FULL and UV_TRIP_FULL binary values 4 bits to the right \nand removing the upper 2 MSB.\n5.Write OV_TRIP and UV_TRIP to their corresponding registers.\nBoth OV and UV protections require the ADC to be enabled. Ensure that the [ADC_EN]  bit is set to 1 if OV and \nUV protections are needed.BQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\n8.3.1.2.2 Reduced Test Time\nA special debug and test configuration bit is provided in the SYS_CTRL2 register, called [DELAY_DIS] . Setting \n[DELAY_DIS]  bypasses the OV/UV protection fault timers and allows a fault condition to be registered within 200 \nms after application of such a fault condition.\n8.3.1.3 Control Subsystem\n8.3.1.3.1 FET Driving (CHG AND DSG)\nEach BQ769x0  device provides two low-side FET drivers, CHG and DSG, which control NCH power FETs or \nmay be used as a signal to enable various other circuits such as a high-side NCH charge pump circuit.\nBoth DSG and CHG drivers have a fast pull-up to nominally 12 V when enabled. DSG uses a fast pull-down to \nVSS when disabled, while CHG utilizes a high impedance (nominally 1 MΩ) pull-down path when disabled.\nAn additional internal clamp circuit ensures that the CHG pin does not exceed a maximum of 20 V.\nclamps at ~ 18 V, R1 will limit current to approximately \n(V(PACK±) - 18) / R1.DSG  CHG  \n \nQ3 is a low-cost PCH FET and is used to keep CHG away\nfrom any voltages below VSS. When CHG is not being  \npulled high, PACK ±  being pulled below VSS will not be\nseen by CHG as Q2 does not turn on. Q3 also allows R2 to  \nkeep Q1 OFF, since all voltages below this FET can  Q3   "follow" PACK ± as it goes below VSS.\n \n \n \nThis diode allows CHG    \n to pull the Q1 gate high.      R1 drops the voltage when PACK ± is pulled high and R1 limits the current going into the CHG pin.

CHG and DSG FET Circuit\nThe power path for the CHG and DSG pull-up circuit originates from the REGSRC pin, instead of BAT.\nTo enable the CHG fet, set the [CHG_ON] register bit to 1; to disable, set [CHG_ON] = 0. The discharge FET \nmay be similarly controlled through the [DSG_ON] register bit.\nCertain fault conditions or power state transitions will clear the state of the CHG/DSG FET controls. Table 8-1 \nshows what action, if any, to take to [CHG_ON] and [DSG_ON] in response to various system events:\n8.3.1.3.1.1 High-Side FET Driving\nThe BQ769x0 battery monitors provide low-side FET drivers that work well for many systems. For some \nsystems, high-side FETs may also be beneficial. High-side FETs enable continuous communication between \na host controller and the monitor, regardless of whether the FETs are on or off. This allows the controller to read \ncritical pack parameters despite safety faults, enabling the system to access pack conditions before allowing \nnormal operations to resume. The BQ769200  high-side N-channel FET driver can be used with the BQ769x0 \nmonitor in systems where high-side FETs are needed. See Figure 9-4 .\nTable 8-1.

To resume FET operation after a fault \ncondition, the host microcontroller must first clear the corresponding status bit in the SYS_STAT \nregister, which will clear the ALERT pin, and then manually reenable the CHG and/or DSG bit. Certain \nfaults, such as OV or UV, may immediately retoggle if such a condition still persists. Refer to Table 8-3 \nfor details on clearing status bits.\nThere are no conditions under which the BQ769x0  automatically sets either [CHG_ON]  or [DSG_ON]  to 1.\n8.3.1.3.2 Load Detection\nA load detection circuit is present on the CHG pin and activated whenever the CHG FET is disabled ([CHG_ON] \n= 0). This circuit detects if the CHG pin is externally pulled high when the high impedance (approximately 1 M Ω) \npull-down path should actually be holding the CHG pin to VSS, and is useful for determining if the PACK– pin \n(outside of the AFE) is being held at a high voltage—for example, if the load is present while the power FETs are \noff. The state of the load detection circuit is read from the [LOAD_PRESENT]  bit of the SYS_CTRL1 register.\nAfter an OCD or SCD fault has occurred, the DSG FET will be disabled ([DSG_ON] cleared), and the CHG \nFET must similarly be explicitly disabled to activate the load detection circuit. The host microcontroller may \nperiodically poll the [LOAD_PRESENT]  bit to determine the state of the PACK– pin and determine when the load \nis removed ( [LOAD_PRESENT]  = 0).\n8.3.1.3.3 Cell Balancing\nBoth internal and external passive cell balancing options are fully supported by the BQ76920, while external \ncell balancing is recommended for BQ76930 and BQ76940 . It is left to the host controller to determine the \nexact balancing algorithm to be used in any given system. Each BQ769x0  device provides the cell voltages and \nbalancing drivers to enable this. If using the internal cell balance drivers, up to 50 mA may be balanced per cell. \nIf using external cell balancing, much higher balancing currents may be employed.\nTo activate a particular cell balancing channel, simply set the corresponding bit for that cell in the CELLBAL1, \nCELLBAL2, or CELLBAL3 register. For example, VC1–VC0 is enabled by setting [CB1] , while VC12–VC11 is set \nthrough [CB12] .\nMultiple cells may be simultaneously balanced. It is left to the user’s discretion to determine the ideal number \nof cells to concurrently balance. Adjacent cells should not be balanced simultaneously. This may cause \ncell pins to exceed their absolute maximum conditions and is also not recommended for external balancing \nimplementations. Additionally, if internal balancing is used, care should be taken to avoid exceeding package \npower dissipation ratings.\nNote\nThe host controller must ensure that no two adjacent cells are balanced simultaneously within each \nset of the following:\n•VC1–VC5\n•VC6–VC10\n•VC11–VC15\nThe total duty cycle devoted to balancing is approximately 70% per 250 ms. This is because a portion of the 250 \nms is allotted for normal cell voltage measurements through the ADC.BQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\nIf [ADC_EN]  =1, OV and UV protections are not affected by cell balancing, since the cell balancing is temporarily \nsuspended for a small slice of time every 250 ms during which the cell voltage readings are taken. This ensures \nthat the OV and UV protections do not accidentally trigger, or miss an actual OV/UV condition on the cells while \nbalancing is enabled.\nNote\nAll cell balancing control bits in CELLBAL1, CELLBAL2, and CELLBAL3 are automatically cleared \nunder the following events, and must be explicitly rewritten by the host microcontroller following \nclearing of the event:\n•DEVICE_XREADY is set\n•Enters NORMAL mode from SHIP mode\n8.3.1.3.4 Alert\nThe ALERT pin serves as an active high digital interrupt signal that can be connected to a GPIO port of the host \nmicrocontroller. This signal is an OR of all bits in the SYS_STAT register.\nIn order to clear the ALERT signal, the source bit in the SYS_STAT register must first be cleared by writing a “1” \nto that bit. This will cause an automatic clear of the ALERT pin once all bits are cleared.\nThe ALERT pin may also be driven by an external source; for example, the pack may include a secondary \novervoltage protector IC. When the ALERT pin is forced high externally while low, the device will recognize \nthis as an OVRD_ALERT fault and set the [OVRD_ALERT]  bit. This triggers automatic disabling of both CHG \nand DSG FET drivers. The device cannot recognize the ALERT signal input high when it is already forcing the \nALERT signal high from another condition.\nThe ALERT pin has no internal debounce support so care should be taken to protect the pin from noise or other \nparasitic transients.\nNote\nIt is highly recommended to place an external 500 k Ω–1 MΩ  pull-down resistor from ALERT to VSS as \nclose to the IC as possible. Additional recommendations are:\na) To keep all traces between the IC and components connected to the ALERT pin very short.\nb) To include a guard ring around the components connected to the ALERT pin and the pin itself.\n8.3.1.3.5 Output LDO\nAn adjustable output voltage regulator LDO is provided as a simple way to provide power to additional \ncomponents in the battery pack, such as the host microcontroller or LEDs. The LDO is configured in EEPROM \nby TI during the production test process, and can support 2.5-V or 3.3-V options.\nA cascode small-signal FET must be added in the external path between BAT and REGSRC with the BQ76930 \nand BQ76940 . This helps drop most of the power dissipation outside of the package and cuts down on package \npower dissipation.\n8.3.1.4 Communications Subsystem\nThe AFE implements a standard 100-kHz I2C interface and acts as a slave device. The I2C device address is \n7-bits and is factory programmed. Consult the Device Comparison Table ( Section 5) of this data sheet for more \ninformation.\nA write transaction is shown in Figure 8-3 . Block writes are allowed by sending additional data bytes before the \nStop.

I2C Read Without Repeated Start\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nEach BQ769x0  device supports the following modes of operation.\nTable 8-2. Supported Power Modes\nMode Description\nNORMALFully operational state. Both ADC and CC may be on, or disabled by host microcontroller. \nOV and UV protection enabled if ADC is on. OCD and SCD enabled. ADC and CC may \nbe disabled to reduce power consumption, and CC may be operated in a “1-SHOT” mode \nfor flexible power savings.\nSHIPLowest possible power state, intended for pack assembly and/or longterm pack storage. \nMust see a BOOT signal (> 1 V BOOT ) on TS1 pin to boot from SHIP → NORMAL. Note \nthat the device always enters SHIP mode upon POR.\n8.4.1 NORMAL Mode\nNORMAL mode represents the fully operational mode where all blocks are enabled and the device sees its \nhighest current consumption. In this mode, certain blocks/functions may be disabled to save power—these \ninclude the ADC and CC. OV and UV are running continuously as long as the ADC is enabled. The OCD and \nSCD comparators may not be disabled in this mode.\nTransitioning from NORMAL to SHIP mode is also initiated by the host, and requires consecutive writes to two \nbits in the SYS_CTRL1 register.\n8.4.2 SHIP Mode\nSHIP mode is the basic and lowest power mode that BQ769x0  supports. SHIP mode is automatically entered \nduring initial pack assembly and after every POR event. When the device is in NORMAL mode, it may enter \nSHIP by the host controller through a specific sequence of I2C commands.\nIn SHIP mode, only a minimum of blocks is turned on, including the VSTUP power supply and primal boot \ndetector. Waking from SHIP mode to NORMAL mode requires pulling the TS1 pin greater than V BOOT , which \ntriggers the device boot-up sequence.\nTo enter SHIP mode from NORMAL mode, the [SHUT_A]  and [SHUT_B]  bits in the SYS_CTRL1 register must \nbe written with specific patterns across two consecutive writes:\n•Write #1: [SHUT_A]  = 0, [SHUT_B]  = 1\n•Write #2: [SHUT_A]  = 1, [SHUT_B]  = 0\nNote that [SHUT_A]  and [SHUT_B]  should each be in a 0 state prior to executing the shutdown command \nabove. If this specific sequence is entered into the device, the device transitions into SHIP mode. If any other \nsequence is written to the [SHUT_A]  and [SHUT_B]  bits or if either of the two patterns is not correctly entered, \nthe device will not enter SHIP mode.www.ti.comBQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\nCAUTION\nDO NOT OPERATE THE DEVICE BELOW POR. When designing with the BQ76940 , the \nintermediate voltages (BAT–VC10x), (VC10x–VC5x), and (VC5x–VSS) must each never fall below \nVSHUT. When this occurs, a full device reset must be initiated by powering down all three \nintermediate voltages (BAT–VC10x), (VC10x–VC5x), and (VC5x–VSS) below V SHUT and rebooting \nby applying the appropriate V BOOT  signal to the TS1 pin. When designing with the BQ76930, the \nintermediate voltages (BAT–VC5x) and (VC5x–VSS) must each never fall below V SHUT. If this \noccurs, a full device reset must be initiated by powering down both intermediate voltages (BAT–\nVC5x) and (VC5x–VSS) below V SHUT and rebooting by applying the appropriate V BOOT  signal to the \nTS1 pin.\nThe device will also enter SHIP mode during a POR event; however, this is not a recommended method of \nSHIP mode entry. If any of the supply-side voltages fall below V SHUT and then back up above V PORA , the device \ndefaults into the SHIP mode state. This is similar to an initial pack assembly condition. In order to exit SHIP \nmode into NORMAL mode, the device must follow the standard boot sequence by applying a voltage greater \nthan the V BOOT  threshold on the TS1 pin. The BQ769x0 Boot Switch Alternatives Application Report  details \nmultiple methods for generating the needed signal on the TS1 pin.BQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\n8.5 Register Maps\nName Addr D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nSYS_STAT 0x00 CC_READY RSVD DEVICE_\nXREADYOVRD_\nALERTUV OV SCD OCD\nCELLBAL1 0x01 RSVD RSVD RSVD CB<5:1>\nCELLBAL2(1)0x02 RSVD RSVD RSVD CB<10:6>\nCELLBAL3(2)0x03 RSVD RSVD RSVD CB<15:11>\nSYS_CTRL1 0x04 LOAD_\nPRESENTRSVD RSVD ADC_EN TEMP_SEL RSVD SHUT_A SHUT_B\nSYS_CTRL2 0x05 DELAY_DIS CC_EN CC_\nONESHOTRSVD DSG_ON CHG_ON\nPROTECT1 0x06 RSNS RSVD RSVD SCD_DELAY SCD_THRESH\nPROTECT2 0x07 RSVD OCD_DELAY OCD_THRESH\nPROTECT3 0x08 UV_DELAY OV_DELAY RSVD\nOV_TRIP 0x09 OV_THRESH\nUV_TRIP 0x0A UV_THRESH\nCC_CFG 0x0B RSVD RSVD Must be programmed to 0x19\nVC1_HI 0x0C RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC1_LO 0x0D <7:0>\nVC2_HI 0x0E RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC2_LO 0x0F <7:0>\nVC3_HI 0x10 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC3_LO 0x11 <7:0>\nVC4_HI 0x12 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC4_LO 0x13 <7:0>\nVC5_HI 0x14 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC5_LO 0x15 <7:0>\nVC6_HI(1)0x16 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC6_LO(1)0x17 <7:0>\nVC7_HI(1)0x18 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC7_LO(1)0x19 <7:0>\nVC8_HI(1)0x1A RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC8_LO(1)0x1B <7:0>\nVC9_HI(1)0x1C RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC9_LO(1)0x1D <7:0>\nVC10_HI(1)0x1E RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC10_LO(1)0x1F <7:0>\nVC11_HI(2)0x20 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC11_LO(2)0x21 <7:0>\nVC12_HI(2)0x22 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC12_LO(2)0x23 <7:0>\nVC13_HI(2)0x24 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC13_LO(2)0x25 <7:0>\nVC14_HI(2)0x26 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC14_LO(2)0x27 <7:0>\nVC15_HI(2)0x28 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nVC15_LO(2)0x29 <7:0>\nBAT_HI 0x2A <15:8>\nBAT_LO 0x2B <7:0>\nTS1_HI 0x2C RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nTS1_LO 0x2D <7:0>\nTS2_HI(1)0x2E RSVD RSVD <13:8>www.ti.comBQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\nName Addr D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nTS2_LO(1)0x2F <7:0>\nTS3_HI(2)0x30 RSVD RSVD <13:8>\nTS3_LO(2)0x31 <7:0>\nCC_HI 0x32 <15:8>\nCC_LO 0x33 <7:0>\nADCGAIN1 0x50 RSVD ADCGAIN<4:3> RSVD\nADCOFFSET 0x51 ADCOFFSET<7:0>\nADCGAIN2 0x59 ADCGAIN<2:0> RSVD\n(1) These registers are only valid for BQ76930 and BQ76940 .\n(2) These registers are only valid for BQ76940 .\n8.5.1 Register Details\nTable 8-3.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe BQ769x0  family of battery monitoring AFEs enabling cell parametric measurement and protection is a \nvariety of 3-series to 15-series Li-ion/li-polymer battery packs.\nTo evaluate the performance and configurations of the device users need the , BQ76940, BQ76930, and \nBQ76920  Evaluation Software  tool to configure the internal registers for a specific battery pack and application. \nThe Evaluation Software tool is a graphical user-interface tool installed on a PC during development. This can be \nused in conjunction with the BQ76920EVM, BQ76930EVM or BQ76940EVM .\nThe BQ769x0  devices are expected to be implemented in a system with a microcontroller that can perform \nadditional functions based on the data made collected. The BQ78350-R1  is one example of a companion \nto the BQ769x0  family. Additional application information is available in the BQ769x0 Family Top Design \nConsiderations Application Report .\n9.1.1 Device Timing\nThe device timeline accuracy is typically 3.5%. Each five-cell group in the BQ76930 and BQ76940 devices uses \nan independent 250-ms timeline, so voltage and temperature measurements of different groups drift with respect \nto one another.\n9.1.2 Random Cell Connection\nThe device design anticipated transient conditions during cell connection, but that design did not result in \nunique specifications. The large component value ranges used in the application circuits may require special \nconsiderations for random cell connection. See additional information in the BQ769x0 Family Top Design \nConsiderations Application Report .\n9.1.3 Power Pin Diodes\nThe VC5X, VC10X, and BAT pins must have a diode from the top group input to the associated power pin, as \nshown in Figure 9-2  and Figure 9-3 . These diodes limit the excursion of the input voltage above the supply. The \ndiodes should be conventional diodes rather than Schottky type to allow some variation of the supply voltage \nwithout loading the cell input. When needed, two diodes may be used in series.\n9.1.4 Alert Pin\nThe ALERT pin is an input and output. The input is sensitive to noise and may benefit from a RC filter at the \npin to reduce noise at the pin. A maximum 250- μs time constant is suggested to allow the pin to fall when it is \ncleared as an output before it is sampled as an input. 500-k Ω and 470-pF values are commonly recommended. \nGuard traces around the traces may be helpful to avoid crosstalk to the ALERT trace.\n9.1.5 Sense Inputs\nThe SRP input should operate near VSS, so VSS references the battery negative on the battery side of the \nsense resistor near the filter connection for SRP. The SRP and SRN have a common mode range to their supply \nfrom REGOUT and the VSS rail. When moving away from the recommended level due to high current or a buffer \namplifier, the OCD and SCD may still trip, but accuracy could be compromised.\n9.1.6 TSn Pins\nThe TSn pins must connect with a thermistor or resistor to the reference power pin for the associated cell \ngroup, as shown in the applications diagram. A resistor must be connected for normal operation even if external BQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n38 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\ntemperature measurement is not used. When thermistors are removable, they should be substituted with a test \nresistance at board test to prevent XREADY faults during test. The TSn pins should not be pulled below their \nreference power pin or the device may not start properly or the ADC may not operate properly.\nA capacitor across the thermistor is not required but may filter noise picked up by thermistor leads. The \nthermistor is biased 37.5 ms before measurement begins, so a 4.7-nF capacitor, such as is used on the \nevaluation module or smaller, allows many time constants for settling before measurement.\nNote\nThe capacitor across the thermistor does not filter noise that may be picked up by the thermistor leads \nbetween different thermistors on the BQ76930 or BQ76940 devices.\nTS1 is also used to boot the part. A rising edge is required for boot. A high level maintained on TS1 does not \nprevent shutdown or waking the part. A voltage level maintained on the TS1 pin after boot affects the voltage \non the thermistor and the temperature determined by the MCU if external temperature sensing is used in normal \noperation.\n9.1.7 Unused Pins\nPins should be connected to the appropriate circuits, as shown in the simplified diagrams in Typical Application s \nand as described in the Pin Configuration and Functions  section. See Pin Usage  for additional comments.\nTable 9-1. Pin Usage\nPIN NAME RECOMMENDATION\nDSG, CHG DSG and CHG are outputs and may be left unconnected if not used.\nVSS Must be used\nSDA, SCL Must be used\nTSn Must have a thermistor or pull down resistor to the group reference. \nTS1 must have a rising edge to boot the part.\nCAPn A capacitor must be installed.\nREGOUT REGOUT also supplies internal circuits.

BQ769x0 Design Requirements (continued)\nDESIGN PARAMETER EXAMPLE VALUE at T A = 25°C\nSCD Protection Delay Time 100 µs\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nTo begin the design process, there are some key steps required for component selection and protection \nconfiguration.\n9.2.2.1 Step-by-Step Design Procedure\n•Determine the number of series cells.\n–This value depends on the cell chemistry and the load requirements of the system. For example, to \nsupport a minimum battery voltage of 24 V using Li-CO 2 type cells with a cell minimum voltage of 3.0 V, \nthere needs to be at least 8-series cells.\n•Select the correct BQ769x0 device.\n–For 8-series cells, the BQ76930 is needed.\n–For the correct cell connections, see Table 9-3 .\n•Select the correct protection FETs.\n–The BQ76930  uses a low-side drive suitable for N-CH FETs.\n–These FETs should be rated for the maximum:\n•Voltage, which should be approximately 5 V (DC) 10 V (peak) per series cell: for example, 40 V.\n•Current, which should be calculated based on both the maximum DC current and the maximum \ntransient current with some margin: for example, 30 A.\n•Power Dissipation, which can be a factor of the RDS(ON) rating of the FET, the FET package, and the \nPCB design: for example, 5 W, assuming 5 mΩ RDS(ON).\n•Select the correct sense resistor.\n–The resistance value should be selected to maximize the input bandwidth use of the coulomb counter \nrange, CC RANGE , as well as keeping the SCD and OCD thresholds in the available selections, and not \nexceed the absolute maximum ratings. The sense resistance RSNS is the threshold or input voltage \ndivided by the current.\n•Using the normal max discharge current, RSNS = 200 mV / 10.0 A = 20 mΩ maximum.\n•However, considering the maximum SCD threshold of 200 mV and I SCD of 25 A , RSNS = 200 mV / 25 \nA = 8 mΩ maximum.\n•The maximum OCD threshold available is 100 mV, with the maximum current of 15 A, RSNS = 100 \nmV / 15.0 A = 6.7 mΩ maximum.\n–Further tolerance analysis (value tolerance, temperature variation, and so on) and PCB design margin \nshould also be considered, so RSNS of 5 mΩ would be suitable with a 75-ppm temperature coefficient \nand power rating of 5 W.\n–With VSS referenced at the SRP terminal charge current creates a negative voltage on SRN. The 5 mΩ \nwith 3 A charge current is within the absolute maximum range.\n•The BQ76930 is chosen, and so the  REGSRC pin needs to be powered through a source follower circuit \nwhere the FET is used to provide current for REGSRC from the battery positive terminal while reducing the \nvoltage to a suitable value for the IC.\n–The FET also dissipates the power resulting from the load current and dropped voltage external to the IC \nand care should be taken to ensure the correct dissipation ratings are specified by the chosen FET.\n•Configure the Current-based protection settings through PROTECT1 and PROTECT2:\n–Ideal SCD Threshold = 25 A × 5 mΩ = 125 mV.\n•However, the closest options are 111 mV (0x03) and 133 mV (0x04) providing 22.2 A and 26.6 A, \nrespectively. Both options have the RSNS bit = 1.\n•0x03 (22.2 A) will be used in this example.\n–The SCD delay threshold setting for a 100 µs delay is 0x01.\n–Therefore, PROTECT1 should be programmed with 0x8B.\n–Ideal OCD Threshold = 15 A × 5 mΩ = 75 mV.www.ti.comBQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 45\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\n•However, the closest options are 72 mV (0x0A) and 78 mV (0x0B), providing 14.4 A and 15.6 A, \nrespectively. Both options have the RSNS bit = 1.\n•0x0A (14.4A) will be used in this example.\n–The OCD delay threshold setting for a 320-ms delay is 0x05.\n–Therefore, PROTECT2 should be programmed with 0x5B.\nNote\nCare should be taken when determining the setting of OV_TRIP and UV_TRIP as these are ADC \nvalue outputs and correlation to cell voltage also requires consideration of the ADC GAIN and ADC \nOFFSET registers. More specific details can be found in Section 8.3.1.2 .\n•Configure the Voltage-based protection settings through OV_TRIP, UV_TRIP and PROTECT3:\n–The selected OV Threshold is 4.30 V. If ADCOFFSET is 0 and GAIN is 382, the desired threshold is 11257 \nor 0x2BF9.\n•Therefore, OV_TRIP should be programmed with 0xBF.\n–The selected UV Threshold is 2.5 V. If ADCOFFSET is 0 and GAIN is 382, the desired threshold is 6545 \nor 0x1991.\n•Therefore, UV_TRIP should be programmed with 0x99.\n–The selected OV Delay is 2 s and the selected UV Delay is 4 s.\n•Therefore, PROTECT3 should be programmed with 0x50.\n9.2.3 Application Curves\n±0.004±0.0020.0000.0020.0040.0060.0080.0100.0120.0140.0160.0180.020\n2.00 2.30 2.60 2.90 3.20 3.50 3.80 4.10 4.40 4.70 5.00VCx Error (V)\nVCx Input (V)VC1 Error\nVC2 Error\nVC3 Error\nVC4 Error\nVC5 Error\nC001\nFigure 9-5.

These components should be placed as close as to \nthe IC as possible.\nAdditionally, for the BQ76930 and BQ76940 there  are additional requirements to ensure a stable power supply \nto the device. The REGSRC pin is powered through a source follower circuit where the FET is used to provide \ncurrent for REGSRC from the battery positive terminal while reducing the voltage to a suitable value for the IC. \nThe FET also dissipates the power resulting from the load current and dropped voltage external to the IC and \ncare should be taken to ensure the correct dissipation ratings are specified by the chosen FET.\nThe BQ76920 does not use a FET because the battery voltage is within the REGSRC range.\nMore information on this topic is available in the BQ769x0 Family Top Design Considerations Application Report .BQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022 www.ti.com\n46 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nIt is strongly recommended for best measurement performance to keep high current signals from interfering with \nthe measurement system inputs and ground.\nA second key recommendation is to ensure that the BQ769x0  input filtering capacitors and power capacitors are \nconnected to a common ground with as little parasitic resistance between the connections as possible.\n11.2 Layout Example\nFigure 11-1  shows a guideline of how to place key components compared to respective ground zones, based on \nthe BQ76920, BQ76930, and BQ76940 EVMs .\nHigh Current Ground Plane Available AreaLow Current Ground Plane Available Area\nGround\ninterconnect\nBAT-\nBAT+PACK+PACK-\nKey components placed here\nProtection FETs\nSense ResistorKey components placed here\nbq78350\nbq76920/30/40\nMeasurement Filter\nResistors and Capacitors\nRSNS CHG DSGbq769x0 bq78350\nFigure 11-1. System Component Placement Layout vs. Ground Zone Guide\nCAUTION\nCare should be taken when placing key power pin capacitors to minimize PCB trace impedances. \nThese impedances could result in device resets or other unexpected operations when the device is \nat peak power consumption.\nAlthough not shown in the diagrams, this caution also applies to the resistor and capacitor network \nsurrounding the current sense resistor.www.ti.comBQ76920, BQ76930, BQ76940\nSLUSBK2I – OCTOBER 2013 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 47\nProduct Folder Links: BQ76920  BQ76930  BQ76940\nbq76920\nREGSRC\nREGOUTBATTERY–\nSENSE\nRESISTORVSSPCB Trace impedanceVC0VC1Figure 11-2.
