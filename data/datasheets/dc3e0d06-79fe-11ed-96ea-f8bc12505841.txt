The A and B ports \nare designed to track two different  power supply rails, \nVCCA  and V CCB  respectively. Both the V CCA  and \nVCCB  supply rails are configurable from 1.1V to 3.6V. \nThis allows volta ge logic signals on the VCCA  side to \nbe translated into lower, higher or equal  value voltage \nlogic signals on the V CCB  side, and vice -versa.  \nThe translator has integrated 10 kΩ pull-up \nresistors on  the I/O lines. The integrated pull -up \nresistors are used to pull -up the  I/O lines to either V CCA \nor V CCB. The PI4ULS 3V204 is an excellent match  for \nopen -drain applications such as the I2C communication \nbus. \n \n. \n \nPin Configuration  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nCSP-12(Bottom View)  TQFN3.5x3.5 -14(Top View)  TSSOP -14(To p View)  \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll trademarks are property of their respect ive owners.  www.diodes.com     5/25/2017  \n2017-05-0005                                                                                                          PT0511-4 \n2 \nPI4ULS 3V204  \nBlock Diagram  \n \n \nFigure 1:  Block Diagram  \n \n \n \nMaximum Ratings  \n \nStorage Temperature  ................................ ................................ ...................  -65oC to +1 50oC \nDC Supply Voltage port B  ................................ ................................ ..............  -0.3V to +5.5V \nDC Supply Voltage port A  ................................ ................................ ..............  -0.3V to+5.5V \nVi(A) referenced DC Input / Output Voltage ................................ ..............  -0.3V to + 5.5V \nVi(B) reference d DC Input / Output Voltage  ................................ ...............  -0.3V to+5.5V \nEnable Control Pin DC Input Voltage  ................................ ....... -0.3V to+5.5V \nShort circuit duration (I/O to GND)  ................................ ......................  40mA \n \n \nPin Description  \n \nPin No  \nTSSOP  Pin No  \nTQFN  Pin No  \nCSP  Pin Name  Type  Description  \n1 1 B2 VCCA Power  A-port supply voltage.  \n1.1V ≤ VCCA ≤ 3.6 V \n2 2 A3 A1 I/O Input/output A.

The A and B ports are designed to track two different power supply rails, V CCA and V CCB respectively. \nBoth the V CCA and V CCB supply rails are configurable from 1.1 V to 3.6V. This allows voltage logic signals on the V CCA side to be \ntranslated into lower, higher or equal value voltage logic signals on the V CCB side, and vice−versa.  \nThe translator has integrated 10 kΩ pull−up resistors on the I/O lines. The integrated pull−up resistors are used to pull−up the \nI/O lines to either V CCA or V CCB. The PI4U LS3V204 is an excellent match for open−drain applications such as the I2C \ncommunication bus.  \n  \n \nApplication Information  \n \nLevel Translator Architecture  \nThe    PI4ULS 3V204  auto sense  translator  provides  bidirectional  voltage  level  shifting  to transfer  data in multiple \nsupply voltage  systems.  This device has two  supply voltages, VCCA and VCCB, which set the logic levels on  the input \nand output sides of the translator. When used to  transfer data from A port  to B port, input signals  referenced to the \nVCCA supp ly are translated to output signals  with a logic level matched to VCCB. In a similar manner, translation shifts \ninput signals with a logic level  compatible to VCCB to an output signal matched to VCCA. The PI4ULS 3V204  consists of \ntwo bi directional channels  that independently determine the direction of the data flow  without requiring a directional \npin. The one -shot circuits  are  used  to  detect  the  rising  or  falling  input  signals.  In  addition, the one shots decrease \nthe rise and fall time of the  outpu t signal for high -to-low and low -to-high transitions.  Each  input/output  channel has an \ninternal 10 k Ω pull. The magnitude of the pull -up resistors can be reduced by  connecting  external  resistors  in parallel  \nto the internal  10 kΩ resistors.  \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll trademarks are property of their respect ive owners.  www.diodes.com     5/25/2017  \n2017-05-0005                                                                                                          PT0511-4 \n11 \nPI4ULS 3V204  \n \n \nInput Driver Requirements  \nThe rise (t R) and fall (t F) timing parameters of the open  drain  outputs  depend  on the magnitude  of the pull−up  \nresistors.  In -addition,  the propagation  times  (tPD), skew  (tPSKEW ) and maximum data rate depend on the impedance  of \nthe device tha t is connected to the translator. The timing  parameters listed in the data sheet assume that the output  \nimpedance of the drivers connected to the translator is less  than 50 kΩ. \n \nEnable Input (EN)  \nThe PI4ULS 3V204  has an Enable pin (EN) that provides  tri-state operation at the I/O pins. Driving the Enable \npin to a low logic level minimizes the power consumption of  the device and drives the I/O VCCB and I/O VCCA pins to a \nhigh impedance  state.  Normal translation operation occurs  when the EN pin is equal to a logic high signal. The EN \npin is referenced to the V CCA supply and has overvoltage  tolerant  protection.  \n \nPower Supply Guidelines  \nDuring normal operation, supply voltage V CCA can be  greater than, less than or equal to VCCB. The sequencing of  \nthe power suppl ies will not damage the device during the  power up operation.  For optimal performance, 0.01 μF to \n0.1μF decoupling  capacitors should be used on the VCCA and VCCB power supply  pins. Ceramic capacitors are a good \ndesign choice to filter  and  bypass  any  nois e  signals  on  the  voltage  lines  to  the  ground  plane  of  the  PCB.  The  \nnoise  immunity  will  be  maximized by placing the capacitors as close as possible to  the  supply  and  ground  pins,  \nalong  with  minimizing  the  PCB connection traces.  \n \n \n \n \n \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll trademarks are property of their respect ive owners.  www.diodes.com     5/25/2017  \n2017-05-0005                                                                                                          PT0511-4 \n12 \nPI4ULS 3V204  \nMechanical Information  \nTQFN3.5x3.5 -14L \n \n \n \n \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll trademarks are property of their respect ive owners.  www.diodes.com     5/25/2017  \n2017-05-0005                                                                                                          PT0511-4 \n13 \nPI4ULS 3V204  \nMechanical Information  \nCSP1.37x1.87 -12 （GA） \n \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll trademarks are property of their respect ive owners.  www.diodes.com     5/25/2017  \n2017-05-0005                                                                                                          PT0511-4 \n14 \nPI4ULS 3V204  \nMechanical Information  \nCSP1.37x1.87 -12 (GAA)  \n \n \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll trademarks are property of their respect ive owners.  www.diodes.com     5/25/2017  \n2017-05-0005                                                                                                          PT0511-4 \n15 \nPI4ULS 3V204  \nTSSOP -14(L) \n \nOrdering Information  \nPart  No. Package Code  Package  \nPI4ULS 3V204LE L 14-Pin,1 73 mil Wide TSSOP  \nPI4UL S3V204LEX  L 14-Pin,1 73 mil Wide TSSOP , Tape & reel  \nPI4ULS 3V204ZBEX  ZB Lead free and Green 14 -pin TQFN3.5x3.5,  \nTape & Reel  \nPI4ULS 3V204GAEX  GA Lead free and Green 12 -pin CSP1.37x1.87,  \nTape & Reel  \nPI4ULS 3V204GA AEX GAA Lead free and Green 12 -pin CSP1.37x1.8 7, \nTape & Reel  \nNote:  \n\uf06c E = Pb-free and Green  \n\uf06c Adding X Suffix = Tape /Reel \n \n \n \n \n \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll trademarks are property of their respect ive owners.  www.diodes.com     5/25/2017  \n2017-05-0005                                                                                                          PT0511-4 \n16 \nPI4ULS 3V204  \n \n \nIMPORTANT NOTICE  \n \nDIODES INCORPORATED MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARDS TO THIS DOCUMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMI TED \nTO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (AND THEIR EQUIVALENTS UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY \nJURISDICTION).   \nDiodes Incorporated and its subsidiaries reserve the right to make modifications, enhancements, improvements, corrections or other changes w ithout further notice to this document and \nany product described herein.
