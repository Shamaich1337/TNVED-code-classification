The maximum voltage rating of the TBU® \ndevice should never be exceeded. Where necessary, an OVP should be employed to limit the maximum voltage. A cost-effective protection solution combines Bourns\n® TBU® protection \ndevices with a pair of Bourns® MOVs. For bandwidth sensitive \napplications, a Bourns® GDT may be substituted for the MOV.The TBU® device, constructed using MOSFET semiconductor \ntechnology, placed in the system circuit will monitor the current with the MOSFET detection circuit triggering to providean effective barrier behind which sensitive electronics are not exposed to large voltages or currents during surge events. The TBU\n® device operates in approximately 1 μs - once line\ncurrent exceeds the TBU® device’s trigger current Itrigger. \nWhen operated, the TBU® device restricts line current to less \nthan 1 mA typically. When operated, the TBU® device will\nblock all voltages including the surge up to rated limits.\nAfter the surge, the TBU® device resets when the voltage \nacross the TBU® device falls to the V reset level. The TBU® \ndevice will automatically reset on lines which have no DC bias or have DC bias below V\nreset (such as unpowered signal lines). \nIf the line has a normal DC bias above V reset, the voltage\nacross the TBU® device may not fall below V reset after the \nsurge. In such cases, special care needs to be taken to ensure that the TBU\n® device will reset, with software monitoring as one \nmethod used to accomplish this. Bourns applicationengineers can provide further assistance.

TBU-CA Series - TBU® High-Speed Protectors\nProduct Dimensions\nDIMENSIONS: MM\n (INCHES)\nRecommended Pad Layout\nTBU® High-Speed Protectors have a 100 % matte-tin termination \nﬁ nish. For improved thermal dissipation, the recommended layout \nuses PCB copper areas which extend beyond the exposed solder pad. The exposed solder pads should be deﬁ  ned by a solder mask \nwhich matches the pad layout of the TBU\n® device in size and spac-\ning. It is recommended that they should be the same dimension as the TBU\n® pads but if smaller solder pads are used, they should be \ncentered on the TBU® package terminal pads and not more than \n0.10-0.12 mm (0.004-0.005 in.) smaller in overall width or length. Solder pad areas should not be larger than the TBU\n® pad sizes \nto ensure adequate clearance is maintained. The recommended stencil thickness is 0.10-0.12 mm (0.004-0.005 in.) with a stencil opening size 0.025 mm (0.0010 in.) less than the solder pad size. Extended copper areas beyond the solder pad signiﬁ  cantly improve \nthe junction to ambient thermal resistance, resulting in operation at lower junction temperatures with a corresponding beneﬁ  t of reli-\nability. All pads should soldered to the PCB, including pads marked as NC or NU but no electrical connection should be made to these pads. For minimum parasitic capacitance, it is recommended that signal, ground or power signals are not routed beneath any pad.PIN 1 & BACKSIDE CHAMFER4.00 ± 0.10\n(.157 ± .004)\n0.00 - 0.05\n(.000 - .002)6.50 ± 0.10\n(.256 ± .004)0.85 ± 0.05\n(.033 ± .002)0.30\n(.012)\n3.40\n(.134)\n0.30\n(.012)1.85\n(.073)0.70\n(.028)0.70\n(.028) 0.80\n(.031)1.85\n(.073)\nC PIN 10.25\n(.010)\n3 2 1Pad # Pin Out\n1 Line In/Out2N U3 Line Out/InPad Designation\nDark grey areas show added PCB copper area for better \nthermal resistance.\nSpeciﬁ  cations are subject to change without notice.\nCustomers should verify actual device performance in their speciﬁ  c applications.
