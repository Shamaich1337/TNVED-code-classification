This \ntest fixture is designed to evaluate the coupler in the same environment that is recommended for installation. \nEn\nclosed inside the test fixture, is a circuit board that is fabricated using the recommended footprint. The part being \ntested is placed into the test fixture and pressure is applied to the top of the device using a pneumatic piston. A four \nport Vector Netwo\nrk Analyzer is connected to the fixture and is used to measure the S\n-\nparameters of the part. Worst \ncase values for each parameter are found and compared to the specification. These worst case values are reported to \nthe test equipment operator along with a \nPass or Fail flag. See the illustrations below.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10, 20 and 30dB\n \nTest Board\n \nTest Board\n \nIn Fixture\n \nTest Station\n \n \nUSA/Canada:\n \nToll Free:\n \nEurope:\n \n \n(315) 432\n-\n8909\n \n(800) \n411\n-\n6596\n \n+44 2392\n-\n232392\n \nAvailable on Tape and \nReel for Pick and Place \nManufacturing.\n \n \n \n  \n  \nModel \nX3C30\nF1\n-\n2\n0S\n                              \nRev \nE\n \n \nThe effects of the test fixture on the measured data must be minimized in order to accurately determine the \nperformance of the device under test. If the line impedance is anything other than \n50\n\uf057\n \nand/or there is a discontinuity \nat the microstrip to SMA interface, there will be errors in the data for the device under test. The test environment can \nnever be “perfect”, but the procedure used to build and evaluate the test boards (outlined below) d\nemonstrates an \nattempt to minimize the errors associated with testing these devices. The lower the signal level that is being \nmeasured, the more impact the fixture errors will have on the data. Parameters such as Return Loss and \nIsolation/Directivity, whic\nh are specified as low as 27dB and typically measure at much lower levels, will present the \ngreatest measurement challenge.\n \n \nThe test fixture errors introduce an uncertainty to the measured data. Fixture errors can make the performance of the \ndevice under \ntest look better or worse than it actually is. For example, if a device has a known return loss of 30dB and \na discontinuity with a magnitude of \n–\n35dB is introduced into the measurement path, the new measured Return Loss \ndata could read anywhere between \n–\n26\ndB and \n–\n37dB. This same discontinuity could introduce an insertion phase \nerror of up to 1\n\uf0b0\n.\n \n \nThere are different techniques used throughout the industry to minimize the affects of the test fixture on the \nmeasurement data. Anaren uses the following design a\nnd de\n-\nembedding criteria:\n \n \n\uf0b7\n \nTest boards have been designed and parameters specified to provide trace impedances of 50 \n\uf0b1\n1\n\uf057\n. Furthermore, discontinuities at the SMA to microstrip interface are required to be less than \n–\n35dB and insertion phase errors (due to \ndifferences in the connector interface discontinuities \nand the electrical line length) should be less than \n\uf0b1\n0.50\n\uf0b0\n \nfrom the median value of the four \npaths.\n \n \n\uf0b7\n \nA “Thru” circuit board is built. This is a two port, microstrip board that uses the same SMA to \nmicr\nostrip interface and has the same total length (insertion phase) as the actual test board. The \n“Thru” board must meet the same stringent requirements as the test board. The insertion loss \nand insertion phase of the “Thru” board are measured and stored. Thi\ns data is used to \ncompletely de\n-\nembed the device under test from the test fixture. The de\n-\nembedded data is \navailable in S\n-\nparameter form on the Anaren website (www.anaren.com).\n \n \n \nNote\n:  The S\n-\nparameter files that are available on the anaren.com website inc\nlude data for frequencies that are \noutside of the specified band. It is important to note that the test fixture is designed for\n \noptimum performance through \nfrequency band of operation\n. Some degradation in the test fixture performance will occur above this \nfrequency and \nconnector interface discontinuities of \n–\n25dB or more can be expected. This larger discontinuity will affect t\nhe data at \nfrequencies above \nband of operation\n.\n \n \nCircuit Board Layout\n \n \nThe dimensions for the Anaren test board are shown below. The \ntest board is printed on Rog\ners RO4350 material \nthat is 0.020\n” thick.\n \nConsider the case when a different material is used. First, the pad size must remain the same to \naccommodate the part. But, if the material thickness or dielectric constant (or both) cha\nnges, the reactance at the \ninterface to the coupler will also change. Second, the linewidth required for 50\n\uf057\n \nwill be different and this will introduce \na step in the line at the pad where the coupler interfaces with the printed microstrip trace. Both of the\nse conditions will \naffect the performance of the part. \nTo achieve the specified performance, serious attention must be given to the \ndesign and layout of the circuit environment in which this component will be used.\n \n \nIf a different circuit board material is\n \nused, an attempt should be made to achieve the same interface pad reactance \nthat\n \nis present on the Anaren RO4350\n \ntest board. When thinner circuit board material is used, the ground plane will \nbe closer to the pad yielding more capacitance for the same siz\ne interface pad. The same is true if the dielectric \nconstant of the circuit board material is higher than is used on the Anaren test board. In both of these cases, \nnarrowing the line before the interface pad will introduce a series inductance, which, when \nproperly tuned, will \ncompensate for the extra capacitive reactance. If a thicker circuit board or one with a lower dielectric constant is used, \n \n \n \n \n \nAvailable on Tape \nand Reel for Pick and \nPlace Manufacturing.\n \nUSA/Canada:\n \nToll Free:\n \nEurope\n:\n \n(315) 432\n-\n8909\n \n(800) 411\n-\n6596\n \n+44 2392\n-\n232392\n \n  \n  \nModel X\n3\nC\n30\nF1\n-\n20\nS\n   \n                      \nRev \n \nE\n \n \n \n \nthe interface pad will have less capacitive reactance than the Anaren test board. In this case, a wider sectio\nn of line \nbefore the interface pad (or a larger interface pad) will introduce a shunt capacitance and when properly tuned will \nmatch the performance of the Anaren test board.\n \nNotice that the board layout for the 3dB and 5dB couplers is different from that \nof the \n10, 20 and 30dB\n \ncouplers. The \ntest board for the 3dB and 5dB couplers has all four traces interfacing with the coupler at the same an\ngle.

This\n \nvoltage level corresponds to a breakdown resis\ntance capable of handling at \nleast 12dB peaks over average power levels, for very short durations. The breakdown location consistently occurred \nacross the air interface at the coupler contact pads (see illustration below). The breakdown levels at these poi\nnts will \nbe affected by any contamination in the gap area around these pads. These areas must be kept clean for optimum \nperformance.
