The LT8653 S features the second generation \nSilent Switcher architecture to minimize EMI emissions \nwhile delivering high efficiency at high switching \nfrequencies. This includes integration of bypass \ncapacitors to optimize high frequency current loops and \nmake it easy to achieve advertised EMI performance by \neliminating layout sensitivity.\nThe fast, clean, low overshoot switching edges enable \nhigh efficiency operation even at high switching \nfrequencies, leading to a small solution size with wide \ncontrol loop bandwidth for fast transient response. \nBurst Mode operation enables ultralow standby current \nconsumption or forced continuous mode can be used to \ncontrol frequency harmonics across the entire output \nload range. The LT8653 S is a full featured, customizable \nvoltage regulator, but also has several pin strap options \nto select internal 2MHz  switching frequency, internal \ncompensation and internal feedback resistor divider \noptions to create a simple, compact two output voltage \nregulator with only five external\xa0components.\n5V/2A, 3.3V/2A 2MHz Step-Down ConverterEfficiencyAPPLICATIONS nSilent Switcher®2 Architecture:\n nUltralow EMI on Any PCB\n nEliminates PCB Layout Sensitivity\n nInternal Bypass Capacitors Reduce Radiated EMI\n nOptional Spread Spectrum Modulation\n n2A DC from Each Channel Simultaneously\n nUp to 3A on Either Channel\n nUltralow Quiescent Current Burst Mode® Operation:\n n6.2μA I Q Regulating 12V IN to 5V OUT1 and 3.3V OUT2\n nOutput Ripple < 10mV P–P \n nOptional External VC Pin: Fast T ransient Response\n nForced Continuous Mode\n nHigh Efficiency at High Frequency\n n94.1% Efficiency at 1A, 5V OUT from 12V IN at 2MHz\n nPin-Selectable Fixed Output Voltages: 5V, 3.3V, 1.8V\n nFast Minimum Switch-On Time: 30ns\n nWide Input Voltage Range: 3.0V to 42V\n nAdjustable and Synchronizable: 300kHz to 3MHz\n nFixed Output Pin Strap Options\n nInternal 2MHz f SW with Fast Internal Compensation\n nSmall 4mm × 3mm 20-Pin LQFN Package\n nAEC-Q100 Qualified for Automotive Applications\n nGeneral Purpose Step-Down\n nAutomotive and Industrial SuppliesAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. \nVIN = 12V\nfSW = 2MHz\n5VOUT\n3.3V OUT\nLOAD CURRENT (A)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\nEFFICIENCY (%)\n8653S TA01bL T8653S\n8653S TA01aRTVIN\nEN/UV\nSW1\nFB1\nVC1VC2D0\nD1\nSW2\nFB2\nBIAS\nVCCGND SYNC47µF 100µF4.7µF\n2.2µH 2.2µH VOUT1\n5V\n2AVOUT2\n3.3V2AV\nIN\n5.6V TO 42V\nfSW = 2MHz\nLT8653S\n2\nRev.

D1 should be tied \nhigh to V CC, low to GND or left open to select the desired \nFB regulation voltage (see Table\xa01).PG2 (Pin 3): The PG2 pin is the open-drain output of an \ninternal comparator . PG2 remains low until the FB2 pin is within ±7.5% of the final regulation voltage and there are no fault conditions. PG2 is pulled low during V\nIN UVLO, \nVCC UVLO, thermal shutdown or when the EN/UV pin is \nlow.\nPG1 (Pin 4): The PG1 pin is the open-drain output of an \ninternal comparator . PG1 remains low until the FB1 pin is within ±7.5% of the final regulation voltage and there are no fault conditions. PG1 is pulled low during V\nIN UVLO, \nVCC UVLO, thermal shutdown or when the EN/UV pin is \nlow.\nSYNC (Pin 5) : External Clock Synchronization Input. \nGround this pin for low ripple Burst Mode operation at low output loads. Apply a DC voltage of 2.8V  or higher \nor tie to V CC for forced continuous mode with spread \nspectrum modulation. Float the SYNC pin for forced \ncontinuous mode without spread spectrum modulation. \nWhen in forced continuous mode, the I Q will increase \nto several mA. Apply a clock source to the SYNC pin for synchronization to an external frequency. The LT8653 S \nwill be in forced continuous mode when an external fre -\nquency is applied.\nCLKOUT (Pin 6):  In forced continuous mode, the CLKOUT \npin provides a 50% duty cycle square wave 90 degrees out of phase with Channel\xa01. This allows synchronization \nwith other regulators with up to four phases. When an \nexternal clock is applied to the SYNC pin, the CLKOUT pin \nwill output a waveform with the same phase, duty cycle \nand frequency as the SYNC waveform. In Burst Mode \noperation, the CLKOUT pin will be grounded. Float this \npin if the CLKOUT function is not used.SW1 (Pin 7): The SW1 pin is the output of the Channel\xa01 internal power switches. Connect this pin to the induc -\ntor . This node should be kept small on the PCB for good per\nformance.\nSW2 (Pin 8): The SW2 pin is the output of the Channel\xa02 internal power switches. Connect this pin to the induc -\ntor . This node should be kept small on the PCB for good per\nformance.\nVCC (Pin 9):  Internal Regulator Bypass Pin. The inter -\nnal power drivers and control circuits are powered from \nthis voltage. V CC current will be supplied from BIAS if \nVBIAS\xa0>\xa03.1V, otherwise current will be drawn from V IN. \nVoltage on V CC will vary between 2.8V and 3.3V when \nVBIAS is between 3.0V and 3.5V. Do not load the V CC pin \nwith external circuitry.\nBIAS (Pin 10):  The internal regulator will draw current \nfrom BIAS instead of V IN when BIAS is tied to a voltage \nhigher than 3.1V. For output voltages of 3.3V and above \nthis pin should be tied to V OUT. If this pin is tied to a \nsupply other than V OUT, use a 1µF local bypass capacitor \non this pin.\nVC1 (Pin 11):  Channel\xa0 1 Error Amplifier Output and \nSwitching Regulator Compensation Pin. Connect this pin \nto appropriate external components to compensate the \nregulator loop frequency response. Connect this pin to \nVCC to use the default internal compensation. If internal \ncompensation is used, the burst mode quiescent current is only 2.5µA for Channel\xa01. If external compensation is used, the burst mode quiescent current is increased to about 50µA for Channel\xa01.\nFB1 (Pin 12):  The LT8653S regulates the FB1 pin to \n800mV, 1.8V, 3.3V, or 5.0V depending on the state of \nthe D0 and D1 pins. If set to 800mV, connect the feedback \nresistor divider tap to this pin. If set to 1.8V, 3.3V or 5.0V, \nconnect this pin directly to the output.\nLT8653S\n11\nRev.

A SS1 voltage below 0.8V forces the \nLT8653S to regulate the FB1 pin to equal the SS1 pin \nvoltage. When SS1 is above 0.8V, the tracking function \nis disabled and the internal reference resumes control \nof the error amplifier . An internal 2μA  pull-up current \nfrom V CC on this pin allows a capacitor to program out -\nput voltage slew rate. This pin is pulled to ground with a \n360Ω MOSFET during shutdown and fault conditions;  use \na series resistor if driving from a low impedance output. This pin may be left floating if the soft-start feature is not being used.\nSS2 (Pin 14) : Channel\xa02 Output Tracking and Soft-Start \nPin. This pin allows user control of output voltage ramp \nrate during startup. A S S2 voltage below 0.8V  forces the \nLT8653 S to regulate the FB2  pin to equal the S S2 pin \nvoltage. When S S2 is above 0.8V , the tracking function \nis disabled and the internal reference resumes control of \nthe error amplifier. An internal 2μA  pull-up current from \nVCC on this pin allows a capacitor to program output \nvoltage slew rate. This pin is pulled to ground with a \n360Ω  MOSFET during shutdown and fault conditions ; \nuse a series resistor if driving from a low impedance \noutput.

Connect this pin \nto appropriate external components to compensate the \nregulator loop frequency response. Connect this pin to \nVCC to use the default internal compensation. If internal \ncompensation is used, the burst mode quiescent current \nis only 2.5µA for Channel\xa02. If external compensation is used, the burst mode quiescent current is increased to about 50µA for Channel\xa02.\nRT (Pin 17):  A resistor is tied between RT and ground \nto set the switching frequency. The RT pin can be tied to V\nCC to set the switching frequency to 2MHz with a fast \ninternal compensation.\nEN/UV (Pin 18): Both channels of the LT8653S are shut -\ndown when this pin is low and active when this pin is high. \nThe hysteretic threshold voltage is 0.77V going up and \n0.74V going down. Tie to V IN if shutdown feature is not \nused. An external resistor divider from V IN can be used \nto program a V IN threshold below which the LT8653S will \nshut down. Do not float this pin.\nVIN (Pin 19, 20) : The V IN pins supply current to the \nLT8653 S internal circuitry and to the internal top side \npower switch of Channel\xa01 and 2. This pin must be locally \nbypassed. Be sure to place the positive terminal of the input capacitor as close as possible to the V\nIN pin, and \nthe negative capacitor terminal as close as possible to the GND pad.\nGND (Exposed Pad Pin 21): LT8653S System Ground. \nConnect the exposed pad to the system ground and the \nboard ground plane. Place the negative terminal of the \ninput capacitors as close to the GND pad as possible. \nThe exposed pad must be soldered to the PCB in order to lower the thermal resistance.\nLT8653S\n12\nRev.

A For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nForeword\nThe LT8653S is a dual monolithic step-down regula -\ntor . The two channels are the same in terms of current \ncapability and power switch size. The following sections \ndescribe the operation of channel\xa01 and common circuits. \nThey will highlight channel\xa02 differences and interactions \nonly when relevant.\nOperation\nThe LT8653S is a dual monolithic, constant frequency, \npeak current mode step-down DC/DC converter . An oscil -\nlator , with frequency set using a resistor on the RT pin, \nturns on the internal top power switch at the beginning of \neach clock cycle. Current in the inductor then increases \nuntil the top switch current comparator trips and turns off \nthe top power switch. The peak inductor current at which \nthe top switch turns off is controlled by the voltage on \nthe V C node. The error amplifier servos the V C node by \ncomparing the voltage on the V FB pin with an internal 0.8V \nreference. When the load current increases, it causes a \nreduction in the feedback voltage relative to the reference, \nleading the error amplifier to raise the V C voltage until the \naverage inductor current matches the new load current. \nWhen the top power switch turns off, the synchronous \npower switch turns on until the next clock cycle begins or \ninductor current falls to zero when not in forced contin -\nuous mode (FCM). If overload conditions result in more than the bottom NMOS current limit flowing through the bottom switch, the next clock cycle will be delayed until switch current returns to a safe level.\nThe “S” in LT8653S refers to the second generation \nSilent Switcher technology. This technology allows fast switching edges for high efficiency at high switching fre -\nquencies, while simultaneously achieving good EMI/EMC \nperformance. This includes the integration of ceramic \ncapacitors into the package for V IN, VCC, BST1 and BST2 \n(C1–C4 in the block diagram). These caps keep all the fast AC current loops small, which improves EMI/EMC \nperformance. \nIf the EN/UV pin is low, both channels are shut down and \nthe LT8653S draws 1.7µA from the input supply. When the EN/UV pin is above 0.74V, both switching regulators will become active. 6.2μA is supplied by V\nIN to common \nbias circuits for both channels.\nEach channel can independently enter Burst Mode oper -\nation to optimize efficiency at light load. Between bursts, \nall circuitry associated with controlling the output switch \nis shut down, reducing the channel ’s contribution to input \nsupply current. In a typical application, 6.2μA  will be \nconsumed from input supply when regulating one chan -\nnel with no load. Ground the SYNC pin for Burst Mode \no\nperation, float it for forced continuous mode (FCM) or \napply a DC voltage higher than 1.8V  to use FCM with \nspread spectrum modulation (SSM). If a clock is applied \nto the SYNC pin both channels will synchronize to the \nexternal clock frequency and operate in FCM. While in \nFCM, the oscillator operates continuously and rising SW \ntransitions are aligned to the clock. During light loads, \nthe inductor current is allowed to go negative to maintain \nthe programmed switching frequency. Minimum current \nlimits for both power switches are enforced to prevent \nlarge negative inductor current from flowing back to the \ninput. SSM dithers the switching frequency from the pro -\ngrammed value set by the RT pin up to 20% higher than \nthe programmed value to spread out the switching energy \nin the frequency domain. The CLKOUT pin has no output in Burst Mode operation, but outputs a square wave 90 degrees phase shifted from channel\xa01 when in FCM. If a clock is applied to the SYNC pin, the CLKOUT pin has the same phase and duty cycle as the external clock.\nTo improve efficiency across all loads, supply current \nto internal circuitry can be sourced from the BIAS pin \nwhen biased at 3.3V or above. Otherwise, the internal \ncircuitry will draw current exclusively from V IN. The BIAS \nLT8653S\n14\nRev.

Internal compensation can be \nselected by connecting the V C pin to V CC, which simplifies \nthe application circuit. External compensation improves \nthe transient response at the expense of about 50µA  more \nquiescent current per channel.Comparators monitoring the FB pin voltage will pull the \ncorresponding PG pin low if the output voltage varies more than ±7.5% (typical) from the regulation voltage or \nif a fault condition is present.\nT racking soft-start is implemented by providing constant \ncurrent via the SS pin to an external soft-start capacitor \nto generate a voltage ramp. FB voltage is regulated to \nthe voltage at the SS pin until it exceeds 0.8V; FB is then \nregulated to the reference 0.8V. When the SS pin is below \n40mV, the corresponding switching regulator will stop \nswitching. The SS capacitor is reset during shutdown, \nVIN undervoltage, or thermal shutdown.\nBoth channels are designed for output currents up to 3A, \nbut thermal considerations practically limit the output \ncurrents to 2A of continuous current from each channel simultaneously.\nLT8653S\n15\nRev.

The internal feedback resistor divider simplifies the external circuit by eliminating the need for an external feedback resistor divider network. The internal feedback resistor divider is a total of 12MΩ so reduces the no load \nquiescent current of the part beyond what is feasible when \nusing an external resistor divider .\nTable\xa01 shows the regulation voltages for the FB1 and \nFB2 pins for each D0 and D1 configuration.

When configured this way, the \ninternal compensation is adjusted to optimize the tran -\nsient response for 2MHz operation resulting in a faster \ntransient response than when using internal compensa -\ntion with the switching frequency set by an external R T \nresistor . External compensation on the VC node is the \nsame regardless of whether the switching frequency is \nprogrammed with an R T resistor or connecting the RT \npin to V CC.\nOperating Frequency Selection and T rade-Offs\nSelection of the operating frequency is a trade-off between \nefficiency, component size and input voltage range. The advantage of high frequency operation is that smaller \ninductor and capacitor values may be used. The disad -\nvantages are lower efficiency and a smaller input voltage range.\nThe highest switching frequency (f SW(MAX) ) for a given \napplication can be calculated as follows:\n  fSW(MAX)=VOUT+VSW BOT()\ntON MIN( )VIN– VSW TOP()+VSW BOT() ( )\nwhere V IN is the typical input voltage, V OUT is the output \nvoltage, V SW(TOP)  and V SW(BOT)  are the internal switch \ndrops (~ 0.6V, ~0.33V, respectively at maximum load) \nand t ON(MIN)  is the minimum top switch on-time of 30ns \n(see the Electrical Characteristics). This equation shows \nthat a slower switching frequency is necessary to accom -\nmodate a high V IN/VOUT ratio. Choose the switching fre -\nquency based on which channel has the lower frequency constraint.\nFor transient operation, V\nIN may go as high as the abso-\nlute maximum rating of 42V regardless of the R T value, \nhowever the LT8653S will reduce switching frequency \non each channel independently as necessary to maintain \ncontrol of inductor current to assure safe operation.\nIn Burst Mode operation, the LT8653S is capable of a \nmaximum duty cycle of greater than 99%, and the V IN to \nVOUT dropout is limited by the R DS(ON)  of the top switch. \nIn this mode, the channel that enters dropout skips switch \ncycles, resulting in a lower switching frequency. In forced \ncontinuous mode, the LT8653S will not skip cycles to \nachieve a higher duty cycle. The part will maintain the \nprogrammed switching frequency and the dropout voltage \nwill be larger due to the smaller maximum duty cycle.\nLT8653S\n18\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFor applications that cannot allow deviation from the pro -\ngrammed switching frequency at low V IN/VOUT ratios use \nthe following formula to set switching frequency:\n  VIN MIN( )=VOUT+VSW BOT()\n1– fSW• tOFF MIN( )– VSW BOT()+VSW TOP()\nwhere V IN(MIN)  is the minimum input voltage without \nskipped cycles, V OUT is the output voltage, V SW(TOP)  and \nVSW(BOT)  are the internal switch drops (~ 0.6V, ~0.33V, \nrespectively at maximum load), f SW is the switching fre -\nquency (set by RT) and t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum switch \noff-time. Note that higher switching frequency will \nincrease the minimum input voltage below which cycles \nwill be dropped to achieve higher duty cycle.\nInductor Selection and Maximum Output Current\nThe LT8653S is designed to minimize solution size by \nallowing the inductor to be chosen based on the output \nload requirements of the application. During overload or \nshort-circuit conditions, the LT8653S safely tolerates \noperation with a saturated inductor through the use of a high speed peak-current mode architecture.\nA good first choice for the inductor value is:\n  L1 ,2=VOUT1 ,2+VSW(BOT)\nfSW\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency in MHz, V OUT is \nthe output voltage, V SW(BOT)  is the bottom switch drop \n(~0.33V) and L is the inductor value in μH. To avoid over -\nheating and poor efficiency, an inductor must be chosen \nwith an RMS current rating that is greater than the maxi -\nmum expected output load of the application. In addition, the saturation current (typically labeled I\nSAT) rating of the \ninductor must be higher than the load current plus 1/2 of in inductor ripple current:\n  IL PEAK( )=ILOAD MAX( )+1\n2∆IL (1)\nwhere ∆\nIL is the inductor ripple current as calculated in \nEquation 1 and I LOAD(MAX)  is the maximum output load \nfor a given application.As a quick example, an application requiring 1A output \nshould use an inductor with an RMS rating of greater than \n1A and an I SAT of greater than 1.3A. During long duration \noverload or short-circuit conditions, the inductor RMS \nrating requirement must be greater to avoid overheating \nof the inductor . To keep the efficiency high, the series \nresistance (DCR) should be low and the core material \nshould be intended for high frequency applications.\nThe LT8653S limits the peak switch current in order to \nprotect the switches and the system from overload faults. \nThe top switch current limit (I LIM) is at least 6A at low duty \ncycles and decreases linearly to 4A at DC\xa0 =\xa00.8. The induc -\ntor value must then be sufficient to supply the desired \nmaximum output current (I OUT(MAX) ), which is a function \nof the switch current limit (I LIM) and the ripple current.\n  IOUT MAX( )=ILIM–∆IL\n2\nThe peak-to-peak ripple current in the inductor can be \ncalculated as follows:\n ∆IL=VOUT\nL • fSW• 1–VOUT\nVIN MAX( )⎛\n⎝⎜⎜⎞\n⎠⎟⎟\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency of the LT8653S and \nL is the value of the inductor . Therefore, the maximum \noutput current that the LT8653S will deliver depends on \nthe switch current limit, the inductor value and the input and output voltages.\nEach channel has a secondary bottom switch current limit. After the top switch has turned off, the bottom \nswitch carries the inductor current. If for any reason the \ninductor current is too high, the bottom switch will remain \non, delaying the top switch turning on until the inductor current returns to a safe level. This level is specified as \nthe bottom NMOS current limit and is independent of duty \ncycle. Maximum output current in the application circuit is \nlimited to this valley current plus one half of the inductor ripple current.\nIn most cases current limit is enforced by the top switch. \nThe bottom switch limit controls the inductor current \nLT8653S\n19\nRev.

Y5V types have poor \nperformance over temperature and applied voltage and \nshould not be used. A 4.7μF to 10μF ceramic capacitor \nis adequate to bypass the LT8653S and will easily handle \nthe ripple current. Note that larger input capacitance is \nrequired when a lower switching frequency is used. If the \ninput power source has high impedance, or there is sig -\nnificant inductance due to long wires or cables, additional \nbulk capacitance may be necessary. This can be provided with a low performance electrolytic capacitor .\nStep-down regulators draw current from the input sup -\nply in pulses with very fast rise and fall times. The input \ncapacitor is required to reduce the resulting voltage rip -\nple at the LT8653S and to force this very high frequency switching current into a tight local loop, minimizing EMI. T\nypically a 0.1µF capacitor in a small 0402 case size is \nplaced as close as possible to the LT8653S and a larger \nbulk ceramic is added for more capacitance (see the \nPCB Layout section). A second precaution regarding the \nceramic input capacitor concerns the maximum input voltage rating of the LT8653S. A ceramic input capacitor \ncombined with trace or cable inductance forms a high \nquality (under damped) tank circuit. If the LT8653S circuit \nis plugged into a live supply, the input voltage can ring to \ntwice its nominal value, possibly exceeding the LT8653S’s \nvoltage rating. This situation is easily avoided (see Analog \nDevices Application Note 88).\nOutput Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor has two essential functions. Along \nwith the inductor , it filters the square wave generated by \nthe LT8653 S to produce the DC output. In this role it \ndetermines the output ripple, thus low impedance at the \nswitching frequency is important. The second function \nis to store energy in order to satisfy transient loads and stabilize the LT8653S’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors \nhave very low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and \nprovide the best ripple performance. For good starting \nvalues, see the Typical Applications section.\nUse X5R or X7R types. This choice will provide low out -\nput ripple and good transient response. T ransient perfor -\nmance can be improved with a higher value output capac -\nitor and the addition of a feed forward capacitor placed \nbetween V OUT and FB. Increasing the output capacitance \nwill also decrease the output voltage ripple. A lower value of output capacitor can be used to save space and cost but transient performance will suffer and may cause loop instability. See the Typical Applications in this data sheet for suggested capacitor values.\nWhen choosing a capacitor , special attention should be \ngiven to the data sheet to calculate the effective capaci -\ntance under the relevant operating conditions of voltage \nbias and temperature. A physically larger capacitor or one \nwith a higher voltage rating may be required.\nCeramic Capacitors\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However , ceramic capacitors can cause problems \nwhen used with the LT8653S due to their piezoelectric \nnature.

If this is unacceptable, use a high performance \ntantalum or electrolytic capacitor at the output. Low noise \nceramic capacitors are also available.\nTable\xa04.

The rising threshold of the EN/\nUV comparator is 0.74V, with 30mV of hysteresis. The \nEN/UV pin can be tied to V IN if the shutdown feature is \nnot used, or tied to a logic level if shutdown control is \nrequired.\nAdding a resistor divider from V IN to EN/UV programs \nthe LT8653S to operate only when V IN is above a desired \nvoltage (see the Block Diagram). Typically, this thresh -\nold, V IN(EN) , is used in situations where the input supply \nis current limited, or has a relatively high source resis -\ntance. A switching regulator draws constant power from \nthe source, so source current increases as source voltage \ndrops. This looks like a negative resistance load to the \nsource and can cause the source to current limit or latch \nlow under low source voltage conditions. The V IN(EN)  \nthreshold prevents the regulator from operating at source \nvoltages where the problems might occur . This threshold \ncan be adjusted by setting the values R5 and R6 such that \nthey satisfy the following equation:\n VIN EN( )=R5\nR6+1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•0.74V\nwhere the corresponding channel will remain off until \nVIN is above V IN(EN) . Due to the comparator’ s hystere -\nsis, switching will not stop until the input falls slightly \nbelow\xa0V IN(EN) .When operating in Burst Mode operation for light load \ncurrents, the current through the V IN(EN)  resistor network \ncan easily be greater than the supply current consumed \nby the LT8653S. Therefore, the V IN(EN)  resistors should \nbe large to minimize their effect on efficiency at low loads.\nVCC Regulator\nAn internal low dropout (LDO) regulator produces the \n3.4V supply from V IN that powers the drivers and the \ninternal bias circuitry. The internal V CC capacitor is suffi-\ncient for good bypassing, so an external V CC capacitor is \nnot needed. To improve efficiency, the internal LDO can also draw current from the BIAS pin when the BIAS pin is at 3.1V or higher . Typically the BIAS pin can be tied to \nthe lowest output or external supply above 3.1V. If BIAS is \nconnected to a supply other than V OUT, be sure to bypass \nwith a local ceramic capacitor . If the BIAS pin is below \n3.0V, the internal LDO will consume current from V IN.\nApplications with high input voltage and high switching frequency where the internal LDO pulls current from V\nIN \nwill increase die temperature because of the higher power \ndissipation across the LDO. Do not connect an external load to the V\nCC pin.\nFrequency Compensation\nThe LT8653S has VC pins which can be used to optimize \nthe loop compensation of each channel. If the VC pins are \nshorted to V CC, then internal compensation is used. This \nsimplifies the circuit design and minimizes the quiescent \ncurrent, but since the internal compensation has to be \nstable across the 300kHz to 3MHz range of switching \nfrequencies, the internal compensation will not be opti -\nmal, especially at high switching frequencies. If the best \ntransient response is desired, an external compensation network can be connected to the VC pin, which usually consists of a series resistor and capacitor (see R\nC and C C \nin the Block Diagram). \nDesigning the compensation network is a bit complicated \nand the best values depend on the application and in par -\nticular the type of output capacitor . A practical approach is \nto start with one of the circuits in the data sheet that is simi -\nlar to your application and tune the compensation network \nLT8653S\n21\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nto optimize the performance. L Tspice® and L TpowerCAD® \nsimulations can help in this process. Stability should then \nbe checked across all operating conditions, including load \ncurrent, input voltage and temperature. \nThe LT1375  data sheet contains a more thorough discus -\nsion of loop compensation and describes how to test the \nstability using a transient load. \nFigure\xa03 shows an equivalent circuit for the LT8653S \ncontrol loop. The error amplifier is a transconductance \namplifier with finite output impedance. The power section, \nconsisting of the modulator , power switches and inductor , \nis modeled as a transconductance amplifier generating an \noutput current proportional to the voltage at the VC pin. Note that the output capacitor integrates this current and that the capacitor on the VC pin (C\nC) integrates the error \namplifier output current, resulting in two poles in the loop. \nA zero is required and comes from a resistor R C in series \nwith C C. This simple model works well as long as the value \nof the inductor is not too high and the loop crossover \nfrequency is much lower than the switching frequency. A \nphase lead capacitor (C PL) across the feedback divider can \nbe used to improve the transient response and is required \nto cancel the parasitic pole caused by the feedback node to ground capacitance. \nFigure\xa03.

For \noutput tracking applications, SS can be externally driven by another voltage source. From 0V to 0.04V, the SS pin \nwill stop the corresponding channel from switching, thus allowing the SS pin to be used as a shutdown pin. From \n0.04V to 0.8V, the SS voltage will override the internal \n0.8V reference input to the error amplifier , thus regulating \nthe FB pin voltage to that of SS pin (Figure\xa05). When SS is \nabove 0.8V, tracking is disabled and the feedback voltage will regulate to the internal reference voltage. The SS pin \nmay be left floating if the function is not needed. Note \nthat in both Burst Mode operation and forced continuous mode (FCM) the LT8653S will not discharge the output \nto regulate to a lower SS voltage. This is achieved by \ndisabling FCM when the SS voltage is below 1.8V.\nAn active pull-down circuit is connected to the SS pin \nwhich will discharge the external soft-start capacitor in \nthe case of fault conditions and restart the ramp when \nthe faults are cleared. Fault conditions that clear the soft-\nstart capacitor are the EN/UV pin below 0.74V, V IN voltage \nfalling too low or thermal shutdown.\nFigure\xa05.

Otherwise, the internal pull-down device will pull \nthe PG pin low. To prevent glitching both the upper and lower thresholds include 0.25% of hysteresis.\nThe PG pin is also actively pulled low during several fault \nconditions: EN/UV pin below 0.74V, V CC voltage falling too \nlow, V IN under voltage or thermal shutdown.\nSequencing\nStart-up sequencing and tracking can be configured in \nseveral ways with the LT8653S. One channel can be \nrequired to be valid before enabling the other channel to \nsequence their start-up order . This can be done by con -\nnecting the PG pin of the first channel to the SS pin of the second channel. The channels can also be started at the same time where the output voltages can track in a ratiometric fashion (see Figure\xa06).\nParalleling\nTo increase the possible output current, the two channels \ncan be connected in parallel to the same output. To do \nthis the VC, SS and FB pins of each channel are con-\nnected together , while each channel’ s SW node is con-\nnected to the common output through its own inductor . \nFigure\xa07 shows an application where the two channels of \none LT8653S regulator are combined to get one output \ncapable of 4A DC with 6A peak transients. \nLT8653S\n23\nRev.

A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSynchronization\nTo select low ripple Burst Mode operation, tie the SYNC \npin below 0.4V (this can be ground or a logic low out -\nput). To select forced continuous mode (FCM), float the SYNC pin. T\no select FCM with spread spectrum modula -\ntion (SSM), tie the SYNC pin above 2.8V (SYNC can be \ntied to V CC). To synchronize the LT8653S oscillator to \nan external frequency, connect a square wave (with 20% \nto 80% duty cycle) to the SYNC pin. The square wave \namplitude should have valleys that are below 0.4V and \npeaks above 1.5V (up to 6V). When synchronized to an \nexternal clock the LT8653S will use FCM.\nChannel 1 will synchronize its positive switch edge tran -\nsitions to the positive edge of the SYNC signal and chan -\nnel\xa02 will synchronize to the negative edge of the SYNC \nsignal.\nThe LT8653 S may be synchronized over a 300kHz to \n3MHz range. The R T resistor should be chosen to set \nthe LT8653S switching frequency equal to or below the \nlowest synchronization input. For example, if the synchro -\nnization signal will be 500kHz and higher , the R T should \nbe selected for nominal 500kHz.\nThe slope compensation is set by the R T value, while the \nminimum slope compensation required to avoid subhar -\nmonic oscillations is established by the inductor size, \ninput voltage and output voltage. Since the synchroniza-\ntion frequency will not change the slopes of the inductor \ncurrent waveform, if the inductor is large enough to avoid \nsubharmonic oscillations at the frequency set by R T, then \nthe slope compensation will be sufficient for all synchro -\nnization frequencies.\nA synchronizing signal that incorporates spread spectrum \nmay reduce EMI. The duty cycle of the SYNC signal can \nbe used to set the relative phasing of the two channels for minimizing input ripple.Forced Continuous Mode\nForced continuous mode (FCM) is activated by either \nfloating the SYNC pin, tying the SYNC pin to V CC, apply-\ning a DC voltage above 2.8V to the SYNC pin or applying an external clock to the SYNC pin.\nWhile in FCM, discontinuous mode operation is disabled \nand the inductor current is allowed to go negative so that \nthe regulator can switch at the programmed frequency all \nthe way down to zero output current. This has the advan -\ntage of maintaining the programmed switching frequency \nacross the entire load range so that the switch harmonics \nand EMI are consistent and predictable. The disadvantage \nof FCM is that the light load efficiency will be low com -\npared to Burst Mode operation.\nAt low input voltages when the part enters dropout, the \nprogrammed switching frequency will be maintained \nand off time skipping will not be allowed. This keeps the \nswitching frequency controlled, but the dropout voltage will be higher than in burst mode, due to maximum duty cycle constraints.\nThe negative inductor current is limited to a maximum \nof about –2.5A, so the LT8653 S can only sink a maxi -\nmum of about – 1.3A. This prevents boosting an excessive \namount of current back from the output to the input. FCM \nis disabled if the input voltage is greater than 37V  to pre -\nvent overvoltaging the LT8653 S i f the input capacitor is \ncharged when sinking current from the output. Additional \nsafety features include disabling FCM when the SS pin \nvoltage is below 1.8V  to prevent discharging the output \nwhen starting up into a pre-biased output, and a bottom FET current limit to prevent over charging the output if the minimum on time is violated.\nLT8653S\n25\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSpread Spectrum Modulation\nSpread spectrum modulation (SSM) is activated by tying \nthe SYNC pin to V CC or applying a DC voltage above 2.8V \nto the SYNC pin. SSM reduces the EMI/EMC emissions \nby modulating the switching frequency between the value \nprogrammed by RT to approximately 20% higher than \nthat value. The switching frequency is modulated linearly up and then linearly down at a 5kHz rate. This is an ana -\nlog function, so each switching period will be different \nthan the previous one. For example, when the LT8653S is programmed to 2MHz and the SSM feature is enabled, the switching frequency will vary from 2MHz to 2.4MHz at a 5kHz rate. When in SSM, the part will also operate in forced continuous mode.\nClock Output\nThe CLKOUT pin outputs a clock which can be used to syn -\nchronize other regulators to the LT8653 S. In Burst Mode \noperation (SYNC pin low), the CLKOUT pin is grounded. \nIn forced continuous mode (SYNC pin float or DC high), \nthe CLKOUT pin outputs a 50% duty cycle clock where the \nCLKOUT rising edge is approximately 90 degrees phase shifted relative to channel\xa01. If this CLKOUT waveform is \napplied to the SYNC pin of another LT8653 S regulator, \nthen four-phase operation can be achieved. If an external \nclock is applied to the SYNC pin of the LT8653 S, then \nthe CLKOUT pin will output a waveform with the same \nphasing and duty cycle as the SYNC pin clock. The low and high levels of the CLKOUT pin are ground and V\nCC, \nrespectively. The drive strength of the CLKOUT pin is sev -\neral hundred ohms, so the CLKOUT waveform has rise \nand fall times of several tens of ns. The edge rates will be slower if the CLKOUT trace has extra capacitance. Shorted and Reversed Input Protection\nThe LT8653S will tolerate a shorted output. The bottom \nswitch current is monitored such that if inductor current is beyond safe levels, switching of the top switch will be \ndelayed until such time as the inductor current falls to \nsafe levels. Fault condition of one channel will not affect the operation of the other channel, unless the part goes into thermal shutdown.\nThere is another situation to consider in systems where \nthe output will be held high when the input to the LT8653S \nis absent. This may occur in battery charging applications \nor in battery-backup systems where a battery or some \nother supply is ORed with an LT8653S output. If the V IN \npin is allowed to float and the EN/UV pin is held high \n(either by a logic signal or because it is tied to V IN), then \nthe LT8653S’ s internal circuitry will pull its quiescent cur -\nrent through its SW pin. This is acceptable if the system \ncan tolerate current draw in this state. If the EN/UV pin is grounded, the SW pin current will drop to near 1.7µA. However , if the V\nIN pin is grounded while either channel’s \noutput is held high, regardless of EN/UV , parasitic body diodes inside the LT8653S can pull current from the out -\nput through the SW pin and the V\nIN pin, damaging the IC.\nFigure\xa08 shows a connection of the V IN and EN/UV pins \nthat will allow the LT8653S to run only when the input \nvoltage is present and that protects against a shorted or reversed input.\nFigure\xa08.

A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPCB Layout\nFor proper operation and minimum EMI, care must be \ntaken during printed circuit board layout. Figure\xa09 shows \nthe recommended component placement with trace, \nground plane and via locations. Note that large, switched \ncurrents flow in the LT8653 S’s VIN pins, GND pins and the \ninput capacitors. The loop formed by the input capacitor \nshould be as small as possible by placing the capacitor \nadjacent to the V IN and GND pins. When using a physically \nlarge input capacitor , the resulting loop may become too large, in which case using a small case/value capacitor placed close to the V\nIN and GND pins plus a larger capac -\nitor further away is preferred. These components, along with the inductor and output capacitor\n, should be placed \non the same side of the circuit board and their connec -\ntions should be made on that layer . Place a local, unbroken \nground plane under the application circuit on the layer \nclosest to the surface layer . The SW nodes should be as \nsmall as possible. Finally, keep the FB and RT nodes small \nso that the ground traces will shield them from the SW nodes. The exposed pad acts as a heat sink and is con -\nnected electrically to ground. To keep thermal resistance \nlow, extend the ground plane as much as possible and add \nthermal vias under and near the LT8653S to additional \nground planes within the circuit board and on the bottom side. See Figure\xa09 for example PCB layout.\nFigure\xa09. Recommended LayoutCFF1CC1 CC2\nR2\nR1\nL2CFF2\nCVCC\nCOUT1COUT2R4R3R\nC2 RC1\nRT\nCIN\nL1\n8653S F09\n\nLT8653S\n27\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nHigh Temperature Considerations\nCare should be taken in the layout of the PCB to ensure \ngood heat sinking of the LT8653S. The exposed pad on the bottom of the package must be soldered to a ground plane. This ground should be tied to large copper layers \nbelow with thermal vias;  these layers will spread heat \ndissipated by the LT8653 S. Placing additional vias can \nreduce thermal resistance further . The maximum load \ncurrent should be derated as the ambient temperature \napproaches the maximum junction rating. Power dissipa -\ntion within the LT8653S can be estimated by calculating the total power loss from an efficiency measurement and subtracting the inductor loss. The die temperature is cal -\nculated by multiplying the LT8653S power dissipation by the thermal resistance from junction to ambient.\nThe internal thermal shutdown protection of LT8653S will \nstop switching and indicate a fault condition if junction temperature exceeds 165°C. The fault condition will clear and switching resume when the temperature drops back below 160°C.\nTemperature rise of the LT8653S is worst when operating \nat high load, high V IN and high switching frequency. If \nthe case temperature is too high for a given application, then either V\nIN, switching frequency, or load current can \nbe decreased to reduce the temperature to an acceptable \nlevel. Figure\xa010 shows examples case temperature vs V IN, \nswitching frequency and load. \nThe LT8653S’ s internal power switches are capable of \nsafely delivering up to 3A of peak output current. However , \ndue to thermal limits, the package can only handle 3A  \nloads for short periods of time.
