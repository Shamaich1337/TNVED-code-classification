This control method provides stable \noperation without compl ex compensation and even \nwith low ESR ceramic capacitors.  \n \nInternal 20mΩ power and 10mΩ synchronous rectifier \nswitches provide excellent efficiency over a range of \napplications, especially for low output voltages and low \nduty cycles. SY8388A also integrates a bypass switch \nwhich allows the IC to be powered by external DC \nsource. Cycle -by-cycle current limit, input under \nvoltage lock -out, internal soft -start, output under \nvoltage protection and over voltage protection and \nthermal shutdown provide safe operation in all \noperating conditions. The SY8388A is available in a \ncompact  QFN2.5× 2.5 -16 package.  \n \nOrdering Information  \nPackage Code  Temperature Code\nOptional Spec Code□(□□ )□ SY8388\n Features  \n\uf0b7 Low R DS(ON) for Internal Switches ( Top/Bottom): \n20/10  mΩ \n\uf0b7 Wide Input Voltage Range: 4~24V  \n\uf0b7 Integrated Bypass Switch: 1. 5Ω \n\uf0b7 Instant PWM Architecture to Achieve Fast \nTransient Responses  \n\uf0b7 Internal Soft -Start Limits the Inrush Current  \n\uf0b7 Pseudo -Constant Frequency: 600kHz  \n\uf0b7 Adjustable Output Voltage Application  \n\uf0b7 8A Output  Current Capability  \n\uf0b7 ± 1% Internal Reference Voltage  \n\uf0b7 Power Good Indicator  \n\uf0b7 PFM/FCCM Selectable Light Load Operation Mode  \n\uf0b7 Power Good Indicator  \n\uf0b7 Output Discharge Function  \n\uf0b7 Cycle -by-cycle Valley and Peak Current Limit \nProtection  \n\uf0b7 Programmable Valley Current Limit T hreshold \nby ILMT Pin  \n\uf0b7 Hic-cup Mode Output Under Voltage Protection  \n\uf0b7 Auto -recovery Mode Output Over Voltage \nProtection  \n\uf0b7 Auto -recovery Mode Over Temperature Protection  \n\uf0b7 Input UVLO  \n\uf0b7 RoHS Compliant and Halogen Free  \n\uf0b7 Compact Package: QFN2.5× 2.5 -16 \n \nApplications  \n\uf0b7 LCD -TV/Net -TV/3DTV  \n\uf0b7 Set Top Box  \n\uf0b7 Notebook  \n\uf0b7 High Power AP                                       \n \nTypical Applications  \nIN\nGND\nENBS\nLX\nFB\nVCCCOUT=22µF×3L1=1.5µH VOUT=3.3VVIN=4~24V\nON/OFFCIN=10µF\nPG PG (Open Drain Output)\nBYPILMT High/Floating/LowCFF=220pFRFF=1kΩ\nR1=100kΩMODE High/Low\n3.3V External Voltage\n (opt.)CIN=0.1µF\nR2=22.1kΩCBS=0.1µF\nCVCC=2.2µFCBYP=1.0µFSY8388A\n \n0.001 0.01 0.1 1Efficiency vs. Output Current\n(VBYP=3.3V, PFM, L=1.5μH/PCMB104T-1R5MS)Efficiency (%)\nOutput Current (A)86065707580859095100\nVIN=12V, VOUT=3.3V\nVIN=19V, VOUT=3.3VVIN=5V, VOUT=3.3V\nVIN=24V, VOUT=3.3V  \nFigure1.

All Rights Reserved.  \n \nDetailed Desc ription  \nGeneral Features  \nConstant -on-time Architecture   \nFundamental to any constant -on-time (COT) \narchitecture is the one -shot circuit or on -time \ngenerator, which determines how long to turn on the \nhigh-side power switch. Each on -time (t ON) is a \n“fixed” pe riod internally calculated to operate the \nstep down regulator at the desired switching \nfrequency considering the input and output voltage \nration, t ON = (V OUT/VIN)× (1/f SW). For example, \nconsidering that a hypothetical converter targets 3.3V \noutput from a 12 V input at 600kHz, the target on -\ntime is (3.3V/12V)× (1/600kHz) = 458ns. Each t ON \npulse is triggered by the feedback comparator when \nthe output voltage as measured at FB drops below the \ntarget value. After one t ON period, a minimum off -\ntime (t OFF,MIN ) is im posed before any further \nswitching is initiated, even if the output voltage is \nless than the target. This approach avoids the making \nany switching decisions during the noisy periods just \nafter switching events and while the switching node \n(LX) is rapidly r ising or falling.  \n \nIn a COT architecture, there is no fixed clock, so the \nhigh-side power switch can turn on almost \nimmediately after a load transient and subsequent \nswitching pulses can be quickly initiated, ramping the \ninductor current up to meet load re quirements with \nminimal delays. Traditional current mode or voltage \nmode control methods must simultaneously monitor \nthe feedback voltage, current feedback and internal \nramps and compensation signals to determine when \nto turn off the high -side power switch  and turn on the \nlow-side synchronous rectifier. Considering these \nsmall signals in a switching environment are difficult \nto be noise -free after switching large currents, \nmaking those architectures difficult to apply in noisy \nenvironments and at low duty c ycles.  \n \nMinimum Duty Cycle and Maximum Duty Cycle  \nIn the COT architecture, t here is no limitation for \nsmall duty cycle, since at very low duty cycle \noperation, once the on -time is close to the minimum \non time, the switching frequency can be reduced as \nneed ed to always ensure a proper operation.  \n \nThe device can support ~75% maximum duty cycle \noperation under T J=-40℃~125℃ condition.  \n \n \n \n Instant -PWM Operation  \nVREFS\nRQVFBCOUTL1VIN VOUT\ntON\nGeneratorRamp \nGeneratorVRAMP\nPWM\nsignalR1\nR2CIN\n \n \nSilergy’s instant -PWM control method adds several \nproprietary improvemen ts to the traditional COT \narchitecture. Whereas most legacy based on COT \nimplementations require a dedicated connection to \nthe output voltage terminal to calculate the t ON \nduration, instant -PWM control method derives this \nsignal internally.  Another improve ment optimizes \noperation with low ESR ceramic output capacitors. In \nmany applications it is desirable to utilize very low \nESR ceramic output capacitors, but legacy COT \nregulators may become unstable in these cases \nbecause the beneficial ramp signal that re sults from \nthe inductor current flowing into the output capacitor \nmaybe become too small to maintain smooth \noperation. For this reason, instant -PWM synthesizes \na virtual replica  of this signal internally.  This internal \nvirtual ramp and the feedback voltage  are combined \nand compared to the reference voltage. When the sum \nis lower than the reference voltage, the t ON pulse is \ntriggered as long as the minimum t OFF has been \nsatisfied and the inductor current as measured in the \nlow-side synchronous rectifier is l ower than the \nbottom FET current limit. As the t ON pulse is \ntriggered, the low -side synchronous rectifier turns off \nand the high -side power switch turns on. Then the \ninductor current ramps up linearly during the t ON \nperiod. At the conclusion of the t ON period, the high -\nside power switch turns off, the low -side \nsynchronous rectifier turns on and the inductor \ncurrent ramps down linearly. This action also initiates \nthe minimum t OFF timer to ensure sufficient time for \nstabilizing any transient conditions and se ttling the \nfeedback comparator   before the next cycle is \ninitiated. This minimum t OFF is relatively short so that \nduring high speed load transient t ON can be \nretriggered with minimal delay, allowing the inductor \ncurrent to ramp quickly to provide sufficie nt energy \nto the load side.  \n \nIn order to avoid shoot -through, a dead time (t DEAD) is \ngenerated internally between the high -side power \x00S\x00i\x00l\x00e\x00r\x00g\x00y\x00 \x00C\x00o\x00r\x00p\x00.\x00C\x00o\x00n\x00f\x00i\x00d\x00e\x00n\x00t\x00i\x00a\x00l\x00 \x00P\x00r\x00e\x00p\x00a\x00r\x00e\x00d\x00 \x00F\x00o\x00r\x00 \x00J\x00I\x00M\x00M\x00Y\n \nSY8388 A \n \nAN_ SY8388A  Rev. 0.9                Silergy Corp.

Pull MODE pin low for PFM operation, \nand pull this pin high for FCCM operation.  \n \nIf PFM light load operation is selected, under light \nload conditions, typically I OUT < 1/2×ΔI L, the current \nthrough the low -side synchronous rectifier will ramp \nto near zero before the next t ON time. When this \noccurs, the low -side synchronous rectifier turns off, \npreventing recirculation current that can seriously \nreduce efficiency under these light load conditions. \nAs load current is further reduced, and the combined \nfeedback and ramp signals remain much greater than \nthe reference voltage, the instant -PWM control loop \nwill not trigger another t ON until needed, so the \napparent operating sw itching frequency will \ncorrespondingly drop, further enhancing efficiency. \nThe switching frequency can be lower than audible \nfrequency area under deep light load or null load \nconditions. Continuous conduction mode (CCM) \nresumes smoothly as soon as the load  current \nincreases sufficiently for the inductor current to \nremain above zero at the time of the next t ON cycle.  \nThe device enters CCM once the load current \nexceeds the critical level. After that, the switching \nfrequency stays fairly constant over the outp ut \ncurrent range. The critical level of the load current is \ndetermined with  \nOUT L\nOUT_CTL\nSW 1V (1 D) II2 2 f L\uf0b4\uf02d \uf044\uf03d\uf03d\uf0b4\uf0b4\n \n \nIf FCCM  light load operation is selected, under light \nload conditions, the low -side synchronous rectifier \nstill turns on even when the inductor current  crosses \nzero. Current flow will continue until the next t ON \ncycle. The device always operates under continuous \nconditions mode  and keeps fairly constant switching \nfrequency over all the output current range . \n \nInput Under Voltage Lock -out (UVLO)  \nTo prevent  operation before all internal circuitry is \nready and to ensure that the power and synchronous \nrectifier switches can be sufficiently enhanced, the \ninstant -PWM incorporate s one input under -voltage \nlockout protections. The device remains in a low \ncurrent st ate and all switching actions are inhibited \nuntil V IN exceeds their own UVLO (rising) threshold. \nAt that time, if EN is enabled, the device  will start -up \nby initiating a soft -start ramp. If V IN falls below VUVLO less than the input UVLO hysteresis, \nswitchi ng actions will again be suppressed.  \n \nIf the input UVLO threshold is low for some high \ninput UVLO threshold requirement applications, use \nEN to adjust the input UVLO by adopting two \nexternal divided resistors.  \nEN\nGNDRH\nRLVIN IN\n \n \nEnable  Control  \nThe EN input is a high -voltage capable input  with \nlogic -compatible threshold. When EN is driven above \n1V normal device operation will be enabled.

When the output voltage is 9 0% of \nthe reg ulation point , PG becomes  high-impedance  \nafter a delay time  tPG,R. \n \nIf the output is pre -biased to a certain voltage  before \nstart-up, the device  disables the switching of  both the \nhigh-side power switch and the  low-side synchronous \nrectifier  until the  voltage on the internal soft start \ncircuit voltage V SS exceeds the  sensed output voltage \nat the FB node . \n \nOutput Discharge    \nSY83 88A discharges the output voltage when the \nconverter shuts down from V IN or EN, or thermal \nshutdown , so that output voltage can be discharged in \na minimal time, even output load current is zero. The \ndischarge FET in parallel with the low -side \nsynchronous rectifier turns on after the low -side \nsynchronous rectifier turns off when shut down logic \nis triggered. The output discharge curren t is typically \n100mA when  the LX voltage is 5V . Note that the \ndischarge FET is not active beyond these shutdown \nconditions.  \n \nOutput  Power Good Indicator   \nThe buck power good indicator is an open drain \noutput controlled by a window comparator connected \nto the feedback signal. If V FB is greater than V PG,R \nand less than V OVP for at least the power good delay \ntime (low to high) , PG will be high -impedance.  \n \nPG should be connected to VIN or another voltage \nsource through a resistor (e.g.  100kΩ). After the input \nvoltage exceeds its own UVLO (rising) threshold, the  \nPG MOSFET is turned on so that PG is pulled to  \nGND before output voltage is ready. After feedback \nvoltage V FB reaches V PG,R, PG is  pulled high (after  \none delay time  typical 200µ s). When V FB drops to \nVPG,F, or rises to V OVP for one OVP delay time, PG is \npulled low (after  one delay time  typical 3 0µ s). \n \nExternal Bootstrap Capacitor Connection   \nThis device integrates a floating power supply for the \ngate driver that operates the high -side power switch. \nProper o peration requires a 0.1µ F low ESR ceramic \ncapacitor to be connected between BS and LX.

To minimiz e the power consumption under \nlight loads, it is desirable to choose large resistance \nvalues for both R 1 and R 2. A value of between 10kΩ \nand 1MΩ is strongly  recommended for both resistors. \nIf V SET is 3.3V, R 1=100kΩ is chosen, then using \nfollowing equation, R 2 can be calculated to be \n22.1kΩ. \n \n \n \n \nFB\nGNDR1\nR2VOUT\n \n \nInput Capacitor Selection   \nInput filter capacitors are needed to reduce the ripple \nvoltage on the input, to filter the switched current \ndrawn from the input supply and to reduce potential \nEMI. When selecting an input capacitor, be sure to \nselect a voltage rating at least 20% greater than the \nmaximum voltage of the input supply and a \ntemperature rating above the system requirements. \nX5R series ceramic capacitors are most often selected \ndue to their small size, low cost, surge current \ncapability and high RMS current ratings over a wide \ntemperature and voltage range. However, systems \nthat are powered by a wall adapter or other long and \ntherefore inductive cabling may be susceptible to \nsignificant inductive ringing at the input to the \ndevice. In these cases, consider adding some bulk \ncapacitance like electrolytic, tantalum or polymer type capacitors. Using a combination of bulk \ncapacitors (to reduce overshoot or ringing) in parallel \nwith ceramic capacitors (to meet the RMS current \nrequirements) is helpful in these cases.  \n \nConsider the RMS current ratin g of the input \ncapacitor, paralleling additional capacitors if required \nto meet the calculated RMS ripple current,  \nCIN_RMS OUTI =I D 1 D \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d（）\n  \nThe worst -case condition occurs at D  = 0.5, then  \nOUT\nCIN_RMS,MAXII=2\n \nFor simplification, choose an input capacitor with an \nRMS current rating greater than half of the maximum \nload current.  \n \nOn the other hand, the input capacitor value \ndetermines the input voltage ripple of the converter. \nIf there is an input voltage ripple requirement in the \nsystem, choose an  appropriate input capacitor that \nmeets the specification.  \nGiven the very low ESR and ESL of ceramic \ncapacitors, the input voltage ripple can be estimated \nby \nOUT\nCIN_RIPPLE,CAP\nSW INIV = D (1-D)fC\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\n \nThe worst -case condition occurs at D  = 0.5, then  \nOUT\nCIN_RIPPLE,CAP,MAX\nSW INIV=4 f C\uf0b4\uf0b4\n \nThe capacitance value is less important than the RMS \ncurrent rating. In most applications a single 10µ F \nX5R capacitor is sufficient. Take care to locate the \nceramic input capacitor as close to the device IN and \nGND pin as possible.  \n \nInductor Selection   \nThe inductor is necessary to supply constant current \nto the output load while being driven by the switched \ninput voltage.  \n \nInstant -PWM operates well over a wide range of \ninductor values. This flexibility allows for \noptimization to find the best trade -off of efficiency, \ncost and size for a particular application. Selecting a \nlow inductor value will help reduce size and cost and \nenhance transient response, but will increase peak \ninductor ripple current, reducing efficiency and \nincreasing output voltage ripp le. The low DC \nresistance (DCR) of these low value inductors may \nhelp reduce DC losses and increase efficiency. On the \nother hand, higher inductor values tend to have \nhigher DCR and will slow transient response.  \n \n21\nSET0.6VR = R\nV -0.6V\uf0b4\x00S\x00i\x00l\x00e\x00r\x00g\x00y\x00 \x00C\x00o\x00r\x00p\x00.\x00C\x00o\x00n\x00f\x00i\x00d\x00e\x00n\x00t\x00i\x00a\x00l\x00 \x00P\x00r\x00e\x00p\x00a\x00r\x00e\x00d\x00 \x00F\x00o\x00r\x00 \x00J\x00I\x00M\x00M\x00Y\n \nSY8388 A \n \nAN_ SY8388A  Rev. 0.9                Silergy Corp.

Ceramic and \nPOS types are most often selected due to their small \nsize and low cost. Total capacitance is determined by \nthe transient response and output voltage ripple \nrequirements of the system.

Instant -PWM \nresponds quickly to changing load conditions, \nhowever, some considerations must be needed, \nespecially when using small ce ramic capacitors \nwhich have low capacitance at low output voltages \nwhich results in insufficient stored energy for load \ntransient. Output transient undershoot and overshoot \nhave two causes: voltage changes caused by the ESR \nof the output capacitor and volt age changes caused \nby the output capacitance and inductor current slew \nrate. \nESR undershoot or overshoot  may be calculated as \nVESR = ΔIOUT× ESR.

Increase C FF will \nspeed up the load transient response if there is no \nstability issue.  \nL1 VOUT  \nCFFCOUTR1\nR2FBRFF\n(opt.)LX\n Note that when C OUT > 500µ F and minimum load \ncurrent is low, s et feed -forward values as R FF = 1kΩ \nand C FF = 2.2nF to provide sufficient ripple to F B for \nsmall output ripple and good transient behavior.  \n \nThermal Design Considerations   \nMaximum power dissipation depends on the thermal \nresistance of the IC package, the P CB layout, the \nsurrounding airflow, and the difference between the \njunction and ambient temperatures. The maximum \npower dissipation may be calculated by:  \nPD,MAX  = (T J,MAX − TA) / θ JA \nWhere, T J,MAX  is the maximum junction temperature, \nTA is the ambient tempe rature, and θ JA is the junction \nto ambient thermal resistance.  \n \nTo comply with the recommended operating  conditions, \nthe maximum junction temperature is 125℃. The \njunction to ambient thermal resistance θ JA is lay out \ndependent. For the QFN 2.5×2.5-16 package  the \nthermal resistance θ JA is 33 ℃/W when measured on a \nstandard Silergy four -layer thermal test board. These \nstandard thermal test layouts have a very large area \nwith long 2 -oz. copper traces connected to each IC \npin and very large, unbroken 1 -oz. interna l power and \nground planes.  \n \nMeeting the performance of the standard thermal test \nboard in a typical tiny evaluation board area requires \nwide copper traces well -connected to the IC\'s \nbackside pads leading to exposed copper areas on the \ncomponent side of the  board as well as good thermal \nvia from the exposed pad connecting to a wide \nmiddle -layer ground plane and, perhaps, to an \nexposed copper area on the board\'s solder side.  \n \nThe maximum power dissipation at T A=25℃ may be \ncalculated by the following formula:  \nPD,MAX  = (125℃ − 25℃) / ( 33℃/W) = 3W \nThe maximum power dissipation depends on \noperating ambient temperature for fixed T J,MAX  and \nthermal resistance θ JA. Use the derating curve in \nfigure below to calculate th e effect of rising ambient \ntemperature on the maximum power dissipation.  \x00S\x00i\x00l\x00e\x00r\x00g\x00y\x00 \x00C\x00o\x00r\x00p\x00.\x00C\x00o\x00n\x00f\x00i\x00d\x00e\x00n\x00t\x00i\x00a\x00l\x00 \x00P\x00r\x00e\x00p\x00a\x00r\x00e\x00d\x00 \x00F\x00o\x00r\x00 \x00J\x00I\x00M\x00M\x00Y\n \nSY8388 A \n \nAN_ SY8388A  Rev. 0.9                Silergy Corp.

And the input capacitor should be \nconnected to the IN and GND by wide copper plane.  \n \nOutput Capacitors:  Guarantee the C OUT negative \nsides are connected with GND pin by wide copper \ntraces instead of vias, in order to achieve better \naccuracy and stability of output voltage.  \n \nVCC Capacitor: Place the VCC capacitor close to \nVCC using short, direct copper trace to one nearest \ndevice GND pin (pin 14).  \n \nBYP Capacitor: Place the BYP capacitor close to \nBYP using short, direct copper trace to one nearest \ndevice GND pin (pin 14) if bypass function is used.  \n \nFeedback Network: Place the feedback components \n(R1, R 2, R FF and C FF) as close to FB pin as possible. \nAvoid routing the feedback line near LX, BS or oth er high frequency signal as it is noise sensitive. Make \nthe feedback sampling point Kelvin connect with \nCOUT rather than the inductor output terminal.  \n \nLX Connection: Keep LX area small to prevent \nexcessive EMI, while providing wide copper traces to \nminimi ze parasitic resistance and inductance. Wide \nLX copper trace between pin 5 and pin 15, 16 should \nbe adopted to improve efficiency.  \n \nBS Capacitor: Place the BS capacitor on the same \nlayer as the device, keep the BS voltage path (BS, LX \nand C BS) as short as possible.  \n \nControl Signals: It is not recommended to connect \ncontrol signals and IN directly. A resistor in a range \nof 1kΩ to 1MΩ should be used if they are pulled high \nby IN.  \n \nGND Vias: Place adequate number of vias on the \nGND layer around the device  for better thermal \nperformance . The exposed GND pad should be \nconnected by a  larger copper area than its size, place \nfour GND vias on it for heat dissipation.  \n \nPCB Board: A four -layer layout with 2 -oz copper is \nstrongly recommended to achieve better thermal \nperformance. The top layer and bottom layer should \nplace power IN and GND copper plane as wide as \npossible. Middle1 layer should place all GND layer \nfor conducting heat and shielding middle2 layer \nsignal line from top layer crosstalk. Place signal lines \non m iddle2 layer instead of the other layers, so that \nthe other layers’ GND plane not be cut apart by these \nsignal lines.   \n  \x00S\x00i\x00l\x00e\x00r\x00g\x00y\x00 \x00C\x00o\x00r\x00p\x00.\x00C\x00o\x00n\x00f\x00i\x00d\x00e\x00n\x00t\x00i\x00a\x00l\x00 \x00P\x00r\x00e\x00p\x00a\x00r\x00e\x00d\x00 \x00F\x00o\x00r\x00 \x00J\x00I\x00M\x00M\x00Y\n \nSY8388 A \n \nAN_ SY8388A  Rev. 0.9                Silergy Corp.
