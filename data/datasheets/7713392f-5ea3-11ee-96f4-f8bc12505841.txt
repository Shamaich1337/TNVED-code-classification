C | Page 11 of 24 JITTER SPECIFICATIONS  \nThe ADN2816 CDR is designed to achieve the best bit-error-\nrate (BER) performance and to exceed the jitter transfer, \ngeneration, and tolerance specifications proposed for SONET/SDH equipment defined in the Telcordia Technologies \nspecification. \nJitter is the dynamic displacement of digital signal edges from \ntheir long-term average positions, measured in unit intervals \n(UI), where 1 UI = 1 bit period. Jitter on the input data can cause dynamic phase errors on the recovered clock sampling \nedge. Jitter on the recovered clock causes jitter on the \nretimed data. \nThe following sections briefly summarize the specifications of \njitter generation, transfer, and tolerance in accordance with the \nTelcordia document (GR-253-CORE, Issue 3, September 2000) \nfor the optical interface at the equipment level and the \nADN2816 performance with respect to those specifications. \nJitter Generation \nThe jitter generation specification limits the amount of jitter \nthat can be generated by the device with no jitter and wander applied at the input. For SONET devices, the jitter generated \nmust be less than 0.01 UI rms, and must be less than 0.1 UI p-p. \nJitter Transfer \nThe jitter transfer function is the ratio of the jitter on the output \nsignal to the jitter applied on the input signal vs. the frequency. This parameter measures the limited amount of the jitter on an \ninput signal that can be transferred to the output signal (see \nFigure 11). \n04948-0-0150.1\nACCEPTABLE\nRANGE\nfC\nJITTER FREQUENCY (kHz)SLOPE = –20dB/DECADEJITTER GAIN (dB)\n \nFigure 11. Jitter Transfer Curve \nJitter Tolerance \nThe jitter tolerance is defined as the peak-to-peak amplitude of \nthe sinusoidal jitter applied on the input signal, which causes a \n1 dB power penalty. This is a stress test intended to ensure that \nno additional penalty is incurred under the operating \nconditions (see Figure 12). \n04948-0-01615.00\n1.50\n0.15\nf0 f1 f2 f3 f4\nJITTER FREQUENCY (kHz)SLOPE = –20dB/DECADEINPUT JITTER AMPLITUDE (UI p-p)\n \nFigure 12. SONET Jitter Tolerance Mask \n \nADN2816 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 12 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADN2816 is a delay- and phase-locked loop circuit for \nclock recovery and data retiming from an NRZ encoded data \nstream. The phase of the input data signal is tracked by two separate feedback loops that share a common control voltage. A high speed delay-locked loop path uses a voltage controlled phase shifter to track the high frequency components of input \njitter. A separate phase control loop, comprised of the VCO, \ntracks the low frequency components of input jitter. The initial frequency of the VCO is set by yet a third loop, which compares the VCO frequency with the input data frequency and sets the coarse tuning voltage. The jitter tracking phase-locked loop (PLL) controls the VCO by the fine-tuning control. \nThe delay and phase loops together track the phase of the input \ndata signal. For example, when the clock lags input data, the \nphase detector drives the VCO to a higher frequency and \nincreases the delay through the phase shifter; both of these \nactions serve to reduce the phase error between the clock and data. The faster clock picks up phase, while the delayed data loses phase. Because the loop filter is an integrator, the static \nphase error is driven to zero. \nAnother view of the circuit is that the phase shifter implements \nthe zero required for frequency compensation of a second-order \nphase-locked loop, and this zero is placed in the feedback path and, thus, does not appear in the closed-loop transfer function. \nJitter peaking in a conventional second-order phase-locked loop \nis caused by the presence of this zero in the closed-loop transfer function. Because this circuit has no zero in the closed-loop \ntransfer, jitter peaking is minimized. \nThe delay and phase loops together simultaneously provide \nwideband jitter accommodation and narrow-band jitter \nfiltering. The linearized block diagram in Figure 13 shows that the jitter transfer function, Z(s)/X(s), is a second-order low-pass \nproviding excellent filtering. Note that the jitter transfer has no \nzero, unlike an ordinary second-order phase-locked loop. This means that the main PLL has virtually zero jitter peaking (see Figure 14). This makes this circuit ideal for signal regenerator applications where jitter peaking in a cascade of regenerators \ncan contribute to hazardous jitter accumulation. \nThe error transfer, e(s)/X(s), has the same high-pass form as an \nordinary phase-locked loop. This transfer function is free to be \noptimized to give excellent wideband jitter accommodation, \nbecause the jitter transfer function, Z(s)/X(s), provides the \nnarrow-band jitter filtering. \n04948-0-017X(s)\nZ(s)\nRECOVERED\nCLOCKe(s)INPU T\nDATAd/scpsh\no/s\n1/n\nd = PHASE DETECTOR GAI N\no =  VCO GAIN\nc = LOOP INTEGRATO R\npsh = PHASE SHIFTER GAI N\nn = DIVIDE RATI O=1\ncn\ndos2 +n psh\nos+  1Z(s)\nX(s)JITTER TRANSFER FUNCTION\n=s2\ns2d psh\ncs++do\ncne(s)\nX(s)TRACKING ERROR TRANSFER FUNCTION\n \nFigure 13.

ADN2816 Jitter Response vs. Conventional PLL \nThe delay and phase loops contribute to overall jitter accom-\nmodation. At low frequencies of input jitter on the data signal, \nthe integrator in the loop filter provides high gain to track large jitter amplitudes with small phase error. In this case, the VCO is frequency modulated and jitter is tracked as in an ordinary phase-locked loop. The amount of low frequency jitter that can \nbe tracked is a function of the VCO tuning range. A wider \ntuning range gives larger accommodation of low frequency jitter. The internal loop control voltage remains small for small phase errors; therefore, the phase shifter remains close to the center of its range and thus contributes little to the low frequency jitter accommodation. \nData Sheet  ADN2816  \n \nRev. C | Page 13 of 24 At medium jitter frequencies, the gain and tunin g range of the \nVCO are not large enough to track input jitter. In this case, the \nVCO control voltage becomes large and saturates, and the VCO \nfrequency dwells at one extreme of its tuning range or at the \nother. The size of the VCO tuning range, therefore, has only a \nsmall effect on the jitter accommodation. The delay -locked loop \ncontrol voltage is now larger, and therefore  the phase shifter \ntakes on the burden of tracking the input jitter. The phase \nshifter range, in UI, can be seen as a broad plateau on th e jitter \ntolerance curve. The phase shifter has a minimum range of 2 UI at all data rates.  The gain of the loop integrator is small for high jitter frequencies ; therefore,  larger phase differences are needed to \nmake the loop control voltage large  enough t o tune the range of \nthe phase shifter. Large phase errors at high jitter frequencies cannot be tolerated. In this region, the gain of the integrator \ndetermines the jitter accommodation. Because the gain of the \nloop integrator declines linearly with frequen cy, jitter accom -\nmodation is lower with higher jitter frequency. At the highest frequencies, the loop gain is very small, and little tuning of the phase shifter can be expected. In this case, jitter accommodation  is \ndetermined by the eye opening of the inp ut data, the static \nphase error, and the residual loop jitter generation. The jitter accommodation is roughly 0.5 UI in this region. The corner frequency between the declining slope and the flat region is \nthe closed loop bandwidth of the delay -locked loop, which is \nroughly 1.0 MHz at 675 Mb/s.  \n \n \n \nADN2816  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 14 of 24 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nFREQUENCY ACQUISITIO N \nThe ADN2816 acquires frequency from the data over a range of \ndata frequencies from 10 Mb/s to 675 Mb/s. The lock detector \ncircuit compares the frequency of the VCO and  the frequency \nof the incoming data. When these frequencies differ by more \nthan 1000 ppm, LOL is asserted. This initiates a frequency \nacquisition cycle. The VCO frequency is reset to the bottom of \nits range, which is 10 MHz. The frequency detector then com pares this VCO frequency and the incoming data frequency \nand increments the VCO frequency, if necessary. Initially, the VCO frequency is incremented in large steps to aid fast acquisi -\ntion. As the VCO frequency approaches the data frequency, the \nstep size is reduced until the VCO frequency is within 250 ppm \nof the data frequency, at which point LOL is deasserted.  \nOnce LOL is deasserted, the frequency -locked loop is turned \noff. The PLL/DLL pulls in the VCO frequency the rest of the \nway until the VCO frequenc y equals the data frequency.  \nThe frequency loop requires a single external capacitor between CF1 and CF2, Pin 14 and Pin 15. A 0.47 µF ± 20%, X7R ceramic \nchip capacitor with < 10 nA leakage current is recommended. \nLeakage current of the capacitor can be ca lculated by dividing \nthe maximum voltage across the 0.47 µF capacitor, ~3 V , by the \ninsulation resistance of the capacitor. The insulation resistance of the 0.47 µF capacitor should be grea ter than 300 MΩ.  \nINPUT BUFFER  \nThe input buffer has differential inputs (PIN/NIN), which are \ninternally terminated with 50 Ω to an on -chip voltage reference \n(VREF = 2.5 V typically). The minimum differential input level \nrequired to achieve a BER of 10−10 is 200 mV p-p.  \nLOCK DETECTOR OPERAT ION  \nThe lock detector on the ADN2816 has three modes of operation: normal mode, REFCLK mode, and static LOL mode.  \nNormal Mode  \nIn normal mode, the ADN2816 is a continuous rate CDR that \nlocks onto any data rate from 10 Mb /s to 675 Mb/s without the \nuse of a reference clock as an acquisition aid. In this mode, the \nlock detector monitors the frequency difference between the \nVCO and the input data frequency, and deasserts the loss- of-\nlock signal, which appears on Pin 16  (LOL) , when the VCO is \nwithin 250 ppm of the data frequency. This enables the D/PLL, \nwhich pulls the VCO frequency in the remaining amount and acquires phase lock. Once locked, if the input frequency error exceeds 1000 ppm (0.1%), the loss -of-lock signal is reasserted \nand control returns to the frequency loop, which begins a new frequency acquisition starting at the lowest point in the VCO \noperating range, 10 MHz. The LOL pin remains asserted until the VCO locks onto a valid input data stream to within \n250 ppm fr equency error. This hysteresis is shown in Figure 15. \n04948-0-020LOL\n0 –250 250 1000 fVCO ERROR\n(ppm)–10001\n \nFigure 15. Transfer Function of LOL  \nLOL Detector Operation Using a Reference Clock  \nIn REFCLK  mode, a reference clock is used as an acquisition aid \nto lock the ADN2816 VCO. Lock -to-reference mode is enabled \nby setting CTRLA[0] to 1. The user also needs to write to the \nCTRLA[7:6] and CTRLA[5:2] bits to set the reference \nfrequency range and the divide ratio of the data rate with \nrespect to the reference frequency. For more details, see the \nReference Clock (Optional)  section. In this mode, the lock \ndetector monitors the difference in frequency between the divided down VCO and the divided down reference clock. The loss- of-lock si gnal, which appears on Pin 16  (LOL) , is \ndeasserted when the VCO is within 250 ppm of the desired \nfrequency. This enables the D/PLL, which pulls the VCO \nfrequency in the remaining amount with respect to the input data and acquires phase lock. Once locked, i f the input \nfrequency error exceeds 1000 ppm (0.1%), the loss -of-lock \nsignal is reasserted and control returns to the frequency loop, which reacquires with respect to the reference clock. The LOL pin remains asserted until the VCO frequency is within 250 ppm of the desired frequency. This hysteresis is shown in \nFigure 15. \nStatic LOL Mode  \nThe ADN2816 implements a static LOL feature, which indicates \nif a loss- of-lock condition has ever occurred and remains \nasserted, even if the ADN2 816 regains lock, until the static LOL \nbit is manually reset. The I2C register bit, MISC[4], is the static \nLOL bit. If there is ever an occurrence of a loss -of-lock \ncondition, this bit is internally asserted to logic high. The \nMISC[4] bit remains high even  after the ADN2816 has \nreacquired lock to a new data rate. This bit can be reset by writing a 1 followed by 0 to I\n2C Register Bit CTRLB[6]. Once \nreset, the MISC[4] bit remains deasserted until another loss -of-\nlock condition occurs.  \nWriting a 1 to I2C Regis ter Bit CTRLB[7] causes the LOL pin, \nPin 16, to become a static LOL indicator. In this mode, the LOL pin mirrors the contents of the MISC[4] bit and has the function ality described in the previous paragraph.  \nData Sheet  ADN2816  \n \nRev. C | Page 15 of 24 The CTRLB[7] bit defaults to 0. In this mode, the LOL pin \noperates in the normal operating mode, that is, it is asserted \nonly when the ADN2816 is in acquisition mode and deasserts when the ADN2816 has reacquired lock.  \nHARMONIC DETECTOR  \nThe ADN2816 provides a harmonic detector, which detects whether o r not the input data has changed to a lower harmonic \nof the data rate that the VCO is currently locked onto. For example, if the input data instantaneously  changes from OC -12, \n622.08 Mb/s to an OC -3, 155.52 Mb/s bit stream, this could be \nperceived as a val id OC -12 bit stream, because the OC -3 data \npattern is exactly 4× slower than the OC -12 pattern. Therefore , \nif the change in data rate is instantaneous, a 101 pattern at OC -3 \nwould be perceived by the ADN2816 as a 111100001111 pattern at OC -12. If the chang e to a lower harmonic is instantaneous, a \ntypical CDR could remain locked at the higher data rate.  \nThe ADN2816 implements a harmonic detector that automati -\ncally identifies whether or not the input data has switched to a lower harmonic of the data rate tha t the VCO is currently \nlocked onto. When a harmonic is identified, the LOL pin is asserted and a new frequency acquisition is initiated. The ADN2816 automatically locks onto the new data rate, and the \nLOL pin is d easserted.  \nHowever, the harmonic detector d oes not detect higher \nharmonics of the data rate. If the input data rate switches to a \nhigher harmonic of the data rate , then the VCO is currently \nlocked onto, the VCO loses lock, the LOL pin is asserted, and a \nnew frequency acquisition is initiated. The A DN2816 \nautomatically locks onto the new data rate.  \nThe time to detect lock to harmonic is  \n2\n16 × (Td/ρ) \nwhere:  \n1/Td is the new data rate. For example, if the data rate is \nswitched from OC -12 to OC -3, then Td = 1/155.52 MHz.  \nρ is the data transition density. Most coding schemes seek to \nensure that ρ = 0.5, for example, PRBS, 8B/10B.  \nWhen the ADN2816 is pl aced in lock to reference mode, the \nharmonic detector is disabled.  \nSQUELCH MODE  \nTwo SQUELCH  modes are available with the ADN2816. \nSQUELCH  DATAOUT  and CLKOUT mode is selected when \nCTRLC[1] = 0 (default mode). In this mode, when the \nSQUELCH  input, Pin 27, i s driven to a TTL high state, both the \nclock and data outputs are set to the zero state to suppress \ndownstream processing. If the SQUELCH  function is not \nrequired, Pin 27 should be tied to VEE.  SQUELCH  DATAOUT or CLKOUT mode is selected when \nCTRLC[1] is 1 . In this mode, when the SQUELCH  input is \ndriven to a high state, the DATAOUT N/DATAOUTP  pins are \nsquelched. When the SQUELCH  input is driven to a low state, \nthe CLKOUT pins are squelched. This is especially useful in repeater applications, where the recovered clock may not be \nneeded.  \nI2C INTERFACE  \nThe ADN2816 supports a 2- wire, I2C compatible, serial bus \ndriving multiple peripherals. Two inputs, serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCK), carry information between any devices connected to the bus. Each slave  device is recognized by a \nunique address. The ADN2816 has two possible 7 -bit slave \naddresses for both read and write operations. The MSB of the 7-bit slave address is factory programmed to 1. B5 of the slave \naddress is set by Pin 19, SADDR5. Slave  Address  Bits [4:0] are \ndefaulted to all 0s. The slave address consists of the 7 MSBs of \nan 8-bit word. The LSB of the word either sets a read or write \noperation (see Figure 6). Logic 1 corresponds to a read \noperation, while Logic 0 corr esponds to a write operation.  \nTo control the device on the bus, the following protocol must be followed. First, the master initiates a data transfer by establish -\ning a start condition, defined by a high- to-low transition on \nSDA while SCK remains high. This  indicates that an address/  \ndata stream follows. All peripherals respond to the start \ncondition and shift the next eight bits (the 7 -bit address and the \nR/W bit). The bits are transferred from MSB to LSB. The \nperipheral that recognizes the transmitted addr ess responds by \npulling the data line low during the ninth clock pulse. This is \nknown as an acknowledge bit. All other devices withdraw from the bus at this point and maintain an idle condition. The idle \ncondition is where the device monitors the SDA and S CK lines \nwaiting for the start condition and correct transmitted address. \nThe R/W bit determines the direction of the data. Logic 0 on the \nLSB of the first byte means that the master writes inform ation to \nthe peripheral. Logic 1 on the LSB of the first byt e means that \nthe master reads information from the peripheral.  \nThe ADN2816 acts as a standard slave device on the bus. The \ndata on the SDA pin is eight  bits long , supporting the 7 -bit \naddresses , plus the R/W bit. The ADN2816 has eight  subaddresses \nto enabl e the user -accessible internal registers (see Table 6 \nthrough Table 10). It, therefore, interprets the first byte as the \ndevice address and the second byte as the starting subaddress. \nAutoincrement mod e is supported, allowing data to be read \nfrom or written to the starting subaddress and each subsequent \naddress without manually addressing the subsequent \nsubaddress. A data transfer is always terminated by a stop condition. The user can also access any un ique subaddress \nregister on a one -by-one basis without updating all registers. \n \nADN2816 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 16 of 24 Stop and start conditions can be detected at any stage of the \ndata transfer. If these conditions are asserted out of sequence \nwith normal read and write operations, they cause an immediate jump to the idle condition. During a given SCK high \nperiod, the user should issue one start condition, one stop \ncondition, or a single stop condition followed by a single start condition. If an invalid subaddress is issued by the user, the ADN2816 does not issue an acknowledge and returns to the idle condition. If the user exceeds the highest subaddress while \nreading back in autoincrement mode, then the highest subad-\ndress register contents continue to be output until the master device issues a no-acknowledge. This indicates the end of a read. In a no-acknowledge condition, the SDATA line is not pulled low on the ninth pulse. See Figure 7 and Figure 8 for sample read and write data transfers and Figure 9 for a more detailed timing diagram. \nREFERENCE CLOCK (OPTIONAL) \nA reference clock is not required to perform clock and data \nrecovery with the ADN2816. However, support for an optional \nreference clock is provided. The reference clock can be driven differentially or single-ended. If the reference clock is not being used, then REFCLKP should be tied to VCC, and REFCLKN can be left floating or tied to VEE (the inputs are internally \nterminated to VCC/2). See Figure 16 through Figure 18 for \nsample configurations. \nThe REFCLK input buffer accepts any differential signal with a \npeak-to-peak differential amplitude of greater than 100 mV (for \nexample, LVPECL or LVDS) or a standard single-ended low \nvoltage TTL input, providing maximum system flexibility. Phase noise and duty cycle of the reference clock are not critical \nand 100 ppm accuracy is sufficient. \n04948-0-021100k\uf057\nVCC/2100k\uf057ADN2816\nREFCLKP\n10\n11\nREFCLKNBUFFER\n \nFigure 16.

No REFC LK Configuration \nThe two uses of the reference clock  are mutually exclusive. The \nreference clock can be used either as an acquisition aid for the \nADN2816 to lock onto data or to measure the frequency of the \nincoming data to within 0.01%. (There is the capability to measure the data rate to approximately ±10% without the use of a reference clock.) The modes are mutually exclusive because, in the first use, the user knows exactly what the data rate is and \nwants to force the part to lock onto only that data rate; in the \nsecond use, the user does not know what the data rate is and \nwants to measure it. \nLock-to-reference mode is enabled by writing a 1 to I\n2C Register \nBit CTRLA[0]. Fine data rate readback mode is enabled by \nwriting a 1 to I2C Register Bit CTRLA[1]. Writing a 1 to both of \nthese bits at the same time causes an indeterminate state and is \nnot supported. \nUsing the Reference Clock to Lock onto Data \nIn this mode, the ADN2816 locks onto a frequency derived \nfrom the reference clock according to \nData Rate /2CTRLA[5:2] = REFCLK /2CTRLA[7:6] \nThe user must know exactly what the data rate is and provide a \nreference clock that is a function of this rate. The ADN2816 can \nstill be used as a continuous rate device in this configuration, provided that the user has the ability to provide a reference clock that has a variable frequency (see Application Note \nAN-632).  \nThe reference clock can be anywhere between 10 MHz and \n160 MHz. By default, the ADN2816 expects a reference clock of \nbetween 10 MHz and 20 MHz. If it is between 20 MHz and 40 MHz, 40 MHz and 80 MHz, or 80 MHz and 160 MHz, the \nuser needs to configure the ADN2816 to use the correct \nreference frequency range by setting two bits of the CTRLA \nregister, CTRLA[7:6]. \nTable 11. CTRLA Settings \nCTRLA[7:6] Range (MHz) CTRLA[5:2] Ratio \n00 10 to 20  0000 1 \n01 20 to 40 0001 2 \n10 40 to 80 n 2n \n11 80 to 160  1000 256 \n \nData Sheet  ADN2816  \n \nRev. C | Page 17 of 24 The user can speci fy a fixed integer multiple of the reference \nclock to lock onto using CTRLA[5:2], where CTRLA should be \nset to the data rate/DIV_F REF, where DIV_F REF represents the \ndivided- down reference referred to the 10 MHz to 20 MHz \nband. For example, if the reference clock frequency i s \n38.88 MHz and the input data rate i s 622.08 Mb/s, then \nCTRLA[7:6] is set to [01] to give a divided -down reference \nclock of 19.44 MHz. CTRLA[5:2] is  set to [0101], that is, 5, \nbecause  \n622.08 Mb/s/19.44 MHz = 25 \nIn this mode, if the ADN2 816 loses lock for any reason, it \nrelocks onto the reference clock and continues to output a stable clock.  \nWhile the ADN2816 is operating in lock- to-reference mode, if \nthe user ever changes the reference frequency, the F\nREF range \n(CTRLA[7:6]) or the F REF ratio (CTRLA[5:2]), this must be \nfollowed by writing a 0 to 1 transition into the CTRLA[0] bit to \ninitiate a new lock -to-reference command.  \nUsing the Reference Clock to Measure Data Frequency  \nThe user can also provide a reference clock to measure the \nrecove red data frequency. In this case, the user provides a \nreference clock, and the ADN2816 compares the frequency of the incoming data to the incoming reference clock and returns a \nratio of the two frequencies to 0.01% (100 ppm). The accuracy \nerror of the refe rence clock is added to the accuracy of the \nADN2816 data rate measurement. For example, if a 100 ppm \naccuracy reference clock is used, the total accuracy of the \nmeasurement is within 200 ppm.  \nThe reference clock can range from 10 MHz and 160 MHz. The \nADN28 16 expects a reference clock between 10 MHz and \n20 MHz by default. If it is between 20 MHz and 40 MHz, \n40 MHz and 80 MHz, or 80 MHz and 160 MHz, the user needs \nto configure the ADN2816 to use the correct reference \nfrequency range by setting two bits of the  CTRLA register, \nCTRLA[7:6]. Using the reference clock to determine the \nfrequency of the incoming data does not affect the manner in \nwhich the part locks onto data. In this mode, the reference clock \nis used only to determine the frequency of the data. For this \nreason, the user does not need to know the data rate to use the reference clock in this manner.  Prior to reading back the data rate using the reference clock, the CTRLA[7:6] bits must be set to the appropriate frequency range with respect to the refe rence clock being used. A fine data rate \nreadback is then executed as follows:  \n1. Write a 1 to CTRLA[1]. This enables the fine data rate measurement capability of the ADN2816. This bit is level sensitive and does not need to be reset to perform subsequent \nfrequency measurements.  \n2. Reset MISC[2] by writing a 1 followed by a 0 to CTRLB[3]. \nThis initiates a new data rate measurement.  \n3. Read back MISC[2]. If it is 0, the measurement is not \ncomplete. If it is 1, the measurement is complete and the data rate can be read  back on FREQ[22:0]. The time for a data rate \nmeasurement is typically 80 ms.  \n4. Read back the data rate from R egisters FREQ2[6:0], \nFREQ1[7:0], and FREQ0[7:0].  \nThe data rate  can be determined by  \n[]( )) _ (/ ..RATE SEL\nREFCLK DATARATE f FREQ f+× =142 022  \nwhere:  \nFREQ[22:0] is the reading from FR EQ2[6:0] MSByte, \nFREQ1[7:0], and FREQ0[7:0] LSByte.  \nfDATAR ATE  is the data rate (Mb/s).  \nfREFCLK  is the REFCLK frequency (MHz).  \nSEL_R ATE  is the setting from CTRLA[7:6].  \nFor example, if the reference clock frequency is 32 MHz, \nSEL_RATE = 1, since the CTRLA[7: 6] setting is  [01], because \nthe reference frequency falls into the 20 MHz to 40 MHz range. \nAssume for this example that the input data rate is 622.08 Mb/s \n(OC -12). After following Step 1 through Step 4, the value that is \nread back on FREQ[22:0] = 0x9B851, which is equal to 637 × 103. \nPlugging this value into the equation yields  \n637e3 × 32e6/2(14+1) = 622.08 Mb/s  \nIf subsequent frequency measurements are required, CTRLA[1] should remain set to 1. It does not need to be reset. The \nmeasurement process is reset by writing a 1 followed by a 0 to \nCTRLB[3]. This initiates a new data rate measurement. Follow Step 2 through Step 4 to read back the new data rate.  \nNote  that a  data rate readback is valid only if LOL is low. If LOL \nis high, the data rate readback is inval id. \nTable 12. \nD22  D21...D17  D16  D15  D14...D9  D8 D7 D6...D1  D0 \nFREQ2[6:0]  FREQ1[7:0]  FREQ0[7:0]  \n  \nADN2816  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 19 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nPCB DESIGN GUIDELINES  \nProper RF PCB design techniques must be used for optimal \nperformance. \nPower Supply Connections and Ground Planes \nUse of one low impedance ground plane is recommended. The VEE pins should be soldered directly to the ground plane to \nreduce series inductance. If the ground plane is an internal \nplane and connections to the ground plane are made through vias, multiple vias can be used in parallel to reduce the series inductance, especially on Pin 23, which is the ground return for the output buffers. The exposed pad should be connected to the \nGND plane using plugged vias  so that solder does not leak \nthrough the vias during reflow.  \nUse of a 22 μF electrolytic capacitor between VCC and VEE is \nrecommended at the location where the 3.3 V supply enters the \nPCB. When using 0.1 μF and 1 nF ceramic chip capacitors, they should be placed between the IC power supply VCC and VEE, \nas close as possible to the ADN2816 VCC pins.  If connections to the supply and ground are made through vias, \nthe use of multiple vias in parallel helps to reduce series \ninductance, especially on Pin 24, which supplies power to the high speed CLKOUTP/CLKOUTN and DATAOUTP/ \nDATAOUTN output buffers. Refer to Figure 19 for the \nrecommended connections. \nBy using adjacent power supply and GND planes, excellent high \nfrequency decoupling can be realized by using close spacing between the planes.

It is also necessary for the PIN/NIN input traces to be matched in length, and the CLKOUTP/ CLKOUTN and DATAOUTP/DATAOUTN output traces to be matched in length to avoid skew between the differential traces.  \nThe high speed inputs, PIN and NIN, are internally terminated \nwith 50 Ω to an internal reference voltage (see Figure 20). A 0.1 μF is recommended between VREF, Pin 3, and GND to \nprovide an ac ground for the inputs. \nAs with any high speed mixed-signal design, take care to keep \nall high speed digital traces away from sensitive analog nodes. \n04948-0-026CIN\nCIN\n50\uf057\n0.1\uf06dF50\uf057\n3k\uf057NINPINADN2816\n2.5V\nVREF50\uf057\n50\uf057TIAVCC\n \nFigure 20. ADN2816 AC-Coupled Input Configuration \nSoldering Guidelines for Lead  Frame Chip Scale Package \nThe lands on the 32-lead LFCSP are rectangular. The printed \ncircuit board (PCB) pad for these should be 0.1 mm longer than \nthe package land length and 0.05 mm wider than the package land width. The land should be centered on the pad. This ensures that the solder joint size is maximized. The bottom of the chip scale package has a central exposed pad. The pad on \nthe PCB should be at least as large as this exposed pad. The user \nmust connect the exposed pad to VEE using plugged vias so that solder does not leak through the vias during reflow. This \nensures a solid connection from the exposed pad to VEE. Choosing AC Coupling Capacitors \nAC coupling capacitors at the input (PIN, NIN) and output \n(DATAOUTP , DATAOUTN) of the ADN2816 must be chosen \nsuch that the device works properly over the full range of data \nrates used in the application. When choosing the capacitors, the time constant formed with the two 50 Ω resistors in the signal path must be considered. When a large number of consecutive identical digits (CIDs) are applied, the capacitor voltage can \ndroop due to baseline wander (see Figure 21), causing pattern-\ndependent jitter (PDJ). \nThe user must determine how much droop is tolerable and \nchoose an ac coupling capacitor based on that amount of droop. \nThe amount of PDJ can then be approximated based on the capacitor selection. The actual capacitor value selection can \nrequire some trade-offs between droop and PDJ. \nFor example, assuming 2% droop can be tolerated, then the \nmaximum differential droop is 4%. Normalizing to V p-p:  \nDroop  = Δ V = 0.04 V = 0.5 V p-p (1 − e\n–t/τ); therefore, τ = 12 t \nwhere:  \nτ is the RC time constant (C is the ac coupling capacitor, R = \n100 Ω seen by C). \nt is the total discharge time, which is equal to nT. \nn is the number of CIDs. T is the bit period. \nThe capacitor value can then be calculated by combining the \nequations for τ and t: \nC = 12 nT /R \nOnce the capacitor value is selected, the PDJ can be \napproximated as \n\uf028\uf029\uf028\uf0296 . 0 / 1 5 . 0rnT/RC\npspp e t PDJ\uf02d\uf02d \uf03d  \nwhere: \nPDJ pspp is the amount of pattern-dependent jitter allowed;  \n< 0.01 UI p-p typical. t\nr is the rise time, which is equal to 0.22/ BW,  \nwhere BW ~ 0.7 (bit rate). \nNote that this expression for t r is accurate only for the inputs. \nThe output rise time for the ADN2816 is ~100 ps, regardless of \ndata rate. \n \nData Sheet ADN2816\n \nRev.

DURING DATA PATTERNS WITH HIGH TRANSITION DENSITY, DIFFERENTIAL DC VOLTAGE AT V1 AND V2 IS ZERO.\n2. WHEN THE OUTPUT OF THE TIA GOES TO CID, V1 AND V1b ARE DRIVEN TO DIFFERENT DC LEVELS. V2 AND V2b DISCHARGE TO THE\nVREF LEVEL, WHICH EFFECTIVELY INTRODUCES A DIFFERENTIAL DC OFFSET ACROSS THE AC COUPLING CAPACITORS.\n3. WHEN THE BURST OF DATA STARTS AGAIN, THE DIFFERENTIAL DC OFFSET ACROSS THE AC COUPLING CAPACITORS IS APPLIED TO\nTHE INPUT LEVELS CAUSING A DC SHIFT IN THE DIFFERENTIAL INPUT. THIS SHIFT IS LARGE ENOUGH SUCH THAT ONE OF THE STATES,\nEITHER HIGH OR LOW DEPENDING ON THE LEVELS OF V1 AND V1b WHEN THE TIA WENT TO CID, IS CANCELED OUT. THE QUANTIZERDOES NOT RECOGNIZE THIS AS A VALID STATE.\n4. THE DC OFFSET SLOWLY DISCHARGES UNTIL THE DIFFERENTIAL INPUT VOLTAGE EXCEEDS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ADN2816. THE\nQUANTIZER CAN RECOGNIZE BOTH HIGH AND LOW STATES AT THIS POINT.\n \nFigure 21. Example of Baseline Wander \n \n \nADN2816  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.
