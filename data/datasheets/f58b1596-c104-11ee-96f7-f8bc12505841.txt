#### Description:
The SMFOC-1550-C-M-25-Z45-2D-1-9-10-FA is a single-mode fiber collimator designed for use with a working wavelength of 1550 nm. Its primary function is to collimate light from a single-mode fiber into a parallel beam, which is essential for various optical applications. The collimator features a C-lens design, which helps in achieving a small beam diameter of less than 0.45 mm.

#### Typical Applications:
This component is typically used in:
- **Telecommunications:** For fiber optic communication systems where precise light collimation is required.
- **Optical Sensors:** In applications where light needs to be directed accurately for sensing purposes.
- **Laser Systems:** To ensure that the output from a laser source is properly collimated for effective transmission.
- **Research and Development:** In laboratories where fiber optics are utilized for experiments and testing.

This collimator is particularly suited for environments where temperature variations are present, as it operates effectively within a range of -25 to +45 °C. The use of a G652D fiber type and FC/APC connector makes it compatible with standard fiber optic systems.
