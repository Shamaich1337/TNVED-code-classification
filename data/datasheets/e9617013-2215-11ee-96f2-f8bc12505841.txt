The total solution requires only three tiny external \ncomponents. It uses a  proprietary , high speed current mode, \nconstant  frequency PWM control scheme for excellent stability \nand transient response. To ensure the longest battery life in \nportable applications , the ADP2108  has a power save  mode  that \nreduces the switching frequency under light load conditions.  \nThe ADP2108 runs on input voltages of  2.3 V to 5.5  V, which \nallow s for single lithium or lithium polymer cell, multiple alkaline  \nor NiMH cell, PCMCIA, USB,  and other standard power sources.  \nThe maximum load current of 6 00 mA is achievable across the \ninput voltage range.   \nThe ADP2108  is available in fixed output voltages of 3.3  V, 3.0 V, \n2.5 V,  2.3 V, 1.82 V, 1.8 V,  1 . 5 V, 1.3 V,  1.2 V, 1.1 V , and 1.0  V. All \nversions include an internal power switch and synchronous rect -\nifier for minimal external part count and high efficiency. The \nADP2108 has an internal soft  start and is  internally compensated.  \nDuring logic  controlle d shutdown, the input is disconnected \nfrom the ou tput and the ADP2108 draws less than 1  μA from \nthe input source.  \nOther key features include undervoltage lockout to prevent deep  \nbattery discharge and soft start to prevent input current over -\nshoot at startup. The ADP2108 is available in 5 -ball WLCSP and \n5-lead TSOT packages. The ADP2109  provides the same features  \nand operations as the ADP2108  and has the additional function \nof a discharge switch in the WLCSP package.  \n \nTYPICAL APPLICATIONS  CIRCUIT  \n \n \nFigure 1. \n 1.0V TO 3.3V\n10µF1µH\nON\nOFF\nGND4.7µF\n07375-003VIN SW\nFB EN2.3V TO 5.5VADP2108\n Rev.

H | Page 11 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \n \nFigure 29. Functional Block Diagram \nThe ADP2108  is a step-down dc-to-dc converter that uses a \nfixed frequency and high speed current mode architecture. The \nhigh switching frequency allows for a small step-down, dc-to-dc \nconverter solution.  \nThe ADP2108  operates with an input voltage of 2.3 V to 5.5 V \nand regulates an output voltage down to 1.0 V .  \nCONTROL SCHEME \nThe ADP2108  operates with a fixed frequency, current mode \nPWM control architecture at medium to high loads for high \nefficiency, but shifts to a power save mode control scheme at \nlight loads to lower the regulation power losses. When operating \nin fixed frequency PWM mode, the duty cycle of the integrated switches is adjusted and regulates the output voltage. When operating in power save mode at light loads, the output voltage is controlled in a hysteretic manner, with higher V\nOUT ripple. \nDuring part of this time, the converter is able to stop switching and enters an idle mode, which improves conversion efficiency. \nPWM MODE \nIn PWM mode, the ADP2108  operates at a fixed frequency of \n3 MHz, set by an internal oscillator. At the start of each oscillator cycle, the PFET switch is turned on, sending a positive voltage across the inductor. Current in the inductor increases until the current sense signal crosses the peak inductor current threshold that turns off the PFET switch and turns on the NFET synchronous \nrectifier. This sends a negative voltage across the inductor, causing \nthe inductor current to decrease. The synchronous rectifier stays on for the rest of the cycle. The ADP2108  regulates the output \nvoltage by adjusting the peak inductor current threshold. POWER SAVE MODE \nThe ADP2108  smoothly transitions to the power save mode of \noperation when the load current decreases below the power save mode current threshold. When the ADP2108  enters power \nsave mode, an offset is induced in the PWM regulation level, which makes the output voltage rise. When the output voltage reaches a level approximately 1.5% above the PWM regulation \nlevel, PWM operation is turned off. At this point, both power \nswitches are off, and the ADP2108  enters an idle mode. C\nOUT \ndischarges until V OUT falls to the PWM regulation voltage, at \nwhich point the device drives the inductor to make V OUT rise \nagain to the upper threshold. This process is repeated while the load current is below the power save mode current threshold. \nPower Save Mode Current Threshold \nThe power save mode current threshold is set to 80 mA. The \nADP2108  employs a scheme that enables this current to remain \naccurately controlled, independent of V IN and V OUT levels. This \nscheme also ensures that there is very little hysteresis between the power save mode current threshold for entry to and exit from \nthe power save mode. The power save mode current threshold \nis optimized for excellent efficiency over all load currents. \nENABLE/SHUTDOWN \nThe ADP2108  starts operation with soft start when the EN pin \nis toggled from logic low to logic high. Pulling the EN pin low \nforces the device into shutdown mode, reducing the shutdown \ncurrent below 1 μA. \n  GNDFBVIN\nSW\nENADP2108\n07375-001SOFT START\nUNDERVOLTAGE\nLOCKOUTOSCILLATOR\nTHERMAL\nSHUTDOWNDRIVER\nAND\nANTISHOOT-\nTHROUGHPSM\nCOMP\nLOW\nCURRENTPWM\nCOMP\nILIMITGM ERROR\nAMP\nPWM/\nPSM\nCONTROL\nADP2108 Data Sheet \n \nSHORT -CIRCUIT PROTECTION  \nThe ADP2108 includes frequency fold back to prevent output \ncurrent runaway on a hard short. When the voltage at the \nfeedback pin falls below half the target output voltage, indicat-ing the possibility of a hard short at the output, the switc hing \nfrequency is reduced to half the internal oscillator frequency. \nThe reduction in the switching frequency allow s more time for \nthe inductor to discharge, preventing a runaway of output current.  \nUNDERVOLTAGE  LOCKOUT  \nTo protect against battery discharge, undervoltage lockout \n(UVLO) circuitry is integ rated on the ADP2108. If the input \nvoltage drops below the 2.15  V UVLO threshold, the ADP2108  \nshut s down, and both the power switch  and the synchronous \nrectifier turn  off. When  the voltage rises above the UVLO thre sh-\nold, the soft start period is initiated, and the part is enabled.  \nTHERMAL PROTECTION  \nIn the event th at th e ADP2108 junction temperature rise s above \n150°C, the thermal shutdown circuit turns off the converter. \nExtreme junction temperatures can be the result of high current operation, poor circuit board design, or high ambient temperature.  \nA 20°C hysteresis is in cluded so  that when thermal shutdown \noccurs, the ADP2108 does not return to operation until the  \non-chip temperature drops below 130°C. When coming out  \nof thermal shutdown, soft start is initiated.  \nSOFT  START  \nThe ADP2108 has an internal soft start function that ramps the \noutput voltage in a controlled manner upon startup, there by \nlimiting the inrush current. This prevents possib le input voltage \ndrops when a battery or a  high impedance power source is  \nconnected to the input of the converter.  After the EN pin is driven high,  internal circuits start to power  up. \nThe time require d to settle  after the EN pin is driven high is called  \nthe power -up time. After the internal circuits are powered  up, the \nsoft start ramp is initiated and the output capacitor is charged \nlinearly until the output voltage is in regulation. The time required  \nfor the output voltage to ramp  is called the soft  start time.  \nStart -up time in the ADP2108 is the measure of when the \noutput is in regulation after the EN pin is driven high. Start -up \ntime consists of the power -up time and the soft start time.  \nCURRENT LIMIT  \nThe ADP2108 has protection circuitry to limit the amount of \npositive current flowing through the PFET  switch and the \nsynchronous rectifier. The positive current limit on the power switch limits the amount of current that can fl ow from the input \nto the output . The negative current limit prevents the inductor \ncurrent from reversing direction and flowing out of the load.  \n100% DUTY O PERATION  \nWith a drop in V IN or with  an increase in I LOAD, the ADP2108 \nreach es a limit where, even with the PFET switch on 100%  of \nthe time, V OUT drop s below the desired output voltage. At this \nlimit, the ADP2108 smoothly transitions to a mode where the \nPFET switch stays  on 100% of the time. When the input conditions  \nchange again and the required duty cycle fa lls, the ADP2108 \nimmediately re start s PWM regulation without allowing over -\nshoot on V OUT. \n \nRev.

Because the ADP2108 is a high switching frequency dc -to-dc converter, \nshielded ferrite core material is recommended  for its low core \nlosses and low EMI. \n \n \n  Table 6.

When choosing this value , \nit is also important to account for the loss of capacitance due to \noutput voltage dc bias.  \nCeramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics,  \neach with different behavior over temperature and ap plied voltage.  \nCapacitors must have a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum  \ncapacitance over the necessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V \nor 10 V are recommended for best performance. Y5V  and Z5U \ndielectrics are not recommended for use with any dc -to-dc \nconverter because of their poor temperature and dc bias \ncharacteristics.  \nThe worst -case capacitance accounting for capacitor variation \nover temperature, component tolerance, and voltage  is calcu-\nlated using the following equation : \nC\nEFF = COUT × (1 −  TEMPCO ) × (1 − TOL ) \nwhere : \nCEFF is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage.  \nTEMPCO  is the worst -case capacitor temperature coefficient.  \nTOL  is the worst -case component tolerance.  \nIn th is example, the worst -case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO) \nover −40°C to + 125°C is assumed to be 15% for an X5R dielectric.  \nThe tolerance of the capacitor (TOL ) is assumed to be 10% , and \nCOUT is 9.2 μF at 1.8 V , as shown in Figure 30. \nSubstituting these values in the equation yields  \nCEFF = 9.2  μF × (1 −  0.15) × (1 −  0.1) = 7.0  μF \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP2108, it is imperative \nthat the effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on t he \nbehavior of the capacitors b e evaluated for each application.  \nRev.

If the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter goes into thermal shutdown. It \nrecovers when  the junction temperature falls below 130°C.  \nThe junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient \ntemperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the \npackage due to power dissipation, as shown in the following \nequation : \nT\nJ = TA + TR \nwhere : \nTJ is the junction temperature.  \nTA is the ambient temperature . \nTR is the rise in temperature of the package due to power \ndissipation.  \nThe rise in temperature of the package is directly proportional to the power dissipation in the package. The proportionality \nconstant for this relationship is the thermal resistance from the \njunction of the die to the ambient temperature, as shown in the \nfollowing equ ation : \nT\nR = θJA × PD \nwhere : \nTR is the rise in  temperature of the package.  \nθJA is the thermal resistance from the junction of the die to the \nambient temperature of the package . \nPD is the power dissipation in the package.  \nPCB LAYOUT GUIDELINE S \nPoor layout ca n affect ADP2108 performance , causing electro -\nmagnetic interference (EMI) and elect romagnetic compatibility \n(EMC) problems , ground bounce , and voltage losses. Poor \nlayout can also affect regulation and stability. A good layout is  \nimplemented using the following rules:  \n• Place the inductor, input capacitor , and output capacitor \nclose to the IC using short tracks. These components carry  \nhigh switching frequencies , and large tracks act as antennas.  \n• Route the output voltage path away from the inductor and \nSW node to minimize n oise and magnetic interference.  \n• Maximi ze the size of ground metal on the component side \nto help with thermal dissipation.  \n• Use a ground plane with several vias connect ing to the com -\nponent side ground to further reduce noise interference on sensitive circuit nodes.  \n 024681012\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n07375-007 DC BIAS VOLTAGE (V)CAPACITANCE ( µF)\nRev.
