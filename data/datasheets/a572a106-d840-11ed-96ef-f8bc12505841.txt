The parts use a patented trimming technique \nthat achieves superior precision without laser trimming. The AD8615/ AD8616 /AD8618 are fully specified to operate from \n2.7 V to 5 V single supplies.  \nThe combination of >20 MHz bandwidth, low offset, low noise, \nand low input bias current makes these amplifiers useful in a wide variety of applications. Filters, integrators, photodiode \namplifiers, and high impedance sensors all benefit from the \ncombination of performance features. AC applications benefit from the wide bandwidth and low distortion. The AD8615/ AD8616 / \nAD8618 offer the highest output drive capability of the DigiTrim® family, which is excellent for audio line drivers and other low \nimpedance applications. \nApplications for the parts include portable and low powered \ninstrumentation, audio amplification for portable devices, \nportable phone headsets, bar code scanners, and multipole filters. The ability to swing rail-to-rail at both the input and output enables designers to buffer CMOS ADCs, DACs, ASICs, \nand other wide output swing devices in single-supply systems.

The resistor values \ncan be determined by the equation \nmA 5VSY\uf03c\uf02d\nSIN\nRV \nThe extremely low input bias current allows the use of larger \nresistors, which allows the user to apply higher voltages at the \ninputs. The use of these resistors adds thermal noise, which \ncontributes to the overall output voltage noise of the amplifier.  \nFor example, a 10 kΩ resistor has less than 13 nV/√Hz of \nthermal noise and less than 10 nV of error voltage at room \ntemperature. \nOUTPUT PHASE REVERSAL \nThe AD8615 /AD8616/ AD8618 are immune to phase inversion, \na phenomenon that occurs when the voltage applied at the input of the amplifier exceeds the maximum input common mode. \nPhase reversal can cause permanent damage to the amplifier \nand can create lock ups in systems with feedback loops. \nVOLTAGE (2V/DIV)\nTIME (2ms/DIV)VINVOUTVS= ±2.5V\nVIN= 6V p-p\nAV= 1\nRL= 10kΩ\n04648-036 \nFigure 36. No Phase Reversal \nDRIVING CAPACITIVE LOADS \nAlthough the AD8615/ AD8616/ AD8618 are capable of driving \ncapacitive loads of up to 500 pF without oscillating, a large amount \nof overshoot is present when operating at frequencies above \n100 kHz. This is especially true when the amplifier is configured  in positive unity gain (worst case). When such large capacitive loads are required, the use of external compensation is highly \nrecommended.  This reduces the overshoot and minimizes ringing, which in \nturn improves the frequency response of the AD8615/ AD8616/ \nAD8618. One simple technique for compensation is the snubber, which consists of a simple RC netw ork. With this circuit in place, \noutput swing is maintained and the amplifier is stable at all gains. \nFigure 38 shows the implementation of the snubber, which \nreduces overshoot by more than 30% and eliminates ringing \nthat can cause instability. Using the snubber does not recover \nthe loss of bandwidth incurred from a heavy capacitive load. \nVOLT AGE (100mV/DIV)\nTIME (2µs/DIV)VS = ±2.5V\nAV = 1\nCL = 500pF\n04648-037 \nFigure 37.

In both cases, the time elapsed \nbefore the AD8616 comes out of saturation is less than 1 μs. In \naddition, the symmetry between the positive and negative recovery times allows excellent signal rectification without distortion to the \noutput signal. \nTIME (1µs/DIV)VS = ±2.5V\nRL = 10kΩ\nAV = 100\nVIN = 50mV\n–50mV+2.5V\n0V0V\n04648-040 \nFigure 40.

Buffering DAC Output  \nLOW NOISE APPLICATIONS \nAlthough the AD8618  typically has less than 8 nV/√Hz of voltage \nnoise density at 1 kHz, it is possible to reduce it further. A simple \nmethod is to connect the amplifiers in parallel, as shown in \nFigure 43. The total noise at the output is divided by the square \nroot of the number of amplifiers. In this case, the total noise is approximately 4 nV/√Hz at room temperature. The 100 Ω resistor limits the current and provides an effective output \nresistance of 50 Ω. \nV–R3\n100ΩR1\n10ΩV+VIN3\n21\nR2\n1kΩ\nV–R6\n100ΩR4\n10ΩV+3\n21\nR5\n1kΩ\nV–R9\n100ΩR7\n10ΩV+3\n21\nR8\n1kΩ\nV–R12\n100ΩR10\n10ΩV+3\n21\nR11\n1kΩVOUT\n04648-043 \nFigure 43.

The very low input bias, low current noise, and \nhigh unity -gain bandwidth of the parts make them suitable, \nespecially for high speed photodiode preamp lifier s. \nIn high speed photodiode applications, the diode is operated in a \nphotoconductive mode (reverse biased). This lowers the junction  \ncapacitance at the expense of an increase in the amount of dark \ncurrent that flows out of the diode.  \nThe total input capacitance, C1,  is the sum of the diode and op \namp input capacitances. This creates a feedback pole that causes degradation of the phase margin, making the op amp unstable. \nTherefore, it is necessary to use a capacitor in the feedback to \ncompensate for this pole.  \nTo get  the maximum signal bandwidth, select  \nUf2R1C2Cπ=2 \nwhere fU is the unity -gain bandwidth of the amplifier.  \nV–\n+2.5VV+–2.5VR2C2\nCIN CD RSH ID\n–VBIAS–\n+\n04648-044 \nFigure 44.

This should never \nbe exceeded because the device could suffer premature failure. \nAccurately measuring power dissipation of an integrated circuit is not always a straightforward exercise; Figure 47 is a design aid \nfor setting a safe output current drive level or selecting a heat sink for the package options available on the AD8616.

G | Page 13 of 20 \nAD8615/AD8616/AD8618  Data Sheet  \n \nThe following formula can be used to calculate the internal \njunction temperature of the AD8615/ AD8616 /AD8618 for any \napplication:  \nTJ = PDISS × θJA + TA \nwhere:  \nTJ = junction temperature  \nPDISS = power dissipation  \nθJA = package thermal resistance, junction -to-case \nTA = ambient temperature of the circuit  \nTo calculate the power dissipated by the AD8615 /AD8616 / \nAD8618, use  the following:  \nPDISS = ILOAD × (VS – VOUT) \nwhere:  \nILOAD = output load current  \nVS = supply voltage  \nVOUT = output voltage  \nThe quantity within the parentheses is the maximum voltage \ndeveloped across either output transistor.  \nPOWER CALCULATIONS F OR VARYING OR \nUNKNOWN LOADS  \nOften, calculating power dissipated by an integrated circuit to \ndetermine if the device is being operated  in a safe range is not as  \nsimple as it m ay seem. In many cases, power cannot be directly \nmeasured. This may be the result of irregular output waveforms or \nvarying loads. Indirect methods of measuring power are required.  \nThere are two methods to calculate power dissipated by an  \nintegrated circuit. The first is to measure the package temperature  \nand the board temperature. The second is to  directly measure \nthe circuit ’s supply current.  Calculating Power by Measuring Ambient Temperature \nand Case Temperature  \nThe two equations for calculating the junction temperature are  \nTJ = TA + P θJA \nwhere:  \nTJ = junction temperature  \nTA = ambient temperature  \nθJA = the junction -to-ambient thermal resistance  \nTJ = TC + P θ JC \nwhere:  \nTC is case temperature . \nθJA and θJC are given in the data sheet.  \nThe two equations for calculating P (power) are  \nTA + P θJA = TC + P θJC \nP = (T A − TC)/(θJC − θJA) \nOnce the power is determined, it is necessary to recalculate the \njunction temperature to ensure that the temperature  was not \nexceeded.  \nThe temperature should be measured directly on and near the \npackage but not touc hing it. Measuring the package can be \ndifficult. A very small bimetallic junction glued to the package \ncan be used, or an infrared sensing device can be used, if the \nspot size is small enough.  \nCalculating Power by Measuring Supply Current  \nIf the supply voltage and current are known, p ower can be \ncalculated directly. However, the supply current can have a dc component with a pulse directed into a capacitive load, which \ncan make the rms current very difficult to calculate. This difficulty  \ncan be overcome by l ifting the supply pin and inserting an rms \ncurrent meter into the circuit. For this method to work, make sure the current is delivered by the supply pin being measured. This is usually a good method in a single -supply system; however,  \nif the system uses du al supplies, both supplies may need to be \nmonitored.  \n \nRev.
