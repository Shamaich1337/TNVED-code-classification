OPERATION \nThe MP4569 is a 75V, 0.3A, synchronous, step-\ndown switching regulator with integrated high-\nside and low-side high-voltage power MOSFETs \n(HS_FET and LS_FET, respectively). It provides \na highly-efficient, 0.3A output. It features a wide \ninput voltage range, external soft-start control, and precision current limit. Its very low \noperational quiescent current makes it suitable \nfor battery-powered applications. \nControl Scheme \nThe ILIM comparator, FB comparator and zero \ncurrent detector (ZCD) block control the PWM. If \nV\nFB is below the 1V reference and the inductor \ncurrent drops to zero, HS_FET turns on and the \nILIM comparator starts to sense the HS_FET \ncurrent: When the HS_FET current reaches the limit, the HS_FET turns off and LS_FET turns on \ntogether with the ZCD block. Meanwhile, the ILIM \ncomparator is turned off to reduce the quiescent \ncurrent. The LS_FET turns off together with ZCD \nblock after the inductor current drops to zero. If \nV\nFB is less than the 1V reference at this time, the \nHS_FET turns on at once and commences another cycle. If V\nFB is still higher than 1V \nreference, HS_FET would not turn on till V FB \ndrops below 1V. \nVSWVFB\nILIpeak\nIoVREF\nIo increase\n \nFigure2 - Control Scheme  \nInternal Regulator and BIAS \nThe 2.6V internal regulator powers most of the \ninternal circuitry. This regulator takes V IN and \noperates in the full V IN range. When V IN is greater \nthan 3.0V, the output of the regulator is in full \nregulation. Lower values of V IN result in lower \noutput voltages. When V BIAS>2.9V, the bias \nsupply overrides the input voltage and supplies power to the internal regulator. When V\nBIAS>4.5V, \nit can power LS_FET driver furthermore. Using \nBIAS to power internal regulator can improve the \nefficiency. It is recommended to connect BIAS to \nthe regulated output voltage when it is in the \nrange of 2.9V to 5.5V. When output voltage is out \nof above range, an external supply that is >2.9V or even better >4.5V can be used to power BIAS. \n \nEnable Control \nThe MP4569 has a dedicated enable-control pin, \nEN: when V\nIN goes high, the EN pin enables and \ndisables the chip. This is HIGH logic. Its trailing \nthreshold is a consistent 1.2V. Its rising threshold \nis about 350mV higher. When floating, EN pin is \ninternally pulled down to GND to disable the chip.  \nWhen EN = 0V, the chip goes into the lowest \nshutdown-current mode. When EN is higher than \nzero but lower than its rising threshold, the chip \nremains in shutdown mode with a slightly larger \nshutdown current.  \nInternally a zener diode is connected from EN pin \nto GND pin. The typical clamping voltage of the \nzener diode is 6.5V. So VIN can be connected to \nEN through a high ohm resistor if the system \ndoesn\'t have another logic input acting as enable \nsignal. The resistor needs to be designed to limit the EN pin sink current less than 150 μA. Just \nnote that there is an internal 3M resistor from EN \nto GND, so the external pull up resistor should be \nsmaller than \n1.55V3M 1.55V]- [V(MIN)IN × to make sure \nthe part can EN on at the lowest operation VIN. \n \nMP4569―75V, 0.3A, SYNCHRONOUS STEP-DOWN CONVERTER \n \nMP4569 Rev. 1.0 www.MonolithicPower.com 11 \n9/12/2014 MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protected. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited. \n © 2014 MPS. All Rights Reserved. Under-Voltage Lockout \nVIN under voltage lockout (UVLO) protects the \nchip from operating below the operational supply \nvoltage range. The UVLO-rising threshold is about 4.2V while its trailing threshold is about \n3.75V.  \nSoft-start \nReference-type soft-start prevents the converter \noutput voltage from overshooting during startup. When the chip starts, the internal circuitry \ngenerates a constant current to charge external \nSS capacitor. The soft-start (SS) voltage slowly \nramps up from 0V at a slow pace set by the soft-\nstart time. When V\nSS is less than the V REF, V SS \noverrides V REF so the FB comparator uses V SS \ninstead of V REF as the reference. When V SS is \nhigher than V REF, VREF resumes control. \nVSS is also associated with V FB. Though V SS can \nbe much smaller than V FB, it can only barely \nexceed V FB. If somehow V FB drops, V SS tracks \nVFB. This function prevents output voltage \novershoot in short-circuit recovery -- when the \nshort circuit is removed, the SS ramps up as if it \nis a fresh soft-start process.  \nThermal Shutdown \nThermal shutdown prevents the chip from \nthermally running away. When the silicon die \ntemperature exceeds its upper threshold, the \nthermal shutdown feature shuts down the whole \nchip. When the temperature falls below its lower \nthreshold, the chip resumes function. \nFloating Driver and Bootstrap Charging \nThe external bootstrap capacitor powers the \nfloating HS_FET driver.  This floating driver has \nits own UVLO protection, with a rising threshold \nof about 2.4V with a hysteresis of about 300mV. During this UVLO, the SS voltage resets to zero. \nWhen the UVLO is disabled, the regulator follows \nthe soft-start process. \nThe dedicated internal bootstrap regulator \ncharges and regulates the bootstrap capacitor to \nabout 5V. When the voltage difference between \nBST and SW falls below its working parameters, a PMOS pass transistor connected from V\nIN to \nBST turns on to charge the bootstrap capacitor. \nThe current path is from V IN to BST and then to  SW. The external circuit must have enough \nvoltage headroom to accommodate charging. \nAs long as V IN is sufficiently higher than SW, the \nbootstrap capacitor can charge. When the HS_FET is ON, V\nIN is about equal to SW so the \nbootstrap capacitor cannot charge. The best \ncharging period occurs when the LS_FET is on \nso that V IN - V SW is at its largest. When there is \nno current in the inductor, V SW equals V OUT so the \ndifference between V IN and V OUT can charge the \nbootstrap capacitor. \nIf the internal circuit does not have sufficient \nvoltage and time to charge the bootstrap \ncapacitor, extra external circuitry can be used to \nensure the bootstrap voltage in normal operation \nregion. \nStartup and Shutdown \nIf both V IN and V EN are higher than their \nappropriate thresholds, the chip starts operating. \nThe reference block starts first, generating stable \nreference voltage and currents, and then enables the internal regulator. The regulator provides \nstable supply for the rest device. \nWhile the internal supply rail is high, an internal \ntimer holds the power MOSFET off for about \n50µsec to blank startup glitches. When the soft-start block is enabled, it first holds its SS output \nlow and then slowly ramps up. \nThree events shut down the chip: V\nEN low, V IN \nlow, and junction temperature triggers the \nthermal shutdown threshold. For shutdown, the signaling path is blocked first to avoid any fault \ntriggering. Internal supply rail are pulled down \nthen. The floating driver is not subject to this \nshutdown command, but its charging path is \ndisabled. \nPower OK (POK) \nPOK is an open drain power good output. “HIGH” \noutput indicates VOUT is higher than 90% of its \nnominal value. POK is pulled down in shutdown \nmode. \nReference Voltage Output (VREF) \nVREF pin output 1V reference voltage. It has up \nto 500uA source current capability. \nMP4569―75V, 0.3A, SYNCHRONOUS STEP-DOWN CONVERTER \n \nMP4569 Rev. 1.0 www.MonolithicPower.com 12 \n9/12/2014 MPS Proprietary Information.

APPLICATION INFORMATION \nSelecting the Inductor \nAs the Ipeak is fixed, for given input voltage and \noutput voltage, the inductor value can be \ndetermined by the following formula: \n()\ns peak INOUT IN OUT\nf IVV-V VL×××=  \nWhere fs is the switching frequency at the \nmaximal output current. \nLarger inductor value results in lower switching \nfrequency, as well as higher efficiency. However, \nthe larger value inductor will have a larger \nphysical size, higher series resistance, and/or \nlower saturation current as well as the slow load transient dynamic performance. There is also a \nlower limit of the inductor value, which is \ndetermined by the minimum on time.
