This multiplexer is designed on an advancedsubmicron process that provides low power dissipation yet gives\nhigh switching speed, low on resistance, low leakage currents\nand high bandwidths.\nThe on resistance profile is very flat over the full analog signal\nrange. This ensures excellent linearity and low distortion when\nswitching audio signals. Fast switching speed also makes the\npart suitable for video signal switching.\nThe ADG704 can operate from a single supply range of +1.8 V\nto +5.5 V, making it ideal for use in battery powered instru-\nments and with the new generation of DACs and ADCs from\nAnalog Devices.\nThe ADG704 switches one of four inputs to a common output,\nD, as determined by the 3-bit binary address lines, A0, A1 and\nEN. A Logic “0” on the EN pin disables the device.\nEach switch of the ADG704 conducts equally well in both\ndirections when ON. The ADG704 exhibits break-before-makeswitching action.\nThe ADG704 is available in 10-lead mSOIC package.PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. +1.8 V to +5.5 V Single Supply Operation.\nThe ADG704 offers high performance and is fully specifiedand guaranteed with +3 V and +5 V supply rails.\n2. Very Low R\nON (4.5 W Max at 5 V, 8 W Max at 3 V).\nAt supply voltage of +1.8 V, R ON is typically 35 W over the\ntemperature range.\n3.
