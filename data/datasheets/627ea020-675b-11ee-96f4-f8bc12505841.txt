This\ncommunications topology isoften referred toassimplex. InFigure 18thedriver receives asingle-ended input\nsignal and thereceiver outputs asingle-ended recovered signal. The LVDS driver converts thesingle-ended\ninput toadifferential signal fortransmission over abalanced interconnecting media of100-Ωcharacteristic\nimpedance.

Thedevice cansupport operation with asupply aslow\nas2.4Vandashigh as3.6V.Thedriver output voltage isdependent upon thechosen supply voltage. Asshown\ninDriver Electrical Characteristics ,thedifferential output voltage isnominally 350mVover thecomplete output\nrange. The minimum output voltage stays within thespecified LVDS limits (247 mVto454 mV) fora3.3-V\nsupply. Ifthesupply range isbetween 2.4Vand3V,theminimum output voltage may beaslowas200mV. Ifa\ncommunication linkisdesigned tooperate with asupply within thislower range, thechannel noise margin will\nneed tobelooked atcarefully toensure error-free operation.\n10.2.1.2.2 Driver Bypass Capacitance\nBypass capacitors play akeyrole inpower distribution circuitry. Specifically, they create low-impedance paths\nbetween power and ground. Atlowfrequencies, agood digital power supply offers very low-impedance paths\nbetween itsterminals. However, ashigher frequency currents propagate through power traces, thesource is\nquite often incapable ofmaintaining alow-impedance path toground. Bypass capacitors areused toaddress this\nshortcoming. Usually, large bypass capacitors (10μFto1000μF)attheboard-level doagood jobupintothe\nkHzrange. Due totheir size andlength oftheir leads, they tend tohave large inductance values attheswitching\nfrequencies ofmodern digital circuitry. Tosolve thisproblem, one must resort totheuseofsmaller capacitors\n(nFtoμFrange) installed locally next totheintegrated circuit.\nMultilayer ceramic chip orsurface-mount capacitors (size 0603 or0805) minimize lead inductances ofbypass\ncapacitors inhigh-speed environments, because their lead inductance isabout 1nH.Forcomparison purposes,\natypical capacitor with leads hasalead inductance around 5nH.\nThe value ofthebypass capacitors used locally with LVDS chips canbedetermined bythefollowing formula\naccording toJohnson, equations 8.18 to8.21. Aconservative risetime of200 psand aworst-case change in\nsupply current of1Acovers thewhole range ofLVDS devices offered byTexas Instruments. Inthisexample, the\nmaximum power supply noise tolerated is200 mV; however, thisfigure varies depending onthenoise budget\navailable inyour design.(1)\n(1)\n(2)\nThe following example lowers lead inductance and covers intermediate frequencies between theboard-level\ncapacitor (>10µF)andthevalue ofcapacitance found above (0.001 µF).You should place thesmallest value of\ncapacitance asclose aspossible tothechip.\nFigure 19.Recommended LVDS Bypass Capacitor Layout\n(1) Howard Johnson &Martin Graham.1993.

Theinput stage canaccept signals as\nhigh as5V,independent ofthesupply voltage being used onthedriver. This wide input range allows operation\nwith 3.3-V and5-Vsources. While theinput stage does support thiswide input range, thedriver willoperate with\nadecision threshold of~1.4 V.For LVTTL input signals, this threshold iswell-matched tothevoltages\nrepresenting HIandLOlogic levels. For5-VTTL input signals andCMOS input signals, thisfixed threshold at\n1.4Vwillresult insome duty-cycle distortion. Thelevel ofthedistortion iseasily calculated based upon theinput\nslew rate, aswell asthesignaling rate oftheinput data. Quite often thisdistortion isinsignificant, although the\ndesigner should consider thiseffect where thedevice isoperated athigher speeds, orwhen duty-cycle isa\ncritical feature.\n10.2.1.2.4 Driver Output Voltage\nTheSN65LVDS1 driver output isa1.2-V common-mode voltage, with anominal differential output signal of350\nmV. This 350 mVistheabsolute value ofthedifferential swing (VOD=|V+–V–|).The peak-to-peak differential\nvoltage istwice thisvalue, or700mV. Asmentioned previously, theminimum differential output voltage is200\nmVwhen thesupply voltage isbetween 2.4Vand 3V.While 200 mVdoes notmeet theminimum specified\nvoltage foranLVDS-compliant driver, thedesigner may choose toemploy thisdriver with alower supply voltage,\naslong asattention ispaid tothechannel noise margin.\nAswewillseeshortly, LVDS receiver thresholds are±100mV. With these receiver decision thresholds, itisclear\nthatthedisadvantage ofoperating thedriver with alower supply willbenoise margin. With fully compliant LVDS\ndrivers and receivers, wewould expect aminimum of~150 mVofnoise margin (247-mV minimum output\nvoltage –100-mV maximum input requirement). Ifweoperate theSN65LVDS1 with asupply intherange of2.4\nVto3V,theminimum noise margin willdrop to100mV(200 mV–100mV).\n10.2.1.2.5 Interconnecting Media\nThe physical communication channel between thedriver and thereceiver may beanybalanced paired metal\nconductors meeting therequirements oftheLVDS standard, thekeypoints which willbeincluded here. This\nmedia may beatwisted pair, twinax, flatribbon cable, orPCB traces.\nThenominal characteristic impedance oftheinterconnect should bebetween 100Ωand120Ωwith variation no\nmore than 10% (90Ωto132Ω).\n10.2.1.2.6 PCB Transmission Lines\nAsperSNLA187 ,Figure 20depicts several transmission linestructures commonly used inprinted-circuit boards\n(PCBs). Each structure consists ofasignal lineandareturn path with uniform cross-section along itslength. A\nmicrostrip isasignal trace onthetop(orbottom) layer, separated byadielectric layer from itsreturn path ina\nground orpower plane. Astripline isasignal trace intheinner layer, with adielectric layer inbetween aground\nplane above and below thesignal trace. The dimensions ofthestructure along with thedielectric material\nproperties determine thecharacteristic impedance ofthetransmission line(also called controlled-impedance\ntransmission line).\nWhen twosignal lines areplaced close by,they form apair ofcoupled transmission lines. Figure 20shows\nexamples ofedge-coupled microstrips, and edge-coupled orbroad-side-coupled striplines. When excited by\ndifferential signals, thecoupled transmission lineisreferred toasadifferential pair. Thecharacteristic impedance\nofeach lineiscalled odd-mode impedance. Thesum oftheodd-mode impedances ofeach lineisthedifferential\nimpedance ofthedifferential pair. Inaddition tothetrace dimensions and dielectric material properties, the\nspacing between thetwotraces determines themutual coupling andimpacts thedifferential impedance. When\nthetwolines areimmediately adjacent; forexample, Sisless than 2W, thedifferential pair iscalled atightly-\ncoupled differential pair. Tomaintain constant differential impedance along thelength, itisimportant tokeep the\ntrace width andspacing uniform along thelength, aswellasmaintain good symmetry between thetwolines.\nCopyright ©1999 –2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LVDS1 SN65LVDS2 SN65LVDT2\nSN65LVDS1 ,SN65LVDS2 ,SN65LVDT2\nSLLS373L –JULY 1999 –REVISED DECEMBER 2014 www.ti.com\nFigure 20.Controlled-Impedance Transmission Lines\n10.2.1.2.7 Termination Resistor\nAsshown earlier, anLVDS communication channel employs acurrent source driving atransmission linewhich is\nterminated with aresistive load. This load serves toconvert thetransmitted current intoavoltage atthereceiver\ninput. Toensure incident wave switching (which isnecessary tooperate thechannel atthehighest signaling\nrate), thetermination resistance should bematched tothecharacteristic impedance ofthetransmission line. The\ndesigner should ensure that thetermination resistance iswithin 10% ofthenominal media characteristic\nimpedance. Ifthetransmission line istargeted for100-Ωimpedance, thetermination resistance should be\nbetween 90Ωand110Ω.\nThe linetermination resistance should belocated asclose aspossible tothereceiver, thereby minimizing the\nstub length from theresistor tothereceiver. The limiting case would betoincorporate thetermination resistor\ninto thereceiver, which isexactly what isoffered with theSN65LVDT2. The SN65LVDT2 provides allthe\nfunctionality and performance oftheSN65LVDS2 receiver, with theadded feature ofanintegrated termination\nload.\nWhile wetalkinthissection about point-to-point communications, aword ofcaution isuseful when amultidrop\ntopology isused. Insuch topologies, line termination resistors aretobelocated only attheend(s) ofthe\ntransmission line. Insuch anenvironment, SN65LVDS2 receivers could beused forloads branching offthemain\nbus, with anSN65LVDT2 used only atthebusend.\n10.2.1.2.8 Driver NCPins\nNC(not connected) pins arepins where thedieisnotphysically connected tothelead frame orpackage.

While point-to-point\ninterconnects arestraightforward, and well understood, thebus type architecture encountered with multidrop\nsystems requires more careful attention. WewilluseFigure 22above toexplore these details.\nThe most basic multidrop system would include asingle driver, located atabusorigin, with multiple receiver\nnodes branching offthemain line, andafinal receiver attheendofthetransmission line, co-located with abus\ntermination resistor. While thiswould bethemost basic multidrop system, ithasseveral considerations notyet\nexplored.\nThelocation ofthetransmitter atonebusendallows thedesign concerns tobesimplified, butthiscomes atthe\ncost offlexibility. With atransmitter located attheorigin, asingle bustermination atthefar-end isrequired. The\nfar-end termination absorbs theincident traveling wave. The flexibility lostwith thisarrangement isthus: ifthe\nsingle transmitter needed toberelocated onthebus, atanylocation other than theorigin, wewould befaced\nwith abuswith one open-circuited end, and one properly terminated end. Locating thetransmitter sayinthe\nmiddle ofthebusmay bedesired toreduce (by½)themaximum flight time from thetransmitter toreceiver.\nAnother new feature inFigure 22isclear inthat every node branching offthemain lineresults instubs. The\nstubs should beminimized inanycase, buthave theunintended effect oflocally changing theloaded impedance\nofthebus.\nToagood approximation, thecharacteristic transmission lineimpedance seen intoanycutpoint intheunloaded\nmultipoint ormultidrop busisdefined by√L/C, where Listheinductance perunitlength andCisthecapacitance\nperunit length. Ascapacitance isadded tothebus intheform ofdevices and interconnections, thebus\ncharacteristic impedance islowered. This may result insignal reflections from theimpedance mismatch between\ntheunloaded andloaded segments ofthebus.\nIfthenumber ofloads isconstant and canbedistributed evenly along theline, reflections canbereduced by\nchanging thebustermination resistors tomatch theloaded characteristic impedance. Normally, thenumber of\nloads arenotconstant ordistributed evenly and thereflections resulting from any mismatching must be\naccounted forinthenoise budget.\n10.2.3.3 Application Curve\nFigure 23.Typical Driver Output EyePattern inMultidrop System\nCopyright ©1999 –2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LVDS1 SN65LVDS2 SN65LVDT2\nSN65LVDS1 ,SN65LVDS2 ,SN65LVDT2\nSLLS373L –JULY 1999 –REVISED DECEMBER 2014 www.ti.com\n11Power Supply Recommendations\nThe LVDS driver and receivers inthisdata sheet aredesigned tooperate from asingle power supply.

Microstrips aretraces ontheouter layer ofaPCB, asshown inFigure 24.\nFigure 24.Microstrip Topology\nOntheother hand, striplines aretraces between twoground planes. Striplines areless prone toemissions and\nsusceptibility problems because thereference planes effectively shield theembedded traces. However, from the\nstandpoint ofhigh-speed transmission, juxtaposing twoplanes creates additional capacitance. TIrecommends\nrouting LVDS signals onmicrostrip transmission lines, ifpossible. ThePCB traces allow designers tospecify the\nnecessary tolerances forZObased ontheoverall noise budget andreflection allowances.

FR-4, orequivalent, usually\nprovides adequate performance forusewith LVDS signals. Ifriseorfalltimes ofTTL/CMOS signals areless\nthan 500ps,empirical results indicate thatamaterial with adielectric constant near 3.4,such asRogers ™4350\norNelco N4000-13 isbetter suited. Once thedesigner chooses thedielectric, there areseveral parameters\npertaining totheboard construction thatcanaffect performance. Thefollowing setofguidelines were developed\nexperimentally through several designs involving LVDS devices:\n•Copper weight: 15gor1/2ozstart, plated to30gor1oz\n•Allexposed circuitry should besolder-plated (60/40) to7.62μmor0.0003 in(minimum).\n•Copper plating should be25.4μmor0.001 in(minimum) inplated-through-holes.\n•Solder mask over bare copper with solder hot-air leveling\n12.1.3 Recommended Stack Layout\nFollowing thechoice ofdielectrics and design specifications, youmust decide how many levels touseinthe\nstack. Toreduce theTTL/CMOS toLVDS crosstalk, itisagood practice tohave atleast twoseparate signal\nplanes asshown inFigure 26.\nFigure 26.Four-Layer PCB Board\nNOTE\nThe separation between layers 2and 3should be127μm(0.005 in).Bykeeping the\npower andground planes tightly coupled, theincreased capacitance acts asabypass for\ntransients.\nOne ofthemost common stack configurations isthesix-layer board, asshown inFigure 27.\nFigure 27.Six-Layer PCB Board\nInthisparticular configuration, itispossible toisolate each signal layer from thepower plane byatleast one\nground plane. The result isimproved signal integrity; however, fabrication ismore expensive. Using the6-layer\nboard ispreferable, because itoffers thelayout designer more flexibility invarying thedistance between signal\nlayers andreferenced planes, inaddition toensuring reference toaground plane forsignal layers 1and6.\n12.1.4 Separation Between Traces\nThe separation between traces depends onseveral factors; however, theamount ofcoupling that can be\ntolerated usually dictates theactual separation. Low noise coupling requires close coupling between the\ndifferential pairofanLVDS linktobenefit from theelectromagnetic field cancellation. Thetraces should be100-Ω\ndifferential and thus coupled inthemanner that best fitsthisrequirement. Inaddition, differential pairs should\nhave thesame electrical length toensure thatthey arebalanced, thus minimizing problems with skew andsignal\nreflection.\nCopyright ©1999 –2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LVDS1 SN65LVDS2 SN65LVDT2\nSN65LVDS1 ,SN65LVDS2 ,SN65LVDT2\nSLLS373L –JULY 1999 –REVISED DECEMBER 2014 www.ti.com\nLayout Guidelines (continued)\nInthecase oftwoadjacent single-ended traces, oneshould usethe3-W rule, which stipulates thatthedistance\nbetween twotraces must begreater than twotimes thewidth ofasingle trace, orthree times itswidth measured\nfrom trace center totrace center. This increased separation effectively reduces thepotential forcrosstalk. The\nsame ruleshould beapplied totheseparation between adjacent LVDS differential pairs, whether thetraces are\nedge-coupled orbroad-side-coupled.\nFigure 28.3-WRule forSingle-Ended andDifferential Traces (Top View)\nYou should exercise caution when using autorouters, because they donotalways account forallfactors affecting\ncrosstalk andsignal reflection. Forinstance, itisbest toavoid sharp 90°turns toprevent discontinuities inthe\nsignal path. Using successive 45°turns tends tominimize reflections.\n12.1.5 Crosstalk andGround Bounce Minimization\nToreduce crosstalk, itisimportant toprovide areturn path tohigh-frequency currents thatisasclose aspossible\ntoitsoriginating trace. Aground plane usually achieves this. Because thereturning currents always choose the\npath oflowest inductance, they aremost likely toreturn directly under theoriginal trace, thus minimizing\ncrosstalk. Lowering thearea ofthecurrent loop lowers thepotential forcrosstalk. Traces kept asshort as\npossible with anuninterrupted ground plane running beneath them emit theminimum amount ofelectromagnetic\nfield strength. Discontinuities intheground plane increase thereturn path inductance andshould beavoided.\n28 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1999 –2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LVDS1 SN65LVDS2 SN65LVDT2\nSN65LVDS1 ,SN65LVDS2 ,SN65LVDT2\nwww.ti.com SLLS373L –JULY 1999 –REVISED DECEMBER 2014\nLayout Guidelines (continued)\n12.1.6 Decoupling\nEach power orground lead ofahigh-speed device should beconnected tothePCB through alowinductance\npath. Forbest results, oneormore vias areused toconnect apower orground pintothenearby plane. Ideally,\nviaplacement isimmediately adjacent tothepintoavoid adding trace inductance. Placing apower plane closer\ntothetopoftheboard reduces theeffective vialength anditsassociated inductance.\nFigure 29.Low Inductance, High-Capacitance Power Connection\nBypass capacitors should beplaced close toVDDpins. They canbeplaced conveniently near thecorners or\nunderneath thepackage tominimize theloop area. This extends theuseful frequency range oftheadded\ncapacitance. Small-physical-size capacitors, such as0402 oreven 0201, orX7R surface-mount capacitors\nshould beused tominimize body inductance ofcapacitors. Each bypass capacitor isconnected tothepower and\nground plane through vias tangent tothepads ofthecapacitor asshown inFigure 30(a).\nAnX7R surface-mount capacitor ofsize 0402 hasabout 0.5nHofbody inductance. Atfrequencies above 30\nMHz orso,X7R capacitors behave aslow-impedance inductors. Toextend theoperating frequency range toa\nfewhundred MHz, anarray ofdifferent capacitor values like100pF,1nF,0.03μF,and0.1μFarecommonly\nused inparallel. Themost effective bypass capacitor canbebuilt using sandwiched layers ofpower andground\nataseparation of2to3mils. With a2-mil FR4 dielectric, there isapproximately 500pFpersquare inch ofPCB.\nRefer back toFigure 5-1 forsome examples. Many high-speed devices provide alow-inductance GND\nconnection onthebackside ofthepackage. This center dapmust beconnected toaground plane through an\narray ofvias. Theviaarray reduces theeffective inductance toground andenhances thethermal performance of\nthesmall Surface Mount Technology (SMT) package. Placing vias around theperimeter ofthedapconnection\nensures proper heat spreading and thelowest possible dietemperature. Placing high-performance devices on\nopposing sides ofthePCB using twoGND planes (asshown inFigure 20)creates multiple paths forheat\ntransfer. Often thermal PCB issues aretheresult ofonedevice adding heat toanother, resulting inavery high\nlocal temperature. Multiple paths forheat transfer minimize thispossibility. Inmany cases theGND dapthatisso\nimportant forheat dissipation makes theoptimal decoupling layout impossible toachieve duetoinsufficient pad-\nto-dap spacing asshown inFigure 30(b).When thisoccurs, placing thedecoupling capacitor onthebackside of\ntheboard keeps theextra inductance toaminimum. Itisimportant toplace theVDDviaasclose tothedevice pin\naspossible while stillallowing forsufficient solder mask coverage. Iftheviaisleftopen, solder may flow from the\npadandintotheviabarrel. This willresult inapoor solder connection.\nCopyright ©1999 –2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LVDS1 SN65LVDS2 SN65LVDT2\nSN65LVDS1 ,SN65LVDS2 ,SN65LVDT2\nSLLS373L –JULY 1999 –REVISED DECEMBER 2014 www.ti.com\nLayout Guidelines (continued)\nFigure 30.Typical Decoupling Capacitor Layouts\n12.2 Layout Example\nAtleast twoorthree times thewidth ofanindividual trace should separate single-ended traces anddifferential\npairs tominimize thepotential forcrosstalk.

Increase thespacing between signal paths forlong\nparallel runs toreduce crosstalk. Boards with limited realestate canbenefit from thestaggered trace layout, as\nshown inFigure 31.\nFigure 31.Staggered Trace Layout\nThis configuration lays outalternating signal traces ondifferent layers; thus, thehorizontal separation between\ntraces canbeless than 2or3times thewidth ofindividual traces.
