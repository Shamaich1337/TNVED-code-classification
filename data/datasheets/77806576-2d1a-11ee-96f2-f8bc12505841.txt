And please do not drop, bend or twist LCD module in handling. 10.2.2 Please design display housing in accordance with the following guide lines. 10.2.2.1 Housing case must be destined carefully so as not to put stresses on LCD all \nsides and not to wrench module. The stresses may cause non-uniformity even if there is no non-uniformity statically. \n10.2.2.2 Keep sufficient clearance between LCD module back surface and housing when the LCD module is mounted. The clearance in the design is recommended taking into account the tolerance of LCD module thickness and mounting structure height on the housing. 10.2.3 Please do not push or scratch LCD panel surface with any-thing hard. And do not soil LCD panel surface by touching with bare hands. ( Polarizer film, surface of LCD panel is easy to be flawed.) 10.2.4 Please do not press any parts on the rear side such as source IC, gate IC, and FPC during handling LCD module. If pressing rear part is unavoidable, handle the LCD module with care not to damage them. 10.2.5 Please wipe out LCD panel surface with absorbent cotton or soft cloth in case of it being soiled. 10.2.6 Please wipe out drops of adhesives like saliva and water on LCD panel surface immediately. They might damage to cause panel surface variation and color change. 10.2.7 Please do not take a LCD module to pieces and reconstruct it. Resolving and reconstructing modules may cause them not to work well. \n10.3 Disassembling or Modification \nDo not disassemble or modify the module. It may damage sensitive parts inside LCD module, and may cause scratches or dust on the display. HannStar does not warrant the module, if customers disassemble or modify the module. \n10.4 Breakage of LCD Panel \n10.4.1 If LCD panel is broken and liquid crystal spills out, do not ingest or inhale liquid \ncrystal, and do not contact liquid crystal with skin. 10.4.2 If liquid crystal contacts mouth or eyes, rinse out with water immediately. 10.4.3 If liquid crystal contacts skin or cloths, wash it off immediately with alcohol and rinse thoroughly with water. 10.4.4 Handle carefully with chips of glass that may cause injury, when the glass is broken. \n10.5 Absolute Maximum Ratings and Power Protection Circuit \n\n10.5.1 Do not exceed the absolute maximum rating values, such as the supply voltage \nvariation, input voltage variation, variation in parts’ parameters, environmental temperature, etc., otherwise LCD module may be damaged. 10.5.2 Please do not leave LCD module in the environment of high humidity and high temperature for a long time. 10.5.3 It’s recommended employing protection circuit for power supply. \n10.6 Operation \n10.6.1 Do not touch, push or rub the polarizer with anything harder than HB pencil lead.Use fingerstalls of soft gloves in order to keep clean display quality, when persons handle the LCD module for incoming inspection or assembly. 10.6.2 When the surface is dusty, please wipe gently with absorbent cotton or other soft material. 10.6.3 Wipe off saliva or water drops as soon as possible. If saliva or water drops contact with polarizer for a long time, they may causes deformation or color fading. 10.6.4 When cleaning the adhesives, please use absorbent cotton wetted with a little petroleum benzine or other adequate solvent. \n10.7 Static Electricity \n10.7.1 Protection film must remove very slowly from the surface of LCD module to prevent from electrostatic occurrence. 10.7.2 Because LCD module uses CMOS-IC on TFT-LCD panel, it is very weak to \nelectrostatic discharge. Please be careful with electrostatic discharge. 10.7.3 Persons who handle the module should be grounded through adequate methods. \n10.8 Disposal\nWhen disposing LCD module, obey the local environmental regulations. \n10.9 OTHERS \n10.9.1 A strong incident light into LCD panel might cause display characteristics' changing inferior because of polarizer film, color filter, and other materials becoming inferior. Please do not expose LCD module direct sunlight land strong UV rays. 10.9.2 Please pay attention to a panel side of LCD module not to contact with other materials in preserving it alone. 10.9.3 For the packaging box, please pay attention to the followings: 10.9.3.1 Packaging box and inner case for LCD are designed to protect the LCDs from the damage or scratching during transportation. Please do not open except picking LCDs up from the box. 10.9.3.2 Please do not pile them up more than 6 boxes. (They are not designed so.) And please do not turn over. 10.9.3.3 Please handle packaging box with care not to give them sudden shock and vibrations. And also please do not throw them up. 10.9.3.4 Packing box and inner case for LCDs are made of cardboard. So please pay attention not to get them wet. (Such like keeping them in high humidity or wet place can occur getting them wet.)   \n\n"}]
