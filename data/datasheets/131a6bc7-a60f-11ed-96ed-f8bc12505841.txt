The ADP3330 \nstands out from the conventional LDOs with a novel architecture  \nand an enhanced process that enables it to offer performance \nadvantages and higher output current than its competition.  Its \npatented design requires only a  minimum output capacitor of  \n0.47 µF for stability. This device is  insensitive to output capacitor \nequivalent series resistance (ESR), and is stable with any good \nquality capacitor, including  ceramic (MLCC) types for space \nrestricted applications. The ADP3330 achieves exceptional \naccuracy of ± 0.7% at room temperature and ± 1.4% over \ntemperature, line and load variations. The dropout voltage of \nthe ADP3330 is only 140 mV (typical) at 200 mA . This  device also \nincludes a safety current limit, thermal overload protection , and \na shutdown feature. In shutdown mode, the ground cu rrent is reduced to less than 2  µA. The ADP3330 has an ultralow \nground  current  34 µA (typ ical) in light load situations.  \nThe 6-lead SOT -23 package has been thermall y enhanced using  \nAnalog Devices  proprie tary chip -on-lead feature to maximize  \npower dissipation.   \n \nFigure 2.

C | Page 9 of 16 \nADP3330 Data Sheet \n \nTHEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe anyCAP  low dropout ( LDO)  ADP3330 uses a single control \nloop for  regulation and reference functions. The output voltage \nis sensed  by a resistive voltage divider consisting of R1 and R2 , \nwhich is  varied  to provide the available output voltage options. \nFeedback  is taken from this network by way of a series diode \n(D1) and a  second resistor divider (R3 and R4) to the input of \nan amplifier.  \n \nFigure 22. Functional Block Diagram  \nA very high gain error amplifier is used to control this loop. The \namplifier is constructed in such a way that , at equilibrium , the \namplifier produces a large, temperature proportional input \noffset voltage that is repeatable and very well controlled. The \ntemp erature proportional offset voltage is combined with the \ncomplementary diode voltage to form a virtual band  gap \nvoltage, implicit in the network, although it never appears \nexplicitly in the circuit. Ultimately, this patented design makes it possible to con trol the loop with only one amplifier. This \ntechnique also improves the noise characteristics of the amplifier by providing more flexibility on the trade -off of noise \nsources that leads to a low noise design.   \nThe R1, R2 divider is chosen in the same ratio  as the band  gap \nvoltage to the output voltage. Although the R1, R2 resistor divider is loaded by the D1  diode  and a second divider \nconsisting of R3 and R4, the values are chosen to produce a \ntemperature stable output. This unique arrangement specifically \ncorrects the loading of the divider so that the typical error \nresulting from base current loading in conventional circuits is \navoided.  The patented amplifier controls a new  and unique noninverting \ndriver  that dr ives the pass transistor, Q1. The use of this  \nnoninverting driver enables the frequency compensation to \ninclude the load capacitor in a pole splitting arrangement to \nachieve reduced sensitivity to the value, type, and ESR of the \nload capacitance.  \nMost LDOs  place strict requirements on the range of ESR values \nfor the output capacitor because they are difficult to stabilize , \ndue to the uncertainty of load capacitance and resistance. \nMoreover, the ESR value required to keep conventional LDOs \nstable changes dep ending on load and temperature. These ESR \nlimitations make designing with LDOs more difficult because of \ntheir unclear specifications and extreme variations over \ntemperature.  \nThe ADP3330 anyCAP LDO overcome s these limitations . It can \nbe used with virtually any good quality capacitor, with no \nconstraint on the minimum ESR. The innovative design  allows  \nthe circuit to be stable with just a small 0.47 µ F capacitor on the \noutput. Additional advantages  of the pole splitting scheme \ninclude superior line noise rejection  and very high regulator \ngain , which leads to excellent line and load regulation. An \nimpressive ±1.4% accuracy is guaranteed over line, load and \ntemperature.  \nAdditional features of the circ uit include current limit, thermal \nshutdown , and noise reduction. Compared to standard \nsolutions that give warning after the output has lost regulation, the ADP3330 provides improved system perf ormance by \nenabling the \nERR  pin to give warning just before the device \nloses regulation. \nWhen  the temperature of the chip rises to more than  165° C, the \ncircuit activates a soft thermal shutdown, indicated by a signal \nlow on the ERR  pin, to reduce the current to a safe level.   \n \n \n \n PTAT\nVOSgmNONINVERTING\nWIDEBAND\nDRIVERINPUT\nQ1\nADP3330COMPENSATION\nCAPACITORR1\nD1\nR2R3\nR4OUTPUT\nPTAT\nCURRENTRLOADCLOAD(a)\nGNDATTENUATION\n(VBAND GAP /VOUT)\n12098-022\nRev. C | Page 10 of 16 \nData Sheet ADP3330 \n \nAPPLICATIONS  INFORMATION  \nCAPACITOR SELECTION  \nOutput Capacitors  \nAs with any micropower  device, output transient response is a \nfunction of the output capacitance. The ADP3330 is stable with \na wide range of capacitor values, types , and ESR (anyCAP). A \ncapacitor as low as 0.47 µ F is all that is needed for stability; \nlarger capacitors can be used if high output current surges are \nanticipated. The ADP3330 is stable with extremely low ESR \ncapacitors (ESR ≈  0), such as MLCC or  OSCON. Note that the \neffective capacitance of some capacitor types may fall less than  \nthe minimum at cold temperature. Ensure that the capacitor \nprovides more than 0.47 µ F at minimum temperature.  \nInput Bypass Capacitor  \nAn input bypass capacitor is not strictly required , but it is \nadvisable in any application involving long input wires or high \nsource impedance. Connecting a 0.47 µ F capacitor from IN  to \nGND  reduces the sensitivity  of the circuit  to printed circuit \nboard (PCB) layout. If a larger value out put capacitor is used, a \nlarger value input capacitor is also recommended.  \nNOISE REDUCTION  \nA noise reduction capacitor ( CNR) can be used to f urther reduce \nthe noise by 6 dB to 10 dB ( see Figure 23). Low leakage \ncapacitors in the 10 pF to 500 pF range provide the best \nperformance. Carefully connect to this node  to avoid noise \npickup from external sources  because the noise reduction pin \n(NR) is internally con nected to a high impedance node . The \npad connected to this pin must be as small as possible and long \nPCB  traces  are not recommended . \nWhen adding a noise reduction capacitor, use the following guidelines:  \n• Maintain a minimum load current of 1 mA when not in \nshutdown.  \n• For C\nNR values greater than 500 pF, add a 100 k Ω series \nresistor (R NR).  \nIt is important to note that as C NR increases, the turn on time is  \ndelayed. W hen CNR values are greate r than 1 nF, this delay may \nbe in the order of several milliseconds.  \n \nFigure 23. Noise Reduction Circuit  \n CHIP -ON-LEAD PACKAGE  \nThe ADP3330 uses a Chip -on-Lead package design  (protected \nby U.S. Patent 5929514 A)  to ensure the best thermal performance \nin the 6 -lead SOT -23 footprint. In a standard 6 -lead SOT -23 \npackage , the majority of the heat flows out of the ground pin. \nThe Chip -on-Lead package uses an electrically  isolated die \nattachment  that allows all pins to  contribute to the heat \nconduction. This technique reduces the thermal resistance to 190° C/W on a 2 -layer board as compared to >230 °C/W for a \nstandard SOT -23 lead  frame. Figure 24 and Figure 25 show the \ndifference between the standard 6 -lead SOT -23 and the Chip -on-\nLead lead frames.  \n \nFigure 24. Normal 6-Lead SOT- 23 Package  \n \nFigure 25. Thermally Enhanced , Chip -on-Lead Package  \nTHERMAL OVERLOAD PRO TECTION  \nThe ADP3330 is protected  against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by its thermal overload protection circuit , \nwhich limits the die temperature to a maximum of 165 °C. \nUnder extreme conditions , (that is,  high ambient temperature \nand power dissipation) where die temperature starts to rise \nmore than  165° C, the output current decreases until the die \ntemperature has dropped to a safe level. The output current is \nrestored when the die temperature is reduced.  \nCurrent and thermal limit protections protect the device against \naccide ntal overload conditions. For normal operation, device \npower dissipation must  be externally limited so  that the \njunction temperatures do  not exceed 125° C. \n \n \n \n \n   \n VIN\n+\n–C1\n0.47µFVOUT = 3.3VNR\nOUT\nGNDIN\nC2\n0.47µF+\n–ERR\nSDR1\n330kΩCNR\nRNRADP3330-3\n12098-023SILICON\nDIE\n12098-024\nSILICON DIE WITH\nELECTRICALLY\nISOLATED\nDIE ATTACH\n12098-025\nRev. C | Page 11 of 16 \nADP3330 Data Sheet \n \nCALCULATING JUNCTION  TEMPERATURE  \nDevice power dissipation is calculated as follows: \nPD = (V IN − VOUT) ILOAD + (VIN) IGND \nwhere:   \nILOAD and IGND are load current and ground current . \nVIN and VOUT are input and output voltages , respectively.  \nAssuming ILOAD = 200 mA, I GND = 4 mA, V IN = 4.2 V , and VOUT = \n3.0 V,  the device power dissipation is  the following :  \nPD = (4.2 −  3.0) 200 mA + 4.2 (4 mA) = 257 mW  \nThe proprietary package used in the ADP3330 has a thermal \nresistance of 165 °C/W , significantly lower than the standard  \n6-lead SOT -23 package. Assuming a 4 -layer board, the junction \ntemperature rise above ambient temperature is  approximately \nequal to   \nΔTJA = 0.257 W  × 165° C/W = 42.4 °C \nTo limit the maximum junction temperature to 125 °C, \nmaximum allowable ambient temperature is  \nTA MAX  = 125° C − 42.4° C = 82.6 °C \nPRINTED CIRCUIT BOAR D (PCB) LAYOUT \nCONSIDERATIONS  \nAll packages rely  on the traces of the PC B to conduct heat away \nfrom the package.  \nIn standard packages , the dominant component of the heat \nresistance path is the plastic between the die attach pad and the \nindividual leads. In typical thermally enhanced packages , one or \nmore of the leads are fused to the die attach pad, significantly  \ndecreasing this component. To make the improvement  \nmeaningful , however, a significant copper area o n the PCB must \nbe attached to these fused pins.  \nThe patented chip -on-lead frame design of the ADP3330 \nuniformly minimizes the value of the dominant portion of the \nthermal resistance. It ensures that heat is conducted away by all \nof the package  pins and  yields a very low 165 °C/W thermal  \nresistance for the 6 -lead SOT -23 package . Low thermal \nresistance is achieved  without any special board layout \nrequirements, just the normal traces connected to the leads , and \nyields a 17% improvement in heat dissipation capability as \ncompared to a standard 6 -lead SOT -23 package. The thermal \nresistance can be decreased by approxima tely an additional 10% \nby attaching a few square cm of copper area to the V IN pin of the \nADP33 30 package.   \nIt is not recommended to use  solder mask or silkscreen on the \nPCB traces adjacent to th e pins of the ADP3330 because it \nincreases the junction to ambient thermal resistance of the \npackage.  \n ERROR FLAG DROPOUT D ETECTOR  \nThe ADP3330 maintain s its output voltage over a wide range of \nload, input voltag e, and temperature conditions. If the output is \nabout to lose regulation by reducing the supply voltage less than  \nthe combined regulated output and dropout voltages, the ERR  \nflag is activated. The ERR  output is an open collector  that is \ndriven low.  \nWhe n the ERR  output  is set, the hysteresis of the ERR  flag keep s \nthe output low until a small margin of the operating range is \nrestored either by raising the supply voltage or reducing the load.   \nSHUTDOWN MODE  \nApplying a TTL high signal to the shutdown ( SD) pin, or tying \nthe SD pin to the input pin, turn s the output on . Pulling the SD \npin down to 0.4 V or below, or tying the SD pin to grou nd, \nturns  the output off (we do not do all caps for emphasis) . In \nshutdown mode, the ground  current is reduced to much less \nthan 1 µ A. \nLOW POWER, LO W DROPOUT APPLICATIO NS \nThe ADP3330 is well suited for applications such as cell phone \nhandsets that require low ground  current and low dropout \nvoltage features. The ADP3330 typically draws 34 µ A under \nlight load situations (that is , load current = 100  µA), which \nresults in low power consumption when the cell  phone is in \nstandby mode.  \nFigure 26 shows an application in which the ADP3330 is used \nin a handset to provide 2.75 V nominal output voltage. The cell \nphone is powere d from a 3 cell NiCd or 1 cell Li -Ion battery. \nThe ADP3330 guarantees an accuracy of 1.4%, even when the \ninput/output differential is merely 250 mV (worst case). \nTherefore, the voltage output is  regulated  and within \nspecification even when the battery voltage has reached it s end \nof discharge voltage of 3 V . The output voltage never falls less \nthan  2.7 V , even under worst case load and temperature \nconditions. The low dropout feature coupled with t he high \naccuracy of the ADP3330 ensures that the system is reliably \npowered until the end of the life of the battery, which results in increased system talk time.  \n \nFigure 26.
