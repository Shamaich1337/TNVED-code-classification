While these die ca pabilities represent a major\nadvance over what was available just a few years ago, it isimportant for power MOSFET pa ckaging technology to keep\npace. It should be obvious that degradation of a highperformance die by the packag e is undesirable. PowerPAK\nis a new package technology that addresses these issues.\nIn this application note, PowerPAK’s construction isdescribed. Following this mo unting information is presented\nincluding land patterns and soldering profiles for maximumreliability. Finally, thermal and electrical performance is\ndiscussed.\nTHE PowerPAK PACKAGE\nThe PowerPAK package was developed around the SO-8package (figure 1). The PowerPAK SO-8 utilizes the samefootprint and the same pin-outs  as the standard SO-8. This\nallows PowerPAK to be substi tuted directly for a standard\nSO-8 package. Being a leadless package, PowerPAK SO-8utilizes the entire SO-8 footprint, freeing space normallyoccupied by the leads, and thus allowing it to hold a largerdie than a standard SO-8. In fact , this larger die is slightly\nlarger than a full sized DPAK die. The bottom of the dieattach pad is exposed for the purpose of providing a direct,\nlow resistance thermal path to the substrate the device ismounted on. Finally, the packag e height is lower than the\nstandard SO-8, making it an excellent choice forapplications with space constraints.\n Fig. 1    PowerPAK 1212 DevicesPowerPAK SO-8 SINGLE MOUNTING\nThe PowerPAK single is simple to use. The pin arrangement(drain, source, gate pins) and the pin dimensions are thesame as standard SO-8 devices (s ee figure 2). Therefore, the\nPowerPAK connection pads matc h directly to those of the\nSO-8. The only difference is the extended drain connectionarea. To take immediate advantage of the PowerPAK SO-8single devices, they can be mounted to existing SO-8 landpatterns.\n Fig. 2 \nThe minimum land pattern recommended to take full\nadvantage of the PowerPAK  thermal performance see\nApplication Note 826, Recommended Minimum Pad\nPatterns With Outline Drawin g Access for Vishay Siliconix\nMOSFETs . Click on the PowerPAK SO-8 single in the index\nof this document.In this figure, the drain land pattern is given to make full\ncontact to the drain pad on the PowerPAK package.This land pattern can be extended to the left, right, and topof the drawn pattern. This ex tension will serve to increase\nthe heat dissipation by decreasing the thermal resistancefrom the foot of the PowerPAK to the PC board andtherefore to the ambient. Note  that increasing the drain land\narea beyond a certain point will yield little decreasein foot-to-board and foot-to- ambient thermal resistance.\nUnder specific conditions of  board configuration, copper\nweight and layer stack, ex periments have found that\nmore than about 0.25 in\n2 to 0.5 in2 of additional copper\n(in addition to the drain land) will yield little improvement in\nthermal performance.\nStandard SO-8 Po werPAK SO-8\n\nPowerPAK® SO-8 Mounting and Thermal ConsiderationsAPPLICATION NOTEApplication Note AN821\nwww.vishay.comVishay Siliconix\n \nRevision: 16-Mai-13 2 Document Number: 71622\nFor technical questions, contact: powermosfettechsu pport@vishay.com\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

Therefore, the PowerPAKdevice connection pads match di rectly to those of the SO-8.\nAs in the single-channel package, the only exception is theextended drain connection area. Manufacturers can likewisetake immediate advantage of the PowerPAK SO-8 dualdevices by mounting them to existing SO-8 dual landpatterns.To take the advantage of the dual PowerPAK SO-8’sthermal performance, the minimum recommended land\npattern can be found in Application Note 826,Recommended Minimum Pad Patterns With Outline\nDrawing Access for Vishay Siliconix MOSFETs . Click on the\nPowerPAK 1212-8 dual in the index of this document.The gap between the two drain pads is 24 mils. Thismatches the spacing of the two drain pads on thePowerPAK SO-8 dual package.\nREFLOW SOLDERING\nVishay Siliconix surface-mount packages meet solder reflowreliability requirements.

THE PRODUCTS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND THIS DOCUMENT\nARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC DISCLAIMERS, SET FORTH AT www.vishay.com/doc?91000THERMAL PERFORMANCE\nIntroductionA basic measure of a devi ce’s thermal performance\nis the junction-to-case  thermal resistance, R\nthJC, or the\njunction-to-foot th ermal resistance, R thJF This parameter is\nmeasured for the device mounted to an infinite heat sink andis therefore a characterization of the device only, in otherwords, independent of the properties of the object to whichthe device is mounted. Ta ble 1 shows a comparison of\nthe DPAK, PowerPAK SO-8, and standard SO-8. ThePowerPAK has thermal perfo rmance equivalent to the\nDPAK, while having an order of magnitude better thermal\nperformance over the SO-8. \nThermal Performance on Standard SO-8 Pad PatternBecause of the common footprint, a PowerPAK SO-8can be mounted on an existi ng standard SO-8 pad pattern.\nThe question then arises as to the thermal performanceof the PowerPAK device under these conditions. Acharacterization was made co mparing a standard SO-8 and\na PowerPAK device on a board with a trough cut outunderneath the PowerPAK drain pad. This configurationrestricted the heat flow to th e SO-8 land pads. The results\nare shown in figure 5.  \n Fig. 5   PowerPAK SO-8 and Standard SO-0 Land Pad Thermal \nPathBecause of the presence of the trough, this result suggests\na minimum performance improvement of 10 °C/W by usinga PowerPAK SO-8 in a standard SO-8 PC board mount.  The only concern when mounting a PowerPAK on astandard SO-8 pad pattern is th at there should be no traces\nrunning between the body of the MOSFET. Where thestandard SO-8 body is spaced  away from the pc board,\nallowing traces to run underneath, the PowerPAK sitsdirectly on the pc board.  Thermal Performance - Spreading CopperDesigners may add additional copper, spreading copper, tothe drain pad to aid in conducti ng heat from a device. It is\nhelpful to have some information about the thermalperformance for a given area  of spreading copper.  \nFigure 6 shows the thermal resistance of a PowerPAK SO-8device mounted on a 2-in. 2-in., four-layer FR-4 PC board.The two internal layers and the backside layer are solid\ncopper. The internal layers we re chosen as solid copper to\nmodel the large power and gr ound planes common in many\napplications. The top layer was cut back to a smaller areaand at each step junction-to-ambient thermal resistancemeasurements were taken. The results indicate that an areaabove 0.3 to 0.4 square inches of spreading copper gives noadditional thermal performance improvement. Asubsequent experiment was run where the copper on theback-side was reduced, first to  50 % in stripes to mimic\ncircuit traces, and then totally removed. No significant effectwas observed.\n Fig. 6   Spreading Copper Juncti on-to-Ambient PerformanceTABLE 1 - DPAK AND POWERPAK SO-8EQUIVALENT STEADY STATE PERFORMANCE\nDPAK  PowerPAK\nSO-8 Standard\nSO-8\n  Thermal \nResistance R thJC1.2 °C/W 1 °C/W 16 °C/W\nSi4874DY vs. Si7446DP PPAK on a 4-Layer Board\nSO-8 Pattern, Tro ugh Under Drain\nPulse D uration (sec))sttaw/C( ecnadepmI\n0.00010\n15060\n10\n10000 0.0140\n20\nSi4874DY\nSi7446DP\n10030Rth vs. Spreading Copper\n(0 %, 50 %, 100 % Back Copper)\nSpreading Copper (sq in))sttaw/C( ecnadepmI\n0.0056\n51\n46\n41\n36\n0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00\n0 %\n50 %100 %\nPowerPAK® SO-8 Mounting and Thermal ConsiderationsAPPLICATION NOTEApplication Note AN821\nwww.vishay.comVishay Siliconix\n \nRevision: 16-Mai-13 4 Document Number: 71622\nFor technical questions, contact: powermosfettechsu pport@vishay.com\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

This self-heating raises thejunction temperature  of the device above that of the PC\nboard to which it is mounted, causing increased powerdissipation in the de vice. A major source of this problem lies\nin the large values of the junction-to-foot thermal resistanceof the SO-8 package.PowerPAK SO-8 minimizes th e junction-to-board thermal\nresistance to where the MOSFET die temperature is veryclose to the temperature of the PC board. Consider twodevices mounted on a PC board heated to 105 °C by other\ncomponents on the board (figure 8).\n Fig. 8   Temperature of Devices on a PC BoardSuppose each device is di ssipating 2.7 W. Using the\njunction-to-foot thermal resistance characteristics of thePowerPAK SO-8 and the standard SO-8, the dietemperature is determined to be 107 °C for the PowerPAK(and for DPAK) and 148 °C for the standard SO-8. This is a\n2 °C rise above the board temperature for the PowerPAKand a 43 °C rise for the standard  SO-8. Referring to figure 7,\na 2 °C difference has minimal effect on R\nDS(on)  whereas a\n43 °C difference has a significant effect on R DS(on) . \nMinimizing the thermal rise above the board temperature by\nusing PowerPAK has not only eased the thermal design but\nit has allowed the device to run cooler, keep r DS(on)  low, and\npermits the device to handle  more current than the same\nMOSFET die in the standard SO-8 package.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPowerPAK SO-8 has been show n to have the same thermal\nperformance as the DPAK pa ckage while having the same\nfootprint as the standard SO -8 package. The PowerPAK\nSO-8 can hold larger die approximately equal in size to themaximum that the DPAK ca n accommodate implying no\nsacrifice in performance beca use of package limitations. \nRecommended PowerPAK SO-8 land patterns are providedto aid in PC board layout for designs using this new\npackage.Thermal considerations have indicated that significantadvantages can be gained by using PowerPAK SO-8devices in designs where the PC board was laid out for\nthe standard SO-8. Applicatio ns experimental data gave\nthermal performance data  showing minimum and\ntypical thermal performance in  a SO-8 environment, plus\ninformation on the opti mum thermal performance\nobtainable including spread ing copper. This further\nemphasized the DPAK equivalency. PowerPAK SO-8 therefore has the desired small sizecharacteristics of the SO-8 combined with the attractive\nthermal characteristics of the DPAK package. 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 \n-50 -25 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 V GS  = 10 V \nI D  = 23   A On-Resistance vs. Junction Temperat ure \nT J - Junction Temperat ure (°C) )dezilamroN( ( ecnatsiseR-nO  - R)no(SD)\n0.8 °C/W107 °CPowerPAK SO-8\n16 C/W148 °CStandard SO-8\nPC Board at 105 °C\nApplication Note 826\nVishay Siliconix\n \n \nDocument Number: 72599 www.vishay.com\nRevision: 21-Jan-08 15\nAPPLICATION NOTERECOMMENDED MINIMUM PADS FOR PowerPAK® SO-8 Single\n0.174\n(4.42)\nRecommended Mi nimum Pads\nDimensions in Inches/(mm)0.260\n(6.61)\n0.024\n(0.61)\n0.154\n(3.91)0.150\n(3.81)0.050\n(1.27)\n0.050\n(1.27)0.032\n(0.82)0.040\n(1.02)0.026\n(0.66)\nReturn to Index\nReturn to Index\nLegal Disclaimer Notice\nwww.vishay.comVishay  \n \nRevision: 01-Jan-2019 1 Document Number: 91000Disclaimer\n ALL PRODUCT, PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS AND DATA AR E SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITH OUT NOTICE TO IMPROVE  \nRELIABILITY, FUNCTION OR DESIGN OR OTHERWISE.
