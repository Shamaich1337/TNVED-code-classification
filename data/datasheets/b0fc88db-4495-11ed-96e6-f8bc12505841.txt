It is optimized for switching the WLAN −SIM data and\ncontrol signals and dedicates one channel as a supply −source switch.\nThe FSA2567 is compatible with the requirements of SIM cards and\nfeatures a low on capacitance (C ON) of 10 pF to ensure high −speed\ndata transfer. The V SIM switch path has a low R ON characteristic to\nensure minimal voltage drop in the dual SI M card supply paths.\nThe FSA2567 contains special circuitry that minimizes current\nconsumption when the control voltage applied to the SEL pin is lower\nthan the supply voltage (V CC). This feature is especially valuable in\nultra−portable applications, such as cell phones; allowing direct\ninterface with the general −purpose I/Os of the baseband processor.\nOther applications include switching and connector sharing in\nportable cell phones, PDAs, digital cameras, printers, and notebook\ncomputers.\nFeatures\n•Low On Capacitance for Data Path: 10 pF Typical\n•Low On Resistance for Data Path: 6 /C0087 Typical\n•Low On Resistance for S upply Path: 0.4 /C0087 Typical\n•Wide V CC Operating Range: 1.65 V to 4.3 V\n•Low Power Consumption: 1 /C0109A Maximum\n♦15 /C0109A Maximum I CCT Over Expanded V oltage Range \n(VIN = 1.8 V, V CC = 4.3 V)\n•Wide −3 db Bandwidth: >160 MHz\n•Packaged in:\n♦Pb−free 16−Lead MLP & 16 −Lead UMLP\n•3 kV ESD Rating, >12 kV Power/GND ESD Rating\nApplications\n•Cell Phone, PDA, Digital Camera, and Note book\n•LCD Monitor, TV , and Set −Top BoxMARKING DIAGRAM\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information on page 2 of\nthis data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATIONWQFN16 3x3, 0.5P\nCASE 510BS\nUQFN16 1.8x2.6, 0.4P\nCASE 523BF\n$Y&Z&2&K\nFSA\n2567GX&K\n&2&Z\nGX, FSA2567 = Device Code\n$Y = onsemi  Logo\n&Z = Assembly Plant Code&2 = 2 −Digit Date Code\n&K = 2 −Digits Lot Run Traceability Code\nFSA2567\nwww. onsemi.com\n2ORDERING INFORMATION\nPart Number Top MarkOperating \nTemperature Range Package Shipping†\nFSA2567MPX FSA2567 −40 to +85 °C 16−Lead, Molded Leadless Package (MLP)\nQuad, JEDEC MO −220, 3 mm Square3000 / Tape & Reel\nFSA2567UMX GX 16−Lead, Quad, Ultrathin Molded Leadless\nPackage (UMLP), 1.8 x 2.6 mm5000 / Tape & Reel\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging\nSpecifications Brochure, BRD8011/D.\nFigure 1.
