By executing powerf ul instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmega8 achieves\nthroughputs approaching 1MIPS per MHz, allowing the system designer to optimize power con-sumption versus processing speed.\nBlock Diagram Figure 1.

The\nresulting architecture is more code efficient wh ile achieving throughputs up to ten times faster\nthan conventional CISC microcontrollers.\nThe ATmega8 provides the following features: 8 Kbytes of In-System Programmable Flash with\nRead-While-Write capabilities, 512 bytes of EEPROM, 1 Kbyte of SRAM, 23 general purposeI/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible Timer/Counters with compare\nmodes, internal and external interrupts, a seri al programmable USART, a byte oriented Two-\nwire Serial Interface, a 6-channel ADC (eight channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages) with10-bit accuracy, a programmable Watchdog Timer with Internal Os cillator, an SPI serial port,\nand five software selectable power saving modes. The Idle mode stops the CPU while allowingthe SRAM, Timer/Counters, SPI port, and interr upt system to continue functioning. The Power-\ndown mode saves the register contents but freezes the Oscillator, disabling all other chip func-\ntions until the next Interrupt or Hardware Reset. In Power-save mode, the asynchronous timercontinues to run, allowing the user to maintain a timer base while the rest of the device is sleep-ing. The ADC Noise Reduction mode stops the CPU and all I/O modules except asynchronous\ntimer and ADC, to minimize switching noise  during ADC conversions. In Standby mode, the\ncrystal/resonator Oscillator is running while the re st of the device is sleeping. This allows very\nfast start-up combined with low-power consumption.\nThe device is manufactured using Atmel’s high density non-volatile memory technology. The\nFlash Program memory can be reprogrammed In-System through an SPI serial interface, by aconventional non-volatile memory programmer, or by an On-chip boot program running on theAVR core. The boot program can use any interface to download the application program in theApplication Flash memory . Software in the Boot Flash Sect ion will continue to run while the\nApplication Flash Section is updated, providi ng true Read-While-Write operation. By combining\nan 8-bit RISC CPU with In-System Self-Programmable Flash on a monolithic chip, the AtmelATmega8 is a powerful microcontroller that provides a highly-flexible and cost-effective solutionto many embedded control applications.\nThe ATmega8 is supported with a full suite of program and system development tools, including\nC compilers, macro assemblers, program simulators, and evaluation kits.\nDisclaimer Typical values contained in this datasheet ar e based on simulations and characterization of\nother AVR microcontrollers manufactured on t he same process technology.

Note that the electrical char-\nacteristics of PC6 differ from those of the other pins of Port C.\nIf the RSTDISBL Fuse is unprogrammed, PC6 is used as a Reset input. A low level on this pin\nfor longer than the minimum pulse length will generate a Reset, even if the clock is not running.\nThe minimum pulse length is given in Table 15 on page 38 . Shorter pulses are not guaranteed to\ngenerate a Reset.\nThe various special features of Port C are elaborated on page 61 .\nPort D (PD7..PD0) Port D is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit).
