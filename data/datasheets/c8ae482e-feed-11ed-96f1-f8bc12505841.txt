It complies wit h applicable requirements of IEEE 802.3. It directly \ndrives either a 100BASE- TX line or a 10BASE-T line.\nNote: The LXT971A PHY also suppor ts 100BASE-FX operation th rough an LVPECL interface.\n5.1.1 Comprehensive Functionality\nThe LXT971A PHY provides a standard Media Independent Interface (MII) for 10/100 MACs. The LXT971A PHY performs all function s of the Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) \nand Physical Media Attachment (PMA) sublayer as defined in the IEEE 802.3 100BASE-X \nstandard. It also performs all functions of th e Physical Media Dependent (PMD) sublayer for \n100BASE-TX connections.\nThe LXT971A PHY reads its configuration pins on power-up to check for forced operation \nsettings.\nIf the LXT971A PHY is not set for forced operation, it uses auto-negotiation/parallel \ndetection to automatically determine line ope rating conditions. If the PHY device on the \nother side of the link supports auto-negotiati on, the LXT971A PHY auto-negotiates with it \nusing Fast Link Pulse (FLP) Bursts. If the PH Y partner does not support auto-negotiation, \nthe LXT971A PHY automatically detects the pres ence of either link pulses (10 Mbps PHY) \nor Idle symbols (100 Mbps PHY) and sets its operating conditions accordingly.The LXT971A PHY provides half-duplex and full-duplex operation at 100 Mbps and \n10 Mbps.\n5.1.2 Optimal Signal Processing Architecture\nThe LXT971A PHY incorporates high-efficiency Optimal Signal Processing (OSP) design \ntechniques, which combine optimal properties of digital and analog signal processing.\nThe receiver utilizes decision feedback equa lization to increase noise and cross-talk \nimmunity by as much as 3 dB over an ideal all-analog equalizer. Using OSP mixed-signal \nprocessing techniques in the receive equalizer avoids the quantization noise and \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 26 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.2  Network Media / Protocol\nSupport\ncalculation truncation errors found in tradit ional DSP-based receiver s (typically complex \nDSP engines with A/D converters). This results in improved receiver noise and cross-talk \nperformance.\nThe OSP signal processing scheme also requires substantially less computational logic \nthan traditional DSP-based desi gns. This lowers power cons umption and also reduces the \nlogic switching noise generated by DSP engines. This logic switching noise can be a considerable source of EMI generated on the device’s power supplies.\nThe OSP-based LXT971A PHY provides improved data recovery, EMI performance, and \nlow power consumption. \n5.2 Network Media / Protocol Support\nThis section includes the following:\n•Section 5.2.1, 10/100 Network Interface\n•Section 5.2.2, MII Data Interface\n•Section 5.2.3, Configuration Management Interface\nThe LXT971A PHY supports bo th 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX Ethernet over tw isted-pair \nor 100 Mbps Ethernet over  fiber media (100BASE-FX).\n5.2.1 10/100 Network Interface\nThe network interface port consists of five exte rnal pins (two differential signal pairs and a \nsignal detect pin). The I/O pins are shared betwe en twisted-pair (TP) and fiber. For specific \npin assignments, see Section 4.0, Signal Descriptions , on page 19 .\nThe LXT971A PHY output drivers can generate one of the following outputs:\n• 100BASE-TX\n• 10BASE-T\n• 100BASE-FX\nWhen not transmitting data, the LXT971A PHY generates IEEE 802.3-compliant link pulses \nor idle code. Depending on the mode selected, input signals are decoded as one of the \nfollowing:\n• 100BASE-TX\n• 10BASE-T• 100BASE-FX\nAuto-negotiation/parallel detection or manual control is used to determine the speed of this \ninterface.\n5.2.1.1 Twisted-Pair Interface\nThe LXT971A PHY supports either 100BASE- TX or 10BASE-T connections over 100 \uf057\uf02c\uf020\nCategory 5 \uf02c\uf020Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cable. When operating at 100 Mbps, the \nLXT971A PHY continuously transmits and rece ives MLT3 symbols. When not transmitting \ndata, the LXT971A PHY generates “IDLE” symbols. \nDuring 10 Mbps operation, Xilink* Manchester-encoded data is exchanged. When no data \nis being exchanged, the line is left in an idle st ate. Link pulses are tr ansmitted periodically to \nkeep the link up.\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 27 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.2  Network Media / Protocol\nSupport\nOnly a transformer, RJ-45 connector, load resi stor and bypass capacitors are required to \ncomplete this interface. On the transmit si de, the LXT971A PHY has an active internal \ntermination and does not require external termination resistors. Cortina’s waveshaping \ntechnology shapes the outgoing signal to help reduce the need for external EMI filters. Four \nslew rate settings allow the designer to match the output waveform to the magnetic \ncharacteristics. On the receive side, the internal impedance is high enough that it has no \npractical effect on the external terminati on circuit. (For the slew rate settings, see Table 62, \nTransmit Control Register - Address 30, Hex 1E , on page 89 .)\n5.2.1.2 Fiber Interface\nThe LXT971A PHY fiber port is designed to in terface with common industry-standard fiber \nmodules. It incorporat es an LVPECL interface that complies with the ANSI X3.166 standard \nfor seamless integration.\nFiber mode is selected through register bit 16.0 by the following two methods:\n1. Drive the SD input to a value greater than 600 mV during power-up and reset states (all \nLVPECL signaling levels from a fiber PHY are acceptable).\n2. Configure register bit 16.0 = 1 through the MDIO interface.\n5.2.1.3 Remote Fault Detection and Reporting\nThe LXT971A PHY supports two remote f ault detection and reporting mechanisms. \n• “Remote Fault” refers to a MAC-to-MAC communication functi on that is transparent to \nPHY layer devices. It is used only during auto -negotiation, and is applicable only to \ntwisted-pair links.\n• “Far-End Fault” is an optional PMA-layer function that may be embedded within PHY \ndevices.\nRemote Fault Detection.  register bit 4.13 in the Auto-N egotiation Advertisement Register \nis reserved for Remote Faul t indications. It is typically used when re-starting the \nauto-negotiation sequence to indicate to the link partner that the link is down because the \nadvertising device detected a local fault.\nWhen the LXT971A PHY receives a Remote Fault indication from its partner during \nauto-negotiation, the following occurs:\n• register bit 5.13 in the Link Part ner Base Page Ability Register is set.\n• Remote Fault register bit 1.4 in the MII Status  Register is set to pa ss this information to \nthe local controller.\n100BASE-FX Far-End Fault Indication.  The LXT971A PHY independently detects signal \nfaults from the local fiber PHYs through t he SD/TP_L pin. The LXT971A PHY also uses \nregister bit 1.4 to report Remote Fault indications received from its link partner. The \nLXT971A PHY ORs both fault conditions to set bi t 1.4 to ‘1’. register bit 1.4 is set once and \nclears to ‘0’ when it is read. In fiber operat ions, the far-end fault detection process requires \nidles to establish link. Link does not establish if a far-end fault pattern is the initial signal detected.\nEither fault condition causes the LXT971A PHY to drop the link unless Forced Link Pass is \nselected by setting register bit 16.14 to ‘1’. A ‘link is down’ condition is th en reported with \ninterrupts and status bits.\nIn response to locally detected signal faults (that is, the SD/TP_L pi n is activated by the \nlocal fiber PHY), the affected port can transmit the far-end fault code if the fault code \ntransmission is enabled by register bit 16.2.\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 28 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.2  Network Media / Protocol\nSupport\n• When register bit 16.2 = 0, the LXT971A PHY does not transmit far end fault code. It \ncontinues to transmit idle code and may or may not drop link depending on the setting \nfor register bit 16.14.\n• When register bit 16.2 = 1, transmission of the far end fault code is enabled. The \nLXT971A PHY transmits far end fault code if fault conditions are detected by the \nSD/TP_L pin.\nThe occurrence of a Far End Fault causes all transmission of data from the Reconciliation \nSublayer to stop and the Far End fault code to  begin. The Far End Fault code consists of 84 \nones followed by a single zero. (This pattern must be repeated three times.)\nIf the LXT971A PHY detects a signal fault condition, it can transmit the Far-End Fault Indication (FEFI) over the fiber link. The FEFI  consists of 84 consec utive ones followed by a \nsingle zero. This pattern must be repeated at least three times. The LXT971A PHY \ntransmits the far-end fault code a minimum of three times if all the following conditions are \ntrue:\n• Fiber mode is selected.\n• Fault Code transmission is enabled (register bit 16.2 = 1).• Either Signal Detect indicates no si gnal, or the receive PLL cannot lock.\n• Loopback is not enabled.\n5.2.2 MII Data Interface\nThe LXT971A PHY supports a standard Medi a Independent Interface (MII). The MII \nconsists of a data interface and a manageme nt interface. The MII Data Interface passes \ndata between the LXT971A PHY and a Media Access Controller (MAC). Separate parallel \nbuses are provided for transmit and receive. This interface operates at either 10 Mbps or \n100 Mbps. The speed is set automatically, once the operating conditions of the network link \nhave been determined. For details, see Section 5.6, MII Operation , on page 37 .\nIncreased MII Drive Strength.  A higher Media Independent In terface (MII) drive strength \nmay be desired in some designs to drive signals over longer PCB trace lengths, or over \nhigh-capacitive loads, through multiple vias, or through a connector. The MII drive strength \nin the LXT971A PHY can be increased by setting register bit 26.11 through software control. \nSetting register bit 26.11 = 1 through the MDC/ MDIO interface sets the MII pins (RXD[3:0], \nRX_DV, RX_CLK, RX_ER, COL, CRS, and TX_CLK) to a higher drive strength.\n5.2.3 Configuration Ma nagement Interface \nThe LXT971A PHY provides both an MDIO interface and a reduced hardware control interface for device configuration and management.\n5.2.3.1 MDIO Management Interface\nMDIO management interface topics include the following:\n•Section 5.2.3.1.1, MDIO Addressing\n•Section 5.2.3.1.2, MDIO Frame Structure\n•Section 5.2.3.1.3, MII Interrupts\nThe LXT971A PHY supports the IEEE 802.3 MII Management In terface also known as the \nManagement Data Input/ Output (MDIO) Interface. This in terface allows upper-layer devices \nto monitor and control the state of the LXT9 71A PHY. The MDIO interface consists of a \nphysical connection, a specific protocol that runs across the connection, and an internal set \nof addressable registers.\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 29 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.2  Network Media / Protocol\nSupport\nSome registers are required and their functi ons are defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard. \nThe LXT971A PHY also supports additional registers for expanded functionality. The \nLXT971A PHY supports multiple internal register s, each of which is 16 bits wide. Specific \nregister bits are referenced using an “X.Y” not ation, where X is the register number (0-31) \nand Y is the bit number (0-15).\nThe physical interface consists of a data line (MDIO) and clock line (MDC). Operation of this \ninterface is controlled by the MDDIS input pi n. When MDDIS is High, the MDIO read and \nwrite operations are disabled and the Hard ware Control Interface provides primary \nconfiguration control. When MDDIS is Low, the MDIO port is enabled for both read and write \noperations and the Hardware Control Interface is not used.\n5.2.3.1.1 MDIO Addressing\nThe MDIO addressing protocol allows a cont roller to communicate with multiple PHYs.\nPins ADDR[4:0] can be used to determine the PHY device address that is selected.\n5.2.3.1.2 MDIO Frame Structure\nThe physical interface consists of a data line (MDIO) and clock line (MDC). The frame \nstructure is shown in Figure 4  and Figure 5  (Read and Write).\nMDIO Interface timing is given in Section 7.0, Electrical Specifications .\n5.2.3.1.3 MII Interrupts\nFigure 6 shows the MII interrupt logic. The LXT971A PHY provides a hardware interrupt pin \n(MDINT_L) and two dedicated interrupt re gisters, Register 18 and Register 19.\n• Register 18 provides interrupt enable and ma sk functions. Setting register bit 18.1 = 1 \nenables the device to request interrupt via t he MDINT_L pin. An active Low on this pin \nindicates a status change on the LXT971A PHY.

The supply may be either 2.5 V or \n3.3 V. Also, the inputs on the MII interface are tolerant to 5 V signals from the controller on \nthe other side of the MII interface.  For MII I/O characteristics, see Table 24, Digital I/O \nCharacteristics1 - MII Pins , on page 62 .\nNotes: 1. Bring up power supplies as close to the same time as possible.\n2. As a matter of good practice, keep  power supplies as clean as possible.\n5.3.2 Clock Requirements\n5.3.2.1 External Crystal/Oscillator\nThe LXT971A PHY requires a reference clock input that is used to generate transmit signals \nand recover receive signals. It may be provid ed by either of two me thods: by connecting a \ncrystal across the oscillator pins (XI and XO ) with load capacitors, or by connecting an \nexternal clock source to pin XI.\nThe connection of a clock source to the XI pin requires the XO pin to be left open. To \nminimize transmit jitter, Cortina recommends a crystal-based clock instead of a derived \nclock (that is, a PLL-based clock).\nA crystal is typically used in NIC applications. An external 25 MHz clock source, rather than \na crystal, is frequently used in switch app lications. For clock timing requirements, see \nTable 25, I/O Characteristics - REFCLK/XI and XO Pins , on page 63 .\n5.3.2.2 MDIO Clock\nThe MII management channel (MDIO) also requires an external clock.

When auto-negotiation is enabled, \nthe LXT971A PHY begins the auto-negot iation/parallel-detection operation.\n5.4.2 Reduced-Power Modes\nThis section discusses the LXT971A PHY reduced-power modes.\n5.4.2.1 Hardware Power Down\nThe hardware power-down mode is controlle d by the PWRDWN pin. When PWRDWN is \nHigh, the following conditions are true:\n• The LXT971A PHY network port and clock are shut down.\n• All outputs are tristated.\n• All weak pad pull-up and pull-down resistors are disabled.\n• The MDIO registers are not accessible.\n5.4.2.2 Software Power Down\nSoftware power-down control is provided by regist er bit 0.11 in the Control Register. During \nsoft power-down, the following conditions are true:\n• The network port is shut down.• The MDIO registers remain accessible.\n5.4.2.3 Sleep Mode\nThe LXT971A PHY supports a power-saving sleep mode. Sleep mode is enabled when \nSLEEP is asserted via pin 32(LQ FP)/H7(PBGA). The value of pi n 32/H7 can be  overridden \nby register bit 16.6 in managed mode as listed in Table 56, Configuration Register - Address \n16, Hex 10, on page 83 . The LXT971A PHY enters into  sleep mode when SLEEP is \nenabled and no energy is detected on the twisted-pair input for 1 to 3 seconds. (The time is \ncontrolled by register bits 16.4:3 in the Configuration Register, with a default of 3.04 \nseconds.) \nDuring this mode, the LXT971A PHY still responds to managem ent transactions \n(MDC/MDIO). In this mode the power consumptio n is minimized, and the supply current is \nreduced below the maximum value. If the LXT971 A PHY detects activity on the twisted-pair \ninputs, it comes out of the sleep state and checks for link. If no link is detected in from 1 to 3 \nseconds (the time is programmable) it reverts to the low power sleep state.\nNote: Sleep mode is not functional in fiber network applications.\n5.4.3 Reset\nThe LXT971A PHY provides both hardware and software resets, each of which manage \ndifferently the configuration co ntrol of auto-negotiation, spee d, and duplex-mode selection. \nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 34 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.4  Initialization\nFor a software reset, register bit 0.15 = 1. For register bit definitions used for software reset, \nsee Table 46, Control Register - Address 0, Hex 0 , on page 76 . \n• During a software reset, bit settings in Table 50, Auto-Negotiation Advertisement \nRegister - Address 4, Hex 4 , on page 79 are not re-read from the LXT971A PHY \nconfiguration pins. Instead, the bit settings re vert to the values that were read in during \nthe last hardware reset. Therefore, any changes to pin values made since the last \nhardware reset are not detected during a software reset.\n• During a software reset, registers are available for reading. To see when the LXT971A \nPHY has completed reset, the reset bit can be polled (that is, register bit 0.15 = 0).\nFor pin settings used during a hardware reset, see Section 5.4.4, Hardware Configuration \nSettings . During a hardware reset, configuration settings for auto-negotiation and speed are \nread in from pins, and register information is unavailable for 1 ms after de-assertion of the \nreset.\n5.4.4 Hardware Configuration Settings\nThe LXT971A PHY provides a hardware option to  set the initial device  configuration. As \nlisted in Table 13,  the hardware option uses the hardwar e configuration pins, the settings for \nwhich provide control bits.\nAs shown in Figure 8 , the LED drivers can operate as either open-drain or open-source \ncircuits.Table 13 Hardware Configuration Settings \nDesired ModeLED/CFG\nPin \nSettings1Resulting register bit Values\nControl RegisterAuto-Negotiation Advertisement \nRegister\nAuto-Neg.Speed\n(Mbps)D u p l e x 123Auto-\nNeg.\n0.12Speed\n0.13Full- \nDuplex\n0.8100\nBASE-TX \nFull-Duple\nx\n4.8100\nBASE-\nTX\n4.710\nBASE-T \nFull- \nDuplex\n4.610\nBASE-T\n4.5\nDisabled10H a l f LLL\n000\nN/A\nAuto-Negotiation \nAdvertisementFull L L H 0 1\n100Half L H L 1 0\nFull L H H 1 1\nEnabled100 \nOnlyHalf H L L\n110 0 1 0 0\nFull/Half H L H 1 1 1 1 0 0\n10/100Half Only H H L 1 0 0 1 0 1\nFull or Half H H H 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1.

Each burst consists of up to 33 link \npulses spaced 62.5 \uf06ds apart. Odd link pulses (clock pu lses) are always present. Even link \npulses (data pulses) may be absent or present to indicate a ‘0’ or a ‘1’. Each FLP burst \nexchanges 16 bits of data, which are referred to as a “link code word”. All devices that \nsupport auto-n egotiation must implement the “Bas e Page” defined by the IEEE 802.3 \nstandard (Registers 4 and 5).\nThe LXT971A PHY also supports the optional “Next Page” function as listed in Table 53, \nAuto-Negotiation Next Page Transmit Register - Address 7, Hex 7 , on page 82 and \nTable 54, Auto-Negotiation Link Partner Next Page  Receive Register - Address 8, Hex 8 , on \npage 82.\n5.5.1.1 Base Page Exchange\nBy exchanging Base Pages, the LXT971A PHY and its link partner communicate their \ncapabilities to each other. Both sides must receive at least three consecutive identical base \npages for negotiation to continue. Each side identifies the hi ghest common capabilities that \nboth sides support, and each side configures itself accordingly.\n5.5.1.2 Manual Next Page Exchange\n“Next Page Exchange” information is addition al information that exceeds the information \nrequired by Base Page exchange and that is sent by “Next Pages”. The LXT971A PHY fully \nsupports the IEEE 802. 3 standard method of negotiation through the Next Page exchange.Figure 9  Link Establishment Overview \nCheck Value\n0.12Start\nDoneEnable\nAuto-Neg/Parallel Detection\nGo To Forced\nSettingsAttempt Auto-\nNegotiationListen for 10T\nLink PulsesListen for 100TX\nIdle Symbols\nLink Up?NO YESPower-Up, Reset,\nWaking up from\nSleep mode, or\nLink Failure\nDisable\nAuto-Negotiation0.12 = 0 0.12 = 1\nB3476-01\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 37 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.6  MII Operation\nThe Next Page exchange uses Register 7 to s end information and Register 8 to receive it. \nNext Page exchange occurs only if both ends of the link partners advertise their ability to \nexchange Next Pages. register bit 6.1 is used  to make manual next page exchange easier \nfor software. This register bit is cleared when  a new negotiation occurs, preventing the user \nfrom reading an old value in Register 6 and assuming there is valid information in Registers \n5 and 8.\n5.5.1.3 Controlling Auto-Negotiation\nWhen auto-negotiation is controlled by soft ware, Cortina recommends the following steps:\n1. After power-up, power-down, or reset, the power-down recovery time  (specified in \nTable 44, RESET_L Pulse Width and Recovery Timing , on page 75 ) must be exhausted \nbefore proceeding.\n2. Set the Auto-Negotiation Advertisement register bits.\n3. Enable auto-negotiation. (Set MDIO register bit 0.12 = 1.)\n4. To ensure proper operation, enable or restart auto-negotiation as soon as possible after \nwriting to Register 4.\n5.5.2 Parallel Detection\nIn parallel with auto-negotiation, the LXT971A PHY also monitors for 10 Mbps Normal Link \nPulses (NLP) or 100 Mbps Idle symbols. If either symbol is detected, the device \nautomatically reverts to the corresponding speed in half-duplex mode. Parallel detection \nallows the LXT971A PHY to communicate with devices that do not support auto-negotiation.\nWhen parallel detection resolves a link, the lin k must be established in half-duplex mode. \nAccording to IEEE standards, the forced link partner cannot be configured to full-duplex. If \nthe auto-negotiat ion link partner does not advertise half-duplex capability at th e speed of \nthe forced link partner, link is not established. The IEEE Standard prevents full-duplex-to-half-dup lex link connections.\n5.6 MII Operation\nThis section includes the following topics:\n•Section 5.6.1, MII Clocks\n•Section 5.6.2, Transmit Enable\n•Section 5.6.3, Receive Data Valid\n•Section 5.6.4, Carrier Sense\n•Section 5.6.5, Error Signals\n•Section 5.6.6, Collision\n•Section 5.6.7, Loopback\nThe LXT971A PHY implements the Media Independent Interface (MII) as defined by the \nIEEE 802.3 standard. Separate channels are provided for transmitting data from the MAC to \nthe LXT971A PHY (TXD), and for passing data received from the line (RXD) to the MAC. Each channel has its own clock, data bus, and control signals. \nThe following signals are used to pass received data to the MAC:\n•C O L\n•C R S\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 38 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.6  MII Operation\n•R X _ C L K\n•R X _ D V\n•R X _ E R\n• RXD[3:0]\nThe following signals are used to transmit data from the MAC:\n•T X _ C L K• TX_EN\n• TX_ER\n• TXD[3:0]\nThe LXT971A PHY supplies both clock signals as well as separate outputs for carrier sense \nand collision.

Carrier sense is not generated when a pa cket is transmitted and in \nfull-duplex mode.\n.\n5.6.5 Error Signals\nWhen the LXT971A PHY is in 100 Mbps mode and receives an invalid symbol from the \nnetwork, it asserts RX_ER and drives “0101” on the RXD pins.\nWhen the MAC asserts TX_ER, the LXT971A PH Y drives “H” symbols out on the TPFOP/N \npins.\n5.6.6 Collision\nThe LXT971A PHY asserts its collision signal asynchronously to any clock whenever the \nline state is half-duplex and the transmitter an d receiver are active at the same time. \nTable 14  summarizes the conditions for assertion of carrier sense, data loopback, and \ncollision signals.\n5.6.7 Loopback\nThe LXT971A PHY provides the following loopback functions:\n•Section 5.6.7.1, Operational Loopback\n•Section 5.6.7.2, Internal Digital Loopback (Test Loopback)\nFigure 13 shows LXT971A PHY operational and test loopback paths.

Test loop back in this mode is \nenabled by setting register bit 0.14 = 1 and tying the SD input to an LVPECL logic High \nvalue (2.4 V).\nNote: Parallel detection can resolve the PHY configuration.Figure 13 Loopback Paths \nB3392-0210T \nLoopbackDigital \nBlockMII\nTX \nDriver100X \nLoopbackFX \nDriver\nAnalog \nBlockLXT97x PHY\nOperational \nLoopbackTest Loopback\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 42 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.7  100 Mbps Operation\n5.7 100 Mbps Operation \n5.7.1 100BASE-X Network Operations\nDuring 100BASE-X operation, the LXT971A PHY transmits and  receives 5-bit symbols \nacross the network link. \nFigure 14 shows the structure of a standard fram e packet in 100BASE-X mode. When the \nMAC is not actively transmitting data, the LXT9 71A PHY sends out Idle symbols on the line.\nAs Figure 14  shows, the MAC starts each transmission with a preamble pattern. As soon as \nthe LXT971A PHY detects the start of preamble, it transmits a Start-of-Stream Delimiter \n(SSD, symbols J and K) to the network. It then encodes and transmits the rest of the packet, \nincluding the balance of the preamble, the SFD, packet data, and CRC.\nOnce the packet ends, the LXT971A PHY tr ansmits the End-of-Stream Delimiter (ESD, \nsymbols T and R) and then returns to transmitting Idle symbols. \nFor details on the symbols used, see 4B/5B coding listed in Table 15, 4B/5B Coding , on \npage 46 .\nAs shown in Figure 15, in 100BASE-TX mode, the LXT971A  PHY scrambles and transmits \nthe data to the network using MLT-3 line code. MLT-3 signals received from the network are \nde-scrambled, decoded, and sent across the MII to the MAC.Figure 14 100BASE-X Frame Format \nP0 P1 P6 SFD64-Bit Preamble\n(8 Octets)\nStart-of-Frame\nDelimiter (SFD)DA DA SA SADestination and Source\nAddress (6 Octets each)\nL1 L2Packet Length\n(2 Octets)\nD0 D1 DnData Field\n(Pad to minimum packet size)Frame Check Field\n(4 Octets)\nCRC I0InterFrame Gap / Idle Code\n(> 12 Octets)\nReplaced by\n/T/R/ code-groups\nEnd-of-Stream Delimiter (ESD)IFG\nReplaced by\n/J/K/ code-groupsStart-of-StreamDelimiter (SSD)\nB3466-01\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 43 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.7  100 Mbps Operation\nNote: In 100BASE-FX mode, the LXT971 A PHY transmits and receives NRZI signals across the \nLVPECL interface.

Link remains up unless the descrambler receives less than \n16 consecutive idle symbols in any 2 ms period.  This operation filters out small noise hits \nthat may disrupt the link.\nFor short periods, MLT-3 idle waveforms meet  all criteria for 10B ASE-T start delimiters. A \nworking 10BASE-T receive may temporarily indicate link to 100BASE-TX waveforms. \nHowever, the PHY does not bring up a permanent 10 Mbps link.\nThe LXT971A PHY reports link failure through the MII status bits (register bits 1.2 and \n17.10) and interrupt functions. Link failure causes the LXT971A PHY to re-negotiate if \nauto-negotiation is enabled.\n5.7.3.2.2 Link Failure Override\nThe LXT971A PHY normally transmits data packets only if it detects th e link is up. Setting \nregister bit 16.14 = 1 overrides this function, allowing the LXT971A PHY to transmit data packets even when the link is down. This featur e is provided as a transmit diagnostic tool.\nNote: Auto-negotiation must be disabled to transmit data packets in the absence of link. If \nauto-negotiation is enabled, the LXT971A PHY au tomatically transmits FLP bursts if the link \nis down.\nCaution: During normal operation, Cortina does not recommend setting register bit 16.14 for \n100 Mbps receive functions because receive errors may be generated.INVALIDUndefined H 40 0 1 0 0Transmit Error.

An end-of-stream delimiter (ESD) or /T/R \nsymbol pair causes de-assertion of CRS. The PMA layer also de-asserts CRS if IDLE symbols are received without /T/R. However, in  this case RX_ER is asserted for one clock \ncycle when CRS is de-asserted.\nCortina does not recommend using CRS for Inte rframe Gap (IFG) timing for the following \nreasons:\n• CRS de-assertion time is slightly longer t han CRS assertion time. As a result, an IFG \ninterval appears somewhat shorter to the MAC than it actually is on the wire.\n• CRS de-assertion is not aligned with TX_EN de-assertion on transmit loopbacks in \nhalf-duplex mode.\n5.7.3.2.4 Receive Data Valid\nThe LXT971A PHY asserts RX_DV to indicate th at the received data maps to valid symbols. \nIn 100 Mbps operation, RX_DV is acti ve with the first nibble of preamble.\n5.7.3.3 Twisted-Pair Physical  Medium Dependent Sublayer\nThe twisted-pair Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) layer provides signal scrambling and \nde-scrambling functions, line coding and decoding functi ons (MLT-3 for 100BASE-TX, \nManchester for 10BASE-T), as well as receiving, polarity corr ection, and bas eline wander \ncorrection functions.\n5.7.3.3.1 Scrambler/Descrambler\nThe purpose of the scrambler/descrambler is to spread the signal power spectrum and \nfurther reduce EMI using an 11-bit, data-independent polynomial. The receiver automatically decodes the polynomial whenever IDLE symbols are received.\nScrambler Seeding. Once the transmit data (or Idle symbols) are properly encoded, they \nare scrambled to further reduce EMI and to spread the power spectrum using an 11-bit scrambler seed. Five seed bits are determined by the PHY address, and the remaining bits \nare hard coded in the design.\nScrambler Bypass. The scrambler/de-scrambler can be bypassed by setting register bit \n16.12 = 1.The scrambler is automatically by passed when the fiber port is enabled. \nScrambler bypass is provided for diagnostic and test support.\n5.7.3.3.2 Polarity Correction\nThe 100 Mbps twisted pair signaling is not polarity sensitive. As a result, the polarity status \nis not a valid status indicator.\n5.7.3.3.3 Baseline Wander Correction\nThe LXT971A PHY provides a baseline wander correction function for when the LXT971A \nPHY is under network operating conditions. The MLT3 coding scheme used in \n100BASE-TX is by definition “unbalanced”. As a re sult, the average va lue of the signal \nvoltage can “wander” significantly over short ti me intervals (tenths of seconds). This wander \ncan cause receiver errors at long-line lengths  (100 meters) in less robust designs. Exact \ncharacteristics of t he wander are completely data dependent.\nThe LXT971A PHY baseline wander correction characteristics allow the device to recover \nerror-free data while re ceiving worst-case packets  over all cable lengths.\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 49 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.8  10 Mbps Operation\n5.7.3.3.4 Programmable Slew Rate Control \nThe LXT971A PHY device supports a programmable slew-rate mechanism whereby one of \nfour pre-selected slew rates can be used. (For details, see Table 62, Transmit Control \nRegister - Address 30, Hex 1E, on page 89 .) The slew-rate mechanism allows the designer \nto optimize the output wave form to match the characteristics of the magnetics.\nNote: For hardware control of the slew  rate, use the TxSLEW pins.\n5.7.3.4 Fiber PMD Sublayer\nThe LXT971A PHY provides an LVPECL interface for connection to an external 3.3 V or 5 V \nfiber-optic PHY. (The external PHY provides the PMD function for the optical medium.) The \nLXT971A PHY uses a 125 Mbaud NRZI format for the fiber interface and does not support \n10BASE-FL applications.\n5.8 10 Mbps Operation \nThe LXT971A PHY operates as a standard  10BASE-T PHY and LXT971A PHY supports \nstandard 10 Mbps functions. During 10BASE-T operation, the LXT971A PHY transmits and receives Xilinks* Manchester-en coded data across the networ k link. When the MAC is not \nactively transmitting data, the LXT971 A PHY drives link pulses onto the line.\nIn 10BASE-T mode, the poly nomial scrambler/ de-scrambler is inactive. \nManchester-encoded signals received from th e network are decoded by the LXT971A PHY \nand sent across the MII to the MAC.\nNote: The LXT971A PHY does not support fiber connections at 10 Mbps.\n5.8.1 10BASE-T Preamble Handling\nThe LXT971A PHY offers two options for preamble handling, selected by register bit 16.5.\n• In 10BASE-T mode when register  bit 16.5 = 0, the LXT971A PHY strips the entire \npreamble off of received packets. CRS is a sserted coincident wi th the start of the \npreamble. RX_DV is held Low for the dura tion of the preamble. When RX_DV is \nasserted, the very first two nibbles driven by the LXT971A PHY are the SFD “5D” hex followed by the body of the packet.\n• In 10BASE-T mode when regist er bit 16.5 = 1, the LXT971A PHY passes the preamble \nthrough the MII and asserts RX_DV and CRS  simultaneously. (In 10BASE-T loopback, \nthe LXT971A PHY loops back whatever the MAC transmits to it, including the preamble.)\n5.8.2 10BASE-T Carrier Sense\nFor 10BASE-T links, CRS assertion is based on  reception of valid  preamble, and CRS \nde-assertion is based on reception of an end-of -frame (EOF) marker. register bit 16.7 allows \nCRS de-assertion to be synchronized with RX_DV de-assertion.

If one to four dribble bits are received, the nibble is passed across the MII, padded with ones if necessary.

Once link pulses are detected, data \ntransmission is enabled and remains enabled as long as either the link pulses or data \ntransmission continue. If the link pulses stop, the data transmission is disabled.\n• If the Link Integrity Test function is disabl ed (which can be done by setting Configuration \nregister bit 16.14 to ‘1’), the LXT971A PHY transmits to the connection regardless of \ndetected link pulses.\n5.8.5 Link Failure\nLink failure occurs if the Link Integrity Test is enabled and link pulses or packets stop being \nreceived. If this condition occu rs, the LXT971A PHY returns to the auto-negotiation phase if \nauto-negotiation is enabled. If the Link Integrity Test function is disabled by setting \nConfiguration register bit 16.14 to ‘1’, the LXT971A PHY transmits packets, regardless of link status.\n5.8.6 10BASE-T SQE (Heartbeat)\nBy default, the Signal Quality Error (SQE) or he artbeat function is disabled on the LXT971A \nPHY. To enable this function, set register bit 16.9 = 1. When this function is enabled, the \nLXT971A PHY asserts its COL output for 5 to 15 bit times (BT) after each packet. For SQE timing parameters, see Figure 36, 10BASE-T SQE (Hea rtbeat) Timing , on page 72 .\n5.8.7 10BASE-T Jabber\nIf a transmission exceeds the jabber timer, the LXT971A PHY disables the transmit and \nloopback functions. For jabber timing parameters, see Figure 35, 10BASE-T Ja bber and \nUnjabber Timing , on page 72 .\nThe LXT971A PHY automatically exits jabber mode after the unjabber time has expired. This function can be disabled by setting register bit 16.10 = 1.\n5.8.8 10BASE-T Polarity Correction\nThe LXT971A PHY automatically detects and corr ects for the condition in which the receive \nsignal (TPFIP/N) is inverted. Reve rsed polarity is detected if eight inverted link pulses, or \nfour inverted end-of-frame (EOF) markers, are received consecutively. If link pulses or data \nare not received by the maximum receive time- out period (96 to 128 ms), the polarity state \nis reset to a non-inverted state.\n5.9 Monitoring Operations\n5.9.1 Monitoring Auto-Negotiation\nAuto-negotiation can be monitored as follows:\n• register bit 17.7 is set to ‘1’ once the auto-negotiation process is completed.\n• register bits 1.2 and 17.10 are set to ‘1’ once the link is established.\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 51 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.9  Monitoring Operations\n• register bits 17.14 and 17.9 can be used to determine the link operating conditions \n(speed and duplex).\nNote: When the LXT971A PHY detects incorrect polari ty for a 10BASE-T oper ation, register bit \n17.5 is set to ‘1’.\n5.9.2 Monitoring Next Page Exchange\nThe LXT971A PHY offers an Alternate Next Page mode to simplify the next page exchange \nprocess. Normally, register bit 6.1 (Page Received) remains set until read. When Alternate \nNext Page mode is enabled, register bit 6.1 is automatically cl eared whenever a new \nnegotiation process takes place. This action pr events the user from reading an old value in \nbit 6.1 and assuming th at Registers 5 and 8 (Partner Ab ility) contain vali d information. \nAdditionally, the LXT971A PHY uses register bi t 6.5 to indicate when the current received \npage is the base page. This information is us eful for recognizing when next pages must be \nresent due to a new negotiation process starti ng. register bits 6.1 and 6.5 are cleared when \nread.\n5.9.3 LED Functions\nThe LXT971A PHY has these direct LED dr iver pins: LED1/CFG1, LED2/CFG2, and \nLED3/CFG3.\nOn power-up, all the drivers are asserted for approximately 1 second after reset de-asserts. \nEach LED driver can be programmed us ing the LED Configuration Register ( Table 60, LED \nConfiguration Register - Address 20, Hex 14 , on page 87 ) to indicate one of the following \nconditions:\n• Collision Condition\n• Duplex Mode\n• Link Status\n• Operating Speed• Receive Activity\n• Transmit Activity\nThe LED drivers can also be programmed to display various combined status conditions. \nFor example, setting register bits 20.15:12 to  ‘1101’ produces the following combination of \nLink and Activity indications:\n• If Link is down, LED is off. If activity is detected from the MAC, th e LED still blinks even \nif the link is down.\n• If Link is up, LED is on.\n• If Link is up and activity is  detected, the LED blinks at the stretch interval selected by \nregister bits 20.3:2 and continues to blink as long as activity is present.\nThe LXT971A PHY LED driver pins also provide initial configuration settings. The LED pins \nare sensitive to polarity and automatically pu ll up or pull down to configure for either open \ndrain or open collector circuits (10 mA Max current rating) as required by the hardware \nconfiguration.

The pulse stretch time is extended furt her if the event occurs again during this \npulse stretch period.\nWhen an event such as receiving a packet occurs, the event is edge detected and it starts \nthe stretch timer. The LED driver remains assert ed until the stretch timer expires. If another \nevent occurs before the stretch timer expires, then the stretch timer is reset and the stretch time is extended.\nWhen a long event (such as duplex status) occu rs, the event is edge detected and it starts \nthe stretch timer. When the stretch timer expire s, the edge detector is reset so that a long \nevent causes another pulse to be generated from the edge detector, which resets the \nstretch timer and causes the LED driver to remain asserted.\nFigure 21 shows how the stretch operation functions.\n5.10 Boundary Scan (JTAG 1149.1) Functions\nThe LXT971A PHY includes a IEEE 1149.1 boundary  scan test port for board level testing. \nAll digital input, output, and i nput/output pins are accessible.\nNote: For the related BSDL file, cont act your local sales office or access the Cortina website \n(www.cortina-systems.com) .\n5.10.1 Boundary Scan Interface\nThe boundary scan interface consists of five  pins (TMS, TDI, TDO, TRST_L, and TCK). It \nincludes a state machine, data register arra y, and instruction register. The TMS and TDI \npins are pulled up internally. TCK is pulled down internally. TDO does not have an internal \npull-up or pull-down.\n5.10.2 State Machine\nThe TAP controller is a state machine, with 16 states driven by the TCK and TMS pins. \nUpon reset, the TEST_LOGIC_RESET state is en tered. The state machine is also reset \nwhen TMS and TDI are high for five TCK periods.Figure 21 LED Pulse Stretching \nEvent\nLED\nNote: The direct drive LED outputs in this diagram are shown as active Low.stretch stretch stretch\nB3475-01\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 53 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20115.10  Boundary Scan (JTAG 1149.1)\nFunctions\n5.10.3 Instruction Register\nAfter the state machine resets, the IDCODE inst ruction is always invoked.

Both 3.3 V fiber-optic PH Ys and 5 V fiber-optic PHYs can be used with the LXT971A \nPHY. For details on fiber interface designs and recommendations for Cortina PHYs, see the \ndocument on 100BASE-FX fiber optics listed in Section 1.2, Related Documents .\nAs shown in Figure 25 , the following should occur in 3.3 V fiber PHY applications:\n• The transmit pair should be DC-coupled with the 50 \uf057/16\uf057 pull-up combination.\n• The transmit pair should have a 2.74 k \uf057 pull-down resistor to prevent PHY-to-fiber PHY \ncrosstalk amplification in power-down, loopback, and reset states. (See the fiber \ninterface application note.)\n• The receive pair should be DC-coupled with an emitter current path for the fiber PHY.\n• The signal detect pin should be DC-coupled with an emitter current path for the fiber \nPHY.\nFigure 25 shows a typical example of an interface between the LXT971A PHY and a 3.3 V \nfiber PHY.\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nPage 58 Cortina Systems®LXT971A Single-Port 10/100 Mbps PHY TransceiverLXT971A PHY\nDatasheet\n249414, Revision 5.414 October 20116.3  Fiber Interface\nThe following occurs in 5 V fiber PHY applications as shown in Figure 26 :\n• The transmit pair should be AC-coupled and re-biased to 5 V PECL input levels.\n• The transmit pair should contain a balance offset in the bias resistors to prevent \nPHY-to-fiber PHY crosstalk amplification in  power-down, loopback, and reset states. \n(See the fiber interface application note.)\n• The receive pair should be AC-coupled with an emitter current pa th for the fiber PHY \nand re-biased to  3.3 V LVPECL input levels. \n• The signal detect pin on a 5 V fiber PHY interface should use the logic translator \ncircuitry as shown in Figure 26.\nFigure 26 shows a typical example of an interface between the LXT971A PHY and a 5 V \nfiber PHY.Figure 25 Typical Interface - LXT971A PHY to 3.3 V Fiber PHY\nLXT97x PHY\nTPFIN\nTPFIPTPFOPTPFON\nTo Fiber Network3.3 V\nFiber TxcvrTD -\nTD +\nRD -\nRD +SD SD/TP_L+3.3 V +3.3 V\n+3 .3 V0.01\uf020\uf06d F - 0.1\uf020\uf06dF 16\uf020\uf057\n50\uf020\uf057 50\uf020\uf057\n130\uf020\uf057\n82\uf020\uf057\n1+3.3 V\n0.01\uf020\uf06dF\uf020\uf02d\n0.1\uf020\uf06dF\n82\uf020\uf057 82 \uf057130\uf020\uf057 130\uf020\uf0572.74 k\uf057\nB3402-02\n1.
