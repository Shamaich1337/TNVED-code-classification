The \npin can be directly connected to its specific output, or connected to DIFFOUT when the remote sense amplifier is used. In paralleling modules, one of the V\nOUTS pins is \nconnected to the DIFFOUT pin in remote sensing or directly to V\nOUT with no remote sensing. It is very important to \nconnect these pins to either the DIFFOUT or V OUT since \nthis is the feedback path, and cannot be left open. See the  Applications Information section.\nf\nSET (C6): Frequency Set Pin. A 10µA current is sourced \nfrom this pin. A resistor from this pin to ground sets a \nvoltage that in turn programs the operating frequency. Alternatively, this pin can be driven with a DC voltage that can set the operating frequency. See the Applications Information section.\nSGND (C7, D6, G6-G7, F6-F7): Signal Ground Pin. Return \nground path for all analog and low power circuitry.

When one channel is configured to be master of the two channels, then a capacitor from this pin to ground will set a soft-start ramp rate. The remaining channel can be set up as the slave, and have the master’s output applied through a voltage divider to the slave output’s track pin. This voltage divider is equal to the slave output’s feedback divider for coincidental tracking. See the Applications Information section.\nCOMP1, COMP2 (E6, E7): Current control threshold and \nerror amplifier compensation point for each channel. The current comparator threshold increases with this control voltage. Tie the COMP pins together for parallel operation.

It can provide two 18A outputs with few external input and output capacitors and setup components. This module provides precisely regulated output voltages programmable via external resistors from 0.6V\nDC to 1.8V DC over 4.5V to 15V input \nvoltages. The typical application schematic is shown in Figure 23.\nThe L TM4630 has dual integrated constant-frequency cur -\nrent mode regulators and built-in power MOSFET devices \nwith fast switching speed. The typical switching frequency is 500kHz. For switching-noise sensitive applications, it can be externally synchronized from 400kHz to 780kHz. A resistor can be used to program a free run frequency on the FSET pin. See the Applications Information section.\nWith current mode control and internal feedback loop \ncompensation, the L TM4630 module has sufficient stabil -\nity margins and good transient per\nformance with a wide \nrange of \noutput capacitors, even with all ceramic output \ncapacitors.\nCurrent mode control provides cycle-by-cycle fast current \nlimit and foldback current limit in an overcurrent condition. Internal overvoltage and undervoltage comparators pull the open-drain PGOOD outputs low if the output feedback voltage exits a ±10% window around the regulation point. As the output voltage exceeds 10% above regulation, the bottom MOSFET will turn on to clamp the output voltage. The top MOSFET will be turned off. This overvoltage protect is feedback voltage referred.\nPulling the RUN pins below 1.1V forces the regulators \ninto a shutdown state, by turning off both MOSFETs. The TRACK pins are used for programming the output voltage ramp and voltage tracking during start-up or used for soft-starting the regulator . See the Applications Information section.\nThe L TM4630 is internally compensated to be stable over all \noperating conditions. Table 4 provides a guide line for input and output capacitances for several operating conditions. The Linear Technology µModule Power Design Tool will be provided for transient and stability analysis. The V\nFB pin is \nused to program the output voltage with a single external resistor to ground. A differential remote sense amplifier is available for sensing the output voltage accurately on one of the outputs at the load point, or in parallel operation sensing the output voltage at the load point. \nMultiphase operation can be easily employed with the \nMODE_PLLIN, PHASMD, and CLKOUT pins. Up to 12 phases can be cascaded to run simultaneously with re -\nspect to each other by programming the PHASMD pin to different levels. See the Applications Information section.\nHigh efficiency at light loads can be accomplished with \nselectable Burst Mode operation or pulse-skipping opera -\ntion using the MODE_PLLIN pin. These light load features will accommodate batter y operation. Efficiency graphs are \nprovided for light load operation in the T\nypical Performance \nCharacteristics  section. See the Applications Information section for details. \nA general purpose temperature diode is included inside \nthe module to monitor the temperature of the module. See the Applications Information section for details.\nThe switch pins are available for functional operation \nmonitoring and a resistor-capacitor snubber circuit can be careful placed on the switch pin to ground to dampen any high frequency ringing on the transition edges. See the Applications Information section for details. \nLTM463011\n4630fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4630The typical L TM4630 application circuit is shown in Fig -\nure\xa023. External component selection is primarily deter -\nmined by the maximum load current and output voltage. \nRefer to T able 4 for specific external capacitor requirements\n \nfor particular applications.\nVIN to V OUT Step-Down Ratios\nThere are restrictions in the maximum V IN and V OUT step-\ndown ratio that can be achieved for a given input voltage. \nEach output of the L TM4630 is capable of 98% duty cycle, but the V\nIN to V OUT minimum dropout is still shown as a \nfunction of its load current and will limit output current capability related to high duty cycle on the top side switch. Minimum on-time t\nON(MIN)  is another consideration in \noperating at a specified duty cycle while operating at a certain frequency due to the fact that t\nON(MIN)  < D/f SW, \nwhere D is duty cycle and f SW is the switching frequency. \ntON(MIN)  is specified in the electrical parameters as 90ns. \nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe PWM controller has an internal 0.6V reference voltage. \nAs shown in the Block Diagram, a 60.4kΩ internal feedback resistor connects between the V\nOUTS1  to V FB1 and V OUTS2  \nto V FB2. It is very important that these pins be connected \nto their respective outputs for proper feedback regulation. Overvoltage can occur if these V\nOUTS1  and V OUTS2  pins are \nleft floating when used as individual regulators, or at least one of them is used in paralleled regulators. The output voltage will default to 0.6V with no feedback resistor on either V\nFB1 or V FB2. Adding a resistor R FB from V FB pin to \nGND programs the output voltage:\n  VOUT =0.6V •60.4k +RFB\nRFB\nTable 1. V FB Resistor Table vs Various Output Voltages\nVOUT 0.6V 1.0V 1.2V 1.5V 1.8V\nRFB Open 90.9k 60.4k 40.2k 30.2k\nFor parallel operation of multiple channels the same feed -\nback setting resistor can be used for the parallel design. This is done by connecting the V\nOUTS1  to the output as \nshown in Figure 2, thus tying one of the internal 60.4k resistors to the output.  All of the V\nFB pins tie together with \none programming resistor as shown in Figure 2. APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIn parallel operation, the V FB pins have an I FB current of 20nA \nmaximum each channel. To reduce output voltage error due to this current, an additional V\nOUTS pin can be tied to V OUT, \nand an additional R FB resistor can be used to lower the total \nThevenin equivalent resistance seen by this current. For example in Figure 2, the total Thevenin equivalent resistance of the V\nFB pin is (60.4k//R FB), which is 30.2k where R FB is \nequal to 60.4k for a 1.2V output. Four phases connected in parallel equates to a worse case feedback current of  \n4 • I\nFB = 80nA maximum. The voltage error is 80nA • 30.2k \n= 2.4mV . If V OUTS2  is connected, as shown in Figure 2, to \nVOUT, and another 60.4k resistor is connected from V FB2 to \nground, then the voltage error is reduced to 1.2mV . If the voltage error is acceptable then no additional connections are necessary. The onboard 60.4k resistor is 0.5% accurate and the V\nFB resistor can be chosen by the user to be as \naccurate as needed. All COMP pins are tied together for current sharing between the phases. The TRACK/SS pins can be tied together and a single soft-start capacitor can be used to soft-start the regulator . The soft-start equation will need to have the soft-start current parameter increased by the number of paralleled channels.

For the regulator input four 22µF input ceramic capacitors are used for RMS ripple current.  A 47µF to 100µF surface mount aluminum electrolytic bulk capacitor can be used for more input bulk capacitance.  This bulk input capacitor is only needed if the input source impedance is compromised by long inductive leads, traces or not enough source capacitance. If low impedance power planes are used, then this bulk capacitor is not needed.\nFor a buck converter , the switching duty-cycle can be \nestimated as:\n  D=VOUT\nVIN\nWithout considering the inductor current ripple, for each output, the RMS current of the input capacitor can be estimated as:\n  ICIN(RMS) =IOUT(MAX)\nη%• D • 1 −D ( )\nIn the above equation, η% is the estimated efficiency of the power module. The bulk capacitor can be a switcher-rated electrolytic aluminum capacitor , Polymer capacitor . \nOutput Capacitors\nThe L TM4630 is designed for low output voltage ripple \nnoise and good transient response. The bulk output capacitors defined as C\nOUT are chosen with low enough \neffective series resistance (ESR) to meet the output volt -\nage ripple and transient requirements. C OUT can be a low \nESR tantalum capacitor , the low ESR polymer capacitor or ceramic capacitor . The typical output capacitance range for each output is from 200µF to 470µF . Additional output filtering may be required by the system designer , if further reduction of output ripples or dynamic transient spikes is required. Table 4 shows a matrix of different output voltages and output capacitors to minimize the voltage droop and overshoot during a 4.5A/µs transient. The table optimizes total equivalent ESR and total bulk capacitance to optimize the transient performance. Stability criteria are considered in the Table 4 matrix, and the Linear Technology µModule Power Design Tool will be provided for stability analysis. Multiphase operation will reduce effective output ripple as a function of the number of phases. Application Note 77 discusses this noise reduction versus output ripple current cancellation, but the output capacitance should be considered carefully as a function of stability and transient response. The Linear Technology µModule Power Design Tool can calculate the output ripple reduc -\ntion as the number of implemented phases increases by N times. A small value 10Ω to 50Ω resistor can be place in series from V\nOUT to the V OUTS pin to allow for a bode \nplot analyzer to inject a signal into the control loop and validate the regulator stability. The same resistor could be place in series from V\nOUT to DIFFP and a bode plot \nanalyzer could inject a signal into the control loop and validate the regulator stability.\nBurst Mode Operation\nThe L TM4630 is capable of Burst Mode operation on each \nregulator in which the power MOSFETs operate intermit -\ntently based on load demand, thus saving quiescent cur -\nrent. For applications where maximizing the efficiency at very \nlight loads is a high priority, Burst Mode operation \nshould be applied. Burst Mode operation is enabled with the MODE_PLLIN pin floating. During this operation, the peak current of the inductor is set to approximately one third of the maximum peak current value in normal opera -\ntion even though the voltage at the COMP pin indicates a lower value. The voltage at the COMP pin drops when the inductor’\ns average current is greater than the load \nrequirement. As the COMP voltage drops below 0.5V , the BURST comparator trips, causing the internal sleep line to go high and turn off both power MOSFETs. \nIn sleep mode, the internal circuitry is partially turned off, \nreducing the quiescent current to about 450µA for each output. The load current is now being supplied from the output capacitors. When the output voltage drops, caus -\ning COMP to rise above 0.5V , the internal sleep line goes low, and the L\nTM4630 resumes normal operation. The \nnext oscillator cycle will turn on the top power MOSFET and the switching cycle repeats. Either regulator can be configured for Burst Mode operation.\nLTM463013\n4630fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4630APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPulse-Skipping Mode Operation\nIn applications where low output ripple and high effi -\nciency at intermediate currents are desired, pulse-skipping \nmode should be used. Pulse-skipping operation allows the L TM4630 to skip cycles at low output loads, thus \nincreasing efficiency by reducing switching loss. T\nying \nthe MODE_PLLIN pin to INTV CC enables pulse-skipping \noperation. At light loads the internal current comparator may remain tripped for several cycles and force the top MOSFET to stay off for several cycles, thus skipping cycles. The inductor current does not reverse in this mode. This mode will maintain higher effective frequencies thus lower output ripple and lower noise than Burst Mode operation. Either regulator can be configured for pulse-skipping mode.\nForced Continuous Operation\nIn applications where fixed frequency operation is more \ncritical than low current efficiency, and where the lowest output ripple is desired, forced continuous operation should be used. Forced continuous operation can be enabled by tying the MODE_PLLIN pin to GND. In this mode, inductor current is allowed to reverse during low output loads, the COMP voltage is in control of the current comparator threshold throughout, and the top MOSFET always turns on with each oscillator pulse. During start-up, forced continuous mode is disabled and inductor current is prevented from reversing until the L TM4630’s output voltage is in regulation. Either regulator can be configured for force continuous mode.\nMultiphase Operation\nFor output loads that demand more than 18A of current, \ntwo outputs in L TM4630 or even multiple L TM4630s can be paralleled to run out of phase to provide more output current without increasing input and output voltage ripples. The MODE_PLLIN pin allows the L TM4630 to synchronize to an external clock (between 400kHz and 780kHz) and the internal phase-locked-loop allows the L TM4630 to lock onto incoming clock phase as well. The CLKOUT signal can be connected to the MODE_PLLIN pin of the following stage to line up both the frequency and the phase of the entire system. Tying the PHASMD pin to INTV\nCC, SGND, or  (floating) generates a phase difference (between  \nMODE_PLLIN and CLKOUT) of 120 degrees, 60 degrees, or 90 degrees respectively . A total of 12 phases can be \ncascaded to run simultaneously with respect to each other by programming the PHASMD pin of each L\nTM4630 chan -\nnel to different levels. Figure 3 shows a 2-phase design, 4-phase design and a 6-phase design example for clock phasing with the PHASMD table.\nA multiphase power supply significantly reduces the  \namount of ripple current in both the input and output ca -\npacitors. The RMS input ripple current is reduced by\n, and \nthe effective ripple frequency is multiplied by , the number \nof phases used (assuming that the input voltage is greater \nthan the number of phases used times the output voltage). The output ripple amplitude is also reduced by the number of phases used when all of the outputs are tied together to achieve a single high output current design.\nThe L\nTM4630 device is an inherently current mode con -\ntrolled device, so parallel modules will have very good \ncurrent sharing. This will balance the thermals \non the \ndesign. Figure 26 shows an example of parallel operation and pin connection.\nInput RMS Ripple Current Cancellation\nApplication Note 77 provides a detailed explanation of \nmultiphase operation. The input RMS ripple current cancel -\nlation mathematical derivations are presented, and a graph is displayed representing the RMS ripple current reduction  \nas \na function of the number of interleaved phases. Figure 4  \nshows this graph. \nFrequency Selection and Phase-Lock Loop  \n(MODE_PLLIN and f SET Pins)\nThe L TM4630 device is operated over a range of frequencies to improve power conversion efficiency. It is recommended to operate the module at 500kHz over the output range for the best efficiency and inductor current ripple\nThe L TM4630 switching frequency can be set with an \nexternal resistor from the f\nSET pin to SGND. An accurate \n10µA current source into the resistor will set a voltage that programs the frequency or a DC voltage can be  \nLTM463014\n4630fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4630Figure 4.

Figure 5 shows a graph of frequency setting \nverses programming voltage. An external clock can be applied to the MODE_PLLIN pin from 0V to INTV\nCC over \na frequency range of 400kHz to 780kHz. The clock input high threshold is 1.6V and the clock input low threshold is 1V . The L TM4630 has the PLL loop filter components on board. The frequency setting resistor should always be present to set the initial switching frequency before locking to an external clock.  Both regulators will operate in continuous mode while being externally clock. \nThe output of the PLL phase detector has a pair of comple -\nmentary current sources that charge and discharge the \ninternal filter network. When the external clock is applied then the f\nSET frequency resistor is disconnected with \nan internal switch, and the current sources control the frequency adjustment to lock to the incoming external clock. When no external clock is applied, then the internal switch is on, thus connecting the external f\nSET frequency \nset resistor for free run operation.Low duty cycle applications may approach this minimum on-time limit and care should be taken to ensure that:\n  VOUT\nVIN•FREQ>tON(MIN)\nIf the duty cycle falls below what can be accommodated by the minimum on-time, the controller will begin to skip cycles. The output voltage will continue to be regulated, but the output ripple and current will increase. The on-time can be increased by lowering the switching frequency. A good rule of thumb is to keep on-time longer than 110ns.\nOutput Voltage T racking \nOutput voltage tracking can be programmed externally \nusing the TRACK pins. The output can be tracked up and down with another regulator . The master regulator’s output is divided down with an external resistor divider that is the same as the slave regulator’s feedback divider to imple -\nment coincident tracking. The L TM4630 uses an accurate 60.4k resistor internally for the top feedback resistor for each channel. \nFigure 6 shows an example of coincident \ntracking. Equations:\n  SLAVE =1+60.4k\nRTA\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7• VTRACK\nVTRACK  is the track ramp applied to the slave’s track pin. \nVTRACK  has a control range of 0V to 0.6V , or the internal \nreference voltage. When the master’s output is divided \ndown with the same resistor values used to set the slave’s output, then the slave will coincident track with the master until it reaches its final value. The master will continue to its final value from the slave’s regulation point. Voltage tracking is disabled when V\nTRACK  is more than 0.6V . R TA \nin Figure 6 will be equal to the R FB for coincident tracking. \nFigure 7 shows the coincident tracking waveforms.\nThe TRACK pin of the master can be controlled by a capacitor placed on the master regulator TRACK pin to ground.

Between TRACK = 0.5V and 0.54V , it will operate in forced continuous mode and revert to the selected mode once TRACK > 0.54V . In order to track with another channel once in steady state operation, the L TM4630 is forced into continuous mode operation as soon as V\nFB is below 0.54V regardless of the setting on \nthe MODE_PLLIN pin.  \nRatiometric tracking can be achieved by a few simple \ncalculations and the slew rate value applied to the master’s TRACK pin. As mentioned above, the TRACK pin has a control range from 0 to 0.6V . The master’s TRACK pin slew rate is directly equal to the master’s output slew rate in Volts/Time. The equation: \n  MR\nSR• 60.4k =RTB\nwhere MR is the master’s output slew rate and SR is the slave’s output slew rate in Volts/Time. When coincident \nLTM463017\n4630fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4630APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\ntracking is desired, then MR and SR are equal, thus R TB \nis equal the 60.4k. R TA is derived from equation:\n  RTA =0.6V\nVFB\n60.4k+VFB\nRFB−VTRACK\nRTB\nwhere V FB is the feedback voltage reference of the regula -\ntor , and V TRACK  is 0.6V . Since R TB is equal to the 60.4k \ntop feedback resistor of the slave regulator in equal slew \nrate or coincident tracking, then R TA is equal to R FB with \nVFB = V TRACK . Therefore R TB = 60.4k, and R TA = 60.4k in \nFigure 6.\nIn ratiometric tracking, a different slew rate maybe desired \nfor the slave regulator . R TB can be solved for when SR is \nslower than MR. Make sure that the slave supply slew rate is chosen to be fast enough so that the slave output voltage will reach it final value before the master output.\nFor example, MR = 1.5V/1ms, and SR = 1.2V/1ms. Then \nR\nTB = 76.8k. Solve for R TA to equal to 49.9k.\nEach of the TRACK pins will have the 1.3µA current source on when a resistive divider is used to implement tracking on that specific channel. This will impose an offset on the TRACK pin input. Smaller values resistors with the same ratios as the resistor values calculated from the above equation can be used. For example, where the 60.4k is used then a 6.04k can be used to reduce the TRACK pin offset to a negligible value.\nPower Good\nThe PGOOD pins are open drain pins that can be used to \nmonitor valid output voltage regulation. This pin monitors a 10% window around the regulation point. A resistor can be pulled up to a particular supply voltage no greater than 6V maximum for monitoring.\nStability Compensation\nThe module has already been internally compensated \nfor all output voltages. Table 4 is provided for most ap -\nplication requirements. The Linear Technology µModule Power Design Tool will be provided for other control loop \noptimization. Run Enable\nThe RUN pins have an enable threshold of 1.4V maximum, \ntypically 1.25V with 150mV of hysteresis. They control the turn on each of the channels and INT\nVCC. These pins can be \npulled up to V IN for 5V operation, or a 5V Zener diode can be \nplaced on the pins and a 10k to 100k resistor can be placed up to higher than 5V  input for enabling the channels. The RUN pins can also be used for output voltage sequencing.  \nIn parallel operation the RUN pins can be tie together and controlled from a single control. See the T ypical Applica -\ntion cir\ncuits in Figure 23.\nINTVCC and EXTV CC\nThe L TM4630 module has an internal 5V low dropout \nregulator that is derived from the input voltage. This regu -\nlator is used to power the control circuitry and the power MOSFET drivers. This regulator can sour ce up to 70mA, \nand typically uses ~30mA for powering the device at the maximum frequency\n. This internal 5V supply is enabled \nby either RUN1 or RUN2.\nEXTV CC allows an external 5V supply to power the L TM4630 \nand reduce power dissipation from the internal low dropout \n5V regulator . The power loss savings can be calculated by:\n (VIN – 5V) • 30mA = PLOSS\nEXTV CC has a threshold of 4.7V for activation, and a \nmaximum rating of 6V . When using a 5V input, connect this 5V input to EXTV\nCC also to maintain a 5V gate drive \nlevel. EXTV CC must sequence on after V IN, and EXTV CC \nmust sequence off before V IN.\nDifferential Remote Sense Amplifier\nAn accurate differential remote sense amplifier is provided \nto sense low output voltages accurately at the remote load points. This is especially true for high current loads. The amplifier can be used on one of the two channels, or on a single parallel output. It is very important that the DIFFP and DIFFN are connected properly at the output, and DIFFOUT is connected to either V\nOUTS1  or V OUTS2 . \nIn parallel operation, the DIFFP and DIFFN are connected properly at the output, and DIFFOUT is connected to one of the V\nOUTS pins. Review the parallel schematics in  \nFigure 24 and review Figure 2.\nLTM463018\n4630fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4630APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSW Pins\nThe SW pins are generally for testing purposes by moni -\ntoring these pins. These pins can also be used to dampen \nout switch node ringing caused by LC parasitic in the switched current paths. Usually a series R-C combina -\ntion is used called a snubber circuit. The resistor will dampen the resonance and the capacitor is chosen to only affect the high frequency ringing across the resistor . \nIf \nthe stray inductance or capacitance can be measured or \napproximated then a somewhat analytical technique can be used to select the snubber values. The inductance is usually easier to predict. It combines the power path board inductance in combination with the MOSFET interconnect \nbond wire inductance. \nFirst the SW pin can be monitored with a wide bandwidth \nscope with a high frequency scope probe. The ring fre -\nquency can be measured for its value. The impedance Z can be calculated:\n ZL = 2πfL,\nwhere f is the resonant frequency of the ring, and L is the total parasitic inductance in the switch path. If a resistor is selected that is equal to Z, then the ringing should be dampened. The \nsnubber capacitor value is chosen so that \nits impedance is equal to the resistor at the ring frequency. Calculated by: ZC = 1/(2πfC). These values are a good place to start with. Modification to these components should be made to attenuate the ringing with the least amount of power loss. \nTemperature Monitoring\nA diode connected PNP transistor is used for the TEMP \nmonitor function by monitoring its voltage over tempera -\nture. The temperature dependence of this diode voltage can be understood in the equation: \n  VD=nVTlnID\nIS\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7where V T is the thermal voltage (kT/q), and n, the ideality \nfactor , is 1 for the diode connected PNP transistor be-\ning used in the L TM4630. I S is expressed by the typical \nempirical equation:  \n  IS=I0exp–VG0\nVT\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nwhere I 0 is a process and geometry dependent current, (I 0 \nis typically around 20k orders of magnitude larger than I S \nat room temperature) and V G0 is the band gap voltage of \n1.2V extrapolated to absolute zero or –273°C. \nIf we take the I S equation and substitute into the V D equa-\ntion, then we get:\n  VD=VG0–kT\nq\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7lnI0\nID\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7, VT=kT\nq\nThe expression shows that the diode voltage decreases \n(linearly if I 0 were constant) with increasing temperature \nand constant diode current. Figure 6 shows a plot of V D \nvs Temperature over the operating temperature range of the L TM4630.\nIf we take this equation and differentiate it with respect to \ntemperature T , then:\n  dVD\ndT=–VG0– VD\nT\nThis dV D/dT term is the temperature coefficient equal to \nabout –2mV/K or –2mV/°C. The equation is simplified for the first order derivation.\nSolving for T , T = –(V\nG0 – V D)/(dV D/dT) provides the \ntemperature.1st Example: Figure 8 for 27°C, or 300K the diode \nvoltage is 0.598V , thus, 300K = –(1200mV – 598mV)/  \n–2.0 mV/K)\n2nd Example: \nFigure 8 for 75°C, or 350K the diode \nvoltage is 0.50V , thus, 350K = –(1200mV – 500mV)/  \n–2.0mV/K)\nLTM463019\n4630fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4630APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nConverting the Kelvin scale to Celsius is simply taking the \nKelvin temp and subtracting 273 from it.\nA typical forward voltage is given in the electrical charac -\nteristics section of the data sheet, and Figure 6 is the plot \nof this forward voltage. Measure this for\nward voltage at \n27°C to establish a reference point. Then using the above expression while measuring the forward voltage over temperature will provide a general temperature monitor . Connect a resistor between TEMP and V\nIN to set the cur -\nrent to 100µA. See Figure 24 for an example.the µModule \nregulator’s thermal performance in their ap-\nplication at various electrical and environmental operating \nconditions to compliment any FEA activities. Without FEA software, the thermal resistances reported in the Pin Con -\nfiguration section are in-and-of themselves not relevant to providing guidance of thermal per formance; instead, the \nderating \ncurves provided in the data sheet can be used in \na manner that yields insight and guidance pertaining to one’s application-usage, and can be adapted to correlate thermal performance to one’s own application.\nThe Pin Configuration section typically gives four thermal \ncoefficients explicitly defined in JESD 51-12; these coef -\nficients are quoted or paraphrased below:\n1.\n θJA, the thermal resistance from junction to ambient, is \nthe natural convection junction-to-ambient air thermal \nresistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed enclo -\nsure. This environment is sometimes referred to as “still air” although natural convection causes the air to move.  \nThis value is determined with the part mounted to a JESD \n51-9 defined test board, which does not reflect \nan actual application or viable operating condition.\n2. θJCbottom , the thermal resistance from junction to the \nbottom of the product case, is the junction-to-board thermal resistance with all of the component power dissipation flowing through the bottom of the package. In the typical µModule, the bulk of the heat flows out the bottom of the package, but there is always heat flow out into the ambient environment. As a result, this thermal resistance value may be useful for comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n3.\n θJCTOP , the thermal resistance from junction to top of \nthe product case, is determined with nearly all of the component power dissipation flowing through the top of the package. As the electrical connections of the typical µModule are on the bottom of the package, it is rare for an application to operate such that most of the heat flows from the junction to the top of the part.  As in the case of θ\nJCBOTTOM , this value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.Figure 8.

The motivation for providing these thermal coefficients is found in JESD 51-12 (“Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information”).\nMany designers may opt to use laboratory equipment \nand a test vehicle such as the demo board to anticipate \nLTM463020\n4630fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4630APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n4. θJB, the thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board, is the junction-to-board thermal resistance \nwhere almost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the µModule and into the board, and is really the sum of the θ\nJCbottom  and the thermal resistance of the bottom \nof the part through the solder joints and through a por -\ntion of the board. The board temperature is measured a specified distance from the package, using a two sided, two layer board. This board is described in JESD 51-9.\nA graphical representation of the aforementioned ther -\nmal resistances is given in Figure 9; blue resistances are \ncontained within the µModule regulator , whereas green \nresistances are external to the µModule.\nAs \na practical matter , it should be clear to the reader that \nno individual or sub-group of the four thermal resistance \nparameters defined by JESD 51-12 or provided in the Pin Configuration section replicates or conveys normal operating conditions of a µModule. For example, in normal board-mounted applications, never does 100% of the device’s total power loss (heat) thermally conduct exclu -\nsively through the top or exclusively through bottom of the \nµM\nodule—as the standard defines for θ JCtop and θJCbottom , \nrespectively. In practice, power loss is thermally dissipated \nin both directions away from the package—granted, in the absence of a heat sink and airflow, a majority of the heat flow is into the board.\nWithin a SIP (system-in-package) module, be aware there \nare multiple power devices and components dissipating power , with a consequence that the thermal resistances relative to different junctions of components or die are not exactly linear with respect to total package power loss. To reconcile this complication without sacrificing modeling simplicity—but also, not ignoring practical realities—an approach has been taken using FEA software modeling along with laboratory testing in a controlled-environment chamber to reasonably define and correlate the thermal resistance values supplied in this data sheet: (1) Initially, FEA software is used to accurately build the mechanical geometry of the µModule and the specified PCB with all of the correct material coefficients along with accurate power loss source definitions; (2) this model simulates a software-defined JEDEC environment consistent with JSED51-9 to predict power loss heat flow and temperature readings at different interfaces that enable the calculation of the JEDEC-defined thermal resistance values; (3) the model and FEA software is used to evaluate the µModule with heat sink and airflow; (4) having solved for and analyzed these thermal resistance values and simulated various operating conditions in the software model, a thorough laboratory evaluation replicates the simulated conditions with thermocouples within a controlled-environment chamber while operating the device at the same power loss as that which was simulated. An outcome of this process and due-diligence yields a set of derating curves provided in other sections of this data sheet. After these laboratory test have been performed and correlated to the µModule \nmodel, then the θ\nJB and θ BA are summed together to cor -\nrelate quite well with the µModule model with no airflow or heat sinking in a properly define chamber .

Each system has its own thermal characteristics, therefore thermal analysis must be performed by the user \nin a particular system.\nThe L TM4630 module has been designed to effectively \nremove heat from both the top and bottom of the pack -\nage. The bottom substrate material has very low thermal resistance to the printed circuit board. An external heat \nsink can be applied to the top of the device for excellent heat sinking with airflow\n. \nFigures 10 and 11 show temperature plots of the L TM4630 with no heat sink and 200LFM airflow.\nThese plots equate to a paralleled 12V to 1.0V at 36A \ndesign operating at 84.5% efficiency, and 12V to 1.2V at 36A design operating at 86% efficiency.\nSafety Considerations\nThe L TM4630 modules do not provide isolation from V\nIN \nto VOUT. There is no internal fuse. If required, a slow blow \nfuse with a rating twice the maximum input current needs \nto be provided to protect each unit from catastrophic failure. The device does support over current protection. A temperature diode is provided for monitoring internal temperature, and can be used to detect the need for thermal shutdown that can be done by controlling the RUN pin.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPower Derating\nThe 1.0V and 1.5V power loss curves in Figures 13 and 14 \ncan be used in coordination with the load current derating curves in Figures 15 to 22 for calculating an approximate Θ\nJA thermal resistance for the L TM4630 with various heat \nsinking and airflow conditions. The power loss curves are taken at room temperature, and are increased with a 1.35 to 1.4 multiplicative factor at 125°C. These factors come from the fact that the power loss of the regulator increases about 45% from 25°C to 150°C, thus a 50% spread over 125°C delta equates to ~0.35%/°C loss increase. A 125°C maximum junction minus 25°C room temperature equates to a 100°C increase. This 100°C increase multiplied by 0.35%/°C equals a 35% power loss increase at the 125°C junction, thus the 1.35 multiplier . \nThe derating curves are plotted with CH1 and CH2 in \nparallel single output operation starting at 36A of load with low ambient temperature. The output voltages are 1.0V and 1.5V . These are chosen to include the lower and higher output voltage ranges for correlating the thermal resistance. Thermal models are derived from several temperature measurements in a controlled temperature chamber along with thermal modeling analysis. \nFigure 10. Thermal Image 12V to 1.0V , \n36A with 200LFM without Heat SinkFigure 11. Thermal Image 12V to 1.2V , 36A with 200LFM without Heat Sink\n\nLTM463022\n4630fa\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4630The junction temperatures are monitored while ambient \ntemperature is increased with and without airflow. The power loss increase with ambient temperature change is factored into the derating curves. The junctions are maintained at ~120°C maximum while lowering output current or power while increasing ambient temperature. The decreased output current will decrease the internal module loss as ambient temperature is increased. \nThe monitored junction temperature of 120°C minus \nthe ambient operating temperature specifies how much module temperature rise can be allowed. As an example in  \nFigure 15, the load current is derated to ~25A at ~86°C with no air or heat sink and the power loss for the 12V to 1.0V at 25A output is a ~5.5W loss. The 5.5W loss is calculated with the ~4.1W room temperature loss from the 12V to 1.0V power loss cur ve at 25A, and the 1.35 multiplying \nfactor at 125°C ambient. If the 86°C ambient temperature is subtracted from the 120°C junction temperature, then the difference of 34°C divided 5.5W equals a 6.2°C/W \nΘJA \nthermal resistance. Table 2 specifies a 7°C/W value which is pretty close. The airflow graphs are more accurate due to the fact that the ambient temperature environment is controlled better with airflow. As an example in Figure 19, the load current is derated to ~30A at ~72°C with 200LFM of airflow and the power loss for the 12V to 1.5V at 30A output is a ~7.9W loss. The 7.9W loss is calculated with the ~5.9W room temperature loss from the 12V to 1.5V power loss curve at 22A, and the 1.35 multiplying factor at 125°C ambient. If the 72°C ambient temperature is subtracted from the 120°C junction temperature, then the difference of 48°C divided 7.9W equals a 6.0°C/W θ\nJA thermal resistance. Table 2 specifies a 6.0°C/W value \nwhich is pretty close. Tables 2 and 3 provide equivalent thermal resistances for 1.0V and 1.5V outputs with and without airflow and heat sinking. \nThe derived thermal resistances in Tables 2 and 3 for the \nvarious conditions can be multiplied by the calculated power loss as a function of ambient temperature to derive temperature rise above ambient, thus maximum junction temperature. Room temperature power loss can be derived from the efficiency curves and adjusted with the above ambient temperature multiplicative factors. The printed circuit board is a 1.6mm thick four layer board with two ounce copper for the two outer layers and one ounce copper for the two inner layers. The PCB dimensions are 101mm × 114mm. The BGA heat sinks are listed in Table 3.\nLayout Checklist/Example\nThe high integration of L TM4630 makes the PCB board \nlayout very simple and easy. However , to optimize its electri -\ncal and thermal performance, some layout considerations are still necessar y\n.\n• Use large PCB copper areas for high current paths, including V\nIN, GND, V OUT1 and V OUT2. It helps to mini -\nmize the PCB conduction loss and thermal stress.\n• Place high frequency ceramic input and output capaci -\ntors next to the V IN, PGND and V OUT pins to minimize \nhigh frequency noise.\n• Place a dedicated power ground layer underneath the unit.\n•\n To minimize the via conduction loss and reduce module thermal \nstress, use multiple vias for interconnection \nbetween top layer and other power layers.\n• Do not put via directly on the pad, unless they are capped or plated over .\n•\n Use a separated SGND ground copper area for com -\nponents connected to signal pins. Connect the SGND to GND underneath the unit. \n•\n For parallel modules, tie the V OUT, VFB, and COMP pins \ntogether . Use an internal layer to closely connect these pins together . The TRACK pin can be tied a common capacitor for regulator soft-start.\n•\n Bring out test points on the signal pins for monitoring.\nFigure 12 gives a good example of the recommended layout.
