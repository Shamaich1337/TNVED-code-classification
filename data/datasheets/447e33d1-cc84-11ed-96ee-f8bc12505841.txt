Unlike many JFET amplifiers, the AD8610/AD8620 \ninput bias current is low over the entire operating temperature \nrange. The AD8610/AD8620 are stable with capacitive loads of over 1000 pF in noninverting unity gain; much larger capacitive loads can be driven easily at higher noise gains. The AD8610/ AD8620 swing to within 1.2 V of the supplies even with a 1 kΩ \nload, maximizing dynamic range even with limited supply volt-\nages. Outputs slew at 50 V/μs in either inverting or noninverting gain configurations, and settle to 0.01% accuracy in less than 600 ns. Combined with high input impedance, great precision, and very high output drive, the AD8610/AD8620 are ideal amplifiers for driving high performance ADC inputs and buffering DAC converter outputs. Applications for the AD8610/AD8620 include electronic instru-\nments; ATE amplification, buffering, and integrator circuits; \nCAT/MRI/ultrasound medical instrumentation; instrumentation quality photodiode amplification; fast precision filters (including \nPLL filters); and high quality audio. \nThe AD8610/AD8620 are fully specified over the extended \nindustrial temperature range (−40°C to +125°C). The AD8610 is available in the narrow 8-lead SOIC and the tiny 8-lead MSOP \nsurface-mount packages. The AD8620 is available in the narrow \n8-lead SOIC package. The 8-lead MSOP packaged devices are \navail-able only in tape and reel.  \n \n \nAD8610/AD8620  \n \nRev.

Channel Separation Test Circuit \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8610/AD8620 are manufactured on the Analog Devices, \nInc., XFCB (eXtra fast complementary bipolar) process. XFCB \nis fully dielectrically isolated (DI) and used in conjunction with \nN-channel JFET technology and thin film resistors (that can be \ntrimmed) to create the JFET input amplifier. Dielectrically isolated NPN and PNP transistors fabricated on XFCB have an f\nτ > 3 GHz. \nLow TC thin film resistors enable very accurate offset voltage and offset voltage temperature coefficient trimming. These process breakthroughs allow Analog Devices IC designers to create an \namplifier with faster slew rate and more than 50% higher band-\nwidth at half of the current consumed by its closest competition. The AD8610/AD8620 are unconditionally stable in all gains, even with capacitive loads well in excess of 1 nF. The AD8610B grade achieves less than 100 μV of offset and 1 μV/°C of offset \ndrift, numbers usually associated with very high precision bipolar \ninput amplifiers. The AD8610 is offered in the tiny 8-lead MSOP as well as narrow 8-lead SOIC surface-mount packages and is fully specified with supply voltages from ±5.0 V to ±13 V . The very wide specified temperature range, up to 125°C, guarantees superior operation in systems with little or no active cooling. \nThe unique input architecture of the AD8610/AD8620 features \nextremely low input bias currents and very low input offset voltage. \nLow power consumption minimizes the die temperature and maintains the very low input bias current. Unlike many competi-tive JFET amplifiers, the AD8610/AD8620 input bias currents are low even at elevated temperatures. Typical bias currents are less \nthan 200 pA at 85°C. The gate current of a JFET doubles every \n10°C, resulting in a similar increase in input bias current over temperature. Give special care to the PC board layout to minimize leakage currents between PCB traces. Improper layout and board handling generates a leakage current that exceeds the bias current of the AD8610/AD8620. 138\n136\n120128\n126\n124\n122132\n130134\n02730-042CS (dB)\nFREQUENCY (kHz)0 100 150 200 50 250 300 350\n \nFigure 42.

Figure 44 and Figure 45 compare the AD8610/ \nAD8620 against the OPA627 in the noninverting gain configu-ration driving a 10 kΩ resistor and 10,000 pF capacitor placed in parallel on its output, with a square wave input set to a frequency of 200 kHz.

F | Page 15 of 24 Slew Rate (Unity Gain Inverting vs. Noninverting) \nAmplifiers generally have a faster slew rate in an inverting unity \ngain configuration due to the absence of the differential input \ncapacitance. Figure 49 through Figure 52 show the performance \nof the AD8610/AD8620 configured in a unity gain of –1 compared to the OPA627.

This is the toughest \ncondition to impose on any amplifier because the input common-\nmode capacitance of the amplifier generally makes its SR appear worse. The slew rate of an amplifier varies according to the voltage difference between its two inputs. To observe the maximum SR, a voltage difference of about 2 V between the inputs must be \nensured. This is required for virtually any JFET op amp so that \none side of the op amp input circuit is completely off, thus maxi-mizing the current available to charge and discharge the internal compensation capacitance. Lower differential drive voltages produce lower slew rate readings. A JFET input op amp with a \nslew rate of 60 V/μs at unity gain with V\nIN = 10 V may slew at  \n20 V/μs if it is operated at a gain of +100 with V IN = 100 mV . \nAD8610/AD8620  \n \nRev. F | Page 16 of 24 The slew rate of the AD8610/AD8620 is double that of the \nOPA627 when configured in a unity gain of +1 (see Figure 53 \nand Figure 54). \n02730-053VOLTAGE (5V/DIV)\nTIME (400ns/DIV)VS = ±13V\nRL= 2kΩ\nG=  + 1\nSR = 85V/µs\n \nFigure 53. +Slew Rate of AD8610/AD8620 in Unity Gain of +1 \n02730-054VOLTAGE (5V/DIV)\nTIME (400ns/DIV)VS = ±13V\nRL= 2kΩ\nG=  + 1\nSR = 23V/µs\n \nFigure 54. +Slew Rate of OPA627 in Unity Gain of +1 \nThe slew rate of an amplifier determines the maximum frequency \nat which it can respond to a large signal input.

AD8610 FPBW Input Overvoltage Protection \nWhen the input of an amplifier is driven below V EE or above V CC  \nby more than one V BE, large currents flow from the substrate \nthrough the negative supply (V–) or the positive supply (V+), \nrespectively, to the input pins and can destroy the device. If the input source can deliver larger currents than the maximum forward current of the diode (>5 mA), a series resistor can be added to protect the inputs. With its very low input bias and \noffset current, a large series resistor can be placed in front of the \nAD8610/AD8620 inputs to limit current to below damaging levels. Series resistance of 10 kΩ generates less than 25 μV of offset. This 10 kΩ allows input voltages more than 5 V beyond either power supply. Thermal noise generated by the resistor adds \n7.5 nV/√Hz to the noise of the AD8610/AD8620. For the AD8610/ \nAD8620, differential voltages equal to the supply voltage do not cause any problems (see Figure 55). In this context, note that the high breakdown voltage of the input FETs eliminates the need to include clamp diodes between the inputs of the amplifier, a practice \nthat is mandatory on many precision op amps. Unfortunately, \nclamp diodes greatly interfere with many application circuits, such as precision rectifiers and comparators. The AD8610/ \nAD8620 are free from these limitations. \nV1\n–13V3\n27\n4+13V\n14V\n06\nAD8610\n02730-056 \nFigure 56. Unity Gain Follower \nNo Phase Reversal \nMany amplifiers misbehave when one or both of the inputs are \nforced beyond the input common-mode voltage range. Phase reversal is typified by the transfer function of the amplifier, \neffectively reversing its transfer polarity. In some cases, this can cause lockup and even equipment damage in servo systems and can cause permanent damage or no recoverable parameter shifts to the amplifier itself. Many amplifiers feature compensation circuitry to combat these effects, but some are only effective for \nthe inverting input. The AD8610/AD8620 are designed to prevent \nphase reversal when one or both inputs are forced beyond their \ninput common-mode voltage range. \n02730-057VOLTAGE (5V/DIV)\nTIME (400µs/DIV)VOUTVIN\n \nFigure 57.

Offset Voltage Nulling Circuit \nProgrammable Gain Amplifier (PGA) \nThe combination of low noise, low input bias current, low input \noffset voltage, and low temperature drift make the AD8610/ \nAD8620 a perfect solution for programmable gain amplifiers. \nPGAs are often used immediately after sensors to increase the \ndynamic range of the measurement circuit. Historically, the large on resistance of switches (combined with the large I\nB currents  \nof amplifiers) created a large dc offset in PGAs. Recent and improved monolithic switches and amplifiers completely remove these problems. A PGA discrete circuit is shown in Figure 67.  \nIn Figure 67, when the 10 pA bias current of the AD8610 is \ndropped across the (<5 Ω) R\nON of the switch, it results in a \nnegligible offset error. \nWhen high precision resistors are used, as in the circuit of \nFigure 67, the error introduced by the PGA is within the  \n½ LSB requirement for a 16-bit system.

The \ninstrumentation amplifier configuration features high common-\nmode rejection, balanced differential inputs, and stable, accurately defined gain. Low input bias currents and fast settling are achieved with the JFET input AD8610/AD8620. Most instrumentation amplifiers cannot match the high frequency performance of this \ncircuit. The circuit bandwidth is 25 MHz at a gain of 1, and close to \n5 MHz at a gain of 10. Settling time for the entire circuit is 550 ns to 0.01% for a 10 V step (gain = 10). Note that the resistors around the input pins need to be small enough in value so that the RC time constant they form in combination with stray circuit capaci-tance does not reduce circuit bandwidth. \n02730-0681/2 AD8620+INB\nR2\n1kΩ\nC2\n10pFR4\n2kΩC4\n15pFVOUT\nR8\n2kΩR7\n2kΩR1\n1kΩC5\n10pF\nV–V+\nAD8610\nU2\nC3\n15pFR5\n2kΩR62kΩ+INA\nV–V+\n1/2 AD8620\nU1\nRG\n5\n67\nU17\n463\n28\n413\n2\n \nFigure 68. High Speed Instrumentation Amplifier \nHigh Speed Filters \nThe four most popular configurations are Butterworth, Elliptical, \nBessel (Thompson), and Chebyshev. Each type has a response \nthat is optimized for a given characteristic, as shown in Table 6. In active filter applications using operational amplifiers, the dc \naccuracy of the amplifier is critical to optimal filter performance. The offset voltage and bias current of the amplifier contribute to output error. Input offset voltage is passed by the filter and can \nbe amplified to produce excessive output offset. For low frequency \napplications requiring large value input resistors, bias and offset currents flowing through these resistors also generate an offset \nvoltage. \nAt higher frequencies, the dynamic response of the amplifier \nmust be carefully considered. In this case, slew rate, bandwidth, and open-loop gain play a major role in amplifier selection.  \nThe slew rate must be both fast and symmetrical to minimize \ndistortion. The bandwidth of the amplifier, in conjunction with the gain of the filter, dictates the frequency response of the filter. The use of high performance amplifiers, such as the AD8610/AD8620, \nminimizes both dc and ac errors in all active filter applications. \nSecond-Order, Low-Pass Filter \nFigure 69 shows the AD8610 configured as a second-order, \nButterworth, low-pass filter. With the values as shown, the \ndesign corner was 1 MHz, and the bench measurement was  974 kHz. The wide bandwidth of the AD8610/AD8620 allows corner frequencies into the megahertz range, but the input \ncapacitances should be taken into account by making C1 and \nC2 smaller than the calculated values.

F | Page 21 of 24 High Speed, Low Noise Differential Driver \nThe AD8620 is a perfect candidate as a low noise differential \ndriver for many popular ADCs. There are also other applica-\ntions (such as balanced lines) that require differential drivers. \nThe circuit of Figure 70 is a unique line driver widely used in industrial applications. With ±13 V supplies, the line driver can deliver a differential signal of 23 V p-p into a 1 kΩ load. The high slew rate and wide bandwidth of the AD8620 combine to \nyield a full power bandwidth of 145 kHz while the low noise \nfront end produces a referred-to-input noise voltage spectral density of 6 nV/√Hz. The design is a balanced transmission system without transformers, where output common-mode rejection of noise is of paramount importance. Like the transformer-based \ndesign, either output can be shorted to ground for unbalanced \nline driver applications without changing the circuit gain of 1. This allows the design to be easily set to noninverting, inverting,  \nor differential operation.  \n3\n2\nV–3\n2\nV–V+\n5\n6V+\n1/2 AD8620\nU2\nAD8610\n1/2 AD8620\nU36\n701\n0\n02730-070R3\n1kΩR4\n1kΩR13\n1kΩR5\n1kΩ\nR6\n10kΩ\nR7\n1kΩR1\n1kΩR12\n1kΩ\nR2\n1kΩR10\n50Ω\nR11\n50ΩR81kΩ\nR9\n1kΩ\nVO2VO1\nVO2 – VO1 = VIN V–V+\n \nFigure 70.
