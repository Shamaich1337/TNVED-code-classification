These devices are part of a \nfamily of current-sense amplifiers (also called current-\nshunt monitors) that sense voltage drops across \ncurrent-sense resistors at common-mode voltages \nfrom –0.2 V to +26 V, independent of the supply \nvoltage. The INAx180 integrate a matched resistor \ngain network in four, fixed-gain device options: 20 \nV/V, 50 V/V, 100 V/V, or 200 V/V. This matched gain \nresistor network minimizes gain error and reduces the \ntemperature drift.\nAll these devices operate from a single 2.7-V to 5.5-\nV power supply. The single-channel INA180 draws \na maximum supply current of 260 µA; whereas, \nthe dual-channel INA2180 draws a maximum supply \ncurrent of 500 µA, and the quad channel draws a \nmaximum supply current of 900 µA.\nThe INA180 is available in a 5-pin, SOT-23 package \nwith two different pin configurations. The INA2180 is \navailable in 8-pin, VSSOP and WSON packages . The \nINA4180 is available in a 14-pin, TSSOP package. \nAll device options are specified over the extended \noperating temperature range of –40°C to +125°C.\nPackaging Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nINA180 SOT-23 (5) 2.90 mm × 1.60 mm\nINA2180VSSOP (8) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\nWSON (8) 2.00 mm × 2.00 mm\nINA4180 TSSOP (14) 5.00 mm × 4.40 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the package option \naddendum at the end of the data sheet.INA180 , INA2180 , INA4180\nSBOS741H  – APRIL 2017 – REVISED JULY 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The \nability to detect rapid changes in the sensed current, as well as the ability to quickly slew the output, make the \nINAx180 a good choice for applications that require a quick response to input current changes. One application \nthat requires high bandwidth and slew rate is low-side motor control, where the ability to follow rapid changing \ncurrent in the motor allows for more accurate control over a wider operating range. Another application that \nrequires higher bandwidth and slew rates is system fault detection, where the INAx180 are used with an external \ncomparator and a reference to quickly detect when the sensed current is out of range.\n8.3.2 Wide Input Common-Mode Voltage Range\nThe INAx180 support input common-mode voltages from –0.2 V to +26 V. Because of the internal topology, \nthe common-mode range is not restricted by the power-supply voltage (V S) as long as V S stays within the \noperational range of 2.7 V to 5.5 V. The ability to operate with common-mode voltages greater or less than V S \nallow the INAx180 to be used in high-side, as well as low-side, current-sensing applications, as shown in Figure \n8-4.\nBus Supply\n±0.2 V to +26 V\nHigh-Side Sensing\nLow-Side SensingLOADCommon-mode voltage (V CM) \nis bus-voltage dependent.\nCommon-mode voltage (V CM) \nis always near ground and is \nisolated from bus-voltage spikes.Direction of Positive \nCurrent Flow\nIN+Direction of Positive \nCurrent Flow\nRSENSERSENSE\nIN±IN+\nIN±\nFigure 8-4. High-Side and Low-Side Sensing Connections\n8.3.3 Precise Low-Side Current Sensing\nWhen used in low-side current sensing applications the offset voltage of the INAx180 is within ±150 µV. The \nlow offset performance of the INAx180 has several benefits. First, the low offset allows the device to be used \nin applications that must measure current over a wide dynamic range. In this case, the low offset improves the \naccuracy when the sensed currents are on the low end of the measurement range. Another advantage of low \noffset is the ability to sense lower voltage drop across the sense resistor accurately, thus allowing a lower-value \nshunt resistor. Lower-value shunt resistors reduce power loss in the current sense circuit, and help improve the \npower efficiency of the end application.\nThe gain error of the INAx180 is specified to be within 1% of the actual value. As the sensed voltage becomes \nmuch larger than the offset voltage, this voltage becomes the dominant source of error in the current sense \nmeasurement.INA180, INA2180, INA4180\nSBOS741H – APRIL 2017 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: INA180  INA2180  INA4180\n8.3.4 Rail-to-Rail Output Swing\nThe INAx180 allow linear current sensing operation with the output close to the supply rail and GND. The \nmaximum specified output swing to the positive rail is 30 mV, and the maximum specified output swing to \nGND is only 5 mV. To compare the output swing of the INAx180 to an equivalent operational amplifier (op \namp), the inputs are overdriven to approximate the open-loop condition specified in op amp data sheets. The \ncurrent-sense amplifier is a closed-loop system; therefore, the output swing to GND can be limited by the \nproduct of the offset voltage and amplifier gain.\nFor devices that have positive offset voltages, the swing to GND is limited by the larger of either the offset \nvoltage multiplied by the gain or the swing to GND specified in the Electrical Characteristics  table.\nFor example, in an application where the INA180A4 (gain = 200 V/V) is used for low-side current sensing and \nthe device has an offset of 40 µV, the product of the device offset and gain results in a value of 8 mV, greater \nthan the specified negative swing value. Therefore, the swing to GND for this example is 8 mV. If the same \ndevice has an offset of –40 µV, then the calculated zero differential signal is –8 mV. In this case, the offset helps \noverdrive the swing in the negative direction, and swing performance is consistent with the value specified in the \nElectrical Characteristics  table.\nThe offset voltage is a function of the common-mode voltage as determined by the CMRR specification; \ntherefore, the offset voltage increases when higher common-mode voltages are present. The increase in offset \nvoltage limits how low the output voltage can go during a zero-current condition when operating at higher \ncommon-mode voltages. Figure 8-5  shows the typical limitation of the zero-current output voltage vs common-\nmode voltage for each gain option.\nCommon Mode Voltage (V)Zero Current Output Voltage (V)\n0 246 81012141618 2022 24 2600.0060.0120.0180.0240.030.0360.0420.0480.0540.06\nD033A1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nFigure 8-5. Zero-Current Output Voltage vs Common-Mode Voltage\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Normal Mode\nThe INAx180 is in normal operation when the following conditions are met:\n•The power supply voltage (V S) is between 2.7 V and 5.5 V.\n•The common-mode voltage (V CM) is within the specified range of –0.2 V to +26 V.\n•The maximum differential input signal times gain is less than V S minus the output voltage swing to V S.\n•The minimum differential input signal times gain is greater than the swing to GND (see the Rail-to-Rail Output \nSwing  section).\nDuring normal operation, the device produces an output voltage that is the gained-up  representation of the \ndifference voltage from IN+ to IN–.\n8.4.2 Input Differential Overload\nIf the differential input voltage (V IN+ – V IN–) times gain exceeds the voltage swing specification, the INAx180 \ndrive the output as close as possible to the positive supply, and does not provide accurate measurement of the \ndifferential input voltage. If this input overload occurs during normal circuit operation, then reduce the value of www.ti.comINA180, INA2180, INA4180\nSBOS741H – APRIL 2017 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: INA180  INA2180  INA4180\nthe shunt resistor or use a lower-gain version with the chosen sense resistor to avoid this mode of operation. \nIf a differential overload occurs in a fault event, then the output of the INAx180 return to the expected value \napproximately 20 µs after the fault condition is removed.\nWhen the INAx180 output is driven to either the supply rail or ground, increasing the differential input voltage \ndoes not damage the device as long as the absolute maximum ratings are not violated. Following these \nguidelines, the INAx180 output maintains polarity, and does not suffer from phase reversal.\n8.4.3 Shutdown Mode\nAlthough the INAx180 do not have a shutdown pin, the low power consumption of the device allows the output \nof a logic gate or transistor switch to power the INAx180. This gate or switch turns on and off the INAx180 \npower-supply quiescent current.\nHowever, in current shunt monitoring applications, there is also a concern for how much current is drained \nfrom the shunt circuit in shutdown conditions. Evaluating this current drain involves considering the simplified \nschematic of the INAx180 in shutdown mode, as shown in Figure 8-6 .\nCBYPASS\n0.1 µFVS\n2.7 V to 5.5 V\nShutdownRPULL-UP\n10 k\r\nSingle-Channel \nTI DeviceRSENSE\nGNDVSLoad\nIN±\nIN+OUT\n+±Bus Voltage\n±0.2 V to +26 V\nRSENSE\nLoad\nOutput\nFigure 8-6. Basic Circuit to Shut Down the INxA180\nThere is typically more than 500 kΩ of impedance (from the combination of 500-kΩ feedback and\ninput gain set resistors) from each input of the INAx180 to the OUT pin and to the GND pin. The amount of \ncurrent flowing through these pins depends on the voltage at the connection.\nRegarding the 500-kΩ path to the output pin, the output stage of a disabled INAx180 does constitute a good path \nto ground. Consequently, this current is directly proportional to a shunt common-mode voltage present across a \n500-kΩ resistor.\nAs a final note, as long as the shunt common-mode voltage is greater than V S when the device is powered up, \nthere is an additional and well-matched 55-µA typical current that flows in each of the inputs. If less than V S, the \ncommon-mode input currents are negligible, and the only current effects are the result of the 500-kΩ resistors.INA180, INA2180, INA4180\nSBOS741H – APRIL 2017 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: INA180  INA2180  INA4180\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

However, there are practical limits as to how large the current-sense \nresistor can be in a given application. The INAx180 have a typical input bias currents of 80 µA for each input \nwhen operated at a 12-V common-mode voltage input. When large current-sense resistors are used, these \nbias currents cause increased offset error and reduced common-mode rejection. Therefore, using current-sense \nresistors larger than a few ohms is generally not recommended for applications that require current-monitoring \naccuracy. A second common restriction on the value of the current-sense resistor is the maximum allowable \npower dissipation that is budgeted for the resistor. Equation 1  gives the maximum value for the current sense \nresistor for a given power dissipation budget:\nMAX\nSENSE 2\nMAXPDR\nI\x1f\n(1)\nwhere:\n•PDMAX is the maximum allowable power dissipation in R SENSE .\n•IMAX is the maximum current that will flow through R SENSE .\nAn additional limitation on the size of the current-sense resistor and device gain is due to the power-supply \nvoltage, V S, and device swing to rail limitations. In order to make sure that the current-sense signal is properly \npassed to the output, both positive and negative output swing limitations must be examined. Equation 2  provides \nthe maximum values of R SENSE  and GAIN to keep the device from hitting the positive swing limitation.\nMAX SENSE SPI R GAIN Vu u \x1f\n(2)\nwhere:\n•IMAX is the maximum current that will flow through R SENSE .\n•GAIN is the gain of the current sense-amplifier.\n•VSP is the positive output swing as specified in the data sheet.\nTo avoid positive output swing limitations when selecting the value of R SENSE , there is always a trade-off \nbetween the value of the sense resistor and the gain of the device under consideration. If the sense resistor \nselected for the maximum power dissipation is too large, then it is possible to select a lower-gain device in order \nto avoid positive swing limitations.\nThe negative swing limitation places a limit on how small of a sense resistor can be used in a given application. \nEquation 3  provides the limit on the minimum size of the sense resistor.\nMIN SENSE SNI R GAIN > Vu u \n(3)\nwhere:\n•IMIN is the minimum current that will flow through R SENSE .\n•GAIN is the gain of the current sense amplifier.\n•VSN is the negative output swing of the device (see Rail-to-Rail Output Swing ).INA180, INA2180, INA4180\nSBOS741H – APRIL 2017 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: INA180  INA2180  INA4180\n9.1.3 Signal Filtering\nProvided that the INAx180 output is connected to a high impedance input, the best location to filter is at the \ndevice output using a simple RC network from OUT to GND. Filtering at the output attenuates high-frequency \ndisturbances in the common-mode voltage, differential input signal, and INAx180 power-supply voltage. If \nfiltering at the output is not possible, or filtering of only the differential input signal is required, it is possible \nto apply a filter at the input pins of the device. Figure 9-2  provides an example of how a filter can be used on the \ninput pins of the device.\nVOUTVS\n2.7 V to 5.5 V\nBiasIN±\nIN+VS\nOUTSingle-Channel \nTI DeviceRF < 10 \r RINT\nCF\nRF < 10 \r RINT+±Bus Voltage\n±0.2 V to +26 V\nRSENSE\nLoad\nGNDf±3dB3dB\nF F F1f2 (R R )C\x10 S \x0e \nFigure 9-2. Filter at Input Pins\nThe addition of external series resistance creates an additional error in the measurement; therefore, the value \nof these series resistors must be kept to 10 Ω (or less, if possible) to reduce impact to accuracy. The internal \nbias network shown in Figure 9-2  present at the input pins creates a mismatch in input bias currents when a \ndifferential voltage is applied between the input pins. If additional external series filter resistors are added to \nthe circuit, the mismatch in bias currents results in a mismatch of voltage drops across the filter resistors. This \nmismatch creates a differential error voltage that subtracts from the voltage developed across the shunt resistor. \nThis error results in a voltage at the device input pins that is different than the voltage developed across the \nshunt resistor. Without the additional series resistance, the mismatch in input bias currents has little effect on \ndevice operation. The amount of error these external filter resistors add to the measurement can be calculated \nusing Equation 5 , where the gain error factor is calculated using Equation 4 .\nThe amount of variance in the differential voltage present at the device input relative to the voltage developed \nat the shunt resistor is based both on the external series resistance (R F) value as well as internal input resistor \nRINT, as shown in Figure 9-2 . The reduction of the shunt voltage reaching the device input pins appears as a \ngain error when comparing the output voltage relative to the voltage across the shunt resistor.

Low-Side Sensing\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThe design requirements for the circuit shown in Figure 9-3 , are listed in Table 9-3\nTable 9-3. Design Parameters\nDESIGN PARAMETER EXAMPLE VALUE\nPower-supply voltage, V S 5 V\nLow-side current sensing VCM = 0 V\nRSENSE  power loss < 900 mW\nMaximum sense current, I MAX 40 A\nCurrent sensing error Less than 1.5% at maximum current, T J = 25°C\nSmall-signal bandwidth > 80 kHz\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nThe maximum value of the current sense resistor is calculated based on the maximum power loss requirement. \nBy applying Equation 1 , the maximum value of the current-sense resistor is calculated to be 0.563 m Ω. This is \nthe maximum value for sense resistor R SENSE ; therefore, select R SENSE  to be 0.5 m Ω because it is the closest \nstandard resistor value that meets the power-loss requirement.\nThe next step is to select the appropriate gain and reduce R SENSE , if needed, to keep the output signal swing \nwithin the V S range. Using Equation 2 , and given that I MAX = 40 A and R SENSE  = 0.5 m Ω, the maximum \ncurrent-sense gain calculated to avoid the positive swing-to-rail limitations on the output is 248.5. To maximize \nthe output signal range, the INA180A4 (gain = 200) device is selected for this application.\nTo calculate the accuracy at peak current, the two factors that must be determined are the gain error and the \noffset error. The gain error of the INAx180 is specified to be a maximum of 1%. The error due to the offset is \nconstant, and is specified to be 125 µV (maximum) for the conditions where V CM = 0 V and V S = 5 V. Using \nEquation 6 , the percentage error contribution of the offset voltage is calculated to be 0.75%, with total offset error \n= 150 µV, R SENSE  = 0.5 mΩ, and I SENSE  = 40 A.\nSENSE SENSETotal Offset Error (V)Total Offset Error (%) = 100%I R uu\n(6)www.ti.comINA180, INA2180, INA4180\nSBOS741H – APRIL 2017 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: INA180  INA2180  INA4180\nOne method of calculating the total error is to add the gain error to the percentage contribution of the offset error. \nHowever, in this case, the gain error and the offset error do not have an influence or correlation to each other. A \nmore statistically accurate method of calculating the total error is to use the RSS sum of the errors, as shown in \nEquation 7 :\n2 2 Total Error (%) = Total Gain Error (%)  + Total Offse t Error (%)\n(7)\nAfter applying Equation 7 , the total current sense error at maximum current is calculated to be 1.25%, and that is \nless than the design example requirement of 1.5%.\nThe INA180A4 (gain = 200) also has a bandwidth of 105 kHz that meets the small-signal bandwidth requirement \nof 80 kHz. If higher bandwidth is required, lower-gain devices can be used at the expense of either reduced \noutput voltage range or an increased value of R SENSE .\n9.2.3 Application Curve\nFigure 9-4  shows an example output response of a unidirectional configuration. The device output swing is \nlimited by ground; therefore, the output is biased to this zero output level. The output rises above ground for \npositive differential input signals, but cannot fall below ground for negative differential input signals.\nOutput Voltage (1 V/div)\nTime (500 µs/div)Output\nGround0 V\nFigure 9-4. Output Response\n9.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe input circuitry of the INAx180 accurately measures beyond the power-supply voltage, V S. For example, V S \ncan be 5 V, whereas the bus supply voltage at IN+ and IN– can be as high as 26 V. However, the output voltage \nrange of the OUT pin is limited by the voltages on the VS pin. The INAx180 also withstand the full differential \ninput signal range up to 26 V at the IN+ and IN– input pins, regardless of whether or not the device has power \napplied at the VS pin.\n9.3.1 Common-Mode Transients Greater Than 26 V\nWith a small amount of additional circuitry, the INAx180 can be used in circuits subject to transients higher than \n26 V, such as automotive applications. Use only Zener diodes or Zener-type transient absorbers (sometimes \nreferred to as transzorbs )—any other type of transient absorber has an unacceptable time delay. Start by adding \na pair of resistors as a working impedance for the Zener diode, as shown Figure 9-5 . Keep these resistors as \nsmall as possible; most often, around 10 Ω. Larger values can be used with an effect on gain that is discussed \nin the Signal Filtering  section. This circuit limits only short-term transients; therefore, many applications are \nsatisfied with a 10- Ω resistor along with conventional Zener diodes of the lowest acceptable power rating. This \ncombination uses the least amount of board space. These diodes can be found in packages as small as\nSOT-523 or SOD-523.INA180, INA2180, INA4180\nSBOS741H – APRIL 2017 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: INA180  INA2180  INA4180\nIN±\nIN+\nGNDVS\nOUT\n+±Single-Channel \nTI DeviceVS\n2.7 V to 5.5 V\nOutputRPROTECT\n< 10 \rRSENSEBus Supply\n±0.2 V to +26 V\nLoadCBYPASS\n0.1 µFFigure 9-5. Transient Protection Using Dual Zener Diodes\nIn the event that low-power Zener diodes do not have sufficient transient absorption capability, a higher-power \ntranszorb must be used. The most package-efficient solution involves using a single transzorb and back-to-back \ndiodes between the device inputs, as shown in Figure 9-6 . The most space-efficient solutions are dual, series-\nconnected diodes in a single SOT-523 or SOD-523 package. In either of the examples shown in Figure 9-5  and \nFigure 9-6 , the total board area required by the INAx180 with all protective components is less than that of an \nSO-8 package, and only slightly greater than that of an MSOP-8 package.\nTransorbOutputIN±\nIN+\nGNDOUT\n+±< 10 \r\n< 10 \rVSVS\n2.7 V to 5.5 V CBYPASS\n0.1 µF\nRSENSEBus Supply\n±0.2 V to +26 V\nLoad\nSingle-Channel \nTI Device\nFigure 9-6.

This connection technique \nmakes sure that only the current-sensing resistor impedance is detected between the input pins. Poor routing \nof the current-sensing resistor commonly results in additional resistance present between the input pins. \nGiven the very low ohmic value of the current resistor, any additional high-current carrying impedance can \ncause significant measurement errors.\n•Place the power-supply bypass capacitor as close as possible to the device power supply and ground pins. \nThe recommended value of this bypass capacitor is 0.1 µF. Additional decoupling capacitance can be added \nto compensate for noisy or high-impedance power supplies.\n•When routing the connections from the current sense resistor to the device, keep the trace lengths as close \nas possible in order to minimize any impedance mismatch.www.ti.comINA180, INA2180, INA4180\nSBOS741H – APRIL 2017 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: INA180  INA2180  INA4180\n9.4.2 Layout Examples\n123\n54\nGNDIN± IN+\nCurrent \nSenseOUT VSRSHUNTDirection Current Flow\nVIA to Ground \nPlane\nPower Supply, V S:\n2.7 V to 5.5 V CBYPASSBus Voltage:\n±0.2 V to +26 V \nFigure 9-7.
