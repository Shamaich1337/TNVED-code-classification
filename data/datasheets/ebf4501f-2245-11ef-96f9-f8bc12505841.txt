When\nconfigured in Input Mode, the FXL6408 monitors the input ports fordata transitions and signals the baseband by asserting the INT\n pin. The\ninput default values can be programmed independently, allowingcustomized input detection. All inputs can be configured with pull−up\nor pull−down resistors to pre −bias the inputs in open −drain or\nnon−driven applications. When configured in Output Mode, the GPIO\npins are capable of delivering 6 mA output drive according to the I\n2C\nregister set.

The FXL6408 can accept clock signals with LOW as low as 1.1 /C0109s, provided that the received SDA signal t HD;DAT  + tr/f ≤1.1 /C0109s. The FXL6408\nfeatures a 0 ns SDA input setup time and, therefore, this parameter is not included in the above equation.\n5. A Fast −Mode I2C−Bus® device can be used in a Standard −Mode I2C−Bus system, but the requirement t SU;DAT  ≥250 ns must be met. This\nis automatically the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the LO W period of\nthe SCL signal. It must output the next data bit to the SDA line t r_max  + tSU;DAT  = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the Standard −Mode\nI2C bus specification) before the SCL line is released.\n6. C b equals the total capacitance of one bus line in pF. If mixed with High −Speed Mode devices, faster fall times are allowed, according to the\nI2C specification.\n7. The FXL6408 ensures that the SDA signal out must coincide with SCL LOW for worst −case SCL t f maximum times of 300 ns. This\nrequirement prevents data loss by preventing SDA out transitions during the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL. Consequently, the\nFXL6408 fulfils the following requirement from the I2C specification, note 2 on page 77: “A device must internally provide a hold time of at\nleast 300 ns for the SDA signal (referred to the V IHmin  of the SCL signal) to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.”\n8.

Definition of Timing for Full −Speed Mode Devices on the I2C Bus\nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\nOverview\nThe FXL6408 I/O expander frees up six ports of the\ncentral processor to be dedicated for more critical functions.\nThe FXL6408 enables the addition of eightGeneral−Purpose Input / Output (GPIO) ports to a system\nprocessor while using two I/O ports for I\n2C control (net six\nadditional I/Os). The device can be used in multiple\napplications, from button monitoring to driving control pins\nof other ICs in the system. It also allows the system designerto add new features and functions quickly without upgradingthe central processor. The FXL6408 includes eight I/O pinscontrolled by an integrated I\n2C slave and allows the central\nprocessor to control each I/O independently. Whenconfigured as outputs, each pin can deliver up to 6 mA drive.\nWhen configured as inputs, the default state can be\nindependently configured. In addition, the FXL6408 hasintegrated pull−up and pull −down resistors that are enabled\nvia I\n2C commands in the register map. This allows the\nsystem designer to pre −bias the inputs to a known level to\nallow use with un −driven input signals.\nInterrupt Operation\nThe INT  pin is a LOW −asserted open −drain output and\nrequires an external pull −up resistor. The FXL6408 signals\nan interrupt to the processor when an event occurs, removingthe need for the processor to continuously poll the FXL6408registers. Immediately after detecting a change at an input,the FXL6408 writes the corresponding bit in the input\ninterrupt status register (13\nh) and asserts the INT  pin by\npulling it LOW. The interrupt status register bit remainsHIGH until the processor reads the register and clears the bit.\nIf the input pin remains in the non −default state after the\ninterrupt has been serviced, a new interrupt is not generated\nuntil after the input state has first returned to its default state\nand changed back to its non −default state. The FXL6408\nalso contains an Input Status register (0F\nh) used to verify the\ncurrent status of the given input at the time when theinterrupt is serviced by the processor. These two registers\nallow the processor to determine the following informationabout any input every time the register map is read:\n•If the input state changed from the default state since\nthe most recent register read; and\n•The current state of the input pin.\nThe interrupt output INT , once asserted, is held LOW until\nthe interrupt is serviced by the processor. This means that the\nsystem uses level −sensitive interrupts. Interrupt signaling is\nasynchronous to the SCL signal.\nDevice Reset\nThe FXL6408 has three reset options, all of which cause\nthe part to reset all register settings to their default states.Immediately after device reset, the RST_INT bit in theDevice ID & Ctrl register (01h) is HIGH and an interruptsignal is generated by the FXL6408. After the processorreads the register, this bit is cleared and, on future registerreads, the processor can verify that the FXL6408 has notbeen reset if this bit remains LOW. Following are\ndescriptions of the three reset methods.\nPower−On Reset (POR)\nOn device power −up, when V\nCC reaches V POR or if the\nVCC supply voltage drops below V POR during operation,\nthe FXL6408 immediately resets.\nSoftware Reset\nThe FXL6408 can be reset by the processor using an I2C\nwrite command to change bit 0 of register 01h to a 1.Immediately following this change, the FXL6408 resets and\nall register values return to their default values. In this case,the SW_RST bit returns to 0 as soon as the reset sequenceis completed.\nReset Pin\nThe FXL6408 is reset when the RST\n pin (C3) is pulled\nLOW.\nFXL6408\nwww. onsemi.com\n8Translation\nThe FXL6408 has the ability to translate between the\nsystem I2C voltage reference and the I/O voltage reference.\nThe V CC pin is used both as the FXL6408 power supply\nas well as the voltage reference for the I2C inputs, ADDR,\nINT and RESET pins. The V DDIO  pin is used only for the\nvoltage supply reference of the I/O ports. For example,\na 1.8 V−referenced I2C Bus can be used to interface\nwith the FXL6408 and control 3.6 V −referenced I/Os\nby supplying V CC = 1.8 V and V DDIO  = 3.6 V . If translationis not needed, the system provides the same voltage to both\nthe V CC and V DDIO  pins. If both the I/O and I2C interfaces\nare referenced to 1.8 V , the V CC supply and V DDIO  pin\nshould both be tied to 1.8 V .\nI2C Read / Write Procedures\nFigure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate compatible I2C write and\nread sequences. The FXL6408 does not support burst reador write optional modes described in the I\n2C standard.\nFigure 7.

### Component Summary: FXL6408UMX

**Description:**
The FXL6408 is a fully configurable 8-bit GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) expander controlled via I2C. It allows for the addition of eight GPIO ports to a system processor, enabling the monitoring of input states and control of output states. The device is designed to facilitate voltage translation between different logic levels, making it versatile for various applications.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 1.65 V to 3.60 V
  - I/O Reference Voltage (VDDIO): 1.65 V to 4.00 V
  - Absolute Maximum Ratings: VCC, VDDIO: -0.5 V to 4.6 V; VIN: -0.5 V to 4.0 V; VOUT: -0.5 V to 4.0 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Drive Current: 6 mA per GPIO pin
  - Input Leakage Current: ±1 µA (typical)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Low-Power Quiescent Current: 1.5 µA (typical in standby mode)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +85 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - 16-Lead Ultra-thin Molded Leadless Package (UQFN16), dimensions: 1.80 x 2.60 mm

- **Special Features:**
  - Fully integrated I2C slave controller
  - 8 independently configurable I/O ports
  - Active LOW reset input and Power-On Reset (POR) circuit
  - Selectable device address for I2C communication
  - Integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors for input configuration
  - Interrupt pin to signal the processor of status changes

- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - JEDEC J-STD-020E: Level 1

**Typical Applications:**
The FXL6408 is suitable for a variety of applications, including:
- **Button Monitoring:** Detecting user inputs from buttons or switches.
- **Control Interfaces:** Driving control pins for other integrated circuits in a system.
- **Peripheral Expansion:** Expanding the number of I/O ports available to a microcontroller or processor.
- **Voltage Level Translation:** Facilitating communication between devices operating at different voltage levels.
- **Embedded Systems:** Enhancing the functionality of embedded systems by adding GPIO capabilities without requiring additional processor resources.

This component is particularly useful in designs where the central processor needs to be freed up for more critical tasks while still maintaining control over multiple I/O functions.
