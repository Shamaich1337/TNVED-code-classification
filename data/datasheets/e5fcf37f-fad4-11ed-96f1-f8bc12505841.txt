The CMRR of instr umentation \namplifiers on the market today falls off at 200 Hz. In c ontrast, \nthe AD8221 maintains a minimum CMRR of 80 dB to 10 k Hz \nfor all grades at G = 1. High CMRR over frequency allows th e \nAD8221 to reject wideband interference and line harm onics, \ngreatly simplifying filter requirements. Possible applications \ninclude precision data acquisition, biomedical analysis, an d \naerospace instrumentation.

Typical CMRR vs. Frequency for G = 1 \n \nLow voltage offset, low offset drift, low gain drift, hi gh gain \naccuracy, and high CMRR make this part an excellent cho ice  \nin applications that demand the best dc performance po ssible, \nsuch as bridge signal conditioning. \nProgrammable gain affords the user design flexibility. A sing le \nresistor sets the gain from 1 to 1000. The AD8221 operat es on \nboth single and dual supplies and is well suited for applicati ons \nwhere ±10 V input voltages are encountered. \nThe AD8221 is available in a low cost 8-lead SOIC and 8-le ad \nMSOP , both of which offer the industry’s best performanc e. The \nMSOP requires half the board space of the SOIC, making it ideal \nfor multichannel or space-constrained applications.  \nPerformance is specified over the entire industrial tem perature \nrange of −40°C to +85°C for all grades. Furthermore , the AD8221 \nis operational from −40°C to +125°C 1. \n \n1 See Typical Performance Characteristics for expected  operation from  \n85°C to 125°C. \n \nAD8221    \n \nRev.

Simplified Schematic \n \nThe AD8221 is a monolithic instrumentation amplifier b ased \non the classic 3-op amp topology. Input transistors Q1 and Q2 \nare biased at a fixed current so that any different ial input signal \nforces the output voltages of A1 and A2 to change acco rdingly. \nA signal applied to the input creates a current through R G, R1, \nand R2, such that the outputs of A1 and A2 deliver the correct \nvoltage. Topologically, Q1, A1, R1 and Q2, A2, R2 can be \nviewed as precision current feedback amplifiers. The amp lified \ndifferential and common-mode signals are applied to a \ndifference amplifier that rejects the common-mode volt age  \nbut amplifies the differential voltage. The difference a mplifier \nemploys innovations that result in low output offset vol tage as \nwell as low output offset voltage drift. Laser-trimmed re sistors \nallow for a highly accurate in-amp with gain error typ ically less \nthan 20 ppm and CMRR that exceeds 90 dB (G = 1). \nUsing superbeta input transistors and an I B compensation \nscheme, the AD8221 offers extremely high input impeda nce, \nlow I B, low I B drift, low I OS , low input bias current noise, and \nextremely low voltage noise of 8 nV/√Hz. \nThe transfer function of the AD8221 is \nGRGkΩ4 . 49 1\x0e  \nUsers can easily and accurately set the gain using a sing le \nstandard resistor. Because the input amplifiers employ a current feedback  \narchitecture, the gain-bandwidth product of the AD822 1 \nincreases with gain, resulting in a system that does not suff er \nfrom the expected bandwidth loss of voltage feedback \narchitectures at higher gains. \nTo maintain precision even at low input levels, special att ention \nwas given to the design and layout of the AD8221, resultin g in \nan in-amp whose performance satisfies the most demandi ng \napplications. \nA unique pinout enables the AD8221 to meet a CMRR \nspecification of 80 dB at 10 kHz (G = 1) and 110 dB at 1 kHz  \n(G = 1000). The balanced pinout, shown in Figure 44, redu ces \nthe parasitics that had, in the past, adversely affected CMRR \nperformance. In addition, the new pinout simplifies boa rd \nlayout because associated traces are grouped together. F or \nexample, the gain setting resistor pins are adjacent to th e  \ninputs, and the reference pin is next to the output.  \n8\n7\n6\n51\n2\n3\n4–IN \nRG\nRG+V S\nVOUT \nREF \n–V S +IN \nTOP VIEW AD8221 \n03149-043  \nFigure 44.

Gain error and gain drif t are kept \nto a minimum when the gain resistor is not used. \nLAYOUT \nCareful board layout maximizes system performance. Traces \nfrom the gain setting resistor to the R G pins should be kept as \nshort as possible to minimize parasitic inductance. To ensu re \nthe most accurate output, the trace from the REF pin should \neither be connected to the local ground of the AD82 21, as shown  \nin Figure 47, or connected to a voltage that is referen ced to the \nlocal ground of the AD8221. \nCommon-Mode Rejection \nOne benefit of the high CMRR over frequency of the A D8221 is \nthat it has greater immunity to disturbances, such as lin e noise \nand its associated harmonics, than do typical instrument ation \namplifiers. Typically, these amplifiers have CMRR fall-of f at \n200 Hz; common-mode filters are often used to compens ate for \nthis shortcoming. The AD8221 is able to reject CMRR over a \ngreater frequency range, reducing the need for filteri ng. \nA well implemented layout helps to maintain the high CMR R \nover frequency of the AD8221. Input source impedance  and \ncapacitance should be closely matched. In addition, sour ce \nresistance and capacitance should be placed as close to t he \ninputs as permissible. \n \n Grounding \nThe output voltage of the AD8221 is developed with resp ect to \nthe potential on the reference terminal. Care should be taken to \ntie REF to the appropriate local ground.  \nIn mixed-signal environments, low level analog signals need to \nbe isolated from the noisy digital environment. Many AD Cs \nhave separate analog and digital ground pins. Although it i s \nconvenient to tie both grounds to a single ground plane, t he \ncurrent traveling through the ground wires and PC boar d may \ncause hundreds of millivolts of error. Therefore, separa te analog \nand digital ground returns should be used to minimize the  \ncurrent flow from sensitive points to the system ground. An \nexample layout is shown in Figure 45 and Figure 46. \n03149-044  \nFigure 45. Top Layer of the AD8221-EVAL \n \n03149-045  \nFigure 46.

The output of the instrumentat ion \namplifier is referenced to the voltage on the REF ter minal; this \nis useful when the output signal needs to be offset to a precise \nmidsupply level. For example, a voltage source can be tied  to the \nREF pin to level-shift the output so that the AD8221  can interface \nwith an ADC. The allowable reference voltage range is a function \nof the gain, input, and supply voltage. The REF pin should  not \nexceed either +V S or –VS by more than 0.5 V .  \nFor best performance, source impedance to the REF ter minal \nshould be kept low, because parasitic resistance can adver sely \naffect CMRR and gain accuracy.  \nPOWER SUPPLY REGULATION AND BYPASSING \nA stable dc voltage should be used to power the ins trumentation \namplifier. Noise on the supply pins can adversely affe ct \nperformance. Bypass capacitors should be used to decouple  \nthe amplifier. \nA 0.1 µF capacitor should be placed close to each supply pin.  \nAs shown in Figure 47, a 10 µF tantalum capacitor can b e used \nfurther away from the part.

In addition, the input structure allo ws for \ndc overload conditions below the negative supply, −VS. The \ninternal 400 Ω resistors limit current in the event of a  negative \nfault condition. However, in the case of a dc overload voltage \nabove the positive supply, +V S, a large current flows directly \nthrough the ESD diode to the positive rail. Therefor e, an external \nresistor should be used in series with the input to limit  current \nfor voltages above +Vs. In either scenario, the AD8221 c an \nsafely handle a continuous 6 mA current, I = V IN /R EXT  for \npositive overvoltage and I = V IN /(400 Ω + R EXT ) for negative \novervoltage.  \nFor applications where the AD8221 encounters extreme \noverload voltages, as in cardiac defibrillators, external se ries \nresistors, and low leakage diode clamps, such as BAV199Ls, \nFJH1100s, or SP720s should be used.  \n \n \n \n \nAD8221    \n \nRev.

Mismatch between the R × C C at the positive input and the \nR × C C at the negative input degrades the CMRR of the AD8 221. \nBy using a value of C D one magnitude larger than C C, the effect \nof the mismatch is reduced, and therefore, performance is \nimproved.  \nPRECISION STRAIN GAGE \nThe low offset and high CMRR over frequency of the A D8221 \nmake it an excellent candidate for bridge measurements.

Interfacing a ±10 V , single-ended instrumentation  \namplifier to a +5 V , differential ADC can be a challeng e. \nInterfacing the instrumentation amplifier to the ADC  requires \nattenuation and a level shift.

The output signal of the instrumentation amplifi er is \ntaken across the OUT pin and the REF pin. Two 1 kΩ resist ors \nand a 499 Ω resistor attenuate the ±10 V signal to +4 V . An \noptional capacitor, C1, can serve as an antialiasing filte r. An \nAD8022 is used to drive the ADC. \nThis topology has five benefits. In addition to level-shif ting and \nattenuation, very little noise is contributed to the syst em. Noise \nfrom R1 and R2 is common to both of the inputs of the  ADC \nand is easily rejected. R5 adds a third of the dominant  noise and \ntherefore makes a negligible contribution to the noise of the \nsystem. The attenuator divides the noise from R3 an d R4. Likewise, \nits noise contribution is negligible. The fourth benefit of this \ninterface circuit is that the acquisition time of the  AD8221 is \nreduced by a factor of 2. With the help of the OP27, the AD8221 \nonly needs to deliver one-half of the full swing; t herefore, signals \ncan settle more quickly. Lastly, the AD8022 settles quickl y, \nwhich is helpful because the shorter the settling time, t he  \nmore bits that can be resolved when the ADC acquires data. \nThis configuration provides attenuation, a level-shift, an d a \nconvenient interface with a differential input ADC w hile \nmaintaining performance. \nAC-COUPLED INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER \nMeasuring small signals that are in the noise or offset of t he \namplifier can be a challenge. Figure 52 shows a circuit t hat can \nimprove the resolution of small ac signals. The large gain reduces the referred input noise of the amplifier to  8 nV/√Hz. \nThus, smaller signals can be measured because the noise floor is \nlower. DC offsets that would have been gained by 100 are  \neliminated from the output of the AD8221 by the inte grator \nfeedback network.  \nAt low frequencies, the OP1177  forces the output of the AD8221 to \n0 V . Once a signal exceeds f HIGH-PASS , the AD8221 outputs the \namplified input signal. \nAD8221 \nOP1177 R\n15.8k \x9f+V S\n+IN \n–IN \n0.1µF 0.1µF \n0.1µF 0.1µF \n10µF 10µF REF C\n1µF \n–V S\n–V S +V S+V S\n–V SR\n499 \x9f1\n\x15ʌ5& fHIGH-PASS  = \n03149-051 \n \nFigure 52.
