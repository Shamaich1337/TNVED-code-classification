External component selection isdetermined by the maximum load current and begins withthe selection of the inductor value and operating frequency\nfollowed by C\nIN and C OUT.\nMain Control Loop\nDuring normal operation, the internal upper power switch\n(P-MOSFET) is turned on at the beginning of each clockcycle. Current in the inductor increases until the peakinductor current reaches the value defined by the outputvoltage (V\nCOMP) of the error amplifier. The error amplifier\nadjusts its output voltage by comparing the feedback signalfrom a resistive voltage-divider on the FB pin with aninternal 0.8V reference. When the load current increases,it causes a reduction in the feedback voltage relative tothe reference. The error amplifier increases its outputvoltage until the average inductor current matches the newload current. When the upper power MOSFET shuts off,the lower synchronous power switch (N-MOSFET) turns\non until the beginning of the next clock cycle.\nOutput Voltage Setting\nThe output voltage is set by an external resistive voltage-\ndivider according to the following equation :\n\uf0b4OUT REFR1V =  V ( 1 + )R2\nwhere V REF equals to 0.8V typical.\nThe resistive voltage-divider allows the FB pin to sense a\nfraction of the output voltage as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Setting the Output VoltageSoft-Start\nThe RT8070 provides adjustable soft-start function. The\nsoft-start function is used to prevent large inrush currentwhile converter is being powered-up. For the RT8070, thesoft-start timing can be programmed by the externalcapacitor C\nSS between SS pin and ground. An internal\ncurrent source I SS (10μA) charges an external capacitor\nto build a soft-start ramp voltage. The V FB will track the\ninternal ramp voltage during soft start interval. The typicalsoft-start time is that V\nOUT rises from zero to 90% of setting\nvalue and can be calculated by the equation below :\nR1\nGNDRT8070VOUT\nR2FBPower Good Output\nThe power good output is an open-drain output and requires\na pull up resistor. When the output voltage is 12.5% aboveor 12.5% below its set voltage, PGOOD will be pulledlow. It is held low until the output voltage returns to withinthe allowed tolerances once more. During soft-start,PGOOD is actively held low and is only allowed to transitionhigh when soft-start is over and the output voltage reaches87.5% of its set voltage.\nSwitching Frequency Setting\nThe RT8070 offers adjustable switching frequency setting\nand the switching frequency can be set by using externalresistor RT. Switching frequency range is from 200kHz to2MHz. Selection of the operating frequency is a tradeoffbetween efficiency and component size. High frequencyoperation allows the use of smaller inductor and capacitorvalues. Operation at lower frequencies improves efficiencyby reducing internal gate charge and transition losses,but requires larger inductance values and capacitance tomaintain low output ripple voltage. An additional constrainton operating frequency are the minimum on-time andminimum off-time. The minimum on-time, t\nON_MIN , is the\nsmallest duration of time in which the high-side switchcan be in its “on” state. This time is 90ns (typically). In\ncontinuous mode operation, the minimum on-time limitimposes a maximum operating frequency, f\nSW_MAX , of :\nfSW_MAX  = V OUT / (tON_MIN  x V IN_MAX )SS SS\nSS0.8t =  CI\uf0b4\nRT8070\n10DS8070-09   November  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.

Switching Frequency vs. R RT Resistor\nInductor Selection\nFor a given input and output voltage, the inductor value\nand operating frequency determine the ripple current. Theripple current, ΔI\nL, increases with higher V IN and decreases\nwith higher inductance\nOUT OUT\nL\nINVVI =   1fL V\uf0e9\uf0f9 \uf0e9\uf0f9\uf044\uf02d \uf0ea\uf0fa \uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0b4\uf0eb\uf0fb \uf0eb\uf0fb\nHaving a lower ripple current reduces not only the ESR\nlosses in the output capacitors but also the output voltageripple. Highest efficiency operation is achieved by reducingripple current at low frequency, but attaining this goalrequires a large inductor.\nFor the ripple current selection, the value of ΔI\nL = 0.4(I MAX)\nis a reasonable starting point. The largest ripple currentoccurs at the highest V\nIN. To guarantee that the ripple\ncurrent stays below a specified maximum value, theinductor value needs to be chosen according to the followingequation :OUT OUT\nL(MAX) IN(MAX)VVL =  1fI V\uf0e9\uf0f9 \uf0e9\uf0f9\n\uf02d \uf0ea\uf0fa \uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0b4\uf044\uf0ea\uf0fa \uf0ea\uf0fa\uf0eb\uf0fb \uf0eb\uf0fb\nUsing Ceramic Input and Output Capacitors\nHigher values, lower cost ceramic capacitors are now\nbecoming available in smaller case sizes. Their high ripplecurrent, high voltage rating and low ESR make them idealfor switching regulator applications. However, care mustbe taken when these capacitors are used at the input andoutput. When a ceramic capacitor is used at the inputand the power is supplied by a wall adapter through longwires, a load step at the output can induce ringing at theinput. At best, this ringing can couple to the output andbe mistaken as loop instability. At worst, a sudden inrushof current through the long wires can potentially cause avoltage spike at V\nIN large enough to damage the part.\nSlope Compensation and Peak Inductor Current\nSlope compensation provides stability in constant\nfrequency architectures by preventing sub- harmonicoscillations at duty cycles greater than 50%. It isaccomplished internally by adding a compensating rampto the inductor current signal. Normally, the peak inductorcurrent is reduced when slope compensation is added.For the IC, however, separated inductor current signal isused to monitor over-current condition, so the maximumoutput current stays relatively constant regardless of theduty cycle.\nHiccup Mode Under-Voltage Protection\nA Hiccup Mode under-voltage protection (UVP) function\nis provided for the IC. When the FB voltage drops belowhalf of the feedback reference voltage, V\nFB, the UVP\nfunction is triggered to auto re-soft-start the power stageuntil this event is cleared. The Hiccup Mode UVP reducesthe input current in short circuit conditions, but will not betriggered during soft-start process.\nUnder-Voltage Lockout Threshold\nThe RT8070 includes an input under-voltage lockout\nprotection (UVLO) function. If the input voltage exceedsthe UVLO rising threshold voltage, the converter will resetand prepare the PWM for operation. However, if the inputwhere V\nIN_MAX  is the maximum operating input voltage.\nThrough external resistor RT connect between RT pin and\nground to set the switching frequency f SW. The equation\nbelow shows the relation between setting frequency andRT value.\nThe switching frequency vs R\nRT value can be short with\nthe formula below : f SW (MHz) = K x 0.9 / R RT (kΩ),\nwhere K = 3.67 x 105\nNote that the variation of f SW is ±15%.\nRT8070\n11DS8070-09   November  2020 www.richtek.com\n© Copyright   2020 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The UVLOrising and falling threshold voltage has a hysteresis toprevent noise caused reset.\nOver-Temperature Protection\nThe RT8070 includes an over-temperature protection (OTP)\ncircuitry to prevent overheating due to excessive powerdissipation. The OTP will shut down switching operationwhen junction temperature exceeds a thermal shutdownthreshold T\nSD (150 °C). Once the junction temperature cools\ndown by a thermal shutdown hysteresis ( ΔTSD = 20 °C),\nthe IC will resume normal operation with a complete soft-start.\nThermal Considerations\nFor continuous operation, do not exceed absolute\nmaximum junction temperature. The maximum powerdissipation depends on the thermal resistance of the ICpackage, PCB layout, rate of surrounding airflow, anddifference between junction and ambient temperature. Themaximum power dissipation can be calculated by thefollowing formula :\nP\nD(MAX)  = (T J(MAX)  − TA) / θJA\nwhere T J(MAX)  is the maximum junction temperature, T A is\nthe ambient temperature, and θJA is the junction to ambient\nthermal resistance.\nFor recommended operating condition specifications, the\nmaximum junction temperature is 125 °C. The junction to\nambient thermal resistance, θJA, is layout dependent. For\nSOP-8 (Exposed Pad) packages, the thermal resistance,θ\nJA, is 75 °C/W on a standard JEDEC 51-7 four-layer\nthermal test board. For WDFN-8L 3x3 packages, thethermal resistance, θ\nJA, is 70 °C/W on a standard JEDEC\n51-7 four-layer thermal test board. The maximum powerdissipation at T\nA = 25 °C can be calculated by the following\nformulas :\nPD(MAX)  = (125 °C − 25°C) / (75 °C/W) = 1.333W for\nSOP-8 (Exposed Pad) package\nPD(MAX)  = (125 °C − 25°C) / (70 °C/W) = 1.429W for\nWDFN-8L 3x3 packageThe maximum power dissipation depends on the operating\nambient temperature for fixed T J(MAX)  and thermal\nresistance, θJA. The derating curves in Figure 3 allow the\ndesigner to see the effect of rising ambient temperatureon the maximum power dissipation.\nFigure 3.
