A resistor (RSET) is conne cted between this pin and AGND. This determines the \nmagnitude of the full-scale DAC current. The relationship between RSET and the full-scale current is  \nIOUT FULL-SCALE  = 12.5 ×  VREFIN/RSET, where  VREFIN = 1.21 V  nominal,  RSET = 3.9 kΩ  typical.  \n2 REFIN Voltage Reference Input. The AD9835 can be used with either the on-board reference, which is available from Pin \nREFOUT, or an external reference. The reference to be used is connected to the REFIN pin. The AD9835 accepts a \nreference of 1.21 V nominal. \n3 REFOUT Voltage Reference Output. The AD9835  has an on-board reference of value 1.21 V nominal. The reference is made \navailable on the REFOUT pin. This reference is used as the reference to the DAC by connecting REFOUT to REFIN. \nREFOUT should be decoupled with a 10 nF capacitor to AGND. \n14 IOUT Current Output. This is a high impeda nce current source. A load resistor should be connected between IOUT and \nAGND. \n16 COMP Compensation Pin. This is a compensation pin for the in ternal reference amplifier. A 10 nF decoupling ceramic \ncapacitor should be connected between COMP and AVDD. \nPOWER SUPPLY \n4 DVDD Positive Power Supply for the Digital Section. A 0.1 μF decoupling capacitor should be connected between DVDD and DGND. DVDD can have a value of +5 V ± 5%. \n5 DGND Digital Ground. \n13 AGND Analog Ground. \n15 AVDD Positive Power Supply for the Analog Section. A 0.1 μF  decoupling capacitor should be connected between AVDD \nand AGND. AVDD can have a value of +5 V ± 5%. \nDIGITAL INTERFACE AND CONTROL \n6 MCLK Digital Clock Input. DDS output frequencies are expressed as a binary fraction of the frequency of MCLK. The output frequency accuracy and phase no ise are determined by this clock. \n7 SCLK Serial Clock, Logic Input. Data is cl ocked into the AD9835 on each falling SCLK edge. \n8 SDATA Serial Data In, Logic Input. The 16-bit serial data word is applied to this input. \n9 FSYNC Data Synchronization Signal, Logic Input. When this input is taken low, the internal lo gic is informed that a new \nword is being loaded into the device. \n10 FSELECT Frequency Select Input. FSELECT controls which frequenc y register, FREQ0 or FREQ1, is used in the phase \naccumulator. The frequency register can be selected using the Pin FSELECT or the Bit FSELECT. FSELECT is sampled \non the rising MCLK edge. FSLECT needs to be in steady  state when an MCLK rising edge occurs. If FSELECT \nchanges value when a rising edge occurs, there is an uncertainty of one MCLK cycle as to when control is \ntransferred to the other frequency register. To avoid an y uncertainty, a change on FSELECT should not coincide \nwith an MCLK rising edge. When the bit is being used to  select the frequency register, the Pin FSELECT should be \ntied to DGND. \nAD9835  Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 8 of 28 Pin No. Mnemonic Description \n11, 12 PSEL0, \nPSEL1 Phase Select Input. The AD9835  has four phase registers. These registers can be used to alter the value being input \nto the COS ROM. The contents of the phase register ar e added to the phase accumulator output, the PSEL0 and \nPSEL1 inputs selecting the phase register to be used. Altern atively, the phase register to be used can be selected \nusing the PSEL0 and PSEL1 bits. Like the FSELECT input, PSEL0 and PSEL1 are sampled on the rising MCLK edge. \nTherefore, these inputs need to be in steady state when an  MCLK rising edge occurs or there is an uncertainty of \none MCLK cycle as to when control is transferred to th e selected phase register. When the phase registers are \nbeing controlled by the PSEL0 and PSEL1 bits, the pins should be tied to DGND. \n \n \n Data Sheet AD9835\n \nRev.

A | Page 12 of 28 TERMINOLOGY \nIntegral Nonlinearity \nThis is the maximum deviation of any code from a straight line \npassing through the endpoints of the transfer function. The endpoints of the transfer function are zero scale, a point 0.5 LSB below the first code transition (000 . . . 00 to 000 . . . 01) and full scale, a point 0.5 LSB above the last code transition (111 . . . 10 to 111 . . . 11). The error is expressed in LSBs. \nDifferential Nonlinearity \nThis is the difference between the measured and ideal 1 LSB \nchange between two adjacent codes in the DAC. \nSignal to (Noise + Distortion) \nSignal to (Noise + Distortion) is measured signal to noise at  the output of the DAC. The signal is the rms magnitude of the fundamental. Noise is the rms sum of all the non-fundamental signals up to half the sampling frequency (f\nMCLK/2) but excluding \nthe dc component. Signal to (Noise + Distortion) is dependent on the number of quantization levels used in the digitization process; the more levels, the smaller the quantization noise. The theoretical Signal to (Noise + Distortion) ratio for a sine wave \ninput is given by  \nSignal to (Noise + Distor tion) = (6.02N + 1.76) dB \nwhere N is the number of bits. Thus, for an ideal 10-bit converter, Signal to (Noise + Distortion) = 61.96 dB. Total Harmonic Distortion \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD) is the ratio of the rms sum of harmonics to the rms value of the fundamental. For the AD9835, \nTHD is defined as \n( )\n12\n62\n52\n42\n32\n2log 20VV V V V V\nTHD+ + + +\n=  \nwhere V1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental and V2, V3, \nV4, V5, and V 6 are the rms amplitudes of the second through the \nsixth harmonic. \nOutput Compliance \nThe output compliance refers to the maximum voltage that  \ncan be generated at the output of the DAC to meet the specifica-tions. When voltages greater than that specified for the output \ncompliance are generated, the AD9835 may not meet the \nspecifications listed in the data sheet. \nSpurious Free Dynamic Range \nAlong with the frequency of interest, harmonics of the funda-\nmental frequency and images of the MCLK frequency are present at the output of a DDS device. The spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) refers to the largest spur or harmonic present in \nthe band of interest. The wideband SFDR gives the magnitude \nof the largest harmonic or spur relative to the magnitude of the fundamental frequency in the bandwidth ±2 MHz about the fundamental frequency. The narrow band SFDR gives the attenuation of the largest spur or harmonic in a bandwidth  \nof ±50 kHz about the fundamental frequency. \nClock Feedthrough \nThere will be feedthrough from the MCLK input to the analog \noutput. Clock feedthrough refers to the magnitude of the MCLK \nsignal relative to the fundamental frequency in the AD9835’s \noutput spectrum. \n \n \n Data Sheet AD9835\n \nRev. A | Page 13 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION \nSine waves are typically thought of in terms of their magnitude \nform a(t) = sin (ωt). However, these are nonlinear and not easy to generate except through piecewise construction. On the other hand, the angular information is linear in nature. That is, \nthe phase angle rotates through a fixed angle for each unit of \ntime. The angular rate depends on the frequency of the signal \nby the traditional rate of ω = 2 πf. \nMAGNITUDE\nPHASE+1\n0\n–1\n2\n0\n09630-023 \nFigure 21. Sine Wave Knowing that the phase of a sine wave is linear and given a \nreference interval (clock period), the phase rotation for that \nperiod can be determined by \nΔPhase = ωδt  \nSolving for ω, \nω = ΔPhase/δ t = 2 πf \nSolving for f  and substituting the reference clock frequency for \nthe reference period (1/ fMCLK = δt), \nf = ΔPhase  × f MCLK/2 π \nThe AD9835 builds the output based on this simple equation. A \nsimple DDS chip can implement this equation with three major subcircuits. \n \nAD9835  Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 14 of 28 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD9835 provides an exciting level of integration for the  \nRF communications system designer. The AD9835  combines \nthe numerical controlled oscillator (NCO), COS lookup table, \nfrequency and phase modulators, and a digital-to- analog converter on a single integrated circuit. \nThe internal circuitry of the AD9835 consists of three main \nsections. These are \n• numerical controlled oscillator (NCO) and phase \nmodulator \n• COS lookup table \n• digital-to-analog converter \nThe AD9835 is a fully integrated direct digital synthesis (DDS) \nchip. The chip requires one reference clock, one low precision resistor, and eight decoupling capacitors to provide digitally-\ncreated sine waves up to 25 MHz. In addition to the generation of this RF signal, the chip is fully capable of a broad range of simple and complex modulation schemes. These modulation schemes are fully implemented in the digital domain allowing \naccurate and simple realization of complex modulation \nalgorithms using DSP techniques. \nNUMERICAL CONTROLLED OSCILLATOR AND \nPHASE MODULATOR \nThis consists of two frequency select registers, a phase accumulator \nand four phase offset registers. The main component of the NCO is \na 32-bit phase accumulator, which assembles the phase component of the output signal. Continuous time signals have a phase range of \n0 π to 2 π. Outside this range of numbers, the sinusoid functions \nrepeat themselves in a periodic manner.  \nThe digital implementation is no different. The accumulator \nsimply scales the range of phase numbers into a multibit  digital word. The phase accumulator in the AD9835 is \nimplemented with 32 bits. Therefore, in the AD9835, 2 π = 2\n32. \nLikewise, the Δ Phase  term is scaled into this range of numbers  \n0 < Δ Phase  < 232 − 1. Making these substitutions into the \nequation above \nf = ΔPhase  × f MCLK/232 \nwhere  \n0 < Δ Phase  < 232 The input to the phase accumulator (that is, the phase step)  \ncan be selected either from the FREQ0 register or FREQ1 register and this is controlled by the FSELECT pin or the FSELECT bit. NCOs inherently generate continuous phase \nsignals, thus avoiding any output discontinuity when switching \nbetween frequencies. \nFollowing the NCO, a phase offset can be added to perform phase \nmodulation using the 12-bit PHASE registers. The contents of this register are added to the most significant bits of the NCO. The AD9835 has four PHASE registers, the resolution of these \nregisters being 2 π/4096. \nCOS LOOKUP TABLE (LUT) \nTo make the output useful, the signal must be converted from \nphase information into a sinusoidal value. Since phase information maps directly into amplitude, a ROM LUT converts the phase \ninformation into amplitude. To do this, the digital phase infor-mation is used to address a COS ROM LUT. Although the NCO contains a 32-bit phase accumulator, the output of the NCO is truncated to 12 bits. Using the full resolution of the phase accu-mulator is impractical and unnecessary as this would require a lookup table of 2\n32 entries. \nIt is necessary only to have sufficient phase resolution in the LUTs such that the dc error of the output waveform is dominated by the quantization error in the DAC. This requires the lookup table to have two more bits of phase resolution than the  \n10-bit DAC. \nDIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER \nThe AD9835 includes a high impedance current source 10-bit \nDAC, capable of driving a wide range of loads at different speeds. \nFull-scale output current can be adjusted, for optimum power \nand external load requirements, through the use of a single \nexternal resistor (R SET). \nThe DAC is configured for single-ended operation. The load \nresistor can be any value required, as long as the full-scale voltage developed across it does not exceed the voltage compliance range. Since full-scale current is controlled by R\nSET, adjustments \nto R SET can balance changes made to the load resistor. However, \nif the DAC full-scale output current is significantly less than 4 mA, \nthe DAC’s linearity may degrade. \n \n Data Sheet AD9835\n \nRev. A | Page 15 of 28 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nSERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD9835 has a serial interface, with 16 bits loaded during \neach write cycle. SCLK, SDATA, and FSYNC are used to load \nthe word into the AD9835.  \nWhen FSYNC is taken low, the AD9835 is informed that a word \nis being written to the device. The first bit is read into the device \non the next SCLK falling edge with the remaining bits being read into the device on the subsequent SCLK falling edges. FSYNC frames the 16 bits; therefore, when 16 SCLK falling edges have occurred, FSYNC should be taken high again. The SCLK can be continuous, or alternatively, the SCLK can idle high or low between write operations. When writing to a frequency/phase register, the first four bits identify whether a frequency or phase register  \nis being written to, the next four bits contain the address of the \ndestination register, while the 8 LSBs contain the data.  \nTable 5  shows the data structure for a 16-bit write to the \nAD9835.

There are two modes for \nloading a register, direct data transfer and a deferred data transfer. With a deferred data transfer, the 8-bit word is loaded into the defer register (8 LSBs or 8 MSBs). However, this data is not \nloaded into the 16-bit data register; therefore, the destination \nregister is not updated. With a direct data transfer, the 8-bit word  \nis loaded into the appropriate defer register (8 LSBs or 8 MSBs). \nImmediately following the loading of the defer register, the \ncontents of the complete defer register are loaded into the 16-bit data register and the destination register is loaded on the next MCLK rising edge. When a destination register is addressed, a \ndeferred transfer is needed first followed by a direct transfer. \nWhen all 16 bits of the defer register contain relevant data, the destination register can then be updated using 8-bit loading rather than 16-bit loading, that is, direct data transfers can  \nbe used.  For example, after a new 16-bit word has been loaded to  \na destination register, the defer register will also contain this word. If the next write instruction is to the same destination \nregister, the user can use direct data transfers immediately. \nWhen writing to a phase register, the 4 MSBs of the 16-bit word \nloaded into the data register should be zero (the phase registers are 12 bits wide). \nTo alter the entire contents of a frequency register, four write \noperations are needed. However, the 16 MSBs of a frequency \nword are contained in a separate register to the 16 LSBs. Therefore, the 16 MSBs of the frequency word can be altered \nindependent of the 16 LSBs. \nThe phase and frequency registers to be used are selected using \nthe FSELECT, PSEL0, and PSEL1 pins, or the corresponding bits can be used. Bit SELSRC determines whether the bits or the \npins are used. When SELSRC = 0, the pins are used, and when \nSELSRC = 1, the bits are used. When CLR is taken high, SELSRC is set to 0 so that the pins are the default source. Data transfers from the serial (defer) register to the 16-bit data register, and the FSELECT and PSEL registers, occur following the 16th falling SCLK edge.  \nTable 11. Controlling the AD9835 \nD15 D14 Command  \n1  0  Selects source of control for the PHASEx and \nFREQx registers and enables synchronization.  \nBit D13 is the SYNC bit. When this bit is high, reading of the FSELECT, PSEL0, and PSEL1 bits/ \npins and the loading of the destination register \nwith data is synchronized with the rising edge of MCLK. The latency is increased by 2 MCLK cycles \nwhen SYNC = 1. When SYNC = 0, the loading of the \ndata and the sampling of FSELECT/PSEL0/PSEL1 occurs asynchronously.  \n  Bit D12 is the select source bit (SELSRC). When this \nbit equals 1, the PHASEx/FREQx REG is selected \nusing the FSELECT, PSEL0, and PSEL1 bits. When SELSRC = 0, the PHASEx/FREQx REG is selected \nusing the FSELECT, PSEL0, and PSEL1 pins. \n1  1  SLEEP , RESET, and CLR (clear). \n  D13 is the SLEEP bit. When this bit equals 1, the AD9835 is powered down, internal clocks are \ndisabled, and the current sources and REFOUT of the DAC are turned off. When SLEEP = 0, the \nAD9835  is powered up. When RESET (D12) = 1, the \nphase accumulator is set to zero phase that \ncorresponds to an analog output of midscale. \nWhen CLR (D11) = 1, SYNC and SELSRC are set to \nzero. CLR resets to 0 automatically.  \n \n Data Sheet AD9835\n \nRev. A | Page 17 of 28 Table 12.

Because SCLK and MCLK are asynchronous, an MCLK rising \nedge may occur while the data bits are in a transitional state. \nThis can cause a brief spurious DAC output if the register being written to is generating the DAC output. To avoid such spurious \noutputs, the AD9835 contains synchronizing circuitry.  \nWhen the SYNC bit is set to 1, the synchronizer is enabled and \ndata transfers from the serial register (defer register) to the 16-bit data register, and the FSELECT/PSEL registers occur following \na two-stage pipeline delay that is triggered on the MCLK falling \nedge. The pipeline delay ensures that the data is valid when the transfer occurs. Similarly, selection of the frequency/phase registers using the FSELECT/PSELx pins is synchronized with the MCLK rising edge when SYNC = 1. When SYNC = 0, the \nsynchronizer is bypassed. \nSelecting the frequency/phase registers using the pins is \nsynchronized with MCLK intern ally also when SYNC = 1 to \nensure that these inputs are valid at the MCLK rising edge. If \ntimes t\n11 and t 11A are met, then the inputs will be at steady state \nat the MCLK rising edge. However, if times t 11 and t 11A are \nviolated, the internal synchronizing circuitry will delay the instant at which the pins are sampled, ensuring that the inputs are valid at the sampling instant (see Figure 5 ). \nLATENCY \nAssociated with each operation is a latency. When inputs \nFSELECT/PSEL change value, there is a pipeline delay before \ncontrol is transferred to the selected register; there is a pipeline delay before the analog output is controlled by the selected register. When times t\n11 and t 11A are met, PSEL0, PSEL1, and \nFSELECT have latencies of six MCLK cycles when SYNC = 0. \nWhen SYNC = 1, the latency is increased to 8 MCLK cycles. \nWhen times t 11 and t 11A are not met, the latency can increase by \none MCLK cycle. Similarly, there is a latency associated with each write operation. If a selected frequency/phase register is loaded with a new word, there is a delay of 6 to 7 MCLK cycles before the analog output will change (there is an uncertainty of one MCLK cycle regarding the MCLK rising edge at which the \ndata is loaded into the destination register). When SYNC = 1, \nthe latency is 8 or 9 MCLK cycles. \nFLOWCHARTS \nThe flowchart in Figure 22  shows the operating routine for the \nAD9835. When the AD9835 is powered up, the part should be \nreset, which resets the phase accumulator to zero so that the analog output is at midscale. To avoid spurious DAC outputs while the AD9835 is being initialized, the RESET bit should be set to 1 until the part is ready to begin generating an output. \nTaking CLR high sets SYNC and SELSRC to 0 so that the \nFSELECT/PSELx pins are used to select the frequency/phase registers, and the synchronization circuitry is bypassed. A write operation is needed to the SYNC/SELSRC register to enable the synchronization circuitry or to change control to the FSELECT/ PSEL bits.  \nRESET does not reset the phase and frequency registers. These \nregisters will contain invalid data and, therefore, should be set to \na known value by the user. The RESET bit is then set to 0 to begin generating an output. A signal will appear at the DAC output 6 \nMCLK cycles after RESET is set to 0. \nThe analog output is f\nMCLK/232 × FREG, where FREG is the value \nloaded into the selected frequency register. This signal is phase \nshifted by the amount specified in the selected phase register \n(2π/4096 × PHASEx REG, where PHASEx REG is the value \ncontained in the selected phase register). \nControl of the frequency/phase registers can be interchanged \nfrom the pins to the bits. \n  \n \nAD9835  Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Selecting Data Sources \n \n \nAD9835  Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 20 of 28 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe AD9835 contains functions that make it suitable for \nmodulation applications. The part can be used to perform \nsimple modulation such as FSK. More complex modulation schemes such as GMSK and QPSK can also be implemented \nusing the AD9835 . In an FSK application, the two frequency \nregisters of the AD9835 are loaded with different values; one \nfrequency will represent the space frequency while the other \nwill represent the mark frequency. The digital data stream is fed to the FSELECT pin, which will cause the AD9835 to modulate \nthe carrier frequency between the two values. \nThe AD9835 has four phase registers; this enables the part to \nperform PSK. With phase shift keying, the carrier frequency is \nphase shifted, the phase being altered by an amount that is related to the bit stream being input to the modulator. The presence of four shift registers eases the interaction needed \nbetween the DSP and the AD9835. \nThe AD9835 is also suitable for signal generator applications. \nWith its low current consumption, the part is suitable for \napplications in which it can be used as a local oscillator. \nGROUNDING AND LAYOUT \nThe printed circuit board that houses the AD9835  should be \ndesigned so that the analog and digital sections are separated and confined to certain areas of the board. This facilitates the use of ground planes which can be separated easily. A minimum etch technique is generally best for ground planes as it gives the best shielding. Digital and analog ground planes should only be joined in one place. If the AD9835  is the only device requiring \nan AGND to DGND connection, then the ground planes should be connected at the AGND and DGND pins of the AD9835. If the AD9835 is in a system where multiple devices \nrequire AGND to DGND connections, the connection should be made at one point only, a star ground point that should be established as close as possible to the AD9835. \nAvoid running digital lines under the device as these will couple \nnoise onto the die. The analog ground plane should be allowed \nto run under the AD9835 to avoid noise coupling. The power supply lines to the AD9835 should use as large a track as is \npossible to provide low impedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals such \nas clocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid \nradiating noise to other sections of the board. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board should run at right angles to each other. This will reduce the effects of feedthrough through the board. A microstrip \ntechnique is by far the best but is not always possible with a \ndouble-sided board. In this technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to ground planes while signals are placed \non the other side. Good decoupling is important. The analog and digital supplies \nto the AD9835 are independent and separately pinned out to \nminimize coupling between analog and digital sections of the device. All analog and digital supplies should be decoupled to \nAGND and DGND respectively with 0.1 mF ceramic capacitors \nin parallel with 10 mF tantalum capacitors. To achieve the best from the decoupling capacitors, they should be placed as close as possible to the device, ideally right up against the device. In systems where a common supply is used to drive both the \nAVDD and DVDD of the AD9835, it is recommended that the \nsystem’s AVDD supply be used. This supply should have the \nrecommended analog supply decoupling between the AVDD pins of the AD9835 and AGND and the recommended digital \nsupply decoupling capacitors between the DVDD pins and DGND. \nINTERFACING THE AD9835 TO \nMICROPROCESSORS \nThe AD9835 has a standard serial interface that allows the part \nto interface directly with several microprocessors. The device \nuses an external serial clock to write the data/control information into the device. The serial clock can have a frequency of 20 MHz maximum. The serial clock can be continuous or it can idle high or low between write operations. When data/ control information is being written to the AD9835, FSYNC is taken \nlow and held low while the 16 bits of data are being written into the AD9835. The FSYNC signal frames the 16 bits of information \nbeing loaded into the AD9835. \nAD9835-TO-ADSP-21XX INTERFACE \nFigure 26  shows the serial interface between the AD9835 and \nthe ADSP-21xx. The ADSP-21xx should be set up to operate in the SPORT Transmit Alternate Framing Mode (TFSW = 1). The ADSP-21xx is programmed through the SPORT control register \nand should be configured as follows: Internal clock operation \n(ISCLK = 1), Active low framing (INVTFS = 1), 16-bit word length (SLEN = 15), Internal frame sync signal (ITFS = 1), Generate a frame sync for each write operation (TFSR = 1). Transmission is initiated by writing a word to the Tx register \nafter the SPORT has been enabled. The data is clocked out on \neach rising edge of the serial clock and clocked into the AD9835  \non the SCLK falling edge. \nAD9835*\nFSYNC\nSDATA\nSCLKADSP-2101/\nADSP-2103*\nTFS\nDT\nSCLK\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.\n09630-028 \nFigure 26.

The microcontroller is \nconfigured as the master by setting bit MSTR in the SPCR to 1 and, this provides a serial clock on SCK while the MOSI output \ndrives the serial data line SDATA. Since the microcontroller \ndoes not have a dedicated frame sync pin, the FSYNC signal is derived from a port line (PC7). The setup conditions for correct operation of the interface are as follows: the SCK idles high between write operations (CPOL = 0), data is valid on the SCK falling edge (CPHA = 1). When data is being transmitted to the \nAD9835, the FSYNC line is taken low (PC7). Serial data from \nthe 68HC11/68L11 is transmitted in 8-bit bytes with only eight falling clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. Data is transmitted MSB first. In order to load data into the AD9835, PC7 \nis held low after the first eight bits are transferred and a second \nserial write operation is performed to the AD9835. Only after \nthe second eight bits have been transferred should FSYNC be \ntaken high again. \nAD9835*\nFSYNC\nSDATA\nSCLK68HC11/68L11*\nPC7\nMOSI\nSCK\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.\n09630-029 \nFigure 27. 68HC11/68L11-to- AD9835  Interface \nAD9835-TO-80C51/80L51 INTERFACE \nFigure 26  shows the serial interface between the AD9835 and \nthe 80C51/80L51 microcontroller. The microcontroller is \noperated in Mode 0 so that TXD of the 80C51/80L51 drives SCLK of the AD9835 while RXD drives the serial data line \nSDATA. The FSYNC signal is again derived from a bit programmable pin on the port (P3.3 being used in the \ndiagram). When data is to be transmitted to the AAD9835,  \nP3.3 is taken low. The 80C51/80L51 transmits data in 8-bit \nbytes thus, only eight falling SCLK edges occur in each cycle.  To load the remaining eight bits to the AD9835, P3.3 is held  \nlow after the first eight bits have been transmitted and a second \nwrite operation is initiated to transmit the second byte of data. P3.3 is taken high following the completion of the second write \noperation. SCLK should idle high between the two write \noperations. The 80C51/ 80L51 outputs the serial data in a format which has the LSB first. The AD9835 accepts the MSB first (the 4 MSBs being the control information, the next 4 bits being the address while the 8 LSBs contain the data when \nwriting to a destination register). Therefore, the transmit \nroutine of the 80C51/80L51 must take this into account and \nrearrange the bits so that the MSB is output first. \nAD9835*\nFSYNC\nSDATA\nSCLK80C51/80L51*\nP3.3\nRxD\nTxD\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.\n09630-030 \nFigure 28. 80C51/80L51 to AD9835 Interface \nAD9835-TO-DSP56002 INTERFACE \nFigure 29  shows the interface between the AD9835 and the \nDSP56002.
