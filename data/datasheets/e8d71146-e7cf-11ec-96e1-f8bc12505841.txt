It integrates a \nhigh-side, high-voltage , power MOSFET with a \ncurrent limit of 3.5A, typical ly. The wide 4.5V to \n100V input range accommodates a variety of \nstep-down applications, making it ideal for \nautomotive, industry , and lighting applications. \nHysteretic voltage -mode control is employed for \nvery fast response. MPS’s proprietary feedback \ncontrol scheme minimizes the  number of \nrequired external components.  \nThe switching frequency can be up to 1MHz, \nallowing for small component size. Thermal \nshutdown and short -circuit protection (SCP) \nprovide reliable and fault -tolerant operations. A \n170µ A quiescent current allows the MP9486A  \nto be used in battery -powered applications.  \nThe MP9486A  is available in a SOIC -8 package  \nwith an exposed pad.

All Rights Reserved.  \nOPERATION  \nHysteresis  Current Control with Adaptive \nThreshold Adjustment  \nThe MP9486A  operates in a  hystere tic voltage -\ncontrol mode to regulate the output voltage.  FB \nis connected to the tap of a resistor divider , \nwhich determines the output voltage . The \npower MOSFET is  turned on when the FB \nvoltage ( VFB) drops to 185mV and remains on \nuntil VFB rises to 215mV. The power MOSFET is \nturned o ff when V FB rises to 215mV and \nremains o ff until VFB falls to  185mV. The two \nthresholds of 215mV and 185mV are adjusted \nadaptively to compensate for all the circuit \ndelays , so the output voltage  is regulated with \nan aver age 200mV value at FB . \nEnable (EN) Control  \nThe MP9486A  has a dedicated enable control \npin (EN)  with positive logic . Its falling threshold \nis 1.2 3V, and its rising threshold is 1.5 5V \n(320mV higher).  \nWhen floating, EN is pulled up to about 3V by \nan int ernal 2µA current source , so it is enabled. \nA current over 2 µ A is needed to pull EN down.  \nFloating Driver and Bootstrap Charging  \nThe floating power MOSFET driver is powered \nby an external bootstrap capacitor. This floating \ndriver has its own under -voltage lockout ( UVLO ) \nprotection. The UVLO rising threshold is 2.2V \nwith a threshold of 150mV.  \nThe bootstrap capacitor is charged and \nregulated to about 5V by the dedicated internal \nbootstrap regulator.  \nIf the internal circuit does not have sufficient \nvoltage , and the bootstrap capacitor is not \nsufficiently charged, extra external circuitry can \nbe used to ensure that the bootstrap voltage is \nin the normal operati ng region. Refer to the \nExternal Bootstrap Diode  section on page 1 4 \nfor more details . Under -Voltage Lo ckout (UVLO)  \nUnder -voltage lockout (UVLO) is implemented \nto protect the chip from operating at an \ninsufficient supply voltage. The UVLO rising \nthreshold is about 4V, while its falling threshold \nis a consist ent 3.6V. \nDimming  Function for LED Application s \nBecause the FB reference of the MP9486A  is \nvery low, it is recommended to use the \nMP9486A  for LED driver s by connecting the \nLED current sense resistor between FB and \nGND. In such applications,  the MP9486A  uses \nDIM for dimming. To achieve dimming , apply a \npulse on DIM. The high level of the pulse \nshould be >1.5V, and the low level should  be \n<0.5V . The frequency can be as high as 20kHz.  \nThermal Shutdown  \nThermal shutdown is implemented to prevent \nthe chip from operating at exceedingly high \ntemp eratures. When the silicon die temperature \nis higher than its upper threshold, the entire \nchip shuts down . When the temperature is \nlower than its lower threshold, the chip is \nenabled again.  \nOutput  Short Protection  \nThe output voltage is well -regulated when VFB is \naround 200mV. If the output is pulled low in \nover-current protection ( OCP ) or is shorted to \nGND directly, VFB is low , even though the power \nMOSFET is turned on . The MP9486A  regard s \nthe low VFB as a failure.  The power MOSFET \nshuts off if the failure time is longer than 10µs. \nThe MP9486A  attempts operation again after a \ndelay  of about 300µs.  \nThe power MOSFET current is also accurately \nsensed via a current sense MOSFET. If the \ncurrent is over the current limit , the IC is shut \ndown. This off ers extra protection under output -\nshort conditions.  \n \n  \nMP9486A  – 100V INPUT, 1A, STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \nMP9486A  Rev. 1.0 www.MonolithicPower.com  13 \n6/30/2017  MPS Proprietary Inf ormation.

All Rights Reserved.  \nAPPLICATION INFORMAT ION \nSetting the Output Voltage  \nThe output voltage  (VOUT) is set by a resistor  \ndivider  (R1 and R2 ) (see the Typical Application \non page 1). To achieve good noise immunity \nand low  power loss, R2 is recommended to be \nin the range of 5kΩ to  50kΩ. R1 can then be \ndetermined with Equation (1) : \n \nOUT FB\nFBVVR1 R2V\uf02d\uf03d\uf0b4  (1) \nWhere V FB is 0.2V, typically .  \nOutput Capacitor  and Frequency Setting  \nThe output capacitor (C OUT) is necessary for \nachiev ing a smooth output voltage. The ESR  of \nthe capacitor should be sufficiently large  \ncompared to the capacitance; otherwise,  the \nsystem may behave in an unexpected  way, and \nthe current ripple may be very  high. V FB \nchanges from 185mV to 215mV  when the \npower MOSFET switches  on. To charge the \ncapacitor and generate  215mV at FB, the \nsystem needs ESR and  some inductor current. \nFor example, for a  5V V OUT, if the forward \ncapacitor is 0.1 µF, the suggested ESR range of \nthe output  capacitor is 100m Ω to 250m Ω. \nTantalum or  aluminum electrolytic capacitors \nwith a  small ceramic capacitor are \nrecommended.   \nA forward capacitor across R1 is  recommended \nwhen the output capacitor is  tantalum or \naluminum electrolytic, which  can set the desired  \nfrequency if th e output  capacitor and ESR \ncannot be changed. The  forward capacitor can \nreduce the output  voltage ripple.  \nIn some application,  simply a forward capacitor \nmay not get proper frequency, then we can add \na forward resistor in series with the forward \ncapacitor or even more add a ceramic on the \noutput.  \nSelecting the Inductor   \nThe inductor (L) is required to  convert the \nswitching voltage to a smooth current to the \nload. Although the output current is  low, it is \nrecommended that the inductor current be \ncontinuous in each switching period to prevent \nreaching the current limit. Calculate the inductor \nvalue with Equation (2):   \nIN OUT OUT\nSW OUT INV V VLF I V K\uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4（ ）  (2) \nWhere K is a coefficient of about 0.15 ~ 0.85 . \nOutput Rectifier Diode  \nThe output rectifier diode supplies current to the \ninductor when the high -side switch is  off. To \nreduce losses due to the diode forward voltage \nand recovery times, use a Schottky diode.  \nThe average  current through the diode can be \napproximated with Equation (3) : \n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf02d\uf03d\nINOUT\nOUT DVV1xII  (3) \nChoose a diode with a maximum reverse \nvoltage rating greater than the maximum input \nvoltage and a current rating is greater than the \naverage  diode current .  \nInput Capacitor  (CIN) \nThe input current t o the step -down converter is \ndiscontinuous  and therefore requires a \ncapacitor to supply AC current to the step -down \nconverter while maintaining the DC input \nvoltage. Use low ESR capacitors for the best \nperformance , especially under high switching \nfrequency  applications . \nThe RMS current through the  input capacitor  \ncan be calculated with Equation  (4): \n \nOUT OUT\nIN_ AC OUT\nIN INVVI I x x(1 )VV\uf03d\uf02d  (4) \nWith low ESR capacitors , the input voltage \nripple can be estimated with Equation (5): \n \nOUT OUT OUT\nIN\nSW IN IN INI V VV (1 )F C V V\uf0b4\uf044 \uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4  (5) \nChoose an input capacitor with enough RMS \ncurrent rating and enough capacitance for small \ninput voltage ripple s.  \nWhen electrolytic or tantalum capacitors  are \napplied , a small, high -quality ceramic capacitor \n(i.e.: 0.1μF ) should be placed as close to the IC \nas possible.  \nMP9486A  – 100V INPUT, 3.5A, SWITCHING CURRENT LI MIT STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMP9486A  Rev. 1.1 www.Monolithic Power.com  14 \n6/30/2017  MPS Proprietary Information.
