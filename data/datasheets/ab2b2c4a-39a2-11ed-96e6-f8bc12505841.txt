The pMOS output stage canbe driven from input voltages down to 1.425V withoutsacrificing stability or transient performance. Supplycurrent is not a significant function of load or input head-room because this regulator has a pMOS output device.\nThe MAX8556/MAX8557 are fully protected from an out-\nput short circuit by current-limiting and thermal-overloadcircuitry. The low-power shutdown mode reduces sup-ply current to 0.2µA (typ) to maximize battery life inportable applications. The MAX8556 includes an open-drain power-OK signal (POK) that goes high when theregulator output is within ±10% of its nominal outputvoltage. The MAX8557 includes an open-drain power-on-reset output (POR) that goes high 140ms after theoutput has risen above 90% of its nominal value.\nInternal p-Channel Pass Transistor\nThe MAX8556/MAX8557 feature a 25m Ωp-channel\nMOSFET pass transistor. Unlike similar designs usingpnp pass transistors, p-channel MOSFETs require nobase drive, which reduces quiescent current; pnp-based regulators also waste considerable current indropout when the pass transistor saturates, and usehigh base-drive currents under large loads. TheMAX8556/MAX8557 do not suffer from these problemsand consume only 800µA (typ) of quiescent currentunder heavy loads, as well as in dropout.\nShort-Circuit/Thermal Fault Protection\nThe MAX8556/MAX8557 are fully protected from outputshort circuits through current-limiting and thermal-over-load circuitry. When the output is shorted to ground, theoutput current is foldback limited to 3A (max). Underthese conditions, the device quickly heats up. Whenthe junction temperature reaches +160°C, the thermal-overload circuitry turns off the output, allowing thedevice to cool. When the junction cools to +115°C, theoutput turns back on and attempts to establish regula-tion. Current limiting and thermal protection continueuntil the fault is removed.Shutdown Mode\nThe MAX8556/MAX8557 feature a low-power shutdownmode that reduces quiescent current to 0.2µA (typ).Drive EN low to disable the voltage reference, erroramplifier, gate-drive circuitry, and pass transistor, andpull the output low with 5k Ωimpedance. Drive EN high\nor connect to IN for normal operation.\nPower-OK Output (POK, MAX8556 Only)\nThe MAX8556 features a power-OK (POK) output toindicate the status of the output. POK is high impedancewhen the regulator output is within ±10% of its nominaloutput voltage. If the output voltage falls/rises outsidethis range or the IC experiences thermal fault, POK isinternally pulled low. This open-drain output requires anexternal pullup resistor to V\nINor another logic supply\nbelow 3.6V. For glitch immunity, an internal delay circuitprevents the output from switching for 50µs (typ) afterthe trip threshold is initially reached. POK is low whenthe IC is in shutdown mode.\nPower-On Reset (POR, MAX8557 Only)\nThe MAX8557 features a power-on reset output thatgoes high impedance 140ms (typ) after the outputreaches 90% of its nominal value. This open-drain out-put requires an external pullup resistor to V\nINor another\nlogic supply less than 3.6V. When the output falls below90% of the nominal output voltage or the IC experi-ences a thermal fault, POR immediately transitions low.POR is low when the IC is in shutdown mode.\nOperating Region and Power Dissipation\nThe maximum power dissipation depends on the ther-mal resistance of the IC package and the circuit board,the temperature difference between the die junction andambient air, and the rate of ambient airflow. The powerdissipated by the IC is P = I\nOUT x (VIN- VOUT). Proper\nPCB layout can increase the allowed power dissipationby dissipating heat in the board instead of the package.See the \nThermal Considerations in PCB Layout section\nfor more details.\nMAX8556/MAX85574A Ultra-Low-Input-Voltage\nLDO Regulators\n8 _______________________________________________________________________________________Applications Information\nOutput Voltage Selection\nThe MAX8556/MAX8557 feature an adjustable output\nvoltage from 0.5V to 3.4V. Set the output voltage usingan external resistor-divider from the output to GND withFB connected to the center tap as shown in Figures 1and 2. Choose R3 ≤1kΩfor light-load stability.\nDetermine R2 using the following equation:\nwhere V\nOUTis the desired output voltage and V FB is 0.5V.\nCapacitor Selection and\nRegulator Stability\nCapacitors are required at the MAX8556/MAX8557\ninputs and outputs for stable operation over the fulltemperature range and with load currents up to 4A.Connect 2 x 10µF capacitors between IN and GND and2 x 10µF low equivalent-series-resistance (ESR) capac-itors between OUT and GND. The input capacitor (C\nIN)\nlowers the source impedance of the input supply. If theMAX8556/MAX8557s’ input is close to the output of thesource supply, a smaller input capacitance can beused. Otherwise, 2 x 10µF ceramic input capacitors arerecommended. The output capacitor’s (C\nOUT) ESR\naffects output noise and may affect output stability. Useoutput capacitors with an ESR of 0.05 Ωor less to\nensure stability and optimum transient dropout. Forgood output transient performance, use the followingformula to select a minimum output capacitance:\nC\nOUT= IOUT(MAX) x 1µF/200mA\nNoise, PSRR, and Transient Response\nThe MAX8556/MAX8557 are designed to operate with\nlow-dropout voltages and low quiescent currents whilestill maintaining low noise, good transient response,and high AC rejection (see the \nTypical Operating\nCharacteristics for a plot of Power-Supply Rejection\nRatio (PSRR) vs. Frequency). When operating fromnoisy sources, improved supply-noise rejection andtransient response can be achieved by increasing thevalues of the input and output bypass capacitors andthrough passive filtering techniques. The MAX8556/MAX8557 load-transient response graphs (see theTypical Operating Characteristics ) show two compo-\nnents of the output response: a DC shift from the outputimpedance due to the load current change, and thetransient response. A typical transient overshoot for astep change in the load current from 40mA to 4A is40mV. Use an output capacitance from 20µF to 120µFto attenuate the overshoot.RR xV\nVOUT\nFB23 1     =−⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nIN7–11\n13\n14\n15POR POR\nGNDSHUTDOWNOUT\nFB1–6\n12R1\n100kΩR2\n2kΩ\nR3\n1kΩC1\n2 x 10µFC2\n2 x 10µF\n18\nN.C.U2\nENENABLEDVIN\n1.7V TO 3.6VVOUT\n1.5V AT 4A\nMAX8557\nFigure 2.

Using the JEDEC teststandard, the maximum power dissipation allowed inthe package is 2667mW. This data is obtained with+70°C ambient temperature and +150°C maximumjunction temperature. The test board has dimensions of3in x 3in with four layers of 2oz copper and FR-4 mater-ial with 62mil finished thickness. Nine thermal vias areused under the thermal paddle with a diameter of 12miland 1mil plated copper thickness. Top and bottom lay-ers are used to route the traces. Two middle layers aresolid copper and isolated from the nine thermal vias.\nMore power dissipation can be handled by the pack-\nage if great attention is given during PCB layout. Forexample, using the top and bottom copper as aheatsink and connecting the thermal vias to one of themiddle layers (GND) transfers the heat from the pack-age into the board more efficiently, resulting in lowerjunction temperature at high power dissipation in someMAX8556/MAX8557 applications. Furthermore, the sol-der mask around the IC area on both top and bottomlayers can be removed to radiate the heat directly intothe air. The maximum allowable power dissipation inthe IC is as follows:where T\nJ(MAX) is the maximum junction temperature\n(+150°C), T Ais the ambient air temperature, θJC\n(1.7°C/W for the 16-pin TQFN) is the thermal resistance\nfrom the junction to the case, and θCAis the thermal\nresistance from the case to the surrounding air throughthe PCB, copper traces, and the package materials.θ\nCAis directly related to system level variables and can\nbe modified to increase the maximum power dissipa-tion. The TQFN package has an exposed thermal padon its underside. This pad provides a low thermal resis-tance path for heat transfer into the PCB. This low ther-mally resistive path carries a majority of the heat awayfrom the IC. The PCB is effectively a heatsink for the IC.\nThe exposed paddle should be connected to a large\nground plane for proper thermal and electrical perfor-mance. The minimum size of the ground plane isdependent upon many system variables. To create anefficient path, the exposed paddle should be solderedto a thermal landing, which is connected to the groundplane by thermal vias. The thermal landing should be atleast as large as the exposed paddle and can be madelarger depending on the amount of free space from theexposed paddle to the other pin landings.\nA sample layout is available on the MAX8556 evalua-\ntion kit to speed designs.\nPTT\nMAXJ MAX A\nJC CA  ( () )=−\n+θθ\nPACKAGE TYPE PACKAGE CODE DOCUMENT NO.\n16 TQFN-EP T1655+2 21-0140Chip Information\nTRANSISTOR COUNT: 3137\nPROCESS: BiCMOSPackage Information\nFor the latest package outline information and land patterns, go\nto www.maxim-ic.com/packages .
