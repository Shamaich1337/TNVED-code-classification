D | Page 3 of 44 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD9265 is a 16-bit, 125 MSPS analog-to-digital converter \n(ADC). The AD9265 is designed to support communications \napplications where high perfor mance combined with low cost, \nsmall size, and versatility is desired. \nThe ADC core features a multistage, differential pipelined \narchitecture with integrated ou tput error correction logic to \nprovide 16-bit accuracy at 125 MSPS data rates and guarantees no missing codes over the full operating temperature range. \nThe ADC features a wide bandwidth differential sample-and-hold analog input amplifier suppor ting a variety of user-selectable \ninput ranges. It is suitable for multiplexed systems that switch full-scale voltage levels in successive channels and for sampling single-channel inputs at frequenc ies well beyond the Nyquist rate. \nCombined with power and cost savings over previously available ADCs, the AD9265 is suitable for applications in communications, instrumentation and medical imaging. A differential clock input controls all internal conversion cycles. A \nduty cycle stabilizer provides th e means to compensate for vari-\nations in the ADC clock duty cycle, allowing the converters to maintain excellent performance over a wide range of input clock \nduty cycles. An integrated voltage reference eases design consid-\nerations. \nThe ADC output data format is either parallel 1.8 V CMOS or \nLVDS (DDR). A data output clock is provided to ensure proper latch timing with receiving logic. \nProgramming for setup and control is accomplished using a 3-wire \nSPI-compatible serial interface.  Flexible power-down options \nallow significant power savings, when desired. An optional on-chip dither function is available to improve SFDR performance \nwith low power analog input signals. \nThe AD9265 is available in a Pb-free, 48-lead LFCSP and is speci-\nfied over the industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C. \n \n \nAD9265 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Soldering the exposed paddle to the customer \nboard increases the reliability of the solder joints and maximizes \nthe thermal capability of the package. \nTypical θ JA is specified for a 4-layer PCB with a solid ground \nplane. As shown, airflow improves heat dissipation, which \nreduces θ JA. In addition, metal in direct contact with the package \nleads from metal traces, through holes, ground, and power planes, \nreduces the θ JA. \nTable 7.

D | Page 25 of 44 THEORY OF OPERATION \nWith the AD9265, the user can sample any f S/2 frequency \nsegment from dc to 200 MHz, using appropriate low-pass or \nband-pass filtering at the ADC inputs with little loss in ADC \nperformance. Operation to 300 MHz analog input is permitted, but it occurs at the expense of increased ADC noise and distortion. \nSynchronization capability is provided to allow synchronized \ntiming between multiple devices. \nProgramming and control of the AD9265 are accomplished \nusing a 3-wire SPI-compat ible serial interface. \nADC ARCHITECTURE \nThe AD9265 architecture consists of a front-end sample-and-\nhold input network, followed by a pipelined, switched-\ncapacitor ADC. The quantized outputs from each stage \ncombine into a final 16-bit result in the digital correction logic. The \npipelined architecture permits the first stage to operate on a new input sample and the remain ing stages to operate on the \npreceding samples. Sampling occurs on the rising edge of the clock. \nEach stage of the pipeline, exclud ing the last, consists of a low \nresolution flash ADC connected to a switched-capacitor digital-\nto-analog converter (DAC) and an interstage residue amplifier \n(MDAC). The residue amplifier magnifies the difference between \nthe reconstructed DAC output and the flash input for the next stage in the pipeline. One bit of redundancy is used in each stage to facilitate digital correction of flash errors. The last stage simply consists of a flash ADC. \nThe input stage can be ac- or dc-coupled in differential or \nsingle-ended modes. The output staging block aligns the data, \ncorrects errors, and passes the da ta to the output buffers. The \noutput buffers are powered from a separate supply, allowing \nadjustment of the output voltage swing. During power-down, the output buffers go into a high impedance state. \nANALOG INPUT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe analog input to the AD9265 is a differential switched-\ncapacitor network that has been designed to give optimum performance while processing a differential input signal.  \nThe clock signal alternatively switches between sample mode \nand hold mode (see Figure 64). When the input is switched into \nsample mode, the signal source must be capable of charging the \nsample capacitors and settling within 1/2 of a clock cycle.  \n  \n \n     A small resistor in series with each input can help reduce the \npeak transient current required from the output stage of the \ndriving source. A shunt capacitor can be placed across the inputs to provide dynamic charging currents. This passive \nnetwork creates a low-pass filter at the ADC input; therefore, \nthe precise values are dependent on the application.  \nIn intermediate frequency (IF) undersampling applications, any \nshunt capacitors should be reduced. In combination with the \ndriving source impedance, the shunt capacitors limit the input \nbandwidth. Refer to Application Note AN-742, Frequency Domain \nResponse of Switched-Capacitor ADCs ; Application Note  AN-827,  \nA Resonant Approach to Interfacing Amplifiers to Switched-\nCapacitor ADCs ; and the Analog Dialogue article, “Transformer-\nCoupled Front-End for Wideband A/D Converters,” for more information on this subject. \nCPAR1\nCPAR1CPAR2\nCPAR2SS\nSS\nSSCFB\nCFBCS\nCSBIAS\nBIASVIN+\nH\nVIN–\n08502-037 \nFigure 64. Switched Capacitor Input \nFor best dynamic performance, the source impedances driving \nVIN+ and VIN− should be matched, and the inputs should be \ndifferentially balanced. \nAn internal differential refere nce buffer creates positive and \nnegative reference voltages that define the input span of the ADC \ncore. The span of the ADC core is set by this buffer to 2 × VREF . \nInput Common Mode  \nThe analog inputs of the AD9265 are not internally dc biased. \nIn ac-coupled applications, the user must provide this bias \nexternally. Setting the device so that V CM = 0.5 × AVDD is \nrecommended for optimum performance, but the device functions over a wider range with reasonable performance (see \nFigure 52). An on-board common-mode voltage reference is \nincluded in the design and is available from the VCM pin. Optimum performance is achieved when the common-mode voltage of the analog input is set by the VCM pin voltage (typically 0.5 × AVDD). The VC M pin must be decoupled to \nground by a 0.1 μF capacitor, as described in the Applications \nInformation section. \n \n \n  \nAD9265 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 26 of 44 Dither \nThe AD9265 has an optional dither mode that can be selected \neither through the SPI bus or by using the DITHER pin. Dithering \nis the act of injecting a known bu t random amount of white noise, \ncommonly referred to as dither, into the input of the ADC. \nDithering has the effect of improving the local linearity at various points along the ADC transfer function. Dithering  can significantly improve the SFDR when quantizing small \nsignal inputs, typically when the input level is below −6 dBFS. \nAs shown in Figure 65, the dither that is added to the input of \nthe ADC through the dither DAC is precisely subtracted out \ndigitally to minimize SNR degradation. When dithering is enabled, the dither DAC is driven by a pseudorandom number generator (PN gen). In the AD9265, the dither DAC is precisely calibrated \nto result in only a very small degradation in SNR and SINAD. \nThe typical SNR and SINAD degradation values, with dithering \nenabled, are only 1 dB and 0.8 dB, respectively.  \nADC CORE\nDITHER\nDAC\nPN GEN DITHER ENABLEVIN DOUT\n08502-038 \nFigure 65. Dither Block Diagram \nLarge Signal FFT \nIn most cases, dithering does no t improve SFDR for large signal \ninputs close to full scale, for example, with a −1 dBFS input. For \nlarge signal inputs, the SFDR is typically limited by front-end sampling distortion, which dithering cannot improve. However, even for such large signal inputs, dithering may be useful for \ncertain applications because it makes the noise floor whiter. \nAs is common in pipeline ADCs, the AD9265 contains small \nDNL errors caused by random component mismatches that \nproduce spurs or tones that ma ke the noise floor somewhat \nrandomly colored part-to-part . Although these tones are \ntypically at very low levels an d do not limit SFDR when the \nADC is quantizing large signal inputs, dithering converts these tones to noise and produces a whiter noise floor. \nSmall Signal FFT  For small signal inputs, the front-end sampling circuit typically \ncontributes very little distortion, and, therefore, the SFDR is likely to be limited by tones caused by DNL errors due to random com-ponent mismatches. Therefore, for small signal inputs (typically, those below −6 dBFS), dithering can significantly \nimprove SFDR by converting thes e DNL tones to white noise.  \n \n  Static Linearity Dithering also removes sharp lo cal discontinuities in the INL \ntransfer function of the ADC and reduces the overall peak-to-\npeak INL. \nIn receiver applications, utilizing dither helps to reduce DNL errors \nthat cause small signal gain errors. Often this issue is overcome by setting the input noise 5 dB to 10 dB above the converter noise. By utilizing dither within the converter to correct the \nDNL errors, the input noise requirement can be reduced. \nDifferential Input Configurations \nOptimum performance is achieved while driving the AD9265 in a \ndifferential input configuration. For baseband applications, the \nAD8138, ADA4937-2 , and ADA4938-2 differential drivers provide \nexcellent performance and a flexible interface to the ADC.  \nThe output common-mode voltage of the ADA4938 is easily set \nwith the VCM pin of the AD9265 (see Figure 66), and the \ndriver can be configured in the filter topology shown to provide \nband limiting of the input signal. \nVIN 76.8Ω\n120Ω0.1µF\n200Ω200Ω\n90ΩAVDD33Ω\n33Ω15Ω\n15Ω5pF15pF\n15pFADCVIN–\nVIN+ VCMADA4938-2\n08502-039 \nFigure 66.

D | Page 27 of 44 At input frequencies in the second Nyquist zone and above, the \nnoise performance of most amplifie rs is not adequate to achieve \nthe true SNR performance of the AD9265. For applications in \nwhich SNR is a key parameter, differential double balun coupling \nis the recommended input configuration (see Figure 68). In this \nconfiguration, the input is ac-coupled and the CML is provided to each input through a 33 Ω resistor. These resistors compensate for losses in the input baluns to provide a 50 Ω impedance to the driver. \nIn the double balun and transformer configurations, the value of \nthe input capacitors and resistors is dependent on the input fre-\nquency and source impedance and may need to be reduced or \nremoved. Table 10 displays recommended values to set the RC network. However, these values are dependent on the input signal and should be used only as a starting guide. Table 10.

D | Page 28 of 44 VOLTAGE REFERENCE \nA stable and accurate voltage reference is built into the AD9265. \nThe input range can be adjusted by varying the reference voltage \napplied to the AD9265, using either the internal reference or an \nexternally applied reference volt age. The input span of the ADC \ntracks reference voltage changes linearly. The various reference \nmodes are summarized in the sections that follow. The Reference Decoupling section describes the best practices PCB layout of \nthe reference. \nInternal Reference Connection \nA comparator within the AD9265 detects the potential at the SENSE pin and configures the refe rence into four possible modes, \nwhich are summarized in Table 11. If SENSE is grounded, the reference amplifier switch is connected to the internal resistor divider (see Figure 70), setting VREF to 1.0 V for a 2.0 V p-p full-scale input. In this mode, with SENSE grounded, the full scale can \nalso be adjusted through the SPI po rt by adjusting Bit 6 and Bit 7 of \nRegister 0x18. These bits can be used to change the full scale to \n1.25 V p-p, 1.5 V p-p, 1.75 V p-p, or to the default of 2.0 V p-p, as shown in Table 17.  \nConnecting the SENSE pin to the VR EF pin switches the reference \namplifier output to the SENSE pin, completing the loop and pro-\nviding a 0.5 V reference output for a 1 V p-p full-scale input. \nVREF\nSENSE\n0.5V\nADCSELECT\nLOGIC0.1µF 1.0µFVIN–VIN+\nADC\nCORE\n08502-043 \nFigure 70.

Equivalent Clock Input Circuit \nClock Input Options \nThe AD9265 has a very flexible clock input structure. Clock input \ncan be a CMOS, LVDS, LVPECL, or sine wave signal. Regardless \nof the type of signal being used, clock source jitter is of the most \nconcern, as described in the Jitter Considerations section. \nFigure 75 and Figure 76 show two preferred methods for clocking \nthe AD9265. A low jitter clock source is converted from a single-\nended signal to a differential signal  using either an RF transformer \nor an RF balun.  The RF balun configuration is recommended for clock frequencies at 625 MHz and the RF transformer is recommended for clock frequencies from 10 MHz to 200 MHz. The back-to-back Schottky diodes across the transformer/balun secondary limit clock excur-\nsions into the AD9265 to approximately 0.8 V p-p differential.  \nThis limit helps prevent the larg e voltage swings of the clock \nfrom feeding through to other portions of the AD9265 while \npreserving the fast rise and fall times of the signal that are critical \nto low jitter performance.  \n0.1µF\n0.1µF0.1µF 0.1µF\nSCHOTTKY\nDIODES:\nHSMS2822CLOCK\nINPUT\n50Ω100Ω\nCLK–CLK+ADC\nAD9265Mini-Circuits ®\nADT1-1WT, 1:1Z\nXFMR\n08502-048 \nFigure 75.

Single-Ended 1.8 V CMOS  Input Clock (Up to 200 MHz)  \nClock Duty Cycle  \nTypical high speed ADCs use both clock edges to generate  \na variety of internal timing signals and, as a result, may be sensitive to clock duty cycle. Commonly, a ±5% tolerance is required on the clock duty cycle to maintain dynamic performance characteristics.  \nThe AD9265 contains a duty cycle stabilizer (DCS) that retimes \nthe nonsampling (falling) edge, providing an internal clock signal \nwith a nominal 50% duty cycle. Th is allows the user to provide a \nwide range of clock input duty cy cles without affecting the perfor-\nmance of the AD9265. Noise and distortion performance are \nnearly flat for a wide range of duty cycles with the DCS enabled. Jitter in the rising edge of the in put is still of paramount concern \nand is not easily reduced by the internal stabilization circuit.  \nThe duty cycle control loop does not function for clock rates \nless than 20 MHz nominally. The loop has a time constant \nassociated with it that must be considered in applications in \nwhich the clock rate can change dynamically. A wait time of  \n1.5 μs to 5 μs is required after a dynamic clock frequency increase or decrease before the DCS loop is relocked to the input signal. During the time period that the loop is not locked, the DCS loop is \nbypassed, and the internal device timing is dependent on the duty \ncycle of the input clock signal. In such applications, it may be appropriate to disable the duty cycle stabilizer. The DCS can also be disabled in some cases when using the input clock divider circuit, see the Input Clock Divider section for additional \ninformation. In all ot her applications, enabling the DCS circuit is \nrecommended to maximize ac performance. \nThe DCS is enabled by setting the SDIO/DCS pin high when \noperating in the external pin mode (see Table 12). If the SPI mode is enabled, the DCS is enabled by default and can be disabled by writing a 0x00 to Address 0x09. \n \n    \n Input Clock Divider \nThe AD9265 contains an input clock divider with the ability to \ndivide the input clock by integer values between 2 and 8. For \nclock divide ratios of 2, 4, 6, or  8, the duty cycle stabilizer (DCS) \nis not required because the output of the divider inherently \nproduces a 50% duty cycle. Enabling the DCS with the clock divider in these divide modes may cause a slight degradation  in SNR; therefore, disabling the DCS is recommended. For \nother divide ratios, divide-by-3, divide-by-5, and divide-by-7, \nthe duty cycle output from the clock divider is related to the input clock’s duty cycle. In these modes, if the input clock has  a 50% duty cycle, the DCS is again not required. However, if a 50% duty cycle input clock is not available, the DCS must be \nenabled for proper part operation.   \nThe AD9265 clock divider can be synchr onized using an external \nsync signal applied to the SYNC pin input. Bit 1 and Bit 2 of Reg-\nister 0x100 allow the clock divider to be resynchronized on every SYNC signal or only on the firs t SYNC signal after the register \nis written. A valid signal at the SYNC pin causes the clock divider to reset to its initial state. This synchronization feature allows \nmultiple parts to have their clock dividers aligned to guarantee \nsimultaneous input sampling. If the SYNC pin is not used, it should be tied to AGND. \nJitter Considerations \nHigh speed, high resolution ADCs are sensitive to the quality  of the clock input. The degradatio n in SNR from the low frequency \nSNR (SNR\nLF) at a given input frequency (f INPUT) due to jitter (t JRMS) \ncan be calculated by \nSNR HF = −10 log[(2π × fINPUT × tJRMS)2 + 10) 10 / (LF SNR\uf02d] \nIn the equation, the rms aperture  jitter represents the clock \ninput jitter specification.

D | Page 31 of 44 Treat the clock input as an analog signal in cases in which \naperture jitter may affect the dynamic range of the AD9265. To \navoid modulating the clock signal with digital noise, separate power supplies for clock drivers from the ADC output driver \nsupplies. Low jitter, crystal cont rolled oscillators make the best \nclock sources. If the clock is gene rated from another type of source \n(by gating, dividing, or another method), the output clock should \nbe retimed by the original clock at the last step. \nRefer to Application Note AN-501, Aperture Uncertainty and \nADC System Performance , and Application Note AN-756, \nSampled Systems and the Effects of Clock Phase Noise and  \nJitter, for more information about jitter performance as it  \nrelates to ADCs. \nPOWER DISSIPATION AND STANDBY MODE \nAs shown in Figure 81, the power dissipated by the AD9265 is \nproportional to its sample rate. In CMOS output mode, the digital \npower dissipation is determined primarily by the strength of the digital drivers and the load on each output bit.  \nThe maximum DRVDD current (IDRVDD) can be \napproximately calculated as \nIDRVDD = VDRVDD × C\nLOAD × fCLK × N \nwhere N is the number of output bits (16 data bits plus 1 DCO, \nin the case of the AD9265).  \nThis maximum current occurs when every output bit switches on every clock cycle, that is, a full-scale square wave at the Nyquist frequency of f\nCLK/2. In practice, the DRVDD current is established \nby the average number of outp ut bits switching, which is \ndetermined by the sample rate and the characteristics of the analog input signal. \nReducing the capacitive load presented to the output drivers \ncan minimize digital power consumption. The data shown in Figure 81, Figure 82, and Figure 83 were taken using a 70 MHz analog input signal with a 5 pF load on each output driver. \n0.5\nTOTAL\nPOWER\nIDRVDDIAVDD\n0.4\n0.30.20.1\n00.200.160.120.080.04\n0\n25 125 75 100 50TOTAL POWER (W)\nSUPPLY CURRENT (A)\nCLOCK FREQUENCY (MSPS)\n08502-179 \nFigure 81.

AD9265 -80 Power and Current vs. Sample Rate \nBy asserting PDWN (either throug h the SPI port or by asserting \nthe PDWN pin high), the AD9265 is placed in power-down mode. \nIn this state, the ADC typically dissipates 0.05 mW. During power-\ndown, the output drivers are placed in a high impedance state. \nAsserting the PDWN pin low returns the AD9265 to its normal \noperating mode.  \nLow power dissipation in power- down mode is achieved by \nshutting down the reference, re ference buffer, biasing networks, \nand clock. Internal capacitors ar e discharged when entering power-\ndown mode and then must be recharged when returning to \nnormal operation.  \nWhen using the SPI port interface, the user can place the ADC \nin power-down mode or standby mode. Standby mode allows the user to keep the internal reference circuitry powered when faster wake-up times are required. In addition, when using the SPI mode, the user can change the function of the external PDWN pin \nto either place the part in power-down or standby mode. See the \nMemory Map Register Descriptio n section for more details.  \n \n \nAD9265 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 32 of 44 DIGITAL OUTPUTS \nThe AD9265 output drivers can be configured to interface with \n1.8 V CMOS logic families. The AD9265 can also be configured \nfor LVDS outputs using a DRVDD supply voltage of 1.8 V. The \nAD9265 defaults to CMOS output mode but can be placed into \nLVDS mode either by setting the LVDS pin high or by using the \nSPI port to place the part into LVDS mode. Because most users do not toggle between CMOS and LVDS mode during operation, use of the LVDS pin is recommended to avoid any power-up loading issues on the CMOS configured outputs. \nIn CMOS output mode, the output drivers are sized to provide \nsufficient output current to drive a wide variety of logic families. However, large drive currents tend to cause current glitches on \nthe supplies, which may affect converter performance. Applications requiring the ADC to drive large capacitive loads or large fanouts may require ex ternal buffers or latches. \nIn LVDS output mode two output  drive levels can be selected, \neither ANSI LVDS or reduced swing LVDS mode. Using the reduced swing LVDS mode lowers the DRVDD current and reduces power consumption. The reduced swing LVDS mode \ncan be selected by asserting th e LVDS_RS pin or by selecting \nthis mode via the SPI port.  \nThe output data format is selected for either offset binary or \ntwos complement by setting the SCLK/DFS pin when operating in the external pin mode (see Table 12).  \nAs detailed in  Application Note AN-877,  Interfacing to High \nSpeed ADCs via SPI , the data format can be selected for offset \nbinary, twos complement, or gray code when using the SPI control. \nTable 12. SCLK/DFS Mode Selection (External Pin Mode) \nVoltage at \nPin SCLK/DFS SDIO/DCS \nAGND Offset binary (de fault) DCS disabled \nSVDD Twos complement DCS enabled (default) Digital Output Enable Function (OEB) \nThe AD9265 has a flexible three-state ability for the digital output \npins. The three-state mode is enabled using the OEB pin or \nthrough the SPI interface. If the OEB pin is low, the output data \ndrivers and DCOs are enabled. If the OEB pin is high, the output data drivers and DCOs are placed in a high impedance state. This OEB function is not intended for rapid access to the data bus. Note that OEB is referenced to the output driver supply (DRVDD) \nand should not exceed that supply voltage. \nWhen using the SPI interface, the data and DCO outputs can be \nthree-stated by using the output enable bar bit in Register 0x14. \nTIMING \nThe AD9265 provides latched data with a pipeline delay of  \n12 clock cycles (12.5 clock cycles in LVDS mode). Data outputs \nare available one propagation delay (t PD) after the rising edge of \nthe clock signal. \nMinimize the length of the output data lines and loads placed \non them to reduce transients within the AD9265 . These \ntransients can degrade converter dynamic performance.  \nThe lowest typical conversion rate of the AD9265  is 10 MSPS. \nAt clock rates below 10 MSPS, dy namic performance can degrade.  \nData Clock Output (DCO) \nThe AD9265 provides a single data clock output (DCO) pin in \nCMOS output mode and two differential data clock output (DCO) \npins in LVDS mode intended for ca pturing the data in an external \nregister. In CMOS output mode, the data outputs are valid on the rising edge of DCO, unless the DCO clock polarity has been \nchanged via the SPI. In LVDS output mode, data is output as \ndouble data rate with the odd nu mbered output bits transitioning \nnear the rising edge of DCO and the even numbered output bits transitioning near the falling edge of DCO. See Figure 2 for a graphical timing description. \nTable 13.

D | Page 33 of 44 BUILT-IN SELF-TEST (BIST) AND OUTPUT TEST \nThe AD9265 includes built-in test features designed to enable \nverification of the integrity of  th e part as well as facilitate board \nlevel debugging. A BIST (built-in self-test) feature is included that \nverifies the integrity of the digital datapath of the AD9265. Various \noutput test options are also provid ed to place predictable values on \nthe outputs of the AD9265.  \nBUILT-IN SELF-TEST (BIST) \nThe BIST is a thorough test of the digital portion of the selected AD9265 signal path. When enabled, th e test runs from an internal \npseudorandom noise (PN) source through the digital datapath starting at the ADC block output. The BIST sequence runs for 512 cycles and stops. The BIST signature value is placed in Register 0x24 and Register 0x25.  The outputs are not disconnected during this test, so the PN sequence can be observed as it runs. The PN sequence can be continued from its last value or reset from the beginning, based \non the value programmed in Register 0x0E, Bit 2. The BIST \nsignature result varies based on the part configuration. \nOUTPUT TEST MODES \nThe output test options are show n in Table 17. When an output \ntest mode is enabled, the analog section of the ADC is discon-\nnected from the digital back end blocks and the test pattern is run through the output formatting block. Some of the test patterns are subject to output formatting, and some are not. The seed value for \nthe PN sequence tests can be forced if the PN reset bits are used to hold the generator in reset mode by setting Bit 4 or Bit 5 of \nRegister 0x0D. These tests can be performed with or without  \nan analog signal (if present, the analog signal is ignored), but they do require an encode cloc k. For more information, see \nApplication Note AN-877,  Interfacing to High Speed ADCs via SPI . \n \n \nAD9265 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 34 of 44 SERIAL PORT INTERFACE (SPI) \nThe AD9265 serial port interface (SPI) allows the user to configure \nthe converter for specific functions or operations through a \nstructured register space provided inside the ADC. The SPI  gives the user added flexibility and customization, depending on \nthe application. Addresses are acce ssed via the serial port and can \nbe written to or read from via the port. Memory is organized into \nbytes that can be further divided into fields, which are documented in the Memory Map section. For detailed operational \ninformation, see Application Note AN-877,  Interfacing to High \nSpeed ADCs via SPI . \nCONFIGURATION USING THE SPI \nThree pins define the SPI of this ADC: the SCLK/DFS pin, the \nSDIO/DCS pin, and the CSB pin (see Table 14). The SCLK/DFS (a serial clock) is used to sy nchronize the read and write data \npresented from and to the ADC. The SDIO/DCS (serial data input/output) is a dual-purpose pi n that allows data to be sent \nand read from the internal ADC memory map registers. The CSB (chip select bar) is an active low control that enables or disables the read and write cycles. \nTable 14. Serial Port Interface Pins \nPin Mnemonic Function \nSCLK/DFS Serial clock. The SCLK function of the pin is for \nthe serial shift clock in put, which is used to \nsynchronize serial interface reads and writes. \nSDIO/DCS SDIO is the serial data input/output function of \nthe pin. A dual-purpose pin that typically \nserves as an input or an output, depending on \nthe instruction being sent and the relative \nposition in the timing frame.  \nCSB Chip select bar. An active low control that \ngates the read and write cycles.  \nThe falling edge of the CSB, in conjunction with the rising edge \nof the SCLK, determines the start of the framing. See Figure 84 and Table 5 for an example of the serial timing and its definitions.  \nOther modes involving the CSB are available. The CSB can be \nheld low indefinitely, which pe rmanently enables the device; \nthis is called streaming. The CSB can stall high between bytes to allow for additional external timing. When CSB is tied high at power-up, SPI functions are placed in high impedance mode. This mode turns on any SPI pin secondary functions. When CSB is toggled low after power- up, the part remains in SPI \nmode and does not revert back to pin mode. \nDuring an instruction phase, a 16-bit instruction is transmitted. \nData follows the instruction phase, and its length is determined \nby the W0 and W1 bits.  \n  \n \n All data is composed of 8-bit words. The first bit of the first byte  \nin a multibyte serial data transf er frame indicates whether a read \ncommand or a write command is issued. This allows the serial data input/output (SDIO) pin to change direction from an \ninput to an output. \nIn addition to word  length, the instruction phase determines \nwhether the serial frame is a read  or write operation, allowing \nthe serial port to be used both to program the chip and to read \nthe contents of the on-chip me mory. If the instruction is a \nreadback operation, performing a readback causes the serial data input/ \noutput (SDIO) pin to change direct ion from an input to an output \nat the appropriate point in the serial frame. \nData can be sent in MSB-first mode or in LSB-first mode. MSB \nfirst is the default on power-up and can be changed via the SPI port configuration register. For more information about this \nand other features, see Application Note AN-877, Interfacing to  \nHigh Speed ADCs via SPI . \nHARDWARE INTERFACE \nThe pins described in Table 14 co mprise the physical interface \nbetween the user programming device and the serial port of the \nAD9265. The SCLK pin and the CSB pin function as inputs when using the SPI interface. The SDIO pin is bidirectional, \nfunctioning as an input during write phases and as an output \nduring readback.  \nThe AD9265 has a separate supply pin for the SPI interface, \nSVDD. The SVDD pin can be set at any level between 1.8 V  \nand 3.3 V to enable operation with a SPI bus at these voltages without requiring level translation. If the SPI port is not used, SVDD can be tied to the DRVDD voltage. \nThe SPI interface is flexible enou gh to be controlled by either \nFPGAs or microcontrollers. One method for SPI configuration \nis described in detail in Application Note AN-812, Microcontroller-\nBased Serial Port Interface (SPI) Boot Circuit .  \nThe SPI port should not be active during periods when the full \ndynamic performance of the conv erter is required. Because the \nSCLK signal, the CSB signal, and the SDIO signal are typically asynchronous to the ADC clock,  noise from these signals can \ndegrade converter performance. If the on-board SPI bus is used for other devices, it may be necessary to provide buffers between this bus and the AD9265 to prevent these signals from transi-\ntioning at the converter inputs during critical sampling periods. \nSome pins serve a dual function when the SPI interface is not \nbeing used. When the pins are tied to AVDD or ground during \ndevice power-on, they are associated with a specific function. The Digital Outputs section describes those alternate functions that are supported on the AD9265 .  \n \n \nData Sheet AD9265\n \nRev. D | Page 35 of 44 CONFIGURATION WITHOUT THE SPI \nIn applications that do not interf ace to the SPI control registers, \nthe SDIO/DCS pin and the SCLK/DFS pin serve as standalone \nCMOS-compatible control pins. When the device is powered up, it is assumed that the user intends to use the pins as static \ncontrol lines for the duty cycle stabilizer and output data \nformat feature control. In this mode, connect the CSB chip select to AVDD, which disables the serial port interface.  \nThe OEB pin, the DITHER pin, the LVDS pin, the LVDS_RS \npin, and the PDWN pin are active control lines in both external pin mode and SPI mode. The input from these pins or the SPI register setting is used to determine the mode of operation for the part.  \nTable 15.

Serial Port Interface Timing Diagram \n \n \nAD9265 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 36 of 44 MEMORY MAP \nREADING THE MEMORY MAP REGISTER TABLE \nEach row in the memory map regist er table has eight bit locations. \nThe memory map is roughly divided into four sections: the chip \nconfiguration registers (Address 0x00 to Address 0x02); the transfer register (Address 0xFF); the ADC functions registers, \nincluding setup, control, and test (Address 0x08 to Address 0x30); \nand the digital feature contro l register (Address 0x100). \nThe memory map register table (see Table 17) documents the default hexadecimal value for each hexadecimal address shown. The column with the heading, Bit 7 (MSB), is the start of the default hexadecimal value given. For example, Address 0x18,  the VREF select register, has a he xadecimal default value of 0xC0. \nThis means that Bit 7 = 1, Bit 6 = 1, and the remaining bits are 0s. \nThis setting is the default reference selection setting. The default \nvalue uses a 2.0 V p-p reference. For more information on this \nfunction and others, see Application Note AN-877,  Interfacing to \nHigh Speed ADCs via SPI . This document details the functions \ncontrolled by Register 0x00 to Register 0xFF. The remaining \nregister, Register 0x100, is documented in the Memory Map \nRegister Description section.  \nOpen Locations \nAll address and bit locations that are not included in Table 17 are not currently supported for this device. Unused bits of a valid address location should be written with 0s. Writing to these \nlocations is required only when part  of an address location is open \n(for example, Address 0x18). If the entire address location is \nopen (for example, Address 0x13), this address location should not be written.  Default Values \nAfter the AD9265  is reset, critical registers are loaded with \ndefault values. The default values for the registers are given in \nthe memory map register table, Table 17. \nLogic Levels \nAn explanation of logic level terminology follows: \n\uf0b7 “Bit is set” is synonymous with “bit is set to Logic 1” or \n“writing Logic 1 for the bit.”  \n\uf0b7 “Clear a bit” is synonymous with  “bit is set to Logic 0” or \n“writing Logic 0 for the bit.” \nTransfer Register Map \nAddress 0x08 to Address 0x18 ar e shadowed. Writes to these \naddresses do not affect part operation until a transfer command \nis issued by writing 0x01 to Address 0xFF, setting the transfer bit. \nThis allows these registers to be updated internally and simulta-neously when the transfer bit is set. The internal update takes place when the transfer bit is set, and the bit autoclears. \n   \n \n  \nData Sheet AD9265\n \nRev.

D | Page 40 of 44 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nDESIGN GUIDELINES \nBefore starting design and layout of the AD9265 as a system,  \nit is recommended that the designer become familiar with these \nguidelines, which discuss the sp ecial circuit connections and \nlayout requirements that are needed for certain pins. \nPower and Ground Recommendations \nWhen connecting power to the AD9265, it is recommended that two separate 1.8 V supplies be used. Use one supply for analog (AVDD); use a separate supply for the digital outputs (DRVDD). Several different decoupling capacitors can be used to cover both high and low frequencies. Locate these capacitors \nclose to the point of entry at the PCB level and close to the pins \nof the part, with minimal trace length. The power supply for the SPI port, SVDD, should not cont ain excessive noise and should \nalso be bypassed close to the part. \nA single PCB ground plane should be sufficient when using the \nAD9265. With proper decoupling and smart partitioning of the PCB analog, digital, and clock sections, optimum performance \nis easily achieved. \nLVDS Operation \nThe AD9265 can be configured for CMOS or LVDS output mode \non power-up using the LVDS pin, Pin 44. If LVDS operation is \ndesired, connect Pin 44 to AVDD. LVDS operation can also be \nenabled through the SPI port. If  CMOS operation is desired, \nconnect Pin 44 to AGND. \nExposed Paddle Thermal Heat Slug Recommendations \nIt is mandatory that the expose d paddle on the underside of the \nADC be connected to the analog ground (AGND) to achieve \nthe best electrical and therma l performance. A continuous, \nexposed (no solder mask) copper plane on the PCB should mate to the AD9265 exposed paddle, Pin 0.  \nThe copper plane should have several vias to achieve the lowest possible resistive thermal path for heat dissipation to flow through the bottom of the PCB. Fill or plug these vias with nonconductive epoxy. To maximize the coverage and adhesion between the ADC and the PCB, overlay a silkscreen to partition the continuous plane on the PCB into several uniform sections. This provides several tie points between the ADC and the PCB during the reflow process. \nUsing one continuous plane with no partitions guarantees only \none tie point between the ADC and the PCB. For detailed information about packaging and PCB layout of chip scale \npackages, see Application Note AN-772, A Design and \nManufacturing Guide for the Le ad Frame Chip Scale Package \n(LFCSP) . \nVCM \nDecouple the VCM pin to ground with a 0.1 μF capacitor, as \nshown in Figure 67. \nRBIAS \nThe AD9265 requires that a 10 kΩ resistor be placed between \nthe RBIAS pin and ground. This re sistor sets the master current \nreference of the ADC core and shou ld have at least a 1% tolerance. \nReference Decoupling \nDecouple the VREF pin externa lly to ground with a low ESR, \n1.0 μF capacitor in parallel with a low ESR, 0.1 μF ceramic capacitor.  \nSPI Port \nThe SPI port should not be active during periods when the full dynamic performance of the conv erter is required. Because the \nSCLK, CSB, and SDIO signals are typically asynchronous to the ADC clock, noise from these signals can degrade converter per-\nformance. If the on-boa rd SPI bus is used for other devices, it \nmay be necessary to provide buffers between this bus and the \nAD9265 to keep these signals from transitioning at the converter inputs during critical sampling periods. \n    \n  \nData Sheet AD9265\n \nRev.
