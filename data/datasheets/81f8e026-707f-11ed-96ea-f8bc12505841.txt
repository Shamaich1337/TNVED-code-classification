When the MAX3221/MAX3223/MAX3243 do not \nsense a valid signal level on their receiver inputs, the on-board power supply and drivers shut down. This occurs if the RS-232 cable is disconnected or if the transmitters \nof the connected peripheral are turned off. The system \nturns on again when a valid level is applied to any RS-232 receiver input.\nThe MAX3221/MAX3223/MAX3243 require only 0.1µF \ncapacitors in 3.3V operation, and can operate from input \nvoltages ranging from +3.0V to +5.5V.\nA proprietary, high-efficiency, dual charge-pump power \nsupply and a low-dropout transmitter combine to deliver \ntrue RS-232 performance from a single +3.0V to +5.5V \nsupply.\nThe MAX3221 is a 1-driver/1-receiver 16-pin SSOP  \nversion of the 20-pin 2-driver/2-receiver MAX3223.The MAX3243 is a 3-driver/5-receiver with a complementary \nalways-active receiver for external monitoring in a variety  \nof 28 pin packages.

The charge  \npumps operate in a discontinuous mode: if the output  \nvoltages are less than 5.5V, the charge pumps are enabled; if the output voltages exceed 5.5V, the charge pumps are disabled. Each charge pump requires a flying \ncapacitor (C1, C2) and a reservoir capacitor (C3, C4) to \ngenerate the V+ and V- supplies.RS-232 Transmitters\nThe transmitters are inverting level translators that  \nconvert CMOS-logic levels to 5.0V EIA/TIA-232 levels. \nThey guarantee a 120kbps data rate with worst-case \nloads of 3kΩ in parallel with 1000pF, providing compatibility with PC-to-PC communication software (such as Laplink™). \nTypically, the MAX3221/MAX3223/MAX3243 can operate \nat data rates of 235kbps. Transmitters can be paralleled \nto drive multiple receivers or mice (MAX3243). Figure 1 \nshows a complete system connection.\nWhen FORCEOFF is driven to ground, or the auto-shut-\ndown circuitry senses invalid voltage levels at all receiver \ninputs, the transmitters are disabled and the outputs are \nforced into a high-impedance state.\nLapLink is a trademark of Traveling Software.PIN\nNAME FUNCTION\nMAX3221 MAX3223 MAX3243\n1 1 — ENReceiver Enable Control.

All receiv-\ners have one inverting three-state output. In shutdown \n(FORCEOFF  = low) or in AutoShutdown, the MAX3221/\nMAX3223’s receivers are active (Table 1). Driving EN high \nplaces the receiver(s) in a high-impedance state. The MAX3243’s receivers are high impedance when the part \nis shut down.\nThe MAX3243 has an always-active complementary  \noutput (R2OUTB). R2OUTB is an extra output that  \nmonitors receiver activity while the other receivers \nare high impedance. This allows Ring Indicator to be  \nmonitored without forward biasing other devices  \nconnected to the receiver outputs. This is ideal for  \nsystems where V\nCC is set to 0V in shutdown to  \naccommodate peripherals, such as UARTs (Figure 2).Figure 2.

When the MAX3221/\nMAX3223/MAX3243 sense no valid signal levels on all receiver inputs for 30µs, the on-board power supply and \ndrivers are shut off, reducing supply current to 1µA. This \noccurs if the RS-232 cable is disconnected or the con-\nnected peripheral transmitters are turned off. The system \nturns on again when a valid level is applied to any RS-232 receiver input. As a result, the system saves power with-\nout changes to the existing BIOS or operating system. \nWhen using AutoShutdown, the INVALID output is high when the device is on and low when the device is shut \ndown. Because INVALID indicates the receiver inputs’ \ncondition, it can be used in any mode (Figure 3).\nTable 2 and Figure 3c summarize the MAX3221/\nMAX3223/MAX3243 operating modes. FORCEON and \nFORCEOFF  override the automatic circuitry and force the \ntransceiver into its normal operating state or into its low-\npower standby state. When neither control is asserted, \nthe IC selects between these states automatically based \non receiver input levels. Figures 3a, 3b, and 5a depict valid and invalid RS-232 receiver levels. \nA mouse or other system with AutoShutdown may need \ntime to wake up. Figure 4 shows a circuit that forces the \ntransmitters on for 100ms, allowing enough time for the other system to realize that the MAX3221/MAX3223/*Note: If the part is in AutoShutdown mode ( FORCEOFF  \n= VCC, FORCEON = GND), it is shut down if no valid RS-232 \nlevels are present on all receiver inputs.Table 1a.

If the other system outputs valid \nRS-232 signals within that time, the RS-232 ports on both \nsystems remain enabled.\nWhen shut down, the device’s charge pumps are turned \noff, V+ decays to V CC, V- decays to ground, and \nthe transmitter outputs are disabled (high impedance).  \nThe time required to exit shutdown is typically 100µs \n(Figure 5b).\nSoftware-Controlled Shutdown\nIf direct software control is desired, INVALID can be used \nto indicate DTR or Ring Indicator signal. Tie FORCEOFF \nand FORCEON together to bypass AutoShutdown so the \nline acts like a SHDN input. \nApplications Information\nCapacitor Selection\nThe capacitor type used for C1–C4 is not critical for  \nproper operation; either polarized or nonpolarized capaci -\ntors may be used. The charge pump requires 0.1µF \ncapacitors for 3.3V operation. For other supply voltages, refer to Table 3 for required capacitor values. Do not use \nvalues smaller than those listed in Table 3. Increasing \nthe capacitor values (e.g., by a factor of 2) reduces ripple \non the transmitter outputs and slightly reduces power \nconsumption. C2, C3, and C4 can be increased without changing C1’s value. However, do not increase C1 \nwithout also increasing the values of C2, C3, and \nC4 to maintain the proper ratios (C1 to the other  \ncapacitors).\nWhen using the minimum required capacitor values, \nmake sure the capacitor value does not degrade exces-\nsively with temperature. If in doubt, use capacitors with \na larger nominal value. The capacitor’s equivalent series resistance (ESR) usually rises at low temperatures and \ninfluences the amount of ripple on V+ and V-.Table 2. AutoShutdown Logic\nFigure 5.

As they become active, the two trans-\nmitter outputs are shown going to opposite RS-232 \nlevels. Each transmitter is loaded with 3kΩ in parallel with 2500pF.

Figure 7b is a mouse driver test \ncircuit.\nMouse Driveability (MAX3243)\nThe MAX3243 has been specifically designed to power \nserial mice while operating from low-voltage power \nsupplies. It has been tested with samples of ten major \nmouse models from six manufacturers including the leading three: Logitech (5 models), Mouse Systems, \nand Microsoft. The MAX3243 successfully drove all serial mice and met their respective current and voltage requirements. Figure 7a shows the transmitter outputs \nunder increasing load current. The MAX3243’s switching  \nregulator ensures the transmitters will supply at least \n±5V during worst-case conditions. The AutoShutdown \nfeature does not work with a mouse, so FORCEOFF  and \nFORCEON should be connected to V\nCC.\nHigh Data Rates\nThe MAX3221/MAX3223/MAX3243 maintain the RS-232 ±5.0V minimum transmitter output voltage even at high \ndata rates. Figure 8 shows a transmitter loopback test \ncircuit. Figure 9 shows a loopback test result at 120kbps, and Figure 10 shows the same test at 235kbps. For \nFigure 9, all three transmitters were driv-en simultaneously \nat 120kbps into RS-232 loads in parallel with 1000pF. For \nFigure 10, a single transmitter was driven at 235kbps, \nbut all three transmitters were loaded with an RS-232 receiver in parallel with 1000pF.\nInterconnection with  \n3V and 5V Logic\nThe MAX3221/MAX3223/MAX3243 can directly interface with various 5V logic families, including ACT and HCT \nCMOS. See Table 4 for more information on possible \ncombinations of interconnections.Figure 6. Transmitter Outputs When Exiting Shutdown or \nPowering UpFigure 7a.

#### Description:
The **MAX3221EAE+T** is a low-power RS-232 transceiver designed for battery-powered and portable applications. It features a single driver and receiver, capable of converting CMOS logic levels to RS-232 levels and vice versa. The device operates from a single supply voltage ranging from +3.0V to +5.5V and incorporates a dual charge pump to generate the necessary RS-232 voltage levels without requiring additional power supplies.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Battery-Powered Equipment**: Ideal for devices that require low power consumption.
- **Hand-Held Equipment**: Suitable for portable devices that need RS-232 communication.
- **Peripherals**: Can be used in various peripheral devices that communicate via RS-232.
- **Portable Diagnostics Equipment**: Useful in diagnostic tools that require serial communication.

The MAX3221EAE+T is particularly beneficial in applications where power efficiency is critical, such as in mobile devices and systems that need to maintain low power states while still being able to communicate when necessary.
