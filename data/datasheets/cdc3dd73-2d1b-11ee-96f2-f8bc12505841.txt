Use Precautions  \n11.1  Handling precautions  \n(1) The polarizing plate may break easily so be careful when handling it. Do not touch, \npress or rub it with a hard -material tool like tweezers.  \n(2) Do not touch the polarizing plate surface with bare hands so as not to make it dirty. \nIf the surface or other related part of the polarizing plate is dirty, soak a soft cotton \ncloth or chamois leather in benzine and wipe off with it. Do not use chemical \nliquids such as acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol. Failure to do so may bring \nchemical reaction phenomena and deteriorations.  \n(3) Remove any spit or water immediately. If it is left for hours, the suffered part may \ndeform or decolorize.  \n(4) If the LCD element breaks and any LC stuff leaks, do not suck or lick it. Also if LC \nstuff is stuck on your skin or clothing, wash thoroughly with soap and water \nimmediately.  \n \n11.2  Installing precautions  \n(1) The PCB has many I Cs that may be damaged easily by static electricity. To \nprevent breaking by static electricity from the human body and clothing, earth the \nhuman body properly using the high resistance and discharge static electricity \nduring the operation. In this case, however, the resistance value should be approx. \n1MΩ and the  resistance should be placed near the human body rather than the \nground surface. When the indoor space is dry, static electricity may occur easily \nso be careful. We recommend the indoor space should be kept with humidity of \n60% or more. When a soldering ir on or other similar tool is used for assembly, be \nsure to earth it.  \n(2) When installing the module and ICs, do not bend or twist them. Failure to do so \nmay crack LC element and cause circuit failure.  \n(3) To protect LC element, especially polarizing plate, use a tr ansparent protective \nplate (e.g., acrylic plate, glass etc) for the product case.  \n(4) Do not use an adhesive like a both -side adhesive tape to make LCD surface \n(polarizing plate) and product case stick together. Failure to do so may cause the \npolarizing plate to peel off.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDate: 20 22/03/28                   AMPIRE CO., LTD.                     21 11.3  Storage precautions  \n(1) Avoid a high temperature and humidity area. Keep the temperature between 0°C \nand 35°C and also the humidity under 60%.  \n(2) Choose the dark spaces where the product is not exposed to direct sunlight or \nfluorescent light.  \n(3) Store the products as they are put in the boxes provided from us or in the same \nconditions as we recommend.  \n \n11.4  Operating precautions  \n(1) Do not boost the applied drive voltage abnormally. Failure to do so may break ICs. \nWhen applying power voltage, check the electrical features beforehand and be \ncareful. Always turn off the power to the LC module controller before removing or \ninserting the LC module input connector. If the input connector is removed or \ninserted while the power is turned on, the LC module inter nal circuit may break.  \n(2) The display response may be late if the operating temperature is under the \nnormal standard, and the display may be out of order if it is above the normal \nstandard. But this is not a failure; this will be restored if it is within the normal \nstandard.  \n(3) The LCD contrast varies depending on the visual angle, ambient temperature, \npower voltage etc. Obtain the optimum contrast by adjusting the LC dive voltage.  \n(4) When carrying out the test, do not take the module out of the low -temperature \nspac e suddenly. Failure to do so will cause the module condensing, leading to \nmalfunctions.  \n(5) Make certain that each signal noise level is within the standard (L level: 0.2Vdd or \nless and H level: 0.8Vdd or more) even if the module has functioned properly. If it  \nis beyond the standard, the module may often malfunction. In addition, always \nconnect the module when making noise level measurements.  \n(6) The CMOS ICs are incorporated in the module and the pull -up and pull -down \nfunction is not adopted for the input so avoid  putting the input signal open while \nthe power is ON.  \n(7) The characteristic of the semiconductor element changes when it is exposed to \nlight emissions, therefore ICs on the LCD may malfunction if they receive light \nemissions. To prevent these malfunctions, de sign and assemble ICs so that they \nare shielded from light emissions.  \n(8) Crosstalk occurs because of characteristics of the LCD. In general, crosstalk \noccurs when the regularized display is maintained. Also, crosstalk is affected by \nthe LC drive voltage. Desi gn the contents of the display, considering crosstalk.  \n \n \n \n \nDate: 20 22/03/28                   AMPIRE CO., LTD.                     22 11.5  Other  \n(1) Do not disassemble or take the LC module into pieces. The LC modules once \ndisassembled or taken into pieces are not the guarantee articles.  \n(2) Do not keep the LCD at the same display pattern co ntinually. The residual image \nwill happen and it will damage the LCD. Please use screen saver . \n(3) AMIPRE will provide one year warrantee for all products and three months \nwarrantee for all repairing products.  \nDate: 20 22/03/28                   AMPIRE CO., LTD.                     23 12.
