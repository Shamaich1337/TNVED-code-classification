Using a built-in charge pump, the devices control two external back-to-back n-channel MOSFETs that turn off and isolate  \ndownstream power supplies during damaging input  \nconditions, such as an automotive load-dump pulse or a reverse-battery condition. Operation is guaranteed down \nto 3V that ensures proper operation during automotive \ncold-crank conditions. These devices feature a flag output \n(FLAG) that asserts during fault conditions.\nFor reverse-voltage protection, external back-to-back \nMOSFETs outperform the traditional reverse-battery \ndiode, minimizing the voltage drop and power dissipation during normal operation.\nThe devices use fixed overvoltage and undervoltage \nthresholds, minimizing the external component count.\nThe MAX16129 provides limiter-mode fault management \nfor overvoltage and thermal-shutdown conditions; whereas \nthe MAX16128 provides switch-mode fault management \nfor overvoltage and thermal shutdown conditions. In the \nlimiter mode, the output voltage is limited and FLAG is  \nasserted low during a fault. In the switch mode, the  \nexternal MOSFETs are switched off and FLAG is asserted \nlow after a fault. The switch mode is available in four \noptions—Latch mode, 1 Autoretry mode, 3 Autoretry \nmode, and Always autoretry mode.\nThe MAX16128/MAX16129 are available in an 8-pin \nµMAX\n® package and operate over the automotive  \ntemperature range (-40°C to +125°C).\nApplications\n ●Automotive\n ●Industrial\n ●Avionics\n ●Telecom/Server/NetworkingBenefits and Features\n ●Increases Protection of Sensitive Electronic Components in Harsh Environments\n• -36V to +90V Wide Input-Voltage Protection Range\n• Fast Gate Shutoff During Fault Conditions with \nComplete Load Isolation\n• Thermal Shutdown Protection\n• FLAG Output Identifies Fault Condition\n ●Automotive Qualified\n• Operates Down to +3V, Riding Out Cold-Crank \nConditions\n•  -40°C to +125°C Operating Temperature Range\n ●Integration Reduces Solution Size\n• Internal Charge-Pump Circuit Enhances External n-Channel MOSFET\n• Fixed Undervoltage/Overvoltage Thresholds\n• 3mm × 3mm, 8-Pin µMAX Package\n ●Reduced Power Dissipation Compared to Discrete \nSolutions\n• Minimal Operating Voltage Drop for Reverse-  \nVoltage Protection\n• 380µA Supply Current and 100µA Shutdown  \nCurrent at 30V Input\nOrdering Information appears at end of data sheet.\n19-6146; Rev 6; 8/19\nMAX16128/MAX16129 Load-Dump/Reverse-Voltage Protection CircuitsClick here for production status of specific part numbers.\nµMAX \nJunction-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance (θ JA) ....... 77.6°C/W \nJunction-to-Case Thermal Resistance (θ JC) ................. 5°C/W(All pins referenced to GND.)\nIN  ............................................................................ -36V to +90V\nSHDN ........................................... -0.3V to max (0V, V IN + 0.3V)\nSRC, GATE ............................................................ -36V to +45V\nSRC to GATE ......................................................... -36V to +30V\nOUT  ....................................................................... -0.3V to +45V\nFLAG ..................................................................... -0.3V to +45V\nContinuous Sink/Source (All Pins) ................................. ±100mAContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70°C) (multilayer board)  \nµMAX (derate 12.9mW/°C above +70°C) .............. 1030.9mW\nOperating Temperature Range  ......................... -40°C to +125°C\nJunction Temperature ...................................................... +150°C\nStorage Temperature Range  ............................ -60°C to +150°C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s) ................................. +300°C\nSoldering Temperature (reflow) ....................................... +260°C\n(Note 1)\n(VIN = 12V, C GATE-SOURCE  = 1nF, T A = -40°C to +125°C, unless otherwise noted.

The devices monitor the input volt-age and control two external common-source n-channel MOSFETs to protect downstream voltage regulators dur-\ning load-dump events or other automotive pulse condi -\ntions.\nThe devices feature an overvoltage and an undervoltage \ncomparator for voltage window detection. A flag output \n(FLAG) asserts when a fault event occurs.\nTwo external back-to-back n-channel MOSFETs provide \nreverse-voltage protection and also prevent reverse  \ncurrent during a fault condition. Compared to a traditional reverse-battery diode, this approach minimizes power dis-\nsipation and voltage drop.\nThe MAX16129 provides a limiter-mode fault manage -\nment for overvoltage and thermal-shutdown conditions, \nwhereas the MAX16128 provides switch-mode fault management for overvoltage and thermal-shutdown con-\nditions. In the limiter mode, the MOSFETs cycle on and \noff so the output voltage is limited. In the switch mode, \nthe external MOSFETs are switched off, disconnecting \nthe load from the input. In both cases, FLAG asserts to \nindicate a fault.\nGate Charge Pump\nThe devices use a charge pump to generate the GATE to SRC voltage and enhance the external MOSFETs. After \nthe input voltage exceeds the input undervoltage thresh-\nold, the charge pump turns on after a 150µs delay.\nDuring a fault condition, GATE is pulled to ground with \nan 8.8mA (min) pulldown current. Note that an exter-nal zener diode is required to be connected between \nthe gate and source of the external MOSFETs (see the \nApplications Information section).\nOvervoltage Protection\nThe devices detect overvoltage conditions using a com-parator that is connected through an internal resistive \ndivider to the input or output voltage. An overvoltage \ncondition causes the GATE output to go low, turning off the external MOSFETs. FLAG also asserts to indicate the \nfault condition.Overvoltage Limiter (MAX16129)\nIn overvoltage-limiter mode, the output voltage is regu-lated at the overvoltage-threshold voltage and continues \nto supply power to downstream devices. In this mode, the \ndevice operates like a voltage regulator.\nDuring normal operation, GATE is enhanced 9V above \nSRC. The output voltage is monitored through an internal \nresistive divider. When OUT rises above the overvoltage threshold, GATE goes low and the MOSFETs turn off. As \nthe voltage on OUT falls below the overvoltage threshold \nminus the threshold hysteresis, GATE goes high and \nthe MOSFETs turn back on again, regulating OUT in a \nswitched-linear mode at the overvoltage threshold.\nThe switching frequency depends on the gate charge of \nthe MOSFETs, the charge-pump current, the output load \ncurrent, and the output capacitance.\nCaution must be exercised when operating the \nMAX16129 in voltage-limiting mode for long durations. \nSince MOSFETs can dissipate power continuously during \nthis interval, proper heatsinking should be implemented to prevent damage to them.\nOvervoltage Switch (MAX16128)\nIn the overvoltage switch mode, the internal overvolt-age comparator monitors the input voltage and the load \nis completely disconnected from the input during an \novervoltage event. When the input voltage exceeds the overvoltage threshold, GATE goes low and the MOSFETs \nturn off, disconnecting the input from the load. After that, \nfor the autoretry-mode version, the autoretry timer starts, \nwhile for the latched-mode version a power cycle to IN or \na cycle on SHDN is needed to turn the external MOSFETs back on.\nThe MAX16128 can be configured to latch off (suffix D) \neven after the overvoltage condition ends. The latch is \ncleared by cycling IN below the undervoltage threshold or \nby toggling SHDN.\nThe devices can also be configured to retry:\n ●One time, then latch off (suffix B)\n ●Three times, then latch off (suffix C)\n ●Always retry and never latch off (suffix A)\nThere is a fixed 150ms (typ) delay between each retry \nattempt. If the overvoltage-fault condition is gone when \na retry is attempted, GATE goes high and power is \nrestored to the downstream circuitry.\nMAX16128/MAX16129 Load-Dump/Reverse-Voltage Protection Circuits\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 8\nUndervoltage Protection\nThe devices monitor the input voltage for undervoltage \nconditions. If the input voltage is below the undervoltage \nthreshold (V IN < V UV_TH  - V UV_HYS ), GATE goes low, \nturning off the external MOSFETs and FLAG asserts. \nWhen the input voltage exceeds the undervoltage threshold (V\nIN > V UV_TH ), GATE goes high after a 150µs delay \n(typ).\nFor the MAX16128/MAX16129, the undervoltage threshold \nis determined by the part number suffix option (see  Table 2).\nCold-Crank Monitoring\nCold-crank faults occur when the input voltage decreases \nfrom its steady-state condition. A cold-crank compara -\ntor monitors IN through an internal resistive divider. The MAX16128/MAX16129 offer two ways to handle this kind of fault depending on a part number suffix (see the \nSelector Guide):\n ●The cold-crank comparator is disabled and external \nMOSFETs stay on during the falling input-voltage transient unless the input voltage falls below the un-dervoltage threshold (see Table 2 ).\n ●The cold-crank comparator is enabled and external MOSFETs are switched off by pulling down GATE if the input voltage falls below the cold-crank threshold \nto avoid load discharge due to reverse current from \nOUT to IN (see Table 4 ).\nIn the last case, cold-crank protection is enabled as long \nas V\nOUT is higher than 90% of V IN (with a 3% hysteresis) \nand V IN is higher than the undervoltage threshold. When \nthe monitored input voltage falls below the falling cold-\ncrank fault threshold (V IN < V CCK), the GATE is pulled \ndown and FLAG is asserted low. When the input voltage rises back above the rising cold-crank fault threshold \n(V\nIN > V CCK + V CLK_HYS ), FLAG is released and the \ncharge pump enhances GATE above SRC, reconnecting \nthe load to the input.\nThermal Shutdown\nThe devices’ thermal-shutdown feature turns off the \nMOSFETs if the internal die temperature exceeds 145°C \n(TJ). By ensuring good thermal coupling between the \nMOSFETs and the devices, the thermal shutdown can turn off the MOSFETs if they overheat.\nWhen the junction temperature exceeds T\nJ = +145°C \n(typ), the internal thermal sensor signals the shutdown \nlogic, pulling the GATE voltage low and allowing the \ndevice to cool. When T J drops by 15°C (typ), GATE goes \nhigh and the MOSFETs turn back on. Do not exceed the absolute maximum junction-temperature rating of TJ = +150°C.\nFlag Output ( FLAG)\nAn open-drain FLAG output indicates fault conditions. During startup, FLAG is initially low and goes high imped -\nance when V\nOUT is greater than 90% of V IN if no fault \nconditions are present. FLAG asserts low during shut-\ndown mode, an overvoltage, thermal shutdown, or under -\nvoltage fault, or when V OUT falls below 90% of V IN. In \nthe versions where the cold-crank comparator is enabled, FLAG asserts low during a cold-crank fault.\nReverse-Voltage Protection\nThe devices integrate reverse-voltage protection, pre-\nventing damage to the downstream circuitry caused by \nbattery reversal or negative transients. The devices can \nwithstand reverse voltage to -36V without damage to themselves or the load. During a reverse-voltage condi -\ntion, the two external n-channel MOSFETs are turned off, protecting the load. Connect a 0.1µF ceramic capacitor \nfrom IN to GND connect a 10µF capacitor from OUT to \nGND, and minimize the parasitic capacitance from GATE \nto GND to have fast reverse-battery voltage-transient \nprotection. During normal operation, both MOSFETs are turned on and have a minimal forward-voltage drop, pro-\nviding lower power dissipation and a much lower voltage \ndrop than a reverse-battery protection diode.\nApplications Information\nAutomotive Electrical Transients \n(Load Dump)\n ●Automotive circuits generally require supply voltage \nprotection from various transient conditions that occur in automotive systems. Several standards define various pulses that can occur. Table 1 summarizes the pulses \nfrom the ISO 7637-2 and ISO 16750-2 specification.\nMost of the pulses can be mitigated with capacitors \nand zener clamp diodes (see the Typical Operating Characteristics  and also the Increasing the Operating \nVoltage Range  section). The load dump (pulse 5a and \n5b) occurs when the alternator is charging the battery and a battery terminal gets disconnected. Due to the sudden \nchange in load, the alternator goes out of regulation \nand the bus voltage spikes. The pulse has a rise time \nof about 10ms and a fall time of about 400ms but can \nextend out to 1s or more depending on the characteris -\ntics of the charging system. The magnitude of the pulse depends on the bus voltage and whether the system is unsuppressed or uses central load-dump suppression \nMAX16128/MAX16129 Load-Dump/Reverse-Voltage Protection Circuits\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 9\n(generally implemented using very large clamp diodes \nbuilt into the alternator). Table 1 lists the worst-case  \nvalues from the ISO 7637-2 specification.\nCold crank (pulse 4) occurs when activating the starter \nmotor in cold weather with a marginal battery. Due to the \nlarge load imposed by the starter motor, the bus voltage sags. Since the devices can operate down to 3V, the \ndownstream circuitry can continue to operate through a \ncold-crank condition. If desired, the undervoltage thresh-\nold can be increased so that the MOSFETs turn off during \na cold crank, disconnecting the downstream circuitry. An output reservoir capacitor can be connected from OUT to \nGND to provide energy to the circuit during the cold-crank \ncondition.\nRefer to the ISO 7637-2 specification for details on pulse \nwaveforms, test conditions, and test fixtures.\nMOSFET Selection\nMOSFET selection is critical to design a proper protec-tion circuit. Several factors must be taken into account: \nthe gate capacitance, the drain-to-source voltage rating, \nthe on-resistance (R\nDS(ON) ), the peak power-dissipation \ncapability, and the average power-dissipation limit. In gen-eral, both MOSFETs should have the same part number. For size-constrained applications, a dual MOSFET can \nsave board area. Select the drain-to-source voltage so \nthat the MOSFETs can handle the highest voltage that might be applied to the circuit. Gate capacitance is not \nas critical but it does determine the maximum turn-on and turn-off time. MOSFETs with more gate capacitance \ntend to respond more slowly.\nMOSFET Power Dissipation\nThe R DS(ON)  must be low enough to limit the MOSFET \npower dissipation during normal operation. Power  \ndissipation (per MOSFET) during normal operation can be calculated using this formula:\nP = I\nLOAD2 × R DS(ON)\nwhere P is the power dissipated in each MOSFET and I\nLOAD  is the average load current.\nDuring a fault condition in switch mode, the MOSFETs turn off and do not dissipate power. Limiter mode imposes the worst-case power dissipation. The average power can \nbe computed using the following formula:\nP = I\nLOAD  × (V IN - VOUT)\nwhere P is the average power dissipated in both MOSFETs, \nILOAD  is the average load current, V IN is the input volt-\nage, and V OUT is the average limited voltage on the \noutput. In limiter mode, the output voltage is a sawtooth \nwave with characteristics determined by the R DS(ON)  of \nthe MOSFETs, the output load current, the output capaci -\ntance, the gate charge of the MOSFETs, and the GATE \ncharge-pump current.\nSince limiter mode can involve high switching currents \nwhen the GATE is turning on at the start of a limiting cycle (especially when the output capacitance is high), it \nis important to ensure the circuit does not violate the peak \npower rating of the MOSFETs.

The cathode \nconnects to the gate, and the anode connects to the \nsource. Choose the zener clamp voltage to be above 10V and below the MOSFET V\nGS maximum rating.\nIncreasing the Input Voltage Protection Range\nThe devices can tolerate -36V to +90V. To increase the positive input-voltage protection range, connect two \nback-to-back zener diodes from IN to GND, and connect \na resistor in series with IN and the power-supply input to limit the current drawn by the zener diodes (see Figure 1).\nZener diode D1 clamps positive voltage excursions and \nD2 clamps negative voltage excursions. Set the zener voltages so the worst-case voltages do not exceed the \nratings of the part. Also ensure that the zener diode \npower ratings are not exceeded. The combination of \nthe series resistor and the zener diodes also help snub \npulses on the supply voltage input and can aid in clamping the low-energy ISO 7637-2 pulses.It is important to compute the peak power dissipation in \nthe series resistor. Most standard surface-mount resistors \nare not able to withstand the peak power dissipation during \ncertain pulse events. Check the resistor data sheets for  \npulse-power derating curves. If necessary, connect  \nmultiple resistors in parallel or use automotive-rated resistors.\nThe shutdown input needs a series resistor to limit the \ncurrent if V\nIN exceeds the clamped voltage on IN. A good \nstarting point is 100kW.\nOutput Reservoir Capacitor\nThe output capacitor can be used as a reservoir capaci-\ntor to allow downstream circuitry to “ride out” fault \ntransient conditions. Since the voltage at the output is \nprotected from input-voltage transients, the capacitor voltage rating can be less than the expected maximum \ninput voltage.\nFigure 1.
