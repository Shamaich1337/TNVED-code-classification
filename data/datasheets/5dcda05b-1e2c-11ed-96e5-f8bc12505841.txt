These comparators have a 188ns propagation delay and consume 35μA of supply current \nper comparator over the -40°C to +125°C operating tem-\nperature range. The combination of low-power, single-\nsupply operation down to +2.5V, and ultra-small footprint \nmakes these devices ideal for portable applications.\nThe MAX9030 is a low-cost single comparator with shut-\ndown. The MAX9031, MAX9032, and MAX9034 are low-\ncost single, dual, and quad comparators without shutdown, \nrespectively. The comparators’ 4mV of built-in hysteresis provides noise immunity and prevents oscillations even \nwith a slow-moving input signal. The input common-mode \nrange extends from the negative supply to within 1.1V of the positive supply. The design of the comparator output \nstage substantially reduces switching current during output \ntransitions, virtually eliminating power-supply glitches. The \nMAX9030 single comparator with shutdown is available in \nthe space-saving 6-pin SC70 and SOT23 packages.\nThe MAX9031 single comparator is available in tiny \n5-pin SC70 and SOT23 packages.

They have an operating \nsupply voltage from +2.5V to +5.5V when operating from \na single supply and from ±1.25V to ±2.75V when operat-ing from dual power supplies, and consume only 35μA. \nTheir common-mode input voltage range extends from \nthe negative supply to within 1.1V of the positive supply. \nInternal hysteresis ensures clean output switching, even \nwith slow-moving input signals.\nShutdown Mode\nThe MAX9030 comparator comes with a power-saving shutdown mode. When in shutdown, the supply current \ndrops from a typical 35μA to 0.05μA, and the outputs \nbecome high impedance. SHDN has a high input imped -\nance and typically draws 0.1μA when connected to V\nSS or \nVDD. A maximum logic low voltage of 0.3V x V DD applied to SHDN places the device in the shutdown mode. A mini-\nmum logic high voltage of 0.7V x V DD applied to SHDN \nwill enable normal operation. To disable shutdown, con-\nnect SHDN to V DD.\nApplications Information\nAdding Hysteresis\nHysteresis extends the comparator’s noise margin by \nincreasing the upper threshold and decreasing the lower \nthreshold. A voltage-divider from the output of the com-\nparator sets the trip voltage. Therefore, the trip voltage is related to the output voltage.\nThese comparators have 4mV internal hysteresis. \nAdditional hysteresis can be generated with two resistors \nusing positive feedback (Figure 1). Use the following pro-\ncedure to calculate resistor values:PIN\nNAME FUNCTION\nMAX9030 MAX9031 MAX9032 MAX9034\n1 1 — — IN+ Comparator Noninverting Input\n2 2 4 11 VSS Negative Supply Voltage.

V TL is the threshold voltage at which the \ncomparator switches its output from low to high as V IN \ndrops below the trip point.\n2) The hysteresis band will be:\nVHYS = VTH - VTL = VDD(R2 / (R1 + R2))\n3) In this example, let V DD = +5V and V REF = +2.5V.\nVTH = 2.5V + 2.5(R2 / (R1 + R2))V\nand\nVTL = 2.5[1 - (R2 / (R1 + R2))]\n4) Select R2. In this example, we will choose 1kΩ.\n5) Select V HYS. In this example, we will choose 50mV.\n6) Solve for R1.\nVHYS = VDD(R2 / (R1 + R2))\n0.050V = 5(1000Ω/(R1 + 1000Ω))V\nwhere R1 ≈ 100kΩ, V TH = 2.525V, and V TL = 2.475V.\nThe above-described design procedure assumes rail-to- \nrail output swing. If the output is significantly loaded, the \nresults should be corrected.Board Layout and Bypassing\nUse 100nF bypass as a starting point. Minimize signal \ntrace lengths to reduce stray capacitance. Minimize the \ncapacitive coupling between IN- and OUT. For slow- \nmoving input signals (rise-time > 1ms), use a 1nF capaci -\ntor between IN+ and IN-.\nBiasing for Data Recovery\nDigital data is often embedded into a bandwidth and amplitude-limited analog path. Recovering the data can \nbe difficult. Figure 2 compares the input signal to a time-\naveraged version of itself. This self-biases the threshold to the average input voltage for optimal noise margin. \nEven severe phase distortion is eliminated from the digital \noutput signal. Be sure to choose R1 and C1 so that:\nƒ\nCAR >> 1 / (2πR1C1)\nwhere ƒ CAR is the fundamental carrier frequency of the \ndigital data stream.Figure 1. Additional Hysteresis Figure 2.
