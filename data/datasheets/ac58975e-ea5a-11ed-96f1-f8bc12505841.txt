By looking at the typical performance charac teristics an d \nthe specifications, the effects of the power supplies ca n be \nclearly seen. \nFor VDD = 1.8 V o peration, R ON is typ ically 40 Ω o ver the \ntemperature range. \nON RESPON SE VS.

This ca pacitance creates a frequency \nzero in the numera tor of the transfer f unction A(s). B ecause the \nswitch on r esistance is smal l, this zer o usually occurs at high \nfrequencies. The bandwidth is a function of the switch output \ncapacitance com bined with CDS and  the load capacitance. The \nfrequency pole corresponding to these capacitances appears in \nthe denominator of A(s). \nThe do minant effect of the output capacitance, CD, causes the \npole breakpoint frequency to occur first.
