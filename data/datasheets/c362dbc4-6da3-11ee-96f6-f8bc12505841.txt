Programming Cables  \nLattice Programming Cable products are the hardware connection for in -system prog ramming of all Lattice devices. \nAfter user  complete the logic design and create a programming file with the Lattice Diamond ®/ispLEVER ® \nClassic /Radiant  development tools, user  can use Diamond /Radiant  Programmer or ispVM ™ System software to \nprogram devices o n board. The ispVM System/Diamond /Radiant  Programmer software automatically generates the \nappropriate programming commands, programming addresses and programming data based on information stored in \nthe programming file and parameters set in Diamond /Radi ant Programmer/ispVM System. Programming signals are \nthen generated from the USB or parallel port of a PC and directed through the programming cable to the device. No \nadditional components are required for programming.  \nNote : Port A is for JTAG programming. Radiant programming software can use the built -in cable via the USB hub on the \nPC, which detects the cable of the USB function on Port A . While Port B is for UART/I2C interface access.  \nDiamond Programmer /Radiant Programmer /ispVM System software is included w ith all Lattice design tool products \nand is available for download from the Lattice web site at www.latticesemi.com/programmer . \n\nProgramming Cables    \nUser Guide  \n \n© 2009 -2023  Lattice Semiconductor Corp.

Programming Cable Pin Definitions  \nThe functions provided by the programming cables correspond with available functions on Lattice programmable \ndevices. Since some devices contain different programming features, the specific functions provided by the \nprogramming cable may depend on the sele cted target device. ispVM System/Diamond /Radiant  Programmer software \nautomatically generate s the appropriate functions based on the selected device.

Programming Software  \nDiamond /Radiant  Programmer and ispVM System for Classic devices is the preferred programming management \nsoftwar e tool for all Lattice devices and download cables. The latest version of Lattice Diamond /Radiant  Programmer or \nispVM System software is available for download from the Lattice web site at www.latticesemi .com/programmer . \n5. Target Board Design Considerations  \nA 4.7  kΩ pull-down resistor is recommended on the TCK connection of the target board. This pull -down is \nrecommended to avoid inadvertent clocking of the TAP controller induced by fast clock edges or as VCC ramps up. This \npull-down is recommended for all Lattice programmable families.  \nThe I2C signals SCL and SDA are open drain. A 2.2  kΩ pull-up resistor to VCC is required on the target board.  Only VCC \nvalues of 3.3 V and 2.5 V for I2C are supported by the HW -USBN -2B cables.  \nFor Lattice device families that feature low power, it is recommended to add a 500 Ω resistor between VCCJ and GND \nduring the programming interval when a USB programming cable is connected to a very low power board design. A \nFAQ is available that discusses this in more depth at: \nhttp://www.latticesemi.com/en/Support/AnswerDatabase/2 /2/0/2205  \nThe JTAG programming port speed may need to be governed when using the programming cables connected to \ncustomer PCBs. This is especially important when there is long PCB routing or with many daisy -chained devic es. The \nLattice programming software can adjust the timing of TCK applied to the JTAG programming port from the cable. This \nlow-precision port setting of TCK depends on many factors, including the PC speed and the type of cable used (parallel \nport, USB or USB2). This software feature provides an option to slow the TCK for debug or noisy environments. A FAQ is \navailable that discusses this in more depth at: http://www.lattices emi.com/en/Support/AnswerDatabase/9/7/974.aspx  \nThe USB download cable can be used to program Power Manager or ispClock products with Lattice programming \nsoftware. When using the USB cable with the Power Manager I devices,  (POWR604, POWR1208, POWR1208P1), user  \nmust slow do TCK by a factor of 2.

For older Lattice ISP devices, a 0.01 μF decoupling capacitor is required on ispEN/ENABLE of the target board.  \n2. For HW -USBN -2A/2B, the target board supplies the power - Typical ICC = 10 mA. For devices that have a VCCJ pin, the VCCJ must be connected to the cable’s VCC.  For other \ndevices , connect the appropriate bank VCCIO to the cable\'s VCC. A 0.1 μF decoupling capacitor is required on VCCJ or VCCIO close  to the device. Please refer to the device data \nsheet to determine if the device has a VCCJ pin or what VCCIO bank governs the target programming port (this may not be the same as a target device’s core VCC/VSS p lane).  \n3. Open drain signals. Target board should have ~2.2 k Ω pull-up resistor connected to the same plane to which VCC is connected . HW -USBN -2B cables provide internal 3.3 k Ω pull-\nups to VCC . \n4. When using PAC -Designer® software to program ispPAC or ispClock devices, do not connect TRST/DONE.  \n5. If using a cable older tha n HW -USBN -2B, connect a +5 V external supply between iCEprogM1050 pin 4 (VCC) and pin 2 (GND).  \n6. For HW -USBN -2B, only VCC values of 3.3 V thru  2.5 V are supported for I2C. \n \nProgramming Cables   \nUser Guide  \n© 2009 -2023  Lattice Semiconductor Corp.

Connecting the Programming Cable  \nThe target board must be un powered when connecting, disconnecting, or reconnecting the programming cable. Always \nconnect the programming cable’s GND pin (black wire) before connecting any other JTAG pins. Failure to follow these \nprocedures can result in damage to the target programm able device.  \n8. Programming Cable TRST Pin  \nConnecting the board TRST pin to the cable TRST pin is not recommended. Instead, connect the board TRST pin to Vcc. \nIf the board TRST pin is connected to the cable TRST pin, instruct ispVM/Diamond /Radiant  Programmer to drive the \nTRST pin high . \nTo configure ispVM/Diamond /Radiant  Programmer to drive TRST pin high : \n1. Select the Options  menu item.  \n2. Select Cable and I/O Port Setup . \n3. Select  the TRST/Reset Pin Connected  checkbox.  \n4. Select the Set High  radio button.  \nIf the proper o ption is not selected, the TRST pin is driven low by ispVM/Diamond /Radiant  Programmer. Consequently, \nthe BSCAN chain does  not work because the chain is locked into RESET state.  \n9. Programming Cable ispEN Pin  \nThe following pins should be grounded:  \n• BSCAN pin of the 2000VE devices  \n• ENABLE pin of MACH4A3/5 -128/64, MACH4A3/5 -64/64 and MACH4A3/5 -256/128 devices.  \nHowever, user  have  the option of having the BSCAN and ENABLE pins driven by the ispEN pin from the cable. In this \ncase, ispVM/Diamond /Radiant  Programmer mu st be configured to drive the ispEN pin low as follows:  \nTo configure ispVM/Diamond /Radiant  Programmer to drive ispEN pin low : \n1. Select the Options  menu item.  \n2. Select Cable and I/O Port Setup . \n3. Select  the ispEN/BSCAN Pin Connected  checkbox.  \n4. Select the Set Low  radio button.  \nEach programming cable ships with two small connectors that help to keep the flywires organized. The following \nmanufacturer and part number is one possible source for equivalent connectors:  \n• 1 x 8 Connector ( for example,  Sam tec SSQ -108-02-T-S) \n• 2 x 5 Connector ( for example,  Samtec SSQ -105-02-T-D) \nThe programming cable flywire or headers are intended to connect to standard 100 -mil spacing headers (pins spaced \n0.100 inch apart). Lattice recommends a header with length of 0.243 i nches or 6.17 mm. Though, headers of other \nlengths may work equally well.  \nProgramming Cables   \nUser Guide  \n© 2009 -2023  Lattice Semiconductor Corp.
