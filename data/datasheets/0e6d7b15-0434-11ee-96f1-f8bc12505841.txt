Repea tability in relation to time follows \nthe square root law. For example, to obtain offset repeatability of the x-axis for 2.5 years, use the following equation: ±2 m g × √(2.5 years/10 years) = ±1 m g. \n3 The temperature change  is −40°C to +25°C, or +25°C to +125°C. \n4 The VRE measurement is the shift in dc offset while the device is subject to 2.5 g rms of random vibration from 50 Hz to 2 kHz. The device under test (DUT) is \nconfigured for the ±2 g range and an output data rate of 4 kHz. The VRE scales with the range setting. \n5 Based on characterization.  \n6 The noise spectral density for ±8 g range is estimated by design to be 50% more than that of the ±2 g range.  \n7 Overall transfer function includes the sensor mechanical response and all other filters on the signal chain.  \n8 The self test result converted to the acceleration value is independent of the selected range. \n9 When V 1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG  are generated internally, V SUPPLY  is valid. To disable the LDO regulator and drive V 1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG  externally, connect V SUPPLY  to V SS. \n10 Standby to measurement mode.

B | Page 21 of 42 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADXL354 is a complete 3-axis, ultralow noise and ultrastable \noffset microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer with outputs ratiometric to the analog 1.8 V supply, V\n1P8ANA . The \nADXL355 adds three high resolution analog-to-digital \nconverters (ADCs) that use the analog 1.8 V supply as a \nreference to provide digital outputs insensitive to the supply voltage. The ADXL354B is pin selectable for ±2 g or ±4 g full \nscale, the ADXL354C is pin selectable for ±2 g or ±8 g full scale, \nand the ADXL355 is programmable for ±2 g, ±4 g, or ±8 g full \nscale. The ADXL355 offers both SPI and I\n2C communications \nports. \nThe micromachined, sensing elements are fully differential, \ncomprising the lateral x-axis and y-axis sensors and the vertical, \nteeter totter z-axis sensors. The x-axis and y-axis sensors and the z-axis sensors go through separate signal paths that minimize offset drift and noise. The signal path is fully differential, except \nfor a differential to single-ended conversion at the analog outputs of the ADXL354. \nThe analog accelerometer outputs of the ADXL354 are ratiometric \nto V\n1P8ANA . Therefore, digitize them carefully. The temperature \nsensor output is not ratiometric. The X OUT, Y OUT, and Z OUT analog \noutputs are filtered internally with an antialiasing filter. These \nanalog outputs also have an internal 32 kΩ series resistor that can be used with an external capacitor to set the bandwidth of the output.  \nThe ADXL355 includes antialias filters before and after the high \nresolution Σ-Δ ADC. User-selectable output data rates and filter corners are provided. The temperature sensor is digitized with a \n12-bit successive approximation register (SAR) ADC. \n \nADXL354 /ADXL355  Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 22 of 42 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nANALOG OUTPUT \nFigure 58 shows the ADXL354 application circuit. The analog \noutputs (X OUT, Y OUT, and Z OUT) are ratiometric to the 1.8 V \nanalog voltage from the V 1P8ANA  pin. V 1P8ANA  can be powered \nwith an on-chip LDO regulator that is powered from V SUPPLY . \nV1P8ANA  can also be supplied externally by forcing V SUPPLY  to V SS, \nwhich disables the LDO regulator. Due to the ratiometric response, the analog output requires referencing to the V\n1P8ANA  \nsupply when digitizing to achieve the inherent noise and offset \nperformance of the ADXL354. The 0 g bias output is nominally \nequal to V 1P8ANA /2. The recommended option is to use the \nADXL354 with a ratiometric ADC (for example, the Analog Devices, Inc., AD7682 ) and V\n1P8ANA  providing the voltage \nreference. This configuration results in self cancellation of \nerrors due to minor supply variations.  \nThe ADXL354 outputs two forms of filtering: internal anti-\naliasing filtering with a cutoff frequency of approximately 1.5 kHz, \nand external filtering. The external filter uses a fixed, on-chip, 32 kΩ resistance in series with each output in conjunction with the external capacitors to implement the low-pass filter antialiasing and noise reduction prior to the external ADC. The antialias \nfilter cutoff frequency must be significantly higher than the desired signal bandwidth. If the antialias filter corner is too low, ratiometricity can degrade where the signal attenuation is \ndifferent from the reference attenuation.  \nDIGITAL OUTPUT \nFigure 59 shows the ADXL355 application circuit with the \nrecommended bypass capacitors. The communications interface is either SPI or I\n2C (see the Serial Communications section for \nadditional information).  \nThe ADXL355 includes an internal configurable digital band-\npass filter. Both the high-pass and low-pass poles of the filter are adjustable, as detailed in the Filter Settings Register section and Table 44. At power-up, the default conditions for the filters \nare as follows: \n\uf0b7 High-pass filter (HPF) = dc (off)  \n\uf0b7 Low-pass filter (LPF) = 1000 Hz \n\uf0b7 Output data rate = 4000 Hz \nADXL354VSUPPLYVDDIO (±4g, ±8g)\nGND ( ± 2 g)\nVDDIO (MEASUREMENT)\nGND (STANDBY)V1P8ANA\nVSS\nV1P8DIGADC V REFRANGE\nST1\nST2\nTEMP11\n10\n9ZOUT\nYOUT\nXOUT14\n13\n12\n81\n2\n3\nVDDIO\nVSSIO\nSTBY5\n6\n742.25VTO 3.6V\n1µF 0.1µF\n1µF 0.1µF\n1µF\n0.1µF1µF\n0.1µF2.25VTO 3.6V\n14205-022 \nFigure 58.

Note that \nthe output voltage increases when accelerated along the sensitive axis.  \nYZ\nX\n14205-005 \nFigure 60. Axes of Acceleration Sensitivity \nPOWER SEQUENCING \nThere are two methods for applying power to the device. \nTypically, internal LDO regulators generate the 1.8 V power for the analog and digital supplies, V\n1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG , respectively. \nOptionally, the internal LDO regulators can be disabled and V\n1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG  are driven by external 1.8 V supplies. \nWhen using the internal LDO regulators, connect V SUPPLY  to a \nvoltage source between 2.25 V and 3.6 V . In this case, the \nrecommended power sequence is to apply power to V DDIO, \nfollowed by applying power to V SUPPLY  approximately 10 μs later. \nIf necessary, V SUPPLY  and V DDIO can be powered from the same \nvoltage source, so that both are powered at the same time. However, V\nSUPPLY  cannot be powered before V DDIO. \nTo disable the internal LDO regulators, tie V SUPPLY  to ground and \nuse external 1.8 V supplies to power V 1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG . V 1P8ANA  \nand V 1P8DIG  must have the same voltage level. The maximum \nacceptable tolerance between the external V 1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG  \nvoltage levels is 50 mV . In the case of bypassing the LDO regulators, the recommended power sequence is to apply power to V\nDDIO, \nfollowed by applying power to V 1P8DIG  approximately 10 μs later, \nand then applying power to V 1P8ANA  approximately 10 μs later. If \nnecessary, V 1P8DIG  and V DDIO can be powered from the same \nexternal 1.8 V supply, which can also be tied to V 1P8ANA  with \nproper isolation, so that all are powered at the same time. In this case, proper decoupling and low frequency isolation are important to maintain the noise performance of the sensor. \nPOWER SUPPLY DESCRIPTION \nThe ADXL354/ADXL355 have four different power supply domains: V\nSUPPLY , V 1P8ANA , V 1P8DIG , and V DDIO. The internal \nanalog and digital circuitry operates at 1.8 V nominal.  \nVSUPPLY  \nVSUPPLY  is 2.25 V to 3.6 V , which is the input range to the two \nLDO regulators that generate the nominal 1.8 V outputs for V\n1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG . Connect V SUPPLY  to V SS to disable the LDO \nregulators, which allows driving V 1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG  from an \nexternal source. V1P8ANA  \nAll sensor and analog signal processing circuitry operates in this domain. Offset and sensitivity of the analog output \nADXL354 are ratiometric to this supply voltage. When using \nexternal ADCs, use V\n1P8ANA  as the reference voltage The \nADXL354 includes ADCs that are ratiometric to V 1P8ANA , \nthereby rendering the offset and sensitivity of the digital output ADXL354 insensitive to the value of V\n1P8ANA . V 1P8ANA  can be an \ninput or an output as defined by the state of the V SUPPLY  voltage.  \nV1P8DIG  \nV1P8DIG  is the supply voltage for the internal logic circuitry. A \nseparate LDO regulator decouples the digital supply noise from the analog signal path. V\n1P8ANA  can be an input or an output as \ndefined by the state of the V SUPPLY  voltage. If driven externally, \nV1P8DIG  must be the same voltage as the V 1P8ANA  voltage.  \nVDDIO  \nThe V DDIO value determines the logic high levels. On the analog \noutput ADXL354, V DDIO sets the logic high level for the self test \npins, ST1 and ST2, as well as the STBY  pin. On the digital output \nADXL355, V DDIO sets the logic high level for communications \ninterface ports, as well as the interrupt and DRDY outputs. \nThe LDO regulators are operational when V SUPPLY  is between \n2.25 V and 3.6 V . V 1P8ANA  and V 1P8DIG  are the regulator outputs in \nthis mode. Alternatively, when tying V SUPPLY  to V SS, V 1P8ANA  and \nV1P8DIG  are supply voltage inputs with a 1.62 V to 1.98 V range. \nOVERRANGE PROTECTION  \nThe maximum nominal measurement range for the ADXL354/ ADXL355 is ±8 g. Do not subject the device to (or use the device \nin) applications or assembly processes that reasonably expect to \nexceed this level of acceleration, particularly for long durations \nor on an ongoing basis. In such applications, the ADXL356 / \nADXL357  offer higher g ranges that may be better suited for \nsuch applications. \nTo avoid electrostatic capture of the proof mass when the \naccelerometer is subject to input acceleration beyond its full-\nscale range, all sensor drive clocks turn off for 0.5 ms. In the ±2 g \nrange setting, the overrange protection activates for input signals \nbeyond approximately ±8 g (±25%), and for the ±4 g and ±8 g \nrange settings, the threshold corresponds to about ±16 g (±25%).  \nWhen overrange protection occurs, the X\nOUT, Y OUT, and Z OUT pins \non the ADXL354 begin to drive to midscale, whereas the ADXL355 floats toward zero, and the first in, first out (FIFO) \nbuffer begins filling with this data. \nSELF TEST \nThe ADXL354 and ADXL355 incorporate a self test feature \nthat effectively tests their mechanical and electronic systems simultaneously. Enabling self test stimulates the sensor electrostatically to produce an output corresponding to the test signal applied as well as the mechanical force exerted.  \nADXL354 /ADXL355  Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 24 of 42 In the ADXL354, drive the ST1 pin to V DDIO to invoke self test \nmode. Then, by driving the ST2 pin to V DDIO, the ADXL354 \napplies an electrostatic force to the mechanical sensor and induces a change in output in response to the force. The self test \ndelta (or response) is the difference in output voltages between \nwhen ST2 is high vs. ST2 is low, while ST1 is asserted. After the self test measurement is complete, bring both pins low to resume normal operation. \nThe self test operation is similar in the ADXL355, except ST1 \nand ST2 can be accessed through the SELF_TEST register (Register 0x2E). \nThe self test feature rejects externally applied acceleration and \nonly responds to the self test force, which allows an accurate \nmeasurement of the self test, even in the presence of external \nmechanical noise. When the self test feature is not used, both ST1 and ST2 must be kept low.  \nFILTER \nThe ADXL354/ADXL355 use an analog, low-pass, antialiasing filter to reduce out of band noise and to limit bandwidth. The ADXL355 provides further digital filtering options to maintain optimal noise performance at various ODRs. \nThe analog, low-pass antialiasing filter in the ADXL354/ADXL355 \nprovides a fixed 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 1.5 kHz, the \nfrequency at which the voltage output response is attenuated by \napproximately 30%. The shape of the filter response in the fre-quency domain is that of a sinc filter. While the analog antialiasing filter attenuates the output response around and above its cutoff frequency, the MEMS sensor has a resonance at 2.4 kHz and \nmechanically amplifies the output response at around 1 kHz and \nabove. These competing trends are apparent in the overall transfer function of the ADXL354, as shown in Figure 8 to Figure 10. Therefore, the overall 3 dB bandwidth of the ADXL354 is 1.9 kHz. \nThe ADXL354 x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis analog outputs include \nan amplifier followed by a series 32 kΩ resistor and output to the X\nOUT, the Y OUT, and the Z OUT pins, respectively.  \nThe ADXL355 provides an internal 20-bit, Σ-Δ ADC to digitize \nthe filtered analog signal. Additional digital filtering (beyond the \nanalog, low-pass, antialiasing filter) consists of a low-pass digital \ndecimation filter and a bypassable high-pass filter that supports output data rates between 4 kHz and 3.9 Hz. The decimation filter consists of two stages. The first stage is fixed decimation with a 4 kHz ODR and a low-pass filter cutoff (3 dB) at about \n1 kHz. A variable second stage decimation filter is used for the \n2 kHz output data rate and below (it is bypassed for 4 kHz ODR). Figure 61 shows the low-pass filter response with a 1 kHz corner (4 kHz ODR) for the ADXL355. Note that Figure 61 does not include the fixed frequency analog, low-pass, antialiasing filter with a fixed 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 1.5 kHz. \nThe ADXL355 pass band of the signal path relates to the combined \nfilter responses, including the analog filter previously described, \nand the digital decimation filter/ODR setting. Table 10 shows the delay associated with the decimation filter for each setting and \nprovides the attenuation at the ODR/4 corner. \n14205-023–70–60–50–40–30–20–100\n1 10 100 10k 1kDIGITAL LPF RESPONSE (dB)\nINPUT FREQUENCY (Hz) \nFigure 61.

The high-pass corner frequency, where the output is attenuated by 50%, is related to the ODR, and the HPF_CORNER setting in the filter register (Register 0x28, Bits[6:4]).

B | Page 27 of 42 I2C PROTOCOL \nThe ADXL355 supports point to point I2C communication. \nHowever, when sharing an SDA bus, the ADXL355 may prevent communication with other devices on that bus. If at any point, even when the ADXL355 is not being addressed, the 0x3A and \n0x3B bytes (when the ADXL355 device address is set to 0x1D), \nor the 0xA6 and 0xA7 bytes (when the ADXL355 device address is set to 0x53) are transmitted on the SDA bus, the ADXL355 responds with an acknowledge bit and pulls the SDA line down. For example, this response can occur when reading or writing the data bytes (0x3A/0x3B or 0xA6/0xA7) to another sensor on \nthe bus. When the ADXL355 pulls the SDA line down, \ncommunication with other devices on the bus may be interrupted. To resolve this interruption, the ADXL355 must be \nconnected to a separate SDA bus, or the CS\n/SCL pin must be \nswitched high when communication with the ADXL355 is not \ndesired (it is normally grounded). \nThe ADXL355 supports standard (100 kHz), fast (up to 1 MHz) \nand high speed (up to 3.4 MHz) data transfer modes when the bus parameters in Table 4 are met. There is no minimum SCL \nfrequency, with the exception that, when reading data, the clock \nmust be fast enough to read an entire sample set before new data overwrites it. Single-byte or multiple byte reads/writes are supported. With the MISO/ASEL pin low, the I\n2C address for \nthe device is 0x1D and an alternate I2C address of 0x53 can be \nchosen by pulling the MISO/ASEL pin high.  \nThere are no internal pull-up or pull-down resistors for any \nunused pins. Therefore, there is no known state or default state \nfor the pins if left floating or unconnected. It is required that SCLK/V\nSSIO be connected to ground when communicating to \nthe ADXL355 using I2C. \nDue to communication speed limitations, the maximum output \ndata rate when using the 400 kHz I2C mode is 800 Hz, and it \nscales linearly with a change in the I2C communication speed. \nFor example, using I2C at 100 kHz limits the maximum ODR to \n200 Hz. Operation at an output data rate above the recommended maximum may result in an undesirable effect on the acceleration \ndata, including missing samples or additional noise. \nFigure 70 to Figure 72 detail the I2C protocol timing. The I2C \ninterface can be used on most buses operating in I2C standard \nmode (100 kHz), fast mode (400 kHz), fast mode plus (1 MHz), and high speed mode (3.4 MHz). The ADXL355 I\n2C device ID \nis as follows: \n\uf0b7 MISO/ASEL pin = 0, device address = 0x1D  \n\uf0b7 MISO/ASEL pin = 1, device address = 0x53  \nREADING ACCELERATION OR TEMPERATURE \nDATA FROM THE INTERFACE \nAcceleration data is left justified and has a register address \norder of most significant data to least significant data, which allows the user to use multibyte transfers and to take only as \nmuch data as required—8 bits, 16 bits, or 20 bits, plus the \nmarker. Temperature data is 12 bits unsigned, right justified. The ADXL355 temperature value is split over two bytes, but is not double buffered, meaning the value can update between readings of the two registers. The data in XDATA, YDATA, and \nZDATA is always the most recent available. It is not guaranteed \nthat XDATA, YDATA, and ZDATA form a set corresponding to one sample point in time. The routine used to retrieve the data from the device controls this data set continuity. If data transfers are initiated when the DATA_RDY bit goes high and \ncompletes in a time approximately equal to 1/ODR, XDATA, \nYDATA, and ZDATA apply to the same data set. \nFor multibyte read or write transactions through either serial \ninterface, the internal register address auto-increments. When the top of the register address range, 0x3FF, is reached, the auto-increment stops and does not wrap back to Address 0x00. \nThe address auto-increment function disables when the FIFO \naddress is used, so that data can be read continuously from the FIFO as a multibyte transaction. In cases where the starting \naddress of a multibyte transaction is less than the FIFO address, \nthe address auto-increments until reaching the FIFO address, and then stops at the FIFO address. \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 28 29 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 123456789\nA60 A 5A 4A 3A 2A 1A 0 D60 D 5D 4D 3D 2D 1D 0A K AK AK A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 RW RWSCL\nSTARTREPEAT\nSTART DEVICE ADDRESS\nSINGLE BYTE READREGISTER ADDRESS DEVICE ADDRESS DATA BYTE STOP\nSDA AK\nINDICATE SDA IS\nCONTROLLED BY ADXL355\n14205-031 \nFigure 70.

That is, when the FIFO \noverruns, new data overwrites the oldest data in the FIFO. A read from the FIFO address guarantees that the three bytes associated with the acceleration measurement on an axis all \npertain to the same measurement. The FIFO never overflows, \nand the data is always taken out in sets (multiples of three data points). \nThere are 96 21-bit locations in the FIFO. Each location \ncontains 20 bits of data and a marker bit for the x-axis data. A single-byte read from the FIFO address pops one location from the FIFO. A multibyte read to the FIFO location pops the FIFO \non the read of the first byte and every third byte read thereafter. \nFigure 73 shows the organization of the data in the FIFO. The \nacceleration data is twos complement, 20-bit data. The FIFO control logic inserts the two virtual bits (0b00) between the data \nbits and the empty indicator bit. Bit 1 indicates that an attempt was made to read an empty FIFO, and that the data is not valid acceleration data. Bit 0 is a marker bit to identify the x-axis, \nwhich allows a user to verify that the FIFO data was correctly \nread. An acceleration data point for a given axis occupies one FIFO location. The read pointer, RD_PTR, points to the oldest stored data that was not read already from the interface (see Figure 73). There are no physical x-acceleration, y-acceleration, or \nz-acceleration data registers. The data read from data registers \n(Register 0x08 to Register 0x10) also comes directly from the most recent data set in the FIFO, which is pointed to by the z pointer, Z_PTR, (see Figure 73).  \n \n0Z17 Z 1 6Z 1 5Z 1 4Z 1 3Z 1 2 Z 1 1Z 1 0 Z9 Z8 Z7 Z6 Z5 Z4 Z3 Z2 Z1 Z0\nY3 Y2 Y1 Y00\nDATA SET.

FIFO Data Organization \n \nData Sheet ADXL354 /ADXL355\n \nRev. B | Page 29 of 42 INTERRUPTS \nThe status register (Register 0x04) contains five individual bits, \nfour of which can be mapped to the INT1 pin, the INT2 pin, or both. The polarity of the interrupt, active high or active low, is also selectable via the INT_POL bit in the range (Register 0x2C) \nregister. In general, the status register clears when read, but this \nis not the case if the condition that caused the interrupt persists after the read of the register. The definition of persist varies slightly in each case, but it is described in the DATA_RDY , DRDY Pin, FIFO_FULL, FIFO_OVR, and Activity sections. \nThe DRDY pin is similar to an interrupt pins (INTx) but clears \ndifferently. This case is also described. \nDATA_RDY \nThe DATA_RDY bit is set when new acceleration data is available to the interface and clears on a read of the status register. This bit is not set again until acceleration data that is newer than the status register read is available. \nSpecial logic on the clearing of the DATA_RDY bit covers the \ncorner case where new data arrives during the read of the status register. In this case, the data ready condition may be missed completely. This logic results in a delay of the clearing of \nDATA_RDY of up to four 512 kHz cycles. \nDRDY PIN \nThe DRDY pin is not a status register bit. DRDY instead \nbehaves similar to an unmaskable interrupt. DRDY is set when new acceleration data is available to the interface. DRDY clears on a read of the FIFO, on a read of XDATA, YDATA, or ZDATA, or by an autoclear function that occurs approximately halfway between output acceleration data sets. \nDRDY is always active high. The INT_POL bit does not affect \nDRDY. In external synchronization modes (EXT_SYNC = 01, \nEXT_SYNC = 10), the first few DRDY pulses after initial \nsynchronization can be lost or corrupted. The length of this potential corruption is equal to or less than the group delay. Therefore, the samples within one group delay is lost or corrupted after the first synchronization signal. Depending on the \ndecimation setting and interpolation setting (see Table 12), \nbetween one and three samples after the first synchronization pulse is lost, provided that all the restrictions set in the External Synchronization and Interpolation section is met.  \nFIFO_FULL \nThe FIFO_FULL bit is set when the entries in the FIFO are equal to the setting of the FIFO_SAMPLES bits. FIFO_FULL clears as follows: \n\uf0b7 If the number of entries in the FIFO is less than the \nnumber of samples indicated by the FIFO_SAMPLES bits, \nwhich is only the case if sufficient data is read from the \nFIFO. \n\uf0b7 On a read of the status register, but only when the entries \nin the FIFO are less than the FIFO_SAMPLES bits.  FIFO_OVR \nThe FIFO_OVR bit is set when the FIFO is so far overrange that data is lost. The specified size of the FIFO is 96 locations. The FIFO_OVR bit is set only when there is an attempt to write past this 96-location limit. \nA read of the status register clears FIFO_OVR. FIFO_OVR is \nnot set again until data is lost subsequent to this status register \nread. \nACTIVITY \nThe activity bit (Register 0x04, Bit 3) is set when the measured \nacceleration on any axis is above the value set in the ACT_ THRESH bits for ACT_COUNT consecutive measurements. An overthreshold condition can shift from one axis to another on successive measurements and is still counted toward the consecutive ACT_COUNT count. \nA read of the status register clears the activity bit (Register 0x04, \nBit 3), but the bit sets again at the end of the next measurement if \nthe activity bit (Register 0x04, Bit 3) conditions are still satisfied.  \nNVM_BUSY \nThe NVM_BUSY bit indicates that the nonvolatile memory \n(NVM) controller is busy and, therefore, the NVM cannot be accessed to read or write. The interrupt functionality requires the NVM_BUSY bit to be cleared to function. \nA status register read that occurs after the NVM controller is no \nlonger busy clears NVM_BUSY .  \nEXTERNAL SYNCHRONIZATION AND \nINTERPOLATION \nThere are four possible synchronization options for the ADXL355, \nthree of which are shown in Figure 74 to Figure 76. For clarity, the clock frequencies and delays are drawn to scale. The labels in \nFigure 74 to Figure 76 are defined as follows: \n\uf0b7 Internal ODR is the alignment of the decimated output \ndata based on the internal clock. \n\uf0b7 ADC modulator clock shows the internal master clock rate. \n\uf0b7 DRDY is an output indicator signaling a sample is ready. \nThe four possible synchronization options are as follows: \n\uf0b7 No external synchronization (internal clocks used) \n\uf0b7 Synchronization with an external synchronization signal \nand internal clock, interpolation filter enabled  \n\uf0b7 Synchronization with external synchronization and clock \nsignals, no interpolation filter \n\uf0b7 Synchronization with external synchronization and clock \nsignals, interpolation filter enabled \n \nADXL354 /ADXL355  Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 30 of 42 EXT_SYNC = 00, EXT_CLK = 0—No External \nSynchronization or Interpolation \nThis is the default mode of operation for the device. The sensor \nruns on an internal ODR and an internal clock that is generated by \nan internal oscillator. The internal ODR serves as the synchroniza-\ntion master, which generates the data. Register 0x28 is used to program the ODR. No external signals are required, and this mode is used typically when the external processor retrieves data from the device asynchronously and absolute synchronization to an external source is not required.  \nThe device outputs DRDY (active high) to signal that a new \nsample is available, and data is retrieved from the real-time \nregisters or the FIFO. The group delay is based on the \ndecimation setting, as shown in Table 10. This mode is shown in Figure 74. \nEXT_SYNC = 10, EXT_CLK = 0—External Synchronization \nwith Interpolation \nSynchronization using interpolation filters and an external ODR \nclock is commonly used when the external processor can \nprovide a synchronization signal that is asynchronous to the \ninternal clock, SYNC, at the desired ODR. In this case, an interpolation filter provides additional time resolution of 64 times the programmed ODR (see Table 12). Synchronization with the interpolation filter enabled (EXT_SYNC = 10) allows \nthe sensor to operate on an internal clock and output data most \nclosely associated with the SYNC rising edge.  \nThe advantage of this mode is that data is available at an arbitrary \nuser defined SYNC sample rate and is asynchronous to the internal clock oscillator. The maximum sample rate cannot exceed 4000 SPS. The disadvantage of this mode is that the group delay is increased, with increased attenuation at the band edge. \nAdditionally, because there is a limit to the time resolution, \nthere is some distortion related to the mismatch of the external synchronization relative to the internal clock oscillator. This mismatch degrades spectral performance. The group delay is based on the decimation setting and interpolation setting (see \nTable 12). Figure 75 schematically shows the timings in this \nmode, and Table 13 shows the delay between the SYNC signal (input) and DRDY (output).  \nTable 13.

If configured in this mode and an external clock is not supplied, the device does not process any data and reading from the output results in null values. This mode is schematically shown in Figure 76. \nSpecial restrictions when using this mode include the following: \n\uf0b7 The external clock frequency on INT2 (Pin 13, see Table 14) \nmust be 1.024 MHz. \n\uf0b7 The pulse width of the SYNC signal must be at least \n3.91 μs, which represents four cycles of the external clock (4 ÷ 1.024 MHz = ~3.91 μs).  \n\uf0b7 The phase of SYNC must meet an approximate 25 ns setup \ntime to the external clock rising edge. \nWhen using the EXT_SYNC mode and without providing the \nSYNC signal, the device runs on its own internal ODR. Similarly, \nafter external synchronization, the device continues to run synchronized to the last SYNC pulse it received, which means that EXT_SYNC = 01 mode can be used with only a single synchronization pulse. \nFor more information about the lost sample in Figure 76, see \nthe DRDY Pin section. \nEXT_SYNC = 10, EXT_CLK = 1—External Synchronization \nand External Clock, with Interpolation Filter \nThis mode can be used to run the device on an external clock \nand synchronization with an arbitrary sample rate set by the SYNC signal rate. Conditions for external SYNC and external clock signals is the same as EXT_SYNC = 01, EXT_CLK = 1 mode. The interpolation filter provides a frequency resolution \nrelated to the ODR (see Table 12). In this case, the data \nprovided corresponds to the external SYNC signal, which can be greater than the set ODR and less than 4000 SPS, but the output pass band remains the same it was prior to the interpolation filter.  \n     \n \n    \n \nData Sheet ADXL354 /ADXL355\n \nRev.

If the race conditi on occurs, \nsome factory settings in the NVM load incorrectly to shadow registers (the registers from which the internal logic configures t he sensor \nand calculates the output after a power-on or a software reset). The incorrect loading of the NVM affects overall performance o f the \nsensor, such as an incorrect 0 g bias and other performance issues. The incorrect loading of NVM does not occur from a power-on or \nafter a power cycle. To guarantee reliable operation of the sensor after a software reset, the user can access the shadow regis ters after a \npower-on, read and store the values on the host microprocessor, and compare the values read from the same shadow registers afte r a \nsoftware reset. This method guarantees proper operation in all devices and under all conditions. The recommended steps are as f ollows: \n1. Read the shadow registers, Register 0x50 to Register 0x54 (five 8-bit registers) after power-up, but before any software reset.   \n2. Store these values in a host device (for example, a host microprocessor). \n3. After each software reset, read the same five registers. If the values differ, perform a software reset again until they match.   \n \n \nData Sheet ADXL354 /ADXL355\n \nRev.
