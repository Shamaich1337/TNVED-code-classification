They are an ideal choice for \ndriving 1.8 V high performance ADCs with resolutions up to \n14 bits from dc to 70 MHz. The adjustable output common \nmode allows the ADA4930-1 /ADA4930-2  to match the input of \nthe ADC. The internal common-mode feedback loop provides exceptional output balance, suppression of even-order harmonic \ndistortion products, and dc level translation. \nWith the ADA4930-1 /ADA4930-2 , differential gain configurations \nare easily realized with a simple external feedback network of \nfour resistors determining the closed-loop gain of the amplifier. \nThe ADA4930-1 /ADA4930-2  are fabricated using Analog Devices, \nInc., proprietary silicon-germanium (SiGe), complementary \nbipolar process, enabling them to achieve very low levels of \ndistortion with an input voltage noise of only 1.2 nV/√Hz.

Thermal Resistance \nPackage Type θJA Unit \n16-Lead LFCSP (Exposed Pad) 98 °C/W \n24-Lead LFCSP (Exposed Pad) 67  °C/W \nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION \nThe maximum safe power dissipation in the ADA4930-1 / \nADA4930-2  packages is limited by the associated rise in \njunction temperature (T J) on the die. At approximately 150°C, \nwhich is the glass transition temperature, the plastic changes its \nproperties. Even temporarily exceeding this temperature limit \ncan change the stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric performance of the ADA4930-1 /ADA4930-2 . Exceeding a junction temperature of \n150°C for an extended period can result in changes in the silicon devices, potentially causing failure.  The power dissipated in the package (P\nD) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the package due to the load drive. The quiescent power is the voltage between the supply pins (V\nS) times the quiescent current (I S). \nThe power dissipated due to the load drive depends upon the particular application. The power due to load drive is calculated by multiplying the load current by the associated voltage drop across the device. RMS voltages and currents must be used in \nthese calculations. \nAirflow increases heat dissipation, effectively reducing θ\nJA. In \naddition, more metal directly in contact with the package leads/ \nexposed pad from metal traces, through holes, ground, and \npower planes reduces θ JA. \nFigure 4 shows the maximum safe power dissipation vs. the \nambient temperature for the ADA4930-1  single 16-lead LFCSP \n(98°C/W) and the ADA4930-2  dual 24-lead LFCSP (67°C/W) \non a JEDEC standard 4-layer board. \n3.5\n0\n–40 110 90 100MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)\nTEMPERATURE (°C)0.51.01.52.02.53.0\n– 3 0 – 2 0 – 1 00 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0ADA4930-2\nADA4930-1\n09209-004 \nFigure 4.

Circuit Definitions  \nDifferential Voltage  \nDifferential voltage refers to the difference between two  \nnode voltages. For example, the output differential volta ge (or , \nequivalently, output differential -mode voltage) is defined as  \nVOUT, dm  = (V+OUT − V−OUT) \nwhere  V+OUT and V−OUT refer to the voltages at the +OUT and \n−OUT terminals with respect to a common reference.  Common -Mode Voltage  \nCommon -mode voltage refer s to the average of two node voltages.  \nThe output common -mode voltage is defined as  \nVOUT, cm  = (V+OUT + V−OUT)/2 \nBalance  \nOutput balance is a measure of how close the differential signals are to being equal in amplitude and opposite in phase. Output balanc e \nis most easily determined by placing a well -matched resistor \ndivider between the differential voltage nodes and comparing the \nmagnitude of the signal at the divider midpoint with the magnitude  \nof the differential signal (see  Figure 39). By this definition, output \nbalance is the magnitude of the output common -mode voltage \ndivided by the magnitude of the output differential  mode voltage.  \ndm OUTcm OUT\nVV\nError Balance Output\n,,=  \n \n \nData Sheet   ADA4930- 1/ADA4930- 2 \n \nRev. D | Page 17 of 25 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADA4930 -1/ADA4930 -2 differ from conventional op amps \nin that they have  two outputs whose voltages move in opposite \ndire ctio ns and an a dditional input, V OCM. Like an op amp, they  rely \non high open -loop gain and negative feedback to force these \noutputs to the desired voltages. The ADA4930- 1/ADA4930 -2 \nbehave much like standard voltage feedback op amp s and facilitate \nsingle -ended -to-differential conversions,  common -mode level \nshifting, and amplifications of differential signals. Like op amp s, \nthe ADA4930 -1/ADA4930 -2 have high input  impedance and low \noutput impedance. \nTwo feedback loops control the diffe rential and common -mode \noutput voltages. The differential feedback, set with external \nresistors, controls the differential output voltage. The common -\nmode feedback controls the common -mode output voltage. This \narchitecture makes it easy to set the output c ommon -mode level \nto any arbitrary value within the specified limits. The output \ncommon -mode voltage is forced  to be equal to the voltage applied  \nto the V OCM input by the internal  common -mode feedback loop . \nThe internal common -mode feedback loop produces ou tputs \nthat are highly balanced over a wide frequency range without requiring tightly matched external components. This results  \nin differential outputs that are very close to the ideal of being identical in amplitude and are exactly  180° apart  in phase.  \nANALYZING AN APPLICATI ON CIRCUIT  \nThe ADA4930 -1/ADA4930 -2 use high open -loop gain and \nnegative feedback to forc e their  differential and common -mode \noutput voltages to minimize the differential and common -mode \nerror voltages. The differential error voltage is defined as the voltage between the differen tial inputs labeled +IN and −IN \n(see Figure 42). For most purposes, this voltage can be assumed \nto be zero. Similarly, the difference between the actual output \ncommon -mode voltage and the voltage applied to V\nOCM can also \nbe assumed to be zero. Starting from these two assumption s, \nany application circuit can be analyzed.  \nSETTING THE CLOSED -LOOP GAIN  \nThe differential -mode gain of the circuit in Figure 42 is \ndetermined by  \nGF\ndmINdm OUT\nRR\nVV\n=\n,, \nwhere the gain and feedback resistors , RG and RF, on each side \nare equal.  \n \n \n \n \n ESTIMATING THE OUTPUT NOISE VOLTAGE  \nThe differential output noise of the ADA4930- 1/ADA4930 -2 can \nbe estimated using the noise model in Figure 43 . The input -referred  \nnoise voltage density, v nIN, is modeled as differential . The noise \ncurrents, i nIN− and i nIN+, appear between each input and ground.  \nADA4930+\nRF2VnOD\nVnCMVOCMVnINRF1\nRG2RG1VnRF1\nVnRF2VnRG1\nVnRG2inIN+\ninIN–\n09209-050 Figure 43 . Noise Mode l \nSimilar to the case of conventional op amp s, the output noise \nvoltage densities can be estimated by multiplying the input -\nreferred terms at +IN and −IN  by an appropriate output factor . \nThe output voltage due to v nIN is obtained by multiplying v nIN by \nthe noise gain, G N.  \nThe circuit noise gain is  \n()2 1Nβ βG+=2 \nwhere the feedback factors are  \nG1 F1G1\n1R RRβ+=  and \nG2 F2G2\n2R RRβ+= . \nWhen the feedback factors are matched, R F1/R G1 = R F2/R G2,  \nβ1 = β2 = β , and the  noise gain becomes \nGF\nNRR\nβG +== 11. \nThe noise currents are uncorrelated with the same mean -square \nvalue, and each produces  an output voltage that is equal to the \nnoise current multiplied by the associated feedback  resistance.  \nThe noise voltage density at the V OCM pin is v nCM. When the \nfeedback networks have the same feedback factor, as in most \ncases, the output noise due to v nCM is common -mode and the \noutput noise from V OCM is zero.  \nEach of the four resistors contributes (4kTR xx)1/2. The noise \nfrom the feedback resistors appears directly at the output, and the noise from the gain resistors appears at the output multiplied by R\nF/R G. \nThe total differential output noise density, v nOD, is the root- sum-\nsquare of the individual outpu t noise terms. \n∑\n==8\n1i2) (nODi nOD v v  \n \n \nADA4930-1/ADA4930-2 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The amplitudes \nof the signals at each output remain equal and 180° out of phase. The input-to-output differential mode gain varies proportionately \nto the feedback mismatch, but the output balance is unaffected.  \nThe gain from the V\nOCM pin to V O, dm is equal to  \n2(β1 − β2)/(β1 + β2) \nWhen β1 = β2, this term goes to zero and there is no differential \noutput voltage due to the voltage on the V OCM input (including \nnoise). The extreme case occurs when one loop is open and the other has 100% feedback; in this case, the gain from V\nOCM input \nto V O, dm is either +2 or −2, depending on which loop is closed. The \nfeedback loops are nominally matched to within 1% in most applications, and the output noise and offsets due to the V\nOCM \ninput are negligible.  If the loops are intentionally mismatched by a large amount, it is necessary to include the gain term from V\nOCM to V O, dm and \naccount for the extra noise. For example, if β1 = 0.5 and β2 = 0.25, the gain from V\nOCM to V O, dm is 0.67. If the V OCM pin is set to 0.9 V , \na differential offset voltage is present at the output of (0.9 V)(0.67) = 0.6 V . The differential output noise contribution is (5 nV/√Hz)(0.67) = 3.35 nV/√Hz. Both of these results are undesirable in most applications; therefore, it is best to use \nnominally matched feedback factors. \nMismatched feedback networks also result in a degradation of \nthe ability of the circuit to reject input common-mode signals, \nmuch the same as for a four-resistor difference amplifier made \nfrom a conventional op amp.  \nAs a practical summarization of the previous issues, resistors of \n1% tolerance produce a worst-case input CMRR of approximately 40 dB, a worst-case differential-mode output offset of 9 mV due to a 0.9 V V\nOCM input, negligible V OCM noise contribution, and \nno significant degradation in output balance error. \nINPUT COMMON-MODE VOLTAGE RANGE  \nThe input common-mode range at the summing nodes of the ADA4930-1 /ADA4930-2  is specified as 0.3 V to 1.5 V at V\nS = 3.3 V . \nTo avoid nonlinearities, the voltage swing at the +IN and −IN \nterminals must be confined to these ranges. \n \nData Sheet   ADA4930- 1/ADA4930- 2 \n \nRev. D | Page 19 of 25 MINIMUM R G VALUE  \nDue to the wide bandwidth of the ADA4930- 1/ADA4930 -2, the \nvalue of R G must be greater than or equal to 301 Ω at unity gain \nto provide sufficient damping in the amplifier front end. In the  \nterminated case, R G includes the Thevenin resistanc e of the \nsource and load terminations.  \nSETTING THE OUTPUT C OMMON -M ODE V OL TAGE  \nThe V OCM pin of the ADA4930 -1/ADA4930 -2 is biased at  3/10 of \nthe total supply voltage above − VS with a n internal  voltage divider.  \nThe input impedance of  the V OCM pin is 8.4  kΩ. When relying \non the internal bias, the  output common -mode voltage is within \nabout 100  mV of the expected value.  \nIn cases where accurate control of the output common -mode \nlevel is required, it is recommended that an external source or \nresistor divider be used with so urce resistance less than 100 Ω. \nThe output common -mode offset listed in the Specifications  \nsection assumes that the V OCM input is driv en by a low \nimpedance voltage source.   \nIt is also possible to connect the V OCM input to a common -mode \nvoltage (V CM) output of an ADC. However, care must be taken \nto ensure that the output has sufficient drive capability. The \ninput impedance of the V OCM pin is approximately 10 kΩ. If \nmultiple ADA4930 -1/ADA4930 -2 devices share one reference \noutput, it is recommend ed that a buffer be used.  \nCALCULATING THE INPUT IMPEDANCE FOR AN \nAPPLICATION CIRCUIT  \nThe effective input impedance depends on whether the signal \nsource is  single -ended or differen tial. For a balanced differential \ninput signal, as shown in Figure 44, the input impedance (R IN, dm) \nbetween the inputs (+D IN and −D IN) is R IN, dm = 2 × R G. \n+VSADA4930\n+IN\n–INRF\nRF+DIN\n–DINVOCMRG\nRGVOUT, dm\n09209-051 \nFigure 44 .

The common -mode \nvoltage at the amplifier input terminals can be easily determined  by noting that the voltag e at the inverting input is equal to the \nnoninverting output voltage divided down by the voltage divider formed by R\nF2 and R G2. This voltage is present at both input \nterminals due to negative voltage feedback and is in phase with \nthe input signal, thus red ucing the effective voltage across R G1, \npartially bootstrapping it. \nTerminating a Single -Ended Input   \nThis se ction describes  the five steps t hat properly terminate a  \nsingle -ended input to the ADA4930- 1/ADA4930 -2.

D | Page 24 of 25 HIGH PERFORMANCE ADC DRIVING \nThe ADA4930 -1/ADA4930 -2 provide excellen t performan ce  in \n3.3 V single -supply applications.  \nThe circuit shown in Figure 59 is an example of the ADA4930- 1 \ndriving an AD9255 , 14-bit, 80 MSPS ADC that is specified to \noperate with a single 1.8 V supply. The performance of the ADC \nis optimized when it is driven differentially , making the best use of \nthe signal swing available within the 1.8 V supply.  The ADA4930 -1 \nperforms the single -ended -to-differential conversion, common -\nmode level  shifting, and buffering of the driving signal.  \nThe ADA4930 -1 is configured for  a single -ended input to \ndifferential  output  with a gain of 2  V/V. The 84.5 Ω termination \nresistor, in parallel with the single -ended input impedance of \n95.1 Ω, provides a 50  Ω termination for the source. The additional  \n31.6 Ω (95 Ω total) at the inverting input balances the parallel \nimpedance of the 50  Ω source and the termination resistor  that \ndrives the noninverting input.  \nThe V OCM pin is connected to the VCM output of the AD 9255 and \nsets the output common mode of the ADA4930 -1 at 0.9 V.  \nNote that a dc bias must be added to the signal so urce and its \nThevenin equivalent to the gain resistor on the inverting side  \nto ensure that the inputs of the ADA4930 -1 are kept at or above \nthe specified minimum input common -mode v oltage at all times.   \nThe 0.5 V dc bias at the signal source  and the 0.314 V dc bias on \nthe gain resistor at the inverting input set the inputs of the \nADA4930 -1 to ~0.48 V dc. With 1  V p-p ma ximum signal swing \nat the input,  the ADA4930 -1 inputs swing between 0.36  V and \n0.6 V.  \nFor a common -mode voltage of 0.9 V,  e a c h  ADA4930 -1 output \nswings between 0. 401 V and 1. 398 V , providing a 1.994 V p-p \ndifferential output. A third -order, 40 MHz, low -pass filter between the ADA49 30-1 \nand the AD9255  reduces the noise bandwidth of the amplifier \nand isolates the driver outputs from the ADC inputs. \nThe circuit shown in Figure  60 is an example of ½ of an \nADA4930 -2 driving ½ of an AD9640 , a 14 -bit, 80  MSPS  \nADC that is specified to opera te with a single 1.8 V supply.  \nThe performance of the ADC is optimized when it is driven \ndifferentially, making the best use of the signal swing available \nwithin the 1.8 V supply.  The ADA4930 -2 performs the single -\nended -to-differential  conversion, common -mode level shifting, \nand buffering of the driving signal.  \nThe ADA4930 -2 is configured for a single -ended in put to \ndifferential output with a gain of 2 V/V . The 88.5  Ω termination \nresistor, in parallel with the single -ended input impedance of \n114.75 Ω, provides a 50  Ω termination for the source. The \nincreased gain resistance at the inverting input balances the 5 0 Ω \nsource resistance and the termination resistor  that drives the \nnoninverting input.  \nThe V OCM pin is connected to the CML output of the AD9640  and \nsets the output common mode of the ADA4930 -2 at 1 V .  \nThe 739 Ω resistors between each input and the 3.3 V supply \nprovide the necessary dc bias to guarantee compliance with the \ninput common -mode range of the ADA4930- 2.  \nFor a common -mode voltage of 1 V , each ADA4930 -2 output \nswings between 0.501 V and 1.498  V, providing a 1.9 94 V p -p \ndifferential output. \nA third -order, 40 MHz, low -pass filter between the ADA4930 -2 \nand the  AD9640  reduces  the noise bandwidth of the amplifier \nand isolates the driver outputs from the ADC inputs. \n1.8V\nDRVDD AVDD\nVIN–\nVIN+AD9255\nAGND VCMD11 TO\nD090pF 30pF168nH\n168nH33Ω\n33Ω50Ω\nVIN\n1V p-p\n95Ω\n0.314V63.4Ω\nVOCM3.3V\nADA4930-1+\n0.5V84.5Ω\n301Ω301Ω\n09209-157 \nFigure 59.
