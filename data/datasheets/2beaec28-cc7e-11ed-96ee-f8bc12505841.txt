The devices supply 1.1A of output current with a \n310mV typical dropout voltage. Operating quiescent current  \nis 500µA for the adjustable version, reducing to <1µA in \nshutdown. Quiescent current is well controlled; it does not \nrise in dropout as with many other regulators. The LT1965 \nregulators have very low output noise which makes them \nideal for sensitive RF and DSP supply applications.\nOutput voltage ranges from 1.20V to 19.5V. The LT1965 \nregulators are stable with output capacitors as low as \n10µF . Internal protection circuitry includes reverse- battery  \nprotection, current limiting with foldback, thermal limit-\ning and reverse-current protection. The LT1965 series \nare available in fixed output voltages of 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V, \n3.3V, and as an adjustable device with a 1.20V reference \nvoltage.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device \nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Absolute maximum input to output differential voltage is not \nachievable with all combinations of rated IN pin and OUT pin voltages. \nWith the IN pin at 22V, the OUT pin may not be pulled below 0V. The total \nmeasured voltage from IN to OUT must not exceed ±22V.\nNote 3: The LT1965 regulators are tested and specified under pulse \nload conditions such that T\nJ @ T A. The LT1965E regulators are 100% \ntested at T A = 25°C and performance is guaranteed from 0°C to 125°C. \nPerformance of the LT1965E over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range is assured by design, characterization and \ncorrelation with statistical process controls. The LT1965I regulators are \nguaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The LT1965H is tested at 150°C operating junction temperature. High junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes. Operating lifetime \nis derated at junction temperatures greater than 125°C.\nNote 4: The LT1965 adjustable version is tested and specified for \nthese \nconditions with the ADJ connected to the OUT pin. \nNote 5: Maximum junction temperature limits operating conditions. The \nregulated output voltage specification does not apply for all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. Limit the output current range if operating at the maximum input voltage. Limit the input-to-output \nvoltage differential if operating at the maximum output current.Note 6: To  satisfy minimum input voltage requirements, the LT1965 \nadjustable version is tested and specified for these conditions with an \nexternal resistor divider (bottom 4.02k, top 4.32k) for an output voltage of \n2.5V. The external resistor divider adds 300µA of output DC load current. \nThis external current is not factored into GND pin current.\nNote 7: Dropout voltage is the minimum input-to-output voltage \ndifferential needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In \ndropout, the output voltage equals: (V\nIN – V DROPOUT )\nNote 8: GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  + 1V and a \ncurrent source load. GND pin current increases slightly in dropout. For the fixed output versions, an internal resistor divider will typically add \n100µA to the GND pin current. See GND pin current curves in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics \nsection.\nNote 9: ADJ pin bias current flows into the ADJ pin.\nNote 10: SHDN pin current flows into the SHDN pin.\nNote 11: Reverse-output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and \nthe OUT pin forced to the rated output voltage. This current flows into the \nOUT pin and out of the GND pin.\nNote 12: For the LT1965, LT1965-1.5 and LT1965-1.8, the minimum input \nvoltage specification limits the dropout voltage under some output voltage/\nload conditions.\nNote 13: This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions.

4): Output. This pin supplies \npower to the load. Use a minimum output capacitor of \n10µF to prevent oscillations. Large load transient applica -\ntions require larger output capacitors to limit peak voltage \ntransients. See the Applications Information section for \nmore information on output capacitance and reverse- output  \ncharacteristics.\nSENSE (Pin 3 / 3 / 5 / 5): Sense. For fixed voltage versions \nof the LT1965 ( LT1965-1.5/LT1965-1.8/ LT1965-2.5/  \nLT1965-3.3), the SENSE pin is the input to the error am-\nplifier. Optimum regulation is obtained when the SENSE \npin is connected to the OUT pin of the regulator. In criti-\ncal applications, small voltage drops are caused by the \nresistance (R P) of PCB traces between the regulator and \nthe load. These drops may be eliminated by connecting \nthe SENSE pin to the output at the load as shown in Figure \n1 (Kelvin Sense Connection). Note that the voltage drop \nacross the external PCB traces will add to the dropout \nvoltage of the regulator. The SENSE pin bias current is \n100µA at the nominal rated output voltage. ADJ (Pin 3 / 3 / 5 / 5): Adjust. This pin is the input to the \nerror amplifier. It has a typical bias current of 1.3µA that \nflows into \nthe pin. The ADJ pin voltage is 1.20V referenced \nto ground.\nGND (Pins 4, 5 / 4, 5 / 3 / 3): Ground. For the adjustable \nLT1965, connect the bottom of the resistor divider, setting \noutput voltage, directly to GND for optimum regulation.SHDN (Pin 6 / 6 / 1 / 1): Shutdown. Pulling the SHDN pin \nlow puts the LT1965 into a low power state and turns the \noutput off. Drive the SHDN pin with either logic or an open \ncollector/drain with a pull-up resistor. The resistor sup-\nplies the pull-up current to the open collector/drain logic, \nnormally several microamperes and the SHDN pin current, \ntypically less than 5.5µA. If unused, connect the SHDN pin \nto VIN. The SHDN pin cannot be driven below GND unless \nit is tied to the IN pin. If the SHDN pin is driven below \nGND while IN is powered, the output will turn on. SHDN \npin logic cannot be referenced to a negative supply rail.\nIN (Pins 7, 8 / 7, 8 / 2 / 2): Input. This pin supplies power \nto the device. The LT1965 requires a bypass capacitor at \nIN if located more than six inches from the main input filter \ncapacitor. Include a bypass capacitor in battery-powered \ncircuits as a battery’s output impedance generally rises \nwith frequency. A bypass capacitor in the range of 1µF to \n10µF suffices. The LT1965’s design withstands reverse \nvoltages on the IN pin with respect to ground and the \nOUT pin. In the case of a reversed input, which occurs if \na battery is plugged in backwards, the LT1965 behaves \nas if a diode is in series with its input. No reverse current \nflows into the LT1965 and no reverse voltage appears at \nthe load. The device protects itself and the load.Exposed Pad (Pin 9 / 9, DFN and MSOP Packages Only): \nGround. Tie this pin directly to Pins 4 and 5 and the PCB \nground. This pin provides enhanced thermal performance \nwith its connection to the PCB ground. See the Applica\n-\ntions Information section for thermal considerations and \ncalculating junction temperature. (DFN/MSOP/DD-Pak/TO-220)\nFigure 1. Kelvin Sense ConnectionIN\n1965 F01RP\nRPOUT\nVINSENSE SHDN\nGNDLT1965\n+ +LOAD\nLT1965 Series12\n1965fb For more information www.linear .com/L T1965applications inForMation\nThe LT1965 series are 1.1A low dropout regulators with \nshutdown. The devices are capable of supplying 1.1A at \na typical dropout voltage of 310mV. The low operating \nquiescent current (500µA  for the adjustable version, 600µA \nfor the fixed voltage versions) drops to less than 1µA in \nshutdown. In addition to the low quiescent current, the \nLT1965 regulators incorporate several protection features \nthat makes them ideal for use in battery-powered systems. \nThe devices protect themselves against both reverse- input  \nand reverse-output voltages. In battery backup applica -\ntions, if a backup battery holds up the output when the input  \nis pulled to ground, the LT1965 performs like it has a diode \nin series with its output, preventing reverse-current flow.  \nAdjustable Operation\nThe LT1965 adjustable version has an output voltage range  \nof 1.20V to 19.5V. Figure 2 illustrates that the ratio of \ntwo external resistors sets the output voltage. The device \nservos the output to maintain the ADJ pin voltage at 1.20V \nreferenced to ground. R1’s current equals 1.20V/R1. R2’s \ncurrent equals R1’s current plus the ADJ pin bias current. \nThe ADJ pin bias current, 1.3µA at 25°C, flows through \nR2 into the ADJ pin. Use the formula in Figure 2 to calcu -\nlate output voltage. Linear Technology recommends that \nR1’s value be less than 12.1k to minimize output voltage \nerrors due to the ADJ pin bias current. In shutdown, the \noutput turns off and the divider current is zero. For curves \ndepicting ADJ Pin Voltage vs Temperature and ADJ Pin \nBias Current vs Temperature, see the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section.The adjustable device is tested and specified with the ADJ \npin tied to the OUT pin for an output voltage of 1.20V. \nSpecifications for output voltages greater than 1.20V are \nproportional to the ratio of the desired output voltage to 1.20V: V\nOUT/1.20V. For example, load regulation for an \noutput current change of 1mA to 1.1A is typically –4.25mV \nat VOUT = 1.20V. At V OUT = 5V, load regulation is:\n  5V\n1.20V•–4.25mV =–17.71 mV\nOutput CapacitanceThe LT1965’s design is stable with a wide range of out\n-\nput capacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects \nstability, most notably with small capacitors. A minimum \noutput capacitor of 10µF with an ESR of 0.3W or less is \nrecommended to prevent oscillations. The LT1965 is a low \nquiescent current device and output load transient response  \nis a function of output capacitance. Larger values of output \ncapacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide \nimproved transient response for larger current changes.\nCeramic capacitors require extra consideration. Manufac -\nturers make ceramic capacitors with a variety of dielectrics, \neach with different behavior across temperature and applied  \nvoltage. The most common dielectrics used are specified \nwith EIA temperature characteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V, \nX5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics provide high \nC-V products in a small package at low cost, but exhibit \nstrong voltage and temperature coefficients as shown in \nFigures 3 and 4. When used with a 5V regulator, a 16V \n10µF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value as low \nas 1µF to 2µF for the DC bias applied and over the operat -\ning temperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics yield \nmuch more stable characteristics and are more suitable \nfor use as the output capacitor. The X7R type works over \na wider temperature range and has better temperature \nstability whereas X5R is less expensive and is available in \nhigher values. Care still must be exercised when using X5R \nand X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R codes only specify \noperating temperature range and maximum capacitance \nchange over temperature. Capacitance change due to DC \nbias with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than Y5V and \nZ5U capacitors, but can still be significant enough to drop \ncapacitor values below appropriate levels. Capacitor DC \nbias characteristics tend to improve as component case \nsize increases, but expected capacitance at operating \nvoltages should be verified. Figure 2.

Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, \nsimilar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro -\nphone works. For a ceramic capacitor, the stress can be \ninduced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients. \nThe resulting voltages produced can cause appreciable \namounts of noise. A ceramic capacitor produced the trace \nin Figure 5 in response to light tapping from a pencil. \nSimilar vibration induced behavior can masquerade as \nincreased output voltage noise.Overload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the LT1965 has safe oper-\nating area protection. The safe area protection decreases \ncurrent limit as input- to-output voltage increases and keeps  \nthe power transistor inside a safe operating region for all \nvalues of input-to-output voltage. The protective design \nprovides some output current at all values of input-to-\noutput voltage up to the device breakdown.\nWhen power is first applied, as input voltage rises, the \noutput follows the input, allowing the regulator to start up \ninto very heavy loads. During start-up, as the input voltage \nFigure 3. Ceramic Capacitor DC Bias Characteristics Figure 4. Ceramic Capacitor Temperature Characteristics\nFigure 5.

Other regulators, such as the LT1083/LT1084/\nLT1085 family, also exhibit this phenomenon, so it is not \nunique to the LT1965.\nThe problem occurs with a heavy output load when the \ninput voltage is high and the output voltage is low. Com-\nmon situations occur immediately after the removal of a \nshort-circuit or if the shutdown pin is pulled high after the \ninput voltage has already been turned on. The load line for \nsuch a load may intersect the output current curve at two \npoints. If this happens, there are two stable output operat -\ning points for the regulator. With this double intersection, \nthe input power supply may need to be cycled down to \nzero and brought up again to make the output recover.\nOutput Voltage Noise\nThe LT1965 regulators are designed to provide low output \nvoltage noise over the 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth while \noperating at full load. Output voltage noise is approximately  \n80nV/√Hz  over this frequency bandwidth for the LT1965 \nadjustable version. For higher output voltages (generated \nby using a resistor divider), the output voltage noise gains \nup accordingly.Higher values of output voltage noise may be measured \nif care is not exercised with regard to circuit layout and \ntesting. Crosstalk from nearby traces can induce unwanted  \nnoise  onto the LT1965’ s output . Power supply  ripple  rejec\n-\ntion must also be considered; the LT1965 regulators do \nnot have unlimited power supply rejection and will pass \na small portion of the input noise through to the output.applications inForMation\nThermal ConsiderationsThe LT1965’s maximum rated junction temperature of \n125°C (LT1965E, LT1965I) or 150°C (LT1965H) limits \nits power handling capability. Tw o components comprise \nthe power dissipated by the device:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage \ndifferential: I\nOUT • (V IN – VOUT), and\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:  \nIGND • VIN\nGND pin current is determined using the GND Pin Current \ncurves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section. \nPower dissipation equals the sum of the two components \nlisted.\nThe LT1965 regulators have internal thermal limiting that \nprotect the device during overload conditions. For con-\ntinuous normal conditions, do not exceed the maximum \njunction temperature rating of 125°C (E-grade, I-grade) or \n150°C (H-grade). Carefully consider all sources of thermal \nresistance from junction to ambient including other heat \nsources mounted in proximity to the LT1965.\nThe underside of the LT1965 DFN package has exposed \nmetal (4mm2) from the lead frame to the die attachment. \nThe underside of the LT1965 MSOP package also has \nexposed metal (3.7mm2). Both packages allow heat to \ndirectly transfer from the die junction to the printed circuit \nboard metal to control maximum operating junction tem-\nperature. The dual-in-line pin arrangement allows metal \nto extend beyond the ends of the package on the topside \n(component side) of a PCB. Connect this metal to GND \non the PCB. The multiple IN and OUT pins of the LT1965 \nalso assist in spreading heat to the PCB.For surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board \nand its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated \nthrough-holes can also be used to spread the heat gener\n-\nated by power devices.\nLT1965 Series15\n1965fb For more information www.linear .com/L T1965applications inForMation\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several \ndifferent board sizes and copper areas.

So the junction temperature rise above ambient \napproximately equals: 0.511W • 65°C/W = 33.22°C\nThe maximum junction temperature equals the maximum \nambient temperature plus the maximum junction tempera\n-\nture rise above ambient or: T\nJMAX = 85°C + 33.22°C = 118.22°C\nProtection Features\nThe LT1965 regulators incorporate several protection \nfeatures that makes them ideal for use in battery-powered \ncircuits. In addition to the normal protection features \nassociated with monolithic regulators, such as current \nlimiting and thermal limiting, the devices also protect \nagainst reverse-input voltages, reverse-output voltages \nand reverse output-to-input voltages.\nCurrent-limit protection and thermal overload protection \nprotect the device against current overload conditions \nat its output. For normal operation, do not exceed the \nmaximum rated junction temperature of 125°C (LT1965E, \nLT1965I) or 150°C (LT1965H).\nLT1965 Series16\n1965fb For more information www.linear .com/L T1965The input  of the device  withstands  reverse  voltages  of 22V. \nThe LT1965 limits current flow to less than 1mA (typically \nless than 300µA) and no negative voltage appears at the \noutput. The device protects both itself and the load against \nbatteries that are plugged in backwards.\nThe LT1965 incurs no damage if its output is pulled be-\nlow ground. If the input is left open-circuit or grounded, \nthe output can be pulled below ground by 22V. For fixed \nvoltage versions, the output will act like a large resistor, \ntypically 5k or higher, limiting current flow to typically \nless than 300µA. For the adjustable version, the output \nacts like an open circuit and no current flows from the \noutput. However, current flows out of (but is limited by) \nthe resistor divider that sets the output voltage. If the input \nis powered by a voltage source, the LT1965 protects itself \nby shutting off the output.\nThe LT1965 adjustable version incurs no damage if the \nADJ pin is pulled above or below ground by 9V. If the input \nis left open-circuit or grounded, the ADJ pin performs like \na diode in series with typically 1.5k of resistance when \npulled below ground and like a large resistor (typically 5k \nup to 3V on the ADJ pin and then 1.5k up to 9V) in series \nwith a diode when pulled above ground.In situations where the ADJ pin connects to a resistor \ndivider that would pull the ADJ pin above its 9V clamp voltage if the output is pulled high, the ADJ pin input \ncurrent must be limited to less than 5mA. For example, a \nresistor divider is used to provide a regulated 1.5V output \nfrom the 1.20V reference when the output is forced to 20V. \nThe top resistor of the resistor divider must be chosen to \nlimit the current into the ADJ pin to less than 5mA when \nthe ADJ pin is at 9V. The 11V difference between the OUT \nand ADJ pins divided by the 5mA maximum current into \nthe ADJ pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 2.2k.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several \ndifferent input/output conditions can occur. The output \nvoltage may be held up while the input is either pulled \nto ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage, or is left \nopen-circuit. Current flow back into the output follows the \ncurve shown in Figure 6.If the LT1965’s IN pin is forced below the OUT pin or the \nOUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, input current typically \ndrops to less than 2µA. This occurs if the LT1965 input \nis connected to a discharged (low voltage) battery and \neither a backup battery or a second regulator holds up \nthe output. The state of the SHDN pin has no effect on \nthe reverse-output current if the output is pulled above \nthe input.\nFigure 6.
