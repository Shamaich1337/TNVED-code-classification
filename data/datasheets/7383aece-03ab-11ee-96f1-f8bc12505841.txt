The ESD clamping voltageis the voltage drop across the ESD protection diode duringan ESD event per the IEC61000 −4−2 waveform. Since the\nIEC61000 −4−2 was written as a pass/fail spec for largersystems such as cell phones or laptop computers it is not\nclearly de fined in the spec how to specify a clamping voltage\nat the device level. ON Semiconductor has developed a way\nto examine the entire voltage waveform across the ESD\nprotection diode over the time domain of an ESD pulse in the\nform of an oscilloscope screenshot, which can be found onthe datasheets for all ESD protection diodes.

Maximum acceptablePCB mounting pads and solder mask opening are shown inFigure 7.\nFigure 6. Recommended Mounting Pattern\nFigure 7. Maximum Recommended Mounting\nSolder Mask\nTwo types of PCB solder mask openings commonly used\nfor surface mount leadless style packages are:\n1. Non Solder Masked Defined (NSMD)2. Solder Masked Defined (SMD)\nThe solder mask is pulled away from the solderable\nmetallization for NSMD pads, while the solder maskoverlaps the edge of the metallization for SMD pads as\nshown in Figure 8. For SMD pads, the solder mask restricts\nthe flow of solder paste on the top of the metallization andprevents the solder from flowing down the side of the metal\npad. This is different from the NSMD configuration wherethe solder flows both across the top and down the sides of the\nPCB metallization.NSMD SMD\nFigure 8. Comparison of NSMD vs. SMD PadsSolder Mask Openings\nSolder\nMask\nOverlaySolderable\nPCB\nTypically, NSMD pads are preferred over SMD pads. It is\neasier to define and control the location and size of copperpad verses the solder mask opening. This is because thecopper etch process capability has a tighter tolerance thanthat of the solder mask process. NSMD pads also allow foreasier visual inspection of the solder fillet.\nMany PCB designs include a solder mask web between\nmounting pads to prevent solder bridging. For this package,\ntesting has shown that the solder mask web can cause\npackage tilting during the board mount process. Thus, asolder mask web is not recommended.\nPCB Solderable Metallization\nThere are currently three common solderable coatings\nwhich are used for PCB surface mount devices- OSP,ENiAu, and HASL.\nThe first coating consists of an Organic Solderability\nProtectant (OSP) applied over the bare copper features. OSP\ncoating assists in reducing oxidation in order to preserve the\ncopper metallization for soldering. It allows for multiplepasses through reflow ovens without degradation of\nsolderability. The OSP coating is dissolved by the flux when\nsolder paste is applied to the metal features. Coatingthickness recommended by OSP manufacturers is between0.25 and 0.35 microns.\nThe second coating is plated electroless nickel/immersion\ngold over the copper pad. The thickness of the electrolessnickel layer is determined by the allowable internal material\nstresses and the temperature excursions the board will be\nsubjected to throughout its lifetime. Even though the gold\nmetallization is typically a self-limiting process, the\nthickness should be at least 0.05 /C0109m thick, but not consist of\nmore than 5% of the overall solder volume. Excessive goldin the solder joint can create gold embrittlement. This mayaffect the reliability of the joint.\nThe third is a tin-lead coating, commonly called Hot Air\nSolder Level (HASL). This type of PCB pad finish is not\nrecommended for this type packages. The major issue is the\ninability to consistently control the amount of solder coating\napplied to each pad. This results in dome-shaped pads ofvarious heights. As the industry moves to finer and finerpitch, solder bridging between mounting pads becomes acommon problem when using this coating.\nESD11N5.0ST5G\nwww. onsemi.com\n5It is imperative that the coating is conformal, uniform, and\nfree of impurities to insure a consistent mounting process.Due to the package’s extremely small size, we only\nrecommend the use of the electroless nickel/ immersion gold\nmetallization over the copper pads.\nPCB Circuit Trace Width\nThe width of the PCB circuit trace plays an important role\nin the reduction of component tilting when the solder is\nreflowed. A solderable circuit trace allows the solder to wick\nor run down the trace, reducing the overall thickness of thesolder on the PCB and under the component. Due to thesmall nature of the solder pad and component, the solder on\nthe PCB will tend to form a bump causing the component toslide down the side of that solder bump resulting in a tiltedcomponent on the PCB. Allowing the solder to wick or run\ndown the PCB circuit trace, will reduce the solder thickness\nand in turn prevent the solder from forming a ball on the PCB\npad. This was observed during ON Semiconductor boardmounting evaluations. The best results to prevent tiltingused a PCB circuit trace equal to the width of the mounting\npad. The length of the solder wicking or run out is controlled\nby the solder mask opening.\nSolder Type\nSolder pastes such as Cookson Electronics’ WS3060 with\na Type 4 or smaller sphere size are recommended. WS3060has a water -soluble flux for cleaning. Cookson Electronics’\nPNC0106A can be used if a no-clean flux is preferred.\nSolder Stencil Screening\nStencil screening of the solder paste onto the PCB is\ncommonly used in the industry. The recommended stencilthickness for this part is 0.1 mm (0.004 in). The sidewalls of\nthe stencil openings should be tapered approximately fivedegrees along with an electro-polish finish to aid in the\nrelease of the paste when the stencil is removed from the\nPCB. See Figure 9 for the recommended stencil opening size\nand pitch shown on the recommended PCB mounting padsand solder mask opening from Figure 6.\nFigure 9. Recommended Stencil Pattern.A second stencil option is shown in Figure 10. This option\nincreases the amount of solder paste applied to the PCBthrough the stencil. This second option increases the stencil\nopening size and pitch. The PCB mounting pads and solder\nmask opening on the board do not change from therecommendations in Figure 6.\nFigure 10. Maximum Stencil Pattern\nNote: If the maximum stencil opening option from\nFigure 10 is used, tilt may occur on some of the packages.This was evident in the board mounting study we conducted.\nThe stencil with the largest openings may improve solderrelease from the stencil along with slightly increasing the\npackage shear strength.\nPackage Placement\nDue to the small package size and because the pads are on\nthe underside of the package, an automated pick and place\nprocedure with magnification is recommended. A dual\nimage optical system where the underside of the package can\nbe aligned to the PCB should be used. Pick and placeequipment with a standard tolerance of +/- 0.05 mm (0.002\nin) or better is recommended. The package self aligns duringthe reflow process due to the surface tension of the solder.\nDSN2, 0.6x0.3, 0.4P, (0201)\nCASE 152AA\nISSUE B\nDATE 30 APR 2017 SCALE 8:1\nNOTES:\n1.
