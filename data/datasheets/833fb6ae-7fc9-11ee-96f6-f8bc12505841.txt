Actual temperature of the component during system operation (ambient plus \ntemperature rise) must be within the standard operating range.\n2. The saturation current is the current at which the initial inductance drops by \napproximately 30% at the stated ambient temperature. The maximum allowable drop \nat this stated current is 40% of the initial inductance. This current is determined by \nplacing the component in the specified ambient environment and applying a short \nduration pulse current (to eliminate self-heating effect) to the component.\n3. The rated current is the DC current required to raise the component temperature by \napproximately 40°C. Take note that the components’ performanc varies depending \non the system condition. It is suggested that the component be tested at the system \nlevel, to verify the temperature rise of the component during system operation.\n4. The part temperature (ambient+temp rise) should not exceed maximum operating \ntemperature under worst case operating conditions. Circuit design, PCB trace size and thickness, airflow and other cooling provisions all affect the part temperature. Part \ntemperature should be verified in the end application.\n5. Please note that the inductance tolerance of all parts are ±20%, except those \nindicated by an * which are +/- 30%.\n6. Parts shown in bold are standard catalog parts and are available through sample \nstock and distribution. Parts in lighter font are available but are not necessarily held \nin sample stock or distribution and lead times may be longer . Please contact Pulse for \navailablity.\n7.
