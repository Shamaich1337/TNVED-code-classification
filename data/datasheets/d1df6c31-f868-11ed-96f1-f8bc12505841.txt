It is internally configured as a quad-bank\nDRAM. Each of the x16’s 268,435,456-bit banks is organized as 16,384 rows by 1024 col-\numns by 16 bits. Each of the x32’s 268,435,456-bit banks is organized as 8192 rows by\n1024 columns by 32 bits. In the reduced page-size (LG) option, each of the x32’s\n268,435,456-bit banks are organized as 16,384 rows by 512 columns by 32 bits.\nNote:\n1. Throughout this data sheet, various figures and text refer to DQs as “DQ.” DQ should\nbe interpreted as any and all DQ collectively, unless specifically stated otherwise. Addi-\ntionally, the x16 is divided into 2 bytes: the lower byte and the upper byte. For the lower\nbyte (DQ[7:0]), DM refers to LDM and DQS refers to LDQS. For the upper byte\n(DQ[15:8]), DM refers to UDM and DQS refers to UDQS. The x32 is divided into 4 bytes.\nFor DQ[7:0], DM refers to DM0 and DQS refers to DQS0. For DQ[15:8], DM refers to\nDM1 and DQS refers to DQS1. For DQ[23:16], DM refers to DM2 and DQS refers to\nDQS2. For DQ[31:24], DM refers to DM3 and DQS refers to DQS3.\n2. Complete functionality is described throughout the document; any page or diagram\nmay have been simplified to convey a topic and may not be inclusive of all requirements.\n3. Any specific requirement takes precedence over a general statement.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nGeneral Description\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nThe ball descriptions table is a comprehensive list of all possible balls for all supported\npackages. Not all balls listed are supported for a given package.\nTable 3: Ball Descriptions\nSymbol Type Description\nCK, CK# Input Clock: CK is the system clock input. CK and CK# are differential clock inputs. All ad-\ndress and control input signals are sampled on the crossing of the positive edge of CK\nand the negative edge of CK#. Input and output data is referenced to the crossing of\nCK and CK# (both directions of the crossing).\nCKE\nCKE0, CKE1Input Clock enable: CKE HIGH activates, and CKE LOW deactivates, the internal clock signals,\ninput buffers, and output drivers. Taking CKE LOW enables PRECHARGE power-down\nand SELF REFRESH operations (all banks idle), or ACTIVE power-down (row active in\nany bank). CKE is synchronous for all functions except SELF REFRESH exit. All input buf-\nfers (except CKE) are disabled during power-down and self refresh modes.\nCKE0 is used for a single LPDDR product.\nCKE1 is used for dual LPDDR products and is considered RFU for single LPDDR MCPs.\nCS#\nCS0#, CS1#Input Chip select: CS# enables (registered LOW) and disables (registered HIGH) the command\ndecoder. All commands are masked when CS# is registered HIGH. CS# provides for ex-\nternal bank selection on systems with multiple banks. CS# is considered part of the\ncommand code.\nCS0# is used for a single LPDDR product.\nCS1# is used for dual LPDDR products and is considered RFU for single LPDDR MCPs.\nRAS#, CAS#, WE# Input Command inputs: RAS#, CAS#, and WE# (along with CS#) define the command being\nentered.\nUDM, LDM (x16)\nDM[3:0] (x32)Input Input data mask: DM is an input mask signal for write data. Input data is masked\nwhen DM is sampled HIGH along with that input data during a WRITE access. DM is\nsampled on both edges of DQS. Although DM balls are input-only, the DM loading is\ndesigned to match that of DQ and DQS balls.\nBA0, BA1 Input Bank address inputs: BA0 and BA1 define to which bank an ACTIVE, READ, WRITE, or\nPRECHARGE command is being applied. BA0 and BA1 also determine which mode reg-\nister is loaded during a LOAD MODE REGISTER command.\nA[13:0] Input Address inputs: Provide the row address for ACTIVE commands, and the column ad-\ndress and auto precharge bit (A10) for READ or WRITE commands, to select one\nlocation out of the memory array in the respective bank. During a PRECHARGE com-\nmand, A10 determines whether the PRECHARGE applies to one bank (A10 LOW, bank\nselected by BA0, BA1) or all banks (A10 HIGH). The address inputs also provide the op-\ncode during a LOAD MODE REGISTER command. The maximum address range is de-\npendent upon configuration. Unused address balls become RFU.\nTEST Input Test pin: Must be tied to V SS or V SSQ in normal operations.\nDQ[15:0] (x16)\nDQ[31:0] (x32)Input/\noutputData input/output: Data bus for x16 and x32.\nLDQS, UDQS (x16)\nDQS[3:0] (x32)Input/\noutputData strobe: Output with read data, input with write data. DQS is edge-aligned with\nread data, center-aligned in write data. It is used to capture data.\nTQ Output Temperature sensor output: TQ HIGH when LPDDR T J exceeds 85°C.\nVDDQ Supply DQ power supply.\nVSSQ Supply DQ ground.\nVDD Supply Power supply.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nBall Assignments and Descriptions\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All voltages referenced to V SS.\n2. All parameters assume proper device initialization.\n3. Tests for AC timing, I DD, and electrical AC and DC characteristics may be conducted at\nnominal supply voltage levels, but the related specifications and device operation are\nguaranteed for the full voltage range specified.\n4. Outputs measured with equivalent load; transmission line delay is assumed to be very\nsmall:\nI/O\n20pFI/O\n10pF\nFull drive strength Half drive strength50 50\n5. Timing and I DD tests may use a V IL-to-V IH swing of up to 1.5V in the test environment,\nbut input timing is still referenced to V DDQ/2  (or to the crossing point for CK/CK#). The\noutput timing reference voltage level is V DDQ/2 .\n6. Any positive glitch must be less than one-third of the clock cycle and not more than\n+200mV or 2.0V, whichever is less. Any negative glitch must be less than one-third of\nthe clock cycle and not exceed either –150mV or 1.6V, whichever is more positive.\n7. V DD and V DDQ must track each other and V DDQ must be less than or equal to V DD.\n8. To maintain a valid level, the transitioning edge of the input must:\n8a. Sustain a constant slew rate from the current AC level through to the target AC lev-\nel, V IL(AC) Or V IH(AC) .\n8b. Reach at least the target AC level.\n8c. After the AC target level is reached, continue to maintain at least the target DC lev-\nel, V IL(DC) or V IH(DC) .\n9.VIH overshoot: V IHmax  = V DDQ + 1.0V for a pulse width ≤3ns and the pulse width cannot\nbe greater than one-third of the cycle rate. V IL undershoot: V ILmin = –1.0V for a pulse\nwidth ≤3ns and the pulse width cannot be greater than one-third of the cycle rate.\n10.CK and CK# input slew rate must be ≥1 V/ns (2 V/ns if measured differentially).\n11. V ID is the magnitude of the difference between the input level on CK and the input lev-\nel on CK#.\n12. The value of V IX is expected to equal V DDQ/2  of the transmitting device and must track\nvariations in the DC level of the same.\n13. DQ and DM input slew rates must not deviate from DQS by more than 10%. 50ps must\nbe added to tDS and tDH for each 100 mV/ns reduction in slew rate. If slew rate exceeds\n4 V/ns, functionality is uncertain.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nElectrical Specifications\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All voltages referenced to V SS.\n2. Tests for I DD characteristics may be conducted at nominal supply voltage levels, but the\nrelated specifications and device operation are guaranteed for the full voltage range\nspecified.\n3. Timing and I DD tests may use a V IL-to-V IH swing of up to 1.5V in the test environment,\nbut input timing is still referenced to V DDQ/2  (or to the crossing point for CK/CK#). The\noutput timing reference voltage level is V DDQ/2 .\n4. I DD is dependent on output loading and cycle rates. Specified values are obtained with\nminimum cycle time with the outputs open.\n5. I DD specifications are tested after the device is properly initialized and values are aver-\naged at the defined cycle rate.\n6. MIN (tRC or tRFC) for I DD measurements is the smallest multiple of tCK that meets the\nminimum absolute value for the respective parameter. tRASmax for I DD measurements is\nthe largest multiple of tCK that meets the maximum absolute value for tRAS.\n7. Measurement is taken 500ms after entering into this operating mode to provide settling\ntime for the tester.\n8. V DD must not vary more than 4% if CKE is not active while any bank is active.\n9. I DD2N specifies DQ, DQS, and DM to be driven to a valid high or low logic level.\n10. CKE must be active (HIGH) during the entire time a REFRESH command is executed.\nFrom the time the AUTO REFRESH command is registered, CKE must be active at each\nrising clock edge until tRFC later.\n11. This limit is a nominal value and does not result in a fail. CKE is HIGH during REFRESH\ncommand period (tRFC (MIN)) else CKE is LOW (for example, during standby).\n12. Values for I DD6 85˚C are guaranteed for the entire temperature range. All other I DD6 val-\nues are estimated.\n13. Typical values at 25˚C, not a maximum value.\n14.

The CK/CK# input reference voltage level (for timing referenced to CK/CK#) is the point\nat which CK and CK# cross; the input reference voltage level for signals other than CK/\nCK# is V DDQ/2 .\n6.A CK and CK# input slew rate ≥1 V/ns (2 V/ns if measured differentially) is assumed for\nall parameters.\n7. All AC timings assume an input slew rate of 1 V/ns.\n8. CAS latency definition: with CL = 2, the first data element is valid at (tCK + tAC) after the\nclock at which the READ command was registered; for CL = 3, the first data element is\nvalid at (2 × tCK + tAC) after the first clock at which the READ command was registered.\n9. Timing tests may use a V IL-to-V IH swing of up to 1.5V in the test environment, but input\ntiming is still referenced to V DDQ/2  or to the crossing point for CK/CK#. The output tim-\ning reference voltage level is V DDQ/2 .\n10. Clock frequency change is only permitted during clock stop, power-down, or self refresh\nmode.\n11.tDAL = (tWR/tCK) + (tRP/tCK): for each term, if not already an integer, round up to the\nnext highest integer.\n12. Referenced to each output group: for x16, LDQS with DQ[7:0]; and UDQS with DQ[15:8].\nFor x32, DQS0 with DQ[7:0]; DQS1 with DQ[15:8]; DQS2 with DQ[23:16]; and DQS3 with\nDQ[31:24].\n13. DQ  and DM input  slew rates  must  not deviate  from  DQS by more  than  10%.  If the DQ/DM/\nDQS slew rate is less than 1.0 V/ns, timing must be derated: 50ps must be added to tDS\nand tDH for each 100 mV/ns reduction in slew rate. If the slew rate exceeds 4 V/ns, func-\ntionality is uncertain.\n14. The transition time for input signals (CAS#, CKE, CS#, DM, DQ, DQS, RAS#, WE#, and ad-\ndresses) are measured between V IL(DC) to V IH(AC)  for rising input signals and V IH(DC)  to\nVIL(AC) for falling input signals.\n15. These parameters guarantee device timing but are not tested on each device.\n16. The valid data window is derived by achieving other specifications: tHP (tCK/2), tDQSQ,\nand tQH (tHP - tQHS). The data valid window derates directly proportional with the clock\nduty cycle and a practical data valid window can be derived. The clock is provided a max-\nimum duty cycle variation of 45/55. Functionality is uncertain when operating beyond a\n45/55 ratio.\n17.tHP (MIN) is the lesser of tCL (MIN) and tCH (MIN) actually applied to the device CK and\nCK# inputs, collectively.\n18.tHZ and tLZ transitions occur in the same access time windows as valid data transitions.\nThese parameters are not referenced to a specific voltage level, but specify when the\ndevice output is no longer driving (tHZ) or begins driving (tLZ).\n19.tHZ (MAX) will prevail over tDQSCK (MAX) + tRPST (MAX) condition.\n20.Fast command/address input slew rate ≥1 V/ns. Slow command/address input slew rate\n≥0.5 V/ns. If the slew rate is less than 0.5 V/ns, timing must be derated: tIS has an addi-\ntional 50ps per each 100 mV/ns reduction in slew rate from the 0.5 V/ns. tIH has 0ps\nadded, therefore, it remains constant. If the slew rate exceeds 4.5 V/ns, functionality is\nuncertain.\n21. READs and WRITEs with auto precharge must not be issued until tRAS (MIN) can be satis-\nfied prior to the internal PRECHARGE command being issued.\n22.The refresh period equals 64ms. This equates to an average refresh rate of  7.8125μ s.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nElectrical Specifications – AC Operating Conditions\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

The device will operate with a negative value, but system per-\nformance could be degraded due to bus turnaround.\n24. It is recommended that DQS be valid (HIGH or LOW) on or before the WRITE command.\nThe case shown (DQS going from High-Z to logic low) applies when no WRITEs were pre-\nviously in progress on the bus. If a previous WRITE was in progress, DQS could be HIGH\nduring this time, depending on tDQSS.\n25. The maximum limit for this parameter is not a device limit. The device will operate with\na greater value for this parameter, but system performance (bus turnaround) will de-\ngrade accordingly.\n26. At least 1 clock cycle is required during tWR time when in auto precharge mode.\n27. For the automotive temperature parts,  tREF =  tREF/2 and  tREFI =  tREFI/2.\n28. Clock must be toggled a minimum of two times during the tXSR period.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nElectrical Specifications – AC Operating Conditions\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nFunctional Description\nThe Mobile LPDDR SDRAM uses a double data rate architecture to achieve high-speed\noperation. The double data rate architecture is essentially a 2 n-prefetch architecture,\nwith an interface designed to transfer two data words per clock cycle at the I/O. Single\nread or write access for the device consists of a single 2 n-bit-wide, one-clock-cycle data\ntransfer at the internal DRAM core and two corresponding n-bit-wide, one-half-clock-\ncycle data transfers at the I/O.\nA bidirectional data strobe (DQS) is transmitted externally, along with data, for use in\ndata capture at the receiver. DQS is a strobe transmitted by the device during READs\nand by the memory controller during WRITEs. DQS is edge-aligned with data for READs\nand center-aligned with data for WRITEs. The x16 device has two data strobes, one for\nthe lower byte and one for the upper byte; the x32 device has four data strobes, one per\nbyte.\nThe LPDDR device operates from a differential clock (CK and CK#); the crossing of CK\ngoing HIGH and CK# going LOW will be referred to as the positive edge of CK. Com-\nmands (address and control signals) are registered at every positive edge of CK. Input\ndata is registered on both edges of DQS, and output data is referenced to both edges of\nDQS, as well as to both edges of CK.\nRead and write accesses to the device are burst-oriented; accesses start at a selected\nlocation and continue for a programmed number of locations in a programmed se-\nquence. Accesses begin with the registration of an ACTIVE command, followed by a\nREAD  or WRITE  command.  The  address  bits registered  coincident  with  the ACTIVE  com-\nmand are used to select the bank and row to be accessed. The address bits registered\ncoincident with the READ or WRITE command are used to select the starting column\nlocation for the burst access.\nThe device provides for programmable READ or WRITE burst lengths of 2, 4, 8, or 16. An\nauto precharge function can be enabled to provide a self-timed row precharge that is\ninitiated at the end of the burst access.\nAs with standard DDR SDRAM, the pipelined, multibank architecture of LPDDR sup-\nports concurrent operation, thereby providing high effective bandwidth by hiding row\nprecharge and activation time.\nAn auto refresh mode is provided, along with a power-saving power-down mode. Deep\npower-down mode is offered to achieve maximum power reduction by eliminating the\npower of the memory array. Data will not be retained after the device enters deep power-\ndown mode.\nTwo self refresh features, temperature-compensated self refresh (TCSR) and partial-ar-\nray self refresh (PASR), offer additional power savings. TCSR is controlled by the auto-\nmatic on-chip temperature sensor. PASR can be customized using the extended mode\nregister  settings.  The  two  features  can be combined  to achieve  even  greater  power  savings.\nThe DLL that is typically used on standard DDR devices is not necessary on LPDDR de-\nvices.

The values on the BA0 and BA1 inputs select the bank, and the address provided\non inputs A[0: n] selects the row. This row remains active for accesses until a PRE-\nCHARGE command is issued to that bank. A PRECHARGE command must be issued\nbefore opening a different row in the same bank.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

The bank(s) will be available for a subsequent row access a\nspecified time (tRP) after the PRECHARGE command is issued. Input A10 determines\nwhether one or all banks will be precharged, and in the case where only one bank is\nprecharged, inputs BA0 and BA1 select the bank. Otherwise, BA0 and BA1 are treated as\n“Don’t Care.” After a bank has been precharged, it is in the idle state and must be activa-\nted prior to any READ or WRITE commands being issued to that bank.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

The most recently registered READ command prior to the BURST\nTERMINATE command will be truncated, as described in READ Operation (page 65).\nThe open page from which the READ was terminated remains open.\nAUTO REFRESH\nAUTO  REFRESH  is used  during  normal  operation  of the device  and  is analogous  to CAS#-\nBEFORE-RAS# (CBR) REFRESH in FPM/EDO DRAM. The AUTO REFRESH command is\nnonpersistent and must be issued each time a refresh is required.\nAddressing is generated by the internal refresh controller. This makes the address bits a\n“Don’t Care” during an AUTO REFRESH command.\nFor improved efficiency in scheduling and switching between tasks, some flexibility in\nthe absolute refresh interval is provided. The auto refresh period begins when the AU-\nTO REFRESH command is registered and ends tRFC later.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nSELF REFRESH\nThe SELF REFRESH command is used to place the device in self refresh mode; self re-\nfresh mode is used to retain data in the memory device while the rest of the system is\npowered  down.  When  in self refresh  mode,  the device  retains  data  without  external  clock-\ning. The SELF REFRESH command is initiated like an AUTO REFRESH command,\nexcept that CKE is disabled (LOW). After the SELF REFRESH command is registered, all\ninputs to the device become “Don’t Care” with the exception of CKE, which must re-\nmain LOW.\nMicron recommends that, prior to self refresh entry and immediately upon self refresh\nexit, the user perform a burst auto refresh cycle for the number of refresh rows. Alterna-\ntively, if a distributed refresh pattern is used, this pattern should be immediately\nresumed upon self refresh exit.\nDEEP POWER-DOWN\nThe DEEP POWER-DOWN (DPD) command is used to enter DPD mode, which ach-\nieves maximum power reduction by eliminating the power to the memory array. Data\nwill not be retained when the device enters DPD mode. The DPD command is the same\nas a BURST TERMINATE command with CKE LOW.\nFigure 17: DEEP POWER-DOWN Command\nCS#\nWE#CAS#RAS#CKE\nAddress\nBA0, BA1CKCK#\nDon’t Care1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

Using initialization procedures other than those specified will result in\nundefined operation.\nIf there is an interruption to the device power, the device must be re-initialized using\nthe initialization sequence described below to ensure proper functionality of the device.\nTo properly initialize the device, this sequence must be followed:\n1. The core power (V DD) and I/O power (V DDQ ) must be brought up simultaneously.\nIt is recommended that V DD and V DDQ  be from the same power source, or V DDQ\nmust never exceed V DD. Standard initialization requires that CKE be asserted\nHIGH (see Figure 19 (page 54)). Alternatively, initialization can be completed\nwith CKE LOW provided that CKE transitions HIGH tIS prior to T0 (see Figure 20\n(page 55)).\n2. When power supply voltages are stable and the CKE has been driven HIGH, it is\nsafe to apply the clock.\n3. When the clock is stable, a  200μ s minimum delay is required by the Mobile\nLPDDR prior to applying an executable command. During this time, NOP or DESE-\nLECT commands must be issued on the command bus.\n4. Issue a PRECHARGE ALL command.\n5. Issue NOP or DESELECT commands for at least tRP time.\n6. Issue an AUTO REFRESH command followed by NOP or DESELECT commands\nfor at least tRFC time. Issue a second AUTO REFRESH command followed by NOP\nor DESELECT commands for at least tRFC time. Two AUTO REFRESH commands\nmust be issued. Typically, both of these commands are issued at this stage as de-\nscribed above.\n7. Using the LOAD MODE REGISTER command, load the standard mode register as\ndesired.\n8. Issue NOP or DESELECT commands for at least tMRD time.\n9. Using the LOAD MODE REGISTER command, load the extended mode register to\nthe desired operating modes. Note that the sequence in which the standard and\nextended mode registers are programmed is not critical.\n10.

Reserved states\nshould not be used as this may result in setting the device into an unknown state or\ncause incompatibility with future versions of LPDDR devices. The standard mode regis-\nter is programmed via the LOAD MODE REGISTER command (with BA0 = 0 and BA1 =\n0) and will retain the stored information until it is programmed again, until the device\ngoes into deep power-down mode, or until the device loses power.\nReprogramming the mode register will not alter the contents of the memory, provided\nit is performed correctly. The mode register must be loaded when all banks are idle and\nno bursts are in progress, and the controller must wait tMRD before initiating the subse-\nquent  operation.  Violating  any of these  requirements  will result  in unspecified  operation.\nFigure 21: Standard Mode Register Definition\n \nM3 = 0\nReserved\n2\n4\n8\n16\nReserved\nReserved\nReservedM3 = 1\nReserved\n2\n4\n8\n16\nReserved\nReserved\nReserved\nM3 \n0\n1Burst Type \nSequential\nInterleavedCAS Latency\nReserved\nReserved\n2\n3\nReserved\nReserved\nReserved\nReservedBurst Length\nM0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1Burst Length CAS Latency BT 0A9 A7A6A5A4A3 A8 A2A1A0\nStandard mode register (Mx)Address bus\n9 76543 8 210\nM1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1M2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\nM4\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1M5\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1M6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1Operating ModeA10 An...

The burst length determines the maximum number of column loca-\ntions that can be accessed for a given READ or WRITE command. Burst lengths of 2, 4,\n8, or 16 locations are available for both sequential and interleaved burst types.\nWhen a READ or WRITE command is issued, a block of columns equal to the burst\nlength is effectively selected. All accesses for that burst take place within this block,\nmeaning that the burst will wrap when a boundary is reached. The block is uniquely\nselected by A[ i:1] when BL = 2, by A[ i:2] when BL = 4, by A[ i:3] when BL = 8, and by A[ i:4]\nwhen BL = 16, where A i is the most significant column address bit for a given configura-\ntion. The remaining (least significant) address bits are used to specify the starting\nlocation within the block. The programmed burst length applies to both READ and\nWRITE bursts.\nBurst Type\nAccesses within a given burst can be programmed to be either sequential or interleaved\nvia the standard mode register.\nThe ordering of accesses within a burst is determined by the burst length, the burst\ntype, and the starting column address.\nTable 22: Burst Definition Table\nBurst\nLength Starting Column AddressOrder of Accesses Within a Burst\nType = Sequential Type = Interleaved\n2  A0   \n  0 0-1 0-1\n1 1-0 1-0\n4  A1 A0   \n  0 0 0-1-2-3 0-1-2-3\n0 1 1-2-3-0 1-0-3-2\n1 0 2-3-0-1 2-3-0-1\n1 1 3-0-1-2 3-2-1-0\n8  A2 A1 A0   \n  0 0 0 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7\n0 0 1 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0 1-0-3-2-5-4-7-6\n0 1 0 2-3-4-5-6-7-0-1 2-3-0-1-6-7-4-5\n0 1 1 3-4-5-6-7-0-1-2 3-2-1-0-7-6-5-4\n1 0 0 4-5-6-7-0-1-2-3 4-5-6-7-0-1-2-3\n1 0 1 5-6-7-0-1-2-3-4 5-4-7-6-1-0-3-2\n1 1 0 6-7-0-1-2-3-4-5 6-7-4-5-2-3-0-1\n1 1 1 7-0-1-2-3-4-5-6 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-0\n16 A3 A2 A1 A0   1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nStandard Mode Register\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

The latency can be set to 2 or 3\nclocks, as shown in Figure 22 (page 59).\nFor CL = 3, if the READ command is registered at clock edge n, then the data will be\nnominally available at ( n + 2 clocks + tAC). For CL = 2, if the READ command is regis-\ntered at clock edge  n, then the data will be nominally available at ( n + 1 clock + tAC).1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nStandard Mode Register\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nPartial-Array Self Refresh\nFor further power savings during self refresh, the partial-array self refresh (PASR) fea-\nture enables the controller to select the amount of memory to be refreshed during self\nrefresh. The refresh options include:\n•Full array: banks 0, 1, 2, and 3\n•One-half array: banks 0 and 1\n•One-quarter array: bank 0\n•One-eighth array: bank 0 with row address most significant bit (MSB) = 0\n•One-sixteenth array: bank 0 with row address MSB = 0 and row address MSB - 1 = 0\nREAD and WRITE commands can still be issued to the full array during standard opera-\ntion, but only the selected regions of the array will be refreshed during self refresh. Data\nin regions that are not selected will be lost.\nOutput Drive Strength\nBecause the device is designed for use in smaller systems that are typically point-to-\npoint connections, an option to control the drive strength of the output buffers is\nprovided. Drive strength should be selected based on the expected loading of the mem-\nory bus. The output driver settings are  25Ω, 37Ω,  and 55Ω  internal impedance for full,\nthree-quarter, and one-half drive strengths, respectively.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nExtended Mode Register\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

The\nSRR is read via the LOAD MODE REGISTER command with BA0 = 1 and BA1 = 0. The\nsequence to perform an SRR command is as follows:\n1. The  device  must  be properly  initialized  and  in the idle or all banks  precharged  state.\n2. Issue a LOAD MODE REGISTER command with BA[1:0] = 01 and all address pins\nset to 0.\n3. Wait tSRR; only NOP or DESELECT commands are supported during the tSRR time.\n4. Issue a READ command.\n5. Subsequent commands to the device must be issued tSRC after the SRR READ com-\nmand is issued; only NOP or DESELECT commands are supported during tSRC.\nSRR output is read with a burst length of 2. SRR data is driven to the outputs on the first\nbit of the burst, with the output being “Don’t Care” on the second bit of the burst.\nFigure 24: Status Read Register Timing\n \nCommand\nBA0, BA1CKCK#\nAddressREAD NOP NOPT0 T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6\nDon’t CareNOP\nDQS\nDQSRR\nout4tRPtSRRtSRC\nPRE1 LMR NOP2NOP ValidT8\nBA0 = 1\nBA1 = 00\nNote 5CL = 33\nTransitioning Data\nNotes: 1.

All rights reserved.\nBank/Row Activation\nBefore any READ or WRITE commands can be issued to a bank within the device, a row\nin that bank must be opened. This is accomplished via the ACTIVE command, which\nselects both the bank and the row to be activated (see Figure 13 (page 42)). After a row is\nopened with the ACTIVE command, a READ or WRITE command can be issued to that\nrow, subject to the tRCD specification.\nA subsequent ACTIVE command to a different row in the same bank can only be issued\nafter the previous active row has been precharged. The minimum time interval between\nsuccessive ACTIVE commands to the same bank is defined by tRC.\nA subsequent ACTIVE command to another bank can be issued while the first bank is\nbeing accessed, which results in a reduction of total row access overhead. The mini-\nmum time interval between successive ACTIVE commands to different banks is defined\nby tRRD.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nBank/Row Activation\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

The starting column and bank addresses are provided with the READ com-\nmand, and auto precharge is either enabled or disabled for that burst access. If auto\nprecharge is enabled, the row being accessed is precharged at the completion of the\nburst. For the READ commands used in the following illustrations, auto precharge is\ndisabled.\nDuring READ bursts, the valid data-out element from the starting column address will\nbe available following the CL after the READ command. Each subsequent data-out ele-\nment will be valid nominally at the next positive or negative clock edge. Figure 26\n(page 66) shows general timing for each possible CL setting.\nDQS is driven by the device along with output data. The initial LOW state on DQS is\nknown as the read preamble; the LOW state coincident with the last data-out element is\nknown as the read postamble. The READ burst is considered complete when the read\npostamble is satisfied.\nUpon completion of a burst, assuming no other commands have been initiated, the DQ\nwill go to High-Z. A detailed explanation of tDQSQ (valid data-out skew), tQH (data-out\nwindow hold), and the valid data window is depicted in Figure 33 (page 73) and Fig-\nure 34 (page 74). A detailed explanation of tDQSCK (DQS transition skew to CK) and\ntAC (data-out transition skew to CK) is depicted in Figure 35 (page 75).\nData from any READ burst can be truncated by a READ or WRITE command to the\nsame or alternate bank, by a BURST TERMINATE command, or by a PRECHARGE com-\nmand to the same bank, provided that the auto precharge mode was not activated.\nData from any READ burst can be concatenated with or truncated with data from a sub-\nsequent READ command. In either case, a continuous flow of data can be maintained.\nThe first data element from the new burst either follows the last element of a completed\nburst or the last desired data element of a longer burst that is being truncated. The new\nREAD command should be issued x cycles after the first READ command, where x\nequals the number of desired data element pairs (pairs are required by the 2 n-prefetch\narchitecture). This is shown in Figure 27 (page 67).\nA READ command can be initiated on any clock cycle following a previous READ com-\nmand. Nonconsecutive read data is shown in Figure 28 (page 68). Full-speed random\nread accesses within a page (or pages) can be performed as shown in Figure 29\n(page 69).\nData from any READ burst can be truncated with a BURST TERMINATE command, as\nshown in Figure 30 (page 70). The BURST TERMINATE latency is equal to the READ\n(CAS) latency; for example, the BURST TERMINATE command should be issued x cy-\ncles after the READ command, where x equals the number of desired data element pairs\n(pairs are required by the 2 n-prefetch architecture).\nData from any READ burst must be completed or truncated before a subsequent WRITE\ncommand can be issued. If truncation is necessary, the BURST TERMINATE command\nmust be used, as shown in Figure 31 (page 71). A READ burst can be followed by, or\ntruncated with, a PRECHARGE command to the same bank, provided that auto pre-\ncharge was not activated. The PRECHARGE command should be issued x cycles after\nthe READ command, where x equals the number of desired data element pairs. This is\nshown in Figure 32 (page 72). Following the PRECHARGE command, a subsequent1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nREAD Operation\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

If auto precharge is ena-\nbled, the row being accessed is precharged at the completion of the burst. For the\nWRITE commands used in the following illustrations, auto precharge is disabled. Basic\ndata input timing is shown in Figure 36 (page 77) (this timing applies to all WRITE\noperations).\nInput data appearing on the data bus is written to the memory array subject to the state\nof data mask (DM) inputs coincident with the data. If DM is registered LOW, the corre-\nsponding data will be written; if DM is registered HIGH, the corresponding data will be\nignored, and the write will not be executed to that byte/column location. DM operation\nis illustrated in Figure 37 (page 78).\nDuring WRITE bursts, the first valid data-in element will be registered on the first rising\nedge of DQS following the WRITE command, and subsequent data elements will be reg-\nistered on successive edges of DQS. The LOW state of DQS between the WRITE com-\nmand and the first rising edge is known as the write preamble; the LOW state of DQS\nfollowing the last data-in element is known as the write postamble. The WRITE burst is\ncomplete when the write postamble and tWR or tWTR are satisfied.\nThe time between the WRITE command and the first corresponding rising edge of DQS\n(tDQSS) is specified with a relatively wide range (75%–125% of one clock cycle). All\nWRITE diagrams show the nominal case. Where the two extreme cases (that is, tDQSS\n[MIN] and tDQSS [MAX]) might not be obvious, they have also been included. Figure 38\n(page 79) shows the nominal case and the extremes of tDQSS for a burst of 4. Upon\ncompletion of a burst, assuming no other commands have been initiated, the DQ will\nremain High-Z and any additional input data will be ignored.\nData for any WRITE burst can be concatenated with or truncated by a subsequent\nWRITE command. In either case, a continuous flow of input data can be maintained.\nThe new WRITE command can be issued on any positive edge of clock following the\nprevious WRITE command. The first data element from the new burst is applied after\neither the last element of a completed burst or the last desired data element of a longer\nburst that is being truncated. The new WRITE command should be issued x cycles after\nthe first WRITE command, where x equals the number of desired data element pairs\n(pairs are required by the 2 n-prefetch architecture).\nFigure 39 (page 80) shows concatenated bursts of 4. An example of nonconsecutive\nWRITEs is shown in Figure 40 (page 80). Full-speed random write accesses within a\npage or pages can be performed, as shown in Figure 41 (page 81).\nData for any WRITE burst can be followed by a subsequent READ command. To follow\na WRITE without truncating the WRITE burst, tWTR should be met, as shown in Fig-\nure 42 (page 82).\nData for any WRITE burst can be truncated by a subsequent READ command, as shown\nin Figure 43 (page 83). Note that only the data-in pairs that are registered prior to the\ntWTR period are written to the internal array, and any subsequent data-in should be\nmasked with DM, as shown in Figure 44 (page 84).\nData for any WRITE burst can be followed by a subsequent PRECHARGE command.

The bank(s) will be available for a subsequent row access\nsome specified time (tRP) after the PRECHARGE command is issued. Input A10 deter-\nmines whether one or all banks will be precharged, and in the case where only one bank\nis precharged (A10 = LOW), inputs BA0 and BA1 select the bank. When all banks are\nprecharged (A10 = HIGH), inputs BA0 and BA1 are treated as “Don’t Care.” After a bank\nhas been precharged, it is in the idle state and must be activated prior to any READ or\nWRITE commands being issued to that bank. A PRECHARGE command will be treated\nas a NOP if there is no open row in that bank (idle state), or if the previously open row is\nalready in the process of precharging.\nAuto Precharge\nAuto precharge is a feature that performs the same individual bank PRECHARGE func-\ntion described previously, without requiring an explicit command. This is accomplish-\ned by using A10 to enable auto precharge in conjunction with a specific READ or WRITE\ncommand. A precharge of the bank/row that is addressed with the READ or WRITE com-\nmand is automatically performed upon completion of the READ or WRITE burst. Auto\nprecharge is nonpersistent; it is either enabled or disabled for each individual READ or\nWRITE command.\nAuto precharge ensures that the precharge is initiated at the earliest valid stage within a\nburst. This earliest valid stage is determined as if an explicit PRECHARGE command\nwas issued at the earliest possible time without violating tRAS (MIN), as described for\neach burst type in Table 20 (page 49). The READ with auto precharge enabled state or\nthe WRITE with auto precharge enabled state can each be broken into two parts: the\naccess period and the precharge period. The access period starts with registration of the\ncommand and ends where tRP (the precharge period) begins. For READ with auto pre-\ncharge, the precharge period is defined as if the same burst was executed with auto\nprecharge disabled, followed by the earliest possible PRECHARGE command that still\naccesses all the data in the burst. For WRITE with auto precharge, the precharge period\nbegins when tWR ends, with tWR measured as if auto precharge was disabled. In addi-\ntion, during a WRITE with auto precharge, at least one clock is required during tWR\ntime. During the precharge period, the user must not issue another command to the\nsame bank until tRP is satisfied.\nThis device supports tRAS lock-out. In the case of a single READ with auto precharge or\nsingle WRITE with auto precharge issued at tRCD (MIN), the internal precharge will be\ndelayed until tRAS (MIN) has been satisfied.\nBank READ operations with and without auto precharge are shown in Figure 48\n(page 90) and Figure 49 (page 91). Bank WRITE operations with and without auto\nprecharge are shown in Figure 50 (page 92) and Figure 51 (page 93).1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nPRECHARGE Operation\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nConcurrent Auto Precharge\nThis device supports concurrent auto precharge such that when a READ with auto pre-\ncharge is enabled or a WRITE with auto precharge is enabled, any command to another\nbank is supported, as long as that command does not interrupt the read or write data\ntransfer already in process. This feature enables the precharge to complete in the bank\nin which the READ or WRITE with auto precharge was executed, without requiring an\nexplicit PRECHARGE command, thus freeing the command bus for operations in other\nbanks.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nAuto Precharge\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

The AUTO REFRESH com-\nmand is nonpersistent and must be issued each time a refresh is required.\nThe addressing is generated by the internal refresh controller. This makes the address\nbits a “Don’t Care” during an AUTO REFRESH command.\nFor improved efficiency in scheduling and switching between tasks, some flexibility in\nthe absolute refresh interval is provided. The auto refresh period begins when the AU-\nTO REFRESH command is registered and ends tRFC later.\nFigure 52: Auto Refresh Mode\n \nCK\nCKECK#\nCommand1NOP2Valid Valid\nNOP 2 NOP2PRE\nRow\nA10\nBA0, BA1 Bank(s)5BankAR NOP2, 3AR4NOP2, 3ACTIVE NOP2\nOne bankAll bankstCKtCHtCL\ntIStIS\ntIHtIH\nRow(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n))\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nDQ6\nDM6DQS6(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\ntRFC4 tRPtRFCT0T1 T2 T3 T4 Ta0 Tb0 Ta1 Tb1 Tb2\nDon’t Care))\n(\n)(\n)\nAddress(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)))\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n((\n))\nNotes: 1.

Bank x at T1 is “Don’t Care” if A10 is HIGH at this point; A10 must be HIGH if more than\none bank is active (for example, must precharge all active banks).\n6. DM, DQ, and DQS signals are all “Don’t Care”/High-Z for operations shown.\nAlthough it is not a JEDEC requirement, CKE must be active (HIGH) during the auto\nrefresh period to provide support for future functional features. The auto refresh period\nbegins when the AUTO REFRESH command is registered and ends tRFC later.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nAUTO REFRESH Operation\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nSELF REFRESH Operation\nThe SELF REFRESH command can be used to retain data in the device while the rest of\nthe system is powered down. When in self refresh mode, the device retains data without\nexternal clocking. The SELF REFRESH command is initiated like an AUTO REFRESH\ncommand, except that CKE is disabled (LOW). All command and address input signals\nexcept CKE are “Don’t Care” during self refresh.\nDuring self refresh, the device is refreshed as defined in the extended mode register.\n(see Partial-Array Self Refresh  (page 61).) An internal temperature sensor adjusts the\nrefresh rate to optimize device power consumption while ensuring data integrity. (See\nTemperature-Compensated Self Refresh  (page 60).)\nThe procedure for exiting self refresh requires a sequence of commands. First, CK must\nbe stable prior to CKE going HIGH. When CKE is HIGH, the device must have NOP com-\nmands issued for tXSR to complete any internal refresh already in progress.\nDuring SELF REFRESH operation, refresh intervals are scheduled internally and may\nvary. These refresh intervals may differ from the specified tREFI time. For this reason,\nthe SELF REFRESH command must not be used as a substitute for the AUTO REFRESH\ncommand.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nSELF REFRESH Operation\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

Either  a NOP or DESELECT  command  is required  for tXSR time  with  at least  two clock  pulses.\nPower-Down\nPower-down is entered when CKE is registered LOW. If power-down occurs when all\nbanks are idle, this mode is referred to as precharge power-down; if power-down occurs\nwhen there is a row active in any bank, this mode is referred to as active power-down.\nEntering power-down deactivates all input and output buffers, including CK and CK#\nand excluding CKE. Exiting power-down requires the device to be at the same voltage as\nwhen it entered power-down and received a stable clock. Note that the power-down\nduration is limited by the refresh requirements of the device.\nWhen in power-down, CKE LOW must be maintained at the inputs of the device, while\nall other input signals are “Don’t Care.” The power-down state is synchronously exited\nwhen CKE is registered HIGH (in conjunction with a NOP or DESELECT command).\nNOP or DESELECT commands must be maintained on the command bus until tXP is\nsatisfied. See Figure 55 (page 98) for a detailed illustration of power-down mode.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nPower-Down\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

If this command is a PRECHARGE (or if the device is already in the idle state), then the\npower-down mode shown is precharge power-down. If this command is an ACTIVE (or if\nat least  1 row is already  active),  then  the power-down  mode  shown  is active  power-down.\n3. No column accesses can be in progress when power-down is entered.\nDeep Power-Down\nDeep power-down (DPD) is an operating mode used to achieve maximum power reduc-\ntion by eliminating power to the memory array. Data will not be retained after the\ndevice enters DPD mode.\nBefore entering DPD mode the device must be in the all banks idle state with no activity\non the data bus (tRP time must be met). DPD mode is entered by holding CS# and WE#\nLOW with RAS# and CAS# HIGH at the rising edge of the clock while CKE is LOW. CKE\nmust be held LOW to maintain DPD mode. The clock must be stable prior to exiting\nDPD mode. To exit DPD mode, assert CKE HIGH with either a NOP or DESELECT com-\nmand present on the command bus. After exiting DPD mode, a full DRAM initialization\nsequence is required.1Gb: x16, x32 Mobile LPDDR SDRAM\nPower-Down\nPDF: 09005aef83d9bee4\n1gb_ddr_mobile_sdram_t68m.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nClock Change Frequency\nOne method of controlling the power efficiency in applications is to throttle the clock\nthat controls the device. The clock can be controlled by changing the clock frequency or\nstopping the clock.\nThe device enables the clock to change frequency during operation only if all timing\nparameters are met and all refresh requirements are satisfied.\nThe clock can be stopped altogether if there are no DRAM operations in progress that\nwould be affected by this change. Any DRAM operation already in process must be com-\npleted before entering clock stop mode; this includes the following timings: tRCD, tRP,\ntRFC, tMRD, tWR, and tRPST. In addition, any READ or WRITE burst in progress must be\ncomplete. (see READ Operation (page 65), and WRITE Operation (page 76).)\nCKE must be held HIGH with CK = LOW and CK# = HIGH for the full duration of the\nclock stop mode. One clock cycle and at least one NOP or DESELECT is required after\nthe clock is restarted before a valid command can be issued.\nFigure 57: Clock Stop Mode\n \nExit clock stop modeCKECKCK#\nCommand(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)NOP NOPTa1 Ta2 Tb3 Tb4\nDon’t CareAddress\nDQ, DQS(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nEnter clock stop mode(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\nCMD2\nValidCMD2\nValidNOP1\n(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\nAll DRAM activities must be complete(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nNotes: 1.
