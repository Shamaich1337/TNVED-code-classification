The\ndevice features a serial data input (DS), eight parallel data inputs (D0 to D7) and two\ncomplementary serial outputs (Q7 and Q7). When the parallel load input ( PL) is LOW the\ndata from D0 to D7 is loaded into the shift register asynchronously. When PL is HIGH\ndata enters the register serially at DS. When the clock enable input ( CE) is LOW data is\nshifted on the LOW-to-HIGH transitions of the CP input. A HIGH on CE will disable the\nCP input. Inputs are overvoltage tolerant to 15 V. This enables the device to be used in\nHIGH-to-LOW level shifting applications.\n2Features and benefits\n•Asynchronous 8-bit parallel load\n•Synchronous serial input\n•Complies with JEDEC standard no. 7A\n•Input levels:\n–For 74HC165: CMOS level\n–For 74HCT165: TTL level\n•ESD protection:\n–HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n–MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and from -40 °C to +125 °C\n3Applications\n•Parallel-to-serial data conversion\nNexperia74HC165; 74HCT165\n8-bit parallel-in/serial out shift register\n74HC_HCT165 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2017.

#### Description:
The **74HC165D** is an 8-bit parallel-in/serial-out shift register designed for digital applications. It allows data to be loaded in parallel from eight input pins (D0 to D7) or shifted in serially through a single data input (DS). The device features two complementary serial outputs (Q7 and Q7) and operates based on clock signals, enabling efficient data handling in various electronic circuits.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Data Conversion:** Used for converting parallel data to serial format, which is essential in communication systems.
- **Microcontroller Interfaces:** Commonly employed in microcontroller applications for expanding input/output capabilities.
- **Level Shifting:** The overvoltage tolerant feature allows it to be used in level shifting applications between different voltage domains.
- **Signal Processing:** Useful in applications requiring data manipulation and processing, such as in digital signal processing circuits.

This component is ideal for applications in consumer electronics, industrial automation, and communication systems where efficient data handling is crucial.
