\n Conventions, Abbreviations and Acronyms    \n  \n\uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2 v Conventions, Abbreviations and Acronyms \nThis hardware manual describes the PCL-063 Sy stem on Module in the following referred to \nas phyCORE®-i.MX 6UL/ULL. The manual specifies the phyCORE®-i.MX 6UL/ULL\'s design and \nfunction. Precise specifications for the NXP® Semiconductor i.MX 6UL/ULL microcontrollers \ncan be found in the enclosed microcontroller Datasheet/User\'s Manual. \n \nNote: We refrain from providing detailed part sp ecific information within this manual, \nwhich can be subject to continuous changes, due to part maintenance for our products. \nPlease read the paragraph " Product Change Management and information in this \nmanual on parts populated on the SOM" within the Preface. \n \nNote: The BSP delivered with the phyCORE®-i.MX 6UL/ULL usually includes drivers and/or \nsoftware for controlling all components such as interfaces, memory, etc. Therefore \nprogramming close to hardware at register leve l is not necessary in most cases. For this \nreason, this manual contains no detailed description of the controller\'s registers, or \ninformation relevant for software development. Please refer to the i.MX 6UL/ULL Reference \nManual , if such information is needed to co nnect customer designed applications. \n \nConventions \nThe conventions used in this manual are as follows: \n\uf0a7 Signals that are preceded by an "n", "/", or “#”character (e.g.: nRD, /RD, or #RD), or \nthat have a dash on top of the signal na me (e.g.: RD) are designated as active low \nsignals. That is, their active state is when they are driven low, or are driving low. \n\uf0a7 A "0" indicates a logic zero or low-level si gnal, while a "1" represents a logic one or \nhigh-level signal. \n\uf0a7 The hex-numbers given for addresses of I2C devices always represent the 7 MSB of the \naddress byte. The correct value of the LS B which depends on the desired command \n(read (1), or write (0)) must be added to get the complete address byte. E.g.  given \naddress in this manual 0x41 => complete addr ess byte = 0x83 to read from the device \nand 0x82 to write to the device \n\uf0a7 Tables which describe jumper settings show the default position in bold,  blue text.   \n\uf0a7 Text in blue italic  indicates a hyperlink within, or external to the document. Click these \nlinks to quickly jump to the applicable  URL, part, chapter, table, or figure. \n\uf0a7 References made to the phyCORE-Connector always refer to the half-hole connector on \nthe four edges of the module together with  the pads on the soldering side of the \nphyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL System on Module. \nphyCORE®-i.MX 6UL/ULL [PCL-063]   \n  \nvi \uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2 Types of Signals \n \nDifferent types of signals are brought out at  the phyCORE-Connector.

The \nphyCORE SOMs represent the continuous de velopment of Phytec System on Module \ntechnology. Like its mini-, micro- and nanoMODUL predecessors, the phyCORE boards \nintegrate all core elements of a microcontro ller system on a subminiature board and are \ndesigned in a manner that ensures their easy expansion and embedding in peripheral \nhardware developments.  \nAs independent research indicates that appr oximately 70 % of all EMI (Electro Magnetic \nInterference) problems stem from insuffici ent supply voltage grounding of electronic \ncomponents in high frequency environments, the phyCORE board design features an \nincreased pin package. The increased pin pack age allows dedication of approximately 20 % \nof all connector pins on the phyCORE board s to Ground. This improves EMI and EMC \ncharacteristics and makes it easier to design complex applications meeting EMI and EMC \nguidelines using phyCORE boards even in high noise environments. \n phyCORE boards achieve their small size thr ough modern SMD technology and multi-layer \ndesign. In accordance with the comple xity of the module, 0402-packaged SMD \ncomponents and laser-drilled microvias are used on the boards, providing phyCORE users with access to this cutting edge miniaturizat ion technology for integration into their own \ndesign.  The phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL is a subminiatu re (35 mm x 35 mm) insert-ready System on \nModule populated with the NXP® Semiconductor i.MX 6UL/ULL microcontroller. Its universal design enables its insertion in a wide range of embedded applications. All controller signals and ports extend from the controller to the half-hole connector pitch (1 \nmm) aligning all four sides of the board, allowi ng it to be soldered like a "big chip" into a \ntarget application. \n Precise specifications for the controller populating the board can be found in the \napplicable controller reference manual or datasheet.

For information about the power \nconsumption please refer to section 4.1. \n  These supply pins are located at the phyCORE-Connector X1:  \nVDD_3V3: \nX1 90, 91, 92, 93 \n \nConnect all +3.3 V VCC input pins to your powe r supply and at least the matching number of \nGND pins.  Corresponding GND: X1 1, 32, 62, 89 \n \nPlease refer to section 2 for information on additional GND Pins located at the phyCORE-\nConnector X1.   \nCaution! \nWe recommend connecting all available +3.3 V in put pins to the power  supply system on a \ncustom carrier board housing the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL and at least the matching \nnumber of GND pins. \n \nIn addition, proper implementation of the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL module into a target \napplication also requires connecting all GND pins. \n  \nPlease refer to section 4 for more  information. \n \n Pin Description   \n  \n\uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2 7 2 Pin Description \nPlease note that all module connections ar e not to exceed their expressed maximum \nvoltage or current. Maximum signal input va lues are indicated in the corresponding \ncontroller manuals/datasheets. As damage from  improper connections varies according to \nuse and application, it is the user\'s responsibility to take appropriate safety measures to \nensure that the module connections are pr otected from overloading through connected \nperipherals.  \nAs Figure 3  indicates, all controller signals selected extend to half-hole surface mount \ntechnology (SMT) connectors (\n1 mm pitch) linin g all four sides of the module (referred to \nas phyCORE-Connector). This allows the phyC ORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL to be soldered into any \ntarget application like a "big chip".  \n The pin numbering values for the phyCORE-Co nnector increases moving around the board \n(Figure 4 ). Pin 1 is marked by number 1 on the t op and the bottom side, as well as by an \norientation mark on the bottom side with only  three pads (in contrast to the orie \nntation \nmarks with four pads in the other corners).  The numbering scheme of the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL is always in relation to the PCB as viewed from above and can be aligned with  the socket of the corresponding phyCORE \nCarrier Board/user target circuitry.  The numbering scheme is thus consistent for both the module’s phyCORE-Connector as well as the mating connector on the phyCORE Ca rrier Board or target hardware, thereby \nconsiderably reducing the risk of pin identification errors.  \nSince the pins are exactly defined according to the numbering scheme described above, \nthe phyCORE-Connector is usually assigned a single designator for its position (X1 for \nexample). In this manner the phyCORE-Conne ctor comprises a single, logical unit \nregardless of the fact that it could cons ist of more than one physical connector. \n \nTable 4 provides an overview of the pinout of th e phyCORE-Connector X1  with signal names\n  \nand descriptions specific to the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL. It also provides the appropriate \nvoltage domain, signal type (ST) and a functional grouping of the signals. The signal type \nincludes also information about the signal direction6. A description of the signal types can \nbe found in Table 1 . \n \n                                                   \n6: The specified direction indicated refers to the pins\' use according to the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL specification.  \nphyCORE®-i.MX 6UL/ULL [PCL-063]   \n  \n8 \uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2  \nFigure 4: Pinout of the ph yCORE-Connector (top view) \n \nCaution! \nThere was a change of the pin-assignment  in a former PCB revision as can be seen in Table \n3. Do only use new pin-assignment correspon ding to PCB-No. 1468.1 for your baseboard \ndesigns.

Please \nrefer to the NXP Semiconductor i.MX 6UL/ULL Reference Manual  for details on the \nfunctions and features of controller signals and port pins.  \n\uf0b7 As some of the signals which are brought out  on the phyCORE-Connector are used to \nconfigure the boot mode for specific boot opt ions, please make sure that these signals \nare not driven by any device on the base board during reset. The signals which may \naffect the boot configuration are shown in  Table 8 . \n\uf0b7 It is mandatory to avoid voltages at the IO pins of the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL which are \nsourced from the supply voltage of periph eral devices attached to the SOM during \npower-up, or power–down. These voltages ca n cause a current flow into the controller \nespecially if peripheral devices attached to the interfaces of the i.MX 6UL/ULL are \nsupposed to be powered while the phyCOR E-i.MX 6UL/ULL is in suspend mode, or \nturned off. To avoid this the X_nRESET_OUT or X_PMIC_STBY_REQ signal (section 4.4) \nmust be used to control the output enable  of any driving peripheral components \nconnected to the SOM. If the same voltag e supply for the baseboard peripherals and \nthe SOM is used (e.g. VCC3V3), there is no need to take care of unintended current flow \ninto the SOM, since the voltages of the Peripherals and the SOM will be switched \nsimultaneously. \n \nNote: \n\uf0b7 Most of the controller pins have multiple mu ltiplexed functions. As most of these pins \nare connected directly to the phyCORE-Connector the alternative functions are \navailable by using the i.MX 6UL/ULL\'s pin muxing options. Signal descriptions in  Table \n4 however, are in regard to the specification of the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL and the \nfunctions defined therein. Please refer to the i.MX 6UL/ULL Reference Manual, or the \nschematic to get to know about alternative fu nctions. In order to utilize a specific pin\'s \nalternative function the corresponding re gisters must be configured within the \nappropriate driver of the BSP. \n\uf0b7 The following tables describe the full set of signals available at the phyCORE-Connector \naccording to the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL specification. However, the availability of \nsome interfaces (e.g. LCD) is controller-specific and therefore order-specific. Thus, \nsome signals might not be available on your module. \n\uf0b7 If the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL is delivered with a carrier board (e.g. the \nphyBOARD-Segin i.MX 6UL/ULL) the pin muxing might be changed within the \nappropriate BSP in order to support all featur es of the carrier boar d.

On-board switching regulators gene rate the DDR3L voltage 1.35 V and the core \nvoltage 1.4 V which is switchable  to 1.3 V or 0.925 V for power saving reasons. \n \nFor proper operation the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL must be supplied with a voltage source of  \n3.3 V \uf0b15 % at the VCC pins on the phyCORE-Connector X1. \n VDD_3V3: X1 90, 91, 92, 93 \n \nConnect all +3.3 V VCC input pins to your powe r supply and at least the matching number of \nGND pins. \n Corresponding GND: X1 1, 32, 62, 89  Please refer to section 2 for information on addition al GND Pins located at the \nphyCORE-Connector X1.   \nScenario Mean \ncurrent Peak \ncurrent Mean power \nconsumption \n1) During boot  290 mA  \n2) Idle-mode in Linux without ETH 132 mA 170 mA 0.436 W \n3) Idle-mode in Linux with ETH 156 mA 190 mA 0.515 W \n4) Idle with following 100 % CPU      load without ETH  214 mA  \n5) 100 % CPU load without EHT 175 mA 214 mA 0.578 W \n6) 100 % CPU load with ETH 199 mA 234 mA 0.657 W \n7) Full load with several tasks 290 mA 345 mA 0.957 W \n8) Suspend mem without ETH 43 mA 72 mA 0.142 W \n9) Suspend mem with ETH 49 mA 78 mA 0.162 W \n10) Suspend standby with ETH 60 mA 90 mA 0.198 W \n11) Suspend freeze with ETH 98 mA 126 mA 0.323 W \nTable 6: Current Consumption \n \n Power   \n  \n\uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2 19 The above values in Table 6 are to be seen as an orientation for dimensioning the power \nsupply of the SOM.  In order to ensure proper  functionality of the SOM we recommend that \nthe power supply is design to provide\n appr oximately 20 % higher currents. We also \nrecommend that the final application is revalid ated in regards of adequate current supply \nusing application specific use case scenarios.   \nCaution! \nAs a general design rule we recommend connecting all GND pins neighboring signals which \nare being used in the application circuitry . For maximum EMI performance all GND pins \nshould be connected to a solid ground plane. \n4.2 Voltage Regulator (U4)  \nThe phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL provides an on-board dual output step-down DC-to-DC converter at position U4 to generate two voltages required by the microcontroller and the \non-board components.  \n4.3 Power Domains \nExternal voltages: \n\uf0b7 VDD_3V3 3.3 V main supply voltage \n\uf0b7 X_USB_OTG1_VBUS USB1 Bus voltage, must be supplied with 5 V if USB1 is used \n\uf0b7 X_USB_OTG2_VBUS USB2 Bus voltage, must be supplied with 5 V if USB2 is used \n\uf0b7 VDD_SNVS Backup supply (isolate d from VDD_3V3 by diode D1) \n \nInternally generated voltages: VDD_ARM_SOC (1.4 V, 1.3 V, 0.925) and VDD_DDR3_1V35 \n(1.35 V).  \n\uf0b7 VDD_ARM_SOC: i.MX 6UL/ULL Core and SOC voltage is switchable from 1.4 V to\n 1.3 V and 0.925 V \n\uf0b7 VDD_DDR3_1V35: i.MX 6UL/ULL DDR interface (NVCC_DRAM), RAM devices (1.35 V) diode D1) \n\uf0b7 VDD_SNVS: i.MX 6UL/ULL backup supply (isolated from VDD_3V3 over by  \n(3.3 V) \n\uf0b7 VDD_3V3: i.MX 6UL/ULL pad supply (VDD_HIGH_IN, VDD_ADC_3P3NVCC, \n(3.3 V) ADC_VREFH, NVCC_UART, NVCC_NAND, NVCC_SD1, NVCC_GPIO, \n NVCC_LCD, NVCC_CSI, NVCC_ENET), Voltage supervisor, \n I\n2C EEPROM, NAND Flash, Ethernet PHY  \nphyCORE®-i.MX 6UL/ULL [PCL-063]   \n  \n20 \uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2 4.4 Switching Supply Voltag es for external Logic \nThe phyCORE’s logic circuitry is directly supplied from the module\'s main input voltage \nVDD_3V3 (3.3 V). If the external components on a customer base board are supplied with \nthe same 3.3 V source as the module, there is  no need for special power-up or power-down \nsequences. Otherwise it is mandatory for the i.MX 6UL/ULL that external devices are supplied later than the module itself. Please use signal X_PMIC_STBY_REQ or X_RESET_OUT \nwhich is brought out at pin 102 on the phyCORE connector X1 to switch supply voltages on \na carrier board. Use of X_PMIC_STBY_REQ or X_RESET_OUT ensures that external components are only supplied when the supply voltages of the i.MX 6UL/ULL are stable.  \nThat way, voltages at the IO pins of the ph yCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL which are sourced from the \nsupply voltage of peripheral devices attached to the SOM are avoided. These voltages can \ncause a current flow into the controller especi ally if peripheral devices attached to the \ninterfaces of the i.MX 6UL/ULL are supposed to be powered while the \nphyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL is in suspend mode, or turned off. The bus switches\' output enable to the SOM can be controlled by signals X_ PMIC_STBY_REQ or X_RESET_OUT to prevent \nthese voltages from occurring.  Use of level shifters supplied with voltages switched by the signals X_PMIC_STBY_REQ, or X_RESET_OUT allows converting the signals a ccording to the needs on the custom target \nhardware. Alternatively signals can be connect ed to an open drain circuitry with a pull-up \nresistor attached to VDD_3V3. \n4.5 Backup Power (VDD_SNVS) \nTo backup the i.MX 6UL/ULL\'s low power domain (SNVS_LP) and its RTC, a secondary voltage source of 2.4 V to 3.6 V can be attach ed to the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL at pin 94 of \nX1. VDD_SNVS is supplied by VDD_3V3 over diode D1 to if no backup supply is available. If \na backup supply is connected to pin 94 of X1 diode D1 ensures that only VDD_SNVS_IN is \nsupplied when the primary system power (VDD_3V3) is removed.  \nNote: \nIf a non rechargeable source is used a diode should be placed in the VDD_SNVS path on the \ncarrier board! \n Reset   \n  \n\uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2 21 5 Reset \nPin 98 at X1 on the phyCORE-Connector is designated as reset output. \nPin 100 at X1 on the phyCORE-Connector is designated as reset input. \n The reset input signal X_nRESET_IN is connect ed to the voltage supervisor U5 on the \nphyCORE module. This device monitors the VDD_3V3 input voltage and reacts on other \nreset triggers, e.g. of an external button, too. The reset delay time is typ. 200 ms.  \n \nThe reset output signal X_nRESET_OUT is br ought out to allow resetting devices on the \ncarrier board.

Hence leaving the two pins un connected sets the controller to boot mode \n2, internal boot. \n                                                   \n12: Default boot mode when pins X_BOOT_MODE[1:0] are left unconnected.

Please refer to the i.MX 6UL/ULL Reference Manual  for more information. \n \nIn boot mode 0 and 2 the ROM code finds the bootstrap in permanent memories such as \nNAND-Flash or SD-Cards and executes it. The selection of the boot device and the configuration of the interface required are accomplished with the help of the eFUSEs and/or the corresponding GPIO input pins. \n6.2 Boot Device Selection and Configuration \nIn normal operation (boot mode 0, or 2), the boot ROM uses the state of BOOT_MODE and \neFUSEs to determine the boot device.   During development it is advisable to  set the boot type to “Internal boot” \n(BOOT_MODE[1:0]=10\n12 to allow choosing and configuring the boot device by using GPIO \npin inputs. The input pins are sampled at boot, and override the values of the \ncorresponding eFUSEs BOOT_CFGx[7:0], if the BT_FUSE_SEL fuse is not blown. \n \nTable 8  lists the eFUSEs BOOT_C FGx[7:0] an d the corresponding input pins.  \n \nCaution! \n\uf0b7 The boot mode configuration resistors must  be placed on the carrier board for \ndevelopment! Later on if the eFUSEs ar e used the resistors can be unpopulated. \n \nTable 8  lists the eFUSEs BOOT_CFGx[7:0] and the corresponding input pins. \n \nUse 10 kΩ pull-up and pull-down resistors on the carrier board to configure eFUSEs \nBOOT_CFGx[7:0] in accordance with the module features. Table 9  shows some \navailable options for the boot configuration. \n\uf0b7 Please make sure that the signals shown in  Table 8 are not dri ven by any device on \nthe baseboard during reset, to avoid accidental change of the boot configuration. \n \nBecause of this, we recommend to boot fr om eFUSE for volume production and use \nonly internal boot mode for development process13. \n \nPlease refer to the i.MX 6UL/ULL Reference Manual  for further information about the \neFUSEs and the impact of the settings at the BCFG pins. \n                                                   \n13: For series production  Phytec offers to order the phyCOR E-i.MX 6UL/ULL with a custom configuration of the eFUSEs  \nphyCORE®-i.MX 6UL/ULL [PCL-063]   \n  \n24 \uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2  \nConfiguration \nPin Pin # Signal ST SL Description \nBCFG1[0] 25 X_LCD_D0 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_00 \nBCFG1[1] 26 X_LCD_D1 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_01 \nBCFG1[2] 27 X_LCD_D2 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_02 \nBCFG1[3] 28 X_LCD_D3 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_03 \nBCFG1[4] 29 X_LCD_D4 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_04 \nBCFG1[5] 30 X_LCD_D5 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_05 \nBCFG1[6] 31 X_LCD_D6 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_06 \nBCFG1[7] 33 X_LCD_D7 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_07 \nBCFG2[0] 34 X_LCD_D8 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_08 \nBCFG2[1] 35 X_LCD_D9 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_09 \nBCFG2[2] 36 X_LCD_D10 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_10 \nBCFG2[3] 37 X_LCD_D11 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_11 \nBCFG2[4] 38 X_LCD_D12 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_12 \nBCFG2[5] 39 X_LCD_D13 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_13 \nBCFG2[6] 40 X_LCD_D14 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_14 \nBCFG2[7] 41 X_LCD_D15 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_15 \nBCFG4[0] 42 X_LCD_D16 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_16 \nBCFG4[1] 43 X_LCD_D17 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_17 \nBCFG4[2] 44 X_LCD_D18 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_18 \nBCFG4[3] 45 X_LCD_D19 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_19 \nBCFG4[4] 46 X_LCD_D20 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_20 \nBCFG4[5] 47 X_LCD_D21 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_21 \nBCFG4[6] 48 X_LCD_D22 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_22 \nBCFG4[7] 49 X_LCD_D23 I 3.3 V LCD_DATA_23 \nTable 8: Boot Configuration Pins at the phyCORE-Connector \n \nBoot Configuration BCFG1 [7:0] BCFG2 [7:0] BCFG4 [7:0] \nNAND 1Gb (64 pages p. \nblock, 4 address bytes) 10010010 00000000 00000000 \nNAND 4Gb (64 pages p. block, 5 address bytes) 10010011 00000000 00000000 \nSD-Card 01000010 00100000 00000000 \nTable 9:  Options for the Boot Configuration \n System Memory   \n  \n\uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2 25 7 System Memory \nThe phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL provides three types of on-board memory: \n \n\uf0b7 DDR3 SDRAM: 128 GB DDR3 SDRAM (up to 2 GB)14 \n\uf0b7 NAND Flash: 128 MB (up to 2 GB)14, \n\uf0b7 I²C-EEPROM: 4 kB14 \n \nThe following sections of this chapter detail each memory type used on the \nphyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL. \n7.1 DDR3-SDRAM (U6) \nThe RAM memory of the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL is comprised of one 16-bit wide DDR3-SDRAM chip (U6). The chip is connected to the special DDR interface called Multi Mode DDR Controller (MMDC) of the i.MX 6UL/ULL microcontroller.  \nThe DDR3 memory is accessible st arting at address 0x8000 0000. \n \nTypically the DDR3-SDRAM initialization is perf ormed by a boot loader or operating system \nfollowing a power-on reset and must not be ch anged at a later point by any application \ncode. When writing custom code independent of an operating system or boot loader, the \nSDRAM must be initialized by accessing the appropriate SDRAM configuration registers on \nthe i.MX 6UL/ULL controller.

No dedicated programming voltage is \nrequired.  As of the printing of this manual these NAND  Flash devices generally have a life expectancy \nof at least 100,000 erase/program cycles and a data retention rate of 10 years.  Any parts that are footprint (VFBGA-N63) and functionally compatible may be used with the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL. \n7.3 I²C EEPROM (U3) \nThe phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL is populated with a non-volatile 4 kB I2C15 EEPROM at U3. This \nmemory can be used to store configuration data or other general purpose data. This device \nis accessed through I2C port 1 on the i.MX 6UL/ULL. The control registers for I2C port 1 are \nmapped between addresses 0x021A 0000  and 0x021A 3FFF. Please see the i.MX 6UL/ULL \nReference Manual  for detailed information on the registers. \n \nOne solder jumper J10 is provided to conf igure chip enable signal E1 which allows \nchanging the address for the memory area, as well as for the additional ID page. Refer to \nsection 7.3.1  for detai ls on setting this jumper. \n \nWrite protection to the device is accomplished by a high level on signal Write Control when \nresistor R102 is removed. If resistor R101 is mounted write protection can also be changed \nby the EEPROM_WP signal16 (GPIO5_06).

It detects the \nTX and RX pins of the connected device and automatically configures the PHY TX and RX \npins accordingly. The Ethernet PHY also feat ures an Auto-negotiation to automatically \ndetermine the best speed and duplex mode.  The Ethernet PHY is connected to the ENET1 RMII interface of the i.MX 6UL/ULL. Please \nrefer to the i.MX 6UL/ULL Reference Manual  for more information about this interface. \n In order to connect the module to an exis ting 10/100 Base-T network some external \ncircuitry is required. The required terminatio n resistors on the analog signals (ETH1_A±, \nETH1_B±) are integrated in the chip, so there is no need to connect external termination \nresistors to these signals. Connection to an external Ethernet magnetics should be done using very short signal traces. The A+/A- an d B+/B- signals should be routed as 100 Ohm \ndifferential pairs. The same applies for the si gnal lines after the transformer circuit. The \ncarrier board layout should avoid any other si gnal lines crossing the Ethernet signals. \nphyCORE®-i.MX 6UL/ULL [PCL-063]   \n  \n32 \uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2  \nCaution! \nPlease see the datasheet of the Ethernet PHY when designing the Ethernet transformer \ncircuitry, or request the schematic of the applicable carrier board \n(phyBOARD-Segin i.MX 6UL/ULL) as reference. \n9.3.2  MAC Address \nIn a computer network such as a local area network (LAN), the MAC (Media Access Control)\n \naddress is a unique computer hardware number .

Should this nonetheless be \nnecessary, please ensure that the board as well as surrounding components and sockets remain undamaged while de-soldering. Overheating the board can cause the solder pads \nto loosen, rendering the module inoperable. Carefully heat neighboring connections in \npairs. After a few alternations, components can be removed with the solder-iron tip. \nAlternatively, a hot air gun can be used to heat and loosen the bonds. \n \nCaution! \nIf any modifications to the module are pe rformed, regardless of their nature, the \nmanufacturer guarantee is voided. \n \n Handling the phyCORE-i.MX 6UL/ULL   \n  \n\uf0e3 PHYTEC Messtechnik GmbH 2017     L-827e_2 51 \uf0b7 Integrating the phyCORE into a Target Application \nSuccessful integration in user target circui try greatly depends on the adherence to the \nlayout design rules for the GND connections of the phyCORE module. For maximum EMI \nperformance we recommend as a general design  rule to connect all GND pins to a solid \nground plane.
