The part operates from a single \n2.7 V to 5.25 V power supply and features throughput ra tes up \nto 1 MSPS. The part contains a low noise, wide bandwidt h \ntrack -and-hold amplifier that can handle input frequencies in \nexcess of 1 MHz.  \nThe conversion process and data acquis ition are controlled \nusing CS and the serial clock signal , allowing the device to \neasily interface with microprocessors  or DSP s. The input signal \nis sampled on the falling edge of CS, and conversion is also \ninitiated at this point. There are no pipeline delays associated \nwith the part.  \nThe AD74 90 uses advanced design techniques to achieve very \nlow power d issipat ion at high throughput rates. For maximum \nthroughput rates, the AD7490 consumes just 1.8 mA with 3 V supplies, a nd 2.5 mA with 5 V supplies.  \nBy setting the relevant bits in the control register, the analog \ninput range for the part can be selected to  be a 0 V to REF\nIN \ninput or a 0  V to 2 × REF IN input, with either straight binary  \nor twos complement output coding. Th e AD7490 features 16 \nsingle -ended analog inputs with a channel sequencer to  allow a \npreprogrammed selection of channels to be converted s equen-\ntially. The conversion time is determined by the SCLK frequency because  this is also used as the master clock to \ncontrol the conversion.  \nThe AD7490 is available in a 32 -lead LFCSP  and a 2 8-lead \nTSSOP package.  \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS  \n1. The AD7490 offers up to 1 MSPS throughput rates. At \nmaximum throughput with 3 V supplies, the AD7490 \ndissipates just 5.4 mW of power.  \n2. A sequ ence of channels can be selected, through which the \nAD7490 cycle s and conve rts. \n3. The AD7490 operates from a single 2.7 V to 5.25 V supp ly. \nThe V DRIVE  function allows the serial interface to connect \ndirectly to either 3 V or 5 V processor systems independent \nof V DD. \n4. The conversion rate is determined by the serial clock, \nallowing th e conversion time to be reduced through the \nserial clock sp eed increase. The part also features various \nshutdown modes to maximize power efficiency at lower \nthroughput rates. Power consumption is 0.5 µ A, maximum, \nwhen in full shutdown.  \n5. The part features a  standard successive  approximation \nADC with accurate contro l of the sampling instant via a CS \ninput and once off conversion control.  \n \n \nAD7490  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

All input signals are specified with t R = t F = 5 ns (10% to 90% of V DD) and  timed f rom a voltage level of 1.6 V (s ee Figure 2). The 3 V \noper ating  range  spans from 2.7 V to 3.6 V. The 5 V oper ating range spans from 4.75 V to 5.25 V.  \n2 The m ark/ space ratio for the SCLK input is 40/60 to 60/40. The maximum SCL K frequency is 16 MHz with V DD = 3 V to give a thro ughput of 87 0 kSPS. Care must  be \ntake n whe n inte rfacing to account for data access time , t4, and the setup time required for the user’s processor. These two times determine the maximum SCLK \nfrequency with wh ich the user’s system ca n operate (see the Serial Interface  secti on). \n3 Measured with the load circuit of Figure 2 and defined as the time required for the output to cross 0.4 V o r 0.7 V DRIVE . \n4 t3b repre sents a worst- case figure for having ADD3 availab le on the DO UT line, that is , if the AD749 0 goes  back into three -state at the end of a c onversion and some \nother device t akes control of the bus between conversions, the user has  to wait a maximum time of t 3b before having ADD3 valid on the DOUT line. If t he DOUT line  is \nweakly driven  to ADD3  betw een conversions, the user typically has  to wai t 17 ns at 3 V and 12 ns at 5 V a fter the CS falling edge before seeing ADD3 valid on DOUT.  \n5 t8 is derived from the measured time taken by the data o utputs to cha nge 0.5 V when l oaded wi th the circ uit of Figure 2. The measured number is then extrap olated \nback to remove the effects of charging or discharging the 25 pF capacitor.  This means that the time, t 8, quoted in the timing  characteris tics, is the true bus relinqui sh \ntime of the part and is independent of the bus loading.  \n \n02691-002200µ A IOL\n200µ A IOH1.6VTO OUTPUT\nPINCL\n25pF\n \nFigure 2.

This inp ut provides the dual function of initiating \nconversions on the AD7490 and also fr ames the serial data transfer.  \n23 21 REF IN  Reference Input for the AD7490. An external refe rence must be applied to this input. The \nvoltage range for the external reference is 2.5 V ± 1% for specified performance.  \n22 20 V DD  Power Supply Input. The V DD range for the AD7490 is from 2.7 V to 5.25 V. For the 0 V to 2 × REF IN \nrange, V DD should be from 4.75 V to 5.25 V.  \n14, 21, 24 12, 19, 22 AGND  Analog Ground.

Sixteen  single-ended analog input channels that are \nmultiplexed into the on chip track-and-hold. The analog input channel to be converted is \nselected by using the address bits ADD3 through ADD0 of the control register. The address bits, \nin conjunction with the SEQ and SHADOW bits, a llow the sequence register to be programmed. \nThe input range for all input channels can extend from 0 V to REF IN or 0 V to 2 × REF IN as selected \nvia the RANGE bit in the control register. Any unused input channels should be connected to \nAGND to avoid noise pickup.  \n19 17 DIN  Data In. Logic input. Data to be written to the control register of the AD7490 is provided on this \ninput and is clocked into the register on the falling edge of SCLK (see the Control Register \nsection).  \n15 13 DOUT  Data Out. Logic output. The conversion result from the AD7490 is provided on this output as a \nserial data stream. The bits are clocked out on the falling edge of the SCLK input. The data \nstream consists of four address bits indicating which channel the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 12 bits of conversion data, which is provided by MSB first. The output coding \ncan be selected as straight binary or twos complement via the CODING bit in the control \nregister.  \n16 14 SCLK  Serial Clock. Logic input.

E | Page 10 of 28 TERMINOLOGY  \nIntegral Nonlinearity  \nThis is the maximum deviation from a straight line passing \nthrough the en dpoints of t he ADC tran sfer function. The end -\npoints of the transfer function are ze ro scale, a point 1 LSB \nbelow the first code transitio n, and full scale, a point 1 LSB  \nabove the las t code transition.  \nDifferential Non linearity  \nThis is the difference betw een the meas ured and th e ideal 1 LSB \nchange between any two adjacent codes in the AD C. \nOffset Error \nThis is t he devia tion of the first cod e transition (00  … 000) to \n(00 … 001) from the  ideal,  that is, AGND + 1 LSB.  \nOffs et Error Mat ch \nThis is the difference  in offset e rror betwee n any two channels.  \nGain Error  \nThis is the deviation of the l ast code transition (111 … 110) t o \n(111 … 111) from th e ideal (that is, REF IN − 1 LSB) after the \noffset error has been adjusted out.  \nGain  Error Mat ch \nThis is the difference  in gain err or between an y two channels.  \nZero Code Error This applies when using the twos complement output coding option, in particular t o the 2 × REF\nIN input ra nge with − REF IN \nto +REF IN biased about the REF IN point. It i s the deviation of the \nmidscale tr ansition (al l 0s to all 1s) from the ideal V IN voltage, \nthat is, REF IN − 1 LSB.  \nZero Code Error Match  \nThis is the dif ference in zero code error between any two \nchannels.  \nPositive Gain Error  \nThis applies when using the two s compleme nt output coding \noption, in particula r the 2 × R EF IN input range with − REF IN to \n+REF IN biased about the REF IN point. It is the deviation of th e \nlast code transitio n (011 … 110) to (011 … 111) from the ideal \n(that is, + REF IN − 1 LSB) after the zer o code err or has been \nadjusted out.  \nPositive Ga in Error Ma tch \nThis is the difference in positive gain error between any two channels.  \nNegative Gain Erro r \nThis applies when u sing the twos complement  output coding \noption, in particular to the 2 × REF\nIN input  range wit h −REF IN \nto +REF IN biased  about the REF IN point.  It is the deviation of the \nfirst code transition (100 … 000) to (100 … 001) from the ideal (that is, − REF\nIN + 1 LS B) after the zero code error has been \nadjusted out.  Negative Gain Error Match  \nThis is the diff erence in negative gain  error betwe en any two \nchannels.  \nChannel -to-Channel Isolation  \nChannel -to-channel isolation is a measure of the level of  \ncrosstalk between channels. It is measured  by applying a full -\nscale 400 kHz sine wave signal to all 15 nonselecte d input \nchannels and de termining ho w much that  signal is attenuated in \nthe selected channel with a 50 kHz signal. This specification is the worst case across all  16 channels for the AD7 490. \nPSR (Power Supply Rejection)  \nVariations in power supply affect the  full scale tr ansition,  but \nnot the  converter  linearity. Power supply rejection is the \nmaximum change in the full -scale transition point due  to a \nchange in power  supply voltage from the  nominal value. (see \nthe \nTypical P erformance Characteristics  section). \nTrack -and-Hold Acquisition Time  \nThe track -and-hold amplifier returns into track on the 14th \nSCLK fa lling edge. Track -and-hold acquisition time is the \nminimum time required for the track- and-hold amplifier to \nremain in track mode for its o utput to rea ch and sett le to within \n±1 LSB of the applied input signal, given a step change to the \ninput signal.  \nSign al-to-Noise -and -Distor tion  (SINAD ) Ratio  \nThis  is the measured ratio of signal to (noise + distortion) at the \noutput of the a nalog -to-digita l converter.  The sig nal is the rm s \namplitude of the fundamental. Noise is the sum of all nonfunda -\nmental signals  up to half t he sampling frequency  (fS/2), excludi ng \ndc. The ratio is dependent on the number of quantization levels in the digit ization process ; the more l evels, the smaller the quan -\ntization noise. The theoretical signal -to-(noise + distortion ) ratio  \nfor an ideal N- bit converter with a s ine wave input i s given by  \nSignal -to-(Noise + Distortion)  (dB) = 6.02N  + 1.76  \nThus for a 12 -bit converter, thi s is 74 dB.  \nTotal Ha rmonic Dist ortion  \nTotal harmonic distortion (THD) is the ratio of the rms sum of \nharmonics to the fundame ntal. For the AD7490,  it is defined a s \n()\n16 5 4 3 2\nVV V V V VTHD2 2 2 2 2\nlog 20 dB++++×=  \nwhere V1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental and V 2, V3, \nV4, V 5, and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second through the \nsixth harmonics.  \nData Sheet AD7490  \n \nRev. E | Page 11 of 28 Peak Harmonic or Spurious Noise  \nPeak harmonic or s purious noise is defined as the ratio  of the \nrms value of the next largest component in the ADC output \nspectrum (up to f S/2 and exc luding dc) t o the rm s value of th e \nfundamental. Normally, the value of this specification is determined by the largest harmon ic in the spectrum, b ut for \nADCs wher e the ha rmonics are buried in the noise floor, it is a \nnoise peak.  \nIntermodulat ion Distortion  \nWith inputs consisti ng of sine wa ves at two frequencies, fa  \nand fb, any active device with nonlinearities creates distortion  \nproducts at the sum and difference f requenci es of mfa ±  nfb, \nwhere m, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Intermodulation di stortion \nterms are those fo r which neither m n or n are equal to zero.  For example, the second order terms include (fa + fb) and  \n(fa − fb),  while the third order terms include (2fa + fb), (2fa − fb),  \n(fa + 2fb) and (fa − 2fb).  \nThe AD7490 is tested using the CCIF standard where two input \nfrequencies near the top end of the input bandwidth are used. \nIn this case, the second order terms ar e usua lly distanced in \nfrequency from the original sine waves , and the third order \nterms are usually at a frequency close to the input frequencies. As a result, the second and third order terms are specified separately. The calculation of the intermodulati on dis tortion is \nper the THD specification, where it is the ratio of the rms sum \nof the individual distortion products to the rms amplitude of \nthe sum of the fundamentals expressed in decibels . \n \nAD7490  Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 12 of 28 INTERNAL REGISTER STRUCTURE  \nCONTROL REGISTER  \nThe control re gister  on the AD7490 is a 12- bit, write -only \nregister. Data is loaded from the DIN pin of the AD7490 on the \nfalling edge of SCLK. The data is transferred on the DIN line at the same time as the conversion result is read from the part. \nThe data transferred on the  DIN line corresponds to the AD7490 configuration for the next conversion. This requires  \n16 serial clocks for every data transfer. Only the information \nprovided on the first 12 falling clock edges (after the \nCS falling \nedge) i s load ed to the control register. MSB denotes the first bit \nin the data stream. The bit functions are outlined in Table 8. \nTable 8.

Control Register Bit Functions \nBit Name Description  \n11 WRITE  The value written to this bit of the control register determines whether t he following 11 bits are loaded to the \ncontrol register or not. If this bit is a 1, the following 11 bits are  written to the control register; if it is a 0, the \nremaining 11 bits are not loaded to the control register , and it remains unchanged.  \n10 SEQ  The SEQ bit in the control register is used in conjunction with the SHADOW bit to control the use of the sequencer \nfunction and access the Shadow register (see Table 12). \n9 to 6 ADD3  to \nADD0  These four address b its ar e loaded at the end of the present conversion sequence and select which analog input \nchannel is to be converted  on in the next serial transfer, or they may select the final channel in a consecutive \nsequence , as described in Table 9. The selected inpu t channe l is decoded as shown in Table 10. The next channel \nto be converted on is  selected by the mux on the 14th SCLK falling edge. The address bits corresponding to the \nconversion result are also output on DOUT pr ior t o the 12 bits of data (see the Serial Interface  section).  \n5, 4 PM1, PM0  Power management bits. These two bits decode the mode of operation of the AD7490, as shown in Table 11. \n3 SHADOW The SHADOW bit in the control register is used in conjunction with the SEQ bit to control the use of the sequencer \nfunction and access the Shadow register (see Table 12). \n2 WEAK/ TRI This bit selects the state of the DOUT line at the end of the current serial transfer. If it is set to 1, the DOUT line is  \nweakly driven to the ADD3 channel address bit of the ensuing conversion. If this bit is set to 0, DOUT returns to \nthree -stat e at the end of the serial transfer. See the Control Register  section for more details.  \n1 RANGE This bit selects the analog input range to be used on the AD7490. If it is set to 0, the analog input range extend s \nfrom 0 V to 2 × REF IN. If it is set to 1, the analog input range extend s from 0 V to REF IN (for the next conversion).  \nFor 0 V to 2 × REF IN, VDD = 4.75 V to 5.25 V.  \n0 CODING This bit selects the type of output coding  used by  the AD7490 for the conversion r esult. If this bit is set to 0, the \noutput coding for the part is twos complement. If this bit is set to 1, the output coding from the part is  straight \nbinary (for the next conversion).  \nData Sheet AD7490  \n \nRev. E | Page 13 of 28 Table 10.

Power Mode Selection  \nPM1  PM0  Mode  \n1  1  Normal operation.  In this mode, the AD7490 remains in full power mode , regardless of the stat us of any of the logic inputs. \nThis mode allows the fastest possible throughput rate from the AD7490.  \n1  0  Full shutdown.  In this m ode, the AD7490 is in full shut down mode, with all circuitry on the AD7490 powering down. The \nAD7490 retains the informati on in the control register while in full shutdown. The part remains in full shutdown until these \nbits are changed in the control register.  \n0  1  Auto shutdown.  In this mode, the AD7490 automatically enters shutdown mode at the end of each conversion when the \ncontr ol register is updated. Wake -up time from shutdown is 1 µs , and the user should ensure that 1 µs has elapsed before \nattempting to perform a valid conversion on the part in this mode.  \n0  0  Auto standby . In this standby mode, portions of the AD7 490 ar e powered down, but the on-chip bias generator remains \npowered up. This mode is similar to auto shutdown and allows the part to power up within one dummy cycle, that is,  1 µs \nwith a 20 MHz SCLK.  \n \nSequencer Operation  \nThe configuration of the SEQ and SHADO W bits in the control register allows the user to select a particular mode of operation of the \nsequencer function. Table 12 outlines the four modes of operation of the sequencer.  \nTable 12. Sequ ence Selection  \nSEQ  SHADOW  Sequence Type  \n0  0  This configuration means the sequence function is not used. The analog input channel selected for each individual \nconversion is determined by the contents of the channel address bits ADD0 through AD D3 in ea ch prior write \noperation. This mode of operation reflects the normal operation of a multichannel ADC, without the sequencer function being used, where each write to the AD7490 selects the next channel for conversion (s ee Figure 12).  \n0  1  This configuration selects the Shadow r egister for programming. After the write to the control register, the following \nwrite operation load s the contents of the Shadow r egister. This program s the sequence of channels to be conver ted on \ncontinuously with each successive valid CS falling edge  (see Shadow register , Table 13 and Figure 13). The channels \nselected need not  be cons ecutive.  \n1  0  If the SEQ and SHADOW bits are set in this way, the sequence function is not interrupted upon completion of the write  \noperation. This allows other bits in the control register to be altered while in a sequence without terminating t he cycle .  \n1  1  This configuration is used in conjunction with the ADD3 to ADD0 channel address bits to program continuous conversions on a consecutive sequence of channels from Channel 0 through to a selected final channel , as determined \nby the channel addres s bits in the control register ( see Figure 14).  \nAD7490 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 14 of 28 SHADOW REGISTER \nThe Shadow register on the AD7490 is a 16-bit, write-only \nregister. Data is loaded from the DIN pin of the AD7490 on the falling edge of SCLK. The data is transferred on the DIN line at the same time that a conversion result is read from the part. \nThis requires 16 serial falling edges for the data transfer. The \ninformation is clocked into the Shadow register, provided the SEQ and SHADOW bits are set to 0, 1, respectively, in the previous write to the control register. MSB denotes the first bit in the data stream. Each bit represents an analog input from Channel 0 through Channel 15. A sequence of channels can be \nselected through which the AD7490 cycles with each consecutive \nCS\n falling edge after the write to the Shadow register. To select a \nsequence of channels, the associated channel bit must be set for \neach analog input. The AD7490 continuously cycles through the selected channels in ascending order, beginning with the lowest channel, until a write operation occurs (that is, the WRITE bit is set to 1), with the SEQ and SHADOW bits configured in \nany way except 1, 0 (see Table 12). The bit functions are \noutlined in Table 13. \nFigure 12 reflects the normal operation of a multichannel ADC, \nwhere each serial transfer selects the next channel for conversion. In this mode of operation, the sequencer function is not used. \n02691-011DOUT: CONVERSION RESULT FROM\nPREVIOUSLY SELECTED CHANNEL ADD3 TOADD0\nDIN: WRITE TO CONTROL REGISTER,\nWRITE BIT = 1,\nSELECT CODING, RANGE,AND POWER MODE\nSELECT ADD3 TO ADD0  FOR CONVERSION,SEQ = SHADOW = 0DIN: WRITE TO CONTROL REGISTER,WRITE BIT = 1,\nSELECT CODING, RANGE, AND POWER MODE\nSELECT CHANNEL ADD3 TO ADD0 FORCONVERSION,SEQ = SHADOW = 0DUMMY CONVERSIONSDIN = ALL 1s\nCS\nCSWRITE BIT = 1,SEQ = SHADOW = 0POWER ON\n \nFigure 12.

E | Page 16 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION  \nThe AD7490 is a fast, 16- channel, 12 -bit, single -supply, analog -\nto-digital  converter. The parts can be operated from a 2.7  V to \n5.25 V supply. When operated from a 5 V supply and provided \nwith a 20 MHz clock, the AD7490 is capable of throughput rates \nof up to 1 MSPS.  \nThe AD7490 provides the user w ith an on -chip, track -and-hold \nADC and a serial interface housed in either a 28 -lead TSS OP or \n32-lead LFCSP package. The AD7490 has 16 single -ended input \nchannels with a channel sequencer, allowing the user to select a \nsequence of channels t hrough which the ADC can cycle with each  \nconsecutive CS falling edge. Th e serial  clock input accesses data \nfrom the part, controls the transfer of data written to the ADC, \nand provides the clock source for the successive approximation \nADC. The analog input range for the AD74790 is 0 V to REF IN \nor 0 V to 2 × REF IN, depending on the sta tus of Bit 1 in the \ncontrol register. For the 0 V to 2 × REF IN range, the part must be \noperated from a 4.75 V to 5.25 V supply.  \nThe AD7490 provides flexible power management options to \nallow the user to achieve the best power performance for a given throug hput rate. These options are selected by program -\nming the power management bits in the control register.  \nCONVERTER OPERATION  \nThe AD7490 is a 12- bit successive approximation ADC based \naround a capacitive DAC. The AD7490 can convert analog input sign als in t he range 0 V to REF\nIN or 0 V to 2 × REF IN. \nFigure 15 and Figure 16 show simplified schematics of the \nADC. The ADC comprises control logic, SAR, and a capacitive DAC, which ar e used to add and subtract fixed amounts of \ncharge from the sampling capacitor to bring the comparator \nback into a balanced condition. Figure 15 shows the ADC \nduring its acquisition phase. SW2 is closed and SW 1 is in  \nPosition A. The comparator is held in a balanced condition,  \nand the sampling capacitor acquires the signal on the selected \nV\nIN channel.  \nWhen the ADC starts a conversion (see Figure 16), SW2 open s \nand SW1 mo ves to Position B, causing the comparator to  become  \nunbalanced. The control logic and the capacitive DAC are used to add and subtract fixed amounts of charge from the sampling \ncapacitor to bring the comparator back into a balanced condi-\ntion. When the co mparator  is rebalanced, the c onversion is \ncomplete. The control logic generates the ADC output code. \nFigure 18 shows the ADC transfer function.  \n02691-014VIN0\nVIN15\nAGNDA\nBSW1\nSW24kΩ\nCOM PARATORCAPACITIVE\nDAC\nCONTRO L\nLOGIC\n \nFigure 15.

ADC Conversion Phase  \nAnalog Input  \nFigure 17 shows an equivalent circuit of the analog input struc -\nture of the AD7490. The two diodes, D1 and D2, provide ESD \nprotection for the analog inpu ts. Care  must be taken to ensure \nthat the analog input signal never exceeds the supply rails by more than 200 mV . This cause s these diodes to become forward \nbiased and to start conducting current into the substrate. The \nmaximum current these diodes can con duct wit hout causing \nirreversible damage to the part  is 10 mA . Capacitor C1 in Figure 17 \nis typically about 4 pF and can primarily be attributed to pin capacitance. Resistor R1 is a lumped component made up of the \non resis tance of a track- and-hold switch and includes the on \nresistance of the input multiplexer. The total resistance is  typically  \nabout 400 Ω.

Equivalent Analog Input Circuit  \nFor ac applications, removing high frequency components from the analog input signal is recommended by use of an RC low -\npass filter on the relevant analog input pin. In applications  where  \nharmonic distortion and  signal -to-noise ratio are critical, the \nanalog input should be driven from a low impedance source. \nLarge source impedances significantly affect the ac performance \nof the ADC. This may necessitate the use of an input buffer amplifier. The choice of the op am p is a function of the  particular  \napplication.  \nData Sheet AD7490  \n \nRev. E | Page 17 of 28 When no amplifier is used to drive the analog input, the source \nimpedance should be limited to low values. The maximum \nsource impedance depends on the amount of total harmonic distortion (THD) that can be t olerated . The THD increase s as \nthe source impedance increases, and performance degrade s (see \nFigure 9). \nADC TRANSFER FUNCTION  \nThe output coding of the AD7490 is either straight binary or twos complement depending on  the sta tus of the LSB \n(CODING  bit) in the control register. The designed code \ntransitions occur midway between successive LSB values ( that \nis, 1 LSB, 2 LSBs, and so on). The LSB size is equal to \nREF\nIN/4096. The ideal transfer characteristic for the AD7490 \nwhen st raight binary coding is selected is shown in Figure 18. 02691-017111...111\n111...110\n111...000\n000...010011...111\n000...001\n000...000\n0V1LSB +VREF – 1LSB1LSB = V REF/4096\nVREF IS EITHER REF IN OR 2 × REF INANALOG INPUT\n \nFigure 18.

E | Page 18 of 28 TYPICAL CONNECTION DIAGRAM  \nFigure 21 shows a typical connection diagram for the AD7490. \nIn this setup, the AGND pin is connected to the analog ground \nplane of the system. In Figure 21, REF IN is connected to a \ndecoupled 2.5 V supply from a reference source, the AD780, to \nprovide an analog input range of 0 V to 2.5 V (if the RANGE bit \nis 1) or 0 V to 5 V (if the RANGE bit is 0). Although the  AD7490  \nis connected to a V DD of 5 V , the serial interface is connected to \na 3 V microprocessor. The V DRIVE pin of the AD7490 is connected  \nto the same 3 V supply of the microprocessor to allow a 3 V logic interface (see the Digital Input  section). The conversion \nresult is output in a 16 -bit word. This 16 -bit data stream \nconsists of four address bits, indicating which channel the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 12 bits of conversion data. For applications wher e power consumption is \nof concern, the power -down modes should be used between \nconversions or bursts of several conversions to improve power performance (see the Modes of Operation  section).  \n02691-0200.1µF 10µF5V\nSUPP LY\nSERIA L\nINTER FACE\n3V\nSUPP LYµCONTROLLER/\nµPROCESSORAD7490\n0.1µF0.1µF0VTO REF IN\nAGNDSCLK\nDOUT\nCS\nDINVIN0VDD\nVDRIVE REF INVIN15\n10µF 2.5V\nAD780\n \nFigure 21. Typical Connection Diagram  \nAnalog Input Channels  \nAny one of 16 analog input channels can be selected for con ver-\nsion by programming the multiplexer with the ADD3 to ADD0 address bits in the control register. The channel configurations \nare sho wn in Table 10. The AD7490 can  also be configured to \nautomatically cycle through a number of channels , as selected. \nThe sequencer feature is accessed via the SEQ and SHADOW bits in the control register (see Table 12). The AD7490 can be \nprogrammed to continuously convert on a selection of channels in ascending order. The sequence of analog input channels to be converted on is selected through programming the relevant bits in the Shadow register (see  Table 13). The next serial transfer \nthen act s on the sequence programmed by executing a conver -\nsion on the lowest channel in the selection.  \nThe next serial transfer results in a conversion on  the next \nhighest channel in the sequence , and so on. It is not necessary \nto write to the control register once a sequencer operation has been initiated. The WRITE bit must be set to 0  or the DIN line tied low to ensure the control register is not acciden tally over -\nwritten or the sequence operation interrupted. If the control register is written to at any time during the sequence, it must be ensured that the SEQ and SHADOW  bits are set to 1, 0 to avoid \ninterrupting the automatic conversion sequence. This p attern \ncontinue s until such time as the AD7490 is written to and the \nSEQ and SHADOW  bits are configured with any bit  combination  \nexcept 1, 0. On completion of the sequence, the AD7490 sequencer return s to the first selected channel in the Shadow register a nd \ncommence s the sequence again , if uninterrupted.  \nRather than selecting a particular sequence of channels, a  number  \nof consecutive channels beginning with C hannel 0 can  also be \nprogrammed via the control register alone without needing to write to the Shad ow register. This is possible if the SEQ and \nSHADOW  bits are set to 1, 1. The ADD3 through ADD0  channel  \naddress bits then determine the final channel in the consecutive \nsequence. The next conversion is  on Channel 0, then Channel 1 , \nand so on until the chann el selected via the ADD3 through \nADD0 address bits is reached. The cycle begin s again on the \nnext serial transfer , provided the WRITE bit is set to low ; or, if \nhigh, that the SEQ and SHADOW  bits are set to 1, 0, then the \nADC continue s its preprogrammed au tomatic se quence uninter -\nrupted. Regardless of which channel selection method is used, the 16 -bit word output from the AD7490 during each conversion  \nalways contain s the channel address that the conversion result \ncorresponds to , followed by the 12 -bit conve rsion result (see the \nSerial Interface section).  \nDigital Input  \nThe digital inputs applied to the AD7490 are not limited by the maximum ratings that limit the analog inputs. Instead, the digital inputs applied can g o to 7 V and are not restricted by the \nV\nDD + 0.3 V limit as on the analog inputs.  \nAnother advantage of SCLK, DIN, and CS not being restricted \nby the V DD + 0.3 V limit is the fact that power supply sequencing  \nissues are avoided. If CS, DIN, or SCLK is  applied before V DD, \nthere is no risk of latch- up as there would be on the analog \ninputs if a signal greater than 0.3 V were  applied prior to V DD. \nVDRIVE  \nThe AD7490 also has the V DRIVE  feature. V DRIVE  controls the \nvoltage at which the serial interface operates. V DRIVE  allows the \nADC to easily interface to both 3 V and 5 V processors. For example, if the AD7490 is  operated with a V\nDD o f  5  V,  t h e  V DRIVE  \npin can be powered from a 3 V supply. The AD7490 has better \ndynamic  performance with a V DD of 5 V , while still being able  \nto interface to 3 V processors. Care should be taken to ensure that V\nDRIVE  does not exceed V DD by more than 0.3 V (see  the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  section ). \nData Sheet AD7490  \n \nRev. E | Page 19 of 28 Reference Section  \nAn external reference source should be used to supply the 2.5 V \nreference to the AD7490. Errors in the reference source result  \nin gain errors in the AD7490 transfer function and add to the specified full -scale errors of the  part. A capa citor of at least 0.1 µ F \nshould be placed on the REF\nIN pin. Suitable refer ence sources \nfor the AD7490 include the AD780, REF192, AD1582, ADR03, ADR381, ADR391, and ADR421.  \nIf 2.5 V is applied to the REF\nIN pin, the analog input range can \neither be 0 V to 2. 5 V or 0 V to 5 V , depending on the RANGE \nbit in the control register.  \nMODES OF OPERATION  \nThe AD7490 has a number of different modes of operation. These modes are designed to provide flexible power manage-ment options. These options can be chosen to optimiz e the \npower dissipation/throughput rate ratio for differing application requirements. The mode of operation of the AD7490 is  controlled  \nby the power management bits, PM1 and PM0, in the c ontrol \nregister, as detailed in  Table 10. When power supplies are first \napplied to the AD7490, care should be taken to ensure that the part is placed in the required mode of operation (see  the \nPowering Up the AD7490  section) . \nNormal Mode (P M1 = PM0 = 1)  \nThis mode is intended for the fastest throughput rate  performance  \nbecause  the user does not have to worry about any power -up \ntimes with the AD7490 remaining fully powered at all times. Figure 22 shows the general diagram of the operation of the \nAD7490 in this mode.  \n02691-021NOTES\n1. CONTRO L REGISTER D ATA IS LOADED ON FIRST 12 SCLK CYCLES\n2.

Normal Mode Operation  The conversion is initiated on the falling edge of CS, and the \ntrack -and-hold enter s hold mode , as described in th e Serial \nInterface section. The data presented to the AD7490 on the \nDIN line during the first 12 clock cycles of the data transfer is \nloaded  \nto the control register (provided the WRITE bit is 1). If data is \nto be written to the Shadow register (SEQ = 0, SHADOW = 1 \non previous write), data presented on the DIN line during the \nfirst 16 SCLK cycles is loaded into the Shadow register. The part \nremain s fully powered up in normal mode at the end of the \nconversion as lo ng as PM1 and PM0 are set to 1 in the write \ntransfer during that conversion. To ensure continued operation in normal mode, PM1 and PM0 are both loaded with 1 on every  \ndata transfer. Sixteen serial clock cycles are required to complete the conversion and ac cess the conversion result. The track -and-\nhold go es back into track on the 14\nth SCLK falling edge. CS may \nthen idle high until the next conversion or may idle low until \nsometime prior to the next conversion, (effectively idling CS low).  \nOnce a data transfer is complete (DOUT has returned to three -\nstate WEAK/ TRI bit = 0), another conversion can be initiated \nafter the quiet time, t QUIET , has elapsed by bringing CS low again.  \nFull Shu tdown (PM1 = 1, PM0 = 0)  \nIn this mode, all internal circuitry on the AD7490 is powered \ndown. The part retains information in the control register during full shutdown. The AD7490 remains in full shutdown until the power management bits in the control regis ter, PM1 \nand PM0, are changed.  \nIf a write to the control register occurs while the part is in  \nfull shutdown, with the power management bits changed to \nPM0 = PM1 = 1 (normal mode ), the part begin s to power up  \non the \nCS rising edge. Th e track -and- hold that was in hold \nwhile the part was in full shutdown return s to track on the 14th \nSCLK falling edge. \nTo ensure that the part is fully powered up, t POWER UP (t12) should \nelapse  before the next CS falling edge.

Figure 24 shows the general diagram of the operation of \nthe AD7490 in this mode.  \nIn shutdown mode,  all internal circuitry on the AD7490 is \npowered down. The part retains information in the control \nregister during shutdown. The AD7490 remains in shutdown \nuntil the next CS falling edge it receives. On this CS falling edge, \nthe track- and-hold that was on hold while the part was in shut-\ndown mode return s to track -and-hold. Wake -up time from auto \nshutdown is 1 µ s, and the user should ensure that 1 µ s elapse s \nbefore attempting a valid conversion . When running th e AD7490  \nwith a 20 MHz clock, one dummy cycle of 16 × SCLK should be \nsufficient to ensure the part is fully powered up. During this \ndummy cycle, the contents of the control register should remain \nunchanged; therefore , the WRITE bit should be 0 on the DIN \nline. This dummy cycle effectively halves the throughput rate of \nthe part, with every other conversion result being valid. In this \nmode, the power consumption of the part is greatly reduced with the part entering shutdown at the end of each conversion. \nWhen  the control register is programmed to move into auto \nshutdown, it does so at the end of the conversion. The user can \nmove the ADC in and out of the low power state by controlling \nthe \nCS signal.  Auto Standby (PM1 = PM0 = 0)  \nIn this m ode, the AD7490 automatically enters standby mode at \nthe end of each conversion when the control register is updated. \nFigure 25 shows the general diagram of the operation of the \nAD7490 in this mode. When the part is  in standby, portions of \nthe AD7490 are powered -down , but the on -chip bias generator \nremains powered up. The part retains information in the con trol \nregister during standby. The AD7490 remains in standby until it \nreceives the next CS falling edge. On this CS falling edge, the \ntrack -and-hold that was on hold while the part was in standby \nreturn s to track. Wake -up time from standby is 1 µ s; the user \nshould ensure that 1 µ s elapse s before attempting a valid conver -\nsion on the part in this mode. When running the  AD7490 with  \na 20 MHz cloc k, one dummy cycle of 16 × SCLK  should be \nsufficient to ensure the part is fully powered up. During this \ndummy cycle, the contents of the control register should remain \nunchanged ; therefore, the WRITE bit should be set to 0 on the \nDIN line. This dummy cycle effectively halves the throughput rate of the part with every other conversion result being valid. \nIn this mode, the power consumption of the part is greatly \nreduced with the part en tering standby at the end of each con -\nversion. When the control register is programmed to move into \nauto standby, it does so at the end of the conversion. The user can move the ADC in and out of the low power state by \ncontrolling the \nCS signal.  \n02691-023SCLK1 16 1 16 1 16\nDOUT\nDINCSDUMM Y CONVERSION\nCONTRO L REGISTER IS LOADED ON THE\nFIRST 12 CLOCKS, PM1 = 0, PM0 = 1CONTRO L REGISTER CONTENTS SHOULD\nNOT CHANGE, WRITE BIT = 0PART ENTERS\nSHUTDOWN ON CS\nRISING EDGE AS\nPM1 = 0, PM0 = 1PART IS FUL LY\nPOWERED U P\nTO KEE PPART IN THIS MODE, LOAD PM1 = 0, PM0 = 1\nIN CONTRO L REGISTER OR SET WRITE BIT = 0CHANNE L IDENTIFIER BITS + CONVERSION RESU LT\nDATA INTO CONTROL/SHADOW REGISTERCHANNE L IDENTIFIER BITS + CONVERSION RESU LT\nDATA INTO CONTROL/SHADOW REGISTERINVALID D ATAPART ENTERS\nSHUTDOWN ON CS\nRISING EDGE AS\nPM1 = 0, PM0 = 1PART BEGINS\nTO POWER\nUP ON CS\nFALLING EDGE\n \nFigure 24.

E | Page 21 of 28 Powering Up the AD7490 \nWhen supplies are first applied to the AD7490, the ADC may \npower up in any of the op erating modes of the part. To ensure \nthat the part is placed into the required operating mode, the user should perform a dummy cycle operation , as outlined in \nFigure 26. \nThe three dummy conversion operations outli ned in Figure 26 \nmust be performed to place the part into either of the auto  modes . \nThe first two conversions of this dummy cycle operation are performed with the DIN line tied high, and for the third conver -\nsion of the dummy cycle operation, the user should write the \ndesired control register configuration to the AD7490 to place \nthe part into the required auto mode. On the third \nCS rising \nedge after the supplies are applied, the control register con tains \nthe correct information and valid data result s from the next \nconversion.  Therefore, to ensure the part is placed into the correct operating \nmode when supplies are first applied to the AD7490, the user \nmust first issue two serial write operations with  the DIN line \ntied high. On the third conversion cycle, the user can then write \nto the control register to place the part into any of the operating \nmodes. The user should not write to the Shadow register until the fourth conversion cycle after the supplies  are applied to  \nthe ADC to guarantee  that the control register contains the \ncorrect data.  \nIf the user wishes to place the part into either normal mode or full shutdown mode, the second dummy cycle with DIN tied \nhigh can be omitted from the three dummy con version \noperation outlined in Figure 26. \n \n02691-025SCLK1 12 16 1 12 16 1 12 16\nDOUT\nDINCSDUMM Y CONVERSION DUMM Y CONVERSIONCORRECT VALUE IN CONTRO L\nREGISTER VALID D ATA FROM\nNEXT CONVERSION USER CAN\nWRITE TO SHADOW REGISTER\nIN NEXT CONVERSION\nINVALID D ATA INVALID D ATA INVALID D ATA\nDATA INTO CONTRO L\nCONTRO L REGISTER IS LOADED ON THE\nFIRST 12 CLOCK EDGESKEEP DIN LINE TIED HIGH FOR FIRST TWO DUMM Y CONVERSIONS\n \nFigure 26.

E | Page 22 of 28 SERIAL INTERFACE  \nFigure 27 shows the detailed timing diagram for serial  inter facing  \nto the AD7490. The serial clock provides the conversion clock \nand also controls the transfer of information to and from the AD7490 during each conversion.  \nThe \nCS signal in itiates the data transfer and conversion process. \nThe falling edge of CS puts the track- and-hold into hold mode \nand takes the bus out of three- state. The analog input is sampled \nat this point. The conversion is also initiated at this  point and \nrequires 16 SCLK cycles to complete. The track -and-hold goes \nback into track on the 14th SCLK falling edge , as shown in \nFigure 27 at point B, except when the write is to the Shadow \nregister, in which case  the track -and-hold does not return to \ntrack until the rising edge of CS, that is, Point C in Figure 28. \nOn the 16th SCLK falling edge, the DOUT line goes back into \nthree -state (assuming the W EAK/TRI bit is set to 0). Sixteen \nserial clock cycles are required to perform the conversion process and to access data from the AD7490. The 12 bits of conversion data are preceded by the four channel address bits , ADD3 to ADD0, iden tifying which channel the conversion \nresult corresponds to. \nCS going low allows  the ADD3 address \nbit to be read in by the microprocessor or DSP . The remaining \naddress bits and data bits are then clocked out by subsequent SCLK falling edge s, beginning with the second address bit , \nADD2. T hus, the first SCLK falling edge on the serial clock has \nthe ADD3 address bit provided and also clocks out address bit \nADD2. The final bit in the data transfer is valid on the 16\nth \nfalling edge, having been  clocked out on the previous (15th) \nfalling edge.  \nWriting information to the control register takes place on the \nfirst 12 falling edges of SCLK in a data transfer, assuming the \nMSB, that is, the WRITE bit, has been set to 1. If the control \nregister is prog rammed to use the Shadow register, writing \ninformation to the Shadow register takes place on all 16 SCLK \nfalling edges in the next serial transfer (see Figure 28). The \nShadow register is updated upon the rising edge  of CS, and the \ntrack -and-hold begins to track the first channel selected in the \nsequence.  \n \n02691-026SCLK\nDOUT\nDINCS\nWRITE SEQ ADD3 ADD2 ADD1 ADD0 DONTC DONTC DONTCADD2 ADD1 ADD0 DB11 DB10 DB2 DB1 DB0B\nt2\nt3bt31 2 3 4 5 6 13 14 15 16\nt9 t10 t8t4 t7t6\nt5 t11\ntQUIETtCONVERT\nTHREE-\nSTATETHREE-\nSTATEADD3 FOUR IDENTIFIC ATION BITS\n \nFigure 27.

E | Page 23 of 28 If the WEAK/ TRI bit in the control register is set to 1, instead of  \nreturning to true three -state on the 16th SCLK falling edge, the \nDOUT line is  pulled weakly to the logic level corresponding to \nADD3 of the next serial  transfer. This is done to ensure that the \nMSB of the next serial transfer is set up in time for the first \nSCLK falling edge after the CS falling edge. If the WEAK/ TRI bit \nis set to 0 and the DOUT line has been  in true three -state \nbetween conversions, the ADD3 address bit may not be set up \nin time for the DSP/microcontroller to clock it in successfully, \ndepending on the particular DSP or microcontroller interfacing to the AD7490. In this case, ADD3 would only be driven from \nthe falling edge of \nCS and must then be clocked in by the DSP \non the following falling edge of SCLK. However, if  the WEAK/  \nTRI bit is set to 1 , although DOUT is driven with the ADD3 \naddress bit since the last conversion, it is nevertheless so weakly \ndriven that another device may still take control of the bus. It \ndoes  not lead to a bus contention ( for example,  a 10 k Ω pull-up \nor pull -down resistor is sufficient to overdrive the logic level of \nADD3 between conversions) , and all 16 channels may be \nidentified. If this does happen and another d evice takes control \nof the bus , it is not guaranteed that DOUT will be f ully driven \nto ADD3 again in time for the read operation when control of \nthe bus is taken back.  \nThis is especially useful if using an automatic sequence mode to identify to which channel each result corresponds.  If only the \nfirst eight channels are in use,  Address Bit ADD3 does not need \nto be decoded, and whether it is successfully clocked in as a 1  \nor 0 does  not matter as long as it is still counted by the DSP/  \nmicro controller  as the MSB of the 16 -bit serial transfer.  \nPOWER vs.  THROUGHPUT RATE  \nBy operatin g the AD7490 in auto shutdown or auto standby \nmode, the average power consumption of the ADC decreases at lower throughput rates. Figure 29 shows that as the throughput \nrate is reduced, the part remains in shutdown state longer and \nthe average power consumption drops accordingly  over time . \nFor example , if the AD7490 is operated in a continuous \nsampling mode with a throughput rate of 100 kSPS and an \nSCLK of 20 MHz (V\nDD = 5 V), with PM1 = 0 and PM0 = 1 (that \nis, the de vice is in auto shutdown mode ), the power \nconsumption is calculated as shown in Equation 1.  \nThe maximum power dissipation during normal operation is \n12.5 mW (V DD = 5 V). If the power- up time from auto shut -\ndown is one dummy cycle, that is,  1 µs, and the re maining \nconversion time is another cycle , that is, 1 µs, then the AD7490 \ncan be said to dissipate 12.5 mW for 2 µ s during each conver -\nsion cycle. For the remainder of the conversion cycle, 8 µ s, the part remains in shutdown mode. The AD7490 can be said to \ndissipate 2.5 µ W for the remaining 8 µ s of the conversion cycle. \nIf the throughput rate is 100 kSPS, the cycle time is 10 µ s and \nthe average power dissipated during each cycle is  \nmW502.2 μW5.2108mW5.12102=×+ ×  (1) \nWhen operating the AD7490 in auto standby mode  (PM1 = \nPM0 = 0 at 5 V , 100 kSPS) , the AD7490 power dissipation is \ncalculated as shown in Equation 2.  \nThe maximum power dissipation is 12.5 mW at 5 V during \nnormal operation. Again the power -up time from auto standby \nis one dummy cycle, 1 µ s, and the remaini ng conversion time is \nanother dummy cycle, 1 µ s. The AD7490 dissipates 12.5 mW \nfor 2 µ s during each conversion cycle. For the remainder of the \nconversion cycle, 8 µ s, the part remains in standby mode, \ndissipating 480 µW for 8 µ s. If the throughput rate is 1 00 kSPS, \nthe cycle time is 10 µ s and the average power dissipated during \neach conversion cycle is   \n2812.5 mW 480 μW 2.884 mW10 10× +× =  (2) \nFigure 29 shows the power vs.  throughput rate when using both \nthe auto shutdown mode and auto standby mode with 5 V \nsupplies. At the lower throughput rates, power consumption for the auto shutdown mode is lower than that for the auto standby mode, with the AD7490 dissipating less power when in shut-\ndown compared to standby. As the throughput rate is increased, however, the part spends less time in power -down states; hence, \nthe difference in power dissipated is negligible between modes. For 3 V supplies, the power consumption of the AD7490 \ndecreases. Similar power calculations can be done at 3 V.  \n10\n0.010.11\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n02691-028 THROUGHPUT (kSPS)POWER (mV)VDD = 5V\nAUTO STANDB Y\nAUTO SHUTDOWN\n \nFigure 29.

E | Page 24 of 28 MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING  \nThe serial interface on the AD7490 allows the part to be directly \nconnected to a range of many different microprocessor s. This \nsection explains how to interface the AD7490 with some of the more common microcontroller and DSP serial interface \nprotocols.  \nAD7490 to TMS320C541  \nThe serial interface on the TMS320C541 uses a continuous  serial  \nclock and frame synchronization signa ls to synchronize the data \ntransfer operations with peripheral devices like the AD7490. \nThe CS input allows easy interfacing between the TMS320C541 \nand the AD7490 without any glue logic required. The serial port \nof the TMS320C541 is set up to operate in burst mode with \ninternal CLKX0 (TX serial clock on Serial Port 0) and FSX0 \n(TX frame sync from Serial Port 0). The serial port control register (SPC) must have the following setup: FO = 0, FSM = 1, MCM = 1, and TXM = 1. The connection diagram is shown in \nFigure 30. Note  that for signal processing applications, it is \nimperative that the frame synchronization signal from the TMS320C541 provide equidistant sampling. The V\nDRIVE  pin \n of the AD7490 tak es the same supply voltage as that of the \nTMS320C541. This allows the ADC to operate at a higher \nvoltage than the serial interface, that is , TMS320C541, if \nnecessary.  \n02691-029AD7490 TMS320C541*\nSCLK CLKX\nCLKR\nDR\nDT\nFSX\nFSRDOUT\nDIN\nCS\n*ADDITIONA L PINS REMOVED FOR CLARIT YVDRIVE\nVDD \nFigure 30. Interfacing to the TMS320C541  \nAD7490 to ADSP- 21xx  \nThe ADSP -21xx family of DSPs is interfaced directly to the \nAD7490 without any glue logic required. The V DRIVE  pin of the \nAD7490 takes the same supply voltage as that of the ADSP -\n218x.This allows the ADC to operate at a higher volt age than \nthe serial interfa ce, that is, ADSP -218x, if necessary.  \nThe SPORT0 control register should be set up as follows:  \n• TFSW = RFSW = 1, alternate framing  \n• INVRFS = INVTFS = 1, active low frame signal  \n• DTYPE = 00, right justify data  \n• SLEN = 1111, 16- bit data -words  \n• ISCLK = 1, internal serial clock  \n• TFSR = RFSR = 1, frame every word  \n• IRFS = 0 \n• ITFS = 1 The connection diagram is shown in Figure 31. The ADSP -218x \nhas the TFS and RFS of the SPORT tied together, with TFS set \nas an output and RFS set as an input. The DSP operates in \nalternate framing mode , and the SPORT control register is set \nup as described. The frame synchronization signal generated on \nthe TFS is tied to CS, and, as with all signal processing \napplications, equidistant sampling is necessary. In this example, \nhowever, the timer interrupt is used to control the sampling rate of the ADC, and under certain conditions, equidistant sampling \nmay not be achieved.  \nThe timer register , for example , is loaded with a value that  \nprovide s an interrupt at the required sample interval. When an \ninterrupt is received, a value is transmitted with TFS/DT (ADC \ncontrol word). The TFS is used to control the RFS and , thus , the \nreading of data. The frequency of the serial clock is set in the  \nSCLKDIV register. When the instructio n to transmit with TFS \nis given  (that is , AX0 = TX0), the state of the SCLK is checked. \nThe DSP waits until the SCLK has gone high, low , and high \nbefore transmission start s. If the timer and SCLK values are \nchosen such  that the instruction to transmit occurs on or near \nthe rising edge of SCLK, the data may be transmitted or it may \nwait until the next clock edge.  \nFor example, if the ADSP -2189 with a 20 MHz crystal has an \noverall master clock frequency of 40 MHz, then the  master \ncycle time is  25 ns. If the SCLKDIV register is loaded with a  \nvalue of 3, an SCLK of 5 MHz is obtained, and eight master \nclock periods elapse for every 1 SCLK period. Depending on the throughput rate selected, if the timer registers are loaded with  the value 803, 100.5 SCLKs occur between interrupts and \nsubsequently between transmit instructions. This situation results in nonequidistant sampling because  the transmit instruc -\ntion occurs on a SCLK edge. If the number of SCLKs between \ninterrupts is a f igure of N, equidistant sampling is implemented \nby the DSP .  \n02691-030AD7490 ADSP-218x*\nSCLK SCLK\nDR\nDTRFS\nTFSDOUT\nDINCS\n*ADDITIONA L PINS REMOVED FOR CLARIT YVDRIVE\nVDD \nFigure 31. Interfacing to the ADSP -218x  \nAD7490 to DSP563xx  \nThe connection diagram in Figure 32 shows how the AD7490 \ncan be conne cted to the ESSI (synchronous serial interface) of \nthe DSP563xx family of DSPs from Motorola. Each ESSI ( two \non board) is operated in synchronous mode ( the SYN bit in \nCRB = 1) with internally generated word length frame sync for both Tx and Rx (FSL1 = 0 an d FSL0 = 0 in CRB). Normal \noperation of the ESSI is selected by making MOD = 0 in the CRB.  \nData Sheet AD7490\n \nRev. E | Page 25 of 28 Set the word length to 16 by setting WL1 = 1 and WL0 = 0 in \nCRA. The FSP bit in the CRB should be set to 1 so the frame sync is negative. Note that for signal processing applications, it is imperative that the frame synchronization signal from the \nDSP563xx provide equidistant sampling. \n02691-031AD7490 DSP563xx*\nSRD DOUT\n*ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITYVDRIVESCLK SCK\nSC2 DIN\nVDDSTD CS\n \nFigure 32.

The AD7490 V\nDRIVE  pin takes the same supply voltage as \nthat of the DSP563xx. This allows the ADC to operate at a \nhigher voltage than the serial interface, that is, DSP563xx, if \nnecessary. \n \nAD7490  Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 26 of 28 APPLICATIONS  INFO RMATION  \nGROUNDING AND LAYOUT  \nThe AD7490 has very good immunity to noise on the power \nsupplies shown in  the PSRR vs. Supply Ripple Frequency plot, \nFigure 7. Care s hould stil l be taken, however, with regard to \ngrounding and layout.  \nThe printed circuit board that houses the AD7490 should be \ndesigned such that the analog and digital sections are separated \nand confined to certain areas of the board. This facilitates the  \nuse of ground planes that can be separated easily. A minimum \netch technique is generally best for ground planes because  it \ngives the best shielding. All three AGND pins of the AD7490 should be sunk in the AGND plane. Digital and analog ground planes should be joine d at only one place. If the AD7490 is in a \nsystem where multiple devices require an AGND to DGND connection , the connection should still be made at one point \nonly, a star ground point that  should be established as close as \npossible to the AD7490.  \nAvoid run ning digital lines under the device because  these \ncouple noise onto the die. The analog ground plane should be allowed to run under the AD7490 to avoid noise coupling. The \npower supply lines to the AD7490 should use as large a trace as \npossible t o provide low impedance paths and reduce the effects \nof glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals like \nclocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board, and clock signals should \nnever be run near t he analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital \nand analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board should \nrun at right angles to each other. This reduce s the effects of \nfeedthrough through the board. A microstrip technique is by far \nthe best but is not  always possible with a double -sided board. In \nthis technique, the component side of the boar d is dedicated to \nground planes, and signals are placed on the solder side.  \nGood decoupling is also important. All analog supplies should \nbe decoupled wi th 10 µ F tantalum in parallel with 0.1 µ F capaci -\ntors to AGND. To achieve the best from these decoupling components, they must be placed as close as possible to the device, ideally right up against the device. The 0.1 µ F capacitors \nshould have low effectiv e series r esistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESI), such as the common ceramic types or surface mount types, which provide a low impedance path to ground at high frequencies to handle transient currents due to internal logic switching.  \nPCB DES IGN GUIDEL INES F OR CHIP SCALE \nPACKAGE  \nThe lands on the chip scale package (CP -32) are rectangular. \nThe printed circuit board pad for these should be 0.1 mm \nlonger than the package land length and 0.05 mm wider than \nthe package land width. The land should b e centered  on the \npad. This ensure s that the solder joint size is maximized. The \nbottom of the chip scale package has a central thermal pad. The \nthermal pad on the printed circuit board should be at least as \nlarge as this exposed pad. On the printed circui t board, t here \nshould be a clearance of at least 0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the inner edges of the pad pattern. This ensure s that \nshorting is avoided. Thermal vias can  be used on the printed \ncircuit board thermal pad to improve thermal performance  of \nthe package. If vias are used, they should be incorporated in the thermal pad at 1.2 mm pitch grid. The via diameter should be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm , and the via barrel should be \nplated with 1 oz. copper to plug the via. The user should connect th e printed circuit board thermal pad to AGND.  \nEVALUATING THE AD7490 PERFORMANCE  \nThe recommended layout for the AD7490 is outlined in the evaluation board for the AD7490. The evaluation board package  \nincludes a fully assembled  and tested evaluation board, do cumen -\ntation, and software for controlling the board from the PC via \nthe EV AL -CONTROL  BRD2 . The EVA L -CONTROL BRD2  can \nbe used in conjunction with the AD7490 evaluation board, as \nwell as many other Analog Devices , Inc., evaluation boards \nending in the CB de signator, to demonstrate and evaluate the ac \nand dc performance of the AD7490.  \nThe software allows the user to perform ac (fast Fourier \ntransform) and dc (histogram of codes) tests on the AD7490. The software and documentation are on a CD shipped with the  \nevalu ation board.  \n \nData Sheet AD7490  \n \nRev.
