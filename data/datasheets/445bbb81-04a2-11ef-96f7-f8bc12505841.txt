As part of this \nspecification the existence of a host controller and a memory storage array are implied but the \noperation of these pieces is not fully specified.  \nKingston NAND Device  consists of  a single chip MMC  controller and NAND flash memory module. The \nmicro -controller interfaces with a host system allowing data to be written to and read from the NAND \nflash memory module. The controller allows the host to be independent fro m details of erasing and \nprogramming the flash memory.  \n \n \nFigure 1– e•MMC™ System Overview  \n \n3.2. Memory Addressing  \nPrevious implementations of the e•MMC™ spec ification are following  byte addressing with  32 bit field. \nThis addressing mechanism permitted for e•MMC™ densities up to and including 2 GB.  \nTo support larger densities the addressing mechanism was update to support sector addresses (512 B \nsectors). The sector addresses shall be used for all device s with capacity larger than 2 GB.  \nTo determine the addressing mode use the host should read bit [30:29] in the OCR register.  \n \n \n \n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 7 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. 3.3. e•MMC™ Device Overview  \nThe e•MMC™ device transfers data via a configurable number of data bus signals. The communication \nsignals are:  \n3.3.1  Clock (CLK)  \nEach cycle of this signal directs a one bit transfer on the command and either a one bit (1x) or a \ntwo bits transfer (2x) on all the data lines . The frequency may vary between zero and the maximum \nclock frequency.  \n \n3.3.2  Data Strobe (DS)   \nThis signal is generated by the device and used for output in HS400 mode. The frequency of this \nsignal follows the frequency of CLK. For data output each cycle of this signal directs two bits \ntransfer(2x) on the data - one bit for positive edge and the othe r bit for negative edge. For CRC \nstatus response output and CMD response output(enabled only HS400  enhanced strobe mode), \nthe CRC status is latched on the positive e dge only, and don't care on the  negative edge.  \n \n3.3.3  Command (CMD)  \nThis signal is a bidirectiona l command channel used for Device initialization and transfer of \ncommands. The CMD signal has two operation modes: open -drain for initialization mode, and \npush -pull for fast command transfer. Commands are sent from the e•MMC™ host controller to the \ne•MMC™ Device and responses are sent from the Device to the host.  \n \n3.3.4  Input/O utputs (DAT0 -DAT7)  \nThese are bidirectional data channels. The DAT signals operate in push -pull mode. Only the Device \nor the host is driving these signals at a time. By default, after power up or reset, only DAT0 is used \nfor data transfer. A wider data bus can be configured f or data transfer, using either DAT0 -DAT3 or \nDAT0 -DAT7, by the e•MMC™ host controller. The e•MMC™ Device includes internal pull -ups for \ndata lines DAT1 -DAT7. Immediately after entering the 4 -bit mode, the Device disconnects the \ninternal pull ups of lines DA T1, DAT2, and DAT3. Correspondingly, immediately after entering to \nthe 8 -bit mode the Device disconnects the inter nal pull -ups of lines DAT1 –DAT7.  \nTable 4– Communication Interface  \nName  Type1  Description  \nCLK  I  Clock  \nDAT0  I/O/PP  Data  \nDAT1  I/O/PP  Data  \nDAT2  I/O/PP  Data  \nDAT3  I/O/PP  Data  \nDAT4  I/O/PP  Data  \nDAT5  I/O/PP  Data  \nDAT6  I/O/PP  Data  \nDAT7  I/O/PP  Data  \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 8 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc.

The host has a clock generator, which \nsupplies CLK to the Device. For write operations, clock and data direction are the same, write \ndata can be transferred synchronous with CLK, regardless of transmission line delay. For read \noperations, clock and data direction are opposite; the read data received by Host is delayed by \nround -trip delay, output delay and latency of Host and Device.

The host sends a \ncommand, which results in a device response. For more details, refer to section 6.1 of the JEDEC \nStandard Specification No. JESD84 -B51 .  \nFive operation modes are defined for the e•MMC™ system:\uf020\n• Boot operation mode  \n• Device identification mo de  \n• Interrupt mode  \n• Data transfer mode  \n• Inactive mode  \n \n4.2 Boot Operation M ode  \nIn boot operation mode, the master ( e•MMC™ host) can read boot data from the slave ( e•MMC™ device) \nby keeping CMD line low or sending CMD0 with argument + 0xFFFFFFFA, before issuing CMD1. The \ndata can be read from either boot area or user area depending on register setting. For more details, \nrefer to section 6.3 of the JEDEC Standard Specificat ion No. JESD84 -B51 . \n \n4.3 Device Identification Mode  \nWhile in device identification mode the host resets the device , validates operation voltage range and \naccess mode, identifies the device and assigns a Relative device Address (RCA) to the device on the bus. \nAll data communication in the Device Identification Mode uses the command line (CMD) only. For more \ndetails, refer to section 6.4 of the JEDEC Standard Specification No. JESD84 -B51 . \n \n4.4 Interrupt Mode  \nThe interrupt mode on the e•MMC™ system enables the master ( e•MMC™ host) to grant the \ntransmission allowance to the slaves (Device) simultaneously. This mode reduces the polling load for \nthe host and hence, the power consumption of the system, while maintaining adequate responsiveness \nof the host to a Device reques t for service. Supporting e•MMC™ interrupt mode is an option, both for \nthe host and the Device. For more details, refer to section 6.5 of the JEDEC Standard Specification \nNo.JESD84 -B51 . \n \n4.5 Data T ransfer Mode  \nWhen the Device is in Stand -by State, communication over the CMD and DAT lines will be performed \nin push -pull mode.

Using this mechanism \nthe host downloads a new version of the firmware to the e.MMC device and, following a successful \ndownload, instructs the e.MMC device to install the new downloaded firmware into the device.  \nIn order to start the FFU process the host first checks if the e.MMC device supports FFU \ncapabilities by reading SUPPPORTED_MODES and FW_CONFIG fields in the EXT_CSD. If the e.MMC \ndevice supports the FFU feature the host may start the FFU process. The FFU process starts by \nswitching to FFU Mode in MODE_CONFIG field in the EXT_CSD. In FFU Mode host should use closed -\nended or open ended commands for downloading the new firmware and reading vendor proprietary \ndata. In this mode, the host should set the argument of these command s to be as defined in FFU_ARG \nfield.  In case these commands have a different argument the device behavior is not defined and the \nFFU process may fail.  The host should set Block  Length to be DATA_SECTOR_SIZE. Downloaded \nfirmware bundle must be DATA_SECTOR_S IZE size aligned (internal padding of the bundle might be \nrequired).Once in FFU Mode the host may send the new firmware bundle to the device using one or \nmore write commands.  \nThe host could regain regular functional ity of write and read commands by setting  MODE_CONFIG \nfield in the EXT_CSD back to Normal state. Switching out of FFU Mode may abort the firmware \ndownload operation.  When host switched back  to FFU Mode, the host should check the FFU Status to \nget indication about the number of sectors which were downloaded successfully by reading the \nNUMBER_OF_FW_SECTORS_CORRECTLY_PROGRAMMED in the extended CSD. In case the number of \nsectors which were downloaded successfully is zero the host should re -start downloading the new \nfirmware bundle from its first secto r. In case the number of sectors which were downloaded \nsuccessfully is positive the host should continue the download from the next sector, which would \nresume the firmware download operation.  \nIn case MODE_OPERATION_CODES field is not supported by the devic e the host sets to NORMAL \nstate and initiates a CMD0/HW_Reset/Power cycle to install the new firmware. In such case the \ndevice doesn ’t need to use NUMBER_OF_FW_SECTORS_CORRECTLY_PROGRAMMED.  \nIn both cases occurrence of a CMD0/HW_Reset/Power occurred before the host successfully \ndownloaded the new firmware bundle to the device may cause the firmware download process to be \naborted.  \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 15 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. 4.10   Power off Notification  for sleep  \nThe host should notify the device before it powers the device off. This  allows the device to better \nprepare itself for being powered off. Power the device off means to turn off all its power supplies. In \nparticular, the host should issue a power off notification (POWER_OFF_LONG, POWER_OFF_SHORT ) \nif it intends to turn off bot h VCC and V CCQ  power I or it may use to a power off notification \n(SLEEP_NOTIFICATION ) if it intends to turn -off V CC after moving the device to Sleep state.  \nTo indicate to the device that power off notification is supported by the host, a supporting host \nshall first set the POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION byte in EXT_CSD [34] to POWERED_ON (0x01). To \nexecute a power off, before powering the device down the host will changes the value to either \nPOWER_OFF_SHORT (0x02) or POWER_OFF_LONG (0x03). Host should waits for t he busy line to be \nde-asserted. Once the setting has changed to either 0x02 or 0x03, host may safely power off the \ndevice.  \nThe host may issue SLEEP_AWAKE (CMD5) to enter or to exit from Sleep state if \nPOWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION byte is set to POWERED_ON. Befo re moving to Standby state and then \nto Sleep state, the host sets POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION to SLEEP_NOTIFICATION and waits for the \nDAT0 line de -assertion. While in Sleep (slp) state V CC (Memory supply) may b e turned off as defined \nin 4.1.6 . Removing power su pplies other than V CC while the device is in the Sleep (slp) state may \nresult in undefined device behavior. Before removing all power supplies, the host should transition \nthe device out of Sleep (slp) state back to Transfer state using CMD5 and CMD7 and th en execute a \npower off notification setting POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION byte to either POWER_OFF_SHORT or \nPOWER_OFF_LONG.  \nIf host continues to send commands to the device after switching to the power off setting (POWER\n_OFF_LONG, POWER_OFF_SHORT or SLEEP_NOTIFIC ATION) or performs HPI during its busy conditio\nn, the device shall restore the POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION byte to POWERED_ON.  \nIf host tries to change POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION to 0x00 after writing another value there, a SWIT\nCH_ERROR is generated.  \nThe difference between the two power -off modes is how urgent the host wants to turn power off. \nThe device should respond to POWER_OFF_SHORT quickly under the generic CMD6 timeout. If more t\nime is acceptable, POWER_OFF_LONG may be used and the device shall respond to it w ithin the POW\nER_OFF_LONG_TIME timeout.  \nWhile POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION is set to POWERED_ON, the device expects the host to host shall:  \n•Keep the device power s upplies alive (both V CC and V CCQ) and in their active mode  \n•Not power off the device intentionally before changing POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION to either      \nPOWER_OFF_LONG or POWER_OFF_SHORT  \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 16 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. •Not power off V CC intentionally before changing POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION to \nSLEEP_NOTIFICATION and before moving the device to Sleep state  \n \nBefore moving to Sleep state h osts may set the POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION byte to \nSLEEP_NOTIFICATION (0x04) if aware that the device is capable of autonomously initiating \nbackground operations for possible performance improvements. Host should wait for the busy line to \nbe de -asserted. Busy  line may be asserted up the period defined in SLEEP_NOTIFICATION_TIME byte \nin EXT_CSD [216]. Once the setting has changed to 0x04 host may set the device into Sleep mode \n(CMD7+CMD5). After getting out from Sleep the POWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION byte will restor e its \nvalue to POWERED_ON. HPI may interrupt the SLEEP_NOTIFICATION operation. In that case \nPOWER_OFF_NOTIFICATION byte will restore to POWERED_ON.  \n \n4.11  Cache Enhancement Barrier  \nBarrier function provides a way to perform a delayed in -order flushing of a cached data. The \nmain motivation for using barrier commands is to avoid the long delay that is introduced by flush \ncommands. There are cases where the host is not interested in flushing the data right away, however \nit would like to keep an order between di fferent cached data batches. The barrier command enables \nthe host achieving the in -order goal but without paying the flush delay, since the real flushing can be \ndelayed by the device to some later idle time. The formal definition of the barrier rule is as follows:  \nDenote a sequence of requests Ri, i=0,..,N. Assuming a barrier is set between requests Rx and \nRx+1 (0<x<N) then all the requests R0..Rx must be flushed to the non -volatile memory before any of \nthe requests Rx+1..RN.  \n \nBetween two barriers the devic e is free to write data into the non -volatile memory in any order. \nIf the host wants to preserve a certain order it shall flush the cache or set another barrier at a point \nwhere order is important.  \nThe barrier is set by writing to the BARRIER bit of the FL USH_CACHE byte (EXT_CSD byte [32]). \nAny error resulted can be read from the status register by CMD13 after the completion of the \nprogramming as defined for a normal write request. The error could affect any data written to the \ncache since the previous flus h operation.  \nThe device shall support any number of barrier commands between two flush commands. In \ncase of multiple barrier commands between two flush commands a subset of the cached data may be \ncommitted to the non -volatile memory according to the barrie r rule. Internally, a device may have an \nupper limit on the barrier amount it can absorb without flushing the cache. That is, if the host \nexceeds this barrier amount, the device may issue, internally, a normal flush.  \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 17 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. The device shall expose its barrier sup port capability via the BARRIER_SUPPORT byte (EXT_CSD \nbyte [486]). If a device does not support barrier function this register shall be zero. If a device \nsupports barrier function this register shall be one.  \nAssuming the device supports barrier function, i f the BARRIER bit of the FLUSH_CACHE byte is \nset, a barrier operation shall be executed.  \nIf the cache gets totally full and/or the cache is not able to receive the data of the next access \n(per block count indicated in CMD23 or per initiated single / open e nded multiple block write in \ngeneral) then it shall still be the responsibility of the e•MMC device to store the data of the next \naccess within the timeouts that are specified elsewhere in this specification. The actual algorithm to \nhandle the new data and  possible flush of some older cached data is left for the implementation.  \nNote: When issuing a force -programming write request (CMD23 with bit 24 on) or a reliable \nwrite request (CMD23 with bit 31 on), the host should be aware that the data will be written  to the \nnon -volatile memory, potentially, before any cached data, even if a barrier command was issued. \nTherefore, if the writing order to the non -volatile memory is important, it is the responsibility of the \nhost to issue a flush command before the force -programming or the reliable -write request.  \nIn order to use the barrier function, the host shall set bit 0 of BARRIER_EN (EXT_CSD byte [31]). \nThe barrier feature is optional for an e•MMC device.  \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 18 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. 4.12  Cache Flushing Policy  \nThe host may require the  device to flush data from the cache in an in -order manner. From time \nto time, to guarantee in -order flushing, the host may command the device to flush the device cache or \nmay use a barrier command.  \nHowever, if the e•MMC device flushing policy is to flush data from the cache in an in -order \nmanner, cache barrier commands or flush commands operations (In case goal is to guarantee the \nflushing order) are redundant and impose a needless overhead to the device and host.  \nFIFO bit in CACHE_FLUSH_POLICY field (EXT_ CSD byte [240]) is used by the device to indicate to \nthe host that the device cache flushing policy is First -In-First -Out; this means that the device \nguarantees that the order of the flushing of data would be the in same order which data was written \nto the  cache. When the FIFO bit is set it is recommended for the host not to send cache barrier \ncommands or flush operations which goal is to guarantee the flushing order as they are redundant \nand impose a burden to the system.  \nHowever, if the FIFO bit is set to  1b and the device supports the cache barrier mechanism, the \nhost may still send barrier commands without getting an error. Sending these commands will not \nchange the device behavior as device flushes cache in -order anyway.  \n \nThe CACHE_FLUSH_POLICY field is  read -only field and never change its value either by the host \nor device.  \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 19 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. 4.13  Command Queueing  \nTo facilitate command queuing in e•MMC, the device manages an internal task queue to which \nthe host can queue data transfer tasks.  \nInitially the task  queue is empty. Every task is issued by the host and initially queued as pending. \nThe device controller works to prepare pending tasks for execution. When a task is ready for \nexecution its state changes to “ready for execution”. The exact meaning of “read y for execution” is left \nfor device implementation.  \nThe host tracks the state of all queued tasks and may order the execution of any task, which is \nmarked as “ready for execution” by sending a command indicating its task ID. When the execute \ncommand is rec eived (CMD46/CMD47) the device executes the data transfer transaction.  \n \nFor example, in order to queue a write transaction the host sends a CMD44 indicating the task’s \nparameters. The device responds and the host sends a CMD45, indicating the start block a ddress.  \nThe device regards the two commands as a single task in the queue and sends a response \nindicating success if no error is detected. This exchange may be executed on the CMD line while a \ndata transfer, or busy state, is ongoing on the DAT lines. The host tracks the state of the queue using \nCMD13.  \nAt a later time, when data transfer is not in progress, the host issues a CMD47, ordering the \ndevice to execute a task from the queue, providing the Task ID in its argument. The device responds \nwith an R1 res ponse and the data transfer starts.  \nNote that if hosts need to access RPMB partition, the host should disable the Command Queue \nmechanism and access RPMB partition not through the command queue.  \nGeneral Purpose partitions may be accessed when command queue ing is enabled.  \nThe queue must be empty when CMD6 is sent (to switch partitions or to disable command \nqueueing).  \nSending CMD6 while the queue is not empty shall be regarded as illegal command (as explained \n6.6.42.9 Supported Commands ). \nPrior to enabling command queuing, the block size shall be set to 512B. Device may respond \nwith an error to CMD46/CMD47 if block size is not 512B.  \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 20 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. 5. Register  Settings  \nWithin the Device interface six registers are defined: OCR, CID, CSD, EXT_CSD, RCA and DSR. These \ncan be accessed only by corresponding commands (see Section 6.10 of JESD84 -B51 ).  \n \n5.1. OCR Register  \nThe 32 -bit operation conditions register (OCR) stores the VDD voltage profile of the Device and the \naccess mode indication. In addition, this register includes a status information bit. This status bit is set \nif the Device power up procedure has been finished. The OCR register shall be implemented by all \nDevices.   \n \n5.2. CID Register  \nThe Card Identification (CID) register is 128 bits wide. It contains the Device identification information \nused during the Device identification phase ( e•MMC™ protocol). For details, refer to JEDEC Standard \nSpecification No. JESD84 -B51  \n \n5.3. CSD Register  \nThe Card -Specific Data (CSD) register provides information on how to access the contents stored in \ne•MMC™. The CSD registers are used to define the error correction type, maximum data access time , \ndata transfer speed, data format…etc. For details, refer to section 7.3 of the JEDEC Standard \nSpecification No. JESD84 -B51 . \n5.4. Extended CSD Register  \nThe Extended CSD register defines the Device  properties and selected modes. It is 512 bytes long. The \nmost significant 320 bytes are the Properties segment, which  defines the Device  capabilities and \ncannot be modified by the host. The lower 192 bytes are the Modes segment, which defines the \nconfiguration the Device  is working in. These modes can be changed by the host by means of the \nSWITCH command. For details, re fer to section 7.4 of the JEDEC Standard Specification No. JESD84 -B51 . \n5.5. RCA Register  \nThe writable 16 -bit R elative Device Address (RCA) register carries the Device address assigned by the \nhost during the Device identification. This address is used for the addressed host -Device \ncommunication after the Device identification procedure. The default value of the RCA register is \n0x0001. The value 0x0000 is reserved to set all Devices into the Stand -by State with CMD7. For detailed \nregister setting value, please refer to appendix or KSI FAE.  \n5.6. DSR Register  \nThe 16 -bit driver stage register (DSR) is described in detail in Section 7.6 of t he JEDEC Standard \nSpecification No. JESD84 -B51 . It can be optionally used to improve the bus performance for extended \noperating conditions (depending on parameters like bus length, transfer rate or number of Devices). \nThe CSD register carries the informatio n about the DSR register usage. For detailed register setting \nvalue, please refer to appendix or KSI FAE.  \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 21 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. 6. The e•MMC™ bus  \nThe e•MMC™ bus has ten communication lines and three supply lines:  \n• CMD： Command is a bidirectional signal. The host and Device drivers are operating in two \nmodes,   open drain and push/pull.  \n• DAT0 -7： Data lines are bidirectional signals. Host and Device drivers are operating in \npush -pull mode  \n• CLK： Clock is a host to Device si gnal. CLK operates in push -pull mode  \n• Data  Strobe : Data  Strobe  is a Device  to host  signal.  Data Strobe  operates  in push-pull  mode.  \n \n \nFigure 6– Bus C ircuitry Diagram  \n \nThe R OD is switched on and off by the host synchronously to the open -drain and push -pull mode \ntransitions. The host does not have to have open drain drivers, but must recognize this mode to \nswitch on the R OD. RDAT and R CMD are pull -up resistors protecting the CMD and the DAT lines against \nbus floating device when all device drivers are in a high -impedance mode.  \nA constant current source can replace the R OD by achieving a better performance (constant slopes \nfor the signal r ising and falling edges). If the host does not allow the switchable R OD implementation, \na fixed R CMD can be used). Consequently the maximum operating frequency in the open drain mode \nhas to be reduced if the used  RCMD value  is higher than the minimal one g iven in .  \n \nRData strobe  is pull-down resistor used in HS400 device .  \n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 22 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. 6.1 Power -up \n6.1.1  e•MMC™ power -up \nAn e•MMC™ bus power -up is handled locally in each device and in the bus master.

However, there may be Devices or devices which \nutilize clock falling edge to output data in backward compatibility mode. Therefore, it is recommended for hosts \neither to settWL value as long as possible within the range which will not go over tCK -tOH(min) in the system \nor to use slow clock frequency, so that host could have data set up margin for those devices. In this case, each \ndevice  which utilizes clock falling edge might show the correlation either between tWL and tOSU or between \ntCK and tOSU for the device in its own datasheet as a note or its appli cation notes.  \n \n6.5 Bus Timing for DAT Signals During Dual  Data Rate Operation  \nThese timings applies to the DAT[7:0] signals only when the device is configured for dual data mode \noperation. In this dual data mode, the DAT signals operate  synchronously of both the rising and the \nfalling edges of CLK. The CMD signal still operates synchronously of the rising edge of CLK and \ntherefore complies with the bus timing specified in section 10.5, therefore there is no timing change \nfor the CMD sign al. \n \n \nFigure 13– Timing Diagram: Data Input/ Output in Dual Data Rate Mode  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \nCONFIDENTIAL  \n \n 32 \nFlash  Storage Specification e•MMC™ 5.1 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n Flash Storage Specification \ne•MMC ™ 4.5 \n© 201 6 Kingston Solutions  Inc. 6.5.1  Dual Data Rate Interface Timings  \nTable 17– High -speed Dual Data R ate Interface Timing  \nParameter  Symbol  Min  Max.
