These devices also offer 5 A (8/20 μs) peak pulse current ratings per IEC 61000-4-5 (surge) \nspecification.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagrams\nGNDD2+\nD2-D1+\nD1-\nFigure 7-1. TPD4EUSB30 Circuit\nGNDD+ D–\nFigure 7-2. TPD2EUSB30/A Circuit\n7.3 Feature Description\nTPDxEUSB30/A is a family of uni-directional Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection devices with low \ncapacitance. Each IO line is rated to dissipate ESD strikes at or above the maximum level specified in the \nIEC 61000-4-2 (Level 4 Contact) international standard. The TPDxEUSB30/A\'s low loading capacitance makes it \nideal for protection super speed high-speed signals.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe TPDxEUSB30/A family of devices are passive integrated circuits that activate whenever voltages above \nVBR or below the lower diodes V forward  (–0.6V) are present upon the circuit being protected. During ESD events, \nvoltages as high as ±8 kV (contact) can be directed to ground via the internal diode network. Once the voltages \non the protected lines fall below the trigger voltage of the device (usually within 10\'s of nano-seconds) the device \nreverts to passive.TPD2EUSB30, TPD2EUSB30A, TPD4EUSB30\nSLVSAC2G – AUGUST 2010 – REVISED JUNE 2021 www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPD2EUSB30  TPD2EUSB30A  TPD4EUSB30\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe TPDxEUSB30/A family is a family of diode array type transient voltage suppressors (TVS) which are \ntypically used to provide a path to ground for dissipating ESD events on hi-speed signal lines between a human \ninterface connector and a system. As the current from ESD passes through the TVS, only a small voltage drop \nis present across the diode. This is the voltage presented to the protected IC. The low R DYN of the triggered TVS \nholds this voltage, V CLAMP , to a tolerable level to the protected IC.\n8.2 Typical Application\nThis application describes a TPDxEUSB30/A eye pattern test. Figure 10-2  shows the lab board that was \ndesigned to demonstrate the degradation of the eye pattern quality with and without the TPD2EUSB30/A in the \nUSB 3.0 signal path. The measurements show that there is only ~2 ps jitter penalty to the differential signal \nwhen the TPD2EUSB30/A device is added in the signal path. A similar setup was employed to measure the eye \ndiagram for the TPD4EUSB30.\nPattern Generator TPD2EUSB30 USB3.0 Receiver PHY 36” Lossy Transmission LineEye Pattern\nMeasurement Point\nFigure 8-1.

Given the USB application, the following parameters are known.\nTable 8-1.

Care should be \ntaken to not violate the maximum voltage specification to ensure that the device functions properly. The D+ and \nD– lines share a TVS diode which can tolerate up to 6 V.\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\n•The optimum placement is as close to the connector as possible.\n–EMI during an ESD event can couple from the trace being struck to other nearby unprotected traces, \nresulting in early system failures.\n–The PCB designer needs to minimize the possibility of EMI coupling by keeping any unprotected traces \naway from the protected traces which are between the TVS and the connector.\n•Route the protected traces as straight as possible.\n•Eliminate any sharp corners on the protected traces between the TVS and the connector by using rounded \ncorners with the largest radii possible.\n–Electric fields tend to build up on corners, increasing EMI coupling.\nRefer to Figure 10-1 , the TPD2EUSB30/A are offered in space saving DRT package. The DRT is a 1-mm × \n1-mm package with flow-through pin-mapping for the high-speed differential lines. The TPD4EUSB30 is offered \nin space saving DQA package. The DQA is a 1-mm × 2.5-mm package with flow-through pin-mapping for the \nhigh-speed differential lines. It is recommended to place the package right next to the USB 3.0 connector. \nThe GND pin should connected to GND plane of the board through a large VIA. If a dedicated GND plane is \nnot present right underneath, it is recommended to route to the GND plane through a wide trace. The current \nassociated with IEC ESD stress can be in the range of 30Amps or higher momentarily. A good, low impedance \nGND path ensures the system robustness against IEC ESD stress.\nThe TPDxEUSB30/A can provide system level ESD protection to the high-speed differential ports (> 5 Gbps data \nrate). The flow-through package offers flexibility for board routing with traces up to 15 mills wide. It allows the \ndifferential signal pairs couple together right after they touch the ESD ports of the TPDxEUSB30/A.www.ti.comTPD2EUSB30, TPD2EUSB30A, TPD4EUSB30\nSLVSAC2G – AUGUST 2010 – REVISED JUNE 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPD2EUSB30  TPD2EUSB30A  TPD4EUSB30\n10.2 Layout Examples\n1-mm1-mmGND\nD+D-\n1-mm1-mm1-mm1-mmGND\nD+D-TPD2EUSB30DRTRTX+\nTX-\nGND\nRX+\nRX-VBUS\nD-\nD+\nGND8-mmUSB 3.0\nHost/ Controller\nTX+\nTX-\nGND\nRX+\nRX-VBUS\nD-\nD+\nGNDUSB 3.0\nHost/ Controller8-mm\n1-mm2.5-mm\n1-mm1-mm2.5-mm2.5-mmTPD4EUSB30\nD1+\nD1-\nGND GND\nD2+\nD2-\nOne TPD4EUSB30 & One TPD2EUSB30 to Protect USB3.0 Class A connec tor (Two Layer Routing)Three TPD2EUSB30 to Protect USB3.0 Class A connector (One Layer Routing)\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.\nFigure 10-1.

**Description:**
The TPD2EUSB30 is a 2-channel Transient Voltage Suppressor (TVS) based Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection diode array designed to protect high-speed data lines, particularly in USB 3.0 applications. It is engineered to handle ESD strikes at levels specified by the IEC 61000-4-2 standard, making it suitable for environments where ESD events are common. The device features low capacitance and dynamic resistance, which helps maintain signal integrity while providing robust protection.

**Typical Applications:**
The TPD2EUSB30 is commonly used in:
- Notebooks
- Set-top boxes
- DVD players
- Media players
- Portable computers

These applications benefit from the device's ability to protect sensitive electronic components from ESD damage, ensuring reliable operation in consumer electronics and communication devices. The low capacitance also makes it ideal for high-speed data transmission, minimizing signal distortion and maintaining data integrity.
