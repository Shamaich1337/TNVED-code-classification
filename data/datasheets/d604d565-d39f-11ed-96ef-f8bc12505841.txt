#### Description:
The MASW-008955 is a GaAs pHEMT MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) single pole three throw (SP3T) switch. It is designed for applications requiring low control voltage, low insertion loss, high isolation, compact size, and cost-effectiveness. The device is fabricated using a 0.5 micron gate length GaAs pHEMT process, which ensures high performance and reliability due to full passivation.

#### Typical Applications:
The MASW-008955 is primarily used in:
- **Wireless Communication Systems:** Such as WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) and Bluetooth systems, where it facilitates the switching between different RF paths (e.g., connecting separate receive functions to a common antenna).
- **Filter and Antenna Switching:** In systems operating up to 3.5 GHz, it is ideal for applications that require efficient signal routing with minimal loss.
- **Timing Sensitive Applications:** Due to its low gate lag, it is suitable for applications where timing is critical.

This component is particularly advantageous in modern communication devices where space and efficiency are paramount.
