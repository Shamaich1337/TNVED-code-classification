The L T3571 features a high side ﬁ  xed voltage drop APD current moni-\ntor with better than 10% relative accuracy over the entire temperature range. The integrated power switch, Schottky diode and APD current monitor allow a small solution footprint and low solution cost. It combines a traditional voltage loop and a unique current loop to operate as a constant-current source or constant-voltage source. The inductor-based topology ensures an input free from switching noise. The integrated high side current monitor produces a current proportional to the APD current with better than 10% relative accuracy over four decades of dynamic range in the input range of 250nA to 2.5mA. This current can be used as a reference to provide a digitally programmed output voltage via the CTRL pin.

Block Diagram\nLT3571\n83571faThe L T3571 boost converter uses a constant-frequency \ncurrent mode control scheme to provide excellent line \nand load regulation. Operation can be best understood by referring to the Block Diagram in Figure 1. At the start of each oscillator cycle, the SR latch is set, which turns on the Q1 power switch. A voltage proportional to the switch current is added to a stabilizing ramp and the resulting sum is fed into the positive terminal of the PWM comparator, A4. When this voltage exceeds the level at the negative input of A4, the SR latch is reset, turning off the power switch. The level at the negative input of A4 is set by the error ampliﬁ  er A3. A3 has two inputs, \none from the voltage feedback loop and the other one from the current loop. Whichever feedback input is lower takes precedence and forces the converter into either constant-current or constant-voltage mode. The L T3571 is designed to transition cleanly between these two modes of operation. The current sense ampliﬁ  er senses the voltage \nacross R\nSENSE  and provides a pre-gain to ampliﬁ  er A1. \nThe output of A1 is simply an ampliﬁ  ed version of the \ndifference between the voltage across R SENSE  and 200mV. In this manner, the error ampliﬁ  er sets the correct peak \nswitch current level to regulate through R SENSE . The FB \nvoltage loop is implemented by the ampliﬁ  er A2. When \nthe voltage loop dominates, the error ampliﬁ  er regulates \nthe FB pin to the lower of 1V, or externally provided CTRL voltage (constant-voltage mode), and sets the correct peak current level to keep the output in regulation.\nThe L T3571 has an integrated high side APD current monitor \nwith a 5:1 ratio. The voltage drop across the MONIN pin and APD pin is ﬁ  xed at 5V. The MONIN pin can accept a supply \nvoltage up to 75V, which is suitable for APD photodiode applications. The MON pin has an open-circuit protection feature and is internally clamped to 11.5V. \nIf an APD is tied to the APD pin, the current will be mir-\nrored to the MON pin and converted to a voltage signal by the resistor R4. This voltage signal can be used to drive an external control block to adjust the APD voltage by adjusting the feedback threshold of EAMP A2 through the CTRL input.OPERATION\nLT3571\n93571faSwitching Frequency\nThere are two methods to set the switching frequency of the \nL T3571. Both methods require a resistor connected at the R\nT pin. Do not leave the R T pin open. Also, do not load this \npin with a capacitor. A resistor must always be connected for proper operation. One way to set the frequency is simply connecting an external resistor between the R\nT pin and \nGND. See Table 1 or the Oscillator Frequency vs R T graph \nin the Typical Performance Characteristics for resistor values and corresponding switching frequencies. The other way is to make the L T3571 synchronize with an external clock via the SYNC pin. For proper operation, a resistor should be connected at the R\nT pin and able to generate \na switching frequency 20% lower than the external clock when the external clock is absent.\nTable 1.

When supply voltage is applied to the V IN pin, the \nvoltage difference between V IN and V OUT generates inrush \ncurrent ﬂ  owing from input through the inductor and the \nSchottky diode (D1 in the Block Diagram), to charge the output capacitor. The selection of inductor and capacitor value should ensure the peak of the inrush current to below 1A. In addition, the L T3571 turn-on should be delayed until the inrush current is less than the maximum current limit. The peak inrush current can be estimated as follows:\n \n IP=VIN– 0.9\nL\nC–1\x81 exp –π\n2L\nC–1⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎜⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n⎟⎟\nwhere L is the inductance, and C is the output capacitance. Table 2 gives inrush peak currents for some component \nselections .\nTable 2. Inrush Peak Current\nVIN (V) L (μH) C (μF) I P (A)\n5 10 1 0.815 22 1 0.63\nSetting Output Voltage\nThe L T3571 is equipped with both an internal 1V reference \nand an auxiliary reference input (the CTRL pin). This feature allows users to select between using the built-in reference and supplying an external reference voltage. The voltage at the CTRL pin can be adjusted while the chip is operating, to alter the output voltage of L T3571 for purposes such as APD’s bias voltage adjustment. To use the internal 1V reference, the CTRL pin should be held higher than 1.2V, which can be done by tying it to V\nREF. \nWhen the CTRL pin is between 0V and 1V, the L T3571 will regulate the output such that the FB pin voltage is equal to the CTRL pin voltage. To set the output voltage, select the values of R1 and R2 (see Figure 2) according to the following equation:\n \nR1=R2VMONIN\nV1–1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nwhere V1 = 1V if the internal reference is used, or V1 = \nCTRL if CTRL is between 0V and 1V. R2 can be selected to load the output to maintain a constant switching frequency when the APD load is very low. Preventing entry into pulse-skipping mode is an important consideration for post ﬁ  ltering the regulator output.\nFigure 2. Output Voltage Feedback Connection APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nMONIN\nCTRLR13\n15 14\n3571 F02FBLT3571\nR2\nLT3571\n103571fa APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInductor Selection\nThe inductors used with the L T3571 should have a \nsaturation current rating of 0.4A, or greater. If the device is used in an application where the input supply will be hot-plugged, the saturation current rating should be equal to, or greater than, the peak inrush current. For best loop stability, the inductor value selected should provide a ripple current of 80mA or more. For a given V\nIN and V OUT, \nthe inductor value to use in continuous conduction mode (CCM) is estimated by the formula:\n L=D\x81VIN\nƒ\x818 0 m A\nwhere:\n D=VOUT+1– VIN\nVOUT+1\nand f is the switching frequency. \nTo achieve low output voltage ripple, a small value inductor \nshould be selected to force the L T3571 to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The inequality is true when the L T3571 is operating in discontinuous conduction mode.\n \n L<D\x81VIN\nƒ\x81ILIMIT\nwhere I LIMIT is the switch current limit. Operating in DCM \nreduces the maximum load current and the conversion efﬁ  ciency.\nCapacitor Selection\nLow ESR capacitors should be used at the output to \nminimize the output voltage ripple. Use only X5R and X7R types, because they retain their capacitance over wider voltage and temperature ranges than other types. High output voltages typically require less capacitance for loop stability. Typically, use a 1μF capacitor for output voltage less than 25V, and a 0.22μF capacitor for output voltage beyond 25V. Place the output capacitor as close as possible to the V\nOUT lead and to the GND of the IC.Either ceramic or solid tantalum capacitors may be used \nfor the input decoupling capacitor, which should be placed as close as possible to the L T3571. A 1μF capacitor is sufﬁ  cient for most applications. \nPhase Lead Capacitor\nA small value capacitor (i.e., 10pF to 22pF) can be added \nin parallel with the resistor between the output and the FB pin to reduce output perturbation due to a load step and to improve transient response. This phase lead capacitor introduces a pole-zero pair to the feedback that boosts the phase margin near the crossover frequency. The APD is very sensitive to a noisy bias supply. To lowpass ﬁ  lter noise \nfrom the internal reference and error ampliﬁ  er, a 0.1μF \nphase lead capacitor can be used. The corner frequency of the noise ﬁ  lter is R1 • C\nPL. \nAPD Current Monitor\nThe power supply switching noise associated with a \nswitching power supply can interfere with the photodiode DC measurement. To suppress this noise, a 0.1μF capacitor is recommended at the APD pin. An additional series resistor is necessary to ensure enough high frequency compensation at the APD pin over the full operating range of the L T3571, as shown in Figure 1. An additional output lowpass ﬁ  lter, a 10k resistor and a 10nF capacitor in \nparallel at MON pin can further reduce the power supply noise, and other wide band noise, which might limit the measurement accuracy of low current levels. \nFor applications requiring fast current monitor response \ntime, an RC lowpass ﬁ  lter at the MONIN pin is used to \nreplace the 0.1μF capacitor at the APD pin, as illustrated in Figure 3.\nFigure 3.

It is essentially a func-tion of the input step-signal levels, since the small signal bandwidth increases with the input signal. At greater than 10μA, the L T3571 APD current mirror typically has several hundred nanoseconds response time. To measure such fast transient response, any capacitor at the APD and the MON pin should be removed. Figure 4 shows a suggested transient response test setup. Choose V\nL and V H, cor-\nresponding to the input step current levels, respectively. At the MON pin, a wideband transimpedence ampliﬁ  er \nis implemented using the L T1815. Operating in a shunt conﬁ guration, the ampliﬁ  er buffers the MON output current \nand dramatically reduces the effective output impedence at the OUT node. Note that there is an inversion and a DC offset present when this measurement technique is used. A regular oscilloscope probe can then be used to capture the fast transient response at the OUT node. APD Bias Voltage Temperature Compensation\nTypically, the APD reverse bias voltage has a positive tem-\nperature coefﬁ  cient. The APD pin voltage can be adjusted \nwith temperature via the CTRL pin. One simple solution is to form a resistor divider from the V\nREF pin to the CTRL \npin, as shown in Figure 5. By carefully choosing the resis-tor values, a temperature coefﬁ  cient can be applied to the \nAPD reverse bias voltage.

High Frequency PathLOADVOUTL1SWITCH\nNODE\n3571 F06VINHIGH\nFREQUENCY\nCIRCULATING\nPATHSetting APD Current Limit \nThe L T3571 has a unique current loop to limit the APD \ncurrent. Choose the sense resistor R SENSE  across V OUT \nand MONIN pins to set the APD current limit by using the following formula:\n \n RSENSE=200mV\n1.2×IAPD(mA) +0.3mA\nwhere I APD is the APD current limit.\nLayout Hints The high speed operation of the L T3571 demands careful \nattention to board layout. Advertised performance will not be achieved with a careless layout. To prevent radiation and high frequency resonance problems, proper layout of the high frequency switching path is essential. Keep the output switch (SW pin), diode and output capacitor as close together as possible. Minimize the length and area \nof all traces connected to the switch pin, and always use a ground plane under the switching regulator to minimize interplane coupling. The high speed switching current path is shown in Figure 6. The signal path, including the switch, output diode and output capacitor contains nanosecond rise and fall times and should be kept as short as possible.\nLT3571\n133571faTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nC1\n1μFC547nF\nMONINVREF\nRTSHDN\nCTRL\nGNDMONVOUT\nFBVIN SW\nL T3571\nSYNC APDVIN\n5V\nR2\n13.7k\nR449.9Ω\nR310kR5\n20k\n69V , 2mAC5\n10nFR\nSENSE\n20Ω\n3571 TA03aC4\n0.1μFC3\n10nF\nRT\n33.2k\n400kHz\nL: TDK VLF4012AT-220MR51\nC1: TDK X7R C1608X7R1C105KTC2: MURATA X7R GRM21AR72A224KAC5LC3: AVX X7R 06031C103KC4: MURATA X7R GRM188R72A104KA35C5: MURATA X7R GRM155R7H103KC6: MURATA X7R GCM155R471C473K74V\nC2\n0.22μFL1\n22μH\nR11M EXTERNAL\nCONTROL BLOCK5V to 69V APD Bias Supply with Soft-Start\nADP CURRENT (mA)0INPUT POWER (mW)500\n50450\n350250\n150400\n300\n200100\n0\n1\n3571 TA03c2 1.5 0.5\nIAPD = 1mA 2μs/DIV3571 TA03b2mV/DIVAPD Bias Ripple Input Power vs APD Current\nLT3571\n143571faTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nC1\n1μFMONINVREF\nRTSHDN\nCTRL\nGNDSYNCVOUT\nFBVIN SW\nL T3571\nMON APDOFF  ONVIN\n5V\nR2\n15k\nR449.9Ω50VRT\n33.2k\n400kHzRSENSE\n50Ω\n3571 TA04aC4\n0.1μFC3\n10nF\nR3\n10kC5\n10nFQ1\nL1: TDK VLF4012AT – 150MR63\nC1: TDK X7R C1608X7R1C105KTC2: MURATA X7R GRM21AR72A224KAC5LC3: AVX X7R 06031C103KC4: MURATA X7R GRM188R72A104KA35C5: MURATA X7R GRM155R71H103KC6: MURATA X7R GRM155R71A104KA01D55V\nC2\n0.22μFL1\n15μH\nR11MR749.9kR5\n30.1k\nR6\n100k\nR920k C60.1μFR8\n36.5kQ2\nTEMPERATURE\nCOMPENSATION BLOCK\nQ1, Q2 = PHILIPS PEMT15V to 50V APD Bias Power Supply with Temperature Compensation\nAPD CURRENT (mA)0INPUT POWER (mW)350\n50300\n250\n150\n100200\n0\n1 1.5\n3571 TA04b2 0.5\nTEMPERATURE (°C)–50VAPD (V)60\n4258\n5450\n4656\n5248\n44\n0\n75 25\n3571 TA04c125 50 0 100 –25Input Power vs APD Current Temperature Response\nLT3571\n153571fa\nInformation furnished by Linear Technology Corporation is believed to be accurate and reliable. \nHowever , no responsibility is assumed for its use.
