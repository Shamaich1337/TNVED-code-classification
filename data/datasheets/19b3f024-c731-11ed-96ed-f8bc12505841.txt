VIH(max) = VDD + 0.3 VDC ;  VIH(max) = VDD + 2.0 VAC (pulse width ≤ 10 ns) for I ≤ 20.0 mA.\n3. VIL(min) = -0.5 VDC ; VIL(min) = -2.0 VAC (pulse width ≤ 10 ns) for I ≤ 20.0 mA.Table 4 – Operating ConditionsOPERATING CONDITIONS\nMR0A08B Rev. 8.6, 3/20188\nCopyright © 2018 Everspin Technologies   MR0A08BThe MRAM is protected from write operations whenever VDD is less than VWI. As soon as VDD exceeds \nVDD(min), there is a startup time of 2 ms before read or write operations can start. This time allows memory \npower supplies to stabilize. \nThe E and W control signals should track VDD on power up to VDD- 0.2 V or VIH (whichever is lower) and \nremain high for the startup time. In most systems, this means that these signals should be pulled up with a \nresistor so that signal remains high if the driving signal is Hi-Z during power up.  Any logic that drives E and \nW should hold the signals high with a power-on reset signal for longer than the startup time. \nDuring power loss or brownout where VDD goes below VWI, writes are protected and a startup time must be \nobserved when power returns above VDD(min).\nBROWNOUT or  POWER LOSS\nNORMAL\n OPERATIONVDD\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITEDVWI\n2 ms\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITED\nVIH STARTUP\nNORMAL\n OPERATION2 ms\nE\nWRECOVER\nVIH Figure 3 – Power Up and Power Down DiagramPower Up and Power Down Sequencing\nMR0A08B\nMR0A08B Rev. 8.6, 3/20189\nCopyright © 2018 Everspin Technologies   Parameter Symbol Min Typical Max Unit\nInput leakage current Ilkg(I)- - ±1 μA\nOutput leakage current Ilkg(O)- - ±1 μA\nOutput low voltage\n(IOL = +4 mA)\n(IOL = +100 μA)VOL- -0.4\nVSS + 0.2V\nOutput high voltage\n(IOL = -4 mA)\n(IOL = -100 μA)VOH2.4\nVDD - 0.2- - VTable 5 – DC Characteristics\nTable 6 – Power Supply Characteristics\nParameter Symbol Typical Max Unit\nAC active supply current - read modes 1\n(IOUT= 0 mA, VDD= max)IDDR25 30 mA\nAC active supply current - write modes 1\n(VDD= max)\nMR0A08B (Commercial)\nMR0A08BC (Industrial)IDDW55\n5565\n70mA\nAC standby current \n(VDD= max, E = VIH)\nno other restrictions on other inputsISB16 7 mA\nCMOS standby current\n( E  ≥  VDD - 0.2 V and VIn ≤ VSS + 0.2 V or ≥ VDD - 0.2 V )\n( VDD = max, f = 0 MHz )ISB25 6 mA\nNotes:\n1.

### Component Summary: MR0A08BCMA35

**Description:**
The MR0A08BCMA35 is a 1,048,576-bit (1 Mb) magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) device from Everspin Technologies. It is organized as 131,072 words of 8 bits each. This MRAM offers SRAM-compatible read/write timing of 35 ns and features unlimited endurance, making it suitable for applications requiring fast and reliable non-volatile memory.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VDD): 3.0 V to 3.6 V
  - Write Inhibit Voltage (VWI): 2.5 V to 3.0 V
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Active Supply Current (Read): 25 mA (typical)
  - Active Supply Current (Write): 55 mA (commercial), 65 mA (industrial)
  - Standby Current: 7 mA (typical)
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Power Dissipation: 0.6 W (maximum)
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Commercial: 0 °C to +70 °C
  - Industrial: -40 °C to +85 °C
- **Package Type:**
  - 44-pin TSOP II (400-mil)
  - 48-ball BGA (0.75 mm ball centers)
- **Special Features:**
  - Native non-volatility with data retention for over 20 years
  - Unlimited read/write endurance
  - Low-voltage inhibit circuitry to protect data during power loss
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL-3 per JEDEC J-STD-020E

**Typical Applications:**
The MR0A08BCMA35 is ideal for applications that require fast, reliable, and non-volatile memory solutions. Typical applications include:
- **Data Storage:** Used in systems that need to store critical data permanently.
- **Embedded Systems:** Suitable for microcontrollers and other embedded applications where data integrity is crucial.
- **Industrial Automation:** Employed in environments where data must be retained across power cycles.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Utilized in devices that require quick access to stored data without the need for battery backup.

This component effectively replaces traditional memory types such as FLASH, SRAM, and EEPROM, simplifying design and improving reliability in various electronic systems.
