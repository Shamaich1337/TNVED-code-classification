### Component Summary: 9FGV0641AKLF

**Description:**
The 9FGV0641 is a 16-output very low-power PCIe clock generator designed for PCIe Gen 1-4 applications. It features integrated 100Ω output terminations for direct connection to 100Ω transmission lines, making it suitable for various high-speed data communication applications. The device supports multiple output enables for clock management and offers different spread spectrum levels to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VDDxx): 1.7V to 1.9V
  - Output Supply Voltage (VDDIO): 1.05V to 1.8V
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Typical Power Consumption: 54mW
  - IDDAOP (All outputs active @ 100MHz): 6.2 to 9 mA
  - IDDIOOP (All outputs active @ 100MHz): 23 to 30 mA
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Typical: 54mW
  - Power Down Current: 0.4 to 1 mA (VDDA)
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Commercial: 0°C to 70°C
  - Industrial: -40°C to 85°C
- **Package Type:**
  - 40-VFQFPN, 5 x 5 mm
- **Special Features:**
  - Integrated 100Ω output terminations
  - Programmable slew rate and output amplitude
  - Wake-On-LAN (WOL) support
  - Selectable spread spectrum levels (0%, -0.25%, -0.5%)
  - SMBus interface for configuration
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level: 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The 9FGV0641 is primarily used in:
- PCIe Gen 1-4 clock generation for:
  - Riser Cards
  - Storage devices
  - Networking equipment
  - JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks)
  - Communications systems
  - Access Points

This component is ideal for applications requiring precise clock generation with low power consumption and minimal thermal output, making it suitable for high-performance computing and data transfer environments.
