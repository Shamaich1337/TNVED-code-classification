The family of devices complies with USB standards and is available with both polarities of enable input. \n \nThe devices have fast short-circuit response time for improved overall \nsystem robustness, and have integrated output discharge function to ensure completely controlled discharging of the output voltage capacitor. They provide a complete protection solution for applications \nsubject to heavy capacitive loads and the prospect of short circuit, \nand offer reverse current blocking, over-current, over-temperature and short-circuit protection, as we ll as controlled rise time and \nunder-voltage lockout functionality. A 7ms deglitch capability on the open-drain Flag output prevents false over-current reporting and does \nnot require any external components. AP2401 and AP2411 will be latched off after 7ms deglitch. \n \nAll devices are available in SO-8, MSOP-8, MSOP-8EP, U-DFN3030-8 and U-DFN2020-6 packages. \n \nFeatures \n\uf0b7 Single Channel Current-Limited Power Switch \n\uf0b7 Output Discharge Function \n\uf0b7 Output Current Latch-Off when OCP Triggered \n\uf0b7 Fast Short-Circuit Response Time: 2µs \n\uf0b7 2.5A Accurate Current Limiting \n\uf0b7 Reverse Current Blocking \n\uf0b7 70mΩ On-Resistance \n\uf0b7 Input Voltage Range: 2.7V - 5.5V \n\uf0b7 Built-In Soft-Start with 0.6ms Typical Rise Time  \n\uf0b7 Over-Current and Thermal Protection \n\uf0b7 Fault Report (FLG) with Blanking Time (7ms typ) \n\uf0b7 ESD Protection: 2kV HBM, 200V MM \n\uf0b7 Active Low (AP2401) or Active High (AP2411) Enable \n\uf0b7 Ambient Temperature Range: -40°C to +85°C \n\uf0b7 SO-8, MSOP-8, MSOP-8EP, U-DFN3030-8 and U-DFN2020-6: \nAvailable in “Green” Molding Compound (No Br, Sb) \n\uf0b7 Lead-Free Finish; RoHS Compliant (Notes 1 & 2)  \n\uf0b7 Halogen and Antimony Free. “Green” Device (Note 3) \xa0\n\uf0b7 UL Recognized, File Number E322375 \n\uf0b7 IEC60950-1 CB Scheme Certified  Pin Assignments \n \nGND\nIN\nIN\nEN FLGOUTOUTNC\n4321\n5678(Top View)\nSO-8  \nFLGOUTOUTNC GND\nIN\nIN\nEN(Top View)\nMSOP-8/MSOP-8EP\nNote: Latter with exposed pad\n(dotted line)8\n7\n6\n51\n2\n3\n4\n \n \nFLGOUTOUTNC GND\nIN\nIN\nEN1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5(Top View)\nU-DFN3030-8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nU-DFN2020-6 \n \nApplications \n\uf0b7 LCD TVs & Monitors \n\uf0b7 Set-Top-Boxes, Residential Gateways \n\uf0b7 Laptops, Desktops, Servers, e-Readers \n\uf0b7 Printers, Docking Stations, HUBs \n \n \nNotes: 1.

2  10 of 18 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2013\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2401/AP2411\n \n \nApplication Information \nPower Supply Considerations \nA 0.1μF to 2.2μF X7R or X5R ceramic bypass capacitor placed between IN and GN D, close to the device, is recommended. When an external \npower supply is used, or an additional ferri te bead is added to the input, high inrush current may cause voltage spikes higher than the device \nmaximum input rating during short circ uit condition. In this case a 2.2 μF or bigger capacitor is recommended. Placing a high-val ue electrolytic \ncapacitor on the input and output pin(s) is recommended when the out put load is heavy. This precaut ion reduces power-supply tra nsients that \nmay cause ringing on the input. Additiona lly, bypassing the output with a 0.1 μF to 1.0μF ceramic capacitor improves the immunity of the device \nto short circuit transients. \n \nOver-Current and Short Circuit Protection  \nAn internal sensing FET is employed to c heck for over-current conditions. Unlike curr ent-sense resistors, sense FETs do not inc rease the series \nresistance of the current path. When an overcurrent condition is detected, the devices will limit the current until the overloa d condition is removed \nor the internal deglitch time (7-ms typical) is reached and t he device is turned off. The device will remain latched off even o verload condition is \nremoved until power is cycled or  the device enable is toggled. \nThree possible overload conditions can occur. In the first condition, the output has  been shorted to GND before the device is e nabled or before \nVIN has been applied. The AP2401/AP2411 senses t he short circuit and immediat ely clamps output current to a certain safe level namely I LIMIT, \nand turns off after deglitch time(7-ms typical). \nIn the second condition, an output short or an overload occurs while the device is enabled. At the instance the overload occurs , higher current \nmay flow for a very short period of time before the current lim it function can react. After the current limit function has trip ped (reached the       \nover-current trip threshold), the device switches into current limiting mode and the current is clamped at I LIMIT current for deglitch time period     \n(7-ms typical), and then turned off.  \nIn the third condition, the load has been gradually increased bey ond the recommended operating current. The current is permitte d to rise until the \ncurrent-limit threshold (I TRIG) is reached or until the thermal limit of the device is  exceeded. The AP2401/AP2411 is capable of delivering current \nup to the current-limit threshold without damaging the device. On ce the threshold has been reached, the device switches into it s current limiting \nmode and output current is clamped at I LIMIT for deglitch time period (7-ms typical), and then turned off. \n \nFLG Response  \nWhen an over-current or over-temperature s hutdown condition is encountered, the FLG op en-drain output goes active low after a n ominal 7-ms \ndeglitch timeout.   \nWhen that happens, the FLG will remain low and the switch will be latched off until the fault c ondition is removed. Connecting a heavy capacitive \nload to the output of the device can cause a momentary over-current condition, which does  not trigger the FLG due to the 7-ms d eglitch timeout. \nThe AP2401/AP2411 is designed to eliminate fals e over-current reporting without the need of external components to remove unwan ted pulses. \n \nPower Dissipation and Junction Temperature \nThe low on-resistance of the internal MOSFET allows the small surface-mount packages to pass la rge current. Using the maximum o perating \nambient temperature (TA) and R DS(ON), the power dissipation can be calculated by: \n \nPD = R DS(ON)× I2 \n \nFinally, calculate the junction temperature: \nTJ = P D x R\uf071JA + T A \nWhere: \nTA= Ambient temperature°C \nR\uf071JA = Thermal resistance \nPD = Total power dissipation \n \nThermal Protection  \nThermal protection prevents the IC from damage when heavy-overload or short-circuit faults are present for extended periods of time. The \nAP2401/AP2411 implements a thermal sensing to monitor the operati ng junction temperature of the power distribution switch. Once  the die \ntemperature rises to approximately +140°C due to excessive power dissipation in an over-current condition, the internal thermal  sense circuitry \nturns the power switch off, thus preventing the power switch from  damage. Hysteresis is built into the thermal sense circuit al lowing the device to \ncool down approximately +25°C before the switch turns back on. T he switch continues to cycle in this manner until the load faul t or input power is \nremoved. The FLG open-drain output is asserted when an over-temperature shutdown occurs with 7-ms deglitch. \nWhen the FLG is asserted, the switch will be latched off until the temperature drops to 20°C below the thermal shutdown thresho ld and the power \nor EN pin is cycled. \n \n \nAP2401/AP2411  \nDocument number: DS35113 Rev. 6 - 2  11 of 18 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2013\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2401/AP2411\n \n \nApplication Information (cont.) \nUnder-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) \nUnder-voltage lockout function (UVLO) keeps the internal power switch from being turned on until the power supply has reached a t least 2V, \neven if the switch is enabled. Whenever the input voltage falls bel ow approximately 2V, the power switch is quickly turned off.  This facilitates the \ndesign of hot-insertion systems where it is  not possible to turn off the power switch before input power is removed. \n \nDischarge Function \nThe discharge function of the dev ice is active when enable is disabled or de-asse rted. The discharge function with the N-MOS po wer switch \nimplementation is activated   and   offers    a resistive discharge path for the exter nal storage capacitor.  This is designed f or discharging any \nresidue of the output voltage when either no external output  resistance or load resistance is present at the output. \n \n \nOrdering Information \n \n \n \nPart  \nNumber Status Package  \nCode Packaging 7”/13” Tape and Reel \nQuantity Part Number Suffix \nAP24X1S-13  New Product S  SO-8  2500/Tape & Reel  -13 \nAP24X1M8-13  New Product M8  MSOP-8  2500/Tape & Reel  -13 \nAP24X1MP-13 New Product MP MSOP-8EP 2500/Tape & Reel -13 \nAP24X1FGE-7  New Product FGE  U-DFN3030-8  3000/Tape & Reel  -7 \nAP24X1SN-7  Preview SN U-DFN2020-6 3000/Tape & Reel  -7 \n \n  \nMarking Information \n \n(1) SO-8 \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \nAP2401/AP2411  \nDocument number: DS35113 Rev. 6 - 2  12 of 18 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2013\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2401/AP2411\n \n \nMarking Information (cont.) \n \n(2) MSOP-8 \n \n \n(3) MSOP-8EP \n \n \n \n(4) U-DFN3030-8  \nXX : Identification Code( Top View )\n X : A~Z : Internal Code XYX X\nW Y : Year : 0~9\n W : Week : A~Z : 1~26 week;\n a~z : 27~52 week; z represents\n52 and 53 week\n \n \n \nPart Number Package Identification Code \nAP2401FGE-7 U-DFN3030-8 BD \nAP2411FGE-7 U-DFN3030-8 BF \n \n \n(5)  U-DFN2020-6 \n \nXX : Identification Code( Top View )\n X : A~Z : Internal Code XYXX\nW Y : Year : 0~9\n W : Week : A~Z : 1~26 week;\n a~z : 27~52 week; z represents\n52 and 53 week\n \n \nPart Number Package Identification Code \nAP2401SN-7 U-DFN2020-6  DD \nAP2411SN-7 U-DFN2020-6  DF \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n\n \nAP2401/AP2411  \nDocument number: DS35113 Rev. 6 - 2  13 of 18 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2013\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2401/AP2411\n \n \nPackage Outline Dimensions (All dimensions in mm.)   \nPlease see AP02002 at http://www.diodes.com /datasheets/ap02002.pdf for latest version.  \n \n1.
