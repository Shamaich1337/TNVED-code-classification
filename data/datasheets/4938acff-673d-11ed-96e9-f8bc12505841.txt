A low-drift, temperature-\ncompensated signal chain provides < 1% full-scale \nerror across the device temperature range.\nThe input current flows through an internal 1.8-m Ω \nconductor that generates a magnetic field measured \nby an integrated Hall-effect sensor. This structure \neliminates external concentrators and simplifies \ndesign. Low conductor resistance minimizes power \nloss and thermal dissipation. Inherent galvanic \ninsulation provides a 600-V lifetime working voltage \nand 3-kV RMS basic isolation between the current path \nand circuitry. Integrated electrical shielding enables \nexcellent common-mode rejection and transient \nimmunity.\nThe output voltage is proportional to the input current \nwith four sensitivity options. Fixed sensitivity allows \nthe TMCS1100  to operate from a single 3-V to 5.5-\nV power supply, eliminates ratiometry errors, and \nimproves supply noise rejection. The current polarity \nis considered positive when flowing into the positive \ninput pin. The VREF input pin provides a variable \nzero-current output voltage, enabling bidirectional or \nunidirectional current sensing.\nThe TMCS1100  draws a maximum supply current of 6 \nmA, and all sensitivity options are specified over the \noperating temperature range of –40°C to +125°C.\nDevice Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTMCS1100 SOIC (8) 4.90 mm × 3.90 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the package option \naddendum at the end of the data sheet.\nBridge Driver Passive / PFC\nRectifierDC V+\nAC\nDC V±\nControllerCurrent\nSenseLoadsxxx\nx\nxx\nxTMCS1100\nTMCS1100\nTMCS1100\nCurrent\nSenseCurrent\nSense Control Control\nTypical ApplicationTMCS1100\nSBOS820B  – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED JULY 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The accuracy of the device is quantified both by the error terms in the transfer \nfunction parameters, as well as by nonidealities that introduce additional error terms not in the simplified linear \nmodel.

When specified over a temperature range, this is the worst-case \nsensitivity error at any temperature within the range.\neS = [(S fit – S ideal) / S ideal] × 100% (2)\nwhere\n•eS is the sensitivity error.\n•Sfit is the best fit sensitivity.\n•SIdeal is the ideal sensitivity.\n8.1.2 Offset Error and Offset Error Drift\nOffset error is the deviation from the ideal output voltage with zero input current through the device. Offset error \ncan be referred to the output as a voltage error V OE or referred to the input as a current offset error I OS. Offset \nerror is a single error source, however, and must only be included once in error calculations.\nThe output voltage offset error of the TMCS1100  is the error in the zero current output voltage from the VREF \npin voltage as in Equation 3 .\nOE OUT,0A REFV V V \x10 \n(3)\nwhere\n•VOUT,0A  is the device output voltage with zero input current.\nThe offset error includes the magnetic offset of the Hall sensor and any offset voltage errors of the signal chain.\nThe input referred (RTI) offset error is the output voltage offset error divided by the sensitivity of the device, \nshown in Equation 4 . Refer the offset error to the input of the device to allow for easier total error calculations \nand direct comparison to input current levels. No matter how the calculations are done, the error sources \nquantified by V OE and I OS are the same, and should only be included once for error calculations.\nOS OEI V / S \n(4)\nOffset error drift is the change in the input-referred offset error per degree Celsius change in ambient \ntemperature. This parameter is reported in µA/°C.

Due to magnetic coupling and galvanic isolation of the current signal, the TMCS1100 \nhas very high rejection of input common-mode voltage.

Ideally, the zero \ncurrent output voltage directly tracks V REF. Light internal mismatch can cause minor errors, however. When the \nreference voltage deviates from half of the supply, an additional effective output offset error is introduced into \nthe device transfer function. The reference voltage rejection ratio (RVRR) is the effective change in output offset \nvoltage due to this deviation.

The total sensitivity (S) of the device is \ncomprised of the initial transformation of input current to magnetic field quantified as the magnetic coupling factor \n(G), as well as the sensitivity of the Hall element and the analog circuitry that is factory calibrated to provide \na final sensitivity. The output voltage is proportional to the input current by the device sensitivity, as defined in \nEquation 11 .\nHall V S G * S * A \n(11)\nwhere\n•S is the TMCS1100  sensitivity in mV/A.\n•G is the magnetic coupling factor in mT/A.\n•SHall is the sensitivity of the Hall plate in mV/mT.\n•AV is the calibrated analog circuitry gain in V/V.\nAn external field, B EXT, is measured by the Hall sensor and signal chain, in addition to the field generated by the \nleadframe current, and is added as an extra input term in the total output voltage function:\nOUT EXT Hall V IN Hall V OUT,0AV B * S * A I * G * S * A V \x0e \x0e\n(12)\nObservable from Equation 12  is that the impact of an external field is an additional equivalent input current \nsignal, I BEXT, shown in Equation 13 . This effective additional input current has no dependence on Hall or analog \ncircuitry sensitivity, so all gain variants have equivalent input-referred current error due to external magnetic \nfields.\nEXTEXT\nBBIG \n(13)\nThis additional current error generates a percentage error defined by Equation 14 .\nEXTEXT\nB\nINB\nGe (%)I \n(14)\n8.2 Transient Response Parameters\nThe transient response of the TMCS1100  is impacted by the 250 kHz sampling rate as defined in Transient \nResponse . Figure 8-2  shows the TMCS1100  response to an input current step sufficient to generate a 1V output \nchange. The typical 4us sampling window can be observed as a periodic step. This sampling window dominates \nthe response of the device, and the response will have some probabilistic nature due to alignment of the input \nstep and the sampling window interval.TMCS1100\nSBOS820B – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMCS1100\nTime (4Ps/div)Input Current (A)\nOutput Voltage (V)\n-15 0.50 115 1.530 245 2.560 375 3.590 4\nIIN\nV1\nV2Figure 8-2.

Because the device often requires two sampling windows to reach a full 90% settling of its final \nvalue, this slew rate is not equal to the 10%-90% transition time for the full output swing.\ntrInput Current\n10%90%\ntpSR\nVOUT response1VtrInput Current\n10%90%\ntpSRVOUT response1VtrInput Current\n10%90%\ntpSRVOUT response1V4\x1ds Sample \nWindow4\x1ds Sample \nWindow 4\x1ds Sample \nWindow\nFigure 8-3. Small Current Input Step Transient Response\n8.2.2 Propagation Delay and Response Time\nPropagation delay is the time period between the input current waveform reaching 10% of its final value and \nVOUT reaching 10% of its final value. This propagation delay is heavily dependent upon the alignment of the \ninput current step and the sampling period of the TMCS1100 , as shown for several different sampling window \ncases in Figure 8-3 .\nResponse time is the time period between the input current reaching 90% of its final value and the output \nreaching 90% of its final value, for an input current step sufficient to cause a 1-V transition on the output. Figure \n8-3 shows the response time of the TMCS1100  under three different time cases. Unless a step input occurs \ndirectly during the beginning of one sampling window the response time will include two sampling intervals.\n8.2.3 Current Overload Parameters\nCurrent overload response parameters are the transient behavior of the TMCS1100  to an input current step \nconsistent with a short circuit or fault event. Tested amplitude is twice the full scale range of the device, or 10V / \nSensitivity in V/A. Under these conditions, the TMCS1100  output will respond faster than in the case of a small \ninput current step due to the higher input amplitude signal. Response time and propagation delay are measured \nin a similar manner to the case of a small input current step, as shown in Figure 8-4 .www.ti.comTMCS1100\nSBOS820B – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TMCS1100\ntrInput Current\n10%90%\ntpSRVOUT responseû\x03IIN = \n10 V / SFigure 8-4.

The transient response of the device during this recovery period from a current overload is \nshown in Figure 7-19 .\n8.2.4 CMTI, Common-Mode Transient Immunity\nCMTI is the capability of the device to tolerate a rising/falling voltage step on the input without disturbance on \nthe output signal. The device is specified for the maximum common-mode transition rate under which the output \nsignal will not experience a greater than 200-mV disturbance that lasts longer than 1 µs. Higher edge rates than \nthe specified CMTI can be supported with sufficient filtering or blanking time after common-mode transitions.TMCS1100\nSBOS820B – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMCS1100\n8.3 Safe Operating Area\nThe isolated input current safe operating area (SOA) of the TMCS1100  is constrained by self-heating due to \npower dissipation in the input conductor. Depending upon the use case, the SOA is constrained by multiple \nconditions, including exceeding maximum junction temperature, Joule heating in the leadframe, or leadframe \nfusing under extremely high currents. These mechanisms depend on pulse duration, amplitude, and device \nthermal states.\nCurrent SOA strongly depends on the thermal environment and design of the system-level board. Multiple \nthermal variables control the transfer of heat from the device to the surrounding environment, including air \nflow, ambient temperature, and printed-circuit board (PCB) construction and design. All ratings are for a single \nTMCS1100  device on the TMCS1100EVM , with no air flow in the specified ambient temperature conditions. \nDevice use profiles must satisfy both continuous conduction and short-duration transient SOA capabilities for the \nthermal environment under which the system will be operated.\n8.3.1 Continuous DC or Sinusoidal AC Current\nThe longest thermal time constants of device packaging and PCBs are in the order of seconds; therefore, \nany continuous DC or sinusoidal AC periodic waveform with a frequency higher than 1 Hz can be evaluated \nbased on the RMS continuous-current level. The continuous-current capability has a strong dependence upon \nthe operating ambient temperature range expected in operation. Figure 8-5  shows the maximum continuous \ncurrent-handling capability of the device on the TMCS1100EVM . Current capability falls off at higher ambient \ntemperatures because of the reduced thermal transfer from junction-to-ambient and increased power dissipation \nin the leadframe. By improving the thermal design of an application, the SOA can be extended to higher currents \nat elevated temperatures. Using larger and heavier copper power planes, providing air flow over the board, or \nadding heat sinking structures to the area of the device can all improve thermal performance.\nAmbient Temperature ( qC)Maximum Continuous RMS Current (A)\n-55 -35 -15 5 25 45 65 85 105 125101520253035\nD012\nFigure 8-5.

The TMCS1100  can tolerate higher current ranges under \nsome conditions, however, for repetitive pulsed events, the current levels must satisfy both the pulsed current \nSOA and the RMS continuous current constraint. Pulse duration, duty cycle, and ambient temperate all impact \nthe SOA for repetitive pulsed events.

The \nconductor has a 1.8-m Ω resistance at room temperature for low power dissipation and a 20-A RMS continuous \ncurrent handling capability up to 105°C ambient temperature on the TMCS1100EVM . The low-ohmic leadframe \npath reduces power dissipation compared to alternative current measurement methodologies, and does not \nrequire any external passive components, isolated supplies, or control signals on the high-voltage side. The \nmagnetic field generated by the input current is sensed by a Hall sensor and amplified by a precision signal \nchain. The device can be used for both AC and DC current measurements and has a bandwidth of 80 kHz. \nThere are multiple fixed-sensitivity device variants for a wide option of linear sensing ranges, and the TMCS1100 \ncan operate with a low voltage supply from 3 V to 5.5 V. The TMCS1100  is optimized for high accuracy \nand temperature stability, with both offset and sensitivity compensated across the entire operating temperature \nrange.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\nIN+\nIN±Hall \nElement \nBiasTemperature \nCompensation\n----------------------\nOffset Cancellation\nVREFVOUTPrecision\nAmplifierOutput\nAmplifierIsolation BarrierVS\nGNDReference\nSampling\n9.3 Feature Description\n9.3.1 Current Input\nInput current to the TMCS1100  passes through the isolated side of the package leadframe through the IN+ \nand IN– pins. The current flow through the package generates a magnetic field that is proportional to the input \ncurrent, and measured by a galvanically isolated, precision, Hall sensor IC. As a result of the electrostatic \nshielding on the Hall sensor die, only the magnetic field generated by the input current is measured, thus limiting \ninput voltage switching pass-through to the circuitry. This configuration allows for direct measurement of currents \nwith high-voltage transients without signal distortion on the current-sensor output. The leadframe conductor has \na nominal resistance of 1.8 m Ω at 25°C, and has a typical positive temperature coefficient as defined in the \nElectrical Characteristics table.\n9.3.2 Input Isolation\nThe separation between the input conductor and the Hall sensor die due to the TMCS1100  construction \nprovides inherent galvanic isolation between package pins 1-4 and pins 5-8. Insulation capability is defined \naccording to certification agency definitions and using industry-standard test methods as defined in the Insulation \nSpecifications table. Assessment of device lifetime working voltages follow the VDE 0884-11 standard for basic \ninsulation, requiring time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) data-projection failure rates of less than 1000 \npart per million (ppm), and a minimum insulation lifetime of 20 years. The VDE standard also requires an \nadditional safety margin of 20% for working voltage, and a 30% margin for insulation lifetime, translating into a \nminimum required lifetime of 26 years at 509 V RMS for the TMCS1100 .TMCS1100\nSBOS820B – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMCS1100\nFigure 9-1  shows the intrinsic capability of the isolation barrier to withstand high-voltage stress over the lifetime \nof the device. Based on the TDDB data, the intrinsic capability of these devices is 424 V RMS with a lifetime of\n> 100 years. Other factors such as operating environment and pollution degree can further limit the working \nvoltage of the component in an end system.\nFigure 9-1. Insulation Lifetime\n9.3.3 High-Precision Signal Chain\nThe TMCS1100  uses a precision, low-drift signal chain with proprietary sensor linearization techniques to \nprovide a highly accurate and stable current measurement across the full temperature range of the device. \nThe device is fully tested and calibrated at the factory to account for any variations in either silicon or packaging \nprocess variations. The full signal chain provides a fixed sensitivity voltage output that is proportional to the \ncurrent through the leadframe of the isolated input.\n9.3.3.1 Temperature Stability\nThe TMCS1100  includes a proprietary temperature compensation technique which results in significantly \nimproved parametric drift across the full temperature range. This compensation technique accounts for changes \nin ambient temperature, self-heating, and package stress. A zero-drift signal chain architecture and Hall sensor \ntemperature stabilization methods enable stable sensitivity and minimize offset errors across temperature, and \ndrastically improves system-level performance across the required operating conditions.\nFigure 9-2  shows  the offset error across the full device ambient temperature range. Figure 9-3  shows  the typical \nsensitivity. There are no other external components introducing errors sources; therefore, the high intrinsic \naccuracy and stability over temperature directly translates to system-level performance. As a result of this high \nprecision, even a system with no calibration can reach < 1% of total error current-sensing capability.\nTemperature (°C)Input Current Offset (mA)\n-50 -25 0 25 50 75 100 125 150-80-60-40-20020406080\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nFigure 9-2.

Typical magnetic sensors suffer from up to 2% \nto 3% of sensitivity drift due to aging at high operating temperatures. The TMCS1100  has greatly improved \nlifetime drift, as defined in the Electrical Characteristics for total sensitivity error measured after the worst \ncase stress test during a three lot AEC-Q100 qualification. All other stress tests prescribed by an AEC-Q100 \nqualification caused lower than the specified sensitivity error, and were within the bounds specified within the \nElectrical Characteristics table. Figure 9-4  shows the total sensitivity error after the worst-case stress test, a \nHighly Accelerated Stress Test (HAST) at 130°C and 85% relative humidity (RH), while Figure 9-5  and Figure \n9-6 show the sensitivity and offset error drift after a 1000 hour, 125°C high temperature operating life stress \ntest as specified by AEC-Q100.

The 250-kHz sampling interval implies an effective Nyquist frequency of 125 kHz, which limits spectral \nresponse to below this frequency. Higher frequency content than this frequency will be aliased down to lower \nspectrums.\nThe TMCS1100  bandwidth is defined by the –3-dB spectral response of the entire signal chain which is \nconstrained by the sampling frequency.

At the end \nof each integration cycle, the signal propagates to the output. Depending on the alignment of a change in input \ncurrent relative to the sampling window, the output might not settle to the final signal until the second integration \ncycle. Figure 9-9  shows a typical output waveform response to a 10-kHz sine wave input current. For a slowly \nvarying input current signal, the output is a discrete time representation with a phase delay of the integration \nsampling window. Adding a first order filter of 100 kHz effectively smooths the output waveform with minimal \nimpact to phase response.\nTime (s)Output Voltage (V)\nInput Current (A)\n0 -50.5 -41 -31.5 -22 -12.5 03 13.5 24 34.5 45 55.5 6\n0 .00005 .0001 .00015 .0002 .00025\nD015VOUT\nInput CurrentVOUT, 100 kHz Filter\nFigure 9-9.

This condition is likely to \nbe true in the case of a short-circuit or fault event. Figure 9-11  shows an input-current step twice the full scale \nmeasurable range with two output voltage responses illustrating the effect of the sampling window.

Output Voltage Relationship to Input Current With Varying VREF Voltages\nThe input voltage on this pin can be provided by any external voltage source or potential, such as a discrete \nprecision reference, a voltage divider, ADC reference, or ground. The VREF pin is sampled by the internal \ncircuitry at approximately 1 MHz, then buffered and provided to the signal chain of the device. An apparent DC \nload of approximately 1 µA will be observed by the external reference. To prevent errors due to sampling settling, \nkeep the source impedance below the level specified in the Electrical Characteristics table.\n9.3.5 Current-Sensing Measurable Ranges\nThe TMCS1100  can be configured to allow for bidirectional or unidirectional measurable current ranges based \non the external voltage on the VREF pin. The output voltage is limited by V OUT swing to either supply or ground. \nLinear output swing range to both V S and GND is calculated by equations Equation 16  and Equation 17 .\nVOUT,max  = V S – Swing VS (16)\nVOUT,min  = Swing GND (17)\nRearranging the transfer function of the device to solve for input current, and substituting V OUT,max  and V OUT,min \nyields the maximum and minimum measurable input current ranges as shown in Equation 18  and Equation 19 .\nIIN,MAX+  = (V OUT,max  – V REF) / S (18)\nIIN,MAX-  = (V REF – V OUT,min ) / S (19)\nwhere\n•IIN,MAX+  is the maximum linear measurable positive input current.\n•IIN,MAX-  is the maximum linear measurable negative input current.\n•S is the sensitivity of the device variant.\nSetting V REF to the middle of the output swing range provides bidirectional measurement capability, whereas \nsetting V REF close to the ground provides a unidirectional measurement. Custom ranges with nonuniform \npositive and negative input current ranges can be achieved by appropriately scaling the V REF potential relative to \nthe full output voltage range.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\n9.4.1 Power-Down Behavior\nAs a result of the inherent galvanic isolation of the device, very little consideration must be paid to powering \ndown the device, as long as the limits in the Absolute Maximum Ratings table are not exceeded on any pins. \nThe isolated current input and the low-voltage signal chain can be decoupled in operational behavior, as either \ncan be energized with the other shut down, as long as the isolation barrier capabilities are not exceeded. \nThe low-voltage power supply can be powered down while the isolated input is still connected to an active \nhigh-voltage signal or system.www.ti.comTMCS1100\nSBOS820B – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: TMCS1100\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Specific examples and design requirements \nare detailed in the following section.\n10.1.1 Total Error Calculation Examples\nTotal error can be calculated for any arbitrary device condition and current level. Error sources considered \nshould include input-referred offset current, power-supply rejection, input common-mode rejection, sensitivity \nerror, nonlinearity, VREF to V OUT gain error,  and the error caused by any external fields. Compare each of these \nerror sources in percentage terms, as some are significant drivers of error and some have inconsequential \nimpact to current error. Offset ( Equation 20 ), CMRR ( Equation 22 ), PSRR ( Equation 21 ), VREF gain error \n(Equation 23 ), and external field error ( Equation 24 ) are all referred to the input, and so, are divided by the actual \ninput current I IN to calculate percentage errors.

To account for the individual error \nsources that are statistically uncorrelated, a root sum square (RSS) error calculation should be used to calculate \ntotal error. For the TMCS1100 , only the input referred offset current (I OS), CMRR, and PSRR are statistically \ncorrelated. These error terms are lumped in an RSS calculation to reflect this nature, as shown in Equation 26 \nfor room temperature and Equation 27  for across a given temperature range.

Key figures of merit for any current-measurement system include the total error \npercentage at full-scale current, as well as the dynamic range of input current over which the error remains \nbelow some key level.

A \nprimary challenge to inline sensing is that the current sensor is subjected to full HV supply-level PWM transients \ndriving the load. The inherent isolation of an in-package Hall-effect current sensor topology helps overcome \nthis challenge, providing high common-mode immunity, as well as isolation between the high-voltage motor \ndrive levels and the low-voltage control circuitry. Figure 10-2  illustrates the use of the TMCS1100  in such an \napplication, driving the inductive load presented by a three phase motor.\nFigure 10-2. Inline Motor Phase Current Sensing\n10.2.1 Design Requirements\nFor current sensing of a three-phase motor application, make sure to provide linear sensing across the expected \ncurrent range, and make sure that the device remains within working thermal constraints. A single TMCS1100 \nfor each phase can be used, or two phases can be measured, and the third phase calculated on the motor-\ncontroller host processor. For this example, consider a nominal supply of 5 V but a minimum of 4.9 V to include \nfor some supply variation.

Further consideration of noise and integration with an ADC can be \nexplored, but is beyond the scope of this application design example.

Manipulating Equation 28  and using the linear range defined by V OUT,max , \nVOUT,min , and the full-scale input current, I IN,FS, calculate the maximum and minimum V REF voltages allowed to \nremain within the linear measurement range, shown in Equation 33  and Equation 34 .\n \x10 uREF,max OUT,max IN,FSV V I S\n(33)\n \x0e uREF,min OUT,min IN,FSV V I S\n(34)\nAny value of V REF can be chosen between V REF,max  and V REF,min  to maintain the required linear sensing range. \nIf the allowable V REF range is not wide enough or does not include a desired V REF voltage, the analysis must \nbe repeated with a lower sensitivity variant of the TMCS1100 .

Multiple \nimplementations are possible, but could include:\n•Resistor divider from the supply voltage\n•Resistor divider from an ADC full-scale reference\n•Dedicated or preexisting voltage reference IC\n•DAC or reference voltage from a system microcontroller\nEach of these options has benefits, and the error terms, noise, simplicity, and cost of each implementation must \nbe weighed. In the current design example, any of these options are potentially available as a 2.5-V V REF is \nmidrail of the power supply, a common IC reference voltage, and might already be available in the system. If the \nprimary consideration for the current application design is to maximize precision while minimizing temperature \ndrift and noise, a dedicated voltage reference must be chosen.

Application Example Design Transfer Curve\n11 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe TMCS1100  only requires a power supply (V S) on the low-voltage isolated side, which powers the analog \ncircuitry independent of the isolated current input. V S determines the full-scale output range of the analog \noutput V OUT, and can be supplied with any voltage between 3 V and 5.5 V. To filter noise in the power-supply \npath, place a low-ESR decoupling capacitor of 0.1 µF between V S and GND pins as close as possible to the \nsupply and ground pins of the device. To compensate for noisy or high-impedance power supplies, add more \ndecoupling capacitance.\nThe TMCS1100  power supply V S can be sequenced independently of current flowing through the input. \nHowever, there is a typical 25-ms delay between V S reaching the recommended operating voltage and the \nanalog output being valid. Within this delay V OUT transfers from a high impedance state to the active drive state, \nduring which time the output voltage could transition between GND and V S. If this behavior must be avoided, a \nstable supply voltage to V S should be provided for longer than 25 ms prior to applying input current.TMCS1100\nSBOS820B – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED JULY 2021 www.ti.com\n38 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TMCS1100\n12 Layout\n12.1 Layout Guidelines\nThe TMCS1100  is specified for a continuous current handling capability on the TMCS1100EVM , which uses 3-oz \ncopper pour planes. This current capability is fundamentally limited by the maximum device junction temperature \nand the thermal environment, primarily the PCB layout and design. To maximize current-handling capability and \nthermal stability of the device, take care with PCB layout and construction to optimize the thermal capability. \nEfforts to improve the thermal performance beyond the design and construction of the TMCS1100EVM  can \nresult in increased continuous-current capability due to higher heat transfer to the ambient environment. Keys to \nimproving thermal performance of the PCB include:\n•Use large copper planes for both input current path and isolated power planes and signals.\n•Use heavier copper PCB construction.\n•Place thermal via farms  around the isolated current input.\n•Provide airflow across the surface of the PCB.\nThe TMCS1100  senses external magnetic fields, so make sure to minimize adjacent high-current traces in close \nproximity to the device. The input current trace can contribute additional magnetic field to the sensor if the input \ncurrent traces are routed parallel to the vertical axis of the package. Figure 12-1  illustrates the most optimal \ninput current routing into the TMCS1100 . As the angle that the current approaches the device deviates from 0° \nto the horizontal axis, the current trace contributes some additional magnetic field to the sensor, increasing the \neffective sensitivity of the device. If current must be routed parallel to the package vertical axis, move the routing \naway from the package to minimize the impact to the sensitivity of the device. Terminate the input current path \ndirectly underneath the package lead footprint, and use a merged copper input trace for both the IN+ and IN– \ninputs.\nIIN,}\x17 \nIIN,0\x17 1 IN+ 8  VS\n2 IN+ 7  VOUT\n3 IN± 6  VREF\n4 IN± 5  GND\nIIN,}\x17 IIN,0\x17 }\n}\nFigure 12-1. Magnetic Field Generated by Input Current Trace\nIn addition to thermal and magnetic optimization, make sure to consider the PCB design required creepage and \nclearance for system-level isolation requirements. Maintain required creepage between solder stencils, as shown \nin Figure 12-2 , if possible. If not possible to maintain required PCB creepage between the two isolated sides at \nboard level, add additional slots or grooves to the board. If more creepage and clearance is required for system \nisolation levels than is provided by the package, the entire device and solder mask can be encapsulated with an \novermold compound to meet system-level requirements.www.ti.comTMCS1100\nSBOS820B – SEPTEMBER 2019 – REVISED JULY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 39\nProduct Folder Links: TMCS1100\n VOUT\n VREFCu Plane\nCu PlaneIN+\nIN± VS\n GNDSolder Mask Creepage\nCu Plane\nCu PlaneFigure 12-2.
