Description\nThe Adesto® AT25DF041B is a serial interface Flash memory device designed for use in a wide variety of high-volume consumer \nbased applications in which program code is shadowed from Flash  memory into embedded or exter nal RAM for execution. The \nflexible erase architecture of the AT25DF041B, with its page er ase granularity it is ideal for data storage as well, eliminati ng the \nneed for additional data storage devices.\nThe erase block sizes of the AT25DF041B have been optimized to meet the needs of today\'s code and data storage applications. \nBy optimizing the size of the erase blocks, the memory space can be used much more efficiently. Because certain code modules \nand data storage segments must reside by themselves in their own erase regions, the wasted and unused memory space that \noccurs with large sectored and large block erase Flash memory devices can be greatly reduced. This increased memory space \nefficiency allows additional code routines and data storage seg ments to be added while still maintaining the same overall devi ce \ndensity.\nThe device also contains a specialized OTP (One-Time Programmab le) Security Register that can be used for purposes such as \nunique device serialization, system-level Electronic Serial Num ber (ESN) storage, locked key storage, etc.\nSpecifically designed for use in many different systems, the AT 25DF041B supports read, program, and erase operations with a \nwide supply voltage range of 1.65V to 3.6V. No separate voltage is required for programming and erasing.\n2. Pin Descriptions and Pinouts\nTable 2-1. Pin Descriptions \nSymbol Name and FunctionAsserted\nState Type\nCSCHIP SELECT:  Asserting the CS  pin selects the device. When the CS  pin is deasserted, the \ndevice will be deselected and normally be placed in standby mod e (not Deep Power-Down \nmode), and the SO pin will be in a high-impedance state. When t he device is deselected, data \nwill not be accepted on the SI pin.\nA high-to-low tr ansition on the CS  pin is required to start an operation, and a low-to-high \ntransition is required to end a n operation. When ending an inte rnally self-timed operation such \nas a program or erase cycle, the  device wil l not enter  the stan dby mode until the completion of \nthe operation.Low Input\nSCKSERIAL CLOCK:  This pin is used to provide a clock to the device and is used to control the flow \nof data to and from the device. C ommand, address, and input data present on the SI pin is \nalways latched in on the rising edge of SCK, while output data on the SO pin is always clocked \nout on the falling edge of SCK.- Input\nSI (I/O0)SERIAL INPUT: The SI pin is used to shift data into the device. The SI pin i s used for all data \ninput including command and address sequences. Data on the SI p in is always latched in on the \nrising edge of SCK.With the Dual-Output Read commands , the SI Pin becomes an output pin (I/O\n0) in conjunction \nwith other pins to allow two bits of data on (I/O1-0) to be clocked out on every falling edge of SCK.\nTo maintain consistency with the SPI nomenclature, the SI (I/O0) pin will be referenced as the SI \npin unless specifically addressing the Dual-I/O modes in which case it will be referenced as I/O0.\nData present on the SI pin will  be ignored whenever the device is deselected (CS  is deasserted).-Input/\nOutput\n\n 3 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022SO (I/O1)SERIAL OUTPUT:  The SO pin is used to shift dat a out from the device.

Pleas e refer \nto “Protection Commands and Features” on page 17  for more details on protection features and \nthe WP  pin.\nThe WP  pin is internally pulled-high and may be left floating if hard ware controlled protection will \nnot be used. However, it is recommended that the WP  pin also be externally connected to VCC \nwhenever possible.Low Input\nHOLDHOLD:  The HOLD  pin is used to temporarily pause serial communication without deselecting or \nresetting the device. While the HOLD  pin is asserted, transitions on the SCK pin and data on the \nSI pin will be ignored, and the SO pin will be in a high-impeda nce state.\nThe CS  pin must be asserted, and the SCK pin must be in the low state  in order for a Hold \ncondition to start. A Hold condition pauses serial communication only and does not have an \neffect on internally self-timed operations such as a program or  erase cycle. Please refer to \n“Hold” on page 35  for additional details on the Hold operation.The HOLD  pin is internally \npulled-high and may be left floating if the Hold function will not be used.

Memory Array\nTo provide the greatest flexibility, the memory array of the AT 25DF041B can be erased in three levels of granularity: \nsectors, blocks and pages. There is also a full chip erase. The size of the erase blocks is optimized for both code and \ndata storage applications, allowing both code and data segments  to reside in their own erase regions. The erase \noperations can be performed at the chip, sector, block, or page  level. \nProgram operations to the device can be done at the full page level or at th e byte level (a variable number of bytes, from \n1byte to 256 bytes per page).  The Memory Architecture Diagram illustrates the breakdown of each erase level.\nFigure 4-1.

Device Operation\nThe AT25DF041B is controlled by a set of instructions that are sent from a host controller, commonly referred to as the\nSPI Master. The SPI Master communicates with the AT25DF041B via  the SPI bus which is comprised of four signal lines:\nChip Select ( CS), Serial Clock (SCK), Serial Input (SI), and Serial Output (SO ).\nThe SPI protocol defines a total of four modes of operation (mo de 0, 1, 2, or 3) with each mode differing in respect to the\nSCK polarity and phase and how the polarity and phase control t he flow of data on the SPI bus. The AT25DF041B\nsupports the two most common modes, SPI Modes 0 and 3. The only  difference between SPI Modes 0 and 3 is the\npolarity of the SCK signal when in the inactive state (when the  SPI Master is in standby mode and not transferring any\ndata). With SPI Modes 0 and 3, data is always latched in on the  rising edge of SCK and always output on the falling edge\nof SCK.\nFigure 5-1. SPI Mode 0 and 3\n5.1 Dual Output Read\nThe AT25DF041B features a Dual-Output Read mode that allow two bits of data to be clocked out of the device every \nclock cycle to improve throughput. To accomplish this, both the SI and SO pins are utilized as outputs for the transfer of \ndata bytes. With the Dual-Output Read Array command, the SI pin becomes an output along with the SO pin. \n6. Commands and Addressing\nA valid instruction or operation must always be started by first asserting the CS pin. After the CS pin has been asserted,\nthe host controller must then clock out a valid 8-bit opcode on  the SPI bus. Following the opcode, instruction depende nt\ninformation such as address and data bytes would then be clocke d out by the host controller. All opcode, address, and\ndata bytes are transferred with the most-significant bit (MSB) first. An operation is ended by deasserting the CS pin.\nOpcodes not supported by the AT25DF041B will be ignored by the device and no operation will be started. The devicewill continue t \no ignore any data presented on the SI pin until the start of the next operation ( CS pin being deasserted and\nthen reass erted). In addition, if the CS pin is deasserted before complete opcode and address informati on is sent to the\ndevice, then no operation will be performed and the device will  simply return to the idle state and wait for the next\noperation.\nAddressing of the device requires a total of three bytes of inf ormation to be sent, representing addre ss bits A23-A0.\nSince the upper address limit of t he AT2 5DF041B memory array is  07FFFFh, address bits A23-A19 are always ignored\nby the device.SCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB LSB\nMSB LSB\n\n 7 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022Table 6-1.

Read Commands\n7.1 Read Array\nThe Read Array command can be used to sequentially read a conti nuous stream of data from the device by simply \nproviding the clock signal once the initial starting address is  specified. The device incorporates an internal address \ncounter that automatically increments every clock cycle.\nTwo opcodes (0Bh and 03h) can be used for the Read Array comman d. The use of each opcode depends on the \nmaximum clock frequency that will be u sed to read data from the  device. The 0Bh opcode can be used at \nany clock \nfrequency up to the maximum specified by fCLK, and the 03h opcode can be used for lower frequency read opera tions up \nto the maximum specified by fRDLF. \nTo perform the Read Array operation, the CS pin must first be asserted and the appropriate opcode (0Bh or 03h) must be \nclocked into the device. After the opcode has been clocked in, the three address bytes must be clocked in to specify the \nstarting address location of the first byte to read within the memory array. Following the three address bytes, an \nadditional dummy byte needs to be clocked into the device if th e 0Bh opcode is used for the Read Array operation. \nAfter the three address bytes (and the dummy byte if using opco de 0Bh) have been clocked in, additional clock cyc les \nwill result in data being output on the SO pin. The data is  always output with the MSB of\n a byte first. When the last byte \n(07FFFFh) of the memory array has been read, the device will continue reading back at the beginning of the array (000000h). No delays will be incurred when wrapping around from  the end of the array to the beginning of the array.\nDeasserting the \nCS pin will terminate the read operation and put the SO pin into high-impedance state. The CS pin can \nbe deasserted at any time and does not require a full byte of d ata be read.\nFigure 7-1.

Read Array - 0Bh Opcode\n7.2 Dual-Output Read Array\nThe Dual-Output Read Array command is similar to the standard R ead Array command and can be used to sequentially \nread a continuous stream of data from the device by simply providing the clock signal once the initial starting address has \nbeen specified. Unlike the standard Read Array command, however , the Dual-Output Read Array command allows two \nbits of data to be clocked out of the device on every clock cyc le, rather than just one.\nThe Dual-Output Read Array command can be used at any clock fre quency, up to the maximu m specified by fRDDO. To \nperform the Dual-Output Read Array operation, the CS pin must first be asserted and then the opcode 3Bh must be \nclocked into the device. After the opcode has been clocked in, the three address bytes must be clocked in to specify the \nlocation of the first byte to read within the memory array. Fol lowing the three address bytes, a single dummy byte must \nalso be clocked into the device.\nAfter the three address bytes and the dummy byte have been cloc ked in, additional clock  cycles will result in data being \noutput on bo th the SO and SI pins. The data is always output wi th the MSB of a byte f\nirst and the MSB is always output \non the SO pin. During the first clock cycle, bit seven of the first data byte is output on the SO pin, while bit six of the sa me \ndata byte is output on the SIO pin. During the next clock cycle, bits five and four of the first data byte are output on the SO \nand SIO pins, respectively. The sequence continues with each by te of data being output after every four clock cycles. \nWhen the last byte (07FFFFh) of the memory array has been read,  the device will continue reading from the beginning of \nthe array (000000h). No delays will be incurred when wrapping a round from the end of the array to the beginning of the \narray.Deasserting the CS pin will terminate the read operation and put the SO and SI pi ns into a high-impedance state. \nThe CS pin can be deasserted at any time and does not require that a full byte of data be read.\nFigure 7-3.

Program and Erase Commands\n8.1 Byte/Page Program\nThe Byte/Page Program command allo ws anywhere from a single byte of data to 256 bytes of data to be programmed \ninto previously erased memory locations. An erased memory locat ion is one that has all eight bits set to the logical “1” \nstate (a byte value of FFh). B efore a Byte/Page Program command  can be started, the Write Enable command must \nhave been previously issued to the device (see “Write Enable” on page 17 ) to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit of the \nStatus Register to a logical “1” state.\nTo perform a Byte/Page Program command, an opcode of 02h must b e cloc ked into  the devic e followed by the three \naddress bytes denoting the first byte location of the memory ar ray to begin programming at. After the address bytes have \nbeen clocked in, data can then be clocked into the device and will be stored in an internal buffer.\nIf the starting memory address denoted by A23-A0 does not fall on an even 256-byte pag e boundary (A7-A0 are not all \n0), then \nspecial circumstances regarding which memory locations to be programmed will apply. In this situation, any data \nthat is sent to the device that goes beyond the end of the page  will wrap around back to the beginning of the same page. \nFor example, if the starting address denoted by A23-A0 is 0000F Eh, and three bytes of data are sent to the device, then \nthe first two bytes of data will be programmed at addresses 000 0FEh and 0000FFh while the last byte of data will be \nprogrammed at address 000000h. The remaining bytes in the page (addresses 000001h through 0000FDh) will not be \nprogrammed and will remain in the erased state (FFh). In additi on, if more than 256 bytes of data are sent to the device, \nthen only the last 256 bytes sent will be latched into the internal buffer.When the \nCS pin is deasserted, the device will take the data stored in the  internal buffer and program it into the \nappropriate memory array locations based on the starting address specified by A23-A0 and the number of data bytes \nsent to the device. If less than 256 bytes of data were sent to the device, then the remaining bytes within the page will not \nbe programmed and will remain in the erased state (FFh). The pr ogramming of the data bytes is internally self-timed and \nshould take place in a time of tPP or tBP if only programming a single byte.\nThe three address bytes and at least one complete byte of data must b e clocked into the  device before the CS pin is \ndeasserted, and the CS pin must be deasserted on even byte boundaries (multiples of eight bits); otherwise, the device \nwill abort the operation and no data will be programmed into th e memory array. In addition, if the memory is in the \nprotected state (see “Protect Sector” on page 19 ), then the Byte/Page Program command will not be executed, and  the \ndevice will return to the idle state once the CS pin has been deasserted. The WEL bit in the Status Register will be reset \nback to the logical “0” state if the program cycle aborts due t o an incomplete address being sent, an incomplete byte of \ndata being sent, the CS pin being deasserted on uneven byte boundaries, or because the  memory location to be \nprogrammed is protected.\nWhile the device is programming, the Status Register can be rea d and will indicate that the device is busy. For faster \nthroughput, it i\ns recommended that the Status Register be polle d rather than waiting the tBP or tPP time to determine if the \ndata bytes have finished programming. For fastest throughput an d least power consumption, it is recommended that the \nActive Status Interrupt command 25h be used. After the initial 16 clks, no more clocks are required. Once the BUSY \ncycle is done, SO will be driven low immediately to signal the device has finished programming.At some point before the \nprogram cycle completes, the WEL bit in the Status Register will be reset back to the logical “0” state.\nThe device also incorporates an intelligent programming algorit hm that can detect when a byte location fails to program \nproperly. If a programming error arises, it will be indicated b y the EPE b i\nt in the Status Register.\n\n 1 1 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022Figure 8-1. Byte Program\nFigure 8-2. Page Program\n8.2 Dual-Input Byte/Page Program\nThe Dual-Input Byte/Page Program command is similar to the standard Byte/Page Program command and can be used \nto program anywhere from a single byte of data up to 256 bytes of data into previously erased memory locations. Unlike the standard Byte/Page Program com mand, however, the Dual-Input Byte/Page Program command allows two bits of \ndata to be clocked into the device on every clock cycle rather than just one.\nBefore the Dual-Input Byte/Page Program command can be started,  the Write Enable comman d must have been \npreviously issued to the device (see “Write Enable” on page 17 ) to set the Write  Enable Latch (WEL) bit of the Status \nRegister to a Logical 1 state. To perform a Dual-Input Byte/Pag e Program command, a n A2h opcode must be cloc ked \ninto \nthe device followed by the three address bytes denoting th e first location of the memory array to begin programming \nat. After the address bytes have been clocked in, data can then  be clocked into the device two bits at a time on both the \nSO and SI pins.The data is always input with the MSB of a byte first, and the MSB is always input on the SO pin. During the first clock \ncycle, bit seven \nof the first data byte is input on the SO pin while bit six of the same data byte is input on the SI pin. Dur ing \nthe next clock cycle, bits five and four of the first data byte are input on the SO and SI pins, respectively. The sequence \ncontinues with each byte of data being input after every four c lock cycles. Like the standard Byte/Page Program \ncommand, all data clocked into the device are stored in an inte rnal buffer.\nIf the starting memory address denoted by A23-A0 does not fall on an even 256-byte pag e boundary (A7-A0 are not all \n0), then specia\nl circumstances regarding which memory locations  are to be programmed will apply. In this situation, any \ndata that are sent to the device that go beyond the end of the page will wrap around to the beginning of the same page. \nIn addition, if more than 256 bytes of data is sent to the devi ce, then only the last 256 bytes sent will be latched into the \ninternal buffer.\nExample: If the starting  address denoted by A23-A0 is 0 000FEh and three bytes of data are sent to the device, then \nthe first two bytes of data will be programmed at addresses 000 0FEh and 0000FFh, while the last byte of SCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB MSB231 0\n0000001067541 011 981 2 39 37 38 33 36 35 34 31 32 29 30\nOPCODE\nHIGH-IMPEDANCEAAAA AAA AA\nMSBDDDDDDD DADDRESS BITS A23-A0 DATA IN\nSCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB MSB231 0\n0000001067549 83 9 37 38 33 36 35 34 31 32 29 30\nOPCODE\nHIGH-IMPEDANCEAA AAA A\nMSBDDDDDDD DADDRESS BITS A23-A0 DATA IN BYTE 1\nMSBDDDDDDD DDATA IN BYTE n\n\n 1 2 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022data will be programmed at address 000000h. The remaining bytes  in the page (addresses 000001h \nthrough 0000FDh) will not be programmed and will remain in the erased state (FFh). \nWhen the CS pin is deasserted, the device will program the data stored in the internal buffer into the appropriate memory \narray locations based on the starting address specified by A23- A0 and the number of data bytes sent to the device. If \nfewer than 256 bytes of data is sent to the device, then the re maining bytes within the page will not be programmed and \nwill remain in the erased state ( FFh). The programming of the data bytes is internally self-timed and should take place in \na time of tPP or tBP if only programming a page (tPP) or a single byte (tBP).\nThe three address bytes and at least one complete byte of data must b e clocked into the  device before the CS pin is \ndeasserted, and the CS pin must be deasserted on even byte boundaries (multiples of eight bits); otherwise, the device \nwill abort the operation and no data will be programmed into th e memory array. In addition, if the address specified by \nA23-A0 points to a memory location within a sector that is in the protected state (see “Protect Sector” on page 19), then \nthe Byte/Page Program command will not be executed and the devi ce will return to the idle state once the CS pin has \nbeen deasserted. The WEL bit in the Status Register will be reset back to the Logical 0 state if the program cycle aborts \ndue to an incomplete address being sent, an incomplete byte of data being sent, the CS pin being deasserted on uneven \nbyte boundaries, or because the memory location to be programmed is protected or locked down.\nWhile the device is programming, the Status Register can be rea d and will indicate that the device is busy.

Dual-Input Page Program\n8.3 Sequential Program Mode\nThe Sequential Program Mode improves throughput over the Byte/P age Program command when the Byte/Page \nProgram command is used to program single bytes only into conse cutive address locations. For example, some systems \nmay be designed to program only a single byte of information at  a time and cannot utilize a buffered Page Program \noperation due to design restrictions. In such a case, the system would normally have to perform multiple Byte Program \noperations in order to program data into sequential memory loca tions. This approach can add considerable system \noverhead and SPI bus traffic.\nThe Sequential Programming Mode helps reduce system overhead and bus traffic by in corporating an internal address \ncounter that keeps track of the byte location to program, there by eliminating the need to supply an address s\nequence to \nthe device for every byte to program. When using the Sequential  Program mode, all address locations to be programmed \nmust be in the erased state. Before the Sequential Program mode can first be entered, the Write Enable command must \nhave been previously issued to the device to set the WEL bit of  the Status Register to a logical “1” state.\nTo start the Sequential Program Mode, the CS pin must first be asserted, and either an opcode of ADh or AFh must be \nclocked into the device. For the first program cycle, three address bytes must be clocked in after the opcode to designate \nthe first byte location to program. After the address bytes have been clocked in, the byte of data to be programmed can \nbe sent to the device. Deasserting the CS pin will start the internally self-timed program operation, and the byte of data \nwill be programmed into the memory location specified by A23 - A0.\nAfter the first byte has been successfully programmed, a second  byte can be programmed by simply reasserting the CS \npin, clocking in the ADh or AFh opcode, and then clocking in the next byte of data. When the CS pin is deasserted, the \nsecond byte of data will be programmed into the next sequential memory location. The process would be repeated for \nany additional bytes. There is no need to reissue the Write Ena ble command once the Sequential Program Mode has \nbeen entered.\nWhen the last desired byte has been programmed into the memory array, the Sequential Program  Mode operation can \nbe terminated by r\neasserting the CS pin and sending the Write  Disable command to the device to reset the WEL bit in the \nStatus Register back to the logical  “0” state.\nIf more than one byte of \ndata is ever clocked in during each program cycle, then only the last byte of data sent on the SI \npin \nwill be stored in the internal latches. The programming of each byte is internally self-timed and should take place in a \ntime of tBP. For each program cycle, a complete byte of data must be clock ed into the device before the CS pin is \ndeasserted, and the CS pin must be deasserted on even byte boundaries (multiples of eight bits); otherwise, the device \nwill abort the operation, the byte of data will not be programm ed into the memory array, and the WEL bit in the Status \nRegister will be reset back to the logical “0” state.SCKCS\nSI (SIO)\nSO (SOI)MSB MSB231 0\n1010001067541 011 981 2 39 37 38 33 36 3534 31 32 29 30\nOpcode\nAAAA AAA AA\nMSB MSBD7D6\nD5D4\nD3D2\nD1D0\nD7D6\nD5D4\nD3D2\nD1D0Address Bits A23-A0Input\nData Byte 1\nMSBD7D6\nD5D4\nD3D2\nD1D0Input\nData Byte nInput\nData Byte 2\nHigh-impedance\n\n 1 4 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022If the address initially specified by A23 - A0 points to a memo ry location within a sector that is in the protected state, then \nthe Sequential Program Mode command will not be executed, and the device will return to the idle state once the CS pin \nhas been deasserted. The WEL bit in the Status Register will also be reset back to the logical “0” state.\nThere is no address wrapping when using the Sequential Program Mode. Therefore, w hen the last byte (07FFFFh) of the \nmemory array has been programmed, the device will automatically  exit the Sequential Program mode and reset the WEL \nbit in the Status Register back to the logical “0” state. In ad dition, the Sequential Program mode will not automatically skip  \nover protected sectors; therefore, once the highest unprotected  memory location in a programming sequence has been \nprogrammed, the device will automatically exit the Sequential Program mode and reset the WEL bit in the Status \nRegister. For example, if Sector 1 was protected and Sector 0 was currently being programmed, once the last byte of \nSector 0 was programmed, the Sequential Program mode would auto matically end. To continue programming with \nSector 2, the Sequential Program mode would have to be restarte d by supplying the ADh or AFh opcode, the three \naddress bytes, and the first byte of Sector 2 to program.\nWhile the device is programming a byte, the Status Register can be read and will indicate that the device is busy. For \nfaster th roughput, it is recommended that the Status Register b e polled at the end of each program cy c\nle rather than \nwaiting the tBP time to determine if the byte has finished programming before starting the next Sequential Program mode \ncycle.\nThe device also incorporates an intelligent programming algorit hm that can detect when a byte location fails to program \nproperly. If a programming error arises, it will be indicated b y the EPE b i\nt in the Status Register.\nFigure 8-5. Sequential Program Mode – Status Register Polling\nFigure 8-6.

The Main Memory \nByte/Page Program command can be ut ilized at a later time.\nTo p\nerform a Page Erase with the standard page size (256 bytes), an opcode  of 81h must be clocked into the device \nfollowed by three address bytes comprised of:\nByte 0: 81h the page eras\ne command code\nByte 1: XXXX X, PA10, PA9, PA8; which is five (5) dummy bits an d three (3) page a ddress bits\nBy\nte 2: PA<7:0>; which is eight (8) page address bits\nByte 3: XXXX XXXX; which is eight (8) dummy bits\nWhen a low-to-high transition occurs on the CS pin, the device will erase the selected page (the erased state  is a Logic \n1). The erase operation is internally self-timed and should take place in a maximum time of tPE. During this time, the \nRDY /BUSY  bit in the Status Register will indicate that the device is bus y.\nThe device also incorporates an intelligent erase algorithm tha t can detect when a byte location fails to erase properly. If \nan erase error arises, it will be indicated by the EPE bit in t he Status Register.\n8.5 Block Erase\nA block of 4, 32, or 64Kbytes can be erased (all bits set to th e logical “1” state) in a single operation by using one of thre e \ndifferent opcodes for the Block Erase command. An opcode of 20h is used for a 4-Kbyte erase, an opcode of 52h for a \n32-Kbyte erase, and an opcode of D8h is used for a 64-Kbyte erase. Before a Block Erase command can be started, theWrite Enable command must have been previously issued to the de vice to set the WEL bit of the Status Register to a\nlogical “1” state.\nTo perform a Block Erase, the \nCS pin must first be asserted and the appropriate opcode (20h, 52 h, or D8h) must be \nclocked into the device. After the opcode has been clocked in, the three address bytes specifying an address within the \n4-, 32-, or 64-Kbyte block to be erased must be clocked in. Any  additional data clocked into the device will be ignored. \nWhen the CS pin is deasserted, the device will erase the appropriate block . The erasing of the block is internally self-\ntimed and should take place in a time of tBLKE.\nSince the Block Erase command erases a region of bytes, the lower order addre s s bits do not need to be decoded by the \ndevice. Therefore, for a 4-Kbyte erase, address bits A11-A0 will be ignored by the device and their values can be either a \nlogical “1” or “0”. For a 32-Kbyte erase, address bits A14-A0 w ill be ignored by the device. For a 64-Kbyte erase, address \nbits A15-A0 will be ignored by the device. Despite the lower or der address bits not being decoded by the device, the \ncomplete three address bytes must still be clocked into the device before the CS pin is deasserted, and the CS pin must \nbe deasserted on an even byte boundary (multiples of eight bits); otherwise, the device will abort the operation and no \nerase operation will be performed.\nIf the memory is in the protected state, then the Block Erase c ommand will not be executed, and the device will return to \nthe idle state once the CS pin has been deasserted.\nThe WEL bit in the Status Register will be reset back to the lo gical “0” state if the erase cycle aborts due to an incomplete \naddress being sent, the CS pin being deasserted on uneven byte boundaries, or because a m emory location within the \nregion to be erased is protected.While the device is executing a successful erase cycle, the Sta tus Register can be read  and will indicate that the device \nis busy. For faster throughput, it is recommended t\nhat the Stat us Register be polled rather than waiting the tBLKE time to \ndetermine if the device has finished erasing. At some point bef ore the erase cycle completes, the WEL bit in the Status \nRegister will be reset back to the logical “0” state.For fastest throughput and least power consumption, it is recom mended that the Active \n Status Interrupt command 25h be \nused. After the initial 16 clks, no more clocks are required.  Once the BUSY cycle is done, SO will be driven low \nimmediately to signal the device has finished erasing.\n\n 1 6 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022The device also incorporates an intelligent erase algorithm tha t can detect when a byte location fails to erase properly. If \nan erase error occurs, it will be indicated by the EPE bit in t he Status Register.\nFigure 8-7. Block Erase\n8.6 Chip Erase\nThe entire memory array can be erased in a single operation by using the Chip Erase command. Before a Chip Erase \ncommand can be started, the Write Enable command must have been  previously issued to the device to set the WEL bit \nof the Status Register to a logical “1” state.\nTwo opcodes (60h and C7h) can be used for the Chip Erase comman d. There is no difference in device functionality \nwhen utilizing the two opcodes, so they can be used interchange ably. To perform a Chip Erase , one of the two opcodes \nmust \nbe clocked into the device. Since the entire memory array is to be erased, no address bytes need to be clocked into \nthe device, and any data clocked in after the opcode will be ig nored. When the CS pin is deasserted, the device will erase \nthe entire memory array. The erasing of the device is internally self-timed and should take place in a time of tCHPE.\nThe complete opcode must be clocked into the device before the CS pin is deasserted, and the CS pin must be \ndeasserted on an even byte boundary (multiples of eight bits); otherwise, no erase will be performed. In addition, if any \nsector in the memory array is in the protected state, then the Chip Erase command will not be executed, and the device \nwill return to the idle state once the CS pin has been deasserted. The WEL bit in the Status Register will be reset back to \nthe logical “0” state if the CS pin is deasserted on uneven byte boundaries or if the memory i s in the protected state.\nWhile the device is executing a successful erase cycle, the Sta tus Register can be read and will indicate that the device \nis busy. For faster throughput, it is  recommended t\nhat the Stat us Register be polled rather than waiting the tCHPE time to \ndetermine if the device has finished erasing. At some point bef ore the erase cycle completes, the WEL bit in the Status \nRegister will be reset back to the logical “0” state.The device also incorporates an intelligent erase algorithm tha t can detect when \n a byte location fails to erase properly. If \nan erase error occurs, it will be indicated by the EPE bit in t he Status Register.\nFigure 8-8.

Protection Commands and Features\n9.1 Write Enable\nThe Write Enable command is used to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register to a logical “1” state. \nThe WEL bit must be set before a Byte/Page Program, Erase, Program OTP Security Register, or Write Status Register \ncommand can be executed. This makes the issuance of these comma nds a two step process, thereby reducing the \nchances of a command being accidentally or erroneously executed.

To issue the Protect Sector command, the CS pin must first be \nasserted and the opcode of 36h must be clocked into the device followed by three address bytes designating any address within the sector to be protected. Any additional data clocked into the device will be ignored. When the \nCS pin is \ndeasserted, the Sector Protection Register corresponding to the physical sector addressed by A23  - A0 will be set to the \nlogical “1” state , and the sector itself will\n then be protected  from program  and erase operations.

Unprotect Sector\n9.5 Global Protect/Unprotect\nThe Global Protect and Global Unprotect features can work in co njunction with the Protect Sector and Unprotect Sector \nfunctions. For example, a system can globally protect the entir e memory array and then use the Unprotect Sector \ncommand to individually unprotect certain sectors and individua lly reprotect them later by using the Protect Sector \ncommand. Likewise, a system can globally unprotect the entire m emory array and then individually protect certain \nsectors as needed.SCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB MSB231 0\n0011011067541 011 981 2 31 29 30 27 28 26\nOPCODE\nAAAA AAA AA AAAADDRESS BITS A23-A0\nHIGH-IMPEDANCE\nSCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB MSB231 0\n0011100167541 011 981 2 31 29 30 27 28 26\nOPCODE\nAAAA AAA AA AAAADDRESS BITS A23-A0\nHIGH-IMPEDANCE\n\n 2 0 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022Performing a Global Protect or Global Unprotect is accomplished  by writing a certain combination of data to the Status \nRegister using the Write Status Register command (see “Write St atus Register” section on page 31 for command \nexecution details). The Write Status Register command is also used to modify the SPRL (Sector Protection Registers \nLocked) bit to control hardware and software locking.\nTo perform a Global Protect, the appropriate WP pin and SPRL conditions must be met, and the system must write a \nlogical “1” to bits 5, 4, 3, and 2 of the Status Register. Conv ersely, to perform a Global Unprotect, the same WP and \nSPRL conditions must be met but the system must write a logical “0” to bits 5, 4, 3, and 2 of the Status Register.

All sectors currently protected \nwill remain protected, and all sectors currently unprotected wi ll remain \nunprotected.\nThe Sector Protection Registers are soft-locked and cannot be changed \nwhen the current state of SPRL is 1. Therefore, a Global Protect/Unprotect will not occur. However, the SPRL bit can be changed \nback to a 0 from a 1 since the WP\n pin is HIGH.

Likewise, the system can write an F0h to change the SPRL bit from a logical “0” to a logical “1” without \naffecting the current sector protection status (no changes will  be made to the Sector Protection Registers).\nWhen writing to the Status Register, bits 5, 4, 3, and 2 will not actually be modified but will be decoded by the device for \nthe purposes of the Global Protect and Global Unprotect functions. Only bit 7, the SPRL bit, will actually be modified. \nTher\nefore, when reading the Status Register, bits 5, 4, 3, and 2 will not reflect the values written to them but will instead \nindicate the status of the WP pin and the sector protection status. Please refer to the “Rea d Status Register” section and \nTable 11-1 on page 25  for details on the Status Register format and what values can be read for bits 5, 4, 3, and 2.\n9.6 Read Sector Protection Registers\nThe Sector Protection Registers can be read to determine the cu rrent software protection status of each sector. Reading \nthe Sector Protection Registers, however, will not determine th e status of the WP pin.\nTo read the Sector Protection Register for a particular sector,  the CS pin must first be asserted and the opcode of 3Ch \nmust be clocked in. Once the opcode has been clocked in, three address bytes designating any address within the sector \nmust be clocked in. After the last address byte has been clocke d in, the device will begin outputting data on the SO pin \nduring every subsequent clock cycle. The data being output will  be a repeating byte of either FFh or 00h to denote the \nvalue of the appropriate Sector Protection Register.\nDeasserting the CS pin will terminate the read operation and put the SO pin into a high-impedance state. The CS pin can \nbe deasserted at any time and does not require that a full byte  of data be read.\nIn addition to reading the individual Sector Protection Registe rs, the Software Protection Status (SWP) bit in the Status \nRegister can be \nread to determine if all, some, or none of the sectors are software protected (refer to the “Status Register \nCommands” on page 28  for more details).\nFigure 9-5.

For hardware locking to be active, two conditions must be met \n– the WP pin must be asserted and the SPRL bit must be in the logical “ 1” state.\nWhen hardware locking is active, the Sector Protection Register s are locked and the SPRL bit itself is also locked. \nTher\nefore, sectors that are protected will be locked in the pro tected state, and sectors that are unprotected will be locked \nin the unprotected state. These states cannot be changed as long as hardware locking is active, so the Protect Sector, Unprotect Sector, and Write Status Register commands will be ig nored. In order to modify the protection status of a \nsector, the \nWP pin must first be deasserted, and the SPRL bit in the Status R egister must be reset back to the logical “0” \nstate using the Write Status Register command.  When resetting the SPRL bit back to a logical “0”, it is not possible to \nperform a Global Protect or Global Unprotect at the same time s ince the Sector Protection Registers remain soft-locked \nuntil after the Write Status Register command has been executed .\nIf the WP pin is permanently connected to GND, then once the SPRL bit is set to a logical “1”, the only way to reset the bit \nback to the logical “0” state is to power-cycle or reset the device. This allows a system to power-up with all sectors software protected but not hardware locked. Therefore, sectors can be unprotected and protected as needed and then hardware locked at a later time by simply setting the SPRL bit in the Status Register.\nWhen the \nWP pin is deasserted, or if the WP pin is permanently connected to VCC, the SPRL bit in the Status Register \ncan still be set to a logical “1” to lock the Sector Protection  Registers. This provides a so ftware locking ability to prevent  \nerroneous Protect Sector or Unprotect Sector commands from being processed. When changing the SPRL bit to a \nlogical “1” from a logical “0”, it is also possible to perform a Global Protect or Global Unprotect at the same time by writing \nthe appropriate values into bits 5, 4, 3, and 2 of the Status Register.\nTables 9-4 and  9-5 detail the various protection and locking states of the device . \n.\nTable 9-4.

Security Commands\n10.1 Program OTP Security Register\nThe device contains a specialized OTP (One-Time Programmable) S ecurity Register that can be used for purposes such \nas unique device serialization, system-level Electronic Serial Number (ESN) storage, locked key storage, etc. The OTP \nSecurity Register is independent of the main Flash memory array  and is comprised of a total of 128 bytes of memory \ndivided into two portions. The first 64 bytes (byte locations 0 through 63) of the OTP Security Register are allocated as a \none-time user-programmable space. Once these 64 bytes have been  programmed, they cannot be erased or \nreprogrammed. The remaining 64 bytes of the OTP Security Register (byte locations 64 through 127) are factory programmed by Adesto and will contain a unique value for each device. The factory programmed data is fixed and cannot be changed\n.\nThe user-programmable portion of the OTP Security Register does  not need to be erased before it is prog rammed. In \naddition, the \nProgram OTP Security Register command operates on  the entire 64-byte user-programmable portion of the \nOTP Security Register at one time. Once the user-programmable s pace has been programmed with any number of \nbytes, the user-programmable space cannot be programmed again; therefore, it is not possible to only program the first \ntwo bytes of the register and then program the remaining 62 bytes at a later time.\nBefore the Program OTP Security Register command can be issued,  the Write Ena ble command must have bee n \npreviously issued to set the WEL bit in the Status Register to a logical “1”. To program the OTP Security Register, the CS \npin must first be asserted and an opcode of 9Bh must be clocked into the device followed by the three address bytes \ndenoting the first byte location  of the OTP Security Register to begin programming at. Since the  size of the user-\nprogrammable portion of \nthe OTP Security Register is 64 bytes, the upper order address bits do not need to be decoded \nby the device. Therefore, address bits A23-A6 will be ignored b y the device and their values can be either a logical “1” or \n“0”. After the address bytes have been clocked in, data can the n be clocked into the device and will be stored in the \ninternal buffer.\nIf the starting memory address denoted by A23-A0 does not start  at the beginning of the OTP Security Register memory \nspace (A5-A0 are not all 0), then special circumstances regardi ng which OTP Security Register locations to be \nprogrammed will apply. In this situation, any data that is sent to the device that goes beyond the end of the 64-byte user-\nprogrammable space will wrap around back to the beginning of th e OTP Security Register. For example, if the starting \naddress denoted by A23-A0 is 00003Eh, and three bytes of data are sent to the device, then the first two bytes of data \nwill be programmed at OTP Secur ity Register addresses 00003Eh a nd 00003Fh while the last byte of data will be \nprogrammed at address 000000h. The remaining bytes in the OTP Security Register (addresses 000001h through \n00003Dh) will not be programmed and will remain in the erased state (FFh). In addition, if more than 64 bytes of data are \nsent to the device, then only the last 64 bytes sent will be latched into the internal buffer.\nWhen the CS pin is deasserted, the device will take the data stored in the  internal buffer and program it into the \nappropriate OTP Security Register locations based on the starti ng address specified by A23-A0 and the number of data \nbytes sent to the device. If less than 64 bytes of data were se nt to the device, then the remaining bytes within the OTP \nSecurity Register will not be programmed and will remain in the  erased state (FFh). The programming of the data bytes is \ninternally self-timed and should take place in a time of tOTPP.Table 10-1. OTP Security Register\nSecurity Register\nByte Number\n0 1 . . . 62 63 64 65 . . . 126 127\nOne-Time User Programmable Factory Programmed by Adesto\n\n 2 4 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022The three address bytes and at least one complete byte of data must be clocked into the device before the CS pin is \ndeasserted, and the CS pin must be deasserted on even byte boundaries (multiples of eight bits); otherwise, the device \nwill abort the operation and the user-programmable portion of t he OTP Security Register will not be programmed. The \nWEL bit in the Status Register will be reset back to the logical “0” state if the OTP Security Register program cycle aborts \ndue to an incomplete address being sent, an incomplete byte of data being sent, the CS pin being deasserted on uneven \nbyte boundaries, or because the us er-programmable portion of th e OTP Security Register was previously programmed.\nWhile the device is programming the OTP Security Register, the Status Register can be read and will indicate that t he \ndevice is busy. For faster throughput, it is recommended that t\nhe Status Register be polled rather than waiting the tOTPP \ntime to determine if the data bytes have finished programming. At some point before the OTP Security Register \nprogramming completes, the WEL bit in the Status Register will be reset back to the logical “0” state.\nIf the device is powered-down during the OTP Security Register program cyc le, then the contents of the 64-b y te user \nprogrammable portion of the OTP Security Register cannot be gua ranteed and cannot be programmed again.\nThe Program OTP Security Register command utilizes the internal  256-buffer for processing. Therefore, the contents of \nthe buffer will be altered from its previou s state when t\nhis co mmand is issued.\nFigure 10-1. Program OT P Security Register\n10.2 Read OTP Secu rity Register\nThe OTP Security Register can be sequentially read in a similar  fashion to the Read Array operation up to the maximum \nclock frequency specified by fCLK. To read the OTP Security Register, the CS pin must first be asserted and the opcode \nof 77h must be clocked into the device. After the opcode has be en clocked in, the three address bytes must be clocked in \nto specify the starting address location of the first byte to r ead within the OTP Security Register. Following the three \naddress bytes, two dummy bytes must be clocked into the device before data can be output.\nAfter the three address bytes and the dummy bytes have been clo cked in, additional cl ock cycles wil l result in OTP \nSecurity Register data being output on the SO pin. When the last byte (00007Fh) of the OTP Security Register has been read, the device will continue reading back at the beginning of  the register (000000h). No delays will be incurred when \nwrapping around from the end of the register to the beginning o f the register.\nDeasserting the \nCS pin will terminate the read operation and put the SO pin into a high-impedance state. The CS pin can \nbe deasserted at any time and does not require that a full byte  of data be read.SCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB MSB231 0\n1001101167549 83 9 37 38 33 36 35 34 31 32 29 30\nOPCODE\nHIGH-IMPEDANCEAA AAA A\nMSBDDDDDDD DADDRESS BITS A23-A0 DATA IN BYTE 1\nMSBDDDDDDD DDATA IN BYTE n\n\n 2 5 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022Figure 10-2.

After the last bit (bit 0) of Status Re gister Byte 2 has been clocked out, the sequence will repeat \nitself, starting again with bit 7 of Status Register Byte 1, as  long as the CS pin remains asserted and the clock pin is being \npulsed. The data in the Status Register is constantly being updated, so each repeating sequence will output new data.\nDeasserting the CS pin will terminate the Read Status Register operation and put the SO pin into a high-impedance \nstate.

When the SPRL bit is in \nthe logical “1” state, all Sector Protection Registers are lock ed and cannot be modified with the Protect Sector and \nUnprotect Sector commands (the device will ignore these command s). In addition, the Global Protect and Global \nUnprotect features cannot be performed. Any sectors that are pr esently protected will remain protected, and any sectors \nthat are presently unprotected will remain unprotected.\nWhen the SPRL bit is in the logical “0” state, all Sector Prote ction Regis ters are unlocked and can be modified (the \nProtect Sector and Unprotect Sector commands, as well as the Gl\nobal Protect and Global Unprotect features, will be \nprocessed as normal). The SPRL bit defaults to the logical “0” state after a power-up or a device reset.\nThe SPRL bit can be modified freely whenever the WP pin is deasserted. However, if the WP pin is asserted, then the \nSPRL bit may only be changed from a logical “0” (Sector Protection Registers are unlocked) to a logical “1” (Sector \nProtection Registers are locked). In order to reset the SPRL bit back to a logical “0” using the Write Status Register command, the \nWP pin will have to first be deasserted.The SPRL bit is the only bit of the Status Register that can be user \nmodified via the Write Status Register command.\n11.1.2 SPM Bit\nThe SPM bit indicates whether the device is in the Byte/Page Pr ogram mode or the Sequential Program Mode. The \ndefault state after power-up or device reset is the Byte/Page Program mode.\n11.1.3 EPE Bit\nThe EPE bit indicates whether the last erase or program operati on completed successfully or not. If at least one byte \nduring the erase or program operation did not erase or program properly, then the EPE bit will be set to the logical “1” state. The EPE bit will not be set if an erase or program opera tion aborts for any reason such as an attempt to erase or \nprogram a protected region or if the WEL bit is not set prior t o an erase or program operation. The EPE bit will be updated \nafter every erase and program operation.3:2 SWP Software Protection Status R00All sectors are software  unprotected (all Sector \nProtection Registers are 0).\n01Some sectors are software protected.

There are three possible combinations \nof the SWP bits that indicate whether none, some, or all of the  sectors have been protected using the Protect Sector \ncommand or the Global Protect feature. If the SWP bits indicate  that some of the sectors have been protected, then the \nindividual Sector Protection Registers can be read with the Rea d Sector Protection Registers command to determine \nwhich sectors are in fact protected.\n11.1.6 WEL Bit\nThe WEL bit indicates the current status of the internal Write Enable Latch. When the WEL bit is in the logical “0” state, \nthe device will not accept any program, erase, Protect Sector, Unprotect Sector, or Write Status Register commands. \nThe WEL bit defaults to the logical “0” state after a device power-up or reset. In addition, the WEL bit will be reset to the \nlogical “0” state automatically under the following conditions:\n\uf06c Write Disable operation completes successfully\n\uf06c Write Status Register operation completes successfully or abort s\n\uf06c Protect Sector operation completes successfully or aborts\n\uf06c Unprotect Sector operation completes successfully or aborts\n\uf06c Byte/Page Program operation completes successfully or aborts\n\uf06c Sequential Program Mode reaches highest unprotected memory loca tion\n\uf06c Sequential Program Mode reaches the end of the memory array\n\uf06c Sequential Program Mode aborts (1)\n\uf06c Block Erase operation completes successfully or aborts\n\uf06c Chip Erase operation completes successfully or aborts\n\uf06c Hold condition aborts\nIf the WEL bit is in the logical “1” state, it will not be reset to a logical “0” if an operation aborts  due to an incomplete or \nunrecognized opcode being clocked into the device before the CS pin is deasserted. In order for the WEL bit to be reset \nwhen an operation aborts prematurely, the entire opcode for a program, erase, Protect Sector, Unprotect Sector, or Write Status Register command must have been clocked into the device.\n11.1.7 RDY /BSY Bit\nThe RDY /BSY bit is used to determine whether or not an internal operat ion, such as a program or erase, is in progress. \nTo poll the RDY /BSY bit to detect the completion of a program or erase cycle, new Status Register data must be \ncontinually clocked out of the device until the state of the RDY /BSY bit changes from a logical “1” to a logical “0”.Note that \nthe RDY /BSY bit can be read either from S tatus Register Byte 1 or from Status Register Byte 2. See also the Active \nStatus Interrupt command. (11.2)\n1. WEL bit will not be reset if Sof tware Reset co mmand is entere d.\n\n 2 8 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022Figure 11-1. Read Status Register\n11.1.8 RSTE Bit \nThe RSTE bit is used to enable or disable the Reset command. Wh en the RSTE bit is in the Logical 0 state (the default \nstate after power-up), the Reset command is disabled and any at tempts to reset the device using the Reset command \nwill be ignored. When the RSTE bit is in the Logical 1 state, t he Reset command is enabled.\nThe RSTE bit will retain its sta te as long as power is  applied to the device. Onc e set to the Logical 1 state, the RSTE bit \nwill remain in that state until it is modified using the Write Status Register Byte 2 command or until the device has been \npower cycled. The Reset command itself will not change the stat e of the RSTE bit.\nNote: 1. Only bit 4 of Status Register Byte 2 will be modified wh en using the Write S t atus Register Byte 2 command\n2. R/W = Readable and Writeable\nR = Readable only.\n11.2 Active Status Interrupt \nTo simplify the readout of the RDY /BSY bit, the Active Status Inte rrupt command (25h) may be used. It is then not \nnecessary to continuously read the status register, it is sufficient to monitor the value of the SO line. If the SO line is connected to an interrupt line on the host controller, the host controller may be in sleep mode until the SO line indicates \nthat the AT25DF041B is ready for the next command. \nThe \nRDY /BSY bit can be read at any time, including during an internally self-timed program or erase operation.

For SPI Mode3, at least one dummy bit has to be clocked into the device after the last bit of the \nopcode has been clocked in. (In most cases, this is most easily  done by sending a dummy byte to the device.) The value \nof the SI line after the opcode is clocked in is of no signific ance to the operation. For SPI Mode 0, this dummy bit (dummy \nbyte) is not required.\nThe value of RDY /BSY is then output on the SO line, and is continuously updated by the device for as long as the CS pin \nremains asserted. Additional clocks on the SCK pin are not requ ired. If the RDY /BSY bit changes from 1 to 0 while the \nCS pin is asserted, the SO line will change from 1 to 0. (The  RDY /BSY bit cannot change from 0 to 1 during an operation, \nso if the SO line already is 0, it will not change.) Deasserting the \nCS pin will terminate the Active Status Interrupt operation and put the SO pin into a high-impedance \nstate. The CS pin can be deasserted at any time and does not require that a full byte of data be read.\nFigure 11-2. Active  Status Interrupt\n11.3 Write Status Register\nThe Write Status Register command is used to modify the SPRL bit of the Status Register and/or to perform a Global \nProtect or Global Unprotect operation. Before the Write Status Register command can be issued, the Write Enable \ncommand must have been previously issued to set the WEL bit in the Status Register to a logical “1”.\nTo issue the Write Status Register command, the CS pin must first be asserted and the opcode of 01h must be clock ed \ninto the device followed by one byte of data. The one byte of d ata consists of the SPRL bit value, a don’t care bit, four \ndata bits to denote whether a Global Protect or Unprotect should be performed, and two additional don’t care bits (see \nTable 11-3 ). Any additional data bytes that are sent to the device will be ignored. When the CS pin is deasserted, the \nSPRL bit in the Status Register will be modified, and the WEL b it in the Status Register will be reset back to a logical “0”. \nThe values of bits 5, 4, 3, and 2 and the state of the SPRL bit  before the Write Status Register command was executed \n(the prior state of the SPRL bit) will determine whether or not  a Global Protect or Global Unprotect will be perfomed. \nPlease refer to the “Global Protect/Unprotect” section on page 21 for more details.\nThe complete one byte of data must be clocked into the device b efore the CS pin is deasserted; otherwise, the device will \nabort the operation, the state of the SPRL bit will not change, no potential Global Protect or Unprotect will be performed, and the WEL bit in the Status Register will be reset back to the logical “0” state.\nIf the \nWP pin is asserted, then the SPRL bit can only be set to a logical “1”. If an attempt is made to reset the SPRL bit to \na logical “0” while the WP pin is asserted, then the Write Status Register command will be ignored, and the WEL bit in the SCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB231 0\n00\x14 0010167541 011 981 21 5 1314\nH IGH- IMPE D A N CE5\'<\x12%6<H IGH- IMPE D A N CE23&2\'(\n\n 3 0 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022Status Register will be reset back to the logical “0” state. In  order to reset the SPRL bit to a logical “0”, the WP pin must \nbe deasserted.\nFigure 11-3. Write Status Register\n11.4 Write Status Register Byte 2\nThe Write Status Register Byte 2 command is used to modify the RSTE. Using the Write Status Register Byte 2 \ncommand is the only way to modify the RSTE in the Status Regist er during normal device operation. Before the Write \nStatus Register Byte 2 command can be issued, the Write Enable command must have been previously issued to set the WEL bit in the Status Register to a Logical 1.\nTo issue the Write Status Register Byte 2 command, the \nCS pin must first be asserted and then the opcode 31h must be \nclocked into the device followed by one byte of data. The one b yte of data consists of three don’t-care bits, the RSTE bit \nvalue, and four additional don’t-care bits (see Table 11-4). Any additional data bytes sent to the device will be ignored. \nWhen the CS pin is deasserted, the RSTE bit in the Status Register will be modified, and the WEL bit in the Status \nRegister will be reset back to a Logical 0.The complete one byte of data must be clocked into the device b efore the \nCS pin is deasserted, and the CS pin must be \ndeasserted on even byte boundaries (multiples of eight bits); o therwise, the device will abort the operation, the state of \nthe RSTE bit will not change, and the WEL bit in the Status Reg ister will be reset back to the Logical 0 state.Table 11-3.

Other Commands and Functions\n12.1 Read Manufacturer and Device ID\nIdentification information can be read from the device to enabl e systems to electronically query and identify the device \nwhile it is in system. The identification method and the command opcode comply with the JEDEC standard for \n“Manufacturer and Device ID Read Methodology for SPI Compatible  Serial Interface Memory Devices”. The type of \ninformation that can be read from the device includes the JEDEC  defined Manufacturer ID, the vendor specific Device ID, \nand the vendor specific Extended Device Information.\nSince not all Flash devices are capable of operating at very high clock frequencies, applications should be designed to \nread the identification \ninformation from the devices at a reasonably low clock frequency to ensure all devices used in the \napplication can be identified properly. Once the identification process is complete, the application can increase the clock \nfrequency to accommodate specific Flash devices that are capabl e of operating at the higher clock frequencies.\nTo read the identification information, the CS pin must first be asserted and the opcode of 9Fh must be clocked into the \ndevice. After the opcode has been clocked in, the device will begin outputting the identification data on the SO pin during \nthe subsequent clock cycles. The first byte that will be output  will be the Manufacturer ID followed by two bytes of Device \nID information. The fourth byte output will be the Extended Dev ice Information String Length, which will be 00h indicating \nthat no Extended Device Information follows. After the Extended  Device Information String Length byte is output, the SO \npin will go into a high-impedance state; therefore, additional clock cycles will have no affect on the SO pin and no data \nwill be output. As indicated in the JEDEC standard, reading the  Extended Device Information String Length and any \nsubsequent data is optional.Deasserting the CS pin will terminate the Manufacturer and Device ID read operati on and \nput the SO pin into a high-impedance state. The CS pin can be deasserted at any time and does not require that a full \nbyte of data be read.SCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB231 0\n0011000675 4\nOpcode10 11981 415 13 12\n1\nMSBXXXDXXX XStatus Register In\nByte 2\nHigh-impedance\nTable 12-1.

Read Manufacturer and Device ID\n12.2 Deep Power-Down\nDuring normal operation, the device will be placed in the stand by mode to consume less power as long as the CS pin \nremains deasserted and no internal operation is in progress. Th e Deep Power-Down command offers the ability to place \nthe device into an even lower power consumption state called th e Deep Power-Down mode.\nWhen the device is in the Deep Power-Down mode, all commands in cluding the Read Status Reg ister command will be \nignored with the exception of the Resume from Deep Power-Down c\nommand. Since all commands will be ignored, the \nmode can be used as an extra protection mechanism against program and erase operations.\nEntering the Deep Power-Down mode is accomplished by simply ass erting the CS pin, clocking in the opcode of B9h, \nand then deasserting the CS pin. Any additional data clocked into the device after the opc ode will be ignored. When the \nCS pin is deasserted, the device will enter the Deep Power-Down m ode within the maximum time of tEDPD.\nThe complete opcode must be clocked in before the CS pin is deasserted, and the CS pin must be deasserted on an \neven byte boundary (multiples of eight bits); otherwise, the de vice will abort the operation and return to the standby mode \nonce the CS pin is deasserted. In addition, the device will default to the  standby mode after a power-cycle.\nThe Deep Power-Down command will be ignored if an internally se lf-timed operation suc h as a program or erase cycle is \nin progress. The Deep Power-Down command must be reissued after  the internally self-timed operation has been \ncompleted in order for the device to enter the Deep Power-Down mode.Table 12-2.

Deep Power-Down\n12.3 Resume from Deep Power-Down\nIn order to exit the Deep Power-Down mode and resume normal dev ice operation, the Resume from Deep Power-Down \ncommand must be issued. The Resume from Deep Power-Down command  is the only command that the device will \nrecognized while in the Deep Power-Down mode.\nTo resume from the Deep Power-Down mode, the CS pin must first be asserted and opcode of ABh must be clocked into \nthe device. Any additional data clocked into the device after the opcode will be ignored. When the CS pin is deasserted, \nthe device will exit the Deep Power-Down mode within the maximu m time of tRDPD and return to the standby mode. After \nthe device has returned to the standby mode, normal command ope rations such as Read Array can be resumed.\nIf the complete opcode is not clocked in before the CS pin is deasserted, or if the CS pin is not deasserted on an even \nbyte boundary (multiples of eight bits), then the device will abort the operation and return to the Deep Power-Down \nmode.\nFigure 12-3.

When the device is in the Ultra-\nDeep Power-Down mode, all commands including the Status Registe r Read and Resume from Deep Power-Down  \ncomma\nnds will be ignored. Since all commands will be ignored, t he mode can be used as an extra protection mechanism \nagainst inadvertent or unintentional program and erase operatio ns. Entering the Ultra-Deep Power-Down mode is \naccomplished by simply asserting the CS pin, clocking in the opcode 79h, and then deasserting the CS pin. Any \nadditional data clocked into the device after the opcode will b e ignored. When the CS pin is deasserted, the device will \nenter the Ultra-Deep Power-Down mode within the maximum time of  tEUDPD\nThe complete opcode must be clocked in before the CS pin is deasserted; otherwise, the device will abort the operat ion \nand return to the standby mode once the CS pin is deasserted. In addition, the device will default to the  standby mode \nafter a power cycle. The Ultra-Deep Power-Down command will be ignored if an internally self-timed operation such as a \nprogram or erase cycle is in progress.  \nFigure 12-4. Ultra- Deep Power-Down\n12.5 Exit Ultra-Deep Power-Down\nTo exit from the Ultra-Deep Power-Down mode, any one of three operations can be performed:\nChip Select Toggle\nThe CS pin must simply be pulsed by asserting the CS pin, waiting the minimum necessary tCSLU  time, and then \ndeasserting the CS pin again.   To facilitate simple software development, a dummy byte opcode can also be entered \nwhile the CS pin is being pulsed; the dummy byte opcode is simply ignored b y the device in this case. After the CS pin \nhas been deasserted, the device will exit from the Ultra-Deep P ower-Down mode and return to the standby mode within \na maximum time of tXUDPD     If the CS pin is reasserted before the tXUDPD time has elapsed in an attempt to start a new \noperation, then that operation will be ignored and nothing will  be performed.SCKCS\nSI\nSOMSB\nICC231 0\n0675 4\nOpcode\nHigh-impedance\nUltra-Deep Power-Down Mode CurrentActive Current\nStandby Mode CurrenttEUDPD\n1111001\n\n 3 5 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022Figure 12-5.

Exit Ultra-Deep Power-Down (Chip Select Low)\nPower Cycling\nThe device can also exit the Ultra Deep Power Mode by power cyc ling the device. The system must wait for the device to \nreturn to the standby mode before normal command operations can  be resumed. Upon recovery from Ultra Deep Power \nDown all internal registers will be at there Power-On default s tate.\n12.6 Hold\nThe HOLD  pin is used to pause the serial communication with the device without having to stop or reset the clock \nsequence. The Hold mode, however, does not have an affect on an y internally self-timed operations such as a program \nor erase cycle. Therefore, if an erase cycle is in progress, as serting the HOLD  pin will not pause the operation, and the \nerase cycle will continue until it is finished.The Hold mode can only be entered while the \nCS pin is asserted. The Hold mode is activated simply by assertin g the \nHOLD  pin during the SCK low pulse. If the HOLD  pin is asserted during the SCK high pulse, then the Hold mode won’t be \nstarted until the beginning of the next SCK low pulse. The device will remain in the Hold mode as long as the HOLD  pin \nand CS pin are asserted.\nWhile in the Hold mode, the SO pin will be in a high-impedance state. In addition , both the SI pin and the SCK pin will be \nignored. The WP pin, however, can still be asserted or deasserted while in the Hold mode.CS\nSO\nICCHigh-impedance\nUltra-Deep Power-Down Mode CurrentActive Current\nStandby Mode CurrenttXUDPDtCSLU\nCS\nSO\nICCHigh-impedance\nUltra-Deep Power-Down Mode CurrentActive CurrenttXUDPD\n\n 3 6 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022To end the Hold mode and resume serial communication, the HOLD  pin must be deasserted during the SCK low pulse. If \nthe HOLD  pin is deasserted during the SCK high pulse, then the Hold mod e won’t end until the beginning of the next SCK \nlow pulse.\nIf the CS pin is deasserted while the HOLD  pin is still asserted, then any operation that may have been started will be \naborted, and the device will reset the WEL bit in the Status Re gister back to the logical “0” state.\nFigure 12-7. Hold Mode\n12.7 Reset\nIn some applications, it may be necessary to prematurely termin ate a program or erase operation rather than wait the \nhundreds of microseconds or milliseconds necessary for the prog ram or erase operation to complete normally. The \nReset command allows a program or erase operation in progress to be ended abruptly and returns the device to an idle \nstate. Since the need to reset the device is immediate, the Wri te Enable command does not need to be issued prior to the \nReset command. Therefore, the Reset command operates independen tly of the state of the WEL bit in the Status \nRegister.\nThe Reset command can be executed only if the command has been enabled by setting the Reset Enabled (RSTE) bit in \nthe Status Register to a Logical 1 using write status register byte 2 command 31h. This command should be entered \nbefore a program command is entered. If the Reset command has not been enabled (the RSTE bit is in the Logical 0 \nstate), then any attempts at executing the Reset command will b e ignored.\nTo perform a Reset, the CS pin must first be asserted, and then the opcode F0h must be clocked into the device. No \naddress bytes need \nto be clocked in, but a confirmation byte of  D0h must be clocked into the device immediately after the \nopcode. Any additional data clocked into the device after the c onfirmation byte will be ignored. When the CS pin is \ndeasserted, the program operation currently in progress will be  terminated within a time of tSWRST . Since the program or \nerase operation may not complete before the device is reset, th e contents of the page being programmed or erased \ncannot be guaranteed to be valid.\nThe Reset command has no effect on the states of the Configurat ion Register or RSTE bit in the Status Register. Apart \nfrom Sequential Programming, the WEL bit will be reset back to its default state. \nThe\n complete opcode and confirmation byte must be clocked into the device before the CS pin is deasserted, and the CS \npin must be deasserted on an even byte boundary (multiples of e ight bits); otherwise, no Reset operation will be \nperformed.SCKCS\nHOLD\nHold Hold Hold\n\n 3 7 AT25DF041B \n DS-25DF041B–040G–02/2022Table 12-3.

Power-On/Reset State\nWhen power is first applied to the device, or when recovering f rom a reset condition, the output pin (SO) will be in a high\nimpedance state, a nd a high-to-low transition on the CSB pin will be requ ired to start a valid instruction. The SPI mode\n(Mode 3 or Mode 0) will be automatically selected on every fall ing edge of CSB by sampling the inactive clock state.\n14.1 Power-Up/Power-Down Vol tage and Timing Requirements\nDuring power-up, the device must not be READ for at least the m inimum tVCSL time after the supply voltage reaches the \nminimum VPOR level (VPOR min). While the device is bei ng powered-up, the internal Power -On Reset (POR) circuitry \nkeeps the device in a reset mode until the supply voltage rises above the minimum Vcc. During this time, all operations \nare disabled and the device will not respond to any commands.\nIf the first operation to the device after power-up will be a p rogram or erase operation, then the operation cannot be \nstarted until the \nsupply voltage reaches the minimum VCC  level and an internal device delay has elapsed. This delay wil l \nbe a maximum time of tPUW. After the tPUW time, the device will be in the standby mode if CSB is at logic high or active \nmode if CSB is at logic low. For the case of Power-down then Po wer-up operation, or if a power interruption occurs (such \nthat VCC drops below VPOR max), the Vcc of the Flash device must be maintained below VPWD for at least the minimum \nspecified TPWD time. This is to ensure the Flash device will reset properly after a power interruption. \nTable 14-1. Voltage and Timing Requirements for Power-Up/Power-D own\nFigure 14-1.
