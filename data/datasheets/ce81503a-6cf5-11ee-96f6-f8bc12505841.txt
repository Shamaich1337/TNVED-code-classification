Input offset voltage and input \noffset voltage drift are laser trimmed for precision performance. \nThe ultralow input current of the part is achieved with Topgate™ \nJFET technology, a process development exclusive to Analog Devices, Inc. This technology allows fabrication of extremely low input current JFETs compatible with a standard junction isolated bipolar process. The 10\n15 Ω common-mode impedance, \nwhich results from the bootstrapped input stage, ensures that \nthe input current is essentially independent of the common-\nmode voltage. \nThe AD549 is suited for applications requiring very low input \ncurrent and low input offset voltage. It excels as a preamp for a \nwide variety of current output transducers, such as photodiodes, photomultiplier tubes, or oxygen sensors. The AD549 can also \nbe used as a precision integrator or low droop sample-and-hold. \nThe AD549 is pin compatible with standard FET and electrometer \nop amps, allowing designers to upgrade the performance of \npresent systems at little additional cost. \nThe AD549 is available in a TO-99 hermetic package. The case \nis connected to Pin 8, thus, the metal case can be independently  connected to a point at the same potential as the input terminals, \nminimizing stray leakage to the case. The AD549  is available in \nfour performance grades. The J, K, and L versions are rated over \nthe commercial temperature range of 0°C to +70°C. The S grade \nis specified over the military temperature range of −55°C to +125°C and is available processed to MIL-STD-883B, Rev. C. Extended reliability plus screening is also available. Plus screening includes 168 hour burn-in, as well as other environmental and physical tests derived from MIL-STD-883B, Rev. C.  \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. The AD549 input currents are specified, 100% tested, and \nguaranteed after the device is warmed up. They are guaran-\nteed over the entire common-mode input voltage range.  \n2. The AD549 input offset voltage and drift are laser trimmed \nto 0.50 mV and 15 μV/°C (AD549K ), and to 1 mV and \n20 μV/°C ( AD549J ).  \n3. A maximum quiescent supply current of 700 μA minimizes heating effects on input current and offset voltage.  \n4. AC specifications include 1 MHz unity-gain bandwidth \nand 3 V/μs slew rate. Settling time for a 10 V input step is \n5 μs to 0.01%.  \nAD549 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

K | Page 10 of 18 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nMINIMIZING INPUT CURRENT \nThe AD549 is optimized for low input current and offset \nvoltage. Careful attention to how the amplifier is used reduces \ninput currents in actual applications.  \nKeep the amplifier operating temperature as low as possible to \nminimize input current. Like other JFET input amplifiers, the AD549 input current is sensitive to chip temperature, rising by  \na factor of 2.3 for every 10°C. Figure 25 is a plot of the AD549 \ninput current vs. ambient temperature.  \n1nA\n100pA\n10pA\n1pA\n100fA\n10fA\n1fA\n–55 –25 5 35 65 125 95\n00511-025\nTEMPERATURE (°C)INPUT BIAS CURRENT\n \nFigure 25. Input Bias Current vs. Ambient Temperature \nOn-chip power dissipation raises the chip operating tempera-\nture, causing an increase in input bias current. Due to the low quiescent supply current of the AD549, the chip temperature  \nis less than 3°C higher than its ambient temperature when the (unloaded) amplifier is operating with 15 V supplies. The difference in the input current is negligible.  \nHowever, heavy output loads can cause a significant increase in \nchip temperature and a corresponding increase in the input \ncurrent. Maintaining a minimum load resistance of 10 Ω is recommended. Input current vs. additional power dissipation \ndue to output drive current is plotted in Figure 26.  \n6\n5\n4\n321\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\n00511-026\nADDITIONAL INTERNAL POWER DISSIPATION (mW)NORMALIZED INPUT BIAS CURRENTBASED ON\nTYPICAL I B = 40fA\n \nFigure 26.

Sources of Parasitic Leakage Currents \nFinite resistance from input lines to voltages on the board, \nmodeled by Resistor R P, results in parasitic leakage. Insulation \nresistance of more than 1015 Ω must be maintained between  \nthe amplifier signal and supply lines to capitalize on the low \ninput currents of the AD549. Standard PCB material does not \nhave high enough insulation resistance; therefore, connect the \ninput leads of the AD549 to standoffs made of insulating \nmaterial with adequate volume resistivity (that is, Teflon®). The surface of the insulator must be kept clean to preserve surface \nresistivity. For Teflon, an effective cleaning procedure consists \nof swabbing the surface with high grade isopropyl alcohol, rinsing with deionized water, and baking the board at 80°C for \n10 minutes. \nIn addition to high volume and surface resistivity, other proper-\nties are desirable in the insulating material chosen. Resistance  to water absorption is important because surface water films \ndrastically reduce surface resistivity. The insulator chosen \nshould also exhibit minimal piezoelectric effects (charge emission due to mechanical stress) and triboelectric effects (charge generated by friction). Charge imbalances generated  by these mechanisms can appear as parasitic leakage currents. \nThese effects are modeled by Variable Capacitor C\nP in Figure 27. \nTable 3 lists various insulators and their properties.2 \nGuarding the input lines by completely surrounding them with \na metal conductor biased near the potential of the input lines has two major benefits. First, parasitic leakage from the signal line is reduced because the voltage between the input line and the guard is very low. Second, stray capacitance at the input \nnode is minimized. Input capacitance can substantially degrade \nsignal bandwidth and the stability of the I-to-V converter.  \n \n2 Electronic Measurements , pp. 15–17, Keithley Inst ruments, Inc., Cleveland, \nOhio, 1977. \nData Sheet AD549\n \nRev.

This minimizes pin \nleakage and input common-mode capacitance due to the case.

Noninverting Amplifier with Guard \nOther guidelines include keeping the circuit layout as compact as possible and keeping the input lines short. Keeping the assembly rigid and minimizing sources of vibration reduces triboelectric and piezoelectric effects. All precision, high impedance circuitry requires shielding against interference noise. Use low noise coaxial or triaxial cables for remote connections to the input signal lines. OFFSET NULLING \nThe AD549 input offset voltage can be nulled by using balance \nPin 1 and Pin 5, as shown in Figure 30. Nulling the input offset voltage in this fashion introduces an added input offset voltage drift component of 2.4 μV/°C per mV of nulled offset (a maximum \nadditional drift of 1.2 μV/°C for the AD549K  and AD549L , and \n2.4 μV/°C for the AD549J ). \n00511-0302\n36\n5\n17\n4AD549 +\nVOUT\n–\n–VS+VS\n10kΩ\n \nFigure 30.

The effects of \ncommon-mode and differential input capacitances should be taken into account because the circuit bandwidth and stability \ncan be adversely affected.  \n00511-032\n10mV 5µs\n \nFigure 32.

Follower Pulse Response from 1 MΩ Source Resistance,  \nCase Bootstrapped \nIn a follower, the source resistance and input common-mode \ncapacitance form a pole that limits the bandwidth to ½πR SCS. \nBootstrapping the metal case by connecting Pin 8 to the output minimizes capacitance due to the package. Figure 32 and Figure 33 show the follower pulse response from a 1 MΩ source \nresistance with and without the package connected to the \noutput. Typical common-mode input capacitance for the \nAD549 is 0.8 pF.  In an inverting configuration, the differential input capacitance \nforms a pole in the loop transmission of the circuit. This can create peaking in the ac response and possible instability. A feedback capacitance can be used to stabilize the circuit. The \ninverter pulse response with R\nF and R S equal to 1 MΩ appears  \nin Figure 34. Figure 35 shows the response of the same circuit  \nwith a 1 pF feedback capacitance. Typical differential input \ncapacitance for the AD549 is 1 pF.  \n00511-034\n10mV 5µs\n \nFigure 34.

Inverter Pulse Response with 1 MΩ Source  \nand Feedback Resistance, 1 pF Feedback Capacitance \nCOMMON-MODE INPUT VOLTAGE OVERLOAD \nThe rated common-mode input voltage range of the AD549 is \nfrom 3 V less than the positive supply voltage to 5 V greater than \nthe negative supply voltage. Exceeding this range degrades the CMRR of the amplifier. Driving the common-mode voltage above the positive supply causes the amplifier output to saturate at the \nupper limit of the output voltage. Recovery time is typically 2 μs \nafter the input has been returned to within the normal operating range. Driving the input common-mode voltage within 1 V of the negative supply causes phase reversal of the output signal. In this case, normal operation typically resumes within 0.5 μs of the input voltage returning within range.  \nData Sheet AD549\n \nRev. K | Page 13 of 18 DIFFERENTIAL INPUT VOLTAGE OVERLOAD \nA plot of the AD549 input currents vs. differential input  \nvoltage (defined as V IN+ − V IN−) appears in Figure 36. The  \ninput current at either terminal stays below a few hundred \nfemtoamps until one input terminal is forced higher than 1 V  \nto 1.5 V above the other terminal.

Input Current vs. Differential Input Voltage \nINPUT PROTECTION \nThe AD549 safely handles any input voltage within the supply \nvoltage range. Subjecting the input terminals to voltages beyond \nthe power supply can destroy the device or cause shifts in input \ncurrent or offset voltage if the amplifier is not protected.  \nA protection scheme for the amplifier as an inverter is shown  \nin Figure 37. R P is chosen to limit the current through the \ninverting input to 1 mA for expected transient (less than 1 sec) overvoltage conditions, or to 100 μA for a continuous overload. Because R\nP is inside the feedback loop and is much lower in \nvalue than the amplifier input resistance, it does not affect the dc gain of the inverter. However, the Johnson noise of the \nresistor adds root sum of squares to the amplifier input noise.  \n00511-0372\n36 AD549CF\nSOURCERPROTECTRF\n \nFigure 37. Inverter with Input Current Limit \nIn the corresponding version of this scheme for a follower, \nshown in Figure 38, R P and the capacitance at the positive input \nterminal produce a pole in the signal frequency response at a  f = ½πRC. Again, the Johnson noise, R\nP, adds to the input \nvoltage noise of the amplifier.  \n00511-0383\n26 AD549SOURCERPROTECT\n \nFigure 38. Follower with Input Current Limit \nFigure 39 is a schematic of the AD549 as an inverter with an \ninput voltage clamp. Bootstrapping the clamp diodes at the inverting input minimizes the voltage across the clamps and keeps the leakage due to the diodes low. Use low leakage diodes, such as the FD333s, and shield them from light to prevent photo-currents from being generated. Even with these precautions, the diodes measurably increase input current and capacitance. \n00511-0392\n36 AD549SOURCERF\nPROTECT\nDIODES  \nFigure 39. Input Voltage Clamp with Diodes \nSAMPLE-AND-DIFFERENCE CIRCUIT TO MEASURE \nELECTROMETER LEAKAGE CURRENTS \nThere are a number of methods used to test electrometer leakage \ncurrents, including current integration and direct I-to-V con-version. Regardless of the method used, board and interconnect \ncleanliness, proper choice of insulating materials (such as Teflon or Kel-F), correct guarding and shielding techniques, and care in physical layout are essential to making accurate leakage \nmeasurements. \nFigure 40 is a schematic of the sample-and-difference circuit. It \nuses two AD549 electrometer amplifiers (A and B) as I-to-V \nconverters with high value (10\n10 Ω) sense resistors (RSa and \nRSb). R1 and R2 provide for an overall circuit sensitivity of  10 fA/mV (10 pA full scale). C\nC and C F provide noise suppression \nand loop compensation. C C should be a low leakage polystyrene \ncapacitor. An ultralow leakage Kel-F test socket is used for con-tacting the device under test. Rigid Teflon coaxial cable is used \nto make connections to all high impedance nodes. The use of \nrigid coaxial cable affords immunity to error induced by mechan-ical vibration and provides an outer conductor for shielding. The \nentire circuit is enclosed in a grounded metal box.  \nAD549 Data Sheet\n \nRev. K | Page 14 of 18 The test apparatus is calibrated without a device under test \npresent. After power is turned on, a 5 minute stabilization period is required. First, V\nERR1 and V ERR2 are measured.

Sample and Difference Circuit for Measuring  \nElectrometer Leakage Currents \nOnce measured, these errors are subtracted from the readings \ntaken with a device under test present. Amplifier B closes the \nfeedback loop to the device under testing in addition to pro-\nviding the I-to-V conversion. The offset error of the device under testing appears as a common-mode signal and does not affect the test measurement. As a result, only the leakage \ncurrent of the device under testing is measured. \nV\nA – VERR1 = 10[ RSa × IB(+)] \nVX – VERR2 = 10[ RSb × IB(–)] Although a series of devices can be tested after only one calibra-\ntion measurement, calibration should be updated periodically to compensate for any thermal drift of the I-to-V converters or changes in the ambient environment. Laboratory results have \nshown that repeatable measurements within 10 fA can be realized \nwhen this apparatus is properly implemented. These results are achieved in part by the design of the circuit, which eliminates relays and other parasitic leakage paths in the high impedance signal lines, and in part by the inherent cancellation of errors through the calibration and measurement procedure.  \nPHOTODIODE INTERFACE \nThe low input current and low input offset voltage of the AD549 \nmake it an excellent choice for very sensitive photodiode preamps \n(see Figure 41). The photodiode develops a signal current, I S, \nequal to \nIS = R × P \nwhere P is light power incident on the diode surface, in watts, \nand R is the photodiode responsivity in amps/watt.

Also, R F/RS increases with tempera-\nture because photodiode shunt resistance typically drops by a \nfactor of 2 for every 10°C rise in temperature. An op amp with low offset voltage and low drift must be used to maintain accuracy. \nThe AD549K  offers a guaranteed maximum 0.50 mV offset \nvoltage and 15 mV/°C drift for very sensitive applications.  \nPhotodiode Preamp Noise \nNoise limits the signal resolution obtainable with the preamp. The output voltage noise divided by the feedback resistance is the minimum current signal that can be detected. This mini-\nmum detectable current divided by the responsivity of the photodiode represents the lowest light power that is detectable \nby the preamp. \nNoise sources associated with the photodiode, amplifier, and \nfeedback resistance are shown in Figure 43; Figure 44 is the spectral density vs. frequency plot of the contribution of each of \nthe noise sources to the output voltage noise (circuit parameters \nin Figure 42 are assumed). The rms contribution of each noise source to the total output voltage noise is obtained by integrating the square of its spectral density function over frequency. The rms value of the output voltage noise is the square root of the sum of all contributions. Minimizing the total \narea under these curves optimizes the resolution of the \npreamplifier for a given bandwidth.  \n00511-043A IS RS CSCFRFIF\nENIN\n \nFigure 43. Photodiode Preamp Noise Sources \nThe photodiode preamp in Figure 41 can detect a signal current \nof 26 fA rms at a bandwidth of 16 Hz, which, assuming a photodiode responsivity of 0.5 A/W , translates to a 52 fW rms minimum detectable power. The photodiode used has a high \nsource resistance and low junction capacitance. C\nF sets the \nsignal bandwidth with R F and also limits the peak in the noise  gain that multiplies the op amp input voltage noise contribu-\ntion. A single-pole filter at the output of the amplifier limits the op amp output voltage noise bandwidth to 26 Hz, comparable to the signal bandwidth. This greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the preamplifier (in this case, by a factor of 3). \n10µ\n1µ\n100n\n10n\n1 10 100 1k 10k 100k 1M\n00511-044\nFREQUENCY (Hz)VOLTAGE NOISE CONTRIBUTIONS\nNOISE SPECTRAL DENSITY (nV/  Hz)IF AND CS, NO FILTERS\nIF AND CS, WITH FILTERS\nEN\nCONTRIBUTION,WITH FILTEREN CONTRIBUTION,NO FILTERAD549\nOPEN-LOOP GAIN\n \nFigure 44. Spectral Density of the Photodiode Preamp Noise  \nSources vs. Frequency \nLOG RATIO AMPLIFIER  \nLogarithmic ratio circuits are useful for processing signals with \nwide dynamic range. The 60 fA maximum input current of the AD549L  makes it possible to build a log ratio amplifier with  \n1% log conformance for input currents ranging from 10 pA to \n1 mA, a dynamic range of 160 dB.  \nThe log ratio amplifier in Figure 45 provides an output voltage \nproportional to the log base 10 of the ratio of Input Current I\n1 \nand Input Current I 2. Resistor R1 and Resistor R2 are provided \nfor voltage inputs. Because NPN devices are used in the feedback \nloop of the front-end amplifiers that provide the log transfer \nfunction, the output is valid only for positive input voltages and input currents. The input currents set the Collector Current IC1 and Collector Current IC2 of a matched pair of log transistors, \nQ1 and Q2, to develop Voltage V\nA and Voltage V B \nVA, VB = –(kT/q)ln IC/IES \nwhere IES is the saturation current of the transistor. \nThe difference of V A and V B is taken by the subtractor section to \nobtain \nVC = (kT/q)ln(IC2/IC1) \nVC is scaled up by the ratio of (R9 + R10)/R8, which is equal to \napproximately 16 at room temperature, resulting in the output voltage  \nV\nOUT = 1 V × log( IC2/IC1) \nR8 is a resistor with a positive 3500 ppm/°C temperature coeffi-\ncient to provide the necessary temperature compensation.

K | Page 16 of 18 Frequency compensation is provided by R11, R12, C1, and C2. \nThe bandwidth of the circuit is 300 kHz at input signals greater than 50 μA; bandwidth decreases smoothly with decreasing \nsignal levels.  \nTo trim the circuit, set the input currents to 10 μA and trim the \nA3 offset using the trim potentiometer of the amplifier for the \noutput to equal 0. Next, set I\n1 to 1 μA and adjust the output to \nequal 1 V by trimming R10. Additional offset trims on Ampli-\nfier A1 and Amplifier A2 can be used to increase the voltage \ninput accuracy and dynamic range.  \nThe very low input current of the AD549 makes this circuit \nuseful over a very wide range of signal currents. The total input \ncurrent (which determines the low level accuracy of the circuit) \nis the sum of the amplifier input current, the leakage across the \ncompensating capacitor (negligible if a polystyrene or Teflon capacitor is used), and the collector-to-collector and collector-to-base leakages of one side of the dual log transistors. The magnitudes of these last two leakages depend on the amplifier \ninput offset voltage and are typically less than 10 fA with 1 mV \noffsets. The low level accuracy is limited primarily by the amplifier input current, only 60 fA maximum when the \nAD549L  is used.  \nThe effects of the emitter resistance of Q1 and Q2 can degrade \ncircuit accuracy at input currents above 100 μA. The networks composed of R13, D1, R16, R14, D2, and R17 compensate for these errors, so that this circuit has less than a 1% log confor-mance error at 1 mA input currents. The correct value for R13 and R14 depends on the type of log transistors used. The 49.9 kΩ \nresistors were chosen for use with LM394 transistors. Smaller \nresistance values are needed for smaller log transistors. \nTEMPERATURE COMPENSATED pH PROBE \nAMPLIFIER \nA pH probe can be modeled as an mV-level voltage source  \nwith a series source resistance dependent on the electrode \ncomposition and configuration. The glass bulb resistance of a typical pH electrode pair falls between 10\n6 Ω and 109 Ω. It is \ntherefore important to select an amplifier with low enough input currents such that the voltage drop produced by the amplifier input bias current and the electrode resistance does \nnot become an appreciable percentage of a pH unit.  \nThe circuit in Figure 46 illustrates the use of the AD549 as a pH \nprobe amplifier. As with other electrometer applications, the use of \nguarding, shielding, and Teflon standoffs is necessary to capitalize \non the AD549  low input current. If an AD549L  (60 fA maximum \ninput current) is used, the error contributed by the input current is \nheld below 60 μV for pH electrode source impedances up to 10\n9 Ω. \nInput offset voltages (which can be trimmed) are below 0.5 mV .  \n \n00511-0453\n26\n5\n1\n4A3\nAD549\nR10\n2kΩ10kΩ\nOUTPUT\nOFFSETSCALEFACTORADJV\nOUT\nR9\n14.3kΩ R81kΩ **\nR4\n20kΩ\n4.99kΩR6\n20kΩR7\n15kΩR15\n1kΩ\nR5\n20kΩR3\n20kΩ0.1µF\n0.1µF+VSFOR EACH AMPLIFIE R\nPIN 7\nPIN 4 –VS\n2\n36\n5\n1\n4A2\nAD549\nV2\nOFFSET10kΩD4I2 INV2 IN\nC2\n100pFR2\n10kΩ\nQ2BD2D1I1 IN 26514\nA1\nAD549V1\nOFFSET10kΩ\nD33\nV1 INR1\n10kΩ\nQ1AC1\n100pFR11\n4.99kΩ\nR14\n49.9kΩR1610Ω\nR1710Ω R1349.9kΩQ1, Q2 = LM394DUAL LOG TRANSISTORS\nD1, D4 1N4148 DIODESR8, R15 1kΩ  + 350 ppm/°C TC RESISTOR\n*TELLAB QB1 OR PRECISION RESISTOR PT146\nALL OTHER RESISTORS ARE 1% METAL FILMVOUT = 1V × LOG 10V2\nV1\nVOUT = 1V × LOG 10I2\nI1\n \nFigure 45.

The slope of the transfer function of the probe, though predictable, is temperature dependent (−54.2 mV/pH at 0°C and −74.04 mV/pH at 100°C).
