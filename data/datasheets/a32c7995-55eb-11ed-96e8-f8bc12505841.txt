Its new DMOS topol-ogy provides significant improvement over previous designs,including low-dropout voltage (only 250mV typ at full load),and better transient performance. In addition, no outputcapacitor is required for stability, unlike conventional low-dropout regulators that are difficult to compensate and re-quire expensive low ESR capacitors greater than 1 µF.\nTypical ground pin current is only 850 µA (at I\nOUT = 400mA)\nand drops to 10nA when not enabled. Unlike regulators withPNP pass devices, quiescent current remains relatively con-stant over load variations and under dropout conditions.\nThe REG113 has very low output noise (typically 28 µVrms\nfor V\nOUT = 3.3V with CNR = 0.01µF), making it ideal for use\nin portable communications equipment. Accuracy is main-\ntained over temperature, line, and load variations. Keyparameters are tested over the specified temperature range(–40°C to +85 °C).\nThe REG113 is well protected—internal circuitry provides acurrent limit which protects the load from damage, further-more, thermal protection circuitry keeps the chip from beingdamaged by excessive temperature. The REG113 is avail-able in SOT23-5 and MSOP-8 packages.SBVS031D – MARCH 2001 – REVISED SEPTEMBER  2005\nREG113Enable\nGND0.1µF COUT(1)++VOUT VIN\nNR(2)\nNOTES: (1) Optional.

The REG113 belongs to afamily of new generation LDO regulators that use a DMOSpass transistor to achieve ultra low-dropout performanceand freedom from output capacitor constraints. Ground pincurrent remains under 1mA over all line, load, and tempera-ture conditions. All versions have thermal and over-currentprotection, including foldback current limit.\nThe REG113 does not require an output capacitor for\nregulator stability and is stable over most output currentsand with almost any value and type of output capacitor upto 10µF or more. For applications where the regulator output\ncurrent drops below several milliamps, stability can beenhanced by adding a 1k Ω to 2kΩ load resistor, using\ncapacitance values smaller than 10 µF, or keeping the effec-\ntive series resistance greater than 0.05 Ω including the\ncapacitor ESR and parasitic resistance in printed circuitboard traces, solder joints, and sockets.\nAlthough an input capacitor is not required, it is a good\nstandard analog design practice to connect a 0.1 µF low\nESR capacitor across the input supply voltage; this isrecommended to counteract reactive input sources andimprove ripple rejection by reducing input voltage ripple.Figure 1 shows the basic circuit connections for the fixedvoltage models.\nINTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT\nThe REG113 internal current limit has a typical value of500mA. A foldback feature limits the short-circuit current toa typical short-circuit value of 200mA. A curve of V\nOUT\nversus IOUT is given in Figure 2, and in the Typical Charac-\nteristics section.FIGURE 1.

Foldback Current Limit of the REG113-3.3 at 25 °C.\nREG1139\nSBVS031D www.ti.comOUTPUT NOISE\nA precision bandgap reference is used to generate the\ninternal reference voltage, VREF. This reference is the domi-\nnant noise source within the REG113 and generates approxi-mately 29 µVrms in the 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth at the\nreference output. The regulator control loop gains up thereference noise, so that the noise voltage of the regulator isapproximately given by:\nV VrmsRR\nRVrmsV\nVNOUT\nREF=µ+=µ • 2922912(1)\nSince the value of VREF is 1.26V, this relationship reduces to:\nVVrms\nVVN OUT =µ• 23 (2)\nConnecting a capacitor, CNR, from the Noise Reduction (NR)\npin to ground (as shown in Figure 3) forms a low-pass filterfor the voltage reference. For C\nNR = 10nF, the total noise in\nthe 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth is reduced by approximatelya factor of 2.8 for V\nOUT = 3.3V. This noise reduction effect is\nshown in Figure 4, and as RMS Noise Voltage vs CNR in the\nTypical Characteristics section.\nNoise can be further reduced by carefully choosing an output\ncapacitor, COUT. Best overall noise performance is achieved\nwith very low (< 0.22 µF) or very high (> 2.2 µF) values of COUT\n(see the RMS Noise Voltage vs COUT typical characteristic).\nThe REG113 uses an internal charge pump to develop an\ninternal supply voltage sufficient to drive the gate of theDMOS pass element above V\nIN. The charge-pump switching\nnoise (nominal switching frequency = 2MHz) is not measur-able at the output of the regulator over most values of I\nOUT\nand COUT.\nDROPOUT VOLTAGE\nThe REG113 uses an N-channel DMOS as the pass ele-ment. When (V\nIN – VOUT) is less than the dropout voltage\n(VDROP), the DMOS pass device behaves like a resistor;\ntherefore, for low values of (VIN – VOUT), the regulator input-\nto-output resistance is the RdsON of the DMOS pass element\n(typically 600m Ω). For static (DC) loads, the REG113 willFIGURE 4.

The ability to remove heat from the die is different for eachpackage type and, therefore, presents different considerationsin the printed circuit board (PCB) layout. On the MSOP-8\npackage, leads 5 through 8 are fused to the lead frame and maybe used to improve the thermal performance of the package.The PCB area around the device that is free of other compo-nents moves the heat from the device to the ambient air.Although it is difficult or impossible to quantify all of the\nvariables in a thermal design of this type, performance data forseveral simplified configurations are shown in Figure 6. In allcases the PCB copper area is bare copper, free of solder resistmask, and not solder plated. All examples are for 1-ouncecopper and in the case of the MSOP-8, the copper area isconnected to fused leads 5 to 8. See Figure 7 for thermal\nresistance for varying areas of copper. Using heavier copper\ncan increase the effectiveness in removing the heat from thedevice. In those examples where there is copper on both sidesof the PCB, no connection has been provided between the twosides. The addition of plated through holes will improve the heatsink effectiveness.For large step changes in load current, the REG113 requiresa larger voltage drop across it to avoid degraded transientresponse. The boundary of this transient dropout region isshown as the top line in Figure 5. Values of V\nIN to VOUT voltage\ndrop above this line insure normal transient response.\nIn the transient dropout region between DC and Transient,transient response recovery time increases. The time required torecover from a load transient is a function of both the magnitudeand rate of the step change in load current and the availableheadroom V\nIN to VOUT voltage drop. Under worst-case condi-\ntions (full-scale load change with (VIN – VOUT) voltage drop close\nto DC dropout levels), the REG113 can take several hundredmicroseconds to re-enter the specified window of regulation.\nTRANSIENT RESPONSE\nThe REG113 response to transient line and load conditionsimproves at lower output voltages. The addition of a capacitor(nominal value 0.47 µF) from the output pin to ground may\nimprove the transient response. In the adjustable version, theaddition of a capacitor, C\nFB (nominal value 10nF), from the\noutput to the adjust pin also improves the transient response.\nTHERMAL PROTECTION\nPower dissipated within the REG113 can cause the junctiontemperature to rise, however, the REG113 has thermalshutdown circuitry that protects the regulator from damage.The thermal protection circuitry disables the output whenthe junction temperature reaches approximately 160 °C,\nallowing the device to cool. When the junction temperaturecools to approximately 140 °C, the output circuitry is again\nenabled. Depending on various conditions, the thermalprotection circuit can cycle on and off. This limits thedissipation of the regulator, but can have an undesirableeffect on the load.\nAny tendency to activate the thermal protection circuit indi-cates excessive power dissipation or an inadequate heat sink.For reliable operation, junction temperature should be limitedto 125°C, maximum. To estimate the margin of safety in a\ncomplete design (including heat sink), increase the ambienttemperature until the thermal protection is triggered. Useworst-case loads and signal conditions. For good reliability,thermal protection should trigger more than 35 °C above the\nmaximum expected ambient condition of the application. Thisproduces a worst-case junction temperature of 125 °C at the\nhighest expected ambient temperature and worst-case load.\nThe internal protection circuitry of the REG113 is designed toprotect against overload conditions and is not intended toreplace proper heat sinking. Continuously running the REG113into thermal shutdown will degrade reliability.3.0\n2.52.01.51.00.5\n0Power Dissipation (W)MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION vs TEMPERATURE\n–50–25 0 25 50 75 100 125\nAmbient Temperature ( °C)Condition 1\nCondition 2Condition 3\nCONDITION PACKAGE PCB AREA θJA\n1 MSOP-8 1 sq. in.
