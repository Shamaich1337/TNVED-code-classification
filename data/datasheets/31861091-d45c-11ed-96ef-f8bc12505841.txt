It is a 16 output power switch having 24 bit serial control. The 33996 incorporates SMARTMOS \ntechnology having CMOS logic, bipolar\n / MOS analog circuitry, and independent DMOS  power output transistors. \nMany benefits are realized as a direct result of using this \nmixed technology. A simplified internal block diagram of the \n33996 is shown in Figure  2, page  2.\nFUNCTIONAL PIN DESCRIPTION\nCHIP SELECT ( CS)\nThe system MCU selects the 33996 to be communicated \nwith through the use of the Chip Select ( CS) pin. When the CS \npin is in a logic low state, data can be transferred from the \nMCU to the 33996 and vise versa. Clocked-in data from the MCU is transferred from the 33996 Shift register and latched \ninto the power outputs on the rising edge of the \nCS signal. On \nthe falling edge of the CS signal, output fault status \ninformation is transferred from  the Power Outputs Status \nregister into the device’s SO Sh ift register. The SO pin output \ndriver is enabled when CS is low, allowing information to be \ntransferred from the 33996 to the MCU. To avoid any \nspurious data, it is essential the high-to-low transition of the \nCS signal occur only when SCLK is in a logic low state.\nSYSTEM CLOCK (SCLK)\nThe System Clock (SCLK) pin clocks the Internal Shift \nregisters of the 33996. The Seri al Input (SI) pin accepts data \ninto the Input Shift register on  the falling edge of the SCLK \nsignal, while the Serial Output (SO) pin shifts data information \nout of the Shift register on the rising edge of the SCLK signal.  \nFalse clocking of the Shift register must be avoided, ensuring \nvalidity of data. It is  essential that the SCLK pin be in a logic \nlow state whenever the CS pin makes any transition. For this \nreason, it is recommended, t hough not necessary, that the \nSCLK pin is commanded to a low logic state as long as the device is not accessed (\nCS in logic high state). When the CS \nis in a logic high state, any signal at the SCLK and SI pins is \nignored and the SO is tri-stated (high impedance).\nSERIAL INPUT (SI)\nThe Serial Input (SI) pin is used to enter one of seven \nserial instructions into the 33996 . SI SPI bits are latched into \nthe Input Shift register on each  falling edge of SCLK. The \nShift register is full after 24  bits of information are entered. \nThe 33996 operates on the command word on the rising edge \nof CS. To preserve data integrity, exercise care not to \ntransition SI as SCLK transitions  from high to low state (see \nFigure  4, page  8).\nSERIAL OUTPUT (SO)\nThe Serial Output (SO) pin tran sfers fault status data from \nthe 33996 to the MCU. The SO pi n remains tri-state until the \nCS pin transitions to a logic low state. All faults on the 33996 \nare reported to the MCU as logic  [1]. Conversely, normal \noperating outputs with nonfault ed loads are reported as \nlogic [0]. On the falling edge of the CS signal, output fault status information is transferred from the Power Outputs \nStatus register into the device ’s SO Shift register. The first \neight positive transitions of SCLK will provide Any Fault (bit 23), over-voltage fault (bit 22),  followed by six logic\n [0]s (bits \n21 to 16). The next 16 successi ve positive transitions of \nSCLK provides fault status for output  15 to output 0. Refer to \nthe LOGIC OPERATION  section (below) for more \ninformation. The SI  / SO shifting of data follo ws a first-in, first-\nout protocol, with both input and output words transferring the \nMost Significant Bit (MSB) first. \nOUTPUT DRIVER POWER SUPPLY (SOPWR ) \nThe SOPWR pin is used to supply power to the 33996 SO \noutput driver and Power-ON Reset (POR) circuit. To achieve \nlow standby current on VPWR supply, power must be removed from the SOPWR pin. The 33996 will be in reset \nwith all drivers OFF when SO\nPWR is below 2.5V. The 33996 \ndoes not detect over-voltage on the SOPWR supply pin.\nOUTPUT/INPUT (OUT0  – OUT15)  \nThese pins are low side output switches controlling the \nload.\nRESET  (RST) \nThe Reset ( RST) pin is the active low reset input pin used \nto turn OFF all outputs, thereby clearing all internal registers. \nBATTERY INPUT (VPWR )\nThe VPWR pin is used as the input power source for the \n33996. The voltage on VPWR is monitored for over-voltage protection and shutdown. An over-voltage condition (> 50\nμs) \non the VPWR pin will cause the 33996 to shut down all \noutputs until the over-voltage condition is removed. Upon return to normal input voltage, the outputs will respond as \nprogrammed by the over-voltage bit in the Global Shutdown\n /\n Retry Control register. The over-voltage threshold on the \nVPWR pin is specified as 27.5 to 35  V with 1.4V typical \nhysteresis. Following an ove r-voltage shutdown of output \ndrivers, the over-voltage Fault and the Any Fault bits in the SO bit stream will be logic\n [1].\nPWM CONTROL (PWM)\nThe PWM Control pin is provided to support PWM of any \ncombination of outputs. The LOGIC OPERATION  section \ndescribes the logi c for PWM control.\n\nAnalog Integrated Circuit Device Data  \nFreescale Semiconductor 1133996FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\nOPERATIONAL MODES\nOPERATIONAL MODES\nOn each SPI communication, a 24 bit command word is \nsent to the 33996 and 24 bit fault word is received from the 33996. The Most Significant Bit (MSB) is sent and received \nfirst.Command Register Definition:  \n0 = Output Command Off  \n1 = Output Command On\nSO Definition:  \n0 = No fault  \n1 = Fault\nMCU INTERFACE DESCRIPTION\nIn operation the 33996 functions as a 16-output serial \nswitch serving as a microcontroller (MCU) bus expander and buffer with fault management and fault reporting features. In \ndoing so, the device directly relieves the MCU of the fault \nmanagement functions. \nThe 33996 directly interfaces to an MCU and operates at \nsystem clock serial frequencies up to 6.0MHz using a Serial \nPeripheral Interface (SPI) for control and diagnostic readout.Figure  9 shows the basic SPI configuration between an \nMCU and one 33996.\n Figure  9. 33996 SPI Interface with Microcontroller\nAll inputs are compatible with 3.3  / 5.0V CMOS logic levels \nand incorporate positive logic. An input that is programmed to \na logic low state (<  0.8V) will have the corresponding output \nOFF. Conversely, an input programmed to a logic high state \n(> 2.2V) will have the output being controlled ON. Table  5.

Data from the MCU is clocked daisy chain through each device while the Chip Select bit (\nCS) is commanded low \nby the MCU. During each clock cycle, output status from the \ndaisy-chained 33996s is being transferred back to the MCU \nvia the Master In Slave Out (MISO) line. On rising edge of CS, \ndata stored in the input register  is transferred to the output \ndriver.

The device allows PWM and ON  /OFF control \nthrough the use of several 24 bit input command words. This \nsection describes the logic operation and command registers of the 33996.\nThe 33996 message set consists of seven messages as \nshown in Table  6. Bits 23 through18 determine the specific command and bits 15 through 0 determine how a specific \noutput will operate. The 33996 operates on the command \nword on the rising edge of CS.\nNote   Upon Power-ON Reset all bits are defined as shown \nin Table  6.\nON/OFF CONTROL REGISTER\nTo program the 16 outputs of  the 33996 ON or OFF, a 24 \nbit serial stream of data is entered into the SI pin. The first 8\n bits of the control word are used to identify the on/off \ncommand and the remaining 16  bits are used to turn ON or \nOFF the specific output driver.\nOPEN LOAD CURRENT ENABLE CONTROL \nREGISTER\nThe Open Load Current Enabl e Control register is \nprovided to enable or disable the 50 μA open load detect pull-\ndown current. This feature allows the device to be used in \nLED applications. Power-ON Reset (POR) or the RST pin or \nthe RESET command disables the 50 μA pull-down current. \nNo open load fault will be re ported with the pull-down current \ndisabled. For open load to be active, the user must program the Open Load Current Enable Control register with logic\n [1].\nGLOBAL SHUTDOWN/RETRY CONTROL \nREGISTER\nThe Global Shutdown/Retry Control register allows the \nuser to select the global fault strategy for the outputs. The \nover-voltage control bit (bit  16) sets the operation of the outputs when returning from over-voltage. Setting the over-\nvoltage bit to logic  [0] will force all outputs to remain off when \nVPWR returns to normal level. Setting the over-voltage bit to \nlogic [1] will command outputs to re sume their previous state \nwhen VPWR returns to normal level. Bit  17 is the global \nthermal bit. When bit  17 is set to logic  [0], all outputs will shut \ndown when thermal limit is reached and remain off even after cooled. With bit\n 17 set to logic  [1], all outputs will shut down \nwhen thermal limit is reached and will retry when cooled.\nSHORT FAULT PROTECT DISABLE (SFPD) \nCONTROL REGISTER \nAll outputs contain current limit and thermal shutdown with \nprogrammable retry. The SFPD control bits are used for fast shutdown of the output when over-current condition is \ndetected but thermal shutdown has not been achieved. \nThe SFPD Control register allows the user to select \nspecific outputs for incandescent lamp loads and specific \noutputs for inductive loads. By programming the specific \nSFPD bit as logic  [1], output will rely on over-temperature \nshutdown only. Programming the specific SFPD bit as \nlogic [0] will shut down the output after 100 to 450 μs during \nturn on into short circuit. The decision for shutdown is based Table  6.

This feature \nis designed to provide protecti on to loads that experience \nmore than expected currents an d require fast shutdown. The \n33996 is designed to operate in both modes with full device \nprotection.\nPWM ENABLE REGISTER\nThe PWM Enable register dete rmines the outputs that are \nPWM controlled. The first 8  bits of the 24  bit SPI message \nword are used to identify the PWM enable command, and the remaining 16\n bits are used to enable and disable the PWM of \nthe output drivers.\nA logic  [0] in the PWM Enable register will disable the \noutputs as PWM. A logic  [1] in the PWM Enable register will \nset the specific output as a PWM. Power-ON Reset or the \nRST pin or the RESET command will set the PWM Enable \nregister to logic  [0].\nAND/OR CONTROL REGISTER\nThe AND  /OR Control register describes the condition by \nwhich the PWM pin controls the output driver. A logic  [0] in \nthe AND  /OR Control register will AND the PWM input pin with \nthe ON  /OFF Control register bit. Likewise, a logic  [1] in the \nAND  /OR Control register will OR the PWM input pin with the \nON /OFF Control register bit (see Figure  12). For the AND  /OR control to occur, the PWM Enable bit must be set to \nlogic [1].\n Figure  12. PWM Control Logic Diagram\nSERIAL OUTPUT (SO) RESPONSE REGISTER \nFault reporting is accomplished through the SPI interface. \nAll logic  [1s] received by the MCU via the SO pin indicate \nfault. All logic  [0s] received by the MCU via the SO pin \nindicate no fault. All fault bits are cleared on the positive edge \nof CS. SO bits  15 to 0 represent the fault status of outputs  15 \nto 0. SO bits 21 to 16 will always return logic  [0]. Bit  22 \nprovides over-voltage condition status and bit  23 is set when \nany fault is present in the IC. The timing between two write \nwords must be greater than 450 μs to allow adequate time to \nsense and report the proper fault status.\nRESET COMMAND\nThe RESET command turns all outputs OFF and sets the \nfollowing registers to a POR state (refer to Table  6). \n• ON/OFF Control Register\n• SFPD Control Register\n• PWM Enable Register\n• AND/OR Control Register\nThe Open Load Current Enable  and the Global Shutdown \nRegisters are not affected by the RESET command.

In Sleep mode (SOPWR ≤ 2.0V) the \ncurrent consumed by the VPWR pin is less than 10 μA. To \nplace the 33996 in Sleep mode, turn all outputs OFF and \nremove power from the SOPWR pin. During normal \noperation, 500 μA is drawn from the SOPWR supply and 8.0mA \nfrom the VPWR supply.\nParalleling of Outputs\nUsing MOSFETs as output swit ches allows the connection \nof any combination of outputs together. The RDS(ON)  of \nMOSFETs has an inherent posit ive temperature coefficient, \nproviding balanced current sh aring between outputs without \ndestructive operation. This mode of operation may be desirable in the event the application requires lower power \ndissipation or the added capability of switching higher \ncurrents. Performance of para llel operation results in a \ncorresponding decrease in R\nDS(ON) , while the Output Current \nLimit increases correspondingly. Output OFF Open Load \nDetect current may increase based on how the Output OFF \nOpen Load Detect is programmed. Paralleling outputs from \ntwo or more different IC devices is possible but not \nrecommended. \nCare must be taken when paralleling outputs for inductive \nloads. The Output Voltage Cla mp of the output drivers may \nnot match. One MOSFET out put must be capable of the \ninductive energy from the load turn OFF. \nSPI Integrity Check\nChecking the integrity of the SPI communication is \nrecommended upon initial power- up of the SOPWR pin. After \ninitial system start-up or re set, the MCU writes one 48-bit \npattern to the 33996.\nThe first 24  bits read by the MCU is the fault status of the \noutputs, while the second 24  bits is the first bit pattern sent. \nBy the MCU receiving the same bit pattern it sent, bus \nintegrity is confirmed. Please note the second 24  bits the \nMCU sends to the 33996 are the command bits and will program registers or activate outputs on the rising edge of \nCS.\nOutput OFF Open Load Fault\nAn Output OFF Open Load Fault is the detection and \nreporting of an open  load when the corresponding output is \ndisabled (input bit programmed to a logic low state). The Output OFF Open Load Fault is detected by comparing the \ndrain-to-source voltage of the s pecific MOSFET output to an \ninternally generated reference. Each output has one \ndedicated comparator for this purpose.\nEach 33996 output has an internal 50 μA pull-down current \nsource. The pull-down current is disabled on power-up and must be enabled for Open Load Detect to function. Once enabled, the 33996 will only shut down the pull-down current \nin Sleep mode or when disabled via the SPI. \nDuring output switching, especi ally with capacitive loads, \na false Output OFF Open Load Fault may be triggered. To \nprevent this false fault from bei ng reported, an internal fault \nfilter of 100 to 450 μs is incorporated. The duration for which \na false fault may be report ed is a function of the load \nimpedance, RDS(ON) , COUT of the MOSFET, as well as the \nsupply voltage, VPWR. The rising edge of CS triggers the built-\nin fault delay timer. The timer must time out before the fault \ncomparator is enabled to detect a faulted threshold. Once the condition causing the Open Load Fault is removed, the \ndevice resumes normal operation. The Open Load Fault, \nhowever, will be latched in the output SO Response register \nfor the MCU to read. \nShorted Load Fault\nA shorted load (over-current) fault can be caused by any \noutput being shorted directly to supply, or by an output \nexperiencing a current great er than the current limit.\nThree safety circuits progressively in operation during load \nshort conditions afford system protection:\n1. The device’s output current is monitored in an analog \nfashion using a SENSEFET approach and is current \nlimited. \n2. With the output in curren t limit, the drain-to-source \nvoltage will increase. By setting the SFPD bit to 0, the \noutput will shut down on VDS > 2.7V typical after \n450μs.\n3. The device’s output thermal limit is sensed and when \nattained causes only the s pecific faulted output to \nshutdown. The device remains OFF until cooled. The device then operates as programmed by the shutdown/\nretry bit. The cycle continues until the fault is removed \nor the command bit instructs the output OFF.\nAll three protection schemes set the Fault Status bit (bit  23 \nin the SO Response register) to logic  [1]. \nUnder-voltage Shutdown\nAn under voltage SOPWR condition results in the global \nshutdown of all outputs and reset of all control registers. The \nunder-voltage threshold is between 2.0 and 3.0V.\nAn under-voltage condition at the VPWR pin results in an \noutput shutdown and reset. The under-voltage threshold is between 3.2 and 3.5V. When V\nPWR is between 5.0 and 3.5V, \nthe output may operate per the command word and the status \nis reported on SO pin, th ough this is not guaranteed. \nOutput Voltage Clamp\nEach output of the 33996 incorporates an internal voltage \nclamp to provide fast turn-OFF  and transient protection of \neach output. Each clamp indep endently limits the drain-to-\nsource voltage to 50V. The total energy clamped (EJ) can be \n\nAnalog Integrated Circuit Device Data  \n16 Freescale Semiconductor33996TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\ncalculated by multiplying the current area under the current \ncurve (IA) times the clamp voltage (VCL) (see Figure 13 ). \nCharacterization of the output clamps, using a single pulse \nnon-repetitive method at 0. 3A, indicates the maximum \nenergy to be  50mJ at 150 °C junction temperature per output.\n Figure  13. Output Voltage Clamping\nReverse Battery Protection\nThe 33996 device requires external reverse battery \nprotection on the VPWR pin. All outputs consist of a power MOSFET with an integral \nsubstrate diode. During reverse battery condition, current will flow through the load via the substrate diode. Under this \ncircumstance relays may energize and lamps will turn on. If \nload reverse battery protection is desired, a diode must be placed in series with the load.\nOver-temperature Fault\nOver-temperature detect circuits are specifically \nincorporated for each individual output. The shutdown \nfollowing an over temperature condition depends on the control bit set in the Global Shutdown\n / Retry Control register. \nEach independent output shuts down at 155°C to 180°C. \nWhen an output shuts down due to an Over-temperature Fault, no other outputs are affe cted. The MCU recognizes the \nfault by a logic\n [1] in the Fault Status bit (bit  23 in the SO \nResponse register). After the 33996 has cooled below the switch point temperature and 10 °C hysteresis, the output will \nfunction as defined by the shutdown\n / retry bit  17 in the Global \nShutdown/Retry Control register.Current\nArea (IA)Clamp Energy \n(EJ = IA x VCL)Dra in  Vo ltag e\nTimeDra in-to-Source Clamp\nVoltage (VCL = 45 V)\nDrain Current\n(ID = 0.3 A)\nGN DDra in-to-Source ON\nVoltage (V DS( O N) ) 50 V) Drain-to-Source Clamp\nVoltage (VCL = 50V)\nDrain-to-Source ON\nVoltage (VDS(ON) )Drain Voltage\nClamp Energy(E\nJ = IAVG x VCL)\nGND TimeDrain Current\n(ID = 0.3A)\n\nAnalog Integrated Circuit Device Data  \nFreescale Semiconductor 1733996PACKAGING\nPACKAGE DIMENSIONS\nPACKAGING\nPACKAGE DIMENSIONS\nImportant : For the most current package revision, visit www.freescale.com  and search on keyword for 98A number listed \nbelow.\nEK SUFFIX (PB-FREE)\n32-PIN SOICW EP\n98ARL10543D\nREVISION C\n\nAnalog Integrated Circuit Device Data  \n18 Freescale Semiconductor33996PACKAGING\nPACKAGE DIMENSIONS (CONTINUED)\nPACKAGE DIMENSIONS (CONTINUED)\nEK SUFFIX (PB-FREE)\n32-PIN SOICW EP\n98ARL10543D\nREVISION C\n\nAnalog Integrated Circuit Device Data  \nFreescale Semiconductor 1933996PACKAGING\nPACKAGE DIMENSIONS (CONTINUED)\nEK SUFFIX (PB-FREE)\n32-PIN SOICW EP\n98ARL10543D\nREVISION C\n\nAnalog Integrated Circuit Device Data  \n20 Freescale Semiconductor33996ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION\nTHERMAL ADDENDUM (REV 2.0)\nADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION\nTHERMAL ADDENDUM (REV 2.0)\nIntroduction\nThis thermal addendum is provided as a supplement to the MC33996 technical \ndatasheet.
