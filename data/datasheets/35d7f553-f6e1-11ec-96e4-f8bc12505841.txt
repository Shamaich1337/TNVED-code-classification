The amount of \nthe capacitance may be increased without limit. This input capacitor must be located as close as possible to the device to as sure input sta bility \nand less noise. For PCB layout, a wide copper trace is required for both V IN and GND.  \n \nOutput Capacitor  \nThe output capacitor is required to stabilize and help transient response for LDO. The AP2127 is stable with very small ceram ic output capacitor  \nwith a low ESR 1 µF or higher of X7R or X5R MLCC capacitor , which will be sufficient at full temperature range s. Additional capacitance helps to \nreduce undershoot and overshoot during transient . Place output capacitor as close as possible to VOUT  and GND p ins, and keep the leads as \nshort as possible.  \n \nAdjustable Operation  \nFor adjustable version, the output voltage is calculated by:  \n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf02b\uf03d\n21\nREF OUTRR1 V V\n \n \nWhere V REF  = 0.8V (the internal reference voltage)  \n \nRearranging the equation will give the following that is used for adjusting the output to a particular voltage:  \n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf02d \uf03d 1VVR R\nREFOUT\n2 1\n \n \nFor AP2127, the resistor at the low side  (R2) can be selected fro m 5kΩ to 200kΩ.  \n \nIn order to improve the stability and to decrease the noise level of the adjustable ve rsion, a feed -forward capacitor is suggested to be placed \nbetween V OUT  and ADJ pins (Figure 1). It’s recommended that this feed -forward capacitor value can be calculated as:  \n  \n15kHz\nffC1R2π10.7kHz \uf0a3\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0a3\n \n \nThe recommended value of the feed -forward capacitor for different resistor divider ratios is shown in the table below.  \n \nOutput Voltage  R1 R2 Cff \n1.2V 7.5kΩ 15kΩ 2.7nF  \n1.6V 7.5kΩ 7.5kΩ 2.7nF  \n1.8V 22.5k Ω 18kΩ 1nF \n1.9V 7.5kΩ 5.49k Ω 2.7nF  \n2.5V 38.3k Ω 18kΩ 560pF  \n3.3V 56.2k Ω 18kΩ 390pF  \n4.0V 120k Ω 30.1k Ω 180pF  \n \nTable 1 .

Application Circuit with Feed -forward Capacitor  \n \nCurrent Limit Protection  \nWhen output current at VOUT  pin is higher than current limit threshold, the current limit protection will be triggered and clamp  the output current to \nprevent ov er-current and to protect the regulator and load from damage d due to overheating.  \n \nShort Circuit Protection  \nWhen  VOUT  pin is  shorted to GND, short circuit protection will be triggered and clamp the output current to approximately 50mA . \n \nAuto discharge with  Shutdown Version  \nFor shutdown version, an auto discharge MOSFET with R DS(ON)  of 60Ω typical is integrated between V OUT  and GND pins, which can discharge \nthe charge of the output capacitors quickly when turn ing off AP2127 with S hutdown  pin. \n \nThermal Consi deration  \nInternal thermal protection circuitry of AP2127  is used  to protect device during overload conditions. For continuous operation, ensure  not to \nexceed the operating junction temperature range of +125°C.  \n \nThe power dissipation definition in the device is:  \n \nPD = (V IN - VOUT) x I OUT + VIN x IQ \n \nThe maximum power dissipation depends on the thermal resistance of IC package, PCB layout and the surrounding airflow. The ma ximum power \ndissipation can also be calculated as:  \n \nPD(MAX)  = (T J(MAX)  - TA) / θJA \n \nThe maximum power dissipation for SOT -23-5 package (least copper size) at T A = +25°C can be calculated as:  \n \nPD(MAX)  = (125 °C - 25°C) / (250 °C/W) = 0.4W  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP2127  \nDocument number: DS 36478  Rev. 7 - 2 14 of 24 \nwww.diodes.com   December 2017  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2127  \n \n \nOrdering Information  \n \nAP2127 XX - XXX XX XX\nPacking Package\nTR : Tape & Reel N : SOT-23\nN3 : SOT-23-3Product Name Output Voltage\nADJ : Adjustable Output\n1.0 : Fixed Output 1.0V\n1.2 : Fixed Output 1.2V\n1.5 : Fixed Output 1.5V\n1.8 : Fixed Output 1.8V\n2.5 : Fixed Output 2.5VG1 : Green\nK : SOT-23-5\n2.8 : Fixed Output 2.8V\n3.0 : Fixed Output 3.0V\n3.3 : Fixed Output 3.3V\n4.2 : Fixed Output 4.2V\n4.75 : Fixed Output 4.75VRoHS/Green\nR : SOT-89\n  \nPart Number  Marking ID  Temperatur e Range  Package  Packa ging  \nAP2127N -1.0TRG1  GU8 \n-40° C to +85° C  SOT-23 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127N -1.2TRG1  GS8 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127N -1.5TRG1  GV8 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127N -1.8TRG1  GW8  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127N -2.5TRG1  GT9 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP21 27N-2.8TRG1  GU9 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127N -3.0TRG1  GV9 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127N -3.3TRG1  GW9  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127N3 -1.2TRG1  GU2 \nSOT-23-3 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127N3 -1.5TRG1  GU3 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -ADJTRG1  GEH  \nSOT-23-5 3000/ Tape & Re el \nAP2127K -1.0TRG1  GEG  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -1.2TRG1  GEI 3000/Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -1.5TRG1  GEP  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -1.8TRG1  GEQ  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -2.5TRG1  GER  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -2.8TRG1  GES  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -3.0TRG1  GHF  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -3.3TRG1  GET 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -4.2TRG1  GEU  3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127K -4.75TRG1  GEZ 3000/ Tape & Reel  \nAP2127R -3.3TRG1  G42P SOT-89 1000/ Tape & Reel  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP2127  \nDocument number: DS 36478  Rev. 7 - 2 15 of 24 \nwww.diodes.com   December 2017  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2127  \n \n \nMarki ng Information  \n \n(1) SOT-23, SOT-23-3 \n \n(Top View)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) SOT-23-5 \n \n(Top View)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Top View)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) SOT-89 \n \n(Top View)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 2 3\n1 2 34 5\n1 2 34 5\nXXXXXX \nXXXX  \nYWWAXX  \n: Logo  \nXXX : Marking ID (See Ordering Information)  \nFirst Line: Logo and Marking ID  (See Ordering Information)  \nSecond  Line: Date Cod e \nY: Year \nWW: Work Week of Molding  \nA: Assembly House Code \nXX: 7 th and 8 th Digits of Batch Number  \n: Logo  \nXXX : Marking ID (See Ordering Information)  \nXXX \nY W X  XXX : Marking ID  (See Ordering Information)  \nY : Year 0 to 9  \nW : Week : A to Z : 1 to 26 week;  \n      a to z : 27 to 52 week; z represents  \n      52 and 53 week  \nX : Internal Code  \n \nAP2127  \nDocument number: DS 36478  Rev. 7 - 2 16 of 24 \nwww.diodes.com   December 2017  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2127  \n \n \nPackage Outline Dimensions (All d imensions in m m.)   \n(1) Package Type: SOT-23 \n \n \n2.300(0.091)\n2.500(0.098)1.200(0.047)\n1.400(0.055)\n0.890(0.035)\n1.030(0.041)0.300(0.012)\n0.510(0.020)\n1.900(0.075)REF2.800(0.110)\n3.000(0.118)2.0°3.0°\n0.500(0.020)\n0.700(0.028)\n1.050(0.041)REF0.010(0.0004)\n0.100(0.004)0.900(0.035)\n1.100(0.043)4×R0.100(0.004)\n7.0°\n7.0°\n0.550(0.022)REF0.200(0.008)MIN0.100(0.004) GAUGE PLANE\n0.080(0.003)\n0.180(0.007)R0.100(0.004)\n0.0°~10.0°\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP2127  \nDocument number: DS 36478  Rev. 7 - 2 17 of 24 \nwww.diodes.com   December 2017  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2127  \n \n \nPackage Outline Dimensions (Cont.)
