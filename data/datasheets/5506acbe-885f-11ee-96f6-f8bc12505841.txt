Pin Configuration.\nTOP221-227\nD\n7/013TOPSwitch-II Family Functional Description\nTOPSwitch  is a self biased and protected linear control current-\nto-duty cycle converter with an open drain output.  Highefficiency is achieved through  the use of CMOS and integrationof the maximum number of functions possible.  CMOS processsignificantly reduces bias currents as compared to bipolar ordiscrete solutions.  Integration eliminates external powerresistors used for current sensing and/or supplying initial start-up bias current.\nDuring normal operation, the duty cycle of the internal output\nMOSFET decreases linearly with increasing CONTROL pincurrent as shown in Figure 4.  To implement all the requiredcontrol, bias, and protection functions, the DRAIN andCONTROL pins each perform several functions as describedbelow.  Refer to Figure 2 for a block diagram and to Figure 6 fortiming and voltage waveforms of the TOPSwitch  integrated\ncircuit.\nPI-2040-050197DMAX\nDMINDuty Cycle (%)\nIC (mA)2.0 6.0Slope = PWM GainIB\nICD1Auto-restart\nFigure 4.

Start-up Waveforms for (a) Normal Operation and (b) Auto-restart.\nTOP221-227\nD\n7/014Control Voltage SupplyCONTROL pin voltage V\nC is the supply or bias voltage for the\ncontroller and driver circuitry.  An external bypass capacitorclosely connected between the CONTROL and SOURCE pinsis required to supply the gate drive current.  The total amountof capacitance connected to this pin (C\nT) also sets the auto-\nrestart timing as well as control loop compensation.  VC is\nregulated in either of two modes of operation.  Hystereticregulation is used for initial start-up and overload operation.Shunt regulation is used to separate the duty cycle error signalfrom the control circuit supply current.  During start-up,CONTROL pin  current is supplied from a high-voltage switchedcurrent source connected internally between the DRAIN andCONTROL pins.  The current source provides sufficient currentto supply the control circuitry as well as charge the totalexternal capacitance (C\nT).\nThe first time VC reaches the upper threshold, the high-voltage\ncurrent source is turned off and the PWM modulator and outputtransistor are activated, as shown in Figure 5(a).  During normaloperation (when the output voltage is regulated) feedbackcontrol current supplies the V\nC supply current.  The shunt\nregulator keeps VC at typically 5.7 V by shunting CONTROL\npin feedback current exceeding the required DC supply currentthrough the PWM error signal sense resistor R\nE.  The low\ndynamic impedance of this pin (ZC) sets the gain of the error\namplifier when used in a primary feedback  configuration.  Thedynamic impedance of the CONTROL pin together with theexternal resistance and capacitance determines the control loopcompensation of the power system.\nIf the CONTROL pin total external capacitance (C\nT) should\ndischarge to the lower threshold, the output MOSFET is turnedoff and the control circuit is placed in a low-current standbymode.  The high-voltage current source turns on and charges theexternal capacitance again.  Charging current is shown with anegative polarity and discharging current is shown with apositive polarity in Figure 6. The hysteretic auto-restartcomparator keeps V\nC within a window of typically 4.7 to 5.7 V\nby turning the high-voltage current source on and off as shownin Figure 5(b).  The auto-restart circuit has a divide-by-8counter which prevents the output MOSFET from turning onagain until eight discharge-charge cycles have elapsed. Thecounter effectively limits TOPSwitch  power dissipation by\nreducing the auto-restart duty cycle to typically 5%. Auto-restart continues to cycle until output voltage regulation isagain achieved.\nBandgap Reference\nAll critical TOPSwitch  internal voltages are derived from a\ntemperature-compensated bandgap reference.   This referenceis also used to generate a temperature-compensated currentsource which is trimmed to accurately set the oscillator frequencyand MOSFET gate drive current.Oscillator\nThe internal oscillator linearly charges and discharges theinternal capacitance between two voltage levels to create asawtooth waveform for the pulse width modulator.  The oscillatorsets the pulse width modulator/current limit latch at the beginningof each cycle.   The nominal frequency of 100 kHz was chosento minimize EMI and maximize efficiency in power supplyapplications.  Trimming of the current reference improves thefrequency accuracy.\nPulse Width Modulator\nThe pulse width modulator implements a voltage-mode controlloop by driving the output MOSFET with a duty cycle inverselyproportional to the current into the CONTROL pin whichgenerates a voltage error signal across R\nE.  The error signal\nacross RE is filtered by an RC network with a typical corner\nfrequency of 7 kHz to reduce the effect of switching noise.  Thefiltered error signal is compared with the internal oscillatorsawtooth waveform to generate the duty cycle waveform.  Asthe control current increases, the duty cycle decreases.  A clocksignal from the oscillator sets a latch which turns on the outputMOSFET.  The pulse width modulator resets the latch, turningoff the output MOSFET.   The maximum duty cycle is set by thesymmetry of the internal oscillator.  The modulator has aminimum ON-time to keep the current consumption of theTOPSwitch  independent of the error signal.  Note that a minimum\ncurrent must be driven into the CONTROL pin before the dutycycle begins to change.\nGate Driver\nThe gate driver is designed to turn the output MOSFET on at acontrolled rate to minimize common-mode EMI.  The gate drivecurrent is trimmed for improved accuracy.\nError Amplifier\nThe shunt regulator can also perform the function of an erroramplifier in primary feedback applications.  The shunt regulatorvoltage is accurately derived from the temperature compensatedbandgap reference.  The gain of the error amplifier is set by theCONTROL pin dynamic impedance.  The CONTROL pinclamps external circuit signals to the V\nC voltage level.  The\nCONTROL pin current in excess of the supply current isseparated by the shunt regulator and flows through R\nE as a\nvoltage error signal.\nCycle-By-Cycle Current Limit\nThe cycle by cycle peak drain current limit circuit uses theoutput MOSFET ON-resistance as a sense resistor.  A currentlimit comparator compares the output MOSFET ON-state drain-source voltage, V\nDS(ON) with a threshold voltage.  High drain\ncurrent causes VDS(ON) to exceed the threshold voltage and turns\nthe output MOSFET off until the start of the next clock cycle.The current limit comparator threshold voltage is temperatureTOPSwitch-II Family Functional Description (cont.)\nTOP221-227\nD\n7/015PI-2030-042397VIN\nVOUT\n0\nIOUT\n0\n1 2 1 3 1DRAIN\n0VIN\nVC\n0• • ••  • •12 12 81\n0 IC• • ••  • •128\n812 81VC(reset)\ncompensated to minimize variation of the effective peak current\nlimit due to temperature related changes in output MOSFETR\nDS(ON).\nThe leading edge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit\ncomparator for a short time after the output MOSFET is turnedon.  The leading edge blanking time has been set so that currentspikes caused by primary-side capacitances and secondary-siderectifier reverse recovery time will not cause prematuretermination of the switching pulse.\nThe current limit can be lower for a short period after the leading\nedge blanking time as shown in Figure 12.  This is due todynamic characteristics of the MOSFET.  To avoid triggeringthe current limit in normal operation, the drain current waveformshould stay within the envelope shown.\nShutdown/Auto-restart\nTo minimize TOPSwitch  power dissipation, the shutdown/\nauto-restart circuit turns the power supply on and off at an auto-restart duty cycle of typically 5% if an out of regulationcondition persists.  Loss of regulation interrupts the externalcurrent into the CONTROL pin. V\nC regulation changes from\nshunt mode to the hysteretic auto-restart mode described above.When the fault condition is removed, the power supply outputbecomes regulated, V\nC regulation returns to shunt mode, and\nnormal operation of the power supply resumes.\nOvertemperature Protection\nTemperature protection is provided by a precision analogcircuit that turns the output MOSFET off when the junctiontemperature exceeds the thermal shutdown temperature(typically 135 °C).  Activating the power-up reset circuit by\nremoving and restoring input power or momentarily pulling theCONTROL pin below the power-up reset threshold resets thelatch and allows TOPSwitch  to resume normal power supply\noperation.  V\nC is regulated in hysteretic mode and a 4.7 V to\n5.7 V (typical) sawtooth waveform is present on the CONTROLpin when the power supply is latched off.\nHigh-voltage Bias Current Source\nThis current source biases TOPSwitch  from the DRAIN pin and\ncharges the CONTROL pin external capacitance (C\nT) during\nstart-up or hysteretic operation.  Hysteretic operation occursduring auto-restart and overtemperature latched shutdown.The current source is switched on and off with an effective dutycycle of approximately 35%.  This duty cycle is determined bythe ratio of CONTROL pin charge (I\nC) and discharge currents\n(ICD1 and ICD2).  This current source is turned off during normal\noperation when the output MOSFET is switching.Figure 6.

Schematic Diagram of a 4 W TOPSwitch-II Standby Power Supply using an 8 lead PDIP.\nApplication Examples\nFollowing are just two of the many possible TOPSwitch\nimplementations.  Refer to the Data Book and Design Guidefor additional examples.\n4 W Standby Supply using 8 Lead PDIPFigure 7 shows a 4 W standby supply.  This supply is used in\nappliances where certain standby functions (e.g. real timeclock, remote control port) must be kept active even while themain power supply is turned off.\nThe 5 V secondary is used to supply the standby function and\nthe 12 V non-isolated output is used to supply power for thePWM controller of the main power supply and other primaryside functions.\nFor this application the input rectifiers and input filter are sized\nfor the main supply and are not shown.  The input DC rail mayvary from 100 V to 380 V DC which corresponds to the full\nuniversal AC input range. The TOP221 is packaged in an 8 pinpower DIP package.\nThe output voltage (5 V) is directly sensed by the Zener diode\n(VR1) and the optocoupler (U2).  The output voltage is determined\nby the sum of the Zener voltage and the voltage drop across theLED of the optocoupler (the voltage drop across R1 is negligible).The output transistor of the optocoupler drives the CONTROL\npin of the TOP221.    C5 bypasses the CONTROL pin and providescontrol loop compensation and sets the auto-restart frequency.\nThe transformer ’s leakage inductance voltage spikes are snubbed\nby R3 and C1 through diode D1.

Thisexample demonstrates the advantage of the higher power 8 pinleadframe used with the TOPSwitch-II  family.  This low cost\npackage transfers heat directly to the board through six sourcepins, eliminating the heatsink and the associated cost.  Efficiencyis typically 80% at low line input.  Output voltage is directlysensed by optocoupler U2 and Zener diode VR2.  The outputvoltage is determined by the Zener diode (VR2) voltage and thevoltage drops across the optocoupler (U2) LED and resistor R1.Other output voltages are possible by adjusting the transformerturns ratio and value of Zener diode VR2.\nAC power is rectified and filtered by BR1 and C1 to create the\nhigh voltage DC bus applied to the primary winding of T1.

Leakage inductance of L2with C1 and C6 attenuates differential-mode emission currentscaused by the fundamental and harmonics of the trapezoidal ortriangular primary current waveform. C5 filters internalMOSFET gate drive charge current spikes on the CONTROLpin, determines the auto-restart frequency, and together withR1 and R3, compensates the control loop.\nFigure 8.

Use a Kelvin\nconnection to the SOURCE pin for the CONTROL pinbypass capacitor. Use single point grounding techniques atthe SOURCE pin as shown in Figure 9.\n• Minimize peak voltage and ringing on the DRAIN voltage\nat turn-off.  Use a Zener or TVS Zener diode to clamp thedrain voltage below the breakdown voltage rating ofTOPSwitch  under all conditions, including start-up and\noverload.  The maximum recommended clamp Zenervoltage for the TOP2XX series is 200 V and thecorresponding maximum reflected output voltage on theprimary is 135 V.  Please see Step 4: AN-16 in the 1996-97Data Book and Design Guide or on our Web site.\n• The transformer should be designed such that the rate of\nchange of drain current due to transformer saturation iswithin the absolute maximum specification ( ∆I\nD in 100 ns\nbefore turn off as shown in Figure 13).  As a guideline, formost common transformer cores, this can be achieved bymaintaining the Peak Flux Density (at maximum I\nLIMIT\ncurrent) below 4200 Gauss (420 mT).  The transformerspreadsheets Rev. 2.1 (or later) for continuous and Rev.1.0(or later) for discontinuous conduction mode provide thenecessary information.\n• Do not plug TOPSwitch  into a “hot” IC socket during test.\nExternal CONTROL pin capacitance may be charged toexcessive voltage and cause TOPSwitch damage.\n• While performing TOPSwitch  device tests, do not exceed\nmaximum CONTROL pin voltage of 9 V or maximumCONTROL pin current of 100 mA.\n• Under some conditions, externally provided bias or supply\ncurrent driven into the CONTROL pin can hold theTOPSwitch  in one of the 8 auto-restart cycles indefinitely\nand prevent starting.  To avoid this problem when doingbench evaluations, it is recommended that the V\nC power\nsupply be turned on before the DRAIN voltage is applied.TOPSwitch  can also be reset by shorting the CONTROL\npin to the SOURCE pin momentarily.\n• CONTROL pin currents during auto-restart operation are\nmuch lower at low input voltages (< 36 V) which increasesthe auto-restart cycle time (see the I\nC vs. DRAIN Voltage\nCharacteristic curve).• Short interruptions of AC power may cause TOPSwitch  to\nenter the 8-count auto-restart cycle before starting again.This is because the input energy storage capacitors are notcompletely discharged and the CONTROL pin capacitancehas not discharged below the internal power-up resetvoltage.\n• In some cases, minimum loading may be necessary to keep\na lightly loaded or unloaded output voltage within thedesired range due to the minimum ON-time.\nReplacing TOPSwitch   with TOPSwitch-II\nThere is no external latching shutdown function in\nTOPSwitch-II.  Otherwise, the functionality of the\nTOPSwitch-II  devices is same as that of the TOPSwitch  family.\nHowever, before considering TOPSwitch-II  as a \'drop in\'\nreplacement in an existing  TOPSwitch  design, the design\nshould be verified as described below.\nThe new TOPSwitch-II  family offers more power capability\nthan the original TOPSwitch  family for the same MOSFET\nR\nDS(ON).  Therefore, the original TOPSwitch  design must be\nreviewed to make sure that the selected TOPSwitch-II\nreplacement device and other primary components are not overstressed under abnormal conditions.\nThe following verification steps are recommended:\n•  Check the transformer design to make sure that it meets the\n∆I\nD specification as outlined in the General Guidelines\nsection above.\n• Thermal:  Higher power capability of the TOPSwitch-II\nwould in many instances allow use of a smaller MOSFETdevice (higher R\nDS(ON)) for reduced cost.  This may affect\nTOPSwitch  power dissipation and power supply efficiency.\nTherefore thermal performance of the power supply mustbe verified with the selected TOPSwitch-II device .\n• Clamp Voltage: Reflected and Clamp voltages should be\nverified not to exceed recommended maximums for theTOP2XX Series: 135 V Reflected/200 V Clamp.  Pleasesee Step 4: AN-16 in the Data Book and Design Guide andreadme.txt file attached to the transformer designspreadsheets.\n• Agency Approval: Migrating to TOPSwitch-II  may require\nagency re-approval.\nTOP221-227\nD\n7/019Figure 9.

The breakdown voltage and leakage current measurements can be accomplished as shown in Figure 15  by using\nthe following sequence:\ni.   The curve tracer should initially be set at 0 V.  The base output should be adjusted through a voltage sequence\n      of 0 V, 6.5 V, 4.3 V, and 6.5 V, as shown.  The base current from the curve tracer should not exceed 100 mA.  This      CONTROL pin sequence interrupts the Auto-restart sequence and locks the TOPSwitch  internal MOSFET in the\n     OFF State.ii.  The breakdown and the leakage measurements can now be taken with the curve tracer.  The maximum     voltage from the curve tracer must be limited to 700 V under all conditions.\nC. It is possible to start up and operate TOPSwitch  at DRAIN voltages well below 36 V.  However, the CONTROL pin\ncharging current is reduced, which affects start-up time, auto-restart frequency, and auto-restart duty cycle.

It is recommended that the V\nC power supply be\nturned on first and the DRAIN power supply second if continuousdrain voltage waveforms are to be observed.  The 12.5% chanceof being in the correct state is due to the 8:1 counter.
