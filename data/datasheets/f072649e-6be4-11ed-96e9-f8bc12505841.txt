Rev. 1.4  |  7\n3.2  Power\nAll internal circuitry draws power from the VDD supply pin. External I/O pins are powered from the VIO supply voltage (or VDD on devi-\nces without a separate VIO connection), while most of the internal circuitry is supplied by an on-chip LDO regulator. Control over the\ndevice power can be achieved by enabling/disabling individual peripherals as needed. Each analog peripheral can be disabled when\nnot in use and placed in low power mode. Digital peripherals, such as timers and serial buses, have their clocks gated off and draw little\npower when they are not in use.\nTable 3.1.

Port pins P0.0-P2.3 can be defined as gen-\neral-purpose I/O (GPIO), assigned to one of the internal digital resources through the crossbar or dedicated channels, or assigned to an\nanalog function. Port pins P3.0 and P3.1 can be used as GPIO. Additionally, the C2 Interface Data signal (C2D) is shared with P3.0.\nThe port control block offers the following features:\n• Up to 22 multi-functions I/O pins, supporting digital and analog functions.\n• Flexible priority crossbar decoder for digital peripheral assignment.\n• Two drive strength settings for each port.\n• Two direct-pin interrupt sources with dedicated interrupt vectors (INT0 and INT1).\n• Up to 20 direct-pin interrupt sources with shared interrupt vector (Port Match).EFM8BB2 Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.4  |  8\n3.4  Clocking\nThe CPU core and peripheral subsystem may be clocked by both internal and external oscillator resources. By default, the system\nclock comes up running from the 24.5 MHz oscillator divided by 8.\nThe clock control system offers the following features:\n• Provides clock to core and peripherals.\n• 24.5 MHz internal oscillator (HFOSC0), accurate to ±2% over supply and temperature corners.\n• 49 MHz internal oscillator (HFOSC1), accurate to ±1.5% over supply and temperature corners.\n• 80 kHz low-frequency oscillator (LFOSC0).\n• External CMOS clock input (EXTCLK).\n• Clock divider with eight settings for flexible clock scaling:\n• Divide the selected clock source by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128.\n• HFOSC0 and HFOSC1 include 1.5x pre-scalers for further flexibility.\n3.5  Counters/Timers and PWM\nProgrammable Counter Array (PCA0)\nThe programmable counter array (PCA) provides multiple channels of enhanced timer and PWM functionality while requiring less CPU\nintervention than standard counter/timers. The PCA consists of a dedicated 16-bit counter/timer and one 16-bit capture/compare mod-\nule for each channel. The counter/timer is driven by a programmable timebase that has flexible external and internal clocking options.\nEach capture/compare module may be configured to operate independently in one of five modes: Edge-Triggered Capture, Software\nTimer, High-Speed Output, Frequency Output, or Pulse-Width Modulated (PWM) Output. Each capture/compare module has its own\nassociated I/O line (CEXn) which is routed through the crossbar to port I/O when enabled.\n• 16-bit time base\n• Programmable clock divisor and clock source selection\n• Up to three independently-configurable channels\n• 8, 9, 10, 11 and 16-bit PWM modes (center or edge-aligned operation)\n• Output polarity control\n• Frequency output mode\n• Capture on rising, falling or any edge\n• Compare function for arbitrary waveform generation\n• Software timer (internal compare) mode\n• Can accept hardware “kill” signal from comparator 0EFM8BB2 Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.4  |  9\nTimers (Timer 0, Timer 1, Timer 2, Timer 3, and Timer 4)\nSeveral counter/timers are included in the device: two are 16-bit counter/timers compatible with those found in the standard 8051, and\nthe rest are 16-bit auto-reload timers for timing peripherals or for general purpose use. These timers can be used to measure time inter-\nvals, count external events and generate periodic interrupt requests. Timer 0 and Timer 1 are nearly identical and have four primary\nmodes of operation. The other timers offer both 16-bit and split 8-bit timer functionality with auto-reload and capture capabilities.\nTimer 0 and Timer 1 include the following features:\n• Standard 8051 timers, supporting backwards-compatibility with firmware and hardware.\n• Clock sources include SYSCLK, SYSCLK divided by 12, 4, or 48, the External Clock divided by 8, or an external pin.\n• 8-bit auto-reload counter/timer mode\n• 13-bit counter/timer mode\n• 16-bit counter/timer mode\n• Dual 8-bit counter/timer mode (Timer 0)\nTimer 2, Timer 3 and Timer 4 are 16-bit timers including the following features:\n• Clock sources for all timers include SYSCLK, SYSCLK divided by 12, or the External Clock divided by 8.\n• LFOSC0 divided by 8 may be used to clock Timer 3 and Timer 4 in active or suspend/snooze power modes.\n• Timer 4 is a low-power wake source, and can be chained together with Timer 3\n• 16-bit auto-reload timer mode\n• Dual 8-bit auto-reload timer mode\n• External pin capture\n• LFOSC0 capture\n• Comparator 0 capture\nWatchdog Timer (WDT0)\nThe device includes a programmable watchdog timer (WDT) running off the low-frequency oscillator. A WDT overflow forces the MCU\ninto the reset state. To prevent the reset, the WDT must be restarted by application software before overflow. If the system experiences\na software or hardware malfunction preventing the software from restarting the WDT, the WDT overflows and causes a reset. Following\na reset, the WDT is automatically enabled and running with the default maximum time interval. If needed, the WDT can be disabled by\nsystem software or locked on to prevent accidental disabling. Once locked, the WDT cannot be disabled until the next system reset.\nThe state of the RST pin is unaffected by this reset.\nThe Watchdog Timer has the following features:\n• Programmable timeout interval\n• Runs from the low-frequency oscillator\n• Lock-out feature to prevent any modification until a system reset\n3.6  Communications and Other Digital Peripherals\nUniversal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART0)\nUART0 is an asynchronous, full duplex serial port offering modes 1 and 3 of the standard 8051 UART. Enhanced baud rate support\nallows a wide range of clock sources to generate standard baud rates. Received data buffering allows UART0 to start reception of a\nsecond incoming data byte before software has finished reading the previous data byte.\nThe UART module provides the following features:\n• Asynchronous transmissions and receptions.\n• Baud rates up to SYSCLK/2 (transmit) or SYSCLK/8 (receive).\n• 8- or 9-bit data.\n• Automatic start and stop generation.\n• Single-byte FIFO on transmit and receive.EFM8BB2 Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.4  |  10\nUniversal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART1)\nUART1 is an asynchronous, full duplex serial port offering a variety of data formatting options. A dedicated baud rate generator with a\n16-bit timer and selectable prescaler is included, which can generate a wide range of baud rates. A received data FIFO allows UART1\nto receive multiple bytes before data is lost and an overflow occurs.\nUART1 provides the following features:\n• Asynchronous transmissions and receptions.\n• Dedicated baud rate generator supports baud rates up to SYSCLK/2 (transmit) or SYSCLK/8 (receive).\n• 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 bit data.\n• Automatic start and stop generation.\n• Automatic parity generation and checking.\n• Four byte FIFO on transmit and receive.\n• Auto-baud detection.\n• LIN break and sync field detection.\n• CTS / RTS hardware flow control.\nSerial Peripheral Interface (SPI0)\nThe serial peripheral interface (SPI) module provides access to a flexible, full-duplex synchronous serial bus. The SPI can operate as a\nmaster or slave device in both 3-wire or 4-wire modes, and supports multiple masters and slaves on a single SPI bus. The slave-select\n(NSS) signal can be configured as an input to select the SPI in slave mode, or to disable master mode operation in a multi-master\nenvironment, avoiding contention on the SPI bus when more than one master attempts simultaneous data transfers. NSS can also be\nconfigured as a firmware-controlled chip-select output in master mode, or disabled to reduce the number of pins required. Additional\ngeneral purpose port I/O pins can be used to select multiple slave devices in master mode.\n• Supports 3- or 4-wire master or slave modes.\n• Supports external clock frequencies up to 12 Mbps in master or slave mode.\n• Support for all clock phase and polarity modes.\n• 8-bit programmable clock rate (master).\n• Programmable receive timeout (slave).\n• Four byte FIFO on transmit and receive.\n• Can operate in suspend or snooze modes and wake the CPU on reception of a byte.\n• Support for multiple masters on the same data lines.\nSystem Management Bus / I2C (SMB0)\nThe SMBus I/O interface is a two-wire, bi-directional serial bus. The SMBus is compliant with the System Management Bus Specifica-\ntion, version 1.1, and compatible with the I2C serial bus.\nThe SMBus module includes the following features:\n• Standard (up to 100 kbps) and Fast (400 kbps) transfer speeds\n• Support for master, slave, and multi-master modes\n• Hardware synchronization and arbitration for multi-master mode\n• Clock low extending (clock stretching) to interface with faster masters\n• Hardware support for 7-bit slave and general call address recognition\n• Firmware support for 10-bit slave address decoding\n• Ability to inhibit all slave states\n• Programmable data setup/hold times\n• Transmit and receive FIFOs (one byte) to help increase throughput in faster applicationsEFM8BB2 Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.4  |  11\nI2C Slave (I2CSLAVE0)\nThe I2C Slave interface is a 2-wire, bidirectional serial bus that is compatible with the I2C Bus Specification 3.0. It is capable of transfer-\nring in high-speed mode (HS-mode) at speeds of up to 3.4 Mbps. Firmware can write to the I2C interface, and the I2C interface can\nautonomously control the serial transfer of data. The interface also supports clock stretching for cases where the core may be tempora-\nrily prohibited from transmitting a byte or processing a received byte during an I2C transaction. This module operates only as an I2C\nslave device.\nThe I2C module includes the following features:\n• Standard (up to 100 kbps), Fast (400 kbps), Fast Plus (1 Mbps), and High-speed (3.4 Mbps) transfer speeds\n• Support for slave mode only\n• Clock low extending (clock stretching) to interface with faster masters\n• Hardware support for 7-bit slave address recognition\n• Transmit and receive FIFOs (two bytes) to help increase throughput in faster applications\n16-bit CRC (CRC0)\nThe cyclic redundancy check (CRC) module performs a CRC using a 16-bit polynomial. CRC0 accepts a stream of 8-bit data and posts\nthe 16-bit result to an internal register. In addition to using the CRC block for data manipulation, hardware can automatically CRC the\nflash contents of the device.\nThe CRC module is designed to provide hardware calculations for flash memory verification and communications protocols. The CRC\nmodule supports the standard CCITT-16 16-bit polynomial (0x1021), and includes the following features:\n• Support for CCITT-16 polynomial\n• Byte-level bit reversal\n• Automatic CRC of flash contents on one or more 256-byte blocks\n• Initial seed selection of 0x0000 or 0xFFFF\n3.7  Analog\n12-Bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC0)\nThe ADC is a successive-approximation-register (SAR) ADC with 12-, 10-, and 8-bit modes, integrated track-and hold and a program-\nmable window detector. The ADC is fully configurable under software control via several registers. The ADC may be configured to\nmeasure different signals using the analog multiplexer. The voltage reference for the ADC is selectable between internal and external\nreference sources.\n• Up to 20 external inputs.\n• Single-ended 12-bit and 10-bit modes.\n• Supports an output update rate of 200 ksps samples per second in 12-bit mode or 800 ksps samples per second in 10-bit mode.\n• Operation in low power modes at lower conversion speeds.\n• Asynchronous hardware conversion trigger, selectable between software, external I/O and internal timer sources.\n• Output data window comparator allows automatic range checking.\n•Support for burst mode, which produces one set of accumulated data per conversion-start trigger with programmable power-on set-\ntling and tracking time.\n• Conversion complete and window compare interrupts supported.\n• Flexible output data formatting.\n• Includes an internal fast-settling reference with two levels (1.65 V and 2.4 V) and support for external reference and signal ground.\n• Integrated temperature sensor.EFM8BB2 Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.4  |  12\nLow Current Comparators (CMP0, CMP1)\nAnalog comparators are used to compare the voltage of two analog inputs, with a digital output indicating which input voltage is higher.\nExternal input connections to device I/O pins and internal connections are available through separate multiplexers on the positive and\nnegative inputs. Hysteresis, response time, and current consumption may be programmed to suit the specific needs of the application.\nThe comparator includes the following features:\n• Up to 10 (CMP0) or 12 (CMP1) external positive inputs\n• Up to 10 (CMP0) or 12 (CMP1) external negative inputs\n• Additional input options:\n• Internal connection to LDO output\n• Direct connection to GND\n• Direct connection to VDD\n• Dedicated 6-bit reference DAC\n• Synchronous and asynchronous outputs can be routed to pins via crossbar\n• Programmable hysteresis between 0 and ±20 mV\n• Programmable response time\n• Interrupts generated on rising, falling, or both edges\n• PWM output kill feature\n3.8  Reset Sources\nReset circuitry allows the controller to be easily placed in a predefined default condition. On entry to this reset state, the following occur:\n• The core halts program execution.\n• Module registers are initialized to their defined reset values unless the bits reset only with a power-on reset.\n• External port pins are forced to a known state.\n• Interrupts and timers are disabled.\nAll registers are reset to the predefined values noted in the register descriptions unless the bits only reset with a power-on reset. The\ncontents of RAM are unaffected during a reset; any previously stored data is preserved as long as power is not lost. The Port I/O latch-\nes are reset to 1 in open-drain mode. Weak pullups are enabled during and after the reset. For Supply Monitor and power-on resets,\nthe RSTb pin is driven low until the device exits the reset state. On exit from the reset state, the program counter (PC) is reset, and the\nsystem clock defaults to an internal oscillator. The Watchdog Timer is enabled, and program execution begins at location 0x0000.\nReset sources on the device include the following:\n• Power-on reset\n• External reset pin\n• Comparator reset\n• Software-triggered reset\n• Supply monitor reset (monitors VDD supply)\n• Watchdog timer reset\n• Missing clock detector reset\n• Flash error reset\n3.9  Debugging\nThe EFM8BB2  devices include an on-chip Silicon Labs 2-Wire (C2) debug interface to allow flash programming and in-system debug-\nging with the production part installed in the end application. The C2 interface uses a clock signal (C2CK) and a bi-directional C2 data\nsignal (C2D) to transfer information between the device and a host system. See the C2 Interface Specification for details on the C2\nprotocol.EFM8BB2 Data Sheet\nSystem Overview\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.4  |  13\n3.10  Bootloader\nAll devices come pre-programmed with a UART bootloader. This bootloader resides in the code security page and last page of code\nflash; it can be erased if it is not needed.\nThe byte before the Lock Byte is the Bootloader Signature Byte. Setting this byte to a value of 0xA5 indicates the presence of the boot-\nloader in the system. Any other value in this location indicates that the bootloader is not present in flash.\nWhen a bootloader is present, the device will jump to the bootloader vector after any reset, allowing the bootloader to run. The boot-\nloader then determines if the device should stay in bootload mode or jump to the reset vector located at 0x0000. When the bootloader\nis not present, the device will jump to the reset vector of 0x0000 after any reset.\nMore information about the bootloader protocol and usage can be found in AN945: EFM8 Factory Bootloader User Guide . Application\nnotes can be found on the Silicon Labs website ( www.silabs.com/8bit-appnotes ) or within Simplicity Studio by using the [Application\nNotes ] tile.\n0x00000x3FFF0x40000xF7FF0xF8000xFBBF0xFBC00xFFC00xFFFF\n0xFC000xFFBF\n16 KB Code\n(32 x 512 Byte pages)ReservedNonvolatile DataCode Security Page\n64 BytesRead-Only\nReserved\nBootloader Vector\nReset VectorBootloader Bootloader0xFBFE0xFBFF Lock Byte\nBootloader Signature Byte\nFigure 3.2.

Rev. 1.4  |  33\n5.2  Debug\nThe diagram below shows a typical connection diagram for the debug connections pins. The pin sharing resistors are only required if\nthe functionality on the C2D (a GPIO pin) and the C2CK (RSTb) is routed to external circuitry. For example, if the RSTb pin is connec-\nted to an external switch with debouncing filter or if the GPIO sharing with the C2D pin is connected to an external circuit, the pin shar-\ning resistors and connections to the debug adapter must be placed on the hardware. Otherwise, these components and connections\ncan be omitted.\nFor more information on debug connections, see the example schematics and information available in AN124: Pin Sharing Techniques\nfor the C2 Interface .
