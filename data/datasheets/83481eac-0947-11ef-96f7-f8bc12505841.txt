Failure Judgment Criterion: Ba sic Specification, Elect rical Characteristic, Mechanical  \n \nCharacteristic, Optical Characteristic. \n \n \n7. Suggestions for using LCD modules  \n \n7.1 The display panel is made of glass and polarizer. As glass is fragile. It tends to become or \nchipped during handling especially on the edge s. Please avoid dropping or jarring. Do not \nsubject it to a mechanical s hock by dropping it or impact. \n \n \n7.2 If the display panel is damaged and the liquid crys tal substance leaks out, be  sure not to get any \nin your mouth. If the substance contacts your skin or clothes, wash it off using soap and water. \n \n \n7.3 Do not apply excessive force to the display surfa ce or the adjoining areas  since this may cause \nthe color tone to vary. Do not touch the display w ith bare hands. This will stain the display area \nand degraded insulation between terminals (some cosmetics are determined to the polarizer). \n \n \n7.4 The polarizer covering the display surface of the LCD module is soft and easily \nscratched.Handle this polarizer carefully. Do not touch, push or rub the exposed\npolarizers \nwith anything harder than an HB pencil lead (glass, tweezers, etc.). Do not put or attach \nanything on the display area to avoid leav ing marks on it. Condensation on the surface \nand contact with terminals due to cold will damage, stain or dirty the polarizer. After \nproducts are tested at low temperature they must be warmed up in a container before \ncoming in to contact with  room temperature air. \n \n7.5 If the display surface becomes c ontaminated, breathe on  the surface and gent ly wipe it with a \nsoft dry cloth. If it is heavily contaminated, mo isten cloth with one of the following solvents \n \n- Isopropyl alcohol \n \n- Ethyl alcohol \n \nDo not scrub hard to avoid damaging the display surface.\n \n \n7.6 Solvents other than those above-mentioned may damage the polarizer. Especially, do not use the \nfollowing. \n \n\n \n \n  \n \n                         P a g e  1 1  o f  1 3   - Water \n \n- Ketone \n \n- Aromatic solvents \n \nWipe off saliva or water drops immediately, contact with water over a long period of time may \ncause deformation or color fading. Avoid contact  with oil and fats.7.7 Exercise care to minimize \ncorrosion of the electrode. Corrosion of the electr odes is accelerated by water droplets, moisture \ncondensation or a current flow in a high-humidity  environment.\n \n \n \n7.8 Install the LCD Module by us ing the mounting holes. When mounting the LCD module make \nsure it is free of twisting, warp ing and distortion. In particular, do not forcibly pull or bend the I  \nO cable or the backlight cable. \n \n7.9 Do not attempt to disassemble  or process the LCD module. \n \n7.10 NC terminal should be ope n. Do not connect anything. \n \n7.11 If the logic circuit power is off, do not apply the input signals. \n \n7.12 Electro-Static Discharge Control ，Since this module uses a CMOS LSI, the same careful \nattention should be paid to elect rostatic discharge as for an ordinary CMOS IC. To prevent \ndestruction of the elements by static electrici ty, be careful to maintain an optimum work \nenvironment. \n \n- Before removing LCM from its packing case or incorporating it into a set, be sure the \n \nmodule and your body have the same electric potential. Be sure to ground the body \n \nwhen handling the LCD modules. \n \n- Tools required for assembli ng, such as soldering irons, mu st be properly grounded.Make \ncertain the AC power source fo r the soldering iron does not l eak. When using an electric \nscrewdriver to attach LCM, th e screwdriver should be of gr ound potentiality to minimize as \nmuch as possible any transmission ofelectr omagnetic waves produced sparks coming from \nthe commutator of the motor.  \n \n- To reduce the amount of static electricity ge nerated, do not conduct asse mbling and other work \nunder dry conditions. To reduce the genera tion of static electric ity be careful that th e air in the work is \nnot too dry. A relative humidity of 50%-60% is r ecommended. As far as possible make the electric \npotential of your work cl othes and that of the wo rk bench the ground potential.\n \n \n- The LCD module is coated with a film to protect the display surface. Exercise care when peeling off \nthis protective film since static electricity may be generated.\n \n\n \n \n  \n \n                         P a g e  1 2  o f  1 3   7.13 Since LCM has been assembled and adjusted with a high degree of precision, avoid applying \nexcessive shocks to the module or making any alterations or modifications to it. \n \n- Do not alter, modify or change the shape of the tab on the metal frame. -  \n \n- Do not make extra holes on the printed circuit boa rd, modify its shape or change the positions of \ncomponents to be attached. \n \n \n- Do not damage or modify the pattern  writing on the prin ted circuit board. - \n \n- Absolutely do not modify the zebra rubber stri p (conductive rubber) or h eat seal connector. \n \n \n \n- Except for soldering the interface, do not make a ny alterations or modifica tions with a soldering \niron.\n \n \n \n- Do not drop, bend or twist the LCM. \n \n8.Storage Method  \n \n8.2.1.Store in an ambient temperature of 23°C±5°C,  and in a relative humidity of 55%±15%. Don\'t \nexceed 12 months and expose to sunlight or fluorescent light.\n \n \n8.2.2.Store in a clean environment, free from dust, active ga s, and solvent. \n \n8.2.3  LCM module is stored in warehouse ，Store in antistatic container ， There may be air bubbles \nbetween the protective film on the su rface of polarizer and polarizer 。 It can only be found under LED \nlight， Before production ，IQC should be inspected directly by LED light ，If residual tr aces are found, \nalcohol should be used to wipe them 。 \n \n \n\n \n \n  \n \n      \n                   P a g e  1 3  o f  1 3  \n \n9.Packing and Storage Specification(Reference Only) \n \n9.1 Packing Method  \n \n(1)\n \n(2) \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3)\n \n(4) \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(5)\n \n(6) \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.
