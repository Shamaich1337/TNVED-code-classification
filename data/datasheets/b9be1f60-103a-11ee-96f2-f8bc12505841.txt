The device contains an 8 x 3-bit serial-IN, paralle l-OUT shift register that \nfeeds a 8 x 3-bit D-type storage register. In the output stage, twenty four regulated current sources were designed to provide 5-80 mA constant current to drive the LEDs.\nThe 8 x 3 shift register data flow sequence order \ncan be managed through two dedicated pins.\nThe STP24DP05 has a dedicated pin to activate \nthe outputs with a sequential delay, that prevents inrush current during output turn-ON.\nThe device detection circuit checks 3 different \nconditions that can occur on the output line: short to GND, short to V\nO, or open line. \nThe data detection results are loaded in the shift \nregisters and shifted out via the serial line output.The detection functionality is activated with a \ndedicated pin or alternatively, through a logic sequence that allows the user to enter or exit detection mode.\nThrough three external resistors, the user can \nadjust the output current for each 8-channel group, therefore contro lling the light intensity \nof LEDs.\nThe STP24DP05 guarantees a 20 V output \ndriving capability, allowing the user to connect more LEDs in series. \nThe high clock frequency, 25 MHz, makes the \ndevice suitable for high data rate transmission.\nThe 3.3 V of voltage supply is useful for \napplications that interface any microcontroller from 3.3 V.TQFP48-EP\nTable 1.

The data are latched by LE\\DM and after that the outputs are ready for the detection process. When the microcontroller switches the OE-R\\DM\n to LOW, the device drives the LEDs in \norder to analyze if an OPEN or SHORT condition has occurred.\nThe LED status is detected after at least 1 microsecond and after this time the \nmicrocontroller sets OE-R\\DM  in HIGH state and the output data detection result goes to the \nmicroprocessor via the SDO pin.\nDetection mode and normal mode both use the same format data. As soon as all the \ndetection data bits are available on the serial line, the device may go back to normal operation mode. The result of the error detection is shifted out of the SDO pin providing 24 clock pulses. A faulty output is indicated as “0”, whereas a good output is indicated as “1”.\nThe result is shifted out according to the selected data flow (DF0 and DF1 status, see \nSection 7.6 ).Figure 14.
