The MAX3051 \nis primarily intended for +3.3V single-supply applications \nthat do not require the stringent fault protection specified \nby the automotive industry (ISO 11898).\nThe MAX3051 features four different modes of opera -\ntion: high-speed, slope-control, standby, and shutdown \nmode. High-speed mode allows data rates up to 1Mbps. \nThe slope-control mode can be used to program the slew \nrate of the transmitter for data rates of up to 500kbps. \nThis reduces the effects of EMI, thus allowing the use \nof unshielded twisted or parallel cable. In standby mode, \nthe transmitter is shut off and the receiver is pulled high, \nplacing the MAX3051 in low-current mode. In shutdown \nmode, the transmitter and receiver are switched off.\nThe MAX3051 input common-mode range is from -7V to \n+12V, exceeding the ISO 11898 specification of -2V to \n+7V. These features, and the programmable slew-rate \nlimiting, make the part ideal for nonautomotive, harsh \nenvironments.

It is \nprimarily intended for +3.3V single-supply applications \nthat do not require the stringent fault protection specified \nby the automotive industry (ISO 11898).\nThe MAX3051 features four different modes of opera -\ntion: high-speed, slope-control, standby, and shutdown \nmode. High-speed mode allows data rates up to 1Mbps. \nThe slope-control mode can be used to program the slew \nrate of the transmitter for data rates of up to 500kbps. \nThis reduces the effects of EMI, thus allowing the use \nof unshielded twisted or parallel cable. In standby mode, \nthe transmitter is shut off and the receiver is pulled high, \nplacing the MAX3051 in low-current mode. In shutdown \nmode, the transmitter and receiver are switched off. \nThe MAX3051 input common-mode range is from -7V to \n+12V, exceeding the ISO 11898 specification of -2V to \n+7V. These features, and the programmable slew-rate \nlimiting, make the part ideal for nonautomotive, harsh \nenvironments.\nThe transceivers operate from a single +3.3V supply and \ndraw 35μA of supply current in dominant state and 2μA \nin recessive state. In standby mode, supply current is \nreduced to 8μA. In shutdown mode, supply current is less \nthan 1μA.\nCANH and CANL are output short-circuit current limited \nand are protected against excessive power dissipation by \nthermal-shutdown circuitry that places the driver outputs \ninto a high-impedance state.\nTransmitter\nThe transmitter converts a single-ended input (TXD) from \nthe CAN controller to differential outputs for the bus lines \n(CANH, CANL). The truth table for the transmitter and \nreceiver is given in Table 1 .Receiver\nThe receiver reads differential inputs from the bus lines \n(CANH, CANL) and transfers this data as a single-ended \noutput (RXD) to the CAN controller. It consists of a  \ncomparator that senses the difference V DIFF = (CANH - \nCANL) with respect to an internal threshold of +0.75V. If \nthis V DIFF is greater than 0.75, a logic-low is present at \nRXD. If V DIFF is less than 0.75V, a logic-high is present. \nThe receiver always echoes the CAN BUS data.\nThe CANH and CANL common-mode range is -7V to \n+12V. RXD is logic-high when CANH and CANL are \nshorted or terminated and undriven.\nMode Selection\nHigh-Speed Mode\nConnect RS to ground to set the MAX3051 to high -\nspeed mode. When operating in high-speed mode, the \nMAX3051 can achieve transmission rates of up to 1Mbps. \nIn high-speed mode, use shielded twisted pair cable to \navoid EMI problems.\nSlope-Control Mode\nConnect a resistor from RS to ground to select slope -\ncontrol mode ( Table 2 ). In slope-control mode, CANH \nand CANL slew rates are controlled by the resistor con -\nnected to the RS pin. Maximum transmission speeds are \ncontrolled by RRS and range from 40kbps to 500kbps. \nControlling the rise and fall slopes reduces EMI and \nallows the use of an unshielded twisted pair or a parallel \npair of wires as bus lines. The equation for selecting the \nresistor value is given by:\nRRS (kΩ) ≈ 12000 / (maximum speed in kbps)\nSee the Slew Rate vs. RRS graph in the Typical Operating \nCharacteristics .\nStandby Mode\nIf a logic-high is applied to RS, the MAX3051 enters a \nlow-current standby mode. In this mode, the transmitter\nTable 1.

If dominant bits are detected, \nRXD switches to low level. The microcontroller should \nreact to this condition by switching the transceiver back \nto normal operation.\nWhen the MAX3051 enters standby mode, RXD \ngoes high for 4μs (max) regardless of the BUS state. \nHowever, after 4μs, RXD goes low only when the BUS is  \ndominant, otherwise RXD remains high (when the BUS \nis recessive). For proper measurement of standby-to-  \nreceiver active time (t SBRXDL ), the BUS should be in \ndominant state (see Figure 2 ).\nShutdown\nDrive SHDN high to enter shutdown mode. Connect \nSHDN to ground or leave unconnected for normal  \noperation.\nThermal Shutdown\nIf the junction temperature exceeds +160°C, the device \nis switched off. The hysteresis is approximately 25°C, \ndisabling thermal shutdown once the temperature drops \nbelow 135°C. In thermal shutdown, CANH and CANL go \nrecessive and all IC functions are disabled.Applications Information\nReduced EMI and Reflections\nIn slope-control mode, the CANH and CANL outputs are \nslew-rate limited, minimizing EMI and reducing reflections \ncaused by improperly terminated cables.\nIn multidrop CAN applications, it is important to maintain a \ndirect point-to-point wiring scheme. A single pair of wires \nshould connect each element of the CAN bus, and the two \nends of the bus should be terminated with 120Ω resistors  \n(Figure 6 ). A star configuration should never be used.\nAny deviation from the point-to-point wiring scheme cre -\nates a stub. The high-speed edge of the CAN data on \na stub can create reflections back down the bus. These \nreflections can cause data errors by eroding the noise \nmargin of the system.\nAlthough stubs are unavoidable in a multidrop system, \ncare should be taken to keep these stubs as small as \npossible, especially in high-speed mode. In slope-control \nmode, the requirements are not as rigorous, but stub \nlength should still be minimized.\nPower Supply and Bypassing\nThe MAX3051 requires no special layout considerations \nbeyond common practices. Bypass V CC to GND with a \n0.1μF ceramic capacitor mounted close to the IC with \nshort lead lengths and wide trace widths.\nTable 2.
