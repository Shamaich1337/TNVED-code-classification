Product Characteristic data  \n \n2-1. Capacitance  \n \nThe capacitance  is the ratio of the change  in an electric charge according to voltage change.  \nDue to the fact that the capacitance may be subject to change with the measured voltage and \nfrequency, it is highly recommended to measure the capacitance based on the following \nconditions.  \n  \n2-1-1. Measure capacitance with voltage and frequency specified in this document.  \nRegarding the voltage/frequency condition for capacitance measurement  of each MLCC model,  \nplease make sure to follow  a section “ C. Reliability test Condition  - Capacitance ” in this document.  \n \nThe following table shows the voltage and frequency condition according to the capacitance  \nrange.  \n \n[The vo ltage and frequency condition according to MLCC the capacitance  range] \n◆ Class I  \nCapacitance  Frequency  Voltage  \n≤ 1,000 pF  1 MHz ± 10% \n0.5 ~ 5 Vrms  \n> 1,000 pF  1 kHz ± 10% \n \n◆ Class II  \nCapacitance  Frequency  Voltage  \n≤ 10 ㎌ 1 kHz ± 10% 1.0 ± 0.2 Vrms  \n> 10 ㎌ 120 Hz ± 20% 0.5 ± 0.1 Vrms  \nException*  1 kHz ± 10% 0.5 ± 0.1 Vrms  \nCapacitance shall be measured after the heat treatment of 150+0/ -10℃ \nfor 1hr, leaving at room temperature for 24 ±2hr. (Class II)  \n \n2-1-2. It is recommended to use measurement equipment with the ALC (Auto Level Control) option.  \n      The reason is that when capacitance or measurement frequency is high, the output voltage of \n      measurement equipment  can be lower than the setting voltage due to the  equipment limitation . \n      Note that when capacitance or measurement frequency is excessively high, the measurement  \n      equipment may show ALC off warning and provide a lower output voltage than the setting  \n      voltage even with ALC option sele cted. It is necessary to ensure the output voltage  of \n      measurement equipment is the same as the setting voltage before measuring capacitance.  \n \n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-1-3. Capacitance value of high dielectric constant (Class II) MLCC changes with applied AC and DC  \n      voltage. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account MLCC’s AC voltage characteristics and DC - \n      bias voltage characteristics when applying MLCC to the actual circuit.  \n \n2-1-4. The capacitance is in compliance with the EIA RS -198-1-F-2002. \n \n \n2-2. Tan δ  (DF) \n \n2-2-1. An ideal MLCC’s energy loss is zero, but real MLCC has dielectric loss and resistance loss of \nelectrode. DF (Dissipation Factor) is defined as the ratio of loss energy to stored energy and \ntypically being calculated as percentage.  \n \n2-2-2. Quality factor (Q factor) is defined as the ratio of stored energy to loss energy.   \n      The equation can be described as 1/DF.  Normally the loss characteristic of Class I MLCC i s  \n      presented  in Q, since the DF value is so small whereas the loss ch aracteristic of Class II MLCC is  \n      presented  in DF. \n \n2-2-3. It is recommended to use Class I MLCC for applications to require good linearity and low loss   \nsuch as coupling circuit, filter circuit and time constant circuit.  \n \n \n2-3. Insulation Resistanc e \n \nCeramic dielectric has a low leakage current with DC voltage due to  the high insulating properties.  \nInsulation resistance is defined as the ratio of  a leakage current to DC voltage.  \n \n2-3-1. When applying DC voltage to MLCC, a charging current and a leakage current flow together at \nthe initial stage of measurement. While the c harging current decreases , and insulation resistance \n(IR) in MLCC is saturate d by time. Therefore, insulation resistance shall be measured 1 minute after \napplying the rated volta ge. \n \n \n2-4. Capacitance Aging \n \nThe aging characteristic is that the high dielectric (Class II) MLCC decreases capacitance  \nvalue over time.  It is also necessary to consider the aging characteristic with voltage and  \ntemperature characteristics when Class II MLCC is used in circuitry . \n \n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-4-1. In general, aging causes  capacitance to decrease linearly with the log of time as shown in the  \n      following graph.  Please check with SEMCO for more detai ls, since the value may vary between  \n      different models.  \n \n2-4-2. After heat treatment (150 °C, 1hour), the capacitance decreased by aging is recovered, so aging \nshould be considered again from the time of heat treatment.  \n \n[ Example of Capacitance Aging ]  \n* Sample : C0G, X7R (X7S), X5R \n \n \n2-5. Temperature Characteristics of Capacitance (TCC)  \n \nPlease consider temperature characteristics of capacitance since the electrica l characteristics such as \ncapacitance changes  which is caused by a change in ceramic dielectric constant  by temperature.  \n \n2-5-1. It is necessary to check the values specified in section “ C. Reliability test Condition –Temperature  \nCharacteristics” for the temperature and capacitance change range of MLCC.  \n \n   \n[ Example of Temperature Characteristics (X5R) ]             [ Example  of Bias TCC ]  \n* Sample : 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V       * Sample : 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-5-2. When selecting MLCC, it is necessary to consider the heat characteristics of a system, room  \n      temperature and TCC of MLCC , since the applied temperature  may change the capacitance of  \n      MLCC. \n \n2-5-3. In add ition, Bias TCC of MLCC  should be taken into account when DC voltage is appl ied to MLCC.  \n \n \n2-6. Self-heating Temperature  \n \nIt is necessary to design the system, with considering self-heating generated  by the ESR \n(Equivalent Series Resistance) of MLCC  when AC voltage or pulse voltage is applied to MLCC.  \n \n \n2-6-1. When MLCC is used in an AC voltage or pulse voltage circuit, self -heating is generated when AC  \n      or pulse current fl ows through MLCC. Short -circuit may be occurred by the degradation of MLCC’s  \n      insulating properties.  \n \n2-6-2. The reliability of MLCC may be affected  by MLCC being used in an  AC voltage or pulse voltage  \n      circuit , even the AC voltage or  the pulse voltage is within the range of rated voltage.  \n      Therefore, make sure to check the following conditions.  \n \n1) The surface temperature of MLCC must stay within the maximum operating temperature after  \n  AC or Pulse voltage is applied.   \n \n2) The rise in increase by self -heating of MLCC must not exceed 20℃  \n \n \n[ Example of Ripple current ]  \n* Sample : X5R 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n \n \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-7. DC & AC V oltage Characteristics  \n \nIt is required to consider voltage characteristics in the circuit since the capacitance value of high \ndielectric constant MLCC( Class II) is changed by applied DC & AC voltage.  \n \n2-7-1. Please ensure the capacitance change is within the allowed operating ran ge of a system . In   \n      particular, w hen high dielectric constant type MLCC (Class II) is used in circuit with narrow allowed  \n      capacitance tolerance , a system should be designed with consider ing DC voltage, temperature  \n      characteristics  and aging characteristics  of MLCC.  \n \n \n[ Example of DC Bias characteristics  ] \n* Sample : X5R 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n \n2-7-2. It is necessary to consider the AC voltage characteristics of MLCC and the AC voltage of a system ,      \n      since the capacitance value of high dielectric constant type MLCC (Class II) varies with the applied  \n      AC voltage.  \n \n \n[ Example of AC voltage characteristics  ] \n* Sample : X5R 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-8. Impedance Characteristic  \n \nElectrical impedance (Z) of MLCC is the measurement of the opposition that MLCC presents to a \ncurrent (I) when a voltage (V) is applied. It is defined as the ratio of the voltage to the current \n(Z=V/I). Impedance extends the concept of resistance to AC circuits and is a complex nu mber \nconsisting of the real part of resistance (R) and the imaginary part of reactance (X) as Z=R+jX.  \nTherefore, it is required to design circuit with consideration of the impedance characteristics of \nMLCC based on  the frequency ( Z = R + jX )  \n \n \n2-8-1. MLCC operates as a capacitor in the low frequency and its reactance (XC) decreases as frequency  \nincreases ( X_C=1/j2πfC ) where f is frequency and C is capacitance.  \nThe resistance (ESR;  Equivalent Series Resistance) of MLCC in the low frequency mainly comes  \nfrom the loss of its  dielectric material.  \n \n2-8-2. MLCC operates as an inductor in the high frequency and the inductance of MLCC is called ESL  \n(Equivalent Series Inductance). The reactance (XL) of MLCC in the high frequency increases as  \nfrequency increases ( X_L=j2πf∙ESL ). The resistance (ESR) of MLCC in the high frequency mainly  \ncomes from the loss of its electrode metal.  \n \n2-8-3. SRF (Self Resonant Frequency) of MLCC is the frequency where its capacitive reactance (XC) and  \ninductive  reactance(XL) cancel each other and the impedance of MLCC has only ESR at SRF.  \n \n \n2-8-4. The impedance of MLCC can be measured by a network analyzer or an impedance analyzer.   \n      When using the network analyzer, please note that the small -signal input  may lead to the \n      impedance of low capacitance caused by  the AC voltage characteristic of MLCC.  \n \n \n[ Example of Impedance  characteristics  ] \n* Sample : X5R 1uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n3. Electrical & Mechanical  Caution  \n \n3-1. Derating  \n \nMLCC with the test voltage at 100% of the rated voltage in the high temperature resistance test  \nare labeled as “derated MLCC.” For this type of MLCC, the voltage and temperature should be  \nderated as shown in the following graph for the equivalent life ti me of a normal MLCC with the  \ntest voltage at 150% of the rated voltage in the high temperature resistance test.  \n \n3-1-1. The derated MLCC should be applied with the derating voltage and temperature as shown in the \nfollowing graph.  \n \n3-1-2. The “Temperature  of MLCC” in the x -axis of  the graph below indicates the surface temperature of \nMLCC including self -heating effect.

Cautions by types of voltage applied to MLCC   \n \n· For DC voltage or DC+AC voltage, DC voltage or the maximum value of DC + AC  voltage should  \n  not exceed the rated voltage of MLCC.  \n· For AC voltage or pulse voltage, the peak -to-peak value of AC voltage or pulse voltage  \nshould not exceed the rated voltage of MLCC.  \n· Abnormal voltage such as surge voltage, static electricity should not exceed the rated voltage o f \nMLCC.  \n \n[Types of Voltage Applied to the Capacitor]  \nDC Voltage  AC Voltage  DC+AC Voltage 1  DC+AC Voltage 2  DC+Pulse Voltage  \n     \n \n3-2-2. Effect of EOS (Electrical Overstress)  \n \n· Electrical Overstress such as a surge voltage  or EOS can cause damage s to MLCC, resulting in \nthe electrical short failure caused by the dielectric breakdown in MLCC.  \n· Down time of MLCC is varied with the applied voltage and the room temperature  and a \ndielectric  shock caused by EOS can accelerate heating on the dielectric . Therefore, it can bring \nabout a failure of MLCC in a market at the early stage.  \n· Please use caution not to apply excessive electrical overstress including spike voltage MLCC when \npreparing MLCC for testing or evaluating.  \n \n(1) Surge  \nWhen the overcurrent caused by surge is applied to MLCC, the influx of current into MLCC can \ninduce the overshooting phenomenon of voltage as shown in the graph below and result in the \nelectrical short failure in MLCC. Therefore , it is necessary to be care ful to prevent the influx of \nsurge current into MLCC.  \n \n(2) ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)  \n \nSince the voltage of the static electricity is very high but the quantity of electric charge is small \ncompared to the surge, ESD can cause damage to MLCC with low ca pacitance as shown in the \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \nfollowing graph, whereas surge with lots of electric charge quantity can cause damages to even \nhigh capacitance MLCC.  \n \n   \n[ Example of Surge applied to MLCC ]             [ Example of ESD applied to MLCC ]  \n* Simulation for ESD 8kV \n \n \n3-3. Vibration  \n \n      Please check the types of vibration  and shock , and the status of resonance.  \n      Manage MLCC not to generate resonance and avoid any kind of  impact to terminals.  \n      When MLCC  is used in a vibration environment, please make sure to contact us for the situation  \n      and conside r special MLCC such as Soft -term, etc.  \n \n \n3-4. Shock \n \nMechanical stress caused by  a drop may cause damages to a dielectric or a crack in MLCC \nDo not use a dropped MLCC to avoid any quality and reliability deterioration.  \nWhen piling up or handling printed circuit boards, do not hit MLCC with the corners of a PCB to \nprevent cracks or any other damages to the MLCC.  \n \n \n3-5. Piezo -electric Phenomenon  \n \nMLCC may generate a noise due to vibration at specific frequency when using the high dielectric \nconstant MLCC (Class Ⅱ) at AC or Pulse circuits.  \nMLCC may cause a noise if MLCC is affected by any mechanical vibrations or shocks.  \n \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4. Process of Mounting  and Soldering  \n \n4-1. Mounting  \n \n4-1-1.

Cautions during mou nting near the cutout  \nPlease take the following measures to effectively reduce the stress generated from the cutting of  \nPCB. Select the mounting location shown below , since the mechanical stress is affected by a   \nlocation and a direction of MLCC mounted near the cutting line.  \n \n \n \n4-1-3. Cautions during mounting near screw  \nIf MLCC is mounted near a screw hole, the board deflection  may be occurred  by screw torque.  \nMount MLCC as far from the screw hole s as possible . \n \n \nNot recommended        Recommended  \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-2.

Check the capacitance characteristics under actual applied voltage.  \n4-2-3. Check the mechanical stress when actual process and equipment is in use.  \n4-2-4. Check the rated capacitance, rated voltage and other electrical characteristics before assembly.  \n     Heat treatment must be done prior to measurement of capacitance.  \n4-2-5. Check the solderability of MLCC that has passed shelf life befor e use.  \n4-2-6. The use of Sn -Zn based solder may deteriorate the reliability of MLCC.  \n \n \n4-3. Cautions during Mounting with Mounting (pick -and-place) Machines  \n \n4-3-1. Mounting Head Pressure  \nExcessive pressure may cause cracks in MLCC. \nIt is recommended to adjust the nozzle pressure within the maximum value of 300g.f.  \nAdditional conditions must be set for both thin film and special purpose MLCC.  \n4-3-2. Bending Stress  \nWhen using a two-sided sub strate, it is required to mount MLCC on one side first before \nmounting on the other  side due to the bending of the substrate caused by the mounting head . \nSupport the substrate as shown in the picture below when MLCC is mounted on the other side.  \nIf the substrate is not supported, bending of the substrate may cause cracks  in MLCC.  \n \n \n \n4-3-3. Suction nozzle  \nDust accumulated in a suction nozzle and suction mechanism can impede a smo oth movement of \nthe nozzle.  This may cause cracks in MLCC due to the excessive force during mounting.  \nIf the mounting claw is worn out,  it may ca use cracks in  MLCC due to the uneven force during \npositioning.  \n A regular inspection such as maintenance, monitor and replace ment for the suction nozzle and  \n mounting claw should be conducted.  \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-4. Reflow soldering  \n \nMLCC is in a direct contact with the dissolved solder during soldering, which may be exposed to \npotential mechanical stress caused by the sudden temperature change.  \nTherefore, MLCC may be contaminated by the location movement and flux.   \nFor the reason, the mounting pro cess must be closely monitored . \n \nMethod  Classification  \nReflow soldering  Overall heating  Infrared rays  \nHot plate  \nVPS(Vapor phase)  \nLocal heating  Air heater  \nLaser \nLight beam  \n \n4-4-1. Reflow Profile  \n \n[Reflow Soldering Conditions]  \n \nUse caution not to exceed the peak temperature (260℃) and time (30sec) as shown.  \nPre-heating is necessary for all constituents including the PCB to prevent the mechanical damages  \non MLCC. The temperature difference between the PCB and the component surface must be ke pt  \nto the minimum . \n \n      As for reflow soldering, it is recommended to keep the number o f reflow soldering to less than  \n      three times. Please check with us when the number of reflow soldering needs to exceed three  \n      times. Care must be exercised  especially for the ultra -small size,  thin film and high capacitance  \n      MLCC as they can be affected by thermal stress more easily.  \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-4-2. Reflow temperature  \nThe following quality problem may occur when MLCC is mounted with a lower temperature than \nthe reflow temperature recommended by a solder manufacturer.  The specified peak temperature \nmust be maintained after taking into consideration the factors such as the placement of \nperipheral  constituent and the reflow temperature.  \n \n･Drop in solder wettability  \n･Solder voids  \n･Potential occurrence of whisker  \n･Drop in adhesive strength  \n･Drop in self -alignment properties  \n･Potential occurrence of tombstones  \n \n4-4-3. Cooling  \nNatural cooling with air is recommended . \n \n4-4-4. Optimum solder flux for reflow soldering  \n· Overly the thick application of solder pastes results in an excessive solder fillet height.  \n  This makes MLCC more vulnerable to the mechanical and thermal stress from the board, which  \n  may cause cracks in MLCC.  \n· Too little solder paste results in a lac k of the adhesive strength, which may cause MLCC to \nisolate from PCB  \n· Check if solder has been applied uniformly after solderin g is completed.  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n· It is required  to design a PCB with consideration of a solder land pattern and its size to apply an  \n appropriate  amount of solder to MLCC. The amount of the solder at the edge may impact  \n directly  on cracks in MLCC.  \n \n· The design of a suitable solder land is necessary since the more the solder amount is,  \n  the larger the force MLCC experiences and the higher the chance MLCC cracks.  \n \n \nToo Much Solder  \nlarge stress may cause cracks  Not enough solder  \nWeak holding force may cause bad \nconnections or detaching of the capacitor  \n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-5.

Caution before Flow soldering  \n \n· When a sudden heat is applied to MLCC, the mechanical rigidity of MLCC is deteriorated by the \ninternal deformation of MLCC. Preheating all the constituents including PCB is required to prevent \nthe mechanical damages on MLCC.  The temperature difference between the  solder and the \nsurface of MLCC must be kept to the  minimum.  \n \n· If the flow time is too long or the flow temperature is too high,  the adhesive strength with PCB \nmay be deteriorated by the leaching phenomenon of the outer termination , or the capacitance \nvalue may be dropped by weak adhesion between the internal termination  and the outer \ntermination.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-6. Soldering Iron  \n \nManual soldering can pose a great risk on creating thermal cracks in MLCC.  The high temperature  \nsoldering iron tip may come into a direct contact with the ceramic body of MLCC  due to the  \ncarelessness of an operator. Therefore, the soldering iron must be handled carefully,  and close  \nattention must be paid to the selection of  the soldering iron tip and to temperature control of the  \ntip. \n \n4-6-1. How to use a soldering Iron  \n· In order to minimize damages on M LCC, preheating MLCC and PCB is necessary.  \n  A hot plate and a hot air type preheater should be used for preheating  \n. Do not cool down MLCC and PCB rapidly after soldering.  \n· Keep the contact time between the outer termination of MLCC and the soldering iron as short as  \n  possible. Long soldering time  may cause problems such as adhesion deterioration  by the  \n  leaching phenomenon of the outer termination . \n \nVariation of \nTemp.

How to use a spot heater  \n· Compared to local heating using a solder iron, heat by a spot heater heats the overall MLCC and \nthe PCB, which is likely to lessen the thermal shocks.   \nFor a high density PCB, a spot heater can prevent  the problem to connect between a solder iron \nand MLCC directly.  \n \n· If the distance from the air nozzle outlet to MLCC is too close, MLCC may be cracked due to the  \nthermal  stress.  Follow the conditions set in the table below to prevent this problem.  \nThe spot heater application angle as shown in the figure is recommended to create a suitable  \nsolder fillet shape.  \n \n· In case that heat of higher  than 350℃ is applied to MLCC containing epoxy material,  \nthe epoxy material in MLCC may be damaged by heat . \n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4-6-3. Caution s for re-work \n· Too much solder amount will increase the risk of PCB bending or cause other damages.  \n· Too little solder amount will result in MLCC breaking loose from the PCB due to the \ninadequate adhesive strength.  \n· Check if the solder has been applied p roperly and ensure the solder fillet has a proper shape.  \n \n \n* Soldering wire below ø0.5mm is required for soldering . \n \n \n4-7. Cleaning  \n \n4-7-1. In general , cleaning is unnecessary if rosin flux is used.  \nWhen acidic flux is used  strongly , chlorine in the flux may dissolve into some types of cleaning \nfluids, thereby affecting the performance of MLCC.  \nThis means that the cleansing solution must be carefully selected and should always be new.  \n \n4-7-2. Cautions for cleaning  \n      MLCC or sold er joint may be cracked with the vibration of PCB, if ult rasonic vibration is too strong  \n      during cleaning. When high pressure cleaning equipment is used, test should be done for the  \n      cleaning  equipment and its process before the cleaning in order to avoid damages on MLCC.  \n \n \nDistance  ≥ 5㎜ \nHot Air Application angle  45℃ \nHot Air Temperature Nozzle Outlet  ≤ 400℃ \nApplication Time  ≤ 10s \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-8.

Mounting other components  \nPay attention to the following conditions  when mounting other components on the back side of  \nThe board after MLCC has been mounted on the front side.  \nWhen the suction nozzle is placed too close to the board, board deflection stress may be  \napplied to MLCC on the back side , resulting in cracks in MLCC. \nCheck if proper value is set on each chip mounter for a suction location, a mounting gap and a \nsuction gap by the thickness of component s. \n \n \n \n4-10-3. Board mounting components with leads   \n If the board is bent when inserting components (transformer, IC, etc.) into it, MLCC or solder  \njoint may be cracked . \n \nPay attention to the following:  \n· Reduce the stress on the board during insertion by increasing the size of the lead insertion  \n  hole. \n· Insert components with leads  into the board  after fixing the board with support pins or a  \n  dedicated jig.  \n· Support the bottom side of the board to avoid bending the board.  \n· Check the status of the height of each support pin regularly when the support pins are used.  \n \n \nNot recommended                            Recommended  \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-10-4.

Fastening screw  \nWhen attaching a shield on a board , the board may be bent during a screw tightening  work \n \nPay attention to the following conditions  before performing the work.   \n· Plan the work to prevent the board from bending  \n· Use a torque driver to prevent over -tightening of the screw.  \n· Since the board may  be bent by soldering,  use caution in tightening the screw.  \n \n \n4-11. Adhesive selection  \n \nPay attention to the following if an adhesive is used to position MLCC on the board before   \nsoldering.  \n \n4-11-1. Requirements for Adhesives  \n· They must have enough adhesive strength to prevent MLCC from slipping or moving during  \n  the handling  the board . \n· They must maintain their adhesive strength when exposed to soldering temperatures.  \n· They should not spread when applied to the PCB.  \n      · They should have a long pot life.  \n· They should hardened quickly.  \n      · They should not corrode the board or ML CC material s. \n· They should be an i nsulator  type that does not affect the characteristic of MLCC .   \n      · They should be non -toxic, not harmful, and particula rly safe when workers touch the adhesives.  \n \n4-11-2.

Cautions for select ing Adhesive  \nDepending on the type of the chosen adhesive, MLCC insulation resistance may be degrade d. \nIn addition, MLCC may be cracked by the difference in contractile stress caused by the different \ncontraction rate between  MLCC and the adhesive.  \n \n4-11-4. Cautions for  the amount of applied a dhesive and curing temperature  \n· The ina ppropriate  amount of the adhesive cause the weak adhesive strength , resulting in the a  \n  mounting defect  in MLCC  \n· Excessive use of the adhesive may cause a soldering defect, loss of electrical connection,  \n  incorrect curing, or slippage of a mounting position, thereby an inflow of the adhesive onto a  \n  land section should be avoided . \n   · If the curing temperature is too high or the curing time is too long, the adhesive strength will  \n     be degraded. In addition, oxidation both on the outer termination (Sn) of MLCC and the  \n     surface of the board ma y deteriorate the solderability . \n \n \n4-12. Flux  \n \n4-12-1. The excessive amount of flux generates excessive flux gases which may deteriorate solderability . \nTherefore, apply the f lux thin and evenly as a whole.  \n4-12-2.

In addition, they are more sensitive to mechanical and  \n      thermal  stress than lead type components.  \n \n \n5-2-2. MLCC crack  by PCB material type  \nA great difference of the thermal expansion coefficient betwe en PCB and MLCC causes thermal  \nexpansion  and contraction, resulting in cracks in MLCC. Even though MLCC is mounted on a  \nboard with a fluorine resin or on a single -layered glass epoxy, cracks in MLCC may occur.  \n \n \n \n5-3. Design system evaluation  \n \n5-3-1. Evaluate the actual design with MLCC to make  sure there is no functional issue or violation of \nspecification s of the finished goods.  \n \n5-3-2. Please note that the capacitance may differ based on the operating condition of the actual system  \nsince Class 2 MLCC capacitance varies with applied voltage and temperature.  \n \n5-3-3. Surge resistance must be evaluated since the excessive surge caused by the inductance of the  \n      actual system may apply to MLCC . \n \n5-3-4. Note the actual MLCC size and  the termination shape.  \n \n [문서 인용문이나  흥미로운  부분에  대\n한 요약을  입력하십시오 . 문서의  원하\n는 위치에  텍스트  상자를  넣을 수 있\n습니다 . 인용문  텍스트  상자의  서식을  \n변경하려면  [그리기  도구] 탭을 사용\n하십시오 .] \n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n5-4 Land dimension  \nThe recommended land dimension is determined by evaluating the actual SET and a board.  \n       \nReflow Footprint        \nChip Size  Chip Tol.  a b c (a+2b)  \nmin (a+2b)  \nmax Wmin  Wmax  \n[mm] [mm] [mm] [mm] [mm] \n0201 ± 0.013 0.07~0.08 0.09~0.14  0.125~0.135  0.25 0.36 0.125 0.135 \n± 0.03 0.07~0.09 0.10~0.15  0.135~0.145  0.27 0.39 0.135 0.145 \n0402 ± 0.02 0.14~0.18  0.19~0.23  0.20~0.24  0.52 0.64 0.20 0.24 \n± 0.05 0.15~0.19  0.20~0.24  0.23~0.27  0.55 0.67 0.23 0.27 \n05025  ± 0.025 0.18~0.22  0.24~0.28  0.25~0.29  0.66 0.78 0.25 0.29 \n0603 ± 0.03 0.22~0.28  0.31~0.37  0.30~0.36 0.84 1.02 0.30 0.36 \n± 0.05 0.23~0.29 0.32~0.38  0.32~0.38 0.87 1.05 0.32 0.38 \n± 0.07 0.24~0.30  0.32~0.38  0.35~0.40 0.88 1.06 0.35 0.40 \n± 0.09 0.25~0.31  0.33~0.39  0.36~0.42  0.91 1.09 0.36 0.42 \n1005 ± 0.05 0.36~0.44 0.49~0.57  0.51~0.59  1.34 1.58 0.51 0.59 \n± 0.07 0.37~0.45 0.49~0.57  0.53~0.61  1.35 1.59 0.53 0.61 \n± 0.10 0.38~0.46 0.50~0.58  0.56~0.64  1.38 1.62 0.56 0.64 \n± 0.15 0.40~0.48 0.52~0.60  0.61~0.69  1.44 1.68 0.61 0.69 \n± 0.20 0.42~0.50 0.53~0.61  0.66~0.74  1.48 1.72 0.66 0.74 \n± 0.25 0.44~0.52  0.55~0.63  0.71~0.79  1.54 1.78 0.71 0.79 \n± 0.30 0.45~0.53 0.56~0.64  0.76~0.84  1.57 1.81 0.76 0.84 \n± 0.40 0.49~0.57  0.59~0.67  0.86~0.94  1.67 1.91 0.86 0.94 \n1608 ± 0.10 0.63~0.73  0.71~0.81  0.80~0.90 2.05 2.35 0.80 0.90 \n± 0.15 0.65~0.75  0.73~0.83 0.90~1.00  2.11 2.41 0.90 1.00 \n± 0.20 0.67~0.77  0.74~0.84  0.95~1.05  2.15 2.45 0.95 1.05 \n± 0.25 0.69~0.79  0.76~0.86  1.00~1.10  2.21 2.51 1.00 1.10 \n± 0.30 0.71~0.81  0.77~0.87  1.05~1.15  2.25 2.55 1.05 1.15 \n2012 ±0.10 0.79~0.89  0.88~0.98  1.25~1.35 2.55 2.85 1.25 1.35 \n±0.15 0.81~0.91  0.90~1.00  1.30~1.40 2.61 2.91 1.30 1.40 \n±0.20 0.83~0.93  0.91~1.01  1.35~1.45 2.65 2.95 1.35 1.45 \n±0.25 0.85~0.95 0.93~1.03  1.40~1.50 2.71 3.01 1.40 1.50 \n±0.30 0.89~0.97  0.94~1.04  1.45~1.55 2.75 3.05 1.45 1.55 \n3216 ±0.20 1.64~1.76  1.19~1.31  1.74~1.86  4.02 4.38 1.74 1.86 \n±0.30 1.69~1.81  1.22~1.34  1.84~1.96  4.13 4.49 1.84 1.96 \n3225 ±0.20 1.64~1.76  1.29~1.41  2.64~2.76  4.22 4.58 2.64 2.76 \n±0.30 1.69~1.81  1.32~1.44  2.74~2.86  4.33 4.69 2.74 2.86 \n4532 ±0.40 2.17~2.33  1.75~1.91 3.42~3. 58 5.67 6.15 3.42 3.58 \n5750 ±0.40 2.75~2.95  2.03~2.23  5.30~5.50  6.81 7.41 5.30 5.50 \n\n \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n         \nFlow Footprint        \nChip Size  Tol. a b c (a+2b)  (a+2b)  \nWmin  Wmax  \n[mm] [mm] [mm] [mm] [mm] min max \n1608 - 0.60~1.00  0.60~0.80  0.60~0.80  1.8 2.6 0.6 0.8 \n2012 - 1.00~1.20  0.80~1.20  0.80~1.20  2.6 3.6 0.8 1.2 \n3216 - 2.00~2.40  1.00~1.20  1.00~1.40  4 4.8 1 1.4 \n3225 - 2.00~2.40  1.00~1.20  2.00~2.40  4 4.8 2 2.4 \n \n \n6.
