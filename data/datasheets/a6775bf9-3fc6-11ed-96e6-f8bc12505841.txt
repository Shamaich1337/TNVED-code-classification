Exposure to any Absolute \nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device \nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Absolute maximum input-to-output differential voltage is not \nachievable with all combinations of rated IN pin and OUT pin voltages. \nWith the IN pin at 45V, the OUT pin may not be pulled below 0V. The total \nIN to OUT differential voltage must not exceed ±45V.\nNote 3: The LT3086-EP is tested and specified under pulse load conditions \nsuch that T J ≅ T A. The LT3086-EP is 100% tested over the –55°C to 125°C \noperating junction temperature range. High junction temperatures degrade \noperating lifetimes. Operating lifetime is derated at junction temperatures \ngreater than 125°C.\nNote 4: The LT3086-EP is tested and specified for these conditions with \nthe SET pin connected to the OUT pin, V OUT = 0.4V.\nNote 5: Maximum junction temperature limits operating conditions. The \nregulated output voltage specification does not apply for all possible \ncombinations of input voltage and output current. Limit the output current \nrange if operating at large input-to-output voltage differentials. Limit \nthe input-to-output voltage differential if operating at maximum output \ncurrent. Current limit foldback limits the maximum output current as a \nfunction of input-to-output voltage. See Current Limit vs V IN – V OUT in the \nTypical Performance Characteristics section.\nNote 6: Load regulation is Kelvin-sensed at the package.\nNote 7: To  satisfy minimum input voltage requirements, the LT3086-EP is \ntested and specified for these conditions with a 32k resistor between OUT \nand SET for a 2V output voltage.\nNote 8: Dropout voltage is the minimum input-to-output voltage \ndifferential needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. \nIn dropout, the output voltage equals: (V IN – V DROPOUT ). For low output \nvoltages and certain load conditions, minimum input voltage requirements \nlimit dropout voltage. See the Minimum Input Voltage curve in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics section.Note 9: GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  + 0.55V and \nPWRGD pin floating. GND pin current increases in dropout. See GND pin \ncurrent curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section and the \nLT3086 data sheet.\nNote 10: SHDN pin current flows into the SHDN pin.\nNote 11: Reverse-output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and \nthe OUT pin forced to a voltage. The current flows into the OUT pin and out \nof the GND pin.\nNote 12: The IC includes overtemperature protection circuitry that protects \nthe device during momentary overload conditions. Junction temperature \nexceeds 125°C when the overtemperature circuitry is active unless thermal \nlimit is externally set by loading the TEMP pin. Continuous operation above \nthe specified maximum junction temperature may impair device reliability.\nNote 13: The TEMP output voltage represents the average die temperature \nnext to the power transistor while the center of the transistor can be \nsignificantly hotter during high power conditions. Due to power dissipation \nand temperature gradients across the die, the TEMP output voltage \nmeasurement does not guarantee that absolute maximum junction \ntemperature is not exceeded.\nNote 14: Output current sharing error is the difference in output currents \nof a slave relative to its master when two LT3086-EP regulators are \nparalleled. The device is tested as a slave with V TRACK  = 0.693V, R MON \n= 330Ω and V SET = 0.4V, conditions when an ideal master is outputting \n2.1A. The specification limits account for the slave output tracking error \nfrom 2.1A and the worst-case error that can be contributed by a master: \nthe maximum deviation of V SET from 0.4V and I MON from 2.1mA.\nNote 15: The LT3086-EP is tested and specified for these conditions with \nthe I MON and I LIM pins tied together.\nNote 16: The LT3086-EP requires a minimum load current to ensure \nproper regulation and stability.\nLT3086-EP\n5\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comTYPICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\nGND Pin Current vs I LOAD\nOUTPUT CURRENT (A)0GND PIN CURRENT (mA)60\n40\n2050\n30\n10\n0\n1.2 0.6\n3086 G012.1 0.9 0.3 1.5 1.8VIN = VOUT(NOMINAL)  + 0.55V\n125°C\n25°C\n–40°C\n–55°CIOUT/IMON Ratio\nOUTPUT CURRENT (A)0IOUT/IMON RATIO (A/A)1060\n1050\n1030\n1010\n1000\n980\n9601040\n1020\n990\n970\n950\n940\n1.2\n3086 G022.1 1.5 1.8 0.9 0.3 0.6IMON = VIMON /RMON\nIMON TIED TO I LIM\nRMON = 330/uni03A9\nVIN = VOUT + 0.55V\n125°C\n25°C\n–40°C\n–55°C\nInternal Current Limit \nvs V IN – V OUTCDC Amplifier Gain\nCDC Pin Internal Clamp Fault \nCurrentRCDC (k/uni03A9)0CDC/V IMON  VOL TAGE GAIN (V/V)0.343\n0.341\n0.337\n0.333\n0.327\n0.3250.339\n0.335\n0.331\n0.329\n0.323\n70 20\n3086 G03100 30 10 80 90 60 40 50VIMON  = 800mV TO 0mV\n125°C\n25°C\n–40°C\n–55°C\nCDC PIN VOL TAGE (V)0CDC PIN CURRENT (mA)8\n7\n5\n36\n4\n2\n1\n0\n7 2\n3086 G0410 3 1 8 9 6 4 5VOUT > VOUT(NOMINAL)\n125°C\n25°C\n–40°C\n–55°C\nINPUT/OUTPUT DIFFERENTIAL (V)CURRENT LIMIT (A)3.0\n2.7\n2.1\n1.5\n0.32.4\n1.8\n1.2\n0.60.9\n0\n3086 G050 25 40 5 30 35 20 10 15∆VOUT = –5% 125°C\n25°C\n–40°C\n–55°C\nLT3086-EP\n6\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS (TSSOP)\nGND (Pins 1, 8, 9, 16, Exposed Pad Pin 17): Ground. \nThe exposed pad of the TSSOP package is an electrical \nconnection to GND. To ensure proper electrical and thermal  \nperformance, tie the exposed pad or tab directly to the \nremaining GND pins of the relevant package and the PCB \nground. GND pin current is typically 1.2mA at zero load \nand increases to about 44mA at full load.\nILIM (Pin 2): External Current Limit Programming. This \npin externally programs current limit if connected to \nIMON and a resistor to GND. Current limit activates if the \nvoltage at ILIM equals 0.8V. Current limit equals: 1000 • \n(0.8V/R MON). An internal clamp typically limits the ILIM \nvoltage to 1V. If external current limit is set to less than \n1A, connect a series 1k-10nF network in parallel with the \nRMON resistor for stability . Internal current limit foldback \noverrides  externally  programmed current  limit if VIN – VOUT \ndifferential voltage is excessive. If external current limit \nprogramming is not used, then ground this pin.\nIMON (Pin 2): Output Current Monitor. This pin sources a \ncurrent equal to 1/1000 of output load current. Connect -\ning a resistor from IMON to GND programs a load current \ndependent voltage for monitoring by an ADC. If IMON \nconnects to ILIM, current limit is externally programmable.\nCDC (Pin 3): Cable Drop Compensation. Connecting a \nsingle resistor (R CDC) between the CDC and SET pins \nprovides programmable cable drop compensation that \ncancels output voltage errors caused by resistive connec -\ntions to the load. A resistor (R MON) from IMON to GND is \nalso required to enable Cable Drop Compensation. Choose \nRMON first based on required current limit.\n RMON = 0.8V • 1000/I LIM\nCalculate the value of R CDC with this formula:\n RCDC = (R MON • RSET)/(3000 • R WIRE)\nwhere RWIRE is the total cable or wire resistance to and \nfrom the load. From a practical application standpoint, \nLT C recommends limiting cable drop compensation to \n20% of VOUT for applications needing good regulation. \nThe limiting factor is variations in wire temperature as \ncopper wire resistance changes about 19% for a 50°C \ntemperature change. If output regulation requirements are loose (e.g., when using a secondary regulator), cable \ndrop compensation of up to 50% may be used.\nRPWRGD  (Pin 4): Power Good Threshold Voltage Program -\nming. This pin is the input to the power good compara -\ntor. Connecting a resistor between OUT and RPWRGD  \nprograms an adjustable power good threshold voltage. \nThe threshold voltage is 0.4V  on the RPWRGD  pin, and a \n50µA  current source is connected from RPWRGD  to GND. \nIf the voltage at RPWRGD  is less than 0.4V , the PWRGD  \nflag asserts and pulls low. If the voltage at RPWRGD  is \ngreater than 0.4V , the PWRGD flag de-asserts and be-\ncomes high impedance. For most applications, PWRGD  \nis pulled high with a pull-up resistor. Calculate the value  \nof RPWRGD  with this formula: \n RPWRGD  = (X • V OUT(NOMINAL)  – 0.4V)/50µA\nwhere X is normally in the 85% to 95% range.\nA 17µs deglitching filter suppresses false tripping of the \nPWRGD flag at the rising edge of PWRGD with instant \nreset. Hysteresis at the RPWRGD  pin is typically 0.6% on \nthe 0.4V threshold and the 50µA current source.\nSET (Pin 5): Output Voltage Programming. This pin is the \nerror amplifier’s inverting terminal. It regulates to 0.4V \nand a 50µA current source is connected from SET to GND. \nConnecting a single resistor from OUT to SET programs \noutput voltage. Calculate the value of the required resistor \nfrom the formula:\n RSET = (V OUT – 0.4V)/50µA\nConnecting a capacitor in parallel with RSET provides output  \nvoltage soft-start capability, improves transient response \nand decreases output voltage noise.\nThe LT3086-EP error amplifier design is configured so \nthat the regulator always operates in unity-gain.\nOUT (Pins 6, 7): Output. These pin(s) supply power to \nthe load. Connect all OUT pins together on the DHD and \nFE packages for proper operation. Stability requirements \ndemand a minimum 10µF ceramic output capacitor with \nan ESR less than 100mΩ to prevent oscillations. Large \nload transients require larger output capacitance to limit \npeak voltage transients. Permissible output voltage range \nis 0.4V to 32V. The LT3086-EP requires a 1mA minimum \nload current to ensure proper regulation and stability .\nLT3086-EP\n7\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS (TSSOP)\nIN (Pins 10, 11): Input. These pin(s) supply power to the \ndevice. Connect all IN pins together for proper operation. \nThe LT3086-EP requires a local IN bypass capacitor if it \nis located more than a few inches from the main input \nfilter capacitor. In general, battery output impedance rises \nwith frequency, so adding a bypass capacitor in battery \npowered circuits is advisable. A 10µF minimum input \ncapacitor generally suffices. The IN pin(s) withstand a \nreverse voltage of 45V. The device limits current flow and \nno negative voltage appears at OUT. The device protects \nitself and the load against batteries that are plugged in \nbackwards.\nSHDN (Pin 12): Shutdown/UVLO. Pulling the SHDN pin \ntypically below 1V puts the LT3086-EP into a low power \nstate and turns the output off. Quiescent current in shut-\ndown is typically less than 1µA. The SHDN pin turn-on \nthreshold is typically 1.22V. This pin may either be used as \na shutdown function or as an undervoltage lockout function. \nIf using this pin as an undervoltage lockout function, use \na resistor divider between IN and GND with the tap point \ntied to SHDN. If using the pin as a shutdown function, \ndrive the pin with either logic or an open-collector/drain \nwith a pull-up resistor. The resistor supplies the pull-up \ncurrent to the open-collector/drain logic, normally several \nmicroamperes, and the SHDN pin current, typically less \nthan 10µA at 6V. If unused, connect the SHDN pin to IN.\nTEMP ( Pin 13): Die Junction Temperature. This pin outputs  \na voltage indicating the LT3086-EP average die junction \ntemperature. At 25°C, this pin typically outputs 250mV. \nThe TEMP pin slope equals 10mV/°C so that at 125°C, \nthis pin typically outputs 1.25V. This pin does not read \ntemperatures less than 0°C. The TEMP pin is not meant \nto be an accurate temperature sensor, but is useful for \ndebug, monitoring and calculating thermal resistance \nof the package mounted to the PCB. The TEMP pin also \nincorporates the ability to program a thermal limit tem-\nperature lower than the internal typical thermal shutdown \ntemperature of 165°C. Tying a resistor from TEMP to GND programs the thermal limit temperature with a 100µA trip \npoint. Calculate the value of the resistor from the formula:\n RTEMP=TSHDN•10mV\n°C⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n100µA\nwhere TSHDN is the desired die thermal limit temperature.\nThere are several degrees of hysteresis in the thermal \nshutdown that cycles the regulator output on and off. Limit \nthe capacitance on the TEMP pin to less than 100pF. To \nprevent saturation in the TEMP output device, ensure that \nVIN is higher than V TEMP by 250mV.\nTRACK (Pin 14): T rack pin for paralleling. The TRACK pin \nallows multiple LT3086-EPs to be paralleled in a master/\nslave(s) configuration for higher output current applica -\ntions. This also allows heat to be spread out on the PCB. \nThis circuit technique does not require ballast resistors \nand does not degrade load regulation. Tying the TRACK \npin of the slave device(s) to the IMON/ILIM pins of the \nmaster device enables this function. If the TRACK function \nis unused, TRACK is in a default clamped high state. A \nTRACK pin voltage below 1.2V on slave device (s) shuts \noff the internal 50µA reference current at SET such that \nonly the 50µA reference current of the master device is \nactive. All SET pins must be tied together in a master/\nslave configuration.\nPWRGD (Pin 15): Power Good Flag. The PWRGD pin is \nan open-collector logic pin connected to the output of the \npower good comparator. PWRGD asserts low if the RPWRGD  \npin is less than 400mV. The maximum low output level \nof 200mV over temperature is defined for 200μA of sink \ncurrent. If RPWRGD  is greater than 400mV, the PWRGD \npin de-asserts and becomes high impedance. The PWRGD \npin may be pulled to 36V without damaging any internal \ncircuitry regardless of the input voltage.\nLT3086-EP\n8\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comBLOCK DIAGRAM\n0.05/uni03A9 QPOWER\n50/uni03A9120mV\n40k\n3086 BDIN\nGND100k 100k900mV 900mVIMON\nILIMOUT\nCDC\nENEN300mV\n–+\n120kCABLE\nDROP COMP\n–+\nCURRENT\nMONITOR+–\nINTERNAL\nILIMIT+–+–TEMP\n–++–\nEXTERNAL\nILIMIT\n+–\nTRACK\nENABLE300mV\n1.2V+–\nERROR\nAMPSET\nRPWRGD25k\n50µA\n50µA75k125k\nTRACK+–\nTRACK\ngm = 8µ13µA1.3V\nVREF\n400mV\nSHUTDOWN\nCONTROL17µs DELAY\nRPWRGD  RISING EDGE\nIN\nVTEMP\n10mV/°C\n25°C = 250mV\nSHDN1.22V\n100µAPWRGD\nTEMPIMON =IOUT\n1000\nLT3086-EP\n9\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comInformation furnished by Analog Devices is believed to be accurate and reliable.
