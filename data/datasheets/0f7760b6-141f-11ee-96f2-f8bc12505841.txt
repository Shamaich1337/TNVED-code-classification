The TxDAC fam ily, \nconsisting of pin -compatible 8 -, 10-, 12-, and 14 -bit DACs, \nis specifically optimized for the transmit signal path of \ncommun ication systems. All of the devices share the same interface \noptions, small outline package, and pinout, providing an upward  \nor downward component selection path based on perfo rmance, \nresolution, and cost. The AD9742 offers exceptional ac and dc \nperformance while supporting up date rates up to 210 MSPS.  \nThe AD9742’s low power dissipation makes it well suited for \nportable and low power applications. Its power dissipation can be further reduced to a mere 60 mW with a slight degradation in performance by lowering the full -scale cur rent output. Also, \na power -down mode reduces the standby power dissipation to \napproximately 15 mW . A segmented current source architecture is combined with a proprietary switching technique to reduce \nspurious components and enhance dynamic performance.  Edge-triggered input latches and a 1.2 V temperature compen sated  \nband gap reference have been integrated to provide a complete \nmonolithic DAC solution. The digital inputs support 3  V CMOS  \nlogic families.  \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS  \n1. The AD9742 is the 12- bit member of the pin -compatible \nTxDAC family, which offers excellent INL and DNL  \nperformance.  \n2. Data input supports twos complement or straight binary \ndata coding.  \n3. High speed, single -ended CMOS clock input supports \n210 MSPS conversion rate.  \n4. Low power: Complete CMOS DAC function operates on \n135 mW from a 2.7 V to 3.6 V single supply. The DAC full-scale current can be reduced for lower power operation, and a sleep mode is provided for low power idle periods.  \n5. On-chip voltage reference: The AD9742 includes a 1.2 V \ntemperatur e compensated band gap voltage reference. \n6. Industry -standard 28 -lead SOIC, 28 -lead TSSOP , and  \n32-lead LFCSP packages.  \n \n1 Protected by U.S. Patent Numbers : 5,568, 145; 5, 689, 257; and 5 ,703, 519.  \nAD9742 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 11 of 32 TERMINOLOGY \nLinearity Error (Also Called Integral Nonlinearity or INL)  \nLinearity error is defined as the maximum deviation of the \nactual analog output from the ideal output, determined by a \nstraight line drawn from zero to full scale.  \nDifferential Nonlinearity (or DNL)  \nDNL is the measure of the variat ion in analog value, normalized \nto full scale, associated with a 1 LSB change in digital input code.  \nMonotonicity  \nA DAC is monotonic if the output either increases or remains constant as the digital input increases.  \nOffset Error  \nThe deviation of the output  current from the ideal of zero is \ncalled the offset error. For IOUTA, 0 mA output is expected \nwhen the inputs are all 0s. For IOUTB, 0 mA output is expected \nwhen all inputs are set to 1s.  \nGain Error  \nThe difference between the actual and ideal output span.  The \nactual span is determined by the output when all inputs are set to 1s minus the output when all inputs are set to 0s. \nOutput Compliance Range  \nThe range of allowable voltage at the output of a current output \nDAC. Operation beyond the maximum compliance  limits may \ncause either output stage saturation or breakdown, resulting in nonlinear performance.  \nTemperature Drift  \nTemperature drift is specified as the maximum change from the ambient (25°C) value to the value at either T\nMIN or T MAX. For \noffset and gain  drift, the drift is reported in ppm of full -scale \nrange (FSR) per °C. For reference drift, the drift is reported in ppm per °C.  Power Supply Rejection  \nThe maximum change in the full -scale output as the supplies \nare varied from nominal to minimum and maxim um specified \nvoltages. \nSettling Time  \nThe time required for the output to reach and remain within a \nspecified error band about its final value, measured from the start of the output transition.  \nGlitch Impulse  \nAsymmetrical switching times in a DAC give rise to undesired \noutput transients that are quantified by a glitch impulse. It is \nspecified as the net area of the glitch in pV -s. \nSpurious -Free Dynamic Range  \nThe difference, in dB, between the rms amplitude of the output signal and the peak spurious signal ov er the specified \nbandwidth.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)  \nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of the first six harmonic components to the rms value of the measured input signal. It is expressed as a percentage or in decibels (dB).  \nMultitone Power Ratio  \nThe s purious -free dynamic range containing multiple carrier \ntones of equal amplitude. It is measured as the difference between the rms amplitude of a carrier tone to the peak \nspurious signal in the region of a removed tone.  \n \n \n \n150pF\n1.2V REFAVDD ACOM REFLO\nPMOS\nCURRENT SOURCE\nARRAY\nSEGMENTED SWITCHES\nFOR DB11–DB3LSB\nSWITCHESREFIO\nFS ADJ\nDVDD\nDCOM\nCLOCK3.3VRSET\n2kΩ0.1µF\nDVDD\nDCOMIOUTA\nIOUTBAD9742\nSLEEP50Ω\nRETIMED\nCLOCK\nOUTPUT*LATCHES\nDIGITAL\nDATA\nTEKTRONIX AWG-2021\nWITH OPTION 4LECROY 9210\nPULSE GENERATORCLOCK\nOUTPUT50ΩROHDE & SCHWARZ\nFSEA30SPECTRUMANALYZERMINI-CIRCUITS\nT1-1T\n*AWG2021 CLOCK RETIMED\nSO THAT THE DIGITAL DATATRANSITIONS ON FALLING EDGEOF 50% DUTY CYCLE CLOCK.3.3V\nMODE\n50Ω\n02912-B-005 \nFigure 22. Basic AC Characterization Test Set -Up (SOIC/TSSOP Packages)  \n \n \nAD9742 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 12 of 32 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nAD9742 consists of a DAC, digital control logic, and full -scale \noutput current control. The DAC contains a PMOS current \nsource array capable of providing up to 20 mA  of full -scale  \ncurrent (I OUTFS ). The array is divided into 31 equal currents that \nmake up the five most significant bits (MSBs). The next four bits, or middle bits, consist of 15 equal current sources whose value is 1/16th of an MSB current source. The re maining LSBs \nare binary weighted fractions of the middle bits current sources. Implementing the middle and lower bits with current sources, instead of an R -2R ladder, enhances its dynamic performance \nfor multitone or low amplitude signals and helps maintai n the \nDAC’s high output impedance (i.e., >100 kΩ).  \nAll of these current sources are switched to one or the other of the two output nodes (i.e., IOUTA or IOUTB) via PMOS \ndiffe rential current switches. The switches are based on the \narchitecture that was pion eered in the AD9764 family, with \nfurther  \nrefinements to reduce distortion contributed by the switc hing \ntransient. This switch architecture also reduces various ti ming \nerrors and provides matching complementary drive signals to \nthe inputs of the differenti al current switches. \nThe analog and digital sections of the AD9742 have separate power supply inputs (i.e., AVDD and DVDD) that can operate independently over a 2.7 V to 3.6 V range. The digital section, which is capable of operating at a rate of up to 210  MSPS, \nconsists of edge -triggered latches and segment decoding logic  \ncircuitry. The analog section includes the PMOS current sources, the associated differential switches, a 1.2 V band gap voltage reference, and a reference control amplifier.  \nThe DAC full -scale output current is regulated by the reference \ncontrol amplifier and can be set from 2 mA to 20 mA via an external resistor, R\nSET, connected to the full -scale adjust ( FS \nADJ)  pin. The external resistor, in combination with both the \nreference control a mplifier and voltage reference ,V REFIO, sets the \nreference current, I REF, which is replicated to the segmented \ncurrent sources with the proper scaling factor. The full -scale \ncurrent, I OUTFS , is 32 times I REF. REFERENCE OPERATION \nThe AD9742 contains an int ernal 1.2 V band gap reference. The \ninternal reference can be disabled by raising REFLO to AVDD. \nIt can also be easily overridden by an external reference with no \neffect on performance. REFIO serves as either an input or an output depending on whether the internal or an external reference is used. To use the internal reference, simply decouple \nthe REFIO pin to ACOM with a 0.1 µ F capacitor and connect  \nREFLO to ACOM via a resistance less than 5 Ω. The internal reference voltage will be present at REFIO. If the voltage at  \nREFIO is to be used anywhere else in the circuit, an external \nbuffer ampl ifier with an input bias current of less than 100 nA \nshould be used. An example of the use of the internal reference \nis shown in F igure 23. \n150pF\n1.2V REFAVDD REFLO\nCURRENT\nSOURCE\nARRAY3.3V\nREFIO\nFS ADJ\n2kΩ0.1µF\nAD9742ADDITIONAL\nLOADOPTIONAL\nEXTERNAL\nREF BUFFER\n02912-B-022 \nFigure 23.

The external reference may provide either a fixed \nreference voltage to enhance accuracy and d rift performance or \na varying reference voltage for gain control.

C | Page 13 of 32 REFERENCE CONTROL AM PLIFIER  \nThe AD9742 contains a control amplifier that is used to regulate \nthe full -scale output current, I OUTFS . The control amplifier is \nconfigu red as a V -I converter, as shown in Figure 24, so that its \ncurrent output, I REF, is determined by the ratio of the V REFIO and \nan external resistor, R SET, as stated in Equation 4. I REF is copied \nto the segmented current sources with the proper scale factor to \nset I OUTFS , as stated in Equation 3.  \nThe control amplifier allows a wide (10:1) adjustment span of IOUTFS over a 2 mA to 20 mA range by setting IREF between \n62.5 µA and 625 µA. The wide adjustment span of IOUTFS \nprovides several  benefits. The first relates directly to the power \ndissipation of the AD9742, which is proportional to IOUTFS (see  \nthe Power Dissipation  section). The second relates to the 20  dB \nadjustment, which is useful for syst em gain control pu rposes.  \nThe small signal bandwidth of the reference control amplifier is approximately 500 kHz and can be used for low frequency small \nsignal multiplying applications.  \nDAC TRANSFER FUNCTIO N \nBoth DACs in the AD9742 provide complementary cu rrent \noutputs, IOUTA  and IOUTB . IOUTA  provides a near full -scale \ncurrent output, I OUTFS , when all bits are high (i.e., DAC CODE  = \n4095), while IOUTB , the complementary output, provides no \ncurrent. The current output appearing at IOUTA  and IOUTB  is \na functi on of both the input code and I OUTFS  and can be  \nexpressed as:  \n( )OUTFSI CODE DAC IOUTA × = 4096 /  (1) \n( )OUTFSI CODE DAC IOUTB × − = /4096 4095  (2) \nwhere DAC CODE  = 0 to 4095 (i.e., decimal representation).  \nAs mentioned previously, I OUTFS  is a function of the reference \ncurrent IREF, which is nominally set by a reference voltage, \nVREFIO, and external resistor, R SET. It can be expressed as:  \nREF OUTFS I I × =32  (3) \nwhere  \nSET REFIO REF R V I/=  (4) \nThe two current outputs will typically drive a resistive load  \ndirectly or via a transf ormer. If dc coupling is required, IOUTA \nand IOUTB should be directly connected to matching resistive loads, R\nLOAD, that are tied to analog common, ACOM. Note that \nRLOAD may represent the equivalent load resistance seen by \nIOUTA or IOUTB as would be the ca se in a doubly terminated \n50 Ω or 75 Ω cable. The single -ended voltage output appearing  \nat the IOUTA  and IOUTB  nodes is simply  \nLOAD OUTA R IOUTA V × =  (5) \nLOAD OUTB R IOUTB V × =  (6) \nNote that the full -scale value of VOUTA and VOUTB should not exceed  \nthe s pecified output compliance range to maintain spec ified \ndistortion and linearity performance.  ( )LOAD DIFF R IOUTB IOUTA V × − =  (7) \nSubstituting the values of IOUTA , IOUTB , IREF, and V DIFF can be \nexpressed as:  \n( ) { }\n( )REFIO SET LOADDIFF\nV R RCODE DAC V\n× ×− × =\n/ 324096 / 4095 2\n (8) \nEquations 7 and 8 highlight s ome of the advantages of opera ting \nthe AD9742 differentially. First, the differential operation helps cancel common -mode error sources associated with IOUTA \nand IOUTB, such as noise, distortion, and dc offsets. Second, \nthe differential code -dependent current and subsequent voltage, \nV\nDIFF, is twice the value of the single-ended voltage ou tput (i.e., \nVOUTA or V OUTB), thus providing twice the signal power to the load.  \nNote that the gain drift temperature performance for a single-\nended (V OUTA and V OUTB) or diff erential output (V DIFF) of the \nAD9742 can be enhanced by selecting temperature tracking resistors for R\nLOAD and R SET due to their ratiometric relationship, \nas shown in Equation 8.  \nANALOG OUTPUTS  \nThe complementary current outputs in each DAC, IOUTA, \nand IOU TB may be configured for single -ended or differential \noperation. IOUTA and IOUTB can be converted into compl e-\nmentary single -ended voltage outputs, V OUTA and V OUTB, via a \nload resistor, R LOAD, as described in the DAC Transfer Function  \nsection by Equations 5 through 8. The differential voltage, V DIFF, \nexisting between V OUTA and V OUTB, can also be converted to a \nsingle- ended voltage via a transformer or differential amplifier \nconfiguration. The ac performance of the AD9742 is optimum and \nspecified using a differential transformer -coupled output in which  \nthe voltage swing at IOUTA and IOUTB is limited to ± 0.5 V .  \nThe distortion and noise performance of the AD9742 can be \nenhanced when it is configured for differential operation. The commo n-mode error sources of both IOUTA and IOUTB can \nbe significantly reduced by the common -mode rejection of a \ntransformer or differential amplifier. These common -mode \nerror sources include even -order distortion products and noise. \nThe enhancement in distortion performance becomes more significant as the frequency content of the reconstructed waveform increases and/or its amplitude decreases. This is due \nto the first -order cancellation of various dynamic common -\nmode distortion mechanisms, digital feedthrough, and noise. \nPerforming a differential -to-single- ended conversion via a \ntransformer also provides the ability to deliver twice the \nreco nstructed signal power to the load (assuming no source \ntermin ation). Since the output currents of IOUTA and IOUTB \nare compl ementary, they become additive when processed \ndifferentially. A properly selected transformer will allow the \nAD9742 to provide the required power and voltage levels to \ndifferent loads.  \n \n \nAD9742 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 14 of 32 The output impedance of IOUTA and IOUTB is determined by \nthe equivalent parallel combination of the PMOS switches asso ciated with the current sources and is typically 100 k Ω in \npara llel with 5 pF. It is also slightly dependent on the output \nvoltage (i.e., V\nOUTA and V OUTB) due to the nature of a PMOS \ndevice. As a result, maintaining IOUTA and/or IOUTB at a virtual ground via an I -V op amp configuration will result in \nthe opt imum dc linearity. Note that the INL/DNL specifications \nfor the AD9742 are measured with IOUTA maintained at a virtual ground via an op amp.  \nIOUTA and IOUTB also have a negative and positive voltage compliance range that must be adhered to in order to achie ve \noptimum performance. The negative output compliance range of −1 V is set by the breakdown limits of the CMOS process. \nOperation beyond this maximum limit may result in a brea kdown  \nof the output stage and affect the reliability of the AD9742.  \nThe positive output compliance range is slightly dependent on the full -scale output current, I\nOUTFS . It degrades slightly from its \nnominal 1.2 V for an I OUTFS  = 20 mA to 1 V for an I OUTFS  = 2 mA. \nThe optimum distortion performance for a single -ended or \ndifferential output is achieved when the maximum full -scale \nsignal at IOUTA a nd IOUTB does not exceed 0.5 V .  \nDIGITAL INPUTS  \nThe AD9742 digital section consists of 12 input bit channels \nand a clock input. The 12 -bit parallel data inputs follow stan dard \npositive binary coding, where DB11 is the most significant bit \n(MSB) and DB0 is t he least significant bit (LSB). IOUTA produces \na full -scale output current when all data bits are at Logic 1. IOUTB  \nproduces a complementary output with the full -scale current \nsplit between the two outputs as a function of the input code.  \nDVDD\nDIGITAL\nINPUT\n02912-B-024 \nFigure 25. Equivalent Digital Input  \nThe digital interface is implemented using an edge -triggered \nmaster/slave latch. The DAC output updates on the rising edge of the clock and is designed to support a clock rate as high as 210 MSPS. The clock can  be operated at any duty cycle that meets  \nthe specified latch pulse width. The setup and hold times can also be varied within the clock cycle as long as the specified minimum times are met, although the location of these transition  edges may affect digital  feedthrough and distortion \nperformance. Best performance is typically achieved when the \ninput data trans itions on the falling edge of a 50% duty cycle clock.  \n \n \n  CLOCK INPUT  \nSOIC/TSSOP Packages  \nThe 28 -lead package options have a single- ended clock input \n(CLOCK) that must be driven to rail -to-rail CMOS levels. The \nquality of the DAC output is directly related to the clock quality, \nand jitter is a key concern. Any noise or jitter in the clock will \ntranslate directly into the DAC output. Optimal performance will be achieved if the CLOCK input has a sharp rising edge, \nsince the DAC latches are positive edge triggered.  \nLFCSP Package  \nA configurable clock input is available in the LFCSP package, \nwhich allows for one single -ended and two differential modes. \nThe mod e selection is controlled by the CMODE input, as \nsummarized in Table 7 . Connecting CMODE to CLKCOM \nselects the single -ended clock input. In this mode, the CLK+ \ninput is driven with rail -to-rail swings and the CLK− input is \nleft flo ating. If CMODE is connected to CLKVDD, the differen tial \nreceiver mode is selected. In this mode, both inputs are high \nimpedance. The final mode is selected by floating CMODE. This  \nmode is also differential, but internal terminations for positive emitter -coupled logic (PECL) are activated. There is no significant  \nperformance difference between any of the three clock input modes.  \nTable 7. Clock Mode Selection  \nCMODE Pin  Clock Input Mode  \nCLKCOM  Single -Ended  \nCLKVDD  Differential  \nFloat  PECL  \nThe single -ended input mode operates in the same way as the \nCLOCK input in the 28 -lead packages, as described previously.  \nIn the differential input mode, the clock input functions as a high impedance differential pair. The common -mode level o f \nthe CLK+ and CLK − inputs can vary from 0.75 V to 2.25 V , and \nthe differential voltage can be as low as 0.5 V p -p. This mode \ncan be used to drive the clock with a differential sine wave since the high gain bandwidth of the differential inputs will convert \nthe sine wave int o a single -ended square wave internally.  \nThe final clock mode allows for a reduced external component \ncount when the DAC clock is distributed on the board using PECL logic. The internal termination configuration is shown in Figure 26. These termination resistors are untrimmed and can \nvary up to ± 20%. However, matching between the resistors \nshould generally be better than ±1%. \nCLK+\nTO DAC CORECLK–\nVTT = 1.3V NOM50Ω 50ΩAD9742\nCLOCK\nRECEIVER\n02912-B-025 \nFigure 26.

C | Page 15 of 32 DAC TIMING  \nInput Clock and Data Timing Relationship  \nDynamic performance in a DAC is dependent on the relatio nship \nbetween the position of the clock edges and the time at which \nthe input data changes. The AD9742 is rising edge triggered, \nand so exhibits dynamic performance sensitivity when the  data \ntransition is close to this edge. In general, the goal when applying  \nthe AD9742 is to make the data transition close to the falling \nclock edge. This becomes more important as the sample rate increases. Figure 27 shows the rel ationship of SFDR to clock \nplacement with different sample rates. Note that at the lower sample rates, more tolerance is allowed in clock plac ement, \nwhile at higher rates, more care must be taken.  \n–3 –2 2 –1 0 16575\nnsdB\n355\n45\n356070\n50\n40\n50MHz SFDR20MHz SFDR\n50MHz SFDR\n02912-B-026 \nFigure 27.

This mode c an be activated by applying a Logic Le vel 1 \nto the SLEEP pin. The SLEEP pin logic threshold is equal to 0.5 Ω \nAVDD. This digital input also contains an active pull- down circuit \nthat ensures that the AD9742 remains enabled if this input is left disconnected . The AD9742 takes less than 50 ns to power \ndown and approximately 5 µ s to power back up.  \nPOWER DISSIPATION  \nThe power dissipation, P D, of the AD9742 is dependent on se veral \nfactors that include: \n• The power supply voltages (AVDD, CLKVDD, and DVDD)  \n• The full -scale current output I OUTFS  \n• The update rate f CLOCK  \n• The reconstructed digital input waveform  \n \n \n \n \n The power dissipation is directly proportional to the analog supply \ncurrent, I AVDD, and the digital supply current, I DVDD. IAVDD is directly  \nproportional to I OUTFS, as shown in Figure 28, and is insensitive to  \nfCLOCK .

C | Page 16 of 32 APPLYING THE AD9742  \nOutput Configurations  \nThe following sections illustrate some typical output configur ations  \nfor the AD9742. Unless otherwise noted, it is assumed that I OUTFS is \nset to a nominal 20 mA. For applications requiring the optimum  \ndynamic performance, a differential output configuration is \nsuggested. A differential output configuration may co nsist of \neither an RF transformer or a differential op amp configuration. The transformer configuration provides opt imum high frequency \nperformance and is recommended for any application  that allows \nac coupling. The differential op amp configuration is suitable for applications requiring dc co upling, a bipolar output, signal \ngain, and/or level shifting within the bandwidth of the chosen op amp.  \nA single -ended output is suitable for applications requiring a \nunipolar voltage output. A positive unipolar output voltage will result if IOUTA and/or IOUTB are connected to an appropr iately  \nsized load resistor, R\nLOAD, referred to  ACOM. This config uration \nmay be more suitable for a single -supply system requiring a  \ndc-coupled, ground -referred output voltage. Alter natively, an \namplifier could be configured as an I -V converter, thus conver ting \nIOUTA or IOUTB into a negative unipolar voltage. This \nconfiguration provides the best dc linearity since IOUTA or \nIOUTB is maintained at a virtual ground.  \nDIFFERENTIAL COUPLING USING A TRAN SFORMER  \nAn RF transformer can be used to perform a differential -to-single -\nended signal conversion, as shown  in Figure 31. A diffe rentially \ncoupled transformer output provides the optimum distortion \nperformance for output signals whose spectral con tent lies within  \nthe transformer’s pass band. An RF transformer, such as the Mini -Circuits T1–1T, provides excellent rejection of common -\nmode distortion ( that is , even -order harmonics) and noise over \na wide frequency range. It also provides electrical isolation and the ability to deliver twice the power to the load. Transformers with  \ndifferent i mpedance ratios may also be used  for impedance matching  \npurposes. Note that the transformer provides ac coupling  only.  \nRLOAD AD9742MINI-CIRCUITS\nT1-1T\nOPTIONAL R DIFFIOUTA\nIOUTB22\n21\n02912-B-030 \nFigure 31. Differential Output Using a Transformer  \nThe center tap on the primary side of the transformer must be connected to ACOM to provide the necessary dc current path for both IOUTA and IOUTB. The complementary voltages appearing at IOUTA and IOUTB (i.e., V\nOUTA and V OUTB) swing \nsymmetrically around ACOM and should be maintained with the specified output compl iance range of the AD9742. A diffe rential  \nresistor, R\nDIFF, may be inserted in applications where the output \nof the transformer is connected to the load, R LOAD, via a passive \nreconstruction filter or cable. R DIFF is determined by the \ntransformer’s impedance  ratio and provides the proper source termination that results in a low VSWR. Note that approximat ely \nhalf the signal power will be dissipated across R DIFF. \nDIFFERENTIAL COUPLING USING AN OP AMP  \nAn op amp can also be used to perform a differential -to-singl e-\nended conversion, as shown in Figure 32. The AD9742 is configured  \nwith two equal load resistors, R LOAD, of 25 Ω. The diffe rential \nvoltage developed across IOUTA and IOUTB is converted to a single- ended signal via the differential op amp configur ation. \nAn optional capacitor can be installed across IOUTA and IOUTB , \nforming a real pole in a low- pass filter. The addition of this \ncapacitor also enhances the op amp’s distortion perform ance by \npreventing the DAC’s high sl ewing output from ove rloading the \nop amp’s input.  \nAD9742\nIOUTA\nIOUTB\nCOPT500Ω\n225Ω\n225Ω\n500Ω\n25Ω 25ΩAD8047\n02912-B-03122\n21\n \nFigure 32. DC Differential Coupling Using an Op Amp  \nThe common -mode rejection of this configuration is typically \ndetermined by the resistor matching. In this circuit, the differen tial op amp circuit using the AD8047 is configured to \nprovide some additional signal gain. The op amp must operate \noff a dual supply since its output is approximately ± 1 V . A high \nspeed a mplifier capable of preserving the differential performance  \nof the AD 9742 while meeting other system level objectives (e.g., \ncost or power) should be selected. The op amp’s differential gain , \ngain setting resistor values, and full -scale output swing capabilities  \nshould all be considered when optimizing this cir cuit.  \nThe di fferential circuit shown in Figure 33 provides the nece ssary \nlevel shifting required in a single -supply system. In this case, \nAVDD, which is the positive analog supply for both the AD9742 and the op amp, is also use d to level shift the dif ferential output \nof the AD9742 to midsupply (i.e., AVDD/2). The AD8041 is a suitable op amp for this application.  \nAD9742\nIOUTA\nIOUTB\nCOPT500Ω\n225Ω\n225Ω\n1kΩ 25Ω 25ΩAD8041\n1kΩ\nAVDD22\n21\n02912-B-032 \nFigure 33.

C | Page 17 of 32 SINGLE -ENDED, UNBUFFERED VO LTAG E OUTPUT  \nFigure 34 shows the AD9742 configured to provide a unipolar \noutput range of approximately 0 V to 0.5 V for a doubly term inated  \n50 Ω cable since the nominal full -scale current, I OUTFS, of 20 mA \nflows through the equivalent R LOAD of 25 Ω. In this case, R LOAD \nrepresents the equivalent load resistance seen by IOUTA or \nIOUTB. The unused output (IOUTA or IOUTB) can be co nnected  \nto ACOM directly or via a matching R LOAD. Different values of \nIOUTFS and R LOAD can be selected as long as the positive compliance  \nrange is adhered to. One additional consideration in this mode is the integral nonlinearity (INL), discussed in the Analog Outputs \nsection. For optimum INL performance, the single -ended, b uffered  \nvoltage output configuration is su ggested.  \nAD9742\nIOUTA\nIOUTB50Ω\n25ΩVOUTA = 0V TO 0.5VIOUTFS = 20mA\n50Ω22\n21\n02912-B-033 \nFigure 34. 0 V to 0.5 V Unbuffered Voltage Output  \nSINGLE -ENDED, BUFFERED VOLT AGE OUTPUT \nCONFIGURATION \nFigure 35 shows a buffered single -ended output conf iguration \nin which the op amp U1 performs an I -V conversion on the \nAD9742 output current. U1 maintains IOUTA (or IOUTB) at a virtual ground, minimizing the nonlinear output impedance effect on the DAC’s INL performance as described in the Analog Outputs  section. Although this single -ended configur ation typically \nprovides the best dc linearity performance, its ac di stortion \nperformance at higher DAC update rates may be limited by U1’s \nslew rate capabilities. U1 provid es a negative unipolar output \nvoltage, and its full- scale output voltage is si mply the product of \nR\nFB and I OUTFS . The full- scale output should be set within U1’s \nvoltage output swing capabilities by scaling I OUTFS and/or R FB. An \nimprovement in ac distortio n performance may result with a \nreduced I OUTFS since U1 will be r equired to sink less signal current . \nAD9742\nIOUTA\nIOUTBCOPT\n200ΩU1 VOUT= IOUTFS× RFBIOUTFS = 10mARFB\n200Ω\n22\n21\n02912-B-034 \nFigure 35. Unipolar Buffered Voltage Output  \n \n \n \n \n POWER AND GROUNDING CONSIDERATIONS, \nPOWER SUPPLY REJECTI ON \nMany applications s eek high speed and high performance under \nless than ideal operating conditions. In these application circuits, \nthe implementation and construction of the printed circuit board is as important as the circuit design. Proper RF techniques must be used for dev ice selection, placement, and rou ting as \nwell as power supply bypassing and grounding to ensure optimum performance. Figure 40 to Figure 43 illustrate the \nrecommended printed circuit board ground, power, an d signal \nplane layouts implemented on the AD9742 eval uation board.  \nOne factor that can measurably affect system performance is the ability of the DAC output to reject dc variations or ac noise superimposed on the analog or digital dc power distribution. This is referred to as the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). \nFor dc variations of the power supply, the resulting performance of the DAC directly corresponds to a gain error associated with the DAC’s full -scale current, I\nOUTFS . AC noise on the dc supplies  \nis common in applications where the power distribution is generated by a switching power supply. Typically, switching \npower supply noise will occur over the spectrum from tens of kHz to several MHz. The PSRR versus frequency of the AD9742 AVDD supply over  this frequency range is shown in Figure 36. \nFREQUENCY (MHz)85\n40\n12 6 8 10 0PSRR (dB)80\n75\n70\n65\n60\n55\n50\n2 445\n02912-B-035 \nFigure 36. Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)  \nNote that the ratio in Figure 36 is calculated as amps out/volts \nin. Noise on the analo g power supply has the effect of modula ting \nthe internal switches, and therefore the output current. The voltage noise on AVDD, therefore, will be added in a nonlinear manner to the desired IOUT. Due to the relative different size of these switches, the PS RR is very code dependent. This can pr oduce  \na mixing effect that can modulate low frequency power supply noise to higher frequencies. Worst -case PSRR for either one of \nthe differential DAC outputs will occur when the full -scale current  \nis directed toward t hat output. As a result, the PSRR measurement  \nin Figure 36 represents a worst -case cond ition in which the \ndigital inputs remain static and the full -scale output current of \n20 mA is directed to the DAC output being measured.  \n \n \nAD9742 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 18 of 32 An e xample serves to illustrate the effect of supply noise on the \nanalog supply. Suppose a switching regulator with a switching \nfrequency of 250 kHz produces 10 mV of noise and, for simpli city’s \nsake (ignoring harmonics), all of this noise is concentrated at 250 kHz. To calculate how much of this undesired noise will \nappear as current noise superimposed on the DAC’s full -scale \ncurrent, I\nOUTFS, one must determine the PSRR in dB using Figure 36 \nat 250 kHz. To calculate the  PSRR for a given R LOAD, such that the \nunits of PSRR are converted from A/V to V/V , adjust the curve in Figure 36 by the scaling factor 20 Ω log (R\nLOAD). For instance, if \nRLOAD is 50 Ω , the PSRR is reduced by 34 dB (i.e., PSRR of the DAC \nat 250 kHz, which is 85 dB in Figure 36, becomes 51 dB V OUT/VIN). \nProper grounding and decoupling should be a primar y obje ctive in \nany high speed, high resolution system. The AD9742 features \nseparate analog and digital supplies and ground pins to optimize  \nthe management of analog and digital ground currents in a \nsystem. In general, AVDD, the analog supply, should be dec oupled  \nto ACOM, the analog common, as close to the chip as physically possible. Similarly, DVDD, the digital supply, should be decoupled  \nto DCOM as close to the chip as physically possible.  \nFor those applications that require a single 3.3 V supply for bot h \nthe analog and digital supplies, a clean analog supply may be generated using the circuit shown in Figure 37. The circuit co nsists \nof a differential LC filter with separate power supply and return lines. Lower noi se can be attained by using low ESR type \nelectrolytic and tantalum capacitors.  \n100µF\nELECT.0.1µFCER.TTL/CMOS\nLOGIC\nCIRCUITS\n3.3V\nPOWER SUPPLYFERRITE\nBEADS\nAVDD\nACOM10µF–22µF\nTANT.\n02912-B-036 \nFigure 37.
