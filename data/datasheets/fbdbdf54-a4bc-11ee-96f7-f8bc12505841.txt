The HFBR-0500Z series includes transmitters, \nreceivers, connectors, and cables specified for easy design. \nThis series of components is ideal for solving problems with \nvoltage isolation/insulation, EMI/RFI immunity, or data \nsecurity. The optical link design is simplified by the logic-\ncompatible receivers and complete specifications for each \ncomponent. The key optical and electrical parameters of \nlinks configured with the HFBR-0500Z family are fully \nguaranteed from 0° to 70°C.\nA wide variety of package configurations and connectors \nprovide the designer with numerous mechanical solutions to \nmeet application requirements. The transmitter and receiver \ncomponents have been designed for use in high-volume/\nlow-cost assembly processes such as auto-insertion and \nwave soldering.\nTransmitters incorporate a 660-nm LED. Receivers include \na monolithic DC-coupled, digital IC receiver with an open \ncollector Schottky output transistor. An internal pull-up \nresistor is available for use in the HFBR-25X1Z/2Z/4Z \nreceivers. A shield has been integrated into the receiver IC \nto provide additional, localized noise immunity.\nInternal optics have been optimized for use with 1-mm \ndiameter polymer optical fiber. Versatile Link specifications \nincorporate all connector interface losses. Therefore, optical \ncalculations for common link applications are simplified.Features\n\uf06eRoHS compliant\n\uf06eLow-cost fiber-optic components\n\uf06eEnhanced digital links: DC to 5 Mbaud\n\uf06eExtended distance links up to 120m at 40 Kbaud\n\uf06eLow-current link: 6-mA peak supply current\n\uf06eHorizontal and vertical mounting\n\uf06eInterlocking feature\n\uf06eHigh noise immunity\n\uf06eEasy connectoring: simplex, duplex, and latching \nconnectors\n\uf06eFlame retardant\n\uf06eTransmitters with a 660-nm red LED for easy visibility\n\uf06eCompatible with standard TTL circuitry\nApplications\n\uf06eReduction of lightning/voltage transient susceptibility\n\uf06eMotor controller triggering\n\uf06eData communications and local area networks\n\uf06eElectromagnetic compatibility (EMC) for regulated \nsystems such as FCC, VDE, and CSA\n\uf06eTempest-secure data processing equipment\n\uf06eIsolation in test and measurement instruments\n\uf06eError-free signaling for industrial and manufacturing \nequipment\n\uf06eAutomotive communications and control networks\n\uf06eNoise-immune communication in audio and video \nequipmentHFBR-0500Z Series \nVersatile Link Fiber-Optic Connection\n\nBroadcom AV02-1501EN\n2HFBR-0500Z Series  Data Sheet Versatile Link Fiber-Optic Connection\nHFBR-0500Z Series Part Number Guide\nLink Selection Guide\n(Links specified from 0°C to 70°C, for polymer optical fiber unless specified.)\nSignal Rate Distance (m) 25°C Distance (m) Transmitter Receiver\n40 Kbaud 120 110 HFBR-1523Z HFBR-2523Z\n1 Mbaud 20 10 HFBR-1524Z HFBR-2524Z\n1 Mbaud 55 45 HFBR-1522Z HFBR-2522Z\n5 Mbaud 30 20 HFBR-1521Z HFBR-2521Z        HFBR X5XXZ               \n1 = Transmitter \n2 = Receiver Z = RoHS-compliant    \n5 = 660 nm Transmitter and \n   Receiver Products 1 = 5 MBd High Performance Link 2 = 1 MBd High Performance Link 3 = 40 kBd Low Current/Extended Distance Link2 = Horizontal Package 4 = 1 MBd Standard Link3 = Vertical Package 6 = 155 MBd Receiver 7 = 155 MBd Transmitter\n 8 = 10 MBd High Performance Link\nHFBR-0500Z Series  Data Sheet Versatile Link Fiber-Optic Connection\nBroadcom AV02-1501EN\n3Application Literature\nVersatile Link Family: Application Note 1035  (AV02-\n0730EN).\nPackage and Handling Information\nThe compact Versatile Link package is made of a flame-\nretardant VALOX UL 94 V-0 material (UL file # E121562) \nand uses the same pad layout as a standard, 8-pin dual-\ninline package. Vertical and horizontal mountable parts are \navailable. These low-profile Versatile Link packages are \nstackable and are enclosed to provide a dust-resistant seal. \nSnap action simplex, simplex latching, duplex, and duplex \nlatching connectors are offered with simplex or duplex \ncables.\nPackage Orientation\nPerformance and pinouts for the vertical and horizontal \npackages are identical. To provide additional attachment \nsupport for the vertical Versatile Link housing, the designer \nhas the option of using a self-tapping screw through a \nprinted circuit board into a mounting hole at the bottom of \nthe package. For most applications, this option is not \nnecessary.\nPackage Housing Color\nVersatile Link components and simplex connectors are \ncolor coded to eliminate confusion when making \nconnections. Receivers are blue, and transmitters are gray, \nexcept for the HFBR-15X3Z transmitter, which is black.Handling\nVersatile Link components are auto-insertable. When wave \nsoldering is performed with Versatile Link components, the \noptical port plug should be left in to prevent contamination of \nthe port. Do not use reflow solder processes (for example, \ninfrared reflow or vapor-phase reflow). Nonhalogenated \nwater-soluble fluxes (for example, 0% chloride), not rosin-\nbased fluxes, are recommended for use with Versatile Link \ncomponents.\nVersatile Link components are moisture sensitive devices \nand are shipped in a moisture sealed bag. If the \ncomponents are exposed to air for an extended period of \ntime, they may require a baking step before the soldering \nprocess. Refer to the special labeling on the shipping tube \nfor details.\nRecommended Chemicals for \nCleaning and Degreasing\n\uf06eAlcohols: methyl, isopropyl, isobutyl \n\uf06eAliphatics: hexane, heptane \n\uf06eOther: soap solution, naphtha\nDo not use partially halogenated hydrocarbons, such as \n1,1,1 trichloroethane, or ketones, such as MEK, acetone, \nchloroform, ethyl acetate, methylene dichloride, phenol, \nmethylene chloride, or N-methylpyrolldone. Also, Broadcom \ndoes not recommend the use of cleaners that use \nhalogenated hydrocarbons because of their potential \nenvironmental harm.\nHFBR-0500Z Series  Data Sheet Versatile Link Fiber-Optic Connection\nBroadcom AV02-1501EN\n4Mechanical Dimensions\nHorizontal Modules Vertical Modules\n6.86\n(0.270)\n10.16\n(0.400)\n4.19\n(0.165)\n1.27\n(0.050)\n2.54\n(0.100)0.51\n(0.020)18.8\n(0.74)2.03\n(0.080)\n7.62\n(0.30)0.64\n(0.025)\n7.62\n(0.300)\n2.77\n(0.109)1.85\n(0.073)0.64 (0.025) DIA.5.08\n(0.200)\n3.81 (0.150) MAX.\n3.56 (0.140) MIN.\n\nBroadcom AV02-1501EN\n5HFBR-0500Z Series  Data Sheet Versatile Link Fiber-Optic Connection\nVersatile Link Printed Board Layout Dimensions\nHorizontal Module Vertical Module\n4 1 3 2\n5 87.62\n(0.300)1.01 (0.040) DIA.\n1.85\n(0.073)MIN.PCB EDGETOP VIEW2.54\n(0.100)7.62\n(0.300)\nDIMENSIONS IN MILLIMETERS (INCHES).\n\nBroadcom AV02-1501EN\n6HFBR-0500Z Series  Data Sheet Versatile Link Fiber-Optic Connection\nInterlocked (Stacked) Assemblies\nHorizontal packages may be stacked by placing units with pins facing upward. Initially engage the interlocking mechanism \nby sliding the L bracket body from above into the L slot body of the lower package. Use a straight edge, such as a ruler, to \nbring all stacked units into uniform alignment. This technique prevents potential harm that could occur to fingers and hands \nof assemblers from the package pins. Stacked horizontal packages can be disengaged if necessary. Repeated stacking and \nunstacking causes no damage to individual units.\nTo stack vertical packages, hold one unit in each hand, with the pins facing away and the optical ports on the bottom. Slide \nthe L bracket unit into the L slot unit. The straight edge used for horizontal package alignment is not needed.\nIt is recommended to interlock (stack) no more than four compatible housings together.\nFigure 1:  Interlocked (Stacked) Horizontal or Vertical Packages\nStacking Horizontal Modules Stacking Vertical Modules\n\nBroadcom AV02-1501EN\n7HFBR-0500Z Series  Data Sheet Versatile Link Fiber-Optic Connection\n5-Mbaud Link (HFBR-15X1Z/25X1Z)\nSystem performance 0°C to 70°C, unless otherwise specified.\nFigure 2:  Typical 5-Mbaud Interface CircuitParameter Symbol Min.
