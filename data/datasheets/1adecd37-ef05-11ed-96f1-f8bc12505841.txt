This\ntransceiver hasanactive-HIGH driver enable and active-LOW receiver enable. The differential driver issuitable\nfordata transmission upto250kbps.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nFigure 13.Functional Logic Diagram\n8.3 Feature Description\nIntegrated transient voltage suppressors protect thetransceiver against Electrostatic Discharges (ESD) according\ntoIEC61000-4-2 ofupto±30kVandsurge transients according toIEC61000-4-5 ofupto400-W peak.\nThe differential driver incorporates slew-rate controlled outputs sufficient totransmit data upto250 kbps. Slew-\nrate control allows forlonger unterminated cable runs and longer stub lengths from themain cable trunk than\nwith faster voltage transitions. Aunique receiver design provides ahigh level failsafe output when theinputs are\nleftfloating.\nThe SN65LBC184 ischaracterized from –40°Cto85°CandtheSN75LBC184 ischaracterized from 0°Cto70°C.\n12 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1996 –2015, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LBC184 SN75LBC184\nSN65LBC184 ,SN75LBC184\nwww.ti.com SLLS236I –OCTOBER 1996 –REVISED JUNE 2015\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nWhen thedriver enable pin(DE) islogic high, thedifferential outputs AandBfollow thelogic states atdata input\nD.Alogic high atDcauses Atoturn high andBtoturn low.

TI’scustomers are\nresponsible fordetermining suitability ofcomponents fortheir purposes. Customers should\nvalidate andtesttheir design implementation toconfirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN65LBC184 and SN75LBC184 devices are half-duplex, RS-485 transceivers commonly used for\nasynchronous data transmissions. The driver and receiver enable pins allow fortheconfiguration ofdifferent\noperating modes.\nFigure 15.Half-Duplex Transceiver Configurations\na.Using independent enable lines provides themost flexible control asitallows forthedriver andthereceiver\ntobeturned onand offindividually. While thisconfiguration requires twocontrol lines, itallows forselective\nlistening intothebustraffic, whether thedriver istransmitting data ornot.\nb.Combining theenable signals simplifies theinterface tothecontroller byforming asingle direction-control\nsignal. Inthisconfiguration, thetransceiver operates asadriver when thedirection-control lineishigh, and\nasareceiver when thedirection-control lineislow.\nc.Only onelineisrequired when connecting thereceiver-enable input toground andcontrolling only thedriver-\nenable input. Inthisconfiguration, anode notonly receives thedata from thebus, butalso thedata itsends\nandcanverify thatthecorrect data have been transmitted.\n9.2 Typical Application\nAnRS-485 bus consists ofmultiple transceivers connected inparallel toabus cable. Toeliminate line\nreflections, each cable endisterminated with atermination resistor, RT,whose value matches thecharacteristic\nimpedance, Z0,ofthecable. This method, known asparallel termination, allows forhigher data rates over a\nlonger cable length.\nCopyright ©1996 –2015, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LBC184 SN75LBC184\n10000\n1000\n100\n10Cable Length (ft)\n100 1k 10k 100k 1M 10M 100M\nData Rate (bps)Conservative\nCharacteristics5%, 10%, and 20% Jitter\nRT RT\nRA B\nR RE DE DDRA B\nR RE DE DDR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nBR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nB\nSN65LBC184 ,SN75LBC184\nSLLS236I –OCTOBER 1996 –REVISED JUNE 2015 www.ti.com\nTypical Application (continued)\nFigure 16.Typical RS-485 Network With Half-Duplex Transceivers\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nRS-485 isarobust electrical standard suitable forlong-distance networking thatmay beused inawide range of\napplications with varying requirements, such asdistance, data rate, andnumber ofnodes.\n9.2.1.1 Data Rate and Bus Length\nThere isaninverse relationship between data rate andbuslength, meaning thehigher thedata rate, theshorter\nthecable length; and conversely, thelower thedata rate, thelonger thecable may bewithout introducing data\nerrors. While most RS-485 systems usedata rates between 10kbps and 100 kbps, some applications require\ndata rates upto250 kbps atdistances of4000 feet and longer. Longer distances arepossible byallowing for\nsmall signal jitter ofupto5or10%.\nFigure 17.Cable Length vsData Rate Characteristic\n16 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©1996 –2015, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LBC184 SN75LBC184\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n40 80 20 60 100 0\nTime - µsV(t) / VP1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\nTime - µsI(t) / IP\n20 40 10 30 50\nSN65LBC184 ,SN75LBC184\nwww.ti.com SLLS236I –OCTOBER 1996 –REVISED JUNE 2015\nTypical Application (continued)\n9.2.1.2 Stub Length\nWhen connecting anode tothebus, thedistance between thetransceiver inputs andthecable trunk, known as\nthestub, should beasshort aspossible.

Asageneral guideline, theelectrical length, orround-trip delay, of\nastub should beless than one-tenth oftherisetime ofthedriver, thus giving amaximum physical stub length as\nshown inEquation 1.\nL(STUB)≤0.1×tr×v×c\nwhere\n•tristhe10/90 risetime ofthedriver\n•visthesignal velocity ofthecable ortrace asafactor ofc\n•cisthespeed oflight (3×108m/s) (1)\nPerEquation 1,cable-stub lengths when using theSN65LBC184 driver must benotgreater than 5.85 meters (19\nfeet) forasignal velocity of78% andminimum driver output riseorfalltime of250ns.\n9.2.1.3 Bus Loading\nThe RS-485 standard specifies that acompliant driver must beable todriver 32unitloads (UL), where 1unit\nload represents aload impedance ofapproximately 12kΩ.Because theSN65LBC184 isa1/4ULtransceiver, it\nispossible toconnect upto128receivers tothebus.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n9.2.2.1 SN65LBC184 Test Description\nThe SN65LBC184 istested against theIEC 61000-4-5 recommended transient identified asthecombination\nwave.

High frequency currents follow thepath ofleast\ninductance andnotthepath ofleast impedance.\n•Apply 100-nF to220-nF bypass capacitors asclose aspossible totheVCCpins oftransceiver, UART, or\ncontroller ICsontheboard.\n•Use atleast two vias forVCCand ground connections ofbypass capacitors tominimize effective via-\ninductance.\n•Use 1-kΩto10-kΩpullup orpulldown resistors forenable lines tolimit noise currents inthese lines during\ntransient events.\n11.2 Layout Example\nFigure 21.Layout Schematic\nCopyright ©1996 –2015, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LBC184 SN75LBC184\nSN65LBC184 ,SN75LBC184\nSLLS236I –OCTOBER 1996 –REVISED JUNE 2015 www.ti.com\n12Device andDocumentation Support\n12.1 Related Links\nThe table below lists quick access links.
