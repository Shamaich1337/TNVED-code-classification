(In order to satisfy the supplying stability, management \noptimization and the best product performance...etc, under the premise of not affec ting the \nelectrical character istics and external dimensions,  Raystar  have the right to modify the \nversion.)  \n(10) Raystar  has the right to upgrade or modify the product function . \n(11) For COG & COF structure OLED products, customers should reserve VCC (VPP) adjustmen t \nfunction or software update function when designing OLED supporting circuit. (The progress \nof OLED light -emitting materials will increase the conversion efficiency and the brightness. \nThe brightness can be adjusted if necessary).  \n \n11.1. Handling Precautions  \n(1) Since the display panel is being made of glass, do not apply mechanical impacts such as \ndropping from a high position.  \n(2) If the display panel is broken by some accident and the internal organic substance leaks out, \nbe careful not to inhale nor li ck the organic substance.  \n(3) If pressure is applied to the display surface or its neighborhood of the OLED display module, \nthe cell structure may be damaged . So, be careful not to apply pressure to these sections.  \n(4) The polarizer covering the surface of the OLE D display module is soft and easily scratched.  \n(5) When the surface of the polarizer of the OLED display module has soil, clean the surface. It  \ntakes advantage  by using following adhesion tape.  \n* Scotch Mending Tape No. 810 or an equivalent  \nNever try to breat he upon the soiled surface nor wipe the surface using cloth containing \nsolvent  such as ethyl alcohol, since the surface of the polarizer will become cloudy.  \nAlso, pay attention that the following liquid and solvent may spoil the polarizer:  \n* Water  \n* Ketone  \n* Aromatic Solvents  \n(6) Protection film is being applied to the surface of the display panel and removes the protection \nfilm before assembling it. At this time, if the OLED display module has been stored for a long \nperiod of time, residue adhesive material of  the protection film may remain on the  surface of \nthe display panel after removed of the film. In such case, remove the residue  material by the \nmethod introduced in the above Section 5.  \n(7) Do not touch the following sections whenever possible while handling t he OLED display \n \n    \n \n \nPage 25 , Total 28 Pages  modules.  \n* Pins and electrodes  \n* Pattern layouts such as the TCP & FPC  \n(8) Hold OLED display module very carefully when placing OLED display module into the  \nSystem housing. Do not apply excessive stress or pressure to OLED display module. And, \ndo not over bend the film with electrode pattern layouts.  These stresses will influence the \ndisplay performance. Also, secure sufficient rigidity for the  outer cases.  \n \n(9) Do not apply stress to the LSI chips and the surrounding molded sections.  \n(10) Pay sufficien t attention to the working environments when handing OLED display  modules \nto prevent occurrence of element breakage accidents by static electricity.  \n* Be sure to make human body grounding when handling OLED display modules.  \n* Be sure to ground tools to use  or assembly such as soldering irons.  \n* To suppress generation of static electricity, avoid carrying out assembly work under dry \nenvironments.  \n* Protective film is being applied to the surface of the display panel of the OLED display  \nmodule. Be careful since static electricity may be generated when exfoliating the protective  \nfilm. \n \n11.2. Storage Precautions  \n(1) When storing OLED display modules, put them in static electricity preventive bags to avoid \nbe directly exposed to sun or lights of fluorescent lamps.  And, also, place in the temperature \n25±5°C and Humidity below 65% RH.(We recommend you to store these modules in the \npackaged state when they were shipped from Raystar . At that time, be careful not to let water \ndrops adhere to the packages or bags.)  \n \n(2) When the OLED display module is being dewed or when it is placed under  high temperature \nor high humidity environments, the electrodes may be corroded if electric current is applied . \nPlease stor e it in clean environment.  \n \n11.3. Designing Precautions  \n(1) The absolute maximum ratings are the ratings which cannot be exceeded for OLED  display \nmodule, and if these values are exceeded, OLED  display module may be damage d. \n(2) To prevent occurrence of malfunctioning by noise, pay attention to satisfy the VIL and VIH  \nspecification and to make the signal line cable as short as possible.  \n(3) We recommend you to install excess current preventive unit (fuses, etc.) to the power  circuit \n(VDD  / VCC ). (Recommend value: 0.5A)  \n(4) Pay sufficient attention to avoid occurrence of mutual nois e interference with the  nearby \ndevices.  \n\n \n    \n \n \nPage 26 , Total 28 Pages  (5) As for EMI, take necessary measures on the equipment side basically.  \n(6) If the power suppl ied to the OLED display module is forcibly shut down by such errors as \ntaking  out the main battery while the OLED display panel i s in operation, we cannot \nguarantee the  quality of this OLED display module.  \n* Connection (contact) to any other potential than the above may lead to rupture of the IC.  \n(7) If this OLED driver is exposed to light, malfunctioning may occur  and s emiconductor \nelements may change their characteristics.  \n(8) The internal status may be changed, if excessive external noise  enters into the module.   \nTherefore , it is necessary to take appropriate measures to suppress noise generation or to \nprotect module from influences of n oise on the system design.  \n(9) We recommend you to make periodical refreshment of the operation statuses (re -setting of \nthe commands and re -transference of the display data) to cope with catastrophic noise.  \n(10) It\'s pretty common to use "Screen Saver" to extend the lifetime and Don\'t use the same  \nimage for long time in real application. When an OLED display module is operated for a long \nof time with fixed pattern , an afterimage or slight contrast deviation may oc cur. \n(11) The limitation of FPC and Film bending . \n \n \n(12) The module should be fixed balanc ed into the housing, or the module may be twisted.  \n \n(13) Please heat up a little the tape sticking on the components when removing it; otherwise the \ncomponents might be damaged.  \n \n \n11.4. Precautions when disposing of the OLED display modules  \n(1) Request the qualified companies to handle industrial wastes when disposing of the OLED \ndisplay modules. Or, when burning them, be sure to observe the environmental and hygienic \nlaws and regulations.  \n0.1(0.1 Max.)\n \n    \n \n \nPage 27 , Total 28 Pages  Page: 1  \nModule Sample Estimate Feedback Sheet  \nModule Number ：                                              \n \n1、Panel Specification ： \n  1.
