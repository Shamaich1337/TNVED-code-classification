Each gate performs the Boolean function\nY =  A ● B ● C ● D in positive logic.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nxA\nxB\nxY\nxC\nxD\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Balanced CMOS Push-Pull Outputs\nA balanced output allows the device to sink and source similar currents. The drive capability of this device\nmay create fast edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing.\nAdditionally, the outputs of this device are capable of driving larger currents than the device can sustain without\nbeing damaged. It is important for the output power of the device to be limited to avoid damage due to\nover-current. The electrical and thermal limits defined in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  must be followed at all\ntimes.\nThe SN74HC20 can drive a load with a total capacitance less than or equal to the maximum load listed in\nthe Switching Characteristics - 74  connected to a high-impedance CMOS input while still meeting all of the\ndatasheet specifications. Larger capacitive loads can be applied, however it is not recommended to exceed the\nprovided load value. If larger capacitive loads are required, it is recommended to add a series resistor between\nthe output and the capacitor to limit output current to the values given in the Absolute Maximum Ratings .\n8.3.2 Standard CMOS Inputs\nStandard CMOS inputs are high impedance and are typically modeled as a resistor from the input to ground\nin parallel with the input capacitance given in the Electrical Characteristics - 74 . The worst case resistance is\ncalculated with the maximum input voltage, given in the Absolute Maximum Ratings , and the maximum input\nleakage current, given in the Electrical Characteristics - 74 , using ohm\'s law (R = V ÷ I).\nSignals applied to the inputs need to have fast edge rates, as defined by the input transition time in the\nRecommended Operating Conditions  to avoid excessive current consumption and oscillations. If a slow or noisy\ninput signal is required, a device with a Schmitt-trigger input should be used to condition the input signal prior to\nthe standard CMOS input.www.ti.comSN74HC20, SN54HC20\nSCLS086G – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HC20  SN54HC20\n8.3.3 Clamp Diode Structure\nThe inputs and outputs to this device have both positive and negative clamping diodes as depicted in Figure 8-1 .\nCAUTION\nVoltages beyond the values specified in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  table can cause damage to\nthe device.

TI’s customers are responsible for\ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nIn this application, two 4-input NAND gates are used to create an active-low SR latch as shown in Figure 9-1 .\nUnused inputs can be tied together or to V CC\nThis device is used to drive the tamper indicator LED and provide one bit of data to the system controller.\nWhen the tamper switch outputs LOW, the output Q becomes HIGH. This output remains HIGH until the system\ncontroller addresses the event and sends a LOW signal to the R input which returns the Q output back to LOW.\n9.2 Typical Application\nSystem\nController\nTamper\nSwitch 1R\nSAQR1\nTamper\nIndicatorR2\nSC Tamper\nSwitch 3SB\nFigure 9-1.

The\nsupply voltage sets the device\'s electrical characteristics as described in the Electrical Characteristics - 74 .\nThe supply must be capable of sourcing current equal to the total current to be sourced by all outputs of the\nSN74HC20 plus the maximum supply current, I CC, listed in the Electrical Characteristics - 74 . The logic device\ncan only source or sink as much current as it is provided at the supply and ground pins, respectively. Be sure not\nto exceed the maximum total current through GND or V CC listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nTotal power consumption can be calculated using the information provided in CMOS Power Consumption and\nCpd Calculation .\nThermal increase can be calculated using the information provided in Thermal Characteristics of Standard Linear\nand Logic (SLL) Packages and Devices .www.ti.comSN74HC20, SN54HC20\nSCLS086G – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HC20  SN54HC20\nCAUTION\nThe maximum junction temperature, T J(max) listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings , is an\nadditional limitation  to prevent damage to the device. Do not violate any values listed in the Absolute\nMaximum Ratings . These limits are provided to prevent damage to the device.\n9.2.1.2 Input Considerations\nUnused inputs must be terminated to either V CC or ground. These can be directly terminated if the input is\ncompletely unused, or they can be connected with a pull-up or pull-down resistor if the input is to be used\nsometimes, but not always. A pull-up resistor is used for a default state of HIGH, and a pull-down resistor is\nused for a default state of LOW. The resistor size is limited by drive current of the controller, leakage current into\nthe SN74HC20, as specified in the Electrical Characteristics - 74 , and the desired input transition rate. A 10-k Ω\nresistor value is often used due to these factors.\nThe SN74HC20 has standard CMOS inputs, so input signal edge rates cannot be slow. Slow input edge\nrates can cause oscillations and damaging shoot-through current. The recommended rates are defined in the\nRecommended Operating Conditions .\nRefer to Section 8.3  for additional information regarding the inputs for this device.\n9.2.1.3 Output Considerations\nThe positive supply voltage is used to produce the output HIGH voltage. Drawing current from the output will\ndecrease the output voltage as specified by the V OH specification in the Electrical Characteristics - 74 . Similarly,\nthe ground voltage is used to produce the output LOW voltage. Sinking current into the output will increase the\noutput voltage as specified by the V OL specification in the Electrical Characteristics - 74 .\nUnused outputs can be left floating. Do not connect outputs directly to V CC or ground.\nRefer to Section 8.3  for additional information regarding the outputs for this device.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1. Add a decoupling capacitor from V CC to GND. The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the\ndevice and electrically close to both the V CC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in Section 11 .\n2. Ensure the capacitive load at the output is ≤ 70 pF. This is not a hard limit, however it will ensure optimal\nperformance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the SN74HC20\nto the receiving device.\n3. Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (V CC / IO(max)) Ω. This will ensure that the maximum\noutput current from the Absolute Maximum Ratings is not violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load\nmeasured in megaohms; much larger than the minimum calculated above.\n4. Thermal issues are rarely a concern for logic gates, however the power consumption and thermal increase\ncan be calculated using the steps provided in the application report, CMOS Power Consumption and Cpd\nCalculation\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nQR\nS\n \nFigure 9-2.

Each V CC terminal should have a bypass capacitor to prevent power\ndisturbance. A 0.1- μF capacitor is recommended for this device. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass caps\nto reject different frequencies of noise. The 0.1- μF and 1- μF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The\nbypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results, as shown in\nFigure 11-1 .\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple-input and multiple-channel logic devices inputs must not ever be left floating. In many\ncases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused; for example, when only two inputs of\na triple-input AND gate are used. Such unused input pins must not be left unconnected because the undefined\nvoltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. All unused inputs of digital logic\ndevices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the input voltage specifications, to\nprevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular unused input depends on the\nfunction of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or V CC, whichever makes more sense for the logic\nfunction or is more convenient.\n11.2 Layout Example\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n714\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n81A\n1B\n1C\n1D\n1YGND V CC\n2D\n2C\n2B\n2A\n2Y GNDVCC\nNCNC0.1 \x1dF\nUnused inputs \ntied to V CCBypass capacitor \nplaced close to \nthe device\nAvoid 90°  \ncorners for \nsignal linesRecommend GND flood fill for \nimproved signal isolation, noise \nreduction, and thermal dissipation\nFigure 11-1.
