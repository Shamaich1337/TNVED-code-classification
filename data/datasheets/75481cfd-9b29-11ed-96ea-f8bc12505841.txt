[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a technical specialist with expertise in electronics. Your task is to analyze datasheets for electronic components and provide a concise summary of the product’s key characteristics and specifications. In addition, you need to gather textual information about the component, including its description and typical applications.Instructions:    Identify the correct component in the datasheet using the provided product code.    Summarize key parameters, including:        Voltage ratings        Current ratings        Power consumption        Operating temperature range        Package type        Special features or notes (if applicable)        Moisture Sensetive Level JEDEC J-STD-020E    Provide a short description of the component, including what it is (e.g., transistor, microcontroller, sensor) and its primary function.    Explain typical applications for the component (e.g., power management, signal processing, data storage, etc.).    Be thorough and accurate: Ensure the information corresponds specifically to the product code, as some datasheets cover multiple variants.Your goal is to create a clear and accurate technical summary that includes both key specifications and a description of what the component is used for.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Give me information about the component of CFR-50JT-52-15R production of YAGEO from the text:  \nProduct specification – August 13, 2021  V.0 \n  \n \n \n  \n無法顯示連結的圖像。檔案可能已移動、重新命名或刪除。請驗證連結指向正確的檔案及位置。\n  DATA SHEET\n \nCARBON FILM RESISTOR S\nGeneral Purpose\nCFR Series\n±2%,  ±5%  \n1/6W  to 3W\nRoHS compliant  & Halogen  Free\n \n\nwww.yageo.com\n Aug. 13, 2021   V.0  \n  \n Carbon Film Resistors\n    2 \n16 \n Product Specification\n CFR \n Through Hole Resistor s \n \n \n \n \nAPPLICATIONS  \n\uf09f All general purpose \napplications  \n\uf09f Power applications  \n \n \n \nFEATURES  \n\uf09f AEC-Q200 qualified  \n\uf09f Wide resistance range  \n\uf09f High stability  \n\uf09f PPAP ready \n(CFR -25/CFR50S)  \n\uf09f RoHS compliant & \nhalogen -free \n  \nORDERING  INFORMATION  \nPart number of the general purpose carbon  film resistor  are identified by \nthe series, power  rating , tolerance, packing , temperature coefficient, \nforming  and resistance value.  \n \nPART NUMBER  \n \nCFR    200     J    T    -    73-   100R  \n(1)       (2)      (3)    (4)   (5)    (6)     (7) \n(1) SERIES NAME  \nCFR Series  \n \n(2) POWER RATING  \n-12 = 1/6W  \n25S = 1/4W \n-25 = 1/4W \n50S = 1/2W \n -50 = 1/2W \n100 = 1W \n2WS  = 2W 200 = 2W \n3WS  = 3W \n1WS  = 1W \n(3) TOLERANCE  \nG = ±2% \n J = ±5% \n(4) PACKAGING  \nR = Reel Pack  \nT = Box Pack  B = Bulk \n \n \n(5) TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTANCE  \n- = Based on spec  , please refer to  page 4  Table 2  . \n \n(6) FORMING  \n26- = 26mm                          \n52- = 52.4mm                          \n73- = 73mm  \n73G = 73mm , Φd≧0.6mm                           \n26A = 26mm , Φd=0.4±0.02mm          \n26C = 26mm , Φd=0.5±0.02mm  \n26G = 26mm , ≧Φd 0.6mm  \n52A = 52.4mm , Φd=0.4±0.02mm  \n52B = 52.4mm , Φd=0.45±0.02mm           \n52C = 52.4mm , Φd=0.5±0.02mm  \n52G = 52.4mm , ≧Φd 0.6mm  M = M -Type Forming              \nMT = MT Type Forming  \nMB = M -form W/flat             \nFT = FT Type Forming  \nF = F Type                    \nFK = FK Type         \nFFK = F -form Kink                  \nFKK = FKK Type     \nPN = PANAsert                       \nAV = AVIsert  \n \n52H = 52.4mm , non-painting  on welding spot  \n \n(7) RESISTANCE VALUE  \nE24 Series  \nExample:  \n100R = 100Ω, 10K = 10,000 Ω, 1M = 1,000,000Ω    \n\nwww.yageo.com\n Aug. 13, 2021   V.0  \n  \n Carbon Film Resistors\n    3 \n16 \n Product Specification\n CFR \n Through Hole Resistor s \n \nDIMENSIONS  \nUnit: mm \n Normal  Miniature  L ψD H ψd \nCFR-12 CFR 25S 3.4 ± 0.3 1.9 ± 0.2 28 ± 2.0 0.45 ± 0.05  \nCFR -25 CFR 50S 6.3 ± 0.5 2.4 ± 0.2 28 ± 2.0 0.55 ± 0.05  \nCFR -50 CFR 1WS  9.0 ± 0.5 3.3 ± 0.3 26 ± 2.0 0.55 ± 0.05  \nCFR 100 CFR 2WS  11.5 ± 1.0 4.5 ± 0.5 35 ± 2.0 0.8 ± 0.05  \nCFR 200 CFR 3WS  15.5 ± 1.0  5.0 ± 0.5  33 ± 2.0 0.8 ± 0.05  \n \n \nDERATING CURVE  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS  \n \nTABLE 1  \nCHARACTERISTICS  CFR \n-12 CFR \n25S CFR \n-25 CFR \n50S CFR \n-50 CFR \n1WS  CFR \n100 CFR \n2WS  CFR \n200 CFR \n3WS  \nPower Rating  \nat 70 °C 1/6W  1/4W  1/4W  1/2W  1/2W  1W 1W 2W 2W 3W \nMaximum Working  \nVoltage  150V 200V  250V  300V  350V  400V  500V  500V  500V  500V  \nMaximum Overload  \nVoltage  300V 400V  500V  600V  700V  800V  1000V  1000V  1000V  1000V  \nVoltage Proof  on \nInsulation  300V  400V  500V  500V  500V  700V  1000V  1000V  1000V  1000V  \nResistance Range  1Ω ~ 10MΩ for E24 series value  \nOperating Temp.  \nRange  - 55°C to +155 °C  \nTemperature  \nCoefficient  see Table 2 \nNote: For resistance value out of above range is by request.  \n \n \nRated Power (%)100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n20 40 70 100 155\n  Ambient Temperature ( °C)\n \nwww.yageo.com\n Aug. 13, 2021   V.0  \n  \n Carbon Film Resistors\n    4 \n16 \n Product Specification\n CFR \n Through Hole Resistor s \n \nTABLE 2 TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT  \n \nTYPE   Temp.
