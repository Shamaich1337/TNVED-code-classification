It is very easy to apply. It requires a single supply  only \nbetween 2.7 V and 5.5 V , a  power supply decoupling capacitor , \nand an input coupling capacitor in most applications. The output is a linear -responding dc voltage with a conversion gain \nof 7.5 V/V rms. An external filter capacitor can be added to increase the averaging time constant.  \n \nFigure 1. Output in the Three Reference Modes, Supply 3 V, Frequency 1.9 GHz   \n(6-Lead SOT -23 Package Ground Reference Mode Only)  FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM S \n \nFigure 2. 8 -Lead MSOP  \n \nFigure 3. 6 -Lead SOT -23 \nThe AD8361 is intended for true power measurement of simple \nand complex waveforms. The device is particularly useful for measuring high crest -factor (high peak -to-rms ratio) signals, \nsuch as CDMA and W -CDMA.  \nThe AD8361 has three operating modes to accommodate a \nvariety of analog -to-digital converter requirements:  \n1. Ground reference mode, in which the origin is zero.  \n2. Internal reference mode, which offsets the output 350 mV \nabove ground.  \n3. Supply reference mode, which offsets the output to V\nS/7.5.  \nThe AD8361 is specified  for operation from −40°C to +85°C \nand is available in 8 -lead MSOP and 6 -lead SOT -23 packages. It \nis fabricated on a proprietary high f T silicon bipolar process. \n \n RFIN (V rms)3.0\n1.6\n0 0.5 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.42.6\n2.2\n2.0\n1.82.8\n2.4V rms (Volts)1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.60.8\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0SUPPLY\nREFERENCE MODE\nINTERNAL\nREFERENCE MODE\nGROUND\nREFERENCE MODE\n01088-C-001RFIN\nIREFPWDNVPOS\nFLTR\nSREFVRMS\nCOMMBAND-GAP\nREFERENCEERROR\nAMPAD8361INTERNAL FILTER\nADD\nOFFSETTRANS-\nCONDUCTANCE\nCELLSi\ni× 7.5\nBUFFERχ2\nχ2\n01088-C-002\nRFIN\nIREFPWDNVPOS\nFLTR\nVRMS\nCOMMBAND-GAP\nREFERENCEERROR\nAMPAD8361INTERNAL FILTER\nTRANS-\nCONDUCTANCE\nCELLSi\ni× 7.5\nBUFFERχ2\nχ2\n01088-C-003\nAD8361  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

F | Page 11 of 22 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8361 is an rms-responding (mean power) detector that \nprovides an approach to the exact measurement of RF power \nthat is basically independent of waveform. It achieves this function through the use of a proprietary technique in which \nthe outputs of two identical squaring cells are balanced by the \naction of a high-gain error amplifier. \nThe signal to be measured is applied to the input of the first \nsquaring cell, which presents a nominal (LF) resistance of 225 Ω between the RFIN and COMM pins (connected to the ground plane). Because the input pin is at a bias voltage of about 0.8 V above ground, a coupling capacitor is required. By making this \nan external component, the measurement range may be \nextended to arbitrarily low frequencies. \nThe AD8361 responds to the voltage, V\nIN, at its input by \nsquaring this voltage to generate a current proportional to V IN \nsquared. This is applied to an internal load resistor, across \nwhich a capacitor is connected. These form a low-pass filter, which extracts the mean of V\nIN squared. Although essentially \nvoltage-responding, the associated input impedance calibrates this port in terms of equivalent power. Therefore, 1 mW corresponds to a voltage input of 447 mV rms. The Application \nInformation section shows how to match this input to 50 Ω. \nThe voltage across the low-pass filter, whose frequency may be \narbitrarily low, is applied to one input of an error-sensing amplifier. A second identical voltage-squaring cell is used to close a negative \nfeedback loop around this error amplifier. This second cell is \ndriven by a fraction of the quasi-dc output voltage of the AD8361. When the voltage at the input of the second squaring cell is equal to the rms value of V\nIN, the loop is in a stable state, \nand the output then represents the rms value of the input. The feedback ratio is nominally 0.133, making the rms-dc \nconversion gain ×7.5, that is \nrms V VIN OUT\uf0b4 \uf03d5 . 7 \nBy completing the feedback path through a second squaring \ncell, identical to the one receiving the signal to be measured, \nseveral benefits arise. First, scaling effects in these cells cancel; thus, the overall calibration may be accurate, even though the open-loop response of the squaring cells taken separately need not be. Note that in implementing rms-dc conversion, no \nreference voltage enters into the closed-loop scaling. Second, \nthe tracking in the responses of the dual cells remains very close \nover temperature, leading to excellent stability of calibration. The squaring cells have very wide bandwidth with an intrinsic \nresponse from dc to microwave. However, the dynamic range of such a system is fairly small, due in part to the much larger dynamic range at the output of the squaring cells. There are \npractical limitations to the accuracy of sensing very small error \nsignals at the bottom end of the dynamic range, arising from small \nrandom offsets that limit the attainable accuracy at small inputs. \nOn the other hand, the squaring cells in the AD8361 have a \nClass-AB aspect; the peak input is not limited by their quiescent bias condition but is determined mainly by the eventual loss of square-law conformance. Consequently, the top end of their \nresponse range occurs at a fairly large input level (approximately \n700 mV rms) while preserving a reasonably accurate square-law response. The maximum usable range is, in practice, limited by the output swing. The rail-to-rail output stage can swing from a few millivolts above ground to less than 100 mV below the supply. An example of the output induced limit: given a gain of \n7.5 and assuming a maximum output of 2.9 V with a 3 V \nsupply, the maximum input is (2.9 V rms)/7.5 or 390 mV rms. \nFiltering \nAn important aspect of rms-dc conversion is the need for \naveraging (the function is root-MEAN-square ). For complex RF \nwaveforms, such as those that occur in CDMA, the filtering provided by the on-chip, low-pass filter, although satisfactory for CW signals above 100 MHz, is inadequate when the signal has modulation components that extend down into the \nkilohertz region. For this reason, the FLTR pin is provided: a \ncapacitor attached between this pin and VPOS can extend the \naveraging time to very low frequencies. \nOffset \nAn offset voltage can be added to the output (when using the \nMSOP version) to allow the use of ADCs whose range does not \nextend down to ground. However, accuracy at the low end degrades because of the inherent error in this added voltage. This requires that the IREF ( internal reference ) pin be tied to \nVPOS and SREF ( supply reference ) to ground. \nIn the IREF mode, the intercept is generated by an internal reference cell and is a fixed 350 mV , independent of the supply voltage. To enable this intercept, IREF should be open-circuited, \nand SREF should be grounded. \nIn the SREF mode, the voltage is provided by the supply. To \nimplement this mode, tie IREF to VPOS and SREF to VPOS. \nThe offset is then proportional to the supply voltage and is \n400 mV for a 3 V supply and 667 mV for a 5 V supply. \n  \n \nAD8361 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 12 of 22 APPLICATION INFORMATION \nBasic Connections \nFigure 36 through Figure 38 show  the basic connections for the \nAD8361’s MSOP version in its three operating modes. In all \nmodes, the device is powered by a single supply of between \n2.7 V and 5.5 V . The VPOS pin is decoupled using 100 pF and 0.01 μF capacitors. The quiescent current of 1.1 mA in operating mode can be reduced to 1 μA by pulling the PWDN \npin up to VPOS. \nA 75 Ω external shunt resistance combines with the ac-coupled \ninput to give an overall broadband input impedance near 50 Ω. \nNote that the coupling capacitor must be placed between the \ninput and the shunt impedance. Input impedance and input \ncoupling are discussed in more detail below. \nThe input coupling capacitor combines with the internal input \nresistance (Figure 37) to provide a high-pass corner frequency \ngiven by the equation \nIN CR Cf\uf0b4 \uf0b4\uf03dπ 21\ndB 3\n \nWith the 100 pF capacitor shown in Figure 36 through Figure 38, \nthe high-pass corner frequency is about 8 MHz. \n \nFigure 36. Basic Connections for Ground Reference Mode \n \n \nFigure 37. Basic Connections for Internal Reference Mode  \nFigure 38. Basic Connections for Supply Referenced Mode \nThe output voltage is nominally 7.5 times the input rms voltage \n(a conversion gain of 7.5 V/V rms). Three modes of operation are set by the SREF and IREF pins. In addition to the ground reference mode shown in Figure 36, where the output voltage swings from around near ground to 4.9 V on a 5.0 V supply, two additional modes allow an offset voltage to be added to the \noutput. In the internal reference mode (Figure 37), the output \nvoltage swing is shifted upward by an internal reference voltage of 350 mV . In supply referenced mode (Figure 38), an offset voltage of V\nS/7.5 is added to the output voltage. Table 4 \nsummarizes the connections, output transfer function, and minimum output voltage (i.e., zero signal) for each mode. \nOutput Swing \nFigure 39 shows the output swing of the AD8361 for a 5 V \nsupply voltage for each of the three modes. It is clear from Figure 39 that operating the device in either internal reference \nmode or supply referenced mode reduces the effective dynamic \nrange as the output headroom decreases. The response for lower supply voltages is similar (in the supply referenced mode, the offset is smaller), but the dynamic range reduces further as headroom decreases. Figure 40 shows the response of the \nAD8361 to a CW input for various supply voltages. \n \nFigure 39.

Output Swing for Supply Voltages of  \n2.7 V, 3.0 V, 5.0 V and 5.5 V (MSOP Only)  \nDynamic Range  \nBecause the AD8361 is a linear -responding device with a \nnominal transfer function of 7.5 V/V rms, the dynamic range in \ndB is not clear from plots such as Figure 39. As the input level is \nincreased in constant dB steps, the output step size (per dB) also \nincreases. Figure 41 shows the relati onship between the output \nstep size (i.e., mV/dB) and input voltage for a nominal transfer \nfunction of 7.5 V/V rms.  \nTable 4.

Idealized Output Step Size as a Function of Input Voltage  \nPlots of output voltage versus input voltage result in a straight line. It may sometimes be more useful to plot the error on a logarithmic scale, as shown in Figure 42. The deviation of the \nplot for the ideal straight line characteristic is caused by output clipping at the high end and by signal offsets at the low end. It should however be noted that offsets at the low end can be \neither positive or negative , so this plot could also trend upwards \nat the low end. Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 12, and Figure 13 \nshow a ±3 sigma distribution of the device error for a large \npopulation of devices.  \n \nFigure 42. Representative Unit, Error in dB vs. Input Level, V S = 2.7 V  \nIt is als o apparent in Figure 42 that the error plot tends to shift \nto the right with increasing frequency. Because the input impedance decreases with frequency, the voltage act ually \napplied to the input also tends to decrease (assuming a constant source impedance over frequency). The dynamic range is almost constant over frequency, but with a small decrease in conversion gain at high frequency.  \nInput Coupling and Matching  \nThe in put impedance of the AD8361 decreases with increasing \nfrequency in both its resistive and capacitive components (Figure 17). The resistive component varies from 225 Ω  at \n100 MHz down to about 95 Ω  at 2.5 GHz.  \nA number of options exist for input matching. For operation at \nmultiple frequencies, a 75 Ω  shunt to ground, as shown in \nFigure 43, provides the best overall match. For use at a single \nfrequency, a resistive or a reactive match can be used. By \nplotting the input impedance on a Smith Chart, the best value for a resistive m atch can be calculated. The VSWR can be held \nbelow 1.5 at frequencies up to 1 GHz, even as the input impedance varies from part to part. (Both input impedance and input capacitance can vary by up to ±20% around their nominal values.) At very high frequenci es (i.e., 1.8 GHz to 2.5 GHz), a \nshunt resistor is not sufficient to reduce the VSWR below 1.5. Where VSWR is critical, remove the shunt component and \ninsert an inductor in series with the coupling capacitor as \nshown in Figure 44. \nTable 5 gives recommended shunt resistor values for various \nfrequencies and series inductor values for high frequencies. The coupling capacitor, C\nC, essentially acts as an ac -short and plays \nno intent ional part in the matching.

A \nmethod for hand calculating the appropriate matching components \nis shown on page 12 of the AD8306 data sheet. \nMatching in this manner results in very small values for C M, \nespecially at high frequencies. As a result, a stray capacitance as \nsmall as 1 pF can significantly degrade the quality of the match. The main advantage of a reactive match is the increase in sensitivity that results from the input voltage being gained up \n(by the square root of the impedance ratio) by the matching \nnetwork. Table 6 shows the recommended values for reactive \nmatching. \n  \n \n Table 6.

A series \nresistor combines with the input impedance of the AD8361 to \nattenuate the input signal. Because this series resistor forms a divider with the frequency dependent input impedance, the apparent gain changes greatly with frequency. However, this method has the advantage of very little power being tapped off \nin RF power transmission applications. If the resistor is large \ncompared to the transmission line’s impedance, then the VSWR \nof the system is relatively unaffected. \n \nFigure 47. Input  Impedance vs. Frequency, Supply 3 V, SOT-23 \nSelecting the Filter Capacitor \nThe AD8361 ’s internal 27 pF filter capacitor is connected in \nparallel with an internal resistance that varies with signal level \nfrom 2 kΩ for small signals to 500 Ω for large signals. The \nresulting low-pass corner frequency between 3 MHz and \n12 MHz provides adequate filtering for all frequencies above 240 MHz (i.e., 10 times the frequency at the output of the squarer, which is twice the input frequency). However, signals with high peak-to-average ratios, such as CDMA or W-CDMA \nsignals, and low frequency components require additional \nfiltering. TDMA signals, such as GSM, PDC, or PHS, have a peak-to average ratio that is close to that of a sinusoid, and the \ninternal filter is adequate. \n AD8361RFIN RFIN\nRSH\n01088-C-043CC\nAD8361RFIN RFINLM\n01088-C-044CC\nAD8361RFIN RFIN\n01088-C-045CC CM\nLM\nAD8361RFIN RFIN\n01088-C-046CC RSERIES\nFREQUENCY (MHz)200\n0 500RESISTANCE ( \uf057)\n100\n0250\n150\n50\n1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 35000.20.50.81.11.41.7\nCAPACITANCE (pF)\n01088-C-047\nData Sheet AD8361\n \nRev.

Note that large filter capacitors increase the enable and \npulse response times, as discussed below. \nTable 7.

It is only \nnecessary to increase the input coupling capacitor to reduce the \ncorner frequency of the input high-pass filter (use an input \nresistance of 225 Ω for frequencies below 100 MHz). It is also necessary to increase the filter capacitor so that the signal at  the output of the squaring circuit is free of ripple. The corner frequency is set by the combination of the internal resistance  of 2 kΩ and the external filter capacitance. \nPower Consumption, Enable and Power-On \nThe quiescent current consumption of the AD8361 varies with \nthe size of the input signal from about 1 mA for no signal up to \n7 mA at an input level of 0.66 V rms (9.4 dBm, re 50 Ω). If the \ninput is driven beyond this point, the supply current increases \nsteeply (see Figure 16). There is little variation in quiescent \ncurrent with power supply voltage. The AD8361 can be disabled either by pulling the PWDN \n(Pin 4) to VPOS or by simply turning off the power to the \ndevice. While turning off the device obviously eliminates the current consumption, disabling the device reduces the leakage \ncurrent to less than 1 μA. Figure 27 and Figure 28 show the \nresponse of the output of the AD8361 to a pulse on the PWDN \npin, with no capacitance and with a filter capacitance of 0.01 μF, respectively; the turn-on time is a function of the filter capacitor. Figure 31 shows a plot of the output response to the \nsupply being turned on (i.e., PWDN is grounded and VPOS is \npulsed) with a filter capacitor of 0.01 μF. Again, the turn-on \ntime is strongly influenced by the size of the filter capacitor. \nIf the input of the AD8361 is driven while the device is disabled \n(PWDN = VPOS), the leakage current of less than 1 μA increases \nas a function of input level. When the device is disabled, the \noutput impedance increases to approximately 16 kΩ. \nVolts to dBm Conversion \nIn many of the plots, the horizont al axis is scaled in both rms \nvolts and dBm.

F | Page 16 of 22 Output Drive Capability and Buffering  \nThe AD8361 is capable of sourcing an output current of \napproximately 3 mA. If additional current is required, a simple \nbuffering circuit can be used as shown in Figure 51. Similar  \ncircuits can be used to increase or decrease the nominal conver sion \ngain of 7.5 V/V rms ( Figure 49 and Figure 50). In Figure 50, the \nAD8031 buffers a resistive divider to give a slope of 3.75 V/V rms. In Figure 49, the op amp’s gain of two increases the slope \nto 15 V/V rms. Using other resistor values, the slope can be changed to an arbitrary value. The AD8031 rail -to-rail op amp, \nused in t hese example, can swing  from 50  mV to 4.95 V on a \nsingle 5 V supply and operate at supply voltages down to 2.7 V . If high output current is required (>10  mA), the AD8051, which \nalso has rail -to- rail capability, can be used  down to a supply \nvoltage of 3 V . It can deliver up to 45 mA of output current.  \n \nFigure 49. Output Buffering Options, Slope of 15 V/V rms  \n \n \nFigure 50. Output Buffering Options, Slope of 3.75 V/V rms  \n \n \nFigure 51. Output Buffering Options, Slope of 7.5 V/V rms  OUTPUT REFERENCE TEM PERATURE DRIFT \nCOMPENSATION \nThe error due to low temperature drift of the AD8361 can be \nreduced if the temperature is known. Many systems incorporate a temperature sensor; the output of the sensor is typically digitized, facilitating a software correction. Using this informa tion, \nonly a two -point calibration at ambient is required.  \nThe output voltage of the AD8361 at ambient (25°C) can be \nexpressed by the equation  \n( )ΟΣς+×=IN OUT V GAIN V  \nwhere GAIN  is the conversion gain in V/V rms and V OS is the \nextrapolated output voltage for an input l evel of 0 V . GAIN  and \nVOS (also referred to as intercept and output reference) can be \ncalculated at ambient using a simple two -point calibration by \nmeasuring the output voltages for two specific input levels. Calibration at roughly 35 mV rms (− 16 dBm) and 250 mV rms \n(+1 dBm) is recommended for maximum linear dynamic range. However, alternative levels and ranges can be chosen to suit the \napplication. GAIN  and V\nOS are then calculated using the \nequations  \n( )\nIN1 IN2OUT1 OUT2\nV VV VGAIN−−=  \n( )IN1 OUT1 OS V GAIN V V ×−=  \nBoth GAIN  and VOS drift over temperature. However, the drift \nof VOS has a bigger influence on the error relative to the output. \nThis can be seen by inserting data from Figure 18 and Figure 21 \n(intercept drift and conversion gain) into the equation for V OUT. \nThese plots are consistent with Figure 14 and Figure 15, which \nshow that the error due to temperature drift decreases with \nincreasing input level. This results from the offset error having a diminishing influence with increasing level on the overall measurement error.  \nFrom Figure 18, the average intercept drift is 0.43 mV/°C from \n−40°C to +25°C and 0.17 mV/°C from +25°C to +85°C. For a less rigorous compensation scheme, the average drift over the complete temp erature range can be calculated as  \n()()\n()C/V 0.000304C40 C85V 0.028 V 0.010C/V ° =\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n°−−°+−−=°VOS DRIFT  \nWith the drift of VOS included, the equation for V OUT becomes  \nVOUT = (GAIN  × VIN) + VOS + DRIFT VOS × (TEMP  − 25°C)  100pF 0.01µF\n0.01µF\nAD8361VOUTVPOS\nCOMM PWDN\n5kΩ\n5kΩ5V\n15V/V rms AD8031\n01088-C-049\n100pF 0.01µF\n0.01µF\nAD8361VOUTVPOS\nCOMM PWDN5V\n3.75V/V rms AD8031 5kΩ5kΩ10kΩ\n01088-C-050\n100pF 0.01µF\n0.01µF\nAD8361VOUTVPOS\nCOMM PWDN5V\n7.5V/V rms AD8031\n01088-C-051\nData Sheet  AD8361  \n \nRev.

For a supply voltage o f  5  V,  t h e part exhibits a worst -case linearity error over \ntemperature of approximately ±0.3 dB over a dynamic range of 35 dB.  \n \nFigure 52.

Error after Temperature Compensation of  \nOutput Reference,800 MHz, V POS = 5 V  Extended Frequency Characterization  \nAlthough the AD8361 was originally intended as a power \nmeasurement and control device for cellular wireless applications, the AD8361 has useful performance at  higher \nfrequencies. Typical applications may include MMDS, LMDS, \nWLAN, and other noncellular activities.  \nIn orde r to characte rize the AD8361 at frequencies greater than \n2.5 GHz, a small collection of d evices were tested. Dynamic \nrange, conversion gain, and output intercept were measured at \nseveral frequencies over a temperature range of −30°C to +80°C. Both CW and 64 QAM modulated input wave forms were used in the characterization process in order to ac cess \nvarying peak -to-average waveform performance.  \nThe dynamic range of the device is calculated as the input power range over which the device remains within a permissible error margin to the ideal transfer function. Devices were tested over frequency and  temperature. After identifying \nan acceptable error margin for a given application, the usable dynamic measurement range can be identified using the plots in \nFigure 54 through Figure 57. For instance, for a 1 dB error \nmargin and a modulated carrier at 3 GHz, the usable dynamic \nrange can be found by insp ecting the 3 GHz plot of Figure 57. \nNote that the −30°C curve crosses the −1 dB error limit at \n−17 dBm . For a 5 V supply , the maximum input power should \nnot exceed 6 dBm in order to avoid compression. The resultant usable dynam ic range is therefore  \n6 dBm − (−17 dBm)  \nor 23 dBm over a temperature range of −30°C to +80°C.  \n \nFigure 54.

Con version Gain vs. Frequency for a  \nTypical Device, Supply 3 V, Ground Reference Mode  \nThe transfer functions and error for a CW input and a 64 QAM \ninput waveform is shown in Figure 58. The error curve is generated \nfrom  a linear reference based on the CW data. The increased \ncrest factor of the 64 QAM modulation results in a decrease in \noutput from the AD8361. This decrease in output is a result of \nthe limited bandwidth and compression of the interna l gain  stages. \nThis inaccuracy should be accounted for in systems where varying crest factor signals need to be measured.  The conversion  \ngain is defined as the s lope of the output voltage v s. the input \nrms voltage. An ideal best fit curve can be found for the measured  \ntransfer function at a given supply voltage and temperature. The slope of the ideal curve is identified as the conversion gain for a particular device. The conversion gain relates the measurement sensitivity of the AD8361 to the rms input voltage of the RF \nwaveform. The conversion gain was measured for a number of devices over a temperature range of −30°C to +80°C. The \nconversion gain for a typical device is shown in Figure 59. \nAlthough the conversion gain tends to decrease with increasing frequency, the AD8361 provide s measurement capability at \nfrequencies greater than 2.5  GHz. However, it is necessary to \ncalibrate for a given application to accommodate for the change in conversion gain at higher frequencies.  \n PIN (dBm)2.5\n–25ERROR (dB)2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n–0.5\n–1.0\n–1.5\n–2.0\n–2.5\n–20 –15 –10 –5 0 5 1010\n1\n0.1\nVOUT (V)+80°C\n+25°C\n–30°C\n01088-C-055\nPIN (dBm)2.5\n–25ERROR (dB)2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n–0.5\n–1.0\n–1.5\n–2.0\n–2.5\n–20 –15 –10 –5 0 5 1010\n1\n0.1\nVOUT (V)+80°C\n+25°C\n–30°C\n01088-C-056\nPIN (dBm)2.5\n–25ERROR (dB)2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n–0.5\n–1.0\n–1.5\n–2.0\n–2.5\n–20 –15 –10 –5 5 0 1010\n1\n0.1\nVOUT (V)+80°C\n+25°C\n–30°C\n01088-C-057PIN (dBm)2.5\n–25ERROR (dB)2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n–0.5\n–1.0\n–1.5\n–2.0\n–2.5\n–20 –15 –10 –5 5 0 1010\n1\n0.1\nVOUT (V)CW\n64 QAM\n01088-C-058\nFREQUENCY (MHz)8.0\n100CONVERSION GAIN (V/V rms)7.5\n7.0\n6.5\n6.0\n5.5\n5.0\n200 400 800 1200 1600 2200 2500 2700 3000\n01088-C-059\nData Sheet  AD8361  \n \nRev.

F | Page 21 of 22 Problems caused by impedance mismatch may arise using the \nevaluation board to examine the AD8361 performance. One way to reduce these problems is to put a coaxial 3 dB attenuator on the RFIN SMA connector. Mismatches at the source, cable, \nand cable interconnection, as well as those occurring on the \nevaluation board, can cause these problems. \nA simple (and common) example of such a problem is triple \ntravel due to mismatch at both the source and the evaluation board. Here the signal from the source reaches the evaluation board and mismatch causes a reflection. When that reflection reaches the source mismatch, it causes a new reflection, which \ntravels back to the evaluation board, adding to the original \nsignal incident at the board. The resultant voltage varies with both cable length and frequency dependence on the relative phase of the initial and reflected signals. Placing the 3 dB pad at the input of the board improves the match at the board and thus reduces the sensitivity to mismatches at the source. When such \nprecautions are taken, measurements are less sensitive to cable \nlength and other fixture issues. In an actual application when the distance between AD8361 and source is short and well \ndefined, this 3 dB attenuator is not needed. \nCHARACTERIZATION SETUPS \nEquipment \nThe primary characterization setup is shown in Figure 67. The \nsignal source used was a Rohde & Schwarz SMIQ03B, version \n3.90HX. The modulated waveforms used for IS95 reverse link, IS95 nine active channels forward (forward link 18 setting),  \nand W-CDMA 4-channel and 15-channel were generated using \nthe default settings coding and filtering. Signal levels were \ncalibrated into a 50 Ω impedance. Analysis \nThe conversion gain and output reference are derived using the \ncoefficients of a linear regression performed on data collected \nin its central operating range (35 mV rms to 250 mV rms). This \nrange was chosen to avoid areas of operation where offset distorts the linear response. Error is stated in two forms error from linear response to CW waveform and output delta from \n2°C performance. \nThe error from linear response to CW waveform is the \ndifference in output from the ideal output defined by the \nconversion gain and output reference. This is a measure of both \nthe linearity of the device response to both CW and modulated waveforms. The error in dB uses the conversion gain multiplied by the input as its reference. Error from linear response to CW waveform is not a measure of absolute accuracy, since it is \ncalculated using the gain and output reference of each device. \nHowever, it does show the linearity and effect of modulation on the device response. Error from 25°C performance uses the performance of a given device and waveform type as the reference; it is predominantly a measure of output variation with temperature. \n \nFigure 66.
