Users should check for and obtain the latest relevant information and verify that such information is current and \ncomplete before placing orders for Bourns® products.\nThe characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product set forth in its data sheet are based on laboratory conditions, and \nstatements regarding the suitability of products for certain types of applications are based on Bourns’  knowledge of typical \nrequirements in generic applications.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product in a user application may vary \nfrom the data sheet characteristics and parameters due to (i) the combination of the Bourns® product with other components \nin the user’s application, or (ii) the environment of the user application itself.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® \nproduct also can and do vary in different applications and actual performance may vary over time.  Users should always verify \nthe actual performance of the Bourns® product in their specific devices and applications, and make their own independent \njudgments regarding the amount of additional test margin to design into their device or application to compensate for  \ndifferences between laboratory and real world conditions.\nUnless Bourns has explicitly designated an individual Bourns® product as meeting the requirements of a particular industry \nstandard (e.g., ISO/TS 16949) or a particular qualification (e.g., UL  listed or recognized), Bourns is not responsible for any \nfailure of an individual Bourns® product to meet the requirements of such industry standard or particular qualification.

If Bourns \nexpressly identifies a sub-category of automotive application in the data sheet for its standard products (such as infotainment \nor lighting), such identification means that Bourns has reviewed its standard product and has determined that if such Bourns® \nstandard product is considered for potential use in automotive applications, it should only be used in such sub-category of \nautomotive applications.  Any reference to Bourns® standard product in the data sheet as compliant with the AEC-Q standard \nor “automotive grade” does not by itself mean that Bourns has approved such product for use in an automotive application.\nBourns® standard products are not tested to comply with United States Federal Aviation Administration standards generally \nor any other generally equivalent governmental organization standard applicable to products designed or manufactured for \nuse in aircraft or space applications.
