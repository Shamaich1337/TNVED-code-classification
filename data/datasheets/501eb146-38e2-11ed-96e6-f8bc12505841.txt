MIC49150\n \n  \nNovember 2006  9 M9999-111306 \n Application Information \nThe MIC49150 is an ultra-high performance, low-dropout \nlinear regulator designed for high current applications \nrequiring fast transient re sponse. The MI C49150 utilizes \ntwo input supplies, signi ﬁcantly reducing dropout \nvoltage, perfect for low-voltage, DC-to-DC conversion. \nThe MIC49150 requires a minimum of external comp-onents and obtains a bandwidth of up to 10MHz. As a \nµCap regulator, the output is tole rant of virtually any type \nof capacitor including cera mic type and tantalum type \ncapacitors. \nThe MIC49150 regulator is fully protected from damage \ndue to fault conditions, offeri ng linear current limiting and \nthermal shutdown. \nBias Supply Voltage \nV\nBIAS, requiring relatively light current, provides power to \nthe control portion of the MIC49150. V BIAS requires \napproximately 33mA for a 1.5A load current. Dropout conditions require higher currents. Most of the biasing \ncurrent is used to supply the base current to the pass \ntransistor. This allows the pass element to be driven into saturation, reducing the dropout to 300mV at a 1.5A load \ncurrent. Bypassing on the bias pin is recommended to \nimprove performance of t he regulator during line and \nload transients. Small ceramic capacitors from V\nBIAS to \nground help reduce high frequency noise from being \ninjected into the control circuitry from the bias rail and are good design practice. Good bypass techniques \ntypically include one larger capacitor such as 1µF \nceramic and smaller valued capacitors such as 0.01µF \nor 0.001µF in parallel with that larger capacitor to \ndecouple the bias supply. The V\nBIAS input voltage must \nbe 1.6V above the output vo ltage with a minimum V BIAS \ninput voltage of 3 volts. \nInput Supply Voltage \nVIN provides the high current to the collector of the pass \ntransistor. The minimum input voltage is 1.4V, allowing \ncon-version from low voltage supplies. \nOutput Capacitor \nThe MIC49150 requires a minimum of output capaci-\ntance to maintain stability. However, proper capacitor \nselection is important to ensure desired transient \nresponse. The MIC49150 is speci ﬁcally designed to be \nstable with virtually any c apacitance value and ESR. A \n1µF ceramic chip capacitor should satisfy most app-\nlications. Output capacitance can be increased without \nbound. See “ Typical Characteristic ” for examples of load \ntransient response. \nX7R dielectric ceramic capacitors are recommended \nbecause of their temperatur e performance. X7R-type \ncapacitors change capacitance by 15% over their \noperating temperature range and are the most stable type of ceramic capacitors. Z5U and Y5V dielectric \ncapacitors change value by as much as 50% and 60% \nrespectively over their operating temperature ranges. To \nuse a ceramic chip capacitor with Y5V dielectric, the value must be much higher than an X7R ceramic or a \ntantalum capacitor to ensure the same capacitance \nvalue over the operating temperature range. Tantalum capacitors have a very stable dielectric (10% over their \noperating temperature range) and can also be used with \nthis device. \nInput Capacitor \nAn input capacitor of 1µF or greater is recommended \nwhen the device is more than 4" away from the bulk supply capacitance, or w hen the supply is a battery. \nSmall, surface-mount, ceramic chip capacitors can be \nused for the bypassing. The capacitor should be placed within 1" of the device for optimal performance. Larger \nvalues will help to improve ripple rejection by bypassing \nthe input to the regulator, fu rther improving the integrity \nof the output voltage. \nThermal Design \nLinear regulators are simple to use. The most \ncomplicated design parameters to consider are thermal \ncharacteristics. Thermal design requires the following application-speci ﬁc parameters: \n• Maximum ambient temperature (T\nA) \n• Output current (I OUT) \n• Output voltage (V OUT) \n• Input voltage (V IN) \n• Ground current (I GND) \nFirst, calculate the power di ssipation of the regulator \nfrom these numbers and the device parameters from this datasheet. \n P\nD = V IN × I IN + V BIAS × I BIAS – V OUT × I OUT \nThe input current will be less  than the output  current at \nhigh output currents as the load increases. The bias \ncurrent is a sum of base drive and ground current. Ground current is constant over load current. Then the \nheat sink thermal resistance is determined with this \nformula: \n \n()CS JC\nDA J(MAX)\nSA θθPT T\nθ +−⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛−\n=  \nThe heat sink may be signi ﬁcantly reduced in \napplications where the maximum input voltage is known \nand large compared with the dropout voltage. Use a \nseries input resistor to drop excessive voltage and distribute the heat between this resistor and the \nregulator. The low-dropout properties of the MIC49150 \nallow signi ﬁcant reductions in regulator power dissipation \nand the associated heat sink without compromising \nperformance. When this technique is employed, a \nMicrel, Inc. MIC49150\n \n  \nNovember 2006  10 M9999-111306 \n capacitor of at least 1µF is needed directly between the \ninput and regulator ground. Refer to “ Application Note 9 ” \nfor further details and examples on thermal design and \nheat sink speci ﬁcation. \nMinimum Load Current \nThe MIC49150, unlike most  other high current \nregulators, does not require a minimum load to maintain output voltage regulation. \nPower MSOP-8 Thermal Characteristics \nOne of the secrets of the MI C49150’s performance is its \npower MSOP-8 package featuring half the thermal \nresistance of a standard  MSOP-8 package. Lower \nthermal resistance means more output current or higher input voltage for a given package size. \nLower thermal resistance is achieved by joining the four \nground leads with the die attach paddle to create a single-piece electrical and thermal conductor. This \nconcept has been used by MOSFET manufacturers for \nyears, proving very reliable and cost effective for the \nuser. \nThermal resistance consists of two main elements, θ\nJC \n(junction-to-case thermal resistance) and θCA (case-to-\nambient thermal resistance). See Figure 1. θJC is the \nresistance from the die to  the leads of the package. θCA \nis the resistance from the l eads to the ambient air and it \nincludes θCS (case-to-sink thermal resistance) and θSA \n(sink-to-ambient thermal resistance). \nUsing the power MSOP-8 reduces the θJC dramatically \nand allows the user to reduce θCA. The total thermal \nresistance, θJA (junction-to-ambient thermal resistance) \nis the limiting factor in ca lculating the maximum power \ndissipation capability of the device. Typically, the power \nMSOP-8 has a θJA of 80°C/W, this is signi ﬁcantly lower \nthan the standard MSOP-8 whic h is typically 160°C/W. \nθCA is reduced because pins 5 through 8 can now be \nsoldered directly to a ground plane which signi ﬁcantly \nreduces the case-to-sink ther mal resistance and sink to \nambient thermal resistance. \nLow-dropout linear regulators from Micrel are rated to a \nmaximum junction temperature of 125°C. It is important \nnot to exceed this maximum junction temperature during \noperation of the device. To  prevent this maximum \njunction temperature from being exceeded, the \nappropriate ground plane heat sink must be used. qJA\nqJC qCA\nprinted circuit boardground plane\nheat sink areaMSOP-8\nAMBIENT\n \nFigure 1.

Power dissipation in a linear regulator is \ncalculated as follows: \nP\nD = V IN × I IN + V BIAS × I BIAS – V OUT × I OUT \nUsing a typical application of 750mA output current, 1.2V \noutput voltage, 1.8V input vo ltage and 3.3V bias voltage, \nthe power dissipation is as follows: \nPD = (1.8V) × (730mA) + 3.3V(30mA) – 1.2V(750mA) \nAt full current, a small percent age of the output current is \nsupplied from the bias supply , therefore the input current \nis less than the output current. \nPD = 513mW \nFrom Figure 2, the minimum cu rrent of copper required \nto operate this application at a ∆T of 75°C is less than \n100mm2. \nQuick Method \nDetermine the power dissipation requirements for the design along with the maximum ambient temperature at which the device will be operated. Refer to Figure 3, \nwhich shows safe operating curves for three different \nambient temperatures: 25°C, 50°C and 85°C. From these curves, the minimum amount of copper can be \ndetermined by knowing the maxi-mum power dissipation \nrequired. If the maximum ambient temperature is 50°C and the power dissipation is as above, 513mW, the \ncurve in Figure 3 shows that the required area of copper \nis less than 100mm\n2. The θJA of this package is ideally  80°C/W, but it will vary \ndepending upon the availabilit y of copper ground plane \nto which it is attached. \nAdjustable Regulator Design \nThe MIC49150 adjustable version allows programming the output voltage anywhere between 0.9Vand 5V. Two \nresistors are used. The resistor value between V\nOUT and \nthe adjust pin should not exceed 10k Ω. Larger values \ncan cause instability.  The resistor values are calculated \nby: \n ⎟⎟\n⎠⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝⎛−×= 10.9VR2 R1OUT \nWhere V OUT is the desired output voltage. \nEnable \nThe ﬁxed output voltage versions of the MIC49150 \nfeature an active high enable input (EN) that allows on-\noff control of the regulator. Current drain reduces to “zero” when the device is shutdown, with only \nmicroamperes of leakage current. The EN input has \nTTL/CMOS compatible thresh olds for simple logic \ninterfacing. EN may be directly tied to V\nIN and pulled up \nto the maximum supply voltage. \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nMicrel, Inc.
