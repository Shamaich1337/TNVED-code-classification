It can deliver up to 3A DC output current with few external input and output capacitors. This module provides precisely regulated output voltage adjustable between 0.6V to 5.5V via one external resistor over a 4V to 20V input voltage range. With an external bias supply above 4V connected to SV\nIN, this module operates with \nan input voltage down to 2.375V. The typical application schematic is shown in Figure 24.\nThe LTM4623 contains an integrated constant on-time \nvalley current mode regulator , power MOSFETs, inductor , and other supporting discrete components. The default switching frequency is 1MHz. For output voltages between 3.3V and 5.5V, an external 162k resistor is required between FREQ and SGND pins to set the operating frequency to 2MHz to optimize inductor current ripple. For switching noise-sensitive applications, the switching frequency can be adjusted by external resistors and the /uni03BCModule regulator can be externally synchronized to a clock within ±30% of \nthe set frequency. See the Applications Information section.\nWith current mode control and internal feedback loop \ncompensation, the LTM4623 module has sufficient stabil -\nity margins and good transient performance with a wide range of output capacitors, even with all ceramic output capacitors.\nCurrent mode control provides cycle-by-cycle fast cur -\nrent limiting. Foldback current limiting is provided in an \novercurrent condition indicated by a drop in V\nFB reducing \ninductor valley current to approximately 40% of the origi -\nnal value. Internal output overvoltage and undervoltage comparators pull the open-drain PGOOD output low if the output feedback voltage exits a ±10% window around the regulation point. Continuous operation is forced during OV and UV condition except during start-up when the TRACK pin is ramping up to 0.6V. \nFurthermore, in order to protect the internal power MOSFET \ndevices against transient voltage spikes, the LTM4623 constantly monitors the V\nIN pin for an overvoltage condi -\ntion. When V IN rises above 23.5V, the regulator suspends \noperation by shutting off both power MOSFETs. Once V IN\ndrops below 21.5V, the regulator immediately resumes normal operation. The regulator does not execute its soft-start function when exiting an overvoltage condition.\nMultiphase operation can be easily employed with the \nsynchronization and phase mode controls. Up to 12 phases can be cascaded to run simultaneously with respect to each other by programming the PHMODE pin to different levels. The LTM4623 has CLKIN and CLKOUT pins for PolyPhase operation of multiple devices or frequency synchronization. \nPulling the RUN pin below 1.1V forces the controller into \nits shutdown state, turning off both power MOSFETs and most of the internal control circuitry. At light load currents, discontinuous mode (DCM) operation can be enabled to achieve higher efficiency compared to continu -\nous mode (CCM) by pulling the MODE pin to SGND. The TRACK/SS pin is used for power supply tracking and soft-start programming. See the Applications Informa-tion section.\nLTM4623\n10Rev D\nFor more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe typical LTM4623 application circuit is shown in \nFigure/uni00A0 24. External component selection is primarily determined by the input voltage, the output voltage and the maximum load current. Refer to Table/uni00A07 for specific external capacitor requirements for a particular application.\nV\nIN to V OUT Step-Down Ratios\nThere are restrictions in the maximum V IN and V OUT step-\ndown ratios that can be achieved for a given input voltage \ndue to the minimum off-time and minimum on-time limits of the regulator . The minimum off-time limit imposes a maximum duty cycle which can be calculated as: \n  D\nMAX = 1 – (t OFF(MIN)  • fSW)\nwhere t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum off-time, typically 70ns \nfor LTM4623, and f SW (Hz) is the switching frequency. \nConversely the minimum on-time limit imposes a minimum \nduty cycle of the converter which can be calculated as:\n D MIN = tON(MIN)  • fSW\nwhere t ON(MIN)  is the minimum on-time, typically 40ns \nfor LTM4623. In the rare cases where the minimum duty \ncycle is surpassed, the output voltage will still remain in regulation, but the switching frequency will decrease from its programmed value. Note that additional thermal derating may be applied. See the Thermal Considerations and Output Current Derating section in this data sheet.\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe PWM controller has an internal 0.6V reference voltage. \nAs shown in the Block Diagram, a 60.4k internal feedback \nresistor connects the V\nOUT and FB pins together . Adding a \nresistor , R FB, from FB pin to SGND programs the output \nvoltage:\n RFB=0.6V\nVOUT−0.6V• 60.4k\nTable/uni00A01.

See Operating Frequency section.For parallel operation of N-channels LTM4623, tie all the \nFB pins together and use the following equation to solve for R\nFB:\n RFB=0.6V\nVOUT– 0.6V•60.4k\nN\nInput Decoupling Capacitors\nThe LTM4623 module should be connected to a low AC \nimpedance DC source. For the regulator , a 10µF input ceramic capacitor is required for RMS ripple current de -\ncoupling. Bulk input capacitance is only needed when the input source impedance is compromised by long inductive leads, traces or not enough source capacitance. The bulk capacitor can be an aluminum electrolytic capacitor or polymer capacitor .\nWithout considering the inductor ripple current, the RMS \ncurrent of the input capacitor can be estimated as:\nICIN(RMS) =IOUT(MAX)\nη%• D • (1 −D)\nwhere η% is the estimated efficiency of the power module.\nOutput Decoupling Capacitors\nWith an optimized high frequency, high bandwidth design, \nonly a single low ESR output ceramic capacitor is required for the LTM4623 to achieve low output ripple voltage and very good transient response. Additional output filtering may be required by the system designer if further reduction of output ripple or dynamic transient spikes is required. Table/uni00A07 shows a matrix of different output voltages and output capacitors to minimize the voltage droop and overshoot during a 1A load-step transient. The Linear Technology L TpowerCAD™ design tool is available to download online for output ripple, stability and transient response analysis for further optimization.\nDiscontinuous Current Mode (DCM)\nIn applications where low output ripple and high efficiency \nat intermediate current are desired, discontinuous current mode (DCM) should be used by connecting the MODE pin \nLTM4623\n11Rev D\nFor more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nto SGND. At light loads the internal current comparator \nmay remain tripped for several cycles and force the top MOSFET to stay off for several cycles, thus skipping cycles. The inductor current does not reverse in this mode. \nForced Continuous Current Mode (CCM)\nIn applications where fixed frequency operation is more \ncritical than low current efficiency, and where the lowest output ripple is desired, forced continuous operation should be used. Forced continuous operation can be enabled by tying the MODE pin to INTV\nCC. In this mode, inductor current \nis allowed to reverse during low output loads, the COMP voltage is in control of the current comparator threshold throughout, and the top MOSFET always turns on with each oscillator pulse. During start-up, forced continuous mode is disabled and inductor current is prevented from revers -\ning until the LTM4623’s output voltage is in regulation. \nOperating Frequency\nThe operating frequency of the LTM4623 is optimized to \nachieve the compact package size and the minimum out-put ripple voltage while still keeping high efficiency. The default operating frequency is internally set to 1MHz. In most applications, no additional frequency adjusting is required.\nIf any operating frequency other than 1MHz is required \nby application, the operating frequency can be increased by adding a resistor , RFSET , between the FREQ pin and SGND, as shown in Figure 28. The operating frequency can be calculated as:\nf(Hz) =1.6e11\n162k || RFSET(Ω)\nTo reduce switching current ripple, 2MHz operating fre-\nquency is required for 3.3V to 5.5V output with R FSET/uni00A0 =/uni00A0162k \nto SGND. \nThe operating frequency can also be decreased by adding \na resistor between the FREQ pin and INTV CC, calculated as:\n f(Hz) =1 MHz −2.8e11\nRFSET(Ω)The programmable operating frequency range is from 800kHz to 4MHz.\nPlease note a minimum switching frequency is required \nfor given V\nIN, VOUT operating conditions to keep a maxi -\nmum peak-to-peak inductor ripple current below 2A for the LTM4623.  \nThe peak-to-peak inductor ripple current can be calculated \nas:\n ΔIP-P=VOUT 1−VOUT\nVIN⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•1\nfSW(MHz)\nThe maximum 2A peak-to-peak inductor ripple current \nis enforced due to the nature of the valley current mode control to maintain output voltage regulation at no load.\nFrequency Synchronization and Clock In\nThe power module has a phase-locked loop comprised \nof an internal voltage controlled oscillator and a phase detector . This allows the internal top MOSFET turn-on to be locked to the rising edge of the external clock. The external clock frequency range must be within ±30% around the set operating frequency. A pulse detection circuit is used to detect a clock on the CLKIN pin to turn on the phase-locked loop. The pulse width of the clock has to be at least 100ns. The clock high level must be above 2V and clock low level below 0.3V. During the start-up of the regulator , the phase-locked loop function is disabled.\nMultiphase Operation\nFor output loads that demand more than 3A of current, \nmultiple LTM4623s can be paralleled to run out of phase \nto provide more output current without increasing input and output voltage ripples.\nThe CLKOUT signal can be connected to the CLKIN pin of \nthe following LTM4623 stage to line up both the frequency and the phase of the entire system. Tying the PHMODE pin to INTVCC, SGND or INTV\nCC/2 generates a phase differ -\nence (between CLKIN and CLKOUT) of 180°, 120°, or 90° respectively, which corresponds to 2-phase, 3-phase or 4-phase operation. A total of 12 phases can be cascaded \nLTM4623\n12Rev D\nFor more information www.analog.comto run simultaneously out-of-phase with respect to each \nother by programming the PHMODE pin of each LTM4623 to different levels.

PHMODE Pin Status and Corresponding Phase \nRelationship (Relate to CLKIN)\nPHASMD INTV CC SGND INTV CC/2\nCLKOUT 180° 120° 90°A multiphase power supply significantly reduces the \namount of ripple current in both the input and output ca -\npacitors. The RMS input ripple current is reduced by, and the effective ripple frequency is multiplied by, the number of phases used (assuming that the input voltage is greater than the number of phases used times the output voltage). The output ripple amplitude is also reduced by the number of phases used when all of the outputs are tied together  to achieve a single high output current design.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 2. 4-Phase, 6-Phase Operation \nFigure 3.

This will balance the thermals on the design. Please tie the RUN, TRACK/SS, FB and COMP pins of each paralleling module together .

The input RMS ripple current can -\ncellation mathematical derivations are presented, and a graph is displayed representing the RMS ripple current reduction as a function of the number of interleaved phases. Figure/uni00A03 shows this graph.\nSoft-Start And Output Voltage T racking\nThe TRACK/SS pin provides a means to either soft start \nthe regulator or track it to a different power supply. A capacitor on the TRACK/SS pin will program the ramp rate of the output voltage. An internal 2µA current source will charge up the external soft-start capacitor towards INTV\nCC voltage. When the TRACK/SS voltage is below \n0.6V, it will take over the internal 0.6V reference voltage to control the output voltage. The total soft-start time can be calculated as:\n \ntSS=0.6 •CSS\n2µA\nwhere C SS is the capacitance on the TRACK/SS pin. Cur-\nrent foldback and forced continuous mode are disabled \nduring the soft-start process.\nOutput voltage tracking can also be programmed externally \nusing the TRACK/SS pin. The output can be tracked up and down with another regulator . Figure 4 and Figure 5 show an example waveform and schematic of ratiometric tracking where the slave regulator’s output slew rate is proportional to the master’s.\nFigure 4.

From the equation, we could solve \nthat R TR(TOP) = 60.4k and R TR(BOT)  = 40.2k are a good \ncombination for the ratiometric tracking.\nFigure 6. Output Coincident T racking WaveformThe TRACK/SS pin will have the 2µA current source on when a resistive divider is used to implement tracking on the slave regulator . This will impose an offset on the \nTRACK/SS pin input. Smaller value resistors with the same \nratios as the resistor values calculated from the above equation can be used. For example, where the 60.4k is \nused then a 6.04k can be used to reduce the TRACK/SS pin offset to a negligible value.\nThe coincident output tracking can be recognized as a \nspecial ratiometric output tracking in which the master’s output slew rate (MR) is the same as the slave’s output slew rate (SR), waveform as shown in Figure 6.\nFrom the equation, we could easily find that, in coincident \ntracking, the slave regulator’ s TRACK/SS pin resistor divider \nis always the same as its feedback divider:\nRFB(SL)\nRFB(SL) +60.4k=RTR(BOT)\nRTR(TOP) +RTR(BOT)\nFor example, R TR(TOP)  = 60.4k and R TR(BOT)  = 60.4k is a \ngood combination for coincident tracking for a V OUT(MA) \n= 1.5V and V OUT(SL)  = 1.2V application.\nPower Good\nThe PGOOD pin is an open-drain pin that can be used to \nmonitor valid output voltage regulation. This pin is pulled low when the output voltage exceeds a ±10% window around the regulation point. To prevent unwanted PGOOD glitches during transients or dynamic V\nOUT changes, the \nLTM4623’s PGOOD falling edge includes a blanking delay of approximately 52 switching cycles.\nStability Compensation\nThe LTM4623’ s internal compensation loop is designed and \noptimized for use with low ESR ceramic output capacitors. \nTable/uni00A07 is provided for most application requirements. In case more phase margin is required for the application, an additional 100pF feedforward capacitor (C\nFF) can be \nplaced between the V OUT and FB pins. The L TpowerCAD \ndesign tool is available for control loop optimization.\nTIMEMASTER OUTPUT\nSLAVE OUTPUTOUTPUT VOL TAGE\n4623 F06\nLTM4623\n15Rev D\nFor more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nRUN Enable\nPulling the RUN pin to ground forces the LTM4623 into \nits shutdown state, turning off both power MOSFETs and most of its internal control circuitry. Bringing the RUN pin above 0.7V turns on the internal reference only, while still keeping the power MOSFETs off. Increasing the RUN pin voltage above 1.2V will turn on the entire chip.\nLow Input Application\nThe LTM4623 module has a separate SV IN pin which makes \nit suitable for low input voltage applications down to 2.375V. \nThe SV IN pin is the single input of the whole control circuitry \nwhile the V IN pin is the power input which directly connects \nto the drain of the top MOSFET . In most applications where V\nIN is greater than 4V, connect SV IN directly to V IN with a \nshort trace. An optional filter , consisting of a resistor (1/uni03A9  \nto 10/uni03A9) between SV IN and V IN along with a 0.1µF bypass \ncapacitor between SV IN and ground, can be placed for \nadditional noise immunity. This filter is not necessary in most cases if good PCB layout practices are followed (see Figure 23). In a low input voltage application (2.375V to 4V), connect SV\nIN to an external voltage higher than 4V  \nwith 1µF local bypass capacitor . See Operating Frequency section. Figure 25 shows an example of a low input voltage application. Please note the SV\nIN voltage cannot go below \nthe V OUT voltage.\nPre-Biased Output Start-Up\nThere may be situations that require the power supply to start up with a pre-bias on the output capacitors. In this case, it is desirable to start up without discharging that output pre-bias. The LTM4623 can safely power up into a pre-biased output without discharging it.\nThe LTM4623  accomplishes this by forcing discontinuous \nmode (DCM) operation until the TRACK/SS pin voltage \nreaches 0.6V reference voltage. This will prevent the BG from turning on during the pre-biased output start-up which would discharge the output.\nPlease do not pre-bias LTM4623 with a voltage higher \nthan INTV\nCC (3.3V) voltage or a voltage higher than the \noutput voltage set by the feedback resistor (R FB).Overtemperature Protection\nThe internal overtemperature protection monitors the junction temperature of the module. If the junction temperature reaches approximately 160°C, both power switches will be turned off until the temperature drops about 15°C cooler .\nRadiated EMI Noise\nHigh radiated EMI noise is a disadvantage for switching \nregulators by nature. Fast switching turn-on and turn-off make the large di/dt change in the converters, which act as the radiation sources in most systems. LTM4623 in -\ntegrates the feature to minimize the radiated EMI noise to meet the most applications with low noise requirements. It is fully compliant with the EN55022 Class B Standard.\nThermal Considerations and Output Current Derating\nThe thermal resistances reported in the Pin Configuration \nsection of the data sheet are consistent with those param -\neters defined by JESD 51-12 and are intended for use with finite element analysis (FEA) software modeling tools that leverage the outcome of thermal modeling, simulation, and correlation to hardware evaluation performed on a µModule package mounted to a hardware test board. The motivation for providing these thermal coefficients is found in JESD 51-12 (Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information).\nMany designers may opt to use laboratory equipment \nand a test vehicle such as the demo board to anticipate the µModule regulator’s thermal performance in their ap -\nplication at various electrical and environmental operating conditions to compliment any FEA activities. Without FEA software, the thermal resistances reported in the Pin Con -\nfiguration section are, in and of themselves, not relevant to providing guidance of thermal performance; instead, the derating curves provided in this data sheet can be used in a manner that yields insight and guidance pertaining to one’s application usage, and can be adapted to correlate thermal performance to one’s own application.\nLTM4623\n16Rev D\nFor more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe Pin Configuration section gives four thermal coeffi -\ncients explicitly defined in JESD 51-12; these coefficients \nare quoted or paraphrased next:\n1. θJA, the thermal resistance from junction to ambient, is \nthe natural convection junction-to-ambient air thermal \nresistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed enclo -\nsure. This environment is sometimes referred to as “still air” although natural convection causes the air to move. This value is determined with the part mounted to a 95mm × 76mm PCB with four layers.\n2. θ\nJCbottom , the thermal resistance from junction to the \nbottom of the product case, is determined with all of the component power dissipation flowing through the bottom of the package. In the typical µModule regulator , the bulk of the heat flows out the bottom of the pack -\nage, but there is always heat flow out into the ambient environment. As a result, this thermal resistance value may be useful for comparing packages, but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n3. θ\nJCtop, the thermal resistance from junction to top of \nthe product case, is determined with nearly all of the component power dissipation flowing through the top of the package. As the electrical connections of the typical µModule regulator are on the bottom of the package, it is rare for an application to operate such that most of the heat flows from the junction to the top of the part. As in the case of θ\nJCbottom , this value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.4. θ\nJB, the thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board, is the junction-to-board thermal resistance where almost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the µModule package and into the board, and is really the sum of the θ\nJCbottom  and the thermal resistance of \nthe bottom of the part through the solder joints and through a portion of the board. The board temperature is measured a specified distance from the package.\nA graphical representation of the aforementioned ther -\nmal resistances is given in Figure 7; blue resistances are contained within the /uni03BCModule regulator , whereas green resistances are external to the µModule package.\nAs a practical matter , it should be clear to the reader that \nno individual or sub-group of the four thermal resistance parameters defined by JESD 51-12 or provided in the Pin Configuration section replicates or conveys normal operating conditions of a /uni03BCModule regulator . For example, in normal board-mounted applications, never does 100% of the device’s total power loss (heat) thermally conduct exclusively through the top or exclusively through bot -\ntom of the µModule package—as the standard defines for θ\nJCtop and θ JCbottom , respectively. In practice, power \nloss is thermally dissipated in both directions away from the package—granted, in the absence of a heat sink and airflow, a majority of the heat flow is into the board.\nWithin the LTM4623 be aware there are multiple power \ndevices and components dissipating power , with a con -\nsequence that the thermal resistances relative to different junctions of components or die are not exactly linear with \nFigure 7.

To reconcile this \ncomplication without sacrificing modeling simplicity— but \nalso, not ignoring practical realities— an approach has been \ntaken using FEA software modeling along with laboratory testing in a controlled environment chamber to reason -\nably define and correlate the thermal resistance values supplied in this data sheet: (1) Initially, FEA software is used to accurately build the mechanical geometry of the LTM4623 and the specified PCB with all of the correct material coefficients along with accurate power loss source definitions; (2) this model simulates a software-defined JEDEC environment consistent with JESD 51-12 to predict power loss heat flow and temperature readings at different interfaces that enable the calculation of the JEDEC-defined thermal resistance values; (3) the model and FEA software is used to evaluate the LTM4623 with heat sink and airflow; (4) having solved for and analyzed these thermal resistance values and simulated various operating conditions in the software model, a thorough laboratory evaluation replicates the simulated conditions with thermocouples within a controlled environment chamber while operating the device at the same power loss as that which was simulated. An outcome of this process and due diligence yields the set of derating curves shown in this data sheet. After these laboratory tests have been performed and correlated to the LTM4623 model, then the θ\nJB and θ BA are summed \ntogether to provide a value that should closely equal the θ\nJA value because approximately 100% of power loss \nflows from the junction through the board into ambient with no airflow or top mounted heat sink.\nThe 1.0V, 1.5V, 3.3V and 5V loss curves in Figures 8 to 11 \ncan be used in coordination with the load current derating curves in Figures 12 to 22 for calculating an approximate θ\nJA thermal resistance for the LTM4623 with various air -\nflow conditions. The power loss curves are taken at room temperature, and are increased with a multiplicative factor according to the ambient temperature. This approximate factor is: 1.3 for 120°C at junction temperature. Maximum load current is achievable while increasing ambient tem -\nperature as long as the junction temperature is less than 120°C, which is a 5°C guard band from maximum junction temperature of 125°C. When the ambient temperature reaches a point where the junction temperature is 120°C, then the load current is lowered to maintain the junction at 120°C while increasing ambient temperature up to 120°C. The derating curves are plotted with the output current starting at 3A and the ambient temperature at 30°C. The output voltages are 1.0V, 1.5V, 3.3V and 5V. These are chosen to include the lower and higher output voltage ranges for correlating the thermal resistance. Thermal models are derived from several temperature measure -\nments in a controlled temperature chamber along with thermal modeling analysis. The junction temperatures are monitored while ambient temperature is increased with and without airflow. The power loss increase with ambient temperature change is factored into the derating curves. The junctions are maintained at 120°C maximum while lowering output current or power with increasing ambient temperature. The decreased output current will decrease the internal module loss as ambient temperature is increased. The monitored junction temperature of 120°C minus the ambient operating temperature specifies how much module temperature rise can be allowed. As an example, in Figure 16 the load current is derated to 2.5A at ~95°C with no air flow or heat sink and the power loss for the 12V to 1.5V at 2.5A output is about 1.0W. The 1.0W loss is calculated with the ~0.8W room temperature loss from the 12V to 1.5V power loss curve at 2.5A in Figure 9, and the 1.3 multiplying factor at 120°C junction temperature. If the \n95°C ambient temperature is subtracted from the 120°C junction temperature, then the difference of 25°C divided by 1.0W equals a 25°C/W θ\nJA thermal resistance. Table/uni00A04  \nspecifies a 25°C/W value which is very close. Table/uni00A03 to Table/uni00A06 provide equivalent thermal resistances for 1.0V to 5V outputs with and without airflow. The derived thermal resistances in Table/uni00A03 to Table/uni00A06 for the various condi -\ntions can be multiplied by the calculated power loss as a function of ambient temperature to derive temperature rise above ambient, thus maximum junction temperature. Room temperature power loss can be derived from the ef -\nficiency curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section and adjusted with the above ambient temperature multiplicative factors.

There is no internal fuse. If required, \na slow blow fuse with a rating twice the maximum input current needs to be provided to protect each unit from catastrophic failure. The device does support thermal shutdown and overcurrent protection. \nLayout Checklist/Example\nThe high integration of LTM4623 makes the PCB board \nlayout very simple and easy. However , to optimize its electri -\ncal and thermal performance, some layout considerations are still necessary.• Use large PCB copper areas for high current paths, including V\nIN, GND and V OUT. It helps to minimize the \nPCB conduction loss and thermal stress.\n• Place high frequency ceramic input and output capaci -\ntors next to the V IN, PGND and V OUT pins to minimize \nhigh frequency noise.\n• Place a dedicated power ground layer underneath the unit.\n• To minimize the via conduction loss and reduce module thermal stress, use multiple vias for interconnection between top layer and other power layers.\n• Do not put via directly on the pad, unless they are capped or plated over .Table/uni00A05. 3.3V Output, No Heat Sink\nDERATING CURVE VIN (V) POWER LOSS CURVE AIR FLOW (LFM) HEAT SINK θJA(°C/W)\nFigures 18, 19, 20 5, 12, 16 Figure 10 0 None 25\nFigures 18, 19, 20 5, 12, 16 Figure 10 200 None 22\nFigures 18, 19, 20 5, 12, 16 Figure 10 400 None 22\nTable/uni00A06. 5V Output, No Heat Sink\nDERATING CURVE VIN (V) POWER LOSS CURVE AIR FLOW (LFM) HEAT SINK θJA(°C/W)\nFigures 21, 22 12, 16 Figure 11 0 None 25\nFigures 21, 22 12, 16 Figure 11 200 None 22\nFigures 21, 22 12, 16 Figure 11 400 None 22\nLTM4623\n21Rev D\nFor more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 23.
