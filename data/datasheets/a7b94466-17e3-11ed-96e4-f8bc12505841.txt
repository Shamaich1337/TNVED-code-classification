That is especially the case when separate power supplies  \nare used for bench tests. When using compact wiring and  \nregulated supplies as e. g. in phone applications in most  \ncases no external components are necessary. \nFig. 1 - Recommended Test Circuit\nNote\n(1)R1 is optional when reduced intensity is used  \nThe capacitor C1 is buffering the supply voltage and  \neliminates the inductance of the power supply line. This one  \nshould be a Tantalum or othe r fast capacitor to guarantee  \nthe fast rise time of the IRED current. The resistor R1 is the  \ncurrent limiting resistor, whic h may be used to reduce the  \noperating current to levels below the specified controlled  \nvalues for saving battery power.Vishay's transceivers integrate a sensitive receiver and a  \nbuilt-in power driver. The co mbination of both needs a  \ncareful circuit board layout. Th e use of thin, long, resistive  \nand inductive wiring should be  avoided. The shutdown input  \nmust be grounded for normal operation, also when the  \nshutdown function is not used.  The inputs (TXD, SD) and the output RXD should be directly  \nconnected (DC-coupled) to the I/O circuit. The capacitor C2  \nc o m b i n e d  w i t h  t h e  r e s i s t o r  R 2  i s  t h e  l o w  p a s s  f i l t e r  f o r  \nsmoothing the supply voltage. R2, C1 and C2 are optional  and dependent on the quality of the supply voltages V\nCC1\nand injected noise. An unstab le power supply with dropping  \nvoltage during transmission ma y reduce the sensitivity (and  \ntransmission range) of the transceiver.\nThe placement of these parts is critical. It is strongly  \nrecommended to position C2 as close as possible to the  \ntransceiver power supply pins.When extended wiring is used (bench tests!) the inductance  \nof the power supply can cause dynamically a voltage drop  \nat V\nCC2. Often some power supplie s are not able to follow  \nthe fast current rise time. In that case another 4.7 μF (type,  \nsee table under C1) at V CC2 will be helpful.\nUnder extreme EMI conditions as placing an  \nRF-transmitter antenna on top of the transceiver, we  \nrecommend to protect all inputs by a low-pass filter, as a  \nminimum a 12 pF capacitor, espe cially at the RXD port. The  \ntransceiver itself wi thstands EMI at GSM frequencies above  \n500 V/m. When interference is  observed, the wiring to the  \ninputs picks it up. It is verified by DPI measurements that as  \nlong as the interfering RF - voltage is below the logic  \nthreshold levels of the inputs and equivalent levels at the  \noutputs no interferences are expected.One should keep in mind th at basic RF-design rules for  \ncircuit design should be taken into account. Especially  \nlonger signal lines should not be used without termination.  \nSee e.g. “The Art of Electronic s” Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill,  \n1989, Cambridge University Press, ISBN: 0521370957.  \n     \nFigure 2 shows an example of a typical application with a  \nseparate supply voltage V\nS and using the transceiver with  \nthe IRED anode connected to the unregulated battery V batt. \nThis method reduces the peak load of the regulated power  \nsupply and saves therefore cost s. Alternatively all supplies  \ncan also be tied to only one voltage source. R1 and C1 are  \nnot used in this case and are depending on the circuit  \ndesign in most cases not necessary.  In Fig. 2 an option is shown to operate the transmitter at two  \ndifferent power levels to switch  for long range to low power  \nmode for e.g. saving power fo r IrDA application but use the  \nfull range specification for remote control. The additional  components are marked in the figure.For operating at RS232 ports we recommend to use an  \nencoder / decoder-module.VCC2, IRED A\nVCC1 \nGround  \nSDTXDRXDIRED  CV\nIRED \nVCC\nGND \nSDTXD\n \nRXD R1(1)\nR2 \nC1 C2 \n20037\nTABLE 1 - RECOMMENDED TESTS AND APPLICATION CIRCUIT COMPONENTS\nCOMPONENT RECOMMENDED VA LUE VISHAY PART NUMBER\nC1 4.7 μF, 16 V 293D 475X9 016BC2 0.1 μF, ceramic VJ 1206 Y 104 J XXMT\nR1 Depends on current to be adjusted, e. g. with V\nCC2 = 3.3 V 56 Ω is an option for minimum low power operation\nR2 47 Ω, 0.125 W CRCW-1206-47R0-F-RT1\nTFDU4101\nwww.vishay.comVishay Semiconductors  \n \nRev. 2.1, 11-Oct-2021 7 Document Number: 81288\nFor technical questions, contact: irdasupportAM@vishay.com\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
