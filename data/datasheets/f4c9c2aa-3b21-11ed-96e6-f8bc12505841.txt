The DS1631 and DS1631A \nthermometer accuracy is ±0.5°C from 0°C to +70°C with \n3.0V ≤ V DD ≤ 5.5V, and the DS1731 accuracy is ±1°C \nfrom -10°C to +85°C with 3.0V ≤ V DD ≤ 5.5V. The ther -\nmostat on all three devices provides custom hysteresis \nwith user-defined trip points (T H and T L). The T H and \nTL registers and thermometer configuration settings are \nstored in NV EEPROM so they can be programmed prior \nto installation. In addition, the DS1631A automatically \nbegins taking temperature measurements at power-up, \nwhich allows it to function as a stand-alone thermostat.\nPin descriptions for the DS1631/DS1631A/DS1731 are pro -\nvided in Table 2  and user-accessible registers are summa -\nrized in Table 3 .

A delta-\nsigma analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts the \nmeasured temperature to a 9-, 10-, 11-, or 12-bit (user-\nselectable) digital value that is calibrated in °C; for °F \napplications a lookup table or conversion routine must be \nused. Throughout this data sheet, the term “conversion” is \nused to refer to the entire temperature measurement and \nADC sequence. \nThe DS1631 and DS1731 always power-up in a low-pow -\ner idle state, and the Start Convert T command must be \nused to initiate conversions. The DS1631A begins conver -\nsions automatically at power-up in the mode determined \nby the configuration register’s 1SHOT bit.\nThe DS1631, DS1631A, and DS1731 can be programmed \nto perform continuous consecutive conversions (continu -\nous-conversion mode) or to perform single conversions \non command (one-shot mode). The conversion mode is \nprogrammed through the 1SHOT bit in the configuration \nregister as explained in the Configuration Register  sec-\ntion of this data sheet. In continuous-conversion mode, \nthe DS1631A begins performing continuous conversions \nimmediately at power-up, and the DS1631 and DS1731 \nbegin continuous conversions after a Start Convert T \ncommand is issued. For all three devices, consecu -\ntive conversions continue to be performed until a Stop \nConvert T command is issued, at which time the device \ngoes into a low-power idle state. Continuous conversions \ncan be restarted at any time using the Start Convert T \ncommand.\nIn one-shot mode the DS1631A performs a single con -\nversion at power-up, and the DS1631 and DS1731 \nperform a single temperature conversion when a Start \nConvert T command is issued. For all three devices, \nwhen the conversion is complete the device enters a \nlow-power idle state and remains in that state until a \nsingle temperature conversion is again initiated by a Start \nConvert T command. The resolution of the output digital temperature data is \nuser-configurable to 9, 10, 11, or 12 bits, corresponding \nto temperature increments of 0.5°C, 0.25°C, 0.125°C, and \n0.0625°C, respectively. The default resolution at power-\nup is 12 bits, and it can be changed through the R0 and \nR1 bits in the configuration register. Note that the conver -\nsion time doubles for each additional bit of resolution.\nAfter each conversion, the digital temperature is stored \nas a 16-bit two’s complement number in the two-byte \ntemperature register as shown in Figure 4 . The sign bit \n(S) indicates if the temperature is positive or negative: \nfor positive numbers S = 0 and for negative numbers \nS = 1. The Read Temperature command provides user \naccess to the temperature register. Bits 3 through 0 of \nthe temperature register are hardwired to 0. When the \ndevice is configured for 12-bit resolution, the 12 MSbs \n(bits 15 through 4) of the temperature register contain \ntemperature data. For 11 bit resolution, the 11 MSbs (bits \n15 through 5) of the temperature register contain data, \nand bit 4 is 0. Likewise, for 10-bit resolution, the 10 MSbs \n(bits 15 through 6) contain data, and for 9-bit the 9 MSbs \n(bits 15 through 7) contain data, and all unused LSbs con -\ntain 0s. Table 4  gives examples of 12-bit resolution output \ndata and the corresponding temperatures.\nTable 4. 12-Bit Resolution Temperature/\nData Relationship\nTEMPERATURE \n(°C)DIGITAL OUTPUT \n(BINARY)DIGITAL \nOUTPUT (HEX)\n+125 0111 1101 0000 0000 7D00h\n+25.0625 0001 1001 0001 0000 1910h\n+10.125 0000 1010 0010 0000 0A20h\n+0.5 0000 0000 1000 0000 0080h\n0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000h\n-0.5 1111 1111 1000 0000 FF80h\n-10.125 1111 0101 1110 0000 F5E0h\n-25.0625 1110 0110 1111 0000 E6F0h\n-55 1100 1001 0000 0000 C900h\nFigure 4.

T OUT remains at the \nupdated value until the next conversion completes. When \nthe measured temperature meets or exceeds the value \nstored in the upper trip-point register (T H), TOUT becomes \nactive and remains active until the measured temperature \nfalls below the value stored in the lower trip-point register \n(TL) (see Figure 5 ). This allows the user to program any \namount of hysteresis into the output response. The active \nstate of T OUT is user-programmable through the polarity \nbit (POL) in the configuration register.\nThe user-defined values in the T H and T L registers (see \nFigure 4) must be in two’s complement format with the \nMSb (bit 15) containing the sign bit (S). The T H and T L \nresolution is determined by the R0 and R1 bits in the \nconfiguration register (see Table 6 ), so the T H and T L \nresolution matches the output temperature resolution. For \nexample, for 10-bit resolution bits 5 through 0 of the T H \nand T L registers read out as 0 (even if 1s are written to \nthese bits), and the converted temperature is compared \nto the 10 MSbs of T H and T L. \nThe T H and T L registers are stored in EEPROM; there -\nfore, they are NV and can be programmed prior to device \ninstallation. Writing to and reading from the T H and T L \nregisters is achieved using the Access T H and Access \nTL commands. When making changes to the T H and T L \nregisters, conversions should first be stopped using the \nStop Convert T command if the device is in continuous \nconversion mode. Note that if the thermostat function is \nnot used, the T H and T L registers can be used as general-\npurpose NV memory.\nAnother thermostat feature is the temperature high and \nlow flags (THF and TLF) in the configuration register. \nThese bits provide a record of whether the temperature \nhas been greater than T H or less than T L at anytime since \nthe device was powered up. These bits power up as 0s, \nand if the temperature ever exceeds the T H register value, \nthe THF bit is set to 1, or if the temperature ever falls \nbelow the T L value, the TLF bit is set to 1. Once THF and/\nor TLF has been set, it remains set until overwritten with a \n0 by the user or until the power is cycled.Ds1631A Stand-Alone  \nThermostat Operation\nSince the DS1631A automatically begins taking tem -\nperature measurements at power-up, it can function as \na standalone thermostat (i.e., it can provide thermostatic \noperation without microcontroller communication). For \nstandalone operation, the NV T H and T L registers and the \nPOL and 1SHOT bits in the configuration register should \nbe programmed to the desired values prior to installation. \nSince the default conversion resolution at power-up is 12 \nbits (R1 = 1 and R0 = 1 in the configuration register), the \nconversion resolution is always 12 bits during standalone \nthermostat operation.\nConfiguration Register\nThe configuration register allows the user to program \nvarious DS1631 options such as conversion resolution, \nTOUT polarity, and operating mode. It also provides infor -\nmation to the user about conversion status, EEPROM \nactivity, and thermostat activity. The configuration register \nis arranged as shown in Figure 6  and detailed descrip -\ntions of each bit are provided in Table 5 . This register \ncan be read from and written to using the Access Config \ncommand. When writing to the configuration register, con -\nversions should first be stopped using the Stop Convert T \ncommand if the device is in continuous conversion mode. \nNote that the POL and 1SHOT bits are stored in EEPROM \nso they can be programmed prior to installation is desired. \nAll other configuration register bits are SRAM and power \nup in the state shown in Table 5 .\nFigure 5.

The master device gen -\nerates the SCL signal and START and STOP conditions.\nSlave:  All devices on the bus other than the master. The \nDS1631, DS1631A, and DS1731 always function as \nslaves.\nBus Idle or Not Busy:  Both SDA and SCL remain high. \nSDA is held high by a pullup resistor when the bus is idle, \nand SCL must either be forced high by the master (if the \nSCL output is push-pull) or pulled high by a pullup resistor \n(if the SCL output is open-drain).\nTransmitter:  A device (master or slave) that is sending \ndata on the bus. \nReceiver:  A device (master or slave) that is receiving data \nfrom the bus.\nSTART Condition:  Signal generated by the master to \nindicate the beginning of a data transfer on the bus. The \nmaster generates a START condition by pulling SDA from \nhigh to low while SCL is high (see Figure 8 ). A “repeated” \nSTART is sometimes used at the end of a data transfer \n(instead of a STOP) to indicate that the master will per -\nform another operation. \nSTOP Condition:  Signal generated by the master to \nindicate the end of a data transfer on the bus. The master \ngenerates a STOP condition by transitioning SDA from low \nto high while SCL is high (see Figure 8 ). After the STOP is \nissued, the master releases the bus to its idle state.\nAcknowledge (ACK):  When a device is acting as a \nreceiver, it must generate an acknowledge (ACK) on the \nSDA line after receiving every byte of data. The receiv -\ning device performs an ACK by pulling the SDA line low for an entire SCL period (see Figure 8 ). During the ACK \nclock cycle, the transmitting device must release SDA. \nA variation on the ACK signal is the “not acknowledge” \n(NACK). When the master device is acting as a receiver, \nit uses a NACK instead of an ACK after the last data byte \nto indicate that it is finished receiving data. The master \nindicates a NACK by leaving the SDA line high during the \nACK clock cycle.\nSlave Address:  Every slave device on the bus has a \nunique 7-bit address that allows the master to access \nthat device. The 7-bit bus address is 1 0 0 1 A 2 A1 A0, \nwhere A 2, A1, and A 0 are user-selectable through the \ncorresponding input pins. The three address pins allow \nup to eight DS1631s, DS1631As, or DS1731s to be mul -\ntidropped on the same bus. \nControl Byte:  The control byte is transmitted by the mas -\nter and consists of the 7-bit slave address plus a read/\nwrite (R/ W) bit (see Figure 7 ). If the master is going to read \ndata from the slave device then R/ W = 1, and if the master \nis going to write data to the slave device then R/ W = 0.\nCommand Byte:  The command byte can be any of the \ncommand protocols described in the Command Set  sec-\ntion of this data sheet.\nFigure 7.

Therefore, nine clocks are required \nfor every one-byte data transfer.\nInitiating 2-Wire Communication\nTo initiate 2-wire communication, the master generates a \nSTART followed by a control byte containing the DS1631, \nDS1631A, or DS1731 slave address. The R/ W bit of the \ncontrol byte must be a 0 (“write”) since the master next \nwrites a command byte. The DS1631/DS1631A/DS1731 \nresponds with an ACK after receiving the control byte. \nThis must be followed by a command byte from the mas -\nter, which indicates what type of operation is to be per -\nformed. The DS1631/DS1631A/DS1731 again respond \nwith an ACK after receiving the command byte.\nIf the command byte is a Start Convert T or Stop Convert \nT command (see Figure 9 ), the transaction is finished, \nand the master must issue a STOP to signal the end of \nthe communication sequence. If the command byte indi -\ncates a write or read operation, additional actions must \noccur as explained in the following sections.\n2-Wire Writes\nThe master can write data to the DS1631/DS1631A/\nDS1731 by issuing an Access Config, Access T H, or \nAccess T L command following the control byte (see \nFigures 9b and 9d). Since the R/ W bit in the control byte \nwas a 0 (“write”), the DS1631/DS1631A/DS1731 are \nalready prepared to receive data. Therefore, after receiv -\ning an ACK in response to the command byte, the master \ndevice can immediately begin transmitting data. When \nwriting to the configuration register, the master must \nsend one byte of data, and when writing to the T H or T L \nregisters the master must send two bytes of data. After \nreceiving each data byte, the DS1631/DS1631A/DS1731 \nrespond with an ACK, and the transaction is finished with \na STOP from the master.2-Wire Reads\nThe master can read data from the DS1631/DS1631A/\nDS1731 by issuing an Access Config, Access TH, Access \nTL, or Read Temperature command following the control \nbyte (see Figures 9c and 9e). After receiving an ACK in \nresponse to the command, the master must generate \na repeated START followed by a control byte with the \nsame slave address as the first control byte. However, \nthis time the R/ W bit must be a 1, which tells the DS1631/\nDS1631A/DS1731 that a “read” is being performed. After \nthe DS1631/DS1631A/DS1731 send an ACK in response \nto this control byte, it begins transmitting the requested \ndata on the next clock cycle. One byte of data will be trans -\nmitted when reading from the configuration register after \nwhich the master must respond with a NACK followed by a \nSTOP. For two-byte reads (i.e., from the Temperature, T H, \nor TL register), the master must respond to the first data \nbyte with an ACK and to the second byte with a NACK fol -\nlowed by a STOP. If only the most significant byte of data \nis needed, the master can issue a NACK followed by a \nSTOP after reading the first data byte.\nCommand Set\nThe DS1631/DS1631A/DS1731 command set is detailed \nbelow:\nStart Convert T [ 51h ]\nInitiates temperature conversions. If the part is in one-shot \nmode (1SHOT = 1), only one conversion is performed. In \ncontinuous mode (1SHOT = 0), continuous temperature \nconversions are performed until a Stop Convert T com -\nmand is issued.\nStop Convert T [ 22h ]  \nStops temperature conversions when the device is in \ncontinuous conversion mode (1SHOT = 0). \nRead Temperature [ AAh ]  \nReads last converted temperature value from the 2-byte \ntemperature register. \nAccess TH [ A1h ]  \nReads or writes the 2-byte T H register. \nAccess TL [ A2h ]  \nReads or writes the 2-byte T L register. \nAccess Config [ ACh ]  \nReads or writes the 1-byte configuration register. \nSoftware POR [ 54h ]  \nInitiates a software power-on-reset (POR), which stops \ntemperature conversions and resets all registers and \nlogic to their power-up states. The software POR allows \nthe user to simulate cycling the power without actually \npowering down the device.\nDS1631/DS1631A/\nDS1731High-Precision Digital\nThermometer and Thermostat\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 10\nFigure 9.
