KG:\nGeneral:\nAll recommendations according to the general technical specifications of the data sheet have to be complied with.\nThe usage and operation of the product within ambient conditions, which probably alloy or harm the component surface, has to be avoided.\nIf the product is potted in customer applications, the potting material might shrink during and after hardening. The product is exposed to the\npressure of the potting material with the effect that the LED body, pins or termination is possibly damaged by this pressure and so the\nelectrical as well as the mechanical characteristics are endangered to be affected. After the potting material is cured, the LED body, pins or\ntermination of the product have to be checked if any reduced electrical or mechanical functions or destructions have occurred.\nThe responsibility for the applicability of customer specific products and use in a particular customer design is always within the authority of\nthe customer. All technical specifications for standard products do also apply to customer specific products.\nWashing varnish agent that is used during the production to clean the customer application might damage or change the characteristics of\nthe LED body, pins or termination. The washing varnish agent could have a negative effect on the long term function of the product.\nDirect mechanical impact to the product shall be prevented as the material of the LED body, pins or termination could flake or in the worst\ncase it could break.\nThe standard deliveries include values in the range and limitation as defined in the Electrical  Optical Properties specified in the datasheet.\nOn each reel, only one bin is sorted and taped. The bin is defined on intensity, chromaticity coordinate or wavelength and forward voltage. In\norder to ensure highest availability, the reel binning of standard deliveries can vary. A single bin cannot be ordered. Please contact us in\nadvance, if you need a particular bin sorting before placing your order to clarify the lead time, MOQ and pricing.\nProduct specific:\nFollow all instructions mentioned in the data sheet, especially:\n•The soldering profile has to be complied with according to the technical reflow/ or wave soldering specification, otherwise this will void\nthe warranty.\n•All products shall be used before the end of the period of 12 months based on the product date code, if not a 100% solderability can´t\nbe ensured.\n•Violation of the technical product specifications such as exceeding the absolute maximum ratings will void the warranty.•It is also recommended to return the LEDs to the original moisture proof bag and reseal the moisture proof bag again.\n•Certain LED surfaces consist of soft material. Pressure on the top surface has to be handeled carefully to prevent negative influence to\nthe function and reliability of the LEDs.\n•ESD prevention methods need to be applicated for manual handling and processing by machinery.\n•Resistors for protection are obligatory.\n•Luminaires in operation could harm human vision or skin on a photo-biological level, therefore direct light impact has to be avoided. All\nproducts are additionally certified as risk groups 0 to 2 according to DIN EN 62471:2008.\nThe general and prodcut specific cautions comply with the state of the scientific and technical knowledge and are believed to be accurate\nand reliable; however, no responsibility is assumed for inaccuracies or incompleteness.\nWürth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co.

KG:\n1. General Customer Responsibility\nSome goods within the product range of Würth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co. KG contain statements regarding general suitability for certain\napplication areas. These statements about suitability are based on our knowledge and experience of typical requirements concerning the\nareas, serve as general guidance and cannot be estimated as binding statements about the suitability for a customer application. The\nresponsibility for the applicability and use in a particular customer design is always solely within the authority of the customer. Due to this\nfact it is up to the customer to evaluate, where appropriate to investigate and decide whether the device with the specific product\ncharacteristics described in the product specification is valid and suitable for the respective customer application or not.\n2. Customer Responsibility related to Specific, in particular Safety-Relevant Applications\nIt has to be clearly pointed out that the possibility of a malfunction of electronic components or failure before the end of the usual lifetime\ncannot be completely eliminated in the current state of the art, even if the products are operated within the range of the specifications.\nIn certain customer applications requiring a very high level of safety and especially in customer applications in which the malfunction or\nfailure of an electronic component could endanger human life or health it must be ensured by most advanced technological aid of suitable\ndesign of the customer application that no injury or damage is caused to third parties in the event of malfunction or failure of an electronic\ncomponent. Therefore, customer is cautioned to verify that data sheets are current before placing orders. The current data sheets can be\ndownloaded at www.we-online.com.\n3. Best Care and Attention\nAny product-specific notes, cautions and warnings must be strictly observed. Any disregard will result in the loss of warranty.\n4. Customer Support for Product Specifications\nSome products within the product range may contain substances which are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions in order to serve\nspecific technical requirements. Necessary information is available on request. In this case the field sales engineer or the internal sales\nperson in charge should be contacted who will be happy to support in this matter.\n5. Product R&D\nDue to constant product improvement product specifications may change from time to time. As a standard reporting procedure of the\nProduct Change Notification (PCN) according to the JEDEC-Standard inform about minor and major changes. In case of further queries\nregarding the PCN, the field sales engineer or the internal sales person in charge should be contacted. The basic responsibility of the\ncustomer as per Section 1 and 2 remains unaffected.6. Product Life Cycle\nDue to technical progress and economical evaluation we also reserve the right to discontinue production and delivery of products. As a\nstandard reporting procedure of the Product Termination Notification (PTN) according to the JEDEC-Standard we will inform at an early stage\nabout inevitable product discontinuance. According to this we cannot guarantee that all products within our product range will always be\navailable. Therefore it needs to be verified with the field sales engineer or the internal sales person in charge about the current product\navailability expectancy before or when the product for application design-in disposal is considered. The approach named above does not\napply in the case of individual agreements deviating from the foregoing for customer-specific products.\n7. Property Rights\nAll the rights for contractual products produced by Würth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co.
