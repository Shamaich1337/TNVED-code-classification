Input\noffset voltage (V OS) is only 300 µV maximum, while the output\nwill deliver ±5 mA to a load. Supply current is only 50 µA, while\nbandwidth is over 450 kHz and slew rate is 0.3 V/ µs. TPC 36 is\na simplified schematic of the OP196—it displays the novel cir-\ncuit design techniques used to achieve this performance.\nInput Overvoltage Protection\nThe OPx96 family of op amps uses a composite PNP/NPNinput stage. Transistor Q1 in Figure 36 has a collector-basevoltage of 0 V if +IN = V\nEE. If +IN then exceeds V EE, the junc-\ntion will be forward biased and large diode currents will flow,which may damage the device. The same situation applies to+IN on the base of transistor Q5 being driven above V\nCC. There-\nfore, the inverting and noninverting inputs must not be driven\nabove or below either supply rail unless the input current islimited.\nFigure 1 shows the input characteristics for the OPx96 family.\nThis photograph was generated with the power supply pins\nconnected to ground and a curve tracer’s collector output driveconnected to the input. As shown in the figure, when the input\nvoltage exceeds either supply by more than 0.6 V, internal\npn-junctions energize and permit current flow from the inputsto the supplies. If the current is not limited, the amplifier may\nbe damaged. To prevent damage, the input current should be\nlimited to no more than 5 mA.\n10\n0%100\n908\n642\n0\n–2\n–4\n–6\n–8\n–1.5 –1–0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5\nINPUT VOLTAGE – VINPUT CURRENT – mA\nFigure 1. Input Overvoltage I-V Characteristics of the\nOPx96 Family\nOutput Phase Reversal\nSome other operational amplifiers designed for single-supply\noperation exhibit an output voltage phase reversal when their\ninputs are driven beyond their useful common-mode range.\nTypically for single-supply bipolar op amps, the negative supplydetermines the lower limit of their common-mode range. With\nthese common-mode limited devices, external clamping diodes\nare required to prevent input signal excursions from exceedingthe device’s negative supply rail (i.e., GND) and triggering\noutput phase reversal.\nThe OPx96 family of op amps is free from output phase reversal\neffects due to its novel input structure. Figure 2 illustrates theperformance of the OPx96 op amps when the input is driven\nbeyond the supply rails. As previously mentioned, amplifier\ninput current must be limited if the inputs are driven beyondthe supply rails. In the circuit of Figure 2, the source ampli-tude is ±15 V, while the supply voltage is only ±5 V. In this\ncase, a 2 k Ω source resistor limits the input current to 5 mA.\n10\n0%100\n90 VS = \n5V\n AV = 15V\n1ms 5V0\n0VIN\nVOUTVOLTAGE –  5V/DIV\nTIME –  1ns/DIV\nFigure 2. Output Voltage Phase Reversal Behavior\nInput Offset Voltage Nulling\nThe OP196 provides two offset adjust terminals that can be\nused to null the amplifier’s internal V OS. In general, operational\namplifier terminals should never be used to adjust system offsetvoltages. A 100 k Ω potentiometer, connected as shown in Fig-\nure 3, is recommended to null the OP196’s offset voltage. Offset\nnulling does not adversely affect TCV\nOS performance, providing\nthat the trimming potentiometer temperature coefficient does\nnot exceed ±100 ppm/ °C.\n672\n3\nV–V+\nOP196\n100k/H90244\n15\nFigure 3.

In these\ncases, a false-ground can be created by using a voltage divider\nbuffered by an amplifier. One such circuit is shown in Figure 5.\nThis circuit will generate a false-ground reference at 1/2 of thesupply voltage, while drawing only about 55 µA from a 5 V\nsupply. The circuit includes compensation to allow for a 1 µF\nbypass capacitor at the false-ground output. The benefit of alarge capacitor is that not only does the false-ground present a\nvery low dc resistance to the load, but its ac impedance is low as well.\n62\n310k/H9024\nOP196100/H9024\n45V OR 12V\n0.022/H9262F\n1/H9262F 240k/H9024240k/H9024\n1/H9262F2.5V OR 6V7\nFigure 5.

Single-Supply Half-Wave and Full-Wave\nRectifiers Using an OP296\nThe circuit works as follows: When the input signal is above\n0 V, the output of amplifier A1 follows the input signal. Since\nthe noninverting input of amplifier A2 is connected to A1’soutput, op amp loop control forces A2’s inverting input to the\nsame potential. The result is that both terminals of R1 are at thesame potential and no current flows in R1. Since there is no\ncurrent flow in R1, the same condition must exist in R2; thus,the output of the circuit tracks the input signal. When the input\nsignal is below 0 V, the output voltage of A1 is forced to 0 V.\nThis condition now forces A2 to operate as an inverting voltagefollower because the noninverting terminal of A2 is also at 0 V.\nThe output voltage of V\nOUTA is then a full-wave rectified\nversion of the input signal. A resistor in series with A1’s\nnoninverting input protects the ESD diodes when the inputsignal goes below ground.\nSquare Wave Oscillator\nThe oscillator circuit in Figure 7 demonstrates how a rail-to-rail\noutput swing can reduce the effects of power supply variations\non the oscillator’s frequency. This feature is especially valuable\nin battery powered applications, where voltage regulation maynot be available. The output frequency remains stable as the\nsupply voltage changes because the RC charging current, which\nis derived from the rail-to-rail output, is proportional to thesupply voltage. Since the Schmitt trigger threshold level is also\nproportional to supply voltage, the frequency remains relatively\nindependent of supply voltage. For a supply voltage changefrom 9 V to 5 V, the output frequency only changes about 4 Hz.\nThe slew rate of the amplifier limits the oscillation frequency to\na maximum of about 200 Hz at a supply voltage of 5 V.\n59k/H9024\n1/2\nOP296/OP496100k/H9024100k/H9024\nFREQ OUT\nfOSC =       < 200Hz @ V+ = 5V1\nRC\nCV+\nR23\n48\n1\nFigure 7.

The regu-lator can deliver 50 mA load current while allowing a 0.2 Vdropout voltage. The OP296’s rail-to-rail output swing easily\ndrives the MJE350 pass transistor without requiring special\ndrive circuitry. With no load, its output can swing to less thanthe pass transistor’s base-emitter voltage, turning the device\nnearly off. At full load, and at low emitter-collector voltages, the\ntransistor beta tends to decrease. The additional base current iseasily handled by the OP296 output.\nThe AD589 provides a 1.235 V reference voltage for the regula-\ntor. The OP296, operating with a noninverting gain of 2.43,\ndrives the base of the MJE350 to produce an output voltage of3.0 V. Since the MJE350 operates in an inverting (common-\nemitter) mode, the output feedback is applied to the OP296’s\nnoninverting input.\n\nOP196/OP296/OP496\nREV. –14–1/2\nOP296\n413\n28\n1000pF44.2k/H9024\n1%\n30.9k/H90241%\nAD58943k/H9024 1.235VMJE 350\n100/H9262FVIN\n5V TO 3.2VIL < 50mA\nVO\nFigure 8. 3 V Low Dropout Voltage Regulator\nFigure 9 shows the regulator’s recovery characteristics when its\noutput underwent a 20 mA to 50 mA step current change.\n10\n0%100\n902V\n50µs 10mV50mA\n30mA\nOUTPUTSTEP\nCURRENT\nCONTROL\nWAVEFORM\nFigure 9.

In this circuit DAC C provides the coarseoutput voltage setting and DAC B is used for fine adjustment.\nThe insertion of R1 in series with DAC B attenuates its contri-\nbution to the voltage sum node at the DAC C output.\nA High-Side Current Monitor\nIn the design of power supply control circuits, a great deal of\ndesign effort is focused on ensuring a pass transistor’s long-term\nreliability over a wide range of load current conditions. As a result,monitoring and limiting device power dissipation is of prime\nimportance in these designs. The circuit illustrated in Figure 11\nis an example of a 5 V, single-supply high-side current monitorthat can be incorporated into the design of a voltage regulator\nwith fold-back current limiting or a high current power supply\nwith crowbar protection. This design uses an OP296’s rail-to-rail input voltage range to sense the voltage drop across a 0.1 Ω\ncurrent shunt. A p-channel MOSFET is used as the feedbackelement in the circuit to convert the op amp’s differential inputvoltage into a current. This current is then applied to R2 to gen-\nerate a voltage that is a linear representation of the load current.\nThe transfer equation for the current monitor is given by:\n    Monitor Output =R2×RSENSE\nR1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7×IL\nFor the element values shown, the Monitor Output’s transfer\ncharacteristic is 2.5 V/A.\n8\n1\n23\n41/2\nOP2965V5V\nS\nG\nDM1\n3N163\nMONITOR\nOUTPUTR2\n2.49k/H9024R1\n100/H9024RSENSE\n0.1/H9024IL\n5V\nFigure 11. A High-Side Load Current Monitor\nA Single-Supply RTD Amplifier\nThe circuit in Figure 12 uses three op amps on the OP496 toproduce a bridge driver for an RTD amplifier while operating\nfrom a single 5 V supply. The circuit takes advantage of the\nOP496’s wide output swing to generate a bridge excitationvoltage of 3.9 V. An AD589 pr ovides a 1.235 V reference for\nthe bridge current. Op amp A1 drives the bridge to maintain1.235 V across the parallel combination of the 6.19 k Ω and\n2.55 M Ω resistors, which generates a 200 µA current source.\nThis current divides evenly and flows through both halves of\nthe bridge. Thus, 100 µA flows through the RTD to generate\nan output voltage which is proportional to its resistance. For\nimproved accuracy, a 3-wire RTD is recommended to balancethe line resistance in both 100 Ω legs of the bridge.\nTrimDAC is a registered trademark of Analog Devices Inc.\n\nOP196/OP296/OP496\nREV. –15–* OP496 SPICE Macro-model REV.
