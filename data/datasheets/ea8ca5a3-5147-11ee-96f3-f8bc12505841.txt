The external VCXO provides the low\nnoise reference required by PLL2 to achieve the restrictive phase\nnoise and jitter requirements necessary to achieve acceptable per-\nformance. The on-chip VCO tunes from 3.450 GHz to 4.025 GHz.\nThe integrated SYSREF generator outputs single shot, N-shot, or\ncontinuous signals synchronous to the PLL1 and PLL2 outputs to\ntime align multiple devices.\nThe AD9528  generates six outputs (Output 0 to Output 3, Output\n12, and Output 13) with a maximum frequency of 1.25 GHz, and\neight outputs with a maximum frequency of up to 1 GHz. Each\noutput can be configured to output directly from PLL1, PLL2, or\nthe internal SYSREF generator. Each of the 14 output channels\ncontains a divider with coarse digital phase adjustment and an\nanalog fine phase delay block that allows complete flexibility in\ntiming alignment across all 14 outputs. The AD9528  can also be\nused as a dual input flexible buffer to distribute 14 device clock\nand/or SYSREF signals. At power-up, the AD9528  sends the VCXO\nsignal directly to Output 12 and Output 13 to serve as the power-up\nready clocks.\nNote that, throughout this data sheet, the dual function pin names\nare referenced by the relevant function where applicable.\nData Sheet AD9528\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

F | 24 of 67Phase Jitter\nAn ideal sine wave has a continuous and even progression of\nphase with time from 0° to 360° for each cycle. Actual signals,\nhowever, display a certain amount of variation from ideal phase\nprogression over time. This phenomenon is called phase jitter.\nAlthough many causes can contribute to phase jitter, one major\ncause is random noise, which is characterized statistically as being\nGaussian (normal) in distribution.\nPhase jitter leads to a spreading out of the energy of the sine wave\nin the frequency domain, producing a continuous power spectrum.\nThis power spectrum is usually reported as a series of values with\nthe units dBc/Hz at a given offset in frequency from the sine wave\n(carrier). The value is a ratio (expressed in decibels) of the power\ncontained within a 1 Hz bandwidth with respect to the power at the\ncarrier frequency. For each measurement, the offset from the carrier\nfrequency is also given.\nIn some applications, it is meaningful to integrate only the total\npower contained within some interval of offset frequencies (for\nexample, 10 kHz to 10 MHz). This is called the integrated phase\nnoise over that frequency offset interval and can be readily related\nto the time jitter due to the phase noise within that offset frequency\ninterval.\nPhase Noise\nPhase noise has a detrimental effect on the performance of analog-\nto-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs),\nand radio frequency (RF) mixers. It lowers the achievable dynamic\nrange of the converters and mixers, although they are affected in\nsomewhat different ways.\nTime Jitter\nPhase noise is a frequency domain phenomenon. In the time\ndomain, the same effect is exhibited as time jitter. When observing\na sine wave, the time of successive zero crossings varies. In\na square wave, the time jitter is a displacement of the edges\nfrom their ideal (regular) times of occurrence. In both cases, the\nvariations in timing from the ideal are the time jitter. Because\nthese variations are random in nature, the time jitter is specified\nin seconds root mean square (rms) or 1 sigma of the Gaussian\ndistribution.\nTime jitter that occurs on a sampling clock for a DAC or an\nADC decreases the SNR and dynamic range of the converter. A\nsampling clock with the lowest possible jitter provides the highest\nperformance from a given converter.\nAdditive Phase Noise\nAdditive phase noise is the amount of phase noise that is attributa-\nble to the device or subsystem being measured. The phase noise\nof any external oscillators or clock sources is subtracted. This\nmakes it possible to predict the degree to which the device impacts\nthe total system phase noise when used in conjunction with thevarious oscillators and clock sources, each of which contributes its\nown phase noise to the total. In many cases, the phase noise of\none element dominates the system phase noise. When there are\nmultiple contributors to phase noise, the total is the square root of\nthe sum of squares of the individual contributors.\nAdditive Time Jitter\nAdditive time jitter is the amount of time jitter that is attributable\nto the device or subsystem being measured. The time jitter of any\nexternal oscillators or clock sources is subtracted. This makes it\npossible to predict the degree to which the device impacts the\ntotal system time jitter when used in conjunction with the various\noscillators and clock sources, each of which contributes its own\ntime jitter to the total. In many cases, the time jitter of the external\noscillators and clock sources dominates the system time jitter.\nData Sheet AD9528\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 25 of 67DETAILED BLOCK DIAGRAM\nFigure 27. Top Level Diagram\nOVERVIEW\nThe AD9528  is a clock generator that employs integer-N based\nphase-locked loops (PLL). The device architecture consists of two\ncascaded PLL stages. PLL1 consists of an integer division PLL that\nuses an external voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO). PLL1\nhas a narrow loop bandwidth that provides initial jitter cleanup of\nthe input reference signal for the input stage of PLL2. Conversely,\nthe output of PLL1 is also routable to any clock distribution output, if\ndesired.\nPLL2 is a frequency multiplying PLL that translates the first PLL\nstage output frequency to a range of 3.450 GHz to 4.025 GHz.\nPLL2 incorporates an integer based feedback divider that enables\ninteger frequency multiplication. An RF VCO divider (3, 4, or 5)\ndivides the VCO output of PLL2 before being routed to the input of\nthe clock distribution section. Programmable integer dividers (1 to\n256) in the clock distribution follow the RF VCO divider, establishing\na final output frequency up to 1 GHz or less for the 8 available\noutputs. The OUT0 to OUT3, OUT12, and OUT13 outputs can run\nup to 1.25 GHz.\nAll of the divider settings in the clock distribution section are\nconfigurable via the serial programming port, enabling a wide range\nof input/output frequency ratios under program control. The dividers\nalso include a programmable coarse delay to adjust timing of\nthe output signals, if required. In addition, a fine delay adjust is\navailable in the clock distribution path.\nThe outputs are compatible with LVDS and HSTL logic levels. The\nAD9528  can produce a JESD204B/JESD204C SYSREF signal.\nThis signal can be routed to any of the 14 outputs. The AD9528  canalso receive an externally generated SYSREF signal and buffer to\nthe outputs, with or without retiming. The AD9528  operates over the\nextended industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C.\nThe AD9528  includes reference monitoring and automatic/manual\nswitchover and holdover. A reference select pin is available to\nmanually select which input reference is active. The accuracy of the\nholdover is dependent on the external VCXO frequency stability.\nAll power supply pins on the AD9528  operate on a 3.3 V ±5%\nsupply domain. However, each power supply pin has a dedicated\ninternal LDO regulator that provides approximately 1.8 V for stand-\nard operation of the device. These independent regulators provide\nextra supply rejection and help with output to output coupling, since\nnone of the output drivers or dividers share a supply.\nCOMPONENT BLOCKS—PLL1\nPLL1 General Description\nPLL1 consists of a phase/frequency detector (PFD), a charge\npump, an external VCXO, and a partially external loop filter operat-\ning in a closed loop.\nPLL1 has the flexibility to operate with a narrow loop bandwidth.\nThis relatively narrow loop bandwidth gives the AD9528  the ability\nto suppress jitter that appears on the input references (REFA and\nREFB). The low phase noise output of PLL1 acts as the reference\nto PLL2 and can be routed to the clock distribution section.\nData Sheet AD9528\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 26 of 67PLL1 Reference Clock Inputs\nThe AD9528  features two separate reference clock inputs, REFA\nand REFB. These inputs can be configured to accept differential or\nsingle-ended signals. REFA and REFB are self biased in differential\nmode and high impedance in single-ended CMOS mode. If REFA\nor REFB is driven single-ended, decouple the unused side ( REFA ,\nREFB ) via a suitable capacitor to a quiet ground. These inputs may\nbe dc-coupled, but set the dc operation point as specified in the\nSpecifications  section.\nThe differential reference input receiver is powered down when the\ndifferential reference input is not selected, or when the PLL1 is pow-\nered down. The single-ended buffers power down when the PLL1\nis powered down, when their respective individual power-down\nregisters are set, or when the differential receiver is selected.\nPLL1 Loop Filter\nThe PLL1 loop filter is mostly external from LF1 (Pin 7) to ground.\nThe value of the external components depend on the external\nVCXO and the configuration parameters, such as input clock rate\nand desired PLL1 loop bandwidth.\nFigure 28. PLL1 Loop Filter\nAn external RC low-pass filter is recommended at the VCXO_VT\noutput for the best noise performance at 1 kHz offset. The pole\nof this filter must be sufficiently high enough in frequency to avoid\nstability problems with the PLL loop bandwidth.\nFigure 29. Input PLL (PLL1) Block DiagramPLL1 Input Dividers\nEach reference input has a dedicated reference divider block. The\ninput dividers provide division of the reference frequency in integer\nsteps from 1 to 1023.\nVCXO Input\nThe VCXO receiver provides the low phase noise oscillator input for\nPLL1. This signal is also the reference input for PLL2. In addition,\nthe VCXO input is used when either PLL1 is bypassed, or PLL1 and\nPLL2 are bypassed to use the AD9528  as a buffer.\nPLL1 Reference Switchover\nThe reference monitor verifies the presence or absence of the\nREFA and REFB signals. The status of the reference monitor\nguides the activity of the switchover control logic. The AD9528  sup-\nports automatic and manual PLL reference clock switching between\nREFA (the REFA and REFA  pins) and REFB (the REFB and REFB\npins).\nThere are several configurable modes of reference switchover. The\nmanual switchover is achieved either via programming a register\nsetting or by using the REF_SEL pin. If manually selecting REFB,\nREFB must be present prior to when the switchover to REFB\noccurs. The automatic switchover occurs when REFA disappears\nand a reference is on REFB. PLL1 operates with REFA as the\nprimary reference input; this is relevant to the switchover operation\nof the device.\nThe reference switchover circuitry recognizes that REFA is the\nmaster reference. For the reference monitoring circuitry to work\nproperly, REFA must be present during initial locking, regardless of\nwhether REFB is present or not. When both references are used,\nREFA and REFB must be present. When a single reference is\nused, the reference must be REFA.\nThe reference automatic switchover can be set to work as follows:\n►Nonrevertive. Stay on REFB. Switch from REFA to REFB when\nREFA disappears, but do not switch back to REFA if it reappears.\nIf REFB disappears, then go back to REFA.\n►Revert to REFA. Switch from REFA to REFB when REFA disap-\npears. Return to REFA from REFB when REFA returns.\n►If a switchover event occurs in nonrevertive mode and the\nmissing input to REFA is reestablished, the return of the missing\nreference does not reset the nonrevertive switchover logic. The\nresult of this setup is that, if REFB is selected during nonrever-\ntive switchover mode and nonrevertive switchover is disabled\nand reenabled, REFB is still the active reference, regardless if\nREFA is present. The switchover logic can be reset by issuing a\ndevice reset.\nData Sheet AD9528\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 27 of 67PLL1 Holdover\nIn the absence of both input references, the device enters holdover\nmode. When the device switches to holdover mode, the charge\npump tristates, allowing VCXO_VT to maintain its existing value for\na period of time. Optionally, the charge pump can be programmed\nto force VCXO_VT to VDD/2. The device continues operating in\nthis mode until a reference signal becomes available. Then the\ndevice exits holdover mode, and PLL1 resynchronizes with the\nactive reference. Automatic holdover mode can be disabled with a\nregister bit. PLL2 remains locked to the VCXO signal even when\nPLL1 is in holdover.\nPLL1 Lock Time\nThe typical PLL1 lock time occurs within 5× the period of the loop\nbandwidth, assuming a third-order loop filter with a phase margin of\n55°. It may take up to 10× the period of the loop bandwidth for the\nPLL1 lock detector circuit to show locked status.\nCalculate PLL1_TO in Figure 52  as     PLL1_TO  = 10/LBWPLL1\nwhere:\nPLL1_TO  is the PLL1 timeout.\nLBWPLL1 is the loop bandwidth of PLL1.\nCOMPONENT BLOCKS—PLL2\nPLL2 General Description\nPLL2 consists of an optional input reference 2× multiplier, reference\ndivider, a PFD, a mostly integrated analog loop filter, an integrated\nvoltage controlled oscillator (VCO), and a feedback divider. The\nVCO produces a nominal 3.8 GHz signal with an output divider that\nis capable of division ratios of 3, 4, and 5.\nPLL2 has a VCO with multiple bands spanning a range of\n3.450 GHz to 4.025 GHz. The device automatically selects the\nappropriate band as part of its calibration process.\nFigure 30. PLL2 Block Diagram\nData Sheet AD9528\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 28 of 67PLL2 Input 2× Frequency Multiplier\nThe 2× frequency multiplier provides the option to double the\nfrequency at the PLL2 reference input. A higher frequency at the\ninput to the PLL2 (PFD) allows reduced in-band phase noise and\ngreater separation between the frequency generated by the PLL\nand the modulation spur associated with the PFD. Note that, as\nthe input duty cycle deviates from 50%, harmonic distortion may\nincrease. As such, beneficial use of the frequency multiplier is\napplication specific. Typically, a VCXO with proper interfacing has a\nduty cycle that is approximately 50% at the VCXO_IN inputs. Note\nthat the maximum output frequency of the 2× frequency multipliers\nmust not exceed the maximum PFD rate specified in Table 7 .\nIf the 2× frequency multiplier is used, a fixed phase offset can occur\nfrom power-up to power-up between the input to the 2× frequency\nmultiplier and the PLL2 PFD reference input. This presents the\npossibility for a fixed phase offset between the VCXO_IN frequency\nand PLL2 output of ½ the period of the signal applied to the\nVCXO_IN and VCXO_IN  pins. If the internal SYSREF generator\nis used, choose the PLL2 feedback path as the input signal of\nthe SYSREF generator to ensure fixed phase alignment of the\nSYSREF generator from power-up to power-up.\nPLL2 Input Reference Divider\nThe input reference divider (R1) provides division in integer steps\nfrom 1 to 31 with a maximum input frequency of 275 MHz. The\ndivider provides an option to prescale the PFD rate of PLL2 for\noutput frequency planning and to accommodate more flexibility for\nsetting the desired loop bandwidth for PLL2.\nIf the R1 divider is used along with the SYSREF generator, choose\nthe PLL2 feedback path as the input signal of the SYSREF genera-\ntor to ensure fixed phase alignment of the SYSREF generator from\npower-up to power-up. \nPLL2 Feedback Dividers\nPLL2 has two feedback paths as shown in Figure 30 . In normal\nPLL2 operation mode, the PLL2 feedback path consists of N2 (an\n8-bit divider) and M1 (a VCO RF divider). The product of N2 and\nM1 establishes the total PLL multiplication value for PLL2.\nThe second feedback path for PLL2 uses the VCO CAL divider (see\nFigure 30 ). The VCO CAL divider is exclusively used to calibrate\nthe internal VCO of PLL2. Register 0x0201, Register 0x0204, Reg-\nister 0x0207, and Register 0x0208 program the PLL multiplication\nvalues for both PLL2 feedback paths.\nThe total PLL multiplication in both feedback paths must equal one\nanother for proper VCO calibration. After each VCO calibration, the\nVCO CAL divider feedback path automatically disables and reverts\nback to the feedback path with N2 and M1 dividers for normal\noperation. The VCO CAL divider is not available outside of VCO\ncalibration.The VCO CAL divider consists of a prescaler (P) divider and two\ncounters, A and B. The total divider value is\n     VCO CAL divider = (P × B) + A\nwhere P = 4.\nThe VCO CAL feedback divider has a dual modulus prescaler\narchitecture with a nonprogrammable P that is equal to 4. The value\nof the B counter can be from 3 to 63, and the value of the A counter\ncan be from 0 to 3. 16 is the minimum supported divide value.\nThe VCO RF divider (M1) provides frequency division between the\ninternal VCO and the clock distribution. The VCO RF divider can be\nset to divide by 3, 4, or 5. The VCO RF divider is part of the total\nPLL2 feedback path value for normal operation.\nPLL2 Loop Filter\nThe PLL2 loop filter requires the connection of an external capacitor\nfrom LF2_CAP (Pin 14) to LDO_VCO (Pin 15). The value of the\nexternal capacitor depends on the operating mode and the desired\nphase noise performance. For example, a loop bandwidth of ap-\nproximately 500 kHz produces the lowest integrated jitter. A lower\nbandwidth produces lower phase noise at 1 MHz but increases the\ntotal integrated jitter\nFigure 31. PLL2 Loop Filter\nTable 22.

The VCO\noperates off the VCO LDO supply. This LDO requires an external\nData Sheet AD9528\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 29 of 67compensation cap of 0.47 μF to ground. The VCO requires calibra-\ntion prior to use.\nVCO Calibration\nThe AD9528  on-chip VCO must be manually calibrated to ensure\nproper PLL2 operation over process, supply, and temperature.\nVCO calibration requires a valid VCXO input clock and applicable\npreprogrammed PLL1 and PLL2 register values prior to issuing the\nVCO calibration to ensure a PLL2 phase lock condition.\nIn addition, the value of the VCO CAL feedback divider (see Figure\n30) must equal the combined divider values of both the 8-bit N2\ndivider and RF VCO divider (M1). For example, if the N2 divide\nvalue is 10 and the M1 divide value is 3, the total PLL2 multipli-\ncation value is 30 in normal operation, so the VCO CAL divider\nvalue must be set to 30 prior to initiating a VCO calibration. See\nthe PLL2 Feedback Dividers  section for more details. When total\nPLL2 feedback divider value is 15, see Figure 53  for the detailed\nprocedure.\nVCO calibration is initiated by transitioning the calibrate VCO bit\n(Bit 0 of Register 0x0203) from 0 to 1 (this bit is not self clearing).\nThe setting can be performed as part of the initial setup before\nexecuting the IO_UPDATE bit (Register 0x000F, Bit 0 = 1). A\nreadback bit, VCO calibration in progress (Register 0x0509, Bit 0),\nindicates when a VCO calibration is in progress by returning a\nlogic true (that is, Bit 0 = 1), however this bit is automatically\ncleared after the calibration is finished, so it tells if the calibration\nstarted but did not finish. After calibration, initiate a sync (see the\nClock Distribution Synchronization  section). Synchronization occurs\nautomatically on the first VCO calibration following a power-up or\nreset. See Figure 53  for the detailed procedure.\nDuring power-up or reset, channels driven by the RF VCO driver\nare automatically held in sync until the first VCO calibration is\nfinished. Therefore, none of those channel outputs can occur until\nVCO calibration is complete.\nInitiate a VCO calibration under the following conditions:\n►After changing the PLL2 N2 or M1 divider settings or after a\nchange in the PLL2 reference clock frequency. This means that a\nVCO calibration must be initiated any time that a PLL2 register or\nreference clock changes such that a different VCO frequency is\nthe result.\n►Whenever system calibration is desired. The VCO is designed to\noperate properly over temperature extremes, even when it is first\ncalibrated at the opposite extreme. However, a VCO calibration\ncan be initiated at any time.\nTo calibrate using the 2× multiplier, the total feedback divide must\nbe >16. If the application requires the use of a feedback divide\nvalue <16, see the following example:\nFor fVCXO = 122.88 MHz, fVCO = 3686.4 MHz, M1 = 3, N2 = 5, and\nwith the 2× multiplier enabled, the total feedback divider value of\n15 is less than the supported minimum for the calibration divider.To calibrate, the 2× multiplier must be disabled, and the calibration\ndivider must be set to 30. After the calibration is complete, the 2×\nmultiplier is enabled and the PLL acquires lock.\nPLL2 Lock Time/VCO Calibration Time\nThe typical PLL2 lock time occurs within 5× the period of the loop\nbandwidth, assuming a phase margin of 55°. It can take up to 10×\nthe period of the loop bandwidth for the PLL2 lock detector circuit\nto show locked status. The typical PLL2 VCO calibration time is\n400,000 periods of the PLL2 PFD rate.\nCalculate PLL2_TO in Figure 52  as\n     PLL2_TO  = 10/LBWPLL2 + 400,000/ fPFD_PLL2\nwhere fPFD_PLL2  is the frequency of the PLL2 phase detector.\nCLOCK DISTRIBUTION\nThe clock distribution consists of 14 individual channels (OUT0 to\nOUT13). The input frequency source for each channel output is\nselectable as either the PLL1 output, PLL2 output, or SYSREF.\nEach of the output channels also includes a dedicated 8-bit divider,\ntwo dedicated phase delay elements and an output driver, as\nshown in Figure 32 .\nFigure 32. Clock Distribution Paths for PLL1, PLL2, and SYSREF Frequency\nSources\nThe following are various channel limitations, depending on the\nchannel configuration:\n►Analog fine delay is supported for all channels, regardless of the\ninput frequency source selected.\n►Digital coarse delay is only supported when the channel divider\nis used. When SYSREF is used as the frequency source, the\nsignal must be retimed by the output of the channel divider to\nuse the digital coarse delay.\n►Output channel synchronization is performed by synchronously\nresetting the 8-bit channel divider via the sync outputs bit in\nRegister 0x032A, Bit 0. Therefore, the 8-bit divider path must\nbe used to support synchronization. If SYSREF is the frequency\nsource to an output, the SYSREF signal must be resampled by\nthe output of the channel divider for a SYNC to occur.\nClock Dividers\nThe output clock distribution dividers are referred to as D0 to\nD13, corresponding to output channels OUT0 through OUT13,\nrespectively. Each divider is programmable with 8 bits of precision\nData Sheet AD9528\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 30 of 67equal to any number from 1 through 256. Dividers have duty cycle\ncorrection set to provide nominal 50% duty cycle, even for odd\ndivides. Note that a sync output command must be issued after\nchanging the divide value to ensure the intended divide ratio occurs\nat the channel output(s).\nDigital Coarse Delay\nThe AD9528  supports programmable phase offsets from 0 to 63\nsteps (6 bits) in half period increments of the RF VCO divider output\nfrequency. Note that a sync output command must be issued after\nthe new phase offset(s) are programmed to ensure the intended\nphase offset occurs at the channel output(s). This is accomplished\nby programming the new phase offset and then issuing a sync\ncommand via Register 0x032A, Bit 0. All outputs are disabled tem-\nporarily while the sync is active, unless the channel is programmed\nto ignore the sync command. The ignore sync command for each\nchannel is controlled via Register 0x032B and Register 0x032C.\nAnalog Fine Delay\nEach channel includes a 4-bit fine analog delay block intended to\nprovide substantially smaller delay steps compared to the half cycle\nof the RF VCO divider output. The fine analog delay enable bit in\neach channel activates the fine delay path; when the enable bit\nis asserted with the four delay bits = 0000, the minimum insertion\ndelay is nominally 425 ps. Full-scale delay = 1111 adds another\n496 ps of additional delay. The average fine delay resolution step is\napproximately 31 ps.\nOutput Channel Power-Down\nEach output channel has independent power-down control via\nRegister 0x0501 and Register 0x0502. The total device power\nis reduced with each channel powered down, keeping the output\nstatic until the user is ready to disable the channel power-down\ncontrol. In addition, Register 0x0503 and Register 0x0504 offer\nadditional power savings via LDO power-down control for each\nchannel output.\nOutput Drivers\nEach channel and corresponding output driver has a dedicated\ninternal LDO to power both the channel and output driver. The\nequivalent output driver circuits are shown in Figure 33  and Figure\n34. The output driver design supports a common external 100 Ω\ndifferential resistor for both HSTL and LVDS driver modes. In LVDS\nmode, a current of 3.5 mA causes a 350 mV peak voltage across\nthe 100 Ω load resistor. In LVDS boost mode, a current of 4.5 mA\ncauses a 450 mV peak voltage across the 100 Ω load resistor.\nSimilarly, in HSTL mode, a current of 9 mA causes a 900 mV peak\nvoltage across the 100 Ω load resistor.Figure 33. LVDS Output Driver\nFigure 34. HSTL Output Driver\nClock Distribution Synchronization\nA block diagram of the clock distribution synchronization functionali-\nty is shown in Figure 35 . The synchronization feature edge aligns\nall outputs together or forces a desired phase offset between output\nedges. An automatic synchronization of the channel dividers is\ninitiated the first time the PLL2 locks after a power-up or reset\nevent. Subsequent lock and unlock events do not initiate a resynch-\nronization unless preceded by a power-down or reset of the device.\nAll outputs are disabled temporarily while the sync output bit in\nRegister 0x032A, Bit 0 is active, unless the channel is programmed\nto ignore the sync output command. The ignore sync command\nfor each channel is controlled via Register 0x032B and Regis-\nter 0x032C.\nWhen using the sync output bit to synchronize outputs, first set\nand then clear the bit. The synchronization event is the clearing\noperation (that is, the Logic 1 to Logic 0 transition of the bit). The\nchannel dividers are automatically synchronized to each other when\nPLL2 is ready.\nData Sheet AD9528\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 31 of 67In normal operation, the phase offsets are already programmed\nthrough the SPI/I2C port before the AD9528  starts to provide out-\nputs. Although the digital coarse phase offsets cannot be adjusted\nwhile the dividers are operating, it is possible to adjust the phase ofall outputs relative to each other without powering down PLL1 and\nPLL2. This is accomplished by programming the new phase offset\nusing Bits[5:0] in the clock distribution registers, and then issuing an\noutput sync by using the sync outputs bit (Register 0x032A, Bit 0).\nFigure 35. Clock Distribution Synchronization Block Diagram\nFigure 36. Clock Output Synchronization Timing Diagram\nData Sheet AD9528\nSYSREF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 32 of 67The AD9528  supports the JESD204B/JESD204C standard for syn-\nchronizing high speed converters and logic devices such as FPGAs\nby providing paired device clock and SYSREF clock signals. The\nSYSREF clock or device clock can be distributed to any one or\nmore of the 14 outputs via the clock distribution section within the\nAD9528 . After the SYSREF clock reaches the clock distribution\nsection, programmable digital coarse delay and/or analog fine de-\nlay is available to adjust timing between the SYSREF clock with\nrespect to the device clock. The delay establishes proper setup and\nhold timing downstream between device clock and SYSREF clock\nat the inputs of the converter(s) or logic device(s).\nSYSREF SIGNAL PATH\nThe AD9528  provides two sources for the purpose of generating\na SYSREF signal. The first source is a user provided external\nSYSREF clock signal applied to SYSREF_IN and SYSREF_IN  (Pin\n70 and Pin 71, respectively). The second source is an internal\nSYSREF generation circuit that enables the user to specify an inter-nally generated pulse pattern. There are three modes of operation\nassociated with the two sources as defined by Register 0x0403,\nBits[7:6].\n►00 = Mode 1 (external SYSREF)\n►01 = Mode 2 (external SYSREF resampled by the VCXO or\nPLL2 feedback divider)\n►1x = Mode 3 (internally generated SYSREF).\nSYSREF Mode 1: External\nFigure 37  shows the SYSREF clock path with Mode 1 selected.\nApply an external SYSREF clock signal to the SYSREF_IN and/ or\nSYSREF_IN  pin(s). A single-ended signal may be applied to either\npin separately or a differential signal may be applied across both\npins. Note that the SYSREF_REQ pin and Bit 0 of Register 0x0403\n(SPI SYSREF Request) are unused in Mode 1.\nFigure 37.

A\nSYSREF request can be made via hardware (the SYSREF_REQ\npin) or software (Register 0x0403, Bit 0, the SPI SYSREF request\nbit). In internal SYSREF mode, PLL2 must be locked before the\nSYSREF request signal is used if PLL2 feedback divider is used as\nSYSREF generator input. If PLL1 output (that is VCXO_IN) is used\nas SYSREF generator input, PLL1 must be locked. If PLL1 is not\nused, SYSREF can be generated through the VCXO_IN only.\nFigure 38.

F | 34 of 67SYSREF GENERATOR\nThe SYSREF pattern generator produces a user defined SYSREF\nsignal (see Table 23 ). The input clock to the pattern generator is\nprovided by the signal originating at the VCXO_IN and VCXO_IN\npins, or with the signal at the feedback node of PLL2. The pattern\ngenerator contains a fixed divide by 2 followed by a programmable\n16-bit K divider (set by Register 0x0401 and Register 0x0400) to\nprogram the pulse width of the SYSREF. The value of K ranges\nfrom 0 to 65535. Therefore, the total division factor is 2 × K, twice\nthe value programmed in the K divider registers. For example, if the\npattern generator input clock is 122.88 MHz, the maximum SYS-\nREF period is 131,070/122,880,000 seconds (1066 μs). The pattern\ngenerator acts as a timer that only issues pulses synchronous to\nall other outputs, regardless of when an asynchronous SYSREF\nrequest is issued.\nSYSREF Request\nThe SYSREF request signal starts or stops the internal SYSREF\npattern generator. The signal is controlled by software or via\npin control. The SYSREF request method is controlled by Regis-\nter 0x0402, Bit 7.\nSoftware Control\nIn software control mode, the SYSREF pattern generator is always\nlevel trigger sensitive to the SYSREF pattern generator trigger\ncontrol bits (Register 0x402, Bits[6:5]). With Bit 6 = 0 for level\ntrigger mode, Bit 5 is used as the trigger. If N-shot mode is enabled,\nset Bit 5 = 1 from 0 to start the SYSREF pattern sequence. After\nthe sequence is complete and N pulses are output, the SYSREF\npattern generator automatically clears Bit 5 and waits for the next\nSYSREF request.In continuous mode, the pattern sequence continues if Bit 5 = 1.\nClear Bit 5 to stop the sequence and wait for the next SYSREF\nrequest.\nPin Control—Level Trigger Mode\nIn level trigger mode (Register 0x0402, Bit 6 = 0), the SYSREF\npattern generator is controlled by the SYSREF_REQ pin. If N-shot\nmode is enabled, force the SYSREF_REQ pin to 1 from 0 to start\nthe SYSREF pattern sequence. After the sequence is complete and\nN pulses are output, force the SYSREF_REQ pin to 0. The pattern\ngenerator then waits for the next SYSREF request.\nIn continuous mode, force the SYSREF_REQ pin to 1 from 0 to\nstart the SYSREF pattern sequence. Force the SYSREF_REQ pin\nto 0 to stop the sequence. The pattern generator then waits for next\nSYSREF request.\nPin Control—Edge Trigger Mode\nIn edge trigger mode, the SYSREF pattern generator is controlled\nby the rising edge or falling edge on the SYSREF_REQ pin. The\nrising or falling active edge is determined by Register 0x0402,\nBits[6:5]. With Bit 6 = 1, Bit 5 controls the active trigger edge. If\nN-shot mode is enabled, the SYSREF_REQ pin active edge starts\nthe SYSREF pattern sequence. After the sequence is complete\nand N pulses are output, the pattern generator waits for the next\nSYSREF request. If SYSREF_REQ is set to 0 before N pulse(s)\nare done, the current pattern sequence is not affected. Therefore,\nif the new SYSREF_REQ active edge arrives before the pattern\nsequence is complete, the new request is missed.\nIn continuous mode, the SYSREF_REQ active edge starts the\nSYSREF pattern sequence. After the sequence, the pattern genera-\ntor waits for the next SYSREF request.\nTable 23.

F | 35 of 67The AD9528  serial control port is a flexible, synchronous seri-\nal communications port that provides a convenient interface to\nmany industry-standard microcontrollers and microprocessors. The\nAD9528  serial control port is compatible with most synchronous\ntransfer formats, including I2C, Motorola SPI, and Intel SSR proto-\ncols. The serial control port allows read/write access to the AD9528\nregister map.\nThe AD9528  uses the Analog Devices unified SPI protocol. The\nunified SPI protocol guarantees that all new Analog Devices prod-\nucts using the unified protocol have consistent serial port charac-\nteristics. The SPI port configuration is programmable via Register\n0x0000. This register is a part of the SPI control logic rather than in\nthe register map and is distinct from the I2C Register 0x0000.\nUnified SPI differs from the SPI port found on older products like the\nAD9523  and AD9524  in the following ways:\n►Unified SPI does not have byte counts. A transfer is terminated\nwhen the CS pin goes high. The W1 and W0 bits in the tradition-\nal SPI become the A12 and A13 bits of the register address. This\nis similar to streaming mode in the traditional SPI.\n►The address ascension bit (Register 0x0000, Bit 2 and Bit 5)\ncontrols whether register addresses are automatically increment-\ned or decremented regardless of the LSB/MSB first setting. In\ntraditional SPI, LSB first dictated auto-increments and MSB first\ndictated autodecrements of the register address.\n►Devices that adhere to the unified serial port have a consistent\nstructure of the first 16 register addresses.\nAlthough the AD9528  supports both the SPI and I2C serial port\nprotocols, only one is active following power-up (as determined by\nthe STATUS0/SP0 and STATUS1/SP1 multifunction pins during the\nstart-up sequence). The only way to change the serial port protocol\nis to reset (or power cycle) the device.\nSPI/I2C PORT SELECTION\nThe AD9528  has two serial interfaces, SPI and I2C. Users can\nselect either the SPI or I2C depending on the states (logic high,\nlogic low) of the two logic level input pins (STATUS0/SP0 and STA-\nTUS1/SP1), when initial power is applied or after a RESET . When\nboth STATUS/SP1 and STATUS0/SP0 are low, the SPI interface is\nactive. Otherwise, I2C is active with two different I2C slave address\nsettings (seven bits wide), as shown in Table 24 . The five most\nsignificant bits (MSBs) of the slave address are hardware coded as\n10101, and the two LSBs are determined by the logic levels of the\nSTATUS1/SP1and STATUS0/SP0 pins.\nTable 24. Serial Port Mode Selection\nSTATUS1/SP1 STATUS0/SP0 Address\nLow Low SPI\nLow High I2C = 1010100\nHigh Low Undefined\nHigh High I2C = 1010101SPI SERIAL PORT OPERATION\nPin Descriptions\nThe SCLK (serial clock) pin serves as the serial shift clock. This pin\nis an input. SCLK synchronizes serial control port read and write\noperations. The rising edge SCLK registers write data bits, and\nthe falling edge registers read data bits. The SCLK pin supports a\nmaximum clock rate of 50 MHz.\nThe SPI port supports both 3-wire (bidirectional) and 4-wire (unidir-\nectional) hardware configurations and both MSB-first and LSB-first\ndata formats. Both the hardware configuration and data format\nfeatures are programmable. The 3-wire mode uses the SDIO (serial\ndata input/output) pin for transferring data in both directions. The\n4-wire mode uses the SDIO pin for transferring data to the AD9528 ,\nand the SDO pin for transferring data from the AD9528 .\nThe CS (chip select) pin is an active low control that gates read\nand write operations. Assertion (active low) of the CS pin initiates\na write or read operation to the AD9528  SPI port. Any number of\ndata bytes can be transferred in a continuous stream. The register\naddress is automatically incremented or decremented based on\nthe setting of the address ascension bits (Register 0x0000, Bit 2\nand Bit 5). CS must be deasserted at the end of the last byte\ntransferred, thereby ending the stream mode. This pin is internally\nconnected to a 35 k Ω pull-up resistor. When CS is high, the SDIO\nand SDO pins go into a high impedance state.\nImplementation Specific Details\nThe following product specific items are defined in the unified SPI\nprotocol:\n►Analog Devices unified SPI protocol Revision: 1.0\n►Chip type: 0x5\n►Clock serial ID: 0x00F\n►Physical layer: 3-and 4-wire supported\n►Optional single-byte instruction mode: not supported\n►Data link not used\n►Control not used\nCommunication Cycle—Instruction Plus Data\nThe unified SPI protocol consists of a two-part communication\ncycle. The first part is a 16-bit instruction word that is coincident\nwith the first 16 SCLK rising edges and a payload. The instruction\nword provides the AD9528  serial control port with information re-\ngarding the payload. The instruction word includes the R/ W bit that\nindicates the direction of the payload transfer (that is, a read or\nwrite operation). The instruction word also indicates the starting\nregister address of the first payload byte.\nData Sheet AD9528\nSERIAL CONTROL PORT\nanalog.com Rev. F | 36 of 67Write\nIf the instruction word indicates a write operation, the payload\nis written into the serial control port buffer of the AD9528 . Data\nbits are registered on the rising edge of SCLK. Generally, it does\nnot matter what data is written to blank registers; however, it is\ncustomary to use 0s. Note that there may be reserved registers with\ndefault values not equal to 0x00; however, every effort was made to\navoid this.\nMost of the serial port registers are buffered and data written\ninto these buffered registers does not take effect immediately. An\nadditional operation is needed to transfer buffered serial control\nport contents to the registers that actually control the device. This\ntransfer is accomplished with an IO_UPDATE operation, which is\nperformed in one of two ways. One method is to write a Logic\n1 to Register 0x000F, Bit 0 (this bit is an autoclearing bit). The\nuser can change as many register bits as desired before executing\nan IO_UPDATE. The IO_UPDATE operation transfers the buffer\nregister contents to their active register counterparts.\nRead\nIf the instruction word indicates a read operation, the next N × 8\nSCLK cycles clock out the data starting from the address specified\nin the instruction word. N is the number of data bytes read. The\nreadback data is driven to the pin on the falling edge and must be\nlatched on the rising edge of SCLK. Blank registers are not skipped\nover during readback.\nA readback operation takes data from either the serial control port\nbuffer registers or the active registers, as determined by Register\n0x0001, Bit 5.\nSPI Instruction Word (16 Bits)\nThe MSB of the 16-bit instruction word is R/ W, which indicates\nwhether the instruction is a read or a write. The next 15 bits are theregister address (A14 to A0), which indicates the starting register\naddress of the read/write operation (see Table 26 ). Note that A14\nand A13 are ignored and treated as zeros in the AD9528  because\nthere are no registers that require more than 13 address bits.\nSPI MSB-/LSB-First Transfers\nThe AD9528  instruction word and payload can be MSB first or LSB\nfirst. The default for the AD9528  is MSB first. The LSB first mode\ncan be set by writing a 1 to Register 0x0000, Bit 1 and Bit 6.\nImmediately after the LSB first bit is set, subsequent serial control\nport operations are LSB first.\nAddress Ascension\nIf the address ascension bits (Register 0x0000, Bit 2 and Bit 5) are\nzero, the serial control port register address decrements from the\nspecified starting address toward Address 0x0000.\nIf the address ascension bits (Register 0x0000, Bit 2 and Bit 5)\nare one, the serial control port register address increments from\nthe starting address toward Address 0x1FFF. Reserved addresses\nare not skipped during multibyte input/output operations; therefore,\nwrite the default value to a reserved register and 0s to unmapped\nregisters. Note that it is more efficient to issue a new write com-\nmand than to write the default value to more than two consecutive\nreserved (or unmapped) registers.\nTable 25.

Serial Control Port Timing\nParameter Description\ntDV SCLK to valid SDIO (see Figure 43 )\nI2C SERIAL PORT OPERATION\nThe I2C interface is popular because it requires only two pins and\neasily supports multiple devices on the same bus. Its main disad-\nvantage is programming speed, which is 400 kbps (maximum).\nThe AD9528  I2C port design uses the I2C fast mode; however, it\nsupports both the 100 kHz standard mode and 400 kHz fast mode.\nThe AD9528  does not strictly adhere to every requirement in the\noriginal I2C specification. In particular, specifications such as slew\nrate limiting and glitch filtering are not implemented. Therefore, the\nAD9528  is I2C compatible, but may not be fully I2C compliant.\nThe AD9528  I2C port consists of a serial data line (SDA) and\na serial clock line (SCL). In an I2C bus system, the AD9528  is\nconnected to the serial bus (data bus SDA and clock bus SCL)\nas a slave device; that is, no clock is generated by the AD9528 .\nThe AD9528  uses direct 16-bit memory addressing instead of more\ncommon 8-bit memory addressing.\nThe AD9528  allows up to two unique slave devices to occupy the\nI2C bus. These are accessed via a 7-bit slave address transmitted\nas part of an I2C packet. Only the device with a matching slave\naddress responds to subsequent I2C commands. Table 24  lists the\nsupported device slave addresses.\nI2C Bus Characteristics\nA summary of the various I2C abbreviations appears in Table 28 .\nTable 28. I2C Bus Abbreviation Definitions\nAbbreviation Definition\nS Start\nSr Repeated start\nP Stop\nA Acknowledge\nA No acknowledge\nW Write\nR Read\nThe transfer of data is shown in Figure 46 . One clock pulse is\ngenerated for each data bit transferred. The data on the SDA line\nmust be stable during the high period of the clock. The high or low\nstate of the data line can change only when the clock signal on the\nSCL line is low.Figure 46. Valid Bit Transfer\nStart/stop functionality is shown in Figure 47 . The start condition\nis characterized by a high to low transition on the SDA line while\nSCL is high. The master always generates the start condition to\ninitialize a data transfer. The stop condition is characterized by a\nlow to high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high. The master\nalways generates the stop condition to terminate a data transfer.\nEvery byte on the SDA line must be eight bits long. Each byte must\nbe followed by an acknowledge bit; bytes are sent MSB first.\nThe acknowledge bit (A) is the ninth bit attached to any 8-bit data\nbyte. An acknowledge bit is always generated by the receiving\ndevice (receiver) to inform the transmitter that the byte has been\nreceived by pulling the SDA line low during the ninth clock pulse\nafter each 8-bit data byte.\nThe no acknowledge bit ( A) is the ninth bit attached to any 8-bit\ndata byte. A no acknowledge bit is always generated by the receiv-\ning device (receiver) to inform the transmitter that the byte has not\nbeen received by leaving the SDA line high during the ninth clock\npulse after each 8-bit data byte. After issuing a no acknowledge bit,\nthe AD9528  I2C state machine goes into an idle state.\nData Transfer Process\nThe master initiates data transfer by asserting a start condition,\nwhich indicates that a data stream follows. All I2C slave devices\nconnected to the serial bus respond to the start condition.\nThe master then sends an 8-bit address byte over the SDA line,\nconsisting of a 7-bit slave address (MSB first) plus an R/ W bit. This\nbit determines the direction of the data transfer, that is, whether\ndata is written to or read from the slave device (0 = write and 1 =\nread).\nThe peripheral whose address corresponds to the transmitted ad-\ndress responds by sending an acknowledge bit. All other devices\non the bus remain idle while the selected device waits for data to be\nread from or written to it. If the R/ W bit is 0, the master (transmitter)\nwrites to the slave device (receiver). If the R/ W bit is 1, the master\n(receiver) reads from the slave device (transmitter).\nThe format for these commands is described in the Data Transfer\nFormat  section.\nData Sheet AD9528\nSERIAL CONTROL PORT\nanalog.com Rev. F | 39 of 67Data is then sent over the serial bus in the format of nine clock\npulses, one data byte (eight bits) from either master (write mode)\nor slave (read mode) followed by an acknowledge bit from the\nreceiving device. The number of bytes that can be transmitted\nper transfer is unrestricted. In write mode, the first two data bytes\nimmediately after the slave address byte are the internal memory\n(control registers) address bytes, with the high address byte first.\nThis addressing scheme gives a memory address of up to 216 − 1\n= 65,535. The data bytes after these two memory address bytes\nare register data written to the control registers. In read mode, the\ndata bytes after the slave address byte are register data written to\nor read from the control registers.\nWhen all the data bytes are read or written, stop conditions are\nestablished. In write mode, the master (transmitter) asserts a stopcondition to end data transfer during the clock pulse following\nthe acknowledge bit for the last data byte from the slave device\n(receiver). In read mode, the master device (receiver) receives the\nlast data byte from the slave device (transmitter) but does not\npull SDA low during the ninth clock pulse. This is known as a no\nacknowledge bit. By receiving the no acknowledge bit, the slave\ndevice knows that the data transfer is finished and enters idle\nmode. The master then pulls the data line low during the low period\nbefore the 10th clock pulse, and high during the 10th clock pulse to\nassert a stop condition.\nA start condition can be used in place of a stop condition. Further-\nmore, a start or stop condition can occur at any time, and partially\ntransferred bytes are discarded.\nFigure 47. Start and Stop Conditions\nFigure 48. Acknowledge Bit\nFigure 49.

F | 45 of 67The AD9528  is a multifunctional, high speed device that targets\na wide variety of clock applications. The numerous innovative\nfeatures contained in the device each consume incremental power.\nIf all outputs are enabled in the maximum frequency and mode that\nhave the highest power, the safe thermal operating conditions of\nthe device may be exceeded. Careful analysis and consideration of\npower dissipation and thermal management are critical elements in\nthe successful application of the AD9528 .\nThe AD9528  is specified to operate within the industrial tempera-\nture range of –40°C to +85°C. This specification is conditional, such\nthat the absolute maximum junction temperature is not exceeded\n(as specified in Table 19 ). At high operating temperatures, extreme\ncare must be taken when operating the device to avoid exceeding\nthe junction temperature and potentially damaging the device.\nMany variables contribute to the operating junction temperature\nwithin the device, including\n►Selected driver mode of operation\n►Output clock speed\n►Supply voltage\n►Ambient temperature\nThe combination of these variables determines the junction temper-\nature within the AD9528  for a given set of operating conditions.\nThe AD9528  is specified for an ambient temperature (TA). To\nensure that TA is not exceeded, use an airflow source.\nUse the following equation to determine the junction temperature on\nthe application PCB:\n     TJ = TCASE + (ΨJT × PD)\nwhere:\nTJ is the junction temperature (°C).\nTCASE is the case temperature (°C) measured at the top center of\nthe package.\nΨJT is the value from Table 20 .\nPD is the power dissipation of the AD9528 .\nValues of θJA are provided for package comparison and PCB de-\nsign considerations. θJA can be used for a first order approximation\nof TJ by the equation\n     TJ = TA + (θJA × PD)\nwhere TA is the ambient temperature (°C).\nValues of θJC are provided for package comparison and PCB\ndesign considerations when an external heat sink is required.\nValues of ΨJB are provided for package comparison and PCB\ndesign considerations.\nCLOCK SPEED AND DRIVER MODE\nClock speed directly and linearly influences the total power dis-\nsipation of the device and, therefore, the junction temperature.Two operating frequencies are listed under the incremental power\ndissipation parameter in Table 3 . Using linear interpretation is a\nsufficient approximation for frequency not listed in the table. When\ncalculating power dissipation for thermal consideration, remove\nthe amount of power dissipated in the 100 Ω resistor. If using\nthe data in Table 3 , this power is already removed. If using the\ncurrent vs. frequency graphs provided in the Typical Performance\nCharacteristics  section, the power into the load must be subtracted,\nusing the following equation:\n     PLOAD = Differential Output Voltage Swing2/100 Ω\nEVALUATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS\nThe first step in evaluating the operating conditions is to determine\nthe maximum power consumption (PD) internal to the AD9528 . The\nmaximum PD excludes power dissipated in the load resistors of\nthe drivers because such power is external to the device. Use the\npower dissipation specifications listed in Table 3  to calculate the\ntotal power dissipated for the desired configuration.\nTable 34  and Table 35  summarize the incremental power dissipa-\ntion from the base power configuration for two different examples.\nTable 34.
