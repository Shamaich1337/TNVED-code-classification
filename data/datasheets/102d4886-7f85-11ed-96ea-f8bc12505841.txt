General description\nThe 74LVC4245A is an octal dual supply translating transceiver featuring 3-state bus compatible\noutputs in both send and receive directions. It is designed to interface between a 3 V and 5 V\nbus in a mixed 3 V and 5 V supply environment. The device features an output enable input ( OE)\nand a send/receive input (DIR) for direction control. A HIGH on OE causes the outputs to assume\na high-impedance OFF-state, effectively isolating the buses. In suspend mode, when either\nsupply is zero, there is no current path between supplies. V CCA ≥ V CCB, except in suspend mode.\nSchmitt-trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant of slower input rise and fall times.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•5 V tolerant inputs/outputs, for interfacing with 5 V logic\n•Wide supply voltage range:\n•3 V bus (V CC(B) ): 1.5 V to 3.6 V\n•5 V bus (V CC(A) ): 1.5 V to 5.5 V\n•CMOS low-power consumption\n•TTL interface capability at 3.3 V\n•Overvoltage tolerant control inputs to 5.5 V\n•High-impedance when V CC(A)  = 0 V\n•Complies with JEDEC standard no. JESD8B/JESD36\n•Latch-up performance meets requirements of JESD78 Class 1\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

#### Description:
The **74LVC4245A** is an **octal dual supply translating transceiver** designed to facilitate communication between devices operating at different voltage levels (3 V and 5 V). It features 3-state bus-compatible outputs that can operate in both send and receive directions. The device includes an output enable input (OE) and a direction control input (DIR), allowing for flexible data transfer between the two voltage domains.

#### Typical Applications:
The 74LVC4245A is commonly used in:
- **Mixed Voltage Systems:** Enabling communication between 3 V and 5 V logic devices.
- **Level Shifting:** Translating signals between different voltage levels in digital circuits.
- **Bus Systems:** Facilitating data transfer in multi-device environments where different voltage levels are present.
- **Microcontroller Interfaces:** Connecting microcontrollers with peripherals that operate at different voltage levels.

This component is particularly useful in applications where power management and signal integrity are critical, such as in consumer electronics, automotive systems, and industrial automation.
