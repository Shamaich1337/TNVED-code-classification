General description\nThe 74AVC8T245 is an 8-bit, dual supply transceiver that enables bidirectional level translation. It\nfeatures two 8-bit input-output ports (An and Bn), a direction control input (DIR), a output enable\ninput ( OE) and dual supply pins (V CC(A)  and V CC(B) ). Both V CC(A)  and V CC(B)  can be supplied at any\nvoltage between 0.8 V and 3.6 V making the device suitable for translating between any of the low\nvoltage nodes (0.8 V, 1.2 V, 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V and 3.3 V). Pins An, OE and DIR are referenced to\nVCC(A)  and pins Bn are referenced to V CC(B) . A HIGH on DIR allows transmission from An to Bn and\na LOW on DIR allows transmission from Bn to An. The output enable input ( OE) can be used to\ndisable the outputs so the buses are effectively isolated.\nThe device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing any damaging backflow current through the device when it is\npowered down. In suspend mode when either V CC(A)  or V CC(B)  are at GND level, both An and Bn\nare in the high-impedance OFF-state.\n2.

#### Description:
The **74AVC8T245** is an 8-bit dual supply translating transceiver designed for bidirectional level translation between different voltage domains. It features two 8-bit input-output ports (An and Bn), a direction control input (DIR), an output enable input (OE), and dual supply pins (VCC(A) and VCC(B)). The device allows for voltage translation between low voltage nodes ranging from 0.8 V to 3.6 V, making it suitable for interfacing between various digital logic levels.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Level Shifting:** Used in applications where devices operate at different voltage levels, such as interfacing 3.3 V logic with 1.8 V or 2.5 V devices.
- **Data Communication:** Ideal for high-speed data communication between microcontrollers, FPGAs, and other digital devices.
- **Power Management:** Can be utilized in power management systems where voltage translation is necessary for efficient operation.
- **Signal Processing:** Employed in signal processing applications where different voltage levels need to be managed effectively.

This component is particularly useful in mixed-voltage environments, ensuring compatibility and reliable communication between devices operating at different voltage levels.
