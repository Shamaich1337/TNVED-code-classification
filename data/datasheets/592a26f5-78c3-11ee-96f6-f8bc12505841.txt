An F-RAM is nonvolatile and\nperforms reads and writes similar to a RAM. It provides reliable\ndata retention for 151 years while eliminating the complexities,\noverhead, and system-level re liability problems caused by\nEEPROM and other nonvo latile memories. \nUnlike EEPROM, the FM24V01A per forms write operations at\nbus speed. No write delays are incurred. Data is written to the\nmemory array immediately af ter each byte is successfully\ntransferred to the device. The next bus cycle can commencewithout the need for data polling. In addition, the product offers\nsubstantial write endurance co mpared with other nonvolatile\nmemories. F-RAM also exhibits much lower power during writes\nthan EEPROM because write operations do not require an\ninternally elevated power supply voltage for write circuits. The\nFM24V01A is capable of supporting 10\n14 read/write cycles, or\n100 million times more write cycles than EEPROM. \nThese capabilities make the FM24V01A ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications, requirin g frequent or rapid writes.\nExamples range from data loggin g, where the number of write\ncycles may be critical, to demanding  industrial controls where the\nlong write time of EEPROM can cause data loss. The\ncombination of features allows more frequent data writing with\nless overhead for the system.\nThe FM24V01A provides substantia l benefits to users of serial\nEEPROM as a hardware drop-in  replacement. The device\nincorporates a read-only Device  ID that allows the host to\ndetermine the manufacturer, product density, and product\nrevision. The device specific ations are guaranteed over an\nindustrial temperature range of –40 \uf0b0C to +85 \uf0b0C.\nFor a complete list of related resources, click here .\nLogic Block Diagram\nAddress \nLatch16 K x 8\nF-RAM Array\nData Latch8\nSDACounter\nSerial to Parallel\nConverter\nControl LogicSCL\nWP\nA0-A2Device ID and \nManufacturer ID814\n8\nNote\n1.The FM24V01A does not meet the NXP I2C specification in the Fast-mode Plus (Fm+, 1 MHz) for IOL and in the High Speed Mode (Hs-mode, 3.4 MHz) for Vhys.

The memory array is\nlogically organized as 16,384 × 8 bits and is accessed using a\ntwo-wire (I2C) interface. The functional operation of the F-RAM\nis similar to serial EEPROM. T he major difference between the\nFM24V01A and a serial EEPROM with the same pinout is the\nF-RAM\'s superior write performance, high endurance, and low\npower consumption. \nMemory Architecture\nWhen accessing the FM24V01A, the user addresses 16K\nlocations of eight data bits each. These eight data bits are shifted\nin or out serially. The addresses are accessed using the two-wire\nprotocol, which includes a slave address (to distinguish othernon-memory devices) and a two-byte address. The upper 2 bits\nof the address range are \'don\'t care\' values. The complete\naddress of 14 bits specifies each byte address uniquely. \nThe access time for the memory operation is essentially zero,\nbeyond the time needed for the serial protocol. That is, the\nmemory is read or written at th e speed of the two-wire bus. Unlike\na serial EEPROM, it is not nece ssary to poll the device for a\nready condition because writes occur at bus speed. By the time\na new bus transaction can be shifted into the device, a write\noperation is complete. This is explained in more detail in theMemory Operation on page 6 . Two-wire Interface\nThe FM24V01A employs a bidire ctional two-wire bus protocol\nusing few pins or board space. Figure 2  illustrates a typical\nsystem configuration using the FM24V01A in a microcon-\ntroller-based system. The two-wire bus is familiar to many users\nbut is described in this section. \nBy convention, any device that is sending data to the bus is the\ntransmitter while the target device for this data is the receiver.\nThe device that is controlling th e bus is the master. The master\nis responsible for generating the clock signal for all operations.Any device on the bus that is being controlled is a slave. The\nFM24V01A is always a slave device. \nThe bus protocol is controlled by transition states in the SDA and\nSCL signals. There are four conditions including START, STOP,\ndata bit, or acknowledge. Figure 3  and Figure 4 on page 5  illus-\ntrate the signal conditions that specify the four states. Detailed\ntiming diagrams are shown in the electrical specifications\nsection. \nThe FM24V01A does not meet the NXP I2C specification in the\nFast-mode Plus (Fm+, 1 MHz) for IOL and in the High Speed\nMode (Hs-mode, 3.4 MHz) for Vhys. Refer to the DC Electrical\nCharacteristics  table for more details.\nSTOP Condition (P)\nA STOP condition is indicated when the bus master drives SDA\nfrom LOW to HIGH while the SCL signal is HIGH. All operations\nusing the FM24V01A should end with a STOP condition. If an\noperation is in progress when a ST OP is asserted, the operation\nwill be aborted. The master must have control of the SDA (not a\nmemory read) to assert a STOP condition. START Condition (S)\nA START condition is indicated when the bus master drives SDA\nfrom HIGH to LOW while the SC L signal is HIGH. All commands\nshould be preceded by a START condition. An operation inprogress can be aborted by asserting a START condition at any\ntime. Aborting an operation using the START condition will ready\nthe FM24V01A for a new operation. Figure 2.

Except under the three conditions described\nabove, the SDA signal should not change while SCL is HIGH.\nAcknowledge / No-acknowledge\nThe acknowledge takes place after the 8th data bit has beentransferred in any transaction. During this state, the transmittershould release the SDA bus to allow the receiver to drive it. The\nreceiver drives the SDA signal LOW to acknowledge receipt of\nthe byte. If the receiver does no t drive SDA LOW, the condition\nis a no-acknowledge and the operation is aborted.The receiver will fail to acknowledge for two distinct reasons, the\nfirst being that a byte transf er fails. In this case, the\nno-acknowledge ceases the current operation so that the part\ncan be addressed again. This allows the last byte to berecovered in the event of a communication error. \nThe second and most common reason is that, the receiver does\nnot acknowledge to deliberately end an operation. For example,during a read operation, the FM 24V01A will continue to place\ndata on the bus as long as the receiver sends acknowledges\n(and clocks). When a read operation is complete and no moredata is needed, the receiver mu st not acknowledge the last byte.\nIf the receiver acknowledges the last byte, this causes the\nFM24V01A to attempt to drive the bus on the next clock while themaster is sending a new command such as STOP.Figure 3.

A master code (00001XXXb) must be issued to place the device into the \nhigh-speed mode. Communication between master and slave will then  be enabled for speeds up to 3.4 MHz. A STOP condition will \nexit Hs-mode. Single- and multiple-b yte reads and writ es are supported. \nSlave Device Address\nThe first byte that the FM24V01A expects after a START\ncondition is the slave address. As shown in Figure 7 , the slave\naddress contains the device type or slave ID, the device select\naddress bits, and a bit that specif ies if the transaction is a read\nor a write. \nBits 7-4 are the device type (slave ID) and should be set to 1010b\nfor the FM24V01A. These bits allow other function types to\nreside on the two-wire bus within an identical address range. Bits3-1 are the device select addr ess bits. They must match the\ncorresponding value on the external address pins to select the\ndevice. Up to eight FM24V01A devices can reside on the sametwo-wire bus by assigning a different address to each. Bit 0 is the\nread/write bit (R/W\n). R/W  = ‘1’ indicates a read operation and\nR/W = ‘0’ indicates a write operation. \nAddressing Overview\nAfter the FM24V01A (as receiver) acknowledges the slaveaddress, the master can plac e the memory address on the bus\nfor a write operation. The address requires two bytes. The\ncomplete 14-bit address is latched internally. Each access\ncauses the latched address value to be incremented automati-cally. The current address is the value that is held in the latch;\neither a newly written value or the address following the last\naccess. The current address will be held for as long as powerremains or until a new value is written. Reads always use the\ncurrent address. A random read address can be loaded by\nbeginning a write operation as explained below. \nAfter transmission of each data byte, just prior to the\nacknowledge, the FM24V01A increments the internal addresslatch. This allows the next sequential byte to be accessed with\nno additional addressing. After the last address (3FFFh) is\nreached, the address latch will roll over to 0000h. There is nolimit to the number of bytes that can be accessed with a single\nread or write operation. \nData Transfer\nAfter the address bytes have been transmitted, data transferbetween the bus master and the FM24V01A can begin. For a\nread operation the FM24V01A will place 8 data bits on the bus\nthen wait for an acknowledge from the master. If theacknowledge occurs, the FM24V01A will transfer the nextsequential byte. If the acknowledge is not sent, the FM24V01A\nwill end the read operation. For a write operation, the FM24V01A\nwill accept 8 data bits from the master then sends anacknowledge. All data transfer occurs MSB (most significant bit)\nfirst. \nMemory Operation\nThe FM24V01A is designed to operate in a manner very similar\nto other two-wire interface memory products. The major differ-ences result from the higher performance write capability of\nF-RAM technology. These improvements result in some differ-\nences between the FM24V01A and a similar configurationEEPROM during writes. The comp lete operation for both writes\nand reads is explained in the following sections. \nWrite Operation\nAll writes begin with a slave address, then a memory address.\nThe bus master indicates a write operation by setting the LSB ofthe slave address (R/W\n bit) to a \'0\'. After addressing, the bus\nmaster sends each byte of data to the memory and the memory\ngenerates an acknowledge condit ion. Any number of sequential\nbytes may be written. If the end of the address range is reached\ninternally, the address counter will wrap from 3FFFh to 0000h.\nUnlike other nonvolatile memory  technologies, there is no\neffective write delay with F-RAM. Since the read and write\naccess times of the underlying memory are the same, the userexperiences no delay through th e bus. The entire memory cycle\noccurs in less time than a single bus clock. Therefore, any\noperation including read or writ e can occur immediately following\na write. Acknowledge polling, a technique used with EEPROMs\nto determine if a write is complete is unnecessary and will always\nreturn a ready condition.Figure 6.

It will be complete before the acknowledge is sent.\nTherefore, if the user desires to  abort a write without altering the\nmemory contents, this should be done using START or STOP\ncondition prior to the 8th data bi t. The FM24V01A uses no page\nbuffering. The memory array can be writ e-protected using the WP pin.\nSetting the WP pin to a HIGH condition (VDD) will write-protect\nall addresses. The FM24V01A will not acknowledge data bytesthat are written to protected addresses. In addition, the address\ncounter will not increment if wr ites are attempted to these\naddresses. Setting WP to a LOW state (V\nSS) will disable the write\nprotect. WP is pulled down internally. \nFigure 8  and Figure 9  illustrate a single-byte and multiple-byte\nwrite cycles in Fast -mode Plus (Fm+). Figure 10  illustrates a\nsingle-byte write cycles in Hs mode\nRead Operation\nThere are two basic types of read operations. They are currentaddress read and selective address read. In a current addressread, the FM24V01A uses the internal address latch to supply\nthe address. In a selective read,  the user performs a procedure\nto set the address to  a specific value. \nCurrent Address & Sequential Read\nAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, the FM24V01A uses an\ninternal latch to supply the address for a read operation. A\ncurrent address read uses the existing value in the address latch\nas a starting place for the read  operation. The system reads from\nthe address immediately following that of the last operation. To perform a current address read, the bus master supplies a\nslave address with the LSB set to a \'1\'. This indicates that a readoperation is requested. After receiving the complete slave\naddress, the FM24V01A will begin shifting out data from the\ncurrent address on the next clock. The current address is thevalue held in the internal address latch. \nBeginning with the current address, the bus master can read any\nnumber of bytes. Thus, a sequential read is simply a current\naddress read with multiple byte transfers. After each byte the\ninternal address counter will be incremented. \nNote  Each time the bus master acknowledges a byte, this\nindicates that the FM24V01A shoul d read out the next sequential\nbyte.

The four valid methods are:\n1. The bus master issues a no-acknowledge in the 9th clock \ncycle and a STOP in the 10th clo ck cycle. This is illustrated in \nthe following diagrams. This method is preferred. 2. The bus master issues a no-acknowledge in the 9th clock \ncycle and a START in the 10th. \n3. The bus master issues a STOP in the 9th clock cycle.4. The bus master issues a START in the 9th clock cycle. \nIf the internal address reache s 3FFFh, it will wrap around to\n0000h on the next read cycle. Figure 11  and Figure 12  show the\nproper operation for current address reads.\nFigure 11.  Current Address Read \nFigure 12.  Sequential Read \nFigure 13.

This\ninvolves using the first three bytes of a write operation to set the\ninternal address followed by  subsequent read operations. To perform a selective read, the bus master sends out the slave\naddress with the LSB (R/W ) set to 0. This specifies a write\noperation. According to the writ e protocol, the bus master then\nsends the address bytes that are loaded into the internal address\nlatch. After the FM24V01A acknowledges the address, the bus\nmaster issues a START condition. This simultaneously abortsthe write operation and allows the read command to be issued\nwith the slave address LSB set to a \'1\'. The operation is now a\ncurrent address read.\nSleep Mode\nA low-power mode called Sleep Mode is implemented on the\nFM24V01A device. The device will enter this low power statewhen the Sleep command 86h is clocked-in. Sleep Mode entrycan be entered as follows:\n1. The master sends a START command.\n2. The master sends Reserved Slave ID 0xF8.3. The FM24V01A sends an ACK.\n4. The master sends the I\n2C-bus slave address of the slave \ndevice it needs to identify. The last bit is a \'Don\'t care\' value (R/W\n bit). Only one device must acknowledge this byte (the \none that has the I2C-bus slave address).\n5. The FM24V01A sends an ACK.6. The master sends a Re-START command.\n7. The master sends Reserved Slave ID 0x86.8. The FM24V01A sends an ACK.9. The master sends STOP to ensure the device enters sleep \nmode.\nOnce in sleep mode, the device draws I\nZZ current, but the device\ncontinues to monitor the I2C pins. Once the master sends a\nSlave Address that the FM24V01A identifies, it will "wakeup" andbe ready for normal operation within t\nREC (400 \uf06ds max.). As an\nalternative method of determining when the device is ready, the\nmaster can send read or write commands and look for an ACK.While the device is waking up, it  will NACK the master until it is\nready.Figure 14.
