In addition to  providing \npower -on reset signals, an on -chip watchdog timer can reset the \nmicroprocessor if it fails to strobe within a preset timeout \nperiod. A reset signal ca n also be asserted by  an external push -\nbutton, through a manual reset input. The three parts feature different combinations of watchdog input, manual reset input, and output stage configuration, as shown in Table 1. These  parts are  available in a choice of seven reset threshold \noptions ranging from 2. 19 V to 4.63 V . The reset and watchdog \ntimeout periods are fixed at  140 ms (min imum ) and 1.6  sec \n(typical), respectively.  \nThe ADM823/ADM824/ADM825 are available in 5- lead SC70  \nand SOT -23 packages and typically consume only 5  µA, making \nthem suitable for use in low power , portable applications . \n \nTable 1.

D | Page 9  of 12 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\nThe ADM823/ADM824/ADM825 provide microprocessor \nsupply voltage supervision by controlling the reset input  of the \nmicroprocessor . Code execution errors are avoided during \npower -up, power -down, and brownout conditions by assert ing a \nreset signal w hen the supply voltage is below a preset threshold. \nErrors are also avoided by allowing supply voltage stabilization \nwith a fixed  timeout reset pulse after the supply voltage rises \nabove the threshold.  In addition, problems with micropr ocessor \ncode execution can be monitored and corrected with a watch dog \ntimer (ADM823/ ADM824). By including watchdog strobe \ninstructions in microprocessor code, a watchdog timer can detect whether  the microprocessor code breaks down or becomes \nstuck in an in finite loop. If this happens, the watchdog timer \nasserts a reset pulse that restarts the microprocessor in a known \nstate. If the user detects a problem with the system’s operation, a \nmanual reset input is available (ADM823/ADM825) to  reset the \nmicroprocess or with an external push -button, for example.  \nRESET OUTPUT  \nThe ADM823 features an active  low, push -pull reset output , and \nthe ADM 824/ADM825 feature dual active  low and active  high \npush -pull reset outputs. For active l ow and active  high outputs, \nthe reset s ignal is guaranteed to be logic low and logic high , \nrespectively , for V CC ≥ 1  V. \nThe reset output is asserted when V CC is below the reset \nthreshold (V TH), when MR is driven low , or when WDI is not \nserviced within the watchdog timeout peri od (t WD). Reset \nremains asserted for the duration of the reset active timeout \nperiod (t RP) after V CC rises  above the reset threshold, after MR \ntransitions  from low  to high, or after the watchdog timer times  \nout. Figure 15 illustrates the behavior of the reset outputs.  \nVCC\n1V\nVCC\n0V\nVCC\n0VVTH VTH\n0VVCC\nRESETRESET tRD\ntRD1VtRP\ntRP\n04534-018 \nFigure 15. Reset Timing Diagram  MANUAL RESET INPUT \nThe ADM823/ADM825 feature a manual reset input ( MR) \nwhich, when driven low, asserts the reset output.  When MR \ntransitions from low to high, reset remains asserted for the \nduration of the reset active timeout period before deasserting. \nThe MR input has a 52 kΩ  internal pull -up so that the input is \nalways high when unconnected. An external push -button \nswitch can be connected between MR and ground so that the \nuser can generate a reset. Debounce circuitry fo r this purpose is \nintegrated on  chip. Noise immunity is provided on the MR \ninput an d fast, negative -going transients of up to 100 ns (typ ical) \nare ignored. A 0.1 µF capacitor between MR and ground \nprovides additional noise immunity.  \nWATCHDOG INPUT  \nThe ADM823/ADM824 feature a watchdog timer that  monitors \nmicroprocessor a ctivity. A timer circuit is cleared with every \nlow-to-high or high- to-low logic transition on the watch dog \ninput pin (WDI), which detects pulses as short as 50 ns. If the \ntimer counts through the preset watchdog timeout period (t WD), \nreset is asserted. Th e microprocessor is required to toggle the \nWDI pin to avoid being reset. Failure of the microprocessor to toggle WDI within the timeout period , therefore , indicates a \ncode execution error, and the reset pulse generated restarts the microprocessor in a know n state.  \nIn addition to logic transitions on WDI, the watchdog timer is also cleared by a reset assertion due to an undervoltage condi -\ntion on V\nCC or by MR being pulled low. When reset is asserted, \nthe watchdog timer is cleared and does not begin counting again \nuntil reset is deas serted . The watchdog timer can be disabled by \nleaving WDI floating or by three -stating the WDI driver.  \nVCC\n1V\nVCC\n0V\nVCC\n0VVTH\n0VVCC\nWDIRESET tRP tRP tWD\n04534-021 \nFigure 16. Watchdog  Timing Diagram\n \nADM823/ADM824/ADM825  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 10 of 12 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nWATCHDOG INPUT CURRE NT \nTo minimize the watchdog input current (and minimize overall \npower consumption), leave WDI low for the majority of the \nwatchdog timeout period. When driven high, WDI can draw as \nmuch as 160 µA. Pulsing WDI low -high- low at a low duty cycle \nreduces the ef fect of the large input current. When WDI is \nunconnected, a window comparator disconnects the watchdog timer from the reset output circuitry so that reset is not asserted when the watchdog timer times out.  \nNEGATIVE -GOING V CC TRANSIENTS  \nTo avoid unnecessary  resets caused by fast power supply \ntransients, the ADM823/ADM824/ADM825 are equipped with glitch rejection circuitry. The typical performance characteristic in Figure 12 plots V\nCC transient duration vs. the transient mag -\nnitude. T he curves show combinations of transient magnitude \nand duration for which a reset is not generated for 4.63 V and \n2.93 V reset threshold parts. For example, with the 2.93 V \nthreshold, a transient that goes 100 mV below the threshold and lasts 8 µs typically does not cause a reset, but if the transient is any larger in magnitude or duration, a reset is generated. An \noptional 0.1 µF bypass capacitor mounted close to V\nCC provides \nadditional glitch rejection.  \nENSURING RESET VALID  TO V CC = 0 V  \nBoth active  low an d active  high reset outputs are guaranteed to \nbe valid for V CC as low as 1 V . However, by using an external \nresistor with push -pull configured reset outputs, valid outputs \nfor V CC as low as 0 V are possible. For an active  low reset output, \na resistor conne cted between RESET  and ground pulls the output \nlow when it is unable to sink current. For an  active  high reset \noutput , a resistor connected between RESET and V CC pulls the \noutput high when it is unable to source current. A large resist -\nance such as 100 k Ω should be used so that the reset output is \nnot overload ed when V CC is above 1 V .  \nADM823/\nADM824/\nADM825VCC\nRESET\n100kΩADM824/\nADM825VCC\nRESET100kΩ\n04534-017 \nFigure 17. Ensuring Reset Valid to V CC = 0 V  WATCHDOG SOFTWARE CO NSIDERATIONS  \nIn implementing the microprocessor watchdog strobe code, quickly s witching WDI low -to-high and then high- to-low \n(minimizing WDI high time) is desirable for current consumption reasons. However, a more effective way of using the watchdog function can be considered.  \nA low -high- low WDI pulse within a given subroutine preven ts \nthe watchdog timing out. However, if the subroutine becomes \nstuck in an infinite loop, the watchdog cannot detect this cond -\nition because the subroutine continues to toggle WDI. A more \neffective coding scheme for detecting this error involves using a \nslightly longer watchdog timeout. In the program that calls the subroutine, WDI is set high (see Figure 18). The subroutine sets \nWDI low when it is called. If the program executes without error, WDI is toggled high and low with ever y loop of the program.  \nIf the subroutine enters an infinite loop, WDI is kept low, the watchdog times out, and the microprocessor is reset.  \n \nSTART\nSET WDI\nHIGH\nPROGRAM\nCODE\nSUBROUTINE\nSET WDI\nLOW\nRETURNINFINITE LOOP:\nWATCHDOG\nTIMES OUTRESET\n04534-020 \nFigure 18.
