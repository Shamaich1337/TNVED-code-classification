The part has been speciﬁ  cally designed to drive 12-, 14- and \n16-bit ADCs with low noise and low distortion, but can also be used as a general-purpose broadband gain block.\nThe LTC6401-20 is easy to use, with minimal support \ncircuitry required. The output common mode voltage is set using an external pin, independent of the inputs, which eliminates the need for transformers or AC-coupling ca-pacitors in many applications. The gain is internally ﬁ  xed at 20dB (10V/V).\nThe LTC6401-20 saves space and power compared to \nalternative solutions using IF gain blocks and transform-ers. The LTC6401-20 is packaged in a compact 16-lead 3mm × 3mm QFN package and operates over the –40°C \nto 85°C temperature range.■ 1.3GHz –3dB Bandwidth\n■ Fixed Gain of 10V/V (20dB)\n■ –93dBc IMD 3 at 70MHz (Equivalent OIP 3 = 50.5dBm)\n■ –74dBc IMD 3 at 140MHz (Equivalent OIP 3 = 41dBm)\n■ 1nV/√⎯H⎯z Internal Op Amp Noise\n■ 2.1nV/√⎯H⎯z Total Input Noise\n■ 6.2dB Noise Figure\n■ Differential Inputs and Outputs\n■ 200Ω Input Impedance\n■ 2.85V to 3.5V Supply Voltage\n■ 50mA Supply Current (150mW)\n■ 1V to 1.6V Output Common Mode Voltage, \nAdjustable\n■ DC- or AC-Coupled Operation\n■ Max Differential Output Swing 4.4V P-P\n■ Small 16-Lead 3mm × 3mm × 0.75mm QFN Package\n■ Differential ADC Driver\n■ Differential Driver/Receiver\n■ Single Ended to Differential Conversion\n■ IF Sampling Receivers\n■ SAW Filter Interfacing, LT, LTC and LTM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation. \nAll other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\n29Ω66.5Ω0.1μF\n0.1μF\n640120 TA01aLTC6401-20VOCM\nENABLELTC220810Ω0.1μF + 1000pF\nINPUT0.1μF\nLTC2208 130Msps\n16-Bit ADC1.25V\n3.3V\n10ΩAIN+\nAIN–VCM VDD\n20dB GAINV+\n–IN+IN3.3V\n+OUT\n+OUTF\n–OUTF\n–OUT\nV–Single-Ended to Differential ADC Driver Equivalent Output IP3 vs Frequency\nFREQUENCY (MHz)0OUTPUT IP3 (dBm)70(NOTE 7)\n60\n504030\n20\n10\n0\n100 50 150\n640120 TA01b200\nLTC6401-20\n2640120fABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nSupply Voltage (V+ – V–) ..........................................3.6V\nInput Current (Note 2) ..........................................±10mA\nOperating Temperature Range \n(Note 3) ............................................... –40°C to 85°C\nSpeciﬁ  ed Temperature Range \n(Note 4) ............................................... –40°C to 85°C\nStorage Temperature Range ................... –65°C to 150°CMaximum Junction Temperature........................... 150°C(Note 1)\n16151413\n5678TOP VIEW\nUD PACKAGE\n16-LEAD (3mm × 3mm) PLASTIC QFN91011\n1712\n4321 V+\nVOCM\nV+\nV–V–\nENABLE\nV+\nV––IN\n–IN+IN+IN–OUT\n–OUTF+OUTF\n+OUT\nTJMAX = 150°C, θ JA = 68°C/W, θ JC = 4.2°C/W\nEXPOSED PAD (PIN 17) IS V–, MUST BE SOLDERED TO PCB\nORDER INFORMATION\nLTC6400 AND LTC6401 SELECTOR GUIDE\nPART NUMBER GAIN\n(dB)GAIN\n(V/V)ZIN (DIFFERENTIAL)\n(Ω)ICC\n(mA)\nLTC6400-20 20 10 200 90\nLTC6401-20 20 10 200 50\nIn addition to the LTC6401 family of ampliﬁ  ers, a lower distortion LTC6400 family is available.

If the inputs go beyond either supply rail, the input current should be limited to less than 10mA.\nNote 3:  The LTC6401C and LTC6401I are guaranteed functional over the \noperating temperature range of –40°C to 85°C.\nNote 4:  The LTC6401C is guaranteed to meet speciﬁ  ed performance from \n0°C to 70°C. It is designed, characterized and expected to meet speciﬁ  ed performance from –40°C to 85°C but is not tested or QA sampled at these temperatures.

Therefore, typical output power is very small.

Differential gain and input impedance are set by 100 Ω/1000Ω resistors in the feedback network. \nSmall output resistors of 12.5 Ω improve the circuit stability \nover various load conditions. They also provide a possible external ﬁ  ltering option, which is often desirable when the \nload is an ADC.\nFilter resistors of 50 Ω are available for additional ﬁ  ltering. \nLowpass/bandpass ﬁ  lters are easily implemented with just \na couple of external components. Moreover, they offer single-ended 50 Ω matching in wideband applications and \nno external resistor is needed.\nThe LTC6401-20 is very ﬂ  exible in terms of I/O coupling. \nIt can be AC- or DC-coupled at the inputs, the outputs or both. Due to the internal connection between input and output, users are advised to keep input common mode voltage between 1V and 1.6V for proper operation. If the inputs are AC-coupled, the input common mode voltage is automatically biased close to V\nOCM and thus no external \ncircuitry is needed for bias. The LTC6401-20 provides an output common mode voltage set by V\nOCM, which allows \ndriving an ADC directly without external components such as a transformer or AC coupling capacitors. The input signal can be either single-ended or differential with only minor differences in distortion performance.\nInput Impedance and Matching\nThe differential input impedance of the LTC6401-20 is \n200Ω. If a 200Ω source impedance is unavailable, then the differential inputs may need to be terminated to a lower \nvalue impedance, e.g. 50 Ω, in order to provide an imped-\nance match to the source. Several choices are available. One approach is to use a differential shunt resistor (Figure 1). Another approach is to employ a wideband transformer (Figure 2). Both methods provide a wideband match. The termination resistor or the transformer must be placed close to the input pins in order to minimize the reﬂ  ection \ndue to input mismatch. Alternatively, one could apply a narrowband impedance match at the inputs of the LTC6401-20 for frequency selection and/or noise reduction.\nReferring to Figure 3, LTC6401-20 can be easily conﬁ  gured \nfor single-ended input and differential output without a balun. The signal is fed to one of the inputs through a matching network while the other input is connected to the same matching network and a source resistor. Because the return ratios of the two feedback paths are equal, the \nFigure 1. Input Termination for Differential 50 Ω Input Impedance \nUsing Shunt Resistor\nFigure 2.

In general, the single-ended input impedance and termination resistor R\nT are determined by the combination \nof R S, RG and R F. For example, when R S is 50Ω, it is found \nthat the single-ended input impedance is 200 Ω and R T is \n66.5Ω in order to match to a 50 Ω source impedance.\nThe LTC6401-20 is unconditionally stable. However, the \noverall differential gain is affected by both source imped-ance and load impedance as shown in Figure 4:\n AV\nVRR\nRVOUT\nIN SL\nL==++2000\n200 25•\nThe noise performance of the LTC6401-20 also depends \nupon the source impedance and termination. For example, an input 1:4 balun transformer in Figure 2 improves SNR by adding 6dB of gain at the inputs. A trade-off between gain and noise is obvious when constant noise ﬁ  gure \ncircle and constant gain circle are plotted within the same \nFigure 4. Calculate Differential Gaininput Smith Chart, based on which users can choose the optimal source impedance for a given gain and noise requirement.\nOutput Match and Filter\nThe LTC6401-20 can drive an ADC directly without \nexternal output impedance matching. Alternatively, the differential output impedance of 25 Ω can be matched to \nhigher value impedance, e.g. 50 Ω, by series resistors or \nan LC network.\nThe internal low pass ﬁ  lter outputs at +OUTF/–OUTF \nhave a –3dB bandwidth of 590MHz. External capacitor can reduce the low pass ﬁ  lter bandwidth as shown in \nFigure 5. A bandpass ﬁ  lter is easily implemented with \nonly a few components as shown in Figure 6. Three 39pF capacitors and a 16nH inductor create a bandpass ﬁ  lter with 165MHz center frequency, –3dB frequencies at 138MHz and 200MHz.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 3.

The \noutput common mode voltage is capable of tracking V OCM \nin a range from 1V to 1.6V. Bandwidth of V OCM control is \ntypically 15MHz, which is dominated by a low pass ﬁ  lter \nconnected to the V OCM pin and is aimed to reduce com-\nmon mode noise generation at the outputs. The internal common mode feedback loop has a –3dB bandwidth around 300MHz, allowing fast common mode rejection at the outputs of the LTC6401-20. The V\nOCM pin should be \ntied to a DC bias voltage where a 0.1μF bypass capacitor is recommended. When interfacing with A/D converters such as the LT22xx families, the V\nOCM can be normally \nconnected to the V CM pin of the ADC.\nDriving A/D Converters\nThe LTC6401-20 has been speciﬁ  cally designed to inter-\nface directly with high speed A/D converters. In Figure 7, an example schematic shows the LTC6401-20 with a single-ended input driving the LTC2208, which is a 16-bit, 130Msps ADC. Two external 10 Ω resistors help eliminate \npotential resonance associated with stray capacitance of PCB traces and bond wire inductance of either the ADC input or the driver output. V\nOCM of the LTC6401-20 is \nconnected to V CM of the LTC2208 at 1.25V. Alternatively, \na single-ended input signal can be converted to differential signal via a balun and fed to the input of the LTC6401-20. The balun also converts input impedance to match 50 Ω \nsource impedance.Figure 7.

Test Circuit A is DC987B, a two-port demonstration circuit for the LTC6401 family. The schematic and silkscreen are shown below. This circuit includes input and output transformers (baluns) for single-ended-to-differential conversion and imped-ance transformation, allowing direct hook-up to a 2-port network analyzer. There are also series resistors at the output to present the LTC6401 with a 375 Ω differential \nload, optimizing distortion performance. Due to the input and output transformers, the –3dB bandwidth is reduced from 1.3GHz to approximately 1.1GHz.\nTest Circuit B uses a 4-port network analyzer to measure \nS-parameters and gain/phase response. This removes the effects of the wideband baluns and associated circuitry, for a true picture of the >1GHz S-parameters and AC characteristics.\nLTC6401-20\n13640120fAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nTop Silkscreen\nLTC6401-20\n14640120fVERSION IC R3 R4 T1 SL1 SL2 SL3\n-G LTC6401CUD-20 OPEN OPEN MINI-CIRCUITS TCM4-19 (1:4) 6dB 20dB 14dB•\n•T1\n(2) •\n•••T3\nTCM 4-19\n1:4T4\nTCM 4-19\n1:4•\n•\n640120 TA03R10\n86.6Ω\nR8\n(1)\nR7\n(1)\nR9\n86.6ΩC3\n0.1μFC4\n0.1μF\nC1\n0.1μFC2\n0.1μF\nLTC6401-20\nVOCM V+V+V–V–V+VCC\nVCC\nV–ENABLE\n+IN+IN\n–IN\n–IN –OUT+OUTF\n–OUTF+OUTENABLE DIS\n12 11 10 9\n12345678\n16151413SL1\n(2)SL2\n(2)\nJ2\n–INJ1\n+IN\nJ5\n–OUTSL3\n(2)J4\n+OUT\nC220.1μFC21\n0.1μFC18\n0.1μF\nC13\n0.1μFC17\n1000pFR16\n0Ω\nTP2\nVCC\n2.85V TO 3.5V 13\n2JP1\nVCC VCC\nVCCC12\n1000pFC9\n1000pFC10\n0.1μF\nC15\n1μFVCC\nC14\n4.7μFC7\n0.1μFR4\n(2)1\n323\n125\n44\n5\nTP5\nVOCMR2(1)\nR10ΩR3\n(2)\nJ6\nTEST IN C19\n0.1μF1\n325\n4C20\n0.1μFR21\n(1)R22(1)R201kR191.5kR14\n(1)\nR13\n0Ω\nC6\n0.1μFC5\n0.1μF\nC24\n0.1μFC23\n0.1μFJ7\nTEST OUT\nNOTE: UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.\n(1) DO NOT STUFF.\n(2)\nSL = SIGNAL LEVEL3\n124\n5\nTP3\nGND R17\n0Ω\nR25\n0ΩR18\n0Ω\nR26\n0Ω R12\n0Ω\nR11\n(1)R24\n(1)R6\n0Ω\nR5\n(1)0dBT2\nTCM 4-19\n1:4TYPICAL APPLICATION\nDemo Circuit 987B Schematic (Test Circuit A)\nLTC6401-20\n15640120f\nInformation furnished by Linear Technology Corporation is believed to be accurate and reliable. \nHowever, no responsibility is assumed for its use.
