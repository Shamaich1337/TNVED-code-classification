All manufacturers of  semiconductor products are exp eriencing counterfeiting of \ntheir parts. Customers who inadvertently purchase counterfeit parts experience many problems such as loss of brand reputation, substandard performance, \nfailed applications, and increased cost of production and manufact uring delays. Fairchild is taking strong measures to protect ourselves and our customers \nfrom the proliferation of counterfeit parts. Fairchild strongly encourages customers to purchase Fairchild parts either directl y from Fairchild or from Authorized \nFairchild Distributors who are listed by country on our web page ci ted above. Products customers buy either from Fairchild dire ctly or from Authorized Fairchild \nDistributors are genuine parts, have full traceability, meet Fairchild’s quality standards for handling and storage and provide  access to Fairchild’s full range of \nup-to-date technical and product information. Fairchild and our  Authorized Distributors will stand behind all warranties and wi ll appropriately address and \nwarranty issues that may arise.  Fairchild will not provide any warranty coverage or other assistance for parts bought from Unau thorized Sources. Fairchild is \ncommitted to combat this global problem and encourage our customers to do their part in stopping this practice by buying direct  or from authorized distributors.\n2.4©200 0 Fairc hild Semiconductor Corporation \nFQP3P50  Rev. \nwww. onsemi.com\n1ON Semiconductor and      are trademarks of Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC dba ON Semiconductor or its subsidiaries i n the United States and/or other countries.\nON Semiconductor owns the rights to a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property .
