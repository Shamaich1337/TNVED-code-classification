Functional diagram\nThe TL431 family comprises a range of 3-terminal adjustable shunt regulators, with specified\nthermal stability over applicable automotive and commercial temperature ranges. The output\nvoltage can be set to any value between V ref (approximately 2.5 V) and 36 V with two external\nresistors (see Figure 8 ). These devices have a typical output impedance of 0.2 Ω. Active output\ncircuitry provides a very sharp turn-on characteristic, making these devices excellent replacements\nfor Zener diodes in many applications like on-board regulation, adjustable power supplies and\nswitching power supplies.\nVref\nANODECATHODE\nREF\n006aab569\nFig. 1.

#### Description:
The TL431AIDBZR is a three-terminal adjustable precision shunt regulator. It allows for the output voltage to be set between approximately 2.495 V and 36 V using two external resistors. This component is designed to provide a stable reference voltage and is often used as a replacement for Zener diodes in various applications due to its sharp turn-on characteristics and thermal stability.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Shunt Regulation:** Used to maintain a constant voltage across a load.
- **Precision Current Limiter:** Controls the current flowing through a circuit to prevent damage.
- **Constant Current Sink:** Provides a stable current output for driving loads.
- **Isolated Feedback Loop for Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS):** Used in power supply circuits to regulate output voltage.
- **Automotive Applications:** Suitable for use in automotive electronics due to its AEC-Q100 qualification.

This component is particularly useful in applications requiring precise voltage regulation and current control, making it ideal for power management systems in both consumer and automotive electronics.
