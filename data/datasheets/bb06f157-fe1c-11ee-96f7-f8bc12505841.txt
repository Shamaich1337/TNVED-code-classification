Output load requirement  \nTo ensure this module can operate efficiently and reliably, the minimum output load may not be less than 10% of the full load during \noperation. If the actual output power is low, connect a resistor at the output end in parallel to increase the load.  \n2. Overload Protection  \nUnder normal operating conditions, the output circuit of this product has no protection against overload. The simplest method to add \nthis is to add a circuit breaker to the circuit.  \n3. Recommended circuit  \nIf you want to further decrease the input/output ripple, you can increase the capacitance accordingly or choose capacitors with low \nESR (see Figure 2 & Table 1). However, the capacitance of the output filter capacitor must be appropriate. If the capacitance is too \nhigh, a startup problem might arise. For every channel of the output, to ensure safe and reliable operation, the maximum capacitance \nmust be less than the maximum capacitive load (see Table 2). It’s not recommended to connect any external capacitors in applica -\ntions with less than 0.5 watt output.APPLICATION NOTES\nNote:  1. Operation under minimum load will not damage the converter; however, they may not meet all specifications listed.  \n 2. Max. capacitive load tested at input voltage range and full load.  \n 3. It is recommended to use either ceramic capacitors or electrolytic capacitors on the input and the output. Using tantalum capacitors may increase the risk of failure.\n 4.
