The ceramic element of this product is fragile, and    care must be taken not to load an excessive     press-force or not to cause a shock at handling.    Such forces may cause cracking or chipping.    Especially under high-temperature environment,     there is a possibility that epoxy resin will become soft.    When you set up the processing environment, please     examine the processing method after evaluating the     quality of this product.2. Do not apply excessive force to the lead.    Otherwise, it may cause the junction between lead and     element to break or crack.    Holding the element by the side lead wire is recommended    when lead wire is bent or cut.    Handle the lead with care; there is a possibility    that a crack may go into the polyurethane    insulated coat when bending the lead.Please note as shown below when you mount this product.1. Do not melt the solder in the resin head, when you solder    this product. If you melt the solder in resin the head,     the wire could break and short.    If you cut the lead wire of this product less than 8mm     from the resin head, the heat of the melted solder at the     lead wire edge is propagated easily to the resin head     along the lead wire. Please do not cut this product below     9mm.2. Do not touch the resin head directly with the solder iron.     It may cause the melting of solder in the resin head.3.
