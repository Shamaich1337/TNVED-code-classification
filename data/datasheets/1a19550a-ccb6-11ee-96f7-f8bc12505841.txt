Each type embeds internal current\nlimiting, thermal shut-down and safe area protection, making it essentially\nindestructible. If adequate heat sinking is provided, they can deliver over 1 A output\ncurrent. Although designed primarily as fixed voltage regulators, these devices can\nbe used with external components to obtain adjustable voltage and currents.\nMaturity status link\nL78Positive voltage regulator ICs\nL78\nDatasheet\nDS0422  - Rev 36  - September 2018\nFor further information contact your local STMicroelectronics sales office.www.st.com\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\n1 Diagram\nFigure 2.

In many low current applications,\ncompensation capacitors are not required. However, it is recommended that the regulator input be bypassed with\ncapacitor if the regulator is connected to the power supply filter with long lengths, or if the output load capacitance\nis large. An input bypass capacitor should be selected to provide good high frequency characteristics to insure\nstable operation under all load conditions. A 0.33 µF or larger tantalum, mylar or other capacitor having low\ninternal impedance at high frequencies should be chosen. The bypass capacitor should be mounted with the\nshortest possible leads directly across the regulators input terminals. Normally good construction techniques\nshould be used to minimize ground loops and lead resistance drops since the regulator has no external sense\nlead.\nThe addition of an operational amplifier allows adjustment to higher or intermediate values while retaining\nregulation characteristics. The minimum voltage obtained with the arrangement is 2 V greater than the regulator\nvoltage.\nThe circuit of Figure 14. High current voltage regulator  can be modified to provide supply protection against short\ncircuit by adding a short circuit sense resistor, RSC, and an additional PNP transistor. The current sensing PNP\nmust be able to handle the short circuit current of the three terminal regulator Therefore a four ampere plastic\npower transistor is specified.\nFigure 9. Fixed output regulator\nGAMG220920161007MT\n1. Although no output capacitor is need for stability, it does improve transient response.\n2.

Protection against input short-circuit with high capacitance loads\nGAMG220920161026MT\nNote: Application with high capacitance loads and an output voltage greater than 6 volts need an external diode (see\nFigure 23. Reducing power dissipation with dropping resistor ) to protect the device against input short circuit. In\nthis case the input voltage falls rapidly while the output voltage decrease slowly. The capacitance discharges by\nmeans of the base-emitter junction of the series pass transistor in the regulator. If the energy is sufficiently high,\nthe transistor may be destroyed. The external diode by-passes the current from the IC to ground.L78\nDesign consideration \nDS0422  - Rev 36 page 29/55\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\n7 Typical performance\nFigure 29.
