Synchronous rectification enables high efficiency in the low profile 2mm × 2mm DFN package. Battery life in \nsingle AA/AAA powered products is extended further with a 680mV start-up voltage and operation down to 500mV once started.\nA switching frequency of 2MHz minimizes solution foot-\nprint by allowing the use of tiny, low profile inductors and ceramic capacitors. The current mode PWM design is internally compensated, reducing external parts count. The L TC3526L-2 features Burst Mode operation at light load conditions allowing it to maintain high efficiency over a wide range of load. The L TC3526LB-2 features fixed frequency operation for low noise applications. Anti-ring circuitry reduces EMI by damping the inductor in discon-tinuous mode.

With a guaranteed ability to start up and oper-ate from inputs less than 0.8V , this device features fixed frequency, current mode PWM control for exceptional line and load regulation. The current mode architecture with adaptive slope compensation provides excellent transient load response, requiring minimal output filtering. Internal soft-start and internal loop compensation simplifies the design process while minimizing the number of external components.\nWith its low R\nDS(ON)  and low gate charge internal N-channel \nMOSFET switch and P-channel MOSFET synchronous recti-\nfier , the L TC3526L-2 achieves high efficiency over a wide range of load currents. Burst Mode operation maintains high efficiency at very light loads, reducing the quiescent current to just 9µA. Operation can be best understood by referring to the Block Diagram.\nLOW\n VOL TAGE START -UP\nThe L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2 include an independent \nstart-up oscillator designed to start up at an input voltage of 0.68V (typical). Soft-start and inrush current limiting are provided during start-up, as well as normal mode.\nWhen either V\nIN or V OUT exceeds 1.3V typical, the IC \nenters normal operating mode. When the output voltage \nLTC3526L-2/LTC3526LB-2\n\x183526lb2faexceeds the input by 0.24V , the IC powers itself from \nVOUT instead of V IN. At this point the internal circuitry has \nno dependency on the V IN input voltage, eliminating the \nrequirement for a large input capacitor . The input voltage can drop as low as 0.5V . The limiting factor for the ap-plication becomes the availability of the power source to supply sufficient energy to the output at low voltages, and maximum duty cycle, which is clamped at 90% typical. Note that at low input voltages, small voltage drops due to series resistance become critical, and greatly limit the power delivery capability of the converter .\nLOW\n NOISE FIXED FREQUENCY OPERATION\nSoft-Start\nThe L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2 contain internal circuitry \nto provide soft-start operation. The soft-start circuitry slowly ramps the peak inductor current from zero to its peak value of 750mA (typical) in approximately 0.5ms, allowing start-up into heavy loads. The soft-start circuitry is reset in the event of a shutdown command or a thermal shutdown.\nOscillator\nAn internal oscillator sets the switching frequency to \n2MHz.\nShutdown\nShutdown is accomplished by pulling the SHDN  pin \nbelow 0.3V and enabled by pulling the SHDN pin above \n0.8V . Although SHDN can be driven above V\nIN or V OUT \n(up to the absolute maximum rating) without damage, \nthe L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2 have a proprietary test mode that may be engaged if SHDN is held in the range \nof 0.5V to 1V higher than the greater of V\nIN or V OUT. If \nthe test mode is engaged, normal PWM switching action is interrupted, which can cause undesirable operation in some applications. Therefore, in applications where SHDN may be driven above V\nIN, a resistor divider or other \nmeans must be employed to keep the SHDN voltage below \n(VIN + 0.4V) to prevent the possibility of the test mode \nbeing engaged. Please refer to Figure 1 for two possible implementations.Error Amplifier\nThe positive input of the transconductance error amplifier \nis internally connected to the 1.195V reference and the negative input is connected to FB. Clamps limit the mini-mum and maximum error amp output voltage for improved large-signal transient response. Power converter control loop compensation is provided internally. An external resistive voltage divider from V\nOUT to ground programs \nthe output voltage via FB from 1.5V to 5.25V .\n V VR\nROUT= +\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 1 195 12\n1. •\nCurrent Sensing\nLossless current sensing converts the peak current signal of \nthe N-channel MOSFET switch into a voltage that is summed with the internal slope compensation. The summed signal is compared to the error amplifier output to provide a peak current control command for the PWM.\nCurrent Limit\nThe current limit comparator shuts off the N-channel \nMOSFET switch once its threshold is reached. The cur-rent limit comparator delay to output is typically 60ns. Peak switch current is limited to approximately 750mA, independent of input or output voltage, unless V\nOUT falls \nbelow 0.7V , in which case the current limit is cut in half.(Refer to Block Diagram) opera Tion\nZETEX ZC2811E\n3526lb2 F01L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2\nSHDNVIN\nVCNTRL4M\n±30%L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2\nSHDN4M\n±30%\n1MR\nVCNTRL\n1M\nR > (V CNTRL /(VIN + 0.4) – 1)M/uni03A9\nFigure 1. Recommended Shutdown Circuits when Driving \nSHDN above V IN\nLTC3526L-2/LTC3526LB-2\n\x183526lb2faZero Current Comparator\nThe zero current comparator monitors the inductor cur-\nrent to the output and shuts off the synchronous rectifier when this current reduces to approximately 30mA. This prevents the inductor current from reversing in polarity, improving efficiency at light loads.\nSynchronous Rectifier\nTo control inrush current and to prevent the inductor \ncurrent from running away when V\nOUT is close to V IN, the \nP-channel MOSFET synchronous rectifier is only enabled when V\nOUT > (V IN + 0.24V).\nAnti-Ringing Control\nThe anti-ring circuit connects a resistor across the in-\nductor to prevent high frequency ringing on the SW pin during discontinuous current mode operation. Although the ringing of the resonant circuit formed by L and C\nSW \n(capacitance on SW pin) is low energy, it can cause EMI radiation.\nOutput Disconnect\nThe L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2 are designed to allow true \noutput disconnect by eliminating body diode conduction of the internal P-channel MOSFET rectifier . This allows for V\nOUT to go to zero volts during shutdown, drawing no cur-\nrent from the input source. It also allows for inrush current limiting at turn-on, minimizing surge currents seen by the input supply. Note that to obtain the advantages of output disconnect, there must not be an external Schottky diode connected between SW and V\nOUT. The output disconnect \nfeature also allows V OUT to be pulled high, without any \nreverse current into a battery connected to V IN.\nThermal Shutdown\nIf the die temperature exceeds 160°C, the L TC3526L-2/\nL TC3526LB-2 will go into thermal shutdown. All switches will be off and the soft-start capacitor will be discharged. The device will be enabled again when the die temperature drops by about 15°C.Burst Mode OPERATION\nThe L TC3526L-2 will enter Burst Mode operation at light \nload current and return to fixed frequency PWM mode when the load increases. Refer to the Typical Performance Characteristics to see the output load Burst Mode thresh-old current vs V\nIN. The load current at which Burst Mode \noperation is entered can be changed by adjusting the inductor value. Raising the inductor value will lower the load current at which Burst Mode operation is entered.\nIn Burst Mode operation, the L TC3526L-2 still switches at \na fixed frequency of 2MHz, using the same error amplifier and loop compensation for peak current mode control. This control method eliminates any output transient when switching between modes. In Burst Mode opera-tion, energy is delivered to the output until it reaches the nominal regulation value, then the L TC3526L-2 transi-tions to sleep mode where the outputs are off and the L TC3526L-2 consumes only 9µA of quiescent current from V\nOUT. When the output voltage droops slightly, switching \nresumes. This maximizes efficiency at very light loads by minimizing switching and quiescent losses. Burst Mode output voltage ripple, which is typically 1% peak-to-peak, can be reduced by using more output capacitance (10µF or greater), or with a small capacitor (10pF to 50pF) con-nected between V\nOUT and FB. \nAs the load current increases, the L TC3526L-2 will au-tomatically leave Burst Mode operation. Note that larger output capacitor values may cause this transition to oc-cur at lighter loads. Once the L TC3526L-2 has left Burst Mode operation and returned to normal operation, it will remain there until the output load is reduced below the burst threshold current.\nBurst Mode operation is inhibited during start-up and soft-\nstart and until V\nOUT is at least 0.24V greater than V IN.\nThe L TC3526LB-2 features continuous PWM operation at 2MHz. At very light loads, the L TC3526LB-2 will exhibit pulse-skipping operation.(Refer to Block Diagram) opera Tion\nLTC3526L-2/LTC3526LB-2\n\x1803526lb2faVIN > V OUT OPERATION\nThe L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2 will maintain voltage regu-\nlation even when the input voltage is above the desired output voltage. Note that the efficiency is much lower in this mode, and the maximum output current capability will be less. Refer to the Typical Performance Characteristics.\nSHOR\nT-CIRCUIT PROTECTION\nThe L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2 output disconnect feature \nallows output short circuit while maintaining a maximum internally set current limit. To reduce power dissipation under short-circuit conditions, the peak switch current limit is reduced to 400mA (typical).\nSCHOT\nTKY DIODE\nAlthough not recommended, adding a Schottky diode from \nSW to V OUT will improve efficiency by about 2%. Note \nthat this defeats the output disconnect and short-circuit protection features.\nPCB LA\nYOUT GUIDELINES\nThe high speed operation of the L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB -2 \ndemands careful attention to board layout. A careless \nlayout will \nresult in reduced performance. Figure 2 shows \nthe recommended component placement. A large ground pin copper area will help to lower the die temperature. A multilayer board with a separate ground plane is ideal, but not absolutely necessary.COMPONENT SELECTION\nInductor Selection\nThe L TC3526L-2/L TC3526LB-2 can utilize small surface \nmount chip inductors due to their fast 2MHz switching frequency. Inductor values between 1.5µH and 4.7µH are suitable for most applications. Larger values of inductance will allow slightly greater output current capability (and lower the Burst Mode threshold) by reducing the inductor ripple current. Increasing the inductance above 6.8µH will increase component size while providing little improvement in output current capability.\nThe minimum inductance value is given by:\n \nLV V V\nRipple VIN MIN OUT MAX IN MIN\nOU>( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) • –\n• • 2T T MAX ( )\nwhere:\nRipple = Allowable inductor current ripple (amps peak-\npeak)\nVIN(MIN)  = Minimum input voltage\nVOUT(MAX)  = Maximum output voltage\nThe inductor current ripple is typically set for 20% to \n40% of the maximum inductor current. High frequency ferrite core inductor materials reduce frequency depen-dent power losses compared to cheaper powdered iron types, improving efficiency. The inductor should have low ESR (series resistance of the windings) to reduce the I\n2R power losses, and must be able to support the peak \nFigure 2.

Multilayer ceramic capacitors are an excellent choice as they have extremely low ESR and are available in small footprints. A 4.7µF to 10µF output capacitor is sufficient for most ap-plications. Larger values may be used to obtain extremely low output voltage ripple and improve transient response. X5R and X7R dielectric materials are preferred for their ability to maintain capacitance over wide voltage and temperature ranges. Y5V types should not be used.\nThe internal loop compensation of the LTC3526L-2/ \nL TC3526LB-2 are designed to be stable with output ca-pacitor values of 4.7µF or greater (without the need for any external series resistor). Although ceramic capacitors are recommended, low ESR tantalum capacitors may be used as well.\nA small ceramic capacitor in parallel with a larger tantalum \ncapacitor may be used in demanding applications that have large load transients. Another method of improving the transient response is to add a small feed-forward capacitor across the top resistor of the feedback divider (from V\nOUT \nto FB). A typical value of 22pF will generally suffice.\nLow ESR input capacitors reduce input switching noise \nand reduce the peak current drawn from the battery. It follows that ceramic capacitors are also a good choice for input decoupling and should be located as close as possible to the device. A 2.2µF input capacitor is sufficient for most applications, although larger values may be used without limitations. Table 2 shows a list of several ceramic capacitor manufacturers. Consult the manufactur-ers directly for detailed information on their selection of ceramic capacitors.\nTable 2.
