When the input \nvoltage reaches the Zener voltage, V Z, Zener diode D1 conducts; therefore, allowing for the base-emitter \nvoltage, V BE, to increase. At V IN = V Z + V BE, the transistor starts conducting. From then on, its on-resistance \ndecreases linearly with increasing input voltage.\nFor negative transient voltages, only diode D2 determines the switching characteristic.

These TVS diodes provide a minimum breakdown \nvoltage of 6.5-V to protect USB transceivers and USB ASICs typically implemented in 3-V or 5-V digital CMOS \ntechnology.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\nTVS diodes possess two functional modes, a high-impedance and a conducting mode.\nDuring normal operating conditions, that is in the absence of high voltage transients, the breakdown voltage of \nTVS diodes is not exceeded and the devices remain high-impedance.\nIn the presence of high-voltage transients the breakdown voltage is exceeded. The TVS diodes then conduct \nand become low-impedance. In this mode excessive transient energy is shunted directly to local circuit ground, \npreventing USB transceivers from electrical damage.www.ti.comSN65220, SN65240, SN75240\nSLLS266J – FEBRUARY 1997 – REVISED AUGUST 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 7\nProduct Folder Links: SN65220  SN65240  SN75240\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\nThe USB has become a popular solution to connect PC peripherals. The USB allows devices to be hot-plugged \nin and out of the existing PC system without rebooting or turning off the PC. Because frequent human interaction \nwith the USB system occurs as a result of its attractive hot-plugging ability, there is the possibility for large \nESD strikes and damage to crucial system elements. The ESD protection included on the existing hardware \nis typically in the 2-kV to 4-kV range for the human body model (HBD) and 200-V to 300-V for the machine \nmodel (MM). The ESD voltage levels found in a normal USB operating environment can exceed these levels. \nThe SN75240, SN65240, and SN65220 devices will increase the robustness of the existing USB hardware to \nESD strikes common to the environment in which USB is likely to be used.\n10.2 Typical Application\nFigure 10-1  shows a typical USB system and application of the SN75240, SN65240, and SN65220 devices. \nConnections to pin A from the D+ data line, pin B from the D– data line, and the device grounds from the GND \nline that already exists are necessary to increase the amount of ESD protection provided to the USB port.\nThe design of the suppressor gives it very low maximum current leakage of 1 μA, a very low typical capacitance \nof 35 pF, and a standoff voltage minimum of 6 V. Because of these levels, the SN75240, SN65240, and \nSN65220 devices will provide added protection to the USB system hardware during ESD events without \nintroducing the high capacitance and current leakage levels typical of external transient voltage suppressors. \nThe addition of an SN75240, SN65240, or SN65220 device is beneficial to both full-speed and low-speed USB \n1.1 bandwidth standards.\nUSB hub port\ntransceiver\n27 \x01\n27 \x0015 k\x02  \n15 k\x03  SN65220 or ½ \nSNx5240GNDA\nBD+\nD-USB down stream\ntransceiver\n27 \x04\n27 \x051.5 k\x06(1)  \n1.5 k\x07(2)  SN65220 or ½ \nSNx5240GNDA\nBD+\nD-\n1) Full-speed only\n2) Low-speed only\nFigure 10-1.

In order to improve circuit \noperation, a connection to all ground pins must be provided on the system printed circuit board. Without proper \ndevice connection to ground, the speed and protection capability of the device will be degraded.\n•The ground termination pads should be connected directly to a ground plane on the board for optimum \nperformance. A single trace ground conductor will not provide an effective path for fast rise-time transient \nevents including ESD due to parasitic inductance.\n•Nominal inductive values of a PCB trace are approximately 20 nH/cm. This value may seem small, but an \napparent short length  of trace may be sufficient to produce significant L(di/dt) effects with fast rise-time ESD \nspikes.\n•Mount the TVS as close as possible to the I/O socket to reduce radiation originating from the transient as it is \nrouted to ground.\nNote\nDirect connective paths of the traces are taken to the suppressor mounting pads to minimize parasitic \ninductance in the surge-current conductive path, thus minimizing L(di/dt) effects.\n12.2 Layout Example\nUSB\nTransceiver\nA\nGND\nBNC\nNCSN65220USB\nConnector\nGND\n27 \r15 k\r\x03\nD+\nD-GND\nVBUS27 \r\n15 k\r\x03VIA to Power Ground Plane\nVIA to Power Supply Plane\nFigure 12-1.

#### Description:
The SN65220 is a dual unidirectional transient voltage suppressor (TVS) designed to protect USB low and full-speed ports from electrical noise transients. It integrates multiple TVS diodes that provide robust protection against electrostatic discharge (ESD) events, which can damage sensitive USB transceivers and ASICs. The device is particularly suited for applications requiring low capacitance and minimal leakage current, making it ideal for protecting submicron 3-V or 5-V circuits.

#### Typical Applications:
- **USB Protection:** The SN65220 is primarily used in USB full-speed host, hub, or peripheral applications to safeguard against ESD strikes and electrical noise transients.
- **Consumer Electronics:** It is suitable for devices that utilize USB connections, ensuring reliable operation during hot-plugging scenarios.
- **Industrial Equipment:** The component can be employed in industrial USB applications where robust ESD protection is critical.

This component is essential for enhancing the reliability and longevity of USB interfaces in various electronic devices, particularly in environments prone to electrical noise and ESD events.
