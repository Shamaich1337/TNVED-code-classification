General description\nThe PCF8574/74A provides general-purpose remote I/O expansion via the two-wire \nbidirectional I2C-bus (serial clock (SCL), serial data (SDA)).\nThe devices consist of eight quasi-bidirectional ports, 100 kHz I2C-bus interface, three \nhardware address inputs and interrupt output operating between 2.5 V and 6 V. The quasi-bidirectional port can be independently assigned as an input to monitor interrupt \nstatus or keypads, or as an output to acti vate indicator devices such as LEDs. System \nmaster can read from the input port or writ e to the output port through a single register.\nThe low current consumption of 2.5 \uf06dA (typical, static) is great for mobile applications and \nthe latched output ports directly drive LEDs.\nThe PCF8574 and PCF8574A are identical, except for the different fixed portion of the \nslave address. The three hardware address pins allow eight of each device to be on the \nsame I\n2C-bus, so there can be up to 16 of th ese I/O expanders PCF 8574/74A together on \nthe same I2C-bus, supporting up to 128 I/Os (for example, 128 LEDs).\nThe active LOW open-drain interrupt output (INT ) can be connected to the interrupt logic \nof the microcontroller and is ac tivated when any input state differs from its corresponding \ninput port register state. It is used to indicate  to the microcontroller that an input state has \nchanged and the device needs to be interrogated without the microcontroller continuously polling the input register via the I\n2C-bus.\nThe internal Power-On Reset (POR) initializes  the I/Os as inputs with a weak internal \npull-up 100 \uf06dA current source.\n2.

Functional description\nRefer to Figure 1 “ Block diagram ”.\n7.1 Device address\nFollowing a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is \naccessing and the operation it wants to perform (read or write). The address format of the PCF8574/74A is shown in Figure 6\n. Slave address pins A2, A1 and A0 are held HIGH or \nLOW to choose one of eight slave addresses. To conserve power, no internal pull-up resistors are incorporated on A2, A1 or A0, so they must be externally held HIGH or LOW. \nThe address pins (A2, A1, A0) can connect to V\nDD or V SS directly or through resistors.\n \nThe last bit of the first byte defines the oper ation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a \nread is selected, while a logic 0 selects a wr ite operation (write operation is shown in \nFigure 6 ).\n7.1.1 Address maps\nThe PCF8574 and PCF8574A are functionally the same, but have a different fixed portion \n(A6 to A3) of the slave address. This allows eight of the PCF8574 and eight of the \nPCF8574A to be on the same I2C-bus without address conflict.\n a. PCF8574 b. PCF8574A\nFig 6.

I/O programming\n8.1 Quasi-bidirectional I/Os\nA quasi-bidirectional I/O is an input or output po rt without using a direction control register. \nWhenever the master reads the register, the value returned to master depends on the \nactual voltage or status of the pin. At power on, all the ports are HIGH with a weak 100 \uf06dA \ninternal pull-up to V DD, but can be driven LOW by an internal transistor, or an external \nsignal. The I/O ports are entirely independent of each other, but each I/O octal is controlled by the same read or write data byte.\nAdvantages of the quasi-bidirectional I/O over totem pole I/O include:\n•Better for driving LEDs since the p-channel (transistor to V DD) is small, which saves \ndie size and therefore cost. LED drive only requires an internal transistor to ground, \nwhile the LED is connected to V DD through a current-limiting resistor. Totem pole I/O \nhave both n-channel and p-channel transis tors, which allow solid HIGH and LOW \noutput levels without a pull-up resistor — good for logic levels.\n•Simpler architecture — only a single register  and the I/O can be both input and output \nat the same time. Totem pole I/O have a dire ction register that specifies the port pin \ndirection and it is always in that confi guration unless the direction is explicitly \nchanged.\n•Does not require a command byte. The simplicity of one register (no need for the pointer register or, technically, the command byte) is an advantage in some \nembedded systems where every byte counts because of memory or bandwidth \nlimitations.Table 5.

The master reads the register to \ncheck the input status. If the external source pulls the port pin up to V DD or drives \nlogic 1, then the master will read the value of 1.\nInput LOW:  The master needs to write 1 to the register to set the port to input mode if \nthe device is not in the default power-on condition. The master reads the register to \ncheck the input status. If the external source pulls the port pin down to V SS or drives \nlogic 0, which sinks the weak 100 \uf06dA current source, then the master will read the value \nof 0.\nOutput HIGH:  The master writes 1 to the register. Th ere is an additional ‘accelerator’ or \nstrong pull-up current when the master sets the port HIGH. The additional strong pull-up \nis only active during the HIGH time of th e acknowledge clock cycle. This accelerator \ncurrent helps the port’s 100 \uf06dA current source make a faster rising edge into a heavily \nloaded output, but only at the start of the acknowledge clock cycle to avoid bus \ncontention if an external sign al is pulling the port LOW to V SS/driving the port with \nlogic 0 at the same time. After the ha lf clock cycle there is only the 100 \uf06dA current \nsource to hold the port HIGH.\nOutput LOW:  The master writes 0 to the register. There is a strong current sink \ntransistor that holds the port pin LOW. A large current may flow into the port, which \ncould potentially damage the part if the master  writes a 0 to the register and an external \nsource is pulling the port HIGH at the same time.\n \nFig 7.

The PCF8574/74A acknowledges \nand the master then sends the data byte for P7 to P0 to the port register. As the clock line goes HIGH, the 8-bit data is presented on the port lines after it has been acknowledged by the PCF8574/74A. If a LOW is written, the strong pull-down turns on and stays on. If a \nHIGH is written, the strong pull-up turns on for \n1⁄2of the clock cycle, then the line is held \nHIGH by the weak current source. The master can then send a STOP or ReSTART \ncondition or continue sending data. The nu mber of data bytes that can be sent \nsuccessively is not limited and the previous data is overwritten every time a data byte has been sent and acknowledged.\nEnsure a logic 1 is written for any port that is being used as an input to ensure the strong \nexternal pull-down is turned off.\n \nSimple code WRITE mode:\n<S> <slave address + write> < ACK > <data out> <ACK > <data out> < ACK > ... \n<data out> < ACK > <P>\nRemark: Bold type = generated by slave device.Fig 8.

To enter the Read mode the master (microcontroller) addresses the slave \ndevice and sets the last bit of the address byte to logic 1 (address byte read). The slave \nwill acknowledge and then send the data byte to the ma ster. The master will NACK and \nthen send the STOP condition or ACK and read the input register again.\nThe read of any pin be ing used as an output will indicate  HIGH or LOW depending on the \nactual state of the pin.\nIf the data on the input port changes faster than the master can read, this data may be \nlost. The DATA 2 and DATA3 are lost because these data did not meet the setup time and \nhold time (see Figure 9 ).\n \nSimple code for Read mode:\n<S> <slave address + read> < ACK > <data in > <ACK> ... <data in > <ACK> < data in > \n<NACK> <P>\nRemark: Bold type = generated by slave device.\n8.4 Power-on reset\nWhen power is applied to V DD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the \nPCF8574/74A in a reset condition until V DD has reached V POR. At that point, the reset \ncondition is released and the PCF8574/74A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine \nwill initialize to their default states of all I/O s to inputs with weak current source to V DD. \nThereafter V DD must be lowered below V POR and back up to the operation voltage for \npower-on reset cycle.A LOW-to-HIGH transition of SDA while SCL is HIGH is defined as the STOP condition (P). Transfer of data can be stopped at \nany moment by a STOP condition. When this  occurs, data present at the last acknowledge phase is valid (output mode). Input \ndata is lost.\nFig 9.

As soon as a port input is \nchanged, the INT  will be active (LOW) and notify the microcontroller.\nAn interrupt is genera ted at any rising or falling edge of  the port inputs. After time t v(Q), the \nsignal INT  is valid.\nThe interrupt will reset to HIGH when data on th e port is changed to the original setting or \ndata is read or written by the master.\nIn the Write mode, the interrupt may be reset (HIGH) on the rising edge of the \nacknowledge bit of the address byte and also on  the rising edge of the write to port pulse. \nThe interrupt will always be reset (HIGH) on the falling edge of the writ e to port pulse (see \nFigure 8 ).\nThe interrupt is reset (HIGH) in the Read mode on the rising edge of the read from port \npulse (see Figure 9 ).\nDuring the interrupt reset, any I/O change close to the read or write pulse may not generate an interrupt, or the interrupt will have a very short pulse. After the interrupt is \nreset, any change in I/Os will be detected and transmitted as an INT\n.\nAt power-on reset all ports are in Input mode and the initial state of the ports is HIGH, therefore, for any port pin that is pulled LOW or driven LOW by external source, the interrupt output will be active (output LOW).\n \nFig 10.

Characteristics of the I2C-bus\nThe I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-wire communication between different ICs or modules. The \ntwo wires are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply via a pull-up re sistor when connected to the output stages \nof a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n9.1 Bit transfer\nOne data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain \nstable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time \nwill be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 11 ).\n \n9.1.1 START and STOP conditions\nBoth data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW \ntransition of the data line while the clock is HI GH is defined as the START condition (S). A \nLOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP \ncondition (P) (see Figure 12 ).\n \n9.2 System configuration\nA device generating a message is a ‘transmitter ’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’.

Ea ch byte of eight bits is followed by one \nacknowledge bit (see Figure 14 ). The acknowledge bit is an active LOW level (generated \nby the receiving device) that indicates to the transmitter that the data transfer was \nsuccessful.\nA slave receiver which is addressed must gen erate an acknowledge af ter the reception of \neach byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte \nthat has been clocked out of the slave tran smitter. The device that wants to issue an \nacknowledge bit has to pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge bit related \nclock pulse; set-up and hold times must be taken into account.\nA master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an \nacknowledge on the last byte that has been cloc ked out of the slave. In this event, the \ntransmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP \ncondition.\n Fig 13.

Application design-in information\n10.1 Bidirectional I/O expander applications\nIn the 8-bit I/O expander application shown in Figure 15 , P0 and P1 are inputs, and \nP2 to P7 are outputs. When used in this configuration, during a write, the input (P0 and \nP1) must be written as HIGH so the external devices fully control the input ports . \nThe desired HIGH or LOW logic levels may be written to the ports used as outputs (P2 to \nP7). If 10 \uf06dA internal output HIGH is not enough current source, the port needs external \npull-up resistor. During a read, the logic leve ls of the external de vices driving the input \nports (P0 and P1) and the previ ous written logic level to the output ports (P2 to P7) will be \nread.\nThe GPIO also has an interrupt line (INT ) that can be connected to the interrupt logic of \nthe microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this lin e, the remote I/O informs the \nmicroprocessor that there has been a change of data on its ports without having to \ncommunicate via the I2C-bus.\n \n10.2 How to read and writ e to I/O expander (example)\nIn the application example of PCF8574 shown in Figure 15 , the microcontroller wants to \ncontrol the P3 switch ON and the P7 LED ON when the temperature sensor P0 changes.\n1. When the system power on: \nCore Processor needs to issue an initial command to set P0 and P1 as inputs and P[7:2] as outputs with value 1010 00 (LED off, MP3 off, camera on, audio off, \nswitch off and latch off).\n2. Operation:\nWhen the temperature changes above the th reshold, the temperature sensor signal \nwill toggle from HIGH to LOW. The INT\n will be activated and notifies the ‘core \nprocessor’ that there have been changes on the input pins. Read the input register. If P0 = 0 (temperature sensor has changed), then turn on LED and turn on switch.\n3.

In \napplications requiring additional drive, two por t pins may be connected together to sink up \nto 20 mA current. Both bits mu st then always be turned on or  off together. Up to five pins \ncan be connected together to drive 80 mA, which is the device recommended total limit. Each pin needs its own limiting resistor as shown in Figure 16\n to prevent damage to the \ndevice should all ports not be turned on at the same time.\n \n10.4 Migration path\nNXP offers newer, more capable drop-in replacements for the PCF8574/74A in newer \nspace-saving packages.\n \nPCA9670 replaces the interrupt output of the PCA9674 with hardware reset input to retain the maximum number of addresses and the PCA9672 replaces address A2 of the \nPCA9674 with hardware reset input to reta in the interrupt but limit the number of \naddresses.Fig 16.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n17.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n17.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from \na standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, \nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n17.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\nPCF8574_PCF8574A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2013.

It is imperative that the peak temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 11\n and 12\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 21 .Table 11.

Soldering of throug h-hole mount packages\n18.1 Introduction to solderi ng through-hole mount packages\nThis text gives a very brief insight into wave, dip and manual soldering.\nWave soldering is the preferred method for mounting of through-hole mount IC packages \non a printed-circuit board.\n18.2 Soldering by dipping or by solder wave\nDriven by legislation and environmental forc es the worldwide use of lead-free solder \npastes is increasing. Typical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from 3 seconds to 4 seconds at 250 \uf0b0C or 265 \uf0b0C, depending on solder material applied, SnPb \nor Pb-free respectively.\nThe total contact time of successive solder waves must not exceed 5 seconds.\nThe device may be mounted up to the seati ng plane, but the temperature of the plastic \nbody must not exceed the specified maximum storage temperature (T\nstg(max) ). If the \nprinted-circuit board has been pre-heated, forced cooling may be necessary immediately \nafter soldering to keep the temperature within the permissible limit.\n18.3 Manual soldering\nApply the soldering iron (24 V or less) to the lead(s) of the package, either below the seating plane or not more than 2 mm above it. If  the temperature of the soldering iron bit is \nless than 300 \uf0b0C it may remain in contact for up to 10 seconds.
