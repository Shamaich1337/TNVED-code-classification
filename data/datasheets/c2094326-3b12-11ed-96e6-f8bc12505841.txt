This family features a high performance sample -and-\nhold amplifier (SHA) and voltage refer ence. The AD9237 uses a \nmultistage differential pipelined architecture with output error \ncorrection logic to provide 12 -bit accuracy at 20  MSPS / \n40 MSPS/65 MSPS data rates and guarantees no missi ng codes \nover the full operating temperature range.  \nWith significant power savings over previously available ADC s, \nthe AD9237 is suitable for applications in imaging and medical \nultrasound.  \nFabri cated on an advanced CMOS process, the AD9237 is \navailable in a 32 -lead LFCSP  and is specified over the industrial \ntemperature range ( −40°C to +85°C).  PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS  \n1. Ope rating at 65 MSPS, th e AD9237 consumes a low 190  mW  \nat 65 MSPS, 135 mW at 40 MSPS, and 85 mW at 20 MSPS.  \n2. Power scaling reduces the operating power further when \nrunning at lower speeds.  \n3. The AD9237 operates from a single 3 V power supply and \nfeatures a separate digital output driver supply to \naccommodate 2.5 V and 3.3 V logic families.  \n4. The patented SHA input maintains excellent performance \nfor input frequencie s beyond Nyquist and can be configured \nfor single -ended or differential operation.  \n5. The AD9237 is optimized for selectable and flexible input \nranges from 1 V p -p to 4 V p- p. \n6. An output enable pin a llows for multiplexing of the outputs.  \n7. Two -step power -down supports a stan dby mode in addition \nto a power -down mode.  \n8. The OTR output bit indicates when the signal is beyond the \nselected input range.  \n9. The clock duty cycle stabilizer (DCS) maintains converter \nperformance over a wide range of clock pulse widths.  \n \nAD9237  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

The point used  \nas negative full scale occurs ½  LSB before the first code \ntransition. Positive full scale is defined as a level 1 ½ LSBs \nbeyond the last cod e transition. The deviation is measured  \nfrom the middle of each particular code to the true straight line.  \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL, No Missing Codes)  \nAn ideal ADC exhibits code transitions that are exactly 1  LSB \napart. DNL is the deviation from this  ideal value. Guaranteed \nno missing codes to 12 -bit resolution indicates that all 4096 \ncodes must be present over all operating ranges.  \nOffset Error  \nThe major carry transition should occur for an analog value  \n½ LSB below VIN+ = VIN –. Offset error is define d as the \ndeviation of the actual transition from that point.  \nGain Error  \nThe first code transition should occur at an analog value  \n½ LSB above negative full scale. The last transition should occur \nat an analog value 1 ½ LSB below the positive full scale. Gai n \nerror is the deviation of the actual difference between first and last code transitions and the ideal difference between first and \nlast code transitions.  \nTemperature Drift  \nThe temperature drift for offset error and gain error specifies \nthe maximum change  from the initial (25°C) value to the value \nat T\nMIN or T MAX. \nPower Supply Rejection Ratio  \nThe change in full scale from the value with the supply at the minimum limit to the value with the supply at its maximum \nlimit.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)\n1 \nThe r atio of the rms sum of the first six harmonic components \nto the rms value of the measured input signal.  Signal -To-Noise and Distortion (SINAD)1 \nThe ratio of the rms signal amplitude to the rms value of the \nsum of all other  spectral components below the Nyquist \nfrequency, including harmonics but excluding dc.  \nEffective Number of Bits (ENOB)  \nThe effective number of bits for a device for sine wave inputs  \nat a given input frequency can be calculated directly from its \nmeasured S INAD using the following formula: \nENOB  = (SINAD dBFS − 1.76)/6.02 \nSignal -to-Noise Ratio (SNR)1 \nThe ratio of the rms signal to the rms value of the sum of all \nother spectral components below the Nyquist frequency, excluding t he first six harmonics and dc.  \nSpurious -Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\n1 \nSFDR is the difference in dB between the rms amplitude of the input signal and the rms value of the peak spurious signal. The peak spurious signal may not b e an harmonic.  \nTwo -Tone SFDR\n1 \nThe ratio of the rms value of either input tone to the rms value of the peak spurious component. The peak spurious component may or may not be an IMD product.  \nClock Pulse  Width and Duty Cycle  \nPulse width high is the minimum amount of time that the clock \npulse should be left in the Logic 1 state to achieve rated performance. Pulse  width low is the minimum time the clock \npulse should be left in the low state. At a given clock rate, these \nspecifica tions define an acceptable clock duty cycle.  \nMinimum Conversion Rate  \nThe clock rate at which the SNR of the lowest analog signal \nfrequency drops by no more than 3 dB below the guaranteed \nlimit.  \nMaximum Conversion Rate  \nThe clock rate at which parametric tes ting is performed.  \nOutput Propagation Delay (t\nPD) \nThe delay between the clock logic threshold and the time when \nall bits are within valid logic levels.  \nOut -of-Range Recovery Time  \nThe time it takes the  ADC to reacquire the analog input after a \ntransition fr om 10% above positive full scale to 10% above \nnegative full scale, or from 10% below negative full scale to 10% \nbelow positive full scale.  \n \n1 AC specifications may be reported in dBc (degrades as signal levels are \nlowered) or in dBFS (always relat ed back to converter full scale).  \nAD9237  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 16 of 24 APPLYING THE AD9237 \nTHEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD9237 uses a calibrated, 11 -stage pipeline architecture \nwith a patented input SHA implemented. Ea ch stage of the \npipeline, excluding the last, consists of a low resolution flash \nADC connected to a switched capacitor digital -to-analog \nconverter (DAC) and an interstage residue amplifier (MDAC). \nThe MDAC magnifies the differen ce between the reconstructed  \nDAC output and the flash input for the next stage in the \npipeline. One bit of redundancy is used in each stage to facilitate \ndigital correction of flash errors. The last stage consists of a flash ADC. \nThe pipelined architecture permits the first stage to operate on a \nnew input sample , while the remaining stages operate on prec eding \nsamples. While the converter captures a new input sample every clock cycle, it takes eight clock cycles for the conversion to be fully processed and to appear at the output , as shown in Figure 2. \nThe input stage contains a differential SHA that can be ac - or \ndc-coupled in differential or single -ended modes. The output -\nstaging block aligns the data, carries out the error correction, and passes the data t o the output buffers. The output buffers  \nare powered from a separate supply, allowing adjustment of  \nthe output voltage swing. During power -down and stand -by \noperation, the output buffers go into a high impedance state.  \nThe ADC samples the analog input on  the rising edge of  \nthe clock. System disturbances just prior to , or immediately \nfollowing, the rising edge of the clock and/or excessive clock \njitter can cause the SHA to acquire the wrong input value and \nshould be minimized.  \nANALOG INPUT AND REF ERENCE OVERVIEW  \nThe analog input to the AD9237  is a differential switched \ncapacitor SHA that has been designed for optimum performance while processing a differential input signal.  \nThe SHA  input can sup port a wide common -mode range  \nand maintain excellent performance, as shown in Figure 34.  \nAn input common -mode voltage of midsupply minimizes \nsignal- dependant errors and provides optimum performance.  \nFigure  35 shows  the clock signal alternately switch ing the  \nSHA between sample mode and hold mode. When the SHA is switched into sample mode, the signal source must be capable of charging the sample capacitors and settling within one -half \nof a clock cycle. A sm all resistor in series with each input can \nhelp reduce the peak transient current required from the output stage of the driving source.

AD9237- 65 SNR /SFDR  vs. Input Common -Mode Level \nIn addition , a small shunt capacitor placed across the inputs  \nprovide s dynamic charging currents. This passive network \ncreates a low -pass filter at the ADC’s input; therefore, the \nprecise values are dependent  on the application.  In IF under -\nsampling applications, the  shunt capacitor (s) should be reduced \nor removed  depending on the input frequency . In combination \nwith the driving source impedance, the capacitors limit the input bandwidth.  \n05455-039VIN+\nVIN–CPAR\nCPAR5pF\n5pFT\nTH\nTT\nH \nFigure 35. Switched -Capacitor SHA Input \nFor best dynamic performance, the source impedances driving VIN+ and VIN – should be matched so that common -mode \nsettling errors are symmetrical. These errors are reduced by the \ncommon -mode rejection of the ADC.  \nAn internal differential reference buffer creates positive and \nnegative reference voltages, REFT and REFB, that define the \nspan of the ADC core.  \nData Sheet AD9237\n \nRev. C | Page 17 of 24 The output common mode of the reference buffer is set to mid-\nsupply, and the REFT and REFB voltages and input span are \ndefined as: \nREFT = ½( AVDD + VREF) \nREFB  = ½( AVDD  − VREF) \n\uf028\uf029\nFactor SpanVREF\nFactor SpanREFB REFTSpan_4\n_4 \uf0b4\uf03d\uf02d \uf0b4\uf03d  \nThe previous equations show that the REFT and REFB voltages \nare symmetrical about the midsupply voltage, and the input \nspan is proportional to the value of the VREF voltage, see Table 7 for more details. \nThe internal voltage reference can be pin strapped to fixed \nvalues of 0.5 V or 1.0 V , or adjusted within this range as \ndiscussed in the Internal Reference Connection section. \nMaximum SNR performance is achieved with the AD9237  \nset to an input span of 2 V p-p or greater. The relative SNR degradation is 3 dB when changing from 2 V p-p mode to  \n1 V p-p mode. \nThe SHA must be driven from a source that keeps the signal \npeaks within the allowable range for the selected reference \nvoltage. The minimum and maximum common-mode input \nlevels are defined as: \nVCM\nMIN = VREF/2 \nVCM MAX = (AVDD + VREF)/2 \nThe minimum common-mode input level allows the AD9237 to \naccommodate ground-referenced inputs. \nAlthough optimum performance is achieved with a differential \ninput, a single-ended source can be driven into VIN+ or VIN–. \nIn this configuration, one input accepts the signal while the \nopposite input should be set to midscale by connecting it to an \nappropriate reference. For example, a 2 V p-p signal can be applied to VIN+ while a 1 V reference is applied to VIN–. The AD9237 then accepts an input signal varying between 2 V and 0 V . In the single-ended configuration, distortion performance may degrade significantly as compared to the differential case. \nHowever, the effect is less noticeable at lower input frequencies and \nin the lower speed grade models (AD9237-40 and AD9237-20). \nDifferential Input Configurations \nAs previously detailed, optimum performance is achieved while \ndriving the AD9237 in a differential input configuration. For \nbaseband applications, the AD8351 differential driver provides \nexcellent performance and a flexible interface to the ADC. The \noutput common-mode voltage of the AD8351 is easily set to \nAVDD/2, and the driver can be configured in a Sallen-Key filter topology to provide band limiting of the input signal. Figure 36 details a typical configuration using the AD8351. \n05455-041AD8351 AD9237VIN+AVDD\nAGNDVIN––+33\uf0571k\uf057\n0.1\uf06dF\n0.1\uf06dF33\uf05715pF0.1\uf06dF\n0.1\uf06dF1.2k\uf057\n25\uf057\n1k\uf05749.9\uf05725\uf057\n2V p-p\n \nFigure 36. Differential Input Configuration Using the AD8351 \nAt input frequencies in the second Nyquist zone and above, the \nperformance of most amplifiers is not adequate to achieve the \ntrue performance of the AD9237. This is especially true in IF \nundersampling applications where frequencies in the 70 MHz  to 100 MHz range are being sampled. For these applications, differential transformer coupling is the recommended input configuration, as shown in Figure 37.   \n05455-042AD9237VIN+AVDD\nAGNDVIN–33\uf057\n0.1\uf06dF33\uf05715pF\n1k\uf057\n1k\uf0572V p-p49.9\uf057\n \nFigure 37. Differential Transformer-Coupled Configuration \nThe signal characteristics must be considered when selecting a \ntransformer. Most RF transformers saturate at frequencies \nbelow a few MHz, and excessive signal power can cause core \nsaturation, which leads to distortion. \nSingle-Ended Input Configuration \nA single-ended input can provide adequate performance in \ncost-sensitive applications. In this configuration, there is \ndegradation in SFDR and distortion performance due to the \nlarge input common-mode swing. However, if the source impedances on each input are matched, there should be little effect on SNR performance. Figure 38 details a typical single-\nended input configuration. \n05455-099AD9237VIN+AVDD\nAGNDVIN–33\uf0570.1\uf06dF\n33\uf05715pF\n1k\uf0571k\uf057\n1k\uf057\n1k\uf057\n25\uf0570.1\uf06dF49.9\uf0572V p-p\n \nFigure 38.

The input range can be adjusted by varying  \nthe reference voltage applied to the AD9237, using either the \ninternal reference or an externally applied reference voltage. The input span of the ADC tracks reference voltage changes linearly.  \nIn all reference configurations, REFT and REFB drive the  \nA/D conversion core and, in conjunction with the span factor, \nestablish its input span. The input range of the ADC always equals four times the voltage at the r eference pin divided by  \nthe span factor for either an internal or an external reference.  \nIt is required to decouple REFT to REFB with 0.1 µF and 10 µF \ndecoupling capacitors, as shown in Figure 39. \nInternal Reference Connection  \nA comparator within the AD9237 detects the potential at  \nthe SENSE pin and configures the reference into one of four \npossible states, which are summarized in Table 7. If SE NSE is \ngrounded, the reference amplifier switch is connected to the \ninternal resistor divider, setting VREF to 1 V  (see Figure 39). \nConnecting the SENSE pin to VREF switches the reference \namplifier output to the SENSE pin, completi ng the loop and \nproviding a 0.5 V reference output. If a resistor divider is \nconnected, as shown in Figure 40, then the switch is again set to  \nthe SENSE pin.

When \nmultiple ADCs track on e another, a single reference (internal or \nexternal) reduce s gain matching errors.  \nWhen the SENSE pin is connected  to AVDD, the internal \nreference is disabled, allowing the use of an external reference. \nAn internal reference buffer load s the external reference with  \nan equivalent 7 k Ω load.

VREF Accuracy vs. Load  CLOCK INPUT CONSIDER ATIONS  \nTypical high speed ADCs use both clock edges to generate  \na variety of internal timing signals and , as a result , can be \nsensitive to clock duty cycle. Commonly a 5% tolera nce is \nrequired on the clock duty cycle to maintain dynamic \nperformance characteristics. The AD9237 contains a clock  \nduty cycle stabilizer (DCS) that retimes the nonsampling, or falling edge, pr oviding an internal clock signal with a nominal \n50% duty cycle. This allows a wide range of clock input duty cycles without affecting the performance of the AD9237. As shown in Figure 17, noise and distortion performance are \nnearly flat over a 30% range of duty cycle  with the DCS enabled . \nThe duty cycle stabilizer uses a delay -locked loop (DLL) to \ncreate the nonsampling edge. As a result, any changes to the sampling freque ncy require approximately 100 clock cycles to \nallow the DLL to acquire and lock to the new rate.  \nHigh speed, high resolution ADCs are sensitive to the quality  \nof the clock input. The degradation in SNR at a given full -scale \ninput frequency (f\nINPUT ) due on ly to rms aperture jitter (t J) can \nbe calculated by  \n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\nπ=\nJ INPUTt flog n DegradatioSNR212010  \nIn th is equation, the rms aperture jitter represents the root -\nsum -square of all jitter sources, which include the clock input, \nanalog input signal, and ADC aperture jitter specific ation. \nUndersampling applications are particularly sensitive to jitter.  \nThe clock input should be treated as an analog signal in  \ncases where aperture jitter can  affect the dynamic range of the \nAD9237. Power supplies for clock drivers should be separated \nfrom the ADC output driver supplies to avoid modulating the clock signal with digital noise. Low jitter, crystal- controlled \noscillators make the best clock sources. If the clock is generated from another type of source (such as gating, dividing, or other \nmethods), then it should be retimed by the original clock at the \nlast step.  \nThe lowest typical conversion rate of the AD9237 is 1 MSPS. At \nclock rates below 1 MSPS, dynamic performance may  degrade.  \nPOWER DISSIPATION, POWER SCALING, AND \nSTANDBY MODE  \nAs shown in Figure 43, the power dissipated by the AD9237 is \nproportional to its sample rate. The digital power dissipation does not vary substantially between the three speed grades because it is determined primarily by the strength of the digital \ndrivers and the load on each output bit. The maximum DRVDD \ncurre nt can be calculated as  \nN f C V ICLK LOAD DRVDD DRVDD ×××=  \nwhere N is 12, the number of output bits.  \nAD9237 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 20 of 24 This maximum current occurs when every output bit switches \non every clock cycle, that is, a full-scale square wave at the \nNyquist frequency, f CLK/2. In practice, the DRVDD current is \nestablished by the average number of output bits switching, \nwhich is determined by the encode rate and the characteristics \nof the analog input signal. \nSAMPLE RATE (MSPS)POWER (mW)190\n170150130\n110\n90\n70\n10 60 65 50 40 30 20\n05455-047AD9237-65\nAD9237-40\nAD9237-20\n \nFigure 43. Total Power vs. Sample Rate with f IN = 10 MHz  \nFor the AD9237-20 speed grade, the digital power consumption \ncan represent as much as 10% of the total dissipation. Digital \npower consumption can be minimized by reducing the capacitive load presented to the output drivers. The data in \nFigure 43 was taken with a 5 pF load on each output driver. \nThe AD9237 is designed to provide excellent performance with \nminimum power. The analog circuitry is optimally biased so \nthat each speed grade provides excellent performance while affording reduced power consumption. Each speed grade \ndissipates a baseline power at low sample rates that increases \nlinearly with the clock frequency, as shown in Figure 43. \nThe power scaling feature provides an additional power savings \nwhen enabled, as shown in Figure 44. The power scaling mode \ncannot be enabled if the clock is varied during operation. This is \nbecause the internal circuitry cannot quickly track a changing clock, and the part does not have enough power to operate \nproperly.

In this state, the ADC typically dissipates \n1 mW . During power-down, the output drivers are placed in a high impedance state. Low power dissipation in power-down mode is achieved by shutting down the reference, reference \nbuffer, biasing networks, clock, and duty cycle stabilizer \ncircuitry. The decoupling capacitors on REFT and REFB are discharged when entering power-down mode and then must  \nbe recharged when returning to normal operation. \nAs a result, the wake-up time is related to the time spent  \nin power-down mode and shorter standby cycles result in \nproportionally shorter wake-up times. With the recommended 0.1 μF and 10 μF decoupling capacitors on REFT and REFB, it \ntakes approximately 1 sec to fully discharge the reference buffer \ndecoupling capacitors and 3 ms to restore full operation. \n \nData Sheet AD9237\n \nRev. C | Page 21 of 24 By asserting the PDWN pin to AVDD/3, the AD9237 is placed \nin standby mode. In this state, the ADC typically dissipates \n20 mW . The output drivers are placed in a high impedance state. The reference circuitry is enabled, allowing for a quick start upon bringing the ADC into normal operating mode. \nDIGITAL OUTPUTS \nThe AD9237 output drivers can be configured to interface with \n2.5 V or 3.3 V logic families by matching DRVDD to the digital supply of the interfaced logic. The output drivers are sized to provide sufficient output current to drive a wide variety of logic families. However, large drive currents tend to cause current glitches on the supplies that can affect converter performance. Applications requiring the ADC to drive large capacitive loads or large fanouts may require external buffers or latches. \nThe length of the output data lines and loads placed on them \nshould be minimized to reduce transients within the AD9237; \nthese transients can detract from the converter’s dynamic \nperformance. \nAs detailed in Table 10, the data format can be selected for \neither offset binary, twos complement, or gray code. \nOperational Mode Selection \nThe AD9237 can output data in either offset binary, twos \ncomplement, or gray code format. There is also a provision  \nfor enabling or disabling the duty cycle stabilizer (DCS).  The MODE pin is a multilevel input that controls the data \nformat (except for gray code) and DCS state. The MODE pin  \nis internally pulled down to AGND by a 70 kΩ resistor. The input threshold values and corresponding mode selections are \noutlined in Table 10. \nThe gray code output format is obtained by connecting GC to \nAVDD. When the part is in gray code mode, the MODE pin \ncontrols the DCS function only. The GC pin is internally pulled \ndown to AGND by a 70 kΩ resistor. \nTable 10. MODE Selection \nMODE Voltage Data Format Duty Cycle Stabilizer \nAVDD Twos Complement Disabled \n2/3 AVDD Twos Complement Enabled \n1/3 AVDD Offset Binary Enabled \nAGND (Default) Offset Binary Disabled \n \nOut of Range (OTR) \nAn out-of-range condition exists when the analog input voltage \nis beyond the input range of the ADC. The OTR pin is a digital \noutput that is updated along with the data output corresponding \nto the particular sampled input voltage. Therefore, the OTR pin has the same pipeline latency as the digital data. OTR is low when the analog input voltage is within the analog input range, and high when the analog input voltage exceeds the input range, \nas shown in Figure 45. OTR remains high until the analog input \nreturns to within the input range and another conversion is completed. By logically AND-ing OTR with the MSB and its complement, overrange high or underrange low conditions can be detected. Table 11 is a truth table for the overrange/ under-range circuit in Figure 46, which uses NAND gates. Systems \nrequiring programmable gain condition of the AD9237 can, \nafter eight clock cycles, detect an out-of-range condition; therefore, eliminating gain selection iterations. In addition, \nOTR can be used for digital offset and gain calculation. \n05455-049–FS – 1/2 LSBOTR\n–FS–FS + 1/2 LSB\n–FS – 1/2 LSB+FS – 1 LSB\n+FS1    1111 1111 1111\n0    1111 1111 1111\n0    1111 1111 1110\n0    0000 0000 0001\n0    0000 0000 0000\n0    0000 0000 0000OTR DATA OUTPUT S\n \nFigure 45.
