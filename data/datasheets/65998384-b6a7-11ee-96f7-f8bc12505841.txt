Precautions for Use \nThis product is for use only with reflow soldering. It is desig ned to be mounted by solderin g. If you want to use other \nmounting method, for example, using a conductive adhesive, please consult us beforehand. \nAlso, if repeatedly subjected to temperatur e cycles or other thermal stress, due to the difference in the coefficient of therma l \nexpansion with the mounting substr ate, the solder (solder fillet part)  in the mounting part may crack. \nThe occurrence of cracks due to thermal stress is affected by  the size of the land where mounted, the solder volume, and \nthe heat dissipation of the mounting substrate. Carefully design it when a large change in ambient temperature is assumed. \n12.1 Land dimensions  \nThe following diagram shows the recommended land dimensions for reflow soldering:  \n<Applied to types excluding BLM15P □ type, BLM15AX type, BLM15KD type> \n a 0.4 \nb 1.2 \nc 0.5 \n(in mm) \n<Applied to BLM15P □ type, BLM15AX type, BLM15KD type> \n Rated \ncurrent \n(A) a b c Pattern thickness and \ndimension d \n18 μm 35 μm 70 μm \n1.5 or \nlower 0.4 1.2 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 \n2.2 or \nlower 0.4 1.2 0.5 1.2 0.7 0.5 \n3.0 or \nlower 0.4 1.2 0.5 2.4 1.2 0.5 \n4.0 or \nlower 0.4 1.2 0.5 2.4 1.2 1.0 \nIf heat generation from patterns is large, please pay attention since \nthe joint of products with substrates may deteriorate. \n(in mm) \n\nSpec No.: JENF243A_0018AN-01 P8/11 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD 12.2 Flux and solder used \nFlux • Use a rosin-based flux. \n• Do not use a highly acidic flux with a halide c ontent exceeding 0.2(wt)% (chlorine conversion value). \n• Do not use a water-soluble flux. \nSolder • Use Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu solder. \n• Standard thickness of solder paste: 100 μm to 200 μm \nIf you want to use a flux other than the above, please consult our technical department. \n12.3 Soldering conditions (reflow) \n• Pre-heating should be in such a way that the temperature difference between solder and product surface is limited to \n150°C max. Cooling into solvent after soldering also should be in such a way that the temperature differen ce is limited to 100°C max. \nInsufficient pre-heating may cause cracks on the produc t, resulting in the deterio ration of product quality. \n• Standard soldering profile and the lim it soldering profil e is as follows. \nThe excessive limit soldering conditions may cause leaching of  the electrode and/or resulting in the deterioration of \nproduct quality. \n \n Standard profile Limit profile \nPre-heating 150°C to 180°C/90 s±30 s 150°C to 180°C/90 s±30 s \nHeating Above 220°C/30 s to 60 s Above 230°C/60 s max. \nPeak temperature  245°C±3°C 260°C/10 s \nNumber of reflow cycles 2 times 2 times \n12.4 Reworking with soldering iron \nThe following requirements must be met to rework a soldered product using a soldering iron. \nItem Requirement \nPre-heating 150°C/approx. 1 min \nTip temperature of soldering iron 350°C max. \nPower consumption of so ldering iron 80 W max. \nTip diameter of soldering iron ø3 mm max. \nSoldering time 3 s (+1 s, -0 s) \nNumber of reworking operations 2 times max. \n* Avoid a direct contact of the tip of the soldering iron with the product.

A > D*1 \n(2) Add slits in the board separation part.  A > B \n(3) Keep the mounting position of the component away from the \nboard separation surface.  A > C \n*1 A > D is valid when stress is added vertical ly to the perforation as with hand separation. \nIf a cutting disc is used, stress will be diago nal to the PCB, therefore A > D is invalid. \n \n(3) Mounting components near screw holes \nWhen a component is mounted near a screw hole, it may be affected by the board deflec tion that occurs during the \ntightening of the screw. \nMount the component in a position as far away from the screw holes as possible. \n \n \n〈Poor example 〉 〈Good example 〉ba\n\nSpec No.: JENF243A_0018AN-01 P10/11 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD 12.7 Handling of substrate \nAfter mounting products on a substrate, do not apply any stress to the product caused by bending or twisting to the substrate \nwhen cropping the substrate, inserting and removing a connector from the substrate or tighteni ng screw to the substrate. \nExcessive mechanical stress may cause cracking in the product. \n  \nBending Twisting \n12.8 Cleaning \nWhen cleaning this product, observe the following conditions. \nAny cleaning may cause deterioration in the quality of the prod uct, so please check the quality of this product before use. \n(1) The cleaning temperature shall be 60°C max. If isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is used, the cleaning temperature shall be 40°C \nmax. \n(2) When ultrasonic cleaning is used, under some cleaning conditions, the substrate could resonate and the substrate \nvibrations could result in chip cracks, solder breakage, and other problems. Be sure to always perform a test cleaning \nbeforehand using an actual cleaning device, and then check the quality of the products. \n(3) Cleaner \nAlcohol-based cleaner: IPA \nAqueous agent: PINE ALPHA ST-100S \n(4) There shall be no residual flux or residual cleaner. \nWhen using aqueous agent, rinse the product with deionized wate r adequately and completely dry it so that no cleaner is \nleft. \n* For other cleaning, please cons ult our technical department. \n12.9 Storage and transportation \nStorage period Use the product within 6 months after delivery. \nIf you do not use the product for more than 6 months, check solderability before using it. \nStorage conditions • The products shall be stored in a room not subject to rapid changes in temperature and \nhumidity. The recommended temperature range is -10°C to +40°C. The recommended relative \nhumidity range is 15% to 85%. \nKeeping the product in corrosive gases, such as sulfur, chlorine gas or acid may cause the \npoor solderability. \n• Do not place the products directly on the floor;  they should be placed on a palette so that they \nare not affected by humidity or dust. \n• Avoid keeping the products in a place expose d to direct sunlight, heat or vibration. \n• Do not keep products in bulk packaging. Bulk storage could result in collisions between the \nproducts or between the products and other pa rts, resulting in chipping or wire breakage. \n• Avoid storing the product by itself bare (i.e. exposed directly to air). \nTransportation Excessive vibration and impact reduces t he reliability of the products. Exercise caution when \nhandling the products. \n12.10 Resin coating (including moisture-proof coating) \nWhen the product is coated/molded with resin,  its electrical characteristics may change. \nA wire breakage issue may occur by mechanical stress caused by the resin, amount/cured shape of resin, or operating \ncondition etc. Some resins contain impurities or hydrolyzable chlorine, which co uld result in corrosion of the conducting materials, leading \nto wire breakage. \nSo, please pay your careful attention when you select resin in  case of coating/molding the products with the resin. \nPrior to use the coating resin, please make sure no reliabili ty issue is observed by evaluating products mounted on your \nboard. \n12.11 Mounting conditions \nCheck the mounting condition before using. \nUsing mounting conditions (nozzles, equipment  conditions, etc.) that are not suitable for products may lead to pick up errors, \nmisalignment, or damage to the product. \n12.12 Operating environment \nDo not use this product under the following environmental cond itions as it may cause deterioration of product quality. \n(1) In the corrodible atmosphere such as acidic gases, al kaline gases, chlorine, sulfur gases, organic gases and etc. \n(the sea breeze, Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, NO2, etc) \n(2) In the atmosphere where liquid such as organic solvent, may splash on the products. \n(3) In the atmosphere where the temperature/humidity changes rapidly and it is easy to dew. \n\nSpec No.: JENF243A_0018AN-01 P11/11 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD 12.13 Mounting density \nIf this product is placed near heat-generating products, be su re to implement sufficient heat-dissipating measures. \nIf this product is subjected to a significant amount of heat from  other products, this could adversely affect product quality, \nresulting in a circuit malfunction or failure  of the mounted section. Also, be sure that  the product is used in a manner so tha t \nthe heat that the product is subjected to from other prod ucts does not exceed the upper limit of the rated operating \ntemperature for the product. \n \n13. \n Note \n(1) Please make sure that your product has been evaluated in vi ew of your specifications with our product being mounted to \nyour product. \n(2) You are requested not to use our product deviating from the reference specifications. \n(3) The contents of this reference specification are subjec t to change without advance notice.
