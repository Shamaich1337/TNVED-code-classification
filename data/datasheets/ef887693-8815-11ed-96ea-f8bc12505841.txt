Combining high speed CMOS and monolithic air \ncore transformer technology, these isolation components provi de \noutstanding performan ce char acteristics superior to alternatives , \nsuch as optocoupler devices. \nBy avoiding the use of LEDs and photodiodes, i Coupler devices \nremove the design difficulties commonly associated with opto -\ncouplers. The typical optocoupler concerns regarding uncertain \ncurrent transfer ratios, nonlinear transfer functions, and \ntemperature and lifetime effects are eliminated with the simple \niCoupler digital interfaces and stable performance characteristics.  \nThe need for external drivers and other discrete components is \neliminated with these iCoupler products. Furthermore, iCoupler  \ndevices consume one tenth to one  sixth of the power of \noptocouplers at comparable signal data rates.  \nThe ADuM1400/ ADuM1401 /ADuM1402 isolators provide four \nindependent  isolation channels in a variety of channel configu -\nrations and data rates (see the Ordering Guide ). All models \noperate with the supply voltage on either side ranging from 2.7 V to 5.5 V , providing compatibility with lower voltage \nsystems as well as enabling a voltage translation functionality across the isolation barrier. In addition, the ADuM1400 / \nADuM1401/ ADuM1402 provide  low pulse width distortion \n(<2 ns for CRW grade) and tight channel -to-channel m atching \n(<2 ns for CRW grade). Unlike other optocoupler alternatives, the \nADuM1400/ ADuM1401/ ADuM1402  isolators have a patented \nrefresh feature that ensures dc correctness in the absence of input  \nlogic transitions and when power is not applied to one of the supplies . \n \n1 Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952,849;  6,873,065;  6,903,578;  and 7,075,329.   \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAMS  \nENCODE DECODEENCODE DECODEENCODE DECODEENCODE DECODEVDD1\nGND1\nVIA\nVIB\nVIC\nVID\nNC\nGND1VDD2\nGND2\nVOA\nVOB\nVOC\nVOD\nVE2\nGND21\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n03786-001 \nFigure 1.

Output supply current valu es are specified with no output load \npresent. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data r ate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption  section. \nSee Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information on per -channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 11 through \nFigure 15 for total V DD1 and V DD2 supply currents  as a function of data rate for ADuM1400/ ADuM1401 /ADuM1402 channel c onfigurations.  \n3 The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n4 The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n5 tPHL propagati on delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ox signal. t PLH propagation delay is \nmeasured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ox signal.  \n6 tPSK is the magnitude of the worst -case difference in t PHL or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load \nwithin the recommended operating conditions.  \n7 Codirectional cha nnel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the sa me side of \nthe isolation barrier. Opposing -directional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with \ninputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.  \n8 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining V O > 0.8 V DD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rat e \nthat can be sustained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The common -mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common -mode voltage edges. The transient \nmagnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.  \n9 Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information \non per -channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions.

Bypass capacitors are \nmost conven iently connected between Pin  1 and Pin 2 for V DD1 \nand between Pin 15 and Pin 16 for V DD2. The capacitor value \nshould be between 0.01 µF and 0.1 µF. The total lea d length \nbetween both ends of the capacitor and the input power supply pin should not exceed 20 mm . Bypassing between Pin 1 and Pin \n8 and between Pin  9 and Pin  16 should also be considered , \nunless the ground pair on each package side is connected close to the package.  \nVDD1\nGND 1\nVIA\nVIB\nVIC/VOC\nVID/VOD\nNC/V E1\nGND 1VDD2\nGND 2\nVOA\nVOB\nVOC/VIC\nVOD/VID\nVE2\nGND 2\n03786-017 \nFigure 17. Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout   \nIn applications involving high common -mode transients, care \nshould be taken to ensure that board  coupling across the isolation \nbarrier is minimized. Furthermore, the board layout should be designed such that any coupling that does occur equally affects all pins on a given component side. Failure to ensure this could cause voltage differentials between pins exceeding the Absolute \nMaximum Ratings  of the device , thereby leading to latch -up or \npermanent damage.  \nSee the AN -1109 Application Note  for board layout guidelines. \nPROPAGATION DELAY -RELATED PARAMETERS  \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it takes \na logic signal to propagate through a component. The propagation \ndelay to a Logic 0 output may differ from the propagation delay \nto a L ogic 1 output . \nINPUT (V Ix)\nOUTPUT (V Ox)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n03786-018 \nFigure 18. Propagation Delay Parameters  \nPulse width distortion is the maximum difference between these two propagation delay values and is an indication of how \naccurately the timing of the input signal is preserved.  \nChannel -to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthe propagation delay differs between channels within a single ADuM1400/ ADuM1401/ ADuM1402 component.  \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount the propagation d elay differs between multiple ADuM1400/  \nADuM1401/ ADuM1402 components operating under the same \nconditions.  DC CORRECTNESS AND M AGNETIC FIELD \nIMMUNITY  \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input  \ncause narrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the \ntransformer. The decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the  \nabsence of logic transitions at the input for more than ~1  µs, a \nperiodic set of  refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state \nare sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses of more than about 5 µs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case the isolato r output is forced to a default state (see  Table 15) \nby the watchdog timer circuit.  \nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the ADuM1400/  \nADuM1401/ ADuM1402 is set by the condition in which ind uced  \nvoltage in the receiving coil of the transformer is sufficiently large \nenough to either falsely set or reset the decoder. The following \nanalysis defines the conditions under which this may occur. The 3 V operating condition of the ADuM1400/ ADuM1401/  \nADuM1402 is exami ned because it represents the most susceptible \nmode of operation.  \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater than 1.0  V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at about 0.5 V , thus \nestablishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be \ntolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by  \nV = (−dβ/dt )∑∏r\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N  \nwhere:  \nβ is magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM1400/  \nADuM1401/ ADuM1402 and an imposed requirement that the \ninduced voltage be 50% at most of the 0.5 V margin at the \ndecoder, a maximum allowable magnetic field is calculated as \nshown in Figure 19.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n03786-019 \nFigure 19.

L | Page 28 of 31 For example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magn etic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the \nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if such an event occur s during a transmitted pulse \n(and has the worst -case pola rity), it reduce s the received pulse \nfrom >1.0  V to 0.75 V—still well above the 0.5 V sensing \nthreshold of the decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to specific current magnitudes at given distances from the ADuM1400/ ADuM1401/ ADuM1402 transformers. Figure 20 \nexpresses these allowable current magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected distances. As shown, the ADuM1400/  \nADuM1401/ ADuM1402 are extremely immune and can be \naffected only by ext remely large currents operated at high \nfrequency very close to the component. For the 1 MHz example noted, one would have to place a 0.5 kA current 5 mm away from the ADuM1400/ ADuM1401/ ADuM1402 to affect the \noperation  of the component . \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)1000\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n1k 10k 100M 100k 1M 10MDISTANCE = 5mmDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n03786-020 \nFigure 20. Maximum Allowable Current  for Various  \nCurrent -to-ADuM1400 /ADuM1401 /ADuM1402  Spacings  \nNote that at combinations of strong magnetic field and high frequency, any loops formed by printed circuit board traces could induce error voltages sufficiently large  enough to trigger \nthe thresholds of succeeding circuitry. Care should be taken in \nthe layout of such traces to avoid this possibility.  POWER CONSUMPTION  \nThe supply current at a given channel of the ADuM1400 / \nADuM1401/ ADuM1402 isolator  is a function of the supply \nvoltage, the data rate  of the channel , and the output load  of the \nchannel . \nFor each input channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDI = I DDI (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDI = IDDI (D)  × (2f − fr) + I DDI (Q) f > 0.5 f r \nFor each output channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDO = I DDO (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDO = (IDDO (D) + (0.5 × 10−3) × C L × V DDO) × (2 f − f r) + I DDO (Q) \n f > 0.5 f r \nwhere:  \nIDDI (D) , IDDO (D)  are the input and output dynamic supply currents \nper channel (mA/Mbps).  \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF).  \nVDDO is the output supply voltage (V).  \nf is the input logic signal frequency (MHz); it is half of the input \ndata rate expressed in units of Mbps.  \nfr is the input stage refresh rate (Mbps).  \nIDDI (Q) , IDDO (Q)  are the specified input and output quiescent  \nsupply  currents (mA).  \nTo calculate the total V DD1 and V DD2 supply current, the supply \ncurrents for each input and output channel corresponding to \nVDD1 and V DD2 are calculated and totaled. Figure 8 and Figure 9 \nprovide per -channel supply currents as a function of data rate \nfor an unloaded output condition. Figure 10 provides per -\nchannel supply current as a function of data rate for a 15  pF \noutput condition. Figure 11 through Figure 15 provide total \nVDD1 and V DD2 supply current as a function of data rate for \nADuM1400/ ADuM1401/ ADuM1402 channel configurations.  \nData Sheet  ADuM1400/ADuM1401/ADuM1402  \n \nRev. L | Page 29 of 31 INSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected \nto voltage stres s over a sufficiently long period. The rate of \ninsulation degradation is depende nt on the characteristics of  \nthe voltage waveform applied across the insulation. In addition \nto the testing performed by the regulatory agencies, Analog Devices carries out an  extensive set of evaluations to determine \nthe lifetime of the insulation structure within the ADuM1400 / \nADuM1401/ ADuM1402.  \nAnalog Devices  performs accelerated life testing using voltage \nlevels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Accel -\neration factors for several operating  conditions are determined. \nThese factors allow calculation of the time to failure at the actual  \nworking voltage. The values shown in  Table 14 summari ze the \npeak voltage for 50 years of service life for a bipolar ac operating  \ncondition and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working voltages. In many cases, the approved wo rking voltage is higher \nthan a 50-year service life voltage. Operation at these high work ing \nvoltages can lead to shortened insulation life in some cases. \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM1400/ ADuM1401/  \nADuM1402 depends on the voltage waveform type imposed \nacross the isolation barrier. The iCoupler insulation structure \ndegrades at different rates depending on whether the waveform \nis bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 21, Figure 22, and Figure 23 \nillustrate these different is olation voltage waveforms , respectively . \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringen t environment. The goal \nof a 50- year operating lifetime under the ac bipolar condition \ndetermines the Analog Devices  recommended maximum \nworking voltage.  In the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insulation  \nis significantly lower , which allows operation at higher working \nvoltages while still achieving a 50 -year service life. The working \nvoltages listed in Table 14 can be applied  while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime , provided the voltage conforms to either \nthe unipolar ac or dc voltage cases. Any cross -insulation voltage \nwaveform that does not conform to Figure 22 or Figure 23 should \nbe treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak voltage should \nbe limited to the 50-year lifetime voltage value listed in Table 14. \nNote that the voltage presented in Figure 22 is shown as sinusoidal \nfor illustration purposes only. It is meant to represent any voltage \nwaveform varying bet ween 0  V and some limiting value.  The \nlimiting value can be positive or negative, but the voltage cannot cross 0 V . \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n03786-021 \nFigure 21.
