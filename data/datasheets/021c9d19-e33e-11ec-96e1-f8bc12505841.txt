### Component Summary: MC12093DG

**Description:**
The MC12093 is a low-power single modulus prescaler designed for frequency division of high-frequency input signals up to 1.1 GHz. It utilizes MOSAIC V™ technology to achieve low power dissipation and features a stand-by mode to minimize current drain. The prescaler can divide input frequencies by factors of 2, 4, or 8, selectable via control pins.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 2.7 V to 5.5 V DC
  - Maximum Power Supply Voltage: -0.5 V to 6.0 V DC

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Supply Current (ICC): 3.0 mA (typical), 4.5 mA (maximum)
  - Stand-By Current (ISB): 120 µA (typical), 200 µA (maximum)
  - Maximum Output Current (IO): 4.0 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Power Dissipation: 6.75 mW at minimum supply voltage

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to 85 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - SOIC-8 NB (D suffix) and DFN8 (MN suffix)

- **Special Features:**
  - On-chip output termination for driving a 2.0 pF load
  - Stand-by mode to reduce current drain
  - Pb-Free, Halogen Free, and RoHS Compliant

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (JEDEC J-STD-020E):**
  - Level 1 for both SOIC-8 NB and DFN8 packages

### Typical Applications:
The MC12093 is typically used in applications requiring frequency division, such as:
- **Communication Systems:** For signal processing in RF applications.
- **Data Transmission:** In systems where high-frequency signals need to be divided for further processing.
- **Test Equipment:** For generating lower frequency signals from high-frequency sources.
- **Consumer Electronics:** In devices that require frequency scaling for various functionalities.

This prescaler is ideal for low-power applications where efficiency and compact design are critical, making it suitable for battery-operated devices and portable electronics.
