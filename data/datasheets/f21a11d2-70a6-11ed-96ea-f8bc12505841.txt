Each part contains one driver \nand one receiver, which is designed for data transmission with extended common mode range \n(-7V to 12V). The UM3483E features slew-rate-limited driver which minimizes EMI and reduces \nreflections resulted from improperly terminated cables. The UM3483E allows up to 500kbps \nerror-free data transmission, while the partially slew-rate-limited UM3486E transmits at data rates \nup to 2.5Mbps. \nThe UM3483E, UM3486E also feature enhanced electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection. All of \nthe transmitter outputs and receiver inputs are protected to ±15kV using IEC61000-4-2 Air-Gap \nDischarge, ±15kV using the Human Body Model and ±8kV using IEC61000-4-2 Contact \nDischarge. \nDrivers are short-circuit current limited. When the driver outputs are placed into a \nhigh-impedance state by thermal shutdown circuitry, drivers are protected against excessive \npower dissipation. And the fail-safe feature of the receiver input guarantees a logic-high output if \nboth inputs are open, shorted or idle. \nBoth parts have power up/down mode, the glitch-free driver outputs permit live insertion or \nremoval of the transceiver into/from the data bus. The CMOS design offers significant power \nsavings without sacrificing ruggedness against overload or ESD damage. The typical quiescent \ncurrent is only 300μA during operation and 1μA in shutdown mode. \nThe UM3483E, UM3486E are intended for half-duplex communication and are available in SOP8 \nand DIP8 packages. \n \nApplications  \n Features  \n \n\uf06c Telecommunications \n\uf06c Low-Power RS-485 Transceivers \n\uf06c Integrated Services Digital Networks \n\uf06c Industrial-Control Local Area \nNetworks \n\uf06c Transceivers for EMI-Sensitive \nApplications \n\uf06c Packet Switching \n\uf06c Level Translators \n \uf06c ESD Protection for RS-485 I/O Pins \n±15kV—Human Body Model \n±15kV—IEC61000-4-2, Air-Gap Discharge \n±8kV—IEC61000-4-2, Contact Discharge \n\uf06c 3V to 5.5V Supply Voltage Range \n\uf06c Enhanced Slew-Rate Limiting Facilitates \nError-Free Data Transmission \n\uf06c 1μA Low-Current Shutdown Mode \n\uf06c -7V to +12V Common-Mode Input Voltage \nRange \n\uf06c Allows up to 256 Transceivers on the Bus \n\uf06c Thermal Shutdown \n\uf06c Current-Limiting for Driver Overload \nProtection  \n \n                           \n________________________________________________________________________ \nhttp://www.union-ic.com Rev.06 May.2020                                    2/18 \nUM3483E/UM3486E\n  \nOrdering Information \n \nPart Number Operating \nTemperature Mark Code Package Type Shipping Qty \nUM3483EESA  -40°C to +85°C UM3483EESA  SOP8 3000pcs/13 Inch  \nTape & Reel  \nUM3483EEPA  -40°C to +85°C UM3483EEPA  DIP8 50pcs/Tube \nUM3486EESA  -40°C to +85°C UM3486EESA  SOP8 3000pcs/13 Inch  \nTape & Reel  \nUM3486EEPA -40°C to +85°C UM3486EEPA DIP8 50pcs/Tube  \n \nSelection Guide \n \nPart \nNumber Guaranteed \nDate Rate \n(Mbps) Low-Power  \nShutdown  Slew-Rate  \nLimited Driver/ \nReceiver \nEnable Shutdown  \nCurrent \n(μA) Transceivers  \nOn Bus ±15kV \nESD \nProtection  \nUM3483E 0.5 Yes Yes Yes 1 256 Yes \nUM3486E 2.5 Yes Yes Yes 1 256 Yes \n \nPin Configurations          Top View \n  \n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5VCC RO\nDE\nDI GNDAB RE\n  \n \n \nXX: Week Code \nUM3483EESA \nSOP8  \n \n \nXX: Week Code \nUM3486EESA \nSOP8 \n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5VCC RO\nDE\nDI GNDAB RE\n  \n \n \nXX: Week Code \nUM3483EEPA \nDIP8  \n \n \nXX: Week Code \nUM3486EEPA \nDIP8 \n \n                           \n________________________________________________________________________ \nhttp://www.union-ic.com Rev.06 May.2020                                    3/18 \nUM3483E/UM3486E\n  \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings \n \nSymbol Parameter  Value Unit \nVCC Supply Voltage +7 V \n Control Input Voltage (/RE, DE) -0.3V to (V CC + 0.3V) V \n Driver Input Voltage (DI) -0.3V to (V CC + 0.3V) V \n Driver Output Voltage (A, B) -7 to +12 V \n Receiver Input Voltage (A, B) -7 to +12 V \n Receiver Output Voltage (RO) -0.3V to (V CC + 0.3V) V \nPD Continuous Power Dissipation at \nTA = 70°C  DIP8 727 mW SOP8 471 \nTA Ambient Temperature -40 to +85 °C \nTSTG Storage Temperature Range -65 to +160 °C \nTL Lead Temperature for Soldering 10 seconds +300 °C \n \nDC Electrical Characteristics   \n(VCC = +3V to 5.5V, T A = TMIN to TMAX, unless otherwise noted.

Typical Half-Duplex RS-485 Network \n \nDetail Description \n \nThe UM3483E, UM3486E are low-power transceivers for RS-485 communications. The \nUM3483E can transmit and receive at data rates up to 500kbps, and the UM3486E at up to \n2.5Mbps. The UM3483E, UM3486E are half-duplex. Driver Enable (DE) and Receiver Enable \n(RE______\n) pins are included on the UM3483E, UM3486E. When disabled, the driver and receiver \noutputs are high impedance. \n \nFail-Safe  \nThe UM3483E, UM3486E guarantees a logic-high receiver output when the receiver inputs are \nshorted or open, or when they are connected to a terminated transmission line with all drivers \ndisabled. This is done by setting the receiver threshold between -50mV and -200mV. If the \ndifferential receiver input voltage (A-B) is greater than or equal to -50mV, RO is logic high. If \nA-B is less than or equal to -200mV, RO is logic low. In the case of a terminated bus with all \ntransmitters disabled, the receiver’s differential input voltage is pulled to 0V by the termination. \nWith the receiver thresholds of the UM3483E, UM3486E, this results in a logic high with a 50mV \nminimum noise margin. Unlike previous fail-safe devices, the -50mV to -200mV threshold \ncomplies with the ±200mV EIA/TIA-485 standard. \n \n±15kV ESD Protection \nAs with all Union devices, ESD-protection structures are incorporated on all pins to protect \nagainst electrostatic discharges encountered during handling and assembly. The driver outputs and \nreceiver inputs of the UM3483E, UM3486E have extra protection against static electricity. \nUnion’s engineers have developed state-of-the-art structures to protect these pins against ESD of \n±15kV without damage. The ESD-protected pins are tested with reference to the ground pin in a \npower-down condition. They are tested to ±15kV using the Human Body Model. \n \nApplications Information \n \n256 Transceivers on the Bus \nThe standard RS-485 receiver input impedance is 12kΩ (one unit load), and the standard driver \ncan drive up to 32 unit loads. The Union family of transceivers have a 1/8 unit load receiver input \nimpedance (96kΩ), allowing up to 256 transceivers to be connected in parallel on one \ncommunication line. Any combination of these devices and/or other RS-485 transceivers with a \ntotal of 32 unit loads or less can be connected to the line. \n \n                           \n________________________________________________________________________ \nhttp://www.union-ic.com Rev.06 May.2020                                    15/18 \nUM3483E/UM3486E\n  \nReduced EMI and Reflections \nThe UM3483E, UM3486E are slew-rate-limited, minimizing EMI and reducing reflections caused \nby improperly terminated cables. In general, a transmitter’s rise time relates directly to the length \nof an unterminated stub, which can be driven with only minor waveform reflections. The \nfollowing equation expresses this relationship conservatively: \nLength=t RISE/(10×1.5ns/ft) \nWhere t RISE is the transmitter’s rise time. \nA system can work well with longer unterminated stubs, even with severe reflections, if the \nwaveform settles out before the UART samples them. \n \nLow-Power Shutdown Mode \nLow-power shutdown mode is initiated by bringing both RE______\n high and DE low. In shutdown, the \ndevice typically draws only 1μA of supply current. RE______\n and DE may be driven simultaneously; \nthe parts are guaranteed not to enter shutdown if RE______\n is high and DE is low for less than 50ns. If \nthe inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are guaranteed to enter shutdown. Enable \ntimes t PZH and tPZL in the Switching Characteristics tables assume the part was not in a low-power \nshutdown state. Enable times t PSH and t PSL assume the parts were shut down. It takes drivers and \nreceivers longer to become enabled from low-power shutdown mode (t PSH, tPSL) than from \ndriver/receiver-disable mode (t PZH, tPZL).  \nDriver Output Protection \nTwo mechanisms prevent excessive output current and power dissipation caused by faults or bus \ncontention. First, a foldback current limit on the output stage, provides immediate protection \nagainst short circuits over the whole common-mode voltage range. Second, a thermal shutdown \ncircuit, forces the driver outputs into a high-impedance state if the die temperature becomes \nexcessive. \n \nPropagation Delay \nSkew time is simply the difference between the low-to-high and high-to-low propagation delay. \nSmall driver/receiver skew times help maintain a symmetrical mark-space ratio (50% duty cycle). \nThe receiver skew time, |t RPLH - tRPHL|, is under 10ns (20ns for the UM3483E). The driver skew \ntimes 12ns for the UM3486E, and typically under 50ns for the UM3483E. \n \nTypical Applications \nThe UM3483E, UM3486E transceivers are designed for bidirectional data communications on \nmultipoint bus transmission lines. To minimize reflections, the line should be terminated at both \nends in its characteristic impedance, and stub lengths of the main line should be kept as short as \npossible. The slew-rate-limited UM3483E and the partially slew-rate-limited UM3486E are more \ntolerant of imperfect termination. \n                           \n________________________________________________________________________ \nhttp://www.union-ic.com Rev.06 May.2020                                    16/18 \nUM3483E/UM3486E\n  \nPackage Information  \n \nSOP8 \nOutline Drawing \nD\ne\n12\nTop View\n End View\nb\nSide Viewθc\n  \nDIMENSIONS \nSymbol MILLIMETERS INCHES \nMin Typ Max Min Typ Max \nA 1.35  1.55 1.75 0.053 0.061 0.069 \nA1 0.10  - 0.25  0.004 - 0.010  \nA2 1.25  - 1.65  0.049 - 0.065  \nb 0.30  - 0.51  0.012 - 0.020  \nc 0.15  - 0.25  0.006 - 0.010  \nD 4.70  4.90 5.10 0.185 0.193 0.200 \nE 3.80  3.90 4.00 0.150 0.154 0.157 \nE1 5.80  6.00 6.20 0.228 0.236 0.244 \ne 1.27BSC 0.050 BSC \nL 0.40  - 1.27  0.016 - 0.050  \nθ 0° - 8° 0° - 8° \n \nLand Pattern \n1.27\n0.60\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTES:  \n1.
