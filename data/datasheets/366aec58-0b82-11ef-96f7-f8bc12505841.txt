Application  \nThe LEDs described here are intended to be used for ordinary electronic equipment (such as office \nequipment, communication equipment and household applications).Consu lt Liteon’s Sales in advance \nfor information on applications in which  exceptional reliability is required, particularly when the failure \nor malfunction of the LEDs may directly jeopardize life or health (such as in aviation, transportation, \ntraffic control equipment, medical and life support systems and safety devices).   \n2. Storage  \nThe package is sealed:  \n  The LEDs should be stored at 30°C or less and 90%RH or less. And the LEDs are limited to use within  \none year, while the LEDs is packed in moisture -proof package with the desiccants inside.  \nThe package is opened:  \nThe stora ge ambient for the LEDs should not exceed 30°C temperature or 60% relative humidity.  \nIt is recommended that LEDs out of their original packaging are IR -reflowed within one week . \nFor extended storage out of their original packaging, it is recommended that t he LEDs be stored in a \nsealed container with appropriate desiccant, or in a desiccators with nitrogen ambient.  \nLEDs stored out of their original packaging for more than one week  should be baked at about 60 deg C \nfor at least 2 0 hours before solder assembl y.  \n3.
