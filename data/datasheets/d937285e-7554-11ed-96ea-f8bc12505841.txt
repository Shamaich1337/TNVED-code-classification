The AD9761 has been developed specifically for \nuse in wide bandwidth communication applications (e.g., spread \nspectrum) where digital I and Q information is being processed \nduring transmit operations. It integrates two 10-bit, 40 MSPS \nDACs, dual 2 \ue033 interpolation filters, a voltage reference, and digi -\ntal input interface circuitry. The AD9761 supports a 20 MSPS \nper channel input data rate that is then interpolated by 2 \ue033 up to \n40 MSPS before simultaneously updating each DAC.\nThe interleaved I and Q input data stream is presented to the \ndigital interface circuitry, which consists of I and Q latches as \nwell as some additional control logic. The data is de-interleaved \nback into its original I and Q data. An on-chip state machine \nensures the proper pairing of I and Q data. The data output from \neach latch is then processed by a 2 \ue033 digital interpolation filter \nthat eases the reconstruction filter requirements. The interpo -\nlated output of each filter serves as the input of their respective \n10-bit DAC.\nThe DACs utilize a segmented current source architecture com -\nbined with a proprietary switching technique to reduce glitch \nenergy and to maximize dynamic accuracy. Each DAC provides \ndifferential current output, thus supporting single-ended or dif -\nferential applications. Both DACs are simultaneously updated \nand provide a nominal full-scale current of 10 mA. Also, the \nfull-scale currents between each DAC are matched to within \n0.07 dB (i.e., 0.75%), thus eliminating the need for additional \ngain calibration circuitry.\nThe AD9761 is manufactured on an advanced low cost CMOS \nprocess. It operates from a single supply of 3 V to 5.5 V and \nconsumes 200 mW of power. To make the AD9761 complete, it \nalso offers an internal 1.20 V temperature-compensated band gap \nreference.PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. Dual 10-Bit, 40 MSPS DACs\n    A pair of high performance 40 MSPS DACs optimized for low \ndistortion performance provide for flexible transmission of I \nand Q information.\n2. 2\ue033 Digital Interpolation Filters\n    Dual matching FIR interpolation filters with 62.5 dB stop-\nband rejection precede each DAC input, thus reducing the \nDACs’ reconstruction filter requirements.\n3. Low Power\n   Complete CMOS dual DAC function operates on a low \n200 mW on a single supply from 3 V to 5.5 V. The DAC \nfull-scale current can be reduced for lower power opera -\ntion, and a sleep mode is provided for power reduction \nduring idle periods.\n4. On-Chip Voltage Reference\n    The AD9761 includes a 1.20 V temperature-compensated \nband gap voltage reference.\n5. Single 10-Bit Digital Input Bus\n    The AD9761 features a flexible digital interface that allows \neach DAC to be addressed in a variety of ways including dif -\nferent update rates.\n6. Small Package\n    The AD9761 offers the complete integrated function in a \ncompact 28-lead SSOP package.\n7. Product Family\n    The AD9761 Dual Transmit DAC has a pair of Dual Receive \nADC companion products, the AD9281 (8 bits) and AD9201 \n(10 bits).\nREV.

For IOUTA, 0 mA output is expected when \nthe inputs are all 0s. For IOUTB, 0 mA output is expected when \nall inputs are set to 1s.\nGain Error\nThe difference between the actual and ideal output span. The \nactual span is determined by the output when all inputs are set to \n1s minus the output when all inputs are set to 0s.\nOutput Compliance Range\nThe range of allowable voltage at the output of a current-output \nDAC. Operation beyond the maximum compliance limits may \ncause either output stage saturation or breakdown, resulting in \nnonlinear performance.\nTemperature Drift\nTemperature drift is specified as the maximum change from the \nambient (25°C) value to the value at either T MIN or T MAX. For \noffset and gain drift, the drift is reported in ppm of full-scale \nrange (FSR) per °C. For reference drift, the drift is reported in \nppm per °C.\nPower Supply Rejection\nThe maximum change in the full-scale output as the supplies \nare varied from nominal to minimum and maximum specified \nvoltages.\nSettling Time\nThe time required for the output to reach and remain within a \nspecified error band about its final value, measured from the start \nof the output transition.\nGlitch Impulse\nAsymmetrical switching times in a DAC give rise to undesired \noutput transients that are quantified by a glitch impulse. It is \nspecified as the net area of the glitch in pV-s.Channel Isolation\nChannel Isolation is a measure of the level of crosstalk between \nchannels. It is measured by producing a full-scale 8 MHz signal \noutput for one channel and measuring the leakage into the other \nchannel.\nSpurious-Free Dynamic Range\nThe difference, in dB, between the rms amplitude of the output \nsignal and the peak spurious signal over the specified bandwidth.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nTHD is the ratio of the sum of the rms value of the first six \nharmonic components to the rms value of the measured output \nsignal. It is expressed as a percentage or in decibels (dB).\nSignal-to-Noise and Distortion (S/N+D, SINAD) Ratio\nS/N+D is the ratio of the rms value of the measured output \nsignal to the rms sum of all other spectral components below the \nNyquist frequency, including harmonics but excluding dc. The \nvalue for S/N+D is expressed in decibels.\nEffective Number of Bits (ENOB)\nFor a sine wave, SINAD can be expressed in terms of the number \nof bits. Using the following formula,\nN = (SINAD  – 1.76)/6.02\nit is possible to get a measure of performance expressed as N, the \neffective number of bits.\nThus, effective number of bits for a device for sine wave inputs \nat a given input frequency can be calculated directly from its \nmeasured SINAD.\nPass Band\nFrequency band in which any input applied therein \npasses unattenuated to the DAC output.\nStop-Band Rejection\nThe amount of attenuation of a frequency outside the pass band \napplied to the DAC, relative to a full-scale signal applied at the \nDAC input within the pass band.\nGroup Delay\nNumber of input clocks between an impulse applied at \nthe device input and peak DAC output current.\nImpulse Response\nResponse of the device to an impulse applied to the input.\nREV.

The \nAD9761 is a complete dual-channel, high speed, 10-bit CMOS \nDAC capable of operating up to a 40 MHz clock rate. It has \nbeen optimized for the transmit section of wideband communica -\ntion systems employing I and Q modulation schemes. Excellent \nmatching characteristics between channels reduce the need for \nany external calibration circuitry. Dual matching 2 \ue033 interpola -\ntion filters included in the I and Q data path simplify any post \nband-limiting filter requirements.

Dual DAC Functional Block Diagram\nReferring to Figure 4, the AD9761 consists of an analog sec -\ntion and a digital section. The analog section includes matched \nI and Q 10-bit DACs, a 1.20 V band gap voltage reference, and \na reference control amplifier. The digital section includes two 2 \ue033 \ninterpolation filters, segment decoding logic, and some additional \ndigital input interface circuitry. The analog and digital sections of \nthe AD9761 have separate power supply inputs (i.e., AVDD and \nDVDD) that can operate independently. The digital supply can \noperate over a 2.7 V to 5.5 V range, allowing it to accommodate \nTTL as well as 3.3 V and 5 V CMOS logic families. The analog \nsupply must be restricted from 3.0 V to 5.5 V to maintain opti -\nmum performance.Each DAC consists of a large PMOS current source array capable \nof providing up to 10 mA of full-scale current, I OUTFS . Each array is \ndivided into 15 equal currents that make up the four most signifi -\ncant bits (MSBs). The next four bits or middle bits consist of 15 \nequal current sources whose values are 1/16 of an MSB current \nsource. The remaining LSBs are binary weighted fractions of \nthe middle bits’ current sources. All of these current sources are \nswitched to one of two output nodes (i.e., IOUTA or IOUTB) \nvia PMOS differential current switches.\nThe full-scale output current, I OUTFS , of each DAC is regulated \nfrom the same voltage reference and control amplifier, thus \nensuring excellent gain matching and drift characteristics \nbetween DACs. I OUTFS  can be set from 1 mA to 10 mA via an \nexternal resistor, R SET. The external resistor in combination \nwith both the reference control amplifier and voltage reference, \nVREFIO, sets the reference current, I REF, which is mirrored over \nto the segmented current sources with the proper scaling factor. \nIOUTFS  is exactly 16 times the value of I REF.\nThe I and Q DACs are simultaneously updated on the rising \nedge of CLOCK with digital data from their respective 2 \ue033 \ndigital interpolation filters. The 2 \ue033 interpolation filters essen -\ntially multiply the input data rate of each DAC by a factor of \n2, relative to its original input data rate, while simultaneously \nreducing the magnitude of the first image associated with the \nDAC’s original input data rate. Since the AD9761 supports a \nsingle 10-bit digital bus with interleaved I and Q input data, the \noriginal I and Q input data rate before interpolation is one-half \nthe CLOCK rate. After interpolation, the data rate into each I \nand Q DAC becomes equal to the CLOCK rate.\nThe benefits of an interpolation filter are illustrated in Figure 5, \nwhich shows an example of the frequency and time domain rep -\nresentation of a discrete time sine wave signal before and after \nit is applied to a digital interpolation filter. Images of the sine \nwave signal appear around multiples of the DAC’s input data \nrate as predicted by the sampling theory. These undesirable \nimages will also appear at the output of a reconstruction DAC, \nalthough modified by the DAC’s sin(x)/(x) response. In many \nband-limited applications, these images must be suppressed by \nan analog filter following the DAC.

Time and Frequency Domain Example of Digital Interpolation Filter\nREV. C REV. C\nAD9761\n–10–AD9761\n–11–log filter is typically determined by the proximity of the desired \nfundamental to the first image and the required amount of image \nsuppression.\nReferring to Figure 5, the “new” first image associated with the \nDAC’s higher data rate after interpolation is “pushed” out fur -\nther relative to the input signal. The “old” first image associated \nwith the lower DAC data rate before  interpolation is suppressed \nby the digital filter. As a result, the transition band for the analog \nreconstruction filter is increased, thus reducing the complexity \nof the analog filter.\nThe digital interpolation filters for I and Q paths are identi -\ncal 43-tap half-band symmetric FIR filters. Each filter receives \nde-interleaved I or Q data from the digital input interface. The \ninput CLOCK signal is internally divided by 2 to generate the \nfilter clock. The filters are implemented with two parallel paths \nrunning at the filter clock rate. The output from each path is \nselected on opposite phases of the filter clock, thus producing \ninterpolated filtered output data at the input clock rate. The \nfrequency response and impulse response of these filters are \nshown in Figures 2a and 2b. Table I lists the idealized filter \ncoefficients that correspond to the filter’s impulse response.\nThe digital section of the AD9761 also includes an input interface \nsection designed to support interleaved I and Q input data from \na single 10-bit bus. This section de-interleaves the I and Q input \ndata while ensuring its proper pairing for the 2 \ue033 interpolation \nfilters. A RESET/SLEEP input serves a dual function by providing \na reset function for this section as well as providing power-down \nfunctionality. Refer to the Digital Inputs and Interleaved Interface \nConsiderations and RESET/SLEEP Mode Operation sections for \na more detailed discussion.\nDAC TRANSFER FUNCTION\nEach I and Q DAC provides complementary current output \npins: IOUT(A/B) and QOUT(A/B), respectively. Note that \nQOUTA and QOUTB operate identically to IOUTA and \nIOUTB. IOUTA will provide a near full-scale current output, \nIOUTFS , when all bits are high (i.e., DAC CODE = 1023), while \nIOUTB, the complementary output, provides no current. The \ncurrent outputs of IOUTA and IOUTB are a function of both \nthe input code and I OUTFS  and can be expressed as\nI DAC CODE / IOUTA OUTFS =( )× 1024                            (1)\nI –DAC CODE IOUTB OUTFS =( )× 1023 1024/                        (2)\nwhere:\nDAC CODE  = 0 to 1023 (i.e., decimal representation).\nAs previously mentioned, IOUTFS  is a function of the reference \ncurrent, IREF, which is nominally set by a reference, VREFIO, and \nexternal resistor, RSET. It can be expressed as\nI IOUTFS REF= ×16                                                           (3)\nwhere:\nI V RREF REFIO SET = /                                                      (4)\nThe two current outputs will typically drive a resistive load \ndirectly or via a transformer. If dc coupling is required, IOUTA \nand IOUTB should be directly connected to matching resistive \nloads, R LOAD, which are tied to analog common, ACOM. Note \nthat RLOAD represents the equivalent load resistance seen by IOUTA or IOUTB. The single-ended voltage output appearing \nat IOUTA and IOUTB pins is simply\nV I RIOUTA OUTA LOAD = ×                                                   (5)\nV I RIOUTB OUTB LOAD = ×                                                   (6)\nNote that the full-scale value of VIOUTA and VIOUTB should not \nexceed the specified output compliance range to maintain speci -\nfied distortion and linearity performance.\nThe differential voltage, VIDIFF, appearing across IOUTA and \nIOUTB is\nV I I RIDIFF IOUTA IOUTB LOAD =( )× –                                  (7)\nSubstituting the values of IIOUTA, IIOUTB, and IREF, VIDIFF can be \nexpressed as\nV DAC CODE –\nR R VIDIFF\nLOAD SET REFIO=( )) { }×\n( )×2 10231024\n16/\n/                        (8)\nThese last two equations highlight some of the advantages of \noperating the AD9761 differentially. First, differential opera -\ntion will help cancel common-mode error sources associated \nwith I IOUTA  and I IOUTB , such as noise and distortion. Second, \nthe differential code-dependent current and subsequent volt -\nage, V IDIFF, is twice the value of the single-ended voltage output \n(i.e., V IOUTA  or V IOUTB ), thus providing twice the signal power to \nthe load.\nREFERENCE OPERATION\nThe AD9761 contains an internal 1.20 V band gap reference that \ncan be easily disabled and overridden by an external reference. \nREFIO serves as either an input or output  depending on whether \nthe internal or an external reference is selected. If REFLO is tied \nto ACOM as shown in Figure  6, the internal reference is activated \nand REFIO provides a 1.20  V output. In this case, the internal ref -\nerence must be filtered externally with a ceramic chip capacitor of \n0.1 µF or greater from REFIO to REFLO. Also, REFIO should be \nbuffered with an external amplifier having a low input bias current \n(i.e., <1 µA) if any additional loading is required.\n50pF\nCURRENT\nSOURCE\nARRAY+1.2V REF\nREFI O\nFSADJREFLO COMP2 AVDD0.1\ue06dF\nRSET\n2k\ue0560.1\ue06dFOPTIONAL EXTERNAL\nREF BUFFER FOR\nADDITIONAL LOADS\nCOMPENSATION\nCAPACITOR\nREQUIRE DAD9761\nFigure 6. Internal Reference Configuration\nThe internal reference can also be disabled by connecting \nREFLO to AVDD. In this case, an external reference may then \nbe applied to REFIO as shown in Figure 7. The external reference \nmay provide either a fixed reference voltage to enhance accura -\ncy and drift performance or a varying reference voltage for gain \ncontrol. Note that the 0.1 µF compensation capacitor is not \nrequired since the internal reference is disabled and the high \ninput impedance (i.e., 1 M \ue056) of REFIO minimizes any loading \nof the external reference .\nREV.

External Reference Configuration\nREFERENCE CONTROL AMPLIFIER\nThe AD9761 also contains an internal control amplifier that is \nused to simultaneously regulate both DACs’ full-scale out put \ncurrent, I OUTFS . Since the I and Q I OUTFS  are derived from \nthe same voltage reference and control circuitry, ex cellent \ngain matching is ensured. The control amplifier is configured \nas a V-I converter as shown in Figure  7 such that its current \noutput, I REF, is determined by the ratio of the V REFIO and an \nexternal resistor, R SET, as stated in Equation  4. I REF is cop ied \nover to the segmented current sources with the proper scal ing \nfactor to set I OUTFS  as stated in Equation  3.\nThe control amplifier allows a wide (10:1) adjustment span \nof I OUTFS  over a 1 mA to 10 mA range by setting I REF between \n62.5 µA and 625 µA. The wide adjustment span of I OUTFS  \nprovides several application benefits. The first benefit relates \ndirectly to the power dissipation of the AD9761’s analog \nsupply, AVDD, which is proportional to I OUTFS  (refer to the \nPower Dissipation section). The second benefit relates to the \n20 dB adjustment span, which may be useful for sys tem gain \ncontrol purposes.\nOptimum noise and dynamic performance for the AD9761 is \nobtained with a 0.1 µF external capacitor installed be tween \nCOMP2 and AVDD. The bandwidth of the reference control \namplifier is limited to approximately 5  kHz with a 0.1  µF \ncapacitor installed. Since the –3  dB bandwidth corresponds \nto the dominant pole and therefore its dominant time con -\nstant, the settling time of the control amplifier to a stepped \nreference input response can be easily determined. Note that \nthe output of the control amplifier, COMP2, is internally \ncompensated via a 50 pF capacitor, thus ensuring its stabil -\nity if no external capacitor is added.Depending on the requirements of the application, I REF \ncan be adjusted by varying either R SET, or, in the external \nreference mode, by varying the REFIO voltage. I REF can be \nvaried for a fixed R SET by disabling the internal reference and \nvarying the voltage of REFIO over its compliance range of \n1.25 V to 0.10 V. REFIO can be driven by a single-supply \namplifier or DAC, thus allowing I REF to be varied for a fixed \nRSET. Since the input impedance of REFIO is approximately \n1 M\ue056, a simple, low cost R-2R ladder DAC configured in \nthe voltage mode topology may be used to control the gain. \nThis circuit is shown in Figure 8 using the AD7524 and an \nexternal 1.2 V reference, the AD1580.\nANALOG OUTPUTS\nAs previously stated, both the I and Q DACs produce two \ncomplementary current outputs that may be configured for \nsingle-ended or differential operation. I IOUTA  and I IOUTB  can be \nconverted into complementary single-ended voltage outputs, \nVIOUTA  and V IOUTB , via a load resistor, R LOAD, as described in \nthe DAC Transfer Function section by Equations 5 through \n8. The differential voltage, V IDIFF, existing between V IOUTA  \nand V IOUTB , can also be converted to a single-ended voltage \nvia a transformer or differential amplifier configuration.\nFigure 9 shows an equivalent circuit of the AD9761’s I (or Q) \nDAC output. It consists of a parallel array of PMOS current \nsources in which each current source is switched to either \nIOUTA or IOUTB via a differential PMOS switch.

It degrades slightly from \nits nominal 1.25 V for an I OUTFS  = 10 mA to 1.00 V for an \nIOUTFS  = 2 mA. Applications requiring the AD9761’s output \n(i.e., V OUTA and/or V OUTB) to extend to its output compliance \nrange should size R LOAD accordingly. Operation beyond this \ncompliance range will adversely affect the AD9761’s linear ity \nperformance and subsequently degrade its distortion per for-\nmance. Note that the optimum distortion performance of \nthe AD9761 is obtained by restricting its output(s) as seen at \nIOUT(A/B) and QOUT(A/B) to within ±0.5 V.\nDIGITAL INPUTS AND INTERLEAVED INTERFACE \nCONSIDERATIONS\nThe AD9761 digital interface consists of 10 data input pins, \na clock input pin, and three control pins. It is designed to \nsupport a clock rate up to 40 MSPS. The 10-bit parallel \ndata inputs follow standard positive binary coding, where \nDB9 is the most significant bit (MSB) and DB0 is the \nleast sig nificant bit (LSB). IOUTA (or QOUTA) produces \na full-scale out put current when all data bits are at Logic 1. \nIOUTB (or QOUTB) produces a complementary output, \nwith the full-scale current split between the two outputs as a \nfunction of the input code.\nSTATE\nMACHINEI AND Q DATA\nCLOCK\nSELECT\nRESET/SLEEP\nWRITEQ DATA\nCLOCK\n2I DATAI\nINPUT\nREGISTERI\nFILTER\nREGISTER\nQ\nINPUT\nREGISTERQ\nINPUT\nREGISTER\nFigure 10. Block Diagram of Digital Interface\nThe AD9761 interfaces with a single 10-bit digital input \nbus that supports interleaved I and Q input data. Figure 10 \nshows a simplified block diagram of the digital interface \ncircuitry consisting of two banks of edge triggered registers, \ntwo multiplexers, and a state machine. Interleaved I and Q \ninput data is presented at the DATA input bus, where it is \nthen latched into the selected I or Q input register on the \nrising edge of the WRITE input. The output of these input \nregisters is transferred in pairs to their respective interpola -\ntor filters’ register after each Q write on the rising edge of \nthe CLOCK input (refer to Timing Diagram in Figure 1). \nA state machine ensures the proper pairing of I and Q in put \ndata to the interpolation filter’s inputs.\nThe SELECT signal at the time of the rising edge of the \nWRITE signal determines which input register latches \nthe input data. If SELECT is high around the rising \nedge of WRITE, the data is latched into the I register of the AD9761. If SELECT is low around the rising edge \nof WRITE, the data is latched into the Q register of the \nAD9761. If SELECT is kept in one state while data is \nrepeatedly writing to the AD9761, the data will be written \ninto the selected filter register at half the input data rate \nsince the data is always assumed to be interleaved.\nThe state machine controls the generation of the divided \nclock and thus pairing of I and Q data inputs. After the \nAD9761 is reset, the state machine keeps track of the paired \nI and Q data. The state transition diagram is shown in Fig -\nure 11, in which all states are defined. A transition in state \noccurs upon the rising edge of CLOCK and is a function \nof the current state as well as status of SELECT, WRITE, \nand SLEEP. The state machine is reset on the first rising \nCLOCK edge while RESET remains high. Upon RESET \nreturning low, a state transition will occur on the first rising \nedge of CLOCK. The most recent I and Q data samples \nare transferred to the correct interpolation filter only upon \nentering state FILTER DATA.\nNote that it is possible to ensure proper pairing of I and Q data \ninputs without issuing RESET high. This may be accomplished \nby writing two or more successive Q data inputs followed by \na clock. In this case, the state machine will ad vance to either \nthe RESET or FILTER DATA state.

State Transition Diagram of AD9761 \nDigital Interface\nAn example helps illustrate the digital timing and control \nrequirements to ensure proper pairing of I and Q data. In \nthis example, the AD9761 is assumed to interface with a host \nprocessor on a dedicated data bus and the state machine \nis reset by asserting a Logic Level 1 to the RESET/SLEEP \ninput for a duration of one clock cycle. In the timing dia gram \nshown in Figure 12, WRITE and CLOCK are tied together \nwhile SELECT is updated at the same instance as DATA. \nSince SELECT is high upon RESET returning low, I data is \nlatched into the I input register on the first rising WRITE. \nOn the next rising WRITE edge, the Q data is latched into \nits input register and the outputs of both input registers are \nlatched into their respective I and Q filter registers. The \nsequence of events is repeated on the next rising WRITE edge \nwith the new I data being latched into the I input register.\nThe digital inputs are CMOS compatible with logic thresholds, \nVTHRESHOLD , set to approximately half the digital positive \nsupply (DVDD) or VTHRESHOLD = DVDD /2 (±20%).\nThe internal digital circuitry of the AD9761 is capable of \noperating over a digital supply range of 2.7 V to 5.5 V. As a \nREV. C REV. C\nAD9761\n–14–AD9761\n–15–result, the digital inputs can also accommodate TTL levels \nwhen DVDD is set to accommodate the maximum high \nlevel voltage, V OH(MAX) , of the TTL drivers. A DVDD of 3 V \nto 3.3 V will typically ensure proper compatibility of most \nTTL logic families.

Equivalent Digital Input\nSince the AD9761 is capable of being updated up to 40 MSPS, \nthe quality of the clock and data input signals are important \nin achieving the optimum performance. The drivers of the \ndigital data interface circuitry should be specified to meet \nthe minimum setup and hold times of the AD9761 as well \nas its required min/max input logic level thresholds. The \nexternal clock driver circuitry should provide the AD9761 \nwith a low jitter clock input meeting the min/max logic \nlevels while providing fast edges. Fast clock edges will help \nminimize any jitter that can manifest itself as phase noise \non a reconstructed waveform.\nDigital signal paths should be kept short, and run lengths \nmatched to avoid propagation delay mismatch. The inser -\ntion of a low value resistor network (i.e., 20 \ue056 to 100 \ue056) \nbetween the AD9761 digital inputs and driver outputs \nmay be helpful in reducing any overshooting and ringing at \nthe digital inputs, which contributes to data feedthrough. \nOperating the AD9761 with reduced logic swings and a \ncorresponding digital supply (DVDD) will also reduce data \nfeedthrough.\nRESET/SLEEP MODE OPERATION\nThe RESET/SLEEP input can be used either to power down \nthe AD9761 or reset its internal digital interface logic. If the \nRESET/SLEEP input is asserted for greater than one clock \ncycle but under four clock cycles by applying a Logic 1, the \ninternal state machine will be reset. If the RESET/SLEEP input \nis asserted for four clock cycles or longer, the power-down func -\ntion of the AD9761 will be initiated. The power-down function \nturns off the output current and reduces the supply current to \nless than 9 mA over the specified supply range of 3 V to 5.5 V \nand temperature range .The power-up and power-down characteristics of the AD9761 \nare dependent upon the value of the compensation \ncapacitor connected to COMP1 and COMP3. With a \nnominal value of 0.1 µF, the AD9761 takes less than 5  µs to \npower down and approximately 3.25  ms to power back up.\nPOWER DISSIPATION\nThe power dissipation of the AD9761 is dependent on several \nfactors, including \n1. AVDD and DVDD, the power supply voltages.\n2. I OUTFS , the full-scale current output.\n3. f CLOCK , the update rate.\n4.

Unless otherwise noted, it is assumed \nthat I OUTFS  is set to a nominal 10  mA. For applications requir -\ning the optimum dynamic performance, a differential output \nconfiguration is suggested. A differential output configuration \nmay consist of either an RF transformer or a differential op amp \nconfiguration. The transformer configuration provides the \noptimum high frequency performance and is recommended \nfor any application allowing for ac coupling. The differential \nop amp configuration is suitable for applications requiring dc \ncoupling, a bipolar output, signal gain, and/or level shifting.\nA single-ended output is suitable for applications requiring \na unipolar voltage output. A positive unipolar output volt age \nwill result if IOUTA and/or IOUTB is connected to an \nappropriately sized load resistor, R LOAD, referred to ACOM. \nThis configuration may be more suitable for a single-sup ply \nsystem requiring a dc-coupled, ground referred output volt -\nage. Alternatively, an amplifier could be configured as an I-V \nconverter, thus converting I OUTA or I OUTB into a negative \nunipolar voltage. This configuration provides the best dc \nlinearity since IOUTA or IOUTB is maintained at a virtual \nground.\nDifferential Coupling Using a Transformer\nAn RF transformer can be used to perform a differential-\nto-single-ended signal conversion as shown in Figure 17. A \ndifferentially coupled transformer output provides the op timum \ndistortion performance for output signals whose spectral \ncontent lies within the transformer’s pass band. An RF \ntransformer such as the Mini-Circuits T1-1T provides \nexcellent rejection of common-mode distortion (i.e., even-or der \nharmonics) and noise over a wide frequency range. It also \nprovides electrical isolation and the ability to deliver twice \nthe power to the load. Transformers with different imped ance \nratios may also be used for impedance matching purposes. \nNote that the transformer provides ac coupling only.OPTIONAL\nRDIFFRLOADMINI-CIRCUITS\nT1-1T\nIOUTA\nIOUTBAD9761\nFigure 17 . Differential Output Using a Transformer\nThe center tap on the primary side of the transformer must \nbe connected to ACOM to provide the necessary dc cur rent \npath for both I OUTA and I OUTB. The complementary voltages \nappearing at IOUTA and IOUTB (i.e., V OUTA and V OUTB) \nswing symmetrically around ACOM and should be main tained \nwith the specified output compliance range of the AD9761. \nA differential resistor, R DIFF, may be inserted in applica tions \nin which the output of the transformer is connected to the \nload, R LOAD, via a passive reconstruction filter or cable \nrequiring double termination. R DIFF is determined by the \ntransformer’s impedance ratio and provides the proper \nsource termination, which results in a low VSWR. Note \nthat approximately half the signal power will be dissipated \nacross R DIFF.\nDifferential Coupling Using an Op Amp\nAn op amp can also be used to perform a differential \nto single-ended conversion as shown in Figure 18. The \nAD9761 is configured with two equal load resistors, R LOAD, \nof 50 \ue056. The differential voltage developed across IOUTA \nand IOUTB is converted to a single-ended signal via the \ndifferential op amp configuration. An optional capacitor \ncan be installed across IOUTA and IOUTB forming a real \npole in a low-pass filter. The addition of this capacitor also \nenhances the op amp’s distortion performance by prevent -\ning the DAC’s high slewing output from overloading the op \namp’s input.\nCOPT200\ue056\n500\ue056IOUTA\nIOUTBAD9761\nRLOAD\n50\ue056200\ue056\nAD8042500\ue056\nRLOAD\n50\ue056\nFigure 18. DC Differential Coupling Using an Op Amp\nThe common-mode rejection of this configuration is typi cally \ndetermined by the resistor matching. In this circuit, the \ndifferential op amp circuit using the AD8042 is configured \nto provide some additional signal gain. The op amp must \noperate from a dual supply since its output is approxi mately \n±1.0 V. A high speed amplifier capable of preserving the \ndifferential performance of the AD9761 while meeting other \nsystem level objectives (i.e., cost, power) should be select ed. \nThe op amp’s differential gain, gain setting resistor val ues, \nand full-scale output swing capabilities should all be con sid-\nered when optimizing this circuit.\nREV.

In this \ncase, AVDD, which is the positive analog supply for both the \nAD9761 and the op amp, is also used to level-shift the differ -\nential output of the AD9761 to midsupply (i.e., AVDD/2) .\nCOPT200\ue056\n1k\ue056IOUTA\nIOUTBAD9761\nRLOAD\n50\ue056200\ue056\nAD8042500\ue056\nRLOAD\n50\ue0561k\ue056\nAVDD\nFigure 19.

In the case of a doubly terminated low-pass \nfilter, R LOAD represents the equivalent load resistance seen by \nIOUTA or IOUTB. The unused output (IOUTA or IOUTB) \ncan be connected to ACOM directly or via a matching R LOAD. \nDifferent values of I OUTFS  and R LOAD can be selected as long \nas the positive compliance range is adhered to.\n50\ue056IOUTA\nIOUTBAD9761\n50\ue056IOUTFS  = 10m A\nVOUT =\n 0V TO 0.5V\nFigure 20. 0 V to 0.5 V Unbuffered Voltage Output\nDifferential, DC-Coupled Output Configuration with \nLevel Shifting\nSome applications may require the AD9761 differential outputs \nto interface to a single-supply quadrature upconverter. \nAlthough most of these devices provide differential inputs, \nits common-mode voltage range does not typically extend \nto ground. As a result, the ground-referenced output sig nals \nshown in Figure 20 must be level shifted to within the \nspecified common-mode range of the single-supply quadra ture \nupconverter. Figure 21 shows the addition of a resistor pull- up \nnetwork that provides the level shifting function. The use \nof matched resistor networks will maintain maximum gain \nmatching and minimum offset performance between the \nI and Q channels.

Differential, DC-Coupled Output \nConfiguration with Level-Shifting\nPOWER AND GROUNDING CONSIDERATIONS\nIn systems seeking to simultaneously achieve high speed and \nhigh performance, the implementation and construction of \nthe printed circuit board design is often as important as the \ncircuit design. Proper RF techniques must be used in device \nselection, placement and routing, and supply bypass ing and \ngrounding. The evaluation board for the AD9761, which \nuses a 4-layer PC board, serves as a good example for the \npreviously mentioned considerations. The evaluation board \nprovides an illustration of the recommended printed circuit \nboard ground, power, and signal plane layout.\nProper grounding and decoupling should be a primary objec -\ntive in any high speed, high resolution system. The AD9761 \nfeatures separate analog and digital supply and ground pins \nto optimize the management of analog and digital ground \ncurrents in a system. In general, AVDD, the analog supply, \nshould be decoupled to ACOM, the analog common, as \nclose to the chip as physically possible. Similarly, DVDD, \nthe digital supply should be decoupled as close to DCOM as \nphysically as possible.\nFor those applications requiring a single 5 V or 3.3 V supply \nfor both the analog and digital supply, a clean analog sup ply \nmay be generated using the circuit shown in Figure 22. \nThe circuit consists of a differential LC filter with separate \npower supply and return lines. Lower noise can be attained \nusing low ESR type electrolytic and tantalum capacitors.\n0.1\ue06dF\nCER.10\ue06dF–22\ue06dF\nTANT.100\ue06dF\nELECT.AVDD\nACOM+ +\n– –FERRIT E\nBEADS\n5V OR 3V POWE R\nSUPPLYTTL/CMO S\nLOGIC\nCIRCUIT S\nFigure 22.

C\nAD9761\n–16–AD9761\n–17–Maintaining low noise on power supplies and ground is critical \nto obtaining optimum results from the AD9761. If properly \nimplemented, ground planes can perform a host of func tions \non high speed circuit boards such as bypassing, shielding, \ncurrent transport. In mixed signal design, the analog and \ndigital portions of the board should be distinct from each \nother, with the analog ground plane confined to the areas \ncover ing the analog signal traces and the digital ground plane \nconfined to areas covering the digital interconnects.\nAll analog ground pins of the DAC, reference, and other \nanalog components should be tied directly to the analog \nground plane. The two ground planes should be connected \nby a path 1/8 to 1/4 inch wide underneath, or within 1/2 inch \nof the DAC to maintain optimum performance. Care should \nbe taken to ensure that the ground plane is uninterrupted \nover crucial signal paths. On the digital side, this includes the \ndigital input lines running to the DAC as well as any clock \nsignals. On the analog side, this includes the DAC output \nsignal, reference signal, and the supply feeders.\nThe use of wide runs or planes in the routing of power lines \nis also recommended. This serves the dual role of provid ing \na low series impedance power supply to the part, as well as \nproviding some free capacitive decoupling to the appropri -\nate ground plane. It is essential that care be taken in the \nlayout of signal and power ground interconnects to avoid \ninduc ing extraneous voltage drops in the signal ground \npaths. It is recommended that all connections be short, di rect, \nand as physically close to the package as possible in order \nto minimize the sharing of conduction paths between dif fer-\nent currents. When runs exceed an inch in length, strip line \ntechniques with a proper termination resistor should be \nconsidered. The necessity and value of this resistor will be \ndependent upon the logic family used.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the implementation and \nconstruction of high speed, mixed signal printed circuit \nboards, refer to Analog Devices’ Application Notes AN-280 \nand AN-333.\nAPPLICATIONS\nUsing the AD9761 for QAM Modulation\nQAM is one of the most widely used digital modulation \nschemes in digital communication systems. This modula tion \ntechnique can be found in both FDM as well as spread \nspectrum (i.e., CDMA) based systems. A QAM signal is a \ncarrier frequency that is modulated both in amplitude (i.e., \nAM modulation) and in phase (i.e., PM modulation). It can \nbe generated by independently modulating two carriers of \nidentical frequency but with a 90° phase difference. This re sults \nin an in-phase (I) carrier component and a quadrature (Q) \ncarrier component at a 90° phase shift with respect to the \nI component. The I and Q components are then summed to \nprovide a QAM signal at the specified carrier frequency.A common and traditional implementation of a QAM \nmodulator is shown in Figure 23. The modulation is per formed \nin the analog domain in which two DACs are used to gen -\nerate the baseband I and Q components, respectively. Each \ncomponent is then typically applied to a Nyquist filter \nbefore being applied to a quadrature mixer. The matching \nNyquist filter shapes and limits each component’s spectral \nenvelope while minimizing intersymbol interference. The \nDAC is typically updated at the QAM symbol rate or pos sibly \na multiple of it if an interpolating filter precedes the DAC. \nThe use of an interpolating filter typically eases the imple -\nmentation and complexity of the analog filter, which can be \na significant contributor to mismatches in gain and phase \nbetween the two baseband channels. A quadrature mixer \nmodulates the I and Q components with in-phase and \nquadrature phase carrier frequency and then sums the two \noutputs to provide the QAM signal.\nS0\n90CARRIER\nFREQ\nNYQUIST\nFILTERSQUADRATURE\nMODULATORTO\nMIXERIOUT\nQOUTAD976110DSP\nOR\nASIC\nFigure 23.

Careful attention to layout \nand circuit design along with prototyping area allows the \nuser to easily and effectively evaluate the AD9761. This \nboard allows the user the flexibility to operate each of the \nAD9761 DACs in a single-ended or differential output \nconfiguration. Each of the DACs’ single-ended outputs are \nterminated in a 50 \ue056 resistor. Evaluation using a transform er \ncoupled output can be accomplished simply by installing \na Mini-Circuits transformer (i.e., Model T2-1T) into the \navailable socket.\nThe digital inputs are designed to be driven directly from \nvarious word generators with the on-board option to add \na resistor network for proper load termination. Separate \n50 \ue056 terminated SMA connectors are also provided for the \nCLOCK, WRITE, and SELECT inputs.
