B | Page 10 of 16 TERMINOLOGY  \nRelative Accuracy  \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity (INL) is \na measure of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a straight \nline passing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer function.  \nA typical INL vs. code plot is shown  in Figure 5. \nDifferential Nonlinearity  \nDifferential nonlinearity (DNL) is the difference between the \nmeasured change and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two \nadjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ± 1 LSB \nmaximum ensures monotonicit y. This DAC is guaranteed mono -\ntonic by design. A typical DNL vs. code plot is shown  in Figure 6. \nZero  Code Error  \nZero  code error is a measure of the output error when zero code \n(000 hex) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally , the output should  \nbe 0 V . The zero  code error is always positive in the AD5310 \nbecause the output of the DAC cannot go below 0 V . It is due to a combination of the offset errors in the DAC and output amplifier. Zero  code error is expressed in mV .  A plot o f zero  code error vs. \ntemperature is shown  in Figure 9. \nFull -Scale Error  \nFull-scale error is a measure of the output error when full -scale \ncode (3FF Hex) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally , the output  \nshould be V\nDD − 1 LSB. Full -scale error i s expressed as a  percent age \nof the full-scale range. A pl ot of full -scale error vs. temperature \nis shown  in Figure 9. Gain Error  \nGain error is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the \ndeviation in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from the \nideal expressed as a percent age of the full -scale range.  \nTotal Unadjusted Error  \nTotal unadjusted error (TUE) is a measure of the output error \nthat takes all the various errors into account. A typical TUE vs. \ncode plot is shown  in Figure 7. \nZero  Code Error Drift  \nZero code error drift  is a measure of the ch ange in zero  code \nerror with a change in temperature. It is expressed in µ V/°C.  \nGain Error Drift  \nGain error drift  is a measure of the change in gain error with \nchanges in temperature. It is expressed in (ppm of full -scale \nrange)/ °C. \nDigital -to-Analog Glitc h Impulse  \nDigital -to-analog glitch impulse is the impulse injected into the \nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes state. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in nV -s and \nis measured when the digital input code is chang ed by 1  LSB at \nthe major carry transition (1FF hex to 200 hex ). See Figure 22. \nDigital Feedthrough  \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into the  \nanalog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the DAC but is measured when the DAC output is not updated. It is specified  \nin nV -s and is measured with a full -scale code change on the \ndata bus,  that is , from all 0s to all 1s and vice versa. \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD5310  \n \nRev. B | Page 11 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nD/A SECTION  \nThe AD5310 DAC is fabricated on a CMOS process. The \narchitecture consists of a string DAC followed by an output \nbuffer amplifier. Because  there is no reference input pin, the \npower supply (V DD) acts as the reference. Figure 23 shows a \nblock diagram of the DAC architecture.  \n \nFigure 23. DAC Architecture  \nBecause  the input coding to the DAC is straight binary, the ideal \noutput voltage is given by  \n\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb× =1024DV VDD OUT  \nwhere D is the  decimal equivalent of the binary code  that is \nloaded to the DAC register; it can range from 0 to 1023.  \n \nFigure 24. Resistor String  \nRESISTOR STRING  \nThe resistor string section is shown in Figure 24. It is simply a \nstring of resistors, each of value R. The code loaded to the DAC \nregister determines at what node on the string the voltage is tapped off to be fed into the output amplifier. The voltage is \ntapped off by closing one of the sw itches connecting the string to the amplifier. Because it is a string of resistors, it is guaranteed  \nmonotonic.  \nOUTPUT AMPLIFIER  \nThe output buffer amplifier is capable of generating rail -to-rail \nvoltages on its output , which results in  an output range of 0  V to \nVDD. It is capable of driving a load of 2 k Ω in parallel with 1000  pF \nto GND. The source and sink capabilities of the output amplifier  \ncan be seen in Figure 11 and Figure 12. The slew rate is 1 V/ µs \nwith a half -scale settling time of 6 µ s with the output loaded . \nSERIAL INTERFACE  \nThe AD5310 has a 3 -wire serial interface ( SYNC , SCLK , and \nDIN) that is compatible with SPI, QSPI , and MICROWIRE \ninterface standards , as well as most DSPs. See Figure 2 for a \ntiming diagram of a typical write sequence.  \nThe write sequence begins by bringing the SYNC  line low. Data \nfrom the DI N line is clocked into the 16 -bit shift register on the \nfalling edge of SCLK. The serial clock frequency can be as high \nas 30 MHz , making the AD5310 compatible with high speed \nDSPs. On the 16th  falling clock edge, the last data bit is clocked \nin and the pr ogrammed function is executed ( that is , a change in \nDAC register contents and/or a change in the mode of operation).  \nAt this stage, the SYNC  line can be kept low or be brought high. \nIn either case, it must be brought high for a minimum of  33 ns \nbefore the next write sequence so that a falling edge of SYNC  \ncan initiate the next write sequence. Because  the SYNC  buffer \ndraws more current when V IN = 2.4 V than it does when V IN = \n0.8 V , SYNC  should be idled low between write sequences for \neven lower power operation of the part. As previously mentioned,  \nhowever, it must be brought high again just before the next write  \nsequence.  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nThe input shift register is 16 bits wide (see Figure 25). The first \ntwo bits are don’t cares. The next two bits are control bits that \ncontrol which mode of operation t he part is in (normal mode or \none of the three power -down modes). There is a more complete \ndescription of the various modes in the Power -Down Modes  \nsection. The next 1 0 bits are the data bits. These are transferred \nto the DAC register on the 16th  falling edge of SCLK. Finally, \nthe last two bits are don’t cares.  \n \nFigure 25. Input Register Contents  \n\nAD5310  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 12 of 16 SYNC  INTERRUPT \nIn a normal write sequence, the SYNC  line is kept low for at \nleast 16 falling edges of SCLK , and the DAC is updated on the \n16th falling edge. However, if SYNC  is brought high before the \n16th falling edge , this acts as an interrupt to the write sequence. \nThe shift register is reset , and the write sequence is seen as \ninvalid. Neither an update of the DAC register contents or a \nchange in the operating mode occurs  (see Figure 28). \nPOWER -ON RESET  \nThe AD5310 contains a power -on reset circuit that  controls the \noutput voltage during powe r-up. The DAC register is filled with \n0s, and the output voltage is 0 V . It remains there until a valid \nwrite sequence is performed  to the DAC. This is useful in \napplications where it is important to know the state of the \noutput of the DAC while it is in t he process of powering up.  \nPOWER -DOWN MODES  \nThe AD5310 contains four separate modes of operation. These \nmodes are software  programmable by setting two bits (DB13 \nand DB12) in the control register. Table 5 shows how the state \nof the bits corresponds to the mode of operation of the device.  \nTable 5. Modes of Operation for the AD5310  \nOperating Mode  DB13  DB12 \nNormal Operation  0 0 \nPower -Down Modes    \n1 kΩ to GND  0 1 \n100 k Ω to GND  1 0 \nThree -State  1 1 \n \nWhen both bits are set to 0, the part works normally with its \nnormal power consumption of 140 µ A at 5 V . However, for the \nthree power -down modes, the supply current falls to 200 nA at \n5 V (50 nA at 3 V). Not only does the supply current fall, but \nthe output stage is also internally switched from the output of the amplifier to a resistor network of k nown values. This has the \nadvantage of knowing  the output impedance of the part when  the part is in power -down mode. There are three options. The \noutput is connected internally to GND through a 1  kΩ resistor, \na 100 k Ω resistor , or it is left open -circuited  (three -state ). The \noutput stage is illustrated in Figure 26. \n \nFigure 26. Output Stage During Power -Down  \nThe bias generator, the output ampl ifier, the resistor string , and \nother associated linear circuitry are all shut down when the \npower -down mode is activated. However, the contents of the \nDAC register are unaffected when in power -down. The time to \nexit power -down is typically 2.5 µs for V DD = 5 V and 5 µ s for \nVDD = 3 V  (see Figure 21). \nMICROPROCESSOR INTER FACING  \nAD5310 to ADSP -2101  Interface  \nFigure 27 shows a serial interface between the AD5310 and the \nADSP -2101. The ADSP -2101 should be set up to operate in the \nSPORT transmit alternate framing mode . The ADSP -2101SPORT \nis programmed through the SPORT cont rol register and should \nbe configured as follows: internal clock operation, active low \nframing, 16 -bit word length. Transmission is initiated by writing  \na word to the Tx register after the SPORT has been enabled.  \n \nFigure 27. AD5310 to ADSP -2101  Interface \n \n \nFigure 28.

B | Page 13 of 16 AD5310 to 68HC11/68L11 Interface  \nFigure 29 shows a serial interface between the AD5310 and the \n68HC11/68L11 microcontroller. SCK of the 68HC11/68L11 \ndrives the SCLK of the AD5310, while the MOSI output drives \nthe serial data line of the DAC. The SYNC  signal is derived \nfrom a port line (PC7). The setup conditions for correct \noperation of this interface are as follows: the 68HC11/68L11 should be configured so that its CPOL bit is a 0 and its CPHA \nbit is a 1. When data is being transmitted to the DAC, the \nSYNC  \nline is taken low (PC7). With  this 68HC11/68L11 configur ation , \ndata appearing on the MOSI output is valid on the falling edge \nof SCK. Serial data from the 68HC11/68L11 is transmitted in  \n8-bit bytes with only eight falling clock edges occurring in the \ntransmit cycle. Data is transmitted MSB first. To load data to the \nAD5310, PC7 is left low after the first eight bits are transferred, a second serial write operation is performed to the DAC , and \nPC7 i s taken high at the end of this procedure.  \n \nFigure 29.

The setup for the interface is as follows: TXD of the 80C51/80L51 drives SCLK of the AD5310 \nwhile RXD drives the serial data line of the part. The \nSYNC  \nsignal is again derived from a bit -programmable pin on the \nport. In this case , Port Line P3.3 is used. When data is to be transmitted to the AD5310, P3.3 is taken low. The 80C51/80L51 \ntransmits data only in 8 -bit b ytes; therefore,  only eight falling \nclock edges occur in the transmit cycle. To load data to the \nDAC, P3.3 is left low after the first eight bits are transmitted, and a second write cycle is initiated to transmit the second byte of data. P3.3 is taken high  following the completion of this \ncycle. The 80C51/ 80L51 outputs the serial data in a format that  \nhas the LSB first . The AD5310 requires that the  MSB of data  be \nreceived  first. The  80C51/80L51 transmit routine should take \nthis into account.  \n \nFigure 30.

Serial data is shifted out  \non the falling edge of the serial clock and  is clocked into the \nAD5310 on the rising edge of the SK.  \n \nFigure 31.

B | Page 14 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nUSING REF19 x AS A POWER SUPPLY FO R AD5310  \nBecause the supply current required by the AD5310 is extremely  \nlow, an alternative option is to use a REF19x voltage reference \n(REF195 for 5 V or REF193  for 3 V) to supply the required voltage \nto the part (see Figure 32). This is especially useful if the  power \nsupply is quite noisy or if the system supply voltages are at some \nvalue other than 5 V or 3 V ( for exa mple, 15 V). The REF19x \noutput s a steady supply voltage for the AD5310. If the low dropout  \nREF195 is used, the current that  it needs to supply to the AD5310 \nis 140 µ A. This is with no load on the o utput of the DAC. When \nthe DAC output is loaded, the REF195 also needs to supply the \ncurrent to the load. The total current required (with a 5 k Ω load \non the DAC output) is  \n140 µA + (5 V/5 k Ω) = 1.14 mA  \nThe loa d regulation of the REF195 is typically 2 ppm/mA , which \nresults in an error of 2.3 ppm (11.5 µ V) for the 1.14 mA current \ndrawn from it. This corresponds to a 0.002 LSB error.  \n \nFigure 32. REF195 as Power Supply to AD5310  \nBIPOLAR OPERATION US ING THE AD5310  \nThe AD5310 is designed for single -supply operation but a bipolar  \noutput range is also possible using the circuit shown in Figure 33. \nThis circuit results in  an output voltage range of ±5 V . Rail -to-rail \noperation at the amplifier o utput is achievable using an AD820 \nor an OP295 as the output amplifier. The output voltage for any \ninput code can be calculated as follows:  \n\uf8fa\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ee\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb× −\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb+×\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb× =\nR1R2V\nR1R2R1 DV V\nDD DD O1024 \nwhere  D represents the input code in decimal (0  to 1023).  \nWith VDD =  5  V,  R1  = R2 = 10 k Ω, \nV5102410−\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb×=DVO  \nThis is an output voltage range of ±5 V , with 000 hex corresponding  \nto a − 5 V output and 3FF hex corresponding to a +5 V output.   \nFigure 33. Bipolar Operation with the AD5310  \nUSING AD5310  WITH AN OPTO -ISOLATED \nINTERFACE  \nIn process  control applications in industrial environments, it is \noften necessary to use an opto -isolat ed interface to protect and \nisolate the controlling circuitry from any hazardous common -\nmode voltages that  may occur in the area where the DAC is \nfunctioning. Opto -isolators provide isolation in excess of 3 kV . \nBecause the AD5310 uses a 3 -wire serial logic interface, it only \nrequires three opto -isolators to provide the required isolation \n(see Figure 34). The power supply to t he part also needs to be \nisolated. This is done by using a transformer. On the DAC side \nof the transformer, a 5 V regulator provides the 5 V supply required  \nfor the AD5310.  \n \nFigure 34. AD5310 with an Opto -Isolated Interface \n\nData Sheet  AD5310  \n \nRev. B | Page 15 of 16 POWER SUPPLY BYPASSI NG AND GROUNDING  \nWhen accuracy is important in a circuit , it is helpful to carefully \nconsider the power supply and ground return layout on the board.  \nThe printed circuit board containing the AD5310 should have \nseparate analog and digital sections, each having their own area \nof the board. If the AD5310 is in a system where other devices \nrequire an AGND to DGND connection, the connection should be made at one point only. This ground point should be as close as possible to the AD5310.  \nThe power supply to the AD5310  should be bypassed with 10  µF \nand 0.1 µ F capacitors. The capacitors should be physically as \nclose as possible to the device , with the 0.1 µ F capacitor ideally \nright up against the device. The 10 µF capacitors are the tantalum  \nbead type. It is important that the 0.1 µ F capacitor has low effective  \nseries resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESI), such  \nas is the case with  common ceramic types of capacitors. This 0.1 µF capacitor provides a  low impedance path to ground for \nhigh frequencies caused by transient currents due to internal logic switching.  \nThe power supply line itself should have as large a trace as possible  \nto provide a low impedance path and to reduce glitch effects on \nthe suppl y line. Clocks and other fast switching digital signals \nshould be shielded from other parts of the board by digital ground. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals if possible. When traces cross on opposite sides of the board , ensure that they  \nrun at  right angles to each other to reduce feedthrough effects \nthrough the board. The best board layout technique is the micro -\nstrip technique , where the component side of the board is \ndedicated to the ground plane only and the signal traces are placed on the s older side. However, this is not always possible \nwith a 2 -layer board.  \n \nAD5310  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.
