A 06/152\nPFS7523-7529/7533-7539\nwww.power.com Description\nThe HiperPFS™-3 devices incorporate a continuous conduction mode \n(CCM) boost PFC controller, gate driver, ultra-low reverse recovery \n(Qspeed™) diode and high-voltage power MOSFET in a single, \nlow-profile (GROUND pin connected) power package.  HiperPFS-3 \ndevices eliminate the PFC converter’s need for external current sense \nresistors and the associated power loss, and use an innovative control \ntechnique that adjusts the switching frequency over output load, \ninput line voltage, and even input line cycle.\nThis control technique maximizes efficiency over the entire load range \nof the converter, particularly at light loads.  Additionally, it significant -\nly minimizes the EMI filtering requirements due to its wide bandwidth \nspread spectrum effect.  The HiperPFS-3 uses advanced digital \ntechniques for line monitoring functions, line feed-forward scaling, and \npower factor enhancement, while using analog techniques for the \ncore controller in order to maintain extremely low no-load power \nconsumption.  The HiperPFS-3 also features an integrated non-linear \nerror amplifier for enhanced load transient response, a user program -\nmable Power Good (PG) signal as well as user selectable power limit \nfunctionality.  HiperPFS-3 includes Power Integrations’ standard set of \ncomprehensive protection features, such as integrated UV, OV, \nbrown-in/out, and hysteretic thermal shutdown.  HiperPFS-3 also \nprovides cycle-by-cycle current limit and Safe Operating Area (SOA) \nprotection of the power MOSFET, power limiting of the output for \noverload protection, and pin-to-pin short-circuit protection.\nHiperPFS-3’s innovative variable frequency continuous conduction \nmode operation (VF-CCM) minimizes switching losses by maintaining \na low average switching frequency, while modulating the switching \nfrequency in order to suppress EMI, the traditional challenge with \ncontinuous conduction mode solutions.  Systems using HiperPFS-3 \ntypically reduce the total X and Y capacitance requirements of the \nconverter, the inductance of both the boost choke and EMI noise \nsuppression chokes, thereby reducing overall system size and cost.  \nAdditionally, HiperPFS-3 devices dramatically reduce component count \nand board footprint while simplifying system design and enhancing \nreliability, when compared with designs that use discrete MOSFETs \nand controllers.  The innovative variable frequency, continuous \nconduction mode controller enables the HiperPFS-3 to realize all of \nthe benefits of continuous conduction mode operation while leverag -\ning low-cost, small, simple EMI filters.\nMany regions mandate high power factor for many electronic \nproducts with high power requirements.  These rules are combined \nwith numerous application-specific standards that require high power \nsupply efficiency across the entire load range, from full load to as low \nas 10% load.  High efficiency at light load is a challenge for traditional \nPFC solutions in which fixed MOSFET switching frequencies cause \nfixed switching losses on each cycle, even at light loads.  In addition \nto featuring relatively flat efficiency across the load range, HiperPFS-3 \nalso enables high power factor of >0.92 at 20% load.  HiperPFS-3 \nsimplifies compliance with new and emerging energy-efficiency \nstandards over a broad market space in applications such as PCs, LCD \nTVs, notebooks, appliances, pumps, motors, fans, printers and LED \nlighting.HiperPFS-3’s advanced power packaging technology and high \nefficiency simplify the complexity of mounting the IC and thermal \nmanagement, while providing very high power capabilities in a single \ncompact package; these devices are suitable for PFC applications \nfrom 75 W to 900 W.\nProduct Highlights\nProtected Power Factor Correction Solution\n• Incorporates high-voltage power MOSFET, ultra-low reverse \nrecovery loss Qspeed diode, controller and gate driver.\n• EN61000-3-2 Class C and Class D compliance.\n• Integrated protection features reduce external component count.\n• Accurate built-in brown-in/out protection.\n• Accurate built-in undervoltage (UV) protection.\n• Accurate built-in overvoltage (OV) protection.\n• Hysteretic thermal shutdown (OTP).\n• Internal power limiting function for overload protection.\n• Cycle-by-cycle power switch current limit.\n• Internal non-linear error amplifier for enhanced load transient \nresponse.\n• No external current sense resistor required.\n• Provides ‘lossless’ internal sensing via sense-FET.\n• Reduces component count and system losses.\n• Minimizes high current gate drive loop area.\n• Minimizes output overshoot and stresses during start-up\n• Integrated power limit.\n• Improved dynamic response.\n• Digitally controlled input line feed-forward gain adjustment for \nflattened loop gain across entire input voltage range.\n• Eliminates up to 40 discrete components for higher reliability and \nlower cost.\nSolution for High Efficiency, Low EMI and High PF\n• Continuous conduction mode PFC uses novel constant amp-second \n[on-time] volt-second [off-time] control engine.\n• High efficiency across load.\n• High power factor across load.\n• Low cost EMI filter.\n• Frequency sliding technique for light load efficiency improvements.\n• >95% efficiency from 10% load to full load achievable at \nnominal input voltages.\n• Variable switching frequency to simplify EMI filter design. \n• Varies over line input voltage to maximize efficiency and \nminimize EMI filter requirements.\n• Varies with input line cycle voltage by >60 kHz to maximize \nspread spectrum effect.\nAdvanced Package for High Power Applications\n• Up to 450 W [universal], 1 kW [high-line only] peak output power \ncapability in a highly compact package.\n• Simple adhesive or clip mounting to heat sink.\n• No insulation pad required and can be directly connected to heat \nsink.\n• Staggered pin arrangement for simple routing of board traces and \nhigh-voltage creepage requirements.\n• Single package solution for PFC converter reduces assembly costs \nand layout size.\nRev.

The bias voltage must be externally clamped to \nprevent the BIAS POWER pin from exceeding 15 VDC to ensure \nlong-term reliability.\nREFERENCE (REF) Pin:\nThis pin is connected to an external bypass capacitor and is used to \nprogram the IC for either FULL or EFFICIENCY power mode.  The \nexternal capacitor is connected between the REFERENCE and SIGNAL \nGROUND [G] pins.  Note: the return trace to G must not be shared with \nother return traces with a potential for large return currents during \nsurge events.  The REFERENCE pin has two valid capacitor values to \nselect ‘Full’ (1.0 µF ±20%) and ‘Efficiency’ (0.1 µF ±20%) power \nmodes.\nSIGNAL GROUND (G) Pin:\nDiscrete components used in the feedback circuit, including loop \ncompensation, decoupling capacitors for the BIAS POWER (VCC), \nREFERENCE (REF) and VOLTAGE MONITOR (V) must be referenced to \nthe SIGNAL GROUND (G) pin.  The SIGNAL GROUND pin is also \nconnected to the tab of the device.  The SIGNAL GROUND pin should \nnot be tied directly to the SOURCE pin external to the IC.\nVOLTAGE MONITOR (V) Pin:\nThe VOLTAGE MONITOR pin is tied to the rectified high-voltage DC \nrail through a 100:1, 1% high-impedance resistor divider to minimize \npower dissipation and standby power consumption.  The recommend -\ned resistance value is between 8 M Ω and 16 M Ω.  Modifying this \ndivider ratio affects peak power limit, brown-in/out thresholds and \nwill degrade input current quality (reduce power factor and increase \nTHD).  A small ceramic capacitor forming an 80 µs nominal time-\nconstant is required from the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin to the SIGNAL \nGROUND pin to bypass any switching noise present on the rectified \nDC bus.\nThis pin also features brown-in/out detection thresholds and \nincorporates a weak current source into the IC in order to act as a \npull-down in the event of an open circuit condition.\nCOMPENSATION (C) Pin:\nThis pin is used for loop pole/zero compensation of the OTA error \namplifier via the connection of a network of capacitors and a resistor \nbetween the COMPENSATION pin and SIGNAL GROUND pin.  The \nCOMPENSATION pin connects internally to the output of the OTA error \namplifier and the input to the on-time and off-time controllers.\nFEEDBACK (FB) Pin:\nThis pin is connected to the main voltage regulation feedback resistor \ndivider network and is also used for fast over and undervoltage \nprotection.  This pin also detects the presence of the feedback \nvoltage divider network at start-up and during operation.  The divider \nratio should be the same as the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin for proper and \noptimized power limit and power factor.  A large upper resistor \nbetween 8 M Ω and 16 M Ω ±1% is recommended.  A small ceramic \ncapacitor between FEEDBACK and SIGNAL GROUND, forming a nominal \n80 µs time-constant with the bottom resistor, is required.\nPOWER GOOD (PG) Pin:\nUse of the PG function is optional.  The POWER GOOD pin is an \nactive low, open-drain connection which sinks current when the \noutput voltage is in regulation.  At start-up, once the FEEDBACK pin \nvoltage has risen to ~95% of the internal reference voltage, the \nPOWER GOOD pin is asserted low.   After start-up, the output voltage threshold at which the PG signal \nbecomes high-impedance depends on the threshold programmed by \nthe POWER GOOD THRESHOLD pin resistor.  When not in use, the \nPOWER GOOD pin is left unconnected.\nPOWER GOOD THRESHOLD (PGT) Pin:\nThis pin is used to program the output voltage threshold at which the \nPG signal becomes high-impedance representing the PFC stage falling \nout of regulation.  The low threshold for the PG signal is programmed \nwith a resistor between the POWER GOOD THRESHOLD and SIGNAL \nGROUND pins.  Tying POWER GOOD THRESHOLD to the REFERENCE \npin disables the power good function (i.e. POWER GOOD pin remains \nhigh impedance).\nSOURCE (S) Pins:\nThese pins are the source connection of the power switch as well as \nthe negative bulk capacitor terminal connection.\nPI-7225-061615H Package (eSIP-16D)\n(Front View)\nH Package\n(eSIP-16D)\n(Back View)\nL Package (eSIP-16G)\n(Front View)16\nVCCREFGVCFBPGPGTDK\n16KS\nS13\nD13NC14\nNC1411\nS119PGT910\nS108PG81VCC13REF34G45V56C67FB7Exposed Pad (Backside)\nInternally Connected to GROUND (G) PinExposed Metal (Both H and L Packages) (On Package Edge) Internally Connected to G Pin\n1\n34\n56\n78\n910\n1113\n1416Pin 1 I.D.Pin 1 I.D.\nG G\nVCCREFGVCFBPGPGTDK\nS\nSNCExposed Pad\n(Backside)Not Shown\nFigure 3.

Functional Block Diagram.\nDRAIN (D) Pin:\nThis is the drain connection of the internal power switch.\nBOOST DIODE CATHODE (K) Pin:\nThis is the cathode connection of the internal Qspeed Diode.\nFunctional Description\nThe HiperPFS-3 is a variable switching frequency boost PFC solution.  \nMore specifically, it employs a constant amp-second on-time and \nconstant volt-second off-time control algorithm.  This algorithm is \nused to regulate the output voltage and shape the input current to \ncomply with regulatory harmonic current limits (high power factor).  \nIntegrating the switch current and controlling it to have a constant \namp-sec product over the on-time of the switch allows the average \ninput current to follow the input voltage.  Integrating the difference \nbetween the output and input voltage maintains a constant volt-\nsecond balance dictated by the electro-magnetic properties of the \nboost inductor and thus regulates the output voltage and power.\nMore specifically, the control technique sets constant volt-seconds for \nthe off-time (tOFF).

The charge per cycle is varied \ngradually over many switching cycles in response to load changes so \nit can be regarded as substantially constant for a half line cycle.  With \nthis constant charge (or amp-second) control, the following relation -\nship is therefore also true:\n       #It K IN ON 2=        (3)\nSubstituting tON from (2) into (3) gives:\n           (4)  \n      # IVKK\nIN IN\n12=\n         \nThe relationship of (4) demonstrates that by controlling a constant \namp-second on-time and constant volt-second off-time, the input \ncurrent IIN is proportional to the input voltage VIN, therefore providing \nthe fundamental requirement of power factor correction.\nRev. A 06/155\nPFS7523-7529/7533-7539\nwww.power.com Figure 5. Idealized Converter Waveforms.This control produces a continuous mode power switch current \nwaveform that varies both in frequency and peak current value across \na line half-cycle to produce an input current proportional to the input \nvoltage.\nControl Engine\nThe controller features a low bandwidth, high gain OTA error-amplifi -\ner of which its non-inverting terminal is connected to an internal \nvoltage reference of 3.85 V.  The inverting terminal of the error-am -\nplifier is available on the external FEEDBACK pin which connects to \nthe output voltage divider network with a divider ratio of 1:100 to \nregulate the output voltage to 385 V nominally.  The FEEDBACK pin \nconnects directly to the divider network for fast transient load \nresponse.\nThe internally sensed FET switch current is scaled by the input \nvoltage peak detector current sense gain (MON) then integrated and \ncompared with the error-amplifier signal (VE) to determine the cycle \non-time.  Internally the difference between the input and output \nvoltage is derived and the resultant is scaled, integrated, and \ncompared to a voltage reference (VOFF) to determine the cycle \noff-time.  Careful selection of the internal scaling factors produces \ninput current waveforms with very low distortion and high power \nfactor.\nLine Feed-Forward Scaling Factor (MON) and PF Enhancer\nThe VOLTAGE MONITOR (V) pin voltage is sampled and converted by \na Δ-Σ ADC to a quantized digital value.  A digital line cycle peak detec -\ntor, with dynamic time constants and multi-cycle filtering, derives and \nsmooths the peak of the input line voltage.  This peak is used \ninternally to scale the gain of the current sense signal through the \nMON variable.  This contribution is required to reduce the dynamic \nrange of the control feedback signal as well as flatten the loop gain \nover the operating input line range.  The line-sense feed-forward gain \nadjustment is proportional to the square of the peak rectified AC line \nvoltage and is adjusted as a function of the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin \nvoltage.\nAt high-line and light load, the feed-forward MON variable is dynami -\ncally adjusted throughout the line cycle in order to compensate for \nthe line current distortion through the EMI filter and full bridge \nnetwork, thereby improving power factor.The line-sense feed-forward gain is also important in providing a \nswitch power limit over the input line range.\nThis characteristic is optimized to maintain a relatively constant \ninternal error-voltage level at full load from an input line of 90 to  \n230 VAC.\nBeyond the specified peak power rating of the device, the internal \npower limit feature will regulate the output voltage below the set \nregulation threshold as a function of output overload to maintain a \nconstant output power.  Figure 6 illustrates the typical regulation \ncharacteristic as a function of load.\nBelow the brown-in threshold (VBR+) the power limit is reduced when \nthe device is operated in the ‘Full’ power mode as shown in Figure 7.  \nAs the input line voltage is reduced toward the brown-out threshold \n(VBR-) and if the load exceeds the power limit derating, the boost \noutput voltage will drop out of regulation in accordance with Figure 6.\nThe rated peak power shown in Table 1 is not derated for voltages \nbelow the brown-in threshold when the device is operated in the \n‘Efficiency’ mode.\nStart-Up with Pin-to-Pin Short-Circuit Protection\nAt start-up, the engine performs a sequence of operational checks \nand pin short/open evaluations, as illustrated in Figure 8, prior to the \ncommencement of switching.  When the input voltage peak is above \nbrown-in, the engine enables switching.\nThe OTA error amplifier provides a non-linear amplifier (NLA) \nmechanism to overcome the inherently slow feedback loop response \nwhen the sensed output voltage on the FEEDBACK pin is outside its \nregulation window.  This allows the error amplifier function to limit \nthe maximum overshoot and undershoot during load transient events.\nTo reduce switch and output diode current stress at start-up, the \nHiperPFS-3 calculates off-time based upon output voltage (VOUT) during \nstart-up, resulting in a relatively soft controlled start-up.\nOnce the applied VCC is above the VCCUVLO+ threshold, and the output \nof the on-chip VREF regulator is above REFUV+, the value of the \nREFERENCE pin capacitor is detected and the full or efficiency power \nmode is latched.  The pin open/short tests are performed, and if the \nFEEDBACK pin voltage is valid the over-temperature OTP is checked \nto be false.  Once the preceding checks are satisfied the input voltage \nis monitored via the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin until it exceeds the VBR+ \nthreshold [but the peak detector is not saturated].  It is at this point \nthat switching is enabled.\nTiming Supervisor and Operating Frequency Range\nSince the controller is expected to operate with a variable switching \nfrequency over the line frequency half-cycle, typically spanning a \nrange of 22 – 123 kHz when operating in CCM, the controller also \nfeatures a timing supervisor function which monitors and limits the \nmaximum switch on-time and off-time as well as ensures a minimum \ncycle on-time.  Figure 9(a) shows the typical half-line frequency \nprofile of the device switching frequency as a function of input \nvoltage at peak load conditions.  Figure 9(b) shows for a given line \ncondition of 115 VAC, the effect of EcoSmart™ on the switching \nfrequency as a function of load.  The switching frequency is not a \nfunction of boost choke inductance in CCM (continuous conduction \nmode) operation.PI-5335-061615IS dtVE\nVOFF\n(VOUT-VIN)dtLatch\nRESET\nLatch\nSET\nGate\nDrive (Q)\nMaximum\nON-time\nMinimum\nOFF-timeTiming\nSupervisor\nRev.

EcoSmart Frequency Slide VOFF vs. VE and VOFF(MAX) vs. Input Voltage.EcoSmart\nThe HiperPFS-3 includes an EcoSmart function wherein the internal \nerror signal (VE) is used to detect the converter output power.  Since \nthe internal error-signal is related to the output power, this signal \nlevel is used to set the average switching frequency as a function of \noutput power.\nAs shown in Figure 10, the off-time integrator control reference (VOFF) \nis controlled with respect to the internal error-voltage level (output \npower) to allow the converter to maintain output voltage regulation \nand relatively flat conversion efficiency from 20% to 100% of rated \nload, which is essential to meet many efficiency directives.  The \ndegree of frequency slide is also controlled as a function of input line \nvoltage.  The lower VOFF slope as a function of input voltage reduces \nthe average frequency extremes for high input line operation.\nBurst-Mode for No-Load Power Consumption Reduction\nUnder no-load conditions the HiperPFS-3 engine is architected to \nenter a burst mode which gates the power switch on and off between \nfixed error voltage levels.

Higher output voltage \nripple at light load is an artifact of efficient burst mode operation.\nPower Good Signal (PG) \nThe HiperPFS-3 features a ‘power good’ (PG) circuit which comprises \nan internal comparator that turns ‘on’ an open-drain switch during \nstart-up when the sensed output voltage on the FEEDBACK pin rises \nto ~95% (VPG+) of the set output voltage threshold.  During start-up, \nprior to the output voltage reaching VPG+, the PG signal is in a \nhigh-impedance state (internal switch is in ‘off’ state).\nThe power good signal transitions from ‘on’ to ‘off’ state when the \nsensed output voltage on the FEEDBACK pin falls to a user selected \nthreshold, programmed with a resistor on the POWER GOOD \nTHRESHOLD (PGT) pin.  The POWER GOOD THRESHOLD pin sources a \nfixed current IPGT.  This current combined with the power good thresh -\nold resistor sets the threshold when the power good signal transitions \nfrom the ‘on’ state to the high-impedance ‘off’ state as the PFC \noutput falls out of regulation. \nRev. A 06/158\nPFS7523-7529/7533-7539\nwww.power.com The power good comparator has an internal 81 µs de-glitch filter \n(tPGD) to prevent noise events from falsely triggering the programmed \nVPG- threshold.\nIn the event a load fault prevents the boost from achieving regulation \n(above ~95% of the set output voltage threshold) the PG function will \nremain in the high-impedance state and will not indicate when an \noutput voltage has fallen below the user programmed VPG- threshold.  \nThe VPG- user programmed threshold is enabled once the VPG+ \nthreshold has been reached.\nIf the POWER GOOD THRESHOLD programming pin is tied to \nREFERENCE pin, the power good function is disabled and PG remains \nin the high-impedance (‘off’) state.  This is the preferred configuration \nwhen PG is not in use.  If the POWER GOOD THRESHOLD pin is shorted \nto the SIGNAL GROUND pin, the PG signal will transition to the ‘on’ \nstate at VPG+ and remain low (‘on’) until the PFC output voltage has \nfallen below the VFB_UV threshold for greater than tFB_UV seconds.\nSimilar to the disable condition described above, if the value of the \nPGT resistor is such that the VPG- threshold is greater than the VPG+ \nthreshold, the PG signal will latch off and remain in the high-imped -\nance off-state.\nThe Power Good function is not valid under the following conditions:\nA. VCC or VREF are not in a valid range of operation.  VCC below \nUVLO- or VREF below REFUV- the power good function is not valid \nwith the POWER GOOD pin in a high-impedance state.\nB. Power Good will go to high-impedance state when a soft-  shut -\ndown is initiated by an over-temperature fault to provide early \nindication to secondary circuits of an OT fault.\nC. PGT is outside the valid programming range of between 225 V and \n360 V.  PGT voltages above this range, including PGT floating, will \nprevent PG from transitioning to active pull-down.  PGT voltages \nbelow this range result in PG deassertion at the output undervolt -\nage (VFB_UV) threshold.\nD. Once the start-up sequence check has passed and the converter \ngoes into start-up, if PGT is opened, then the PG signal will \nremain latched in the high-impedance state until the controller is \nreset.\nFigure 11. Power Good Function Description.Selectable Power Limit\nThe capacitor on the REFERENCE pin allows user selection between \n’full’ and ‘efficiency’ power limit for each device.  The ‘efficiency’ \npower mode will permit user selection of a larger device for a given \noutput power requirement for increased conversion efficiency.\nIn ‘full’ power mode the REFERENCE pin capacitor is 1.0 µF ±20% \nand the ‘efficiency’ power limit mode is selected with a 0.1 µF ±20% \ncapacitor.\nIf the REFERENCE pin is accidentally shorted to ground, the IC will \ndisable switching and remain disabled until all conditions for the \nstart-up sequence are satisfied.\nIf the REFERENCE pin is open-circuit, the absence of a bypass \ncapacitor will prevent start-up.  During operation, an open-circuit may \nresult in enough REFERENCE pin noise to result in a VREF REFUV- shut-\ndown.\nProtection Modes\nBrown-In Protection (VBR+)\nThe VOLTAGE MONITOR pin features an input line under-voltage \ndetection to limit the minimum start-up voltage.  This detection \nthreshold will inhibit the device from starting at input AC voltages \nbelow brown-in and above input peak voltages of 400 VPK.\nBrown-Out Protection (VBR-)\nThe VOLTAGE MONITOR pin features a brown-out protection mode \nwherein the HiperPFS-3 will turn-off when the VOLTAGE MONITOR \npin voltage is below the line undervoltage threshold (VBR-) for a period \nexceeding tBRWN_OUT (brown-out debounce period).  In the event a \nsingle half-line cycle is missing (normal operating line frequency is  \n47 Hz to 63 Hz) the brown-out detection will not be initiated.  Once \nbrown-out has been triggered, the HiperPFS-3 soft-shutdown \ngradually reduces the internal error-voltage to zero volts over a period \nof 1 ms to ramp the power MOSFET on-time to zero.  The onset of \nthis soft-shutdown is aligned to the next line cycle zero crossing to \nminimize reactive component di/dt transients and allow time for the \nenergy stored within the boost choke as well as the input EMI filter to \ndissipate.  This helps minimize voltage transients after the bridge \nrectifier, which helps to prevent false restarts.

If the line does not recover \nabove the VBR-NTC threshold before the tBRWN_OUT_NTC debounce timer \nexpires a shutdown will occur.\nAfter the tSTARTUP timer has expired, if the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin \nvoltage is qualified above VBR-NTC, the brown-out debounce timer will \nswitch to normal period (tBRWN_OUT) and the brown-out threshold will \nswitch to VBR-.  If the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin voltage is not qualified \nabove VBR- after the subsequent tBRWN_OUT timer has expired then a \nbrown-out shutdown will occur.\nHiperPFS-3 incorporates input waveform discrimination to determine \nif the line signal peak-to-average ratio is more representative of a \nsinewave or a high duty cycle square wave.  The brown-out threshold \nis reduced to VBR_SQ when a high duty cycle (UPS) square wave is \ndetected.\nVCC Undervoltage Protection (UVLO) \nThe BIAS POWER (VCC) pin has an undervoltage lock-out protection \nwhich inhibits the IC from starting unless the applied VCC voltage is \nabove the VCCUVLO+ threshold.  The IC initiates a start-up once the \nBIAS POWER pin voltage exceeds the VCCUVLO+ threshold.  After \nstart-up the IC will continue to operate until the BIAS POWER pin \nvoltage has fallen below the VCCUVLO- level.  The absolute maximum \nvoltage of the BIAS POWER pin is 17.5 V which must be externally \nlimited to prevent long term damage to the IC.\nLine Dependent Over Current Protection (OCP) limit\nThe device includes a cycle-by-cycle over-current protection mech- \nanism which protects the device in the event of a fault.  The intent of \nOCP protection in this device is protection of the internal power \nMOSFET and is not specifically intended to protect the converter from \noutput short-circuit or overload fault conditions.\nFor universal line input parts, the OCP limit is set as a function of the \ninput line voltage, one setting for low-line voltages and another \nsetting for high-line voltages.  This helps to bound power limit into \nshort-circuits as well as helps to minimize the stress on the switch \ndue to current overloads at higher input line conditions.  Figure 12 \nillustrates the hysteretic adjustment of the OCP levels as a function  \nof VOLTAGE MONITOR pin line-sensing.  This equates to selecting the \nlow-line OCP (the greater of the two settings) when the peak of the \ninput line voltage drops below 140 VAC for 3 consecutive half-cycles \nand selecting the high-line OCP level (the lesser of the two settings) \nwhen the input line voltage rises above 170 VAC for 1 half-cycle, \n(except in follower mode, as described in the subsequent sections).\nThe HiperPFS-3 utilizes a high input line OCP after detecting the \nVOLTAGE MONITOR pin above the high-line threshold, VHIGH+.  The \ncontroller reverts back to low-line OCP (as well as low-line frequency \nslide) only after 3 consecutive half-line cycle peak values that are below the low-line threshold VHIGH-.  In the event of a line drop-out, \nthe controller may revert from high-line to low-line parameters if the \ndrop-out exceeds 37 ms (nominal).  High-line only input parts use a \nsingle fixed OCP threshold.\nA follower-mode feature updates the controller to high-line status \nrapidly, as soon as the input voltage exceeds VHIGH+.  This feature has \nparticular benefit for high-line hard-start conditions after a long AC \nline drop-out where the peak detector may initially indicate a low \ninput line condition.\nA leading edge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit comparator \nfor a short time (tLEB) after the power MOSFET is turned on.  This \nleading edge blanking time is set so that switch current spikes caused \nby drain capacitance and rectifier reverse recovery time will not cause \npremature termination of the MOSFET conduction period.\nSafe Operating Area (SOA) Mode \nSince the cycle-by-cycle OCP mechanism described above does not \nprevent the possibility of inductor current ‘stair-casing’, an SOA mode \nis also featured.  Rapid build-up of the switch current can occur in the \nevent of inductor saturation or when the input and output voltage \ndifferential is small combined with too little inductor reset time.\nThe SOA mode is triggered whenever the switch current reaches \ncurrent limit (IOCP) and the on-time is less than tSOA.  The SOA mode \nforces an off-time equal to tOFF(SOA) and pulls the internal error-voltage \n(VE) down by 1/2 of its maximum value in order to ensure the switch \nremains within its SOA.\nFast Output Voltage Overvoltage Protection (FBOV)\nThe HiperPFS-3 features a voltage feedback threshold comparator on \nthe FEEDBACK pin which detects an output voltage overvoltage \ncondition to allow rapid response, independent of the COMPENSA -\nTION pin response, to prevent hazardous voltage conditions from \noccurring.  The overvoltage protection is hysteretic – the voltage on \nthe FEEDBACK pin must drop by 0.1 V (equating to an output voltage \ndrop of 10 V) before switching is re-started.\nFEEDBACK to COMPENSATION Pin Short Detection Safeguard\nThe PFC controller continuously monitors the FEEDBACK and \nCOMPENSATION pins to ensure that there are no potential short \nconditions between the adjacent FEEDBACK and COMPENSATION \npins, which could result in output overvoltage conditions if not \ndetected.  In the event a potential short is detected, a rapid short \ncheck is performed and a shutdown is executed in the event that a \nsuspected short is validated.PI-7255-061615\nIOCP \n ~170 VACVIN\n ~140 VACIOCP(LL) \nIOCP(HL)\nFigure 12.

The threshold is set at 117 °C typical with a 36 °C hysteresis.  \nWhen the controller die temperature rises above this threshold (OTP), \nthe controller initiates a soft-shutdown and remains disabled until the \ncontroller die temperature falls by ~36 °C, at which point the device \nwill re-initiate the start-up sequence.\nThe maximum time delay for soft-shutdown to occur after an OTP \nevent is detected is tOTP beyond the next zero-crossing.\nHiperPFS-3 Additional Features and Changes\nNote: HiperPFS-3 is not a pin for pin drop-in replacement of  \nHiperPFS-2 due to functional changes and optimizations.\n• Improved operating supply voltage maximum: 15 V.\n• Reduced external component count.\n• Improved tolerance of key parameters over a wide temperature \nrange.\n• Modified architecture improving noise immunity and operational \naccuracy.\n• Feedback network voltage divider is decoupled from the loop \ncompensation components.\n• High-line only family of parts added to HiperPFS-3 family.\n• Peak-detector supports deglitch methodology for NTC in-rush \ncurrent limiting at start-up.\n• Digital Power Factor Enhancer algorithm improves high-line light \nload power factor.\n• OTA error amplifier replaces voltage error amplifier of  \nHiperPFS-2.• NLA implemented via fixed current sources for quick transient \nresponse, replaces switched voltage gain in HiperPFS-2.\n• Off-time controller senses actual feedback voltage to calculate \noff-time to prevent inductor saturation.\n• VOLTAGE MONITOR pin uses voltage-mode sensing rather than \ncurrent-mode sensing of HiperPFS-2, allowing flexibility in selection \nof magnitude of resistor divider.\n• Reduced minimum line feed-forward gain supports higher power \ndelivery during line sag events.\n• Line feed-forward gain implemented with true squaring function, \nversus piece-wise linear approximation.\n• Line voltage functions performed in the digital domain: peak detec -\ntion, feed-forward, brown-in/brown-out and PF-enhancement.\n• Peak detector incorporates filtering to smooth out cycle-to-cycle \nvariation.\n• Optimized brown-in/brown-out thresholds with tighter tolerances.\n• Most timers are derived from an internal high-speed clock \nproviding accurate timing.\n• eSIP-16 package pinout has been modified for optimal operation \nand internal grounding.\n• No-load/light-load power consumption optimized by re-engineered \nburst-mode operation.\n• Reduced control-engine power consumption: standby current \nreduced by ~4~5 × HiperPFS-2 nominal.\n• HiperPFS-3 REFERENCE pin replaces HiperPFS-2 REFERENCE pin; \nexternal bypass capacitor replaces external 1% resistor.\n• VFB(REF) reduced to 3.85 V nominal from 6.0 V nominal in  \nHiperPFS-2.\n• Peak detector optimized across maximum operational conditions \nwhen operating with distorted waveforms and line drop-outs.\n• Square-wave detector feature for improved UPS operation.\n• Power good function is independent of engine during operation \nexcept for OTP events.\n• FBOFF fault check is always enabled during operation.\n• Maximum CCM peak switching frequency has been increased from \n~100 kHz to 123 kHz.\nRev.

This design is rated \nfor a continuous output power of 275 W and provides a regulated \noutput voltage of 385 VDC nominal, maintaining a high input power \nfactor and overall efficiency from light load to full load.\nFuse F1 provides protection to the circuit and isolates it from the AC \nsupply in the event of a fault.  Diode bridge BR1 rectifies the AC input \nvoltage.  Capacitors C1-C7 together with inductors L2 and L3 form \nthe EMI filter which reduces the common mode and differential mode \nnoise.  Resistors R1, R2 and CAPZero, IC U2 are required to discharge \nthe EMI filter capacitors once the circuit is disconnected.  CAPZero \neliminates static losses in R1 and R2 by only connecting these \ncomponents across the input when AC is removed.\nMetal oxide varistor (MOV) RV1 protects the circuit during line surge \nevents by effectively clamping the input voltage seen by the power \nsupply.\nThe boost converter stage consists of inductor L1, and the Hiper -\nPFS-3 IC U1.  This stage functions as a boost converter and controls \nthe input current of the power supply while simultaneously regulating \nthe output DC voltage.  Diode D2 prevents a resonant buildup of \noutput voltage at start-up by bypassing inductor L1 while simultane -\nously charging output capacitor C17.  \nThermistor RT1 limits the inrush input current of the circuit at \nstart-up and prevents saturation of L1.  In most high-performance \ndesigns, a relay will be used to bypass the thermistor after start-up to \nimprove power supply efficiency.  Thermistor RT1 is bypassed by the \nelectro-mechanical relay RL1 after the output voltage is in regulation \nand a power-good signal from U1 is asserted low.  Resistor R3, R4, \nand Q1 drive relay RL1 and optocoupler U3.  Diode D1 clamps the \nrelay coil reverse voltage during de-assertion transitions.  Resistor R5 limits the current to the diode in the optocoupler.  IC U3 provides \noptocoupler isolation through connector J2 for a power-good output \nsignal if required.\nCapacitor C15 is used for reducing the loop length and area of the \noutput circuit to reduce EMI and overshoot of voltage across the \ndrain and source of the MOSFET inside U1 at each switching edge.\nThe PFS7527H IC requires a regulated supply of 12 V for operation \nand must not exceed 15 V.  Resistors R6, R7, R8, Zener diode VR1, \nand transistor Q2 form a series pass regulator that prevents the \nsupply voltage to IC U1 from exceeding 15 V.  Capacitors C8,  and C9 \nfilter the supply voltage and provide bypassing and decoupling to \nensure reliable operation of IC U1.  Diode D3 provides reverse \npolarity protection.\nResistor R15 programs the output voltage level [via the power good \nthreshold (PGT) pin] below which the power good [PG] pin will go \ninto a high-impedance state.  Capacitor C14 provides noise immunity \non the POWER GOOD THRESHOLD pin.\nIC U1 is configured in full power mode by capacitor C10 which is \nconnected to the REFERENCE pin.\nThe rectified AC input voltage of the power supply is sensed by IC U1 \nusing resistors R10-R13.  These resistors values are large to minimize \npower consumption.  Capacitor C11 connected in parallel with the \nbottom resistor R13 filters noise coupled into the VOLTAGE MONITOR \npin.\nOutput voltage divider network comprising of resistors R16 – R19 are \nused to scale the output voltage and provide feedback to the IC.  \nCapacitor C16 in parallel with resistor R19 attenuates high frequency \nnoise.\nR14, C12 and C13 are required for shaping the loop response of the \nfeedback network.\nL1\n400 µHVO\nJ3-1\nJ2-2J4-1\nJ4-2RL1J2-1DC\nOUT+\nVO\nJ3-3SC\nPGTFBVCCPGK D\nREF G VCONTROL\nHiperPFS-3\nU1\nPFS7527H\nPI-7257-061615N\nPower\nGood90 - 264\nVAC\nEL\nR1\n510 kΩ\nR6\n1 Ω\n1%R3\n10 kΩ\n1%R4\n16.2 kΩ\n1%\nR5\n3.01 kΩ\n1% \nD1\nS1AB-13-FC8\n47 µF\n50 VC7\n680 nF\n450 V\nC9\n1 µF\n35 VC10\n1 µF\n50 VR14\n30.1 kΩ\n1%\nR15\n332 kΩ\n1%\nC11\n470 pF\n50 VD3\nS1AB-13-F\nVR1\nBZX384-B13,115\n13 VQ1\nMMBT4403\n3\n421\nU3\nLTV817AQ2\nMMBT4401LT1G\nR7\n1 Ω\n1%R8\n2.21 kΩ\n1%R2\n510 kΩC2\n680 pF\n250 VACBR1\nGBU8K-BP\n800 V\nL2\n9 mH\nC4\n330 nF\n275 V\nC6\n680 pF\n250 VACC5\n680 pF\n250 VACC1\n680 pF\n250 VACF1\n5 A\nRV1\n320 VAC\nVCC\nSupplyC3\n330 nF\n275 VACRT1\n2.5 Ω\nD1\nCAPZero\nU2\nCAP003DG\nD2\nL3\n330 µH\n+\n+C14\n1 nF\n50 VC17\n180 µF\n450 V\nR19\n162 kΩ\n1%R16\n3.74 MΩ\n1% R10\n6.2 MΩ\n1%\nR11\n6.2 MΩ\n1%\nR12\n3.74 MΩ\n1%\nR13\n162 kΩ\n1%R17\n6.2 MΩ\n1%\nR18\n6.2 MΩ\n1%\nC15\n10 nF\n1 kV\nC13\n1 µF\n50 VD2\n1N5408-T\nC12\n100 nF\n25 V\nC16\n470 pF\n50 VtO\nFigure 13. 275 W PFC using PFS7527H.\nRev. A 06/1513\nPFS7523-7529/7533-7539\nwww.power.com Design, Assembly, and Layout Considerations\nPower Table\nThe data sheet power table as shown in Table 2 represents the \nmaximum practical continuous output power based on the following \nconditions:\nFor the universal input devices (PFS7523L/H – PFS7529H):\n1. An input voltage range of 90 VAC to 264 VAC.\n2. Overall efficiency of at least 93% at the lowest operating voltage.\n3. 385 V nominal output.\n4. Sufficient heat sinking to keep device temperature ≤100 ºC.\nOperation beyond the limits stated above will require derating.  \nOperation at elevated temperatures could result in reduced MTBF and \nperformance degradation, e.g. reduced efficiency, reduced power \nlimit, PF, and potential of observing hysteretic brown-out, etc., and is \nnot recommended.  Use of a nominal output voltage higher than 395 V \nis not recommended for HiperPFS-3 based designs.  Operation at \nvoltages higher than 395 V can result in higher than expected \ndrain-source voltage during line and load transients.\nHiperPFS-3 Selection\nSelection of the optimum HiperPFS-3 part depends on required \nmaximum output power, PFC efficiency and overall system efficiency \n(when used with a second stage DC-DC converter), heat sinking \nconstraints, system requirements and cost goals.  The HiperPFS-3 \npart used in a design can be easily replaced with the next higher or \nlower part in the power table to optimize performance, improve \nefficiency or for applications where there are thermal design \nconstraints.  Minor adjustments to the inductance value and EMI filter \ncomponents may be necessary in some designs when the next higher \nor the next lower HiperPFS-3 part is used in an existing design for \nperformance optimization.\nEvery HiperPFS-3 family part has an optimal load level where it offers \nthe most value.  Operating frequency of a part will change depending \non load level.  Change of frequency will result in change in peak to \npeak current ripple in the inductance used.  Change in current ripple \nwill affect input PF and total harmonic distortion of input current.\nInput Fuse and Protection Circuit\nThe input fuse should be rated for a continuous current above the \ninput current at which the PFC turns-off due to input under- voltage.  \nThis voltage is referred to as the brown-out voltage.\nThe fuse should also have sufficient I2t rating in order to avoid \nnuisance failures during start-up.  At start-up a large current is drawn \nfrom the input as the output capacitor charges to the peak of the \napplied voltage.  The charging current is only limited by any inrush \nlimiting thermistors, impedance of the EMI filter inductors and the \nforward resistance of the input rectifier diodes.  A MOV will typically be \nrequired to protect the PFC from line surges.  Selection of the MOV \nrating will depend on the energy level (EN1000-4-5 Class level) which \nthe PFC is required to withstand.  \nA suitable NTC thermistor should be used on the input side to provide \ninrush current limiting.  Choice of this thermistor should depend on \nthe inrush current specification for the power supply.  NTC thermis -\ntors may not be placed in any other location in the circuit as they fail \nto limit the stress on the part in the event of line transients and also \nfail to limit the inrush current in a predictable manner.  The example \nin Figure 13 shows the circuit configuration that has the inrush \nlimiting NTC thermistor on the input side which is bypassed with a \nrelay after PFC start-up.  This arrangement ensures that a consistent \ninrush limiting performance is achieved by the circuit.Input EMI Filter\nThe variable switching frequency of the HiperPFS-3 effectively \nmodulates the switching frequency and reduces conducted EMI peaks \nassociated with the harmonics of the fundamental switching frequency.  \nThis is particularly beneficial for the average detection mode used in \nEMI measurements.\nThe PFC is a switching converter and will need an EMI filter at the \ninput in order to meet the requirements of most safety agency \nstandards for conducted and radiated EMI.  Typically a common mode \nfilter with X capacitors connected across the line will provide the \nrequired attenuation of high frequency components of input current \nto an acceptable level.  The leakage reactance of the common mode \nfilter inductor and the X capacitors form a low pass filter.  In some \ndesigns, additional differential filter inductors may have to be used to \nsupplement the differential mode inductance of the common-mode \nchoke.\nA filter capacitor with low ESR and high ripple current capability \nshould be connected at the output of the input bridge rectifier.  This \ncapacitor reduces the generation of the switching frequency compo -\nnents of the input current ripple and simplifies EMI filter design.  \nTypically, 0.33 µF per 100 W should be used for universal input \ndesigns and 0.15 µF per 100 W of output power should be used for \n230 VAC only designs.\nIt is often possible to use a higher value of capacitance after the \nbridge rectifier and reduce the X capacitance in the EMI filter.\nRegulatory requirements require use of a discharge resistor to be \nconnected across the input X capacitance on the AC side of the \nbridge rectifier.  This is to ensure that residual charge is dissipated \nafter the input voltage is removed when the capacitance is higher \nthan 0.1 µF.  Use of CAPZero integrated circuits from Power Integra -\ntions, helps eliminate the steady- state losses associated with the use \nof discharge resistors connected permanently across the X capacitors.\nInductor Design\nFor ferrite inductors the optimal design has KP of 0.3 to 0.45.  (KP is \ndefined as the current peak-to-peak value divided by the peak value \nat minimum AC voltage and 90* phase angle, full load).  KP <0.3 \n(more continuous) tends towards excessive inductor size, while higher \nKP >0.45 tends towards excessive winding AC resistance losses due to \nlarge high-frequency AC currents, especially since most ferrite \ninductor designs will require >3 winding layers.  Flux density at \nmaximum current limit should  be <3900 gauss to prevent core \nsaturation.\nIf Sendust core material is used, 90 µ or 125µ material is recommend ed, \nbecause the higher µ materials tend to produce greater inductance at \nlower currents, and thus reduced peak- to-peak inductor currents at \nlower line phase angles (<45*) which reduces losses and improves PF \nat lighter loads and higher input voltages.  The design target is for H \nat the peak current (low-line, full-load, 90* line phase angle) to be  \n~60 A-t/cm.  Higher H tends towards excessive core loss, and lower \nthan this increases AC copper losses.\nThe HiperPFS-3 design spreadsheet simplifies this process and \nautomatically recommends a core size and design for either ferrite or \nSendust.\nFor high performance designs, use of Litz wire is recommended to \nreduce copper loss due to skin effect and proximity effect.  For \ntoroidal inductors the numbers of layers should be less than 3 and for \nbobbin wound inductors, inter layer insulation should be used to \nminimize inter layer capacitance.  \nRev. A 06/1514\nPFS7523-7529/7533-7539\nwww.power.com Output Capacitor\nFor a 385 V nominal PFC, use of an electrolytic capacitor with 450 V \nor higher continuous rating is recommended.  The capacitance \nrequired is dependent on the acceptable level of output ripple and \nany hold up time requirements.  The equations below provide an easy \nway to determine the required capacitance in order to meet the \nhold-up time requirement and also to meet the output ripple require- \nments.  The higher of the two values would be required to be used:\ncalculated using the equation:\nCO PFC output capacitance in F.\nPO PFC output power in watts.\ntHOLD-UP Hold-up time specification for the power supply  \n in seconds.\nVOUT Lowest nominal output voltage of the PFC in volts.\nVOUT(MIN)  Lowest permissible output voltage of the PFC at  \n the end of hold-up time in volts.\nCapacitance required for meeting the low frequency ripple specifica -\ntion is calculated using the equation:\n^h\nfL Input frequency in Hz.\nΔVO Peak-peak output voltage ripple in volts.\nηPFC PFC operating efficiency.\nIO(MAX) Maximum output current in amps.\nCapacitance calculated using the above method should be appropri -\nately increased to account for ageing and tolerances.\nPower Supply for the IC\nA 12 V regulated supply should be used for the HiperPFS-3.  If the \nVCC exceeds 15 V, the HiperPFS-3 may be damaged.  In most \napplications a simple series pass linear regulator made using an NPN \ntransistor and Zener diode is adequate since the HiperPFS-3 only \nrequires approximately ICC(ON) maximum for its operation.\nIt is recommended that a 1 µF or larger, low ESR ceramic capacitor \nbe used to decouple the VCC supply.  This capacitor should be placed \ndirectly at the IC pin on the circuit board.\nLine-Sense Network\nThe line-sense network connected to the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin \nprovides input voltage information to the HiperPFS-3.  A value of 16 M Ω \nis chosen in this example design to minimize power consumption in \nthese resistors.  Only 1% tolerance resistors are recommended.\nA decoupling capacitor of 470 pF is required to be connected in \nparallel with the bottom resistor from the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin to \nthe GROUND pin of the HiperPFS-3.  This capacitor should be placed \ndirectly at the IC pin on the circuit board.\nFeedback Network\nA resistor divider network that provides 3.85 V at the FEEDBACK pin at \nthe rated output voltage should be used for optimal performance.  It \nshould be scaled in direct proportion to the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin \nresistor divider network in order to ensure proper regulation and \npower delivery.  The HiperPFS-3 controller has been optimized for \noperation with an output voltage of 385 VDC.  Applications requiring \nvoltages that deviate from this nominal parameter, thereby requiring a FEEDBACK pin divider ratio other than the recommended 100:1, \nneed to be evaluated for trade-offs of the key target parameters of \nthe specific design.  E.g.: the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin divider ratio can \nbe modified to be equivalent to that of the feedback divider in order \nto optimize power factor. However, this will have an impact on power \nlimit, as well as brown-in/brown-out thresholds, etc.  Modification of \nwithin ±10 V of nominal should not result in dramatically compro -\nmised performance, but should be thoroughly verified.  Changes in \nexcess of this are not recommended.  Itemized trade-offs of this type \nare outside the scope of this data sheet.\nThe recommended circuit and the associated component values are \nshown in Figure 14.\nResistors, R1 to R4 comprise of the main output voltage divider \nnetwork.  The sum of resistors R1, R2 and R3 is the upper divider \nresistor and the lower feedback resistor is R4.  Capacitor C1 is to filter \nany switching noise from coupling into the FEEDBACK pin.  Resistor R5, \ncapacitor C2 and C3 is the loop compensation network required to \ntailor the loop response to ensure low cross-over frequency and \nsufficient phase margin.

A 06/1517\nPFS7523-7529/7533-7539\nwww.power.com PCB Design Guidelines and Design Example\nThe line-sense network and the feedback circuit use large resistance \nvalues in order to minimize power dissipation in the feedback network \nand the line-sense network.  Care should be taken to place the \nfeedback circuit and the line-sense network components away from \nthe high-voltage and high current nodes to minimize any interference.  \nAny noise injected in the feedback network or the line-sense network \nwill typically manifest as degradation of power factor.  Excessive \nnoise injection can lead to waveform instability or dissymmetry.\nThe EMI filter components should be clustered together to improve \nfilter effectiveness.  The placement of the EMI filter components on \nthe circuit board should be such that the input circuit is located away \nfrom the drain node of the PFC inductor.\nA filter or decoupling capacitor should be placed at the output of the \nbridge rectifier.  This capacitor together with the X capacitance in the \nEMI filter and the differential inductance of the EMI filter section and \nthe source impedance, works as a filter to reduce the switching \nfrequency current ripple in the input current.  This capacitor also helps \nto minimize the loop area of the switching frequency current loop \nthereby reducing EMI.The connection between the HiperPFS-3 drain node, output diode \ndrain terminal and the PFC inductor should be kept as short as \npossible.\nA low loss ceramic dielectric capacitor should be connected between \nthe cathode of the PFC output diode and the source terminal of the \nHiperPFS-3.  This ensures that the loop area of the loop carrying high \nfrequency currents at the transition of the MOSFET and helps to \nreduce radiated EMI due to the high frequency pulsating nature of \nthe diode current traversing through the loop.\nDuring placement of components on the board, it is best to place the \nvoltage monitor, feedback, reference and bias power decoupling \ncapacitors as close as possible to the pins before the other components \nare placed and routed.  REFERENCE pin decoupling capacitor needs \nto have dedicated return path to GROUND pin.  Failing to do so could \nreduce the noise immunity during surge and ESD test.  Power supply \nreturn trace from the GROUND pin should be separate from the trace \nconnecting the feedback circuit components to the GROUND pin.\nTo minimize the effects of trace impedance on regulation, output \nfeedback should be taken directly from the output capacitor positive \nterminal.  The upper end of the line-sense resistors should be \nconnected to the high frequency filter capacitor connected at the \noutput of the bridge rectifier.\nFigure 18.

A 06/1518\nPFS7523-7529/7533-7539\nwww.power.com Quick Design Checklist\nAs with any power supply design, all HiperPFS-3 designs should be \nverified on the bench to make sure that component specifications are \nnot exceeded under worst-case conditions.  The following minimum \nset of tests is strongly recommended:\n1. Maximum drain voltage – Verify that peak VDS does not exceed \n530 V at lowest input voltage and maximum overload output \npower.  Maximum overload output power occurs when the \noutput is overloaded to a level just above the highest rated load \nor before the power supply output voltage starts falling out of \nregulation.  Additional external snubbers should be used if this \nvoltage is exceeded.  In most designs, addition of a ceramic \ncapacitor in the range of 33 pF and 100 pF connected across the \nPFC output diode will reduce the maximum drain-source voltage \nto a level below the BVDSS rating.  When measuring drain-source \nvoltage of the MOSFET, a high-voltage probe should be used.  \nWhen the probe tip is removed, a silver ring in the vicinity of the \nprobe tip can be seen.  This ring is at ground potential and the \nbest ground connection point for making noise free measure -\nments.  Wrapping stiff wire around the ground ring and then \nconnecting that ground wire into the circuit with the shortest \npossible wire length, and connecting the probe tip to the point \nbeing measured, ensures error free measurement.  Probe should \nbe compensated according to probe manufacturer’s guidelines to \nensure error-free measurement.2.   Maximum drain current – Drain current can be measured \nindirectly by monitoring inductor current.  A current probe \nshould be inserted between the bridge rectifier and inductor \nconnection.  At maximum ambient temperature, minimum input \nvoltage and maximum output load, verify drain current wave -\nforms at start-up for any signs of inductor saturation.  When \nperforming this measurement with Sendust inductor, it is typical \nto see inductor wave-forms that show exponential increase in \ncurrent due to permeability drop.  This should not be confused \nwith hard saturation. \n3.   Thermal check – At maximum output power, minimum input \nvoltage and maximum ambient temperature; verify that \ntemperature specifications are not exceeded for the HiperPFS-3, \nPFC inductor, output diodes and output capacitors.  Enough \nthermal margin should be allowed for the part-to-part variation \nof the RDS(ON) of HiperPFS-3, as specified in the data sheet.  A \nmaximum package temperature of 100 °C is recommended to \nallow for these variations.\n4.   Input PF should improve with load, if performance is found to \nprogressively deteriorate with loading, it is a sign of possible \nnoise pick-up by the VOLTAGE MONITOR pin circuit or the \nfeedback divider network and the compensation circuit.\nRev.
