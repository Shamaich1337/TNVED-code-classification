The o utput common -mode level can easily  be \nmatched to the required ADC input common -mode levels. The \ninternal common -mode feedback loop provides exceptional  output  \nbalance and suppression of even -order distortion products.  \nDifferential gain configurations are easily realized using a n \nexternal feedback network compris ing four resistors. The \ncurrent feedback architecture provides loop gain that is nearly indepe ndent of closed -loop gain, achieving wide bandwidth, \nlow distortion, and low noise at higher gains and lower power consumption than comparable voltage feedback amplifiers . \nThe ADA4927 is fabricated using the Analog Devices, Inc., \nsilicon -germanium  compleme ntary bipolar process, enabling \nvery low levels of distortion with an input voltage noise of only 1.3 nV/√Hz.

At approximately 150°C, which is the glass transition \ntemperature, the plastic changes the  properties. Even \ntemporarily exceeding this temp erature limit can change the \nstresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting \nthe parametric performanc e of the ADA4927 . Exceeding a \njunction temperature  of 150°C for an extended period can result \nin changes in the silicon devices, potentially causing failure.  The power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the package due to the load drive. The quiescent power is the voltage between the supply pins (V\nS) times the quiescen t current (I S). \nThe power dissipated due to the load drive depends upon the \nparticular application. The power due to load drive is calculated \nby multiplying the load current by the associated voltage drop \nacross the device. RMS voltages and currents must b e used in \nthese calculations.  \nAirflow increases heat dissipation, effectively reducing θ JA. In \naddition, more metal directly in contact with the package leads/  \nexposed pad from metal traces, throughholes, ground, and power \nplanes reduces θ JA. \nFigure 4 shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage  vs. the ambient temperature for the single 1 6-lead LFCSP \n(87°C/W ) and  the dual 24- lead LFCSP (47 °C/W) on a JEDEC \nstandard  \n4-layer board  with the exposed pad soldered to a PCB pad that \nis connected to a solid plane . \n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n–40 –20 0 20 40\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)60 80 100MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)\n07574-003ADA4927-2\nADA4927-1\n \nFigure 4.

B | Page 17 of 25 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADA4927 differs from conventional operational amplifiers \nin that it has two outputs whose voltages move in opposite directions and an additional input, V\nOCM. Moreover, the ADA4927 \nuses a current feedback architecture. Like a traditional current \nfeedback operational amplifier, the ADA4927 relies on high \nopen-loop trans-impedance, T(s), and negative current feedback to force the outputs to the desired voltages. The ADA4927 behaves much like a standard current feedback operational amplifier and facilitates single-ended-to-differential conversions, common-mode \nlevel shifting, and amplifications of differential signals. Also, like \na current feedback operational amplifier, the ADA4927 has low input impedance summing nodes, which are actually emitter-follower outputs. The ADA4927 outputs are low impedance, and the closed-loop output impedances are equal to the open-loop output impedances divided by a factor of 1 + loop gain. Because \nit uses current feedback, the ADA4927 manifests a nominally \nconstant feed-back resistance, bandwidth product. In other words, the closed-loop bandwidth and stability of the ADA4927 depend primarily on the feedback resistor value. The closed-loop gain equations for typical configurations are the same as \nthose of comparable voltage feedback differential amplifiers. \nThe chief difference is that the ADA4927 dynamic performance depends on the feed-back resistor value rather than on the noise gain. Because of this, the elements used in the feedback loops must be resistive with values that ensure stability and sufficient bandwidth. \nTwo feedback loops are employed to control the differential and \ncommon-mode output voltages. The differential feedback loops \nuse a current feedback architecture with external resistors and control only the differential output voltage. The common-mode feedback loop is internal, uses voltage feedback, and controls only the common-mode output voltage. This architecture makes it \neasy to set the output common-mode level to any arbitrary \nvalue within the specified limits. The output common-mode voltage is forced, by the internal common-mode loop, to be  \nequal to the voltage applied to the V\nOCM input. \nThe internal common-mode feedback loop produces outputs \nthat are highly balanced over a wide frequency range without requiring tightly matched external components. This results  \nin differential outputs that are very close to the ideal of being \nidentical in amplitude and are exactly 180° apart in phase.

Circuit Definitions \nDifferential Voltage  \nDifferential voltage refers to the difference between two  \nnode voltages. For example, the output differential voltage (or \nequivalently, output differential-mode voltage) is defined as \nVOUT, dm  = (V+OUT − V −OUT) \nwhere  V+OUT and V−OUT refer to the voltages at the +OUT and \n−OUT terminals with respect to a common ground reference. \nSimilarly, the differential input voltage is defined as \nVIN, dm = (+D IN − (−D IN)) \nCommon-Mode Voltage  \nCommon-mode voltage refers to the average of two node voltages \nwith respect to the local ground reference. The output \ncommon-mode voltage is defined as \nVOUT, cm  = (V+OUT + V−OUT)/2 \nBalance  \nOutput balance is a measure of how close the differential signals \nare to being equal in amplitude and opposite in phase. Output \nbalance is most easily determined by placing a well-matched \nresistor divider between the differential voltage nodes and \ncomparing the magnitude of the signal at the divider midpoint with the magnitude of the differential signal (see Figure 44). By this definition, output balance is the magnitude of the output common-mode voltage divided by the magnitude of the output differential mode voltage.  \ndm OUTcm OUT\nVV\nError Balance Output\n,,\n\uf044\uf044\n\uf03d  \n \n \nADA4927- 1/ADA4927- 2 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 18 of 25 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nANALYZING AN APPLICA TION CIRCUIT  \nThe ADA4927 uses high open -loop transimpedance and negative  \ncurrent feedback to control  the differential output voltage in \nsuch a way as to minimize the differential error currents. The \ndifferential error currents are defined as the currents that flow in and out of the differential inputs labeled +IN and −IN (see \nFigure 46). For most purposes, these currents can be assumed \nto be zero. The voltage between the +IN and −IN inputs is \ninternally bootstrapped to 0 V ; therefore , the voltages at the \namplifier inputs are equal, and external analysis can be carried \nout in a similar fashion to that of voltage feedback  amplifiers . \nSimilarly, the difference between the actual output common -\nmode voltage and the voltage applied to V\nOCM can also be assumed  \nto be zero. Starting from these principles , any application circuit \ncan be analyzed.  \nSETTING THE CLOSED -LOOP GAIN  \nUsing the approach previously described, the differential gain of \nthe circuit in Figure 46 can be determined by  \nGF\ndmINdm OUT\nRR\nVV\n=\n,, \nThis presumes that the input resistors (R G) and feedback \nresistors (R F) on each side are of equal  value .  \n ESTIMATING THE OUTPU T NOISE VOLTAGE  \nThe differential output noise of the ADA4927 can be estimated \nusing the noise model in Figure 47. The input -referred noise \nvoltage density, v nIN, is modeled as a differential input, and the \nnoise currents, i nIN− and i nIN+, appear between each input and \nground. The output voltage due to v nIN is obtained by multiplying \nvnIN by the noise gain, G N (defined in the GN equation ). The \nnoise currents are uncorrelated with the same mean -square value, \nand each produce s an output voltage  that is equal to the noise \ncurrent multiplied by the associated feedback  resistance . The \nnoise voltage density at the V OCM pin is v nCM. When the feedback \nnetworks have the same feedback factor , as in most cases, the \noutput noise due to v nCM is common mode. Each of the four \nresistors contributes (4kTR xx)1/2. The noise from the feedback \nresistors appears directly at the output, and the noise from each  \ngain resistor  appears at the output multiplied by R F/RG.

The amplitudes \nof the signals at each output remain equal and 180 ° out of phase. \nThe input -to-output differential mode gain varies proportionately  \nto the feedback mismatch, but the output balance is unaffected.  \nThe gain from the V OCM pin to V O, dm is equal to   \n2(β1 − β2)/ (β1 + β2) \nWhen β1 = β2 , this term goes to zero and there is no differential \noutput voltage due to the voltage on the V OCM input (including \nnoise). The extreme case occurs when one loop is open and the \nother has 100% feedback; in this case, the gain from V OCM input \nto V O, dm is either +2 or −2, depending on which loop is closed.   The feedback loops are nominally matched to wi thin 1% in \nmost applications, and the output noise and offsets due to the \nVOCM input are negligible. If the loops are intentionally mismatched \nby a large amount, it is necessary to include the gain term from V\nOCM to V O, dm and account for the extra noise. For example, if \nβ1 = 0.5 and β2 = 0.25, the gain from VOCM to V O, dm is 0.67. If the \nVOCM pin is set to 2.5 V , a differential offset voltage is present at the \noutput of (2.5  V)(0.67) = 1.67 V . The differential output noise \ncontribution is (15 nV/√Hz)(0.67) = 10 nV/√Hz. Both of these \nresults are undesirable in most applications; therefore, it is best to use nominally matched feedback factors.  \nMismatched feedback networks also result in a degradation of \nthe ability of the circuit to reject input common -mode s ignals,  \nmuch the same as for a four -resistor difference amplifier made \nfrom a conventional op erational amplifier .  \nAs a practical summarization of the previous  issues, resistors of \n1% tolerance produce a worst -case input CMRR of approximately  \n40 dB, a wors t-case differential -mode output offset of 25 mV \ndue to a 2.5 V V\nOCM input, negligible V OCM noise contribution, \nand no significant degradation in output balance error.  \nCALCULATING THE INPU T IMPEDANCE FOR AN \nAPPLICATION CIRCUIT  \nThe effective input impedance of a circuit depends on whether the amplifier is being driven by a single -ended or differential \nsignal source. For balanced differential input signals, as shown in Figure 48, the input impedance (R\nIN, dm) between the inputs \n(+D IN and −D IN) is simply R IN, dm = RG + R G = 2 × R G. \n+VS\n–VSADA4927+IN\n–INRF\nRF+DIN\n–DINVOCMRG\nRGVOUT, dm\n07574-048 \nFigure 48.

The ADA4927  with Unbalanced (Single- Ended) Input  \nThe input impedance of the circuit is effectively higher than it \nwould be for a conventional operational amplifier  connected as \nan inverter because a fraction of the differential output voltage appears at the inputs as a common -mode signal, partially boot -\nstrapping the voltage across the input resistor R\nG. The common -\nmode voltage at the amplifier input terminals can be easily \ndetermined by noting that the voltage at the inv erting input is equal \nto the non inverting output voltage divided down by the voltage \ndivide r formed by R F and R G in the lower loop. This voltage is \npresent at both input terminals due to negative voltage feedback and is in phase with the input signal, thus  reducing the effective \nvoltage across R\nG in the upper loop and partially bootstrapping R G. \nTerminating a Single -Ended Input  \nThis section deals with how to properly terminate a single -\nended input to the ADA4927  with a gain of 1 , RF = 348 Ω, and \nRG = 348 Ω. An example using an input source with a terminated  \noutput voltage of 1  V p-p and a source resistance  of 50  Ω illustrates  \nthe four simple steps that must be followed. Note that, because  \nthe terminated output voltage of the source is 1 V  p-p, the open \ncircuit output voltage of the source is 2 V p -p. The source shown \nin Figure 50 indicates this  open -circuit voltage.  \n1.

Thevenin Equivalent and Matched Gain Resistors  \nFigure 53 presents a tractable circuit with matched \nfeedback loops that can be easily evaluated. \nIt is useful to point out two effects that occur with a \nterminated input. The first is that the value of R G is increased \nin both loops, lowering the overall closed-loop gain. The \nsecond is that V TH is a little larger than 1 V p-p, as it is \nwhen  R T = 50 Ω. These two effects have opposite impacts \non the output voltage, and for large resistor values in the \nfeedback loops (~1 kΩ), the effects essentially cancel each other out. For small R\nF and R G, or high gains, however, the \ndiminished closed-loop gain is not canceled completely by the \nincreased V TH. This can be seen by evaluating Figure 53. \nThe desired differential output in this example is 1 V p-p \nbecause the terminated input signal is 1 V p-p and the closed-loop gain = 1. The actual differential output voltage, however, is equal to (1.06 V p-p)(348/374.7) = 0.984 V p-p. To obtain the desired output voltage of 1 V p-p, a final gain adjustment \ncan be made by increasing R\nF without modifying any of the \ninput circuitry. This is discussed in Step 4. \n4. The feedback resistor value is modified as a final gain \nadjustment to obtain the desired output voltage.  \nTo make the output voltage V OUT = 1 V p-p, R F must be \ncalculated using the following formula:  \n\uf028\uf029 \uf028\uf029 \uf028\uf029 \uf028\uf0293506 . 1Ω 374.7 1,\uf03d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf02b\uf03d\np p Vp p V\nVR R V DesiredR\nTHTS G dm OUTF\n \nThe closest standard 1% values to 353 Ω are 348 Ω and 357 Ω. Choosing 357 Ω for R\nF gives a differential output \nvoltage of 1.01 V p-p. The closed-loop bandwidth is \ndiminished by a factor of  approximately 348/357 from \nwhat it would be with R F = 348 Ω due to the inversely \nproportional relationship between R F and closed-loop  \ngain that is characteristic of  current feedba ck amplifiers. \nThe final circuit is shown in Figure 54.

Terminated Single-Ende d-to-Differential System with G = 1 \nINPUT COMMON-MODE VOLTAGE RANGE  \nThe ADA4927 input common-mode range is centered between the two supply rails, in contrast to other ADC drivers with level-shifted \ninput ranges, such as the ADA4937. The centered input common-mode range is best suited to ac-c oupled, differential-to-differential, \nand dual supply applications. \nFor operation with ±5 V supplies, the input common-mode \nrange at the summing nodes of the amplifier is specified as −3.5 V to +3.5 V and is specified as +1.3 V to +3.7 V with a single +5 V supply. To avoid nonlinearities, the voltage swing  at the +IN and −IN terminals must be confined to these ranges. \nINPUT AND OUTPUT CAPACITIVE AC COUPLING \nInput ac coupling capacitors can be inserted between the source \nand R G. This ac coupling blocks the flow of the dc common-\nmode feedback current and causes the ADA4927 dc input \ncommon-mode voltage to equal the dc output common-mode voltage. These ac coupling capacitors must be placed in both \nloops to keep the feedback factors matched. \nOutput ac coupling capacitors can be placed in series between \neach output and respective load. See Figure 58 for an example that uses input and output capacitive ac coupling. \nSETTING THE OUTPUT COMMON-MODE VOLTAGE  \nThe V OCM pin of the ADA4927 is internally biased with a voltage \ndivider comprising two 10 kΩ resistors at a voltage approximately \nequal to the midsupply point, [(+V S) + (−V S)]/2. Because of this \ninternal divider, the V OCM pin sources and sinks current, depending \non the externally applied voltage and associated source resistance. \nRelying on the internal bias results in an output common-mode voltage that is within about 100 mV of the expected value.  \nIn cases where accurate control of the output common-mode level \nis required, it is recommended that an external source or resistor divider be used with source resistance less than 100 Ω. The output common-mode offset listed in the Specifications section presumes \nthat the V\nOCM input is driven by a low impedance voltage source.  \nIt is also possible to connect the V OCM input to a common-mode \nlevel (CML) output of an ADC; however, care must be taken to \nensure that the output has sufficient drive capability. The input impedance of the V\nOCM pin is approximately 10 kΩ. If multiple \nADA4927 devices share one ADC reference output, a buffer may \nbe necessary to drive the parallel inputs. \nADA4927- 1/ADA4927- 2 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

B | Page 23 of 25 LAYOUT, GROUNDING, A ND BYPASSING  \nAs a high speed device , the AD A4927 is sensitive to the PCB \nenvironment in which it operates. Realizing  the superior \nperformance  requires attention to the details of high speed \nPCB design. This section show s a detailed example of  how the \nADA4927- 1 was addressed.  \nThe first requirement i s a solid ground plane that covers as \nmuch of the board area around the ADA4927- 1 as possible. \nHowever, clear the area near the feedback resistors (RF), gain \nresistors (RG), and the input summing nodes (Pin 2 and  Pin 3) of \nall ground and power planes (see  Figure 55). Clearing the ground \nand power planes  minimizes any stray capacitance at these nodes \nand prevents peaking of the response of the amplifier  at high \nfrequencies . Whereas  ideal current feedback  amplifiers are \ninsensitive to summing node capacitance, real -world amplifiers \ncan exhibit peaking due to excessive summing node capacitance.  \nThe thermal resistance, θ JA, is specified for the device, including \nthe exposed pad, soldered to a high thermal co nductivity 4-layer  \ncircuit board, as described in EIA/JESD  51-7. \n07574-055 \nFigure 55.

The 1000 pF capacitor should be placed closer to the device. Further away, provide low frequency bulk bypassing, \nusing 10 µF tantalum capacitors from each supply to ground.  \nMake s ignal routing short and direct to avoid parasitic effects. \nWherever complementary signals exist, provide a symmetrical \nlayout to maximize balanced performance. When routing differential signals over a long distance, place PCB traces  close \ntogether, and twist any differential wiring such that the loop \narea is minimized. Doing this reduces radiated energy and makes the circuit less susceptible to interference.  \n1.30\n0.80\n0.80 1.30\n07574-056 \nFigure 56.

B | Page 24 of 25 HIGH PERFORMANCE ADC  DRIVING  \nThe ADA4927 is ideally suited for high gain, broadband ac-\ncoupled and differential -to-differential applications on a single \nsupply , though other applications are possib le. Compared with \nvoltage f eedback amplifiers, the current feedback architecture \nprovides superior distortion and bandwidth performance at \nhigh gains . This is because the ideal current feedback amplifier \nloop gain depends only on the feedback value and ope n-loop \ntransimpedance , T(s).  \nThe circuit in Figure 58 shows a fro nt-end connection for an \nADA4927 driving an AD9445, 14 -bit, 105 MSPS ADC, with ac  \ncoupling on the ADA4927 input and output. ( The AD9445 \nachieves optimum performance when driven differentially. ) The \nADA4927 eliminates the need for a transformer to drive  \nthe ADC and performs a single -ended -to-differential conversion  \nand buffering of the driving signal.  \nThe ADA4927 is configured with a sin gle 5 V supply and gain \nof 10 for a single -ended input to differential output. The 158 Ω \ntermination resistor, in parallel with the single -ended input \nimpedance of approximately 73.2 Ω, provides a 50  Ω termination  \nfor the source. The additional 38.3 Ω at the inverting input closely  \nmatches  the parallel impedance of the 50  Ω source and the \ntermination resistor driving the noninverting input.  Because of the \nhigh gain, a few iterations of the termination technique described  \nin the Terminating a Single -Ended Input  section are required. \nTwo objectives of the design are  to make R F close to 500 Ω and \nobtain resistor values that are  close to standard 1% values.   In this  example , the signal generator has a 1 V p -p symmetric, \nground -referenced bipolar output  when terminated in 50 Ω . \nThe V OCM pin of the ADA4927 is bypassed for noise reduction \nand left floating such that the internal divider set s the output \ncommon -mode voltage nominally at midsupply. Because the \ninputs are ac -coupled, no dc common -mode current flows in \nthe feed back loops, and a nominal dc level of midsupply  is \npresent at the amplifier input terminals . Besides placing the \namplifier inputs at their optimum levels, t he ac coupling  technique \nlightens the load on the amplifier and dissipates less power than \napplications with dc -coupled inputs.  \nThe output of the amplifier is ac -coupled to the ADC through a \nsecond -order, low -pass filter with a cutoff frequency of  100 MHz.  \nThis reduces the noise bandwidth of the amplifier and isolates \nthe driver outputs from the ADC inputs.  \nThe AD9445 is configured for a 2 V p -p full -scale input by \nconnecting the SENSE pin to AGND, as sh own in Figure 58. \nVIN–\nVIN+47pF30nH\n30nH24.3Ω\n24.3Ω50Ω\nSIGNAL\nGENERATOR39.2Ω39.2Ω\nVOCM5V\nADA4927+\n158Ω\n511Ω38.3Ω511Ω\n14BUFFER T/H\nADC\nCLOCK/\nTIMINGREF\nSENSE AGND0.1µF 0.1µF\n0.1µF 0.1µF 0.1µFAD94453.3V (A)\nAVDD15V (A)\nAVDD23.3V (D)\nDRVDD\n07574-058 \nFigure 58.
