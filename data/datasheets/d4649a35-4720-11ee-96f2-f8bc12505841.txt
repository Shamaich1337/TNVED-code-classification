General description\nThe 74AXP1T45 is a single bit, dual supply transceiver with 3-state output that enables\nbidirectional level translation. It features two 1-bit input-output ports (A and B), a direction control\ninput (DIR) and dual supply pins (V CC(A)  and V CC(B) ). Both V CC(A)  and V CC(B)  can be supplied at any\nvoltage between 0.9 V and 5.5 V making the device suitable for translating between any of the low\nvoltage nodes (0.9 V, 1.2 V, 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V and 5.0 V). No power supply sequencing is\nrequired and output glitches during power supply transitions are prevented using patented circuitry.\nAs a result glitches will not appear on the outputs for supply transitions during power-up/down\nbetween 20 mV/μs and 5.5 V/s. Pins A and DIR are referenced to V CC(A)  and pin B is referenced\nto V CC(B) . A HIGH on DIR allows transmission from A to B and a LOW on DIR allows transmission\nfrom B to A.\nThe device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing any damaging backflow current through the device when it is\npowered down. In suspend mode when either V CC(A)  or V CC(B)  are at GND level, both A and B are\nin the high-impedance OFF-state.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range:\n•VCC(A) : 0.9 V to 5.5 V\n•VCC(B) : 0.9 V to 5.5 V\n•Low input capacitance; C I = 1.5 pF (typical)\n•Low output capacitance; C O = 3.8 pF (typical)\n•Low dynamic power consumption; C PD = 11 pF (typical)\n•Low static power consumption; I CC = 2 μA (25 °C maximum)\n•High noise immunity\n•Complies with JEDEC standard:\n•JESD8-12 (1.1 V to 1.3 V; inputs)\n•JESD8-11 (1.4 V to 1.6 V)\n•JESD8-7 (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n•JESD8-5 (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•JESD12-6 (4.5 V to 5.5 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-001 class 2 exceeds 2 kV\n•CDM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-002 class C3 exceeds 1 kV\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD78D Class II\n•Inputs accept voltages up to 5.5 V\n•Low noise overshoot and undershoot < 10% of V CCO\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial power-down mode operation\n•Specified from -40 °C to +125 °C\nNexperia 74AXP1T45\n1-bit dual supply translating transceiver; 3-state\n3.

Bidirectional logic level-shifting application\nFig. 16  shows the 74AXP1T45 being used in a bidirectional logic level-shifting application.

The bus-line state\ndepends on bus hold.\n3 L Z Z DIR bit is set LOW. I/O-1 and I/O-2 still are disabled.\nThe bus-line state depends on bus hold.\n4 L input output system-2 data to system-1\n12.3.  Enable times\nCalculate the enable times for the 74AXP1T45 using the following formulas:\n•Direction A to B:\n•tPZL (DIR to B) = t PHL (A to B) + t PHZ (DIR to A)\n•tPZH (DIR to B) = t PLH (A to B) + t PLZ (DIR to A)\n•Direction B to A:\n•tPZL (DIR to A) = t PHL (B to A) + t PHZ (DIR to B)\n•tPZH (DIR to A) = t PLH (B to A) + t PLZ (DIR to B)\nIn a bidirectional application, these enable times provide the maximum delay from the time\nthe DIR bit is switched until an output is expected. For example, if the 74AXP1T45 initially is\ntransmitting from A to B, then the DIR bit is switched, the B port of the device must be disabled\nbefore presenting it with an input. After the B port has been disabled, an input signal applied to it\nappears on the corresponding A port after the specified propagation delay.\n74AXP1T45 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2020.
