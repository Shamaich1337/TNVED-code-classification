The user has to ensure \nwatchdog reset within the watchdog timeout period, otherwise the watchdog output is \nasserted and the MCU is restarted. The STWD100 can also be enabled or disabled by the \nchip enable pin.  \n3.1 Watchdog input (WDI)  \nThe WDI input has to be toggled within the watchdog timeout period, t WD, otherwise the \nwatchdog output, WDO  , is asserted. The internal watchdog timer, wh ich counts the t WD \nperiod, is cleared as follows:  \n1. by a transition on the watchdog output, WDO  (see Figure 8: "Timeout without  \nre-trigger" ) or  \n2. by a pulse on the enable pin, EN (see Figure 10: "Enable pin, EN, triggering" ) or  \n3. by toggling the WDI input (low -to-high on all versions and high -to-low on the \nSTWD100xW, STWD100xX and STWD100xY only).  \nThe pulses on the WDI input with a duration of at least 1 µs are detected and glitches \nshorter than 100 ns are ignored.  \nIf the WDI is permanently tied high or low and EN is tied low, the WDO  toggles every \n3.4 ms (t WD) on the STWD100xP and every t WD and t PW on the STWD100xW, STWD100xX  \nand STWD100xY (see Figure 8: "Timeout without re -trigger" ). \n3.2 Watchdog output ( WDO ) \nWhen the V CC exceeds the timer startup voltage, V START , after power -up, the internal \nwatchdog timer starts counting. If the timer is not cleared within the t WD, the WDO  goes \nlow (see Figure 6: "Power -up"). \nAfter exceeding the t WD, the WDO  is asserted for t PW on STWD100xW, STWD100xX and \nSTWD100xY regardless of possible WDI transitions (see Figure 9: "Trigger after timeout" ). \nOn the STWD100xP, WDO  is asser ted for a minimum of 10 µs and a maximum of t WD \nafter exceeding the t WD period (see Figure 8: "Timeout without re -trigger"  and Figure 9: \n"Trigger after timeout" ). \nThe STWD100 has an active l ow open drain or push -pull output. An external pull -up \nresistor connected to any supply voltage up to 6 V is required in case of an open drain \nWDO  output (see Figure 4: "Open drain WDO output conn ection" ). Select a resistor \nvalue large enough to register a logic low, and small enough to register a logic high while \nsupplying all input current and leakage paths connected to the reset output line. A 10 kΩ \npull-up resistor is sufficient in most applica tions.  \nOperation  STWD100  \n \n6/20 DocID14134  Rev 11  \n \n \nFigure 4: Open drain WDO output connection  \n \n \n3.3 Chip enable input ( EN) \nAll states mentioned in Section 3.1: "Watchdog input (WDI)"  and Section 3.2: "Watchdog \noutput ( WDO )" are valid under the condition that EN is in logical low state . \nThe behavior of EN is common to all versions (i.e. STWD100xP, STWD100xW, \nSTWD100xX and STWD100xY).  \nIf the EN goes high after power -up, in less than t WD from the moment that V CC exceeds \nthe timer startup voltage, V START , the WDO  stays high for the same time period as EN , \nplus t WD (see Figure 10: "Enable pin, EN, triggering" ). \nIf the EN goes high anytime during normal operation, the WDO   goes high as well, but \nthe minimum possible WDO  pulse width is 10 µs (see Figure 10: "Enable pin, EN, \ntriggering" ). \nPulses on the EN pin with a duration of at least 1 µ s are detected and glitches shorter \nthan 100 ns are ignored.  \n  \n\nSTWD100  Operation  \n \n DocID14134  Rev 11 7/20 \n \n \n3.4 Applications information  \nInterfacing to microprocessors with bidirectional reset pins  \nMicroprocessors with bidirectional reset pins can contend with the STWD100 watchdog \noutput, WDO  . For example, if the WDO  output is driven high and the micro wants to \npull it low, signal contention is the result. To prevent this  from occurring, connect a 4.7 kΩ \nresistor between the WDO  output and the microprocessors reset I/O as in Figure 5: \n"Interfacing to microprocessors with bidirectional reset I/O" . \nFigure 5: Interfacing to microprocessors with bidirectional reset I/O  \n \n \n\nWatchdog  timing  STWD100  \n \n8/20 DocID14134  Rev 11  \n \n4 Watchdog timing  \nFigure 6: Power -up \n \n \n\nSTWD100  Watchdog  timing  \n \n DocID14134  Rev 11 9/20 \n \n \nFigure 7: Normal  triggering  \n \n \nFigure 8: Timeout without re -trigger  \n \n \n \n \n\nWatchdog  timing  STWD100  \n \n10/20 DocID14134  Rev 11  \n \n \nFigure 9: Trigger after timeout  \n \n \n \nFigure 10: Enable pin, EN, triggering  \n \n \n \n\nSTWD100  Maximum  ratings  \n \n DocID14134  Rev 11 11/20 \n \n5 Maximum ratings  \nStressing the device above the ratings listed in Table 2: "Absolute maximum ratings"  may \ncause permanent damage to the device.

#### Description:
The **STWD100** is a watchdog timer circuit designed to monitor the operation of microcontrollers (MCUs) and other digital systems. Its primary function is to prevent system failures caused by hardware or software errors by ensuring that the system resets if it becomes unresponsive. The device features a watchdog input (WDI) that must be toggled within a specified timeout period to reset the internal timer. If the timer is not reset, the watchdog output (WDO) is asserted, signaling a system alert or triggering a reset.

#### Typical Applications:
The STWD100 is suitable for a variety of applications, including:
- **Telecommunications**: Ensuring reliable operation of communication devices.
- **Alarm Systems**: Monitoring system integrity and responsiveness.
- **Industrial Equipment**: Maintaining operational reliability in industrial automation.
- **Networking**: Ensuring continuous operation of network devices.
- **Medical Equipment**: Monitoring critical systems to prevent failures.
- **Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)**: Ensuring system reliability during power interruptions.
- **Automotive**: Used in automotive applications where system reliability is critical.

This component is particularly valuable in systems where failure to respond could lead to significant issues, making it an essential part of safety and reliability in electronic designs.
