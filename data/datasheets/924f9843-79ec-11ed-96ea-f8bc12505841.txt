They have \na bandwidth and slew rate typically found in current feedback amplifiers. All have a wide input common -mode voltage range \nand output voltage swing, making them easy to use on single \nsupplies as low as 2.7 V . \nDespite being low cost, the AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 provide \nexcellent overall performance. For video applications, their differential gain and phase errors are 0.01% and 0.04° into a 150 Ω load, along with 0.1 dB flatness out to 30 MHz. Addi -\ntionally, they offer wide bandwidth to 300 MHz along with 650 V/µs slew rate.  \nThe AD8061/ AD8062/ AD8063 offer a typical low power of  \n6.8 mA/amplifier, while being capable of delivering up to \n50 mA of lo ad current. The AD8063 has a power -down disable \nfeature that reduces the supply current to 400 µA. These features \nmake the AD8063 ideal for portable and battery -powered \napplications where size and power are critical.  \n \nAD8061/AD8062/AD8063 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Exposure to absolute \nmaximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.  MAXIMUM POWER DISSIP ATION  \nThe maximum power that can be safely dissipated by the AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 is limited by the associated rise in \njunction temperature. The maximum safe junction temperature for plastic encapsulated devices is determined by the glass transition temperature of the plastic, approximately 150 °C. \nTemporarily exceeding this limit may cause a shift in  parametric \nperfo rmance due to a change in the stresses exerted on the die \nby the package. Exceeding a junction temperature of 175 °C for \nan extended period can result in device failure. While the AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 is internally short -circuit protected, \nthis may not be s ufficient to guarantee that the maxi mum \njunction temperature (150° C) is not exceeded under  all \nconditions.  \nTo ensure proper operation, it is necessary to observe the maximum power derating curves.  \nAMBIENT TEMPER ATURE (°C)2.0\n1.0\n0\n–50 –40MAXIMUM POWER DISSI PATION (W)\n–30 70 80 901.5\n0.5\n60 50 40 30 0 –10 –20 20 10TJ = 150°C\nMSO P\nSOT-23-5, SO T-23-68-LEAD SOIC\nPACKAGE\n01065-006\n \nFigure 6.

J | Page 14 of 20 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 family is comprised of high \nspeed voltage feedbac k op amps. The high slew rate input stage \nis a true, single -supply topology, capable of sensing signals at or \nbelow the minus supply rail. The rail- to-rail output stage can \npull within 30 mV of either supply rail when driving light loads and within 0.3 V w hen driving 1 50 Ω. High speed perform -\nance  is maintained at supply voltages as low as 2.7  V. \nHEADROOM CONSIDERATI ONS  \nThese amplifiers are designed for use in low voltage systems. To obtain optimum performance, it is useful to understand the \nbehavior of the amplifier as  input and output signals approach \nthe amplifier’s headroom limits.  \nThe AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 input common -mode voltage \nrange extends from  the negative supply voltage (actually  200 mV \nbelow this), or ground for single -supply operation, to within  \n1.8 V of t he positive supply voltage. Thus, at a gain of 2, the \nAD8061/AD8062/AD8063 can provide full rail -to-rail output \nswing for supply voltage as low as 3.6 V , assuming the input signal swings from −V\nS (or ground) to +V S/2. At a gain of 3,  \nthe AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 can provide a rail -to-rail output \nrange down to 2.7 V total supply voltage.  \nExceeding the headroom limit is not a concern for any inverting gain on any supply voltage, as long as the refer ence voltage at \nthe amplifier’s positive input lies within the amplifier’s input \ncommon -mode range.  \nThe input stage is the headroom limit for signals when the \namplifier is used in a gain of 1 for signals approaching the positive rail. Figure 45 shows a t ypical offset voltage vs. input \ncommon -mode voltage for the AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 \namplifier on a  5 V supply. Accurate dc performance is main -\ntained from approxi mately 200 mV below the minus supply  \nto within 1.8  V of the positive s upply. For high speed signals, \nhowever, there are other considerations. Figure 46 shows −3 dB \nbandwidth vs. dc input voltage for a unity -gain follower. As  \nthe common -mode voltage approaches the positive supply,  \nthe amplifier ho lds together well, but the bandwidth begins to \ndrop  at 1.9 V within +V\nS. \nThis manifests itself in increased distortion or settling time. \nFigure 16 plots the distortion of a 1 V p -p signal with the \nAD8061/AD8062/AD8063 amplifier us ed as a follower on  \na 5 V supply vs. signal common -mode voltage. Distortion \nperformance is maintained until the input signal center voltage \ngets beyond 2.5  V , as the peak of the input sine wave begins to \nrun into the  upper common -mode voltage limit.

Unity -Gain Follower Bandwidth vs. Input Common Mode, V S = 5 V  \nHigher frequency signals require more headroom than lower frequencies to maintain dis tortion performance. Figure 47 \nillustrates how the rising edge settling time for the amplifier configured as a unity -gain follower stretches out as the top of \na 1 V step input approaches and exceeds the specified input \ncommon -mode  voltage limit.  \nFor signals approaching the minus supply and inverting gain \nand high positive gain configurations, the headroom limit is \nthe output stage. The AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 amplifiers use \na common emitter style output stage. This output stage maximi zes the available output range, limited by the saturation \nvoltage of the output transistors. The saturation voltage increases with the drive current the output transistor is required \nto supply, due to the output transistors’ collector resistance. The \nsatur ation voltage is estimated using the equation  \nV\nSAT = 25 mV + I O × 8 Ω \nwhere : \nIO is the output current.  \n8 Ω is a typical value for the output transistors’ collector resistance. \nData Sheet  AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 \n \nRev.

Output Rising Edge for 1 V Step at  \nInput  Headroom Limits, G = 1, V S = 5 V, 0 V  \nAs the saturation point of the output stage is approached, the \noutput signal shows increasing amounts of compression and clipping. As in the input headroom case, the higher frequency signals require a bit more headroo m than lower frequency \nsignals. Figure 16, Figure 17, and Figure 18 illustrate this point, \nplotting typical distortion vs. output amplitude and bias for gains of 2 and 5.  \nOVERLOA D BEHAVIOR AND RECOVERY  \nInput  \nThe specified input common -mode voltage of the AD8061/ \nAD8062/AD8063 is −200 mV below the negative supply to \nwithin 1.8 V of the  positive supply. Exceeding the top limit \nresults in lower bandwidth and increased settling time a s seen \nin Figure 46 and Figure 47. Pushing the input voltage of a unity -\ngain follower beyond 1.6 V within the positive supply leads to \nthe behavior shown in Figure 48—an increasi ng amount of \noutput error and  much increased settling time. Recovery time \nfrom input voltages 1.6 V or closer to the positive supply is \napproxi mately 35  ns, which is limited by the settling artifacts \ncaused by transistors in the input stage coming out of saturation.  \nThe AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 family does not exhibit phase \nreversal, even for input voltages beyond the voltage supply rails. \nGoing more than  0.6 V beyond the power supplies turn s on \nprotection diodes at the input stage, which greatly increase s the \ncurrent draw  of the device.

J | Page 16 of 20 CAPACITIVE LOAD DRIV E \nThe AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 family is optimized for \nbandwidth and speed, not for driving capacitive loads. Output \ncapacitance creates a pole in the amplifier’s feedback path, \nleading to excessive peaking and potential oscillatio n. If dealing \nwith load capacitance is a requirement of the application, the two strategies to consider are as follows:  \nUse a small resistor in series with the amplifier’s output and the \nload capacitance.  \nReduce the bandwidth of the amplifier’s feedback lo op by \nincreasing the overall noise gain.  \nFigure 50 shows a unity -gain follower using the series resistor \nstrategy. The resistor isolates the output from the capacitance and, more importantly, creates a zero in the feedback path that compensates for the pole created by the output capacitance.  \nAD8061 VORSERIES\nCLOADVIN\n01065-050 \nFigure 50. Series Resistor Isolating Capacitive Load  \nVoltage feedback amplifiers like those in the AD8061/AD8062/  \nAD8063 family are able to drive more capacitive load  without \nexcessive peaking when used in higher gain configurations  \nbecause the increased noise gain reduces the bandwidth of the \noverall feedback loop.

When the DISABLE  node is pulled below 2  V \nfrom the positive supply, the supply current decreases from \ntypically 6.5 mA to under 400 µA, and the AD8063 output \nenter s a high impedance state.

Figure 33 shows the input/output isol ation response with \nthe AD8063 shut off.  \nBOARD LAYOUT CONSIDE RATIONS  \nMaintaining the high speed performance of the AD8061/ AD8062/  \nAD8063 family requires the use of high speed board layout \ntechniques and low parasitic components.  \nThe PCB should have a groun d plane covering unused portions \nof the component side of the board to provide a low impedance \npath. Remove the ground plane near the package to reduce \nparasitic capacitance.  \nProper bypassing is critical. Use a ceramic 0.1 µ F chip capacitor \nto bypass both supplies. Locate the chip capacitor within 3  mm \nof each power pin. Additionally, connect in parallel a 4.7  µF to \n10 µF tantalum electrolytic capacitor to provide charge for fast, \nlarge signal changes at the output. \nMinimizing parasitic capacitance at the a mplifier’s inverting \ninput pin is very important. Locate the feedback resistor close to \nthe inverting input pin. The value of the feedback resistor may \ncome into play —for instance, 1 kΩ interacting with 1 pF of \nparasitic capacitance creates a pole at 159 MHz. Use stripline design techniques for signal traces longer than 25 mm. Design them with either 50 Ω or 75 Ω characteristic impedance and proper termination at each end.  \n \nData Sheet  AD8061/AD8062/AD8063 \n \nRev.

In the case of analog -to-digital  conversion, \nthe sync pulses consume some of the dynamic range, so \nremoving them increases the converter’s available dy namic \nrange for the video information.  \nFigure 53 shows a basic circuit for creating a sync stripper using \nthe AD8061 powered by a single supply. When the negative supply is at ground potential, the lowest potential to which the \noutput can go is ground. This feature is exploited to create a \nwaveform whose lowest amplitude is the black level of the video \nand does not include the sync level.  \n75Ω VIDEO OUT\n75Ω\nRG\n1kΩ75Ω\nRF\n1kΩ10µF3V\nAD80610.1µF\n3\n2\n467\nVIDEO IN\nPIN NUMBERS ARE\nFOR 8-LEAD PACKAGE\n01065-053 \nFigure 53. Single 3 V Sync Stripper Using AD8061  \nIn this case, the input video signal has its black level at ground,  \nso it comes out at ground at the input. Because  the sync level is \nbelow the black level, it does  not show up at the output. However, \nall of the active video portion of the waveform is  amplified by a \ngain o f 2 and then normalized to unity gain by the back -\nterminated transmission line. Figure 54 is an oscilloscope plot \nof the input and output waveforms.  \n01065-054500mVINPUT\nOUTPUT1\n2\n10µs\n \nFigure 54. Input and Output Waveforms for a Single -Sup ply  \nVideo Sync Stripper Using an AD8061  \nSome video signals with sync are derived from single -supply \ndevices, such as video DACs. These signals can contain sync, but the whole waveform is positive, and the black level is not at ground but at a  positive vol tage.  \n The circuit can be modified to provide the sync stripping function for such a waveform. Instead of connecting R\nG to \nground, connect it to a dc voltage that is two times the black level of the input signal. The gain from the noninverting input  \nto th e output is 2 , which means the black level is  amplified by 2  \nto the output. However, the gain through R\nG is −1 to the output. \nIt takes a dc level of twice the input black level to shift the black \nlevel to ground at the output. When this occurs, the sync is \nstripped, and the active video is  passed as in the ground -\nreferenced case.  \n75Ω10µF 0.1µF3V\n32\n46775Ω\nMONI TOR\n#175Ω\n75Ω\n75Ω1kΩ\n1kΩ\n1kΩ\n1kΩ3V1kΩ\n32\n5\n678\n1\n4MONI TOR\n#2GREEN\nDAC\nRED\nGREEN\nBLUERED\nDAC\nBLUE\nDAC75Ω\n75Ω75Ω\n75Ω\nAD8061\n75Ω\n10µF 0.1µF\n1kΩ\nAD8062\n75Ω\nAD8062\n75Ω\n01065-055 \nFigure 55. RGB Cable Driver Using AD8061 and AD8062  \nRGB AMPLIFIER  \nMost RGB graphics signals are created by video DAC outputs \nthat drive a current through a resistor to ground. At the video \nblack level, the current goes to zero, and the voltage of the video is also zero. Before the availability of high speed rail -to-rail op \namps, it was essential that an amplifier have a negative supply to amplify such a signal. Such an amplifier is necessary if one \nwants to drive a second monitor from the same DAC outputs.  \nHowev er, high speed, rail -to-rail output amplifiers like the \nAD8061 and AD8062 accept ground -level input signals and \noutput ground -level signals. They are used as RGB signal \namplifiers. A combination of the AD8061 (single) and the AD8062 (dual) amplifies the th ree video channels of an RGB \nsystem. Figure 55 shows a circuit that performs this function.  \nAD8061/AD8062/AD8063 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

If two (or more) \nAD80 63 outputs are connected together, and only one is enabled, \nthen only the signal of the enabled amplifier will appear at the \noutput. This configuration is used to select from various input signal sources. Additionally, the same input signal is applied to different gain stages, or differently tuned filters, to make a gain-\nstep amplifier or a selectable frequency amplifier.  \nFigure 56 shows a schematic of two AD8063  device s used to \ncreate a mux that selects between two inputs.
