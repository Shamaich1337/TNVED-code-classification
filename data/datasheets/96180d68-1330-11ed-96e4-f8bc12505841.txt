GENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe W25Q64FV  (64M-bit) Serial Flash memory  provide s a storage solution for systems wi th limited \nspace, pins and power. The 25 Q series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash \ndevices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM,  executing code directly from D ual/Quad SPI  (XIP) \nand storing voice, text and data. The device operate s on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current \nconsumption as low as 4mA active and 1µA for power -down. All devices are of fered in space -saving \npackages.  \nThe W25Q64FV  array is organized into 32,768 programmable pages of 256 -bytes each. Up to 256 bytes \ncan be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 ( 4KB sector erase), groups of 128 \n(32KB block erase), groups of 256 ( 64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The W25Q64FV  has \n2,048 erasable sectors and 128 erasabl e blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater \nflexibility in applications that require data and parameter storage. (See figure 2.)  \nThe W25Q64FV  support  the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O  SPI as well as 2 -\nclocks instruction cycle Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) : Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O 0 (DI), \nI/O1 (DO), I/O2 (/WP), and I/O3 (/HOLD) . SPI clock frequencies of up to 104MHz are supported allowing \nequivalent clock rates of 208MHz ( 104MHz x 2) for Dua l I/O and 416MHz ( 104MHz x 4) for Quad I/O when \nusing the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O and QPI instructions.  These transfer rates can outperform standard \nAsynchronous  8 and 16 -bit Parallel Flash memories. The Continuous Read Mode allows for efficient \nmemory acc ess with as few as 8 -clocks of instruction -overhead to read a 24 -bit address, allowing true XIP \n(execute  in place) operation.   \nA Hold pin, Write Protect pin and programmable write protect ion, with top or bottom array control,   \nprovide further control flexi bility. Additionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and \ndevice identification , a 64-bit Unique Serial Number  and three  256-bytes Security Registers . \n2.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \n4.1 Chip Select ( /CS) \nThe SPI Chip Select ( /CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS is high , the dev ice is \ndeselected and the Serial Data Output  (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, I O3) pins are  at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devices power consumption will be at standby levels unless an internal erase, program or \nwrite status register cycle is in progress. W hen /CS is brought low , the device will be selected, power \nconsumption will increase to active levels and instructions can be written to and data read from the device. \nAfter power -up, /CS must transition from high to low before a new instruction will be ac cepted. The /CS \ninput must track the VCC supply level at power -up and power -down (see “Write Protection” and figure 43). \nIf needed a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to accomplish this.  \n4.2 Serial Data Input, Output  and IOs  (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)   \nThe W25Q64FV  support s standard SPI, Dual SPI, Quad SPI and QPI operation. Standard SPI \ninstructions use the unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to  the \ndevice  on the rising edge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin . Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO \n(output) to read data or status from the device  on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual/Quad SPI and QPI instruction s use the bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses \nor data to the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on the falling edge \nof CLK. Quad SPI and QPI instructions require the non-volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 \nto be set.  When QE=1 , the /WP pin becomes IO2 and /HOLD  pin becomes  IO3. \n4.3 Write Protect ( /WP) \nThe Write Protect ( /WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register s from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the Status Register’s Block Protect ( CMP, SEC, TB,  BP2, BP1 and BP0 ) bits and Status \nRegister Protect (SRP) bits,  a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory array can be \nhardware protected. The /WP pin is active low.  However, w hen the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for \nQuad I/ O, the /WP pin function is not available since this pin is used for  IO2. See figure 1a, 1b and 1 c for \nthe pin configuration of Quad I/O operation . \n4.4 HOLD  (/HOLD ) \nThe /HOLD  pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. When /HOLD  is brought low, \nwhile /CS is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals o n the DI  and CLK pins will be ignored \n(don’t care). When /HOLD  is brought high, device operation can resume. The  /HOLD  function can be \nuseful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals.  The /HOLD pin is active low. When the \nQE bit of Status Reg ister-2 is set for Quad I/O, the /HOLD pin function is not available since this pin is \nused for IO3. See figure 1a, 1b  and 1c  for the pin configuration of Quad I/O operation.  \n4.5 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for s erial input an d output operations.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ONS \n6.1 SPI/QPI OPERATIONS  \n \nFigure 3. W 25Q64FV  Serial Flash Memory Operation Diagram  \n \n6.1.1  Standard SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q64FV  is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock \n(CLK), Chip Select ( /CS), Serial Data Input  (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard SPI instructions \nuse the DI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of \nCLK. The  DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling edge  of CLK.  \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and \nMode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is \nnot being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0 , the CLK signal is normall y low  on the falling and \nrising edges of /CS.  For Mode 3 , the CLK signal is normally high  on the falling and rising edges of /CS .  \n6.1.2  Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q64FV  support s Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as  “Fast Read Dual Output  \n(3Bh)”  and “Fast Read Dual I/O  (BBh) ”. These instructions  allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice  at two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices.  The Dual SPI Read instruction s are \nideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -shadowing) or for execut ing non-speed -\ncritical  code directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructions , the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional I/ O pins:  IO0 and IO1.  \nPower On\nStandard SPI\nDual SPI\nQuad SPI\noperationsQPI\noperationsDevice\nInitialization\nEnable QPI (38h)\nDisable QPI ( FFh)Reset (66h + 99h) Reset (66h + 99h)Power On\nStandard SPI\nDual SPI\nQuad SPI\noperationsQPI\noperationsDevice\nInitialization\nEnable QPI (38h)\nDisable QPI ( FFh)Reset (66h + 99h) Reset (66h + 99h)\nW25Q64FV  \n \n- 14 -  6.1.3  Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q64FV  supports Quad  SPI operation wh en using instructions such as  “Fast Read Quad  Output  \n(6Bh) ”, “Fast Read  Quad  I/O (EBh) ”, “Word Read Quad I/O  (E7h) ” and “Octal Word Read Quad I/O  \n(E3h) ”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the device four to six times the rate of \nordinary Serial Flash. The Quad Read instructions offer a significant improvement in continuous  and \nrandom access transfer rates allowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or execut ion directly from the SPI bus \n(XIP) . When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins become bidirectional IO0 and IO1 , and the \n/WP and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 respectively. Quad SPI instructions require the non -volatile \nQuad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set . \n6.1.4  QPI Instructions  \nThe W 25Q64FV  supports Quad Peripheral In terface (QPI) operations  only when the device is switched \nfrom Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the “Enable QPI (38h)” instruction.  The typical \nSPI protocol requires that the byte-long instruction code being shifted into the device only via DI  pin in \neight serial clocks. The QPI mode utilizes all four IO pins to input the instruction code, thus only two serial \nclocks are required. This can significantly reduce the SPI instruction overhead and improve system \nperformance in an XIP environment. Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode and QPI mode are exclusive. Only \none mode can be active at any given time. “Enable QPI (38h)” and “Disable QPI (FFh)” instructions are \nused to switch between these two modes. Upon power -up or after a software reset using “Reset (9 9h)” \ninstruction , the default state of the device is  Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode.  To enable QPI mode, the \nnon-volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 is required to be set.  When using QPI instructions, \nthe DI and DO pins become bidirectional IO0  and IO1, and the /WP and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 \nrespectively.  See Figure 3 for the device operation modes.  \n6.1.5  Hold Function  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, t he /HOLD  signal allows the W25Q64FV  operation to be \npaused while it is actively sele cted (when /CS is low). The  /HOLD  function may be useful in cases where \nthe SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For example, consider if the page buffer \nwas only partially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the SPI bus.  In this case the  /HOLD  \nfunction can save the state of the instruction and the data in the buffer so programming can resume where \nit left off once the bus is available again.  The /HOLD function is only available for standard SPI and Dual \nSPI operation, not  during Quad SPI  or QPI . \nTo initiate a  /HOLD  condition, the device must be selected with /CS low. A  /HOLD  condition will activate on \nthe falling edge of the /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the  \n/HOLD  condition wi ll activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The  /HOLD  condition will terminate on the \nrising edge of the  /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the  /HOLD  \ncondition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK.  During a  /HOLD  condition, the Serial Data \nOutput (DO) is high impedance, a nd Serial Data Input (DI ) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip \nSelect ( /CS) signal should be kept active (low) for the full duration of the  /HOLD  operation to avoid \nresettin g the internal logic state of the device.  \nW25Q64FV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  July 18, 2017  \n- 15 -                                    Revision S  6.2 WRITE PROTECTION  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and other \nadverse system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this concern , the W25Q64FV  \nprovides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n6.2.1  Write Protect Features  \n \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf0b7 Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions  and a utomatic write disable after e rase or program  \n\uf0b7 Software and Hardware (/WP pin) write protection using Status Register  \n\uf0b7 Write Protection using Power -down instruction   \n\uf0b7 Lock Down write protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf0b7 One Time Program (OTP) write protection for array and  Security Register s using Status Register* \n \n* Note : This feature  is available upon special order. Please contact Winbond for details.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down , the W25Q64FV  will maintain a reset condition while VCC is below the \nthreshold value of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 43). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the VCC voltage \nexceeds V WI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled f or a time delay of t PUW. This \nincludes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and the Write Status \nRegister instructions. Note that the chip select pin ( /CS) must track the VCC supply level at power -up until \nthe VCC -min level  and t VSL time delay is reached , and it must also track the VCC supply level at power -\ndown to prevent adverse command sequence . If needed a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to \naccomplish this.  \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a writ e-disabled state with the Status Register Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instruction must be issued before a Page Program, Sector \nErase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will be accepted. After completing a \nprogram, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is automatically cleared to a write -\ndisabled state of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and setting the \nStatus Register Protec t (SRP 0, SRP1 ) and Block Protect ( CMP, SEC,  TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 ) bits. These \nsettings  allow a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire  memory  array  to be configured as read only. \nUsed in conjunction with the Write Protect ( /WP) pin, changes to the S tatus Register can be enabled or \ndisabled under hardware control. See Status Register section for further information.  Additionally, the \nPower -down instruction offers an extra level of write protection as all instructions are ignored except for \nthe Release  Power -down instruction.  \nW25Q64FV  \n \n- 16 -  7. STATUS REGISTERS  AND INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe Read Status Register -1 and Status Register -2 instruction s can be used to provide status on the \navailability of the Flash memory array, if the device is write enabled or disabled, the state of write \nprotection , Quad SPI s etting, Security Register lock status and Erase/Program Suspend status . The Write \nStatus Register instruction can be used to configure the device  write protection features , Quad SPI sett ing \nand Security Register OTP lock . Write access to the Status Register is controlled by the state of the  non-\nvolatile  Status Register Protect bits (SRP 0, SRP1 ), the Write Enable instruction, and during Standard/Dual \nSPI operations, the /WP pin .  \n7.1 STATUS REGISTER S \n7.1.1  BUSY  \nBUSY is a read only bit in t he status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is executing a \nPage Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register or \nErase/Program Security Register instruction. During this time the device will i gnore further instructions \nexcept for the Read Status Register and Erase /Program  Suspend instruction (see t W, tPP, tSE, tBE, and \ntCE in AC Characteristics). When the program, erase or write status /security  register instruction has \ncompleted, the BUSY bit w ill be cleared to a 0 state indicating the device is ready for further instructions.   \n7.1.2  Write Enable Latch (WEL)  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the statu s register (S1) that is set to  1 after executing a \nWrite Enable Instruction. Th e WEL stat us bit is cleared to  0 when the device is write disabled. A write \ndisable state occurs upon power -up or after any of the following instructions: Write Disable, Page \nProgram, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase,  Write Status Register , Erase \nSecurity Register and Program Security Register . \n7.1.3  Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0)  \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4, S3, and \nS2) that provide Write Protection control and status. Block  Protect bits can be set using the Write Status \nRegister Instruction (see t W in AC characteristics). All, none or a portion of the memory array can be \nprotected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory Protection table). The \nfactory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protected.   \n7.1.4  Top/Bottom Block Protect  (TB) \nThe non-volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect from the \nTop (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. \nThe f actory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write Status Register Instruction \ndepending on the state of the SRP0, SRP1 and WEL bits.  \n7.1.5  Sector /Block  Protect  (SEC)   \nThe non-volatile Sector /Block  Protect bit  (SEC)  controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \neither 4KB Sectors  (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks  (SEC=0) in  the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array \nas shown in the Status Register Memory Protection tabl e. The  default setting is SEC=0.  \n7.1.6  Complement Protect (CMP)  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S14). It is used in \nconjunction with SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide more flexibility for the arr ay protection. Once \nW25Q64FV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  July 18, 2017  \n- 17 -                                    Revision S  CMP is set to 1, previous array protection set by SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 will be reversed. For \ninstance, when CMP=0, a top 4KB sector can be protected while the rest of the array is not; when CMP=1, \nthe top 4KB sector will become unp rotected while the rest of the array become read -only. Please refer to \nthe Status Register Memory Protection table for details. The  default setting is CMP =0. \n7.1.7  Status Register Protect  (SRP 1, SRP0) \nThe Status Register Protect  bits (SRP 1 and SRP0 ) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register  \n(S8 and S7). The SRP bits control the method of write protection: software protection, hardware \nprotection, power supply lock-down or one time programmable (OTP) protection.  \nSRP1  SRP0  /WP Status  \nRegister  Descrip tion \n0 0 X Software  \nProtection  /WP pin has no control. The Status register can be written to \nafter a Write Enable instruction , WEL=1 . [Factory Default]  \n0 1 0 Hardware  \nProtect ed When /WP pin is low the Status Register locked and can not \nbe written to . \n0 1 1 Hardware  \nUnprotected  When /WP pin is high the Status register is unlocked and can \nbe written to after a Write Enable instruction , WEL=1.  \n1 0 X Power  Supply  \nLock -Down  Status Register is protected and can not be written to again \nuntil the next power -down , power -up cycle .(1)  \n1 1 X One Time  \nProgram(2) Status Register is permanently  protected and can not be \nwritten  to. \nNote:  \n1.  When SRP1, SRP0 = (1, 0), a power -down, power -up cycle will change SRP1, SRP0 to (0, 0) state. 2.  \nThis feature is available  upon special order. Please contact Winbond for details.  \n7.1.8  Erase/Program Suspend Status (SUS)  \nThe Suspend Status bit is a read only bit in the status register (S15) that is set to 1 after executing a \nErase/Program Suspend (75h) instruction. The SUS status bi t is cleared to 0 by Erase/Program Resume \n(7Ah) instr uction as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n7.1.9  Security Register Lock Bits  (LB3, LB2, LB1 ) \nThe Security Regist er Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1 ) are non -volatile One Time Program (OTP) bits in Sta tus \nRegister  (S13, S12, S11 ) that provide the write protect control and status to the Security Registers . The \ndefault state of LB3 -0 is 0, Security Registers are unlocked. LB3 -1 can be set to 1 individually using the \nWrite Status Register instruction. LB3-1 are One Ti me Programmable (OTP), once it’s set to 1, the \ncorresponding 256 -Byte Security Register will become read -only permanently.  \n7.1.10  Quad Enable  (QE) \nThe Quad Enable  (QE) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S 9) that allow s Quad SPI \nand QPI operation . When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default  for part number with ordering \noptions “IG”  and “IF” ), the /WP pin  and /H OLD are enabled . When the QE bit is set to a 1 (factory default \nW25Q64FV  \n \n- 18 -  for Quad Enabled part numbers with ordering option “IQ”) , the Quad IO2 and I O3 pins are enabled , and \n/WP and /HOLD functions are disabled . \nQE bit is required to be set to a 1 before issuing an “Enable QPI (38h)” to switch the device from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI to QPI, otherwise the command will be ignored.  When t he device is in QPI mode, \nQE bit will remain to be 1.

Instructions are initiated with the \nfalling edge of Chip Select (/CS) . The first byte of data clo cked into the DI  input provides the i nstruction \ncode. Data on the DI  input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with mo st significant bit (MSB) first.  \nThe QPI instruction set of the W 25Q64FV  consists of twenty four basic instructions that are fully controll ed \nthrough the SPI bus (see Instruction Set table 4). Instructions are initiated with the falling edge of Chip \nSelect (/CS). The first byte of data clocked through IO[3:0] pins provides the instruction code. Data on all \nfour IO pins are  sampled on the risi ng edge of clock with most significant bit (MSB) first.  All QPI \ninstructions, addresses, data and dummy bytes are using all four IO pins to transfer every byte of data with \nevery two serial clocks (CLK).  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to se veral bytes and may be followed by address bytes, data \nbytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are completed with the \nrising edge of edge  /CS. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction are included in figur es 5 \nthrough 42. All read instructions can be completed after any clocked bit. However, all instructions that \nWrite, Program or Erase must complete on a byte boundary ( /CS driven high after a full 8 -bits have been \nclocked) otherwise the instruction will be  ignor ed. This feature further protects the device from inadvertent \nwrites. Additionally, while the memory is being programmed or erased, or when the Status Register is \nbeing written, all instructions except for Read Status Register will be ignored until t he program or erase \ncycle has completed.  \n7.2.1  Manufacturer and Device Identification  \nMANUFACTURER ID  (MF7 - MF0)  \nWinbond Serial Flash  EFh \n \nDevice ID  (ID7 - ID0) (ID15  - ID0) \nInstruction   ABh, 90h , 92h, 94h  9Fh \nW25Q64FV (SPI)  16h 4017h \nW25Q64FV (QPI)  16h 6017h \n \nW25Q64FV  \n \n- 22 -  7.2.2  Instruction Set  Table 1  (Standard SPI  Instructions)(1) \nINSTRUCTION NAME  BYTE 1  BYTE 2  BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5  BYTE 6  \nCLOCK NUMBER  (0 – 7) (8 – 15) (16 – 23) (24 – 31) (32 – 39) (40 – 47) \nWrite Enable  06h  \nVolatile SR Write Enable  50h  \nWrite D isable  04h  \nRead Status Register -1 05h (S7-S0)(2)  \nRead Status Register -2 35h (S15-S8)(2)  \nWrite Status Register  01h (S7-S0) (S15-S8)  \nPage Program  02h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 D7-D0(3) \nSector  Erase (4KB)  20h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (32 KB) 52h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock  Erase ( 64KB)  D8h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nChip Erase  C7h/60h  \nErase / Program Suspend  75h  \nErase / Program Resume  7Ah  \nPower -down  B9h  \nRead Data  03h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 (D7-D0)  \nFast Read  0Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  (D7-D0) \nRelease Power down / ID(4) ABh dummy  dummy  dummy  (ID7-ID0)(2)  \nManufacturer/Device ID(4) 90h dummy  dummy  00h (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0) \nJEDEC ID(4) 9Fh (MF7 -MF0) \nManufacturer  (ID15 -ID8)  \nMemory Type  (ID7-ID0)  \nCapacity   \nRead Unique ID  4Bh dummy  dummy  dummy  dummy  (UID63 -UID0) \nRead SFDP Register  5Ah 00h 00h A7–A0 dummy   (D7-0) \nErase  \nSecurity Registers(5) 44h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nProgram  \nSecurity Registers(5) 42h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0 D7-D0(3) \nRead  \nSecurity Registers(5) 48h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy   (D7-D0) \nEnable QPI  38h  \nEnable Reset  66h  \nReset  99h  \n \n \nW25Q64FV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  July 18, 2017  \n- 23 -                                    Revision S  7.2.3  Instruction Set Table 2 ( Dual SPI  Instructions)  \nINSTRUCTION NAME  BYTE 1  BYTE 2  BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5  BYTE 6  \nCLOCK NUMBER  (0 – 7) (8 – 15) (16 – 23) (24 – 31) (32 – 39) (40 – 47) \nFast Read Dual Output  3Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  (D7-D0, …)(7) \nFast Read Dual I/O  BBh A23-A8(6) A7-A0, M7-M0 (6) (D7-D0, …)(7)  \nManufacturer/Device ID by \nDual I/O(4) 92h A23-A8(6) A7-A0, M7-M0 (6) (MF7-MF0, \nID7-ID0)  \n \n7.2.4  Instruction Set Table 3 ( Quad SPI  Instructions)  \nINSTRUCTION NAME  BYTE 1  BYTE 2  BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5  BYTE 6  \nCLOCK NUMBER  (0 – 7) (8 – 15) (16 – 23) (24 – 31) (32 – 39) (40 – 47) \nQuad Page Program  32h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0, …(9) D7-D0, …(3) \nFast Read Quad Output  6Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy  (D7-D0, …)(9) \nFast Read Quad I/O  EBh A23-A0, \nM7-M0(8) (xxxx, D7-D0)(10) (D7-D0, …)(9)  \nWord Read Quad I/O(12) E7h A23-A0, \nM7-M0(8) (xx, D7-D0)(11) (D7-D0, …)(9)  \nOctal Word Read  \nQuad I/O(13) E3h A23-A0, \nM7-M0(8) (D7-D0, …)(9)  \nSet Burst with Wrap  77h xxxxxx,  \nW6-W4(8)  \nManufacture/Device ID by \nQuad I/O(4) 94h A23-A0, \nM7-M0(8) xxxx, ( MF7-MF0, \nID7-ID0) (MF7-MF0, \nID7-ID0, …)  \nW25Q64FV  \n \n- 24 -  7.2.5  Instruction Set Table 4 (QPI Instructions)(14) \nINSTRUCTION NAME  BYTE 1  BYTE 2  BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5  BYTE 6  \nCLOCK NUMBER  (0 , 1) (2 , 3) (4 , 5) (6 , 7) (8 , 9) (10 , 11) \nWrite Enable  06h  \nVolatile SR Write Enable  50h  \nWrite Disable  04h  \nRead Status Register -1 05h (S7-S0)(2)  \nRead Status Register -2 35h (S15-S8)(2)  \nWrite Status Register  01h (S7-S0) (S15 -S8)  \nPage P rogram  02h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 D7-D0(9) D7-D0(3) \nSector Erase (4KB)  20h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (32KB)  52h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nBlock Erase (64KB)  D8h A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0  \nChip Erase  C7h/60h  \nErase / Program Suspend  75h  \nErase / Program  Resume  7Ah  \nPower -down  B9h  \nSet Read Parameters  C0h P7-P0  \nFast Read  0Bh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy(15) (D7-D0) \nBurst Read with Wrap(16) 0Ch A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 dummy(15) (D7-D0) \nFast Read Quad I/O  EBh A23-A16 A15-A8 A7-A0 M7-M0(15) (D7-D0) \nReleas e Powerdown / ID(4) ABh dummy  dummy  dummy  (ID7-ID0)(2)  \nManufacturer/Device ID(4) 90h dummy  dummy  00h (MF7 -MF0)  (ID7-ID0) \nJEDEC ID(4) 9Fh (MF7 -MF0) \nManufacturer  (ID15 -ID8)  \nMemory Type  (ID7-ID0)  \nCapacity   \nDisable QPI  FFh  \nEnable Reset  66h  \nReset  99h  \n \n \nW25Q64FV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  July 18, 2017  \n- 25 -                                    Revision S  Notes:  \n \n1.

The instruction is \nentered by driving /CS low and shifting the instruction code “05h”  for Statu s Register -1 or “35h” for \nStatus Register -2 into the DI  pin on the rising edge of CLK. The status register bits are then shifted out on \nthe DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure 8. The Status \nRegister bi ts are shown in Figure 4a and 4 b and include the BUSY, WEL, BP 2-BP0, TB, SEC,  SRP0, \nSRP1 , QE, LB3 -0, CMP and SUS  bits (see Status Register section earlier in this datasheet ).  \nThe Read Status Register instruction may be used at any time, even while a Progr am, Erase or Write \nStatus Register cycle is in progress. This allows the BUSY status bit to be checked to determine when the \ncycle is complete and if the device can accept another instruction.

Read Status Register Instruction ( QPI Mode ) \n \n \n7.2.10  Write Status Register (01h)  \nThe Write Status Register instruction allows the Statu s Register to be written. Only non -volatile Status \nRegister bits SRP0, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, BP0 (bits 7 thru 2 of Status Register -1) and CMP, LB3, L B2, \nLB1, QE, SRP1 (bits 14 thru 8 of Status Register -2) can be written to. All other Status Register bit \nlocat ions are read -only and will not be affected by the Write Status Register instruction. LB3 -0 are non -\nvolatile OTP bits, once it is set to 1, it can not be cleared to 0. The Status Register bits are shown in \nFigure  4a and 4 b, and described in 7.1. \nTo write n on-volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously have \nbeen executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL \nmust equal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is ent ered by driving /CS low, sending the instruction \ncode “01h”, and then writing the status register data byte as illustrated in figure 9. \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must \nhave been exe cuted prior to the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL remains 0). \nHowever, SRP1 and LB3, LB2, LB1 can not be changed from “1” to “0” because of the OTP protection for \nthese bits. Upon power off  or the execution of a “Reset (99h)” in struction , the volatile Status Register bit \nvalues will be lost, and the non -volatile Status Register bit values will be restored . \nTo complete the Write Status Register instruction, the /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth or \nsixteenth bit of data that is clocked in. If this is not done the Write Status Register instruction will not be \nexecuted. If /CS is driven high after the eighth clock (compatible with the 25X series) the CMP, QE and \nSRP1 bits will be cleared to 0.  \nDuring non -volatile Status Reg ister write operation (06h combined with 01h), after /CS is driven high, the \nself-timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See AC Characteristics). \nWhile the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Read Status Regi ster instruction may still be \naccessed to check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Write Status Register cycle \nand a 0 when the cycle is finished and ready to accept other instructions again. After the Write Status \nRegister cycle ha s finished, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be cleared to 0.  \nW25Q64FV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  July 18, 2017  \n- 29 -                                    Revision S  During volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h), after /CS is driven high, the \nStatus Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within  the time period of t SHSL2  (See AC \nCharacteristics). BUSY bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit refresh period.  \nThe Write Status Register instruction can be used in both SPI mode and QPI mode. However, the QE bit \ncannot be written to when the de vice is in the QPI mode, because QE=1 is required for the device to enter \nand operate in the QPI mode.  \nPlease refer to 7.1 for detailed Status Register Bit descriptions.

The \ninstruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and then shif ting the instruction code “03h”  followed by a \n24-bit address (A23 -A0) into the DI  pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the \nCLK pin. After the address is received, t he data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out \non the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The address is automatically \nincremented to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out all owing for a continuous \nstream of data. This means that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction as long as \nthe clock continues. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in figure 10. If a Read Data instruction is issued while an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on the current cycle. The Read Data instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of f R \n(see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \nThe Read Data (03h) instruction is only supported in Standard SPI mode. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (03h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 724-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1\n**\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 10.

This is accomplished by adding eight \n“dummy” clocks after the 24 -bit address as shown in figure 11.

This allows data to be transferred from the W25Q64FV  at \ntwice the rat e of standard SPI devices. The Fast Read Dual Output instruction is ideal for quickly \ndownloading code from Flash to RAM upon power -up or for applications that cache code -segments to \nRAM for execution.  \nSimilar to the Fast Read instruction, the Fast Read D ual Output instruction can operate at the highest \npossible frequency of FR (see AC Electrical Characteristics). This is accomplished by adding eight \n“dummy” clocks after the 24 -bit address as shown in Figure 12. The dummy clocks allow the device\'s \ninternal  circuits additional time for setting up the initial address. The input data during the dummy clocks is \n“don’t care”.

A Qua d enable of Status Register -2 must be \nexecuted before the device will accept the Fast Read  Quad Output Instruction (Status Register bit  QE \nmust equal  1).

It is similar to the Fast Read D ual Output (3Bh) instruction but with the capability to input \nthe Address bits (A23 -0) two bits per clock. This reduced instruction overhead may allow for code \nexecution (XIP) directly from the D ual SPI in some applications.  \nFast Read Dual I/O with “Conti nuous Read Mode”  \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O instruction can further reduce instruction overhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” b its (M7 -0) after the input Address bits (A23 -0), as shown in Figure 1 4a. The \nupper nibble of the (M7 -4) controls the len gth of the next Fast Read Dual I/O instruction through the \ninclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the (M3 -0) are don’t care \n(“x”). However, the IO pins should be high -impedance prior to the falling edge of the f irst data out clock.  \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next Fast Read Dual I/O  instruction (after /CS is \nraised and then lowered) does not require the BBh instruction code,  as shown in Figure 14b. This reduces \nthe instruction seque nce by eight clocks and allows the Read address to be immediately entered after /CS \nis asserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 do not equal to (1,0), the next instruction (after \n/CS is raised and then lowered) requires the first byte instruct ion code, thus returning to normal operation. \nIt is recommended to input FFFFh on IO0 for the next instruction (16 clocks), to ensure M4 = 1 and return \nthe device to normal operation.  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (BBh)8 9 10 12 13 14\n24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n6 4 2 0\n**\n23/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)032 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\n7 5 3 1\n*6 4 2 0\n7 5 3 16 4 2 0\n7 5 3 16 4 2 0\n7 5 3 1\n* *IOs switch from\nInput to Output\n6\n722 20 18 16\n23 21 19 1714 12 10 8\n15 13 11 96 4 2 0\n7 5 3 16 4 2 0\n7 5 3 111 15 16 17 18 20 21 22 19 23\n1A23-16 A15-8 A7-0 M7-0\nByte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4= MSB**\n \n \nFigure 1 4a.

The Quad I/O dramatically reduces instruction \noverhead allowing faster random acc ess for code execution (XIP) directly from the Quad SPI. The  Quad \nEnable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 must be set to enable the Fast Read Quad I/O  Instruction .  \nFast Read Quad I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O instruction can further reduce instruction overhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7 -0) after the input Address bits (A23 -0), as shown in Figure 1 5a. The \nupper nibble of the (M7 -4) controls the length of the next Fast Read Quad I/O instruction through the \ninclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the (M3 -0) are don’t care \n(“x”). However, the IO pins should be high -impedance prior to the falling edge of the first data out clock.  \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next Fast Read Quad I/O  instruction (after /CS \nis raised and then lowered) does not require the EBh instruction code,  as shown in Figure 15b. This \nreduces the instruction sequence by eight clocks and allows the Read address to be immediatel y entered \nafter /CS is asserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 do not equal to (1,0), the next \ninstruction (after /CS is raised and then lowered) requires the first byte instruction code, thus returning to \nnormal operation. It is recommended to input FFh on IO0 for the next instruction (8 clocks), to ensure M4 \n= 1 and return the device to normal operation.  \nFigure 1 5a.

Fast Read Quad I/O Instruction (Previous instruction set M5 -4 = 10 , SPI  Mode ) \n \nFast Read Quad I/O with “8/16/32/64 -Byte Wrap Around”  in Standard SPI mode  \n \nThe Fast Read Q uad I/O instruction can also be used to access a specific portion within a page by issuing \na “Set Burst with Wrap”  (77h)  command prior to EBh. The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command can \neither enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the following EBh commands. When “Wrap \nAround” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either a 8, 16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a \n256-byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified in the instruction, once it reaches the \nending boundary  of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output will wrap around to the beginning boundary \nautomatically until /CS is pulled high to terminate the command.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical  address and then \nfill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple read \ncommands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to \nenable or disable the “Wrap Around ” operation while W6-5 are used to specify the length of the wrap \naround section within a page. See 7.2.19 for detail descriptions.  \nW25Q64FV  \n \nPublication Release Date:  July 18, 2017  \n- 39 -                                    Revision S   \nFast Read Quad I/O (EBh) in QPI Mode  \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O instruction is also supported in QPI mode , as shown in Figure 15c. When QPI \nmode is enabled, the number of dummy clocks is configured by the “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” \ninstruction to accommodate a wide range applications with different needs for either maximum Fast Read \nfrequency or minimum data access latency. Depe nding on the Read Parameter Bits P[5:4] setting, the \nnumber of dummy clocks can be configured as either 2, 4, 6 or 8. The default number of dummy clocks \nupon power up or after a Reset instruction is 2 . In QPI mode, the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M7 -0 are \nalso considered as dummy clocks. In the default setting, the data output will follow the Continuous Read \nMode bits immediately.  \n“Continuous Read Mode” feature is also available in QPI mode for Fast Read Quad I/O instruction. Please \nrefer to the description  on previous page s. \n“Wrap Around” feature is not available in QPI mode for Fast Read Quad I/O instruction. To perform a read \noperation with fixed data length wrap around in QPI mode, a dedicated “Burst Read with Wrap” (0Ch) \ninstruction must be used. Please  refer to 7.2.39 for details.  \nFigure 1 5c.

The Quad I/O dramatically reduces instruction overhead allowing faster random access for co de \nexecution (XIP) directly from the Quad SPI. The  Quad Enable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 must be set to \nenable the Word  Read Quad I/O  Instruction .  \nWord Read Quad I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Word Read Quad I/O instruction can further reduce ins truction overhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7 -0) after the input Address bits (A23 -0), as shown in Figure 1 6a. The \nupper nibble of the (M7 -4) controls the length of the next Fast Read Quad I/O instruction through the \ninclusion or ex clusion of the first byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the (M3 -0) are don’t care \n(“x”).

This \nreduces the instruction sequence by eight clocks and allows the Read address to be immediately entered \nafter /CS is asserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 do not equal to (1,0), the next \ninstruction (after /CS is raised and then lowered) requires the first byte instruction code, thus returning to \nnormal operation. It is recommended to input F Fh on IO0 for the next instruction (8 clocks), to ensure M4 \n= 1 and return the device to normal operation.  \nFigure 1 6a.

Word Read Quad I/O Instruction (Previous instruction set M5 -4 = 10 , SPI Mode only ) \n \nWord Read Quad I/O with “8/16/32/64 -Byte Wrap Around”  in Standard SPI mode  \nThe Word Rea d Quad I/O instruction can also be used to access a specific portion within a page by \nissuing a “Set Burst with Wrap”  (77h)  command prior to E7h. The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command \ncan either enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the followi ng E7h commands. When “Wrap \nAround” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either a 8, 16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a \n256-byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified in the instruction, once it reaches the \nending bound ary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output will wrap around to the beginning boundary \nautomatically until /CS is pulled high to terminate the command.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical  address a nd then \nfill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple read \ncommands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to \nenable or disable the “Wrap Aro und” operation while W6-5 are used to specify the length of the wrap \naround section within a page. See 7.2.19 for detail  descriptions.  \nW25Q64FV  \n \n- 42 -  7.2.18  Octal Word  Read Quad I/O (E3h)  \nThe Octal Word  Read Quad I/O (E3h) instruction is similar to the Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh)  instruction \nexcept that the lower four Address bits (A0, A1 , A2, A3 ) must equal 0. As a result, the dummy clocks are \nnot required, which further reduces the instruction overhead allowing even faster random access for code \nexecution (XIP). The Quad Enable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 must be se t to enable the Octal Word  \nRead Quad I/O Instruction.  \n \nOctal Word  Read Quad I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Octal Word  Read Quad I/O instruction can further reduce instruction overhead through setting the \n“Conti nuous Read Mode” bits (M7 -0) after the input Address bits (A23 -0), as shown in Figure 1 7a. The \nupper nibble of the (M7 -4) controls the length of the next Octal Word  Read Quad I/O instruction through \nthe inclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the (M3 -0) are don’t \ncare (“x”). However, the IO pins should be high -impedance prior to the falling edge of the first data out \nclock.  \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next Fast Read Quad I/O  instructi on (after /CS \nis raised and then lowered) does not require the E3h instruction code,  as shown in Figure 17b. This \nreduces the instruction sequence by eight clocks and allows the Read address to be immediately entered \nafter /CS is asserted low. If the “Cont inuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 do not equal to (1,0), the next \ninstruction (after /CS is raised and then lowered) requires the first byte instruction code, thus returning to \nnormal operation. It is recommended to input FFh on IO0 for the next instruction (8 c locks), to ensure M4 \n= 1 and return the device to normal operation.  \n \nM7-0/CS\nCLK Mode 0Mode 3 0 1\nIO0\nIO1\nIO2\nIO32 3 4 5\n20 16 12 8\n21 17\n22 18\n23 1913 9\n14 10\n15 11A23-166 7 8 9\n4 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 3A15-8 A7-0\nByte 1 Byte 24 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 34 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 34 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 310 11 12 13 14\n4\n5\n6\n7IOs switch from\nInput to Output\nByte 315 16 17 18 19 20 21\nInstruction (E3h)\n4 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 3\nByte 4\n \nFigure 1 7a.

Certain applications can benefit from this feature and improve the overall system \ncode execution performance.  \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low \nand then shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap Bits”, W7 -0. The \ninstruction sequence is shown in Figure 1 8.

To exit the “Wrap Around” function and return to normal read operation, another Set Burst with \nWrap instruction should be issued to set W4 = 1. The default value of W4 upon power on  is 1. In the case \nof a system Reset while W4 = 0, it is recommended that the controller issues a Set Burst with Wrap \ninstruction to reset W4 = 1 prior to any norma l Read instructions since W 25Q64FV  does not have a \nhardware Reset Pin.  \nIn QPI mode, the “Bur st Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instruction should be used to perform the Read operation \nwith “Wrap Around” feature. The Wrap Length set by W5 -4 in Standard SPI mode is still valid in QPI mode \nand can also be re-configured by “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” instructi on.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device \nwill accept the Page Program Instruction (Status Register bit WEL = 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the  /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” followed by a  24-bit address (A23 -A0) and \nat least one data byte, into the DI  pin. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction \nwhile data is being sent to the device. The Page Program instruction sequence is shown in Figure 1 9. \nIf an entire 25 6 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant address bits) \nshould be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks exceed the remaining \npage length, the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In some cases, less than 256 bytes (a \npartial page) can be programmed without having any effect on other bytes within the same page. One \ncondition to perform a partial page program is that the number of clocks can not exceed the remaining \npage le ngth. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the \npage and overwrite previously sent data.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte \nhas been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for a time duration of tpp (See AC \nCharacteristics). While the Page Program cycle is in p rogress, the Read Status Register instruction may \nstill be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Page Program \ncycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept other instructions \nagain. After the Page Program cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register \nis cleared to 0. The Page Program instruction will not be executed if the addressed page is protected by \nthe Block Protect ( CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits .  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (02h)8 9 10 28 29 30 39\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1\n*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47\nData Byte 248 49 50 52 53 54 55\n2072\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 051 39\n031\n032 33 34 35 36 37 38\nData Byte 1\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n*\nMode 0Mode 3\nData Byte 3\n2073\n2074\n2075\n2076\n2077\n2078\n20790\nData Byte 256\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*= MSB*\n \nFigure 19a.

The Quad Page Program can \nimprove performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slow clock speeds <5MHz. \nSystems with faster clock s peed will not realize much benefit for the Quad Page Program instruction since \nthe inherent page program time is much greater than the time it take to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad Enable in Status Register -2 must be set (QE=1). A Wr ite Enable \ninstruction  must be executed before the device will accept the Quad Page Program instruction (Status \nRegister -1, WEL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code \n“32h” followed by a 24 -bit addres s (A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the IO pins. The  /CS pin must \nbe held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device. All other functions \nof Quad Page Program are identical to standard Page Program.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Sector Erase \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low \nand shifting the instruction code “20h” follow ed a 24 -bit sector address (A23 -A0) (see Figure 2). The \nSector Erase instructi on sequence is shown in Figure 21a & 21b . \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the \nSector Erase instruction  will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the self -timed Sector Erase \ninstruction will commence for a time duration of t SE (See AC Characteristics). While the Sector Erase \ncycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may still be acces sed for checking the status of \nthe BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Sector Erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is \nfinished and the device is ready to accept other instructions again. After the Sector Erase cycle has \nfinished the Write Enable  Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0.

A Write Enable in struction must be executed before the device will accept the Block Erase \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low \nand shifting the instruction code “52 h” followed a 24 -bit block address (A2 3-A0). The Block Erase \ninstructio n sequence is shown in Figure 22a & 22b . \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the \nBlock Erase instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high , the self -timed Block Erase instruction \nwill commence for a time duration of t BE1 (See AC Characteristics). While the Block Erase cycle is in \nprogress, the Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY \nbit.

A Write \nEnable instruction must be executed before the device will acce pt the Chip Erase Instruction (Status \nRegister bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “C7h”  or “60h”.

The Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequence is shown in Figure 25 a & 25b . \nThe Write Status Register instruct ion (01h) and Erase instructions (20h, 52h, D8h, C7h, 60h, 44h) are not \nallowed during Erase Suspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase operation. If \nwritten during the Chip Erase operation, the Erase Suspend instruction is ignor ed. The Write Status \nRegister instruction (01h) and Program instructions (02h, 32h, 42h) are not allowed during Program \nSuspend. Program Suspend is valid only during the Page Program or Quad Page Program operation.  \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction “75 h” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit in the \nStatus Register equals to 0 and the BUSY bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a Page \nProgram operation is on -going. If the SUS bit equals to 1 or the BUSY bit equals to 0, the Suspend  \ninstruction will be ignored by the device. A maximum of time of “t SUS” (See AC Characteristics) is required \nto suspend the erase or program operation. The BUSY bit in the Status Register will be cleared from 1 to \n0 within “t SUS” and the SUS bit in the Sta tus Register will be set from 0 to 1 immediately after \nErase/Program Suspend. For a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it is also required that the \nSuspend instruction “75h” is not issued earlier than a minimum of time of “t SUS” following the prec eding \nResume instruction “7Ah”.  \nUnexpected power off during the Erase/Program suspend state will reset the device and release the \nsuspend state. SUS bit in the Status Register will also reset to 0. The data within the page, sector or block \nthat was being s uspended may become corrupted. It is recommended for the user to implement system \ndesign techniques against the accidental power interruption and preserve data integrity during \nerase/program suspend state.  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (75h)\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3tSUS\nAccept instructions\n \nFigure 25a.

The lower power consumption makes the Power -down \ninstruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See ICC1 and ICC2 in AC Char acteristics). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “B9h” as  shown in \nFigure 27a & 27b .  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Power -down \ninstructi on will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the power -down state will entered within the time \nduration of t DP (See AC Characteristics). While in the power -down state only the Release from Power -\ndown / Device ID instruction, which restores the device  to normal operation, will be recognized. All other \ninstructions are ignored. This includes the Read Status Register instruction, which is always available \nduring normal operation. Ignoring all but one instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condit ion \nfor securing maximum write protection. The device always powers -up in the normal operation with the \nstandby current of ICC1.   \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (B9h)Mode 0Mode 3tDP\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 27a.

It can be used to \nrelease the device from the power -down state , or obtain the devices electronic i dentification (ID) number.  \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the /CS pin low, \nshifting the instruction code “ABh” and driving /CS high as shown in Figure 28a & 28b . Release from \npower -down will take the time duration of t RES1 (See AC Characteristics) before the device will resume \nnormal operation and other instructions are accepted. The /CS pin must remain high during the t RES1 time \nduration.  \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruction is initiated by \ndriving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy bytes. The Device ID \nbits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in figur e \n28. The Device ID values for the W 25Q64FV  is listed in Manufacturer and Device Identification table. The \nDevice ID can be read continuously. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the instruction is \nthe same as previously described, and shown in Figure 28c & 28d , except that after /CS is driven high it \nmust remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See AC Characteristics). After this time duration the device \nwill resume normal operation and other instructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power -down / \nDevice ID instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (when BUSY equals \n1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effects on the current cycle. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (ABh)Mode 0Mode 3tRES1\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 28a.

The SFDP parameters \nare sto red in one or more Parameter Identification (PID) tables. Currently only one PID table is specified, \nbut more may be added in the future.  The Read SFDP Register instruction is com patible with the SFDP \nstandard initially established in 2010  for PC and other  applications, as well as the JEDEC standard \nJESD216  that is published in 2011 . Most Winbond SpiFlash Memories shipped after June 2011 (date \ncode 1124 and beyond) support the SFDP feature as specified in the applicable datasheet.  \nThe Read SFDP instruction  is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “5Ah” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin. Eight “dummy” clocks are also required before the \nSFDP register contents are shifted out on the falling edge of the 4 0th CLK with most significant bit (MSB) \nfirst as shown in Figure  34. For SFDP register values and descriptions, please refer to the Winbond \nApplication Note for  SFDP Definition table.  \nNote: 1. A23 -A8 = 0; A7 -A0 are used to define the starting byte address  for the 256 -Byte SFDP Register.  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (5Ah)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\nDummy Byte\nHigh Impedance40 41 42 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7Data Out 2\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 043 31\n0\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 3 4.

These re gisters may be used by the system manufacturers to store security and other \nimportant information separately from the main memory array.  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction . A Write Enable \ninstruction must be executed before th e device will accept the Erase  Security Register  Instruction (Status \nRegister bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “ 44h” followed by a 24-bit address (A23 -A0) to erase one of the three  security register s.  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nThe Erase  Security Register  instruction sequence is shown in Figure 35. The /CS pin must be driven high \nafter the eighth bit of the last byte has been l atched. If this is not done the instruction will not  be executed. \nAfter /CS is dri ven high, the self -timed Erase  Security R egister operation  will commence for a time \nduration of t SE (See AC Characteristics). While the Erase Security Register cycle is in progress, the Read \nStatus Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is  \na 1 during the erase  cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept \nother instructions again. After the Erase  Security Register  cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch \n(WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0.  The Security Register Lock Bits  (LB3 -1) in the Status \nRegister -2 can be used to OTP protect the security registers. Once a lock bit is  set to 1, the corresponding  \nsecurity register will be permanently locked, Erase Security Register instruction to that re gister will be \nignored (See 1 1.1.9 for detail descriptions). \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (44h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 2 1 0\n*Mode 0Mode 3\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 35.

It allow s from one \nbyte to 256 bytes of security register data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) memory locations. \nA Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Program Security Register \nInstruction (Status Register bit WE L= 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting \nthe instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. \nThe /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction  while data is being sent to the device.  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nThe Program Sec urity Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 36.

Program  Security Registers Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \nW25Q64FV  \n \n- 66 -  7.2.38  Read Security Registers (48h)  \nThe Read Security Register  instruction is similar to the Fast Read  instruction and allows one or more data \nbytes to be sequentially read from one of the three  security registers. The instruction is initiated by driving \nthe /CS pin low and then shifting the instruction code “48h”  f ollowed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and \neight “dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the CLK \npin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out on \nthe DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The byte address is \nautomatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of data is shifted out . Once the byte \naddress reaches the last byte of the register (byte FFh),  it will reset to 00h, the first byte of the register, \nand continue to increment.  The instruction is completed by driving /CS high. The Read Security Register  \ninstruction sequence is shown in Figure 37. If a Read Security Register  instruction is issued whi le an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on the current cycle. The Read Security Register  instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a \nmaximum of FR (see AC Electrical Characterist ics).  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (48h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\nDummy Byte\nHigh Impedance40 41 42 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7Data Out 2\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 043 31\n0= MSB*\n \nFigure 37.

The dummy clocks \nfor various Fast Read instructions  in Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode  are fixed, please refer to the \nInstruction Table 7.2.2-7.2.4 for detail s. The “Wrap Length” is set by W5 -4 bit in the “Set Burst with Wrap  \n(77h) ” instruction. This setting will remain unchanged when the device is switched from Standard SPI \nmode to QPI mode.  \nThe default “Wrap Length” after a power up or a Reset instruction is 8 bytes, the default number of \ndummy clocks is 2.  The number of dummy clocks is only programmable for “Fast Read (0Bh)”, “Fast \nRead Quad I/O (EBh)” & “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instructions  in the QPI mode.

However, SPI mode and QPI mode can not be used at the same time. “Enable QPI (38h)” \ninstruction is the only way to switch the device from SPI mode to QPI mode.  \nUpon power -up, the default state of the device upon is Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. This  provides full \nbackward compatibility with earlier generations of Winbond serial flash memories. See Intruction Set \nTable 1 -3 for all supported SPI commands. In order to sw itch the device to QPI mode, the Quad Enable \n(QE) bit in Status Register 2 must be s et to 1 first, and an “Enable QPI (38h)” instruction must be issued. If \nthe Quad Enable (QE) bit is 0, the “Enable QPI (38h)” instruction will be ignored and the device will remain \nin SPI mode.  \nSee Instruction Set Table 4 for all the commands supported in QPI mode.  \nWhen the device is switched from SPI mode to QPI mode, the exsiting Write Enable and Program/Erase \nSuspend status, and the Wrap Length setting will remain unchanged.  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (38h)\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3\n \nFigure 40.

Once the Reset instruction is accepted, any \non-going internal operations will be terminated and the device will return to its default power -on state  and \nlose all the curren t volatile settings, such as Volatile Status Register bits, Write Enable Latch (WEL) \nstatus, Program/Erase Suspend status, Read parameter setting  (P7-P0), Continuous Read Mode bit \nsetting (M7 -M0) and Wrap Bit setting (W6 -W4).  \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Rese t (99h)” instructions can be issued in either SPI mode or QPI mode. To \navoid accidental reset, both instructions must be issued in sequen ce. Any other commands other than  \n“Reset (99h)” after the “Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the “Reset Enable”  state. A new \nsequence of “Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is needed to reset the device.  Once the Reset \ncommand is accepted by the device, the device will take approximately tRST=30us to reset. During this \nperiod, no command will be accepted.  \nData c orruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended internal Erase or Program  operation \nwhen Reset command sequence is accepted by the device. It is recommended to check the BUSY bit and \nthe SUS bit in Status Register before issuing the Reset command  sequence.  \nMode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (99h)Mode 0Mode 3/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (66h)\nHigh Impedance\n \nFigure 42a.
