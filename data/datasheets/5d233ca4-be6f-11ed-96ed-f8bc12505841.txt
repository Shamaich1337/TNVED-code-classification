The SN65HVD2x family \noperates over an extended range of common-mode \nvoltages and has features such as high ESD \nprotection, wide receiver hysteresis, and failsafe \noperation. This family of devices is designed for long-\ncable networks, and other applications where the \nenvironment is too harsh for ordinary transceivers.\nThese devices are designed for bidirectional data \ntransmission on multipoint twisted-pair cables. \nExample applications are digital motor controllers, \nremote sensors and terminals, industrial process \ncontrol, security stations, and environmental control \nsystems.\nThese devices combine a 3-state differential driver \nand a differential receiver that operate from a single \n5-V power supply. The driver differential outputs and \nthe receiver differential inputs are connected internally \nto form a differential bus port that offers minimum \nloading to the bus. This port features an extended \ncommon-mode voltage range, making the device \nsuitable for multipoint applications over long cable \nruns.\nPackage Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN65HVD2xSOIC (8) 4.90 mm × 3.91 mm\nPDIP (8) 9.81 mm × 6.35 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\n0.1110100\nHVD20HVD23\nHVD24\nHVD21\nHVD22Signaling□Rate□-□Mbps\n10 100 1000\nCable□Length□-□m\nSN65HVD2x Application Space\n-20 V +25 V\n-7□V +12 VSUPER485\nRS485\n-20□V -15□V -10□V -5□V 0 5□V 10□V 15□V 20□V 25□VSN65HVD2x Devices Operate Over a Wider \nCommon-Mode Voltage RangeSN65HVD20 , SN65HVD21 , SN65HVD22 , SN65HVD23 , SN65HVD24\nSLLS552G  – DECEMBER 2002 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The driver \noutput slew rate is controlled to provide reliable switching with shaped transitions which reduce high-frequency \nnoise emissions.\nThe SN65HVD22 device has controlled driver output slew rate for low radiated noise in emission-sensitive \napplications and for improved signal quality with long stubs. Up to 256 SN65HVD22 nodes can be connected at \nsignaling rates up to 500 kbps.\nThe SN65HVD23 device implements receiver equalization technology for improved jitter performance on \ndifferential bus applications with data rates up to 25 Mbps at cable lengths up to 160 meters.\nThe SN65HVD24 device implements receiver equalization technology for improved jitter performance on \ndifferential bus applications with data rates from 1 Mbps to 10 Mbps at cable lengths up to 1000 meters.\nThe receivers include a failsafe circuit that provides a high-level output within 250 microseconds after loss of the \ninput signal. The most common causes of signal loss are disconnected cables, shorted lines, or the absence of \nany active transmitters on the bus. This feature prevents noise from being received as valid data under these \nfault conditions. This feature may be used for Wired-OR bus signaling.\nThe SN65HVD2x devices are characterized for operation temperatures from –40°C to 85°C.\n6 Device Comparison\nTable 6-1.

The devices feature extended common-mode range support, which provides immunity to \nlarger ground potential differences that can occur between nodes that communicate over longer distances. \nThe SN65HVD23 and the SN65HVD24 devices feature receiver equalization, which reduces the amount of \ndata-dependent jitter that is introduced by the high-frequency losses associated with long cables.\n10.2 Functional Block Diagram\nBA6\n7R\n21\nRE\nDE\nD3\n4Active\nFilters++\n120 mV\n120 mVTimer\n250 s P(VA-VB) : Not High\n(VA-VB) : Not Low Bus Input\nInvalid\nSlew\nRate\nControlSTANDBY-\n-\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n10.3 Feature Description\nThe SN65HVD2x family of devices integrates a differential receiver and differential driver with additional features \nfor improved performance in electrically-noisy, long-cable, or other fault-intolerant applications.\nThe receiver hysteresis (typically 130 mV) is much larger than found in typical RS-485 transceivers. This helps \nreject spurious noise signals which would otherwise cause false changes in the receiver output state.\nSlew rate limiting on the driver outputs (SN65HVD2[1,2,4]) reduces the high-frequency content of signal edges. \nThis decreases reflections from bus discontinuities, and allows longer stub lengths between nodes and the \nmain bus line. Designers must consider the maximum signaling rate and cable length required for a specific \napplication, and choose the transceiver best matching those requirements.\nWhen DE is low, the differential driver is disabled, and the A and B outputs are in high-impedance states. When \nDE is high, the differential driver is enabled, and drives the A and B outputs according to the state of the D \ninputs.\nWhen RE is high, the differential receiver output buffer is disabled, and the R output is in a high-impedance \nstate. When RE is low, the differential receiver is enabled, and the R output reflects the state of the differential \nbus inputs on the A and B pins.SN65HVD20, SN65HVD21, SN65HVD22, SN65HVD23, SN65HVD24\nSLLS552G – DECEMBER 2002 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD20  SN65HVD21  SN65HVD22  SN65HVD23  SN65HVD24\nIf both the driver and receiver are disabled, (DE low and RE high) then all nonessential circuitry, including \nauxiliary functions such as failsafe and receiver equalization is placed in a low-power standby state. This \nreduces power consumption to less than 5 µW. When either enable input is asserted, the circuitry again \nbecomes active.\nIn addition to the primary differential receiver, these devices incorporate a set of comparators and logic to \nimplement an active receiver failsafe feature. These components determine whether the differential bus signal \nis valid. Whenever the differential signal is close to zero volts (neither high nor low), a timer initiates, If the \ndifferential input remains within the transition range for more than 250 µs, the timer expires and set the receiver \noutput to the high state. If a valid bus input (high or low) is received at any time, the receiver output reflects the \nvalid bus state, and the timer is reset.\nFigure 10-1.

This can \ncause loss of transmission of data during the period that the device is in the test-mode. The driver is re-enabled \nand resumes normal operation whenever the above conditions are not true. The device is not damaged by this \ntest mode.\nAlthough rare, there are combinations of specific voltage levels and input data patterns within the operating \nconditions of the SN65HVD2x family which may lead to a temporary state where the driver outputs are disabled \nfor a period of time.\nObservations:\n1.The conditions for inadvertently entering the test mode are dependent on the levels, duration, and duty cycle \nof the logic signal input to the D pin. Operating input levels are specified as greater than 2 V for a logic HIGH \ninput, and less than 0.8 V for a logic LOW input. Therefore, a valid steady-state logic input does not cause \nthe device to activate the test mode\n2.Only input signals with frequency content above 2 MHz (4 Mbps) have a possibility of activating the test \nmode. Therefore, this issue should not affect the normal operation of the SN65HVD22 (500 kbps).\n3.For operating signaling rates of 4 Mbps (or above), the conditions stated above must remain true over a \nperiod of: 4 Mbps ×100 µs = 400 bits. Therefore, a normal short message does not inadvertently activate the \ntest model.\n4.One example of an input signal which may cause the test mode to activate is a clock signal with frequency \n3 MHz and 50% duty cycle (symmetric HIGH and LOW half-cycles) with logic HIGH levels of 2.4 V and logic \nLOW levels of 0.4 V. This signal applied to the D pin as a driver input would meet the criteria listed above, \nand may cause the test-mode to activate, which would disable the driver. This example situation may occur if \nthe clock signal is generated from a microcontroller or logic chip with a 2.7-V supply.www.ti.comSN65HVD20, SN65HVD21, SN65HVD22, SN65HVD23, SN65HVD24\nSLLS552G – DECEMBER 2002 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD20  SN65HVD21  SN65HVD22  SN65HVD23  SN65HVD24\n10.4.2 Equivalent Input and Output Schematic Diagrams\n9 V1 kΩ100 k Ω\nInputVCCREInputs\n9 V1 kΩ\n100 k ΩInputVCCDE Input\n29 VR3R1\nR2InputA Input\n29 VR3R1\nR2InputB Input\n29 VVCCA and B Outputs\n9 VVCCR Output\n5Ω\nOutputVCC VCC\nOutputD Inputs (HVD20, 21, 22) D Inputs (HVD23, 24)\n29 V\nFigure 10-4.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n11.1 Application Information\nThe SN65HVD2x devices are half-duplex RS-485 transceivers that can be used for bidirectional, multipoint \ncommunication at various data rates over differential transmission lines. These devices support a wide common-\nmode range, allowing for robust communication even in the presence of voltage differences between the \nreference potentials of different nodes on a network.\n11.2 Typical Application\nFigure 11-1  shows a typical RS-485 application. Transceivers of different nodes are connected to one another \nover a shared bus. Twisted-pair cabling with a controlled differential impedance is used, and termination \nresistances are placed at the two ends of the cable to match the transmission line impedance and minimize \nsignal reflections.\nR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nBR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nBR\nDR\nRE\nDE\nDA\nB\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 11-1. Half-Duplex Transceiver Configurations\n11.2.1 Design Requirements\nAs the distances between nodes in an RS-485 network become greater and greater, it becomes more of a \nchallenge to ensure reliable communication. The increased distance often means that the reference (ground) \npotentials has more of a difference between nodes. These ground potential differences give rise to differences \nin the common-mode voltages seen by the various transceivers on the bus. Standard RS-485 transceivers are \ntypically specified to operate over a common-mode voltage from –7 V to 12 V, which may be insufficient for \nlarger distances. The SN65HVD2x family of devices extends this range to –20 V to 25 V, allowing for greater \ncommunication distances between nodes.\nIncreased cable lengths can lead to increased jitter, especially in links operating at high data rates. This \nincreased jitter is due to the attenuation of the cable, which tends to increase with frequency. Having unequal \nloss between higher and lower frequencies causes the RS-485 signal to distort, adding some timing deviation \n(jitter) to the edge crossings of the RS-485 data. If the jitter amplitude exceeds the jitter tolerance of the receiving \nMCU or UART, then bit errors are likely to result in the link. However, jitter can be reduced for a given link \nthrough the use of receiver equalization.\n11.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n11.2.2.1 Noise Considerations for Equalized Receivers\nThe simplest way of overcoming the effects of cable losses is to increase the sensitivity of the receiver. If \nthe maximum attenuation of frequencies of interest is 20 dB, increasing the receiver gain by a factor of ten \ncompensates for the cable. However, this means that signal and noise are amplified. Therefore, the receiver with www.ti.comSN65HVD20, SN65HVD21, SN65HVD22, SN65HVD23, SN65HVD24\nSLLS552G – DECEMBER 2002 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD20  SN65HVD21  SN65HVD22  SN65HVD23  SN65HVD24\nhigher gain is more sensitive to noise and it is important to minimize differential noise coupling to the equalized \nreceiver.\nDifferential noise is crated when conducted or radiated noise energy generates more voltage on one line of \nthe differential pair than the other. For this to occur from conducted or electric far-field noise, the impedance to \nground of the lines must differ.\nFor noise frequency out to 50 MHz, the input traces can be treated as a lumped capacitance if the receiver is \napproximately 10 inches or less from the connector. Therefore, matching impedance of the lines is accomplished \nby matching the lumped capacitance of each.\nThe primary factors that affect the capacitance of a trace are in length, thickness, width, dielectric material, \ndistance from the signal return path, stray capacitance, and proximity to other conductors. It is difficult to match \neach of the variables for each line of the differential pair exactly, but a reasonable effort to do so keeps the lines \nbalanced and less susceptible to differential noise coupling.\nAnother source of differential noise is from near-field coupling. In this situation, an assumption of equal noise-\nsource impedance cannot be made as in the far-field. Familiarly known as crosstalk, more energy from a nearby \nsignal is coupled to one line of the differential pair. Minimization of this differential noise is accomplished by \nkeeping the signal pair close together and physical separation from high-voltage, high-current, or high-frequency \nsignals.\nIn summary, follow these guidelines in board layout for keeping differential noise to a minimum.\n•Keep the differential input traces short.\n•Match the length, physical dimensions, and routing of each line of the pair.\n•Keep the lines close together.\n•Match components connected to each line.\n•Separate the inputs from high-voltage, high-frequency, or high-current signals.\n11.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 11-2  illustrates the benefits of integrated receiver equalization as implemented in the SN65HVD23 \ntransceiver. In this test setup, a differential signal generator applied a signal voltage at one end of the cable, \nwhich was Belden 3105A twisted-pair shielded cable. The test signal was a pseudo-random bit stream (PRBS) \nof nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) data. Channel 1 (top) shows the eye-pattern of the differential voltage at the receiver \ninputs (after the cable attenuation). Channel 2 (bottom) shows the output of the receiver.\nFigure 11-3  illustrates the benefits of integrated receiver equalization as implemented in the SN65HVD24 \ntransceiver.

This helps to reduce supply voltage ripple \npresent on the outputs of switched-mode power supplies and also helps to compensate for the resistance and \ninductance of the PCB power planes.www.ti.comSN65HVD20, SN65HVD21, SN65HVD22, SN65HVD23, SN65HVD24\nSLLS552G – DECEMBER 2002 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: SN65HVD20  SN65HVD21  SN65HVD22  SN65HVD23  SN65HVD24\n13 Layout\n13.1 Layout Guidelines\nIn addition to the guidelines on differential trace matching given in Section 11.2.2 , the layout guidelines below \nmust be followed:\n•Route power and ground nets as planes rather than traces, and keep their widths as large as possible to \nminimize resistance and inductance while maximizing parasitic capacitance.\n•If external components (like transient voltage suppression diodes) are used for transient protection, place \nthem close to the connector port and within the path of the signal lines. Make sure component capacitances \nare small enough not to impact the RS-485 signaling at the chosen data rate.\n•Small-valued series pulse-proof resistances can be used to provide additional immunity to transients. This \nis needed to limit input currents if the clamping voltages of external transient protection devices exceed the \nabsolute maximum ratings of the transceiver. These resistances must be less than 10 Ω so that the RS-485 \nsignal is not overly attenuated.\n13.2 Layout Example\nMCUR\nRVia to ground\nSN65HVD2x\nJMPR\nRRC RVia to V CC\nTVS\nFigure 13-1.
