D For more information www.analog.com Document FeedbackTYPICAL APPLICATIONFEATURES\nAPPLICATIONSDESCRIPTION3A, 4MHz Monolithic  \nSynchronous Step-Down \nDC/DC Converter\nThe LT C®3612 is a low quiescent current monolithic syn -\nchronous buck regulator using a current mode, constant \nfrequency architecture. The no-load DC supply current \nin sleep mode is only 70µA while maintaining the output \nvoltage (Burst Mode operation) at no load, dropping to \nzero current in shutdown. The 2.25V to 5.5V input sup -\nply voltage range makes the LTC3612 ideally suited for \nsingle Li-Ion as well as fixed low voltage input applica -\ntions. 100% duty cycle capability provides low dropout \noperation, extending the operating time in battery-pow -\nered systems. \nThe operating frequency is externally programmable up to \n4MHz, allowing the use of small surface mount inductors. \nFor switching noise-sensitive applications, the LTC3612 \ncan be synchronized to an external clock at up to 4MHz. \nForced continuous mode operation in the LTC3612  \nreduces noise and RF interference. Adjustable compen -\nsation allows the transient response to be optimized over \na wide range of loads and output capacitors.\nThe internal synchronous switch increases efficiency and \neliminates the need for an external catch diode, saving \nexternal components and board space. The LTC3612 is \noffered in a leadless 20-pin 3mm × 4mm QFN or a ther -\nmally enhanced 20-pin TSSOP package.\nEfficiency and Power Loss vs Load Currentn 3A Output Current\nn 2.25V to 5.5V Input Voltage Range\nn Low Output Ripple Burst Mode® Operation: I Q = 70µA\nn ±1% Output Voltage Accuracy\nn Output Voltage Down to 0.6V\nn High Efficiency: Up to 95%\nn Low Dropout Operation: 100% Duty Cycle\nn Shutdown Current: ≤1µA\nn Adjustable Switching Frequency: Up to 4MHz\nn Optional Active Voltage Positioning (AVP) with \nInternal Compensation\nn Selectable Pulse-Skipping/Forced Continuous/  \nBurst Mode Operation with Adjustable Burst Clamp\nn Programmable Soft-Start\nn Inputs for Start-Up T racking or External Reference\nn DDR Memory Mode, I OUT = ±1.5A \nn Available in Thermally Enhanced 20-Pin  \n(3mm × 4mm) QFN and TSSOP Packages\nn AEC-Q100 Qualified for Automotive Applications\nn Point-of-Load Supplies\nn Distributed Power Supplies\nn Portable Computer Systems\nn DDR Memory Termination\nn Handheld Devices\nRUN\nTRACK/SS\nRT/SYNC\nPGOOD\nITHSGND\nPGNDVIN\n2.5V TO 5.5V\nPVIN_DRV\nDDRSVIN\nL TC3612 SWPVIN\n560nH\n665k\n210k3612 TA01a22µF\n×2\nMODE VFB47µFVOUT\n2.5V\n3A\nOUTPUT CURRENT (mA)30EFFICIENCY (%)POWER LOSS (W)90100\n20\n1080\n5070\n60\n40\n1 100 1000 10000\n3612 TA01b010\n0.0011\n0.1\n0.01\n10VIN = 5V\nVIN = 3.3V\nVIN = 2.8VAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Exposure to any Absolute \nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device \nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: The LTC3612 is tested under pulsed load conditions such that  \nTJ ≈ TA. The LTC3612E is guaranteed to meet performance specifications \nfrom 0°C to 85°C junction temperature. Specifications over the \n–40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by \ndesign, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. \nThe LTC3612I is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating \njunction temperature range. The LTC3612H is guaranteed to meet \nspecifications over the –40°C to 150°C operating temperature range. The \nLTC3612MP is guaranteed and tested to meet specifications over the full \n–55°C to 150°C operating temperature range. Note that the maximum \nambient temperature consistent with these specifications is determined by \nspecific operating conditions in conjunction with board layout, the rated \npackage thermal impedance and other environmental factors. The junction \ntemperature  \n(TJ, in °C) is calculated from the ambient temperature (T A, in °C) and \npower dissipation (P D, in watts) according to the formula:\n TJ = TA + (P D • θJA), \nwhere θ JA (in °C/W) is the package thermal impedance.ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS The l denotes the specifications which apply over the specified operating \njunction temperature range, otherwise specifications are at T A = 25°C (Note 2).

D For more information www.analog.comMode Selection\nThe MODE pin is used to select one of four different oper -\nating modes:OPERATION\nMain Control Loop\nThe LTC3612 is a monolithic, constant frequency, current \nmode step-down DC/DC converter . During normal opera -\ntion, the internal top power switch (P-channel MOSFET) is \nturned on at the beginning of each clock cycle. Current in \nthe inductor increases until the current comparator trips \nand turns off the top power switch. The peak inductor cur -\nrent at which the current comparator trips is controlled by \nthe voltage on the ITH pin. The error amplifier adjusts the \nvoltage on the ITH pin by comparing the feedback signal \nfrom a resistor divider on the V FB pin with an internal 0.6V  \nreference. When the load current increases, it causes a \nreduction in the feedback voltage relative to the reference. \nThe error amplifier raises the ITH voltage until the average \ninductor current matches the new load current. Typical \nvoltage range for the ITH pin is from 0.1V to 1.05V with \n0.45V corresponding to zero current.\nWhen the top power switch shuts off, the synchronous \npower switch (N-channel MOSFET) turns on until either \nthe bottom current limit is reached or the next clock cycle \nbegins. The bottom current limit is typically set at –4A for \nforced continuous mode and 0A  for Burst Mode operation \nand pulse-skipping mode.\nThe operating frequency defaults to 2.25MHz when  \nRT/SYNC is connected to SV IN, or can be set by an exter -\nnal resistor connected between the RT/SYNC pin and \nground, or by a clock signal applied to the RT/SYNC pin. \nThe switching frequency can be set from 300kHz  to 4MHz.\nOvervoltage and undervoltage comparators pull the \nPGOOD output low if the output voltage varies typically \nmore than ±7.5% from the set point.

In Burst Mode operation \nthe internal power switches operate intermittently at light \nloads. This increases efficiency by minimizing switching \nlosses. During the intervals when the switches are idle, \nthe LTC3612  enters sleep state where many of the internal \ncircuits are disabled to save power . During Burst Mode \noperation, the minimum peak inductor current is internally \nclamped and the voltage on the ITH pin is monitored by \nthe burst comparator to determine when sleep mode is \nenabled and disabled. When the average inductor cur -\nrent is greater than the load current, the voltage on the \nITH pin drops. As the ITH voltage falls below the inter -\nnal clamp, the burst comparator trips and enables sleep \nmode. During sleep mode, the power MOSFETs are held \noff and the load current is solely supplied by the output \ncapacitor . When the output voltage drops, the top power \nswitch is turned back on and the internal circuits are re-\nenabled. This process repeats at a rate that is dependent \non the load current.\nLTC3612\n13\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nBurst Mode Operation—External Clamp\nConnecting the MODE pin to a voltage in the range of \n0.45V to 0.8V enables Burst Mode operation with exter -\nnal clamp. During this mode of operation the minimum \nvoltage on the ITH pin is externally set by the voltage on \nthe MODE pin. It is recommended to use Burst Mode \noperation with  an internal clamp for temperatures above \n85°C ambient. \nPulse-Skipping Mode Operation \nPulse-skipping mode is similar to Burst Mode operation, \nbut the LTC3612 does not disable power to the internal \ncircuitry during sleep mode. This improves output voltage \nripple but uses more quiescent current, compromising \nlight load efficiency.\nTying the MODE pin to SV IN enables pulse-skipping mode. \nAs the load current decreases, the peak inductor current \nwill be determined by the voltage on the ITH pin until the \nITH voltage drops below the voltage level corresponding \nto 0A. At this point, the peak inductor current is deter -\nmined by the minimum on-time of the current comparator . \nIf the load demand is less than the average of the mini -\nmum on-time inductor current, switching cycles will be \nskipped to keep the output voltage in regulation. \nForced Continuous Mode\nIn forced continuous mode the inductor current is con -\nstantly cycled which creates a minimum output voltage \nripple at all output current levels.\nConnecting the MODE pin to a voltage in the range of \n1.1V to SV IN • 0.58 will enable forced continuous mode \noperation.\nAt light loads, forced continuous mode operation is less \nefficient than Burst Mode or pulse-skipping operation, but \nmay be desirable in some applications where it is neces -\nsary to keep switching harmonics out of the signal band. \nForced continuous mode must be used if the output is \nrequired to sink current. Dropout Operation\nAs the input supply voltage approaches the output voltage, \nthe duty cycle increases toward the maximum on-time. \nFurther reduction of the supply voltage forces the main \nswitch to remain on for more than one cycle, eventually \nreaching 100% duty cycle. The output voltage will then be \ndetermined by the input voltage minus the voltage drop \nacross the internal P-channel MOSFET and the inductor .\nLow Supply Operation\nThe LTC3612 is designed to operate down to an input sup -\nply voltage of 2.25V. An important consideration at low \ninput supply voltages is that the R DS(ON)  of the P-channel \nand N-channel power switches increases. The user should \ncalculate the power dissipation when the LTC3612 is used \nat 100% duty cycle with low input voltages to ensure \nthat thermal limits are not exceeded. See the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics graphs.\nShort-Circuit Protection\nThe peak inductor current at which the current compara -\ntor shuts off the top power switch is controlled by the \nvoltage on the ITH pin.\nIf the output current increases, the error amplifier raises \nthe ITH pin voltage until the average inductor current \nmatches the new load current. In normal operation the \nLTC3612 clamps the maximum ITH pin voltage at approxi -\nmately 1.05V which corresponds typically to 6A peak \ninductor current.\nWhen the output is shorted to ground, the inductor cur -\nrent decays very slowly during a single switching cycle. \nThe LTC3612 uses two techniques to prevent current run -\naway from occurring. \nLTC3612\n14\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATIONIf the output voltage drops below 50% of its nominal \nvalue, the clamp voltage at ITH pin is lowered causing \nthe maximum peak inductor current to decrease gradually \nwith the output voltage. When the output voltage reaches \n0V the clamp voltage at the ITH pin drops to 40% of the \nclamp voltage during normal operation. The short-circuit \npeak inductor current is determined by the minimum on-\ntime of the LTC3612, the input voltage and the inductor \nvalue. This foldback behavior helps in limiting the peak inductor current when the output is shorted to ground. It \nis disabled during internal or external soft-start and track -\ning up/down operation (see the Applications Information \nsection).\nA secondary limit is also imposed on the valley induc -\ntor current. If the inductor current measured through the \nbottom MOSFET increases beyond 6A typical, the top \npower MOSFET will be held off and switching cycles will \nbe skipped until the inductor current is reduced.OPERATION\nThe basic LTC3612 application circuit is shown in Figure\xa01.\nOperating Frequency\nSelection of the operating frequency is a trade-off between \nefficiency and component size. High frequency operation \nallows the use of smaller inductor and capacitor values.\nOperation at lower frequencies improves efficiency by \nreducing internal gate charge losses but requires larger \ninductance values and/or capacitance to maintain low \noutput ripple voltage.\nThe operating frequency of the LTC3612 is determined \nby an external resistor that is connected between the RT/\nSYNC pin and ground.

D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFrequency Synchronization\nThe LTC3612’s internal oscillator can be synchronized to \nan external frequency by applying a square wave clock \nsignal to the RT/SYNC pin. During synchronization, the \ntop switch turn-on is locked to the falling edge of the \nexternal frequency source. The synchronization frequency \nrange is 300kHz to 4MHz. During synchronization all \noperation modes can be selected.\nIt is recommended that the regulator is powered down \n(RUN pin to ground) before removing the clock signal \non the RT/SYNC pin in order to reduce inductor current \nripple.\nAC coupling should be used if the external clock genera -\ntor cannot provide a continuous clock signal throughout \nstart-up, operation and shutdown of the LTC3612. The \nsize of capacitor C SYNC depends on parasitic capacitance \non the RT/SYNC pin and is typically in the range of 10pF \nto 22pFInductor Selection\nFor a given input and output voltage, the inductor value \nand operating frequency determine the ripple current. The \nripple current ∆ IL increases with higher V IN and decreases \nwith higher inductance:\n ΔIL=VOUT\nfSW•L⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•1–VOUT\nVIN⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nHaving a lower ripple current reduces the core losses \nin the inductor , the ESR losses in the output capacitors \nand the output voltage ripple. A reasonable starting point \nfor selecting the ripple current is ∆I L = 0.3 • I OUT(MAX) . \nThe largest ripple current occurs at the highest V IN. To \nguarantee that the ripple current stays below a specified \nmaximum, the inductor value should be chosen according \nto the following equation:\n L=VOUT\nfSW•ΔIL(MAX)⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•1–VOUT\nVIN⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nThe inductor value will also have an effect on Burst Mode \noperation. The transition to low current operation begins \nwhen the peak inductor current falls below a level set by \nthe burst clamp. Lower inductor values result in higher \nripple current which causes this to occur at lower load \ncurrents. This causes a dip in efficiency in the upper \nrange of low current operation. In Burst Mode operation, \nlower inductance values will cause the burst frequency \nto increase.\nInductor Core Selection\nOnce the value for L is known, the type of inductor must be \nselected. Actual core loss is independent of core size for fixed \ninductor value, but it is very dependent on the inductance \nselected. As the inductance increases, core losses decrease. \nUnfortunately, increased inductance requires more turns of \nwire and therefore, copper losses will increase.\nFerrite designs have very low core losses and are pre -\nferred at high switching frequencies, so design goals \ncan concentrate on copper loss and preventing satura -\ntion. Ferrite core material saturates “hard,” meaning that \ninductance collapses abruptly when the peak design cur -\nrent is exceeded.

Do not allow a ferrite core to saturate and select \nexternal inductors respecting the temperature range of \nthe application!\nDifferent core materials and shapes will change the size/\ncurrent and price/current relationship of an inductor . \nToroid or shielded pot cores in ferrite or permalloy mate -\nrials are small and do not radiate much energy, but gen -\nerally cost more than powdered iron core inductors with \nsimilar characteristics. The choice of which style inductor \nto use mainly depends on the price versus size require -\nments and any radiated field/EMI requirements. Table\xa01 \nshows some typical surface mount inductors that work \nwell in LTC3612 applications.\nInput Capacitor (C IN) Selection\nIn continuous mode, the source current of the top \nP-channel MOSFET is a square wave of duty cycle V OUT/\nVIN. To prevent large voltage transients, a low ESR capaci -\ntor sized for the maximum RMS current must be used at \nVIN.\nThe maximum RMS capacitor current is given by:\n IRMS=IOUT(MAX)•VOUT\nVIN•VIN\nVOUT–1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nThis formula has a maximum at V IN = 2VOUT , where I RMS \n= IOUT/2. This simple worst-case condition is commonly \nused for design because even significant deviations do \nnot offer much relief. Note that ripple current ratings from \ncapacitor manufacturers are often based on only 2000 \nhours of life which makes it advisable to further derate \nthe capacitor , or choose a capacitor rated at a higher \ntemperature than required.

The output ripple \n∆VOUT is determined by:\n ΔVOUT≤ΔIL•ESR+1\n8•fSW•COUT⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nwhere f OSC = operating frequency, C OUT = output capaci -\ntance and ∆IL = ripple current in the inductor . The out-\nput ripple is highest at maximum input voltage since ∆I L \nincreases with input voltage. \nIn surface mount applications, multiple capacitors may \nhave to be paralleled to meet the capacitance, ESR or \nRMS current handling requirement of the application. \nAluminum electrolytic, special polymer , ceramic and dry \ntantalum capacitors are all available in surface mount \npackages.\nTantalum capacitors have the highest capacitance density, \nbut can have higher ESR and must be surge tested for \nuse in switching power supplies. Aluminum electrolytic \ncapacitors have significantly higher ESR, but can often \nbe used in extremely cost-sensitive applications provided \nthat consideration is given to ripple current ratings and \nlong term reliability. \nCeramic Input and Output Capacitors\nCeramic capacitors have the lowest ESR and can be cost \neffective, but also have the lowest capacitance density, \nhigh voltage and temperature coefficients, and exhibit \naudible piezoelectric effects. In addition, the high-Q of \nceramic capacitors along with trace inductance can lead \nto significant ringing. \nThey are attractive for switching regulator use because \nof their very low ESR, but great care must be taken when \nusing only ceramic input and output capacitors.\nCeramic capacitors are prone to temperature effects \nwhich require the designer to check loop stability over \nthe operating temperature range. To minimize their large \ntemperature and voltage coefficients, only X5R or X7R \nceramic capacitors should be used. When a ceramic capacitor is used at the input and the \npower is being supplied through long wires, such as from \na wall adapter , a load step at the output can induce ringing \nat the V IN pin. At best, this ringing can couple to the output \nand be mistaken as loop instability. At worst, the ringing \nat the input can be large enough to damage the part.\nSince the ESR of a ceramic capacitor is so low, the input \nand output capacitor must instead fulfill a charge stor -\nage requirement. During a load step, the output capaci -\ntor must instantaneously supply the current to support \nthe load until the feedback loop raises the switch current \nenough to support the load. The time required for the \nfeedback loop to respond is dependent on the compensa-\ntion components and the output capacitor size. Typically, \n3 to 4 cycles are required to respond to a load step, but \nonly in the first cycle does the output drop linearly. The \noutput droop, V DROOP , is usually about 2 to 4 times the \nlinear drop of the first cycle; however , this behavior can \nvary depending on the compensation component values. \nThus, a good place to start is with the output capacitor \nsize of approximately:\n COUT≈3.5•ΔIOUT\nfSW•VDROOP\nThis is only an approximation;  more capacitance may \nbe needed depending on the duty cycle and load step \nrequirements.\nIn most applications, the input capacitor is merely required \nto supply high frequency bypassing, since the impedance \nto the supply is very low.\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe output voltage is set by an external resistive divider \naccording to the following equation:\n VOUT=0.6•1+R1\nR2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\xa0V\nThe resistive divider allows pin V FB to sense a fraction of \nthe output voltage, as shown in Figure\xa01.\nLTC3612\n18\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comBurst Clamp Programming\nIf the voltage on the MODE pin is less than 0.8V, Burst \nMode operation is enabled. \nIf the voltage on the MODE pin is less than 0.3V, the inter -\nnal default burst clamp level is selected. The minimum \nvoltage on the ITH pin is typically 525mV (internal clamp).\nIf the voltage is between 0.45V and 0.8V, the voltage on \nthe MODE pin (V BURST ) is equal to the minimum voltage \non the ITH pin (external clamp) and determines the burst \nclamp level I BURST  (typically from 0A to 3.5A). \nWhen the ITH voltage falls below the internal (or external) \nclamp voltage, the sleep state is enabled.\nAs the output load current drops, the peak inductor cur -\nrent decreases to keep the output voltage in regulation. \nWhen the output load current demands a peak induc -\ntor current that is less than I BURST , the burst clamp will \nforce the peak inductor current to remain equal to I BURST  \nregardless of further reductions in the load current. \nSince the average inductor current is greater than the out -\nput load current, the voltage on the ITH pin will decrease. \nWhen the ITH voltage drops, sleep mode is enabled in \nwhich both power switches are shut off along with most \nof the circuitry to minimize power consumption. All cir -\ncuitry is turned back on and the power switches resume \noperation when the output voltage drops out of regulation. \nThe value for I BURST  is determined by the desired amount \nof output voltage ripple. As the value of I BURST  increases, \nthe sleep period between pulses and the output voltage \nripple increase. Note that for very high V BURST  voltage \nsettings, the power good comparator may trip, since the \noutput ripple may get bigger than the power good window.\nPulse-skipping mode, which is a compromise between \nlow output voltage ripple and efficiency, can be imple-\nmented by connecting MODE to SV IN. This sets I BURST  to \n0A. In this condition, the peak inductor current is limited \nby the minimum on-time of the current comparator . The \nlowest output voltage ripple is achieved while still operat -\ning discontinuously. During very light output loads, pulse \nskipping allows only a few switching cycles to skip while \nmaintaining the output voltage in regulation.Internal and External Compensation \nThe regulator loop response can be checked by looking at \nthe load current transient response. Switching regulators \ntake several cycles to respond to a step in DC load cur -\nrent. When a load step occurs, V OUT shifts by an amount \nequal to ∆ ILOAD(ESR) , where ESR is the effective series \nresistance of C OUT . ∆ILOAD also begins to charge or dis -\ncharge C OUT , generating the feedback error signal that \nforces the regulator to adapt to the current change and \nreturn V OUT to its steady-state value. During this recov -\nery time V OUT can be monitored for excessive overshoot \nor ringing, which would indicate a stability problem. The \navailability of the ITH pin allows the transient response \nto be optimized over a wide range of output capacitance.\nThe ITH external components (R C and C C) shown in \nFigure\xa01 provide adequate compensation as a starting \npoint for most applications. The values can be modified \nslightly to optimize transient response once the final PCB \nlayout is done and the particular output capacitor type and \nvalue have been determined. The output capacitors need \nto be selected because the various types and values deter -\nmine the loop gain and phase. The gain of the loop will be \nincreased by increasing R C and the bandwidth of the loop \nwill be increased by decreasing C C. If R C is increased by \nthe same factor that C C is decreased, the zero frequency \nwill be kept the same, thereby keeping the phase shift the \nsame in the most critical frequency range of the feedback \nloop. The output voltage settling behavior is related to the \nstability of the closed-loop system. The external capacitor , \nCC1, (Figure\xa01) is not needed for loop stability, but it helps \nfilter out any high frequency noise that may couple onto \nthat node. The general purpose buck regulator application \nin the Typical Applications section uses a faster compen -\nsation to improve load step response.\nA second, more severe transient is caused by switching \nin loads with large (>1μF) supply bypass capacitors. The \ndischarged bypass capacitors are effectively put in parallel \nwith C OUT , causing a rapid drop in V OUT . No regulator can \nalter its delivery of current quickly enough to prevent this \nsudden step change in output voltage if the load switch \nresistance is low and it is driven quickly. More output \ncapacitance may be required depending on the duty cycle \nand load step requirements.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC3612\n19\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAVP Mode\nFast load transient response, limited board space and low \ncost are typical requirements of microprocessor power \nsupplies. A microprocessor has typical full load step with \nvery fast slew rate. The voltage at the microprocessor \nmust be held to about ±0.1V of nominal in spite of these \nload current steps. Since the control loop cannot respond \nthis fast, the output capacitors must supply the load cur -\nrent until the control loop can respond.\nNormally, several capacitors in parallel are required to \nmeet microprocessor transient requirements. Capacitor \nESR and ESL primarily determine the amount of droop or \novershoot in the output voltage. \nConsider the LTC3612 without AVP with a bank of tanta -\nlum output capacitors. If a load step with very fast slew \nrate occurs, the voltage excursion will be seen in both \ndirections, for full load to minimum load transient and \nfor the minimum load to full load transient. \nIf the ITH pin is tied to SV IN, the active voltage position -\ning (AVP) mode and internal compensation are selected.\nAVP mode intentionally compromises load regulation by \nreducing the gain of the feedback circuit, resulting in an \noutput voltage that varies with load current. When the \nload current suddenly increases, the output voltage starts \nfrom a level slightly higher than nominal so the output \nvoltage can droop more and stay within the specified volt -\nage range. When the load current suddenly decreases the \noutput voltage starts at a level lower than nominal so the \noutput voltage can have more overshoot and stay within \nthe specified voltage range (see Figure\xa03 and Figure\xa04).APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa04.

Alternatively, the output volt -\nage filter capacitance can be reduced while maintaining \nthe same peak to peak transient response. Due to the \nreduced loop gain in AVP mode, no external compensa -\ntion is required.\nDDR Mode\nThe LTC3612 can both source and sink current if the \nMODE pin is configured to forced continuous mode. \nCurrent sinking is typically limited to 1.5A, for 1MHz fre -\nquency and a 1µH inductor , but can be lower at higher \nfrequencies and low output voltages. If higher ripple cur -\nrent can be tolerated, smaller inductor values can increase \nthe sink current limit.

After \npulling the RUN pin high, the chip enters a soft start-up \nstate. This type of soft start-up behavior is set by the \nTRACK/SS pin: \n1.  Tying TRACK/SS to SV IN selects the internal soft-start \ncircuit. This circuit ramps the output voltage to the final \nvalue within 1ms.\n2.  If a longer soft-start period is desired, it can be set \nexternally with a resistor and capacitor on the TRACK/\nSS pin, as shown in Figure\xa0 1.

It is \noften useful to analyze individual losses to determine what \nis limiting the efficiency and which change would produce \nthe most improvement. Efficiency can be expressed as:\n Efficiency = 100% – (L1 + L2 + L3 + ...)\nwhere L1, L2, etc. are the individual losses as a percent -\nage of input power .\nAlthough all dissipative elements in the circuit produce \nlosses, two main sources usually account for most of \nthe losses: V IN quiescent current and I2R losses. The V IN \nquiescent current loss dominates the efficiency loss at \nvery low load currents whereas the I2R loss dominates \nthe efficiency loss at medium to high load currents. In a \ntypical efficiency plot, the efficiency curve at very low load \ncurrents can be misleading since the actual power lost is \nusually of no consequence.\n1. The V IN quiescent current is due to two compo -\nnents:  the DC bias current as given in the Electrical \nCharacteristics and the internal main switch and syn -\nchronous switch gate charge currents. The gate charge \ncurrent results from switching the gate capacitance of \nthe internal power MOSFET switches. Each time the \ngate is switched from low to high to low again, a packet \nof charge dQ moves from V IN to ground. The resulting \ndQ/dt is the current out of V IN due to gate charge, and \nit is typically larger than the DC bias current. Both the \nDC bias and gate charge losses are proportional to V IN; \nthus, their effects will be more pronounced at higher \nsupply voltages.\n2. I2R losses are calculated from the resistances of the \ninternal switches, R SW , and external inductor , R L. In \ncontinuous mode the average output current flowing \nthrough inductor L is “ chopped”  between the main \nswitch and the synchronous switch. Thus, the series \nresistance looking into the SW pin is a function of both \ntop and bottom MOSFET R DS(ON)  and the duty cycle \n(DC) as follows:\n  R SW = (R DS(ON)TOP )(DC) + (R DS(ON)BOT )(1 – DC)\nLTC3612\n22\nRev.

To obtain I2R losses, simply \nadd R SW to R L and multiply the result by the square of \nthe average output current.\n Other losses including C IN and C OUT ESR dissipative \nlosses and inductor core losses generally account for \nless than 2% of the total loss.\nThermal Considerations\nIn most applications, the LTC3612 does not dissipate \nmuch heat due to its high efficiency.\nHowever , in applications where the LTC3612 is running \nat high ambient temperature with low supply voltage and \nhigh duty cycles, such as in dropout, the heat dissipated \nmay exceed the maximum junction temperature of the \npart. If the junction temperature reaches approximately \n160°C, both power switches will be turned off and the SW \nnode will become high impedance.\nTo prevent the LT C3612  from exceeding the maximum \njunction temperature, some thermal analysis is required. \nThe temperature rise is given by:\n T RISE = (P D)(θJA)\nwhere P D is the power dissipated by the regulator and \nθJA is the thermal resistance from the junction of the die \nto the ambient temperature. The junction temperature, \nTJ, is given by:\n T J = TA + TRISE\nwhere T A is the ambient temperature.\nAs an example, consider the case when the LTC3612 is in \ndropout at an input voltage of 3.3V with a load current of \n3A at an ambient temperature of 70°C. From the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics  graph of Switch Resistance, \nthe R DS(ON)  resistance of the P- channel switch is 0.075Ω. \nTherefore, power dissipated by the part is:\n P D = (I OUT)2 • RDS(ON)  = 675mW\nFor the QFN package, the θ JA is 43°C/ W.Therefore, the junction temperature of the regulator oper -\nating at 70°C ambient temperature is approximately:\n T J = 0.675W • 43°C/W + 70°C = 99°C\nWe can safely assume that the actual junction temperature \nwill not exceed the absolute maximum junction tempera -\nture of 125°C.\nNote that for very low input voltage, the junction tempera -\nture will be higher due to increased switch resistance, \nRDS(ON) . It is not recommended to use full load current \nfor high ambient temperature and low input voltage.\nTo maximize the thermal performance of the LTC3612 the \nExposed Pad should be soldered to a ground plane.
