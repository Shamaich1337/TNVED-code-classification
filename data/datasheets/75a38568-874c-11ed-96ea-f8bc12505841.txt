This allows direct interfacing to low-voltage ASIC/FPGAs without extra components. TheMAX13430E–MAX13433E RS-485 transceivers operatewith a V\nCCvoltage supply from +3V to +5V. The low-\nvoltage logic interface operates with a voltage supplyfrom +1.62V to V\nCC.\nThe MAX13430E–MAX13433E are ±30kV ESD-protect-ed RS-485 transceivers with one driver and one receiv-er. All devices have a 1/8-unit load receiver inputimpedance, allowing up to 256 transceivers on the bus.These devices include fail-safe circuitry, guaranteeinga logic-high receiver output when receiver inputs areopen or shorted. The receivers output a logic-high if alltransmitters on a terminated bus are disabled (highimpedance). All devices feature hot-swap capability toeliminate false transitions on the bus during power-upor hot insertion.\nThe MAX13430E/MAX13432E feature reduced slew-\nrate drivers that minimize EMI and reduce reflectionscaused by improperly terminated cables, allowingerror-free data transmission up to 500kbps. TheMAX13431E/MAX13433E driver slew rates are not limit-ed, enabling data transmission up to 16Mbps.\nThe MAX13430E–MAX13433E transceivers draw 2mA\nof supply current when unloaded or when fully loadedwith the drivers disabled. The MAX13430E/MAX13431E are intended for half-duplex communica-tions, and the MAX13432E/MAX13433E are intendedfor full-duplex communications.\nLow-Voltage Logic Interface\nVLis the voltage supply for the low-voltage logic inter-\nface and receiver output. V Loperates with voltage sup-\nply from +1.62V to V CC.\nFail Safe\nThe MAX13430E family guarantees a logic-high receiv-er output when the receiver inputs are shorted or open,or when they are connected to a terminated transmis-sion line with all drivers disabled. This is done by set-ting the receiver input threshold between -50mV and-200mV. If the differential receiver input voltage (A - B)is greater than or equal to -50mV, RO is logic-high.If (A - B) is less than or equal to -200mV, RO is logic-low. In the case of a terminated bus with all transmittersdisabled, the receiver’s differential input voltage ispulled to 0V by the termination. With the receiverthresholds of the MAX13430E family, this results in alogic-high with a 50mV minimum noise margin. The-50mV to -200mV threshold complies with the ±200mVEIA/TIA/RS-485 standard.\nHot-Swap Capability\nWhen circuit boards are inserted into a hot or poweredbackplane, differential disturbances to the data bus canlead to data errors. Upon initial circuit-board insertion,the data communication processor undergoes its ownpower-up sequence. During this period, the processor’slogic-output drivers are high impedance and are unableto drive the DE and RE inputs of these devices to a\ndefined logic level. Leakage currents up to ±10µA fromthe high-impedance state of the processor’s logic driverscould cause standard CMOS enable inputs of a trans-ceiver to drift to an incorrect logic level. Additionally, par-asitic circuit-board capacitance could cause coupling ofV\nLor GND to the enable inputs. Without the hot-swap\ncapability, these factors could improperly enable thetransceiver’s driver or receiver. When V\nLrises, an inter-\nnal pulldown circuit holds DE low and RE high. After the\ninitial power-up sequence, the pulldown circuit becomestransparent, resetting the hot-swap tolerable input.\n±30kV ESD Protection\nESD-protection structures are incorporated on all pinsto protect against electrostatic discharges encoun-tered during handling and assembly. The driver out-puts and receiver inputs of the MAX13430E family ofdevices have extra protection against static electricity.Maxim’s engineers have developed state-of-the-art structures to protect these pins against ESD of±30kV without damage. The ESD structures withstandhigh ESD in all states: normal operation, shutdown,and powered down. After an ESD event, theMAX13430E–MAX13433E keep working without latchupor damage. ESD protection can be tested in variousways. The transmitter outputs and receiver inputs of theMAX13430E–MAX13433E are characterized for protec-tion to the following limits:\n• ±30kV using the Human Body Model\n• ±10kV using the Contact Discharge method specified\nin IEC 61000-4-2\n• ±15kV using the Air Gap Discharge method specified\nin IEC 61000-4-2\nMAX13430E–MAX13433E\nMaxim Integrated\n15\nRS-485 Transceivers with Low-Voltage\nLogic Interface\nESD Test Conditions\nESD performance depends on a variety of conditions.\nContact Maxim for a reliability report that documentstest setup, test methodology, and test results.\nHuman Body Model\nFigure 10a shows the Human Body Model, and Figure10b shows the current waveform it generates when dis-charged into a low impedance. This model consists of a100pF capacitor charged to the ESD voltage of interest,which is then discharged into the test device through a1.5kΩ resistor.\nIEC 61000-4-2\nThe IEC 61000-4-2 standard covers ESD testing andperformance of finished equipment. However, it doesnot specifically refer to integrated circuits. TheMAX13430E family of devices helps you design equip-ment to meet IEC 61000-4-2, without the need for addi-tional ESD-protection components.\nThe major difference between tests done using the\nHuman Body Model and IEC 61000-4-2 is higher peakcurrent in IEC 61000-4-2 because series resistance islower in the IEC 61000-4-2 model. Hence, the ESD with-stand voltage measured to IEC 61000-4-2 is generallylower than that measured using the Human BodyModel. Figure 10c shows the IEC 61000-4-2 model, andFigure 10d shows the current waveform for IEC 61000-4-2 ESD Contact Discharge test.\nCHARGE-CURRENT-\nLIMIT RESISTORDISCHARGE\nRESISTANCE\nSTORAGE\nCAPACITORCs\n100pFRC \n1MΩRD \n1500Ω\nHIGH-\nVOLTAGE\nDC\nSOURCEDEVICE\nUNDER\nTEST\nFigure 10a.

The MAX13430E family of trans-ceivers has a 1/8-unit load receiver input impedance(96kΩ), allowing up to 256 transceivers to be connect-ed in parallel on one communication line. Any combina-tion of these devices, as well as other RS-485transceivers with a total of 32-unit loads or less, can beconnected to the line.\nReduced EMI and Reflections\nThe MAX13430E/MAX13432E feature reduced slew-rate drivers that minimize EMI and reduce reflectionscaused by improperly terminated cables, allowingerror-free data transmission up to 500kbps.Driver Output Protection\nTwo mechanisms prevent excessive output current andpower dissipation caused by faults or by bus con-tention. The first, a foldback current limit on the outputstage, provides immediate protection against short cir-cuits over the whole common-mode voltage range (seethe \nTypical Operating Characteristics .) The second, a\nthermal-shutdown circuit, forces the driver outputs intoa high-impedance state if the die temperature exceeds+150°C (typ).\nTypical Applications\nThe MAX13430E/MAX13433E transceivers aredesigned for bidirectional data communications on mul-tipoint bus transmission lines. Figures 11 and 12 showtypical network applications circuits. To minimize reflec-tions, terminate the line at both ends with its character-istic impedance, and keep stub lengths off the mainline as short as possible. The slew-rate-limitedMAX13430E/MAX13432E allow the RS-485 network tobe more tolerant of imperfect termination.\nMAX13430E–MAX13433E\nMaxim Integrated\n17\nRS-485 Transceivers with Low-Voltage\nLogic Interface\nFigure 12.
