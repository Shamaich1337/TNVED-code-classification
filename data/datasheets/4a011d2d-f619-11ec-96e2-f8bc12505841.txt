In all cases, however, readers are encouraged to verify \nthat they have the latest information before finalizing their design. The following descriptions of Spansion data \nsheet designations are presented here to highlight their presence and definitions.\nAdvance Information\nThe Advance Information designation indicates that Spansion Inc. is developing one or more specific \nproducts, but has not committed any design to production. Information pr esented in a document with this \ndesignation is likely to change, and in some cases, development on the product may discontinue. Spansion \nInc. therefore places the following c onditions upon Advance Information content:\n“This document contains information on one or mo re products under development at Spansion Inc. \nThe information is intended to help you evaluate th is product. Do not design in this product without \ncontacting the factory. Spansion Inc. reserves t he right to change or discont inue work on this proposed \nproduct without notice.”\nPreliminary\nThe Preliminary designation indicates that the produc t development has progressed such that a commitment \nto production has taken place. This designation covers  several aspects of the product life cycle, including \nproduct qualification, initial produc tion, and the subsequent phases in t he manufacturing process that occur \nbefore full production is achieved. Changes to the technical specifications presented in a Preliminary \ndocument should be expected while keeping these as pects of production under consideration. Spansion \nplaces the following conditions upon Preliminary content:\n“This document states the current technical sp ecifications regarding the Spansion product(s) \ndescribed herein. The Preliminary status of this document indicates that product qualification has been \ncompleted, and that initial production has begun. Due to the phases of the manufacturing process that \nrequire maintaining efficiency and quality, this doc ument may be revised by subsequent versions or \nmodifications due to changes in  technical specifications.”\nCombination\nSome data sheets contain a combination of products  with different designations (Advance Information, \nPreliminary, or Full Production). This type of docum ent distinguishes these prod ucts and their designations \nwherever necessary, typically on the first page, t he ordering information page, and pages with the DC \nCharacteristics table and the AC Erase and Program ta ble (in the table notes). The disclaimer on the first \npage refers the reader to the notice on this page.\nFull Production (No Designation on Document)\nWhen a product has been in production for a period of time such that no changes or only nominal changes are expected, the Preliminary designation is remove d from the data sheet. Nominal changes may include \nthose affecting the number of ordering part numbers available, such as t he addition or deletion of a speed \noption, temperature range, package type, or V\nIO range. Changes may also include those needed to clarify a \ndescription or to correct a typographical error or incorre ct specification.

General Description\nThe Spansion S34ML01G1, S34M L02G1, and S34ML04G1 series is offered in 3.3 VCC and VCCQ power \nsupply, and with x8 or x16 I/O interfac e. Its NAND cell provides the most cost-effective solution for the solid \nstate mass storage market. The memory is divided into blocks that can be erased independently so it is \npossible to preserve valid data while old data is erased . The page size for x8 is (2048 + 64 spare) bytes; for \nx16 (1024 + 32) words.\nEach block can be programmed and erased up to 10 0,000 cycles with ECC (error correction code) on. To \nextend the lifetime of NAND flash devices, the implementation of an ECC is mandatory.\nThe chip supports CE# don\'t care function. This functi on allows the direct download of the code from the \nNAND flash memory device by a microcontroller, since the CE# transitions do not stop the read operation.\nThe devices have a Read Cache feature that improves the read throughput for large files. During cache \nreading, the devices load the data in a cache register while the previous data is transferred to the I/O buffers \nto be read.\nLike all other 2-kB page NAND flash devices, a progra m operation typically writes 2112 bytes (x8), or 1056 \nwords (x16) in 200 µs and an erase operation can typically be performed in 2 ms (S34ML01G1) on a 128-kB \nblock (x8) or 64-kword block (x16). In addition, thanks to multiplane archit ecture, it is possible to program two \npages at a time (one per plane) or to erase two blo cks at a time (again, one per plane). The multiplane \narchitecture allows program time to be reduc ed by 40% and erase time to be reduced by 50%.\nIn multiplane operations, data in the page can be read out at 25 ns cycle time per byte. The I/O pins serve as \nthe ports for command and address input as well as data input/output. This interface allows a reduced pin \ncount and easy migration towards different densitie s, without any rearrang ement of t he footprint.\nCommands, Data, and Addresses are asynchronously in troduced using CE#, WE#, ALE, and CLE control \npins.\nThe on-chip Program/Erase Controller automates all read, program, and erase functions including pulse \nrepetition, where required, and internal verification and margining of data. A WP# pin is available to provide \nhardware protection against pr ogram and erase operations. \nThe output pin R/B# (open drain buffer) signals the status of the device durin g each operation. It identifies if \nthe program/erase/read controller is currently active. The use of an open-drain ou tput allows the Ready/Busy \npins from several memories to connect  to a single pull-up re sistor. In a system with multiple memories the \nR/B# pins can be connected all toget her to provide a global status signal.\nThe Reprogram function allows the optimization of  defective block management — when a Page Program \noperation fails the data can be directly programmed in another page inside the same array section without the time consuming serial data insertion phase. The Copy Back operation automat ically executes embedded \nerror detection operation: 1-bit error out of every 528 byte s (x8) or 256 words (x16) c an be detected. With this \nfeature it is no longer necessary to use an extern al mechanism to detect Copy Back operation errors.\nMultiplane Copy Back is also supported. Data read out a fter Copy Back Read (both for single and multiplane \ncases) is allowed.\nIn addition, Cache Program and Multiplane Cache Prog ram operations improve the programing throughput by \nprograming data using the cache register.\nThe devices provide two innovative features: Page Reprogram and Multiplane Page Reprogram. The Page \nReprogram re-programs one page. Normally, this operation is performed after a failed Page Program \noperation. Similarly, the Multiplane Page Reprogram re -programs two pages in parallel, one per plane. The \nfirst page must be in the first plane while the second page must be in the second plane. The Multiplane Page \nReprogram operation is performed after a failed Multip lane Page Program operatio n. The Page Reprogram \nand Multiplane Page Reprogram guarantee improved per formance, since data insertion can be omitted \nduring re-program operations.\nNote : The S34ML01G1 device does not support EDC.\n10 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \nThe devices come with an OTP (one time programmabl e) area, which is a restricted access area where \nsensitive data/code can be st ored permanently. This security feature is subject to an NDA (non-disclosure \nagreement) and is, therefore, not described in the da ta sheet.

Bus Operation\nThere are six standard bus operations  that control the device: Command Input, Address I nput, Data Input, \nData Output, Write Prot ect, and Standby. (See Table 1.6 .)\nTypically glitches less than 5 ns on Chip Enable, Writ e Enable, and Read Enable are ignored by the memory \nand do not affect bus operations.\n2.1 Command Input\nThe Command Input bus operation is used to give  a command to the memory device. Commands are \naccepted with Chip Enable low, Command Latch Enable high, Address Latch Enable low, and Read Enable \nhigh and latched on the rising edge of Write Enable. Mo reover, for commands that start a modify operation \n(program/erase) the Write Protect pin must be high. See Figure 6.1 on page 43  and Table 5.4 on page 41  for \ndetails of the timing requirements.  Command codes are always applied on I/O7:0 regardless of the bus \nconfiguration (x8 or x16).\n2.2 Address Input\nThe Address Input bus operation allows the inserti on of the memory address. For the S34ML02G1 and \nS34ML04G1 devices, five write cycles are needed to in put the addresses. For the S34ML01G1, four write \ncycles are needed to input the addresses. If nece ssary, a 5th dummy address cycle can be issued to \nS34ML01G1, which will be ignored by the NAND devi ce without causing problems. Addresses are accepted \nwith Chip Enable low, Address Latch Enable high, Co mmand Latch Enable low, and Read Enable high and \nlatched on the rising edge of Write Enable. Moreover, for commands that start a modify operation (program/\nerase) the Write Protect pin must be high. See Figure 6.2 on page 44  and Table 5.4 on page 41  for details of \nthe timing requirements. Addresses are always applied on I/O7:0 regardless of the bus configuration (x8 or \nx16). Refer to Table 1.3  through Table 1.5 on page 17  for more detailed information.Table 1.6  Mode Selection\nMode CLE ALE CE# WE# RE# WP#\nRead ModeCommand Input High Low Low Rising High X\nAddress Input Low High Low Rising High X\nProgram or Erase ModeCommand Input High Low Low Rising High High\nAddress Input Low High Low Rising High High\nData Input Low Low Low Rising High High\nData Output (on going) Low Low Low High Falling XData Output (suspended) X X X High High X\nBusy Time in Read X X X High High (3) X\nBusy Time in Program X X X X X HighBusy Time in Erase X X X X X High\nWrite Protect X X X X X Low\nStand By X X High X X 0V / V\nCC (2)\nFebruary 10, 2014 S34ML01G1_04G1_17 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded 19Data Sheet\n \n2.3 Data Input\nThe Data Input bus operation allows the data to be program med to be sent to the device. The data insertion is \nserial and timed by the Write Enable cycles. Data is accepted only with Chip Enable low, Address Latch \nEnable low, Command Latch Enable low, Read Enable  high, and Write Protect high and latched on the rising \nedge of Write Enable. See Figure 6.3 on page 44  and Table 5.4 on page 41  for details of the timing \nrequirements.\n2.4 Data Output\nThe Data Output bus operation allows data to be read from the memory array and to check the Status Register content, the EDC register content, and the ID data. Data can be serially shifted out by toggling the \nRead Enable pin with Chip Enable low, Write Enable high, Address Latch Enable low, and Command Latch \nEnable low. See Figure 6.4 on page 45  and Table 5.4 on page 41  for details of the timings requirements.\n2.5 Write Protect\nThe Hardware Write Protection is activated when the Wr ite Protect pin is low. In this condition, modify \noperations do not start and the content of the memory is not altered. The Write Prot ect pin is not latched by \nWrite Enable to ensure the pr otection even during power up.\n2.6 Standby\nIn Standby, the device is deselected, outputs are disabled, and power consumption is reduced.\n20 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \n3.

Two types of operations  are available: random read and serial page read. \nRandom read mode is enabled when the page address is  changed. All data within the selected page are \ntransferred to the data r egisters. The system controlle r may detect the completion  of this data transfer (tR) by \nanalyzing the output of the R/B pin. Once the data in  a page is loaded into the data registers, they may be \nread out in 25 ns cycle time by sequentially pulsing RE #. The repetitive high to low transitions of the RE# \nsignal makes the device output the data, starting fr om the selected column address up to the last column \naddress.\nThe device may output random data in a page instead of  the sequential data by writing Random Data Output \ncommand. The column address of next data, which is going to be out, may be changed to the address that \nfollows Random Data Output command. Random Data Output can be performed as many times as needed.\nAfter power up, the device is in read mode, so 00h comm and cycle is not necessary to start a read operation. \nAny operation other than read or Random Data Output causes the device to exit read mode.\nSee Figure 6.6 on page 46  and Figure 6.12 on page 49  as references.\n3.2 Page Program\nA page program cycle consists of a serial data loading period in which up to 2112 bytes (x8) or 1056 words \n(x16) of data may be loaded into the data register, fo llowed by a non-volatile programming period where the \nloaded data is programmed into the appropriate cell.\nThe serial data loading period begins by inputting the Se rial Data Input command (80h), followed by the five \ncycle address inputs (four cycles for S34ML01G1) and then  serial data. The words other than those to be \nprogrammed do not need to be loaded. The device suppo rts Random Data Input within a page. The column \naddress of next data, which will be entered, may be chan ged to the address that follows the Random Data \nInput command (85h). Random Data Input ma y be performed as many times as needed.\nThe Page Program confirm command (10h) initiates th e programming process. The internal write state \ncontroller automatically executes the algorithms and controls timings necessary  for program and verify, \nthereby freeing the system controller for other tasks.\nOnce the program process starts, the Read Status Regi ster commands (70h or 78h) may be issued to read \nthe Status Register. The system cont roller can detect the co mpletion of a program cycle by monitoring the \nR/B# output, or the Status bit (I/O6) of the Status Register. Only the Read  Status commands (70h or 78h) or \nReset command are valid while programming is in progr ess. When the Page Program  is complete, the Write \nStatus Bit (I/O0) may be checked. The internal write veri fy detects only errors for 1’ s that are not successfully \nprogrammed to 0’s. The command register remain s in Read Status command mode until another valid \ncommand is written to the command register. Figure 6.9 on page 47  and Figure 6.11 on page 48  detail the \nsequence.\nThe device is programmable by page, but it also allo ws multiple partial page programming of a word or \nconsecutive bytes up to 2112 bytes (x8) or 1056 words (x16) in a single page program cycle.\nThe number of consecutive partial page programming operations (NOP ) within the same page must not \nexceed the number indicated in Table 5.7 on page 43 . Pages may be programmed in any order within a \nblock.\nUsers who use “EDC check” (for S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G 1 only) in copy back must comply with some \nlimitations related to data handling during one page program sequence. Refer to Section 3.8 on page 26  for \ndetails.\nIf a Page Program operation is interrupted by hardware reset, power failure or other means, the host must \nensure that the interrupted page is not used for furt her reading or programming operations until the next \nuninterrupted block erase is complete.\n22 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \n3.3 Multiplane Program — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThe S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1 devices support Multipl ane Program, making it possible to program two \npages in parallel, one page per plane.\nA Multiplane Program cycle consists of a double serial data loading period in which up to 4224 bytes (x8) or \n2112 words (x16) of data may be loaded into the data register, followed by a non-volatile programming period \nwhere the loaded data is programmed into the appropriate  cell. The serial data loading period begins with \ninputting the Serial Data Input command (80h), followed by the five cycle address inputs and serial data for \nthe 1st page. The address for this page must be in the 1st plane (PLA0 = 0). The device supports Random \nData Input exactly the same as in the case of pag e program operation. The Dummy Page Program Confirm \ncommand (11h) stops 1st page data input and the device becomes busy for a short time (tDBSY ). Once it has \nbecome ready again, the ‘81h’ command must be issued, followed by 2nd page address (5 cycles) and its \nserial data input. The address for this page must be in the 2nd plane (PLA0 = 1). The Program Confirm \ncommand (10h) starts parallel programming of both pages. \nFigure 6.13 on page 49  describes the sequences using the legacy protocol. In this case, the block address \nbits for the first plane are all zero and the second  address issued selects the block for both planes. \nFigure 6.14 on page 50  describes the sequences using the ONFI pr otocol. For both addresses issued in this \nprotocol, the block address bits must be the same  except for the bit(s) that select the plane.\nThe user can check operation status by monitoring R/B# pin or reading the Status Register (command 70h or \n78h). The Read Status Register command is  also available during Dummy Busy time (tDBSY ). In case of \nfailure in either page program, the fail bit of  the Status Register will be set. Refer to Section 3.9 on page 28  for \nfurther info.\nThe number of consecutive partial page programming operations (NOP ) within the same page must not \nexceed the number indicated in Table 5.7 on page 43 . Pages may be programmed in any order within a \nblock.\nIf a Multiplane Program operation is interrupted by hard ware reset, power failure or other means, the host \nmust ensure that the interrupted pages are not used fo r further reading or progra mming operations until the \nnext uninterrupted block erases are co mplete for the applicable blocks.\nFebruary 10, 2014 S34ML01G1_04G1_17 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded 23Data Sheet\n \n3.4 Page Reprogram — S3 4ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nPage Program may result in a fail, which can be detected  by Read Status Register. In this event, the host \nmay call Page Reprogram. This command allows the reprog ramming of the same pattern of the last (failed) \npage into another memory location. The command sequen ce initiates with reprogram setup (8Bh), followed \nby the five cycle address inputs of the target page. If th e target pattern for the destination page is not changed \ncompared to the last page, the program confirm can be issued (10h) without any data input cycle, as \ndescribed in Figure 3.1 .\nFigure 3.1  Page Reprogram\nOn the other hand, if the pa ttern bound for the target page is different from that of the pr evious page, data in \ncycles can be issued before program confirm ‘10h’, as described in Figure 3.2 .\nFigure 3.2  Page Reprogram with Data ManipulationSR[6]I/OxCycle TypeAs defined for P age\nProgr amA\nAC1 I/Ox\nSR[6]Cycle Type CMD ADDR ADDR ADDR\n00h C2 R1 R3\nPage NDin Din Din Din CMD\nD0 D1 . . .

The column address of next data, which will be \nentered, may be changed to the address which follows  the Random Data Input command (85h). Random \nData Input may be operated multiple times regardless of how many times it is done in a page.\nThe Program Confirm command (10h) initiates the re -programming process. The internal write state \ncontroller automatically executes the algorithms and controls timings necessary  for program and verify, \nthereby freeing the system co ntroller for other tasks. Once the program process starts, the Read Status \nRegister command may be issued to read the Status Register. The system controller can detect the \ncompletion of a program cycle by monitoring the R/B# out put, or the Status bit (I/O6)  of the Status Register. \nOnly the Read Status command and Reset command are va lid when programming is in progress. When the \nPage Program is complete, the Write St atus Bit (I/O0) may be checked. The internal write verify detects only \nerrors for 1’s that are not successfully programmed to  0’s. The command register remains in Read Status \ncommand mode until another valid command is written to the command register.\nThe Page Reprogram must be issued in the same plane as  the Page Program that failed. In order to program \nthe data to a different plane, use the Page Program o peration instead. The Multiplane Page Reprogram can \nre-program two pages in parallel, one per plane. T he Multiplane Page Reprogram operation is performed \nafter a failed Multiplane Page Program operation.  The command sequence is very similar to Figure 6.13 \non page 49 , except that it requires the Page Reprogram Command (8Bh) instead of 80h and 81h.\nIf a Page Reprogram operation is interrupted by hardware  reset, power failure or other means, the host must \nensure that the interrupted page is not used for furt her reading or programming operations until the next \nuninterrupted block erase is complete.\n3.5 Block Erase\nThe Block Erase operation is done on a block basis. Bl ock address loading is accomplished in three cycles \n(two cycles for S34ML01G1) initiat ed by an Erase Setup command (60h). Only the block address bits are \nvalid while the page address bits are ignored.\nThe Erase Confirm command (D0h) following the block addr ess loading initiates the internal erasing process. \nThis two-step sequence of setup followed by the exec ution command ensures that memory contents are not \naccidentally erased due to external noise conditions.\nAt the rising edge of WE# after the erase confirm comma nd input, the internal write controller handles erase \nand erase verify. Once the erase process starts, the Read Status Register commands (70h or 78h) may be \nissued to read the Status Register.\nThe system controller can detect the completion of an er ase by monitoring the R/B# output, or the Status bit \n(I/O6) of the Status Register. Only the Read Status  commands (70h or 78h) and Reset command are valid \nwhile erasing is in progress. When the erase operati on is completed, the Write Status Bit (I/O0) may be \nchecked. Figure 6.15 on page 50  details the sequence.\nIf a Block Erase operation is interrupted by hardware reset, power failure or other means, the host must \nensure that the interrupted block is erased under c ontinuous power conditions before that block can be \ntrusted for further programming and reading operations.\nFebruary 10, 2014 S34ML01G1_04G1_17 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded 25Data Sheet\n \n3.6 Multiplane Block Erase — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nMultiplane Block Erase allows the erase of two blocks in parallel, one block per memory plane.\nThe Block erase setup command (60h) must be repeated two times, followed by 1st and 2nd block address \nrespectively (3 cycles each). As for block erase, D0h command makes embedded operation start. In this \ncase, multiplane erase does not need any Dummy Busy Time between 1st and 2nd block insertion. See \nTable 5.7 on page 43  for performance information. \nFor the Multiplane Block Erase operation, the address of the first block must be within the first plane \n(PLA0 = 0) and the address of the second block in the second plane (PLA0 = 1). See Figure 6.16 on page 51  \nfor a description of the legacy protocol . In this case, the block address bits for the first plane are all zero and \nthe second address issued selects the block for both planes. Figure 6.17 on page 51  describes the \nsequences using the ONFI protocol. For both addresses issued in this protocol, the block address bits must \nbe the same except for the bit(s) that select the plane.\nThe user can check operation status by monitoring R/B# pin or reading the Status Register (command 70h or \n78h). The Read Status Register command is  also available during Dummy Busy time (tDBSY ). In case of \nfailure in either erase, the fail bit of t he Status Register will be set. Refer to Section 3.9 on page 28  for further \ninformation.\nIf a Multiplane Block Erase operation is interrupted by hardware reset, power failure or other means, the host \nmust ensure that the interrupted blocks are erased  under continuous power conditions before those blocks \ncan be trusted for further progr amming and reading operations.\n3.7 Copy Back Program\nThe copy back feature is intended to quickly and effici ently rewrite data stored in one page without utilizing an \nexternal memory. Since the time-con suming cycles of serial access an d re-loading cycles are removed, the \nsystem performance is greatly improved. The benefit is es pecially obvious when a portion of a block needs to \nbe updated and the rest of the block also needs to be  copied to the newly assigned free block. The operation \nfor performing a copy back is a sequential execution of page-read (without mandatory serial access) and \nCopy Back Program with the address of destination page.  A read operation with the ‘35h’ command and the \naddress of the source page moves the whole page of data into the internal data register. As soon as the \ndevice returns to the Ready state, optional da ta read-out is allowed by toggling RE# (see Figure 6.18 \non page 52 ), or the Copy Back Program command (85h) with  the address cycles of the destination page may \nbe written. The Program Confirm command (10h)  is required to actually begin programming.\nThe source and the destination pages in the Copy Ba ck Program sequence must belong to the same device \nplane (same PLA0 for S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1). Copy Back Read and Copy Back Program for a given \nplane must be between odd address pages or between even address pages for the device to meet the program time (t\nPROG ) specification. Copy Back Program may not meet this specificat ion when copying from \nan odd address page (source page) to an even address page (target page) or from an even address page \n(source page) to an odd address page (target page).\nThe data input cycle for modifying a port ion or multiple distin ct portions of the source page is allowed as \nshown in Figure 6.19 on page 52 . As noted in Section 1. on page 9  the device may include an automatic EDC \n(for S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1) check during the copy back operation, to detect single bit errors in EDC \nunits contained within the source page. More details on  EDC operation and limitations related to data input \nhandling during one Copy Back Program sequence are available in Section 3.8 on page 26 .\nIf a Copy Back Program operation is interrupted by ha rdware reset, power failure or other means, the host \nmust ensure that the interrupted page is not used for further reading or programming operations until the next \nuninterrupted block erase is complete.\n26 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \n3.7.1 Multiplane Copy Back Progr am — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThe device supports Multiplane Copy Back Program with  exactly the same sequenc e and limitations as the \nPage Program. Multiplane Copy Back Program must  be preceded by two single page Copy Back Read \ncommand sequences (1st page must be read from the 1st plane and 2nd page from the 2nd plane).\nMultiplane Copy Back cannot cross plane boundaries — the contents of the source page of one device plane \ncan be copied only to a destination page of the same plane. EDC check is available also for Multiplane Copy \nBack Program only for S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1.\nWhen “EDC check” is used in copy ba ck, it must comply with some limitat ions related to data handling during \none Multiplane Copy Back Program sequence. Please refer to Section 3.8 on page 26  for details on EDC \noperation. The Multiplane Copy Back Program sequence represented in Figure 6.20 on page 53  shows the \nlegacy protocol. In this case, the block address bits for the first plane are all zero and the second address \nissued selects the block for both planes. Figure 6.21 on page 54  describes the sequence using the ONFI \nprotocol. For both addresses issued in this protocol, the block address bits must be  the same except for the \nbit(s) that select the plane.\nIf a Multiplane Copy Back Program operation is interrup ted by hardware reset, power failure or other means, \nthe host must ensure that the interrupt ed pages are not used for further reading or programming operations \nuntil the next uninterrupted block eras es are complete for the applicable blocks.\n3.7.2 Special Read for Copy Back — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThe S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1 devices support Special Read for Copy Back. If Copy Back Read \n(described in Section 3.7  and Section 3.7.1 on page 26 ) is triggered with confirm command ‘36h’ instead \n‘35h’, Copy Back Read from target page(s) will be executed with an increased internal (VPASS) voltage.\nThis special feature is used in order to minimize t he number of read errors due to over-program or read \ndisturb — it shall be used only if ECC read errors have occurred in the source page using Page Read or Copy \nBack Read sequences.\nExcluding the Copy Back Read confirm command, all other features described in Section 3.7  and \nSection 3.7.1  for standard copy back remain valid (including the figures referred to in those sections).\n3.8 EDC Operation — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nError Detection Code check is a feature that can be us ed during the copy back operation (both single and \nmultiplane) to detect single bit errors occurring in the source page(s).\nNote : The S34ML01G1 device does not support EDC.\n\uf06eEDC check allows detection of up to 1 single bit error every 528 bytes, where each 528 byte group is \ncomposed of 512 bytes of main array and 16 bytes of spare area (see Table 3.3  and Table 3.4 \non page 28 ). The described 528-byte area is called an “EDC unit.”\n\uf06eIn the x16 device, EDC allows detection of up to 1 single bit error every 264 words, where each 264 word \ngroup is composed by 256 words of main array and 8 words of spare area see Table 3.3  and Table 3.4 \non page 28 ). The described 264-word area is called “EDC unit. ”\nEDC results can be checked through a specific Read ED C register command, available only after issuing a \nCopy Back Program or a Multiplane Copy Back Program. The EDC register can be queried during the copy \nback program busy time (tPROG ).\nFor the “EDC check” feature to operate correctly, specific  conditions on data input handling apply for program \noperations.\nFor the case of Page Program, Multiplane Page Progra m, Page Reprogram, Multiplane Page Reprogram, \nCache Program, and Multiplane Cache Program operations:\n\uf06eIn Section 3.2 on page 21  it was explained that a number of consecutive partial program operations (NOP) \nis allowed within the same page. In case this feature is used, the number of partial program operations \noccurring in the same EDC unit must not exceed 1. In other words, page program operations must be performed on the whole page, or on whole EDC unit at a time.\n\uf06e“Random Data Input” in a given EDC unit can be executed several times during one page program \nsequence, but data cannot be written to any column address more than once before the program is \ninitiated.\nFebruary 10, 2014 S34ML01G1_04G1_17 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded 27Data Sheet\n \nFor the case of Copy Back Program or Multiplane Copy Back Program operations:\n\uf06eIf Random Data Input is applied in a given EDC unit, the entire EDC unit must be wr itten to the page buffer. \nIn other words, the EDC check is possible only if the whole EDC unit is modified during one Copy Back \nProgram sequence.\n\uf06e“Random Data Input” in a given EDC unit can be executed several times during one Copy Back Program \nsequence, but data insertion in each column address of the EDC unit must not exceed 1.\nIf you use copy back without  EDC check, none of the limit ations described above apply.\nAfter a Copy Back Program operation, the host can use Read EDC Status Register to check the status of \nboth the program operation and the Copy Back Read. If  the EDC was valid and an error was reported in the \nEDC (see Table 3.2 on page 27 ), the host may perform Special Read For Copy Back on the source page and \nattempt the Copy Back Program again. If this also fails, the host can execute a Page Read operation in order \nto correct a single bit error with external ECC software or hardware.\n3.8.1 Read EDC Stat us Register — S3 4ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThis operation is available only after issuing a Copy Ba ck Program and it allows the detection of errors during \nCopy Back Read. In the case of mult iplane copy back, it is not possible to know which of the two read \noperations caused the error.\nAfter writing the Read EDC Status Register command (7Bh) to the command register, a read cycle outputs \nthe content of the EDC Register to the I/O pins on the falling edge of CE# or RE#, whichever occurs last.\nThe operation is the same as the Read Status Register command.

After writing 70h \ncommand to the command register, a read  cycle outputs the content of the Stat us Register to the I/O pins on \nthe falling edge of CE# or RE#, whichever occurs last. This two-line control allows the system to poll the \nprogress of each device in multiple memory connection s even when R/B# pins are common-wired. Refer to \nSection 3.5 on page 29  for specific Status Register definition, and to Figure 6.22 on page 54  for timings.\nIf the Read Status Register  command is issued during multiplane ope rations then Status Register polling will \nreturn the combined status value related to the outcome  of the operation in the two planes according to the \nfollowing table:\nIn other words, the Status Register  is dynamic; the user is not requir ed to toggle RE# / CE# to update it.\nThe command register remains in Status Read mode until further commands are i ssued. Therefor e, if the \nStatus Register is read during a random read cycle, the read command (00h) must  be issued before starting \nread cycles.\nNote: The Read Status Register command shall not be  used for concurrent operations in multi-die stack \nconfigurations (single CE#). “Read Status Enhanced” shall be used instead.\n3.10 Read Status Enhanced — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nRead Status Enhanced is used to retrieve the status  value for a previous operation in the specified plane.\nFigure 6.23 on page 55  defines the Read Status Enhanced behavio r and timings. The plane and die address \nmust be specified in the command sequence in order to re trieve the status of the di e and the plane of interest.\nRefer to Table 3.5  for specific Status Register definitions. The command register remains in Status Read \nmode until further commands are issued.\nThe Status Register is dynamic; the user is not required to toggle RE# / CE# to update it.Table 3.4  Page Organization in EDC Units by Address\nSectorMain Field (Column 0-2047) Spare Field (Column 2048-2111)\nArea Name Column Address Area Name Column Address\nx8\n1st 528-byte Sector A 0-511 E 2048-2063\n2nd 528-byte Sector B 512-1023 F 2064-2079\n3rd 528-byte Sector C 1024-1535 G 2080-2095\n4th 528-byte Sector D 1536-2047 H 2096-2111\nx16\n1st 256-word Sector A 0-255 E 1024-1031\n2nd 256-word Sector B 256-511 F 1032-1039\n3rd 256-word Sector C 512-767 G 1040-1047\n4th 256-word Sector D 768-1023 H 1048-1055\nStatus Register Bit Composite Status Value\nBit 0, Pass/Fail OR\nBit 1, Cache Pass/Fail OR\nFebruary 10, 2014 S34ML01G1_04G1_17 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded 29Data Sheet\n \n3.11 Read Status Register Field Definition\nTable 3.5  below lists the meaning of each bit of the R ead Status Register an d Read Status Enhanced \n(S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1).\n3.12 Reset\nThe Reset feature is executed by writing FFh to the command register. If the device is in the Busy state \nduring random read, program, or erase mode, the Rese t operation will abort these operations. The contents \nof memory cells being altered are no longer valid, as  the data may be partially programmed or erased. The \ncommand register is cleared to wait for the next comman d, and the Status Register is cleared to value E0h \nwhen WP# is high or value 60h when WP# is low. If the device is already in reset state a new Reset \ncommand will not be accepted by the command regi ster. The R/B# pin transitions to low for tRST after the \nReset command is written. Refer to Figure 6.24 on page 55  for further details. The Status Register can also \nbe read to determine the st atus of a Reset operation.\n3.13 Read Cache\nRead Cache can be used to increase the read operation speed, as defined in Section 3.1 on page 21 , and it \ncannot cross a block boundary. As soon as the user starts to read one page, the device automatically loads \nthe next page into the cache register. Serial data outpu t may be executed while data in the memory is read \ninto the cache register. Read Cache is initiated by the Page Read sequence (00-30h) on a page M.\nAfter random access to the first page is complete (R /B# returned to high, or Read Status Register I/O6 \nswitches to high), two command sequences  can be used to continue read cache:\n\uf06eRead Cache (command ‘31h’ only): once the comm and is latched into the command register (see \nFigure 6.26 on page 56 ), device goes busy for a short time (tCBSYR ), during which data of the first page is \ntransferred from the data register to the cache register. At t he end of this phase, the cache register data \ncan be output by toggling RE# while the next page (pag e address M+1) is read from the memory array into \nthe data register.\n\uf06eRead Cache Enhanced (sequence ‘00h’ <page N addre ss> ‘31’): once the command is latched into the \ncommand register (see Figure 6.27 on page 57 ), device goes busy for a short time (tCBSYR ), during which \ndata of the first page is transferred from the data regi ster to the cache register. At the end of this phase, \ncache register data can be output by toggling RE# while page N is read from the memory array into the \ndata register. \nNote : The S34ML01G1 device does not support Read Cache Enhanced.Table 3.5  Status Register Coding\nIDPage \nProgram / \nPage \nReprogramBlock Erase Read Read CacheCache \nProgram / \nCache \nReprogramCoding\n0 Pass / Fail Pass / Fail NA NA Pass / FailN Page\nPass: 0 \nFail: 1\n1 NA NA NA NA Pass / FailN - 1 Page\nPass: 0 \nFail: 1\n2N A N A N A N A N A —\n3N A N A N A N A N A —\n4N A N A N A N A N A —\n5 Ready / Busy Ready / Busy Ready / Busy Ready / Busy Ready / BusyInternal Data Operation \nActive: 0\nIdle: 1\n6 Ready / Busy Ready / Busy Ready / Busy Ready / Busy Ready / BusyReady / Busy\nBusy: 0 \nReady: 1\n7 Write Protect Write Protect NA NA Write ProtectProtected: 0\nNot Protected: 1\n30 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \nSubsequent pages are read by issuing additional Read Cache or Read Cache Enhanced command \nsequences. If serial data output time of one page exceeds random access time (tR), the random access time \nof the next page is hidden by data downloading of the previous page.\nOn the other hand, if 31h is issued prior to completi ng the random access to the next page, the device will \nstay busy as long as needed to complete random access to this page, transfer its contents into the cache \nregister, and trigger the random access to the following page.\nTo terminate the Read Cache operation, 3Fh command should be issued (see Figure 6.28 on page 57 ). This \ncommand transfers data from the data register to the cache register without issuing next page read.\nDuring the Read Cache operation, the device doesn\'t  allow any other command except for 00h, 31h, 3Fh, \nRead SR, or Reset (FFh). To carry out other operati ons, Read Cache must be terminated by the Read Cache \nEnd command (3Fh) or the device must be reset by issuing FFh.\nRead Status command (70h) may be issued to check t he status of the different registers and the busy/ready \nstatus of the cached read operations.\n\uf06eThe Cache-Busy status bit I/O6 indicates when the cache register is ready to output new data.\n\uf06eThe status bit I/O5 can be used to determine when the cell reading of the current data register contents is \ncomplete.\nNote : The Read Cache and Read Cache End commands re set the column counter, thus, when RE# is \ntoggled to output the data of a given page, the first output data is related to the first byte of the page (column \naddress 00h). Random Data Output command can be used to switch column address.\n3.14 Cache Program\nCache Program can improve the program throughput by using the cache register. The Cache Program \noperation cannot cross a block boundary. The cache regist er allows new data to be input while the previous \ndata that was transferred to the data register is programmed into the memory array.\nAfter the serial data input command (80h) is loaded to the command register, followed by five cycles of \naddress, a full or partial page of data is latched into the cache register.\nOnce the cache write command (15h) is loaded to the command register, the data in the cache register is \ntransferred into the data register for cell programming. At  this time the device remains in the Busy state for a \nshort time (tCBSYW ). After all data of the cache r egister is transferred into the data register, the device returns \nto the Ready state and allows loading the next data in to the cache register through another Cache Program \ncommand sequence (80h-15h).\nThe Busy time following the first sequence 80h - 15h equals the time needed to transfer the data from the \ncache register to the data register. Cell programming the data of the data register and loading of the next data \ninto the cache register is consequently processed through a pipeline model.\nIn case of any subsequent sequence 80h - 15h, transfer from the cache register to the data register is held off \nuntil cell programming of current data register contents is complete; till this moment the device will stay in a \nbusy state (tCBSYW ).\nRead Status commands (70h or 78h) may be issued to check the status of the di fferent regist ers, and the \npass/fail status of the cached program operations.\n\uf06eThe Cache-Busy status bit I/O6 indicates when the cache register is ready to accept new data.\n\uf06eThe status bit I/O5 can be used to determine when the cell programming of the current data register \ncontents is complete.\n\uf06eThe Cache Program error bit I/O1 can be used to identify if the previous page (page N-1) has been \nsuccessfully programmed or not in a Cache Program opera tion. The status bit is valid upon I/O6 status bit \nchanging to 1.\n\uf06eThe error bit I/O0 is used to identify if any error has been detected by the program/erase controller while \nprogramming page N. The status bit is valid upon I/O5 status bit changing to 1.\nI/O1 may be read together with I/O0.\nFebruary 10, 2014 S34ML01G1_04G1_17 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded 31Data Sheet\n \nIf the system monitors the progress of the operation only with R/B#, t he last page of the target program \nsequence must be programmed with Page Progra m Confirm command (10h). If the Cache Program \ncommand (15h) is used instead, the status bit I/O5 mu st be polled to find out if the last programming is \nfinished before starting any  other operation. See Table 3.5 on page 29  and Figure 6.29 on page 58  for more \ndetails.\nIf a Cache Program operation is interrupted by hardwar e reset, power failure or other means, the host must \nensure that the interrupted pages are not used for fu rther reading or programming operations until the next \nuninterrupted block eras es are complete for the applicable blocks.\n3.15 Multiplane Cache Program  — S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1\nThe Multiplane Cache Program enables high program throughput by programming two pages in parallel, \nwhile exploiting the data and cache regist ers of both planes to implement cache.\nThe command sequence can be summarized as follows:\uf06eSerial Data Input command (80h), followed by the fi ve cycle address inputs and then serial data for the 1st \npage. Address for this page must be within 1st plane  (PLA0 = 0). The data of 1s t page other than those to \nbe programmed do not need to be loaded. The device  supports Random Data Input exactly like Page \nProgram operation.\n\uf06eThe Dummy Page Program Confirm command (11h) stops 1st page data input and the device becomes \nbusy for a short time (t\nDBSY ).\n\uf06eOnce device returns to ready again, 81h command  must be issued, followed by 2nd page address \n(5 cycles) and its serial data input. Address for this page  must be within 2nd plane (PLA0 = 1). The data of \n2nd page other than those to be programmed do not need to be loaded.\n\uf06eCache Program confirm command (15h). Once the cac he write command (15h) is loaded to the command \nregister, the data in the cach e registers is transferred into the data registers for cell programming. At this \ntime the device remains in the Busy state for a short time (tCBSYW ). After all data from the cache registers \nare transferred into the data registers, the device re turns to the Ready state, and allows loading the next \ndata into the cache register through another Cache Program command sequence.\nThe sequence 80h-...- 11h...-...81h...-...15h can be iterat ed, and each time the device will be busy for the \ntCBSYW  time needed to complete programming the current data register contents, and transferring the new \ndata from the cache registers. The sequence to end Multiplane Cache Program is 80h-...- 11h...-...81h...-\n...10h. \nThe Multiplane Cache Program is available only within  two paired blocks in  separate planes. Figure 6.30 \non page 59  shows the legacy protocol for the Multiplane Ca che Program operation. In this case, the block \naddress bits for the first plane are all zero and the second address issued selects the block for both planes. Figure 6.31 on page 60  shows the ONFI protocol for the Mult iplane Cache Program operation. For both \naddresses issued in this protocol, the block address bits mu st be the same except for the bit(s) that select the \nplane.\nThe user can check operation status by  R/B# pin or Read Status Register commands (70h or 78h). If the user \nopts for 70h, Read Status Register will provide “global ” information about the operation in the two planes.\n\uf06eI/O6 indicates when both cache registers are ready to accept new data.\n\uf06eI/O5 indicates when the cell programming of  the current data registers is complete.\n\uf06eI/O1 identifies if the previous pages in both planes  (pages N-1) have been successfully programmed or not. \nThis status bit is valid upon I/O6 status bit changing to 1.\n\uf06eI/O0 identifies if any error has been detected by the program/erase controller while programming the two \npages N. This status bit is valid upon I/O5 status bit changing to 1.\nSee Table 3.5 on page 29  for more details.\nIf the system monitors the progress of the operation only wit h R/B#, the last pages of the target program \nsequence must be programmed with Page Progra m Confirm command (10h). If the Cache Program \ncommand (15h) is used instead, the status bit I/O5 mu st be polled to find out if the last programming is \nfinished before starting any other operation. Refer to Section 3.9 on page 28  for further information.\n32 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \nIf a Multiplane Cache Program operation is interrupted by hardware reset, power failure or other means, the \nhost must ensure that the interrupt ed pages are not used for further reading or programming operations until \nthe next uninterrupted block erases are complete for the applicable blocks.\n3.16 Read ID\nThe device contains a product identification mode, initia ted by writing 90h to the command register, followed \nby an address input of 00h.\nNote : If you want to execute Read Status command (0x70)  after Read ID sequence, you should input dummy \ncommand (0x00) before Read Status command (0x70).\nFor the S34ML02G1 and S34ML04G1 devices, five read cycles sequentially output the manufacturer code \n(01h), and the device code and  3rd, 4th, and 5th cycle ID, respectively . For the S34ML01G1 device, four read \ncycles sequentially output the manufacturer code (01h), device id (F1h), 3rd cycle (00h), and 4th cycle ID of \n1Dh respectively. The command register remains in Re ad ID mode until further commands are issued to it. \nFigure 6.32 on page 61  shows the operation sequence, while Table 3.6  to Table 3.11  explain the byte \nmeaning.\nTable 3.6  Read ID for Supported Configurations \nDensity Org VCC 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th\n1 Gb\nx8\n3.3V01h F1h 00h 1Dh —\n2 Gb 01h DAh 90h 95h 44h\n4 Gb 01h DCh 90h 95h 54h1 Gb\nx1601h C1h 00h 5Dh —\n2 Gb 01h CAh 90h D5h 44h\n4 Gb 01h CCh 90h D5h 54h\nTable 3.7  Read ID Bytes\nDevice Identifier Byte Description\n1st Manufacturer Code\n2nd Device Identifier3rd Internal chip number, cell type, etc.4th Page Size, Block Size, Spare Size, Serial Access Time, Organization\n5th (S34ML02G1, S34ML04G1) ECC, Multiplane information\nFebruary 10, 2014 S34ML01G1_04G1_17 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded 33Data Sheet\n \n3rd ID Data\n4th ID DataTable 3.8  Read ID Byte 3 Description\nDescription I/O7 I/O6 I/O5 I/O4 I/O3 I/O2 I/O1 I/O0\nInternal Chip Number1\n2\n480 0\n0 1\n1 01 1\nCell type2-level cell\n4-level cell8-level cell\n16-level cell0 0\n0 11 0\n1 1\nNumber of simultaneously \nprogrammed pages1\n2\n4\n80 0\n0 1\n1 0\n11\nInterleave program\nBetween multiple chipsNot supported\nSupported0\n1\nCache ProgramNot supported\nSupported0\n1\nTable 3.9  Read ID Byte 4 Description — S34ML01G1\nDescription I/O7 I/O6 I/O5 I/O4 I/O3 I/O2 I/O1 I/O0\nPage Size\n(without spare area)1 kB\n2 kB\n4 kB8 kB0 0\n0 1\n1 01 1\nBlock Size\n(without spare area)64 kB\n128 kB256 kB\n512 kB0 0\n0 11 0\n1 1\nSpare Area Size \n(byte / 512 byte)8\n160\n1\nSerial Access Time45 ns\n25 ns\nReservedReserved0\n0\n110\n1\n01\nOrganizationx8 0\nx16 1\n34 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \n5th ID Data\n3.17 Read ID2\nThe device contains an alternate identification mode,  initiated by writing 30h-65h-00h to the command \nregister, followed by address inputs, followed by  command 30h.

O” Stands for Optional, “M” for Mandatory.\n3.20 One-Time Programmable (OTP) Entry\nThe device contains a one-time programmable (OTP) ar ea, which is accessed by writing 29h-17h-04h-19h to \nthe command register. The device is then ready to accept Page Read and Page Program commands (refer to \nPage Read  and Page Program  on page 21 ). The OTP area is of a single erase block size (64 pages), and \nhence only row addresses between 00h and 3Fh are allowed. The host must issue the Reset command (refer to Reset  on page 29 ) to exit the OTP area and access the normal flash array. The Block Erase command is \nnot allowed in the OTP area. Refer to Figure 6.36 on page 63  for more detail on the OTP Entry command \nsequence.\nNote:  The OTP feature in the S34ML01G1 do es not have non-volatile protection.\n4. Signal Descriptions\n4.1 Data Protection and Power On / Off Sequence\nThe device is designed to offer protection from any in voluntary program/erase during power-transitions. An \ninternal voltage detector disables all functions whenever VCC is below about 1.8V.\nThe power-up and power-down sequence is shown in Figure 6.37 on page 63 , in this case VCC and VCCQ on \nthe one hand (and VSS and VSSQ on the other hand) are shor ted together at all times.\nThe Ready/Busy signal shall be valid within 100 µs after the power supplies have reached the minimum \nvalues (as specified on), and shall return to one within 5 ms (max).\nDuring this busy time, the device executes the initialization process (cam reading), and dissipates a current \nICC0 (30 mA max), in addition, it disregards all commands excluding Read Status Register (70h).\nAt the end of this busy time, the device defaults into “read setup”, thus if the user decides to issue a page \nread command, the 00h command may be skipped.\nThe WP# pin provides hardware protection  and is recommended to be kept at VIL during power-up and \npower-down. A recovery time of minimum 100 µs is required before the internal circuit gets ready for any \ncommand sequences as shown in Figure 6.37 on page 63 . The two-step command sequence for \nprogram/erase provides additional software protection.164-165 M Vendor specific Revision number 00h \n166-253 Vendor specific 00h \n254-255 M Integrity CRC S34ML01G100 (x8): FFh, 63h\nS34ML02G100 (x8): 3Bh, C5h\nS34ML04G100 (x8): 45h, 8Eh\nS34ML01G104 (x16) : 8Dh, 15h\nS34ML02G104 (x16) : 49h, B3h\nS34ML04G104 (x16) : 37h, F8h\nRedundant Parameter Pages\n256-511 M Value of bytes 0-255 Repeat Value of bytes 0-255 \n512-767 M Value of bytes 0-255 Repeat Value of bytes 0-255 \n768+ O Additional redundant parameter pages FFh Table 3.12  Parameter Page Description  (Sheet 3 of 3)\nByte O/M Description Values \n38 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \n4.2 Ready/Busy\nThe Ready/Busy output provides a method of indicating  the completion of a page program, erase, copyback, \nor read completion. The R/B# pin is normally high and goes to low when the device is busy (after a reset, \nread, program, or erase operat ion). It returns to high when the internal controller has finished the operation. \nThe pin is an open-drain driver thereby allowing two or more R/B# outputs to be Or-tied. Because the pull-up \nresistor value is related to tr (R/B#) and the current drain during busy (ibusy), and output load capacitance is \nrelated to tf an appropriate value can be obtained with the reference chart shown in Figure 4.1 .\nFor example, for a par ticular system with 20 pF of output load, tf from VCC to VOL at 10% to 90% will be 10 ns, \nwhereas for a particular load of 50 pF, Spansion measured it to be 20 ns as shown in Figure 4.1 .\nFigure 4.1  Ready/Busy Pin Electrical Application \n Rp v s. tr, tf and Rp v s. ibusyRpibusy\nBusyReady VCC\nVOH\nVOLVOL : 0.4V,  VOH : 2.4VVcc\nGND\nDeviceopen dr ain outputR/B#\nCL\n300n\n200n\n100n= tf (ns)\n20 20 20 2050= tr (ns)3m\n2m\n1mibusy [A]\ntr,tf [s]\n1k 2k 3k4 k= ibusy (mA)\n1.22.4\n100150200\n0.8\n0.6\nRp (ohm)@ Vcc = 3.3V, Ta = 25°C, C L=50 pF\nRp v alue guidence\nRp (min.) = =Vcc (M ax.) - V OL (Max.) 3.2V\n8mA + ∑I L IOL +  IL∑\nRp(m ax) is determined by maximum permi ssible limit of tr.where      i s the sum of the inp ut current s of all device s tied to the R/B# pin.

Switching WP# low during this time is equivalent to issuing a Reset command (FFh). The contents of \nmemory cells being altered are no longer valid, as the data will be partially programmed or erased. The \nR/B# pin will stay low for tRST (similarly to Figure 6.24 on page 55 ). At the end of this time, the command \nregister is ready to process the next command, and the Status Register bit I/ O6 will be cleared to 1, while I/O7 \nvalue will be related to the WP# value. Refer to Table 3.5 on page 29  for more information on device status.\nErase and program operations are enabled or disabled by  setting WP# to high or low respectively, prior to \nissuing the setup commands (80h or 60h). The level of WP# shall be set tWW ns prior to raising the WE# pin \nfor the set up command, as explained in Figure 6.38  and Figure 6.39 on page 64 .\nFigure 4.2  WP# Low Timing Requirements during Program/Erase Command Sequence\nWE#\nI/O[7:0]\nWP#Valid\n> 100 n sSequence\nAborted\n40 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \n5.

The time to Ready depends on the value of the pull-up resistor tied to R/B# pin. \n2. If Reset Command (FFh) is written at Ready state, the device goes into Busy for maximum 5 µs.\n3. CE# low to high or RE# low to high can be at different times and produce three cases. Depending on which signal comes high fi rst, either \ntCOH or tRHOH  will be met.\n4. During data output, tCEA depends partly on tCR (CE# low to RE# low). If tCR exceeds the minimum value specified, then the maximum \ntime for tCEA may also be exceeded (tCEA = tCR + tREA).Table 5.4  AC Characteristics\nParameter Symbol Min Max Unit\nALE to RE# delay tAR 10 — ns\nALE hold time tALH 5— n s\nALE setup time tALS 10 — ns\nAddress to data loading time tADL 70 — ns\nCE# low to RE# low tCR 10 — ns\nCE# hold time tCH 5— n s\nCE# high to output High-Z tCHZ —3 0 n s\nCLE hold time tCLH 5— n s\nCLE to RE# delay tCLR 10 — ns\nCLE setup time tCLS 10 — ns\nCE# access time tCEA (4) —2 5 n s\nCE# high to output hold tCOH (3) 15 — ns\nCE# high to ALE or CLE don\'t care tCSD 10 — ns\nCE# setup time tCS 20 — ns\nData hold time tDH 5— n s\nData setup time tDS 10 — ns\nData transfer from cell to register tR —2 5 µ s\nOutput High-Z to RE# low tIR 0— n s\nRead cycle time tRC 25 — ns\nRE# access time tREA —2 0 n s\nRE# high hold time tREH 10 — ns\nRE# high to output hold tRHOH (3) 15 — ns\nRE# high to WE# low tRHW 100 — ns\nRE# high to output High-Z tRHZ — 100 ns\nRE# low to output hold tRLOH 5— n s\nRE# pulse width tRP 12 — ns\nReady to RE# low tRR 20 — ns\nDevice resetting time (Read/Program/Erase) tRST — 5/10/500 µs\nWE# high to busy tWB — 100 ns\nWrite cycle time tWC 25 — ns\nWE# high hold time tWH 10 — ns\nWE# high to RE# low tWHR 60 — ns\nWE# pulse width tWP 12 — ns\nWrite protect time tWW 100 — ns\n42 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \n5.5 DC Characteristics \nNotes:\n1.

Error Management\n9.1 System Bad Block Replacement\nOver the lifetime of the device, additional Bad Blocks may develop. In this case, each bad block has to be \nreplaced by copying any valid data to a new block. These additional Bad Blocks can be identified whenever a \nprogram or erase operation reports “Fail” in the Status Register.\nThe failure of a page program operation does not affect t he data in other pages in the same block, thus the \nblock can be replaced by re-programming the current da ta and copying the rest of the replaced block to an \navailable valid block. Refer to Table 9.1  and Figure 9.1  for the recommended procedure to follow if an error \noccurs during an operation.\nFigure 9.1  Bad Block Replacement\nNotes:\n1. An error occurs on the Nth page of Block A during a program operation.\n2. Data in Block A is copied to the same location in Block B, which is a valid block.\n3. The Nth page of block A, which is in controller buffer memory, is copied into the Nth page of Block B.\n4. Bad block table should be updated to prevent from erasing or programming Block A.Table 9.1  Block Failure\nOperation Recommended Procedure\nErase Block Replacement\nProgram Block Replacement\nRead ECC (1 bit / 512+16 byte)\nData\nbuffer memory of the controllerN   p age\nFFhData\nFFhFailurethN   p agethBlock A Block B\n(1)(2)\n(3)\n70 Spansion®  SLC NAND Flash Memory for Embedded S34ML01G1_04G1_17 February 10, 2014Data Sheet\n \n9.2 Bad Block Management\nDevices with Bad Blocks have the same quality level and the same AC  and DC characteristics as devices \nwhere all the blocks are valid. A B ad Block does not affect the performa nce of valid blocks because it is \nisolated from the bit line and common source line by a se lect transistor. The devices are supplied with all the \nlocations inside valid blocks erased (F Fh). The Bad Block Information is wr itten prior to sh ipping. Any block \nwhere the 1st byte in the spare area of the 1st or 2nd or last page does not contain FFh is a Bad Block. That \nis, if the first page has an FF value and should have been a non-FF value, then the non-FF value in the \nsecond page or the last page will indicate a bad block.The Bad Block Information must be read before any \nerase is attempted, as t he Bad Block Information may be erased. For the system to be able to recognize the \nBad Blocks based on the original in formation, it is recommended to cr eate a Bad Block table following the \nflowchart shown in Figure 9.2 . The host is responsible to detect and track bad blocks, both factory bad blocks \nand blocks that may go bad duri ng operation. Once a block is found to be bad,  data should no t be written to \nthat block.The 1st block, which is placed on 00h block address is guaranteed to be a valid block.\nFigure 9.2  Bad Block Management Flowchart\nNote:\n1.
