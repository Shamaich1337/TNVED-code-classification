It is internally configured as a quad-bank DRAM with a synchronous in-terface (all signals are registered on the positive edge of the clock signal, CLK). Each ofthe x4’s 67,108,864-bit banks is organized as 8192 rows by 2048 columns by 4 bits. Eachof the 16,777,216-bit banks is organized as 2048 rows by 256 columns by 32 bits.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nImportant Notes and Warnings\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev. V 09/14 EN 7Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n\x8b 1999 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nRead and write accesses to the SDRAM are burst-oriented; accesses start at a selected\nlocation and continue for a programmed number of locations in a programmed se-quence. Accesses begin with the registration of an ACTIVE command, which is then fol-lowed by a READ or WRITE command. The address bits registered coincident with theACTIVE command are used to select the bank and row to be accessed (BA[1:0] select thebank; A[10:0] select the row). The address bits registered coincident with the READ orWRITE command are used to select the starting column location for the burst access.\nThe SDRAM provides for programmable read or write burst lengths (BL) of 1, 2, 4, or 8\nlocations, or the full page, with a burst terminate option. An auto precharge functionmay be enabled to provide a self-timed row precharge that is initiated at the end of theburst sequence.\nThe 64Mb SDRAM uses an internal pipelined architecture to achieve high-speed opera-\ntion. This architecture is compatible with the 2 n rule of prefetch architectures, but it al-\nso allows the column address to be changed on every clock cycle to achieve a high-speed, fully random access. Precharging one bank while accessing one of the otherthree banks will hide the PRECHARGE cycles and provide seamless, high-speed, ran-dom-access operation.\nThe 64Mb SDRAM is designed to operate in 3.3V memory systems. An auto refresh\nmode is provided, along with a power-saving, power-down mode. All inputs and out-puts are LVTTL-compatible.\nSDRAM devices offer substantial advances in DRAM operating performance, including\nthe ability to synchronously burst data at a high data rate with automatic column-ad-dress generation, the ability to interleave between internal banks to hide precharge\ntime, and the capability to randomly change column addresses on each clock cycle dur-ing a burst access.\nAutomotive Temperature\nThe automotive temperature (AT) option adheres to the following specifications:\n• 16ms refresh rate\n• Self refresh not supported• Ambient and case temperature cannot be less than –40°C or greater than +105°C64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nGeneral Description\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

All SDRAM input signals are sampled on the positive\nedge of CLK. CLK also increments the internal burst counter and controls the output registers.\nCKE Input Clock enable:  CKE activates (HIGH) and deactivates (LOW) the CLK signal. Deactivating the\nclock provides precharge power-down and SELF REFRESH operation (all banks idle), activepower-down (row active in any bank), or CLOCK SUSPEND operation (burst/access in pro-gress). CKE is synchronous except after the device enters power-down and self refresh modes,where CKE becomes asynchronous until after exiting the same mode. The input buffers, in-cluding CLK, are disabled during power-down and self refresh modes, providing low standbypower. CKE may be tied HIGH.\nCS# Input Chip select:  CS# enables (registered LOW) and disables (registered HIGH) the command de-\ncoder. All commands are masked when CS# is registered HIGH, but READ/WRITE bursts alreadyin progress will continue, and DQM operation will retain its DQ mask capability while CS# isHIGH. CS# provides for external bank selection on systems with multiple banks. CS# is consid-ered part of the command code.\nCAS#, RAS#,\nWE#Input Command inputs:  RAS#, CAS#, and WE# (along with CS#) define the command being en-\ntered.\nDQM[3:0] Input Input/output mask:  DQM is sampled HIGH and is an input mask signal for write accesses and\nan output enable signal for read accesses. Input data is masked during a WRITE cycle. Theoutput buffers are placed in a High-Z state (two-clock latency) during a READ cycle. DQM0corresponds to DQ[7:0]; DQM1 corresponds to DQ[15:8]; DQM2 corresponds to DQ[23:16]; andDQM3 corresponds to DQ[31:24]. DQM[3:0] are considered same state when referenced asDQM.\nBA[1:0] Input Bank address input(s):  BA[1:0] define to which bank the ACTIVE, READ, WRITE, or PRE-\nCHARGE command is being applied.\nA[10:0] Input Address inputs:  A[10:0] are sampled during the ACTIVE command (row address A[10:0]) and\nREAD or WRITE command (column address A[7:0] with A10 defining auto precharge) to selectone location out of the memory array in the respective bank. A10 is sampled during a PRE-CHARGE command to determine if all banks are to be precharged (A10 HIGH) or bank selec-ted by BA[1:0] (LOW).

An important step in maintaining theproper junction temperature is using the device’s thermal impedances correctly. Thethermal impedances are listed in Table 6 (page 16) for the applicable die revision andpackages being made available. These thermal impedance values vary according to thedensity, package, and particular design used for each device.\nIncorrectly using thermal impedances can produce significant errors. Read Micron\ntechnical note TN-00-08, “Thermal Applications” prior to using the thermal impedan-ces listed in Table 6 (page 16). To ensure the compatibility of current and future de-signs, contact Micron Applications Engineering to confirm thermal impedance values.\nThe SDRAM device’s safe junction temperature range can be maintained when the T\nC\nspecification is not exceeded. In applications where the device’s ambient temperature\nis too high, use of forced air and/or heat sinks may be required to satisfy the case tem-perature specifications.\nTable 5: Temperature Limits\nParameter Symbol Min Max Unit Notes\nOperating case temperature Commercial T C 0 80 °C 1, 2, 3, 4\nIndustrial –40 90Automotive –40 105\nJunction temperature Commercial T\nJ 08 5 ° C3\nIndustrial –40 95Automotive –40 110\nAmbient temperature Commercial T\nA 0 70 °C 3, 5\nIndustrial –40 85Automotive –40 105\nPeak reflow temperature T\nPEAK – 260 °C  \nNotes: 1. MAX operating case temperature T C is measured in the center of the package on the\ntop side of the device, as shown in Figure 6 (page 16) and Figure 7 (page 17).\n2. Device functionality is not guaranteed if the device exceeds maximum T C during opera-\ntion.\n3. All temperature specifications must be satisfied.4. The case temperature should be measured by gluing a thermocouple to the top-center\nof the component. This should be done with a 1mm bead of conductive epoxy, as de-fined by the JEDEC EIA/JESD51 standards. Take care to ensure that the thermocouplebead is touching the case.\n5.

All rights reserved.\nFunctional Description\nIn general, this 64Mb SDRAM device (512K x 32x 4 banks) is a quad-bank DRAM that\noperates at 3.3V and include a synchronous interface. All signals are registered on thepositive edge of the clock signal, CLK. Each of the 16,777,216-bit banks is organized as2048 rows by 256 columns by 32 bits.\nRead and write accesses to the SDRAM are burst-oriented; accesses start at a selected\nlocation and continue for a programmed number of locations in a programmed se-quence. Accesses begin with the registration of an ACTIVE command, followed by aREAD or WRITE command. The address bits registered coincident with the ACTIVEcommand are used to select the bank and row to be accessed (BA0 and BA1 select thebank, A[10:0] select the row). The address bits (A[7:0]) registered coincident with theREAD or WRITE command are used to select the starting column location for the burstaccess.\nPrior to normal operation, the device must be initialized. The following sections provide\ndetailed information covering device initialization, register definition, command de-scriptions, and device operation.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nFunctional Description\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

Additional Truth Tables (Table 15 (page 32), Ta-ble 16 (page 34), and Table 17 (page 36)) provide current state/next state informa-tion.\nTable 14: Truth Table – Commands and DQM Operation\nNote 1 applies to all parameters and conditions\nName (Function) CS# RAS# CAS# WE# DQM ADDR DQ Notes\nCOMMAND INHIBIT (NOP) H X X X X X X  NO OPERATION (NOP) L H H H X X X  ACTIVE (select bank and activate row) L L H H X Bank/row X 2READ (select bank and column, and start READ burst) L H L H L/H Bank/col X 3WRITE (select bank and column, and start WRITE burst) L H L L L/H Bank/col Valid 3BURST TERMINATE L H H L X X Active 4PRECHARGE (Deactivate row in bank or banks) L L H L X Code X 5AUTO REFRESH or SELF REFRESH (enter self refresh mode) L L L H X X X 6, 7LOAD MODE REGISTER L L L L X Op-code X 8Write enable/output enable X X X X L X Active 9Write inhibit/output High-Z X X X X H X High-Z 9\nNotes: 1. CKE is HIGH for all commands shown except SELF REFRESH.\n2. A[0 :n] provide row address (where A n is the most significant address bit), BA0 and BA1\ndetermine which bank is made active.\n3. A[0 :i] provide column address (where i = the most significant column address for a given\ndevice configuration). A10 HIGH enables the auto precharge feature (nonpersistent),while A10 LOW disables the auto precharge feature. BA0 and BA1 determine whichbank is being read from or written to.\n4. The purpose of the BURST TERMINATE command is to stop a data burst, thus the com-\nmand could coincide with data on the bus. However, the DQ column reads a “Don’tCare” state to illustrate that the BURST TERMINATE command can occur when there isno data present.\n5. A10 LOW: BA0, BA1 determine the bank being precharged. A10 HIGH: all banks pre-\ncharged and BA0, BA1 are “Don’t Care.”\n6. This command is AUTO REFRESH if CKE is HIGH, SELF REFRESH if CKE is LOW.7. Internal refresh counter controls row addressing; all inputs and I/Os are “Don’t Care” ex-\ncept for CKE.\n8. A[11:0] define the op-code written to the mode register.9. Activates or deactivates the DQ during WRITEs (zero-clock delay) and READs (two-clock\ndelay).\nCOMMAND INHIBIT\nThe COMMAND INHIBIT function prevents new commands from being executed by\nthe device, regardless of whether the CLK signal is enabled. The device is effectively de-selected. Operations already in progress are not affected.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nNO OPERATION (NOP)\nThe NO OPERATION (NOP) command is used to perform a NOP to the selected device\n(CS# is LOW). This prevents unwanted commands from being registered during idle orwait states. Operations already in progress are not affected.\nLOAD MODE REGISTER (LMR)\nThe mode registers are loaded via inputs A[ n:0]  (where A n is the most significant ad-\ndress term), BA0, and BA1(see Mode Register (page 39)). The LOAD MODE REGISTERcommand can only be issued when all banks are idle and a subsequent executable com-mand cannot be issued until \ntMRD is met.\nACTIVE\nThe ACTIVE command is used to activate a row in a particular bank for a subsequentaccess. The value on the BA0, BA1 inputs selects the bank, and the address provided se-lects the row. This row remains active for accesses until a PRECHARGE command is is-sued to that bank. A PRECHARGE command must be issued before opening a differentrow in the same bank.\nFigure 8: ACTIVE Command\nCS#\nWE#CAS#RAS#CKECLK\nAddress Row address\nDon’t CareHIGH\nBA0, BA1 Bank address64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

The values\non the BA0 and BA1 inputs select the bank; the address provided selects the starting col-umn location. The value on input A10 determines whether auto precharge is used. If au-to precharge is selected, the row being accessed is precharged at the end of the READburst; if auto precharge is not selected, the row remains open for subsequent accesses.Read data appears on the DQ subject to the logic level on the DQM inputs two clocksearlier.

The values\non the BA0 and BA1 inputs select the bank; the address provided selects the starting col-umn location. The value on input A10 determines whether auto precharge is used. If au-to precharge is selected, the row being accessed is precharged at the end of the writeburst; if auto precharge is not selected, the row remains open for subsequent accesses.Input data appearing on the DQ is written to the memory array, subject to the DQM in-put logic level appearing coincident with the data.

All rights reserved.\nPRECHARGE\nThe PRECHARGE command is used to deactivate the open row in a particular bank or\nthe open row in all banks. The bank(s) will be available for a subsequent row access aspecified time (\ntRP) after the PRECHARGE command is issued. Input A10 determines\nwhether one or all banks are to be precharged, and in the case where only one bank isprecharged, inputs BA0 and BA1 select the bank. Otherwise BA0 and BA1 are treated as“Don’t Care.” After a bank has been precharged, it is in the idle state and must be acti-vated prior to any READ or WRITE commands are issued to that bank.\nFigure 11: PRECHARGE Command\nCS#\nWE#CAS#RAS#CKECLK\nA10\nDon’t CareHIGH\nAll banks\nBank selectedAddress\nBA0, BA1 Bank address\nValid address\nBURST TERMINATE\nThe BURST TERMINATE command is used to truncate either fixed-length or continu-\nous page bursts.

All rights reserved.\nREFRESH\nAUTO REFRESH\nAUTO REFRESH is used during normal operation of the SDRAM and is analogous to\nCAS#-BEFORE-RAS# (CBR) refresh in conventional DRAMs. This command is nonper-sistent, so it must be issued each time a refresh is required. All active banks must be pre-charged prior to issuing an AUTO REFRESH command. The AUTO REFRESH commandshould not be issued until the minimum \ntRP has been met after the PRECHARGE com-\nmand, as shown in Bank/Row Activation (page 44).\nThe addressing is generated by the internal refresh controller. This makes the address\nbits a “Don’t Care” during an AUTO REFRESH command. Regardless of device width,the 64Mb SDRAM requires 4096 AUTO REFRESH cycles every 64ms (commercial andindustrial) or 16ms (automotive). Providing a distributed AUTO REFRESH commandevery 15.625 ˩s (commercial and industrial) or 3.906 ˩s (automotive) will meet the re-\nfresh requirement and ensure that each row is refreshed. Alternatively, 4096 AUTO RE-FRESH commands can be issued in a burst at the minimum cycle rate (\ntRFC), once ev-\nery 64ms (commercial and industrial) or 16ms (automotive).\nSELF REFRESH\nThe SELF REFRESH command can be used to retain data in the SDRAM, even if the rest\nof the system is powered-down. When in the self refresh mode, the SDRAM retains datawithout external clocking.\nThe SELF REFRESH command is initiated like an AUTO REFRESH command except\nCKE is disabled (LOW). After the SELF REFRESH command is registered, all the inputsto the SDRAM become a “Don’t Care” with the exception of CKE, which must remainLOW.\nAfter self refresh mode is engaged, the SDRAM provides its own internal clocking, caus-\ning it to perform its own AUTO REFRESH cycles. The SDRAM must remain in self re-fresh mode for a minimum period equal to \ntRAS and may remain in self refresh mode\nfor an indefinite period beyond that.\nThe procedure for exiting self refresh requires a sequence of commands. First, CLK\nmust be stable (stable clock is defined as a signal cycling within timing constraintsspecified for the clock pin) prior to CKE going back HIGH. After CKE is HIGH, theSDRAM must have NOP commands issued (a minimum of two clocks) for \ntXSR because\ntime is required for the completion of any internal refresh in progress.\nUpon exiting the self refresh mode, AUTO REFRESH commands must be issued at the\nspecified intervals, as both SELF REFRESH and AUTO REFRESH utilize the row refreshcounter.\nSelf refresh is not supported on automotive temperature devices.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nCommands\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

After power is ap-plied to V\nDD and V DDQ  (simultaneously) and the clock is stable (stable clock is defined\nas a signal cycling within timing constraints specified for the clock pin), the SDRAM re-quires a 100 ˩s delay prior to issuing any command other than a COMMAND INHIBIT or\nNOP . Starting at some point during this 100 ˩s period and continuing at least through\nthe end of this period, COMMAND INHIBIT or NOP commands must be applied.\nAfter the 100 ˩s delay has been satisfied with at least one COMMAND INHIBIT or NOP\ncommand having been applied, a PRECHARGE command should be applied. All banksmust then be precharged, thereby placing the device in the all banks idle state.\nOnce in the idle state, at least two AUTO REFRESH cycles must be performed. After the\nAUTO REFRESH cycles are complete, the SDRAM is ready for mode register program-ming. Because the mode register will power up in an unknown state, it must be loadedprior to applying any operational command. If desired, the two AUTO REFRESH com-mands can be issued after the LMR command.\nThe recommended power-up sequence for SDRAM:\n1. Simultaneously apply power to V\nDD and V DDQ .\n2. Assert and hold CKE at a LVTTL logic LOW since all inputs and outputs are LVTTL-\ncompatible.\n3. Provide stable CLOCK signal. Stable clock is defined as a signal cycling within tim-\ning constraints specified for the clock pin.\n4. Wait at least 100 ˩s prior to issuing any command other than a COMMAND INHIB-\nIT or NOP .\n5. Starting at some point during this 100 ˩s period, bring CKE HIGH. Continuing at\nleast through the end of this period, 1 or more COMMAND INHIBIT or NOP com-mands must be applied.\n6. Perform a PRECHARGE ALL command.7. Wait at least \ntRP time; during this time NOPs or DESELECT commands must be\ngiven. All banks will complete their precharge, thereby placing the device in the allbanks idle state.\n8. Issue an AUTO REFRESH command.9. Wait at least \ntRFC time, during which only NOPs or COMMAND INHIBIT com-\nmands are allowed.\n10. Issue an AUTO REFRESH command.11. Wait at least \ntRFC time, during which only NOPs or COMMAND INHIBIT com-\nmands are allowed.\n12. The SDRAM is now ready for mode register programming. Because the mode reg-\nister will power up in an unknown state, it should be loaded with desired bit valuesprior to applying any operational command. Using the LMR command, programthe mode register. The mode register is programmed via the MODE REGISTER SETcommand with BA1 = 0, BA0 = 0 and retains the stored information until it is pro-grammed again or the device loses power. Not programming the mode registerupon initialization will result in default settings which may not be desired. Out-puts are guaranteed High-Z after the LMR command is issued.

The mode registeris programmed via the LOAD MODE REGISTER command and retains the stored infor-mation until it is programmed again or the device loses power.\nMode register bits M[2:0] specify the BL; M3 specifies the type of burst; M[6:4] specify\nthe CL; M7 and M8 specify the operating mode; M9 specifies the write burst mode; andM10–M n should be set to zero to ensure compatibility with future revisions. M n + 1 and\nMn + 2 should be set to zero to select the mode register.\nThe mode registers must be loaded when all banks are idle, and the controller must wait\ntMRD before initiating the subsequent operation. Violating either of these requirements\nwill result in unspecified operation.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nMode Register\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

The burst length determines the maximum number of column loca-tions that can be accessed for a given READ or WRITE command. Burst lengths of 1, 2,4, 8, or continuous locations are available for both the sequential and the interleavedburst types, and a continuous page burst is available for the sequential type. The con-tinuous page burst is used in conjunction with the BURST TERMINATE command togenerate arbitrary burst lengths.\nReserved states should not be used, as unknown operation or incompatibility with fu-\nture versions may result.\nWhen a READ or WRITE command is issued, a block of columns equal to the burst\nlength is effectively selected. All accesses for that burst take place within this block,meaning that the burst wraps within the block when a boundary is reached. The blockis uniquely selected by A[8:1] when BL = 2, A[8:2] when BL = 4, and A[8:3] when BL = 8.The remaining (least significant) address bit(s) is (are) used to select the starting loca-tion within the block. Continuous page bursts wrap within the page when the boundaryis reached.\nBurst Type\nAccesses within a given burst can be programmed to be either sequential or interleaved;this is referred to as the burst type and is selected via bit M3.\nThe ordering of accesses within a burst is determined by the burst length, the burst\ntype, and the starting column address.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nMode Register\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

The latency can be set to two or threeclocks.\nIf a READ command is registered at clock edge n, and the latency is m clocks, the data\nwill be available by clock edge n + m . The DQ start driving as a result of the clock edge\none cycle earlier ( n + m  - 1), and provided that the relevant access times are met, the\ndata is valid by clock edge n + m . For example, assuming that the clock cycle time is\nsuch that all relevant access times are met, if a READ command is registered at T0 andthe latency is programmed to two clocks, the DQ start driving after T1 and the data isvalid by T2.\nReserved states should not be used as unknown operation or incompatibility with fu-\nture versions may result.\nFigure 14: CAS Latency\nCLK\nDQT2 T1 T3 T0\nCL = 3 tLZ\nDOUTtOHCommand NOP READ NOPT4\nNOP\nDon’t Care UndefinedCLK\nDQT2 T1 T3 T0\nCL = 2 tLZ\nDOUTtOHCommand NOP READ\ntAC\ntACNOP\nOperating Mode\nThe normal operating mode is selected by setting M7 and M8 to zero; the other combi-\nnations of values for M7 and M8 are reserved for future use.

All rights reserved.\nBank/Row Activation\nBefore any READ or WRITE commands can be issued to a bank within the SDRAM, a\nrow in that bank must be opened. This is accomplished via the ACTIVE command,which selects both the bank and the row to be activated.\nAfter a row is opened with the ACTIVE command, a READ or WRITE command can be\nissued to that row, subject to the \ntRCD specification. tRCD (MIN) should be divided by\nthe clock period and rounded up to the next whole number to determine the earliestclock edge after the ACTIVE command on which a READ or WRITE command can beentered. For example, a \ntRCD specification of 20ns with a 125 MHz clock (8ns period)\nresults in 2.5 clocks, rounded to 3. This is reflected in Figure 15 (page 44), which coversany case where 2 < \ntRCD (MIN)/tCK ื 3. (The same procedure is used to convert other\nspecification limits from time units to clock cycles.)\nA subsequent ACTIVE command to a different row in the same bank can only be issued\nafter the previous active row has been precharged. The minimum time interval betweensuccessive ACTIVE commands to the same bank is defined by \ntRC.\nA subsequent ACTIVE command to another bank can be issued while the first bank is\nbeing accessed, which results in a reduction of total row-access overhead. The mini-mum time interval between successive ACTIVE commands to different banks is definedby \ntRRD.\nFigure 15: Example: Meeting tRCD (MIN) When 2 < tRCD (MIN)/tCK < 3\n \nCLKT2 T1 T3 T0\ntCommand NOP ACTIVEREAD or \nWRITENOP\nRCD(MIN)tCKtCKtCK\nDon’t Care64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nBank/Row Activation\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nREAD Operation\nREAD bursts are initiated with a READ command, as shown in Figure 9 (page 28). The\nstarting column and bank addresses are provided with the READ command, and autoprecharge is either enabled or disabled for that burst access. If auto precharge is ena-bled, the row being accessed is precharged at the completion of the burst. In the follow-ing figures, auto precharge is disabled.\nDuring READ bursts, the valid data-out element from the starting column address is\navailable following the CAS latency after the READ command. Each subsequent data-out element will be valid by the next positive clock edge. Figure 17 (page 47) showsgeneral timing for each possible CAS latency setting.\nUpon completion of a burst, assuming no other commands have been initiated, the DQ\nsignals will go to High-Z. A continuous page burst continues until terminated. At theend of the page, it wraps to column 0 and continues.\nData from any READ burst can be truncated with a subsequent READ command, and\ndata from a fixed-length READ burst can be followed immediately by data from a READcommand. In either case, a continuous flow of data can be maintained. The first dataelement from the new burst either follows the last element of a completed burst or thelast desired data element of a longer burst that is being truncated. The new READ com-mand should be issued x cycles before the clock edge at which the last desired data ele-\nment is valid, where  x = CL - 1. This is shown in Figure 17 (page 47) for CL2 and CL3.\nSDRAM devices use a pipelined architecture and therefore do not require the 2 n rule as-\nsociated with a prefetch architecture. A READ command can be initiated on any clockcycle following a READ command. Full-speed random read accesses can be performedto the same bank, or each subsequent READ can be performed to a different bank.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nREAD Operation\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

Each READ command can be issued to any bank. DQM is LOW.\nData from any READ burst can be truncated with a subsequent WRITE command, and\ndata from a fixed-length READ burst can be followed immediately by data from aWRITE command (subject to bus turnaround limitations). The WRITE burst can be ini-tiated on the clock edge immediately following the last (or last desired) data elementfrom the READ burst, provided that I/O contention can be avoided. In a given systemdesign, there is a possibility that the device driving the input data will go Low-Z beforethe DQ go High-Z. In this case, at least a single-cycle delay should occur between thelast read data and the WRITE command.\nThe DQM input is used to avoid I/O contention, as shown in Figure 18 (page 48) and\nFigure 19 (page 49). The DQM signal must be asserted (HIGH) at least two clocks priorto the WRITE command (DQM latency is two clocks for output buffers) to suppress da-ta-out from the READ. After the WRITE command is registered, the DQ will go to High-Z(or remain High-Z), regardless of the state of the DQM signal, provided the DQM wasactive on the clock just prior to the WRITE command that truncated the READ com-mand. If not, the second WRITE will be an invalid WRITE. For example, if DQM wasLOW during T4, then the WRITEs at T5 and T7 would be valid, and the WRITE at T6would be invalid.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nREAD Operation\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nThe DQM signal must be de-asserted prior to the WRITE command (DQM latency is\nzero clocks for input buffers) to ensure that the written data is not masked. Figure 18(page 48) shows where, due to the clock cycle frequency, bus contention is avoidedwithout having to add a NOP cycle, while Figure 19 (page 49) shows the case where anadditional NOP cycle is required.\nA fixed-length READ burst may be followed by or truncated with a PRECHARGE com-\nmand to the same bank, provided that auto precharge was not activated. The PRE-CHARGE command should be issued x cycles before the clock edge at which the last de-\nsired data element is valid, where x = CL - 1. This is shown in Figure 20 (page 49) for\neach possible CL; data element n + 3 is either the last of a burst of four or the last de-\nsired data element of a longer burst. Following the PRECHARGE command, a subse-quent command to the same bank cannot be issued until \ntRP is met. Note that part of\nthe row precharge time is hidden during the access of the last data element(s).\nIn the case of a fixed-length burst being executed to completion, a PRECHARGE com-\nmand issued at the optimum time (as described above) provides the same operationthat would result from the same fixed-length burst with auto precharge. The disadvant-age of the PRECHARGE command is that it requires that the command and addressbuses be available at the appropriate time to issue the command. The advantage of thePRECHARGE command is that it can be used to truncate fixed-length or continuouspage bursts.\nFigure 18: READ-to-WRITE\nREAD NOP NOP WRITE NOPCLKT2 T1 T4 T3 T0\nDQM\nDQCommand\n  Address Bank,\nCol b Bank,\nCol n\nDStHZtCK\nDon’t Care Transitioning datatDOUTDIN\nNote: 1.

For the ge-neric WRITE commands used in the following figures, auto precharge is disabled.\nDuring WRITE bursts, the first valid data-in element is registered coincident with the\nWRITE command. Subsequent data elements are registered on each successive positiveclock edge. Upon completion of a fixed-length burst, assuming no other commandshave been initiated, the DQ will remain at High-Z and any additional input data will beignored (see Figure 25 (page 54)). A continuous page burst continues until terminated;at the end of the page, it wraps to column 0 and continues.\nData for any WRITE burst can be truncated with a subsequent WRITE command, and\ndata for a fixed-length WRITE burst can be followed immediately by data for a WRITEcommand. The new WRITE command can be issued on any clock following the previ-ous WRITE command, and the data provided coincident with the new command ap-plies to the new command (see Figure 26 (page 55)). Data n + 1 is either the last of a\nburst of two or the last desired data element of a longer burst.\nSDRAM devices use a pipelined architecture and therefore do not require the 2 n rule as-\nsociated with a prefetch architecture. A WRITE command can be initiated on any clockcycle following a previous WRITE command. Full-speed random write accesses within apage can be performed to the same bank, as shown in Figure 27 (page 56), or eachsubsequent WRITE can be performed to a different bank.\nFigure 25: WRITE Burst\nCLK\nDQDINT2 T1 T3 T0\nCommand\nAddressNOP NOP\nDon’t CareWRITE\nDINNOP\nBank,\nCol n\nTransitioning data\nNote: 1.

Data n + 1 is either the last of a burst of two or the\nlast desired data element of a longer burst.\nData for a fixed-length WRITE burst can be followed by or truncated with a PRE-\nCHARGE command to the same bank, provided that auto precharge was not activated.A continuous-page WRITE burst can be truncated with a PRECHARGE command to thesame bank. The PRECHARGE command should be issued \ntWR after the clock edge at\nwhich the last desired input data element is registered. The auto precharge mode re-quires a \ntWR of at least one clock with time to complete, regardless of frequency.\nIn addition, when truncating a WRITE burst at high clock frequencies (tCK < 15ns), the\nDQM signal must be used to mask input data for the clock edge prior to and the clockedge coincident with the PRECHARGE command (see Figure 29 (page 57)). Data n + 1\nis either the last of a burst of two or the last desired data element of a longer burst. Fol-lowing the PRECHARGE command, a subsequent command to the same bank cannotbe issued until \ntRP is met.\nIn the case of a fixed-length burst being executed to completion, a PRECHARGE com-\nmand issued at the optimum time (as described above) provides the same operationthat would result from the same fixed-length burst with auto precharge. The disadvant-age of the PRECHARGE command is that it requires that the command and addressbuses be available at the appropriate time to issue the command. The advantage of thePRECHARGE command is that it can be used to truncate fixed-length bursts or continu-ous page bursts.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nWRITE Operation\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nPRECHARGE Operation\nThe PRECHARGE command (see Figure 11 (page 30)) is used to deactivate the open row\nin a particular bank or the open row in all banks. The bank(s) will be available for a sub-sequent row access some specified time (\ntRP) after the PRECHARGE command is is-\nsued. Input A10 determines whether one or all banks are to be precharged, and in thecase where only one bank is to be precharged (A10 = LOW), inputs BA0 and BA1 selectthe bank. When all banks are to be precharged (A10 = HIGH), inputs BA0 and BA1 aretreated as “Don’t Care.” After a bank has been precharged, it is in the idle state andmust be activated prior to any READ or WRITE commands being issued to that bank.\nAuto Precharge\nAuto precharge is a feature that performs the same individual-bank PRECHARGE func-tion described previously, without requiring an explicit command. This is accomplishedby using A10 to enable auto precharge in conjunction with a specific READ or WRITEcommand. A precharge of the bank/row that is addressed with the READ or WRITEcommand is automatically performed upon completion of the READ or WRITE burst,except in the continuous page burst mode where auto precharge does not apply. In thespecific case of write burst mode set to single location access with burst length set tocontinuous, the burst length setting is the overriding setting and auto precharge doesnot apply. Auto precharge is nonpersistent in that it is either enabled or disabled foreach individual READ or WRITE command.\nAuto precharge ensures that the precharge is initiated at the earliest valid stage within a\nburst. Another command cannot be issued to the same bank until the precharge time(\ntRP) is completed. This is determined as if an explicit PRECHARGE command was is-\nsued at the earliest possible time, as described for each burst type in the Burst Type(page 41) section.\nMicron SDRAM supports concurrent auto precharge; cases of concurrent auto pre-\ncharge for READs and WRITEs are defined below.\nREAD with auto precharge interrupted by a READ (with or without auto precharge)A READ to bank m will interrupt a READ on bank n following the programmed CAS la-\ntency. The precharge to bank n begins when the READ to bank m is registered (see Fig-\nure 34 (page 63)).\nREAD with auto precharge interrupted by a WRITE (with or without auto precharge)A WRITE to bank m will interrupt a READ on bank n when registered. DQM should be\nused two clocks prior to the WRITE command to prevent bus contention. The pre-charge to bank n begins when the WRITE to bank m is registered (see Figure 35\n(page 64)).\nWRITE with auto precharge interrupted by a READ (with or without auto precharge)A READ to bank m will interrupt a WRITE on bank n when registered, with the data-out\nappearing CL later. The precharge to bank n will begin after \ntWR is met, where tWR be-\ngins when the READ to bank m is registered. The last valid WRITE to bank n will be da-\nta-in registered one clock prior to the READ to bank m (see Figure 40 (page 69)).\nWRITE with auto precharge interrupted by a WRITE (with or without auto precharge)A WRITE to bank m will interrupt a WRITE on bank n when registered.

This command is nonpersistent, so it must be issued eachtime a refresh is required. All active banks must be precharged prior to issuing an AUTOREFRESH command. The AUTO REFRESH command should not be issued until theminimum \ntRP is met following the PRECHARGE command. Addressing is generated by\nthe internal refresh controller. This makes the address bits “Don’t Care” during an AU-TO REFRESH command.\nAfter the AUTO REFRESH command is initiated, it must not be interrupted by any exe-\ncutable command until \ntRFC has been met. During tRFC time, COMMAND INHIBIT or\nNOP commands must be issued on each positive edge of the clock. The SDRAM re-quires that every row be refreshed each \ntREF period. Providing a distributed AUTO RE-\nFRESH command—calculated by dividing the refresh period (tREF) by the number of\nrows to be refreshed—meets the timing requirement and ensures that each row is re-freshed. Alternatively, to satisfy the refresh requirement a burst refresh can be employedafter every \ntREF period by issuing consecutive AUTO REFRESH commands for the num-\nber of rows to be refreshed at the minimum cycle rate (tRFC).64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nAUTO REFRESH Operation\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nSELF REFRESH Operation\nThe self refresh mode can be used to retain data in the device, even when the rest of the\nsystem is powered down. When in self refresh mode, the device retains data without ex-ternal clocking. The SELF REFRESH command is initiated like an AUTO REFRESH com-mand, except CKE is disabled (LOW). After the SELF REFRESH command is registered,all the inputs to the device become “Don’t Care” with the exception of CKE, which mustremain LOW.\nAfter self refresh mode is engaged, the device provides its own internal clocking, ena-\nbling it to perform its own AUTO REFRESH cycles. The device must remain in self re-fresh mode for a minimum period equal to \ntRAS and remains in self refresh mode for an\nindefinite period beyond that.\nThe procedure for exiting self refresh requires a sequence of commands. First, CLK\nmust be stable prior to CKE going back HIGH. (Stable clock is defined as a signal cyclingwithin timing constraints specified for the clock ball.) After CKE is HIGH, the devicemust have NOP commands issued for a minimum of two clocks for \ntXSR because time is\nrequired for the completion of any internal refresh in progress.\nUpon exiting the self refresh mode, AUTO REFRESH commands must be issued accord-\ning to the distributed refresh rate (tREF/refresh row count) as both SELF REFRESH and\nAUTO REFRESH utilize the row refresh counter.64Mb: x32 SDRAM\nSELF REFRESH Operation\nPDF: 09005aef811ce1fe\n64mb_x32_sdram.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nPower-Down\nPower-down occurs if CKE is registered LOW coincident with a NOP or COMMAND IN-\nHIBIT when no accesses are in progress. If power-down occurs when all banks are idle,this mode is referred to as precharge power-down; if power-down occurs when there is arow active in any bank, this mode is referred to as active power-down. Entering power-down deactivates the input and output buffers, excluding CKE, for maximum powersavings while in standby. The device cannot remain in the power-down state longerthan the refresh period (64ms) because no REFRESH operations are performed in thismode.\nThe power-down state is exited by registering a NOP or COMMAND INHIBIT with CKE\nHIGH at the desired clock edge (meeting \ntCKS).\nFigure 48: Power-Down Mode\n \nAll bankstCHtCLtCK\nTwo clock cyclesCKECLK\nDQ\nAll banks idle, enter \npower-down modePrecharge all\nactive banksInput buffers gated off \nwhile in power-down mode\nExit power-down mode(\n)(\n)\nDon’t CaretCKStCKS\nCommandtCMH tCMS\nPRECHARGE NOP NOP ACTIVE NOP(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nAll banks idleBA0, BA1 Bank Bank(s)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nHigh-ZtAH tAStCKHtCKS\nDQM(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nAddressRow (\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)\nSingle bankA10Row(\n)(\n)\n(\n)(\n)T0 T1 T2 Tn + 1 Tn + 2\n(\n)(\n)\nNote: 1.

All rights reserved.\nClock Suspend\nThe clock suspend mode occurs when a column access/burst is in progress and CKE is\nregistered LOW. In the clock suspend mode, the internal clock is deactivated, freezingthe synchronous logic.\nFor each positive clock edge on which CKE is sampled LOW, the next internal positive\nclock edge is suspended. Any command or data present on the input balls when an in-ternal clock edge is suspended will be ignored; any data present on the DQ balls re-mains driven; and burst counters are not incremented, as long as the clock is suspen-ded.\nExit clock suspend mode by registering CKE HIGH; the internal clock and related opera-\ntion will resume on the subsequent positive clock edge.\nFigure 49: Clock Suspend During WRITE Burst\n \nDon’t CareDINCommand\nAddressWRITE\nBank,\nCol n\nDINNOP NOPCLKT2 T1 T4 T3 T5 T0\nCKE\nInternal\nclock\nNOP\nDINDIN\nNote: 1.
