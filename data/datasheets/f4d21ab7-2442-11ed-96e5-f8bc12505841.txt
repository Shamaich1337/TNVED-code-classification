  - Output Voltage (VO): 0 to VCC + 0.5 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Source/Sink Current (IO): ±50 mA
  - Input Diode Current (IIK): -50 mA (VI < GND), +50 mA (VO > VCC)
  - Supply Current (ICC): ±100 mA per supply pin

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Near zero static supply current (10 µA typical)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +85 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - Available in SOIC-14 and TSSOP-14 packages

- **Special Features:**
  - 5.0 V tolerant inputs for compatibility with 5.0 V TTL logic
  - Balanced output sink and source capability of 24 mA
