Long -term exposure to conditions outside normal range, especially at high \nhumidity, may temporarily offset the RH signal (e.g.  +3%RH after 60h kept at >80%RH). After returning into the normal \ntemperature and humidity range the sensor will  slowly come back to calibration state by itself. Prolonged exposure to \nextreme conditions may accelerate ageing. To ensure stable operation of the humidity sensor  please refer to  the document \n“Handling instructions SHT ” Please note as well that this does apply not only to transportation and manufacturing, but also \nto operation of the SHT3x -DIS. \n2 Specifications  \n2.1 Electrical  Specificatio ns \nParameter   Symbol  Condition  Min.

The die \npad is internally connected to VSS. \n3.1 Power Pins (VDD , VSS) \nThe electrical specifications of the SHT3x -DIS are shown \nin Table 3. The  power supply pins must  be decoupled \nwith a 100 nF capacitor that shall be placed as close to \nthe sensor as possible – see Figure 11 for a typical \napplication circuit .  \n3.2 Serial Clock and Serial Data (SCL, SDA)  \nSCL is used to synchronize the communication between \nmicrocontroller and the sensor. The clock frequency can  \nbe freely  chosen b etween 0 to 1000  kHz. Commands \nwith clock stretching according to I2C Standard11 are \nsupported.   \nThe SDA pin is used to transfer data to and from the \nsensor. Communication with frequencies up to 400 kHz \nmust meet the I2C Fast Mode11 standard . \n \n11 http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10204.pdf  Communication frequencies up to 1 Mhz are supported \nfollowing the specifications given in Table 21.  \nBoth SCL and SDA lines are open -drain I/Os with diodes \nto VDD and VSS. They should be connected to external \npull-up resistors (please refer to Figure 11). A device on \nthe I2C bus must only drive a line to ground. The external \npull-up resistors (e.g. Rp=10 kΩ) are required to pull the \nsignal high.  For dimensioning resistor sizes please take \nbus capacity  and communication frequency into account  \n(see for example Section 7.1 of NXPs I2C Manual for \nmore details11). It should be noted that pull -up resistors \nmay be included in I/O circuits of microcontrollers.  It is \nrecommended to wire the sensor ac cording to the \napplication circuit as shown in Figure 11. \n \nFigure 11 Typical application circuit . Please note that the \npositioning of the pins does not reflect the position on the \nreal sensor. This is shown in Table 7. \n3.3 Die Pad (center pad) \nThe die pad or center pad is visible from below and \nlocated in the center of the package. It is electrically  \nconnected to VSS. Hence e lectrical considerations do \nnot impose constraints on the wiring of the die pad. \nHowever, due to mechanical reasons it i s recommended \nto solder the center pad to the PCB. For more \ninformation on design -in, plea se refer to the document \n“SHTxx_STSxx Design Guide”.  \n3.4 ADDR Pin  \nThrough the appropriate wiring of the ADDR pin the I2C \naddress  can be selected  (see Table 8 for the respective \naddresses) . The ADDR pin can either be connected to \nlogic high or  logic low . The address of the sensor can be \nchanged dynamically during operation by switching the \nlevel on the ADDR pin . The only constraint is that the \nlevel has to stay constant starting from the I2C start \ncondition until the communication is finished.  This allows \nto connect more than two  SHT3x -DIS onto the same bus. \n1\n2\n3\n4 58\n7\n6\nVDD\nRRPP\n100nF\nADDR (2)ALERT (3)\ndie \npadR(7)SDA (1)SCL (4)VDD (5)\nVSS (8)nRESET (6)\nDatasheet SHT3x -DIS   \nwww.sensirion.com  December 2022 - Version 7  9/22  \nThe dynamical switching requires individual ADDR lines \nto the sensors.  \nPlease note that the I2C address is represented through \nthe 7 MSBs of the I2C read or write header. The LSB \nswitches between read or write header. The wiring for \nthe default address is show n in Table 8 and Figure 11. \nThe ADDR  pin must not  be left floating.

The output of the pin depends on \nthe value of the RH/T reading relativ e to programmable \nlimits. Its function is explained in a separate  application \nnote. If not used, t his pin must be left floating.  The pin \nswitches high, when alert conditions are met. The \nmaximum driving loads are listed  in Table 3. Be aware \nthat self -heating might occur, depend ing on the amount \nof current that flows. Self -heating can be prevented if the \nAlert Pin is only used to switch a transistor.  \n3.6 nRESET Pin \nThe nReset pin may be used to generate a reset of the \nsensor. A minimum pulse duration of 1 µs is required to \nreliably  trigger a reset of the sensor. Its function is \nexplained in more detail in section  4. If not used it is \nrecommended to leave the pin floating or to connect it to \nVDD with a series resistor of R ≥2  kΩ. However, the \nnRESET pin is internally connected to VDD with a pull \nup resis tor of R = 50 kΩ (typ.).  \n \n4 Operation and Communication  \nThe SHT3x -DIS supports I2C fast mode (and \nfrequencies  up to 1000  kHz). Clock stretching  can be \nenabled and disabled through the appropriate user \ncommand . For detailed information on the I2C protoco l, \nrefer to NXP I2C -bus specification12.  \n \n12 http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10204.pdf   After sending a command to the sensor a minimal \nwaiting time of 1ms is needed before another command \ncan be received by the sensor . \nAll SHT3x -DIS commands and data are mapped to a 16 -\nbit address space. Ad ditional ly, data and commands are \nprotected with a CRC checksum. This increases \ncommunication reliability. The 16 bits c ommands to the \nsensor  alrea dy include a 3 bit CRC checksum. Data sent \nfrom and received by the sensor  is always succ eeded by \nan 8 bit CRC.  \nIn write direction it is mandatory to transmit the  \nchecksum, since the SHT3x -DIS only accepts  data if it is \nfollowed by the correct checksum. In read direction it is \nleft to the master to read and process the checksum.  \n4.1 Power -Up and Communication Start \nThe s ensor starts powering -up after reaching the power -\nup threshold voltage V POR specified in Table 3. After \nreaching this threshold voltage the sensor  needs the \ntime t PU to enter idle state. Once the idle state is entered \nit is ready to receive commands from the master \n(microcontroller).  \nEach transmission sequence begins with a START \ncondition (S) and ends with a STOP condition (P) as \ndescribed in the I2C -bus specification. Whenever the \nsensor is powered up, but not performing a \nmeasurement or communicating, it automatically enters \nidle state for energy saving. This idle  state cannot be \ncontrolled  by the user.  \n4.2 Starting a Measurement  \nA measurement communicati on sequence consists of a \nSTART condition, the I2C write header (7 -bit I2C device \naddress plus 0 as the write bit) and a 16 -bit \nmeasurement command. The proper reception of each \nbyte is indicated by the sensor. It pulls the SDA pin low \n(ACK bit) after the falling edge of the 8th SCL clock to \nindicate the reception. A complete measurement cycle is \ndepicted in Table 9. \nWith the acknowledgement  of the measurement \ncommand, the SHT3x -DIS starts measuring humidity \nand temperature.  \n4.3 Measurement Commands for Single Shot \nData Acquisition Mode \nIn this mode one issued measurement command \ntriggers the acquisition of one data pair . Each d ata pair \nconsists of one 16 bit temperature and one 16 bit \nhumidity value (in this order). During transmission each \ndata value  is always followed by a CRC checksum, see \nsection 4.4. \n \nDatasheet SHT3x -DIS   \nwww.sensirion.com  December 2022 - Version 7  10/22  \nIn single shot mode different measurement commands \ncan be selected. The 16 bit commands are shown in \nTable 9. They differ with respe ct to repeatability (low, \nmedium and high) and clock stretching (enabled or \ndisabled).  \nThe repeatability setting  influences t he measurement \nduration and thus the overall  energy consumption of the \nsens or. This is explained in section 2. \nCondition  Hex. code  \nRepeatability  Clock \nstretching  MSB  LSB \nHigh \nenabled  0x2C  06 \nMedium  0D \nLow 10 \nHigh \ndisabled  0x24 00 \nMedium  0B \nLow 16 \ne.g. 0x2C06: high repeatability measurement with clock \nstretching enabled  \n \nTable 9 Measurement commands in single shot mode . The \nfirst “SCL free” block indicates a minimal waiting time of 1ms.  \n(Clear blocks are controlled by the microcontroller, grey \nblocks by the sensor ). \n4.4 Readout of Measurement R esults for \nSingle Shot Mode \nAfter the sensor has completed the measurement, the \nmaster can read the measurement results (pair of RH& \nT) by sending a START condition followed by an I2C \nread header. The sensor will acknowledge the reception \nof the read header and send two bytes of data  \n(temperature) followed by one byte CRC checksum and \nanother two bytes of data (relative humidity) followed by \none byte CRC checksum. Each byte must be \nacknowledged by the microcontroller with an ACK \ncondition for the sensor to continue sending data. If th e sensor does not receive an ACK from the master after \nany byte of data, it will not continue sending data.  \nThe sensor will send the temperature value first and then \nthe relative humidity value. After having received  the \nchecksum for the humidity value a NACK and stop \ncondition should be sent (see Table 9). \nThe I2C master can abort the read transfer with a NACK \ncondition after any data byte if it is not  interested in \nsubsequent data, e.g. the CRC byte or the second \nmeasurement result, in order to save time.   \nIn case the user needs humidity and temperature data \nbut does not want to process CRC data, it is \nrecommended to read the  two temperature bytes of d ata \nwith the CRC byte (without processing the CRC data) ; \nafter having re ad the two humidity bytes, the read \ntransfer  can be aborted with a with a NACK.  \nNo Clock Stretching  \nWhen a command with out clock stretching has been \nissued, the sensor responds to a read header with a  not \nacknowledge (NACK) , if no data is present .  \nClock Stretching  \nWhen a command with clock stretching has been issued, \nthe sensor responds to a read header with an ACK and \nsubse quently pulls down the SCL line. The SCL line is \npulled down until the measurement is complete. As soon \nas the measurement is complete, the sensor releases \nthe SCL line and send s the measurement results . \n  \n4.5 Measurement Commands for Periodic  \nData Acquisition Mode \nIn this mode one issued measurement command yields \na stream of data pairs . Each data pair consists of one 16 \nbit temperature and one 16 bit humidity value (in this \norder).  \nIn periodic  mode different measurement commands can \nbe selected. Th e corresponding 16 bit commands are \nshown in Table 10. They differ with respect to \nrepeatability (low, medium  and high) and data \nacquisition frequency (0.5, 1, 2, 4 & 10 measurements \nper second, mps). Clock stretching cannot be selected in \nthis mode.  \nThe data acquisition frequency and the repeatability \nsetting influences the measurement duration and the \ncurrent consumption of the sensor. This is explaine d in \nsection  2 of this datasheet.  \nIf a measurement command is issued, while the sensor \nis busy with a measurement (measurement durations \nsee Table 4), it is recommended to issue a break \ncommand first (see section 4.8). Upon reception of the \n\nDatasheet SHT3x -DIS   \nwww.sensirion.com  December 2022 - Version 7  11/22  \nbreak command the sensor abort the ongoing \nmeasurement  and enter the single shot mode . \nCondition  Hex. code \nRepeatability  mps MSB  LSB \nHigh \n0.5 0x20  32 \nMedium  24 \nLow 2F \nHigh \n1 0x21  30 \nMedium  26 \nLow 2D \nHigh \n2 0x22  36 \nMedium  20 \nLow 2B \nHigh \n4 0x23  34 \nMedium  22 \nLow 29 \nHigh \n10 0x27  37 \nMedium  21 \nLow 2A \ne.g. 0x2 130: 1 high repeatability mps - measurement per \nsecond  \n \nTable 10 Measurement commands for periodic data \nacquisition mode ( Clear blocks are controlled by the \nmicrocontroller, grey blocks by the sensor ). N.B.: At the \nhighest mps setting  self-heating of the sensor might occur.  \n4.6 Readout of M easurement Results for \nPeriodic Mode  \nTransmission of the measurement data can be initiated \nthrough the fetch data command shown in Table 11. If \nno measurement data is present the I2C read  header is \nrespond ed with a NACK (Bit 9 in Table 11) and the \ncommunication stops. After the read out command fetch \ndata has been issued, the data mem ory is cleared , i.e. \nno measurement data is present.   Command  Hex c ode \nFetch Data  0x E0 00  \n \nTable 11 Fetch Data  command (Clear blocks are controlled \nby the microcontroller, grey blocks by the sensor ). \n4.7 ART Command  \nThe ART (accelerated response time) feature can be \nactivated by issuing the command in Table 12. After \nissuing the ART command the sensor will start ac quiring \ndata with a frequency of 4Hz.   \nThe ART command is structurally similar to any other \ncommand in Table 10. Hence section 4.5 applies for \nstarting a measurement, section 4.6 for reading out data \nand section 4.8 for stopping the periodic data ac quisition.  \nThe ART feature can also be evaluated using the \nEvaluation Kit EK -H5 from Sensirion.  \nCommand  Hex Code  \nPeriodic Measurement with \nART 0x2B32  \n \nTable 12 Command for a periodic data acquisition with \nthe ART feature  (Clear blocks are controlled by the \nmicrocontroller, grey blocks by the sensor ). \n4.8 Break command / Stop Periodic  Data \nAcquisition Mode  \nThe periodic data acquisition mode can be stopped using \nthe break command shown in Table 13. It is \nrecommended to stop the periodic data acquisition pr ior \nto sending another command  (except Fetch Data \ncommand)  using the break command. Upon reception of \nthe break command the sensor will abort the ongoing \nmeasurement and enter the single shot mode. This takes \n1ms.  \nS\nACKW I2C Address1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nACKCommand MSB1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nACKCommand LSB10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n16-bit  command I2C write header\nS\nACKW I2C Address1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nACKCommand MSB1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nACKCommand LSB10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n16-bit  command I2C write header\nDatasheet SHT3x -DIS   \nwww.sensirion.com  December 2022 - Version 7  12/22  \nCommand  Hex Code  \nBreak  0x3093  \n \nTable 13 Break c ommand ( Clear blocks are controlled by \nthe microcontroller, grey blocks by the sensor ). \n \n4.9 Reset  \nA system reset  of the  SHT3x -DIS can be generated \nexternally by issuing a command (soft reset) or by \nsending a pulse to the dedicated reset pin (nReset pin). \nAdditionally, a system reset is gene rated internally \nduring power -up. During the reset procedure the sensor \nwill not process comma nds.  \nIn order to achieve a full reset of the sensor without \nremoving the power supply, it is recommended to use the \nnRESET pin of the SHT3x -DIS.  \nInterface Reset  \nIf communication with the device is lost , the following \nsignal  sequence will reset the se rial interface: While \nleaving  SDA high, toggle SCL  nine or more times. This \nmust be followed by a Transmission Start  sequence \npreceding the next command. This sequence  resets the \ninterface only. The status register preserves its  content.  \nSoft R eset / Re-Initialization  \nThe SHT3x -DIS provides a soft reset mechanism that \nforces the system into a well -defined state without \nremoving the power supply. When the system is in idle \nstate the soft reset command can be sent to the SHT3x -\nDIS. This triggers the sensor to reset its system \ncontroller and reloads calibration data from the memory. \nIn order to start the soft reset procedure the command  \nas shown in Table 14 should be sent .  \nIt is worth noting that the sensor reloads calibration data \nprior to every measurement by default.  \nCommand  Hex Code  \nSoft Reset  0x30A2  \n \nTable 14 Soft reset command ( Clear blocks are controlled \nby the microcontroller, grey blocks by the sensor ). \nReset through General Call  \nAdditionally, a reset of the sensor can also be generated \nusing the “general call” mode according to I2C -bus \nspecification12. This generates a reset which is functionally identical to using the nReset  pin. It is \nimportant to understand that a reset generated in this \nway is not device specific. All devices on the same I2C \nbus that support the general call mode will perform a \nreset. Additionally, this command only works when the \nsensor is able to process  I2C commands. The \nappropriate command consists of two bytes and is \nshown in Table 15. \nCommand  Code  \nAddress byte  0x00  \nSecond byte  0x06  \nReset command using the \ngener al call address  0x0006  \n \nTable 15 Reset through the general c all address ( Clear \nblocks are controlled by the microcontroller, grey blocks by \nthe sensor ).  \n \nReset  through the nReset Pin  \nPulling the nReset  pin low (see Table 7) generates a \nreset similar to a hard reset. The nReset  pin is internally \nconnected to VDD through a pull -up resistor and hence \nactive low. The nReset pin has to be pulled low for a \nminimum of 1 µs to generate a reset of the sensor.  \nHard  Reset \nA hard reset is achieved by switching the supply voltage \nto the V DD Pin off and then on again. In order to prevent \npowering the sensor over the ESD diodes, the voltage to \npins 1 ( SDA), 4 (SCL) and 2  (ADDR) also needs to be \nremoved.  \n4.10 Heater  \nThe SHT3x  is equipped with an internal heater, which  \nis meant for plausibility checking only. The temperature  \nincrease achieved by the heater depends on various  \nparameters and lies in the range of a few degrees  \ncentigrade. It  can be switched on and off by command, \nsee table below. The status is listed in the status register. \nAfter a reset the heater is disabled (default condition).  \nS\nACKGeneral Call Address1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nACKReset Command1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nGeneral Call 1st byte General Call 2nd byte\nDatasheet SHT3x -DIS   \nwww.sensirion.com  December 2022 - Version 7  13/22  \nCommand  Hex Code  \nMSB  LSB \nHeater Enable  0x30  6D \nHeater Disabled  66 \n \nTable 16 Heater command  (Clear blocks are controlled by \nthe microcontroller, grey blocks by the sensor ). \n4.11 Status Register  \nThe status register contains information on the \noperational status of the heater, the alert mode and on \nthe execution status of the last command and the last \nwrite sequence.

DFN stands for dual flat no leads. The humidity \nsensor opening is centered on the top side of the \npackage.  \nThe sensor chip is made of sili con and is mounted to a \nlead frame. The latter is made of Cu plated with \nNi/Pd/Au. Chip and lead frame are overmolded by a n \nepoxy -based mold compound  leaving the central die pad \nand I/O pins exposed for mechanical and electrical \nconnection . Please note tha t the side walls of the sensor \nare diced and therefore these diced lead frame surfaces \nare not covered with the respective plating.  \nThe package  (except for the humidity sensor opening)  \nfollows JEDEC publication 95, design registration 4.20, \nsmall scale pla stic quad and dual inline, square and \nrectangular, No -LEAD packages (with optional thermal \nenhancements) small scale (QFN/SON) , Issue D.01, \nSeptember 2009.  \nSHT3x -DIS has a Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) of 1, \naccording to IPC/JEDEC J -STD-020. At the same time, \nit is recommended to further process the sensors within \n1 year after date of delivery.  \n5.1 Traceability  \nAll SHT3x -DIS sensors are laser marked for easy \nidentifi cation and traceability. The marking on the sensor \ntop side consists of a pin -1 indicator  and two lines of text .  The top line consist s of the pin-1 indicator which is \nlocated in the top left corner and the product name. The \nsmall letter x stands for the a ccuracy class.  \nThe bottom line consists of 6 letters. The first two digits \nXY (=DI) describe  the output mode. The third letter (A) \nrepresents the manufacturing year (4 = 2014, 5 = 2015, \netc). The last three digits  (BCD)  represent an  \nalphanumeric tra cking code. That code can be decoded \nby Sensirion only and allows for tracking on batch level  \nthrough production, calibration and testing – and will be  \nprovided upon justified request.   \nIf viewed from below pin 1 is indicated by triangular \nshaped cut in th e otherwise rectangular die pad. The \ndimension s of the triangular cut are shown in Figure 14 \nthrough the labels T1 & T2 . \n \nFigure 13 Top view of the SHT3x -DIS illustrating the laser \nmarking.  \nSHT3x\nXYABCD\nDatasheet SHT3x -DIS   \nwww.sensirion.com  December 2022 - Version 7  17/22  \n5.2  Package Outline  \n \nFigure 14 Dimensional drawing of SHT3x -DIS sensor package  \n \n \nParameter  Symbol  Min Nom.

The land pattern is \nunderstood to be the open metal areas  on the PCB, onto \nwhich the DFN pads are soldered.  \nThe solder mask is understood to be the insulating layer \non top of the PCB covering the copper traces . It is \nrecommended to design the solder pads as a Non-\nSolder Mask Defined (NSMD) type. For NSMD pads, the \nsolder mask opening should provid e a 60 μm to 75  μm \ndesign clearance between any copper pad and solder \nmask. As the pad pitch is only 0.5 mm we recommend to \nhave one solder mask opening for all 4 I/O pads on one \nside.  For solder paste printing it is recommended to use a \nlaser -cut, stainless steel stencil with electro -polished \ntrapezoidal walls and with 0.1  or 0.125  mm stencil \nthickness . The length of the stencil apertures for the I/O \npads should be the same as the PCB pads . However, \nthe position of the stencil apertures should have an offset \nof 0.1 mm away from the center of the package. The die \npad aperture sh ould cover about 70 – 90 % of the die \npad area –thus it should have a size of about  0.9 mm x \n1.6 mm.  \nFor information on the soldering process and further \nrecommendation on the assembly  process please \nconsult the Handlin  Instruction SHT, which can be found \non the Sensirion webpage.   \n \n\nDatasheet SHT3x -DIS   \nwww.sensirion.com  December 2022 - Version 7  18/22  \n \nFigure 15 Recommended metal land pattern  (left) and stencil apertures  (right)  for SHT3x -DIS.
