It appears that the information provided does not include a specific product code or detailed specifications for the HS1 production from NEXTRONICS ENGINEERING CORP. Instead, the text seems to reference a company name in Chinese, which translates to "Nidec Corporation" and "Chaun-Choung Technology Corp." without any specific details about the component itself.

To provide a thorough and accurate technical summary, I would need the specific product code or a datasheet that outlines the characteristics and specifications of the HS1 component. If you can provide that information, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing the key parameters, description, and typical applications of the component.
