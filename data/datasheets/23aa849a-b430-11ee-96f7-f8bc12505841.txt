The interconnect is non-blocking and supports \nmultiple simultaneous master-slave transactions.\nThe interconnect is designed with latency sensitive masters, such as the Arm CPU, having the shortest \npaths to memory, and bandwidth critical masters, such as the potential PL masters, having high \nthroughput connections to the slaves with which they need to communicate.\nTraffic through the interconnect can be regulated through the Quality of Service (QoS) block in the \ninterconnect. The QoS feature is used to regulate traffic generated by the CPU, DMA controller, and a \ncombined entity representing the masters in the IOP.\nPS Interfaces\nPS interfaces include external interfaces goin g off-chip or signals going from PS to PL. \nPS External Interfaces\nThe Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC’s external interfaces use de dicated pins that cannot be  assigned as PL pins. \nThese include:\n\uf0b7Clock, reset, boot mode, and voltage reference\n\uf0b7Up to 78 dedicated multiplexed I/O (MIO) pins, software -configurable to connect to  any of the internal I/O \nperipherals and static  memory controllers\n\uf0b732-bit or 64-bit DDR4/DDR3/DDR3L/L PDDR3 memories with optional ECC\n\uf0b732-bit LPDDR4 memory with optional ECC\n\uf0b74 channels (TX and RX pair) for transceivers \nMIO Overview\nThe IOP peripherals communicate to external device s through a shared pool of up to 78 dedicated \nmultiplexed I/O (MIO) pins. Each peripheral can be assigned one of several pre-defined groups of pins, enabling a flexible assignment of multiple devices simultaneously. Although 78 pins are not enough for \nsimultaneous use of all the I/O peripherals, most IOP interface signals are available to the PL, allowing use \nof standard PL I/O pins when powered up and properly  configured. Extended mult iplexed I/O (EMIO) allows \nunmapped PS peripherals to access PL I/O.\nPort mappings can appear in multip le locations. For example, there ar e up to 12 possible port mappings \nfor CAN pins.

The six dedicated AXI memory port s from the PL to the PS are configurable as either 128-bit, 64-bit, \nor 32-bit interfaces. These interfaces connect the PL to  the memory interconnect via a FIFO interface.

The ACP directly connects the \nPL to the snoop control unit (SCU) of the Arm Cortex -A53 processors, enabling cache-coherent access to \nCPU data in the L2 cache. The ACP provides a low latency path between the PS and a PL-based accelerator when compared with a legacy cache flushing and loading scheme. The ACP only snoops access in the CPU \nL2 cache, providing coherency in hard ware. It does not support coherency on the PL side. So this interface \nis ideal for a DMA or an accelerator in the PL that only requires coherency on the CPU cache memories. For \nexample, if a MicroBlaze™ processor in the PL is at tached to the ACP interface, the cache of MicroBlaze \nprocessor will not be cohere nt with Cortex-A53 caches. \nAXI Coherency Extension (ACE) \nThe Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC AXI cohere ncy extension (ACE) is a 64-bit AXI4  slave interface that provides \nconnectivity between the APU and a po tential accelerator function in th e PL. The ACE directly connects the \nPL to the snoop control unit (SCU) of the Arm Cortex -A53 processors, enabling cache-coherent access to \nCache Coherent Interconnect (CCI). The ACE provides  a low-latency path between the PS and a PL-based \naccelerator when compared with a legacy cache flushi ng and loading scheme. The ACE snoops accesses to \nthe CCI and the PL side, thus, providing full coherency in  hardware. This interface can be used to hook up \na cached interface in the PL to the PS as caches on  both the Cortex-A53 memories and the PL master are \nsnooped thus providing full coherency. For example, if a MicroBlaze processor in the PL is hooked up using \nan ACE interface, then Cortex-A53 and MicroBlaze pr ocessor caches will be coherent with each other. \nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 27\nProgrammable Logic\nThis section covers the information about blocks in the Programmable Logic (PL).\nDevice Layout\nUltraScale architecture-based devices are arranged in a column-and-grid layout. Columns of resources are combined \nin different ratios to provide the optimum capability for the device density, target market or application, and device \ncost. At the core of UltraScale+ MPSoCs is the processing system that displaces some of the full or partial columns \nof programmable logic resources. Figure 1  shows a device-level view with reso urces grouped togeth er. For simplicity, \ncertain resources such as the processing system, integrated blocks for PCIe, configuration logic, and System Monitor \nare not shown. \nResources within the device are divided into segmented clock regions. The height of a clock region is 60 CLBs. A bank \nof 52 I/Os, 24 DSP slices, 12 block RAMs , or 4 transceiver channels also matches the height of a clock region. The \nwidth of a clock region is essentially the same in all cases,  regardless of device size or  the mix of resources in the \nregion, enabling repeatable timing results. Each segmen ted clock region contains ve rtical and horizontal clock \nrouting that span its full height and width. These horizontal  and vertical clock routes can be segmented at the clock \nregion boundary to provide a flex ible, high-performance, low-power clock distribution architecture.

In addition, in the \nMPSoC’s PS, there are another 78 I/Os that the I/ O peripherals use to communicate to external \ncomponents, referred to as mu ltiplexed I/O (MIO). If more than 78 pins are required by the I/O peripherals, \nthe I/O pins in the PL can be used to extend the MP SoC interfacing capability, re ferred to as extended MIO \n(EMIO).\nThe number of I/O pins in the PL of Zynq UltraScale + MPSoCs varies depending on device and package. \nEach I/O is configurable and can comply with a larg e number of I/O standards. The I/Os are classed as \nhigh-performance (HP), or high-density (HD). Th e HP I/Os are optimized for highest performance \noperation, from 1.0V to 1.8V. The HD I/Os are redu ced-feature I/Os organized in banks of 24, providing \nvoltage support from 1.2V to 3.3V.\nAll I/O pins are organized in banks, with 52 HP pins per bank or 24 HD pins per bank. Each bank has one \ncommon VCCO output buffer power supply, which also powers  certain input buffers. Some single-ended \ninput buffers require an internally generated or an externally appl ied reference voltage (VREF). VREF pins \ncan be driven directly from the PCB or internally generated using the internal VREF generator circuitry \npresent in each bank.\nI/O Electrical Characteristics\nSingle-ended outputs use a conven tional CMOS push/pull output structure driving High towards VCCO or \nLow towards ground, and can be put into a high-Z state.  The system designer can specify the slew rate and \nthe output strength. The input is always active but is  usually ignored while the output is active. Each pin \ncan optionally have a weak pull-up or a weak pull-down resistor.\nMost signal pin pairs can be configured as differentia l input pairs or output pa irs. Differential input pin \npairs can optionally be terminated with a 100 \uf057 internal resistor. All UltraSca le architecture-based devices \nsupport differential standards beyo nd LVDS, including RSDS, BLVDS, differential SSTL, and differential \nHSTL. Each of the I/Os supports memory I/O standards, such as single-ended and differential HSTL as well as single-ended and differential SSTL. The Zynq Ul traScale+ family includes support for MIPI with a \ndedicated D-PHY in the I/O bank.\n3-State Digitally Controlled Impedance and Low Power I/O Features\nThe 3-state Digitally Cont rolled Impedance (T_DCI) can control the output drive impedance (series \ntermination) or can provide parallel te rmination of an input signal to VCCO or split (Thevenin) termination \nto VCCO/2. This allows users to eliminate off-chip termina tion for signals using T_DCI. In addition to board \nspace savings, the termination automatically turns o ff when in output mode or when 3-stated, saving \nconsiderable power compared to off-chip termination . The I/Os also have low power modes for IBUF and \nIDELAY to provide further power savings, especially when used to implement memory interfaces.\nI/O Logic\nInput and Output Delay\nAll inputs and outputs can be configured as either co mbinatorial or registered. Double data rate (DDR) is \nsupported by all inputs and outputs. Any input or output can be individually delayed by up to 1,250ps of \nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 29\ndelay with a resolution of 5–15ps. Such delays are implemented as IDELAY and ODELAY. The number of \ndelay steps can be set by configuration and can also  be incremented or decremented while in use. The \nIDELAY and ODELAY can be cascaded together to do uble the amount of delay in a single direction.\nISERDES and OSERDES\nMany applications combine high-speed, bit-serial I/O wi th slower parallel operation inside the device. This \nrequires a serializer and deserializer (SerDes) inside the I/O logic. Each I/O pin possesses an IOSERDES \n(ISERDES and OSERDES) capable of performing serial-t o-parallel or parallel-to- serial conversions with \nprogrammable widths of 2, 4, or 8 bits. These I/O logic features enable high-performance interfaces, such \nas Gigabit Ethernet/1000BaseX/SGMII, to be moved from the transceivers to the SelectIO interface.\nHigh-Speed Serial Transceivers\nUltra-fast  serial data transmission between devices on the same PCB, over backplanes, and across even \nlonger distances is becoming incr easingly important for scaling to 100 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s line cards. \nSpecialized dedicated on-chip circuitry and differential  I/O capable of coping with the signal integrity \nissues are required at these high data rates.\nThree types of transceivers are used in Zynq UltraSca le+ MPSoCs: GTH, GTY, and PS-GTR. All transceivers \nare arranged in groups of four, known as a transc eiver Quad. Each serial transceiver is a combined \ntransmitter and receiver. Table 10  compares the available transceivers.\nThe following information in this section pertains to the GTH and GTY only.\nThe serial transmitter and receiver are independent circ uits that use an advanced phase-locked loop (PLL) \narchitecture to multiply the reference frequency input by certain programmable numbers between 4 and \n25 to become the bit-serial data clock. Each transcei ver has a large number of user-definable features and \nparameters. All of these can be defined during devi ce configuration, and many can also be modified \nduring operation. \nTransmitter\nThe transmitter is fundamentally a parallel-to-serial co nverter with a conversion ratio of 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, \nor 80 for the GTH and 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, 80, 128, or 160 for the GTY. This allows the designer to trade off \ndatapath width against timing margin in high-perfo rmance designs. These transmitter outputs drive the \nPC board with a single-channel differential output si gnal. TXOUTCLK is the appropriately divided serial \ndata clock and can be used directly to register th e parallel data coming from the internal logic. The \nincoming parallel data is fed th rough an optional FIFO and has ad ditional hardware  support for the \n8B/10B, 64B/66B, or 64B/67B encoding schemes to provide a sufficient number of transitions.

This output signal pair has \nprogrammable signal swing as well as programmable pre- and post-emphasis to compensate for PC board \nlosses and other interconnect charac teristics. For shorter channels, the swing can be reduced to reduce \npower consumption.\nReceiver\nThe receiver is fundamentally a seri al-to-parallel converter, changing th e incoming bit-serial differential \nsignal into a parallel stream of words, each 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, or 80 bits in the GTH or 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, 80, \n128, or 160 for the GTY. This allows the designer to tr ade off internal datapath width against logic timing \nmargin. The receiver takes the incoming differentia l data stream, feeds it through programmable DC \nautomatic gain control, linear and decision feedback  equalizers (to compensate for PC board, cable, \noptical and other interconnect characteristics), and uses the reference clock input to initiate clock \nrecognition. There is no need for a separate clock line. The data pattern uses non-return-to-zero (NRZ) \nencoding and optionally ensures sufficient data tr ansitions by using the selected encoding scheme. \nParallel data is then transferred into the device lo gic using the RXUSRCLK clock. For short channels, the \ntransceivers offer a special low-power mode (LPM) to  reduce power consumption by approximately 30%. \nThe receiver DC automatic gain cont rol and linear and decision feed back equalizers can optionally \n“auto-adapt” to automatically learn and compensate for different interconnect characteristics. This \nenables even more margin for tough 10G+ and 25G+ backplanes.\nOut-of-Band Signaling\nThe transceivers provide out-of-band (OOB) signaling,  often used to send low-speed signals from the \ntransmitter to the receiver while high-speed serial data  transmission is not active. This is typically done \nwhen the link is in a powered-down state or has not ye t been initialized. This benefits PCIe and SATA/SAS \nand QPI applications.\nIntegrated Blocks for PCI Express Designs\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs include integrated bloc ks for PCIe that are compliant PCI Express Base \nSpecification Revision 3.1 and can operate with a lane width of up to x16 and a speed up to 8.0GT/s (Gen3).\nAll integrated blocks for PCIe can be configured as En dpoint or Root Port. The Root Port can be used to \nbuild the basis for a compatible Root Complex, to allow custom chip-to-chip communication via the PCI \nExpress protocol, and to attach ASSP Endpoint device s, such as Ethernet Controllers or Fibre Channel \nHBAs, to the MPSoC.\nThis block is highly configurable to  system design requirements and can operate 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 lanes at \nup to 2.5Gb/s, 5.0Gb/s, or 8.0Gb/s data rates. For high-performance applications, advanced buffering \ntechniques of the block offer a flexible maximum payl oad size of up to 1,024 bytes. The integrated block \ninterfaces to the integrated high-speed transceivers  for serial connectivity an d to block RAMs for data \nbuffering. Combined, these elements implement the Physic al Layer, Data Link Layer, and Transaction Layer \nof the PCI Express protocol.\nXilinx provides LogiCORE™ IP options to configure the integrated blocks for PCIe in all UltraScale and \nUltraScale+ devices. This includes AXI Streaming interf aces at the PCIe packet level and more advanced IP \nsuch as AXI to PCIe Bridges and DMA engines. This IP  gives the designer control over many configurable \nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 31\nparameters such as link width and speed, maximum payload size, and reference clock frequency.

Interlaken is a \nscalable chip-to-chip interconnect protocol designed to enable transmission speeds from 10Gb/s to \n150Gb/s. The Interlaken integrated block in the UltraSca le architecture is compliant to revision 1.2 of the \nInterlaken specification with data striping and de-s triping across 1 to 12 lanes. Permitted configurations \nare: 1 to 12 lanes at up to 12.5Gb/s and 1 to 6 lane s at up to 25.78125Gb/s, enabling flexible support for \nup to 150Gb/s per integrated block. With multiple Inte rlaken blocks, certain UltraScale architecture-based \ndevices enable easy, reliable Interlaken switches and bridges.\nIntegrated Block for 100G Ethernet\nCompliant to the IEEE Std 802.3ba, the 100G Ethernet integrated blocks in the UltraScale architecture \nprovide low latency 100Gb/s Ethernet ports with a wi de range of user customization and statistics \ngathering. With support for 10 x 10.3125Gb/s (CAUI)  and 4 x 25.78125Gb/s (CAUI-4) configurations, the \nintegrated block includes both the 100G MAC and PC S logic with support for IEEE Std 1588v2 1-step and \n2-step hardware timestamping.\nIn UltraScale+ devices, the 100G Ethernet blocks  contain a Reed Solomon Forward Error Correction \n(RS-FEC) block, compliant to IEEE Std 802.3bj, that can be used with the Ethernet block or stand alone in \nuser applications. These families also support OT N mapping mode in which the PCS can be operate \nwithout using the MAC.\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 32\nClock Management\nThe clock generation and distribution components in  UltraScale architecture-based devices are located \nadjacent to the columns that contain the memory inte rfacing and input and output circuitry. This tight \ncoupling of clocking and I/O provides  low-latency clocking to the I/O fo r memory interfaces and other I/O \nprotocols. Within every clock ma nagement tile (CMT) resides one mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM), \ntwo PLLs, clock distribution buffers and routing, and dedicated circuitry for implementing external \nmemory interfaces.\nMixed-Mode Clock Manager\nThe mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) can serve as  a frequency synthesize r for a wide range of \nfrequencies and as a jitter filter for incoming clocks . At the center of the MMCM is a voltage-controlled \noscillator (VCO), which speeds up and slows down depending on the input voltage it receives from the phase frequency detector (PFD).\nThree sets of programmable frequency dividers (D , M, and O) are programmable by configuration and \nduring normal operation via the Dynamic Reconfiguratio n Port (DRP). The pre-divider D reduces the input \nfrequency and feeds one input of the phase/frequency comparator. The feedback divider M acts as a \nmultiplier because it divides the VCO output frequency before feeding the other input of the phase comparator. D and M must be chosen appropriately to keep the VCO within its sp ecified frequency range. \nThe VCO has eight equally-spaced output phases (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225° , 270°, and 315°). Each \nphase can be selected to drive one of the output dividers, and each divider is programmable by configuration to divide by any integer from 1 to 128.\nThe MMCM has three input-jitter filter options: low bandwidth, high bandwidth, or optimized mode. \nLow-Bandwidth mode has the best jit ter attenuation. High-Bandwidth mode has the best phase offset. \nOptimized mode allows the tools to find the best setting.\nThe MMCM can have a fractional counter in either the feedback path (acting as a multiplier) or in one \noutput path. Fractional counters allow non-integer in crements of 1/8 and can thus increase frequency \nsynthesis capabilities by a factor of 8. The MMCM ca n also provide fixed or dynamic phase shift in small \nincrements that depend on the VCO frequency. At 1,600MHz, the phase-shift timing increment is 11.2ps.\nPLL\nWith fewer features than the MMCM, the two PLLs in  a clock management tile are primarily present to \nprovide the necessary clocks to the dedicated memory interface circuitry. The circuit at the center of the \nPLLs is similar to the MMCM, with PFD feeding a VC O and programmable M, D, and O counters. There are \ntwo divided outputs to the device fabric per PLL as we ll as one clock plus one enable signal to the memory \ninterface circuitry.\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs are equipped with five additi onal PLLs in the PS for independently configuring \nthe four primary clock domains with the PS: the APU, the RPU, the DDR controller, and the I/O peripherals.\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 33\nClock Distribution\nClocks are distributed throughout Zynq UltraScale+ MP SoCs via buffers that drive a number of vertical \nand horizontal tracks. There are 24 horizontal clock rout es per clock region and 24 vertical clock routes per \nclock region with 24 additional vertical clock routes  adjacent to the MMCM and PLL. Within a clock region, \nclock signals are routed to the device logic (CLBs, etc.) via 16 gateable leaf clocks.\nSeveral types of clock buffers are av ailable. The BUFGCE and BUFCE_LEAF buffers provide clock gating at \nthe global and leaf levels, respectively. BUFGCTRL pr ovides glitchless clock muxi ng and gating capability. \nBUFGCE_DIV has clock gating capability and can divide a clock by 1 to 8. BUFG_GT performs clock division \nfrom 1 to 8 for the transceiver clocks. In MPSoCs, clocks can be transferred from the PS to the PL using dedicated buffers.\nMemory Interfaces\nMemory interface data rates continue  to increase, driving the need for dedicated circuitry that enables \nhigh performance, reliable inte rfacing to current and next-generation memory technologies. \nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs include dedicated physical interfaces (PHY) blocks located between the CMT \nand I/O columns that support implementation of high -performance PHY blocks to external memories such \nas DDR4, DDR3, QDRII+, and RLDRAM3. The PHY blocks  in each I/O bank generate the address/control \nand data bus signaling protocols as well as the pr ecision clock/data alignment required to reliably \ncommunicate with a variety of high-performance memo ry standards. Multiple I/ O banks can be used to \ncreate wider memory interfaces. \nAs well as external parallel memory interfaces, Zy nq UltraScale+ MPSoC can communicate to external \nserial memories, such as Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), via the high-speed serial transceivers. All \ntransceivers in the UltraScale architecture support the HMC protocol, up to 15Gb/s line rates. UltraScale \narchitecture-based devices support the highest band width HMC configuration of 64 lanes with a single \ndevice.\nConfigurable Logic Block\nEvery Configurable Logic Block (CLB) in the UltraScale  architecture contains 8 LUTs and 16 flip-flops. The \nLUTs can be configured as either one 6-input LUT with  one output, or as two 5-input LUTs with separate \noutputs but common inputs. Each LUT can optionally be registered in a flip-flop. In addition to the LUTs \nand flip-flops, the CLB contains arit hmetic carry logic and multiplexers to create wider logic functions. \nEach CLB contains one slice. There are two types of s lices: SLICEL and SLICEM. LUTs in the SLICEM can be \nconfigured as 64-bit RAM, as 32-bit  shift registers (SRL32), or as two SRL16s. CLBs in the UltraScale \narchitecture have increased routing and connectivit y compared to CLBs in previous-generation Xilinx \ndevices. They also have additional control signals to enable superior register pa cking, resulting in overall \nhigher device utilization.\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 34\nInterconnect\nVarious length vertical and horizontal routing resources in the UltraScale architecture that span 1, 2, 4, 5, \n12, or 16 CLBs ensure that all signals can be transported from source to destination with ease, providing \nsupport for the next generation of wide data buses to be routed across even the highest capacity devices \nwhile simultaneously improving qualit y of results and software run time.\nBlock RAM\nEvery UltraScale architecture-bas ed device contains a number of 36Kb block RAMs, each with two \ncompletely independent ports that share only the stor ed data. Each block RAM can be configured as one \n36Kb RAM or two independent 18Kb RAMs. Each memory a ccess, read or write, is controlled by the clock. \nConnections in every block RAM column enable signals to be cascad ed between vertically adjacent block \nRAMs, providing an easy method to  create large, fast memory arra ys, and FIFOs with greatly reduced \npower consumption.\nAll inputs, data, address, clock enables, and write enables are registered. The input address is always \nclocked (unless address latching is turned off), retain ing data until the next operat ion. An optional output \ndata pipeline register allows higher clock rates at the cost of an extr a cycle of latency. During a write \noperation, the data output can reflect either the previo usly stored data or the newly written data, or it can \nremain unchanged. Block RAM sites that remain unused  in the user design are automatically powered \ndown to reduce total power consumption. There is an  additional pin on every block RAM to control the \ndynamic power gating feature.\nProgrammable Data Width\nEach port can be configured  as 32K × 1; 16K × 2; 8K × 4; 4K × 9 (or 8); 2K × 18 (or 16); 1K × 36 (or 32); or \n512 × 72 (or 64). Whether configured as block RAM or FIFO, the two ports can have different aspect ratios \nwithout any constraints. Each block RAM can be di vided into two completely independent 18Kb block \nRAMs that can each be configured to any aspect ratio from 16K × 1 to 512 × 36. Everything described \npreviously for the full 36Kb block RA M also applies to each of the sma ller 18Kb block RAMs. Only in simple \ndual-port (SDP) mode can data widths of greater th an 18 bits (18Kb RAM) or 36 bits (36Kb RAM) be \naccessed. In this mode, one port is dedicated to read operation, the other to write operation. In SDP mode, \none side (read or write) can be variable, while the other is fixed to 32/36 or 64/72. Both sides of the \ndual-port 36Kb RAM can be of variable width.\nError Detection and Correction\nEach 64-bit-wide block RAM can ge nerate, store, and utilize eight additional Hamming code bits and \nperform single-bit error correction and double-bit e rror detection (ECC) during the read process. The ECC \nlogic can also be used when wr iting to or reading from external 64- to 72-bit-wide memories.\nFIFO Controller\nEach block RAM can be configured as a 36Kb FIFO or an 18Kb FIFO. The buil t-in FIFO controller for \nsingle-clock (synchronous) or dual-c lock (asynchronous or multirate) operation increments the internal \nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 35\naddresses and provides four handsh aking flags: full, empty, programm able full, and programmable empty. \nThe programmable flags allow the user to specify the FI FO counter values that make these flags go active. \nThe FIFO width and depth are programmable with suppor t for different read port and write port widths on \na single FIFO. A dedicated ca scade path allows for easy creation of deeper FIFOs.\nUltraRAM\nUltraRAM is a high-density, dual-port, synchronous me mory block used in some UltraScale+ families. Both \nof the ports share the same clock and can address all of  the 4K x 72 bits. Each port can independently read \nfrom or write to the memory array. UltraRAM supports  two types of write enable schemes. The first mode \nis consistent with the block RAM byte write enable mode. The second mode allows gating the data and \nparity byte writes separately. Multiple UltraRAM blocks  can be cascaded together to create larger memory \narrays. UltraRAM blocks can be connected together to  create larger memory arrays. Dedicated routing in \nthe UltraRAM column enables the entire column height  to be connected together. This makes UltraRAM an \nideal solution for replacing external memories such  as SRAM. Cascadable anywhere from 288Kb to 36Mb, \nUltraRAM provides the flexibility to fulf ill many different memory requirements.\nError Detection and Correction\nEach 64-bit-wide UltraRAM can generate, store an d utilize eight additional Hamming code bits and \nperform single-bit error correction and double-bit error detection (ECC) during the read process.\nDigital Signal Processing\nDSP applications use many binary multipliers and accumulators, best implem ented in dedicated DSP \nslices. All UltraScale architecture-based devices ha ve many dedicated, low-power DSP slices, combining \nhigh speed with small size while retaining system design flexibility.\nEach DSP slice fundamentally consists of a dedicated 27 × 18 bit twos complement multiplier and a 48-bit \naccumulator. The multiplier can be dynamically bypassed, and two 48-bit inputs can feed a \nsingle-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) arithmetic  unit (dual 24-bit add/subtract/accumulate or quad \n12-bit add/subtract/accumulate), or a logic unit that can generate any one of ten different logic functions \nof the two operands.\nThe DSP includes an additional pre-adder, typically us ed in symmetrical filters.  This pre-adder improves \nperformance in densely packed designs and reduces the DSP slice count by up to 50%. The 96-bit-wide \nXOR function, programmable to 12, 24, 48, or 96-bi t widths, enables performance improvements when \nimplementing forward error correction and cyclic redundancy checking algorithms.\nThe DSP also includes a 48-bit-wide pattern detector  that can be used for convergent or symmetric \nrounding. The pattern detector is also capable of im plementing 96-bit-wide logic functions when used in \nconjunction with the logic unit.\nThe DSP slice provides extensive pipelining and ex tension capabilities that enhance the speed and \nefficiency of many applications beyond digital sign al processing, such as wide dynamic bus shifters, \nmemory address generators, wide bus multiplexe rs, and memory-mapped I/O register files. The \nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 36\naccumulator can also be used as a synchronous up/down counter.\nSystem Monitor\nThe System Monitor blocks in the UltraScale architecture are used to enhance the overall safety, security, \nand reliability of the system by monitoring the physical environment via on-chip power supply and temperature sensors.\nAll UltraScale architecture-based devices contain at  least one System Monitor. The System Monitor in \nUltraScale+ devices is similar to the Kintex UltraScale  and Virtex UltraScale devices but with the addition \nof a PMBus interface.\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs contain one System Monitor in  the PL and an additional block in the PS. The \nSystem Monitor in the PL has the same featur es as the block in UltraScale+ FPGAs. See Table 11 .\nIn FPGAs and the MPSoC PL, sensor outputs and up to 17 user-allocated external analog inputs are \ndigitized using a 10-bit 200 kilo-sample-per-second (kSPS) ADC, and the measur ements are stored in \nregisters that can be accessed via internal FPGA (DRP), JTAG, PMBus, or I2C interfaces. The I2C interface \nand PMBus allow the on-chip monitoring to be easily  accessed by the System Manager/Host before and \nafter device configuration. \nThe System Monitor in the MPSoC PS uses a 10-bit, 1 mega-sample-per-second (MSPS) ADC to digitize the \nsensor inputs. The measurements are stored in registers and are accessed via the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) interface by the processors and the PMU in the PS.Table  11: Key System Monitor Features\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC PL Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC PS\nADC 10-bit 200kSPS 10-bit 1MSPS\nInterfaces JTAG, I2C, DRP, PMBus APB\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 37\nPackaging\nThe UltraScale devices are available in a variety of organic flip-chip, lidless flip-chip, and integrated \nfan-out (InFO) packages supporting different quanti ties of I/Os and transceivers. Maximum supported \nperformance can depend on the style of package and its material. Always refer to the specific device data \nsheet for performance specifications by package type.\nIn flip-chip packages, the silicon device is attached  to the package substrate using a high-performance \nflip-chip process. Decoupling capacitors are mounted  on the package substrate to optimize signal \nintegrity under simultan eous switching of outputs (SSO) conditions.\nInFO packages are small form factor packages that require much less PCB area and are much thinner than \nother packaging types. These packages enable the use of high compute density devices in small \napplications. The elimination of the package substrat e provides excellent thermal and power distribution \nand shorter flight times with improved signal integrity.\nSystem-Level Features\nSeveral functions span both the PS and PL and include:\n\uf0b7Reset Management\n\uf0b7Clock Management\n\uf0b7Power Domains\n\uf0b7PS Boot and Device Configuration\n\uf0b7Hardware and Software Debug Support\nReset Management\nThe reset management function provides the ability to re set the entire device or in dividual units within it. \nThe PS supports these reset functions and signals:\n\uf0b7External and internal power-on reset signal\n\uf0b7Warm reset\n\uf0b7Watchdog timer reset\n\uf0b7User resets to PL\n\uf0b7Software, watchdog timer, or JTAG provided resets\n\uf0b7Security violation reset (locked down reset)\nClock Management\nThe PS in Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs is equipped with fi ve phase-locked loops (PLLs), providing flexibility \nin configuring the clock domains within the PS. There ar e four primary clock domains of interest within the \nPS. These include the APU, the RPU, the DDR controller, and the I/O peripherals (IOP). The frequencies of \nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 38\nall of these domains can be configured  independently under software control.\nPower Domains\nThe Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC contains four separa te power domains. When they are connected to \nseparate power supplies, they can be completely powered down independently of each other without \nconsuming any dynamic or static power. The processing system includes:\n\uf0b7Full Power Domain (FPD)\n\uf0b7Low Power Domain (LPD)\n\uf0b7Battery Powered Domain (BPD)\nIn addition to these three Processing System powe r domains, the PL can also be completely powered \ndown if connected to separate power supplies.\nThe Full Power Domain (FPD) consists  of the following major blocks:\n\uf0b7Application Processing Unit (APU)\n\uf0b7DMA (FP-DMA)\n\uf0b7Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)\n\uf0b7Dynamic Memory Controller (DDRC)\n\uf0b7High-Speed I/O Peripherals\nThe Low Power Domain (LPD) consists of the following major blocks: \n\uf0b7Real-Time Processing Unit (RPU)\n\uf0b7DMA (LP-DMA)\n\uf0b7Platform Management Unit (PMU)\n\uf0b7Configuration Security Unit (CSU)\n\uf0b7Low-Speed I/O Peripherals\n\uf0b7Static Memory Interfaces\nThe Battery Power Domain (BPD) is the lowest power domain of the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC processing \nsystem. In this mode, all the PS is powered off exce pt the Real-Time Clock (RTC) and battery-backed RAM \n(BBRAM). \nPower Examples\nPower for the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs varies dependin g on the utilization of the PL resources, and the \nfrequency of the PS and PL. To estimate powe r, use the Xilinx Power Estimator (XPE) at:\nhttp://www.xilinx.com/products/de sign_tools/logic_design/xpe.htm\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 39\nPS Boot and Device Configuration\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs use a multi-stage boot proc ess that supports both a non-secure and a secure \nboot. The PS is the master of the boot and config uration process. For a secure boot, the AES-GCM, \nSHA-3/384 decrypts and authenticates the images while the 4096-bit RSA block authenticates the image.\nUpon reset, the device mode pins are read to determine the primary boot device to be used: NAND, \nQuad-SPI, SD, eMMC, or JTAG. JTAG can only be used as a non-secure boot sour ce and is intended for \ndebugging purposes. The CSU executes code out of on-chip ROM and copies the first stage boot loader \n(FSBL) from the boot device to the OCM.\nAfter copying the FSBL to OCM, one of the processors , either the Cortex-A53 or Cortex-R5F, executes the \nFSBL. Xilinx supplies example FSBLs or users can create their own. The FSBL initiates the boot of the PS and \ncan load and configure the PL, or configuration of the PL can be deferred to a later stage. The FSBL \ntypically loads either a user applicat ion or an optional second stage bo ot loader (SSBL), such as U-Boot. \nUsers obtain example SSBL from Xilinx or a third pa rty, or they can create their own SSBL. The SSBL \ncontinues the boot process by loading code from any of the primary boot devices or from other sources \nsuch as USB, Ethernet, etc. If the FSBL did not configure the PL, the SSBL can do so, or again, the \nconfiguration can be deferred to a later stage.\nThe static memory interface controll er (NAND, eMMC, or Qu ad-SPI) is configured using default settings. \nTo improve device configuration speed, these settings can be modified by information provided in the boot image header. The ROM boot image is not user readable or callable after boot.\nHardware and Software Debug Support\nThe debug system used in Zynq Ultr aScale+ MPSoCs is based on the A rm CoreSight architecture. It uses \nArm CoreSight components including an embedded tr ace controller (ETC), an embedded trace Macrocell \n(ETM) for each Cortex-A53 and Cortex -R5F processor, and a system trace Macrocell (STM). This enables \nadvanced debug features like event trace, debug breakpoints and triggers, cross-trigger, and debug bus dump to memory. The prog rammable logic can be debugged with  the Xilinx Vivado Logic Analyzer.\nDebug Ports\nThree JTAG ports are available and can be chained together or used separately. When chained together, a \nsingle port is used for chip-level JTAG functions,  Arm processor code downlo ads and run-time control \noperations, PL configuration, and PL debug with the Vi vado Logic Analyzer. This enables tools such as the \nXilinx Software Development Kit (SDK)  and Vivado Logic Analyzer to share a single download cable from \nXilinx.\nWhen the JTAG chain is split, one port is used to directly access the Arm DAP interface. This CoreSight \ninterface enables the use of Arm-compliant debug an d software development tools such as Development \nStudio 5 (DS-5™). The other JTAG port can then be used by the Xilinx FPGA tools for access to the PL, \nincluding configuration bitstream downloads and PL de bug with the Vivado Logic Analyzer. In this mode, \nusers can download to and debug the PL in the same manner as a stand-alone FPGA.\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Data Sheet: Overview\nDS891 (v1.10) November 7, 2022 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 40\nOrdering Information\nTable 12  shows the speed and temperature grades available in the different device families.\nThe ordering information shown in Figure 3  applies to all packages in the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.Table  12: Speed Grade and Temperature Grade\nDevice \nFamilyDevicesSpeed Grade and Temperature Grade\nCommercial \n(C) Extended \n(E) Industrial \n(I) \n0°C to +85°C 0°C to +100°C 0°C  to +110°C –40°C to +100°C\nZynq \nUltraScale+CG \nDevices-2E (0.85V) -2I (0.85V)\n-2LE(1)(2) (0.85V or 0.72V)\n-1E (0.85V) -1I (0.85V)\n-1LI(2) (0.85V or 0.72V)\nZU1EG\nZU2EG\nZU3EG\nZU3TEG-2E (0.85V) -2I (0.85V)\n-2LE(1)(2) (0.85V or 0.72V)\n-1E (0.85V) -1I (0.85V)\n-1LI(2) (0.85V or 0.72V)\nZU4EG\nZU5EGZU6EG\nZU7EG\nZU9EG\nZU11EG\nZU15EG\nZU17EGZU19EG-3E (0.90V)\n-2E (0.85V) -2I (0.85V)\n-2LE(1)(2) (0.85V or 0.72V)\n-1E (0.85V) -1I (0.85V)\n-1LI(2) (0.85V or 0.72V)\nEV \nDevices-3E (0.90V)\n-2E (0.85V) -2I (0.85V)\n-2LE(1)(2) (0.85V or 0.72V)\n-1E (0.85V) -1I (0.85V)\n-1LI(2) (0.85V or 0.72V)\nNotes: \n1.
