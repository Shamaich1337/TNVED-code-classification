#### Description:
The CX7000L X-Ray Counter is an advanced electronic inspection system designed for automatic counting and verification of surface mount devices (SMDs) in various packaging formats. It utilizes X-ray technology to perform non-destructive inspections, ensuring that components are counted accurately without damage. The system is equipped with a high-resolution flat panel detector and operates with a user-friendly interface that allows for one-button operation.

#### Typical Applications:
The CX7000L is primarily used in:
- **Incoming Inspection:** Ensuring that components received from suppliers meet quality standards before they are used in production.
- **Inventory Management:** Keeping track of component quantities and types in stock, facilitating efficient inventory control.
- **Manufacturing Quality Control:** Verifying the accuracy of component counts in production lines, reducing labor costs and improving efficiency.
- **Electronics Assembly:** Suitable for environments where precise counting of small electronic components is critical, such as in the assembly of circuit boards.

This X-ray counter is particularly advantageous for manufacturers looking to streamline their inspection processes while maintaining high standards of accuracy and safety.
