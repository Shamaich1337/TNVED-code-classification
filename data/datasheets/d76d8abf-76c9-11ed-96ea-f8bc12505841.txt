Their on-chip output amplifiers allow the outputs to swing rail-to-rail with a slew rate of 0.7 V/μs. The AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 utilize a versatile 3-wire serial interface that operates at clock \nrates up to 30 MHz and is compatible with standard SPI®, \nQSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP interface standards. \nThe references for the two DACs are derived from two reference \npins (one per DAC). The reference inputs can be configured as \nbuffered or unbuffered inputs. The outputs of both DACs can be \nupdated simultaneously using the asynchronous LDAC\n input. \nThe parts incorporate a power-on reset circuit, which ensures \nthat the DAC outputs power-up to 0 V and remain there until a valid write takes place to the device. The parts contain a power-down feature that reduces the current consumption of the devices to 200 nA at 5 V (50 nA at 3 V) and provides software-selectable output loads while in power-down mode. \nThe low power consumption of these parts in normal operation \nmakes them ideally suited for portable battery-operated equipment. The power consumption is 1.5 mW at 5 V , 0.7 mW \nat 3 V , reducing to 1 μW in power-down mode. \n \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM \nDAC\nREGISTERRESISTOR\nNETWORKPOWER-DOWN\nLOGIC\nRESISTOR\nNETWORKBUFFERSTRING\nDAC\nSTRING\nDACAD5302/AD5312/AD5322\nINPUT\nREGISTER\nINPUT\nREGISTERDAC\nREGISTER\nINTERFACE\nLOGICSCLKPOWER-ON\nRESETVDD VREFA\nVOUTA VOUTA\nVOUTB VOUTB\nGND VREFB LDACDIN\n00928-001SYNCBUFFER\n \nFigure 1. \n \nAD5302/AD5312/AD5322 \n \nRev.

Pin Configuration \nTable 5. Pin Function Descriptions \nPin No. Mnemonic Description \n1  LDAC   Active Low Control Input. This pin transfers the contents of the input registers to their respective DAC registers. \nPulsing LDAC  low allows either or both DAC registers to be updated if the input registers have new data. This \nallows simultaneous updating of both DAC outputs.  \n2  VDD  Power Supply Input. The parts can be operated from 2.5 V to 5.5 V, and the supply should be decoupled to GND.  \n3 V REFB  Reference Input Pin for DAC B. This is the reference for DAC B. It can be configured as a buffered or an \nunbuffered input, depending on the BUF bit in the contro l word of DAC B. It has an input range of 0 V to V DD in \nunbuffered mode and 1 V to V DD in buffered mode.  \n4 V REFA  Reference Input Pin for DAC A. This is the reference for DAC A. It can be configured as a buffered or an \nunbuffered input depending on the BUF bit in the control word of DAC A. It has an input range of 0 V to V DD in \nunbuffered mode and 1 V to V DD in buffered mode.  \n5 V OUTA  Buffered Analog Output Voltage from DAC A. The output amplifier has rail-to-rail operation.  \n6 V OUTB  Buffered Analog Output Voltage from DAC B. The output amplifier has rail-to-rail operation.  \n7 SYNC  Active Low Control Input. This is the frame synchronization signal for the input data. When SYNC  goes low, it \npowers on the SCLK and DIN buffers and enables the input shift register. Data is transferred in on the falling \nedges of the following 16 clocks. If SYNC  is taken high before the 16th falling edge, the rising edge of SYNC  acts \nas an interrupt and the write sequ ence is ignored by the device.  \n8 SCLK  Serial Clock Input. Data is clocked into  the input shift register on the falling edge of the serial clock input. Data \ncan be transferred at rates up to 30 MHz. The SCLK input buffer is powered down after each write cycle.  \n9 DIN  Serial Data Input. This device has a 16-bit input shift re gister. Data is clocked into the register on the falling \nedge of the serial clock input. The DIN input bu ffer is powered down after each write cycle.  \n10 GND  Ground Reference Point for All Circuitry on the Part.  \n \n AD5302/AD5312/AD5322\n \nRev. D | Page 9 of 24 TERMINOLOGY \nRelative Accuracy \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity (INL) is \na measure of the maximum deviation, in LSB, from a straight line passing through the actual endpoints of the DAC transfer \nfunction. A typical INL vs. code plot can be seen in Figure 6 . \nDifferential Nonlinearity \nDifferential nonlinearity (DNL) is the difference between the \nmeasured change and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB \nmaximum ensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteed \nmonotonic by design. A typical DNL vs. code plot can be seen \nin Figure 9 . \nOffset Error \nThis is a measure of the offset error of the DAC and the output \namplifier. It is expressed as a percentage of the full-scale range. \nGain Error \nThis is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the \ndeviation in slope of the actual DAC transfer characteristic from \nthe ideal expressed as a percentage of the full-scale range. \nOffset Error Drift \nThis is a measure of the change in offset error with changes in \ntemperature. It is expressed in (ppm of full-scale range)/°C. \nGain Error Drift \nThis is a measure of the change in gain error with changes in temperature. It is expressed in (ppm of full-scale range)/°C. \nMajor-Code Transition Glitch Energy \nMajor-code transition glitch energy is the energy of the impulse \ninjected into the analog output when the code in the DAC \nregister changes state. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in nV-sec and is measured when the digital code is changed by 1 LSB at the major carry transition (011 . . . 11 to \n100 . . . 00 or 100 . . . 00 to 011 . . . 11). \nDigital Feedthrough \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into \nthe analog output of the DAC from the digital input pins of the device, but is measured when the DAC is not being written to \n(SYNC\n held high). It is specified in nV-sec and is measured \nwith a full-scale change on the digital input pins, that is, from \nall 0s to all 1s and vice versa. \nAnalog Crosstalk \nThis is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one DAC \ndue to a change in the output of the other DAC. It is measured \nby loading one of the input registers with a full-scale code change (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa) while keeping LDAC  \nhigh, then pulsing LDAC  low, and monitoring the output of the \nDAC whose digital code is not changed. The area of the glitch is \nexpressed in nV-sec. \nDAC-to-DAC Crosstalk \nThis is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one DAC \ndue to a digital code change and subsequent output change of \nthe other DAC. This includes both digital and analog crosstalk. It is measured by loading one of the DACs with a full-scale code \nchange (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa) while keeping LDAC\n low \nand monitoring the output of the other DAC. The area of the \nglitch is expressed in nV-sec. \nDC Crosstalk \nThis is the dc change in the output level of one DAC in response \nto a change in the output of the other DAC. It is measured with a full-scale output change on one DAC while monitoring the \nother DAC. It is expressed in μV . \nPower Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) \nThis indicates how the output of the DAC is affected by changes \nin the supply voltage. PSRR is the ratio of the change in V\nOUT to \na change in V DD for full-scale output of the DAC. It is measured \nin dB. V REF is held at 2 V and V DD is varied ±10%. \nReference Feedthrough This is the ratio of the amplitude of the signal at the DAC \noutput to the reference input when the DAC output is not being \nupdated (that is, LDAC\n is high). It is expressed in dB. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD) \nThis is the difference between an ideal sine wave and its \nattenuated version using the DAC. The sine wave is used as the \nreference for the DAC and the THD is a measure of the \nharmonics present on the DAC output. It is measured in dB. \nMultiplying Bandwidth \nThe amplifiers within the DAC have a finite bandwidth. The \nmultiplying bandwidth is a measure of this. A sine wave on the \nreference (with full-scale code loaded to the DAC) appears on the output. The multiplying bandwidth is the frequency at \nwhich the output amplitude falls to 3 dB below the input. \nChannel-to-Channel Isolation Definition \nThis is a ratio of the amplitude of the signal at the output of one \nDAC to a sine wave on the reference input of the other DAC. It \nis measured in dB. \nAD5302/AD5312/AD5322 \n \nRev.

D | Page 14 of 24 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 are dual resistor-string DACs \nfabricated on a CMOS process with resolutions of 8, 10, and 12 \nbits, respectively. They contain reference buffers and output buffer amplifiers, and are written to via a 3-wire serial interface. They operate from single supplies of 2.5 V to 5.5 V , and the output buffer amplifiers provide rail-to-rail output swing with a \nslew rate of 0.7 V/μs. Each DAC is provided with a separate \nreference input, which can be buffered to draw virtually no current from the reference source, or unbuffered to give a reference input range from GND to V\nDD. The devices have three \nprogrammable power-down modes, in which one or both DACs \ncan be turned off completely with a high impedance output, or \nthe output can be pulled low by an on-chip resistor. \nDIGITAL-TO-ANALOG SECTION \nThe architecture of one DAC channel consists of a reference \nbuffer and a resistor-string DAC followed by an output buffer \namplifier. The voltage at the V REF pin provides the reference \nvoltage for the DAC. Figure 28  shows a block diagram of the \nDAC architecture. Because the input coding to the DAC is \nstraight binary, the ideal output voltage is given by \nNREF\nOUTD VV2×=  \nwhere: \nD = decimal equivalent of the binary code that is loaded to the \nDAC register: \n0 to 255 for AD5302 (8 bits) \n0 to 1023 for AD5312 (10 bits) \n0 to 4095 for AD5322 (12 bits) \nN = DAC resolution. \nINPUT\nREGISTERDAC\nREGISTERRESISTOR\nSTRING\nOUTPUT BUFFER\nAMPLIFIERREFERENCE\nBUFFERSWITCH\nCONTROLLEDBY CONTROLLOGICVREFA\nVOUTA00928-028 \nFigure 28. Single DAC Channel Architecture \nRESISTOR STRING \nThe resistor-string section is shown in Figure 29 . It is simply a \nstring of resistors, each of value R. The digital code loaded to \nthe DAC register determines at what node on the string the \nvoltage is tapped off to be fed into the output amplifier. The voltage is tapped off by closing one of the switches connecting the string to the amplifier. Because it is a string of resistors, it is \nguaranteed monotonic.

The \nreference inputs are buffered but can also be configured as \nunbuffered. The advantage of the buffered input is the high impedance it presents to the voltage source driving it. \nHowever, if the unbuffered mode is used, the user can have a \nreference voltage as low as GND and as high as V\nDD because \nthere is no restriction due to headroom and footroom of the reference amplifier. If there is a buffered reference in the circuit \n(for example, REF192), there is no need to use the on-chip buffers of the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322. In unbuffered mode, \nthe impedance is still large (180 kΩ per reference input). \nThe buffered/unbuffered option is controlled by the BUF bit in \nthe control word (see the Serial Interface  section for a \ndescription of the register contents). \nOUTPUT AMPLIFIER \nThe output buffer amplifier is capable of generating output voltages to within 1 mV of either rail, which gives an output \nrange of 0.001 V to V\nDD – 0.001 V when the reference is V DD.  \nIt is capable of driving a load of 2 kΩ in parallel with 500 pF to \nGND and V DD. The source and sink capabilities of the output \namplifier can be seen in Figure 16 . \nThe slew rate is 0.7 V/μs with a half-scale settling time to \n±0.5 LSB (at eight bits) of 6 μs. See Figure 21 . \nPOWER-ON RESET \nThe AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 are provided with a power-on \nreset function to power them up in a defined state. The power-\non state is \n• Normal operation \n• Reference inputs unbuffered \n• Output voltage set to 0 V \nBoth input and DAC registers are filled with zeros and remain \nso until a valid write sequence is made to the device. This is particularly useful in applications where it is important to know \nthe state of the DAC outputs while the device is powering up. \n AD5302/AD5312/AD5322\n \nRev. D | Page 15 of 24 SERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 are controlled over a versatile, \n3-wire serial interface, which operates at clock rates up to 30 MHz \nand is compatible with SPI, QSPI, MICROWIRE, and DSP \ninterface standards. \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER \nThe input shift register is 16 bits wide (see Figure 30  to Figure 32 ). \nData is loaded into the device as a 16-bit word under the control \nof a serial clock input, SCLK. The timing diagram for this operation is shown in Figure 2 . The 16-bit word consists of four \ncontrol bits followed by 8, 10, or 12 bits of DAC data, depending on the device type. The first bit loaded is the MSB (Bit 15), \nwhich determines whether the data is for DAC A or DAC B.  \nBit 14 determines if the reference input is buffered or unbuffered. \nBit 13 and Bit 12 control the operating mode of the DAC.  \nTable 6.

AD5322 Input Shift Register Contents \nThe remaining bits are DAC data bits, starting with the MSB and \nending with the LSB. The AD5322 uses all 12 bits of DAC data, \nthe AD5312 uses 10 bits and ignores the 2 LSB. The AD5302 uses \neight bits and ignores the last four bits. The data format is straight \nbinary, with all 0s corresponding to 0 V output, and all 1s \ncorresponding to full-scale output (VREF – 1 LSB). \nThe SYNC  input is a level-triggered input that acts as a frame \nsynchronization signal and chip enable. Data can only be \ntransferred into the device while SYNC  is low. To start the serial \ndata transfer, SYNC  should be taken low observing the minimum \nSYNC  to SCLK active edge setup time, t 4. After SYNC  goes low, \nserial data is shifted into the device’s input shift register on the falling edges of SCLK for 16 clock pulses. Any data and clock \npulses after the 16th are ignored, and no further serial data \ntransfers occur until SYNC  is taken high and low again. \nSYNC  can be taken high after the falling edge of the 16th SCLK \npulse, observing the minimum SCLK falling edge to SYNC  \nrising edge time, t 7. \nAfter the end of serial data transfer, data is automatically \ntransferred from the input shift register to the input register of \nthe selected DAC. If SYNC  is taken high before the 16th falling \nedge of SCLK, the data transfer is aborted and the input \nregisters are not updated. \nWhen data has been transferred into both input registers, the \nDAC registers of both DACs can be simultaneously updated by \ntaking LDAC  low. \nLOW POWER SERIAL INTERFACE \nTo reduce the power consumption of the device even further, \nthe interface only powers up fully when the device is being \nwritten to. As soon as the 16-bit control word has been written to the part, the SCLK and DIN input buffers are powered down. \nThey only power up again following a falling edge of SYNC\n. \nDOUBLE-BUFFERED INTERFACE \nThe AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 DACs all have double-buffered \ninterfaces consisting of two banks of registers—input registers and \nDAC registers. The input register is connected directly to the input shift register and the digital code is transferred to the relevant input register on completion of a valid write sequence. The DAC register contains the digital code used by the resistor string. \nAccess to the DAC register is controlled by the LDAC\n function. \nWhen LDAC  is high, the DAC register is latched and the input \nregister can change state without affecting the contents of the \nDAC register. However, when LDAC  is brought low, the DAC \nregister becomes transparent and the contents of the input \nregister are transferred to it. \nThis is useful if the user requires simultaneous updating of both \nDAC outputs. The user can write to both input registers \nindividually and then, by pulsing the LDAC  input low, both \noutputs update simultaneously. \nThese parts contain an extra feature whereby the DAC register \nis not updated unless its input register has been updated since \nthe last time that LDAC  was brought low. Normally, when \nLDAC  is brought low, the DAC registers are filled with the \ncontents of the input registers. In the case of the AD5302/ \nAD5312/AD5322, the part only updates the DAC register if  \nthe input register has been changed since the last time the  DAC register was updated, thereby removing unnecessary \ndigital crosstalk. \nAD5302/AD5312/AD5322 \n \nRev. D | Page 16 of 24 POWER-DOWN MODES \nThe AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 have very low power consump-\ntion, dissipating only 0.7 mW with a 3 V supply and 1.5 mW \nwith a 5 V supply. Power consumption can be further reduced when the DACs are not in use by putting them into one of three power-down modes, which are selected by Bit 13 and Bit 12 (PD1 and PD0) of the control word. Table 7  shows how the  \nstate of the bits corresponds to the mode of operation of that \nparticular DAC. \nTable 7. PD1/PD0 Operating Modes \nPD1 PDO Operating Mode \n0 0 Normal Operation \n0  1  Power-Down (1 kΩ Load to GND)  \n1  0  Power-Down (100 kΩ Load to GND)  \n1  1  Power-Down (High Impedance Output)  \nWhen both bits are set to 0, the DACs work normally with  \ntheir normal power consumption of 300 μA at 5 V . However,  \nfor the three power-down modes, the supply current falls to 200 nA at 5 V (50 nA at 3 V). Not only does the supply current drop, but the output stage is also internally switched from the \noutput of the amplifier to a resistor network of known values. \nThis has the advantage that the output impedance of the part is known while the part is in power-down mode and provides a defined input condition for whatever is connected to the output \nof the DAC amplifier. There are three different options.  • The output is connected internally to GND through a  \n1 kΩ resistor, \n• The output is connected internally to GND through a \n100 kΩ resistor, or \n• The output is left open-circuited (three-state).  \nThe output stage is illustrated in Figure 33 . \nThe bias generator, the output amplifier, the resistor string,  \nand all other associated linear circuitry are shut down when  \nthe power-down mode is activated. However, the contents of  the registers are unaffected when in power-down. The time to \nexit power-down is typically 2.5 μs for V\nDD = 5 V and 5 μs when \nVDD = 3 V .

The ADSP-2101/ADSP-\n2103  should be set up to operate in the SPORT transmit alternate \nframing mode. The  ADSP-2101/ADSP-2103  sport is programmed \nthrough the SPORT control register and should be configured \nas follows: internal clock operation, active low framing, 16-bit \nword length. Transmission is initiated by writing a word to the \nTx register after the SPORT has been enabled. The data is clocked \nout on each falling edge of the DSP’s serial clock and clocked into \nthe AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 on the rising edge of the DSP’s serial \nclock. This corresponds to the falling edge of the DAC’s SCLK. \nSCLKDINSYNC TFS\nDT\nSCLK\n1ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY\n00928-034AD5302/\nAD5312/\nAD53221ADSP-2101/\nADSP-21031\n \nFigure 34.

SCK of the \n68HC11/68L11 drives the SCLK of the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322, while the MOSI output drives the serial data line of the DAC. \nThe SYNC\n signal is derived from a port line (PC7). The setup \nconditions for correct operation of this interface are as follows: \nthe 68HC11/68L11 should be configured so that its CPOL bit = 0 \nand its CPHA bit = 1. When data is being transmitted to the \nDAC, the SYNC  line is taken low (PC7). When the 68HC11/ \n68L11 are configured as above, data appearing on the MOSI \noutput is valid on the falling edge of SCK. Serial data from the 68HC11/ 68L11 is transmitted in 8-bit bytes with only eight falling clock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. Data is \ntransmitted MSB first. In order to load data to the \nAD5302/AD5312/AD5322, PC7 is left low after the first eight bits are transferred and a second serial write operation is performed to the DAC; PC7 is taken high at the end of this \nprocedure. \nDINSCLKSYNC PC7\nSCK\nMOSI68HC11/68L111\n1ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY 00928-035AD5302/\nAD5312/\nAD53221\n \nFigure 35.

The setup for \nthe interface is as follows: TXD of the 80C51/80L51 drives \nSCLK of the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322, while RXD drives the \nserial data line of the part. The SYNC  signal is again derived \nfrom a bit programmable pin on the port. In this case, port line \nP3.3 is used. When data is to be transmitted to the AD5302/ AD5312/AD5322, P3.3 is taken low. The 80C51/80L51 transmit data in 8-bit bytes only; thus only eight falling clock edges occur in the transmit cycle. To load data to the DAC, P3.3 is left low \nafter the first eight bits are transmitted, and a second write cycle \nis initiated to transmit the second byte of data. P3.3 is taken high following the completion of this cycle. The 80C51/80L51 \noutput the serial data in a format that has the LSB first.

D | Page 18 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nTYPICAL APPLICATION CIRCUIT \nThe AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 can be used with a wide range \nof reference voltages, especially if the reference inputs are \nconfigured to be unbuffered, in which case the devices offer full, one-quadrant multiplying capability over a reference range of \n0 V to V\nDD. More typically, the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 can \nbe used with a fixed, precision reference voltage. Figure 38  \nshows a typical setup for the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322  \nwhen using an external reference. If the reference inputs are unbuffered, the reference input range is from 0 V to V\nDD, but if \nthe on-chip reference buffers are used, the reference range is \nreduced. Suitable references for 5 V operation are the AD780 \nand REF192 (2.5 V references). For 2.5 V operation, a suitable \nexternal reference would be the REF191, a 2.048 V reference. \nSCLK\nDIN\nGNDAD5302/AD5312/\nAD5322\nSERIAL\nINTERFACEEXT\nREF\n00928-038AD780/REF192\nWITH VDD = 5V\nOR REF191 WITHV\nDD = 2.5VVOUT\nSYNCVOUTA\nVOUTBVREFA\nVREFB 1µFVDD = 2.5V to 5.5 V\nVDD\n \nFigure 38. AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 Using External Reference \nIf an output range of 0 V to V DD is required when the reference \ninputs are configured as unbuffered (for example, 0 V to 5 V), \nthe simplest solution is to connect the reference inputs to V DD. \nAs this supply cannot be very accurate and can be noisy, the \nAD5302/AD5312/AD5322 can be powered from the reference \nvoltage, for example, a 5 V reference such as the REF195, as shown in Figure 39 . The REF195 outputs a steady supply \nvoltage for the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322. The current required from the REF195 is 300 μA supply current and approximately 30 μA into each reference input. This is with no load on the \nDAC outputs. When the DAC outputs are loaded, the REF195 \nalso needs to supply the current to the loads.

Due to noise, safety \nrequirements, or distance, it can be necessary to isolate the \nAD5302/AD5312/AD5322 from the controller. This can easily be achieved by using opto-isolators, which provide isolation in excess of 3 kV . The serial loading structure of the AD5302/ AD5312/AD5322 makes them ideally suited for use in opto-\nisolated applications. Figure 41  shows an opto-isolated interface \nto the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 where DIN, SCLK, and SYNC\n \nare driven from opto-couplers. The power supply to the part \nalso needs to be isolated by using a transformer. On the DAC side of the transformer, a 5 V regulator provides the 5 V supply \nrequired for the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322. \nSCLK\nDINAD5302/AD5312/\nAD5322\n00928-041SYNC\nGND5V\nREGULATOR\nPOWER\nVDD10µF 0.1µF\nVOUTA\nVOUTBVREFBVREFAVDD\n10kΩ\n10kΩ\n10kΩ\nDINSYNCSCLK\nVDD\nVDD\n \nFigure 41.

In this application, \nall the DACs in the system receive the same serial clock and serial \ndata, but only the SYNC  to one of the devices is active at any one \ntime, allowing access to two channels in this eight-channel system.  \n The 74HC139 is used as a 2-to-4 line decoder to address any of \nthe DACs in the system. To prevent timing errors from occurring, \nthe enable input should be brought to its inactive state while the coded address inputs are changing state.

DAC A is used to provide the coarse \nadjustment while DAC B provides the fine adjustment. Varying the ratio of R1 and R2 changes the relative effect of the coarse and fine adjustments. With the resistor values and external \nreference shown, the output amplifier has unity gain for the \nDAC A output, so the output range is 0 V to 2.5 V − 1 LSB. For \nDAC B, the amplifier has a gain of 7.6 × 10\n–3, giving DAC B a \nrange equal to 19 mV . \nThe circuit is shown with a 2.5 V reference, but reference \nvoltages up to V DD can be used.

Coarse/Fine Adjustment \n \n POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING AND GROUNDING \nIn any circuit where accuracy is important, careful considera-\ntion of the power supply and ground return layout helps to \nensure the rated performance. The printed circuit board on which the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 is mounted should be \ndesigned so that the analog and digital sections are separated \nand confined to certain areas of the board. If the AD5302/ AD5312/AD5322 are in a system where multiple devices require an AGND-to-DGND connection, the connection should be made at one point only. The star ground point should be established as close as possible to the AD5302/AD5312/ \nAD5322. The part should have ample supply bypassing of 10 μF \nin parallel with 0.1 μF on the supply located as close as possible to the package, ideally right up against the device. The 10 μF capacitors are the tantalum bead type. The 0.1 μF capacitor should have low effective series resistance (ESR) and effective \nseries inductance (ESI), similar to the common ceramic types \nthat provide a low impedance path to ground at high frequencies \nthat handle transient currents due to internal logic switching. \nThe power supply lines of the AD5302/AD5312/AD5322 \nshould use as large a trace as possible to provide low impedance \npaths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals such as clocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other parts of the board, and should never be run near the reference inputs. Avoid crossover \nof digital and analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the \nboard should run at right angles to each other. This reduces the \neffects of feedthrough through the board. A microstrip technique \nis by far the best, but is not always possible with a double-sided board. In this technique, the component side of the board is dedi-cated to ground while signal traces are placed on the solder side. \n AD5302/AD5312/AD5322\n \nRev.
