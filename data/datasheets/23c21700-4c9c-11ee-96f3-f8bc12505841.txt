The device reduces external component count by fully \nintegrating  an MTP memory , and an  integrated clock circuit which requires no external crystal.   It has \nbeen designed to operate efficiently with USB host controller s by using as little bandwidth as possible \nwhen compared to the total USB bandwidth available . \n \n4.1 Key Features  \n \nFunctional Inte gration. Fully integrated MTP memory , clock generation, AVCC filtering, Power -On-\nReset ( POR) and LDO regulator s. \n \nConfigurable CBUS I/O Pin Options. The fully integrated MTP memory  allows configuration of the \nControl Bus (CBUS) functionality and drive stre ngth selection.  There is one CBUS I/O pin CBUS0 . The  \nconfigurable options of CBUS0 are detailed in Section  3.2. \n \nThe CBUS line  can be configured with any one of these output options by setting bits in the internal MTP \nmemory . The device is s hipped  with the most commonly used pin definitions pre -programmed - see \nSection 8 for details.  \n \nAsynchronous Bit Bang Mode with RD# and WR# Strobes. The FT234XD  supports FTDI’s previous \nchip generation bit -bang mode. In bit -bang mode, the four UART lines can be switched from the regular \ninterface mode to a 4-bit general purpose I/O port. Data packets can be sent to the device and they will \nbe sequentially sent to  the interface at a rate controlled by an internal timer (equivalent to the baud rate \npre-scalar ). Either t he internal RD# or the internal WR# strobe signal  can mapped to the CBU S0 pin  \n(only one CBUS pin available)  which can be used to allow external logic  to be clocked by access to the \nbit-bang I/O bus. This option will be described more fully in a separate application note available from \nFTDI website  (www.ftdichip.com ). \n \nSynchronous Bit Bang Mode. The FT234XD  supports synchronous bit bang mode. This mode differs \nfrom asynchronous bit bang mode in that the interface pins are only read when the device is written to. \nThis makes it easier for the controlling program to measure  the response to an output stimulus as the \ndata returned is synchronous to the output data. An application note, AN232R -01 describes this feature.  \n \nSource Power  and Power Consumption . The FT234XD  is capable of operating at a voltage supply \nbetween + 3.3V and +5 .25V with a nominal operational mode current of 8mA and a nominal USB suspend \nmode current of 125µA. This allows greater margin for peripheral designs to meet the USB suspend mode \ncurrent limit of 2.5mA . An integrated level converter within the UART interface allows the FT234XD  to \ninterface to UART logic running at +1.8V to +3.3V (5V tol erant ). \n \n4.2 Functional Block Descriptions  \n \nThe following paragraphs detail each function within the FT234XD . Please refer to the block diagram \nshown in Figure 2.1. \n \nInternal MTP Memory . The internal MTP memory  in the FT234XD  is used to store USB Vendor ID (VID), \nProduct ID (PID), device serial number, product description string and various other USB configuration \ndescriptors. The internal MTP memory  is also used to configure the CBUS pin functions. The FT234XD  is \nsupplied wit h the internal MTP memory  pre-programmed as described in Section  8.  A user area of the \ninternal MTP memory  is available to system designers to allow storing additional data  from the user \napplication over USB . The internal MTP memory  descriptors can be programmed in circuit, over USB \nwithout any additional voltage requirement. The descriptors can be programmed using the FTDI utility \nsoftware called FT_PROG , which can be downloaded from FTDI Utilities  on the FTDI website  \n(www.ftdichip.com ). \n \n+3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3V LDO regulator generates the +3.3V reference voltage for driving the \nUSB transceiver cell output buffers. It req uires an external decoupling capacitor to be attached to the  \n3V3OUT regulator output pin. It also provides +3.3V power to the 1.5kΩ internal pull up resistor on \nUSBDP. The main function of the LDO is to power the USB Transceiver and the Reset Generator Cel ls \nrather than to power external logic. However, it can be used to supply external circuitry requiring a \n+3.3V nominal supply with a maximum current of 50mA.  \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  10 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n \n+1.8 V LDO Regulator. The + 1.8V LDO regulator generates the + 1.8V reference voltage for internal  use \ndriving the IC core functions of the serial interface engine and USB protocol engine.  \n \nUSB Transceiver. The USB Transceiver Cell provides the USB 1.1 / USB 2.0 full -speed physical interface \nto the USB cable. The output drivers provide +3.3V level slew  rate control signalling, whilst a differential \ninput receiver and two single ended input receivers provide USB data in, Single -Ended -0 (SE0) and USB \nreset detection conditions respectfully. This function also incorporates a 1.5kΩ pull up resistor on USBDP . \nThe block also detects when connected to a USB power supply  which will not enumerate the device but \nstill supply power  and may be used for battery charging . \n \nUSB DPLL. The USB DPLL cell locks on to the incoming NRZI USB data and generates recovered clock  \nand data signals for the Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block.  \n \nInternal 12MHz Oscillator - The Internal 12MHz Oscillator cell generates a 12MHz reference clock. This \nprovides an input to the x4 Clock Multiplier function. The 12MHz Oscillator is also used as the reference \nclock for the SIE, USB Protocol Engine and UART FIFO controller blocks.  \n \nClock Multiplier / Divider. The Clock Multiplier / Divider takes the 12MHz input from the Internal \nOscillator function and generates the 48MHz, 24MHz, 12MHz and 6MHz reference clock signals. The 48Mz \nclock reference is used by the USB DPLL and the Baud Rate Generator blocks.  \n \nSerial Interface Engine (SIE). The Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block performs the parallel to serial \nand serial to parallel conversion of the U SB data. In accordance with the USB 2.0 specification, it \nperforms bit stuffing/un -stuffing and CRC5/CRC16 generation. It also verifies the CRC on the USB data \nstream.  \n \nUSB Protocol Engine. The USB Protocol Engine manages the data stream from the device US B control \nendpoint. It handles the low level USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the \ncommands for controlling the functional parameters of the UART in accordance with the USB 2.0 \nspecification chapter 9.  \n \nFIFO R X Buffer (512  bytes). Data sent from the USB host controller to the UART via the USB data OUT \nendpoint is stored in the FIFO RX (receive) buffer. Data is removed from the buffer to the UART transmit \nregister under control of the UART FIFO controller.  (Rx relative to the USB  interface).  \n \nFIFO TX Buffer (512  bytes). Data from the UART receive register is stored in the T X buffer . The USB \nhost controller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB request for data from the device \ndata IN endpoint.  (Tx relative to the U SB interface).  \n \nUART FIFO Controller. The UART FIFO controller handles the transfer of data between the FIFO RX and \nTX buffers and the UART transmit and receive registers.  \n \nUART Controller with Programmable Signal Inversion and High Drive. Together with th e UART \nFIFO Controller the UART Controller handles the transfer of data between the FIFO RX and FIFO TX \nbuffers and the UART transmit and receive registers. It performs asynchronous 7 or 8 bit parallel to serial \nand serial to parallel conversion of the dat a on the RS232 (or RS422 or RS485) interface.  \n \nControl signals supported by UART mode include RTS, CTS. The UART Controller also provides a \ntransmitter enable control signal pin option ( TXDEN ) to assist with interfacing to RS485 transceivers. \nRTS/CTS and XON / XOFF handshaking options are also supported. Handshaking is handled in hardware to \nensure fast response times. The UART interface also supports the RS232 BREAK setting and detection \nconditions.  \n \nAdditionally, the UART signals can each be individuall y inverted and have a configurable high drive \nstrength capability  (using FT_PROG) . Both these features are configurable in the MTP memory .  \n \nBaud Rate Generator - The Baud Rate Generator provides a 16x clock input to the UART Controller \nfrom the 48MHz refe rence clock. It consists of a 14 bit pre -scalar  and 3 register bits which provide fine \ntuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction or “sub -integer”). This determines the \nbaud rate of the UART, which is programmable from 183 baud to 3 Mbaud.  \n \nThe FT234XD  supports all standard baud rates and non -standard baud rates from 183 Baud up to 3 \nMbaud. Achievable non -standard baud rates are calculated as follows - \nBaud Rate = 3000000 / (n + x) \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  11 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n \nWhere  ‘n’ can be any integer between 2 and 16,384 (= 214 ) and ‘ x’ can be a sub -integer of the value 0, \n0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, or 0.875. When n = 1, x = 0, i.e. baud rate divisors with values \nbetween 1 and 2 are not possible.  \n \nThis gives achievab le baud rates in the range 183.1 baud to 3,000,000 baud.

A USB bus \npowered device gets its power from the USB bus. Basic rules for USB bus power devices are as follows – \n \ni) On plug -in to USB, the device should draw no more current than 100mA.  \nii) In USB Suspend mode the device should draw no more than 2.5mA . \niii) A bus powered high power USB device (one that dr aws more than 100mA) should use the \nCBUS pin  configured as PWREN# and use it to keep the current below 100mA on plug -in and \n2.5mA  on USB suspend.  \niv) A device that consu mes more than 100mA cannot be plugged into a USB bus powered hub.  \nv) No device can draw more than 500mA from the USB bus.  \n \nThe power descriptors in the internal MTP memory  of the FT234XD  should be programmed to match the \ncurrent drawn by the device.  \n \nA ferrit e bead is connected in series with the USB power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT234XD  \nand associated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host. The value of the Ferrite \nBead depends on the total current drawn by the application. A suitable range of Ferrite Beads is available \nfrom Laird Technologies (http://www.lairdtech.com ) for example Laird Technologies Part # \nMI0805K 601R-10. \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  17 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n6.2 Self Powered Configuration  \n \nFT234XD1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nSHIELD\nGND\nGNDVCC\nGNDVCC\n3V3OUTUSBDM\nUSBDP\nVCCIOVCC(3.3-5.25V)\nAGND\nGNDRESET#\n100nF100nF 100nF\n4.7uF+GND4k7\n10k27R27R\nGND47pF 47pF\nVBUS_SENSE\n \nFigure 6.2 Self-Powered  Configuration  \n \nFigure 6.2 illustrates the FT234XD  in a typical USB self-powered  configuration. A USB self-powered  \ndevice gets its power from its own power supply, VCC, and does not draw current from the USB bus. The \nbasic rules for USB self-powered  devices are as follows – \n \ni) A self-powered  device should not force current down the USB bus when t he USB host or hub \ncontroller is powered down.  \nii) A self-powered  device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation and USB \nsuspend as it has its own power supply.  \niii) A self-powered  device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self-powered  \nUSB hub.  \n \nThe power descriptor in the internal MTP memory  of the FT234XD  should be programmed to a value of \nzero ( self-powered ). \n \nIn order to comply with the first requirement above, the USB bus  power (pin 1) is used to control  the \nVBUS_Sense pin of the FT2234 XD device. When the USB host or hub is powered up an internal 1.5kΩ \nresistor on USBDP is pulled up to +3.3V, thus identifying the device as a full speed device to the USB \nhost or hub. When t he USB host or hub is powered off, VBUS_Sen se pin will be low and the FT234 XD is \nheld in a suspend state. In this state the internal 1.5kΩ resistor is not pulled up to any power supply (hub \nor host is powered down), so no current flows down USBDP via the 1 .5kΩ pull -up resistor. Failure to do \nthis may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up erratically.  \n \nFigure 6.2 illustrates a self-powered  design which has a + 3.3V to +5 .25V supply.  \n \nNote:  \n \nWhen the FT234XD  is in reset, the UART interface I/O pins are tri -stated. Input pins have internal 75kΩ \npull-up resistors to VCCIO, so they will gently pull high unless driven by some external logic.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  18 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n \n6.3 USB Bus Powered with Power Switching Configuration  \n \nFT234XD1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nSHIELDFerrite\nBead\nGND\nGNDVCC\nGNDVCC\n3V3OUTUSBDM\nUSBDP\nVCCIO\nAGND\nGNDRESET#\n100nF\n100nF10nF\n4.7uF +CBUS0PWREN#100k\n1kSwitched 5V Power to \nExternal Logic\n0.1uF 0.1uFP Channel Power \nMOSFET\n27R27R\nGND47pF 47pF\n \nFigure 6.3 Bus Powered with Power Switching Configuration  \n \nA requirement of USB bus powered applications, is when in USB suspend mode, the application draws a \ntotal current of less than 2.5mA . This requirement includes external logic. Some external logic has the \nability to power itself down into a low current stat e by monitoring the PWREN# signal. For external logic \nthat cannot power itself down in this way, the FT234XD  provides a simple but effective method of turning \noff power during the USB suspend mode.  \n \nFigure 6.3 shows an example of using a discrete P -Channel MOSFET to control the power to external \nlogic. A suitable device to do this is an International Rectifier (www.irf.com) IRLML6402, or equivalent. It \nis recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1kΩ series resistor and a 0.1μF capacitor is used \nto limit the current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit it is possible that the \ntransient power surge, caused when the M OSFET switches on, will reset the FT234XD  or the USB \nhost/hub controller. The soft start circuit example shown in Figure 6.3 powers up with a slew rat e of \napproximaely12.5V/ms. Thus supply voltage to external logic transitions from GND to +5V in \napproximately 400 microseconds.  \n \nAs an alternative to the MOSFET, a dedicated power switch IC with inbuilt “soft -start” can be used. A \nsuitable power switch IC for such an application is the Micrel ( www.micrel.com ) MIC2025 -2BM or \nequivalent.  \n \nWith power switching controlled designs the following should be noted:  \n \ni) The external logic to which the power is being switched should have its own reset circuitry to \nautomatically reset the logic when power is re -applied when moving out of suspend mode.  \nii) Set the Pull -down on Suspend option in the internal FT234XD  MTP memory . \niii) The CBUS 0 Pin should be configured as PWREN# in the internal FT234XD  MTP memory , and used \nto switch the power supply to the external circuitry.  \niv) For USB high -power bus powered applications (one that consumes greater than 100mA, and up \nto 500mA of current from the USB bus), the power consumption of the application must be set in \nthe Max Power field in the internal FT234XD  MTP memory . A high -power bus powered application \nuses the descriptor in the internal FT234XD  MTP memory  to inform the s ystem of its power \nrequirements.  \nv) PWREN# gets its VCC from VCCIO. For designs using 3V3 logic, ensure VCCIO is not powered \ndown using the external logic. In this case use the +3V3OUT.  \n \nPlease also refer to TN_162 Bus Powered with Power Switching Configuration . \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  19 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n7 Application Examples  \n \nThe following sections illustrate possible applications of the FT234XD .  \n \n7.1 USB to RS232 Converter  \n \n \nFigure 7.1 Application Example showing USB to RS232 Converter  \n \nAn example of using the FT234XD  as a USB to RS232 converter is illustrated in Figure 7.1. In this \napplication, a 3V3 TTL to RS232 Level Converter IC is used on the serial UART interface of the FT234XD  \nto convert the 3V3 levels of the FT234XD  to RS232 levels. This level s hift can be done using line drivers \nfrom a variety of vendors e.g. Zywyn. A useful feature on some of these devices is the SHDN# pin which \ncan be used to power down the device to a low quiescent current during USB suspend mode.  \n \nA suitable level shifting d evice is the Zywyn  ZT3222F which is capable of RS232 communication at up to \n1000k baud.  \n \n7.2 USB to RS485 Coverter  \n \n \nFigure 7.2 Application Example Showing USB to RS485 Converter  \n \nAn example of using the FT234XD  as a USB to RS485 converter is shown in Figure 7.2. In this \napplication, a 3V3 -TTL to RS485 level converter IC is used on the serial UART interface of the FT234XD  to \nconvert the TTL levels of the FT234XD  to RS485 levels.  \n \nThis example uses the Zywyn ZT 485EEN  device. Equivalent devices are available from Maxim and \nAnalogue Devices. The ZT485EEN  is a RS485 device in a compact 8 pin SOP package. It has separate \nenables on both the transmitter and receiver. With RS485, the transm itter is only enabled when a \ncharacter is being transmitted from the UART  \n \n \n\n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  20 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n \nThe TXDEN signal CBUS pin option on the FT234XD  is provided for exactly this purpose and so the \ntransmitter enable is wir ed to CBUS  which has been configured as TXDEN.  Note that the TXDEN is \nactivated 1 bit period before the start bit. TXDEN is deactivated at the same time as the stop bit. This is \nnot configurable.   \n \nRS485 is a multi -drop network; so many devices can communicate with each other over a two wire cable \ninterface. The  RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each end of the cable. A link (which provides the \n120Ω termination) allows the cable to be terminated if the ZT3485 is physically positioned at either end \nof the cable.  \n \n7.3 USB to RS422 Converter  \n \n \nFigure 7.3 USB to RS422 Converter Configuration  \n \nAn example of using the FT234XD  as a USB to RS422 converter is shown in Figure 7.3. In this \napplication, two TTL to RS422 Level Converter ICs are used on the serial UART interface of the FT234XD  \nto convert the TTL levels of the FT234XD  to RS422 levels. There are ma ny suitable level converter \ndevices available. This example uses Zywyn  ZT490E devices . P-Channel MOSFET connected in the VCC \nline of ZT490E ensures that USB standby current of 2.5mA is not exceeded.  \n \nThe ZT490E  is specified to transmit and receive data at a rate of up to 10 Mbaud. In this example the \nmaximum data rate is limited to 3 Mbaud by the FT234XD . \n \n7.4 USB Battery Charging Detection  \n \nA recent addition to the USB specification  which is available in the link -\n(http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/BCv1.2_070312.zip ) is to allow for additional \ncharging profiles to be used for charging batteries in portable devices. These  charging profiles do not \nenumerate the USB port of the peripheral. The FT234XD  device will detect that a USB compliant \ndedicated charging port (DCP) is connected. Once detected while in suspend  mode,  a battery charge \ndetection signal is provided to allo w external logic to switch to charging mode as opposed to operation \nmode . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  21 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n \n \nFigure 7.4 USB Battery Charging Detection  \n \nTo use the FT234XD with battery charging detection the CBUS0 pin  must be reprogrammed to allow for \nthe BCD Charger output to switch the external cha rger circuitry on. The CBUS0 pin  is configured in the  \ninternal MTP memory with the free utility FT _PROG. If the charging circuitry requires an active low signal \nto enable i t, the CBUS 0 pin can be programmed to BCD Charger# as an alternative.  \n \nWhen connected to a USB compliant dedicated charging port (DCP, as opposed to a standard USB host) \nthe device USB signals will be shorted together and the device suspended. The BCD charger signal will \nbring the LTC4053 out of suspend and allow battery char ging to start. The charge current in the example \nabove is 1A as defined by the resistance on the PROG pin.  \n \nTo calculate the equivalent resistance on the PROG pin select a charge current, then Res = 1500V/I chg  \n \nFor more configuration options of the LTC40 53 refer to  AN_175 Battery Charger \nDetection over USB with FT -X Devices . \n  \nNote:  If the FT2 34XD is connected to a standard host port such that the device is enumerated the \nbattery charge detection signal is inactive as the device will not be in suspend.   \n\n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  22 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n \n7.5 LED Interface  \n \nThe CBUS 0 I/O pin can be configured to drive an LED. The FT234XD  has 3 configuration options for \ndriving LEDs from the CBUS. These are TXLED#, RXLED#, and TX& RXLED#. Refer to Section Error! \nReference source not found.  for configuration options.  \n \nNote that on FT -X series devices, the naming of the LED signals is relative to the USB inte rface. This is \ndifferent to the convention used on many other FTDI devices. Therefore,  \n \n- TXLED # indicates data is being received on the UART RxD pin and being transmitted  to the host \nover USB  \n- RXLED# indicates data is being received from the host over USB and is being transmitted  via the \nTxD pin of the UART  \n- TX&RXLED# uses a single CBUS pin to indicate data in either direction  \n \nFT234XD\nCBUS0VCCIO\n270R\nTX & \nRXLED#\n \nFigure 7.5 Single  LED Configuration  \n \nAn example of using the FT234XD  to drive an LED  is shown in Figure 7.5. In this example the CBUS 0 pin \nis used to indicate when data is being transmitted or received by the device (TX&RXLED). In this \nconfiguration the FT2 34XD will drive only a single LED.  \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  23 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n8 Internal MTP Memory  Configuration  \n \nThe FT234XD  includes an internal MTP memory which holds the USB configuration descriptors, other \nconfiguration data for the chip and also user data areas. Following a power -on reset or a USB reset the \nFT234XD  will scan its internal MTP memory  and read the USB configu ration descriptors stored there.  \n \nIn many cases, the default values programmed into the MTP memory will be suitable and no re -\nprogramming will be necessary. The defaults can be found in Section 8.1. \n \nThe MTP memory in the FT234XD  can be programmed over USB if the values need to be changed for a \nparticular application. Further details of this are provided from section 8.2 onwards.  \n \nUsers who do not have their own USB Vendor ID but who would like to use a unique Product ID in their \ndesign can apply to FTDI for a  free block of unique PIDs. Refer to  TN_100 – USB Vendor ID/Product ID \nGuidelines  for more details . \n \n8.1 Default Values  \n \nThe default factory programmed values of the internal MTP memory  are shown in  Table 8.1. \n \nParameter  Value  Notes  \nUSB Vendor ID (VID)  0403h  FTDI default  VID (hex)  \nUSB Product UD (PID)  6015h FTDI default PID (hex)  \nSerial Number Enabled?

This method is the same as for the \nEEPROM on other FTDI devices such as the FT232R. No additional hardware, connections or programming \nvoltages are required. The device is simply connected to the host compute r in the same way that it would \nbe for normal applications, and the FT_Prog utility is used to set the required options and program the \ndevice.  \n \nThe FT _Prog utility is provided free -of-charge from the FTDI website, and the user guide is also available \nat this link  - http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Utilities.htm#FT_Prog . \n \nAdditionally, D2XX commands can be used to program the MTP memory from within user applications.  \n \nFor more information on the commands available, please refer to D2XX Programmers Guide .  \n \n8.3 Memory  Map \n \nThe FT -X family MTP memory has various  areas which come under three main categories:  \n\uf0b7 User Memory Area  \n\uf0b7 Configuration Memory Area (writable)  \n\uf0b7 Configuration Memory Area (non -writable)  \n \nMemory Area Description  Word Address  \nUser Memory Area 2  \nAccessible  via USB  0x3FF - 0x80  \nConfiguration Memory Area  \nAccessible  via USB  0x7E - 0x50  \nConfiguration Memory Area  \nCannot be written  0x4E - 0x40  \nUser Memory Area 1  \nAccessible  via USB  0x3E - 0x12  \nConfiguration Memory Area  \nAccessible  via USB  0x10 - 0x00  \nFigure 8.1 Simplified memory map for the FT -X \n \nUser Memory Area  \n \nThe User Memory Areas are highlighted in Green on the memory map. They can be read and written via \nUSB on the FT234XD . All locations within this range are freely programmable; no areas have special \nfunctions and there is no checksum for the user area.  \n \nNote that the application should take into account the specification for the number of write cycles in \nSection 5.3 if it will be writing to the MTP memory multiple times.  \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  25 \nFT234XD  USB TO BASIC UART IC    \nVersion 1.4  \nDocument No.: FT_000753  Clearan ce No.: FTDI#324  \n \nConfiguration Memory Area (writable)  \n \nThis area stores the configuration data for the device, including the data which is returned t o the host in \nthe configuration descriptors (e.g. the VID, PID and string descriptions) and also values which set the \nhardware configuration (the signal assigned to each CBUS pin for example).  \n \nThese values can have a significant effect on the behaviour o f the device. Steps must be taken to ensure \nthat these locations are not written to un -intentionally by an application  which is intended to access only \nthe user area.  \n \nThis area is included in a checksum which covers configuration areas of the memory, and so changing \nany val ue can also cause this checksum to fail.  \n \nConfiguration Memory Area ( non-writable)  \n \nThis is a reserved area and the application should not write to this area of memory.
