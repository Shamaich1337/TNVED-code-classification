Combining high speed CMOS \nand monolithic air core transformer technology, this isolation \ncomponent provides outstanding performance characteristics \nand is easily integrated with low and full speed USB-compatible \nperipheral devices. \nMany microcontrollers implement USB so that it presents only the \nD+ and D− lines to external pins. This is desirable in many cases because it minimizes external components and simplifies the design; however, this presents particular challenges when isolation \nis required. Because the USB lines must switch between actively \ndriving D+/D− and allowing external resistors to set the state of the bus, the ADuM3160  provides mechanisms for detecting the \ndirection of data flow and control over the state of the output \nbuffers. Data direction is determined on a packet-by-packet basis. \nThe ADuM3160 uses the edge detection based iCoupler \ntechnology in conjunction with internal logic to implement  \na transparent, easily configured, upstream-facing port isolator. Isolating the upstream port provides several advantages in simplicity, power management, and robust operation. \nThe isolator has a propagation delay comparable to that of a \nstandard hub and cable. It operates with the bus voltage on either \nside ranging from 4.5 V to 5.5 V , allowing connection directly to \nV\nBUSx by internally regulating the voltage to the signaling level. \nThe ADuM3160 provides isolated control of the pull-up resistor \nto allow the peripheral to control connection timing. The device \ndraws low enough idle current that a suspend state is not required. \nA 5 kV , reinforced insulation version, the ADuM4160, is available. \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM \nVBUS2\nGND 2\nVDD2\nSPD\nPINDD–\nDD+GND\n216\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9REG\nPD LOGICREG\nPU LOGICVBUS1\nGND1\nVDD1\nPDEN\nSPU\nUD–\nUD+\nGND 11\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n09125-001 \nFigure 1.  \n \n \n1 Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952,849; 6,873,065; 7,075,329; and 8,432,812. \nADuM3160 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

C | Page 9 of 16 APPLICATIONS  INFORMATION  \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nUSB isolation  in the D+/D−  lines is challenging for several \nreasons. Fi rst, access to the output enable signals is normally \nrequired to control the transceiver . Some level of intelligence \nmust be built into the isolator to interpret the data stream and \ndetermine when to enable and disable its upstream  and down -\nstream  output buffers. Second, the signal must be faithfully \nreconstructed on the output side of the coupler while retaining \nprecise timing and not passing transien t states such as invalid \nSE0 and SE1 states.  In addition, the part must meet the  low \npower requirements of the s uspend mode.  \nThe iCoupler techno logy is based on edge detection  and, therefore,  \nlends itself well to the USB application. The flow of data throu gh \nthe device is accomplished by mon itoring the inputs for activity  \nand setting the direction for data transfer based on a transition from the i dle state. After  data directionality is established, data \nis transferred until either an e nd of packet (EOP) or a sufficiently  \nlong idle sta te is encountered. At this point, the coupler disables \nits output buffers and monitors its inputs for the next activity . \nDuring the data transfers, the input side of the coupler holds its output buffers disabled. The output side  enables its output buffers  \nand disables edge detection from the input buffers. This allows \nthe data to flow in one direction without wrapping ba ck through  \nthe coupler , caus ing the iCoupler to latch . Timing is based on the  \ndifferential input signal  transit ion. Logic is included to eliminate  \nany artifacts due to different input thresholds  of the differential \nand single -ended buffers.  The input  state is transferred across \nthe isolation barrier  as one of three valid states, J,  K, or SE0. The \nsignal is reconstr ucted at the output side with a fixed time delay \nfrom the input side differential input.  \nThe iCoupler does not have a special suspend mode, nor does it \nneed one because its power supply current is below the suspend \ncurrent limit of 2.5 mA when the USB bus is idle.  \nThe ADuM3160  is designed to inte rface with an upstream -facing  \nlow/f ull speed  USB port by isolating the D+/D − lines. An upstream -\nfacing port supports only one speed of operation ; therefore, the \nspeed -related parameters, J/K logic levels , and D+/D − slew rate are  \nset to match  the speed of the upstream -facing peripheral port  \n(see Table 10). \nA control line on the downstream  side of the ADuM3160 \nactivates the i dle state pull -up resistor. Thi s allow s the downstream  \nport to control w hen the upstream  port attaches t o the USB bus. \nThe PIN input can be tied to a 3.3  V control logic signal or to the  \nV\nDD2 rail depending on whether enumeration must be controlled \nor will occur when power is first applied.  \n PRODUCT US AGE  \nThe ADuM3160 is designed to be integrated into a USB \nperipheral with an upstream -facing USB port , as shown in \nFigure 4. The key design points are as follows: \n• The USB host provides power for the upstream  side of the \nADuM3160 through the cable.  \n• The peripheral supply  provides power to the downstream \nside of the ADuM3160. \n• The DD+/DD−  lines of the isolator interface with the \nperipheral controller, and the UD+/UD−  lines of the \nisolator connect to the cable or host.  \n• Peripheral devices have a fixed data rate that is set at design \ntime.  The ADuM3160 has configuration pins , SPU and \nSPD , that are set by the user to match this speed on the \nupstream and downstream sides of the coupler.  \n• USB enumeration begins when  either the D+ or D−  line is \npulled high at the peripheral end of th e USB cable. Control \nof the timing of this event is provided by the PIN input  on \nthe down stream side of the coupler.  \n• Pull-up and pull -down resistors are implemented inside \nthe coupler. Only external series resistors and bypass capacitors are required for operation.  \nUSB\nHOSTADuM3160MICRO-\nCONTROLLERPERIPHERA L\nPOWER\nSUPP LYVBUS\nGND BUSD+\nD–D+3.3V\nD–\n09125-004 \nFigure 4. Typica l ADuM 3160  Application  \nOther than the delayed application of pull -up resistors, the \nADuM3160 is transparent to USB traffic, and no modifications \nto the peripheral design are required to provide isolation. The \nisolator adds propagation delay to the signals comparable to a \nhub and cable. Isolated peripherals must be treated as if  there \nwere a built- in hub when determining the maximum number  \nof hubs in a data chain.  \nHubs can be isolated like any other peripheral. Isolated hubs can be  \ncreated by placing an ADuM3160 on the upstream port of a hub \nchip. This configuration can be made compliant if counted as two  \nhub delays. The hub chip allows the ADuM3160 to operate at full  \nspeed yet maintain compatibility w ith low speed devices.  \nADuM3160 Data Sheet \n \nRev. C | Page 10 of 16 COMPATIBILITY OF UPS TREAM APPLICATIONS  \nThe ADuM3160 is designed specifically for isolating a USB \nperipheral. However, the chip has two USB interfaces that meet \nthe elec trical requirements for driving USB cables. This opens the  \npossibility of implementing isolation in downstream USB ports \nsuch as isolated cables, which have generic connections to both \nupstream and downstream devices, a s well as isolating host ports.  \nIn a fully comp liant application, a downstream -facing port must \nbe able to detect whether a peripheral is low speed or full speed \nbased on the application of the upstream pull -up. The buffers \nand logic conventions must adjust to match the requested speed.  \nBecau se the ADuM3160 sets its speed by hard wiring pins, the \npart cannot adjust to di fferent peripherals on the fly.  \nThe practical result of using the ADuM3160 in a host port is \nthat the port works at a single speed. This behavior is acceptable \nin embedded host applications; however, this type of interface is \nnot fully compliant as a general -purpose USB port.  \nIsolated cable application s have a similar issue. The cable operates  \nat the preset speed only; therefore, treat cable assemblies as custom  \napplications, not general -purpose isolated cables.  \nPOWER SUPPL Y OPTIONS  \nIn most USB transceivers, 3.3 V is derived from the 5 V USB bus \nthrough  an LDO regulator. The ADuM3160 includes internal \nLDO regulators on both the upstream and downstream sides. The  \noutput of the LDO regulator s is available on the V DD1 and V DD2 pins. \nIn some ca ses, especially on the peripheral side of the isolation, \nthere may not be a 5 V power supply available. The ADuM3160 \nhas the ability to bypass the regulator and run on a 3.3 V supply \ndirectly . \nTwo power pins are present on each side, V BUSx and V DDx. If 5  V \nis supplied to V BUSx, an internal regulator creates 3.3  V to power \nthe xD+ and xD− drivers. V DDx provides external access to the \n3.3 V supply to allow external bypass as well as bias for external \npull- ups. If only 3.3 V is available, it can be supplied to both V BUSx \nand V DDx. This disables the regulator and powers the coupler \ndirectly from the 3.3 V supply.  \nFigure 5 shows how to configure a typical application when the \nupstream side of the coupler receives power directly from the US B \nbus and the downstream side receiv es 3.3 V from the peripheral \npower supply. The downstream side can run from a 5  V V BUS2 \npower supply as well. It can be connected in the same manner as V\nBUS1, as shown in Figure 5, if needed.  PRINTED CIRCUIT BOAR D LAYOUT  \nThe ADuM3160 digital isolator requires no external interface \ncircuitry for the logic interfaces. For full speed operation , the D+  \nand D − lines on each side of the device require a 24  Ω ± 1% series  \ntermination resistor.  These resistors are not required for low speed  \napplications.  Power supply bypassing is required  at the input and  \noutput supply pins ( see Figure 5). Install b ypass capacitors between  \nVBUSx and V DDx on each side of the chip . The capacitor s should  have  \na minimum value of 0.1 µF and low ESR.  The total lead length \nbetween both ends of the capacitor and the power supply pin should not exceed 1 0 mm . \nBypas sing between Pin 2  and Pin 8 and between Pin 9 and Pin  15 \nshould also be considered unless the ground pair on each package \nside is connected close to the package.  All logic level signals are \n3.3 V and should be referenced to the local V\nDDx pin or 3. 3 V logic  \nsignals from an external source.  \nVBUS1\nGND 1\nVDD1\nPDEN\nSPU\nUD–\nUD+\nGND 1VBUS2\nGND 2\nVDD2\nSPD\nPIN\nDD–\nDD+\nGND 2ADuM3160VBUS1  = 5.0V INPUT\nVDD1 = 3.3V OUTPUTVBUS2  = 3.3V INPUT\nVDD2 = 3.3V INPUT\n09125-005 \nFigure 5. Suggested  PCB  Layout  Example  \nIn applications that involv e high common -mode transients, care \nshould be taken to minimize  board coupling across the isol ation \nbarrier. Furthermore , design the board layout such that any coupling  \nthat does occur a ffects all pins equally on a given component side.  \nFailure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between pins  \nthat exceed  the absolute m aximum ratings  of the device, thereby  \nleading  to latch -up or permanent damage.  \nDC CORRECTNESS AND M AGNETIC FIELD \nIMM UNITY  \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause narrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the tran sformer.  \nThe decoder is bistable and is, therefore,  either set or reset by the \npulses, indicating input logic transitio ns. \nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the ADuM3160 \nis set by the condition in which induced voltage in the r eceiving \ncoil of the transformer  is sufficiently large to either falsely set or \nreset the decoder. The following analysis defines the conditions \nunder which this may occur. The 3 V operating condition of the ADuM3160 is examined because it represents the most suscep -\ntible mode of operation.  \nData Sheet ADuM3160 \n \nRev. C | Page 11 of 16 The pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0  V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at a pproximately  \n0.5 V , thus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages  \ncan be tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by  \nV = (−d β/dt) ∑ πr\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N  \nwhere:  \nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil ( cm).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM3160 and \nan imposed requirement that the induced voltage be , at most , \n50% of the 0.5 V  margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable \nmagnetic field is calculated as shown in Figure 6. \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n1k0.001100\n100M10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n10k 100k 1M 10M\n09125-006 \nFigure 6. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maxi -\nmum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a voltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This voltage is approximately  50% of  \nthe sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition.  \nSimilarly, if such an event occur s during a transmitted pulse (and \nis of the worst -case polarity), it reduces the r eceived pulse from \n>1.0  V to 0.75  V—still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of \nthe decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to sp ecific \ncurrent magnitudes a t given distances from the ADuM3160 trans -\nformers. Figure 7 expresses these allowable current magnitudes \nas a function of frequency for selected di stances. As shown  in \nFigure 7, the ADuM3160 is extremely immune and can be affected \nonly by extremely large currents operated at high frequency very  \nclose to the component. For  the 1 MHz example noted, a 0.5  kA \ncurrent must  be placed 5 mm away from the ADuM3160 to affect  \nthe operation  of the device .

Maxi mum Allowable Current   \nfor Various Current -to-ADuM3160  Spacings  \nNote that at combinations of strong magnetic field and high frequency, any loops formed by PCB  traces may  induce error \nvoltages  sufficiently large to trigger the thresholds of succeeding \ncircuitry. Care should be taken in the layout of such t races to \navoid this possibility.  \nINSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected \nto voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of i nsu-\nlation degradation is depende nt on the characteristics of the voltage  \nwaveform applied across the insulation. In addition to the testing  \nperformed by the regulatory agencies, Analog Devices carries out  \nan extensiv e set of evaluations to determine the lif etime of the \ninsulation structure within the ADuM3160.  \nAnalog Devices  performs accelerated life testing using voltage \nlevels higher than the rated con tinuous working vol tage. Accel -\neration factors for several operating conditions are determined. \nThese factors allow calculation of the time to failure at the actual  \nworking voltage . The values shown in Table 8 summarize  the \npeak voltage for 50 years of service life for a bipolar ac operating \ncondition and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working vol t-\nages. In many cases, the approved working voltage is higher than  \nthe 50-year service life voltage. Operation at these high working \nvolta ges can lead to shortened insulation life in some cases.  \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM3160 depends on the \nvoltage waveform type imposed across the isol ation barrier.  \nThe iCoupler insul ation structure  degrades at different rates  \ndepending on whether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10 illustrate the se differen t \nisolation voltage wav eforms.  \n \n  \n \n \nADuM3160 Data Sheet \n \nRev. C | Page 12 of 16 Bipolar ac voltage is the most stringen t environment. The goal \nof a 50 -year operating lifetime under the bipolar ac condition \ndetermines the maximum working voltage  recommended by \nAnalog Devices . \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insu -\nlation is significantly lower. This allows operation at higher \nworking volt ages while still achieving a 50 -year service life.  \nThe working voltages listed in Table 8 can be  applied  while \nmain taining the 50 -year minimum lifetime , provided th at th e \nvoltage conforms to either the unipolar ac or dc voltage case .  \nAny cross -insulation voltage waveform that does not conform \nto Figure 9 or Figure 10 should be treated as a bipolar ac wave -\nform , and its peak volt age should be limited to the 50 -year \nlifetime voltage value listed in Table 8.  \nNote that the volta ge shown in Figure 9 is presented as sinu -\nsoidal for illustration purposes only. The sinusoidal depiction  \nis meant to represent any vol tage waveform varying between \n0 V and some limiting value.
