  - Average Rectified Current (IO): 100 mA
  - Non-Repetitive Peak Forward Surge Current (IFSM): 2 A
- **Power Consumption:** 
  - Forward Voltage Drop (VF): 0.41 V (typical at IF = 100 mA)
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Junction Temperature (Tj): -55 to 125 °C
  - Storage Temperature (Tstg): -55 to 125 °C
- **Package Type:** 
  - SL2 (TOSHIBA: 1-1AL1A)
- **Special Features:**
  - Low forward voltage drop (VF = 0.41 V at 100 mA)
  - High-speed switching capability
- **Moisture Sensitive Level:** 
  - JEDEC J-STD-020E: Not specified in the provided text.

### Typical Applications:
The DSF01S30SL is commonly used in:
- **High-Speed Switching:** Ideal for applications requiring rapid switching times, such as in power supplies and converters.
- **Power Management:** Utilized in circuits where efficient power conversion is critical, including DC-DC converters and battery management systems.
- **Signal Processing:** Can be employed in RF applications due to its fast response time and low forward voltage drop.

### Additional Notes:
- Schottky diodes like the DSF01S30SL have higher reverse leakage currents compared to other diode types, which can lead to thermal runaway under high-temperature and high-voltage conditions. Careful thermal and safety design is recommended.
- The component is not intended for use in applications requiring extraordinarily high levels of reliability, such as medical devices or aerospace applications.
