The HMC129ALC4 is ideally suited for applications where small size, no dc bias, and consistent IC performance are required. This mixer can operate over a wide LO drive input of 9 dBm to 18 dBm. It performs equally well as a biphase modulator or demodulator. The HMC129ALC4 eliminates the need for wire \nbonding, allowing use of surface-mount manufacturing \ntechniques. \n \n 131\n3\n427NIC\nGND\nRF\nGND\n5\n6NIC\nNIC NIC\nPACKAGE\nBASE\nGND14NIC15GND16LO17GND18NICNIC\n8 GND\n9IF\n10 GND\n11 NIC\n12\n19 NIC NIC20NIC21NIC22NIC23NIC24NIC\nHMC129ALC4\n13882-001\nHMC129ALC4  Data Sheet\n \nRev. 0 | Page 2 of 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS \nFeatures .............................................................................................. 1  \nApplications ....................................................................................... 1  \nFunctional Block Diagram .............................................................. 1  \nGeneral Description ......................................................................... 1  \nRevision History ............................................................................... 2  \nSpecifications ..................................................................................... 3  \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings ............................................................ 4  \nThermal Resistance ...................................................................... 4  \nESD Caution .................................................................................. 4  \nPin Configuration and Function Descriptions ............................. 5  \nInterface Schematics..................................................................... 5  \nTypical Performance Characteristics ............................................. 6  Downconverter Performance ......................................................6  \nUpconverter Performance ............................................................8  \nIsolation and Return Loss ............................................................9  \nIF Bandwidth—Downconverter ............................................... 11  \nIF Bandwidth—Upconverter .................................................... 12  \nSpurious and Harmonics Performance ................................... 13  \nTheory of Operation ...................................................................... 14  \nApplications Information .............................................................. 15  \nTypical Application Circuit ....................................................... 15  \nEvaluation PCB Information .................................................... 15  \nOutline Dimensions ....................................................................... 16  \nOrdering Guide .......................................................................... 16  \n \nREVISION HISTORY \n7/2017—Revision 0: Initial Version \n \n \nData Sheet HMC129ALC4\n \nRev. 0 | Page 3 of 16 SPECIFICATIONS \nTA = 25°C, IF = 100 MHz, LO = 15 dBm, upper side band.

When used as an upconverter, the mixer upconverts intermediate \nfrequencies between dc and 3 GHz to radio frequencies between \n4 GHz and 8 GHz.  \n \nData Sheet HMC129ALC4\n \nRev. 0 | Page 15 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nTYPICAL APPLICATION CIRCUIT \nFigure 39 shows the typical application circuit for the \nHMC129ALC4. The HMC129ALC4 is a passive device \nand does not require any external components. The LO pin is internally ac-coupled. The RF and IF pins are internally \ndc-coupled. When IF operation to dc is not required, using an \nexternal series capacitor is recommended, of a value chosen to pass the necessary IF frequency range. When IF operation to dc is required, do not exceed the IF source and sink current rating \nspecified in the Absolute Maximum Ratings section.  \n \nFigure 39. Typical Application Circuit  EVALUATION PCB INFORMATION \nUse RF circuit design techniques for the circuit board used in \nthe application. Ensure that signal lines have 50 Ω impedance, \nand connect the package ground leads and the exposed pad directly to the ground plane (see Figure 40). Use a sufficient \nnumber of via holes to connect the top and bottom ground \nplanes.
