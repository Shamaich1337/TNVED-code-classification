It has true single-supply capability with an input volt-\nage range extending 200 mV below the negative rail and within\n1V of the positive rail.\n5V\n2.5V\n0V\n2/H9262s 1V VS = +5V\nFigure 1. Output Swing: Gain = –1, R L = 2 kWThe output voltage swing extends to within 25 mV of each rail,providing the maximum output dynamic range. Additionally, it\nfeatures gain flatness of 0.1 dB to 12 MHz, while offering differ-ential gain and phase error of 0.04% and 0.22 ∞ on a single +5 V\nsupply. This makes the AD8044 useful for video electronics,such as cameras, video switchers, or any high speed portableequipment. The AD8044’s low distortion and fast settling make\nit ideal for active filter applications.\nThe AD8044 offers low power supply current of 13.1 mA max\nand can run on a single +3.3 V power supply. These features areideally suited for portable and battery-powered applications\nwhere size and power are critical.\nThe wide bandwidth of 150 MHz, along with 170 V/ ms of slew\nrate on a single +5 V supply, make the AD8044 useful in many\ngeneral-purpose, high speed applications where dual power\nsupplies of up to ±6 V and single supplies from +3 V to +12 V\nare needed. The AD8044 is available in 14-lead PDIP and\nSOIC.\nNORMALIZED GAIN (dB)\n1M 10M 100M\nFREQUENCY (Hz)15\n12\n9\n6\n3\n0\n–3\n–6\n–9 VS = +5V\n G = +1\n–1218\n100k\nFigure 2.

The maximum safe junction temperature for plastic encap-\nsulated devices is determined by the glass transition temperature\nof the plastic, approximately +150 ∞C. Exceeding this limit\ntemporarily may cause a shift in parametric performance due to\na change in the stresses exerted on the die by the package.\nExceeding a junction temperature of +175 ∞C for an extended\nperiod can result in device failure.While the AD8044 is internally short-circuit protected, this may\nnot be sufficient to guarantee that the maximum junction tem-\nperature (+150 ∞C) is not exceeded under all conditions. To\nensure proper operation, it is necessary to observe the maximum\npower derating curves.\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE ( /H11543C)2.5\n2.0\n0.5–50 90 –40MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)\n–30 –20 –10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 801.5\n1.0\n70 14-LEAD SOIC  14-LEAD PLASTIC DIP PACKAGE TJ = +150 C  \nFigure 3.

The amplifier must recover from this over-\ndrive condition. As shown in Figure 33, the AD8044 recovers\nwithin 50 ns from negative overdrive and within 25 ns frompositive overdrive.\n50ns 1V VS = +5V\n AV = +2\n RF = 2k/H9024\n RL = 2k/H9024\nVIN\n2V/DIVVOUT\n1V/DIV\n2V\nFigure 33. Overdrive Recovery, VS + 5 V, V IN = 4 V Step\nCircuit Description\nThe AD8044 is fabricated on Analog Devices’ proprietary\neXtra-Fast Complementary Bipolar (XFCB) process which\nenables the construction of PNP and NPN transistors with\nsimilar f Ts in the 2 GHz–4 GHz region. The process is dielectri-\ncally isolated to eliminate the parasitic and latch-up problems\ncaused by junction isolation. These features allow the construc-\ntion of high frequency, low distortion amplifiers with low supplycurrents. This design uses a differential output input stage to\nmaximize bandwidth and headroom (see Figure 34). The\nsmaller signal swings required on the first stage outputs (nodesS1P, S1N) reduce the effect of nonlinear currents due to\njunction capacitances and im prove the distortion performance.\nWith this design harmonic distortion of better than –85 dB\n@ 1 MHz into 100 W with V\nOUT = 2 V p-p (Gain = +2) on a\nsingle 5 volt supply is achieved.\nThe AD8044’s rail-to-rail output range is provided by a comple-\nmentary common-emitter output stage. High output drive capa-bility is provided by injecting all output stage predriver currents\ndirectly into the bases of the output devices Q8 and Q36. Bias-\ning of Q8 and Q36 is accomplished by I8 and I5, along with acommon-mode feedback loop (not shown). This circuit topol-\nogy allows the AD8044 to drive 50 mA of output current with\nthe outputs within 0.5 V of the supply rails.\nOn the input side, the device can handle voltages from –0.2 V\nbelow the negative rail to within 1.2 V of the positive rail. Ex-\nceeding these values will not cause phase reversal; however, the\ninput ESD devices will begin to conduct if the input voltagesexceed the rails by greater than 0.5 V.Driving Capacitance Loads\nThe capacitive load drive of the AD8044 can be increased byadding a low valued resistor in series with the load. Figure 35\nshows the effects of a series resistor on capacitive drive for vary-\ning voltage gains. As the closed-loop gain is increased, the largerphase margin allows for larger capacitive loads with less over-\nshoot. Adding a series resistor with lower closed-loop gains\naccomplishes this same effect. For large capacitive loads, thefrequency response of the amplifier will be dominated by the\nroll-off of the series resistor and capacitive load.\nSIN\nR21 R3VEE\nQ11\nQ3I10\nR26 R39\nQ5 Q4\nQ40\nI7R2 R15\nQ13 Q17\nR5 C7Q2SIPQ22\nQ7\nQ21\nQ24R23 R27I2 I3 I1\nQ51Q25 Q50\nQ39\nQ47Q27Q31Q23I9\nI5\nVEE\nVCCI8Q36\nQ8VOUTC3\nC9VCC\nVINP\nVINN\nVEEI11\nFigure 34.

Capacitive Load Drive vs. Closed-Loop Gain\nAPPLICATIONS\nRGB Buffer\nThe AD8044 can provide buffering of RGB signals that include\nground while operating from a single +3 V or +5 V supply.\nWhen driving two monitors from the same RGB video source it\nis necessary to provide an additional driver for one of the moni-\ntors to prevent the double termination situation that the secondmonitor presents. This has usually required a dual-supply op\namp because the level of the input signal from the video driver\ngoes all the way to ground during horizontal blanking. In single-supply systems it can be a major inconvenience and expense to\nadd an additional negative supply.\nA single AD8044 can provide the necessary drive capability and\nyet does not require a negative supply in this application. Fig-ure 36 is a schematic that uses three amplifiers out of a single\nAD8044 to provide buffering for a second monitor.\nThe source of the RGB signals is shown to be from a set of three\ncurrent output DACs that are within a single-supply graphicsIC. This is typically the situation in most PCs and workstations\nthat may use either a standalone triple DAC or DACs that are\nintegrated into a larger graphics chip.\nDuring horizontal blanking, the current output from the DACs\nis turned off and the RGB outputs are pulled to ground by the\ntermination resistors. If voltage sources were used for the RGB\nsignals, then the termination resistors near the graphics ICwould be in series and the rest of the circuit would remain the\nsame. This is because a voltage source is an ac short circuit, so a\nseries resistor is required to make the drive end of the line see75W to ac ground. On the other hand, a current source has a\nvery high output impedance, so a shunt resistor is required to\nmake the drive end of the line see 75 W to ground. In either\ncase, the monitor terminates its end of the line with 75 W.\nThe circuit in Figure 36 shows minimum signal degradation\nwhen using a single-supply for the AD8044. The circuit per-\nforms equally well on either a +3 V or +5 V supply.A\n1k/H902410/H9262F+3V OR +5V\n75/H90240.1/H9262F\n1k/H9024\n75/H9024\nRGB\nMONITOR #2V+\nB\n1k/H902475/H9024\n1k/H9024\nC\n1k/H902475/H9024\n1k/H9024V–75/H9024\n75/H902475/H902475/H902475/H9024\nRGB\nMONITOR #175/H9024\n75/H902475/H9024R\nGB+5V\nGRAPHICS\nIC\nAD8044\nAD8044\nAD8044\nFigure 36.

Excessive phase shift produced by\nlower frequency op amps can significantly impact active filter\nperformance.\nFigure 38 shows an example of a 2 MHz biquad bandwidth\nfilter that uses three op amps of an AD8044 package.

Frequency Response of 2 MHz Band-pass\nBiquad FilterLayout Considerations\nThe specified high speed performance of the AD8044 requires\ncareful attention to board layout and component selection.\nProper RF design techniques and low-pass parasitic component\nselection are necessary.\nThe PCB should have a ground plane covering all unused por-\ntions of the component side of the board to provide a low im-\npedance path. The ground plane should be removed from the\narea near the input pins to reduce the stray capacitance.\nChip capacitors should be used for the supply bypassing. One\nend should be connected to the ground plane and the other\nwithin 1/8 inch of each power pin. An additional large (0.47 mF\n– 10 mF) tantalum electrolytic capacitor should be connected in\nparallel, but not necessarily so close, to supply current for fast,\nlarge signal changes at the output.\nThe feedback resistor should be located close to the inverting\ninput pin in order to keep the stray capacitance at this node to aminimum. Capacitance variations of less than 1 pF at the invert-\ning input will significantly affect high speed performance.\nStripline design techniques should be used for long signal traces\n(greater than about 1 inch). These should be designed with acharacteristic impedance of 50 W or 75 W and properly termi-\nnated at each end.\nAD8044\nREV.
