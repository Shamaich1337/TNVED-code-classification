The range, flatness, and accuracy of the gain response are achieved using Analog Devices’ X-AMP® architecture, the most recent in a \nseries of powerful proprietary concepts for variable gain \napplications, which far surpasses what can be achieved using \ncompeting techniques. \nThe input is applied to a 9-stage, 200 Ω resistive ladder network. \nEach stage has 5 dB of loss, giving a total attenuation of 45 dB. \nAt maximum gain, the first tap is selected; at progressively lower gains, the tap moves smoothly and continuously toward higher attenuation values. The attenuator is followed by a \n42.5 dB fixed gain feedback amplifier—essentially an \noperational amplifier with a gain bandwidth product of 100 GHz—and is very linear, even at high frequencies. The output third order intercept is +20 dBV at 100 MHz (+27 dBm, \nre 200 Ω), measured at an output level of 1 V p-p with V\nS = 5 V . The analog gain-control input is scaled at 20 mV/dB and runs \nfrom 50 mV to 950 mV . This corresponds to a gain of −2.5 dB \nto +42.5 dB, respectively, when the gain up mode is selected and +42.5 dB to −2.5 dB, respectively, when gain down mode is selected. The gain down, or inverse, mode must be selected \nwhen operating in AGC in which an integrated square-law \ndetector with an internal setpoint is used to level the output to 354 mV rms, regardless of the crest factor of the output signal. \nA single external capacitor sets up the loop averaging time. \nThe AD8367 can be powered on or off by a voltage applied to \nthe ENBL pin. When this voltage is at a logic LO, the total \npower dissipation drops to the milliwatt range. For a logic HI, the chip powers up rapidly to its normal quiescent current of \n26 mA at 25°C. The AD8367 is available in a 14-lead TSSOP \npackage for the industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C. \n \n \n \nAD8367  \n \nRev.

Simplified Architecture \nINPUT ATTENUATOR AND GAIN CONTROL \nThe variable attenuator consists of a 200 Ω single-ended \nresistive ladder that comprises of nine 5 dB sections and an \ninterpolator that selects the attenuation factor. Each tap point down the ladder network further attenuates the input signal  by a fixed decibel factor. Gain control is achieved by sensing \ndifferent tap points with variable transconductance stages. \nBased on the gain control voltage, an interpolator selects which stage(s) are active. For example, if only the first stage is active, the 0 dB tap point is sensed; if the last stage is active, the 45 dB tap point is sensed. Attenuation levels that fall between tap \npoints are achieved by having neighboring g\nm stages active \nsimultaneously, creating a weighted average of the discrete  \ntap point attenuations. In this way, a smooth, monotonic attenuation function is synthesized, that is, linear-in-dB  \nwith a very precise scaling. \nThe gain of the AD8367 can be an  increasing or decreasing \nfunction of the control voltage, V GAIN, depending on whether \nthe MODE pin is pulled up to the positive supply or down to \nground. When the MODE pin is high, the gain increases with \nVGAIN, as shown in Figure 28 . The ideal linear-in-dB scaled \ntransfer function is given by \nGain  (dB) = 50 × VGAIN − 5 (1) \nwhere VGAIN is expressed in volts.  \nEquation 1 contains the gain scaling factor of 50 dB/V (20 mV/dB) and the gain intercept of −5 dB, which represents the \nextrapolated gain for V\nGAIN = 0 V . The gain ranges from −2.5 dB \nto +42.5 dB for V GAIN ranging from 50 mV to 950 mV . The deviation from Equation 1, that is, the gain conformance error, is also illustrated in \nFigure 28 . The ripples in the error are a \nresult of the interpolation action between  tap points. The AD8367 provides better than ±0.5 dB of \nconformance error over >40 dB gain range at 200 MHz  \nand ±1 dB at 400 MHz. \n44\n40\n36\n32\n28\n24\n20\n16\n12\n8\n40\n–42.0\n–2.4–2.0–1.6–1.2–0.8–0.400.40.81.21.6\n0 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1\n02710-028\nVGAIN  (V)GAIN (dB)\nLINEARITY ERROR (dB)\nHI MODELO MODE50dB/V\nGAIN\nSLOPE\n \nFigure 28. The gain function can be either an increasing or decreasing \nfunction of V GAIN, depending on the MODE pin. \nThe gain is a decreasing function of V GAIN when the MODE pin \nis low. Figure 28  also illustrates this mode, which is described by \nGain  (dB) = 45 − 50 × VGAIN (2) \nThis gain mode is required in AGC applications using the built-\nin, square-law level detector. \nINPUT AND OUTPUT INTERFACES \nThe AD8367 was designed to operate best in a 200 Ω imped-\nance system. Its gain range, conformance law, noise, and \ndistortion assume that 200 Ω source and load impedances  \nare used. Interfacing the AD8367 to other common impedances (from 50 Ω used at radio frequencies to 1 kΩ presented by data converters) can be accomplished using resistive or reactive passive networks, whose design depends on specific system \nrequirements, such as bandwidth, return loss, noise figure,  \nand absolute gain range. \nThe input impedance of the AD8367 is nominally 200 Ω, \ndetermined by the resistive ladder network. This presents a \n200 Ω dc resistance to ground, and, in cases where an elevated \nsignal potential is used, ac coupling is necessary. The input signal level must not exceed 700 mV p-p to avoid overloading the input stage. The output impedance is determined by an internal 50 Ω damping resistor, as shown in \nFigure 29 . Despite \nthe fact that the output impedance is 50 Ω, the AD8367 should still be presented with a load of 200 Ω. This implies that the load is mismatched, but doing so preserves the distortion \nperformance of the amplifier.  \nAD8367  \n \nRev.

A 50 Ω resistor is added to the  \noutput to prevent package resonance. \nPOWER AND VOLTAGE METRICS \nAlthough power is the traditional metric used in the analysis  \nof cascaded systems, most active circuit blocks fundamentally \nrespond to voltage. The relationship between power and voltage is defined by the impedance level. When input and output impedance levels are the same, power gain and voltage gain  \nare identical. However, when impedance levels change between \ninput and output, they differ. Thus, one must be very careful to use the appropriate gain for system chain analyses. Quantities such as OIP3 are quoted in dBV rms as well as dBm referenced to 200 Ω. The dBV rms unit is defined as decibels relative to \n1 V rms. In a 200 Ω environment, the conversion from dBV rms \nto dBm requires the addition of 7 dB to the dBV rms value. For \nexample, a 2 dBV rms level corresponds to 9 dBm. \nNOISE AND DISTORTION \nSince the AD8367 consists of a passive variable attenuator \nfollowed by a fixed gain amplifier, the noise and distortion \ncharacteristics as a function of the gain voltage are easily predicted. The input-referred noise increases in proportion to \nthe attenuation level. \nFigure 30  shows noise figure, NF, as a \nfunction of V GAIN for the MODE pin pulled high. The minimum \nNF of 7.5 dB occurs at maximum gain and increases 1 dB for \nevery 1 dB reduction in gain. In receiver applications, the minimum NF should occur at the maximum gain where the received signal presumably is weak. At higher levels, a lower gain is needed, and the increased NF becomes less important. \nThe input-referred distortion varies in a similar manner to the noise. \nFigure 30  illustrates how the third-order intercept point \nat the input, IIP3, behaves as a function of V GAIN. The highest \nIIP3 of 20 dBV rms (27 dBm re 200 Ω) occurs at minimum gain. The IIP3 then decreases 1 dB for every 1 dB increase in gain. At lower levels, a degraded IIP3 is acceptable. Overall, the dynamic range, represented by the difference between IIP3 and \nNF, remains reasonably constant as a function of gain. The \noutput distortion and compression are essentially independent of the gain. At low gains, when the input level is high, input \noverload can occur, causing premature distortion. \n 60\n–30–20–100 0102030405060\n–30–20–101020304050\n0 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1\n02710-030\nVGAIN  (V)IIP3 (dBV)\nNF (dB)NF\nIIP3\n \nFigure 30.

The loop acts to suppress deviations from the reference at outputs below its corner frequency while not affect-ing signals above it, as shown in \nFigure 31 .

A | Page 13 of 24 RMS DETECTION \nThe AD8367 contains a square-law detector that senses  \nthe output signal and compares it to a calibrated setpoint of \n354 mV rms, which corresponds to a 1 V p-p sine wave. This setpoint is internally set and cannot be modified to change the \nAGC setpoint and the resulting VOUT level without using \nadditional external components. This is described in the \nModifying the AGC Setpoint  section.  \nAny difference between the output and setpoint generates  \na current that is integrated by an external capacitor, C AGC, \nconnected from the DETO pin to ground, to provide an AGC \ncontrol voltage. There is also an internal 5 pF capacitor on the \nDETO pin. The resulting voltage is used as an AGC bias. For this \napplication, the MODE pin is pulled low and the DETO pin is \ntied to the GAIN pin. The output signal level is then regulated to 354 mV rms. The AGC bias represents a calibrated rms measure of the received signal strength (RSSI). Since in AGC mode the output signal is forced to the 354 mV rms setpoint \n(−9.02 dBV rms), Equation 2 can be recast to express the \nstrength of the received signal, V\nIN-RMS , in terms of the AGC  \nbias V DETO. \nVIN − RMS  (dBV rms) = 54.02 + 50 × VDETO (4) \nwhere −54.02 dBV rms = −45 dB − 9.02 dBV rms. \nFor small changes in input signal level, V DETO responds with a \ncharacteristic single-pole time constant, τ AGC, which is \nproportional to C AGC. \nτAGC (μs) = 10 × CAGC (nf)  (5) \nwhere the internal 5 pF capacitor is lumped with the external \ncapacitor to give CAGC. \n \nAD8367  \n \nRev. A | Page 14 of 24 APPLICATIONS \nThe AD8367 can be configured either as a VGA whose gain  \nis controlled externally through the GAIN pin or as an AGC \namplifier, using a supply voltage of 2.7 V to 5.5 V . The supply  to the VPSO and VPSI pins should be decoupled using a low inductance, 0.1 μF surface-mount, ceramic capacitor as close  as possible to the device. Additional supply decoupling can  \nbe provided by a small series resistor. A 10 nF capacitor from \nPin DECL to Pin OCOM is recommended to decouple the \noutput reference voltage. \nINPUT AND OUTPUT MATCHING \nThe AD8367 is designed to operate in a 200 Ω impedance \nsystem. The output amplifier is a low output impedance voltage \nbuffer with a 50 Ω damping resistor to desensitize it from load reactance and parasitics. The quoted performance includes the \nvoltage division between the 50 Ω resistor and the 200 Ω load. \nThe AD8367 can be reactively matched to an impedance other than 200 Ω by using traditional step-up and step down \nmatching networks or high quality transformers. \nTable 4  lists \nthe 50 Ω S-parameters for the AD8367 at a V GAIN = 750 mV . \nFigure 32  illustrates an example where the AD8367 is matched \nto 50 Ω at 140 MHz. As shown in the Smith Chart, the input \nmatching network shifts the input impedance from Z IN to 50 Ω \nwith an insertion loss of <2 dB over a 5 MHz bandwidth. For \nthe output network, the 50 Ω load is made to present 200 Ω to \nthe AD8367 output. Table 5  provides the component values \nrequired for 50 Ω matching at several frequencies of interest. \nWhen added loss and noise can be tolerated, a resistive pad can \nbe used to provide broadband, near-matched impedances at the \ndevice terminals and the terminations.  Minimum-loss, L-pad networks are used on the evaluation \nboard (see Figure 45 ) to allow easy interfacing to standard  \n50 Ω test equipment. Each pad introduces an 11.5 dB power \nloss (5.5 dB voltage loss). \n1\n0.3333\n–0.3333\n–1–33\n0.3333 1 3\nZINRSOURCE\nSERIES L SHUNT C\n02710-032ZIN\nZINXSIN\n100nH\nZLOADZOUTXSOUT\n13pFCAC\n0.1μFRSOURCE\n50Ω\nRLOAD\n50Ω XPOUT\n120nHVSXPIN\n8.2pFAD8367fC = 140MHz, ZIN = 197 – j34.2, RSOURCE  = 50Ω\n \nFigure 32.

A | Page 15 of 24 VGA OPERATION \nThe AD8367 is a general-purpose VGA suitable for use in a \nwide variety of applications where voltage control of gain is \nneeded. While having a 500 MHz bandwidth, its use is not limited to high frequency signal processing. Its accurate, \ntemperature- and supply-stable linear-in-dB scaling is  \nvaluable wherever it is important to have a more dependable \nresponse to the control voltage than is usually offered by VGAs \nof this sort. For example, there is no preclusion to its use in \nspeech-bandwidth systems. \nFigure 33  shows the basic connections. The C HP capacitor at \nPin HPFL can be used to alter the high-pass corner frequency of \nthe signal path and is associated with the offset control loop that eliminates the inherent variation in the internal dc balance of the \nsignal path as the gain is varied (offset ripple). This frequency \nshould be chosen to be about a decade below the lowest frequency \ncomponent of the signal. If made much lower than necessary, the offset loop is not able to track the variations that occur when there are rapid changes in V\nGAIN. The control of offset is important even \nwhen the output is ac-coupled because of the potential reduction of the upper and lower voltage range at this pin. \nHowever, in many applications these components are unnecessary because an internal network provides a default \nhigh-pass corner of about 500 kHz. For C\nHP = 1 nF, the \nmodified corner is at ~10 kHz; it scales downward with \nincreasing capacitance. Figure 20  shows representative  \nresponse curves for the indicated component values. \n02710-033AD8367\nICOM1 ICOM 14\nENBL2 HPFL 13\nINPT3 VPSI 12\nMODE4 VPSO 11\nGAIN5 VOUT 10\nDETO6 DECL 9\nICOM7 OCOM 8VGAIN VOUTVIN\nC5\n10nFC1\n1μF\nC4\n0.1μFCHP\n10nFRHP\n100ΩR6\n4.7ΩR54.7ΩV\nP\nC3\n0.1μFC2\n0.1μF\n \nFigure 33. Basic Connections for Voltage Controlled Gain Mode \nMODULATED GAIN MODE \nThe AD8367 can be used as a means of modulating the signal \nlevel. Keep in mind, however, that the gain is a nonlinear \n(exponential) function of V GAIN; thus, it is not suitable for \nnormal amplitude-modulation functions. The small signal \nbandwidth of the gain interface is ~5 MHz, and the slew rate  is of the order of ±500 dB/μs. During gain slewing from close  to minimum to maximum gain (or vice versa), the internal \ninterpolation processes in an X-AMP-based VGA rapidly  \nscan the full range of gain values. The gain and offset ripple \nassociated with this process can cause transient disturbances  \nin the output. Therefore, it is inadvisable to use high amplitude \npulse drives with rise and fall times below 200 ns. AGC OPERATION \nThe AD8367 can be used as an AGC amplifier, as shown in \nFigure 34 . For this application, the accurate internal, square-law \ndetector is employed. The output of this detector is a current \nthat varies in polarity, depending on whether the rms value of \nthe output is greater or less than its internally-determined \nsetpoint of 354 mV rms. This is 1 V p-p for sine-wave signals, but the peak amplitude for other signals, such as Gaussian \nnoise, or those carrying complex modulation, is invariably \nsomewhat greater. However, for all waveforms having a crest factor of <5, and when using a supply voltage of 4.5 V to 5.5 V , \nthe rms value is correctly measured and delivered at V\nOUT. \nWhen using lower supplies, the rms value of V OUT is unaffected \n(the setpoint is determined by a band gap reference), but the \npeak crest factor capacity is reduced. \nThe gain pin is connected to the base of a transistor internally \nand thus requires only 1 μA of current drive. The output of the \ndetector is delivered to Pin DETO. The detector can source up to 60 μA and can sink up to 11 μA. For a sine-wave output signal, and under conditions where the AGC loop is settled, the \ndetector output also takes the form of a sine-wave, but at twice \nthe frequency and having a mean value of 0. If the input to the \namplifier increases, the mean of this current also increases and charges the external loop filter capacitor, C\nAGC, toward more \npositive voltages. Conversely, a reduction in V OUT below the \nsetpoint of 354 mV rms causes this voltage to fall toward ground. The capacitor voltage is the AGC bias; this can be  used as a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) output  \nand is scaled exactly as V\nGAIN, that is, 20 mV/dB. \n02710-034AD8367\nICOM1 ICOM 14\nENBL2 HPFL 13\nINPT3 VPSI 12\nMODE4 VPSO 11\nGAIN5 VOUT 10\nDETO6 DECL 9\nICOM7 OCOM 8VAGC VOUTVIN\nC5\n10nFCAGC\n0.1μFC1\n1μF\nC4\n0.1μFCHP\n10nFRHP\n100ΩR6\n4.7ΩR54.7ΩV\nP\nC3\n0.1μFC2\n0.1μF\n \nFigure 34. Basic Connections for AGC Operation \nA valuable feature of using a square law detector is that the  \nRSSI voltage is a true reflection of signal power and can be \nconverted to an absolute power measurement for any given \nsource impedance. The AD8367 can thus be employed as a \ntrue-power meter, or decibel-reading ac voltmeter, as distinct \nfrom its basic amplifier function. \nThe AGC mode of operation requires that the correct gain \ndirection is chosen. Specifically, the gain must fall as V AGC \nincreases to restore the needed balance against the setpoint. \nTherefore, the MODE pin must be pulled low. This accurate leveling function is shown in \nFigure 35 , where the rms output is \nAD8367  \n \nRev. A | Page 16 of 24 held to within 0.1 dB of the setpoint for >35 dB range of  \ninput levels. \nThe dynamics of this loop are controlled by C AGC acting in \nconjunction with an on-chip equivalent resistance, R AGC, of \n10 kΩ which form an effective time-constant T AGC = R AGC CAGC. \nThe loop thus operates as a single-pole system with a loop \nbandwidth of 1/(2π T AGC). Because the gain control function is \nlinear in decibels, this bandwidth is independent of the absolute \nsignal level.

AGC Response to a 32 dB Step in Input Level (f = 50 MHz) \nIt is important to understand that R AGC does not act as if in \nshunt with C AGC. Rather, the error-correction process is that of a \ntrue integrator, to guarantee an output that is exactly equal in \nrms amplitude to the specified setpoint. For large changes in \ninput level, the integrating action of this loop is most apparent. \nThe slew rate of V AGC is determined by the peak output current \nfrom the detector and the capacitor. Thus, for a representative value of C\nAGC = 3 nF, this rate is about 20 V rms or 10 dB/μs, \nwhile the small-signal bandwidth is 1 kHz. Most AGC loops incorporating a true error-integrating \ntechnique have a common weakness. When driven from an \nincreasingly larger signal, the AGC bias increases to reduce the gain. However, eventually the gain falls to its minimum value, for which further increase in this bias has no effect on the gain. That is, the voltage on the loop capacitor is forced progressively \nhigher because the detector output is a current, and the AGC \nbias is its integral. Consequently, there is always a precipitous increase in this bias voltage when the input to the AD8367 exceeds that value that overdrives the detector, and because the minimum gain is −2.5 dB, that happens for all inputs 2.5 dB \ngreater than the setpoint of ~350 mV rms. If possible, the user \nshould ensure that this limitation is preserved, preferably with a \nguard-band of 5 dB to 10 dB below overload \nIn some cases, if driven into AGC overload, the AD8367 \nrequires unusually long times to recover; that is, the voltage  \nat DETO remains at an abnormally high value and the gain is at its lowest value. To avoid this situation, it is recommended that \na clamp be placed on the DETO pin, as shown in \nFigure 37 . 02710-037AD83671 14\n2 13\n3 12\nMODE4 11\nGAIN5 10\nDETO6 9\nICOM7 8RB\nRACAGC\n0.1μFVAGC\nQ1\n2N29070.5V+VS\n \nFigure 37. External Clamp to Prevent AGC Overload.  \nThe resistive divider network, RA and RB, should be designed  \nsuch that the base of Q1 is driven to 0.5 V. \nMODIFYING THE AGC SETPOINT \nIf an AGC setpoint other than the internal one is desired, an \nexternal detector must be used. Figure 38  shows a method  \nthat uses an external true-rms detector and error integrator to operate the AD8367 as a closed-loop AGC system with a user-\nsettable operating level. \nThe AD8361 (U2) produces a dc output level that is \nproportional to the rms value of its input, taken as a sample  \nof the AD8367 (U1) output. This dc voltage is compared to  an externally-supplied setpoint voltage, and the difference is integrated by the AD820 (U3) to form the gain control voltage that is applied to the GAIN input of the AD8367 through the \ndivider composed of R4 and R5. This divider is included in \norder to minimize overload recovery time of the loop by having the integrator saturate at a point that only slightly overdrives the gain control input of the AD8367. The scale factor at V\nAGC is \ninfluenced by the values of R4 and R5; for the values shown, the factor is 86 mV/dB.  \n \n   AD8367\n \nRev.

This should be made long enough to provide sufficient smoothing of \nthe detector’s output in the presence of the modulation on the \nRF signal. A level fluctuation of less than 1 dB (<5% to 10%) p-p \nat the AD8361’s output is a reasonable value. A considerably longer time constant needlessly lowers the AGC bandwidth, while a short time constant can degrade the accuracy of the \ntrue-rms measurement process. Components C1, R2, and R3 \nset the control loop’s bandwidth and stability. The maximum \nstable loop bandwidth is limited by the rms detector’s averaging \ntime constant as previously discussed. \nFor an input signal consisting of a 4.096 MS/s QPSK modulated \ncarrier, the relationship between V SET and the output power for \nthis setup is shown in Figure 39 . The exponential shape reflects \nthe linear-in-magnitude response of the AD8361. The adjacent \nchannel power ratio (ACPR) as a function of output power is illustrated in \nFigure 40 .
