Thisdevice integrates a band-pass switched-capacitor antialiasing input filter, a 14-bit-resolutionanalog-to-digital converter (ADC), a 14-bit-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a low-passswitched-capacitor output-reconstruction filter, (sin x)/x compensation, and a serial port for data and controltransfers.\nThe internal circuit configuration and performance parameters are determined by reading control\ninformation into the eight available data registers. The register data sets up the device for a given mode of\noperation and application.\nThe major functions of the TLC320AC02 are:\n1. To convert audio-signal data to digital format by the ADC channel\n2. To provide the interface and control logic to transfer data between its serial input and output\nterminals and a digital signal processor (DSP) or microprocessor\n3. To convert received digital data back to an audio signal through the DAC channel\nThe antialiasing input low-pass filter is a switched-capacitor filter with a sixth-order elliptic characteristic. The\nhigh-pass filter is a single-pole filter to preserve low-frequency response as the low-pass filter cutoff isadjusted. There is a three-pole continuous-time filter that precedes this filter to eliminate any aliasing causedby the filter clock signal.\nThe output-reconstruction switched-capacitor filter is a sixth-order elliptic transitional low-pass filter followed\nby a second-order (sin x)/x correction filter. This filter is followed by a three-pole continuous-time filter toeliminate images of the filter clock signal.\nThe TLC320AC02 consists of two signal-processing channels, an ADC channel and a DAC channel, and\nthe associated digital control. The two channels operate synchronously; data reception at the DAC channel\nand data transmission from the ADC channel occur during the same time interval. The data transfer is in2s-complement format.\nThere are three basic modes of operation available: the stand-alone analog-interface mode, the\nmaster-slave mode, and the linear-codec mode. In the stand-alone mode, the TLC320AC02 generates theshift clock and frame synchronization for the data transfers and is the only AIC used. The master-slave modehas one TLC320AC02 as the master that generates the master-shift clock and frame synchronization; theremaining AICs are slaves to these signals. In the linear-codec mode, the shift clock and the frame-synchronization signals are externally generated and the timing can be any of the standard codec-timing\npatterns.\nTypical applications for this device include modems, speech processing, analog interface for DSPs,\nindustrial-process control, acoustical-signal processing, spectral analysis, data acquisition, andinstrumentation recorders.\nThe TLC320AC02C is characterized for operation from 0 °C to 70°C and the TLC320AC02I is characterized\nfor operation from –40 °C to 85°C.\n†The TLC320AC02 is functionally equivalent to the TLC320AC01 and differs in the electrical specifications as shown\nin Appendix C.\n1–21.1 Features\n•General-Purpose Signal-Processing Analog Front End (AFE)\n•Single 5-V Power Supply\n•Power Dissipation ...100 mW Typ\n•Signal-to-Distortion Ratio ...70 dB Typ\n•Programmable Filter Bandwidths (Up to 10.8 kHz) and Synchronous ADC and DAC Sampling\n•Serial-Port Interface\n•Monitor Output With Programmable Gains of 0 dB, –8 dB, –18 dB, and Squelch\n•Two Sets of Differential Inputs With Programmable Gains of 0 dB, 6 dB, 12 dB, and Squelch\n•Differential or Single-Ended Analog Output With Programmable Gains of 0 dB, –6 dB, –12 dB,\nand Squelch\n•Differential Outputs Drive 3-V Peak Into a 600- W Differential Load\n•Differential Architecture Throughout\n•1-mm Advanced LinEPIC \uf8ea Process\n•14-Bit Dynamic-Range ADC and DAC\n•2s-Complement Data Format\nLinEPIC is a trademark of Texas Instruments Incorporated.\n1–31.2 Functional Block Diagram\nDAC Channel\nOUT–OUT+AUX IN–AUX IN+IN–IN+\nDAC EOCFSDDINSCLKMCLKDOUT\nFS\nRESET ADC\nVMIDDGTL\nGNDDAC\nVDDPWR\nDWNCorrection(sin x)/xPortSerial\nReferenceVoltageInternalADC\nADC ChannelM\nU\nX XUM\nFilter26\n25\n28\n27\n3\n411\n12\n14\n13\n10\n1719\n25 9 2 3 8Filter\nM/S\n15\n1618\nFC0\nFC1\nDAC\nGND72 0\nDGTL\nVDDADC\nVDD24\nADC\nGND22\nSUBS21\nDAC\nVMID61MON OUT\nTerminal numbers shown are for the FN package.\n1.3 Terminal Assignments\n321\n13 145\n67\n8\n9\n10\n11IN–\nADC VDD\nADC VMID\nADC GNDSUBS\nDGTL GND\nEOCDAC V\nDD\nDAC VMID\nDAC GND\nRESET\nDGTL VDD\nDIN\nDOUT4\n15161718SCLK\nMCLK\nFC0\nFC1\nFSD\nM/SOUT –\nOUT +\nPWR DWNMON OUTFN PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\n28 27 26\n25\n24\n23\n22\n2120\n19\n12\nFS\nAUX IN +\nAUX IN –\nIN +\n1–41.3 Terminal Assignments (Continued)\n18 19NC\nNC\nOUT–\nNC\nNCOUT+\nPWR\n DWN\nNC\nMON OUT\nNC\nAUXIN+\nAUXIN–\nIN+IN–\nNC\nNC48\n47\n46\n45\n44\n43\n42\n41\n40\n39\n38\n37\n36\n35\n34\n33\n201\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16DIN\nNC\nDOUT\nFS\nNC\nNC\nNC\nSCLK\nNC\nMCLK\nFC0\nFC1\nNC\nFSD\nNC\nM/S\n21 22 23 24PM PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nNCDAC GND\n63 62 61 60 5964 58\nNC\nNC\nNC\nDGTL VNCRESET\nNC\nNC\nADC GND\nNCNCNC\nNC\nNC\nDGTL GND\nNC\nSUBS\nNC56 55 5457\n25 26 27 28 2953 52\n17\nEOC\nNC\nNC\n51 50 49\n30 31 32\nMID\nNCDAC VNC\nDAC V\nNC – No internal connection\nNC\nNC NC\nDDMIDDD\nADC V\nDDADC V\n1–51.4 Terminal Functions\nTERMINAL\nI/O DESCRIPTION\nNAME NO.†NO.‡I/O DESCRIPTION\nADC VDD2432IAnalog supply voltage for the ADC channel\nADC VMID2330OMidsupply for the ADC channel (requires a bypass capacitor).

The B register can be programmed for values greater than 20; however, since the sample rate is lower than\n7.2 kHz and the internal filter remains at 3.6 kHz, an external antialiasing filter is required.\n2. When the B register is programmed for a value less than 10, the ADC and the DAC conversions are not\ncompleted before the next frame-sync signal and the results are in error.\n3. The maximum sampling rate for the ADC channel is 43.2 kHz. The maximum rate for the DAC channel is\n25 kHz.\n1–81.5 Register Functional Summary\nThere are nine data registers that are used as follows:\nRegister 0 The No-op register. The 0 address allows phase adjustments to be made without\nreprogramming a data register.\nRegister 1 The A register controls the count of the A counter.Register 2 The B register controls the count of the B counter.Register 3 The A\n′ register controls the phase adjustment of the sampling period. The adjustment is\nequal to the register value multiplied by the input master period.\nRegister 4 The amplifier gain register controls the gains of the input, output, and monitor amplifiers.Register 5 The analog configuration register controls:\n•The addition/deletion of the high-pass filter to the ADC signal path\n•The enable/disable of the analog loopback\n•The selection of the regular inputs or auxiliary inputs\n•The function that allows processing of signals that are the sum of the regular inputs and\nthe auxiliary inputs (V\nIN + VAUX IN)\nRegister 6 The digital configuration register controls:\n•Selection of the free-run function\n•FSD [frame-synchronization (sync) delay] output enable/disable\n•Selection of 16-bit function\n•Forcing secondary communications\n•Software reset\n•Software power down\nRegister 7 The frame-sync delay register controls the time delay between the master-device frame\nsync and slave-device frame sync. Register 7 must be the last register programmed whenusing slave devices since all register data is latched and valid on the sixteenth falling edgeof SCLK. On the sixteenth falling edge of SCLK, all delayed frame-sync intervals are shiftedby this programmed amount.\nRegister 8 The frame-sync number register informs the master device of the number of slaves that are\nconnected in the chain. The frame-sync number is equal to the number of slaves plus one.\n2–12 Detailed Description\n2.1 Definitions and Terminology\nADC Channel All signal processing circuits between the analog input and the digital conversion\nresults at DOUT\nCodec Mode The operating mode under which the device receives shift clock and frame-sync\nsignals from a host processor. The device has no slaves.\nd The d represents valid programmed or default data in the control register format\n(see Section 2.19) when discussing other data-bit portions of the register.\nDxx Bit position in the primary data word (xx is the bit number)\nDAC Channel All signal processing circuits between the digital data word applied to DIN and the\ndifferential output analog signal available at OUT+ and OUT–\nData Transfer Interval The time during which data is transferred from DOUT and to DIN. This interval is 16\nshift clocks regardless of whether the shift clock is internally or externally generated.\nThe data transfer is initiated by the falling edge of the frame-sync signal.\nDSxx Bit position in the secondary data word (xx is the bit number)FCLK An internal clock frequency that is a division of MCLK that controls the low-pass filter\nand (sinx)/x filter clock (see Figure 1–1 and Table 1-1).\nf\ni The analog input frequency of interest\nFrame Sync The falling edge of the signal that initiates the data-transfer interval. The primary\nframe sync starts the primary communications, and the secondary frame sync startsthe secondary communications.\nFrame Sync and The time between falling edges of successive primary frame-sync signals\nSampling Period\nFrame-Sync Interval The time period occupied by 16 shift clocks. Regardless of the mode of operation,\nthere is always an internal frame-sync interval signal that goes low on the risingedge of SCLK and remains low for 16 shift clocks. It is used for synchronization ofthe serial-port internal signals. It goes high on the seventeenth rising edge of SCLK.\nf\ns The sampling frequency that is the reciprocal of the sampling period.\nHost Any processing system that interfaces to DIN, DOUT, SCLK, or FS .\nMaster Mode The operating mode under which the device generates and uses its own shift clock\nand frame-sync signal and generates all delayed frame-sync signals necessary tosupport slave devices.\nPhase Adjustment The programmed time variation from the falling edge of one frame-sync signal to the\nfalling edge of the next frame sync signal. The time variation is determined by the\ncontents of the A\n′ register. Since the time between falling edges of successive\nframe-sync signals is the the sampling period, the sampling period is adjusted.\nPrimary (Serial) The digital data-transfer interval. Since the device is synchronous, the signal data\nCommunications words from the ADC channel and to the DAC channel occur simultaneously.\nSecondary (Serial) The digital control and configuration data-transfer interval into DIN and the register\nCommunications read-data cycle from DOUT. The data-transfer interval occurs when requested by\nhardware or software.\nSignal Data The input signal and all of the converted representations through the ADC channel\nand return through the DAC channel to the analog output. This is contrasted withthe purely digital software-control data.\nSlave Mode The operating mode under which the device receives shift clock and frame-sync\nsignals from a master device.\n2–2Stand-Alone Mode The operating mode under which the device generates and uses its own shift clock\nand frame-sync signal. The device has no slave devices.\nX The X represents a don’t-care bit position within the control register format.\n2.2 Reset and Power-Down Functions\n2.2.1 Reset\nThe TLC320AC02 resets both the internal counters and registers, including the programmed registers, by\nany of the  following:\n•Applying power to the device, causing a power-on reset (POR)\n•Applying a low reset pulse to RESET\n•Reading in the programmable software reset bit (DS01 in register 6)\nPWR DWN resets the counters only and preserves the programmed register contents.\n2.2.2 Conditions of Reset\nThe two internal reset signals used for the reset and synchronization functions are as follows:\n1. Counter reset: This signal resets all flip-flops and latches that are not externally programmed with\nthe exception of those generating the reset pulse itself. In addition, this signal resets the software\npower-down bit.\nCounter reset = power-on reset + RESET  + RESET bit + PWR  DWN\n2. Register reset: This signal resets all flip-flops and latches that are not reset by the counter reset\nexcept those generating the reset pulse itself.\nRegister reset = power-on reset + RESET  + RESET bit\nBoth reset signals are at least one master-clock period long and release on the falling edge of the master\nclock.\n2.2.3 Software and Hardware Power-Down\nGiven the definitions and conditions of RESET,  the software-programmed power-down condition is cleared\nby resetting the software bit (DS00 in register 6) to zero. It is also cleared by either cycling the power to thedevice, bringing PWR\n DWN low, or bringing RESET  low.\nPWR DWN powers down the entire chip ( < 1 mA ). The software-programmable power-down bit only\npowers down the analog section of the chip ( < 3 mA ), which allows a software power-up function. CyclingPWR\n DWN high to low and back to high resets all flip-flops and latches that are not externally programmed,\nthereby preserving the register contents.\nWhen PWR  DWN is not used, it should be tied high.\n2.2.4 Register Default Values After POR, Software Reset, or RESET  Is Applied\nRegister 1 – The A RegisterThe default value of the A-register data is decimal 18 as shown below.\nDS07DS06DS05DS04DS03DS02DS01DS00\n00010010\n2–3Register 2 – The B Register\nThe default value of the B-register data is decimal 18 as shown below.\nDS07DS06DS05DS04DS03DS02DS01DS00\n00010010\nRegister 3 – The A ′Register\nThe default value of the A ′-register data is decimal 0 as shown below.\nDS07DS06DS05DS04DS03DS02DS01DS00\n00000000\nRegister 4 – The Amplifier Gain-Select Register\nThe default value of the amplifier gain-select register data is shown below.\nDS07DS06DS05DS04DS03DS02DS01DS00\n00000101\nRegister 5 – The Analog Control-Configuration RegisterThe power-up and reset conditions are as shown below.

The only difference between master and\nslave operations in the TLC320AC02 is that SCLK and FS  are outputs when M/S  is high and inputs when\nM/S is low.\nTable 2–1. Master-Slave Selection\nMODE M/S†FS SCLK\nMaster and Stand Alone HOutput Output\nSlave and Codec Emulation L Input Input\n†When the stand-alone mode is desired or when the device is\npermanently in the master mode, M/S  must be high.\n2.4 ADC Signal Channel\nTo produce excellent common-mode rejection of unwanted signals, the analog signal is processed\ndifferentially until it is converted to digital data. The signal is amplified by the input amplifier at one of threesoftware-selectable gains (typically 0 dB, 6 dB, or 12 dB). A squelch mode can also be programmed for theinput amplifier.\nThe amplifier output is filtered and applied to the ADC input. The ADC converts the signal into discrete digital\nwords in 2s-complement format corresponding to the analog-signal value at the sampling time. These 16-bit\ndigital words, representing sampled values of the analog input signal, are clocked out of the serial port(DOUT), one word for each primary communication interval. During secondary communications, the datapreviously programmed into the registers can be read out with the appropriate register address and with theread bit set to 1. When a register read is not requested, all 16 bits are 0.\n2.5 DAC Signal Channel\nDIN receives the 16-bit serial data word (2s complement) from the host during the primary communications\ninterval and latches the data on the seventeenth rising edge of SCLK. The data are converted to an analog\nvoltage by the DAC with a sample and hold and then through a (sin x)/x correction circuit and a smoothingfilter. An output buffer with three software-programmable gains (0 dB, –6 dB, and –12 dB), as shown inregister 4, drives the differential outputs OUT+ and OUT–. A squelch mode can also be programmed forthe output buffer. During secondary communications, the configuration program data are read into thedevice control registers.\n2.6 Serial Interface\nThe digital serial interface consists of the shift clock, the frame-synchronization signal, the ADC-channeldata output, and the DAC-channel data input. During the primary 16-bit frame-synchronization interval, theSCLK transfers the ADC channel results from DOUT and transfers 16-bit DAC data into DIN.\nDuring the secondary frame-synchronization interval, the SCLK transfers the register read data from DOUT\nwhen the read bit is set to a 1. In addition, the SCLK transfers control and device parameter information intoDIN. The functional sequence is shown in Figure 2–1.\n2–5\nÁÁ\nÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁRegister Read Data or All 0sÁÁÁADC Conversion Result\nDAC Input DataControl and Device Parameter\nData\nÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁ16 SCLKs\nÁÁÁÁÁÁ16 SCLKs\nÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁFrame-Sync Interval\n(primary communication)\nÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁÁFrame-Sync Interval\n(secondary\ncommunication)\nSCLK\nFS\nDOUT\nDIN[ (B register)/2] FCLK Periods †\n†The time between the primary and secondary frame sync is the time equal to filter clock (FCLK) period multiplied by the\nB-register contents divided by two. The time interval is rounded to the nearest shift clock. The secondary frame-sync\nsignal goes from high to low on the next shift clock low-to-high transition after (B register/2) filter clock periods.\nFigure 2–1. Functional Sequence for Primary and Secondary Communication\n2.7 Number of Slaves\nThe maximum number of slaves is determined by the sum of the individual device delays from the\nframe-sync (FS ) input low to the frame-sync delayed (FSD ) low for all slaves according to equation 1:\n(n) / tp(FS–FSD) < 1/2 shift-clock period (1)\nWhere:\nn is the number of slave devices.\nExample:From equation 1 above, the number of slaves is given by equation 2:\n(n)/C01181\n2\nx (SCLK period) x1\ntp(FS/C0042FSD)(2)\nassuming the master clock is 10.368 MHz and the shift clock is 2.5965 MHz and tp(FS – FSD) is 40 ns, then\naccording to equation 3, the number of slaves is:\nn/C01181\n2.5965 MHzx1\n2x1\n40 ns/C00431000\n192/C00434.8 (3)\nThe maximum number of slaves under these conditions is four.\n2–62.8 Required Minimum Number of MCLK Periods\nMaster with slave operation is summarized in the following sections.\n2.8.1 TLC320AC02 AIC Master-Slave Summary\nAfter initial setup and the master and slave frame syncs are separated, when secondary communication is\nneeded for a slave device, a 11 must be placed in the 2 LSBs of each primary data word for all devices in\nthe system, master and slave, by the host processor. In other words, all AICs must receive secondary frame\nrequests.\nThe host processor must issue the command by setting D01 and D00 to a 1 in the primary frame sync data\nword of all devices. Then the master generates the master primary frame sync and, after the number of shift\nclocks set by the FSD register value, the slave primary frame sync intervals. Then, after (B register value/2)\nFCLK periods, the master secondary frame sync occurs first, and then the slave secondary frame sync\noccurs. These are also rippled through the slave devices.\nIn other words, when a secondary communications interval is requested by the host processor as described\nabove:\n1. The master outputs the master primary frame sync interval, and then the slave primary frame\nsync intervals after the FSD register value number of shift clocks.\n2. After (B register value/2) FCLK periods, the master then outputs the master secondary frame\nsync interval, and after the FSD register value number of shift clocks, the slave secondary frame\nsync intervals.\nThis sequence is shown in Figure 2–2.The host must keep track of whether the master or a slave is then being addressed and also the number\nof slave devices. The master always outputs a 00 in the last 2 bits of the DOUT word, and a slave always\noutputs a 1 in the LSB of the DOUT word. This information allows the system to recognize a starting pointby interrogating the least significant bit of the DOUT word. If the LSB is 0, then that device is the master,\nand the system is at the starting point.\nNote: This identification always happens except in 16-bit mode when the 2 LSBs are not available\nfor identification purposes.\nSampling Period(B Register Value/2) FCLK Periods\nFSD Value\nin SCLKs\nFrame Sync\nSequence\nMP SP1 SP2 SPn MS SS1 SS2 SSn MP Period Symbol\nPeriods shown: Each period  must be a minimum of 16 SCLKs plus 2 additional SCLKs\nMP = Master Primary Period\nSP1 = 1st Slave Primary Period\nSP2 = 2nd Slave Primary PeriodSPn = nth Slave Primary PeriodMS = Master Secondary Period\nSS1 = 1st Slave Secondary Period\nSS2 = 2nd Slave Secondary PeriodSSn = nth Slave Secondary Period\nFigure 2–2. Timing Sequence\n2–72.8.2 Notes on TLC320AC01/02 AIC Master-Slave Operation\nMaster/slave operational detail is summarized in the following notes:\n1. The slave devices can be programmed independently of the master as long as the clock divide\nregister numbers are not changed. The gain settings, for example, can be changed\nindependently.\n2. The method that is used to program a slave independently is to request a secondary\ncommunication of the master and all slaves and ripple the delayed frame sync to the desired slavedevice to be programmed.\n3. Secondary frame syncs must be requested for all devices in the system or none. This is required\nso that the master generates secondary frames for the slaves and allows the slaves to know that\nthe second frame syncs they receive are secondary frame syncs. Each device in the system must\nreceive a secondary frame request in its corresponding primary frame sync period (11 in the last2 LSBs).\n4. Calculation of the sampling frequency in terms of the master clock and the shift clock and the\nrespective register ratios is (see equations 4–6):\nSampling frequency /C0043f\ns/C0043FCLK\nB register value\n/C0043f(MCLK)\n2 (A register value) /C0032(B register value ) (4)\nTherefore,\nf(MCLK)\nfs/C00432/C0032(A register value )/C0032(B register value )(5)\nand in terms of the shift clock frequency, since\n(6)f(SCLK)\nfs/C0043(A register value) /C0032(B register value )\n2\n/C0043Number of SCLK periods\nSampling periodf(MCLK) /C00434/C0032f(SCLK)\nthen\n5. The minimum number of shift clocks between falling edges of any two frame syncs is 18 because\nthe frame sync delay register minimum number is 18.\nWhen a secondary communication is requested by the host, the master secondary frame sync\nbegins at the middle of the sampling period (followed by the slave secondary frame syncs), so all\nprimary frame sync intervals (master and slave) must occur within one-half the sampling time.\n2–8The first secondary frame-sync falling edge, therefore, occurs at the following time (see\nequation 7):\nTime to first secondary frame sync /C0043B register value\n2(FCLK periods )/C0043\n(7)A register value /C0032B register value (number of MCLK periods) /C0043\nA register value /C0032B register value\n4(number of SCLK periods)\n6. Number of frame sync intervals using equation 8.\nAll master and slave primary frame sync intervals must occur within the time of equation 7.\nSince 18 shift clocks are required for each frame sync interval, then the number of frame sync\nintervals from equation 8 is:\nNumber of frame sync intervals /C0043A register value /C0032B register value\n4/C003218 (SCLKs /C0324frame sync interval)\n(8) /C0043A register value /C0032B register value\n72\n7. Number of devices, master and slave, in terms of f(MCLK) and f s.\nSubstituting the value from equation 5 for the A ×B register value product gives the total number\nof devices, including the master and all slaves that can be used, for a given master clock and\nsampling frequency. Therefore, using equation 9:\nNumber of devices /C0043f(MCLK)\n144/C0032fs(9)\n8. Number of devices, master and slave, if slave devices are reprogrammed.\nEquation 9 does not include reprogramming the slave devices after the frame sync delay occurs.\nSo if programming is required after shifting the slave frame syncs by the FSD register, then the\ntotal number of devices is given by equation 10 is:\nNumber of devices /C0043f(MCLK)\n288/C0032fs(10)\n9. Example of the maximum number of devices if the slave devices are reprogrammed assuming\nthe following values:\nf(MCLK) /C004310.368 MHz, fs/C00438k H z\nthen from equation 10,\nMaximum number of devices /C004310.368 MHz\n288 (8 kHz)/C00434.5\ntherefore, one master and three slaves can be used.\n2–92.9 Operating Frequencies\n2.9.1 Master and Stand-Alone Operating Frequencies\nThe sampling (conversion) frequency is derived from the master-clock (MCLK) input by equation 11:\nfs/C0043Sampling (conversion) frequency /C0043MCLK\n(A register value) /C0032(B register value) /C00322(11)\nThe inverse is the time between the falling edges of two successive primary frame-synchronization signals.\nThe input and output data clock (SCLK) frequency is given in equation 12:\nSCLK frequency /C0043MCLK frequency\n4(12)\n2.9.2 Slave and Codec Operating Frequencies\nThe slave operating frequencies are either the default values or programmed by the control data word from\nthe master and codec conversion and the data frequencies are determined by the externally applied SCLKand FS\n signals.\n2.10 Switched-Capacitor Filter Frequency (FCLK)\nThe filter clock (FCLK) is an internal clock signal that determines the filter band-pass frequency and is theB counter clock. The frequency of the filter clock is derived by equation 13:\nFCLK/C0043MCLK\n(A register value) /C00322(13)\n2.11 Filter Bandwidths\nThe low-pass (LP) filter –3 dB corner is derived in equation 14:\nf( L P )/C0043FCLK\n40/C0043MCLK\n40/C0032(A register value) /C00322(14)\nThe high-pass (HP) filter –3 dB corner is derived in equation 15:\nf( H P )/C0043Sampling frequency\n200/C0043MCLK\n200/C00322/C0032(A register value) /C0032(B register value)(15)\n2.12 Master and Stand-Alone Modes\nThe difference between the master and stand-alone modes is that in the stand-alone mode there are no\nslave devices. Functionally these two modes are the same. In both, the AIC internally generates the shiftclock and frame-sync signal for the serial communications. These signals and the filter clock (FCLK) arederived from the input master clock.The master clock applied at the MCLK input determines the internaldevice timing. The shift clock frequency is a divide-by-four of the master clock frequency and shifts both the\ninput and output data at DIN and DOUT, respectively, during the frame-sync interval (16 shift clocks long).\nTo begin the communication sequence, the device is reset (see Section 2.2.1), and the first frame syncoccurs approximately 648 master clocks after the reset condition disappears.\n2.12.1 Register Programming\nAll register programming occurs during secondary communications, and data is latched and valid on thesixteenth falling edge of SCLK. After a reset condition, eight primary and secondary communications cyclesare required to set up the eight programmable registers. Registers1 through 8 are programmed in\nsecondary communications intervals 1 through 8, respectively. If the default value for a particular register\nis desired, that register does not need to be addressed during the secondary communications. The no-opcommand addresses the pseudo-register (register 0), and no register programming takes place during thiscommunications. The no-op command allows phase shifts of the sampling period without reprogrammingany register.\nDuring the eight register programming cycles, DOUT is in the high-impedance state. DOUT is released on\nthe rising edge of the eighth primary internal frame-sync interval. In addition, each register can be read back\n2–10during DOUT secondary communications by setting the read bit to 1 in the appropriate register. Since the\nregister is in the read mode, no data can be written to the register during this cycle. To return this register\nto the write mode requires a subsequent secondary communication (see Section 2.19 for detailed registerdescription).\n2.12.2 Master and Stand-Alone Functional Sequence\nThe A counter counts according to the contents of the A register, and the A counter frequency is divided bytwo to produce the filter clock (FCLK). The B counter is clocked by FCLK with the following functionalsequence:\n1. The B counter starts counting down from the B register value minus one. Each count remains in\nthe counter for one FCLK period including the zero count. This total counter time is referred to\nas the B cycle. The end of the zero count is called the end of B cycle.\n2. When the B counter gets to a count of nine, the analog-to-digital (A-to-D) conversion starts.3. The A-to-D conversion is complete ten FCLK periods later.\n4. FS\n goes low on a rising edge of SCLK after the A-to-D conversion is complete. That rising edge\nof SCLK must be preceded by a falling edge of SCLK, which is the first falling edge to occur afterthe end of B cycle.\n5. The D-to-A conversion cycle begins on the rising edge of the internal frame-sync interval and is\ncomplete ten FCLK periods later.\n2.13 Slave and Codec Modes\nThe only difference between the slave and codec modes is that the codec mode is controlled directly by the\nhost and does not use a delayed frame-sync signal. In both modes, the shift clock and the frame sync areboth externally generated and must be synchronous with MCLK. The conversion frequency is set by the timeinterval of externally applied frame-sync falling edges except when the free-run function is selected by bit5of register 6 (see Section 2.15.4). The slave device or devices share the shift clock generated by the masterdevice but receive the frame sync from the previous slave in the chain. The Nth slave FS\n receives the\n(N–1)st slave FSD  output and so on. The first slave device in the chain receives FSD  from the master.\n2–112.13.1 Slave and Codec Functional Sequence\nThe A counter counts according to the contents of the A register, and the A counter frequency is divided by\ntwo to produce the FCLK. The device function in the slave or codec mode is the same as steps 1 through\n3 of the B cycle description in the master mode but differs as follows:\n1. Same as master\n2. Same as master\n3. Same as master\n4. All internal clocks stop 1/2 FCLK before the end of count 0 in the B counter cycle.\n5. All internal clocks are restarted on the first rising edge of MCLK after the external FS  input goes\nlow. This operation provides the synchronization necessary when using an external FS  signal.\n6. The D-to-A conversion starts on the rising edge of the internally generated frame-sync interval\nat the end of the 16-shift clock data transfer.\nIn the slave mode, the master controls the phase adjustments for itself and all slaves since all devices are\nprogrammed in the same frame-sync interval. In the codec mode, the shift clock and frame sync areexternally generated and provide the timing for the ADC and DAC if the free-run function has not been\nselected (see Subsection 2.15.4). In the codec mode, there is usually no need for phase adjustments;\nhowever, any required phase adjustments must be made by adjusting the external frame-sync timing(sampling time).\n2.13.2 Slave Register Programming\nWhen slave devices are used on power-up or reset, all slave frame-sync signals occur at the same time asthe master frame-sync signal and all slave devices are programmed during the master secondary frame-sync interval with the same data as the master. The last register programmed must be the frame-sync delay(FSD) register because the delay starts immediately on the rising edge of the seventeenth shift clock of thatframe- sync interval. After the FSD register programming is completed for the master and slave,  the slave\nprimary frame interval is shifted in time (time slot allocated) according to the data contained in the slave FSD\nregisters. The master then generates frame-sync intervals for itself and each slave to synchronize the hostserial port for data transfers for itself and all slave devices.\nThe number of slaves is specified in the FSN register (register 8); therefore, the number of frame-sync\nintervals generated by the master is equal to the number of slaves plus one (see Section 2.7). These masterframe-sync intervals are separated in time by the delay time specified by the FSD register (register 7). Thesemaster-generated intervals are the only frame-sync interval signals applied to the host serial port to provide\nthe data-transfer time slot for the slave devices.\n2.14 Terminal Functions\n2.14.1 Frame-Sync Function\nThe frame-sync signal indicates that the device is ready to send and receive data for both master and slave\nmodes. The data transfer begins on the falling edge of the frame-sync signal.\n2.14.1.1 Frame Sync (FS ), Master Mode\nThe frame sync is generated internally. FS  goes low on the rising edge of SCLK and remains low for the\n16-bit data transfer. In addition to generating its own frame-sync interval, the master also outputs a framesync for each slave that is being used.\n2–122.14.1.2 Frame-Sync Delayed (FSD ), Master Mode\nFor the master, the frame-sync delayed output occurs 1/2 shift-clock period ahead of FS  to compensate for\nthe time delay through the master and slave devices. The timing relationships are as follows:\n1. When the FSD register data is 0, then FSD  goes low on the falling edge of SCLK prior to the rising\nedge of SCLK when FS  goes low (see Figure 4–4).\n2. When the FSD register data is greater than 17, then FSD  goes low on a rising edge of SCLK that\nis the FSD register number of SCLKs after the falling edge of FS .\nRegister data values from 1 to 17 should not be used.\n2.14.1.3 Frame Sync (FS ), Slave Mode\nThe frame-sync timing is generated externally, applied to FS , and controls the ADC and DAC timing (see\nSubsection 2.15.4). The external frame-sync width must be a minimum of one shift clock to be recognizedand can remain low until the next data frame is required.\n2.14.1.4 Frame-Sync Delayed (FSD ), Slave Mode\nThis output is fed from the master to the first slave and the first slave FSD  output to the second and so on\ndown the chain. The FSD timing sequence in the slave mode is as follows:\n1. When the FSD register data is 0, then FSD  goes low after FS  goes low (see Figure 4–5).\n2. When the FSD register data is greater than 17, FSD  goes low on a rising edge of SCLK that is\nthe FSD register number of SCLKs after the falling edge of FS .\nData values from 1 to 17 should not be used.\n2.14.2 Data Out (DOUT)\nDOUT is placed in the high-impedance state on the seventeenth rising edge of SCLK (internal or external)\nafter the falling edge of frame sync. In the primary communication, the data word is the ADC conversionresult. In the secondary communication, the data is the register read results when requested by theread/write (R/W\n) bit with the eight MSBs set to 0 (see Section 2.16). If no register read is requested, the\nsecondary word is all zeroes.\n2.14.2.1 Data Out, Master Mode\nIn the master mode, DOUT is taken from the high-impedance state by the falling edge of frame sync. The\nmost significant data bit then appears on DOUT.\n2.14.2.2 Data Out, Slave Mode\nIn the slave mode, DOUT is taken from the high-impedance state by the falling edge of the external framesync or the rising edge of the external SCLK, whichever occurs first (see Figure 4–7). The falling edge of\nframe sync can occur \n±1/4 SCLK period around the SCLK rising edge (see Figure 4–3). The most\nsignificant data bit then appears on DOUT.\n2.14.3 Data In (DIN)\nIn the primary communication, the data word is the digital input signal to the DAC channel. In the secondary\ncommunication, the data is the control and configuration data to set up the device for a particular function(see Section 2.16).\n2.14.4 Hardware Program Terminals (FC1 and FC0)\nThese inputs provide for hardware programming requests for secondary communication or phase\nadjustment. These inputs work in conjunction with the control bits D01 and D00 of the primary data word\nor control bits DS15 and DS14 of the secondary data word. The data on FC1 and FC0 are latched on therising edge of the next internally generated primary or secondary frame-sync interval. These inputs shouldbe tied low if not used (see Section 2.17 and Table 2–3).\n2–132.14.5 Midpoint Voltages (ADC V MID and DAC V MID)\nSince the device operates at a single-supply voltage, two midpoint voltages are generated for internal signal\nprocessing. ADC V MID is used for the ADC channel reference, and DAC V MID is used for the DAC channel\nreference. Two references minimize channel-to-channel noise and crosstalk. ADC V MID and DAC V MID\nmust be buffered when used as a reference for external signal processing.\n2.15 Device Functions\n2.15.1 Phase Adjustment\nIn some applications, such as modems, the device sampling period may require an adjustment tosynchronize with the incoming bit stream to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The TLC320AC02 can adjust\nthe sampling period through the use of the A\n′ register and the control bits.\n2.15.1.1 Phase-Adjustment Control\nA phase adjustment is a programmed variation in the sampling period. A sampling period is adjusted\naccording to the data value in the A ′ register, and the phase adjustment is that number of master clocks\n(MCLK). An adjustment is made during device operation with data bits D01 and D00 in the primarycommunication, with data bits DS15 and DS14 in the secondary word or in combination with the hardwareterminals FC1 and FC0 (see Table 2–3). This adjustment request is latched on the rising edge of the nextinternal frame-sync interval and is only valid for the next sampling period. To repeat the phase adjustment,another phase request must be initiated.\n2.15.1.2 Use of the A ′ Register for Phase Adjustment\nThe A′ register value makes slight timing adjustments to the sampling period. The sampling period\nincreases or decreases according to the sign of the programmed A ′ register value and the state of data bits\nD01 and D00 in the primary data word.\nThe general equation for the conversion frequency is given in equation 16:\n/C0043MCLK\n(2/C0032A register value /C0032B register value) /C0034(A/C0512register value)fs = conversion frequency (16)\nTherefore, if A ′ = 0, the device conversion (sampling) frequency and period is constant.\nIf a nonzero A ′ value is programmed, the sampling frequency and period responds as shown in Table 2–2.\nTable 2–2. Sampling Variation With A ′\nSIGN OF THE A ′ REGISTER VALUE\nD01 D00 PLUS VALUE\n(+)NEGATIVE VALUE\n(–)\n01\n(increase command)Frequency decreases,\nperiod increasesFrequency increases,\nperiod decreases\n10\n(decrease command)Frequency increases,\nperiod decreasesFrequency decreases,\nperiod increases\nAn adjustment to the sampling period, which must be requested through D01 and D00 of the primary data\nword to DIN, is valid for the following sampling period only. When the adjustment is required for thesubsequent sampling period, it must be requested again through D01 and D00 of the primary data word.For each request, only the sampling period occurring immediately after the primary data word request isaffected.\n2–14The amount of time shift in the entire sampling period (1/f s) is as follows:\nWhen the sampling period is set to 125 ms (8 kHz), the A ′ register is loaded with decimal 10 and the\nTLC320AC02 master clock frequency is 10.386 MHz. The amount of time each sampling period is increased\nor decreased, when requested, is given in equation 17:\nTime shift = (A ′ register value) × (MCLK period) (17)\nThe device changes the entire sampling period by only the MCLK period times the A ′ register value as given\nin equation 18:\nChange in sampling period = contents of A ′ register × master clock period\n= 10 × 96.45 ns = 964 ns (less than 1% of the sampling period) (18)\nThe sampling period changes by 964.5 ns each time the phase adjustment is requested by the primary data\nword (i.e., once per sampling period).\nIt is evident then that the change in sampling period is very small compared to the sampling period. To\nobserve this effect over a long period of time (> sampling period), this change must be continuouslyrequested by the primary data word. If the adjustment is not requested again, the sampling period  changes\nonly once and it may appear that there was no execution of the command. This is especially true when bench\ntesting the device. Automatic test equipment can test for results within a single sampling period.\nInternally, the A\n′ register value only affects one cycle (period) of the A counter. The A and A ′ values are\nadditive, but only for one A-counter period. The A counter begins the first count at the default or programmed\nA-register value and counts down to the A ′-register value. As the A ′ value increases or decreases, the first\nclock cycle from the A counter is lengthened or shortened. The initial A-counter period is the only counter\nperiod affected by the A ′ register such that only this single period is increased or decreased.\n2.15.2 Analog Loopback\nThis function allows the circuit to be tested remotely. In loopback, OUT+ and OUT– are internally connected\nto IN+ and IN–. The DAC data bits D15 to D02 that are applied to DIN can be compared with the ADC output\ndata bits D15 to D02 at DOUT. There are some differences due to the ADC and DAC channel offset. Theloopback function is implemented by setting DS01 and DS00 to zero in control register 5 (see Section 2.19).When analog loopback is enabled, the external inputs to IN+ and IN– are disconnected, but the signals atOUT+ and OUT– may still be read.\n2.15.3 16-Bit Mode\nIn the 16-bit mode, the device ignores the last two control bits (D01 and D00) of the primary word andrequests continual secondary communications to occur. By ignoring the last two primary communicationbits, compatibility with existing 16-bit software can be maintained. This function is implemented by settingbit DS03 to 1 in register 6. To return to normal operation, DS03 must be reprogrammed to 0.\n2.15.4 Free-Run Mode\nWith the free-run bit set in register 6, the external shift clock and frame sync control only the data transfer.The ADC and DAC timing are controlled by the A and B register values, and the phase-shift adjustment mustbe done as if the device is in stand-alone mode (by the software or the state of FC1 and FC0).\nPhase adjustment cannot be made by adjustment of the frame-sync timing. The external frame sync must\noccur within 1/2 FCLK period of the internal frame sync (FCLK as determined by the values of the A andB registers).\nWhen the external frame sync occurs simultaneously with the internal load, the data-transfer request by the\nexternal frame sync takes precedence over an internal load command. The latching of the ADC conversiondata in the output register is inhibited until the current 16 bits are shifted out of the register by the shift clock.\n2.15.5 Force Secondary Communication\nWith bit 2 in register 6 set to 1, secondary communication is requested continuously. It overrides all softwareand hardware requests concerning secondary communication. Phase shifting, however, can still beperformed with the software and hardware.\n2–152.15.6 Enable Analog Input Summing\nBy setting bits DS01 and DS00 to 11 in register 5, the normal analog input voltage is summed with the\nauxiliary input voltage. The gain for the analog input amplifier is set by data bits DS03 and DS02 in register4.\n2.15.7 DAC Channel (sin x)/x Error Correction\nThe (sin x)/x compensation filter is designed for zero (sin x)/x error using a B-register value of 15. Since thefilter cannot be removed from the signal path, operation using another B-register value results in an errorin the reconstructed analog output. The error is given by equation 19. Any error compensation needed bya given application can be performed in the software.\nDAC channel frequency response error /C004320/C0032log10\n/C0551/C0551/C0551/C0545\n/C0546sin/C04662/C0112/C0032A/C0032B\nfMCLK/C0032f/C0467\nsin/C046630/C0112/C0032A\nfMCLK/C0032f/C0467/C003215\nB/C0551/C0551/C0551/C0547\n/C0548(19)\nwhere:\nf = the frequency of interest\nfMCLK= the TLC320AC02 master-clock frequency\nA = the A-register valueB = the B-register value\nand the arguments of the sin functions are in radians.\n2.16 Serial Communications\n2.16.1 Stand-Alone and Master-Mode Word Sequence and Information Content During\nPrimary and Secondary Communications\nFor the stand-alone and master modes, the sequence in Figure 2–2 shows the relationship between the\nprimary and secondary communications interval, the data content into DIN, and the data content fromDOUT.\nThe TLC320AC02 can provide a phase-shift command or the next secondary communications interval by\ndecoding 1) the programmed state of the FC1 and FC0 inputs and the D01 and D00 data bits in the primary\ndata word, or 2) the state of the FC1 and FC0 inputs and the DS15 and DS14 data bits in the secondary\ndata word (see Table 2–3). When DS13 (the R/W\n bit) is the default value of 0, all 16 bits from DOUT are\n0 during secondary communication. However, when the R/W  bit is set to 1 in the secondary communication\ncontrol word, the secondary transmission from DOUT still contains 0s in the eight MSBs. The lower order8 bits contain the data of the register currently being addressed. This function provides register statusinformation for the host.\n2–16DOUT[ (B register)/2] FCLK Periods †\nPrimary Frame Sync\n(16 SCLKs long)Secondary Frame Sync\n(16 SCLKs long)FS\n2s-Complement ADC Output(14 bits plus 00 for the two LSBs)16 Bits All 0s, Except When in\nRead Mode (then least significant8 bits are register data)\nDIN2s-Complement Input for the DAC\nChannel (14 bits plus two function bits).

Master and Stand-Alone Functional Sequence\n2.16.2 Slave and Codec-Mode Word Sequence and Information Content During\nPrimary and Secondary Communications\nFor the slave and codec modes, the sequence is basically the same as the stand-alone and master modes\nwith the exception that the frame sync and the shift clock are generated and controlled externally as shownin Figure 2–3. For the codec mode, the frame-sync pulse width needs to be a minimum of one shift clocklong. The timing relationship between the frame sync and shift clock is shown in the timing diagrams. Phase\nshifting is usually not required in the slave or codec mode because the frame-sync timing can be adjusted\nexternally if required.\nDOUTPrimary Frame Sync Secondary Frame SyncFS\n2s-Complement ADC Output\n(14 bits plus 00 for the 2 LSBs inmaster and stand-alone mode and01 in slave mode)16 Bits, All 0s, Except When in\nRead Mode (then least significant8 bits are register data)\nDIN2s-Complement Input for the DAC\nChannel (14 bits plus two function bits)Input Data for the Internal\nRegisters (16 bits containing control, address, and datainformation)1 SCLK Minimum 1 SCLK Minimum\nNOTE A: The time between the primary and secondary frame syncs is determined by the application; however, enough\ntime must be provided so that the host can execute the required number of software instructions in the time\nbetween the end of the primary data transfer (rising edge of the primary frame-sync interval) and the falling\nedge of the secondary frame sync (start of secondary communications).\nFigure 2–4. Slave and Codec Functional Sequence\n2–172.17 Request for Secondary Serial Communication and Phase Shift\nThe following paragraphs describe a request for secondary serial communication and phase shift using\nhardware control inputs FC1 and FC0, primary data bits D01 and D00, and secondary data bits DS15 andDS14.\n2.17.1 Initiating a Request\nCombinations of FC1 and FC0 input conditions, bits D01 and D00 in the primary serial data word, FC1 andFC0, and bits DS15 and DS14 in the secondary serial data word can initiate a secondary serialcommunication or request a phase shift according to the following rules (see Table 2–3).\n1. Primary word phase shifts can be requested by either the hardware or software when the other\nset of signals are 11 or 00. If both hardware and software request phase shifts, the software\nrequest is performed.\n2. Secondary words can be requested by either the software or hardware at the same time that the\nother set of signals is requesting a phase shift.\n3. Hardware inputs FC1 and FC0 are ignored during the secondary word unless DS15 and DS14\nare 11. When DS15 and DS14 are 01 or 10, the corresponding phase shift is performed. When\nDS15 and DS14 are 00, no phase shift is performed even when the hardware requests a phase\nshift.\n2.17.2 Normal Combinations of Control\nThe normal combinations of control are as follows:\n1. Use D01 and D00 and DS15 and DS14 to request phase shifts and secondary words by holding\nFC1 and FC0 to 00.\n2. Use FC1 and FC0 exclusively to request phase shifts and secondary words by holding D01 and\nD00 to 00 and DS15 and DS14 to 11.\n3. Use D01 and D00 only to request secondary words and FC1 and FC0 to perform phase shifts\nonce per period by holding DS15 and DS14 to 00.\n2.17.3 Additional Control Options\nAdditional control options are unusual and are rarely needed or used; however, they are as follows:\n1. Use D01 and D00 only to request secondary words and FC1 and FC0 to perform phase shifts\ntwice per period by holding DS15 and DS14 to 11.\n2.

The 2 LSBs are set to 0 in the ADC result.\n2–192.18.1 Primary Serial Communications Data Format\nD15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D09 D08 D07 D06 D05 D04 D03 D02 D01 D00\n14-bit DAC Conversion Result\n2s-Complement Format †Control Bits\n†Since the supply voltage is single ended, the reference for 2s-complement format is ADC V MID. Voltages above\nthis reference have a 0 as the MSB, and voltages below this reference have a 1 as the MSB.\nDuring primary serial communications, when D01 and D00 are both high in the DAC data word to DIN, a\nsubsequent 16 bits of control information is received by the device at DIN during a secondaryserial-communication interval. This secondary serial-communication interval begins at 1/2 the programmedconversion time when the B register data value is even or 1/2 the programmed value minus one FCLK whenthe B register data value is odd. The time between primary and secondary serial communication ismeasured from the falling edge of the primary frame sync to the falling edge of the secondary frame sync\n(see Section 2.19 for function and format of control words).\n2.18.2 Data Format From DOUT During Primary Serial Communications\n14-Bit ADC Conversion Result\n2s-Complement Format\nD15 is the Sign BitD15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D09 D08 D07 D06 D05 D04 D03 D02 D01 D00\n/C0458D01/C00430\nD00/C00430\n/C0458D01/C00430\nD00/C00431Master Mode\nSlave Mode\n2.19 Secondary Serial Communications\n2.19.1 Data Format to DIN During Secondary Serial Communications\nThere are nine 16-bit configuration and control registers numbered from zero to eight.

The general format of the commands during secondaryserial communications is as follows.\nDS15 DS14 DS13 DS12 DS11 DS10 DS09 DS08 DS07 DS06 DS05 DS04 DS03 DS02 DS01 DS00\nControl Bits\n(2 bits)R/W\nBitRegister Address\n(5 bits)Register Data Value\n(8 bits)\nAll control register words are latched in the register and valid on the sixteenth falling edge of SCLK.\n2.19.2 Control Data-Bit Function in Secondary Serial Communication\n2.19.2.1 DS15 and DS14\nIn the secondary data word, bits DS15 and DS14 perform the same control function as the primary control\nbits D01 and D00 do in the primary data word.\nDS15 DS14 DS13 DS12 DS11 DS10 DS09 DS08 DS07 DS06 DS05 DS04 DS03 DS02 DS01 DS00\nR/W Register Address Register Data Control Bits\nHardware terminals FC1 and FC0 are valid inputs when DS15 and DS14 are both high, and they are ignored\nfor all other conditions.\n2–202.19.2.2 DS13 (R/W  Bit)\nReset and power-up procedures set this bit to a 0, placing the device in the write mode. When this bit is set\nto 1, however, the previous data content of the register being addressed is read out to the host from DOUTas the least significant 8 bits of the 16-bit secondary word. The first 8 bits remain set to 0. Reading the dataout is nondestructive, and the contents of the register remain unchanged.\nA. Write Mode (DS13 = 0)\nData In.

ADC absolute gain error is the variation in gain from the ideal gain over the specified input signal levels.\nThe gain is measured with a –1-dB, 1020-Hz sine wave. The –1-dB input signal allows for any positive gainor offset error that may affect gain measurements at or close to 0-dB input signal levels.\n14. The DAC input signal is the digital equivalent of a 1020-Hz sine wave (full-scale analog output at digital full-\nscale input = 0 dB). The nominal differential DAC channel output voltage with this input condition is 6 V peak\nto peak.

The\nproblem is how to do it easily and efficiently.\nThis application report addresses the issue of connecting two channels of an analog interface circuit (AIC)\nto one TMS320C5X DSP serial port. In this application report, the AIC is the TLC320AC02.\nThe TLC320AC02 (and TLC320AC01) analog interface circuit contains both A/D and D/A converters and\nusing the master/slave mode, it is possible to connect two of them to one TMS320C5X DSP serial port with\nno additional logic. The hardware schematic is shown in Figure D–1.\nD–2TMS320C5x\nCLKOUT\nDX\nDR\nFSX\nFSR\nCLKX\nCLKRTLC320AC02\nMCLK\nDIN\nDOUT\nFS\nSCLKFSD\nTLC320AC02\nMCLK\nDIN\nDOUT\nFS\nSCLKFSDMaster Mode\nSlave Mode14\n10\n11\n12\n1314\n10\n11\n12\n13\nNOTE A: Terminal numbers shown are for the FN package.\nFigure D–1.  Master With Slave (to DSP Interface)\nHARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SOLUTION\nOnce the hardware connections are completed, the issue becomes distinguishing one channel from\nanother. Fortunately, this is very easy to do in software and adds very little overhead. The mode that the\nAC02s run in is called master/slave mode. One AC02 is the master and all of the rest of the AC02s areslaves. The master can be distinguished from all of the slaves by examining the least significant bit (LSB)\nin the receive word coming from the AC02. The master has a 0 in the LSB and all of the slaves have a 1\nin the LSB.\nThe AC02s in master/slave mode take turns communicating with the DSP serial port. They do this is a round\nrobin or circular fashion. Synchronizing the system involves looking for the master AC02 and then starting\nthe software associated with the first AC02. All other AC02s follow in order. It is possible to have different\nsoftware for each AC02.\nA reference design was constructed using a TMS320C5X DSP starter kit (DSK). The AC02s were\nconnected to the TDM serial port which is available at the headers on the edge of the DSK.\nA listing of the DSK assembly code for a simple stereo input/output program is included in the following\nsection.\nD–3SOFTWARE MODULE\nMODULE NAME: INOUTB.ASM\nIn-out routine for C5X DSK with two TLC320AC02s on the \nTDM serial port of the C5X in master/slave mode.\nThis version performs the in/out task for both the master \nand slave TLC320AC02 in the receive interrupt service routine.************************************************************************************************\n***************************************************************************** *******************\n* .mmregs\n.ds 01000h\nPR1 .word 0104h ;A register\nPR2 .word 0219h ;B register\nPR3 .word 0300h ;A prime registerPR4 .word 0405h ;amplifier gain registerPR5 .word 0501h ;analog configuration registerPR6 .word 0600h ;digital configuration register\nPR7 .word 0730h ;frame synch delay register\nPR8 .word 0802h ;frame synch number registervalue .word 0800hvalue2 .word 0800hval_add .word 0200h\nval_add2 .word 0400h\n***********************************************************************************\n***********************************************************************************\nSet up the ISR vector\n.ps 080ah\nrint: B RECEIVE ; 0A; Serial port receive interrupt RINT.\nxint: B TRANSMIT ; 0C; Serial port transmit interrupt XINT.\ntrint: B TDMRECtxint: B TDMTX\n;\n*\n***********************************************************************************\n***********************************************************************************\nTMS320C5X INITIALIZATION\n.ps 0a00h.entry\nSTART: SETC INTM ; Disable interrupts\nLDP #0 ; Set data page pointerOPL #0834h,PMSTLACC #0SAMM CWSR\nSAMM PDWSR\nD–4splk #00c8h\nSPLK 082h,IMRcall AC02INIT\nCLRC OVM ; OVM = 0\nSPM 0 ; PM = 0SPLK #042h,IMR ; TDMA ser port rec interrupt\nSPLK #0C8h,TSPC ;\nCLRC INTM ; enable interrupts\nloop ; main program here does nothing.\nnop ; a user program can be inserted.b loop ;\n;\nend of main program ;\n;\n; TDM serial port receiver interrupt service routine\n;\nTDMREC:\n; This loop insures that the master AC02\nldp #trcv ; is the first one that is written to in thebit trcv,15 ; loop. the slave AC02(s) will follow inbcnd xxx,tc ; sequential order.
