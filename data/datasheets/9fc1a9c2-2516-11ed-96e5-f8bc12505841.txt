The typical optocoupler concerns regarding uncertain current \ntransfer ratios, nonlinear transfer functions, and temperature and \nlifetime effects are eliminated with the simple iCoupler digital \ninterfaces and stable performance characteristics. The need for \nexternal drivers and other discrete components is eliminated \nwith these iCoupler products. Furthermore, iCoupler devices \nconsume one-tenth to one-sixth the power of optocouplers at \ncomparable signal data rates. \nThe ADuM1200/ ADuM1201 isolators provide two independent \nisolation channels in a variety of channel configurations and \ndata rates (see the Ordering Guide). Both devices operate with \nthe supply voltage on either side ranging from 2.7 V to 5.5 V , providing compatibility with lower voltage systems as well as enabling a voltage translation functionality across the isolation barrier. In addition, the ADuM1200 /ADuM1201 provide low \npulse width distortion (<3 ns for CR grade) and tight channel-to-channel matching (<3 ns for CR grade). Unlike other optocoupler alternatives, the ADuM1200/ ADuM1201 isolators \nhave a patented refresh feature that ensures dc correctness in the absence of input logic transitions and during power-up/power-down conditions.  \nThe ADuM1200W  and ADuM1201W  are automotive grade \nversions qualified for 125°C operation. See the Automotive \nProducts section for more information. \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS \nENCODE DECODEENCODE DECODEVDD1\nVIA\nVIB\nGND1VDD2\nVOA\nVOB\nGND 21\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5\n04642-001\nFigure 1.\n ADuM1200  Functional Block Diagram \nENCODE DECODEDECODE ENCODEVDD1\nVOA\nVIB\nGND1VDD2\nVIA\nVOB\nGND 21\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5\n04642-002\nFigure 2.\n ADuM1201  Functional Block Diagram \n1 Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952,849; 6,873,065; 6,903,578; and 7,075,329. \nADuM1200/ADuM1201 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Output supply current values are specified with no output load \npresent. The supply current associated with an individu al channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power C onsumption  section. See \nFigure 6 throug h Figure 8 for information on per -channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through Figure 11 \nfor total V DD1 and V DD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1200 and  ADuM1201 channel configurations.  \n2 The minimum pulse  width is the shortest pulse  width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n3 The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n4 tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ox signal. t PLH propagation delay is \nmeasured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ox signal.  \n5 tPSK is the magnitude of the worst -case difference in t PHL and/or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output \nload within the recommended operating conditions.  \n6 Codirectional  channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any t wo channels with inputs on the same side of \nthe isolation barrier. Opposing  directional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with \ninputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrie r. \n7 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate that can be s ustained while maintaining V O > 0.8 V DD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate \nthat can be sustained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The common -mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common- mode voltage edges. The transient \nmagnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.   \n8 Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in the signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for \ninformation on per -channel supply current  as a funct ion of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions.

See \nFigure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per- channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloade d and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through Figure 11 \nfor tota l VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1200 and ADuM1201 channel configurations.  \n2 The minimum pulse  width is the shortest pulse  width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n3 The maximum data rate is the fastest da ta rate at which the specified pulse  width distortion is guaranteed.  \n4 tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ox signal. t PLH propagation delay is \nmeasured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ox signal.  \n5 tPSK is the magnitude of the worst -case difference in t PHL and/or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply v oltages, and output \nload within the recommended operating conditions.  \n6 Codirectional  channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the sa me side of \nthe isolation barrier. Opposing  directional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with \ninputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.  \n7 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate that c an be sustained while maintaining V O > 0.8 V DD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate \nthat can be sustained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The com mon -mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common -mode voltage edges. The transient \nmag nitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.  \n8 Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in the signal data rate.

See Figure 9 through Figure 11 \nfor total I DD1 and I DD2 supply currents as a f unction of data rate for ADuM1200W  and ADuM1201W channel configurations.  \n2 The minimum pulse  width is the shortest pulse  width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n3 The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.  \n4 tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the V Ox signal. t PLH propagation delay is \nmeasured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the V Ox signal.  \n5 tPSK is the magnitude of the worst -case difference in t PHL and/or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output \nload within the recommended operating conditions.  \n6 Codirectional  channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of \nthe isolation barrier. Opposing  directional channel -to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with \ninputs on opposing sides of the iso lation barrier.  \n7 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining V O > 0.8 V DD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate \nthat can be sustained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The common -mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common -mode voltage edges. The transient \nmagnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.  \n8 Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in the signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for \ninformation on per -channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions.

Power supply bypassing \nis strongly recommended at the input and output supply pins.  \nThe capacitor value must be between 0.01 μF and 0.1 μF.  \nThe total lead length between both ends of the capacitor and \nthe input power supply pin must not exceed 20 mm. \nSee the AN-1109 Application Note  for board layout guidelines. \nPROPAGATION DELAY-RELATED PARAMETERS \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it takes \na logic signal to propagate through a component. The propagation \ndelay to a logic low output can differ from the propagation delay to a logic high output. \nINPUT ( VIx)\nOUTPUT (VOx)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n04642-012 \nFigure 12. Propagation Delay Parameters \nPulse width distortion is the maximum difference between \nthese two propagation delay values and is an indication of  \nhow accurately the timing of the input signal is preserved. \nChannel-to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthat the propagation delay differs between channels within a \nsingle ADuM1200 /ADuM1201 component. \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount that  \nthe propagation delay differs between multiple ADuM1200/ \nADuM1201 components operating under the same conditions. \nDC CORRECTNESS AND MAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input send \nnarrow (~1 ns) pulses to the decoder via the transformer. The \ndecoder is bistable and is therefore either set or reset by the pulses, \nindicating input logic transitions. In the absence of logic transitions \nof more than ~1 μs at the input, a periodic set of refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state is sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses for more than about 5 μs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or \nnonfunctional, in which case the isolator output is forced to a \ndefault state (see Table 17 and Table 18) by the watchdog timer \ncircuit. \nThe ADuM1200/ ADuM1201 are extremely immune to external \nmagnetic fields. The limitation on the magnetic field immunity \nof the ADuM1200 /ADuM1201 is set by the condition in which \ninduced voltage in the receiving coil of the transformer is suf-\nficiently large enough to either falsely set or reset the decoder. \nThe following analysis defines the conditions under which this \ncan occur.  The 3 V operating condition of the ADuM1200 /ADuM1201 is \nexamined because it represents the most susceptible mode of operation. \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0 V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at about 0.5 V , therefore establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages \ncan be tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is \ngiven by \nV = (−dβ/dt )Σ∏r\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N \nwhere: \nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss). \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil. \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm). \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM1200/ \nADuM1201 and an imposed requirement that the induced \nvoltage be 50% at most of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a \nmaximum allowable magnetic field is calculated, as shown in \nFigure 13. \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n04642-013 \nFigure 13. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse (and has the worst-case polarity), it reduces the received pulse from \n>1.0 V to 0.75 V—still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of \nthe decoder. \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances away from the ADuM1200/ ADuM1201 transformers. Figure 14 expresses these \nallowable current magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected distances. As seen, the ADuM1200/ ADuM1201 are \nextremely immune and can be affected only by extremely large \ncurrents operating very close to the component at a high frequency. \nFor the 1 MHz example, place a 0.5 kA current 5 mm away from the ADuM1200 /ADuM1201 to affect the operation of the \ncomponent. \nData Sheet  ADuM1200/ADuM1201 \n \nRev.

Maximum Allowable Current for Various  \nCurrent -to-ADuM1200 /ADuM1201  Spacings  \nNote that, at combi nations of strong magnetic fields and high \nfrequencies, any loops formed by PCB traces can induce suffi -\nciently large error voltages to trigger the threshold of succeeding  \ncircuitry. Take care  in the layout of such traces to avoid this \npossibility.  \nPOWER C ONSUMPTION  \nThe supply current at a given channel of the  ADuM1200 / \nADuM1201 isolator is a function of the supply voltag e, the data \nrate of the channel, and the output load of the channel.  \nFor each input channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDI = IDDI (Q)  f ≤ 0.5 fr \nIDDI = IDDI (D)  × (2f − fr) + I DDI (Q)  f > 0.5 fr \nFor each output channel, the supply current is given by  \nIDDO = IDDO (Q)  f ≤ 0.5 fr \nIDDO = (IDDO (D) + (0.5 × 10−3) × C LVDDO) × (2 f − fr) + IDDO (Q) \n f > 0.5 fr \nwhere:  \nIDDI (D) , IDDO (D)  are the input and output dynamic supply currents \nper channel (mA/Mbps).  \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF).  \nVDDO is the output supply voltage (V).  \nf is the input logic signal frequency (MHz, half of the input data \nrate, NRZ signaling).  \nfr is the input stage refresh rate (Mbps).  \nIDDI (Q) , IDDO (Q)  are the specified input and output quiescent \nsupply currents (mA).  \nTo calculat e the total I DD1 and I DD2 supply currents, the supply \ncurrents for each input and output channel corresponding to \nIDD1 and I DD2 are calculated and totaled. Figure 6 and Figure 7 \nprovide per -channel supply currents as a function of data rate \nfor an unloaded output condition. Figure 8 provides per -\nchannel supply current as a function of data rate for a 15 pF \noutput condition. Figure 9 through Figure 11 provide total  \nVDD1 and V DD2 supply current as a function of data rate for \nADuM1200 and ADuM1201 channel configurations.  INSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected \nto voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insu -\nlation degradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage  \nwaveform applied across the insulation. In addition to the testing \nperformed by the regulatory agencies, Analog Devices carries out an extensive set of evaluations to determine the lifetime of the insulation structure within the  ADuM1200/ ADuM1201.  \nAnalog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage levels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Accel -\neration factors for several operating conditions are  determined. \nThese  factors allow calculation of the time to failure at the actual  \nworking voltage. The values shown in Table 14 summarize the \npeak voltage for 50 years  of service life for a bipolar ac operating \ncondition and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working volt -\nages.  In many cases, the approved working voltage is higher than \nthe 50 -year service life voltage. Operation at these high worki ng \nvoltages can lead to shor tened insulation life in some cases.  \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM1200/ ADuM1201 depends \non the voltage waveform type imposed  across the isolation barrier.  \nThe iCoupler insulation structure degrades at different rates \ndepending on whether the wa veform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, \nor dc. Figure 15\n, Figure 16, and Figure 17 illustrate these different \nisolation voltage waveforms, respectively.  \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. The goal of a 50 -year operating lifetime under the ac bipolar condi tion \ndetermines the Analog Devices recommended maximum \nworking voltage.  \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insu -\nlation is significantly lower, which allows operation at higher \nworking voltages yet still achieves a 50 -year service l ife. The \nworking voltages listed in Table 14 can be applied while main -\ntaining the 50 -year minimum lifetime provided the voltage \nconforms  to either the unipolar ac or  dc voltage cases. Any cross -\ninsulation voltage waveform that does not conform to Figure 16 \nor Figure 17 is to be treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and the \npeak voltage is to be limited to the 50 -year lifetime voltage value \nlisted in  Table 14. \nNote that the voltage presented in Figure 16 is shown as sinu -\nsoidal for illustration purposes only.  It is meant to represent any \nvoltage waveform varying between 0 V and some limiting value. The limiting value can be positive or negative, but the voltage cannot cross 0 V .  \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n04642-021 \nFigure 15. Bipolar AC Waveform  \n \nADuM1200/ADuM1201 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
