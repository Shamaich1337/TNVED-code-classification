Normally, the \nPLL IC noise dominates inside the closed loop bandwidth of the PLL, and the VCO dominates outside the loop band -\nwidth at offsets far from the carrier. Hence a quick estimate of the closed loop performance of the PLL can be made by \nsetting the loop bandwidth equal to the frequency where the PLL and free running phase noise are equal.\nThe Figure of Merit is also useful in estimating the noise parameters to be entered into a closed loop design tool such as \nHittite PLL Design, which can give a much more accurate estimate of the closed loop phase noise and PLL loop filter \ncomponent values.\nGiven an optimum loop design, the approximate closed loop performance is simply given by the minimum of the PLL \nand VCO noise contributions.Φ\n( )0 12 2\n0 0 2\n0,,\ndp p\np m pd\nmfFf Ffff fffΦ= +PLL Phase Noise\nContribution(EQ 1)   \n(EQ 2)   ( )32 2\n0 2 0\n0 23 ,m\nmmFf Ffffffν ν\nνΦ= + VCO Phase Noise\nContribution\nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.

Noise models for each of the components in Hittite PLL Design can be derived from the FOM equations \nor can be provided by Hittite applications engineering.\nSpurious Performance\nInteger Operation\nThe VCO always operates at an integer multiple of the PD frequency in an integer PLL. In general spurious signals \noriginating from an integer PLL can only occur at multiples of the PD frequency. These unwanted outputs are often sim -\nply referred to as reference sidebands. \nspu\nrs unrelated to the reference frequency must originate from outside sources. External spurious sources can modu -\nlate the VCO indirectly through power supplies, ground, or output ports, or bypass the loop filter due to poor isolation of the filter. It can also simply add to the output of the PLL.\nThe HMC704LP4E has been designed and tested for ultra-low spurious performance. Reference spuri\n ou\ns levels are \ntypically below -100 dBc with a well designed board layout. A regulator with low noise and high power supply rejection, \nsuch as the HMC860LP3E, is recommended to minimize external spurious sources.\nReference spurious levels of below -100 dBc require superb board isolation of power supplies, isolation of the VCO \nfrom the digital switching of the PLL and isolation of the VCO load from the PLL. Typical board layout, regulator design, demo boards and application information are available for very low spurious operation. Operation with lower levels of isolation in the application circuit board, from those rec\n om\nmended by Hittite, can result in higher spurious levels.\nOf course, if the application environment contains other interfering frequencies unrelated to the PD fre  qu\nency, and if \nthe application isolation from the board layout and regulation are insufficient, then the unwanted interfering frequencies will mix with the desired PLL output and cause additional spurs. The level of these spurs is dependant upon isolation \nand supply regulation or rejection (P\nsRR\n).\nFractional Operation\nUnlike an integer PLL, spurious signals in a fractional PLL can occur due to the fact that the VCO operates at frequen -\ncies unrelated to the PD frequency. Hence intermodulation of the VCO and the PD harmonics can cause spurious side -\nbands. spu\nrious emissions are largest when the VCO operates very close to an integer multiple of the PD. When the \nVCO operates exactly at a harmonic of the PD then, no in-close mixing products are present.\nInterference is always present at multiples of the PD frequency, fpd, and the VCO frequency, fvco. If the fractional mode \nof operation is used, the difference, Δ,  between the VCO frequency and the nearest har  mo\nnic of the reference, will cre -\nate what are referred to as integer boundary spurs. Depending upon the mode of operation of the PLL, higher order, \nlower power spurs may also occur at multiples of  integer fractions (sub-harmonics) of the PD frequency. That is, frac -\ntional VCO frequencies which are near nfpd + fpdd/m, where n, d and m are all integers and d<m (mathematicians refer \nto d/m as a rational num  be\nr). We will refer to fpdd/m as an integer fraction. The denominator, m, is the order of the spuri -\nous product. Higher values of m produce smaller amplitude spurious at offsets of mΔ and usually when m>4 spurs are very  small or unmeasurable. \nThe worst case, in fractional mode, is when d=0, and the VCO frequency is offset from nf\npd by less than the loop band -\nwidth. This is the “in-band fractional boundary” case.\nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.

Exact levels of the products \nare dependent upon isolation of the various PLL parts. Hittite can offer guidance about expected levels of spurious with our PLL and VCO application boards. Regulators with high power supply rejection ratios (P\nsRR\n) are recommended, \nespecially in noisy applications.\nWhen operating in fractional mode, charge pump and phase detector linearity is of paramount importance. Any non-\nlinearity degrades phase noise and spurious performance. Phase detector linearity degrades when the phase error is very small and is operating back and forth between reference lead and VCO lead. To mitigate these non-linearities in fractional mode it is critical to operate the phase detector with some finite phase offset such that either the reference or VCO always leads. To provide a finite phase error, extra current sources can be enabled which provide a constant DC current path to VDD (VCO leads always) or ground (reference leads always). These current sources are called charge pump offset and they are controlled via “Reg 09h” . The time offset at the phase detector should be ~2.5 ns + 4T\nps, where \nTps is the RF period at the fractional prescaler input in nanoseconds (ie. after the optional fixed divide by 2). The specific \nlevel of charge pump offset current is determined by this time offset, the comparison frequency and the charge pump \ncurrent and can be calculated from:\nCP Offset Current should never be more than 25% of the programmed CP current. Operation with charge pump offset \ninfluences the required configuration of the Lock Detect function. Refer to the description of “PD Window Based Lock Detect”  later in this document. Note that this calculation can be performed for the center frequency of the VCO, and \ndoes not need refinement for small differences (<25%) in center frequencies.\nAnother factor in the spectral performance in Fractional Mode is the choice of the Delta-\nsig\nma Modulator mode.  Mode \nA can offer better in-band spectral performance (inside the loop bandwidth) while Mode B offers better out of band per -\nformance. see \n“Reg 06h” [3:2] for D sM mo\nde selection. Finally, all fractional PLLs cre  at\ne fractional spurs at some level. \nHittite offers the lowest level fractional spurious in the indus  tr\ny in an integrated solution.( )( )9Required CP Offset ( A) = 2.5 10 4 (sec) ( ) ( )PS comparison CP T F Hz I A−µ × + × ×µ (EQ 4)   \nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.

For 50 Ohm match, an external 100 Ohm resistance to ground should be added, followed by an AC coupling ca -\npacitance (impedance < 1 Ohm), then to the XREFP pin of the part. \nAt low frequencies, a relatively square reference is recommended to keep the input slew rate high. At higher frequen -\ncies, a square or sinusoid can be used. The following table shows the recommended operating regions for different \nreference frequencies. If operating outside these regions the part will normally still operate, but with degraded perfor -\nmance.\nMinimum pulse width at the reference buffer input is 2.5 ns. For best spur performance when R = 1, the pulse width \nshould be (2 .5ns + 8 Tps), where Tps is the period of the VCO at the prescaler input. When R > 1 minimum pulse \nwidth is 2.5 ns.\nTable 6.

The reference divider output may be viewed in test mode on the \nLD_sDO p\nin, by setting “Reg 0Fh” [4:0] = 9d.\nRF Path\nThe RF path is shown in Figure 28 . This path features a low noise 8 GHz RF input buffer followed by an 8GHz RF divide-\nby-2 with a selectable bypass. If the VCO input is below 4 GHz the RF divide-by-2 should be by-passed for reduced power consumption and improved performance in fractional mode. The RF divide-by-2 is followed by the N divider, a 19 bit divider that can operate in either integer or fractional mode with up to 4 GHz inputs. Finally the N divider is followed by the Phase Detector (PD), which has two inputs, the RF path from the VCO (V) and the reference path (R) from the crystal. The PD can operate at speeds up to 80 MHz in fractional Mode A, 100 MHz in fractional Mode B and 115 MHz in \ninteger mode. \nRF Input Stage\nThe RF input stage provides the path from the external VCO to the phase detector via the RF or ’N’ divider. The RF input \npath is rated to operate up to 8 GHz across all conditions. The RF input stage is a differential common emitter stage with internal DC bias, and is protected by E\nsD di\nodes as shown in Figure 29 . This input is not matched to 50 Ohms.  A 50 \nOhm resistor placed across the inputs can be used if desired. In most applications the input is used single-ended into either the VCOIP or VCOIN pin with the other input connected to ground through a DC blocking capacitor. The preferred \ninput level for best spectral performance is -10 dBm nominally.\nFigure 29.  RF Input StageFigure 28.

This divider for ex -\nample could divide a 4 GHz input to a PD frequency anywhere between its maximum output limit of 115 MHz to as low \nas 7.6 kHz. The ’N’ divider output may be viewed in test mode on LD_ sDO b\ny set  ti\nng “Reg 0Fh” [4:0] = 10 d. When oper -\nating in fractional mode the N divider can change by up to +/-4 from the average value. Hence the selected divide ratio \nin fractional mode is restricted to values between 2 19-5 (524,283) and 20.\nIf the VCO input is above 4 GHz then the 8 GHz fixed RF divide-by-2 should be used, “Reg 08h” [19] = 1. In this case the \ntotal division range is restricted to even numbers over the range  2*(2 19-5) (1,048,566) to 40.\nCharge Pump and Phase Detector\nThe Phase Detector or PD has two inputs, one from the reference path divider and one from the RF path divider. When \nin lock these two inputs are at the same average frequency and are fixed at a constant aver  ag\ne phase offset with re -\nspect to each other. We refer to the frequency of operation of the PD as fpd. Most formula related to step size, delta-sig -\nma modulation, timers etc., are functions of the operating frequency of the PD, fpd  is sometimes referred to as the com -\nparison frequency of the PD.\nThe PD compares the phase of the RF path signal with that of the reference path signal and controls the charge pump \noutput current as a linear function of the phase difference between the two signals. The out  pu\nt current varies in a linear \nfashion over nearly ±2π radians (±360) of input phase difference.\nPhase Detector and Charge Pump Functions\nPhase detector register “Reg 08h” allows manual access to control special phase detector features.\n“Reg 0Bh” [2:0] allows fine tuning of the PD reset path delay. This adjustment can be used to improve perfor  ma\nnce at \nvery high PD rates. Most often this register is set to the recommended value only.“Reg 06h” [5] and [6] enables the PD UP and DN outputs respectively. Disabling prevents the charge pump from pump -\ning up or down respectively and effectively tri-states the charge pump while leaving all other functions operating inter -\nnally.\nCP Force UP “Reg 08h” [9] and CP Force DN “Reg 00h” [10] allows the charge pump to be forced up or down respec -\ntively. This will force the VCO to the ends of the tuning range which can be useful for testing of the VCO.PD Force Mid “Reg 0Bh” [11]  will disable the charge pump current sources and place a voltage source on the loop filter \nat approximately VPPCP/2. If a passive filter is used this will set the VCO to the mid-voltage tun\n in\ng point which can be \nuseful for testing of the VCO.“Reg 0Bh” [21:7] control other aspects of the phase detector operation and should be set to recommended values.\nPLL Jitter\nThe standard deviation of the arrival time of the VCO signal, or the jitter, may be estimated with a simple approximation \nif we assume that the locked VCO has a constant phase noise, ( )2\n0fΦ , at offsets less than the loop 3 dB bandwidth and \na 20 dB per decade roll off at greater offsets. The simple locked VCO phase noise approximation is shown on the left of \nFigure 30 .\nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.

Clearing “Reg \n07h”[6]=0 will result in a fixed, analog, nominal 10 nsec window, as shown in Figure 31 . The analog window cannot be \nused if the PD rate is very high, for example near 100 MHz, or if the charge pump offset current results in an offset larger than 7 nsec.\nFor example a 25 MHz PD rate with a 1mA charge pump setting ( “Reg 09h” [6:0]= ”Reg 09h” [13:7]= 50d) and a -400uA \noffset current “Reg 09h” [20:14]=80d), would have a phase offset of about 400/1000 = 40% of the PD period or about  \n16 nsec. In such an extreme case the divided VCO would arrive 16 ns after the PD ref\n er\nence, and would always arrive \noutside of the 10 nsec lock detect window. In such a case the lock detect circuit would always read unlocked, even \nthough the VCO might be locked. The charge pump current, reference period, charge pump offset current, and lock \ndetect win  do\nw are related.\nDigital Window Lock Detect\nsetting “Reg 07h” [ 6]=1 will result in a variable length lock detect window based upon the internal digital timer. The one \nshot timer period is controlled by “Reg 07h” [11:10]. The resulting lock detect window period is then generated by the \nnumber of timer periods defined in “Reg 07h” [9:7]. \nDeclaration of Lock\n“Reg 07h” [2:0] defines the number of consecutive counts of the divided VCO that must land inside the lock detect win -\ndow to declare lock. If for example we set “Reg 07h” [2:0] =5 then the VCO arrival would have to occur inside the widow \n2048 times in a row to be declared locked, which would result in a Lock Detect Flag high. A single occurrence outside of \nthe window will result in an out of lock, i.e. Lock Detect Flag low. Once low, the Lock Detect Flag will stay low until the lkd_wincnt_max = 2048 condition is met again.\nThe Lock Detect Flag status is always readable in “Reg 12h” [1]. Lock Detect status is also output to the LD_\nsDO p\nin if \n“Reg 0Fh” [4:0]=1, “Reg 0Fh” [6]=1 and “Reg 0Fh” [7]=1. Clearing ”Reg 0Fh” [6]=0 will display the Lock Detect Flag on \nLD_sDO e\nxcept when a serial port read is requested, in which case the pin reverts temporarily to the ser\nial Data Out \npin and returns to the Lock Detect Flag after the read is completed.

The phase detector linearity degrades when operated with zero phase offset. Hence in fractional mode it \nis necessary to offset the phase of the reference and VCO at the phase detector. In such a case, for example with an offset delay, as shown in Figure 32 , the VCO arrival may always occur after the reference. The lock detect circuit win -\ndow may need to be adjusted to allow for the delay being used, if the delay is large.\nVCO AT PD with FRAC JitterLOCK\nDETECT\nWINDOWTwindow  ~ +10nsec\nFigure 32.

Then our average offset at the PD will be 0.4 mA/2 mA = 0.2 of the PD period or about 4 ns (0.2 x 1/50 MHz). However, the fractional modulation of the VCO divider will result in time excursions of the VCO divider output of +/-4Tvco (assuming the internal 8 GHz Divide-by-2 is not enabled. \nsee R\neg 8 Bit [19]) from this average value  \n(+/-1.5ns in this example). Hence when in lock, the divided VCO will arrive at the PD about 4 +/-1.5 ns after the divided reference. The Lock Detect window always starts on the arrival of the first signal at the PD, in this case the reference.

A perfect Lock Detect window would be midway between these two values, or 12.75 ns.\nTolerance on the window is +25% at +85 C, -25% at -40 C. Here 12.8 ns nominal window may extend by +25% at +85C \nto 16 ns, which is fine for a PD period of 20 ns. Also the minimum window may shrink by 25% to 9.6ns at -40C, which again works well for the DC offset of 5.5 ns.\nThere is always a good solution for the lock detect window for a given operating point. The user should understand \nhowever that one solution does not fit all operating points. If charge pump offset or PD fre\n qu\nency are changed signifi -\ncantly then the lock detect window may need to be adjusted.\nCycle Slip Prevention (CSP)\nWhen changing frequency and the VCO is not yet locked to the reference, the instantaneous frequencies of the two PD inputs are different, and the phase difference of the two inputs at the PD varies rapidly over a range much greater than +/-2π radians. \nsin\nce the gain of the PD varies linearly with phase up to +/-2π, the gain of a conventional PD will cycle \nfrom high gain, when the phase difference approaches a multiple of 2π, to low gain, when the phase difference is slightly larger than 0 radians. The output current from the charge pump will cycle from maximum to minimum even though the VCO has not yet reached its final frequency.\nThe charge on the loop filter small cap may actually discharge slightly during the low gain portion of the cycle. This can \nmake the VCO frequency actually reverse temporarily during locking. This phenomenon is known as cycle slipping.  Cycle slipping causes the pull-in rate during the locking phase to vary cyclically. Cycle \nsli\npping increases the time to \nlock to a value much greater than that predicted by normal small signal Laplace analysis.\nThe PLL PD features an ability to reduce cycle slipping during acquisition. The Cycle sli\np Preven  ti\non (C sP) f\neature in -\ncreases the PD gain during large phase errors.  The specific phase error that triggers the  momentary increase in PD \ngain is set via “Reg 0Bh” [8:7].\nPD PolarityRef at PD\nVCO at PD\nLD WINDOWPD Period 20ns\nVCO Offset 4ns\nLD Window 12.8 ns+/-25%\n+Window Margin-Window Margin\nFigure 33.

The product of VCO gain (Kvco) and \ncharge pump gain (Kcp) can be held constant for VCO’s that have a wide ranging Kvco by adjusting the charge pump \ngain.  This compensation helps to keep the loop bandwidth constant.\nIn addition to the normal CP current as described above, there is also an extra output source of current that offers im -\nproved noise performance. HiKcp provides an output current that is proportional to the loop filter voltage. This being the \ncase HiKcp should only be operated with active op-amp loop filters that define the voltage as seen by the charge pump \npin.  With 2.5V as observed at the charge pump pin, the HiKcp current is 3.5 mA.\nThere are several configurations that could be used with the HiKcp feature.  For lowest  noise, HiKcp could be used with -\nout the normal charge pump current (the charge pump current would be set to 0).  In this case, the loop filter would be \ndesigned with 3.5 mA as the effective charge pump current.\nAnother possible configuration is to operate with both the HiKcp and normal charge pump current sources.  In this case \nthe effective charge pump current would be 3.5 mA + programmed normal charge pump current which could offer a \nmaximum of 6 mA.\nWith passive loop filters the voltage seen by the charge pump pin will vary which would cause the HiKcp current to vary \nwidely.  As such, HiKcp should not be used on passive loop filter implementations.\nA simplified diagram of the charge pump is shown in Figure 34 . The current gain of the pump in Amps/radian is \nequal to the gain setting of this register divided by 2π.\nCharge Pump Offset\n“Reg 09h” [20:14]  controls the charge pump current offsets. “Reg 09h” [21] and “Reg 09h” [22] enable the UP and DN \noffset currents respectively. Normally only one is used at a time. As mentioned earlier charge pump offsets affect \nfractional mode linearity and the Lock Detect window selection.\nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.

For example a 24 bit fractional modulator has frequency resolution set by the phase detector (PD ) \ncomparison rate divided by 2 24. In the case of a 50MHz PD rate, this would be approximately 2.98 Hz, or 0.0596 ppm.\nIn some applications it is necessary to have exact frequency steps, and even an error of 3Hz cannot be tol  er\nated.  \nIn some fractional PLLs it is necessary to shorten the length of the accumulator (the denominator or the modulus) to  \naccommodate the exact period of the step size. The shortened accumula  tor \noften leads to very high spurious levels  \nat multiples of the channel spacing, fstep = fPD/Modulus. For example 200kHz channel steps with a 10MHz PD rate  \nrequires a modulus of just 50. The HMC method achieves the exact frequency step size while using the full 24 bit modu -\nlus, thus achiev  in\ng exact frequency steps with very low spurious and a high comparison rate, which maintains excellent \nphase noise.\nExact frequency steps can be achieved only when the PD rate and the desired frequency step size are related by an  \ninteger multiple. More precisely, the greatest common divisor, (GCD) of the PD rate and the desired frequency step size \nmust be an integer, and that integer must be less than 2 14-1 or 16,383.\nAs an example suppose that we want to achieve:\na. Ex\nact channel step size of fstep= 100kHz.\nb. Re\nference Crystal fxtal  = 61.44MHz\nc. Ph\nase Detector (PD) Rate fpd  =61.44MHz\nd.

It is important that this parameter be \nrounded up (hence the ‘ceiling’ function).\nThe fractional value is programmed for each new channel. The integer value is only programmed initially and then only \nif the output crosses an integer boundary.\nSeed Register and AutoSeed Mode\nThe start phase of the fractional modulator digital phase accumulator (DPA) may be set to one of four pos -\nsible default values via the seed register “Reg 06h” [1:0]. If autoseed “Reg 06h”[8] is set, then the PLL will automatically \nreload the start phase from “Reg 06h” [1:0] into the DPA every time a new fractional fre  qu\nency is selected. If autoseed is \nnot set, then the PLL will start new fractional frequencies with the value left in the DPA from the last frequency. Hence \nthe start phase will effectively be random. Certain zero or binary seed values may cause spurious energy correlation at specific frequencies. Correlated spurs are advantageous only in very special cases where the spurious are known to be far out of band and are removed in the loop filter. For most cases a pseudo-random seed setting ( “Reg 06h” [1:0] =2 \nor 3) is recom\n me\nnded. Further, since the autoseed always starts the accumulators at the same place, performance is \nrepeatable if autoseed is used. “Reg 06h” [1:0]=2  is recommended.\nPower on Reset\nThe HMC704LP4E features a hardware Power on Reset (POR) on the digital supply DVDD. All chip reg  is ters will be \nreset to default states approximately 250 us after power up  of DVDD. Once the supply is fully up, if the power supply \nthen drops below 0.5V the digital portion will reset.\nPower Down Mode\nHardware Power Down \nChip enable may be controlled from the hardware CEN pin 23, or it may be controlled from the serial port. “Reg 01h” [0] \n=1 assigns control to the CEN pin. “Reg 01h” [0] =0 assigns control to the serial port “Reg 01h” [1]. For hardware test \nreasons or some special applications it is possible to force certain blocks to remain on inside the chip , even if the chip \nis disabled. see\n the register “Reg 01h”  description for more details.\nChip Identification\nVersion information may be read from the PLL by reading the content of chip_ID in “Reg 00h” .\nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.

During any Open Mode sPI c\nycle \nLD_sDO w\nill contain the data from the current address written in “Reg 00h” [4:0]. If “Reg 00h” [4:0] is not changed then \nthe same data will always be present on LD_ sDO w\nhen an Open Mode cycle is in progress. If it is desired to READ from \na specific address, it is necessary in the first sPI c\nycle to write the desired address to “Reg 00h” [4:0], then in the next \nsPI c\nycle the desired data will be available on LD_ sDO\n.\nAn example of the Open Mode two cycle procedure to read from any random address is as follows:\na. Th\ne Master (host), on the first 24 falling edges of sCL\nK places 24 bit data, d23:d0, M sB fir\nst, on sDI \na\ns shown in Figure 39 . d23:d5 should be set to zero. d4:d0 = address of the register to be READ on \nthe next cycle.\nb. th\ne slave (PLL) shifts in data on sDI o\nn the  first 24 rising edges of sCL\nK\nc. Ma\nster places 5 bit register address , r4:r0, ( the address the READ ADDRE ss r\negister), M sB fir\nst, \non the next 5 falling edges of sCL\nK (23-29). r4:r0=00000.\nd. sla\nve shifts the register bits on the next 5 rising edges of sCL\nK (23-29).\ne. Ma\nster places 3 bit chip address, a2:a0, M sB fir\nst, on the next 3 falling edges of sCL\nK (30-32).Chip \naddress is always 000 for RF PLL-VCOs.\nf. sla\nve shifts the chip address bits on the next 3 rising edges of sCL\nK (30-32).\ng. Ma\nster asserts sEN af\nter the 32nd rising edge of sCL\nK.\nh. sla\nve registers the sDI d\nata on the rising edge of sEN\n.\ni. Ma\nster clears sEN to c\nomplete the address transfer of the two part READ cycle.\nj. If w\ne do not wish to write data to the chip at the same time as we do the second cycle , then it is \nrecommended to simply rewrite the same contents on sDI to R\negister zero on the READ back part \nof the cycle.\nk. Ma\nster places the same sDI d\nata as the previous cycle on the next 32 falling edges of sCL\nK.\nl. sla\nve (PLL) shifts the sDI d\nata on the next 32 rising edges of sCL\nK.\nm. sla\nve places the desired data (i.e. data from address  in “Reg 00h” [4:0 ]) on LD_ sDO o\nn the next 32 \nrising edges of sCL\nK. Lock Detect is disabled.\nn. Ma\nster asserts sEN af\nter the 32nd rising edge of sCL\nK to complete the cycle and revert back to \nLock Detect on LD_ sDO\n.\nNote that if the chip address bits are unrecognized (a2:a0), the slave will tri-state the LD_ sDO o\nutput to prevent a pos -\nsible contention issue.\nTable 12.
