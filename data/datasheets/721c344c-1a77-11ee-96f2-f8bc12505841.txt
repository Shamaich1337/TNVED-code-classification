Integrated hot-swap functionality elimi -\nnates false transitions on the bus during power-up or hot \ninsertion.\nThe device features fail-safe receiver inputs guaranteeing \na logic-high receiver output when inputs are shorted or \nopen. The IC has a 1-unit load receiver input impedance, \nallowing up to 32 transceivers on the bus.\nTrue Fail Safe\nThe MAX14783E guarantees a logic-high receiver output \nwhen the receiver inputs are shorted or open, or when \nthey are connected to a terminated transmission line with \nall drivers disabled. If the differential receiver input voltage \n(A–B) is greater than or equal to -10mV, RO is logic-high.\nDriver Single-Ended Operation\nThe A and B outputs can either be used in the standard \ndifferential operating mode, or can be used as single-\nended outputs. Since the A and B driver outputs swing \nrail-to-rail, they can individually be used as standard TTL \nlogic outputs.Hot-Swap Capability\nHot-Swap Inputs\nWhen circuit boards are inserted in a hot or powered \nbackplane, disturbances on the enable inputs and dif -\nferential receiver inputs can lead to data errors. Upon \ninitial circuit board insertion, the processor undergoes its \npower-up sequence. During this period, the processor \noutput drivers are high impedance and are unable to drive \nthe DE and RE inputs of the MAX14783E to a defined \nlogic level. Leakage currents up to 10µA from the high-\nimpedance outputs of a controller could cause DE and RE \nto drift to an incorrect logic state.  Additionally, parasitic \ncircuit board capacitance could cause coupling of V CC \nor GND to DE and RE. These factors could improperly \nenable the driver or receiver. The MAX14783E features \nintegrated hot-swap inputs that help to avoid these poten -\ntial problems.\nWhen V CC rises, an internal pulldown circuit holds DE \nlow and RE high. After the initial power-up sequence, the \npulldown circuit becomes transparent, resetting the hot-\nswap-tolerable inputs.\nHot-Swap Input Circuitry\nThe DE and RE enable inputs feature hot-swap capabil -\nity. At the input, there are two nMOS devices, M1 and M2 \n(Figure 9). When V CC ramps from 0V, an internal 10µs \ntimer turns on M2 and sets the SR latch that also turns \nFigure 9.

Transistors M2 (a 500µA current sink) and M1 (a \n100µA current sink) pull DE to GND through a 5kΩ (typ) \nresistor. M2 is designed to pull DE to the disabled state \nagainst an external parasitic capacitance up to 100pF that \ncan drive DE high. After 10µs, the timer deactivates M2 \nwhile M1 remains on, holding DE low against three-state \nleakages that can drive DE high. M1 remains on until an \nexternal source overcomes the required input current. \nAt this time, the SR latch resets and M1 turns off. When \nM1 turns off, DE reverts to a standard, high-impedance \nCMOS input. Whenever V CC drops below 1V, the hot-\nswap input is reset.\nA complementary circuit employing two pMOS devices \npulls RE to V CC.\n±35kV ESD Protection\nESD protection structures are incorporated on all pins \nto protect against electrostatic discharges encountered \nduring handling and assembly. The driver outputs and \nreceiver inputs of the MAX14783E have extra protection \nagainst static electricity. The ESD structures withstand \nhigh ESD in all states: normal operation, shutdown, and \npowered down. After an ESD event, the MAX14783E \nkeeps working without latch-up or damage.\nESD protection can be tested in various ways. The trans -\nmitter outputs and receiver inputs of the MAX14783E are \ncharacterized for protection to the following limits:● ±35kV HBM\n● ±20kV using the Air-Gap Discharge method specified \nin IEC 61000-4-2\n● ±12kV using the Contact Discharge method specified \nin IEC 61000-4-2\nESD Test Conditions\nESD performance depends on a variety of conditions. \nContact Maxim for a reliability report that documents test \nsetup, test methodology, and test results.\nHuman Body Model (HBM)\nFigure 10 shows the HBM, and Figure 11 shows the cur -\nrent waveform it generates when discharged into a low-\nimpedance state. This model consists of a 100pF capaci -\ntor charged to the ESD voltage of interest, which is then \ndischarged into the test device through a 1.5kΩ resistor.\nIEC 61000-4-2\nThe IEC 61000-4-2 standard covers ESD testing and per -\nformance of finished equipment. However, it does not spe -\ncifically refer to integrated circuits. The MAX14783E helps \nin designing equipment to meet IEC 61000-4-2 without the \nneed for additional ESD protection components.\nThe major difference between tests done using the HBM \nand IEC 61000-4-2 is higher peak current in IEC 61000-\n4-2 because series resistance is lower in the IEC 61000-\n4-2 model. Hence, the ESD withstand voltage measured \nto IEC 61000-4-2 is generally lower than that measured \nusing the HBM.\nFigure 10. Human Body ESD Test Model Figure 11.
