This passive monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) mixer is fabricated in a gallium arsenide (GaAs) metal semiconductor \nfield effect transistor (MESFET) process and requires no \nexternal components or matching circuitry. The device can be used as an upconverter, downconverter, biphase demodulator, \nor phase comparator from 2.5 GHz to 7.0 GHz. The HMC219B provides excellent local oscillator (LO) to radio \nfrequency (RF) isolation and LO to intermediate frequency (IF) \nisolation due to optimized balun structures. The RoHS compliant HMC219B eliminates the need for wire bonding and is compatible with high volume surface-mount manufacturing techniques. The \nconsistent MMIC performance improves system operation and \nassures regulatory compliance with HiperLAN, U-NII, and ISM. 1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5GND\nRF\nIFGNDGND\nLO\nNICGNDHMC219B\n15452-001\nHMC219B  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

A | Page 25 of 27 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe HMC219B  is a general -purpose, double  balanced mixer in \nan 8-lead, MINI_SO_EP , RoHS -compliant package that can be \nused as an upconverter or a downconverter from 2.5  GHz to \n7.0 GHz .  \nWhen used a downconverter, the HMC 219B  downconverts RF \nbetween 2.5 GHz and 7.0  GHz to IF  between dc and 3  GHz.  When used as an upconverter, the mixer upconverts IF  between \ndc and 3  GHz to  RF between 2.5 GHz and 7.0  GHz.  \nThe mixer provides excellent LO to RF and LO to IF isolation  \ndue to optimized balun structures. The HMC 219B  requires no \nexternal components or matching circuitry. The RoHS compliant \nHMC219B  eliminates the need for wire bonding and is compatible  \nwith high volume, surface -mount manufacturing  techniques.  \n \n \n \nHMC219B  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 26 of 27 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nTYPICAL APPLICATION CIRCUIT  \nFigure 83 shows the typical application circuit for the HMC 219B . \nThe HMC 219B  is a passive device and does not require any \nexternal components. The LO and RF pins are internally \ndc-coupled. When IF operation  is not required until dc, use an \nac-coupled capacitor at the IF port. When IF operation to dc is \nrequired, do  not exceed the I F source and sink  the current rating \nspec ified in the  Absolute  Maximum  Ratings  section . \n \nFigure 83. Typical Application Circuit  EVALUATION  PCB INFORMATION \nRF circuit design techniques must be implemented for the evaluation board PCB shown in Figure 84. Signal lines must \nhave 50 Ω impedanc e, and the package ground leads and \nexposed pad must  connect  directly to the ground plane, similar to \nwhat is  shown in Figure 84. Use a sufficient num ber of via holes \nto connect the top and bottom ground planes. The evaluation circuit board shown in Figure 84 is available from Analog \nDevices, Inc., u pon request.

#### Description:
The HMC219B is an ultraminiature, general-purpose, double balanced mixer designed for operation in the frequency range of 2.5 GHz to 7.0 GHz. It is fabricated using a gallium arsenide (GaAs) metal semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET) process. This mixer can function as both an upconverter and downconverter, making it versatile for various RF applications. The device is packaged in an 8-lead plastic surface mount package with an exposed pad, facilitating efficient thermal management and ease of integration into high-volume manufacturing processes.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Microwave Radios**: Used in communication systems for signal processing.
- **High-Performance Radio Local Area Networks (HiperLAN)**: Facilitates high-speed wireless communication.
- **Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)**: Supports wireless broadband applications.
- **Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) Applications**: Utilized in various industrial and medical devices requiring RF signal processing.

The HMC219B is particularly noted for its low conversion loss (typically 9 dB), high isolation levels (LO to RF isolation of 40 dB, LO to IF isolation of 35 dB), and robust performance metrics, making it suitable for demanding RF applications.
