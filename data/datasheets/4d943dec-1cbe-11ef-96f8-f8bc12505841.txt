GENERAL DESCRIPTION S \nThe W25 Q128FW  (128M-bit) Serial Flash memory  provide s a storage solution for systems with limited \nspace, pins and power. The 25 Q series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash \ndevices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM,  executing code directly from D ual/Quad SPI  (XIP) \nand storing voice, text and data. The device operate s on a single 1.65V to 1.95V power supply with current \nconsumption as low as 4mA a ctive and 1µA for power -down. All devices are of fered in space -saving \npackages.  \nThe W25 Q128FW  array is organized into 65,536 programmable pages of 256 -bytes each. Up to 256 \nbytes can be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 ( 4KB sector erase), groups of \n128 (32KB block erase), groups of 256 ( 64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The \nW25 Q128FW  has 4,096  erasable sectors and 256 erasable blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors \nallow for greater flexibility in applications t hat require data and parameter storage. (See Figure  2.)  \nThe W25 Q128FW  support  the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O  SPI as well as 2 -\nclocks instruction cycle Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) : Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I /O0 (DI), \nI/O1 (DO), I/O2 (/WP), and I/O3 (/HOLD) . SPI clock frequencies of up to 104MHz are supported allowing \nequivalent clock rates of 208MHz ( 104MHz x 2) for Dual I/O and 416MHz ( 104MHz x 4) for Quad I/O when \nusing the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O and QPI instructions.  These transfer rates can outperform standard \nAsynchronous  8 and 16 -bit Parallel Flash memories. The Continuous Read Mode allows for efficient \nmemory access with as few as 8 -clocks of instruction -overhead to read a 24 -bit address, allowing true  XIP \n(execute  in place) operation.   \nA Hold pin, Write Protect pin and programmable write protect ion, with top or bottom array control , provide  \nfurther control flexibility. Additionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID, a \n64-bit Unique Serial Number  and three  256-bytes Security Registers . \n2.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \n4.1 Chip Select (/CS)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (/CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS  is high the device is \ndeselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3) pins are at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devi ces power consumption will be at standby levels unless an internal erase, program or \nwrite status register cycle is in progress. When /CS  is brought low the device will be selected, power \nconsumption will increase to active levels and instructions can be w ritten to and data read from the device. \nAfter power -up, /CS  must transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The /CS \ninput must track the VCC supply level at power -up (see “Write Protection” and Figure 58). If needed a pull -\nup resister on the /CS pin can be used to accomplish this.  \n4.2 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)   \nThe W25 Q128FW  supports standard SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI instructions \nuse the unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the \nrising edge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO (output) to \nread data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual and Quad SPI instructions use the bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses or \ndata to the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of \nCLK. Quad SPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad  Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.  \nWhen QE=1, the /WP pin becomes IO2 and /HOLD pin becomes IO3.  \n4.3 Write Protect (/WP)  \nThe Write Protect (/WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the Sta tus Register’s Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits and Status \nRegister Protect (SRP) bits, a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory array can be \nhardware protected. The /WP pin is active low. When the QE bit of Status Registe r-2 is set for Quad I/O, \nthe /WP pin function is not available since this pin is used for IO2. See Figure 1a -c for the pin \nconfiguration of Quad I/O operation.  \n4.4 HOLD (/HOLD)  \nThe /HOLD pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. When /H OLD is brought low, \nwhile /CS  is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and CLK pins will be ignored \n(don’t care). When /HOLD is brought high, device operation can resume. The  /HOLD  function can be \nuseful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals. The /HOLD pin is active low. When the \nQE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the /HOLD pin function is not available since this pin is \nused for IO3. See Figure 1a -c for the pin configuration of Quad I/O operation.  \n4.5 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations. ("See SPI \nOperations")  \n4.6 Reset (/RESET)  \nThe /RESET pin allows the device to be reset by the controller. For 8 -pin packages, when QE=0, the IO3 \npin can be configured either as a /HOLD pin or as a /RESET pin depending on Status Register setting. \nWhen QE=1, the /HOLD or /RESET function is not available for 8 -pin configuration. On the 16 -pin SOIC \npackage, a dedicated /RESET pin is provided and it is i ndependent of QE bit setting.  \nW25Q 128FW   \n \n \n- 11 - 5. BLOCK DIAGRAM  \nFigure 2.

W25 Q128FW  Serial Flash Memory Operation Diagram  \n \n6.1.1  Standard SPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q128FW  is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock \n(CLK), Chip Select ( /CS), Serial Data Input  (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard SPI instructio ns \nuse the DI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of \nCLK. The  DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling edge  of CLK.  \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and \nMode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is \nnot being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0 , the CLK signal is normally low  on the falling a nd \nrising edges of /CS.  For Mode 3 , the CLK signal is normally high  on the falling and rising edges of /CS .  \n6.1.2  Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q128FW  support s Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as  “Fast Read Dual Output  \n(3Bh)”  and “Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) ”. These instructions  allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice  at two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices.  The Dual SPI Read instruction s are \nideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -shadowing) o r for execut ing non-speed -\ncritical  code directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructions , the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional I/ O pins:  IO0 and IO1.  \nW25Q 128FW   \n \n \n- 13 - 6.1.3  Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q128FW  supports Quad  SPI operation whe n using instruction s such as  “Fast Read Quad  Output  \n(6Bh) ”, “Fast Read  Quad  I/O (EBh) ”, “Word Read Quad I/O  (E7h) ” and “Octal Word Read Quad I/O  \n(E3h) ”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the device four to six times the rate of \nordinary Serial Flash.  The Quad Read instructions offer a significant improvement in continuous  and \nrandom access transfer rates allowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or execution directly from the SPI bus \n(XIP) . When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins become bidirect ional IO0 and IO1 , and the \n/WP and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 respectively. Quad SPI instructions require the non -volatile \nQuad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set . \n6.1.4  QPI Instructions  \nThe W25 Q128FW  supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) opera tions  only when the device is switched \nfrom Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the “ Enter QPI  (38h)” instruction.  The typical SPI \nprotocol requires that the byte-long instruction code being shifted into the device only via DI pin in eight \nserial  clocks. The QPI mode utilizes all four IO pins to input the instruction code, thus only two serial \nclocks are required. This can significantly reduce the SPI instruction overhead and improve system \nperformance in an XIP environment. Standard/Dual/Quad SPI  mode and QPI mode are exclusive. Only \none mode can be active at any given time. “ Enter QPI  (38h)” and “ Exit QPI  (FFh)” instructions are used to \nswitch between these two modes. Upon power -up or after a software reset using “Reset (99h)” instruction , \nthe default state of the device is  Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode.  To enable QPI mode, the non -volatile \nQuad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 is required to be set.  When using QPI instructions, the DI and \nDO pins become bidirectional IO0 and IO1, and the /WP an d /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 \nrespectively.  See Figure 3 for the device operation modes.  \n6.1.5  Hold Function  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, t he /HOLD  signal allows the W25 Q128FW  operation to be \npaused while it is actively selected (when /CS is low).  The /HOLD  function may be useful in cases where \nthe SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For example, consider if the page buffer \nwas only partially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the SPI bus. In this case the  /HOLD  \nfunction can save the state of the instruction and the data in the buffer so programming can resume where \nit left off once the bus is available again.  The /HOLD function is only available for standard SPI and Dual \nSPI operation, not during Quad SPI  or QPI . The Quad Enable Bit QE in Status Register -2 is used to \ndetermine if the pin is used as /HOLD pin or data I/O pin. When QE=0 (factory default), the pin is /HOLD, \nwhen QE=1, the pin will become an I/O pin, /HOLD function is no longer available.  \nTo initiate  a /HOLD  condition, the device must be selected with /CS low. A  /HOLD  condition will activate on \nthe falling edge of the /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the  \n/HOLD  condition will activate after the next falling e dge of CLK. The  /HOLD  condition will terminate on the \nrising edge of the  /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the  /HOLD  \ncondition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK.  During a  /HOLD  condition, the Seria l Data \nOutput (DO) is high impedance, a nd Serial Data Input (DI ) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip \nSelect ( /CS) signal should be kept active (low) for the full duration of the  /HOLD  operation to avoid \nresetting the internal logic state of the de vice. \n \n W25Q 128FW   \n \nPublication Release Date:  May 18, 2017  \n- 14 -                                     Revision K  6.1.6  Software Reset & Hardware /RESET pin  \nThe W25 Q128FW  can be reset to the initial power -on state by a software Reset sequence, either in SPI \nmode or QPI mode. This sequence must include two consecutive commands: Enable Reset (66h) & \nReset (99h). If th e command sequence is successfully accepted, the device will take approximately 30uS \n(tRST) to reset. No command will be accepted during the reset period.  \nFor the 8-pin and TFBGA package types, W25 Q128FW  can also be configured to utilize a hardware \n/RESET pin. The HOLD/RST bit in the Status Register -3 is the configuration bit for /HOLD pin function or \nRESET pin function. When HOLD/RST=0 (factory default), the pin acts as a /HOLD pin as described \nabove; when HOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as a /RESET pin. Drive th e /RESET pin low for a minimum period \nof ~1us (tRESET*) will reset the device to its initial power -on state. Any on -going Program/Erase operation \nwill be interrupted and data corruption may happen. While /RESET is low, the device will not accept any \ncomman d input.  \nIf QE bit is set to 1 on the 8 -pin packages, the /HOLD or /RESET function will be disabled, the pin will \nbecome one of the four data I/O pins.  \n \nFor the SOIC -16 package, W25Q128FW provides a dedicated /RESET pin in addition to the /HOLD (IO 3) \npin a s illustrated in Figure 1b. Drive the /RESET pin low for a minimum period of ~1us (tRESET*) will reset \nthe device to its initial power -on state. The HOLD/RST bit or QE bit in the Status Register will not affect \nthe function of this dedicated /RESET pin.  \n \nHardware /RESET pin has the highest priority among all the input signals. Drive /RESET low for a \nminimum period of ~1us (tRESET*) will interrupt any on -going external/internal operations, regardless the \nstatus of other SPI signals (/CS, CLK, IOs, /WP and/or  /HOLD).  \n \nNote:   \n1. While a faster /RESET pulse (as short as a few hundred nanoseconds) will often reset the device, a 1us minimum is \nrecommended to ensure reliable operation.  \n2. There is an internal pull -up resistor for the dedicated /RESET pin on the SOIC -16 package. If the reset function is not needed, \nthis pin can be left floating in the system . \n \n \nW25Q 128FW   \n \n \n- 15 - 6.2 Write Protection  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and other \nadverse system conditions that may compr omise data integrity. To address this concern , the \nW25 Q128FW  provides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n6.2.1  Write Protect Features  \n \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf0b7 Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions  and a utomatic write disable after e rase or program  \n\uf0b7 Software and Hardware (/WP pin) write p rotection using Status Registers  \n\uf0b7 Additional Individual Block/Sector Locks for array protection  \n\uf0b7 Write Protection using Power -down instruction   \n\uf0b7 Lock Down w rite protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf0b7 One Time Program (OTP) write protection for array and Security Register s using Status Register* \n* Note : This feature  is available upon special order. Please contact Winbond for details.  \n \nUpon powe r-up or at power -down , the W25 Q128FW  will maintain a reset condition while VCC is below the \nthreshold value of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 43). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the VCC voltage \nexceeds V WI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time delay of t PUW. This \nincludes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and the Write Status \nRegister inst ructions. Note that the chip select pin ( /CS) must track the VCC supply level at power -up until \nthe VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached.  \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status Register Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instruction must be issued before a Page Program, Sector \nErase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will be accepted. After completing a \nprogram, erase or write instruction the Write Enab le Latch (WEL) is automatically cleared to a write -\ndisabled state of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and setting the \nStatus Register Protect (SRP 0, SRP1 ) and Block Protect ( CMP , SEC, TB, BP[2:0]) bits. These settings  \nallow a portion or the entire  memory  array  to be configured as read only. Used in conjunction with the \nWrite Protect ( /WP) pin, changes to the Status Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware \ncontrol. See Status Registe r section for further information.  Additionally, the Power -down instruction offers \nan extra level of write protection as all instructions are ignored except for the Release Power -down \ninstruction.  \nThe W25 Q128FW  also provides another Write Protect method us ing the Individual Block Locks.  Each \n64KB block  (except the top and bot tom blocks , total of 510 blocks ) and each 4KB sector  within the \ntop/bottom blocks (total of 32 sectors) are equipped with an Individual Block Lock bit. When the lock bit is \n0, the corre sponding sector or block can be erased or programmed; when the lock bit is set to 1, Erase or \nProgram commands issued to the corresponding sector or block will be ignored. When the device is \npowered on, all Individual Block Lock bits will be 1, so the enti re memory array is protected  from \nErase/Program. An “Individual Block Unl ock (39h)” instruction must be issued to unlock any specific sector \nor block.  \nThe WPS bit in Status Register -3 is used to decide which Write Protect scheme should be used. When \nWPS=0 (factory default), the device  will only utilize CMP, SEC, TB, BP[2 :0] bits to protect specific areas of \nthe arra y; when WPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual Block Locks for write protection.  \n W25Q 128FW   \n \nPublication Release Date:  May 18, 2017  \n- 16 -                                     Revision K  7. STATUS  AND CONFIGURATION  REGISTERS  \nThree Status and Con figuration Registers are provided for W25 Q128FW . The Read Status Register -1/2/3 \ninstruction s can be used to provide sta tus on the availability of the flash memory array, whether  the device \nis write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection , Quad S PI setting, Security Register lock status,  \nErase/Program Suspend status , output driver strength, power -up. The Write Status Register instruction \ncan be used to configure the device  write protection features , Quad SPI sett ing, Security Register OTP lock s, \nHold/Reset functions, output driver strength . Write access to the Status Register is controlled by the state of \nthe non-volatile  Status Register Protect bits (SRP 0, SRP1 ), the Write Enable instruction, and during \nStandard/Dual SPI operations, the /WP pin .  \n7.1 Status Registers  \nS7 S6 S5 S4 S3 S2 S1 S0\nSRP0SEC TB BP2 BP1 BP0 WELBUSY\nStatus Register Protect 0\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\nTop/Bottom Protect Bit\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\nBlock Protect Bits\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\nWrite Enable Latch\n(Status-Only)\nErase/Write In Progress\n(Status-Only)Sector Protect Bit\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\n \nFigure 4 a. Status Register -1 \n7.1.1  Erase/Write In Progress ( BUSY ) – Status Only   \nBUSY is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is executing a \nPage Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register or \nErase/Program Security Register instruction. During this time the device will ignore further instructions \nexcept for the Read Status Register and Erase /Program  Suspend instruction (see t W, tPP, tSE, tBE, and \ntCE in AC Characteristics). When the program, erase or write status /security  register instruction has \ncompleted, the BUSY bit will be cleared to a 0 state indicating the device is ready for further instructions.   \n7.1.2  Write Enable Latch (WEL)  – Status Only  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the statu s register (S1) that is set to  1 after executing a \nWrite Enable Instruction. Th e WEL status bit is cleared to  0 when the device is write disabled. A write \ndisable state occurs upon power -up or after any of the following instructions: Write Disable, Page \nProgram, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase,  Write Status Register , Erase \nSecurity Register and Program Security Register . \n7.1.3  Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writ able \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4, S3, and \nS2) that provide Write Protection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using the Write Status \nRegister Instruction (see t W in AC c haracteristics). All, none or a portion of the memory array can be \nprotected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory Protection table). The \nfactory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protected.   \nW25Q 128FW   \n \n \n- 17 - 7.1.4  Top/Bottom Block Protect  (TB) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe non-volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect from the \nTop (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protec tion table. \nThe f actory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write Status Register Instruction \ndepending on the state of the SRP0, SRP1 and WEL bits.  \n7.1.5  Sector /Block  Protect Bit (SEC)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable   \nThe non -volatile Sector/Block  Protect bit (SEC)  controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \neither 4KB Sectors (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array \nas shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. The  default  setting is SEC=0. \n7.1.6  Complement Protect (CMP)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S14). It is used in \nconjunction with SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide more flexi bility for the array protection. Once \nCMP is set to 1, previo us array protection set by SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 will be reversed. For \ninstance, when CMP=0, a top 64KB block  can be protected while the rest of the array is not; when \nCMP=1, the top 64KB block will become unprotected while the rest of the array become read -only. Please \nrefer to the Status Register Memory Protection table for details. The  default setting is CMP =0. \n7.1.7  Status Register Protect  (SRP 1, SRP0) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Status  Register Protect  bits (SRP 1 and SRP0 ) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register \n(S8 and S7). The SRP bits control the method of write protection: software protection, hardware \nprotection, power supply lock-down or one time programmable (OTP)  protection.  \nSRP1  SRP0  /WP Status  \nRegister  Description  \n0 0 X Software  \nProtection  /WP pin has no control.

Status Register -2 \n \n7.1.8  Erase/Program Suspend Status (SUS)  – Status Only  \nThe Suspend Status bit is a read only bit in the status register  (S15) that is set to 1 after executing a \nErase/Program Suspend (75h) instruction. The SUS status bit is cleared to 0 by Erase/Program Resume \n(7Ah) instr uction as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n7.1.9  Security Register Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1) – Volatile/ Non-Volatile OTP Writable  \nThe Security Register Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1) are non -volatile One Time Program (OTP) bits in \nStatus Register (S13, S12, S11) that provide the write protect control and status to the Security \nRegisters. The default state of LB3 -1 is 0, Security Registers are unlocked. LB3 -1 can be set to 1 \nindividually using the Write Status Register instruction. LB3 -1 are One Time Programmable (OTP), once \nit’s set to 1, the corresponding 256 -Byte Security Register will become read -only permanent ly. \n7.1.10  Quad Enable  (QE) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Quad Enable (QE ) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S 9) that allows Quad SPI \nand QPI operation . When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default  for part number with ordering \noptions “IG”,”IP” and “IF”), the /WP pin  and /HOLD are enabled . When the QE bit is set to a 1 (factory \ndefault for Quad Enabled part numbers with ordering option “IQ”), the Quad IO2 and IO3 pins are \nenabled, and /WP and /HOLD functions are disabled.  \nQE bit is required to be set to a 1 before issuing an “Enter QPI (38h)” to switch the device from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI to QPI, otherwise the command will be ignored. When the device is in QPI \nmode, QE bit will remain to be 1. A “Write Status Register” co mmand in QPI mode cannot change QE \nbit from a “1” to a “0”.  \n \nWARNING: If the /WP or /HOLD pins are tied directly to the power supply or ground during \nstandard SPI or Dual SPI operation, the QE bit should never be set to a 1.  \nW25Q 128FW   \n \n \n- 19 -  \nS23 S22 S21 S20 S19 S18 S17 S16\nHOLD\n/RSTDRV1DRV0 (R) (R) WPS\nOutput Driver Strength\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\nReserved\nWrite Protect Selection\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)/HOLD or /RESET Function\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)(R) (R)\nReserved\n \nFigure 4 c. Status Register -3 \n7.1.11  Write Protect Selection (WP S) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe WPS bit is used to select which Write Protect scheme should be used . When WPS=0, the device will \nuse the combination o f CMP, SEC, TB, BP[2 :0] bits to protect a specific area of the memor y array. When \nWPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual Block Locks to protect any individual sector or blocks. The \ndefault value for all Individual Block Lock bits is 1 upon device power on or after reset.  \n7.1.12  Output Driver Strength (DRV1, DRV0) – Volatil e/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe DRV1 & DRV0 bits are used to determine the output driver strength for the Read operations . \nDRV1, DRV0  Driver Strength  \n0, 0 100%  \n0, 1 75% \n1, 0 50% \n1, 1 25%(default)  \n7.1.13  /HOLD or /RESET Pin Function (HOLD/RST) – Volatile/Non -Vola tile Writable  \nThe HOLD/RST bit is used to determine whether /HOLD or /RESET function should be implemented on \nthe hardware pin  for 8-pin packages . When HOLD/RST=0 (factory default), the pin acts as /HOLD; when \nHOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as /RESET. However, / HOLD or /RESET functions are only available when \nQE=0. If QE is set to 1, the /HOLD and /RESET functions are disabled, the pin acts as a dedicated data \nI/O pin.  \n W25Q 128FW   \n \nPublication Release Date:  May 18, 2017  \n- 20 -                                     Revision K  7.1.14  Reserved Bits – Non Functional  \nThere are a few reserved Status Register bits that may be read o ut as a “0” or “1”. It is recommended to \nignore the values of those bits. During a “Write Status Register” instruction, the Reserved Bits can be \nwritten as “0”, but there will not be any effects.  \nW25Q 128FW   \n \n \n- 21 - 7.1.15  6bhW25Q128FW  Status Register Memory Protection  (WPS  = 0, CM P = 0 ) \n \nSTATUS REGISTER(1) W25Q 128FW  (128M -BIT) MEMORY PROTECTI ON(3)  \nSEC TB BP2 BP1 BP0 PROTECTED  \nBLOCK(S)  PROTECTED  \nADDRESSES  PROTECTED  \nDENSITY  PROTECTED  \nPORTION(2) \nX X 0 0 0 NONE  NONE  NONE  NONE  \n0 0 0 0 1 252 thru 255 FC0000h – FFFFFFh  256KB  Upper 1/6 4 \n0 0 0 1 0 248 thru 255 F80000h – FFFFFFh  512KB  Upper 1/32  \n0 0 0 1 1 240 thru 255  F00000h – FFFFFFh  1MB Upper 1/16  \n0 0 1 0 0 224 thru 255 E00000h – FFFFFFh  2MB Upper 1/8  \n0 0 1 0 1 192 thru 255  C00000h – FFFFFFh  4MB Upper 1/4  \n0 0 1 1 0 128 thru 255  800000h – FFFFFFh  8MB Upper 1/2  \n0 1 0 0 1 0 thru 3  000000h – 03FFFFh  256KB  Lower 1/64  \n0 1 0 1 0 0 thru 7  000000h – 07FFFFh  512KB  Lower 1/32  \n0 1 0 1 1 0 thru 15  000000h – 0FFFFFh  1MB Lower 1/16  \n0 1 1 0 0 0 thru 31  000000h – 1FFFFFh  2MB Lower 1/8  \n0 1 1 0 1 0 thru 63  000000h – 3FFFFFh  4MB Lower 1/4  \n0 1 1 1 0 0 thru 127 000000h – 7FFFFFh  8MB Lower 1/2  \nX X 1 1 1 0 thru 255 000000h – FFFFFFh  16MB  ALL \n1 0 0 0 1 255 FFF000 h – FFFFFFh  4KB U - 1/4096  \n1 0 0 1 0 255 FFE000 h – FFFFFFh  8KB U - 1/2048  \n1 0 0 1 1 255 FFC000 h – FFFFFFh  16KB  U - 1/1024  \n1 0 1 0 X 255 FF8000 h – FFFFFFh  32KB  U - 1/512  \n1 1 0 0 1 0 000000h – 000FFFh  4KB L - 1/4096  \n1 1 0 1 0 0  000000h – 001FFFh  8KB L - 1/2048  \n1 1 0 1 1 0  000000h – 003FFFh  16KB  L - 1/1024  \n1 1 1 0 X 0  000000h – 007FFF h 32KB  L - 1/512  \n \nNote s: \n1.

INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe Standard/Dual/Quad SPI instruction set of the W25 Q128FW  consists of 45 basic instructions that are \nfully controlled through the SPI bus (see Instruc tion Set Table1-2). Instructions are initiated with the falling \nedge of Chip Select (/CS) . The first byte of data clo cked into the DI  input provides the i nstruction code. \nData on the DI  input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with mo st significant bit  (MSB) first.  \nThe QPI instruction set of the W25 Q128FW  consists of 32 basic instructions that are fully controlled \nthrough the SPI bus (see Instruction Set Table 3). Instructions are initiated with the falling edge of Chip \nSelect (/CS). The first byte of d ata clocked through IO[3:0] pins provides the instruction code. Data on all \nfour IO pins are  sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant bit (MSB) first.  All QPI \ninstructions, addresses, data and dummy bytes are using all four IO pins to tran sfer every byte of data with \nevery two serial clocks (CLK).  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address bytes, data \nbytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are compl eted with the \nrising edge of edge  /CS. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction are included in Figures 5 \nthrough 57. All read instructions can be completed after any clocked bit. However, all instructions that \nWrite, Program or Erase must compl ete on a byte boundary ( /CS driven high after a full 8 -bits have been \nclocked) otherwise the instruction will be ignor ed. This feature further protects the device from inadvertent \nwrites. Additionally, while the memory is being programmed or erased, or whe n the Status Register is \nbeing written, all instructions except for Read Status Register will be ignored until the program or erase \ncycle has completed.  \n8.1 Device ID and Instruction Set Tables  \n8.1.1  Manufacturer and Device Identification  \nMANUFACTURER ID  (MF7 -

Read Status Register Instruction (QPI  Mode ) \n \n \n8.2.5  Write Status  Register -1 (01h), Status Register -2 (31h) & Status Register -3 (11h)  \nThe Write Status Register instruction allows the Status Register s to be written. The writable Status \nRegister bi ts include: SRP0, SEC, TB, BP[2 :0] in Status Register -1; CMP, LB[3: 1], QE, SRP1 in Status \nRegister -2; HOL D/RST, DRV1, DRV0, WPS  in Status Register -3. All other Status Register bit locations \nare read -only and will not be affected by the Write Status Register instruction. LB [3:1] are non -volatile \nOTP bi ts, once it is set to 1, it c annot be cleared to 0.  \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously have \nbeen executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL \nmust equal 1). Once wri te enabled, the instruction is entered by driving /CS low, sending the instruction \ncode “01h /31h/11h ”, and then writing the status register data byte as illustrated in Figure  9a & 9b . \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Stat us Register (50h) instruction must \nhave been executed prior to the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL remains 0). \nHowever, SRP1 and LB[3: 1] cannot  be changed from “1” to “0” because of the OTP protection for these \nbits. Upon power o ff or the execution of a Software/Hardware Reset , the volatile Status Register bit values \nwill be lost, and the non -volatile Status Register bit values will be restored . \nDuring non -volatile Status Register write operation (06h combined with 01h /31h/11h), after /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See AC \nCharacteristics). While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction \nmay still be accessed to check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Write Status \nRegister cycle and a 0 when the cycle is finished and ready to accept other instructions again. After the \nWrite Status Register cycle has finished, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be \ncleared to 0.  \n W25Q 128FW   \n \nPublication Release Date:  May 18, 2017  \n- 32 -                                     Revision K  During volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h /31h/11h), after /CS is driven high, \nthe Status Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  (See AC \nChara cteristics). BUSY bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit refresh period.  \nThe Write Status Register instruction can be used in both SPI mode and QPI mode.

The \ninstruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and then shif ting the instruction code “03h”  followed by a \n24-bit address (A23 -A0) into the DI  pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the \nCLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addr essed memory location will be shifted out \non the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The address is automatically \nincremented to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out allowing for a continuous \nstream of data. This means that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction as long as \nthe clock continues. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in Figure  14. If a Read Data instructio n is issued while an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on the current cycle. The Read Data instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of f R \n(see AC Electrical Characteri stics).  \nThe Read Data (03h) instruction is only supported in Standard SPI mode. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (03h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 724-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1\n**\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 14.

This allows data to be transferred at twice the rate of standard \nSPI devices. The Fast R ead Dual Output instruction is ideal for quickly downloading code from Flash to \nRAM upon power -up or for applications that cache code -segments to RAM for execution.  \nSimilar to the Fast Read instruction, the Fast Read Dual Output instruction can operate at  the highest \npossible frequency of FR (see AC Electrical Characteristics). This is accomplished by adding eight \n“dummy” clocks after the 24 -bit address as shown in Figure 18. The dummy clocks allow the device\'s \ninternal circuits additional time for setting  up the initial address. The input data during the dummy clocks is \n“don’t care”.

The Quad E nable  (QE) bit in  Status \nRegiste r-2 must be set to 1  before the device will accept the Fast Read  Quad Output Instruction . The Fast \nRead Quad Output Instruction  allows data to be transferred at four times  the rate of stan dard SPI devices.   \nThe Fast Read Quad Output instruction can operate  at the highest possible frequency of FR (see AC \nElectrical Characteristics). This is accomplished by adding eight “dummy” clocks after the 24 -bit address \nas shown in Figure 20.

Fast Read Quad  Output Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \nW25Q 128FW   \n \n \n- 39 - 8.2.10  Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)  \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) instruction allows for improved random access while maintaining two IO \npins, IO 0 and IO 1. It is similar to the Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) instruction but with the capability to input \nthe Address bits (A23 -0) two bits per clock. This reduced instruction overhead may allow for code \nexecution (XIP) directly from the D ual SPI in some applications.  \nFast Read Dual I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O instruction can further reduce instruction o verhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” b its (M7 -0) after the input Address bits (A23 -0), as shown in Figure 22a. The \nupper nibble of the (M7 -4) controls the length of the next Fast Read Dual I/O instruction through the \ninclusion or exclusion of  the first byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the (M3 -0) are don’t care \n(“x”).

The Quad I/O dramatically reduces instruction \noverhead allowing faster random access for code execution (XIP) directly from the Quad SPI. The  Quad \nEnable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 must be set to enable the Fast Read Quad I/O  Instruction .  \nFast Read Quad I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O instruction can further reduce instruction overhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7 -0) after the input Address bits (A23 -0), as shown in Figure 24a.

Fast Read Quad I/O Instruction (Previous instruction set M5 -4 = 10 , SPI  Mode ) \n \n \nFast Read Quad I/O with “8/16/32/64 -Byte Wrap Around”  in Standard SPI mode  \n \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O instruction can also be used to access a specific portion within a page by issuing \na “Set Burst with Wrap”  (77h)  command prior to EBh. The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command can \neither enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the following EBh commands. When “Wrap \nAround” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limi ted to either a n 8, 16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a \n256-byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified in the instruction, once it reaches the \nending boundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output will wrap around to the beginning b oundary \nautomatically until /CS is pulled high to terminate the command.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical  address and then \nfill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple read \ncommands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to \nenable or disable the “Wrap Around” operation while W6-5 are used to specify the length of the wrap \naround sectio n within a page. Refer to section 8.2. 24 for detail descriptions.  \nW25Q 128FW   \n \n \n- 43 -  \nFast Read Quad I/O (EBh) in QPI Mode  \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O instruction is also supported in QPI mode , as shown in Figure 1 9c. When QPI \nmode is enabled, the number of dummy clocks is confi gured by the “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” \ninstruction to accommodate a wide range of applications with different needs for either maximum Fast \nRead frequency or minimum data access latency. Depending on the Read Parameter Bits P[5:4] setting, \nthe number of dummy clocks can be configured as either 2, 4, 6 or 8. The default number of dummy \nclocks upon power up or after a Reset instruction is 2 . In QPI mode, the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M7 -\n0 are also considered as dummy clocks. In the default setting, the da ta output will follow the Continuous \nRead Mode bits immediately.  \n“Continuous Read Mode” feature is also available in QPI mode for Fast Read Quad I/O instruction. Please \nrefer to the description on previous page s. \n“Wrap Around” feature is not available in Q PI mode for Fast Read Quad I/O instruction. To perform a read \noperation with fixed data length wrap around in QPI mode, a dedicated “Burst Read with Wrap” (0Ch) \ninstruction must be used. Please refer to 8.2.45 for details.  \nFigure 24c.

Certain applications can benefit from this feature and improve the overall system \ncode execution performance.  \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low \nand then shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by  24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap Bits”, W7 -0. The \ninstruction sequence is shown in Figure 28.

To exit the “Wrap Around” function and return to normal read operation, another Set Burst with \nWrap instruction should be issued to set W4 = 1. The default value of W4 upon power on or after a \nsoftware/hardware reset is 1.  \nIn QPI mode,  the “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instruction should be used to perform the Read operation \nwith “Wrap Around” feature.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device \nwill accept the Page Program Instruction (Status Register bit WEL = 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the  /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” fo llowed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and \nat least one data byte, into the DI  pin. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction \nwhile data is being sent to the device. The Page Program instruction sequence is shown in Figure 2 9. \nIf an entire 256 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant address bits) \nshould be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks exceed s the remaining \npage length, the addressing will wrap to the b eginning of the page. In some cases, less than 256 bytes (a \npartial page) can be programmed without having any effect on other bytes within the same page. One \ncondition to perform a partial page program is that the number of clocks cannot  exceed the remain ing \npage length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the \npage and overwrite previously sent data.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the l ast byte \nhas been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for a time duration of tpp (See AC \nCharacteristics). While the Page Program cy cle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may \nstill be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Page Program \ncycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept other ins tructions \nagain.

The Quad Page Program can \nimprove performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have sl ow clock speeds <5MHz. \nSystems with faster clock speed will not realize much benefit for the Quad Page Program instruction since \nthe inherent page program time is much greater than the time it take to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad En able (QE) bit in Stat us Register -2 must be set to 1 . A Write \nEnable instruction  must be executed before the device will accept the Quad Page Program instruction \n(Status Register -1, WEL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifti ng the \ninstruction code “32h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the IO pins. \nThe /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device. \nAll other functions of Quad Page  Program are identical to s tandard Page Program.

The Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequence is shown in Figure 35a & 35b. \nThe Write Status R egister instruction (01h) and Erase instructions (20h, 52h, D8h, C7h, 60h, 44h) are not \nallowed during Erase Suspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase operation. If \nwritten during the Chip Erase operation, the Erase Suspend inst ruction is ignored. The Write Status \nRegister instruction (01h) and Program instructions (02h, 32h, 42h) are not allowed during Program \nSuspend. Program Suspend is valid only during the Page Program or Quad Page Program operation.  \nThe Erase/Program Suspend  instruction “75h” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit in the \nStatus Register equals to 0 and the BUSY bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a Page \nProgram operation is on -going. If the SUS bit equals to 1 or the BUSY bit equals t o 0, the Suspend \ninstruction will be ignored by the device. A maximum of time of “t SUS” (See AC Characteristics) is required \nto suspend the erase or program operation. The BUSY bit in the Status Register will be cleared from 1 to \n0 within “t SUS” and the SU S bit in the Status Register will be set from 0 to 1 immediately after \nErase/Program Suspend. For a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it is also required that the \nSuspend instruction “75h” is not issued earlier than a minimum of time of “t SUS” following the preceding \nResume instruction “7Ah”.  \nUnexpected power off during the Erase/Program suspend state will reset the device and release the \nsuspend state. SUS bit in the Status Register will also reset to 0. The data within the page, sector or block \nthat was being suspended may become corrupted. It is recommended for the user to implement system \ndesign techniques against the accidental power interruption and preserve data integrity during \nerase/program suspend state.  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (75h)\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3tSUS\nAccept instructions\n \nFigure 35a.

The lower power consumption makes the Power -down \ninstruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See ICC1 and  ICC2 in AC Characteristics). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “B9h” as  shown in \nFigure 37a & 3 7b.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Powe r-down \ninstruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the power -down state will entered within the time \nduration of t DP (See AC Characteristics). While in the power -down  state only the Release  Power -down / \nDevice ID (ABh) instruction, which re stores the device to normal operation, will be recognized. All other \ninstructions are ignored. This includes the Read Status Register instruction, which is always available \nduring normal operation. Ignoring all but one instruction makes the Power Down stat e a useful condition \nfor securing maximum write protection.

It can be used to \nrelease the device from the power -down state , or obtain the de vices electronic identification (ID) number.  \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the /CS pin low, \nshifting the instruction code “ABh” and driving /CS high as shown in Figure 38a & 3 8b. Release from \npower -down will take the time duration of t RES1 (See AC Characteristics) before the device will resume \nnormal operation and other instructions are accepted. The /CS pin must remain high during the t RES1 time \nduration.  \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruction is initiated by \ndriving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy bytes. The Device ID \nbits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first . The Device ID \nvalue  for the W25 Q128FW  is listed in Manufacturer and Device Identification table. The Device ID can be \nread continuously. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obta in the Device ID, the instruction is \nthe same as previously described, and shown in Figure 38c & 3 8d, except that after /CS is driven high it \nmust remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See AC Characteristics). After this time duration the device \nwill resume normal operation and other instructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power -down / \nDevice ID instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (when BUSY equals \n1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effe cts on the current cycle. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (ABh)Mode 0Mode 3tRES1\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 38a.

The SFDP \nparameter s are stored in one or more Parameter Identification (PID) tables. Currently only one PID table \nis specified, but more may be added in the future.  The Read SFDP Register instruction is com patible \nwith the SFDP standard initially established in 2010  for PC and other applications, as well as the JEDEC \nstandard JESD216 -serials  that is published in 2011 . Most Winbond SpiFlash Memories shipped after \nJune 2011 (date code 1124 and beyond) support the SFDP feature as specified in the applicable \ndatasheet.  \nThe Read  SFDP instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “5Ah” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin. Eight “dummy” clocks are also required before \nthe SFDP register contents are shifted out on the fall ing edge of the 40th CLK with most significant bit \n(MSB) first as shown in Figure  34.

These re gisters may be used by the system manufacturers to store security and other \nimportant information separately from the main memory array.  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction. A Write Enable \ninstruction must be executed before the device will accept the Erase Security Register Instruction \n(Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “44h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) to erase one of the three \nsecurity registers.  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 45. The /CS pin must be driven \nhigh after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction will not be \nexecuted. After /CS is driven high, the self -timed Erase Security R egister operation will commence for a \ntime duration of t SE (See AC Characteristics). While the Erase Security Register cycle is in progress, \nthe Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The \nBUSY bit is  a 1 during the erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is \nready to accept other instructions again. After the Erase Security Register cycle has finished the Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0.  The Security Register Lock Bits (LB3 -1) in \nthe Status Register -2 can be used to OTP protect the security registers. Once a lock bit is set to 1, the \ncorresponding security register will be permanently locked, Erase Security Register instruction to that \nregister will be ignored (Refer to section 7.1.8 for detail descriptions). \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (44h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 2 1 0\n*Mode 0Mode 3\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 45.

It allows from one \nbyte to 256 bytes of security register data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) memory \nlocations. A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Program \nSecurity Register Instruction (Status Reg ister bit WEL= 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS \npin low then shifting the instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) and at least one \ndata byte, into the DI pin. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the  instruction while data \nis being sent to the device.  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nThe Program Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 46.

The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the /CS pin low and then shifting the instruction co de “48h” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0) \nand eight “dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of \nthe CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be \nshifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The byte \naddress is automatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of data is shifted out. \nOnce the byte address reaches the last byte of the register ( byte address FFh), it will reset to address \n00h, the first byte of the register, and continue to increment. The instruction is completed by driving /CS \nhigh. The Read Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 47. If a Read Security \nRegister  instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the \ninstruction is ignored and will not have any effects on the current cycle. The Read Security Register \ninstruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of F R (see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \nADDRESS  A23-16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h 0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h 0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (48h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\nDummy Byte\nHigh Impedance40 41 42 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7Data Out 2\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 043 31\n0= MSB*\n \nFigure 46.

The dummy clocks \nfor various Fast Read instructions  in Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode  are fixed, please refer to the \nInstruction Table  1-2 for detail s. The “Wrap Length” is set by W5 -4 bit in the “Set Burst with Wrap  (77h) ” \ninstruction. This setting will remain unchanged when the device is switched from Standard SPI mode to \nQPI mode.  \nThe default “Wrap Length” after a power up or a Reset instruction is 8 bytes, the default number of \ndummy clocks is 2.  The number of dummy clocks is only programmable for “Fast Read (0Bh)”, “Fast \nRead Quad I/O (EBh)” & “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instructions in the QPI mode.

However, SPI mode and QPI mode cannot  be used at the same time. “ Enter \nQPI (38h)” instruction is the only way to switch the device from SPI mode to QPI m ode.  \nUpon power -up, the default state of the device upon is Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. This provides full \nbackward compatibility with earlier generations of Winbond serial flash memories. See Instruction  Set \nTable 1 -3 for all supported SPI commands. In order to sw itch the device to QPI mode, the Quad Ena ble \n(QE) bit in Status Register -2 must be set to 1 first, and an “ Enter QPI  (38h)” instruction must be issued. If \nthe Quad E nable (QE) bit is 0, the “Enter  QPI (38h)” instruction will be ignored and the d evice will remain \nin SPI mode.  \nSee Instruction Set Table 3  for all the commands supported in QPI mode.  \nWhen the device is switched from SPI mode to QPI mode, the existing  Write Enable and Program/Erase \nSuspend status, and the Wrap Length setting will remai n unchanged.  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (38h)\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3\n \nFigure 49.

The Block/Sector Lock bit  value will be \nshifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure \n53.

Once the Reset instruction is accepted, any \non-going internal operations will b e terminated and the device will return to its default power -on state  and \nlose all the current volatile settings, such as Volatile Status Register bits, Write Enable Latch (WEL) \nstatus, Program/Erase Suspend status, Read parameter setting  (P7-P0), Continuo us Read Mode bit \nsetting (M7 -M0) and Wrap Bit setting (W6 -W4).  \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” instructions can be issued in either SPI mode or QPI mode. To \navoid accidental reset, both instructions must be issued in sequen ce. Any other commands oth er than  \n“Reset (99h)” after the “Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the “Reset Enable” state. A new \nsequence of “Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is needed to reset the device.  Once the Reset \ncommand is accepted by the device, the device will t ake approximately tRST=30us to reset. During this \nperiod, no command will be accepted.  \nData corruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended internal Erase or Program  operation \nwhen Reset command sequence is accepted by the device.
