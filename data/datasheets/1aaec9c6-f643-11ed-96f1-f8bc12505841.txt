The combination of low on-resistance and high load current handling capability makes this relay suitable for a variety of high performance DC switching applications.\nThe unique ISOPLUS-264 package pioneered by \nIXYS enables Solid State Relays to achieve the highest load current and power ratings. This package features a unique IXYS process where the silicon chips are soft soldered onto the Direct Copper Bond (DCB) substrate instead of the traditional copper leadframe. The DCB ceramic, the same substrate used in high power modules, not only provides 2500V\nrms isolation but also very low junction-to-case \nthermal impedance (0.3 °C/W).\nOrdering Information\nSwitching CharacteristicsParameter Rating Units\nBlocking Voltage 60 VP\nLoad Current, TA=25°C:\nWith 5°C/W Heat Sink 22.8ADCNo Heat Sink 9\nOn-Resistance (max) 0.05 \uf057\nThermal Impedance, \nJunction-to-Case, \uf071JC 0.3 °C/W\n12 34\n+- -+Part Description\nCPC1709J ISOPLUS-264 Package (25 per tube)\nForm-A\nIF\nILOAD10%90%\ntontoffCPC1709\n60V Single-Pole, Normally Open\nDC-Only Power Relay\nINTEGRATED  CIRCUITS  DIVISION\nR09 www.ixysic.com 2CPC1709\n1  Specifications\n1.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings @ 25°C\nAbsolute maximum ratings are stress ratings.

The classificati on temperature sets the Maximum Body \nTemperature allowed for this device during lead-free re flow processes.

Board washing to reduce or remove flux \nresidue following the solder reflow process is acceptable provided proper precautions are taken to prevent damage to \nthe device. These precautions include but are not limited to : using a low pressure wash and providing a follow up bake \ncycle sufficient to remove any moisture  trapped within the device due to the washing process. Due to the variability of \nthe wash parameters used to clean the board, determination of the bake temperature and duration necessary to remove the moisture trapped within the package is the res ponsibility of the user (assembler). Cleaning or drying \nmethods that employ ultrasonic energy may damage the devi ce and should not be used. Additionally, the device must \nnot be exposed to flux or solvents that are Chlorine- or Fluorine-based.Device Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) Classification\nCPC1709J MSL 1\nDevice Classification Temperature (TC) Dwell Time (tp) Max Reflow Cycles\nCPC1709J 245°C 30 seconds 1\nINTEGRATED  CIRCUITS  DIVISION\n7 www.ixysic.com R09CPC1709\n4.5 Mechanical Dimensions\n26.162 ± 0.254\n(1.030 ± 0.010)19.914 ± 0.254\n(0.784 ± 0.010)\n20.396 ± 0.50 8\n(0.803 ± 0.020)\n15.240 ± 0.50 8\n(0.600 ± 0.020)3.810 ± 0.254\n(0.150 ± 0.010)2.362 ± 0.3 81\n(0.093 ± 0.015)\n0.635 ± 0.076\n(0.025 ± 0.003) 2.794 ± 0.127\n(0.110 ± 0.005)5.029 ± 0.127\n(0.198 ± 0.005) 1.181 ± 0.076\n(0.047 ± 0.003)\n1.930 ± 0.3 81\n(0.076 ± 0.015)17.221 ± 0.254\n(0.678 ± 0.010)\n20.600 ± 0.254\n(0.811 ± 0.010)\n1.270 TYP\n(0.050 TYP)DIMENSIO NS\nmm\n(inches)\nNOTE: Metallized external s urface of DCB s ubstrate maintains 2500 Vrms            isolation to de vice internal str ucture and all external pins.DCB Substrate\nNOTE: Not to be soldered\nFor additional information please visit our website at: www.ixysic.com\nIXYS Integrated Circuits makes no representations or warranties with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the contents of  this publication and reserves the right to make changes to \nspecifications and product descriptions at any time without notice.
