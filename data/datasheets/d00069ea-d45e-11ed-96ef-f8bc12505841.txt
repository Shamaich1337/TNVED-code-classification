E | Page 5  of 94 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD7124 -8 is a low power, low noise, complete ly integrated  \nanalog front end for high precision measurement applications. \nThe device  contains a low noise, 24 -bit Σ-Δ analog -to-digital \nconverter ( ADC ), and can be configured to have 8  differential \ninputs or 15 single -ended or pseudo differential  inputs. The on -\nchip low gain stage e nsures that signals of small amplitude can \nbe interfaced directly to the ADC.  \nOne of t he major advantages of the AD7124- 8 is that it gives the \nuser the flexibility to employ one of three  integrated power \nmodes. The current consumption, range of outp ut data rates , \nand rms noise can be tailored  with the power mode selected. \nThe device also offers a multitude  of filter options , ensuring that \nthe user has the highest  degree of flexibility.  \nThe AD7124 -8 can achieve simul taneous 50 Hz and 60 Hz \nrejection when operating at an output data rate of 25 SPS (single \ncycle settling) , with rejection in excess of 80 dB  achieved at lower \noutput data rates.  \nThe AD7124 -8 establishes the highest degree of signal chain \nintegration. The device  contains a precision, low noise, low \ndrift  internal band gap reference  and accepts an external \ndifferential reference , which can be internally buffered. Other \nkey integrated  features inc lude programmable low drift excitation  \ncurrent sources, burnout currents, and a bias voltage generator , \nwhich set s the common -mode voltage of a channel to AV DD/2. \nThe low-side power switch enables the user to power down \nbridge sensors between conversions, ensuring the absolute \nminimal power consumption of the system. The device also allows the user the option of operating with either an internal \nclock or an external clock . \nThe integrated  channel sequencer allows several channels to be \nenabled simultaneously , and the AD7124 -8 sequentially converts  \non each enabled channel, simplifying communication with the device . As many as  16 chan nels can be enabled at any time , a \nchannel being  defined as  an an alog input or a diagnostic such as \na power supply check or a reference check. This unique feature \nallows diagnostics to  be interleaved with conversions. The \nAD7124- 8 also supports per channel configuration. The device \nallows eight  configurations  or setups.  Each configuration \nconsist s of gain, filter type, output data rate, buffering, and \nreference source. The user can assign any  of the se setups on a \nchannel by channel  basis . \nThe AD7124 -8 also has extensive diagnostic functionality \nintegrated as part of its comprehensive feature set . These \ndiagnostics include  a cyclic redundancy check  (CRC ), signal \nchain checks, and serial interface checks, which lead to a more \nrobust solution. These diagnostics reduce the need for external components to implement diagnostics , resulting in reduced \nboard space needs, reduced design cycle times, and cost savings. \nThe failure modes effects and diagnostic  analysis (FMEDA ) of a \ntypical application has shown a  safe failure fraction (SFF) greater \nthan  90% according to IEC 61508.  \nThe device  operates with a single analog power supply from 2.7 V  \nto 3.6 V or a dual 1.8 V power supply. The digital supply has a \nrange of 1.65 V to 3.6 V . It is specified for a temperature range \nof −40°C to + 125°C . The AD7124- 8 is housed in a 32- lead \nLFCSP package.  \nNote that, throughout this data sheet, multifunction pins,  such \nas DOUT/EE\nAA, are referred to either by the entire pin name or \nby a single function of the pin, for example, AARDYEE\nAA, when only \nthat function is relevant.  RDY\nThe AD7124 -8 B grade  has some operational and performance \ndifferences from the AD7124- 8. Table 1 lists the differences. \nUnless otherwise noted, all re ferences to AD7124- 8 refer to the \ndevice and not to the B grade.  \nTable 1.

For the other power modes, this specification is supported by characterization data a t the initial product \nrelease.  \n5 Following a system or internal zero -scale calibration, the offset error is in the order of the noi se for the programmed gain and output data rate selected. A system full - \nscale calibration reduces the gain error to the order of the noise for the programmed gain and output data rate.  \n6 Recalibration at any temperature removes these errors.  \n7 Gain error applies to both positive and negative full -scale. A factory calibration is performed at gain = 1, T A = 25°C.  \n8 When gain > 1, the common -mode  voltage is between (AV SS + 0.1 + 0.5/g ain) and (AV DD − 0.1 − 0.5/gain).  \n9 Specification is for a wider common -mode  voltage between (AV SS − 0.05 + 0.5/gain) and (AV DD − 0.1 − 0.5/gain).  \n10 REJ60 is a bit in the filter registers. When the first notch of the sinc filter is at 50 Hz, a notch is placed at 60 Hz when REJ60 is set to 1. This gives simultaneous 50 Hz and \n60 Hz rejection.  \n11 When the gain is greater than 1, the analog input buffers are enabled automatically. The buffers can only be disabled when th e gain equals 1.  \n12 When V REF = (AV DD − AV SS), the typical differential input equals 0.92 × V REF/gain for the low and mid power modes and 0.86 × V REF/gain for  full power mode when gain > 1.  \n13 The digital inputs are equal to IOV DD or DGND with excitation  currents and bias voltage generator disabled.  \n \nTIMING CHARACTERISTI CS \nAV DD = 2.9 V to 3.6 V (full power mode), 2.7 V to 3.6 V (mid and low power mode), IOV DD = 1.65 V to 3.6 V,  AV SS = DGND  = 0 V , Input \nLogic 0 = 0 V , Input Logic 1 = IOV DD, unless otherwise noted. \nTab le 4. \nParameter1, 2 Min  Typ  Max  Unit  Test Conditions/Comments  \nt3 100    ns  SCLK high pulse width  \nt4 100   ns  SCLK low pulse width  \nt12     Delay between consecutive read/write operations  \n 3/MCLK3    ns  Full power mode  \n 12/MCLK    ns  Mid power mode  \n 24/MCLK    ns  Low power mode  \nt13    µs DOUT/EE\nAA high time if DOUT/ AARDYEE\nAA is low and the next \nconversion is available  RDY\n  6  µs Full power mode  \n  25  µs Mid power mode  \n  50  µs Low power mode \nt14     AASYNCEE\nAA low pulse width  \n 3/MCLK    ns Full power mode  \n 12/MCLK    ns Mid power mode  \n 24/MCLK    ns Low power mode \nREAD  OPERATION       \nt1 0  80 ns  AACSEE\nAA falling edge to DOUT/ AARDYE\nAA active time  \nt24 0  80 ns  SCLK active edge5 to data valid delay  \nt56, 7 10  80 ns  Bus relinquish time after ACSE\nA inactive edge  \nt6 0   ns  SCLK inactive edge to ACSE\nA inactive edge  \nt78     SCLK inactive edge to DOUT/ ARDYE\nA high  \n 10   ns  The DOUT_ ARDYE\nA_DEL bit is cleared, the ACSE\nA_EN bit is \ncleared  \n 110   ns The DOUT_ ARDYE\nA_DEL bit is  set, the ACSE\nA_EN bit is  cleared  \nt7A7 t5   ns Data valid after ACSE\nA inactive edge , the ACSE\nA_EN bit is set  \nAD7124-8 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

All input signals are specified with tR = t F = 5 ns (10% to 90% of IOV DD and \ntimed from a voltage level of IOV DD/2. \n2 See Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6. \n3 MCLK is the master clock frequency.  \n4 These specifications are measur ed with the load circuit shown in  Figure 2 and defined as the time  required for the output to c ross the V OL or V OH limits. \n5 The SCLK active edge is the falling edge of SCLK. \n6 These specifications are derived from the me asured time taken by the data output to change by 0.5 V when loaded with the circu it shown in Figure 2. The measured \nnumber is then extrapolated back to remove the effects of cha rging or discharging the 25 pF capacitor. The times quoted in the timing characteristics are the true bus \nrelinquish times of the device and, therefore, are independent of external bus loading capacitances. \n7 RDY  returns high after a read of the ADC. In single conversion mode and continuous conversion mode, the same data can be read agai n, if required, while RDY  is high, \nalthough subsequent reads must not occur close to the next output update. In continuous read mode, the digital word can be read  only once.  \n8 When the CS_EN bit is cleared, the DOUT/ RDY  pin changes from its DOUT function to its RDY  function, following the last inactive edge of the SCLK. When CS_EN is set, \nthe DOUT pin continues to output the LSB of the data until the CS inactive edge. \n \nTiming Diagrams \nIOV DD/2 TO OUTPUT PIN\nISOURCE  (100µA)ISINK (100µA)\n25pF\n13048-002\n \nFigure 2.

This pin is a l ogic input that allows synchronization of the digital filters and analog \nmodulators when using a number of AD7124 -8 devices. Wh en ASYNCE\nA is low, the nodes of the digital filter, \nthe filter control logic, and the calibration control logic are reset, and the analog modulator is held in a \nreset state. ASYNCE\nA does n ot affect the digital interface but does reset ARDYE\nA to a high state if it is low.  \n28 DOUT/ ARDYE Serial Data Output/Data Ready Output. DOUT/ ARDYE\nA functions as a serial data output pin to acces s the \noutput shift register of the ADC. The output shift register can contain data from any of the on -chip data or \ncontrol registers. In addition, DOUT/ ARDYE\nA operates as a data ready pin, going low to indicate the completion of a \nconve rsion. If the data is not read after the conversion, the pin goes high before the next update occurs. \nThe DOUT/ ARDYE\nA falling edge can also be used as an interrupt to a processor, indicating that valid data is \navailable. With an externa l serial clock, the data can be read using the DOUT/ ARDYE\nA pin. W hen  ACSE\nA is low, the \ndata/control word information is placed on the DOUT/ ARDYE\nA pin on the SCLK falling edge and is valid on \nthe S CLK rising edge.  \n29 DIN  Serial Data Input to the Input Shift Register on the ADC. Data in th e input  shift register is transferred to \nthe control registers within the ADC , with the register selection bits of the communications register \nidentifying the app ropriate register.  \n30 SCLK  Serial Clock Input. This serial clock input is for data transfers to and from the ADC. The SCLK  pin has a Schmitt -\ntriggered input, making the interface suitable for opto -isolated applications. The serial clock can be continuou s \nwith all data transmitted in a continuous train of pulses. Alternatively, it can be a noncontinuous clock \nwith the information being transmitted to or from the ADC in smaller batches of data.  \n31 CLK  Clock In put/Clock Out put. The internal clock can be made available at this pin. Alternatively, the internal \nclock can be disabled, and the ADC can be driven by an external clock. This allows several ADCs to be driven from a common clock, allowing simultaneous conversions to be performed.  \n32 \nACSE Chip Select Input. This is an active low logic input that  select s the ADC. Use ACSE\nA to select the ADC in systems \nwith more than one device on the serial bus or as a frame synchronization signal in communicating with the \ndevice. ACSE\nA can be hardwired low if the serial peripheral interface  (SPI) diagnostics are un used, allowing the \nADC to operate in 3 -wire  mode with SCLK, DIN, and DOUT  interfacing  with the device.  \n EP Exposed Pad. Connect the exposed pad  to A VSS.  \n \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 18 of 94 TERMINOLOGY  \nAIN P \nAIN P refers to the positive a nalog input.  \nAIN M \nAIN M refers to the negative analog input . \nIntegral  Nonlinearity (INL)  \nINL is the maximum deviation of any code from a straight line \npassing through the endpoints of the transfer  function. The \nendpoints of the transfer function are zero scale (not to be \nconfused with bipolar zero), a point 0.5 LSB below the first code transition (000 … 000 to 000 …  001) , and full scale, a point \n0.5 LSB above the last code transition (111 …  110 to 111 … \n111). The error i s expressed in ppm  of the full-scale range.  \nGain Error  \nGain error is the deviation of the last code transition (111  … \n110 to 111 …  111) from the ideal AIN P voltage (AIN M + \nV\nREF/gain  − 3/2 LSBs). Gain error applies to both unipolar \nand bipolar analog input ranges.  \nGain error is a measure of the span error of the ADC. It includes full -scale errors but not zero -scale errors. For unipolar \ninput ranges , it is defined as full -scale error minus unipolar \noffset error;  whereas  for bipolar inpu t ranges it i s defined as \nfull-scale error minus bipolar zero error.  Offset Error  \nOffset error is the deviation of the first code transition from the \nideal AINP  voltage (AIN M + 0.5 LSB) when operating in the \nunipolar mode.  \nIn bipolar mode, offset error is the deviation of the midscale transition (0111 … 111 to 1000 … 000) from the ideal AIN P \nvoltage (AIN M − 0.5 LSB).  \nOffset  Calibration  Range  \nIn the system calibration modes, the AD7124- 8 calibra tes offset \nwith respect to the analog input. The o ffset calibration range \nspecification defines the range of voltages that the AD7124- 8 \ncan accept and still calibrate offset accurately.  \nFull-Scale Calibration  Range  \nThe f ull-scale calibration range is the range of voltages that the \nAD7124- 8 can accept in the system calibration mode and still \ncalibrate full scale correctly.  \nInput  Span \nIn system calibration schemes, two voltages applied in sequence to the AD7124- 8 analog input define the analog input range. \nThe input span specification defines the minimum and maximum inpu t voltages from zero to full scale that the \nAD7124- 8 can accept and still calibrate gain accurately.  \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev.

Ba sic Connection Diagram   \nOVERVIEW  \nThe AD7124 -8 is a low power ADC that incorporate s a Σ-Δ modu -\nlator, buffer, reference, gain stage , and on -chip digital filtering, \nwhich is intended for the measurement of wide dynamic range s, \nlow frequency signals (such as those in pressure transducers), \nweigh  scales, and temperature measurement application s.  \nPower Modes  \nThe AD7124 -8 offers three power modes: high power mode, \nmid power mode , and low power mode. This allows the user \ntotal flexibility in terms of speed, rms noise , and current \nconsumption.  \nAnalog Inputs  \nThe device can have 8 differential or 15 pseudo differentia l analog \ninputs. The analog inputs can be buffered or unbuffered. The \nAD7124- 8 uses flexible multiplexing; thus, any analog input pin \ncan be selected as a positive input ( AINP ) and any analog input \npin can be selected as a negative input  (AINM ). \nMultiplexer  \nThe on -chip multiplexer increases the channel count of the device. \nBecause the multiplexer is included on c hip, any channel \nchanges are synchronized with the conversion process.  \nReference \nThe device contains a 2.5 V reference, which has a drift of \n15 ppm/°C  max imum  for the AD7124- 8 and 10 ppm/°C \nmaximum for the AD7124 -8 B grade . \nReference buffers are also included on  chip , which can be used \nwith the internal reference and externally applied references.  Programmable Gain Array ( PGA ) \nThe analog input signal can be amplified using the PGA. The \nPGA allows gains of 1, 2, 4, 8 , 16, 32, 64, and 128.  \nBurnout Currents  \nTwo burnout currents , which can be programmed to 500 nA, \n2 µA, or 4 µA, are included on  chip to detect the presence of the \nexter nal sensor.  \nΣ-Δ ADC and Filter  \nThe AD7124 -8 contains a fourth -order Σ-Δ modulator followed \nby a digital filter. T he device has the following  filter options:  \n• Sinc4 \n• Sinc3 \n• Fast filter \n• Post filter \n• Zero latency   \nChannel Sequencer \nThe AD7124 -8 allows up to 16 confi gurations, or channels. \nThese channels  can consist of analog inputs, reference inputs, or \npower supplies such that  diagnost ic functions , such as power \nsupply monitoring , can be interleaved with conversions. The \nsequencer automatically converts all enabled channels. When each enabled channel is selected, the time required to generate the conversion is equal to the settling time  for the selected channel.  \nPer Channel Configuration  \nThe AD7124 -8 allows up to eight  different setups, e ach setup \nconsisting of a gain, output data rate, filte r type, and a reference \nsource. E ach channel  is then linked to a setup.  \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 38 of 94 Serial Interface  \nThe AD7124 -8 has a 3 -wire or  4-wire SPI. The on -chip registers \nare accessed via the serial interface.  \nClock  \nThe device  has an internal 614.4  kHz clock. Use e ither this \nclock or an external clock as the clock source for the device . The \ninternal clock can also be made available on a pin if a clock \nsource is required for external circuitry.  \nTemperature Sensor  \nThe on -chip temperature sensor monitors the die temperature.  \nDigital Outputs  \nThe AD7124 -8 has four general -purpose digital outputs. These \ncan be used for driving external circuitry. For example, an external multiplexer can  be controlled by these outputs.  \nCalibration  \nBoth internal calibration and system calibration are included on \nchip; therefore, the user has the option of removing offset  or \ngain errors internal to the device  only, or removing the offset  or \ngain errors of the complete end system.  \nExcitation Currents  \nThe device contains two excitation currents that can be set \nindependently to 50 µA, 100 µA, 250 µA, 500 µA, 750 µA, or 1 mA.  \nBias Voltage  \nA bias voltage generator is included on chip so that signals from thermoc ouples can be biased suitably. The bias voltage is set to \nAV\nDD/2 and can be made available on any input. It can supply \nmultiple channels. \nBridge Power Switch (P SW)  \nA low -side power switch allows the user to power down bridges \nthat are interfaced to the ADC . \nDiagnostics  \nThe AD7124 -8 includes numerous diagnostics features such as \n• Reference d etect ion \n• Overvoltage/undervoltage detect ion \n• CRC on SPI  communications  \n• CRC on the memory m ap \n• SPI read/write checks  \nThese diagnostics allow a high level of fault coverage in an application.  \nPOWER SUPPLIES  \nThe AD7124 -8 operates with an analog power supply voltage \nfrom 2.7 V to 3.6 V in low  or mid pow er mode and from 2.9 V \nto 3.6 V in full power mode. The device  accepts a digital power \nsupply from 1.65 V to 3.6 V .  \n \n The device has two independent power supply pins: AV DD and \nIOV DD.  \n• AV DD is referred to AV SS. AV DD powers the internal analog \nregulator that supplies the ADC. \n• IOV DD is referred to DGND. This supply sets the interface \nlogic levels on the SPI interface and powers an internal \nregulator for operation of the digital processing.  \nSingle Supply Operation ( AV SS = DGND)  \nWhen the AD7124- 8 is powered from a single supply that is \nconnected to AV DD, AV SS and DGND  can be shorted together \non one single ground plane. With this setup, an external level shifting circuit is required when using  truly bipolar  inputs to shift \nthe common -mode  voltage. Recommended regulators include \nthe ADP162, which has a low quiescent current.  \nSplit Supply Operation ( AV SS ≠ DGND ) \nThe AD7124 -8 can operate with AV SS set to a negative voltage, \nallowing true bipolar inputs to be applied.  This allows a truly  \nfully differential input signal centered around 0 V to be applied \nto the AD7124- 8 without  the need for an external level shifting \ncircuit.  For example, with a 3.6 V split supply, AV DD = +1.8 V \nand AV SS = −1.8 V . In this use case, the AD7124 -8-internally \nlevel shifts the signals, allowing the digital output to function \nbetween DGND (nominally 0 V) and IOV DD.  \nWhen using a split supply for AV DD and AV SS, the absolute \nmaximum ratings must be considered ( see the Absolute \nMaximum Ratings  section). Ensure that IOV DD is set below \n3.6 V to stay within the absolute maximum rating s for the device.  \nDIGITAL COMM UNICATION  \nThe AD7124 -8 has a 3 -wire or 4 -wire SPI interface that is \ncompatible  with QSPI, MICROWIRE, and DSPs. The interface  \noperates in SPI Mode 3 and can be operated with CS tied low. In \nSPI Mode 3, SCLK idles high, the falling edge of SCLK is the \ndrive  edge, and the rising edge of SCLK is the sample edge. This \nmeans  that data is clocked out on the falling/drive edge and data \nis clocked in on the rising/sample edge.  \nDRIVE EDGE SAMPLE EDGE\n13048-069 \nFigure 65. SPI Mode 3 , SCLK Edges  \nAccessing the ADC Register Map  \nThe communications register controls access to the full register map of the ADC. This register is an 8 -bit, write only register. \nOn power -up or after a reset, the digital i nterface defaults to a \nstate where it  expect s a write to the communications register; \ntherefore, all communication begins by writing to the communications register. \n \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev. E | Page 39 of 94 The data written to the communications register determines \nwhich register is accessed and if the next operation is a read or \nwrite. The register address bits ( Bit 5 to Bit 0) determine the \nspecific register to which the read or write operation applies.  \nWhen the read or write operation to the selected register is \ncomplete, the interface returns to its default state, where it \nexpects a write operation to the communications register.  \nIn situations where interface synchronization is lost, a write operation of at least 64 serial clock cycles with DIN high returns  \nthe ADC to its default state by reset ting the entire device , including \nthe register contents. Alternatively, if \nCS is used with the digital \ninterface, returning CS high resets the digital interface to its \ndefault state and aborts any current operation.  \nFigure 66 and Figure 67 illustrate writing to and reading from a \nregister by first writing the 8 -bit command to the communications  \nregister followed by the data for the address ed re gister.  \nReading the ID register is the recommended method for verifying  \ncorrect communication with the device . The ID register is a read  \nonly register and contains the value of 0x14 for the AD7124- 8 \nand 0x1 6 for the AD7124 -8 B grade .

E | Page 40 of 94 CONFIGURATION OVERVI EW \nAfter power -on or reset, the AD7124- 8 default configuration is \nas follows:  \n• Channel : Channel 0  is enabled, AIN 0 is selected as  the \npositive input, and AIN 1 is selected as the negative input. \nSetup 0 is selected.  \n• Setup : the input and reference buffers are disabled, the gain \nis set to 1 , and the external reference is selected.  \n• ADC  control : the AD7124 -8 is in low power mode, \ncontinuous conversion mode and the internal oscillator is \nenabled and selected as the master clock source.  \n• Diagnostics : the only diagnostic enabled  is the \nSPI_IGNORE_ERR function.  \nNote that only a few of the register setting options are shown; \nthis list is just an example. For full register information, see the \nOn-Chip Registers  section.  \nFigure 68 shows an overview of the suggested flow for changing \nthe ADC configuration, divided into the following three blocks:  \n• Channel configuration (see Box A in Figure 68) \n• Setup (see Box B i n Figure 68)  \n• Diagnostics (see Box C in Figure 68) \n• ADC control (see Box D in Figure 68) Channel Configuration  \nThe AD7124 -8 has 16 independent analog input channels and \neight independent setups. The user can select any of the analog \ninput pairs on any channel, as well as any of the eight setups for any channel, giving the  user full flexibility in the channel configura -\ntion.  This also allows per channel configuration when using all \ndifferential inputs because each channel can have its own dedicated setup.  \nAlong with the analog inputs, signals such as the power supply or ref erence can also be used as inputs ; they are routed to the \nmultiplexer internally when selected. The AD7124 -8 allows the \nuser to define 16 configurations , or channels , to the ADC. This \nallows d iagnostics to be interleaved with conversions.  \nChannel Registers  \nUse t he channel registers to select which input pins are either the \npositive  analog input or the negative analog input for that \nchannel. This register also contains a channel enable/disable bit and the setup selection  bits, which are used to select  which of \nthe eight available setups to  use for this channel.  \nWhen the AD7124- 8 is operating with more than one channel \nenabled, the channel sequencer cycles through the enabled channels in sequential order, from Channel  0 to Channel  15. If a \nchannel is disabled, it is skipped by the sequencer. Details of the channel register for Channel  0 are shown in Table  40. \n \nDIAGNOSTICS\nENABLE CRC, SPI READ AND WRITE CHECKS\nENABLE LDO CHECKS, AND MORESETU P\n8 POSSIBLE ADC SETUPS\nSELECT FI LTER, OUTPUT D ATA RATE, GAIN AND MORECHANNE L CONFIGUR ATION\nSELECT POSITIVE AND NEG ATIVE INPUT FOR EACH ADC CHANNE L\nSELECT ONE OF 8 SETUPS FOR ADC CHANNE LA\nB\nC\nADC CONTRO L\nSELECT ADC OPER ATING MODE, CLOCK SOURCE,\nSELECT POWER MODE, D ATA + STATUS, AND MORED\n13048-072 \nFigure 68.

E | Page 41 of 94 ADC Setups  \nThe AD7124 -8 has eight independent setups. Each setup \nconsists of the following four registers:  \n• Configuration register  \n• Filter r egister  \n• Offset register  \n• Gain register  \nFor example, Setup 0 consists of Configuration Register 0, Filter \nRegister 0, Offset Register 0, and Gain Register 0. Figure 69 \nshows the grouping of these registers. The setup  is selectable \nfrom the channel registers detailed in the Channel Configuration  \nsection. This allows each channel to be assigned to one of eight  \nseparate setups. Table 41 through Table 44 show the four \nregisters that are associated with Setup  0. This structure is \nrepeated for Setup 1  to Setup 7 . \nConfiguration Registers  \nThe configuration registers allow the user to select the output  \ncoding of the ADC by selecting between bipolar and unipolar. In  bipolar mode, the ADC accepts negative differential input voltages,  \nand the output coding is offset binary. In unipolar mode, the ADC  \naccepts only positive differential voltages, and the coding is straight \nbinary. In either case, the input voltage must be within the AV DD \nand AV SS supply voltages. The user can also select the reference \nsource  using th ese register s. Four options are available: an \ninternal 2.5 V reference, an external reference con nected \nbetween REFIN1(+) and REFIN1(−), an external reference \nconnected between REFIN2(+) and REFIN2( −), or AV DD to AV SS. \nThe PGA gain is also set ; gains of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 \nare provided. The analog input buffers and reference input \nbuffers for the  setup can also be enabled using this register. \nFilter Registers  \nThe filter register s select which digital filter is used at the output \nof the ADC modulator. The filter type and the output data rate are selected by setting the bits in this register.

E | Page 42 of 94 Offset Registers  \nThe offset register s hold  the offset calibration coefficient for the \nADC. The power -on reset value of an offset register  is 0x800000. \nThe offset register s are  24-bit read/write register s. The power -\non reset value is automatically overwritten if an internal or \nsystem zero -scale calibration is initiated by the user or if the offset \nregisters  are written to by t he user.   \nGain Registers  \nThe gain register s are 24-bit register s that hold  the gain \ncalibration coefficient for the ADC. The gain registers are read/write registers. The gain is factory calibrated at a gain of 1 ; \nthus, the default value var ies from  device to device . The default \nvalue is automatically overwritten if a n internal or  system full -\nscale calibrat ion is initiated by the user. For more information \non calibration, see the Calibration  section.  \nDiagnostics  \nThe ERROR _EN register enables and disables the numerous \ndiagnostics on the AD7124- 8. By default, the SPI_IGNORE \nfunction is enabled , which indicates inappropriate times to \nwrite to  the ADC (for ex ample, during power -up and during a \nreset). Other diagnostics include  \n• SPI read and w rite checks , which ensure that only valid \nregisters are accessed  \n• SCLK counter , which ensures  that the correct  number of \nSCLK pulses are used  \n• SPI CRC  \n• Memory map CRC  \n• LDO checks When a diagnostic is enabled, the corresponding flag is contained \nin the e rror register. All enabled flags are OR ’ed to control the \nERR flag in the status register. Thus , if an error occurs (for example , \nthe SPI CRC check detects an error), the relevan t flag (for example, \nthe SPI_CRC_ERR flag ) in the error register is set. The ERR flag \nin the status register is also  set. This is useful when the status bits \nare appended to conversions. The ERR bit indicates if an error has \noccurred. The user can then rea d the error register for more \ndetail s on the error source.  \nThe frequency of the on -chip oscillator can also be monitored \non the AD7124 -8. The MCLK_C OUNT register  monitors the \nmaster clock puls es. Table 45 to Table 47 give more detail on the \ndiagnostic registers. See the Diagnostics  section for more detail \non the diagnost ics available.  \nADC Control Register  \nThe ADC control register configures  the core peripherals for use \nby the AD7124- 8 and the mode for the digital interface. The \npower mode (full power, m id po wer, or low power) is selected \nvia this register. Also, the mode of operation is selected , for example , \ncontinuous conversion or single conversion. The user can also \nselect the standby and power -down modes, as  well as any of the \ncalibration modes. In addit ion, this register contains the clock \nsource select bits and the internal reference enable bits. The \nreference select bits are contained in the setup configuration registers (see the ADC Setups  section for more inf ormation).  \nThe digital interface operation is also selected via the ADC \ncontrol register. This register allows the user to enable the data \nplus status read and continuous read mode. For more detail s, see \nthe Digital  Interface  section.

E | Page 43 of 94 Understanding Configuration Flexibility  \nIn Figure 70, Figure 71, and Figure 72, the registers shown in \nblack font are programmed for this configuration. The registers \nshown in gray font are redundant.  \nThe most straightforward implementation of the AD7124- 8 is \nto use differential inputs with adj acent analog inputs and run all \nof them with the same setup, gain correction, and offset correction  \nregister. For example, the user requires four differential inputs. \nIn this case, the user selects the following differential inputs: AIN0/  \nAIN1, AIN2/AIN3, AIN 4/AIN 5, AIN 6/AIN 7.  Programming the gain and offset registers is optional for any \nuse case, as indicated by the dashed lines between the register blocks. If an internal or system offset or full -scale calibration is \nperformed, the gain and offset regist ers for the selected channel \nare automatically updated.  \nAn alternative way to implement these four fully differential inputs is by taking advantage of the eight available setups. Motivation for this includes having a different speed , noise , or gain require ment on  \nsome of the four differential inputs vs. other inputs, or there may be a specific offset or gain correction for particular channels.  Figure 71 \nshows how each of the differential inputs can use a sepa rate se tup, \nallowing full flexibility in the configuration of each channel.  \nCONFIGUR ATION\nREGISTERSCHANNEL\nREGISTERS\nFILTER\nREGISTERSOFFSET\nREGISTERSGAIN\nREGISTERS\nSELECT PERIPHERAL\nFUNCTIONS FOR\nADC CHANNEL\nSELECT ANALOG INPUT PARTS\nENABLE THE CHANNEL\nSELECT SETUP 0SELECT DIGITAL\nFILTER TYPE\nAND OUTPUT DATA RATE\nANALOG INPUT BUFFERS\nREFERENCE BUFFERS\nBURNOUT\nREFERENCE SOURCE\nGAINSINC 4\nSINC 3\nSINC 4 + SINC 1\nSINC 3 + SINC 1\nENHANCED 50Hz/60Hz REJECTIONGAIN CORRECTION\nOPTIONALLY\nPROGRAMMED\nPER SETUP AS REQUIREDOFFSET CORRECTION\nOPTIONALLY PROGRAMMED\nPER SETUP AS REQUIRED0x19\n0x1A\n0x1B\n0x1C\n0x1D\n0x1E\n0x1F\n0x200x21\n0x22\n0x23\n0x24\n0x25\n0x26\n0x27\n0x280x31\n0x32\n0x33\n0x34\n0x35\n0x36\n0x37\n0x380x29\n0x2A\n0x2B\n0x2C\n0x2D\n0x2E\n0x2F\n0x30CONFIG_3\nCONFIG_5\nCONFIG_6\nCONFIG_7CONFIG_4CONFIG_0\nCONFIG_2CONFIG_1\nFILTER_3\nFILTER_5\nFILTER_6\nFILTER_7FILTER_4FILTER_0\nFILTER_2FILTER_1\nGAIN_3\nGAIN_5\nGAIN_6\nGAIN_7GAIN_4GAIN_0\nGAIN_2GAIN_1\nOFFSET_3\nOFFSET_5\nOFFSET_6\nOFFSET_7OFFSET_4OFFSET_0\nOFFSET_2OFFSET_10x09 CH0\n0x0A CH1\n0x0B CH2\n0x0C CH3\n0x0D CH4\n0x0E CH5\n0x0F CH6\n0x10 CH7\n0x11 CH8\n0x12 CH9\n0x13 CH10\n0x14 CH11\n0x15 CH12\n0x16 CH13\n0x17 CH14\n0x18 CH15AIN0\nAIN1\nAIN2\nAIN3\nAIN4\nAIN5\nAIN6\nAIN7\n13048-074 \nFigure 70.

Four Fully Dif ferential Inputs with a Separate  Setup per Channel  \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 44 of 94 Figure 72 shows an example of how the channel registers span \nbetween the analog input pins and the setup configurations \ndownstream. In this random example, two d ifferential inputs  and \ntwo single -ended inputs are required. The single -ended inputs  are \nthe AIN0/AIN7 and AIN6/AIN7 combinations. The first differen -\ntial input pair (AIN0/AIN1 ) uses Setup 0. The two single -ended \ninput pairs (AIN0/AIN7 and AIN6/AIN7) are s et up as diagnostics;  \ntherefore, they use a s eparate setup  (Setup 1). The final differential  \ninput (AIN2/AIN3) also uses a separate setup: Setup 2.  \nGiven that three setups are selected for use, the CONFIG_ 0, \nCONFIG_ 1, and CONFIG_ 2 registers are programmed  as \nrequired, and the FILTER_ 0, FILTER_ 1, and FILTER _2 registers \nare also programmed as required . Optional gain and offset \ncorrection can be employed on a per setup basis by programming the GAIN_0, GAIN_1, and GAIN_2 registers \nand the OFFSET_ 0, OFFSET_ 1, and OFFSET_ 2 registers. \nIn the example shown in Figure 72, the CHANNEL_ 0 to \nCHANNEL_ 3 registers are used. Setting the MSB (the enable   \nbit) in each of these registers enables the four combinations via  \nthe crosspoin t multiplexer . When the AD7124- 8 converts, the \nsequencer transitions in ascending sequential order from CHANNEL_ 0 to CHANNEL_ 1 to CHANNEL_ 2, and then on \nto CHANNEL_ 3 before looping back to CHA NNEL_ 0 to repeat \nthe sequence.  \n \n  \n \nCONFIGUR ATION\nREGISTERSFILTER\nREGISTERSOFFSET\nREGISTERSGAIN\nREGISTERS\nSELECT PERIPHERAL\nFUNCTIONS FOR\nADC CHANNEL\nSELECT ANALOG INPUT PARTS\nENABLE THE CHANNEL\nSELECT SETUPSELECT DIGITAL\nFILTER TYPE\nAND OUTPUT DATA RATE\nANALOG INPUT BUFFERS\nREFERENCE BUFFERS\nBURNOUT\nREFERENCE SOURCE\nGAINSINC4\nSINC 3\nSINC 4 + SINC 1\nSINC 3 + SINC 1\nENHANCED 50Hz/60Hz REJECTIONGAIN CORRECTION\nOPTIONALLY\nPROGRAMMED\nPER SETUP AS REQUIREDOFFSET CORRECTION\nOPTIONALLY PROGRAMMED\nPER SETUP AS REQUIRED0x19\n0x1A\n0x1B\n0x1C\n0x1D\n0x1E\n0x1F\n0x200x21\n0x22\n0x23\n0x24\n0x25\n0x26\n0x27\n0x280x31\n0x32\n0x33\n0x34\n0x35\n0x36\n0x37\n0x380x29\n0x2A\n0x2B\n0x2C\n0x2D\n0x2E\n0x2F\n0x30CONFIG_3\nCONFIG_5\nCONFIG_6\nCONFIG_7CONFIG_4CONFIG_0\nCONFIG_ 2CONFIG_ 1\nFILTER_3\nFILTER_5\nFILTER_6\nFILTER_7FILTER_4FILTER_ 0\nFILTER_ 2FILTER_ 1\nGAIN_3\nGAIN_5\nGAIN_6\nGAIN_7GAIN_4GAIN_0\nGAIN_2GAIN_1\nOFFSET_3\nOFFSET_5\nOFFSET_6\nOFFSET_7OFFSET_4OFFSET_0\nOFFSET_2OFFSET_10x09 CHANNEL_0\n0x0A CHANNEL_1\n0x0B CHANNEL_2\n0x0C CHANNEL_3\n0x0D CHANNEL_4\n0x0E CHANNEL_5\n0x0F CHANNEL_6\n0x10 CHANNEL_7\nCHANNEL_8\nCHANNEL_9\nCHANNEL_10\nCHANNEL_11\nCHANNEL_12\nCHANNEL_13\nCHANNEL_14\nCHANNEL_15AIN0\nAIN1AIN2\nAIN3\nAIN4\nAIN5\nAIN6\nAIN7CHANNEL\nREGISTERS\n0x11\n0x12\n0x13\n0x14\n0x15\n0x16\n0x17\n0x18\n13048-076 \nFigure 72.

This feature allows the user to perform \ndiagnostics  such as checking that pins are connected. It a lso \nsimplifies printed  circuit board (PCB) design. For example, \nthe same PCB can accommodate 2 -wire, 3 -wire , and 4 -wire \nresistance temperature detectors ( RTDs ). \nAIN0\nAIN1AVDD\nAVDD\nAVSSAVSS\nAVSSAVDD\nAVSS\nAIN14AVDD\nAIN15AVDD\nAVSSPGA TO ADCBURNOUT\nCURRENTS\n13048-077 \nFigure 73. Analog Input Multiplexer Circuit  \n The channels are confi gured using the AINP [4:0] bits and the \nAINM [4:0]  bits in the c hannel registers (see  Table 49). The device  \ncan be configured to have 8  differential inputs, 15 pseudo dif -\nferential  inputs , or a combination of both. W hen using differential \ninputs, use adjacent analog input pins to form the input pair. Using \nadjacent pins minimizes any mismatch between the channels.  \nThe inputs can be buffered or unbuffered at a gain of 1 but are \nautomatically buffered when the gain exc eeds 1. The AINP and \nAINM  buffers are enabled/disabled separately using the AIN_BUFP  \nand AIN_BUFM bits in the configuration register (see Table 50). \nIn buffered mode, the input channel feeds into a high impedance \ninput stage of the buffer amplifier. Therefore, the input can tolerate \nsignificant source impedances and is tailored for direct connection \nto external resistive type sensors such as strain gages or RTDs.  \nWhen the device is operated in unbuffered mode, the device has a higher analog input current. Note that this unbuffered input path provides a dynamic load to the driving source. Therefore, \nresistor/capacitor  (RC) combinations on the input pins can \ncause gain errors, depending on the output impedance of the \nsource that is driving the ADC input.  \nThe absolute input voltage in unbuffered mode ( gain = 1) \nincludes the range between AV\nSS − 50 mV and AV DD + 50 mV . \nThe absolute input voltage range in buffered mode at a gain of 1 is restricted to a range between AV\nSS + 100 mV and AV DD − 100  m V.  \nThe common -mode voltage must  not exceed these limits; \notherwise, linearity and noise performance d egrade.  \nWhen the gain is greater than 1, the analog input buffers are automatically enabled. The PGA placed in front of the input buffers is rail -to-rail; thus, in this case, the absolute input voltage \nincludes the range from AV\nSS − 50 mV to AV DD +  5 0  m V.   \nTable 49.

E | Page 46 of 94 EXTERNAL IMPEDANCE WHEN USING A GAIN OF 1 \nWhen a gain of 1 is used, the PGA is powered down, reducing \nthe current consumption. A capacitive network is included at \nthe PGA output for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) purposes. For a gain of 1, this capacitive network is connected \ndirectly to the analog input pins as the PGA is bypassed (see \nFigure 76). A precharge buffer is included on the AD7124-8  \nB grade to charge this capacitive network quickly when switching channels. The precharge buffer ensures that the analog input is \nsettled when sampled by the ADC. \nWhen using the AD7124-8 , which does not include the \nprecharge buffer, using large external loads at a gain of 1 in multiplexed applications affects the settling time. Large external \nloads affect the initial error on the gain of 1 channel. The \nexternal RC antialiasing filter determines the recovery time of the channel. When the gain of 1 channel is selected, the \nmaximum possible error (initial error) is \nV\nERROR  = CPAR × (VIN_PREV_CH  × GAIN_PREV_CH  − VIN) ÷ \n(CPAR + CFILT)  (1) \nwhere: \nCPAR is the internal capacitance (63 pF due to 10 pF/25 pF \nnetwork plus 3 pF of parasitic capacitance). \nCFILT is the external filter capacitance on the gain of 1 channel. \nVIN_PREV_CH  is the input voltage of the previous selected channel. \nGAIN_PREV_CH  is the gain of the previous selected channel. \nIf a fast output data rate is selected, the error in the conversion \nhas a magnitude comparable with Equation 1. For slower output data rates, the error is reduced as the ADC takes more time to process the analog input, which allows the front end to settle. \nThe settling time is dependent on the time constant of the \nexternal antialiasing filter.  \nFigure 74 and Figure 75 show the error for different RC filter \ncombinations on the gain of 1 channel when a resistor attenuator is connected to the analog input and the ADC is \nmultiplexed.  6000ERROR (µV)5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n–1000\n1 10 100 1000 10000\nSETTLED OUTPUT DATA RATE (sps)RC: 100Ω RESISTOR\n        1µF CAPICITOR\n        0.01µF CAPACITOR TO GND\nRC: 100Ω RESISTOR\n        0.1µF CAPICITOR\n        0.01µF CAPICITOR TO GND\nRC: 100Ω RESISTOR\n        0.01µF CAPICITOR\n        0.01µF CAPICITOR TO GND\n13048-175 \nFigure 74.

Error vs. Settled Output Data Rate  (47 kΩ Resistors in Attenuator Circuit) \nFigure 74 and Figure 75 show that, at low output data rates, the \nADC allows sufficient time for the gain of 1 channel to settle for \nany external load resistance and RC filter values. At intermediate \noutput data rates, reducing the values of the external RC compo-nents reduces the time constant of the external filter so that the analog input can settle within the allowed time. For high output data rates, the settling time allowed by the ADC is short; therefore, a large capacitor from AINP to AINM minimizes the error. \nFor gains > 1, the PGA is used, which isolates the internal \ncapacitive network from the analog input pins. Therefore, for \ngains > 1, there are no restrictions on the external circuitry.  \nBUFFERPGA2MUXADC\n13048-07810pF10pFAVSSBUFFER AD7124-8\nAVSS25pFAINP\nAINMAVSSRC ANTIALIASING\nFILTER\nAVSSAVSSATTENU ATOR\nCIRCUIT\n \nFigure 76.

PGA  \nThe AD7124 -8 can be programmed to have a gain of 1, 2, 4, 8, \n16, 32, 64, or  128 by using t he PGA bits in the configuration \nregister (see Table 50). The PGA consists of two stages. For a \ngain of 1, both stages are bypassed. For gains of 2 to 8, a single stage i s used , whereas  for gains greater than 8 , both stages are used .  \nThe analog input range is ±V\nREF/gain.  Therefore, with an external \n2.5 V reference,  the unipolar ranges are from 0 mV to 19.53 mV \nto 0 V to 2.5 V , and the bipolar ranges are from ±19.53 mV to ±2.5 V . For high reference values, for examp le, V\nREF = AV DD, the \nanalog input range must be limited. Consult the Specifications  \nsection for more detail s on the se limits. \nREFERENCE  \nThe AD7124 -8 has an embedded 2.5 V reference. The embedded  \nreference is a low noise, low drift reference with 15  ppm/°C drift \nmaximum on the AD7124 -8 and 10  ppm /°C drift maximum on \nthe AD7124- 8 B grade . Including the reference on the AD7124 -8 \nreduces  the number of external components needed in applications  \nsuch as thermocouple s, lea ding to a reduced PCB size.   \nBAND GA P\nREF\n24-BIT\nΣ-ΔADCREFIN1(+)\nREFOUTREFIN1(–)\nREFIN2(+)\nREFIN2(–)AVDD\nAVSSAVSS\nREFERENCE\nBUFFERS\n13048-081 \nFigure 78. Reference Connections  \nThis reference can be used to supply the ADC (by setting the REF_EN bit in the ADC_CONTROL  register to 1) or an  external \nreference can be applied. For external referen ces, the ADC has a \nfully differential input capability for the channel. In addition, the user can select one of two external reference options  (REFIN1 \nor REFIN2). The reference source for the A D7124 -8 is selected \nusing the REF_SEL bits in the configuration register (see Table 50). \nWhen the internal reference is selected, it is internally  connected \nto the modulator. It can also be made available on the R EFOUT pin. A 0.1 µ F decoupling capacitor is required on REFOUT \nwhen the internal reference is active.  \nThe common -mode range for the differential reference inputs is \nfrom AV\nSS − 50 mV to AV DD + 50 mV when the reference buffers \nare disabled. The reference inputs can also be buffered on -chip. \nThe buffers require 100 mV of headroom.  The reference voltage \nof REFIN (REFINx(+) − REFINx(−)) is 2.5 V nominal, but the AD7124 -8 is functional with reference voltages from 0.5 V to \nAV\nDD.  \nIn applications where the excitation (voltage or current) for the \ntransducer on the analog input also drives the reference voltage \nfor the devices, the effect of the low frequency noise in the excita -\ntion source is removed, because the application is  ratiometric. If \nthe AD7124- 8 is used in nonratiometric applications, use a low \nnoise  reference.  \nThe r ecommended 2.5 V reference voltage sources for the AD7124- 8 \ninclude the ADR4525 , which is a low noise, low powe r reference . \nNote that the reference input provides a high impedance, dynamic \nload when unbuffered. Because the input impedance of each \nreference input is dynamic, resistor/capacitor combination s on \nthese inputs can cause dc gain errors if the reference in puts are \nunbuffered, depending on the output impedance of the source driving the reference inputs.  \nReference voltage sources typically have low output impedances \nand are, therefore, tolerant to having decoupling capacitors on \nREFIN x(+) without introducing gain errors in the system. Deriving \nthe reference input voltage across an external resistor means that \nthe reference input sees a significant external source impedance. \nIn this situation, using the reference buffers is required.  \nREFINx(+)\n1µF 4.7µFADR4525\n2.5V REF\nREFINx(–)0.1µF 4.7µF3V\n13048-082 \nFigure 79. ADR4525 to AD7124- 8 Connections  \nBIPOLAR/UNIPOLAR CONFIGURATION  \nThe analog input to the AD7124 -8 can accept either unipolar or \nbipolar input voltage ranges , which allows the user to tune the \nADC input range to the sensor output range. When a split power supply is used, the device accepts truly bipolar inputs. When a single power supply is used, a bipolar input range does not imply that the device  can tolerate negative voltages with \nrespect to system AV\nSS. Unipolar and bipolar signals on the \nAIN P input are referenced to the voltage on the AIN M input. \nFor exampl e, if AIN M is 1.5 V and the ADC is configured for \nunipolar mode with a gain of 1, the input voltage range on the \nAIN P input  is 1.5  V to 3 V when V REF = AV DD = 3 V. If the ADC \nis configured for bipolar mode, the analog input range on the \nAIN P input is 0 V t o AV DD. The bipolar/unipolar option is chosen \nby programming the bipolar  bit in the configuration register.  \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 48 of 94 DATA OUTPUT CODING  \nWhen the ADC is configured for unipolar operation, the output \ncode is natural (straight) binary with a zero differential input \nvoltage resulting in a code of 00  … 00, a mi dscale voltage resulting  \nin a code of 100  … 000, and a full -scale input voltage resulting \nin a code of 111  … 111. The output code for any analog input \nvoltage can be represented as  \nCode  = (2N × AIN × Gain)/VREF \nWhen the ADC is configured for bipolar operation, the output \ncode is offset binary with a negative full -scale voltage resulting \nin a code of 000  … 000, a zero differential input voltage resulting \nin a code of 100  … 000, and a positive full -scale input volta ge \nresulting in a code of 111 … 111. The output code for any \nanalog input voltage can be represented as  \nCode  = 2N − 1 × [(AIN × Gain/VREF) + 1]  \nwhere:  \nN = 24. \nAIN is the analog input voltage.  \nGain is the gain  setting (1 to 128).  \nEXCITATION CURRENTS  \nThe AD7124 -8 also contains two matched, software configu rable, \nconstant current sources that can be programmed to equal 50  µA, \n100 µA, 250 µA, 500 µA, 750 µA , or 1 mA. These current sources \ncan be used to excite external resistive bridges or RTD sensors. \nBoth current sources source currents from AV DD and can be  \ndirected to any of the analog input pins (see Figure 80).  \nThe pins on which the currents are made available are programmed  \nusing the IOUT1_CH and IOUT0_CH bits in the IO_C ONTROL _1 \nregister (see Table 51). The magnitude of each current source is \nindividually programmable using the IOUT1 and IOUT0 bits in \nthe IO_C ONTROL _1 register. In addition, b oth currents can be \noutp ut to the same analog input pin .  \nNote that the on -chip reference does not need to be enabled \nwhen using the excitation currents.

Excitation Current and Bias Voltage Connections  \nBRIDGE POWER -DOWN SWITCH  \nIn bridge  applications such as strain ga ges and load cells, the \nbridge itself consumes the majority of the current in the system. \nFor example, a 350 Ω load cell requires 8.6 mA o f current when \nexcited with a 3 V supply. To minimize the current consumption  of \nthe system, the bridge can be disconnected (when it is not being \nused) using the bridge power -down switch. The switch can  with -\nstand 30 mA of continuous current, and it has an on r esistance \nof 10 Ω maximum. The PDSW bit in the IO_C ONTROL _1 \nregister controls the switch.  \nLOGIC OUTPUTS  \nThe AD7124 -8 has four general -purpose digital outputs: P1 \nto P4. These are enabled using the GPIO_CTRL bits in the \nIO_CONTROL_1 register (see Table 51). The pins can be \npulled high or low using the GPIO_DATx bits in the register; \nthat is, the value at the pin is determined by the setting of the GPIO_DATx bits. The logic levels for these pins are determined by AV\nDD rather than by IOV DD. When the IO_CONTROL_1 \nregister is read, the GPIO_DATx bit s reflect the actual value at \nthe pins; this is useful for short -circuit detection.  \nTable 51.

E | Page 49 of 94 These pins can be used to drive external circuitry, for example, \nan external multiplexer. If an ex ternal multiplexer is used to \nincrease the channel count, the multiplexer logic pins can be \ncontrolled via the AD7124 -8 general -purpose output pins. The \ngeneral -purpose output pins can be used  to select the active \nmultiplexer pin. Because the operation of the multiplexer is independent of the AD7124- 8, reset the modulator and filter \nusing the \nSYNC  pin or by writing  to the mode or configuration \nregister each time that the multiplexer channel is changed.  \nBIAS VOLTAGE GENERAT OR \nA bias voltage generator is included on the AD7124- 8 (see \nFigure 80). It biases the negative terminal of the selected input \nchannel to ( AV DD − AV SS)/2. This function is  useful in thermocou -\nple a pplications, as the voltage generated by the thermocouple \nmust be biased around  some dc voltage if the ADC operates from a \nsingle power supply. The bias voltage generator is controlled using \nthe VBIAS x bits in the IO_C ONTROL _2 register (see  Table 53). \nThe power -up time of the bias voltage generator is dependent \non the load capacitance. Consult the Specifications  section fo r \nmore detail s. \nCLOCK  \nThe AD7124 -8 includes an internal 614.4 kHz clock on chip. \nThis internal clock has a tolerance of ± 5%. Use either the \ninternal clock or an external clock as the clock sou rce to the \nAD7124- 8. The clock source is selected using the CLK_SEL bits \nin the ADC_CONTROL register (see Table 54).  \nThe internal clock can also be m ade available at the CLK pin.  This \nis useful when several ADCs are used in an application and the devices must be synchronized. The internal clock from one  device \ncan be used as the clock source for all ADCs in the  system. Using a \ncommon clock, the devices  can be synchronized by applying a \ncommon reset to all devices, or the \nSYNC  pin can be pulsed.  \nPOWER MODES  \nThe AD7124 -8 has three power modes: full power mode, mid \npowe r mode, and low power mode. The mode is selected using \nthe POWER_MODE bits in the ADC_CONTROL register. The power mode affects the power consumption of the device as \nwell as changing the master clock frequency. A 614.4 kHz clock \nis used by the device. Howe ver, this clock is internally divided, \nthe division factor being dependent on the power mode. Thus , the range of output data rates and performance is affected by the power mode.  \nTable 52.

The LDOs \nremain active so that registers maintain their contents. If \nenabled, the reference, internal oscillator, digital outputs P1 to \nP4, the bias voltage generator and the low -side power swi tch \nremain active. On the AD7124 -8 B grade , the excitation currents , \nif enabled, also  remain active in standby mode. The excitation \ncurrents  are disabled  on the AD7124- 8. These blocks can be \ndisabled, if required, by setting the corresponding bits \nappropriately. The reference detection and LDO capacitor detection function s are disabled in standby mode.  \nOther diagnostics remain acti ve if enabled when the ADC is in \nstandby mode. Diagnostics can be enabled or disabled while in standby mode. However, any diagnostics that require the master clock ( reference detect, und ervoltage/overvoltage detection, \nLDO trip tests, memory map CRC, and M CLK counter) must \nbe enabled when the ADC is in continuous conversion mode or idle mode; these diagnostics do not function if enabled in standby mode.  \nThe standby current is typically 15 µA when the LDOs only are enabled. If functions such as the bias voltage generator remain active in standby mode, the current increases by 36 µA typically. \nIf the internal oscillator remains active in standby mode, the \ncurrent increases by 22 µA typically. When exiting standby \nmode, the AD7124- 8 requires 130 MCLK cycles to power up \nand settle . The internal oscillator, if disabled in standby mode, \nrequires an additional 40 µs to power up and settle. If an external \nmaster clock is being used, ensure that it is ac tive before issuing \nthe command to exit standby mode. Do not write to the ADC_ \nCONTROL register again until the ADC has powered up and settled.  \n \nTable 53. I nput/ Output  Control 2 Register  \nReg.

E | Page 50 of 94 In power -down mode, all blocks are powered down, including  \nthe LDOs. All registers lose their contents, and the digital outputs \nP1 to P4 are placed in tristate. To prevent accidental entry to power -down  mode, the ADC must first be placed into standby \nmode. If an external master clock is being used, keep it active until the device is placed in power -down mode. Exiting power -\ndown mode requires 64 SCLK cycles with \nCS = 0 and DIN = 1, \nthat is, a serial interface reset. The AD7124 -8 requires 2 ms \ntypically to power up and settle. The POR_FLAG in the status register can be monitored to determine the end of the power up/settling period. After this time, the user can access the on -chip \nregisters. The power -down current is 2 µA typically.   \nDIGITAL INTERFACE  \nThe programmable functions of the AD7124- 8 are controlled \nusing a set of on -chip registers. Data is written to these registers \nvia the serial interface. Read access to the on -chip registers is \nalso provided by this interface. All communications with the \ndevice  must start with a write to the communications register. \nAfter power -on or reset, the device expects a write to its \ncommunications register. The data written to this re gister \ndetermines whether the next operation is a read operation or a \nwrite operation, and determines to which register this read or write operation occurs. Therefore, write access to any of the other registers on the device s begins with a write operation to \nthe communications register, followed by a write to the selected \nregister. A read operation from any other register (except when \ncontinuous read mode is selected) starts with a write to the communications register, followed by a read operation from the \nselected register.  \nThe serial interface of the AD7124- 8 consists of four signals: \nCS, \nDIN, SCLK, and DOUT/ RDY . The DIN line transfer s data into \nthe on -chip registers, wh ereas  DOUT/ RDY  access es data from \nthe on -chip registers. SCLK is the serial clock input for the \ndevice, and all data transfers (either on DIN or DOUT/ RDY ) \noccur with respect to the SCLK signal. The DOUT/ RDY  pin \nalso operates as a data ready signal; the line goes low when a \nnew data -word is available in the output register. It is reset high \nwhen a read operation from the data register is complete. It also \ngoes high b efore  the data register updates to indicate when not \nto read from the device, to ensure that a data read is not attempted  \nwhile the register is being updated. CS is used to select a device. \nIt can decode the AD7124 -8 in systems where several components \nare connected to the serial bus.  \nFigure 3 and Figure 4 show timing diagrams for interf acing to \nthe AD7124 -8 with CS decoding the device s. Figure 3 shows the \ntiming  for a read operation from the output shift regis ter of the \nAD7124 -8. Figure 4 shows the timing for a write operation to \nthe input shift register. A delay is required between consecutive \nSPI communic ations. Figure 5 shows the delay required between \nSPI r ead/write operations. It is possible to read the same word \nfrom the data register several times, even though the \nDOUT/ RDY  line returns hi gh after the first read operation. \nHowever, care must be taken to ensure that the read operations are complete before the next output update occurs. In continuous \nread mode, the data register can be read only once.  \nThe serial interface can operate in 3 -wire mode by tying CS low. \nIn this case, the SCLK, DIN, and DOUT/ RDY  lines communicate  \nwith the AD7124 -8. The end of the conversion can be monitored  \nusing the RDY  bit in the status register. This scheme is su itable \nfor interfacing to micro controllers. If CS is required as a decoding \nsignal, it can be generated from a port pin. For microcontroller \ninterface s, it is recommended that SCLK idle high between data \ntransfers.  \nThe AD7124 -8 can be operated with CS being used as a frame \nsynchronization signal. This scheme is usefu l for DSP interfaces.  \nIn this case, the first bit (MSB) is effectively clocked out by CS, \nbecause CS normally occurs after the falling edge of SCLK in \nDSPs. SCLK can continue to run between data transfers, \nprov ided the timing numbers are obeyed.  \nCS must be used to frame read and write operations and the  \nCS_EN bit in the ADC_C ONTROL  register must be set when \nthe diagnostics SPI_READ_ERR, SPI_WRITE_ERR , or \nSPI_SCLK_C NT_ERR are enabled.  \nThe serial interface can be reset by writing a series of 1s on the \nDIN input. See the Reset  section for more detail s. Reset returns \nthe interface to the state in which it is expecting a write to  the \ncommunications register  \nThe AD7124 -8 can be configured  to continuously convert or \nperform a single conversion (see Figure 81 through Figure 83). \nSingle Conversion Mode  \nIn single conversion mode, the AD7124- 8 performs a single \nconversion and is placed in standby  mode after the conversion \nis com plete . If a master clock is present (external master clock \nor the internal oscillator is enabled), DOUT/ RDY  goes low to \nindicate the completion of a conversion . When the data -word is \nread from the data register, DOUT/ RDY  goes high. The data \nregister can be read several times, if required, even when \nDOUT/ RDY  is high.  Do not read the ADC_ CONTROL register \nclose to the completion of a conversion because  the mode bits are \nbeing updated by the A DC to indicate that the ADC is in standby \nmode.  \nIf several channels are enabled, the ADC automatically  sequences \nthrough the enabled channels and performs a conversion on each channel. When a conversion is started, DOUT/\nRDY  goes \nhigh and remains high until a valid conversion is available and \nCS is low. As soon as the conversion is available, DOUT/ RDY  \ngoes low. The ADC then selects the next channel and begins a \nconversion. The user can read the present conversion whi le the \nnext conversion is being performed. As soon as the next conver -\nsion is complete, the data register is updated; therefore, the user has a limited period in which to read the conversion. When the \nADC has performed a single conver sion on each of the selected \nchannels, it returns to standby  mode.  \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev. E | Page 51 of 94 If the DATA_STATUS bit in the ADC_C ONTROL  register is set \nto 1, the contents of the status register are output along with the \nconversion each time that the data read is performed. The four LSBs of the status register indicate the channel to which the conver -\nsion corresponds. \nContinuous Conversion Mode  \nContinuous conversion is the default power -up mode. The \nAD7124- 8 converts cont inuously, and the RDY  bit in the status \nregister goes low each time a conversion is complete. If CS is low,  \nthe DOUT/ RDY  line also goes low when a conversion is complete.  \nTo read a conver sion, write to the communications register, \nindicating that the next operation is a read of the data register. \nWhen the data -word is read from the data register,  DOUT/ RDY  \ngoes high. The user can read this register additional times, i f \nrequired. However, the user must ensure that the data register is \nnot being accessed at the completion of the next con version; \notherwise the new conversion word is lost.  When several channels are enabled, the ADC automatically \nsequences through the enab led channels, performing one \nconversion on each channel. When all channels are  converted, \nthe sequence starts again with the first channel. The channels \nare converted in order from lowest enabled channel to highest enabled channel. The data register is upd ated as soon as each \nconversion is available. The DOUT/\nRDY  pin pulses low each \ntime a conversion is available. The user can then read the \nconversion while the ADC converts the next enabled channel . \nIf the DATA_STATUS bit in the ADC_C ONTROL register is set \nto 1, the contents of the status register, along with the conversion data,  are output each time the data register is read. The status \nregister indicates the channel to which the conversion corresponds.  \n \nDIN\nSCLKDOUT/RDYCS\n0x01 0x0004 0x42\nDATA\n13048-087 \nFigure 81.

E | Page 52 of 94 Continuous Read  Mode  \nIn continuous read mode, it is not required to wri te to the \ncommunications register before reading ADC data; apply the \nrequired number of SCLKs after DOUT/ RDY  goes low to \nindicate the end of a conversion. When the conversion is read, DOUT/\nRDY  returns high unti l the next conversion is available. \nIn this mode, the data can be read only once. Ensure that the data -\nword is read before the next conversion is complete. If the user \nhas not read the conversion before the completion of the next \nconversion , or if insuffic ient serial clocks are applied to the \nAD7124- 8 to read the word, the serial output register is reset \nwhen the next conversion is complete, and the new conversion \nis placed in the output serial  register. The ADC must be configured \nfor continuous conversion mode to use continuous read mode.  \nTo enable continuous read mode, set the CONT_READ bit in the ADC_ CONTROL  register. When this bit is set, the only serial \ninterface  operations possible are rea ds from the data register. To \nexit continuous read mode , write a read data command (0x42) \nwhile the DOUT/\nRDY  pin is low. Alternatively, apply a software  \nreset, that is, 64 SCLKs with CS = 0 and DIN = 1. This r esets the \nADC and all register contents. These are the only commands that the interface recognizes after it is placed in continuous read mode. DIN must  be held low in continuous read mode until an \ninstruction is to be written to the device.  \nIf multiple AD C channels are enabled, each channel is output in \nturn, with the status bits being appended to the data if DATA_  \nSTATUS  is set in the ADC_ CONTROL  register. The status \nregister indicates the channel to which the conversion corresponds.  \nDATA_S TATUS  \nThe conte nts of the status register can be appended to each \nconversion on the AD7124 -8. This is a useful function if several \nchannels are enabled. Each time a conversion is output, the contents of the status register are appended. The four LSBs of the status register indicate to which channel the conversion corresponds. In addition, the user can determine if any errors \nare being flagged via the ERROR_FLAG bit. To append the status \nregister contents to e very conversion, the DATA_STATUS bit in \nthe ADC_C ONTROL  register is set to 1 . \nSERIAL INTERFACE RES ET (DOUT_ RDY _DEL AND \nCS_EN BITS)  \nThe instant at which the DOUT/ RDY  pin changes from being a \nDOUT pin to a RDY  pin is programmable on the AD7124 -8. By \ndefault, the DOUT/ RDY  pin changes functionality after a period of \ntime following the last SCLK rising edge, th e SCLK edge on which \nthe LSB is read by the processor. This time is 10 ns minimum  by \ndefault and, by setting the DOUT_ RDY _DEL bit in the ADC_  \nCONTROL  register to 1, can be extended to 1 10 ns minimum .  \n \n By setting the CS_EN bit in the ADC_ CONTROL  register to 1, the \nDOUT/ RDY  pin continues to output the LSB of the register \nbeing read until CS is taken high. This configuration is useful if \nthe CS signal is used to frame a ll read operations. If CS is not \nused to frame all read operations, set CS_EN to 0 so that \nDOUT/ RDY  changes functionality following the last SCLK \nedge in the read operation.  \nCS_EN must  be set to 1 and the CS signal must be used to frame all \nread and write operations when the SPI_READ_ERR, \nSPI_WRITE_ERR , and SPI_SCLK_CNT_ERR diagnostic \nfunctions  are enabled.  \nThe serial interface is always reset on the CS rising edge , that is , \nthe interface is reset to a known state whereby it awaits a write \nto the communications register. Therefore, if a read or write \noperation is performed by performing multiple 8 - bit data \ntransfers,  CS must  be held low until the all bits are transferred.  \nRESET  \nThe circuitry and serial interface of the AD7124 -8 can be reset \nby writing 64 consecutive 1s to the device. This resets the logic, \nthe digital filter, and the analog modulator, and all on -chip \nregisters are reset to their default values. A reset is automatically performed on power -up. A reset requires a time of 90 MCLK \ncycles . The POR_FLAG bit in the status register is set to 1 when \nthe reset is in itiated  and the n is set to 0 when the reset is  complete . \nA reset is useful if the serial interface becomes asynchronous \ndue to noise on the SCLK line.  \nCALIBRATION  \nThe AD7124 -8 provides four ca libration modes that can be \nused to eliminate the offset and gain errors on a per setup basis:  \n• Internal zero -scale calibration mode  \n• Internal full -scale calibration mode  \n• System zero -scale calibration mode  \n• System full -scale calibration mode  \nOnly one channel  can be active during calibration. After each \nconversion, the ADC conversion result is scaled using the ADC \ncalibration registers before being written to the data register.  \nThe default value of the offset register is 0x800000, and the nominal \nvalue of the gain register is 0x5XXXXX . The calibration range \nof the ADC gain is from 0.4 × V REF/gain to 1.05 × V REF/gain.  \nThe following equations show the calculations that are used  in \neach calibration mode . In unipolar mode, the ideal \nrelationship —that is, not taki ng into account the ADC gain \nerror and offset error —is as follows:  \n20x400000) 0x800000 ( 275.023\n××\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb−−××=\nGainOffsetVVData\nREFIN\n \n \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev. E | Page 53 of 94 In bipolar mode, the ideal relationship —that is, not taking into \naccount the ADC gain error and offset error —is as follows:  \n0x8000000x4000000x800000) ( 20.7523\n+×\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb−−××=\nGainOffsetVVData\nREFIN\n \nTo start a calib ration, write the relevant value to the m ode bits \nin the ADC_C ONTROL register. The DOUT/ RDY  pin and the \nRDY  bit in the status register go high when the calibration \ninitiates. When the calibration is complete, the co ntents of the \ncorresponding offset or gain register are updated, the RDY  bit \nin the status register is reset, the DOUT/ RDY  pin returns low (if \nCS is low), and the AD7124 -8 reverts to idle  mode.  \nDuring an internal o ffset calibration, the selected positive \nanalog input pin is disconnected, and it is  connected internally \nto the selected negative analog input pin. For this reason, it is \nnecessary to ensure that the voltage on the selected negative \nanalog input pin does not exceed the allowed limits and is free from excessive noise and interference.  \nTo perform an internal full -scale calibration, a full -scale input \nvoltage is automatically con nected to the selected analog input \nfor this calibration. A full -scale calibration is recommended \neach time the gain of a channel is changed to minimize the full -\nscale error. When performing internal calibrations, the internal full-scale calibration must b e performed before the internal \nzero -scale calibration. Therefore, write the value 0x800000 to \nthe offset register before performing the internal full -scale \ncalibration, which ensures that the offset register is at its default value.  The AD7124 -8 is factory calibrated at a gain of 1 , and the \nresulting gain coefficient is the default gain coefficient on the device . The device  does not support further internal full -scale \ncalibrations at a gain of  1. \nSystem calibrations expect the system zero -scale (offset) and \nsystem full -scale (gain) voltages to be applied to the ADC pins \nbefore initiating the calibration modes. As a result, errors external to the ADC are removed. The system zero -scale \ncalibratio n must be performed before the system full -scale \ncalibrati on. \nFrom an operational point of view, treat a calibration like another ADC conversion. Set the system software to monitor \nthe \nRDY  bit in the status register or the DOUT/ RDY  pin to \ndetermine the end of a calibration via a polling sequence or an \ninterrupt -driven routine.  \nAn internal/system offset calibration and system full -scale \ncalibration requires a time equal to the settling time of the selected filter to be completed. The internal full -scale \ncalibration requires a  time equal to four settling periods (gain > 1).  \nA calibration can be performed at any output data  rate. Using \nlower output data rates results in better calibration accuracy and \nis accurate for al l output data rates. A new calibration  is required for a given channel if the reference source or the gain for that \nchannel is changed.  \nOffset and system full -scale calibrations can be performed in \nany power mode. Internal full -scale calibrations can be p erformed \nin the low power or mid power modes only. Thus , when using \nfull power mode, the user must  select mid or low power mode \nto perform the internal full -scale calibration. However, an interna l \nfull-scale calibration performed in low  or mid power mode i s \nvalid in full power mode, if th e same gain is  used.  \nThe offset error is typically ±15 µV for gains of 1 to 8 and  \n±200/gain\n µV for higher output data rates. An internal or system \noffset calibration reduces the offset error to the order of the \nnoise. The g ain error is factory calibrated at ambient temperature \nand at a gain of 1. Following this calibration, the gain error is \n±0.002 5% maximum. Therefore, internal full -scale calibrations \nat a gain of 1 are not supported on the AD7124 -8. For other \ngains, the gain error is − 0.3%. An internal full -scale calibration at \nambient temperature reduces  the gain error to ± 0.016%  \nmaximum for gains of 2 to 8 and ±0.025% typically for higher \ngains. A system full -scale calibration  reduces the gain error to the \norder of the noise.  \nThe AD7124 -8 provides the user with access to the on -chip \ncalibration registers, allowing the microprocessor to read the \ncalibration coefficients of the device and to write its own \ncalibration coefficients from prestored values in the EEPROM . \nA read or write of the offset and gain registers can be performed at any time except during an internal or self -calibration. The \nvalues in the calibration registers are 24 bits wide. The span and \noffset of the device can also be manipulated using the registers.  \nSPAN AND OFFSET LIMI TS \nWhenever a system calibration mode is used, the amount of \noffset and span that can be accommodated is limit ed. The \noverriding requirement in determining the amount of offset \nand gain that can be accommodated by the device  is the \nrequirement that the positive full -scale calibration limit is  \n≤1.05 × VREF/gain. This allows the input range to go 5% above \nthe nominal range. The built -in headroom in the AD7124 -8 \nanalog modulator ensures that the device still operate s correctly \nwith a positive full -scale voltage, which  is 5% beyond the nominal.  \nThe range of input span in both the unipolar and bipolar modes has a minimum value of 0.8 ×  V\nREF/gain and a maximum value \nof 2.1 ×  VREF/gain. However, the span , which is the difference \nbetween th e bottom of the AD7124- 8 input range and the top of \nits input range , must  account for the limitation on the positive \nfull-scale voltage. The amount of offset that can be accommodated  \ndepends o n whether the unipolar or bipolar mode is being used. \nThe offset must  account for the limitation on the positive full -\nscale voltage. In unipolar mode, there is considerable flexibility in \nhandling negative (with respect to AIN M) offsets. In both \nunipolar a nd bipolar modes, the range of positive offsets that \ncan be handled by the device  depends on the selected span. \nTherefore, in determining the limits for system zero -scale and \nfull-scale calibrations, the user must  ensure that the offset range \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 54 of 94 plus the span  range does exceed 1.05 ×  VREF/gain. This is best \nillustrated by looking at a few examples.  \nIf the device  is used in unipolar mode with a required span of  \n0.8 × VREF/gain, the offset range that the system calibration can  \nhandle is from −1.05 × VREF/gain to  +0.25 × VREF/gain. If  the \ndevice  is used in unipolar mode with a required span of \nVREF/gain, the offset range that the system calibration can \nhandle is from − 1.05 × VREF/gain to +0.05 ×  VREF/gain. Similarly, \nif the device  is used in unipolar mode and requ ired to remove \nan offset of 0.2 × VREF/gain, the span range that the system \ncalibration can handle is 0.85 ×  VREF/gain.  \nIf the device  is used in bipolar mode with a required span of  \n±0.4 × VREF/gain, then the offset range that  the system \ncalibration can han dle is from − 0.65 × VREF/gain to +0.65 × \nVREF/gain. If the device is used in bipolar mode with a required \nspan of ± VREF/gain, the offset range the system calibration can \nhandle is from −0.05 × VREF/gain to +0.05 × VREF/gain. \nSimilarly, if the device is used in bipolar  mode and required to \nremove an offset of ± 0.2 × VREF/gain, the span range that the \nsystem calibration can handle is ± 0.85 × VREF/gain.  \nSYSTEM SYNCHRONI ZATION  \nThe SYNC  input allows the user to reset the modulator and the \ndigital filt er without affecting any of the setup conditions on the \ndevice . This allows the user to start gathering samples of the \nanalog input from a known point in time, that is, the rising edge \nof SYNC . Take SYNC  low fo r at least four master clock cycles to \nimplement the synchronization function.  \nIf multiple AD7124- 8 devices are operated from a common \nmaster clock, they can be synchronized so that their dat a \nregisters are updated simultaneously. A falling edge on the \nSYNC  pin resets the digital filter and the analog modulator and \nplaces the AD7124- 8 into a consistent, known state. While the SYNC  pin is low, the AD7124- 8 is maintained in this state. On \nthe SYNC  rising edge, the modulator and filter e xit this reset \nstate and, on the next clock edge, the device  starts to gather \ninput samples again. In a system using multiple AD7124 -8 \ndevices, a common signal to their SYNC  pins synchro nizes their \noperation. This is normally performed  after each AD7124- 8 has \nperformed its own calibration or has calibration coefficients \nloaded into its calibration registers. The conversions f rom the \nAD7124- 8 devices are then synchronized.  \nThe device  exits  reset on the master clock falling edge following \nthe SYNC  low to high transition. Therefore, when multip le \ndevices are being synchronized, pull the SYNC  pin high on the \nmaster clock rising edge to ensure that all devices begin \nsampling on the master clock falling edge. If the SYNC  pin is \nnot taken high in sufficient time, it is possible to have a \ndifference of one master clock cycle between the devices; that is, the instant at which conversions are available differs from device  to device  by a maximum of one master clock cycle.  \nThe \nSYNC  pin c an also be used as a start conversion command. \nIn this mode, the rising edge of SYNC  starts conversion and the \nfalling edge of RDY  indicates when the conversion is complete. \nThe settling time of the filter must  be allowed for each data \nregister update. For example, if the ADC is configured to use the sinc\n4 filter and zero latency is disabled, the settling time \nequals 4/f ADC where f ADC is the output data rate when \ncontinuously converting on a single channel.  \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD7124-8\n \nRev.

The following sections describe each filter type, indicating the available output data rates for each filter option. The filter response along with the settling time and 50 Hz and \n60 Hz rejection is also discussed. \nThe filter bits in the filter register select between the sinc type filter.  \nSINC4 FILTER \nWhen the AD7124-8  is powered up, the sinc4 filter is selected by \ndefault. This filter gives excellent noise performance over the complete range of output data rates. It also gives the best 50 Hz/ \n60 Hz rejection, but it has a long settling time.

E | Page 56 of 94 Sinc4 Zero Latency  \nZero latency is enabled by setting the SINGLE_CYCLE bit in \nthe filter  register to 1. With zero latency, the conversion time \nwhen continuously converting on a single channel approximatel y \nequals the sett ling time. The benefit of this mode is that a simila r \nperiod of time elapses between all conversions irrespective of whether the conversions occur on one channel or whether several channels are used. When the analog input is continuously  sampled \non a singl e channel, the output data rate equals  \nf\nADC = f CLK/(4 × 32 × FS[10:0])  \nwhere:  \nfADC is the output data rate . \nfCLK is the master clock  frequency . \nFS[10:0] is the decimal equivalent of the FS [10:0]  bits in the \nsetup filter register.  \nWhen the user selects anot her channel , there is an extra delay in \nthe first conversion of  \nDead  Time/fCLK  \nwhere  Dead  Time = 61 when FS[10:0] = 1 and 9 5 when \nFS[10:0]  > 1.  \nAt low output data rates, this extra delay has little impact on the value  of the settling time. However, at h igh output data rates, the \ndelay must  be considered. Table 57 summarizes the output data  \nrate when continuously converting on a single channel and the settling time when switching between  channels for a sample of \nFS[10:0] values.  \nWhen switching between channels, the AD7124- 8 allows the \ncomplete settling time to generate the first conversion after the channel change. Therefore, the ADC automatically operates in zero latency mode when several channels are enabled —setting \nthe SINGLE_CYCLE bit has no benefits.  \nTable 57.

Sinc3 Channel Change  \nWhen conversions are performed on a single channel and a step \nchange occurs, the ADC does not detect the change in the analog input. Therefore, it continues to output conversions at \nthe programmed output data rate. However, it is at least three \nconversions later before the output data accurately reflects the analog input. If the step change occurs while the ADC is processing a conversion, the ADC takes four conversions after the step \nchange to generate a fully settled result. \n1/fADCANALOG\nINPUT\nADC\nOUTPUTFULLY\nSETTLED\n13048-101 \nFigure 94. Asynchronous Step Change in the Analog Input \nSinc3 Zero Latency \nZero latency is enabled by setting the SINGLE_CYCLE bit in \nthe filter register to 1. With zero latency, the conversion time \nwhen continuously converting on a single channel approximately equals the settling time. The benefit of this mode is that a similar period of time elapses between all conversions irrespective of \nwhether the conversions occur on one channel or whether \nseveral channels are used.  \n When the analog input is continuously sampled on a single \nchannel, the output data rate equals \nf\nADC = fCLK/(3 × 32 × FS[10:0] ) \nwhere: \nfADC is the output data rate. \nfCLK is the master clock frequency. \nFS[10:0]  is the decimal equivalent of the FS[10:0] bits in the \nfilter register. \nWhen switching channels, there is an extra delay in the first \nconversion of  \nDead Time /fCLK  \nwhere Dead Time  = 61 when FS[10:0] = 1 or 95 when FS[10:0] > 1.  \nAt low output data rates, this extra delay has little impact on the \nvalue of the settling time. However, at high output data rates, the delay must be considered. Table 59 summarizes the output data rate \nwhen continuously converting on a single channel and the settling \ntime when switching between channels for a sample of FS[10:0].  \nWhen the user selects another channel, the AD7124-8  allows \nthe complete settling time to generate the first conversion after the channel change. Therefore, the ADC automatically operates in zero latency mode when several channels are enabled—setting \nthe SINGLE_CYCLE bit has no benefits. \nWhen the analog input is constant or a channel change occurs, \nvalid conversions are available at a near constant output data \nrate. When conversions are being performed on a single channel \nand a step change occurs on the analog input, the ADC continues to output fully settled conversions if the step change is synchronized with the conversion process. If the step change is asynchronous, one conversion is output from the ADC that is not completely settled (see Figure 95). \nANALO G\nINPUT\nADC\nOUTPUTFULLY\nSETTLED\n1/fADC\n13048-102 \nFigure 95.

E | Page 66 of 94 SUMMARY OF FILTER OP TIONS  \nThe AD7124 -8 has several filter options.

E | Page 67 of 94 DIAGNOSTICS \nThe AD7124 -8 has numerous diagnostic functions on chip. Use \nthese features t o ensure  \n• Read/write operations are to valid registers only  \n• Only valid data is written to the on -chip registers  \n• Appropriate de coupling is used on the LDOs  \n• The external reference, if used, is present  \n• The ADC modulator  and filter a re working within \nspecification  \nSIGNAL  CHAIN  CHECK  \nFunctions such as the reference and power supply voltages can \nbe selected as inputs to the ADC. Th e AD7124 -8 can therefore \ncheck the voltages connected to the device. The AD7124 -8 also \ngenerates an internal 20 mV signal that can b e applied internally to \na channel  by selecting the V_20MV _P to V_20 MV_M channel \nin the channel register. The PGA can be checked using this \nfunction. As the PGA setting is increased, for example, the signal as a percent of the analog input range is reduced by a \nfactor of two. This allows the user to check that the PGA is \nfunctioning correctly.  \nREFERENCE DETECT  \nThe AD7124 -8 includes on -chip circuitry to detect if there is a \nvalid reference for co nversions or calibrations when the user \nselects an external reference as the reference source. This is a valuable feature in applications such as RTDs or strain gages \nwhere the reference is derived externally.  \n0.7VCOM PARATOR\nREFIN (REFINx(+) – REFINx(–))OUTPU T: 0 WHEN REFIN ≤0.7\n                 1 WHEN REFIN <0.7\n13048-128 \nFigure 121 . Referen ce Detect Circuitry  \nThis feature is enabled when the REF_DET_ERR_EN bit in the \nERROR _EN register is set to 1. If the voltage between the \nselected REFIN x(+) and REFIN x(−) pins goes below 0.7  V,  o r  \neither the REFIN x(+) or REFIN x(−) inputs are open circuit, t he \nAD7124- 8 detects that it no longer ha s a valid reference. In this \ncase, the REF_DET_ERR bit in the e rror register is set to 1 . The \nERR bit in the status register is also set.  \nIf the AD7124- 8 is performing normal conversions and the \nREF_DET_ERR bit becomes active, the conversion results revert to all 1s. Therefore, it is not necessary to continuously monitor the status of the RE F_DET_ERR bit when performing \nconversions. It is only necessary to verify its status if the conversion result read from the ADC data register is all 1 s.  \nIf the AD7124- 8 is performing either o ffset or full -scale \ncalibrations and the REF_DET_ERR bit becomes active, the \nupdating of the respective calibration register is inhibited to \navoid loading incorrect coefficients to the register, and the REF_DET_ERR bit is set. If the user is concerned abou t \nverifying that a valid reference is in place every time a calibration  is performed, check the status of the REF_DET_ERR bit at the \nend of the calibration cycle.  \nThe reference detect flag may be  set when the device exits  of \nstandby mode. Therefore, read the e rror register after exiting \nstandby mode to reset the  flag to 0.  \nCALIBRATION, CONVERS ION , AND SATURATION \nERRORS  \nThe conversion process and calibration process can also be \nmonitored by the AD7124- 8. These diagnostics check the \nanalog input used as well as the modulator and digital filter \nduring conversions or calibration. The functions can be enabled  \nusing the ADC_CAL_ERR_EN, ADC_CONV_ERR_EN , and \nADC_SAT_ERR_EN  bits in the E RROR _EN register . With these \nfunctions enabled, the ADC_  CAL_ERR, ADC_CONV_ERR , and \nADC_SAT_ERR bits are set if an error occurs.  \nThe ADC_CONV_ERR flag is set if there is an overflow or \nunderflow in the digital filter. The ADC conversion clamp s to \nall 0s or all 1s also. Th is flag is updated in conjunction with the \nupdate of the data register and can be cleared only by a read of \nthe error register.  \nThe ADC_SAT_ERR flag is set if the modulator outputs 20 consecutive 1s or 0s. This indicates that the modulator has saturated.  \nWhen an offset calibration is performed, the resulting offset coefficient must be between 0x7FF FF and 0xF80000. If the \ncoefficient is outside this range, the offset register is not updated \nand the ADC_CAL_ERR flag is set. During a full -scale calibration , \noverflow of the digital filter is checked. If an overflow occurs, \nthe error flag is set and the gain  register is not updated.  \nOVERVOLTAGE/UNDERVOLTAGE DETECTION  \nThe overvoltage/undervoltage monitors check the absolute \nvoltage on the AINx analog input pins . The absolute voltage \nmust be within specification to meet the datasheet \nspecifications. If the ADC is operated outside the datasheet limits, linearity degrade s.  \nAINxOVE RVOLTAGE\nCOM PARATOR\nAVDD + 40mVAINx_OV_ERR: SET IF AINx IS\n40mV ABOVE AVDD\nAINx_UV_ERR: SET IF AINx IS\n40mV ABOVE AVSSUNDE RVOLTAGE\nCOM PARATOR\nNOTE: AINx IS AINP ORAINMAVSS – 40mV\n13048-129 \nFigure 122 . Analog Input Overvoltage/Undervoltage Monitors  \n \n \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 68 of 94 The positive (AINP) and negative (AINM) analog inputs can be \nseparately checked for overvoltages and undervoltages. The \nAINP_OV_ERR_EN and AINP_UV_ERR_EN bits in the \nERROR _EN register enable the overvoltage/undervoltage \ndiagnostics respectively. An overvoltage i s flagged when the \nvoltage on AINP  exceeds AV DD while an undervoltage is flagged \nwhen the voltage on AINP goes below AV SS. Similarly, an \novervoltage/undervoltage check on the negative analog input pin is enabled using the AINM_OV_ERR_EN and AINM_UV_  \nERR_EN  bits in the E RROR_ EN register. The error flags are \nAINP_OV_ERR, AINP_UV_ERR, AINM_OV_ERR , and \nAINM_UV_ERR in the error register.  \nWhen this function is enabled, the corresponding flags may be  \nset in the e rror register. Therefore , the user must  read the e rror \nregister when the overvoltage/undervoltage checks are enabled to ensure that the flags are reset to 0.   \nPOWER SUPPLY MONITOR S \nAlong with converting external voltages, the ADC can monitor \nthe voltage on the AV DD pin and the IOV DD pin. When the \ninput s of AV DD to AV SS or IOV DD to DGND are selected, the \nvoltage ( AV DD to AV SS or IOV DD to DGND) is internally \nattenuated by  6, and the resulting voltage is applied to the Σ -Δ \nmodulator. This is useful because variations in the power supply \nvoltage can be monitored . \nLDO MONITORING  \nThere are several LDO checks included on the AD7124- 8. Like \nthe external power supplies, the voltage generated by the analog and digital LDOs are selectable as inputs to the A DC. In addition, \nthe AD7124- 8 can continuously monitor the LDO voltages.  \nPower Supply Monitor  \nThe voltage generated by the A LDO and D LDO can be \nmonitored by enabling the A LDO_PSM_ERR_EN bit a nd the \nDLDO_PSM_ERR_EN bit , respectively , in the ERROR_EN \nregister. When enabled, the output voltage of the LDO is \ncontinuously monitored. If the ALDO voltage drops below \n1.6 V , the ALDO_PSM_ERR flag is asserted. If the DLDO \nvoltage drops below 1.55 V , the  DLDO_PSM_ERR flag is \nasserted. The bit remains set until the corresponding LDO voltage recovers. However, the bit is only cleared when the error  register is read.  \n1.6VOVE RVOLTAGE\nCOM PARATOR\nALDO\nSET IF ALDO OUTPUT VO LTAGE IS\nLESS THAN 1.6V\n13048-130 \nFigure 123 .

Digital LDO Monitor The AD7124 -8 can also test the circuitry used for the power \nsupply monitoring. When the ALDO_PSM_TRIP_TEST_EN or \nDLDO_PSM_TRIP_TEST_EN bits are set, the input to the test circuitry is tied to GND rather than the LDO output. Set t he \ncorresponding ALDO_PSM_ERR or DLDO_PSM_ERR bit.  \nLDO Capacitor Detect  \nThe analog and digital LDOs require an external decoupling capacitor of 0.1 µ F. T he  AD7124- 8 can check for the presence of \nthis decoupling capacitor. Using the LDO_CAP_CHK bits in the ERROR_EN register, the LDO being checked is turned off and the voltage at the LDO output is monitored. If the voltage falls, thi s is considered a fail and the LDO_CAP_ERR bit in the \nerror register is set.  \nOnly the analog LDO or digital LDO can be tested for the presence of the decoupling capacitor at any one time. This test \nalso interferes with the conversion process.  \nThe circuit ry used to check for missing decoupling capacitors \ncan also be tested by the AD7124- 8. When the LDO_CAP_  \nCHK_TEST_EN bit in the E RROR_E N register is set, the \ndecoupling capacitor is internally  disconnected from the LDO, \nforcing a fault condition. Therefore, when the LDO capacitor \ntest is performed, a fault condition is reported , that is,  the \nLDO_CAP_ERR bit in the error register is  set. \nMCLK COUNTER  \nA stable master clock is important as the out put data rate, filter \nsettling time , and the filter notch frequencies are dependent on \nthe master clock. The AD7124- 8 allows the user to monitor the \nmaster clock. When the MCLK_CNT_EN bit in the ERROR _EN \nregister is set, the MCLK_C OUNT  register increment s by 1 every  \n131 master clock cycles. The user can monitor this register over a fixed period of time. The master clock frequency can be determined f rom the re sult in the MCLK_COUNT register . \nThe MCLK_COUNT  register wraps around after  it reaches its \nmaximum value.  \nNote that the incrementation of the register is asynchronous to the register read. If a register read coincides with the register \nincrementation, it is possible to read an invalid value.  T o prevent  \nthis, read the register four times rather than once, then read the \nregister four times again at a later point.  By reading four values, \nit is possible to identify the correct register value at the start and at the  end of the timing instants.  \nSPI SCLK COUNTER  \nThe SPI SCLK counter counts the number of SCLK pulses used in each read and write operation. \nCS must frame every read and \nwrite operation when this function is used. All read and write operations are multiple s of eight SCLK pulses (8, 16, 32, 40, 48). \nIf the SCLK counter counts the SCLK pulses and the result is not a \nmultiple of eight , an error is flagged ; the SPI_SCLK_CNT_ERR b it \nin the error register is set. If a write operation is being performed  \nand the SCLK contains  an incorrect number of SCLK pulses, \nthe value is not written to the addressed register  and the write \noperation is aborted.  \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev. E | Page 69 of 94 The SCLK counter is enabled by setting the  SPI_SCLK_  \nCNT_ERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN  register.  \nSPI READ/WRITE ERRORS  \nAlong with the SCLK counter, the AD7124 -8 can also check the \nread and write operations to ensure that valid registers are being \naddressed. When the SPI_READ_ERR_EN  bit or the SPI_  \nWRITE_ERR_EN bit in the ERR OR_EN  register  are set, the \nAD7124- 8 checks the address of the read/write operations. If \nthe user attempts to write to or read from any register other \nthan the user registers described in this  data  sheet, an error is \nflagged ; the SPI_READ_ERR  bit or the SPI_WRITE_ERR bit in \nthe error register is set and the read/write operation is aborted.  \nThis function , along with the SCLK counter and the CRC , \nmakes the serial interface more robust. Invalid r egisters are not \nwritten to or read from. An incorrect number of SCLK pulses \ncan cause the serial interface to go asynchronous and incorrect registers to be accessed. The AD7124- 8 protects aga inst these \nissues via the diagnostics.  \nSPI_I GNORE  ERROR  \nAt certain times, the on -chip registers are not accessible. For \nexample, during power -up, the on -chip registers are set to their \ndefault values. The user must wait until this operation is complete before writing to registers. Also, when offset or gain calibrations are being performed, registers cannot be accessed. The SPI_IGNORE_ERR bit in the error register indicates when the on -chip registers cannot be written to. This diagnostic is \nenabled by defau lt. The function can be disabled using the \nSPI_IGNORE_ERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register.  \nAny write operations performed when SPI_IGNORE_ERR is \nenabled are ignored.  \nCHECKSUM PROTECTION  \nThe AD7124 -8 has a checksum mode  that can be used to improve \ninterface robustness. Using the checksum ensures that only \nvalid data is written to a register and allows data read from a register to be validated. If an error occurs during a register write, the CR C_ERR bit is set in the error register. However, to \nensure that the register write was successful, read back the \nregister and verify the checksum.  \nFor CRC checksum calculations, the following polynomial is \nalways used:  \nx\n8 + x2 + x + 1 \nThe CRC_ERR_EN bit i n the ERROR_EN  register enables and \ndisables the checksum.  \nThe checksum is appended to the end of each read and write transaction. The checksum calculation for the write transaction \nis calculated using the 8 -bit command word and the 8 -bit to 24 -bit \ndata. F or a read transaction, the checksum is calculated using the \ncommand word and the 8 -bit to 32 -bit data output. Figure 125  and \nFigure 126  show SPI write and read transactions , respectively.  8-BIT COMMAND 8-BIT CRC UPTO 24-BIT INPUT\nCS DATA CRCCS\nDIN\nSCLK\n13048-132 \nFigure 125 .

SPI Read Transaction with CRC  \nIf checksum protection is enabled when continuous read mode \nis active, there is an implied read data command of 0x42 before every data transmission that must  be accounted for when \ncalculating the checksum value. This ensures a nonzero checksum  \nvalue even if the ADC data equals 0 x000000.  \nMEMORY MAP CHECKSUM PROTECTION  \nFor added robustness, a CRC calculati on is performed on the \non-chip registers as well. The status register, data register , error \nregister , and MCLK counter register are not included in this \ncheck because  their contents change continuously. The CRC is \nperformed at a rate of 1/2400 seconds. Eac h time that the \nmemory  map is accessed, the CRC is re calculated. Even ts that \ncause the CRC to be recalculated are  \n• A user write  \n• An offset/full -scale calibration  \n• When the device is operated in single conversion mode and the ADC goes into standby  mode followi ng the \ncompletion of the conversion  \n• When exiting continuous read mode (the CONT_READ bit in the ADC_C ONTROL  register is set to 0 ) \nThe memory map CRC function is enabled by setting the MM_  \nCRC_ERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register to 1. If  an error \noccurs, th e MM_CRC_ERR  bit in the error register is set to 1 .  \n \n \n \n \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 70 of 94 ROM CHECKSUM PROTECT ION  \nOn power -up, all registers are set to default values. These \ndefault values are held in read only memory ( ROM ). For added \nrobustness, a CRC calculation is performed on the ROM  contents \nas well. The CRC is performed on power -up.  \nThe ROM CRC function is enabled by setting the ROM_CRC_  \nERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register to 1 . If an error occurs, \nthe ROM_CRC_ERR bit in the error register is set to 1 . \nWhen this function is enabled,  the internal master clock, if \nenabled, remains active in the standby mode.  \n CRC Calculation  \nThe checksum, which is 8  bits wide, is generated using the \npolynomial  \nx8 + x2 + x + 1 \nTo generate the checksum, the data is left shifted by eight bits to \ncreate a  number ending in eight Logic 0s. The polynomial is \naligned so that  its MSB is adjacent to the leftmost Logic 1 of the \ndata. An XOR (exclusive OR) function is applied to the data to produce a new, shorter number. The polynomial is again aligned \nso that its  MSB is adjacent to the leftmost Logic 1 of the new result, \nand the procedure is repeated.

E | Page 71 of 94 BURNOUT CURRENTS  \nThe AD7124 -8 contains two constant current generators that  \ncan be programmed to 0.5 µ A, 2 µ A, or 4 µA. One generator \nsources current from AV DD to AIN P, and one sinks  current from \nAINM to AV SS. These currents enable open wire detection.  \nX-MUXAVDD\nAVSSBURNOUT\nDETECTPGA1\n13048-134 \nFigure 127 . Burnout Currents  \nThe currents are switched to the selected analog input pair. \nBoth currents are either on or off. The burnout  bits in the \nconfiguration register enable/disable the burnout currents alon g \nwith setting the amplitude. Use t hese currents to verify that an \nexternal transducer is still operational before attempting to take \nmeasurements on that channel. After  the burnout currents are \nturned on, they flow in the external transducer circuit, and a \nmeasurement of the input voltage on the analog input channel can be taken. If the resulting voltage measured is near full scale, \nthe user must  verify why this is the case. A near full -scale readin g \ncan mean that the front -end sensor is open circuit. It c an also \nmean that the front -end sensor is overloaded and is justified in \noutputting full scale, or that the reference may be absent and the \nREF_DET_ERR bit is set, thus clamping the data to all 1 s. When a conversion is close to full scale, the user must  check \nthese three cases before making a judgment. If the voltage measured is 0 V , it may indicate that the transducer has short \ncircuited. For normal operation, these burnout currents are \nturned off by setting the burnout  bits to zero. The current \nsources wo rk over the normal absolute input voltage range \nspecifications with buffers on.  \nTEMPERATURE SENSOR  \nEmbedded in the AD7124- 8 is a temperature sensor that  is \nuseful to monitor the die temperatur e. This is selected using the \nAINP [4:0]  and AINM [4:0]  bits in the channel register. The \nsensitivity is 13 ,584 codes/°C, approximately.

E | Page 72 of 94 GROUNDING AND LAYOUT  \nThe analog inputs and reference inputs are differential and, \ntherefore, most of the voltages in the analog m odulator are \ncommon -mode  voltages. The high common -mode rejection of \nthe device  removes common -mode noise on these inputs. The \nanalog and digital supplies to the AD7124- 8 are independent \nand s eparately pinned out to minimize coupling between the \nanalog and digital sections of the device. The digital filter \nprovides rejection of broadband noise on the power supplies, except at integer multiples of the master clock frequency.  \nThe digital filter also removes noise from the analog and reference inputs, provided that these noise sources do not saturate the analog modulator. As a result, the AD7124- 8 is \nmore immune to noise interference than a conventional high resolution converter. However, because the resolution of the \nAD7124- 8 is high and the noise levels from the converter are so \nlow, care must be taken with regard to gro unding and layout.  \nThe PCB that houses the ADC must be designed so that the \nanalog and digital sections are separated and confined to \ncertain areas of the board. A minimum etch technique is generally best for ground planes because it results in the best shielding.  \nIn any layout, the user must keep in mind the flow of currents \nin the system, ensuring that the paths for all return currents are as close  as possible to the p aths the currents took to reach their \ndestinations . \nAvoid running digital lines under th e device because this \ncouples noise onto the die and allows the analog ground plane to run under the AD7124- 8 to prevent noise coupling. The \npower supply lines to the AD7124- 8 must use as wide a trace as possible to provide low impedance paths and reduce glitches on \nthe power supply line. Shield fast switching signals like clocks \nwith digital ground to prevent radiating noise to other sections of the board and never run clock signals near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Run traces on opposite sides of the board at right angles to each other. This reduces the effects of feedthrough on the board. A mi crostrip \ntechnique is by far the best but is not always possible with a double -sided board. In this technique, the component side of \nthe board is dedicated to ground planes, whereas signals are placed on the solder side.  \nGood decoupling is important when using high resolution ADCs.  \nThe AD7124 -8 has two power supply pins —AV\nDD and IOV DD. \nThe AV DD pin is referenced to AV SS, and the IOV DD pin is \nreferenced to DGND. Decouple AV DD with a 1 µF tantalu m \ncapacitor in parallel with a 0.1 µF capacitor to AV SS on each pin. \nPlace t he 0.1  µF capacitor as close as possible to the device on \neach supply, ideally right up against the device. Decouple IOV DD \nwith a 1 µF tantalum capacitor in parallel with a 0.1 µF \ncapacitor to DGND. All analog inputs must  be decoupled to \nAV SS. If an external reference is used, decouple the REF INx( +) \nand REF INx( −) pins to AV SS. \nThe AD7124 -8 also has two on -board LDO regulators —one \nthat regulates the AV DD supply and one that regulates the IOV DD \nsupply. For the REGCAPA pin, it is recommended that a  0.1 µF \ncapacitor to AV SS be used. Similarly, for the REGCAPD pin, it is \nrecommended that a 0.1  µF capacitor to DGND be used.  \nIf using the AD7124 -8 with split supply operation, a separate \nplane m ust be used for AV SS. \n \n \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev. E | Page 73 of 94 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nThe AD7124 -8 offers a low cost, high resolution analog -to-\ndigital function. Because the analog -to-digital function is provided  \nby a Σ -Δ architecture,  the device  is more immune to noisy \nenvironments, making it ideal for use in sensor measurement, \nand industrial and process control applications.  \nTEMPERATURE MEASUREM ENT USING A \nTHERMOCOUPLE  \nFigure  129 outlines a connection from a thermocouple to the \nAD7124 -8. In a thermocouple application, the voltage generated  \nby the thermocouple is measured with respect to an absolute \nreference ; thus, the internal reference is used for this conversion.  \nThe cold junction measurement uses a ratiometric configuration , \nso the reference is provided externally.  \nBecause the signal from the thermocouple is small, the AD7124 -8 \nis operated with the PGA enabled to amplify the signal from the \nthermocouple. As the input channel is buffered, large decoupling \ncapacitors can be placed on the front end to eliminate any noise \npickup that may be present in the thermocouple leads. The bias voltage generator provides a common -mode voltage so that the \nvoltage generated by the thermocouple is biased up to ( AV\nDD − \nAV SS)/2. For thermocouple voltages that are centered about ground , \nthe AD7124 -8 can be operated with a split power supply ( ±1.8 V).  \nThe cold junction compensati on is performed using a thermi stor in \nFigure 129. The on -chip excitation current supplies the thermistor. \nIn addition, the reference voltage for the cold junction measurement  \nis derived from a precision resistor in series with the thermistor. \nThis allows a ratiometric measurement so that variation of the \nexcitation current has no effect on the measurement (it is the \nratio of the precision reference resistance to the thermistor resistance that is measured).  Most conversions are  read from the ther mocouple, with the \ncold junction being read only periodically as the cold junction temperature is stable or slow moving. If a T -type thermocouple \nis used, it can measure a temperature from −200°C to +400°C. The voltage generated over this temperature range is −8.6 mV \nto +17.2 mV . The AD7124 -8 internal reference e quals 2.5 V . \nTherefore, the PGA is  set to 128. If the thermocouple uses the \nAIN0/ AIN1 channel  and the thermistor is connected to the \nAIN12/ AIN13 channel , the conversion process is as follows:  \n1. Reset the ADC . \n2. Select the power mode . \nSet the CHANNEL_ 0 register  analog input to AIN0/ AIN1. \nAssign Setup 0 to this channel. Configure Setup 0 to have a \ngain of  128 and select the internal reference.  Select the \nfilter type and set the output data rate.  \n3. Enable V BIAS  on AIN0 . \n4. Set the CHANNEL_ 1 register  analog input to AIN12/ AIN13 . \nAssign Setup 1 to this channel. Configure Setup 1 to have a \ngain of 1 and select the e xternal reference REFIN2 (±). Select  \nthe filter type and set the output data rate.  \n5. Enable  the excitation current ( IOUTx ) and select a suitable \nvalue. Output this current to the  AIN4 pin. \n6. Enable the AIN0/ AIN1 channel . Wait until \nRDY  goes low. \nRead the c onversion .  \n7. Continue to r ead nine  further conversions from the \nAIN0/AIN1 channel . \n8. Disable CHANNEL_ 0 and enable CHANNEL_ 1. \n9. Wait until RDY  goes low. Read one conversion.  \n10. Repeat Step 5 to  Step  8. \nUsing the linearization equati on for the T -type thermocouple , \nprocess the thermocouple voltage along with the thermistor voltage  \nand compute the actual temperature at the thermocouple head.  \nSERIA L\nINTER FACE\nAND\nCONTRO L\nLOGIC\nINTERNA L\nCLOCKCLKAVDDAVDD\nAIN0\nX-MUXAVDDREFERENCE\nDETECT\nDOUT/RD Y\nSCLK\nCS\nIOVDD\nVDDAVSSTEM P\nSENSORDIN\nSYNCPSWREFIN1(–)REFIN1(+)\nRREFAIN1\nAIN12\nAIN13\nREFIN2(+)\nREFIN2(–)PGAΣ-Δ\nADC\nAD7124-8\nAVSS DGNDVBIAS\nDIAGNOSTICSCHANNE L\nSEQUENCERBAND GA P\nREFERENCE\nNOTES\n1.

E | Page 74 of 94 The external anti alias filter is omitted for clarity. However, such \na filter is required to reject any interference at the modulator \nfrequency and multiples of the modulator frequency. In addition , \nsome filtering may be needed for EMI purposes. Both the analo g \ninputs and the reference inputs can be buffered , which allows \nthe user to connect any RC combination to the reference or \nanalog input pins.  \nThe required power mode depends on the performance \nrequired from the system along with the current consumption \nallowance for the system. In a field transmitter, low current consumpt ion is essential. In this application, the low power \nmode or mid power mode is most suitable. In process control applications, power consumption is not a priority. Thus , full \npower mode may be selected. The full power mode offers \nhigher throughput and lowe r noise.  \nThe AD7124 -8 on-chip diagnostics allow the user to check the \ncircuit connections, monitor power supply, reference , and LDO \nvoltages, check all conversions and calibrations for any err ors, as \nwell as monitor any read/write operations. In thermocouple \napplications, the circuit connections are verified using the \nreference detect and the burnout currents. The REF_DET_ERR \nflag is set if the external reference REFIN2 (±) is missing. The \nburno ut current s (available in the c onfiguration registers) detect an \nopen wire. For example, if the thermocouple is not connected \nand the burnout currents are enabled on the channel, the ADC outputs a conversion that is equal to or close to full  scale. For \nbest performance, enable the burnout currents periodically to \ncheck the connections but disable  them as soon as  the connections  \nare verified for they add an error to the conversions. The \ndecoupling capacitors on the LDOs can also be checked.  The \nADC indicate s if the capacitor is not present . \nAs part of the conversion process, the analog input overvoltage/  \nundervoltage monitors are useful for  detect ing any excessive \nvoltages on AIN P and AIN M. The power supply voltages and \nreference voltages are selectable as in puts to the ADC. Thus , the \nuser can periodically check these voltages to confirm whether \nthey are within the system specification. Also, the user can check \nthat the LDO voltages are within specification. The conversion process and calibration proc ess can a lso be checked. This e nsures  \nthat any invalid conversions or calibrations are flagged to the user.  \nFinally, the CRC check, SCLK counter, and the SPI read/write \nchecks make the interface more robust as any read/write operation that is not valid is detected.  The CRC check \nhighlights if any bits are corrupted when being transmitted between the processor and the ADC.  \n \n \n \n TEMPERATURE MEASUREM ENT USING AN RTD  \nTo optimize a 3 -wire RTD configuration, two identically \nmatched current sources are required. The AD7124 -8, which \ncontains two well matched current sources, is ideally suited to \nthese applications. One possible 3 -wire configuration is shown \nin Figure 130. In this 3 -wire configuration, the lead resistances \nresult in errors if only one current (output at AIN0) is used, as the excitation current flows through RL1, developing a voltage error between AIN1 and AIN2. In the scheme outlined, the second RTD curren t source (available at AIN3) compensates for \nthe error introduced by the excitation current flowing through RL1. The second RTD current flows through RL2. Assuming that RL1 and RL2 are equal (the leads are  normally of the same \nmaterial and of equal length)  and that the excitation currents \nmatch, the error voltage across RL2 equals the error voltage across RL1, and no error voltage is developed between AIN1 \nand AIN2. Twice the voltage is developed across RL3; however, \nbecause this is a common -mode voltage it  does not introduce \nerrors. The reference voltage for the AD7124- 8 is also generated \nusing one of the  matched current sources. It is developed using \na precision resistor and applied to the dif ferential reference pins \nof the ADC. This scheme ensures that the analog input voltage span remains ratiometric to the reference voltage. Any errors in the analog input voltage due to the temperature drift of the \nexcitation current are compensated by the variation of the reference voltage.   \nAs an example, the PT100 measures temperature from −200°C to +600°C. The resistance is 100 Ω typically at 0°C and 313.71 Ω \nat 600°C. If the 500 µA excitation currents are used, the maximum voltage g enerated across the RT D when using the full \ntemperature range of the RTD is  \n500 µA × 313.71 Ω = 156.86 mV  \nThis is amplified to 2.51 V within the AD7124- 8 if the gain is \nprogrammed to 16.  \nThe voltage generated ac ross the reference resistor must be at least \n2.51 V . Therefore, the reference resistor value must equal at least  \n2.51 V/500 µ A = 5020 Ω  \nTherefore, a 5.11 kΩ resistor  can be used.  \n5.11 kΩ × Excitation Current  = 5.11 kΩ × 500 µA = 2.555 V  \nOne other considera tion is the output compliance. The output \ncompliance equals AV\nDD − 0.37 V.  I f  a  3 .3 V analog supply is \nused, the volt age at AIN0 must be less than (3.3  V − 0.37 V) = \n2.93 V . From the previous calculations, this specification is met \nbecause  the maximum volt age at AIN0  equals the voltage across \nthe reference resistor  plus the voltage across the RTD , which equals  \n2.555 V + 156.86 mV = 2. 712 V  \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev. E | Page 75 of 94 A typical procedure  for reading the RTD is  as follows:  \n1. Reset the ADC . \n2. Select the power mode . \n3. Set the CHANNEL_ 0 register  analog input to AIN1/ AIN2. \nAssign Setup 0 to this channel. Configure Setup 0 to have a \ngain of  16 and select the r eference source REFIN2(±) . \nSelect the filter type and set the output data rate.  \n4. Program the excitation currents to 50 0 µA and output the  \ncurrents on the AIN0 and AIN3 pins.  \n5. Wait until RDY  goes low. Read the conversion  value . \n6. Repeat Step 4. \nIn the processor,  implement the linearization rout ine for the \nPT100 .  \nThe external an tialias filter is omitted for clarity. However, such \na filter is required to reject any interference at the modulator \nfrequency and multiples of the modulator frequency. Also, some \nfiltering may be needed for EMI purposes. Both the analog inputs  \nand reference inputs can be buffered , which allows the use r to \nconnect any RC combination to the reference or analog input pins.  \nOn the AD7124- 8, the excitation currents can be made available \nat the input pins, for example, the AIN 3 pin can function as an \nanalog input as well as outputting the current source. This option \nallows multiple sensors to be connected to the ADC using a minimum pin count. Ho wever, the resistor of the anti aliasing \nfilter is in series with the RTD. This introduces an error in t he \nconversions as there is a vo ltage generated across the anti aliasing \nresistor. To minimize the error, minimize the resistance of the \nantialiasing filter. The power mode to use depends on the performance required \nfrom the system along with the current co nsumption allowance \nfor the system. In a field transmitter, low current consumption \nis essential. In this application, the low power mode or mid power mode is most suitable. In process control applications, power consumption is not a priority. Thus, full p ower mode may be \nselected. The full power mode offers higher throughput and \nlower noise.  \nThe AD7124 -8 on-chip diagnostics allow the user to check the \ncircuit connections, monitor the power sup ply, reference, and \nLDO voltages, check all conversions and calibrations for any \nerrors, as well as monitor any read/write operations. In RTD \napplications, the circuit connections are verified using the reference detect and the burnout currents. The REF_DE T_ERR \nflag is set if the external reference REFIN2(±) is missing. The burnout currents (available in the configuration registers) detec t an \nopen wire. The decoupling capacitors on the LDOs can also be checked. The ADC indicates if the capacitor is not pres ent. \nAs part of the conversion process, the analog input overvoltage/  \nundervoltage monitors are useful to detect any excessive voltages \non AINP and AINM.

E | Page 76 of 94 FLOWMETER  \nFigure 131 shows the AD7124- 8 being used in a flowmeter \napplication that consists of two pressure transducers, with the \nrate of flow being equal to the pressure difference. The pressure \ntransducers are arranged in a bridge network and give a different ial \noutput voltage between its OUT+ and OUT − terminals. With \nrated full -scale pressure (in this case , 300 mmHg) on the trans -\nducer, the differential output voltage is 3 mV/V of the input voltage (that is, the voltage between the IN + and IN − terminals).  \nAssuming a 3  V excitation voltage, the full -scale output range \nfrom the transducer is 9  mV . The excitation voltage for the \nbridge can directly provide the reference for the ADC, as the reference input range includes the supply voltage.  \nA second advantage of u sing the AD7124- 8 in transducer -based \napplications is that the low -side power switch can be fully utilized  \nin low power applications. The low -side power switch is connected \nin series with the cold side of the bridges. In normal operation, \nthe switch is closed and measurements are taken. In applications \nwhere power is of concern, the AD7124 -8 can be placed in standby \nmode, thus sign ificantly reducing the power consumed in the \napplication. In addition, the low -side power switch can be opened  \nwhile in standby mode, thus avoiding unnecessary power \nconsumption by the front -end transducers. When the device  is \ntaken out of standby mode, an d the low -side power switch is \nclosed, the user must  ensure that the front -end circuitry is fully \nsettled before attempting a read from the AD7124 -8. The power \nswitch can be closed prior to ta king the device  out of standby, if \nneeded. This allows time for  the sensor to power up and settle \nbefore the ADC powers up and begins sampling the analog input.  \nIn the diagram, temperature compensation is performed using a thermistor. The on -chip excitatio n current supplies the thermistor. \nIn addition, the reference voltage for the temperature measurement is derived from a precision resistor in series with the thermistor. This allows a ratiometric measurement so that variation of the excitation current has no effect on the measurement (it is the \nratio of the precision reference resistance to the thermistor \nresistance that is measured).  \nIf the sensor sensitivity is 3 mV/V and the excitation voltage is 3 V , \nthe maximum output from the sensor is 9 mV . The AD7124 -8 \nPGA can be set to 128 to amplify the sensor signal.  \nThe AD7124 -8 PGA amplifies the signal to  \n9 mV ×  128 = 1.152 V  \nThis val ue does not exceed the reference voltage (3 V).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A typical procedure  for reading the sensors is  as follows:  \n1.

Read the conversion  value . \n9. Repeat  Step 8 until the temperature is to be read (every 10 \nconversions of the pressure sensor readings, for example) . \n10. Disable CHANNEL_ 0 and CHANNEL_ 1. Enable \nCHANNEL_ 2. \n11. Wait until RDY  goes low. Read the conversion.  \n12. Repe at Step 6 to Step 10 . \nIn the processor, the conversion information is converted to \npressure and the flow rate can be calculated. The proc essor \ntypically contains a look up table for each pressure sensor so its \nvariation with temperature can be compensated.  \nThe external anti alias filter is omitted for clarity. However, such \na filter is required to reject any interference at the modulator \nfrequency and multiples of the modulator frequency. Also, \nsome filtering may be needed for EMI purposes. Both the \nanalog in puts and reference inputs can be buffered , which \nallows the user to connect any RC combination to the reference \nor analog input pins.  \nThe power mode to use depends on the performance required from the system along with the current consumption allowance for the system. In a field transmitter, low current consumption \nis essential. In this application, low power mode or mid power \nmode is most suitable. In process control applications, power \nconsumption is not a priority. Thus, full power mode may be \nselected. Full power mode offers higher throughput and lower \nnoise.  \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev. E | Page 77 of 94 The AD7124 -8 on-chip diagnostics allow the user to check the \ncircuit connections, monitor power supply, reference, and LDO \nvoltage s, check all conversions and calibrations for any errors, as \nwell as monitor any read/write operations. The REF_DET_ERR  \nflag is set if the external reference REFIN2(±) or REFIN1( ±) is \nmissing. The decoupling capacitors on the LDOs can also be checked. The ADC indicates if the capacitor is not present . \nAs part of the conversion process, the analog input overvoltage/  \nundervoltage monitors are useful to detect any excessive  voltages \non AINP and AINM. The power supply voltages and reference voltages are selecta ble as inputs to the ADC. Thus, the user can \nperiodically check these voltages to confirm whether they are within the system specification. In addition , the user can check \nthat the LDO voltages are within specification. The conversion process and calibrati on process can also be checked. This  ensures \nthat any invalid conversions or calibrations are flagged to the user.  \nFinally, the CRC check, SCLK counter, and the SPI read/write \nchecks make the interface more robust as any read/write  operation \nthat is not va lid is detected. The CRC check highlights if any bits \nare corrupted when being transmitted be tween the processor and \nthe ADC .  \n \n \nVBIAS\nSERIA L\nINTER FACE\nAND\nCONTRO L\nLOGIC\nINTERNA L\nCLOCKDIAGNOSTICSCHANNE L\nSEQUENCERDIGITAL\nFILTER\nCLKAVDD\nAIN0\nX-MUXAVDDAVDD\nREFERENCE\nDETECT\nDOUT/RD Y\nSCLK\nCS\nIOVDD\nVDDTEM P\nSENSORDIN\nSYNC\nAVSS\nNOTES\n1.

E | Page 79 of 94 COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER  \nRS[5:0] = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0  \nThe communications register is an 8 -bit, write  only register. All \ncommunications to the device  must start with a write operation \nto the communications register. The data written to the  communi -\ncations  register determines whether the next operation is a read \nor write operation, and to which register this operation takes \nplace , the RS [5:0]  bits selecting the register to be accessed .  \nFor read or write operations, after  the subsequent read  or write \noperation to the selected register is complete, the interface returns to where it expects a write operation to the communications register. This is the default state of the interface  \nand, on power -up or after a reset, the ADC is in this default \nstate waiting for a write operation to the communications \nregister.  \nIn situations where the interface sequence is lost, a write \noperation of at least 64 serial clock cycles with DIN high returns \nthe ADC to this default state by resetting the entire device . \nTable 65 outlines the bit designations for the communications \nregister.

Communications Register Bit Descriptions  \nBits  Bit Name   Description  \n7 WEN  Write enable bit. A 0 must be written to this bit so that the write to the communic ations register actually occurs. If \na 1 is the first bit written, the device does not clock on to subsequent bits in the register. It stays at this bit location \nuntil a 0 is written to this bit. As soon as a 0 is written to the WEN  bit, the next seven bits are loaded to the \ncommunications register.  \n6 R/W A 0 in this bit location indicates that the next operation is a write to a specified register. A 1 in this position \nindicates that the next operation is a rea d from the designated register.  \n5:0 RS[5:0]  Register address bits. These address bits select which registers of the ADC are being selected during this serial \ninterface communication. See Table 64. \n \nSTATUS REGIS TER  \nRS[5:0] = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 \nPower -On/Reset = 0x00 \nThe status register is an 8 -bit, read  only register. To access the ADC status register, the user must write to the communications register, \nselect the next operation to be read, and set the register addr ess bits RS[5:0] to 0 . \nTable 66 outlines the bit designations for the status register.

Status Register Bit Descriptions  \nBits  Bit Name  Description  \n7 RDY  Ready bit for  the ADC. This bit is c leared when data is written to the ADC data register. The RDY  bit is set \nautomatically after the ADC data register is  read or a period of time before the data register is updated with a \nnew conversion result to indicate to the user not to read the conversion data. It is also set when the device  is \nplaced in power -down  or standby mode. The end of a conversion is also indicated by the DOUT/ RDY  pin. This \npin can be used as an alternative to the status register for monitoring the ADC for conversion data.  \n6 ERROR_FLAG  ADC error bit. This bit indicates if one of the error bits has been asserted in the error register. This bit is high if \none or more of the error bits in the error  register has been set. This bit is c leared by a read of the error  register.  \n5 0 This bit is set to 0.  \n4  POR_FLAG  Power -on reset flag. This bit indicates when a power -on reset occurs. A power -on reset occurs on power -up, \nwhen the power supply vo ltage goes below a threshold voltage , when a reset is performed , and when coming \nout of power -down mode . The status register must be read to clear the bit.  \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

ADC Control  Register Bit Descriptions  \nBits  Bit Name  Description  \n15:13  0  These bits must be programmed with a Logic 0 for correct operat ion. \n12 DOUT_ RDY _DEL  Controls the SCLK inactive edge to DOUT/ RDY  high time.  When DOUT_ RDY _DEL is cleared, the delay is \n10 ns min imum . When DOUT_ RDY _DEL is set, the  delay is increased to 100 ns min imum . This function is \nuseful when CS is tied low ( the CS_EN bit is set to 0).  \n11 CONT_READ  Continuous read of the data register. When this bit is set to 1 (and the data regis ter is selected), the serial  \ninterface is configured so that the data register can be continuously read; that is, the contents of the data  \nregister are automatically placed on the DOUT pin when the SCLK pulses are applied after the RDY  pin \ngoes low to indicate that a conversion is complete. The communications register does not have to be \nwritten to for subsequent data reads. To enable continuous read, the CONT_READ bit is set.  To disable \ncontinuous read, write a  read data command  whil e the DOUT/ RDY  pin is low. While continuous read is \nenabled, the ADC monitors activity on the DIN line so that it can receive the instruction to disable \ncontinuous read. Additionally, a reset occurs if 64 consecutive 1s occur on DIN ; therefore, hold DIN low \nuntil an instruction is written to the device.  \n10 DATA_STATUS  This bit enables the transmission of the status register contents after each data register read. When \nDATA_STATUS is set, the contents of the status register are trans mitted along with each data register \nread. This function is useful when several channels are selected because the status register identifies the \nchannel to which the data register value corresponds.  \n9 CS_EN  This bit controls the ope ration of the DOUT/ RDY  pin during read operations.  \n  When CS_EN is cleared, the DOUT pin returns to being a RDY  pin within nanoseconds of the SCLK \ninactive edge (the delay is determined by th e DOUT_ RDY _DEL bit).  \n  When set, the DOUT/ RDY  pin continues to output the LSB of the register being read until CS is taken \nhigh. CS must frame all read operations when CS_EN is set.  CS_EN must be set to use the diagnostic \nfunctions SPI_WRITE_ERR, SPI_READ_ERR, and SPI_SCLK_CNT_ERR.  \nData Sheet  AD7124- 8 \n \nRev. E | Page 81 of 94 Bits  Bit Name  Description  \n8 REF_EN  Internal reference voltage enable.  When this bit is set, the internal reference is enabled and available at \nthe REFOUT pin. When  this bit is  cleared, the internal reference is disabled.  \n7:6 POWER_MODE Power Mode Select. These bits select the power mode. The current consumption and output data rate \nranges are dependent on the power mode.  \n  00 = low power.  \n  01 = mid power.  \n  10 = full power.  \n  11 = full power.  \n5:2 Mode  These bits control the mode of operation for ADC. See Table 68. \n1:0  CLK_SEL  These bits select the clock source for the ADC. Either the on -chip 614.4 kHz clock can be used or an \nexternal clock can be used. The ability to use an external clock allows several AD7124 -8 devices to be \nsynchronized. Also, 50 Hz  and 60 Hz re jection is improved when an accurate external clock drives the ADC.  \n  00 = internal 614.4 kHz clock. The internal clock is not available at the CLK pin.  \n  01 = internal 614.4 kHz clock. This clock is available at the CLK pin.  \n  10 = external 614.4 kHz  clock . \n  11 = external clock. The external clock is divided by 4 within the AD7124 -8. \nTable 68. Operating Modes  \nMode \nValue  Description  \n0000  Continuous conversion mod e (default). In continuous conversion mode, the ADC continuously performs conversions and places \nthe result in the data register. RDY  goes low when a conversion is complete. The user can read these conversions by placing the device \nin continuous read mode whereby the conversions are automatically placed on the DOUT line when SCLK pulses are applied. \nAlternatively, the user can instruct the ADC to output the conversion by writing to the communications register. After power -on, \na reset, or a reconfiguration of the ADC, the complete settling time of the filter is required to generate the first valid conversion. \nSubsequent conversions are available at the selected output data rate, which is dependent on filter choice.  \n0001  Single conversion mode. When single conversion mode is selected, the ADC powers up and performs a single conversion on the \nselected channel. The conversion requires the complete settling time of the filter. The conversion result is placed in the da ta \nregister, RDY  goes low, and the ADC returns to standby mode. The conversion remains in the data register and RDY  remains \nactive (low) until the data is read or another conversion is performed.  \n0010  Standby mode.  In standby mode,  all sections of the AD7124 -8 can be powered down except the LDOs. The internal reference, \non-chip oscillator, low -side power switch, and bias voltage generator can be enabled or disabled whil e in standby mode. The \non-chip registers retain their contents in standby mode.  \n Any enabled diagnostics remain active when the ADC is in standby  mode. The diagnostics can be enabled/disabled while in \nstandby mode. However, any diagnostics that require t he master clock (reference detect, undervoltage/overvoltage detection, \nLDO trip tests, memory map CRC, and MCLK counter) must be enabled when the ADC is in continuous conversion mode or idle \nmode; these diagnostics do not function if enabled in standby mod e. \n0011  Power -down mode.  In power -down mode, all the AD7124 -8 circuitry is powered down, including the current sources, power \nswitch, burnout currents, bias voltage generator, and clock circu itry. The LDOs are also powered down. In power -down mode, the \non-chip registers do not retain their contents. Therefore, coming out of power-down mode, all registers must be reprogrammed.  \n0100  Idle mode.  In idle mode, the ADC filter and modulator are held  in a reset state even though the modulator clocks continue to be \nprovided. \n0101  Internal zero -scale (offset) calibration.  An internal short is automatically connected to the input. RDY  goes high when the \ncalibration is initiated an d returns low when the calibration is complete. The ADC is placed in idle mode following a calibration. \nThe measured offset coefficient is placed in the offset register of the selected channel. Select only one channel when zero -scale \ncalibration is being p erformed. An internal zero -scale calibration takes a time of one settling period to be performed.  \n0110  Internal full -scale (gain) calibration. A full -scale input voltage is automatically connected to the selected analog input for this \ncalibration. RDY  goes high when the calibration is initiated and returns low when the calibration is complete. The ADC is placed \nin idle mode following a calibration. The measured full -scale coefficient is placed in the gain register of the selected cha nnel. A \nfull-scale calibration is required each time the gain of a channel is changed to minimize the full -scale error. Select only one \nchannel when full -scale calibration is being performed. The AD7124 -8 is factory calibrated at a gain of 1. F urther internal \nfull-scale calibrations at a gain of 1 are not supported. An internal full -scale calibration (gain > 1) takes a time of four settling \nperiods.  \n Internal full -scale calibrations cannot be performed in the full power mode. So, if using the full -power mode, select mid or low \npower mode for the internal full -scale calibration. This calibration is valid in full power mode as the same reference and gain are \nused. When performing internal zero -scale and internal full -scale calibrations, the internal full -scale calibration must be \nperformed before the internal zero -scale calibration. Therefore, write 0x800000 to the offset register before performing any \ninternal full -scale calibration, which resets  the offset register to its default value.  \nAD7124- 8 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

E | Page 87 of 94 Bits  Bit Name  Description  \n5 SPI_SCLK_CNT_ERR _EN  When this bit is set, the SCLK counter is enabled. All read and write operations to the ADC are \nmultiples of eight bits. For every serial communication, the SCLK counter counts the number of \nSCLK pulses. CS must be used to frame each read and write operation. If the number of SCLK \npulses used during a communication is not a multiple  of eight, the SPI_SCLK_CNT _ERR bit in the \nerror register is set. For example, a glitch on the SCLK pin during  a read or write operation can be \ninterpreted as an SCLK pulse. In this case, the SPI_SCLK_CNT_ERR bit is set as there is an excessive number of SCLK pulses detected.  \nCS_EN in the ADC_ CONTROL register must be set to 1 when the \nSCLK counter function is being used.  \n4 SPI_READ_ERR _EN  When this bit is set, the SPI_READ_ERR bit in the error  register is set when an error occurs during a \nread operation.

An error occurs if the user attempts to write to invalid addresses or write to read -\nonly registers. CS_EN in the ADC_CONTROL register must be set to 1 when the SPI  write check \nfunction is being used.  \n2 SPI_CRC_ERR _EN  This bit enables a CRC check of all read and write operations. The SPI_CRC_ERR bit in the error  \nregister is set if the CRC check fails. In addition, an 8 -bit CRC word is appended to all data read \nfrom the AD7124 -8.  \n1 MM_CRC_ERR _EN  When this bit is set, a CRC calculation is performed on the memory map each time that the \nregisters are written to. Following this, periodic CRC checks are perf ormed on the on -chip \nregisters. If the register contents have changed, the MM_CRC _ERR bit is set.  \n0 ROM_CRC_ERR _EN  When this bit is set, a  CRC calculation is performed on the ROM contents on power -on.

MCLK_COUNT  Register Bit Descriptions  \nBits Bit Name  Description  \n7:0 MCLK_COUNT  This register allows the user to determine the frequency of the internal/external oscillator. Internally , a clock \ncounter increments every 131 pulses of the sampling clock  (614.4 kHz in full power mode, 153.6 kHz in mid power \nmode , and 768 kHz in low power mode) . The 8 -bit counter wraps around on reaching its maximum value. The \ncounter output is read back via th is register.  \n  Note that the incrementation of the register is asynchronous to the register read. If a register read coincides with \nthe register incrementation, it is possible to read an invalid value. To prevent  this, read the register four times rather \nthan once, then read the register four times again at a later point.  By reading four values, it is possible to identify the \ncorrect register value at the start and at the end of the timing instants.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAD7124-8 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

By default, only the \nenable bit for Channel 0 is set. The order of conversions starts with the lowest enabled channel, then cycles \nthrough successively higher channel numbers, before  wrapping around to the lowest channel again. \n  When the ADC writes a result for a particular channel, the four LSBs of the status register are set to the channel \nnumber, 0 to 15. This allows the channel the data corres ponds to be identified.
