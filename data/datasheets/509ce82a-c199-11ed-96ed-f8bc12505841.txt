MIC5365/6  \n \n  \nJuly 16, 2013  10 Revision 3.1  \n Applica tion Information  \nMIC5365 and MIC5366 are Low noise 150mA LDO s. \nThe MIC5366 includes an auto- discharge circuit that is \nswitched on when the regulator is disabled through the \nEnable pin. The MIC5365/6 regulator is fully protected \nfrom damage due to fault con ditions, offering linear \ncurrent limiting and thermal shutdown.  \nInput Capacitor  \nThe MIC5365/6 is a high- performance, high bandwidth \ndevice. A n input capacitor of  1µF is required from the \ninput to ground to provide stability. Low -ESR ceramic \ncapacitors prov ide optimal performance at a minimum of \nspace. Additional high- frequency capacitors, such as \nsmall -valued NPO dielectric -type capacitors, help filter \nout high- frequency noise and are good practice in any \nRF-based circuit. X5R or X7R dielectrics are \nrecommended for the input capacitor. Y5V dielectrics lose most of their capacitance over temperature and are \ntherefore, not recommended.  \nOutput Capacitor  \nThe MIC5365/6 requires an output capacitor of 1 µF or \ngreater to maintain stability. The design is optimized for \nuse with low -ESR ceramic chip capacitors. High ESR \ncapacitors are not recommended because they may \ncause high frequency oscillation. The output capacitor \ncan be increased, but performance has been optimized for a 1 µF ceramic output capacitor and does not improve \nsignificantly with larger capacitance.  \nX7R/X5R dielectric -type ceramic capacitors are \nrecommended because of their temperature \nperformance. X7R -type capacitors change capacitance \nby 15% over their operating temperature range and are \nthe most st able type of ceramic capacitors. Z5U and \nY5V dielectric capacitors change value by as much as \n50% and 60%, respectively, over their operating \ntemperature ranges. To use a ceramic chip capacitor \nwith Y5V dielectric, the value must be much higher than an X7R  ceramic capacitor to ensure the same minimum \ncapacitance over the equivalent operating temperature range.  \nNo-Load Stability  \nUnlike many other voltage regulators, the MIC5365/6 will remain stable and in regulation with no load. This is especially important  in CMOS RAM keep- alive \napplications . Enable/Shutdown  \nThe MIC5365/6 comes with an active- high enable pin \nthat allows the regulator to be disabled. Forcing the enable pin low disables the regulator and sends it into a \n“zero” off -mode- current state. In this  state, current \nconsumed by the regulator goes nearly to zero. Forcing \nthe enable pin high enables the output voltage. The \nactive -high enable pin uses CMOS technology and the \nenable pin cannot be left floating; a floating enable pin \nmay cause an indeterminate state on the output . \nThermal Considerations  \nThe MIC5365/6 is designed to provide 150mA of \ncontinuous current in a very small package. Maximum \nambient operating temperature can be calculated based \non the output current and the voltage drop across the \npart. For example if the input voltage is 3.6V, the output \nvoltage is 2.8V, and the output current = 150mA. The \nactual power dissipation of the regulator circuit can be \ndetermined using the equation:  \n \nP\nD = (V IN – VOUT1) I OUT + V IN IGND \n \nBecause this device is CMOS and the ground current is \ntypically <100µA over the load range, the power \ndissipation contributed by the ground current is < 1% and can be ignored for this calculation:  \n \n P\nD = (3.6V – 2.8V) × 15 0mA \n PD = 0.120W \n \nTo determine the maximum ambient operating \ntemperature of the package, use the junction- to-ambient \nthermal resistance of the device and the following basic equation:  \n \n \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb−\n=\nJAA J(max)\nD(MAX)θT T\nP  \n \nTJ(max) = 125°C, the maximum junction temperature of the \ndie, θJA thermal resistance = 25 0°C/W  for the YMT \npackage, 256.5°C/W  for the SC -70-5 package and \n235°C/W  for the MIC5365/6 in the TSOT23- 5 package . \nMicrel, Inc.  MIC5365/6  \n \n  \nJuly 16, 2013  11 Revision 3.1  \n Substituting P D for P D(max)  and solving for the ambient \noperating temperature will give the maximum operating \nconditions for the regulator circuit. The junction- to-\nambient thermal resistance for the minimum footprint is \n250°C/W.  \nThe maximum power dissipation must not be exceeded \nfor proper operation.  \nFor example, when operating the MIC5365- 2.8YMT at \nan input voltage of 3.6V and 150mA load with a \nminim um footprint layout, the maximum ambient \noperating temperature T A can be determined as follows:  \n \n 0.120W = (125°C –  TA)/(250°C/W)  \n TA = 95°C  \n \nTherefore the maximum ambient operating temperature \nof 95°C is allowed in a 1mm x 1mm MLF package.
