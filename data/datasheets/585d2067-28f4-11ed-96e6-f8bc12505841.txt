Fabricated  with advanced CMOS technology, \nthe EEPROM–based MAX 3000A devi ces operate with a 3.3-V supply \nvoltage and provide 600 to 10,000 usable gates, ISP, pin-to-pin delays as \nfast as 4.5 ns, and counter speeds of up to 227.3 MHz. MAX 3000A devices in the –4, –5, –6, –7, and –10 speed gr ades are compatible with the timing \nrequirements of the PCI Specia l Interest Group (PCI SIG) PCI Local Bus \nSpecification, Revision 2.2 . See Table 2 .\nAltera Corporation  3MAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nThe MAX 3000A architecture supports 100 % transistor-to-transistor logic \n(TTL) emulation and high–density small-scale integration (SSI), \nmedium-scale integration (MSI), and large-scale integration (LSI) logic \nfunctions. The MAX 3000A ar chitecture easily integrates multiple devices \nranging from PALs, GALs, and 22V 10s to MACH and pLSI devices. \nMAX 3000A devices are available in a wide range of packages, including \nPLCC, PQFP, and TQFP packages.

Each macrocell has a programmable– AND/fixed–OR array and a configurable register with \nindependently programmable clock, clock enable, clear, and preset \nfunctions. To build complex logic functions, each macrocell can be \nsupplemented with shareable expa nder and high–speed parallel \nexpander product terms to provide up  to 32 product terms per macrocell.\nMAX 3000A devices provide programmable speed/power optimization. \nSpeed–critical portions of a design can run at high speed/full power, while the remaining portions run at reduced speed/low power. This speed/power optimization feature enables the designer to configure one or more macrocells to operate at 50 % or lower power while adding only a \nnominal timing delay. MAX 3000A devi ces also provide an option that \nreduces the slew rate of the output buffers, minimizing noise transients \nwhen non–speed–critical signals are sw itching. The output drivers of all \nMAX 3000A devices can be set for 2.5 V  or 3.3 V, and all input pins are \n2.5–V, 3.3–V, and 5.0-V tolerant, allo wing MAX 3000A devices to be used \nin mixed–voltage systems.\nMAX 3000A devices are supported by  Altera development systems, \nwhich are integrated packages that  offer schematic,  text—including \nVHDL, Verilog HDL, and the Altera  Hardware Description Language \n(AHDL)—and waveform design entry, compilation and logic synthesis, simulation and timing analysis, and device programming. The software provides EDIF 2 0 0 and 3 0 0, LPM, VHDL, Verilog HDL, and other interfaces for additional design en try and simulation support from other \nindustry–standard PC– and UNIX–workstation–based EDA tools. The \nsoftware runs on Windows–based PCs,  as well as Sun SPARCstation, and \nHP 9000 Series 700/800 workstations.\nfFor more information on development tools, see the MAX+PLUS II \nProgrammable Logic Development System & Software Data Sheet  and the \nQuartus Programmable Logic Develo pment System & So ftware Data Sheet .\nFunctional \nDescriptionThe MAX 3000A architecture incl udes the following elements: \n■ Logic array blocks (LABs)\n■ Macrocells\n■ Expander product terms (shareable and parallel)\n■ Programmable interco nnect array (PIA)\n■ I/O control blocks\nThe MAX 3000A architecture  includes four dedicated inputs that can be \nused as general–purpose inputs or as  high–speed, global  control signals \n(clock, clear, and two output enable signals) for each macrocell and I/O \npin. Figure 1  shows the architecture  of MAX 3000A devices.\nAltera Corporation  5MAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 1.

EPM3512A devices have \n10 output enables.\nLogic Array Blocks\nThe MAX 3000A device architecture  is based on the linking of \nhigh–performance LABs. LABs consist of 16–macro cell arrays, as shown \nin Figure 1 . Multiple LABs are linked together via the PIA, a global bus \nthat is fed by all dedicated inpu t pins, I/O pins, and macrocells. \nEach LAB is fed by the following signals:\n■ 36 signals from the PI A that are used for general logic inputs\n■ Global controls that are used for secondary register functions6 or 106 or 10INPUT/GCLRn\n6 or 10 Output Enables (1) 6 or 10 Output Enables (1) \n1636 36\n16I/O\nControl\nBlockLAB C LAB D\nI/O\nControl\nBlock\n6 or 101636 36\n16I/O\nControl\nBlockLAB A\nMacrocells\n1 to 16LAB B\nI/O\nControl\nBlock\n6 or 10\nPIAINPUT/GCLK1\nINPUT/OE2/GCLK2\nINPUT/OE1\n2 to 16 I/O\n2 to 16 I/O2 to 16 I/O\n2 to 16 I/O2 to\n162 to\n16\n2 to\n162 to\n16\n2 to 16 2 to 16\n2 to 16 2 to 16Macrocells\n17 to 32\nMacrocells\n33 to 48Macrocells\n49 to 64\n6 Altera CorporationMAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nMacrocells\nMAX 3000A macrocells can be indivi dually configured for either \nsequential or combinatorial logic oper ation. Macrocells consist of three \nfunctional blocks: logic array, product–term select matrix, and \nprogrammable register. Figure 2  shows a MAX 3000A macrocell.\nFigure 2. MAX 3000A Macrocell\nCombinatorial logic is implemented in the logic array, which provides \nfive product terms per macrocell. The product–term select matrix \nallocates these product terms for use as  either primary logic inputs (to the \nOR and XOR gates) to implement combinator ial functions, or as secondary \ninputs to the macrocell’s register pr eset, clock, and clock enable control \nfunctions. \nTwo kinds of expander product terms (“expanders”) are available to \nsupplement macrocell logic resources:\n■ Shareable expanders, which are inve rted product terms that are fed \nback into the logic array\n■ Parallel expanders, which are prod uct terms borrowed from adjacent \nmacrocells\nThe Altera development system auto matically optimizes product–term \nallocation according to the logi c requirements of the design.\nProduct-\nTerm\nSelect\nMatrix\n36 Si gnals\nfrom PIA16 Ex pander\nProduct Term sLAB Local Arra y\nParallel Lo gic\nExpander s\n(from other\nmacrocells )\nShared Lo gic\nExpander sClear \nSelectGlobal \nClearGlobal \nClocks\nClock/ \nEnable \nSelect2\nPRN\nCLRNQ\nENARegister\nBypass\nTo I/O\nControl\nBlock\nTo PIAProgrammable\nRegister\nVCCD/T\nAltera Corporation  7MAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFor registered functions, each macr ocell flipflop can be individually \nprogrammed to implement D, T, JK, or  SR operation with programmable \nclock control. The flipflop can be by passed for combinatorial operation. \nDuring design entry, the designer sp ecifies the desired flipflop type; the \nAltera development system software  then selects the most efficient \nflipflop operation for each register ed function to optimize resource \nutilization.\nEach programmable register can be clocked in three different modes:\n■ Global clock signal mode, which ac hieves the fastest clock–to–output \nperformance.\n■ Global clock signal enabled by an  active–high cloc k enable. A clock \nenable is generated by a product te rm. This mode provides an enable \non each flipflop while still ac hieving the fast clock–to–output \nperformance of the global clock.\n■ Array clock implemented with a pr oduct term. In this mode, the \nflipflop can be clocked by signals fr om buried macroce lls or I/O pins.\nTwo global clock signals are availa ble in MAX 3000A devices. As shown \nin Figure 1 , these global clock signals can be the true or the complement of \neither of the two global clock pins, GCLK1  or GCLK2 .\nEach register also supports asynchronous preset and clear functions. As \nshown in Figure 2 , the product–term select matrix allocates product terms \nto control these operations. Although  the product–term –driven preset \nand clear from the register are acti ve high, active–low control can be \nobtained by inverting the signal within th e logic array. In addition, each \nregister clear function can be indi vidually driven by the active–low \ndedicated global clear pin ( GCLRn ).\nAll registers are cleared upon power-up . By default, all registered outputs \ndrive low when the device is powered up. You can set the registered outputs to drive high upon po wer-up through the Quartus\n®II software. \nQuartus II software uses the NOT Ga te Push-Back method , which uses an \nadditional macrocell to set the output high. To set this in the Quartus II \nsoftware, go to the Assignment Editor and set the Power-Up Level  \nassignment for the register to High . \n8 Altera CorporationMAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nExpander Product Terms\nAlthough most logic func tions can be implemented with the five product \nterms available in each macrocell, highly complex logic functions require additional produc t terms. Another macrocell can be used to supply the \nrequired logic resources. However,  the MAX 3000A architecture also \noffers both shareable and parallel ex pander product te rms (“expanders”) \nthat provide additional product term s directly to any macrocell in the \nsame LAB. These expanders help ensure that logic is synthesized with the fewest possible logic resources to obtain the fastest possible speed. \nShareable Expanders\nEach LAB has 16 shareable expanders that can be viewed as a pool of uncommitted single product terms (o ne from each macrocell) with \ninverted outputs that feed back in to the logic array. Each shareable \nexpander can be used and shared by any or all macrocells in the LAB to \nbuild complex logic functions. Shareable expanders incur a small delay (t\nSEXP ). Figure 3  shows how shareable expanders can feed multiple \nmacrocells.\nFigure 3. MAX 3000A Shareable Expanders\nShareable expanders can be  shared by any or all macrocells in an LAB.\nMacrocell\nProduct-Ter m\nLogic\nProduc t-Term Select Matrix\nMacrocellProduct-Ter\nm\nLogic\n36 Si gnals\nfrom PIA16 Shared\nExpander s\nAltera Corporation  9MAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nParallel Expanders\nParallel expanders are unused product terms that can be allocated to a \nneighboring macrocell to implement fast, complex logic functions. \nParallel expanders allow up to 20 pr oduct terms to directly feed the \nmacrocell OR logic, with five product term s provided by the macrocell and \n15 parallel expanders provided by neig hboring macrocells in the LAB. \nThe Altera development system compiler can automatically allocate up to \nthree sets of up to five parallel ex panders to the macrocells that require \nadditional product terms. Each set of  five parallel expanders incurs a \nsmall, incremental timing delay ( tPEXP ). For example, if a macrocell \nrequires 14 product terms, the compil er uses the five dedicated product \nterms within the macrocell and allocate s two sets of parallel expanders; \nthe first set includes five  product terms, and the second set includes four \nproduct terms, increasi ng the total delay by 2 × tPEXP .\nTwo groups of eight macrocells within each LAB (e.g., macrocells 1 \nthrough 8 and 9 through 16) form tw o chains to lend or borrow parallel \nexpanders. A macrocell borrows parallel expanders from lower–numbered macrocells. For example,  macrocell 8 can borrow parallel \nexpanders from macrocell 7, from macr ocells 7 and 6, or from macrocells \n7, 6, and 5. Within each group of eight, the lowest–numbered macrocell \ncan only lend parallel expanders and the highest–numbered macrocell can only borrow them. Figure 4  shows how parallel expanders can be \nborrowed from a neighboring macrocell.\n10 Altera CorporationMAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 4. MAX 3000A Parallel Expanders\nUnused product terms in a macrocell can be allocated to a neighboring macrocell.\nProgrammable Inte rconnect Array\nLogic is routed between LABs on the PIA. This global bus is a \nprogrammable path that connects any signal source to any destination on \nthe device. All MAX 3000A  dedicated inputs, I/O pins, and macrocell \noutputs feed the PIA, which makes th e signals availabl e throughout the \nentire device. Only the signals requir ed by each LAB are actually routed \nfrom the PIA into the LAB. Figure 5  shows how the PIA signals are routed \ninto the LAB. An EEPROM cell controls one input to a two-input AND gate, \nwhich selects a PIA signal to drive into the LAB.Preset\nClock\nClearProduct-\ner\nSelect\nMatrix\nPreset\nClock\nClearProduct-\nTerTTm\nSelect\nMatrixMacrocell\nProduct-\nTerm LogicFrom\nPrevious\nMacrocell\nTo Next\nMacrocellMacrocell\nProduct-\nTerm Logic\n36 Signals\nfrom PIA16 Shared\nExpanders\nAltera Corporation  11MAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 5. MAX 3000A PIA Routing\nWhile the routing delays of channel– based routing schemes in masked or \nFPGAs are cumulative, variable, and path–dependent, the MAX 3000A \nPIA has a predictable delay. The PIA makes a design’s timing performance easy to predict.\nI/O Control Blocks\nThe I/O control block allows each I/O pin to be individually configured for input, output, or bidirectional oper ation. All I/O pins have a tri–state \nbuffer that is individually controlled by one of the global output enable \nsignals or directly connected to ground or V\nCC. Figure 6  shows the I/O \ncontrol block for MAX 3000A devices.  The I/O control block has 6 or \n10 global output enable signals that ar e driven by the true or complement \nof two output enable sign als, a subset of the I/O pins, or a subset of the \nI/O macrocells.To LAB\nPIA Signals\n12 Altera CorporationMAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 6.

When the tri–state buffer control is connected to V\nCC, the output is \nenabled.\nThe MAX 3000A architecture provid es dual I/O feedback, in which \nmacrocell and pin feedbacks are in dependent.

In-system \nprogrammability (ISP) offers quick, efficient iterations during design development and debugging cycl es. The MAX 3000A architecture \ninternally generates the high progra mming voltages required to program \nits EEPROM cells, allowing in–system programming with only a single 3.3–V power supply. During in–syste m programming, the I/O pins are \ntri–stated and weakly pulled–up to eliminate board conflicts. The pull–up value is nominally 50 k Ω.\nMAX 3000A devices have an enha nced ISP algorithm for faster \nprogramming. These de vices also offer an ISP_Done  bit that ensures safe \noperation when in–system prog ramming is interrupted. This ISP_Done  \nbit, which is the last bit programmed, prevents all I/O pins from driving until the bit is programmed.\nISP simplifies the manufacturing flow by allowing devices to be mounted \non a printed circuit board (PCB) with  standard pick–and–place equipment \nbefore they are progra mmed. MAX 3000A devices can be programmed by \ndownloading the information via in–circuit testers, embedded processors, the MasterBlaster communications cabl e, the ByteBlasterMV parallel port \ndownload cable, and the BitBlaster serial download cable. Programming the devices after they are placed on the board eliminates lead damage on \nhigh–pin–count packages (e.g., QFP packages) due to device handling. \nMAX 3000A devices can be reprogra mmed after a system has already \nshipped to the field. For example, product upgrades can be performed in \nthe field via software or modem. \nThe Jam STAPL programming and test language can be used to program \nMAX 3000A devices with in–circuit test ers, PCs, or embe dded processors.\nfFor more information on using th e Jam STAPL programming and test \nlanguage, see Application Note 88 (Using the Jam Language for ISP & ICR via \nan Embedded Processor) , Application Note 122 (Usi ng Jam STAPL for ISP & \nICR via an Embedded Processor)  and AN 111 (Embedded Programming Using \nthe 8051 and Jam Byte-Code) .\nThe ISP circuitry in MAX 3000A device s is compliant with the IEEE Std. \n1532 specification. The IEEE Std. 1532 is a standard developed to allow concurrent ISP between multiple PLD vendors.\n14 Altera CorporationMAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nProgramming Sequence\nDuring in-system progra mming, instructions, addresses, and data are \nshifted into the MAX 3000A  device through the TDI input pin. Data is \nshifted out through the TDO output pin and compared against the \nexpected data. \nProgramming a pattern into the device requires the following six ISP \nstages. A stand-alone verification of a programmed pattern involves only \nstages 1, 2, 5, and 6.\n1. Enter ISP . The enter ISP stage ensures th at the I/O pins transition \nsmoothly from user mode to ISP mode. The enter ISP stage requires \n1m s .\n2. Check ID . Before any program or verify  process, the silicon ID is \nchecked. The time required to read this silicon ID is relatively small compared to the overall programming time.\n3. Bulk Erase . Erasing the device in-system involves shifting in the \ninstructions to erase the device and applying one erase pulse of 100 ms.\n4. Program . Programming the device in-system involves shifting in the \naddress and data and then appl ying the programming pulse to \nprogram the EEPROM cells. This process is repeated for each \nEEPROM address.\n5. Verify . Verifying an Altera device in-system involves shifting in \naddresses, applying the read pulse to verify the EEPROM cells, and shifting out the data for comparis on. This process is repeated for \neach EEPROM address.\n6. Exit ISP . An exit ISP stage ensures th at the I/O pins transition \nsmoothly from ISP mode to user mo de. The exit ISP stage requires \n1m s .\nProgramming Times\nThe time required to implement each  of the six programming stages can \nbe broken into the fo llowing two elements:\n■ A pulse time to erase, progra m, or read the EEPROM cells.\n■ A shifting time based on the test clock ( TCK) frequency and the \nnumber of TCK cycles to shift instructions , address, and data into the \ndevice.\nAltera Corporation  15MAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nBy combining the pulse and shift ti mes for each of the programming \nstages, the program or verify time ca n be derived as a function of the TCK \nfrequency, the number of devices, and specific target device(s). Because different ISP-capable devices have a different number of EEPROM cells, both the total fixed and total variable times are unique for a single device. \nProgramming a Single MAX 3000A Device\nThe time required to program a si ngle MAX 3000A device in-system can \nbe calculated from the following formula:\nwhere: tPROG = Programming time\ntPPULSE = Sum of the fixed times to erase, program, and \nverify the EEPROM cells\nCyclePTCK  = Number of TCK cycles to program a device\nfTCK =TCK frequency\nThe ISP times for a stand-alone verifi cation of a single MAX 3000A device \ncan be calculated from the following formula:\nwhere: tVER =V e r i f y  t i m e\ntVPULSE = Sum of the fixed times to verify the EEPROM cells\nCycleVTCK  = Number of TCK cycles to verify a devicetPROGtPPULSECyclePTCK\nfTCK------------------------------- - + =\ntVERtVPULSECycleVTCK\nfTCK--------------------------------+ =\n16 Altera CorporationMAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nThe programming times described in Tables 4  through 6 are associated \nwith the worst-case method using the enhanced ISP algorithm.\nTables 5  and 6 show the in-system programming and stand alone \nverification times for several common test clock frequencies.

This \nfeature allows total power dissipation to be reduced by 50 % or more \nbecause most logic applications require only a small fraction of all gates to \noperate at maximum frequency.\nThe designer can program each in dividual macrocell in a MAX 3000A \ndevice for either high–speed or low–power operation. As a result, speed-critical paths in the design can run at high speed, while the remaining paths can operate at reduced power. Macrocells that run at low \npower incur a nominal timing delay adder ( t\nLPA) for the tLAD, tLAC, tIC, \ntACL, tEN, tCPPW  and tSEXP  parameters. \nOutput \nConfigurationMAX 3000A device outputs can be programmed to meet a variety of \nsystem–level requirements.\nMultiVolt I/O Interface\nThe MAX 3000A device architecture su pports the MultiVolt I/O interface \nfeature, which allows MAX 3000A devices to connect to systems with differing supply voltages. MAX 3000A de vices in all packages can be set \nfor 2.5–V, 3.3–V, or 5.0–V I/O pin operation. These devices have one set of \nV\nCC pins for internal oper ation and input buffers ( VCCINT ), and another \nset for I/O output drivers ( VCCIO ).\nThe VCCIO  pins can be connected to either  a 3.3–V or 2.5–V power supply, \ndepending on the output requirements. When the VCCIO  pins are \nconnected to a 2.5–V power supply, the output levels are compatible with \n2.5–V systems. When the VCCIO  pins are connected to a 3.3–V power \nsupply, the output high is at 3.3 V an d is therefore compatible with 3.3-V \nor 5.0–V systems. Devices operating with VCCIO  levels lower than 3.0 V \nincur a nominally greater timing delay of tOD2 instead of tOD1. Inputs can \nalways be driven by 2.5–V , 3.3–V, or 5.0–V signals. \nTable 11  summarizes the MAX 3000A MultiVolt I/O support.\nNote:\n(1) When VCCIO  is 3.3 V, a MAX 3000A device can drive a 2.5–V device that has 3.3–V \ntolerant inputs.Table 11.

This open–drain output enables \nthe device to provide system–level control signals (e.g., interrupt and write enable signals) that can be assert ed by any of several devices. It can \nalso provide an additional wired– OR plane.\nOpen-drain output pins on MAX 3000A  devices (with a pull-up resistor to \nthe 5.0-V supply) can drive 5.0-V CMOS  input pins that require a high V\nIH. \nWhen the open-drain pin is active, it will drive low. When the pin is \ninactive, the resistor  will pull up the trace to  5.0 V, thereby meeting CMOS \nrequirements. The open-drain  pin will only drive low or tri-state; it will \nnever drive high. The rise time is de pendent on the valu e of the pull-up \nresistor and load impedance. The IOL current specification should be \nconsidered when selecting a pull-up resistor\nSlew–Rate Control\nThe output buffer for each MAX 3000A I/O pin has an adjustable output \nslew rate that can be configured for low–noise or high–speed performance. A faster slew rate pr ovides high–speed  transitions for \nhigh-performance systems. However, these fast transitions may introduce \nnoise transients into the system. A slow slew rate reduces system noise, but adds a nominal delay of 4 to 5 ns. When the configuration cell is turned off, the slew rate is set fo r low–noise performance. Each I/O pin \nhas an individual EEPROM bit that co ntrols the slew rate, allowing \ndesigners to specify the slew rate on  a pin–by–pin basis. The slew rate \ncontrol affects both the rising and falling edges of the output signal.\nDesign SecurityAll MAX 3000A devices contain a progra mmable security bit that controls \naccess to the data programmed into  the device. When this bit is \nprogrammed, a design implemented in  the device cannot be copied or \nretrieved. This feature provides a high level of design security because programmed data within EEPROM cells is  invisible. The security bit that \ncontrols this functi on, as well as all other prog rammed data, is reset only \nwhen the device is reprogrammed. \nGeneric TestingMAX 3000A devices are fully tested. Complete testing of each programmable EEPROM bit and all in ternal logic elements ensures 100 % \nprogramming yield. AC test measurements are taken under conditions equivalent to those shown in Figure 8 . Test patterns can be used and then \nerased during early stages  of the production flow. \n22 Altera CorporationMAX 3000A Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 8.

The ICCINT  value is calculated with  the following equation:\nICCINT  = \n(A × MCTON) + [B × (MCDEV – MCTON)] + (C × MCUSED  × fMAX  × togLC)\nThe parameters in the ICCINT  equation are:\nMCTON = Number of macrocells with the Turbo BitTM option turned \non, as reported in the Quar tus II or MAX+PLUS II Report\nFile ( .rpt)\nMCDEV = Number of macrocells in the device\nMCUSED = Total number of macrocells in  the design, as reported in \nthe RPT File\nfMAX = Highest clock frequency to the device\ntogLC = Average percentage of logic cells toggling at each clock \n(typically 12.5 %)\nA, B, C = Constants (shown in Table 26 )\nThe ICCINT  calculation provides an ICC estimate based on typical \nconditions using a pattern of a 16–bit, loadable, enabled, up/down counter in each LAB with no output load. Actual I\nCC should be verified \nduring operation because this meas urement is sensitive to the actual \npattern in the device and the en vironmental operating conditions. \nFigures 12  and 13 show the typical supply cu rrent versus frequency for \nMAX 3000A devices.Table 26.
