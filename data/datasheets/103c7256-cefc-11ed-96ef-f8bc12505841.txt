The operating characteristics are for operation in the A direction ( ). \nPrecautions \n★Please refer to "Basic Switches Comm on Precautions" fo r correct use. \n●Soldering \n\x81 Terminal connection\nWhen soldering, make s ure that the temperat ure of the \nsoldering iron tip is not higher than 300°C, and complete the \nsoldering within 3 seconds. Do not apply any external force for \n1 min ute after soldering. Soldering at an excessi vely high \ntemperat ure or soldering for more than 3 seconds may \ndeteriorate the characteristics of the S witch. \n\x81 Connecting to PCB terminal Boards\nWhen using a utomatic soldering baths, we recommend \nsoldering at 260°C ±5°C within 5 seconds. Make s ure that the \nliquid surface of the solder does not flo w over the edge of the \nboard.\nWhen soldering terminals man ually, perform soldering within 3 \nseconds at iron tip temperat ure not higher than 350°C. Do not \napply any external force for at least 1 min ute after soldering. \nWhen applying solder, keep the solder a way from the case of \nthe S witch and do not allo w solder or fl ux to flo w into the case. ●Mounting \nUse M2 mo unting scre ws with plane washers or spring washers \nto sec urely mo unt the S witch. Tighten the scre ws to a torq ue of \n0.08 to 0.1 N·m {0.8 to 1 kgf·cm}. \n●Using Micro Loads \nUsing a model for ordinary loads to open or close the contact of \na micro load circ uit may res ult in fa ulty contact. Use models that \noperate in the follo wing range. Ho wever, even when using micro \nload models within the follo wing operating range, if inr ush \ncurrent occ urs when the contact is opened or closed, it may \nincrease the contact wear and so decrease d urability. Therefore, \ninsert a contact protection circ uit where necessary. The \nminim um applicable load is the N-level reference value. This \nvalue indicates the malf unction reference le vel for the reliability \nlevel of 60% ( λ60). \n(JIS C5003) \nThe eq uation, λ60=0.5×10-6/operation, indicates that the \nestimated malf unction rate is less than  operations \nwith a reliability le vel of 60%. ●Hinge Roller Lever Models \nD2F-L2 @ \nD2F-01L2 @ \nD2F-FL2 @ \nD2F-01FL2 @ Operating \nCharacteristics Model D2F-L2 @\nD2F-01L2 @D2F-FL2 @\nD2F-01FL2 @\nOperating Force OF Max. \nReleasing Force RF Min. 0.78 N {80 gf}\n0.05 N {5 gf}0.39 N {40 gf}\n0.02 N {2 gf}\nOvertravel OT Min. \nMovement Differential MD Max. 0.55 mm \n 0.5 mm 0.55 mm \n 0.5 mm \nFree Position FP Max. \nOperating Position OP 16.5 mm \n13±2 mm \n(10)412.8\nt=0.3 *1(4.6)\n*1.
