Patent Protected. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited.  © 2020 MPS. All Rights Reserved. OPERATION \nThe MPM3804 uses a constant-on-time (COT) \ncontrol with input voltage feed-forward to stabilize the switching frequency over the full input range. The MPM3804 achieves 0.6A of continuous output current from a 2.3V to 5.5V input voltage range with excellent load and line regulation. The output voltage can be regulated as low as 0.6V. \nConstant-On-Time (COT) Control \nCompared to fixed-frequency PWM control, \nconstant-on-time (COT) control offers a simpler control loop and faster transient response. By using an input voltage feed-forward, the MPM3804 maintains a nearly constant switching frequency across the input and output voltage ranges. The switching pulse on time can be estimated with Equation (1): \n \nOUT\nON\nINVT. 0 . 4 1 7 sV\uf03d\uf06d  (1) \nTo prevent inductor current runaway during the \nload transient, the MPM3804 has a fixed minimum off time of 60ns. This minimum off \ntime limit will not affect operation in steady state \nin any way. \nSleep-Mode Operation  \nThe MPM3804 uses sleep mode to achieve \nhigh efficiency at extremely light loads. In sleep mode, most of the circuit blocks are turned off except for the error amplifier and PWM comparator. Therefore, the operation current is reduced to a minimal value (see Figure 2). \n  Bias\n&\nVoltage\nReference\n0.6V\nFB+\n+\n-FBCOMPSoft start\nE. A.+\n-+\nRamp \ngeneratorSWLo-Iq\nLo-Iq\n \nFigure 2: Operation Blocks at Sleep Mode When the loading becomes lighter, the ripple of \nthe output voltage is bigger and drives the error \namplifier output (EAO) lower. When the EAO \nreaches the internal low threshold, it is clamped \nat that level, and the MPM3804 enters sleep mode. During sleep mode, the valley of the FB \nvoltage is regulated to the internal reference \nvoltage, and the average output voltage is \nslightly higher than the output voltage in \ndiscontinuous conduction mode (DCM) or continuous conduction mode (CCM). The on-\ntime pulse in sleep mode is around 40% larger \nthan that in DCM or CCM. Figure 3 shows the average FB voltage relationship with the internal reference in sleep mode. \n \nFigure 3: FB Average Voltage in Sleep Mode \nWhen the MPM3804 is in sleep mode, the \naverage output voltage is higher than the \ninternal reference voltage. The EAO is kept low \nand clamped in sleep mode. When the load increases, the PWM switching period decreases to keep the output voltage regulated, \nand the output voltage ripple decreases \nrelatively. Once the EAO is higher than the \ninternal low threshold, the MPM3804 exits sleep \nmode and enters DCM or CCM depending on \nthe load. In DCM or CCM, the error amplifier \nregulates the average output voltage to the internal reference (see Figure 4). \n \nFigure 4: DCM Control \nThere is always a loading hysteresis when entering and exiting sleep mode due to the error amplifier clamping response time.  \nAAM Operation at Light-Load Operation \nThe MPM3804 uses advanced asynchronous \nmodulation (AAM) power-save mode together \nwith a zero-current cross detection (ZCD) circuit \nfor light load. The MPM3804 has AAM power-save mode for light load. Figure 5 shows the simplified AAM control theory. The AAM current \n(I\nAAM) is set internally. In light-load condition, the \nSW on pulse time is determined by the on-time \ngenerator and AAM comparator.  \nMPM3804 – 0.6A, 5.5V INPUT STEP-DOWN MODULE SYNCHRONOUS  \nREGULATOR WITH INTEGRATED INDUCTOR IN ULTRA-SMALL 2X2X0.9MM QFN PACKAGE \n  \nMPM3804 Rev. 1.1 www.MonolithicPower.com  13  \n6/8/2020 MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protected. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited.  © 2020 MPS. All Rights Reserved. \n \nFigure 5: Simplified AAM Control Logic \nThe MPM3804 uses a ZCD to determine when \nthe inductor current starts to reverse. When the inductor current reaches the ZCD threshold, the low-side switch is turned off.  \nAAM mode together with the ZCD circuit makes \nthe MPM3804 work in DCM at light load \ncontinuously, even if V\nOUT is close to VIN. \nEnable (EN) \nWhen the input voltage is greater than the \nunder-voltage lockout (UVLO) threshold \n(typically 2V), the MPM3804 can be enabled by \npulling EN higher than 1.2V. Leave EN floating \nor pull EN down to ground to disable the MPM3804. There is an internal 1M Ω resistor \nfrom EN to ground. \nWhen the device is disabled, the part goes into \noutput discharge mode automatically. The \ninternal discharge MOSFET provides a resistive \ndischarge path for the output capacitor. \nSoft Start (SS) \nThe MPM3804 has a built-in soft start (SS) that \nramps up the output voltage at a controlled slew \nrate to avoid overshooting at start-up. The soft-\nstart time is about 0.5ms for V\nOUT rising from \n10% to 90% typically. Power Good Indicator (only for \nMPM3804GG-XX) \nThe MPM3804 has an open drain and requires \nan external pull-up resistor (100k Ω~500kΩ) for \nthe power good (PG) indicator. When V FB is \nwithin -10% of regulation voltage, V PG is pulled \nup to VIN by the external resistor. If V FB \nexceeds the -10% window, the internal MOSFET pulls PG to ground. The MOSFET has a maximum R\nDS(ON)  of less than 100 Ω. \nCurrent Limit \nThe MPM3804 has a 1.3A, high-side, switch-\ncurrent limit, typically. When the high-side switch reaches its current limit, the MPM3804 remains in hiccup mode until the current drops. This prevents the inductor current from continuing to rise and damaging components. \nShort Circuit and Recovery  \nThe MPM3804 enters short-circuit protection \n(SCP) mode when it reaches the current limit and attempts to recover with hiccup mode. The MPM3804 disables the output power stage, discharges the soft-start capacitor, and attempts to soft start automatically. If the short-\ncircuit condition remains after the soft start ends, \nthe MPM3804 repeats this cycle until the short \ncircuit is removed and the output rises back to regulation levels. \nMPM3804 – 0.6A, 5.5V INPUT STEP-DOWN MODULE SYNCHRONOUS  \nREGULATOR WITH INTEGRATED INDUCTOR IN ULTRA-SMALL 2X2X0.9MM QFN PACKAGE \n  \nMPM3804 Rev. 1.1 www.MonolithicPower.com  14  \n6/8/2020 MPS Proprietary Information.

APPLICATION INFORMATION  \nSetting the Output Voltage (only for \nMPM3804GG) \nThe external resistor divider sets the output \nvoltage (see the Typical Application Circuits on page 15). Select the feedback resistor (R1) to \nreduce the V\nOUT leakage current, typically \nbetween 40k Ω to 200k Ω. There is no strict \nrequirement on the feedback resistor. R1 > \n10kΩ is reasonable for most applications. R2 \ncan be calculated with Equation (2): \n \noutR1R2V10.6\uf03d\n\uf02d (2) \nFigure 6 shows the feedback circuit. \n \nFigure 6: Feedback Network \nTable 1 lists the recommended resistor values \nfor common output voltages. \nTable 1: Resistor Values for Common Output \nVoltages \nVOUT (V) R1 (k Ω) R2 (k Ω) \n1.0 200 (1%) 300 (1%) \n1.2 200 (1%) 200 (1%) \n1.8 200 (1%) 100 (1%) \n2.5 200 (1%) 63.2 (1%) \n3.3 200 (1%) 44.2 (1%) \nSelecting the Input Capacitor \nThe input current to the step-down converter is \ndiscontinuous and therefore requires a capacitor to supply AC current to the step-down converter while maintaining the DC input \nvoltage. Use low ESR capacitors for the best \nperformance. Ceramic capacitors with X5R or \nX7R dielectrics are highly recommended because of their low ESR and small temperature coefficients. Typically, a 10µF input capacitor is sufficient for most applications. The input capacitor requires an adequate ripple \ncurrent rating since it absorbs the input \nswitching current. Estimate the RMS current in \nthe input capacitor with Equation (3): \n OUT OUT\nC1 LOAD\nIN INVVII 1VV\uf0e6\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0b4\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf03d\uf0b4 \uf02d  (3) \nThe worst-case scenario occurs at V IN = 2V OUT, \nshown in Equation (4): \n LOAD\nC1II2\uf03d  (4) \nFor simplification, choose an input capacitor \nwith an RMS current rating greater than half of the maximum load current. \nThe input capacitor can be electrolytic, tantalum, \nor ceramic. When using electrolytic or tantalum \ncapacitors, add a small, high-quality, 0.1 μF, \nceramic capacitor as close to the IC as possible. When using ceramic capacitors, ensure that \nthey have enough capacitance to provide a \nsufficient charge to prevent excessive voltage \nripple at the input. The input voltage ripple caused by the capacitance can be estimated with Equation (5): \n LOAD OUT OUT\nIN\nINSI NIV VV1fC 1V V\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf044\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d \uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0b4 \uf0e8\uf0f8 (5) \nSelecting the Output Capacitor \nThe output capacitor (C 2) stabilizes the DC \noutput voltage. Low ESR ceramic capacitors are recommended to limit the output voltage ripple.

The MPM3804 has an internal, \nco-packaged, 1µH power inductor. \nWhen using ceramic capacitors, the \ncapacitance dominates the impedance at the switching frequency and causes most of the output voltage ripple. For simplification, the \noutput voltage ripple can be estimated with \nEquation (7):  \n \nOUT OUT\nOUT 2\nS1 I NVV∆V18f L C 2 V\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf03d\uf0b4 \uf02d \uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf0e8\uf0f8 (7) \nMPM3804 – 0.6A, 5.5V INPUT STEP-DOWN MODULE SYNCHRONOUS  \nREGULATOR WITH INTEGRATED INDUCTOR IN ULTRA-SMALL 2X2X0.9MM QFN PACKAGE \n  \nMPM3804 Rev. 1.1 www.MonolithicPower.com  15  \n6/8/2020 MPS Proprietary Information.

For tantalum or electrolytic capacitors, the ESR \ndominates the impedance at the switching \nfrequency.

Add a 22 μF output \ncapacitor to achieve a low output voltage ripple.   \nPCB Layout Guidelines \nEfficient PCB layout of the switching power \nsupplies is critical for stable operation.
