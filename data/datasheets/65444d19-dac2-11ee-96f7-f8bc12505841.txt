SIGNAL DESCRIPTION \n \n5.1 Chip Select (/CS \nWhen this input signal is high,  the device is deselected and se rial data output pins are at high \nimpedance. Unless an internal program, erase or write status re gister cycle is in progress, the \ndevice will be in the standby power mode (this is not the deep power-down mode. Driving Chip \nSelect (/CS low enables the device, placing it in the active po wer mode. After power-up, a falling \nedge on Chip Select (/CS is requ ired prior to the start of any instruction. \n \n \n5.2 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2 , IO3 \nThe ZD25Q64B supports standard SPI, Dual SPI, Quad SPI and QPI operation. Standard SPI \ninstructions use the serial DI (i nput pin to write instructions , addresses or data to the device on the \nrising edge of the Serial Clock  (CLK input pin. Standard SPI al so uses the serial DO (output to read \ndata or status from the devic e on the falling edge of CLK. \n \nDual, Quad SPI and QPI instructions use the serial IO pins to w rite instructions, addresses or data \nto the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status  from the device on the falling edge \nof CLK. Quad SPI instructions require the non-volatile Quad Ena ble bit (QE in Status Register-2 to \nbe set. When QE=1 the /WP pin beco mes IO2 and /HOLD pin becomes  IO3. \n \n \n5.3 Write Protect (/WP \nThe Write Protect (/WP pin can be used to protect the Status Re gister against data modification. \nUsed in company with the Status Register’s Block Protect (SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits and \nStatus Register Protect (SRP bi ts, a portion or the entire memo ry array can be hardware protected. \nThe /WP pin is active low. When  the QE bit of Status Register-2  is set for Quad I/O, the \n/WP pin (Hardware Write Protect function is not available since  this pin is used for IO2. See figure \n1a, 1b and 1c for the pin configurat ion of Quad I/O and QPI ope ration. \n \n \n5.4 HOLD (/HOLD \nThe /HOLD pin is used to pause any serial communications with t he device without deselecting the \ndevice. When /HOLD goes low, while /CS is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals \non the DI and CLK pins will be ignored (don’t care. When /HOLD goes high, device operation can \nresume. The /HOLD function can be useful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI \nsignals. The /HOLD pin is activ e low. When the QE bit of Status  Register-2 is set Quad I/O, the \n/HOLD pin function is not available since this pin used for IO3 . See figure 1a, 1b and 1c for the pin \nconfiguration of Q uad I/O and operation. \n \n \n5.5 Serial Clock (CLK \nThis input signal provides the timing for the serial interface.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \n \n \nFigure 3. Operation Diagram of ZD25Q64B \n \n6.1 Standard SPI Instructions \nThe ZD25Q64B features a serial peripheral interface on four sig nals: Serial Clock (CLK. Chip \nSelect (/CS, Serial Data Input (DI and Serial Data Output (DO. Standard SPI instructions use the \nDI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of CLK. \nThe DO output pin is used to r ead data or status from the devic e on the falling edge of CLK. \n \nSPI bus operation Modes 0 (0, 0 and 3 (1, 1 are supported. The primary difference between Mode \n0 and Mode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when t he SPI bus master is in standby \nand data is not being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode  0 the CLK signal is normally low on \nthe falling and rising edges of /CS. For Mode 3 the CLK signal is normally high on the falling and \nrising edges of /CS. \n \n6.2 Dual SPI Instructions \nThe ZD25Q64B supports Dual SPI operation. This instruction allo ws data to be transferred to or \nfrom the device at two times the rate of the standard SPI. The Dual Read instruction is ideal for \nquickly downloading code to RAM upon power-up (code-shadowing o r for executing non-speed- \ncritical code directly from t he SPI bus (XIP. When using Dual S PI instructions the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional I/0 pins; IO0 and IO1. \n \n6.3 Quad SPI Instructions \nThe ZD25Q64B supports Quad SPI oper ation. This instruction allo ws data to be transferred to or \nfrom the device at four times the rate of the standard SPI. The  Quad Read instruction offers a \nsignificant improvement in continuous and random access transfe r rates allowing fast code- \nshadowing to RAM or execution di rectly from the SPI bus (XIP. W hen using Quad SPI instruction \nthe DI and DO pins become bidirectional IO0 and IO1, and the /W P and /HOLD pins become IO2 \nand IO3 respectively. Quad SPI instructions require the non-vol atile Quad Enable bit (QE in Status \nRegister-2 to be set. \nZD25Q64B\n 1 2 \n \nActive  Active Hold Hold Active  CLK \n \n/HOLD  \n \n \n6.4 QPI Function \nThe ZD25Q64B supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI operation when the device is switched \nfrom Standard/ Dual/ Quad SPI m ode to QPI mode using the “Enabl e QPI (38h” instruction. To \nenable QPI mode, the non-volatile Q uad Enable bit (QE in Status  Register-2 is required to be set. \nWhen using QPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become bidirect ional IO0 and IO1, and the /WP \nand /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO 3 respectively. See Figure 3 fo r the device operation modes. \n \nThe typical SPI protocol requires that the byte-long instructio n code being shifted into the device \nonly via DI pin in eight serial clocks. The QPI mode utilizes a ll four IO pins to input the instruction \ncode, thus only two serial clocks are required. This can signif icantly reduce the SPI instruction \noverhead and improve system perfo rmance in an XIP environment. Standard/ Dual/ Quad SPI \nmode and QPI mode are exclusive. Only one mode can be active at  any given time, “Enable QPI” \nand “Disable QPI/ Disable QPI 2” instructions are used to switc h between these two modes. Upon \npower-up or after software reset using “Reset (99h instruction,  the default state of the device is \nStandard/ Dual/ Quad SPI mode. \n \n6.5 Hold Function \nThe /HOLD pin is used to pause a serial sequence of the SPI fla sh memory without resetting the \nclocking sequence. To enable the /HOLD mode, the /CS must be in  low state. The /HOLD mode \neffects on with the falling edge of the /HOLD signal with CLK b eing low. The HOLD mode ends on \nthe rising edge o f /HOLD signal wit h CLK being low. \nIn other words, /HOLD mode can’t be entered unless CLK is low a t the falling edge of the /HOLD \nsignal. And /HOLD mode can’t be exited unless CLK is low at the  rising edge of the /HOLD signal. \nSee Figure.4 for HOLD condition waveform. \nIf /CS is driven high during a HO LD condition, it resets the in ternal logic of the device. As long as \n/HOLD signal is low, the memory remains in the HOLD condition. To re-work communication with \nthe device, /HOLD must go high, and /CS must go low .

The Read JEDEC ID instruction is co ngruous with the JEDEC standard \nfor SPI compatible serial flash memories that was adopted in 20 03. The instruction is entered by \ndriving the /CS pin low with following the instruction code “9F h”. JEDEC assigned Manufacturer ID \nbyte and two Device ID bytes, Memory Type (ID-15-ID8 and Capaci ty (ID7-ID0 are then shifted out \non the falling edge of CLK with mo st significant bit (MSB first  shown in figure 31. For memory type \nand capacity values refer to Manuf acturer and Device Identifica tion table. The JEDEC ID can be \nread continuously.

However, SPI mode and QPI mode canno t be used at the same time. \nEnable QPI instruction is the only way to switch the device fro m SPI mode to QPI mode. \n \nIn order to switch the device to QPI mode, the Quad Enable (QE bit in Status Register 2 must be \nset to 1 first, and an Enable QPI instruction must be issued. I f the Quad Enable (QE bit is 0, the \nEnable QPI instruction will be ig nored and the device will rema in in SPI mode. \nAfter power-up, the default stat e of the device is SPI mode. Se e the instruction Set Table 1-3 for all \nthe commands supported in SPI mode and the instruction Set Tabl e 4 for all the instructions \nsupported in QPI mode. \n \nWhen the device is switched from SPI mode to QPI mode, the exis ting Write Enable and \nProgram/Erase Suspend status, and the Wrap Length setting will remain unchanged. \n           \n \n \n9.33 Disable QPI (FFh \nBy issuing Disable QPI (FFh instruction, the device is reset SP I mode. When the device is \nswitched from QPI mode to SPI mode, the existing Write Enable L atch (WEL and Program/Erase \nSuspend status, and t he Wrap Length setting will remain unchang ed. \n \n         \n\nZD25Q64B\n 5 7 \n \n \n \n \n9.34 Word Read Quad I/O (E7h \nThe Quad I/O dramatically reduces instruction overhead allowing  faster random access for code \nexecution (XIP directly from the Quad SPI. The Quad Enable bit (QE of Status Register-2 must be \nset to enable the Word Read Quad I/O instruction. The lowest Ad dress bit (A0 must equal 0 and \nonly two dummy clocks are requi red prior to the data output. \n \nContinuous Read Mode \nThe Word Read Quad I/O instruction can further reduce instructi on overhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7-0 after the input Address bits (A23-0, as shown in Figure 34a. \nThe upper nibble of the (M7-4 c ontrols the length of the next W ord Read Quad I/O instruction \nthrough the inclusion or exclusion of the first byte instructio n code. The lower nibble bits of the \n(M[3:0] are don’t care (“X”. However, the IO pins should be hig h-impedance prior to the falling edge \nof the first data out clock. \n \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode” bits  M[7-4]= Ah, then the next Fa st Read Quad I/O instruction (after \n/CS is raised and then lowered does not require the E7h instruc tion code, as shown in Figure 34b. \nThis reduces the instruction sequence by eight clocks and allow s the Read address to be \nimmediately entered after /CS is asserted low. If the “Continuo us Read Mode” bits M[7:4] do not \nequal to Ah(1,0,1,0 the next instruction (after /CS is raised a nd then lowered requires the first byte \ninstruction code, thus returning to normal operation. \n \n         \n\uf020\nZD25Q64B\n 5 8 \n \n \n \n \nWrap Around in SPI mode \nThe Word Read Quad I/O instruction can also be used to access a  specific portion within a page \nby issuing a “Set Burst with Wrap”  (77h instruction prior to E7 h. The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h \ninstruction can either enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feat ure for the followi ng E7h commands. \nWhen “Wrap Around” is enabled, the output data starts at the in itial address specified in the \ninstruction, once it reaches t he ending boundary of the 8/16/32 /64-byte section, the output will \nwrap around to the beginning boundary automatically until /CS i s pulled high to terminate the \ninstruction. \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature a llows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address \nand then fill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/ 32/64-byte of data without issuing read \ninstructions. \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instr uction allows three “Wrap Bits”,  W6-4 to be set. The W4 bit is used \nto enable or disable the “Wrap Around” operation while W6-5 is used to specify the length of the \nwrap around section within a pag e. See 10.35 for detail descrip tions. \nZD25Q64B\n 5 9 \n \n \n \n \n9.35 Set Burst with Wrap (77h \nThe Set Burst with Wrap (77h instruction is used in conjunction  with “Fast Read Quad I/O” and \n“Word Read Quad I/O” instructions to access a fixed length of 8 /16/32/64-byte section within a \n256-byte page. Certain applications can benefit from this featu re and improve the overall system \ncode execution performance. Before the device will accept the S et Burst with Wrap instruction, a \nQuad enable of Status Register-2  must be executed (Status Regis ter bit QE must equal 1. \n \nThe Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low and then shifting the \ninstruction code “77h” followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap Bi ts”, W7-0. The instruction \nsequence is shown in Set Burst w ith Wrap Instruction Sequence.

To exit the “Wrap Around” function and return to normal read operation, another \nSet Burst with Wrap instruction should be issued to set W4 = 1.  The default value of W4 upon \npower on is 1. In the case of a system Reset while W4 = 0, it i s recommended that the controller \nissues a Set Burst with Wrap ins truction or Reset (99h instruct ion to reset W4 = 1 prior to any \nnormal Read instructions since ZD25Q64B does not have a hardwar e Reset Pin. \n \n        \n\nZD25Q64B\n 6 0 \n \n \n \n \n9.36 Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch \nThe “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch” instruction provides an alterna tive way to perform the read \noperation with “Wrap Around” in QP I mode.

The dummy \nclocks for various Fast Read instructions in Standard/Dual/Quad  SPI mode are fixed, please refer \nto the instruction. Table 10.2 - 10.5 for details. The “Wrap Le ngth” is set by W6-5 bit in the “Set \nBurst with Wrap (77h” instruction. This setting will remain unc hanged when the device is switched \nfrom Standard SPI mode to QPI mode. \n \nThe default “Wrap Length” after a  power up or a Reset instructi on is 8 bytes, the default number of \ndummy clocks is 4. \n \n \nP5, P4 Dummy \nClocks Maximum \nRead Freq.  \nP1, P0 \nWrap Length \n0 0 4 80MHz  0 0 8-byte \n0 1 4 80MHz  0 1 16-byte \n1 0 6 108MHz  1 0 32-byte \n1 1 8 133MHz  1 1 64-byte \n \n  \n            \n\nZD25Q64B\n 6 3 \n \n \n \n \n9.38 Enable Reset (66h and Reset (99h \nBecause of the small package and the limitation on the number o f pins, the ZD25Q64B provide a \nsoftware Reset instruction inst ead of a dedicated RESET pin. \n \nOnce the Reset instruction is accepted, any on-going internal o perations will be terminated and the \ndevice will return to its default power-on state and lose all t he current volatile settings, such as \nVolatile Status Register bits,  Write Enable Latch (WEL status, Program/Erase Suspend status, \nContinuous Read Mode bit setting, Read parameter setting and Wr ap bit setting. \n \n“Enable Reset (66h” and “Reset (99h” instructions can be issued  in either SPI mode or QPI mode. \nTo avoid accidental reset, both instructions must be issued in sequence. Any other instructions \nother than “Reset (99h” after the “Enable (66h” instruction wil l disable the “Reset Enable” state. A \nnew sequence of “Enable Reset (66h” and “Reset (99h” is needed to reset the device. Once the \nReset instruction is accepted by the device will take approxima tely tRST= 30us to reset. During  \nthis period, no instru ction will be accepted. \n \nData corruption may happen if there is an on-going or suspended  internal Erase or Program \noperation when Reset instruction sequence is accepted by device .
