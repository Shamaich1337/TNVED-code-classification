This device can be used in those \napplications which require high data throughput such as imaging device s and Multi-Channel FIFO  ADC or \nDAC devices et c.  \n \nThe FIFO interface can support multi -voltage I/O (1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V) and operating frequenc ies of \n66.67MHz or 100MHz. 100MHz only for 2.5V and 3.3V.  \n \nThere are 2 different proprietary synchronous  bus protocols supported; one FIFO bus protocol is called  \nthe “Multi-Channel FIFO ” bus protocol and the o ther is  the “245 Synchronous  FIFO” bus protocol.  The \nlatter being an extension of the interface introduced in the FT232H/FT2232H devices.   \n \n4.1 Key Features and Function Description  \nFunctional Integration  \nThe fo llowing features are integral to the IC design: FIFO protocol management, USB 3.0 controller, \nUSB3.0 and USB2.0 PHYs, GPIOs, power management, clock generation, power -on-reset (POR) and LDO \nregulator . \n \nUSB 3.0 Protocol Controller  \nThe USB 3.0 Protocol Controller manages the data stream from the device USB control en dpoint. It \nhandles the  USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the commands for \ncontrolling the functional parameters of the F IFO in accordance with the USB 3.0 specificati on. \n \nFIFO Management  \nThis unit  is used to manage all PIPE data or buffer s in the FIFO memory; the data is sent or received \nthrough  the FIFO protocol layer. Through this block the FIFO memory can be allocated to each PIPE with \nany size of memory as long as the total memory allocated to all PIPEs does not exceed the maximum \nFIFO memory size which is 16 KB. Additionally, the FIFO signals have a configurable high drive strength \ncapabili ty and can be set to 18Ω, 25Ω, 35Ω and 50Ω.  \n \nMulti -Channel FIFO Bus protocol  \nThe multi -Channel FIFO bus is a s lave bus and is designed to handle Multi-Channel FIFO  connectivity. The \nbus protocol supports a total of 8 channels (4 INs and 4 OUTs). CLK is the clock output to  the FIFO bus \nmaster.  \n \n245 Synchronous FIFO Bus protocol  \nThe 245 Synchronous FIFO bus is a slave bus with o ne IN and one OUT FIFO channel supported by this \nbus protocol. CLK is the clock output to the FIFO bus master.  \n \nFIFO Bus Clock Option  \nThe device provides  the following FIFO bus clock frequency option: 100MHz.  \n \nFIFO RX/TX Buffer (16k bytes)  \nData sent from the USB host controller to the FIFO via the USB data OUT endpoint is stored in the FIFO \nRX (receive) buffer and is removed from the buffer by reading the contents of the FIFO using the RD# \npin. ( RX relative to the USB  interface).  \n \nData written into the FIFO using the WR pin is stored in the FIFO TX (transmit) Buffer. The USB host \ncontroller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB request for d ata from the device data \nIN endpoint. (TX relative  to the USB  interface).  \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  12 \n FT600Q -FT601Q IC Datasheet   \nVersion  1.05 \n \nDocument No.: FT_001 118          Clearance No.: FTDI#424  \nWhen the FT600 or FT601 is configured as the 245 Synchronous FIFO bus or 1 channel in the multi -\nChannel FIFO bus mode, the FIFO buffer is configured as 4 KB * 2 (double buffered) ea ch on the RX and \nTX channel s. \n \nWhen the FT600 or FT601 is configured as 2 channels in the multi -Channel FIFO bus mode, the FIFO \nbuffer is configured as 2 KB * 2 (double buffered) each on RX and TX channel.  \n \nWhen the FT600 or FT601 is configured as 4 channe ls in the multi -Channel FIFO bus mode, the FIFO \nbuffer is configured as 1 KB * 2 (double buffered) each on RX and TX channel.  \n \nInternal LDO  Regulator  \nThe LDO regulator generates the + 1.0V power supply  for driving the internal core of the device. Not to be \nused for external devices.  \n \nReset Generator  \nThe integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power -on reset to the device internal c ircuitry at \npower up. The RESET_N  input pin allows an external device to reset the FT60x. Active low.  \n \nRemote Wake Up  Function   \nIf USB is in suspend mode, and remote wake up has been enabled, driving  the WAKEUP_N pin to low will \ncause the FT60x device  to request a resume from suspend on the USB bus. Normally this can be used to \nwake up the host PC from suspend.  \n \nBCD(Batt ery Charge Detection) Function  \nSupports Battery Charging spec revision  1.2, it is optional for mapping the GPIO pin to indicate the detect \nresults.  Refer to GPIO for the pin configuration in BCD mode .  \n \nGPIO  (General purpose input and output) pins  \nGPOI[1: 0] are multifunction al pins. The function s are configured by the chip configuration data. The \ndefault chip configuration sets the GPIO pin s as FIFO mode configuration  input. At the power up, FT600 \nor FT601 sets the chip to 245  synchronous FIFO mode  or multi-channel  FIFO mode s depend ing on the \nGPIO[1:0] input, details in the table below:  \n \nGPIO1  GPIO0  Chip mode  \n0 0 1 channel, 245 Synchronous FIFO mode  \n0 1 1 channel, Multi-Channel  FIFO mode  \n1 0 2 channel, Multi-Channel  FIFO mode  \n1 1 4 channel, Multi-Channe l FIFO mode  \n \nTo enable the GPIO function, the chip configuration must be updated to set the GPIO function.  \n \nTo enable the BCD mode, the chip configuration must be updated to set the BCD mode.  \n \nWhen the FT600 or FT601 is configured to support BCD, the GPIO  pins are set to output, output changes \naccording to BCD detection result.  \n \nGPIO1  GPIO0  Chip mode  \n0 0 No USB connection or BCD detection on going.  \n0 1 SDP(standard downstream port) detected  \n1 0 CDP(Charg ing downstream port) detected  \n1 1 DCP(Dedicated c harging port) detected  \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright © Future Technology Devices International Limited  13 \n FT600Q -FT601Q IC Datasheet   \nVersion  1.05 \n \nDocument No.: FT_001 118          Clearance No.: FTDI#424  \n \n4.2 Multi -Channel FIFO Mode Protocols  \nThis is a Slave bus and is designed to handle multi -channel connectivity. The bus protocol supports  a \ntotal of 4 bidirectional channels;  each has 1 USB OUT and 1 USB IN  endpoints. . CLK is the clock output  \nfrom the bus slave to the bus master.  \n \nThe channel number denoted in this document as channel 1 to 3 mapped to USB endpoint number 2 to 5. \nThe USB OUT endpoint in Channel 1 is denoted as USB out channel 1, USB IN endpoint in channel 1 is \ndenoted as USB IN channel 1.  \n \nCorrespondingly, the FIFO OUT is for data transmitted from USB host to device and FIFO IN is for data \ntransmitted from USB device to host.  \n \nWR_N is the bus master to bus slave data transaction request signal, and it is active  low.  \n \nRXF_N is the bus slave to bus master data receive acknowledge signal, and it is active  low.  \n \nTXE_N  (optional signal , master can ignore this signal ) is the bus slave to bus master FIFO idle status \nvalid signal, and it is low active.  \n \nDATA [31:0] is used  as the 32-bit data bus during the data transfer phase. When the bus is in the idle \nstate DATA[31:16], DATA[7:0] and BE [3:0] are driven to logic”1” b y the bus master, and DATA [15:8] is \ndriven by the bus slave to provide  the FIFO status to the bus master . The upper nibble (DATA [15:12]) \nprovide s the 4 OUT channels FIFO s tatus while the lower nibble (DATA [11:8]) provide s the 4 IN channels \nFIFO status. They are all active  low.  \n \nFor example, at idle , DATA[12] is logic”0” and DATA [8] is logic”0”, which indicates  USB OUT channel 1 \nFIFO data is available to send and USB IN channel 1 FIFO space is empty to receive data respectively. \nThe external b us master will start a transfer cycle by asserting WR_N  based on the channel FIFO status . \nThe first cycle after WR_N is asserted is the command phase, follow ed by the data phase when RXF_N is \nasserted. At the command phase, the bus master will send the channel number which it intends to \ntransfer data with  on DATA [7:0] and the Read/Write command on BE[3:0] .
