B | Page 9 of 12 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe HMC232A  operates using complementary negative control \nvoltage logic lines and requires no bias supply. The two logic \ncontrol input  pins (A and B ) control the state of the RF paths, \ndetermining which RF x port is in the insertion loss state and \nwhich  path is in the is olation state (see Table 6). \nRF INPUT AND OUTPUT  \nAll of the RFx ports (RFC, RF1, and RF2) are dc -coupled to 0 V , \nand no dc blocking capacitors are required at the RFx ports when  \nthe RF potential is equal to 0 V .  \nThe RFx ports are internally matched to 50 Ω . Therefore,  \nexternal matching networks are not required.  \nThe HMC232A  is bidirectional , therefore, a n RF input signal \n(RF IN) can be applied to the RFC port or to the RF1  port  or the \nRF2 port.  The insertion loss path conducts the RF signal between the \nselected RF throw port and the RF common port. The isolation path provide s high loss between the insertion loss path and the \nunselected RF throw port, which is nonreflective , by using an \ninternal 50 Ω termination resistor.   \nPOWER SUPPLY \nThe HMC232A  requires negative voltage applied to the logic \ncontrol input  pins (A and B ). Bypassing capacitors are \nrecommended  on the supply lines to filter high frequency noise.  \nThe ideal power -up sequence follows:  \n1. Conne ct to GND . \n2. Power up the digital control inputs. The  relative  order  of \nthe digital control inputs is not important.  \n3. Apply an RF input signal to RFC , RF1, or RF2.  \nThe ideal power -down sequence is the reverse order of the \npower -up sequence.  \nTable 6.

B | Page 10 of 12 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nLAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS  \nAll meas urements in this data sheet are measured on the \nEV1HMC232ALP4  evaluation board. The design of this \nevaluation board can serve as a layout recommendation for \napplication s.  \nBOARD LAYOUT  \nThe HMC232A  is a 4 -layer board. The outer copper (Cu) layers \nare 0.7 mil plated and are separated by dielectric materials. Figure 19 shows the HMC232A  board stack  up. \n \nFigure 19. HMC232A  Stack  Up \nAll RF and dc traces are routed on the top copper layer, and the inner and bottom layers are ground planes that provide a \nsolid ground for the RF transmission lines. The top dielectric material (H) is 10 mil Rogers R O4350, which allows optimal RF \nperformance. The middle and bottom dielectric layers provide mechanical strength. The overall board thickness is ~62  mil, \nwhich allows Subminiature Version A (SMA) connectors to be connected at the board edges.  \n \n RF AND DIGITAL CONTROLS  \nThe RF transmission lines are designed using a coplanar waveguide  \n(CPWG) model with a width of 1 6 mil and a ground spacing \n(G) of 13 mil and have a characteristic impedance of 50  Ω. For \noptimal RF and thermal grounding, as many plated through \nvias as possible are arranged around the transmission lines and under the exposed pad of the package.  \nFigure 20 shows the top view of the popula ted EV1HMC232ALP4 , \nwhich is available from Analog Devices upon request (see the \nOrdering Guide ). \n \nFigure 20. Populated EV1HMC232ALP4 —Top View  \nThe RF input and output ports (RFC, RF1, and RF2) are connected \nthrough 50 Ω transmission lines to the SMA launchers. On the \ntraces of the logic control input  pins (A and B ), a 100 pF bypass \ncapacitor was used to filter high frequenc y noise.  Figure 21 \nshows the suggested driver circuit.  \nFigure 22 and Table 7 show the typical application circuit and \nbill of materials for the HMC232A , respectively . \n \n \nFigure 21.
