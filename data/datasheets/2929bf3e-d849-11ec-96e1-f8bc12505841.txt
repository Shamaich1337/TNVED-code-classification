General Description  \nOPQE01  is a parallel 100Gb/s Quad Small Form -factor Pluggable (QSFP28) optical module. It \nprovides increased port density and total system cost savings. The QSFP28 full -duplex optical \nmodule offers 4 independent transmit and receive channels, each capable of 25Gb/s operation for an \naggregate data rate of 100Gb/s on 100 meters of OM4 multi -mode fiber.  \nAn optical fiber ribbon cable with an MTP/MPO connector can be plugged into the QSFP28 module \nreceptacle. Proper alignment is ensured by the guide pins inside the receptacle. The cable usually \ncannot be twisted for proper channel to channel alignment. Electrical connection is achieved through \nan MSA -compliant 38-pin edge type connector.  \nThe module operates by a single +3.3V power supply. LVCMOS/LVTTL global control signals, such \nas Module Present, Reset, Interrupt and Low Power Mode, are available with the modules. A 2 -wire \nserial interface is available to send and  receive more complex control signals, and to receive digital \ndiagnostic information. Individual channels can be addressed and unused channels can be shut down \nfor maximum design flexibility.  \nThe product is designed with form factor, optical/electrical con nection and digital diagnostic \ninterface according to the QSFP28 Multi -Source Agreement (MSA). It has been designed to meet the \nharshest external operating conditions including temperature, humidity and EMI interference. The \nmodule offers very high functio nality and feature integration, accessible via a two -wire serial \ninterface.  \n \n \n\n100G QSFP28 SR4 Optical Transceiver (OPQE01)  \nHot Pluggable  ,MPO/MTP,  +3.3V , VCSEL& PIN, Multi mode  \n \nShenzhen  Opway Communication Co., Ltd.  \n3F, Building 5, Section 2, Baiwangxin High -tech Industrial Park,1002 Songbai Rd.,  \nNanshan, Shenzhen ,Guangdong,China 518000  \nTel: +86 -755-86000306        Fax: +86-755-86000825  \nE-mail: info@opwaytech.com   http://www.opwaytech.com  Page 2 of 9 2. Functional Description  \nThis product converts parallel electrical input signals into parallel optical signals, by a driven Vertical \nCavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) array.  The transmitter module accepts electrical input \nsignals compatible with Common Mode Logic (CML) levels. All input data signals are differential \nand internally terminated. The receiver module converts parallel optical input signals via a photo \ndetector arr ay into parallel electrical output signals. The receiver module outputs electrical signals \nare also voltage compatible with Common Mode Logic (CML) levels. All data signals are differential \nand support a data rates up to 25Gb/s per channel. Figure 1 shows the functional block diagram of \nthis product.  \nA single +3.3V power supply is required to power up the module. Both power supply pins VccTx \nand VccRx are internally connected and should be applied concurrently. As per MSA specifications \nthe module offers 7 low speed hardware control pins (including the 2 -wire serial interface): ModSelL, \nSCL, SDA, ResetL, LPMode, ModPrsL and IntL.  \nModule Select (ModSelL) is an input pin. When held low by the host, the module responds to 2 -wire \nserial communication commands. The ModSelL allows the use of multiple QSFP28 modules on a \nsingle 2 -wire interface bus – individual ModSelL lines for each QSFP28 module must be used.  \nSerial Clock (SCL) and Serial Data (SDA) are required for the 2 -wire serial bus communication \ninterface a nd enable the host to access the QSFP28 memory map.  \nThe ResetL pin enables a complete module reset, returning module settings to their default state, \nwhen a low level on the ResetL pin is held for longer than the minimum pulse length. During the \nexecution of a reset the host shall disregard all status bits until the module indicates a completion of \nthe reset interrupt. The module indicates this by posting an IntL (Interrupt) signal with the \nData_Not_Ready bit negated in the memory map. Note that on power up  (including hot insertion) the \nmodule should post this completion of reset interrupt without requiring a reset.  \nLow Power Mode (LPMode) pin is used to set the maximum power consumption for the module in \norder  to protect hosts that are not capable of cooling higher power modules, should such modules be \naccidentally inserted.  \nModule Present (ModPrsL) is a signal local to the host board which, in the absence of a module, is \nnormally pulled up to the host Vcc. When a module is inserted into the connector,  it completes the \npath to ground through a resistor on the host board and asserts the signal. ModPrsL then indicates a \nmodule is present by setting ModPrsL to a “Low” state.  \nInterrupt (IntL) is an output pin. Low indicates a possible module operational fau lt or a status critical \nto the host system. The host identifies the source of the interrupt using the 2 -wire serial interface. \nThe IntL pin is an open collector output and must be pulled to the Host Vcc voltage on the Host \nboard.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n100G QSFP28 SR4 Optical Transceiver (OPQE01)  \nHot Pluggable  ,MPO/MTP,  +3.3V , VCSEL& PIN, Multi mode  \n \nShenzhen  Opway Communication Co., Ltd.  \n3F, Building 5, Section 2, Baiwangxin High -tech Industrial Park,1002 Songbai Rd.,  \nNanshan, Shenzhen ,Guangdong,China 518000  \nTel: +86 -755-86000306        Fax: +86-755-86000825  \nE-mail: info@opwaytech.com   http://www.opwaytech.com  Page 3 of 9 3.
