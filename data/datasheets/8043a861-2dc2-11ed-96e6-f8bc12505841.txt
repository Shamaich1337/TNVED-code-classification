It uses 25MHz crystal or CMOS reference as an input to generate the 100MHz low power differential HCSL outputs with on-chip terminations.  \nThe on-chip termination can save 16 external resistors and make layout easier. An additional buffered reference output is provided to serve as a low noise reference for other circuitry. \nIt uses Diodes proprietary PLL design to achieve very low jitter  \nthat meets PCIe Gen1/Gen2/Gen3/Gen4 requirements. It also provides various options such as different slew rate and ampli -\ntude through strapping pins or SMBUS so that users can config -\nure the device easily to get the optimized performance for their individual boards. The device also supports selectable spread-spectrum options to reduce EMI for various applications.\n2\nPI6CG18401A Product Line of\nDiodes Incorporatedwww.diodes.com  January 2022\n Diodes IncorporatedPI6CG18401  \nDocument Number DS39948 Rev 3-2  Pin # Pin Name Type Description\n1 GND_XTAL Power Ground for oscillator circuit\n2 XTAL_IN/CLK Input Crystal input or CMOS reference input\n3 XTAL_OUT Output Crystal output\n4 VDD_OSC Power Power supply for oscillator circuitry, nominal 1.8V\n5 VDD_REFOUT Power Power supply for buffered CMOS output\n6 SADR/REFOUTInput/\nOutputCMOSLatch to select SMBus Address or 1.8V LVCMOS REFOUT.
