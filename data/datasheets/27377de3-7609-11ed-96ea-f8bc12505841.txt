The number of configuration bits is between 3 Mb and 33 Mb depending on device size and user -design implementation options. The configuration storage \nis volatile and must be reloa ded whenever the FPGA is powered up. This stor age can also be reloaded at any time by pulling \nthe PROGRAM_B pin Low. Several methods and data formats for loading configuration are available.\nBit-serial configurations can be either master serial mode, where the FPGA generates the configuration clock (CCLK) signal, \nor slave serial mode, where the external configuration data source also clocks the FPGA. For byte-wide configurations, master SelectMAP mode generates the CCLK signal while slave SelectMAP mode receives the CCLK signal for the 8- and 16-bit-wide transfer. In master serial mode, the beginning of the bitstream can optionally switch the clocking source to an external clock, which can be faster or more precise than the internal clock. The available JTAG pins use boundary-scan \nprotocols to load bit-serial configuration data.Table  2: Spartan-6 Device-Package Combinations and Maximum Available I/Os\nPackage CPG196(1)TQG144(1)CSG225(2)FT(G)256(3)CSG324 FG(G)484(3,4)CSG484(4)FG(G)676(3)FG(G)900(3)\nBody Size \n(mm)8x8 2 0x2 0 1 3x1 3 1 7x1 7 1 5x1 5 2 3x2 3 1 9x1 9 2 7x2 7 3 1x3 1\nPitch (mm) 0.5 0.5 0.8 1.0 0.8 1.0 0.8 1.0 1.0\nDevice User I/O User I/O User I/O User I/O GTPsUser \nI/OGTPsUser \nI/OGTPsUser \nI/OGTPsUser \nI/OGTPsUser \nI/O\nXC6SLX4 106 102 132\nXC6SLX9 106 102 160 186 NA 200\nXC6SLX16 106 160 186 NA 232\nXC6SLX25 186 NA 226 NA 266\nXC6SLX45 NA 218 NA 316 NA 320 NA 358\nXC6SLX75 NA 280 NA 328 NA 408\nXC6SLX100 NA 326 NA 338 NA 480\nXC6SLX150 NA 338 NA 338 NA 498 NA 576\nXC6SLX25T 2 190 2 250\nXC6SLX45T 4 190 4 296 4 296\nXC6SLX75T 4 268 4 292 8 348\nXC6SLX100T 4 296 4 296 8 376 8 498\nXC6SLX150T 4 296 4 296 8 396 8 540\nNotes: \n1. There is no memory controller on the devices in these packages.\n2. Memory controller block support is x8 on the XC6SLX9 and XC6S LX16 devices in the CSG225 package. There is no memory controlle r in the \nXC6SLX4.\n3. These devices are available in both Pb and Pb-free (additional G) packages as standard ordering options.\n4. These packages support two of the four memory controllers in  the XC6SLX75, XC6SLX75T, XC6SLX100, XC6SLX100T, XC6SLX150, and \nXC6SLX150T devices.\nSpartan-6 Family Overview\nDS160 (v2.0) October 25, 2011 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 4The bitstream configuration information is generated by the ISE® software using a program called BitGen. The configuration \nprocess typically executes the following sequence:\n\x81 Detects power-up (power-on reset) or PROGRAM_B when Low.\n\x81 Clears the whole configuration memory.\x81 Samples the mode pins to determine the configuration mode: master or slave, bit-serial or parallel.\n\x81 Loads the configuration data starting with the bus-width detection pattern followed by a synchronization word, checks \nfor the proper device code, and ends with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of the complete bitstream.\n\x81S t a r t s  a user-defined sequence of events: releasing the internal reset (or preset) of flip-flops, optionally waiting for the \nDCMs and/or PLLs to lock, activating the output drivers, and transitioning the DONE pin to High.\nThe Master Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and the Master Byte-wide Peripheral Interface (BPI) are two common methods \nused for configuring the FPGA. The Spartan-6 FPGA configures it self from a directly attached industry-standard SPI serial \nflash PROM. The Spartan-6 FPGA can configure itself via BPI when connected to an industry-standard parallel NOR flash. \nNote that BPI configuration is not supported in the XC6SLX 4, XC6SLX25, and XC6SLX25T nor is BPI available when using \nSpartan-6 FPGAs in TQG144 and CPG196 packages.\nSpartan-6 FPGAs support MultiBoot configuration, where two or  more FPGA configuration bitstreams can be stored in a \nsingle configuration source. The FPGA application controls which configuration to load next and when to load it.\nSpartan-6 FPGAs also include a unique, factory-programmed Device  DNA identifier that is useful for tracking purposes, anti-\ncloning designs, or IP protec tion. In the largest devices, bitstreams can be copy protected using AES encryption.\nReadback\nMost configuration data can be read back without affecting the system’s operation.\nCLBs, Slices, and LUTs\nEach configurable logic block (CLB) in Spartan-6 FPGAs consists of two slices, arranged side-by-side as part of two vertical \ncolumns. There are three types of CLB slices in the Spartan-6 architecture: SLICEM, SLICEL, and SLICEX. Each slice contains four LUTs, eight flip-flops, and miscellaneous logic. The LUTs are for general-purpose combinatorial and sequential logic support. Synthesis tools take advantage of th ese highly efficient logic, arithmetic, and memory features. \nExpert designers can also instantiate them.\nSLICEM\nOne quarter (25%) of Spartan-6 FPGA slices are SLICEMs. Each  of the four SLICEM LUTs can be configured as either a \n6-input LUT with one output, or as dual 5-input LUTs with identical 5-bit addresses and two independent outputs. These \nLUTs can also be used as distributed 64-bit RAM with 64 bits or two times 32 bits per LUT, as a single 32-bit shift register \n(SRL32), or as two 16-bit shift registers (SRL16s) with addressable length. Each LUT output can be registered in a flip-flop within the CLB. For arithmetic operations, a high-speed carry chain propagates carry signals upwards in a column of slices.\nSLICEL\nOne quarter (25%) of Spartan-6 FPGA slices are SLICELs, which contain all the features of the SLICEM except the \nmemory/shift register function.\nSLICEX\nOne half (50%) of Spartan-6 FPGA slices are SLICEXs. The SLICEXs have the same structure as SLICELs except the \narithmetic carry option and the wide multiplexers.\nSpartan-6 Family Overview\nDS160 (v2.0) October 25, 2011 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 5Clock Management\nEach Spartan-6 FPGA has up to six CMTs, each consisting of  two DCMs and one PLL, which can be used individually or \ncascaded.\nDCM\nThe DCM provides four phases of the input frequency (CLKIN):  shifted 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° (CLK0, CLK90, CLK180, and \nCLK270). It also provides a doubled frequency CLK2X and its complement CLK2X180. The CLKDV output provides a fractional clock frequency that can be phase-aligned to CLK0. The fraction is programmable as every integer from 2 to 16, as well as 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 . . . 7.5. CLKIN can optionally be divide d by 2. The DCM can be a zero-delay clock buffer when a clock  \nsignal drives CLKIN, while the CLK0 output is fed back to the CLKFB input.\nFrequency Synthesis\nIndependent of the basic DCM functionality, the frequency synthesis outputs CLKFX and CLKFX180 can be programmed to generate any output frequency that is the DCM input frequency (F\nIN) multiplied by M and simultaneously divided by D, where \nM can be any integer from 2 to 32 and D can be any integer from 1 to 32.\nPhase Shifting\nWith CLK0 connected to CLKFB, all nine CLK outputs (CLK0, CLK90, CLK180, CLK270, CLK2X, CLK2X180, CLKDV, CLKFX, and CLKFX180) can be shifted by a common amount, defined as any integer multiple of a fixed delay. A fixed DCM delay value (fraction of the input period) can be established by configuration and can also be incremented or decremented dynamically.\nSpread-Spectrum Clocking\nThe DCM can accept and track typical spread-spectrum clock inpu ts, provided they abide by the input clock specifications \nlisted in the Spartan-6 FPGA Data Sheet: DC and Switching Characteristics . Spartan-6 FPGAs can generate a spread-\nspectrum clock source from a st andard fixed-freq uency oscillator.\nPLL\nThe PLL can serve as a frequency synthesizer for a wider range of  frequencies and as a jitter filter for incoming clocks in \nconjunction with the DCMs. The heart of the PLL is a volt age-controlled oscillator (VCO) with a frequency range of \n400 MHz to 1,080 MHz, thus spanning more than one octave. Three sets of programmable frequency dividers (D, M, and O) adapt the VCO to the required application.\nThe pre-divider D (programmable by configuration) reduces th e input frequency and feeds one input of the traditional PLL \nphase comparator. The feedback divider (programmable by configuration) acts as a multiplier because it divides the VCO output frequency before feeding the other input of the phase comparator. D and M must be chosen appropriately to keep the VCO within its controllable frequency range.\nThe VCO has eight equally spaced outputs (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°). Each can be selected to drive \none of the six output dividers, O0 to O5 (each programmable by configuration to divide by any integer from 1 to 128).\nClock Distribution\nEach Spartan-6 FPGA provides abundant clock lines to address the different clocking requirements of high fanout, short \npropagation delay, and extremely low skew.\nGlobal Clock Lines\nIn each Spartan-6 FPGA, 16 global-clock lines have the highest fa nout and can reach every flip-flop clock. Global clock lines \nmust be driven by global clock buffers, which can also perform glitchless clock multiplexing and the clock enable function. Global clocks are often driven from the CMTs, which can completely eliminate the basic clock distribution delay.\nI/O Clocks\nI/O clocks are especially fast and serve only the localized input and output delay circuits and the I/O serializer/deserializer  \n(SERDES) circuits, as described in the I/O Logic  section.\nSpartan-6 Family Overview\nDS160 (v2.0) October 25, 2011 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 6Block RAM\nEvery Spartan-6 FPGA has between 12 and 268 dual-port block RAMs, each storing 18 Kb. Each block RAM has two \ncompletely independent ports that share only the stored data.\nSynchronous Operation\nEach memory access, whether read or write, is controlled by the clock. All inputs, data, address, clock enables, and write enables are registered. The data output is always latched, retaining data until the next operation. An optional output data pipeline register allows higher clock rates at the cost of an extra cycle of latency.\nDuring a write operation in dual-port mode, the data output can reflect either the previously stored data, the newly written \ndata, or remain unchanged.\nProgrammable Data Width\n\x81 Each port can be configured as 16K × 1, 8K × 2, 4K × 4, 2K × 9 (or 8), 1K × 18 (or 16), or 512 x 36 (or 32).\n\x81 The x9, x18, and x36 configurations include parity bits. The two ports can have different aspect ratios.\x81 Each block RAM can be divided into two completely independent 9 Kb block RAMs that can each be configured to any \naspect ratio from 8K x 1 to 512 x 18, with 256 x 36 supported in simple dual-port mode.\nMemory Controller Block\nMost Spartan-6 devices include dedicated memory controller blocks (MCBs), each targeting a single-chip DRAM (either DDR, DDR2, DDR3, or LPDDR), and supporting access rates of up to 800 Mb/s.\nThe MCB has dedicated routing to predefined FPGA I/Os. If the MCB is not used, these I/Os are available as general \npurpose FPGA I/Os. The memory controller offers a complete multi-port arbitrated interface to the logic inside the Spartan-6 FPGA. Commands can be pushed, and data can be pushed to and pulled from independent built-in FIFOs, using conventional FIFO control signals. The multi-port memory controller can be configured in many ways. An internal 32-, 64-, or 128-bit data interface provides a simple and reliable interface to the MCB.\nThe MCB can be connected to 4-, 8-, or 16-bit external DRAM. The MCB, in many applications, provides a faster DRAM \ninterface compared to traditional internal data buses, which are wider and are clocked at a lower frequency. The FPGA logic interface can be flexibly configured irrespective of the physical  memory device. The MCB functionality is not supported in the \n-3N speed grade.\nDigital Signal Processing—DSP48A1 Slice\nDSP applications use many binary multipliers and accumu lators, best implemented in dedicated DSP slices. All \nSpartan-6 FPGAs have many dedicated, full-custom, low-powe r DSP slices, combining high speed with small size, while \nretaining system design flexibility.\nEach DSP48A1 slice consists of a dedicated 18 × 18 bit two\'s co mplement multiplier and a 48-bit accumulator, both capable \nof operating at up to 390 MHz. The DSP48A1 slice provides extensive pipelining and extens ion capabilities that enhance \nspeed and efficiency of many applications, even beyond digita l signal processing, such as wide dynamic bus shifters, \nmemory address generators, wide bus multiplexers, and memory-mapped I/O register files. The accumulator can also be used as a synchronous up/down counter. The multiplier can perform barrel shifting.\nSpartan-6 Family Overview\nDS160 (v2.0) October 25, 2011 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 7Input/Output\nThe number of I/O pins varies from 102 to 576, depending on device and package size. Each I/O pin is configurable and can \ncomply with a large number of standards, using up to 3.3V. The Spartan-6 FPGA SelectIO Resources User Guide describes \nthe I/O compatibilities of the various I/O options. With the exception of su pply pins and a few dedic ated configuration pins, \nall other package pins have the same I/O c apabilities, constrained only by certain banking rules. A ll user I/O is bidirectional ; \nthere are no input-only pins.\nAll I/O pins are organized in banks, with four banks on the smaller devices and six banks on the larger devices. Each bank \nhas several common VCCO output supply-voltage pins, which also powers certain input buffers. Some single-ended input \nbuffers require an externally applied reference voltage (VREF). There are several dual-purpose VREF-I/O pins in each bank. \nIn a given bank, when I/O standard calls for a VREF voltage, each VREF pin in that bank must be connected to the same \nvoltage rail and can not be used as an I/O pin.\nI/O Electrical Characteristics\nSingle-ended outputs use a conventional CMOS push/pull output structure, driving High towards VCCO or Low towards \nground, and can be put into high-Z state. Many I/O features are available to the system designer to optionally invoke in each I/O in their design, such as weak internal pull-up and pull-down resistors, strong internal split-termination input resistors, adjustable output drive-strengths and slew-rates, and differential termination resistors. See the Spartan-6 FPGA SelectIO \nResources User Guide  for more details on available options for each I/O standard.\nI/O Logic\nInput and Output Delay\nThis section describes the available logic resources connected to the I/O interfaces. All inputs and outputs can be configured \nas either combinatorial or regist ered. Double data ra te (DDR) is supported by all inputs and outputs. Any input or output can \nbe individually delayed by up to 256 increments (except in the -1L speed grade). This is implemented as IODELAY2. The \nidentical delay value is available either for data input or output. For a bidirectional data line, the transfer from input to o utput \ndelay is automatic. The number of delay steps can be set by configuration and can also be incremented or decremented while in use. \nBecause these tap delays vary with supply voltage, process, and temperature, an optional calibration mechanism is built into \neach IODELAY2: \n\x81 For source synchronous designs where more accuracy is required, the calibration mechanism can (optionally) \ndetermine dynamically how many taps are needed to delay data by one full I/O clock cycle, and then programs the IODELAY2 with 50% of that value, thus centering the I/O clock in the middle of the data eye.\n\x81 A special mode is available only for differential inputs, which uses a phase-detector me chanism to determine whether \nthe incoming data signal is being accurately sampled in the middle of the eye. The results from the phase-detector logic can be used to either increment or decrement the input delay, one tap at a time, to ensure error-free operation at very high bit rates.\nISERDES and OSERDES\nMany applications combine high-speed bit-serial I/O with slower parallel operation inside the device. This requires a serializer and deserializer (SerDes) inside the I/O structure. Ea ch input has access to its own deserializer (serial-to-paralle l \nconverter) with programmable parallel width of 2, 3, or 4 bits. Where differential inputs are used, the two serializers can be cascaded to provide parallel widths of 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits. Each output has access to its own serializer (parallel-to-serial converter) with programmable parallel width of 2, 3, or 4 bits. Two serializers can be cascaded when a differential driver is used to give access to bus widths of 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits.\nWhen distributing a double data rate clock, all SerDes data is actually clocked in/out at single data rate to eliminate the \npossibility of bit errors due to duty cycl e distortion. This faster single data rate  clock is either derived via frequency \nmultiplication in a PLL, or doubled locally in each IOB by differentiating both clock edges when the incoming clock uses double data rate.\nSpartan-6 Family Overview\nDS160 (v2.0) October 25, 2011 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 8Low-Power Gigabit Transceiver\nUltra-fast data transmission between ICs, over the backplane, or over longer distances is becoming increasingly popular and \nimportant. It requires specialized dedicated on-chip circuitry and differential I/O capable of coping with the signal integrity  \nissues at these high data rates.\nAll Spartan-6 LXT devices have 2–8 gigabit transceiver circuits. Each GTP transceiver is a combined transmitter and \nreceiver capable of operating at data rates up to 3.2 Gb/s. The transmitter and receiver are independent circuits that use separate PLLs to multiply the reference frequency input by certain programmable numbers between 2 and 25, to become the bit-serial data clock. Each GTP transceiver has a large number of user-definable features and parameters. All of these can be defined during device configuration, and many can also be modified during operation.\nTransmitter\nThe transmitter is fundamentally a parallel-to-serial converter with a conversion ratio of 8, 10, 16, or 20. The transmitter output drives the PC board with a single-channel differential current-mode logic (CML) output signal.\nTXOUTCLK is the appropriately divided serial data clock and can be used directly to register the parallel data coming from \nthe internal logic. The incoming parallel data is fed through a small FIFO and can optionally be modified with the 8B/10B algorithm to guarantee a sufficient number of transitions. The bit-serial output signal drives two package pins with complementary CML signals. This output signal pair has programmable signal swing as well as programmable pre-emphasis to compensate for PC board losses and other interconnect characteristics.\nReceiver\nThe receiver is fundamentally a serial-to-parallel converter, changing the incoming bit serial differential signal into a paral lel \nstream of words, each 8, 10, 16, or 20 bits wide. The receiver takes the incoming differential data stream, feeds it through a programmable equalizer (to compensate for the PC board and other interconnect charac teristics), and uses the F\nREF input \nto initiate clock recognition. There is no need for a separate clock line. The data pattern uses non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding and optionally guarantees suffic ient data transitions by using the 8B/10B  encoding scheme. Parallel data is then \ntransferred into the FPGA logic using the RXUSRCLK clock. The serial-to-parallel conversion ratio can be 8, 10, 16, or 20.\nIntegrated Endpoint Block for PCI Express Designs\nThe PCI Express standard is a packet-based, point-to-point serial interface standard. The differential signal transmission uses an embedded clock, which eliminates the clock-to-data skew problems of traditional wide parallel buses. \nThe PCI Express Base Specification 1.1 defines bit rate of 2.5 Gb/s per lane, per direction (transmit and receive). When \nusing 8B/10B encoding, this supports a data rate of 2.0 Gb/s per lane.\nThe Spartan-6 LXT devices include one integrated Endpoint block for PCI Express technology that is compliant with the PCI \nExpress Base Specification Revi sion 1.1. This block is highly configurable to  system design requirements and operates as \na compliant single lane Endpoint. The integrated Endpoint block interfaces to the GTP transceivers for serialization/de-serialization, and to block RAMs for data buffering. Combined, these elements implement the physical layer, data link layer, and transaction layer of the protocol.\nXilinx provides a light-wei ght (<200 LUT), configurable, easy- to-use LogiCORE™ IP that ties the various building blocks (the \nintegrated Endpoint block for PCI Express technology, the GTP transceivers, block RAM, and clocking resources) into a compliant Endpoint solution. The system designer has control over many configurable parameters: maximum payload size, reference clock frequency, and base address register decoding and filtering.\nMore information and documentation on soluti ons for PCI Express designs can be found at:\nhttp://www.xilinx.com /technology/protoco ls/pciexpress.htm\nSpartan-6 Family Overview\nDS160 (v2.0) October 25, 2011 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 9Spartan-6  FPGA Ordering Information\nTable 3  shows the speed and temperature grades available in the different Spartan-6 devices.
