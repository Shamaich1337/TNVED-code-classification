Temperatures quoted in relation to wave\nsoldering refer to the pin, not the housing.\n■If the components are to be washed varnished it is necessary to check whether the washing\nvarnish agent that is used has a negative effect on the wire insulation, any plastics that are used,\nor on glued joints. In particular, it is possible for washing varnish agent residues to have a\nnegative effect in the long-term on wire insulation.\nWashing processes may damage the product due to the possible static or cyclic mechanical\nloads (e.g. ultrasonic cleaning). They may cause cracks to develop on the product and its parts,\nwhich might lead to reduced reliability or lifetime.  \n■The following points must be observed if the components are potted in customer applications: \n– Many potting materials shrink as they harden. They therefore exert a pressure on the plastic\nhousing or core. This pressure can have a deleterious effect on electrical properties, and in\nextreme cases can damage the core or plastic housing mechanically.\n– It is necessary to check whether the potting material used attacks or destroys the wire\ninsulation, plastics or glue.\n– The effect of the potting material can change the high-frequency behaviour of the components.\n■Ferrites are sensitive to direct impact. This can cause the core material to flake, or lead to\nbreakage of the core.\n■Even for customer-specific products, conclusive validation of the component in the circuit can\nonly be carried out by the customer.\nPlease read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\n806/12\nImportant notes \nThe following applies to all products named in this publication : \n1.\nSome parts of this publication contain statements about the s uitability of our products for certain ar eas\nof \napplication.

In customer applications requiring a very high level of operat ional safety\nand especially in customer applications in which the malfunctio n or failure of an electronic component coul d\nenda\nnger human life or health (e.g.  in accident prevention or l ife-saving systems), it must therefore be\nensured by means of suitable des ign of the customer application  or other action taken by the customer (e.g.\ninstallation of protective circu itry or redundancy) that no inj ury or damage is sustained by third parties in th e\nevent of malfunctio\nn or failure of an electronic compo nent.\n3.The \nwarnings, cautions and produc t-specific notes must be obser ved.\n4.\nIn order to satisfy certain technical requirements, some of the products described in this publicat ion\nma\ny contain substances subject to restrictions in certain juris dictions (e.g. because they are\nclassed as hazardous) .
