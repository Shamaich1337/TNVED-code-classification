It is designed to supply positive or neg- \native bias voltages up to ±28V from input voltages in the \n0.8V to V OUT range and can be configured for boost, \nflyback, and SEPIC topologies.\nThe MAX629’s current-limited pulse-frequency-modula- \ntion (PFM) control scheme provides high efficiency over a \nwide range of load conditions. An internal, 0.5A N-channel \nMOSFET switch reduces the total part count, and a \nhigh switching frequency (up to 300kHz) allows for tiny \nsurface-mount magnetics.\nThe MAX629’s combination of low supply current, logic -\ncontrolled shutdown, small package, and tiny external \ncomponents makes it an extremely compact and efficient \nhigh-voltage biasing solution that’s ideal for battery-pow -\nered applications.

It is designed \nprimarily for use in low-power, high-voltage applications \nsuch as LCD biasing and set-top box varactor tuning. The \nMAX629’s unique control scheme provides high efficiency \nand a wide range of output voltages with only 80μA qui -\nescent supply current, making it ideal for battery-powered \napplications. The internal N-channel DMOS switch has \na pin-programmable current limit (250mA and 500mA), \nallowing optimization of output current and component \nsize. Figure 1  shows the MAX629 functional diagram.\nControl Scheme\nA combination of peak-current limiting and a pair of one-\nshots controls the MAX629 switching, determining the \nmaximum on-time and constant off-time. During the on-\ncycle, the internal switch closes, and current through the \ninductor ramps up until either the fixed 10μs maximum \non-time expires (at low input voltages) or the switch’s \npeak current limit is reached. The peak switch current \nlimit is selectable to either 500mA (ISET = V CC) or 250mA \n(ISET = GND) (see Setting the Current Limit ). After the \non-cycle terminates, the switch turns off, charging the out -\nput capacitor through the diode. In normal operation, the \nminimum off-time is set to 1μs for positive output voltages \nand 3.5μs for negative output voltages. When the output \nis well below regulation, however, the off-time is increased to 5μs to provide soft-start during start-up. The switching \nfrequency, which depends upon the load, can be as high \nas 300kHz.\nShutdown Mode\nWhen SHDN  is low, the MAX629 enters shutdown mode. \nIn this mode, the feedback and control circuit, reference, \nand internal biasing circuitry turn off. The shutdown cur -\nrent drops to less than 1μA. SHDN  is a logic-level input; \nconnect it to V CC for normal operation.\nThe output voltage behavior in shutdown mode depends \non the output voltage polarity. In the positive output \nvoltage configuration (Figure 2), the output is directly \nconnected to the input through the diode (D1) and the \ninductor (L1). When the device is in shutdown mode, the \noutput voltage falls to one diode drop below the input \nvoltage, and any load connected to the output may still \nconduct current. In the negative output voltage configura -\ntion (Figure 3), there is no DC connection between the \ninput and the output, and in shutdown mode the output is \npulled to GND.\nDesign Procedure\nSetting the Output Voltage\nFor either positive or negative output voltage applica -\ntions, set the MAX629’s output voltage using two external \nresistors, R1 and R2, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Since \nthe input bias current at FB has a 50nA maximum value, \nlarge resistors can be used in the feedback loop without PIN NAME FUNCTION\n1 SHDNActive-Low Shutdown Input. A logic low puts the MAX629 in shutdown mode and reduces supply \ncurrent to 1µA.\n2 POLPolarity Input. Changes polarity and threshold of FB to allow regulation of either positive or negative \noutput voltages. Set POL = GND for positive output voltage or set POL = V CC for negative output \nvoltage.\n3 REF1.25V Reference Output. Bypass to GND with a 0.1µF capacitor for I REF  ≤ 10µA.

Begin by selecting R2 to be \nin the 10kΩ to 200kΩ range, and calculate R1 using the \napplicable equation from the following subsections.\nPositive Output Voltages\nFor positive output voltages, use the typical boost config -\nuration shown in Figure 2, connecting POL to GND. This \nsets the threshold voltage at FB to equal V REF. Choose \nthe value of R2 and calculate R1 as follows:\nOUT\nREFVR1 R2 1V\uf8eb\uf8f6= ×−\uf8ec\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\uf8f8\nwhere V REF = 1.25V.\nNegative Output Voltages\nFor negative output voltages, configure R1 and R2 as \nshown in Figure 3, connecting POL to V CC. This sets the FB threshold voltage to GND so that negative voltages \ncan be regulated. Choose R2 and calculate R1 as follows:\nOUT\nREF|V |R1 R2V= ×\nwhere V REF = 1.25V.\nFigure 3 demonstrates generation of a negative output \nvoltage by following the MAX629 with an inverting charge \npump. This configuration limits |V OUT| to values between \n-|VIN| and -28V. If smaller negative output voltages are \nrequired, D2’s cathode can be connected to V IN. This \nalternative configuration permits output voltages smaller \nthan -|V IN|, but cannot be used for output voltages more \nnegative than -|28V -V IN|. It produces roughly one-half the \noutput current as the standard configuration and is typi -\ncally 5% less efficient.Figure 1.

A higher current \nlimit increases the amount of energy stored in the inductor \nduring each cycle, which provides a higher output current \ncapability. For higher output current applications, choose \nthe 500mA current-limit option by connecting ISET to \nVCC. When lower output current is required, the 250mA \ncurrent limit can provide several advantages. First, a \nsmaller inductor can be used, which saves board area \nand cost. Second, the smaller energy transfer per cycle \nreduces output ripple for a given capacitor, providing \ndesign flexibility between board area, cost, and output rip -\nple by allowing cheaper, higher-ESR capacitors. Connect \nISET to GND to select the 250mA current-limit option.\nInductor Selection\nThe MAX629’s high switching frequency allows for the \nuse of a small inductor. The 47μH inductor shown in \nthe Typical Operating Circuit  is recommended for most applications. Larger inductances reduce the peak induc -\ntor current, but may limit output current capability at low \ninput voltages and provide slower start-up times. Smaller \ninductances require less board space, but may cause \ngreater peak current due to current-sense comparator \npropagation delay. If input voltages below 2V will be com -\nmon, reducing the inductance to 22μH might improve per -\nformance; however, maximum load current and efficiency \nmay decline. It is important to thoroughly test operation \nunder all input and output conditions to ensure proper \ncomponent selection.\nInductors with a ferrite core or equivalent are recom -\nmended; powder iron cores are not recommended for \nuse with high switching frequencies. The inductor’s incre -\nmental saturation rating must exceed the selected current \nlimit. For highest efficiency, use an inductor with a low DC \nresistance (under 100mΩ). See Table 1 for a list of induc -\ntor suppliers.\nFigure 2. +24V for a Positive LCD Bias Figure 3. -20V for a Negative LCD BiasMAX629SHDNVOUT\n+24V VCC \n+2.7V\nTO +5.5VVIN \n+0.8V\nTO +24V\n*\nC3\n0.1µF\nC4\n0.1µFC1\n10µF\n35V\nC2\n10µF\n35VCF\n150pFR1\n576k\n1%\nR2\n31.6k\n1%L1\n47µH\nD1\nMBR0540L\nLXVCC\nGNDFBISET\nREFPOLMAX629C1\n10µF\n35V\nC3\n0.1µFL1\n47µH\nR1\n576k\n1%\nR2\n35.7k\n1%D1D1 = D2 = MBR0540L\nD2R3\n2ΩC5\n2.2µF\nC2\n10µF\n35VCF\n150pF\nC4\n0.1µFVCC\n+2.7V\nTO +5.5VVIN\n+0.8V\n TO +15V \nVOUT\n-20V LXVCC\nGNDFB\nREFPOLISET*\nSHDN\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 7\nMAX629 28V, Low-Power, High-Voltage,  \nBoost or Inverting DC-DC Converter\nDiode Selection\nThe MAX629’s high switching frequency demands a \nhigh-speed rectifier. Schottky diodes, such as the 1N5819 \nor MBR0530L, are recommended. Make sure that the \ndiode’s peak current rating exceeds the peak current \nset by ISET, and that its breakdown voltage exceeds the \noutput voltage. Schottky diodes are preferred due to their \nlow forward voltage. However, ultrahigh-speed silicon \nrectifiers are also acceptable. Table 1 lists Schottky diode \nsuppliers.\nCapacitor Selection\nOutput Filter Capacitor\nThe primary criterion for selecting the output filter capaci -\ntor is low effective series resistance (ESR). The product \nof the peak inductor current and the output filter capaci -\ntor’s ESR determines the amplitude of the high-frequency \nripple seen on the output voltage. These requirements \ncan be balanced by appropriate selection of the current \nlimit, as discussed in the Setting the Current Limit  sec-\ntion. Table 1  lists some low-ESR capacitor suppliers. See \nthe Output Voltage Ripple graph in the Typical Operating \nCharacteristics  section.\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nAlthough the output current of many MAX629 applications \nmay be relatively small, the input must be designed to \nwithstand current transients equal to the inductor current \nlimit. The input bypass capacitor reduces the peak cur -\nrents drawn from the voltage source and reduces noise caused by the MAX629’s switching action. The input \nsource impedance determines the size of the capaci -\ntor required at the input (V IN). As with the output filter \ncapacitor, a low-ESR capacitor is recommended. A 10μF, \nlow-ESR capacitor is adequate for most applications, \nalthough smaller bypass capacitors may also be accept -\nable. Bypass the IC separately with a 0.1μF ceramic \ncapacitor placed as close as possible to the V CC and \nGND pins.\nReference Capacitor\nBypass REF to GND with a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor for \nREF currents up to 10μA. REF can source up to 100μA \nof current for external loads. For 10μA ≤ I REF ≤ 100μA, \nbypass REF with a 0.47μF capacitor.\nFeed-Forward Capacitor\nParallel a capacitor (C F) across R1 to compensate the \nfeedback loop and ensure stability ( Figure 2  and Figure 3 ). \nValues up to 270pF are recommended for most applica -\ntions. Choose the lowest capacitor value that ensures \nstability; high capacitance values may degrade line regu -\nlation.\nApplications Information\nAdjusting the Output Voltage\nMany biasing applications require an adjustable output \nvoltage, which is easily obtained using the configuration \nin Figure 4 . In this circuit, an external bias voltage (which \nmay be generated by a potentiometer, a DAC, or other \nmeans) is coupled to FB through the resistor R B. The \noutput voltage of this circuit is given by:\n( ) OUT INIT FB BIAS\nBR1V V VVR= +−\nwhere V INIT is the fixed output voltage as calculated in \nthe section Setting the Output Voltage , and V FB is equal \nto either V REF (1.25V) for the positive configuration or \n0V for the negative configuration. Proper choice of R B \nprovides a wide range of available output voltages using \nsimple external components to generate V BIAS.\nInput Voltage Range\nAlthough, in many cases, the MAX629 and the inductor \nare powered from the same source, it is often advan -\ntageous in battery-powered applications to power the \ndevice from an available regulated supply and to power \nthe inductor directly from a battery.

Using separate supplies for V CC and \nVIN also reduces noise injection onto V CC by isolating it \nfrom the switching transients, allowing a smaller, less-\nexpensive input filter capacitor to be used in many appli -\ncations. If input voltages below 2V will be common, reduc -\ning the inductor to 22μH may improve performance in this \nvoltage range, at the potential cost of some decrease in \nmaximum load current and efficiency.\nIn the negative configuration shown in Figure 3 , the invert -\ning charge pump injects current into LX with each cycle. The amount of charge injected increases at higher V IN, \nand may prematurely trip the internal currentlimit thresh -\nold.

In applications with a different input voltage range, \nR3 can be increased or decreased as necessary, with a \nresulting efficiency change of roughly 0.5%/Ω.\nLayout Considerations\nProper PC board layout is essential due to high current \nlevels and fast switching waveforms that radiate noise. \nIt is recommended that initial prototyping be performed \nusing the MAX629 evaluation kit or equivalent PC board-\nbased design. Breadboards or proto-boards should never \nbe used when prototyping switching regulators. It is impor -\ntant to connect the GND pin, the input bypass-capacitor \nground lead, and the output filter capacitor ground lead \nto a single point (star ground configuration) to minimize \nground noise and improve regulation. Also, minimize lead \nlengths to reduce stray capacitance, trace resistance, and \nradiated noise, with preference given to the feedback cir -\ncuit, the ground circuit, and LX. Place R1 and R2 as close \nto the feedback pin as possible. Place the input bypass \ncapacitor as close as possible to V CC and GND.\nRefer to the MAX629 evaluation kit data sheet for an \nexample of proper board layout.Figure 4.
