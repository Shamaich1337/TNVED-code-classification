Internal matching is such that the part can be used\neffectively in both 50 \uf057 and 75\uf057 systems. The standard evaluation board is 50 \uf057, as are the corresponding specifications\nshown within the data sheet. Perhaps more convenient for the 75 \uf057 designer, would be alternate products RF2360 and CXE-\n2089Z. These two devices see very similar performance to RF3827, and standard 75 \uf057 evaluation boards are available.\nAn important note concerning RF3827 layout would apply to pa ckage pins 2 and 10. These two pins have no internal connec-\ntion. They are, however, connected externally to RF input and output traces on the standard evaluation board. Given their closeproximity to the actual input and output pins, this is simply a matter of convenience.\nThe standard RF3827 evaluation board is matched to provide ex cellent performance from 50MHz to 1000MHz. An application\nschematic is also shown for 5MHz to 200MHz, in the event lower frequency operation is desired. Specifications are shown in\nthe tabular sections for the condition V\nDD=8V.
