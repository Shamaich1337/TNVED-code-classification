The \ntransceiver implements the Ethernet physical layer portion of the 1000 BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and \n10BASE-T standards. It is manufactured using standard \ndigital CMOS process and contains all the active circuitry required to implement the physical layer functions to \ntransmit and receive data on standard CAT 5 unshielded \ntwisted pair.\nThe device supports the RGMII (Reduced pin count \nGMII) and SGMII for direct connection to a MAC/Switch \nport. The SGMII can also be used on media/line side to \nconnect to SFP modules that support 1000BASE-X, \n100BASE-FX and SGMII. It al so supports Copper/Fiber \nAuto-media applications with RGMII as the MAC \ninterface. SGMII operates at  1.25 Gbps over a single \ndifferential pair thus reducing power and number of I/Os \nused on the MAC interface.\nThe device integrates MDI term ination resistors into the \nPHY. This resistor integrat ion simplifies board layout and \nreduces board cost by reducing the number of external components. The new Marvell\n® calibrated resistor \nscheme will achieve and exceed the accuracy \nrequirements of the IEEE 802.3 return loss specifications.\nThe device has an integrated switching voltage regulator \nto generate all required voltages. The device can run off \na single 3.3V supply. The device supports 1.8V, 2.5V, \nand 3.3V LVCMOS I/O Standards.\nThe 88E1510/88E1518/88 E1512/88E1514 device \nsupports Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) and Precise Timing Protocol (PTP) Time Stamping, which is based on \nIEEE1588 version 2 and IEEE802.1AS.\nThe 88E1510/88E1518/88 E1512/88E1514 device \nsupports IEEE 802.3az-2010 E nergy Efficient Ethernet \n(EEE) and is IEEE 8 02.3az-2010 compliant.\nThe device incorporates the Marvell Advanced Virtual \nCable Tester\n® (VCT™) feature, which us es Time Domain \nReflectometry (TDR) technology for the remote \nidentification of potential cable malfunctions, thus \nreducing equipment returns and service calls. Using VCT, the Alaska device detects and reports potential cabling issues such as pair swaps, pair polarity and \nexcessive pair skew. The device will also detect cable \nopens, shorts or any impedance mismatch in the cable \nand reporting accurately within one meter the distance to the fault. \nThe device uses advanced mixed-signal processing to \nperform equalization, echo and crosstalk cancellation, \ndata recovery, and error correction at a Gigabits per \nsecond data rate. The device achieves robust performance in noisy environments with very low power \ndissipation. \nFeatures\n\uf06e10/100/1000BASE-T IE EE 802.3 compliant \n\uf06eMultiple Operating Modes\n•RGMII to Copper\n•SGMII to Copper (88E1512/88E1514 device \nonly)\n•RGMII to Fiber/SGMII (88E1512 device only)\n•RGMII to Copper/Fiber/SGMII with Auto-Media Detect (88E1512 device only)\n•Copper to Fiber (1000BASE-X) (88E1512/88E1514)\n\uf06eFour RGMII timing modes including integrated \ndelays - This eliminates the need for adding trace \ndelays on the PCB\n\uf06eSupports 1000BASE-X and 100BASE-FX on the \nFiber interface along with SGMII (88E1512 device \nonly)\n\uf06eSupports LVCMOS I/O Standards on the RGMII\n\uf06eSupports Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) - IEEE 802.3az-2010 compliant\n•EEE Buffering\n•Incorporates EEE buffering  for seamless support \nof legacy MACs\n\uf06eUltra Low Power\n\uf06eIntegrated MDI termination resistors that eliminate \npassive components\n\uf06eIntegrated Switching Voltage Regulators\n\uf06eSupports Green Ethernet\n•Active Power Save Mode\n•Energy Detect and Energy Detect+ low power \nmodes\n\uf06eIEEE1588 version 2 Time Stamping\n                         \nDoc.

The RGMII is  always a system interface. The SGMII can either \nbe a system interface, or a media interface. (The system interface is also known as MAC interface. It is typically the connection between the PHY and the MAC or the system ASIC). Block diagrams \nshowing the different applications of the 88E 1510/88E1518/88E1512/88E1514 devices are provided \nin Figure 9 , Figure 10 , and Figure 11 .\n                         \nThe 88E1512/88E1514 device can be used in me dia conversion applications that require a \nconversion from 1000BASE-T to 1000BASE-X pr ovided the 1000BASE-X auto negotiation is \ndisabled on both the upstream device and on the 88E1512/88E1514 device. The 88E1512/88E1514 device in this application must be configured to operate in SGMII to Copper(MODE[2:0]=001) for the \nconversion with the SGMII Auto-Negotiation disabled through Register 0_1.12=0. \nWhen used as a system interface, the device impl ements the PHY SGMII Auto -Negotiation status \n(link, duplex, etc.) advertisem ents as specified in the Cisco SGMII specification. The system \ninterface replicates the speed and duplex setting of the media interface.\nWhen used as a Media interface, the device impl ements the MAC SGMII Auto-Negotiation function, \nwhich monitors PHY status advertisements.\nFor details of how SGMII Auto-Negotiation operates, see Section 2.8.3, SGMII Auto-Negotiation, \non page 53  as well as the Cisco SGMII specification 1.8.\n                         \n                         Figure 9: 88E1512/88E1514 SGMII/SERDES System to Copper Media Interface Example\n                         \n10/100/1000 Mbps \nTransceiverSERDES \nSGMII Alaska® 88E1512/88E1514 \nPHY DeviceMagneticsMedia Type\n- 10BASE-T\n- 100BASE-TX- 1000BASE-TRJ-45\nFigure 10: 88E1510/88E1518 RGMII Syst em to Copper Interface Example\n                         \n10/100/1000 Mbps \nEthernet MACSystem \nInterface \n- RGMII Alaska® 88E1510/88E1518 \nPHY DeviceMagneticsMedia Type\n- 10BASE-T\n- 100BASE-TX- 1000BASE-TRJ-45\nFigure 11: 88E1512 RGMII System to SERDES Interface Example\n                         \n10/100/1000 Mbps \nEthernet MAC \nwith RGMIISystem \nInterface \n- RGMII Alaska® 88E1512 \nPHY DeviceSFPMedia Type\n- SGMII \n- 1000BASE-X\n- 1000BASE-FX\nPHY Functional Specifications\nCopper Media Interface\n                         \nCopyright © 2022 Marvell Doc. No. MV-S107146-U0 Rev. F\nJanuary 6, 2022 Document Classification: Public Page 39The 88E1512 device supports 5 modes of operation as shown in Table 34 .  For modes of operation \nsupported by 88E1510, 88E1518, 88E1514, refer to Table 1 .\nThe behavior of the 1.25 GHz SERDES interface is selected by setting the MODE[2:0] register in \n20_18.2:0. Th e SERDES can operate in 100BASE-FX, 10 00BASE-X, SGMII (System), and SGMII \n(Media). \n                         \n20_18.2:0 defaults to 111 for 88E1512/88E1514. Therefore 20_18.2:0 must be programmed with the \ndesired mode of operation.\n20_18.2:0 defaults to 000 for 88E1510/88E1518.\nWhen link is up, two of the three interfaces pass packets back and forth. The unused interface is \npowered down. \nThere is no need to power down the unused interfac e via registers 0_0.11 and 0_1.11. The unused \ninterface will automatically power down when not needed.\n2.2 Copper Media Interface\nThe copper interface consists of the MDIP/N[3:0] pins that connect to the physical media for 1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 10 BASE-T modes of  operation. \nThe device integrates MDI termination resistors.  The IEEE 802.3 specification requires that both \nsides of a link have termination resistors to prevent reflections. Traditionally, these resistors and \nadditional capacitors are placed on the board bet ween a PHY device and the magnetics. The \nresistors have to be very accura te to meet the strict  IEEE return loss requirements. Typically, ± 1% \naccuracy resistors are used on the board. These additional components between the PHY and the \nmagnetics complicate board layout. Integrating the resistors has many advantages including \ncomponent cost savings, better ICT yield, boar d reliability improvements, board area savings, \nimproved layout, and signal integrity improvements. \n2.2.1 Transmit Side Network Interface\n2.2.1.1 Multi-mode TX Digital to Analog Converter\nThe device incorporates a multi-mode transmit DAC to generate filtered 4D PAM 5, MLT3, or \nManchester coded symbols. The transmit DAC performs signal wave shaping to reduce EMI. The transmit DAC is designed for very low parasitic loading capacitances to improve the return loss \nrequirement, which allows the use of low cost transformers.

In 100BASE-TX mode, slew rate control is used to minimize high frequency EMI. In \n10BASE-T mode, the output waveform is pre-equalized via a digital filter. \n2.2.2 Encoder\n2.2.2.1 1000BASE-T\nIn 1000BASE-T mode, the transmit data bytes are sc rambled to 9-bit symbols and encoded into 4D \nPAM5 symbols. Upon initialization, the initial scrambling seed is determined by the PHY address. This prevents multiple devices from outputting th e same sequence during idle, which helps to reduce \nEMI.\n2.2.2.2 100BASE-TX\nIn 100BASE-TX mode, the transmit data stream  is 4B/5B encoded, serialized, and scrambled.\n2.2.2.3 10BASE-T\nIn 10BASE-T mode, the transmit da ta is serialized and conver ted to Manchester encoding. \n2.2.3 Receive Side Network Interface\n2.2.3.1 Analog to Digital Converter\nThe device incorporates an advanced high spe ed ADC on each receive channel with greater \nresolution than the ADC used in the reference model of the IEEE 802.3ab standard committee. \nHigher resolution ADC results in better SNR, and therefore, lower error rates. Patented architectures \nand design techniques result in high differential and integral linearity, high power supply noise rejection, and low metastability error rate. The ADC samples the input signal at 125 MHz. \n2.2.3.2 Active Hybrid\nThe device employs a sophisticated on-chip hybrid to substantially reduce the near-end echo, which \nis the super-imposed transmit signal on the receiv e signal. The hybrid minimizes the echo to reduce \nthe precision requirement of the digital echo cancelle r. The on-chip hybrid allows both the transmitter \nand receiver to use the same transformer for coup ling to the twisted pair cable, which reduces the \ncost of the overall system.\n2.2.3.3 Echo Canceller\nResidual echo not removed by the hybrid and ec ho due to patch cord impedance mismatch, patch \npanel discontinuity, and variations in cable impedance along the twisted pair cable result in drastic SNR degradation on the receive signal. The device employs a fully developed digital echo canceller \nto adjust for echo impairments from more than 10 0 meters of cable. The echo canceller is fully \nadaptive to compensate for the time varying nature of channel conditions.\n2.2.3.4 NEXT Canceller\nThe 1000BASE-T physical layer uses all 4 pairs of wires to transmit data to reduce the baud rate \nrequirement to only 125 MHz. This results in sign ificant high frequency crosstalk between adjacent \npairs of cable in the same bundle. The device employs 3 parallel NEXT cancellers on each receive \nchannel to cancel any high frequency crosstalk in duced by the adjacent 3 transmitters. A fully \nadaptive digital filter is used to compensate for the time varying nature of channel conditions. \nPHY Functional Specifications\nCopper Media Interface\n                         \nCopyright © 2022 Marvell Doc. No. MV-S107146-U0 Rev. F\nJanuary 6, 2022 Document Classification: Public Page 412.2.3.5 Baseline Wander Canceller\nBaseline wander is more problematic in the 1 000BASE-T environment than  in the traditional \n100BASE-TX environment due to the DC baseline shif t in both the transmit and receive signals. The \ndevice employs an advanced baseline wander cancellation circuit to automatically compensate for this DC shift. It minimizes the effect of DC baseline shift on the overall error rate.\n2.2.3.6 Digital Adaptive Equalizer\nThe digital adaptive equalizer removes inter-symbol interference at the receiver. The digital adaptive equalizer takes unequalized signals from ADC output and uses a combination of feedforward equalizer (FFE) and decision feedback equalizer (D FE) for the best-optimized signal-to-noise (SNR) \nratio.\n2.2.3.7 Digital Phase Lock Loop\nIn 1000BASE-T mode, the slave transmitter must us e the exact receive clock frequency it sees on \nthe receive signal. Any slight long-term frequency phase jitter (frequency drift) on the receive signal \nmust be tracked and duplicated by the slave transmi tter; otherwise, the receivers of both the slave \nand master physical layer devices have difficulty canceling the echo and NEXT components. In the \ndevice, an advanced DPLL is used to recover and track the clock timing information from the receive signal. This DPLL has very low long-term phase jitt er of its own, thereby maximizing the achievable \nSNR.\n2.2.3.8 Link Monitor\nThe link monitor is responsible fo r determining if link is establish ed with a link partner. In 10BASE-T \nmode, link monitor function is performed by detecting the presence of valid link pulses (NLPs) on the MDIP/N pins. \nIn 100BASE-TX and 1 000BASE-T modes, link is esta blished by scrambled idles.\nIf Force Link Good register 16_0.10 is set high, the li nk is forced to be good and the link monitor is \nbypassed for 100BASE-TX and 10BASE-T modes. In the 1000BASE-T mode, register 16_0.10 has no effect.\n2.2.3.9 Signal Detection\nIn 1000BASE-T mode, si gnal detection is based on whether the local receiver has acquired lock to \nthe incoming data stream.\nIn 100BASE-TX mode, the signal detection function is based on the receive signal energy detected \non the MDIP/N pins that is continuously qualified by the squelch detect circuit, and the local receiver \nacquiring lock.\n2.2.4 Decoder\n2.2.4.1 1000BASE-T\nIn 1000BASE-T mode, the receive idle stream is analyzed so that the scrambl er seed, the skew \namong the 4 pairs, the pair swap order, and the polarity of the pairs can be accounted for. Once \ncalibrated, the 4D PAM 5 symbols are converted to  9-bit symbols that are then descrambled into \n8-bit data values. If the descrambler loses lock for any reason, the link is brought down and \ncalibration is restarted after the completion of Auto-Negotiation. \n                         \nDoc.

The NRZ \nstream is descrambled and aligned to the symbol boundaries. The aligned data is then parallelized \nand 5B/4B decoded. The receiver does not attempt to decode the data stream unless the scrambler \nis locked. The descrambler “locks” to the scrambler  state after detecting a sufficient number of \nconsecutive idle code-groups. Once locked, the descr ambler continuously monitors the data stream \nto make sure that it has not lost synchroniza tion. The descrambler is always forced into the unlocked  \nstate when a link failure condition is detected, or when insufficient idle symbols are detected.    \n2.2.4.3 10BASE-T\nIn 10BASE-T mode, the recovered 10BASE-T signal is decoded from Manchester to NRZ, and then \naligned. The alignment is necessary to insure that the start of frame delimiter (SFD) is aligned to the nibble boundary.\n2.3 1.25 GHz SERDES Interface\nThe 1.25 GHz SERDES Interface can be configured as  an SGMII to be hooked up to a MAC or as a \n100BASE-FX/1000BASE-X/SGMII to be hooked up to the media.\n2.3.1 Electrical Interface\nThe input and output buffers of the 1.25 GHz SERDES interface are internally terminated by 50 Ω \nimpedance. No external terminations are r equired. The output swing can be adjusted by \nprogramming register 26_1.2:0. The 1.25 GHz SE RDES I/Os are Current Mode Logic (CML) buffers. \nCML I/Os can be used to connect to other components  with PECL or LVDS I/Os. See the “Reference \nDesign Schematics” and “Fiber Interface” application note for details.\n                         \nFigure 12: CML I/Os\n                         \n50 ohmInternal bias1\nS_INP\n50 ohmInternal bias\nS_INNCML Inputs CML Outputs\n50 ohmInternal bias1\n50 ohm\nIsinkS_OUTP\nS_OUTN\n1.

This interface supports 10, 100 and 1000 \nMbps modes of operation.\n2.4.1.1 SGMII Speed and Link\nWhen the SGMII MAC interface is used, the media interface can only be copper. The operational \nspeed of the SGMII MAC interface is determined according to Table 35  media interface status \nand/or loopback mode. \n                         \nTwo registers are available to determine whether the SGMII achieved link and sync. Status Register \n17_1.5 indicates that the SERDES locked onto the incoming KDKDKD… sequence. Register 17_1.10 indicates whether link is established on the SERDES. If SGMII Auto-Negotiation is disabled, \nregister 17_1.10 has the same meani ng as register 17_1.5. If SGMII Auto-Negotiation is enabled, \nthen register 17_1.10 indicates whether SGMII Auto-Negotiation successfully established link.\n2.4.1.2 SGMII TRR Blocking\nWhen the SGMII receives a packet with odd number of bytes, a single symbol of carrier extension will be passed on and transmitted onto 1000BASE-T. This carrier extension may cause problems \nwith full-duplex MACs that incorrectly handle th e carrier extension symbols. When register 16_1.13 \nis set to 1, all carrier extend and carrier extend with error symbols received by the SGMII will be \nconverted to idle symbols when operating in full-duplex. Carrier extend and carrier extend with error \nsymbols will not be blocked when operating in half-duplex, or if register 16_1.13 is set to 0. Note that \nsymbol errors will continue to be propagated regardless of the setting of register 16_1.13. \n2.4.1.3 False SERDES Link Up Prevention\nThe SERDES interface can operat e in 1000BASE-X mode where an unconnected optic al receiver \ncan sometimes send full swing noise into the PHY. This  random noise will look like a real signal and \nfalsely cause the 1000BASE-X PCS to link up. \nA noise filtering state machine can be enabled to reduce the probability of false link up. When the \nstate machine is enabled it will cause a small del ay in link up time. 1000BASE-X noise filtering is \nenabled through the register below.\n                         Table 35: SGMII (System Interface) Operational Speed\nLink Status or Media Interface Status SGMII (MAC Interface) Speed\nNo Link Determined by speed setting of Register 21_\n2.6,13\nMAC Loopback Determined by speed setting of Register 21_2.6, \n13\n1000BASE-T at 1000 Mbps 1000 Mbps\n100BASE-TX at 100 Mbps 100 Mbps10BASE-T at 10 Mbps 10 Mbps\nTable 36: Fiber Noise Filtering\nRegister Function Setting Mode HW \nRstSW Rst\n26_1.14 1000BASE-X \nNoise Filtering1 = Enable\n0 = DisableR/W 0 Retain\n                         \nDoc.

When \nthe speed of the PHY changes, a similar stretching of the positive or negative pulse is allowed. No \nglitching of the clocks is allowed during speed transitions.\nThe MAC must hold TX_CTRL (TX_CTL) low until t he MAC has ensured that TX_CTRL (TX_CTL) is \noperating at the same speed as the PHY.\n2.4.4 TX_ER and RX_ER Coding\nSee the RGMII Specifications for definitions of TX_ER, RX_ER, and in band status coding.\nIn RGMII mode, Register 21_2.3 is the register bit used to block carrier extension.\n2.5 Loopback\nThe device implements various different loopback paths.\n2.5.1 System Interface Loopback\nThe functionality, timing, and signal integrity of the System interface can be tested by placing the \ndevice in System interface loopback mode. This can be accomplished by setting register 0_0.14 = 1, \nif copper is the selected media, or 0_1.14 = 1, if fiber is the selected media. In loopback mode, the \ndata received from the MAC is not transmitted out on the media interface. Instead, the data is looped back and sent to the MAC. During loopback, media link will be lost and packets will not be received. \nIf loopback is enabled while Auto-Negotiating, FLP Auto-Negotiation codes will be transmitted onto \nthe copper media. If loopback is enabled in forced 10BASE-T mode, 10BASE-T idle link pulses will \nbe transmitted on the copper side. If loopback is enabled in forced 100BASE-T mode, 100BASE-T \nidles will be transmitt ed on the copper side.\nThe speed of the SGMII or RGMII is determined by register 21_2.6, 13 during loopback. 21_2.2:6,13 \nis 00 = 10 Mbps, 01 = 100 Mbps, 10 = 1000 Mbps. \n                         \nDoc.

Frames from a link partner into the PHY, before reaching the MAC interface pins, are \nlooped back and sent out on the line. They are also  sent to the MAC. The packets received from the \nMAC are ignored during line loopback. Refer to Figure 16 . This allows the link partner to receive its \nown frames.\nBefore enabling the line loopback feature, the PHY must first establish link to another PHY link \npartner. If Auto-Negotiation is enabled, both link partners should advertise the same speed and \nfull-duplex. If Auto-Negotiation is disabled, both link partners need to be forced to the same speed \nand full-duplex. Once link is established, the line loopback mode can be enabled. \nRegister 21_2.14 = 1 enables the line loopback on the copper interface.\nRegister 16_1.12 = 1 and 16_1.8 = 0 enables the line loopback of the 1000BASE-X/SGMII media \ninterface.\n                         \nFigure 16: Copper Line Loopback Data Path\n                         \nSERDES (SGMII) or RGMII\nPCS (Copper)\nPMA (Copper)\nPMD (Copper)MAC\nSystem Interface\n21_2.14 = 1\nCopper Interface\n                         \nDoc.

For \n1000BASE-T mode, register 18_6.3 must be set to 1 to enable the external loop back. All copper \nmodes require an external loopback stub.\nThe loopback stub consists of a plastic RJ-45 header, connecting RJ-45 pair 1,2 to pair 3,6 and \nconnecting pair 4,5 to pair 7,8, as seen in Figure 18 .\n                         Figure 17: Fiber Line Loopback Data Path\n                         \nRGMII\nPCS (Fiber)\nPMA (Fiber)\nPMD (Fiber)MAC\nSystem Interface\n16_1.12 = 1\nand 16_1.8 = 0\nFiber Interface\n(1000BASE-X or SGMII Media)\nFigure 18: Loopback Stub (Top View with Tab up)\n                         \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nPHY Functional Specifications\nResets\n                         \nCopyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

Instead of a normal RJ-45 cable, the loopback stubs allows the PHY to self-link at 10/100/1000 Mbps. It also allows the actual external loopback. See Figure 19 .

In Mode 2, the 10BASE-T link pulses are sent  once every second whil e listening for energy \non the line. \nDetails of each mode are described below.\n2.7.1.1 IEEE Power Down Mode\nThe standard IEEE power down mode is entered by se tting register 0_0.11 or 0_1.11. In this mode, \nthe PHY does not respond to any system interface (i.e., RGMII/SGMII) signals except the \nMDC/MDIO. It also does not respond to an y activity on the copper or fiber media. \nIn this power down mode, the PHY cannot wake up on its own by detecting activity on the media. It \ncan only wake up by setting registers 0_0.11 and 16_0.2 = 0 for copper and 0_1.11 = 0 for Fiber.\nNote that Register 0_0.11 or 16_0.2 may be set to 1 to power down the copper media.\nAs shown in Table 39 , each power down control independently powers down its respective circuits. \nIn general, it is not necessary to  power down an unused  interface. The PHY w ill automatically power \ndown any unused circuit. \nThe automatic PHY power management can be overridden by setting the power down control bits. \nThese bits have priority over the PHY power man agement in that the circuit can not be powered up \nby the power management when its associated power down bit is set to 1. When a circuit is power back up by setting the bit to 0, a software reset is also automatically sent to the corresponding \ncircuit.\n                         \n2.7.1.2 Copper Energy Detect Modes\nThe device can be placed in energy detect power down modes by selecting either of the two energy detect modes. Both modes enable the PHY to wake up on its own by detecting activity on the CAT 5 \ncable. The status of the energy detect is reported  in register 17_0.4 and the energy detect changes \nare reported in register 19_0.4 . The energy detect modes only app ly to the copper media. The \nenergy detect modes will not work while Fiber/Copper Auto Select ( 2.5 “Fiber/Copper \nAuto-Selection” on page 45 ) is enabled. Normal 10/100/1000 Mbps operation can be entered by \nturning off energy detect mode by setting register 16_0.9:8 to 0x.\nEnergy Detect (Mode 1) \nEnergy Detect (Mode 1) is entered by setting register 16_0.9:8 to 10.\nIn Mode 1, only the signal detection circuitry and serial management interface are active. If the PHY \ndetects energy on the line, it starts to Auto-Negot iate sending FLPs for 5 seconds. If at the end of \n5 seconds the Auto-Negotiation is not completed, then the PHY stops sending FLPs and goes back \nto monitoring receive energy. If Auto-Negotiation is completed, then the PHY goes into normal \n10/100/1000 Mbps operation. If during normal operation the link is lost, the PHY will re-start Auto-Negotiation. If no energy is detected after 5 seconds, the PHY goes back to monitoring receive \nenergy.Table 39: Power Down Control Bits\nReset Register Register Effect\n0_0.11 Copper Power Down\n16_0.2 Copper Power Down\n0_1.11 Fiber/SGMII Power Down\nPHY Functional Specifications\nAuto-Negotiation\n                         \nCopyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

Except \nfor this difference, Mode 2 is identical to Mode 1 ope ration. If the device is in Mode 1, it cannot wake \nup a connected device; therefore, the connected dev ice must be transmitting NLPs, or either device \nmust be woken up through register access. If the device is in Mode 2, then it can wake a connected \ndevice. \nPower Down Modes\nWhen the PHY exits power down (register 0_0.11= 0 and 16_0.2=0) the active state will depend on \nwhether the energy detect function is enabled (regist er 16_0.9:8 = 1x). If the energy detect function \nis enabled, the PHY will transition to the energy detec t state first and will wake up only if there is a \nsignal on the wire.\n                         \n2.7.2 RGMII/SGMII MAC Interface Power Down\nIn some applications, the MAC interface must run continuously regardless of the state of the media \ninterface. Additional power will be required to  keep the MAC interface running during low power \nstates.\nIf absolute minimal power consumption is required during network interface power down mode or in \nthe Energy Detect modes, then register 16_2.3 or 16_1.3 should be set to 0 to allow the MAC \ninterface to power down. \nIn general 16_2.3 is used when the network interface is copper and 16_1.3 is used when the \nnetwork interface is fiber. Note that for these settings to take effect a software reset must be issued.\n2.8 Auto-Negotiation\nThe device supports three types of Auto-Negotiation.\n\uf06e10/100/1000BASE-T Copper Auto-Negotiation.

It is used to negotiate speed, dupl ex, and flow control over CAT5 UTP cable. Once \nAuto-Negotiation is initiated, the device determines whether or not the remote device has \nAuto-Negotiation capability. If so, the device and the remote device negotiate the speed and duplex \nwith which to operate. \nIf the remote device does not have Auto-Negotiation capability, the device uses the parallel detect \nfunction to determine the speed of the remote device for 100BASE-TX and 10BASE-T modes. If link \nis established based on the parallel detect function, t hen it is required to establish link at half-duplex \nmode only. Refer to IEEE 802.3 clauses 28 and 40 for a full description of Auto-Negotiation. \nAfter hardware reset, 10/100/ 1000BASE-T Auto-Negotiation can be enabled and disabled via \nRegister 0_0.12. Auto MDI/MDIX and Auto-Negotiation may be disabled and enabled independently. When Auto-Negotiation is disabled, the speed a nd duplex can be set via registers 0_0.13, 0_0.6, \nand 0_0.8 respectively. When Auto-Negotiation is enabled the abilities that are advertised can be \nchanged via registers 4_0 and 9_0.\nChanges to registers 0_0.12, 0_0.13, 0_0.6 and 0_0.8 do not take effect unless one of the following \ntakes place: \n\uf06eSoftware reset (registers 0_0.15)\n\uf06eRestart Auto-Negotiation (register 0_0.9)\n\uf06eTransition from power down to power up (register 0_0.11)\n\uf06eThe copper link goes down\nTo enable or disable Auto-Negotiation, Register  0_0.12 should be changed simultaneously with \neither register 0_0.15 or 0_0.9 . For example, to disable Auto -Negotiation a nd force 10BASE-T \nhalf-duplex mode, register 0_0 should be written with 0x8000. \nRegisters 4_0 and 9_0 are internally latched once ev ery time the Auto-Negotiation enters the Ability \nDetect state in the arbitration state machine. Henc e, a write into Register 4_0 or 9_0 has no effect \nonce the device begins to transmit Fast Link Puls es (FLPs).This guarantees that sequences of FLPs \ntransmitted are consistent with one another. \nRegister 7_0 is treated in a similar way as  registers 4_0 and 9_0 during additional next page \nexchanges.\nIf 1000BASE-T mode is advertised, then the device  automatically sends the appropriate next pages \nto advertise the capability and negotiate Master/Slave mode of operation. If the user does not wish to transmit additional next pages, then the next page bit (Register 4_0.15) can be set to zero, and \nthe user needs to take no further action. \nIf next pages in addition to the ones required for 1000BASE-T are needed, then the user can set \nregister 4_0.15 to one, and send and receive ad ditional next pages via registers 7_0 and 8_0, \nrespectively. The device stores the previous results fr om register 8 in internal registers, so that new \nnext pages can overwrite register 8_0. \nNote that 1000BASE-T next page exchanges are auto matically handled by the device without user \nintervention, regardless of whether or not additional next pages are sent.\nOnce the device completes Auto-Negotiation, it updates the various status in registers 1_0, 5_0, 6_\n0, and 10_0. Speed, duplex, page received, and Auto-Negotiation completed status are also \navailable in registers 17_0 and 19_0. \nRefer to Register  17_0 and 19_0.\nPHY Functional Specifications\nAuto-Negotiation\n                         \nCopyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

It is used to \nAuto-Negotiate duplex and flow control over fiber cable. Registers 0_1, 4_1, 5_1, 6_1, and 15_1 are used to enable AN, advertise capabilities, determi ne link partner’s capabilities, show AN status, and \nshow the duplex mode of operation respectively. \nRegister 22.7:0 must be set to one to view the fiber Auto-Negotiation registers.\nThe device supports Next Page option for 1000BA SE-X Auto-Negotiation. Register 7_1 of the fiber \npages is used to transmit Next Pages, and register  8_1 of the fiber pages is used to store the \nreceived Next Pages. The Next Page exchange occu rs with software intervention. The user must set \nRegister 4_1.15 to enable fiber Next Page exchange. Each Next Page received in the registers \nshould be read before a new Next Page to be transmitted is loaded in Register 7_1. \nIf the PHY enables 1000BASE-X Auto-Negotiation and the link partner does not, the link cannot link \nup. The device implements an Auto-Negotiation bypass mode. For more details, see \nSection 2.8.3.1, Serial Interface Auto-Negotiation Bypass Mode, on page 53 .\n2.8.3 SGMII Auto-Negotiation\nSGMII is a de-facto stan dard designed by Cisco. SGMII uses 1 000BASE-X coding to send data as \nwell as Auto-Negotiation information between the PHY and the MAC. However, the contents of the \nSGMII Auto-Negotiation are different than the 1000BASE-X Auto -Negotiation. See the “Cisco SGMII \nSpecification” and the “MAC Interfaces and Auto-Negotiation” application note for further details. \nThe device supports SGMII with and without Auto -Negotiation. Auto-Negotiation can be enabled or \ndisabled by writing to Register 0_1.12 followed by a soft reset. If SGMII Auto-Negotiation is disabled, \nthe MAC interface link, speed, and duplex stat us (determined by the media side) cannot be \nconveyed to the MAC from the PHY. The user must  program the MAC with this information in some \nother way (e.g., by reading PHY registers for li nk, speed, and duplex status). However, the \noperational speed of the SGMII will follow the speed of the media (See Table 35 on page 43 ) \nregardless of whether the Auto-Negotiation is enabled or disabled. \nIn case of RGMII to SGMII mode of operation, the SGMII behaves as if it were the SGMII on the \nMAC side of the interface. When Auto-Negotiation is enabled, the SGMII Auto-Negotiation information like the speed, duplex, and link received from the PHY is used for determining the mode \nof operation. The RGMII will be adjusted accordingly when the SGMII Auto-Negotiation is \ncompleted.\n2.8.3.1 Serial Interface Auto-Negotiation Bypass Mode \n If the MAC or the PHY implements the Auto-Negotiation function and the other does not, two-way communication is not possible unless Auto-Negotiation is manually disabled and both sides are \nconfigured to work in the same operational modes.  To solve this problem, the device implements the \nSGMII Auto-Negotiation Bypass Mode.

If the device interoperates with a \ndevice that cannot automatically correct for crossover, the device makes the necessary adjustment prior to commencing Auto-Negotiation. If the device interoperates with a device that implements \nMDI/MDIX crossover, a random algorithm as described in IEEE 802.3 clause 40.4.4 determines \nwhich device performs the crossover. \nWhen the device interoperates with legacy 10BASE-T devices that do not implement \nAuto-Negotiation, the device follows the same al gorithm as described above since link pulses are \npresent. However, when inter operating with legacy 100BASE-TX devices that do not implement \nAuto-Negotiation (i.e. link pulses are not present), the device uses signal detect to determine \nwhether or not to crossover. \nThe auto MDI/MDIX crossover function can be disabled via register 16_0.6:5.\nThe pin mapping in MDI and MDIX modes is shown in Table 43 . \n                         \n                         \nThe MDI/MDIX status is indicated by Register 1 7_0.6. This bit indicates whether the receive pairs \n(3,6) and (1,2) are crossed over . In 1000BASE-T operation, the dev ice can correct for crossover \nbetween pairs (4,5) and (7,8) as shown in Table 43 . However, this is not indicated by Register 17_\n0.6.\nIf 1000BASE-T link is established, pairs (1,2) and (3,6 ) crossover is reported in register 21_5.4, and \npairs (4,5) and (7,8) crossover is reported in register 21_5.5.\n2.13 Polarity Correction\nThe device automatical ly corrects polarity errors on the receive pairs in 1000BASE-T and 10BASE-T \nmodes.

Once the descrambler is locked, the polarity is also locked on all pairs. The polarity becomes unlocked only when the receiver loses lock.\nIn 10BASE-T mode, polarity errors  are corrected based on the dete ction of validly spaced link \npulses. The detection begins during the MDI crossover detection phase and locks when the \n10BASE-T link is up. The polarity becomes unlocked when link is down. \nThe polarity correction status is indicated by Regi ster 17_0.1. This bit indicates whether the receive \npair (3,6) is polarity reversed in MDI mode of operation. In MDIX mode of operation, the receive pair is (1,2) and Register 17_0.1 indicates whether this  pair is polarity reversed. Although all pairs are \ncorrected for receive polarity reversal, Register 17_0.1  only indicates polarity reversal on the pairs \ndescribed above.\nIf 1000BASE-T link is established  register 2 1_5.3:0 reports the polar ity on all 4 pairs.\nPolarity correction can be disabled by register write 1 6_0.1 = 1. Polarity will then be forced in normal \n10BASE-T mode.\n2.14 FLP Exchange Complete with No Link\nSometimes when link does not come up, it is difficult to determine whether the failure is due to the Auto-Negotiation Fast Link Pu lse (FLP) not completing or fr om the 10/100/1000 BASE-T link not \nbeing able to come up. \nRegister 19_0.3 is a sticky bit that gets set to 1 whenever the FLP exchang e is comple ted but the \nlink cannot be established for some reason. Once the bit is set, it can be cleared only by reading the register.\nThis bit will not be set if the FLP exchange is not completed, or if link is established.\n2.15 Duplex Mismatch Indicator\nWhen operating in half-duplex mode collisions should occur within the first 512 bit times. Collisions \nthat are detected after this point can indicate an incorrect environment (too many repeaters in the system, too long cable) or it can indicate that the  link partner thinks the link is a full-duplex link. \nRegisters 23_6.7:0, 23_6.15:8, 24_6.7:0, and 24_6.15:8 are 8 bit counters that count late collisions. They will increment only when the PHY is in ha lf-duplex mode and only applies to the copper \ninterface. Each counter in crements when a late collision is detect ed in a certain window as shown in \nTable 44 . The four late collision counters will increment  based on when the late collision starts. The \ncounters clear on read. If the counter reaches FF it will not roll over.\n                         \nTable 44: Late Collision Registers\nRegister Function Setting Mode\n23_6.15:8 Late Collision \n97-128 bytesThis counter increments by 1 when the PHY is in half-duplex and \na start of packet is received while the 96th to 128th bytes of the packet are transmitted.RO, SC\nThe measurement is done at the internal GMII.

In \norder to compensate for additional latency between the PHY and the MAC register 25_6.12:8 is \nused to move the window earlier. For example, if register 25_6.12.8 is set to 2 then the first window \nis 63 to 94 bytes, the second window is 95 to 129 bytes, etc. It is up to the user to program this \nregister correctly since it is system dependent.\n2.16 LED\nThe LED[2:0] pins can be used to drive LED pi ns. Registers 16_3, 17_3, and 18_3 control the \noperation of the LED pins. LED[1:0] are used to configure the PHY per Section 2.18.1, Hardware \nConfiguration, on page 65 . After the configuration is completed, LED[1:0] will operate per the setting \nin 16_3.7:0. \nIn general, 16_3.11:8 control the LED[2] pin, 16_3.7:4 control the LED[1] pin, and 16_3.3:0 control \nthe LED[0] pin. These are referred to as single LED modes. \nHowever, there are some LED modes where LED[ 1:0] operate as a unit. These are entered when \n16_3.3:2 are set to 11.

In order \nto make things more flexible registers 17_3.5:4, 17_3.3:2, and 17_3.1:0 specify the output polarity for the LED[2:0]. The lower bit of each pair specifies the on (active) state of the LED, either high or \nlow. The upper bit of each pair specifies whether the off state of the LED should be driven to the \nopposite level of the on state or Hi-Z.\n                         \n                         \n2.16.2 Pulse Stretching and Blinking\nRegister 18_3.14:12 specify the pulse stretching durat ion of a particular activity.

This is useful since the PHY is tri-spe ed and the three colors each represent one of the \nspeeds. Register 17_3.15:12 control the amount to mix in the LED[1] pin. Register 17_3.11:8 control \nthe amount to mix in the LED[0] pin. The mixing is  determined by the percentage of time the LED is \non during the active state. The percenta ge is selectable in 12.5% increments. \nNote that there are two types of bi-color LEDs. Th ere is the three terminal type and the 2 terminal \ntype. For example, the third and fourth LED block from the left in Figure 21  illustrates three terminal \ntypes, and the one on the far right is the two terminal type. In the three terminal type both of the \nLEDs can be turned on at the same time. Hence the sum of the percentage specified by 17_3.15:12 and 17_3.11:8 can exceed 100%. However, in the two terminal type the sum should never exceed \n100% since only one LED can be turned on at any given time.Table 46: Pulse Stretching and Blinking\nRegister Pin Definition\n18_3.14:12 Pulse stretch \nduration000 = No pulse stretching\n001 = 21 ms to 42 ms010 = 42 ms to 84 ms011 = 84 ms to 170 ms100 = 170 ms to 340 ms101 = 340 ms to 670 ms110 = 670 ms to 1.3s111 = 1.3s to 2.7s\n18_3.10:8 Blink Rate 000 = 42 ms\n001 = 84 ms010 = 170 ms011 = 340 ms100 = 670 ms101 to 111 = Reserved\nPHY Functional Specifications\nLED\n                         \nCopyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

These internal regulators generate 1.8V and 1.0V. The \nintegrated regulators greatly reduce the PCB BOM cost. If regulators are not used,  external supplies \n(1.8V and 1.0V)are needed. Table 61 and Table 62  lists the valid combinations of regulator usage.\n The VDDO supply can run at 2.5V or 3. 3V for the 88E1510 and 1.8V for 88E1518. \n88E1512/88E1514 VDDO can operate at 1.8V/2.5V/3.3V supplies depending on the VDDO_SEL pin \nselection.\n                         \n                         \n                         \n                         \n2.21.1 AVDD18\nAVDD18 is used as the 1.8V analog supply. AVDD18 can be supplied externally with 1.8V, or via the \n1.8V regulator. \n2.21.2 AVDDC18\nAVDDC18 is used as a 1.8V analog supply for XTAL_IN/OUT pins. AVDDC18 can be supplied \nexternally with 1.8V, or via the 1.8V regulator.\n2.21.3 AVDD33\nAVDD33 is used as a 3.3V analog supply.Note\uf06eIf VDDO is tied to either 1.8V or 2. 5V, then the I/Os are not 3.3V tolerant.\n\uf06eAVDDC18 is tied to 1.8V, so the XTAL_IN pin is not 2.5V/3.3V tolerant.\nTable 61: Power Supply Options - Inte grated Switching Regulator (REG_IN)\nFunctional \nDescriptionAVDD33 AVDDC18/AVDD18 DVDD Setup\nSupply Source 3.3V 1.8V from Internal \nRegulator1.0V from \nInternal RegulatorSingle 3.3V external supply\nInternal regulator enabled\nTable 62: Power Supply Options - External Supplies\nFunctional Description AVDD33 AVDDC18/AVDD18 DVDD Setup\nSupply Source 3.3V 1.8V External 1.0V from \nExternal3.3V, 1.8V, 1.0V external supplies\nInternal regulator disabled.\nNoteWhen internal regulator option is preferred, both 1.0V and 1.8V regulators must be \nused.

If the 1.8V or 1.0V regulators are not used, REG_IN must be left floating in addition to leaving REGCAP1 and REGCAP2 floating.\n2.21.6 AVDD18_OUT\nAVDD18_OUT is the internal regulator 1.8V output. This must be connected to 1.8V power plane that connects to AVDD18 and AVDDC18. If an external supply is used to supply AVDD18 and AVDDC18, AVDD18_OUT must be left floating.\n2.21.7 DVDD_OUT\nDVDD_OUT is the internal regulator 1.0V output. When internal regulator is used, DVDD_OUT must be connected to the DVDD plane.
