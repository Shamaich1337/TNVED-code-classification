The devices provide \nmultiple protection modes using very few external \ncomponents and are a robust defense against \noverloads, short circuits, voltage surges and \nexcessive inrush current.\nOutput slew rate and inrush current can be \nadjusted using a single external capacitor. Loads \nare protected from input overvoltage conditions by \ncutting off the output if input exceeds an adjustable \novervoltage threshold. The devices respond to output \noverload by actively limiting the current (during start-\nup) or breaking the circuit (during steady-state). \nThe overcurrent protection threshold as well as \nthe transient overcurrent blanking timer are user-\nadjustable. The current limit control pin also functions \nas an analog load current monitor.\nThe devices are available in a 2-mm × 2-mm, 10-\npin HotRod™ QFN package for improved thermal \nperformance and reduced system footprint.\nThe devices are characterized for operation over a \njunction temperature range of –40°C to +125°C.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS25981 RPW (VQFN-HR, 10) 2.00 mm × 2.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nTPS25981x IN OUT\nEN/UVLO\nILM dVdt GNDVIN = 2.7 to 16 V\nRILMVOUT\nCOUT\nPG\nFLT\nITIMER\nCDVDT CITIMERVLOGIC\nEN/OVLO\nSimplified SchematicTPS25981\nSLVSGG6B  – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The rising slew rate can be adjusted by adding capacitance from the dVdt pin \nto ground. As C dVdt is increased it slows the rising slew rate (SR). See Slew Rate and Inrush Current Control (dVdt) section \nfor more details. The Turn-Off Delay and Fall Time, however, are dependent on the RC time constant of the load capacitance \n(COUT) and Load Resistance (R L). The Switching Characteristics are only valid for the power-up sequence where the supply \nis available in steady-state condition and the load voltage is completely discharged before the device is enabled. Typical \nvalues are taken at T J = 25°C unless specifically noted otherwise.

When the input supply voltage (V IN) exceeds the \nUndervoltage Protection threshold (V UVP), the device samples the EN/UVLO pin. A high level (> V UVLO) on this \npin enables the internal power path to start conducting and allow current to flow from IN to OUT. When EN/UVLO \nis held low (< V UVLO), the internal power path is turned off.\nAfter a successful start-up sequence, the device now actively monitors its load current and input voltage, \nand controls the internal FET to ensure that the user adjustable overcurrent protection threshold (I LIM) is not \nexceeded and overvoltage spikes are cut-off after they cross the user adjustable overvoltage lockout threshold \n(VOVLO). The device also provides fast protection against severe overcurrent during short-circuit events. This \nfeature keeps the system safe from harmful levels of voltage and current. At the same time, a user adjustable \novercurrent blanking timer allows the system to pass moderate transient peaks in the load current profile without \ntripping the eFuse. This feature ensures a robust protection solution against real faults which is also immune to \ntransients, thereby ensuring maximum system uptime.\nThe device also has a built-in thermal sensor based shutdown mechanism to protect itself in case the device \ntemperature (T J) exceeds the recommended operating conditions.TPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\n www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nHFET Control\nCurrent Limit Amplifier5 6 IN\n4CP 7\n9OUT\nILMSC\nOC+-\n+\n- 10DVDT\nITIMERTemp Sense and \nOvertemperature \nprotection\nFLTITIMER_EXPIRED\n8GNDTPS25981xx\nINRUSH_DONE+-\n+\n-2.8 V\nGHITSD+\n-+-+\n-2\n1 EN/UVLO\nSWENUVPb\nOVLOb\nUVLOb\nSD\n0.75 V \x011x\nITIMER_EXPIREDFFT\n1.06 V\x002.57 V\n105 ms \nTIMER#R\nS Q/Q\nFLT\nILM Pin ShortTSDSD\nUVPb\nRETRY#\nITIMER_EXPIRED+-2x2.53 V\x02\n2.42 V\x03\n1.20 V \x04\n1.09 V \x05\n1.20 V\x06\n1.09 V\x07\n# Not applicable to TPS25981xL (Latch-off) variants \n* Not applicable for TPS259813x variantsRETRY#Short \nDetect\nILM Pin Short\n2 \x08A3.4 \tA+-\n229 mVFFT\nGHI\nINRUSH_DONE95.3 \nA/A 15.4 kΩ  UVLOb\nEN/OVLO\n3\nPGGHI\nOC\nGHI488 Ω  *\nwww.ti.comTPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe TPS25981xx eFuse is a compact, feature rich power management device that provides detection, protection \nand indication in the event of system faults.\n8.3.1 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO and UVP)\nThe TPS25981xx implements undervoltage protection on IN in case the applied voltage becomes too low for the \nsystem or device to properly operate. The undervoltage protection has a default lockout threshold of V UVP which \nis fixed internally. Also, the UVLO comparator on the EN/UVLO pin allows the undervoltage protection threshold \nto be externally adjusted to a user defined value. Figure 8-1  and Equation 1  show how a resistor divider can be \nused to set the UVLO set point for a given voltage supply.\nIN\nEN/UVLO\nGNDPower \nSupply\nR1\nR2\nFigure 8-1.

The OVLO comparator on the EN/OVLO pin allows the overvoltage protection threshold \nto be adjusted to a user defined value. After the voltage at the EN/OVLO pin crosses the OVLO rising threshold \nVOV(R) , the device turns off the power to the output. Thereafter, the devices wait for the voltage at the EN/OVLO \npin to fall below the OVLO falling threshold V OV(F) before the output power is turned ON again. The rising and \nfalling thresholds are slightly different to provide hysteresis.

TPS259814x Overvoltage Lockout and Recovery\nWhile recovering from a OVLO event, the TPS259814x variants start up with inrush control (dVdt).\n8.3.3 Inrush Current, Overcurrent, and Short-Circuit Protection\nTPS25981xx incorporates four levels of protection against overcurrent:\n1.Adjustable slew rate (dVdt) for inrush current control\n2.Adjustable threshold (I LIM) for overcurrent protection during start-up or steady-state\n3.Adjustable threshold (I SC) for fast-trip response to severe overcurrent during start-up or steady-state\n4.Fixed threshold (I FT) for fast-trip response to quickly protect against hard output short circuits during steady-\nstate\n8.3.3.1 Slew Rate (dVdt) and Inrush Current Control\nDuring hot-plug events or while trying to charge a large output capacitance at start-up, there can be a large \ninrush current. If the inrush current is not managed properly, it can damage the input connectors and cause the \nsystem power supply to droop leading to unexpected restarts elsewhere in the system. The inrush current during \nturn-on is directly proportional to the load capacitance and rising slew rate. Equation 3  can be used to find the \nslew rate (SR) required to limit the inrush current (I INRUSH ) for a given load capacitance (C OUT):\nSR \xa0V\nms=I I NRU S H \xa0 m A\nC O U T \xa0 µ F(3)\nA capacitor can be connected to the dVdt pin to control the rising slew rate and lower the inrush current during \nturn on.

When the load current exceeds the set overcurrent \nthreshold (I LIM) set by the ILM pin resistor (R ILM), but stays lower than the fast-trip threshold (2 × I LIM), the device \nstarts discharging the ITIMER pin capacitor using an internal 2- μA pulldown current. If the load current drops \nbelow I LIM before the ITIMER pin capacitor (C ITIMER ) discharges by ΔVITIMER , the ITIMER is reset by pulling it up \nto V INT internally and the circuit-breaker action is not engaged. This action allows short load transient pulses to \npass through the device without tripping the circuit. If the overcurrent condition persists, the C ITIMER  continues \nto discharge and after it discharges by ΔVITIMER , the circuit-breaker action turns off the FET immediately. At the \nsame time, the C ITIMER  is charged up to V INT again so that it is at its default state before the next overcurrent \nevent. This action ensures the full blanking timer interval is provided for every overcurrent event. Equation 5  can \nbe used to calculate the R ILM value for a overcurrent threshold.\nR I LM \xa0 Ω =6585\nI LI M \xa0 A(5)\nNote\n1.Leaving the ILM pin open sets the current limit to nearly zero and results in the part breaking the \ncircuit with the slightest amount of loading at the output.\n2.Shorting the ILM pin to ground at any point during normal operation is detected as a fault and the \npart shuts down. There is a minimum current (I FLT) which the part allows in this condition before \nthe pin short condition is detected.\nThe duration for which transients are allowed can be adjusted using an appropriate capacitor value from ITIMER \npin to ground. Use Equation 6  to calculate the C ITIMER  value needed to set the desired transient overcurrent \nblanking interval.\nC I TI ME R \xa0 n F =t I TI ME R \xa0 ms \xa0 × \xa0 I I TI ME R \xa0 µ A\nΔ V I TI MER \xa0 V(6)TPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\n www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\nIOUT ILIM\n0\nTimeOUTVIN\n0ITIMER\n0\nTJTSD\nTJtITIMERTransient Overcurrent ITIMER expired Persistent Output Overload\nTSD HYSCircuit-Breaker \noperation\nPGVPG\n00tPGD¨VITIMER2 × I LIM\nVINT\nFLT VFLTFigure 8-4. TPS259814x Overcurrent Response \nNote\n1.Leave the ITIMER pin open to allow the part to break the circuit with the minimum possible delay.\n2.Shorting the ITIMER pin to ground results in minimum overcurrent response delay (similar to \nITIMER pin open condition), but increases the device current consumption. This action is not a \nrecommended mode of operation.\n3.Increasing the ITIMER cap value extends the overcurrent blanking interval, but it also extends the \ntime needed for the C ITIMER  to recharge up to V INT. If the next overcurrent event occurs before the \nCITIMER  is recharged fully, it takes lesser time to discharge to the ITIMER expiry threshold, thereby \nproviding a shorter blanking interval than intended.\n4.In low voltage applications, TI recommends adding a 30 kΩ resistor between the ITIMER pin and \nCITIMER  for improved immunity to supply noise or fluctuations.\nAfter the part shuts down due to a circuit-breaker fault, it either stays latched off (TPS259814L variant) or \nrestarts automatically after a fixed delay (TPS259814A variant).\n8.3.3.3 Active Current Limiting During Start-Up\nThe TPS259814x devices respond to output overcurrent conditions during start-up by actively limiting the \ncurrent. If the load current exceeds the set overcurrent threshold (I LIM) set by the ILM pin resistor (R ILM), but \nstays lower than the short-circuit threshold (2 × I LIM), the current limit loop starts regulating the FET to actively \nwww.ti.comTPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\nlimit the current to the set overcurrent threshold (I LIM). Equation 7  can be used to calculate the R ILM value for a \ndesired overcurrent threshold.\nR I LM \xa0 Ω =6585\nI LI M \xa0 A(7)\nNote\n1.Leaving the ILM pin open sets the current limit to nearly zero and results in the part entering \ncurrent limit with the slightest amount of loading at the output.\n2.The current limit circuit employs a foldback mechanism. The current limit threshold in the foldback \nregion (0 V < V OUT < V FB) is lower than the target steady-state overcurrent threshold (I LIM).\nDuring active current limit, the output voltage drops, resulting in increased device power dissipation across \nthe FET. If the device internal temperature (T J) exceeds the thermal shutdown threshold (TSD), the FET \nis turned off. After the part shuts down due to TSD fault, it either stays latched off (TPS25981xL variants) \nor restarts automatically after a fixed delay (TPS25981xA variants). For more details on device response to \novertemperature, see Overtemperature Protection (OTP) .\n8.3.3.4 Short-Circuit Protection\nDuring an output short-circuit event, the current through the device increases very rapidly. When a severe \novercurrent condition is detected, the device triggers a fast-trip response to limit the current to a safe level. The \ninternal fast-trip comparator employs a scalable threshold (I SC) which is equal to 2 × I LIM. This action enables \nthe user to adjust the fast-trip threshold rather than using a fixed threshold which can be too high for some \nlow current systems. The device also employs a fixed fast-trip threshold (I FT) to protect fast protection against \nhard short circuits during steady-state. The fixed fast-trip threshold is higher than the maximum recommended \nuser adjustable scalable fast-trip threshold. After the current exceeds I SC or I FT, the FET is turned off completely \nwithin t FT. Thereafter, the devices tries to turn the FET back on after a short de-glitch interval (30 μs) in a current \nlimited manner instead of a dVdt limited manner. This action ensures that the FET has a faster recovery after a \ntransient overcurrent event and minimizes the output voltage droop. However, if the fault is persistent, the device \nstays in current limit causing the junction temperature to rise and eventually enter thermal shutdown.

Analog Load Current Monitor Response\nNote\nThe ILM pin is sensitive to capacitive loading. Careful design and layout is needed to ensure the \nparasitic capacitive loading on the ILM pin is < 50 pF for stable operation.\n8.3.5 Overtemperature Protection (OTP)\nThe device monitors the internal die temperature (T J) at all times and shuts down the part as soon as the \ntemperature exceeds a safe operating level (TSD) thereby protecting the device from damage. The device does \nturn back on until the junction cools down sufficiently, that is the die temperature falls below (TSD – TSD HYS).\nWhen the TPS25981xL (latch-off variant) detects thermal overload, it is shut down and remains latched-off until \nthe device is power cycled or re-enabled. When the TPS25981xA (auto-retry variant) detects thermal overload, it \nremains off until it has cooled down by TSD HYS. Thereafter, the device remains off for an additional delay of t RST \nafter which it automatically retries to turn on if it is still enabled.\nTable 8-1.

This action also releases the FLT pin and resets the t RST timer for \nthe TPS25981xA (auto-retry) variants.\nDuring a latched fault, pulling the EN/UVLO just below the UVLO threshold has no impact on the device. This \nfact is true for both TPS25981xL (latch-off) and TPS25981xA (auto-retry) variants.\nFor TPS25981xA (auto-retry) variants, on expiry of the t RSTtimer after a fault, the device restarts automatically \nand the FLT pin is de-asserted.\n8.3.7 Power Good Indication (PG)\nThe TPS259814x provides an active high digital output (PG) which serves as a power good indication signal and \nis asserted high when the device is in steady-state and ready to deliver power. The PG is an open-drain pin and \nmust be pulled up to an external supply.\nAfter power up, PG is pulled low initially. The device initiates a inrush sequence in which the FET is turned on in \na controlled manner. When the FET gate voltage reaches the full overdrive indicating that the inrush sequence is \ncomplete, the PG is asserted after a de-glitch time (t PGA).\nPG is de-asserted if at any time the FET is turned off. The PG de-assertion de-glitch time is t PGD.\nwww.ti.comTPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\nIN\n0\nTimeOUT\n0\nPGVPG\n0\nVHGateVOUT + 2.8 V\n0EN/UVLOVUVLO(R)\n0\nSlew rate (dVdt) controlled \nstartup/Inrush current limiting\nVIN\nILIM\nIINRUSH\n0IOUTtPGA\n0VIN\ndVdt (1)Device Enabled\n0VIN\ndVdt (2)\n(1) Applicable only for TPS259814x variants \n(2) Applicable only for TPS259813x variants  Figure 8-7.

However, there is no active pulldown \nin this condition to drive this pin all the way down to 0 V. If the PG pin is pulled up to an independent supply \nwhich is present even if the device is unpowered, there can be a small voltage seen on this pin depending on the \npin sink current, which is a function of the pullup supply voltage and resistor. Minimize the sink current to keep \nthis pin voltage low enough not to be detected as a logic HIGH by associated external circuits in this condition.\n8.3.8 Quick Output Discharge (QOD)\nThe TPS25981xx has an integrated output discharge function which can be helpful in quickly removing residual \ncharge left on the large output capacitors and avoids bus floating at some undefined voltage. The internal QOD \npulldown FET on the OUT pin is activated when the EN/UVLO is held low (V EN < V UVLO(F) ). The output discharge \nfunction can result in excess power dissipation inside the device leading to increase in junction temperature. The \noutput discharge is disabled if the junction temperature (T J) crosses the thermal shutdown threshold (TSD) to \navoid long term degradation of the part.\n8.3.9 Reverse Current Blocking FET Driver\nThe TPS259813x variants provide an option to drive an external N-FET for implementing reverse current \nblocking function. The N-FET is connected in series with the eFuse in a common source configuration as shown \nin Figure 8-8 . The gate of the blocking FET is controlled by the DVDT pin of the eFuse. When the eFuse is \nturned ON and operating in steady-state, the DVDT pin is driven high which turns the external FET fully ON to \nprovide a low impedance power path from input to output. When the eFuse turns OFF under any condition, the \nDVDT pin is pulled low and the blocking FET is turned OFF. This ensures there\'s no current path from the output \nto input in the OFF state.\nwww.ti.comTPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\nTPS259813x  IN OUT\nEN/UVLO\nILM dVdt GNDVIN = 2.7 to 16 V\nRILMVOUT\nCOUT\nPG\nFLT\nITIMER\nCDVDT CITIMEREN/OVLOFigure 8-8.

TPS259814x and TPS22811x Connected in Parallel for Higher Steady-State Current Capability\n9.2 Typical Application\nTPS259814x can be used for optical module power rail protection. Optical modules are commonly used in high-\nbandwidth data communication systems such as optical networking equipment, enterprise/data-center switches \nand routers. Several variants of optical modules are available in the market, which differ in the form-factor and \nthe data speed support (Gbit/s). Of these, the popular variant double dense quad small form-factor pluggable \n(QSFP-DD) module supports speeds up to 400 Gbit/s. In addition to the system protection during hot-plug \nevents, the other key requirement for optical module is the tight voltage regulation. The optical module uses \n3.3-V supply and requires voltage regulation within ±5% for proper operation.\nA typical power tree of such system is shown in Figure 9-7 . The optical line card consists of DC-DC converter, \nprotection device (eFuse) and power supply filters. The DC-DC converter steps-down the 12 V to 3.3 V and \nmaintains the 3.3-V rail within ±2 %. The power supply filtering network uses ‘LC’ components to reduce high \nfrequency noise injection into the optical module. The DC resistance of the inductor ‘L’ causes voltage drop \nof around 1.5% which leaves us with a voltage drop budget of just 1.5% (3.3 V × 1.5% = 50 mV) across the \nprotection device. Considering a maximum load current of 5.5 A per module, the maximum ON-resistance of \nthe protection device must be less than 9 m Ω. TPS259814x eFuse offers a very low ON-resistance of 6 m Ω \n(typical), thereby meeting the target specification with additional margin to spare and simplifying the overall \nsystem design.TPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\n www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\nDC-DCVIN\n12V\neFuseIN OUT\nOVLO3.3V\nOptical Line CardHot Plug / UnplugQSFP \nModuleVccTx\nVccRx\nVcc\nModPrsLGNDVOUTFigure 9-7.

Dynamic power stresses often are an order of \nmagnitude greater than the static stresses, so it is important to determine the right start-up time and inrush \ncurrent limit required with system capacitance to avoid thermal shutdown during start-up.\nThe slew rate (SR) needed to achieve the desired output rise time can be calculated as:\nSR \xa0V\nms=V I N \xa0 V\nt R \xa0 ms= \xa03.3 \xa0 V\n2.2 \xa0 m s= 1.5\xa0V\nms\xa0 (9)\nThe C dVdt needed to achieve this slew rate can be calculated as:\nC dV dt \xa0 p F =3300\nSR \xa0V\nms=3300\n1.5\xa0V\nms\xa0 = 2200 \xa0 p F (10)\nChoose the nearest standard capacitor value as 2200 pF.\nFor this slew rate, the inrush current can be calculated as:\nI I NRU S H \xa0 m A = C O UT \xa0 µ F \xa0 × SR \xa0V\nm s= \xa0 10 \xa0µ F \xa0 × \xa0 1.5 \xa0V\nm s\xa0 = 15 \xa0 m A (11)\nThe average power dissipation inside the part during inrush can be calculated as:\nPD I N RU SH \xa0 m W \xa0 = 0.5\xa0 × \xa0 V I N \xa0 V \xa0 × \xa0 I I NRU S H \xa0 m A = \xa00.5 \xa0 × 3.3\xa0 V × 15\xa0 m A = 25 \xa0 m W (12)\nFor the given power dissipation, the thermal shutdown time of the device must be greater than the ramp-up time \ntR to avoid start-up failure. Figure 9-9  shows the thermal shutdown limit, for 0.025 W of power, the shutdown time \nis more than 10 s which is very large as compared to t R = 2.2 ms. Therefore, it is safe to use 2.2 ms as the \nstart-up time for this application.TPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\n www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\nPower Dissipation (W)Time to TSD (ms)\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 1400.111010010001000020000\nFigure 9-9.

TI recommends an \ninput ceramic bypass capacitor higher than 0.1 μF if the input supply is located more than a few inches from \nthe device. The power supply must be rated higher than the set current limit to avoid voltage droops during \novercurrent and short-circuit conditions.\n10.1 Transient Protection\nIn the case of a short-circuit and overload current limit when the device interrupts current flow, the input \ninductance generates a positive voltage spike on the input, and the output inductance generates a negative \nvoltage spike on the output. The peak amplitude of voltage spikes (transients) is dependent on the value of \ninductance in series to the input or output of the device. Such transients can exceed the absolute maximum \nratings of the device if steps are not taken to address the issue. Typical methods for addressing transients \ninclude:\n•Minimize lead length and inductance into and out of the device.\n•Use a large PCB GND plane.\n•Connect a Schottky diode from the OUT pin ground to absorb negative spikes.\n•Connect a low ESR capacitor larger than 1 μF at the OUT pin very close to the device.\n•Use a low-value ceramic capacitor C IN = 1 μF to absorb the energy and dampen the transients. The capacitor \nvoltage rating must be at least twice the input supply voltage to be able to withstand the positive voltage \nexcursion during inductive ringing.\nUse Equation 15  to estimate the approximate value of input capacitance:\nV S PI KE Abs o l u te \xa0 = \xa0 V I N + \xa0 I L O A D \xa0 \xa0 × \xa0L I N\nC I N(15)\nwhere\n–VIN is the nominal supply voltage.\n–ILOAD is the load current.\n–LIN equals the effective inductance seen looking into the source.\n–CIN is the capacitance present at the input.\n•Some applications can require the addition of a Transient Voltage Suppressor (TVS) to prevent transients \nfrom exceeding the absolute maximum ratings of the device. In some cases, even if the maximum amplitude \nof the transients is below the absolute maximum rating of the device, a TVS can help to absorb the excessive \nenergy dump and prevent it from creating very fast transient voltages on the input supply pin of the IC, which \ncan couple to the internal control circuits and cause unexpected behavior.\nFigure 10-1  shows the circuit implementation with optional protection components.\nwww.ti.comTPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 39\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\nTPS25981x IN OUT\nEN/UVLO\nILM dVdt GNDVIN = 2.7 to 16 V\nRILMVOUT\nCOUT\nEN/OVLOPG\nFLT\nITIMER\nCDVDT CITIMERR1\nR2\nR3CIN D1D2 CLOADFigure 10-1.

Care \nmust be taken to minimize the loop area formed by the bypass-capacitor connection, the IN terminal, and the \nGND terminal of the IC.\n•High current-carrying power-path connections must be as short as possible and must be sized to carry at \nleast twice the full-load current.\n•The GND terminal must be tied to the PCB ground plane at the terminal of the IC with the shortest possible \ntrace. The PCB ground must be a copper plane or island on the board. TI recommends to have a separate \nground plane island for the eFuse. This plane does not carry any high currents and serves as a quiet ground \nreference for all the critical analog signals of the eFuse. The device ground plane must be connected to the \nsystem power ground plane using a star connection.\n•The IN and OUT pins are used for heat dissipation. Connect to as much copper area on top and bottom \nPCB layers using as possible with thermal vias. The vias under the device also help to minimize the voltage \ngradient across the IN and OUT pads and distribute current uniformly through the device, which is essential \nto achieve the best on-resistance and current sense accuracy.\n•Locate the following support components close to their connection pins:\n–RILM\n–CdVdT\n–CITIMER\n–Resistors for the EN/UVLO, EN/OVLO pins\n•Connect the other end of the component to the GND pin of the device with shortest trace length. The trace \nrouting for the R ILM, CITIMER  and C dVdt components to the device must be as short as possible to reduce \nparasitic effects on the current limit , overcurrent blanking interval and soft start timing. TI recommends to \nkeep parasitic capacitance on ILM pin below 50 pF to ensure stable operation. These traces must not have \nany coupling to switching signals on the board.\n•Because the bias current on ILM pin directly controls the overcurrent protection behavior of the device, the \nPCB routing of this node must be kept away from any noisy (switching) signals.\n•Protection devices such as TVS, snubbers, capacitors, or diodes must be placed physically close to the \ndevice they are intended to protect. These protection devices must be routed with short traces to reduce \ninductance. For example, TI recommends a protection Schottky diode to address negative transients due to \nswitching of inductive loads. TI also recommends to add a ceramic decoupling capacitor of 1 μF or greater \nbetween OUT and GND. These components must be physically close to the OUT pins. Care must be taken \nto minimize the loop area formed by the Schottky diode, bypass-capacitor connection, the OUT pin, and the \nGND terminal of the IC.\nwww.ti.comTPS25981\nSLVSGG6B – APRIL 2022 – REVISED JUNE 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 41\nProduct Folder Links: TPS25981\n11.2 Layout Example\n6\n59\n3\n42\n8Inner GND layer\nTop Power layer\nINOUT\n10\nINOUTBottom Power layer\n71\nFigure 11-1.
