The \nAD5700/ AD5700- 1 integrate  all of the necessary filtering, signal \ndetection,  modulating, demodulating and signal generation \nfunctions, thus requiring few  external components. The 0.5%  \nprecision internal oscillator on the AD5700- 1 greatly reduces \nthe board space requirements, making it ideal for line- powered \napplications  in both master and slave configurations . The m axi-\nmum supply current consumption is 115  µA, making t he AD5700/  \nAD5700- 1 an optimal choice  for low power  loop -powered applica -\ntions. Transmit waveform s are phase continuous 1200  Hz and  \n2200 Hz sinusoid s. The AD5700/ AD5700 -1 contain accurate \ncarrier detect circuitry and use  a standard UART interface.  \nTable 1.

G | Page 12 of 24 TERMINOLOGY  \nVCC and  IOV CC Current Consumption  \nThis specification gives a summation of the current consump -\ntion of both the V CC and the IOV CC supplies. Figure 11 shows \nseparate measurements for V CC and IOV CC currents vs . varying \ncapacitive loads , in transmit mode.  \nLoad Regulation  \nLoad regulation is the change in reference output voltage due to \na specified change in load current. It is expressed in ppm/ µA. \nCD Assert  \nThe minimum value at which the carrier detect signal  assert s is \n85 mV p-p and the max imum value it assert s at is 110  mV p-p. CD \nis already high (asserted) for HART input signals greater than 110 mV p -p. This sp ecification was set assuming a sinusoi dal \ninput signal containing pre amble characters at the input and  an \nideal external filter (s ee Figure 23). HART_OUT Output Voltage  \nThis is the p eak-to-peak HART_OUT output voltage. The \nspecification in Table 2 was set using a worst -case load of 160 Ω, \nac-coupled with a 2.2  µF capacitor. Figure 17 and Figure 18 show \nHART_OUT output voltages for both resistive and purely capacitive loads.  \nMark/Spac e Frequency  \nA 1.2  kHz signal represents a digital 1 , or mark, whereas  a \n2.2 kHz signal represents a 0 , or space.  \nPhase Continuity Error  \nThe DDS engine in this design inherently generates continuous phase signals, thus avoiding any output discontinuity when  \nswitching between frequencies. This attribute is  desirable for \nsignals that are to be transmitted over a band  limited channel, \nbecause discontinuities in a signal introduce wideband fre -\nquency components.  As the name suggests, for a signal to be \ncontinuous, the phase continuity error must  be 0\no. \n \n \nData Sheet  AD5700/AD5700 -1 \n \nRev. G | Page 13 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nHighwa y Addressable Remote Transducer  (HART)  Communica -\ntion is the global standard for sending and receiving digital \ninformation across analog wires between smart field devices \nand control systems. This is a digital two -way communication \nsystem , in which a 1  mA p- p frequency  shift keyed (FSK) signal \nis modulated on top of a 4 mA to 20 mA analog current signal. \nThe AD5700/ AD5700- 1 are designed and specified to operate \nas a single -chip, low power,  HART  FSK half-duplex modem, \ncomplying with the HART physical layer requirements \n(Revision 8.1).  \nA single -chip solution, the  AD5700/ AD5700- 1 not only inte -\ngrate the modulation and demodulation functions, but also \ncontain an internal reference, an integrated receive band -pass \nfilter (which has the flexibility  of being bypassed if required), \nand an internally buffe red HART output, giving a high output \ndrive capab ility and removing the need for external buffering. \nThe AD5700- 1 option  also contains a precision internal RC \noscillator. The block diagram in Figure 1 shows a graphical \nillustration of how these circuit blocks are connected together. As a result of such extensive integration options, minimal external components are required.  The AD5700/ AD5700- 1  \nare suitable for use in both HART field instrument and master  \nconfigurations.  \nThe AD5700/ AD5700- 1 either transmit or receive  1.2 kHz and \n2.2 kHz carrier signals. A 1.2  kHz signal represents a  digital  1, \nor mark, whereas  a 2.2 kHz signal represents a  0, or space.  \nThere are three main clocking configurations supported by \nthese parts, two of which are available on the AD5700 option, \nwhereas  all three are available on the AD5700- 1 device:  \n• External crystal  \n• CMOS clock i nput  \n• Internal RC o scillator ( AD5700- 1 only ) \nThe device is controlled  via a standard UART interface. The \nrelevant signals are \nRTS, CD, TXD , and RXD (see Table 6 for \nmore detail on individual pin descriptions ). \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n FSK MODULATOR  \nThe modulator converts a bit stream of UART -encoded HART \ndata at the TXD input to a sequence of 1200 Hz and 2200 Hz \ntones (see Figure 19). This sinusoidal signal is internally buff -\nered and output on the HART_OUT pin. The modulator is \nenabled by bringing the RTS signal low.  \n \nFigure 19. AD5700/ AD5700- 1 Modulator Waveform  \nThe modulator block contains a DDS engine that produces a \n1.2 kHz or 2.2  kHz sine wave in digital form  and then perform s \na digital -to-analog conversion. This DDS engine inherently \ngenerates continuous phase signals, thus avoiding any output \ndiscontinuity when switching between frequencies. For more information on DDS fundamentals , see MT-085, Fundamentals \nof Direct Digital Synthesizers (DDS) . Figure 20 demonstrates a \nsimple implementation of this FSK encoding.  \n \nFigure 20.

G | Page 14 of 24 CONNECTING TO HART_O UT \nThe HART_OUT pin is dc biased to 0.75  V and should be \ncapacitively coupled to the load.  The c urrent consumption \nspecifications in Table 2 are based on driving a 5  nF load. If  \nthe application requires a larger load value, more current is  \nrequired. This value can be calculated from the following \nformula:  \nRMS LOAD AD5700 TOTAL I I I +=  \n22\n2124mV500\nLOAD\nLOADRMS LOAD\nRCfI\n+\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n×××=\nπ (1) \nwhere:  \nIAD5700  is the  current drawn by the  AD5700/ AD5700- 1 in \ntransmit mode as per specifications (se e Table 2). Note th at the \nspecifications in Table 2 assume a 5  nF C LOAD.  \nf is the  output frequency (1.2  kHz or  2.2 kHz) . \nCLOAD is the  capacitive load to g round on HART_OUT . \nRLOAD is the r esistive load on the loop.  \nWhen driving a purely capacitive load, the load should be in the \nrange of 5  nF to 52  nF. See Figure 11 for a typical plot of supply \ncurrent vs . capacitive load.  \nExample  \nAssume use of  an internal reference, and CLOAD = 52  n F. \nICC + IOI CC = 14 0 µA max imum  (from Table 2 \nspecification )  \nNote that this is incorporating a 5  nF load.  \nTherefore , to calculate the load current required to drive the \nextra 47  n F,  use Equation 1 .  \nSubstituting f = 1200 Hz, C LOAD = 47  nF, and RLOAD = 0 Ω into \nthe formula results in I LOAD of 31 .3 µA.  \nIf using the crystal oscillator, this adds 60 µA max imum  (see \nTable 2 for conditions).  \nThus, the to tal worst -case current in this example is : \n140 µA + 31 .3 µA + 60 µA = 2 31.3 µA \nIf driving a load with a resistive element, it is recommended to place a 22  nF capacitor to ground at the HART_OUT pin. The \nload should be coupled with a 2.2  µF series capacitor . For low \nimpedance devices, t he R\nLOAD range is typically 230 Ω to 600 Ω. \n \nFigure 21. AD5700/ AD5700- 1 with Resistive Load at HART_OUT  FSK DE MODULATOR  \n \nFigure 22. AD5700/ AD5700- 1 Demodulator Waveform  \n(Preamble Message 0xFF)  \nWhen  RTS is logic high, the modulator is disabled and the \ndemodulator is enabled , that is, the AD5700/ AD5700- 1 are in \nreceive mode. A high on CD indicates a valid carrier is detected. \nThe demodulator accepts an FSK signal at the HART_IN pin \nand restores the original modulated signal at the UART interface digit al data output pin, RXD.  The combination of the \nADC, digital filtering and digital demodulation results in a highly accurate  output on the RXD pin.  The HART bit stream \nfollows a standard UART frame with a start bit, 8-bit data, one  \nparity , and a s top bit  (see Figure 22). \nCONNECTING TO HART_I N OR ADC_IP  \nThe AD5700/ AD5700- 1 have two filter configuration options : \nan external filter (HART signal is applied to ACP_IP) and an \ninternal filter (HART signal is applied to HART_IN).  \nThe external filter configuration is shown in Figure 23. In this \ncase, the HART signal is applied to the ADC_IP pin through an \nexternal filter circuit. In safety critical applications, the  AD5700 / \nAD5700- 1 must be isolated from the high voltage of the loop \nsupply. The recommended external band -pass filter includes a \n150 kΩ resistor, which limits current to a sufficiently low level to adhere to intrinsic safety requirements. In this case, the input \nhas higher transient voltage protection and should, therefore, not require additional protection circuitry, even in the most demanding of industrial environments. Assuming the use of a 1% ac curate resistor and 10%  accurate capacitor compo nents, \nthe calculated variation in CD trip voltage levels vs . the ideal  is \n±3.5 m V. \n \nFigure 23.

AD5700/ AD5700- 1 Using Internal Filter on HART_IN  \nCLOCK CONFIGURATION  \nThe AD5700/ AD5700- 1 support numerous clocking configura -\ntions to allow the optimal trade -off between cost and power :  \n• External crystal  \n• CMOS clock input  \n• Internal RC oscillator ( AD5700- 1 only ) \nThe CLK_CFG0, CLK_CFG1, and X TAL_ E N  pins configur e \nthe clock generation as shown in Table 7. The  AD5700/ AD5700- 1 \ncan also provide a clock output at CLKOUT ( for more details , \nsee the  CLKOUT  section).  \nExternal Crystal  \nThe typical conne ctio n for an external  crystal (ABLS -3.6864MHZ -\nL4Q -T) is shown in Figure 25. To ensure minimum current \nconsumption and to minimize stray capacitances, connections \nbetween the crystal, capacitors , and ground should be made as \nclose to the AD5700/ AD5700- 1 as possible.  Consult individual \ncrystal vendors for recommended load information and crystal \nperformance specifications.  \n \nFigure 25. Crystal Oscillator  Connection \nThe ABLS -3.6864MHZ -L4Q -T crystal oscillator data  sheet \nrecommended two 36  pF capacitors. Because  the crystal current \nconsumption is dominated by the load capacitance, in an effort to reduce the cryst al current consumption, two 16 pF capacitors \nwere  used on the X TAL1  and XTAL2 pins. T he AD5700 /AD5700- 1 \nstill functioned as expected , even with the resulting  reduction in \nfrequency performance  from the crystal due to the smaller \ncapacitance values.  Crystals are available that support 16 pF \ncapacitors . It is recommended to consult the relevant  crystal \nmanufac turers for this information . CMOS Clock Input  \nA CMOS clock input can also be used to generate a clock for the AD5700/ AD5 700- 1. To use this mode, connect an external \nclock source to the XTAL 1 pin , and leave XTAL2 open  circuit \n(see Figure 26).  \n \nFigure 26. CMOS  Clock C onnection \nInternal Oscillator ( AD5700 -1 only)  \nConsuming typically 218  µA, the low power , internal , 0.5 % \nprecision RC oscillator, avail able only on the AD5700- 1, has an \noscillation frequency of 1.2288 MHz. To use this mode, tie the \nXTAL1 pin to ground and leave the XTAL2 pin  open  circuit \n(see Figure 27). \n \nFigure 27. Internal Oscillator Connection  \nCLKOUT  \nThe AD5700/ AD5700- 1 can provide  a clock output  at CLKOUT \n(see Table 7).  \n• If using the crystal oscillator, this clock output can be configured as a 3.6864 MHz, 1.8432 MHz , or 1.2288  MHz \nbuffer clock.  \n• If using a CMOS clock, no clock output can be configured \nat th e CLKOUT pin.   \n• If using the internal RC oscillator, this clock output is only \navailable as a 1.2288 MHz buffer clock.  \nThe amplitude of the  clock ou tput depends on the IOV\nCC level; \nthere fore, the clock output  can be in the range of 1.71 V p-p to \n5.5 V p-p. Enabling the clock output of the AD5700/ AD5700- 1 \nincrease s the current consumption of  the device. This increase \nis due to the current required to d rive any load at the CLKOUT \npin, which should not be more than  30 pF.  \nThis capacitance should be minimized to reduce current \nconsumption and provide  the clock with the cleanest edges.  \nThe additional current draw n from the IOV CC supply can be \ncalculated using the following equation:  \nI = C × V × f  \n 10435-021HART\nNETWORK\n680pF2.2nFHART_OUT\nHART_IN\nADC_IPAD5700/\nAD5700-1\n10435-022ABLS-3-6864MHZ-L4Q-T\n36pF 36pF\nXTAL1\nXTAL2\nAD5700/AD5700-1\n10435-027XTAL1\nXTAL2\nAD5700/AD5700-1\n10435-028XTAL1\nXTAL2\nAD5700-1\nAD5700/AD 5700-1  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

This specification is given for a \nmax imum  temperature of 85oC (115 µA receive current and \n140 µA transmit current) and an extended maximum  \ntemperature of 125oC (179 µA receive current and  193 µA \ntransmit current). Alternatively, if the external reference is \npreferred, (assuming a max imum  temperature  of 85oC), the \nreceive and transmit supply cu rrent values become 118 µA and \n129 µA respectively, including the current required by the external reference. A similar calculation can be done for the 125\noC max imum  temperature case.  \nIf the crystal oscillator o r internal oscillator is used , VCC and \nIOV CC current consumption figures return  to the 115 µA receive \ncurrent and  140 µA transmit current . However,  the resultant \ncurrent consumption from the crystal oscillator or internal oscil lator must now be accounted f or, 60 µA max imum  addi-\ntional current for the crystal oscillator , or 285 µA max imum  \nadditional current for the internal oscillator option. This gives  \na maximum current consumption of 175 µA in receive mode and 200 µA in transmit mode, when using the internal reference \nand the crystal oscillator. Utilizing the internal reference  \nand the internal oscillator ( AD5700- 1 only) results in a total \nmaximum current consumption of 400 µA for receive current and 425 µA for transmit current.  POWER -DOWN MODE  \nThe AD5700/ AD5700- 1 can be placed in to power -down mode \nby holding the RESET  pin  low.  If using  the internal reference,  it \nis recommended  to tie the REF _EN  pin to the RESET  pin so \nthat it is also power ed down. If the reference is not powered \ndown while RESET  is low , the output voltage on the REF pin is  \napproximately 1.7  V until  RESET  is brought high again.  \nIn this mode , the receive, transmit , and oscillator circuits are all \nswitched off , and the device consumes a typical current of 16  µA. \nFULL DUPLEX O PERATION  \nFull duplex operation means that the modulator an d demodula -\ntor of the AD5700/ AD5700- 1 are enabled at the same time. This \nis a powerful feature, enabling a self -test procedure of not only \nthe HART device but also  the complete signal path between the \nHART device and the host controller. This provides verification that the  local co mmunications loop is functional. This increased \nlevel of system diagnostics is useful in production self -test and \nis advantageous in improving the application’s safety i ntegrity \nlevel (SIL) rating.

For many \napplications, 1 μF in parallel with 0.1 μF ceramic capacitors to ground should be sufficient. The REG_CAP voltage of 1.8 V is \nused to supply the AD5700/ AD5700-1 internal circuitry and is \nderived from the V\nCC supply using a high efficiency clocking \nLDO. Decouple this REG_CAP supply with a 1 μF ceramic \ncapacitor to ground. It is also required to decouple the REF pin with a 1 μF ceramic capacitor to ground. Place decoupling \ncapacitors as close to the relevant pins as possible. \nFor loop-powered applications, it is recommended to connect a \nresistance in series with the V\nCC supply to minimize the effect of \nany noise, which may, depending on the system configuration, be introduced onto the loop as a result of current draw variations from the AD5700/ AD5700-1 . For typical applications, 470 Ω of \nresistance has proven most effective. However, depending on the application conditions, alternative values may also be acceptable (see R1 in Figure 31). \nTRANSIENT VOLTAGE PROTECTION \nMany industrial control applications have requirements for \nHART-enabled current input and output modules. Figure 28 shows an example of a HART-enabled current input module \nthat contains transient voltage protection circuitry, which is \nvery important in harsh industrial control environments. \nThe module is powered from a 24 V field supply, and the 250 Ω \nload is within the low impedance module itself. This configuration is in contrast to Figure 29, which demonstrates a secondary HART \ndevice, in which the load is outside of the module. For transient \nvoltage protection, a 10 V unidirectional (for protection against positive high voltage transients) transient voltage suppressor (TVS) is placed at the connection point of the current input module. The TVS component that is used in a given application circuit \nmust have power ratings that are appropriate to the individual \nsystem. When choosing the TVS, low leakage current is also an important specification for maintaining the accuracy of the analog current input. In the event of a transient spike, the 22 Ω series resistor acts as a current limiting resistor for the FSK output pin. The FSK input pin is inherently protected by the 150 kΩ resistor, \nwhich forms part of the recommended external filter circuitry \nat the FSK input. The voltage divider, made up of both a 75 kΩ resistor and a 22 kΩ resistor, is used to maintain a 0.75 V dc bias at the field side of the FSK output switch. \n  \nFigure 28.

G | Page 18 of 24 As previously mentioned, Figure 29 shows an example secondary  \nHART device, incorporating two -stage protection circuitry. In \nthis example, a bidirectional (for protection against both positive  \nand negative high voltage transien ts) TVS  is included to provide \nflexibility in the polarity of the connection points of the module.  \nBecause this module could be connected to any point on the \ncurrent loop, the higher TVS rating was chosen. The lower  rated  second stage provides added protection for the AD5700/  \nAD5700- 1 device.  \nTYPICAL CONNECTION D IAGRAMS  \nFigure 30 shows a typical connection diagram for the AD5700/  \nAD5700- 1 using the external and internal options. See the \nConnecting to HART_IN or ADC_IP  section for more details.  \nThe AD5700/ AD5700- 1 are designed to interface easily with \nAnalog Devices, Inc., innovative portfolio of industrial \nconverters like the AD5421 loop -powered current -output DAC, \nthe AD5410/ AD5420 and AD5412/ AD5422 family of line -\npowered current -output DACs, and the AD5755- 1, a quad DAC \nwith innovative dynamic power control  technology. The combination of Analog Devices industrial converters and the \nAD5700/ AD5700- 1 greatly simplifies system d esign, enhancing \nreliability while reducing overall PCB size.  \nFigure 31 shows how the AD5700/ AD5700- 1 HART modem \ncan be interfaced with the AD5421  (4 mA to 20 mA loop -powered \nDAC) and the ADuCM360  microcontroller to construct a loop \npowered transmit ter circuit. The HART signal from \nHART_OUT is introduced to the AD5421 via the C IN pin.  \nThe HART enabled smart transmitter reference demo circuit (the block diagram shown in Figure 32) was developed by \nAnalog Devices and uses the  AD5421, a 16 -bit, loop -powered, \n4 mA to 20 mA DAC, the ADuCM360 microcontroller and the \nAD5700 modem. This circuit has been compliance tested,  \nverified, and registered as an approved HART solution by the HART Communication Foundation.
