This efficiency is achieved through highly integrated packaging technology\nand the implementation of a custom power stage and control device. The DCP02 devices are specified for\noperational isolation only.

Typically, this\nisolation is defined as the use of insulated wire in the construction of the transformer as the primary isolation\nbarrier. The hipot one-second duration test (dielectric voltage, withstand test) is a production test used to verify\nthat the isolation barrier is functioning. Products with operational isolation should never be used as an element in\na safety-isolation system.\n7.3.1.2 Basic or Enhanced Isolation\nBasic or enhanced isolation is defined by specified creepage and clearance limits between the primary and\nsecondary circuits of the power supply. Basic isolation is the use of an isolation barrier in addition to the\ninsulated wire in the construction of the transformer. Input and output circuits must also be physically separated\nby specified distances.\n7.3.1.3 Continuous Voltage\nFor a device that has no specific safety agency approvals (operational isolation), the continuous voltage that can\nbe applied across the part in normal operation is less than 42.5 V RMS or 60 V DC. Ensure that both input and\noutput voltages maintain normal SELV limits. The isolation test voltage represents a measure of immunity to\ntransient voltages.\nWARNING\nDo not use the device as an element of a safety isolation system that exceeds the SELV limit.\nIf the device is expected to function correctly with more than 42.5 V RMS or 60 V DC applied continuously across\nthe isolation barrier, then the circuitry on both sides of the barrier must be regarded as operating at an unsafe\nvoltage, and further isolation or insulation systems must form a barrier between these circuits and any user-\naccessible circuitry according to safety standard requirements.\n7.3.1.4 Isolation Voltage\nHipot test , flash-tested , withstand voltage , proof voltage , dielectric withstand voltage , and isolation test voltage\nare all terms that relate to the same thing: a test voltage applied for a specified time across a component\ndesigned to provide electrical isolation to verify the integrity of that isolation. TI’s DCP02 series of dc-dc\nconverters are all 100% production tested at 1.0 kV AC for one second.\n7.3.1.5 Repeated High-Voltage Isolation Testing\nRepeated high-voltage isolation testing of a barrier component can degrade the isolation capability, depending\non materials, construction, and environment. The DCP02 series of dc-dc converters have toroidal, enameled,\nwire isolation transformers with no additional insulation between the primary and secondary windings. While a\ndevice can be expected to withstand several times the stated test voltage, the isolation capability depends on\nthe wire insulation. Any material, including this enamel (typically polyurethane), is susceptible to eventual\nchemical degradation when subject to very-high applied voltages. Therefore, strictly limit the number of high-\nvoltage tests and repeated high-voltage isolation testing. However, if it is absolutely required, reduce the voltage\nby 20% from specified test voltage with a duration limit of one second per test.www.ti.comDCP020503, DCP020505, DCP020507, DCP020509, DCP020515D, DCP021205, DCP021212,\nDCP021212D, DCP021515, DCP022405, DCP022405D, DCP022415D\nSBVS011N – MARCH 2000 – REVISED APRIL 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: DCP020503  DCP020505  DCP020507  DCP020509  DCP020515D  DCP021205\nDCP021212  DCP021212D  DCP021515  DCP022405  DCP022405D  DCP022415D\n7.3.2 Power Stage\nThe DCP02 series of devices use a push-pull, center-tapped topology. The DCP02 devices switch at 400 kHz\n(divide-by-2 from an 800-kHz oscillator).\n7.3.3 Oscillator And Watchdog Circuit\nThe onboard, 800-kHz oscillator generates the switching frequency via a divide-by-2 circuit. The oscillator can be\nsynchronized to other DCP02-series device circuits or an external source, and is used to minimize system noise.\nA watchdog circuit checks the operation of the oscillator circuit. The oscillator can be disabled by pulling the\nSYNC pin low. When the SYNC pin goes low, the output pins transition into tri-state mode, which occurs within\n2 μs.\n7.3.4 Thermal Shutdown\nThe DCP02 series of devices are protected by a thermal-shutdown circuit.\nIf the on-chip temperature rises above 150°C, the device shuts down. Normal operation resumes as soon as the\ntemperature falls below 150°C.\n7.3.5 Synchronization\nIn the event that more than one DC/DC converter is needed onboard, beat frequencies and other electrical\ninterference can be generated. This interference occurs because of the small variations in switching frequencies\nbetween the DC/DC converters.\nThe DCP02 series of devices overcome this interference by allowing devices to be synchronized to one another.\nUp to eight devices can be synchronized by connecting the SYNC pins together, taking care to minimize the\ncapacitance of tracking. Stray capacitance (greater than 3 pF) has the effect of reducing the switching frequency,\nor even stopping the oscillator circuit. The maximum recommended voltage applied to the SYNC pin is 3.0 V.\nFor an application that uses more than eight synchronized devices use an external device to drive the SYNC\npins. The application report External Synchronization of the DCP01/02 Series of DC/DC Converters  describes\nthis configuration.\nNote\nDuring the start-up period, all synchronized devices draw maximum current from the input\nsimultaneously. If the input voltage falls below approximately 4 V, the devices may not start up.\nA 2.2-μF capacitor should be connected close to each device\'s input pin.\n7.3.6 Light Load Operation (< 10%)\nOperation below 10% load can cause the output voltage to increase up to double the typical output voltage. For\napplications that operate less than 10% of rated output current, it is recommended to add a minimum load to\nensure the output voltage of the device is within the load regulation range. For example, connect a 125-Ω pre-\nload resistor to meet the 10% minimum load condition for the DCP020505P.\n7.3.7 Load Regulation (10% to 100%)\nThe load regulation of the DCP02 series of devices is specified at 10% to 100% load placing a minimum 10%\nload will ensure the output voltage is within the range specified in the Section 6.5  table. For more information\nregarding operation below 10% load, see the Section 7.3.6  section.\n7.3.8 Construction\nThe basic construction of the DCP02 series of devices is the same as standard integrated circuits. The molded\npackage contains no substrate. The DCP02 series of devices are constructed using an IC, rectifier diodes, and a\nwound magnetic toroid on a leadframe. Because the package contains no solder, the devices do not require any\nspecial printed circuit board (PCB) assembly processing. This architecture results in an isolated DC/DC\nconverter with inherently high reliability.DCP020503, DCP020505, DCP020507, DCP020509, DCP020515D, DCP021205, DCP021212, DCP021212D,\nDCP021515, DCP022405, DCP022405D, DCP022415D\nSBVS011N – MARCH 2000 – REVISED APRIL 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DCP020503  DCP020505  DCP020507  DCP020509  DCP020515D  DCP021205\nDCP021212  DCP021212D  DCP021515  DCP022405  DCP022405D  DCP022415D\n7.3.9 Thermal Management\nDue to the high power density of this device, it is advisable to provide ground planes on the input and output.\n7.3.10 Power-Up Characteristics\nThe DCP02 series of devices do not include a soft-start feature. Therefore, a high in-rush current during power\nup is expected. To ensure a more stable start-up, allow the input voltage to be in regulation before enabling the\ndevice. Refer to the Section 7.4.1  section on how to disable/enable the device. Figure 7-6  shows the typical\nstart-up waveform for a DCP020505P when enabled after the input voltage is in regulation. Figure 7-3  shows the\ntypical start-up waveform for a DCP020505P, operating from a 5-V input with no load on the output. Figure 7-4\nshows the start-up waveform for a DCP020505P starting up into a 10% load. Figure 7-5  shows the start-up\nwaveform into a full (100%) load.\nFigure 7-3.

If the SYNC pin is pulled low, the DCP02 becomes disabled. The disable time depends upon the\nexternal loading. The internal disable function is implemented in 2 μs. Removal of the pull down causes the\nDCP02 to be enabled.\nCapacitive loading on the SYNC pin should be minimized (≤ 3 pF) in order to prevent a reduction in the oscillator\nfrequency. The application report External Synchronization of the DCP01/02 Series of DC/DC Converters\ndescribes disable/enable control circuitry.\n7.4.2 Decoupling\n7.4.2.1 Ripple Reduction\nThe high switching frequency of 400 kHz allows simple filtering. To reduce ripple, it is recommended that a\nminimum of 1-μF capacitor be used on the V OUT pin. For dual output devices, decouple both of the outputs to the\nCOM pin. A 2.2-μF capacitor on the input is also recommended.\n7.4.2.2 Connecting the DCP02 in Series\nMultiple DCP02 isolated 2W DC/DC converters can be connected in series to provide non-standard voltage rails.\nThis configuration is possible by using the floating outputs provided by the galvanic isolation of the DCP02.\nConnect the +V OUT from one DCP02 to the –V OUT of another (see Figure 7-7 ). If the SYNC pins are tied\ntogether, the self-synchronization feature of the DCP02 prevents beat frequencies on the voltage rails. The\nSYNC feature of the DCP02 allows easy series connection without external filtering, thus minimizing cost.\nThe outputs of a dual-output DCP02 can also be connected in series to provide two times the magnitude of\nVOUT, as shown in Figure 7-8 . For example, connect a dual-output, 15-V, DCP022415D device to provide a 30-V\nrail.\nAll 5-V, 12-V, and 15-V input voltage designs require a 2.2-μF, low-ESR ceramic input capacitor, while 24-V input\napplications require only 0.47 μF of input capacitance.\nVIN \nCOUT \n1.0 µF DCP 02 +VS\nSYNC \n–VS+VOUT1\n–VOUT1\nCOUT \n1.0 µF DCP 02 VS\nSYNC \n–VS+VOUT2\n–VOUT2CIN CIN \nVOUT1\n+ \nVOUT2\nFigure 7-7.

Load Regulation\n8.2.4 PCB Design\nThe copper losses (resistance and inductance) can be minimized by the use of mutual ground and power planes\n(tracks) where possible. If that is not possible, use wide tracks to reduce the losses. If several devices are being\npowered from a common power source, a star-connected system for the track must be deployed; devices must\nnot be connected in series, as this will cascade the resistive losses. The position of the decoupling capacitors is\nimportant. They must be as close to the devices as possible in order to reduce losses. See the PCB Layout\nsection for more details.\n8.2.5 Decoupling Ceramic Capacitors\nAll capacitors have losses because of internal equivalent series resistance (ESR), and to a lesser degree,\nequivalent series inductance (ESL). Values for ESL are not always easy to obtain. However, some\nmanufacturers provide graphs of frequency versus capacitor impedance. These graphs typically show the\ncapacitor impedance falling as frequency is increased (as shown in Figure 8-4 ). In Figure 8-4 , XC is the\nreactance due to the capacitance, X L is the reactance due to the ESL, and f 0 is the resonant frequency. As the\nfrequency increases, the impedance stops decreasing and begins to rise. The point of minimum impedance\nindicates the resonant frequency of the capacitor. This frequency is where the components of capacitance and\ninductance reactance are of equal magnitude. Beyond this point, the capacitor is not effective as a capacitor.\nFrequency (Hz)Capacitor Impedance ( \x9f )\nf0XC\nXL\n0Z\nFigure 8-4. Capacitor Impedance versus Frequency\nAt f0, XC = X L; however, there is a 180° phase difference resulting in cancellation of the imaginary component.\nThe resulting effect is that the impedance at the resonant point is the real part of the complex impedance;\nnamely, the value of the ESR. The resonant frequency must be well above the 800-kHz switching frequency of\nthe DCP and DCVs.www.ti.comDCP020503, DCP020505, DCP020507, DCP020509, DCP020515D, DCP021205, DCP021212,\nDCP021212D, DCP021515, DCP022405, DCP022405D, DCP022415D\nSBVS011N – MARCH 2000 – REVISED APRIL 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: DCP020503  DCP020505  DCP020507  DCP020509  DCP020515D  DCP021205\nDCP021212  DCP021212D  DCP021515  DCP022405  DCP022405D  DCP022415D\nThe effect of the ESR is to cause a voltage drop within the capacitor. The value of this voltage drop is simply the\nproduct of the ESR and the transient load current, as shown in Equation 1 .\nVIN = V PK – (ESR × I TR) (1)\nwhere\n• V IN is the voltage at the device input\n• V PK is the maximum value of the voltage on the capacitor during charge\n• I TR is the transient load current\nThe other factor that affects the performance is the value of the capacitance. However, for the input and the full\nwave outputs (single-output voltage devices), ESR is the dominant factor.\n8.2.6 Input Capacitor and the Effects of ESR\nIf the input decoupling capacitor is not ceramic (and has an ESR greater than  20 mΩ), then at the instant the\npower transistors switch on, the voltage at the input pins falls momentarily. If the voltage falls below\napproximately 4 V, the DCP detects an undervoltage condition and switches the DCP drive circuits to the off\nstate. This detection is carried out as a precaution against a genuine low input voltage condition that could slow\ndown or even stop the internal circuits from operating correctly. A slow-down or stoppage results in the drive\ntransistors being turned on too long, causing saturation of the transformer and destruction of the device.\nFollowing detection of a low input voltage condition, the device switches off the internal drive circuits until the\ninput voltage returns to a safe value, at which time the device tries to restart. If the input capacitor is still unable\nto maintain the input voltage, shutdown recurs. This process repeats until the input capacitor charges sufficiently\nto start the device correctly.\nNormal start-up should occur in approximately 1 ms after power is applied to the device. If a considerably longer\nstart-up duration time is encountered, it is likely that either (or both) the input supply or the capacitors are not\nperforming adequately.\nFor 5-V to 15-V input devices, a 2.2-μF, low-ESR ceramic capacitor ensures a good start-up performance. For\n24-V input voltage devices, 0.47 μF ceramic capacitors are recommended. Tantalum capacitors are not\nrecommended, since most do not have low-ESR values and will degrade performance. If tantalum capacitors\nmust be used, close attention must be paid to both the ESR and voltage as derated by the vendor.\nNote\nDuring the start-up period, these devices may draw maximum current from the input supply. If\nthe input voltage falls below approximately 4 V, the devices may not start up. Connect a 2.2-μF\nceramic capacitor close to the input pins.\n8.2.7 Ripple and Noise\nA good quality, low-ESR ceramic capacitor placed as close as practical across the input reduces reflected ripple\nand ensures a smooth startup.\nA good quality, low-ESR ceramic capacitor placed as close as practical across the rectifier output terminal and\noutput ground gives the best ripple and noise performance. See application report DC-to-DC Converter Noise\nReduction  for more information on noise rejection.\n8.2.7.1 Output Ripple Calculation Example\nThe following example shows that increasing the capacitance has a much smaller effect on the output ripple\nvoltage than does reducing the value of the ESR for the filter capacitor.\nTo calculate the output ripple for a DCP020505 device:\n• V OUT = 5 V\n• I OUT = 0.4 A\n• At full output power, the load resistor is 12.5 ΩDCP020503, DCP020505, DCP020507, DCP020509, DCP020515D, DCP021205, DCP021212, DCP021212D,\nDCP021515, DCP022405, DCP022405D, DCP022415D\nSBVS011N – MARCH 2000 – REVISED APRIL 2020 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DCP020503  DCP020505  DCP020507  DCP020509  DCP020515D  DCP021205\nDCP021212  DCP021212D  DCP021515  DCP022405  DCP022405D  DCP022415D\n• Output capacitor of 1 μF, ESR of 0.1 Ω\n• Capacitor discharge time 1% of 800-kHz (ripple frequency)\ntDIS = 0.0125 μs\nτ = C × R LOAD\nτ = 1 × 10-6 × 12.5 = 12.5 μs\nVDIS = V O(1 – EXP(–t DIS / τ))\nVDIS = 5 mV\nBy contrast, the voltage dropped because of ESR:\nVESR = ILOAD × ESR\nVESR = 40 mV\nRipple voltage = 45 mV\n8.2.8 Dual DCP02 Output Voltage\nThe voltage output for dual DCP02 devices is half wave rectified; therefore, the discharge time is 1.25 μs.\nRepeating the above calculations using the 100% load resistance of 25 Ω (0.2 A per output), the results are:\nτ = 25 μs\ntDIS = 1.25 μs\nVDIS = 244 mV\nVESR = 20 mV\nRipple Voltage = 266 mV\nThis time, it is the capacitor discharging that contributes to the largest component of ripple. Changing the output\nfilter to 10 μF, and repeating the calculations, the result is:\nRipple Voltage = 45 mV\nThis value is composed of almost equal components.\nThe previous calculations are offered as a guideline only. Capacitor parameters usually have large tolerances\nand can be susceptible to environmental conditions.\n8.2.9 Optimizing Performance\nOptimum performance can only be achieved if the device is correctly supported. The very nature of a switching\nconverter requires power to be instantly available when it switches on. If the converter has DMOS switching\ntransistors, the fast edges will create a high current demand on the input supply. This transient load placed on\nthe input is supplied by the external input decoupling capacitor, thus maintaining the input voltage. Therefore, the\ninput supply does not see this transient (this is an analogy to high-speed digital circuits). The positioning of the\ncapacitor is critical and must be placed as close as possible to the input pins and connected by a low-impedance\npath.\nThe optimum performance primarily depends on two factors:\n• Connection of the input and output circuits for minimal loss.\n• The ability of the decoupling capacitors to maintain the input and output voltages at a constant level.\nPower Supply Recommendations\nThe DCP02 is a switching power supply, and as such can place high peak current demands on the input supply.\nIn order to avoid the supply falling momentarily during the fast switching pulses, ground and power planes must\nbe used to connect the power to the input of DCP02. If this connection is not possible, then the supplies must be\nconnected in a star formation with the traces made as wide as possible.www.ti.comDCP020503, DCP020505, DCP020507, DCP020509, DCP020515D, DCP021205, DCP021212,\nDCP021212D, DCP021515, DCP022405, DCP022405D, DCP022415D\nSBVS011N – MARCH 2000 – REVISED APRIL 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: DCP020503  DCP020505  DCP020507  DCP020509  DCP020515D  DCP021205\nDCP021212  DCP021212D  DCP021515  DCP022405  DCP022405D  DCP022415D\n8 Layout\n8.1 Layout Guidelines\nDue to the high power density of these devices, provide ground planes on the input and output.\nFigure 8-4  and Figure 8-2  illustrate a printed circuit board (PCB) layout for the two conventional (DCP01/02,\nDCV01), and two SOP surface-mount packages (DCP02U). Figure 8-1  shows the schematic.\nIncluding input power and ground planes provides a low-impedance path for the input power. For the output, the\nCOM signal connects via a ground plane, while the connections for the positive and negative voltage outputs\nconduct through wide traces in order to minimize losses.\nThe output should be taken from the device using ground and power planes, thereby ensuring minimum losses.\nThe location of the decoupling capacitors in close proximity to their respective pins ensures low losses due to the\neffects of stray inductance, thus improving the ripple performance. This location is of particular importance to the\ninput decoupling capacitor, because this capacitor supplies the transient current associated with the fast\nswitching waveforms of the power drive circuits.\nAllow the unused SYNC pin, to remain configured as a floating pad. It is advisable to place a guard ring\n(connected to input ground) or annulus connected around this pin to avoid any noise pick up. When connecting a\nSYNC pin to one or more SYNC design the linking trace to be short and narrow to avoid stray capacitance.\nEnsure that no other trace is in close proximity to this trace SYNC trace to decrease the stray capacitance on\nthis pin. The stray capacitance affects the performance of the oscillator.\n8.2 Layout Example\n+VS\n–VS\nDCP02xxxxP \n+VOUT \n–VOUT 1\n2\n6\n7C1\nC2\nCOM 5\nC4C2-1\nC4-1C3\nC5R1\nR214 SYNC JP1 VS1\n0V1\n+V1\nCOM1\n– V1\n+VS\n–VS\nDCP02xxxxP \n+VOUT \n–VOUT 1\n2\n6\n7C6\nC7\nCOM 5\nC9C7-1\nC9-1C8\nC10 R3\nR414 SYNC JP2 VS2\n0V2\n+V2\nCOM2\n– V2CON1\nCON2\nFigure 8-1.
