The constant \nfrequency current mode architecture allows a phase-lockable frequency of up to 400kHz. With a wide 4V to \n30V (36V maximum) input and output range and seamless transfers between operating modes, the LTC3780 is ideal \nfor automotive, telecom and battery-powered systems.\nThe operating mode of the controller is determined through \nthe FCB pin. For boost operation, the FCB mode pin can select among Burst Mode\n® operation, discontinuous mode \nand forced continuous mode. During buck operation, the FCB mode pin can select among skip-cycle mode, discon -\ntinuous mode and forced continuous mode. Burst Mode operation and skip-cycle mode provide high efficiency operation at light loads while forced continuous mode \nand discontinuous mode operate at a constant frequency\n. \nFault protection is provided by an output overvoltage comparator and internal foldback current limiting. A power good output pin indicates when the output is within 7.5% of its designed set point.\nHigh Efficiency Buck-Boost Convertern Single Inductor Architecture Allows V IN Above, \nBelow or Equal to V OUT\nn Wide V IN Range: 4V to 36V Operation\nn Synchronous Rectification: Up to 98% Efficiency\nn Current Mode Control\nn ±1% Output V oltage Accuracy: 0.8V < V OUT < 30V\nn Phase-Lockable Fixed Frequency: 200kHz to 400kHz\nn Power Good Output Voltage Monitor\nn Internal LDO for MOSFET Supply\nn Quad N-Channel MOSFET Synchronous Drive\nn VOUT Disconnected from V IN During Shutdown\nn Adjustable Soft-Start Current Ramping\nn Foldback Output Current Limiting\nn Selectable Low Current Modes\nn Output Overvoltage Protection\nn Available in 24-Lead SSOP and Exposed Pad \n (5\nmm × 5mm) 32-Lead QFN Packages\nn Automotive Systems\nn Telecom Systems\nn DC Power Distribution Systems\nn High Power Battery-Operated Devices\nn Industrial Control\n+\nVIN\nTG2\n0.1µF 0.1µF\nBOOST2\nSW2\nBG2TG1\nBOOST1\nSW1\nBG1\nPLLIN\nRUN\nVOSENSEITH\nSS\nSGND FCB\n0.010/uni03A94.7µF\nA\nBD\nC\n2200pF1µF\nCER100µF16VCER 330µF16V\nON/OFF\n0.1µF\n4.7µH20kPGOOD\nL TC3780INTV\nCC\nSENSE+SENSE–PGND7.5k1%\n3780 TA01105k\n1%22µF50VCERV\nIN\n5V TO 32VVOUT\n12V5A+\nVIN (V)0EFFICIENCY (%)POWER LOSS (W)\n9095100\n15 25\n3780 TA01b85\n80\n5 10 20 30 3575\n708910\n7\n6\n5\n4321\n0Efficiency and Power Loss\nVOUT = 12V, I LOAD = 5AAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

The L TC proprietary topology and control architecture em -\nploys a current-sensing resistor in buck or boost modes. The sensed inductor current is controlled by the voltage on the I\nTH pin, which is the output of the amplifier EA. The \nVOSENSE  pin receives the voltage feedback signal, which \nis compared to the internal reference voltage by the EA. \nThe top MOSFET drivers are biased from floating boost -\nstrap capacitors C A and C B (Figure 11), which are normally \nrecharged through an external diode when the top MOSFET \nis turned off. Schottky diodes across the synchronous switch D and synchronous switch B are not required, but provide a lower drop during the dead time. The addition of the Schottky diodes will typically improve peak efficiency by 1% to 2% at 400kHz.\nThe main control loop is shut down by pulling the RUN \npin low. When the RUN pin voltage is higher than 1.5V, an internal 1.2µA current source charges soft-start capacitor C\nSS at the SS pin. The I TH voltage is then clamped to the \nSS voltage while C SS is slowly charged during start-up. \nThis “soft-start” clamping prevents abrupt current from being drawn from the input power supply. \nPOWER SWITCH CONTROL\nFigure 1 shows a simplified diagram of how the four \npower switches are connected to the inductor , V\nIN, VOUT \nand GND. Figure 2 shows the regions of operation for the LTC3780 as a function of duty cycle D. The power switches are properly controlled so the transfer between modes is continuous. When V\nIN approaches V OUT, the buck-boost \nregion is reached; the mode-to-mode transition time is typically 200ns.\nBuck Region (V\nIN > V OUT)\nSwitch D is always on and switch C is always off during \nthis mode. At the start of every cycle, synchronous switch B is turned on first. Inductor current is sensed when synchronous switch B is turned on. After the sensed in -\nductor current falls below the reference voltage, which is proportional to V\nITH, synchronous switch B is turned off and switch A is turned on for the remainder of the cycle. switches A and B will alternate, behaving like a typical synchronous buck regulator . The duty cycle of switch A increases until the maximum duty cycle of the converter in buck mode reaches D\nMAX_BUCK , given by:\n DMAX_BUCK  = 100% – D BUCK-BOOST  \nwhere D BUCK-BOOST  = duty cycle of the buck-boost switch \nrange:\n DBUCK-BOOST  = (200ns • f) • 100%\nand f is the operating frequency in Hz.\nFigure 3 shows typical buck mode waveforms.

In boost mode, switch A is always on. switch C and synchronous switch D are alternately turned on to maintain the output voltage independent of direction of inductor current. Every ten cycles, switch A is forced off for about 300ns to allow boost capacitor C\nA (Figure 13) to \nLTC3780\n15\nRev G For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nrecharge. In buck mode, synchronous switch D is always \non. switch A and synchronous switch B are alternately turned on to maintain the output voltage independent of direction of inductor current. Every ten cycles, synchro -\nnous switch D is forced off for about 300ns to allow C\nB \nto recharge. This is the least efficient operating mode at light load, but may be desirable in certain applications. In this mode, the output can source or sink current.\nWhen the FCB pin voltage is below V\nINTVCC  – 1V, but greater \nthan 0.8V, the controller enters Burst Mode operation in \nboost operation or enters skip-cycle mode in buck opera -\ntion. During boost operation, Burst Mode operation sets a minimum output \ncurrent level before inhibiting the switch \nC and turns off synchronous switch D when the inductor current goes negative. This combination of requirements will, at low currents, force the I\nTH pin below a voltage \nthreshold that will temporarily inhibit turn-on of power switches C and D until the output voltage drops. There is 100mV of hysteresis in the burst comparator tied to the I\nTH pin. This hysteresis produces output signals to the \nMOSFETs C and D that turn them on for several cycles, followed by a variable “sleep” interval depending upon the \nload current. The maximum output voltage ripple is limited to 3% of the nominal DC output voltage as determined by a resistive feedback divider . During buck operation at no load, switch A is turned on for its minimum on-time.  This will not occur every clock cycle when the output load current drops below 1% of the maximum designed load.  The body diode of synchronous switch B or the Schottky diode, which is in parallel with switch B, is used to dis -\ncharge the inductor current; switch B only turns on every ten clock cycles to allow C\nB to recharge. As load current \nis applied, switch A turns on every cycle, and its on-time begins to increase. At higher current, switch B turns on briefly after each turn-off of switch A. switches C and D remain off at light load, except to refresh CA (Figure 11) every 10 clock cycles. In Burst Mode operation/skip-cycle mode, the output is prevented from sinking current.\nWhen the FCB pin voltage is tied to the INTV\nCC pin, the \ncontroller enters constant frequency discontinuous current \nmode (DCM). For boost operation, synchronous switch  D \nis held off whenever the I TH pin is below a threshold volt -\nage. In every cycle, switch C is used to charge inductor current. After the output voltage is high  enough, the  \ncontroller will enter continuous current buck mode for one cycle to \ndischarge inductor current. In the following \ncycle, the controller will resume DCM boost operation. For buck operation, constant frequency discontinuous current mode sets a minimum negative inductor current level. synchronous switch B is turned off whenever inductor current is lower than this level. At very light loads, this constant frequency operation is not as efficient as Burst Mode operation or skip-cycle, but does provide lower noise, constant frequency operation.\nFREQUENCY SYNCHRONIZATION AND  \nFREQUENCY SETUP\nThe phase-locked loop allows the internal oscillator to be \nsynchronized to an external source via the PLLIN pin. The \nphase detector output at the PLLFL\nTR pin is also the DC \nfrequency control input of the oscillator . The frequency ranges from 200kHz to 400kHz, corresponding to a DC voltage input from 0V to 2.4V at PLLFL TR. When locked, \nthe PLL aligns the turn on of the top MOSFET to the ris -\ning edge of the synchronizing signal. When PLLIN is left open, the PLLFL TR pin goes low\n, forcing the oscillator to \nits minimum frequency.\nINTV CC/EXTV CC Power\nPower for all power MOSFET drivers and most inter -\nnal circuitry is derived from the INTV CC pin. When the  \nEXTV CC pin is left open, an internal 6V low dropout linear \nregulator supplies INTV CC power . If EXTV CC is taken above \n5.7V, the 6V regulator is turned off and an internal switch \nis turned on, connecting EXTV CC to INTV CC. This allows \nthe INTV CC power to be derived from a high efficiency \nexternal source.\nPOWER GOOD (PGOOD) PIN\nThe PGOOD pin is connected to an open drain of an internal \nMOSFET . The MOSFET turns on and pulls the pin low when the output is not within ±7.5% of the nominal output level as determined by the resistive feedback divider . When the output meets the ±7.5% requirement, the MOSFET is turned off and the pin is allowed to be pulled up by an external resistor to a source of up to 7V.\nLTC3780\n16\nRev G For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nFOLDBACK CURRENT\nFoldback current limiting is activated when the output \nvoltage falls below 70% of its nominal level, reducing power waste. During start-up, foldback current limiting is disabled. \nINPUT UNDERVOL TAGE RESET\nThe SS capacitor will be reset if the input voltage is al -\nlowed to fall below approximately 4V. The SS capacitor \nwill attempt to charge \nthrough a normal soft-start ramp \nafter the input voltage rises above 4V. \nOUTPUT OVERVOL TAGE PROTECTION\nAn overvoltage comparator guards against transient over -\nshoots (>7.5%) as well as other more serious conditions \nthat may over voltage the output. In this case, synchronous\n \nswitch B and synchronous switch D are turned on until the overvoltage condition is cleared or the maximum negative current limit is reached. When inductor current is lower than the maximum negative current limit, synchronous switch B and synchronous switch D are turned off, and switch A and switch C are turned on until the inductor current reaches another negative current limit. If the comparator still detects an overvoltage condition, switch A and switch C are turned off, and synchronous switch B and synchronous switch D are turned on again.SHORT-CIRCUIT PROTECTION AND CURRENT LIMIT\nSwitch A on-time is limited by output voltage. When output \nvoltage is reduced and is lower than its nominal level, switch A on-time will be reduced.\nIn every boost mode cycle, current is limited by a voltage \nreference, which is proportional to the I\nTH pin voltage. The \nmaximum sensed current is limited to 160mV. In every buck mode cycle, the maximum sensed current is limited to 130mV.\nSTANDBY MODE PIN\nThe STBYMD pin is a three-state input that controls circuitry \nwithin the IC as follows: When the STBYMD pin is held at ground, the SS pin is pulled to ground. When the pin is left open, the internal SS current source charges the SS capacitor , allowing turn-on of the controller and activat -\ning necessary internal biasing. When the STBYMD pin is taken above 2V, the internal linear regulator is turned on \nindependent of the state on the RUN and SS pins, providing\n \nan output power source for “wake-up” circuitry. Bypass the pin with a small capacitor (0.1µF) to ground if the pin is not connected to a DC potential.\nLTC3780\n17\nRev G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 11 is a basic LTC3780 application circuit. External \ncomponent selection is driven by the load requirement, and begins with the selection of R\nSENSE  and the inductor \nvalue. Next, the power MOSFETs are selected. Finally, C IN \nand C OUT are selected. This circuit can be configured for \noperation up to an input voltage of 36V.\nSelection of Operation Frequency\nThe LTC3780 uses a constant frequency architecture and \nhas an internal voltage controlled oscillator . The switching frequency is determined by the internal oscillator capacitor . This internal capacitor is charged by a fixed current plus an additional current that is proportional to the voltage applied to the PLLFL TR pin. The frequency of this oscillator can be varied over a 2-to-1 range. The PLLFL TR pin can be grounded to lower the frequency to 200kHz or tied to \n2.4V to yield approximately 400kHz. When PLLIN is left open, the PLLFL TR pin goes low, forcing the oscillator to minimum frequency.\nA graph for the voltage applied to the PLLFL TR pin vs \nfrequency is given in Figure 7. As the operating frequency is increased the gate charge losses will be higher , reducing efficiency. The maximum switching frequency is approxi -\nmately 400kHz.Inductor Selection\nThe operating frequency and inductor selection are inter -\nrelated in that higher operating frequencies allow the use of \nsmaller inductor and capacitor values. The inductor value has a direct effect on ripple current. The inductor current ripple ∆I\nL is typically set to 20% to 40% of the maximum \ninductor current at boost mode V IN(MIN) . For a given ripple \nthe inductance terms in continuous mode are as follows:\n LVV V\nIBOOSTINMIN OUT INMIN\nOUT>() () ()\n(•– •\n•2100\nƒMMAX OUT\nBUCKOUT INMAXORippleVH\nLVV V)\n()•% •,\n•–2\n>UUT\nOUT MAXI NMAX IR ippleVH() •\n•• %•() ()100\nƒ\nwhere: \n f is operating frequency, Hz\n % Ripple is allowable inductor current ripple, %\n VIN(MIN)  is minimum input voltage, V\n VIN(MAX)  is maximum input voltage, V\n VOUT is output voltage, V\n IOUT(MAX)  is maximum output load current\nFor high efficiency, choose an inductor with low core \nloss, such as ferrite and molypermalloy (from Magnetics, Inc.). Also, the inductor should have low DC resistance to reduce the I\n2R losses, and must be able to handle the peak \ninductor current without saturation.  To minimize radiated noise, use a toroid, pot core or shielded bobbin inductor .\nR\nSENSE  Selection and Maximum Output Current\nRSENSE  is chosen based on the required output current. \nThe current comparator threshold sets the peak of the \ninductor current in boost mode and the maximum inductor valley current in buck mode.

A 20% to \n30% margin is usually recommended.\nCIN and C OUT Selection\nIn boost mode, input current is continuous. In buck mode, \ninput current is discontinuous. In buck mode, the selection of input capacitor C\nIN is driven by the need to filter the \ninput square wave current. Use a low ESR capacitor sized to handle the maximum RMS current. For buck operation, the input RMS current is given by:\n  IRMS ≈IOUT(MAX) •VOUT\nVIN•VIN\nVOUT– 1\nThis formula has a maximum at V IN = 2VOUT, where  \nIRMS = I OUT(MAX) /2. This simple worst-case condition \nis commonly used for design because even significant deviations do not offer much relief. Note that ripple cur -\nrent ratings from capacitor manufacturers are often based on only 2000 hours of life which makes it advisable to derate the capacitor . \nIn boost mode, the discontinuous current shifts from the input to the output, so C\nOUT must be capable of reducing \nthe output voltage ripple. The effects of ESR (equivalent series resistance) and the bulk capacitance must be considered when choosing the right capacitor for a given output ripple voltage.

Important parameters for the \npower MOSFETs are the breakdown voltage V BR,DSS , \nthreshold voltage V GS,TH , on-resistance R DS(ON) , reverse \ntransfer capacitance C RSS and maximum current I DS(MAX) .\nThe drive voltage is set by the 6V INTV CC supply.

In particular , D2 significantly reduces reverse recovery current between switch D turn-off and switch C turn-on, which improves converter efficiency and reduces switch C voltage stress.

As a result, D2 should be rated for about one-third to one-fourth of the full load current. \nIn buck mode, when the FCB pin voltage is higher than \n5.3V, the converter operates in constant frequency dis -\ncontinuous current mode. In this mode, synchronous switch B remains on until the inductor valley current is lower than the sense voltage representing the minimum negative inductor current level (V\nSENSE  = –5mV). Both \nswitch A and B are off until next clock signal.\nIn boost mode, when the FCB pin voltage is 0.85 < V FCB \n< 5.3V, the converter operates in Burst Mode operation. \nIn this mode, the controller clamps the peak inductor current to approximately 20% of the maximum inductor current. The output voltage ripple can increase during Burst Mode operation. INTV\nCC Regulator\nAn internal P-channel low dropout regulator produces 6V at the INTV\nCC pin from the V IN supply pin. INTV CC powers \nthe drivers and internal circuitry within the LTC3780. The INTV\nCC pin regulator can supply a peak current of 40mA \nand must be bypassed to ground with a minimum of 4.7µF tantalum, 10µF special polymer or low ESR type electrolytic capacitor . A 1µF ceramic capacitor placed directly adjacent to the INTV\nCC and PGND IC pins is highly recommended. \nGood bypassing is necessary to supply the high transient current required by MOSFET gate drivers.\nHigher input voltage applications in which large MOSFETs \nare being driven at high frequencies may cause the maxi -\nmum junction temperature rating for the LTC3780 to be exceeded. The system supply current is normally dominated  \nby the gate charge current. Additional external loading of the INT\nVCC also needs to be taken into account for the \npower dissipation calculations. The total INTV CC current \ncan be supplied by either the 6V internal linear regulator or by the EXTV\nCC input pin. When the voltage applied to \nthe EXTV CC pin is less than 5.7V, all of the INTV CC current \nis supplied by the internal 6V linear regulator . Power dis -\nsipation for the IC in this case is V IN • IINTVCC , and overall \nefficiency is lowered. The junction temperature can be estimated by using the equations given in Note 2 of the Electrical Characteristics. For example, a typical applica -\ntion operating in continuous current mode might draw 24mA  from a \n24V supply when not using the EXTV CC pin:\n TJ = 70°C + 24mA • 24V • 34°C/W = 90°C  \nUse of the EXTV CC input pin reduces the junction tem -\nperature to:\n TJ = 70°C + 24mA • 6V • 34°C/W = 75°C\nTo prevent maximum junction temperature from being exceeded, the input supply current must be checked op -\nerating in continuous mode at maximum V\nIN.\nLTC3780\n21\nRev G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nEXTV CC Connection\nThe LTC3780 contains an internal P-channel MOSFET \nswitch connected between the EXTV CC and INTV CC pins. \nWhen the voltage applied to EXTV CC rises above 5.7V, the \ninternal regulator is turned off and a switch connects the EXTV\nCC pin to the INTV CC pin thereby supplying internal \npower . The switch remains closed as long as the voltage applied to EXTV\nCC remains above 5.5V. This allows the \nMOSFET driver and control power to be derived from the output when (5.7V < V\nOUT < 7V) and from the internal \nregulator when the output is out of regulation (start-up, short-circuit). If more current is required through the EXTV\nCC switch than is specified, an external Schottky \ndiode can be interposed between the EXTV CC and INTV CC \npins. Ensure that EXTV CC ≤ V IN. \nThe following list summarizes the three possible connec -\ntions for EXTV CC:\n1. EXT\nVCC left open (or grounded). This will cause INTV CC \nto be powered from the internal 6V regulator at the cost of a small efficiency penalty.\n2.\n EXT\nVCC connected directly to V OUT (5.7V < V OUT < 7V). \nThis is the normal connection for a 6V regulator and provides the highest efficiency.\n3.\n EXT\nVCC connected to an external supply. If an external \nsupply is available in the 5.5V to 7V range, it may be used to power EXTV\nCC provided it is compatible with \nthe MOSFET gate drive requirements.\nOutput Voltage\nThe LTC3780 output voltage is set by an external feedback \nresistive divider carefully placed across the output capacitor . The resultant feedback signal is compared with the internal precision 0.800V voltage reference by the error amplifier . The output voltage is given by the equation:\n VVR\nROUT=+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 08 12\n1.•\nTopside MOSFET Driver Supply (C A, DA, CB, DB)\nReferring to Figure 11, the external bootstrap capacitors C\nA and C B connected to the BOOST1 and BOOST2 pins supply the gate drive voltage for the topside MOSFET switches A and D. When the top MOSFET switch A turns on, the switch node SW2 rises to V\nIN and the BOOST2 \npin rises to approximately V IN + INTV CC. When the bottom \nMOSFET switch B turns on, the switch node SW2 drops to low and the boost capacitor C\nB is charged through D B \nfrom INTV CC. When the top MOSFET switch D turns on, \nthe switch node SW1 rises to V OUT and the BOOST1 pin \nrises to approximately V OUT + INTV CC. When the bottom \nMOSFET switch C turns on, the switch node SW1 drops to low and the boost capacitor C\nA is charged through D A \nfrom INTV CC. The boost capacitors C A and C B need to \nstore about 100 times the gate charge required by the top MOSFET switch A and D. In most applications a 0.1µF to 0.47µF, X5R or X7R dielectric capacitor is adequate.\nRun Function\nThe RUN pin provides simple ON/OFF control for the \nLTC3780. Driving the RUN pin above 1.5V permits the controller to start operating. Pulling RUN below 1.5V puts the LTC3780 into low current shutdown. Do not apply more than 6V to the RUN pin.\nSoft-Start Function\nSoft-start reduces the input power sources’ surge cur -\nrents by gradually increasing the controller’s current \nlimit (proportional to an internally buffered and clamped equivalent of V\nITH). \nAn internal 1.2µA current source charges up the C SS ca-\npacitor . As the voltage on SS increases from 0V to 2.4V, the internal current limit rises from 0V/R\nSENSE  to 150mV/\nRSENSE . The output current limit ramps up slowly, taking \n1.5s/µF to reach full current. The output current thus ramps up slowly, eliminating the starting surge current required from the input power supply.\n  TIRMP =2.4V\n1.2µA• CSS= 1.5s/µF( )• CSS\nDo not apply more than 6V to the SS pin. \nCurrent foldback is disabled during soft-start until the \nvoltage on C SS reaches 2V. Make sure C SS is large enough \nwhen there is loading during start-up.\nLTC3780\n22\nRev G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe Standby Mode (STBYMD) Pin Function\nThe standby mode (STBYMD) pin provides several choices \nfor start-up and standby operational modes. If the pin is pulled to ground, the SS pin is internally pulled to ground, preventing start-up and thereby providing a single control pin for turning off the controller . If the pin is left open or bypassed to ground with a capacitor , the SS pin is internally provided with a starting current, permitting external control for turning on the controller . If the pin is connected to a voltage greater than 1.25V, the internal regulator (INTV\nCC) \nwill be on even when the controller is shut down (RUN pin voltage < 1.5V). In this mode, the onboard 6V linear regulator can provide power to keep-alive functions such as a keyboard controller .  \nFault Conditions: Current Limit and Current Foldback\nThe maximum inductor current is inherently limited in a \ncurrent mode controller by the maximum sense voltage. In boost mode, maximum sense voltage and the sense resistance determines the maximum allowed inductor peak current, which is:\n  IL(MAX,BOOST) =160mV\nRSENSE\nIn buck mode, maximum sense voltage and the sense resistance determines the maximum allowed inductor valley current, which is:\n  IL(MAX,BUCK) =130mV\nRSENSE\nTo further limit current in the event of a short circuit to ground, the LTC3780 includes foldback current limiting. If the output falls by more than 30%, then the maximum sense voltage is progressively lowered to about one third of its full value.Fault Conditions: Overvoltage Protection\nA comparator monitors the output for overvoltage con -\nditions. The comparator (OV) detects overvoltage faults \ngreater than 7.5% above the nominal output voltage. When  \nthe \ncondition is sensed, switches A and C are turned off, \nand switches B and D are turned on until the overvoltage condition is cleared. During an overvoltage condition, a negative current limit (V\nSENSE  = –60mV) is set to limit \nnegative inductor current. When the sensed current in -\nductor current is lower than –60mV, switch A and C are turned on, and switch B and D are turned off until the sensed current is higher than –20mV \n. If the output is still \nin overvoltage condition, switch A and C are turned off, and switch B and D are turned on again.\nEfficiency Considerations\nThe percent efficiency of a switching regulator is equal to \nthe output power divided by the input power times 100%. It is often useful to analyze individual losses to determine what is limiting the efficiency and which change would produce the most improvement. Although all dissipative elements in circuit produce losses, four main sources account for most of the losses in LTC3780 circuits:\n1.\n DC I2R losses. These arise from the resistances of the \nMOSFETs, sensing resistor , inductor and PC board \ntraces and cause the efficiency to drop at high output currents. \n2.\n T ransition loss. This loss arises from the brief amount of time switch A or switch C spends in the saturated region during switch node transitions. It depends upon the input voltage, load current, driver strength and MOSFET capacitance, among other factors. The loss is significant at input voltages above \n20V and can be \nestimated from:\n  T\nransition Loss ≈ 1.7A–1 • VIN2 • IOUT • CRSS • f\n where C RSS is the reverse transfer capacitance.\nLTC3780\n23\nRev G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n3. INTV CC current. This is the sum of the MOSFET driver \nand control currents. This loss can be reduced by sup -\nplying INTV CC current through the EXTV CC pin from a \nhigh efficiency source, such as an output derived boost \nnetwork or alternate supply if available.\n4. CIN and C OUT loss. The input capacitor has the difficult \njob of filtering the large RMS input current to the regula -\ntor in buck mode. The output capacitor has the more difficult job of filtering the large RMS output current in boost mode. Both C\nIN and C OUT are required to have \nlow ESR to minimize the AC I2R loss and sufficient \ncapacitance to prevent the RMS current from causing additional upstream losses in fuses or batteries.\n5.\n Other losses. \nSchottky diode D1 and D2 are respon -\nsible for conduction losses during dead time and light load conduction periods. Inductor core loss occurs predominately at light loads. Switch C causes reverse recover y current loss in boost mode. \nWhen making adjustments to improve efficiency\n, the input \ncurrent is the best indicator of changes in efficiency. If you make a change and the input current decreases, then the efficiency has increased. If there is no change in input current, then there is no change in efficiency.\nDesign Example\nAs a design example, assume V\nIN = 5V to 18V (12V nomi -\nnal), V OUT = 12V (5%), I OUT(MAX)  = 5A and f = 400kHz. \nSet the PLLFL TR pin at 2.4V for 400kHz operation. The \ninductance value is chosen first based on a 30% ripple current assumption.

Also, for high current, a multilayer board provides heat sinking for power components. \n•\n The ground plane layer should not have any traces and \nit should be as close as possible to the layer with power MOSFETs.\n•\n Place C IN, switch A, switch B and D1 in one com -\npact area.

Use several large vias for each power \ncomponent.\n• Use planes \nfor V IN and V OUT to maintain good voltage \nfiltering and to keep power losses low.\n• Flood all unused areas on all layers with copper . Flooding\n \nwith copper will reduce the temperature rise of power components. Connect the copper areas to any DC net (V\nIN or GND).\n• Segregate the signal and power grounds. All small-signal components should return to the SGND pin at one point, which is then tied to the PGND pin close to the sources of switch B and switch C.\n•\n Place switch B and switch C as close to the controller as possible, keeping the PGND, BG and SW traces short.\n•\n Keep the high dV/dT SW1, SW2, BOOST1, BOOST2, TG1\n and TG2 nodes away from sensitive small-signal \nnodes.\n• The path formed by switch A, switch B, D1\n and the C IN \ncapacitor should have short leads and PC trace lengths.
