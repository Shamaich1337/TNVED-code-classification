Its excellent phase \naccuracy and amplitude balance enable both high performance \nintermediate frequency (IF) and  direct radio frequency (RF) \nmodulation for communication systems.  \nThe ADL5385 takes the signals from two differential baseband \ninputs and modulates them onto two carriers in quadrature \nwith each other. The two internal carriers are derived from a \nsingle -ended, external local oscillator input signal at twice the \nfrequency as the desired carrier output. The two modulated \nsignals are summed together in a differential -to-single -ended \namplifier designed to drive 50 Ω loads.  The ADL 5385 can be used as either a n IF or a direct -to-RF \nmodulator in digital communication systems. The wide \nbaseband input bandwidth allows for  either baseband drive or \ndrive from a complex IF. Typical applications are in radio -link \ntransmitters, cable modem termination systems, and broadband \nwireless access systems.  \nThe ADL5385 is fabricated using the Analog Devices, Inc., \nadvanced silicon germanium bipolar pr ocess and is packaged  in \na 24-lead, RoH S-compliant  LFCSP with expose d pad. Performance  \nis specified over – 40°C to +85°C. A RoHS -compliant evaluation \nboard is also available.  \n \nADL5385 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

D | Page 14 of 24 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION  \nOVERVIEW  \nThe ADL5385 can be divided into five sections: the local \noscillator (LO) interface, the baseband voltage -to-current (V -to-I) \nconverter, the mixers, the differential -to-single -ended (D -to-S) \namplifier, and the bias circuit. A detailed block diagram of the \ndevice is shown in Figure 28. \nTEMPERATURE\nSENSORBIAS\nVOUTTEMPENBL\nIBBP\nIBBN\nQBBP\nQBBNLOIP\nLOINDIVIDE-BY-2\nQUADRATURE\nPHASE\nSPLITTER\n06118-001 \nFigur e 28. ADL5385  Block Diagram \nThe LO  interface generates two LO signals at 90 ° of phase \ndifference to drive two mixers in quadrature. Baseband signals are converted into c urrents by the V -to-I converters that  feed \ninto the two mixers. The outputs of the mixers are combined in \nthe differential -to-single -ended amplifier, which provides a 50 Ω \noutput interface. Reference currents to each section are \ngenerated by the bias circu it. A detailed description of each \nsection follows.  LO INTERFACE  \nThe LO interface consists of a buffer amplifier  followed by a \npair of  frequency dividers  that generate two carriers at half the \ninput frequency and in quadrature with each other. Each carrier  \nis then amplified and amplitude -limited to drive the double -\nbalanced mixers.  \nV-TO -I CONVERTER  \nThe differential baseband input voltages that are applied to the \nbaseband input pins are fed to a pair of common -emitter , \nvoltage -to-current converters. The output currents then \nmodulate the two half -frequency LO carriers in the mixer stage.  \nMIXERS  \nThe ADL5385 has two double -balanced mixers:  one for the in -\nphase c hannel (I channel) and one for the quadrature channel \n(Q channel). These mixers are based on the Gilbert cell design of four cross -connected transistors. The output currents from \nthe two mixers are summed together in the resistor -inductor \n(RL) loads in the  D-to-S amplifier.  \nD-TO -S AMPLIFIER  \nThe output D- to-S amplifier consists of two emitter followers \ndriving a totem -pole output stage  that converts the differential \nsignal to a single -ended signal . Output impedance is established \nby the emitter resistors in the output transistors. The output of \nthis stage connects to the output (VOUT ) pin.  \nBIAS CIRCUIT  \nA band gap reference circuit generates the proportional -to-\nabsolute -temperature (PTAT) as well as temperature -independ-\nent reference currents used by different sections. The band -gap \ncircuit is tu rned on by a logic high at the ENBL  pin, which in \nturn powers up the whole device. A PTAT voltage output is \navailable at the TEMP pin, which can  be u sed for temperature \nmonitoring  as well as for temperature compensation  purposes.  \n \n \nData Sheet ADL5385 \n \nRev. D | Page 15 of 24 BASIC CONNECTIONS  \nFigure 29 shows the basic connections for the ADL5385. \nPOWER SUPPLY AND GRO UNDING  \nAll the VPS pins must be connected to the same 5  V source. \nAdjacen t pins of the same name can be tied together and decoupled \nwith a 0.1 µ F capacitor. Locate t hese capacitors as close as possible \nto the device. The power supply can range from  4.75 V to  5.5 V .  \nThe COM1 pin, COM2 pin, and COM3 pin are  tied t o the same \nground plane through low impedance paths. The exposed pad  \non the under side of the package is also soldered to a low thermal \nand e lectrical impedance ground plane. If the ground plane spans \nmultiple layers on the circuit board, stitch the layers  together \nwith nine vias under the exposed pad . The Analog Devices   \nAN-722 Application Note  discusses the thermal and electrical \ngrounding of the LFCSP in g reater detail.  \nBASEBAND INPUTS  \nThe baseband inputs QBBP , QBBN, IBBP , and IBBN must be \ndriven from a differential source. The nominal drive level of \n1.4 V p-p differential (700 mV p- p on each pin) is  biased to a \ncommon -mode level of 500 mV dc.  \nThe dc common- mode bias level for the baseband inputs can \nrange from 400 mV to 600 mV . This results in a reduction in \nthe usable input ac swing range. The nominal dc bias of 500 mV \nallows for the largest ac swing, limited on the bottom end by the ADL5385 input range and on the top end by the output \ncompliance range on most Analog Devices DACs. LO INPUT  \nA single -ended LO signal is  applied to the LOIP pin through \nan ac coupling capacitor. The LO return pin, LOIN, must  be  \nac-coupled  to ground though a low impedance path.  \nThe LO input can be driven differentially, in which case the user ac couples both sides of the differential LO source through a pair  of \nseries capacitors to the LOIP and LOIN pins. The nominal LO \ndrive of −7 dBm, which is recommended, can be increased to up to 5 dBm. For operation below 50  MHz, it is recommended to \nuse a minimum LO drive level of 0 dBm . The effect of  LO power \non sideba nd suppression and carrier feedthrough is shown in \nFigure 17 and Figure 21. The performance vs. LO power at \n30 MHz output frequency is shown at Figure 9. \nRF OUTPUT  \nThe RF output is available at the VOUT  pin (Pin 7 ). This pin \nmust als o be ac -coupled. Below 150  MHz, output power decreas es \ndue to internal ac -coupling. This is shown in Figure 8. The \nVOUT pin has a nominal broadband impedance of 50 Ω and \ndoes not need further external matching.  \n \n  \nR22\n10kΩ\nVPOSGNDVPOSVPOSSW21R21\n49.9Ω OFF ON\nLO\nVOUTENBLRFPQ\n0ΩRFNQ\n0ΩCFPQ\nOPENCFNQ\nOPENQBBP QBBN\n24VPS323VPS322LOIN21LOIP20COM319COM3\nVOUT7VPS18VPS19TEMP 10VPS211ENBL126COM15COM14COM13NC2NC1NC\nIBBP13IBBN 14COM215COM216QBBN 17QBBP18\nADL5385\nU1\n4×4LFCSP\nEXPOSEDPADD LETEMPENBRTQ\nOPEN\nR11\n0ΩRFNI\n0ΩRFPI\n0ΩCFNI\nOPENCFPI\nOPENIBBN IBBP\nRTI\nOPEN\nCLOP\n0.1µF\nCLON\n0.1µF\nC11\nOPENC12\n0.1µFR12\n0ΩRTEMP\n200Ω\nC14\n0.1µFC13\nOPENC16\n0.1µFC15\nOPEN\nCOUT\n0.1µFR13\n0Ω\n06118 -041\n \nFigure 29.

D | Page 16 of 24 OPTIMIZATION  \nThe carrier feedthrough and sideband suppression performance \nof the ADL5385  can be improved through the use of optimization  \ntechniques.  \nCarrier Feedthrough Nulling \nCarrier feedthrough results from minute dc offsets that occur \nbetween each of the differential baseb and inputs. In an ideal \nmodulator, the quantities (V IOPP − V IOPN) and (V QOPP − V QOPN) \nare equal to zero, and this results in no carrier feedthrough. In a \nreal modulator, those two quantities are nonzero and, when mixed \nwith the LO, result in a finite amoun t of carrier feedthrough. The \nADL5385 is designed to provide a minimal amount of carrier \nfeedthrough. If even lower carrier feedthrough levels are required, minor adjustments can be made to the (V\nIOPP − V IOPN) and (V QOPP − \nVQOPN) offsets. The I -channel offset is held constant while the \nQ-channel offset is varied until a minimum carrier feedthrough \nlevel is obtained. The Q -channel offset required to achieve this \nminimum is held constant  while the offset on the I -channel is \nadjusted, until a better minimum is reached. Through two \niterations of this process, the carrier feedthrough can be reduc ed to \nas low as the output noise. The ability to null is sometimes limited \nby the resolution of the offset adjustment. Figure 30 shows the \nrelationship of carrier feedthrough vs. dc offset.  \n–58\n–94\n–420\n420CARRIER FEEDTHROUGH (dBm)\nVP-VN OFFEST ( µV)\n06118-029–62\n–66\n–70\n–74\n–78\n–82–86\n–90\n300240\n360180120600–300\n–240–360\n–180\n–120\n–60\n \nFigure 30.

When no offset is applied , \nVIOPP = VIOPN = 500 mV , or  \nVIOPP − VIOPN = VIOS = 0 V  \nWhen an offset of +V IOS is applied to the I -channel inputs , \nVIOPP = 500 mV + V IOS/2, while  \nVIOPN = 500 mV − V IOS/2, such that  \nVIOPP − VIOPN = VIOS \nThe same applies to the Q channel.  \n \n It is often desirable to perform a one- time carrier null calibration . \nThis is usually performed at a single frequency.

For example, if the amplitude \noffset is 0.25 dB, improving the phase imbalance better than 1° does not yield any improvement in the sideband suppression.  For \noptimum sideband suppression, an iterative adjustment \nbetween phase and amplitude is req uired.  \nThe sideband suppression nulling can be performed either through \nadjusting the gain for each channel or through the modification \nof the phase and gain of the digital data coming from the digital \nsignal processor.  \n  \nData Sheet ADL5385\n \nRev. D | Page 17 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nDAC MODULATOR INTERFACING \nThe ADL5385  is designed to interface with minimal components \nto members of the Analog Device s family of digital-to-analog \nconverters (DAC). These DACs feature an output current swing \nfrom 0 mA to 20 mA, and the interface described in this section can be used with any DAC that has a similar output. \nDriving the ADL5385 with an Analog Devices TxDAC® \nAn example of the interface using the AD9777 TxDAC is shown \nin Figure 33. The baseband inputs of the ADL5385  require a dc \nbias of 500 mV . The average output current on each of the outputs of the AD9777 is 10 mA. Therefore, a single 50 Ω resistor to \nground from each of the DAC outputs results in an average current \nof 10 mA flowing through each of the resistors, thus producing \nthe desired 500 mV dc bias for the inputs to the ADL5385 . \n06118-030RBIP\n50Ω\nRBIN\n50Ω73\n7213\n14\nIBBNIBBPAD9777 ADL5385\nRBQN\n50Ω\nRBQP\n50Ω69\n6817\n18IOUTB1IOUTA1\nIOUTA2IOUTB2\nQBBPQBBN\n \nFigure 33. Interface Between AD9777  and ADL5385 with 50 Ω Resistors to \nGround to Establish the 500 mV DC Bias for the ADL5385 Baseband Inputs \nThe AD9777 output currents have a swing that ranges from \n0 mA to 20 mA. With the 50 Ω resistors in place, the ac voltage \nswing going into the ADL5385 baseband inputs ranges from \n0 V to 1 V . A full-scale sine wave out of the AD9777 can be described as a 1 V p-p single-ended (or 2 V p-p differential) \nsine wave with a 500 mV dc bias. \nLimiting the AC Swing \nThere are situations in which it is desirable to reduce the \nac voltage swing for a given DAC output current. This can \nbe achieved through the addition of another resistor to the interface. This resistor is placed in shunt between each side of the differential pair, as illustrated in Figure 34. It has the effect \nof reducing the ac swing without changing the dc bias already \nestablished by the 50 Ω resistors. \n06118-032RBIP\n50Ω\nRBIN\n50Ω\nIBBNIBBPAD9777 ADL5385\nRBQN\n50Ω\nRBQP\n50ΩRSLI\n100Ω\nRSLQ\n100Ω\nQBBPQBBN73\n7213\n14\n69\n6817\n18IOUTB1IOUTA1\nIOUTA2IOUTB2\n \nFigure 34.

Relationship Between AC Swing Limiting Resistor and \nPeak-to-Peak Voltage Swing with 50 Ω Bias Setting Resistors \nFiltering \nWhen driving a modulator from a DAC, it is necessary to \nintroduce a low-pass filter between the DAC and the modulator \nto reduce the DAC images. The interface for setting up the biasing and ac swing lends itself well to the introduction of such a filter. The filter can be inserted in between the dc bias setting \nresistors and the ac swing-limiting resistor, thus establishing the \ninput and output impedances for the filter. \nExamples of filters are discussed in the 155 Mbps (STM-1) 128 \nQAM Transmitter section and the CMTS Transmitter \nApplication section. \n   \n \nADL5385 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 18 of 24 Using AD9777 Auxiliary DAC for Carrier Feedthrough \nNulling \nThe AD9777 features an auxiliary DAC that can be used to \ninject small currents into the differential outputs for each \nchannel. The auxiliary DAC can produce the small offset \ncurrents necessary to implement the nulling described in the \nCarrier Feedthrough Nulling section. \n155 Mbps (STM-1) 128 QAM TRANSMITTER  \nFigure 39 shows how the ADL5385  can be interfaced to the \nAD9777 DAC (or any Analog Devices dual DAC with an output \nbias level of 0.5 V) to generate a 155 Mbps 128 QAM carrier at 355 MHz. Because the TxDAC output and the IQ modulator inputs operate at the same bias levels of 0.5 V , a simple dc-\ncoupled connection can be implemented without any active or \npassive level shifting. The bias level and modulator drive level is set by the 50 Ω ground-referenced resistors and the 100 Ω shunt resistors, respectively (see the DAC Modulator Interfacing section). A baseband filter is placed between the bias and signal \nswing resistors. This 5-pole Chebychev filter with in-band ripple \nof 0.1 dB has a corner frequency of 39 MHz.  \nFigure 36 shows a spectral plot of the 128 QAM spectrum at  \na carrier power of −6.3 dBm. Figure 37 shows how EVM (measured with the analyzer’s internal equalizer both on and off) and SNR, measured at 55 MHz carrier offset (2.5 times the \ncarrier bandwidth) varies with output power. \n–70\n–80\n–90\n–100\n–110\n–120\n–130\n–140\n–150\n–160\n290 420 410 390 400 380 370 360 350 340 330 320 310 300POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY (dBm/Hz)\nFREQUENCY (MHz)\n06118-044\n \nFigure 36.

Figure 41 shows the level of these harmonics (out to 3 GHz)  \nas a function of the output frequency from 50 MHz to 1000 MHz,  \nin a single -sideband (SSB) test configuration, with a baseband \nsignal of 1 MHz  and a  SSB level of approximately − 5 dBm.  To \nread th is plot correctly, first pick the output frequency of interest  on \nthe trace called POUT. The associated harmonics can be  read off \nthe harmonic traces at multiples of this frequency.  For example, \nat an out put frequency of 500 MHz,  the fundamental power is  \n−5 dBm.  The power of the second (P 2fc − BB) and third (P 3fc + BB) \nharmonics is −63 dBm (at 1000 MHz)  and −16 dBm (at 1500 \nMHz) , respectively.  Of particular importance are the products \nfrom odd -harmonics of  the LO, generated from the switching \noperation in the mixers.   \nFor cable TV operation at frequencies above approximately \n500 MHz,  these harmonics fall out of the band and can be \nfiltered by a fixed filter.  However, as the frequency drops below \n500 MHz, th ese harmonics start to fall close to or inside the \ncable band. This calls for either limitation of the frequency range to above 500 MHz or the use of a switchable filter bank to \nblock in -band harmonics at low frequencies.  0\n–90\n0 1000POUT, P_HARM  (dBm)\nOUTPUT FREQUENCY (MHz)\n06118-035–80–70–60–50–40–30–20–10\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900POUT\nP7LO + BB P5LO – BBP3LO + BB\nP6LO – BBP4LO + BBP2LO – BB\n \nFigure 41.

The ADL5385-DIFFLO-\nEBZ  can be configured to allow a differential LO drive through a \nbalun or direct interfacing to a PLL evaluation board. It also \nincludes component pads in its LO path to accommodate a \nharmonic filter. The four baseband inputs are located on one edge of the board to allow direct connection to a high speed DAC evaluation board. The ADL5385-DIFFLO-EBZ  also \nincludes an RF/IF amplifier.  The modulator output can be measured directly at the RF_OUT SMA connector. Alternatively, by removing R40, and installing a 0 Ω resistor in the R25 pad, the modulator output can be fed to \nthe RF amplifier. \nThe ADL5385-DIFFLO-EBZ  ships installed with an ADL5601  \namplifier (50 MHz to 4000 MHz RF/IF amplifier). The ADL5602 \ncan be used if more gain is needed.
