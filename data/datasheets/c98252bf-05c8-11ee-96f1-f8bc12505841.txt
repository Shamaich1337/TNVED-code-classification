Pin Descriptions \nSerial Clock (CLK): The SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and \noutput operations.  \n \nSerial Data Input, Output and I/Os (DI, DO and DQ 0, DQ 1): The FM25F01 supports standard \nSPI and Dual SPI operation. Standard SPI instructi ons use the unidirecti onal DI (input) pin to \nserially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of the Serial Clock \n(CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidi rectional DO (output) to  read data or status \nfrom the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \n \nDual SPI instructions use the bi directional DQ pins to serially write instructions, addresses or \ndata to the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on the \nfalling edge of CLK.  Chip Select (CS#): The SPI Chip Select (CS#) pin enabl es and disables device operation. \nWhen CS# is high, the device is deselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or DQ\n0, DQ 1) pins \nare at high impedance. When desel ected, the devices power consumption will be at standby \nlevels unless an internal erase, program or write status register cycle is in progress. When CS# \nis brought low, the device will be selected, power consumption will increase to active levels and \ninstructions can be written to and data read from the device. After power-u p, CS# must transition \nfrom high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The CS# input  must track the VCC \nsupply level at power-up (see “ 9 Write Protection” and Figure 25). If needed a pull-up resister on \nCS# can be used to acco\nmplish this. \n \nHOLD (HOLD#): The HOLD# pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. \nWhen HOLD# is brought low, while CS# is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals \non the DI and CLK pins will be ignored (don’t care). When HOLD# is brought high, device \noperation can resume. The HOLD# function can be useful when mult iple devices are sharing the \nsame SPI signals. The HOLD# pin is active low.  \n Write Protect (WP#): The Write Protect (WP#) pin can be us ed to prevent the Status Registers \nfrom being written. Used in conjunction with the Status  Register’s Block Protect (BP2, BP1 and \nBP0) bits and Status Register Prot ect (SRP) bits, a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire \nmemory array can be hardware protect ed. The WP# pin is active low.  \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             6 7. Memory Organization \nThe FM25F01 array is organized into 512 progra mmable pages of 256-bytes each. Up to 256 \nbytes can be programmed (bits are programmed from  1 to 0) at a time. Pages can be erased in \ngroups of 16 (4KB sector eras e), groups of 128 (32KB block er ase), groups of 256 (64KB block \nerase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The FM25F01 has 32 erasable sectors , 4 erasable 32-k \nbyte blocks and 2 erasable 64-k byte blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for \ngreater flexibility in applications that  require data and parameter storage.  \n \nTable 1 Memory Organization \nBlock \n(64KB)  Sector \n(4KB)  Address Range \n1 31 01F000h 01FFFFh \n: : : \n16 010000h 010FFFh \n0 15 00F000h 00FFFFh \n: : : \n3 003000h 003FFFh \n2 002000h 002FFFh \n1 001000h 001FFFh \n0 000000h 000FFFh \n \nBlock \n(32KB)  Sector \n(4KB)  Address Range \n3 31 01F000h 01FFFFh \n: : : \n25 019000h 019FFFh \n24 018000h 018FFFh \n2 23 017000h 017FFFh \n: : : \n17 011000h 011FFFh \n16 010000h 010FFFh \n1 15 00F000h 00FFFFh \n: : : \n9 009000h 009FFFh \n8 008000h 008FFFh \n0 7 007000h 007FFFh \n: : : \n1 001000h 001FFFh \n0 000000h 000FFFh \n \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             7 8. Device Operations \n8.1. Standard SPI \nThe FM25F01 is accessed through an SPI compatible  bus consisting of f our signals: Serial \nClock (CLK), Chip Select (CS#), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard \nSPI instructions use the DI  input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device \non the rising edge of CLK. The DO output pin is used to read data or  status from the device on \nthe falling edge of CLK. \n \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between \nMode 0 and Mode 3 concerns the nor mal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in \nstandby and data is not being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0, the CLK signal is \nnormally low on the falling and rising edges of CS#.  For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high \non the falling and rising edges of CS#. \nFigure 2 The difference between Mode 0 and Mode 3   \n \n8.2. Dual SPI \nThe FM25F01 supports Dual SPI oper ation when using instructions  such as “Fast Read Dual \nOutput (3Bh)” and “Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the device at two to three times the rate  of ordinary Serial Flas h devices. The Dual SPI \nRead instructions are ideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power-up (code-\nshadowing) or for executing non-speed- critical co de directly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using \nDual SPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become bidirectional I/O pins: DQ\n0 and DQ 1. \n \n8.3. Hold \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI oper ations, the HOLD# signal allows the FM25F01 operation to \nbe paused while it is actively se lected (when CS# is low). The HOLD# function may be useful in \ncases where the SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For example, \nconsider if the page buffer was only partially writt en when a priority interrupt requires use of the \nSPI bus. In this case the HOLD# function can save the state of the instruction and the data in the buffer so programming can resume where it left off once the bus is available again.   \nTo initiate a HOLD# condition, the device must  be selected with CS# low. A HOLD# condition \nwill activate on the falling edge of the HOLD# signal if  the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is \nnot already low the HOLD# conditi on will activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The HOLD# \ncondition will terminate on the rising edge of the HOLD# signal if t he CLK signal is already low. If \nthe CLK is not already low the HOLD# condition will terminate a fter the next falling edge of CLK. \nDuring a HOLD# condition, the Serial Data Out put (DO) is high impedance, and Serial Data \nInput (DI) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored.  The Chip Select (CS#) signal should be kept \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             8 active (low) for the full duration of the HOLD# operation to avoid resetting the internal logic state \nof the device. \n \nFigure 3 Hold Condition Waveform \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             9 9. Write Protection \nApplications that use non- volatile memory must take into c onsideration the possibility of noise \nand other adverse system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this \nconcern, the FM25F01 provides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes. \n \nWrite Protect Features \nz Device resets when VCC is below threshold \nz Time delay write disable after Power-up \nz Write enable/disable instructions and automatic write dis able after erase or program \nz Software and Hardware (WP# pin) wr ite protection using Status Register \nz Write Protection using Power-down instruction \nz Lock Down write protection for Stat us Register until the next power-up \nz One Time Program (OTP) write protection fo r array and Security Sectors using Status \nRegister. \n \nUpon power-up or at power-down,  the FM25F01 will maintain a reset condition while VCC is \nbelow the threshold value of VWI, (See “ 12.3 Power-up Timing” and Figure 25). While reset, all \noperatio\nns are disabled and no in structions are recognized. Du ring power-up and after the VCC \nvoltage exceeds VWI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time \ndelay of t PUW. This includes the Write E nable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip \nErase and the Write Status Register  instructions. Note that the chip select pin (CS#) must track \nthe VCC supply level at power-up until the VCC-min level and t VSL time delay is reached. If \nneeded a pull-up resister on CS# c an be used to accomplish this. \n \nAfter power-up the device is aut omatically placed in a write-di sabled state with the Status \nRegister Write Enable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instruction must be issued before \na Page Program, Sector Erase, Blo ck Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will \nbe accepted. After completing a program, erase or write instruction the Wr ite Enable Latch (WEL) \nis automatically cleared to a write-disabled state of 0. \n \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write St atus Register instruction and \nsetting the Status Register Pr otect (SRP) and Block Protect (BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits. These \nsettings allow a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory array to be configured as \nread only. Used in conjunction with  the Write Protect (WP#) pin, changes to the Status Register \ncan be enabled or disabled under hardw are control. See St atus Register section for further \ninformation. Additionally, the Power-down instruct ion offers an extra level of write protection as \nall instructions are ignored except fo r the Release Power-down instruction. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             10 10. Status Register \nThe Read Status Register instruct ion can be used to prov ide status on the ava ilability of the Flash \nmemory array, if the device is write enabled or di sabled, the state of writ e protection, Security \nSector lock status. The Write Stat us Register instruction can be us ed to configure the device write \nprotection features and Security Sector OTP lo ck. Write access to the Status Register is \ncontrolled by the state of  the non-volatile Status Register Protect bit (SRP), the Write Enable \ninstruction, and the WP# pin. \n \nFactory default for all Stat us Register bits are 0. \n \nFigure 4 Status Register \n \n10.1. WIP Bit \nWIP is a read only bit in the status register (S 0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is \nexecuting a Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register. \nDuring this time the device will ignore further inst ructions except for t he Read Status Register \n(see t W, tPP, tSE, tBE, and t CE in “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). When the pro gram, erase or \nwrite status register (or security sector) instru ction has completed, the WIP bit will be cleared to a \n0 state indicating the device is r eady for further instructions.  \n \n10.2. Write Enable Latch bit (WEL) \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1 after \nexecuting a Write Enable Instructi on. The WEL status bit is clear ed to 0 when the device is write \ndisabled. A write disable state occurs upon power-up or after any of the following instructions: \nWrite Disable, Page Program, Sect or Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register. \n \n10.3. Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non-volatile read/write bits  in the status register (S4, \nS3, and S2) that provide Write Pr otection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             11 the Write Status Regist er Instruction (see t W in “12.6 AC Electrical Characte ristics”). All, none or \na portion of the memory array can be protect ed from Program and Erase instructions (see Table \n2 Status Register Memory Protecti on ). The factory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is \n0, none of the array protected. \n \n10.4. Top/Bottom Block Protect (TB) \nThe non-volatile Top/Bottom bit (T B) controls if the Block Prot ect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \nfrom the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in Table 2 Status Register \nMemory Pro\ntection table. The factory default se tting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the \nWrite Status Register Instruction dependi ng on the state of t he SRP and WEL bits. \n \n10.5. Status Register Protect bit / Lock_bit (SRP/LB) \nThe Status Register Protect (S RP) bit is operated in conjunction with the Write Protect (WP#) \nsignal. The Status Register Write Protect (SRP) bit and Write Protect (WP#) signal allow the \ndevice to be put in the Hardware  Protected mode (when t he Status Register Protect (SRP) bit is \nset to 1, and Write Protect (WP#) is driven Low). In  this mode, the non-volat ile bits of the Status \nRegister (SRP, BP2, BP1, BP0)  become read-only bits and the Wr ite Status Register (WRSR) \ninstruction is no longer accepted for execution. \nIn OTP mode, this bit is served as Lock_bit (LB), user can read/program/erase security sector as \nnormal sector while LB value is equal 0, after LB is programmed with 1 by WRSR command, the \nsecurity sector is protected from program and erase operation. The LB can only be programmed \nonce. \n \nNote : In OTP mode, the WRSR command will ignor e any input data and progr am LB to 1, user \nmust clear the protect bits before enter OT P mode and program the OTP code, then execute \nWRSR command to lock the Security  sector before leaving OTP mode. \n \n10.6.

Instructions \nThe Standard/Dual SPI instruction set of the FM25F 01 consists of 17 basic instructions that are \nfully controlled through the SPI bus (see Table 4~ Table 5 Instruction Set). Instructions are \ninitiated with the falling ed\nge of Chip Select (CS#).  The first byte of data cl ocked into the DI input \nprovides the instruction code. Data on the DI input is sampl ed on the rising edge of clock with \nmost significant bit (MSB) first. \n Instructions vary in length from a single byte  to several bytes and may be followed by address \nbytes, data bytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in  some cases, a combination. Instructions are \ncompleted with the rising edge of edge CS#. Cloc k relative timing diagrams for each instruction \nare included in Figure 5 through Figure 29. All read instructi ons can be \n completed after any \nclocked bit. However, all instructions that Writ e, Program or Erase must complete on a byte \nboundary (CS# driven high after a full 8-bits have been clocked) otherwise t he instruction will be \nignored. This feature further prot ects the device from inadvertent  writes.

Read Status Register (RDSR) (05h)  \nThe Read Status Register instructions allow the 8- bit Status Registers to be read. The instruction \nis entered by driving CS# low and shifting the inst ruction code “05h” into the DI pin on the rising \nedge of CLK. The status register  bits are then shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of \nCLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure 7. The Status Register bits are \nshown in Figure 4 and include the WIP, WEL, BP2-BP0 and SRP bits. \n \nThe Read Status Register instru ction \nmay be used at any time, even while a Program, Erase or \nWrite Status Register cycle is in progress. Th is allows the WIP status  bit to be checked to \ndetermine when the cycle is complete and if th e device can accept another instruction. The \nStatus Register can be read continuously. The instruction is  completed by driving CS# high. \nFigure 7 Read Status Register Instruction  \n \n11.7. Write Status Register (WRSR) (01h) \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR ) instruction allows the Status R egister to be written. Only non-\nvolatile Status Register bits SRP, BP2, BP1, BP0  can be written to. All ot her Status Register bit \nlocations are read-only and will not be a ffected by the Write Status Register (WRSR ) instruction. \nThe Status Register bits are shown in Figure 4, and described in 10 Status Register. \n To write no\nn-volatile Status Register bits , a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must \npreviously have been executed for the devic e to accept the Writ e Status Register (WRSR )  \ninstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). Once write enabled, t he instruction is entered \nby driving CS# low, sending the instruction code “01h”, and then writ ing the status register data \nbyte as illustrated in Figure 8. \n \nTo complete \nthe Write Status Register (WRSR ) instruction, the CS# pin must be driven high after \nthe eighth or sixteenth bit of data that is clocked in. If this is not done the Write Status Register \n(WRSR ) instruction will not be executed.  \n \nDuring non-volatile Status Register write operat ion (06h combined with 01h), after CS# is driven \nhigh, the self-timed Write Stat us Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See \n“12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”).  While the Write Status Regist er cycle is in progress, the \nRead Status Register instruction may still be acce ssed to check the status of the WIP bit. The \nWIP bit is a 1 during the Write Status Register cycle and a 0 when the cycle is finished and ready to accept other instructions again. After th e Write Status Register cycle has finished, the \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the St atus Register will be cleared to 0. \n \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             16 \n=MSBHigh ImpedanceCS#\nCLK\nD0\n(DQ 1)DI\n(DQ 0)\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (01h)8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 \nStatus Register in\n \nFigure 8 Write Status Register Instruction  \n \n11.8. Read Data (03h) \nThe Read Data instruction allows one or more data bytes to be sequentially read from the \nmemory. The instruction is initiated by drivi ng the CS# pin low and then shifting the instruction \ncode “03h” followed by a 24-bit address A23-A0 into the DI pin. The code and address bits are \nlatched on the rising edge of the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the \naddressed memory location will be shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The address is  automatically increm ented to the next higher \naddress after each byte of data is shifted out allowing for a continuous stream of data. This \nmeans that the entire memory c an be accessed with a single instruction as long as the clock \ncontinues. The instruction is co mpleted by driving CS# high. \n \nThe Read Data instructio n sequence is shown in Figure 9. If a Read Data instruction is issued \nwhile an Era \nse, Program or Write cycle is in pr ocess (WIP =1) the instruction is ignored and will \nnot have any effect on the current cycle. The Read Data instruction allows clock rates from D.C. \nto a maximum of f R (see “ 12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). \n The Read D\nata (03h) instruction is  only supported in Standard SPI mode. \nFigure 9 Read Data Instruction  \n \n11.9. Fast Read (0Bh) \nThe Fast Read instruction is similar to the Read Data  instruction except that  it can operate at the \nhighest possible frequency of F R (see “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristi cs”). T his is accomplished \nby adding eight “dummy” clocks after the 24-bit address as shown in Figure 10. The dummy \nclocks allow the devices internal  circuits additional time for setting up th\ne initial address. During \nthe dummy clocks the data value on the DI pin is a “don’t care”. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             17  \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode \n3\nMode \n0Instruction (0Bh)CS#\nCLK8       9      10              28     29     30     31 \n24-Bit Address\nD0\n(DQ 1)\n=MSBDI\n(DQ 0)\nHigh Impedance23     22     21               3       2       1       0 \n31     32     33     34     35     36      37     38 \nDummy ClocksCS#CLK\n39     40     41     42     43     44     45     46 47     48     49     50     51     52     53     54     55 \nD0\n(DQ 1)DI\n(DQ 0)\nHigh ImpedanceData Out 2\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 7\n 7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 Data Out 10\nFigure 10 Fast Read Instruction \n \n11.10. Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) \nThe Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) instructi on is similar to the standard Fast Read (0Bh) \ninstruction except that da ta is output on two pins; DQ 0 and DQ 1. This allows data to be \ntransferred from the FM25F01 at twice the rate  of standard SPI devices . The Fast Read Dual \nOutput instruction is ideal fo r quickly downloading code from Flash to RAM upon power-up or for \napplications that cache code-s egments to RAM for execution. \n \nSimilar to the Fast Read instruction, the Fast Read Dual Output instruction can operate at the \nhighest possible frequency of F R (see “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristi cs”). T his is accomplished \nby adding eight “dummy” clocks after the 24-bit address as shown in Figure 11. The dummy \nclocks allow the device'\ns internal  circuits additional time for setting up the initial address. The \ninput data during the dummy clocks is  “don’t care”. However, the DQ 0 pin should be high-\nimpedance prior to the falling edge of the first data out clock. \n \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             18 \nFigure 11 Fast Read Dual Output Instruction  \n \n11.11. Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) instruction allows  for improved random access while maintaining \ntwo I/O pins, DQ 0 and DQ 1. It is similar to the Fast Read Dual  Output (3Bh) instruction but with \nthe capability to input the Addre ss bits A23-A0 two bits per clock. This reduced instruction \noverhead may allow for code execution (XIP) direct ly from the Dual SPI in some applications. \n \nFast Read Dual I/O with “Continuous Read Mode” \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O instruction can further  reduce instruction overhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7-0) after t he input Address bits A23-A0, as shown in Figure 12. \nThe upper n\nibble of the (M7-4) c ontrols the length of the next Fa st Read Dual I/O instruction \nthrough the inclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction c ode. The lower nibble bits of the \n(M3-0) are don’t care (“x”). However, the DQ pins should be high-impedance prior to the falling \nedge of the first data out clock.  If the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5-4 = (1,0),  then the next Fast Read Dual I/O instruction \n(after CS# is raised and then lowered) does not  require the BBh instruction code, as shown \nin Figure 13. This reduces the in struction sequence by eight clo cks and allows the Read address\n  \nto be immediately entered after CS# is asserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5-4 do \nnot equal to (1,0), the next instruction (after CS# is raised and then lowe red) requires the first \nbyte instruction code, thus re turning to normal operation. It is recommended to input FFFFh on \nDQ 0 for the next instruction (16 clocks), to ens ure M4 = 1 and return the device to normal \noperation. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             19 0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (BBh)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ 0)8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 16     17     18     19     20     21     22     23 \n=MSB\nD0\n(DQ 1) 23      21    19     17     15     13     11      9 7       5       3       1       7       5       3       1 22     20     18     16     14     12     10      8 6       4       2       0       6       4       2       0 A23-16                   A15-8                     A7-0                    M7-0\n31     32     33     34     35     36     37     38     39CS#\nCLK\nD0\n(DQ 1)DI\n(DQ 0)\n7       5       3       1       7       5       3       1 7\n 7       5       3       1       7       5       3       1 \nByte 16       4       2       0       6       4       2       0 6 6       4       2       0       6       4       2       0 IOs switch from\nInput to Output\n0\nByte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4\n23     24     25     26     27     28     29     30\n1\nFigure 12 Fast Read Dual I/O Instruction (Initial instruction or previous M5-4 ≠ 10) \n \n \nFigure 13 Fast Read Dual I/O Instruction (Previous instruction set M5-4 = 10) \n \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             20 11.12. Page Program (02h) \nThe Page Program instruction allows from one byte to 256 bytes (a page) of data to be \nprogrammed at previously erased (FFh) memory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be \nexecuted before the device will acc ept the Page Program Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the CS # pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” \nfollowed by a 24-bit address A23-A0 and at least o ne data byte, into the DI pin. The CS# pin must \nbe held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device. The Page \nProgram instruction sequence is shown in Figure 14. \nIf an entire \n256 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant \naddress bits) should be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks exceeds the remaining page length, the addre ssing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In \nsome cases, less than 256 bytes (a partial page) can be programmed without having any effect \non other bytes within the same page. One condition to perform a partial page program is that the \nnumber of clocks can not exceed the remaining p age length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to \nthe device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page and overwrite previously sent \ndata. \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the \nlast byte has been latched. If th is is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. \nAfter CS# is driven high, the self-timed Page Program instruct ion will commence for a time \nduration of t\nPP (See “ 12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). While the Page Program cycle is in  \nprogress, the Read Status Regist er instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of \nthe WIP bit. The WIP bit is a 1 during the Page Program cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is \nfinished and the device is ready to accept other instructions agai n. After the Page Program cycle \nhas finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Page \nProgram instruction will not be executed if the addressed page is protected by the Block Protect \n(BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits. \nFigure 14 Page Program Instruction \n \n11.13. Sector Erase (20h) \nThe Sector Erase instruction sets all memory with in a specified sector (4K-bytes) to the erased \nstate of all 1s (FFh). A Write Enable instruct ion must be executed befor e the device will accept \nthe Sector Erase Instruction (Statu s Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low and shifting the instruct ion code “20h” followed a 24-bit sector address \nA23-A0 (see Figure 1). The Sector Erase in struction sequence is shown in Figure 15 . \n \nThe CS# pin \nmust be driven high after the eighth bit of  the last byte has been latched.

After CS# is driven high, the self-timed \nSector Erase instruction will co mmence for a time duration of t SE (See “12.6 AC Electrical \nCharacteristics”). While the Sector Erase cycl e is in progr\ness, the Read Status Register \ninstruction may still be accessed for checking the st atus of the WIP bit. Th e WIP bit is a 1 during \nthe Sector Erase cycle and becom es a 0 when the cycle is fini shed and the device is ready to \naccept other instructions again. After the Sector Erase cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch \n(WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Sector Erase instruction will not be executed \nif the addressed page is protec ted by the Block Protect (BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits (see Table \n2 Status Register Memory Protection table). \nFigure 15 Sector Erase Instruction  \n \n11.14. 32KB Block Erase (BE32) (52h) \nThe 32KB Block Erase instruction sets all memory  within a specified bl ock (32K-bytes) to the \nerased state of all 1s (FFh). A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will \naccept the Block Erase Instruction (Status Regi ster bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the instruction code “52h” followed a 24-bit block \naddress A23-A0. The Block Erase in struction sequence is shown in Figure 16. \n \nThe CS# pin \nmust be driven high after the eighth bit of  the last byte has been latched. If this is not \ndone the Block Erase instruction will not be executed. After CS# is driven  high, the self-timed \nBlock Erase instruction will commence for a time duration of t BE2 (See 12.6 AC Electrical \nCharacteristics”). While the Block Era\nse cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction \nmay still be accessed for checking the status of t he WIP bit. The WIP bit is a 1 during the Block \nErase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is r eady to accept other \ninstructions again.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will \naccept the Block Erase Instruction (Status Regi ster bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the instruction code “D8h” followed a 24-bit block \naddress A23-A0. The Block Erase in struction sequence is shown in Figure 17. \n \nThe CS# pin \nmust be driven high after the eighth bit of  the last byte has been latched. If this is not \ndone the Block Erase instruction will not be executed. After CS# is driven  high, the self-timed \nBlock Erase instruction will commence for a time duration of t BE1 (See 12.6 AC Electrical \nCharacteristics”). While the Block Era\nse cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction \nmay still be accessed for checking the status of t he WIP bit. The WIP bit is a 1 during the Block \nErase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is r eady to accept other \ninstructions again. After the Block Erase cycle has  finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in \nthe Status Register is cleared to 0. The Block Erase instruct ion will not be executed if the \naddressed page is protected by the Block Protect (BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits (see Table 2 Status \nRegister Memory Protection table). \nFigure 17 Block Erase Instruction  \n \n11.16. Chip Erase (CE) (C7h / 60h) \nThe Chip Erase instruction sets a ll memory within the device to the erased state of all 1s (FFh). A \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             23 Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept  the Chip Erase \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# \npin low and shifting the instruction code “C7h” or  “60h”. The Chip Erase instruction sequence is \nshown in Figure 18. \n \nThe CS# pin\n must be driven high after the eighth bi t has been latched. If this  is not done the Chip \nErase instruction will not be ex ecuted. After CS# is driven hi gh, the self-timed Chip Erase \ninstruction will commence for a time duration of t CE (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). \nWhile the Chip Erase cycle is in pr\nogress, t he Read Status Register instruction may still be \naccessed to check the status of the WIP bit. Th e WIP bit is a 1 during the Chip Erase cycle and \nbecomes a 0 when finished and the device is ready to accept other  instructions again. After the \nChip Erase cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch  (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared \nto 0. The Chip Erase instruction will not be executed if any page is  protected by the Block Protect \n(BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits. \n \nFigure 18 Chip Erase Instruction \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             24 11.17. Power-down (B9h) \nAlthough the standby current during normal operation is relatively low, standby current can be \nfurther reduced with the Power-down instruct ion. The lower power consumption makes the \nPower-down instruction espec ially useful for battery powered applications (See I CC1 and I CC2 \nin 12.4 DC Electrical Characteristics”).  The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in Figure 19. \n \nThe CS# pin must be\n driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the \nPower-down instruction will not be executed. After CS# is driven high, the power-down state will \nenter within the time duration of t DP (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characterist ics”). While in  the power-\ndown state only the Release from Power- down / Devi ce ID instruction, which restores the device \nto normal operation, will be recogniz ed. All other instructions are ignored. This includes the Read \nStatus Register instruction, wh ich is always available during normal operation. Ignoring all but \none instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condition for securing maximum write \nprotection. The device always powers-up in the normal operation with the standby current of I CC1. \nFigure 19 Deep Power-down Instruction  \n \n11.18. Release Power-down / Device ID (ABh) \nThe Release from Power-down / Device ID instruction is a multi-purpose instruction. It can be \nused to release the device from the power-down state, or obtain the devices electronic \nidentification (ID) number.  To release the device from the pow er-down state, the instruction is  issued by driving the CS# pin \nlow, shifting the instruction code “ ABh” and driving CS# high as shown in Figure 20. Release from \npower-down will take\n the time duration of t RES1 (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”) before \nthe device will resume normal operati\non and other instructions are accept ed. The CS# pin must \nremain high during the t RES1 time duration. \n \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power-down state,  the instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifti ng the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3-dummy \nbytes. The Device ID bits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit \n(MSB) first as shown in Figure 20. The Device ID val ue for the FM25F01 is listed in Table \n3 Manufacturer and Device Identification table. The Device ID  can be read continuously. The \ninstruction is \ncompleted by driving CS# high. \n \nWhen used to release the devic e from the power-down state and obtain the Device ID, the \ninstruction is the same as pr eviously described, and shown in Figure 21, except that after CS# is \ndriven \nhigh it must remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See “12.6 AC Electrical \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             25 Characteristics”). After this time duration the device will re sume normal operation and other \ninstructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power-down / Device ID instruction is issued \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in  process (when WIP equals 1) the instruction is \nignored and will not have any effect on the current cycle. \ntRES1\n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3Mode 0\nInstruction (ABh)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ 0)\nPower-down current Stand-by current\nFigure 20 Release Power-down Instruction  \n \nFigure 21 Release Power-down / Device ID Instruction  \n \n11.19. Read Manufacturer / Device ID (90h) \nThe Read Manufacturer/Device ID in struction is an alternative to  the Release from Power-down / \nDevice ID instruction that provides both t he JEDEC assigned manufacture r ID and the specific \ndevice ID. \n The Read Manufacturer/Device ID instruction is very similar to the Release from Power-down / \nDevice ID instruction. The instruction is init iated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “90h” followed by a 24-bit address A23-A0 of 000000h. After which, the \nManufacturer ID for Shanghai Fudan Microelectr onics Group Co., Ltd (A1h) and the Device ID \nare shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with mo st significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure \n22. The De \nvice ID value fo r the FM25F01 is listed in Table 3 Manufacturer and Device \nIdentification\n table. If the 24-bit address is initially set to  000001h the Device ID will be read first \nand then followed by the Manufacturer ID. T he Manufacturer and Device IDs can be read \ncontinuously, alternating from one to  the other. The instruction is completed by driving CS# high. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F01 1M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY                     Ver. 1.4                                                             26 DI\n(DQ 1)DI\n(DQ 0)CS#\nCLK\nInstruction (90h)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 08       9      10\nAddress (000000h)28     29     30     31\n23     22     21                              3       2       1       0                 \n=MSBHigh Impedance\n31     32     33     34     35     36     37     38 39     40     41     42     43     44     45     46 \n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0  \nDevice ID0Mode 3\nMode 0\nManufacturer ID CS#\nCLK\nD0\n(DQ 1)DI\n(DQ 0)\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0  \n \nFigure 22 Read Manufacturer / Device ID Instruction  \n \n11.20.

The ID number can be used in conjunction with user software \nmethods to help prevent copying or cloning of a system. The Read Unique ID instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the instruction code “4Bh” followed by a four bytes \nof dummy clocks.
