General description\nThe LPC2131/32/34/36/38 microcontrollers are based on a 16/32-bit ARM7TDMI-S CPU \nwith real-time emulation and embedded trace s upport, that combine the microcontroller \nwith 32 kB, 64 kB, 128 kB, 256 kB and 512 kB of embedded high-speed flash memory. A \n128-bit wide memory interface and a unique accelerator architecture enable 32-bit code \nexecution at maximum clock rate. For critical c ode size applications, the alternative 16-bit \nThumb mode reduces code by more than 30 % with minimal performance penalty.\nDue to their tiny size and low power consumption, these microcontrollers are ideal for \napplications where miniaturization is a key requirement, such as access control and \npoint-of-sale. With a wide range of serial  communications interfaces and on-chip SRAM \noptions of 8 kB, 16 kB, and 32 kB, they are very well suited for communication gateways and protocol converters, soft modems, voice recognition and low-end imaging, providing both large buffer size and high processing power. Various 32-bit timers, single or dual \n10-bit 8-channel ADC(s) , 10-bit DAC, PWM channels and 47 GPIO lines with up to nine \nedge or level sensitive external interrupt pi ns make these microcontrollers particularly \nsuitable for industrial co ntrol and medical systems.\n2. Features and benefits\n2.1 Enhancements brought by LPC213x/01 devices\n\uf06eFast GPIO ports enable port pin toggling up to 3.5 times faster than the original \nLPC213x. They also allow for a port pin to be read at any time regardless of its function.\n\uf06eDedicated result registers for ADC(s) reduce interrupt overhead.\n\uf06eUART0/1 include fractional baud rate generat or, auto-bauding capabilities and \nhandshake flow-control fully implemented in hardware.\n\uf06eAdditional BOD control enables furthe r reduction of po wer consumption.\n2.2 Key features common fo r LPC213x and LPC213x/01 \n\uf06e16/32-bit ARM7TDMI-S microcontroller in  a tiny LQFP64 or HVQFN64 package.\n\uf06e8/16/32 kB of on-chip static RAM and 32/ 64/128/256/512 kB of on-chip flash program \nmemory. 128-bit wide interface/accelerator enables high-speed 60 MHz operation.\n\uf06eIn-System Programming/In-Application Progra mming (ISP/IAP) via on-chip bootloader \nsoftware.

Functional description\n6.1 Architectural overview\nThe ARM7TDMI-S is a general purpose 32-b it microprocessor, which offers high \nperformance and very low power consumpt ion. The ARM architecture is based on \nReduced Instruction Set Comput er (RISC) principles, and the instruction set and related \ndecode mechanism are much simpler than those of microprogrammed Complex \nInstruction Set Computers. This simplicity re sults in a high instruction throughput and \nimpressive real-time interrupt response from  a small and cost-effective processor core.\nPipeline techniques are employed so that all parts of the processing and memory systems \ncan operate continuously. Typically, while one instruction is being executed, its successor is being decoded, and a third instruction is being fetched from memory.\nThe ARM7TDMI-S processor also employs a unique architectural strategy known as \nThumb, which makes it ideally suited to  high-volume applications with memory \nrestrictions, or applications where code density is an issue.The key idea behind Thumb is that of a super-reduced instruction set. Essentially, the \nARM7TDMI-S processor has two instruction sets:\n•The standard 32-bit ARM set.\n•A 16-bit Thumb set.\nThe Thumb set’s 16-bit instru ction length allows it to approach twice the density of \nstandard ARM code while retaining most of the ARM’s performance advantage over a \ntraditional 16-bit processor using 16-bit registers. This is possible because Thumb code operates on the same 32-bit register set as ARM code.\nThumb code is able to provide up to 65 % of the code size of ARM, and 160 % of the \nperformance of an equivalent ARM processo r connected to a 16-bit memory system.\n6.2 On-chip flash program memory\nThe LPC2131/32/34/36/38 incorporate a 32 kB, 64 kB, 128 kB, 256 kB and 512 kB flash \nmemory system respectively. This memory may be used for both code and data storage. Programming of the flash memory may be accomplished in several ways. It may be \nprogrammed In System via the serial port. The application program may also erase and/or \nprogram the flash while the application is running, allowing a great degree of flexibility for \ndata storage field firmware upgrades, et c. When the LPC2131/32/34/36/38 on-chip \nbootloader is used, 32/64/128/256/500 kB of  flash memory is available for user code.\nThe LPC2131/32/34/36/38 flash memory pr ovides a minimum of 100000 erase/write \ncycles and 20 years of data-retention.\n6.3 On-chip static RAM\nOn-chip static RAM may be used for code  and/or data storage. The SRAM may be \naccessed as 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit. The LPC2131, LPC2132/34, and LPC2136/38 \nprovide 8 kB, 16 kB and 32 kB of static RAM respectively.\nLPC2131_32_34_36_38 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2011.

The programmable assignment scheme means that priorities of interrupts fr om the various peripherals can be dynamically \nassigned and adjusted.\nFIQ has the highest priority. If more than one request is assigned to FIQ, the VIC \ncombines the requests to produce the FIQ signal to the ARM processor. The fastest \npossible FIQ latency is achieved when only one  request is classified as FIQ, because then \nthe FIQ service routine can simply start dea ling with that device. But if more than one \nrequest is assigned to the FIQ class, the FIQ service routine can read a word from the VIC \nthat identifies which FIQ source(s) is (are) requesting an interrupt.\nVectored IRQs have the middle priority. Sixtee n of the interrupt requests can be assigned \nto this category. Any of the interrupt requests can be assigned to any of the 16 vectored \nIRQ slots, among which slot 0 has the highest priority and slot 15 has the lowest. \nNon-vectored IRQs have the lowest priority.\nThe VIC combines the requests from all the vectored and non-vectored IRQs to produce \nthe IRQ signal to the ARM processor. The IRQ service routine can start by reading a \nregister from the VIC and jumping there. If any of the vectored IRQs are requesting, the \nVIC provides the address of the highest-pr iority requesting IRQs service routine, \notherwise it provides the address of a default routine that is shared by all the non-vectored \nIRQs. The default routine can read another VI C register to see what IRQs are active.\n6.5.1 Interrupt sources\nTable 4  lists the interrupt sources for each peripheral function. Each peripheral device has \none interrupt line connected to the Vectored Interrupt Controller, but may have several internal interrupt flags. Individual interrupt flags may also represent more than one \ninterrupt source.\n Table 4.

Each device is recognized by a unique address and \ncan operate as either a receiver-only device (e .g., an LCD driver or a transmitter with the \ncapability to both receive and send information (such as me mory)). Transmitters and/or \nreceivers can operate in either master or sl ave mode, depending on whether the chip has \nto initiate a data transfer or is only addressed. The I2C-bus is a multi-mast er bus, it can be \ncontrolled by more than one bus master connected to it.\nThis I2C-bus implementation supports bit rates up to 400 kbit/s (Fast I2C). \n6.11.1 Features\n•Standard I2C compliant bus interface.\n•Easy to configure as Master, Slave, or Master/Slave.\n•Programmable clocks allow versatile rate control.\n•Bidirectional data transfer between masters and slaves.\n•Multi-master bus (no central master).\n•Arbitration between simultaneously transmit ting masters without corruption of serial \ndata on the bus.\n•Serial clock synchronization allows devices with different bit rates to communicate via \none serial bus.\n•Serial clock synchronization can be used as a handshake mechanism to suspend and \nresume serial transfer.\n•The I2C-bus may be used for test and diagnostic purposes.\n6.12 SPI serial I/O controller\nThe LPC2131/32/34/36/38 each contain one SPI controller.

It can \ninteract with multiple masters and slaves on the bus. However, only a single master and a \nsingle slave can communicate on the bus during a given da ta transfer. The SSP supports \nfull duplex transfers, with frames of 4 bits to 16  bits of data flowing from the master to the \nslave and from the slave to the master.

It also includes four capture inputs \nto trap the timer value when an input signal transitions, optionally generating an interrupt. \nMultiple pins can be selected to perform a si ngle capture or match function, providing an \napplication with ‘or’ and ‘and’, as well as ‘broadcast’ functions among them.\nAt any given time only one of peripheral’s ca pture inputs can be selected as an external \nevent signal source, i.e., timer’s clock. Th e rate of external events that can be \nsuccessfully counted is limited to PCLK/2. In this configuration, unused capture lines can \nbe selected as regular timer capture inputs.\n6.14.1 Features\n•A 32-bit Timer/Counter with a programmable 32-bit Prescaler.\n•External Event Counter or timer operation.\n•Four 32-bit capture channels per timer/counte r that can take a snapshot of the timer \nvalue when an input signal transitions.

When enabl ed, the watchdog w ill generate a system \nreset if the user program fails to ‘feed’ (o r reload) the watchdog within a predetermined \namount of time.\n6.15.1 Features\n•Internally resets chip if not period ically reloaded.\n•Debug mode.\n•Enabled by software but requires a hardware reset or a watchdog reset/interrupt to be \ndisabled.\n•Incorrect/Incomplete feed sequence causes reset/interrupt if enabled.\n•Flag to indicate watchdog reset.\n•Programmable 32-bit timer with internal pre-scaler.\n•Selectable time period from (T cy(PCLK)\uf0b4 256\uf0b4 4) to (T cy(PCLK)\uf0b4 232\uf0b4 4) in multiples of \nTcy(PCLK)\uf0b44.\n6.16 Real-time clock\nThe Real-Time Clock (RTC) is designed to pr ovide a set of counters to measure time \nwhen normal or idle operating mode is selected. The RTC has been designed to use little power, making it suitable for battery powered systems where the CPU is not running \ncontinuously (Idle mode).\n6.16.1 Features\n•Measures the passage of time to maintain a calendar and clock.\n•Ultra-low power design to support battery powered systems.\n•Provides Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Day of Month, Month, Year, Day of Week, and \nDay of Year.\n•Can use either the RTC dedicated 32 kHz oscillator input or clock derived from the \nexternal crystal/oscillator input at XTAL 1.

All rights reserv ed.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 5.1 — 29 July 2011 21 of 45NXP Semiconductors LPC2131/32/34/36/38\nSingle-chip 16/32-bit microcontrollers\n6.17 Pulse width modulator\nThe PWM is based on the standard Timer block and inherits all of its features, although \nonly the PWM function is pinned out on th e LPC2131/32/34/36/38. The Timer is designed \nto count cycles of the peripheral clock (P CLK) and optionally generate interrupts or \nperform other actions when specified timer values occur, based on seven match registers. The PWM function is also based on match register events.\nThe ability to separately contro l rising and falling edge locations allo ws the PWM to be \nused for more applications. For instance, mu lti-phase motor control typically requires \nthree non-overlapping PWM outputs with individual control of all three pulse widths and \npositions.\nTwo match registers can be used to provide a single edge controlled PWM output. One \nmatch register (MR0) controls the PWM cycl e rate, by resetting the count upon match. \nThe other match register controls the PW M edge position. Additional single edge \ncontrolled PWM outputs require only one match re gister each, since the repetition rate is \nthe same for all PWM outputs.  Multiple single edge contro lled PWM outputs will all have a \nrising edge at the beginning of each PWM cycle, when an MR0 match occurs.\nThree match registers can be used to provid e a PWM output with both edges controlled. \nAgain, the MR0 match register controls th e PWM cycle rate. The other match registers \ncontrol the two PWM edge positions. Additi onal double edge controlled PWM outputs \nrequire only two match registers each, since the repetition rate is the same for all PWM \noutputs.\nWith double edge controlled PWM outputs, spec ific match registers control the rising and \nfalling edge of the output. This allows both positive going PWM pulses (when the rising \nedge occurs prior to the falling edge), and negative goi ng PWM pulses (when the falling \nedge occurs prior to the rising edge).\n6.17.1 Features\n•Seven match registers allow up to six single edge controlled or three double edge \ncontrolled PWM outputs, or a mix of both types.\n•The match registers also allow:\n–Continuous operation with optional interrupt generation on match.\n–Stop timer on match with optional interrupt generation.\n–Reset timer on match with optional interrupt generation.\n•Supports single edge controlled and/or double edge controlled PWM outputs. Single \nedge controlled PWM outputs all go HIGH at the beginning of each cycle unless the \noutput is a constant LOW. Double edge controlled PWM outputs can have either edge \noccur at any position within a cycle. This a llows for both positive going and negative \ngoing pulses.\n•Pulse period and width can be any number of timer counts. This allows complete \nflexibility in the trad e-off between resolution and re petition rate. All PWM outputs will \noccur at the same repetition rate.\n•Double edge controlled PWM outputs can be programmed to be either positive going or negative going pulses.\nLPC2131_32_34_36_38 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2011.

Software must ‘release’ new match values before they can become \neffective.\n•May be used as a standard timer if the PWM mode is not enabled.\n•A 32-bit Timer/Counter with a programmable 32-bit Prescaler.\n6.18 System control\n6.18.1 Crystal oscillator\nOn-chip integrated osc illator operates with external cryst al in range of 1 MHz to 30 MHz \nand with external oscillator up to 50 MHz. The oscillator ou tput frequency is called f osc and \nthe ARM processor clock frequency is referred to as CCLK for purposes of rate equations, \netc. f osc and CCLK are the same value unless the PLL is running and connected. Refer to \nSection 6.18.2 “ PLL” for additional information.\n6.18.2 PLL\nThe PLL accepts an input clock frequency in the range of 10 MHz to 25 MHz. The input \nfrequency is multiplied up into the range of 10 MHz to 60 MHz with a Current Controlled \nOscillator (CCO). The mu ltiplier can be an integer value from 1 to 32 (in practice, the \nmultiplier value cannot be higher than 6 on this family of microcontrollers due to the upper \nfrequency limit of the CPU). The CCO operates in the range of 156 MHz to 320 MHz, so \nthere is an additional divider in the loop to keep the CCO within its frequency range while the PLL is providing the desired output frequenc y. The output divider may be set to divide \nby 2, 4, 8, or 16 to produce the output clock. Since the minimum output divider value is 2, it is insured that the PLL output has a 50 % duty cycle. The PLL is turned off and \nbypassed following a chip reset and may be enabled by software. The program must \nconfigure and activate the PLL, wait for the PLL to Lock, then connect to the PLL as a \nclock source. The PLL settling time is 100 \uf06ds.\n6.18.3 Reset and wake-up timer\nReset has two source s on the LPC2131/32/34/36/38: the RESET  pin and watchdog reset. \nThe RESET  pin is a Schmitt trigger input pin with an additional glitch filter. Assertion of \nchip reset by any source starts the wake-up timer (see wake-up timer description below), causing the internal chip reset to remain asserted until the external reset is de-asserted, \nthe oscillator is running, a fixed number of  clocks have passed, and the on-chip flash \ncontroller has complete d its initialization.\nWhen the internal reset is removed, the proces sor begins executing at address 0, which is \nthe reset vector. At that point, all of the processor and peripheral registers have been \ninitialized to predetermined values.\nThe wake-up timer ensures that  the oscillator and other analog functions required for chip \noperation are fully functional before the proce ssor is allowed to exec ute instructions. This \nis important at power on, all types of reset, and whenever any of the aforementioned \nfunctions are turned off for any reason. Since the oscillator and other functions are turned \noff during Power-down mode, any wake-up of the processor from Power-down mode \nmakes use of the wake-up timer.\nLPC2131_32_34_36_38 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2011. All rights reserv ed.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 5.1 — 29 July 2011 23 of 45NXP Semiconductors LPC2131/32/34/36/38\nSingle-chip 16/32-bit microcontrollers\nThe wake-up timer monitors the crystal oscillator as the means of checking whether it is \nsafe to begin code execution. When power is  applied to the chip, or some event caused \nthe chip to exit Powe r-down mode, some time  is required for the oscillator to produce a \nsignal of sufficient amplitude to drive the clock logic. The amount of time depends on \nmany factors, including the rate of V DD ramp (in the case of power on), the type of crystal \nand its electrical characteristics (if a quartz cr ystal is used), as well as any other external \ncircuitry (e.g. capacitors), and the characteristics of the oscilla tor itself under the existing \nambient conditions.\n6.18.4 Brownout detector\nThe LPC2131/32/34/36/38 include 2-stage monitoring of the voltage on the V DD pins. If \nthis voltage falls below 2.9 V, the BOD asserts an  interrupt signal to the Vectored Interrupt \nController. This signal can be enabled for interrupt; if not, software can monitor the signal \nby reading dedicated register.\nThe second stage of low-voltage detection asserts reset to inactivate the \nLPC2131/32/34/36/38 when the voltage on the V DD pins falls below 2.6 V. This reset \nprevents alteration of the flash as operation of the various elements of the chip would otherwise become unreliable due to low volt age. The BOD circuit maintains this reset \ndown below 1 V, at which point the POR circuitry maintains the overall reset.\nBoth the 2.9 V and 2.6 V thresholds include some hysteresis. In normal operation, this \nhysteresis allows the 2.9 V detection to relia bly interrupt, or a regularly-executed event \nloop to sense the condition.Features available only in LP C213x/01 parts include ability to  put the BOD in power-down \nmode, turn it on or off and to control when the BOD will reset the LPC213x/01 \nmicrocontroller. This can be used to further reduce power consumption when a low power \nmode (such as Power Down) is invoked.\n6.18.5 Code security\nThis feature of the LPC2131/32/ 34/36/38 allow an application to control whether it can be \ndebugged or protected from observation.\nIf after reset on-chip bootloader detects a valid checksum in flash and reads 0x8765 4321 \nfrom address 0x1F C in flash, debugging will be disabled and thus the code in flash will be \nprotected from observation. Once debugging is disabled, it can be enabled only by performing a full chip erase using the ISP.\n6.18.6 External interrupt inputs\nThe LPC2131/32/34/36/38 include up to nine edge or level sensitive External Interrupt \nInputs as selectable pin functions. When the pins are combined, external events can be \nprocessed as four independent interrupt si gnals. The External Interrupt Inputs can \noptionally be used to wake up the processor from Power-down mode.\n6.18.7 Memory Mapping Control\nThe Memory Mapping Control alters the mapping of the interrupt vectors that appear \nbeginning at address 0x0000 0000. Vectors may be mapped to the bottom of the on-chip \nflash memory, or to the on-chip static RAM. This allows code runnin g in different memory \nspaces to have control of the interrupts.\nLPC2131_32_34_36_38 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2011. All rights reserv ed.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 5.1 — 29 July 2011 24 of 45NXP Semiconductors LPC2131/32/34/36/38\nSingle-chip 16/32-bit microcontrollers\n6.18.8 Power Control\nThe LPC2131/32/34/36/38 support two reduced power modes: Idle mode and \nPower-down mode.\nIn Idle mode, execution of instructions is suspended until either a reset or interrupt occurs. \nPeripheral functions continue operation during Idle mode and may generate interrupts to \ncause the processor to resume execution. Idle mode eliminates power used by the \nprocessor itself, memory systems and related controllers, and internal buses.\nIn Power-down mode, the oscillator is shut down and the chip receives no internal clocks. \nThe processor state and registers, peripheral registers, and internal SRAM values are \npreserved throughout Power-down mode and th e logic levels of chip output pins remain \nstatic. The Power-down mode can be terminated and normal operation resumed by either \na reset or certain specific interrupts that are able to function without clocks. Since all \ndynamic operation of the chip is suspended, Power-down mode reduces chip power \nconsumption to nearly zero.\nSelecting an external 32 kHz clock instead of the PCLK as a clock-source for the on-chip \nRTC will enable the microcontroller to have the RTC active during Power-down mode. \nPower-down current is increased with RTC active. However, it is significantly lower than in \nIdle mode.\nA Power Control for Peripherals feature allows individual peripherals to be turned off if \nthey are not needed in the application, resulting in additional power savings.\n6.18.9 APB bus\nThe APB divider determines the relationship between the proc essor clock (CCLK) and the \nclock used by peripheral devices (PCLK). The APB divider serv es two purposes. The first \nis to provide peripher als with the desired PCLK via APB bu s so that they can operate at \nthe speed chos en for the ARM processor. In order to achieve this, the APB bus may be \nslowed down to 1⁄2 to 1⁄4 of the processor clock rate. Because the APB bus must work \nproperly at power-up (and its timing cannot be  altered if it does not work since the APB \ndivider control registers reside on the APB bus), the default condition at reset is for the APB bus to run at \n1⁄4 of the processor clock rate. The second purpose of  the APB divider \nis to allow power savings when an application does not require any peripherals to run at \nthe full processor rate. Because the APB divider is connected to the PLL output, the PLL remains active (if it was running) during Idle mode.\n6.19 Emulation and debugging\nThe LPC2131/32/34/36/38 supp ort emulation and debugging via a JTAG serial port. A \ntrace port allows tracing program execution. Debugging and trace functions are \nmultiplexed only with GPIOs on Port 1. Th is means that all communication, timer and \ninterface peripherals residing on Port 0 are available during the development and debugging phase as they are when the applicat ion is run in the embedded system itself.\n6.19.1 EmbeddedICE\nStandard ARM EmbeddedICE logic provides on-chip debug support. The debugging of the target system requires a host computer running the debugger software and an EmbeddedICE protocol convertor. EmbeddedICE protocol convertor converts the Remote \nDebug Protocol commands to the JTAG data needed to access the ARM core.\nLPC2131_32_34_36_38 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2011. All rights reserv ed.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 5.1 — 29 July 2011 25 of 45NXP Semiconductors LPC2131/32/34/36/38\nSingle-chip 16/32-bit microcontrollers\nThe ARM core has a Debug Communication Channel function built-in. The debug \ncommunication channel allows a program running on the target to communicate with the \nhost debugger or another separate host without stopping the program flow or even entering the debug state. The debug communication channel is accessed as a \nco-processor 14 by the program running on the ARM7TDMI-S core. The debug \ncommunication channel allows the JTAG port to be used for sending and receiving data without affecting the normal program flow. The debug communication channel data and \ncontrol registers are mapped in to addresses in the EmbeddedICE logic.\n6.19.2 Embedded trace\nSince the LPC2131/32/34/36/38 have significa nt amounts of on-chip memory, it is not \npossible to determine how the processor core is operating simply by observing the \nexternal pins. The Embedded Trace Macrocell provides re al-time trace capability for \ndeeply embedded processor cores. It outputs information about processor execution to \nthe trace port.\nThe ETM is connected directly to the ARM core and not to the main AMBA system bus. It \ncompresses the trace information and exports it  through a narrow trace port. An external \ntrace port analyzer must capture the trace information under software debugger control. \nInstruction trace (or PC trace) shows the flow of execution of the processor and provides a \nlist of all the instructions that  were executed. Instruction trace is significantly compressed \nby only broadcasting branch addresses as well as a set of status signals that indicate the pipeline status on a cycle by cycle basis. Trace information generation can be controlled \nby selecting the trigger resource. Trigger resources include address comparators, counters and sequencers. Since trace information is compressed the software debugger requires a static image of the code being exec uted. Self-modifying code can not be traced \nbecause of this restriction.\n6.19.3 RealMonitor\nRealMonitor is a configurable software module, developed by ARM Inc., which enables \nreal time debug. It is a lightweight debug monitor that runs in the background while users \ndebug their foreground application. It communi cates with the host using the DCC, which is \npresent in the EmbeddedICE logic. The LPC2131/32/34/36/38 contain a specific \nconfiguration of RealMonitor software programmed into the on-chip flash memory.\nLPC2131_32_34_36_38 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2011.

Application information\n12.1 Crystal oscillator XTAL input and component selection\nThe input voltage to the on-chip oscillators is limited to 1.8 V. If the oscillator is driven by a \nclock in slave mode, it is recommended that th e input be coupled through a capacitor with \nCi = 100 pF. To limit the input voltage to the specified range, choose an additional \ncapacitor to ground C g which attenuates the input voltage by a factor C i / (C i + C g). In \nslave mode, a minimum of 200 mV (RMS) is needed. \n \nIn slave mode the input clock signal should be  coupled by means of a capacitor of 100 pF \n(Figure 13 ), with an amplitude between 200 mV (RMS) and 1000 mV (RMS). This \ncorresponds to a square wave signal with a signal swing of between 280 mV and 1.4 V. \nThe XTAL2 pin in this configurat ion can be left unconnected. \nExternal components and models used  in oscillation mode are shown in Figure 14  and in \nTable 10  and Table 11 . Since the feedback resistance is integrated on chip, only a crystal \nand the capacitances C X1 and C X2 need to be connected externally in case of \nfundamental mode oscillation  (the fundamental frequenc y is represen ted by L, C L and \nRS). Capacitance C P in Figure 14  represents the parallel package capacitance and should \nnot be larger than 7 pF. Parameters F OSC, CL, RS and C P are supplied by the crystal \nmanufacturer.Fig 13.

Since the feedback resistance is \nintegrated on chip, only a crystal, the capacitances C X1 and C X2 need to be connected \nexternally to the microcontroller.\nTable 12  gives the crystal parameters that should be used. C L is the typical load \ncapacitance of the crystal and is usually specified by the crystal manufacturer. The actual \nCL influences oscillation freq uency. When using a crystal that is manufactured for a \ndifferent load capacitance, the circuit will os cillate at a slightly  different frequency \n(depending on the quality of the crystal) comp ared to the specified one. Therefore for an \naccurate time reference it is advised to use the load capacitors as specified in Table 12  \nthat belong to a specific C L. The value of external capacitances C X1 and C X2 specified in \nthis table are calculated from the internal parasitic capacitances and the C L. Parasitics \nfrom PCB and package are not taken into account.\n \n12.3 XTAL and RTCX Printed Circui t Board (PCB) layout guidelines\nThe crystal should be connected on the PCB as close as poss ible to the oscillator input \nand output pins of the chip. Take care that the load capacitors C x1, Cx2, and C x3 in case of \nthird overtone crystal usage have a common ground plane. The external components must also be connected to the ground plane. Loops must be made as small as possible in \norder to keep the noise coupled in via the PCB as small as possible. Also parasitics \nshould stay as small as  possible. Values of C\nx1 and C x2 should be chosen smaller \naccordingly to the increase in parasitics of the PCB layout. Fig 15.
