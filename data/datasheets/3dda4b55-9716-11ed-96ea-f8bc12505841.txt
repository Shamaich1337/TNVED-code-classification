!==============================================================================!
Based on the provided product code RSSHG-251-165 from MEMORY PROTECTION DEVICES INC, here is a concise summary of the component's key characteristics and specifications:

### Key Specifications:
- **Voltage Ratings**: 25V
- **Current Ratings**: 1.65A
- **Power Consumption**: Typically low, specific values may vary based on application.
- **Operating Temperature Range**: -40°C to +85°C
- **Package Type**: Surface Mount Device (SMD)
- **Special Features or Notes**: This component is designed for overcurrent protection and is resettable, meaning it can return to its normal state after the fault condition is removed.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL)**: MSL 1 per JEDEC J-STD-020E, indicating that the component is not sensitive to moisture and does not require special handling.

### Component Description:
The RSSHG-251-165 is a resettable fuse, also known as a polyfuse or polymeric positive temperature coefficient (PPTC) device. Its primary function is to provide overcurrent protection in electronic circuits. When the current exceeds a certain threshold, the device increases its resistance significantly, effectively interrupting the circuit and preventing damage to downstream components.

### Typical Applications:
The RSSHG-251-165 is commonly used in various applications, including:
- **Power Management**: Protecting power supply circuits from overcurrent conditions.
- **Consumer Electronics**: Safeguarding devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
- **Automotive Applications**: Providing protection in automotive electronics against short circuits and overloads.
- **Industrial Equipment**: Ensuring the safety of machinery and equipment by preventing excessive current flow.

This component is essential for enhancing the reliability and safety of electronic devices by preventing damage due to overcurrent situations.
