It provides a wider dynamic range and better accuracy than possible using discrete diode detectors. In \nparticular, its temperature stability is excellent over the full \noperating range of −40°C to +85°C.  \nIts high sensitivity allows control at low power levels, thus reducing the amount of power that needs to be coupled to the detector. It is essentially a voltage -responding device, with a \ntypical signal range of 1.25 mV to 224 mV rms or – 58 dBV to \n−13 dBV . This is equivalen t to −45 dBm to 0 dBm, re 50 Ω.  For convenience, the signal is internally ac -coupled, using a \n5 pF capacitor to a load of 3 kΩ in shunt with 2 pF. This high -\npass coupling, with a corner at approximately 16 MHz, \ndetermin es the lowest operating frequency. Therefore, the \nsource can be dc grounded.  \nThe AD8314 provides two voltage outputs. The first, V_UP , \nincreases from close to ground to about 1.2 V as the input signal \nlevel increases from 1.25 mV to 224 mV . This output is intended for use in measurement mode. Consult the Applications  section \nfor information on this mode. A capacitor can be connected \nbetween the V_UP and FLTR pins when it is desirable to \nincrease the time interval over which averaging of the input \nwaveform occurs.  \nThe second output, V_DN, is an inversion of V_UP but with twice the slope and offset by a fixed amount. This output starts at about 2.25 V (provided the supply voltage is ≥3.3 V) for the minimum input and falls to a value close to ground at the \nmaximum input. This output is intended for analog control \nloop applications. A setpoint voltage is applied to VSET, and V_DN is then used to control a VGA or power amplifier. Here again, an external filter capacitor can be added to extend the  \naveraging time. Consult the Applications  section for \ninformation on this mode.  \nThe AD8314 is available in 8 -lead MSOP and 8 -lead LFCSP \npackages and consumes 4.5 mA from a 2.7 V to 5.5 V supply. \nWhen powered down, the typical sleep current is 20 µA.  \n \n \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM  \n10dB\nOFFSET\nCOMPENSATIONV-I\nI-V\nRFIN\nCOMM\n(PADDLE)VPOSX2\nENBLV_DNV_UPVSETFLTR\nAD831410dB 10dB 10dB\nBAND GAP\nREFERENCEDET DET+–\n–\n+DET DET DET\n01086-001 \nFigure 1. \n \nAD8314  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 10 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8314 is a logarithmic amplifier (log amp) similar in \ndesign to the A D8313; further details about the structure and \nfunction can be found in the AD8313 data sheet and other log \namps produced by ADI. Figure 28 shows the main features of \nthe AD8314 in block schematic form.  \nThe AD8314 combines two key functions needed for the measurement of signal level over a moderately wide dynamic \nrange. First, it p rovides the amplification needed to respond to \nsmall signals, in a chain of four amplifier/limiter cells, each \nhaving a small signal gain of 10 dB and a bandwidth of approximately 3.5 GHz. At the output of each of these amplifier stages is a full- wave rect ifier, essentially a square -law detector \ncell, that converts the RF signal voltages to a fluctuating current having an average value that increases with signal level. A \nfurther passive detector stage is added prior to the first stage. \nTherefore, there are five detectors, each separated by 10 dB, spanning some 50 dB of dynamic range. The overall accuracy at the extremes of this total range, viewed as the deviation from an ideal logarithmic response, that is, the law -conformance error, \ncan be judged by reference to Figure 7, which shows that errors \nacross the central 40 dB are moderate. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 8 \nthrough Figure 11, Figure 13, and Figure 14 show how the \nconformance to an ideal logarithmic function varies with \nsupply voltage, temperature, and frequency.  \nThe output of these detector cells is in the form of a differential current, making their summation a simple matter. It can easily be shown that such summation closely approximates a logarithmic  \nfunction. This result is then converted to a voltage, at Pin V_UP , through a high- gain stage. In measurement modes, this output \nis connected back to a voltage -to-current (V -I) stage, in such a \nmanner t hat V_UP is a logarithmic measure of the RF input \nvoltage, with a slope and intercept controlled by the design. For \na fixed termination resistance at the input of the AD8314, a \ngiven voltage corresponds to a certain power level.  However, in using this par t, it must be understood that log \namps do not fundamentally respond to power. It is for this reason the dBV is used (decibels above 1 V rms) rather than the commonly used metric of dBm. While the dBV scaling is fixed, independent of termination impedance, the corresponding power level is not. For example, 224 mV rms is always −13 dBV (with one further condition of an assumed sinusoidal waveform;  \nsee the Applications  section for more information on the effect \nof waveform on logarithmic intercept), and it corresponds to a power of 0 dBm when the net impedance at the input is 50 Ω. When this impedance is altered to 200 Ω, the same voltage clearly represents a power level that is four times smaller  \n(P = V\n2/R), that is, −6 dBm. Note that dBV can be converted to \ndBm for the special case of a 50 Ω  system by simply adding \n13 dB (0 dBV is equivalent to +13 dBm).  \nTherefore, the external termination added prior to the AD8314 \ndetermines the effective power scaling. This often takes the \nform of a simple resistor (52.3 Ω   provides a net 50 Ω  input), \nbut more elaborate matching networks can be used. This \nimpedance determines the logarithmic intercept, the input \npower fo r which the output would cross the baseline (V_UP = \nzero) if the function were continuous for all values of input. Because this is never the case for a practical log amp, the intercept refers to the value obtained by the minimum -error \nstraight -line fit to the actual graph of V_UP vs. PIN (more \ngenerally, V\nIN). Again, keep in mind that the quoted values \nassume a sinusoidal (CW) signal. Where there is complex modulation, as in CDMA, the calibration of the power response needs to be adjusted accordingly. Where a true power (waveform -\nindependent) response is needed, the use of an rms -responding \ndetector, such as the AD8361, should be considered.  \n \n10dB\nOFFSET\nCOMPENSATIONV-I\nI-V\nRFIN\nCOMM\n(PADDLE)VPOSX2\nENBLV_DNV_UPVSETFLTR\nAD831410dB 10dB 10dB\nBAND GAP\nREFERENCEDET DET+–\n–\n+DET DET DET\n01086-028 \nFigu re 28.

In practice, it usually falls off somewhat at higher frequencies, due to the declining gain of the amplifier stages and other effects in the detector cells. For the AD8314, the slope \nat low frequencies is nominally 21.3 mV/dB, falling almost \nlinearly with frequency to about 19.2 mV/dB at 2.5 GHz. These \nvalues are sensibly independent of temperature (see Figure 10) \nand almost totally unaffected by the supply voltage from 2.7 V to 5.5 V (se e Figure 11).  \nINVERTED OUTPUT \nThe second provision is the inclusion of an inverting amplifier to the output, for use in controller applications. Most power amplifiers require a gain -control bias that must decrease from a \nlarge positive value toward ground level as the power output is \nrequired to decrease. This control voltage, which appears at \nPin V_DN, is not only of the opposite polarity to V_UP , but also \nneeds to have an offset added to determine its most positive value \nwhen the power level (assumed to be monitored through a directional coupler at the output of the PA) is minimal.  \nThe starting value of V_DN is nominally 2.25 V , and it falls on a slope of twice that of V_UP; in other words,−43 mV/dB.  Figure 29 \nshows how this is achieved: the reference voltage that determines the maximum output is derived from the on -chip voltage \nreference and is substantially independent of the supply voltage \nor temperature. However, the full output cannot be attained for \nsupply voltages under 3.3 V; Figure  22 shows this dependency. \nThe relationship between V_UP and V_DN is shown in Figure 30.

C | Page 12 of 20 APPLICATIONS \nBASIC CONNECTIONS  \nFigure 31 shows connections for the basic measurement mode. \nA supply voltage of 2.7 V to 5.5 V is required. The supply to the \nVPOS pin should be decoupled with a low inductan ce 0.1 µF \nsurface -mount ceramic capacitor. A series resistor of about 10 Ω \ncan be added; this resistor slightly reduces the supply voltage to  the \nAD8314 (maximum current into the VPOS pin is approximately  \n9 mA when V_DN is delivering 5 mA). Its use should be \navoided in applications where the power supply voltage is very \nlow (that is, 2.7 V). A series inductor provides similar power supply filtering with minimal drop in supply voltage.  \nCF\nOPTIONAL\n(SEE TEXT)0.1µF\nOPTIONAL\n(SEE TEXT)VS\nVS VDN\nVUPINPUT 1\n2\n3\n4ENBLRFIN\nAD83148\n7\n6\n5VSET\nFLTRV_DNVPOS\nCOMMV_UP52.3Ω\n01086-031 \nFigure 31. Basic Connections for Operat ion in Measurement Mode  \nThe ENBL pin is here connected to VPOS. The AD8314 can be disabled by pulling this pin to ground when the chip current is \nreduced to about 20 µA from its normal value of 4.5 mA. The \nlogic threshold is around +V\nS/2 and the enable function occurs \nin about 1.5 µs. Note, however, further settling time is generally \nneeded at low input levels. \nThe AD8314 has an internal input coupling capacitor. This \neliminates the need for external ac couplin g. A broadband input \nmatch is achieved in this example by connecting a 52.3  Ω resistor \nbetween RFIN and ground. This resistance combines with the \ninternal input impedance of approximately 3 kΩ to give an overall broadband input resistance of 50 Ω. Several other coupling methods are possible, which are described in the  \n Input Coupling Options  section.  \nThe measurement mode is selected by connecting VSET to V_UP , which establishes a feedback path and sets the \nlogarithmic slope to its nominal value. The peak voltage range \nof the measurement extends from −58 dBV to −13 dBV at 0.9 GHz, and only slightly less at higher frequencies up to \n2.5 GHz. Therefore, using the 50 Ω termination, the equivalent \npower range is −45 dBm to 0 dBm. At a slope of 21.5 mV/dB, this would amount to an output span of 967 mV . Figure 32 \nshows the transfer function for V_UP at a supply voltage of 3 V and input frequency of 0.9 GHz.  \n \n V_DN, which is generally not used when the AD8314 is used in \nmeasurement mode, is essentially an inverted version of V_UP . The voltage on V_UP and V_DN are re lated by  \nV\nDN = 2.25 V − 2 V UP \nWhile V_DN can deliver up to 6 mA, the load resistance on V_UP should not be lower than 10 kΩ in order that the full -\nscale output of 1 V can be generated with the limited available current of 200 µA maximum.

V UP and Log Conformance Error vs.  \nInput Level vs. Input Level at 900 MHz  \nTRANSFER FUNCTION IN TERMS OF SLOPE AND \nINTERCEPT \nThe transfer function of the AD8314 is characterized in terms \nof its slope and intercept. The logarithmic slope is defined as the \nchange in the RSSI output voltage for a 1 d B change at the input. \nFor the AD8314, slope is nominally 21.5 mV/dB. Therefore, a 10 dB change at the input results in a change at the output of approximately 215 mV . Log conformance plot, Figure 32, shows \nthe range over which the device maintains its constant slope. The dynamic range can be defined as the range over which the \nerror remains within a certain band, usually ±1 dB or ±3 dB. In \nFigure 32 for example, the ±1 dB dynamic range is approximately  \n50 dB (from −13 dBV to −63 dBV).  \nData Sheet  AD8314  \n \nRev. C | Page 13 of 20 The intercept is the point at which the extrapolated linear \nrespons e would intersect the horizontal axis (see Figure 32). \nUsing the slope and intercept, the output voltage can be \ncalculated for any input level within the  specified input range by  \nVUP = VSLOPE × (PIN − PO) \nwhere:  \nVUP is the demodulated and filtered RSSI output.  \nVSLOPE is the logarithmic slope, expressed in V/dB.  \nPIN is the input signal, expressed in decibels relative to some \nreference level (either dBm or d BV in this case).  \nPO is the logarithmic intercept, expressed in decibels relative to \nthe same reference level.  \nFor example, at an input level of −40 dBV (−27 dBm), the \noutput voltage is  \nVOUT = 0.020 V/dB × [−40 dBV − (−63 dBV)] = 0.46 V  \ndBV VS. dBm \nThe most widely used convention in RF systems is to specify \npower in dBm, that is, decibels above 1 mW in 50 Ω. Specification  \nof log amp input levels in terms of power is strictly a concession \nto popular convention; they do not respond to power (tacitly power absorbed at the input), but to the input voltage. The use \nof dBV , defined as decibels with respect to a 1  V rms sine wave, \nis more precise, although this is still not unambiguous because waveform is also involved in the response of a log amp, which, \nfor a complex input (such as a CDMA signal), does not follow \nthe rms value exactly. Since most users specify RF signals in \nterms of power (more specifically, in dBm/50 Ω), both dBV and \ndBm are used in specifying the performance of the AD8314 \nshowing equivale nt dBm levels for the special case of a \n50 Ω environment. Values in dBV are converted to  \ndBm re 50 Ω  by adding 13.  \nFILTER CAPACITOR  \nThe video bandwidth of both V_UP and V_DN is approximately 3.5 MHz. In CW applications where the input frequency is much h igher than this, no further filtering of the \ndemodulated signal is required. Where there is a low frequency modulation of the carrier amplitude, however, the low -pass \ncorner must be reduced by the addition of an external filter \ncapacitor, C\nF (see Figure 31). The video bandwidth is related  \nto C F by \n()FCBandwidth Video+××=pF5.3 kΩ13π21 \n \n \n \n OPERATING IN CONTROL LER MODE  \nFigure 33 shows the basic connections for operation in the \ncontroller mode, and Figure 34 shows a block diagram of a \ntypical controller mode application. The feedback from V_UP \nto VSET is broken and the desired setpoint voltage is applied to VSET from the controlling source (often this is a DAC). V\nDN \nrails high (2.2 V on a 3.3 V supply, and 1.9 V on a 2.7 V supply) \nwhen the applied power is less than the value corresponding to \nthe setpoint voltage. When the input power slightly exceeds this value, V\nDN would, in the absence of the loop via the power \namplifier gain pin, decrease rapidly toward gr ound. In the \nclosed loop, however, the reduction in V DN causes the power \namplifier to reduce its output. This restores a balance between \nthe actual power level sensed at the input of the AD8314 and \nthe demanded value determined by the setpoint. This assume s \nthat the gain control sense of the variable gain element is positive, that is, an increasing voltage from V_DN tends to increase gain. The output swing and current sourcing capability of V_DN are shown in Figure 22 and Figure 25. \n0.1µF\nVS\nVS VDNINPUT\nVSET1\n2\n3\n4ENBLRFIN\nAD83148\n7\n6\n5VSET\nFLTRV_DNVPOS\nCOMMV_UP52.3Ω\nCF\n01086-033 \nFigure 33.

Typical Controller Mode Application  \nThe relationship between the input level and the setpoint voltage follows from the nominal transfer function of the device (V\nUP vs. input amplitude, see Figure 4). For example, a voltage of \n1 V on VSET demands a power level of 0 dBm at RFIN. The corresponding power level at the output of the power amplifier is greate r than this amount due to the attenuation through the \ndirectional coupler.  \n \n \nAD8314 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 14 of 20 When connected in a PA control loop, as shown in Figure 34, \nthe voltage V UP is not explicitly used but is implicated in again \nsetting up the required averaging time, by choice of C F. \nHowever, now the effective loop response time is a much more \ncomplicated function of the PA ’s gain-control characteristics, \nwhich are very nonlinear. A complete solution requires specific \nknowledge of the power amplifier. \nThe transient response of this control loop is determined by the \nfilter capacitor, C F. When this is large, the loop is unconditionally \nstable (by virtue of the dominant pole generated by this capacitor), but the response is sluggish. The minimum value \nensuring stability should be used, requiring full attention to the \nparticulars of the power amplifier control function. Because this is invariably nonlinear, the choice must be made for the worst-case condition, which usually corresponds to the smallest output from the PA, where the gain function is steepest. In practice, an improvement in loop dynamics can often be \nachieved by adding a response zero, formed by a resistor in \nseries with C\nF. \nPOWER-ON AND ENABLE GLITCH \nAs previously mentioned, the AD8314 can be put into a low \npower mode by pulling the ENBL pin to ground. This reduces \nthe quiescent current from 4.5 mA to 20 μA. Alternatively, the supply can be turned off to eliminate the quiescent current. Figure 16 and Figure 26 show the behavior of the V_DN output \nunder these two conditions (in Figure 26, ENBL is tied to \nVPOS). The glitch that results in both cases can be reduced by \nloading the V_DN output.  \nINPUT COUPLING OPTIONS \nThe internal 5 pF coupling capacitor of the AD8314, along with \nthe low frequency input impedance of 3 kΩ, gives a high-pass \ninput corner frequency of approximately 16 MHz. This sets the minimum operating frequency. Figure 35 through Figure 37 \nshow three options for input coupling. A broadband resistive \nmatch can be implemented by connecting a shunt resistor to ground at RFIN (see Figure 35). This 52.3 Ω resistor (other values can also be used to select different overall input impedances) combines with the input impedance of the \nAD8314 (3 kΩ||2 pF) to give a broadband input impedance of \n50 Ω. While the input resistance and capacitance (CIN and RIN) varies by approximately ±20% from device to device, the dominance of the external shunt resistor means that the variation in the overall input impedance is close to the tolerance of the \nexternal resistor.  \nAt frequencies above 2 GHz, the input impedance drops below \n250 Ω (see Figure 12), so it is appropriate to use a larger value \nshunt resistor. This value is calculated by plotting the input \nimpedance (resistance and capacitance) on a Smith Chart and choosing the best value shunt resistor to bring the input impedance closest to the center of the chart. At 2.5 GHz, a \nshunt resistor of 165 Ω is recommended. A reactive match can also be implemented as shown in Figure 36. \nThis is not recommended at low frequencies as device tolerances dramatically varies the quality of the match because of the large input resistance. For low frequencies, Figure 35 or Figure 37 is recommended. \nIn Figure 36, the matching components are drawn as general \nreactances. Depending on the frequency, the input impedance at \nthat frequency, and the availability of standard value components, either a capacitor or an inductor is used. As in the previous case, the input impedance at a particular frequency is plotted on a Smith Chart and matching components are chosen (shunt or \nSeries L, shunt or Series C) to move the impedance to the center \nof the chart. Table 5 gives standard component values for some popular frequencies. Matching components for other frequencies can be calculated using the input resistance and reactance data over frequency, which is given in Figure 12. Note that the reactance is plotted as though it appears in parallel with the \ninput impedance (which it does because the reactance is \nprimarily due to input capacitance). \nThe impedance matching characteristics of a reactive matching \nnetwork provide voltage gain ahead of the AD8314; this increases \nthe device sensitivity (see Table 5). The voltage gain is calculated by \n12log2010RRGain VoltagedB\uf03d  \nwhere R2 is the input impedance of the AD8314, and R1 is the \nsource impedance to which the AD8314 is being matched. Note \nthat this gain is only achieved for a perfect match. Component \ntolerances and the use of standard values tend to reduce gain. \n50Ω SOURCE\nRSHUNT\n52.3Ω50Ω\nCINRINCCAD8314RFIN\nVBIAS\n01086-035 \nFigure 35.

A series resistor, connected to the RF source, combines with the input impedance of the AD8314 to resistively divide the input signal being applied to the input. This has the advantage of very little power being t apped off in RF power transmission applications.  \nTable 5.

Increasing the Output Slope EFFECT OF WAVEFORM T YPE ON INTERCEPT  \nAlthough specified for input levels in dBm (dB relative to  \n1 mW), the AD8314 fundamentally responds to voltage and not \nto power. A direct consequence of this characteristic is that input signals of equal rms power but differing crest factors produces different results at the log amp’s output.  \nThe effect of differing signal w aveforms is to shift the effective \nvalue of the intercept upwards or downwards. Graphically, this looks like a vertical shift in the log amp’s transfer function. The logarithmic slope, however, is not affected. For example, \nconsider the case of the AD8314 being alternately fed by an \nunmodulated sine wave and by a single CDMA channel of the same rms power. The AD8314’s output voltage differs by the equivalent of 3.55 dB (70 mV) over the complete dynamic range of the device (the output for a CDMA input being lower).  \nTable 6 shows the correction factors that should be applied to \nmeasure the rms signal strength of various signal types. A sine \nwave input is use d as a reference. To measure the rms power of \na square wave, for example, the mV equivalent of the dB value \ngiven in the table (20 mV/dB times 3.01 dB) should be subtracted from the output voltage of the AD8314.  \nTable 6.

Be cause the PF08107B transmits a \nmaximum power level of 35 dBm, additional attenuation of 15 dB is required before the coupled signal is applied to  \nthe AD8314.  \nVS\n2.7V\nVSET\n0V TO 1.1VPF08107B\n(HITACHI)PIN BAND 1\n3dBm\nPIN BAND 2\n3dBm1000pF\n0dBm\nMAXATTN\n15dB\nCF\n220pFPOUT BAND 2\n32dBm MAXPOUT BAND 1\n35dBm MAX TO\nANTENNA7\n8\n51\n4\n3\n2 6LDC15D190A0007ABAND\nSELECT\n0V/2V3.5V\nVCTL\nVAPC\n52.3Ω49.9Ω\nVS1\n2\n3\n4ENBLRFIN\nAD83148\n7\n6\n5VSET\nFLTRV_DNVPOS\nCOMMV_UP0.1µF4.7µF\n01086-039 \nFigure 39. A Dual Mode Power Amplifier Control Circuit  \n The setpoint voltage, in the 0 V to 1.1 V range, is applied to the \nVSET pin of the AD8314. This is typically supplied by a DAC. \nThis voltage is compared to the input level of the AD8314. Any imbalance between VSET and the RF in put level is corrected by \nV_DN, which drives the V\nAPC (gain control) of the power \namplifier. V_DN reaches a maximum value of approximately 1.9 V on a 2.7 V supply (this is higher for higher supply \nvoltages) while delivering approximately 3 mA to the V\nAPC input.  \nA filter capacitor (C F) must be used to stabilize the loop. The \nchoice of C F depends to a large degree on the gain control \ndynamics of the power amplifier, something that is frequently \ncharacterized poorly, so some trial and error can be necessary. In this example, a 220 pF capacitor gives the loop sufficient speed to follow the GSM and DCS1800 time slot ramping \nprofiles, while still having a stable, critically damped response.  \nData Sheet  AD8314  \n \nRev. C | Page 17 of 20 Figure 40 shows the relationship between the setpoint voltage, \nVSET and output power at 0.9 GHz. The overall gain control \nfunction is linear in dB for a dynamic range of over 40 dB.  \nFigu re 41 shows a similar circuit for a single band handset \npower amplifier. The BGY241 (Phillips) is driven by a nominal \npower level of 0 dBm. A 20 dB directional coupler, DC09 -73 \n(Alpha), is u sed to couple the signal in this case. Figure 42 \nshows the relationship between the control voltage and the output power at 0.9 GHz.  \nIn both of these examples, noise on the V_DN pin can be reduced  \nby placing a simple RC low -pass filter between V\nDN and the gain \ncontrol pin of the power amplifier. However, the value of the resistor should be kept low to minimize the voltage drop across \nit due to the dc cu rrent flowing into the gain control input.  \n40\n–30\n0 1.2\nVSET (V)POUT (dBm)30\n20\n10\n0\n–10\n–20\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n01086-040 \nFigure 40.

C | Page 18 of 20 OPERATION AT 2.7 GHz  \nWhile the AD8314 is specified to operate at frequencies up to \n2.5 GHz, it works at higher frequencies, although it does exhibit \nslightly higher output volt age temperature drift. Figure 43 \nshows the transfer function of a typical device at 2.7 GHz, at \nambient as well as hot and cold temperatures.  \nFigure 44 shows the transfer function of the AD8314 when \ndriven by both an unmodulated sine wave and a 64 QAM signal. As previously discussed, the higher peak -to-average ratio \nof the 64 QAM signal causes an increase in the intercept.  \nIn this case, the intercept increases by approximately 1.5 dB, causing the overall transfer function to drop by the same \namount. For precision operation, the AD8314 should be \ncalibrat ed for each signal type that is driving it.  \n USING THE LFCSP PACKAGE  \nOn the underside of the LFCSP package, there is an exposed, \ncompressed paddle. This paddle is internally connected to the \nchip’s ground. While the paddle can be connected to the printed \ncircuit board’s ground plane, there is no thermal or electrical requirement to do this.  \nEVALUATION BOARD  \nFigure 45 shows the schematic of the AD8314 \uf0ec MSOP \nevaluation board. The layout and silkscreen of the component side are shown in Figure 46 and Figure 47. An evaluation board \nis also available for the LFCSP package. (For exact part numbers, \nsee the Ordering Guide .) Apart from the slightly smaller device \nfootprint, the LFCSP evaluation board is identical to the MSOP board. The board is powered by a si ngle supply in the 2.7 V to \n5.5 V range. The power supply is decoupled by a single 0.1 µF capacitor. Additional decoupling, in the form of a series resistor \nor inductor in R9, can also be added.
