The A port \nis designed to track V CCA. VCCA accepts any supply \nvoltage from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The B port is designed \nto track V CCB. VCCB accepts any supply voltage from \n1.65 V to 5.5 V. This allows for universal low-voltage \nbidirectional translation between any of the 1.8-V, 2.5-\nV, 3.3-V, and 5-V voltage nodes.\nThe SN74LVC1T45 is designed for asynchronous \ncommunication between two data buses. The logic \nlevels of the direction-control (DIR) input activate \neither the B-port outputs or the A-port outputs. The \ndevice transmits data from the A bus to the B bus \nwhen the B-port outputs are activated and from the \nB bus to the A bus when the A-port outputs are \nactivated. The input circuitry is always active on both \nA and B ports and must have a logic HIGH or LOW \nlevel applied to prevent excess I CC and I CCZ.\nThe SN74LVC1T45 is designed so that the DIR input \nis powered by V CCA. This device is fully specified \nfor partial-power-down applications using I off. The I off \ncircuitry disables the outputs, preventing damaging \ncurrent backflow through the device when it is \npowered down. The V CC isolation feature is designed \nso that if either V CC input is at GND, then both ports \nare in the high-impedance state.\nNanoFree package technology is a major \nbreakthrough in IC packaging concepts, using the die \nas the package.\nPackage Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN74LVC1T45DRL (SOT, 6) 1.60 mm × 1.20 mm\nDBV (SOT-23, 6) 2.90 mm × 1.60 mm\nDCK (SC70, 6) 2.00 mm × 1.25 mm\nDPK (USON, 6) 1.60 mm × 1.60 mm\nYZP (DSBGA, 6) 1.39 mm × 0.90 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.SN74LVC1T45\nSCES515M  – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Pin A and the direction \ncontrol pin (DIR) are supported by V CCA and pin B is supported by V CCB. The A port is able to accept I/O \nvoltages ranging from 1.65 V to 5.5 V, while the B port can accept I/O voltages from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The high on \nthe DIR allows data transmissions from A to B and a low on the DIR allows data transmissions from B to A.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nBDIR5\n4A3\nVCCA VCCB\nFigure 8-1. Logic Diagram (Positive Logic)\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Fully Configurable Dual-Rail Design Allows Each Port to Operate Over the Full 1.65-V to 5.5-V \nPower-Supply Range\nBoth V CCA and V CCB can be supplied at any voltage between 1.65 V and 5.5 V, making the device suitable for \ntranslating between any of the voltage nodes (1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, and 5-V).\n8.3.2 Support High Speed Translation\nThe SN74LVC1T45 device supports high data rate applications. The translated signal data rate can be up to 420 \nMbps when the signal is translated from 3.3 V to 5 V.\n8.3.3 Ioff Supports Partial Power-Down Mode Operation\nThe inputs and outputs for this device enter a high-impedance state when the device is powered down, inhibiting \ncurrent backflow into the device. The maximum leakage into or out of any input or output pin on the device is \nspecified by I off in the Electrical Charateristics .\n8.3.4 Balanced High-Drive CMOS Push-Pull Outputs\nA balanced output allows the device to sink and source similar currents. The high drive capability of this device \ncreates fast edges into light loads so impedance matching and load conditions should be considered to prevent \nringing. Additionally, the outputs of this device are capable of driving larger currents than the device can sustain \nwithout being damaged. Two outputs can be connected together for a stronger output drive strength. The \nelectrical and thermal limits defined in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  must be followed at all times.\n8.3.5 Vcc Isolation\nThe I/O\'s of both ports will enter a high-impedance state when either of the supplies are at GND, while the other \nsupply is still connected to the device. The maximum leakage into or out of any input or output pin on the device \nis specified by I off in the Electrical Characteristics .SN74LVC1T45\nSCES515M – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC1T45\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nTable 8-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74LVC1T45 device can be used in level-translation applications for interfacing devices or systems \noperating at different interface voltages with one another. The maximum data rate can be up to 420 Mbps when \ndevice translates signals from 3.3 V to 5 V.\n9.2 Typical Application\n9.2.1 Unidirectional Logic Level-Shifting Application\nFigure 9-1  shows an example of the SN74LVC1T45 being used in a unidirectional logic level-shifting application.\n1\n2\n36\n5\n4VCC1 VCC1 VCC2 VCC2\nSYSTEM-1 SYSTEM-2\nFigure 9-1.

For a valid logic high the value must exceed the V IH of the input port. For a valid logic low the value must \nbe less than the V IL of the input port.\n• Output voltage range\n- Use the supply voltage of the device that the SN74LVC1T45 device is driving to determine the output voltage \nrange. \u2003SN74LVC1T45\nSCES515M – DECEMBER 2003 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC1T45\n9.2.1.3 Application Curve\nFigure 9-2.

Because the \nSN74LVC1T45 does not have an output-enable ( OE) pin, the system designer should take precautions to avoid \nbus contention between SYSTEM-1 and SYSTEM-2 when changing directions.\n1\n2\n36\n5\n4VCC1 VCC1 VCC2\nSYSTEM-1 SYSTEM-2DIR CTRLI/O-1VCC2\nI/O-2Pullup/Down\nor Bus Hold(1)Pullup/Down\nor Bus Hold(1)\nFigure 9-3.

For example, if the SN74LVC1T45 initially is transmitting from A to B, then \nthe DIR bit is switched; the B port of the device must be disabled before presenting it with an input. After the \nB port has been disabled, an input signal applied to it appears on the corresponding A port after the specified \npropagation delay.\n9.2.2.3 Application Curve\nFigure 9-4.

VCCA accepts \nany supply voltage from 1.65 V to 5.5 V and V CCB accepts any supply voltage from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The A port \nand B port are designed to track V CCA and V CCB, respectively allowing for low-voltage bidirectional translation \nbetween any of the 1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V and 5-V voltage nodes. The recommendation is to first power-up the input \nsupply rail to help avoid internal floating while the output supply rail ramps up. However, both power-supply rails \ncan be ramped up simultaneously.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo ensure reliability of the device, the following common printed-circuit board layout guidelines are \nrecommended:\n•Bypass capacitors should be used on power supplies.\n•Short trace lengths should be used to avoid excessive loading.\n•Placing pads on the signal paths for loading capacitors or pullup resistors to help adjust rise and fall times of \nsignals depends on the system requirements\n11.2 Layout Example\nFigure 11-1.

#### Description:
The **SN74LVC1T45** is a single-bit, dual-supply, non-inverting bus transceiver designed for voltage level translation between different logic levels. It features two separate configurable power-supply rails (VCCA and VCCB), allowing it to interface between devices operating at various voltage levels ranging from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The device is capable of bidirectional data transmission, controlled by a direction input (DIR), which determines the active data path.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Level Translation:** The SN74LVC1T45 is primarily used in applications requiring logic level shifting between devices operating at different voltage levels, such as interfacing 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V, and 5 V systems.
- **Communication Interfaces:** It is suitable for asynchronous communication between two data buses, making it ideal for personal electronics, industrial applications, enterprise systems, and telecommunications.
- **Power Management:** The device's low power consumption and partial power-down capabilities make it suitable for battery-operated devices and energy-efficient designs.

This component is particularly useful in mixed-voltage environments where devices with different operating voltages need to communicate without damaging each other.
