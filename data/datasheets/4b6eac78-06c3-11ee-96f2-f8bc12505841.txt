The ra ted dissipation applie s only if the permitt ed \nfilm temperature is not exceeded.These resistors do not feature a limited lifetime when operated  within the permissibl e limits.

A cermet film  \nlayer and a glass-over are depo sited on both sides of a high  \ngrade (Al 2O3) ceramic substrate with its prepared inner  \ncontacts on both sides. A sp ecial laser is used to achieve  \nthe target value by smoothly fine  trimming the resistive layer  \nwithout damaging  the ceramics . The resistor elements are  \ncovered by a protective coatin g designed for electrical,  \nmechanical and climatic protection. The terminations  \nreceive a final pure ti n on nickel plating.\nThe result of the determined production is verified by an  \nextensive testing procedure on 100 % of the individual chip  \nresistors. Only accepted product s are laid directly into the  \ntape in accordance with IEC 60286-3 Type 1a and  \nType 2a (1).\nASSEMBLY\nThe resistors are suitable for processing on automatic SMD  \nassembly systems. They are suitable for automatic  \nsoldering wave, reflow or vapor phase as shown in  \nIEC 61760-1 (1). The encapsulation is resistant to all  \ncleaning solvents commonly used in the electronics  \nindustry, including alcohols, esters and aqueous solutions.  \nThe suitability of conformal coatings, potting compounds  \nand their processes, if app lied, shall be qualified by  \nappropriate means to ensure th e long-term stability of the  \nwhole system.The resistors are RoHS-compl iant, the pure tin plating  \nprovides compatibility with  lead (Pb)-free and  \nlead-containing soldering processes. Solderability is  \nspecified for 2 years after produ ction or requalification. The  \npermitted storage time is 20 years. The immunity of the  \nplating against tin whisker gr owth has been proven under  \nextensive testing.\nMATERIALS\nVishay acknowledges the following systems for the  \nregulation of hazardous substances:• IEC 62474, Material Declaration for Products of and for the  \nElectrotechnical Industry, with the list of declarable  \nsubstances given therein \n(2)\n• The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List  \n(GADSL) (3)\n• The REACH regulation (1907/2006/EC) and the related list  \nof substances with very high concern (SVHC) (4) for its  \nsupply chainThe products do not contain any of the banned  \nsubstances as per IEC 62474, GADSL, or the SVHC list,  \nsee www.vishay.com/how/leadfree .\nHence the products fully comply with the following  \ndirectives:• 2000/53/EC End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (ELV) and  \nAnnex II (ELV II)\n• 2011/65/EU Restriction of the Use of Hazardous  \nSubstances Directive (RoHS) with amendment  \n2015/863/EU\n• 2012/19/EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment  \nDirective (WEEE)\nVishay pursues the elimination of conflict minerals from its  \nsupply chain, see the Conflict Minerals Policy at  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?49037\n.\nAPPROVALS\nThe resistors are qualified according to AEC-Q200.  \nWhere applicable, the resistors are tested in accordance  \nwith EN 140401-802  which refers to EN 60115-1 , \nEN 60115-8  and the variety of environmental test  \nprocedures of the IEC 60068 (1) series.\nRELATED PRODUCTS\nFor more information about pro ducts with superior surge  \nand pulse performance plea se refer to datasheet:  \nD/CRCW-IF e3, Pulse Proof Thick Film Chip Resistors  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?20024 .\nFor thick film resistors with standard requirements for power  \nrating, please refe r to datasheet:  \nD/CRCW e3, Standard Thick Film Chip  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?20035 .\nFor anti-surge products and high  power rating, please refer  \nto datasheet:  \nRCS e3, Anti-Surge High Power Thick Film Chip Resistors  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?20065 .\nNotes\n(1)The quoted IEC standards are also released as EN standards with the same number and identical contents\n(2)The IEC 62474 list of declarable subs tances is maintained in  a dedicated database, which is available at http://std.iec.ch/iec62474\n(3)The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL) is maintained by the American Chemistry Council and available at www.gadsl.org\n(4)The SVHC list is maintained by the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) and available at http://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table\nCRCW-HP e3\nwww.vishay.comVishay Draloric  \n \nRevision: 08-Sep-2021 5 Document Number: 20043\nFor technical questions, contact: thickfilmchip@vishay.com\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
