It uses \na phase lockable controlled on-time constant frequency, cur -\nrent mode architecture. PolyPhase operation allows multiple \nLTC7150 S regulators to run out-of-phase, which reduces \nthe amount of input and output capacitors required. The \noperating supply voltage range is from 3.1V to 20V.  \nThe operating frequency is programmable from 400kHz  to \n3MHz  with an external resistor . The high frequency capability \nallows the use of physically smaller inductor and capaci -\ntor sizes. For switching noise sensitive applications, the \nLTC7150 S can be externally synchronized from 400kHz  \nto 3MHz . The PHMODE pin allows the user control of the \nphase of the outgoing clock signal. The unique constant \nfrequency/controlled on-time architecture is ideal for high \nstep-down ratio applications that operate at high frequencies \nwhile demanding fast transient response. The LTC7150 S \nuses second generation Silent Switcher technology includ -\ning integrated bypass capacitors to deliver a highly efficient \nsolution at high frequencies with excellent EMI performance.  \nPART NUMBER TJMAX\nLTC7150 S 125°C\nLTC7150 S-4 150°C\n12V IN to 1.2V OUT ApplicationAPPLICATIONS nAEC- Q100  Qualified for Automotive Applications\n nSilent Switcher®2 Architecture for Low EMI\n nVIN Range : 3.1V to 20V\n nVOUT Range : 0.6V to 5.5V\n nDifferential V OUT Remote Sense\n nAdjustable Frequency : 400kHz  to 3MHz\n nPolyPhase® Operation : Up to 12 Phases\n nOutput T racking and Soft-Start\n nReference Accuracy : 0.6V ±1% Over Temperature\n nCurrent Mode Operation for Excellent Line and Load \nT ransient Response\n nAccurate 1.2V Run Pin Threshold\n nSupports Forced Continuous/Discontinuous Modes\n n42-Lead 6mm  × 5mm  × 1.3mm  BGA Package\n nServer Power Applications\n nDistributed Power Systems\n nPoint of Load Supply for ASIC, FPGA, DSP , µP , etc.\nAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. \nEfficiency and Power Loss\nSV\nIN\n = 5V\nI\nOUT\n (A)\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nEFFICIENCY (%)\nPOWER LOSS (W)\n7150S TA01b\n7150S TA01aRUN\nPVIN\nSVINSW\nFB\nPHMODE\nTRACK/SS\nCLKOUT\nINTV CCVOUT–\nPGOOD\nMODE/SYNC\nSGNDL TC7150S 22µF\n×2VIN\n3.1V TO 20V0.25µH\nRT ITH4.7µF\n162k 10k\n1nF 22pF10k\n10k100µF\n×2330µFVOUT\n1.2V/20A\n+\nLTC7150 S/LTC7150 S-4\n2\nRev.

The LTC7150 SE is guaranteed to meet specifications from \n0°C to 125°C junction temperature. Specifications over the –40°C to \n125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, \ncharacterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The \nLTC7150 SI is guaranteed over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction  \ntemperature range. The LTC7150 SJ-4 is guaranteed over the –40°C to \n150°C operating junction temperature range. Note that the maximum \nambient temperature consistent with these specifications is determined by specific operating conditions in conjunction with board layout, the rated \npackage thermal impedance and other environmental factors. The junction \ntemperature  \n(TJ, in °C) is calculated from the ambient temperature (T A, in °C) and \npower dissipation (P D, in Watts) according to the formula :\n TJ = TA + (P D • θJA), \nwhere θJA (in °C/W) is the package thermal impedance.\nNote 3 : The quiescent current in forced continuous mode does not include \nswitching loss of the power FETs.\nNote 4 : The LTC7150 S is tested in a feedback loop that servos V ITH to a \nspecified voltage and measures the resultant V FB.\nNote 5 : There is additional switch current due to internal resistor to ground.\nLTC7150 S/LTC7150 S-4\n5\nRev.

B For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nMain Control Loop\nThe LTC7150 S is a current mode monolithic 20A step-\ndown regulator . In normal operation, the internal top power \nMOSFET is turned on for a fixed interval determined by a \none-shot timer , OST . When the top power MOSFET turns \noff, the bottom power MOSFET turns on until the current \ncomparator , I CMP, trips, restarting the one-shot timer and \ninitiating the next cycle. Inductor current is determined \nby sensing the voltage drop across the bottom power \nMOSFET when it is on. The voltage on the ITH pin sets \nthe comparator threshold corresponding to the inductor \nvalley current. The error amplifier , EA, adjusts this ITH \nvoltage by comparing the feedback signal, V FB, with an \ninternal 0.6V reference. If the load current increases, it \ncauses a drop in the feedback voltage relative to the inter -\nnal reference, the ITH voltage then rises until the average \ninductor current matches that of the load current.\nAt low load currents, the inductor current can drop to zero \nand become negative. In discontinuous mode (DCM), this \nis detected by the current reversal comparator , I REV, which \nthen shuts off the bottom power MOSFET . Both power \nMOSFETs will remain off with the output capacitor supply -\ning the load current until the I TH voltage rises above zero \ncurrent level to initiate the next cycle. If continuous mode \nof operation is desired, simply float the MODE/SYNC pin \nor tie it to INTV CC.\nThe operating frequency is determined by the value of the \nRT resistor , which programs the current for the internal \noscillator . An internal phase-lock loop servos the oscilla -\ntor frequency to an external clock signal if one is pres -\nent on the MODE/SYNC pin. Another internal phase-lock \nloop servos the switching regulator on-time to track the \ninternal oscillator to force a constant switching frequency.\nOvervoltage and undervoltage comparators OV and UV \npull the PGOOD output low if the output feedback volt-\nage, V FB, exits a ±8% window around the regulation point. \nContinuous operation is forced during OV and UV condi -\ntions except during start-up when the TRACK pin is ramp -\ning up to 0.6V.  The “S” in LTC7150 S refers to the second generation \nSilent Switcher technology. The IC has integrated ceramic \ncapacitors for V IN and BOOST to keep all the fast AC cur -\nrent loops small, thus improving the EMI performance.  \nFurthermore, it allows for faster switching edges which \ngreatly improves efficiency at high switching frequencies.\nRUN Threshold\nPulling the RUN pin to ground forces the LTC7150 S into \nits shutdown state. Bringing the RUN pin to above 0.6V \nwill turn on the internal reference only, while keeping the \npower MOSFETs off. Further increasing the RUN voltage \nabove the RUN rising threshold (nominally 1.2V) turns on \nthe entire chip. The accurate 1.2V RUN threshold allows \nthe user to program the SV IN under voltage lockout \nthreshold by placing a resistor divider from SV IN.\nINTV CC Regulator\nAn internal low dropout (LDO) regulator produces the 3.3V \nsupply that powers the drivers and internal bias circuitry. \nThe INTV CC must be bypassed to ground with a minimum \nof a 4.7µF  ceramic capacitor . Good bypassing is neces -\nsary to supply the high transient currents required by the \npower MOSFET gate drivers. Applications with high input \nvoltage and high switching frequency will experience an \nincrease in die temperature due to the higher power dis -\nsipation across the LDO. In such cases, if there ’s another \n5V or 3.3V supply rail available, consider using that to \ndrive the SV IN pin to lower the power dissipation across \nthe internal LDO.\nVIN Overvoltage Protection\nIn order to protect the internal power MOSFET devices \nagainst transient voltage spikes, the LTC7150 S constantly \nmonitors the PV IN pin for an overvoltage condition. When \nthe PV IN rises above 24.5V , the regulator suspends opera -\ntion by shutting off both power MOSFETs. Once PV IN drops \nbelow 21.5V , the regulator immediately resumes normal \noperation. During an overvoltage event, the internal soft-\nstart voltage is clamped to a voltage slightly higher than \nthe feedback voltage, thus the soft-start feature will be \npresent upon exiting an overvoltage condition.\nLTC7150 S/LTC7150 S-4\n11\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe output voltage is set by an external resistive divider \naccording to the following equation :\n VOUT=0.6V•1+R1\nR2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nThe resistive divider allows the V FB pin to sense a frac -\ntion of the output voltage as shown in Figure\xa01 . Since the \nLTC7150 S will often be used in high power applications, \nthere can be significant voltage drop due to board layout \nbetween the part and the point of load (POL). Thus, it is \nimperative to have R2 and R1 Kelvin directly to the positive \nand negative terminals of the point of load. The negative \nterminal should then be connected directly to the V OUT– \npin of the LTC7150 S for differential V OUT sensing. A feed \nforward compensation capacitor , C FF, can also be placed \nbetween V OUT and FB to improve transient performance.\nIn applications where the POL is far from the IC, it is a \ngood idea to place a 0.1µF  capacitor from V OUT– to GND \nclose to the IC to filter any noise that might be injected \nonto the V OUT– trace. of the RT programmed frequency. See plot of switch -\ning frequency vs R T value in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics \xa0section. \nOutput Voltage T racking and Soft-Start\nThe LTC7150 S allows the user to program its output volt -\nage ramp rate by means of the TRACK/SS pin. An internal \n6µA current pulls up the TRACK/SS pin to INTV CC. Putting \nan external capacitor on TRACK/SS enables soft starting \nthe output to prevent current surge on the input sup -\nply. For output tracking applications, TRACK/SS can be \nexternally driven by another voltage source. From 0V to \n0.6V, the TRACK/SS voltage will override the internal 0.6V \nreference input to the error amplifier , thus regulating the \nfeedback voltage to that of the TRACK/SS pin. During this \nstart-up time, the LTC7150 S will operate in discontinuous \nmode.  When TRACK/SS is above 0.6V, tracking is dis -\nabled and the feedback voltage will regulate to the internal \nreference voltage. The relationship between output rise \ntime and TRACK/SS capacitance is given by :\n T SS = 120000 • CTRACK/SS\nA default internal soft-start ramp forces a minimum soft-\nstart time of 100µs by overriding the TRACK/SS pin input \nduring this time period. Hence, capacitance values less \nthan approximately 820pF  will not significantly affect soft-\nstart behavior .\nMultiphase Operation\nFor output loads that demand more than 20A of current, \nmultiple LTC7150 Ss can be paralleled to run out-of-phase \nto provide more output current. The MODE/SYNC pin allows \nthe LTC7150 S to synchronize to an external clock and the \ninternal phase-locked-loop allows the LTC7150 S to lock \nonto MODE/SYNC ’s phase as well. The CLKOUT signal \ncan be connected to the MODE/SYNC pin of the following \nLTC7150 S to line up both the frequency and the phase of \nthe entire system. Tying the PHMODE pin to INTV CC, SGND \nor floating the pin generates a phase difference between the \nclock applied on the MODE/SYNC pin and CLKOUT of 180° \ndegrees, 120° degrees, or 90° degrees respectively, which \ncorresponds to 2-phase, 3-phase, or 4-phase operation. A \ntotal of 12 phases can be paralleled to run simultaneously \nout-of-phase with respect to each other by programming the \nPHMODE pin of each LTC7150 S to different voltage levels.Figure\xa01.

External Compensation Network7150S F02RITH\nCITHITH\nCITHP\nTable 1 provides a basic guideline for the compensa -\ntion values that should be used given the frequency of \nthe part.

This time is generally \nabout 50ns . The minimum off-time limit imposes a maxi -\nmum duty cycle of t ON/(tON + tOFF(MIN) ). If the maximum \nduty cycle is reached, due to a dropping input voltage for \nexample, then the output will drop out of regulation. The \nminimum input voltage to avoid dropout is :\n  VIN(MIN)=VOUT•tON+tOFF(MIN)\ntONConversely, the minimum on-time is the smallest dura -\ntion of time in which the top power MOSFET can be in \nits “on” state. This time is typically 20ns . In continuous \nmode operation, the minimum on-time limit imposes a \nminimum duty cycle of\n DC MIN = f • tON(MIN)\nWhere t ON(MIN)  is the minimum on-time. Reducing the \noperating frequency will alleviate the minimum duty cycle \nconstraint.\nIn the rare cases where the minimum duty cycle is sur-\npassed, the output voltage will still remain in regulation, \nand the switching frequency will decrease from its pro -\ngrammed value. This is an acceptable result in many \napplications, so this constraint may not be of critical \nimportance in most cases. High switching frequencies \nmay be used in the design without any fear of output \novervoltage. As the sections on inductors and capacitor \nselection show, high switching frequencies allow the use \nof smaller board components, thus reducing the size of \nthe application circuit.\nInput Capacitor (C IN) Selection\nThe input capacitance, C IN, is needed to filter the square \nwave current at the drain of the top power MOSFET . To \nprevent large voltage transients from occurring, a low \nESR input capacitor sized for the maximum RMS current \nshould be used. The maximum RMS current is given by :\n  IRMS≅IOUT(MAX)VOUT\nVINVIN\nVOUT−1\nThis formula has a maximum at V IN = 2VOUT, where\n IRMS≅IOUT\n2\nThis simple worst-case condition is commonly used for \ndesign because even significant deviations do not offer \nmuch relief. Note that ripple current ratings from capaci -\ntor manufacturers are often based on only 2000 hours of \nlife which makes it advisable to further derate the capaci -\ntor , or choose a capacitor rated at a higher temperature \nthan required. Several capacitors may also be paralleled \nto meet size or height requirements in the design. For low \nLTC7150 S/LTC7150 S-4\n13\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\ninput voltage applications, sufficient bulk input capaci -\ntance is needed to minimize transient effects during out -\nput load changes.\nOutput Capacitor (C OUT) Selection\nThe selection of C OUT is determined by the effective series \nresistance (ESR) that is required to minimize voltage rip -\nple and load step transients as well as the amount of bulk \ncapacitance that is necessary to ensure that the control \nloop is stable. Loop stability can be checked by viewing \nthe load transient response. The output ripple, ∆ VOUT, is \ndetermined by :\n ΔVOUT<ΔIL1\n8•f•COUT+ESR⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nThe output ripple is highest at maximum input volt-age \nsince ∆I L increases with input voltage. Multiple capacitors \nplaced in parallel may be needed to meet the ESR and \nRMS current handling requirements. Dry tantalum, spe -\ncial polymer , aluminum electrolytic, and ceramic capaci -\ntors are all available in surface mount packages.  Special \npolymer capacitors are very low ESR but have lower \ncapacitance density than other types. Tantalum capacitors \nhave the highest capacitance density but it is important \nto only use types that have been surge tested for use in \nswitching power supplies. Aluminum electrolytic capaci -\ntors have significantly higher ESR, but can be used in \ncost-sensitive applications provided that consideration \nis given to ripple current ratings and long-term reliability.  \nCeramic capacitors have excellent low ESR characteristics \nand small footprints. \nUsing Ceramic Input and Output Capacitors\nHigher values, lower cost ceramic capacitors are now \nbecoming available in smaller case sizes. Their high ripple \ncurrent, high voltage rating and low ESR make them ideal \nfor switching regulator applications. However , care must \nbe taken when these capacitors are used at the input and \noutput. When a ceramic capacitor is used at the input \nand the power is supplied by a wall adapter through long \nwires, a load step at the output can induce ringing at the VIN input. At best, this ringing can couple to the output \nand be mistaken as loop instability. At worst, a sudden \nin-rush of current through the long wires can potentially \ncause a voltage spike at V IN large enough to damage the \npart.  \nWhen choosing the input and output ceramic capacitors, \nchoose the X5R and X7R dielectric formulations. These \ndielectrics have the best temperature and voltage char -\nacteristics of all the ceramics for a given value and size.\nSince the ESR of a ceramic capacitor is so low, the input \nand output capacitor must instead fulfill a charge stor -\nage requirement. During a load step, the output capaci -\ntor must instantaneously supply the current to support \nthe load until the feedback loop raises the switch cur -\nrent enough to support the load. Typically, 5 cycles are \nrequired to respond to a load step, but only in the first \ncycle does the output voltage drop linearly. The output \ndroop, V DROOP , is usually about 3 times the linear drop of \nthe first cycle.  Thus, a good place to start with the output \ncapacitor value is approximately :\n COUT=3ΔIOUT\nfO•VDROOP\nMore capacitance may be required depending on the duty \ncycle and load step requirements. In most applications, \nthe input capacitor is merely required to supply high fre -\nquency bypassing, since the impedance to the supply is \nvery low. A 47μF  ceramic capacitor is usually enough for \nthese conditions. Place this input capacitor as close to the \nPVIN pin as possible.\nInductor Selection\nGiven the desired input and output voltages, the induc -\ntor value and operating frequency determine the ripple \ncurrent :\n IL=VOUT\nf•L1VOUT\nVIN\nLower ripple current reduces core losses in the inductor , \nESR losses in the output capacitors and output voltage \nLTC7150 S/LTC7150 S-4\n14\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nripple. Highest efficiency operation is obtained at low fre -\nquency with small ripple current. However , achieving this \nrequires a large inductor . There is a trade-off between \ncomponent size, efficiency and operating frequency.  \nA reasonable starting point is to choose a ripple current \nthat is about 50% of I OUT(MAX) . To guarantee that ripple \ncurrent does not exceed a specified maximum, the induc -\ntance should be chosen according to :\n L=VOUT\nf•IL(MAX)1VOUT\nVIN(MAX)\nOnce the value for L is known, the type of inductor must \nbe selected. Actual core loss is independent of core size \nfor a fixed inductor value, but is very dependent on the \ninductance selected. As the inductance or frequency \nincreases, core losses decrease. Unfortunately, increased \ninductance requires more turns of wire and therefore cop -\nper losses will increase.\nFerrite designs have very low core losses and are pre -\nferred at high switching frequencies, so design goals can \nconcentrate on copper loss and preventing saturation.  \nFerrite core material saturates “hard," which means that \ninductance collapses abruptly when the peak design cur -\nrent is exceeded. This results in an abrupt increase in \ninductor ripple current and consequent output voltage \nripple. Do not allow the core to saturate!\nDifferent core materials and shapes will change the size/\ncurrent and price/current relationship of an inductor .  \nToroid or shielded pot cores in ferrite or permalloy materi -\nals are small and don ’t radiate much energy, but generally \ncost more than powdered iron core inductors with similar characteristics. The choice of which style inductor to use \nmainly depends on the price versus size requirements \nand any radiated field/EMI requirements. New designs for \nsurface mount inductors are available from Toko, Vishay, \nNEC/Tokin, Cooper , TDK and Wurth Elektronik. Refer to \nTable 2 for more details.\nChecking T ransient Response\nThe OPTI-LOOP compensation allows the transient \nresponse to be optimized for a wide range of loads and \noutput capacitors. The availability of the ITH pin not only \nallows for optimization of the control loop behavior but \nalso provides a DC coupled and AC filtered closed loop \nresponse test point. The DC step, rise time and settling \nat this test point truly reflects these close loop response.  \nAssuming a predominantly second order system, phase \nmargin and/or damping factor can be estimated using the \npercentage of overshoot seen at this pin.\nThe ITH external component shown in the table 1 circuit \nwill provide an adequate starting point for most appli -\ncations. The RC filter sets the dominant pole-zero loop \ncompensation. The values can be modified slightly (from \n0.5 to 2 times their suggested value) to optimize transient \nresponse once the final PC layout is done and the particu -\nlar output capacitor type and value have been determined. \nThe output capacitors need to be selected because their \nvarious types and values determine the loop feedback \nfactor gain and phase. An output current pulse of 20% \nto 100% of full load current having a rise time of 1µs to \n10µs  will produce output voltage and ITH pin waveforms \nthat will give a sense of the overall loop stability without \nbreaking the feedback loop.\nSwitching regulators take several cycles to respond to \na step in load current.

During this recovery \ntime, V OUT can be monitored for overshoot or ringing that \nwould indicate a stability problem.\nThe initial output voltage step may not be within the \nbandwidth of the feedback loop, so the standard second \norder overshoot/DC ratio cannot be used to determine \nphase margin. The gain of the loop increases with the R ITH \nand the bandwidth of the loop increases with decreasing \nCITH. If R ITH  is increased by the same factor that C ITH  \nis decreased, the zero frequency will be kept the same, \nthereby keeping the phase the same in most critical fre -\nquency ranges of the feedback loop.\nThe output voltage settling behavior is related to the sta -\nbility of the closed-loop system and will demonstrate the \nactual overall supply performance. For detailed explana -\ntion of optimizing the compensation components, includ -\ning a review of control loop theory, refer to Analog Devices \nApplication Note 76.\nIn some applications, a more severe transient can be \ncaused by switching in loads with large ( >47µF ) input \ncapacitors.  The discharge input capacitors are effectively \nput in parallel with C OUT, causing a rapid drop in V OUT. No \nregulator can deliver enough current to prevent this prob -\nlem if the switch connecting the load has low resistance \nand is driven quickly. The solution is to limit the turn-on \nspeed of the load switch driver . A Hot Swap ™ control -\nler is designed specifically for this purpose and usually \nincorporates current limiting, short-circuit protection, and \nsoft-starting.\nEfficiency Considerations\nThe percent efficiency of a switching regulator is equal to \nthe output power divided by the input power times 100%.  \nIt is often useful to analyze individual losses to determine \nwhat is limiting the efficiency and which change would \nproduce the most improvement. Percent efficiency can \nbe expressed as :\n % Efficiency = 100% – (L1 + L2 + L3 +…)where L1, L2, etc. are the individual losses as a percent -\nage of input power . Although all dissipative elements in \nthe circuit produce losses, three main sources usually \naccount for most of the losses in LTC7150 S circuits : \n1) I2R losses, 2) switching and biasing losses, 3) other \nlosses.\n1. I2R losses are calculated from the DC resistances of \nthe internal switches, R SW, and external inductor , R L. \nIn continuous mode, the average output current flows \nthrough inductor L but is “chopped ” between the inter -\nnal top and bottom power MOSFETs. Thus, the series \nresistance looking into the SW pin is a function of both \ntop and bottom MOSFET R DS(ON)  and the duty cycle \n(DC) as follows :\n  R SW = (RDS(ON)TOP )(DC) + (R DS(ON)BOT )(1-DC)\n The R DS(ON)  for both the top and bottom MOSFETs \ncan be obtained from the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics  curves. Thus to obtain I2R losses :\n  I2R losses = IOUT2(RSW + R L)\n2. The switching current is the sum of the MOSFET driver \nand control currents. The power MOSFET driver cur -\nrent results from switching the gate capacitance of the \npower MOSFETs. Each time a power MOSFET gate is \nswitched from low to high to low again, a packet of \ncharge dQ moves from IN to ground. The resulting dQ/\ndt is a current out of IN that is typically much larger \nthan the DC control bias current. In continuous mode, \nIGATECHG = f(QT + Q B), where Q T and Q B are the gate \ncharges of the internal top and bottom power MOSFETs \nand f is the switching frequency. The power loss is \nthus:\n  Switching Loss = IGATECHG  • VIN \n The gate charge loss shows up as current through the \nINTV CC LDO and becomes larger as frequency increases. \nThus, their effects will be more pronounced in applica -\ntions with higher input voltage and higher frequency.\n3. Other “hidden ” losses such as transition loss and cop -\nper trace and internal load resistances can account for \nadditional efficiency degradations in the overall power \nsystem. It is very important to include these “system ” \nlevel losses in the design of a system. T ransition loss \nLTC7150S/LT C7150S-4\n16\nRev.

In general, \na thick continuous piece of copper on the top layer of the \nPCB for SW and GND pins will greatly improve the thermal \nperformance of the part.  \nFigure\xa03  to Figure\xa08  shows typical derating curves of the \nLTC7150 S on a standard 6-layer , 2oz copper per layer PCB \nboard ( LTC7150 S standard demo board). V OUT is set to \n1.2V in all curves.\nSilent Switcher Architecture\nThe LTC7150 S has integrated capacitors that allow it \nto operate at high switching frequencies efficiently. The \ninternal V IN bypass capacitors allow the SW edges to \ntransition extremely fast, effectively reducing transition loss. The capacitors also greatly reduces SW overshoot \nduring top FET turn-on which improves the robustness \nof the device over time.\nBoard Layout Considerations\nWhen laying out the printed circuit board, the following \nchecklist should be used to ensure proper operation of \nthe LTC7150 S (refer to Figure\xa09 ). Check the following in \nyour layout :\n1. Are there pairs of capacitors (C IN) between V IN and \nGND as close as possible on both sides of the package ?  \nThese capacitors provide the AC current to the internal \npower MOSFETs and their drivers as well as minimize \nEUI/EMC emissions.\n2. Are C OUT and L closely connected ? The ( –) plate of \nCOUT returns current to GND and the ( –) plate of C IN.\nFigure\xa09. Example of Top Layer PCB Design\nCIN CIN\nLTC7150 S/LTC7150 S-4\n18\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\n3. Place the FB dividers close to the part with Kelvin con -\nnections to V OUT and V OUT– at the point of load, for \ndifferential V OUT sensing.  \n4. Keep sensitive components away from the SW pin. The \nFB resistors, R T resistor , the compensation component, \nand the INTV CC bypass caps should be routed away \nfrom the SW trace and the inductor .\n5. A ground plane is preferred.\n6. Flood all unused areas on all layers with copper , which \nreduces the temperature rise of power components. \nThese copper areas should be connected to GND. \nDesign Example\nAs a design example, consider the LTC7150 S in an appli -\ncation with the following specifications :\n V IN = 12V to 15V\n V OUT = 1.2V\n IOUT(MAX)  = 20A\n IOUT(MIN)  = 1A\n fSW = 1MHz\nFirst, R FB1 and R FB2 should be the same value in order to \nprogram the output to 1.2V. A typical value that can be \nused here for both resistors is 10kΩ . For best accuracy, \na 0.1% resistor should be used.For a typical soft start time of 2ms (0% to 100% of final \nVOUT value), the C TRACK/SS  should be :\n  6µA=CTRACK/SS•0.6V\n2ms\n C TRACK/SS  = 20nF\nA typical 22nF  capacitor can be used for C TRACK/SS .\nBecause efficiency is important at both high and low load \ncurrent, discontinuous mode operation will be utilized.  \nSelect from the characteristic curves the correct R T resis -\ntor for the 1MHz  switching frequency. Based on that, R T \nshould be 162kΩ . Then calculate the inductor value to \nachieve a current ripple that is about 40% of the maximum \noutput current ( 20A) at maximum V IN:\n L=1.2V\n1MHz•8A⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟1−1.2V\n15V⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟=0.138 µH\nThe closest standard value inductor higher would be \n0.15µH .\nCOUT will be selected based on the ESR that is required to \nsatisfy the output ripple requirement and the bulk capaci -\ntance needed for loop stability. For this design, two 100µF  \nceramic capacitors will be used.\nCIN should be sized for a maximum current rating of :\n IRMS=20A1.2V\n15V⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟15V\n1.2V−1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟1/2\n=5.4A\nDecoupling V IN with two 22µF  ceramic capacitors, as \nshown in Figure\xa09 , is adequate for most applications.\nLTC7150 S/LTC7150 S-4\n19\nRev.
