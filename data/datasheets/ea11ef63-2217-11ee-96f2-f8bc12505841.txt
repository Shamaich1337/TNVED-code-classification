If \n0.254mm (10 mil) thick alumina thin film substrates must be used, the die should be \nraised 0.150mm (6 mils) so that the surface of the die is coplanar with the surface \nof the substrate.  One way to accomplish this is to attach the 0.102mm (4 mil) thick \ndie to a 0.150mm (6 mil) thick molybdenum heat spreader (moly-tab) which is then \nattached to the ground plane (Figure 2).\nMicrostrip substrates should be brought as close to the die as possible in order to \nminimize bond wire length.  Typical die-to-substrate spacing is 0.076mm (3 mils).\nHandling Precautions\nFollow these precautions to avoid permanent damage.\nStorage:  All bare die are placed in either Waffle or Gel based ESD protective \ncontainers, and then sealed in an ESD protective bag for shipment. Once the \nsealed ESD protective bag has been opened, all die should be stored in a dry \nnitrogen environment.\nCleanliness:  Handle the chips in a clean environment. DO NOT attempt to clean \nthe chip using liquid cleaning systems.\nStatic Sensitivity:  Follow ESD precautions to protect against > ± 250V ESD \nstrikes.\nTransients:  Suppress instrument and bias supply transients while bias is applied. \nUse shielded signal and bias cables to minimize inductive pick-up.\nGeneral Handling:  Handle the chip along the edges with a vacuum collet or with \na sharp pair of bent tweezers. The surface of the chip has fragile air bridges and \nshould not be touched with vacuum collet, tweezers, or fingers.\nMounting\nThe chip is back-metallized and can be die mounted with AuSn eutectic preforms or \nwith electrically conductive epoxy. The mounting surface should be clean and flat.\nEutectic Die Attach:  A 80/20 gold tin preform is recommended with a work \nsurface temperature of 255 °C and a tool temperature of 265 °C.  When hot 90/10 nitrogen/hydrogen gas is applied, tool tip \ntemperature should be 290 °C. DO NOT expose the chip to a temperature greater than 320 °C for more than 20 seconds.  No more \nthan 3 seconds of scrubbing should be required for attachment.\nEpoxy Die Attach:  Apply a minimum amount of epoxy to the mounting surface so that a thin epoxy fillet is observed around the \nperimeter of the chip once it is placed into position.  Cure epoxy per the manufacturer’s schedule.\nWire Bonding\nBall or wedge bond with 0.025 mm (1 mil) diameter pure gold wire  is recommended. Thermosonic wirebonding with a nominal stage \ntemperature of 150 °C and a ball bonding force of 40 to 50 grams or wedge bonding force of 18 to 22 grams is recommended.  Use \nthe minimum level of ultrasonic energy to achieve reliable wirebonds.  Wirebonds should be started on the chip and terminated on \nthe package or substrate.  All bonds should be as short as possible <0.31 mm (12 mils).0.102mm (0.004”) Thick GaAs MMIC\nWire Bond\nRF Ground Plane\n0.127mm (0.005”) Thick Alumina\nThin Film Substrate0.076mm\n(0.003”)\nFigure 1.\n0.102mm (0.004”) Thick GaAs MMIC\nWire Bond\nRF Ground Plane\n0.254mm (0.010”) Thick Alumina\nThin Film Substrate0.076mm\n(0.003”)\nFigure 2.0.150mm (0.005”) Thick\nMoly Tab\n'}]
