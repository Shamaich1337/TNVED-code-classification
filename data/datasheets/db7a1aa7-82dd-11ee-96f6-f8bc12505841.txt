They are intended for \napplications using a MIL-STD-1553 A/B data bus. \nTransmitter\nData is input to the device’s transmitter section from \nthe complementary CMOS inputs TXA/B and TXA/B .  \nThe transmitter accepts Manchester II bi-phase data \nand converts it to differential voltages which drive the \ninternal transformers on BUSA/B and BUSA/B .  The \ntransformer outputs are either direct or transformer \ncoupled to the MIL-STD-1553 data bus.  Both coupling \nmethods produce a nominal voltage on the main bus of \n7.5 volts peak to peak.\nThe transmitter is automatically inhibited and placed in \nthe high impedance state when both TXA/B and TXA/B \nare either at a logic “1” or logic “0” simultaneously. A logic \n“1” applied to the TXINHA/B input forces the transmitter \nto the high impedance state, regardless of the state of \nTXA/B and TXA/B . \nReceiver\nThe receiver accepts bi-phase differential data from \nthe MIL-STD-1553 bus through the same direct or \ntransformer coupled interface as the transmitter.  The \nreceiver’s differential input stage includes a filter and threshold comparator that produces CMOS data at the \nRXA/B and RXA/B  output pins. When the MIL-STD-1553 \nbus is idle and RXENA or RXENB are high, RXA/B will \nbe logic “0” on HI-2579 and logic “1” on HI-2581. \nEach set of receiver outputs can also be independently \nforced to the bus idle state (logic “0” on HI-2579 or logic \n“1” on HI-2581) by setting RXENA or RXENB low. \nMIL-STD-1553 Bus Interface\nThere are two ways of connecting to the MIL-STD-1553 \nbus, using a direct coupled interface or a transformer \ncoupled interface (see Figure 3 ). \nA direct coupled interface uses the internal 1:2.5 ratio \nisolation transformer and two 55Ω isolation resistors \nbetween the transformer and the bus.\nIn a transformer coupled interface, the transceiver is \nconnected to the internal 1:2.5 isolation transformer \nwhich in turn is connected to a 1:1.4 coupling transformer. \nThe transformer coupled method also requires two \ncoupling resistors equal to 75% of the bus characteristic \nimpedance (Zo) between the coupling transformer and \nthe bus. The coupling transformer and coupling resistors \nare commonly integrated in a single device known as a  \nstub coupler. \nFigure 4  and Figure 5  show test circuits for measuring \nelectrical characteristics of both direct and transformer \ncoupled interfaces respectively (see “Electrical \nCharacteristics”  on the following pages) . \nABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS \nSupply voltage (VDD) -0.3 V to +5 V\nLogic input voltage range -0.3 V DC to +3.6 V\nReceiver differential voltage 50 Vp-p\nDriver peak output current +1.0 A\nPower dissipation at 25°C 1.0 W\nSolder Temperature 245oC max.\nJunction Temperature 175oC\nStorage Temperature -65oC to +150oCRECOMMENDED OPERATING \nCONDITIONS\nSupply Voltage VDD 3.3V ± 5%\nTemperature Range  \nIndustrial Screening \nHi-Temp Screening-40oC to +85oC \n-55oC to +125oC \nNOTE:  Stresses above absolute maximum  ratings or outside \nrecommended operating conditions may cause permanent \ndamage to the device.
