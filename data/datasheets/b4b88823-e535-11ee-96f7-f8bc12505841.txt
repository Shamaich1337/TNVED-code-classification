This efficiency is achieved through highly integrated packaging technology and\nthe implementation of a custom power stage and control device. The DCP01B devices are specified for\noperational isolation only.

Typically, this\nisolation is defined as the use of insulated wire in the construction of the transformer as the primary isolation\nbarrier. The hipot one-second duration test (dielectric voltage, withstand test) is a production test used to verify\nthat the isolation barrier is functioning. Products with operational isolation must never be used as an element in a\nsafety-isolation system.\n7.3.1.2 Basic or Enhanced Isolation\nBasic or enhanced isolation is defined by specified creepage and clearance limits between the primary and\nsecondary circuits of the power supply. Basic isolation is the use of an isolation barrier in addition to the\ninsulated wire in the construction of the transformer. Input and output circuits must also be physically separated\nby specified distances.\n7.3.1.3 Continuous Voltage\nFor a device that has no specific safety agency approvals (operational isolation), the continuous voltage that can\nbe applied across the part in normal operation is less than 42.5 V RMS, or 60 V DC. Ensure that both input and\noutput voltages maintain normal SELV limits. The isolation test voltage represents a measure of immunity to\ntransient voltages.\nWARNING\nDo not use the device as an element of a safety isolation system that exceeds the SELV limit.\nIf the device is expected to function correctly with more than 42.5 V RMS or 60 V DC applied continuously across\nthe isolation barrier, then the circuitry on both sides of the barrier must be regarded as operating at an unsafe\nvoltage, and further isolation or insulation systems must form a barrier between these circuits and any user-\naccessible circuitry according to safety standard requirements.\n7.3.1.4 Isolation Voltage\nThe terms Hipot test , flash-tested , withstand voltage , proof voltage , dielectric withstand voltage , and isolation\ntest voltage  all describe a similar idea. They describe a test voltage applied for a specified time across a\ncomponent designed to provide electrical isolation to verify the integrity of that isolation. TI’s DCP01B series of\nDC/DC converters are all 100% production tested at 1.0 kV AC for one second.\n7.3.1.5 Repeated High-Voltage Isolation Testing\nRepeated high-voltage isolation testing of a barrier component can degrade the isolation capability, depending\non materials, construction, and environment. The DCP01B series of DC/DC converters have toroidal, enameled,\nwire isolation transformers with no additional insulation between the primary and secondary windings. While a\ndevice can be expected to withstand several times the stated test voltage, the isolation capability depends on\nthe wire insulation. Any material, including this enamel (typically polyurethane), is susceptible to eventual\nchemical degradation when subject to very-high applied voltages. Therefore, strictly limit the number of high-\nvoltage tests and repeated high-voltage isolation testing. However, if it is absolutely required, reduce the voltage\nby 20% from specified test voltage with a duration limit of one second per test.www.ti.comDCP010505B, DCP010512B, DCP010515B, DCP012405B, DCP010505DB, DCP010507DB,\nDCP010512DB, DCP010515DB, DCP011512DB, DCP011515DB, DCP012415DB\nSBVS012I – DECEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: DCP010505B  DCP010512B  DCP010515B  DCP012405B  DCP010505DB  DCP010507DB\nDCP010512DB  DCP010515DB  DCP011512DB  DCP011515DB  DCP012415DB\n7.3.2 Power Stage\nThe DCP01B series of devices uses a push-pull, center-tapped topology. The DCP01B devices switch at 400\nkHz (divide-by-2 from an 800-kHz oscillator).\n7.3.3 Oscillator And Watchdog Circuit\nThe onboard, 800-kHz oscillator generates the switching frequency by a divide-by-2 circuit. The oscillator can be\nsynchronized to other DCP01B series device circuits or an external source, and is used to minimize system\nnoise.\nA watchdog circuit checks the operation of the oscillator circuit. The oscillator can be disabled by pulling the\nSYNC IN pin low. When the SYNC IN pin goes low, the output pins transition into tri-state mode, which occurs\nwithin 2 μs.\n7.3.4 Thermal Shutdown\nThe DCP01B series of devices are protected by a thermal-shutdown circuit.\nIf the on-chip temperature rises above 150°C, the device shuts down. Normal operation resumes as soon as the\ntemperature falls below 150°C. While the over temperature condition continues, operation randomly cycles on\nand off. This cycling continues until the temperature is reduced.\n7.3.5 Synchronization\nWhen more than one DC/DC converter is needed onboard, beat frequencies and other electrical interference\ncan be generated. This interference occurs because of the small variations in switching frequencies between the\nDC/DC converters.\nThe DCP01B series of devices overcomes this interference by allowing devices to synchronize to one another.\nSynchronize up to eight devices by connecting the SYNC pins of each device, taking care to minimize the\ncapacitance of tracking. Stray capacitance (greater than 3 pF) reduces the switching frequency, or can\nsometimes stop the oscillator circuit. The maximum recommended voltage applied to the SYNC pin is 3.0 V.\nFor an application that uses more than eight synchronized devices, use an external device to drive the SYNC\npins. The application report External Synchronization of the DCP01/02 Series of DC/DC Converters  describes\nthis configuration.\nNote\nDuring the start-up period, all synchronized devices draw maximum current from the input\nsimultaneously. If the input voltage falls below approximately 4 V, the devices may not start up.\nA 2.2-μF capacitor should be connected close to each device input pin.\n7.3.6 Light Load Operation (< 10%)\nOperation below 10% load can cause the output voltage to increase up to double the typical output voltage. For\napplications that operate less than 10% of rated output current, it is recommended to add a minimum load to\nensure the output voltage of the device is within the load regulation range. For example, connect a 250-Ω pre-\nload resistor to meet the 10% minimum load condition for the DCP010505BP.\n7.3.7 Load Regulation (10% to 100%)\nThe load regulation of the DCP01B series of devices is specified at 10% to 100% load. Placing a minimum 10%\nload will ensure the output voltage is within the range specified in Section 6.5 . For more information regarding\noperation below 10% load, see Section 7.3.6 .\n7.3.8 Construction\nThe basic construction of the DCP01B series of devices is the same as standard integrated circuits. The molded\npackage contains no substrate. The DCP01B series of devices are constructed using an IC, rectifier diodes, and\na wound magnetic toroid on a lead frame. Because the package contains no solder, the devices do not require\nany special printed circuit board (PCB) assembly processing. This architecture results in an isolated DC/DC\nconverter with inherently high reliability.DCP010505B, DCP010512B, DCP010515B, DCP012405B, DCP010505DB, DCP010507DB, DCP010512DB,\nDCP010515DB, DCP011512DB, DCP011515DB, DCP012415DB\nSBVS012I – DECEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DCP010505B  DCP010512B  DCP010515B  DCP012405B  DCP010505DB  DCP010507DB\nDCP010512DB  DCP010515DB  DCP011512DB  DCP011515DB  DCP012415DB\n7.3.9 Thermal Management\nDue to the high power density of these devices, it is advisable to provide ground planes on the input and output\nrails.\n7.3.10 Power-Up Characteristics\nThe DCP01B series of devices do not include a soft-start feature. Therefore, a high in-rush current during power\nup is expected. Refer to the DCPA1 series  of devices for a 1-W, isolated, unregulated DC/DC converter module\nwith soft start included. Figure 7-3  shows the typical start-up waveform for a DCP010505BP, operating from a 5-\nV input with no load on the output. Figure 7-4  shows the start-up waveform for a DCP010505BP starting up into\na 10% load. Figure 7-5  shows the start-up waveform starting up into a full (100%) load.\nFigure 7-3.

If the SYNC IN pin is pulled low, the DCP01B becomes disabled. The disable time depends upon the\nexternal loading. The internal disable function is implemented within 2 μs. Removal of the pulldown causes the\nDCP01B to be enabled.\nCapacitive loading on the SYNC IN pin must be minimized (≤ 3 pF) to prevent a reduction in the oscillator\nfrequency. The application report External Synchronization of the DCP01/02 Series of DC/DC Converters\ndescribes disable and enable control circuitry.\n7.4.2 Decoupling\n7.4.2.1 Ripple Reduction\nThe high switching frequency of 400 kHz allows simple filtering. To reduce ripple, it is recommended that a\nminimum of 1-μF capacitor be used on the +V OUT pin. For dual output devices, decouple both of the outputs to\nthe COM pin. The required 2.2-μF, low ESR ceramic input capacitor also helps reduce ripple and noise, (24-V\ninput voltage versions require only 0.47 µF of input capacitance). See application report DC-to-DC Converter\nNoise Reduction .\n7.4.2.2 Connecting the DCP01B in Series\nMultiple DCP01B isolated 1-W DC/DC converters can be connected in series to provide non-standard voltage\nrails. This configuration is possible by using the floating outputs provided by the galvanic isolation of the DCP01.\nConnect the +V OUT from one DCP01B to the –V OUT of another (see Figure 7-6 ). If the SYNC IN pins are tied\ntogether, the self-synchronization feature of the DCP01B prevents beat frequencies on the voltage rails. The\nsynchronization feature of the DCP01B allows easy series connection without external filtering, thus minimizing\ncost.\nVIN \nCOUT \n1.0 µF DCP 01B+VS\nSYNC IN \n–VS+VOUT1\n–VOUT1\nCOUT \n1.0 µF DCP 01BVS\nSYNC IN \n–VS+VOUT2\n–VOUT2CIN CIN \nVOUT1\n+ \nVOUT2\nFigure 7-6.

Load Regulation\n8.2.4 PCB Design\nThe copper losses (resistance and inductance) can be minimized by the use of mutual ground and power planes\n(tracks) where possible. If that is not possible, use wide tracks to reduce the losses. If several devices are being\npowered from a common power source, a star-connected system for the track must be deployed. Do not connect\nthe devices in series, because that type of connection cascades the resistive losses. The position of the\ndecoupling capacitors is important. They must be as close to the devices as possible in order to reduce losses.\nSee Section 10  for more details.\n8.2.5 Decoupling Ceramic Capacitors\nAll capacitors have losses because of internal equivalent series resistance (ESR), and to a lesser degree,\nequivalent series inductance (ESL). Values for ESL are not always easy to obtain. However, some\nmanufacturers provide graphs of frequency versus capacitor impedance. These graphs typically show the\ncapacitor impedance falling as frequency is increased (as shown in Figure 8-4 ). In Figure 8-4 , XC is the\nreactance due to the capacitance, X L is the reactance due to the ESL, and f 0 is the resonant frequency. As the\nfrequency increases, the impedance stops decreasing and begins to rise. The point of minimum impedance\nindicates the resonant frequency of the capacitor. This frequency is where the components of capacitance and\ninductance reactance are of equal magnitude. Beyond this point, the capacitor is not effective as a capacitor.\nFrequency (Hz)Capacitor Impedance ( \x9f )\nf0XC\nXL\n0Z\nFigure 8-4.

The output capacitor\'s resonant frequency must be higher than the default switching frequency\n(800 kHz) of the device to properly decouple noise at and below the switching frequency.DCP010505B, DCP010512B, DCP010515B, DCP012405B, DCP010505DB, DCP010507DB, DCP010512DB,\nDCP010515DB, DCP011512DB, DCP011515DB, DCP012415DB\nSBVS012I – DECEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DCP010505B  DCP010512B  DCP010515B  DCP012405B  DCP010505DB  DCP010507DB\nDCP010512DB  DCP010515DB  DCP011512DB  DCP011515DB  DCP012415DB\nThe effect of the ESR is to cause a voltage drop within the capacitor. The value of this voltage drop is simply the\nproduct of the ESR and the transient load current, as shown in Equation 1 .\nVIN = V PK – (ESR × I TR) (1)\nwhere\n• V IN is the voltage at the device input\n• V PK is the maximum value of the voltage on the capacitor during charge\n• I TR is the transient load current\nThe other factor that affects the performance is the value of the capacitance. However, for the input and the full\nwave outputs (single-output voltage devices), ESR is the dominant factor.\n8.2.6 Input Capacitor and the Effects of ESR\nIf the input decoupling capacitor is not ceramic (and has an ESR greater than  20 mΩ), then at the instant the\npower transistors switch on, the voltage at the input pins falls momentarily. If the voltage falls below\napproximately 4 V, the device detects an undervoltage condition and switches the internal drive circuits to a\nmomentary off state. This detection is carried out as a precaution against a genuine low input voltage condition\nthat could slow down or even stop the internal circuits from operating correctly. A slow-down or stoppage results\nin the drive transistors being turned on too long, causing saturation of the transformer and destruction of the\ndevice.\nFollowing detection of a low input voltage condition, the device switches off the internal drive circuits until the\ninput voltage returns to a safe value, at which time the device tries to restart. If the input capacitor is still unable\nto maintain the input voltage, shutdown recurs. This process repeats until the input capacitor charges sufficiently\nto start the device correctly.\nNormal start-up should occur in approximately 1 ms after power is applied to the device. If a considerably longer\nstart-up duration time is encountered, it is likely that either (or both) the input supply or the capacitors are not\nperforming adequately.\nFor 5-V to 15-V input devices, a 2.2-μF, low-ESR ceramic capacitor ensures good startup performance. For 24-V\ninput voltage devices, 0.47-μF ceramic capacitors are recommended. Tantalum capacitors are not\nrecommended, since most do not have low-ESR values and will degrade performance. If tantalum capacitors\nmust be used, close attention must be paid to both the ESR and voltage as derated by the vendor.\nNote\nDuring the start-up period, these devices may draw maximum current from the input supply. If\nthe input voltage falls below approximately 4 V, the devices may not start up. Connect a 2.2-μF\nceramic capacitor close to the input pins.\n8.2.7 Ripple and Noise\nA good quality, low-ESR ceramic capacitor placed as close as practical across the input reduces reflected ripple\nand ensures a smooth start-up.\nA good quality, low-ESR ceramic capacitor placed as close as practical across the rectifier output terminal and\noutput ground gives the best ripple and noise performance. See application report DC-to-DC Converter Noise\nReduction  for more information on noise rejection.\n8.2.7.1 Output Ripple Calculation Example\nThe following example shows that increasing the capacitance has a much smaller effect on the output ripple\nvoltage than does reducing the value of the ESR for the filter capacitor.\nTo calculate the output ripple for a DCP010505 device:\n• V OUT = 5 V\n• I OUT = 0.2 Awww.ti.comDCP010505B, DCP010512B, DCP010515B, DCP012405B, DCP010505DB, DCP010507DB,\nDCP010512DB, DCP010515DB, DCP011512DB, DCP011515DB, DCP012415DB\nSBVS012I – DECEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: DCP010505B  DCP010512B  DCP010515B  DCP012405B  DCP010505DB  DCP010507DB\nDCP010512DB  DCP010515DB  DCP011512DB  DCP011515DB  DCP012415DB\n• At full output power, the load resistor is 25 Ω\n• Ceramic output capacitor of 1 μF, ESR of 0.1 Ω\n• Capacitor discharge time 1% of 800 kHz (ripple frequency)\ntDIS = 0.0125 μs\nτ = C × R LOAD\nτ = 1 × 10-6 × 12.5 = 12.5 μs\nVDIS = V O(1 – EXP(–t DIS / τ))\nVDIS = 5 mV\nBy contrast, the voltage dropped because of ESR:\nVESR = ILOAD × ESR\nVESR = 20 mV\nRipple voltage = 25 mV\n8.2.8 Dual DCP01B Output Voltage\nThe voltage output for dual DCP01B devices is half wave rectified; therefore, the discharge time is 1.25 μs.\nRepeating the above calculations using the 100% load resistance of 50 Ω (0.1 A per output), the results are:\nτ = 25 μs\ntDIS = 1.25 μs\nVDIS = 244 mV\nVESR = 10 mV\nRipple Voltage = 133 mV\nThis time, it is the capacitor discharging that contributes to the largest component of ripple. Changing the output\nfilter to 10 μF, and repeating the calculations, the result is:\nRipple voltage = 25 mV\nThis value is composed of almost equal components.\nThe previous calculations are offered as a guideline only. Capacitor parameters usually have large tolerances\nand can be susceptible to environmental conditions.\n8.2.9 Optimizing Performance\nOptimum performance can only be achieved if the device is correctly supported. The very nature of a switching\nconverter requires power to be instantly available when it switches on. If the converter has DMOS switching\ntransistors, the fast edges will create a high current demand on the input supply. This transient load placed on\nthe input is supplied by the external input decoupling capacitor, thus maintaining the input voltage. Therefore, the\ninput supply does not see this transient (this is an analogy to high-speed digital circuits). The positioning of the\ncapacitor is critical and must be placed as close as possible to the input pins and connected via a low-\nimpedance path.\nThe optimum performance primarily depends on two factors:\n• Connection of the input and output circuits for minimal loss.\n• The ability of the decoupling capacitors to maintain the input and output voltages at a constant level.\n9 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe DCP01B is a switching power supply, and as such can place high peak current demands on the input\nsupply. To avoid the supply falling momentarily during the fast switching pulses, ground and power planes must\nbe used to connect the power to the input of DCP01 device. If this connection is not possible, then the supplies\nmust be connected in a star formation with the traces made as wide as possible.DCP010505B, DCP010512B, DCP010515B, DCP012405B, DCP010505DB, DCP010507DB, DCP010512DB,\nDCP010515DB, DCP011512DB, DCP011515DB, DCP012415DB\nSBVS012I – DECEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DCP010505B  DCP010512B  DCP010515B  DCP012405B  DCP010505DB  DCP010507DB\nDCP010512DB  DCP010515DB  DCP011512DB  DCP011515DB  DCP012415DB\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nDue to the high power density of these devices, provide ground planes on the input and output rails.\nFigure 10-1  and Figure 10-2  show the schematic for the two DIP through-hole packages, and two SOP surface-\nmount packages for the DCP family of products which include DCP01B, DCP02, DCV01, DCR01, and DCR02.\nFigure 10-3  and Figure 10-4  illustrate a printed circuit board (PCB) layout for the schematics.\nIncluding input power and ground planes provides a low-impedance path for the input power. For the output, the\nCOM signal connects via a ground plane, while the connections for the positive and negative voltage outputs\nconduct via wide traces in order to minimize losses.\nThe output should be taken from the device using ground and power planes, thereby ensuring minimum losses.\nThe location of the decoupling capacitors in close proximity to their respective pins ensures low losses due to the\neffects of stray inductance, thus improving the ripple performance. This location is of particular importance to the\ninput decoupling capacitor, because this capacitor supplies the transient current associated with the fast\nswitching waveforms of the power drive circuits.\nAllow the unused SYNC pin, to remain configured as a floating pad. It is advisable to place a guard ring\n(connected to input ground) or annulus connected around this pin to avoid any noise pick up. When connecting a\nSYNC pin to one or more SYNC design the linking trace to be short and narrow to avoid stray capacitance.\nEnsure that no other trace is in close proximity to this trace SYNC trace to decrease the stray capacitance on\nthis pin. The stray capacitance affects the performance of the oscillator.\n10.2 Layout Example\n+VS\n–VS\nDCP02xxxxP \n+VOUT \n–VOUT 1\n2\n6\n7C1\nC2\nCOM 5\nC4C2-1\nC4-1C3\nC5R1\nR214 SYNC JP1 VS1\n0V1\n+V1\nCOM1\n– V1\n+VS\n–VS\nDCP02xxxxP \n+VOUT \n–VOUT 1\n2\n6\n7C6\nC7\nCOM 5\nC9C7-1\nC9-1C8\nC10 R3\nR414 SYNC JP2 VS2\n0V2\n+V2\nCOM2\n– V2CON1\nCON2\nFigure 10-1.
