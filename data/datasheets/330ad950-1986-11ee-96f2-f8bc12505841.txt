The SKY16602-632LF has a lower threshold level over a traditional self-bias limiter circuit with an inductor for a ground return. It accomplishes this by adding a basic PIN limiter diode (pin 1) in parallel to a Schottky diode (pin 2). The low turn on voltage of the Schottky diode reduces the threshold level while the PIN limiter diode protects the Schottky diode at higher power levels. Therefore, for maximum RF power handling, the RF input signal is required to be connected to Pin 1. The two internal DC input/output capacitors provide DC blocking needed for most applications. Tuned Circuit \nThe module may be RF tuned for optional RF match and \ninsertion loss centered at a target frequency within its normal band of operation. This is done with the use of external surface mount components. The schematic diagram in Figure 3 shows the SKY16602-632LF limiter with a shunt connected capacitor and inductor tuned for 2.45 GHz. The Bill of Materials for the 2.45 GHz tuned circuit is shown in Table 4. \nElectrical specifications for the 2.45 GHz tuned limiter module \nare provided in Table 5. \nFor additional target frequencies, refer to Table 6 for inductor \nand capacitor values. \n \n \nFigure 3.
