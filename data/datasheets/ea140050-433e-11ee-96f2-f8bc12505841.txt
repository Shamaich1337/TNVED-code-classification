Document number: ED000812C  Page | 3 \n \n1 EL320.240.36-HB Quarter-VGA display  \nThe EL320.240.36-HB thin film electroluminescent (T FEL) display is a high-performance \nalternative to quarter-VGA LCDs and the ideal solut ion in demanding applications where \nsuperior visual performance and environmental rugge dness are critical. The EL320.240.36-HB \nutilizes Lumineq ® Displays’ proprietary Integral Contrast Enhancemen t (ICEBrite™) \ntechnology to achieve unparalleled image quality wi thout the use of expensive filters. This \nsmall graphics display excels in a wide range of am bient lighting environments while \neffectively eliminating the blooming common to othe r high-bright displays. \nThe display consists of a TFEL glass panel and cont rol electronics assembled into a space-\nsaving, rugged package for easy mounting. The EL320 .240.36-HB is easily interfaced using \nstandard 4-bit LCD control signals. Each of the 76, 800 pixels is individually addressable to \nclearly display high information content graphics a nd text. \n1.1  Features and benefits \n• Excellent visual performance \n\x01 High brightness and contrast \n\x01 Wide viewing angle < 179° \n• Rapid display response < 1 ms \n• Frame buffer \n• Space-efficient mechanical package \n• Low EMI emissions \n• Extremely rugged and durable \n• Reliable, long operating life \n• 4-bit LCD-type interface \n \n2 Installation and handling \nDo not drop, bend, or flex the display. Do not allo w objects to strike the surface of the \ndisplay. \nCAUTION:  The display uses CMOS and power MOS-FET devices. T hese components are \nelectrostatic-sensitive. Unpack, assemble, and exam ine this assembly in a static-controlled \narea only. When shipping, use packing materials des igned for protection of electrostatic-\nsensitive components. \n  \n  Operation Manual  \nEL320.240.36-HB Display  \n \nBeneq Oy    \nOlarinluoma 9  Tel.  +358 9 7599 530  VAT ID FI19563372  \nFI -02200 Espoo  Fax  +358 9 7599 5310  www.beneq.com  \nFinland  lumineq@beneq.com  www.lumineq.com  \n   \nDate: August 10, 2016  Document number: ED000812C  Page | 4 \n \n2.1  Mounting TFEL displays \nProperly mounted, TFEL displays can withstand high shock loads as well as severe vibration \nfound in demanding applications. However, the glass  panel used in a TFEL display will break if \nsubjected to bending stresses, high impact, or exce ssive loads. \nAvoid bending the display. Stresses are often intro duced when a display is mounted into a \nproduct. Ideally, the mounting tabs of the display should be the only point of contact with the \nsystem. Use a spacer or boss for support; failure t o do so will bend the display and cause the \nglass to break. The instrument enclosure or frame s hould not flex or distort in such a way \nthat the bending loads might be transferred to the display during use. The EL320.240.36-HB \nmounting tabs are designed for 3 mm screws. Mountin g surfaces should be flat to within ±0.6 \nmm (±0.025"). Use all the mounting holes provided. Failure to do so will impair the shock \nand vibration resistance of the final installation.  \nCAUTION:  To prevent injury in the event of a glass breakage , a protective overlay should be \nused on the viewer side of the display. \nWARNING:  These products generate voltages capable of causin g personal injury (high \nvoltage up to 235 V AC ). Do not touch the display electronics during oper ation. \n2.2  Cable length \nA maximum cable length of 0.6 m (24 in.) is recomme nded. Longer cables may cause data \ntransfer problems between the data transmitted and the display input connector. Excessive \ncable lengths can pick up unwanted EMI.  \n2.3  Cleaning \nAs with any glass or coated surface, care should be  taken to minimize scratching. Clean the \ndisplay glass with mild, water-based detergents onl y. Apply the cleaner sparingly to a soft \ncloth, then wipe the display. Disposable cleaning c loths are recommended to minimize the \nrisk of inadvertently scratching the display with p articles embedded in a re-used cloth. \nParticular care should be taken when cleaning displ ays with anti-glare and anti-reflective \nfilms. \n2.4  Avoiding burn-in \nAs with other light-emitting displays, use a screen saver or image inversion to avoid causing \nburn-in on the display. Displaying fixed patterns o n the screen can cause burn-in where \nluminance variations can be noticed. \n  \n  Operation Manual  \nEL320.240.36-HB Display  \n \nBeneq Oy    \nOlarinluoma 9  Tel.  +358 9 7599 530  VAT ID FI19563372  \nFI -02200 Espoo  Fax  +358 9 7599 5310  www.beneq.com  \nFinland  lumineq@beneq.com  www.lumineq.com  \n   \nDate: August 10, 2016  Document number: ED000812C  Page | 5 \n \n3 Specifications \nPerformance characteristics are guaranteed when mea sured at 25 °C with rated input voltage \nunless otherwise specified. \n3.1  Control basics \nThe TFEL panel is a matrix structure with column an d row electrodes arranged in an X-Y \nformation. Light is emitted when an AC voltage of s ufficient amplitude is applied at a row-\ncolumn intersection. The display operation is based  on the symmetric, line-at-a-time data \naddressing scheme. \n3.2  Power \nThe supply voltages are shown in Table 1. All inter nal high voltages are generated from the \ndisplay supply voltage (V H). The logic supply voltage (V L) should be present whenever video \ninput signals or V H is applied. The minimum and maximum specifications  in this manual \nshould be met, without exception, to ensure the lon g-term reliability of the display. Beneq \ndoes not recommend operation of the display outside  these specifications. \nTable 1.

Beneq recommends the use of a series fuse on the 12 volt supply (V H). A \ngeneral guideline is to rate the fuse at 1.8 to 2 t imes the display maximum current rating. \n3.3  Connector \nThe display uses the Samtec EHT-110-01-S-D or equiv alent locking connector. The mating \nconnector is in the Samtec TCSD family of cable str ips. The proper connector, user-specified \ncable length and connector configuration is supplie d as a single unit.

The  display frame rate and the display \nbrightness are independent of user-supplied input d ata timing. The display frame rate can be \ncontrolled through the digital dimming feature as d escribed below. \nCAUTION:  The display includes an internal frame buffer. In order to blank the display image \nin the event of a system malfunction, pull down the  VS signal. \n3.6  Dimming \nThere are two standard methods for dimming the EL32 0.240.36-HB display. Analog dimming \nusing the J2 dimming connector described on page 7 of this manual allows for manual \ndimming from 100% to approximately 5% of the full b rightness. To perform analog dimming, \nconnect a 50 kΩ variable resistor between LUMA and GND. Alternatively, an external voltage \nor current mode D/A converter may be used to facili tate dimming by sinking a maximum of \n250 µA (for maximum dimming) from LUMA to GND on th e input connector. Open circuit \nvoltage is 4 V nominal. \nThe internal scan frequency can be controlled via t he LUMC and LUMD inputs. When LUMC \nand LUMD are left open, the scan rate is determined  by the SCAN signal (pin 4) on the data \ninput connector. With the combination of LUMC and L UMD, the following and luminance levels \nare obtained: \nTable 5. Luminance control \nApprox. relative luminance 100% 75% 50% 30% 100% 50 % \nLUMD (internal pull up) High High Low Low Open Open  \nLUMC (internal pull up) High Low High Low Open Open  \nSCAN (J1 pin 4) Open Open Open Open High Low \n3.7  Self-test mode \nThe display incorporates a self-test mode composed of two patterns displayed at maximum \nframe rate for approximately 30 seconds each, and t hen repeated. The patterns are as \nfollows: 50/50 Checkerboard and Full On. The self-t est mode is entered by leaving pin 3 on \nJ1 unconnected or pulled high. This pin has an inte rnal pull-up. Connect pin 3 on J1 to ground \nfor normal display operation. \n  \n  Operation Manual  \nEL320.240.36-HB Display  \n \nBeneq Oy    \nOlarinluoma 9  Tel.  +358 9 7599 530  VAT ID FI19563372  \nFI -02200 Espoo  Fax  +358 9 7599 5310  www.beneq.com  \nFinland  lumineq@beneq.com  www.lumineq.com  \n   \nDate: August 10, 2016  Document number: ED000812C  Page | 11  \n \n3.8  Optical \nTable 6.
