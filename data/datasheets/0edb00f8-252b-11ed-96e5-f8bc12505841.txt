Frequency : 28kHz to 40kHz    Time : 5 min max. \n(3) Cleaner \n1. Alcohol type cleaner            2. Aqueous agent \n･Isopropyl alcohol (IPA)             ･PINE ALPHA ST-100S   \n(4) There shall be no residual flux and residual cleaner after cleaning. \n In the case of using aqueous agent, products shall be dried completely after rinse with de-ionized water  \nin order to remove the cleaner. \n(5) Other cleaning \nPlease contact us. \n \n11.8 Resin coating  \nThe inductance value may change due to high cure-stress of  resin to be used for coating/molding products.  \nAn open circuit issue may occur by mechanical stress caused by the resin, amount/cured shape of resin, or operating \ncondition etc. Some resin contains some impurities or chlo ride possible to generate chlorine by hydrolysis under some \noperating condition may cause corrosion of wire of coil, leading to open circuit.  \nSo, please pay your careful attention when you select resin in case of coating/molding the products with the resin. \nPrior to use the coating resin, please make sure no reli ability issue is observed by evaluating products mounted on \nyour board. \n \n11.9 Caution for use   \n・Sharp material such as a pair of tweezers or other material  such as bristles of cleaning brush, shall not be touched  \nto the winding portion to prevent the breaking of wire.  \n・Mechanical shock should not be applied to the pr oducts mounted on the board to prevent the breaking   of  \nthe core \n \n11.10 Handling of a substrate \nAfter mounting products on a substrate, do not apply an y stress to the product caused by bending or twisting  \nto the substrate when cropping the su bstrate, inserting and removing a connec tor from the substrate or tightening \nscrew to the substrate. Excessive mechanical stress may cause cracking in the product. \n \n          B e n d i n g                              T w i s t i n g  \n          \nSeam\nSlitADBC\nb\naLength:a \uf03cb\nScrew Hole  Recommended  \nSpec No. JELF243A-0162A-01                                                                           P . 1 0 / 1 0  \nMURATA MFG.CO., LTD Reference Only  \n11.11 Storage and Handing Requirements  \n(1) Storage period \nUse the products within 12 months after delivered. \nSolderability should be checked if this period is exceeded. \n(2) Storage conditions \n・Products should be stored in the warehouse on the following conditions. \nTemperature :  -10 °C to 40 °C \nHumidity : 15 % to 85 % relative humidity  No rapid change on temperature and humidity  \nThe electrode of the products is coated with solder. Do n\'t keep products in corrosive gases such as sulfur, \nchlorine gas or acid, or it may cause oxidization of electrode, resulting in poor solderability. \n・Products should not be stored on bulk packaging cond ition to prevent the chipping of the core and the  \nbreaking of winding wire caused by the collision between the products. \n・Products should be stored on the palette for the prev ention of the influence from humidity, dust and so on. \n・Products should be stored in the warehouse without heat shock, vibration, direct sunlight and so on. \n(3) Handling Condition \nCare should be taken when transporting or handling produc t to avoid excessive vibration or mechanical shock. \n \n12.
