The device can be easily paralleled to further reduce \nnoise, increase output current and spread heat on a PCB.\nThe LT3093  supplies 200mA  at a typical 190mV  dropout \nvoltage. Operating quiescent current is nominally 2.35mA  \nand drops to 3µA in shutdown. The device ’s wide output \nvoltage range ( 0V to –19.5V ) error amplifier operates in \nunity-gain and provides virtually constant output noise, \nPSRR, bandwidth, and load regulation independent of \nthe programmed output voltage. Additional features are a \nbipolar enable pin, programmable current limit, fast start-\nup capability and programmable power good to indicate \noutput voltage regulation. The regulator incorporates a \ntracking function to control an upstream supply to main -\ntain a constant voltage across the LT3093  to minimize \npower dissipation and optimize PSRR.\nThe LT3093  is stable with a minimum 4.7µF  ceramic out -\nput capacitor . Built-in protection includes internal current \nlimit with foldback and thermal limit with hysteresis. The \nLT3093  is available in thermally enhanced 12-Lead MSOP \nand 3mm  × 3mm  DFN Packages.APPLICATIONS nUltralow RMS Noise : 0.8µV RMS (10Hz  to 100kHz )\n nUltralow Spot Noise : 2.2nV /√Hz at

(Note 3)\nLT3093\n6\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nNote 1 : Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings  \nmay cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to any Absolute \nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device \nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2 : Parasitic diodes exist internally between the EN/UV , I LIM, PG, \nPGFB, SET , GND, VIOC, OUTS and OUT pins and the IN pin. Do not drive \nthese pins more than 0.3V below the IN pin during a fault condition. \nThese pins must remain at a voltage more positive than IN during \nnormal\xa0operation.\nNote 3 : The LT3093  is tested and specified under pulse load conditions \nsuch that T J ≅ TA. The LT3093 E is tested at T A = 25°C and performance \nis guaranteed from 0°C to 125°C. Performance of the LT3093 E over the \nfull –40°C and 125°C operating temperature range is assured by design, \ncharacterization, and correlation with statistical process controls. The \nLT3093 I is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction \ntemperature range. The LT3093 H is 100% tested at the 150°C operating \ntemperature. High junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes. \nOperating lifetime is derated at junction temperatures greater than 125°C.\nNote 4 : SET and OUTS pins are clamped using diodes and two 400Ω  \nseries resistors. For less than 5ms transients, this clamp circuitry can \ncarry more than the rated current.\nNote 5 : Maximum SET and OUTS pin current requirement must \nbe\xa0satisfied.\nNote 6 : Maximum OUT-to-OUTS differential is guaranteed by design.\nNote 7 : Maximum junction temperature limits operating conditions. The \nregulated output voltage specification does not apply for all possible \ncombinations of input voltage and output current, especially due to the \ninternal current limit foldback which starts to decrease current limit at \nVOUT – VIN > 7V. If operating at maximum output current, limit the input \nvoltage range. If operating at maximum input voltage, limit the output \ncurrent range.Note 8 : The EN/UV pin threshold must be met to ensure device operation.\nNote 9 : OUTS ties directly to OUT .\nNote 10 : Dropout voltage is the minimum input-to-output differential \nvoltage needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. The \ndropout voltage is measured when output is 1% out of regulation. This \ndefinition results in a higher dropout voltage compared to hard dropout —\nwhich is measured when V IN = VOUT(NOMINAL) . For output voltages \nbetween 0V and  –1.8V, dropout voltage is limited by the minimum input \nvoltage specification.\nNote 11 : GND pin current is tested with V IN = VOUT(NOMINAL)  and a current \nsource load. Therefore, the device is tested while operating in dropout. \nThis is the worst-case GND pin current. GND pin current decreases at \nhigher input voltages. Note that GND pin current does not include SET pin \nor ILIM pin current, but they are included in quiescent current.\nNote 12 : Adding a capacitor across the SET pin resistor decreases output \nvoltage noise. Adding this capacitor bypasses the SET pin resistor ’s \nthermal noise as well as the reference current ’s noise. The output noise \nthen equals the error amplifier noise. Use of a SET pin bypass capacitor \nalso increases start-up time.\nNote 13 : The current limit programming scale factor is specified while the \ninternal backup current limit is not active. Note that the internal current \nlimit has foldback protection for V OUT – VIN differentials greater than 7V.\nNote 14 : The internal backup current limit circuitry incorporates foldback \nprotection that decreases current limit for V OUT – VIN > 7V. Some level of \noutput current is provided at all V OUT – VIN differential voltages. Consult the \nTypical Performance Characteristics  graph for current limit vs V IN – VOUT.\nNote 15 : The VIOC amplifier outputs a voltage equal to V IN – VOUT or V IN \n+ 1.5V (when V OUT is between 0V and –1.5V). See Block Diagram  and \nApplications Information  for further information.\nNote 16 : For output voltages between 0V and –1.5V, the LT3093  requires \na 10µA  minimum load current for

These pins \nsupply power to the regulator . The LT3093  requires a \nbypass capacitor at the IN pin. In general, a battery ’s \noutput impedance rises with frequency, so include a \nbypass capacitor in battery-powered applications. While \na 4.7µF  input bypass capacitor generally suffices, applica -\ntions with large load transients may require higher input \ncapacitance to prevent input supply droop. Consult the \nApplications Information  section on the proper use of an \ninput capacitor and its effect on circuit performance.\nEN/UV (Pin 3) : Enable/UVLO. Pulling the LT3093 ’s EN/UV \npin low places the part in shutdown. Quiescent current \nin shutdown drops to 3µA and the output voltage turns \noff. Alternatively, the EN/UV pin can set an input supply \nundervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold using a resistor \ndivider between IN, EN/UV and GND. The EN/UV pin is \nbidirectional and can be switched with either a positive \nor negative voltage. The LT3093  typically turns on when \nthe EN/UV voltage exceeds 1.26V  above ground (with \na 200mV  hysteresis on its falling edge) or 1.26V  below \nground (with a 215mV  hysteresis). If unused, tie EN/UV \nto IN. Do not float the EN/UV pin.\nPG (Pin 4) : Power Good. PG is an open-collector flag that \nindicates output voltage regulation. PG pulls low if PGFB \nis between 0V and –300mV . If the power good functional -\nity is not needed, float the PG pin. The PG flag status is \nvalid even if the LT3093  is in shutdown, with the PG pin \nbeing pulled low.\nPGFB (Pin 5) : Power Good Feedback. The PG pin pulls \nhigh if PGFB is below –300mV  on its rising edge, with \n7mV hysteresis on its falling edge. Connecting an external \nresistor divider between OUT , PGFB, and GND sets the \nprogrammable power good threshold with the following \ntransfer function : –0.3V • (1 + R PG1/RPG2) – IPGFB • RPG1. \nAs discussed in the Applications Information  section, \nPGFB also activates the fast start-up circuitry. If power \ngood and fast start-up functionality are not needed, tie \nPGFB to IN. \nILIM (Pin 6) : Current Limit Programming Pin. Connecting a \nresistor between I LIM and GND programs the current limit. \nFor best accuracy, Kelvin connect this resistor directly to \nthe LT3093 ’s GND pin. The programming scale factor is \nnominally 1.95A  • kΩ. If the programmable current limit functionality is not needed, tie I LIM to GND. Do not float \nthe I LIM pin.\nVIOC (Pin 7) : Voltage for Input-to-Output Control. The \nLT3093  incorporates a tracking feature to control a circuit \nsupplying power to the LT3093  to maintain the differen -\ntial voltage across the LT3093 . This function maximizes \nefficiency and PSRR performance while minimizing power \ndissipation. See the Applications Information  section for \nfurther information. If unused, float the VIOC pin.\nSET (Pin 8) : Set. This pin is the inverting input of the \nerror amplifier and the regulation setpoint for the LT3093 . \nThe SET pin sinks a precision 100µA  current that flows \nthrough an external resistor connected between SET and \nGND. The LT3093 ’s output voltage is determined by V SET \n= ISET • RSET. Output voltage range is from zero to –19.5V . \nAdding a capacitor from SET to GND improves noise, \nPSRR, and transient response at the expense of increased \nstart-up time unless the fast start-up capability is used via \nthe PGFB pin. For optimum load regulation, Kelvin con -\nnect the ground side of the SET pin directly to the load.\nGND (Pin 9) : Ground.\nOUTS (Pin 10) : Output Sense. This pin is the noninvert -\ning input to the error amplifier . For optimal transient \nperformance and load regulation, Kelvin connect OUTS \ndirectly to the output capacitor and the load. Also, tie the \nGND connections of the output capacitor and the SET pin \ncapacitor directly together . Exercise care with regards to \nplacement of input capacitors relative to output capacitors \ndue to potential PSRR degradation from magnetic cou -\npling effects ; see the Applications Information  section for \nfurther information on capacitor placement and board lay -\nout.

This pin supplies power to the \nload. For stability, use a minimum 4.7µF  output capacitor \nwith an ESR below 30mΩ  and an ESL below 1.5nH .

Designed \nas a precision current reference followed by a high perfor -\nmance rail-to-rail voltage buffer , the LT3093  can be easily \nparalleled to further reduce noise, increase output current \nand spread heat on the PCB. The device additionally fea -\ntures programmable current limit, fast start-up capability \nand programmable power good.\nThe LT3093  is easy to use and incorporates all of the \nprotection features expected in high performance regula -\ntors. Included are short-circuit protection, safe operating \narea protection, and thermal shutdown with hysteresis.\nOutput Voltage\nThe LT3093  incorporates a precision 100µA  current refer -\nence flowing into the SET pin, which also ties to the error \namplifier ’s inverting input. Figure 1  illustrates that con -\nnecting a resistor from SET to ground generates a refer -\nence voltage for the error amplifier . This reference voltage \nis simply the product of the SET pin current and the SET \npin resistor . The error amplifier ’s unity-gain configuration \nproduces a low impedance version of this voltage on its \nnoninverting input, i.e. the OUTS pin, which is externally \ntied to the OUT pin. The LT3093 \'s output voltage is deter -\nmined by V SET = ISET • RSET.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe LT3093 ’s rail-to-rail error amplifier and current refer -\nence architecture allows for a wide output voltage range \nfrom 0V (using a 0Ω resistor) to V IN minus dropout. An \nNPN-based input pair is active for a 0V to –0.8V output \nand a PNP-based input pair is active for output voltages \nbeyond –1.5V, with a smooth transition between the two \ninput pairs from –0.8V to –1.5V output. The PNP-based \ninput pair offers the best overall performance ; refer to \nthe Electrical Characteristics  table for details on offset \nvoltage, SET pin current, output noise and PSRR varia -\ntion depending on the output voltage and corresponding \nactive input pair(s). Table 1  lists common output voltages \nand their corresponding 1% R SET resistors.\nTable 1. 1% Resistor for Common Output Voltages\nVOUT (V) RSET (kΩ)\n–2.5 24.9\n–3.3 33.2\n–5 49.9\n–12 121\n–15 150\nThe benefit of using a current reference compared with \na voltage reference as used in conventional regulators is \nthat the regulator always operates in a unity-gain con -\nfiguration, independent of the programmed output volt -\nage. This allows the LT3093  to have loop gain, frequency \nresponse and bandwidth independent of the output volt -\nage. As a result, noise, PSRR and transient performance \ndo not change with output voltage. Moreover , since error \namplifier gain is not needed to amplify the SET pin voltage \nto a higher output voltage, output load regulation is more \ntightly specified in the hundreds of microvolts range and \nnot as a fixed percentage of the output voltage.\nSince the zero TC current reference is highly accurate, \nthe SET pin resistor can become the limiting factor in \nachieving high accuracy. Hence, it should be a precision \nresistor . Additionally, any leakage paths to or from the \nSET pin create errors in the output voltage. If necessary, \nuse high quality insulation (e.g. Teflon, Kel-F) ; moreover , \ncleaning of all insulating surfaces to remove fluxes and \nother residues may be required.

Guarding both sides of the circuit board is \nrecommended. Bulk leakage reduction depends on the \nguard ring width. Leakage of 100nA  into or out of the \nSET pin creates a 0.1% error in the reference voltage. \nLeakages of this magnitude, coupled with other sources \nof leakage, can cause significant errors in the output volt -\nage, especially over wide operating temperature ranges. \nFigure 2  illustrates a typical guard ring layout technique.to avoid adding extra impedance (ESR and ESL) outside \nthe feedback loop. To that end, minimize the effects of \nPCB trace and solder inductance by tying the OUTS pin \ndirectly to C OUT and the GND side of C SET directly to the \nGND side of C OUT, as well as keep the GND sides of C IN \nand C OUT reasonably close, as shown in Figure 3 . Refer \nto the LT3093  demo board manual for more information \non the recommended layout that meets these require -\nments. While the LT3093  is robust and will not oscillate \nif the recommended layout is not followed, depending \non the actual layout, phase/gain margin, noise and PSRR \nperformance may degrade.\nFigure 2. DFN Guard Ring Layout\nFigure 3. COUT and C SET Connections for Best Performance3093 F0213OUT\nSET12\n11\n8910\n4\n5321\n7 6\nSince the SET pin is a high impedance node, unwanted \nsignals may couple into the SET pin and cause erratic \nbehavior . This is most noticeable when operating with \na minimum output capacitor at heavy load currents. \nBypassing the SET pin with a small capacitance to ground \nresolves this issue —10nF  is sufficient.\nFor applications requiring higher accuracy or an adjust -\nable output voltage, the SET pin may be actively driven \nby an external voltage source capable of sourcing 100µA . \nConnecting a precision voltage reference to the SET pin \neliminates any errors present in the output voltage due \nto the reference current and SET pin resistor tolerances.\nOutput Sensing and Stability\nThe LT3093 ’s OUTS pin provides a Kelvin sense connec -\ntion to the output. The SET pin resistor ’s GND side pro -\nvides a Kelvin sense connection to the load ’s GND side.\nAdditionally, for ultrahigh PSRR, the LT3093  bandwidth \nis made quite high ( ~1MHz ), making it very close to a \ntypical 4.7µF  (1206 case size) ceramic output capacitor ’s \nself-resonance frequency ( ~2.3MHz ). It is very important Stability and Output Capacitance\nThe LT3093  requires an output capacitor for stability. \nGiven its high bandwidth, ADI recommends low ESR and \nESL ceramic capacitors. A minimum 4.7µF  output capaci -\ntance with an ESR below 30mΩ  and an ESL below 1.5nH  \nis required for stability. \nGiven the high PSRR and low noise performance attained \nwith using a single 4.7µF  ceramic output capacitor , larger \nvalues of output capacitor only marginally improve the \nperformance because the regulator bandwidth decreases \nwith increasing output capacitance —hence, there is little \nto be gained by using larger than the minimum 4.7µF  out-\nput capacitor .

Note that bypass capacitors used to decouple \nindividual components powered by the LT3093  increase \nthe effective output capacitance.\nGive extra consideration to the type of ceramic capaci -\ntors used. They are manufactured with a variety of dielec -\ntrics, each with different behavior across temperature and \napplied voltage. The most common dielectrics used are \nspecified with EIA temperature characteristic codes of \nZ5U, Y5V , X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics are \ngood for providing high capacitance in small packages, \nbut they tend to have stronger voltage and temperature \ncoefficients as shown in Figure 4  and Figure 5 . When \nused with a 5V regulator , a 16V 10µF  Y5V capacitor can \nexhibit an effective value as low as 1µF to 2µF for the DC \nbias voltage applied over the operating temperature range.\nThe X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable char -\nacteristics and are thus more suitable for use with the \nLT3093 . The X7R dielectric has better stability across \ntemperature, while the X5R is less expensive and is \navailable in higher values. Nonetheless, care must still \nbe exercised when using X5R and X7R capacitors. The \nX5R and X7R codes only specify operating temperature \nrange and the maximum capacitance change over tem -\nperature. While capacitance change due to DC bias for \nX5R and X7R is better than Y5V and Z5U dielectrics, it \ncan still be significant enough to drop capacitance below \nsufficient levels. As shown in Figure 6 , capacitor DC bias \ncharacteristics tend to improve as component case size \nincreases, but verification of expected capacitance at \nthe operating voltage is highly recommended.\nHigh Vibration Environments\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress \nupon it, similar to how a piezoelectric microphone works. \nFor a ceramic capacitor , this stress can be induced by \nmechanical vibrations within the system or due to thermal \ntransients.\nLT3093  applications in high vibration environments have \nthree distinct piezoelectric noise generators : ceramic APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 4.

However , due to \nthe LT3093 ’s very low output impedance over a wide \nfrequency range, negligible output noise is generated \nusing a ceramic output capacitor . Similarly, due to the \nLT3093 ’s ultrahigh PSRR, negligible output noise is gen -\nerated using a ceramic input capacitor . Given the high \nSET pin impedance, any piezoelectric response from a \nceramic SET pin capacitor generates significant output \nnoise ; peak-to-peak excursions of hundreds of µVs are \npossible. However , due to the SET pin capacitor ’s high \nESR and ESL tolerance, any non-piezoelectrically respon -\nsive (tantalum, electrolytic, or film) capacitor can be used \nat the SET pin ; do note that electrolytic capacitors tend \nto have high 1/f noise. In any case, use of surface mount \ncapacitors is highly recommended.\nStability and Input Capacitance\nThe LT3093  is stable with a minimum 4.7µF  IN pin capaci -\ntor . ADI recommends using low ESR ceramic capacitors. \nApplications using long wires to connect the power supply \nto the LT3093 ’s input and ground terminals together with \nlow ESR ceramic input capacitors are prone to voltage \nspikes, reliability concerns and application-specific board \noscillations. The wire inductance combined with the low \nESR ceramic input capacitor forms a high Q resonant LC \ntank circuit. In some instances, this resonant frequency \nbeats against the output current LDO bandwidth and inter -\nferes with stable operation. The resonant LC tank circuit \nformed by the wire inductance and input capacitor is the \ncause and not because of LT3093 ’s instability.\nThe self inductance, or isolated inductance, of a wire \nis directly proportional to its length. The wire diameter , \nhowever , has less influence on its self inductance. For \nexample, the self inductance of a 2-AWG isolated wire \nwith a diameter of 0.26 ” is about half the inductance \nof a 30-AWG wire with a diameter of 0.01 ”. One foot of \n30-AWG wire has 465nH  of self inductance.\nSeveral methods exist to reduce a wire ’s self inductance. \nOne method divides the current flowing towards the \nLT3093  between two parallel conductors. In this case, \nplacing wire further apart reduces the inductance ; up to \na 50% reduction when placed only a few inches apart. \nSplitting the wires connects two equal inductors in parallel. \nHowever , when placed in close proximity to each other , their mutual inductance adds to the overall self inductance of the \nwires —therefore a 50% reduction is not possible in such \ncases. The second and more effective technique to reduce \nthe overall inductance is to place the forward and return \ncurrent conductors (the input and ground wires) in close \nproximity. T wo 30-AWG wires separated by 0.02 ” reduce \nthe overall inductance to about one-fifth of a single wire.\nIf a battery mounted in close proximity powers the LT3093 , \na 4.7µF  input capacitor suffices for stability. If a distantly \nlocated supply powers the LT3093 , use a larger value input \ncapacitor . Use a rough guideline of 1µF (in addition to the \n4.7µF  minimum) per 6 ” of wire length. The minimum input \ncapacitance needed to stabilize the application also varies \nwith the output capacitance as well as the load current. \nPlacing additional capacitance on the LT3093 ’s output \nhelps. However , this requires significantly more capaci -\ntance compared to additional input bypassing. Series \nresistance between the supply and the LT3093  input also \nhelps stabilize the application ; as little as 0.1Ω  to 0.5Ω  \nsuffices. This impedance dampens the LC tank circuit at \nthe expense of dropout voltage. A better alternative is to \nuse a higher ESR tantalum or electrolytic capacitor at the \nLT3093  input in parallel with a 4.7µF  ceramic capacitor .\nPSRR and Input Capacitance\nFor applications utilizing the LT3093  for post-regulating \nswitching converters, placing a capacitor directly at the \nLT3093  input results in AC current (at the switching fre -\nquency) to flow near the LT3093 . This relatively high fre -\nquency switching current generates magnetic fields that \ncouple to the LT3093  output, degrading the effective PSRR. \nWhile highly dependent on the PCB layout, the switching \npreregulator , the size of the input capacitor and other fac -\ntors, the PSRR degradation can easily be over 30dB  at \n1MHz . This degradation is present even with the LT3093  \ndesoldered from the board, it is a degradation in the PSRR \nof the PCB itself. While negligible for conventional low \nPSRR LDOs, the LT3093 ’s ultrahigh PSRR requires careful \nattention to higher order parasitics in order to realize the \nfull performance offered by the regulator .\nTo mitigate the flow of high frequency switching cur -\nrent near the LT3093 , the input capacitor can be entirely \nremoved as long as the switching converter ’s out -\nput capacitor is located more than an inch away from APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3093\n21\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comthe LT3093 . Magnetic coupling decreases rapidly with \nincreasing distance. If the switching regulator is placed \ntoo far away (conservatively more than a couple inches) \nfrom the LT3093 , the lack of an input capacitor presents a \nhigh impedance at the input of the LT3093  and oscillation \nmay occur . It is generally a common (and preferred) prac -\ntice to bypass regulator inputs with some capacitance, so \nthis option is fairly limited in its scope and not the most \npalatable solution.\nTo that end, ADI recommends referencing the LT3093  \ndemo board layout for achieving the best possible PSRR \nperformance. T wo main factors contribute to higher PSRR \nwith a poor layout. Parasitic trace inductance coupled with \nthe low ESR ceramic input capacitor can lead to higher \nripple at the input of the LDO than at the output of the \ndriving supply. Also, physical loops create magnetic fields \nthat couple from the input to the output. The LT3093  \ndemo board utilizes layout techniques to minimize both \nparasitic inductance in traces and coupling of magnetic \nloops, preventing PSRR degradation while keeping the \ninput capacitor .\nFiltering High Frequency Spikes\nFor applications where the LT3093  is used to post-regu -\nlate a switching converter , its high PSRR effectively sup -\npresses any harmonic content present at the switching \nfrequency (typically 100kHz  to 4MHz ). However , there are \nvery high frequency (hundreds of MHz) spikes associated \nwith the switcher ’s power switch transition times that are \nbeyond the LT3093 ’s bandwidth and will almost directly \npass through to the output. While the output capacitor is \npartly intended to absorb these spikes, its ESL will limit \nits ability at these frequencies. A ferrite bead or even the \ninductance associated with a short (e.g. 0.5 ”) PCB trace \ncoupled with a capacitor with a low impedance at the \ntransition frequency can serve as an LC-filter to suppress \nthese very high frequency spikes.\nOutput Noise\nThe LT3093  offers many advantages with respect to noise \nperformance. T raditional linear regulators have several \nsources of noise. The most critical noise sources for a tra -\nditional regulator are its voltage reference, error amplifier , \nnoise from the resistor divider network used for setting output voltage and the noise gain created by this resistor \ndivider . Many low noise regulators pin out their voltage \nreference to allow for noise reduction by bypassing the \nreference voltage.\nUnlike most linear regulators, the LT3093  does not use a \nvoltage reference ; instead it uses a 100µA  current refer -\nence. The current reference operates with typical noise \ncurrent level of 27pA /√Hz (8nA RMS over the 10Hz  to \n100kHz  bandwidth). The resultant voltage noise equals \nthe current noise multiplied by the resistor values, which \nis then RMS summed with the error amplifier ’s noise and \nthe resistor ’s Johnson noise of √4kTR  (k = Boltzmann ’s \nconstant, 1.38 • 10–23 J/K, and T is absolute temperature) \nto give the net output noise.\nOne problem faced by conventional linear regulators is \nthat the resistor divider setting the output voltage gains up \nthe reference noise. In contrast, the LT3093 ’s unity-gain \nfollower architecture presents no gain from the SET pin \nto the output. Therefore, using a capacitor to bypass the \nSET pin resistor allows output voltage noise to be inde -\npendent of the programmed output voltage. The resultant \noutput noise is then determined only by the error ampli -\nfier’s noise, typically 2nV/√Hz from 1kHz  to 1MHz  and \n0.8µV RMS in the 10Hz  to 100kHz  bandwidth when using \na 4.7µF  SET pin capacitor . Paralleling multiple LT3093 s \nfurther reduces noise by √N for N parallel regulators.\nRefer to the Typical Performance Characteristics  sec-\ntion for noise spectral density and RMS integrated \nnoise performance over various load currents and SET \npin\xa0capacitances.\nSET Pin (Bypass) Capacitance : Noise, PSRR, \nT ransient Response and Soft-Start\nIn addition to reducing output noise, using a SET pin \nbypass capacitor also improves PSRR and transient per -\nformance. Note that any bypass capacitor leakage deterio -\nrates the LT3093 ’s DC regulation. Capacitor leakage of as \nlittle as 100nA  causes a 0.1% DC error . ADI recommends \nthe use of a good quality low leakage ceramic capacitor .\nUsing a SET pin bypass capacitor also soft starts the \noutput and limits inrush current. The RC time constant \nformed by the SET pin resistor and capacitor determines APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3093\n22\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comsoft-start time. Without the use of fast start-up, the ramp-\nup rate from 0 to 90% of nominal V OUT is:\n tSS ≈ 2.3 • RSET • CSET (Fast Start-Up Disabled)\nFast Start-Up\nFor ultralow noise applications that require low 1/f noise \n(i.e. at frequencies below 100Hz ) a larger value SET pin \ncapacitor is required ; up to 22µF  may be used. While \nnormally this would significantly increase the regulator ’s \nstart-up time, the LT3093  incorporates fast start-up cir -\ncuitry that increases the SET pin current to about 1.8mA  \nduring start-up.\nAs shown in the Block Diagram , the 1.8mA  current source \nremains engaged while PGFB is less than –300mV  unless \nthe regulator is in current limit, dropout, thermal shut -\ndown, or input voltage is below the minimum V IN.\nIf fast start-up capability is not used, tie PGFB to IN or to \nOUT (for output voltages more than –300mV ). Note that \ndoing so also disables power good functionality.\nENABLE/UVLO\nThe EN/UV pin is used to put the regulator into a micro -\npower shutdown state. The LT3093  has an accurate \n–1.26V  turn-on threshold on the EN/UV pin with 215mV  \nof hysteresis. This threshold can be used in conjunction \nwith a resistor divider from the input supply to define \nan accurate undervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold for \nthe regulator . The EN/UV pin current (I EN) at the thresh -\nold needs to be considered when calculating the resistor \ndivider network. See the Electrical Characteristics  table \nand Typical Performance curves for EN/UV pin charac -\nteristics. The EN/UV pin current can be ignored if RE N1 \nis less than 100k . Use the following formula to determine \nresistor divider values (See Programming Undervoltage \nLockout in the Typical Application  section) :\n V IN(UVLO)  = –1.26V  • (1 + R EN2 / REN1) – IEN • REN2\nSince the EN/UV pin is bidirectional, it can also be pulled \nabove 1.26V  to turn on the LT3093 . In bipolar supply \napplications, the positive EN/UV threshold can be used \nto sequence the turn-on of the LT3093  after the positive \nregulator has turned on. If unused, tie the EN/UV pin to IN.High Efficiency Linear Regulator —Input-to-Output \nVoltage Control\nThe VIOC pin is used to control an upstream switch -\ning converter and facilitate a design solution that maxi -\nmizes system efficiency while providing good transient \nresponse, low noise, and high power supply ripple rejec -\ntion (PSRR) by maintaining a constant voltage across the \nLT3093  regardless of the device ’s output voltage. This \nworks well in applications where the output voltage is \nvaried for the application requirements. This regulation \nloop also minimizes total power dissipation in fault con -\nditions ; if the output is short-circuited and the LT3093  \ncurrent limits, the VIOC amplifier lowers the switching \nregulator output voltage and limits the power dissipation \nin the LT3093 .\nThe VIOC pin is the output of a fast unity-gain amplifier \nthat measures the voltage differential between IN and \nOUTS or –1.5V, whichever is lower . It typically connects to \nthe feedback node or into the resistor divider of most L TC® \nswitching regulators or L TM® power modules and sinks \nat least 100µA  of current. Targeting –1V differential from \ninput-to-output provides an optimum tradeoff in terms \nof power dissipation and PSRR. The maximum output \nswing of the VIOC amplifier is limited only by the input \nvoltage ; it will provide an output all the way to maximum \nVIN. If paralleling multiple LT3093 ’s, tie the VIOC pin of \none of the devices to the upstream switching converter ’s \nfeedback pin and float the remaining VIOC pins.\nThe VIOC amplifier is designed to sink current, and only \nsources current through its internal impedance to ground. \nThe VIOC pin has a typical impedance to ground of 120k  \n±15%, this is important to consider if using a maximum \ninput voltage configuration or if the LT3093  is disabled.\nAs the VIOC buffer operates with high bandwidth, the \nswitching converter ’s frequency compensation doesn ’t \nneed to be adjusted while the VIOC buffer is inside the \nswitching converter ’s feedback loop. Phase delay through \nthe VIOC buffer is typically less than 4° for frequencies as \nhigh as 100kHz ; within the switching converter ’s band -\nwidth (usually well below 100kHz ) the VIOC buffer is \ntransparent and acts like an ideal wire. For example, with \na switching converter with less than 100kHz  bandwidth \nand a phase margin of 50°, using the VIOC buffer will APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3093\n23\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comFigure 8.

For V OUT \n≤ –1.5V, VIN = VOUT + V VIOC(NOM) . The VIOC pin voltage \n(and the input-to-output differential) is programmable to \nanywhere between –0.33V  (the dropout voltage of the \nregulator) and the input voltage.

The PGFB pin current (I PGFB) can \nbe ignored if R PG2 is less than 30k, otherwise it must \nbe considered when determining the resistor divider net -\nwork. If power good functionality is not used, float the \nPG pin. Please note that programmable power good and \nfast start-up capabilities are disabled for output voltages \nbetween OV and –300mV . \nTake care when laying out traces for PG and PGFB on a \nPCB. If the PG and PGFB pins are run close to each other \nfor a distance (typically greater than two inches), stray \ncapacitance from trace-to-trace couples the PG signal \ninto the high impedance PGFB signal. Since PG is out \nof phase relative to PGFB, this results in oscillation. To \navoid this, minimize the distance the two traces run close \nto each other ; lowering the impedance seen at the PGFB \npin by using lower value resistors for the PGFB divider \nalso helps.\nExternally Programmable Current Limit\nThe I LIM pin internally regulates to –300mV . Connecting a \nresistor from ground to I LIM sets the current flowing into \nthe I LIM pin, which in turn programs the LT3093 ’s current \nlimit. With the 1.95kΩ  • A programming scale factor , the \ncurrent limit can be calculated as follows :\n Current Limit = 1.95kΩ  • A / R ILIM\nFor example, a 9.76k  resistor programs the current limit \nto 200mA  and a 15k resistor programs the current limit \nto 130mA . For good accuracy, Kelvin connect this resistor \nto the LT3093 ’s GND pin.\nIn cases where the IN-to-OUT differential is greater than \n7V, the LT3093 ’s foldback circuitry decreases the inter -\nnal current limit. As a result, the internal current limit \nmay override the externally programmed current limit to keep the LT3093  within its safe-operating-area (SOA). \nSee the graph of Internal Current Limit vs Input-to-Output \nDifferential in the Typical Performance Characteristics  \nsection. If not used, tie I LIM to GND.\nOutput Overshoot Recovery\nDuring a load step from heavy load to very light or no \nload, the output voltage overshoots before the regula -\ntor responds to turn the power transistor off. With very \nlight or no load, it takes a long time to discharge the \noutput\xa0capacitor .\nThe LT3093  incorporates an overshoot recovery circuit \nthat turns on a current source to discharge the capacitor \nin the event that OUTS is higher than SET . This current is \ntypically 1.8mA .\nIf OUTS is externally held above SET , the current source \nturns on in an attempt to restore OUTS to its programmed \nvoltage. The current source remains on until the external \ncircuitry releases OUTS.\nDirect Paralleling for Higher Current\nHigher output current is obtained by paralleling multiple \nLT3093 s. Tie all SET pins together and all IN pins together . \nConnect the OUT pins together using small pieces of PCB \ntrace (used as a ballast resistor) to equalize currents in \nthe LT3093 s.

Figure 16  shows a recommended layout that \ndelivers full performance of the regulator . Refer to the \nLT3093 ’s DC2952 A demo board manual for further details.\nThermal Considerations\nThe LT3093  has internal power and thermal limiting cir -\ncuits that protect the device under overload conditions. The thermal shutdown temperature is nominally 167°C \nwith about 8°C of hysteresis. For continuous normal load \nconditions, do not exceed the maximum junction temper -\nature ( 125°C for E- and I-grades, 150°C for H-grade). It \nis important to consider all sources of thermal resistance \nfrom junction to ambient. This includes junction-to-case, \ncase-to-heat sink interface, heat sink resistance or circuit \nboard-to-ambient as the application dictates. Additionally, \nconsider all heat sources in close proximity to the LT3093 .\nThe undersides of the DFN and MSOP packages have \nexposed metal from the lead frame to the die attachment. \nBoth packages allow heat to directly transfer from the die \njunction to the PCB metal to limit maximum operating \njunction temperature.

Therefore, the junction temperature rise above ambi -\nent approximately equals :\n 0.42W  • 35°C/W = 14.7°C\nThe maximum junction temperature equals the maximum \nambient temperature plus the maximum junction tem -\nperature rise above ambient :\n T J(MAX)  = 85°C + 14. 7°C = 99.7°C\nOverload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the LT3093  incorporates \nsafe-operating-area (SOA) protection. The SOA protection \nactivates at input-to-output differential voltages greater \nthan 7V. The SOA protection decreases the current limit as the input-to-output differential increases and keeps \nthe power transistor inside a safe operating region for \nall values of input-to-output voltages up to the LT3093 ’s \nabsolute maximum ratings. The LT3093  provides some \nlevel of output current for all values of input-to-output \ndifferential voltage. Refer to the Current Limit curves in \nthe Typical Performance Characteristics  section. When \npower is first applied and input voltage rises, the output \nfollows the input and keeps the input-to-output differential \nlow to allow the regulator to supply large output current \nand start-up into high current loads.\nDue to current limit foldback, however , at high input volt -\nages a problem can occur if the output voltage is low and \nthe load current is high. Such situations occur after the \nremoval of a short-circuit or if the EN/UV pin is pulled high \nafter the input voltage has already turned on. The load line \nin such cases intersects the output current profile at two \npoints. The regulator now has two stable operating points. \nWith this double intersection, the input power supply may \nneed to be cycled down to zero and brought back up again \nto make the output recover . Other linear regulators with \nfoldback current limit protection (such as the LT3090 , \nLT1964  and LT1175 ) also exhibit this phenomenon, so it \nis not unique to the LT3093 .\nProtection Features\nThe LT3093  incorporates several protection features for \nsensitive applications. Precision current limit and ther -\nmal overload protection safeguard the LT3093  against \noverload and fault conditions at the device ’s output. For \nnormal operation, do not allow the junction temperature \nto exceed 125°C (E- and I-grades) or 150°C (H-grade).\nPulling the LT3093 ’s output above ground induces no \ndamage to the part. If IN is left open circuit or grounded, \nOUT can be pulled 20V above GND. In this condition, a \nmaximum current of 25mA  flows into the OUT pin and out \nof the GND pin. If IN is powered by a voltage source, OUT \nsinks the LT3093 ’s (foldback) short circuit current and \nprotects itself by thermal limiting. In this case, however , \ngrounding the EN/UV pin turns off the device and stops \nOUT from sinking the short-circuit current.\nLT3093\n29\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comTYPICAL APPLICATION\nProgramming Undervoltage Lookout\nL T3093SET GND\n3093 TA02–+\n100µAILIMOUTS\nOUT4.7µF\n4.7µF33.2k\nPINS NOT USED IN THIS CIRCUIT : PG, VIOCVOUT\n–3.3V\nIOUT(MAX)\n200mA\nINPGFB\nVIN\n–4V TURN-ON\n–3.35V TURN-OFFEN/UV4.7µF9.76k\nREN1\n49.9k\nREN2\n110k VIN(UVLO)RISING = –1.26V • 1\n110k\n49.9k£\n¤²¥\n¦´ \nLT3093\n30\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comPACKAGE DESCRIPTION\n3.00 ±0.10\n(4 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
