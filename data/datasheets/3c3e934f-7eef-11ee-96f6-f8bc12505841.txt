#### Description:
The **SN74LV21A** is a dual 4-input positive-AND gate designed for operation within a voltage range of 2 V to 5.5 V. It performs the Boolean function Y = A • B • C • D in positive logic. This component is particularly suited for applications requiring low power consumption and high-speed operation, with a maximum propagation delay (t pd) of 6 ns at 5 V.

#### Typical Applications:
The SN74LV21A is commonly used in:
- **Digital Logic Circuits:** As a building block for implementing complex logic functions.
- **Signal Processing:** In applications where multiple input signals need to be combined logically.
- **Data Routing:** In systems where data needs to be directed based on multiple conditions.
- **Power Management:** In circuits that require control signals based on multiple input conditions.

This component is ideal for use in consumer electronics, automotive applications, and any digital systems requiring reliable logic operations with low power consumption.
