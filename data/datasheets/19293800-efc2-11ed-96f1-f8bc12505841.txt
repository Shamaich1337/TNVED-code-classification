Low-Power, 2-Wire, Serial \nVoltage-Output DAC\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 7Detailed Description\nThe MAX5812 is a 12-bit, voltage-output DAC with an\nI2C/SMBus-compatible 2-wire interface. The device con-\nsists of a serial interface, power-down circuitry, inputand DAC registers, a 12-bit resistor string DAC, unity-gain output buffer, and output resistor network. The seri-al interface decodes the address and control bits,routing the data to either the input or DAC register. Datacan be directly written to the DAC register immediatelyupdating the device output, or can be written to theinput register without changing the DAC output. Bothregisters retain data as long as the device is powered.\nDAC Operation\nThe MAX5812 uses a segmented resistor string DACarchitecture, which saves power in the overall systemand guarantees output monotonicity. The MAX5812 ’s\ninput coding is straight binary with the output voltagegiven by the following equation:\nwhere N = 12(bits), and D = the decimal value of the\ninput code (0 to 4095).\nOutput Buffer\nThe MAX5812 analog output is buffered by a precisionunity-gain follower that slews 0.5V/µs. The buffer outputswings rail-to-rail and is capable of driving 5k Ωin paral-\nlel with 200pF. The output settles to ±0.5LSB within 4µs.\nPower-On Reset\nThe MAX5812 features an internal power-on-reset(POR) circuit that initializes the device upon power-up.The DAC registers are set to zero-scale and the deviceis powered down with the output buffer disabled andthe output pulled to GND through the 100k Ωtermina-\ntion resistor. Following power-up, a wake-up commandmust be initiated before conversions are performed.\nPower-Down Modes\nThe MAX5812 has three software-controlled, low-power, power-down modes. All three modes disablethe output buffer and disconnect the DAC resistorstring from V\nDD, reducing supply current draw to\n300nA. In power-down mode 0, the device output ishigh impedance. In power-down mode 1, the deviceoutput is internally pulled to GND by a 1k Ωtermination\nresistor. In power-down mode 2, the device output isinternally pulled to GND by a 100k Ωtermination resis-\ntor. Table 1 shows the power-down mode commandwords.\nUpon wake-up, the DAC output is restored to its previ-\nous value. Data is retained in the input and DAC regis-ters during power-down mode.\nDigital Interface \nThe MAX5812 features an I2C/SMBus-compatible\n2-wire interface consisting of a serial data line (SDA)VVD\nOUTREF\nN=×()\n2Pin Description\nPIN NAME FUNCTION\n1V DD Power Supply and DAC Reference Input\n2 GND Ground\n3 SDA Bidirectional Serial Data I/O\n4 SCL Serial Clock Line\n5 ADD Address Select.

The MAX5812 is SMBus\ncompatible within the range of V DD= 2.7V to 3.6V. SDA\nand SCL facilitate bidirectional communication betweenthe MAX5812 and the master at rates up to 400kHz.Figure 1 shows the 2-wire interface timing diagram. TheMAX5812 is a transmit/receive slave-only device, rely-ing upon a master to generate a clock signal. The mas-ter, typically a microcontroller, initiates data transfer onthe bus and generates SCL to permit that transfer.\nA master device communicates to the MAX5812 by\ntransmitting the proper address followed by commandand/or data words. Each transmit sequence is framedby a START (S) or REPEATED START (S\nr) condition and\na STOP (P) condition. Each word transmitted over thebus is 8 bits long and is always followed by anacknowledge clock pulse.\nThe MAX5812 SDA and SCL drivers are open-drain out-\nputs, requiring a pullup resistor (500 Ωor greater) to\ngenerate a logic high voltage (see the Typical Operating\nCircuit ). Series resistors R\nSare optional. These series\nresistors protect the input stages of the MAX5812 fromhigh-voltage spikes on the bus lines and minimizecrosstalk and undershoot of the bus signals.\nBit Transfer\nOne data bit is transferred during each SCL clockcycle. The data on SDA must remain stable during thehigh period of the SCL clock pulse. Changes in SDAwhile the SCL is high are control signals (see theSTART and STOP Conditions section). SDA and SCL\nidle high when the I\n2C bus is not busy.\nSTART and STOP Conditions\nWhen the serial interface is inactive, SDA and SCL idlehigh. A master device initiates communication by issu-ing a START condition. A START condition is a high-to-Figure 1.

A STOP condition\nis a low-to-high transition on SDA while SCL is high(Figure 2). A START condition from the master signalsthe beginning of a transmission to the MAX5812. Themaster terminates transmission by issuing a notacknowledge followed by a STOP condition (see theAcknowledge Bit section). The STOP condition frees the\nbus. If a repeated START condition (S\nr) is generated\ninstead of a STOP condition, the bus remains active.When a STOP condition or incorrect address is detect-ed, the MAX5812 internally disconnects SCL from theserial interface until the next START condition, minimiz-ing digital noise and feedthrough.\nEarly STOP Conditions\nThe MAX5812 recognizes a STOP condition at any pointduring transmission except when a STOP conditionoccurs in the same high pulse as a START condition(Figure 3). This condition is not a legal I\n2C format, at\nleast one clock pulse must separate any START andSTOP conditions.\nRepeated START Conditions\nA repeated start (S\nr) condition might indicate a change\nof data direction on the bus. Such a change occurswhen a command word is required to initiate a readoperation. S\nralso can be used when the bus master is\nwriting to several I2C devices and does not want to\nrelinquish control of the bus. The MAX5812 serial inter-face supports continuous write operations with or with-out an S\nrcondition separating them. Continuous read\noperations require S rconditions because of the change\nin direction of data flow.\nAcknowledge Bit (ACK)\nThe acknowledge bit (ACK) is the ninth bit attached toany 8-bit data word. ACK is always generated by thereceiving device. The MAX5812 generates an ACKwhen receiving an address or data by pulling SDA lowduring the ninth clock period. When transmitting data,the MAX5812 waits for the receiving device to generatean ACK. Monitoring ACK allows detection of unsuc-cessful data transfers. An unsuccessful data transferoccurs if a receiving device is busy or if a system faulthas occurred. In the event of an unsuccessful datatransfer, the bus master should reattempt communica-tion at a later time.\nSlave Address\nA bus master initiates communication with a slavedevice by issuing a START condition followed by the 7-bit slave address (Figure 4). When idle, the MAX5812waits for a START condition followed by its slaveaddress. The serial interface compares each addressvalue bit-by-bit, allowing the interface to power-down\nimmediately when an incorrect address is detected.The LSB of the address word is the Read /Write (R/W)\nbit. R/ Windicates whether the master is writing to or\nreading from the MAX5812 (R/ W= 0 selects the write\ncondition, R/ W= 1 selects the read condition). After\nreceiving the proper address, the MAX5812 issues anACK by pulling SDA low for one clock cycle.\nThe MAX5812 has eight factory/user-programmed\naddresses (Table 2). Address bits A6 through A1 arepreset; A0 is controlled by ADD. Connecting ADD toGND sets A0 = 0. Connecting ADD to V\nDDsets A0 = 1.\nThis feature allows up to eight MAX5812s to share a bus.\nWrite Data Format\nIn write mode (R/ W= 0), data that follows the address\nbyte controls the MAX5812 (Figure 5). Bits C3 –C0 con-\nfigure the MAX5812 (Table 3). Bits D11 –D0 are DAC\ndata. Input and DAC registers update on the fallingedge of SCL during the acknowledge bit. Should thewrite cycle be prematurely aborted, data will not beupdated and the write cycle must be repeated. Figure6 shows two example write data sequences. S A 6A 5A 4A 3A 2A 1A 0 R / W\nFigure 4.

Figure 7 shows an example-read data sequence.\nI\n2C Compatibility\nThe MAX5812 is compatible with existing I2C systems.\nSCL and SDA are high-impedance inputs; SDA has anopen drain that pulls the data line low during the ninthclock pulse. The Typical Operating Circuit shows a typ-\nical I\n2C application. The communication protocol sup-\nports standard I2C 8-bit communications. The general\ncall address is ignored. The MAX5812 address is com-patible only with the 7-bit I2C addressing protocol. Ten-\nbit address formats are not supported. \nDigital Feedthrough Suppression\nWhen the MAX5812 detects an address mismatch, theserial interface disconnects the SCL signal from thecore circuitry. This minimizes digital feedthroughcaused by the SCL signal on a static output. The serialinterface reconnects the SCL signal when a validSTART condition is detected.\nApplications Information\nPowering the Device From an \nExternal Reference\nThe MAX5812 uses the V DDas the DAC voltage refer-\nence. Any power-supply noise is directly coupled to thedevice output. The circuit in Figure 8 uses a precisionvoltage reference to power the MAX5812, isolating thedevice from any power-supply noise. Powering theMAX5812 in such a manner greatly improves overallperformance, especially in noisy systems. TheMAX6030 (3V, 75ppm/ °C) or the MAX6050 (5V,\n75ppm/ °C) precision voltage references are ideal\nchoices because of the low power requirements of theMAX5812. \nDigital Inputs and Interface Logic\nThe MAX5812 2-wire digital interface is I2C and SMBus-\ncompatible.
