The L\nT3470 combines Burst Mode \nand continuous operation to allow the use of tiny induc -\ntor and capacitors while providing a low ripple output to  \nloads of up to 200mA. \nWith \nits wide input range of 4V to 40V , the L T3470 can \nregulate a wide variety of power sources, from 2-cell Li\n-\nIon \nbatteries to unregulated wall transformers and lead-acid \nbatteries. Quiescent current in regulation is just 26µA in a typical application while a zero current shutdown mode disconnects the load from the input source, simplifying power management in battery-powered systems. Fast current limiting and hysteretic control protects the L T3470 and external components against shorted outputs, even at 40V input.\nAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nEfficiency and Power Loss vs Load Currentn Low Quiescent Current: 26µA at 12V IN to 3.3V OUT\nn Integrated Boost and Catch Diodes\nn Input Range: 4V to 40V\nn Low Output Ripple: <10mV\nn < 1µA in Shutdown Mode\nn Output V oltage: 1.25V to 16V\nn 200mA Output Current\nn Hysteretic Mode Control\n –\n Low Ripple Burst Mode® Operation at Light Loads\n – Continuous Operation at Higher Loads\nn Solution Size as Small as 50mm2\nn Low Profile (0.75mm) 3mm × 2mm Thermally  \nEnhanced 8-Lead DD and 1mm ThinSOT Packages\nn AEC-Q100 Qualified for Automotive Applications\nn Automotive Batter y Regulation\nn Power for Portable Products\nn Distributed Supply Regulation\nn Industrial Supplies\nn W all T ransformer Regulation\nLOAD CURRENT (mA)30EFFICIENCY (%)POWER LOSS (mW)\n40608090\n0.1 10 100\n3470 TA0220\n170\n50\n1011000\n100\n10\n0.1VIN = 12V\nVIN BOOST\nL T3470\nSW SHDN0.22µF\n22pF\n22µF 2.2µF\n3470 TA01aVIN\n7V TO 40V\nVOUT\n5V\n200mA\n604k1%\n200k1%33µH\nBIAS\nFB\nGNDOFF  ON\nLT34702\nRev.

Operating Waveforms of the L T3470 Converting 12V to 5V Using a 33µH Inductor and 10µF Output CapacitorThe L T3470 uses a hysteretic control scheme in conjunction \nwith Burst Mode operation to provide low output ripple and low quiescent current while using a tiny inductor and capacitors. \nOperation can best be understood by studying the Block Diagram. An error amplifier measures the output voltage through an external resistor divider tied to the FB pin. If the FB voltage is higher than V\nREF, the error amplifier will \nshut off all the high power circuitry, leaving the L T3470 in its micropower state. As the FB voltage falls, the error amplifier will enable the power section, causing the chip to begin switching, thus delivering charge to the output capacitor . If the load is light the part will alternate between micropower and switching states to keep the output in regulation (See Figure 1a). At higher loads the part will switch continuously while the error amp servos the top and bottom current limits to regulate the FB pin voltage to 1.25V (See Figure\n \n1b).\nThe switching action is controlled by an RS latch and two current comparators as follows: The switch turns on, and the current through it ramps up until the top current comparator trips and resets the latch causing the switch to turn off. While the switch is off, the inductor current ramps down through the catch diode. When both the bot -\ntom current comparator trips and the minimum off-time one-shot \nexpires, the latch turns the switch back on thus \ncompleting a full cycle. The hysteretic action of this control scheme results in a switching frequency that depends on inductor value, input and output voltage. Since the switch only turns on when the catch diode current falls below threshold, the part will automatically switch slower to keep inductor current under control during start-up or short-circuit conditions.\nThe switch driver operates from either the input or from \nthe BOOST pin. An external capacitor and internal diode is used to generate a voltage at the BOOST pin that is higher than the input supply. This allows the driver to fully saturate the internal bipolar NPN power switch for efficient operation.\nIf the SHDN pin is grounded, all internal circuits are turned \noff and V\nIN current reduces to the device leakage current, \ntypically a few nA.\n(1a) Burst Mode Operation (1b) Continuous Operation\nVOUT\n20mV/DIV\nIL\n100mA/DIV\n1ms/DIV\nVOUT\n20mV/DIV\nIL\n100mA/DIV\n5µs/DIV3470 F01aNO LOAD\n10mA LOAD\nVOUT\n20mV/DIV\nIL\n100mA/DIV\n1µs/DIV\nVOUT\n20mV/DIV\nIL\n100mA/DIV\n1µs/DIV3470 F1b200mA LOAD\n150mA LOADOPERATION\nLT34709\nRev. E For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInput Voltage Range\nThe minimum input voltage required to generate a par -\nticular output voltage in an L T3470 application is limited \nby either its 4V under\nvoltage lockout or by its maximum \nduty cycle. The duty cycle is the fraction of time that the internal switch is on and is determined by the input and output voltages:\n  DC=VOUT+VD\nVIN– VSW+VD\nwhere V D is the forward voltage drop of the catch diode \n(~0.6V) and V SW is the voltage drop of the internal switch \nat maximum load (~0.4V). Given DC MAX = 0.90, this leads \nto a minimum input voltage of:\n  VIN(MIN)=VOUT+VD\nDCMAX⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟+VSW– VD\nThis analysis assumes the part has started up such that the \ncapacitor tied between the BOOST and SW pins is charged to more than 2V . For proper start-up, the minimum input voltage is limited by the boost circuit as detailed in the section BOOST Pin Considerations.\nThe maximum input voltage is limited by the absolute \nmaximum V\nIN rating of 40V , provided an inductor of suf -\nficient value is used.  \nInductor Selection\nThe switching action of the L\nT3470 during continuous \noperation produces a square wave at the SW pin that \nresults in a triangle wave of current in the inductor . The hysteretic mode control regulates the top and bottom current limits (see Electrical Characteristics) such that the average inductor current equals the load current. For safe operation, it must be noted that the L T3470 cannot turn the switch on for less than ~150ns. If the inductor is small and the input voltage is high, the current through the switch may exceed safe operating limit before the L T3470 is able to turn off. To prevent this from happening, the following equation provides a minimum inductor value:\n  LMIN=VIN(MAX)• tON-TIME(MIN)\nIMAXwhere V IN(MAX) is the maximum input voltage for the ap -\nplication, t ON-TIME(MIN) is ~150ns and I MAX is the maximum \nallowable increase in switch current during a minimum switch on-time (150mA). While this equation provides a safe inductor value, the resulting application circuit may switch at too high a frequency to yield good efficiency. It is advised that switching frequency be below 1.2MHz during normal operation:\n  f=1– DC( ) VD+VOUT ( )\nL •∆IL\nwhere f is the switching frequency, ∆I L is the ripple current \nin the inductor (~150mA), V D is the forward voltage drop \nof the catch diode, and V OUT is the desired output voltage. \nIf the application circuit is intended to operate at high duty cycles (V\nIN close to V OUT), it is important to look at the \ncalculated value of the switch off-time:\n  tOFF-TIME=1– DC\nf\nThe calculated t OFF-TIME  should be more than L T3470’s \nminimum t OFF-TIME  (See Electrical Characteristics), so \nthe application circuit is capable of delivering full rated output current. If the full output current of 200mA is not required, the calculated t\nOFF-TIME  can be made less than \nminimum t OFF-TIME  possibly allowing the use of a smaller \ninductor .

The input \ncapacitor is required to reduce the resulting voltage ripple at the V\nIN pin of the L T3470 and to force this switching \ncurrent into a tight local loop, minimizing EMI. The input capacitor must have low impedance at the switching frequency to do this effectively. A 1µF to 2.2µF ceramic capacitor satisfies these requirements.\nIf the input source impedance is high, a larger value ca -\npacitor may be required to keep input ripple low. In this \ncase, an electrolytic of 10µF or more in parallel with a 1\nµF \nceramic is a good combination. Be aware that the input capacitor is subject to large surge currents if the L T3470 circuit is connected to a low impedance supply, and that some electrolytic capacitors (in particular tantalum) must be specified for such use.\nOutput Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor filters the inductor’s ripple current \nand stores energy to satisfy the load current when the L T3470 is quiescent. In order to keep output voltage ripple low, the impedance of the capacitor must be low at the L T3470’s switching frequency. The capacitor’s equivalent series resistance (ESR) determines this impedance. Choose one with low ESR intended for use in switching regulators. The contribution to ripple voltage due to the ESR is ap -\nproximately I\nLIM • ESR. ESR should be less than ~150mΩ. \nThe value of the output capacitor must be large enough to accept the energy stored in the inductor without a large change in output voltage. Setting this voltage step equal to 1% of the output voltage, the output capacitor must be:\n  COUT>50 • L •ILIM\nVOUT⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟2\nwhere I LIM is the top current limit with V FB = 0V (see Elec -\ntrical Characteristics). For example, an L T3470 producing 3.3V with L = 33µH requires 22µF\n. The calculated value \ncan be relaxed if small circuit size is more important than low output ripple. \nSanyo’s POSCAP series in B-case and provides very good \nperformance in a small package for the L T3470. Similar performance in traditional tantalum capacitors requires a larger package (C-case). With a high quality capacitor filtering the ripple current from the inductor , the output voltage ripple is determined by the delay in the L T3470’s feedback comparator . This ripple can be reduced further by adding a small (typically 22pF) phase lead capacitor between the output and the feedback pin.\nLT347011\nRev. E For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nCeramic Capacitors\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However , ceramic capacitors can cause problems when used with the L T3470. Not all ceramic capacitors are suitable. X5R and X7R types are stable over temperature and applied voltage and give dependable service. Other types, including Y5V and Z5U have very large temperature and voltage coefficients of capacitance. In an application circuit they may have only a small fraction of their nominal capacitance resulting in much higher output voltage ripple than expected. \nCeramic capacitors are piezoelectric. The L T3470’s switch -\ning frequency depends on the load current, and at light \nloads the L\nT3470 can excite the ceramic capacitor at audio \nfrequencies, generating audible noise. Since the L T3470 operates at a lower current limit during Burst Mode opera -\ntion, the noise is typically very quiet to a casual ear . If this audible noise is unacceptable, use a high per\nformance \nelectrolytic capacitor at the output. The input capacitor can be a parallel combination of a 2.2µF ceramic capacitor and a low cost electrolytic capacitor . \nA final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the L T3470. A ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable inductance forms a high quality (under damped) tank circuit. If the L T3470 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the input volt -\nage can ring to twice its nominal value, possibly exceeding the L\nT3470’s rating. This situation is easily avoided; see \nthe Hot-Plugging Safely section.BOOST and BIAS Pin Considerations\nCapacitor C3 and the internal boost Schottky diode (see \nBlock Diagram) are used to generate a boost voltage that is higher than the input voltage. In most cases a 0.22µF capacitor will work well. Figure 2 shows two ways to ar -\nrange the boost circuit. The BOOST pin must be more than 2.5V above the SW pin for best efficiency\n. For outputs of \n3.3V and above, the standard circuit (Figure 2a) is best. For outputs between 2.5V and 3V , use a 0.47µF . For lower output voltages the boost diode can be tied to the input \nFigure 2. T wo Circuits for Generating the Boost Voltage\nTable 3.

Diode D1 Prevents a Shorted Input from Discharging a  Backup Battery Tied to the Output; It Also Protects the Circuit from a Reversed Input. The L T3470 Runs Only When the Input Is Present Hot-Plugging SafelyAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n(Figure 2b). The circuit in Figure 2a is more efficient \nbecause the BOOST pin current and BIAS pin quiescent current comes from a lower voltage source. You must also be sure that the maximum voltage ratings of the BOOST and BIAS pins are not exceeded. \nThe minimum operating voltage of an L T3470 application \nis limited by the undervoltage lockout (4V) and by the maximum duty cycle as outlined in a previous section. For proper start-up, the minimum input voltage is also limited by the boost circuit. If the input voltage is ramped slowly, or the L T3470 is turned on with its SHDN pin when the output is already in regulation, then the boost capacitor may not be fully charged. The plots in Figure 3 show minimum V\nIN to start and to run. At light loads, the inductor current \nbecomes discontinuous and the effective duty cycle can be very high. This reduces the minimum input voltage to approximately 300mV above V\nOUT. At higher load currents, \nthe inductor current is continuous and the duty cycle is limited by the maximum duty cycle of the L T3470, requiring a higher input voltage to maintain regulation. \nShorted Input Protection\nIf the inductor is chosen so that it won’t saturate exces -\nsively at the top switch current limit maximum of 450mA, \nan L\nT3470 buck regulator will tolerate a shorted output \neven if V IN = 40V . There is another situation to consider \nin systems where the output will be held high when the input to the L T3470 is absent. This may occur in battery charging applications or in battery backup systems where a battery or some other supply is diode OR-ed with the L T3470’s output. If the V\nIN pin is allowed to float and the \nSHDN pin is held high (either by a logic signal or because it is tied to V\nIN), then the L T3470’s internal circuitry will \npull its quiescent current through its SW pin. This is fine if your system can tolerate a few mA in this state. If you ground the SHDN pin, the SW pin current will drop to es -\nsentially zero. However , if the V\nIN pin is grounded while \nthe output is held high, then parasitic diodes inside the L T3470 can pull large currents from the output through the SW pin and the V\nIN pin. Figure 4 shows a circuit that \nwill run only when the input voltage is present and that protects against a shorted or reversed input.

E For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPCB Layout\nFor proper operation and minimum EMI, care must be \ntaken during printed circuit board layout. Note that large, switched currents flow in the power switch, the internal catch diode and the input capacitor . The loop formed by these components should be as small as possible. Further -\nmore, the system ground should be tied to the regulator ground in only one place; this prevents the switched cur -\nrent from injecting noise into the system ground. These components, along with the inductor and output capacitor\n, \nshould be placed on the same side of the circuit board, and their connections should be made on that layer . Place a local, unbroken ground plane below these components, and tie this ground plane to system ground at one location, ideally at the ground terminal of the output capacitor C2. Additionally, the SW and BOOST nodes should be kept as small as possible. Unshielded inductors can induce noise in the feedback path resulting in instability and increased output ripple. To avoid this problem, use vias to route the V\nOUT trace under the ground plane to the feedback divider \n(as shown in Figure 5). Finally, keep the FB node as small as possible so that the ground pin and ground traces will shield it from the SW and BOOST nodes. Figure 5  \nshows component placement with trace, ground plane and via locations. Include vias near the GND pin, or pad, of the L\nT3470 to help remove heat from the L T3470 to \nthe ground plane.\nFigure 5.

E For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nHot-Plugging Safely\nThe small size, robustness and low impedance of ceramic \ncapacitors make them an attractive option for the input bypass capacitor of L T3470. However , these capacitors can cause problems if the L T3470 is plugged into a live supply (see Linear Technology Application Note 88 for a complete discussion). The low loss ceramic capacitor combined with stray inductance in series with the power source forms an under damped tank circuit, and the voltage at the V\nIN pin \nof the L T3470 can ring to twice the nominal input voltage, possibly exceeding the L T3470’s rating and damaging the part. If the input supply is poorly controlled or the user will be plugging the L T3470 into an energized supply, the input network should be designed to prevent this overshoot. Figure 6 shows the waveforms that result when an L T3470 circuit is connected to a 24V supply through six feet of 24-gauge twisted pair . The first plot is the response with a 2.2µF ceramic capacitor at the input. The input voltage rings as high as 35V and the input current peaks at 20A. One method of damping the tank circuit is to add another capacitor with a series resistor to the circuit. In Figure 6b an aluminum electrolytic capacitor has been added. This capacitor’s high equivalent series resistance damps the circuit and eliminates the voltage overshoot. The extra capacitor improves low frequency ripple filtering and can \nslightly improve the efficiency of the circuit, though it is likely to be the largest component in the circuit. An alterna -\ntive solution is shown in Figure 6c. A 1Ω resistor is added in series with the input to eliminate the voltage overshoot (it also reduces the peak input current). A 0.1\nµF capacitor \nimproves high frequency filtering. This solution is smaller and less expensive than the electrolytic capacitor . For high input voltages its impact on efficiency is minor , reducing efficiency less than one half percent for a 5V output at full load operating from 24V . \nHigh Temperature Considerations\nThe die junction temperature of the L T3470 must be \nlower than the maximum rating of 125°C (150°C for the  \nH-grade). This is generally not a concern unless the ambi -\nent temperature is above 85°C. For higher temperatures, \ncare should be taken in the layout of the cir\ncuit to ensure \ngood heat sinking of the L T3470. The maximum load current should be derated as the ambient temperature approaches the maximum junction rating. The die tem -\nperature is calculated by multiplying the L T3470 power dissipation by the thermal resistance from junction to ambient. Power dissipation within the L\nT3470 can be \nestimated by calculating the total power loss from an efficiency measurement. Thermal resistance depends on the layout of the circuit board and choice of package. The DD package with the exposed pad has a thermal resistance of approximately 80°C/W while the ThinSOT is approximately 150°C/W . Finally, be aware that at high ambient temperatures the internal Schottky diode will have significant leakage current (see Typical Performance Characteristics) increasing the quiescent current of the L T3470 converter . \nLT347015\nRev.
