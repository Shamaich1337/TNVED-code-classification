Two logic inputs control theH-\nbridge driver, which consists offour N-channel\nMOSFETs thatcancontrol motors bidirectionally with\nupto3.6-A peak current. The inputs can bepulse-\nwidth modulated (PWM) tocontrol motor speed, using\nachoice ofcurrent-decay modes. Setting both inputs\nlowenters alow-power sleep mode.\nThe DRV8870 device features integrated current\nregulation, based ontheanalog input VREF and the\nvoltage ontheISEN pin, which isproportional to\nmotor current through anexternal sense resistor. The\nability tolimit current toaknown level can\nsignificantly reduce thesystem power requirements\nand bulk capacitance needed tomaintain stable\nvoltage, especially for motor startup and stall\nconditions.\nThe device isfully protected from faults and short\ncircuits, including undervoltage (UVLO), overcurrent\n(OCP), and overtemperature (TSD).

The integrated current regulation restricts motor current toapredefined maximum. Two logic\ninputs control theH-bridge driver, which consists offour N-channel MOSFETs thathave atypical Rds(on) of565\nmΩ(including onehigh-side andonelow-side FET). Asingle-power input, VM, serves asboth device power and\nthemotor winding bias voltage. The integrated charge pump ofthedevice boosts VM internally and fully\nenhances thehigh-side FETs. Motor speed can becontrolled with pulse-width modulation, atfrequencies\nbetween 0to100kHz. The device hasanintegrated sleep mode thatisentered bybringing both inputs low. An\nassortment ofprotection features prevent thedevice from being damaged ifasystem fault occurs.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nFORWARD REVERSEOUT1 OUT2\n21\n22Forward drive\nSlow decay (brake)VM\n1\nOUT1 OUT2\n21\n22Reverse drive\nSlow decay (brake)VM\n1\n33High-Z (coast) 3High-Z (coast)\n3\n8DRV8870\nSLVSCY8B –AUGUST 2015 –REVISED JULY 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8870Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2015 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Bridge Control\nThe DRV8870 output consists offour N-channel MOSFETs that aredesigned todrive high current. These\noutputs arecontrolled bythetwologic inputs IN1andIN2aslisted inTable 1.\nTable 1.H-Bridge Control\nIN1 IN2 OUT1 OUT2 DESCRIPTION\n0 0 High-Z High-Z Coast; H-bridge disabled toHigh-Z (sleep entered after 1ms)\n0 1 L H Reverse (Current OUT2→OUT1)\n1 0 H L Forward (Current OUT1→OUT2)\n1 1 L L Brake; low-side slow decay\nThe inputs canbesettostatic voltages for100% duty cycle drive, orthey canbepulse-width modulated (PWM)\nforvariable motor speed. When using PWM, switching between driving and braking typically works best. For\nexample, todrive amotor forward with 50% ofthemaximum RPM, IN1=1andIN2=0during thedriving period,\nandIN1=1andIN2=1during theother period. Alternatively, thecoast mode (IN1 =0,IN2=0)forfastcurrent\ndecay isalso available. Theinput pins canbepowered before VMisapplied.\nFigure 4.H-Bridge Current Paths\n7.3.2 Sleep Mode\nWhen theIN1andIN2pins areboth lowfortime tSLEEP (typically 1ms), theDRV8870 device enters alow-power\nsleep mode, where theoutputs remain High-Z and thedevice uses IVMSLEEP (µA)ofcurrent. Ifthedevice is\npowered upwhile both inputs arelow, itimmediately enters sleep mode. After theIN1orIN2pins arehigh forat\nleast 5µs,thedevice isoperational 50µs(tON)later.\n7.3.3 Current Regulation\nThe DRV8870 device limits theoutput current based ontheanalog input, VREF, and theresistance ofan\nexternal sense resistor ontheISEN pinaccording toEquation 1:\nIN1\nIN2\nOUT1\ntDEAD tPD tR tDEADtF tPD\nOUT2\ntDEAD tPD tF tDEADtR tPD\nMotor Current (A)ITRIP\ntOFFtBLANK\ntDRIVE\nTRIP\nv ISEN ISENVREF(V) VREF(V)I (A)A R ( ) 10 R ( )  u : u :\n9DRV8870\nwww.ti.com SLVSCY8B –AUGUST 2015 –REVISED JULY 2016\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8870Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2015 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated(1)\nForexample, ifVREF =3.3VandaRISEN=0.15Ω,theDRV8870 device limits motor current to2.2Anomatter\nhow much load torque isapplied. Forguidelines onselecting asense resistor, seetheSense Resistor section.\nWhen ITRIPisreached, thedevice enforces slow current decay byenabling both low-side FETs, anditdoes this\nforatime oftOFF(typically 25µs).\nFigure 5.Current-Regulation Time Periods\nAfter tOFFelapses, theoutput isre-enabled according tothetwoinputs, INx. Thedrive time (tDRIVE )until reaching\nanother ITRIPevent heavily depends ontheVMvoltage, theback-EMF ofthemotor, and theinductance ofthe\nmotor.\n7.3.4 Dead Time\nWhen anoutput changes from driving high todriving low, ordriving lowtodriving high, dead time isautomatically\ninserted toprevent shoot-through.

TheITRIPcurrent issetabove thenormal operating current,\nand high enough toachieve anadequate spin-up time, butlowenough toconstrain current toadesired level.\nMotor speed iscontrolled bytheduty cycle ofone oftheinputs, while theother input isstatic. Brake orslow\ndecay istypically used during theoff-time.\n7.4.2 PWM Without Current Regulation\nIfcurrent regulation isnotrequired, theISEN pinshould bedirectly connected tothePCB ground plane. The\nVREF voltage must stillbe0.3to5V,andlarger voltages provide greater noise margin. This mode provides the\nhighest-possible peak current which isupto3.6Aforafew hundred milliseconds (depending onPCB\ncharacteristics and theambient temperature). Ifcurrent exceeds 3.6A,thedevice might reach overcurrent\nprotection (OCP) orovertemperature shutdown (TSD). Ifthathappens, thedevice disables andprotects itself for\nabout 3ms(tRETRY )andthen resumes normal operation.\n7.4.3 Static Inputs With Current Regulation\nThe IN1and IN2pins canbesethigh and lowfor100% duty cycle drive, and ITRIPcanbeused tocontrol the\ncurrent ofthemotor, speed, andtorque capability.\n7.4.4 VMControl\nInsome systems, varying VMasameans ofchanging motor speed isdesirable.

When aPCB isshared with other components generating heat, thesystem\ndesigner should addmargin. Measuring theactual sense resistor temperature inafinal system isalways best.\nBecause power resistors are larger and more expensive than standard resistors, using multiple standard\nresistors inparallel, between thesense node and ground, iscommon and distributes thecurrent and heat\ndissipation.\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 8.Current Ramp With a2-Ω,1mH,\nRLLoad andVM=12VFigure 9.Current Ramp With a2-Ω,1mH,\nRLLoad andVM=24V\n13DRV8870\nwww.ti.com SLVSCY8B –AUGUST 2015 –REVISED JULY 2016\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8870Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2015 –2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFigure 10.Current Ramp With a2-Ω,1mH,\nRLLoad andVM=45VFigure 11.tPD\nFigure 12.Current Regulation With VREF =2Vand\n150mΩFigure 13.OCP With 45VandtheOutputs Shorted\nTogether\nLocal \nBulk CapacitorParasitic Wire\nInductance\n+\n±Motor \nDriverPower Supply Motor Drive System\nVBB\nGND+\nIC Bypass \nCapacitor\n14DRV8870\nSLVSCY8B –AUGUST 2015 –REVISED JULY 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8870Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2015 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated9Power Supply Recommendations\n9.1 Bulk Capacitance\nHaving appropriate local bulk capacitance isanimportant factor inmotor drive system design. Having more bulk\ncapacitance isgenerally beneficial, while thedisadvantages areincreased cost andphysical size.\nTheamount oflocal capacitance needed depends onavariety offactors, including:\n•Thehighest current required bythemotor system\n•Thecapacitance ofthepower supply andability tosource current\n•Theamount ofparasitic inductance between thepower supply andmotor system\n•Theacceptable voltage ripple\n•Thetype ofmotor used (brushed DC,brushless DC,stepper)\n•Themotor braking method\nThe inductance between thepower supply andmotor drive system limits how therate current canchange from\nthepower supply. Ifthelocal bulk capacitance istoosmall, thesystem responds toexcessive current demands\nordumps from themotor with achange involtage. When adequate bulk capacitance isused, themotor voltage\nremains stable andhigh current canbequickly supplied.\nThe data sheet generally provides arecommended value, butsystem-level testing isrequired todetermine the\nappropriate sized bulk capacitor.\nFigure 14.Example Setup ofMotor Drive System With External Power Supply\nThe voltage rating forbulk capacitors should behigher than theoperating voltage, toprovide margin forcases\nwhen themotor transfers energy tothesupply.\nGND\nIN2\nIN1\nVREFOUT2\nISEN\nOUT1\nVM+\n15DRV8870\nwww.ti.com SLVSCY8B –AUGUST 2015 –REVISED JULY 2016\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8870Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2015 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated10Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nThe bulk capacitor should beplaced tominimize thedistance ofthehigh-current path through themotor driver\ndevice. The connecting metal trace widths should beaswide aspossible, and numerous vias should beused\nwhen connecting PCB layers. These practices minimize inductance and allow thebulk capacitor todeliver high\ncurrent.\nSmall-value capacitors should beceramic, andplaced closely todevice pins.\nThehigh-current device outputs should usewide metal traces.\nThe device thermal padshould besoldered tothePCB top-layer ground plane. Multiple vias should beused to\nconnect toalarge bottom-layer ground plane. The useoflarge metal planes andmultiple vias help dissipate the\nI²xRDS(on) heat thatisgenerated inthedevice.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 15shows therecommended layout andcomponent placement.\nFigure 15.Layout Recommendation\n10.3 Thermal Considerations\nThe DRV8870 device hasthermal shutdown (TSD) asdescribed intheThermal Shutdown (TSD) section. Ifthe\ndietemperature exceeds approximately 175°C,thedevice isdisabled until thetemperature drops below the\ntemperature hysteresis level.\nAny tendency ofthedevice toenter TSD isanindication ofeither excessive power dissipation, insufficient\nheatsinking, ortoohigh ofanambient temperature.\n10.4 Power Dissipation\nPower dissipation intheDRV8870 device isdominated bythepower dissipated intheoutput FET resistance,\nRDS(on) .Use theequation intheDrive Current section tocalculate theestimated average power dissipation when\ndriving aload.\nNote that atstartup, thecurrent ismuch higher than normal running current; thispeak current and itsduration\nmust bealso beconsidered.\nJ A D JAT T P R 58 C 0.46 ( ) W 48 C/W 8 ( ) 0 C T  \x0e u  q \x0e u q  q\n\x0b \x0c RMS D2\n( S ON) D ) ON ( S Power I High-side R  Low-side R| u \x0e\n16DRV8870\nSLVSCY8B –AUGUST 2015 –REVISED JULY 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: DRV8870Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2015 –2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedPower Dissipation (continued)\nThe maximum amount ofpower thatcanbedissipated inthedevice isdependent onambient temperature and\nheatsinking.\nNOTE\nRDS(on) increases with temperature, soasthe device heats, the power dissipation\nincreases.
