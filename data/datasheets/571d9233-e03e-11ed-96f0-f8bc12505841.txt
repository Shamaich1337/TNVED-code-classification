The bidirectional I2C channels \neliminate the need for splitting I2C signals into separate transmit  \nand receive signals for use with standalone optocouplers.  \n Based on the Analog Devices, Inc., iso Power  technology,  the  \non-chip isolated  dc-to-dc converter provides a regulated, isolated  \nvoltage of 3.15 V to 5.25 V with up to 150 mW of output power \n(see Figure 1).  \nWith the ADM3260, the iCoupler and iso Power channels , along \nwith the I2C transceivers , can be integrated with semiconductor \ncircuitr y, which enables  a complete isolated I2C interface and \nallows the po wer converter to be implemented in a small form \nfactor.  The ADM3260 is available in 20- lead SSOP package and \nhas an operating temperature range of −40°C to+105°C.  \nisoPower uses high frequency switching elements to transfer power  \nthrough its transformer. Special care must be taken during printed  \ncircuit board (PCB) layout to meet emissions standards. See the \nAN-0971 Application Note  for board layout recommendations.  \n \n1 Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952,849; 6,873,065; and 7,075,329.

E | Page 15 of 19 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION  \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nThe digital isolator block on the ADM3260 interfaces on each \nside to a bidirectional I2C signal. Internally, the I2C interface is \nsplit into two unidirectional channels co mmunicating in \nopposing directions via a dedicated i Coupler  isolation channel \nfor each. One channel (the bottom channel of each channel pair \nshown in  Figure 17) senses the voltage state of the Side 1 I2C \npin (SCL1 or SDA1)  and transmits its state to its respective Side \n2 I2C pin  (SCL2 or SDA2) . \nBoth the Side 1  (isolated side)  and the Side 2 (primary  side) I2C \npins interface to an I2C bus operating in the 3.0  V to 5.5 V range . \nA logic low on either pin causes the opp osite pin to pull low \nenough to comply with the logic low threshold requirements  of the \nother I2C devices on the bus. To a void I2C bus co ntention, \ninput a low threshold at SDA1 or SCL1 to  guarantee at  least \n50 mV less t han the output low signal at the same  pin. This step \nprevents  an output logic low at Side 1 from transmitt ing back to \nSide 2 and pulling down the I2C bus.  \nBecause the Side 2 logic levels  or thresholds are standard I2C \nvalues, multiple ADM3260 devices connected to a bus by their \nSide 2 pins communicate with each other and with other I2C-\ncompatible devices. I2C compatibility refers to situations in \nwhich the logic levels of a co mponent do not necessarily meet \nthe requirements of the I2C specification but still allow the \ncomponent to communicate with an I2C-compliant device. \nI2C compliance refers to situations in which the logic levels of \na component meet the requirements of the I2C specification.  \nHowever, because the Side 1 pin has a m odified output level/ \ninput threshold, this side of the ADM3260 communicate s only \nwith devices that conform to the I2C standard . In othe r words, \nSide 2 of the ADM3260 is I2C compliant, whereas Side 1 is o nly \nI2C compatible.  \nThe output logic low levels are independent of the VDDISO  \nand V DDP  voltages. The input logic low threshol d at Side 1 is \nalso independent of VDDISO . However, the inp ut logic low \nthreshold at  Side 2 is at 0.3 VDDP , consistent with I2C \nrequirements. The Side 1  and Side 2 pins have open- collector \noutputs whose high levels are set via pull -up resistors to their \nrespective supply voltages.  The dc -to-dc converter section o f the A DM3260 works on \nprinciples that are common to most modern power supplies. It  has \na split controller architecture with isolated pulse -width \nmodulation (PWM) feedback. VIN power is supplied  to an \noscillating circuit that switches current into a chip -scale air core \ntransformer. Power transferred to the secondary side is rectified \nand regulated to a value between 3.15 V and 5.25 V dep ending \non the setpoint supplied by an external voltage divid er (see \nEquation 1). The secondary  (VISO ) side controller regulates \nthe output by creating a PWM control signal that is sent to the \nprimary (VIN) side by a dedicated iCoupler data channel.  \nThe PWM modulates the oscillator circuit to control the power \nbeing sent to the secondary  side. Feedback allows for significantly \nhigher power and efficiency.  \n(V) 1.23\nBOTTOMBOTTOM TOP\nRR RVISO+×=  (1) \nwhere:  \nRTOP is a resistor between VSEL and VISO.  \nRBOTTOM  is a resistor between VSEL and GNDISO.  \nBecause the output voltage is  adjusted c ontinuously , there are \nan infinite number of operating conditions. This data sheet \naddresses three discrete operating conditions in the Specifications  \nsection. Many other combinations of input and output voltage ar e \npossible; Figure 14 depicts the supported voltage combinations \nat room temperature. Figure 14 was generated by using a fixed \nVISO load and decreasing the input voltage until the PWM was \nat 80% duty cycle. Each of the curves represents the mini mum \ninput voltage that is required for operation under this criterion. \nFor example, if the application requires 30 mA of output \ncurrent at 5 V, the minimum input voltage at V IN is 4.25 V. \nFigure 14 also illustrates that a configuration with VIN = 3.3 V and \nVISO  = 5 V is not recommended. Even at 10 mA of output \ncurrent, the PWM canno t maintain less than  80% duty factor, \nleaving no margin to s upport load or temperature variations.  \nTypically, the dc -to-dc converter section of the  ADM3260 \ndissipates about 17% more power betw een room temperature \nand maximum temperature; therefore, the 20% PWM margin \ncovers temperature variations.  \nThe isolated  converter  implements undervoltage lockout (UVLO) \nwith hysteresis on the input/output pin s of the primary and \nsecondary sides as well as the VIN  power input. This feature \nensures that the converter does not go into oscillation due to \nnoisy input power or slow power -on ramp rates.  \n \n    \nADM3260  Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 16 of 19 DIGITAL ISOLATOR STA RTUP  \nBoth the VDDISO  and VDDP  supplies of the digital isolator \nblock have an undervoltage lockout fea ture to prevent the \nsignal channels from operating unless certain criteria are met. \nThis feature prevents input logic low signals from pulling down the I\n2C bus inadvertently during pow er-up/powe r-down.  \nTo enable the signal channels, the following two crite ria must be met : \n• Both supplies must be at least 2.5 V. \n• At least 40 µ s must elapse after both supplies exceed the \ninternal start -up threshold of 2.0 V. \nUntil both criteria are met for b oth suppli es, pull the outputs of \nthe digital isolator block of the ADM3260 high, ensuring a startup  \nthat avoids any disturbances on the bus.  \nFigure 18 and Figure 19 illustrate  the supply conditions for fast \nand slow input supply slew rates. \nMINIMUM RECOMMENDED\nOPERATING SUPPLY, 3.0V\nMINIMUM VALID SUPPLY, 2.5V\nINTERNAL START-UP\nTHRESHOLD, 2.0V\n40µsSUPPLY VALID\n11890-018 \nFigure 18.

E | Page 17 of 19 In applic ations involving high common -mode transient s, design \nthe board layout such that any coupling that does occur  affects \nall pins on a given component side  equally . Failure to ensure this \ncan cause voltage differentials between pins,  exceeding the \nabsolute max imum ratings specified in Table 13, and thereby \nleading to latch- up and/or perman ent damage.  \nTHERMAL ANALYSIS  \nThe ADM3260  consist of  four internal die attache d to a split lead \nframe with four  die attach paddle s. For the purposes of thermal \nanalysis, treat the chip as a therm al unit, with the highest junction \ntemperature reflected  in the θ JA value from Table 8. The value of \nθJA is based on measurements  taken with the device s mounted on \na JEDEC standard, 4 -layer board with fine width traces and still \nair. Under normal operating conditions, the ADM3260 operates \nat a full load across the full temperature range without derating \nthe output current.   \nPower dissipation  in the device  varies with ambient \ntemperature due to the characteristics of the switc hing and \nrectification elements. Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the \nrelationship between total power dissipation at two load \nconditions and ambient temperature. Use t his information to \ndetermine the junc tion temperature at various operating \nconditions to ensure that the device does not go into thermal \nshutdown unexpectedly . \nEMI CONSIDERATIONS  \nThe dc-to-dc converter section of the ADM3260 compo nents \nmust operate at a very high frequency to allow efficient power \ntransfer through the small transformers. This high frequency \noperation  creates high frequency currents that propagate in \ncircuit bo ard ground and power planes, causing edge and \ndipole rad iation. Grounded enclosures are recommended for \napplications  that use these devices. If grounded enclosures are \nnot possible, follow good RF design practices in the layout of the PCB. See the AN-0971 Application Note  for the most current \nPCB layout recommendations for the ADM3260. \nINSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected to \nvoltage stress ove r a sufficiently long period. The rate of insulation  \ndegradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage waveform applied across the insulation. Analog Devices conducts an extensive set of evaluations to determine the lifetime of the \ninsulation structure within the ADM3260. \n \n \n Accelerated life testing is performed using voltage levels higher \nthan the rated continuous working voltage. Acceleration factors for \nseveral operating conditio ns are determined, allowing calculation  \nof the time to failure at the working voltage of interest. The values  \nshown in Table 14 summarize the peak voltages for 50  years of \nservice life in several operating conditions. In many case s, the \nworking voltage approved by agency testing is higher than the \n50-year service life voltage. Operation at working volta ges \nhigher than the service life voltage listed leads to premature \ninsulation failure.  \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADM3260 depends on the voltage  \nwaveform type imposed across the isolation barrier. The i Coupler  \ninsulation structure degrades at different rates, depending on \nwhether the waveform is bipolar ac,  unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 24, \nFigure 25, and Figure 26 illustrate these different isolation voltage \nwaveforms.  \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. A 50 -year \noperating lifetime under the bipolar ac condition determines \nthe Analog Devices recommended maximum working voltage.  \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insulation  \nis significan tly lower. This allows operation at higher working \nvoltages while still achieving a 50 -year service life. The working \nvoltages listed in Table 14 can be applied while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime, provided that the vol tage conforms to \neither  the unipolar ac or dc voltage c ases. Any cross- insulation \nvoltage waveform that does not conform to Figure 25 or Figure 26 \nmust be treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak v oltage must \nbe limited to the 50 -year lifetime voltage value listed in \nTable 14. \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n11890-024 \nFigure 24.
