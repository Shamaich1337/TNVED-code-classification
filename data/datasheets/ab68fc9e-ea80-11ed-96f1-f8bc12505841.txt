The output is band limited\nto frequencies above DC to below half the samplingfrequency.\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio between the\nRMS amplitude of the fundamental input frequency and\nthe RMS amplitude of all other frequency components\nexcept the first five harmonics and DC.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nTotal harmonic distortion is the ratio of the RMS sum of all\nharmonics of the input signal to the fundamental itself. Theout-of-band harmonics alias into the frequency band\nbetween DC and half the sampling frequency. THD is\nexpressed as:\nTHD = 20Log ( √(V2\n2 + V32 + V42 + . . . Vn2)/V1)\nwhere V1 is the RMS amplitude of the fundamental fre-quency and V2 through Vn are the amplitudes of thesecond through nth harmonics. The THD calculated in this\ndata sheet uses all the harmonics up to the fifth.\nIntermodulation Distortion\nIf the ADC input signal consists of more than one spectral\ncomponent, the ADC transfer function nonlinearity can\nproduce intermodulation distortion (IMD) in addition toTHD. IMD is the change in one sinusoidal input caused by\nthe presence of another sinusoidal input at a different\nfrequency.If two pure sine waves of frequencies fa and fb are appliedto the ADC input, nonlinearities in the ADC transfer func-\ntion can create distortion products at the sum and differ-\nence frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where m and n = 0, 1, 2, 3,\netc. The 3rd order intermodulation products are 2fa + fb,\n2fb + fa, 2fa – fb and 2fb – fa. The intermodulation\ndistortion is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of eitherinput tone to the RMS value of the largest 3rd order\nintermodulation product.\nSpurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\nSpurious free dynamic range is the peak harmonic or\nspurious noise that is the largest spectral component\nexcluding the input signal and DC. This value is expressedin decibels relative to the RMS value of a full scale input\nsignal.\nInput Bandwidth\nThe input bandwidth is that input frequency at which the\namplitude of the reconstructed fundamental is reduced by3dB for a full scale input signal.\nAperture Delay Time\nThe time from when a rising ENC\n+ equals the ENC– voltage\nto the instant that the input signal is held by the sample and\nhold circuit.\nAperture Delay Jitter\nThe variation in the aperture delay time from conversion to\nconversion. This random variation will result in noise\nwhen sampling an AC input. The signal to noise ratio due\nto the jitter alone will be:\nSNR JITTER  = –20log (2 π • fIN • tJITTER )\nLTC2232/LTC2233\n1522323faAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nCONVERTER OPERATION\nAs shown in Figure 1, the LTC2232/LTC2233 is a CMOS\npipelined multistep converter. The converter has five\npipelined ADC stages; a sampled analog input will result in\na digitized value five cycles later (see the Timing Diagram\nsection). For optimal AC performance the analog inputs\nshould be driven differentially. For cost sensitive applica-\ntions, the analog inputs can be driven single-ended with\nslightly worse harmonic distortion. The encode input is\ndifferential for improved common mode noise immunity.\nThe LTC2232/LTC2233 has two phases of operation,\ndetermined by the state of the differential ENC+/ENC– input\npins. For brevity, the text will refer to ENC+ greater than\nENC– as ENC high and ENC+ less than ENC– as ENC low.\nEach pipelined stage shown in Figure 1 contains an ADC,\na reconstruction DAC and an interstage residue amplifier.In operation, the ADC quantizes the input to the stage andthe quantized value is subtracted from the input by theDAC to produce a residue. The residue is amplified andoutput by the residue amplifier. Successive stages operateout of phase so that when the odd stages are outputtingtheir residue, the even stages are acquiring that residueand vice versa.\nWhen ENC is low, the analog input is sampled differentially\ndirectly onto the input sample-and-hold capacitors, insidethe “Input S/H” shown in the block diagram. At the instantthat ENC transitions from low to high, the sampled inputis held. While ENC is high, the held input voltage isbuffered by the S/H amplifier which drives the first pipelinedADC stage. The first stage acquires the output of the S/Hduring this high phase of ENC. When ENC goes back low,the first stage produces its residue which is acquired bythe second stage. At the same time, the input S/H goesback to acquiring the analog input. When ENC goes backhigh, the second stage produces its residue which isacquired by the third stage. An identical process is re-peated for the third and fourth stages, resulting in a fourthstage residue that is sent to the fifth stage ADC for finalevaluation.Each ADC stage following the first has additional range toaccommodate flash and amplifier offset errors. Resultsfrom all of the ADC stages are digitally synchronized suchthat the results can be properly combined in the correctionlogic before being sent to the output buffer.\nSAMPLE/HOLD OPERATION AND INPUT DRIVE\nSample/Hold Operation\nFigure 2 shows an equivalent circuit for the LTC2232/\nLTC2233 CMOS differential sample-and-hold. The analoginputs are connected to the sampling capacitors (C\nSAMPLE )\nthrough NMOS transistors. The capacitors shown at-tached to each input (C\nPARASITIC ) are the summation of all\nother capacitance associated with each input.\nFigure 2.

During the holdphase when ENC is high, the sampling capacitors aredisconnected from the input and the held voltage is passedto the ADC core for processing. As ENC transitions fromhigh to low, the inputs are reconnected to the samplingcapacitors to acquire a new sample. Since the samplingcapacitors still hold the previous sample, a charging glitchproportional to the change in voltage between samples willbe seen at this time. If the change between the last sampleand the new sample is small, the charging glitch seen atthe input will be small. If the input change is large, such asthe change seen with input frequencies near Nyquist, thena larger charging glitch will be seen.\nSingle-Ended Input\nFor cost sensitive applications, the analog inputs can be\ndriven single-ended. With a single-ended input the har-monic distortion and INL will degrade, but the SNR andDNL will remain unchanged. For a single-ended input, A\nIN+\nshould be driven with the input signal and A IN– should be\nconnected to 1.6V or V CM.\nCommon Mode Bias\nFor optimal performance the analog inputs should be\ndriven differentially. Each input should swing ±0.5V for\nthe 2V range or ±0.25V for the 1V range, around a\ncommon mode voltage of 1.6V. The V CM output pin (Pin\n44) may be used to provide the common mode bias level.\nVCM can be tied directly to the center tap of a transformer\nto set the DC input level or as a reference level to an op ampdifferential driver circuit. The V\nCM pin must be bypassed to\nground close to the ADC with a 2.2 µF or greater capacitor.\nInput Drive Impedance\nAs with all high performance, high speed ADCs, the\ndynamic performance of the LTC2232/LTC2233 can be\ninfluenced by the input drive circuitry, particularly the\nsecond and third harmonics. Source impedance and inputreactance can influence SFDR. At the falling edge of ENC,APPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nthe sample-and-hold circuit will connect the 1.6pF sam-pling capacitor to the input pin and start the samplingperiod. The sampling period ends when ENC rises, holding\nthe sampled input on the sampling capacitor. Ideally the\ninput circuitry should be fast enough to fully chargethe sampling capacitor during the sampling period\n1/(2F\nENCODE ); however, this is not always possible and the\nincomplete settling may degrade the SFDR. The sampling\nglitch has been designed to be as linear as possible to\nminimize the effects of incomplete settling.\nFor the best performance, it is recommended to have a\nsource impedance of 100 Ω or less for each input. The\nsource impedance should be matched for the differentialinputs. Poor matching will result in higher even orderharmonics, especially the second.\nInput Drive Circuits\nFigure 3 shows the LTC2232/LTC2233 being driven by an\nRF transformer with a center tapped secondary. The\nsecondary center tap is DC biased with V\nCM, setting the\nADC input signal at its optimum DC level. Terminating on\nthe transformer secondary is desirable, as this provides a\ncommon mode path for charging glitches caused by the\nsample and hold. Figure 3 shows a 1:1 turns ratio trans-former. Other turns ratios can be used if the source\nimpedance seen by the ADC does not exceed 100 Ω for\neach ADC input. A disadvantage of using a transformer is\nthe loss of low frequency response. Most small RF trans-\nformers have poor performance at frequencies below\n1MHz.\nFigure 3.

The advantage of this method is that it provides low\nfrequency input response; however, the limited gain band-width of most op amps will limit the SFDR at high input\nfrequencies.\nFigure 5 shows a single-ended input circuit. The imped-\nance seen by the analog inputs should be matched. This\ncircuit is not recommended if low distortion is required.\nThe 25Ω resistors and 12pF capacitor on the analog inputs\nserve two purposes: isolating the drive circuitry from the\nsample-and-hold charging glitches and limiting the\nwideband noise at the converter input. For input frequen-cies higher than 100MHz, the capacitor may need to be\ndecreased to prevent excessive signal loss.\nFor input frequencies above 100MHz the input circuits of\nFigure 6, 7 and 8 are recommended. The balun trans-\nformer gives better high frequency response than a flux\ncoupled center tapped transformer. The coupling capaci-tors allow the analog inputs to be DC biased at 1.6V. In\nFigure 8 the series inductors are impedance matching\nelements that maximize the ADC bandwidth.\nReference Operation\nFigure 9 shows the LTC2232/LTC2233 reference circuitry\nconsisting of a 1.6V bandgap reference, a differenceamplifier and switching and control circuit. The internal\nvoltage reference can be configured for two pin selectableinput ranges of 2V ( ±1V differential) or 1V ( ±0.5V differ-\nential). Tying the SENSE pin to V\nDD selects the 2V range;\ntyping the SENSE pin to V CM selects the 1V range.\nThe 1.6V bandgap reference serves two functions: itsoutput provides a DC bias point for setting the common\nmode voltage of any external input circuitry; additionally,the reference is used with a difference amplifier to gener-\nate the differential reference levels needed by the internal\nADC circuitry. An external bypass capacitor is required forthe 1.6V reference output, V\nCM. This provides a high\nfrequency low impedance path to ground for internal andexternal circuitry.\nThe difference amplifier generates the high and low refer-\nence for the ADC. High speed switching circuits are\nconnected to these outputs and they must be externallybypassed. Each output has four pins: two each of REFHA\nand REFHB for the high reference and two each of REFLA\nand REFLB for the low reference. The multiple output pinsare needed to reduce package inductance. Bypass capaci-\ntors must be connected as shown in Figure 9.\nOther voltage ranges in between the pin selectable ranges\ncan be programmed with two external resistors as shown\nin Figure 10. An external reference can be used by applying\nits output directly or through a resistor divider to SENSE.\nIt is not recommended to drive the SENSE pin with a logic\ndevice. The SENSE pin should be tied to the appropriate\nlevel as close to the converter as possible.

The\n2V input range will provide the best signal-to-noise perfor-\nmance while maintaining excellent SFDR. The 1V input\nrange will have better SFDR performance, but the SNR will\ndegrade by 1.5dB. See the Typical Performance Charac-\nteristics section.\nDriving the Encode Inputs\nThe noise performance of the LTC2232/LTC2233 can\ndepend on the encode signal quality as much as on the\nanalog input. The ENC+/ENC– inputs are intended to be\ndriven differentially, primarily for noise immunity fromcommon mode noise sources. Each input is biased through\na 6k resistor to a 1.6V bias. The bias resistors set the DC\noperating point for transformer coupled drive circuits and\ncan set the logic threshold for single-ended drive circuits.\nAny noise present on the encode signal will result in\nadditional aperture jitter that will be RMS summed with the\ninherent ADC aperture jitter.In applications where jitter is critical (high input frequen-\ncies) take the following into consideration:\n1. Differential drive should be used.\n2. Use as large an amplitude as possible; if transformer\ncoupled use a higher turns ratio to increase the amplitude.\n3. If the ADC is clocked with a sinusoidal signal, filter the\nencode signal to reduce wideband noise.\n4. Balance the capacitance and series resistance at both\nencode inputs so that any coupled noise will appear at both\ninputs as common mode noise. The encode inputs have a\ncommon mode range of 1.1V to 2.5V. Each input may be\ndriven from ground to V\nDD for single-ended drive.\nMaximum and Minimum Encode Rates\nThe maximum encode rate for the LTC2232/LTC2233 is\n105Msps (LTC2232) and 80Msps (LTC2233). For the ADCto operate properly, the encode signal should have a 50%\n(±5%) duty cycle. Each half cycle must have at least 4.5ns\n(LTC2232) or 5.9ns (LTC2233) for the ADC internal cir-\ncuitry to have enough settling time for proper operation.\nAchieving a precise 50% duty cycle is easy with differential\nsinusoidal drive using a transformer or using symmetricdifferential logic such as PECL or LVDS.\nAn optional clock duty cycle stabilizer circuit can be used\nif the input clock has a non 50% duty cycle. This circuituses the rising edge of the ENC\n+ pin to sample the analog\ninput. The falling edge of ENC+ is ignored and the internal\nfalling edge is generated by a phase-locked loop. The inputclock duty cycle can vary from 20% to 80% and the clock\nduty cycle stabilizer will maintain a constant 50% internal\nduty cycle. If the clock is turned off for a long period oftime, the duty cycle stabilizer circuit will require a hundred\nclock cycles for the PLL to lock onto the input clock. To use\nthe clock duty cycle stabilizer, the MODE pin should beconnected to 1/3V\nDD or 2/3V DD using external resistors.APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nFigure 11.

The\npipelined architecture of this ADC relies on storing analogsignals on small valued capacitors. Junction leakage will\ndischarge the capacitors. The specified minimum operat-\ning frequency for the LTC2232/LTC2233 is 1Msps.\nDIGITAL OUTPUTS\nTable 1 shows the relationship between the analog input\nvoltage, the digital data bits and the overflow bit.APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nFigure 12a. Single-Ended ENC Drive,\nNot Recommended for Low JitterDigital Output Buffers\nFigure 13 shows an equivalent circuit for a single output\nbuffer. Each buffer is powered by OV DD and OGND, iso-\nlated from the ADC power and ground. The additional N-channel transistor in the output driver allows operationdown to low voltages. The internal resistor in series withthe output makes the output appear as 50 Ω to external\ncircuitry and may eliminate the need for external dampingresistors.\nAs with all high speed/high resolution converters, the\ndigital output loading can affect the performance. Thedigital outputs of the LTC2232/LTC2233 should drive aminimal capacitive load to avoid possible interaction be-tween the digital outputs and sensitive input circuitry. Theoutput should be buffered with a device such as anALVCH16373 CMOS latch. For full speed operation thecapacitive load should be kept under 10pF.\nLower OV\nDD voltages will also help reduce interference\nfrom the digital outputs.\nFigure 12b.

Theformat is selected with the MODE pin. Connecting MODEto GND or 1/3V\nDD selects offset binary output format.\nConnecting MODE to 2/3V DD or V DD selects 2’s comple-\nment output format.

The CLKOUT pin can be used\nto synchronize the converter data to the digital system. Thisis necessary when using a sinusoidal encode. Data will beupdated just after CLKOUT rises and can be latched on thefalling edge of CLKOUT.Table 2.

The powersupply for the digital output buffers, OV\nDD, should be tied\nto the same power supply as for the logic being driven. Forexample if the converter is driving a DSP powered by a 1.8Vsupply then OV\nDD should be tied to that same 1.8V supply.\nOVDD can be powered with any voltage up to 3.6V. OGND\ncan be powered with any voltage from GND up to 1V andmust be less than OV\nDD. The logic outputs will swing be-\ntween OGND and OV DD.\nOutput Enable\nThe outputs may be disabled with the output enable pin, OE.\nOE high disables all data outputs including OF and CLKOUT.The data access and bus relinquish times are too slow toallow the outputs to be enabled and disabled during fullspeed operation. The output Hi-Z state is intended for useduring long periods of inactivity.\nSleep and Nap Modes\nThe converter may be placed in shutdown or nap modes\nto conserve power. Connecting SHDN to GND results innormal operation. Connecting SHDN to V\nDD and OE to V DD\nresults in sleep mode, which powers down all circuitryincluding the reference and typically dissipates 1mW. Whenexiting sleep mode it will take milliseconds for the outputdata to become valid because the reference capacitors have\nLTC2232/LTC2233\n2322323fato recharge and stabilize. Connecting SHDN to V DD and OE\nto GND results in nap mode, which typically dissipates\n30mW. In nap mode, the on-chip reference circuit is kepton, so that recovery from nap mode is faster than that fromsleep mode, typically taking 100 clock cycles. In both sleepand nap mode all digital outputs are disabled and enter theHi-Z state.\nGROUNDING AND BYPASSING\nThe LTC2232/LTC2233 requires a printed circuit board with\na clean unbroken ground plane. A multilayer board with aninternal ground plane is recommended. Layout for theprinted circuit board should ensure that digital and analogsignal lines are separated as much as possible. In particu-lar, care should be taken not to run any digital track along-side an analog signal track or underneath the ADC.\nHigh quality ceramic bypass capacitors should be used at\nthe V\nDD, OVDD, VCM, REFHA, REFHB, REFLA and REFLB pins\nas shown in the block diagram on the front page of this datasheet. Bypass capacitors must be located as close to thepins as possible. Of particular importance are the capaci-tors between REFHA and REFLB and between REFHB andREFLA. These capacitors should be as close to the deviceas possible (1.5mm or less). Size 0402 ceramic capacitorsare recommended. The 2.2 µF capacitor between REFHA and\nREFLA can be somewhat further away. The traces connect-ing the pins and bypass capacitors must be kept short andshould be made as wide as possible.\nThe LTC2232/LTC2233 differential inputs should run par-\nallel and close to each other. The input traces should be asshort as possible to minimize capacitance and to minimizenoise pickup.\nHEAT TRANSFER\nMost of the heat generated by the LTC2232/LTC2233 is\ntransferred from the die through the bottom-side exposedpad and package leads onto the printed circuit board. Forgood electrical and thermal performance, the exposed padshould be soldered to a large grounded pad on the PC board.It is critical that all ground pins are connected to a groundplane of sufficient area.APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nLTC2232/LTC2233\n2422323faClock Sources for Undersampling\nUndersampling raises the bar on the clock source and the\nhigher the input frequency, the greater the sensitivity to\nclock jitter or phase noise. A clock source that degradesSNR of a full-scale signal by 1dB at 70MHz will degrade\nSNR by 3dB at 140MHz, and 4.5dB at 190MHz.\nIn cases where absolute clock frequency accuracy is\nrelatively unimportant and only a single ADC is required,\na 3V canned oscillator from vendors such as Saronix or\nVectron can be placed close to the ADC and simplyconnected directly to the ADC. If there is any distance to\nthe ADC, some source termination to reduce ringing that\nmay occur even over a fraction of an inch is advisable. Youmust not allow the clock to overshoot the supplies or\nperformance will suffer. Do not filter the clock signal with\na narrow band filter unless you have a sinusoidal clocksource, as the rise and fall time artifacts present in typical\ndigital clock signals will be translated into phase noise.\nThe lowest phase noise oscillators have single-ended\nsinusoidal outputs, and for these devices the use of a filter\nclose to the ADC may be beneficial. This filter should be\nclose to the ADC to both reduce roundtrip reflection times,as well as reduce the susceptibility of the traces between\nthe filter and the ADC. If you are sensitive to close-in phase\nnoise, the power supply for oscillators and any buffersmust be very stable, or propagation delay variation withsupply will translate into phase noise. Even though these\nclock sources may be regarded as digital devices, do not\noperate them on a digital supply. If your clock is also usedto drive digital devices such as an FPGA, you should locate\nthe oscillator, and any clock fan-out devices close to the\nADC, and give the routing to the ADC precedence. Theclock signals to the FPGA should have series termination\nat the source to prevent high frequency noise from the\nFPGA disturbing the substrate of the clock fan-out device.If you use an FPGA as a programmable divider, you must\nre-time the signal using the original oscillator, and the re-\ntiming flip-flop as well as the oscillator should be close tothe ADC, and powered with a very quiet supply.\nFor cases where there are multiple ADCs, or where the\nclock source originates some distance away, differentialclock distribution is advisable. This is advisable both from\nthe perspective of EMI, but also to avoid receiving noise\nfrom digital sources both radiated, as well as propagatedin the waveguides that exist between the layers of multi-\nlayer PCBs. The differential pairs must be close together,\nand distanced from other signals. The differential pairshould be guarded on both sides with copper distanced at\nleast 3x the distance between the traces, and grounded\nwith vias no more than 1/4 inch apart.APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nLTC2232/LTC2233\n2522323faGND\nGNDGNDV\nCC\n2LE1LE2OE1OE1D11D21D31D41D51D61D71D82D12D22D32D42D52D62D72D8GND\nV\nCC\nGND\nGND\nVCC\nGNDGND\nV\nCC\n1Q11Q21Q31Q41Q51Q61Q71Q82Q12Q22Q32Q42Q52Q62Q72Q8AIN+\nAIN–\nREFHAREFHAGNDGNDREFLBREFLBREFHBREFHBREFLAREFLAV\nDD\nVDD\nVDD\nVDD\nVDD\nENC+\nENC–\nSHDNOELV\nCM\nSENSEMODECLKOUT\nNCNC\nD0D1D2D3D4D5D6D7D8D9\nOF\nOV\nDD\nOVDD\nOVDD\nOVDD\nOGNDOGNDOGNDOGND\nGNDGNDLTC2232*\n39\n3735333129272523211917151311\n9753134\n453942254824\n1\n4746444341403837363533323029272628\n31211518104723568911121314161719202223403836343230282624222018161412108642\nRN1D 33Ω\nRN1C 33Ω\nRN1B 33Ω\nRN1A 33Ω\nRN2D 33Ω\nRN2C 33Ω\nRN2B 33Ω\nRN2A 33Ω\nRN3D 33Ω\nRN3C 33Ω\nRN3B 33Ω\nRN3A 33Ω\nA0\nA1A2A3V\nCC\nWP\nSCL\nSDA12348765R10\n10k\nR910k R810kC170.1 µF\nC160.1 µFC33\n0.1 µF\nV\nCCVCC\nNC7SV86P5X\n44\n51\n21\n2\n35\n3VCC\nCLKOUT CLKOUTJP1\nR3\n33Ω\nD0\nD1D2D3D4D5D6D7D8D9\nD10D111\n234\n1315\n56789\n10464711121416171819444342202124252629303134353639404137332823383227224845\nC13\n0.1 µFC120.1 µFC100.1 µFC1133pF\nC152.2 µFC72.2 µFC60.1 µF\nC90.1 µFC51µF\nC81µF\nVCCC21\n0.1 µF\nC20\n0.1 µF\nC19\n0.1 µF\nC18\n0.1 µFC24\n0.1 µF\nC22\n0.1 µFVDDVDD\nVDD\nVCM\nEXT\nREFVDD\nVCM\nEXT\nREFR12\n1k\nR13\n1k\nR14\n1k2/3V DD\n1/3V DD\nGNDJP4\nMODEJP3\nSENSECLK\nCLKVDD VDD\nSHDN\nVDD\nGNDJP2VCC\nC4\n0.1 µFC1\n0.1 µF\nC3\n0.1 µF\nR5\n50R224.9\nR4\n24.9\nR6*R1*\nC2*\nV\nCMANALOG\nINPUTT1*\nJ1R19\nOPT\nR17\n105kC320.1 µFC254.7 µFC310.1 µFC300.1 µFC290.1 µF VCC\nOUT\nADJGNDBYPIN\nGNDGND\nSHDN\nR18\n100k1\n2348765\nC26\n0.1 µFC23\n0.1 µF\nR15100ΩR16100ΩENCODE\nINPUTCLK\nCLKT2\nETC1-1T\nJ3VDD\nVDD\n3.3V\nPWR\nGNDGND\nC2710 µF\n6.3V\nC28\n0.01 µFLT1763VCC\nVDDGND\n49PI74VCX16373A\n24LC0253201S-40G1NC7SV86P5X\nC341µF(2.5V)Evaluation Circuit Schematic of the LTC2232APPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nAssembly Type U1 R1, R6 C2 T1\nDC751A-A LTC2222 24.9 Ω 12pF ETC1-1T\nDC751A-B LTC2223 24.9 Ω 12pF ETC1-1T\nDC751A-C LTC2232 24.9 Ω 12pF ETC1-1T\nDC751A-D LTC2233 24.9 Ω 12pF ETC1-1T\nDC751A-E LTC2222 12.4 Ω 8.2pF ETC1-1-13\nDC751A-F LTC2223 12.4 Ω 8.2pF ETC1-1-13\nDC751A-G LTC2232 12.4 Ω 8.2pF ETC1-1-13\nDC751A-H LTC2233 12.4 Ω 8.2pF ETC1-1-13\n*Depends On Version Type\nLTC2232/LTC2233\n2622323faSilkscreen Top\nLayer 1 Component Side Layer 2 GND Plane\nLayer 3 Power Plane Layer 4 Bottom SideAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nLTC2232/LTC2233\n2722323faPACKAGE DESCRIPTIOU\nInformation furnished by Linear Technology Corporation is believed to be accurate and reliable.\nHowever, no responsibility is assumed for its use.
