Using EEPROM technology \nto maintain data in the absence of power, the DS1682 \nrequires no backup power source. The DS1682 \ndetects and records the number of events on the \nEVENT pin and the total cumulative event time since the DS1682 was last reset to 0. The ALARM  pin \nalerts the user when the total time accumulated \nequals the user-programmed alarm value. The \npolarity of the open-drain ALARM  pin can be \nprogrammed to either drive low or to become high \nimpedance upon an alarm condition. The DS1682 is \nideal for applications that monitor the total amount of time that a device has been in operation and/or the \nnumber of uses since inception of service, repair, or \nthe last calibration. \n \nAPPLICATIONS \nHigh-Temp, Rugged, Industrial Applications Where \nVibration or Shock Could Damage a Quartz \nCrystal \nAny System Where Time-of-Use is Important \n(Warranty Tracking)  \n \nORDERING INFORMATION \nPART * PIN-PACKAGE TOP \nMARK \x86 \nDS1682S 8 SO DS1682 \nDS1682S+ 8 SO DS1682 \nDS1682S/T&R 8 SO (Tape and Reel)  DS1682 \nDS1682S+T&R 8 SO (Tape and Reel)  DS1682 \n* All devices are specified over the -40°C to +85°C operating \nrange. \n\x86 A \x93\x91+\x94 anywhere on the top mark denotes a lead-free device. \n+ Denotes a lead-free/RoHS-compliant device.

The EVENT pin is the input the DS1682 monitors to determine when \nan event occurs. When the pin is pulle d high, the contents of the EEPROM are \ntransferred to the ETC and the oscillator st arts. The ETC begins to count in quarter-\nsecond increments. When the EVENT pin falls to logic 0, the event counter increments, and the event counter, ETC, a nd user-memory data are stored in the \nEEPROM array. When the EVENT pin ch anges states, the 2-wire bus is \nunavailable for communications for t\nEW (falling) and t ER (rising). The EVENT input \nis also deglitched (t G) to prevent short noise spikes from triggering an event. \n2, 7 N.C. No Connect. This pin is not connected internally. \n3 ALARM Active-Low Alarm Output. The DS1682 monito rs the values in the ETC for the \nprogrammed value in the alarm register. When the ETC matches the alarm value, the alarm flag (AF) is set. Once set, the alarm flag cannot be reset. See the \noperating descriptions for the AOS and AP bits for details about the operation of \nthe ALARM  pin. \n4 GND Ground \n5 SCL 2-Wire Serial-Clock Input. The SCL pin is  the serial-clock input for the 2-wire \nsynchronous communications channel. The SC L pin is an input that requires an \nexternal pullup resistor. \n6 SDA 2-Wire Input/Output. The SDA pin is the da ta input/output signal for the 2-wire \nsynchronous communications channel. The SDA pin is an open-drain I/O, which \nrequires an external pullup resistor. \n8 V CC +2.5V to +5.5V Input Supply \n OSCILLATOR \nAND \nDIVIDER  \nCONTROL \nLOGIC \nAND \nEVENT \nGLITCH \nFILTER  EVENT COUNTERSERIAL \nINTERFACE \nUSER, CONTROL, AND \nCONFIGURATION \nREGISTERS \nEVENT  SDA SCL \nALARM ALARM REGS \nAND \nCOMPARE LOGIC  ELAPSED TIME\nCOUNTER (ETC)\nEEPROM ARRAY\nVCC Dallas \nSemiconductor \nDS1682\nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder with Alarm \n \n  \n3 of 14  OPERATION \nThe block diagram in Figure 1 shows the relationshi p between the major functional blocks, the serial \ninterface, and the EEPROM memory section of the DS1682. Upon power-up, the DS1682 transfers the \ncontents of the EEPROM into the c ounters and memory registers where the data can be read and written \nthrough the serial interface. The content of the counters and memory registers are written into the \nEEPROM memory when the EVENT pin transitions from a logic high to a logic low.   The DS1682 uses a calibrated, temperature-compensate d RC time base to increment an ETC while an \nevent is active. When the event becomes active, th e contents of the nonvolatile EEPROM are transferred \nto the ETC and event counter and the oscillator starts. As the event continues, the ETC is incremented in quarter-second increments. When the event becomes in active, the event counter is incremented and the \ncontents of the ETC and event counter  are written to the nonvolatile EEPROM. \n \nThe ALARM  output can be used to indicat e when the ETC has matched the value in the alarm register. \n \nThe DS1682 can be configured to prevent clearing th e alarm and the elapsed time and event counters. \nThe user memory can be separately write-protected.  User-modified data is not stored in EEPROM until an event becomes inactive. \n \nFigure 2 shows the DS1682 measuring total run time and operating from a battery with the alarm tied to \nan LED and a pushbutton switch to trigger the alarm output. \n \nFigure 2. Total Run Time  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3 shows the DS1682 in a total time-of-use app lication where power may be removed at the same \ntime as the end of the event. The V CC slew rate at power-down is fast with respect to t EW. A capacitor \nmaintains V CC on the DS1682 above 2.5V until the EEPROM write  completes. A Schottky diode blocks \ncurrent from the capacitor to other devices connected to V CC. \n \nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder with Alarm \n \n  \n4 of 14  The V CC holding capacitor value of 30µF is calculated using the maximum EEPROM write current and \nEEPROM write time. This assumes that the V CC slew rate allows time from EVENT trip point to V CC at \n2.5V on the DS1682 is at least t EW. \n Figure 4 shows the DS1682 in a total time-of-use application with power that can be removed at the same time as the end of the event. In this application, the V\nCC slew rate at power-down is slow with respect to \ntEW. The external RST IC ends the event as V CC begins to drop. V CC must remain above 2.5V until the \nend of t EW. \n \nFigure 3. Total Time-of-Use Application with Fast V CC Slew Rate \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

When an event triggers the \ninput by transitioning the EVENT pin from a low to a high level, the following occurs:  \n1) The RC oscillator starts. \n2) The alarm, ETC, and event counter are transferred from EEPROM to RAM. \n3) Note:  Reading the RAM during the transfer results in invalid data. \n4) After t ES, the ETC increments. An event greater than t G but less than t ES increments the event counter \nbut not the ETC (zero-length event). \n5) The ETC increments every TEI. The ETC holds time in quarter-second resolution. \n6) When the EVENT pin goes low, the event counter  increments, the oscillator stops, and the ETC and \nevent counter are transferred to EEPROM. The 2-wire bus is not available for t EW. \n The ETC stops counting and does not roll over once FFF FFFFFh, or approximately 34 years, is reached. \nSee Figure 5 for timing.\n \n \n \nFigure 5. Event Input Timing \n \n \n \n \nDEVICE SETUP \nOnce installed in a system, the DS1682 can be prog rammed to record events as required by the \napplication, and can be tested by generating events  and monitoring the results. Afterwards, it can be \n\x93locked\x94 to prevent alteration of the even t and alarm registers and the alarm condition. \n The following is a typical sequence:  1) Write the configuration register, alarm regist ers, and user memory to the desired values. \n2) Write-protect the alarm, ETC, and event counter registers with the write disable command if needed. \n3) Write-protect the user memory with the write-memory-disable command, if needed. \n4) Issue a reset (described in the Reset Command  section). \n The alarm, ETC and event counter registers, a nd user memory, once locked, cannot be changed. \n Upon reset, the ETC and event counter registers are cleared. The device clears the RE bit, and the configuration register becomes read- only. Additional resets are ignored.\n \nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder with Alarm \n \n  \n7 of 14  ALARM \nThe alarm register is a 32-bit register that holds  time in quarter-second resolution. When a nonzero \nnumber is programmed into the alarm register, the ALARM  function is enabled and the DS1682 monitors \nthe values in the ETC for the programmed value in the alarm register. When the ETC matches the alarm \nvalue, the alarm flag is set.  \nEEPROM ARRAY \nWhen power is applied, the contents of the EEPROM are transferred to the configuration register, alarm register, ETC, event counter, and user memory. When the event pin goes low, V\nCC must remain above \nVCC minimum for t EW to ensure the EEPROM is properly written. \n The EEPROM array for the ETC and the event counter  is made up of three banks. Each bank can be \nwritten a maximum of 50k times. The device switches  between banks based upon the value in the event \ncounter. Resetting the event counter before the count er reaches 50,000 will cause additional writes to the \nfirst bank, which can allow writes in excess of 50k. If the event counter is set to greater than 50k or 100k \nprior to reset, the device stays on the selected ba nk. This could result in write s in excess of 50k to one \nbank. \n The configuration and alarm registers and the user memory are held in one bank of EEPROM. Writes at \nthe end of an event only occur if the data has changed in one or more of those registers.  User-modified data in any of the registers is stored in EEPROM only if the data was written while an event was active and is stored when the event ends. \n \nEVENT COUNTER REGISTER \nThis 17-bit event counter register set provides the to tal number of data samples logged during the life of \nthe product up to 131,072 separate events. The event c ounter consists of 2 bytes of memory in the \nmemory map plus the event counter MSB bit (ECMSB ) in the configuration register. Once the event \ncounter reaches 1FFFFh, event counting stops.   \nRESET COMMAND \nIf RE is set to a 1, a reset occurs when a reset co mmand is sent through the 2-wire bus. A reset command \nis issued by writing 55h twice into memory location 1Dh. The writes need not be consecutive. Cycling \npower on V CC prior to the second write te rminates the reset sequence. \n Upon reset, the ETC and event counter registers are cleared. The AF, RE, and EC MSB bits are cleared by \nthe device, and the configuration register becomes read-only. The data are written to the EEPROM, and additional resets are ignored.  When a reset command is issued, no additional co mmand should be issued during the EEPROM write \ntime (t\nEW). \n \nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder with Alarm \n \n  \n8 of 14  CONFIGURATION REGISTER \n \nM S B        L S B\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0 \n0 AF WDF WMDF AOS RE AP ECMSB \n \nNote: The configuration register is not stored in EEPROM unt il an event becomes inactive. RE does not need to be \nstored in EEPROM to reset the device. \n \nBit 6: Alarm Flag (AF).  The alarm flag is set to a 1 when the ETC value matches the alarm register. \nOnce the AF bit is set to a 1, it cannot be set to a 0. This bit is read-only.  Bit 5: Write Disable Flag (WDF).  When the write disable command is written to AAh twice at memory \nlocation 1Eh, the WDF is set to a 1 and cannot be cleare d or reset. When WDF is set to a 1, the alarm, \nETC, and event counter registers are read-only. This b it is read-only. The writes need not be consecutive. \nCycling power on V\nCC prior to the second write te rminates the reset sequence. \n Bit 4: Write-Memory-Disable Flag (WMDF).  When the write-memory-disable command is written to \nF0h twice at memory location 1Fh, the WMDF is se t to a 1 and cannot be reset or cleared. Once the \nWMDF is set to a 1, the 10-byte user memory becomes read-only. This bit is read-only. The writes need not be consecutive. Cycling power on V\nCC prior to the second write te rminates the reset sequence. \n \nBit 3: Alarm Output Select (AOS).  If AOS is 0 and AF is true, the DS1682 activates the ALARM  \noutput during an event when AF become s true. The DS1682 also activates the ALARM  output by pulling \nthe pin low four times at power-up, at the start and end of an event, or when the ALARM  pin is pulled \nlow and released. This output mode can be used to flash an LED or to communicate with another device \nto indicate that an alarm has occurred. AP  has no affect on the output when AOS is 0. \n \nIf AOS is a 1 and AF is true, the ALARM  output is constant when the alarm is active. AP determines the \npolarity of the output. \n Bit 2: Reset Enable (RE).  The reset enable bit allows the device to be reset by enabling the reset \ncommand. The sections of the DS1682 that are reset ar e then dependent on the value in the WDF. With \nthe WDF set to 0 and the reset enable bit set to a 1, the reset command clears the ETC, EEPROM, and event counter. When the reset enable bit is  set to a 0, the rese t command is disabled. \n Bit 1: Alarm Polarity (AP).  When the alarm polarity bit in the configuration register is set to 0, the \nALARM  output is high impedance during the period that the value in the ETC is less than the alarm \nregister value. When the ETC matches the alarm value, the ALARM  pin is driven low. If the AP bit is set \nto a 1, the ALARM  output is driven low during the period that the ETC is less than the alarm value. \nWhen the ETC matches the alarm value, the ALARM  pin becomes high impedance. The AP bit has no \naffect if AOS is set to a 0. \n Bit 0: Event Counter MSB  (ECMSB).  This bit is read-only.\n \n \nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder with Alarm \n \n  \n9 of 14  USER MEMORY \nThere are 10 bytes of user-programmable, EEPROM me mory. Once the write-memory disable flag is set \nto 1, the memory becomes read-only. User memory is not stored in EEPROM until an event becomes inactive.  \n2-WIRE SERIAL DATA BUS \nThe DS1682 supports a bidirectional, 2-wire bus and da ta-transmission protocol. A device that sends data \nonto the bus is defined as a transmitter and a device receiving data, a receiver. The device that controls the message is called a master, and the devices controlled by the master are slaves. A master device that generates the serial clock (SCL), controls the bus access, and generates the START and STOP conditions \nmust control the bus. The DS1682 operates as a slave on the 2-wire bus. Connections to the bus are made \nthrough the open-drain I/O lines SDA and SCL.  The following bus protocol has been defined (Figure 6):  \n/g167/g32Data transfer can be initiated only when the bus is not busy. \n \n/g167/g32During data transfer, the data line must remain stable whenever the clock line is high. Changes in the data line while the clock line is high are interpreted as control signals. \n Accordingly, the following bus conditions have been defined:  Bus Not Busy : Both data and clock lines remain high. \n Start Data Transfer : A change in the state of the data line, from high to low, while the clock is high, \ndefines a START condition.  Stop Data Transfer : A change in the state of the data line, from low to high, while the clock line is high, \ndefines the STOP condition.  Data Valid : The state of the data line represents valid data when, after a STAR T condition, the data line \nis stable for the duration of the high period of th e clock signal. The data on the line must be changed \nduring the low period of the clock signal. Th ere is one clock pulse per bit of data. \n Each data transfer is initiated with a START c ondition and terminated with a STOP condition. The \nnumber of data bytes transferred between START and STOP conditions are not limited, and are determined by the master device. The information is transferred byte-wise and each receiver acknowledges with a ninth bit. Within the bus speci fications a standard mode  (100kHz clock rate) and a \nfast mode (400kHz clock rate) are defined.   Acknowledge : Each receiving device, when addressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge after it \nreceives each byte. The master device must generate an extra clock pulse, which is associated with this acknowledge bit.  A device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse in such a \nway that the SDA line is stable low during the high  period of the acknowledge-related clock pulse. Of \ncourse, setup and hold times must be considered. A master must signal an end-of-data to the slave by not \nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder with Alarm \n \n  \n10 of 14  generating an acknowledge bit on the last  byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this case, the \nslave must leave the data line high to enable  the master to generate the STOP condition. \n \nDepending upon the state of the R/ W bit, two types of data transfer are possible: \n \nData transfer from a master transmitter to a slave receiver.  The first byte transmitted by the master is \nthe slave address. Next follows a number of data by tes. The slave returns an acknowledge bit after each \nreceived byte.  Data transfer from a slave transmitter to a master receiver. The master transmits the first byte (the \nslave address). The slave then returns an acknowledge bit. Next follows a number of data bytes transmitted by the slave to the master. The master returns an acknowledge bit after all received bytes \nother than the last byte. A \x93not acknowledge\x94 is re turned at the end of the last received byte. \n The master device generates all of the serial clock pulses and the START and STOP conditions. A \ntransfer is ended with a STOP condition or with a repeated STAR T condition. Since a repeated START \ncondition is also the beginning of the next serial transfer, the bus is not released. \n \n \nFigure 6. Timing Diagram: Data Transfer on 2-Wire Serial Bus \n \n \n \nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder with Alarm \n \n  \n11 of 14  The DS1682 can operate in the following two modes: \n Slave Receiver Mode (Write Mode): Serial data and clock are receiv ed through SDA and SCL. After \neach byte is received, the receiver transmits an  acknowledge bit. START and STOP conditions are \nrecognized as the beginning and end of a serial transfer. The slave address byte is the first byte received after the master generates a START condition. The a ddress byte contains th e 7-bit DS1682 address, \nwhich is 1101011, followed by the direction bit (R/ W). The second byte from the master is the register \naddress. This sets the register pointer. The master  then transmits each byte of data, with the DS1682 \nacknowledging each byte received. The register pointer  increments after each byte is written. The master \ngenerates a STOP condition to terminate the data write (Figure 7).  Slave Transmitter Mode (Read Mode):  The first byte is received and handled as in the slave receiver \nmode. However, in this mode, the direction bit indicates that the transfer direction is reversed. Serial data is transmitted on SDA by the DS1682 while the serial cloc k is input on SCL. The slave address byte is the \nfirst byte received after the master generates a START condition. The address byte contains the 7-bit \nDS1682 address, followed by the direction bit (R/ W). After receiving a valid slave address byte and \ndirection bit, the DS1682 generates an acknowledg e on the SDA line. The DS1682 begins to transmit \ndata on each SCL pulse starting with the register address pointed to by the register pointer. As the master reads each byte, it must generate an acknowledge. The re gister pointer increments after each byte is read. \nThe DS1682 must receive a \x93not acknowledge\x94 on the last byte to end a read (Figure 8).\n \n \n \nFigure 7.
