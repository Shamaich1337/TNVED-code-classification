A single RC network is all that is required to set up anyfull scale (FS) frequency up to 500 kHz and any FS input voltageup to –30 V. Linearity error is only 0.03% for a 250 kHz FS,\nand operation is guaranteed over an 80 dB dynamic range. Theoverall temperature coefficient (excluding the effects of externalcomponents) is typically \n –50 ppm/°C. The AD654 operates from\na single supply of 5 V to 36 V and consumes only 2.0 mA quies-cent current.\nThe low drift (4 mV/°C typ) input amplifier allows operation\ndirectly from small signals such as thermocouples or strain gauges\nwhile offering a high (250 M W) input resistance. Unlike most\nV/F converters, the AD654 provides a square-wave output, andcan drive up to 12 TTL loads, optocouplers, long cables, orsimilar loads.\nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1. Packaged in both an 8-lead mini-DIP and an 8-lead SOIC\npackage, the AD654 is a complete V/F converter requiringonly an RC timing network to set the desired full-scale fre-quency and a selectable pull-up resistor for the open-collector\noutput stage. Any full scale input voltage range from 100 mVto 10 volts (or greater, depending on +V\nS) can be accommo-\ndated by proper selection of the timing resistor. The full-scale frequency is then set by the timing capacitor from thesimple relationship, f = V/10 RC.2. A minimum number of low cost external components are\nnecessary. A single RC network is all that is required to setup any full scale frequency up to 500 kHz and any full-scaleinput voltage up to –30 V.\n3. Plastic packaging allows low cost implementation of the\nstandard VFC applications: A/D conversion, isolated signaltransmission, F/V conversion, phase-locked loops, and tuningswitched-capacitor filters.\n4. Power supply requirements are minimal; only 2.0 mA of\nquiescent current is drawn from the single positive supplyfrom 4.5 volts to 36 volts. In this mode, positive inputs canvary from 0 volts (ground) to (+V\nS –4) volts. Negative inputs\ncan easily be connected for below ground operation.\n5. The versatile open-collector output stage can sink more than\n10 mA with a saturation voltage less than 0.4 volts. The LogicCommon terminal can be connected to any level betweenground (or –V\nS) and 4 volts below +V S. This allows easy\ndirect interface to any logic family with either positive ornegative logic levels.FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM\n3 2 15 8 7 6\nAD654\n4DRIVER OSC\nFOUTLOGIC\nCOMMONRT+VIN+VS CT CT–VS\n2013\n781/461.3113\nC\n–2– REV.

CIRCUIT OPERATION\nThe AD654’s block diagram appears in Figure 1. A versatile\noperational amplifier serves as the input stage; its purpose is toconvert and scale the input voltage signal to a drive current in theNPN follower. Optimum performance is achieved when, at thefull-scale input voltage, a 1 mA drive current is delivered to thecurrent-to-frequency converter (an astable multivibrator). Thedrive current provides both the bias levels and the charging currentto the externally connected timing capacitor. This “adaptive” bias\nscheme allows the oscillator to provide low nonlinearity overthe entire current input range of 100 nA to 2 mA. The square\nwave oscillator output goes to the output driver which providesa floating base drive to the NPN power transistor. This floatingdrive allows the logic interface to be referenced to a level otherthan –V\nS.\nOSC/\nDRIVER\nAD654OPTIONAL\nRCOMP\nCR1\n–VS\n(0V TO –15V )R1\nR2VIN+VS\n(+5V TO –V S +30) CT+VLOGIC\nRPU\nFOUT\nFOUT =VIN\n(10V) (R1 + R2) C T\nFigure 1. Standard V-F Connection for Positive Input\nVoltages\nV/F CONNECTION FOR POSITIVE INPUT VOLTAGES\nIn the connection scheme of Figure 1, the input amplifier presents\na very high (250 M W) impedance to the input voltage, w hich\nis converted into the proper drive current by the scaling resistorsat Pin 3. Resistors R1 and R2 are selected to provide a 1 mAfull-scale current with enough trim range to accommodate theAD654’s 10% FS error and the components’ tolerances. F ull-\nscale currents other than 1 mA can be chosen, but linearity will\nbe reduced; 2 mA is the maximum allowable drive. The AD654’spositive input voltage range spans from –V\nS (ground in sink supply\noperation) to four volts below the positive supply. Power sup-\nply rejection degrades as the input exceeds (+V S – 3.75 V) and at\n(+V S – 3.5 V) the output frequency goes to zero.\nAs indicated by the scaling relationship in Figure 1, a 0.01 mF\ntiming capacitor will give a 10 kHz full-scale frequency, and0.001 mF will give 100 kHz with a 1 mA drive current. Good V/F\nlinearity requires the use of a capacitor with low dielectricabsorption (DA), w hile the most stable operation over tempera-\nture calls for a component having a small tempco. Polystyrene,polypropy lene, or Teflon* capacitors are preferred for tempco and\ndielectric absorption; other types will degrade linearity. Thecapacitor should be wired very close to the AD654. In Figure 1,\nSchottky diode CR1 (MBD101) prevents logic common fromdropping more than 500 mV below –V\nS. This diode is not\nrequired if –V S is equal to logic common.V/F CONNECTIONS FOR NEGATIVE INPUT VOLTAGE\nOR CURRENT\nThe AD654 can accommodate a wide range of negative input\nvoltages with proper selection of the scaling resistor, as indicatedin Figure 2. This connection, unlike the buffered positive con-nection, is not high impedance because the signal source mustsupply the 1 mA FS drive current. However, large negative volt-ages beyond the supply can be handled easily by modifying thescaling resistors appropriately. If the input is a true current source,R1 and R2 are not used. Again, diode CR1 prevents latch-up byinsuring Logic Common does not drop more than 500 mV below–V\nS. The clamp diode (MBD101) protects the AD654 input\nfrom “below –V S” inputs.\nOSC/\nDRIVER\nAD654OPTIONAL\nRCOMP\nCR1\n–VS\n(0V TO –15V)R1 R2+VS\n(+5V TO –V S +30) CT+VLOGIC\nRPU\nFOUT\nFOUT =VIN\n(10V) (R1 + R2) C T\nVIN\nCLAMP\nDIODE\nFigure 2. V-F Connections for Negative Input Voltages or\nCurrent\nOFFSET CALIBRATION\nIn theory, two adjustments calibrate a V/F: scale and offset. Inpractice, most applications find the AD654’s 1 mV max voltageoffset sufficiently low to forgo offset calibration. However, theinput amplifier’s 30 nA (typ) bias currents will generate an offset\ndue to the difference in dc sound resistance between the inputterminals. This offset can be substantial for large values of R\nT =\nR1 + R2 and will vary as the bias currents drift over temperature.Therefore, to maintain the AD654’s low offset, the application mayrequire balancing the dc source resistances at the inputs (Pins3 and 4).\nFor positive inputs, this is accomplished by adding a compensation\nresistor nominally equal to R\nT in series with the input as shown\nin Figure 3a. This limits the offset to the product of the 30 nAbias current and the mismatch between the source resistance R\nT\nand R COMP . A second, smaller offset arises from the inputs’ 5 nA\noffset current flowing through the source resistance R T or R COMP.\nFor negative input voltage and current connections, the compensa-tion resistor is added at Pin 4 as shown in Figure 3b in lieu ofgrounding the pin directly. For both positive and negative inputs,the use of R\nCOMP  may lead to noise coupling at Pin 4 and should\ntherefore be bypassed for lowest noise operation.\nR1 R2VIN\nRCOMPAD654(OPTIONAL)\nC\nFigure 3a.

Figure 3c shows anoptional connection for positive inputs in which R\nOFF1 and\nROFF2 add a variable resistance in series with R T. A variable\nsource of –0.6 V applied to R OFF1 then adjusts the offset –1 mV.\nSimilarly, a –0.6 V variable source is applied to R OFF in Fig-\nure 3d to trim offset for negative inputs. The –0.6 V bipolar\nsource could simply be an AD589 reference connected as shownin Figure 3e.\nVIN10kVAD654\n5kV8.25kVROFF2\n20V\nROFF1\n10kV\n60.6V\nFigure 3c.

Offset Trim Bias Network\nFULL-SCALE CALIBRATION\nFull-scale trim is the calibration of the circuit to produce thedesired output frequency with a full-scale input applied. In mostcases this is accomplished by adjusting the scaling resistor R\nT.\nPrecise calibration of the AD654 requires the use of an accuratevoltage standard set to the desired FS value and an accuratefrequency meter. A scope is handy for monitoring output wave-shape. Verification of converter linearity requires the use of aswitchable voltage source or DAC having a linearity error below–0.005%, and the use of long measurement intervals to mini-\nmize count uncertainties. Since each AD654 is factory tested forlinearity, it is unnecessary for the end-user to perform this tedious\nand time consuming test on a routine basis.\nSufficient FS calibration trim range must be provided to accom-\nmodate the worst-case sum of all major scaling errors. Thisincludes the AD654’s 10% full-scale error, the tolerance of the\nfixed scaling resistor, and the tolerance of the timing capacitor.Therefore, with a resistor tolerance of 1% and a capacitor toleranceof 5%, the fixed part of the scaling resistor should be a maximumof 84% of nominal, with the variable portion selected to allow116% of the nominal.\nIf the input is in the form of a negative current source, the scaling\nresistor is no longer required, eliminating the capability of trim-\nming FS frequency in this fashion. Since it is u sually not practical\nto smoothly vary the capacitance for trimming purposes, analternative scheme such as the one shown in Figure 4 is needed.Designed for a FS of 1 mA, this circuit divides the input into two\nAD654\nROFF\n100kVR4\n392V R3\n1kV\n60.6V*\n*OPTIONALOFFSET TRIMf =I\nS\n(20V) CTIR\n–V1mAFSISR2\n100V\nR1\n100V\nFigure 4. Current Source FS Trim\nand flowing into Pin 3; it constitutes the signal current I T to be\nconverted. The second path, through another 100 W resistor R2,\ncarries the same nominal current. Two equal valued resistors\noffer the best overall stability, and should be either 1% discretefilm units, or a pair from a common array.\nSince the 1 mA FS input current is divided into two 500 mA legs\n(one to ground and one to Pin 3), the total input signal current\n(I\nS) is divided by a factor of two in this network. To achieve the\nsame conversion scale factor, C T must be reduced by a factor of\ntwo. This results in a transfer unique to this hookup:\n    f=IS\n(20V)CT\nFor calibration purposes, resistors R3 and R4 are added to the\nnetwork, allowing a –15% trim of scale factor with the values\nshown. By varying R4’s value the trim range can be modified toaccommodate wider tolerance components or perhaps the cali-bration tolerance on a current output transducer such as theAD592 temperature sensor. Although the values of R1–R4 shownare valid for 1 mA FS signals only, they can be scaled upwardproportionately for lower FS currents. For instance, they should\nbe increased by a factor of ten for a FS cu rrent of 100 mA.\nIn addition to the offsets generated by the input amplifier’s biasand offset currents, an offset voltage induced parasitic currentarises from the current fork input network. These effects areminimized by using the bias current compensation resistor R\nOFF\nand offset trim scheme shown in Figure 3e.\nAlthough device warm-up drifts are small, it is good practice to\nallow the devices operating environment to stabilize before trim,\nC\nAD654\n–6– REV. and insure the supply, source and load are appropriate. If pr ovision\nis made to trim offset, begin by setting the input to 1/10,000 of\nfull scale. Adjust the offset pot until the output is 1/10,000 offull scale (for example, 25 Hz for a FS of 250 kHz). This is mosteasily accomplished using a frequency meter connected to theoutput. The FS input should then be applied and the gain potshould be adjusted until the desired FS frequency is indicated.\nINPUT PROTECTION\nThe AD654 was designed to be used with a minimum of additionalhardware. However, the successful application of a precision ICinvolves a good understanding of possible pitfalls and the use ofsuitable precautions. Thus +V\nIN and R T pins should not be driven\nmore than 300 mV below –V S. Likewise, Logic Common should\nnot drop more than 500 mV below –V S. This would cause inter-\nnal junctions to conduct, possibly damaging the IC. In additionto the diode shown in Figures 1 and 2 protecting Logic Common,a second Schottky diode (MBD101) can protect the AD654’sinputs from “below –V\nS’’ inputs as shown in Figure 5. It is also\ndesirable not to drive +V IN and R T above +V S. In operation, the\nconverter will exhibit a zero output for inputs above (+V S – 3.5 V).\nAlso, control currents above 2 mA will increase nonlinearity.\nThe AD654’s 80 dB dynamic range guarantees operation from a\ncontrol current of 1 mA (nominal FS) down to 100 nA (equiva-lent to 1 mV to 10 V FS). Below 100 nA improper operation ofthe oscillator may result, causing a false indication of inputamplitude. In m any cases this might be due to short-lived noise\nspikes which become added to input. For example, when scaledto accept an FS input of 1 V, the –80 dB level is only 100 mV, so\nwhen the mean input is only 60 dB below FS (1 mV), noise spikesof 0.9 mV are sufficient to cause momentary malfunction.\nThis effect can be minimized by using a sim ple low-pass filter\nahead of the converter or a guard ring around the R\nT pin. The\nfilter can be assembled using the bias current comp ensation\nresistor discussed in the previous section. For an FS of 10 kHz,\na single-pole filter with a time constant of 100 ms will be suitable,but the optimum configuration will depend on the applicationand the type of signal processing. Noise spikes are only likely tobe a cause of error when the input current remains near its mini-mum value for long periods of time; above 100 nA full integrationof additive input noise occurs. Like the inputs, the capacitorterminals are sensitive to interference from other signals. The\ntiming capacitor should be located as close as possible to theAD654 to m inimize signal pickup in the leads. In some cases,\nguard rings or shielding may be required.\nAD654\nMBD101IIN\nFigure 5. Input Protection\nDECOUPLING\nIt is good engineering practice to use bypass capacitors on thesupply-voltage pins and to insert small-valued resistors (10 to100 W) in the supply lines to provide a measure of decouplingbetween the various circuits in the system. Ceramic capacitorsof 0.1 mF to 1.0 mF should be applied between the supply-\nvoltage pins and analog signal ground for proper bypassing onthe AD654. A proper ground scheme appears in Figure 6.\n8\n17\n26\n35\n4AD654+5V\nGNDDIGITAL\nP.S.10V\n0.1mFCT\nRTRPU\nfOUT\nAGND\nVIN\nFigure 6. Proper Ground Scheme\nOUTPUT INTERFACING CONSIDERATION\nThe output stage’s design allows easy interfacing to all digital logicfamilies. The output NPN transistor’s emitter and collector areboth uncommitted. The emitter can be tied to any voltage between–V\nS and 4 volts below +V S, and the open collector can be pulled\nup to a voltage 36 volts above the emitter regardless of +V S. The\nhigh power output stage can sink over 10 mA at a maximumsaturation voltage of 0.4 V. The stage limits the output current\nat 25 mA and can handle this limit indefinitely without damag-ing the device.\nNONLINEARITY SPECIFICATION\nThe preferred method of specifying nonlinearity error is in termsof maximum deviation from the ideal relationship after calibrat-ing the converter at full scale. This error will vary with the fullscale frequency and the mode of operation. The AD654 operatesbest at a 150 kHz full-scale frequency with a negative voltage input;the linearity is typically within 0.05%. Operating at higher fre-quencies or with positive inputs will degrade the linearity asindicated in the Specifications Table. Typical linearity at varioustemperatures is shown in Figure 7.\nFULL-SCALE FREQUENCY – kHz10\n0.01\n10MAXIMUM NONLINEARITY – %1\n150 250 350 5005\n0.5\n0.10\n0.05fAMB = –408C\nfAMB = 08C TO +858C\nFigure 7.

The twisted pair transmission line serves the\ndual purpose of supplying power to the device and also carryingfrequency data in the form of current modulation.\nThe positive supply line is fed to the remote V/F through a\n140 W resistor. This resistor is selected such that the quiescent\ncurrent of the AD654 will cause less than one V\nBE to be dropped.\nAs the V/F oscillates, additional switched current is drawn throughR\nL when Pin 1 goes low. The peak level of this additional cur-\nrent causes Q1 to saturate, and thus regenerates the AD654’soutput square wave at the collector. The supply voltage to theAD654 then consists of a dc level, less the resistive line drop, plus aone V\nBE p-p square wave at the output frequency of the AD654.\nThis ripple is reduced by the diode/capacitor combination.\nTo set up the receiver circuit for a given voltage, the R S and R L\nresistances are selected as shown in Table I. CMOS logic stages\ncan be driven directly from the collector of Q1, and a single TTLload can be driven from the junction of R\nS and R6.\nTable I.\n+VS RS (V)R L (V)\n10 V 270 1.8k\n15 V 680 2.7k\nTable II.\n(+V S) R1 ( V) R2 ( V) R3 ( V) R4 ( V) R5 ( V)\nK10 V – – – 100k 127kF = 10 Hz/K\n15 V – – – 100k 127k\n°C10 V 6.49k 4.02k 1k 95.3k 22.6kF = 10 Hz/ °C\n15 V 12.7k 4.02k 1k 78.7k 36.5k\n°F10 V 6.49k 4.42k 1k 154k 22.6kF = 5.55 Hz/ °F\n15 V 12.7k 4.42k 1k 105k 36.5k\nAt the V/F end, the AD592C temperature transducer is inter-faced with the AD654 in such a manner that the AD654 outputfrequency is proportional to temperature. The output frequencycan be sealed and offset from K to °C or °F using the resistorvalues shown in Table II. Since temperature is the parameter ofinterest, an NPO ceramic capacitor is used as the timing capaci-tor for low V/F TC.\nWhen scaling per K, resistors R1–R3 and the AD589 voltage\nreference are not used. The AD592 produces a 1 mA/K current\noutput which drives Pin 3 of the AD654. With the timingcapacitor of 0.01 mF this produces an output frequency scaled to\n10 Hz/K. When scaling per °C and °F, the AD589 and resistors\nR1–R3 offset the drive current at Pin 3 by 273.2 mA for scaling\nper °C and 255.42 mA for scaling per °F. This will result in fre-\nquencies sealed at 10 Hz/ °C and 5.55 Hz/ °F, respectively.\nOPTOISOLATOR COUPLING\nA popular method of isolated signal coupling is via optoelec-tronic isolators, or optocouplers. In this type of device, the signal iscoupled from an input LED to an output photo-transistor, withlight as the connecting medium. This technique allows dc to betransmitted, is extremely useful in overcoming ground loopproblems between equipment, and is applicable over a widerange of speeds and power.\nFigure 9 shows a general purpose isolated V/F circuit using alow cost 4N37 optoisolator. A +5 V power supply is assumed forboth the isolated (+5 V isolated) and local (+5 V local) supplies.The input LED of the isolator is driven from the collector out-put of the AD654, with a 9 mA current level established by R1for high speed, as well as for a 100% current transfer ratio.\n5V\n(ISOLATED)\nR1\n390V4N37\nOPTO-ISOLATOR5V\n(LOCAL)\nGRN\nLED\nOSC/\nDRIVER\nRT\n1kVVIN\n(0V TO 1V)\nCT\n1000pFAD654R3270V\n74LS14\nQ12N3904R2120VV/F OUTPUT\nFS = 100kHz\nTTL\nISOLATED LOCAL\nFigure 9.

At the receiver side, the output transistor is operated in the\nphoto-transistor mode; that is with the base lead (Pin 6) open.This allows the highest possible output current. For reasonablespeed in this mode, it is imperative that the load impedance beas low as possible. This is provided by the single transistor stagecurrent-to-voltage converter, which has a dynamic load imped-ance of less than 10 ohms and interfaces with TTL at the output.\nUSING A STAND-ALONE FREQUENCY COUNTER/LED\nDISPLAY DRIVER FOR VOLTMETER APPLICATIONS\nFigure 10 shows the AD654 used with a stand-alone frequency\ncounter/LED display driver. With C T = 1000 pF and R T = 1 kW\nthe AD654 produces an FS frequency of 100 kHz when V IN =\n+1 V. This signal is fed into the ICM7226A, a universal countersystem that drives common anode LEDs. With the FUNCTIONpin tied to D1 through a 10 k W resistor the ICM7226A counts the\nfrequency of the signal at A\nIN. This count period is selected by\nthe user and can be 10 ms, 100 ms, 1s, or 10 seconds, as shown onPin 21. The longer the period selected, the more resolution thecount will have. The ICM7226A then displays the frequency onthe LEDs, driving them directly as shown. Refreshing of the LEDsis handled automatically by the ICM7226. The entire circuit op-erates on a single +5 V supply and gives a meter with 3, 4, or 5digit resolution.\n40\n39\n3837363534333231302928272625242322211\n23456789\n10111213141516171819208\n7651234\nVIN\n(0V TO 1V)5V 5V\n1kV\n1000pF 500V 825V\n1kVAD654\nDI PIN 3010kV30kV\n5V\n5V10MHz\nCRYSTAL\n22MV\n39pF 39pF\n5V 5V\n10kV5V\nD1 (10ms)\nD2 (100ms)\nD3 (1s)\nD4 (10s)4\n8\n8\nD.P. g e d c b a f\nLED\nOVERFLOW\nINDICATOR\nD8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1AIN\nHOLD\nNC\nOSL JN\nOSL OUT\nNC\nD1\nD2D3\nD4\nD5\nV+\nD6\nD7\nD8\nRANGEICM7226AFUNCTION\ndp\ne\ng\na\nGND\nd\nb\nc\nf+\n–\nNC = NO CONNECT\nFigure 10. AD654 With Stand-Alone Frequency Counter/\nLED Display DriverLonger count periods not only result in the count having more\nresolution, they also serve as an integration of noisy analog signals.For example, a normal-mode 60 Hz sine wave riding on the inputof the AD654 will result in the output frequency increasing onthe positive half of the sine wave and decreasing on the negativehalf of the sine wave. This effect is cancelled by selecting a countperiod equal to an integral number of noise signal periods. A100 ms count period is effective because it not only has an inte-gral number of 60 Hz cycles (6), it also has an integral numberof 50 Hz cycles (5). This is also true of the 1 second and 10 sec-ond count period.\nAD654-BASED ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERSION\nUSING A SINGLE CHIP MICROCOMPUTER\nThe AD654 can serve as an analog-to-digital converter when\nused with a single component microcomputer that has an inter-val timer/event counter such as the 8048. Figure 11 shows theAD654, with a full-scale input voltage of +1 V and a full-scaleoutput frequency of 100 kHz, connected to the timer/counterinput Pin T1 of the 8048. Such a system can also operate on asingle +5 V supply.\nThe 8748 counter is negative edge triggered; after the STRT\nCNT instruction is executed subsequent high to low transitionson T1 increment the counter. The maximum rate at which thecounter may be incremented is once per three instruction cycles;using a 6 MHz crystal, this corresponds to once every 7.5 ms, or\na maximum frequency of 133 kHz. Because the counter overflowsevery 256 counts (8 bits), the timer interrupt is enabled. Eachoverflow then causes a jump to a subroutine where a register isincremented. After the STOP TCNT instruction is executed, thenumber of overflows that have occurred will be the number inthis register. The number in this register multiplied by 256  plusthe number in the counter will be the total number of negativeedges counted during the count period. The count period ishandled sim ply by decrementing a register the number of times\nnecessary to correspond to the desired count time. After theregister has been decremented the required number of times the\nSTOP TCNT instruction is executed.\nThe total number of negative edges counted during the count\nperiod is proportional to the input voltage. For example, if a 1 Vfull-scale input voltage produces a 100 kHz signal and the countperiod is 100 ms, then the total count will be 10,000. Scalingfrom this maximum is then used to determine the input voltage,i.e., a count of 5000 corresponds to an input voltage of 0.5 V.As with the ICM7226, longer count times result in counts hav-ing more resolution; and they result in the integration of noisyanalog signals.\nC\nAD654\nREV. –9–8\n7651234\nAD654\n1kV\nVIN\n(0V TO 1V)1000pF5V\n10kV\n825V\n1%\n500V\nAD+\n–6MHz20pF\n20pF\n1mFXTAL1\nXTAL2\nRESET\nEA\nSS\nINT\nT0\nT1P10\nP17\nP20\nP27\nDB0\nDB7PORT 1\nPORT 2\nBUS\nPORTVCCVDDVSS5V GND\nALE PSENPROG WR RD8048\nNC\nNC NC\nNC = NO CONNECT\nFigure 11.  AD654 VFC as an ADCFREQUENCY DOUBLING\nSince the AD654’s output is a square-wave rather than a pulse\ntrain, information about the input signal is carried on bothhalves of the output waveform. The circuit in Figure 12 convertsthe output into a pulse train, effectively doubling the ou tput\nfrequency, while preserving the better low frequency linearity ofthe AD654. This circuit also accommodates an input voltagethat is greater than the AD654 supply voltage.\nResistors R1–R3 are used to scale the 0 V to +10 V input voltagedown to 0 V to +1 V as seen at Pin 4 of the AD654. Recall thatV\nIN must be less than V SUPPLY  –4 V, or in this case less than 1 V.\nThe timing resistor and capacitor are selected such that this 0 Vto +1 V signal seen at Pin 4 results in a 0 kHz to 200 kHz outputfrequency.\nThe use of R4, C1 and the XOR gate doubles this 200 kHz\noutput frequency to 400 kHz. The AD654 output transistor isbasically used as a switch, switching capacitor C1 between acharging mode and a discharging mode of operation. The voltagesseen at the input of the 74LS86 are shown in the waveform dia-gram. Due to the difference in the charge and discharge timeconstants, the output pulse widths of the 74LS86 are not equal.The output pulse is wider when the capacitor is charging due toits longer rise time than fall time. The pulses should therefore becounted on their rising, rather than falling, edges.\nAD654\nRT\n1kV CT\n500pFRPU\n2.87kV\nR3\n1kVR2\n2kVR1\n8.06kV\nC1\n1000pFR4\n1kV5V\nA\nBC74LS86\nVIN\n(0V TO 10V)V/F OUTPUT\nFS = 400MHz\nOFF\nON\nV\n0\nV\n0\n5\n0TRANSISTOR\nA\nB\nC\nWAVEFORM DIAGRAMOSC/\nDRIVER\nFigure 12.

Although the output stage may becomespeed lim ited, the multivibrator core itself is able to oscillate to\n1 MHz or more. The designer may take advantage of this feature inorder to operate the device at frequen cies in excess of 500 kHz.\nFigure 13 illustrates this with a circuit offering 2 MHz full scale.In this circuit the AD654 is operated at a full scale (FS) of 1 mA,with a C\nT of 100 pF. This achieves a basic device FS frequency\nof 1 MHz across C T. The P channel JFETs, Q1 and Q2, buffer\nthe differential timing capacitor waveforms to a low impedancelevel where the push -pull signal is then ac coupled to the high speed\ncomparator A2. Hysteresis is used, via R7, for nonambiguousswitching and to eliminate the oscillations which w ould other-\nwise occur at low frequencies.\nThe net result of this is a very high speed circuit which does not\ncompromise the AD654 dynamic range. This is a result of the FETbuffers typically having only a few pA of bias current. The highend dynamic range is limited, however, by parasitic package andlayout capacitances in shunt with C\nT, as well as those from each node\nto ac ground. Minimizing the lead length between A2–6/A2–7 andQ1/Q2 in PC layout will help. A ground plane will also helpstability. F igure 14 shows the waveforms V1–V4 found at the\nrespective points shown in Figure 13.The output of the comparator is a complementary square waveat 1 MHz FS. Unlike pulse train output V/F converters, eachhalf-cycle of the AD654 output conveys information about theinput. Thus it is possible to count edges, rather than full cyclesof the output, and double the effective output frequency. TheXOR gate following A2 acts as an edge detector producing a shortpulse for each input state transition. This effectively doubles theV/F FS frequency to 2 MHz. The final result is a 1 V full-scaleinput V/F with a 2 MHz full-scale output capability; typicalnonlinearity is 0.5%.\n100\n90\n10\n0%500ns\n2V 5V2V 5V\n2V\n0\n2V\n0\n5V\n0\n5V\n0V1\nV2\nV3\nV4\nFigure 14.
