Small Signal Res ponse for Various Gains  \nGENERAL DESCRIPTON  \nThe AD8137 is a low cost differential driver with a rail -to-rail \noutp ut that is ideal for driving ADCs in systems that are sensitive \nto power and cost. The AD8137  is easy to apply, and its internal \ncommon -mode feedback architecture allows its output common -\nmode voltage to be controlled by the voltage applied to one pin. \nThe internal feedback loop also provides inherently b alanced \noutputs as well as suppression of even -order harmonic distortion  \nproducts. Fully differential and single -ended- to-differential gain \nconfigurations are easily realized by the AD8137. External \nfeedback  networks consisting of four resistor s determine the closed -loop gain  of the amplifier . The power -down feature is \nbeneficial in critical low power applications.   \nThe AD8137 is manufactured on Analog Devices , Inc., \nproprietary second -generation XFCB process, enabling it to \nachieve high levels of performance with very low power \nconsumption.  \nThe AD8137 is available in the  small 8 -lead SOIC package and \n3 mm × 3  mm LFCSP pack age. It is rated to operate over the \nextended industrial temperature range of − 40°C to +125°C.  \n \nAD8137 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

At approximately 150°C, which is the glass transition \ntemperature, the plastic changes its properties. Even temporarily  \nexceeding this temperature limit may change the stresses that \nthe package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric  \nperformance of the AD8137. Exceeding a junction temperature \nof 175°C for an extended period can result in changes in the \nsilicon devices, potentially causing failure.  \n The power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the  \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the \npackage due to the load drive for all outputs. The quiescent power is the voltage between the supply pins (V\nS) times the \nquiescent current (I S). The load current consists of differ ential \nand common -mode currents flowing to the load, as well as  \ncurrents flowing through the external feedback networks and the internal common -mode feedback loop. The internal resistor \ntap used in the common -mode feedback loop places a 1 kΩ \ndifferential load on the output. RMS output voltages should be \nconsidered when dealing with ac signals. \nAirflow reduces θ\nJA. In addition , more metal directly in contact \nwith the package leads from metal traces, through holes, ground,  \nand power planes reduces the θ JA. \nFigure 3 shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage vs. the ambient temperature for the 8 -lead SOIC \n(125°C/W) and 8-lead LFCSP ( θJA = 70°C/W) on a JEDEC \nstandard 4-layer board. θ JA values are approximations.  \n–40 –20–10 –30 01020304050607080901001101203.0MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)1.01.5\n0.52.02.5\n0\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE ( °C)SOIC-8LFCSP\n04771-0-022\n \nFigur e 3.

E | Page 22 of 32 THEORY OF OPE RATION  \nThe AD8137 is a low power, low cost, fully differential voltage \nfeedback amplifier that features a rail -to-rail output stage, \ncommon -mode circuitry with an internally derived common -\nmode reference volta ge, and bias shutdown circuitry. The amplifier  \nuses two feedback loops to separately control differential and \ncommon -mode feedback. The differential gain is set with external  \nresistors as in a traditional amplifier , and the output common -\nmode voltage is se t by an internal feedback loop, controlled by \nan external V OCM input. This architecture makes it easy to set \narbitrarily the output common -mode voltage level without \naffecting the differential gain of the amplifier.  \n–OUT +INACMVOCM\nCC CCCP +OUT –INCN\n04771-0-017 \nFigure 62. Block Diagram \nFrom Figure 62, the input transconductance stage is an H -bridge  \nwhose output current is mirrored to high impedance nodes CP and CN. The output section is traditional H -bridge driven circuitry  \nwith common emitter de vices driving nodes +OUT and −OUT. \nThe 3 dB point of the amplifier is defined as  \nCm\nCgBW×π=2 \nwhere:  \n gm is the transconductance of the input stage .  \nCC is the total capacitance on node CP/CN (capacitances CP \nand CN are well matched).  \nFor the AD8137, the input stage g m is ~1  mA/V and the \ncapacitance  CC is 3.5 pF, setting the crossover frequency of the \namplifier at 41 MHz. This frequency generally establishes an \namplifier’s unity gain bandwidth, but wi th the AD8137, the \nclosed -loop bandwidth depends upon the feedback resistor \nvalue as well (see Figure 17). The open -loop gain and phase \nsimulations are shown in Figure 63.

Open -Loop Gain and Phase   \nIn Figure 62, the common -mode feedback amplifier A CM \nsamples the output common -mode voltage, and by negative \nfeedback forces the output common -mode voltage to be equal \nto the voltage applied to the V OCM input. In other words, the \nfeedback loop servos the output common -mode voltage to the \nvoltage applied to the V OCM input. An internal bias generator \nsets the V OCM level to approximately midsupply;  therefore, the \noutput common -mode voltage is set  to approximately midsupply  \nwhen the V OCM input is left floating. The source resistance of the \ninternal bias generator is large and can be overridden easily by an external voltage supplied by a source with a  relatively small output  \nresistance. The V\nOCM input can  be driven to within approximately  \n1 V of the supply rails while maintaining linear operation in the \ncommon -mode feedback loop.  \nThe common -mode feedback loop inside the AD8137 produces \noutputs that are highly balanced over a wide frequency range \nwithout the requirement of tightly matched external components,  \nbecause it forces the signal component of the output common -\nmode voltage to be zeroed. The result is nearly perfectly balanced  \ndifferential outputs of identical amplitude and exactly 180°  \napart in ph ase. \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD8137 \n \nRev.

The differential input  \nterminals of the AD8137, V AP and V AN, are used as summing \njunctions. An external reference voltage applied to the V OCM \nterminal sets the output common -mode voltage. The two  \noutput terminals, V OP and V ON, move in opposite directions  \nin a balanced fashion in response to an input signal.  \n04771-0-055+\n–VAP\nVANVON\nVOP–\n+VO, dm RL, dm AD8137CF\nRF\nRG\nRG\nCFRFVIP\nVOCM\nVIN\n \nFigure 64. Typical Connection  \nThe differential output voltage is defined as  \nVO, dm = V OP − V ON (1) \nCommon -mode voltage is the average of two voltages. The  \noutput common -mode voltage is defined as  \n2,ON OP\ncmOV VV+=  (2) \nOutput Ba lance  \nOutput balance is a measure of how well V OP and V ON are \nmatched in amplitude and how precisely they are 180° out of \nphase with each other. It is the internal common -mode feedback  \nloop that forces the signal component of the output common -\nmode toward zero, resulting in the near perfectly balanced \ndifferential outputs of identical amplitude and are exactly 180° \nout of phase. The output balance performance does not require \ntightly matched external components, nor does it require that \nthe feedback factors  of each loop be equal to each other. Low \nfrequency output balance is ultimately limited by  the mismatch \nof an on -chip voltage divider.  Output balance is measured by placing a well -matched resistor \ndivider across the differential voltage outputs and compa ring \nthe signal at the divider’s midpoint with the magnitude of the differential output. By this definition, output balance is equal to \nthe magnitude of the change in output common -mode voltage \ndivided by the magnitude of the change in output differential  \nmode voltage:  \ndmOcmO\nVV\nBalance Output\n,,\n∆∆\n=  (3) \nThe differ ential negative feedback drives the voltages at the summing  \njunctions V AN and V AP to be essentially equal to each other.  \nVAN = VAP (4) \nThe common -mode feedback loop drives the output common -\nmode voltage, s ampled at the midpoint of the two internal \ncommon -mode tap resistors in Figure 62, to equal the voltage \nset at the V OCM terminal.

E | Page 24 of 32 The differential output voltage noise contains contributions \nfrom the AD8137’s input voltage noise and input current noise \nas well as those from the  external feedback networks.  \nThe contribution from the input voltage noise spectral density \nis computed as  \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=\nGF\nnRRv Vo_n 1 1 , or equivalently, v n/β (7) \nwhere vn is defined as the input -referred differential voltage \nnoise.

For a balanced differential input, the gain from \nVIN, dm to V O, dm is also equal to R F/RG, where V IN, dm = V IP − V IN. Feedback Factor Notation  \nWhen working with differential drivers, it is convenient to \nintroduce the feedback factor β , which is def ined as  \nG FG\nR RR\n+≡β  (14) \nThis notation is consistent with conventional feedback analysis \nand is very useful, particularly when the two feedback loops are \nnot matched.  \nInput Common -Mode Voltage  \nThe linear range of the V AN and V AP terminals extend s to within \napproximately 1 V of either supply rail. Because  VAN and V AP are \nessentially equal to each other, they are both equal to the amplifier’s  \ninput common -mode voltage. Their range is indicated in the \nspecifications tables as input common -mode range .

For balanced differential input \nsignals, the differential input impedance (R IN, dm) is simply  \nRIN, dm = 2RG (18) \nFor a single -ended signal (for example, when V IN is grounded \nand the input signal drives V IP), the input impedance becomes  \n) (21\nF GFG\nIN\nR RRRR\n+−=  (19) \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD8137 \n \nRev.

AD8137 Driving AD7450A, 12- Bit AD C  \nThe input impedance of a conventional inverting op amp \nconfiguration is simply R G; however, it is higher in Equation 19 \nbecause a fraction of the differential ou tput voltage appears at \nthe summing junctions, V AN and V AP. This voltage partially \nbootstraps the voltage across the input resistor R G, leading to \nthe increased input resistance.  \nInput Common -Mode Swing Considerations  \nIn some single -ended -to-differential a pplications , when using a \nsingle -supply voltage, attention must be paid to the swing of the \ninput common -mode voltage, V ACM.  \nConsider the case in Figure 65, where V IN is 5 V p -p swinging \nabout a baseline at ground and V REFB is connected to ground. \nThe input signal to the AD8137  is originating from a source \nwith a very low output resistance.  \nThe circuit has a differential gain of 1.0 and β  = 0.5. V ICM has an \namplitude of 2.5 V p -p and is swinging about ground. Using the \nresults in Equation 16, the common -mode voltage at the inputs  of \nthe AD8137, V ACM, is a 1.25 V p -p signal swinging about a baseline \nof 1.25 V . The maximum negative excursion of V ACM in this case is \n0.63 V , which exceeds the lower input common -mode voltage limit.  \nOne way to avoid the input common -mode swing limitation is \nto bias V IN and V REF at midsupply. In this case, V IN is 5 V p -p \nswinging about a baseline at 2.5 V , and V REF is connected to a \nlow-Z 2.5 V source. V ICM now has an amplitude of 2.5 V p -p and \nis swinging about 2.5 V . Using the results in Equation 17, V ACM \nis calculated t o be equal to V ICM because VOCM = V ICM. Therefore, \nVICM swings from 1.25 V to 3.75 V , which is well within the input  \ncommon -mode voltage limits of the AD8137. Another benefit \nseen by this example is that becaus e VOCM = V ACM = V ICM, no \nwasted common -mode current flows. Figure 66 illustrates a way \nto provide the low- Z bias voltage. For situations that do not \nrequire a precise reference, a simple voltage divider suffices to \ndevelop the input voltage to the buffer.  \n04771-0-019VIN\n0V TO 5VAD8137+\n–8\n2\n1\n63\n45\nVOCM1kΩ1kΩ5V\n1kΩ 1kΩ\n10kΩ0.1µF\n0.1µF\n0.1µF10µF+\nAD8031+\n–0.1µF5V\nADR525A\n2.5V SHUNT\nREFERENCETO\nAD7450AV\nREF\n \nFigure 66. Low -Z Bias Source  \nAnother way to avoid the input common- mode swing limitation \nis to use dual power supplies on the AD8137. In this case, the \nbiasing circuitry is not required.  \nBandwidth vs. Closed -Loop Gain  \nThe 3 dB bandwidth of the AD8137 decreases proportionally  \nto increasing closed -loop gain in the same way as a traditional \nvoltage feedback operat ional amplifier. For closed -loop gains \ngreater than 4, the bandwidth obtained for a specific gain can  \nbe estimated as  \n) MHz72( ,3 ×+=−\nF GG\ndmO, dBR RRV f  (20) \nor equivalently, β(72 MHz).  \nThis estimate assumes a minimum 90° phase margin for the \namplifier loop, a condit ion approached for gains greater than 4. \nLower gains show more bandwidth than predicted by the equation  \ndue to the peaking produced by the lower phase margin.  \nAD8137 Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 26 of 32 Estimating DC Errors  \nPrimary differential output offset errors in the AD8137 are due \nto three major components: the input offset voltage, the offset \nbetween the V AN and V AP input currents interacting with the \nfeedback network resistances, and the offset produced by the  \ndc voltage difference between the in put and output common -\nmode voltages in conjunction with matching errors in the \nfeedback network.  \nThe first output error component is calculated as  \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=\nGG F\nIORR RV Vo_e 1 , or equivalently as V IO/β (21) \nwhere VIO is the input offset voltage.  \nThe second erro r is calculated as \n()F IO\nG FFG\nGG F\nIO RIR RRR\nRR RI Vo_e =\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n+\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=2  (22) \nwhere IIO is defined as the offset between the two input bias \ncurrents.  \nThe third error voltage is calculated as  \nVo_e3 = Δenr × (VICM − VOCM) (23) \nwhere Δ enr is the fractional mismatch between the two feedback  \nresistors.  \nThe total differential offset error is the sum of these three error \nsources.  \nAdditional Impact of Mismatches in the Feedback Networks  \nThe internal common -mode feedback network still force s the \noutput voltages to remain balanced, even when the R F/RG feed-\nback networks are mismatched. The mismatch, however, cause s \na gain error proportional to the feedback network mismatch.  \nRatio -matching errors in the external resistors degrade the \nability to reject common -mode signals at the V AN and V IN input \nterminals, similar to  a four resistor , difference amplifier made \nfrom a conventional op amp. Ratio -matching errors also produce  a \ndifferential output component that is equal to the V OCM input \nvoltage times the difference between the feedback factors (βs). \nIn most applications using 1% resistors, this component amounts  \nto a differential dc offset at the output that is small enough to  \nbe ignored.  Driving a Capacitive Load  \nA purely capacitive load react s with the bondwire and pin \ninductance of the AD8137, resulting in high frequency ringing \nin the transient response and loss of phase margin. One way to \nminimize this effect is to place a small resistor in series with each output to buffer the load capacitance. The re sistor and load \ncapacitance form s a first -order, low -pass filter ; therefore,  the \nresistor value should be as small as possible. In some cases, the ADCs require small series resistors to be added on their inputs.  \nFigure 37 and Figure 40 illustrate transient response vs. capacitive \nload and were generated using series resistors in each output \nand a differential capacitive load.  \nLayout Considerations  \nStandard high speed PCB layout practices should be ad hered  \nto when designing with the AD8137. A solid ground plane is \nrecommended and good wideband power supply decoupling networks should be placed as close as possible to the supply pins.  \nTo minimize stray capac itance at the summing nodes, the  \ncopper in all layers under all traces and pads that connect to  \nthe summing nodes should be removed. Small amounts of stray \nsumming -node capacitance cause peaking in the frequency \nresponse, and large amounts can cause inst ability. If some stray \nsumming -node capacitance is unavoidable, its effects can be \ncompensated for by placing small capacitors across the feedback \nresistors.  \nTerminating a Single -Ended Input  \nControlled impedance interconnections are used in most high \nspeed  signal applications, and they require at least one line \ntermination. In analog applications, a matched resistive termination  \nis generally placed at the load end of the line. This section deals \nwith how to properly terminate a single -ended input to the AD8137.  \nThe input resistance presented by the AD8137 input circuitry  \nis seen in parallel with the termination resistor, and its loading \neffect must be taken into accou nt. The Thevenin equivalent \ncircuit of the driver, its source resistance, and the termination \nresistance must all be included in the calculation as well. An \nexact solution to the problem requires solution of several simultaneous algebraic equations and is beyond the scope of \nthis data sheet. An iterative solution is also possible and is easier , \nespecially considering the fact that standard resistor values are generally used.  \n \nData Sheet AD8137 \n \nRev. E | Page 27 of 32 Figure 67 shows the AD8137 in a unity -gain configuration, and \nwith the following discussion, provides a good example of how \nto provide a proper termination in a 50 Ω environment.  \nAD8137+\n–8\n2\n1\n63\n40V2V p-p\nRT\n52.3Ω5\n+–\nVOCM1kΩ\n1.02kΩ\n1kΩ1kΩ0.1µF\n0.1µF+5V\n–5VVIN\nSIGNAL\nSOURCE50Ω\n04771-0-020 \nFigure 67. AD8137 with Terminated Input  \nThe 52.3 Ω  termination resistor, R T, in parallel with the 1 kΩ  \ninput resistance of the AD8137 circuit, yields an overall input \nresistance of 50 Ω  that is seen by the signal source. T o have \nmatched feedback loops, each loop must have the same R G if it \nhas the same R F. In the input (upper) loop, R G is equal to the 1  kΩ \nresistor in series with the (+) input plus the para llel combination   \nof R T and the source resistance of 50 Ω . In the upper loop, R G is \ntherefore equal to 1.03 k Ω. The closest standard  value is 1.02  kΩ \nand is used for R G in the lower loop.  \nThings become more complicated when it comes to determining  \nthe feedback resistor values. The amplitude of the signal source \ngenerator V IN is two times the amplitude of its output signal when  \nterminat ed in 50 Ω . Therefore, a 2 V p -p terminated amplitude \nis produced by a 4 V p- p amplitude from V S. The Thevenin \nequivalent circuit of the signal source and R T must be used when  \ncalculating the closed -loop gain because R G in the upper loop is \nsplit between t he 1 kΩ resistor and the Thevenin resistance \nlooking back toward the source. The Thevenin voltage of the \nsignal source is greater than the signal source output voltage \nwhen terminated in 50 Ω  because R T must always be greater \nthan 50 Ω . In this case, R T is 52.3 Ω and the Thevenin voltage \nand resistance are 2.04 V p- p and 25.6 Ω,  respectively.  \nNow the upper input branch can be viewed as a 2.04 V p -p \nsource in series with 1.03 kΩ. Because  this is to be a unity -gain \napplication, a 2 V p -p differential output i s required, and R F \nmust therefore be 1.03 kΩ × (2/2.04) = 1.01 kΩ ≈  1 kΩ. \nThis example shows that when R F and R G are large compared  to R T, \nthe gain reduction p roduced by the increase in R G is essentially \ncancelled by the increase in the Thevenin voltage ca used by R T \nbeing greater than the output resistance of the signal  source. In \ngeneral, as R F and R G become smaller in terminated applications, \nRF needs to be increased to compensate for  the increase in R G. \nWhen generating the typical performance characteris tics data, \nthe measurements were calibrated to take the effects of the  \nterminations on closed -loop gain into account.  Power -Down  \nThe AD8137 features a PD pin that can be used to minimize  the \nquiescent current consumed when the device is not being used. \nPD is asserted by applying a low logic level to Pin 7. The threshold  \nbetween high and low logic levels is nominally 1.1 V above the \nnegative supply rail. See Table 1 to Table 3 for the threshold limits.   \nThe AD8137 PD pin features an internal pull -up network that \nenables the amplifier  for nor mal operation . The AD8137 PD \npin can be left floating ( that is, no external connection  is \nrequired ) and does not require an external pull -up resistor to \nensure normal on operation  (see Figure 68). \nDo not connect the PD pin directly to V S+ in ±5 V applications . \nThis can cause the amplifier to draw excessive supply current \n(see Figure 59) and may induce oscillations a nd/or stability \nissues.  \n50kΩ\n5kΩ\n150kΩREF A PD\n–VS+VS+VS\nQ1 Q2\n04771-072 \nFigure 68. PD Pin C ircuit  \nDRIVING AN ADC WITH GREATER THAN 12 -BIT \nPERFORMANCE  \nBecause the AD8137 is suitable for 12 -bit systems, it is d esirable \nto measure the performance of the amplifier in a system with greater than 12 -bit linearity. In particular, the effective number \nof bits ( ENOB ) is most interesting. The AD7687 , 16-bit, 250  KSPS  \nADC perf ormance makes it an ideal candidate for showcasing \nthe 12 -bit performance of the AD8137.  \nFor this application, the AD8137  is set in a gain of 2  and driven \nsingle -ended through a 20  kHz band- pass filter, while the output \nis taken differentially to the input of the AD7687 (see Figure 69). \nThis circuit has mismatched R\nG impedances and, therefore , has a \ndc offset at the differential output. It is included as a test circuit to \nillustrate the performance of the AD8137. Actual application \ncircuits should have matched feedback networks.  \nFor an AD7687 input range up to −1.82 dBFS, the AD8137 power \nsupply is a single 5 V applied to V S+ with V S− tied to ground. To \nincrease the AD7687  input range to −0.45 dBFS, the AD8137 \nsupplies are increased to +6 V and −1 V . In both cases, the V OCM \npin is biased with 2.5 V and the PD pin is left floating. All voltage \nsupplies are decoupled with 0.1 µF capacitors . Figure 70 and \nFigure 71 show the performance of the −1.82 dBFS setup and the \n−0.45 dBFS setup, respectively.  \n \nAD8137 Data Sheet \n \nRev.
