The silicone cement lacquer  \ncoating enables AC series to withstand challenging  \noperating and environmental conditions. The coating is  \nresistant to cleaning solvents specified in IEC 60115-1 (1). \nProduction is strictly controll ed and follows an extensive set  \nof instructions established for reproducibility.The winding is done with a specific material on a specially  \ndeveloped fine ceramic body (Al\n2O3). The ceramic meets the  \nhighest requirements against mechanical resistance,  \nthermal shocks, dielectric strength, and insulation  \nresistance at high temperature s. With different diameters  \nand turn spacings of resistive wire, a large ohmic value  \nrange can be covered.The resistors are marked with resistance, rated dissipation  \n(P\n40) and tolerance. Product qua lity is verified by testing  \nprocedures, performed on all individual resistors.  \nResistance is measured on the lead wires at a distance of  \n6 mm from the resistor body. If a greater length of lead wire  \nis used in the application, the user may need to consider the  \nadditional wire resistance, pa rticularly with low resistance  \nproducts.\nMATERIALS\nVishay acknowledges the following systems for the  \nregulation of hazardous substances:• IEC 62474, Material Declaration for Products of and for the  \nElectrotechnical Industry, with the list of declarable  \nsubstances given therein \n(2)\n• The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List  \n(GADSL) (3)\n• The REACH regulation (1907/2006/EC) and the related list  \nof substances with very high concern (SVHC) (4) for its  \nsupply chain\nThe products do not contain any of the banned substances  \nas per IEC 62474, GADSL,  or the SVHC list, see  \nwww.vishay.com/how/leadfree . Hence the products fully  \ncomply with the following directives:• 2000/53/EC End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (ELV) and  \nAnnex II (ELV II)\n• 2011/65/EU Restriction of the Use of Hazardous  \nSubstances Directive (RoHS) with amendment  \n2015/863/EU\n• 2012/19/EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment  \nDirective (WEEE)\nVishay pursues the eliminatio n of conflict minerals from  \nits supply chain, see the Conflict Minerals Policy at  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?49037ASSEMBLY\nThe resistors are axial leaded for soldering. The terminals of  \nthe resistors are completely lead (Pb)-free, the special tin  \nplating provides compatibility with lead (Pb)-free and  \nlead-containing soldering processes.Special lead forms may be av ailable on request, please  \ninquire at ww1resistors@vishay.com\n. As these components  \nare high power dissipation resi stors, customers are advised  \nto use a high melting point solder.\nAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nThe power dissipation of the resistor generates a  \ntemperature rise with respect to the ambient. The  \npermissible dissipation is de rated for tempe ratures above  \n40 °C, as shown in the derating  diagram, in order to avoid  \noverheating of the resistor. The heat dissipated from the  \nresistor may affect adjace nt components, hence proper  \nclearance will be required in order to avoid overheating. The  \nresistive wire is encapsulated by a protective lacquer  \ncoating. All materials used are non- flammable and inorganic. \nThese resistors do not feature a limited lifetime when  \noperated within the permissibl e limits. However, resistance  \nvalue drift increasing over operating time may result in  \nexceeding a limit acceptable to the specific application,  \nthereby establishing a functional lifetime.\nAPPROVALS\nAC-AT series is AEC-Q200 qualif ied, specifically for the use  \nin automotive applications. It is currently available only for  \nstandard axial ta ped parts and for AC03AT-WSZ,  \nAC05AT-WSZ.Contact us for the availabi lity of AC-AT in other lead  \ntermination bending forms.\nRELATED PRODUCTS\nUL approved, special cement coat ed fusible resistor is also  \navailable.
