The regulator\noperates at a fixed frequency that is programmed by one timing resistor, R T, and one timing capacitor, C T. RT\nestablishes a constant charging current for C T. This results in a linear voltage ramp at C T, which is fed to the\ncomparator, providing linear control of the output pulse duration (width) by the error amplifier.\nThe SGx524 contains an onboard 5-V regulator that serves as a reference, as well as supplying the SGx524\ninternal regulator control circuitry. The internal reference voltage is divided externally by a resistor ladder network\nto provide a reference within the common-mode range of the error amplifier as shown in Figure 10-5 , or an\nexternal reference can be used.\nThe output is sensed by a second resistor divider network and the error signal is amplified. This voltage is then\ncompared to the linear voltage ramp at C T. The resulting modulated pulse out of the high-gain comparator then\nis steered to the appropriate output pass transistor (Q1 or Q2) by the pulse-steering flip-flop, which is\nsynchronously toggled by the oscillator output. The oscillator output pulse also serves as a blanking pulse to\nensure both outputs are never on simultaneously during the transition times. The duration of the blanking pulse\nis controlled by the value of C T.\nThe outputs may be applied in a push-pull configuration in which their frequency is one-half that of the base\noscillator, or paralleled for single-ended applications in which the frequency is equal to that of the oscillator. The\noutput of the error amplifier shares a common input to the comparator with the current-limiting and shut-down\ncircuitry and can be overridden by signals from either of these inputs. This common point is pinned out externally\nvia the COMP pin, which can be employed to either control the gain of the error amplifier or to compensate it. In\naddition, the COMP pin can be used to provide additional control to the regulator.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\nA.

This pulse duration is controlled by\nthe value of C T as shown in Figure 7-2 . If small values of C T are required, the oscillator output pulse duration can\nbe maintained by applying a shunt capacitance from OSC OUT to ground.\n9.3.2 Error Amplifier\nThe error amplifier is a differential-input transconductance amplifier. The output is available for DC gain control\nor AC phase compensation. The compensation node (COMP) is a high-impedance node (R L = 5 M Ω). The gain\nof the amplifier is AV = (0.002 Ω–1)R L and easily can be reduced from a nominal 10,000 by an external shunt\nresistance from COMP to ground. Refer to Figure 7-1  for data.\n9.3.3 Compensation\nCOMP, as previously discussed, is made available for compensation. Since most output filters introduce one or\nmore additional poles at frequencies below 200 Hz, which is the pole of the uncompensated amplifier,\nintroduction of a zero to cancel one of the output filter poles is desirable. This can be accomplished best with a\nseries RC circuit from COMP to ground in the range of 50 k Ω and 0.001 μF. Other frequencies can be canceled\nby use of the formula f ≈ 1/RC.\n9.3.4 Output Circuitry\nSGx524 contains two identical npn transistors, the collectors and emitters of which are uncommitted. Each\ntransistor has antisaturation circuitry that limits the current through that transistor to a maximum of 100 mA for\nfast response.\n9.3.5 Current Limiting\nA current-limiting sense amplifier is provided in the SGx524 device. The current-limiting sense amplifier exhibits\na threshold of 200 mV ±25 mV and must be applied in the ground line since the voltage range of the inputs is\nlimited to 1 V to –1 V. Caution should be taken to ensure the –1-V limit is not exceeded by either input,\notherwise, damage to the device may result.\nFoldback current limiting can be provided with the network shown in Figure 9-1 . The current-limit schematic is\nshown in Figure 9-2 .\nO\nO(max)\nS\nOS\nSV R2 1I 200 mVR R1 R2\n200 mVIR/c230 /c246/c61 /c43 /c231 /c247/c43 /c232 /c248\n/c61\nFigure 9-1.

Current-Limit Schematic\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\n9.4.1 Synchronous Operation\nWhen an external clock is desired, a clock pulse of approximately 3 V can be applied directly to the oscillator\noutput terminal. The impedance to ground at this point is approximately 2 k Ω. In this configuration, R TCT must be\nselected for a clock period slightly greater than that of the external clock.\nIf two or more SGx524 regulators are operated synchronously, all oscillator output terminals must be tied\ntogether. The oscillator programmed for the minimum clock period is the master from which all the other\nSGx524s operate. In this application, the C TRT values of the slaved regulators must be set for a period\napproximately 10% longer than that of the master regulator. In addition, CT (master) = 2 C T (slave) to ensure\nthat the master output pulse, which occurs first, has a longer pulse duration and, subsequently, resets the slave\nregulators.\n9.4.2 Shutdown Circuitry\nCOMP also can be employed to introduce external control of the SGx524. Any circuit that can sink 200 μA can\npull the compensation terminal to ground and, thus, disable the SGx524.\nIn addition to constant-current limiting, CURR LIM+ and CURR LIM– also can be used in transformer-coupled\ncircuits to sense primary current and shorten an output pulse should transformer saturation occur. CURR LIM–\nalso can be grounded to convert CURR LIM+ into an additional shutdown terminal.www.ti.comSG2524, SG3524\nSLVS077F – APRIL 1977 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nApplication and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI\ndoes not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

For operation from a fixed 5-V supply, the\ninternal reference can be bypassed by applying the input voltage to both the V CC and V REF terminals.

This input supply\nshould be well regulated. If the input supply is located more than a few inches from the device, additional bulk\ncapacitance may be required in addition to the ceramic bypass capacitors. A tantalum capacitor with a value of\n47 μF is a typical choice, however this may vary depending upon the output power being delivered.SG2524, SG3524\nSLVS077F – APRIL 1977 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nAlways try to use a low EMI inductor with a ferrite type closed core. Some examples would be toroid and\nencased E core inductors. Open core can be used if they have low EMI characteristics and are located a bit\nmore away from the low power traces and components. Make the poles perpendicular to the PCB as well if using\nan open core. Stick cores usually emit the most unwanted noise.\n10.1.1 Feedback Traces\nTry to run the feedback trace as far from the inductor and noisy power traces as possible. You would also like the\nfeedback trace to be as direct as possible and somewhat thick. These two sometimes involve a trade-off, but\nkeeping it away from inductor EMI and other noise sources is the more critical of the two. Run the feedback trace\non the side of the PCB opposite of the inductor with a ground plane separating the two.\n10.1.2 Input/Output Capacitors\nWhen using a low value ceramic input filter capacitor, it should be located as close to the VIN pin of the IC as\npossible. This will eliminate as much trace inductance effects as possible and give the internal IC rail a cleaner\nvoltage supply. Some designs require the use of a feed-forward capacitor connected from the output to the\nfeedback pin as well, usually for stability reasons. In this case it should also be positioned as close to the IC as\npossible. Using surface mount capacitors also reduces lead length and lessens the chance of noise coupling into\nthe effective antenna created by through-hole components.\n10.1.3 Compensation Components\nExternal compensation components for stability should also be placed close to the IC. Surface mount\ncomponents are recommended here as well for the same reasons discussed for the filter capacitors. These\nshould not be located very close to the inductor either.\n10.1.4 Traces and Ground Planes\nMake all of the power (high-current) traces as short, direct, and thick as possible. It is good practice on a\nstandard PCB board to make the traces an absolute minimum of 15 mils (0.381 mm) per ampere. The inductor,\noutput capacitors, and output diode should be as close to each other possible. This helps reduce the EMI\nradiated by the power traces due to the high switching currents through them. This will also reduce lead\ninductance and resistance as well, which in turn reduces noise spikes, ringing, and resistive losses that produce\nvoltage errors.\nThe grounds of the IC, input capacitors, output capacitors, and output diode (if applicable) should be connected\nclose together directly to a ground plane. It would also be a good idea to have a ground plane on both sides of\nthe PCB. This will reduce noise as well by reducing ground loop errors as well as by absorbing more of the EMI\nradiated by the inductor. For multi-layer boards with more than two layers, a ground plane can be used to\nseparate the power plane (where the power traces and components are) and the signal plane (where the\nfeedback and compensation and components are) for improved performance. On multi-layer boards the use of\nvias will be required to connect traces and different planes. It is good practice to use one standard via per 200\nmA of current if the trace will need to conduct a significant amount of current from one plane to the other.\nArrange the components so that the switching current loops curl in the same direction. Due to the way switching\nregulators operate, there are two power states. One state when the switch is on and one when the switch is off.\nDuring each state there will be a current loop made by the power components that are currently conducting.\nPlace the power components so that during each of the two states the current loop is conducting in the same\ndirection. This prevents magnetic field reversal caused by the traces between the two half-cycles and reduces\nradiated EMI.www.ti.comSG2524, SG3524\nSLVS077F – APRIL 1977 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\n10.2 Layout Example\nGNDSG2524IN+\nCURR LIM+\nCURR LIM±\nRT\nCT\n9 COMP10 SHUTDOWNEMIT 1COL 1EMIT 2VCCREF OUT\nOSC OUTIN±\nGNDCOL 2VIA to Power PlanePower or GND Plane\nVIA to GND PlaneLEGEND\nVCC\n+\n+2\n3\n4\n7\n81\n65\n111213141516OUTPUT\nFigure 10-1.
