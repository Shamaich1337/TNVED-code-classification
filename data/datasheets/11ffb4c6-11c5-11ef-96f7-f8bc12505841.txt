Human Body Model (MIL -STD 883 Method 3015).  \n 2. Machine Model (JEDEC JESD22 -A115).  \nSwitching Frequency  \nThe PE42820 has a maximum 25 kHz switching \nrate in normal mode (pin 16 = GND). A faster \nswitching rate is available in bypass mode (pin 16 \n= V SS_EXT ). The rate at which the PE42820 can be \nswitched is then limited to the switching time as \nspecified in Table 1 . \n \nSwitching frequency describes the time duration  \nbetween switching events. Switching time is the  \ntime duration between the point the control signal  \nreaches 50% of the final value and the point the  \noutput signal reaches within 10% or 90% of its  \ntarget value.  \nSpurious Performance  \nThe typical low -frequency spurious performance \nof the PE42820 in normal mode is –137 dBm (pin \n16 = GND). If spur -free performance is desired, \nthe internal negative voltage generator can be \ndisabled by applying a negative voltage to Vss EXT \n(pin 16).  Optional External V SS Control (V SS_EXT ) \nFor applications that require a faster switching rate \nor spur -free performance, this part can be \noperated in bypass mode. Bypass mode requires \nan external negative voltage in addition to an \nexternal V DD supply voltage.    \n \nAs specified in Table 3 , the external negative \nvoltage (V SS_EXT ) when applied to pin 16 will \ndisable and bypass the internal negative voltage \ngenerator.  \nHot Switching Capability  \nThe typical hot switching capability of the \nPE42820 is +30 dBm. Hot switching occurs when \nRF power is applied while switching between RF \nports.  \nProduct Specification  \nPE42820  \nPage  5 of 12  Document No. DOC -94660 -1 │www.psemi.com  ©2019 pSemi Corp.

Evaluation Board Layout  Evaluation Kit  \nThe PE42820 evaluation kit board was designed \nto ease customer evaluation of the PE42820 RF \nswitch.  \n \nThe evaluation board in Figure 14 was designed \nto test the part.

A 50 Ω through transmission line is \navailable via SMA connectors J5 and J6. This \ntransmission line can be used to estimate the \nloss of the PCB over the environmental \nconditions being evaluated. An open -ended 50 Ω \ntransmission line is also provided at J4 for \ncalibration if needed.  \n \nNarrow trace widths are used near each part to \nimprove impedance matching.
