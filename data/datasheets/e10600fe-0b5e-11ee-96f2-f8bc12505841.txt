The device enters this mode whenever the V\nPPH voltage is applied to the Write \nProtect/Enhanced Program Supply Voltage pin (W /VPP).(2)\nThe memory is organized as 128 sectors, each containing 256 pages. Each page is 256 bytes wide. Thus, the whole memory can be viewed as consisting of 32768 pages, or 8388608 bytes.\nThe whole memory can be erased using the Bulk Erase instruction, or a sector at a time, \nusing the Sector Erase instruction.\nIn order to meet environmental requirements, Numonyx offers the M25P64 in Lead-free and \nRoHS compliant packages.\nNote: Important: This datasheet details the functionality of the M25P64 devices, based on the \nprevious process or based on the current T9HX process (available since March 2008). The new device in T9HX is backward compatible with the old one and it includes these additional features:\n- improved max frequency (Fast Read) to 75 MHz- UID/CFD protection feature\n1. 75 MHz operation is available only for process tech nology T9HX devices, identified by process identification \ndigit "4" in the device marking.\n2. Avoid applying VPPH to the W/VPP pin during Bulk Eras e with process technology T9 HX devices, identified by \nprocess identification digit "4" in the device marking.\nM25P64 Description\n 7/54\nFigure 1.

Data is shifted out on the \nfalling edge of Serial Clock (C). \n2.2 Serial Data Input (D)\nThis input signal is used to transfer data serially into the device. It receives instructions, addresses, and the data to be programmed. Values are latched on the rising edge of Serial Clock (C).\n2.3 Serial Clock (C)\nThis input signal provides the timing of the serial interface. Instructions, addresses, or data \npresent at Serial Data Input (D) are latched on the rising edge of Serial Clock (C). Data on \nSerial Data Output (Q) changes after the falling edge of Serial Clock (C). \n2.4 Chip Select (S )\nWhen this input signal is High, the device is deselected and Serial Data Output (Q) is at high impedance. Unless an internal Program, Erase or Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the device will be in the Standby Power mode. Driving Chip Select (S\n) Low selects the \ndevice, placing it in the Active Power mode.\nAfter Power-up, a falling edge on Chip Select (S ) is required prior to the start of any \ninstruction. \n2.5 Hold (HOLD )\nThe Hold (HOLD ) signal is used to pause any serial communications with the device without \ndeselecting the device.\nDuring the Hold condition, the Serial Data Output (Q) is high impedance, and Serial Data \nInput (D) and Serial Clock (C) are Don’t Care.\nTo start the Hold condition, the device must be selected, with Chip Select (S ) driven Low.\nSignal description M25P64\n10/54   \n2.6 Write Protect/Enhanced Program supply voltage (W /VPP)\nW/VPP is both a control input and a power supply pin. The two functions are selected by the \nvoltage range applied to the pin.\nIf the W /VPP input is kept in a low voltage range (0V to VCC) the pin is seen as a control \ninput. This input signal is used to freeze the size of the area of memory that is protected against program or erase instructions (as specified by the values in the BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits of the Status Register).\nIf V\nPP is in the range of VPPH it acts as an additional power supply pin. In this case VPP must \nbe stable until the Program/Erase algorithm is completed.(1)\n2.7 VCC supply voltage\nVCC is the supply voltage.\n2.8 VSS ground\nVSS is the reference for the VCC supply voltage.\n1. Avoid applying VPPH to the W/VPP pin during Bulk Eras e with process technology T9 HX devices, identified by \nprocess identification digit "4" in the device marking.\nM25P64 SPI modes\n 11/54\n3 SPI modes\nThese devices can be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI peripheral running in either of \nthe two following modes:\n\x84 CPOL=0, CPHA=0\n\x84 CPOL=1, CPHA=1\nFor these two modes, input data is latched in on the rising edge of Serial Clock (C), and \noutput data is available from the falling edge of Serial Clock (C).\nThe difference between the two modes, as shown in Figure 5 , is the clock polarity when the \nbus master is in Stand-by mode and not transferring data:\n\x84 C remains at 0 for (CPOL=0, CPHA=0)\n\x84 C remains at 1 for (CPOL=1, CPHA=1)\nFigure 4. Bus master and memory devices on the SPI bus\n1. The Write Protect (W /VPP) and Hold (HOLD ) signals should be driven, High or Low as appropriate.\nFigure 4  shows an example of three devices connected to an MCU, on an SPI bus. Only \none device is selected at a time, so only one device drives the Serial Data Output (Q) line at a time, the other devices are high impedance. Resistors R (represented in Figure 4 ) ensure \nthat the M25P64 is not selected if the Bus Master leaves the S\n line in the high impedance \nstate. As the Bus Master may enter a state where all inputs/outputs are in high impedance at \nthe same time (for example, when the Bus Master is reset), the clock line (C) must be \nconnected to an external pull-down resistor so that, when all inputs/outputs become high impedance, the S\n line is pulled High while the C line is pulled Low (thus ensuring that S  and \nC do not become High at the same time, and so, that the tSHCH  requirement is met). The \ntypical value of R is 100 k Ω, assuming that the time constant R*Cp (Cp = parasitic \ncapacitance of the bus line) is shorter than the time during which the Bus Master leaves the \nSPI bus in high impedance.AI13792SPI Bus Master\nSPI Memory\nDeviceSDO\nSDISCK\nCQD\nSSPI Memory\nDeviceCQD\nSSPI Memory\nDeviceCQD\nSCS3 CS2 CS1SPI Interface with\n(CPOL, CPHA) =\n(0, 0) or (1, 1)\nW/VPPHOLD HOLD HOLDRR RVCC\nVCC VCC VCCVSS\nVSSVSSVSSR\nW/VPP W/VPP\nSPI modes M25P64\n12/54   \nExample:  Cp = 50 pF, that is R*Cp = 5 μs <=> the application must ensure that the Bus \nMaster never leaves the SPI bus in the high impedance state for a time period shorter than \n5μs.\nFigure 5.

This is followed by the internal Program cycle (of duration t\nPP).\nTo spread this overhead, the Page Program (PP) instruction allows up to 256 bytes to be \nprogrammed at a time (changing bits from 1 to 0), provided that they lie in consecutive addresses on the same page of memory.\nFor optimized timings, it is recommended to use the Page Program (PP) instruction to \nprogram all consecutive targeted Bytes in a single sequence versus using several Page \nProgram (PP) sequences with each containing only a few Bytes (see Page Program (PP)  \nand Table 16: AC characteristics ).\n4.2 Sector Erase and Bulk Erase\nThe Page Program (PP) instruction allows bits to be reset from 1 to 0. Before this can be \napplied, the bytes of memory need to have been erased to all 1s (FFh). This can be achieved either a sector at a time, using the Sector Erase (SE) instruction, or throughout the entire memory, using the Bulk Erase (BE) instruction. This starts an internal Erase cycle (of duration t\nSE or tBE).\nThe Erase instruction must be preceded by a Write Enable (WREN) instruction.\n4.3 Polling during a Write, Program or Erase cycle\nA further improvement in the time to Write Status Register (WRSR), Program (PP) or Erase \n(SE or BE) can be achieved by not waiting for the worst case delay (tW, tPP, tSE, or tBE). The \nWrite In Progress (WIP) bit is provided in the Status Register so that the application program \ncan monitor its value, polling it to establish when the previous Write cycle, Program cycle or \nErase cycle is complete.\n4.4 Fast Program/Erase mode\nThe Fast Program/Erase mode is used to speed up programming/erasing. The device enters the Fast Program/Erase mode during the Page Program, Sector Erase, or Bulk Erase\n(1) instruction whenever a voltage equal to VPPH is applied to the W /VPP pin.\nThe use of the Fast Program/Erase mode requires specific operating conditions in addition \nto the normal ones (VCC must be within the normal operating range):\n\x84 the voltage applied to the W /VPP pin must be equal to VPPH (see Table 10 )\n\x84 ambient temperature, TA must be 25°C ±10°C,\n\x84 the cumulated time during which W /VPP is at VPPH should be less than 80 hours\n1. Avoid applying VPPH to the W/VPP pin during Bulk Eras e with process technology T9 HX devices, identified by \nprocess identification digit "4" in the device marking.\nOperating features M25P64\n14/54   \n4.5 Active Power and Standby Power modes\nWhen Chip Select (S ) is Low, the device is selected, and in the Active Power mode.\nWhen Chip Select (S ) is High, the device is deselected, but could remain in the Active \nPower mode until all internal cycles have completed (Program, Erase, Write Status Register). The device then goes in to the Standby Power mode. The device consumption drops to I\nCC1.\n4.6 Status Register\nThe Status Register contains a number of status and control bits that can be read or set (as appropriate) by specific instructions. For a detailed description of the Status Register bits, see Section 6.4: Read Status Register (RDSR) .\nM25P64 Operating features\n 15/54\n4.7 Protection modes\nThe environments where non-volatile memory devices are used can be very noisy. No SPI \ndevice can operate correctly in the presence of excessive noise. To help combat this, the M25P64 features the following data protection mechanisms:\n\x84 Power On Reset and an internal timer (t\nPUW) can provide protection against \ninadvertant changes while the power supply is outside the operating specification.\n\x84 Program, Erase and Write Status Register instructions are checked that they consist of \na number of clock pulses that is a multiple of eight, before they are accepted for \nexecution.\n\x84 All instructions that modify data must be preceded by a Write Enable (WREN) \ninstruction to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit. This bit is returned to its reset state by the following events:\n– Power-up– Write Disable (WRDI) instruction completion– Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction completion– Page Program (PP) instruction completion– Sector Erase (SE) instruction completion– Bulk Erase (BE) instruction completion\n\x84 The Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits allow part of the memory to be configured as \nread-only. This is the Software Protected Mode (SPM).\n\x84 The Write Protect (W\n/VPP) signal allows the Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits and \nStatus Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit to be protected. This is the Hardware Protected Mode (HPM).\n         Table 2.

However, taking this signal Low does not terminate any Write Status Register, Program or Erase cycle that is currently in progress.\nTo enter the Hold condition, the device must be selected, with Chip Select (S\n) Low.\nThe Hold condition starts on the falling edge of the Hold (HOLD ) signal, provided that this \ncoincides with Serial Clock (C) being Low (as shown in Figure 6 ).\nThe Hold condition ends on the rising edge of the Hold (HOLD ) signal, provided that this \ncoincides with Serial Clock (C) being Low.\nIf the falling edge does not coincide with Serial Clock (C) being Low, the Hold condition \nstarts after Serial Clock (C) next goes Low. Similarly, if the rising edge does not coincide with Serial Clock (C) being Low, the Hold condition ends after Serial Clock (C) next goes Low. (This is shown in Figure 6 ).\nDuring the Hold condition, the Serial Data Output (Q) is high impedance, and Serial Data \nInput (D) and Serial Clock (C) are Don’t Care.\nNormally, the device is kept selected, with Chip Select (S\n) driven Low, for the whole duration \nof the Hold condition. This is to ensure that the state of the internal logic remains unchanged from the moment of entering the Hold condition.\nIf Chip Select (S\n) goes High while the device is in the Hold condition, this has the effect of \nresetting the internal logic of the device. To restart communication with the device, it is necessary to drive Hold (HOLD\n) High, and then to drive Chip Select (S ) Low. This prevents \nthe device from going back to the Hold condition.\nFigure 6.

Memory organization (continued)\nSector Address range\nInstructions M25P64\n22/54   \n6 Instructions\nAll instructions, addresses and data are shifted in and out of the device, most significant bit \nfirst.\nSerial Data Input (D) is sampled on the first rising edge of Serial Clock (C) after Chip Select \n(S) is driven Low. Then, the one-byte instruction code must be shifted in to the device, most \nsignificant bit first, on Serial Data Input (D), each bit being latched on the rising edges of Serial Clock (C).\nThe instruction set is listed in Table 4 .\nEvery instruction sequence starts with a one-byte instruction code. Depending on the \ninstruction, this might be followed by address bytes, or by data bytes, or by both or none.\nIn the case of a Read Data Bytes (READ), Read Data Bytes at Higher Speed (Fast_Read), \nRead Status Register (RDSR), Read Identification (RDID) or Read Electronic Signature (RES) instruction, the shifted-in instruction sequence is followed by a data-out sequence. Chip Select (S\n) can be driven High after any bit of the data-out sequence is being shifted \nout.\nIn the case of a Page Program (PP), Sector Erase (SE), Bulk Erase (BE), Write Status \nRegister (WRSR), Write Enable (WREN) or Write Disable (WRDI), Chip Select (S ) must be \ndriven High exactly at a byte boundary, otherwise the instruction is rejected, and is not executed. That is, Chip Select (S\n) must driven High when the number of clock pulses after \nChip Select (S ) being driven Low is an exact multiple of eight. \nAll attempts to access the memory array during a Write Status Register cycle, Program \ncycle or Erase cycle are ignored, and the internal Write Status Register cycle, Program \ncycle or Erase cycle continues unaffected.\n         Table 4.

The UID contains the length of the following data in the first byte (set to 10h) and 16 bytes of the optional customized factory data (CFD) content. The CFD bytes are read-only and can be programmed with customers data upon their demand. If the customers do not make requests, the devices are shipped with all the CFD bytes programmed to zero (00h).\nAny read identification (RDID) instruction while an erase or program cycle is in progress, is \nnot decoded, and has no effect on the cycle that is in progress.\nThe read identification (RDID) instruction should not be issued while the device is in deep \npower-down mode.\nThe device is first selected by driving Chip Select (S\n) Low. Then, the 8-bit instruction code \nfor the instruction is shifted in. After this, the 24-bit device identification, stored in the memory, the 8-bit CFD length followed by 16 bytes of CFD content will be shifted out on \nserial data output (DQ1). Each bit is shifted out during the falling edge of Serial Clock (C). \nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 10 .\nThe read identification (RDID) instruction is terminated by driving Chip Select (S\n) High at \nany time during data output. When Chip Select (S ) is driven High, the device is put in the \nstandby power mode. Once in the standby power mode, the device waits to be selected so that it can receive, decode, and execute instructions.\n         \n         \n1.

Read Identification (RDID) instruction sequence and data-out sequence\n6.4 Read Status Register (RDSR)\nThe Read Status Register (RDSR) instruction allows the Status Register to be read. The \nStatus Register may be read at any time, even while a Program, Erase or Write Status \nRegister cycle is in progress. When one of these cycles is in progress, it is recommended to \ncheck the Write In Progress (WIP) bit before sending a new instruction to the device. It is also possible to read the Status Register continuously, as shown in Figure 11 .\n         \nThe status and control bits of the Status Register are as follows:\n6.4.1 WIP bit\nThe Write In Progress (WIP) bit indicates whether the memory is busy with a Write Status \nRegister, Program or Erase cycle. When set to 1, such a cycle is in progress, when reset to \n0 no such cycle is in progress. \n6.4.2 WEL bit\nThe Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit indicates the status of the internal Write Enable Latch. When set to 1 the internal Write Enable Latch is set, when set to 0 the internal Write Enable Latch is reset and no Write Status Register, Program or Erase instruction is accepted.\n6.4.3 BP2, BP1, BP0 bits\nThe Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits are non-volatile. They define the size of the area to be software protected against Program and Erase instructions.

When one or more of the Block Protect (BP2, \nBP1, BP0) bits is set to 1, the relevant memory area (as defined in Table 2 ) becomes \nprotected against Page Program (PP) and Sector Erase (SE) instructions. The Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits can be written provided that the Hardware Protected mode has not been set. The Bulk Erase (BE) instruction is executed if, and only if, all Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits are 0. \n6.4.4 SRWD bit\nThe Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit is operated in conjunction with the Write Protect (W\n/VPP) signal. The Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit and Write Protect \n(W/VPP) signal allow the device to be put in the Hardware Protected mode (when the Status \nRegister Write Disable (SRWD) bit is set to 1, and Write Protect (W /VPP) is driven Low). In \nthis mode, the non-volatile bits of the Status Register (SRWD, BP2, BP1, BP0) become read-only bits and the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction is no longer accepted for execution.\nFigure 11.

Before it can be accepted, a Write Enable (WREN) instruction must previously have been executed. After the Write Enable (WREN) instruction has been decoded and executed, the device sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL).\nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction is entered by driving Chip Select (S\n) Low, \nfollowed by the instruction code and the data byte on Serial Data Input (D).\nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 12 .\nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction has no effect on b6, b5, b1 and b0 of the \nStatus Register. b6 and b5 are always read as 0.\nChip Select (S ) must be driven High after the eighth bit of the data byte has been latched in. \nIf not, the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction is not executed. As soon as Chip Select (S\n) is driven High, the self-timed Write Status Register cycle (whose duration is tW) is \ninitiated. While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Status Register may still be read to check the value of the Write In Progress (WIP) bit. The Write In Progress (WIP) \nbit is 1 during the self-timed Write Status Register cycle, and is 0 when it is completed. \nWhen the cycle is completed, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is reset.\nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction allows the user to change the values of the \nBlock Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits, to define the size of the area that is to be treated as \nread-only, as defined in Table 2 . The Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction also allows \nthe user to set or reset the Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit in accordance with the Write Protect (W\n/VPP) signal. The Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit and Write \nProtect (W /VPP) signal allow the device to be put in the Hardware Protected Mode (HPM). \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction is not executed once the Hardware Protected \nMode (HPM) is entered.\n         \nThe protection features of the device are summarized in Table 7 .Table 7.

(Attempts to write to the Status Register are rejected, and are not \naccepted for execution). As a consequence, all the data bytes in the memory area that \nare software protected (SPM) by the Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits of the Status Register, are also hardware protected against data modification.\nRegardless of the order of the two events, the Hardware Protected Mode (HPM) can be \nentered:\n\x84 by setting the Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit after driving Write Protect \n(W\n/VPP) Low\n\x84 or by driving Write Protect (W /VPP) Low after setting the Status Register Write Disable \n(SRWD) bit.\nThe only way to exit the Hardware Protected Mode (HPM) once entered is to pull Write \nProtect/ (W /VPP) High.\nIf Write Protect/ (W /VPP) is permanently tied High, the Hardware Protected Mode (HPM) can \nnever be activated, and only the Software Protected Mode (SPM), using the Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits of the Status Register, can be used.\nFigure 12.

The instruction code for the Read \nData Bytes (READ) instruction is followed by a 3-byte address (A23-A0), each bit being latched-in during the rising edge of Serial Clock (C). Then the memory contents, at that address, is shifted out on Serial Data Output (Q), each bit being shifted out, at a maximum \nfrequency f\nR, during the falling edge of Serial Clock (C).\nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 13 .\nThe first byte addressed can be at any location. The address is automatically incremented \nto the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out. The whole memory can, therefore, be read with a single Read Data Bytes (READ) instruction. When the highest \naddress is reached, the address counter rolls over to 000000h, allowing the read sequence \nto be continued indefinitely.\nThe Read Data Bytes (READ) instruction is terminated by driving Chip Select (S\n) High. Chip \nSelect (S ) can be driven High at any time during data output. Any Read Data Bytes (READ) \ninstruction, while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in progress, is rejected without having any effects on the cycle that is in progress.\nFigure 13.

The instruction code for the Read \nData Bytes at Higher Speed (FAST_READ) instruction is followed by a 3-byte address (A23-A0) and a dummy byte, each bit being latched-in during the rising edge of Serial Clock (C). Then the memory contents, at that address, is shifted out on Serial Data Output (Q), each \nbit being shifted out, at a maximum frequency f\nC, during the falling edge of Serial Clock (C).\nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 14 .\nThe first byte addressed can be at any location. The address is automatically incremented \nto the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out. The whole memory can, therefore, be read with a single Read Data Bytes at Higher Speed (FAST_READ) \ninstruction. When the highest address is reached, the address counter rolls over to \n000000h, allowing the read sequence to be continued indefinitely.\nThe Read Data Bytes at Higher Speed (FAST_READ) instruction is terminated by driving \nChip Select (S\n) High. Chip Select (S ) can be driven High at any time during data output. Any \nRead Data Bytes at Higher Speed (FAST_READ) instruction, while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in progress, is rejected without having any effects on the cycle that is in progress.\nFigure 14.

Before it can be accepted, a Write Enable (WREN) instruction must previously have been executed. After the Write Enable (WREN) instruction has been decoded, the device sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL).\nThe Page Program (PP) instruction is entered by driving Chip Select (S\n) Low, followed by \nthe instruction code, three address bytes and at least one data byte on Serial Data Input (D). If the 8 least significant address bits (A7-A0) are not all zero, all transmitted data that goes \nbeyond the end of the current page are programmed from the start address of the same \npage (from the address whose 8 least significant bits (A7-A0) are all zero). Chip Select (S\n) \nmust be driven Low for the entire duration of the sequence.\nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 15 .\nIf more than 256 bytes are sent to the device, previously latched data are discarded and the \nlast 256 data bytes are guaranteed to be programmed correctly within the same page. If less \nthan 256 Data bytes are sent to device, they are correctly programmed at the requested addresses without having any effects on the other bytes of the same page. \nFor optimized timings, it is recommended to use the Page Program (PP) instruction to \nprogram all consecutive targeted Bytes in a single sequence versus using several Page Program (PP) sequences with each containing only a few Bytes (see Table 16: AC \ncharacteristics ).\nChip Select (S\n) must be driven High after the eighth bit of the last data byte has been \nlatched in, otherwise the Page Program (PP) instruction is not executed.\nAs soon as Chip Select (S ) is driven High, the self-timed Page Program cycle (whose \nduration is tPP) is initiated. While the Page Program cycle is in progress, the Status Register \nmay be read to check the value of the Write In Progress (WIP) bit. The Write In Progress (WIP) bit is 1 during the self-timed Page Program cycle, and is 0 when it is completed. At \nsome unspecified time before the cycle is completed, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is \nreset.\nA Page Program (PP) instruction applied to a page which is protected by the Block Protect \n(BP2, BP1, BP0) bits (see Table 2  and Table 3 ) is not executed.\nM25P64 Instructions\n 33/54\nFigure 15.

Before it \ncan be accepted, a Write Enable (WREN) instruction must previously have been executed. After the Write Enable (WREN) instruction has been decoded, the device sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL).\nThe Sector Erase (SE) instruction is entered by driving Chip Select (S\n) Low, followed by the \ninstruction code, and three address bytes on Serial Data Input (D). Any address inside the Sector (see Table 3 ) is a valid address for the Sector Erase (SE) instruction. Chip Select (S\n) \nmust be driven Low for the entire duration of the sequence. \nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 16 .\nChip Select (S ) must be driven High after the eighth bit of the last address byte has been \nlatched in, otherwise the Sector Erase (SE) instruction is not executed. As soon as Chip Select (S\n) is driven High, the self-timed Sector Erase cycle (whose duration is tSE) is \ninitiated. While the Sector Erase cycle is in progress, the Status Register may be read to \ncheck the value of the Write In Progress (WIP) bit. The Write In Progress (WIP) bit is 1 during the self-timed Sector Erase cycle, and is 0 when it is completed. At some unspecified time before the cycle is completed, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset.\nA Sector Erase (SE) instruction applied to a page which is protected by the Block Protect \n(BP2, BP1, BP0) bits (see Table 2  and Table 3 ) is not executed.\nFigure 16.

Before it can be accepted, a Write \nEnable (WREN) instruction must previously have been executed. After the Write Enable (WREN) instruction has been decoded, the device sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL).\nThe Bulk Erase (BE) instruction is entered by driving Chip Select (S\n) Low, followed by the \ninstruction code on Serial Data Input (D). Chip Select (S ) must be driven Low for the entire \nduration of the sequence. \nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 17 .\nChip Select (S ) must be driven High after the eighth bit of the instruction code has been \nlatched in, otherwise the Bulk Erase instruction is not executed. As soon as Chip Select (S ) \nis driven High, the self-timed Bulk Erase cycle (whose duration is tBE) is initiated. While the \nBulk Erase cycle is in progress, the Status Register may be read to check the value of the Write In Progress (WIP) bit. The Write In Progress (WIP) bit is 1 during the self-timed Bulk \nErase cycle, and is 0 when it is completed. At some unspecified time before the cycle is \ncompleted, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset.\nThe Bulk Erase (BE) instruction is executed only if all Block Protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits \nare 0. The Bulk Erase (BE) instruction is ignored if one, or more, sectors are protected.\nFigure 17.

The old-style Electronic Signature is supported for reasons of backward compatibility, only, and should not be used for new designs. New designs should, instead, make use of the JEDEC 16-bit Electronic Signature, and the Read Identifier (RDID) instruction.\nThe device is first selected by driving Chip Select (S\n) Low. The instruction code is followed \nby 3 dummy bytes, each bit being latched-in on Serial Data Input (D) during the rising edge \nof Serial Clock (C). Then, the old-style 8-bit Electronic Signature, stored in the memory, is \nshifted out on Serial Data Output (Q), each bit being shifted out during the falling edge of Serial Clock (C).\nThe instruction sequence is shown in Figure 18 .\nThe Read Electronic Signature (RES) instruction is terminated by driving Chip Select (S\n) \nHigh after the Electronic Signature has been read at least once. Sending additional clock \ncycles on Serial Clock (C), while Chip Select (S ) is driven Low, cause the Electronic \nSignature to be output repeatedly.\nWhen Chip Select (S ) is driven High, the device is put in the Standby Power mode. Once in \nthe Standby Power mode, the device waits to be selected, so that it can receive, decode and execute instructions.\nDriving Chip Select (S\n) High after the 8 -bit instruction byte has been received by the device, \nbut before the whole of the 8-bit Electronic Signature has been transmitted for the first time, still ensures that the device is put into Standby Power mode. Once in the Standby Power mode, the device waits to be selected, so that it can receive, decode and execute instructions.\nFigure 18.

The logic inside the device is held reset while VCC is less \nthan the Power On Reset (POR) threshold voltage, VWI – all operations are disabled, and \nthe device does not respond to any instruction.\nMoreover, the device ignores all Write Enable (WREN), Page Program (PP), Sector Erase \n(SE), Bulk Erase (BE) and Write Status Register (WRSR) instructions until a time delay of t\nPUW has elapsed after the moment that VCC rises above the VWI threshold. However, the \ncorrect operation of the device is not guaranteed if, by this time, VCC is still below VCC(min). \nNo Write Status Register, Program or Erase instructions should be sent until the later of:\n\x84 tPUW after VCC passed the VWI threshold\n\x84 tVSL after VCC passed the VCC(min) level\nThese values are specified in Table 8 .\nIf the delay, tVSL, has elapsed, after VCC has risen above VCC(min), the device can be \nselected for READ instructions even if the tPUW delay is not yet fully elapsed.\nAt Power-up, the device is in the following state: \n\x84 The device is in the Standby Power mode \n\x84 The Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset\n\x84 The Write In Progress (WIP) bit is reset\nNormal precautions must be taken for supply rail decoupling, to stabilize the VCC supply. \nEach device in a system should have the VCC rail decoupled by a suitable capacitor close to \nthe package pins. (Generally, this capacitor is of the order of 100 nF).\nAt Power-down, when VCC drops from the operating voltage, to below the Power On Reset \n(POR) threshold voltage, VWI, all operations are disabled and the device does not respond \nto any instruction. (The designer needs to be aware that if a Power-down occurs while a \nWrite, Program or Erase cycle is in progress, some data corruption can result.).\nPower up sequencing for Fast program/erase mode: VCC should attain VCCMIN  before VPPH \nis applied.\nPower-up and Power-down M25P64\n38/54   \nFigure 19.
