Each regulator delivers \nup to 150mA with a typical 300mV dropout voltage. Each \nregulator’s quiescent current is low (30µA operating and \n<3µA in shutdown) and well-controlled in dropout, making \nit an excellent choice for battery-powered circuits.\nAnother key feature of the LT3032 is low output noise. \nAdding an external 10nF bypass capacitor to each regulator  \nreduces output noise to 20µV RMS/30µV RMS over a 10Hz to \n100kHz bandwidth. The LT3032 is stable with minimum \noutput capacitors of 2.2µF. The regulators do not require \nthe addition of ESR as is common with other regulators. \nThe regulators are offered  as adjustable output devices  with \nan output voltage down to the ±1.22V reference voltage or \nin fixed voltages of ±3.3V, ±5V, ±12V and ±15V. Internal \nprotection circuitry includes reverse-output protection, \ncurrent limiting and thermal limiting.\nThe LT3032 is available in a unique low profile 14-lead \n4mm × 3mm × 0.75mm DFN package with exposed back -\nside \npads for each regulator, allowing optimum thermal \nperformance.\nDual Polarity Low Noise 150mA Power SupplyAPPLICATIONSn Low Noise: 20µV RMS (Positive) and  \n30µV RMS (Negative)\nn Low Quiescent Current: 30µA/Channel\nn Wide Input Voltage Range: ±2.3V to ±20V\nn Output Current: ±150mA\nn Low Shutdown Current: <3µA Total (Typical)\nn Low Dropout Voltage: 300mV/Channel\nn Fixed Output Voltages: ±3.3V, ±5V, ±12V, ±15V\nn Adjustable Outputs from ±1.22V to ±20V\nn No Protection Diodes Needed\nn Stable with 2.2µF Output Capacitors\nn Stable with  Ceramic, Tantalum or Aluminum Capacitors\nn Starts into Reverse Output Voltage\nn Current Limit and Thermal Limit\nn Low Profile 14-Lead 4mm × 3mm × 0.75mm  \nDFN Package\nn Battery-Powered Instruments\nn Bipolar Power Supplies\nn Low Noise Power Supplies\nL, LT , LT C , LT M , Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks and \nThinSOT is a trademark of Analog Devices, Inc.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: The LT3032 is tested and specified under pulse load conditions \nsuch that T\nJ ≅ TA. The LT3032E is 100% tested at T A = 25°C. Performance \nof the LT3032E over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range is assured by design, characterization, and correlation with statistical process controls. The LT3032I regulators are guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. \nNote 3: Parasitic diodes exist internally between the INN pin and the OUTN, \nADJN, and SHDNN pins. These pins cannot be pulled more than 0.5V \nbelow the INN pin during fault conditions, and must remain at a voltage more positive than the INN pin during operation.\nNote 4: Operating conditions are limited by maximum junction \ntemperature. Specifications do not apply for all possible combinations of input voltages and output currents. When operating at maximum input voltages, the output current ranges must be limited. When operating at \nmaximum  output currents, the input voltage ranges must be limited.\nNote 5:\n The LT3032 is tested and specified for these conditions with the \nADJP pin tied to the OUTP pin and the ADJN pin tied to the OUTN pin.\nNote 6: To  satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, the LT3032 is \ntested and specified for these conditions with an external resistor divider \n(two 250k resistors) from OUTP/OUTN to the corresponding ADJP/ADJN pin to give an output voltage of ±2.44V. The external resistor divider adds a 5µA DC load on the output. The LT3032-12/LT3032-15 have higher internal resistor divider current, resulting in higher GND pin current at \nlight/ no load.\nNote 7: Dropout voltage is the minimum input-to-output voltage differential needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, output voltage equals: \n VINP/INN  – V DROPOUTFor lower output voltages, dropout voltage is limited by the minimum input voltage specification under some output voltage/load conditions; see curves for Minimum INN Voltage and Minimum INP Voltage in Typical Performance Characteristics. LT C  is unable to guarantee Maximum \nDropout Voltage specifications at 50mA and 150mA due to production \ntest limitations with Kelvin-Sensing the package pins. Please consult the \nT\nypical Performance Characteristics for curves of Dropout Voltage as a \nfunction of Output Load Current and Temperature.\nNote 8: GND pin current is tested with V INP = V OUTP(NOMINAL)  or V INN = \nVOUTN(NOMINAL)  and a current source load. This means the device is tested \nwhile operating in its dropout region. This is the worst-case GND pin \ncurrent. GND pin current decreases slightly at higher input voltages.\nNote 9: Positive current flow is into the pin. Negative current flow is out of \nthe pin. \nNote 10: For input-to-output differential voltages from INN to OUTN \ngreater than –7V, a –50µA load is needed to maintain regulation.\nNote 11: Reverse output current is tested with the INP pin grounded and \nthe OUTP pin forced to the nominal output voltage. This current flows into the OUTP pin and out the GND pin.\nNote 12: Positive side current limit is tested at V\nINP = 2.3V or \nVOUTP(NOMINAL)  + 1V (whichever is more positive). Negative side current \nlimit is tested at V INN = –2.3V or V OUTN(NOMINAL)  – 1V (whichever is more \nnegative). Note 13: LT C  is unable to guarantee load regulation specifications on \nfixed voltage versions of the LT3032 due to production test limitations \nwith Kelvin-Sensing the package pins.

This output supplies power \nto the positive side load. A minimum output capacitor \nof 2.2µF is required to prevent oscillations. Larger out -\nput capacitors are required for applications with large \ntransient loads to limit peak voltage transients. See the \nApplications Information section for more information \non output capacitance, bypass capacitance, and reverse \noutput characteristics.\nADJP (Pin 2, Adjustable Part Only): Positive Adjust. This \nis the input to the positive side error amplifier. This pin \nis internally clamped to ±7V. It has a typical bias current \nof 30nA which flows into the pin (see curve of ADJP Pin \nBias Current vs Temperature in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics). The ADJP pin voltage is 1.22V referenced \nto ground and the output voltage range is 1.22V to 20V.\nBYPP (Pin 3): Positive Bypass. The BYPP pin is used to \nbypass the reference of the positive side regulator to achieve  \nlow noise performance. The BYPP pin is clamped internally  \nto ±0.6V  (one V BE). A small capacitor from OUTP to this pin \nwill bypass the reference to lower the output voltage noise. \nA maximum value of 0.01µF is used for reducing output  \nvoltage noise to a typical 20µV RMS over the 10Hz to 100 kHz \nbandwidth. If not used, this pin must be left unconnected.GND (Pins 4, 5, Exposed Pad Pin 15): Ground. One of \nthe DFN’s exposed backside pads (Pin 15) is an electrical \nconnection to ground. To ensure proper electrical and \nthermal performance, solder Pin 15 to the PCB’s ground \nand tie directly to Pins 4 and 5. Connect the bottom of \nthe positive and negative output voltage setting resistor \ndividers directly to Pins 4 and 5 for optimum load regula -\ntion performance.\nINN (\nPin 6, 9, Exposed Pad Pin 16): Negative Input. The \nDFN package’s second exposed backside pad (Pin 16) is \nan electrical connection to INN. To ensure proper electri -\ncal and  thermal performance, solder Pin 16 to the PCB’s \nnegative \ninput supply and tie directly to Pins 6 and 9.  \nPower is  supplied to the negative side of the LT3032 \nthrough \nthe INN pins. A bypass capacitor is required on \nthis pin if it is more than six inches away from the main \ninput filter capacitor. In general, the output impedance of \na battery rises with frequency, so it is advisable to include \na bypass capacitor in battery-powered circuits. A bypass \ncapacitor in the range of 1µF to 10µF is sufficient.TYPICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\nOUTP Transient Response  \nCBYPP = 0.01µF\nTIME (µs)0.04\n0.02\n0\n–0.02–0.04OUTP VOLTAGE\nDEVIATION (V)\n150100\n50\n0LOAD CURRENT\n(mA)\n3032 G490 40 80 120 160 200VOUTP  = 5V\nVINP = 6V\nCINP = 10µF\nCOUTP  = 10µFOUTN Transient Response  \nCBYPN = 0OUTN Transient Response  C\nBYPN = 0.01µF\nTIME (µs)0.2\n0.1\n0\n–0.2–0.1\n0\n–50\n–150–100OUTN VOLTAGE\nDEVIATION (V)LOAD CURRENT\n(mA)\n3032 G500 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1kVOUTN  = –5V\nVINN = –6V\nCINN = 10µF\nCOUTN  = 10µF\nTIME (µs)0.040.06\n0.02\n0\n–0.02\n–0.04–0.06\n–500\n–100–150OUTN VOLTAGE\nDEVIATION (V)LOAD CURRENT\n(mA)\n3032 G510 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500VOUTN  = –5V\nVINN = –6V\nCINN = 10µF\nCOUTN  = 10µF\nLT3032 Series15\n3032ff For more information www.linear .com/L T3032OUTN  (Pin 7):  Negative  Output.

Larger output \ncapacitors are required for applications with large tran -\nsient \nloads to limit peak voltage transients. A parasitic \ndiode exists between OUTN and INN; OUTN can not be \npulled more negative than INN during normal operation, \nor more than 0.5V below INN during a fault condition. See \nthe Applications Information section for more information \non output capacitance and bypass capacitors. \nADJN (Pin 8, Adjustable Part Only): Negative Adjust. This \nis the input to the negative side error amplifier. The ADJN \npin has a typical bias current of 30nA that flows out of the \npin. The ADJN pin voltage is –1.22V referenced to ground, \nand the output voltage range is –1.22V to –20V. A parasitic \ndiode exists between ADJN and INN. The ADJN pin cannot \nbe pulled more negative  than INN during normal operation, \nor more than 0.5V below INN during a fault condition.SHDNN (Pin 10): Negative Shutdown. The SHDNN pin puts \nthe negative side into a low power shutdown state. The \nSHDNN pin is referenced to ground for regulator control, \nallowing the negative side  to be driven by either positive \nor \nnegative logic. The negative output will be off if the \nSHDNN pin is within ±0.8V(typical) of ground. Pulling the \nSHDNN pin more than –1.9V or +1.4V(typical) will turn the \nnegative output on. The SHDNN pin can be driven by 5V \nlogic or open-collector logic with a pull-up resistor. The \npull-up resistor is required to supply the pull-up current of \nthe open- collector device, normally several microamperes, \nand the SHDNN pin current, typically 3µA out of the pin \n(for negative logic) or 6µA into the pin (for positive logic). \nIf unused, the SHDNN pin must be connected to INN. The \nnegative output will be shut down if the SHDNN pin is open \ncircuit. A parasitic diode exists between SHDNN and INN, \nthe SHDNN pin cannot be pulled more negative than INN \nduring normal operation, or more than 0.5V below INN \nduring a fault condition.PIN FUNCTIONS\nBYPN (Pin 11): Negative Bypass. The BYPN pin is used \nto bypass the reference of the negative side regulator to \nachieve low noise performance. A small capacitor from \nOUTN to this pin will bypass the reference to lower the \noutput voltage noise. A maximum  value of 0.01µF is used \nfor \nreducing output voltage noise to a typical 30µV RMS \nover the 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth. If not used, this pin \nmust be left unconnected.\nSHDNP (Pin 12): Positive Shutdown. The SHDNP pin puts \nthe positive side into a low power shutdown state. The \npositive output will be off when the SHDNP pin is pulled \nbelow 0.6V(typical). The SHDNP pin can be driven by 5V \nlogic or open-collector logic with a pull-up resistor. The \npull-up resistor is required to supply the pull-up current \nof the open-collector device, normally several microam -\nperes, and  the SHDNP  pin current, typically 1µA into the \npin. If unused, the SHDNP pin must be connected to INP. \nThe positive output will be shut down if the SHDNP pin \nis open circuit. The SHDNP pin can be tied directly to the \nSHDNN pin and both pins driven directly by positive logic \nfor a single point control of both outputs. \nNC (Pin 13/Pins 2, 8 for Fixed Voltage Devices): No \nConnect. The No Connect pin has no connection to inter -\nnal cir cuitry and may be tied to INP, GND, INN, SHDNP , \nSHDNN, OUTP, OUTN, floated, or tied to any other point.\nINP (\nPin 14): Positive Input. Power is supplied to the \npositive side of the LT3032 through the INP pin. A bypass \ncapacitor is required on this pin if it is more than six inches \naway from the main input filter capacitor. In general, the \noutput impedance of a battery rises with frequency, so \nit is advisable to include a bypass capacitor in battery-powered circuits. A bypass capacitor in the range of 1µF \nto 10µF is sufficient.\nLT3032 Series16\n3032ff For more information www.linear .com/L T3032The LT3032 is a dual 150mA positive and negative low noise  \nlow dropout linear regulator with micropower quiescent \ncurrent and shutdown. It supplies ±150mA at a dropout \nof 300mV. Output voltage noise can be lowered on the \npositive side to 20µV RMS and to 30µV RMS on the negative \nside over the 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth with the addition \nof 0.01µF reference bypass capacitors. Additionally, the \nreference bypass capacitors improve transient response, \nlowering the settling time for transient load conditions. \nQuiescent current is 25µA for the positive side and –30µA \nfor the negative side (45µA each for the LT3032-12/\nLT3032-15), typically dropping to less than 3µA total in shutdown. In addition to the low quiescent current, the \nLT3032 incorporates several protection features which \nmake it ideal for use in battery-powered systems. If the \nload is common mode between the two outputs, it does \nnot matter which output starts first; either output can be pulled to the opposing side of ground and the regulator will still start and operate.\nSetting Output Voltage\nThe adjustable LT3032 has output voltage ranges of 1.22V \nto 20V for the positive side and –1.22V to –20V for the \nnegative side. The output voltages are set by the ratio of \ntwo \nexternal resistor dividers as shown in Figure 1. The \nLT3032 servos the outputs to maintain the voltages at the \nADJP and ADJN pins to 1.22V and –1.22V, respectively. \nThe current in the bottom resistor of each divider (R1P \nor R1N) is equal to 1.22V/R1 and the current in the top \nresistor (R2P or R2N) is equal to the current in the bottom \nresistor plus the respective ADJP/ADJN pin bias current. \nThe bias current for ADJP and ADJN is 30nA at 25°C, \nflowing into the pin for ADJP and flowing out of the pin \nfor ADJN. The output voltages can then be calculated us -\ning the  formulas shown in Figure 1. The value of R1P or \nR1N \nshould be less than 250k to minimize errors in the \nresultant output voltage caused by the ADJP/ADJN pin \nbias current. Note that in shutdown the respective output \nis turned off and the divider current will be zero. Curves \nof ADJP Pin Voltage, ADJN Pin Voltage, ADJP Pin Bias \nCurrent, and ADJN Pin Bias Current (all vs Temperature) \nappear in the Typical Performance Characteristics.The LT3032 is tested and specified with the ADJP/ADJN \npin \ntied to the respective OUTP/OUTN pin and a ±5µA DC \nload (unless otherwise specified) for an output voltage \nof ±1.22V. Specifications for output voltages greater than \nthis will be proportional to ±1.22V ; (VOUT/±1.22V). For \nexample, load regulation for an output current change of 1mA to 150mA is –2mV typical at V\nOUTN = –1.22V. At \nVOUTN = –12V, load regulation is:\n (–12\nV/–1.22V)•(–2mV) = –19.6mV\nBypass Capacitors and Low Noise Performance\nThe LT3032 provides reasonable noise performance  \nwithout reference bypass capacitors from OUTP/OUTN \nto the corresponding BYPP/BYPN pin. Using the LT3032 \nwith the addition of reference bypass capacitors lowers \noutput voltage noise. Good quality low leakage capacitors \nare recommended. These capacitors bypass the internal \nreferences for the positive and negative sides of the LT3032, \nproviding low frequency noise poles. The noise poles \nprovided by the bypass capacitors decrease the output \nvoltage noise to as low as 20µV RMS for the positive side \nand 30µV RMS for the negative side with the use of 0.01µF \nbypass capacitors. The BYPP pin and BYPN pin are high impedance nodes \nand leakage into or out of these pins affects the reference \nvoltage. The BYPP pin operates at approximately  74\n mV at Figure 1.

DC leakages on the order \nof\n 1µA into or out of these pins can throw off the internal \nreference by 20% or more.\nOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe LT3032 requires output capacitors for stability. It \nis designed to be stable with most low ESR capacitors \n(typically ceramic, tantalum or low ESR electrolytic). A \nminimum output capacitor of 2.2μF with an ESR of 3Ω \nor less is recommended to prevent oscillations on each output. The LT3032 is a micropower device and output \ntransient response is a function of output capacitance. \nLarger values of output capacitance decrease peak devia -\ntions and provide improved transient response for larger \nload \ncurrent changes. Additional capacitors, used to de-\ncouple individual  components powered by the LT3032, \nincrease the effective output capacitor value. When using \nbypass capacitors (for low noise operation), larger values \nof output capacitors are needed. For 100pF of bypass ca -\npacitance, 3.3µF of  output capacitance is recommended. \nWith a 330pF bypass capacitor or larger, a 4.7µF output \ncapacitor is recommended. The shaded region of Figure 2  \ndefines the range over which the LT3032 is stable. The \nminimum \nESR needed  is defined by the amount of bypass \ncapacitance \nused, while the maximum ESR is 3Ω. These \nrequirements are applicable to both the positive and nega -\ntive linear regulator.Give \nextra consideration to the use of ceramic capacitors. \nCeramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of di -\nelectrics, each with different behavior across temperature \nand applied voltage. The most common dielectrics used are specified with EIA temperature characteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics are \ngood for providing high capacitances in a small package, \nbut they tend to have strong voltage and temperature \ncoefficients as shown in Figures 3 and 4. When used with \na 5V regulator, a 16V 10μF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an \neffective value as low as 1μF to 2μF for the DC bias voltage \napplied  and over the operating temperature range. The X5R \nand X7R dielectrics result in more stable characteristics \nand are more suitable for use as the output capacitor. \nThe X7R type has better stability across temperature, \nwhile the X5R is less expensive and is available in higher \nvalues. Care still must be exercised when using X5R and \nX7R capacitors. \n The X5R and X7R codes only specify \noperating temperature range and maximum capacitance \nchange over temperature. Capacitance change due to DC \nbias with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than Y5V and \nZ5U capacitors, but can still be significant enough to drop capacitor values below appropriate levels. Capacitor DC \nbias characteristics tend to improve as component case \nsize increases, but expected capacitance at operating \nvoltage should be verified in situ for a given application.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress. In \na ceramic capacitor, the stress can be induced by vibra -\ntions in  the system or thermal transients. Tapping on the \nceramic\n bypass capacitor with a pencil generated the noise  \nshown in Figure 5. Similar vibration induced behavior can \nmasquerade as increased output voltage noise.\nOUTPUT CAPACITANCE (µF)1ESR (/uni03A9)4.0\n3.53.02.52.01.51.00.5\n0\n3 10\n1762 F022 4 5 67 8 9STABLE REGION\nCBYP = 330pF\nCBYP ≥ 3300pFCBYP = 100pFCBYP = 0\nFigure 2. Stability\nLT3032 Series18\n3032ff For more information www.linear .com/L T3032Stability and Input Capacitance\nLow ESR, ceramic input bypass capacitors are acceptable \nfor applications without long input leads. However, applica -\ntions connecting a power supply to an LT3032’s circuit’s \nINP/INN and GND pins with long input wires combined \nwith low ESR, ceramic  input  capacitors are prone  to voltage  \nspikes, reliability concerns and application-specific board \noscillations. The input wire inductance found in many \nbattery-powered applications, combined with the low ESR \nceramic input capacitor, forms a high-Q LC resonant tank \ncircuit. In some instances this resonant frequency beats \nagainst the output current dependent LDO bandwidth and \ninterferes with proper operation. Simple circuit modifica -\ntions/solutions are  then required. This behavior is not \nindicative of LT3032 instability, but is a common ceramic input bypass capacitor application issue.\nThe self-inductance, or isolated inductance, of a wire is \ndirectly proportional to its length. Wire diameter is not a \nmajor factor on its self-inductance. For example, the self-\ninductance of a 2-AWG  isolated wire (diameter = 0.26”) is \nabout half the self-inductance of a 30-AWG  wire (diameter \n= 0.01”). One foot of 30-AWG  wire has about 465nH of \nself-inductance.One of two ways reduces a wire’s self- inductance. One  \nmethod \ndivides the current flowing towards the LT3032 \nbetween two parallel conductors. In this case, the farther \napart the wires are from each other, the more the self-\ninductance is reduced; up to a 50% reduction when placed \na few inches apart. Splitting the wires basically connects \ntwo equal inductors in parallel, but placing them in close \nproximity gives the wires mutual inductance adding to \nthe self-inductance. The second and most effective way \nto reduce overall inductance is to place both forward and \nreturn current conductors (the input and GND wires) in \nvery close proximity. Two 30-AWG  wires separated by only \n0.02”, used as forward– and return– current conductors, \nreduce the overall self-inductance to approximately one-\nfifth that of a single isolated wire.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nDC BIAS VOL TAGE (V)CHANGE IN VALUE (%)\n3032 F0320\n0\n–20\n–40–60–80\n–100\n0 4 8 10 2 6 12 14X5R\nY5V\n16BOTH CAPACITORS ARE 16V,\n1210 CASE SIZE, 10µF  \nFigure 3.

If the added impedance between \nthe \npower supply and the input is unacceptable, adding \nESR to the input capacitor also provides the necessary \ndamping of the LC resonance. However, the required ESR \nis generally higher than the series impedance required.\nThermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device is limited by \nthe maximum rated junction temperature (125°C). The \npower dissipated by the device is made up of the follow -\ning components:1.\n Output \ncurrent of each side multiplied by the respective  \n input/output voltage differential: (I OUT)(VIN to V OUT),  \n and\n2. GND \npin current for each side multiplied by its input  \n voltage: (I GND)(VIN)\nThe GND pin current of each side is found by examining \nthe GND Pin Current curves in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics. Total power dissipation equals the sum \nfor both channels of the components listed above.The LT3032 has internal thermal limiting designed to pro -\ntect each side of the regulator during overload conditions. \nFor \ncontinuous normal conditions, the maximum junction \ntemperature rating of 125°C must not be exceeded. It is \nimportant to give careful consideration to all sources of \nthermal resistance from junction to ambient. Additional \nheat sources mounted nearby must also be considered.The LT3032 is a surface mount device and heat sinking is \naccomplished by using the heat spreading capabilities of \nthe PC board and its copper traces. Copper board stiffen -\ners and  plated through-holes can also be used to spread \nthe heat generated by power devices.Note \nthat the exposed pads (Pins 15 and 16) are elect -\nrically connected\n to ground ( GND) and the negative input  \n(INN) respectively.The following table lists thermal resistance as a function \nof copper area on a fixed board size. All measurements \nwere taken in still air on a 4-layer FR-4 board with 1oz \nsolid internal planes and 2oz external trace planes with a \ntotal finished board thickness of 1.6mm.\nTable 3.

In ad-\ndition \nto the normal protection features associated with \nmonolithic\n regulators, such as current limiting and thermal  \nlimiting, the LT3032 is protected against reverse input \nvoltages and reverse output voltages on both channels. \nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nprotect the device against current overload conditions at \nthe outputs of the part. For normal operation, the junction \ntemperature should not be allowed to exceed 125°C.\nThe positive input of the LT3032 withstands 20V reverse \nvoltage. The negative input also withstands reverse volt -\nage, but  the negative input may not be more than 0.5V \n(one \nVBE) higher than the OUTN and SHDNN pins. This \nprovides protection against batteries that are plugged in \nbackwards.\nThe outputs of the LT3032 can be pulled to opposing volt -\nages without  damaging  the part. The outputs may be pulled  \nto the opposing polarity with a load that is common mode \nbetween the two and one regulator starts before the other; \nin this condition, it does not matter which regulator started \nfirst. Both sides are capable of having the output pulled to \nthe opposing polarity and both will still start and operate.If an input is left open circuit or grounded, the corre-\nsponding \noutput can be pulled to its opposing polarity by \nas much as 20V. The output will act like an open circuit; \nno current will flow into or out of the pin. If the input is \npowered by a voltage source, the output will source the \nshort-circuit current and will protect itself by thermal \nlimiting. In this case, grounding the respective SHDNP/\nSHDNN pin will turn off that side of the LT3032 and stop \nthe output from sourcing current.\nThe ADJP pin can be pulled above or below ground by \n±7V without damage to the device. If the input is left open \ncircuit or grounded, the ADJP pin acts like an open circuit \nwhen pulled below ground and like a large resistor ( typically  \n100k) in series with a diode when pulled above ground.\nLT3032 Series21\n3032ff For more information www.linear .com/L T3032APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIn situations where the ADJP pin is connected to a resistor \ndivider that would pull the ADJP pin above its 7V clamp \nvoltage if the output is pulled high, the ADJP pin input \ncurrent must be limited to less than 5mA. For example, a \nresistor divider is used to provide a 1.5V output from the \n1.22V reference and the output is forced to 20V. The top \nresistor of the divider must be chosen to limit the current \ninto the ADJP pin to less than 5mA when the ADJP pin is \nat 7V. The 13V difference between OUTP and ADJP divided \nby the 5mA maximum current into the ADJP pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 2.6k.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required on the posi -\ntive output, several different input/output conditions can \noccur\n. The output voltage may be held up while the input \nis either pulled to ground, pulled to some intermediate \nvoltage or is left open circuit. Current flow back into OUTP \nfollows the curve shown in Figure 6.\nIf the INP pin is forced below the OUTP pin or the OUTP \npin is pulled above the INP pin, input current typically \ndrops to less than 2µA. This can happen if the device is \nconnected \nto a discharged (low voltage) battery and the \noutput is held up by a backup battery or a second regula -\ntor circuit. The state of the SHDNP  pin has no effect on \nthe reverse output current if OUTP is pulled above INP .Figure 6.

The safe \noperating area protection activates when the differential \nvoltage between INN and OUTN is greater than -7V. The \nSOA protection decreases current limit as a function of \nthe voltage differential between INN and OUTN and keeps \nthe power transistor inside a safe operating region for all \nvalues of forward input-to-output voltage. The protection \nis designed to provide some output current at all values \nof INN to OUTN differential voltage up to the Absolute \nMaximum Rating. A 50µA load is required to maintain \nregulation for INN to OUTN differential voltages greater \nthan –7V. When in shutdown, protection circuitry remains \nactive and will cause the output to rise slightly at zero load. \nA small pre-load is needed for zero output, if desired (see graph of Quiescent Current vs Input Voltage in Typical \nPerformance Characteristics).\nWhen power to the negative side is first turned on, as the \ninput voltage rises, OUTN follows INN, allowing the regula -\ntor to  start into very heavy loads. During start-up, as the \nINN \nvoltage is rising, the differential voltage between INN \nand OUTN is small, allowing  the negative side to supply \nlarge \noutput currents. With a high INN voltage, a problem \ncan occur wherein removal of an output short will not al -\nlow the output voltage to fully recover. Other regulators, \nsuch \nas the LT1175, LT1964, and LT3080 also exhibit this \nphenomenon, so it is not unique to the LT3032.The problem occurs with a heavy output load when the INN \nvoltage is high and the OUTN voltage is low. Common situ -\nations are  immediately after the removal of a short-circuit \nor \nwhen the SHDNN pin is pulled high after the INN pin \nhas already been turned on. The load line for such a load \nmay intersect the output current curve at two points. If \nthis happens, there are two stable operating points for the \nnegative side of the LT3032. With this double intersection, \nthe INN supply may need to be cycled down to zero and \nbrought up again to make OUTN recover.\nLT3032 Series22\n3032ff For more information www.linear .com/L T3032PACKAGE DESCRIPTION\nPlease refer to http://www .linear.com/product/LT3032#packaging/ for the most recent package drawings.\n3.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)4.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
