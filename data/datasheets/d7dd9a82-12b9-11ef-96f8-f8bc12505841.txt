It delivers \nup to 5A and 0.9V up to 90% V IN output voltage. Built-in \ncompensation across the output voltage range eliminates \nthe need for external components. The feedback (FB) \nregulation accuracy over -40°C to +125°C is ±1.4%.\nThe device features a peak-current-mode control \narchitecture. An internal transconductance error amplifier \nproduces an integrated error voltage at an internal node \nthat sets the duty cycle using a PWM comparator, a high-\nside current-sense amplifier, and a slope-compensation \ngenerator. At each rising edge of the clock, the high-\nside MOSFET turns on and remains on until either \nthe appropriate or maximum duty cycle is reached, or \nthe peak current limit is detected. During the high-side \nMOSFET’s on-time, the inductor current ramps up. During \nthe second-half of the switching cycle, the high-side \nMOSFET turns off and the low-side MOSFET turns on. \nThe inductor releases the stored energy as its current \nramps down and provides current to the output.\nThe device features a MODE/SYNC pin that can be used \nto operate the device in PWM, PFM, or DCM control \nschemes and to synchronize the switching freqeuncy to \nan external clock. The device also features adjustable-\ninput undervoltage lockout, adjustable soft-start, open-\ndrain RESET , auxiliary bootstrap LDO and DL to LX \nshort detection features.\nMode Selection (MODE)\nThe logic state of the MODE/SYNC pin is latched when \nVCC and EN/UVLO voltages exceed the respective UVLO \nrising thresholds and all internal voltages are ready to \nallow LX switching. If the MODE/SYNC pin is open at \npower-up, the device operates in PFM mode at light \nloads. If the MODE/SYNC pin is grounded at power-up, \nthe device operates in constant-frequency PWM mode \nat all loads. Finally, if the MODE/SYNC pin is connected \nto V CC at power-up, the device operates in constant-\nfrequency DCM mode at light loads. State changes on the \nMODE/SYNC pin are ignored during normal operation.\nPWM Mode Operation\nIn PWM mode, the inductor current is allowed to go nega -\ntive. PWM operation provides constant frequency opera -\ntion at all loads, and is useful in applications sensitive to \nswitching frequency. However, the PWM mode of opera -\ntion gives lower efficiency at light loads compared to PFM \nand DCM modes of operation.PFM Mode Operation\nPFM mode of operation disables negative inductor current \nand additionally skips pulses at light loads for high \nefficiency. In PFM mode, the inductor current is forced \nto a fixed peak of 2A every clock cycle until the output \nrises to 102.3% of the nominal voltage. Once the output \nreaches 102.3% of the nominal voltage, both the high-side \nand low-side FETs are turned off and the device enters \nhibernate operation until the load discharges the output to \n101.1% of the nominal voltage. Most of the internal blocks \nare turned off in hibernate operation to save quiescent \ncurrent. After the output falls below 101.1% of the nominal \nvoltage, the device comes out of hibernate operation, \nturns on all internal blocks, and again commences the \nprocess of delivering pulses of energy to the output until it \nreaches 102.3% of the nominal output voltage.\nThe advantage of the PFM mode is higher efficiency at \nlight loads because of lower quiescent current drawn from \nsupply. The disadvantage is that the output-voltage ripple \nis higher compared to PWM or DCM modes of operation \nand switching frequency is not constant at light loads.\nDCM Mode Operation\nDCM mode of operation features constant frequency \noperation down to lighter loads than PFM mode, by not \nskipping pulses but only disabling negative inductor \ncurrent at light loads. DCM operation offers efficiency \nperformance that lies between PWM and PFM modes.\nLinear Regulator (V CC and EXTVCC)\nThe MAX17506 has two internal LDO (Low Drop-Out) \nregulators which powers V CC. One LDO is powered \nfrom V IN (INLDO) and the other LDO is powered from \nEXTVCC (EXTVCC LDO). Only one of the two LDOs is \nin operation at a time, depending on the voltage levels \npresent at EXTVCC. If EXTVCC voltage is greater than \n4.7V (typ), V CC is powered from EXTVCC. If EXTVCC is \nlower than 4.7V (typ), V CC is powered from V IN. Powering \nVCC from EXTVCC increases efficiency at higher input \nvoltages. EXTVCC voltage should not exceed 24V\nTypical V CC output voltage is 5V. Bypass V CC to SGND \nwith a 2.2μF low ESR ceramic capacitor. V CC powers \nthe internal blocks and the low-side MOSFET driver and \nre-charges the external bootstrap capacitor. Both INLDO \nand EXTVCC LDO can source up to 45mA for bias \nrequirements. The MAX17506 employs an under-voltage \nlockout circuit that forces the converter off when V CC \nfalls below 3.8V (typ). The converter is enabled again \nwhen V CC > 4.2V. The 400mV UVLO hysteresis prevents \nchattering on power-up/power-down.\nMaxim Integrated  │ 13\nMAX17506 4.5V–60V, 5A, High-Efficiency, Synchronous  \nStep-Down DC-DC Converter  \nwith Internal Compensation\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nAdd a local bypassing capacitor of 0.1μF on the EXTVCC \npin to SGND. Also, add a 4.7Ω resistor from the buck \nconverter output node to the EXTVCC pin to limit V CC \nbypass capacitor discharge current and to protect the \nEXTVCC pin from reaching its absolute maximum rating \n(-0.3V) during output short-circuit conditions. In applica -\ntions where the buck converter output is connected to \nEXTVCC pin, if the output is shorted to ground then the \ntransfer from EXTVCCLDO to INLDO happens seamless -\nly without any impact on the normal functionality. Connect \nthe EXTVCC pin to SGND when the pin is not being used.\nSetting the Switching Frequency (RT)\nThe switching frequency of the MAX17506 can be \nprogrammed from 100kHz to 2.2MHz by using a resistor \nconnected from RT to SGND. The switching frequency \n(fSW) is related to the resistor connected at the RT pin \n(RRT) by the following equation:\n3\nRT\nSW19 10R 1.7f−×≅\nwhere R RT is in kΩ and f SW is in kHz. Leaving the RT pin \nopen causes the device to operate at the default switching \nfrequency of 450kHz. See Table 1  for RT resistor values \nfor a few common switching frequencies.\nOperating Input Voltage Range\nThe minimum and maximum operating input voltages for \na given output voltage should be calculated as follows:\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( )OUT OUT(MAX) DCR(MAX) DS ONL(MAX)\nIN(MIN)\nSW (MAX) OFF MIN(MAX)\nOUT(MAX) DS ONH(MAX) DS ONL(MAX)VI R R\nV\n1f t\nI (R R−\n−\n−−+× +\n=\n−×\n+× −\nOUTIN(MAX)\nSW(MAX) ON MIN(MAX)VVft−=×\nwhere: \nVOUT = Steady-state output voltage  \nIOUT(MAX)  = Maximum load current\nRDCR(MAX)  = Worst-case DC resistance of the inductor  \nfSW(MAX)  = Maximum switching frequency  \ntOFF-MIN(MAX)  = Worst-case minimum switch off-time (160ns)  \ntON-MIN(MAX)  = Worst-case minimum switch on-time (160ns)  \nRDS-ONH  = Worst-case on-state resistances and high-side \ninternal MOSFET  \nRDS-ONL  = Worst-case on-state resistances and low-side \nexternal MOSFETExternal Frequency Synchronization\nThe internal oscillator of the MAX17506 can be synchro -\nnized to an external clock signal on the MODE/SYNC pin. \nThe external synchronization clock frequency must be \nbetween 1.1 x f SW and 1.4 x f SW, where f SW is the fre -\nquency programmed by the RT resistor. When an external \nclock is applied to MODE/SYNC pin, the internal oscilla -\ntor frequency changes to external clock frequency (from \noriginal frequency based on RT setting) after detecting 16 \nexternal clock edges. The converter will operate in PWM \nmode during synchronization operation. When MODE/\nSYNC is unconnected for PFM mode, internal 300kΩ \npulldown resistor on this pin pulls the node below VIL of \nthe SYNC threshold and maintains the part in PFM mode. \nWhen the external clock is applied on-fly then the mode \nof operation will change to PWM from the initial state of \nPFM/DCM/PWM. When the external clock is removed \non-fly then the internal oscillator frequency changes to \nthe RT set frequency and the converter will still continue \nto operate in PWM mode. The minimum external clock \npulse-width high should be greater than 22ns. See the \nMODE/SYNC section in the Electrical Characteristics  \ntable for details.\nDL to LX Short Detection\nIn MAX17506, DL and LX pins are adjacent to each \nother. To prevent damage to the low side external FET \nin case DL pin is shorted to the LX pins, DL to LX \nshort detection feature has been implemented. If the \nMAX17506 detects that the DL pin is shorted to the LX  \npins before startup, the startup sequence will not be  \ninitiated and output voltage will not be soft-started.\nOvercurrent Protection/HICCUP Mode\nThe MAX17506 is provided with a robust over-current \nprotection scheme that protects the device under over-\nload and output short-circuit conditions. A cycle-by-cycle \npeak current limit turns off the high-side MOSFET when -\never the high-side switch current exceeds an internal \nlimit. A runaway current limit on the high-side switch  \ncurrent protects the device under high input voltage, short Table 1.

One \noccurrence of the runaway current limit triggers a hiccup \nmode. In addition, if due to a fault condition, output volt -\nage drops to 68% (typ) of its nominal value any time after \nsoft-start is complete, hiccup mode is triggered. \nThe MAX17506 has two modes of operation under over -\nload conditions – the hiccup mode and the latchoff mode. \nIn hiccup mode, the converter is protected by suspend -\ning switching for a hiccup timeout period of 32768 clock \ncycles. Once the hiccup timeout period expires, soft-start \nis attempted again. In latchoff mode, the converter does \nnot attempt to soft-start the output after a timeout period. \nThe power supply to the MAX17506 needs to be cycled \nto turn-on the part again in latchoff mode of operation. A \nresistor connected from DL to SGND sets the peak and \nrunaway current limits and the operating mode during \noverload condition.\nRESET  Output\nThe MAX17506 includes a RESET  comparator to monitor \nthe status of the output voltage. The open-drain RESET  \noutput requires an external pullup resistor. RESET  goes \nhigh (high-impedance) 1024 switching cycles after the \nregulator output increases above 95.6% of the designed \nnominal regulated voltage. RESET  goes low when the \nregulator output voltage drops to below 92.2% of the set \nnominal output voltage. RESET  also goes low during \nthermal shutdown.\nPrebiased Output\nWhen the MAX17506 starts into a prebiased output, both \nthe high-side and the low-side switches are turned off so \nthat the converter does not sink current from the output. \nHigh-side and low-side switches do not start switching \nuntil the PWM comparator commands the first PWM \npulse, at which point switching commences. The output \nvoltage is then smoothly ramped up to the target value in \nalignment with the internal reference.Thermal Shutdown Protection\nThermal shutdown protection limits total power dissipation \nin the MAX17506. When the junction temperature of \nthe device exceeds +165°C, an on-chip thermal sensor \nshuts down the device, allowing the device to cool. The \nMAX17506 turns ON with soft-start after the junction \ntemperature reduces by 10°C. Carefully evaluate the total \npower dissipation (see the Power Dissipation  section) \nto avoid unwanted triggering of the thermal shutdown in \nnormal operation.\nApplications Information\nInput Capacitor Selection\nThe input filter capacitor reduces peak currents drawn \nfrom the power source and reduces noise and voltage \nripple on the input caused by the circuit’s switching. \nThe input capacitor RMS current requirement (I RMS) is \ndefined by the following equation:\n×= ×OUT IN OUT\nRMS OUT(MAX)\nINV (V - V )IIV\nwhere, I OUT(MAX)  is the maximum load current. I RMS has \na maximum value when the input voltage equals twice \nthe output voltage (V IN = 2 x V OUT), so I RMS(MAX) = \nIOUT(MAX) /2.\nChoose an input capacitor that exhibits less than +10°C \ntemperature rise at the RMS input current for optimal \nlong-term reliability. Use low-ESR ceramic capacitors with \nhigh ripple current capability at the input. X7R capacitors \nare recommended in industrial applications for their \ntemperature stability. Calculate the input capacitance \nusing the following equation:\n××\n=η× ×∆OUT(MAX)\nIN\nSW INI D (1- D)\nCfV\nwhere D = V OUT/VIN is the duty ratio of the converter, \nfSW is the switching frequency, ΔV IN is the allowable input \nvoltage ripple, and E is the efficiency.\nIn applications where the source is located distant from \nthe MAX17506 input, an electrolytic capacitor should \nbe added in parallel to the ceramic capacitor to provide \nnecessary damping for potential oscillations caused by \nthe inductance of the longer input power path and input \nceramic capacitor.\nInductor Selection\nThree key inductor parameters must be specified for \noperation with the MAX17506: inductance value (L), \ninductor saturation current (I SAT), and DC resistance RESISTANCE \n(kΩ)PEAK \nCURRENT \nLIMIT (A)RUNAWAY \nCURRENT \nLIMIT\n (A)FAULT \nOPERATING \nMODE\nOpen 7.8 8.8 Hiccup\n174 7.8 8.8 Latchoff\n61.9 7.2 8.2 Hiccup\n26.1 7.2 8.2 Latchoff\nMaxim Integrated  │ 15\nMAX17506 4.5V–60V, 5A, High-Efficiency, Synchronous  \nStep-Down DC-DC Converter  \nwith Internal Compensation\nwww.maximintegrated.com\n(RDCR). The switching frequency and output voltage \ndetermine the inductor value as follows:\nOUT\nSWVL2.2f=×\nwhere V OUT and f SW are nominal values.\nSelect a low-loss inductor closest to the calculated \nvalue with acceptable dimensions and having the lowest \npossible DC resistance. The saturation current rating \n(ISAT) of the inductor must be high enough to ensure that \nsaturation can occur only above the peak current-limit \nvalue.\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nX7R ceramic output capacitors are preferred due to their \nstability over temperature in industrial applications. The \noutput capacitors are usually sized to support a step load \nof 50% of the maximum output current in the application, \nso the output voltage deviation is contained to 3% of the \noutput voltage change. The minimum required output \ncapacitance can be calculated as follows:\n×= ×∆STEP RESPONSEOUT\nOUTIt1C2V\n≅+RESPONSE\nC sw0.33 1t ()ff\nwhere I STEP  is the load current step, t RESPONSE  is the \nresponse time of the controller, DVOUT is the allowable \noutput voltage deviation, f C is the target closed-loop \ncrossover frequency, and f SW is the switching frequency. \nSelect f C to be 1/9th of f SW if the switching frequency is \nless than or equal to 450kHz. If the switching frequency is \nmore than 450kHz, select f C to be 50kHz.\nSoft-Start Capacitor Selection\nThe MAX17506 implements adjustable soft-start operation \nto reduce inrush current. A capacitor connected from \nthe SS pin to SGND programs the soft-start time. The \nselected output capacitance (C SEL) and the output \nvoltage (V OUT) determine the minimum required soft-start \ncapacitor as follows:\nCSS ≥ 28 x 10 -6 x CSEL x VOUT\nThe soft-start time (t SS) is related to the capacitor \nconnected at SS (C SS) by the following equation:\ntSS = C SS/(5.55 x 10 -6)\nFor example, to program a 4ms soft-start time, a 22nF \ncapacitor should be connected from the SS pin to SGND.Setting the Input Undervoltage Lockout Level\nThe MAX17506 offers an adjustable input undervoltage \nlockout level. Set the voltage at which MAX17506 turns \non, with a resistive voltage-divider connected from V IN \nto SGND (see Figure 1 ). Connect the center node of the \ndivider to EN/UVLO.\nChoose R1 to be 3.3M I and then calculate R2 as follows:\n×=\nINUR1 1.215R2(V -1.215)\nwhere V INU is the voltage at which the MAX17506 is \nrequired to turn on. Ensure that V INU is higher than 0.8 \nx VOUT.\nLoop Compensation\nThe MAX17506 is internally loop compensated. However, \nif the switching frequency is less than 450kHz, connect a \n0402 capacitor (C12) between the CF pin and the FB pin. \nUse Table 2  to select the value of C12.\nAdjusting Output Voltage\nSet the output voltage with a resistive voltage-divider \nconnected from the positive terminal of the output \ncapacitor (V OUT) to SGND (see Figure 2 ). Connect the \ncenter node of the divider to the FB pin. Use the following \nprocedure to choose the resistive voltage-divider values:\nCalculate resistor R3 from the output to FB as follows:\n3\nC OUT_SEL451 10R3fC×=×\nwhere R3 is in k I, crossover frequency f C is in kHz, and \nCOUT_SEL  is actual derated capacitance of the selected \noutput capicitor at DC-bias voltage in µF. Choose f C to \nbe 1/9th of the switching frequency, f SW, if the switching \nfrequency is less than or equal to 450kHz. If the switching \nfrequency is more than 450kHz, select f C to be 50kHz.\nCalculate resistor R4 from FB to SGND as follows:Figure 1.

The inductance of these \nconnections must be kept to an absolute minimum due to \nthe high di/dt of the currents. Since inductance of a current \ncarrying loop is proportional to the area enclosed by the \nloop, if the loop area is made very small, inductance is \nreduced. Additionally, small current loop areas reduce \nradiated EMI.\nA ceramic input filter capacitor should be placed close to the \nVIN pins of the IC. This eliminates as much trace inductance \neffects as possible and give the IC a cleaner voltage supply. \nA bypass capacitor for the V CC pin also should be placed \nclose to the pin to reduce effects of trace impedance.\nWhen routing the circuitry around the IC, the analog \nsmall-signal ground and the power ground for switching \ncurrents must be kept separate. They should be connected \ntogether at a point where switching activity is at a \nminimum, typically the return terminal of the V CC bypass \ncapacitor. This helps keep the analog ground quiet. \nThe ground plane should be kept continuous/unbroken \nas far as possible. No trace carrying high switching \ncurrent should be placed directly over any ground plane \ndiscontinuity.\nPCB layout also affects the thermal performance of the \ndesign. A number of thermal vias that connect to a large \nground plane should be provided under the exposed pad \nof the part, for efficient heat dissipation.\nFor a sample layout that ensures first pass success, \nrefer to the MAX17506 evaluation kit layout available at  \nwww.maximintegrated.com .Table 2.
