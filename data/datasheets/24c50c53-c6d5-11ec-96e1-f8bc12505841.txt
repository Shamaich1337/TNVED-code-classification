All models are tested \nand specified with external 220uF x 3 ceramic output capacitors, 22uF x 2 (for \nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA) ceramic and plenty electrolytic external input \ncapacitors. All capacitors are low ESR types. These capacitors are necessary to accommodate our test equipment and may not be required to achieve specified performance in your applications. However, Murata recommends installation of these capacitors.Several parameters can be changed by PMBus.(See PMBus interface later)\n(2)Note that Maximum Power Derating curves indicate an average current at \ntypical input voltage. At higher temperatures and/or no airflow, the converter \nwill tolerate brief full current outputs if the total RMS current over time does \nnot exceed the Derating curve.(3)Mean Time Between Failure is calculated using the Telcordia SR -332 \nmethod,  +40degC, half output load, natural air convection.\n(4)The On/Off Control Input should use either a switch or an open \ncollector/open drain transistor referenced to GND. A logic gate may also be used by applying appropriate external voltages which do not exceed +Vin(5)“Hiccup” overcurrent operation repeatedly attempts to restart the converter \nwith a brief, full -current output. If the overcurrent condition still exists, the \nrestart current will be removed and then tried again. This short current pulse \nprevents overheating and damaging the converter. Once the fault is removed, \nthe converter immediately recovers normal operation.(6)Output noise may be further reduced by adding an external filter. At zero output current, the output may contain low frequency components which exceed the ripple specification. The output may be operated indefinitely with no load.(7)All models are fully operational and meet published specifications, including “cold start” at -40degC.\n(8)Regulation specifications describe the deviation as the line input voltage or output load current is varied from a midpoint value to either extreme.\n(9)Thermal Protection/Shutdown temperature is measured with the sensor in \nthe converter.\n(10)Do not exceed maximum power specifications when adjusting the output trim.(11)The maximum output capacitive loads depend on the Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) of the external output capacitor and, to a lesser extent, the distance and series impedance to the load. Larger caps will reduce \noutput noise but may change the transient response. Newer ceramic caps \nwith very low ESR may require lower capacitor values to avoid instability. \nThoroughly test your capacitors in the application. (12)Do not allow the input voltage to degrade lower than the input under voltage shutdown voltage at all times. Otherwise, you risk having the \nconverter turn off. The under voltage shutdown is not latching and will \nattempt to recover when the input is brought back into normal operating \nrange.\n(13)The outputs are intended to sink appreciable reverse current.\n(14)When the temperature decreases below the turn- in threshold, the \nconverter will automatically restart.\n(15)The thermal resistances are only reference data, and they are measured  with our evaluation board as below.\n50.8mm x 60.0mm x 1.6mm (8 Layer, 2oz copper each)FR -4.\n(16)About di/ dtcondition, please refer to the table described later.\n(17)Ensured by design.

Fuses should also be used when there is the possibility of sustained input voltage reversal which is not current limited. For greatest safety, we recommend a fast blow fuse installed in the ungrounded input supply line. The installer must observe all relevant safety standards and regulations. For safety agency approvals, install the converter in compliance with the end- user safety \nstandard.Input Under -Voltage Shutdown and Start -Up Threshold\nUnder normal start -up conditions, converters will not begin to regulate \nproperly until the ramping- up input voltage exceeds and remains at the \nStart -Up Threshold Voltage (see Specifications). Once operating, \nconverters will not turn off until the input voltage drops below the Under -\nVoltage Shutdown Limit. Subsequent restart will not occur until the input voltage rises again above the Start -Up Threshold. This built -in \nhysteresis prevents any unstable on/off operation at a single input voltage.Users should be aware however of input sources near the Under -\nVoltage Shutdown whose voltage decays as input current is consumed (such as capacitor inputs), the converter shuts off and then restarts as the external capacitor recharges. Such situations could oscillate. To prevent this, make sure the operating input voltage is well above the UV Shutdown voltage at all times.\nStart- Up Time\nAssuming that the output current is set at the rated maximum, the Vin to Vout Start -Up Time (see Specifications) is the time interval between the \npoint when the ramping input voltage crosses the Start -Up Threshold \nand the fully loaded regulated output voltage enters and remains within its specified accuracy band. Actual measured times will vary with input source impedance, external input capacitance, input voltage slew rate and final value of the input voltage as it appears at the converter.This converter includes a soft start circuit to moderate the duty cycle of its PWM controller at power up, thereby limiting the input inrush current.The On/Off Remote Control interval from On command to Voutregulated assumes that the converter already has its input voltage stabilized above the Start -Up Threshold before the On command. The \ninterval is measured from the On command until the output enters and \nremains within its specified accuracy band. The specification assumes \nthat the output is fully loaded at maximum rated current. Similar conditions apply to the On to Vout regulated specification such as \nexternal load capacitance and soft start circuitry.Recommended Input Filtering\nThe user must assure that the input source has low AC impedance to \nprovide dynamic stability and that the input supply has little or no inductive content, including long distributed wiring to a remote power \nsupply. For best performance, we recommend installing a low -ESR \ncapacitor immediately adjacent to the converter’s input terminals. The capacitor should be a ceramic type such as the Murata GRM32 \nseries and a electrolytic type such as Panasonic OS -CON series. Initial \nsuggested capacitor values are 22uF x 2 ceramic type and 1000uF x 1 \nelectrolytic type , rated at twice the expected maximum input voltage. \nMake sure that the input terminals do not go below the under voltage \nshutdown voltage at all times. More input bulk capacitance may be added \nin parallel (either electrolytic or tantalum) if needed.\nRecommended Output FilteringThe converter will achieve its rated output ripple and noise with additional external capacitor. The user may install more external output capacitance \nreduce the ripple even further or for improved dynamic response. Again, \nuse low -ESR ceramic (Murata GRM32 series). Initial values of 220uF x 3 \nceramic type may be tried, either single or multiple capacitors in parallel. \nMount these close to the converter. Measure the output ripple under your load conditions. Use only as much capacitance as required to achieve your ripple and noise objectives. Excessive capacitance can make step load recovery sluggish or possibly introduce instability. Do not exceed the maximum rated output capacitance listed in the specifications.\nOutput NoiseThis converter is tested and specified for output noise using designated external output components, circuits and layout as shown in the figures below. In the figure below, the two copper strips simulate real -world \nprinted circuit impedances between the power supply and its load. In order to minimize circuit errors and standardize tests between units, scope measurements should be made using BNC connectors or the probe ground should not exceed one half inch and soldered directly to the test circuit.\nMinimum Output Loading RequirementsThis converter regulates within specification and are stable under no load to full load conditions. Operation under no load might however slightly increase output ripple and noise.Thermal Shutdown\nTo prevent many over temperature problems and damage, these converters \ninclude thermal shutdown circuitry. If environmental conditions cause the \ntemperature of the converter’s to rise above the Operating Temperature Range up to the shutdown temperature, an on- board electronic temperature \nsensor will shut down the unit. When the temperature decreases below the \nturn-on threshold, the converter will automatically restart.\nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA\nhttp://www.murata.com/products/power\nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA A01 Page 15of 30MonoBKTM,  16A DC -DC Converter Series\nCAUTION : If you operate too close to the thermal limits, the \nconverter may shut down suddenly without warning. Be sure to \nthoroughly you’re your application to avoid unplanned thermal shutdown.\nTemperature Derating CurvesThe graph in this data sheet illustrates typical operation under a variety of conditions. The derating curves show the maximum continuous ambient air temperature. Note that these are \nAVERAGE measurements. \nNote that the temperatures are of the ambient airflow, not the \nconverter itself which is obviously running at higher temperature than the outside air. Also note that very low flow rates (below about 25 LFM) are similar to “natural convection,” that is, not using \nfan-forced airflow. Murata makes Characterization measurements \nin a closed cycle wind tunnel with calibrated airflow. We use both thermocouples and an infrared camera system to observe thermal \nperformance.\nCAUTION : This graph is collected at slightly above Sea Level \naltitude. Be sure to reduce the derating for higher density altitude.\nOutput Current Limiting\nCurrent limiting inception is defined as the point at which full power falls below the rated tolerance. See the Performance/Functional Specifications. Note particularly that the output current may briefly rise above its rated value in normal operation as long as the average output power is not exceeded. This enhances reliability and continued operation of your application. If the output current is too high, the converter will enter the short circuit condition.Output Short Circuit ConditionWhen a converter is in current -limit mode, the output voltage will \ndrop as the output current demand increases. Following a time- out \nperiod, the converter will restart, causing the output voltage to begin ramping up to its appropriate value. If the short -circuit \ncondition persists, another shutdown cycle will initiate. This rapid on/off cycling is called “hiccup mode”. The hiccup cycling reduces the average output current, thereby preventing excessive internal temperatures and/or component damage. A short circuit can be tolerated indefinitely.The “hiccup” system differs from older latching short circuit systems because you do not have to power down the converter to make it restart. The system will automatically restore operation as soon as the short circuit condition is removed.Power Good (PWGOOD)Please refer to the Connection Diagram on page 1 for PWGOOD \nconnection.\nThe Product has a power good (PWGOOD) output. PWGOOD is \nthe open drain of a MOSFET. Connect PWGOOD to Vin or another external voltage source less than 3.6V through a pull -up \nresistor. After applying the input voltage, the module turns on so \nthat PWGOOD is pulled to GND before the soft start is ready. After \nthe TRIM voltage reaches the threshold set internally, PWGOOD \nis pulled high after a delay. When the converter encounters any fault (e.g.: UV, OV, OT, UVLO, etc.), PGOOD is latched low and cannot be pulled high again until a new soft \nstart is initialized. PMBus\nTMAlert (ALT#)\nALT# is active low. A pull -up resistor connected to 3.3V is required if the \nALT# function is needed.If any PMBus\nTMwarnings appears, this terminal turn to High.\nThe CLEAR_FAULTS command is used to reset all stored warning and fault flags. \nSee, Clear Faults command and any Warning commands, if need.\nUVP/OVP FunctionThis product monitors a resistor divided feedback voltage to detect over \nand under voltage. When the feedback voltage becomes lower than 70% of the target voltage, after 1ms, the product turns OFF. The converter \nrestarts after a hiccup delay (about 16ms ). This function is enabled \n1.5ms after the soft -start is completed. \nWhen the feedback voltage becomes higher than 120% of the target \nvoltage, the circuit operates sink -mode to decrease output voltage. If the \noutput voltage reaches UV threshold, the device restarts after a hiccup delay. If the OV condition remains, the converter will not start until the OV condition is removed. Remote On/Off ControlPlease refer to the Connection Diagram on page 1 for On/Off connection.This converter is enabled when the On/Off pin is pulled high to Vin with respect to GND. This device is disabled when the On/Off pin is grounded or brought to within a low voltage (see Specifications) with respect to \nGND.\nDynamic control of the On/Off function should be able to sink appropriate \nsignal current when brought low and withstand appropriate voltage when brought high. Be aware too that there is a finite time in milliseconds (see Specifications) between the time of On/Off Control activation and stable, regulated output. This time will vary slightly with output load type and current and input conditions.Output Capacitive LoadUsers should only consider adding capacitance to reduce switching noise and/or to handle spike current load steps. Install only enough capacitance to achieve noise objectives. Excess external capacitance \nmay cause regulation problems, degraded transient response and \npossible oscillation or instability.\nSoldering GuidelinesMurata recommends the specifications below when installing these converters. These specifications vary depending on the solder type.Exceeding these specifications may cause damage to the product. Your \nproduction environment may differ therefore please thoroughly review \nthese guidelines with your process engineers .\nThis product can be reflowed once.\nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA\nhttp://www.murata.com/products/power\nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA A01 Page 16of 30MonoBKTM,  16A DC -DC Converter Series\nRecommended Lead -free Solder Reflow ProfilePreheat Temperature Less than 1degC per second\nTime over Liquidus 45 to 75 seconds\nMaximum Peak Temperature 250degC\nCooling Rate Less than 3degC per second\nPreheat Temperature Less than 1degC per second\nTime over Liquidus 60 to 75 seconds\nMaximum Peak Temperature 235degC\nCooling Rate Less than 3degC per secondReflow Solder Operations for surface-mount products\nFor Sn/Ag/Cu based solders:\nFor Sn/Pb based solders:\nCAUTION: Do not reflow the converter as follows,\nbecause the converter may fall from the substrate \nduring reflowing.\nPb-free solder processes\nFor Pb-free solder processes, the product is qualified for MSL 3 \naccording to IPC/JEDEC standard J -STD-020D.\nDuring reflow PRODUCT must not exceed 250degC at any time.\nDry Pack Information\nProducts intended for Pb-free reflow soldering processes are \ndelivered in standard moisture barrier bags according to \nIPC/JEDEC standard J -STD-033.\n(Handling, packing, shipping and use of moisture/reflow \nsensitivity surface mount devices.)Using products in high temperature Pb-free soldering processes \nrequires dry pack storage and handling. In case the products \nhave been stored in an uncontrolled environment and no longer \ncan be considered dry, the modules must be baked according to \nJ-STD-033.\nOutput Voltage AdjustmentThis product provides output voltage monitoring through the register of READ_VOUT (8Bh). In order to have correct output voltage setting and monitoring, the external voltage divider ( RTrim ) \nand the registers of VOUT_COMMAND (21h), VOUT_MARGIN_HIGH (25h), VOUT_MARGIN_LOW (26h), VOUT_SCALE_LOOP (29h) should be set correspondingly. The following shows how to set the output voltage.1.Determin the Rtrim value using following formula.\nRtrim ( kohm ) =  6 /( Vout -0.6 ) \nThen, connect an external trim resistor ( Rtrim ) between the Trim pin and GND \npin. The Rtrim resistor must be a 1/10W precision metal film type, ±0.5% \naccuracy or better with low temperature coefficient, ±100 ppm/ degC .\n2.Set the VOUT_COMMAND(21h) and the VOUT_SCALE_LOOP(29h) as \nfollows.\nVOUT_COMMAND : Target Voltage in hexadecimal\n(Least Significant Bit is 0.002V)\nVOUT_SCALE_LOOP:  Set following value in hexadecimalVOUT_SCALE_VALUE= 0.6/Target Vout\n(Least Significant Bit is 0.001)\n3.Set VOUT_MARGIN_HIGH (25h), VOUT_MARGIN_LOW (26h)\nas follows .\nVOUT_MARGIN_HIGH (25h): Vout margin (high) voltage in \nhexadecimal.(Should be set in the range of 100~110% of target Vout)\nVOUT_MARGIN_LOW (26h): Vout margin (low) voltage in \nhexadecimal.(Should be set in the range of 90~100% of target Vout)\n(Least Significant Bit is 0.002V respectively)\nThe following table shows the RTrim and PMBus\nTMparameters at particular \nVout for example.\nOutput Voltage Estimated Rtrim (kohm) 21h 29h 25h 26h\n0.7V 30+300x015E\n(0.7V)0x0359\n(0.857)0x0181\n(0.77V)0x013B\n(0.63V)\n1.0V 150x01F4\n(1.0V)0x0258\n(0.600)0x0226\n(1.1V)0x01C2\n(0.9V)\n1.2V 100x0258\n(1.2V)0x01F4\n(0.500)0x0294\n(1.32V)0x021C\n(1.08V)\n1.5V 4.7+2.00x02EE\n(1.5V)0x0190\n(0.400)0x0339\n(1.65V)0x02A3\n(1.35V)\n1.8V 4.7+0.30x0384\n(1.8V)0x014D\n(0.333)0x03DE\n(1.98V)0x032A\n(1.62V)PMBusTM Command Parameters\nCAUTION\nIt’s not recommended to change PMBusTMparameters when the power \nstage is enabled. Proper operation of the converter is not guaranteed to do \nso. Do not exceed the specified limits of the output voltage or the converter’s maximum power rating when applying these resistors. \nOutput Voltage Remote SenseThis function is capable to compensate up the voltage drop between the output and input of load. The sense range depend on the maximum voltage \nallowing on the Vout Pin. The sense trace should be short as possible and \nshielded by GND line or else to reduce noise susceptibility . The sense line \nlength is recommended within 10cm for output voltage stability . If the remote \nsense is not needed, Sense Pin should be connected to Vout PIN.\nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA\nhttp://www.murata.com/products/power\nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA A01 Page 17of 30MonoBKTM,  16A DC -DC Converter Series\nPMBusTMSerial Interface Description \nThe Power Management Bus (PMBusTM) is an open- standard, power -\nmanagement protocol that defines a means of communication with \npower conversion and other devices. The PMBus\nTMis a two -wire, bidirectional, serial interface, consisting of \na data line (SDA) and a clock line (SCL). The lines are externally pulled \nto a bus voltage when they are idle. When connecting to the lines, a \nmaster device generates the SCL signal and device address and \narranges the communication sequence. This is based on the I2C \noperation principles. This product is a PMBusTMslave which supports \nboth the standard mode (100kHz) and fast modes (400kHz). The \nPMBusTMinterface adds flexibility to the power supply solution. \nMulti Address \nTo support multiple devices used on the same PMBusTM, use the \nADDR pin or PMBusTMcommand D3h to program the different address \nfor each device. To determine the PMBus\nTMaddress through PMBusTM, please refer to \ntable about PMBusTMcommand D3h that is described following \npage.To determine by external resistor, connect a resistor between ADDR pin and AGND to set the ADDR voltage. The internal ADC converts the pin voltage to set the PMBus\nTMaddress. Maximum 16 addresses can \nbe set by ADDR pin. Following table shows the PMBusTMaddress for \ndifferent resistor values from ADDR pin to AGND.\nCaution\nDefault setting, PMBusTMaddress is fixed “30h” internally not able to \nchange by external resistor. If need to change by external resistor, please set D3h parameter by PMBus\nTM. \nR ADDR- GND( kohm) ADDRESS\n4.99 30h\n15 31h\n24.9 32h\n34.8 33h\n45.3 34h\n54.9 35h\n64.9 36h\n75 37h\n84.5 38h\n95.3 39h\n105 3Ah\n115 3Bh\n124 3Ch\n133 3Dh\n147 3Eh\n154 3FhStart and Stop Conditions \nThe start and stop are signaled by the master device which signifies the \nbeginning and the end of the PMBusTMtransfer. \nThe start condition is defined as the SDA signal transitioning from high to \nlow while the SCL is high. The STOP condition is defined as the SDA signal transitioning from low to high while the SCL is high as shown in Figure A. The master then generates the SCL clocks, and transmits the device address and the read/write direction bit r/w on the SDA line. Data is \ntransferred in 8 bit bytes by SDA line. Each byte of data is to be followed by an acknowledge bit. \nPMBus\nTMUpdate Sequence \nThis product requires a start condition, a valid PMBusTMaddress, a \nregister address byte, and a data byte for a single data update.\nThe product acknowledges the receipt of each byte by pulling the SDA line low during the high period of a single clock pulse. A valid PMBus\nTM\naddress selects the product. The product performs an update on the falling edge of the LSB byte. \nProtocol Usage \nAll PMBus\nTMtransactions on device are done using defined bus protocols. \nThe following protocols are implemented:\n• Send byte with PEC \n• Receive byte with PEC • Write byte with PEC • Read byte with PEC • Write word with PEC • Read word with PEC • Block read with PEC \nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA\nhttp://www.murata.com/products/power\nMYMGM1R816ELA5RA A01 Page 18of 30MonoBKTM,  16A DC -DC Converter Series\nPMBusTMBus message format \nIn the tables in Figure B, unshaded cells indicate that the bus host is \nactively driving the bus; shaded cells indicate that the device is driving \nthe bus. S = start condition Sr= repeated start condition \nP = stop condition \nR = read bit \nW= write bit A = acknowledge bit (0) A#= acknowledge bit (1) \n“A” represents the ACK (acknowledge) bit. The ACK bit is typically \nactive low (Logic 0) if the transmitted byte is successfully received by a \ndevice. However, when the receiving device is the bus master, the \nacknowledge bit for the last byte read is a logic 1, indicated by A#. \nPacket Error Checking (PEC) \nThe device PMBus\nTMinterface supports the use of the packet error \nchecking (PEC) byte. The PEC byte is transmitted by the device during a read transaction or sent by the bus host to the device during a write transaction. The PEC byte is used by the bus host or the device to detect errors during a bus transaction, depending on whether the transaction is a read or a write. If the host determines that the PEC byte read during a \nread transaction is incorrect, it can decide to repeat the read if necessary. If the device determines that the PEC byte sent during a write transaction is incorrect, it ignores the command (does not execute it) and sets a status flag. Within a group command, the host can choose to send or not send a PEC byte as part of the message to the device. \nPMBus\nTMAlert Response Address (ARA) \nThe PMBusTMalert response address (ARA) is a special address that \ncan be used by the bus host to locate any devices that need to talk to it. \nA host typically uses a hardware interrupt pin to monitor the PMBusTM\nALERT pins of a number of devices. When a host interruption occurs, the host issues a message on the bus using the PMBus\nTM receive byte \nor receive byte with PEC protocol. The special address used by the host is 0x0C. Any devices that have a PMBus\nTMalert signal return their own 7- bit \naddress as the seven MSBs of the data byte. The LSB value is not used and can be either 1 or 0. The host reads the device address from the received data byte and \nproceeds to handle the alert condition. More than one devices may have \nan active PMBus\nTMalert signal and attempt to communicate with the \nhost. In this case, the device with the lowest address dominates the bus and succeeds in transmitting its address to the host. The device that \nsucceeds disables its PMBus\nTMalert signal. If the host sees that the \nPMBusTMalert signal is still low, it continues to read addresses until all \ndevices that need to talk to it have successfully transmitted their \naddresses. \nData and Numerical Formats \nThe device uses a direct format internally to represent real -world values \nsuch as voltage, current, power and temperature. All numbers with no suffix in this document are decimals unless explicitly designated otherwise. Numbers in binary format are indicated by the prefix “ n’b”, \nwhere n is the binary count. For example, 5’b01010 indicates a 5- bit \nbinary data, and the data is 01010. The suffix “h” indicates a hexadecimal format, which is generally used for the register address number in this document. The symbol “0x” indicates a hexadecimal format, which is used for the value in the register. For example, 0xA3 is a 1-byte number whose hexadecimal value is A3. \nPMBus\nTMCommunication Failure \nA data transmission fault occurs when the data is not properly transferred between the devices. There are several types of the data transmission faults as listed below: -Sending too few data \n-Reading too few data \n-Sending too many bytes \n-Reading too many bytes \n-Improperly set read bit in the address byte \n-Unsupported command code \nPMBus\nTMReporting and Status Monitoring \nThe device supports real -time monitoring for some operation parameters \nand status with PMBusTMinterface. They are listed on following table. \nSDA\na6-a0 b7-b0 b7-b0\nSCL\n  1-7 8 9   1-7 8 9   1-7 8 9\nS P\nST ART ADDRESS R/W ACK DAT A ACK DAT A ACK STOP\nCONDITION CONDITION\nFigure.

If a fault or warning condition still remains w henthe CLEAR_FAULTS \ncommand is issued, the ALT# signal may not be cleared or is reasserted almost immediately. Issuing a CLEAR_FAULTS command wil l not cause the \nconverter to restart in the event of a fault turn -off. The converter restart must be done by issuing an OPERATION command after the fault condition is cleared. \nThis command uses the PMBusTMto send the byte protocol. \nWRITE PROTECT (10h) \nThe WRITE_PROTECT command is used to control writes to the converter. This command provides protection against accidental changes. This command is \nnot intended to provide protection against deliberate or malicious changes to the converter’s configuration or operation. All the supported commands may have their parameters read, regardless of the WRITE_PROTECT settings. \nCAPABILITY (19h) \nThe CAPABILITY command returns information about the PMBus\nTMfunctions supported by this product. This command is read with the PMBusTMread byte \nprotocol. \nVOUT_MODE (20h) \nThe VOUT_MODE command is used to command and read the output voltage. The three most significant bits are used to determine t he data format (only \ndirect format is supported in this product), and the rest of five bits represent the exponent used in the output voltage Read/Wr ite commands. The default \nvalue of 20h is 0x40. \nVOUT_COMMAND (21h) \nThe VOUT_COMMAND sets the output voltage of this product. The VOUT_COMMAND and VOUT_SCALE_LOOP together determine the feedbac k \nreference voltage: VOUT_COMMAND x VOUT_SCALE_LOOP. In the section of “Output Voltage Setting” on page 28, it shows the detail s about how to set \nthe output voltage. \nThe value is unsigned and 1LSB = 2mV.

So the default value of 26h is 0x013B. \nVOUT_SCALE_LOOP (29h) \nVOUT_SCALE_LOOP sets the feedback resistor divider ratio and is equal to VFB/VOUT. Regardless of whether an external or inter nalfeedback resistor \ndivider is used, VOUT_SCALE_LOOP should match the actual feedback resistor divider used. \nThe value is unsigned and 1LSB =0.001. The default value is 0.857. So the default value of 29h is 0x0359. \nVIN_ON (35h) \nThe VIN_ON command sets the value of the input voltage, (in V), at which the converter should start to run if all other requi redpower -up conditions are \nmet. The VIN_ON value can be set between 7.5V and 15V with 0.25V increment. The VIN_ON value should be always set higher than VIN_OFF value \nwith enough margin, so that there will be no bouncing between VIN_ON and VIN_OFF during power conversion. \nThe value is unsigned and 1LSB=250mV. The default value is 7.25V. So the default value of 35h is 0x001D. \nVIN_OFF (36h) \nThe VIN_OFF command sets the value of the input voltage, (in V), at which the converter, once operation has started, should s toppower conversion. The \nVIN_OFF value can be set between 7.25V and 14.75V with 0.25V increment. The VIN_OFF value should be always set lower than VIN _ON value with \nenough margin, so that there is no bouncing between VIN_OFF and VIN_ON during power conversion. \nThe value is unsigned and 1 LSB=250mV. The default value is 6.75V. So the default value of 36h is 0x001B.

If the sensed current exceeds \nthis value, the OC warning flags are set in the STATUS BYTE (78h), STATUS_WORD (79h) respectively, and the ALT# signal is ass erted. \nThe value is unsigned and 1LSB=242mA. The default value is 0050h. The corresponding value of the total output current is about 19.4A . \nOT_WARN_LIMIT (51h) The OT_WARN_LIMIT is used to configure or read the threshold for the over -temperature warning detection. If the sensed temperature exceeds this value, \nan over temperature warning is triggered, the OT warning flags are set in the STATUS BYTE(78h) and STATUS_WORD(79h) respectiv ely, and the ALT# \nsignal is asserted. The minimum temperature warning detection time should be smaller than 20ms. \nThe value is unsigned and 1LSB=1 degC . The default value is 0x0091h. The corresponding value is 145degC. The OT_WARN_LIMIT setting value should \nbe lower than 155degC. \nVIN_OV_WARN_LIMIT (57h) \nThe VIN_OV_WARN_LIMIT command is used to configure or read the threshold for the input -over-voltage warning detection. If the measured value of VIN \nrises above the value in this register, VIN OV warning flags are set in the respective registers, and the ALT# signal is asserte d. \nThe value is unsigned and 1LSB=500mV. The default value is 0x20. The corresponding value is 16V. The VIN_OV_WARN_LIMIT setting value should not \nbe higher than 16V. \nVIN_UV_WARN_LIMIT (58h) \nThe VIN_UV_WARN_LIMIT command is used to configure or read the threshold for the input -under -voltage warning detection.
