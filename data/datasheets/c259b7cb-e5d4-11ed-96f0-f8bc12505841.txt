The \ndevices use current mode control architecture to deliver a very low \nduty cycle operation at high frequency with fast transient response and excellent loop stability.\nThe ISL8026, ISL8026A integrate a very low ON-resistance \nP-channel (36m Ω) high-side FET and N-channel (13m Ω) \nlow-side FET to maximize efficiency and minimize external \ncomponent count. The 100% duty-cycle operation allows less \nthan 180mV dropout voltage at 6A output current. The \noperation frequency of the Pulse-width Modulator (PWM) is \nadjustable from 500kHz to 4MHz. The default switching \nfrequency, which is set by conne cting the FS pin high, is 1MHz \nfor the ISL8026 and 2MHz for the ISL8026A.\nThe ISL8026, ISL8026A can be configured for discontinuous or \nforced continuous op eration at light load . Forced continuous \noperation reduces noise and RF interference, while \ndiscontinuous mode provides higher efficiency by reducing \nswitching losses at light loads.\nFault protection is provided by internal hiccup mode current \nlimiting during short-circuit an d overcurrent conditions. Other \nprotection, such as overvoltage and over-temperature, are also \nintegrated into the device. A power-good output voltage \nmonitor indicates when the output is in regulation. \nThe ISL8026, ISL8026A offer a 1ms Power-Good (PG) timer at \npower-up. When in shutdown , the ISL8026, ISL8026A \ndischarge the output capacitor through an internal soft-stop switch. Other features include internal fixed or adjustable \nsoft-start and internal/external compensation.\nThe ISL8026, ISL8026A are offered in a space saving 16 Ld \n3x3 Pb-free TQFN package with an exposed pad for improved \nthermal performance and 0.8mm maximum height. The \ncomplete converter occupies less than 142mm\n2.

Place a minimum of two 22µF cera mic capacitors from VIN to PGND as close as possible to the IC  \nfor decoupling.\n3 PG Power-good is an open-drain output. Use a 10k Ω to 100kΩ pull-up resistor connected between VIN and PG. At power-up or \nEN HI, PG rising edge is delayed by 1ms once the output voltage reaches regulation.\n4 SYNC Mode Selection pin. Connect to logic high or input voltage VIN for PWM mode. Connect to logic low or ground for PFM \nmode. Connect to an external function generator for synchroniz ation with the positive edge tr igger. There is an internal \n1MΩ pull-down resistor to prevent an undefined lo gic state in case the SYNC pin is floating. \n5 EN Regulator enable pin. Enable the output when driven high. Shut down the chip and discharge output capacitor when driven \nlow. \n6 FS This pin sets the oscillator switching frequency using a resistor, R FS, from the FS pin to GND. The frequency of operation \nmay be programmed between 500kHz to 4MHz. The default frequency is 1MHz (ISL8026), 2MHz (ISL8026A) if FS is \nconnected to VIN.\n7 SS SS is used to adjust the soft-start time. Connect to SGND fo r internal 1ms rise time. Connect a capacitor from SS to SGND t o \nadjust the soft-start time. Do not use more than 33nF per IC. \n8, 9 COMP, FB The feedback network of the regulator, FB, is the negative input to the transconductance error amplifier. The outpu t \nvoltage is set by an external resistor divider connected to FB . With a properly selected divider, the output voltage can be \nset to any voltage between the power rail (reduced by converter losses) and the 0.6V reference.COMP is the output of the amplifier if COMP is not tied to  VIN. Otherwise, COMP is disconnected through a MOSFET for \ninternal compensation. Must connect COMP to VIN in inte rnal compensation mode to meet a typical application. \nAdditional external networks across COMP and SGND might be required to improve the loop compensation of the amplifier operation.\nIn addition, the regulator power-good and undervoltage protecti on circuitry use FB to monitor the regulator output voltage.\n10 PGND/SGND Power/signal ground\n11, 12 PGND Power ground\n13, 14, 15 PHASE Switching node connections. Connect to one te rminal of the inductor. This pin is discharged by a 100 Ω resistor when the \ndevice is disabled.

The regulators operate \nat a 1MHz or 2MHz fixed defaul t switching frequency for high \nefficiency and allow smaller form factor when FS is connected to \nVIN. By connecting a resistor fr om FS to SGND, the operational \nfrequency adjustable range is 500k Hz to 4MHz. At light load, the \nregulator reduces the switching freq uency, unless forced to the fixed \nfrequency, to minimize the switching loss and to maximize the battery life. The quiescent current when the output is not loaded is \ntypically only 50µA. The supply curr ent is typically only 5µA when \nthe regulator is shut down. \nPWM Control Scheme\nPulling the SYNC pin HI (>0.8V) forces the converter into PWM mode, regardless of output current. The ISL8026, ISL8026A \nemploys the current-mode Pulse-width Modulation (PWM) control \nscheme for fast transient respon se and pulse-by-pulse current \nlimiting. Figure 3 on page 5\n shows the functional block diagram. \nThe current loop consists of th e oscillator, the PWM comparator, \ncurrent sensing circuit and the sl ope compensation for the current \nloop stability. The slope compensation is 440mV/Ts, which changes \nwith frequency. The gain for the current sensing circuit is typically \n140mV/A. The control reference for the current loops comes from the Error Amplifier\'s (EAMP) output. \nThe PWM operation is initialized by the clock from the oscillator. \nThe P-Channel MOSFET is turned on at the beginning of a PWM \ncycle and the current in the MOSFET  starts to ramp up. When the \nsum of the current amplifier, CS A, and the slope compensation \nreaches the control reference of the current loop, the PWM comparator COMP sends a signal to the PWM logic to turn off the \nP-FET and turn on the N-channel MOSFET. The N-FET stays on until \nthe end of the PWM cycle. Figure 53\n shows the typical operating \nwaveforms during the PWM operatio n. The dotted lines illustrate \nthe sum of the slope compensati on ramp and the Current-Sense \nAmplifier’s (CSA) output. \nThe output voltage is regulated by controlling the V EAMP  voltage \nto the current loop. The bandgap circuit outputs a 0.6V reference \nvoltage to the voltage loop. The feedback signal comes from the VFB pin. The soft-start block only affects the operation during the \nstart-up and will be discussed separately. The error amplifier is a \ntransconductance amplifier that co nverts the voltage error signal \nto a current output. The voltage loop is internally compensated with the 55pF and 100k Ω RC network. The maximum EAMP \nvoltage output is precisely clamped to 1.6V.\nSKIP Mode\nPulling the SYNC pin LOW (<0.4V) forces the converter into PFM mode. The ISL8026, ISL8026A ente rs a pulse-skipping mode at \nlight load to minimize the switching loss by reducing the \nswitching frequency. Figure 54\n illustrates the skip mode \noperation. A zero-cross sensing circuit shown in Figure 3 on \npage 5  monitors the N-FET current for zero crossing. When 16 \nconsecutive cycles are detected, the regulator enters the Skip mode. During the sixteen detecting cycles, the current in the \ninductor is allowed to become negative. The counter is reset to \nzero when the current in any cycle does not cross zero. \nOnce the skip mode is entered, the pulse modulation starts being \ncontrolled by the Skip comparator shown in Figure 3 on page 5\n. \nEach pulse cycle is still synchronized by the PWM clock. The P-FET is turned on at the clock\'s rising edge and turned off when \nthe output is higher than 1.2% of  the nominal regulation or when \nits current reaches the peak skip current limit value. Then, the \ninductor current is discharged to 0A and stays at zero (the \ninternal clock is disabled) and the output voltage reduces \ngradually due to the load current discharging the output capacitor. When the output voltage drops to the nominal voltage, \nthe P-FET will be turned on again at the rising edge of the internal \nclock as it repeats the previous operations. \nThe regulator resumes normal PWM mode operation when the \noutput voltage drops 2.5% below the nominal voltage.FIGURE 53.

Adjustable frequency ranges from \n500kHz to 4MHz via a simple resistor connecting FS to SGND, \naccording to Equation 2 : \nOvercurrent Protection\nThe overcurrent protection is realized by monitoring the CSA \noutput with the OCP comparator, as shown in Figure 3 on page 5 . \nThe current sensing circuit has a gain of 140mV/A, from the P-FET \ncurrent to the CSA output. When the CSA output reaches the \nthreshold, the OCP comparator is tripled to turn off the P-FET immediately. The overcurrent fu nction protects the switching \nconverter from a shorted output by monitoring the current flowing \nthrough the upper MOSFET. \nUpon detection of an overcurren t condition, the upper MOSFET \nwill be immediately turned off an d will not be turned on again \nuntil the next switching cycle. Upon detection of the initial \novercurrent condition, the overcurren t fault counter is set to 1. If, \non the subsequent cycle, another overcurrent condition is \ndetected, the OC fault counter will be incremented. If there are 17 sequential OC fault detections, the regulator will be shut down \nunder an overcurrent fault condition. An overcurrent fault \ncondition will result in the regulator attempting to restart in a hiccup mode within the delay of eight soft-start periods. At the \nend of the 8\nth soft-start wait period, the fault counters are reset \nand soft-start is attempted agai n. If the overcurrent condition \ngoes away during the delay of 8 soft-start periods, the output will \nresume back into regulation after hiccup mode expires.\nNegative Current Protection\nSimilar to overcurrent, the negative  current protection is realized \nby monitoring the current across the low-side N-FET, as shown in Figure 3 on page 5\n. When the valley point of the inductor current \nreaches -3A for 4 consecutive cy cles, both P-FET and N-FET are \nturned off. The 100 Ω in parallel to the N-FET will activate \ndischarging the output into regulation. The control will begin to \nswitch when output is within re gulation. The regulator will be in \nPFM for 20µs before switching to PWM, if necessary.\nPG \nPG is an open-drain output of a window comparator that continuously monitors the buck re gulator output voltage. PG is \nactively held low when EN is low and during the buck regulator \nsoft-start period. After 1ms dela y of the soft-start period, PG \nbecomes high impedance as long as the output voltage is within the \nnominal regulation voltage set by VFB. When VFB drops 15% below \nor raises 0.8V above the nominal regulation voltage, the ISL8026, ISL8026A pulls PG low. Any fault condition forces PG low until the \nfault condition is cleared by attempts to soft-start. For logic level \noutput voltages, connect an external pull-up resistor, R\n1, between \nPG and VIN. A 100k Ω resistor works well in most applications.\nUVLO\nWhen the input voltage is below the Undervoltage Lockout \n(UVLO) threshold, the regulator is disabled. Soft Start-Up\nThe soft start-up reduces the inru sh current during the start-up. \nThe soft-start block outputs a ramp reference to the input of the \nerror amplifier. This voltage ramp  limits the inductor current as \nwell as the output voltage speed, so that the output voltage rises \nin a controlled fashion. When VFB is less than 0.1V at the \nbeginning of the soft-start, the sw itching frequency is reduced to \n200kHz, so that the output can start-up smoothly at light load \ncondition. During soft-start, the IC operates in the Skip mode to \nsupport prebiased output condition. \nTie SS to SGND for internal soft-start, which is approximately \n1ms. Connect a capacitor from SS to SGND to adjust the \nsoft-start time. This capacitor,  along with an internal 1.85µA \ncurrent source sets the soft-start  interval of the converter, t SS, as \nshown by Equation 3 .\nCSS must be less than 33nF to insure proper soft-start reset after \nfault condition.\nEnable\nThe Enable (EN) input allows the user to control the turning on or off \nof the regulator for purposes such as power-up sequencing. When \nthe regulator is enabled, there is typically a 600µs delay for waking \nup the bandgap reference and then the soft start-up begins. \nDischarge Mode (Soft-Stop)\nWhen a transition to shutdown mode occurs or the VIN UVLO is \nset, the outputs discharge to GND through an internal 100 Ω \nswitch. \nPower MOSFETs\nThe power MOSFETs are optimized for best efficiency. The \nON-resistance for the P-FET is typically 36m Ω and the \nON-resistance for the N-FET is typically 13m Ω. \n100% Duty Cycle\nThe ISL8026, ISL8026A features a 100% duty cycle operation to \nmaximize the battery life. When the battery voltage drops to a \nlevel that the ISL8026, ISL8026A  can no longer maintain the \nregulation at the output, the re gulator completely turns on the \nP-FET. The maximum dropout voltage under the 100% duty cycle \noperation is the product of the load current and the \nON-resistance of the P-FET. \nThermal Shutdown\nThe ISL8026, ISL8026A has built-in  thermal protection. When the \ninternal temperature reaches +150°C, the regulator is completely \nshut down. As the temperature drops to +125°C, the ISL8026, \nISL8026A resumes operation by st epping through the soft-start.

The \ntemperature rise is given by Equation 4 : \nWhere PD is the power dissipated by the regulator and θJA is the \nthermal resistance from the junc tion of the die to the ambient \ntemperature. The junction temperature, T J, is given by \nEquation 5 :\nWhere T A is the ambient temperature. For the TQFN package, the \nθJA is 47 (°C/W).\nThe actual junction temperature should not exceed the absolute \nmaximum junction temperature of +125°C when considering \nthe thermal design. \nApplication Information \nOutput Inductor and Capacitor Selection\nTo consider steady state and transient operations, the ISL8026 \ntypically uses a 1.0µH output inductor and the ISL8026A uses a 0.68µH output inductor. The higher or lower inductor value can \nbe used to optimize the total converter system performance. For \nexample, for a higher output voltag e 3.3V application, in order to \ndecrease the inductor current ripple and output voltage ripple, \nthe output inductor value can be increased. It is recommended to \nset the ripple inductor curr ent approximately 30% of the \nmaximum output current for optimized performance. The \ninductor ripple current can be expressed, as shown in Equation 6\n:\nThe inductor’s saturation current rating needs to be at least \nlarger than the peak current. The ISL8026, ISL8026A protects \nthe typical peak current 9A. The saturation current needs to be \nover 10A for maximum output current application.The ISL8026, ISL8026A uses an internal compensation network \nand the output capacitor value is dependent on the output voltage. The ceramic capacitor is recommended to be X5R or \nX7R. The recommended X5R or X7R minimum output capacitor \nvalues are shown in Table 3 on page 4\n.\nIn Table 3 , the minimum output capacitor value is given for the \ndifferent output voltages to ensure that the whole converter \nsystem is stable. Additional output capacitance should be added \nfor better performance in applications where high load transient \nor low output ripple is required. It is recommended to check the system level performance along with the simulation model.\nOutput Voltage Selection\nThe output voltage of the regulator can be programmed via an \nexternal resistor divider that is used to scale the output voltage, \nrelative to the internal reference voltage, and feed it back to the inverting input of the error amplifier (refer to Figure 1 on page 1\n).\nThe output voltage programming resistor, R 2, will depend on the \nvalue chosen for the feedback resistor and the desired output voltage of the regulator. The value for the feedback resistor, R\n3, \nis typically between 10k Ω and 100k Ω, as shown in Equation 7 . \nIf the output voltage desired is 0.6V, then R 3 is left unpopulated \nand R 2 is shorted. There is a leakage current from V IN to PHASE. \nIt is recommended to preload the output with 10µA minimum. \nFor better performance, add 22pF in parallel with R 2 (200kΩ). \nCheck loop analysis before use in application.\nInput Capacitor Selection\nThe main functions for the input capacitor are to provide \ndecoupling of the parasitic indu ctance and provide a filtering \nfunction to prevent the switching current flowing back to the battery rail. At least two 22µF X5R or X7R ceramic capacitors are \na good starting point for th e input capacitor selection. \nLoop Compensation Design\nWhen COMP is not connected to VIN, the COMP pin is active for \nexternal loop compensation. The ISL8026, ISL8026A uses constant frequency peak current mode control architecture to \nachieve a fast loop transient response. An accurate current \nsensing pilot device in parallel with the upper MOSFET is used for peak current control signal an d overcurrent protection. The \ninductor is not considered as a state variable since its peak \ncurrent is constant and the system becomes a single order \nsystem. It is much easier to design a type II compensator to \nstabilize the loop than to implem ent voltage mode control. Peak \ncurrent mode control has an inherent input voltage feed-forward \nfunction to achieve go od line regulation.

It is shown that it has a 150kHz loop bandwidth with a 42° phase margin and 10dB gain margin.

For the ISL8026, \nISL8026A, the power loop is compos ed of the output inductor L’s, \nthe output capacitor (C OUT), the PHASE pins and the PGND pin. It \nis necessary to make the power loop as small as possible and \nthe connecting traces among them  should be direct, short and \nwide. The switching node of the converter, the PHASE pins and \nthe traces connected to the node  are very noisy, so keep the \nvoltage feedback trace away from these noisy traces. The input \ncapacitor should be placed as close as possible to the VIN pin. \nThe ground of input and output capacitors should be connected as close as possible. The heat of the IC is mainly dissipated \nthrough the thermal pad. Maximizing the copper area connected \nto the thermal pad is preferable. In addition, a solid ground plane is helpful for better EMI performance. It is recommended to add \nat least 5 vias ground connectio n within the pad for the best \nthermal relief.\nFIGURE 58.
