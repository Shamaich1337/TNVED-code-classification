The special purpose unbuffered circuit design is intended for\ncrystal oscillator or analog applications. The internal circuit consistsof only one −stage, the output, to allow for this part to be used in these\noscillator or analog applications. The device is fabricated withadvanced CMOS technology to achieve ultra high speed with highoutput drive while maintaining low static power dissipation over avery broad V\nCC operating range. The device is specified to operate\nover the 1.65 V to 5.5 V V CC range. The inputs are high impedance\nwhen V CC is 0 V . Inputs tolerate voltages up to 5.5 V independent of\nVCC operating voltage.\nFeatures\n•Space−Saving SC −88 6−Lead Package\n•Ultra−Small MicroPak ™ Leadless Packages\n•Unbuffered for Crystal Oscillator  and Analog Applications\n•Balanced Output Drive: ±32 mA at 4.5 V V CC\n•Balanced Output Drive: ±8 mA at 4.5 V V CC\n(NC7WZU04P6X −L22347)\n•Broad V CC Operating Range: 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n•Low Quiescent Power: I CC < 1 /C0109A at 5 V V CC, TA = 25 °C\n•These Devices are Pb −Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free and are RoHS\nCompliant\nFigure 1.
