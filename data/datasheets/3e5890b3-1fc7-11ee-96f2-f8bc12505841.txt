The fabric consists of LEs, made of 4-input look up tables (LUTs), memory \nblocks, and multipliers.\nEach Cyclone IV device M9K memory block provides 9 Kbits of embedded SRAM \nmemory. You can configure the M9K blocks as single port, simple dual port, or true \ndual port RAM, as well as FIFO buffers or ROM. They can also be configured to \nimplement any of the data widths in Table 1–7 .\nThe multiplier architecture in Cyclone IV devices is the same as in the existing \nCyclone series devices. The embedded multiplier blocks can implement an 18 × 18 or \ntwo 9 × 9 multipliers in a single block. Altera offers a complete suite of DSP IP \nincluding finite impulse response (FIR), fast Fourier transform (FFT), and numerically \ncontrolled oscillator (NCO) functions fo r use with the multiplier blocks. The \nQuartus®II design software’s DSP Builder tool integrates MathWorks Simulink and \nMATLAB design environments for a streamlined DSP design flow. \nf For more information, refer to the Logic Elements and Logic Array Blocks in Cyclone IV \nDevices , Memory Blocks in Cyclone IV Devices , and Embedded Multipliers in Cyclone IV \nDevices  chapters.Table 1–7.

Cyclone IV devices \nsupport calibrated on-chip se ries termination (Rs OCT) or driver impedance matching \n(Rs) for single-ended I/O standards. In Cyclone IV GX devices, the high-speed \ntransceiver I/Os are located on the left side of the device. The top, bottom, and right \nsides can implement general-purpose user I/Os.\nTable 1–8  lists the I/O standards that Cyclone IV devices support.\nThe LVDS SERDES is implemented in the core of the device using logic elements.\nf For more information, refer to the I/O Features in Cyclone IV Devices  chapter.\nClock Management\nCyclone IV devices include up to 30 global clock (GCLK) networks and up to eight \nPLLs with five outputs per PLL to provide robust clock management and synthesis. You can dynamically reconfigur e Cyclone IV device PLLs in user mode to change the \nclock frequency or phase.\nCyclone IV GX devices support two types of  PLLs: multipurpose PLLs and general-\npurpose PLLs:\n■Use multipurpose PLLs for clocking the tr ansceiver blocks. You can also use them \nfor general-purpose clocking when they are not used for transceiver clocking.\n■Use general purpose PLLs for general-purpose applications in the fabric and \nperiphery, such as external memory inte rfaces. Some of the general purpose PLLs \ncan support transceiver clocking. \nf For more information, refer to the Clock Networks and PLLs in Cyclone IV Devices  \nchapter.\nExternal Memory Interfaces\nCyclone IV devices support SDR, DDR, DDR2 SDRAM, and QDRII SRAM interfaces \non the top, bottom, and right sides of the device. Cyclone IV E devices also support \nthese interfaces on the left side of the device. Interfaces may span two or more sides of the device to allow more flexible board design. The Altera\n® DDR SDRAM memory \ninterface solution consists of a PHY interfac e and a memory controller. Altera supplies \nthe PHY IP and you can use it in conj unction with your own custom memory \ncontroller or an Altera-provided memory controller. Cyclone IV devices support the \nuse of error correction coding (ECC) bits on DDR and DDR2 SDRAM interfaces.Table 1–8.

Co nfiguration data is \ndownloaded to the Cyclone IV device each time the device powers up. Low-cost \nconfiguration options include the Altera EPCS family serial flash devices and \ncommodity parallel flash configuration opti ons. These options provide the flexibility \nfor general-purpose applications and the ability to meet specific configuration and \nwake-up time requirements of the applications.\nTable 1–9  lists which configuration schemes are supported by Cyclone IV devices.\nIEEE 1149.6 (AC JTAG) is supported on all transceiver I/O pins. All other pins \nsupport IEEE 1149.1 (JTAG) for boundary scan testing.\nf For more information, refer to the JTAG Boundary-Scan Testing for Cyclone IV Devices  \nchapter.\nFor Cyclone IV GX devices to meet the PCIe  100 ms wake-up time requirement, you \nmust use passive serial (PS) configurat ion mode for the EP4CGX15/22/30 devices \nand use fast passive parallel (FPP) conf iguration mode for the EP4CGX30F484 and \nEP4CGX50/75/110/150 devices.\nf For more information, refer to the Configuration and Remote  System Upgrades in \nCyclone IV Devices  chapter.\nThe cyclical redundancy check (CRC) error detection feature during user mode is \nsupported in all Cyclone IV GX devices. For Cy clone IV E devices, this feature is only \nsupported for the devices with the core voltage of 1.2 V .\nf For more information about CRC error detection, refer to the SEU Mitigation in \nCyclone IV Devices  chapter.\nHigh-Speed Transceivers (C yclone IV GX Devices Only)\nCyclone IV GX devices contain up to eight fu ll duplex high-speed transceivers that \ncan operate independently. These blocks  support multiple industry-standard \ncommunication protocols, as well as Ba sic mode, which you can use to implement \nyour own proprietary protocols. Each tran sceiver channel has its own pre-emphasis \nand equalization circuitry, which you can set at compile time to optimize signal \nintegrity and reduce bit error rates. Transceiver blocks also support dynamic \nreconfiguration, allowing you to change  data rates and protocols on-the-fly.Table 1–9.
