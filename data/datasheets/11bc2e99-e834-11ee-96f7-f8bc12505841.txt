General description\nThe 74HC165; 74HCT165 are 8-bit serial or parallel-in/serial-out shift registers. The device\nfeatures a serial data input (DS), eight parallel data inputs (D0 to D7) and two complementary\nserial outputs (Q7 and Q7). When the parallel load input ( PL) is LOW the data from D0 to D7 is\nloaded into the shift register asynchronously. When PL is HIGH data enters the register serially at\nDS. When the clock enable input ( CE) is LOW data is shifted on the LOW-to-HIGH transitions of\nthe CP input. A HIGH on CE will disable the CP input. Inputs are overvoltage tolerant to 15 V. This\nenables the device to be used in HIGH-to-LOW level shifting applications.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 2.0 to 6.0 V\n•CMOS low power dissipation\n•High noise immunity\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78 Class II Level B\n•Asynchronous 8-bit parallel load\n•Synchronous serial input\n•Input levels:\n•For 74HC165: CMOS level\n•For 74HCT165: TTL level\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•JESD7A (2.0 V to 6.0 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and from -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

#### Description:
The **74HC165** is an **8-bit parallel-in/serial-out shift register** designed for high-speed data processing. It allows for the parallel loading of data into the register when the parallel load input (PL) is LOW, and serial data can be shifted out through the serial output (Q7) when PL is HIGH. The device features a clock input (CP) that triggers data shifting on the LOW-to-HIGH transitions, and a clock enable input (CE) that can disable the clock input.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Data Conversion**: The 74HC165 is commonly used for converting parallel data to serial data, making it suitable for applications where data needs to be transmitted over a single line.
- **Microcontroller Interfaces**: It can interface with microcontrollers to expand the number of input/output pins available for reading multiple signals.
- **Level Shifting**: Due to its overvoltage tolerant inputs, it can be used in applications requiring level shifting between different voltage domains.
- **Data Acquisition Systems**: It is useful in systems that require the collection of multiple data points simultaneously and then processing them serially.

This component is ideal for applications in consumer electronics, industrial automation, and communication systems where efficient data handling is crucial.
