The device integrates Analog Devices, Inc.,\niCoupler® technology, enhanced for high speed operation to pro-\nvide drop-in galvanic isolation of LVDS signal chains. AC coupling\nand/or level shifting to the LVDS receivers and from the LVDS\ndrivers allows isolation of other high speed signals such as current\nmode logic (CML).\nThe ADN4624  includes a refresh mechanism to monitor the input\nand output states and ensure they remain the same in the absence\nof data transitions (for example, at power-on).\nFor lower power consumption and high speed operation with low\njitter, the LVDS and isolator circuits rely on 1.8 V supplies. The\nADN4624  is fully specified over a wide industrial temperature range\nand is available in a 28-lead, wide-body, finer pitch SOIC_W_FP\npackage with 8.3 mm creepage and clearance  (for 5.7 kV rms or 8\nkVPEAK surge and impulse voltages and reinforced insulation at ac\nmains voltages) or 6 mm × 6 mm LFCSP package with 1.27 mm\ncreepage and clearance  (for basic/functional isolation).\n1Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952,849; 6,873,065; 6,903,578; and 7,075,329.

A | 18 of 23The ADN4624  is a high speed differential signal isolator capable\nof switching up to 2.5 Gbps with signal levels compliant to TIA/\nEIA-644-A. The device couples differential signals applied to the\nLVDS receiver inputs across the isolation barrier to the outputs on\nthe other side and re-transmits the bit stream or clock as LVDS.\nThis integration allows drop-in isolation of LVDS signal chains and\nisolation of other signals such as CML.\nThe LVDS receiver detects the differential voltage present across a\ntermination resistor on an LVDS input. An integrated digital isolator\ntransmits the input state across the isolation barrier, and an LVDS\ndriver outputs the same state as the input.\nWhen there is a positive differential voltage of ≥100 mV across\na termination resistor between any DINx+ pin and a corresponding\nDINx− pin, the corresponding DOUTx+ pin sources current. This cur-\nrent flows across the connected transmission line and termination\nat the receiver at the far end of the bus, while DOUTx − sinks the\nreturn current. When there is a negative differential voltage of\n≤−100 mV across any DINx± pin, the corresponding DOUTx+ pin sinks\ncurrent with the DOUTx − pin sourcing the current. Table 20  shows\nthese input and output combinations.\nThe output drive current is between ±2.5 mA and ±4.5 mA (typically\n±3.1 mA), developing between ±250 mV and ±450 mV across a\n100 Ω termination resistor (RT). The received voltage is centered\naround 1.2 V. Because the differential voltage (VID) reverses polari-\nty, the peak-to-peak voltage swing across RT is twice the differential\nvoltage magnitude (|VID|).ISOLATION AND REFRESH\nIn response to any change in the input state detected by the\nintegrated LVDS receiver, an encoder circuit sends narrow (~1 ns)\npulses to a decoder circuit using integrated transformer coils. The\ndecoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the\npulses that indicate input transitions. The decoder state determines\nthe LVDS driver output state in normal operation, which reflects the\nisolated LVDS buffer input state.\nFor normal operation of the ADN4624, the active low enable pins,\nREFRESH1 and REFRESH2, are shorted to GND1 and GND2,\nrespectively, to enable a refresh function. When enabled, this\nfunction means that in the absence of input transitions for more\nthan approximately 1 µs, a periodic set of refresh pulses, indicative\nof the correct input state, ensures dc correctness at the output\n(including the fail-safe output state, if applicable).\nOn power-up, the output state may initially be in the incorrect dc\nstate if there are no input transitions. The output state is corrected\nwithin 1 µs by the refresh pulses.\nIf the decoder receives no internal pulses for more than approxi-\nmately 1 µs, the device assumes that the input side is unpowered\nor nonfunctional, in which case, the output is set to a positive\ndifferential voltage (logic high).\nFor clocks, constant bit streams, or protocols with error correction,\nthe refresh functionality may not be required. If REFRESH1 and\nREFRESH2 are shorted to VDD1 and VDD2, respectively, the\nrefresh functionality is disabled, allowing for lower power operation\nwith no internal clock-like signals (potentially reducing conducted or\nradiated emissions). In this mode of operation, a new data transition\nat the input may be required to correct the output state, either\nafter power-up or after a common-mode transient event beyond the\nguaranteed common-mode transient immunity specification.\nTRUTH TABLE\nThe LVDS standard, TIA/EIA-644-A, defines normal receiver opera-\ntion under two conditions: an input differential voltage of ≥+100 mV\ncorresponding to one logic state, and a voltage of ≤−100 mV for\nthe other logic state. Between these thresholds, the standard LVDS\nreceiver operation is undefined (the LVDS receiver can detect either\nstate), as shown in Table 20 .\nTable 20.

A | 19 of 23PCB LAYOUT\nThe ADN4624  can operate with high speed LVDS signals up to\n1.25 GHz clock, or 2.5 Gbps nonreturn to zero (NRZ) data. When\noperating with such high frequencies, apply best practices for the\nLVDS trace layout and termination. Place a 100 Ω termination\nresistor as close as possible to the receiver, across the DINx+ and\nDINx− pins.\nControlled impedance traces (100 Ω differential) are needed on\nLVDS signal lines for full signal integrity, reduced system jitter, and\nfor minimizing electromagnetic interference (EMI) from the PCB.\nTrace widths, lateral distance within each pair, and distance to the\nground plane underneath all must be chosen appropriately. Via\nfencing to the PCB ground between pairs is also a best practice to\nminimize crosstalk between adjacent pairs.\nThe ADN4624  pass EN 55032 Class B emissions limits without\nextra considerations required for the isolator when operating with\nup to 2 Gbps PRBS data. When isolating at higher data rates or for\nhigh speed clocks, specific PCB layout measures may be required\nto reduce dipole antenna effects from the isolation gap and provide\nsufficient margin below Class B emissions limits.\nThe best practice for high speed PCB design avoids emissions from\ntraces with high speed LVDS signals. Special care is recommended\nfor off board connections, where switching transients from high\nspeed LVDS signals (and clocks in particular) may conduct onto ca-\nbling, resulting in radiated emissions. Use common-mode chokes,\nferrites, or other filters as appropriate at LVDS connectors and\npower supplies, as well as cable shield or PCB ground connections\nto earth or chassis.\nThe ADN4624  requires appropriate decoupling of the VDDx pins\nwith 100 nF capacitors. Power supplies must also have appropriate\nfiltering to avoid possible radiated emissions due to high frequency\nswitching noise.\nAPPLICATION EXAMPLES\nHigh speed LVDS interfaces for the analog front-end (AFE), pro-\ncessor to processor serial communication, or video and imagingdata can be isolated using the ADN4624 between components,\nbetween boards, or at a cable interface.\nThe ADN4624 provides the galvanic isolation required for robust\nexternal ports, and the low jitter and high drive strength of the\ndevice allow communication along short cable runs of a few\nmeters. High common-mode immunity ensures communication in-\ntegrity even in harsh, noisy environments, and isolation can pro-\ntect against electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) transients up to\n±8 kVPEAK, such as ESD, electrical fast transient (EFT), and surge.\nStandard LVDS inputs and outputs allow simple integration into\nhigh speed signal chains using field-programmable gate arrays\n(FPGAs), redrivers, or coupling networks to interface to CML and\nother physical layers. The ADN4624 can isolate a range of video\nand imaging protocols, including protocols that use CML rather than\nLVDS for the physical layer.\nOne example is High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), where\nac coupling and biasing and termination resistor networks are used,\nas shown in Figure 32  to convert between CML (used by the\ntransition minimized differential signaling (TMDS) data and clock\nlanes) and the LVDS levels required by the ADN4624. Additional\nAnalog Devices isolator components, such as the ADuM2250  and\nADuM2251  I2C isolators, can be used to isolate control signals and\npower ( ADuM6421A  and ADuM6028  isoPower integrated, isolated\ndc-to-dc converter). This circuit supports resolutions up to 1080p.\nOther coupling networks, processing nodes, and translation circuits\ncan use the ADN4624 as part of an overall signal chain to iso-\nlate MIPI CSI-2, DisplayPort, and LVDS-based protocols such as\nFPD-Link. Use of an FPGA or an application-specific integrated\ncircuit (ASIC) serializer/deserializer (SERDES) expands bandwidth\nthrough multiple ADN4624 devices to support 1080p or 4K video\nresolutions, providing an alternative to short reach fiber links.\nData Sheet ADN4624\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. A | 20 of 23Figure 32. Example Isolated Video Interface (HDMI) Using the ADN4624\nMAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY\nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the device is set\nby the condition in which the induced voltage in the transformer\nreceiving coil is sufficiently large, either to falsely set or reset\nthe decoder. The following analysis defines such conditions. The\nADN4624  is examined in a 1.7 V operating condition because\nthis operating condition represents the most susceptible mode of\noperation for these products.\nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater\nthan 0.35 V. The decoder has a sensing threshold of about 0.11 V,\ntherefore establishing a 0.24 V margin in which induced voltages\nare tolerated.The voltage (V) induced across the receiving coil is given by\nV = (−dβ/dt)∑πrn2; n = 1, 2, …, N (1)\nwhere:\ndβ is the change in magnetic flux density.\ndt is the change in time.\nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil.\nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.\nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADN4624  and an\nimposed requirement that the induced voltage be, at most, 50% of\nthe 0.11 V threshold at the decoder, a maximum allowable external\nmagnetic flux density is calculated as shown in Figure 33 .\nData Sheet ADN4624\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. A | 21 of 23Figure 33. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density\nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum\nallowable magnetic field of 1.06 kgauss induces a voltage of 0.055\nV at the receiving coil. This voltage is about 50% of the sensing\nthreshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. If such an\nevent occurs with the worst case polarity during a transmitted pulse,\nthe applied magnetic field reduces the received pulse from >0.35 V\nto 0.295 V. This voltage is still higher than the 0.11 V sensing\nthreshold of the decoder.\nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to specific\ncurrent magnitudes at given distances from the ADN4624  trans-\nformers. Figure 34  expresses these allowable current magnitudes\nas a function of frequency for selected distances. The ADN4624  is\ninsensitive to external fields. Only extremely large, high frequency\ncurrents that are close to the component can potentially be a\nconcern. For the 1 MHz example noted, a 2.64 kA current must be\nplaced 5 mm from the ADN4624  to affect component operation.\nFigure 34. Maximum Allowable Current for Various Current to ADN4624\nSpacingsIn combinations of strong magnetic field and high frequency, any\nloops formed by PCB traces can induce sufficiently large error\nvoltages to trigger the thresholds of succeeding circuitry. Avoid PCB\nstructures that form loops.\nINSULATION LIFETIME\nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected to\nvoltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insulation\ndegradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage\nwaveform applied across the insulation as well as on the materials\nand material interfaces.\nThe two types of insulation degradation of primary interest are\nbreakdown along surfaces exposed to the air and insulation wear\nout. Surface breakdown is the phenomenon of surface tracking\nand the primary determinant of surface creepage requirements in\nsystem level standards. Insulation wear out is the phenomenon\nwhere charge injection or displacement currents inside the insula-\ntion material cause long-term insulation degradation.\nSurface Tracking\nSurface tracking is addressed in electrical safety standards by\nsetting a minimum surface creepage based on the working voltage,\nthe environmental conditions, and the properties of the insulation\nmaterial. Safety agencies perform characterization testing on the\nsurface insulation of components, which allows the components to\nbe categorized in different material groups. Lower material group\nratings are more resistant to surface tracking and, therefore, can\nprovide adequate lifetime with smaller creepage. The minimum\ncreepage for a given working voltage and material group is in\neach system level standard and is based on the total rms voltage\nacross the isolation barrier, pollution degree, and material group.\nThe material group and creepage for ADN4624  are detailed in\nTable 5 .\nInsulation Wear Out\nThe lifetime of insulation caused by wear out is determined by\nthe thickness of the insulation, material properties, and the voltage\nstress applied. It is important to verify that the product lifetime is\nadequate at the application working voltage. The working voltage\nsupported by an isolator for wear out may not be the same as\nthe working voltage supported for tracking. The working voltage\napplicable to tracking is specified in most standards.\nTesting and modeling show that the primary driver of long-term deg-\nradation is displacement current in the polyimide insulation causing\nincremental damage. The stress on the insulation can be broken\ndown into broad categories, such as dc stress, which causes little\nwear out because there is no displacement current, and an ac\ncomponent time varying voltage stress, which causes wear out.\nThe ratings in certification documents are usually based on 60 Hz\nsinusoidal stress because this type of waveform reflects isolation\nfrom line voltage. However, many practical applications have com-\nData Sheet ADN4624\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. A | 22 of 23binations of 60 Hz ac and dc across the isolation barrier, as shown\nin Equation 1. Because only the ac portion of the stress causes\nwear out, the equation can be rearranged to solve for the ac rms\nvoltage, as shown in Equation 2. For insulation wear out with\nthe polyimide materials used in this product, the ac rms voltage\ndetermines the product lifetime.\nV RMS = V AC RMS2 + V DC2 (1)\nor\nV AC RMS = V R MS2 − V D C2 (2)\nwhere:\nVRMS is the total rms working voltage.\nVAC RMS  is the time varying portion of the working voltage.\nVDC is the dc offset of the working voltage.\nCalculation and Use of Parameters Example\nThe following example frequently arises in power conversion appli-\ncations. Assume that the line voltage on one side of the isolation\nis 240 V ac rms and a 400 V dc bus voltage is present on the\nother side of the isolation barrier. The isolator material is polyimide.\nTo establish the critical voltages in determining the creepage, clear-\nance, and lifetime of a device, see Figure 35  and the following\nequations.\nThe working voltage across the barrier from Equation 1 is\nV RMS = V AC RMS2 + V DC2 (2)\nV RMS = 2402+ 4002(3)\nVRMS = 466 VThis VRMS value is the working voltage used together with the\nmaterial group and pollution degree when looking up the creepage\nrequired by a system standard.\nTo determine if the lifetime is adequate, obtain the time varying\nportion of the working voltage. To obtain the ac rms voltage, use\nEquation 2.\nV AC RM S = V RMS2 − V D C2 (4)\nV AC RMS \xa0 = 4662− 4002(5)\nVAC RMS  = 240 V rms\nIn this case, the ac rms voltage is simply the line voltage of\n240 V rms. This calculation is more relevant when the waveform\nis not sinusoidal. Table 14  compares the value to the limits for the\nworking voltage for the expected lifetime. Note that the dc working\nvoltage limit in Table 14  is set by the creepage of the package as\nspecified in IEC 60664-1. This value can differ for specific system\nlevel standards.\nFigure 35.
