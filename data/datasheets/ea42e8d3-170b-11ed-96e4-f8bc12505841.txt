All rights reserved. ●Cautions on use \n \n1) Absolute Ma ximum Ratings \nAn excess in the absolute maximum ratings, such as supply vo ltage ( Vmax ), temperature range of operating conditions \n( Topr ), etc., can break down devices, t hus making impossible to identify breaking mode such as a short circuit or an open \ncircuit. If any special mode exceeding the absolute maximum ratings is assumed, consideration should be given to take \nphysical safety measures incl uding the use of fuses, etc. \n \n2) GND voltage \nMake setting of the potential of the GND terminal so that it will be maintained at the minimum in any operating state. \nFurthermore, check to be sure no terminals are at a potential  lower than the GND voltage including an actual electric \ntransient. \n \n3) Short circuit between terminals and erroneous mounting \nIn order to mount ICs on a set PCB, pay thorough attention to  the direction and offset of t he ICs. Erroneous mounting can \nbreak down the ICs. Furthermore, if a short circuit occurs  due to foreign matters entering between terminals or between \nthe terminal and the power supply or t he GND terminal, the ICs can break down. \n \n4) Operation in strong electromagnetic field \nBe noted that using ICs in the strong elec tromagnetic field can malfunction them. \n \n5) Inspection with set PCB  \nOn the inspection with the set PCB, if a capacitor is connec ted to a low-impedance IC terminal, the IC can suffer stress. \nTherefore, be sure to discharge from the set PCB by each proc ess. Furthermore, in order to mount or dismount the set \nPCB to/from the jig for the inspection process, be sure to tu rn OFF the power supply and then mount the set PCB to the jig. \nAfter the completion of the inspection, be sure to turn OFF the power supply and then dismount it from the jig. In addition, \nfor protection against static electricity,  establish a ground for the assembly pr ocess and pay thorough attention to the \ntransportation and the stor age of the set PCB. \n \n6) Input terminals \nIn terms of the construction of IC, parasitic elements are inev itably formed in relation to potential. The operation of the \nparasitic element can cause interference with circuit operation,  thus resulting in a malfunct ion and then breakdown of the \ninput terminal. Therefore, pay thorough attention not to handle t he input terminals; such as to apply to the input terminals a \nvoltage lower than the GND respectively, so  that any parasitic element will operate.  Furthermore, do not apply a voltage to \nthe input terminals when no power supply voltage is applied to the IC. In addition, even if the power supply voltage is \napplied, apply to the input terminals a volt age lower than the power supply voltag e or within the guaranteed value of \nelectrical characteristics.  \n7) Thermal design \nPerform thermal design in which there are adequate margins by taking into account the power dissipation ( Pd ) in actual \nstates of use. \n \n8) Treatment of package \nDusts or scratch on the photo detector may affect the optical characterist ics. Please handle it with care. \n \n9) Rush current \nWhen power is first supplied to the CMOS IC, it is possible t hat the internal logic may be unstable and rush current may \nflow instantaneously. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of GND \nwiring, and routing of connections.  \n10) The exposed central pad on the back side of the package \nThere is an exposed central pad on the back side of the packa ge. But please do it non connection. ( Don\'t  solder, and \ndon\'t do electrical connection ) Please mount by Footprint dim ensions described in the Jisso Information for WSOF6I. This \npad is GND level, therefore ther e is a possibility that LSI malfunc tions and heavy-current is generated. \n \nBH1750FVI  Technical Note \n17/17 www.rohm.com 2011.11 - Rev.D\n© 2011 ROHM Co., Ltd.
