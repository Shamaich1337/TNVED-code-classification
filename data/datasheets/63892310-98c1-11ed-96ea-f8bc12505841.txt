The on-chip VCO tunes from 2.55 GHz \nto 2.95 GHz. Optionally, an external VCO/VCXO of up to \n2.4 GHz can be used. \nThe AD9517-0  emphasizes low jitter and phase noise to \nmaximize data converter performance, and it can benefit other \napplications with demanding phase noise and jitter requirements.

Each LVDS output can \nbe reconfigured as two CMOS outputs. The LVPECL outputs \noperate to 1.6 GHz, the LVDS outputs operate to 800 MHz, and \nthe CMOS outputs operate to 250 MHz. \nFor applications that require additional outputs, a crystal reference \ninput, zero-delay, or EEPROM for automatic configuration at startup, the AD9520 and AD9522  are available. In addition, \nthe AD9516 and AD9518 are similar to the AD9517 but have \na different combination of outputs. \nEach pair of outputs has dividers that allow both the divide ratio \nand coarse delay (or phase) to be set. The range of division for \nthe LVPECL outputs is 1 to 32. The LVDS/CMOS outputs \nallow a range of divisions up to a maximum of 1024. \nThe AD9517-0  is available in a 48-lead LFCSP and can be \noperated from a single 3.3 V supply. An external VCO, which \nrequires an extended voltage range, can be accommodated by connecting the charge pump supply (VCP) to 5 V. A separate LVPECL power supply can be from 2.5 V to 3.3 V (nominal). \nThe AD9517-0  is specified for operat ion over the industrial \nrange of −40°C to +85°C.  \n \n1 AD9517 is used throughout the data sheet to refer to all the members of the \nAD9517 family. However, when AD9517-0 is used, it refers to that specific \nmember of the AD9517 family. \n \nAD9517-0 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

F | Page 26 of 80 TERMINOLOGY \nPhase Jitter and Phase Noise \nAn ideal sine wave can be thought of as having a continuous and even progression of phase with time from 0° to 360° for each cycle. Actual signals, however, display a certain amount  of variation from ideal phase progression over time. This \nphenomenon is called phase jitter. Although many causes can \ncontribute to phase jitter, one major cause is random noise, \nwhich is characterized statistically as being Gaussian (normal) in distribution.  \nThis phase jitter leads to a spre ading out of the energy of the \nsine wave in the frequency domain, producing a continuous \npower spectrum. This power spectrum is usually reported as a series of values whose units are dBc/Hz at a given offset in \nfrequency from the sine wave (carrier). The value is a ratio \n(expressed in dB) of the power contained within a 1 Hz bandwidth with respect to the power at the carrier frequency. For each measurement, the offset from the carrier frequency is also given.  \nIt is meaningful to integrate the total power contained within \nsome interval of offset frequencies (for example, 10 kHz to \n10 MHz). This is called the integrated phase noise over that \nfrequency offset interval and can be readily related to the time jitter due to the phase noise within that offset frequency interval. \nPhase noise has a detrimental e ffect on the performance of \nADCs, DACs, and RF mixers. It lowers the achievable dynamic \nrange of the converters and mixers, although they are affected \nin somewhat different ways. Time Jitter Phase noise is a frequency doma in phenomenon. In the time \ndomain, the same effect is exhibited as time jitter. When observing a sine wave, the time of successive zero crossings \nvaries. In a square wave, the time jitter is a displacement of the \nedges from their ideal (regular) times of occurrence. In both \ncases, the variations in timing from the ideal are the time jitter. Because these variations are random in nature, the time jitter is specified in units of seconds root mean square (rms) or 1 sigma \nof the Gaussian distribution. \nTime jitter that occurs on a sampling clock for a DAC or an \nADC decreases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and dynamic \nrange of the converter. A sampling clock with the lowest possible jitter provides the highest performance from a given converter. \nAdditive Phase Noise Additive phase noise is the am ount of phase noise that can \nbe attributed to the device or subsystem being measured. \nThe phase noise of any external oscillators or clock sources is subtracted. This makes it possible to predict the degree to \nwhich the device impacts the total system phase noise when \nused in conjunction with the various oscillators and clock sources, each of which contributes its own phase noise to the total. In many cases, the phase noise of one element dominates the system phase noise. When th ere are multiple contributors \nto phase noise, the total is the square root of the sum of squares of the individual contributors. \nAdditive Time Jitter Additive time jitter is the amount of time jitter that can \nbe attributed to the device or subsystem being measured. The time jitter of any external oscillat ors or clock sources is subtracted. \nThis makes it possible to predict the degree to which the device impacts the total system time jitter when used in conjunction with the various oscillators and clock so urces, each of which contributes \nits own time jitter to the total. In many cases, the time jitter of the external oscillators and cloc k sources dominates the system \ntime jitter. \n \nData Sheet AD9517-0\n \nRev.

Detailed Block Diagram \nAD9517-0 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 28 of 80 THEORY OF OPERATION \nOPERATIONAL CONFIGURATIONS \nThe AD9517 can be configured in several ways. These \nconfigurations must be set up by loading the control registers \n(see Table 52 and Table 53 through Table 62). Each section or \nfunction must be individua lly programmed by setting the \nappropriate bits in the corresponding  control register or registers. \nHigh Frequency Clock Distribution—CLK or External \nVCO > 1600 MHz \nThe AD9517 power-up default configuration has the PLL \npowered off and the routing of the input set so that the \nCLK/ CLK  input is connected to the distribution section \nthrough the VCO divider (divide-by-2/ divide-by-3/divide-by-4/ \ndivide-by-5/divide-by-6). This is a distribution-only mode that allows for an external input up to 2400 MHz (see Table 3). The maximum frequency that can be applied to the channel dividers \nis 1600 MHz; therefore, higher  input frequencies must be \ndivided down before reaching the channel dividers. This input \nrouting can also be used for lo wer input frequencies, but the \nminimum divide is 2 before the channel dividers. \nWhen the PLL is enabled, this routing also allows the use of the \nPLL with an external VCO or VCXO  with a frequency of less than \n2400 MHz. In this configuration, the internal VCO is not used \nand is powered off. The external VCO/VCXO feeds directly into the prescaler. \nThe register settings shown in Table 21 are the default values of \nthese registers at power-up or after a reset operation. If the \ncontents of the registers are al tered by prior programming after \npower-up or reset, these registers can also be set intentionally to \nthese values.  \nAfter the appropriate register values are programmed, \nRegister 0x232 must be set to 0x01 for the values to take effect.

PLL Functional Blocks \nThe AD9517 includes an on-chip PLL with an on-chip VCO. \nThe PLL blocks can be used either with the on-chip VCO to \ncreate a complete phase-locked loop, or with an external VCO or VCXO. The PLL requires an external loop filter, which \nusually consists of a small number  of capacitors and resistors. \nThe configuration and components of the loop filter help to \nestablish the loop bandwidth and stability of the operating PLL.  \nThe AD9517 PLL is useful for generating clock frequencies \nfrom a supplied reference frequency. This includes conversion of \nreference frequencies to much higher frequencies for subsequent division and distribution. In addition, the PLL can be exploited to \nclean up jitter and phase noise on a noisy reference. The exact \nchoices of PLL parameters and loop  dynamics are very application \nspecific. The flexibility and depth of the AD9517 PLL allow the \npart to be tailored to function in many different applications and signal environments. \nConfiguration of the PLL \nThe AD9517 allows flexible configuration of the PLL, \naccommodating various refe rence frequencies, PFD \ncomparison frequencies, VCO frequencies, internal or external VCO/VCXO, and loop dynamics. This is accomplished by the various settings that include the R divider, the N divider, the \nPFD polarity (only applicable to external VCO/VCXO), the \nantibacklash pulse width, the charge pump current, the selection of internal VCO or external VCO/VCXO, and the loop bandwidth.  These are managed through prog rammable register settings \n(see Table 52 and Table 54) and by the design of the external loop filter. Successful PLL operation and satisfactory PLL loop performance are highly dependent upon proper configuration \nof the PLL settings. The design of the external loop filter is \ncrucial to the proper operat ion of the PLL. A thorough \nknowledge of PLL theory and design is helpful. \nADIsimCLK ™ (V1.2 or later) is a free program that can help \nwith the design and exploration of  the capabilities and features \nof the AD9517, including the design of th e PLL loop filter. It is \navailable at www.analog.com/clocks. \nPhase Frequency Detector (PFD) \nThe PFD takes inputs from the R counter and N counter and \nproduces an output proportion al to the phase and frequency \ndifference between them. The PFD includes a programmable \ndelay element that controls the width of the antibacklash pulse. \nThis pulse ensures that there is no  dead zone in the PFD transfer \nfunction and minimizes phase noise and reference spurs. The antibacklash pulse width is set by Register 0x017[1:0]. \nAn important limit to keep in mind is the maximum frequency \nallowed into the PFD, which in turn determines the correct antibacklash pulse setting. The antibacklash pulse setting is \nspecified in the phase/frequency detector parameter of Table 2. \nAD9517-0 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 34 of 80 Charge Pump (CP) \nThe charge pump is controlled by the PFD. The PFD monitors \nthe phase and frequency relationship between its two inputs, \nand tells the CP to pump up or pump down to charge or \ndischarge the integrating node (part of the loop filter). The integrated and filtered CP current  is transformed into a voltage \nthat drives the tuning node of the internal VCO through the LF pin (or the tuning pin of an external VCO) to move the VCO \nfrequency up or down. The CP can be set (Register 0x010[6:4]) \nfor high impedance (allows hold over operation), for normal \noperation (attempts to lock the PLL loop), for pump up, or for \npump down (test modes). The CP current is programmable in \neight steps from (nominally) 600 μA to 4.8 mA. The exact value \nof the CP current LSB is set by the CPRSET resistor, which is \nnominally 5.1 kΩ. If the value of  the resistor connected to the \nCP_RSET pin is doubled, the resulting charge pump current range becomes 300 μA to 2.4 mA. \nOn-Chip VCO \nThe AD9517 includes an on-chip VCO covering the frequency \nrange shown in Table 2. The cali bration procedure ensures that \nthe VCO operating voltage is centered for the desired VCO frequency. The VCO must be calibrated when the VCO loop is first set up, as well as any time the nominal VCO frequency changes. However, once the VCO is calibrated, the VCO has \nsufficient operating range to stay  locked over temperature and \nvoltage extremes without needing additional calibration. See \nthe VCO Calibration section for additional information. \nThe on-chip VCO is powered by an on-chip, low dropout \n(LDO), linear voltage regulator. The LDO provides some isolation of the VCO from variations in the power supply voltage level. The BYPASS pin should be connected to ground \nby a 220 nF capacitor to ensure stability. This LDO employs the \nsame technology used in the an yCAP® line of regulators from \nAnalog Devices, Inc., making it  insensitive to the type of \ncapacitor used. Driving an exte rnal load from the BYPASS pin \nis not supported.  \nNote that the reference input signal must be present and the \nVCO divider must not be static during VCO calibration. \nPLL External Loop Filter \nWhen using the internal VCO, the external loop filter should \nbe referenced to the BYPASS pin for optimal noise and spurious performance. An example of an external loop filter for a PLL that uses the internal VCO is shown in Figure 47. The \nthird-order design shown in Figure 47 usually offers best \nperformance. A loop filter must be calculated for each desired PLL configuration. The values of the components depend upon the VCO frequency, the K\nVCO, the PFD frequency, the CP current, the \ndesired loop bandwidth, and the desired phase margin. The loop filter affects the phase noise, loop settling time, and loop stability. \nA basic knowledge of PLL theory is helpful for understanding \nloop filter design. ADIsimCLK can help with the calculation of a loop filter according to the application requirements. When using an external VCO, the external loop filter should be referenced to ground. See Figure 48 for an example of an external \nloop filter for a PLL using an external VCO. \nLFVCO\nCHARGE\nPUMPCP\nBYPASSC1 C2 C3R131pF\nR2\nCBP = 220nFAD9517-0\n06424-065 \nFigure 47.

Example of External Loop Filter for a PLL Using an External VCO \nPLL Reference Inputs \nThe AD9517 features a flexible PLL reference input circuit that \nallows either a fully differential input or two separate single-ended \ninputs. The input frequency range for the reference inputs is specified in Table 2. Both the differential and the single-ended inputs are self-biased, allowing for easy ac coupling of input signals. \nThe differential input and the single-ended inputs share the two \npins, REFIN and REFIN\n (REF1 and REF2, respectively). The \ndesired reference input type is selected and controlled by \nRegister 0x01C (see Table 52 and Table 54). \nWhen the differential reference input is selected, the self-bias \nlevel of the two sides is offset slightly (~100 mV, see Table 2) to \nprevent chattering of the input buffer when the reference is slow or missing. This increases the voltage swing that is required of the driver and overcomes the offset. The differential \nreference input can be driven by either ac-coupled LVDS or ac-coupled LVPECL signals. \nThe single-ended inputs can be driven by either a dc-coupled \nCMOS level signal or an ac-coupled sine wave or square wave. \nEach single-ended input can be independently powered down \nwhen not needed to increase isolation and reduce power. Either a differential or a single-ended reference must be specifically enabled. All PLL reference in puts are off by default. \nThe differential reference input is powered down whenever the PLL is powered down, or when the differential reference input is not selected. The single-ended buffers power down when the \nPLL is powered down, and when their individual power down \nData Sheet AD9517-0\n \nRev. F | Page 35 of 80 registers are set. When the diffe rential mode is selected, the \nsingle-ended inputs are powered down. \nIn differential mode, the reference input pins are internally self-\nbiased so that they can be ac-coupl ed via capacitors. It is possible to \ndc couple to these inputs. If the differential REFIN is driven by a single-ended signal, the unused side ( REFIN\n) should be \ndecoupled via a suitable capacitor to a quiet ground.

REFIN Eq uivalent Circuit \nReference Switchover \nThe AD9517 supports dual single-ended CMOS inputs, as well \nas a single differential reference input. In the dual single-ended \nreference mode, the AD9517 supports automatic and manual \nPLL reference clock switching between REF1 (on Pin REFIN) \nand REF2 (on Pin REFIN ). This feature supports networking \nand other applications that requ ire smooth switching of redundant \nreferences. When used in conjunction with the automatic \nholdover function, the AD9517 can achieve a worst-case \nreference input switchover with an output frequency disturbance \nas low as 10 ppm. \nWhen using reference switchover, the single-ended reference \ninputs should be dc-coupled CMOS levels and never be allowed \nto go to high impedance. If these inputs are allowed to go to high \nimpedance, noise may cause the buffer to chatter, causing a false detection of the presence of a reference. \nReference switchover can be performed manually or auto-\nmatically. Manual switchover is performed either through \nRegister 0x01C or by using the REF_SEL pin. Manual switchover requires the presence of a clock on the reference input that is being \nswitched to, or that the deglitching feature be disabled (Register \n0x01C[7]). The reference switching logic fails if this condition is not met, and the PLL does not reacquire. Automatic revertive switchover relies on the REFMON pin to indicate when REF1 disappears. By programming Register 0x01B = \n0xF7 and Register 0x01C = 0x26, the REFMON pin is programmed to be high when REF1 is invalid, which commands \nthe switch to REF2. When REF1 is valid again, the REFMON \npin goes low, and the part again lock s to REF1. It is also possible to \nuse the STATUS pin for this function, and REF2 can be used as the preferred reference.  \nA switchover deglitch feature ensures that the PLL does not \nreceive rising edges that are far out of alignment with the newly selected reference. \nAutomatic nonrevertive switching is not supported. \nReference Divider R  \nThe reference inputs are routed to the reference divider, R.  \nR (a 14-bit counter) can be set to any value from 0 to 16383 by writing to Register 0x011 and Register 0x012. (Both R = 0 and R = 1 give divide-by-1.) The output of the R divider goes to one of the PFD inputs to be compared to the VCO frequency \ndivided by the N divider. The frequency applied to the PFD \nmust not exceed the maximum allowable frequency, which \ndepends on the antibacklash pulse setting (see Table 2).  \nThe R counter has its own reset.  R counter can be reset using \nthe shared reset bit of the R, A, and B counters. It can also be \nreset by a SYNC\n operation. \nVCXO/VCO Feedback Divider N—P, A, B, R \nThe N divider is a combination of a prescaler (P) and two \ncounters, A and B. The total divider value is  \nN = (P × B) + A  \nwhere the value of P can be 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. \nPrescaler \nThe prescaler of the AD9517 allows for two modes of operation: \na fixed divide (FD) mode of 1, 2, or 3, and dual modulus (DM) mode where the prescaler divides by P and (P + 1) {2 and 3, \n4 and 5, 8 and 9, 16 and 17, or 32 and 33}. The prescaler modes \nof operation are given in Table 54, Register 0x016[2:0]. Not all \nmodes are available at all frequencies (see Table 2).  \nWhen operating the AD9517 in dual modulus mode (P//P + 1), the equation used to relate input reference frequency to VCO output frequency is \nf\nVCO = (fREF/R) × (P  × B + A) = f REF × N /R \nHowever, when operating the prescaler in an FD mode of 1, 2, or 3, the A counter is not used (A = 0) and the equation \nsimplifies to \nf\nVCO = (fREF/R) × (P  × B) = f REF × N/R \nWhen A = 0, the divide is a fixed di vide of P = 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32, \nin which case the previous equation also applies. \nAD9517-0 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 36 of 80 By using combinations of the DM and FD modes, the AD9517 \ncan achieve values of N all the way down to N = 1 and up to \nN = 26,2175. Table 28 shows how a 10 MHz reference input can be locked to any integer multiple of N. \nNote that the same value of N can be derived in different ways, \nas illustrated by the case of N = 12. The user can choose a fixed \ndivide mode of P = 2 with B = 6; use the dual modulus mode of \n2/3 with A = 0, B = 6; or use the dual modulus mode of 4/5 with A = 0, B = 3. \nThe maximum frequency into the prescaler in 2/3 dual-modulus \nmode is limited to 200 MHz. There are only two cases where this \nfrequency limitation limits the flexibility of that N divider: N = 7 and N = 11. In these two cases, the maximum frequency into \nthe prescaler is 300 MHz and is ac hieved by using the P = 1 FD \nmode. In all other cases, the user can achieve the desired N \ndivider value by using the other prescaler modes. \nA and B Counters \nThe B counter must be ≥3 or bypassed, and, unlike the R counter, A = 0 is actually zero. \nWhen the prescaler is in dual-modulus mode, the A counter \nmust be less than the B counter. \nThe maximum input frequency to the A/B counter is reflected \nin the maximum prescaler output frequency (~300 MHz) that is \nspecified in Table 2. This is the prescaler input frequency (VCO or CLK) divided by P. For example, a dual modulus mode of P = 8/9 \nis not allowed if the VCO frequency is greater than 2400 MHz because the frequency going to the A/B counter is too high.  \nWhen the AD9517 B counter is bypassed (B = 1), the A counter \nshould be set to 0, and the overa ll resulting divide is equal to the \nprescaler setting, P. The possible divide ratios in this mode are \n1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, and 32. This mode is useful only when an external \nVCO/VCXO is used because the frequency range of the internal VCO requires an overall feedback divider greater than 32. \nAlthough manual reset is not normally required, the A/B counters \nhave their own reset bit. Alternatively, the A and B counters can be reset using the shared reset bit of the R, A, and B counters. Note that these reset bits are not self-clearing.  \nR, A, and B Counters— SYNC  Pin Reset \nThe R, A, and B counters can also  be reset simultaneously through \nthe SYNC  pin. This function is controlled by Register 0x019[7:6] \n(see Table 54). The SYNC  pin reset is disabled by default. \nR and N Divider Delays \nBoth the R and N dividers feature a programmable delay cell. These delays can be enabled to allow adjustment of the phase \nrelationship between the PLL re ference clock and the VCO or \nCLK. Each delay is controlled by three bits. The total delay \nrange is about 1 ns. See Register 0x019 in Table 54. \n \nTable 28.

F | Page 37 of 80 DIGITAL LOCK DETECT (DLD) \nBy selecting the proper output through the mux on each pin, \nthe DLD function can be made available at the LD, STATUS, and REFMON pins. The DLD circuit indicates a lock when the time difference of the rising edges at the PFD inputs is less than \na specified value (the lock threshold). The loss of a lock is \nindicated when the time difference exceeds a specified value (the unlock threshold). Note that the unlock threshold is wider than the lock threshold, whic h allows some phase error in \nexcess of the lock window to occur without chattering on the lock indicator.  \nThe lock detect window timing depends on three settings: \nthe digital lock detect window  bit (Register 0x018[4]), the \nantibacklash pulse width setting (Register 0x017[1:0], see Table 2), and the lock detect counter (Reg ister 0x018[6:5]). A lock is not \nindicated until there is a programmable number of consecutive PFD cycles with a time difference that is less than the lock detect threshold. The lock detect circui t continues to indicate a lock \nuntil a time difference greater than the unlock threshold occurs on a single subsequent cycle. For the lock detect to work properly, \nthe period of the PFD frequency mu st be greater than the unlock \nthreshold. The number of consecutive PFD cycles required for lock is programmable (Register 0x018[6:5]). \nAnalog Lock Detect (ALD)  \nThe AD9517 provides an ALD function that can be selected for \nuse at the LD pin. There are two versions of ALD, as follows:  \n\uf0b7 N-channel open-drain lock detect. This signal requires \na pull-up resistor to the positive supply, V S. The output is \nnormally high with short, low-going pulses. Lock is indicated by the minimum duty cycle of the low-going pulses. \n\uf0b7 P-channel open-drain lock detect. This signal requires a pull-down resistor to GND. The output is normally low \nwith short, high-going pulses . Lock is indicated by the \nminimum duty cycle of the high-going pulses. \nThe analog lock detect function  requires an R-C filter to \nprovide a logic level indicating lock/unlock. \nAD9517-0\nALDLD R1\nCVOUTR2VS = 3.3 V\n06424-067 \nFigure 50. Example of Analog Lock Detect Filter  \nUsing N-Channel Open-Drain Driver \nCurrent Source Digital Lock Detect (DLD) \nDuring the PLL locking sequence, it is normal for the DLD signal to toggle a number of times before remaining steady \nwhen the PLL is completely lo cked and stable. There may be \napplications where it is desirable to have DLD asserted only after the PLL is solidly locked. This is made possible by using  the current source lock detect function. This function is set when it is selected as the ou tput from the LD pin control \n(Register 0x01A[5:0]). \nThe current source lock detect provides a current of 110 μA \nwhen DLD is true, and it shorts to ground when DLD is false. If a capacitor is connected to the LD pin, it charges at a rate that \nis determined by the current source during the DLD true time \nbut is discharged nearly instantly when DLD is false. By monitoring the voltage at the LD pin (top of the capacitor), it is possible to get a logic high level only after the DLD has been true for a sufficiently long time. Any momentary DLD false \nresets the charging. By selecting a properly sized capacitor, it is \npossible to delay a lock detect in dication until the PLL is stably \nlocked and the lock detect does not chatter. \nThe voltage on the capacitor ca n be sensed by an external \ncomparator connected to the LD  pin. However, there is an \ninternal LD pin comparator that can be read at the REFMON \npin control (Register 0x01B[4:0] ) or the STATUS pin control \n(Register 0x017[7:2]) as an active high signal. It is also available as an active low signal (REFMON, Register 0x01B[4:0] and STATUS, Register 0x017[7:2]). The internal LD pin comparator trip point and hysteresis are listed in Table 16. \nAD9517-0\nLD\nREFMON\nORSTATUSCV\nOUT110µA\nDLD\nLD PIN\nCOMPARATOR\n06424-068 \nFigure 51.

Holdover is \nimplemented by putting the charge pump into a state of high \nimpedance. This is useful when the PLL reference clock is lost. \nHoldover mode allows the VC O to maintain a relatively \nconstant frequency even though there is no reference clock. Without this function, the charge pump is placed into a constant pump-up or pump-down state, resulting in a massive \nVCO frequency shift. Because the charge pump is placed in a \nhigh impedance state, any leakage that occurs at the charge pump output or the VCO tuning node causes a drift of the VCO frequency. This can be mitigated by using a loop filter that contains a large capacitive component because this drift is \nlimited by the current leakage induced slew rate (I\nLEAK/C) of the \nVCO control voltage. For most applications, the frequency accuracy is sufficient for 3 sec to 5 sec. \nBoth a manual holdover, using the SYNC\n pin, and an automatic \nholdover mode are provided. To use either function, the \nholdover function must be enabled (Register 0x01D[0] and \nRegister 0x01D[2]).  \nNote that the VCO cannot be calibrated with the holdover \nenabled because the holdover resets the N divider during calibration, which prevents proper calibration. Disable holdover before issuing a VCO calibration. \nManual Holdover Mode \nA manual holdover mode can be enabled that allows the user to place the charge pump into a high impedance state when the \nSYNC\n pin is asserted low. This operation is edge sensitive, not \nlevel sensitive. The charge pump enters a high impedance state immediately. To take the charge pump out of a high impedance \nstate, take the SYNC\n pin high. The charge pump then leaves \nhigh impedance state synchronou sly with the next PFD rising \nedge from the reference clock. This prevents extraneous charge \npump events from occurring during the time between SYNC  \ngoing high and the next PFD event. This also means that the \ncharge pump stays in a high impedance state as long as there is no reference clock present. \nThe B-counter (in the N divider) is reset synchronously with \nthe charge pump leaving the high impedance state on the reference path PFD event. This helps align the edges out of the R and N dividers for faster settling of the PLL. Because the \nprescaler is not reset, this feat ure works best when the B and R \nnumbers are close because this results in a smaller phase \ndifference for the loop to settle out. \nWhen using this mode, set the channel dividers to ignore the \nSYNC\n pin (at least after an initial SYNC  event). If the dividers \nare not set to ignore the SYNC  pin, the distribution outputs turn \noff each time SYNC  is taken low to put the part into holdover.  \n Automatic/Internal Holdover Mode \nWhen enabled, this function automatically puts the charge pump \ninto a high impedance state when the loop loses lock. The \nassumption is that the only reason the loop loses lock is due to \nthe PLL losing the reference clock; therefore, the holdover function \nputs the charge pump into a high impedance state to maintain the VCO frequency as close as possible to the original frequency before the reference clock disappears. See Figure 53 for a flowchart \nof the automatic/internal holdover function operation. \nNO\nNO\nNO\nNOYES\nYESYES\nYESYESPLL ENABLED\nDLD == LOW\nWAS\nLD PIN == HIGH\nWHEN DLD WENT\nLOW?\nHIGH IMPEDANCE\nCHARGE PUMP\n  REFERENCE\nEDGE AT PFD?\nRELEASE\nCHARGE PUMP\nHIGH IMPEDANCE\nDLD == HIGHLOOP OUT OF LOCK.

Flowchart of Automatic/Internal Holdover Mode \nData Sheet AD9517-0\n \nRev. F | Page 39 of 80 The holdover function senses the logic level of the LD pin as a \ncondition to enter holdover. The signal at LD can be from the \nDLD, ALD, or current source LD mode. It is possible to disable the LD comparator (Register 0x01D[3]), which causes the holdover \nfunction to always sense LD as high. If DLD is used, it is possible \nfor the DLD signal to chatter some while the PLL is reacquiring lock. The holdover function may retrigger, thereby preventing \nthe holdover mode from ever terminating. Use of the current source lock detect mode is recommended to avoid this situation \n(see the Current Source Digital Lock Detect section).  \nOnce in holdover mode, the charge pump stays in a high \nimpedance state as long as there is no reference clock present. \nAs in the external holdover mode, the B counter (in the N divider) is reset synchronously with the charge pump leaving \nthe high impedance state on the reference path PFD event. This helps align the edges out of the R and N dividers for faster settling of the PLL and to reduce frequency errors during settling. Because the prescaler is not reset, this feature works \nbest when the B and R numbers are close because this results in \na smaller phase difference for the loop to settle out. \nAfter leaving holdover, the loop then reacquires lock and the \nLD pin must charge (if Register 0x01D[3] = 1) before it can re-enter holdover (CP high impedance).  \nThe holdover function always responds to the state of the \ncurrently selected reference (Reg ister 0x01C). If the loop loses \nlock during a reference switchover (see the Reference Switchover \nsection), holdover is triggered briefly until the next reference \nclock edge at the PFD. \nThe following registers affect th e internal/automatic holdover \nfunction: \n\uf0b7 Register 0x018[6:5], lock detect  counter. These bits change \nthe number of consecutive PFD cycles with edges inside the \nlock detect window that are required for the DLD indicator to indicate lock. This impacts the time required before the LD pin can begin to charge as well as the delay from the end of a holdover event until the holdover function can be \nreengaged. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x018[3], disable digita l lock detect. This bit must \nbe set to 0b to enable the DLD circuit. Internal/automatic \nholdover does not operate correctly without the DLD function enabled. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01A[5:0], lock detect pin output select. Set these bits to 000100b for the current source lock detect mode if using the LD pin comparator. Load the LD pin with a capacitor of an appropriate value. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01D[3], enable LD pin comparator. 1 = enable, 0 = disable. When disabled, the holdover function always \nsenses the LD pin as high. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01D[1], enable external holdover control.  \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01D[0] and Regi ster 0x01D[2], holdover \nfunction enable. If holdover is disabled, both external \nand internal/automatic holdover are disabled. For example, to use automatic holdover with the following: \n\uf0b7 Automatic reference switchover, prefer REF1 \n\uf0b7 Digital lock detect: five PF D cycles, high range window \n\uf0b7 Automatic holdover using the LD pin comparator \nSet the following registers (in addition to the normal PLL registers): \n\uf0b7 Register 0x018[6:5] = 00b; lock detect counter = five cycles. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x018[4] = 0b; lock de tect window = high range. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x018[3] = 0b; DLD normal operation. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01A[5:0] = 000100b; current source lock detect \nmode. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01B[7:0] = 0xF7; set REFMON pin to status of \nREF1 (active low). \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01C[2:1] = 11b; enable REF1 and REF2 input \nbuffers. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01D[3] = 1b; enable LD pin comparator. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01D[2]=1b; enable  the holdover function. \n\uf0b7 R\negister 0x01D[1] = 0b; use internal/automatic holdover \nmode. \n\uf0b7 Register 0x01D[0] = 1b; enable the holdover function.

A diagram showing their location in the PLL is shown in Figure 54. The VCO status frequency monitor is also capable of monitoring the CLK input if the CLK input is \nselected as the input to the N divider. \nThe PLL reference frequency monitors have two threshold \nfrequencies: normal and extended (see Table 16).

Reference and VCO Status Monitors \nVCO Calibration \nThe AD9517 on-chip VCO must be calibrated to ensure proper \noperation over process and temperature. VCO calibration centers \nthe dc voltage at the internal VC O input (at the LF pin) for the \nselected configuration; this is norm ally required only during initial \nconfiguration and any time the PLL settings change. VCO calibra-\ntion is controlled by a calibration controller driven by the R divider \noutput. The calibration requires that the input reference clock be \npresent at the REFIN pins, and that the PLL be set up properly \nto lock the PLL loop. During the first initialization after a power-up or a reset of the AD9517, a VCO calibration sequence is initiated by setting Register 0x018[0] = 1b. This can be done during initial setup, before executing an update registers (Register 0x232[0] = 1b). Subsequent to initial setup, a VCO calibration \nsequence is initiated by resetting Register 0x018[0] = 0b, executing \nan update registers operation, setting Register 0x018[0] = 1b, and executing another update register s operation. A readback bit, \nBit 6 in Register 0x1F, indica tes when a VCO calibration is \nfinished by returning a logic true (that is, 1b).  \nThe sequence of operations for the VCO calibration is as follows: 1. Program the PLL registers to the proper values for the PLL \nloop. Note that that automatic holdover mode must be \ndisabled, and the VCO divider must not be set to “Static.” \n2. Ensure that the input reference signal is present. \n3. For the initial setting of the registers after a power-up or reset, \ninitiate VCO calibration by se tting Register 0x018[0] = 1b. \nSubsequently, whenever a calibration is desired, set Register 0x018[0] = 0b, update  registers; and then set \nRegister 0x018[0] = 1b, update registers.  \n4. A sync operation is initiated internally, causing the outputs to go to a static state determined by normal sync function operation.  \n5. The VCO calibrates to the desired setting for the requested \nVCO frequency. \n6. Internally, the SYNC\n signal is released, allowing outputs to \ncontinue clocking. 7. The PLL loop is closed. \n8. The PLL locks. \nA sync is executed during the VCO calibration; therefore, the \noutputs of the AD9517 are held static during the calibration, \nwhich prevents unwanted frequencies from being produced. However, at the end of a VCO calibration, the outputs may \nresume clocking before the PLL loop is completely settled. \nThe VCO calibration clock divider is set as shown in Table 54 \n(Register 0x018[2:1]). \nThe calibration divider divides the PFD frequency (reference \nfrequency divided by R) down to the calibration clock. The calibration occurs at the PFD frequency divided by the calibration divider setting. Lower VCO calibration clock \nfrequencies result in longer times for a calibration to be \ncompleted. \nThe VCO calibration clock frequency is given by \nf\nCAL_CLOCK  = fREFIN/(R × cal_div ) \nwhere: \nfREFIN is the frequency of the REFIN signal. \nR is the value of the R divider. \ncal_div  is the division set for the VCO calibration divider \n(Register 0x018[2:1]). \nThe VCO calibration takes 440 0 calibration clock cycles. \nTherefore, the VCO calibration time in PLL reference clock \ncycles is given by \nTime to Calibrate VCO  =  \n4400 × R × cal_div PLL Reference Clock Cycles \nTable 29.

This allows for \nflexibility in deciding what order to program registers and when to initiate a calibration, instead of having it happen every time certain PLL registers have their values change. For \nexample, this allows for the VC O frequency to be changed by \nsmall amounts without having an automatic calibration occur \neach time; this should be done with caution and only when the user knows that the VCO control voltage is not going to exceed \nthe nominal best performance limits. For example, a few 100 \nkHz steps are fine, but a few MHz might not be. In addition, \nbecause the calibration procedure results in rapid changes in the VCO frequency, the distribution section is automatically placed in SYNC until the calibration is finished. Therefore, this temporary loss of outputs must be expected. \nA VCO calibration should be initiated under the following \nconditions:  \n\uf0b7 After changing any of the PLL R, P, B, and A divider \nsettings, or after a change in the PLL reference clock \nfrequency. This, in effect, me ans any time a PLL register \nor reference clock is changed such that a different VCO \nfrequency results. \n\uf0b7 Whenever system calibration is desired. The VCO is designed to operate properly over extremes of temperatures even when it is first calibrated at the opposite extreme. However, a \nVCO calibration can be initiated at any time, if desired.  \nCLOCK DISTRIBUTION \nA clock channel consists of a pair (or double pair, in the case of \nCMOS) of outputs that share a common divider. A clock output consists of the drivers that connect to the output pins. The clock outputs have either LVPECL or LVDS/CMOS signal \nlevels at the pins. \nThe AD9517 has four clock channels: two channels are \nLVPECL (four outputs); two channels are LVDS/CMOS (up to \nfour LVDS outputs or up to eight CMOS outputs).  \nEach channel has its own programmable divider that divides \nthe clock frequency that is applied to its input. The LVPECL channel dividers can divide by any integer from 2 to 32, or the divider can be bypassed to achieve a divide by one. Each LVDS/CMOS channel divider contains two of these divider \nblocks in a cascaded configuration. The total division of the \nchannel is the product of the divide value of the cascaded dividers. This allows divide values of (1 to 32) × (1 to 32), or up to 1024 (note that this is not all values from 1 to 1024 but only the set of numbers that are the product of the two dividers). \nIf the user wishes to use the channel dividers, the VCO divider \nmust be used after the on-chip VCO. This is because the internal \nVCO frequency is above the maximum channel divider input \nfrequency (1600 MHz). The VCO di vider can be set to divide \nby 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. External clock signals connected to the CLK input also require the VCO divider if the frequency of the signal is greater than 1600 MHz. The channel dividers allow for a selection of various duty cycles, depending on the currently set division. That is, for any specific division, D, the output of the divider can be set to high for  \nN + 1 input clock cycles and low for M + 1 input clock cycles \n(where D = N + M + 2). For example, a divide-by-5 can be high for one divider input cycle and low for four cycles, or a divide-by-5 can be high for three divi der input cycles and low for two \ncycles. Other combinations are also possible. \nThe channel dividers include a duty-cycle correction function \nthat can be disabled. In contrast to the selectable duty cycle  \njust described, this function can correct a non-50% duty cycle \ncaused by an odd division. However, this requires that the division be set by M = N + 1. \nIn addition, the channel dividers allow a coarse phase offset or \ndelay to be set. Depending on the division selected, the output can be delayed by up to 31 input clock cycles. The divider outputs can also be set to start high or start low.  \nInternal VCO or External CLK as Clock Source  \nThe clock distribution of the AD9517 has two clock input \nsources: an internal VCO or an external clock connected to the \nCLK/ CLK  pins. Either the internal VCO or CLK must be \nchosen as the source of the clock signal to distribute. When the \ninternal VCO is selected as the source, the VCO divider must be used. When CLK is selected as the source, it is not necessary \nto use the VCO divider if the CLK frequency is less than the \nmaximum channel divider input frequency (1600 MHz); otherwise, the VCO divider must be used to reduce the frequency to one acceptable by the channel dividers. Table 30 shows how the VCO, CLK, and VCO divider are selected. Register 0x1E1[1:0] selects th e channel divider source and \ndetermines whether the VCO divider is used. It is not possible to select the VCO without using the VCO divider. \nTable 30.

This configuration \ncan pass frequencies up to the maximum frequency of the VCO \ndirectly to the LVPECL outputs. The LVPECL outputs may not be able to provide a full voltage swing at the highest frequencies. \nAD9517-0 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 42 of 80 To connect the LVPECL outputs directly to the internal VCO \nor CLK, the VCO divider must be selected as the source to the \ndistribution section, even if no channel uses it.  \nEither the internal VCO or the CLK can be selected as the \nsource for the direct -to-output routing. \nTable 31. Settings for Routing VCO Divider Input Directly to LVPECL Outputs \nRegister Setting Selection \n0x1E1[1:0] = 00b CLK is the source; VCO divider selected \n0x1E1[1:0] = 10b VCO is the source; VCO divider selected \n0x192[1] = 1b Direct to OUT0 and OUT1 outputs \n0x198[1] = 1b Direct to OUT2 and OUT3 outputs \nClock Frequency Division \nThe total frequency division is a combination of the VCO divider (when used) and the channel divider. When the VCO divider is used, the total division from the VCO or CLK to the \noutput is the product of the VCO divider (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) and \nthe division of the channel divider. Table 32 and Table 33 indicate how the frequency division for a channel is set. For the LVPECL outputs, there is only one divider per channel. For the LVDS/ CMOS outputs, there are two dividers (X.1, X.2) cascaded per channel. \nTable 32.

This divider provides for division by 2 to 32. Division by 1 is accomplished by bypassing the divider. The dividers also provide for a \nprogrammable duty cycle, with optional duty-cycle correction \nwhen the divide ratio is odd.  A phase offset or delay in \nincrements of the input clock cy cle is selectable. The channel \ndividers operate with a signal at their inputs up to 1600 MHz. \nThe features and settings of the dividers are selected by \nprogramming the appropriate setup  \nand control registers (see Table 52 through Table 62). \nVCO Divider \nThe VCO divider provides frequency division between the internal VCO or the external CLK input and the clock distribution channel dividers. The VCO divider can be set \nto divide by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (see Table 60, Register 0x1E0[2:0]). \nChannel Dividers—LVPECL Outputs \nEach pair of LVPECL outputs is  driven by a channel divider. \nThere are two channel dividers (0, 1) driving four LVPECL \noutputs (OUT0 to OUT3). Table 34 gives the register locations \nused for setting the division and other functions of these \ndividers. The division is set by the values of M and N. The divider can be bypassed (equivalent to divide-by-1, divider circuit is powered down) by setting the bypass bit. The duty-cycle correction can be enabled or disabled according to the setting of the DCCOFF bits. \nTable 34.

This allows \neach channel divider to divide by any integer from 2 to 32. \n \nData Sheet AD9517-0\n \nRev. F | Page 43 of 80 Duty Cycle and Duty-Cyc le Correction (0, 1) \nThe duty cycle of the clock signal at the output of a channel is a \nresult of some or all of  the following conditions: \n\uf0b7 What are the M and N values for the channel? \n\uf0b7 Is the DCC enabled? \n\uf0b7 Is the VCO divider used? \n\uf0b7 What is the CLK input duty cycle? (The internal VCO has \na 50% duty cycle.) \nThe DCC function is enabled by default for each channel divider. However, the DCC function can be disabled individually for each channel divider by setting the DCCOFF bit for that channel. \nCertain M and N values for a channel divider result in a non-50% duty cycle. A non-50% duty cycle can also result with an even \ndivision, if M ≠ N. The duty-cycle correction function \nautomatically corrects non-50% duty cycles at the channel divider output to 50% duty cycle. Duty-cycle correction requires the following channel divider conditions:  \n\uf0b7 An even division must be set as M = N. \n\uf0b7 An odd division must be set as M = N + 1. \nWhen not bypassed or corrected by the DCC function, the duty \ncycle of each channel divider output is the numerical value of \n(N + 1)/(N + M + 2), expressed as a percentage (%). \nThe duty cycle at the output of the channel divider for various \nconfigurations is shown in Table 35 to Table 37.  \nTable 35.

F | Page 44 of 80 Phase Offset or Coarse Time Delay (0, 1) \nEach channel divider allows for a phase offset, or a coarse time \ndelay, to be programmed by setting register bits (see Table 38). \nThese settings determine the number of cycles (successive rising \nedges) of the channel divider input frequency by which to offset, or delay, the rising edge of the output of the divider. This delay is with respect to a nondelayed output (that is, with a phase offset of zero). The amount of the delay is set by five bits loaded into \nthe phase offset (PO) register plus the start high (SH) bit for each \nchannel divider. When the start high bit is set, the delay is also affected by the number of low cycles (M) that are programmed for the divider. \nThe sync function must be used to make phase offsets effective \n(see the Synchronizing the Outputs—Sync Function section).  \nTable 38.

Effect of Coarse Phase Offset (or Delay) Channel Dividers—LVDS/CMOS Outputs \nChannel Divider 2 and Channel Divider 3 each drive a pair of \nLVDS outputs, giving a total of four LVDS outputs (OUT4 to \nOUT7). Alternatively, each of these LVDS differential outputs \ncan be configured individually as a pair (A and B) of CMOS \nsingle-ended outputs, providing for up to eight CMOS outputs. By default, the B output of each pair is off but can be turned on as desired.  \nChannel Divider 2 and Channel Divider 3 each consist of two \ncascaded, 2 to 32, frequency dividers. The channel frequency \ndivision is D\nX.1 × D X.2 or up to 1024. Divide-by-1 is achieved by \nbypassing one or both of these dividers. Both of the dividers \nalso have DCC enabled by default, but this function can be disabled, if desired, by setting the DCCOFF bit of the channel. A coarse phase offset or delay is also programmable (see the \nPhase Offset or Coarse Time De lay (Divider 2 and Divider 3) \nsection). The channel dividers operate up to 1600 MHz. The \nfeatures and settings of the divide rs are selected by programming \nthe appropriate setup and control registers (see Table 52 and Table \n53 through Table 62). \nTable 39.

However, not all integer value divisions from 1 to 1024 are obtainable; only the values  that are the product of the \nseparate divisions of the two dividers (D\nX.1 × D X.2) can be realized. \nIf only one divider is needed when using Divider 2 and Divider 3, use the first one (X.1) and bypass the second one (X.2).

If a delay longer than half of the clock period is attempted, the output stops clocking. \nThe delay function adds some jitter that is greater than that \nspecified for the nondelayed output. This means that the delay function should be used primar ily for clocking digital chips, \nsuch as FPGA, ASIC, DUC, and DDC. An output with this delay enabled may not be suitable for clocking data converters. The jitter is higher for long full scales because the delay block uses a ramp and trip points to create the variable delay. A slower ramp time produces more time jitter. \nSynchronizing the Outputs—Sync Function \nThe AD9517 clock outputs can be sync hronized to each other. \nOutputs can be individually excluded from synchronization. Synchronization consists of setting the nonexcluded outputs to a preset set of static conditions and subsequently releasing these outputs to continue clocking at the same instant with the preset \nconditions applied. This allows for the alignment of the edges \nof two or more outputs or for the spacing of edges according to the coarse phase offset settin gs for two or more outputs.  Synchronization of the outputs is executed in several ways, as follows: \n\uf0b7\n By forcing the SYNC  pin low and then releasing it (manual \nsync). \n\uf0b7 By setting and then resetting any one of the following three \nbits: the soft sync bit (Register 0x230[0]), the soft reset bit \n(Register 0x000[2] [mirrored]), and the power-down \ndistribution reference bit (Register 0x230[1]). \n\uf0b7 By executing synchronization of the outputs as part of the chip power-up sequence. \n\uf0b7\n By forcing the RESET  pin low and then releasing it (chip \nreset). \n\uf0b7 By forcing the PD pin low and then releasing it (chip power-\ndown). \n\uf0b7 Following completion of a VC O calibration. An internal \nSYNC signal is automatically asserted at the beginning of a VCO calibration and then released upon its completion.  \nThe most common way to execute the sync function is to use \nthe SYNC\n pin to do a manual synchronization of the outputs. \nThis requires a low-going signal on the SYNC  pin, which is \nheld low and then released when synchronization is desired. \nThe timing of the sync operation is shown in Figure 57 (using \nVCO divider) and Figure 58 (VCO divider not used). There is an uncertainty of up to one cycle of the clock at the input to the channel divider due to the asynchronous nature of the SYNC signal with respect to the clock edges inside the AD9517. The \ndelay from the SYNC\n rising edge to the beginning of synchronized \noutput clocking is between 14 and 15 cycles of clock at the \nchannel divider input, plus eith er one cycle of the VCO divider \ninput (see Figure 57), or one cycle of the channel divider input (see Figure 58), depending on wh ether the VCO divider is used. \nCycles are counted from the rising edge of the signal. \nAnother common way to execute the sync function is by setting \nand resetting the soft sync bit at Register 0x230[0] (see Table 53 \nthrough Table 62 for details). Both the setting and resetting of the soft sync bit require an update all registers operation \n(Register 0x232[0] = 1) to take effect. \n \nAD9517-0 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

SYNC Timing When VCO Di vider Is Not Used—CLK Input Only \n \nA sync operation brings all outputs that have not been excluded \n(by the nosync bit) to a preset condition before allowing the outputs to begin clocking in synchronicity. The preset condition takes into account the settings in each of the channel’s start high bit and its phase offset. These settings \ngovern both the static state of each output when the sync \noperation is happening and the state and relative phase of the outputs when they begin clocking again upon completion of the sync operation. Between outputs and after synchronization, this allows for the setting of phase offsets.  \nThe AD9517 outputs are in pairs, sharing a channel divider per \npair (two pairs of pairs, four outputs, in the case of CMOS). \nThe synchronization conditions a pply to both outputs of a pair. Each channel (a divider and its outputs) can be excluded from \nany sync operation by setting the nosync bit of the channel. Channels that are set to ignore SYNC (excluded channels) do not set their outputs static during a sync operation, and their outputs are not synchronized with those of the nonexcluded \nchannels. \nClock Outputs \nThe AD9517 offers three different output level choices: \nLVPECL, LVDS, and CMOS. OUT0 to OUT3 are LVPECL \ndifferential outputs; and OUT4 to OUT7 are LVDS/CMOS \noutputs. These outputs can be configured as either LVDS \ndifferential or as pairs of si ngle-ended CMOS outputs. \nData Sheet AD9517-0\n \nRev. F | Page 49 of 80 LVPECL Outputs—OUT0 to OUT3 \nThe LVPECL differential voltage (V OD) is selectable from ~400 mV \nto ~960 mV (see Register 0x0F0[ 3:2] to Register 0x0F5[3:2]). \nThe LVPECL outputs have dedi cated pins for power supply \n(VS_LVPECL), allowing a separate power supply to be used. \nVS_LVPECL  can be from 2.5 V to 3.3 V. \nThe LVPECL output polarity can be set as noninverting or inverting, which allows for th e adjustment of the relative \npolarity of outputs within an application without requiring a board layout change. Each LV PECL output can be powered \ndown or powered up as needed. Because of the architecture of the LVPECL output stages, there is the possibility of electrical overstress and breakdown under certain power-down conditions. For this reason, the LVPECL outp uts have several power-down \nmodes. This includes a safe power-down mode that continues \nto protect the output devices while powered down, although it \nconsumes somewhat more power than a total power-down. If the LVPECL output pins are termin ated, it is best to select the \nsafe power-down mode. If the pins are left floating (i.e., not connected), total power-down mode is fine. \nGND3.3V\nOUTOUT\n06424-033 \nFigure 59. LVPECL Output Simplified Equivalent Circuit \nLVDS/CMOS Outputs—OUT4 to OUT7 \nOUT4 to OUT7 can be configured as either an LVDS \ndifferential output or as a pair of CMOS single-ended outputs. \nThe LVDS outputs allow for selectable output current from ~1.75 mA to ~7 mA.  \nThe LVDS output polarity can be set as noninverting or \ninverting, which allows for th e adjustment of the relative \npolarity of outputs within an application without requiring a board layout change. Each LVDS output can be powered down \nif not needed to save power. \nOUT4 to OUT7 can also be CMOS outputs. Each LVDS output \ncan be configured to be two CMOS outputs. This provides for \nup to eight CMOS outputs: OUT4A, OUT4B, OUT5A, OUT5B, OUT6A, OUT6B, OUT7A, and OUT7B. When an output is configured as CMOS, CMOS Output A is automatically turned on. CMOS Output B can be turned on or off independently. The \nrelative polarity of the CMOS ou tputs can also be selected for \nany combination of inverting and noninverting (see Table 57, \nRegister 0x140[7:5], Register 0x 141[7:5], Register 0x142[7:5], \nand Register 0x143[7:5]).

CMOS Equivalent Output Circuit \nRESET MODES \nThe AD9517 has several ways to force the chip into a reset \ncondition that restores all registers to their default values and \nmakes these settings active. \nPower-On Reset—Start-Up Conditions When V S Is Applied \nA power-on reset (POR) is issued when the V S power supply is \nturned on. This initializes the chip to the power-on conditions \nthat are determined by the default register settings. These are \nindicated in the Default Value (Hex) column of Table 52. At \npower-on, the AD9517 also executes a sync operation, which \nbrings the outputs into phase alignment according to the default settings. \nAsynchronous Reset via the RESET  Pin \nAn asynchronous hard reset is executed by momentarily \npulling RESET  low. A reset restores the chip registers to the default \nsettings. \nSoft Reset via Register 0x00[2] \nA soft reset is executed by writing Register 0x000[2] and \nRegister 0x000[5] = 1b. This bit is not self-clearing; it must be cleared by writing Register 0x000[2] and Register 0x000[5] = 0b to reset it and complete the soft reset operation. A soft reset restores the default values to the internal registers. The soft reset bit does \nnot require an update register s command (Register 0x232) to \nbe issued. \nAD9517-0 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 50 of 80 POWER-DOWN MODES \nChip Power-Down via PD \nThe AD9517 can be put into a power-down condition by \npulling the PD pin low. Power-down turns off most of the \nfunctions and currents inside the AD9517. The chip remains \nin this power-down state until PD is brought back to logic high. \nWhen the AD9517 wakes up, it returns to the settings \nprogrammed into its registers prior to the power-down, unless \nthe registers are changed by new programming while the PD \npin is held low. \nThe PD power-down shuts down the currents on the chip, except \nthe bias current that is necessary  to maintain the LVPECL outputs \nin a safe shutdown mode. This is needed to protect the \nLVPECL output circuitry from da mage that could be caused by \ncertain termination and load configurations when tristated. \nBecause this is not a complete power-down, it can be called sleep mode. \nWhen the AD9517 is in a PD\n power-down, the chip is in the \nfollowing state: \n\uf0b7 The PLL is off (asynchronous power-down). \n\uf0b7 The VCO is off. \n\uf0b7 The CLK input buffer is off. \n\uf0b7 All dividers are off. \n\uf0b7 All LVDS/CMOS outputs are off. \n\uf0b7 All LVPECL outputs are in safe off mode. \n\uf0b7 The serial control port is acti ve, and the chip responds to \ncommands. \nIf the AD9517 clock outputs must be synchronized to each \nother, a SYNC is required upon exiting power-down (see the \nSynchronizing the Outputs—Sync Function section). A VCO \ncalibration is not required when exiting power-down. \nPLL Power-Down \nThe PLL section of the AD9517 can be selectively powered down. There are three PLL operating modes set by Register 0x010[1:0], \nas shown in Table 54.  In asynchronous power-down mo de, the device powers down \nas soon as the registers are updated. \nIn synchronous power-down mode, the PLL power-down is \ngated by the charge pump to prevent unwanted frequency jumps. The device goes into power-down on the occurrence of the next \ncharge pump event after the registers are updated. \nDistribution Power-Down \nThe distribution section can be powered down by writing Register 0x230[1] = 1b. This turns off the bias to the distribution section. If the LVPECL power-do wn mode is normal operation \n(00b), it is possible for a low impedance load on that LVPECL \noutput to draw significant curr ent during this power-down. If \nthe LVPECL power-down mode is set to 11b, the LVPECL output is not protected from reverse bias and may be damaged under certain termina tion conditions. \nIndividual Clock Output Power-Down \nAny of the clock distribution outputs can be powered down individually by writing to the a ppropriate registers. The register \nmap details the individual power-down settings for each output (see Table 52). The LVDS/CMOS outputs can be powered down, regardless of their output load configuration. \nThe LVPECL outputs have multiple power-down modes \n(see Table 56), which give some flexibility in dealing with the various output termination conditions. When the mode is set to \n10b, the LVPECL output is prot ected from reverse bias to  \n2 VBE + 1 V. If the mode is set to 11b, the LVPECL output is \nnot protected from reverse bias and can be damaged under certain termination conditions. This setting also affects the operation when the distribution block is powered down with \nRegister 0x230[1] = 1b (see the Distribution Power-Down \nsection). \nIndividual Circuit Block Power-Down \nOther AD9517 circuit blocks (such as CLK, REF1, and REF2) \ncan be powered down individually. This gives flexibility in configuring the part for power savings whenever certain chip \nfunctions are not needed. \n \n \nData Sheet AD9517-0\n \nRev. F | Page 51 of 80 SERIAL CONTROL PORT \nThe AD9517 serial control port is a flexible, synchronous, serial \ncommunications port that allows an easy interface with many \nindustry-standard microcontrol lers and microprocessors. The \nAD9517  serial control port is compatible with most synchronous \ntransfer formats, including both the Motorola SPI® and Intel® SSR® protocols. The serial control port allows read/write access \nto all registers that configure the AD9517. Single or multiple \nbyte transfers are supported, as well as MSB first or LSB first transfer formats. The AD9517 serial control port can be \nconfigured for a single bidirectional I/O pin (SDIO only) \nor for two unidirectional I/O pins (SDIO/SDO). By default, the AD9517 is in bidirectional mode, long instruction (long \ninstruction is the only instruction mode supported). \nSERIAL CONTROL PORT PIN DESCRIPTIONS \nSCLK (serial clock) is the serial shift clock. This pin is an input. SCLK is used to synchronize serial control port reads and writes. Write data bits are registered on the rising edge of this clock, and read data bits are regi stered on the falling edge. This \npin is internally pulled down by a 30 kΩ resistor to ground.  \nSDIO (serial data input/output) is  a dual-purpose pin that acts \nas either an input only (unidirectional mode) or as both an \ninput/output (bidirectional mode). The AD9517 defaults to the \nbidirectional I/O mode (R egister 0x000[0] = 0b). \nSDO\n (serial data out) is used only in the unidirectional I/O mode \n(Register 0x000[0] = 1b) as a se parate output pin for reading \nback data. \nCS (chip select bar) is an active low control that gates the read \nand write cycles. When CS is high, SDO and SDIO are in a high \nimpedance state. This pin is in ternally pulled up by a 30 kΩ \nresistor to V S.  \nAD9517-0\nSERIAL\nCONTROL\nPORTSCLK 16\nCS 17\nSDO 21\nSDIO 22\n06424-036 \nFigure 62. Serial Control Port \nGENERAL OPERATION OF SERIAL CONTROL PORT \nA write or a read operation to the AD9517 is initiated by pulling \nCS low.  \nCS stalled high is supported in modes where three or fewer bytes \nof data (plus instruction data) are transferred (see Table 47). \nIn these modes, CS can temporarily return  high on any byte \nboundary, allowing time for the system controller to process the next byte. CS\n can go high on byte boundaries only and can \ngo high during either part (instr uction or data) of the transfer.  During this period, the serial co ntrol port state machine enters \na wait state until all data is sent. If the system controller decides \nto abort the transfer before all of the data is sent, the state machine must be reset, either by completing the remaining transfers or \nby returning CS\n low for at least one complete SCLK cycle (but \nless than eight SCLK cycles). Raising CS on a nonbyte \nboundary terminates the serial transfer and flushes the buffer. \nIn the streaming mode (see Tabl e 47), any number of data bytes \ncan be transferred in a continuo us stream. The register address \nis automatically incremented or decremented (see the MSB/LSB \nFirst Transfers section). CS must be raised at the end of the last \nbyte to be transferred, thereby ending the stream mode. \nCommunication Cycle—Instruction Plus Data \nThere are two parts to a communication cycle with the AD9517. \nThe first part writes a 16-bit  instruction word into the AD9517 , \ncoincident with the first 16 SCLK rising edges. The instruction \nword provides the AD9517 serial control port with information \nregarding the data transfer, whic h is the second part of the \ncommunication cycle. The inst ruction word defines whether \nthe upcoming data transfer is a read or a write, the number of bytes in the data transfer, and the starting register address for the first byte of the data transfer.  \nWrite \nIf the instruction word is for a write operation, the second part \nis the transfer of data into the serial control port buffer of the \nAD9517. Data bits are registered on the rising edge of SCLK. \nThe length of the transfer (1, 2, 3 bytes or streaming mode) is \nindicated by two bits ([W1:W0]) in the instruction byte. When \nthe transfer is 1, 2, or 3 bytes, but not streaming, CS can be raised \nafter each sequence of eight bits to stall the bus (except after the last byte, where it ends the cycle). When the bus is stalled, the serial \ntransfer resumes when CS\n is lowered. Raising CS on a nonbyte \nboundary resets the serial control port. During a write, streaming \nmode does not skip over reserved or blank registers; therefore, \nthe user must know the bit pattern to write to the reserved registers to preserve proper operation of the part. Refer to the control register map (see Table 52) to determine if the default value for reserved registers is nonzero. It does not matter what \ndata is written to blank registers. \nBecause data is written into a serial control port buffer area, \nand not directly into the actual control registers of the AD9517 , \nan additional operation is needed to transfer the serial control \nport buffer contents to the actual control registers of the AD9517, thereby causing them to become active. The update registers operation consists of setting Register 0x232[0] = 1b \n(this bit is self-clearing). Any number of bytes of data can be changed before an update registers operation is executed. The update registers operation simult aneously actuates all register \nchanges that have been written to the buffer since any previous \nupdate. \nAD9517-0 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 52 of 80  \nRead \nIf the instruction word is for a read operation, the next N × 8 \nSCLK cycles clock out the data f rom the address specified in the \ninstruction word, where N is 1 to 3 as determined by [W1:W0].  If N = 4, the read operation is in streaming mode, continuing until CS\n is raised. Streaming mode does not skip over reserved \nor blank registers. The readback data is valid on the falling  edge of SCLK.  \nThe default mode of the AD9517 serial control port is the \nbidirectional mode. In bidirectional mode, both the sent data \nand the readback data appear on the SDIO pin. It is also possible to \nset the AD9517 to unidirectional mode via the SDO active bit, \nRegister 0x000[0] = 1b. In unid irectional mode , the readback \ndata appears on the SDO pin.  \nA readback request reads the data that is in the serial control \nport buffer area, or the data that is in the active registers (see \nFigure 63). Readback of the buffer or active registers is controlled by Register 0x004[0].  \nThe AD9517  supports only the long instruction mode; therefore, \nRegister 0x000[4:3] must be set to  11b. (This register uses mirrored \nbits.) Long instruction mode is the default at power-up or reset. The AD9517 uses Register Address 0x000 to Register \nAddress 0x232. \nSCLK\nSDIO\nSDO\nCSSERIAL\nCONTROLPORT\nBUFFER REGISTERSUPDATE\nREGISTERS\nWRITE REGISTER 0x232 = 0x01TO UDATE REGISTERS\nACTIVE REGISTERS\n06424-037 \nFigure 63. Relationship Between Seri al Control Port Buffer Registers and \nActive Registers of the AD9517  \nTHE INSTRUCTION WORD (16 BITS) \nThe MSB of the instruction word is R/ W, which indicates \nwhether the instruction is a read  or a write. The next two bits, \n[W1:W0], indicate the length of the transfer in bytes. The final \n13 bits are the address ([A12:A0]) at which to begin the read or \nwrite operation.  \nFor a write, the instruction word is followed by the number of \nbytes of data indicated by Bits[W1:W0] (see Table 47). \nTable 47. Byte Transfer Count \nW1 W0 Bytes to Transfer \n0 0 1 \n0 1 2 \n1 0 3 \n1 1 Streaming mode \n The 13 bits found in [A12:A0] select the address within the \nregister map that is written to  or read from during the data \ntransfer portion of the co mmunications cycle. Only \nBits[A9:A0] are needed to cover the range of the 0x232 registers \nused by the AD9517. Bits[A12:A10] must always be set to 0b. \nFor multibyte transfers, this address is the starting byte address. In MSB first mode, subsequent bytes decrement the address. \nMSB/LSB FIRST TRANSFERS \nThe AD9517 instruction word and byte data can be MSB first \nor LSB first. Any data written to Register 0x000 must be mirrored; \nthe upper four bits (Bits[7:4]) with  the lower four bits (Bits[3:0). \nThis makes it irrelevant whethe r LSB first or MSB first is in \neffect. As an example of this mirroring, see the default setting \nfor this register: 0x18, which mi rrors Bit 4 and Bit 3. This sets \nthe long instruction mode (which is the default and the only \nmode that is supported).  \nThe default for the AD9517 is MSB first.  When LSB first is set by Register  0x000[1] and Register 0x000[6], \nit takes effect immediately because it affects only the operation \nof the serial control port and does  not require that an update be \nexecuted.  \nWhen MSB first mode is active, the instruction and data bytes \nmust be written from MSB to LSB. Multibyte data transfers in \nMSB first format start with an instruction byte that includes the \nregister address of the most significant data byte. Subsequent data bytes must follow in order from the high address to the \nlow address. In MSB first mode, the serial control port internal address generator decrements for each data byte of the \nmultibyte transfer cycle.  \nWhen LSB first is active, the instruction and data bytes must be \nwritten from LSB to MSB. Multibyte data transfers in LSB first \nformat start with an instruction byte that includes the register \naddress of the least significant data byte followed by multiple \ndata bytes. The internal byte ad dress generator of the serial \ncontrol port increments for each byte of the multibyte \ntransfer cycle. \nThe AD9517 serial control port register address decrements \nfrom the register address just written toward 0x000 for multibyte \nI/O operations if the MSB first mode is active (default). If the LSB first mode is active, the register address of the serial control port increments from the address ju st written toward Address 0x232 \nfor multibyte I/O operations. \nStreaming mode always terminates  when it hits Address 0x232. \nNote that unused addresses are not skipped during multibyte \nI/O operations. \nTable 48.

F | Page 76 of 80 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nFREQUENCY PLANNING USING THE AD9517 \nThe AD9517 is a highly flexible PLL. When choosing the PLL \nsettings and version of the AD9517, keep in mind the following \nguidelines. \nThe AD9517 has the following four frequency dividers: the \nreference (or R) divider, the fe edback (or N) divider, the VCO \ndivider, and the channel divider. When trying to achieve a \nparticularly difficult frequency divide ratio requiring a large \namount of frequency division, so me of the frequency division \ncan be done by either the VCO divider or the channel divider, \nthus allowing a higher phase detector frequency and more flexibility in choosing the loop bandwidth. \nWithin the AD9517 family, lower VCO frequencies generally \nresult in slightly lower jitter. The difference in integrated jitter \n(from 12 kHz to 20 MHz offset) for the same output frequency \nis usually less than 150 fs over the entire VCO frequency range (1.45 GHz to 2.95 GHz) of the AD9517  family. If the desired \nfrequency plan can be achieved with a version of the AD9517 \nthat has a lower VCO frequency,  choosing the lower frequency \npart results in the lowest phase noise and the lowest jitter. \nHowever, choosing a higher VCO frequency may result in more \nflexibility in frequency planning. \nChoosing a nominal charge pump current in the middle of the \nallowable range as a starting point allows the designer to increase or decrease the charge pump current, and thus allows the designer to fine-tune the PLL loop bandwidth in either direction. \nADIsimCLK is a powerful PLL modeling tool that can be \ndownloaded from www.analog.com . It is a very accurate tool \nfor determining the optimal loop filter for a given application. \nUSING THE AD9517  OUTPUTS FOR ADC CLOCK \nAPPLICATIONS \nAny high speed ADC is extremely sensitive to the quality of its \nsampling clock. An ADC can be  thought of as a sampling \nmixer, and any noise, distortion, or timing jitter on the clock is combined with the desired sign al at the analog-to-digital \noutput. Clock integrity requirements scale with the analog input frequency and resolution , with higher analog input \nfrequency applications at ≥14-bit resolution being the most stringent. The theoretical SNR of an ADC is limited by the ADC resolution and the jitter on the sampling clock. Considering an ideal ADC of infinite resolution where the step size  and quantization error can be \nignored, the available SNR can be expressed approximately by \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\n\uf070\uf0b4 \uf03d\nJAt fSNR21log 20 (dB)  \nwhere:  \nfA is the highest analog frequency being digitized. \ntJ is the rms jitter on the sampling clock. \nFigure 70 shows the required sampling clock jitter as a function of the analog frequency and effective number of bits (ENOB). \nfA (MHz)SNR (dB)\nENOB\n10 1k 10030405060708090100110\n681012141618\ntJ = 100fS 200fS\n400fS\n1ps\n2ps\n10psSNR = 20log1\n2πfAtJ\n06424-044 \nFigure 70. SNR and ENOB vs. Analog Input Frequency \nSee the AN-756 Application Note , Sampled Systems and the Effects \nof Clock Phase Noise and Jitter ; and the AN-501 Application Note , \nAperture Uncertainty and ADC System Performance , at \nwww.analog.com . \nMany high performance ADCs fe ature differential clock inputs \nto simplify the task of providing the required low jitter clock on \na noisy PCB. (Distributing a single-ended clock on a noisy PCB \nmay result in coupled noise on the sample clock. Differential \ndistribution has inherent common-mode rejection that can \nprovide superior clock performa nce in a noisy environment.) The \nAD9517 features both LVPECL and LVDS outputs that provide \ndifferential clock outputs, which enable clock solutions that maximize converter SNR performance. The input requirements of the ADC (differential or single-ended, logic level, \ntermination) should be considered when selecting the best \nclocking/converter solution. \nData Sheet AD9517-0\nRev. F | Page 77 of 80 LVPECL CLOCK DISTRIBUTION \nThe LVPECL outputs of the AD9517 provide the lowest jitter \nclock signals that are available from the AD9517. The LVPECL \noutputs (because they are open emitter) require a dc termination to bias the output transistors. The simplified equivalent circuit in \nFigure 59 shows the LVPECL output stage. \nIn most applications, an LVPECL far-end Thevenin \ntermination (see Figure 71) or Y-termination (see Figure 72) is \nrecommended. In each case, the V\nS of the receiving buffer \nshould match the V S_LVPECL  voltage. If it does not, ac coupling is \nrecommended (see Figure 73). In the case of Figure 73, pull-down resistors of <150 Ω are not recommended when V\nS_LVEPCL  = 3.3 V; if \nused, damage to the LVPECL drivers may result. The minimum \nrecommended pull-down resistor size for V S_LVPECL  = 2.5 V is 100 \nΩ. \nThe resistor network is designed to match the transmission line \nimpedance (50 Ω) and the switching threshold (V S − 1.3 V). \nVS_LVPECL\nLVPECL50Ω\n50ΩSINGLE-ENDED\n(NOT COUPLED)VSVS_DRV\nLVPECL127Ω 127Ω\n83Ω 83Ω\n06424-145\nFigure 71.

AC-Coupled LVPECL with Parallel Transmission Line LVPECL Y-termination is an elegant termination scheme that \nuses the fewest components and offers both odd- and even-mode \nimpedance matching. Even-mode impedance matching is an important consideration for closely coupled transmission lines \nat high frequencies. Its main drawback is that it offers limited \nflexibility for varying the drive strength of the emitter-follower LVPECL driver. This can be an important consideration when driving long trace lengths but is usually not an issue. In the case shown in Figure 72, where V\nS_LVPECL  = 2.5 V, the 50 Ω \ntermination resistor that is connected to ground should be changed to 19 Ω. \nThevenin-equivalent termination uses a resistor network to \nprovide 50 Ω termination to a dc voltage that is below V\nOL of \nthe LVPECL driver. In this case, V S_LVPECL  on the AD9517 \nshould equal V S of the receiving buffer.  Although the resistor \ncombination shown in Figure 72 results in a dc bias point of V\nS_LVPECL  − 2 V, the actual common-mode voltage is V S_LVPECL  − \n1.3 V because additional current flows from the AD9517  LVPECL \ndriver through the pull-down resistor. \nThe circuit is identical when V S_LVPECL  = 2.5 V, except that the pull-\ndown resistor is 62.5 Ω and the pull-up resistor is 250 Ω. \nLVDS CLOCK DISTRIBUTION \nThe AD9517 provides four clock outputs (OUT4 to OUT7) that \nare selectable as either CMOS or LVDS level outputs. LVDS is a \ndifferential output option that  uses a current mode output \nstage. The nominal current is 3.5 mA, which yields 350 mV output swing across a 100 Ω resistor. An ou tput current of 7 mA is also \navailable in cases where a larger output swing is required. The LVDS output meets or exceeds all ANSI/TIA/EIA-644 specifications. \nA recommended termination circuit for the LVDS outputs is \nshown in Figure 74.  \nVS VS\nLVDS100Ω\nDIFFERENTIAL (COUPLED)LVDS 100Ω\n06424-047\nFigure 74.

F | Page 78 of 80 CMOS CLOCK DISTRIBUTION \nThe AD9517 provides four clock outputs (OUT4 to OUT7) \nthat are selectable as either CMOS or LVDS level outputs. \nWhen selected as CMOS, each output becomes a pair of CMOS outputs, each of which can be individually turned on or off and \nset as noninverting or inverting. These outputs are 3.3 V CMOS \ncompatible.  \nWhenever single-ended CMOS clocking is used, some of the \nfollowing general guidelines should be used. \nPoint-to-point nets should be designed such that a driver has \nonly one receiver on the net, if possible. This allows for simple termination schemes and minimizes ringing due to possible mismatched impedances on the net.  \nSeries termination at the source is generally required to provide \ntransmission line matching and/ or to reduce current transients \nat the driver. The value of the resistor is dependent on the \nboard design and timing requirements (typically 10 Ω to 100 Ω is \nused).  \nCMOS outputs are also limited in terms of the capacitive load \nor trace length that they can dr ive. Typically, trace lengths of \nless than 3 inches are recommended to preserve signal rise/fall times and preserve signal integrity.  \nCMOS CMOS10Ω60.4Ω\n(1.0 INCH)\nMICROSTRIP\n06424-076 \nFigure 75. Series Termination of CMOS Output  Termination at the far end of th e PCB trace is a second option. \nThe CMOS outputs of the AD9517  do not supply enough current \nto provide a full voltage swing with a low impedance resistive, far-end termination, as shown in Figure 76. The far-end \ntermination network should match the PCB trace impedance and \nprovide the desired switching point. The reduced signal swing may still meet receiver input requirements in some applications. This can be useful when driving long trace lengths on less critical nets. \nCMOS CMOS10Ω50Ω\n100Ω100ΩVS\n06424-077 \nFigure 76.

The AD9517 offers both LVPECL and \nLVDS outputs that are better suited for driving long traces where the inherent noise immunity of differential signaling provides superior performance for clocking converters. \n \nData Sheet AD9517-0\n \nRev.
