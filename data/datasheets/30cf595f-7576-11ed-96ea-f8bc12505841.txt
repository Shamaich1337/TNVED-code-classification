The amplifier provides 1 5.5 dB of \ngain, 2.5 dB noise figure, 2 6 dBm output third -order intercept \n(OIP3), and 2 0 dBm o f output power for  1 dB compression \n(P1dB) while requiring 53 mA from a 5  V supply. The ADL9006  is self biased  with only a single positive supply needed to \nachieve  a supply  current (IDD) of 53 mA.  \nThe ADL9006 amplifier input  and output are internally \nmatc hed to 50 Ω.  \n

Architecture and Simplified Schematic   Though the gate bias  voltages of the upper field effect transistors \n(FETs ) are set internally  by a resistive voltage divider tapped off \nof V DD, the V GG2 pin is provided to allow the user an optional \nmeans of changing the gate bias of the upper FETs. Adjustment \nof the V GG2 pin voltage  across the range of − 2.0 V to +2.6 V  \nchanges the g ate bias of the upper FETs, thus affecting gain \nchanges, depending on the frequenc y (see Figure 17). \n \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet ADL9006  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 13 of 14 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nBIASING PROCEDURES  \nCapacitive bypassing is required for V DD, as shown in the typical \napplication circuit in Figure 38. Gain control is possible through \nthe application of a dc voltage to the V GG2 pin. If gain control is \nused, V GG2 must be bypassed by a 100 pF capacitor, a 0.01 μF \ncapacitor, and a 4.7 μF capacitor. If gain control is not used, V GG2 \ncan be either left open or capacitively bypassed, as shown in \nFigure 38.  \nThe recommended bias sequence during power-up is as follows:  \n1. Set V DD to 5 V (this setting results in an I DD near its \nspecified typical value). \n2. If the gain control function is used, apply a voltage within \nthe range of −2.0 V to +2.6 V to V GG2 until the desired gain is \nachieved. \n3. Apply the RF input signal.  \nThe recommended bias sequence during power-down is as follows:  \n1. Turn off the RF input signal.  \n2. Remove the V GG2 voltage or set it to 0 V .  \n3. Set V DD to 0 V .  Unless otherwise noted, all measurements and data shown were \ntaken using the typical application circuit (see Figure 38), biased per the conditions in the Specifications section. The bias con-ditions shown in the Specifications section are the operating \npoints recommended to optimize the overall performance of \nthe device. Operation using other bias conditions may provide performance that differs from what is shown in this data sheet. To obtain the optimal performance while not damaging the device, follow the recommended biasing sequences outlined in this section. \nVGG2\nRFINRFOUTVDD\n0.01µF 100pF 4.7µF\n0.01µF 100pF 4.7µF2 31\n21\n4\n17307-040 \nFigure 38.
