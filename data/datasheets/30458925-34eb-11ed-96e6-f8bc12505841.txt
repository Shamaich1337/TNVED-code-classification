It is \ndesigned on a linear compatible CMOS (LC2MOS) process, \nwhich provides low power dissipation yet achieves a high \nswitching speed and a low on resistance. \nThe on-resistance profile is very flat over the full analog input \nrange, ensuring good linearity and low distortion when switching \naudio signals. High switching speed also makes the device suitable for video signal switching. CMOS construction ensures ultralow power dissipation, making the device ideally suited for portable, \nbattery-powered instruments. \nWhen they are on, each switch conducts equally well in both \ndirections and has an input signal range that extends to the \npower supplies. In the off condition, signal levels up to the supplies are blocked. All switches exhibit break-before-make \nswitching action for use in multiplexer applications. Low charge \ninject is inherent in the design. PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Extended signal range. The ADG333A  is fabricated on an \nenhanced LC2MOS process, giving an increased signal \nrange which extends to the supply rails. \n2. Low power dissipation. \n3. Low R ON. \n4. Single-supply operation. For applications in which the \nanalog signal is unipolar, the ADG333A  can be operated \nfrom a single rail power supply. The device is fully specified with a single 12 V supply. \n \n \nData Sheet ADG333A \n \nRev.

V SS should \nbe connected to GND when operating with a single  supply. \nWhen  using a dual supply , the ADG333A  can a lso operate  with \nunbalanced supplies; for example V DD = 20 V and V SS = −5  V.  \nThe only restrictions are that V DD to GND must not exceed \n30 V,  V SS to GND must not drop below − 30 V , and V DD to V SS \nmust not exceed +44 V . It is important to remember that the \nADG333A  supply voltage directly affects the input signal  range, \nthe switch on  resistance and the switching times of the  device . \nThe effects of the power supplies on these characteristics  can be \nclearly seen from the Typical Performance Characteristics  curves . POWER SUPPLY SEQUENCING  \nWhen using CMOS devices , care must be taken to ensure \ncorrect power -supply sequencing. Incorrect power -supply  \nsequencing can result in the dev ice being subjected to stresses  \nbeyond those listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings . This is  \nalso true for the ADG333A . Always turn  on VDD first, follow ed \nby V SS and the logic signals. An external signal within  the maxi -\nmum specified ratings can then be safely presented to  the source  \nor drain of the switch . \n \nData Sheet ADG333A \n \nRev.

### Component Summary: ADG333ABRSZ-REEL

**Description:**
The ADG333A is a quad single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch designed using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. It features four independently selectable switches, making it suitable for various applications requiring low power dissipation and high switching speed. The device is particularly effective in audio and video signal switching due to its low on-resistance and fast switching times.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Dual Supply: VDD = ±15 V (max ±20 V), VSS = -15 V (min -30 V)
  - Single Supply: VDD = +12 V (max +30 V), VSS = 0 V
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Continuous Current (S or D): 20 mA
  - Peak Current (Pulsed at 1 ms, 10% Duty Cycle Max): 40 mA
- **Power Consumption:**
  - IDD: 0.05 mA (typ), 0.25-0.35 mA (max)
  - ISS: 0.01 µA (typ), 15 µA (max)
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40°C to +85°C
- **Package Type:**
  - 20-Lead Shrink Small Outline Package (SSOP)
- **Special Features:**
  - Low on-resistance (45 Ω max)
  - Low ∆RON (5 Ω max)
  - Low RON match (4 Ω max)
  - Fast switching times (tON < 175 ns, tOFF < 145 ns)
  - Low leakage currents (5 nA max)
  - Low charge injection (10 pC max)
  - Break-before-make switching action
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The ADG333A is widely used in:
- **Audio and Video Switching:** Ideal for routing audio and video signals with minimal distortion.
- **Battery-Powered Systems:** Its low power consumption makes it suitable for portable devices.
- **Test Equipment:** Used in various testing setups where signal routing is required.
- **Communication Systems:** Effective in switching applications within communication devices.
