contain statements about the suitability of our products for certain areas of application. \nThese statements are based on our knowledge of typical requirements that are often placed on our products

We nevertheless expressly point out that such statements cannot be regarded as \nbinding statements about the suitability of our products for a particular customer application. As a rule, BM is either \nunfamiliar with individual customer applications or less familiar with them than the customers themselves. For these \nreasons, it is always ultimately incumbent on the customer to check and decide whether an BM product with the \nproperties described in the product specification is suitable for use in a particular customer application. \nIn individual cases, a malfunction of electronic components or failure before the end of their usual service life cannot be \ncompletely ruled out in the current state of the art, even if they are operated as specified. In customer applications \nrequiring a very high level of operational safety and especially in customer applications in which the malfunction or \nfailure of an electronic component could endanger human life or health (e.g. in accident prevention or lifesaving \nsystems), it must therefore be ensured by means of suitable design of the customer application or other action taken \nby the customer (e.g. installation of protective circuitry or redundancy) that no injury or damage is sustained by third \nparties in the event of malfunction or failure of an electronic component.  \n \n \n'}]
