The \ndevices integrate a hot-swap controller, 24m I power \nMOSFET, and electronic circuit-breaker protection in a \nsingle package. The ICs are designed for protection of \n2.7V to 18V supply voltages.\nThe devices provide inrush current control and short-\ncircuit detection during startup. During normal operation, \nthe devices provide circuit-breaker protection against \noverload and short-circuit conditions. The circuit-breaker \nfunction disconnects the power to the load if the load \ncurrent exceeds the circuit-breaker  limit. The devices \nare factory-calibrated to deliver accurate overcurrent \nprotection with Q10% accuracy. During a fault condi -\ntion, the MAX5976A enters an autoretry mode while the \nMAX5976B latches off. Both versions feature a resistor-\nadjustable variable speed circuit-breaker threshold and \novertemperature protection. Additional features include \npower-good and fault indicator outputs.\nThe ICs are available in a 16-pin, 5mm x 5mm, TQFN-\nEP package and fully specified over the -40 °C to +85 °C \noperating temperature range.\n                                Applications\nRAID Systems\nStorage Bridge Bay\nDisk Drive Power\nServer I/O Cards\nIndustrial                                      Features\nS 2.7V to 18V Operating Voltage Range\nS 24mI Internal Power MOSFET\nS 7A Load Current Capability\nS No Sense Resistor Required\nS ±10% Circuit-Breaker Threshold Accuracy\nS Adjustable Circuit-Breaker Current\nS Variable Speed Circuit-Breaker Response\nS Thermal Protection\nS Power-Good and Fault Outputs\nS Latch-Off or Automatic Retry Options\nS Drive-Present Signal Input\nS Active-Low and Active-High Enables19-5542; Rev 1; 4/11\nNote:  All devices are specified over the -40 °C to +85 °C \noperating temperature range.\n+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\n*EP = Exposed pad.

The ICs turn on the output only when V ON1 \nis high (V ON1 > 1.21V) while ON2 and PRESDET  are \nlow. The devices turn off the output when V ON1 falls \nbelow 1.21V - V HYS or whenever ON2 or PRESDET  are \nabove V IH. A resistive divider from IN to ON1 and ground \nprovides the flexibility to set the undervoltage lockout \nthreshold to any desired level between V UVLO  and 18V. \nSee Figure 1 and Setting the Undervoltage Threshold  in \nthe Applications Information  section.\nStartup\nOnce the MAX5976A/MAX5976B output is enabled, the \ndevice provides controlled application of power to a load. \nThe voltage at OUT will begin to rise at approximately \n18kV/s until the programmed circuit-breaker current level \nis reached, at which time the MAX5976A/MAX5976B will \nactively limit inrush current at the circuit-breaker setting. Because of this, the inrush current can be easily pro -\ngrammed by appropriate selection of R CB. This startup \nmode of operation will continue for up to 16ms; after the \nstartup time elapses, the output will either have risen to \nthe IN potential, or if the device is still in current limit, it \nwill shut down and assert the FAULT output low.\nThe resulting dV OUT/dt during startup can be deter -\nmined according to the following equation:\ndVOUT/dt ≈ (ICB - ILOAD )/COUT\nIn this equation, I LOAD  is any current drawn by a load \ndevice during the output ramp time that does not charge \nCOUT. Make certain that R CB is chosen such that:\nVIN x COUT/(ICB - ILOAD ) < 16ms\nThis ensures that the output capacitance can be fully \ncharged before the 16ms startup timer elapses.\nAn open-drain power-good output goes high-impedance \n16ms (typ) after the output has risen to more than 90% of \nthe input voltage to indicate a successful startup.\nCharge Pump\nAn integrated charge pump provides the gate-drive volt -\nage for the internal power MOSFET. The charge pump \ngenerates +5V potential above V IN to fully enhance the \ninternal power MOSFET.\nCircuit-Breaker Comparator\nThe current through the internal power MOSFET is com -\npared to a circuit-breaker threshold. An external resistor \nbetween CB and ground sets this threshold.\nThe circuit-breaker comparator is designed so that the \nload current can exceed the threshold for some amount \nof time before tripping. The time delay varies inversely \nwith the overdrive above the threshold. The greater the \novercurrent condition, the faster the response time allow -\ning the devices to tolerate load transients and noise near \nthe circuit-breaker threshold.\nThe ICs also feature catastrophic short-circuit protec -\ntion. During normal operation, if OUT is shorted directly \nto ground, a fast protection circuit forces the gate of the \ninternal MOSFET to discharge quickly and disconnect \nthe output from the input.\nAutoretry/Latch-Off\nDuring a fault condition, the devices turn off the inter -\nnal MOSFET disconnecting the output from the input. \nThe MAX5976A enters an autoretry mode with a fixed \n250ms lockout time before reconnect can occur. The \nMAX5676B latches off and remains off until the enable \nlogic is cycled off and on.Figure 1. Undervoltage Threshold SettingTable 1.

REG provides power to the internal circuit \nblocks of the ICs and must not be loaded externally. REG \nrequires a 1 FF capacitor to ground for proper operation.\nFault Status Output ( FAULT )\nFAULT  is an open-drain output that pulls low when a cur -\nrent limit or an overtemperature fault shutdown occurs. \nFAULT  remains low until the next startup cycle. FAULT  is \ncapable of sinking up to 5mA when asserted.\nThermal Protection\nThe devices enter a thermal shutdown mode in the event \nof overheating caused by excessive power dissipation \nor high ambient temperature. When the junction tem -\nperature exceeds T J = +150NC (typ), the internal thermal \nprotection circuitry turns off the internal power MOSFET. \nThe devices recover from thermal shutdown mode once \nthe junction temperature drops by 20 NC (typ).\n               Applications Information\nSetting the Undervoltage Threshold\nThe devices feature an independent ON/OFF control \n(ON1) for the internal MOSFET. The devices operate \nwith a 2.7V to 18V input voltage range and has a default \n2.5V (typ) undervoltage lockout threshold. The internal \nMOSFET remains off as long as V IN < 2.5V and/or V ON1 \n< VON1_TH . The undervoltage lockout threshold is pro -\ngrammabl e using a resistive divider between ON1 and \nGND (Figure 1). When V IN is greater than 2.7V and V ON1 \nexceeds the 1.21V (typ) threshold, the gate of the inter -\nnal MOSFET enhances to 5V, with respect to V IN and the devices' internal switch goes into normal operation. Use \nthe following equation to calculate the resistors values for \nthe desired undervoltage threshold:\nIN\nON1_THVR1 -1 R2V\uf8eb \uf8f6\n= × \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ed \uf8f8\nwhere V IN is the desired turn-on voltage for the output \nand V ON1 is 1.21V. R1 and R2 create a resistive divider \nfrom V IN to ON1. During normal operating conditions, \nVON1 must remain above its 1.21V (typ) threshold. If \nVON1 falls 100mV (V ON1_HYS ) below the threshold, the \ninternal MOSFET turns off, disconnecting the load from \nthe input.\nSetting the Current Limit\nAn external resistor from CB to ground sets the current \nlimit for the devices.
