It is also excellent  for improving vocal clarity in com -\nmunications  and public address systems. A low noise voltage \ncontroll ed amplifier (VCA) provides a gain that is dynamically \nadjusted by a control loo p to maintain a set compression charac -\nteristic. The  compression ratio is set by a single resistor and can \nbe varied from  1:1 to over 10:1 relative to the fixed rotation \npoint.  Signals above  the rotation point are limited to prevent \noverload and to eliminate popping. A downward expander (noise  \ngate) prevents  amplification  of background noise or hum. This \nresults in optimized signal levels prior to digitization, thereby \neliminating the need for additional  gain or attenuation in the \ndigital domain. The flexibility of setting  the compression ratio \nand the time constant of the level detector,  coupled with two \nvalues of rotation point, make the SSM2167 easy to integrate in \na wide vari ety of microphone conditioning  applications.  \nThe device is available in a 10 -lead MSOP package, and is \nguaranteed  for operation over the extended industrial \ntemperature  range of − 40°C to +85°C.

G | Page 8 of 12 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nThe SSM2167 is a complete microphone signal conditioning \nsystem on a single integrated circui t. Designed prima rily for \nvoice -band applications, this integrated circuit provides ampl i-\nfication , limiting, variable compression, and noise gate. User \nadjustable compression ratio, noise gate threshold, and two \ndifferent fixed gains optimize circuit operation for a varie ty of \napplications.

Functional Block Diagram  \nTHEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe typical transfer characteristic for the SSM2167 is shown in \nFigure 2 where the output level in dB is plotted as a function of \nthe input level in dB. The dotted line indicates the transfer ch ar-\nacteristic for a unity -gain amplifier. For input signals in the range  \nof V DE (downward expansion) to V RP (rotation point) , an “r” dB \nchange in the input level causes a 1 dB change in the output level.  \nHere,  r is defined as the compression ratio. The compression ratio  \nmay be varied from 1: 1 (no compression) to 10:1 via a single \nresistor, R COMP. Input signals above V RP are compressed with a \nfixed compression ratio of approximately 10:1. This region of operation is the limiting region. Varying the compression ratio has no effect on the limiti ng region.  The breakpoint between the compression region and the limit ing \nregion is referred to as the limiting threshold or the rotation point.  \nThe term , rotation point , derives from the o bservation that the \nstraight line in the compression region rotates  about this point on \nthe input/output characteristic as the compre ssion ratio is changed . \nThe gain of the system with an input signal level of V\nRP is the fixed \ngain, 18 dBV f or the SSM2167 , regardless of the compression ratio . \nInput signals below V DE are d ownward expanded; that is, a \n−1 dB change in the input signal level causes approximately a \n−3 dB change in the output level. As a result, the gain of the \nsystem is small for very small input signal levels, even though  it may be quite lar ge for small input signals above  V\nDE. The \nexter nal resistor at Pin 7, RGATE, is used to set the downward \nexpansion thr eshold (VDE). \nFinally, the SSM21 67 provides an active low, CMOS -compatible \ndigital power -down feature that reduce s device supply current \nto typically less than 2 µ A. \nSIGNAL PATH \nFigure 16 illustrates the block diagram of the SSM2167. The \naudio input signal is processed by the input buffer and then by \nthe VCA. The input buffer presents an input impedance of \napproximately  100 kΩ  to the source. A dc voltage of approximately \n400 mV is present at INPUT (Pin 5 ) of the SSM2167 , requiring the  \nuse of a blocking capacitor (C1) fo r ground -referenced sources. \nA 0.1 µ F capacitor is a good choice for most audio applications. \nThe input buffer is a unity -gain stable amplifier that can drive \nthe low impedance input of the VCA and an internal rms detector.  \nThe VC A is a low distortion, variable gain amplifier whose gain \nis set by the side -chain control circuitry. An external blocking \ncapacit or (C2) mu st be used between the buffer output and the \nVCA input. The 1 kΩ  impedance between amplifiers determines  \nthe value of this capacitor, which is typically between 4.7 µ F and \n10 µF. An aluminum electrolytic capacitor is an economical choice.  \nThe VCA amplifies the input signal current flowing through C2  \nand converts this current to a voltage at the output pin (Pin 9) of  \nthe SSM2167. The net gain from input to output can be as high \nas 40 dB, depending on the gain set by the control circuitry.  \nThe output impedance of the SSM2167 is typically less than 145 Ω, and the ext ernal load on Pin 9 should be > 5 kΩ. The \nnominal output dc voltage of the device is approximately 1.4 V;  \ntherefore , a blocking capacitor for grounded loads must be used.  \nThe bandwidth of the SSM2167 is quite wide at all gain settings. \nThe uppe r 3 dB point is over 1 MHz at gains as high as 30 dB. \nThe GBW plots are shown in Figure 5. The lower 3 dB cutoff \nfrequency of the SSM2167 is set by the input impedance of the \nVCA (1 k Ω) and C2. Whe reas the noise of the input buffe r is \nfixed, the input -referred noise of the VCA is a function of gain. \nThe VCA input noise is designe d to be at a minimum when the \ngain is at a maximum, thereby maximizing the usable dynamic range of the part.  \nData Sheet SSM2167\n \nRev. G | Page 9 of 12 LEVEL DETECTOR \nThe SSM2167 incorporates a full-wave rectifier and a true rms \nlevel detector circuit whose averaging time constant is set by an \nexternal capacitor (C AVG) connected to the AVG CAP (Pin 6). \nFor optimal low frequency operation of the level detector down \nto 10 Hz, the value of the capacitor should be 2.2 μF. Some experi-\nmentation with larger values for C AVG may be necessary to reduce \nthe effects of excessive low frequency ambient background noise. The value of the averaging capacitor affects sound quality: too small a value for this capacitor may cause a pumping effect for some signals, whereas too large a value can result in slow response \ntimes to signal dynamics. Electrolytic capacitors are recommended \nhere for lowest cost and should be in the range of 2 μF to 22 μF. \nThe rms detector filter time constant is approximately given by \n10 × C\nAVG milliseconds where C AVG is in μF. This time constant \ncontrols both the steady state averaging in the rms detector as well as the release time for compression, that is, the time it takes for the system gain to increase due to a decrease in input signal. The \nattack time, the time it takes for the gain to be reduced because \nof a sudden increase in input level, is controlled mainly by internal circuitry that speeds up the attack for large level changes. In most \ncases, this limits overload time to less than 35 ms. \nThe performance of the rms level detector is illustrated in \nFigure 14 for a C\nAVG of 2.2 μF and Figure 13 for a C AVG of 22 μF. \nIn Figure 13 and Figure 14, the input signal to the SSM2167 \n(not shown) is a series of tone bursts in six successive 10 dB \nsteps. The tone bursts range from −66 dBV (0.5 mV rms) to −6 dBV (0.5 V rms). As illustrated in these figures, the attack time of the rms level detector is dependent only on C\nAVG, but the \nrelease times are linear ramps whose decay times are dependent \non both C AVG and the input signal step size. The rate of release is \napproximately 240 dB/s for a C AVG of 2.2 μF, and 12 dB/s for a \nCAVG of 22 μF. \nCONTROL CIRCUITRY \nThe output of the rms level detector is a signal proportional to the log of the true rms value of the buffer output with an added \ndc offset. The control circuitry subtracts a dc voltage from this signal, scales it, and sends the result to the VCA to control the \ngain. The gain control of the VCA is logarithmic—a linear change \nin control signal causes a dB change in gain. It is this control law that allows linear processing of the log rms signal to provide the flat compression characteristic on the input/output charac-\nteristic shown in Figure 2. \nOUTPUT (dB)\nINPUT (dB)VRP VDE10:1\n5:1\n2:1\n1:1\n1\n1VCA GAIN\n02628-018 \nFigure 17. Effect of Varying the Compression Ratio \nSETTING THE COMPRESSION RATIO \nChanging the scaling of the control signal fed to the VCA causes \na change in the circuit compression ratio, r. This effect is shown \nin Figure 17. Connecting a resistor (R COMP) between Pin 8 and \nVDD sets the compression ratio. Lowering R COMP gives smaller \ncompression ratios as indicated in Table 4. AGC performance is achieved with compression ratios between 2:1 and 10:1, and is dependent on the application. Shorting R\nCOMP disables the AGC \nfunction, setting the compression equal to 1:1. If using a compres-sion resistor, using a value greater than 5 kΩ is recommended. \nIf a value lower than 5 kΩ is used, the device may interpret this \nas a short, 0 Ω. \nTable 4.

G | Page 10 of 12 SETTING THE NOISE GATE THRESHOLD \n(DOWNWARD EXPANSION) \nThe noise gate threshold is a programmable point using an external \nresistor (R GATE) that is connected between Pin 7 (GATE THRS) \nand V DD. The downward expansion threshold may be set between \n−40 dBV and −55 dBV , as shown in Table 5. The downward \nexpansion threshold is inversely proportional to the value of this resistance: setting this resistance to 0 Ω sets the threshold at approximately 10 mV rms (−40 dBV), whereas a 5 kΩ resistance sets the threshold at approximately 1 mV rms (−55 dBV). This \nrelationship is illustrated in Figure 18. It is not recommended  \nto use more than 5 kΩ for the R\nGATE resistor because the noise \nfloor of the SSM2167 prevents the noise gate from being \nlowered further without causing problems. \nTable 5.

Effects of Varying the Downward \nExpansion (Noise Gate) Threshold ROTATION POINT (LIMITING) \nInput signals above a particular level, the rotation point, are \nattenuated (limited) by internal circuitry. This feature allows the \nSSM2167 to limit the maximum output, preventing clipping of the following stage, such as a codec or ADC. The rotation point for the SSM2167 is set internally to −24 dBV (63 mV rms). \nSHUTDOWN FEATURE \nThe supply current of the SSM2167 can be reduced to under 10 μA by applying an active low, 0 V CMOS-compatible input \nto the SHUTDOWN\n pin (Pin 3) of the SSM2167. In this state, \nthe input and output circuitry of the SSM2167 assumes a high \nimpedance state; as such, the potentials at the input pin and the output pin are determined by the external circuitry connected to the SSM2167. The SSM2167 takes approximately 200 ms to settle from a shutdown to power-on command. For power-on to shutdown, the SSM2167 requires more time, typically less than \n1 sec. Cycling the power supply to the SSM2167 can result in \nquicker settling times: the off-to-on settling time of the SSM2167 is less than 200 ms, whereas the on-to-off settling time is less than 1 ms. The SSM2167 shutdown current is related to both temper-\nature and voltage. \nPCB LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS \nBecause the SSM2167 is capable of wide bandwidth operation \nand can be configured for as much as 60 dB of gain, special care \nmust be exercised in the layout of the PCB that contains the IC \nand its associated components. The following applications hints \nshould be considered for the PCB. \nThe layout should minimize possible capacitive feedback from \nthe output of the SSM2167 back to its input. Do not run input \nand output traces adjacent to each other. \nA single-point (star) ground implementation is recommended \nin addition to maintaining short lead lengths and PCB runs. In applications where an analog ground and a digital ground are \navailable, the SSM2167 and its surrounding circuitry should be \nconnected to the analog ground of the system. As a result of these recommendations, wire-wrap board connections and \ngrounding implementations are to be explicitly avoided. \n \n \nData Sheet SSM2167\n \nRev.
