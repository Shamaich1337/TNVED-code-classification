The connectors are  \nautomatically or manually placed on the board, then soldered in the same operationas the SMT components. Despite  this, the mechanical strength of the TMT soldering is maintained – still an important requirement for connectors  nowadays in many industrial or automotive applications.\nPLASTIC MATERIAL\nMinitek PiP headers are molded in high temperature  thermoplastic and are able to withstand exposure to  260°C peak temperature for 30 seconds maximum in a  convection, infra-red or vapour phase reflow oven.\nPIN LENGTH\nThe connector lead length beyond the bottom of the  PCB is shorter than for traditional TMT products. Thus,  the risk of pushing out the solder paste when inserting  the pin into the PCB hole is very much limited. The  solder paste will not stick on the pin tip or even fall off  completely, but stays around the pin for free flow during soldering. Amphenol FCI uses a solder tail length of 2 ± 0.2mm for Minitek Headers for a standard PCB of 1.6mm thickness. CONNECTOR DESIGN\nIn order to achieve optimum soldering results, Amphenol FCI launches dedicated Pin-in-Paste connectors in the basics+  product range. These connectors are fully adapted to Pin-in-Paste processing in all aspects, including plastic  material, housing design, pin length, and packaging.\nHOUSING DESIGN\nStandoffs raise the housing body slightly above the  PCB surface and thus allow the molten solder paste  to flow freely from its printed position into the board  hole and around the pin. The standoffs are correctly  positioned for a good solder paste deposit around the  pin. Please respect the stencil design guidelines below in order to avoid paste deposit around the standoffs.\nPACKAGING\nTFor combining SMT and TMT components not only in  the soldering process, but also in the assembly process,  Amphenol FCI proposes a choice of pick-and-place packaging for  PiP connectors. The most common part numbers are  available in tape-on-reel packaging, all others in tube.\nSHROUDED\n\nwww.amphenol-cs.comDisclaimer\nPlease note that the above information is subject to change
