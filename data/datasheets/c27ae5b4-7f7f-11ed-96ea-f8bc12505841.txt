Despite their low power consumption , the amplifiers provide excellent performance with  \n125 MHz small signal bandwidth and 60  V/µs slew rate. Analog \nDevices, Inc., proprietary XFCB process enables high speed and \nhigh performance on low power.  \nThis family of amplifiers exhibits true single- supply o peration \nwith rail -to-rail input and output performance for supply voltages  \nranging from 2.7 V to 12 V . The input voltage range extends 200 mV beyond each rail without phase reversal. The dynamic \nrange of the output extends to within 40  mV of each rail.  \nThe AD8029/AD8030/AD8040 provide excellent signal quality \nwith minimal power dissipation. At G = +1, SFDR is –72 dBc at \n1 MHz and settling time to 0.1% is only 80 ns. Low distortion \nand fast settling performance make these amplifiers suitable \ndrivers for sin gle-supply analog -to-digital  converters.  \nThe versatility of the AD8029/AD8030/AD8040 allows the user \nto operate the amplifiers on a wide range of supplies while con -\nsuming less than 6.5 mW of power. These features extend the operation time in applications ranging from battery -powered \nsystems with large bandwidth requirements to high speed systems where component density requires lower power dissipation.  The AD8040W is an automotive grade version, \nqualified for automotive applications.  \nThe AD8029/AD8030 are the only low power, rail- to-rail input \nand output high speed amplifiers available in SOT23 and SC70 micro packages. The amplifiers are rated over the extended \nindustrial temperature range, –40°C to +125°C.  \nTIME (µs) 03679-A-010VOLTAGE (V)\n00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.55.0\n1µs/DIVG = +1\nVS = +5V\nRL = 1kΩ TIED TO MIDSUPPLYINPUT\nOUTPUT\n \nFigure 5.

This is a stress \nrating only; functional operation of the device at these or any \nother conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect \ndevice reliability.  \nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIP ATION  \nThe maximum safe power dissipation in the AD8029/AD8 030/ \nAD8040 package is limited by the associated rise in junction \ntemperature (T J) on the die. The plastic encapsulating the die \nlocally reaches the junction temperature. At approximately \n150°C, which is the glass transition temperature, the plastic change s its properties. Even temporarily exceeding this \ntemperature limit may change the stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric \nperformance of the AD8029/AD8030/AD8040. Exceeding a \njunction temperature of 175°C for an ex tended period can \nresult in changes in silicon devices, potentially causing failure.  \nThe still -air thermal properties of the package and PCB (θ\nJA), \nambient temperature ( TA), and the total power dissipated in the \npackage ( PD) determine the junction tempera ture of the die. \nThe junction temperature can be calculated as  \nTJ = TA + (P D × θJA) \nThe power dissipated in the package ( PD) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the package due to the load drive for all outputs. The qu iescent \npower is the voltage between the supply pins ( V\nS) times the \nquiescent current ( IS). Assuming the load ( RL) is referenced to \nmidsupply, the total drive power is V S/2 × I OUT, some of which is \ndissipated in the package and some in the load (V OUT × I OUT). \nThe difference between the total drive power and the load \npower is the drive power dissipated in the package.  \nPD = Quiescent Power  + (Total Drive Power  – Load Power ) \n( )\nLOUT\nLOUT S\nS S DRV\nRV VI V P2\n–2\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb× + × =  RMS output voltages should be considered.

Simplified Schematic  \n \nThe AD8029 (single), AD8030 (dual), and AD8040 (quad) are \nrail-to-rail input and output amplifiers fabricated using Analog \nDevices ’ XFCB process. The XFCB process enables the \nAD8029/ AD8030/AD8040 to operate on 2.7 V to 12 V supplies \nwith a 120  MHz bandwidth and a 60 V/µs slew rate. A \nsimplified sche -matic of the AD8029/AD8030/AD8040 is \nshown in Figure 50. \nINPUT STAGE  \nFor input common -mode voltages less than a set threshold \n(1.2 V below V CC), the resistor degenerated PNP differential \npair (comprising Q 1 toQ 4) carries the entire I TAIL current, \nallowing the input voltage to go 200 mV below –V S. Conversely, \ninput common -mode voltages exceeding the same threshold \ncause I TAIL to be routed away from the PNP differential pair and \ninto the NPN differential pair through transistor Q 9. Under this \ncondition, the input common- mode voltage is allowed to rise  \n200 mV above +V S while still maintaining linear amplifier \nbehavior. The transition between these two modes of operation leads to a sudden, temporary shift in input stage transconduc -\ntance, g\nm, and dc parameters (such as the input offset voltage \nVOS), whic h in turn adversely affect the distortion performance. \nThe SPD block shortens the duration of this transition, thus improving the distortion performance. As shown in Figure 50, \nthe input differential pair is protected by a pair of two series diodes, connected in anti -parallel, which clamp the differential \ninput voltage to approximately ±1.5  V.   OUTPUT STAGE  \nThe currents derived from the PNP and NPN input differential \npairs are injected into the current mirrors M BOT and M TOP, thus \nestablishing a common -mode signal voltage at the input of the \noutput buffer.  \nThe output buffer performs three functions:  \n1. It buffers and applies the desired signal voltage to the \noutput devices, Q 10 and Q 11. \n2. It senses the common- mode current level in the output \ndevices.  \n3. It regulates the output common -mode current by \nestablishing a common -mode feedback loop.  \nThe output devices Q 10 and Q 11 work in a common -emitter \nconfiguration, and are Miller -compensated by internal \ncapacitors, C MT and C MB. \nThe output voltage compliance is set by the output devices’ \ncollector resistance R C (about 25 Ω), and by the required load \ncurrent I L. For instance, a light equivalent load (5 kΩ) allows the \noutput voltage to swing to within 40 mV of either rail, while heavier loads cause this figure to deteriorate as R\nC × I L.\n \nData Sheet AD8029/AD8030/AD8040 \n \nRev.

Wideband Inverting Gain Configuration  \n \nOUTPUT LOADING S ENSITIVITY  \nTo achieve maximum performance and low power dissipation, \nthe des igner needs to consider the loading at the output of \nAD8029/AD8030/AD8040. Table 5 shows the effects of output \nloading and performance.  \nWhen operating at unity gain, the effective load at the amplifier \noutput is the  resistance (R L) being driven by the amplifier. For \ngains other than 1, in noninverting configurations, the feedback \nnetwork represents an additional current load at the amplifier \noutput. The feedback network (R F + R G) is in parallel with R L, \nwhich lowers the effective resistance at the output of the amplifier. The lower effective resistance causes the amplifier to supply more current at the output. Lower values of feedback \nresistance increase the current draw, thus increasing the \namplifier’s power dissipat ion.  For example, if using the values shown in Table 5 for a gain of 2, \nwith resistor values of 2.5 kΩ, the effective load at the output is \n1.67 kΩ. For inverting configurations, only the feedback resistor \nR\nF is in parallel with the output load. If the load is greater than \nthat specified in the data sheet, the amplifier can introduce \nnonlinearities in its open -loop response, which increases \ndistortion. Figure 53 and Figure 54 illustrate effective output \nloading and distortion performance.

This \ncan cause peaking and ringing in the amplifier’s respo nse if the \nRC time constant is too low. Figure 55 illustrates this effect. \nPeaking can be reduced by adding a small capacitor (1 pF –4 pF) \nacross the feedback resistor. The best way to find the optimal value of capac itor is to empirically try it in your circuit. Another \nfactor of higher resistance values is the impact it has on noise performance. Higher resistor values generate more noise. Each application is unique and therefore a balance must be reached \nbetween dist ortion, peaking, and noise performance. Table 5 \noutlines the trade -offs that different loads have on distortion, \npeaking, and noise performance. In gains of 1, 2, and 10, \nequivalent loads of 1 k Ω, 2 kΩ, and 5 k Ω are shown.  \nWith increasing load resistance, the distortion and – 3 dB \nbandwidth improve, while the noise and peaking degrade slightly.  \n \nRL = 5kΩ\nFREQUENCY (MHz)NORMALIZED CLOSED-LOOP GAIN (dB)\n1–8\n10 100 1000\n03679-A-0072\n10\n–1–2–3–4–5\n–6RL = 2.5kΩ\n–7RF = R L = 5kΩ\nRF = R L = 2.5kΩ\nRF = R L = 1kΩ\nG = +2G = +1RL = 1kΩVS = 5V\nVOUT = 0.1V p-p\n \nFigure 55.

B | Page 19 of 24 CIRCUIT CONSIDERATIONS  \nPCB Layout  \nHigh speed op amps require careful attention to PCB layout to \nachieve optimum performance. Particular care must be \nexercised to minimize lead lengths of the bypass capacitors. Excess lead inductance can influ ence the frequency response \nand even cause high frequency oscillations. Using a multilayer \nboard with an internal ground plane can help reduce ground \nnoise and enable a more compact layout.  \nTo achieve the shortest possible trace length at the inverting \ninput, the feedback resistor, R\nF, should be located the shortest \ndistance from the output pin to the input pin. The return node of the resistor R\nG should be situated as close as possible to the \nreturn node of the negative supply bypass capacitor.  \nOn multilaye r boards, all layers beneath the op amp should be \ncleared of metal to avoid creating parasitic capacitive elements. \nThis is especially true at the summing junction, i.e., the inver -\nting input, – IN. Extra capacitance at the summing junction can \ncause increa sed peaking in the frequency response and lower \nphase margin.  \nGrounding  \nTo minimize parasitic inductances and ground loops in high speed, densely populated boards, a ground plane layer is critical. \nUnderstanding where the current flows in a circuit is cri tical in \nthe implementation of high speed circuit design. The length of the current path is directly proportional to the magnitude of the parasitic inductances and thus the high frequency impedance of \nthe path. Fast current changes in an inductive ground r eturn \nwill create unwanted noise and ringing.  \nThe length of the high frequency bypass capacitor pads and \ntraces is critical. A parasitic inductance in the bypass grounding works against the low impedance created by the bypass capacitor. Because load curren ts flow from supplies as well as \nfrom ground, the load should be placed at the same physical \nlocation as the bypass capacitor ground. For large values of \ncapacitors, which are intended to be effective at lower \nfrequencies, the current return path length is  less critical.  Power Supply Bypassing  \nPower supply pins are actually inputs to the op amp. Care must \nbe taken to provide the op amp with a clean, low noise dc \nvoltage source.  \nPower supply bypassing is employed to provide a low imped -\nance path to ground f or noise and undesired signals at all \nfrequencies. This cannot be achieved with a single capacitor \ntype; but with a variety of capacitors in parallel the bandwidth \nof power supply bypassing can be greatly extended. The bypass \ncapacitors have two functions:  \n1. Provide a low impedance path for noise and undesired signals from the supply pins to ground.  \n2. Provide local stored charge for fast switching co nditions \nand minimize the voltage drop at the supply pins during \ntransients. This is typically achieved with large electrolytic \ncapacitors.  \nGood quality ceramic chip capacitors should be used and \nalways kept as close as possible to the amplifier package. A parallel combination of a 0.1  µF ceramic and a 10  µF electrolytic \ncovers a wide range of rejection for unwanted noise. The 10  µF \ncapacitor is less critical for high frequency bypassing and, in most cases, one per supply line is sufficient. The values of capacitors are circuit -dependant and should be determined by \nthe system’s requirements.  \nDESIGN TOOLS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT  \nAnalog Devices is committed to the design process by providing technical support and online design tools.
