Thedevice has a slight negative temperature coefficient, as\nshown in Figure 2 – Tri Temp. (i.e. if the temperature\nincreases the current will decrease). This negativetemperature coefficient will protect the LEDS by reducingthe current as temperature rises.\nThe CCR turns on immediately and is typically at 20% of\nregulation with only 0.5 V across it.\nThe device is capable of handling voltage for short\ndurations of up to 45 V so long as the die temperature does\nnot exceed 150 °C. The determination will depend on the\nthermal pad it is mounted on, the ambient temperature, thepulse duration, pulse shape and repetition.\nSingle LED String\nThe CCR can be placed in series with LEDs as a High Side\nor a Low Side Driver. The number of the LEDs can vary\nfrom one to an unlimited number. The designer needs tocalculate the maximum voltage across the CCR by taking the\nmaximum input voltage less the voltage across the LEDstring (Figures 7 and 8).\nFigure 7. \nFigure 8. \nHigher Current LED Strings\nTwo or more fixed current CCRs can be connected in\nparallel. The current through them is additive (Figure 9).\nFigure 9. \n\nNSI45030A\nwww. onsemi.com\n5Other Currents\nThe adjustable CCR can be placed in parallel with any\nother CCR to obtain a desired current. The adjustable CCRprovides the ability to adjust the current as LED efficiencyincreases to obtain the same light output (Figure 10).\nFigure 10. \nDimming using PWM\nThe dimming of an LED string can be easily achieved by\nplacing a BJT in series with the CCR (Figure 11).\nFigure 11. \nThe method of pulsing the current through the LEDs is\nknown as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and has become\nthe preferred method of changing the light level. LEDs beinga silicon device, turn on and off rapidly in response to the\ncurrent through them being turned on and off. The switching\ntime is in the order of 100 nanoseconds, this equates to amaximum frequency of 10 Mhz, and applications willtypically operate from a 100 Hz to 100 kHz. Below 100 Hzthe human eye will detect a flicker from the light emitted\nfrom the LEDs. Between 500 Hz and 20 kHz the circuit may\ngenerate audible sound. Dimming is achieved by turning the\nLEDs on and off for a portion of a single cycle. This on/off\ncycle is called the Duty cycle (D) and is expressed by theamount of time the LEDs are on (Ton) divided by the totaltime of an on/off cycle (Ts) (Figure 12).\nFigure 12. \nThe current through the LEDs is constant during the period\nthey are turned on resulting in the light being consistent withno shift in chromaticity (color). The brightness is in proportion\nto the percentage of time that the LEDs are turned on.\nFigure 13 is a typical response of Luminance vs Duty Cycle.\nFigure 13. Luminous Emmitance vs. Duty CycleDUTY CYCLE (%)100 90 80 70 60 50 40010003000 ILLUMINANCE (lx)2000\n3040006000\n20 10 05000\nLux\nLinear\nReducing EMI\nDesigners creating circuits switching medium to high\ncurrents need to be concerned about ElectromagneticInterference (EMI). The LEDs and the CCR switchextremely fast, less than 100 nanoseconds. To help eliminate\nEMI, a capacitor can be added to the circuit across R2.\n(Figure 11) This will cause the slope on the rising and falling\nedge on the current through the circuit to be extended. Theslope of the CCR on/off current can be controlled by thevalues of R1 and C1.\nThe selected delay / slope will impact the frequency that\nis selected to operate the dimming circuit. The longer thedelay, the lower the frequency will be. The delay time should\nnot be less than a 10:1 ratio of the minimum on time. The\nfrequency is also impacted by the resolution and dimming\nNSI45030A\nwww. onsemi.com\n6steps that are required. With a delay of 1.5 microseconds on\nthe rise and the fall edges, the minimum on time would be30 microseconds. If the design called for a resolution of 100dimming steps, then a total duty cycle time (Ts) of 3\nmilliseconds or a frequency of 333 Hz will be required.\nNSI45030A\nwww. onsemi.com\n7Thermal Considerations\nAs power in the CCR increases, it might become\nnecessary to provide some thermal relief. The maximumpower dissipation supported by the device is dependentupon board design and layout. Mounting pad configurationon the PCB, the board material, and the ambient temperature\naffect the rate of junction temperature rise for the part. When\nthe device has good thermal conductivity through the PCB,the junction temperature will be relatively low with highpower applications.
