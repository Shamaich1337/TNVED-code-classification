The\nTC1047 and TC1047A can accurately measure\ntemperature from -40°C to +125°C. With the TC1047,the supply voltage can vary between 2.7V and 4.4V.\nThe power supply range of the TC1047A is from 2.5V\nto 5.5V.\nThe output voltage range for these devices is typically\n100 mV at -40°C, 500 mV at 0°C, 750 mV at +25°C and\n1.75V at +125°C. A 10 mV/°C voltage slope output\nresponse allows for a predictable temperaturemeasurement over a wide temperature range. The\nTC1047 and TC1047A are packaged in 3-pin SOT-23B\npackages, making them ideal for space-criticalapplications.\nPackage Type\n \nTC1047A VDD = 2.5V to 5.5V\nVDDPIC®\nA/D\nVSSMicrocontroller\nConverter Note:  3-Pin SOT-23B is equivalent to JEDEC TO-236VOUTVSS\nVDD3-Pin SOT-23B(NOTE)\nTC1047/1047A\n1 23Precision Temperature-to-Voltage Converter\nTC1047/TC1047A\nDS21498D-page 2 \uf0e3 2001-2012 Microchip Technology Inc.1.0 ELECTRICAL \nCHARACTERISTICS\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings*\nSupply Voltage ......................................................+7V\nVoltage on Any Pin with Respect to Supplies:\n..................................................V SS -0.3 to V DD +0.3V\nOperating Temperature ......................-40°C to +125°C\nStorage Temperature Range ..............-55°C to +150°C*Stresses above those listed under "Absolute Maximum Rat-\nings" may cause permanent damag e to the device.
