Precautions for Soldering \nThe soldering temperature should be controlled as closely as possible to the conditions shown below, \nirrespectiveof whether a soldering iron or a reflow soldering method is used.  \n1) When Using Soldering Reflow  \nAn example of a temperature profile when lead(Pb) -free solder is used  \n \n\uf06c The soldering temperature profile is based on the package surface temperature \n(See the figure shown below, which is based on the package surface temperature.)  \n\uf06c Reflow soldering must be performed once or twice.  \n\uf06c The mounting should be completed with the interval from the first to the last mountings being 2 \nweeks.  \n \n2) When using soldering Flow  \n\uf06c Preheat the device at a temperature of 150 °C  (package surface temperature) for 60 to 120 \nseconds. \n\uf06c Mounting condition of 260 °C  within 10 seconds is recommended  \n\uf06c Flow soldering must be performed once.  \n \n3) When using soldering Iron  \n\uf06c Complete soldering within 10 seconds for lead temperature not exceeding 260 °C  or within 3 \nseconds not exceeding 350 °C  \n\uf06c Heating by soldering iron must be done only once per lead.  \n \n2. Precautions for General Storage  \n1) Avoid storage locations where devices may be exposed to  moisture or direct sunlight.  \n2) Follow the precautions printed on the packing label of the device for transportation and storage.  \n3) Keep the storage location temperature and humidity within a range of 5°C to 35°C and 45% to 75%, \nrespectively.  \n4) Do not store the products in locations with poisonous gases (especially corrosive gases) or in dusty  \nconditions.  \n5) Store the products in locations with minimal temperature fluctuations. Rapid temperature changes during  \nstorage can cause condensation, resulting in lead oxidation or corrosion, which will deteriorate the  \nsolderability of the leads.  \n6) When restoring devices after removal from their packing, use anti -static containers.  \n7) Do not allow loads to be applied directly to devices while they are in storage.  \n8) If devices have been stored for more than two years under normal storage conditions, it is recommended  \nthat you check the leads for ease of soldering prior to use.  \n\nTLP293 -4 \n                                                           2019-05-20 9 © 201 9 \nToshiba Electronic Devices & Storage Corporation  Option: Specification for Embossed- Tape Packing  \n(TP) for Mini -Flat Coupler  \n \n1.
