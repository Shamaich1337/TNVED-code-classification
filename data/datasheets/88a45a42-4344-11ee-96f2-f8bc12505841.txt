Its double-balanced FET con -\nfiguration achieves an outstanding combination of low conversion loss, low noise figure and high IP3 performance without the \nneed for a DC bias current, ideal for sensitive receiver applications including base stations, PCS, fixed satellite and more.  The \nmixer comes housed in a miniature, shielded 6-lead package (0.38 x 0.50 x 0.15”), saving space in tight PCB layouts.  \nFeature Advantages\nHigh IP3, +24 dBm typ.Minimizes third order intermodulation products and improves dynamic range in demanding environments \nwhere multiple carriers may be present.\nLow conversion loss, 7.5 dBPreserves signal integrity from input to output by reducing undesirable signal responses that can degrade \nsystem performance and enables lower NF front ends, improving system sensitivity.\nGood P1dB compression, +14 dBm at inputWhereas the 1-dB compression point of a diode-based mixer is typically 4 to 6 dB lower than the LO power \nlevel, the 1-dB compression point of HJK-372H+ FET-based mixer is +14 dBm higher than the LO signal \npower.

#### Description:
The HJK-372H+ is a surface mount, FET-based frequency mixer designed for high-performance applications. It operates across a wide frequency range and is characterized by its double-balanced configuration, which provides low conversion loss and high linearity without requiring a DC bias current. This makes it particularly suitable for sensitive receiver applications.

#### Typical Applications:
The HJK-372H+ is commonly used in:
- **Radar Systems**: For signal processing and frequency conversion.
- **Base Stations**: In cellular and PCS networks for efficient signal handling.
- **Fixed Satellite Communications**: To facilitate reliable communication links.
- **General RF Applications**: Where high dynamic range and low noise are critical.

This component is ideal for environments where multiple carriers may be present, as its high IP3 minimizes intermodulation distortion, thereby improving overall system performance. Its compact size also makes it suitable for space-constrained PCB layouts.
