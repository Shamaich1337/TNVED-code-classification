The low supply current of 500 µ A \n(typical) is critical for portable or densely packe d designs. In \naddition, the  rail-to-rail output swing provides greater dynamic \nrange and  control than s tandard video amp lifiers . \nThese products operate from sing le supplies as low as 2.7 V to \ndual supplies of ± 6 V . The fast settling times and wide output  \nswings recommend them for buffers to sampling A/D converters . \nThe output drive of 30 mA (sink and source) is needed for  \nmany audio and display applications; more output current can  \nbe supplied for limited durations. The OP x62 family is specified \nover the extended industrial  temperature range ( –40°C to \n+125° C). The single OP162 amplifiers are available in 8 -lead \nSOIC package.  The dual OP262 amplifiers are available in \n8-lead SOIC and TSSOP packages. The quad OP462 amplifiers \nare available in 14 -lead, narrow -body  SOIC and TSSOP \npackages.

H | Page 12 of 20 APPLICATIONS \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nThe OPx62 family is fabricated using Analog Devices’ high \nspeed complementary bipolar process, also called XFCB. Th is \nprocess trench isolates each transistor to lower parasitic capaci -\ntances for high speed performance. This high speed process has been implemented w ithout sacrificing  the excellent transistor \nmatching and overall dc performance  characteristic of Analog \nDevi ces’ complementary bipolar process. This makes the OPx62 \nfamily an excellent choice as an  extremely fast and accurate low \nvoltage op amp.  \nFigure 30 shows a simplified e quivalent schematic for the OP162 . \nA PNP differential pair is used at the input of the device. The cross connecting of the emitters lower s the transconductance  of \nthe input stage improv ing the slew rate of the  device. Lowering \nthe transconductance through cross connecting the emitters has \nanother advantage in that it provides a  lower noise factor than if \nemitter degeneration resistors were used. The input stage can \nfunction with the base voltages taken  all the way to the negative \npower supply, or up to with in 1 V of  the positive power supply.  \n \nFigure 30. Simplified Schematic  \nTwo complementary transistors in a common -emitter \nconfiguration  are used for the output stage. This allows the \noutput of the  device to swing to within 50 m V of either supply \nrail at load  currents less than 1 mA. As load current increases, \nthe maximum  voltage swing of the output decrease s. This is due \nto the collector -to-emitter saturation voltages of the output \ntransistors  increasing. The gain of the output stage , and conse -\nquently  the open -loop gain of the amplifier, is dependent on the \nload resistance connected at the output. Because the dominant  pole \nfrequency is inversely proportional to the open -loop gain, the \nunity -gain bandwidth of the device is not affecte d by the  load \nresistance. This is typically the case in rail -to-rail output  \ndevices.  OFFSET ADJUSTMENT  \nBecause the OP162/OP262/OP462 have  an exceptionally  low \ntypical offset voltage, adjustment to correct offset voltage  may \nnot be needed. However, the OP1 62 has pinouts  to attach  a \nnulling resistor. Figure 31 shows how  the OP162 offset voltage \ncan be adjusted by connecting a potentiometer  between Pin  1 \nand Pin 8, and connecting the wiper to  VCC. It is i mportant to \navoid accidentally connecting the wiper to V EE, as this can damage \nthe device. The recommended value for the potentiometer is 20 kΩ. \n \nFigure 31. Offset Adjustment Schematic \nRAIL -TO-RAIL OUTPUT  \nThe OP162/OP262/OP462 ha ve a wide output voltage range \nthat extends to within 60  mV of each supply rail with a load \ncurrent of 5 mA. Decreasing the load current extends the output \nvoltage range even closer to the supply rails. The common -mode \ninput range ext ends from ground to within 1  V of the  positive \nsupply. It is recommended that there be some minimal  amount \nof gain when a rail -to-rail output swing is desired. The minimum \ngain required is based on the supply voltage and can be fo und as  \n1−=\nSS\nV,minVVA  \nwhere VS is the positiv e supply voltage. With a single -supply \nvoltage of 5 V , the minimum gain to achieve rail -to-rail output \nshould be 1.25.  \nOUTPUT SHORT -CIRCUIT PROTECTION  \nTo achieve a wide bandwidth and high slew rate, the output of the OP162/OP262/OP462 are not short -circuit protected. Shorting  \nthe output directly to ground or to a supply rail may destroy the device. The typical maximum safe output current is ±30 mA. Steps should be taken to ensure the output of the device will not be forced to source or sink more than 30 mA.  \nIn applications where some output current protection is needed,  \nbut not at the expense of reduced output voltage headroom, a  \nlow value resistor in series with the output can be used. This is  \nshown in Figure 32. The resistor is connected within the feed -\nback  loop of the amplifier so that if V\nOUT is shorted to ground  \n \n \n VCC\nVEE+IN\n–INVOUT00288-033–5V20kΩ\nOP162+5V\nVOS3\n24781\n6\n00288-034\nData Sheet  OP162/ OP262/OP462 \n \nRev. H | Page 13 of 20 and V IN swings up to 5 V , the output current will not exceed  \n30 mA.  For single 5 V supply applications, resistors less than \n169 Ω are not recommended.  \n \nFigure 32. Output Short- Circuit Protection  \nINPUT OVERVOLTAGE PR OTECTION  \nThe input voltage should be limited to ±6 V , or damage to the  \ndevice can occur. Electrostatic protection diodes placed in the  \ninput stage of the device help protect the amplifier from static  \ndischarge. Diodes are connected between each input as well as  \nfrom each input to both supply pins as shown in the simplified  \nequivalen t circuit in Figure 30. If an input voltage exceeds  either \nsupply voltage by more than 0.6 V , or if the differential  input \nvoltage is greater than 0.6 V , these diodes en ergize  causing  \novervoltage  damage.  \nThe input current  should be limited to less than 5  mA to \nprevent degradation or  destruction of the device by placing an \nexternal resistor in series with the input at risk of being  overdriven . \nThe size of the resistor can  be calculated by dividing the maxi -\nmum input voltage by 5 mA.  For example, if the differential \ninput voltage could reach 5 V ,  the external resistor should be \n5 V/5 mA = 1 k Ω. In p ractice,  this resist or should be placed in \nseries with both inputs to  balance  any offset voltages created by \nthe input bias current.  \nOUTPUT PHASE REVERSAL \nThe OP162/OP262/OP462 are  immune to phase reversal as \nlong  as the input voltage is limited to ±6  V.  Figure 27 shows the \noutput of a  device with the input voltage driven beyond  the \nsupply voltages. A lthough the device’s output does  not change \nphase, large currents due to input overvoltage could  result,  \ndamaging the device. In applications where the possibility  of an \ninput voltage exceeding the supply voltage exists, overvoltage \nprotection should be used, as described in the previous  section.  \nPOWER DISSIPATION  \nThe maximum power that can be safely dissipa ted by the  \nOP162/OP262/OP462 is limited by the associated rise in \njunction  temperature. The maximum safe junction temperature \nis 150°C ; device performance  suffer s when this limit is \nexceeded . If this maximum is  only  momentarily exceeded, \nproper  circuit ope ration will be restored as soon as the die \ntemperature  is reduced. Leaving the device in an “overheated” \ncondition for  an extended period can result in permanent \ndamage to the device.  \n To calculate the internal junction temperature of the OPx62,  use \nthe formula  \nTJ = PDISS × θJA + TA \nwhere:  \nTJ is the OPx 62 junction temperature.  \nPDISS is the OPx 62 power dissipation.  \nθJA is the  OPx62 package thermal resistance, junction -to-\nambient temperature.  \nTA is the a mbient temperature of the circuit.  \nThe power dissipated by the device can be calculated as  \nPDISS = ILOAD × (VS – VOUT) \nwhere:  \nILOAD is the OPx 62 output load current.  \nVS is the OPx 62 supply voltage. \nVOUT is the OPx62 output voltage.  \nFigure 33 and Figure 34 provide a convenient way to determine  \nif the device  is being overheated. The maximum safe power \ndissipation can  be found graphically, based on the package type \nand the ambient  temperature around the package. By using the \nprevious  equation, it is a simple matter to see if P DISS exceeds the \nde vice’s  power derating curve. To ensure proper operation, it is \nimportant  to obs erve the recommended derating curves shown \nin Figure 33 and Figure 34. \n \nFigure 33.

Maximum Power Dissipation vs. Temperature for  \n14-Lead  Package Types  \nUNUSED AMPLIFIERS  \nIt is recommended that any unused amplifiers in a dual or a  \nquad package be configured as a unity -gain  follower with a \n1 kΩ fe edback resistor connected from the inverting input to \nthe output , and the noninverting input tied to the ground plane.  \nPOWER -ON SETTLING TIME  \nThe time it tak es for the output of an op amp to settle after a  \nsupply voltage is delivered can be an important consideration in  \nsome power -up-sensitive applications. An example of this \nwould be in an A/D converter where the time until valid data  \ncan be produced after po wer-up is important.  \nThe OPx62 family has a rapid settling time after power -up. \nFigure 35 shows the OP462 output settling times for a single -\nsupply  voltage of V S = +5 V . The test circuit in Figure 36 was \nused to find the power -on settling times for the device.  \n \nFigure 35. Oscilloscope Photo of V S and V OUT  \n  \nFigure 36. Test Circuit for Power- On Settling Time \nCAPACITIVE LOAD DRIV E \nThe OP162/OP262/OP462 are  high speed, extremely accurate \ndevice s that tolerate some capacitive loading at their  output s. As \nload capacitance increases, unity -gain bandwidth  of an OPx62 \ndevice  decrease s. Th is also causes an increase  in overshoot and \nsettlin g time for the output. Figure 38 shows  an example of this \nwith the device configured for unity gain and  driving a 10 k Ω \nresistor and 300 pF capacitor placed in parallel.  \nBy connecting a series R -C network, commonly called a \n“snubber”  network, from the output of the device to ground, \nthis ringing can be eliminated and overshoot can be \nsignificantly  reduced. Figure 37 shows how to set up the \nsnubber network,  and Figure 39 shows the improvement in \noutput response with  the network added.  \n \nFigure 37.

Crosstalk vs. Frequency  \nPCB LAYOUT CONSIDERA TIONS  \nBecause the OP162/OP262/OP462 can provide gain s at high \nfreque ncy, careful attention to board layout and component  \nselection is recommended. As with any high speed application,  \na good ground plane is essential to achieve the optimum \nperformance.  This can significantly reduce the undesirable \neffects of  ground loops an d I × R losses by providing a low \nimpedance reference point. Best results are obtained with a \nmultilayer board  design with one layer assigned to ground \nplane.  \nUse c hip capacitors for supply bypassing, with one  end of the \ncapacitor connected to the ground plane and the  other end \nconnected within 1/8 inch of each power pin. An  additional \nlarge tantalum electrolytic capacitor (4.7 µF to 10 µF) should be \nconnected in parallel. This capacitor provide s current  for fast , \nlarge -signal changes at the device’s outpu t; therefore, it does not \nneed to  be placed as close to the supply pins.  \n \n00288-04210\n0%100\n90\n50mV 1µsVS = 5V\nAV = 1\nCL = 300pF\nRL = 10kΩ\nWITH SNUBBER:\n  RX = 140Ω\n  CX = 10nF\nCLOADBANDWIDTH (MHz)10\n789\n56\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n10pF 100pF 1nF 10nF\n00288-043FREQUENCY (Hz)THD+N (%)0.010\n0.001\n0.0001\n20 100 1k 10k 20k\n00288-044\nVS =±2.5V\nAV = 1\nVIN = 1.0V rms\nRL = 10kΩ\nBANDWIDTH:\n<10Hz TO 22kHz\nFREQUENCY (Hz)XTALK (dBV)–40\n–90–80–70–60–50\n–140–130–120–110–100\n20 100 1k 10k 20k\n00288-045�AV = 1\nVIN = 1.0V rms\n          (0dBV)\nRL = 10kΩ\nVS =±2.5V\nOP162/OP262/OP462 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. H | Page 16 of 20 APPLICATIONS CIRCUITS \nSINGLE -SUPPLY STEREO  HEADPHONE DRIVER  \nFigure 43 shows a stereo headphone output amplifier that can  \noperate from a single 5 V supply. The reference voltage is  \nderived by dividing the supply voltage down with two 100 k Ω \nresistors. A 10 µ F cap acitor prevents power supply noise from  \ncontaminating the audio signal and establishes an ac ground for  \nthe volume control potentiometers.  \nThe audio signal is ac -coupled to each noninverting input  \nthrough a 10 µ F capacitor. The gain of the amplifier is con -\ntrolled  by the feedback resistors and is  (R2/R1) + 1. For this  \nexample, the gain is 6. By removing R1, the amplifier  would \nhave unity gain. T o short -circuit protect the output of  the \ndevice , a 169 Ω resistor is placed at the output in the feedback \nnetwork . This prevent s any damage to the device if the head -\nphone output beco mes shorted. A 270 µF capacitor is used at \nthe output to couple the amplifier to the  headphone. This value \nis much larger than that used for the  input because of the low \nimpedance of hea dphones, which can  range from 32 Ω  to 600 Ω  \nor more.  \n \nFigure 43. Headphone Output Amplifier INSTRUMENTATION AMPL IFIER  \nBecause of their  high speed, low offset voltages, and low noise  \ncharacteristics, the OP162/OP262/OP462 can be used in a wide  \nvariety of high speed applications, including precision instru -\nmentation  amplifiers.  Figure 44 shows an example of such an  \napplication.  \n \nFigure 44. High Speed Instrumentation Amplifier  \nThe differential gain of the cir cuit is determined by R G, where  \nGDIFFRA21+=  \nwith the R G resistor value in k Ω. Removing R G sets the circuit  \ngain to unity.  \nThe fourth op amp, OP462 -D, is optional and is used to \nimprove  CMRR by reducing any input capacitance to the \namplifier.  By shielding the input signal leads and driving the \nshield  with the common -mode voltage, input capacitance is \neliminated  at common -mode voltages. This voltage is derived \nfrom the  midpoint of the outputs of OP462 -A and OP462 -B by \nusing two  10 kΩ re sistors followed by OP462 -D as a unity -gain  \nbuffer.  \nIt is important to use 1% or better tolerance components for the  \n2 kΩ resistors , as the common -mode rejection is dependent on \ntheir ratios being exact. A potentiometer should also be connected \nin series with the OP462 -C noninverting input resistor to ground  \nto optimize common -mode rejection.  \nThe circuit in Figure 44 was implemented to test its settling  \ntime. The instrumentation amp was powered wit h −5 V , so the  \ninput step vo ltage went from − 5 V to + 4 V to keep the OP462 \nwithin its input range. Therefore, the 0.05% settling range is  \nwhen the output is within 4.5 mV .  Figure 45 shows the posi tive \nslope settling time to be 1 .8 µs, and  Figure 46 shows a settling \ntime of 3. 9 µs for  the negative slope.

Amplifier A1 provides gain that can be \nadjusted to meet the modem output drive requirements. Both \nA1 and A 2 are configured to apply the largest possible differential \nsignal to the transformer. The largest signal available on a single 5 V supply is approximately 4.0  V p-p into a 600  Ω transmission \nsystem. Amplifier A3 is configured as a difference amplifier to extract the receive information from the transmission line for amplification by A4. A3 also prevents the transmit signal from interfering with the receive signal. The gain of A4 can be adjusted  \nin the sam e manner as A1  to meet the modem’s  input signal \nrequ irements.
