A1 6 \n02/20/2022 \nGEN ERAL DESCRIPTION \n \nThe IS25LP 064A Serial Flash memory offers a versatile storage solution with high flexibility and performance in \na simplified pin count package. ISSI’s “Indus try Standard Serial Interface” F lash are for systems that require \nlimited space, a low pin count, and low power consumption . The device  is accessed through a 4 -wire SPI Interface \nconsisting of a Serial Data Input ( SI), Serial Data Output (SO), Serial Clock (SCK), and Chip Enable (CE#) pins, \nwhich can also be configured to serve as multi -I/O (see pin descriptions).  \n \nThe device supports Dual a nd Quad I/O as well as standard, Dual Output, and Quad Output SPI. Clock \nfrequencies of up to 133MHz allow for equivalent clock rates of up to 532MHz (133MHz x 4) which equates  to \n66Mbytes/s of data throughput. The IS25xP series of Flash adds support for D TR (Double Transfer  Rate ) \ncommands that transfer addresses and read data on both edges of the clock.  These transfer rates can outperform \n16-bit Parallel Flash memories allowing for efficient memory access to support XIP (execute in place) operation.  \n \nInitial state of the memory array is erased (all bits are set to 1) when shipped from the factory.  \n \nQPI (Quad Peripheral Interface) supports 2 -cycle instruction further reducing instruction times. Pages can be \nerased in groups of 4Kbyte sectors, 32Kbyte b locks, 64Kbyte blocks, and/or the entire chip. The uniform sector \nand block architecture allows for a high degree of flexibility so that the device can be utilized for a broad variety \nof applications requiring solid data retention.  \n \nGLOSSARY  \n \nStandard  SPI \nIn this operation, a 4 -wire SPI Interface is utilized, consisting of Serial Data Input  (SI), Serial Data Output (SO), \nSerial Clock (SCK), and Chip Enable (CE#) pins. Instructions are sent via the SI pin to encode instructions, \naddresses, or input data to t he device on the rising edge of SCK. The SO pin is used to read data or to check the \nstatus of the device . This device supports SPI bus operation modes (0,0) and (1,1).  \n \nMulti  I/O SPI \nMulti -I/O operation utilizes an  enhanced SPI protocol to allow the device to function with Dual Output, Dual Input \nand Output, Quad Output, and Quad Input and Output capability. Executing these instructions through SPI mode \nwill achieve double or quadruple the transfer bandwidth for REA D and PROGRAM operations.  \n \nQPI \nThe device supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations only when the device is switched from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the enter QPI (35h) instruction. The typical SPI protocol \nrequires that the byte-long instruction code being shifted into the device only via SI pin in eight serial clocks. The \nQPI mode utilizes all four I/O pins to input the instruction code thus requiring only two serial clocks. This can \nsignificantly reduce the SPI instruction overhead and improve system performance. Only QPI mode or \nSPI/Dual/Quad mode can be active at any given time. Enter QPI (35h) and Exit QPI (F5h) instructions are used \nto switch between these two modes, regardless of the non -volatile Quad Enable (QE) bit st atus in the Status \nRegister. Power Reset or Hardware/Software Reset will return the device into the standard SPI mode. SI and SO \npins become bidirectional I/O0 and I/O1, and WP# and HOLD# pins become I/O2 and I/O3 respectively during \nQPI mode.   \n \nDTR \nIn add ition to SPI and QPI features, the device  also supports Fast READ  DTR operation, which allows high data \nthroughput while running at lower clock frequencies. DTR READ mode uses both rising and falling edges of the \nclock to drive output, resulting in reducing input and output  cycles by half.  \n \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        4   \nRev.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \nFor the device  without dedicated  RESET#  \nSYMBOL  TYPE  DESCRIPTION  \nCE# INPUT  Chip Enable:  The Chip Enable (CE#) pin enables and disables the devices \noperation. When CE# is high the device is deselected and output pins are in a high \nimpedance state.  When deselected the devices non -critical internal circuitry power \ndown to allow minimal levels of power consum ption while in a standby state.  \nWhen CE# is pulled low the device will be selected and brought out of standby mode. \nThe device is considered active and instructions can be written to, data read, and \nwritten to the device. After power -up, CE#  must transition from high to low before a \nnew instruction will be accepted.  \nKeeping CE# in a high state deselects the device and switches it into its low power \nstate.  Data will not be accepted when CE# is high.  \nSI (IO0),  \nSO (IO1)  INPUT/OUTPUT  Serial Data Input, Serial Output, and IOs (SI, SO, IO0, and IO1):  \nThis device supports standard SPI, Dual SPI, and Quad SPI operation. Standard \nSPI instructions use the unidirectional SI (Serial Input) pin to write instructions, \naddresses, or data to the device on the rising edge of the Serial Clock (SCK). \nStandard SPI also uses the unidirectional SO (Serial Output) to read data or status \nfrom the device on the falling edge of the serial clock (SCK).  \nIn Dual and Quad SPI mode, SI and SO become bidirectional IO pi ns to write \ninstructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of the Serial Clock \n(SCK) and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of SCK. Quad SPI \ninstructions use the WP# and HOLD# pins as IO2 and IO3 respectively.  \nWP# (I O2)  INPUT/OUTPUT  Write Protect/Serial Data IO (IO2):  The WP# pin protects the Status Register from \nbeing written in conjunction with the SRWD bit. When the SRWD is set to “1” and \nthe WP# is pulled low, the Status Reg ister bits (SRWD, QE, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0)  \nare write -protected and vice -versa for WP# high. When the SRWD is set to “0”, the \nStatus Register is not write -protected regardless of WP# state.  \nWhen the QE bit is set to “1”, the WP# pin (Write Protect) function is not available \nsince this pin is us ed for IO2.  \nHOLD# (IO3) or \nRESET#  (IO3) INPUT/OUTPUT  HOLD# (IO3) or RESET#/  (IO3):  When the QE bit of Status Register is set to “1”, \nHOLD# pin or RESET# is not available since it becomes IO3. When QE=0 the pin \nacts as HOLD#  or RESET#. The pin defaults HOLD#.  \nRESET#  (IO3)  pin instead of HOLD#  (IO3)  can be supported  by optional part  \n(Call Factory).  \nThe HOLD# pin allows the device to be paused while it is selected. It p auses serial \ncommunication by the master device without resetting the serial sequence. The \nHOLD# pin is active low. When HOLD# is in a low state and CE# is low, the SO pin \nwill be at high impedance. Device operation can resume when HOLD# pin is brought \nto a high state.  \nIn optional device, RESET# pin is a hardware RESET signal. When RESET# is  \ndriven HIGH, the memory is in the normal operating mode. When RESET# is driven \nLOW, the memory enters reset mode and output is High -Z.

The devices support either of two SPI modes:  \n \nMode 0 (0, 0)  \nMode 3 (1, 1)  \n \nThe difference between these two modes is the clock pol arity. When the SPI master is in stand-by mode , the \nserial clock remains at “0” (SCK = 0) for Mode 0 and the clock remains at “1” (SCK = 1) for Mode 3.  Please refer \nto Figure 4.2 and Figure 4 .3 for SPI and QPI mode.  In both modes, the input data is latched on the rising edge of \nSerial Clock (SCK), and the output data is available from the falling edge of SCK.  \n \nFigure 4.1 Connection Diagram among SPI Master and SPI Slaves (Memory Devices)  \n \nNote s: \n1.

REGISTERS  \nThe device has various  sets of Reg isters: Status, Function, and Read.  \nWhen the register is read continuously, the same byte is output repeatedly until CE# goes HIGH.  \n6.1 STATUS REGISTER  \nStatus Register Format and Status Register Bit Definitions  are described in Table  6.1 & Table 6.2. \n \nTable 6.1  Status Register Format  \n Bit 7  Bit 6  Bit 5  Bit 4  Bit 3  Bit 2  Bit 1  Bit 0  \n SRWD  QE BP3 BP2 BP1 BP0 WEL  WIP \nDefault  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n \nTable 6.2  Status Register Bit Definition  \nBit Name  Definition  Read - \n/Write  Type  \nBit 0 WIP Write In Progress Bit:  \n"0" indicates the device is ready (default)  \n"1" indicates a write cycle is in progress and the device is busy  R Volatile  \nBit 1 WEL  Write Enable Latch:  \n"0" indicates the device is not write enabled (default)  \n"1" indicates the device is write enabled  R/W1 Volatile  \nBit 2 BP0 \nBlock Protection Bit: (See Table 6.4 for details)  \n"0" indicates the specific blocks are not write -protected (default)  \n"1" indicates the specific blocks are write -protected  R/W Non-Volatile  Bit 3 BP1 \nBit 4 BP2 \nBit 5 BP3 \nBit 6 QE Quad Enable bit:  \n“0” indicates the Quad output function disable (default)  \n“1” indicates the Quad output function enable  R/W Non-Volatile  \nBit 7 SRWD  Status Register Write Disable: (See Table 7.1 for details)  \n"0" indicates the Status Register is not write -protected (default)  \n"1" indicates the Status Register is write -protected  R/W Non-Volatile  \nNote1: WEL bit can be written by WREN and WRDI commands, but cannot by WRSR command.  \n \nThe BP0, BP1, BP2, BP3, QE, and SRWD are non-volatile memory cells that can be written by a Write Status \nRegister (WRSR) instruction. The default value of the BP0, BP1, BP2, BP3, QE, and SRWD bits were set to “ 0” \nat factory. The Status Register can be read by the Read Status Register (RD SR). \n \nThe function of Status Register bits are described as follows:  \n \nWIP bit : The Write In Progress (WIP) bit is read -only, and can be used to detect the progress or completion of a \nprogram or erase operation. When the WIP bit is “0”, the device is ready for write Status Reg ister, program or \nerase operation. When the WIP bit is “1”, the device is busy.  \n \nWEL bit : The Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit indicates the status of the internal write enable latch. When the WEL \nis “0”, the write enable latch is disabled and the write operations described in Table 6.3 are inhibited. When the \nWEL bit is “1”, the write operations are allowed. The WEL bit is set by a Write Enable (WREN) instruction. Each \nwrite register, program and erase instruction except for Set Read Regist er must be preceded by a WREN \ninstruction. The WEL bit can be reset by a Write Disable (WRDI) instruction. It will automatically reset after the \ncompletion of any write operation . \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        16   \nRev.

Refer to T able 6.4 for the Block Write Protection  (BP) bit settings. When a \ndefined combination of BP3, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits are set, the corresponding memory area is protected.  Any \nprogram or erase operation to that area will be inhibited.  \nNote:  A Chip Erase (C ER) instruction will be ignored  unless  all the Block Protection Bits are “0”s.  \n \nSRWD  bit: The Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit operates in conjunction with the Write Protection (WP#) \nsignal to provide a Hardware Protection Mode. When the SRWD is set to “0”, the Status Register is not write -\nprotected. When the SRWD is set to “1” and the WP# is pulled low (V IL), the  bits of Status Register (SRWD, QE, \nBP3, BP2, BP1,  BP0) become read -only, and a WRSR instruction will be ignored. If the SRWD is set to “1” and \nWP# is pulled high (V IH), the Status Register can be changed by a WRSR instruction.  \n \nQE bit : The Quad Enable (QE) is a non -volatile bit in t he Status Reg ister that allows quad operation. When the \nQE bit is set to “0”, the pin WP# and HOLD# are enable d. When the QE bit is set to “1”, the IO2 and IO3 pins are \nenable d. \n \nWARNING: The QE bit must  be set to 0 if WP# or HOLD#  pin is tied directly to the power supply.  \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        17   \nRev.

All write sequence will \nbe ignored  when Vcc drops to V WI. \n \nTable 7.1 Hardware Write Protection on Status Register  \nSRWD  WP#  Status Register  \n0 Low Writable  \n1 Low Protected  \n0 High Writable  \n1 High Writable  \nNote:  Before the execution of any program, erase or write Status/Function Register instruction, the Write Enable \nLatch (WEL) bit must be enabled by executing a Write Enable (WREN) instruction. If the WEL bit is not enabled, \nthe program, erase or write register instruction will be ig nored.  \n \n7.2 SOFTWARE WRITE PROTE CTION  \nThe IS25LP 064A also provides a software write protection feature . The Block Protection (TBS, BP3, BP2, BP1, \nBP0) bits allow part or the whole memory area to be write -protected.  \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        22   \nRev.

All instructions, addresses, and data are shifted in with the most significant bit (MS B) first  \non Serial Data Input (SI) or Seri al Data IOs (IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3). The input data on SI or IOs is latched on the \nrising edge of Serial Clock (SCK) for normal mode and both of rising and falling edges for DTR mode after Chip \nEnable (CE#) is driven low (V IL). Every instruction sequence star ts with a one -byte instruction code and is followed \nby address bytes, data bytes, or both address bytes and data bytes, depending on the type of instruction. CE# \nmust be driven high (V IH) after the last bit of the instruction sequence has been shifted in t o end the operation.  \n \nTable 8.1  Instruction Set  \nInstructio\nn  \nName  Operation  Mode  Byte0  Byte1  Byte2  Byte3  Byte4  Byte5  Byte6  \nNORD  Normal Read  \nMode  SPI 03h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Data out      \nFRD Fast Read  \nMode  SPI \nQPI 0Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Data out    \nFRDIO  Fast Read  \nDual I/O  SPI BBh A \n<23:16>  \nDual A \n<15:8>  \nDual A \n<7:0>  \nDual AXh(1),(2) \nDual Dual \nData out    \nFRDO  Fast Read  \nDual Output  SPI 3Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Dual \nData out    \nFRQIO  Fast Read  \nQuad I/O  SPI \nQPI EBh A \n<23:16>  \nQuad  A \n<15:8>  \n Quad  A \n<7:0>  \nQuad  AXh(1), (2) \nQuad  Quad  \nData out    \nFRQO  Fast Read  \nQuad Output  SPI 6Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Quad  \nData out   \nFRDTR  Fast Read  \nDTR Mode  SPI \nQPI 0Dh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Dual \nData out   \nFRDDTR  Fast Read  \nDual I/O DTR  SPI BDh A \n<23:16>  \nDual A \n<15:8>  \nDual A \n<7:0>  \nDual AXh(1), (2) \nDual Dual \nData out    \nFRQDTR  Fast Read  \nQuad I/O DTR  SPI \nQPI EDh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  AXh(1), (2) \nQuad  Quad  \nData out    \nPP Input Page  \nProgram  SPI \nQPI 02h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  PD \n(256byte)     \nPPQ  Quad Input  \nPage Program  SPI  32h \n38h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Quad PD  \n(256byte)      \nSER Sector Erase  SPI \nQPI D7h \n20h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nBER32 \n(32Kb)  Block Erase  \n32K SPI \nQPI 52h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nBER64 \n(64Kb)  Block Erase  \n64K SPI \nQPI D8h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nCER  Chip Erase  SPI \nQPI C7h \n60h             \nWREN  Write Enable  SPI \nQPI 06h             \nWRDI  Write Disable  SPI \nQPI 04h             \nRDSR  Read Status  \nRegister  SPI \nQPI 05h SR           \nWRSR  Write Status  \nRegister  SPI \nQPI 01h WSR  \nData            \n \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        23   \nRev.

A total of 24 address bits are shifted in , but only AMSB (most significant  bit) - A0 are \ndecoded. The remaining bi ts (A23 – AMSB+1) are ignored.  The first byte address ed can be at any memory location. \nUpon completion, any data on the SI will be ignored. Refer to Table 8. 2 for the related Address Key.  \n \nThe first byte data (D7 - D0) is shifted out on the SO line, MSB fi rst. A single byte of data, or up to the whole \nmemory array, can be read out in one NORMAL READ instruction. The address is automatically incremented by \none after each byte of data is shifted out. The read operation can be terminated at any time by driving  CE# high \n(VIH) after the data comes out. When the highest address of the device is reached, the address counter will roll \nover to the 000000h address, allowing the entire memory to be read in one continuous READ instruction.  \n \nIf the NORMAL READ instruction is issued while  an Erase, Program or Write operation is in process  (WIP=1) the \ninstruction is ignored and will not have  any effects on the current operation.  \n \nTable 8.2  Address Key  \nAddress  IS25LP 064A  \nAMSB – A0 A23 - A0 (A23=X)  \nX=Don’t Care  \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        26   \nRev.

A1 6 \n02/20/2022 \n8.3 HOLD OPERATION  \nHOLD# is used in conjunction with CE# to select the IS25LP064A. When the device is selected and a serial \nsequence is  underway, HOLD# can be used to pause  the serial communication with the master device without \nresetting the serial sequence. To pause, HOLD# is brought low while the SCK signal is low. To resume serial \ncommunication, HOLD# is brought high while the SCK signal is low (SCK may still toggle duri ng HOLD). Inputs \nto SI will be ignored while SO is in the high impedance state , during HOLD . \nNote:  HOLD is not supported in DTR mode  or with QE=1  or for the specific parts that do not have HOLD# pin.  \n \nTiming graph can be refere nced in AC Parameters Figure 9.4 \n \n8.4 FAST READ DUAL I/O  OPERATION  (FRDIO, BBh) \nThe FRDIO allows the address bits to be input two bits at a time. This may allow for code to be executed directly \nfrom the SPI in some applications.  \n \nThe FRDIO instruction code is followed by three address bytes (A23 – A0) and dummy cycles  (configurable, \ndefault is 4 clocks), transmitted via the IO 1 and IO 0 lines, with each pair of bits latched -in during the rising edge \nof SCK. The address MSB  is input on IO1, the next bit on IO0, and this shift pattern cont inues to alternate between \nthe two lines. Depending on the usage of AX read operation mode, a mode byte may be located after address \ninput . \n \nThe first data byte addressed is shifted out on the IO1 and IO0 lines, with each pair of bits shifted out at a maxi mum \nfrequency f CT, during the falling edge of SCK. The MSB  is output on IO1, while simultaneously the second bit is \noutput on IO0. Figure 8.4 illustrates the timing sequence.  \n \nThe first byte addressed can be at any memory location. The address is automatically incremented  by one  after \neach byte of data is shifted out. When the highest address is reached, the address counter will roll over to the \n000000h address, allowing the entire memory to be read with a single FRDIO instruction. FRDIO instructio n is \nterminated by driving CE# high (V IH). \n \nThe device supports the AX read  operation by applying mode bits  during dummy period . Mode bits consist of 8 \nbits, such as  M7 to M0.  Four cycles after address input are reserved for Mode bits in FRDIO execution . M7 to M4 \nare important for enabling this mode.  M3 to M0 become don’t care for future use.  When M[7:4]=1010(A h), it \nenables the AX read operation and subsequent FRDIO execution skips command code. It saves cycles as \ndescribed in Figure 8.5. When the code is  different from A Xh (where X is don’t care ), the device exits the AX read \noperation . After finishing the read operation, device  becomes ready to receive a new command. SPI or QPI mode \nconfiguration retains the prior setting.  Mode bit must be applied during dummy cycles. Number of dummy cycle in \nTable 6.10  includes number of mode bit cycles.  If dummy cycles is configured as 4 cycles, data output will starts \nright after mode bit applied.  \n \nIf the FRDIO  instruction is issued while  an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process  (WIP=1) the instruction is \nignored and will not affect  the current cycle . \n \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        30   \nRev.

This may allow for code to be \nexecuted directly from the SPI in some applications.  \n \nA Quad Enable (QE) bit of Status Register must be set to "1" before sending the F ast Read Quad I/O  instruction.  \n \nThe FRQIO instruction code is followed by three address bytes (A23 – A0) and dummy cycles  (configurable, \ndefault is 6 clocks), transmitted via the IO3, IO2, IO 1 and IO 0 lines, with each group of four bits latched -in during \nthe risin g edge of SCK. The address  of MSB  input s on IO3, the next bit on IO2, the next bit on IO1, the next bit \non IO0, and continue to shift in alternating on the four. Depending on the usage of AX read  operation mode, a \nmode byte may be located after address inp ut. \n \nThe first data byte addressed is shifted out on the IO3, IO2, IO1 and IO0 lines, with each group of four bits shifted \nout at a maximum frequency f CT, during the falling edge of SCK. The first bit ( MSB ) is output on IO3, while \nsimultaneously the second  bit is output on IO2, the third bit is output on IO1, etc. Figure 8.8 illustrates the timing \nsequence.  \n \nThe first byte addressed can be at any memory location. The address is automatically incremented after each \nbyte of data is shifted out. When the highest address is reached, the address counter will roll over to the 000000h \naddress, allowing the entire memory to be read with a single FRQIO instruction. FRQIO instruction is terminated \nby driving CE# high (V IH). \n \nThe device supports the AX read  operat ion by applying mode bits during dummy period. Mode bits consists of 8 \nbits, such as M7 to M0. Two cycles after address input are reserved for Mode bits in FRQIO execution. M7 to M4 \nare important for enabling this mode. M3 to M0 become don’t care for futur e use. When M[7:4]=1010(Ah), it \nenables the AX read  operation and subsequent FRQIO execution skips command code. It saves cycles as \ndescribed in Figure 8.9. When the code is different from AXh  (where X is don’t care ), the device exits the AX read  \noperation . After finishing the read operation, device becomes ready to receive a new command. SPI or QPI mode \nconfiguration retains the prior setting. Mode bit must be applied during dummy cycles. Number of dummy cycle in \nTable 6.10  includes number of mode bit cycles.

(SPI/QPI all acceptable)  \nFunction R egister bit2 (PSUS) and bit3 (ESUS) are used to check whether or not  the device is in suspend  mode.  \n \nSuspend to read ready timing  (tSUS): 100µs (MAX ) \nResume to another suspend timing  (tRS): 80µs (TYP)  \n \nSUSPEND DURING SECTO R-ERASE OR BLOCK -ERASE (PERSUS 75h/B0h)  \nThe Suspend command allows the interruption of Sector Erase and Block Erase operations. But Suspend \ncommand will be ignored during Chip Erase operation. After the Suspend  command , other commands include \narray read operation can be accepted.  \n \nBut Write Status Register command  (01h) and Erase instructions are not allowed during Erase Suspend. Also, \narray read for being erased sector/block is not allowed.  \n \nTo execute Erase Suspend operation, the host drives CE# low, sends the Suspend command cycle (75h/B0h), \nthen drives CE# high . The Function Register indicates that the Erase has been suspended by setting  the ESUS \nbit from “0” to “1”, but the device will not accept another command until it is ready. To determine when the device \nwill accept a new command, poll the WIP bit or wait the specified time t SUS. When ESUS bit is set to “1” , the Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) bit clears to “0” . \n \nSUSPEND DURING PAGE PROGRAMMING  (PERSUS 75h/B0h)  \nThe Suspend command also allows the interruption of all array Program operations. After the Suspend command, \nother commands include array read operation can be accepted  can be accepted.  \n \nBut Write Status Register instruction (01h) and Program instructions are not allowed during Pr ogram Suspend.  \nAlso, array read for being programmed page is not allowed.  \n \nTo execute the Program  Suspend operation, the host drives CE# low, sends the Suspend command cycle \n(75h/B0h), then drives CE# high. The Function Register indicates that the programm ing has been suspended by \nsetting  the PSUS bit from “0” to “1”, but the device will not accept another command until it is ready. To determine \nwhen the device will accept a new command, poll the WIP bit or wait the specified time t SUS. When PSUS bit is \nset to “1” , the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit clears to “0” . \n \n \nPROGRAM/ERASE RESUME  (PERRSM 7Ah/30h) \nThe Program/Erase Resume restarts the Program or Erase command that was suspended, and c lears the \nsuspend status bit in the Function Register (ESUS or PSUS bit s) to “0”. To execute the Program/Erase Resume \noperation, the host drives CE# low, sends the Program/Erase Resume command cycle (7Ah/30h), then drives \nCE# high. A cycle is two nibbles long, most significant nibble first. To issue another Erase Suspend oper ation \nafter Erase Resume  operation , Erase Resume to another Erase Suspend delay ( tRS) is required, but it could \nrequire longer Erase time to complete Erase operation.  \n \nTo determine if the internal, self -timed Write operation completed, poll the WIP bit . \n \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        55   \nRev.

During this mode,  standby current is reduced from I sb1 to I sb2. While in the Power -\ndown mode, the device is not active and all Write/Program/Erase instructions are ignored. The instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CE# pin low and shifting the instruction code into the d evice . The CE# pin must be driven \nhigh after the instruction has been latched, or Power -down mode will not engage. Once CE# pin driven high, the \nPower -down mode will be entered within the time duration of t DP. While in the Power -down mode only the Release \nfrom Power -down/RDID instruction, which restores the device to normal operation, will be recognized. All other \ninstructions are ignored, including the Read Status Register instruction which is always available during normal \noperation.

A1 6 \n02/20/2022 \nRead with “8/16/32 /64-Byte Wrap Around”  \n \nThe device is capable of burst read with wrap around in both SPI and QPI mode. The size of burst length is \nconfigurable by using P0, P1, and P2 bits in R ead Register. P2 bit  (Wrap enable) enables the burst  mode feature. \nP0 and P1 define  the size of burst. Burst lengths of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bytes are supported. By default, address \nincreases by one up t hrough the entire  array. By setting the burst length, the data being accessed can be limited \nto the length o f burst boundary within a  256 byte page. The first output will be the data at the initial address which \nis specified in the instruction. Following data will come out  from the next address within the  burst boundary. Once \nthe address reaches the end of bound ary, it will automatically move  to the first address of the boundary. CE# high \nwill terminate the command.  \n \nFor example, if burst length of 8 and initial address being applied is 0h, following byte output will be from address \n00h and continue to 01h,..,07h , 00h, 01h… until CE# terminate s the operation. If burst length of 8 and initial \naddress being applied is FEh(254 d), following byte output will be from address FEh and continue to FFh, F8h, \nF9h, FAh,  FBh,  FCh,  FDh, and repeat from FEh  until CE# terminate s the operation.  \n \nThe command, “SET READ PARAMETERS OPERATION  (C0h)”, is used to configure the b urst length. If the \nfollowing data input is one of “00h”,”01h”,”02h”, and ”03h”, the device will be in default operation mode. It will be \ncontinuous burst read of  the whole array. If the following data input is one of “04h”,”05h”,”06h”, and ”07h”, the \ndevice will set the burst length as 8,16,32 and 64 respectively.  \n \nTo exit the burst mode , another “C0 h” command  is necessary to set P2 to 0. Otherwise, the burst mode  will be \nretained until either power down or reset operation . To change burst length , another “C0 h” command should be \nexecuted to set P0 and P1 (Detail ed information in Table 6.8 Burst Length Data). All read commands operate in  \nburst  mode  once  the R ead Register is set to enable burst  mode . \n \nRefer to Figures 8.40  and 8.4 1 for instruction sequence.  \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        60   \nRev.

During \nthe Reset operation, the value of volatile registers will default back to the value in the corresponding non -volatile \nregister. This operation consists of two c ommands: Reset -Enable (RSTEN) and Reset (RST). The operation \nrequires the Reset -Enable command followed by the Reset command. Any command other than the Reset \ncommand after the Reset -Enable command will disable the Reset -Enable.  \n \nExecute the CE# pin low  → sends the Reset -Enable command (66 h), and drives CE# high. Next, the host drives \nCE# low again, sends the Reset command (99 h), and pulls C E# high.  \n \nOnly for the  parts that have the RESET#  function  option , Hardware Reset function is available. For all packa ges \nwith RESET# (IO3)  option except 16 -pin SOIC/24 -ball TFBGA with dedicated  RESET# function , the RESET# pin \nwill be solely applicable in SPI mode and when the QE bit is disabled. For 16 -pin SOIC/24 -ball TFBGA  package s \nwith dedicated  RESET# function , the RESET# pin  (or ball)  is always applicable regardless of the QE bit value.  \n \nThe dedicated RESET# pin  (or ball)  has an internal pull -up resistor and may be left floating if not used  The \nRESET# pin  (or ball)  has the highest priority among all the input signa ls and will reset the device to its initial \npower -on state  regardless of the state of all other pins ( CE#, IOs, SCK , and WP#) . \n \nIn order to activate Hardware Reset , the RESET# pin (or ball)  must be driven  low for a minimum period of t RESET  \n(100ns). Drive RESET# low for a minimum period of t RESET  will interrupt any on -going internal and external \noperations , release the device from deep power down mode1, disable all input signals , force the output pin enter \na state of high impedance, and reset all the read parameters.  The required wait time after activating a HW Reset \nbefore the device will accept another instruction (t HWRST ) is 35µs. \n \nIf a reset is initiated while a Write, Program, or Erase operation is in progress or suspended, the operation is \naborted and  data may be corrupted . \nNote 1: The Status and Function Registers remain unaffected.  \n \nFigure 8.50  Software Reset Enable and Software Reset Sequence  (RSTEN, 66h + RST, 99h)  \n \nInstruction = 66hCE#\nSCK\nSI0 1Mode 3\nMode 02 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction = 99h8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nSOHigh Impedance\n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        67   \nRev.

A1 6 \n02/20/2022 \n8.34 INFORMATION ROW PROG RAM  OPERATION  (IRP, 62h) \nThe Information Row Program (IRP) instruction allows up to 256 bytes  data to be programmed into the memory \nin a single operation. Before the execution of IRP instruction, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) must be enabled \nthrough a W rite Enable (WREN) instruction.  \n \nThe IRP instruction code, three address bytes and program data (1 to 256 bytes) should be sequentially input. \nThree address bytes has to be input as specified in the Table 8.6 Information Row Valid Address Range . Program \noperation will start once the CE# goes  high, otherwise the IRP instruction will not be executed. The internal control \nlogic automatically handles the programming voltages and timing. The progress or completion of the program \noperation can be determined by reading the WIP bit in Status Register via  a RDSR instruction. If the WIP bit is \n“1”, the program operation is still in progress. If WIP bit is “0”, the program operation has completed.  \n \nIf more than 256 bytes data are sent to a device, the address counter rolls over within the same page . The \npreviously latched data are discarded and the last 256 bytes data are kept to be programmed into the page. The \nstarting byte can be anywhere within the page.  When the end of the page is reached, the address will wrap \naround to the beginning of the same page. If the data to be programmed are less than a full page, the data of all \nother bytes on the same page will remain unchanged.  \nNote: A program operation can alter “1”s into “0”s, but an erase operation is required to change “0”s back to “1”s. A \nbyte cannot be  reprogrammed without first erasing the corresponding Information Row array which is one of \nIR0~3.  \n \nFigure 8.53  IRP (Information Row Program) Sequence  \n \nInstruction = 62h 23CE#\nSCK\nSI7 6\nSO73-byte Address\nHigh Impedance22...0Data In 1 Data In 2560 1 ... 7 8 9 ... 31 32 33 ... 39 ...\n2072\n...\n2079\nMode 3\nMode 0\n...0... ...0\n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        70   \nRev.

Then the first  data byte addressed is shifted out on \nthe SO line, with each bit shifted out at a maximum frequency f CT, during the falling edge of SCK.  \n \nThe address is automatically incremented by one after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the address reaches \nthe last address of each 256 byte Information Row, the next address will not be valid and the data of the address \nwill be garbage data. It is recommended to repeat four times IRRD operation that reads 256 byte with a valid \nstarting address of each Information Row in order to read all data in the 4 x 256 byte Information Row array. The \nIRRD  instruction is terminated by driving CE# high (VIH).  \n \nIf an IRRD  instruction is issued while  an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process  (WIP=1) the instruction is \nignored  and will not have  any effects on the current cycle . \n \nThe sequence of IRRD instruction is same as FAST READ except for the instruction code.

The address is latched on both rising and falling edge of SCK, and data of each bit shifts out on both rising \nand falling edge  of SCK at a maximum frequency . The 2 -bit address can be latched -in at one clock, and 2 -bit data \ncan be read out at one clock, which means one bi t at the rising edge of clock, the other bi t at the falling edge of \nclock.  \n \nThe first address byte can be at any location.

The \naddress (interleave on dual I/O pins) is latched on both rising and fall ing edge of SCK, and the data (interleave on \ndual I/O pins) shift out on both rising and falling edge  of SCK at a maximum frequency . The 4 -bit address can be \nlatched -in at one clock, and 4 -bit data can be read out at one clock, which means two bits at the rising edge of \nclock, the other two bits at the falling edge of clock.  \n \nThe first address byte can be at any location. The address is automatically increased to the next higher address \nafter each byte of data is shifted out, so the whole memory can be read  out with a single FRDDTR instruction. \nThe address counter rolls over to 0 when the highest ad dress is reached. Once writing FRDDTR instruction, the \nfollowing address/dummy/data out will perform as 4 -bit instead of previous 1 -bit. \n \nThe sequence of issuing FRDDTR instruction is: CE# goes low → Sending FRDDTR instruction (1 -bit per clock) \n→ 24-bit address interleave on IO1 & IO0 (4-bit per clock) → 2 dummy clocks (configurable  default is 2 clocks ) on \nIO1 & IO0 → Data out inte rleave on IO1 & IO0 (4-bit per clock) → End FRDDTR operation via pulling CE# high at \nany time during data out (Please refer to Figure 8.57 for 2 x I/O Double Transfer Rate Read Mode Timing \nWaveform).  \n \nIf AXh ( where X is don’t care ) is input for the mode bits during dummy cycles, the device will enter AX read \noperation mode which enables subsequent FRDDTR execution skips command code. It saves cycles as described \nin Figure 8.58. When the code is different from AXh , the device exits the AX read operation. After finishi ng the \nread operation, device becomes ready to receive a new command.  Since the number of dummy cycles and AX \nbit cycles are same in this case, X should be Hi -Z to avoid I/O contention . \n \nIf the FRDDTR instruction is issued while a Program/Erase/Write Status Register cycle is in progress (WIP=1), \nthe instruction will be rejected without any effect on the current cycle.  \n \n  \n                                                                                         IS25LP064A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        74   \nRev.

As a resu lt, 6 command cycles will be reduced by the FRQDTR QPI instruction. In \naddition, subsequent address and data out are shifted in/out via all four IO lines like the FRQDTR instruction.
