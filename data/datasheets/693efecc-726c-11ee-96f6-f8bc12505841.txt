The device \nis offered in multiple magnetic thresholds, sampling \nrates, output drivers, and packages to accommodate \nvarious applications.\nWhen the applied magnetic flux density exceeds the \nBOP threshold, the device outputs a low voltage. The \noutput stays low until the flux density decreases to \nless than B RP, and then the output either drives a \nhigh voltage or becomes high impedance, depending \non the device version. By incorporating an internal \noscillator, the device samples the magnetic field and \nupdates the output at a rate of 20 Hz, or 5 Hz for the \nlowest current consumption. Omnipolar and unipolar \nmagnetic responses are available.\nThe device operates from a V CC range of 1.65 V to \n5.5 V, and is packaged in a standard SOT-23, TO-92 \nand small X2SON.\nDevice Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nDRV5032SOT-23 (3) 2.92 mm × 1.30 mm\nX2SON (4) 1.10 mm × 1.40 mm\nTO-92 (3) 4.00 mm × 3.15 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nOUTDRV5032\nGPIOVCC\nController\nVCC\nGNDdistance\nN S\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nTypical Schematic\nTemperature ( qC)Average Supply Current ( PA)\n-40 -10 20 50 8000.20.40.60.811.21.4\nD0111.65 V\n3 V\n5.5 V\nCurrent Consumption of 5-Hz VersionDRV5032\nSLVSDC7F  – APRIL 2017 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe DRV5032 device is typically used to detect the proximity of a magnet. The magnet is often attached to a \nmovable component in the system.\n9.1.1 Output Type Tradeoffs\nThe push-pull output allows for the lowest system power consumption because there is no current leakage path \nwhen the output drives high or low. The open-drain output involves a leakage path through the external pullup \nresistor when the output drives low.\nThe open-drain outputs of multiple devices can be tied together to form a logical AND. In this setup, if any sensor \ndrives low, the voltage on the shared node becomes low. This can allow a single GPIO to measure an array of \nsensors.\n9.2 Typical Applications\n9.2.1 General-Purpose Magnet Sensing\nOUTDRV5032\nGPIOVCC\nController\nVCC\nGNDdistance\nN S\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 9-1.

To reliably activate the sensor, the \nmagnet must apply greater than the maximum specified B OP. In such a system, the sensor typically detects the \nmagnet before it has moved to the closest position. When the magnet moves away from the sensor, it must \napply less than the minimum specified B RP to reliably release the sensor.\nMagnets are made from various ferromagnetic materials that have trade-offs in cost, drift with temperature, \nabsolute max temperature ratings, remanence or residual induction (B r), and coercivity (H c). The B r and the \ndimensions of a magnet determine the magnetic flux density (B) it produces in 3-dimensional space. For simple \nmagnet shapes, such as rectangular blocks and cylinders, there are simple equations that solve B at a given \ndistance centered with the magnet.\nDistance\nDiameterThickness\nBS NThickness\nDistance\nB LengthWidth\nN S\nFigure 9-2.

Systems should have margin to \naccount for this, as well as for mechanical tolerances.DRV5032\nSLVSDC7F – APRIL 2017 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: DRV5032\n9.2.1.3 Application Curve\nDistance (cm)Magnetic Flux Density (mT)\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5051015202530354045505560\nD017\nFigure 9-3.

When the DRV5032FD is below the \ncenter of the magnet, it receives close to 0 mT, and both outputs drive high. If the switch with the embedded \nmagnet moves left or right, the sensor receives a north or south field, and OUT1 or OUT2 drive low. This \nprovides 3 digital states of detection.\nThe length of the magnet should ideally be two times the distance of travel toward each side. Then, when the \nswitch is pushed to either side, the outer edge of the magnet is positioned directly above the sensor where it \napplies the strongest perpendicular flux component.www.ti.comDRV5032\nSLVSDC7F – APRIL 2017 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: DRV5032\nTo determine the magnitude of magnetic flux density for a given magnet and distance, TI recommends to either \nuse simulation software, test with a linear Hall effect sensor, or test with a gaussmeter.\n9.2.2.3 Application Curve\nFigure 9-5  shows the typical magnetic flux lines around a 2-pole magnet.\nFigure 9-5.

A decoupling capacitor close to the \ndevice must be used to provide local energy with minimal inductance. TI recommends using a ceramic capacitor \nwith a value of at least 0.1 µF.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nMagnetic fields pass through most nonferromagnetic materials with no significant disturbance. It is common \npractice to embed Hall effect sensors within plastic or aluminum enclosures and sensing magnets on the \noutside. Magnetic fields also easily pass through most printed-circuit boards, which makes placing the magnet \non the opposite side possible.\n11.2 Layout Examples\nGNDVCC\nOUTGND OUTVCC SEL\nThermal \nPad\nGND OUT VCC\nFigure 11-1.
