The temperature proﬁle is divided into four process zones, each with diﬀerent /g39T//g39time tem-\nperature change rates or duration. The /g39T//g39time rates or \nduration are detailed in the above table.  The tempera-tures are measured at the component to printed circuit board connections.\nIn process zone P1 , the PC board and component pins are \nheated to a temperature of 150°C to activate the ﬂux in the solder paste. The temperature ramp up rate, R1, is limited to 3°C per second to allow for even heating of both the PC board and component pins.\nProcess zone P2  should be of suﬃcient time duration (100 \nto 180 seconds) to dry the solder paste. The temperature is raised to a level just below the liquidus point of the solder. Process zone P 3 is the solder reﬂow zone. In zone P3, the \ntemperature is quickly raised above the liquidus point of solder to 260°C (500°F) for optimum results. The dwell time above the liquidus point of solder should be between 60 and 120 seconds. This is to assure proper coalescing of the solder paste into liquid solder and the formation of good solder connections. Beyond the rec-ommended dwell time the intermetallic growth within the solder connections becomes excessive, resulting in the formation of weak and unreliable connections. The temperature is then rapidly reduced to a point below the solidus temperature of the solder to allow the solder within the connections to freeze solid. \nProcess zone P 4 is the cool down after solder freeze. \nThe cool down rate, R5, from the liquidus point of the solder to 25°C (77°F) should not exceed 6°C per second maximum. This limitation is necessary to allow the PC board and component pins to change dimensions evenly, putting minimal stresses on the component.\nIt is recommended to perform reﬂow soldering no more \nthan twice.50 100 150 200 250 300\nt-TIME\n(SECONDS)2580120150180200230255\n0T - TEMPERA TURE  (°C)\nR1R2R3 R4\nR5217MAX 260°C\n60 sec to 120 sec\nAbove  217°C\nP1\nHEAT\n UPP2\nSOLDER  PAS TE DRYP3\nSOLDER\nREFLOWP4\nCOOL  DOWN\n10Figure 11.

The proximity sensor is basically made up of the emitter (infrared LED) and detector (photodiode). The block diagram of the sensor is shown in Figure 13. The emitter will emit IR light pulse. This light travels out in the ﬁeld of view and will either hit an object or continue. No light will be reﬂected when no object is detected. On the other hand, the detector will detect the reﬂected IR light when it hits the object.\nFigure 1 3.
