This is an advanced regulation topology that combines the\nadvantages of hysteretic and current-mode control schemes.\nThe DCS-Control topology operates in PWM (pulse width modulation) mode for medium to heavy load conditions\nand in Power Save Mode at light load currents. In PWM mode, the converter operates with its 2.4-MHz nominal\nswitching frequency, having a controlled frequency variation over the input voltage range. Since DCS-Control\nsupports both operation modes (PWM and PFM) within a single building block, the transition from PWM mode to\nPower Save Mode is seamless and does not affect on the output voltage. The devices offer both excellent DC\nvoltage and superior load transient regulation combined with very low output voltage ripple.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nControl Logic\nReference Selection\nUVLO\nThermal Shutdown\nStartup Ramp\nGate \nDriver\nPGNDEN\nSW\nModulatorTON\nPGNDLS-FET\nForward Current Limit\nZero Current Detect\nNegative Current LimitHICCUPVIN\nComparatorDirect Control \n& \nCompensationHS-FET Forward \nCurrent Limit\nVSW\nVINVSET/MODE\nAGND+\n–+\n–FB\nVOS\nk k = 1, 0.5, 0.25EAVXVref\nRDIS\nAGND\nAGNDVSW–+ 91%\nVX\nAGNDPG\n34-µs\nDeglitch\n–+\n111%\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Power Save Mode\nAs the load current decreases, the device enters Power Save Mode (PSM) operation. PSM occurs when the\ninductor current becomes discontinuous, which is when it reaches 0 A during a switching cycle. Power Save\nMode is based on a fixed on-time architecture, as shown in Equation 1 .\ntON=VOUT\nVIN× 416 ns  \n(1)TPS62865, TPS62867\nSLUSDN8 – MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62865  TPS62867\nIn Power Save Mode, the output voltage rises slightly above the nominal output voltage. This effect is minimized\nby increasing the output capacitor or inductor value.\nWhen V IN decreases to typically 15% above V OUT, the TP6286x does enter Power Save Mode, regardless of the\nload current. The device maintains output regulation in PWM mode.\n8.3.2 Forced PWM Mode\nConnecting the VSET/MODE pin to logic high after the start-up, the device switches at 2.4 MHz, even with\na light load. This reduces the output voltage ripple and allows simple filtering of the switching frequency for\nnoise-sensitive applications. Efficiency at light load is lower in Forced PWM mode (FPWM).\n8.3.3 100% Duty Cycle Mode Operation\nThere is no limitation for small duty cycles since even at very low duty cycles, the switching frequency is reduced\nas needed to always ensure a proper regulation.\nIf the output voltage level comes close to the input voltage, the device enters 100% mode. While the high-side\nswitch is constantly turned on, the low-side switch is switched off. The difference between V IN and V OUT is\ndetermined by the voltage drop across the high-side MOSFET and the DC resistance of the inductor. The\nminimum V IN that is needed to maintain a specific V OUT value is estimated as:\nVIN,MIN=VOUT+(RDS(ON)+RL)IOUT,MAX  \n(2)\nwhere\n• V IN,MIN  is the minimum input voltage to maintain an output voltage\n• I OUT,MAX  is the maximum output current\n• R DS(on)  is the high-side FET ON-resistance\n• R L is the inductor ohmic resistance (DCR)\n8.3.4 Soft Start\nAfter enabling the device, there is a 700-µs (typical) enable delay (t delay) before the device starts switching. After\nthe enable delay, an internal soft start-up circuitry ramps up the output voltage with a period of 1 ms (t Ramp).\nThis avoids excessive inrush current and creates a smooth output voltage rise-slope. It also prevents excessive\nvoltage drops of primary cells and rechargeable batteries with high internal impedance. The device is able to\nstart into a pre-biased output capacitor. It starts with the applied bias voltage and ramps the output voltage to its\nnominal value.\nttDelaytVIN\nEN\nVOUT\nttRampt\nttStartup t\nFigure 8-1. Start-up Sequence\n8.3.5 Switch Current Limit and HICCUP Short-Circuit Protection\nThe switch current limit prevents the device from high inductor current and from drawing excessive current from\nthe battery or input voltage rail. Excessive current might occur with a shorted or saturated inductor or a heavy\nload or shorted output circuit condition. If the inductor current reaches the threshold I LIM, cycle by cycle, thewww.ti.comTPS62865, TPS62867\nSLUSDN8 – MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62865  TPS62867\nhigh-side MOSFET is turned off and the low-side MOSFET is turned on, while the inductor current ramps down\nto the low-side MOSFET current limit.\nWhen the high-side MOSFET current limit is triggered 32 times, the device stops switching. The device then\nautomatically re-starts with an internal soft start-up after a typical delay time of 128 µs has passed. This is\nnamed HICCUP short-circuit protection. The device repeats this mode until the high load condition disappears.\n8.3.6 Undervoltage Lockout\nTo avoid mis-operation of the device at low input voltages, undervoltage lockout (UVLO) is implemented when\nthe input voltage is lower than V UVLO. The device stops switching and the output voltage discharge is active\nwhen the device is in UVLO. When the input voltage recovers, the device automatically returns to operation with\nan internal soft start-up.\n8.3.7 Thermal Shutdown\nWhen the junction temperature exceeds T JSD, the device goes into thermal shutdown, stops switching, and\nactivates the output voltage discharge. When the device temperature falls below the threshold by the hysteresis,\nthe device returns to normal operation automatically with an internal soft start-up. During thermal shutdown, the\ninternal register values are kept.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Enable and Disable (EN)\nThe device is enabled by setting the EN pin to a logic high. In shutdown mode (EN = low), the internal power\nswitches and the entire control circuitry are turned off. An internal switch smoothly discharges the output through\nthe VOS pin in shutdown mode. Do not leave the EN pin floating.\n8.4.2 Power Good (PG)\nThe device has an open-drain power-good pin, which is specified to sink up to 1 mA. The power-good output\nrequires a pullup resistor connecting to any voltage rail less than 5.5 V. The PG has a deglitch delay of 34 µs.\nThe PG signal can be used for sequencing of multiple rails by connecting it to the EN pin of other converters.\nLeave the PG pin unconnected when not used.\nTable 8-1.

Table 8-2  shows the options.\nThe R2D converter has an internal current source that applies current through the external resistor and an\ninternal ADC that reads back the resulting voltage level. Depending on the level, the output voltage is set. Once\nthis R2D conversion is finished, the current source is turned off to avoid current flowing through the external\nresistor. Ensure that there is no additional current path or capacitance greater than 30 pF from this pin to GND\nduring R2D conversion. Otherwise, a false value is set.TPS62865, TPS62867\nSLUSDN8 – MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62865  TPS62867\nTable 8-2.

R1 and R2 are not needed.\n9.2.2.3 Output Filter Design\nThe inductor and the output capacitor together provide a low-pass filter. To simplify this process, Table 9-3\noutlines possible inductor and capacitor value combinations for most applications. Checked cells represent\ncombinations that are proven for stability by simulation and lab testing. Further combinations must be checked\nfor each individual application.\nTable 9-3.

To\ncalculate the maximum inductor current under static load conditions, Equation 4  is given.www.ti.comTPS62865, TPS62867\nSLUSDN8 – MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62865  TPS62867\n(4)\nwhere\n• I OUT,MAX  is the maximum output current\n• ΔI L is the inductor current ripple\n• f SW is the switching frequency\n• L is the inductor value\nIt is recommended to choose a saturation current for the inductor that is approximately 20% to 30% higher\nthan I L,MAX . In addition, DC resistance and size must also be taken into account when selecting an appropriate\ninductor. Table 9-4  lists recommended inductors.\nTable 9-4.

A low-ESR multilayer ceramic capacitor is recommended for the best filtering and must be placed\nbetween VIN and GND as close as possible to those pins. For most applications, 8 μF of effective  1 capacitance\nis sufficient, however, a larger value reduces input current ripple.\nThe architecture of the device allows the use of tiny ceramic output capacitors with low equivalent series\nresistance (ESR). These capacitors provide low output voltage ripple and are recommended. To keep its low\nresistance up to high frequencies and to get narrow capacitance variation with temperature, TI recommends\nusing X7R or X5R dielectrics. The recommended typical output capacitor value is 30 μF of effective  1\ncapacitance. This capacitance can vary over a wide range as outlined in the output filter selection table.\n1The effective capacitance is the capacitance after tolerance, temperature, and DC bias effects have been considered.TPS62865, TPS62867\nSLUSDN8 – MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62865  TPS62867\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nVIN = 5.0 V, V OUT = 0.9 V, T A = 25 °C, BOM = Table 9-2 , unless otherwise noted.\nOutput Current (A)Efficiency (%)\n0102030405060708090100\n1m 10m 100m 1 10VIN = 2.4 V – FPWM\nVIN = 2.4 V – PSM\nVIN = 3.3 V – FPWM\nVIN = 3.3 V – PSM\nVIN = 5.0 V – FPWM\nVIN = 5.0 V – PSM\nVOUT = 0.6 V\nFigure 9-2.

Ensure that the input\npower supply has a sufficient current rating for the application.www.ti.comTPS62865, TPS62867\nSLUSDN8 – MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62865  TPS62867\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nA proper layout is critical for the operation of any switched mode power supply, especially at high switching\nfrequencies. The PCB layout of the TPS62865 and TPS62867 devices requires careful attention to ensure\nbest performance. A poor layout can lead to issues like bad line and load regulation, instability, increased EMI\nradiation, and noise sensitivity. Refer to the Five Steps to a Great PCB Layout for a Step-Down Converter\ntechnical brief for a detailed discussion of general best practices. The following are specific recommendations for\nthe TPS62865 and TPS62867:\n• The input capacitor or capacitors must be placed as close as possible to the VIN and PGND pins of the\ndevice. This is the most critical component placement. Route the input capacitor or capacitors directly to the\nVIN and PGND pins, avoiding vias.\n• Place the output inductor close to the SW pins. Minimize the copper area at the switch node.\n• Place the output capacitor or capacitors ground close to the PGND pin and route it directly, avoiding vias.\nMinimize the length of the connection from the inductor to the output capacitor. Connect the VOS pin directly\nto the output capacitor.\n• Sensitive traces, such as the connections to the VOS, FB, and VSEL pins, must be connected with short\ntraces and be routed away from any noise source, such as the SW pin.\n• Make the connections from the input voltage of the system and the connection to the load as wide as\npossible to minimize voltage drops.\n• Have a solid ground plane between PGND and the input and output capacitor ground connections.\n• The sensitive signal ground connections for the feedback voltage divider must be connected to a separate\nsignal ground trace.\n11.2 Layout Example\nVOUT\nGNDVINVINSWGNDAGND FB VOSPG VSEL EN\nL1\nC1C2\nC4\nR1\nR2\nR4Solution  \nSize 63mm²C3\nFigure 11-1. Layout Example\n11.2.1 Thermal Considerations\nAfter the layout recommendations for component placement and routing have been followed, the PCB design\nmust focus on thermal performance. Thermal design is important and must be considered to remove the heat\ngenerated in the device during operation. The device junction temperature must stay below its maximum rated\ntemperature of 125°C for correct operation.\nUse wide traces and planes, especially to the PGND, VIN, and VOUT pins, and use vias to internal planes to\nimprove the power dissipation capability of the design. If the application allows it, use airflow in the system to\nfurther improve cooling.TPS62865, TPS62867\nSLUSDN8 – MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62865  TPS62867\nThe Thermal Information  table provides the thermal parameters of the device and its package based on the\nJEDEC standard 51-7.
