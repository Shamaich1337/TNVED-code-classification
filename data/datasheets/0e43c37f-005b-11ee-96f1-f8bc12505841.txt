It \ncontains a low power, high speed, 16 -bit sampling ADC with no \nmissing codes, an internal conversion clock, and a versatile serial interface port. The part also contains a low noise, wide bandwidth, \nshort aperture delay , track -and-hold circuit. On the CNV rising \nedge, it samples an analog input IN+ between 0 V to REF with \nrespect to a ground sense IN−. The reference voltage, REF, is \napplied externally and can be set up to the supply voltage.  \nPower dissipation scales linearly with throughput.  \nThe SPI -compatible seri al interface also features the ability , \nusing the SDI input, to daisy chain several ADCs on a single  \n3-wire bus or provides an optional BUSY indicator. It is \ncompatible with 1.8 V , 2.5 V , 3 V , or 5 V logic using the  \nseparate supply VIO.  \nThe AD7685 is housed in a 10 -lead MSOP or a 10 -lead LFCSP  \nwith operation specified from −40°C to +85°C.  \n1 Protected by U.S. Patent 6,703,961.  \n \n Rev.

On its leading edge, it initiates the conversions and  \nselects the interface mode of the part, chain, or CS mode. In CS mode, it enables the SDO pin when low.  \nIn chain mode , the data should be read when CNV is high.  \n7 SDO  DO Serial Data Output. The conversion result is output on this pin. It is synchronized to SCK.  \n8 SCK  DI Serial Data Clock Input. When the part is selected, the conversion result is shifted out by this clo ck.  \n9 SDI  DI Serial Data Input. This input provides multiple features. It selects the interface mode of the ADC as follows:  \nChain mode is selected if SDI is low during the CNV rising edge. In this mode, SDI is used as a data input  \nto daisy chain the co nversion results of two or more ADCs onto a single SDO line. The digital data level  \non SDI is output on SDO with a delay of 16 SCK cycles.  \nCS mode is selected if SDI is high during the CNV rising edge. In this mode, either SDI or CN V can enable  \nthe serial output signals when low, and if SDI or CNV is low when the conversion is complete, the BUSY  \nindicator feature is enabled.  \n10 VIO P Input/Output Interface Digital Power.

D | Page 8 of 28  \n Data Sheet  AD7685  \n \nTERMINOLOGY  \nIntegral Nonlinearity Error (INL)  \nINL refers to the deviation of each individual code from a line \ndrawn from negative full scale through positive full scale. The \npoint used as negative full scale occurs ½ LSB before the first \ncode transition. Positive full scale is defined as a level 1 ½ LSB \nbeyond the last code transition. The deviation is measured fro m \nthe middle of each code to the true straight line ( see Figure 26). \nDifferential Nonlinearity Error (DNL)  \nIn an ideal ADC, code transitions are 1 LSB apart. DNL is the \nmaximum deviation from this ideal value. It is  often specified in \nterms of resolution for which no missing codes are guaranteed. \nOffset Error  \nThe first transition should occur at a level ½  LSB above analog \nground (38.1 µV for the 0 V to 5 V range). The offset error is \nthe deviation of the actual trans ition from that point.  \nGain Error  \nThe last transition (from 111 . . . 10 to 111 . . . 11) should  \noccur for an analog voltage 1 ½ LSB below the nominal full  \nscale (4.999886 V for the 0 V to 5 V range). The gain error is the deviation of the actual level of  the last transition from the ideal \nlevel after the offset is  adjusted out.  \nSpurious -Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) \nThe difference, in decibels (dB), between the rms amplitude of \nthe input signal and the peak spurious signal.  Effective Number of Bits (ENOB)  \nENOB is a measurement of the resolution with a sine wave \ninput. It is related to SINAD  by  \nENOB  = (SINAD\ndB − 1.76)/6.02  \nand is expressed in bits.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)  \nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of the first five harmonic \ncomponents to the rms value of a full -scale input signal and is \nexpressed in dB.  \nSignal -to-Noise Ratio (SNR)  \nSNR is the ratio  of the rms value of the actual input signal to the \nrms sum of all other spectral components below the Nyquist \nfrequency, excluding harmonics and dc. The value for SNR is \nexpressed in dB.  \nSignal -to-(Noise + Distortion) , SINAD \nSINAD  is the ratio of the rms value of the actual input signal to \nthe rms sum of all other spectral components below the Nyquist \nfrequency, including harmonics but excluding dc. The value for \nSINAD  is expressed in dB.  \nAperture Delay  \nAperture delay is a measure of the acquisition perfor mance and \nis the time between the rising edge of the CNV input and when the input signal is held for a conversion. \nTransient Response  \nThe time required for the ADC to accurately acquire its input after a full -scale step function i s applied. \n \nRev.

ADC Simplified Schematic  \n \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION  \nThe AD7685 is a fast, low power, single -supply, precise 16 -bit \nADC using a successive approximation architecture.  \nThe AD7685 is capable of converting 250,000 samples per \nsecond (250 kSPS) and powers down between conversions. \nWhen operating at 100 SPS, for  example, it consumes typically \n1.35 µW with a 2.5 V supply, ideal for battery -powered \napplications.  \nThe AD7685 provides the user with on -chip, track -and-hold \nand does not exhibit any pipeline delay or latency, making it ideal for multiple multiplexed channel applications.  \nThe AD7685 is specified from 2.3 V to 5.5 V and can be \ninterfaced to an y 1.8 V to 5 V digital logic family. It is housed in \na 10- lead MSOP or a tiny 10 -lead LFCSP  that combines space \nsavings and allows flexible configurations.  \nIt is pin -for-pin-compatible with the AD76 86, AD7687, and \nAD7688. CONVERTER OPERATION  \nThe AD7685 is a successive appr oximation ADC based on a \ncharge redistribution DAC. Figure 25 shows the simplified \nschematic of the ADC. The capacitive DAC consists of two identical arrays of 16 binary weighted capacitors, which are connected to t he two comparator inputs.  \nDuring the acquisition phase, terminals of the array tied to the \ncomparator’s in put are connected to GND via SW+ and SW−. \nAll independent switches are connected to the analog inputs. \nTherefore , the capacitor arrays are used as sampling capacitors \nand acquire the analog signal on the IN+ and IN− inputs. When the acquisition phase is co mplete and the CNV input goes high, \na conversion phase is initiated. When the conversion phase begins, SW+ and SW− are opened first. The two capacitor arrays are then disconnected from the inputs and connected to the GND input. Therefore, the differential voltage between the inputs IN+ and IN− captured at the end of the acquisition phase \nis applied to the comparator inputs, causing the comparator to \nbecome unbalanced. By switching each element of the capacitor array between GND and REF, the comparator input varies by \nbinary weighted voltage steps (V\nREF/2, V REF/4 . . . V REF/65536). \nThe control logic toggles these switches, starting with the MSB, \nto bring the comparator back into a balanced condition. After \nthe completion of this process, the part powers down and returns to the acquisition phase , and the control logic generates \nthe ADC output code and a BUSY signal indicator.  \nBecause the AD7685 has an on -board conversion clock, the \nserial clock, SCK, is not required for the conversion process.  \nRev.

D | Page 14 of 28  \n Data Sheet  AD7685  \n \nANALOG I NPUTS  \nFigure 28 shows an equivalent circuit of the input structure of \nthe AD7685.  \nThe two diodes, D1 and D2, provide ESD protection for the \nanalog inputs IN+ and IN−. Care must be taken to ensure that \nthe analog input signal never exceeds the supply rails by more \nthan 0.3 V because this will cause these diodes to begin to forward -bias and start conducting current. These diodes can \nhandle a forward -biased cu rrent of 130 mA maximum. For \ninstance, these conditions could eventually occur when the \ninput buffer’s (U1) supplies are different from VDD. In such a \ncase, an input buffer with a short -circuit current limitation can \nbe used to protect the part.  \nCIN RIND1\nD2 CPININ+\nOR IN–\nGNDVDD\n02968-026 \nFigure 28. Equivalent Analog Input Circuit  \nThis analog input structure allows the sampling of the differential signal between IN+ and IN−. By using this differential input, small signals common to both inputs are rejected, as shown in Figure 29, which repres ents the typical \nCMRR over frequency. For instance, by using IN− to sense a remote signal ground, ground potential differences between  \nthe sensor and the local ADC ground are eliminated.  \n02968-027 FREQUENC Y (kHz)10000 1 10 100 1000CMRR (dB)80\n70\n60\n50\n40VDD = 5V\nVDD = 2.5V\n \nFigure 29. Analog Input CMRR vs. Frequency  During the acquisition phase, the impedance of the analog \ninputs (IN+ or IN−) can be modeled as a parallel combination \nof capacitor C PIN and the network formed by the series connection \nof R IN and C IN. C PIN is primarily the pin capacitance. R IN is \ntypica lly 3 kΩ and is a lumped component made up of some \nserial resistors and the on resistance of the switches. C IN is \ntypically 30  pF and is mainly the ADC sampling capacitor. \nDuring the conversion phase, where the switches are opened, the input impedance is l imited to C\nPIN. R IN and C IN make a  \n1-pole, low -pass filter that reduces undesirable aliasing effects \nand limits the noise.  \nWhen the source impedance of the driving circuit is low, the AD7685 can be driven directly. Large source impedances \nsignificantly affect the a c performance, especially THD. The dc \nperformances are less sensitive to the input impedance. The maximum source impedance depends on the amount of THD that can be tolerated. The THD de grades as a function of the \nsource impedance and the maximum input frequency, as shown in Figure 30. \n02968-028 FREQUENC Y (kHz)100 0 25 50 75THD (dB)–60\n–70\n–80\n–90\n–100\n–110\n–120RS = 33ΩRS = 50ΩRS = 100ΩRS = 250Ω\n \nFigure 30.

D | Page 15 of 28 \nAD7685   Data Sheet  \n \nDRIVER AMPLIFIER CHO ICE \nAlthough the AD7685 is easy to drive, the driver amplifier \nneeds to meet the following requirements:  \n• The noise generated by the driver amplifier needs to be kept \nas low as possible to preserve the SNR and transition noise performance of the AD7685. Note that the AD7685 has a \nnoise much lower than most of the other 16 -bit ADCs  and, \ntherefore, can be driven by a noisier amplifier to meet a given \nsystem noise specification. The noise coming from the \namplifier is filtered by the AD7685 analog input circuit low -\npass filte r made by R\nIN and C IN or by an external filter, if one \nis used. Because the typical noise of the AD7685 is 35 µV rms, \nthe SNR degradation due to the amplifier is  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n+=\n−2\n3dB2) ( f2π353520log\nNLOSS\nNeSNR  \nwhere:  \nf–3dB is the input bandwidth in MHz of the AD7685 \n(2 MHz) or the cutoff frequency of the input filter, if one is \nused.  \nN is the noise gain of the amplifier ( for example, 1 in buffer \nconfiguration).  \neN  is the equivalent input noise voltage of the op amp, in \nnV/√Hz.  \n• For ac applications, the driver should have a THD performance commensurate with the AD7685. Figure 17 \nshows the AD7685s THD vs. frequency.  \n• For multichannel, multiplexed applications, the driver amplifier and the AD7685 analog input circuit must settle a \nfull-scale step onto the capacitor array at a 16 -bit level \n(0.0015%). In the amplifier’s data sheet, settling at 0.1% to 0.01% is more commonly specified. This could differ \nsignificantly from the settling time at a 16 -bit level and \nshould be verified prior to driver selection.  \nTable 9.

For ins tance, a 22 µF (X5R,  \n1206 size) ceramic chip capacitor is appropriate for optimum \nperformance using a low temperature drift ADR43x  reference.  \nIf desired, smaller reference decoupling capacitor valu es down \nto 2.2 µF can be used with a minimal impact on performance, \nespecially DNL.  \nPOWER SUPPLY \nThe AD7685 is specified over a wide operating range from 2.3  V \nto 5.5 V . It has, unlike other low voltage converters, a noise low \nenough to design a 16 -bit resolution system with low supply \nand respectable performance. It uses two power supply pins: a \ncore supply VDD and a digital input/output interface supply VIO. VIO allows direct interface with any logic between 1.8 V and VDD. To reduce the number of supplies needed, the VIO and VDD can be tied together. The AD7685 is independent of \npower supply sequencing between VIO and VDD. Additionally, it is very insensitive to power supply variations over a wide \nfrequency range, as shown in Figure 31, which represents PSRR \nover frequency.  \n02968-029 FREQUENC Y (kHz)10000 1 10 100 1000PSRR (dB)110\n8090100\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30VDD = 5V\nVDD = 2.5V\n \nFigure 31.

Example of Application Circuit  DIGITAL INTERFACE  \nThough the AD7685 has a reduced number of pins, it offers \nsubstantial flexibility in its serial interface modes.  \nThe AD7685, when in CS mode, is compatible wit h SPI, QSPI, \ndigital hosts, and DSPs, for example , Blackfin® ADSP -BF53x  or \nADSP -219x . This interface can use either 3 -wire or 4 -wire. A  \n3-wire interface using the CNV , SCK, and SDO signals minimizes \nwiring connections, useful, for instance, in isolated applications. A 4-wire interface using the SDI, CNV , SCK, and SDO signals \nallows CNV , which initiates the conversions, to be indepe ndent \nof the readback timing (SDI). This is useful in low jitter sampling or simultaneous sampling applications.  \nThe AD7685, when in chain mode, provides a daisy -chain \nfeature using the SDI input  for cascading multiple ADCs on a \nsingle data line similar to a shift register. \nThe mode in which the part operates depends on the SDI level \nwhen the CNV rising edge occurs. The \nCS mode is selected if \nSDI is high and the chain mode is selected if SDI is low. The \nSDI hold time is such that when SDI and CNV are connected \ntogether, the chain mode is always selected.  \nIn either the CS mode or the chain mode, the AD7685 offers the \nflexibility to optionally force a start bit in front of the data bits. \nThis start bit can be used as a BUSY signal indicator to \ninterrupt the digital host and trigger the data reading. Otherwise, without a BUSY indicator, the user m ust time out \nthe maximum conversion time prior to readback.  \nThe BUSY indicator feature is enabled as follows:  \n• In the \nCS mode, if CNV or SDI is low when the ADC \nconversion ends ( see Figure 37 and Figure 41). \n• In the chain mode, if SCK is high during the CNV rising edge (see Figure 45). \n \n \nRev.

This feature is useful for reducing \ncomponent count and wiring connections, for example , in \nisola ted multiconverter applications or for systems with a \nlimited interfacing capacity. Data readback is analogous to \nclocking a shift register. \nA connection diagram example using two AD7685s is show n in \nFigure 42, and the corresponding timing is given in Figure 43. \nWhen SDI and CNV are low, SDO is driven low. With SCK low, \na rising edge on CNV initiates a conversion and  selects the \nchain mode. In this mode, CNV is held high during the \nconversion phase and the subsequent data readback. When the \nconversion is complete, the MSB is output onto SDO and the AD7685 enters the acquisition phase and powers down. The \nremaining data bits stored in the internal shift register are then clocked by subsequent SCK falling edges. For each ADC, SDI feeds the input of the internal shift register and is clocked by the SCK falling e dge. Each ADC in the chain outputs its data MSB \nfirst, and 16 × N clocks are required to readback the N ADCs. The data is valid on both SCK edges. Although the rising edge \ncan be used to capture the data, a digital host using the SCK \nfalling edge will allo w a faster reading rate and, consequently , \nmore AD7685s in the chain, provided the digital host has an \nacceptable hold time.

This \nfeature is useful for reducing component count and wiring \nconnections, for example , in isolated multiconverter applications  or \nfor systems with a limited interfacing c apacity. Data readback is \nanalogous to clocking a shift register.  \nA connection diagram example using three AD7685s is shown in Figure 44, and the correspo nding timing is given in Figure 45. \nWhen SDI and CNV are low, SDO is driven low. With SCK high, a rising edge on CNV initiates a conversion, selects the chain mode, and enables the BUSY indicator feature. In this \nmode, CNV is held high during the conversion phase and the \nsubsequent data readback. When all ADCs in the chain have \ncompleted their conversions, the near -end ADC (ADC C in Figure 44) SDO is driven high. This transiti on on SDO can be \nused as a BUSY indicator to trigger the data readback controlled by the digital host. The AD7685 then enters the acquisition \nphase and powers down.

T he pinout of the \nAD7685 with all its analog signals on the left side and all its \ndigital signals on the right side eases this task.  \nAvoid running digital lines under the device because these \ncouple noise onto the die, unless a ground plane under the \nAD7685 is used as a shield. Fast switching signals, such as CNV \nor clocks, should never run near analog signal paths. Crossover \nof digital and analog signals should be avoided . \nAt least one ground plane should be used. It could be common \nor split between the digital and analog section. In the latter case, the planes should be joined underneath the AD7685.  \nThe AD7685 voltage reference input REF has a dynamic input \nimpedance and should be decoupled with minimal parasitic inductances. This is done by placing the reference deco upling \nceramic capacitor close to, and ideally right up against, the REF and GND pins and connected with wide, low impedance traces.  \nFinally, the power supplies VDD and VIO should be decoupled \nwith ceramic capacitors, typically 100 nF, placed close to the \nAD7685 and connected using short and wide traces to provide \nlow impedance paths and to reduce the effect of glit ches on the \npower supply lines.  \nAn example layout following these rules is shown in  Figure 46 \nand Figure 47. \nEVALUATING THE PERFO RMANCE  OF THE AD7685  \nOther recommended layouts for the AD7685 are outlined in the \ndocumentation of the EVA L -AD7685SDZ  evaluation board. \nThe EVA L -AD7685SDZ  evaluation board package includes a \nfully assembled and tested evaluation board, documentation, \nand software for controlling the board from a PC via the EVA L -\nSDP-CB1Z . \n02968-044 \nFigure 46.

Multiple AD7685s are daisy -chained to reduce the number of \nsignals to isolate. Note that the SCKOUT, which is a readback of \nthe AD7685s clock, has a very short skew with the DATA signal. \nThis skew is the channel -to-channel matching propagation \ndelay of the digital isolator (t PSKCD ). This allows running the \nserial interface at the maximum speed of the digital isolator (45 Mbps for the ADuM1402C ), which would have been \notherwise limited by the cascade of the propagation delays of the digital isolator.  \nThe complete analog chain runs on a 5 V single supply using the ADR39 1 low dropout reference voltage and the rail -to-rail \nCMOS AD8618 amplifier while offering true bipolar input range.  \n \nIN– GNDREF VDD VIOSDOVDD1, VE1\nGND 1VDD2, VE2\nGND 2\nSCK\nCNV\nSDIAD7685\n1/4AD86185V1kΩ\n2V REF±10V INPUT5V REF 5V\n5V10µF 100nF\n100nF\nIN– GNDREF VDD VIOSDO\nSCK\nCNV\nSDIAD7685\n1/4AD86185V1kΩ\n2V REF±10V INPUT5V REF 5V\n10µF 100nF\nIN– GNDREF VDD VIOSDO\nSCK\nCNV\nSDIAD7685\n1/4AD86185V1kΩ\n2V REF±10V INPUT5V REF 5V\n10µF 100nF\nIN–IN+IN+IN+IN+\nGNDREF VDD VIOSDO\nSCK\nCNV\nSDIAD7685\n1/4AD86185V1kΩ 4kΩ4kΩ4kΩ4kΩ\n2V REF5V\n5V1kΩ 1kΩ\n1kΩ\n100nF 10µF5V REF\n2V REF\n4kΩ±10V INPUT5V REF 5V\n10µF 100nFVIA\nVIB\nVOC\nVODVOA\nVOB\nVIC\nVID2.7V TO 5V\n100nF\nDATA\nSCKOUT\nSCKIN\nCONVERT\nADuM1402C\nOUT\nGNDINADR391\n02968-046 \nFigure 48.
