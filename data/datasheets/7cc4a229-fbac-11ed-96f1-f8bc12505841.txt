Within the risk grouping system of this IEC standard, the device specified in this \ndata sheet falls into the class exempt group (exposure time 10000 s) . Under real circumstances (for expo -\nsure time, conditions of the eye pupils, observation distance), it is assumed that no endangerment to the eye exists from these devices. As a matter of principle, however, it should be mentioned that intense light \nsources have a high secondary exposure potential due to their blinding effect. When looking at bright light sources (e.g. headlights), temporary reduction in visual acuity and afterimages can occur, leading to irrita -\ntion, annoyance, visual impairment, and even accidents, depending on the situation.\nSubcomponents of this device contain, in addition to other substances, metal filled materials including silver. \nMetal filled materials can be affected by environments that contain traces of aggressive substances. There -\nfore, we recommend that customers minimize device exposure to aggressive substances during storage, \nproduction, and use. Devices that showed visible discoloration when tested using the described tests above \ndid show no performance deviations within failure limits during the stated test duration.
