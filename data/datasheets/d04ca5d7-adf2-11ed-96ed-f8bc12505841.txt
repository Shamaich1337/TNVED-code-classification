An internal comparator in the TPS73xx monitors the output voltage of the regulatorto detect an undervoltage condition on the regulated output voltage.\nIf that occurs, the RESET\n output (open-drain NMOS) turns on, taking the RESET  signal low. RESET  stays low\nfor the duration of the undervoltage condition. Once the undervoltage condition ceases, a 200-ms (typ) time-outbegins. At the completion of the 200-ms delay, RESET\n goes high.\nAn order of magnitude reduction in dropout voltage and quiescent current over conventional LDO performance\nis achieved by replacing the typical pnp pass transistor with a PMOS device.\nBecause the PMOS device behaves as a low-value resistor, the dropout voltage is very low (maximum of 35mV\nat an output current of 100 mA for the TPS7350) and is directly proportional to the output current (see Figure 1).Additionally, since the PMOS pass element is a voltage-driven device, the quiescent current is low and remainsconstant, independent of output loading (typically 340 mA over the full range of output current, 0 mA to 500mA).\nThese two key specifications yield a significant improvement in operating life for battery-powered systems.\nThe LDO family also features a sleep mode; applying a logic high signal to EN\n (enable) shuts down the regulator,\nreducing the quiescent current to 0.5 mA maximum at T J = 25°C.\nThe TPS73xx is offered in 2.5-V, 3-V, 3.3-V, 4.85-V, and 5-V fixed-voltage versions and in an adjustable version\n(programmable over the range of 1.2 V to 9.75 V). Output voltage tolerance is specified as a maximum of 2%over line, load, and temperature ranges (3% for the 2.5 V and the adjustable version). The TPS73xx family isavailable in PDIP (8 pin), SO (8 pin) and TSSOP (20 pin) packages. The TSSOP has a maximum height of1.2mm.\nFigure 1.

system-miniaturization trends, integrated circuits are being offered in low-profile and fine-pitch\nsurface-mount packages. Implementation of many of today’s high-performance devices in these packages requiresspecial attention to power dissipation. Many  system-dependent issues such as thermal coupling, airflow, added heatsinks and convection surfaces, and the presence of other heat-generating components affect the power-dissipationlimits of a given component.\nThree basic approaches for enhancing thermal performance are illustrated in this discussion:\n/C0068Improving the power-dissipation capability of the PWB design\n/C0068Improving the thermal coupling of the component to the PWB\n/C0068Introducing airflow in the system\nFigure 44 is an example of a thermally enhanced PWB layout for the 20-lead TSSOP package. This layout involves\nadding copper on the PWB to conduct heat away from the device. The R qJA (thermal resistance, junction-to-ambient)\nfor this component/board system is illustrated in Figure 45. The family of curves illustrates the effect of increasingthe size of the copper-heat-sink surface area. The PWB is a standard FR4 board (L × W × H = 3.2 inch × 3.2 inch\n× 0.062 inch); the board traces and heat sink area are 1-oz (per square foot) copper.\nFigure 46 shows the thermal resistance for the same system with the addition of a thermally-conductive compound\nbetween the body of the TSSOP package and the PWB copper routed directly beneath the device. The thermalconductivity for the compound used in this analysis is 0.815 W/m × °C.\nUsing these figures to determine the system R\nqJA allows the maximum power-dissipation limit to be calculated with\nthe equation:\nPD(max)/C0043TJ(max)/C0042TA\nR/C0113JA(system)\nWhere\nTJ(max) is the maximum allowable junction temperature; 150 °C absolute maximum and 125 °C\nmaximum recommended operating temperature for specified operation.\nThis limit should then be applied to the internal power dissipated by the TPS73xx regulator. The equation for\ncalculating total internal power dissipation of the TPS73xx is:\nPD(total)/C0043/C0466VI/C0042VO/C0467/C0032IO/C0041VI/C0032IQ\nBecause the quiescent current of the TPS73xx family is very low, the second term is negligible, further simplifying\nthe equation to:\nPD(total)/C0043/C0466VI/C0042VO/C0467/C0032IO\nFor a 20-lead TSSOP/FR4 board system with thermally conductive compound between the board and the device\nbody, where T A = 55°C, airflow = 100 ft/min, and copper heat sink area = 1 cm 2, the maximum power-dissipation limit\ncan be calculated. As indicated in Figure 46, the system R qJA is 94°C/W; therefore, the maximum power-dissipation\nlimit is:\nPD(max)/C0043TJ(max)/C0042TA\nR/C0113JA(system)/C0043125 C /C004255 C\n94 C/C0324W/C0043745 mW°°°\nIf the system implements a TPS7348 regulator where V I = 6 V and I O = 150 mA, the internal power dissipation is:\nPD(total)/C0043/C0466VI/C0042VO/C0467/C0032IO/C0043(6/C00424.85) /C00320.150 /C0043173 mW\nTPS7301Q, TPS7325Q, TPS7330Q, TPS7333Q, TPS7348Q, TPS7350Q\nLOW-DROPOUT VOLTAGE REGULATORS\nWITH INTEGRATED DELAYED RESET FUNCTION \nSLVS124F – JUNE 1995 – REVISED JANUARY 1999\n34 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265THERMAL INFORMATION\nComparing P D(total) with PD(max) reveals that the power dissipation in this example does not exceed the maximum\nlimit. When it does, one of two corrective actions can be taken. The power-dissipation limit can be raised by increasingeither the airflow or the heat-sink area. Alternatively, the internal power dissipation of the regulator can be loweredby reducing either the input voltage or the load current. In either case, the above calculations should be repeated withthe new system parameters.\nCopper Heat Sink\n1 oz Cu\nFigure 44.

TheTPS73xx family includes five fixed-output voltage regulators: the TPS7325 (2.5 V), TPS7330 (3 V), TPS7333(3.3 V), the TPS7348 (4.85 V), and the TPS7350 (5 V). The family also offers an adjustable device, the TPS7301(adjustable from 1.2 V to 9.75 V).\ndevice operation\nThe TPS73xx, unlike many other LDOs, features very low quiescent currents that remain virtually constant evenwith varying loads. Conventional  LDO regulators use a pnp-pass element, the base current of which is directlyproportional to the load current through the regulator (I\nB = IC/b). Close examination of the data sheets reveals\nthat such devices are typically specified under near no-load conditions; actual operating currents are muchhigher as evidenced by typical quiescent current versus load current curves (see Figure 7). The TPS73xx usesa PMOS transistor to pass current; because the gate of the PMOS element is voltage driven, operating currentsare low and invariable over the full load range. The TPS73xx specifications reflect actual performance underload.\nAnother pitfall associated with the pnp-pass element is its tendency to saturate when the device goes into\ndropout. The resulting drop in b forces an increase in I\nB to maintain the load. During power-up, this translates\nto large start-up currents. Systems with limited supply current may fail to start up. In battery-powered systems,it means rapid battery discharge when the voltage decays below the minimum required for regulation. TheTPS73xx quiescent current remains low even when the regulator drops out, thus eliminating both problems.\nIncluded in the TPS73xx family is a 4.85-V regulator, the TPS7348. Designed specifically for 5-V cellular\nsystems, its 4.85-V output, regulated to within ± 2%, allows for operation within the low-end limit of 5-V systems\nspecified to ± 5% tolerance; therefore, maximum regulated operating lifetime is obtained from a battery pack\nbefore the device drops out, adding crucial talk minutes between charges.\nThe TPS73xx family also features a shutdown mode that places the output in the high-impedance state\n(essentially equal to the feedback-divider resistance) and reduces quiescent current to under 0.5 mA. When the\nshutdown feature is not used, EN\n should be tied to ground. Response to an enable transition is quick; regulated\noutput voltage is reestablished in typically 120 ms.\nminimum load requirements\nThe TPS73xx family is stable even at zero load; no minimum load is required for operation.\nSENSE connection\nThe SENSE terminal of fixed-output devices must be connected to the regulator output for proper functioning\nof the regulator. Normally, this connection should be as short as possible; however, the connection can be madenear a critical circuit (remote sense) to improve performance at that point. Internally, SENSE connects to ahigh-impedance wide-bandwidth amplifier through a resistor-divider network, and noise pickup feeds throughto the regulator output. It is essential to route the SENSE connection in such a way as to minimize/avoid noisepickup. Adding an RC network between SENSE and OUT to filter noise is not recommended because it cancause the regulator to oscillate.\nexternal capacitor requirements\nAn input capacitor is not required; however, a ceramic bypass capacitor (0.047 pF to 0.1 mF) improves load\ntransient response and noise rejection when the TPS73xx is located more than a few inches from the powersupply. A higher-capacitance electrolytic capacitor may be necessary if large (hundreds of milliamps) loadtransients with fast rise times are anticipated.\nTPS7301Q, TPS7325Q, TPS7330Q, TPS7333Q, TPS7348Q, TPS7350Q\nLOW-DROPOUT VOLTAGE REGULATORS\nWITH INTEGRATED DELAYED RESET FUNCTION \nSLVS124F – JUNE 1995 – REVISED JANUARY 1999\n36 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265APPLICATION INFORMATION\nexternal capacitor requirements (continued)\nAs with most LDO regulators, the TPS73xx family requires an output capacitor for stability. A low-ESR 10- mF\nsolid-tantalum capacitor connected from the regulator output to ground is sufficient to ensure stability over thefull load range (see Figure 42). Adding high-frequency ceramic or film capacitors (such as power-supply bypasscapacitors for digital or analog ICs) can cause the regulator to become unstable unless the ESR of the tantalumcapacitor is less than 1.2 W over temperature. Capacitors with published ESR specifications such as the\nAVX TPSD106M035R0300 and the Sprague 593D106X0035D2W work well because the maximum ESR at25°C is 300 m W (typically, the ESR in solid-tantalum capacitors increases by a factor of 2 or less when the\ntemperature drops from 25 °C to –40 °C). Where component height and/or mounting area is a problem,\nphysically smaller, 10- mF devices can be screened for ESR. Figures 29 through 32 show the stable regions of\noperation using different values of output capacitance with various values of ceramic load capacitance.\nIn applications with little or no high-frequency bypass capacitance (< 0.2 mF), the output capacitance can be\nreduced to 4.7 mF, provided ESR is maintained between 0.7 and 2.5 W. Because capacitor minimum ESR is\nseldom if ever specified, it may be necessary to add a 0.5- W to 1-W resistor in series with the capacitor and limit\nESR to 1.5 W maximum. As shown in the CSR graphs (Figures 29 through 32), minimum ESR is not a problem\nwhen using 10- mF or larger output capacitors.\nBelow is a partial listing of surface-mount capacitors usable with the TPS73xx family. This information, along\nwith the CSR graphs, is included to assist in selection of suitable capacitance for the user’s application. Whennecessary to achieve low height requirements along with high output current and/or high ceramic loadcapacitance, several higher ESR capacitors can be used in parallel to meet the guidelines above.\nAll load and temperature conditions with up to 1 mF of added ceramic load capacitance:\nPART NO.

TPS7301 Adjustable LDO Regulator Programming\nundervoltage supervisor function\nThe RESET  output of the TPS73xx initiates a reset in microcomputer and microprocessor systems in the event\nof an undervoltage condition. An internal comparator in the TPS73xx monitors the output voltage of the regulatorto detect the undervoltage condition. When that occurs, the RESET\n output transistor turns on taking the RESET\nsignal low.\nOn power up, the output voltage tracks the input voltage. The RESET  output becomes active (low) as V I\napproaches the minimum required for a valid RESET  signal (specified at 1.5 V for 25 °C and 1.9 V over full\nrecommended operating temperature range). When the output voltage reaches the appropriate positive-goinginput threshold (V\nIT+), a 200-ms (typical) timeout period begins during which the RESET  output remains low.\nOnce the timeout has expired, the RESET  output becomes inactive. Since the RESET  output is an open-drain\nNMOS, a pullup resistor should be used to ensure that a logic-high signal is indicated.\nThe supply-voltage-supervisor function is also activated during power-down. As the input voltage decays and\nafter the dropout voltage is reached, the output voltage tracks linearly with the decaying input voltage. Whenthe output voltage drops below the specified negative-going input threshold (V\nIT– — see electrical\ncharacteristics tables), the RESET  output becomes active (low). It is important to note that if the input voltage\ndecays below the minimum required for a valid RESET , the RESET  is undefined.\nSince the circuit is monitoring the regulator output voltage, the RESET  output can also be triggered by disabling\nthe regulator or by any fault condition that causes the output to drop below V IT–. Examples of fault conditions\ninclude a short circuit on the output and a low input voltage. Once the output voltage is reestablished, either byreenabling the regulator or removing the fault condition, then the internal timer is initiated, which holds theRESET\n signal active during the 200-ms (typical) timeout period.\nTPS7301Q, TPS7325Q, TPS7330Q, TPS7333Q, TPS7348Q, TPS7350Q\nLOW-DROPOUT VOLTAGE REGULATORS\nWITH INTEGRATED DELAYED RESET FUNCTION \nSLVS124F – JUNE 1995 – REVISED JANUARY 1999\n39 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265APPLICATION INFORMATION\nundervoltage supervisor function (continued)\nTransient loads or line pulses can also cause a reset to occur if proper care is not taken in selecting the input\nand output capacitors. Load transients that are faster than 5 ms can cause a reset if high-ESR output capacitors\n(greater than approximately 7 W) are used. A 1- ms transient causes a reset when using an output capacitor with\ngreater than 3.5 W of ESR. Note that the output-voltage spike during the transient can drop well below the reset\nthreshold and still not trip if the transient duration is short. A 1- ms transient must drop at least 500 mV below the\nthreshold before tripping the reset circuit. A 2- ms transient trips RESET  at just 400 mV below the threshold.\nLower-ESR output capacitors help by reducing the drop in output voltage during a transient and should be usedwhen fast transients are expected.\nNOTE:\nVIT+ = VIT– +Hysteresis\noutput noise\nThe TPS73xx has very low output noise, with a spectral noise density < 2 mV/√Hz. This is important when\nnoise-susceptible systems, such as audio amplifiers, are powered by the regulator.\nregulator protection\nThe TPS73xx PMOS-pass transistor has a built-in back diode that safely conducts reverse currents when theinput voltage drops below the output voltage (e.g., during power down). Current is conducted from the outputto the input and is not internally limited. If extended reverse voltage is anticipated, external limiting might beappropriate.\nThe TPS73xx also features internal current limiting and thermal protection. During normal operation, the\nTPS73xx limits output current to approximately 1 A. When current limiting engages, the output voltage scalesback linearly until the overcurrent condition ends. While current limiting is designed to prevent gross devicefailure, care should be taken not to exceed the power dissipation ratings of the package. If the temperature ofthe device exceeds 165 °C, thermal-protection circuitry shuts it down. Once the device has cooled, regulator\noperation resumes.\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 10-Dec-2022\nPACKAGING INFORMATION\nOrderable Device Status\n(1)Package Type Package\nDrawingPinsPackage\nQtyEco Plan\n(2)Lead finish/\nBall material\n(6)MSL Peak Temp\n(3)Op Temp (°C) Device Marking\n(4/5)Samples\nTPS7301QD LIFEBUY SOIC D875RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7301Q\nTPS7301QDG4 LIFEBUY SOIC D875RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7301Q\nTPS7301QDR ACTIVE SOIC D82500RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7301QSamples\nTPS7301QP ACTIVE PDIP P850RoHS & Green NIPDAU N / A for Pkg Type -40 to 125 TPS7301QPSamples\nTPS7301QPW ACTIVE TSSOP PW2070RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PT7301Samples\nTPS7325QD ACTIVE SOIC D875RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 85 7325QSamples\nTPS7325QP ACTIVE PDIP P850RoHS & Green NIPDAU N / A for Pkg Type -40 to 85 TPS7325QPSamples\nTPS7325QPWR ACTIVE TSSOP PW202000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 85 PT7325Samples\nTPS7330QD ACTIVE SOIC D875RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7330QSamples\nTPS7330QDR ACTIVE SOIC D82500RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7330QSamples\nTPS7330QP ACTIVE PDIP P850RoHS & Green NIPDAU N / A for Pkg Type -40 to 125 TPS7330QPSamples\nTPS7333QD ACTIVE SOIC D875RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7333QSamples\nTPS7333QDG4 ACTIVE SOIC D875RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7333QSamples\nTPS7333QDR ACTIVE SOIC D82500RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7333QSamples\nTPS7333QDRG4 ACTIVE SOIC D82500RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7333QSamples\nTPS7333QP ACTIVE PDIP P850RoHS & Green NIPDAU N / A for Pkg Type -40 to 125 TPS7333QPSamples\nTPS7333QPW ACTIVE TSSOP PW2070RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PT7333Samples\nTPS7333QPWR ACTIVE TSSOP PW202000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PT7333Samples\nTPS7348QDR ACTIVE SOIC D82500RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7348QSamples\nTPS7350QD LIFEBUY SOIC D875RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7350Q\nTPS7350QDR ACTIVE SOIC D82500RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 7350QSamples\nAddendum-Page 1\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 10-Dec-2022\nOrderable Device Status\n(1)Package Type Package\nDrawingPinsPackage\nQtyEco Plan\n(2)Lead finish/\nBall material\n(6)MSL Peak Temp\n(3)Op Temp (°C) Device Marking\n(4/5)Samples\nTPS7350QP ACTIVE PDIP P850RoHS & Green NIPDAU N / A for Pkg Type -40 to 125 TPS7350QPSamples\nTPS7350QPWR LIFEBUY TSSOP PW202000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-1-260C-UNLIM -40 to 125 PT7350\n \n(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:\nACTIVE: Product device recommended for new designs.\nLIFEBUY:  TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.\nNRND: Not recommended for new designs.
