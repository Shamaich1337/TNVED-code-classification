All transmitter outputs and receiverinputs are protected to ±15kV using IEC 1000-4-2 Air-Gap Discharge, to ±8kV using IEC 1000-4-2 ContactDischarge, and to ±15kV using the Human Body Model.\nThe MAX3221E/MAX3223E/MAX3243E achieve a\n1µA supply current with Maxim’s revolutionaryAutoShutdown™ feature. They save power withoutchanges to the existing BIOS or operating system by enter-ing low-power shutdown mode when the RS-232 cable isdisconnected, or when the transmitters of the connectedperipherals are off.\nThe transceivers have a proprietary low-dropout trans-\nmitter output stage, delivering true RS-232 performancefrom a +3.0V to +5.5V supply with a dual charge pump.The charge pump requires only four small 0.1µF capaci-tors for operation from a +3.3V supply. Each device isguaranteed to run at data rates of 250kbps while main-taining RS-232 output levels.\nThe MAX3221E contains just one driver and one receiver,\nmaking it the smallest single-supply RS-232 transceiver.The MAX3223E has two drivers and two receivers. TheMAX3243E is a complete 3-driver/5-receiver serial portideal for notebook or subnotebook computers. It alsoincludes two noninverting receiver outputs that are alwaysactive, allowing external devices to be monitored withoutforward biasing the protection diodes in circuitry that maybe powered down.\nThe MAX3221E, MAX3223E, and MAX3243E are avail-\nable in space-saving TQFN, SSOP, and TSSOP pack-ages.\nApplications\nNotebook, Subnotebook, and Palmtop Computers\nCellular PhonesBattery-Powered EquipmentHandheld EquipmentPeripheralsPrintersNext Generation Device Features\noFor Space-Constrained Applications:\nMAX3228E/MAX3229E: ±15kV ESD-Protected, +2.5Vto +5.5V RS-232 Transceivers in UCSP™MAX3222E/MAX3232E/MAX3237E/MAX3241E/MAX3246E: ±15kV ESD-Protected Down to 10nA,+3.0V to +5.5V, Up to 1Mbps, True RS-232Transceivers (MAX3246E Available in a UCSPPackage)\noFor Data Cable Applications:MAX3380E/MAX3381E: +2.35V to +5.5V, 1µA,2Tx/2Rx RS-232 Transceivers with ±15kV ESD-Protected I/O and Logic Pins±15kV ESD-Protected, 1µA, 3.0V to 5.5V, 250kbps,\nRS-232 Transceivers with AutoShutdown\nAutoShutdown and UCSP are trademarks of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.\n†Covered by U.S. Patent numbers 4,636,930; 4,679,134; 4,777,577; 4,797,899; 4,809,152; 4,897,774; 4,999,761; 5,649,210; and other patents pending.Pin Configurations appear at end of data sheet.\nTypical Operating Circuits appear at end of data sheet.*Exposed pad.\n+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\n/V denotes an automotive qualified part.\nOrdering Information continued at end of data sheet.Ordering Information\nSelector Guide\nPARTNO.

The charge pumps operate\nin discontinuous mode: if the output voltages are lessthan 5.5V, the charge pumps are enabled; if the outputvoltages exceed 5.5V, the charge pumps are disabled.Each charge pump requires a flying capacitor (C1, C2)and a reservoir capacitor (C3, C4) to generate the V+and V- supplies.\nRS-232 Transmitters\nThe transmitters are inverting level translators that con-vert CMOS-logic levels to 5.0V EIA/TIA-232 levels. Theyguarantee a 250kbps data rate with worst-case loadsof 3kΩ in parallel with 1000pF, providing compatibility\nwith PC-to-PC communication software such asLapLink™. Transmitters can be paralleled to drive mul-tiple receivers. The MAX3243E has been specificallydesigned to drive serial mice. Figure 1 shows a com-plete system connection. When FORCEOFF is driven to\nground, or the AutoShutdown circuitry senses invalidvoltage levels on all receiver inputs, the transmitters aredisabled and the outputs are forced into a high-imped-ance state. When powered off or shut down, the outputcan be driven up to ±12V. The transmitter inputs do nothave pull-up resistors.Pin Description (continued)\nPIN \nMAX3221E MAX3223E MAX3243E \nTQFN-\nEP SSOP/ \nTSSOP TQFN-\nEP DIP/ \nSSOP/ \nTSSOP SO/ \nSSOP/ \nTSSOP TQFN-\nEP NAME FUNCTION\n— — — — — 19, 20 R_OUTB Noninverting Complementary Receiver Outputs. \nAlways active. \n— — — — — 9, 16, \n25, 32 N.C.

Allreceivers have inverting three-state outputs and can beactive or inactive. In shutdown (FORCEOFF = low) or in\nAutoShutdown, the MAX3221E/MAX3223E’s receiversare active (Table 1). Drive EN high to place the receiv-\ner(s) in a high-impedance state. The MAX3243E’sreceivers are high-impedance when the part is in shut-down (FORCEOFF = low).\nThe MAX3243E features an extra, always-active com-\nplementary output (R2OUTB). R2OUTB monitorsreceiver activity while the other receivers are high-impedance. This allows Ring Indicator to be monitoredwithout forward biasing other devices connected to thereceiver outputs. This is ideal for systems where V\nCC\ndrops to 0 in shutdown to accommodate peripheralssuch as UARTs (Figure 2).\nThe MAX3221E/MAX3223E/MAX3243E feature an\nINVALID output that is enabled low when no valid RS-232\nsignal levels have been detected on all receiver inputs.INVALID is functional in any mode (Figures 3 and 5).\nAutoShutdown\nThe MAX3221E/MAX3223E/MAX3243E achieve a 1µAsupply current with Maxim’s new AutoShutdown fea-ture, which operates when FORCEON is low andFORCEOFF is high. When these devices sense no valid\nsignal levels on all receiver inputs for 30µs, the on-board charge pump and drivers are shut off, reducingsupply current to 1µA. This occurs if the RS-232 cable is disconnected or the connected peripheral transmit-ters are turned off. The device turns on again when a valid level is applied to any RS-232 receiver input. As aresult, the system saves power without changes to theexisting BIOS or operating system. Table 2 and Figure 3c summarize the MAX3221E/MAX3223E/MAX3243E operating modes. FORCEONand FORCEOFF override AutoShutdown. When neither\ncontrol is asserted, the IC selects between these statesautomatically, based on receiver input levels. Figures3a, 3b, and 5a depict valid and invalid RS-232 receiverlevels.

If the other systemtransmits valid RS-232 signals within that time, the RS-232 ports on both systems remain enabled.\nWhen shut down, the device’s charge pumps are off,\nV+ is pulled to V\nCC, V- is pulled to ground, and the\ntransmitter outputs are high impedance. The timerequired to exit shutdown is typically 100µs (Figure 5b).\nSoftware-Controlled Shutdown\nIf direct software control is desired, INVALID can be\nused to indicate DTR or Ring Indicator signal. Connect\nFORCEOFF and FORCEON together to disable Auto-\nShutdown so the line acts like a SHDN input.±15kV ESD Protection\nAs with all Maxim devices, ESD-protection structures areincorporated on all pins to protect against electrostaticdischarges encountered during handling and assembly.The driver outputs and receiver inputs of theMAX3221E/MAX3223E/MAX3243E have extra protectionagainst static electricity. Maxim’s engineers have devel-oped state-of-the-art structures to protect these pinsagainst ESD of ±15kV without damage. The ESD struc-tures withstand high ESD in all states: normal operation,shutdown, and powered down. After an ESD event,Maxim’s E versions keep working without latchup,whereas competing RS-232 products can latch andmust be powered down to remove latchup.

Hence, the ESD with-stand voltage measured to IEC1000-4-2 is generallylower than that measured using the Human BodyModel. Figure 7a shows the IEEE1000-4-2 model andFigure 7b shows the current waveform for the ±8kVIEC1000-4-2 Level 4 ESD contact-discharge test.\nThe air-gap test involves approaching the device with a\ncharged probe. The contact-discharge method connectsthe probe to the device before the probe is energized.\nMachine Model \nThe Machine Model for ESD tests all pins using a 200pFstorage capacitor and zero discharge resistance. Itsobjective is to emulate the stress caused by contact thatoccurs with handling and assembly during manufactur-ing. Of course, all pins require this protection duringmanufacturing, not just RS-232 inputs and outputs.Therefore, after PC board assembly, the Machine Modelis less relevant to I/O ports.\n___________Applications Information\nCapacitor Selection\nThe capacitor type used for C1–C4 is not critical forproper operation; either polarized or nonpolarizedcapacitors may be used. The charge pump requires0.1µF capacitors for 3.3V operation. For other supplyvoltages, refer to Table 3 for required capacitor values.Do not use values smaller than those listed in Table 3.Increasing the capacitor values (e.g., by a factor of 2)reduces ripple on the transmitter outputs and slightlyreduces power consumption. C2, C3, and C4 can beincreased without changing C1’s value. However, do\nnot increase C1 without also increasing the values ofC2, C3, and C4 to maintain the proper ratios (C1 tothe other capacitors).CHARGE-CURRENT\nLIMIT RESISTORDISCHARGE\nRESISTANCE\nSTORAGE\nCAPACITORCs\n100pFRC 1MΩ RD 1500Ω\nHIGH-\nVOLTAGE\nDC\nSOURCEDEVICE\nUNDER\nTESTCHARGE CURRENT\nLIMIT RESISTORDISCHARGE\nRESISTANCE\nSTORAGECAPACITORCs\n150pFR\nC 50MΩ to 100MΩ RD 330Ω\nHIGH- \nVOLTAGE\nDC\nSOURCEDEVICE\nUNDER\nTEST\nFigure 7a.

If in doubt, use capacitors with alarger nominal value. The capacitor’s equivalent seriesresistance (ESR) usually rises at low temperatures andinfluences the amount of ripple on V+ and V-.\nPower-Supply Decoupling \nIn most circumstances, a 0.1µF V CCbypass capacitor is\nadequate. In applications that are sensitive to power-supply noise, use a capacitor of the same value as thecharge-pump capacitor C1. Connect bypass capacitorsas close to the IC as possible.\nTransmitter Outputs\nwhen Exiting Shutdown\nFigure 8 shows two transmitter outputs when exitingshut down mode. As they become active, the two trans-mitter outputs are shown going to opposite RS-232 lev-els (one transmitter output is high, the other is low).Each transmitter is loaded with 3k Ωin parallel with \n1000pF. The transmitter outputs display no ringing orundesirable transients as they come out of shutdown,and are enabled only when the magnitude of V-exceeds approximately -3V.\nHigh Data Rates\nThe MAX3221E/MAX3223E/MAX3243E maintain the RS-232 ±5.0V minimum transmitter output voltage even athigh data rates. Figure 9 shows a transmitter loopbacktest circuit. Figure 10 shows a loopback test result at120kbps, and Figure 11 shows the same test at 250kbps.For Figure 10, all three transmitters were driven simulta-neously at 120kbps into RS-232 loads in parallel with1000pF. For Figure 11, a single transmitter was driven at250kbps, and all three transmitters were loaded with anRS-232 receiver in parallel with 1000pF.\nMouse Driveability (MAX3243E)\nThe MAX3243E has been specifically designed to powerserial mice while operating from low-voltage power sup-plies. It has been tested with leading mouse brands suchas Logitech and Microsoft. When tested, the MAX3243Esuccessfully drove all serial mice and met their respectivecurrent and voltage requirements. The MAX3243E’s regu-lated dual charge pump ensures the transmitters will sup-ply at least ±5V during worst-case conditions. Figure 12ashows the transmitter outputs under increasing load cur-rent. The AutoShutdown feature does not work with amouse, so FORCEOFF and FORCEON should be con-\nnected to V\nCC. Figure 12b (on the following page) shows\na mouse driver test circuit. To achieve mouse driveabilitywith 1µA supply current when the port is inactive, useparts with the AutoShutdown Plus™ feature (such as theMAX3244E and MAX3245E).0.33 0.047 4.5 to 5.50.1 0.1 3.15 to 3.60.22 0.22 3.0 to 3.6C2, C3, C4\n(µF)C1, C BYPASS\n(µF)VCC\n(V)Table 3.
