Its excellent phase accuracy \nand amplitude balance enable high performance intermediate frequency or direct radio frequency modulation for commu-\nnication systems. \nThe ADL5375  features a broad baseband bandwidth, along  \nwith an output gain flatness that varies no more than 1 dB  \nfrom 450 MHz to 3.5 GHz. These features, coupled with a broad-band output return loss of ≤−12 dB, make the ADL5375  ideally \nsuited for broadband zero IF or low IF-to-RF applications, broadband digital predistortion transmitters, and multiband radio designs. \nThe ADL5375  accepts two differential baseband inputs and  \na single-ended LO. It generates a single-ended 50 Ω output.  \nThe two versions offer input baseband bias levels of 500 mV \n(ADL5375-05 ) and 1500 mV ( ADL5375-15 ).  \nThe ADL5375  is fabricated using an advanced silicon-germanium \nbipolar process. It is available in a 24-lead, exposed paddle, lead-\nfree, LFCSP_VQ package. Performance is specified over a −40°C to +85°C temperature range. A lead-free evaluation board is also available.  \n \nADL5375 Data Sheet \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nFeatures  .............................................................................................. 1 \nApplications  ....................................................................................... 1 \nFunctional Block Diagram  .............................................................. 1 \nGeneral Description  ......................................................................... 1 \nRevision History  ............................................................................... 2 \nSpecifications  ..................................................................................... 3 \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  ............................................................ 7 \nESD Caution  .................................................................................. 7 \nPin Configuration and Function Descriptions  ............................. 8 \nTypical Performance Characteristics  ............................................. 9 \nADL5375- 05 .................................................................................. 9 \nADL5375- 15 ................................................................................ 14 \nTheory of Operation  ...................................................................... 19 \nCircuit Description ..................................................................... 19 \nBasic Connections  .......................................................................... 20 \nPower Supply and Grounding  ................................................... 20 \nBaseband Inputs  .......................................................................... 20 LO Input  ...................................................................................... 20 \nRF Output  .................................................................................... 20 \nOutput Disable  ............................................................................ 21 \nApplications Information  .............................................................. 22 \nCarrier Feedthrough  Nulling .................................................... 22 \nSideband Suppression Optimization  ....................................... 22 \nInterfacing the ADF4350 PLL to the ADL5375  ..................... 23 \nDAC Modulator Int erfacing  ..................................................... 24 \nGSM/EDGE Operation  ............................................................. 27 \nW-CDMA Operation  ................................................................. 28 \nLO Generat ion Using PLLs  ....................................................... 29 \nTransmit DAC Options  ............................................................. 29 \nModulator/Demodulator Options  ........................................... 29 \nEvaluation Board  ............................................................................ 30 \nCharacterization Setup  .................................................................. 33 \nOutline Dimensions  ....................................................................... 35 \nOrdering Guide  .......................................................................... 35 \nREVISION HISTORY  \n6/14— Rev.

Connect to th e ground plane via a low impedance path.  \n3, 4 LOIP, LOIN  Local Oscillator Input s. \nSingle -ended operation:  The LOIP pin is driven from the LO source through an ac -coupling capacitor \nwhile the LOIN pin is ac -coupled to ground through a capacitor.  \nDifferent ial operation:  The LOIP and LOIN pins must be driven differentially through ac -coupling \ncapa citors in this mode of operation.  \n6, 7, 13, 15, NC No Connect . These pins can be left open or tied to ground . \n9, 10, 21, 22  QBBN, QBBP , \nIBBP , IBBN  Differential In -Phase and Quadrature Baseband Inputs . These h igh impedance inputs should  be dc -\nbiased to the recommended  level depending on the version.  \nADL5375-05: 500 mV  \nADL5375-15: 1500 mV  \nThese  inputs should  be driven from a low impedance source. Nominal characterized ac signal swing is \n500 mV p -p on each pin. This results in a differen tial drive of 1  V p-p. These inputs are not self -biased \nand have to be externally biased.  \n16 RFOUT  RF Output . Single -ended, 50 Ω internally biased RF output . RFOUT  mus t be ac -coupled to the load.  \n18, 24 VPS1, VPS2  Positive Supply Voltage Pins . All pins should be connected to the same supply (V S). To ensure adequate \nexternal bypassing, connect 0.1 µF and 100 pF capacitors between each pin and ground.  \n EP Exposed Paddle . Connect to the ground plan e via a low impedance path.  \n \nRev.

D | Page 19 of 36 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe ADL5375  can be divided into five circuit blocks: the LO \ninterface, the baseband voltage-to-current (V-to-I) converter, \nthe mixers, the differential-to-single-ended (D-to-S) stage,  and the bias circuit. A block diagram of the device is shown in Figure 53. \nPHASE\nSPLITTERLOIP\nLOIN\nIBBP\nIBBN\nQBBP\nQBBNΣ\n07052-028RFOUT\nDSOP\n \nFigure 53. Block Diagram \nThe LO interface generates two LO signals in quadrature.  These signals are used to drive the mixers. The I/Q baseband input signals are converted to currents by the V-to-I stages, which then drive the two mixers. The outputs of these mixers combine to feed the output balun, which provides a single-\nended output. The bias cell generates reference currents for  \nthe V-to-I stage.  \nLO Interface \nThe LO interface consists of a polyphase quadrature splitter  \nand a limiting amplifier. The LO input impedance is set by  \nthe polyphase splitter. Each quadrature LO signal then passes \nthrough a limiting amplifier that provides the mixer with a \nlimited drive signal.  \nThe LO input can be driven single-ended or differentially.  \nFor applications above 3 GHz, improved OIP2 and LO leakage \nmay result from driving the LO input differentially. V-to-I Converter \nThe differential baseband inputs (QBBP , QBBN, IBBN, and \nIBBP) present a high impedance. The voltages applied to these \npins drive the V-to-I stage that converts baseband voltages into \ncurrents. The differential output currents of the V-to-I stages feed each of their respective mixers. The dc common-mode voltage at the baseband inputs sets the currents in the two  mixer cores. Varying the baseband common-mode voltage \ninfluences the current in the mixer and affects overall modula-\ntor performance. The recommended dc voltage for the baseband common-mode voltage is 500 mV dc for the ADL5375-05  and \n1500 mV for the ADL5375-15 .  \nMixers \nThe ADL5375  has two double-balanced mixers: one for the \nin-phase channel (I channel) and one for the quadrature chan-nel (Q-channel). The output currents from the two mixers sum together into an internal load. The signal developed across this \nload is used to drive the D-to-S stage. \nD-to-S Stage \nThe output D-to-S stage consists of an on-chip active balun  \nthat converts the differential signal to a single-ended signal.  \nThe balun presents 50 Ω impedance to the output (VOUT). Therefore, no matching network is needed at the RF output  \nfor optimal power transfer in a 50 Ω environment. \nBias Circuit \nAn on-chip band gap reference circuit is used to generate a \nproportional-to-absolute temperature (PTAT) reference current \nfor the V-to-I stage.  \nDSOP \nThe DSOP pin can be used to disable the output stage of the \nmodulator. If the DSOP pin is connected to ground or left \nunconnected, the part operates normally. If the DSOP pin is connected to the positive voltage supply, the output stage is \ndisabled and the LO leakage is also reduced. \n \n \nADL5375 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Basic Connections for the ADL5375  \nFigure 54 shows the basic connections for the ADL5375 . \nPOWER SUPPLY AND GROUNDING \nPin VPS1 and Pin VPS2 should be connected to the same 5 V \nsource. Each pin should be decoupled with a 100 pF and  0.1 μF capacitor. These capacitors should be located as close  \nas possible to the device. The power supply can range between \n4.75 V and 5.25 V . \nThe ten COMM pins should be tied to the same ground plane \nthrough low impedance paths.  \nThe exposed paddle on the underside of the package should \nalso be soldered to a ground plane with low thermal and electrical impedance. If the ground plane spans multiple layers on the circuit board, they should be stitched together with nine \nvias under the exposed paddle as illustrated in the Evaluation \nBoard section. The AN-772 Application Note discusses the thermal and electrical grounding of the LFCSP (QFN) package \nin detail.  \nBASEBAND INPUTS \nThe baseband inputs (IBBP , IBBN, QBBP , and QBBN) should be \ndriven from a differential source. The nominal drive level used \nin the characterization of the ADL5375  is 1 V p-p differential \n(or 500 mV p-p on each pin).  All the baseband inputs must be externally dc biased. The \nrecommended common-mode level is dependent on the  \nversion of the ADL5375 . \n\uf0b7 ADL5375-05 : 500 mV \n\uf0b7 ADL5375-15 : 1500 mV \nLO INPUT \nThe LO input is designed to be driven from a single-ended \nsource. The LO source is ac-coupled through a series capacitor \nto the LOIP pin while the LOIN pin is ac-coupled to ground \nthrough a second capacitor. \nThe typical LO drive level, which was used for the characterization \nof the ADL5375 , is 0 dBm. \nDifferential operation is also possible, in which case both sides \nof the differential LO source should be ac-coupled through a \npair of series capacitors to the LOIP and LOIN pins. \nRF OUTPUT \nThe RF output is available at the RFOUT pin (Pin 16), which can \ndrive a 50 Ω load. The internal balun provides a low dc path to \nground. In most situations, the RFOUT pin must be ac-coupled \nto the load.  \nData Sheet ADL5375 \n \nOUTPUT  DISABLE  \nThe ADL5375 incorporates an output disable pin feature that \nshuts down the output amplifier stage to isolate the modulator \nfrom the load. This output is disabled when the voltage on the \nDSOP exceeds 2 V . The output  is enabled  when the DSOP pin is \neither tied to ground or left unconnected.  \nAsserting DSOP further redu ces LO leakage (see Figure 27 and \nFigure 52) and drives the broadband noise of the device down to just above the KT thermal noise level. Asserting DSOP also reduces the supply  current of the ADL5375 from 200 mA to \n127 mA.  \nThe time delay between when  DSOP pin going low and the \noutput power being restored is approximately 200 ns. The time delay  when  DSOP going high and output  being  disable d is less \nthan 100 ns.  \n \nRev. D | Page 21 of 36 \nADL5375 Data Sheet \n \nAPPLICATIONS INFORMA TION  \nCARRIER F EEDTHROUGH NULLING  \nLO leakage  results from  minute dc offsets that occur  on the \ndifferential baseband inputs. In an IQ modulator, non -zero \ndifferential offsets  mix with the LO and result in LO  leakage to \nthe RF output.  In addition to this effect, some of the signal \npower at the LO in put couples directly to the RF o utput (this \nmay be a result of bond -wire to bond -wire coupling or coupling \nthrough the silicon substrate). The  net LO l eakage at the RF \noutput is  the vector combination of  the signals that appear at \nthe output as a result of these two effects.  \nThe device’s  nominal carrier feedthrough  can be  nulled  by \nadding small external differential offset voltages on the I and Q \ninputs.   \nNulling the carrier feedthrough  is a multistep process.  Initially, \nwith  the I -channel offset  held  constant (at 0 mV),  the Q -\nchannel offset is varied until a minimum LO leakage level is \nobtained. This Q -channel offset voltage is then held  constant, \nwhile the offset on the I -channe l is adjusted until a new \nminimum is reached. Through two iterations  of this process, \nthe LO leakage can be reduced to an arbitrarily  low level. This \nlevel is only limited by the available offset voltage steps and by the modulator’s noise floor. Figure 55 illustrates the typical \nrelationship between LO leakage and dc offset at 1900 MHz. In \nthis case, differential offset voltages of approximately +0.5 mV and −0.5 mV on the I and Q  inputs , respectively, result  in the \nlowest carrier feedthrough . It is important to note that the \nrequired offset nulling voltage change s in polarity and \nmagnitude  from device to device and over temperature and \nfrequency.  To ensure tha t all devices in a mass production \nenvironment can be adequately nulled, an  offset adjustment \nrange of approximately ± 10 mV should be provided.

Example of Typical Carrier  Feedthrough  vs. DC Offset Voltage  \nIt is import ant to note that the carrier feed through is not \naffected by the dc bias levels (also called the common -mode \nlevel) on the I and Q inputs.  A differential  offset voltage must \nbe applied, s o after nulling, the average voltage on the IP and IN inputs can be  slightly different.  Using Figure 55 as an \nexample, after LO leakage nulling, the average dc level on IP \nand IN can  be 500.25 mV and  499.75 mV.  \nThe same applies to the Q -channel.  For the ADL5375- 15, the \nsame theory applies except tha t \nVIBBP = VIBBN = 1500 mV . \nIt is often desirable to perform a one- time carrier null. This is \nusually performed at a given frequency.  After this factory \ncalibration, the IQ modulator operates ov er a frequency range \non each side of the calibration frequency. The nulled  LO leakage \nlevel degrades somewhat because  the LO frequency is moved \naway from the calibration frequency.  Despite this degradation, \nthe overall LO leakage across a frequency band can be expected \nto be better than when no nulling is performed. This assumes \nan operating frequency band that is in the 30 MHz to 60 MHz \nrange .  \nLO leakage nul ling is discussed further in AN-1039, Correcting \nImperfections in IQ Modulators to Improve RF Signal Fidelity .  \nSIDEBAND SUPPRESSION  OPTIMIZATION  \nSideband suppression results from relative gain and relative \nphase offsets between the I -channel and Q -channel and can  \nbe suppressed through adjustm ents to those two parameters. \nFigure 56 illustrates how sideband suppression is affected by  \nthe gain and phase imbalances.  \n0dB0.0125dB0.025dB0.05dB0.125dB0.25dB0.5dB1.25dB2.5dB0\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40\n–50\n–60–70\n–80\n–90\n0.01 0.1 1 10 100SIDEBAND SUPPRESSION (dBc)\nPHASE ERROR (Degrees)\n07052-032 \nFigure 56. Sideband Suppression vs. Quadrature Phase Error for  \nVarious Quadr ature Amplitude Offsets \nFigure 56 underlines the fact that adjusting only one parameter \nimproves the sideband suppression only to a point, unless the \nother parameter is also adjusted. For example, if the amplitude offset is 0.25  dB, improving the phase imbalance by better than \n1° does not yield any improvement in the sideband suppression.  \nFor optimum sideband suppression, an iterative adjustment between phase and amplitude is required.  \nThe sideband suppression nulling can be perf ormed either \nthrough adjusting the gain for each channel or through the modification of the phase and gain of the digital data coming \nfrom the baseband  signal processor.  \nRev. D | Page 22 of 36 \nData Sheet ADL5375 \n \nSideband suppression  is discussed further in AN -1100, Wireless \nTransmitter IQ Balance and Sideband Suppression , as well as in \nAN-1039, Correcting Imperfections in IQ Modulators to Improve \nRF Signal Fidelity . \nINTERFACING  THE ADF4350  PLL  TO THE ADL5375 \nWith an output frequency range of 137.5 to 4.4 GHz, a high \nperformance integrated VCO  and an LO ou tput power level \nthat can be programmed from − 4 dBm to +5 dBm,  the \nADF4350 wideband synthesizer is ideally suited to drive the \nADL5375 LO port.  \nCare must be taken to adequately s uppress the harmonics of the  \nLO signal from the  PLL. VCOs typically have a third harmonic \npower of approximately − 10 dBc.  A large third harmonic on the \nLO degrade s the quality of the quadrature generation inside the  \nIQ Modulator. The third harmonic should be suppressed to a \nlevel of  –30 dBc  or lower  to prevent quadrature degradation. So \napproximately 20  dB of attenuation is required to get the third \nharmonic below −30 dBc.  Figure 57 show s PLL m odulator  \ninterfaces  schematic  that f or this operation at four different  \nfrequencies , and Table 4 shows the optimized components value of Figure 57. Because filtering of the third harmonic is most \ncritical, and to ensure wide frequency range coverage, the 3 dB \ncorner of the filters ha ve been  set to approximately 1.2 ~1.5  \ntimes t he maximum desired LO frequency . A Chebyshev filter \ntopology at 100 Ω  differential source impedance and 50  Ω \ndifferential load impedance was used for optimal performance.  \nADF435012 RFOUTA+\n13 RFOUTA–\nADL53753LOIP\n4LOINL1 L21nF\nL1 L21nF\nC1aC1a\nC1c\nC2aC2a\nC2c\nC3aC3a\nC3cZBIASZBIAS120pF 120pF\n0.1µF3.3V\nR1\n07052- 111\n \nFigure 57.

While the ADL5375  is specified to be driven by a single-\nended LO, the LOIP and LOIN input pins are naturally \ndifferential. Therefore, the differential LO drive from the \nADF4350  is more desirable.  \nThe output power from the ADF4350 can be set to −4 dBm,  \n−1 dBm,+2 dBm, and +5 dBm using Register 4 Bits[D2:D1] and −6 dBm to +7 dBm LO drive level for ADL5375  is recommended. \nIf the physical distance between the PLL and the IQ modulator \nis significant, the filter should be placed adjacent to the IQ modulator, and two 50 Ω traces should be run between the devices (since there is a 50 Ω impedance looking from each of the filter inputs back to each of the PLL outputs).  \nThe ADL5375  evaluation board can be reconfigured for \ndifferential drive and also includes component pads in its LO \npath to accommodate a harmonic filter. The ADF4350  evaluation \nboard can also be configured to provide a differential output and \ncan be connected directly to the ADL5375 evaluation board. \nOptimizing the interface between a PLL LO and I/Q modulator \nis discussed further in CN-0134 Broadband Low EVM Direct Conversion Transmitter: How to Optimize the Interface Between a PLL LO and I/Q Modulator. \nDAC MODULATOR INTERFACING \nDriving the ADL5375-05 with a TXDAC® \nThe ADL5375-05  is designed to interface with minimal \ncomponents to members of the Analog Devices, Inc. TxDAC \nfamilies. These dual-channel differential current output DACs \nfeature an output current swing from 0 mA to 20 mA. The interface described in this section can be used with any DAC \nthat has a similar output. \nAn example of an interface using th e AD9122 TxDAC is sh own \nin Figure 58. The baseband inputs of the ADL5375-05 re quire a \ndc bias of 500 mV . The nominal  midscale current on each of \nthe o utputs of the AD9122 is 10 mA. Therefore, a single 50 Ω \nresistor to ground from each of the DAC outputs results in an \naverage curre nt of 10 mA flowing through e ach of the resistors, \nthus producing the desired 500 mV dc bias for the inputs to \nthe ADL5375-05. 67\n66\nIBBNIBBPAD9122 ADL5375-05\n59\n5821\n22\n9\n10IOUT1NIOUT1P\nIOUT2IOUT2N\nQBBPQBBNRBIP\n50Ω\nRBIN\n50Ω\nRBQN\n50Ω\nRBQP\n50Ω\n07052-112\nFi\ngure 58. Interface Between the AD9122  and ADL5375-05 with 50 Ω \nResistors to Ground to Establish the 500 mV DC Bias for the ADL5375-05 \nBaseband Inputs \nThe AD9122 output currents have a swing that ranges from 0 mA \nto 20 mA. With the 50 Ω resistors in place, the ac voltage swing \ngoing into the ADL5375-05  baseband inputs ranges from 0 V to \n1 V . A full-scale sine wave out of the AD9122 can be described \nas a 1 V p-p single-ended (or 2 V p-p differential) sine wave \nwith a 500 mV dc bias. \nLimiting the AC Swing \nThere are situations in which it is desirable to reduce the ac \nvoltage swing for a given DAC output current. This can be \nachieved through the addition of another resistor to the interface. This resistor is placed in the shunt between each side of the \ndifferential pair, as shown in Figure 59. It has the effect of \nreducing the ac swing without changing the dc bias already \nestablished by the 50 Ω resistors. \n67\n66\nIBBNIBBPAD9122 ADL5375-05\n59\n58IOUT1NIOUT1P\nIOUT2IOUT2N\nQBBPQBBNRBIP\n50Ω\nRBIN\n50Ω\nRBQN\n50Ω\nRBQP\n50ΩRLI\n100Ω\nRLQ\n100Ω\n07052-11321\n22\n9\n10\nFigure\n 59.

The filter can be inserted between the dc bias setting \nresistors and the ac swing -limiting resistor.

The −1 dB bandwidth  \nof the ADL5375  is approximately more than 400 MHz  \n(Figure 63 and Figure 64 show  the baseband frequency response \nof the ADL5375 , facilitating high CIF and providing sufficient \nflat bandwidth for d igital predistortion (DPD) algorithms ). \nUsing a CIF places the LO leakage and the undesired sideband \noutside the signal band at the modulator output where they can \nbe easily removed with a bandpass filter.   \n1\n0\n–1\n–2\n–3\n–4\n–5\n–6\n1 10 100 1kBASEBANE FREQUENCY RESPONSE (dB)\nBASEBAND FREQUENCY (MHz)\n07052- 115\n \nFigure 63.

Figure 65 shows a fifth order Butterworth \nfilter with a 300 MHz corner frequency and the frequency \nresponse of this filter is shown in Figure 66.  \nEven a purely differential filter can work well, splitting the filter \ncapacitors into two and grounding at filter topology as like C2 and C4 in Figure 65 divert common mode currents to ground and result in additional common-mode rejection of high frequency signals to a purely differential filter.  \n67\n66\nIBBNIBBPAD9122 ADL5375-05\n59\n5821\n22\n9\n10IOUT1NIOUT1P\nIOUT2IOUT2N\nQBBPQBBNRBIP\n50Ω\nRBIN\n50Ω\nRBQN\n50Ω\nRBQP\n50ΩRSLI\n100Ω\nRSLQ\n100ΩC3I\n6pF\nC3Q\n6pFC1I\n3.6pF\nC1Q\n3.6pFL1PI\n33nH\nL1NI\n33nHL2PI\n33nH\nL2NI\n33nH\nL1NQ\n33nH\nL1PQ\n33nHC2PI\n22pF\nC2NI\n22pFC4PI\n3pF\nC4NI\n3pF\nL2NQ\n33nH\nL2PQ\n33nHC2NQ\n22pF\nC2PQ\n22pFC4NQ3pF\nC4PQ\n3pF\n07052-117  \nFigure 65.

Frequency Response for DAC Modulator Interface with 300 MHz \nFifth-Order Butterworth Filter \nDriving the ADL5375-15 with a TXDAC \nThe ADL5375-15  requires a 1500 mV dc bias and therefore \nrequires a slightly more complex interface that performs a dc \nlevel shift on the baseband signals. It is necessary to level-shift the DAC output from a 500 mV dc bias to the 1500 mV dc bias \nthat the ADL5375-15  requires. \nLevel-shifting can be achieved with either a passive network  \nor an active circuit. A passive network of resistors is shown  \nin Figure 67. In this network, the dc bias of the DAC remains at \n500 mV while the input to the ADL5375-15 is 1500 mV . It should \nbe noted that this passive level-shifting network introduces \napproximately 2 dB of loss in the ac signal. \n67\n66\nIBBNIBBPAD9122 ADL5375-15\n59\n5821\n22\n9\n10IOUT1NIOUT1P\nIOUT2IOUT2N\nQBBPQBBNRBIP\n45.3Ω\nRBIN\n45.3Ω\nRBQN\n45.3Ω\nRBQP\n45.3ΩRLIP\n3480Ω\nRLIN\n3480Ω\nRLQN\n3480Ω\nRLQP\n3480ΩRSIN\n1kΩ\nRSIP\n1kΩ\nRSQN\n1kΩ\nRSQP\n1kΩ5V\n5V\n07052-119 \nFigure 67. Passive Level-Shifting Network For Biasing ADL5375-15  \nfrom TxDAC \nThe active level shifting circuit involves the use of the ADA4938  \ndual-differential amplifier. This device has a VOCM pin that \nsets the output dc bias. Through this pin, the output common-mode of the amplifier can be easily set to the requisite 1.5 V for \nbiasing the ADL5375-15  baseband inputs.  \nData Sheet ADL5375 \n \nUsing the AD9122 DAC  For Carrier Feedthrough and \nUnwanted Sideband Nulling \nThe AD9122 features an auxiliary DAC s (Register 0x42, \nRegister 0x43, Register 0x46, and Register 0x47) or  the digital \ndc offset adjustments ( Register 0x3C through Register 0x3F)  \nthat can be used to null the c arrier feedthrough by applying the \ndc offset voltage at each main DAC channels.  Unwanted \nsideband suppression can be done by adjusting the I/Q phase \n(Register  0x38 through Register 0x3B) and DAC FS (Register \n0x40 and Register 0x44) registers . \nGSM/ EDGE OPERATION  \nThe performance of the ADL5375- 05 in a Multi -Carriers \nGSM/EDGE enviro nment is shown in Figure 68 and Figure 69. \nFigure 68 illustrates the 6 MHz offset noise floor  of the  \nADL5375- 05 at the six  carriers MCGSM/EDGE(8 -PSK)  oper ating \ncondition vs. output power , and Figure 69 demonstrates IMD \nperformance  of the same six  carriers MCGSM/EDGE(8 -PSK)  \nfor the ADL53 75-05 at 950 MHz.

Complex IF at 174.32  MHz is generated  \nat NCO of the AD9122 and fe d into the ADL5375- 05 through a \nfifth order Butterworth filter. Special care must be taken not to \nbe affected by  the noise power of images through proper DAC \nsetup at the selection of IF Frequency, F DATA, FDAC, and so on for  \nsuch a low IMD and n oise level measurement .

The ADL5375  package has an \nexposed paddle on the underside. This exposed paddle should \nbe soldered to the board for good  thermal and electrical grounding. \nThe evaluation board is designed  to minimize LO feedthrough \nto RFOUT through PCB by placing LO block on the underside. And it can be configured to allow differential LO driving through balun or direct interfacing to the PLL evaluation board. It also reserves component pads in its LO path to accommodate a \nharmonic filter. One side placement of baseband inputs is to \ninterface directly to DAC evaluation board. The ADL5375  \nevaluation board also includes an RF driver amplifier. The \nmodulator output can be measured directly at the MOD_OUT SMA connector. Alternatively, by removing R1, and installing a 0 Ω resistor in the R2 pad, the modulator’s output can be fed to \nthe RF driver amplifier.  \nThe evaluation board ships, installed with an ADL5320  driver \namplifier (400 MHz to 2700 MHz RF driver amplifier). This \ndevice requires external matc hing components (C100 and C101) \nand is tuned by default for operation from 1805 MHz to 2170 MHz. \nFor details on tuning component values for other frequencies, \nplease refer to the ADL5320  data sheet (the driver amplifier section \nof the ADL5375  Evaluation Board is identical to the ADL5320 \nEvaluation Board). For higher frequency operation, the ADL5320 \nshould be replaced by the ADL5321, which is specified to operate \nfrom 2.3 GHz to 4 GHz. If a broa dband matched device is desired, \nthe ADL5601 (15 dB) or ADL5602  (20 dB) broadband gain blocks \ncan be used.\n \n \nVPS1\nRFOUTCOMM\nNC\nCOMM\nNC NC\nQBBNCOMMNC\nQBBP\nCOMM\nCOMMVPS2\nIBBNCOMM\nIBBP\nCOMM\nCOMM\nDSOPR15\n49.9ΩVPOS\nB A\nLOIPCOMM\nLOIN\nCOMM1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n618\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13C1\n100pF\nR12\n100ΩS1C5\n0.1µFC3100pF\n24\n23\n22\n21\n20\n197\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12VPOS\nEXPOSED PADDLEADL5375C2\n100pFC40.1µF\nR6\n10kΩ\nQBBN QBBPLOIP\nC7\n100pFR16\nD.N.ILOINR7\n100ΩIBBN IBBP\nVPOS  RED\nRFIN\nRFOUT1 2(2)\n3U2\nADL5320C9 10µF\nC10 10nF\nC11 22pF\nL1\n15nHVPOS_AMP\nRED\nC12\n22pF\nC101 (C7)\n1.5pFAMP_OUT\nC100 (C3)0.5pFλ1 λ3 λ4 λ2AGNDDSOPYELLOW\nAGNDR14\n0Ω\nR19R18\n0Ω\nC17\nD.N.I\nAGND AGNDAGNDAMP_IN\nMOD_OUT\nAGND\nAGNDAGNDAGNDAGNDAGND\nAGNDVPOSR13\n0Ω\nC6\n100pF\nT1TC1-1-43A+**C16\nD.N.I\nR17*0Ω164 3\n1234 5 6\nT2 3600BL14M050T2A 5400BL15B050JOHANSON\nTECHNOLOGY**NCR21*\n0Ω\nR20 D.N.IR22**\nD.N.IR2\n0Ω\n* SINGLE-ENDED LO DRIVING AT LOIP.\n** DIFFERENTIAL LO DRIVING AT LOIP WITH T1 OR T2.\n*** ADL5320 STAND-ALONE TEST.C18\nD.N.I\nAGNDAGND AGND\nAGNDAGND AGND\nAGNDAGND\nAGNDAGNDAGNDAGNDAGND\nAGND    GND\n  BLACKD.N.IR1***\nD.N.I\nU1\n07052-126 \nFigure 75.

Characterization Bench Setup  \n \nThe primary setup used to characterize the ADL5375 is shown \nin Figure 79. This setup was used to evaluate the product as a \nsingle -sideband modulator. The aeroflex signal generator supplied  \nthe LO and differential I and Q baseband signals to the device \nunder tes t (DUT ). The typical LO drive was 0 dBm. The I -channel  \nis driven by a sine wave, and the Q -channel is driven by a cosine \nwave. T he lower sideband is the single- sideband (SSB) output.  The majority of characterization for the ADL5375 was performed  \nusing a 1 MHz sine wave signal with a 500 mV  (ADL5375- 05) \nor 1500 mV ( ADL5375- 15) common -mode voltage applied to \nthe baseband signals of the DUT. The baseband  signal path was \ncalibrated to ensure that the V IOS and V QOS offsets on the bas eband  \ninputs were minimized  as close as possible  to 0 V before  \nconnecting to the DUT.  See the Carrier Feedthrough  Nulling  \nsection for the definitions of V IOS and V QOS. \n \nRev.
