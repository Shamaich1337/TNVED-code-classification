Accesses to these two dataports are concurrent and inde pendent of each other. Access to\neach port is through a common address bus running at DDR. The\ncontrol signals are running at SDR and determine if a read orwrite should be performed. \nThere are three types of differential clocks:\n■(CK, CK#) for address and command clocking\n■(DKA, DKA#, DKB, DKB#) for data input clocking \n■(QKA, QKA#, QKB, QKB#) for data output clocking\nAddresses for port A are latched on the rising edge of the input\nclock (CK), and addresses for port B are latched on the fallingedge of the input clock (CK).\nThis QDR-IV XP SRAM is internal ly partitioned into eight internal\nbanks. Each bank can be acce ssed once for every clock cycle,\nenabling the SRAM to oper ate at high frequencies. \nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM device is offered in a two-word burst\noption and is available in × 18 and × 36 bus width configurations.\nFor an ×18 bus-width configuratio n, there are 22 address bits,\nand for an ×36 bus width configur ation, there are 21 address bits\nrespectively.\nAn on-chip ECC circuitry dete cts and corrects all single-bit\nmemory errors including those in duced by soft error events, such\nas cosmic rays and alpha particles. The resulting SER of these\ndevices is expected to be less than 0.01 FITs/Mb, a\nfour-order-of-magnitude improvement over previous generationSRAMs.\nFor a complete list of related resources, click here .\nSelection Guide\nDescriptionQDR-IV \n2132 (MT/s)QDR-IV \n1866 (MT/s)Unit\nMaximum operating frequency 1066 933 MHz\nMaximum operating current ×18 4100 3400 mA\n×36 4500 4000\nNote\n1.

The\nfollowing sections describe the device operation.\nClocking\nThere are three groups of clock signals: CK/CK#, DKx/DKx#,and QKx/QKx#, where x can be A or B, referring to the respectiveports.\nThe CK/CK# clock is associated with the address and control\npins: A[24:0], LDA#, LDB#, RWA#, RWB#. The CK/CK#\ntransitions are centered with resp ect to the address and control\nsignal transitions.\nThe DKx/DKx# clocks are asso ciated with write data. The\nDKx/DKx# clocks are used as source-centered clocks for theDDR DQx and DINVx pins, when acting as inputs for the write\ndata.\nThe QKx/QKx# clocks are asso ciated with read data. The\nQKx/QKx# clocks are used as source-synchronous clocks for\nthe double data rate DQx and DINVx pins, when acting asoutputs for the read data. \nCommand Cycles\nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM read and write commands are driven by\nthe control inputs (LDA#, LDB#, RWA#, and RWB#) and the\nAddress Bus.\nThe port A control inputs (LDA# and RWA#) are sampled at the\nrising  edge of the input clock. The port B control inputs (LDB#\nand RWB#) are sampled at the falling  edge of the input clock. \nFor port A:\nWhen LDA# = 0 and RWA# = 1, a read operation is initiated.When LDA# = 0 and RWA# = 0, a write operation is initiated.\nThe address is sampled on the rising  edge of the input clock. \nFor port B:\nWhen LDB# = 0 and RWB# = 1, a read operation is initiated.When LDB# = 0 and RWB# = 0, a write operation is initiated.\nThe address is sampled on the falling  edge of the input clock. \nRead and Write Data Cycles\nRead data is suppl ied to the DQA pins ex actly eight clock cycles\nfrom the rising  edge of the CK signal corresponding to the cycle\nwhere the read command was initiated. QVLDA is assertedone-half clock cycle prior to the fi rst data word driven on the bus.\nIt is deasserted one-half cycle prior to the last data word driven\non the bus. Data outputs are tris tated in the clock following the\nlast data word.\nRead data is supplied to the DQB pins exactly eight clock cycles\nfrom the falling  edge of the CK signal corresponding to the cycle\nthat the read command was initiated. QVLDB is asserted\none-half clock cycle prior to the fi rst data word driven on the bus.\nIt is deasserted one-half cycle prior to the last data word driven\non the bus. Data outputs are tris tated in the clock following the\nlast data word.Write data is suppli ed to the DQA pins ex actly five clock cycles\nfrom the rising  edge of the CK signal corresponding to the cycle\nthat the write command was initiated. \nWrite data is supplied to the DQ B pins exactly five clock cycles\nfrom the falling  edge of the CK signal corresponding to the cycle\nthat the write command was initiated. \nBanking Operation\nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM is designed with eight internal banks. Thelower three address pins (A0, A1, and A2) select the bank that\nwill be accessed. These address inputs are also known as bank\naddress pins. \nBank Access Rules\n1. On the rising  edge of the input clock, any bank address  may\nbe accessed. This is the addr ess associated with port A.\n2. On the falling  edge of the input clock, any other bank\naddress  may be accessed. This is the address associated\nwith port B. \n3. If port A did not issue a command on the rising  edge of the\ninput clock, then port B may access any bank address  on the\nfalling  edge of the input clock.\n4. From the rising edge  of the input clock cycle to the next\nrising edge  of the input clock, there is no address\nrestriction . Port A may access any bank at any time.\nTo clarify, the banking restriction only applies in a single clock\ncycle. Since the port A address is sampled on the rising edge ofthe input clock, there are no restrictions with port A access.\nBecause the port B address is sampled on the falling edge of the\ninput clock, port B has the restriction that it must use a differentbank than port A. \nBanking Violations\n1. Accesses for port A cannot c ause a banking violation, only\naccesses to port B can.\n2. If port B tries to access the same bank as port A, then the port\nB access  to the memory array is ignored . The port A access\nwill still occur normally.\n3. If the requested cycle on port B was a write, then there will be\nno external indication that a banking violation occurred.\n4. If the requested cycle on port B was a read, then there will be\nno QVLDB signal generated. Outputs will remain tristated.\nAddress and Data Bus Inversion\nTo reduce simultaneous switching noise and I/O current, QDR-IV\nXP SRAM provides the ability to invert all address and data pins.\nThe AINV pin indicates whether the address bus, A[24:0], and\nthe address parity bit, AP, is inverted. The address bus and paritybit are considered one group. Th e function of the AINV is\ncontrolled by the memory controller. However, the following rules\nshould be used in the system design: \n■For a ×36 configuration part, 21 address pins plus 1 parity bitare used for 22 signals in the address group.If the number of\n0’s in the address group is >\n11, AINV is set to 1 by the controller.\nAs a result, no more than 11 pins may switch in the samedirection during each bit time. \nCY7C4122KV13/CY7C4142KV13\nDocument Number: 001-68255 Rev. *Q Page 10 of 46■For a ×18 data width part, 22 address pins plus 1 parity bit are\nused for 23 signals in the addres s group. If the number of 0s\nin the address group is > 12, AINV is set to 1 by the controller.\nAs a result, no more than 12 pins may switch in the same\ndirection during each bit time.\nThe DINVA and DINVB pins indicate whether the corresponding\nDQA and DQB pins are inverted.\n■For a ×36 data width part, the data bus for each port is split intogroups of 18 pins. Each 18-pin data group is guaranteed to bedriving less than or equal to 10 pins low on any given cycle.If\nthe number of 0s in the data group is >\n10, DINV is set to 1. As\na result, no more than 10 pins ma y switch in the same direction\nduring each bit time. \n■For a ×18 data width part, the data bus for each port is split intogroups of 9 pins. Each 9-pin data group is guaranteed to bedriving less than or equal to five pins low on any given cycle.\nIf the number of 0s in the data group is >\n5, DINV is set to 1. As\na result, no more than five pins ma y switch in the same direction\nduring each bit time.\nAINV, DINVA[1:0], DINVB[ 1:0] are all active high. When set to 1,\nthe corresponding bus is inverted . If the data inve rsion feature is\nprogrammed to be OFF, then t he DINVA/DINVB output bits will\nalways be driven to 0.\nThese functions are programmab le through the configuration\nregisters and can be enabled or disabled for the address bus andthe data bus independently.\nDuring configuration register read and write cycles, the address\ninversion input is ignored and the data inversion output is always\ndriven to 0 when the register read data is driven on the data bus.\nSpecifically, the register read data is driven on DQA[7:0] and the\nDINVA[0] bit is driven to 0.  All other DQA/DQB data bits and\nDINVA/DINVB bits are tristated. In addition, the address parity\ninput (AP) is ignored.\nAddress Parity\nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM provides an address parity feature toprovide integrity on the addres s bus. Two pins are provided to\nsupport this function: AP and PE#.\nThe AP pin is used to provide an even parity across the address\npins. The value of AP is set so that the total number of 1s\n(including the AP bit) is even. The AP pin is a DDR input.\nInternally, when an address parity error is detected, the access\nto the memory array is ignored if it was a write cycle. A read\naccess continues normally even if an address parity error is\ndetected.\nExternally, the PE# pin is used to indicate that an address parity\nerror has occurred. This pin is Active Low and is set to 0 within\nRL cycles after the address parity  error is detect ed. It remains\nasserted until the error is cl eared through the configuration\nregisters.\nThe address parity function is optional and can be enabled or\ndisabled in the configuration registers.\nDuring configuration register read and write cycles, the address\nparity input is ignored. Parity is not checked during these cycles.Note  The memory controller should generate address parity\nbased on the address bus first. Address inversion is done later\non the address bus and address parity bit.\nPort Enable\nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM has two independent bidirectional dataports. However, some system de signers may either choose to\nuse only one port, or use one port as read-only and one port as\nwrite-only. \nIf a port is used in a unidirectional mode, disable the data clocks\n(DKx/DKx# or QKx/QKx#) to reduce EMI effects in the system.\nIn addition, disable the corresponding control input (RWx#). \nPort B may be programmed to be entirely disabled. If port B is\nnot used, then the following must happen:\n■The data clocks (DKB/DKB# an d QKB/QKB#) and the control\ninputs (LDB# and RWB#) must be disabled.\n■All data bus signals must be tri-stated. This includes DQB,\nDINVB, and QVLDB.\n■All input signals related to port B can be left floating or tied toeither 1 or 0 without any adverse effects on the port A operation.\n■When port B is not used, all out put signals related to port B are\ninactive. \nA configuration register option is provided to specify if one of the\nports is not used or is opera ting in a unidirectional mode. \nOn-Die Termination (ODT) Operation\nWhen enabled, the ODT circuits for the chip will be enabled\nduring all NOP and write cycles. The ODT is temporarily disabledonly during read cycles because the read data is driven out. \nSpecifically, ODT is disabled one-half clock cycle before the first\nbeat of the read data is driven on the data bus and remains\ndisabled during the entire read oper ation. ODT is enabled again\none-half clock cycle after the last beat of read data is driven onthe data bus.\nJTAG Operation\nThe JTAG interface uses five si gnals: TRST#, TCK, TMS, TDI,\nand TDO. For normal JTAG operation, the use of TRST# is not\noptional for this device. \nWhile in the JTAG mode, the following conditions are true:\n■ODT for all pins is disabled.\nIf the JTAG function is not us ed in the system, then the TRST# \npin must be tied to VDD and the TCK input must be driven low or tied to VSS. TMS, TDI, and TDO may be left floating.\nPower-Up and Reset\nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM has specific power-up and reset\nrequirements to guarantee reliable operation. \nPower-Up Sequence\n■Apply VDD before VDDQ.\n■Apply VDDQ before VREF or at the same time as VREF.\nCY7C4122KV13/CY7C4142KV13\nDocument Number: 001-68255 Rev. *Q Page 11 of 46Reset Sequence\nRefer to the Reset timing diagram ( Figure 16 on page 41 ).\n1. As the power comes up, all inputs may be in an undefined\nstate, except RST# and TRST #, which must be LOW during\ntPWR.\n2. The first signal that should be driven to the device is the input\nclock (CK/CK#), which may be unstable for the duration of\ntPWR.\n3. After the input clock has stabilized, all the control inputs\nshould be driven to a valid value as follows:\na. RST# = 0b. CFG# = 1c. LBK0# = 1d. LBK1# = 1e. LDA# = 1f. LDB# = 1\n4. Reset should remain asserted, while all other control inputs\ndeasserted, for a minimum time of 200 µs (t\nRSS).\n5. At the rising edge of reset, the address bits A[13:0] are\nsampled to load in the ODT values and Port Enable values.After reset, internal operations  in the device may start. This\nmay include operations, such as PLL initialization and\nresetting internal registers.\n6. However, all external control signals must remain deasserted\nfor a minimum time of 400000 clocks (t\nRSH). During this time\nall other signals (data and address busses) should be drivento a valid level. All inputs to the device should be driven to a\nvalid level.\n7. After this, the device is in normal operating mode and ready\nto respond to control inputs.\nTypically, after a reset sequence, the system starts to perform a\ntraining sequence involving the steps outlined in the following\nsection. \nHowever, RST# may be asserted at any time by the system and\nthe system may wish to initiate normal read/write operations after\na reset sequence, without going through another trainingsequence. The chip should be able to accept normal read/write\noperations immediately following t\nRSH after the deassertion of\nRST#. \nPLL Reset Operation\nThe configuration registers contain a bit to reset the PLL.\nOperating the QDR-IV XP SRAM  device without the PLL enabled\nis not supported—timing char acteristics are not guaranteed\nwhen the PLL is disabled. However, this bit is intended to allow\nthe system to re set the PLL locking circuitry.\nResetting the PLL is accomplished by first programming the PLL\nReset bit to 1 to disable the PLL, and then programming the bitto 0 to enable the PLL. After th ese steps, the PLL will relock to\nthe input clock. A wait time of tPLL is required. Operation Modes\nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM has three unique modes of operation:\n1. Configuration\n2. Loopback\n3. Memory Access\nThese modes are defined by t he level of the control signals\nCFG#, LBK0#, LBK1#, LDA#, LDB#. \nIt is intended that these operati ons are mutually exclusive. In\nother words, one operation mode cannot be performed\nsimultaneously with another operation mode. \nThere is no priority given  for inadvertently asserting the control\nsignals at the wrong time. The internal chip behavior is notdefined for improper control signal assertion. The system must\nstrictly adhere to proper mode transitions, as defined in the\nfollowing sections, for proper device operation. \nConfiguration\nA Configuration operation mode is entered when the CFG#\nsignal is asserted. Memory Access or Loopback operationsshould not be performed for a minimum of 32 clocks prior to\nentering this mode.\nWhile in this mode, the control signals LDB#, LBK0#, and LBK1#\nmust not be asserted. However, LDA# is used to perform the\nactual Register Read and Write operations. \nMemory Access or Loopback operations should not be\nperformed for a minimum of 32 cl ocks after exiting this mode. \nLoopback\nA Loopback operation mode is entered when the LBK0# and/or\nLBK1# signals are asserted. Me mory Access or Configuration\noperations should not be performed for a minimum of 32 clocks\nprior to entering this mode.\nJust after entering this mode , an additional 32 clocks are\nrequired before the part is ready to accept toggling valid inputs\nfor training.\nWhile in this mode, LDA# and LDB# may be toggled for training.\nMemory Access or Configuratio n operations should not be\nperformed for a minimum of 32 cl ocks after exiting this mode.\nData inversion is not used during the Loopback mode. Even if\nthe configuration register has th is feature enabled, it is tempo-\nrarily ignored during the Loopback mode. \nMemory Access\nIf the control signals CFG#, LBK0#, and LBK1# are not asserted,\nthen the device is in the Memory Access mode. This mode is thenormal operating mode of the device.\nWhile in this mode, a memory access cycle is performed when\nthe LDA# and/or LDB# signals are asserted. The control signals\nCFG#, LBK0#, and LBK1# must not be asserted when\nperforming a memory access cycle.\nA memory access should not be performed for a minimum of 32\nclocks prior to leaving this mode. \nCY7C4122KV13/CY7C4142KV13\nDocument Number: 001-68255 Rev. *Q Page 12 of 46Deskew Training Sequence\nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM provides support that allows a memory\ncontroller to deskew signals for a high-speed operation. The\nmemory controller provides the deskew function if deskew isdesired. During the deskew operation, the QDR-IV XP SRAMoperates in the Loopback mode.\nRefer to the Loopback Timing Diagram ( Figure 15 on page 40 ).\nDeskew is achieved in three steps: \n1. Control/address deskew2. Read data deskew\n3. Write data deskew\nControl/Address Deskew\nAssert LBK0# to 0 and/or LBK1# to 0.\nThe following 39 signals are looped back:\n■DKA0, DKA0#, DKA1, DKA1#\n■DKB0, DKB0#, DKB1, DKB1#\n■LDA#, RWA#, LDB#, RWB#\n■A[24:0], AINV, AP\nThe clock inputs DKA0, DKA0#, DKA1#, DKB0, DKB0#, DKB1,\nand DKB1# are free-running clock inputs and should be\ncontinuously running during the training sequence. In addition, a\nwait time of tPLL is needed.\nRefer to Table 1 on page 14  for the loopback signal mapping.\nFor each pin that is looped back, the input pin is sampled on both\nthe rising and falling edges using the input clock (CK/CK#).\nThe value output on the rising edge of the output clock\n(QKA/QKA#) will be the value that was sampled on the rising\nedge of the input clock.\nThe value output on the falling edge of the output clock\n(QKA/QKA#) will be the inverted  value that was sampled on the\nfalling edge of the input clock.\nThe delay from the input pi ns to the DQA outputs is tLBL, which\nis 16 clocks. \nRead Data Deskew\nAt this time, the ad dress, control, and data input clocks are\nalready deskewed.\nRead data deskew requires a training pattern to be written into\nthe memory using data held at constant values. \nComplex data patterns, such as t he following, may be written into\nthe memory using the non-deskewed DQA and/or DQB signals\nand the write training enable bit.\nWrite training enable set to 1:\nDuring Write Data Cycles:\nThe First Data Beat (First Data Burst) is sampled from the databus.The Second Data Beat (Second Data Burst) is the inverted\nsample from the same data bus.\nWrite training enable set to 0:\nDuring Write Data Cycles:\nBoth First and Second Data Beats are sampled from the databus, which is the normal operation.The Write Training Enable bit has no effect on the read data\ncycles.\nAfter the data pattern is writte n into the memory, standard read\ncommands permit the system to  deskew with respect to the\nQK/QK# data output clocks the following signals:\nDQA, DINVA, QVLDA, DQB, DINVB, QVLDB \nWrite Data Deskew\nWrite data deskew is performed using write commands to the\nmemory followed by read commands.\nThe deskewed read data path is used to determine whether or\nnot the write data was receiv ed correctly by the device.\nThis permits the system to deske w with respect to the DK/DK#\ninput data clocks th e following signals:\nDQA, DINVA, DQB, DINVB \nI/O Signaling Standards\nSeveral I/O signaling standards are supported by the QDR-IV, \nwhich are programmable by the user. They are:\n■1.2 V and 1.25 V HSTL/SSTL\n■1.1 V and 1.2 V POD\nThe I/O Signaling Standard is programmed on the rising edge of\nreset by sampling the address bus inputs. Once programmed,the value cannot be changed. Only the rising edge of another\nreset can change the value.\nAll address, control, and data I/O signals — with the exception\nof six pins (listed as LVCMOS in the LVCMOS Signaling  section)\n— will program to comply with HSTL/SSTL or POD.\nHSTL/SSTL Signaling\nHSTL/SSTL is supported at the V\nDDQ voltages of 1.2 V and\n1.25 V nominal.\nThe ODT termination values can be set to:\n■40, 60, or 120 ohms with a 220-ohm reference resistor\n■50 or 100 ohms with a 180-ohm reference resistor.\nThe drive strength can be programmed to:\n■40 or 60 ohms with a 220- ohm reference resistor\n■50 ohms with a 180-ohm reference resistor\nA reference resistor of 180 ohms or 220 ohms is supported with\nHSTL/SSTL signaling. \nPOD Signaling\nPOD is supported at VDDQ voltages of 1.1 V and 1.2 V nominal.\nThe ODT termination values can be set to:\n■50 or 100 ohms with a 180-ohm reference resistor\n■60 or 120 ohms with a 220-ohm reference resistor\nThe drive strength can be programmed to:\n■50 ohms with a 180-ohm reference resistor\n■40 or 60 ohms with a 220- ohm reference resistor\nA reference resistor of 180 ohms or 220 ohms is supported with\nPOD signaling. \nCY7C4122KV13/CY7C4142KV13\nDocument Number: 001-68255 Rev. *Q Page 13 of 46LVCMOS Signaling\nSix I/O signals are permanently set to use LVCMOS signaling at\na voltage of 1.3-V nominal. These signals are referenced to the\ncore voltage supply, VDD. They are: \nRST#, TRST#, TCK, TMS, TDI, and TDO\nAll the five JTAG signals as well as the main reset input are 1.3-V\nLVCMOS.\nIn addition, ODT is disabled at all times on these LVCMOS\nsignals. \nInitialization\nThe QDR-IV XP SRAM must be in itialized before it can operate\nin the normal functional mode. In itialization uses four special\npins: \n■ RST# pin to reset the device\n■ CFG# pin to program th e configuration registers\n■ LBK0# and LBK1# pins for the loopback functionThe following flowchart illustrates the initialization procedure:\nFigure 3.

All registers are 8-bits wide. The write\noperation is performed using only the address pins to define the\nregister address and register write data. For a read operation,\nthe register read data is provided  on the data port A output pins.\nRefer to Figure 14 on page 39  for programming details.\nDuring the rising edge of RST#, the address pins A[13:0] are\nsampled. The value sampled beco mes the reset value of certain\nbits in the registers defined in Table 2 on page 15 . This is used\nto set termination, impedance, and port configuration values\nimmediately upon reset. These va lues can be overwritten later\nthrough a register write operation.\nWhen a parity error occurs, the complete address of the first\nerror is recorded in registers 4, 5,  6, and 7 along with the port A/B\nerror bit. The port A/B error bit will indicate from which port the\naddress parity error came — 0 for port A and 1 for port B. This\ninformation will remain latched until cleared by writing a 1 to theaddress parity error clear bit in register 3.\nTwo counters are used to indicate if multiple address parity errors\noccurred. The Port A error count is a running count of the number\nof parity errors on port A addresse s, and similarly the port B error\ncount is a running count of the nu mber of parity errors on port B\naddresses. They will each independently count to a maximum\nvalue of 3 and then stop c ounting. These counters are\nfree-running and they are both reset by writing a 1 to the addressparity error clear bit in register 3. Table 1.

This part is fully\ncompliant with IEEE St andard #1149.1- 2001. In the JTAG mode,\nthe ODT feature for all pins is disabled.\nIf the JTAG function is not used in the circuit, then TCK inputs\nmust be driven low or tied to VSS. TRST#, TMS, TDI, and TDOmay be left floating. An internal  pull-up resistor is implemented\non the TRST#, TMS, and TDI input s to ensure that these inputs\nare HIGH during t\nPWR.\nTest Access Port\nTest Clock (TCK)\nThe test clock is used only with t he TAP controller. All inputs are\ncaptured on the rising edge of TCK. All outputs are driven from\nthe falling edge of TCK.\nTest Mode Select (TMS)\nThe TMS input is used to give  commands to the TAP controller\nand is sampled on the rising edge of TCK. This pin may be left\nunconnected if the TAP is not  used. The pin is pulled up\ninternally, resulting in a logic HIGH level.\nTest Data-In (TDI)\nThe TDI pin is used to serially input information into the registers\nand can be connected to the input  of any of the registers. The\nregister between TDI and TDO is chosen by the instruction that\nis loaded into the TAP instruction register. For information onloading the instruction register, see TAP Controller State\nDiagram on page 22 . TDI is internally pulled up and can be\nunconnected if the TAP is unused in an application. TDI isconnected to the most signific ant bit (MSB) on any register.\nTest Data-Out (TDO)\nThe TDO output pin is used to serially clock data out from the\nregisters. The output is active , depending upon the current state\nof the TAP state machine (see Instruction Codes on page 26 ).\nThe output changes on the falling edge of TCK. TDO isconnected to the least significant bit (LSB) of any register.\nTest Reset (TRST#)\nThe TRST# input pin is used to reset the TAP controller.Alternatively, a reset may be performed by forcing TMS HIGH\n(V\nDD) for five rising edges of TCK. \nThis reset does not affect the operation of the SRAM and can be\nperformed while the SRAM is ope rating. At power-up, the TAP is\nreset internally to ensure that TDO comes up in a high Z state.\nTAP Registers\nRegisters are connected between the TDI and TDO pins to scanthe data in and out of the SRAM test circuitry. Only one register\ncan be selected at a time thro ugh the instruction registers. Data\nis serially loaded into the TDI pin on the rising edge of TCK. Datais output on the TDO pin on the falling edge of TCK.Instruction Register\nThree-bit instructions can be serially loaded into the instruction\nregister. This register is loaded when it is placed between the TDI\nand TDO pins, as shown in TAP Controller Block Diagram on\npage 23 . Upon power-up, the instruction register is loaded with\nthe IDCODE instruction. It is also loaded with the IDCODEinstruction if the controller is pl aced in a RST state, as described\nin the previous section.\nWhen the TAP controller is in the Capture-IR state, the two least\nsignificant bits are loaded with a binary “01” pattern to allow for\nfault isolation of the board-level serial test path.\nBypass Register\nTo save time when serially shifting data through registers, it is\nsometimes advantageous to skip certain chips. The bypassregister is a single-bit register that can be placed between TDI\nand TDO pins. This enables shifting of data through the SRAM\nwith minimal delay. The bypass register is set LOW (VSS) whenthe BYPASS instruction is executed.\nBoundary Scan Register\nThe boundary scan register is connected to all of the input and\noutput pins on the SRAM. Several No Connect (NC) pins are also\nincluded in the scan register to reserve pins for higher density\ndevices.\nThe boundary scan register is loaded with the contents of the\nRAM input and output ring when the TAP controller is in theCapture-DR state and is then placed between the TDI and TDO\npins when the controller is moved to the Shift-DR state. The\nEXTEST, SAMPLE/PRELOAD, and SA MPLE Z instructions can\nbe used to capture the contents of the input and output ring.\nBoundary Scan Order on page 27  shows the order in which the\nbits are connected. Each bit co rresponds to one of the bumps on\nthe SRAM package. The MSB of the register is connected to TDI\nand the LSB is connected to TDO.\nIdentification (ID) Register\nThe ID register is loaded with a vendor-specific, 32-bit code\nduring the Capture-DR state when the IDCODE command is\nloaded in the instruction register . The IDCODE is hardwired into\nthe SRAM and can be shifted out w hen the TAP controller is in\nthe Shift-DR state. The ID regist er has a vendor code and other\ninformation described in Identification Register Definitions on\npage 26 .\nTAP Instruction Set\nEight different instructions ar e possible with the three-bit\ninstruction register. All combinations are listed in Instruction\nCodes on page 26 . Three of these instructions are listed as\nRESERVED and must not be used. The other five instructions\nare described in this section in detail.\nInstructions are loaded into the TAP controller during the Shift-IR\nstate when the instruction regi ster is placed between TDI and\nTDO. During this state, instructions are shifted through theinstruction register through the TDI and TDO pins. To execute\nthe instruction after it is shi fted in, the TAP controller must be\nmoved into the Update-IR state.\nCY7C4122KV13/CY7C4142KV13\nDocument Number: 001-68255 Rev. *Q Page 21 of 46IDCODE\nThe IDCODE instruction loads a vendor-specific, 32-bit code into\nthe instruction register. It also  places the instruction register\nbetween the TDI and TDO pins and shifts the IDCODE out of the\ndevice when the TAP controller enters the Shift-DR state. The\nIDCODE instruction is loaded into the instruction register atpower-up or whenever the TAP controller is supplied a\nTest-Logic-RST state.\nSAMPLE Z\nThe SAMPLE Z instruction connects the boundary scan register\nbetween the TDI and TDO pins when the TAP controller is in a\nShift-DR state. The SAMPLE Z co mmand puts the output bus\ninto a High Z state until the next command is supplied during the\nUpdate IR state. Both Port A and Port B are enabled once this\ncommand has been executed.\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD is a 1149.1 mandatory instruction. When\nthe SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructions are loaded into theinstruction register and the TAP c ontroller is in the Capture-DR\nstate, a snapshot of data on the input and output pi ns is captured\nin the boundary scan register.\nRemember that the TAP controller clock can only operate at a\nfrequency up to 20 MHz, while the SRAM clock operates morethan an order of magnitude faster. Because there is a large\ndifference in the clock frequencies, it is possible that an input or\noutput undergoes a transition duri ng the Capture-DR state. The\nTAP may then try to capture a signal while in transition\n(metastable state). This does not harm the device, but there is\nno guarantee as to the value that  is captured. Repeatable results\nmay not be possible.\nTo guarantee that the boundary scan register captures the\ncorrect value of a signal, the SRAM signal must be stabilized\nlong enough to meet the TAP controller’s capture setup plus hold\ntimes (t\nCS and tCH). The SRAM clock input might not be captured\ncorrectly if there is no way in a de sign to stop (or slow) the clock\nduring a SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructi on. If this is an issue, it is\nstill possible to capture all other signals and simply ignore thevalue of the CK and CK\n captured in the boundary scan register.\nAfter the data is captured, it is  possible to shift out the data by\nputting the TAP into the Shift-DR state. This places the boundary\nscan register between the TDI and TDO pins.\nPRELOAD places an initial data pattern at the latched parallel\noutputs of the boundary scan regist er cells before the selection\nof another boundary scan test operation.The shifting of data for the SAMPLE and PRELOAD phases can\noccur concurrently when required, that is, while the data\ncaptured is shifted out, the pr eloaded data can be shifted in.\nBYPASS\nWhen the BYPASS instruction is loaded in the instruction register\nand the TAP is placed in a Shift-DR state, the bypass register is\nplaced between the TDI and TDO pins. The advantage of theBYPASS instruction is that it shortens the boundary scan path\nwhen multiple devices are connected together on a board.\nEXTEST\nThe EXTEST instruction drives the preloaded data out through\nthe system output pins. This in struction also connects the\nboundary scan register for serial access between the TDI andTDO in the Shift-DR controller stat e. Both Port A and Port B are\nenabled after this command is executed. \nEXTEST OUTPUT BUS TRISTATE\nIEEE Standard 1149.1 mandates that  the TAP controller be able\nto put the output bus into a tristate mode.\nThe boundary scan register has output enable control bits\nlocated at Bit #49 and Bit #50. Bit# 49 enables the output pins\nfor DQB and Bit#50 enables DQA and PE# pins. \nWhen these scan cells, called the “e xtest output bus tristate,” are\nlatched into the preload register during the Update-DR state in\nthe TAP controller, they directly  control the state of the output\n(Q-bus) pins, when the EXTEST is entered as the current\ninstruction. When HIGH, it enables the output buffers to drive the\noutput bus. When LOW, this bi t places the output bus into a\nHigh Z condition.\nThese bits can be set by entering the SAMPLE/PRELOAD or\nEXTEST command, and then shifting the desired bit into that cell,\nduring the Shift-DR state. During Update-DR, the value loaded\ninto that shift-register cell latc hes into the preload register. When\nthe EXTEST instruction is entered, these bits directly controls the\noutput Q-bus pins. Note that these bits are pre-set LOW to\ndisable the output when the device is powered up, and also whenthe TAP controller is in the Test-Logic-RST state. \nReserved\nThese instructions are not im plemented but are reserved for\nfuture use. Do not use these instructions.\nCY7C4122KV13/CY7C4142KV13\nDocument Number: 001-68255 Rev. *Q Page 22 of 46TAP Controller State Diagram\nFigure 4.
