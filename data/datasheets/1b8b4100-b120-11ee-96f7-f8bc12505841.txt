The MP4575 can provide 5A of \ncontinuous output current with peak current \ncontrol for excellent transien t response  and \nefficiency performance .  \nThe wide 4.5V to 55V input voltage range  \naccommodates a variety of step -down  \napplications, including industrial, PoE, \nautomotive , and printer s with a DC high-voltage  \nbus.  \nThe MP4575  uses peak -current -mode control  to \nregulate the output voltage.  The MP4575 \nprovides over-current protection  (OCP) with \nvalley current  detection , which is used to \nprevent the current from running away. The \nMP4575 also has accurate and reliable o ver-\nvoltage  protection  (OVP) and auto-recovery \nthermal  protection.  \nAn optional external soft start is available. \nEnable and power good indication function s can \nbe used to track the power easily. To increase \nefficiency, the MP4575  scales down the \nswitching frequency automatically when the \nload is light. Meanwhile, the low -side MOSFET \nis turned off to reduce driver loss when zero \ninductor current is detected.  \nSynchronous operation mode with the \nintegrated  low-side MOSFET is useful for \nreduc ing conduction loss and reducing external \ncomponents  space  to save cost. \nThe MP4575  is available in  a TSSOP -20 EP \npackage with an exposed pad .

All Rights Reserved.  \nOPERATION   \nThe MP4575  is a step -down switching regulator \nwith integrated , high-voltage , power MOSFET s. \nThe MP4575 features a  wide input v oltage \nrange, high efficiency, external and internal soft \nstart, programmable  frequency, and \ncomprehensive prote ction  mode s. \nPulse -Width Modulation ( PWM ) Control  \nThe MP4575  uses peak -current -mode control  to \nregulate the output voltage.  \nA PWM cycle is initiated by the internal clock  at \nthe beginning of every cycle . After the high -side \nMOSFET (HS-FET) turns on, the  inductor \ncurrent  rises linearly to provide energy to the \nload. The HS-FET remains on until its current \nreaches the COMP voltage (VCOMP), which  is \nthe output of the internal error a mplifier  (EA). \nThe output voltage of the EA depends on the \ndifference of the output feedback voltage and \nthe internal high-precision reference , and VCOMP \ndecide s how much energy should be \ntransferred  to the load . The higher the load \ncurrent, the higher VCOMP. After the high -side \nswitch  is off, the low -side switch  turns on, and \nthe inductor current flow s through the low -side \nswitch. To prevent  a shoo t-through, a dead time \nis inserted to prevent the HS-FET and LS -FET \nfrom turning on at the same time. For each  turn-\non and turn-off in a switching cycle, the HS-FET \nremains on and off with a minimum on and off \ntime limit. \nLight -Load Operation  \nThe MP4575  can achieve high efficiency during \nlight load  in two ways.  First, when the load \ncurrent  decreases, the inductor current drop s at \nsame time. The LS-FET turns off to save driver \nloss when the inductor current drops to zero. \nSecond, when the load decreases, the \nswitching frequency is scaled down to reduce \nswitching loss  after VCOMP drops below a certain \nthreshold .  \nError Amplifier  (EA)  \nThe error amplifier (EA) compares the FB \nvoltage with the internal reference and outputs \na current proportional to the difference between \nthe two. This current is used to charge the \nexternal compensation networks to form VCOMP, which is used to control  the HS-FET peak \ncurrent and regulate the output voltage.  \nOscillator and SYNC  Function  \nThe internal oscillator frequency  is set by a \nsingle external resistor (RFREQ) connected \nbetween  FREQ and GND. The frequency -\nsetting resistor should be lo cated close to the \ndevice. The relationship between the oscillator \nfrequency and RFREQ is shown in Table 1 on \npage 17 . \nDuring light load, the switching frequency is \nscaled  down according to VCOMP. The switching \nfrequency begins decreasing  when VCOMP is \nbelow about 0.8V. Switching is disabled when \nVCOMP drops below about 0.7V. \nTo reduce switching loss and thermal \ndissipation , the switching frequency is \ndecreased according to the FB voltage. When \nFB is lower than 25%xREF, the switching \nfrequency starts to  decrease from the normal \nvalue  and drops to 5% of the normal value \nwhen FB  is zero.  \nFREQ can be used to synchronize the internal \noscillator  rising edge  to an external clock  falling \nedge . Ensure that the high amplitude of the \nsynchronous (SYNC) clock is higher  than 1.5V \nand the low amplitude is lower than 1V to drive \nthe internal logic. The recommended  external \nSYNC  frequency  is in the range of 100kHz and \n1MHz.  There is no pulse width requirement , but \nthere is always a parasitic capacitance of the \npad. If the p ulse width is too short, a clear rising \nand falling edge may not be seen due to the \nparasitic capacitance.  A pulse longer than \n100ns is recommended in application.  \nEnable ( EN) Control  \nEnable ( EN) is a control pin that turns the \nregulator on and off . Drive EN hig her than 1.6V  \nto turn on the regulator ; drive EN lower than \n1.3V to turn  off the regulator . There is no \ninternal pull -up or pull -down circuitry  at EN, so \nwhen EN is floating, its status is uncertain.  \nEN is clamped internally using a 6. 5V Zener \ndiode  between EN and GND . Connecting EN to \na voltage source directly without any pull -up \nresistor requires limiting the voltage amplitude \nto ≤6V to prevent damage to the Zener diode.  \nEN can be connected to a higher voltage  (e.g.: \nVIN) through a pull-up resistor if the system \nMP4575 – 5A, 55V, SYNCHRON OUS , STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMP4575  Rev. 1.0 www.MonolithicPower.com  15 \n8/16/2016  MPS Proprietary Information.

Ensure that the pull -up resistor is \nhigh enough to ensure that the sink current \ngoing into EN is less than 150 µA to avoid \ndamaging the Zener diode.  For example, when \nconnecting EN to V IN = 12V, R PULL -UP ≥ (12V - \n6.5V) ÷ 1 50µA = 37kΩ. \nSoft Start  (SS) \nSoft start (SS) is implemented to ensure a \nsmooth start-up of the output  voltage  during \npower -on and power -off. The soft start function \nalso helps to reduce inrush current at start -up.  \nThe soft start function is achieve d by ramping \nSS up slowly and overriding  the internal \nreference (REF) when SS  - 900mV is lower \nthan REF. When SS  - 900mV is higher than \nREF, REF regains control. 900mV is the offset \nvoltage of SS , which means that SS is detected \nas 0 internally when it is lower than 900mV. To \nminimize the delay for SS to reach 0.9V,  an \ninternal pull -up circuit with about 30 µA of \naverage current pulls SS up to 600mV first. \nThen use a 4µA constant current to charge SS \nuntil it reaches 2.5V. When SS is in the range of \n0.9V to 1.9V, it overrides REF as the reference \nvoltage of the error amplifier. During  this period, \nthe output voltage ramps up from 0 to the \nregulated value following SS rising.  The soft -\nstart time  (tSS) set by the external SS capacitor \ncan be calculated with Equation (1) : \n \nA)(I(V)V (nF)C(ms)t\nSSREF SS\nSSμ\uf0b4\uf03d  (1) \nWhere C SS is the external SS capacitor , VREF is \nthe internal reference voltage (1V), and I SS is \nthe 4 µA SS charge current.  \nThe delay time for SS reaching  900mV can be \nestimated  with Equation (2) : \n \nA40.3V (nF)C\nA300.6V (nF)C(ms) tSS SS\n_delaySSμ μ\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d  (2) \nThere is also an  internal , fixed , 500µs soft start . \nThe final SS time  is determined by the longer \ntime between 500μs and the external SS setting \ntime.   \nWhen the output voltage is shorted to GND, the \nfeedback voltage is pulled low , and then SS is \ndischarged. The MP4575 soft start s again when \nthe short at the output is removed.   Internal Regulator  and BIAS  \nAn internal 2.5V regulator powers all of the \ninternal control circuits. This regulator uses VIN \nas the power supply when BIAS is lower than \n3.2V and uses BIAS as the supply when BIAS \nis higher than 3.2V.  \nThe VDD regulator powers the low -side driver \nand the BST regula tor when the VDD voltage is \nhigher than 4.5V. VDD is powered by VIN when \nBIAS is floating and is regulated at 3.6V. When \nBIAS is higher  than 4.2V, it power s VDD. VDD \nincreases as BIAS rises  with a 600mV voltage \ndrop and is regulated at 4.8V when BIAS is \nhigher than 5.4V.  A 1µF decoupling capacitor is \nneeded at VDD to make the capacitor as close \nto VDD as possible.  \nUsing BIAS to power the internal regulator can \nimprove efficiency. It is recommended to \nconnect BIAS to an external power supply in \nthe range of  3.3V to 5.5V. The output voltage is \na good choice for this power supply if it is in  \nabove  range.  A 0.1µF to 1 µF decoupling \ncapacitor at BIAS is recommended.  \nOver -Voltage Protection  (OVP)  \nThe MP4575  monitors the feedback  output \nvoltage to achieve over-voltage protection  \n(OVP) . If the FB voltage is higher than \n103%xREF, the MP4575  switches to sleep \nmode , the HS-FET turn off s, and the LS -FET \nturns on to discharge the output energy.

This is useful for \npreventing an inductor current runaway.  Both \nthe peak current limit and the valley current limit \nvalue s are dependent on the FB voltage. If the \nfeedback output voltage is higher than \n50%xREF , the current limit value is normal. If \nthe feedback output vo ltage  is lower than \n50%xREF, the current limit decrease s to half \nthe normal value when the feedback output \nvoltage is zero. This feature is useful for \nreducing  OCP thermal dissipation , which may \nworsen when the output voltage is shorted . It is \nalso useful for reducing  high inrush current \nduring start -up. \nUnder -Voltage Lockout ( UVLO ) Protection  \nThe MP4575  has an input under -voltage \nlockout (UVLO)  protection . When EN is active, \nthe MP4575  is powered on when the input \nvoltage is higher than the UVLO rising thr eshold , \nand is powered off when the input voltage drops \nbelow  the UVLO falling threshold.  \nThermal Shutdown Protection  \nThe thermal shutdown is employed in the \nMP4575  by monitoring the IC temperature \ninternally. If the junction temperature  exceeds \nthe thresh old (typically 170°C), the regulator \nshuts off and turns on again when  the \ntemperature drops below  160°C. There is a \nhystere sis of about 10°C.  \nPower Good  (PG)  \nThe MP4575  uses one power good  (PG)  pin out \nto indicate normal operation after the soft-start \ntime.  \nPG is the open drain of the internal MOSFET. \nPG should be connected to VDD  or an external \nvoltage source through a resistor (i.e. : 100k Ω). \nAfter the input voltage is applied, the MOSFET \nis turned on , and PG is pulled to GND before \nSS is ready. After the FB voltage reaches 90% \nof the REF voltage , the MOSFET turns off , and \nPG is pulled high  by an external voltage source . \nWhen the FB voltage  drops to 85% of the REF \nvoltage, the PG voltage is pulled to GND to \nindicate a failure output status.  Floating Driver and Bootstrap Charging  \nAn external bootstrap capacitor  (typically  0.1µF) \nbetween BST and SW powers the floating \npower MOSFET driver . This floating driver has \nits own UVLO protection. This UVLO’s  rising \nthreshold is 2.3V with a hysteresis  of 300mV. \nThe driv er’s UVLO is soft -start related.  When \nthe bootstrap voltage reaches its UVLO \nthreshold, the soft -start circuit resets. When the \nbootstra p UVLO is removed , the soft-start reset \nis off , and the soft -start process resumes.  \nThe dedicated internal bootstrap regulator \nregulates and charges the bootstrap capacitor \nto 4.2V. When the voltage between the BST \nand SW nodes is less than its regulation,  a \nPMOS pass transistor from VIN to BST turns \non. The ch arging current path is from VIN  to \nBST to SW.  \nAs long as VIN is sufficiently higher than V SW, \nthe bootstrap capacitor can be charge d. When \nthe HS-FET is on, VIN  ≈ VSW, so the bootstrap \ncapacitor cannot be charge d. When the LS-FET \nis on, the difference between VIN and V SW is at \nits largest, making this the best period to \ncharge. When there is no current in the \ninductor, V SW = VOUT, so the difference between \nVIN and  VOUT can charge the bootstrap \ncapacitor.  \nAt higher duty cycles, the time period available \nfor bootstrap charging is shorter , so the \nbootstrap capacitor may not be sufficiently \ncharge d. If the internal circuit does not have \nsufficient voltage , and the boot strap capacitor is \nnot charged, extra external circuitry can be \nused to ensure that the bootstrap voltage is \nwithin the normal operating  region.  \nMP4575 – 5A, 55V, SYNCHRONOUS , STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMP4575  Rev. 1.0 www.MonolithicPower.com  17 \n8/16/2016  MPS Proprietary Information.

Th e switching frequency (f SW) can be  \nset using a resistor at FREQ (R FREQ). Table 1 \nshows recommended R FREQ value s for various \nfSW values . Refer to the fSW vs. R FREQ curve in \nthe Typical Characteristics section on page 8 \nfor more detailed values.  \nTable 1 : fSW vs. R FREQ  \nfSW (kHz)  RFREQ (kΩ) \n1000  47.5 \n900 56 \n800 63.4 \n700 73.2 \n600 84.5 \n500 102 \n400 133 \n300 178 \n200 261 \n100 523 \nSetting the Output Voltage  \nA resistive voltage divider from the output \nvoltage to FB sets the output voltage. The \nvoltage divider divides the output voltage down \nto the feedback voltage by the ratio  shown in \nEquation (3) : \n \nFB OUTR2V =V\nR1+R2\uf0b4  (3) \nCalculated the output voltage with Equation (4) : \n \nOUT FBR1+R2V =V\nR2\uf0b4  (4) \nFor example, if R1 is 10kΩ,  then R2 can be \ncalculated with Equation (5) : \n \nkΩ1 V10R2\nOUT\uf02d\uf03d  (5) \nSo for a 3.3V output voltage, R 1 is 10kΩ, and \nR1 is 4.32kΩ. \nSelecting the Inductor  \nThe inductor provides a constant current to the \noutput load while being driven by the switched  \ninput voltage. A larger -value inductor result s in \na lower ripple current and lower output ripple \nvoltage , but also is physically larger, has a higher series resistance, and lower saturation \ncurrent.   \nTo determine the inductance, allow the \ninductor’s peak -to-peak ripple current to equal \napproximately 30% of the maximum switch \ncurrent limit. Ensure that the peak inductor \ncurrent is less than the maximum switch current \nlimit. The inductance value can be calculated \nwith Equation (6) : \n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d\nINOUT\nL SWOUT\nVV1ΔI fVL1  (6) \nWhere V OUT is the output voltage, VIN is the \ninput  voltage, f S is the switching frequency, and \n∆IL is the peak -to-peak inductor ripple current.  \nChoose an inductor that will not saturate under \nthe maximum inductor peak current. The peak \ninductor current can be calculated with \nEquation (7) : \n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf02b\uf03d\nINOUT\nSWOUT\nLOAD LPVV1L1 f2VII  (7) \nWhere I LOAD is the load current.  \nSelecting the Input Capacitor  \nThe input current to the step -down converter is \ndiscontinuous and requires a capacitor to \nsupply AC current to the step -down converter \nwhile maintaining the DC input voltage. Use \ncapacitors with low equivalent series \nresistances (ESR) for the best performance. \nCeramic capacitors are preferred , but tantalum \nor low -ESR electrolytic capacitors may also be \nsufficient .  \nFor simplification, choose an input capacitor \nwith an RMS current ra ting greater than half of \nthe maximum load current. The input capacitor \n(C1) can be electrolytic, tantalum, or ceramic.  \nWhen using electrolytic or tantalum capacitors, \nplace a small, high -quality, ceramic capacitor \n(0.1μF) as close to the IC as possible. When \nusing ceramic capacitors, ensure that they have \nenough capacitance to provide a sufficient \ncharge to prevent excessive voltage ripple at \nthe input. The input voltage ripple caused by \ncapacitance can be approximated with Equation \n(8): \nMP4575 – 5A, 55V, SYNCHRON OUS , STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMP4575  Rev. 1.0 www.MonolithicPower.com  18 \n8/16/2016  MPS Proprietary Information.

Use ceramic, tantalum, or low -\nESR electrolytic capacitors. Low  ESR \ncapacitors are recommended  to keep the output \nvoltage ripple low. The output voltage ri pple can \nbe estimated with Equation (9) : \n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\n\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03dC2 f81RVV1L fVΔV\nSWESR\nINOUT\nSWOUT\nOUT  (9) \nWhere L is the inductor value , and R ESR is the \nESR value of the output capacitor.  \nFor ceramic capacitors, the capacitance \ndominates the impedance at the switching \nfrequency and contribu tes the most to the \noutput voltage ripple. For simplification, the \noutput voltage ripple can be estimated with \nEquation (10) : \n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d\nINOUT\n2\nSWOUT\nOUTVV1C2L f8VΔV  (10) \nFor tantalum or electrolytic capacitors, the ESR \ndominates the impedance at the switching \nfrequency.

The \nMP4575  can be optimized for a wide range of \ncapacitances and ESR values.  \nCompensation Components  \nThe MP4575  employs current -mode control for \neasy compensation and fast transient response. \nCOMP is the output of the internal error \namplifier and controls system stability and \ntransient response. A series resistor -capacitor \ncombination sets a pole -zero combination to \ncontrol the control system’s characteristics. The \nDC gain of the voltage feedback loop can be \ncalculated with Equation (12) : \n \nOUTFB\nVEA CS LOAD VDCVVA G R A \uf0b4\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d  (12) Where  AVEA is the error amplifier volta ge gain  \n(1000V/V ), GCS is the current -sense \ntransconductance  (12A/V), and RLOAD is the \nload resistor value.  \nThe system has two important poles: one from \nthe compensation capacitor (C 3) and the output \nresistor of error amplifier, and the other due to \nthe o utput capacitor and the load resistor. \nThese poles can be determined with Equation \n(13) and Equation (14) : \n \nVEAEA\nP1AC32πGf\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d  (13) \n \nLOADP2RC22π1f\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d  (14) \nWhere  GEA is the e rror-amplifier \ntransconductance  (540μA/V ). \nThe system has one important  zero due to the \ncompensation capacitor and the compensation \nresistor (R 3). This zero can be determined with \nEquation (15) : \n \nR3C32π1fZ1\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d  (15) \nThe system may have another significant zero if \nthe output capacitor has a large capacitance or \na high  ESR value. This zero can be determined \nwith Equation (16) : \n \nESRESRRC22π1f\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d  (16) \nIn this case, a third pole set by the \ncompensation capacitor (C 4) and the \ncompensation resistor can compensate for the \neffect of the ESR zero. This pole can be \ndeterm ined with Equation (17) : \n \nR3C42π1fP3\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d  (17) \nThe goal of compensation design is to shape \nthe converter transfer function for a desired \nloop gain. The system crossover frequency \nwhere the feedback lo op has unity gain is \nimportant, since lower crossover frequencies \nresult in slower line and load transient \nresponses, while higher crossover frequencies \nlead to system instability. Generally, set the \ncrossover frequency to ~0.1 xfSW. \nMP4575 – 5A, 55V, SYNCHRON OUS , STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMP4575  Rev. 1.0 www.MonolithicPower.com  19 \n8/16/2016  MPS Proprietary Information.

Choose C 3 to achieve the desired phase \nmargin. For applications with typical \ninductor values, set the compe nsation zero \n(fZ1) to <0.25 xfC to provide a sufficient phase \nmargin. C 3 can be calculated with Equation \n(19): \n \nCfR32π4C3\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03e  (19) \n3. Determine if C4 is required .

This \naffects efficiency  and normal operation. An \nexternal bootstrap  diode  from the 3V - 5V rail to \nBST can help charg e the bootstrap  capacitor \nand enhance efficiency  (see Figure 2) . The \noutput voltage is a good choice for this power \nsupply if it is in above range.

For a sufficient gate voltage during \npulse -skipping  mode , VIN  - VOUT should be no \nless than 3V. For example, if V OUT = 3.3V, then \nVIN must  exceed 3.3V  + 3V = 6.3V to maintain \na sufficient bootstrap voltage at no  load or light  \nload. To meet this r equirement, EN can \nprogram the input UVLO voltage to V OUT + 3V. \nMP4575 – 5A, 55V, SYNCHRON OUS , STEP -DOWN CONVERTER  \n \nMP4575  Rev. 1.0 www.MonolithicPower.com  20 \n8/16/2016  MPS Proprietary Information.
