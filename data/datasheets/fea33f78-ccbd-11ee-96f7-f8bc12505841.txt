The main power-switching circuit consistsof two n-channel MOSFETs, an inductor, and input/out-put filter capacitors. An all n-channel synchronous-rec-tified design provides high efficiency at reduced cost.These devices have an internal 5V linear regulator thatsteps down the input voltage to supply the IC and thegate drivers. The low-side-switch gate driver is directlypowered from the 5V regulator (VL), while the high-side-switch gate driver is indirectly powered from VLplus an external diode-capacitor boost circuit.\nCurrent-Limit and \nShort-Circuit Protection\nThe MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548 employ a valley cur-\nrent-sensing algorithm that uses the R DS(ON) of the low-\nside n-channel MOSFET to sense the current. Thiseliminates the need for an external sense resistor usuallyplaced in series with the output. The voltage measuredacross the low-side MOSFET’s R\nDS(ON) is compared to\na fixed -320mV reference for the MAX8545/MAX8548and a fixed -165mV reference for the MAX8546. The cur-rent limit is given by the equations below:\nAside from current limiting, these devices feature fold-\nback short-circuit protection. This feature is designedto reduce the current limit by 80% as the output voltagedrops to 0V.\nMOSFET Gate Drivers\nThe DH and DL drivers are optimized for driving n-chan-nel MOSFETs with low gate charge. An adaptive dead-time circuit monitors the DL output and prevents thehigh-side MOSFET from turning on until the low-sideMOSFET is fully off. There must be a low-resistance,low-inductance connection from the DL driver to theMOSFET gate for the adaptive dead-time circuit to workproperly. Otherwise, the sense circuitry in the MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548 may detect the MOSFET gate as offwhile there is actually charge left on the gate. Use veryshort, wide traces measuring no less than 50mils to 100mils wide if the MOSFET is 1in away from the MAX8545/\nMAX8546/MAX8548. The same type of adaptive dead-time circuit monitors the DH off edge. The same recom-mendations apply for the gate connection of thehigh-side MOSFET.\nThe internal pulldown transistor that drives DL low is\nrobust, with a 1.1 Ω(typ) on-resistance. This helps pre-\nvent DL from being pulled up due to capacitive cou-pling from the drain to the gate of the low-sidesynchronous-rectifier MOSFET during the fast rise timeof the LX node.\nSoft-Start\nThe MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548 feature an internallyset soft-start function that limits inrush current. It accom-plishes this by ramping the internal reference input to thecontroller’s transconductance error amplifier from 0 tothe 0.8V reference voltage. The ramp time is 1024 oscil-lator cycles for the MAX8548 and 2048 oscillator cyclesfor the MAX8545/MAX8546. At the nominal 100kHz and300kHz switching rate, the soft-start ramp is approxi-mately 10.2ms and 6.8ms, respectively.\nHigh-Side Gate-Drive Supply (BST)\nA flying-capacitor boost circuit generates gate-drive volt-age for the high-side n-channel MOSFET. The flyingcapacitor is connected between the BST and LX nodes.\nOn startup, the synchronous rectifier (low-side MOSFET)\nforces LX to ground and charges the boost capacitor toVL. On the second half-cycle, the MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548 turn on the high-side MOSFET by closing aninternal switch between BST and DH. This provides thenecessary gate-to-source voltage to drive the high-sideMOSFET gate above its source at the input voltage.\nInternal 5V Linear Regulator\nAll MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548 functions are internallypowered from an on-chip, low-dropout 5V regulator (VL).These devices have a maximum input voltage (V\nIN) of\n28V. Connect V CCto VL through a 10 Ωresistor and\nbypass V CCto GND with a 0.1µF ceramic capacitor. The\nVIN-to-VL dropout voltage is typically 140mV, so when V IN\nis less than 5.5V, VL is typically V IN- 140mV.\nThe internal linear regulator can source a minimum of\n25mA and a maximum of approximately 40mA to supplypower to the IC low-side and high-side MOSFET drivers.\nDuty-Cycle Limitations for \nLow V OUT/VINRatios\nThe MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548s’ output voltage is\nadjustable down to 0.8V. However, the minimum dutycycle can limit the ability to supply low-voltage outputsImV\nRMAX LIMIT\nDS ON=1658546\n()()ImV\nRMAX MAX LIMIT\nDS ON=3208545 8548\n()(/)\nMAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548Low-Cost, Wide Input Range, Step-Down\nControllers with Foldback Current Limit\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 9from high-voltage inputs. With high input voltages, the\nrequired duty factor is approximately:\nwhere R DS(ON) x ILOAD is the voltage drop across the\nsynchronous rectifier. Therefore, the maximum inputvoltage (V\nIN(DFMAX) ) that can supply a given output\nvoltage is:\nIf the circuit cannot attain the required duty cycle dic-\ntated by the input and output voltages, the output volt-age still remains in regulation. However, there may beintermittent or continuous half-frequency operation asthe controller attempts to lower the average duty cycleby deleting pulses. This can increase output voltageripple and inductor current ripple, which increasesnoise and reduces efficiency. Furthermore, circuit sta-bility is not guaranteed.\nApplications Information\nDesign Procedures\n1) Input Voltage Range . The maximum value\n(VIN(MAX) ) must accommodate the worst-case high\ninput voltage. The minimum value (V IN(MIN) ) must\naccount for the lowest input voltage after drops dueto connectors, fuses, and switches are considered.In general, lower input voltages provide the bestefficiency.\n2) Maximum Load Current . There are two current\nvalues to consider. Peak load current (I\nLOAD(MAX) )\ndetermines the instantaneous component stressesand filtering requirements and is key in determiningoutput capacitor requirements. I\nLOAD(MAX) also\ndetermines the required inductor saturation rating.Continuous load current (I\nLOAD ) determines the\nthermal stresses, input capacitor, and MOSFETs,as well as the RMS ratings of other heat-contribut-ing components such as the inductor.\n3) Inductor Value . This choice provides tradeoffs\nbetween size, transient response, and efficiency.Higher inductance value results in lower inductorripple current, lower peak current, lower switchinglosses, and, therefore, higher efficiency at the costof slower transient response and larger size. Lowerinductance values result in large ripple currents,smaller size, and poor efficiency, while also provid-ing faster transient response.Setting the Output Voltage\nAn output voltage between 0.8V and (0.83 x V IN) can\nbe configured by connecting FB to a resistive dividerbetween the output and GND (see Figures 1 and 2).Select resistor R4 in the 1k Ωto 10kΩrange. R3 is then\ngiven by:\nwhere V\nFB= +0.8V.\nInductor Selection\nDetermine an appropriate inductor value with the fol-\nlowing equation:\nwhere LIR is the ratio of inductor ripple current to aver-\nage continuous maximum load current. Choosing LIRbetween 20% to 40% results in a good compromisebetween efficiency and economy. Choose a low-core-loss inductor with the lowest possible DC resistance.Ferrite-core-type inductors are often the best choice forperformance; however, the MAX8548’s low switchingfrequency also allows the use of powdered iron coreinductors in ultra-low-cost applications where efficiencyis not critical. With any core material, the core must belarge enough not to saturate at the peak inductor cur-rent (I\nPEAK ):\nSetting the Current Limit\nThe MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548 provide valley cur-rent limit by sensing the voltage across the externallow-side MOSFET. The minimum current-limit thresholdvoltage is -280mV for the MAX8545/MAX8548 and-140mV for the MAX8546.

This type of current limit provides a coarse levelof fault protection. It is especially suited when the inputsource is already current-limited or otherwise protected.\nPower MOSFET Selection\nThe MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548 drive two external,logic-level, n-channel MOSFETs as the circuit switchingelements. The key selection parameters are:\n1) On-resistance (R\nDS(ON) ): the lower, the better.\n2) Maximum drain-to-source voltage (V DSS) should be\nat least 10% higher than the input supply rail at thehigh-side MOSFET’s drain.\n3) Gate charges (Q\nG, QGD, QGS): the lower, the better.\nChoose the MOSFETs with rated R DS(ON) at VGS= 4.5V\nfor an input voltage greater than 5V, and at V GS= 2.5V\nfor an input voltage less than 5.5V. For a good compro-mise between efficiency and cost, choose the high-sideMOSFET (N1) that has conduction losses equal to theswitching losses at nominal input voltage and maximumoutput current. For N2, make sure it does not spuriouslyturn on due to a dV/dt caused by N1 turning on as thiswould result in shoot-through current degrading theefficiency. MOSFETs with a lower Q\nGD/QGSratio have\nhigher immunity to dV/dt.\nMOSFET Power Dissipation\nFor proper thermal-management design, the power dis-sipation must be calculated at the desired maximumoperating junction temperature, maximum output cur-rent, and worst-case input voltage (for the low-sideMOSFET (N2) the worst case is at V\nIN(MAX) , for the high-\nside MOSFET (N1) the worst case can be either atV\nIN(MIN) or V IN(MAX) ). N1 and N2 have different loss\ncomponents due to the circuit operation. N2 operates asa zero-voltage switch; therefore, the major losses are:the channel conduction loss (P\nN2CC ), the body-diode\nconduction loss (P N2DC ), and the gate-drive loss\n(PN2DR ):\nUse R DS(ON) at TJ(MAX) :\nwhere V Fis the body-diode forward voltage drop, t dtis\nthe dead time between N1 and N2 switching transitions(which is 30ns), and f\nSis the switching frequency.Because of zero-voltage switch operation, the N2 gate-\ndrive losses are due to charging and discharging theinput capacitor, C\nISS. These losses are distributed\nbetween the average DL gate driver’s pullup and pull-down resistors and the internal gate resistance. TheR\nDLis typically 1.8 Ω, and the internal gate resistance\n(RGATE ) of the MOSFET is typically 2 Ω. The drive\npower dissipated in N2 is given by:\nN1 operates as a duty-cycle control switch and has the\nfollowing major losses: the channel conduction loss(P\nN1CC ), the voltage and current overlapping switching\nloss (P N1SW ), and the drive loss (P N1DR ). N1 does not\nhave a body-diode conduction loss because the diodenever conducts current:\nUse R\nDS(ON) at TJ(MAX) :\nwhere I GATE is the average DH high driver output-cur-\nrent capability determined by:\nwhere R DHis the high-side MOSFET driver’s average\non-resistance (2.05 Ωtyp) and R GATE is the internal\ngate resistance of the MOSFET (2 Ωtyp):\nwhere V GS~ VL.\nIn addition to the losses above, allow about 20% more\nfor additional losses due to MOSFET output capaci-tance and N2 body-diode reverse recovery charge dis-sipated in N1. Refer to the MOSFET data sheet forthermal resistance specifications to calculate the PCboard area needed. This information is essential tomaintain the desired maximum operating junction tem-perature with the above calculated power dissipation.\nTo reduce EMI caused by switching noise, add a 0.1µF\nceramic capacitor from the high-side MOSFET drain tothe low-side MOSFET source or add resistors in seriesPQ V fR\nRRND R G S G S SGATE\nDH GATE1 =× × ×+IVL\nRRGATE ON\nDH GATE() =×+1\n2PV IfQQ\nIN SW IN LOAD SGS GD\nGATE1 =× × ×+PV\nVIR NC COUT\nINLOAD DS ON 12=⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟×() × ()PC VfR\nRRN DR ISS GS SGATE\nGATE DL22=× () ××+\nPI V t fN DC LOAD F dt S2 2=× × × ×PV\nVIR NC COUT\nINLOAD DS ON 221 =−⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟×× ()\nMAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548Low-Cost, Wide Input Range, Step-Down\nControllers with Foldback Current Limit\n12 ______________________________________________________________________________________with DH and DL to slow down the switching transitions.\nHowever, adding series resistors increases the powerdissipation of the MOSFET, so ensure temperature rat-ings of the MOSFET are not exceeded.\nInput-Capacitor Selection\nThe input capacitors (C2 and C3 in Figure 1) reducenoise injection and current peaks drawn from the inputsupply. The input capacitor must meet the ripple-cur-rent requirement (I\nRMS) imposed by the switching cur-\nrents. The RMS input ripple current is given by:\nFor optimal circuit reliability, choose a capacitor that\nhas less than 10°C temperature rise at the RMS current.I\nRMS is maximum when the input voltage equals 2 x\nVOUT, where I RMS = 1/2 I LOAD .\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nThe key parameters for the output capacitor are theactual capacitance value, the equivalent series resis-tance (ESR), the equivalent series inductance (ESL),and the voltage-rating requirements. All these parame-ters affect the overall stability, output ripple voltage,and transient response.\nThe output ripple has three components: variations in the\ncharge stored in the output capacitor, the voltage dropacross the ESR, and the voltage drop across the ESL.\nV\nRIPPLE = VRIPPLE(ESR) + VRIPPLE(C) + VRIPPLE(ESL)\nThe output voltage ripple as a consequence of the ESR\nand output capacitance is:\nwhere I P-Pis the peak-to-peak inductor current (see the\nInductor Selection section).\nWhile these equations are suitable for initial capacitor\nselection to meet the ripple requirement, final valuesmay also depend on the relationship between the LCdouble-pole frequency and the capacitor ESR-zero fre-quency. Generally, the ESR zero is higher than the LCdouble pole; however, it is preferable to keep the ESRzero close to the LC double pole when possible to\nnegate the sharp phase shift of the typically high-Qdouble LC pole (see the Compensation Design sec-\ntion). Aluminum electrolytic or POS capacitors are rec-ommended. Higher output current requires multiplecapacitors to meet the output ripple voltage.\nThe MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548s’ response to a load\ntransient depends on the selected output capacitor. Aftera load transient, the output instantly changes by (ESR xΔI\nLOAD ) + (ESL x dI/dt). Before the controller can\nrespond, the output deviates further depending on theinductor and output capacitor values. After a short periodof time (see the Typical Operating Characteristics ), the\ncontroller responds by regulating the output voltage backto its nominal state. The controller response timedepends on the closed-loop bandwidth. Higher band-width results in faster response time, preventing the out-put voltage from further deviation. Do not exceed the\ncapacitor’s voltage or ripple-current ratings .\nBoost Diode and Capacitor Selection\nA low-current Schottky diode, such as the CMPSH-3\nfrom Central Semiconductor, works well for most appli-cations. Do not use large power diodes since higherjunction capacitance can charge up BST to LX voltagethat could exceed the device rating of 6V. The boostcapacitor should be in the range of 0.1µF to 0.47µF,depending on the specific input and output voltagesand the external components and PCB layout. Theboost capacitance needs to be as large as possible toprevent it from charging to excessive voltage, but smallenough to adequately charge during the minimum low-side MOSFET conduction time, which happens at themaximum operating duty cycle (this occurs at the mini-mum input voltage). In addition, ensure the boostcapacitor does not discharge to below the minimumgate-to-source voltage required to keep the high-sideMOSFET fully enhanced for lowest on-resistance. Thisminimum gate-to-source voltage V\nGS(MIN) is deter-\nmined by:\nwhere Q Gis the total gate charge of the high-side\nMOSFET and C BOOST is the boost capacitor value.\nCompensation Design\nThe MAX8545/MAX8546/MAX8548 use a voltage-modecontrol scheme that regulates the output voltage. This isdone by comparing the error amplifier’s output (COMP) toa fixed internal ramp.

The error amplifier must compensate for thisgain drop and phase shift to achieve a stable high-bandwidth, closed-loop system.\nThe basic regulator loop consists of a power modulator\n(Figure 3), an output feedback divider, and an erroramplifier. The power modulator has DC gain set byV\nIN/VRAMP , with a double pole set by the inductor and\noutput capacitor, and a single zero set by the outputcapacitor (C\nOUT) and its equivalent series resistance\n(ESR). Below are equations that define the power mod-ulator:\nThe DC gain of the power modulator is:\nwhere V\nRAMP = 1V.\nThe pole frequency due to the inductor and output\ncapacitor is:\nThe zero frequency due to the output capacitor’s ESR is:\nThe output capacitor is usually comprised of several\nsame capacitors connected in parallel. With n capaci-tors in parallel, the output capacitance is:\nC\nOUT= n x C EACH\nThe total ESR is:\nThe ESR zero (f ZESR ) for a parallel combination of\ncapacitors is the same as for an individual capacitor.\nThe feedback divider has a gain of G FB= VFB/VOUT,\nwhere V FBis 0.8V.\nThe transconductance error amplifier has DC gain\nGEA(dc) of 72dB. A dominant pole (f DPEA ) is set by the\ncompensation capacitor (C C), the amplifier output\nresistance (R O) equals 37M Ω, and the compensation\nresistor (R C):The compensation resistor and the compensation\ncapacitor set a zero:\nThe total closed-loop gain must equal unity at the\ncrossover frequency. The crossover frequency shouldbe higher than f\nZESR , so that the -1 slope is used to\ncross over at unity gain. Also, the crossover frequencyshould be less than or equal to 1/5 the switching fre-quency (f\nSW) of the controller:\nThe loop-gain equation at the crossover frequency is:\nVFB/VOUTx GEA(f C)x GMOD(f C)= 1\nwhere G EA(f C)= g mEA ×RC, and G MOD(f C)=\nGMOD(DC) ×(fPMOD )2 / (fZESR ×fC).\nThe compensation resistor, R C, is calculated from:\nRC= VOUT/ gmEA x VFBx GMOD(f C)\nwhere g mEA = 108µS.\nDue to the underdamped (Q > 1) nature of the output\nLC double pole, the error-amplifier compensation zeroshould be approximately 0.2 f\nPMOD to provide good\nphase boost. C Cis calculated from:\nA small capacitor, C F, can also be added from COMP to\nGND to provide high-frequency decoupling. C Fadds\nanother high-frequency pole, f PHF, to the error-amplifier\nresponse. This pole should be greater than 100 times theerror-amplifier zero frequency to have negligible impacton the phase margin. This pole should also be less than1/2 the switching frequency for effective decoupling:\n100 f\nZEA< fPHF< 0.5 f sw\nSelect a value for f PHFin the range given above, then\nsolve for C Fusing the following equation:\nPCB Layout Guidelines\nCareful PCB layout is critical to achieve low switchinglosses and stable operation.

Follow these\nguidelines for good PCB layout:\n1) Keep the high-current paths short, especially at the\nground terminals. This practice is essential for sta-ble, jitter-free operation.\n2) Connect the power and analog grounds close to\nthe IC pin 7.\n3) Keep the power traces and load connections short.\nThis practice is essential for high efficiency. Usingthick copper PCBs (2oz vs. 1oz) can enhance full-load efficiency by 1% or more. Correctly routingPCB traces is a difficult task that must beapproached in terms of fractions of centimeters,where a few milohms of excess trace resistancecause a measurable efficiency penalty.\n4) LX and GND connections to the low-side MOSFET\nfor current sensing must be made using Kelvinsense connections to guarantee the current-limitaccuracy. With 8-pin MOSFETs, this is best doneby routing power to the MOSFETs from outsideusing the top copper layer, while connecting LXand GND inside (underneath) the 8-pin package.5) When tradeoffs in trace lengths must be made, it is\npreferable to allow the inductor charging currentpath to be longer than the discharge path. Forexample, it is better to allow some extra distancebetween the inductor and the low-side MOSFET orbetween the inductor and the output filter capacitor.\n6) Ensure that the connection between the inductor\nand C3 is short and direct.\n7) Route switching nodes (BST, LX, DH, and DL) away\nfrom sensitive analog areas (COMP and FB).\nEnsure the C1 ceramic bypass capacitor is immediately\nadjacent to the pins and as close to the device as possi-ble. Furthermore, the V\nINand GND pins of MAX8545/\nMAX8546/MAX8548 must terminate at the two ends ofC1 before connecting to the power switches and C2.
