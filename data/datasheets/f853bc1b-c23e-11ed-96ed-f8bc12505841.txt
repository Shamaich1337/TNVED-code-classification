The devicedrives a center-tapped transformer primary from a 5Vor 3.3V DC power supply.  The secondary can bewound to provide any isolated voltage needed at powerlevels up to 1W.\nThe MAX253 consists of a CMOS oscillator driving a\npair of N-channel power switches.  The oscillator runsat double the output frequency, driving a toggle flip-flop to ensure 50% duty cycle to each of the switches.Internal delays are arranged to ensure break-before-make action between the two switches.\nThe SD pin puts the entire device into a low-power\nshutdown state, disabling both the power switches andoscillator.\nApplications\nIsolated RS-485/RS-232 Power-Supply\nTransformer Driver\nHigh Noise-Immunity Communications InterfaceIsolated and/or High-Voltage Power SuppliesBridge Ground DifferentialsMedical EquipmentProcess ControlBenefits and Features\n•Simple Power-Supply Transformer Driver Design for\nIsolated RS-485/RS-232 Data-Interface Applications\n•Single 5V or 3.3V Supply\n•Low-Current Shutdown Mode: 0.4µA\n•Pin-Selectable Frequency: 350kHz or 200kHz\n•8-Pin DIP, SO, and µMAX ®Packages Take Minimal\nBoard Space\nOrdering Information\nMAX253D1\nD2 FS\nGND1 GND2VCC 1\n846\n273VIN\nSD\nFREQUENCY\nSWITCHC3C1\nC25V @ 200mAOUTPUT5VON / OFFTypical Operating CircuitPART TEMP RANGE PIN-PACKAGE \nMAX253CPA 0°C to +70°C 8 Plastic DIP\nMAX253CSA 0°C to +70°C 8 SO\nMAX253CUA 0°C to +70°C 8 µMAX\nMAX253C/D 0°C to +70°C Dice*\nMAX253EPA -40°C to +85°C 8 Plastic DIP\nMAX253ESA -40°C to +85°C 8 SO\nMAX253ESA/V -40°C to +85°C 8 SO\nMAX253MJA -55°C to +125°C 8 CERDIP**\n*Contact factory for dice specifications.\n**Contact factory for availability and processing to MIL-STD-883.\nDevices are also available in a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant\npackage.

Completely isolatedcommunications are obtained by combining theMAX253 with a linear regulator, a center-tapped trans-former, optocouplers, and the appropriate Maxim inter-face product (as described in the \nIsolated\nRS-485/RS-232 Data Interface section).\nThe MAX253 consists of an RC oscillator followed by a\ntoggle flip-flop, which generates two 50% duty-cyclesquare waves, out-of-phase at half the oscillator fre-quency (Figure 2).  These two signals drive the ground-\nreferenced output switches.  Internal delays ensurebreak-before-make action between the two switches.\nGround SD for normal operation.  When high, SD dis-\nables all internal circuitry, including the oscillator andboth power switches.\nPulling FS low reduces the oscillator frequency and low-\ners the supply current (see Supply Current vs.Temperature in the \nTypical Operating Characteristics ).\nFS includes a weak pull-up, so it will be set to the high-frequency state if not connected.MAX253D1\nD2 FS\nGND1 GND2VCC\n1\n846\n273SD\nFREQUENCY\nSWITCHON / OFF\nR2\n50ΩR1\n50ΩVIN\n5V C1\n0.1μF\nFigure 1.

These circuits withstand 1800V RMS (1sec)\nand are intended for industrial communications and controlapplications where very high voltage transients, differentialground potentials, or high noise may be encountered.\nTable 2 lists transformer characteristics for the applica-\ntions of Figures 3–10.  Some suggested manufacturersof transformers, transformer cores, and optocouplersare listed in Table 3, along with their respective phoneand fax numbers.\nImportant layout considerations include:oFor maximum isolation, the “isolation barrier” should not\nbe breached.  Connections and components from oneside should not be located near those of the other side.\noSince the optocoupler outputs are relatively high-\nimpedance nodes, they should be located as closeas possible to the Maxim interface IC.  This mini-mizes stray capacitance and maximizes data rate.  \nRefer to the µMAX package information for pin spacing\nand physical dimensions.\nIsolated RS-485 Data Interface\nThe MAX253 power-supply transformer driver isdesigned specifically for isolated RS-485 data-interfaceapplications.  The application circuits of Figures 3 and 4combine the MAX253 with a low-dropout linear regulator,a transformer, several high-speed optocouplers, and aMaxim RS-485 interface device.  With a few modifica-tions to these circuits, full-duplex communications canbe implemented by substituting the MAX481/MAX485with the MAX490/MAX491 (for data rates up to 2.5Mbps)or substituting the MAX483/MAX487 with theMAX488/MAX489 (for data rates up to 250kbps).  \nThe data transfer rates of the application circuits in\nFigures 3 and 4 are critically limited by the optocou-plers.  Table 1 lists suggested optocouplers and theappropriate Maxim interface device for data-transfer\nrates up to 2.5Mbps.\nRefer to the MAX1480 data sheet for a complete isolat-\ned RS-485 solution in one package.\nIsolated RS-232 Data Interface\nThe MAX253 is ideal for isolated RS-232 data-interfaceapplications requiring more than four transceivers.  The1W power output capability of the MAX253 enables it todrive more than 10 transceivers simultaneously.  Figure 5shows the typical application circuit for a complete120kbps isolated RS-232 data interface.  The figurealso shows how the Sharp PC417 optocouplers can bereplaced by the lower-cost 4N25 devices to achievedata-transfer rates up to 9.6kbps. \nFor 3.3V operation, substitute the primary portion of\nFigure 5 with the circuit of Figure 7.\nFor applications requiring two transceivers or fewer,\nrefer to the MAX250/MAX251 or MAX252 data sheet.\nIsolated Power Supplies\nThe MAX253 is a versatile isolated power driver, capa-ble of driving a center-tapped transformer primary froma 5V or a 3.3V DC power supply (Figures 6 and 7).  Thesecondary can be wound to provide any isolated volt-age needed at power levels up to 1W with a 5V supply,or 600mW with a 3.3V supply.  Figure 6 shows a typical5V to isolated 5V application circuit that delivers up to200mA of isolated 5V power.\nIn Figure 7, the MAX253 is configured to operate from a\n3.3V supply, deriving a “boost” V\nCCfor the MAX253 by\nconnecting diodes to both ends of the transformer pri-mary.  This produces nearly double the input supply,and may be useful for other applications, as shown inFigure 4.  The average current in each MAX253 switchmust still be limited to less than 200mA, so the totalpower available is approximately 600mW. \nTable 1.

Typical 4mA to 20mA Application Circuit\nOutput-Ripple Filtering\nA simple lowpass pi-filter (Figures 6 and 7) can be added\nto the output to reduce output ripple noise to approximately 10mVp-p.  The cutoff frequency shown is 21kHz.  Since thefilter inductor is in series with the circuit output, minimize itsresistance so the voltage drop across it is not excessive.\nIsolated 4mA to 20mA Analog Interface\nThe 4mA to 20mA current loop is a standard analogsignal range that is widely used in the process-controlindustry for transducer and actuator control signals.These signals are commonly referred to a distantground that may be at a considerably higher voltagewith respect to the local ground.\nAn analog signal in the range of 0.1V to 0.5V is applied\nto the first MAX480 to generate a signal current in therange of 20µA to 100µA.  This low-level signal is trans-ferred across the barrier by the Siemens IL300 linearoptocoupler.  This device is unique in that it correctsthe dominant nonlinearity present in most optocou-plers— the LED efficiency variation. The IL300 is really\ntwo optocouplers in the same package sharing the sameLED; one detector is across the isolation barrier, theother is on the same side as the LED (Figure 8).  The lat-ter detector is used to generate a feedback signal identi-cal to the signal on the isolated side of the barrier.  Thecurrent signal transferred across the barrier is convertedback to a voltage that matches the input in the 100mV to500mV range.

A 12V supplycould be generated by adding two more diodes to theends of the secondary, and a -5V supply could be gen-erated by connecting additional diodes to the 1/4 and3/4 tap points on the secondary.  For 5V only applica-tions, the MAX187 is recommended.\nComponent Selection\nTransformer Selection\nThe transformer primary used with the MAX253 must bea center-tapped winding with sufficient ET product toprevent saturation at the worst-case lowest selectedfrequency.  The MAX253’s guaranteed minimum fre-quency with the FS pin held low is 150kHz, equating toa maximum period of 6.67µs.  The required ET productfor half the primary is simply the product of the maxi-\nmum supply voltage and half the maximum period.With FS connected high, the guaranteed minimum fre-quency is 250kHz, giving a maximum period of 4µs.\nThe secondary winding may or may not be center\ntapped, depending on the rectifier topology used.  Thephasing of the secondary winding is not critical.  Insome applications, multiple secondaries might berequired.  Half-wave rectification could be used, but isdiscouraged because it normally adds a DC imbalanceto the magnetic flux in the core, reducing the ET prod-uct.  If the DC load is imbalanced, full-wave rectificationis recommended, as shown in Figure 9b.\nThe transformer turns ratio must be set to provide the\nminimum required output voltage at the maximumanticipated load with the minimum expected input volt-\nTable 2.

In addition, include in the calculations an\nallowance for worst-case losses in the rectifiers.  Sincethe turns ratio determined in this manner will ordinarilyproduce a much higher voltage at the secondary underconditions of high input voltage and/or light loading, becareful to prevent an overvoltage condition from occur-ring (see Output Voltage vs. Load Current in the \nTypical\nOperating Characteristics ).\nTransformers used with the MAX253 will ordinarily be\nwound on high-permeability magnetic material.  To min-imize radiated noise, use common closed-magnetic-path physical shapes (e.g., pot cores, toroids, E/I/Ucores).  A typical core is the Philips 213CT050-3B7,which is a toroid 0.190” in diameter and 0.05” thick.For operation with this core at 5.5V maximum supplyvoltage, the primary should have approximately 22turns on each side of the center tap, or 44 turns total.This will result in a nominal primary inductance ofapproximately 832µH.  The secondary can be scaled toproduce the required DC output.\nDiode Selection\nThe MAX253’s high switching frequency demandshigh-speed rectifiers.  Schottky diodes are recom-mended.  Ensure that the Schottky diode average cur-rent rating exceeds the load-current level.  The 1N5817is a good choice for through-hole applications, and the\nNIEC* SB05W05C dual in an SOT-23 package is rec-ommended for surface-mount applications.  Use thehigher frequency setting to reduce ripple.\nOutput Filter Capacitor\nIn applications sensitive to output-ripple noise, the out-put filter capacitor C2 should have a low effectiveseries resistance (ESR), and its capacitance shouldremain fairly constant over temperature.  Sprague 595Dsurface-mount solid tantalum capacitors and SanyoOS-CON through-hole capacitors are recommendeddue to their extremely low ESR.  Capacitor ESR usuallyrises at low temperatures, but OS-CON capacitors pro-vide very low ESR below 0°C.\nIn applications where output ripple is not critical, a\n0.1µF chip or ceramic capacitor is sufficient.  Refer toTable 4 for suggested capacitor suppliers.  Use thehigher frequency setting to reduce ripple.\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nThe input bypass capacitor C1 is not critical.  Unlikeswitching regulators, the MAX253’s supply current isfairly constant, and is therefore less dependent on theinput bypass capacitor.  A low-cost 0.1µF chip orceramic capacitor is normally sufficient for inputbypassing.\n* Nihon Inter Electronics Corp.\nUSA Phone:  (805) 867-2555\nFAX:  (805) 867-2556\nJapan Phone:  81-3-3494-7411\nFAX:  81-3-3494-7414Table 4.
