Power supply circuitry\nPrimary Side Supply Monitoring：\nThe supply voltage V CC is monitored on the primary-side \nfor undervoltage lockout. When V CC drops to the UVLO set \nfault threshold V CCUV+ , UVLO is triggered, two secondary-\nside gate drive outputs are locked in off state and keep \nthe IGBT off. Meanwhile, the fault signal SO1 and SO2 are \npulled down. \nWhen V CC returns to the UVLO clear fault threshold V CCUVR+ , \nthe driver continues to maintain the lockout state for a \nperiod t B, then exits the lockout state and pulls up fault \nsignals SOx.\nFigure 7. Primary-side UVLO logic\nSecondary Side Supply Monitoring：\nThe secondary power supply voltage is also monitored \nto ensure a safe IGBT switching. To demonstrate the \nbehavior of the secondary side UVLO, a scenario is \nconsidered in below where the primary side supply \nvoltage V CC decreases from the nominal value towards \nzero:\n1) At first the positive voltage V+ (VISO to VE) is held \nconstant on the nominal value, while the negative voltage \nV- (COM to VE) deviates from the nominal value towards \nzero along with the decreasing V CC. 2) As soon as V- reaches -5V, V- is held constant and V+ \nstarts to fall towards zero if V CC further collapses.\n3) When V+ reaches the set fault threshold V UV+, UVLO \nprotection is initiated. The IGBT is turned off and held in \noff state, meanwhile a set fault signal is transmitted to the \nprimary side and asserts SOx pin immediately. \n4) The counting of t B starts when a UV fault is detected. \nThis is different from the primary side supply voltage \nmonitoring, where the counting of t B starts after UV \nfault is cleared. If a new fault is detected before t B of the \nprevious fault elapses, t B is recounted from the new fault. \n5) When Vcc rises again, the driver firstly restores V+.\n6) If V+ further increases and reaches its nominal value, \nV+ is held constant and V- starts to recover towards its \nnominal value.\nFigure 8. Secondary-side UVLO logic\nInput Signal\nThe triggering signal is input from INx port. The turn-on \nthreshold V INH and turn-off threshold V INL are defined by \ndifferent resistor configurations on the driver board.\nFigure 9. INx input circuitry\nTransmission Logic and Mode Selection\nThe driver can be configured as direct or half-bridge \nmode. Operating mode of the driver can be configured by \nthe MOD pin connection.

A logic high turns on the \ncorresponding IGBT , while a logic low turns it off. \nNote: In direct mode, make sure to add a proper dead \ntime in the input signals to avoid shoot-through of the \ntwo switches in a bridge.\nFigure 10. Transmission logic in direct mode\nHalf-Bridge Mode：\nIf the MOD pin is shorted to ground, the driver operates in \nhalf-bridge mode. In this mode, IN1 serves as PWM signal \nand IN2 as enabling signal. \nWhen IN2 is low, both channels are locked in off state. If \nIN2 is high, both channels are enabled. The gate output \nsignals of both channels are determined by IN1. At the \ntransition of IN1 from low to high, the gate output of \nChannel 2 is turned off immediately. After a dead time \nDT elapses, the gate output of Channel 1 is turned on. At \nthe transition of IN1 from high to low, the gate output of \nChannel 1 is turned off immediately. After the dead time \nDT elapses, the gate output of Channel 2 is turned on. \nFigure 11. Transmission logic in Half-bridge mode\nStatus Output Signal \nThe output SOx has open-drain transistor on the driver \nboard. 2QP0225TxxA0-xx: \nWhen no fault is detected, Q SOx keeps off,  the outputs \nSOx have high impedance. When a fault is detected, the \ncorresponding SOx is pulled down to ground. \nIt is recommended to mount external pull-up resistors \nas demonstrated in the diagram of recommended user \ninterface of 2QP0225TxxA0-xx. The diodes D SOEx  are only \nrequired when using 3.3V input logic level. For 5V…15V \nlogic, they can be omitted.\nIn a fault condition, the maximum SOx current must not \nexceed 20mA. \nFigure 12. SOx user interface of 2QP0225TxxA0-xx\n2QP0225TxxC0-xx:\nWhen there is no fault, Q SOx keeps off, and each of the \nSOx is pulled up to VCC via a resistor on the driver board. \nWhen a fault is detected, the corresponding SOx is pulled \ndown to ground. It is recommended to assemble external \npull down resistors R SOEx  to ground as demonstrated \nin the diagram of recommended user interface of \n2QP0225TxxC0-xx, which allows a missing SOx connection \nto be detected (safe logic in the event of a defective \ncable). Note that R SOEx  (pull down resistor on the user's \nboard) must have sufficiently high resistance (e.g. 150 kΩ), \nas they form a voltage divider together with the internal \npull-up resistor (typically 10kΩ) on the driver board.\nSO1 and SO2 can be connected together to provide fault \ninformation of the entire driver. However, for fast and \nprecise fault diagnosis, it is recommended to detect the \ninformation independently.\nFigure 13.

When TB \nis left open, the blocking time is 95ms.\nNote: R TB should not be smaller than 150kΩ, which \nmeans the blocking time t B cannot be shorter than 20ms, \notherwise the blocking time t B will be inaccurate and \nunstable. If TB pin is shorted to ground, t B is fixed to 10us.\nFigure 14. Blocking time setting\nIGBT Turn-on and Turn-off\nTo turn on the IGBT , Q ON is turned on, Q OFF is turned off, \nand then the gate resistor R GON is pulled up to charge the \nIGBT gate. Thus to turn on the IGBT . \nTo turn off the IGBT , Q OFF inside the ASIC of the driver is \nturned on, and Q ON is turned off, the gate resistor Q OFF is \npulled down to discharge the IGBT gate. Thus to turn off  \nthe IGBT . \nFigure 15. Gate drive output circuitry \nActive Clamping\nFast IGBT turn-off may lead to voltage spikes, which is \ncritical when DC-link voltage and load current are high. \nVoltage spikes can cause damage to the IGBT . The turn-off  \nvoltage spike is mainly correlated to the stray inductance \nLS and the slew rate of the IGBT turn-off current di/dt. \nBy adjusting the turn-off gate resistor R GOFF , di/dt can be \nreduced and the voltage overshoot is reduced. However, \nthe impact of L S is inevitable. It can be more pronounced \nunder high current in short circuit or overload. The driver \nis equipped with active clamping function to effectively \nprevent the overvoltage damage on IGBT . Primary side ASICRTBTBTB\n150k\n2QP0225Txx\nGND GNDA feedback path from the IGBT collector to the gate is \nestablished using transient voltage suppressor devices \n(TVS). When the V CE peak voltage exceeds the breakdown \nthreshold, the TVS chain will break through and the \ncurrent through it will charge the IGBT gate, which turns \non the IGBT partially and suppresses the excessive V CE of \nthe IGBT .\nFigure 16. Active clamping circuitry\nIGBT Short-Circuit Protection\nThe V CE detection circuitry is used for IGBT short- \ncircuit protection. The detection of two channels are \nindependent from each other. The short-circuit detection \nis only valid when the IGBT is turned on. When the IGBT \nis in off state, the input signal turns on Q CEx and clamps \nVCEDTx  to COMx. In this case, the comparator outputs logic \nlow.\nFigure 17. Short-circuit protection circuitry\nNormal Turn-On：\nWhen the logic input will turn on the IGBT , Q CE is firstly \nturned off and releases the clamping of V CEDTx . At this \nmoment, IGBT is still in off state and V CE is high. C Ax \ncapacitor is charged through the resistor R Ax, V CEDTx  \nrises. Then the IGBT is turned on, V CE quickly drops to \nsaturation voltage V CE-SAT  and V CEDTx  reaches V CE-SAT . \nAs V CE-SAT  is significantly lower than the protection \nthreshold V REF, the comparator does not flip over and the \nprotection is not initiated.Secondary side ASIC\nVISOxQONVISOx\nCOMxExGxGH\nGLRGON\nRGOFFQOFF\nVExCOMxVISOx\nVEx\nDriver\nDriver4.7k\nCOMx 2QP0225 TxxPart Number IGBT VoltageTVS Chain Breakdown \nThreshold @ 25℃\n2QP0225T12xx 1200V 912V\n2QP0225T17xx 1700V 1320V\n Secondary side ASIC\nRGOFFx\nVExQOFF\nCOMxGLQOFF \nTurn -off Logic\nActive ClampingRGONxRACLx ACLTVS\nExCx\nGx\n2QP0225 TxxVISOx\n Secondary side ASIC\n-\n+Protection\nLogicDVCEN DVCE1\nQCEVISOx\nExCx\nVEx\nCOMxCAxRAx\nCOMx150uAVEx\nRREF\nVREF\nVCEDTx\n2QP0225 TxxGxRTB[ms] =8250+150·t B[ms]\n95-t B[ms]\n（R TB≥ 150kΩ, 20ms ≤ t B≤ 95ms）2QP0225Txx\nwww.qtjtec.com\n9/14 Copyright:©Shenzhen Bronze Technologies Ltd 10-Oct-2023  V1.0\nClass II Short-Circuit Protection: \nWhen a Class II short circuit (e.g. phase to phase short \ncircuit) occurs, the current ramps up slowly as the short \ncircuit impedance is relatively high. The IGBT still enters \nsaturation state normally. As the short-circuit current \nincreases, V CE increases gradually until it exceeds the \nprotection threshold, then the driver initiate short-circuit \nprotection. The response time in Class II short-circuit \nprotection is longer than that of Class I.\nIn another case, if bridge shoot-through occurs under low \nDC-link voltage, the short circuit current is low and also \nresulting in increased protection response time. \nNote: When a Class II short circuit occurs, the short circuit \nimpedance varies greatly, which leads to uncertain timing \nof IGBT desaturation. Therefore, before the protection is \ninitiated, the IGBT may have been already damaged by \na considerable sum of heat accumulated. In this case, \nthe driver's short-circuit protection cannot guarantee \nthe intactness of the IGBT . Extra overcurrent protection \nmeasures have to be introduced.\nFigure 20. Class II short-circuit protection  \nSoft Shut Down \nDue to the stray inductance, excessive voltage spikes are \ngenerated when the short-circuit of IGBT is turned off. In \norder to suppress voltage spikes without affecting the \nspeed of turn-off during normal operation, it is necessary \nto deploy soft shut down function. \nThe secondary-side ASIC of the driver has an embedded \nsoft shut down function. When fault condition is detected, \nsoft shut down function is activate to protect the IGBT . Figure 18. Signal waveform at normal turn-on\nClass I Short-Circuit Protection：\nWhen Class I short circuit (bridge shoot-through) occurs, \ndue to the rapid increase of the short cirucit current, \nthe IGBT desaturates and result in rapidly increased \nVCE. C Ax is charged and V CEDTx  rises until it is clamped at \nVISOx. During this process, V CEDTx  exceeds V REF and the \ncomparator's output flips, which consequently triggers \nthe short-circuit protection. \nThe short-circuit protection logic turns off the IGBT \nimmediately to ensure its safety. At the same time, set \nfault signal is sent to the primary side to pull down the \nSOx pin, so as to alert a fault state. The channel is locked \nin fault state for a period t B before recovering to the \nnormal state. \nThe protection circuits of the two channels are \nindependent from each other. Therefore, when short- \ncircuit protection is initiated on one channel, the other \nchannel remains operating normally. It is recommended \nto check the SOx signal timely and activate system \nlockout when necessary.\nFigure 19.

As the gate votlage is \nunchanged, there is a difference between V GH and V REF_ \nSSD, thus the hysteresis comparator generates a positive \noutput.\n3) The Q OFF is turned on by the comparator output, \nthe gate voltage and V GH gradually drop. When V GH \ndrops too fast, so that V GH becomes lower than V REF_ \nSDD, Q OFF is turned off untill V REF_SDD  falls below V GH.
