It contains a low \nnoise 24-bit ∑-Δ ADC with one differential input that can be \nbuffered or unbuffered. \nThe device operates from an internal clock. Therefore, the user \ndoes not have to supply a clock source to the device. The output \ndata rate from the part is software programmable and can be \nvaried from 9.5 Hz to 120 Hz, with the rms noise equal to 1.1 μV at the lower update rate. The internal clock frequency can be divided by a factor of 2, 4, or 8, which leads to a reduc-tion in the current consumption.  The update rate, cutoff fre-frequency, and settling time will scale with the clock frequency. \nThe part operates with a power supply from 2.5 V to 5.25 V . \nWhen operating from a 3 V supply, the power dissipation for \nthe part is 225 μW maximum. It is housed in a 10-lead MSOP .  \n \n \nAD7791  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

All input signals are specified with t R = t F = 5 ns (10% to 90% of V DD) and timed from a voltage level of 1.6 V.  \n2 See Figure 3 and Figure 4.  \n3 These n umbers are measured with the load circuit of Figure 2 and defined as the time required for the output to cross the V OL or V OH limits.  \n4 SCLK active edge is falling edge of SCLK.  \n5 These numbers are derived from the measured time taken by the data output to change 0.5 V when loaded with the circuit of Figure 2. The measured number is then \nextrapo lated back to remove the effects of charging or discharging the 50 pF capacitor. This means that the times quoted in the timing characteristics are the true bus \nrelinquish times of the part and, as such, are independent of external bus loading capacitances.  \n6 RDY  returns high after a read of the ADC. In single conversion mode and continuous convers ion mode, the same data can be read again, if required, while RDY  is high, \nalthough care should be taken to ensure that subsequent reads do not occur close to the next output update. In continuous rea d mode, the digital word can be read \nonly once.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAD7791 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

A | Page 10 of 20 ON-CHIP REGISTERS  \nThe ADC is controlled and configured via a number of on -chip registers, which are described on the following pages. In t he following \ndescriptions, set implies a Logic 1 state and cleared  implies a Logic 0 state, unless otherwise stated.  \nCOMMUNICATIONS REGISTER (RS1, RS0 = 0, 0)  \nThe communications register is an 8 -bit write -only register. All communications to the part must start with a write operation to the \ncommunications register. The data written to the communications register determines whether the next operation is a read or w rite ope r-\nation, and to which register this operation takes place. For read or write operation s, once the subsequent read or write operation to the \nselected register is complete, the interface returns to where it expects a write operation to the communications register. Th is is the default \nstate of the interface and, on power -up or after a reset, t he ADC is in this default state waiting for a write operation to the communic a-\ntions regi ster. In situations where the interface sequence is lost, a write operation of at least 32 serial clock cycles with DIN high r eturns \nthe ADC to this default state by re setting the entire part. Table 5 outlines the bit designations for the communications register. CR0 \nthrough CR7 indicate the bit location, CR denoting the bits are in the communications register. CR7 denotes the first bit of the da ta \nstream. The nu mber in brackets indicates the power -on/reset default status of that bit.  \n \nCR7  CR6  CR5  CR4  CR3  CR2  CR1  CR0  \nWEN (0) 0(0)  RS1(0)  RS0(0)  R/W(0)  CREAD(0)  CH1(0)  CH0(0)  \nTable 5.  Communications Register Bit Designations  \nBit Location  Bit Name  Description  \nCR7  WEN  Write Enable Bit. A 0 must be written to this bit so that the write to the communications register actually \noccurs. If a 1 is the first bit written, the part will not clock on to subsequent bits in the register. It will stay \nat this bit location until a 0 is written to this bit. Once a 0 is written to the WEN  bit, the next seven bits \nwill be loaded to the communications register.  \nCR6 0 This bit must be programmed to Logic 0 for correct operation.  \nCR5 –CR4  RS1–RS0 Register Address Bits. These address bits are used to select which of the ADC’s registers are being selec t-\ned during this serial interface communication. See Table 6.  \nCR3  R/W A 0 in this bit location indicates that the next operation will be a write to a specified register. A 1 in this \nposition indicates that the next operation will be a read from the designated register.  \nCR2  CREAD Continuous Read of the Data Register. When this bit is set to 1 (and the data register is selected), the serial interface is configured so that the data register can be continuously read, i.e., the contents of the \ndata register are placed on the DOUT p in automatically when the SCLK pulses are applied. The commu -\nnications register does not have to be written to for data reads. To enable continuous read mode, the \ninstruction 001111XX must be written to the communications register. To exit the continuous r ead \nmode, the instruction 001110XX must be written to the communications register while the \nRDY  pin is \nlow. While in continuous read mode, the ADC monitors activity on the DIN line so that it can receive the \ninstruction to exit continuous  read mode. Additionally, a reset will occur if 32 co nsecutive 1s are seen on \nDIN. Therefore, DIN should be held low in continuous read mode until an instruction is to be written to \nthe device.  \nCR1 –CR0  CH1 –CH0  These bits are used to select the analog in put channel. The differential channel can be selected \n(AIN(+)/AIN( –)) or an internal short (AIN( –)/AIN( –)) can be selected. Alternatively, the power supply can \nbe selected, i.e., the ADC can measure the voltage on the power supply, which is useful for monitoring \npower supply variation. The power supply voltage is divided by 5 and then applied to the modulator for \nconversion. The ADC uses a 1.17 V ± 5% on -chip reference as the reference source for the analog to dig i-\ntal conversion. Any change in channel reset s the filter and a new conversion is started. \n \nTable 6.

A | Page 14 of 20 ADC CIRCUIT INFORMATION  \nOVERVIEW  \nThe AD7791 is a low power ADC that incorporates a ∑-Δ mod-\nulator, a buffer and on-chip digital filtering intended for the \nmeasurement of wide dynamic range, low frequency signals such as those in pressure transducers, weigh scales, and temper-ature measurement applications.  \nThe part has one differential input that can be buffered or  \nunbuffered. Buffering the input channel means that the part can \naccommodate significant source impedances on the analog \ninput and that R, C filtering (for noise rejection or RFI reduc-\ntion) can be placed on the analog input, if required. The device requires an external reference of 2.5 nominal. Figure 12 shows \nthe basic connections required to operate the part.  \n \n04227-0-006IN+10\uf06dF 0.1\uf06dF\nIN–OUT–POWER\nSUPPLY\nOUT+REFIN(+)\nCS\nDOUT/RDY\nSCLKVDD\nGNDAIN(+)\nAIN(–)\nREFIN(–)AD7791\nMICROCONTROLLER\n \nFigure 12.  Basic Connection Diagram \n \nThe output rate of the AD7791 (f ADC) is user programmable \nwith the settling time equal to 2 × t ADC. Normal mode rejection \nis the major function of the digital filter. Table 12 lists the avail-\nable output rates from the AD7791. Simultaneous 50 Hz and 60 Hz rejection is optimized when the update rate equals \n16.6 Hz as notches are placed at both 50 Hz and 60 Hz with this \nupdate rate (see Figure 6).  \nNOISE PERFORMANCE  \nTable 13 shows the output rms noise, rms resolution, and peak-\nto-peak resolution (rounded to the nearest 0.5 LSB) for the  \ndifferent update rates and input ranges for the AD7791. The  numbers given are for the bipolar input range with a reference \nof 2.5 V . These numbers are typical and generated with a differ-\nential input voltage of 0 V . The peak-to-peak resolution figures represent the resolution for which there will be no code flicker within a six-sigma limit. The output noise comes from two sources. The first is the electrical noise in the semiconductor \ndevices (device noise) used in the implementation of the modu-\nlator. The second is quantization noise, which is added when the analog input is converted into the digital domain. The de-vice noise is at a low level and is independent of frequency. The quantization noise starts at an even lower level but rises rapidly \nwith increasing frequency to become the dominant noise \nsource.  \n \nTable 13.

The clock frequency \ncan be divided by a factor of 2, 4, or 8 before being applied to the modulator and filter, resulting in a reduction in the current consumption of the AD7791.  Bits CDIV1 and CDIV0 in the filter \nregister are used to enter these low power modes (see Table 14).  \nWhen the internal clock is reduced, the update rate will also be \nreduced. For example, if the filter bits are set to give an update \nrate of 16.6 Hz when the AD7791 is operated in full power \nmode, the update rate will equal 8.3 Hz in divide by 2 mode. In \nthe low power modes, there may be some degradation in the \nADC performance. \n \nTable 14.

A | Page 15 of 20 DIGITAL INTERFACE  \nAs previously outlined, the AD7791’s programmable functions \nare controlled using a set of on-chip registers. Data is written to \nthese registers via the part’s serial interface and read access to the on-chip registers is also provided by this interface. All \ncommunications with the part must start with a write to the \ncommunications register. After power-on or reset, the device expects a write to its communications register. The data written to this register determines whether the next operation is a read operation or a write operation and also determines to which register this read or write operation occurs. Therefore, write \naccess to any of the other registers on the part begins with a \nwrite operation to the communications register followed by a write to the selected register. A read operation from any other register (except when continuous read mode is selected) starts with a write to the communications register followed by a read operation from the selected register.  \nThe AD7791’s serial interface consists of four signals: CS\n, DIN, \nSCLK, and DOUT/ RDY . The DIN line is used to transfer data \ninto the on-chip registers while DOUT/ RDY  is used for access-\ning from the on-chip registers. SCLK is the serial clock input for \nthe device and all data transfers (either on DIN or DOUT/ RDY ) \noccur with respect to the SCLK signal. The DOUT/ RDY  pin \noperates as a Data Ready signal also, the line going low when a new data-word is available in the output register. It is reset high \nwhen a read operation from the data register is complete. It also \ngoes high prior to the updating of the data register to indicate when not to read from the device to ensure that a data read is \nnot attempted while the register is being updated. CS\n is used to \nselect a device. It can be used to decode the AD7791 in systems where several components are connected to the serial bus.  \nFigure 3 and Figure 4 show timing diagrams for interfacing to \nthe AD7791 with CS\n being used to decode the part. Figure 3 \nshows the timing for a read operation from the AD7791’s out-\nput  shift register while Figure 4 shows the timing for a write opera-\ntion to the input shift register. In all modes except continuous \nread mode, it is possible to read the same word from the data \nregister several times even though the DOUT/ RDY  line returns \nhigh after the first read operation. However, care must be taken \nto ensure that the read operations have been completed before the next output update occurs. In continuous read mode, the \ndata register can be read only once.  \nThe serial interface can operate in 3-wire mode by tying CS\n low. \nIn this case, the SCLK, DIN, and DOUT/ RDY  lines are used to \ncommunicate with the AD7791. The end of the conversion can \nbe monitored using the RDY  bit in the status register. This \nscheme is suitable for interfacing to microcontrollers. If CS is \nrequired as a decoding signal, it can be generated from a port pin. For microcontroller interfaces, it is recommended that SCLK idles high between data transfers.  \nThe AD7791 can be operated with CS\n being used as a frame \nsynchronization signal. This scheme is useful for DSP interfac-\nes. In this case, the first bit (MSB) is effectively clocked out by \nCS since CS would normally occur after the falling edge of \nSCLK in DSPs. The SCLK can continue to run between data \ntransfers, provided the timing numbers are obeyed.  \nThe serial interface can be reset by writing a series of 1s on the \nDIN input. If a Logic 1 is written to the AD7791 line for at least 32 serial clock cycles, the serial interface is reset. This ensures \nthat in 3-wire systems, the interface can be reset to a known state if the interface gets lost due to a software error or some glitch in the system. Reset returns the interface to the state in which it is expecting a write to the communications register. This operation resets the contents of all registers to their power-on values.  \nThe AD7791 can be configured to continuously convert or to \nperform a single conversion.

A | Page 16 of 20 Single Conversion Mode  \nIn single conversion mode, the AD7791 is placed in shutdown \nmode between conversions. When a single conversion is initia t-\ned by setting MD1 to 1 and MD0 to 0 in the mode register, the AD7791 powers up, performs a single conversion, and then \nreturns to shutdown mode. A conversion will require a time \nperiod of 2 × t\nADC. DOUT/ RDY  goes low to ind icate the co m-\npletion of a conversion. When the data -word has been read \nfrom the data register, DOUT/ RDY  will go high. If CS is low, \nDOUT/ RDY  will remain high until a nother conve rsion is init i-\nated and co mpleted. The data register can be read several times, \nif required, even when DOUT/ RDY  has gone high.  Continuous Conversion Mode  \nThis is the default power -up mode. The AD7791 will contin u-\nously convert, the RDY  pin in t he status register going low each \ntime a conversion is complete. If CS is low, the DOUT/ RDY  line \nwill also go low when a conversion is co mplete. To read a co n-\nversion, the user can write to the co mmunications register, \nindicating that the next operation is a read of the data register. \nThe digital conversion will be placed on the DOUT/ RDY  pin as \nsoon as SCLK pulses are applied to the ADC. DOUT/ RDY  will \nreturn high when the conversion is r ead. The user can read this \nregister additional times, if r equired. However, the user must \nensure that the data register is not being accessed at the compl e-\ntion of the next conversion or else the new conversion word will \nbe lost.  \n \n04227-0-009DIN\nSCLKDOUT/RDYCS\n0x38 0x38\nDATA DATA\n \nFigure 14.  Continuous Conversion  \n \nData Sheet AD7791\n \nRev. A | Page 17 of 20 Continuous Read Mode \nRather than write to the communications register each time a \nconversion is complete to access the data, the AD7791 can be \nplaced in continuous read mode. By writing 001111XX to the \ncommunications register, the user needs only to apply the appropriate number of SCLK cycles to the ADC and the 24-bit \nword will automatically be placed on the DOUT/ RDY\n line \nwhen a conversion is complete.  \nWhen DOUT/ RDY  goes low to indicate the end of a conver-\nsion, sufficient SCLK cycles must be applied to the ADC and \nthe data conversion will be placed on the DOUT/ RDY  line. \nWhen the conversion is read, DOUT/ RDY  will return high \nuntil the next conversion is available. In this mode, the data can be read only once. Also, the user must ensure that the data-\nword is read  before the next conversion is complete. If the user has not read \nthe conversion before the completion of the next conversion or \nif insufficient serial clocks are applied to the AD7791 to read the word, the serial output register is reset when the next con-version is complete and the new conversion is placed in the \noutput serial register.  \nTo exit the continuous read mode, the instruction 001110XX \nmust be written to the communications register while the RDY\n \npin is low. While in the continuous read mode, the ADC moni-tors activity on the DIN line so that it can receive the instruction to exit the continuous read mode. Additionally, a reset will occur if 32 consecutive 1s are seen on DIN. Therefore, \nDIN should be held low in continuous read mode until an in-\nstruction is to be written to the device. \n \n04227-0-008DIN\nSCLKDOUT/RDYCS\n0x3C\nDATA DATA DATA\n \nFigure 15.  Continuous Read \n \n \nAD7791  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 18 of 20 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nANALOG INPUT CHANNEL  \nThe AD7791 has one differential analog input channel. This is \nconnected to the on -chip buffer amplifier when the device is \noperated in buffered mode and directly to the modulator when the device is operated in unbuffered mode. In buffered mode (the BUF bit in the mode register is set to 1), the input channel \nfeeds into a high impedance input stage of the buffer amplifier. \nTherefore, the input can tolerate significant source impedances and is tailored for direct connection to external re sistive -type \nsensors such as strain gauges or resistance temperature dete c-\ntors (RTDs).  \nWhen BUF = 0, the part is operated in unbuffered mode. This results in a higher analog input current. Note that this unbuffered input path provides a dynamic load to th e dri ving \nsource. Therefore, resistor/capacitor combinations on the input pins can cause dc gain errors, depending on the output impedance of the source that is driving the ADC input. Table 15 \nshows the allowable external resistanc e/capacitance values for \nunbuffered mode such that no gain error at the 20 -bit level is \nintroduced.  \n \nTable 15.  External R-C Combination for No 20-Bit Gain Error  \nC (pF) R (Ω)  \n50 16.7K  \n100 9.6K  \n500 2.2K  \n1000  1.1K  \n5000  160 \n \nThe absolute input voltage range in buffered mode is restricted \nto a range between GND + 100 mV and V DD – 100 mV . Care \nmust be taken in setting up the common -mode voltage so that \nthese limits are not exceeded. Otherwise, there will be degrad a-\ntion in linearity  and noise performance.  \nThe absolute input voltage in unbuffered mode includes the \nrange between GND –  30 mV and V DD + 30 mV as a result of \nbeing unbuffered. The negative absolute input voltage limit does \nallow the possibility of monitoring small true bip olar signals \nwith respect to GND.  \nBIPOLAR/UNIPOLAR CONFIGURATION  \nThe analog input to the AD7791 can accept either unipolar or \nbipolar input voltage ranges. A bipolar input range does not \nimply that the part can tolerate negative voltages with respect to system GND. Unipolar and bipolar signals on the AIN(+) input are referenced to the voltage on the AIN( –) input. For example, \nif AIN( –) is 2.5 V and the ADC is configured for unipolar \nmode, the input voltage range on the AIN(+) pin is 2.5  V  t o  5  V.   If the  ADC is configured for bipolar mode, the analog input \nrange on the AIN(+) input is 0 V to 5 V . The bip olar/unipolar \noption is chosen by programming the B/U bit in the mode \nregister.  \nDATA OUTPUT CODING  \nWhen the ADC is configured for unipolar operation, th e output \ncode is natural (straight) binary with a zero differential input \nvoltage resulting in a code of 00...00, a midscale voltage resulting in a code of 100...000, and a full -scale input voltage \nresulting in a code of 111...111. The output code for any analog \ninput voltage can be represented as  \nCode  = 2\nN × (AIN /VREF) \nWhen the ADC is configured for bipolar operation, the output \ncode is offset binary with a negative full -scale voltage resulting \nin a code of 000...000, a zero differential input voltage res ulting \nin a code of 100...000, and a positive full- scale input voltage \nresulting in a code of 111...111. The output code for any analog \ninput voltage can be represented as  \nCode  = 2N – 1 × [(AIN/VREF) + 1]  \nwhere AIN is the analog input voltage and N  = 24.  \nREFERENCE INPUT  \nThe AD7791 has a fully differential input capability for the \nchannel. The common -mode range for these differential inputs \nis from GND to V DD. The reference input is unbuffered and, \ntherefore, excessive R -C source impedances will introduce  gain \nerrors. The reference voltage REFIN (REFIN(+) –  REFIN( –)) is \n2.5 V nominal, but the AD7791 is functional with reference \nvoltages from 0.1 V to V DD. In applic ations where the excitation \n(voltage or current) for the transducer on the analog input also \ndrives the reference voltage for the part, the effect of the low \nfrequency noise in the excitation source will be removed \nbecause the a pplication is ratiometric. If the AD7791 is used \nin a nonratiometric applic ation, a low noise reference should \nbe used.  \nRecommended 2.5 V reference voltage sources for the AD7791 \ninclude the ADR381 and ADR391, which are low noise, low \npower references. In a system that operates from a 2.5 V power \nsupply, the reference voltage source will require some hea d-\nroom. In this case , a 2.048 V reference such as the ADR380 can \nbe used, requiring only 300 mV of headroom. Also note that the reference inputs provide a high impedance, dynamic load. Because the input impedance of each reference input is dynamic, resistor/ capacitor combina tions on these inputs can \ncause dc gain errors, depending on the output impedance of the source that is driving the reference inputs.  \nData Sheet  AD7791  \n \nRev. A | Page 1 9 of 20 Reference voltage sources like those recommended above \n(e.g., ADR391) will typically have low output impedances and \nare, therefore, tolerant to having decoupling capacitors on \nREFIN(+) without introducing gain errors in the system. Deriving the reference input voltage across an external resistor \nwill mean that the re ference input sees a significant external \nsource impedance . External decoupling on the REFIN pins \nwould not be recommended in this type of circuit \nconfiguration.  \nVDD MONITOR  \nAlong with converting external voltages, the analog input cha n-\nnel can be used to monitor the voltage on the V DD pin. When \nthe CH1 and CH0 bits in the communications register are set to 1, the voltage on the V\nDD pin is internally attenuated by 5 and \nthe resultant voltage is applied to the ∑ -∆ modulator using an \ninternal 1.17 V reference for analog to digital conversion. This \nis useful because  variations in the power supply voltage can be \nmon itored.  \nGROUNDING AND LAYOUT  \nSince the analog inputs and reference inputs of the ADC are \ndifferential, most of the voltages in the analog modulator are \ncommon -mode voltages. The excellent common -mode reje c-\ntion of the part will remove common -mode noise on these \ninputs. The digital filter will provide rejection of broadband noise on the power supply, except at integer multiples of the modulator sampling frequency. The digital filter also removes noise from t he analog and reference inputs, provided that these \nnoise sources do not saturate the analog modulator. As a result, the AD7791 is more immune to noise interference than a co n-\nventional high resolution converter. However, because the resolution of the AD779 1 is so high, and the noise levels from \nthe AD7791 are so low, care must be taken with regard to grounding and layout.  The printed circuit board that houses the AD7791 should be designed such that the analog and digital sections are separated \nand confined  to certain areas of the board. A minimum etch \ntechnique is generally best for ground planes because it gives the best shielding.  \nIt is recommended that the AD7791’s GND pin be tied to the AGND plane of the system. In any layout, it is important that \nthe user keep in mind the flow of currents in the system, ensu r-\ning that the return paths for all currents are as close as possible \nto the paths the currents took to reach their destinations. Avoid \nforcing digital currents to flow through the AGND sections of \nthe layout.  \nThe AD7791’s ground plane should be allowed to run under the AD7791 to prevent noise coupling. The power supply lines to \nthe AD7791 should use as wide a trace as possible to provide \nlow impedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals such as clocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board, and clock signals should never be run near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital and analog \nsignals. Traces on opposite sides of the board should run at \nright angles to each other. This will reduce the effects of feed-\nthrough through the board. A microstrip technique is by far the best, but it is not always possible with a double -sided board. In \nthis technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to \nground planes, while signals are placed on the solder side.  \nGood decoupling is important when using high resolution ADCs. V\nDD should be decoupled with 10 µF tantalum in parallel \nwith 0.1 µF capacitors to GND. To achieve the best from these decoupling components, they should be placed as close as possible to the device, ideally right up against the device. All logic chips should be decoupled with 0.1 µF ceramic capacitors to DGND. \n \n \n \nAD7791  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.
