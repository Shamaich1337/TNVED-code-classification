Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: Absolute maximum input-to-output differential voltage is not \nachievable with all combinations of rated IN pin and OUT pin voltages. With the IN pin at 45V, the OUT pin may not be pulled below 0V. The total IN to OUT differential voltage must not exceed ±45V.Note 3: The LT3086 is tested and specified under pulse load conditions such that T\nJ ≅ T A. The LT3086E is 100% production tested at T A = 25°C \nand performance is guaranteed from 0°C to 125°C. Specifications over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The LT3086I is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The LT3086MP is 100% tested over the –55°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The LT3086H is 100% tested \nLT30865\n3086fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3086at the 150°C operating junction temperature. High junction temperatures \ndegrade operating lifetimes. Operating lifetime is derated at junction temperatures greater than 125°C.\nNote 4: The LT3086 is tested and specified for these conditions with the \nSET pin connected to the OUT pin, V\nOUT = 0.4V.\nNote 5: Maximum junction temperature limits operating conditions. The regulated output voltage specification does not apply for all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. Limit the output current range if operating at large input-to-output voltage differentials. Limit the input-to-output voltage differential if operating at maximum output current. Current limit foldback limits the maximum output current as a function of input-to-output voltage. See Current Limit vs V\nIN – V OUT in the \nTypical Performance Characteristics section.\nNote 6: Load regulation is Kelvin-sensed at the package.Note 7: To  satisfy minimum input voltage requirements, the LT3086 is \ntested and specified for these conditions with a 32k resistor between OUT \nand SET for a 2V output voltage.\nNote 8: Dropout voltage is the minimum input-to-output voltage \ndifferential needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, the output voltage equals: (V\nIN – V DROPOUT ). For low output \nvoltages and certain load conditions, minimum input voltage requirements limit dropout voltage. See the Minimum Input V\noltage curve in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics section.\nNote 9: GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  + 0.55V and \nPWRGD pin floating. GND pin current increases in dropout. See GND pin \ncurrent curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nNote 10: SHDN pin current flows into the SHDN pin.Note 11: Reverse-output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and \nthe OUT pin forced to a voltage. The current flows into the OUT pin and out of the GND pin.\nNote 12: The IC includes overtemperature protection circuitry that protects \nthe device during momentary overload conditions. Junction temperature exceeds 125°C (LT3086E, LT3086I, LT3086MP) or 150°C (LT3086H) when the overtemperature circuitry is active unless thermal limit is externally set by loading the TEMP pin. Continuous operation above the specified maximum junction temperature may impair device reliability.\nNote 13: The TEMP output voltage represents the average die temperature \nnext to the power transistor while the center of the transistor can be significantly hotter during high power conditions. Due to power dissipation and temperature gradients across the die, the TEMP output voltage \nmeasurement  does not guarantee that absolute maximum junction \ntemperature is not exceeded.\nNote 14:\n Output current sharing error is the difference in output currents \nof a slave relative to its master when two LT3086 regulators are paralleled. \nThe device is tested as a slave with V TRACK  = 0.693V, R MON = 330Ω \nand V SET = 0.4V, conditions when an ideal master is outputting 2.1A. \nThe specification limits account for the slave output tracking error from 2.1A and the worst-case error that can be contributed by a master: the maximum deviation of V\nSET from 0.4V and I MON from 2.1mA.\nNote 15: The LT3086 is tested and specified for these conditions with the I\nMON and I LIM pins tied together.\nNote 16: The LT3086 requires a minimum load current to ensure proper regulation and stability.\nTypical Dropout Voltage Guaranteed Dropout Voltage Dropout VoltageTypical perForMance

1, 16, Exposed Pad Pin 17/Pins 1, 8, 9, 16, \nExposed Pad Pin 17/Pin 4/Pin 4): Ground. The exposed \npad of the DFN and TSSOP packages as well as the Tab \nof the DD-Pak and TO-220 packages is an electrical con-\nnection to  GND. To ensure proper electrical and thermal \nperformance, tie the exposed pad or tab directly to the \nremaining GND pins of the relevant package and the PCB \nground. GND pin current is typically 1.2mA at zero load \nand increases to about 44mA at full load.\nILIM (Pin 2/Pin 2/Pin 1/Pin 1): External Current Limit \nProgramming. This pin externally programs current limit \nif connected to I MON and a resistor to GND. Current limit \nactivates if the voltage at I LIM equals 0.8V. Current limit \nequals: 1000 • (0.8V/R MON). An internal clamp typically \nlimits the I LIM voltage to 1V . If external current limit is set to \nless than 1A, connect a series 1k-10nF network in parallel \nwith the R MON resistor for stability. Internal current limit \nfoldback overrides externally programmed current limit if V\nIN – VOUT differential voltage is excessive. If external cur-\nrent limit  programming is not used, then ground this pin.\nIMON (Pin 3/Pin 2/Pin 1/Pin 1): Output Current Monitor. \nThis pin sources a current equal to 1/1000 of output load \ncurrent. Connecting a resistor from I MON to GND programs  \na load current dependent voltage for monitoring by an \nADC. If I MON connects to I LIM, current limit is externally \nprogrammable.\nCDC (Pin 4/Pin 3/NA/NA): Cable Drop Compensation. \nConnecting a single resistor (R CDC) between the CDC and \nSET pins provides programmable cable drop compensa-\ntion that  cancels output voltage errors caused by resistive \nconnections \nto the load. A resistor (R MON) from I MON to \nGND is also required to enable Cable Drop Compensation. \nChoose R MON first based on required current limit.\n RMON = 0.8V • 1000/I LIM\nCalculate the value of R CDC with this formula:\n RCDC = (R MON • RSET)/(3000 • R WIRE)\nwhere R WIRE is the total cable or wire resistance to and \nfrom the load. From a practical application standpoint, \nLT C recommends limiting cable drop compensation to \n20% of V OUT for applications needing good regulation. \nThe limiting factor is variations in wire temperature as copper wire resistance changes about 19% for a 50°C \ntemperature change. If output regulation requirements \nare loose (e.g., when using a secondary regulator), cable \ndrop compensation  of up to 50% may be used.\nRPWRGD  (Pin 5/Pin 4/NA/ NA): Power Good Threshold  \nVoltage Programming. This pin is the input to the power  \ngood comparator. Connecting a resistor between OUT and \nRPWRGD  programs an adjustable power good threshold  \nvoltage. The threshold voltage is 0.4V on the R PWRGD  pin, \nand a  50µA current source is connected from R PWRGD  \nto GND. If the voltage at R PWRGD  is less than 0.4V , the \nPWRGD flag asserts and pulls low. If the voltage at R P-\nWRGD  is greater than 0.4V , the PWRGD flag de-asserts  \nand becomes high impedance. For most applications, \nPWRGD is pulled high with a pull-up resistor. Calculate  \nthe value of R PWRGD  with this formula: \n RPWRGD  = (X • V OUT(NOMINAL)  – 0.4V)/50µA\nwhere X is normally in the 85% to 95% range.\nA 17µs deglitching filter suppresses false tripping of the \nPWRGD flag at the rising edge of PWRGD with instant \nreset. Hysteresis at the R PWRGD  pin is typically 0.6% on \nthe 0.4V threshold and the 50µA current source.\nSET (Pin 6/Pin 5/Pin 2/Pin 2): Output Voltage Program -\nming. This pin is the error amplifier’s inverting terminal. It \nregulates \nto 0.4V and a 50µA current source is connected \nfrom \nSET to GND. Connecting a single resistor from OUT \nto SET programs output voltage. Calculate the value of \nthe required resistor from the formula:\n RSET = (V OUT – 0.4V)/50µA\nConnecting a capacitor in parallel with R SET provides output  \nvoltage soft-start capability, improves transient response \nand decreases output voltage noise.The LT3086 error amplifier design is configured so that \nthe regulator always operates in unity-gain.OUT (Pins 7, 8/Pins 6, 7/Pin 3/Pin 3): Output. These \npin(s) supply power to the load. Connect all OUT pins \ntogether on the DHD and FE packages for proper operation. \nStability requirements demand a minimum 10µF ceramic output capacitor with an ESR less than 100mΩ to prevent \noscillations. Large load transients require larger output \ncapacitance to limit peak voltage transients.

The LT3086 requires \na 1mA minimum load current to ensure proper regula-\ntion and stability.\nIN (\nPins 10, 11/Pins 10, 11/Pin 5/Pin 5): Input. These \npin(s) supply power to the device. Connect all IN pins \ntogether on the DHD and FE packages for proper opera -\ntion. The  LT3086 requires a local IN bypass capacitor if \nit \nis located more than a few inches from the main input \nfilter capacitor. In general, battery output impedance rises \nwith frequency, so adding a bypass capacitor in battery \npowered circuits is advisable. A 10µF minimum input \ncapacitor generally suffices. The IN pin(s) withstand a \nreverse voltage of 45V. The device limits current flow and \nno negative voltage appears at OUT. The device protects \nitself and the load against batteries that are plugged in \nbackwards.SHDN (Pin 12/Pin 12/Pin 6/Pin 6): Shutdown/UVLO. \nPulling the SHDN pin typically below 1V puts the LT3086 \ninto a low power state and turns the output off. Quiescent current in shutdown is typically less than 1µA. The SHDN \npin turn- on threshold is typically 1.22V . This pin may either  \nbe used as a shutdown function \n or as an undervoltage \nlockout function. If using this pin as an undervoltage \nlockout function, use a resistor divider between IN and GND with the tap point tied to SHDN. If using the pin as \na shutdown function, drive the pin with either logic or an open-collector/drain with a pull-up resistor. The resistor \nsupplies the pull-up current to the open-collector/drain \nlogic, normally several microamperes, and the SHDN pin \ncurrent, typically less than 10µA at 6V. If unused, connect \nthe SHDN pin to IN.\nTEMP (Pin 13/Pin 13/Pin 7/Pin 7): Die Junction Tem-\nperature. This  \n pin outputs a voltage indicating the LT3086 \naverage die junction temperature. At 25°C , this pin typically  \noutputs 250mV. The TEMP pin slope equals 10mV/°C so \nthat at 125°C, this pin typically outputs 1.25V. This pin \ndoes not read temperatures less than 0°C. The TEMP pin \nis not meant to be an accurate temperature sensor, but \nis useful for debug, monitoring and calculating thermal resistance of the package mounted to the PCB. The TEMP pin also incorporates the ability to program a thermal limit temperature lower than the internal typical thermal \nshutdown temperature of 165°C. Tying a resistor from \nTEMP \nto GND programs the thermal limit temperature \nwith a 100µA trip point. Calculate the value of the resistor \nfrom the formula:\n  RTEMP =TSHDN •10mV\n°C\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n100µA\nwhere T SHDN is the desired die thermal limit temperature.\nThere are several degrees of hysteresis in the thermal \nshutdown that cycles the regulator output on and off. Limit \nthe capacitance on the TEMP pin to less than 100pF. To \nprevent saturation in the TEMP output device, ensure that \nVIN is higher than V TEMP by 250mV.\nTRACK (Pin 14/Pin 14/NA/NA): T rack pin for paralleling. \nThe TRACK pin allows multiple LT3086s to be paralleled \nin a master/slave(s) configuration for higher output cur -\nrent applications . This also allows heat to be spread out \non the PCB. This circuit technique does not require ballast resistors and does not degrade load regulation. Tying the TRACK pin of the slave device(s) to the I\nMON/ILIM pins \nof the master device enables this function. If the TRACK \nfunction is unused, TRACK is in a default clamped high \nstate. A TRACK pin voltage below 1.2V on slave device (s) \nshuts off the internal 50µA reference current at SET such \nthat only the 50µA reference current of the master device \nis active. All SET pins must be tied together in a master/\nslave configuration.\nPWRGD (Pin 15/Pin 15/NA/NA): Power Good  Flag . The \nP\nWRGD pin is an open-collector logic pin connected to \nthe output of the power good comparator. PWRGD asserts \nlow if the R PWRGD  pin is less than 400mV. The maximum \nlow output level of 200mV over temperature is defined for \n200μA of sink current. If R PWRGD  is greater than 400mV, \nthe PWRGD pin de-asserts and becomes high impedance. \nThe PWRGD pin may be pulled to 36V without damaging \nany internal circuitry regardless of the input voltage.\nLT308615\n3086fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3086block Diagra M\n0.05/uni03A9 QPOWER\n50/uni03A9120mV\n40k\n3086 BDIN\nGND100k 100k900mV 900mVIMON\nILIMOUT\nCDC\nENEN300mV\n–+\n120kCABLE\nDROP COMP\n–+\nCURRENT\nMONITOR+–\nINTERNAL\nILIMIT+–+–TEMP\n–++–\nEXTERNAL\nILIMIT\n+–\nTRACK\nENABLE300mV\n1.2V+–\nERROR\nAMPSET\nRPWRGD25k\n50µA\n50µA75k125k\nTRACK+–\nTRACK\ngm = 8µ13µA1.3V\nVREF\n400mV\nSHUTDOWN\nCONTROL17µs DELAY\nRPWRGD  RISING EDGE\nIN\nVTEMP\n10mV/°C\n25°C = 250mV\nSHDN1.22V\n100µAPWRGD\nTEMPIMON =IOUT\n1000\nLT308616\n3086fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3086applica Tions inForMaTion\nThe LT3086 is a multifunction, low dropout, low noise, \nlinear regulator with shutdown, and adjustable power \ngood. The device supplies 2.1A with a typical dropout \nvoltage of 330mV and operates over a wide 1.4V to 40V \ninput supply range.\nThe operating quiescent current is 1.2mA and drops to less \nthan 1µA in shutdown. The LT3086 regulator optimizes \nstability and transient response with a minimum low ESR \n10µF ceramic output capacitor. A single resistor sets the \noutput voltage from 0.4V to 32V. Similarly, a single resis-\ntor sets  the power good threshold. The regulator typically \nprovides 0.1% line regulation and 0.1% load regulation.\nThe \nLT3086 has convenient programmable diagnostic \nfeatures. An output current monitor, that is typically \n1/1000 of the output current, can set the current limit \nlower than the typical 2.4A internal limit. A temperature \nmonitor, that is typically 10mV/°C where 250mV = 25°C, \ncan set the thermal limit lower than the typical 165°C \ninternal thermal limit.For applications where the voltage error at the load is \ncaused by the resistance in the connections between the \nLT3086 and the load, programmable cable drop compen-\nsation cancels \n the error with a single resistor. Multiple \nLT3086 regulators can be paralleled for higher load cur-\nrents and heat spreading without the need for external \nballast resistors.\nDuring\n load transients where the output overshoots  \n(regulated output voltages of 0.8V or higher), an internal \npull-down current activates pulling about 15mA from the \nOUT pin to ground. The pull-down current is disabled when  \nthe output is at or below regulation. The regulator and \nthe output overshoot pull-down turn off when the output \nvoltage is pulled higher than the input by typically 225mV. \nCurves of OUT Over IN Shutdown Threshold appear in the \nTypical Performance Characteristics section.\nInternal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery pro-\ntection, reverse- output  protection, reverse- current protec -\ntion, current limit with foldback and thermal shutdown.\nProgramming Output V\noltage\nThe LT3086 has an output voltage range of 0.4 to 32V. \nThe output voltage is programmed with a single resistor, \nRSET, connected from OUT to the SET pin, as shown in \nFigure 1. The SET pin has an internal 50µA current source to ground that generates a voltage drop across R SET. The \ndevice servos the output to maintain the SET pin voltage \nat 0.4V referenced to ground.

Connecting \na resistor between the RPWRGD and PWRGD pins can \nincrease the power good hysteresis.

In order for the power good threshold to be \nindependent of the cable drop compensation’s modulation \nof the LT3086’s output voltage as a function of load cur-\nrent, connect  a resistor between CDC and R PWRGD  with the \nsame value as R CDC, the resistor between CDC and SET. \nThis technique avoids connecting the R PGSET  resistor to \nthe load voltage through a long trace/wire and eliminates \npotential stray signal coupling into the R PWRGD  pin. See \nthe front page Typical Application circuit as an example.\nOutput Voltage Noise and T ransient Response\nThe LT3086 regulator provides low output voltage noise \nover a 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth while operating at full \nload. Output voltage noise  is approximately 65nV/√Hz \nover \nthis frequency bandwidth at the unity gain output \nvoltage of 0.4V at 2.1A. \nTo lower output voltage noise for higher output voltages, \ninclude a feedforward capacitor, C SET, from OUT to the \nSET pin, as shown in Figure 3. A good quality, low leakage \ncapacitor is recommended. This capacitor bypasses the \nvoltage setting resistor, R SET, providing a low frequency \nnoise pole. With the use of 10nF for C SET, output voltage \nnoise decreases from 280µV RMS to 40µV RMS at 2.1A when \nthe output voltage is set to 5V.\n3086 F03IN\nSHDN\nIMON\nILIMOUT\nSET\nGNDL T3086VIN\nVIMONVOUT\nCOUT RSET\nRMONCSETFigure 2.

An internal delay of typically 17µs exists only for \nthe rising edge (when the regulator output voltage rises \nabove the power good threshold) to reject noise or chatter \nduring startup. If the power good function is not needed, \nleave the R PWRGD  and PWRGD pins floating.\nThe power good threshold is typically programmed to 85% \nto 95% of the regulated output voltage. Due to variations in \nregulator parameters and resistor variations, it is not practi -\ncal to set  the power good threshold greater than 95% of the \noutput voltage. Account for load transients where the output  \nvoltage droops momentarily before recovering. If increasing  \noutput capacitance to reduce output voltage undershoot or \nif setting the power good threshold lower is not possible, a \ncapacitor, CPGSET , from R PWRGD  to ground can filter and delay  \nthe output signal. This allows for a configurable deglitching  \nperiod before the power good threshold trips. For example, \nconsider an application with a nominal 1 V output using 10µF \nof output capacitance and the power good threshold set \nfor 90% of V OUT( NOMINAL) . A 1.5A output load current step \nmomentarily undershoots  VOUT below the 90% threshold  \nfor more than 4µs , thus triggering the PWRGD pin to pull \nlow. Using a C PGSET  of greater than 270pF deglitches the \npower good comparator and prevents the PWRGD pin from \npulling low for undershoot events less than 4µs in duration.\nFor applications using cable drop compensation and re -\nquiring a power good signal, calculate the value of R PGSET  3086 F02IN\nSHDN\nIMON\nILIMOUT\nSET\nGNDL T3086VIN\nVIMONVOUT\nVLOGIC\nOR V OUTRSET\nRMONPWRGDRPWRGD\nVPWRGDRPGSET\nCPGSET\n(OPTIONAL)RPGD RPGSET=x•VOUT(NOMINAL) – 0.4V\n50µA\nWHERE 85% ≤ x ≤ 95% TYPICALLY\nHigher values of output voltage noise are often measured \nif care is not exercised with regard to circuit layout and \ntesting.

In addition, inter-\nnal current  limit foldback overrides external current limit \nif the V IN – V OUT differential voltage becomes excessive.\nNote that the output current monitor represents not just \nthe load current, but the current into the output capacitor \nas well. During startup and large load transients, the output  \ncurrent monitor indicates the current required to charge \nthe output capacitor in addition to the load current. To \nprevent external current limit from engaging prematurely, \nset the external current limit above the maximum load \ncurrent to allow the output capacitor to recover without \nbeing current limited.\nFor external current limits set for less than 1A, connect a \nseries 1k-10nF RC network from I LIM to ground to ensure \ncurrent limit loop stability. Adding an RC network from I LIM \nto ground also delays the current monitor signal, allowing \noutput currents higher than the external current limit for a \nlimited duration. This is useful for applications with large \noutput capacitance that would otherwise trigger external \ncurrent limit during startup and large load transients, \nslowing output voltage recovery. To guarantee external \ncurrent limit stability, ensure that  the RC network from \nILIM to GND has a capacitor value equal to or greater than \n10nF and the resistor value is between 0.01• C–0.6 and \n1k. C is the capacitor value in units of farads. LT C does \nnot recommend an RC network other than the 1k-10nF \ncombination if using the cable drop compensation and \nparalleling functions.To configure the output current monitor and external cur -\nrent limit correctly, decide on the necessary current limit \nand \nfull-scale monitor output voltage. Voltage is limited to \n0.8V if I MON is tied to I LIM. External current limit is typically \nset 10% to 20% above maximum load current to allow for Start-up time is affected by the use of a C SET feedforward \ncapacitor.

Settling \ntime to 1% is approximately:\n  tSETTLE =4.2•VOUT•CSET\n50µA\nSee the Start-Up Time vs C SET curve in the Typical Perfor-\nmance Characteristics  section. If  the LT3086 is configured  \nfor cable drop compensation, LT C does not recommend \nusing a feedforward capacitor because C SET filters the \nCDC correction signal and transient response to load \ncurrent changes degrades.\nOutput Current Monitor and External Current Limit\nCurrent out of the I MON pin is typically equal to 1/1000 \nof the regulator’s output current. The output current \nmonitor maintains accuracy across the full input voltage \nrange, even during dropout. A resistor, R MON, placed from \nIMON to ground, sets the voltage scale factor for use with \nanalog-to-digital converters, as shown in Figure 5. For \nexample, with 442Ω for R MON, VIMON is set for 0.663V \nwhen I OUT = 1.5A.\nExternal current limit activates if the voltage on the I LIM \npin exceeds the typical 0.8V threshold.

For \nexample, if the maximum load current is 1.5A and both \nIMON and I LIM pins are tied together, an R MON scaling \nresistor of 442Ω yields an external current limit of 1.8A.\nIf higher output current monitor voltages are needed, the \nDFN package offers the ability to separate the I MON and \nILIM pins with a resistor, as shown in Figure 6. To  prevent \nsaturation in the I MON output device, choose R MON so that \nVIMON is at least 0.6V less than V IN. If external current is \nnot needed, ground the I LIM pin.\nOutput current monitor accuracy for very low output cur-\nrents is limited  by the offset in the current monitor amplifier  \nand parasitic current paths. The equivalent circuit of the \nparasitic current paths are shown in Figure 7. With zero \noutput load current, the current into R MON is typically \n11µA when the I MON and I LIM pins are tied together. As \na result, load currents between 0mA and 11mA typically \ncannot be measured. See Current Monitor Offset curves \nin the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nLoad Regulation and Cable Drop Compensation\nOutput load regulation for the LT3086 is typically 0.1%. \nOptimal regulation is obtained when the R SET feedback \nresistor is connected to the OUT pin of the regulator. In high current applications, small voltage drops appear due \nto the resistances of PCB traces or wires between the \nregulator and the load. These drops may be eliminated by connecting R\nSET directly to the output at the load as \nshown in Figure 8. Note that the voltage drop across R OUT \nand R RTN add to the dropout voltage of the regulator. The \nvoltage drop across R GND should also be minimized to \nreduce output voltage error due to ground pin current. \nSee GND Pin Current curves in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section.\nThe LT3086 has cable drop compensation (CDC) func -\ntionality that  allows delivery of well regulated voltage \nto remote loads using only two wires of known fixed \nresistance. Compensation is user programmed by con -\nnecting a resistor, R CDC, between the SET and CDC pins, \nas shown in Figure 9.At zero load current, the CDC pin typically regulates to \nthe same voltage as the SET pin. The voltage decreases \nat a rate equal to 1/3 of the change in I\nMON voltage. For \nexample, if V IMON increases from 0 to 0.6V , VCDC decreases  \n3086 F09IN\nSHDN\nIMON\nILIMOUT\nSET\nGNDL T3086\nVINCLOAD\n(OPTIONAL)RSET\nRCDC\nRMONCDCCOUT\nRLINE2RLINE1LLINE1\nRESR\n(OPTIONAL)\nLLINE2LOAD\n RCDC=RMON•RSET\n3000•RWIRE RWIRE=RLINE1+RLINE23086 F08IN\nSHDNI\nMON\nILIMOUT\nSET\nGNDL T3086\nVIN\nRMONRGND\nRRTNROUT\nRSET\nLOAD\nFigure 6.

As a result, the current that flows through R CDC \nis proportional to load current which increases the voltage \nacross R SET, effectively increasing output voltage. R CDC is \nselected using the following equation so that the voltage \nat the OUT pin increases to cancel the voltage drop in the \ncables connected to the load.\n  RCDC=RMON•RSET\n3000 •RWIRE\nwhere R WIRE is the total resistance of the supply and return \ncabling connecting the LT3086 to the load.\nFigure 10 shows the transient response with cable drop \ncompensation.

Master/Slave(s) Configuration for ParallelingThere are limits to the amount of voltage drop that can \nbe compensated using cable drop compensation. Using \ncable drop compensation subjects load regulation to the \nvariability of the current monitor voltage output and the \ncabling resistance. LT C recommends limiting cable drop \ncompensation to 20% of V OUT for applications needing \ngood regulation. The limiting factor is variations in wire \ntemperature as copper wire resistance changes about \n19% for a 50°C temperature change. If output regulation \nrequirements are loose (e.g., when using a secondary \nregulator), cable drop compensation of up to 50% may be used.\nNoise from the current monitor output affects noise seen \nat the output. Filtering the current monitor output with an \nRC network from I\nLIM to ground is effective at reducing \nthis noise source, especially at light loads. Consult the \nOutput Current Monitor and External Current Limit section \nfor more information\nParalleling Multiple Regulators\nThe LT3086 has been specifically designed to make paral -\nleling  multiple  r egulators together  easy. Paralleling enables  \napplications to increase total output current and to spread \nheat dissipated by the regulator over a wider area on the \nPCB. The parallel scheme is based on a master/slave \nprinciple, where one  LT3086 is designated as master, \nand \nthe other regulators act as slaves with active sharing \nof total load current, as shown in Figure 11. The slave’s \ninternal current tracking amplifier compares the current \nmonitor output from the master with the current monitor \noutput seen at the slave’s I LIM pin, and servos the slave’s \noutput current to match the master’s.If long cables are used, an additional supply bypass capacitor, C\nLOAD, should be added directly to the load \nto handle large load transient conditions. C OUT must still \ndirectly connect to the OUT pin to ensure stable operation \nof the LT3086, minimizing output capacitor ESR and ESL. Long cables have inductance where a resonance forms \nbetween the wire inductance, L\nWIRE and C LOAD. Damping \nis accomplished by adding series resistance, R ESR, to \nCLOAD. The value of R ESR is approximately:\n  RESR =2•LWIRE\nCLOAD\nLT308621\n3086fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3086applica Tions inForMaTion\nThe master LT3086 is connected exactly the same as a \nsingle regulator where its output current monitor voltage \nseen at its I LIM pin is used as the common current tracking \nsignal. The slave devices  connect  this signal  to their TRACK  \npins to make their output current equal to the master’s.\nThe TRACK pin has an internal pull-up current that is \ntypically 15µA at 0.75V. When the TRACK pin is unused, \nthe pin is pulled up and clamped at 1.25V, disabling the \ncurrent tracking amplifier. When the TRACK pin is con -\nnected to  the master current tracking signal, the TRACK \npin \nvoltage is pulled below the 1.2V threshold, enabling the \ncurrent tracking amplifier and disabling the slave’s 50µA \nreference current, I SET. Disabling the reference current \nensures that the master is the only device controlling the \noutput voltage. Set the maximum master current tracking \nsignal to less than 0.8V to prevent external current limit from triggering prematurely. To prevent the slave current \ntracking amplifier from ever being disabled, the slave TRACK pin must be tied to the master I\nLIM pin. The master \nILIM pin has an internal 1V clamp that is below the slave \n1.2V current tracking amplifier enable threshold.\nWhen  \nmultiple slaves are used, a smaller master R MON \nresistor should be used to compensate for the pull-up \ncurrents from all the TRACK pins of the slaves. For ex -\nample, a master sourcing 2.1A typically has 0.697V at its \nILIM pin with an R MON resistor of 332Ω. Referring to the \nTRACK pin pull-up current curve in the Typical Perfor-\nmance Characteristics , with 0.697V on the TRACK pin, \neach slave typically adds 15µA to the master’s 2.1mA \nIMON output. For an application with 3 slaves connected, \ndecrease R MON’s value to:\n  RMON =0.697V\n[2.1mA +3•15µA ( ) ]=325 Ω\nThe closest 1% resistor value equals 324Ω.\nAll slave regulators must have their SET pins connected \nto the master SET pin. The TRACK amplifier operates by \nadjusting the slave internal reference voltage slightly as \na function of the difference in master and slave current monitor voltages. This has a strong effect on the slave \noutput current, which forces the slave output current to \nmatch the master.Mismatch between master and slave internal reference \nvoltages and current monitor outputs, offset in the slave \nTRACK amplifier and TRACK pin pull-up currents all \ncontribute to output current sharing error. In the case of \nnegative offset, a slave runs less current than the master. \nAt very light loads, negative offset enables the slave output \novershoot pull-down circuit, forcing the master to supply \ncurrent to keep the output voltage within regulation. As a \nresult, quiescent current may increase for very light loads \nin the master/slave configuration.\nIn some applications, multiple regulators may be spaced \nsome distance apart to optimize heat distribution. That \nmakes the use of low resistance traces important to con -\nnect each regulator to the local ground system and to avoid \nground \nloops created by load currents. Ground currents \ncan be  as high as 30mA at 1.5A and 50mA at 2.1A, for \neach \nregulator. Limiting differential ground pin voltages to \nless than 10mV minimizes tracking errors. Ground trace \nresistance between master and slaves should be less than \n10mV/30mA = 0.33Ω at 1.5A load, and 10mV/50mA = \n0.2Ω for 2.1A load.  \nOutput Capacitance\nThe LT3086 regulator is stable with a wide range of output \ncapacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects stabil -\nity, most notably with small capacitors. Use a minimum \noutput \ncapacitor of 10µF with an ESR of 0.1Ω or less to \nprevent oscillations. The output load transient response is \na function of output capacitance. Larger values of output \ncapacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide im -\nproved transient  response for larger load current changes. \nFor applications with large load current transients, a low \nESR ceramic capacitor in parallel with a bulk tantalum \ncapacitor often provides an optimally damped response. For example, a 47µF tantalum capacitor with ESR = 0.1Ω \nin parallel with the 10µF ceramic capacitor with ESR < \n0.01Ω reduces output deviation by about 2:1 for large \ntransient loads and increases loop phase margin.\nGive extra consideration to the use of ceramic capacitors. \nManufacturers make ceramic capacitors with a variety of \ndielectrics, each  with different behavior across tempera-\nture \nand applied voltage. The most common dielectrics \nare \nspecified with EIA temperature characteristic codes \nof Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R.

Ceramic Capacitor Temperature Characteristicsapplica Tions inForMaTion\nprovide high C-V products in a small package at low cost, \nbut exhibit strong voltage and temperature coefficients, as \nshown in Figures 12 and 13. When used with a  5V regulator, \na 16V 10µF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value \nas low as 1µF to 2µF for the DC bias voltage applied, and \nover the operating temperature range. The X5R and X7R \ndielectrics yield much more stable characteristics and are more suitable for use as the output capacitor.\nThe X7R type works over a wider temperature range and \nhas better temperature stability, while the X5R is less \nexpensive and is available in higher values. Care still must \nbe exercised when using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R \nand X7R codes only specify operating temperature range \nand maximum capacitance change over temperature. \nCapacitance changes due to DC bias is less with X5R and \nX7R capacitors, but can still be significant enough to drop \ncapacitor values below appropriate levels. Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to improve as component case \nsize increases, but expected capacitance at operating \nvoltage should be verified .\nVoltage \nand temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, \nsimilar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or mi -\ncrophone works. For a ceramic capacitor, the stress is \ninduced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients. \nThe resulting voltages produced can cause appreciable \namounts of noise.\nInput Capacitance\nLow ESR ceramic input bypass capacitors are acceptable for \napplications with short input and ground leads. However, \napplications connecting a power supply to the LT3086 \nusing long wires are prone to voltage spikes, reliability \nconcerns and application-specific board oscillations.\nThe input wire inductance found in many battery-powered \napplications, combined  with the low ESR ceramic  capacitor , \nforms a high-Q LC resonant tank circuit. In some instances \nthis resonant frequency beats against the output current \ndependent LDO bandwidth and interferes with proper \noperation. Simple circuit modifications are then required. \nThis behavior is not indicative of LT3086 instability, but \nis a common application issue.\nThe self-inductance, or isolated inductance, of a wire is \ndirectly proportional to its length. Wire diameter is not a \nmajor factor on its self-inductance. For example , the self-\ninductance \nof a 2-AWG  isolated wire (diameter = 0.26") is \nabout half the self-inductance of a 30-AWG  wire (diameter \n= 0.01"). One foot of 30-AWG  wire has approximately \n465nH of self-inductance. Tw o methods can reduce wire \nself-inductance. One method divides the current flowing \ntowards the LT3086 between two parallel conductors. In \nthis case, the farther apart the wires are from each other, \nthe more the self-inductance is reduced; up to a 50% \nreduction when placed a few inches apart. Splitting the \nwires connects two equal inductors in parallel, but placing \nthem in close proximity creates mutual inductance add -\ning to the self-inductance. The second and most effective \nway \nto reduce overall inductance is to place both forward \nLT308623\n3086fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3086applica Tions inForMaTion\nand return current conductors (the input and GND wires) \nin very close proximity. Tw o 30-AWG  wires separated by \nonly 0.02", used as forward- and return-current conduc -\ntors, reduce the overall self-inductance to approximately \none-fifth that of a single isolated wire.\nIf \na battery, mounted  in close proximity, powers  the LT3086 , \na 10μF input capacitor suffices for stability. However, if a \ndistant supply powers the LT3086, use a larger value input \ncapacitor. Use a rough guideline of 1μF (in addition to the \n10μF minimum) per 8 inches of wire length. The minimum \ninput capacitance needed to stabilize the application also \nvaries with power supply output impedance variations. \nPlacing additional capacitance on the LT3086’s output also \nhelps. However, this requires an order of magnitude more \ncapacitance in comparison with additional LT3086 input \nbypassing. Series resistance between the supply and the \nLT3086 input also helps stabilize the application; as little \nas 0.1Ω to 0.5Ω suffices. This impedance dampens the \nLC tank circuit at the expense of dropout voltage. A bet-\nter alternative is to add additional input capacitance with \nhigher  \nESR at the input, such as tantalum or electrolytic \ncapacitors, or by adding resistance in series with a low \nESR ceramic capacitor.\nOverload Recovery\nLike \nmany IC power regulators, the LT3086 has safe \noperating area protection. The safe operating area protec -\ntion decreases  current limit as input-to-output voltage \nincreases, and keeps the power transistor inside a safe \noperating region for all values of input-to-output voltage. \nThe LT3086 provides some output current at all values of \ninput- to-output voltage up to the specified 45V operational  \nmaximum. Current limit foldback overrides external current  \nlimit (if used) if V IN – V OUT voltage differential becomes \nexcessive.When power is first applied, the input voltage rises and the \noutput follows the input; allowing the regulator to start-up \ninto very heavy loads. During start-up, as the input voltage \nis rising, the input-to-output voltage differential is small, \nallowing the regulator to supply large output currents. \nWith a high input voltage, a problem can occur wherein \nthe removal of an output short will not allow the output \nto recover. Other regulators, such as the LT1083/LT1084/\nLT1085 family and LT1764A also exhibit this phenomenon, so it is not unique to the LT3086. The problem occurs with \na heavy output load when the input voltage  \n is high and the \noutput voltage is low. Common situations are immediately \nafter the removal of a short-circuit or if the shutdown pin \nis pulled high after the input voltage is already turned on. \nThe load line intersects the output current curve at two \npoints creating two stable output operating points for the \nregulator. With this double intersection, the input power \nsupply needs to be cycled down to zero and brought up \nagain for the output to recover.\nThermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the LT3086 is limited \nby the maximum rated junction temperature (125°C for \nLT3086E, LT3086I, LT3086MP or 150°C for LT3086H). \nThree components comprise the power dissipated by the \ndevice:1.\n Output \ncurrent multiplied by the input/output voltage \ndifferential:\n IOUT • (V IN − V OUT),\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:\n IGND • VIN, and\n3. Current \nmonitor current multiplied by the input/current \nmonitor voltage differential:\n IMON • (V IN − V IMON)\nGND pin current is determined using the GND Pin Current \ncurves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section. \nPower dissipation equals the sum of the three components  \nlisted above.\nThe LT3086 regulator has internal thermal limiting that pro-\ntects the device  during overload conditions. For continuous  \nnormal conditions, the maximum junction temperature of \n125°C (E-grade, I-grade, MP-grade) or 150°C (H-grade) \nmust not be exceeded. Carefully consider all sources of thermal resistance from junction-to-ambient including \nother heat sources mounted in proximity to the LT3086.\nThe underside of the LT3086 DFN and TSSOP packages \nhave exposed metal (10.5mm\n2) from the lead to the die \nattachment. These packages allow heat to directly transfer \nfrom the die junction to the printed circuit board metal. \nThe dual-in-line pin arrangement allows metal to extend \nLT308624\n3086fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3086applica Tions inForMaTion\nbeyond the ends of the package on the topside ( component \nside) of a PCB. Connect this metal to GND on the PCB. \nThe multiple IN and OUT pins of the LT3086 also assist \nin spreading heat to the PCB.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board \nand its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated \nthrough-holes also can spread the heat generated by \npower devices.\nTables 2 and 3 list thermal resistance for several topside \ncopper areas on a fixed board size. All measurements were \ntaken in still air on a 4-layer FR-4 board with 1oz solid \ninternal planes and 2oz top/bottom external trace planes \nwith a total board thickness of 1.6mm. The four layers \nwere electrically isolated with no thermal vias present. \nAchieving low thermal resistance necessitates attention \nto detail and careful PCB layout. For more information \non thermal resistance and high thermal conductivity  \ntest boards, refer to JEDEC standard JESD51, notably \nJESD51 -12 \nand JESD51-7. The use of thermal vias, \nincreased copper weight, and air flow, will improve the \nresultant thermal resistance. \nTable 2.

The effects of heat sinking, the enclosure, and any \nair movement can be instantly analyzed without special \ninstrumentation.\nCalculating Junction Temperature\nExample: Given an output voltage of 5V, an input voltage \nrange of 6V ±5%, a maximum output current range of 1A \nwith 698Ω for R\nMON, and a maximum ambient temperature \nof 75°C, what will the maximum junction temperature be?\nThe power dissipated by the device equals:\n IOUT(MAX)  • (V IN(MAX)  − V OUT) + I GND • VIN(MAX)  + \n IMON(MAX)  • (V IN(MAX)  − V IMON(MAX) )\nwhere,\n IOUT(MAX)  = 1A\n VIN(MAX)  = 6.3V\n IGND at (I OUT = 1A, V IN = 6.3V) = 11mA\n VIMON at (I OUT = 1A, R MON = 698Ω) = 0.698V\nSo:\n P = 1A\n • (6.3V − 5V) + 11mA • 6.3V +  \n 1mA • (6.3V − 0.698V) = 1.38W\nUsing \na DFN package, the thermal resistance will be in the \nrange \nof 25°C/W to 33°C/W depending on the topside cop-\nper area. So the junction temperature rise above ambient \napproximately equals:\n 1.38\nW • 30°C/W = 41.4°C\nThe maximum junction temperature equals the maximum \nambient temperature plus the maximum junction tempera -\nture rise above ambient or:\n TJMAX = 75°C + 41.4°C = 116.4°C\nProtection FeaturesThe LT3086 regulator incorporates several protection \nfeatures that make it ideal for use in battery-powered \ncircuits. In addition to the normal protection features \nLT308625\n3086fb For more information www.linear .com/L T3086Figure 16. OUT Over IN Shutdown ThresholdFigure 14. Reverse-Output Current\nFigure 15. Output Overshoot Pull-Down Currentapplica Tions inForMaTion\nassociated with monolithic regulators, such as current \nlimiting and thermal limiting, the devices also protect \nagainst reverse-input voltages, reverse-output voltages, \nand reverse-output-to-input voltages.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nprotect the device against current overload conditions at \nthe output of the device. The typical thermal shutdown \ntemperature is 165°C and incorporates about 7°C of hys -\nteresis. For  normal operation, do not exceed the maximum \nrated \njunction temperature of 125°C (LT3086E, LT3086I, \nLT3086MP) or 150°C (LT3086H).\nThe LT3086 IN pin withstands reverse voltages of 45V . The \ndevice limits current flow to less than 2mA (typically less \nthan 1μA) and no negative voltage appears at OUT. The \ndevice protects both itself and the load against batteries \nthat are plugged in backwards.The LT3086 incurs no damage if its output is pulled be -\nlow ground . If the input is left open-circuit or grounded, \nthe \noutput can be pulled below ground by 36V. No cur-\nrent flows through the pass transistor from the output. \nHowever, \ncurrent flows in (but is limited by) the feedback \nresistors R SET, that sets the output voltage, and R RPWRGD , \nthat sets the power good threshold. Current flows from \nthe internal clamps in the SET and R PWRGD  pins to the \nexternal circuitry pulling OUT below ground. If the input \nis powered by a voltage source, the device protects itself \nby turning off the power device when the internal clamps \nactivate. If Schottky diodes are used to prevent the SET \nand R PWRGD  pins from activating their internal clamps, the \noutput sources current equal to its current limit capability \nand the LT3086 protects itself by thermal limiting. In this \ncase, grounding the SHDN pin turns off the device and \nstops the output from sourcing current. Reverse current flow follows the curve shown in Figure 14.\nThe LT3086 incurs no damage if the SET and R\nPWRGD  \npins are pulled above ground up to 36V. If the input is \nleft open-circuit or grounded, the SET pin performs like a \nlarge resistor (typically 80k) in series with a diode.\nIn circuits where a secondary supply raises the output \nvoltage above the regulated voltage set by R SET, the output \novershoot circuitry pulls current from the output pin to \nground as long as the output voltage is  below the input \nvoltage. \nOutput overshoot current follows the curve shown  OUTPUT VOL TAGE (V)\n3086 F140 20 32 4 24 28 16 8 12REVERSE OUTPUT CURRENT (mA)0.6\n0.5\n0.3\n0.10.4\n0.2\n0TJ = 25°C\nVIN = 0V\nVOUT = VSET = VRPWRGD\nCURRENT FLOWS THROUGH\nPINS TO GROUND\nOUT , R PWRGDSET\nOUTPUT VOL TAGE (V)\n3086 F150 20 36 32 4 24 28 16 8 12OUTPUT OVERSHOOT PULL-DOWN (mA)30\n25\n15\n520\n10\n0TJ = 25°C\nVIN = 0V\nVOUT = VSET = VRPWRGD\nCURRENT FLOWS THROUGH\nOUT PIN TO GND\nTEMPERATURE (°C)–75OUT OVER IN SHUTDOWN THRESHOLD (mV)300\n275\n225175\n150\n100\n50250200\n125\n75\n25\n0\n100 –25\n3086 F16175 0 –50 125 150 75 25 50ON TO OFF\nOFF TO ONin Figure 15.
