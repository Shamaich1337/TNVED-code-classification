True 16-bit p-p resolution is achievable with a total \nconversion time of 250 μs (4 kHz channel switching), making it \nideally suited to high resolution multiplexing applications. \nThe part can be configured via a simple digital interface, which \nallows users to balance the noise performance against data \nthroughput up to 15 kHz. \nThe analog front end features eight single-ended or four fully \ndifferential input channels with unipolar or bipolar 625 mV , 1.25 V , and 2.5 V input ranges. It accepts a common-mode input voltage from 200 mV above AGND to AV\nDD − 300 mV . \nThe differential reference input features no-reference detect \ncapability. The ADC also supports per channel system \ncalibration options.  \nThe digital serial interface can be configured for 3-wire \noperation and is compatible with microcontrollers and digital signal processors. All interface inputs are Schmitt triggered. The part is specified for operation over the extended industrial \ntemperature range of –40°C to +105°C. \nOther parts in the AD7739 family are the AD7738, AD7734, \nand AD7732. \nThe AD7738 is similar to the AD7739 but has higher speed \n(8.5 kHz channel switching for 16-bit performance) and higher \nAIN leakage current. The AD7738 multiplexer output is pinned \nout externally, allowing the user to implement programmable \ngain or signal conditioning before being applied to the ADC. \nThe AD7734 analog front end features four single-ended input \nchannels with unipolar or true bipolar input ranges to ±10 V \nwhile operating from a single +5 V analog supply. The AD7734 \naccepts an analog input overvoltage to ±16.5 V without \ndegrading the performance of the adjacent channels.  \nThe AD7732 is similar to the AD7734, but its analog front end \nfeatures two fully differential input channels. \n DVDD\nSERIAL\nINTERFACE\nCONTROL\nLOGICMUXREFERENCE\nDETECT\nI/O PORTCLOCK\nGENERATOR24-BIT\n\uf053-\uf044 ADCBUFFER\nAD7739\nCALIBRATION\nCIRCUITRY\nAVDDSCLK\nDINDOUTCS\nRDYRESETAIN4\nAIN5AIN6AIN7\nAINCOM/P0AIN0AIN1AIN2AIN3REFIN(–) REFIN(+)\nSYNC/P1\nDGND DVDD MCLKIN MCLKOUT AGND AVDD\n03742-0-012\nAD7739  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Channel system calibration reduces these errors to the order of the noise. \n4 Applies after the zero-scale and full-scale calibration. The negative full-scale error repres ents the remainin g error after re moving the offset and gain error. \n5 Specifications before calibration. ADC zero-scale self-calibration or channel zero-scale system calibration reduce this error t o the order of the noise. \n6 For specified performance. The output data span corresponds to the specified nominal input voltag e range. The ADC is functional  outside the nominal input voltage \nrange, but the performance might degrade. Outside the nominal input voltage range, the OVR bit in the channel status register i s set and the channel data register \nvalue depends on the clamp bit in the mode register. See the register and circuit descriptions for details. \n7 For specified performance. If the analog input absolute voltage (referred to AGND) changes more than 0.5 V during one conversio n time, the result can be affected by \ndistortion in the input buffer. This limit does not apply to analog input absolute voltages below 3 V. \n8 If chopping is enabled or when switchin g between channels, a dynamic current charge s the capacitance of the multiplexer. See t he circuit description for details. \n9 For specified performance.

An external serial clock is applied to this input \nto transfer serial data to or from the AD7739.  \n2 MCLKIN Master Clock Signal for the ADC. This can be provided in the form of a crystal/resonator or \nexternal clock. A crystal/resonator can be tied across the MCLKIN and MCLKOUT pins. \nAlternatively, MCLKIN can be driven with a CMOS compatible clock and MCLKOUT can be \nleft unconnected.  \n3 MCLKOUT  Master Clock Signal for the ADC. When the master clock for the device is a crystal/ \nresonator, the crystal/resonator is connected between MCLKIN and MCLKOUT. If an \nexternal clock is applied to the MCLKIN, MCLKOUT provides an  inverted clock signal or \ncan be switched off to reduce the device power consumption. MCLKOUT can drive one \nCMOS load.  \n4 CS Chip Select. Active low Schmitt triggered logic input with an internal pull -up resistor. \nWith this input hardwired low, the AD7739 can operate in its 3 -wire interface mode using \nSCLK, DIN, and DOUT. CS can be used to select the device in systems with more than one \ndevice on the serial bus. It can also b e used as an 8 -bit frame synchronization signal.  \n5 RESET  Schmitt Triggered Logic Input. Active low input that resets the control logic, interface \nlogic, digital filter, analog modulator, and all on -chip registers of the part to power -on \nstatus. Effectively, everything on the part except the clock oscillator is reset when \nthe RESET  pin is exercised.  \n6 AV DD Analog Positive Supply Voltage, 5  V to AGND Nominal.  \n7 AINCOM/P0  Analog Inputs Common Terminal/Digital Output. The function of this pin is determined \nby the P0 DIR bit in the I/O port register; the digital value can be written as the P0 bit in \nthe I/O port register. The digital voltage is referenced to analog supplies. When \nconfigured as an input (P0 DIR bit set to 1),  the single -ended analog inputs 0  to 7  \n(AIN0  to AIN7) can be referenced to the voltage level of this pin . \n8 SYNC /P1 SYNC /Digital Input/Digital Output. The pin direction is de termined by the P1 DIR bit; the \ndigital valu e can be read/written as the P1 bit in the I/O port register. When the s ync bit in \nthe I/O port register is set to 1, then the SYNC /P1 pin can be used to synchronize the \nAD7739 modulator and digital filter with other devices in the system. The digital voltage \nis referenced to the analog supplies. When configured as an input, tie the pin  high or low.  \n9 to 16 AIN0  to AIN7  Analog Inputs.  \n17 REFIN(+)  Positive Terminal of the Differential Reference Input. REFIN(+) voltage potential can lie \nanywhere between AV DD and AGND. In normal circuit configuration, connect this pin to a \n2.5 V reference voltage.  \n18 REFIN( −) Negative Terminal of the Differential Reference Input.

A | Page 11 of 32 OUTPUT NOISE AND RESOLUTION SPECIFICATION \nThe AD7739 can be operated  with chopping enabled or \ndisabled, allowing the ADC to be programmed to optimize \neither the offset drift performance or the throughput rate and channel switching time. Noise tables for these two primary modes of operation are outlined below for a selectio n of output \nrates and settling times. \nThe AD7739 noise performance depends on the selected \nchopping mode, the filter word (FW) value, and the selected \nanalog input range. The AD7739 noise does  not vary \nsignificantly with MCLK frequency.  \nCHOPPING ENABLED  \nThe first mode, in which the AD7739 is configured with \nchopping enabled ( chop = 1), provides very low noise with \nlower output rates. Table 5 to Table 7 show t he −3 dB frequencies and typical \nperformance versus the channel conversion time and equivalent output data rate, respectively.  \nTable 5 shows the typical output rms noise . Table 6 shows the \ntypical effective resolution based on rms noise. Table 7 shows \nthe typical output peak -to-peak resolution, representing values \nfor which there is  no code flicker within a 6 -sigma limit. The \npeak -to-peak resolutions are not calculated based on rms noise \nbut on peak -to-peak noise.  \nThese typical numbers are genera ted from 4096 data samples \nacquired in continuous conversion mode with an analog input voltage set to 0 V and MCLK = 6.144 MHz. The conversion time is selected via the channel conversion time register.  \n \n \nTable 5.

A | Page 14 of 32 REGISTER ACCESS  \nThe AD7739 is configurable through a series of registers. Some \nof them configure and control general AD7739 features, wh ile \nothers are specific to each channel. The register data widths \nvary from 8 bits to 24 bits. All registers are accessed through the communications register , that is , any communication to the \nAD7 739 must start with a write to the communications register \nspecifying which register is  subsequently read or written.  \nCOMMUNICATIONS REGISTER  \n8 Bits, Write -Only Register, Address 0x00  \nAll communications to the part must start with a write operation  to \nthe communications register  (see Table 14 and Table 15). The \ndata written to the communi cations register determines whether   the subsequent operation  is a read or write and to which register \nthis operation is directed.  The digital interface defaults to expect \na write oper ation to the communications register after power -\non, afte r reset, or after the subsequent read  or write operation to \nthe selected register is complete. If the interface sequence is lost, the part can be reset by writing at least 32 serial clock cycles \nwith DIN high and \nCS low. (Note that all of  the parts, including \nthe modulator, filter, interface, and all registers are reset in this \ncase.) Remember to keep DIN low while reading 32 bits or more either in continuous  read mode or with the d ump  bit and 24/16 \nbit in the mode register set.  \nTable 14.

For channel specific registers, the \nthree LSBs, that is , Bit 2, Bit 1 , and Bit 0 , specify the channel number. When the subsequent operation writes  \nto the mode register, the three LSBs specify the channel selected for the operation determined by the mode \nregister value.

This \nregister can be used to correctly identify the ADC, or as a check to ensure that serial comm unication is working correctly .  \nTEST REGISTER  \n24 Bits, Read/Write Register,  Address 0x03  \nThis register  is used for testing the part in the manufacturing \nprocess. The user must not change the default configuration of this register.  ADC STATUS REGISTER  \n8 Bits, Read -Only Register, Address 0x04, Default Value 0x00 \nIn conversion modes, the register bits reflect the individual channel status. When a conversion is complete, the corresponding  \nchannel data register is updated and the corresponding RDY bit \nis set to 1. When the channel d ata register is read, the corre -\nsponding bit is reset to  0. The bit is reset to 0 also when no read \noperation has taken place and the result of the next conversion \nis being updated to the channel data register. Writing to the mode register resets all the bits to 0. \nIn calibration modes, all the register bits are reset to 0 while a \ncalibration is in progress; all the register bits are set to 1 when \nthe calibration is complete.  \nThe \nRDY  pin output is related to the content of the ADC status \nregister as defined by the RDYFN bit  in the I/O port register. \nThe RDY0 bit corresponds to Channel 0, the RDY1 bit corresponds to Channel 1, and so on  (see Table 20). \nTable 16.

When set to 1, the \ncorresponding pin is an input; when reset to 0, the corresponding pin is an output.  \n3 RDYFN  This bit is used to control the function of the RDY  pin on the AD7739. When this bit is reset to 0, the RDY  pin \ngoes low when any channel has unread data. When this bit is set to 1, the RDY  pin goes low only if all enabled \nchannels have unread data.  \n2 REDPWR  Red uced power. If this bit is set to 1, the AD7739 works in the reduced power mode. The maximum MCLK \nfrequency is limited to 4 MHz in the reduced power mode.  \n1 0 This bit must be 0 for proper operation.  \n0 Sync This bit enables the SYNC  pin function. By default, this bit is 0 and SYNC /P1 can be used as a digital I/O pin. \nWhen the s ync bit is set to 1, the SYNC  pin can be used to synchronize the AD7739 modulator and digital filter \nwith other devices in the system.  \nTable 18.

The  \nvalue in this register is used in co njunction with the value in the \nADC full -scale calibration register and the corresponding channel  \nzero -scale and channel full -scale calibration registers to  scale \ndigitally the conversion results of all channels. The value in this \nregister is updated  automatically following the execution of an \nADC zero -scale self -calibration. Writing this register is possible \nin the idle mode only (see the Calibration  section for  details).  \nADC FULL -SCALE CALIBRATION RE GISTER  \n24 Bits, Read/Write Register, Address 0x07, \nDefault  Value 0x80  0000  \nThis register holds the ADC full -scale calibration coefficient. \nThe value in this register is used in conjunction with the value in the ADC zero -scale and the corre sponding channel zero -scale \nand channel full -scale calibration registers to scale digitally the \nconversion results of all channels. The value in this register is \nupdated automatically following the execution of an ADC full -\nscale self -calibration. Writing this register is p ossible in the idle \nmode only. Use t he ADC full -scale self -calibration only on \n+2.5  V and ±2.5 V input voltage ranges (see the Calibration  \nsection for  details).  \nCHANNEL DATA REGISTE RS \n16- Bit/24- Bit, Read -Only Registers, Address 0x08  to \nAddress  0x0F, Default Width 16 Bits, Default Value 0x8000 \nThese registers contain the most up -to-date conversion results \ncorresponding to each analog i nput channel. The 16 -bit or \n24-bit data width can be configured by setting the 24/16 bit in \nthe mode register. The relevant RDY bit in the channel status \nregister goes high when the result is updated. The RDY bit \nreturns  low once the data register reading begins . The RDY  pin \ncan be configured to indicate when any channel has unread data \nor to wait until all enabled channels have unread data. If any \nchannel data register read operation is in progress when a new result is updated, no update of the data register occurs . This \navoids having corrupted data.

When this bit is set to 1, the master clock is disabled  from appearing at the \nMCLKOUT pin and the MCLKOUT pin is in a high impedance state. This allows turning off the MCLKOUT as a \npower saving feature. When using an external clock on MCLKIN, the AD77 39 continues to have internal clocks \nand converts  normally regardless of the CLKDIS bit state. When using a crystal oscillator or ceramic resonator \nacross the MCLKIN and MCLKOUT pins, the AD7739 clock is stopped and no conversions can take place when the \nCLKDIS bit is active. The AD7739 digital interface can still be accessed using the SCLK pin.  \n3 Dump  Dump mode. When this bit is reset  to 0, the channel status register and channel data register are addressed and \nread separately. When the d ump bit is set to 1, the channel status register is followed immediately by a  read of \nthe channel data register regardless of whether the status or da ta register has been addressed through the \ncommunications register. The continuous read mode is always dump mode reading the channel status and \nchannel data registers, regardless of the d ump bit value (see the Digital Interface Descrip tion  section for  details).  \n2 Cont RD  When this bit is set to 1, the AD7739 operates in the continuous read mode (see the Digital Interface Description  \nsection for details).  \n1 24/16 bit  Channel data register data width selection bit.

When the c lamp bit is set to 1, the channel data register is digitally clamped to either all 0s \nor all 1s when the analog input voltage goes outside the nominal input voltage range. When the c lamp bit is \nreset to 0, the data registers reflect the analog input voltage even outside the nominal voltage range (see th e \nExtended Voltage Range of the Analog  Input  section).  \nTable 29.

After the conversion is complete, the \nrelevant channel data register and channel status register are updated, the relevant RDY bit in the ADC s tatus register is set, and the AD7739\n continues converting on the next enabled channel.

A | Page 21 of 32 DIGITAL INTERFACE DESCRIPTION \nHARDWARE  \nThe AD7739 serial interface can be connected to the host \ndevice via the serial interface in several different ways.  \nThe CS pin can b e used to select the AD7739 as one of several \ncircuits connected to the host serial interface. When CS is high, \nthe AD7739 ignores the SCLK and DIN signals and the DOUT \npin goes to the high impedance state. When the CS signal is not \nused, connect the CS pin to DGND.  \nThe RDY  pin can be polled  for high -to-low transition or can \ndrive the host device interrupt input to indicate that the \nAD7739 has finished the selected operation and/or new data \nfrom the AD7739 is available. The host system can also wait a \ndesignated time after a given command is written to the device before reading. Alternatively, the AD7739 status can b e polled. \nWhen the \nRDY  pin is not used in the system, leave it  as an open \ncircuit. (Note that the RDY  pin is always an active digital \noutput, that is , it never goes into a high impedance state.)  \nThe RESET  pin can be used to reset the AD7739. When not \nused, connect this pin to DV DD. \nThe AD7739 interface can be reduced to just two wires c onnecting  \nthe DIN and DOUT pins to a single bidirectional data line. The \nsecond signal in this 2 -wire configuration is the SCLK signal. \nThe host system must  change the data line direction with \nreference to the AD7739 timing specification (see the Bus \nRelinquish Time in Table 2). The AD7739 cannot operat e in the \ncontinuous read mode in 2 -wire serial interface configuration.  \nAll the digital interface inputs are Schmitt triggered; therefore, \nthe AD7739 interface features higher noise immunity and c an \nbe easily isolated from the host system via optocouplers. Figure  12, \nFigure 13, and Figure 14 outline some of the possible host device \ninterfaces: SPI without using the CS signal (Figure 12), a DSP \ninterf ace ( Figure 13), and a 2 -wire configuration (Figure 14). \n \n  \nFigure 12.

A | Page 22 of 32 RESET  \nThe AD7739 can be reset by the RESET  pin or by writing a reset \nsequence to the AD7739 serial interface. The reset sequence is  \nN × 0 + 32 × 1, which c an be the data sequence 0x00 +  0xFF + \n0xFF + 0xFF + 0xFF in a byte -oriented interface.  \nThe AD7739 also features a power -on reset with a trip point  \nof 2 V and goes to the defined default state after power -on. \nIt is the responsibility of the system designer  to prevent an \nunwanted write ope ration to the AD7739. The unwanted write \noperation c an happen when a spurious clock appears on the \nSCLK while the CS pin is low. Note that if the AD7739 interface \nsignals are floating or undefined at system power -on, the part \ncan be inadvertently configured into an unknown state. This \ncan be easily overcome by initiating either a hardware reset \nevent or a 32 ones reset sequence as the first step in the system \nconfiguration.  \nACCESS THE AD7739 RE GISTERS  \nAll communications to the part start with a write operation to \nthe communications register followed by either reading or writing  \nthe addressed register. In a simultaneous rea d-write interface \n(such as SPI), write 0 to the AD7739 while reading data.  \nFigure 15 shows the AD7739 interface read sequence for the \nADC status register. SINGLE CONVERSION AN D READING DATA  \nWhen the mode register is being written, the ADC status byte  \nis cleared and the RDY  pin goes hig h, regardless of its previous \nstate. When the single conversion command is written to the \nmode register, the ADC starts the conversion on the channel selected by the address  of the mode register. After the conversion  \nis completed, the data register is upda ted, the mode register is \nchanged to idle mode , the relevant RDY bit is set, and the \nRDY  \npin goes low. The RDY bit is reset and the RDY  pin returns high \nwhen the relevant channel data register is being read.  \nFigure 16 shows the digital interface signals executing a single \nconversion on Channel 0, waiting for the RDY  pin to go low, \nand reading the Channel 0 data register.  \nDUMP MODE  \nWhen the d ump  bit in the mode register is set to 1, the channel \nstatus register is  read immediately by a read of the channel data \nregister, regardless of whether the status or the data regi ster is \naddressed through the communications register. The DIN pin must  not be high while reading 24 -bit data in dump mode; \notherwise, the AD7739 is reset.  \nFigure 17 shows the digital interface signals executing a single \nconversion on Channel 0, waiting for the \nRDY  pin to go low, \nand reading the Channel 0 status register and data register in \nthe dump mode.  \n \n \nFigure 16.

A | Page 23 of 32 CONTINUOUS CONVERSIO N MODE  \nWhen the mode register is being written, the ADC status byte is \ncleared and the RDY  pin goes high, regardless of its previous \nstate. When the continuous conversion command is written to \nthe mode register, the ADC starts conversion on the channel \nselected by the address of the mode register.  \nAfter the conversion is complete, the relevant  channel data \nregister and channel status register are updated, the relevant \nRDY bit in the ADC status register is set, and the AD7739 continues converting on the next enabled channel. The part cycles  through all enabled channels until put into another mode \nor reset. The cycle period is  the sum of all conversion times of \nenabled channels , set by the corresponding channel conversion \ntime registers.  \nThe RDY bit is reset when the relevant channel da ta register is \nbeing read. The behavior of the \nRDY  pin depends on the \nRDYFN bit in the I/O port register. When the RDYFN bit is 0, \nthe RDY  pin goes low when any channel has unread data. When \nthe RDYFN bit is set to 1, th e RDY  pin goes  low only if all \nenabled channels have unread data.  If an ADC conversion result is not  read before a new ADC \nconversion is completed, the new result overwrites  the previous \none. The relevant RDY bit goes low and the RDY  pin goes high \nfor at least 163 MCLK cycles (~26.5 µs), indicating when the data  \nregister is updated, and the previous conversion data is lost.  \nIf the data register is being read as an ADC conversion completes,  \nthe data register is not  update d with the new result (to avoid \ndata corr uption) and the new conversion data is lost.  \nFigure 18 shows the sequence of the digital interf ace signal for \nthe continuous co nversion mode with Channels 0 and 1 enabled \nand the RDYFN bit set to 0. The RDY  pin goes low and the data \nregister is read after each conversion. Figure 19 shows a similar \nsequence but with the RDYFN bit set to 1. The RDY  pin goes \nlow and all data registers are read after all conversions are completed. Figure 20 shows the \nRDY  pin when no data is read \nfrom the AD7739.  \n \n \nFigure 18.

A | Page 24 of 32 CONTINUOUS READ (CONTINUOU S CONVERSION) \nMODE  \nWhen the Cont RD bit in the mode register is set, the first write \nof 0x48 to the communications register starts the continuous \nread mode. As shown in Figure 21, subsequent accesses to the \npart sequentially read the channel status and data registers of the last completed conversion without any further configuration of the communications register being required.  \nNote that the continuou s conversion bit in the mode register \nmust  be set when entering the continuous read mode.  \nNote that the continuous read mode is a dump mode reading of the channel status and data registers regardless of the dump bit value. Use the channel bits in the chann el status register to \ncheck/recognize which channel data is actually being  \nshifted out.  Note that the last completed conversion result is being read. \nTherefore, the RDYFN bit in the I/O port register must  be 0, \nand reading the result must  always start before the next \nconversion is completed.  \nThe AD7739 stays  in continuous read mode as long as the DIN \npin is low while the \nCS pin is low; therefore, write 0 to the AD7739 \nwhile reading in continuous read mode. To exit continuous read mode, take the DIN pin high for at least 100 ns after a read is \ncomplete. (Write 0x80 to the AD7739 to exit continuous reading.)  \nTaking the DIN pin high does not change the Cont RD bit in \nthe mode register. Therefore, the next write of 0x48 starts the \ncontinuous read mode again. To complete ly stop the continuous \nread mode, write to the mode register to clear the Cont RD bit.  \n \n \n \nFigure 21.

A | Page 25 of 32 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD7739 is a high precision analog -to-digital converter that \nis intended for the measurement of wide dynamic range, low \nfrequency signals in industrial process control, instrumentation, and PL C systems.  \nIt contains a multiplexer, an input buffer, a Σ -Δ (or charge \nbalancing) ADC, a digit al filter, a clock oscillator, a digital  \nI/O port, and a serial communications interface.  \nANALOG INPUTS  \nThe AD7739 has nine analog input pins connected to the ADC \nthrough the internal multiplexer. The analog front end can be configured as eight single -ended inputs or four differential \ninputs or any combination of these (via the channel setup registers). \nThe AD7739 contains a wide bandwidth, fast settling time \ndifferential input buffer capable of driving the dynamic load of \na high speed Σ -Δ modulator. With the internal buffer enabled, \nthe analog i nputs feature high input impedance.  \nIf chopping is enabled or when switching between channels, \nthere is a dynamic current on analog inputs charging the \ninternal capacitance of the multiplexer and input buffer. The \ncapacitance is approximately 10 pF.  \nAt th e start of each conversion, there is a delay to allow the \ncapacitance to be charged (see the Multiplexer, Conversion, and \nData Output  Timing  section). If the analog inpu ts resistive \nsource impedance does not exceed 50  kΩ, the internal \ncapacitance is charged fast enough and the AD7739 performance is not affected at the 16 -bit level.  \nAn external RC filter connected  to the analog inputs averages  \nthe multiplexer channel -to-channel switching dynamic currents to a dc current leading to a dc voltage drop across the external input resistance. To avoid additional gain errors, offset errors, and channel -to-channel crosstalk due to this effect, use low \nresistor values in the low -pass RC filter for the AD7739. The \nrecommended low -pass RC filter for the analog inputs is 100 Ω  \nand 100 nF.  \nThe average (dc) current, charging the capacitance on the \nmultiplexer output, is related to the equation:  \nI ≈ C\nMUX × VMUX × fS  \nwhere:  \nCMUX is the capacitance on the multiple xer output, \napprox imately 10 pF . \nVMUX is the voltage difference on the multiplexer output \nbetween two subsequent conversions, which can be up to  5 V. \nfS is the channel sampling frequency, which relates to the sum of \nconversion times on all subsequently sampled channels. \nSIGMA -DELTA ADC  \nThe AD7739 core consists of a charge balancing Σ-Δ modulator \nand a digital filter. The architecture is optimized for fast, fully settled conversion. This allows for fast channel- to-channel \nswitching while maintaining inherently excellent linearity, high \nresolution, and low noise.  \nCHOPPING  \nWith chopping ena bled, the multiplexer repeatedly reverses the \nADC inputs. Every output data result is then calculated as an \naverage of two conversions, the first with the positive and the second with the negative offset term included. This effectively \nremoves any offset error of the input buffer and Σ -Δ modulator. \nFigure 22 shows the channel signal chain with chopping enabled.  \n \n \nFigure 22.

A | Page 26 of 32 MULTIPLEXER, CONVERS ION, AND DATA \nOUTPUT  TIMING  \nThe specified conversion time includes one or two settling and \nsampling periods and a scaling time.  \nWith chopping enabled ( Figure 23), a conversion cycle starts \nwith a  settling time of 43 MCLK cycles or 44 MCLK cycles  \n(~7 µs with a 6.144 MHz MCLK) to allow the circuits following \nthe multiplexer to settle. The Σ -Δ modulator then samples the \nanalog signals and the digital filter processes the digital data stream. The sam pling time depends on FW , that is , on the \nchannel conversion time register contents. After another \nsettling of 42 MCLK cycles (~6.8 µs), the sampling time is repeated with a reversed (chopped) analog input signal. Then, \nduring the scaling time of 163 MCLK cycles (~26.5 µs), the  \ntwo results from the digital filter are averaged, scaled using the \ncalibration registers, and written into the channel data register.  With chopping disabled ( Figure 24), only one sampling time is \npreceded by a settling time of 43 MCLK or 44 MCLK cycles and followed by a scaling time of 163 MCLK cycles.  \nThe \nRDY  pin goes high during the scaling time, regardless of its \nprevious sta te. The relevant RDY bit is set in the ADC status \nregister and in the channel status register, and the RDY  pin goes \nlow when the channel data register is updated and the channel \nconversion cycle is finished. If in continuous conversion mo de, \nthe part automatically continue s with a conversion cycle on the \nnext enabled channel.  \nNote that every channel can be configured independently for conversion time and chopping mode. The overall cycle and \neffective per channel data rates depend on all enabled  \nchannel settings.  \n \n \nFigure 23.

A | Page 27 of 32 FREQUENCY RESPONSE  \nThe Σ-Δ modulator runs at ½ the MCLK frequency, which is \neffectively the sampling frequency. Therefore, the modulator \nNyquist frequency is ¼ of the MCL K.  \nIf chopping is enabled, the input signal is resampled by \nchopping. Therefore, the overall frequency response features \nnotches close to the frequency of 1/channel conversion time.  \nThe typical ADC frequency response plots are given in Figure  25 and Figure 26. The plots are normalized to 1/channel \nconversion time.  \nNote that these figures apply to each channel separately and are based on individual channel conversion time. The signal is effectively resampled once more in the multiplexer by switching \nbetween enabled analog inputs.  \n \n \nFigure 25. Typical ADC Frequ ency Response, Chopping Enabled  \n \nFigure 26. Typical ADC Frequency Response, Chopping Disabled  \n \n EXTENDED VOLTAGE RAN GE OF THE  \nANALOG  INPUT \nThe AD7739 output data code span corresponds to the nominal \ninput voltage range. The ADC is functional outside the nominal \ninput voltage range, but the performance might degrade. The Σ-Δ modulator was designed to fully cover 16% analog input \noverrange; outside this ra nge, the performance might degrade \nmore rapidly.  \nWhen the c lamp  bit in the mode register is set to 1, the channel \ndata register is  digitally clamped  to either all 0s or all 1s when the  \nanalog input voltage goes outside the nominal input voltage range.   \nAs shown in Table 30 and Table 31, when c lamp  = 0, the data \nreflects the analog input voltage outside the nominal voltage range. In this case, the sign  and OVR bits in the channel status \nregister must  be considered along with the data register value to \ndecode the actual conversion result.  \nNote that the OVR bit in the channel status register is generated digitally from the conversion result and indicates the Σ -Δ mod-\nulator (nominal) overrange. The OVR bit does not  indicate \nexceeding the absolute voltage limits  of the AIN pin . \nTable 30.

A | Page 28 of 32 VOLTAGE REFERENCE IN PUTS  \nThe AD7739 has a differential reference input, REF IN(+) and \nREF IN( −). The common -mode range for these inputs is from \nAGND to AV DD. The nominal differential reference voltage for \nspecified operation is  2.5 V . Both reference inputs feature dynamic  \nload. Therefore, connect the reference inputs to a low impedance  \nreference voltage source. External resistance/capacitance \ncombinations may result in gain errors on the part.  \nThe output noise performance outlin ed in Table 5 through \nTable 10 is for an analog input of 0 V and is unaffected by noise \non the reference. Obtaining the same noise performance as shown in the noise tables over the full input range requires a low noise reference source for the AD7739. If the reference noise in  the bandwidth of interest is excessive, it degrade s the \nperformance of the AD7739. \nRecommended reference voltage sources for the AD7739 \ninclude the ADR431, ADR421, AD780, REF43 , and REF192. \nREFERENCE DETECT  \nThe AD7739 includes on -chip circuitry to de tect if the part has \na valid reference for conversions. If the voltage between the \nREFIN(+) and REFIN( −) pins goes below the NOREF trigger \nvoltage (0.5 V typ.) and the AD7739 is performing a conve rsion, \nthe NOREF bit in the channel status register is set.  \nI/O PORT  \nThe AD7739 P0 pin can be used as a general -purpose digital \noutput or as a common analog input.  \nThe P1 pin ( SYNC /P1) can be used as a general -purpose digital \nI/O pin or to synchronize the AD7739 with other d evices in the \nsystem. When the sync  bit in the I/O port register is set and \nthe SYNC  pin is low, the AD7739 does not process any \nconversion. If it is put into single conversion mode, continuous \nconversion mode, or any calibration mode, the AD7739 waits \nuntil the SYNC  pin goes high and then starts operation. This \nallows conversion to start from a known point in time, that is,  \nthe rising edge of the SYNC  pin. When configured as input,  \nthe SYNC  pin must  be tied high or low.  \nThe digital P0 and P1 voltage is referenced to the analog supplies.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CALIBRATION  \nThe AD7739 provides zero -scale self -calibration, and zero - and \nfull-scale system calibration capability that can effectively \nreduce the offset error and gain error to the order of the noise. \nAfter each conversion, the ADC conversion result is scaled using the ADC ca libration registers and the relevant channel \ncalibration registers before being written to the data register.  \nFor unipo lar ranges,  \nData  = ((ADC Result  − R × ADC ZS Cal ibration Register ) ×  \nADC FS Register /(0x20 0000 ) − R ×  \nChannel  ZS Cal ibration  Register ) ×  \nChannel  FS Cal ibration  Register /(0x20  0000 ) \nFor bipolar ranges,  \nData  = ((ADC R esult  − R × ADC ZS Calibration Register ) ×  \nADC FS Register /(0x40 0000 ) + (0x80 0000 ) − R ×  \nChannel  ZS Cal ibration  Register ) ×  \nChannel  FS Cal ibration  Register /(0x20  0000 ) \nwhere : \nThe ADC Result  is in the range of 0  to 0xFF FFFF .  \nR = 1 for input ranges +1.25 V , ±1.25 V , +2.5 V , and ±2.5 V , and \nR = 2 for input ranges +0.625 V , and ±0.625 V . \nNote that the channel zero -scale calibration register has the \nformat of a sign bit and  a 22-bit channel offset value.  \nTo start any calibration, write the relevant mode bits to the AD7739 mode register. After the calibration is complete, the \ncontents of the corresponding calibration  registers are updated, \nall RDY bits in the ADC status register are set, the \nSYNC  pin \ngoes low, and the AD7739 reverts to idle mode. The calibration \nduration is the same as the c onversion time configured on the \nselected channel. A longer conversion time gives less noise and \nyields a more exact calibration; therefore, use at least the default \nconversion time to initiate any calibration.  \nADC Zero- Scale Self -Calibration  \nThe ADC zero -scale self -calibration can reduce the ADC offset \nerror in the chopping disabled mode. If repeated after a \ntemperature change, it can also reduce the offset drift error in \nthe chopping disabled mode.  \nThe zero -scale self -calibration is performed on internall y shorted  \nADC inputs. The negative analog input terminal on the selected \nchannel is used to set the ADC zero -scale calibration common \nmode. Therefore, either the negative terminal of the selected differential pair or the AINCOM on the single -ended channel \nconfiguration must  be driven to a proper common -mode voltage.  \nIt is recommended that the ADC zero -scale calibration register \nbe updated only as part of an ADC zero -scale self -calibration.  \n \n \nData Sheet  AD7739  \n \nRev. A | Page 29 of 32 ADC Full -Scale Self -Calibration  \nThe ADC full -scale self -calibration can reduce the ADC full -\nscale error for the + 2.5 V and ± 2.5 V input range. If repeated \nafter a temperature change, it can also reduce the full -scale drift.  \nThe ADC full -scale self -calibration is performed with a + 2.5 V \ninput voltage range on internally generated full -scale voltage \n(V REF), regardless of the input voltage range set in the channel \nsetup register. Full -scale errors in the ± 1.25 V , + 1.25 V , ±0.625  V, \nand +0.625 V ranges are not calibrated as this require s an \naccurate low voltage source other than the reference.  \nIf the 1.25 V or 0.625 V ranges are used on any channel, the \nADC full -scale self -calibration is not recommended. Pe rform  \na system full- scale calibration if accurate gains need to be \nachieved on these r anges.  \nIt is recommended that the ADC full -scale calibration register \nbe updated only as part of an ADC full -scale self -calibration for \nthe +2.5 V and ± 2.5 V input range.  \nPer Channel System Calibration  \nThe per channel system calibration can reduce the sys tem offset \nerror and the system gain error. If repeated after a temperature change, it can also reduce the system offset and gain drifts.  If the per channel system calibrations are used, initiate these  in \nthe following order: a channel zero -scale system ca libration, \nfollowed by a channel full -scale system calibration.  \nThe system calibration is affected by the ADC zero -scale and \nfull-scale calibration registers. Therefore, if both self -calibration \nand system calibration are used in the system, perform an ADC  \nself-calibration first, followed by a system calibration cycle. \nSet the voltage range in the channel setup register before executing the channel system calibration.  \nWhile executing a system calibration, the fully settled system zero -scale voltage signal o r system full -scale voltage signal must \nbe connected to the selected channel analog inputs.  \nThe per channel calibration registers can be read, stored, or modified and written back to the AD7739. N ote that when \nwriting the calibration registers, the AD7739 must be in idle \nmode. Note that outside the specified calibration range, calibration is possible, but the performance may degrade  \n(see the System Calibration section in Table 1).  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 27.
