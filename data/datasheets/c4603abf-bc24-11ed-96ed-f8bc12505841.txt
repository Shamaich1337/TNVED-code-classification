TheDS3234 incorporates a precision, temperature-compen-sated voltage reference and comparator circuit to monitorV\nCC. When V CCdrops below the power-fail voltage (V PF),\nthe device asserts the RST output and also disables read\nand write access to the part when V CCdrops below both\nVPFand V BAT. The RST pin is monitored as a pushbutton\ninput for generating a µP reset. The device switches to thebackup supply input and maintains accurate timekeepingwhen main power to the device is interrupted. The integra-tion of the crystal resonator enhances the long-term accu-racy of the device as well as reduces the piece-part countin a manufacturing line. The DS3234 is available in com-mercial and industrial temperature ranges, and is offeredin an industry-standard 300-mil, 20-pin SO package.\nThe DS3234 also integrates 256 bytes of battery-backed\nSRAM. In the event of main power loss, the contents ofthe memory are maintained by the power source con-nected to the V\nBAT pin. The RTC maintains seconds,\nminutes, hours, day, date, month, and year information.The date at the end of the month is automatically adjust-ed for months with fewer than 31 days, including correc-tions for leap year. The clock operates in either the24-hour or 12-hour format with AM/PM indicator. Two\nprogrammable time-of-day alarms and a programmablesquare-wave output are provided. Address and dataare transferred serially by an SPI bidirectional bus.\nApplications\nServers Utility Power Meters\nTelematics GPSBenefits and Features\n•Highly Accurate RTC with Integrated Crystal and\nSRAM Completely Manages All TimekeepingFunctions \n•Accuracy ±2ppm from 0°C to +40°C\n•Accuracy ±3.5ppm from -40°C to +85°C\n•Real-Time Clock Counts Seconds, Minutes, Hours,Day, Date, Month, and Year, with Leap YearCompensation Valid Up to 2099\n•Digital Temp Sensor Output: ±3°C Accuracy\n•Register for Aging Trim\n•RST Input/Output\n•Two Time-of-Day Alarms\n•Programmable Square-Wave Output\n•Simple Serial Interface Connects to Most\nMicrocontrollers\n•4MHz SPI Bus Supports Modes 1 and 3\n•Battery-Backup Input for Continuous Timekeeping\n•Low Power Operation Extends Battery Backup RunTime\n•Operating Temperature Ranges: Commercial: 0°C to+70°C, Industrial: -40°C to +85°C\n•300-Mil, 20-Pin SO Package\n•Underwriters Laboratories ®(UL) Recognized\n19-5339; Rev 4; 3/15Ordering Information\nPART TEMP RANGE PIN-\nPACKAGE TOP  \nMARK \nDS3234S#    0°C to +70°C 20 SO DS3234S \nDS3234SN# -40°C to +85°C 20 SO DS3234SN \nDS3234CS\nINT/SQW\n32kHz\nVBAT\nPUSH- \nBUTTON\nRESETSCLK\nRST\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.VCC VPU\nVCC\nGNDVCC\nµPSS\nSCLK\nDIN MOSI\nDOUT MISO\nRST\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.N.C.Typical Operating Circuit#Denotes an RoHS-compliant device that may include lead(Pb)\nthat is exempt under the RoHS requirements.

It can be\nleft open if not used. This multifunction pin is determined by the state of the INTCN bit in the Control Register\n(0Eh). When INTCN is set to logic 0, this pin outputs a square wave and its frequency is determined by RS2\nand RS1 bits. When INTCN is set to logic 1, then a match between the timekeeping registers and either of the\nalarm registers activates the INT/SQW pin (if the alarm is enabled). Because the INTCN bit is set to logic 1\nwhen power is first applied, the pin defaults to an interrupt output with alarms disabled. The pullup voltage can\nbe up to 5.5V, regardless of the voltage on V CC. If not used, this pin can be left unconnected.\n6 RSTActive-Low Reset. This pin is an open-drain input/output. It indicates the status of V CC relative to the\nVPF specification. As V CC falls below V PF, the RST pin is driven low. When V CC exceeds V PF, for t RST, the RST\npin is driven high impedance. The active-low, open-drain output is combined with a debounced pushbutton\ninput function. This pin can be activated by a pushbutton reset request. It has an internal 50k _ nominal value\npullup resistor to V CC. No external pullup resistors should be connected. On first power-up, or if the crystal\noscillator is disabled, t RST is bypassed and RST immediately goes high.\n15 GND Ground\n16 V BATBackup Power-Supply Input.

An integrated sensor periodi-cally samples the temperature and adjusts the oscilla-tor load to compensate for crystal drift caused bytemperature variations. The DS3234 provides user-selectable sample rates. This allows the user to selecta temperature sensor sample rate that allows for vari-ous temperature rates of change, while minimizing cur-rent consumption by temperature sensor sampling. Theuser should select a sample rate based upon theexpected temperature rate of change, with faster sam-\nple rates for applications where the ambient tempera-ture changes significantly over a short time. The TCXOprovides a stable and accurate reference clock, andmaintains the RTC to within ±2 minutes per year accu-racy from -40°C to +85°C. The TCXO frequency outputis available at the 32kHz pin. The RTC is a low-powerclock/calendar with two programmable time-of-dayalarms and a programmable square-wave output. TheINT/SQW provides either an interrupt signal due to\nalarm conditions or a square-wave output. Theclock/calendar provides seconds, minutes, hours, day,\nDS3234 Extremely Accurate SPI Bus RTC\nwith Integrated Crystal and SRAM \nMaxim Integrated  |  10 www.maximintegrated.comdate, month, and year information. The date at the end\nof the month is automatically adjusted for months withfewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year.The clock operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour for-mat with AM/PM indicator. Access to the internal regis-\nters is possible through an SPI bus interface.\nA temperature-compensated voltage reference and\ncomparator circuit monitors the level of V\nCCto detect\npower failures and to automatically switch to the backupsupply when necessary. When operating from the back-up supply, access is inhibited to minimize supply cur-rent. Oscillator, time and date, and TCXO operations cancontinue while the backup supply powers the device.The RST pin provides an external pushbutton function\nand acts as an indicator of a power-fail event.\nOperation\nThe block diagram shows the main elements of theDS3234. The eight blocks can be grouped into fourfunctional groups: TCXO, power control, pushbuttonfunction, and RTC. Their operations are described sep-arately in the following sections.\n32kHz TCXO\nThe temperature sensor, oscillator, and control logicform the TCXO. The controller reads the output of theon-chip temperature sensor and uses a lookup table todetermine the capacitance required, adds the agingcorrection in the AGE register, and then sets thecapacitance selection registers. New values, includingchanges to the AGE register, are loaded only when achange in the temperature value occurs. The tempera-ture is read on initial application of V\nCCand once every\n64 seconds (default, see the description for CRATE1and CRATE0 in the \nControl/Status Register section)\nafterwards.\nPower Control\nThe power control function is provided by a tempera-ture-compensated voltage reference and a comparatorcircuit that monitors the V\nCClevel. The device is fully\naccessible and data can be written and read when V CC\nis greater than V PF. However, when V CCfalls below\nboth V PFand V BAT, the internal clock registers are\nblocked from any access. If V PFis less than V BAT, the\ndevice power is switched from V CCto VBATwhen V CC\ndrops below V PF. If V PFis greater than V BAT, the\ndevice power is switched from V CCto VBATwhen V CC\ndrops below V BAT. After V CCreturns above both V PF\nand V BAT, read and write access is allowed after RST\ngoes high (Table 1).\nTo preserve the battery, the first time V BATis applied to\nthe device, the oscillator does not start up until V CCcrosses V PF. After the first time V CCis ramped up, the\noscillator starts up and the V BAT source powers the\noscillator during power-down and keeps the oscillatorrunning. When the DS3234 switches to V\nBAT, the oscil-\nlator may be disabled by setting the EOSC bit.\nVBATOperation\nThere are several modes of operation that affect the\namount of V BATcurrent that is drawn. When the part is\npowered by V BAT, timekeeping current (I BATT ), which\nincludes the averaged temperature conversion current,I\nBATTC , is drawn (refer to Application Note 3644: Power\nConsiderations for Accurate Real-Time Clocks for\ndetails). Temperature conversion current, I BATTC , is\nspecified since the system must be able to support theperiodic higher current pulse and still maintain a validvoltage level. Data retention current, I\nBATTDR , is the\ncurrent drawn by the part when the oscillator isstopped ( EOSC = 1). This mode can be used to mini-\nmize battery requirements for times when maintainingtime and date information is not necessary, e.g., whilethe end system is waiting to be shipped to a customer.\nPushbutton Reset Function\nThe DS3234 provides for a pushbutton switch to beconnected to the RST output pin. When the DS3234 is\nnot in a reset cycle, it continuously monitors the RST\nsignal for a low going edge. If an edge transition isdetected, the DS3234 debounces the switch by pullingthe RST low. After the internal timer has expired\n(PB\nDB), the DS3234 continues to monitor the RST line.\nIf the line is still low, the DS3234 continuously monitorsthe line looking for a rising edge. Upon detectingrelease, the DS3234 forces the RST pin low and holds it\nlow for t\nRST.\nThe same pin, RST, is used to indicate a power-fail\ncondition. When V CCis lower than V PF, an internal\npower-fail signal is generated, which forces the RST pin\nlow. When V CCreturns to a level above V PF, the RST\npin is held low for t RECto allow the power supply to sta-\nbilize. If the EOSC bit is set to logic 1 (to disable the\noscillator in battery-backup mode), t REC is bypassed\nand RST immediately goes high.SUPPLY CONDITIONREAD/WRITE\nACCE SSACTIVE\nSUPPLYRST\nVCC < V PF, VCC < V BAT No V BAT Active\nVCC < V PF, VCC > V BAT Yes V CC Active\nVCC > V PF, VCC < V BAT Yes V CC Inactive\nVCC > V PF, VCC > V BAT Yes V CC InactiveTable 1.

When RST is active due\nto a pushbutton event, it does not affect the operationof the TCXO, SPI interface, or RTC functions.\nReal-Time Clock\nWith the clock source from the TCXO, the RTC providesseconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and yearinformation. The date at the end of the month is auto-matically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days,including corrections for leap year. The clock operatesin either the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM\nindicator.\nThe clock provides two programmable time-of-day\nalarms and a programmable square-wave output. TheINT/SQW pin either generates an interrupt due to alarm\ncondition or outputs a square-wave signal and theselection is controlled by the bit INTCN.\nSRAM\nThe DS3234 provides 256 bytes of general-purposebattery-backed read/write memory. The SRAM can bewritten or read whenever V\nCCis above either V PFor\nVBAT.\nAddress Map\nFigure 1 shows the address map for the DS3234 time-keeping registers. During a multibyte access, when theaddress pointer reaches the end of the register space(13h read, 93h write), it wraps around to the beginning(00h read, 80h write). The DS3234 does not respond toa read or write to any reserved address, and the inter-nal address pointer does not increment. Address point-er operation when accessing the 256-byte SRAM datais covered in the description of the SRAM address anddata registers. On the falling edge of CS, or during a\nmultibyte access when the address pointer incrementsto location 00h, the current time is transferred to a sec-ond set of registers. The time information is read fromthese secondary registers, while the internal clock reg-isters continue to increment normally. If the time anddate registers are read using a multibyte read, thiseliminates the need to reread the registers in case themain registers update during a read.SPI Interface\nThe DS3234 operates as a slave device on the SPI seri-al bus. Access is obtained by selecting the part by theCSpin and clocking data into/out of the part using the\nSCLK and DIN/DOUT pins. Multiple byte transfers aresupported within one CSlow period. The SPI on the\nDS3234 interface is accessible whenever V\nCCis above\neither V BATor VPF.\nClock and Calendar\nThe time and calendar information is obtained by read-ing the appropriate register bytes. Figure 1 illustratesthe RTC registers. The time and calendar data are setor initialized by writing the appropriate register bytes.The contents of the time and calendar registers are inbinary-coded decimal (BCD) format. The DS3234 canbe run in either 12-hour or 24-hour mode. Bit 6 of thehours register is defined as the 12- or 24-hour modeselect bit. When high, 12-hour mode is selected. In 12-hour mode, bit 5 is the AM/PM bit with logic-high being\nPM. In 24-hour mode, bit 5 is the 20-hour bit (20–23hours). The century bit (bit 7 of the month register) istoggled when the years register overflows from 99 to00.\nThe day-of-week register increments at midnight.\nValues that correspond to the day of week are user-defined but must be sequential (i.e., if 1 equalsSunday, then 2 equals Monday, and so on). Illogicaltime and date entries result in undefined operation.\nWhen reading or writing the time and date registers,\nsecondary (user) buffers are used to prevent errorswhen the internal registers update. When reading thetime and date registers, the user buffers are synchro-nized to the internal registers on the falling edge of CS\nor and when the register pointer rolls over to zero. Thetime information is read from these secondary registers,while the clock continues to run. This eliminates theneed to reread the registers in case the main registersupdate during a read.\nThe countdown chain is reset whenever the seconds\nregister is written. Write transfers occur when the lastbit of a byte is clocked in. Once the countdown chain isreset, to avoid rollover issues the remaining time anddate registers must be written within 1 second. The 1Hzsquare-wave output, if enabled, transitions high 500msafter the seconds data transfer.\nDS3234 Extremely Accurate SPI Bus RTC\nwith Integrated Crystal and SRAM \nMaxim Integrated  |  12 www.maximintegrated.comFigure 1.

Alarm\n1 can be set by writing to registers 07h to 0Ah. Alarm 2can be set by writing to registers 0Bh to 0Dh. The alarmscan be programmed (by the alarm enable and INTCNbits of the control register) to activate the INT/SQW output\non an alarm match condition. Bit 7 of each of the time-of-day/date alarm registers are mask bits (Table 2). When allthe mask bits for each alarm are logic 0, an alarm onlyoccurs when the values in the timekeeping registersmatch the corresponding values stored in the time-of-day/date alarm registers. The alarms can also be pro-grammed to repeat every second, minute, hour, day, ordate. Table 2 shows the possible settings. Configurationsnot listed in the table will result in illogical operations.The DY/ DTbits (bit 6 of the alarm day/date registers)\ncontrol whether the alarm value stored in bits 0 to 5 ofthat register reflects the day of the week or the date ofthe month. If DY/ DTis written to logic 0, the alarm will\nbe the result of a match with date of the month. IfDY/DTis written to logic 1, the alarm will be the result of\na match with day of the week.\nWhen the RTC register values match alarm register set-\ntings, the corresponding Alarm Flag ‘A1F’ or ‘A2F’ bit isset to logic 1. If the corresponding Alarm InterruptEnable ‘A1IE’ or ‘A2IE’ is also set to logic 1 and theINTCN bit is set to logic 1, the alarm condition activatesthe INT/SQW signal. The match is tested on the once-\nper-second update of the time and date registers.\nTable 2.

When set to logic 0,\nthe oscillator is started. When set to logic 1, the oscilla-tor is stopped when the DS3234 switches to batterypower. This bit is clear (logic 0) when power is firstapplied. When the DS3234 is powered by V\nCC, the\noscillator is always on regardless of the status of theEOSC bit. When EOSC is disabled, all register data is\nstatic.\nBit 6: Battery-Backed Square-Wave Enable\n(BBSQW). When set to logic 1 with INTCN = 0 and V\nCC\n< VPF, this bit enables the square wave. When BBSQW\nis logic 0, the INT/SQW pin goes high impedance when\nVCC< VPF. This bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is\nfirst applied.\nBit 5: Convert Temperature (CONV). Setting this bit to\n1 forces the temperature sensor to convert the temper-ature into digital code and execute the TCXO algorithmto update the capacitance array to the oscillator. Thiscan only happen when a conversion is not already inprogress. The user should check the status bit BSYbefore forcing the controller to start a new TCXO exe-cution. A user-initiated temperature conversion doesnot affect the internal 64-second (default interval)update cycle. This bit is disabled (logic 0) when poweris first applied.\nA user-initiated temperature conversion does not affect\nthe BSY bit for approximately 2ms. The CONV bitremains at a 1 from the time it is written until the conver-sion is finished, at which time both CONV and BSY goto 0. The CONV bit should be used when monitoringthe status of a user-initiated conversion.Bits 4 and 3: Rate Select (R S2 and R S1). These bits\ncontrol the frequency of the square-wave output whenthe square wave has been enabled. The following tableshows the square-wave frequencies that can be select-ed with the RS bits. These bits are both set to logic 1(8.192kHz) when power is first applied.\nBit 2: Interrupt Control (INTCN). This bit controls the\nINT/SQW signal. When the INTCN bit is set to logic 0, a\nsquare wave is output on the INT/SQW pin. When the\nINTCN bit is set to logic 1, a match between the time-keeping registers and either of the alarm registers acti-vates the INT/SQW (if the alarm is also enabled). The\ncorresponding alarm flag is always set regardless ofthe state of the INTCN bit. The INTCN bit is set to logic1 when power is first applied.\nBit 1: Alarm 2 Interrupt Enable (A2IE). When set to\nlogic 1, this bit permits the alarm 2 flag (A2F) bit in thestatus register to assert INT/SQW (when INTCN = 1).\nWhen the A2IE bit is set to logic 0 or INTCN is set tologic 0, the A2F bit does not initiate an interrupt signal.The A2IE bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is firstapplied.\nBit 0: Alarm 1 Interrupt Enable (A1IE). When set to\nlogic 1, this bit permits the alarm 1 flag (A1F) bit in thestatus register to assert INT/SQW (when INTCN = 1).\nWhen the A1IE bit is set to logic 0 or INTCN is set tologic 0, the A1F bit does not initiate the INT/SQW sig-\nnal. The A1IE bit is disabled (logic 0) when power isfirst applied.BIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: EOSC BBSQW CONV RS2 RS1 INTCN A2IE A1IE\nPOR*: 00011100\nRS2R S1SQUARE-WAVE OUTPUT\nFREQUENCY\n0 0 1Hz\n0 1 1.024kHz\n1 0 4.096kHz\n1 1 8.192kHzSQUARE-WAVE OUTPUT FREQUENCYControl Register (0Eh/8Eh)\n*POR is defined as the first application of power to the device, either V BATor VCC.\nDS3234 Extremely Accurate SPI Bus RTC\nwith Integrated Crystal and SRAM \nMaxim Integrated  |  15 www.maximintegrated.comControl/Status Register (0Fh/8Fh)\nBit 7: Oscillator Stop Flag (O SF). A logic 1 in this bit\nindicates that the oscillator either is stopped or wasstopped for some period and may be used to judge thevalidity of the timekeeping data. This bit is set to logic 1any time that the oscillator stops. The following areexamples of conditions that can cause the OSF bit tobe set:\n1) The first time power is applied.2) The voltages present on both V\nCCand V BAT are\ninsufficient to support oscillation.\n3) The EOSC bit is turned off in battery-backed mode.\n4) External influences on the crystal (i.e., noise, leak-\nage, etc.).\nThis bit remains at logic 1 until written to logic 0.Bit 6: Battery-Backed 32kHz Output (BB32kHz). This\nbit enables the 32kHz output when powered from V\nBAT\n(provided EN32kHz is enabled). If BB32kHz = 0, the32kHz output is low when the part is powered by V\nBAT.\nThis bit is enabled (logic 1) when power is first applied.\nBits 5 and 4: Conversion Rate (CRATE1 and\nCRATE0). These two bits control the sample rate of the\nTCXO. The sample rate determines how often the tem-perature sensor makes a conversion and applies com-pensation to the oscillator. Decreasing the sample ratedecreases the overall power consumption by decreas-ing the frequency at which the temperature sensoroperates. However, significant temperature changesthat occur between samples may not be completelycompensated for, which reduce overall accuracy.These bits are set to logic 0 when power is first applied.Bit 3: Enable 32kHz Output (EN32kHz). This bit indi-\ncates the status of the 32kHz pin. When set to logic 1,the 32kHz pin is enabled and outputs a 32.768kHzsquare-wave signal. When set to logic 0, the 32kHz pin islow. The initial power-up state of this bit is logic 1, and a32.768kHz square-wave signal appears at the 32kHz pinafter a power source is applied to the DS3234. This bit isenabled (logic 1) when power is first applied.\nBit 2: Busy (B SY).This bit indicates the device is busy\nexecuting TCXO functions. It goes to logic 1 when theconversion signal to the temperature sensor is assertedand then is cleared when the conversion is complete.\nBit 1: Alarm 2 Flag (A2F). A logic 1 in the alarm 2 flag\nbit indicates that the time matched the alarm 2 regis-ters. If the A2IE bit and INTCN bit are set to logic 1, theINT/SQW pin is driven low while A2F is active. A2F is\ncleared when written to logic 0. This bit can only bewritten to logic 0. Attempting to write to logic 1 leavesthe value unchanged.\nBit 0: Alarm 1 Flag (A1F). A logic 1 in the alarm 1 flag\nbit indicates that the time matched the alarm 1 regis-ters. If the A1IE bit and the INTCN bit are set to logic 1,the INT/SQW pin is driven low while A1F is active. A1F\nis cleared when written to logic 0. This bit can only bewritten to logic 0. Attempting to write to logic 1 leavesthe value unchanged.BIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: OSF BB32kHz CRATE1 CRATE0 EN32kHz BSY A2F A1F \nPOR*: 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 Control/Status Register (0Fh/8Fh)\n*POR is defined as the first application of power to the device, either V BATor VCC.\nCRATE1 CRATE0SAMPLE RATE\n(seconds)\n00 6 4\n0 1 128\n1 0 256\n1 1 512\nDS3234 Extremely Accurate SPI Bus RTC\nwith Integrated Crystal and SRAM \nMaxim Integrated  |  16 www.maximintegrated.comAging Offset Register (10h/90h)\nThe aging offset register takes a user-provided value to\nadd to or subtract from the oscillator capacitor array.The data is encoded in two’s complement, with bit 7representing the SIGN bit. One LSB represents thesmallest capacitor to be switched in or out of thecapacitance array at the crystal pins. The aging offsetregister capacitance value is added or subtracted fromthe capacitance value that the device calculates foreach temperature compensation. The offset register isadded to the capacitance array during a normal tem-perature conversion, if the temperature changes fromthe previous conversion, or during a manual user con-version (setting the CONV bit). To see the effects of theaging register on the 32kHz output frequency immedi-ately, a manual conversion should be performed aftereach aging offset register change.\nPositive aging values add capacitance to the array,\nslowing the oscillator frequency. Negative valuesremove capacitance from the array, increasing theoscillator frequency.\nThe change in ppm per LSB is different at different tem-\nperatures. The frequency vs. temperature curve is shift-ed by the values used in this register. At +25°C, oneLSB typically provides about 0.1ppm change in fre-quency. These bits are all set to logic 0 when power is\nfirst applied.\nUse of the aging register is not needed to achieve the\naccuracy as defined in the EC tables, but could beused to help compensate for aging at a given tempera-ture. See the \nTypical Operating Characteristics section\nfor a graph showing the effect of the register on accu-racy over temperature.\nTemperature Registers (11h–12h)\nTemperature is represented as a 10-bit code with a res-olution of 0.25°C and is accessible at location 11h and12h. The temperature is encoded in two’s complementformat, with bit 7 in the MSB representing the SIGN bit.The upper 8 bits, the integer portion, are at location 11hand the lower 2 bits, the fractional portion, are in theupper nibble at location 12h. Example: 00011001 01b =+25.25°C. Upon power reset, the registers are set to adefault temperature of 0°C and the controller starts atemperature conversion.\nThe temperature is read on initial application of V\nCC\nand once every 64 seconds afterwards. The tempera-\nture registers are updated after each user-initiated con-version and on every 64-second conversion. Thetemperature registers are read-only.BIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: SIGN DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA\nPOR*: 00000000Aging Offset (10h/90h)\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: SIGN DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA\nPOR*: 00000000Temperature Register (MSB) (11h)\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: DATA DATA 0 0 0 0 0 0\nPOR*: 00000000Temperature Register (LSB) (12h)\n*POR is defined as the first application of power to the device, either V BATor VCC.\nDS3234 Extremely Accurate SPI Bus RTC\nwith Integrated Crystal and SRAM \nMaxim Integrated  |  17 www.maximintegrated.comTemperature Control Register\n(13h/93h)\nBit 0: Battery-Backed Temperature Conversion\nDisable (BB_TD). The battery-backed tempconv dis-\nable bit prevents automatic temperature conversionswhen the device is powered by the V\nBATsupply. This\nreduces the battery current at the expense of frequen-cy accuracy.\nSRAM Address Register (18h/98h)\nThe SRAM address register provides the 8-bit addressof the 256-byte memory array. The desired memoryaddress should be written to this register before thedata register is accessed. The contents of this registerare incremented automatically if the data register isaccessed more than once during a single transfer.When the contents of the address register reach 0FFh,the next access causes the register to roll over to 00h.\nSRAM Data Register (19h/99h)\nThe SRAM data register provides the data to be writtento or the data read from the 256-byte memory array.During a read cycle, the data in this register is thatfound in the memory location in the SRAM address reg-ister (18h/98h). During a write cycle, the data in this reg-ister is placed in the memory location in the SRAMaddress register (18h/98h). When the SRAM data regis-ter is read or written, the internal register pointerremains at 19h/99h and the SRAM address registerincrements after each byte that is read or written, allow-ing multibyte transfers.SPI Serial Data Bus\nThe DS3234 provides a 4-wire SPI serial data bus to com-municate in systems with an SPI host controller. TheDS3234 supports both single byte and multiple byte datatransfers for maximum flexibility. The DIN and DOUT pinsare the serial data input and output pins, respectively.The CSinput is used to initiate and terminate a data\ntransfer. The SCLK pin is used to synchronize data move-ment between the master (microcontroller) and the slavedevices (see Table 3). The shift clock (SCLK), which isgenerated by the microcontroller, is active only duringaddress and data transfer to any device on the SPI bus.Input data (DIN) is latched on the internal strobe edgeand output data (DOUT) is shifted out on the shift edge(Figure 2). There is one clock for each bit transferred.Address and data bits are transferred in groups of eight.BIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 BB_TD\nPOR*: 0 0000000Temperature Control (13h/93h)\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: A7 A6 A5 A4 A2 A1 A1 A0SRAM Address (18h/98h)\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: D7 D6 D5 D4 D2 D1 D1 D0SRAM Data (19h/99h)\nCS\nSCLK WHEN CPOL = 0\nSCLK WHEN CPOL = 1DATA LATCH (WRITE/INTERNAL STROBE) \nSHIFT DATA OUT (READ)\nDATA LATCH (WRITE/INTERNAL STROBE) \nSHIFT DATA OUT (READ)\nNOTE 1:  CPHA BIT POLARITY (IF APPLICABLE) MAY NEED TO BE SET ACCORDINGLY .\nNOTE 2:  CPOL IS A BIT SET IN THE MICROCONTROLLER\'S CONTROL REGISTER.\nNOTE 3:  DOUT REMAINS AT HIGH IMPEDANCE UNTIL 8 BITS OF DATA ARE READY TO BE  \n                SHIFTED OUT DURING A READ.\nFigure 2.

Any transfer requires the address of the byteto specify a write or read, followed by one or morebytes of data. Data is transferred out of the DOUT pinfor a read operation and into the DIN for a write opera-tion (Figures 3 and 4).The address byte is always the first byte entered after\nCSis driven low. The most significant bit of this byte\ndetermines if a read or write takes place. If the MSB is0, one or more read cycles occur.

After CSis driven low, an address\nis written to the DS3234. After the address, one or moredata bytes can be written or read. For a single-bytetransfer, one byte is read or written and then CSis dri-\nven high. For a multiple-byte transfer, however, multiplebytes can be read or written after the address has beenwritten (Figure 5). Each read or write cycle causes theRTC register address to automatically increment, whichcontinues until the device is disabled. The addresswraps to 00h after incrementing to 13h (during a read)and wraps to 80h after incrementing to 93h (during awrite). An updated copy of the time is loaded into theuser buffers upon the falling edge of CSand each time\nthe address pointer increments from 13h to 00h.Because the internal and user copies of the time areonly synchronized on these two events, an alarm condi-tion can occur internally and activate the INT/SQW pin\nindependently of the user data.If the SRAM is accessed by reading (address 19h) or\nwriting (address 99h) the SRAM data register, the con-tents of the SRAM address register are automaticallyincremented after the first access, and all data cycleswill use the SRAM data register.\nHandling, PC Board Layout,\nand Assembly\nThe DS3234 package contains a quartz tuning-fork\ncrystal. Pick-and-place equipment can be used, butprecautions should be taken to ensure that excessiveshock and vibration are avoided. Exposure to reflow islimited to 2 times maximum. Ultrasonic cleaning shouldbe avoided to prevent damage to the crystal.\nAvoid running signal traces under the package, unless\na ground plane is placed between the package and thesignal line.
