The ACS712 outputs an analog signal, VOUT  . \nthat varies linearly with the uni- or bi-directional AC or DC \nprimary sampled current, IP , within the range specified. CF \nis recommended for noise management, with values that \ndepend on the application.ACS712\nDESCRIPTION\nThe Allegro™ ACS712 provides economical and precise \nsolutions for AC or DC current sensing in industrial,  commercial, \nand communications systems. The device package allows for \neasy implementation by the customer. Typical applications \ninclude motor control, load detection and management, switch-\nmode power supplies, and overcurrent fault protection. The \ndevice is not intended for automotive applications.\nThe device consists of a precise, low-offset, linear Hall circuit \nwith a copper conduction path located near the surface of the \ndie. Applied current flowing through this copper conduction \npath generates a magnetic field which the Hall IC converts into a \nproportional voltage. Device accuracy is optimized through the \nclose proximity of the magnetic signal to the Hall transducer. \nA precise, proportional voltage is provided by the low-offset, \nchopper-stabilized BiCMOS Hall IC, which is programmed \nfor accuracy after packaging.\nThe output of the device has a positive slope (>VIOUT(Q) ) \nwhen an increasing current flows through the primary copper \nconduction path (from pins 1 and 2, to pins 3 and 4), which is \nthe path used for current sampling. The internal resistance of \nthis conductive path is 1.2 mΩ typical, providing low power \nloss. The thickness of the copper conductor allows survival of \nACS712-DS, Rev. 21\nMCO-0000197FEATURES AND BENEFITS\n▪ Low-noise analog signal path\n▪ Device bandwidth is set via the new FILTER pin\n▪ 5 µs output rise time in response to step input current\n▪ 80 kHz bandwidth\n▪ Total output error 1.5% at TA = 25°C\n▪ Small footprint, low-profile SOIC-8 package\n▪ 1.2 mΩ internal conductor resistance\n▪ 2.1 kVRMS minimum isolation voltage from pins 1-4 to pins 5-8\n▪ 5.0 V , single supply operation\n▪ 66 to 185 mV/A output sensitivity\n▪ Output voltage proportional to AC or DC currents\n▪ Factory-trimmed for accuracy\n▪ Extremely stable output offset voltage\n▪ Nearly zero magnetic hysteresis\n▪ Ratiometric output from supply voltageFully Integrated, Hall-Effect-Based Linear Current Sensor IC  \nwith 2.1 kVRMS Isolation and a Low-Resistance Current Conductor\nContinued on the next page…\nNot to scalePACKAGE : 8-Lead SOIC (suffix LC)\nTypical Application  \nTÜV America  \nCertificate Number:  \nU8V 15 05 54214 038  \nCB 13 06 54214 026\nFebruary 9, 2023\nFully Integrated, Hall-Effect-Based Linear Current Sensor IC \nwith 2.1 kVRMS Isolation and a Low-Resistance Current ConductorACS7122\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nCharacteristic Symbol Notes Rating Units\nSupply Voltage VCC 8 V\nReverse Supply Voltage VRCC –0.1 V\nOutput Voltage VIOUT 8 V\nReverse Output Voltage VRIOUT –0.1 V\nOutput Current Source IIOUT(Source)  3 mA\nOutput Current Sink IIOUT(Sink) 10 mA\nOvercurrent Transient Tolerance IP 1 pulse, 100 ms 100 A\nNominal Operating Ambient Temperature TA Range E –40 to 85 °C\nMaximum Junction Temperature TJ(max) 165 °C\nStorage Temperature Tstg –65 to 170 °CSELECTION GUIDE\nPart Number Packing*TA  \n(°C)Current Sensing \nRange, IP (A)Sensitivity, Sens \n(Typ) (mV/A)\nACS712ELCTR-05B-T Tape and reel, 3000 pieces/reel –40 to 85 ±5 185\nACS712ELCTR-20A-T Tape and reel, 3000 pieces/reel –40 to 85 ±20 100\nACS712ELCTR-30A-T Tape and reel, 3000 pieces/reel –40 to 85 ±30 66\n*Contact Allegro for additional packing options.the device at up to 5× overcurrent conditions.

The change in device output in response to a \n1 A change through the primary conductor. The sensitivity is the \nproduct of the magnetic circuit sensitivity (G / A) and the linear \nIC amplifier gain (mV/G).

The product of the linear IC amplifier gain \n(mV/G) and the noise floor for the Allegro Hall effect linear IC \n(≈1 G).  The noise floor is derived from the thermal and shot \nnoise observed in Hall elements.

The degree to which the voltage output from \nthe IC varies in direct proportion to the primary current through \nits full-scale amplitude. Nonlinearity in the output can be attrib -\nuted to the saturation of the flux concentrator approaching the \nfull-scale current. The following equation is used to derive the \nlinearity:  \nwhere VIOUT_full-scale amperes  = the output voltage (V) when the \nsampled current approximates full-scale ±IP .\nSymmetry (ESYM).  The degree to which the absolute voltage \noutput from the IC varies in proportion to either a positive or \nnegative full-scale primary current. The following formula is \nused to derive symmetry:\nQuiescent output voltage (VIOUT(Q) ). The output of the device \nwhen the primary current is zero.  For a unipolar supply voltage, \nit nominally remains at VCC ⁄ 2.  Thus, VCC = 5 V translates into \nVIOUT(Q)  = 2.5 V . Variation in VIOUT(Q) can be attributed to the \nresolution of the Allegro linear IC quiescent voltage trim and \nthermal drift.\nElectrical offset voltage (VOE). The deviation of the device out -\nput from its ideal quiescent value of VCC / 2 due to nonmagnetic \ncauses. To convert this voltage to amperes, divide by the device \nsensitivity, Sens. \nAccuracy (ETOT). The accuracy represents the maximum devia -\ntion of the actual output from its ideal value.  This is also known \nas the total output error.  The accuracy is illustrated graphically in \nthe output voltage versus current chart at right.Accuracy is divided into four areas:\n•\t0 A at 25°C.

Allegro has a Chopper Stabiliza -\ntion technique that nearly eliminates Hall IC output drift induced \nby temperature or package stress effects. This offset reduction \ntechnique is based on a signal modulation-demodulation process. \nModulation is used to separate the undesired DC offset signal \nfrom the magnetically induced signal in the frequency domain.  \nThen, using a low-pass filter, the modulated DC offset is sup -\npressed while the magnetically induced signal passes through the filter.  As a result of this chopper stabilization approach, the \noutput voltage from the Hall IC is desensitized to the effects \nof temperature and mechanical stress. This technique produces \ndevices that have an extremely stable Electrical Offset V oltage, \nare immune to thermal stress, and have precise recoverability \nafter temperature cycling.  \nThis technique is made possible through the use of a BiCMOS \nprocess that allows the use of low-offset and low-noise amplifiers \nin combination with high-density logic integration and sample \nand hold circuits.

Such a low-\npass filter improves the signal-to-noise ratio, and therefore the \nresolution, of the device output signal. However, the addition of \nan RC filter to the output of a sensor IC can result in undesirable \ndevice output attenuation — even for DC signals. \nSignal attenuation, ∆VATT , is a result of the resistive divider \neffect between the resistance of the external filter, RF (see \nApplication 6), and the input impedance and resistance of the \ncustomer interface circuit, RINTFC . The transfer function of this \nresistive divider is given by:\nEven if RF and RINTFC  are designed to match, the two individual \nresistance values will most likely drift by different amounts over temperature. Therefore, signal attenuation will vary as a function \nof temperature. Note that, in many cases, the input impedance, \nRINTFC  , of a typical analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be as \nlow as 10 kΩ.\nThe ACS712 contains an internal resistor, a FILTER pin connec -\ntion to the printed circuit board, and an internal buffer amplifier. \nWith this circuit architecture, users can implement a simple \nRC filter via the addition of a capacitor, CF (see Application 7) \nfrom the FILTER pin to ground. The buffer amplifier inside of \nthe ACS712 (located after the internal resistor and FILTER pin \nconnection) eliminates the attenuation caused by the resistive \ndivider effect described in the equation for ∆VATT. Therefore, the \nACS712 device is ideal for use in high-accuracy applications \nthat cannot afford the signal attenuation associated with the use \nof an external RC low-pass filter.=∆VATTRINTFC\nRF + RINTFCVIOUT \uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb.\nApplication 6.
