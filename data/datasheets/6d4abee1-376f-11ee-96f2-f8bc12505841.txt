Device Operation  \n4.1 Data Input  \nThe SDA pin is normally pulled high with an external device. Data on the SDA pin may change only during \nSCL low time periods (see to Figure 4 -1).

After a read sequence, the stop command \nwill place the P24C64C in a standby mode (see Figure 4 -2). \nFigure 4 -2 Start and Stop Definition  \nSCL\nSDA\nStart Stop\n \n4.4 Acknowledge (ACK)  \nAll addresses and data words are serially transmitted to and from the P24C64C in 8 -bit words.

This happens during the ninth clock cycle.  \n \nP24C64C  Datasheet Rev. 1.8 \nPuya Semiconductor                                      10/25 Figure 4 -3 Output Acknowled ge \n1 2 3 7 8SCL\nSDAACK9\nAcknowledge\n \n \n4.5 Standby Mode  \nThe P24C64C features a low -power standby mode which is enabled: (a) after a fresh power up, (b) after \nreceiving a STOP bit in read mode, and (c) after completing a self -time internal programming operation  \n \n4.6 Soft Reset  \nAfter an interruption in protocol, power loss or system reset, any two -wire part can be reset by following these \nsteps:  (a) Create a start condition , (b) Clock nine cycles , and (c) create another start bit followed by stop bit \ncondition, as shown below.

These bits \nmust compare to their corresponding hardwired input pins.  \nThe E2, E1, and E0 pins use an internal proprietary circuit that biases them to a logic lo w condition if the pins \nare floating.  \nThe eighth bit of the device address is the read/write operation select bit. A read operation is initiated if this \nbit is high and a write operation is initiated if this bit is low. Upon a compare of the device address , the Chip \nwill output a zero. If a compare is not made, the device will return to a standby state.  \n4.8 Data Security  \nP24C64C has a hardware data protection scheme that allows the user to write protect the whole memory \nwhen the WCB pin is at Vcc.  \n \nP24C64C  Datasheet Rev. 1.8 \nPuya Semiconductor                                      12/25 5. Instructions  \n5.1 Write Operations  \n5.1.1 Byte Write  \nA write operation requires two 8 -bit data word address  (A12 ~A0) following the device address word and \nacknowledgment. Upon receipt of this address, the P24C64C will again respond with a “0” and then clock in \nthe first 8 -bit data word. Following receipt of the 8 -bit data word, the P24C64C will output a “0” and the \naddressing device, such as a microcontroller, must terminate the write sequence with a stop condition. And \nthen the P24C64C enters an internally timed write cycle, all inputs are disabled during this write cycle and the \nP24C64C will not respond until the write  is complete (see Figure 5 -1). \n \nFigure 5 -1 Byte Write  \n1E\n2E\n1E\n0010 XS\nT\nA\nR\nTW\nR\nI\nT\nEFirst \nWord AddressDevice Address\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKA\nC\nKSecond \nWord AddressDataInS\nT\nO\nP\nA\nC\nKM\nS\nBL\nS\nBM\nS\nBL\nS\nBSDA LINEXXA\n12A\n11A\n10A\n9A\n8A\n7A\n6A\n5A\n3A\n2A\n1A\n4A\n0\n \nNotes: [1] x means don’t care.  \n \n5.1.2 Page Write  \nA page write is initiated the same as a byte write, but the master does not send a stop condition after the first \ndata word is clocked in. Instead, after the P24C64C acknowledges receipt of the first data word, the master \ncan transmit more data words. The P24C64C will respond with a “0” after each data word received. The \nmicrocontroller must terminate the page write sequence wi th a stop condition.  \n \nFigure 5 -2 Page Write  \n1E\n2E\n1E\n0010 XXS\nT\nA\nR\nTW\nR\nI\nT\nEFirst\n Word AddressDevice Address\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKA\nC\nKSecond \nWord Address DataIn(n)\nA\nC\nKM\nS\nBL\nS\nBM\nS\nBL\nS\nBDataIn(n+x)\nA\nC\nKM\nS\nBL\nS\nBS\nT\nO\nP\nA\nC\nKA\nC\nKSDA LINEX\n \nThe lower five bits of the data word address are internally incremented following the receipt of each data \nword. The higher data word address bits are not incremented, retaining the m emory page row location. \nWhen the word address, internally generated, reaches the page boundary, the following byte is placed at the \nbeginning of the same page. If more than 32 data words are transmitted to the P24C64C, the data word \naddress will roll  over, and previous data will be overwritten. The address roll -over during write is from the last \nbyte of the current page to the first byte of the same page.   \nP24C64C  Datasheet Rev. 1.8 \nPuya Semiconductor                                      13/25 5.1.3 Acknowledge Polling  \nOnce the internally timed write cycle has started and the P24C64C inputs ar e disabled, acknowledge polling \ncan be initiated. This involves sending a start condition followed by the device address word. The read/write \nbit is representative of the operation desired. Only if the internal write cycle has completed will the P24C64C \nrespond with a “0”, allowing the read or write sequence to continue.  \n \n5.1.4  Write Identification Page  \nThe Identification Page ( 32 bytes) is an additional page which can be written and (later)  permanently locked \nin Read -only mode. It is written by the Write Identification Page  instruction. This instruction uses the same \nprotocol and format as Page Write (into memory  array), except for the following differences:  \n● Device type identifier = 1011b  \n● Word Address bits A11~A10 which must be ‘00’.  \n● LSB address bits A 4~A0 define the byte address inside the Identification page.  If the Identification page is \nlocked, the data bytes transferred during the Write Identification  Page instruction are not acknow ledged \n(NoA CK). \n \n5.1.5  Lock Identification Page  \nThe Lock Identification Page instruction (Lock ID) permanently locks the Identification page  \nin Read -only mode. The Lock ID instruction is similar to Byte Write (into memory array) with  \nthe following specific conditions:  \n● Device type identifier = 1011b  \n● Address bit A10 must be ‘1’; all other address bits are don’t care  \n● The data byte must be equal to the binary value xxxx xx1x, where x is don’t care  \n \n5.2 Read Operations  \nRead operations are initiated the same way as write operations with the exception that the read/write select \nbit in the device address word is set to “1”. There are three read operations: Current Address Read; Random \nAddress Read and Sequential Read.  \n \n5.2.1 Cur rent Address Read  \nThe internal data word address counter maintains the last address accessed during the last read or write \noperation, incremented by one. This address stays valid between operations as long as the chip power is \nmaintained. The address roll -over during read is from the last byte of the last memory page to the first byte of \nthe first page.  \nOnce the device address with the read/write select bit set to “1” is clocked in and acknowledged by the \nP24C64C, the current address data word is serially clocked out. The microcontroller does not respond with an \ninput “0” but does generate a following stop condition (see Figure 5-3). \n \n  \nP24C64C  Datasheet Rev. 1.8 \nPuya Semiconductor                                      14/25 Figure 5 -3 Current Address Read  \nDataOutS\nT\nO\nP\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nB1E\n2E\n1E\n0010S\nT\nA\nR\nTR\nE\nA\nDDevice Address\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKN\nO\nA\nC\nKSDA LINE\n \n \n5.2.2 Random Read  \nA Random Read requires a “dummy” byte writ e sequence to load in the data word address. Once the device \naddress word and data word address are clocked in and acknowledged by the P24C64C, the microcontroller \nmust generate another start condition.

The  number of bytes to \nread in the ID page must not exceed the page boundary (e.g . when  reading the Identification Page from \nlocation 10d, the number of bytes should be less than  or equal to 22, as the ID page boundary is 32 bytes).  \n \n5.2.5 Read the Lock Status   \nThe locked/unlocked status of the Identification page can be checked by transmitting a  specific truncated \ncommand [Identification Page Write instruction + one data byte] to the  device.

The entire 128  bits value must be \nread from the starting address of the serial number block to guarantee  a unique number.  \nSince the address pointer of the device is shared between the regular EEPROM array and the serial number  \nblock, a dummy write sequence, as part of a Rand om Read or Sequential Read protocol, should be \nperformed  to ensure the address pointer is set to zero. A Current Address Read of the serial number block is \nsupported but  if the previous operation was to the EEPROM array, the address pointer will retain the  last \nlocation accessed,  incremented by one. Reading the serial number from a location other than the first \naddress of the block will not  result in a unique serial number.  \nAdditionally, the word address contains a ‘10’ sequence in bit A11 and A10 of the wo rd address, regardless \nof the intended address as depicted in Table 4-2. If a n word address other than ‘10’ is used, then the  device \nwill output undefined data.  \nExample: If the application desires to read the first byte of the serial number, the word addre ss input would  \nneed to be 0800h.  \nThe Serial Number Read operation is terminated when the microcontroller does not respond with a zero \n(ACK) and  instead issues a Stop condition (see Figure 5-7) \n \nFigure 5 -7 Serial Number  Read  \n10 11\n111E\n2E\n1E\n00 XXS\nT\nA\nR\nTW\nR\nI\nT\nE\nSDA LINEFirst \nWord Address Device Address\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKA\nC\nKSecond \nWord Address\nA\nC\nKM\nS\nBL\nS\nB\nDummy Write\nDataOut(n)\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nB1E\n2E\n1E\n00S\nT\nA\nR\nTR\nE\nA\nD Device Address\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBR\n/\nWA\nC\nKDataOut(n+1)\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBA\nC\nKDataOut(n+x)\nM\nS\nBL\nS\nBS\nT\nO\nP\nA\nC\nKN\nO\nA\nC\nKXX XX XXX00000\n \nP24C64C  Datasheet Rev. 1.8 \nPuya Semiconductor                                      17/25 6.
