The L T1994’s output common mode voltage is independent of the input common mode voltage, and is adjustable by applying a voltage on the V\nOCM pin. A separate internal common mode feedback \npath provides accurate output phase balancing and reduced even-order harmonics. This makes the L T1994 ideal for level shifting ground referenced signals for driving dif-ferential input, single-supply ADCs.\nThe L T1994 output can swing rail-to-rail and is capable \nof sourcing and sinking up to 85mA. In addition to the low distortion characteristics, the L T1994 has a low input referred voltage noise of 3nV/√Hz. This part maintains its performance for supply voltages as low as 2.375V . It draws only 13.3mA of supply current and has a hardware shutdown feature that reduces current consumption to 225μA.\nThe L T1994 is available in an 8-pin MSOP or 8-pin DFN \npackage.\nn Differential Input A/D Converter Driver\nn Single-Ended to Differential Conversion\nn Differential Ampliﬁ  cation with Common Mode \nT ranslation \nn Rail-to-Rail Differential Line Driver/Receiver\nn Low Voltage, Low Noise, Differential Signal \nProcessingn Fully Differential Input and Output\nn Wide Supply Range: 2.375V to 12.6V\nn Rail-to-Rail Output Swing\nn Low Noise: 3nV/√Hz\nn Low Distortion, 2V P-P, 1MHz: –94dBc\nn Adjustable Output Common Mode Voltage\nn Unity-Gain Stable\nn Gain-Bandwidth: 70MHz\nn Slew Rate: 65V/μs\nn Large Output Current: 85mA\nn DC Voltage Offset <2mV Max\nn Open-Loop Gain: 100V/mV\nn Low Power Shutdown \nn 8-Pin MSOP or 3mm × 3mm DFN Package\nA/D Preampliﬁ  er: Single-Ended Input to Differential Output \nwith Common Mode Level ShiftingL T1994 Driving an L TC1403A-1 1MHz \nSine Wave, 8192 Point FFT Plot TYPICAL APPLICATION DESCRIPTION\nL, L T , L TC and L TM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation. \nAll other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

For best performance, \nit is highly recommended that stray capacitance be kept to an absolute minimum by keeping printed circuit connections as short as possible, and if necessary, strip-ping back nearby surrounding ground plane away from these pins.\nV\nOCM (Pin 2):  Output Common Mode Reference Voltage. \nThe V OCM pin is the midpoint of an internal resistive volt-\nage divider between the supplies, developing a (default) mid-supply voltage potential to maximize output signal swing. V\nOCM has a Thevenin equivalent resistance of \napproximately 40k and can be overdriven by an external voltage reference. The voltage on V\nOCM sets the output \ncommon mode voltage level (which is deﬁ  ned as the av-\nerage of the voltages on the OUT+ and OUT– pins). V OCM \nshould be bypassed with a high quality ceramic bypass capacitor of at least 0.1μF (unless connected directly to a low impedance, low noise ground plane) to minimize common mode noise from being converted to differen-tial noise by impedance mismatches both externally and internally to the IC.V\n+, V– (Pins 3, 6):  Power Supply Pins. For single-supply \napplications (Pin 6 grounded) it is recommended that  high quality 1μF and 0.1μF ceramic bypass capacitors be placed from the positive supply pin (Pin 3) to the negative supply pin (Pin 6) with minimal routing. Pin 6 should be directly tied to a low impedance ground plane. For dual power supplies, it is recommended that high quality, 0.1μF ceramic capacitors are used to bypass Pin 3 to ground and Pin 6 to ground. It is also highly recommended that high quality 1μF and 0.1μF ceramic bypass capacitors be placed across the power supply pins (Pins 3 and 6) with minimal routing.\nOUT\n+, OUT– (Pins 4, 5):  Output Pins. Each pin can drive \napproximately 100 Ω to ground with a short-circuit current \nlimit of up to ±85mA. Each ampliﬁ  er output is designed \nto drive a load capacitance of 25pF . This basically means the ampliﬁ  er can drive 25pF from each output to ground \nor 12.5pF differentially. Larger capacitive loads should be decoupled with at least 25 Ω resistors from each output.\nSHDN  (Pin 7):  When Pin 7 ( SHDN ) is ﬂ oating or when \nPin 7 is directly tied to V\n+, the L T1994 is in the normal \noperating mode. When Pin 7 is pulled a minimum of 2.1V below V\n+, the L T1994 enters into a low power shutdown \nstate. Refer to the SHDN  pin section under Applications \nInformation for a description of the L T1994 output imped-ance in the shutdown state.PIN FUNCTIONS\nLT1994\n101994fbFunctional Description\nThe L T1994 is a small outline, wideband, low noise and \nlow distortion fully-differential ampliﬁ  er with accurate \noutput-phase balancing. The L T1994 is optimized to drive low voltage, single-supply, differential input ana-log-to-digital converters (ADCs). The L T1994’s output is capable of swinging rail-to-rail on supplies as low as 2.5V , which makes the ampliﬁ  er ideal for converting ground \nreferenced, single-ended signals into V\nOCM referenced \ndifferential signals in preparation for driving low voltage, single-supply, differential input ADCs. Unlike traditional op amps which have a single output, the L T1994 has two outputs to process signals differentially. This allows for two times the signal swing in low voltage systems when compared to single-ended output ampliﬁ  ers. The balanced \ndifferential nature of the ampliﬁ  er also provides even-order \nharmonic distortion cancellation, and less susceptibility to common mode noise (like power supply noise). The L T1994 can be used as a single-ended input to differential output ampliﬁ  er , or as a differential input to differential \noutput ampliﬁ  er .\nThe L T1994’s output common mode voltage, deﬁ  ned as the \naverage of the two output voltages, is independent of the input common mode voltage, and is adjusted by applying a voltage on the V\nOCM pin. If the pin is left open, there is an \ninternal resistive voltage divider , which develops a potential halfway between the V\n+ and V– pins. The V OCM pin will have \nan equivalent Thevenin equivalent resistance of 40k, and a Thevenin equivalent voltage of half supply. Whenever this pin is not hard tied to a low impedance ground plane, it is recommended that a high quality ceramic capacitor is used to bypass the V\nOCM pin to a low impedance ground \nplane (see Layout Considerations in this document). The L T1994’s internal common mode feedback path forces accurate output phase balancing to reduce even order harmonics, and centers each individual output about the potential set by the V\nOCM pin.\n VVVV\nOUTCM OCMOUT OUT==++ –\n2The outputs (OUT+ and OUT–) of the L T1994 are capable \nof swinging rail-to-rail. They can source or sink up to approximately 85mA of current. Each output is rated to drive approximately 25pF to ground (12.5pF differentially). Higher load capacitances should be decoupled with at least 25Ω of series resistance from each output.\nInput Pin Protection\nThe L T1994’s input stage is protected against differential \ninput voltages that exceed 1V by two pairs of back-to-back diodes that protect against emitter base breakdown of the input transistors. In addition, the input pins have steering diodes to either power supply. If the input pair is overdriven, the current should be limited to under 10mA to prevent damage to the IC. The L T1994 also has steering diodes to either power supply on the V\nOCM, and  \nSHDN  pins (Pins 2 and 7) and if exposed to voltages that \nexceed either supply, they too should be current limited to under 10mA.\nSHDN  Pin\nIf the SHDN  pin (Pin 7) is pulled 2.1V below the positive \nsupply, an internal current is generated that is used to power down the L T1994. The pin will have the Thevenin equivalent impedance of approximately 55k Ω to V\n+. If \nthe pin is left unconnected, an internal pull-up resistor of 120k will keep the part in normal active operation. Care should be taken to control leakage currents at this pin to under 1μA to prevent leakage currents from inadvertently putting the L T1994 into shutdown. In shutdown, all biasing current sources are shut off, and the output pins OUT\n+ and \nOUT– will each appear as open collectors with a nonlinear \ncapacitor in parallel, and steering diodes to either supply. Because of the nonlinear capacitance, the outputs still have the ability to sink and source small amounts of transient current if exposed to signiﬁ  cant voltage transients. The \ninputs (IN\n+ and IN–) have anti-parallel diodes that can \nconduct if voltage transients at the input exceed 1V . The inputs also have steering diodes to either supply. The turn-on and turn-off time between the shutdown and active states are on the order of 1μs but depends on the circuit conﬁ  guration.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n111994fbLT1994\nGeneral Ampliﬁ  er Applications\nAs levels of integration have increased and, correspond-\ningly, system supply voltages decreased, there has been a need for ADCs to process signals differentially in order to maintain good signal-to-noise ratios. These ADCs are typically supplied from a single-supply voltage that can be as low as 2.5V and will have an optimal common mode input range near mid-supply. The L T1994 makes interfac-ing to these ADCs trivial, by providing both single-ended to differential conversion as well as common mode level shifting. Figure 1 shows a general single-supply application with perfectly matched feedback networks from OUT\n+ and \nOUT–. The gain to V OUTDIFF  from V INM and V INP is:\n VV VR\nRVV OUTDIFF OUT OUTF\nIINP INM =≈ ()+–\x81 ––\nNote from the above equation that the differential output \nvoltage (V OUT+ – V OUT–) is completely independent of \ninput and output common mode voltages, or the voltage at the common mode pin. This makes the L T1994 ideally suited pre-ampliﬁ  cation, level shifting, and conversion \nof single-ended signals to differential output signals in preparation for driving differential input ADCs.Effects of Resistor Pair Mismatch\nFigure 2 shows a circuit diagram that takes into consid-\neration that real world resistors will not perfectly match.

A low impedance ground plane should be used as a reference for both the input signal source and the V\nOCM pin. A direct \nshort of V OCM to this ground plane or bypassing the V OCM \nwith a high quality 0.1μF ceramic capacitor to this ground plane will further mitigate against common mode signals from being converted to differential.\nInput Impedance and Loading Effects\nThe input impedance looking into the V\nINP or V INM input \nof Figure 1 depends on whether or not the sources V INP \nand V INM are fully differential. For balanced input sources \n(VINP = –V INM), the input impedance seen at either input \nis simply:\n R INP = R INM = R IFor single-ended inputs, because of the signal imbalance \nat the input, the input impedance actually increases over the balanced differential case.

The \ninput common mode range depends on the circuit con-ﬁ  guration (gain), V\nOCM and V CM (refer to Figure 4).

The \noutput common mode range extends from approximately 1.1V above V\n– to approximately 0.8V below V+. The V OCM \npin sits in the middle of an 80k Ω to 80k Ω voltage divider \nthat sets the default mid-supply open-circuit potential.\nIn single-supply applications, where the L T1994 is used \nto interface to an ADC, the optimal common mode input range to the ADC is often determined by the ADC’s refer-ence. If the ADC makes a reference available for setting the input common mode voltage, it can be directly tied to the V\nOCM pin, but must be capable of driving a 40k \nequivalent resistance that is tied to a mid-supply potential. If an external reference drives the V\nOCM pin, it should still \nbe bypassed with a high quality 0.1μF capacitor to a low impedance ground plane to ﬁ  lter any thermal noise and to prevent common mode signals on this pin from being inadvertently converted to differential signals.\nNoise Considerations\nThe L T1994’s input referred voltage noise is on the order \nof 3nV/√ Hz. Its input referred current noise is on the \norder of 2.5pA/√ Hz. In addition to the noise generated \nby the ampliﬁ  er , the surrounding feedback resistors also \ncontribute noise.

When the feedback \nnetwork is comprised of resistors whose values are less than this, the L T1994’s output noise is voltage noise dominant (See Figure 6):\n \neeR\nRno niF\nI≈+⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟ \x811\nFeedback networks consisting of resistors with values \ngreater than about 10k will result in output noise which is ampliﬁ  er current noise dominant.\n \neI Rno n F≈2\x81 \x81Lower resistor values always result in lower noise at the \npenalty of increased distortion due to increased loading of the feedback network on the output. Higher resistor values will result in higher output noise, but improved distortion due to less loading on the output.\nFigure 6 shows the noise voltage that will appear differ-\nentially between the outputs. The common mode output noise voltage does not add to this differential noise. For optimum noise and distortion performance, use a dif-ferential output conﬁ  guration.\nPower Dissipation Considerations\nThe L T1994 is housed in either an 8-lead MSOP package \n(θ\nJA = 140°C/W or an 8-lead DD package ( θJA = 43°C/W). \nThe L T1994 combines high speed and large output current with a small die and small package so there is a need to be sure the die temperature does not exceed 150°C. In the 8-lead MSOP , L T1994 has its V\n– lead fused to the frame \nso it is possible to lower the package thermal impedance by connecting the V\n– pin to a large ground plane or metal \ntrace. Metal trace and plated through holes can be used to spread the heat generated by the device to the backside of the PC board. For example, an 8-lead MSOP on a 3/32" FR-4 board with 540mm\n2 of 2oz. copper on both sides \nof the PC board tied to the V– pin can drop the θJA from \n140°C/W to 110°C/W (see Table 1).\nThe underside of the DD package has exposed metal \n(4mm2) from the lead frame where the die is attached. \nThis provides for the direct transfer of heat from the die junction to the printed circuit board to help control the maximum operating junction temperature. The dual-in-line pin arrangement allows for extended metal beyond the ends of the package on the topside (component side) of a circuit board. Table 1 summarizes for the MSOP package, the thermal resistance from the die junction-to-ambient that can be obtained using various amounts of topside, and backside metal (2oz. copper). On multilayer boards, further reductions can be obtained using additional metal on inner PCB layers connected through vias beneath the package.\nFigure 6.

Compo-nents connected to the L T1994 should be connected with as short and direct connections as possible. A low noise, low impedance ground plane is critical for the highest performance. In single-supply applications, high quality surface mount 1μF and 0.1μF ceramic bypass capacitors with minimum PCB trace should be used directly across the power supplies V\n+ to V–. In split supply applications, \nhigh quality surface mount 1μF and 0.1μF ceramic bypass capacitors should be placed across the power supplies V\n+ to V–, and individual high quality surface mount 0.1μF \nbypass capacitors should be used from each supply to ground with direct (short) connections.\nAny stray parasitic capacitance to ground at the summing \njunctions, IN\n+ and IN– should be kept to an absolute mini-\nmum even if it means stripping back the ground plane away from any trace attached to this node. This becomes especially true when the feedback resistor network uses resistor values >500 Ω in circuits with R\nF = R I. Excessive \npeaking in the frequency response can be mitigated by adding small amounts of feedback capacitance around RF (2pF to 5pF). Always keep in mind the differential nature of the L T1994, and that it is critical that the output impedances seen by both outputs (stray or intended) should be as bal-anced and symmetric as possible. This will help preserve the natural balance of the L T1994, which minimizes the generation of even order harmonics, and preserves the rejection of common mode signals and noise.\nIt is highly recommended that the V\nOCM pin be either hard \ntied to a low impedance ground plane (in split supply applications) or bypassed to ground with a high quality APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT1994\n161994fb0.1μF ceramic capacitor in single-supply applications. \nThis will help prevent thermal noise from the internal 80kΩ-80kΩ voltage divider (25nV/√ Hz) and other exter-\nnal sources of noise from being converted to differential noise due to mismatches in the feedback networks. It is also recommended that the resistive feedback networks be comprised of 1% resistors (or better) to enhance the \noutput common mode rejection. This will also prevent V\nOCM input referred common mode noise of the common \nmode ampliﬁ  er path (which cannot be ﬁ  ltered) from being \nconverted to differential noise, degrading the differential noise performance.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSIMPLIFIED SCHEMATIC\n1994 SS01V+\nSHDN120k\nQ4I1\nQ3I1 55kV+\nV–\nOUT+V+\nV–V+\nV–\nVOCM\nV–V+\nV–V+V+V+\nV–BIAS\nADJUSTSHUTDOWN\nCIRCUIT\nCM\nADJUST80k\n80kQ11\nQ12\nQ5 Q6Q8\nI4BOUT+V+\nOUT–Q7I3BIAS\nR1\n4k\nR2\n4kCM2\n–+\nOUT–V+\nV–V+\nV–BIAS\nADJUSTQ9\nQ10CM1\nIN–V+\nV–\nIN+V+\nV––+\nV+\nQ1 Q2\nD2I2Gm2B Gm2A\nD1\nD4 D3\nI4A\n171994fbLT1994\nDifferential 1st Order Lowpass Filter\nMaximum –3dB frequency (f 3dB) 2MHz\nStopband attenuation: –6dB at 2 • f 3dB and 14dB at 5 • f 3dBExample: The speciﬁ  ed –3dB frequency is 1MHz Gain = 4\n1.

#### Description:
The LT1994 is a high precision, low noise, low distortion fully differential amplifier optimized for single-supply operation, particularly at 3V. It features a rail-to-rail output and is capable of driving differential input analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The output common mode voltage can be adjusted independently of the input common mode voltage, allowing for flexible signal processing.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Differential Input A/D Converter Driver**: The LT1994 is ideal for interfacing with low voltage, single-supply ADCs by converting ground-referenced signals into differential outputs.
- **Single-Ended to Differential Conversion**: It can convert single-ended signals to differential outputs, which is essential for maintaining signal integrity in noisy environments.
- **Differential Amplification with Common Mode Translation**: The device can amplify differential signals while adjusting the common mode level, making it suitable for various signal processing applications.
- **Rail-to-Rail Differential Line Driver/Receiver**: It can be used in applications requiring high output swing and low distortion, such as audio processing and instrumentation.

This component is particularly useful in applications where low noise and high precision are critical, such as in medical instrumentation, industrial sensors, and high-fidelity audio systems.
