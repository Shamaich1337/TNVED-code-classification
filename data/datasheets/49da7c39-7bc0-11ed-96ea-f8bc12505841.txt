The device is capable of supplying 200mA of output current with a dropout voltage of 340mV . Low quiescent current (30μA operating and 3μA shutdown) makes the L T1964 an excellent choice for battery-pow-ered applications. Quiescent current is well controlled in dropout.\nOther features of the L T1964 include low output noise. \nWith the addition of an external 0.01μF bypass capacitor , output noise is reduced to 30μV\nRMS over a 10Hz to 100kHz \nbandwidth. The L T1964 is capable of operating with small capacitors and is stable with output capacitors as low as 1μF . Small ceramic capacitors can be used without the necessary addition of ESR as is common with other regulators. Internal protection circuitry includes reverse output protection, current limiting, and thermal limiting. The device is available with a ﬁ  xed output voltage of –5V \nand as an adjustable device with a –1.22V reference volt-age. The L T1964 regulators are available in a low proﬁ  le \n(1mm) ThinSOT and the low proﬁ  le (0.75mm) 8-pin \n(3mm × 3mm) DFN packages.\nL, L T , L TC and L TM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime\nNote 2:  The L T1964 (adjustable version) is tested and speciﬁ  ed for these \nconditions with the ADJ pin connected to the OUT pin.\nNote 3:  Operating conditions are limited by maximum junction \ntemperature. The regulated output voltage speciﬁ  cation will not apply for all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. When operating at maximum input voltage, the output current range must be limited. When operating at maximum output current, the input voltage range must be limited.\nNote 4:  To satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, the L T1964 \n(adjustable version) is tested and speciﬁ  ed for these conditions with an external resistor divider (two 249k resistors) for an output voltage of –2.44V . The external resistor divider will add a 5μA DC load on the output.\nNote 5:  Dropout voltage is the minimum input to output voltage differential \nneeded to maintain regulation at a speciﬁ  ed output current. In dropout, the output voltage will be equal to: (V\nIN + VDROPOUT ).\nNote 6:  GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  and a current \nsource load. This means the device is tested while operating in its dropout region. This is the worst-case GND pin current. The GND pin current will decrease slightly at higher input voltages.Note 7:  ADJ pin bias current ﬂ  ows out of the ADJ pin.\nNote 8:  Positive SHDN  pin current ﬂ  ows into the SHDN  pin. SHDN  pin \ncurrent is included in the GND pin current speciﬁ  cation.\nNote 9:  For input-to-output differential voltages greater than 7V , a 50μA \nload is needed to maintain regulation.\nNote 10:  The L T1964 is tested and speciﬁ  ed under pulse load conditions \nsuch that T\nJ ≅ TA. The L T1964E is tested at T A = 25°C. Performance at \n–40°C to 125°C is assured by design, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The L T1964I is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range.\nNote 11:  A parasitic diode exists internally on the L T1964 between the \nOUT , ADJ and SHDN  pins and the IN pin. The OUT , ADJ and SHDN  pins \ncannot be pulled more than 0.5V more negative than the IN pin during fault conditions, and must remain at a voltage more positive than the IN pin during operation.\nNote 12:  For the L T1964-BYP , this speciﬁ  cation accounts for the operating \nthreshold of the SHDN  pin, which is tied to the IN pin internally. For the  \nL T1964-SD, the SHDN  threshold must be met to ensure device operation.\nNote 13:  Actual thermal resistance ( θ\nJA) junction to ambient will be a \nfunction of board layout.

The ADJ pin has a \nbias current of 30nA that ﬂ  ows out of the pin. The ADJ pin \nvoltage is –1.22V referenced to ground, and the output voltage range is –1.22V to –20V . A parasitic diode exists between the ADJ pin and the input of the L T1964. The ADJ pin cannot be pulled more negative than the input during normal operation, or more than 0.5V more negative than the input during a fault condition.\nBYP:  The BYP Pin is used to Bypass the Reference of \nthe L T1964 to Achieve Low Noise Performance from the Regulator . A small capacitor from the output to this pin will bypass the reference to lower the output voltage noise. A maximum value of 0.01μF can be used for reducing output voltage noise to a typical 30μV\nRMS over a 10Hz \nto 100kHz bandwidth. If not used, this pin must be left unconnected.\nExposed Pad (DFN Package Only):  IN. Connect to IN \n(Pins 7, 8) at the PCB.\nGND:  Ground.\nIN: Power is Supplied to the Device Through the Input Pin. \nA bypass capacitor is required on this pin if the device is more than six inches away from the main input ﬁ  lter \ncapacitor . In general, the output impedance of a battery rises with frequency, so it is advisable to include a bypass capacitor in battery-powered circuits. A bypass capacitor in the range of 1μF to 10μF is sufﬁ  cient.OUT : The Output Supplies Power to the Load. A minimum \noutput capacitor of 1μF is required to prevent oscillations. Larger output capacitors will be required for applications with large transient loads to limit peak voltage transients. A parasitic diode exists between the output and the input. The output cannot be pulled more negative than the input during normal operation, or more than 0.5V below the input during a fault condition. See the Applications Information section for more information on output capacitance and reverse output characteristics.\nSHDN : The SHDN  Pin is used to put the L T1964 into a Low \nPower Shutdown State. The SHDN  pin is referenced to \nthe GND pin for regulator control, allowing the L T1964 to be driven by either positive or negative logic. The output of the L T1964 will be off when the SHDN  pin is pulled \nwithin ±0.8V of GND. Pulling the SHDN  pin more than \n–1.9V or +1.6V  will turn the L T1964 on. The SHDN  pin \ncan be driven by 5V logic or open collector logic with a pull-up resistor . The pull-up resistor is required to supply the pull-up current of the open collector gate, normally several microamperes, and the SHDN  pin current, typi-\ncally 3μA out of the pin (for negative logic) or 6μA into the pin (for positive logic). If unused, the SHDN  pin must \nbe connected to V\nIN. The device will be shut down if the \nSHDN  pin is open circuit. For the L T1964-BYP , the SHDN  \npin is internally connected to V IN. A parasitic diode exists \nbetween the SHDN  pin and the input of the L T1964. The \nSHDN  pin cannot be pulled more negative than the input \nduring normal operation, or more than 0.5V below the input during a fault condition.\nLT1964\n111964fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 1. Adjustable OperationThe L T1964 is a 200mA negative low dropout regulator with \nmicropower quiescent current and shutdown. The device is capable of supplying 200mA at a dropout voltage of 340mV . Output voltage noise can be lowered to 30μV\nRMS \nover a 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth with the addition of a 0.01μF reference bypass capacitor . Additionally, the refer-ence bypass capacitor will improve transient response of the regulator , lowering the settling time for transient load conditions. The low operating quiescent current (30μA) drops to 3μA in shutdown. In addition to the low quies-cent current, the L T1964 incorporates several protection features which make it ideal for use in battery-powered systems. In dual supply applications where the regulator load is returned to a positive supply, the output can be pulled above ground by as much as 20V and still allow the device to start and operate.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe adjustable version of the L T1964 has an output volt-\nage range of –1.22V to –20V . The output voltage is set by the ratio of two external resistors as shown in Figure 1. The device servos the output to maintain the voltage at the ADJ pin at   –1.22V referenced to ground. The current \nin R1 is then equal to  –1.22V/R1 and the current in R2 is \nthe current in R1 plus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current, 30nA at 25°C, ﬂ  ows through R2 out of \nthe ADJ pin. The output voltage can be calculated using the formula in Figure 1. The value of R1 should be less \nthan 250k to minimize errors in the output voltage caused by the ADJ pin bias current. Note that in shutdown the output is turned off and the divider current will be zero. Curves of ADJ Pin Voltage vs Temperature and ADJ Pin Bias Current vs Temperature appear in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nThe adjustable device is tested and speciﬁ  ed with the ADJ \npin tied to the OUT pin and a 5μA DC load (unless otherwise speciﬁ  ed) for an output voltage of –1.22V . Speciﬁ  cations for output voltages greater than –1.22V will be propor-tional to the ratio of the desired output voltage to –1.22V; (V\nOUT/ –1.22V). For example, load regulation for an output \ncurrent change of 1mA to 200mA is 2mV typical at V OUT = \n–1.22V . At V OUT = –12V , load regulation is:\n (–12V/–1.22V) • (2mV) = 19.6mV\nBypass Capacitance and Low Noise Performance\nThe L T1964 may be used with the addition of a bypass \ncapacitor from V OUT to the BYP pin to lower output voltage \nnoise. A good quality low leakage capacitor is recom-mended. This capacitor will bypass the reference of the L T1964, providing a low frequency noise pole. The noise pole provided by this bypass capacitor will lower the out-put voltage noise to as low as 30μV\nRMS with the addition \nof a 0.01μF bypass capacitor . Using a bypass capacitor has the added beneﬁ  t of improving transient response. \nWith no bypass capacitor and a 10μF output capacitor , a –10mA to –200mA load step will settle to within 1% of its ﬁ nal value in less than 100μs. With the addition of a \n0.01μF bypass capacitor , the output will stay within 1% for the same –10mA to –200mA load step (see L T1964-5 T ransient Response in the Typical Characteristics section). However , regulator start-up time is proportional to the size of the bypass capacitor .\nHigher values of output voltage noise may be measured \nif care is not exercised with regard to circuit layout and testing. Crosstalk from nearby traces can induce unwanted noise onto the output of the L T1964-X.\n1964 F01GND\nADJ\nIN OUTL T1964VIN\nVOUT+R1\nR2\nVOUT = –1.22V(1 +      ) – (I ADJ)(R2)\nVADJ = –1.22V\nIADJ = 30nA AT 25°C\nOUTPUT RANGE = –1.22V TO –20VR2\nR1\nLT1964\n121964fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe L T1964 is designed to be stable with a wide range \nof output capacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects stability, most notably with small capacitors. A minimum output capacitor of 1μF with an ESR of 3Ω or less is recommended to prevent oscillations. The L T1964 is a micropower device and output transient response will be a function of output capacitance. Larger values of output capacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide improved transient response for larger load current changes. Bypass capacitors, used to decouple individual components powered by the L T1964, will increase the effective output capacitor value.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across temperature and applied voltage. The most common dielectrics used are speciﬁ  ed with EIA temperature char-\nacteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V , X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances in a small package, but they tend to have strong voltage and temperature coefﬁ  cients as shown in Figures 2 and 3. \nWhen used with a 5V regulator , a 16V 10μF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1μF to 2μF for the DC bias voltage applied and over the operating tempera-ture range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable characteristics and are more suitable for use as the output capacitor . The X7R type has better stability across temperature, while the X5R is less expensive and is avail-able in higher values. Care still must be exercised when using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R codes only specify operating temperature range and maximum capacitance change over temperature. Capacitance change due to DC bias with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than Y5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be signiﬁ  cant enough \nto drop capacitor values below appropriate levels. Capaci-tor DC bias characteristics tend to improve as component case size increases, but expected capacitance at operating voltage should be veriﬁ  ed.\nFigure 2.

Some ceramic capacitors have a piezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates voltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, similar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro-phone works. For a ceramic capacitor the stress can be induced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients. The resulting voltages produced can cause appreciable \nLT1964\n131964fb APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\namounts of noise, especially when a ceramic capacitor is \nused for noise bypassing. A ceramic capacitor produced Figure 4’s trace in response to light tapping from a pencil. Similar vibration induced behavior can masquerade as increased output voltage noise.For surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished by using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board and its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated through-holes can also be used to spread the heat gener-ated by power devices.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several \ndifferent board sizes and copper areas.

The power dissipated by the device will be made up of two components:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage \ndifferential: I\nOUT • (VIN – VOUT), and\n2. Ground pin current multiplied by the input voltage: \n IGND • VIN\nThe GND pin current can be found by examining the GND Pin Current curves in the Typical Performance Character-istics. Power dissipation will be equal to the sum of the two components listed above.\nThe L T1964 series regulators have internal thermal limiting \ndesigned to protect the device during overload conditions. For continuous normal conditions the maximum junction temperature rating of 125°C must not be exceeded. It is important to give careful consideration to all sources of thermal resistance from junction to ambient. Additional heat sources mounted nearby must also be considered.\nLT1964\n141964fb IOUT(MAX)  • (V IN(MAX)  – V OUT) + (I GND • VIN(MAX) )\nwhere, I\nOUT(MAX)  = –100mA\n V IN(MAX)  = –8V\n IGND at (I OUT = –100mA, V IN =  –8V) = –2mA\nso, P = –100mA • (–8V + 5V) + (–2mA • –8V) = 0.32WThe thermal resistance (junction to ambient) will be in the \nrange of 125°C/W to 150°C/W for the SOT-23 package depending on the copper area. So the junction temperature rise above ambient will be approximately equal to:\n 0.32W • 140°C/W = 44.2°CThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal to \nthe maximum junction temperature rise above ambient plus the maximum ambient temperature or:\n T\nJMAX = 50°C + 44.2°C = 94.2°C\nProtection Features\nThe L T1964 incorporates several protection features \nwhich make it ideal for use in battery-powered circuits. In addition to the normal protection features associated with monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and thermal limiting, the device is protected against reverse input voltages and reverse output voltages.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nare intended to protect the device against current overload conditions at the output of the device. For normal operation, the junction temperature should not exceed 125°C.\nThe output of the L T1964 can be pulled above ground \nwithout damaging the device. If the input is left open circuit or grounded, the output can be pulled above ground by 20V . For ﬁ  xed voltage versions, the output will act like a large resistor , typically 500k or higher , limiting current ﬂ  ow \nto less than 40μA. For adjustable versions, the output will  APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nact like an open circuit, no current will ﬂ  ow into the pin. \nIf the input is powered by a voltage source, the output will sink the short-circuit current of the device and will protect itself by thermal limiting. In this case, grounding the SHDN  pin will turn off the device and stop the output \nfrom sinking the short-circuit current.\nLike many IC power regulators, the L T1964 series have \nsafe operating area protection. The safe area protection activates at input-to-output differential voltages greater than –7V . The safe area protection decreases the current limit as the input-to-output differential voltage increases and keeps the power transistor inside a safe operating region for all values of forward input to-output voltage. The protection is designed to provide some output current at all values of input-to-output voltage up to the device breakdown. A 50μA load is required at input-to-output differential voltages greater than –7V .\nWhen power is ﬁ  rst turned on, as the input voltage rises, \nthe output follows the input, allowing the regulator to start up into very heavy loads. During start-up, as the input voltage is rising, the input-to-output voltage differential is small, allowing the regulator to supply large output currents. With a high input voltage, a problem can occur wherein removal of an output short will not allow the output voltage to fully recover . Other regulators, such as the L T1175, also exhibit this phenomenon, so it is not unique to the L T1964 series.\nThe problem occurs with a heavy output load when \nthe input voltage is high and the output voltage is low. Common situations are immediately after the removal of a short-circuit or when the SHDN  pin is pulled high after \nthe input voltage has already been turned on. The load line for such a load may intersect the output current curve at two points. If this happens, there are two stable operat-ing points for the regulator . With this double intersection, the input supply may need to be cycled down to zero and brought up again to make the output recover .\nLT1964\n151964fb\nInformation furnished by Linear Technology Corporation is believed to be accurate and reliable. \nHowever , no responsibility is assumed for its use.
