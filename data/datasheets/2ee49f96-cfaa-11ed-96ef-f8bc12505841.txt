I/O blocks provide support for cutting-edge \nmemory interface and network protocols through flex ible I/O standard and voltage support. The serial \ntransceivers in the UltraScale architecture-based devices transfer data up to 32.75Gb/s, enabling 25G+ backplane designs with dramatically  lower power per bit than previo us generation transceivers. All \ntransceivers, except the PS-GTR, support the required  data rates for PCIe Gen3, and Gen4 (rev 0.5), and \nintegrated blocks for PCIe enable UltraScale devices to support up to Gen4 x8 and Gen3 x16 Endpoint and \nRoot Port designs. Integrated blocks for 150Gb/s Interlaken and 100Gb/s Ethernet (100G MAC/PCS) \nextend the capabilities of UltraScale devices, enab ling simple, reliable suppo rt for Nx100G switch and \nbridge applications. Virtex UltraSca le+ HBM devices include Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators \n(CCIX) ports for coherently sharing data with different processors.\nClocks and Memory Interfaces\nUltraScale devices contain powerful clock management circuitry, including clock synthesis, buffering, and \nrouting components that together provide a highly capable framework to meet design requirements. The \nclock network allows for extremely flexible distribution of clocks to minimize the skew, power \nconsumption, and delay associated with clock sign als. The clock management technology is tightly \nintegrated with dedicated memory interface circuitry to enable support for high-performance external \nmemories, including DDR4. In addition to parallel me mory interfaces, UltraScale devices support serial \nmemories, such as hybrid memory cube (HMC).\nRouting, SSI, Logic, Storage, and Signal Processing\nConfigurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) containing 6-input l ook-up tables (LUTs) and flip-flops, DSP slices with \n27x18 multipliers, 36Kb block RAMs with built-in FIFO  and ECC support, and 4Kx72 UltraRAM blocks (in \nUltraScale+ devices) are all connected with an abun dance of high-performance, low-latency interconnect. \nIn addition to logical functions, the CLB provides shif t register, multiplexer, and carry logic functionality as \nwell as the ability to configure the LUTs as distribu ted memory to complement the highly capable and \nconfigurable block RAMs. The DSP slice, with its 96- bit-wide XOR functionality, 27-bit pre-adder, and \n30-bit A input, performs numerous independent functi ons including multiply accumulate, multiply add, \nand pattern detect. In addition to the device interc onnect, in devices using SSI technology, signals can \ncross between super-logic regions (SLRs) using dedica ted, low-latency interfac e tiles. These combined \nrouting resources enable easy support for next-gen eration bus data widths. Virtex UltraScale+ HBM \ndevices include up to 8GB of high bandwidth memory.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 4Configuration, Encryption, and System Monitoring\nThe configuration and encryption block performs numerous device-level functions critical to the \nsuccessful operation of the FPGA, MPSoC, or RFSoC.  This high-performance co nfiguration block enables \ndevice configuration from external  media through various protocols, including PCIe, often with no \nrequirement to use multi-function I/O pins during co nfiguration. The configuration block also provides \n256-bit AES-GCM decryption capability at the same  performance as unencrypted configuration. \nAdditional features incl ude SEU detection and correction, pa rtial reconfiguration support, and \nbattery-backed RAM or eFUSE technology for AES key storage to provide additional security. The System \nMonitor enables the monitoring of the physical envi ronment via on-chip temperature and supply sensors \nand can also monitor up to 17 external analog inputs. With Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs and RFSoCs, the \ndevice is booted via the Configuration and Security Un it (CSU), which supports secure boot via the 256-bit \nAES-GCM and SHA/384 blocks. The cryptographic engine s in the CSU can be used after boot for user \nencryption.\nMigrating Devices\nUltraScale and UltraScale+ families  provide footprint compatibility to  enable users to migrate designs \nfrom one device or family to anot her. Any two packages with the same footprint identifier code are \nfootprint compatible. For example, Kintex UltraS cale devices in the A1156 packages are footprint \ncompatible with Kintex UltraScale+ devices in the A1 156 packages. Likewise, Virtex UltraScale devices in \nthe B2104 packages are compatible with Virtex UltraS cale+ devices and Kintex UltraScale devices in the \nB2104 packages.

Columns of resources are combined in \ndifferent ratios to provide the optimum capability for th e device density, target market or application, and \ndevice cost. At the core of Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs and RFSoCs is the processing system that displaces \nsome of the full or partial columns of programmable logic resources. Figure 1  shows a device-level view \nwith resources grouped together. For simplicity, certain resources such as the processing system, integrated blocks for PCIe, configuration logic, and System Monitor are not shown. \nResources within the device are divided into segmented clock regions. The height of a clock region is \n60 CLBs. A bank of 52 I/Os, 24 DSP slices, 12 block RAMs, or 4 transceiver channels also matches the height \nof a clock region. The width of a clock region is essentia lly the same in all cases, regardless of device size \nor the mix of resources in the region, enabling repe atable timing results. Each segmented clock region \ncontains vertical and horizontal clock routing that span its full height and width.

Figure 2  is a representation of an FPGA \ndivided into regions.\nRF Data Converter Subsystem\nZynq UltraScale+ RFSoCs contain an RF data conver ter subsystem consisting of multiple RF-ADCs and \nRF-DACs.\nRF-ADCs\n12-bit RF-ADCs are arranged in tiles with each tile co nsisting of multiple RF-A DC instances. There are two \ntypes of RF-ADCs in Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoCs. With th e first type, used by most family members, an \nRF-ADC tile contains two 4GSPS converters. These conver ters can be configured in dividually for real input \nsignals or as a pair for I/Q input signals. With the second type, used by the ZU29DR device, an RF-ADC tile \ncontains four 2GSPS converters arranged in two pa irs. Each of these conver ters can be configured \nindividually for real input signals or as a pair fo r I/Q input signals. The RF-ADC tile has one PLL and a \nclocking instance. Decimation filters in the RF-ADCs can operate at 1X (therefore ac ting as a bypass filter), \n2X, 4X, or 8X at 80% of Nyquist bandwidth with 89d B stop-band attenuation. Each RF-ADC contains a \n48-bit numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) and a de dicated high-speed, high-performance, differential \ninput buffer with on-chip calibrated 100 Ω termination.\nRF-DACs\n14-bit RF-DACs are arranged in tiles of four RF-DACs per tile. Each RF-D AC runs at a data rate up to \n6.4GSPS. Each of these converters can be configured individually for real outputs or as a pair for I/Q \noutput signal generation. The RF-DAC tile has one PLL and a clocking instance. Interpolation filters in the \nRF-DACs can operate at 1X (therefore acting as a bypass filter), 2X, 4X, or 8X at 80% of Nyquist bandwidth \nwith 89dB stop-band attenuation.

Code parameter memory can \nbe shared across up to 128 codes. Codes can be select ed on a block-by-block basis with the encoder able \nto reuse suitable decoder codes. The SD-FEC uses  a normalized min-sum decoding algorithm with a \nnormalization factor programmable from 0.0625 to 1 in increments of 0.0625. There can be between 1 and \n63 iterations for each codeword. Early termination is specified for each co deword to be none, one, or both \nof the following:\n•Parity check passes\n•No change in hard information or parity bits since last operation\nSoft or hard outputs are specified for each codeword to include information and optional parity with 6-bit \nsoft log-likelihood ratio (LLR) on inputs and 8-bit LLR on outputs.\nTurbo Decoding\nIn Turbo mode, the SD-FEC can use the Max, Max Scale,  or Max Star algorithms. When using the Max Scale \nalgorithm, the scale factor is pr ogrammable from 0.0625 to 1 in increments of 0.0625. There can be \nbetween 1 and 63 iterations for each codeword, specif ied using the AXI4-Stream control interface. Early \ntermination is specified for each codeword to  be none, one, or both of the following:\n•CRC passes\n•No change in hard decisi on since last iteration\nSoft or hard outputs are specified for each codeword  to include systematic and optionally parity 0 and \nparity 1 with 8-bit soft LLR on inputs and outputs.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 23Processing System (PS)\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs and RFSoCs consist of a PS coupled with prog rammable logic. The contents of \nthe PS varies between the different Zynq UltraScale+ devices. All devices contain an APU, an RPU, and \nmany peripherals for connecting the multiple processi ng engines to external components. The EG and EV \ndevices contain a GPU and the EV devices contain a vi deo codec unit (VCU). The components of the PS are \nconnected together and to the PL through a multi-la yered ARM AMBA AXI non-blocking interconnect that \nsupports multiple simultaneous master-slave transa ctions. Traffic through the interconnect can be \nregulated by the quality of service (QoS) block in the interconnect. Twelve dedicated AXI 32-bit, 64-bit, or \n128-bit ports connect the PL to high-speed interconnect and DDR in the PS via a FIFO interface.\nThere are four  independently controllabl e power domains: the PL plus three within the PS (full power, \nlower power, and battery power doma ins). Additionally, many peripheral s support clock gating and power \ngating to further reduce dynamic and static power consumption.\nApplication Processing Unit (APU)\nThe APU has a feature-rich dual-core or quad-cor e ARM Cortex-A53 processor. Cortex-A53 cores are \n32-bit/64-bit application processors based on  ARM-v8A architecture, offering the best \nperformance-to-power ratio. The ARMv8 architecture  supports hardware virtua lization. Each of the \nCortex-A53 cores has: 32KB of instru ction and data L1 caches, with parity and ECC protection respectively; \na NEON SIMD engine; and a single an d double precision floating point un it. In addition to these blocks, \nthe APU consists of a snoop control unit and a 1MB L2  cache with ECC protection to enhance system-level \nperformance. The snoop control unit keeps the L1 caches  coherent thus eliminating the need of spending \nsoftware bandwidth for coherency. The APU also ha s a built-in interrupt controller supporting virtual \ninterrupts. The APU communicates to the rest of the PS  through 128-bit AXI cohere nt extension (ACE) port \nvia Cache Coherent Interconnect (CCI) block, usin g the System Memory Mana gement Unit (SMMU). The \nAPU is also connected to the Programmable Logic (P L), through the 128-bit ac celerator coherency port \n(ACP), providing a lo w latency coherent port for accelerators in the PL. To support real-time debug and \ntrace, each core also has an Embedded Trace Macrocell (ETM) that communicates with the ARM \nCoreSight™ Debug System.\nReal-Time Processing Unit (RPU)\nThe RPU in the PS contains a dual-core ARM Cortex-R 5 PS. Cortex-R5 cores are 32-bit real-time processor \ncores based on ARM-v7R architecture. Each of the Cort ex-R5 cores has 32KB of level-1 (L1) instruction and \ndata cache with ECC protection. In addition to the L1  caches, each of the Cortex-R5 cores also has a 128KB \ntightly coupled memory (TCM) interf ace for real-time single cycle access. The RPU also has a dedicated \ninterrupt controller. The RPU can operate in either split  or lock-step mode. In split mode, both processors \nrun independently of each other. In lock-step mode, they run in parallel with each other, with integrated \ncomparator logic, and the TCMs are used as 256KB unified memory. The RPU communicates with the rest \nof the PS via the 128-bit AXI-4 po rts connected to the low power doma in switch. It also communicates \ndirectly with the PL through 128-bit low latency AXI-4 ports. To support real-time debug and trace each \ncore also has an embedded trace macrocell (ETM ) that communicates with the ARM CoreSight Debug \nSystem. \nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 24External Memory\nThe PS can interface to many types of external memories through dedicated memory controllers. The \ndynamic memory controller supports DDR3, DDR3L, DDR4, LPDDR3, and LPDDR4 memories. The \nmulti-protocol DDR memory controller can be conf igured to access a 2GB address space in 32-bit \naddressing mode and up to 32GB in 64-bit addressing mode using a single or dual rank configuration of \n8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit DRAM memories. Both 32-b it and 64-bit bus access modes are protected by ECC \nusing extra bits.\nThe SD/eMMC controller supports 1 and 4 bit data interfaces at low, default, high-speed, and \nultra-high-speed (UHS) clock rates. Th is controller also supports 1-, 4-, or  8-bit-wide eMMC interfaces that \nare compliant to the eMMC 4.51 spec ification. eMMC is one of the pr imary boot and configuration modes \nfor Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs and RFSoCs and supports bo ot from managed NAND de vices. The controller \nhas a built-in DMA for enhanced performance.\nThe Quad-SPI controller is one of the primary boot and configuration devices. It supports 4-byte and \n3-byte addressing modes. In both addressing modes, single, dual-stacked, and dual-parallel \nconfigurations are supported. Sing le mode supports a quad serial NO R flash memory, while in double \nstacked and double parallel modes, it supp orts two quad serial NOR flash memories.\nThe NAND controller is based on ONFI3.1 specificatio n. It has an 8-pin interface and provides 200Mb/s of \nbandwidth in synchronous mode. It supports 24 bi ts of ECC thus enabling support for SLC NAND \nmemories. It has two chip-selects to support d eeper memory and a built-in DMA for enhanced \nperformance. \nGeneral Connectivity\nThere are many peripherals in the PS for connecting to external devices over industry standard protocols, \nincluding CAN2.0B, USB, Ethernet, I2C, and UART. Many  of the peripherals support clock gating and power \ngating modes to reduce dynami c and static power consumption.\nUSB 3.0/2.0\nThe pair of USB controllers can be configured as host, device, or On-T he-Go (OTG). The core is compliant \nto USB 3.0 specification and supports super, high, full,  and low speed modes in all configurations. In host \nmode, the USB controller is compliant with the Intel XHCI  specification. In device mode, it supports up to \n12 end points. While operating in USB 3.0 mode, the cont roller uses the serial transceiver and operates up \nto 5.0Gb/s. In USB 2.0 mode, the Universal Low Peripheral  Interface (ULPI) is used to connect the controller \nto an external PHY operating up to 480Mb/s. The ULPI is also connected in USB 3.0 mode to support high-speed operations.\nEthernet MAC\nThe four tri-speed ethernet MACs support 10Mb/s , 100Mb/s, and 1Gb/s operations. The MACs support \njumbo frames and time stamping through the interfac es based on IEEE Std 1588v2. The ethernet MACs can \nbe connected through the serial transceivers (SGMII), the MIO (RGMII), or through EMIO (GMII). The GMII interface can be converted to a different interface within the PL.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 25High-Speed Connectivity\nThe PS includes four PS-GTR transceivers (transmit an d receive), supporting data rates up to 6.0Gb/s and \ncan interface to the peripherals for communication over PCIe, SATA, USB 3.0, SGMII, and DisplayPort.\nPCIe\nThe integrated block for PCIe is co mpliant with PCI Express base specification 2.1 and supports x1, x2, and \nx4 configurations as root comple x or end point, compliant to tran saction ordering rules in both \nconfigurations. It has built-in DMA, supports one vi rtual channel and provides fully configurable base \naddress registers.\nSATA\nUsers can connect up to two external  devices using the two SATA host port interfaces compliant to the \nSATA 3.1 specification. The SATA interfaces can operate at 1.5Gb/s, 3.0Gb/s, or 6.0Gb/s data rates and are \ncompliant with advanced host controller interface (AHCI) version 1.3 supporting partial and slumber \npower modes.\nDisplayPort\nThe DisplayPort controller supports up to two lanes of source-only DisplayPor t compliant with VESA \nDisplayPort v1.2a specification (sourc e only) at 1.62Gb/s, 2.7Gb/s, and 5. 4Gb/s data rates. The controller \nsupports single stream transport (SST); video resolution  up to 4Kx2K at a 30Hz frame rate; video formats \nY-only, YCbCr444, YCbCr422, YCbCr420, RGB, YUV444, YUV422, xvYCC, and pixel color depth of 6, 8, 10, \nand 12 bits per color component. \nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU)\nThe dedicated ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU in the PS suppor ts 2D and 3D graphics acceleration up to 1080p \nresolution. The Mali-400 supports OpenGL ES 1.1 and 2.0 for 3D graphics and Open VG 1.1 standards for \n2D vector graphics. It has a geometry processor (GP)  and 2 pixel processors to perform tile rendering \noperations in parallel. It has de dicated Memory management units fo r GP and pixel processors, which \nsupports 4 KB page size. The GPU also has 64KB level- 2 (L2) read-only cache. It supports 4X and 16X Full \nscene Anti-Aliasing (FSAA). It is fully autonomous , enabling maximum parall elization between APU and \nGPU. It has built-in hardware texture decompression , allowing the texture to remain compressed (in ETC \nformat) in graphics hardware and decompress the requir ed samples on the fly. It also supports efficient \nalpha blending of multiple layers in  hardware without additional bandwidt h consumption. It has a pixel fill \nrate of 2Mpixel/sec/MHz and a triangle rate of 0. 1Mvertex/sec/MHz. The GPU supports extensive texture \nformat for RGBA 8888, 565, and 1556 in Mono 8, 16, and YUV formats. For power sensitive applications, \nthe GPU supports clock and power gating for each GP , pixel processors, and L2 cache. During power \ngating, GPU does not consume any static or dynamic po wer; during clock gating, it only consumes static \npower.\nVideo Codec Unit (VCU)\nThe video codec unit (VCU) provides multi-standard video encoding and decoding capabilities, including: \nHigh Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC),  i.e., H.265; and Advanced Video Coding (AVC),  i.e., H.264 standards.  \nThe VCU is capable of simultaneous encode and decode at rates up to 4Kx2K at 60 frames per second (fps) \n(approx. 600Mpixel/sec) or 8Kx4K at a reduced frame rate (~15fps).\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 26Input/Output\nAll UltraScale devices, whether FP GA, MPSoC, or RFSoCs, have I/O pins for communicating to external \ncomponents. In addition, in the PS, there are another 78 I/Os that the I/O peripherals use to communicate to external components, referred to as multiplexed I/O (MIO). If more than 78 pins are required by the I/O \nperipherals, the I/O pins in the PL can be used to  extend the MPSoC or RFSoC interfacing capability, \nreferred to as extended MIO (EMIO).\nThe number of I/O pins in UltraScale FPGAs and in  the programmable logic of Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs \nand RFSoCs varies depending on device and package. Ea ch I/O is configurable and can comply with a large \nnumber of I/O standards. The I/Os are classed as high -range (HR), high-performance (HP), or high-density \n(HD). The HR I/Os offer the widest range of voltage su pport, from 1.2V to 3.3V. The HP I/Os are optimized \nfor highest performance operation, from 1.0V to 1.8V. The HD I/Os are reduced-feature I/Os organized in \nbanks of 24, providing voltage support from 1.2V to 3.3V.\nAll I/O pins are organized in banks, with 52 HP or HR pins per bank or 24 HD pins per bank. Each bank has \none common V\nCCO output buffer power supply, which also po wers certain input buffers. In addition, HR \nbanks can be split into two half-banks, each with their own VCCO supply. Some single-ended input buffers \nrequire an internally generated or an externally applied reference voltage (VREF). VREF pins can be driven \ndirectly from the PCB or internally generated using the internal VREF generator circuitry present in each \nbank.\nI/O Electrical Characteristics\nSingle-ended outputs use a conventional CMOS pu sh/pull output structure driving High towards VCCO or \nLow towards ground, and can be put into a high-Z state.  The system designer can specify the slew rate and \nthe output strength. The input is always active but is  usually ignored while the output is active. Each pin \ncan optionally have a weak pull-up or a weak pull-down resistor.\nMost signal pin pairs can be configured as differentia l input pairs or output pa irs. Differential input pin \npairs can optionally be terminated with a 100 Ω internal resistor. All UltraScale devices support differential \nstandards beyond LVDS, including RSDS, BLVDS, differential SSTL, and differential HSTL. Each of the I/Os \nsupports memory I/O standards, such as single-ended and differential HSTL as well as single-ended and \ndifferential SSTL. UltraScale+ famili es add support for MIPI with a dedicated D-PHY in the I/O bank.\n3-State Digitally Controlled Impedance and Low Power I/O Features\nThe 3-state Digitally Cont rolled Impedance (T_DCI) can control the output drive impedance (series \ntermination) or can provide parallel te rmination of an input signal to VCCO or split (Thevenin) termination \nto VCCO/2. This allows users to eliminate off-chip terminati on for signals using T_DCI. In addition to board \nspace savings, the termination automatically turns o ff when in output mode or when 3-stated, saving \nconsiderable power compared to off-chip termination . The I/Os also have low power modes for IBUF and \nIDELAY to provide further power savings, especia lly when used to implement memory interfaces.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 27I/O Logic\nInput and Output Delay\nAll inputs and outputs can be configured as either co mbinatorial or registered. Double data rate (DDR) is \nsupported by all inputs and outputs. Any input or output can be individually delayed by up to 1,250ps of \ndelay with a resolution of 5–15ps. Such delays ar e implemented as IDELAY and ODELAY. The number of \ndelay steps can be set by configuration and can also  be incremented or decremented while in use. The \nIDELAY and ODELAY can be cascaded together to do uble the amount of delay in a single direction.\nISERDES and OSERDES\nMany applications combine high-speed, bit-serial I/O wi th slower parallel operation inside the device. This \nrequires a serializer and deserializer (SerDes) inside the I/O logic. Each I/O pin possesses an IOSERDES \n(ISERDES and OSERDES) capable of performing serial-t o-parallel or parallel-to- serial conversions with \nprogrammable widths of 2, 4, or 8 bits. These I/O logic features enable high-performance interfaces, such \nas Gigabit Ethernet/1000BaseX/SGMII, to be moved from the transceivers to the SelectIO interface.\nHigh-Speed Serial Transceivers\nSerial data transmission between devices on the sa me PCB, over backplanes, and across even longer \ndistances is becoming increasingly important for sc aling to 100Gb/s and 400Gb/s line cards. Specialized \ndedicated on-chip circuitry and differential I/O capabl e of coping with the signal integrity issues are \nrequired at these high data rates.\nThree types of transceivers are used in the UltraScale architecture: GTH and GTY in FPGAs and in the PL in \nMPSoCs and RFSoCs, and PS-GTR in the PS of MPSoCs and RFSoCs. All transceivers are arranged in groups \nof four, known as a transceiver Quad. Each serial transceiver is a combined transmitter and receiver. \nTable 19  compares the available transceivers. \nTable  19: Transceiver Information\nKintex UltraScaleKintex \nUltraScale+Virtex UltraScaleVirtex\nUltraScale+Zynq UltraScale+\nMPSoCs and RFSoCs\nType GTH GTY GTH GTY GTH GTY GTY PS-GTR GTH GTY\nQty 16–64 0–32 20–60 0–60 20–60 0–60 40–128 4 0–44 0–28Max. \nData Rate16.3Gb/s 16.3Gb/s 16.3Gb/s 32.75Gb/s 16.3Gb/s 30.5Gb/s 32.75Gb/s 6.0Gb/s 16.3Gb/s 32.75Gb/s\nMin. \nData \nRate0.5Gb/s 0.5Gb/s 0.5Gb/s 0.5Gb/s 0.5Gb/s 0 .5Gb/s 0.5Gb/s 1.25Gb/s 0.5Gb/s 0.5Gb/s\nKey \nApps•Backplane\n•PCIe \nGen4\n•HMC•Backplane\n•PCIe \nGen4\n•HMC•Backplane\n•PCIe \nGen4\n•HMC•100G+Optics\n•Chip-to-Chip\n•25G+\nBackplane\n•HMC•Backplane\n•PCIe Gen4\n•HMC•100G+Optics\n•Chip-to-Chip\n•25G+\nBackplane\n•HMC•100G+Optics\n•Chip-to-Chip\n•25G+\nBackplane\n•HMC•PCIe \nGen2\n•USB\n•Ethernet•Backplane\n•PCIe \nGen4\n•HMC•100G+\nOptics\n•Chip-to-\nChip\n•25G+\nBackplane\n•HMC\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 28The following information in this sect ion pertains to the GTH and GTY only. \nThe serial transmitter and receiver are independent circ uits that use an advanced phase-locked loop (PLL) \narchitecture to multiply the reference frequency input by certain programmable numbers between 4 and \n25 to become the bit-serial data clock. Each transcei ver has a large number of user-definable features and \nparameters. All of these can be defined during devi ce configuration, and many can also be modified \nduring operation. \nTransmitter\nThe transmitter is fundamentally a parallel-to-serial co nverter with a conversion ratio of 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, \nor 80 for the GTH and 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, 80, 128, or 160 for the GTY. This allows the designer to trade off \ndatapath width against timing margin in high-perfo rmance designs. These transmitter outputs drive the \nPC board with a single-channel differential output si gnal. TXOUTCLK is the appropriately divided serial \ndata clock and can be used directly to register th e parallel data coming from the internal logic. The \nincoming parallel data is fed th rough an optional FIFO and has ad ditional hardware  support for the \n8B/10B, 64B/66B, or 64B/67B encoding schemes to provide a sufficient number of transitions. The \nbit-serial output signal drives two package pins with  differential signals. This output signal pair has \nprogrammable signal swing as well as programmable pre- and post-emphasis to compensate for PC board \nlosses and other interconnect charac teristics. For shorter channels, the swing can be reduced to reduce \npower consumption.\nReceiver\nThe receiver is fundamentally a seri al-to-parallel converter, changing th e incoming bit-serial differential \nsignal into a parallel stream of words, each 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, or 80 bits in the GTH or 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, 80, \n128, or 160 for the GTY. This allows the designer to tr ade off internal datapath width against logic timing \nmargin. The receiver takes the incoming differentia l data stream, feeds it through programmable DC \nautomatic gain control, linear and decision feedback  equalizers (to compensate for PC board, cable, \noptical and other interconnect characteristics), and uses the reference clock input to initiate clock \nrecognition. There is no need for a separate clock line. The data pattern uses non-return-to-zero (NRZ) \nencoding and optionally ensures sufficient data tr ansitions by using the selected encoding scheme. \nParallel data is then transferred in to the device logic using the RXUSRCLK clock. For short channels, the \ntransceivers offer a special low-power mode (LPM) to  reduce power consumption by approximately 30%. \nThe receiver DC automatic gain cont rol and linear and decision feed back equalizers can optionally \n“auto-adapt” to automatically learn and compensate for different interconnect characteristics. This \nenables even more margin for 10G+ and 25G+ backplanes.\nOut-of-Band Signaling\nThe transceivers provide out-of-band (OOB) signaling,  often used to send low-speed signals from the \ntransmitter to the receiver while high-speed serial data  transmission is not active. This is typically done \nwhen the link is in a powered-down state or has not yet been initialized. This benefits PCIe and SATA/SAS \nand QPI applications.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 29Integrated Interface Blocks for PCI Express Designs\nThe UltraScale architecture  includes integrated blocks for PCIe tec hnology that can be configured as an \nEndpoint or Root Port. UltraScale devices are compliant to the PCI Express Base Specification Revision 3.0. UltraScale+ devices are compliant to the PCI Express Base Specification Revision 3.1 for Gen3 and lower \ndata rates, and compatible with the PCI Express Base Specification Revision 4.0 (rev 0.5) for Gen4 data \nrates.\nThe Root Port can be used to build the basis for a compatible Root Comp lex, to allow custom chip-to-chip \ncommunication via the PCI Express protocol, and to at tach ASSP Endpoint devices, such as Ethernet \nControllers or Fibre Channel HBAs , to the FPGA, MPSoC, or RFSoC.\nThis block is highly configurable to system design requirements and can operate up to the maximum lane \nwidths and data rates listed in Table 20 .\nFor high-performance applications, ad vanced buffering techniques of the block offer a flexible maximum \npayload size of up to 1,024 bytes. The integrated block interfaces to the integrated high-speed \ntransceivers for serial connectivity and to block RAMs for data buffering. Combined, these elements \nimplement the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, and Transaction Layer of the PCI Express protocol.\nXilinx provides a light-weight, configurable, easy-t o-use LogiCORE™ IP wrapper that ties the various \nbuilding blocks (the integrated block for PCIe, the tran sceivers, block RAM, and clocking resources) into an \nEndpoint or Root Port solution. The system designer has control over many configurable parameters: link \nwidth and speed, maximum payload size, FPGA, MPSoC, or RFSoC logic interface speeds, reference clock \nfrequency, and base address register decoding and filtering.Table  20: PCIe Maximum Configurations\nKintex \nUltraScaleKintex \nUltraScale+Virtex\nUltraScaleVirtex \nUltraScale+Zynq\nUltraScale+\nGen1 (2.5Gb/s) x8 x16 x8 x16 x16\nGen2 (5Gb/s) x8 x16 x8 x16 x16\nGen3 (8Gb/s) x8 x16 x8 x16 x16\nGen4 (16Gb/s)(1)x8 x8 x8\nNotes: \n1.

Using PCIe for the transport layer, CCIX can operate at \nseveral standard data rates (2.5, 5, 8, and 16Gb/s)  with an additional high-speed 25Gb/s option. The \nspecification employs a subset of full coherency prot ocols and ensures that FPGAs used as accelerators \ncan coherently share data with processors using different instruction set architectures.\nVirtex UltraScale+ HBM devices support CCIX data rate s up to 16Gb/s and contain four CCIX ports and at \nleast four integrated blocks for PCIe. Each CCIX port requires the use of one integrated block for PCIe. If \nnot used with a CCIX port, the integrated blocks for PCIe can still be used for PCIe communication.\nIntegrated Block for Interlaken\nSome UltraScale architecture-based  devices include integrated blocks for Interlaken. Interlaken is a \nscalable chip-to-chip interconnect protocol designed to enable transmission speeds from 10Gb/s to \n150Gb/s. The Interlaken integrated block in the UltraSca le architecture is compliant to revision 1.2 of the \nInterlaken specification with data striping and de-s triping across 1 to 12 lanes.  Permitted configurations \nare: 1 to 12 lanes at up to 12.5Gb/s and 1 to 6 lane s at up to 25.78125Gb/s, enabling flexible support for \nup to 150Gb/s per integrated block. With multiple In terlaken blocks, certain UltraScale devices enable \neasy, reliable Interlaken switches and bridges.\nIntegrated Block for 100G Ethernet\nCompliant to the IEEE Std 802.3ba, the 100G Ethernet integrated blocks in the UltraScale architecture \nprovide low latency 100Gb/s Ethernet ports with a wi de range of user customization and statistics \ngathering. With support for 10 x 10.3125Gb/s (CAUI)  and 4 x 25.78125Gb/s (CAUI-4) configurations, the \nintegrated block includes both the 100G MAC and PC S logic with support for IEEE Std 1588v2 1-step and \n2-step hardware timestamping. \nIn UltraScale+ devices, the 100G Ethernet blocks  contain a Reed Solomon Forward Error Correction \n(RS-FEC) block, compliant to IEEE Std 802.3bj, that can be used with the Ethernet block or stand alone in \nuser applications. These families also support OT N mapping mode in which the PCS can be operated \nwithout using the MAC.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 31Stacked Silicon Interconnect (SSI) Technology\nMany challenges associated with cr eating high-capacity devices are addr essed by Xilinx with the second \ngeneration of the pioneering 3D SSI technology. SSI  technology enables multiple super-logic regions \n(SLRs) to be combined on a passive interposer layer,  using proven manufacturing and assembly techniques \nfrom industry leaders, to create a single device with more than 20,000 low-power inter-SLR connections. \nDedicated interface tiles within the SLRs provide ultr a-high bandwidth, low late ncy connectivity to other \nSLRs. Table 21  shows the number of SLRs in devices that  use SSI technology and their dimensions.\nClock Management\nThe clock generation and distribution components in  UltraScale devices are located adjacent to the \ncolumns that contain the memory interface and input and output circuitry. This tight coupling of clocking \nand I/O provides low-latency clocking to the I/O for memory interfaces and other I/O protocols. Within \nevery clock management tile (CMT ) resides one mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM), two PLLs, clock \ndistribution buffers and routing, and dedicated circ uitry for implementing exte rnal memory interfaces.\nMixed-Mode Clock Manager\nThe mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) can serve as  a frequency synthesize r for a wide range of \nfrequencies and as a jitter filter for incoming clocks . At the center of the MMCM is a voltage-controlled \noscillator (VCO), which speeds up and slows down de pending on the input voltage it receives from the \nphase frequency detector (PFD).\nThere are three sets of programmable frequency dividers (D, M, and O) that are programmable by \nconfiguration and during normal operation via the Dyna mic Reconfiguration Port (DRP). The pre-divider D \nreduces the input frequency and feeds one input of the phase/frequency comparator. The feedback divider M acts as a multiplier because it divides th e VCO output frequency before feeding the other input \nof the phase comparator. D and M must be chosen appropriately to keep the VCO within its specified \nfrequency range. The VCO has eight equally-spaced outp ut phases (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and \n315°). Each phase can be selected to drive one of th e output dividers, and each  divider is programmable \nby configuration to divide by any integer from 1 to 128.\nThe MMCM has three input-jitter filter options: low bandwidth, high bandwidth, or optimized mode. \nLow-Bandwidth mode has the best jit ter attenuation. High-Bandwidth mode has the best phase offset. \nOptimized mode allows the tools to find the best setting.Table  21: UltraScale and UltraScale+ 3D  IC SLR Count and Dimensions\nKintex \nUltraScaleVirtex \nUltraScaleVirtex \nUltraScale+\nDevice KU085 KU115 VU125 VU160 VU190 VU440 VU5P VU7P VU9P VU11P VU13P VU31P VU33P VU35P VU37P\n# SLRs 222333223341123\nSLR Width \n(in regions)666669666888888\nSLR Height \n(in regions)555555555444444\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 32The MMCM can have a fractional counter in either the feedback path (acting as a multiplier) or in one \noutput path. Fractional counters allow non-integer in crements of 1/8 and can thus increase frequency \nsynthesis capabilities by a factor of 8. The MMCM ca n also provide fixed or dynamic phase shift in small \nincrements that depend on the VCO frequency. At 1,600MHz, the phase-shift timing increment is 11.2ps.\nPLL\nWith fewer features than the MMCM, the two PLLs in  a clock management tile are primarily present to \nprovide the necessary clocks to the dedicated memory interface circuitry. The circuit at the center of the PLLs is similar to the MMCM, with PFD feeding a VC O and programmable M, D, and O counters. There are \ntwo divided outputs to the device fabric per PLL as we ll as one clock plus one enable signal to the memory \ninterface circuitry.\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs and RFSoCs are equipped with five additional PLLs in the PS for independently \nconfiguring the four primary clock domains with the PS : the APU, the RPU, the DDR controller, and the I/O \nperipherals.\nClock Distribution\nClocks are distributed throughout UltraScale device s via buffers that drive a number of vertical and \nhorizontal tracks. There are 24 horizo ntal clock routes per clock region and 24 vertical clock routes per \nclock region with 24 additional vertical clock routes  adjacent to the MMCM and PLL. Within a clock region, \nclock signals are routed to the device logic (CLBs, etc.) via 16 gateable leaf clocks.\nSeveral types of clock buffers are av ailable. The BUFGCE and BUFCE_LEAF buffers provide clock gating at \nthe global and leaf levels, respectively. BUFGCTRL pr ovides glitchless clock muxi ng and gating capability. \nBUFGCE_DIV has clock gating capability and can divide a clock by 1 to 8. BUFG_GT performs clock division \nfrom 1 to 8 for the transceiver clocks. In MPSoCs and RFSoCs, clocks can be transferred from the PS to the \nPL using dedicated buffers.\nMemory Interfaces\nMemory interface data rates continue  to increase, driving the need for dedicated circuitry that enables \nhigh performance, reliable interf acing to current and next-generat ion memory technologies. Every \nUltraScale device includes dedicated physical inte rfaces (PHY) blocks located between the CMT and I/O \ncolumns that support implementation of high-perform ance PHY blocks to external memories such as \nDDR4, DDR3, QDRII+, and RLDRAM3. The PHY blocks in each I/O bank generate the address/control and \ndata bus signaling protocols as well as the prec ision clock/data alignmen t required to reliably \ncommunicate with a variety of high-performance memo ry standards. Multiple I/ O banks can be used to \ncreate wider memory interfaces. \nAs well as external parallel memory interfaces, Ultr aScale architecture-based devices can communicate to \nexternal serial memories, such as Hybrid Memory Cube  (HMC), via the high-speed serial transceivers. All \ntransceivers in the UltraScale architecture support the HMC protocol, up to 15Gb/s line rates. UltraScale \ndevices support the highest bandwidth HMC conf iguration of 64 lanes with a single FPGA.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 33Block RAM\nEvery UltraScale architecture-bas ed device contains a number of 36 Kb block RAMs, each with two \ncompletely independent ports that share only the stor ed data. Each block RAM can be configured as one \n36Kb RAM or two independent 18Kb RAMs. Each memory a ccess, read or write, is controlled by the clock. \nConnections in every block RAM column enable signals to be cascad ed between vertically adjacent block \nRAMs, providing an easy method to  create large, fast memory arra ys, and FIFOs with greatly reduced \npower consumption.\nAll inputs, data, address, clock enables, and write enables are registered. The input address is always \nclocked (unless address latching is turned off), retain ing data until the next operat ion. An optional output \ndata pipeline register allows higher clock rates at the cost of an extr a cycle of latency. During a write \noperation, the data output can reflect either the previo usly stored data or the newly written data, or it can \nremain unchanged. Block RAM sites that remain unused  in the user design are automatically powered \ndown to reduce total power consumption. There is an  additional pin on every block RAM to control the \ndynamic power gating feature.\nProgrammable Data Width\nEach port can be configured  as 32K × 1; 16K × 2; 8K × 4; 4K × 9 (or 8); 2K × 18 (or 16); 1K × 36 (or 32); or \n512 × 72 (or 64). Whether configured as block RAM or FIFO, the two ports can have different aspect ratios without any constraints. Each block RAM can be di vided into two completely independent 18Kb block \nRAMs that can each be configured to any aspect ratio from 16K × 1 to 512 × 36. Everything described \npreviously for the full 36Kb block RA M also applies to each of the sma ller 18Kb block RAMs. Only in simple \ndual-port (SDP) mode can data widths of greater th an 18bits (18Kb RAM) or 36 bits (36Kb RAM) be \naccessed. In this mode, one port is dedicated to read operation, the other to write operation. In SDP mode, \none side (read or write) can be variable, while the other is fixed to 32/36 or 64/72. Both sides of the \ndual-port 36Kb RAM can be of variable width.\nError Detection and Correction\nEach 64-bit-wide block RAM can ge nerate, store, and utilize eight additional Hamming code bits and \nperform single-bit error correction and double-bit e rror detection (ECC) during the read process. The ECC \nlogic can also be used when wr iting to or reading from external 64- to 72-bit-wide memories.\nFIFO Controller\nEach block RAM can be configured as a 36Kb FIFO or an 18Kb FIFO. The buil t-in FIFO controller for \nsingle-clock (synchronous) or dual-c lock (asynchronous or multirate) operation increments the internal \naddresses and provides four handsh aking flags: full, empty, programm able full, and programmable empty. \nThe programmable flags allow the user to specify the FI FO counter values that make these flags go active. \nThe FIFO width and depth are programmable with suppor t for different read port and write port widths on \na single FIFO. A dedicated ca scade path allows for easy creation of deeper FIFOs.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 34UltraRAM\nUltraRAM is a high-density, dual-port, synchronous memory block available in UltraScale+ devices. Both \nof the ports share the same clock and can address all of  the 4K x 72 bits. Each port can independently read \nfrom or write to the memory array. UltraRAM supports  two types of write enable schemes. The first mode \nis consistent with the block RAM byte write enable mode. The second mode allows gating the data and \nparity byte writes separately. UltraRAM blocks can be connected together to create larger memory arrays. Dedicated routing in the UltraRAM column enables the entire column height to be connected together. If \nadditional density is required, all the UltraRAM colu mns in an SLR can be connected together with a few \nfabric resources to create single instances of RAM approximately 100Mb in size. This makes UltraRAM an \nideal solution for replacing external memories such as SRAM. Cascadable anywhere from 288Kb to 100Mb, \nUltraRAM provides the flexibility to fulf ill many different memory requirements.\nError Detection and Correction\nEach 64-bit-wide UltraRAM can generate, store an d utilize eight additional Hamming code bits and \nperform single-bit error correction and double-bit error detection (ECC) during the read process.\nHigh Bandwidth Memory (HBM)\nVirtex UltraScale+ HBM devices incorporate 4GB HBM stacks adjacent to the FPGA die. Using stacked \nsilicon interconnect technology, the FPGA communica tes to the HBM stacks through memory controllers \nthat connect to dedicated low-induct ance interconnect in the silicon in terposer. Each Virtex UltraScale+ \nHBM FPGA contains one or two HBM stacks, resulting in up to 8GB of HBM per FPGA.\nThe FPGA has 32 HBM AXI interfaces used to commu nicate with the HBM. Through a built-in switch \nmechanism, any of the 32 HBM AXI interfaces can access any memory address on either one or both of the \nHBM stacks due to the flexible addressing feature.  This flexible connection between the FPGA and the \nHBM stacks results in easy floorplanning and timing  closure. The memory controllers perform read and \nwrite reordering to improve bus efficiency. Data inte grity is ensured through e rror checking and correction \n(ECC) circuitry.\nConfigurable Logic Block\nEvery Configurable Logic Block (CLB) in the UltraScale  architecture contains 8 LUTs and 16 flip-flops. The \nLUTs can be configured as either one 6-input LUT with  one output, or as two 5-input LUTs with separate \noutputs but common inputs. Each LUT can optionally be registered in a flip-flop. In addition to the LUTs and flip-flops, the CLB contains arit hmetic carry logic and multiplexers to create wider logic functions. \nEach CLB contains one slice. There are two types of s lices: SLICEL and SLICEM. LUTs in the SLICEM can be \nconfigured as 64-bit RAM, as 32-bit  shift registers (SRL32), or as two SRL16s. CLBs in the UltraScale \narchitecture have increased routing and connectivit y compared to CLBs in previous-generation Xilinx \ndevices. They also have additional control signals to enable superior register pa cking, resulting in overall \nhigher device utilization.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 35Interconnect\nVarious length vertical and horizontal routing resources in  the UltraScale architecture that span 1, 2, 4, 5, \n12, or 16 CLBs ensure that all signals can be transported from source to destination with ease, providing support for the next generation of wide data buses to be routed across even the highest capacity devices \nwhile simultaneously improving qualit y of results and software run time.\nDigital Signal Processing\nDSP applications use many binary multipliers and accumulators, best implem ented in dedicated DSP \nslices. All UltraScale devices have many dedicated, low-power DSP slices, combin ing high speed with small \nsize while retaining system design flexibility.\nEach DSP slice fundamentally consists of a dedicated 27 × 18 bit twos complement multiplier and a 48-bit \naccumulator. The multiplier can be dynamically bypassed, and two 48-bit inputs can feed a \nsingle-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) arithmetic  unit (dual 24-bit add/subtract/accumulate or quad \n12-bit add/subtract/accumulate), or a logic unit that can generate any one of ten different logic functions \nof the two operands.\nThe DSP includes an additional pre-adder, typically us ed in symmetrical filters.  This pre-adder improves \nperformance in densely packed designs and reduces the DSP slice count by up to 50%. The 96-bit-wide \nXOR function, programmable to 12, 24, 48, or 96-bi t widths, enables performance improvements when \nimplementing forward error correction and cyclic redundancy checking algorithms.\nThe DSP also includes a 48-bit-wide pattern detector  that can be used for convergent or symmetric \nrounding. The pattern detector is also capable of im plementing 96-bit-wide logic functions when used in \nconjunction with the logic unit.\nThe DSP slice provides extensive pipelining and ex tension capabilities that enhance the speed and \nefficiency of many applications beyond digital sign al processing, such as wide dynamic bus shifters, \nmemory address generators, wide bus multiplexe rs, and memory-mapped I/O register files. The \naccumulator can also be used as a synchronous up/down counter.\nSystem Monitor\nThe System Monitor blocks in the UltraScale architectu re are used to enhance the overall safety, security, \nand reliability of the system by monitoring the physical environment via on-chip power supply and temperature sensors and external channels to the ADC.\nAll UltraScale architecture-based devices contain at  least one System Monitor. The System Monitor in \nUltraScale+ FPGAs and the PL of Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs  and RFSoCs is similar to the Kintex UltraScale \nand Virtex UltraScale devices but with addi tional features including a PMBus interface.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 36Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs contain an additional System Monitor block in the PS. See Table 22 .\nIn FPGAs and the PL of the MPSoCs and RFSoCs, se nsor outputs and up to 17 user-allocated external \nanalog inputs are digitized using a 10-bit 200 kilo-sample-per-second (kSPS) ADC, and the measurements \nare stored in registers that can be accessed via intern al FPGA (DRP), JTAG, PMBus, or I2C interfaces. The \nI2C interface and PMBus allow the on-chip monitoring to be easily accessed by the System Manager/Host \nbefore and after device configuration. \nThe System Monitor in the PS MPSoC and RFSoC uses  a 10-bit, 1 mega-sample-per-second (MSPS) ADC to \ndigitize the sensor outputs. The measurements are stored in registers and are accessed via the Advanced \nPeripheral Bus (APB) interface by the processors an d the platform management  unit (PMU) in the PS. \nConfiguration\nThe UltraScale architecture-based devices store thei r customized configuration in SRAM-type internal \nlatches. The configuration storage is volatile and mu st be reloaded whenever the device is powered up. \nThis storage can also be reloaded at any time. Seve ral methods and data formats  for loading configuration \nare available, determined by the mode pins, with mo re dedicated configuration datapath pins to simplify \nthe configuration process.\nUltraScale architecture-based devi ces support secure and non-secure boot with optional Advanced \nEncryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) decryption and authentication logic. If only \nauthentication is required, the UltraScale architecture provides an alternative form of authentication in the \nform of RSA algorithms. For RSA authentication suppor t in the Kintex UltraScale and Virtex UltraScale \nfamilies, go to UG570 , UltraScale Architecture Configuration User Guide .\nUltraScale architecture-based device s also have the ability to select be tween multiple configurations, and \nsupport robust field-update methodologies. This is es pecially useful for updates to a design after the end \nproduct has been shipped. Designers can release their product with an early version of the design, thus \ngetting their product to market faster. This feature a llows designers to keep their customers current with \nthe most up-to-date design while the product is already deployed in the field. \nBooting MPSoCs and RFSoCs\nZynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs and RFSoCs use a multi-stag e boot process that supports both a non-secure \nand a secure boot. The PS is the master of the boot  and configuration process. For a secure boot, the \nAES-GCM, SHA-3/384 decryption/authentication, and 4096-bit RSA blocks decrypt and authenticate the \nimage.Table  22: Key System Monitor Features\nKintex UltraScale\nVirtex UltraScaleKintex UltraScale+\nVirtex UltraScale+\nZynq UltraScale+ PL Zynq UltraScale+ PS\nADC 10-bit 200kSPS 10-bit 200kSPS 10-bit 1MSPS\nInterfaces JTAG, I2C, DRP JTAG, I2C, DRP, PMBus APB\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 37Upon reset, the device mode pins are read to determine the primary boot device to be used: NAND, \nQuad-SPI, SD, eMMC, or JTAG. JTAG ca n only be used as a non-secure boot source and is intended for \ndebugging purposes. One of the CPUs, Cortex-A53 or Cortex-R5, executes code out of on-chip ROM and \ncopies the first stage boot loader (FSBL) from  the boot device to the on-chip memory (OCM).\nAfter copying the FSBL to OCM, the processor execut es the FSBL. Xilinx supplies example FSBLs or users \ncan create their own. The FSBL initiates the boot of the PS and can load and configure the PL, or \nconfiguration of the PL can be deferred to a later stag e. The FSBL typically loads either a user application \nor an optional second stage boot loader (SSBL) such as U-Boot. Users obtain example SSBL from Xilinx or \na third party, or they can create their own SSBL. The SSBL continues the boot process by loading code from \nany of the primary boot devices or from other source s such as USB, Ethernet, etc. If the FSBL did not \nconfigure the PL, the SSBL can do so, or again, th e configuration can be deferred to a later stage.\nThe static memory interface controll er (NAND, eMMC, or Qu ad-SPI) is configured using default settings. \nTo improve device configuration speed, these settings can be modified by information provided in the boot image header. The ROM boot  image is not user readable  or executable after boot.\nConfiguring FPGAs\nThe SPI (serial NOR) interface (x1, x2, x4, and dual x4  modes) and the BPI (para llel NOR) interface (x8 and \nx16 modes) are two common methods used for configurin g the FPGA. Users can directly connect an SPI or \nBPI flash to the FPGA, and the FPGA\'s internal configuration logic reads the bitstream out of the flash and \nconfigures itself, eliminating the need for an extern al controller. The FPGA au tomatically detects the bus \nwidth on the fly, eliminatin g the need for any external controls or switches. Bus widths supported are x1, \nx2, x4, and dual x4 for SPI, and x8 and x16 for BPI. The larger bus widths increase configuration speed and \nreduce the amount of time it takes for the FPGA to start up after power-on.\nIn master mode, the FPGA can drive the configuration clock from an internally generated clock, or for \nhigher speed configuration, the FPGA can use an external configuration clock source. This allows \nhigh-speed configuration with the ease of use charac teristic of master mode. Slave modes up to 32 bits \nwide that are especially useful for processor-driven  configuration are also supported by the FPGA. In \naddition, the new media configuration access port (MCAP) provides a direct connection between the \nintegrated block for PCIe and the configuratio n logic to simplify configuration over PCIe.\nSEU detection and mitigation (SEM) IP, RSA authentica tion, post-configuration CRC, and Security Monitor \n(SecMon) IP are not supported in the KU025 FPGA.\nPackaging\nThe UltraScale devices are available in a variety of  organic flip-chip and lidless flip-chip packages \nsupporting different quantities of I/Os and transcei vers. Maximum supported pe rformance can depend on \nthe style of package and its materi al. Always refer to the specific device data sheet for performance \nspecifications by package type.\nIn flip-chip packages, the silicon device is attached  to the package substrate using a high-performance \nflip-chip process. Decoupling capacitors are mounted  on the package substrate to optimize signal \nintegrity under simultan eous switching of outputs (SSO) conditions.\nUltraScale Architecture and Product Data Sheet: Overview\nDS890 (v3.1) November 15, 2017 www.xilinx.com\nPreliminary Produc t Specification 38Ordering Information\nTable 23  shows the speed and temperature grades available in the different device families.
