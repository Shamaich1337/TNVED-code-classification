The MAX13253 has an internal oscillator \nand operates from a single +3.0V to +5.5V supply. The \ntransformer’s secondary-to-primary winding ratio defines \nthe output voltage, allowing selection of virtually any \nisolated output voltage with galvanic isolation.\nThe MAX13253 features an integrated oscillator driving \na pair of n-channel power switches. The driver includes \npin-selectable spread-spectrum oscillation and a well-\ncontrolled slew rate to reduce EMI. The MAX13253 can \noptionally be driven by an external clock to further manage \nEMI. Internal circuitry guarantees a fixed 50% duty cycle \nto prevent DC current flow through the transformer, \nregardless of which clock source is used.\nThe MAX13253 operates with up to 1A of continuous \ncurrent and features integrated protection including fault \ndetection, overcurrent protection, and thermal shutdown.\nThe MAX13253 includes a low-current shutdown mode to \nreduce the overall supply current to less than 5µA (max) \nwhen the driver is disabled.\nThe MAX13253 is available in a small 10-pin (3mm x \n3mm) TDFN package and is specified over the -40°C to \n+125°C temperature range.Features and Benefits\n ●Simple, Flexible Design\n• +3.0V to +5.5V Supply Range\n• Low RON 300mΩ (max) at 4.5V\n• Up to 90% Efficiency\n• Provides Up to 1A to the Transformer\n• Internal or External Clock Source \n• Internal Oscillator Frequency: 250kHz or 600kHz\n• Optional Spread-Spectrum Oscillation \n• -40ºC to +125ºC Temperature Range\n ●Integrated System Protection\n• Fault Detection and Indication\n• Overcurrent Limiting\n• Undervoltage Lockout\n• Thermal Shutdown\n ●Saves Space on Board \n• Small 10-Pin TDFN Package (3mm x 3mm)\nApplications\n ●Power Meter Data Interface\n ●Isolated Fieldbus Interface\n ●Medical Equipment\n ●Isolated Analog Front-End\n ●Isolated USB Power\n19-6600; Rev 2; 9/18Ordering Information  appears at end of data sheet.\nFAULT1µF\n1µF\n10µF5V\nVDD\nEN\nCLKSPRDHICLK\nT1\nGND PGNDT2\nISOLATED\nVOUT1CT:1.3CT\nMAX13253\nMAX13253 1A, Spread-Spectrum, Push-Pull, Transformer \nDriver for Isolated Power Supplies\n  Typical Operating CircuitEVALUATION KIT AVAILABLE\nClick here  for production status of specific part numbers.\n(All voltages referenced to GND.)\nVDD, FAULT , CLK, HICLK, SPRD, EN.................... -0.3V to +6V \nT1, T2  ................................................................. -0.3V to +16.5V\nT1, T2 Maximum Continuous Current  .............................. +1.75A\nFAULT  Maximum Continuous Current  ............................. +50mA\nContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70ºC)\n TDFN (Multilayer Board)  \n(derate 24.4mW/ºC above +70ºC)  .......................... 1951.2mW TDFN (Single-Layer Board)  \n(derate 18.5mW/ºC above +70ºC)  .......................... 1481.5mW\nOperating Temperature Range  .......................... -40ºC to +125ºC\nJunction Temperature  ...................................................... +150ºC\nStorage Temperature Range  ............................. -65ºC to +150°C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)  ................................. +300°C\nSoldering Temperature (reflow)  ....................................... +260°C\n(VDD = +3.0V to +5.5V, T A = TMIN to T MAX, unless otherwise noted.

An \non-board oscillator, protection circuitry, and internal \nMOSFETs provide up to 1A of drive current to the primary \nwindings of a center-tapped transformer. The MAX13253 \nfeatures an internal oscillator for autonomous operation \nand an external clock source input to synchronize multiple \nMAX13253 devices. Regardless of the clock source used, \nan internal flip-flop stage guarantees a fixed 50% duty \ncycle to prevent DC current flow in the transformer.\nThe MAX13253 operates from a single +3.0V to +5.5V \nsupply and includes undervoltage lockout for controlled \nstartup. Overcurrent protection and thermal shutdown \ncircuitry provides additional protection against excessive \npower dissipation.\nIsolated Power-Supply Application\nThe MAX13253 allows a versatile range of secondary-\nside rectification circuits (see Figure 3 ). The primary-to-secondary transformer winding ratio can be chosen to \nadjust the isolated output voltage. The MAX13253 allows \nup to 1A of current into the primary transformer winding \nwith a supply voltage up to +5.5V.\nClock Source\nEither the internal oscillator or an external clock provides \nthe switching signal for the MAX13253. Connect CLK to \nground to select the internal oscillator. Provide an external \nsignal to CLK to automatically select external clocking.\nInternal Oscillator Mode\nThe MAX13253 includes an internal oscillator with a \nguaranteed 50% duty cycle. Drive the HICLK input high to \nset the internal oscillator frequency to 600kHz (typ). Drive \nthe HICLK input low to set the internal oscillator frequency \nto 250kHz (typ).\nThe MAX13253 features spread-spectrum oscillation for \nreducing EMI peaks. Drive the SPRD input high to enable \nspread spectrum on the internal oscillator.

SPRD has an internal \n10µA pulldown to ground.\nExternal Clock Mode\nThe MAX13253 provides an external clock mode for \nsynchronizing multiple MAX13253 devices. Apply an \nexternal clock source to the CLK input to enable external \nclock mode. An internal flip-flop divides the external clock \nby two in order to generate a switching signal with a \nguaranteed 50% duty cycle. As a result, the MAX13253 \noutputs switch at one-half of the external clock frequency. \nT1 and T2 switch on the rising edge of the external clock \nsignal.\nSPRD has no effect when an external signal is applied \nto CLK.\nWatchdog\nWhen the MAX13253 is operating in external clock \nmode, a stalled clock can cause excessive DC current \nto flow through the primary winding of the transformer. \nThe MAX13253 integrates internal watchdog circuitry to \nprevent damage from this condition. The internal oscillator provides the switching signal to the driver whenever the \nperiod between edges on CLK exceeds the watchdog \ntimeout period of 20µs (min).\nSlew-Rate Control\nThe T1 and T2 drivers feature a controlled slew rate to \nlimit EMI.\nDisable Mode\nThe MAX13253 includes a pin-selectable disable mode to \nreduce current consumption. In disable mode the device \nconsumes less than 5µA (max) of supply current. The T1 \nand T2 outputs are high impedance in disable mode.\nPower-Up and Undervoltage Lockout\nThe MAX13253 provides an undervoltage lockout feature \nto ensure controlled power-up state and prevent operation \nbefore the oscillator has stabilized. On power-up and \nduring normal operation, if the supply voltage drops below \nthe V UVLO , the undervoltage-lockout circuit forces the \ndevice into disable mode. The T1 and T2 outputs are high \nimpedance in disable mode.\nOvercurrent Limiting\nThe MAX13253 features overcurrent limiting to protect \nthe IC from excessive currents when charging large \ncapacitive loads or driving into short circuits. Current \nlimiting is achieved in two stages: internal circuity monitors \nthe output current and detects when the peak current \nrises above 2A. When the 2A limit is exceeded, internal \nprotection circuitry is immediately enabled, reducing the \noutput current and regulating it to the 1.4A (typ) current-\nlimit threshold. The MAX13253 monitors the driver current \non a cycle-by-cycle basis, and the driver output current \nis regulated to the current-limit threshold until the short is \nremoved.\nThe MAX13253 can dissipate large amounts of power \nduring overcurrent limiting, causing the IC to enter \nthermal shutdown.\nFAULT  Output\nThe FAULT  output is asserted low during an overcurrent \nor overtemperature fault. FAULT  is an open-drain output.\nThermal Shutdown\nThe MAX13253 is protected from overtemperature \ndamage by integrated thermal-shutdown circuitry. When \nthe junction temperature (T J) exceeds +160ºC (typ), \nthe device is disabled and FAULT  is asserted. FAULT  \nis asserted for the duration of either an overcurrent or \novertemperature event. The device resumes normal \noperation when T J falls below +130°C (typ).Figure 3.

Ensure that \nthe power dissipation of the MAX13253 is kept below the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  for proper operation.\nHigh-Temperature Operation\nWhen the MAX13253 is operated under high ambient \ntemperatures, the power dissipated in the package \ncan raise the junction temperature close to the thermal \nshutdown threshold. Under such temperature conditions, \nthe power dissipation should be held low enough that the \njunction temperature observes a factor of safety margin.  \nThe maximum junction temperature should be held \nbelow +140°C. Use the package’s thermal resistance to \ncalculate the junction temperature. \nPower-Supply Decoupling\nBypass V DD to ground with a 1µF ceramic capacitor as \nclose as possible to the device.\nConnect at least 10µF between V DD and ground as \nclose as possible to the primary-side center tap of the \ntransformer. This capacitor helps to stabilize the voltage \non the supply line and protects the IC against large \nvoltage spikes on V DD.Output Voltage Regulation\nFor many applications, the unregulated output of the \nMAX13253 circuit meets output voltage tolerances. This \nconfiguration represents the highest efficiency possible. \nWhen the load currents on the transformer’s secondary \nside are low, the output voltage of the rectifier can \nstrongly increase. To protect downstream circuitry, limit \nthe output voltage when operating the circuit under low \nload conditions. If the minimum output load current is less \nthan approximately 5mA, connect a zener diode from the \noutput node of the rectifier to ground to limit the output \nvoltage to a safe value. \nFor applications requiring a regulated output voltage, \nMaxim provides several solutions. In the following \nexamples, assume a tolerance of ±10% for the input \nvoltage.\nExample 1: 5V to Isolated, Unregulated 6V\nIn the circuit of Figure 4 , the MAX13253 is used to generate \nan isolated 6V output. For a minimum input voltage of 5V, \nthe output voltage of the rectifier is approximately 6V.\nExample 2: 3.3V to Isolated, Regulated 5V\nIn the circuit of Figure 5 , the MAX8881 low-dropout linear \nregulator regulates the isolated output voltage to 5V. \nA 1:2 center-tapped transformer is used to step-up the \nsecondary side voltage from a 3.3V input. For a minimum \ninput voltage of 3.3V, the output voltage of the rectifier is \napproximately 5V.\nFigure 4. 5V to Isolated, Unregulated 6V Application CircuitFAULT1µF\n1µF\n10µF5V\nVDD\nEN\nCLKSPRDHICLK\nT1\nGND PGNDT2\n5V\nISO OUTPUT1CT:1.3CT\nMAX13253\nMAX13253 1A, Spread-Spectrum, Push-Pull, Transformer  \nDriver for Isolated Power Supplies\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 10\nIsolated USB/RS-485/RS-232 Isolated  \nApplications\nThe MAX13253 can provide isolated power for USB/\nRS-485/RS-232 applications. The 1A output current \ncapability of the MAX13253 allows multiple RS-485/\nRS-232 transceivers to operate simultaneously.\nPCB Layout Guidelines\nAs with all power-supply circuits, careful PCB layout is \nimportant to achieve low switching losses and stable \noperation. Connect the exposed pad to a solid copper \nground plane for optimum thermal performance.\nThe traces from T1 and T2 to the transformer must be \nlow-resistance and low-inductance paths. Locate the \ntransformer as closely as possible to the MAX13253 \nusing short, wide traces.\nIf possible, use a power plane for all V DD connections to \nthe MAX13253 and the primary-side of the transformer. If \na power plane is not available, avoid damage to the IC by \nensuring that the current flowing through the primary-side \ncenter tap of the transformer does not flow through the \nsame trace that connects the supply pin of the MAX13253 \nto the V DD source, and connect the primary-side center tap \nto the V DD supply using a very low-inductance connection.\nWhen the internal oscillator is used, it is possible for high \nfrequency switching on T1 and T2 to couple into the CLK \ncircuitry through PCB parasitic capacitance. This capacitive \ncoupling can induce duty cycle errors in the oscillator, \nresulting in a DC current through the transformer. For proper \noperation, ensure that CLK has a solid ground connection.Exposed Pad\nFor optimal thermal performance, ensure that the exposed \npad has a low thermal resistance connection to the \nground plane. Failure to provide a low thermal impedance \npath to the ground plane results in excessive junction \ntemperatures when dissipating high power.\nComponent Selection\nTransformer Selection\nTransformer selection for the MAX13253 can be simplified \nby the use of the ET product. The ET product relates the \nmaximum allowable magnetic flux density in a transformer \ncore to the voltage across a winding and switching period. \nInductor magnetizing current in the primary winding \nchanges linearly with time during the switching period \nof the MAX13253. Each transformer has a minimum ET \nproduct, though not always stated on the transformer data \nsheet. Ensure that the transformer selected for use with \nthe MAX13253 has an ET product of at least ET = V DD/\n(2 x f SW) for each half of the primary winding, where f SW \nis the minimum switching frequency of the T1 and T2 \nouputs. \nSelect a transformer with sufficient ET product for each \nhalf of the primary winding to ensure that the transformer \ndoes not saturate during operation. Saturation of the \nmagnetic core results in significantly reduced inductance \nof the primary, and therefore in a large increase in current \nflow. This can cause the current limit to be reached even \nwhen the lo ad is not high.Figure 5. 3.3V to Isolated, Regulated 5V Application CircuitFAULT SHDNIN1µF\n1µF\n10µF3.3V\nVDD\n4.7µF5V\nISO OUTPUT\nEN\nCLKSPRDHICLK\nT1\nGNDGNDOUT\nPGNDT21CT:2CT\nMAX13253MAX8881FB\nMAX13253 1A, Spread-Spectrum, Push-Pull, Transformer  \nDriver for Isolated Power Supplies\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 11\nFor example , when the internal oscillator is used to drive \nthe outputs and HICLK is low, the required transformer \nET product to the center tap for an application with V DD \n(max) = 5.5V, is 13.1V-µs.  An application with V DD (max) \n= 3.3V has a transformer ET product to the center tap \nrequirement of 7.9V-µs.\nIn addition to the constraint on ET product, choose \na transformer with low leakage inductance and low \nDC-winding resistance. Power dissipation of the \ntransformer due to the copper loss is approximated as: \nPD_TX  = ILOAD2 x (R PRI/N2 + R SEC)\nwhere R PRI is the DC winding resistance of the primary, \nand R SEC is the DC winding resistance of the secondary. \nIn most cases, an optimum is reached when R SEC = \nRPRI/N2. For this condition, the power dissipation is equal \nfor the primary and secondary windings. \nAs with all power-supply designs, it is important to optimize \nefficiency. In designs incorporating small transformers, \nthe possibility of thermal runaway makes low transformer \nefficiencies problematic. Transformer losses produce \na temperature rise that reduces the efficiency of the \ntransformer. The lower efficiency, in turn, produces an \neven larger temperature rise. \nTo ensure that the transformer meets these requirements \nunder all operating conditions, the design should focus on \nthe worst-case conditions. The most stringent demands \non ET product arise for maximum input voltage, minimum \nswitching frequency, and maximum temperature and load \ncurrent. Additionally, the worst-case values for transformer \nand rectifier losses should be considered.The primary must be center-tapped; however the \nsecondary winding may or may not be center-tapped, \ndepending on the rectifier topology used. The phasing \nbetween primary and secondary windings is not critical. \nThe transformer turns ratio must be set to provide \nthe minimum required output voltage at the maximum \nanticipated load with the minimum expected input voltage. \nIn addition, include in the calculations an allowance for \nthe worst-case losses in the rectifiers. Since the turns \nratio determined in this manner will ordinarily produce a \nmuch higher voltage at the secondary under conditions \nof high input voltage and/or light loading, be careful to \nprevent an overvoltage condition from occurring.\nTransformers for use with the MAX13253 are typically \nwound on a high-permeability magnetic core. To minimize \nradiated electromagnetic emissions, select a toroid, pot \ncore, E/I/U cor e, or equivalent.\nDiode Selection\nThe high switching speed capability of the MAX13253 \nnecessitates high-speed rectifiers. Ordinary silicon signal \ndiodes such as the 1N914 or 1N4148 can be used for low-\noutput current levels (less than 50mA), but at high output \ncurrent levels, their reverse recovery times might degrade \nefficiency. At higher output currents, select low forward-\nvoltage Schottky diodes to improve efficiency. Ensure \nthat the average forward current rating for the rectifier \ndiodes exceeds the maximum load current of the circuit.  \nFor surface-mount applications, Schottky diodes such as \nthe B230A, MBRS230, and MBRS320 are recommended.\nTable 1.
