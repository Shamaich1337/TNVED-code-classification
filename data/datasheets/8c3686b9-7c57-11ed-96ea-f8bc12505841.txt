When the CE# goes high, the device is deselected. However, when the device is at busy stage, the device will not go to standby mode when CE# pin goes high.\nREAD ENABLE: RE#\nThe RE# (Read Enable) allows the data to be \noutput by a tREA time after the falling edge of RE#. The internal address counter is automatically increased by one at the falling edge of RE#.\nWRITE ENABLE: WE#\nWhen the WE# goes low, the address/data/\ncommand are latched at the rising edge of WE#.  COMMAND LATCH ENABLE: CLE\nThe CLE controls the command input. When the CLE goes high, the command data is latched at the rising edge of the WE#.\nADDRESS LATCH ENABLE: ALE\nThe ALE controls the address input.  When the ALE \ngoes high, the address is latched at the rising edge of WE#.\nWRITE PROTECT: WP#\nThe WP# signal keeps low and then the memory will \nnot accept the program/erase operation. It is recom -\nmended to keep WP# pin low during power on/off sequence. Please refer to the waveform of "Power On/Off Sequence".\nREADY/Busy: R/B#\nThe R/B# is an open-drain output pin. The R/B# \noutputs the ready/busy status of read/program/erase operation of the device. When the R/B# is at low, the device is busy for read or program or erase operation.  When the R/B# is at high, the read/program/erase operation is finished. \nPlease refer to Section 9-1  for details.\n14\nP/N: PM2192 REV. 1.1, January 24, 2017MX60LF8G18AC4.

External reads begins after the R/B# pin \ngoes to READY.\nThe Read operation may also be initiated by writing the 00h command and giving the address (column and \nrow address) and being confirmed by the 30h command, the MX60LF8G18AC begins the internal read operation and the chip enters busy state. The data can be read out  in sequence after the chip is ready. Refer to the waveform for Read Operation as below.\nIf the host side uses a sequential access time (tRC) of less than 30ns, the data can be latched on the next \nfalling edge of RE# as the waveform of EDO mode ( Figure 9-2 ).\nTo access the data in the same page randomly, a command of 05h may be written and only column address following and then confirmed by E0h command.\n19\nP/N: PM2192 REV. 1.1, January 24, 2017MX60LF8G18ACFigure 7.

Cache Read Sequential\nThe cache read sequential operation is for throughput enhancement by using the internal cache buffer. It \nallows the consecutive pages to be read-out without giving next page address, which reduces the latency time from tR to tRCBSY between pages or blocks. While the data is read out on one page, the data of next page can be read into the cache buffer.  \nAfter writing the 00h command, the column and row address should be given for the start page selection, \nand followed by the 30h command for address confirmation. After that, the CACHE READ operation starts after a latency time tR and following a 31h command with the latency time of tRCBSY , the data can be read-\nout sequentially from 1\nst column address (A[11:0]=00h) without giving next page address input. The 31h \ncommand is necessary to confirm the next cache read sequential operation and followed by a tRCBSY  \nlatency time before next page data is necessary.  The CACHE READ SEQUENTIAL command is also valid for the consecutive page cross block. \nThe random data out (05h-E0h) command set is available to change the column address of the current page \ndata in the cache register. \nThe user can check the chip status by the following method: - R/B# pin ("0" means the data is not ready, "1" means the user can read the data) - Status Register (SR[6] functions the same as R/B# pin, SR[5] indicates the internal chip operation, "0" \nmeans the chip is in internal operation and "1" means the chip is idle.) Status Register can be checked after the Read Status command (70h) is issued. Command 00h should be given to return to the cache read sequential operation. \nTo confirm the last page to be read-out during the cache read sequential operation, a 3Fh command is \nneeded to replace the 31h command prior to the last data-out.\nWhen the cache read operation is applied to the die boundary, there is a restriction - the 31h (cache read \nsequential) command should not be issue to cross the die boundary . However\n , the 3Fh (cache read end) \ncommand is accepted on the die boundary.\n24\nP/N: PM2192 REV. 1.1, January 24, 2017MX60LF8G18ACIO[7:0]CLE\nALECE#\nWE#\nPage 1tWBtRCBSYtRC\nRE#\nR/B#00h31h\nBusytAR\ntRRtCLR\nDout 0Page 1\nDout 1Page 1\nDout 2111tWB\n30h\nBusy\nPage 2\nDout 1Page 2\nDout 2111Page 3tRC\n3FhtAR\ntRRtCLR\nDout 0Page 3\nDout 1Page 3\nDout 2111\nBusyIO[7:0]CLE\nALECE#\nWE#\nRE#\nR/B#A\n1st Address\nCycle2nd Address\nCycle3rd Address\nCycle4th Address\nCycle5th Address\nCycle\ntWBtRCBSY\nPage 1\nDout 2111Page 2tWBtRCBSYtRC\n31htAR\ntRRtCLR\nDout 0\nBusyAtRFigure 11-1.

Cache Read Random\nThe main difference from the Cache Read Sequential operation is the Cache Read Random operation may \nallow the random page to be read-out with cache operation not just for the consecutive page only. \nAfter writing the 00h command, the column and row address should be given for the start page selection, \nand followed by the 30h command for address confirmation. The column address is ignored in the cache read random operation. And then, the CACHE READ RANDOM operation starts after a latency time tR and following a 00h command with the selected page address and following a 31h command, the data can be read-out after the latency time of tRCBSY. After the previous selected page data out, a new selected page address can be given by writing the 00h-31h command set again. The CACHE READ RANDOM command is also valid for the consecutive page cross block.\nThe random data out (05h-E0h) command set is available to change the column address of the current page \ndata in the cache register.  \nThe user can check the chip status by the following method: - R/B# pin ("0" means the data is not ready, "1" means the user can read the data) - Status Register can be checked after the Read Status command (70h) is issued. (SR[6] behaves the same \nas R/B# pin, SR[5] indicates the internal chip operation, "0" means the chip is in internal operation and "1" means the chip is idle.) Command 00h should be given to return to the cache read operation. \nTo confirm the last page to be read-out during the cache read operation, a 3Fh command is needed to replace \nthe 31h command prior to the last data-out.\n26\nP/N: PM2192 REV. 1.1, January 24, 2017MX60LF8G18ACIO[7:0]CLE\nALECE#\nWE#\nPage ntRC\nRE#\nR/B#00htRR\nDout 0Page n\nDout 1Page n\nDout 2111tWBtR\n30h\nBusy\nIO[7:0]CLE\nALECE#\nWE#\nRE#\nR/B#00htWBtRCBSY\n31h\nBusytARtCLR\nPage n\nDout 1Page n\nDout 2111Page mtRC\ntRR\nDout 0Page m\nDout 1Page m\nDout 2111 00htWBtRCBSY\n31h\nBusytARtCLR\nPage n\nDout 0A\nA1st Address\nCycle2nd Address\nCycle3rd Address\nCycle4th Address\nCycle5th Address\nCycle\n5th Address\nCycle5th Address\nCycle4th Address\nCycle\n4th Address\nCycle3rd Address\nCycle\n3rd Address\nCycle2nd Address\nCycle2nd Address\nCycle\n1st Address\nCycle1st Address\nCycle\nPage n addressPage m address\nPage x addressFigure 11-2.

After Program load command (80h) is issued \nand the row and column address is given,  the data will be loaded into the chip sequentially . Random Data \nInput command (85h) allows multi-data load in non-sequential address. After data load is complete, program \nconfirm command (10h) is issued to start the page program operation. The page program operation in a block should start from the low address to high address. Partial program in a page is allowed up to 4 times. However, the random data input mode for programming a page is allowed and number of times is not limited. \nThe status of the program completion can be detected by R/B# pin or Status register bit SR[6].The program result is shown in the chip status bit (SR[0]). SR[0] = 1 indicates the Page Program is not \nsuccessful and SR[0] = 0 means the program operation is successful.\nDuring the Page Program progressing, only the read status register command and reset command are \naccepted, others are ignored. \nFigure 12.

Cache Program\nThe cache program feature enhances the program performance by using the cache buf fer of 2,112-byte. \nThe serial data can be input to the cache buffer while the previous data stored in the buffer are programming \ninto the memory cell. Cache Program command sequence is almost the same as page program command sequence. Only the Program Confirm command (10h) is replaced by cache Program command (15h). \nAfter the Cache Program command (15h) is issued. The user can check the status by the following methods.- R/B# pin- Cache Status Bit (SR[6] = 0 indicates the cache is busy; SR[6] = 1 means the cache is ready).The user can issue another Cache Program Command Sequence after the Cache is ready. The user can \nalways monitor the chip state with Ready/Busy Status Bit (SR[5]) by issuing the 70h or 78h command to read status.  To use the Status Enhanced Read (78h) for reading each die status if the cross die cache program operation failed. The user can issues either program confirm command (10h) or cache program command (15h) for the last page if the user monitor the chip status by issuing Read Status Command (70h). \nHowever, if the user only monitors the R/B# pin, the user needs to issue the program confirm command (10h) \nfor the last page.\nThe user can check the Pass/Fail Status through P/F Status Bit (SR[0]) and Cache P/F Status Bit (SR[1]). \nSR[1] represents Pass/Fail Status of the previous page. SR[1] is updated when SR[6] change from 0 to 1 or Chip is ready. SR[0] shows the Pass/Fail status of the current page. It is updated when SR[5] change from "0" to "1" or the end of the internal programming.

Block Erase\nThe MX60LF8G18AC supports a block erase command. This command will erase a block of 64 pages asso -\nciated with the most significant address bits.\nThe completion of the erase operation can be detected by R/B# pin or Status register bit (IO6).

This command is valid only \nwhen internal all die are ready.The ID READ command sequence includes one command Byte (90h), one address byte (00h).  The Read ID command 90h may provide the manufacturer ID (C2h) of one-byte and device ID (D3h) of one-byte, also Byte2, Byte3, and Byte4 ID code are followed.\nThe device support ONFI Parameter Page Read, by sending the ID Read (90h) command and following one \nbyte address (20h), the four-byte data returns the value of 4Fh-4Eh-46h-49h for the ASCII code of "O"-"N"-\n"F"-"I" to identify the ONFI parameter page.\nTable 2.

Status Read\nThe MX60LF8G18AC provides a status register that outputs the device status by writing a command code \n70h, and then the IO pins output the status at the falling edge of CE# or RE# which occurs last.  Even though when multiple flash devices are connecting in system and the R/B#pins are common-wired, the two lines of CE# and RE# may be checked for individual devices status separately .  \nThe 8Gb has two dies in a package. The status read command will only output the status of the latest selected die.  To avoid the data-bus contention, the status read command should not be used on the interleaved operation. The status enhanced read command can be used for the status check during/after multi-die operations.\nThe status read command 70h will keep the device at the status read mode unless next valid command is \nissued. The resulting information is outlined in  Table 4. as below. \nPin Status                     Related Mode Value\nSR[0] Chip StatusPage Program, Cache \nProgram (Page N),  Block Erase  0: Passed\n1: Failed  \nSR[1]Cache Program  Result Cache Program  \n(Page N-1)0: Passed 1: Failed\nSR[2-4] Not Used\nSR[5]Ready / Busy  \n(For P/E/R Controller)  Cache Program/Cache Read operation, other Page Program/Block Erase/Read are same as IO6 (Note 1)0: Busy 1: Ready\nSR[6] Ready / BusyPage Program, Block Erase, Cache Program, Read, Cache Read (Note 2)0: Busy 1: Ready\nSR[7] Write ProtectPage Program, Block Erase, Cache Program, Read0: Protected 1: Unprotected \nNotes:\n 1.

Status Enhance Read\nThe 8Gb support the two-plane operation, the Status Enhanced Read command (78h) of fers the alternative \nmethod besides the Status Read command to get the status of specific plane in the same NAND Flash \ndevice.  The 8Gb has two dies in a package. The status enhance read command (78h) may output the status of ready/busy of selected die.\nThe SR[6] and SR[5] bits are shared with all planes of the selected die. However , the SR[0], SR[1], SR[3], \nSR[4] are for the status of specific plane in the row address. The Status Enhanced Read command is not \nallowed at power-on Reset (FFh) command, OTP enabled operation.\nThe selected die will stay in the status enhanced read mode until another valid command issuing. The non-\naddressed die which is remaining diselected to avoid the data-bus contention.\nThe Status Enhance Read command also can be used for selected die data output.  After writing the 78h \ncommand followed by the three address cycles, the status of the selected die is output, after the selected die is ready, writing the read mode command (00h) and then it begins data-out.\nFigure 20.

Unique ID Read (ONFI)\nThe unique ID is 32-byte and with 16 copies for back-up purpose. After writing the Unique ID read command \n(EDh) and following the one address byte (00h), the host may read out the unique ID data. The host need to \nXOR the 1st 16-byte unique data and the 2nd 16-byte complement data to get the result, if the result is FFh, \nthe unique ID data is correct; otherwise, host need to repeat the XOR with the next copy of Unique ID data.\nOnce sending the EDh command, the NAND device will remain in the Unique ID read mode until next valid \ncommand is sent.  This command is valid only when internal all die are ready.\nTo change the data output location, it is recommended to use the Random Data Out command set (05h-E0h).The Status Read command (70h) can be used to check the completion. T\n o continue the read operation, a \nfollowing read command (00h) to re-enable the data out is necessary.\nFigure 24.

Feature Set Operation (ONFI)\nThe Feature Set operation is to change the default power-on feature sets by using the Set Feature and Get \nFeature command and writing the specific parameter data (P1-P4) on the specific feature addresses. The NAND device may remain the current feature set until next power cycle since the feature set data is volatile. However, the reset command (FFh) can not reset the current feature set.\nTable 6-1.

After sending the Set Feature \ncommand (EFh) and following specific feature and then input the P1-P4 parameter data to change the default power-on feature set. Once sending the EFh command, the NAND device will remain in the Set Feature mode until next valid command is sent. This command is valid only when internal all die are ready.\nThe Status Read command (70h) may check the completion of the Set Feature.\nFigure 26.

AC Waveforms for Get Feature (ONFI) Operation6-14-2.  Get Feature (ONFI)\nThe Get Feature command is to read sub-feature parameter. After sending the Get Feature command (EEh) \nand following specific feature, the host may read out the P1-P4 sub- feature parameter data.  Once sending the EEh command, the NAND device will remain in the Get Feature mode until next valid command is sent.  This command is valid only when internal all die are ready.\nThe Status Read command (70h) can be used to check the completion.

Secure OTP (One-Time-Programmable) Feature\nThere is an OTP area which has thirty full pages (30 x 2,112-byte) guarantee to be good for system \ndevice serial number storage or other fixed code storage. The OTP area is a non-erasable and one-time-programmable area, which is default to “1” and allows whole page or partial page program to be “0”, once the OTP protection mode is set, the OTP area becomes read-only and cannot be programmed again.\nThe OTP operation is operated by the Set Feature/ Get Feature operation to access the OTP operation mode \nand OTP protection mode.\nTo check the NAND device is ready or busy in the OTP operation mode, either checking the R/B# or writing \nthe Status Read command (70h) may collect the status. \nTo exit the OTP operation or protect mode, it can be done by writing 00h to P1 at feature address 90h.\nOTP Read/Program Operation\nTo enter the OTP operation mode, it is by using the Set Feature command (EFh) and followed by the feature \naddress (90h) and then input the 01h to P1 and 00h to P2-P4 of sub-Feature Parameter data( please refer to the sub-Feature Parameter table). After enter the OTP operation mode, the normal Read command (00h-30h) or Page program( 80h-10h) command can be used to read the OTP area or program it. The address of OTP is located on the 02h-1Fh of page address.  \nBesides the normal Read command, the Random Data Output command (05h-E0h) can be used for read \nOTP data.  However, the Cache Read command is not supported in the OTP area. \nBesides the normal page program command, the Random Data Input command (85h) allows multi-data load \nin non-sequential address. After data load is completed, a program confirm command (10h) is issued to start the page program operation. The number of partial-page OTP program is 8 per each OTP page. \nFigure 28.

To enter the \nOTP protection mode, it can be done by using the Set Feature command (EFh) and followed by the feature address (90h) and then input the 03h to P1 and 00h to P2-P4 of sub-Feature Parameter data (please refer to the sub-Feature Parameter table). And then the normal page program command (80h-10h) with the address 00h before the 10h command is required.\nThe OTP Protection mode is operated by the whole OTP area instead of individual OTP page. Once the OTP \nprotection mode is set, the OTP area cannot be programmed or unprotected again.\nFigure 32.

Two-Plane Operations\nThe 8Gb NAND device is divided into two planes in each die for performance improvement. In the two-plane \noperation, the NAND device may proceed the same type operation (for example: Program or Erase) on the two planes of a die concurrent or overlapped by the two-plane command sets.  The different type operations cannot be done in the two-plane operations; for example, it cannot be done to erase one plane and program the other plane concurrently. The two-plane operations should be in the same die.\nThe plane address A18 must be different from each selected plane address. The page address A12-A17 of \nindividual plane must be the same for two-plane operation.\nThe Status Read command( 70h) may check the device status in the two-plane operation, if the result is \nfailed and then the Status Enhanced Read (78h) may check which plane is failed.\n6-16.  Two-plane Program (ONFI) and Two-plane Cache Program (ONFI)\nThe two-plane program command (80h-11h) may input data to cache buffer and wait for the final plane data input with command (80h-10h) and then transfer all data to NAND array. As for the two-plane cache program operation, it can be achieved by a two-plane program command (80h-1 1h) with a cache program command \n(80h-15h), and the final address input with the confirm command (80h-10h). Please refer to the waveforms of two-plane program and two-plane cache program for details. The random data input command (85h) can be also used in the two-plane program operation for changing the column address, please refer to the waveform of two-plane program with random data input.\nNotes: \n 1.  Page number should be the same for both planes. \n 2. Block address [29:18] can be different, A30 should be the same for both planes.\n For examples: \n    If the user issues 80h-(block address 5h, page address 5h) -1 1h - 80h -  \n   (block address - 18h, page address 5h) - 10h, \n   The programmed page is\n    - Plane 0: block address 18h, page address 5h\n    - Plane 1: block address 5h, page address 5h\n     Note:  Die selection address = A30, Block address = A [29:18], Page address = A [17:12]\n56\nP/N: PM2192 REV. 1.1, January 24, 2017MX60LF8G18ACFigure 33-1.

The interleaved Die Operations are allowed on the following commands: Read Mode, Page Program, T\n wo planes Page Program, \nCache Program, Two Planes Cache Program, Block Erase and Two planes Block Erase. For the interleaved Die operations with Two planes page program, Two planes cache program and Two planes block erase, the die address (A30) should be the same.\nA series program operation must be applied before a series read operation while a interleaved die operation \ninvolves a series read operation and a series program operation.  To avoid the cache register data be cleared out by 80h command, the data of read operation must be sent to host before the next program operation applies.  \nTo check the operation status during the Interleaved Die Operations, a data polling of R/B# may determine the \noperation completion of all dies. The R/B# signal is 0, which means any die is busy; R/B# signal is 1, which means all dies are ready.  The other way to check the operation completion is to send Status Enhance Read command (78h) to select die for individual die status.  Please note the Status Read command (70h) must not be applied for the status check during the Interleaved Die Operation. It will cause data-bus contention. \nAs for the cache operation during the Interleaved Die Operation, the status bit SR[6] returns to "1" when the \ninternal cache is available to receive new data. When all operations are completed on a die, the SR[5] shows “1”. \nThe Interleaved Die Operations cannot be applied after the following command: RESET  (FFh), ID read (90h), \nParameter Page Read (ECh), Unique ID Read (EDh), Set Feature (EFh), Get Feature (EEh).  After the the \nSR[5] shows “1” ready, and then  the Interleaved Die Operation may be applied.\n60\nP/N: PM2192 REV. 1.1, January 24, 2017MX60LF8G18ACIO[7:0]\nR/B#60h D0h 60h D0h 78h Dout1st Address\nCycle2nd Address\nCycle3rd Address\nCycle1st Address\nCycle2nd Address\nCycle3rd Address\nCycle1st Address\nCycle2nd Address\nCycle3rd Address\nCycle\nBusy78h Dout 1st Address\nCycle2nd Address\nCycle3rd Address\nCycle\nDie 0 (A30 = 0) Die 0 (A30 = 0) Die 1 (A30 = 1) Die 1 (A30 = 1)\nNote: Busy time is variable by Die 1 command input sequence following by Die 0 command inputFigure 36-1.

R/B#: Termination for The Ready/Busy# Pin  (R/B#)\nThe R/B# is an open-drain output pin and a pull-up resistor is necessary to add on the R/B# pin. The R/B# \noutputs the ready/busy status of read/program/ erase operation of the device. When the R/B# is at low , the \ndevice is busy for read or program or erase operation. When the R/B# is at high, the read/program/erase \noperation is finished.    \nRp Value Guidence\nThe rise time of the R/B# signal depends on the combination of Rp and capacitive loading of the R/B# circuit.  \nIt is approximately two times constants (Tc) between the 10% and 90% points on the R/B# waveform.\n  TC = R × C\nWhere R = Rp (Resistance of pull-up resistor), and C = CL (Total capacitive load)\nThe fall time of the R/B# signal majorly depends on the output impedance of the R/B# signal and the total load capacitance.\n                     \nVcc (Max.) - VOL (Max.)  Rp (Min.) =                                                           \n             IOL+ΣIL                             \nNotes: \n 1. Considering of the variation of device-by-device, the above data is for reference to decide the            \n    resistor value. \n 2.

During the internal power on reset period, no any external command is accepted. There are two \nways to identify the termination of the internal power on reset sequence. Please refer to Figure 40.

Invalid Blocks (Bad Blocks) \nThe bad blocks are included in the device while it gets shipped. During the time of using the device, the \nadditional bad blocks might be increasing; therefore, it is recommended to check the bad block marks and avoid using the bad blocks. Furthermore, please read out the bad block information before any erase operation since it may be cleared by any erase operation.\nFigure 42. Bad Blocks\nWhile the device is shipped, the value of all data bytes of the good blocks are FFh. The 1st byte of the \n1st and 2nd page in the spare area for bad block will be 00h. The erase operation at the bad blocks is not recommended. \nAfter the device is installed in the system, the bad block checking is recommended. The figure shows the brief \ntest flow by the system software managing the bad blocks while the bad blocks were found. When a block gets damaged, it should not be used any more. \nDue to the blocks are isolated from bit-line by the selected gate, the performance of good blocks will not be \nimpacted by bad ones.

Unit Remark\nValid (Good)  \nBlock Number 8Gb  8032 8192 BlockBlock 0 is guaranteed to be good (with ECC).\nNote:  the 8Gb consists of two 4Gb dies, each die has minimum 4016 valid blocks.Table 15. Valid Blocks\n75\nP/N: PM2192 REV. 1.1, January 24, 2017MX60LF8G18AC9-2. Bad Block Test Flow\nAlthough the initial bad blocks are marked by the flash vendor, they could be inadvertently erased and \ndestroyed by a user that does not pay attention to them. To prevent this from occurring, it is necessary to always know where any bad blocks are located. Continually checking for bad block markers during normal use would be very time consuming, so it is highly recommended to initially locate all bad blocks and build a bad block table and reference it during normal NAND flash use. This will prevent having the initial bad block markers erased by an unexpected program or erase operation. Failure to keep track of bad blocks can be fatal for the application. For example, if boot code is programmed into a bad block, a boot up failure may occur. The following section shows the recommended flow for creating a bad block table.\nFigure 43.

Failure Phenomena for Read/Program/Erase Operations\nThe device may fail during a Read, Program or Erase operation. The following possible failure modes should \nbe considered when implementing a highly reliable system:\nTable 16.

Program\nIt is feasible to reprogram the data into another page (Page B) when an error occurred in Page A by loading \nfrom an external buffer. Then create a bad block table or by using another appropriate scheme to prevent \nfurther system accesses to Page A.\nFigure 44. Failure Modes\n9-5.
