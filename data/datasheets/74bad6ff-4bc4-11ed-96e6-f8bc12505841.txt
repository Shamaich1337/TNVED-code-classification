They\nare designed to enable a new generation of low port count, cost-sensitive, and power effi cient 10/100 Mbps switch sys-\ntems. Low power consumption, advanced power management, and so phisticated QoS features (e.g., IPv6 priority clas-\nsification support) make these devices ideal for IPTV , IP-STB, VoIP, automotive, and industrial applications.\nThe KSZ8873 family is designed to support the GREEN requ irement in today’s switch systems. Advanced power man-\nagement schemes include hardware power down, software power down, per port power down, and the energy detect\nmode that shuts downs the transceiver when a port is idle.\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL also offer a bypass mode. In this mode , the processor connected to the switch through the MII\ninterface can be shut down without im pacting the normal switch operation.\nThe configurations provided by  the KSZ8873 family enables the flexibility to meet requirements of di fferent applications: \n• KSZ8873MLL: Two 10/100BASE-T/TX tr ansceivers and one MII interface.\n• KSZ8873RLL: Two 10/100BASE-T/TX transceivers and one RMII interface.\n• KSZ8873FLL: Two 100BASE-FX transceivers and one MII interface.\nThe devices are available in RoHS-compliant 64-pin LQFP  packages. Industrial-grade and qualified AEC-Q100 Auto-\nmotive-grade versions are also available.\nFIGURE 1-1: SYSTEM  BLOCK DIAGRAM\n1K LOOK-UP\nENGINE\nQUEUE\nMANAGEMENT\nBUFFER\nMANAGEMENT\nFRAME\nBUFFERS\nMIB\nCOUNTERS\nEEPROM\nINTERFACE\nYTIROIRP ,GNIGGAT NALV ,LORTNOC WOLF ,OFIF\n10/100\nMAC 1\n10/100\nMAC 2\n10/100\nMAC 310/100\nT/TX/FX\nPHY 1\n10/100\nT/TX/FX\nPHY 2HP AUTO\nMDIX\nHP AUTO\nMDIX\nMII/SNI\nSPI SPI\nCONTROL\nREGISTERSMIIM\nSMI\nSTRAP IN\nCONFIGURATIONLED\nDRIVERSI2C\nP1 LED[1:0]\nP2 LED[1:0]\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

In a managed design,\nthe host processor has complete control of the KSZ8873MLL/ FLL/RLL via the SMI interface,  MIIM interface, SPI bus,\nor I2C bus. An unmanaged design is achieved through I/O strapping and/or EEPROM programming at system reset\ntime.\nOn the media side, the KSZ 8873MLL/FLL/RLL supports I EEE 802.3 10BASE-T and 100B ASE-TX on both PHY ports.\nPhysical signal transmission and reception are enhanced thro ugh the use of patented analog circuitries that make the\ndesign more efficient and allow for lower power consumption and smaller chip die size.\n3.1 Physical Layer Transceiver\n3.1.1 100BASE-TX TRANSMIT\nThe 100BASE-TX transmit function  performs parallel-to-serial conversion, 4B/5B coding, scramblin g, NRZ-to-NRZI con-\nversion, and MLT3 encoding and transmission. \nThe circuitry starts with a parallel-to-serial conversion, wh ich converts the MII data from the MAC into a 125 MHz serial\nbit stream. The data and control stream is then converted into 4B/5B coding, followed by a scrambler. The serialized\ndata is further converted from NRZ-to- NRZI format, and then transmitted in MLT3 current output. The output current is\nset by an external 1% 11.8 k Ω resistor for the 1:1 transformer ratio.\nThe output signal has a typical rise/fall time of 4 ns and complies with the ANSI TP-PMD standard regarding amplitude\nbalance, overshoot, an d timing jitter. The wave-shaped 10BASE-T output is also inco rporated into the 100BASE-TX\ntransmitter.\n3.1.2 100BASE-TX RECEIVE\nThe 100BASE-TX receiver function perfor ms adaptive equalizat ion, DC restoration, MLT3-t o-NRZI conversion, data and\nclock recovery, NRZI-to-NRZ conversion, de-scrambling,  4B/5B decoding, and serial-to-parallel conversion. \nThe receiving side starts with the equalization filter to com pensate for inter-symbol interfer ence (ISI) over the twisted\npair cable. Because the amplitude loss a nd phase distortion is a function of the cable length, the equa lizer must adjust\nits characteristics to optimize performanc e. In this design, the variable equalizer  makes an initial estimation based on\ncomparisons of incoming signal strength against some know n cable characteristics, and th en tunes itself for optimiza-\ntion. This is an ongoing process and self-adjusts agains t environmental changes such as temperature variations.\nNext, the equalized signal goes through a DC restoration and data conversion block. The DC restoration circuit is used\nto compensate for the effect of baseline wander and to improve the dynamic range. Th e differential data conversion\ncircuit converts the MLT3 format back to NRZI. The slicing threshold is also adaptive.\nThe clock recovery circuit extracts the 125 MHz clock from  the edges of the NRZI signal. This recovered clock is then\nused to convert the NRZI signal into the NRZ format. This si gnal is sent through the de-scrambler followed by the 4B/\n5B decoder. Finally, the NRZ serial data is converted to the MII format and provided as the input data to the MAC.\n3.1.3 PLL CLOCK SYNTHESIZER\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL generates 12 5 MHz, 62.5 MHz, and 31.25 MHz clocks for system timing. Internal clocks\nare generated from an external 25 MHz or 50 MHz crystal or oscillator. KSZ8873RLL can generate a 50 MHz reference\nclock for the RMII interface.\n3.1.4 SCRAMBLER/DE-SCRAMBLER (100BASE-TX ONLY)\nThe purpose of the scrambler is to spr ead the power spectrum of the signal to reduce electromagnetic  interference (EMI)\nand baseline wander. Transmitted data is scrambled through the use of an 11-bit wide linear feedback shift register\n(LFSR). The scrambler generates a 2047-bit non-repetitive  sequence, and the receiver then de-scrambles the incoming\ndata stream using the same s equence as at the transmitter.\n3.1.5 100BASE-FX OPERATION\n100BASE-FX operation is similar to 100BASE-TX operation wi th the differences being that the scrambler/de-scrambler\nand MLT3 encoder/decoder are bypassed on transmission and reception. In addition, auto-n egotiation is bypassed and\nauto MDI/MDI-X is disabled.\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS00002348A-page 13KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\n3.1.6 100BASE-FX SIGNAL DETECTION\nIn 100BASE-FX operation, FXSD (fiber sig nal detect), input pins 15 and 63, is us ually connected to the fiber transceiver\nSD (signal detect) output pin. The fiber signal threshold ca n be selected by register 192 bit 7 and 6 respectively for port\n1 and port 2. When FXSD is less than the threshold, no fibe r signal is detected and a far-end fault (FEF) is generated.\nWhen FXSD is over the threshold, the fiber signal is detected.\nAlternatively, the designer may choose not to implement the FEF feature. In this case, the FXSD input pin is tied high\nto force 100BASE-FX mode.\n100BASE-FX signal detection is summarized in Table 3-1 :\nTo ensure proper operation, a resistive voltage divider is recommended to adjust the fiber transceiver SD output voltage\nswing to match the FXSD pin’s input voltage threshold.\n3.1.7 100BASE-FX FAR-END FAULT\nA far-end fault (FEF) occurs when the signal detection is logi cally false on the receive side of the fiber transceiver. The\nKSZ8873FLL detects a FEF when its FXSD input is below the Fiber Signal Threshold. When a FEF is detected, the\nKSZ8873FLL signals its fiber link partner that a FEF has occurred by sending 84 1’s followed by a zero in the idle period\nbetween frames. By default, FEF is enabled. FEF can be disabled through register setting.\n3.1.8 10BASE-T TRANSMIT\nThe 10BASE-T driver is incorporated with the 100BASE-TX dr iver to allow for transmission using the same magnetics.\nThey are internally wave-shaped and pr e-emphasized into outputs with a typical 2. 3V amplitude. The harmonic contents\nare at least 27 dB below the fundamental frequency when driven by an all-ones Manchester-encoded signal.\n3.1.9 10BASE-T RECEIVE\nOn the receive side, input buffers and level detecting squelch circuits are employed. A differential input receiver circuit\nand a phase-locked loop (PLL) perform the decoding function. The Manchester- encoded data stream is separated into\nclock signal and NRZ data. A squelch circuit rejects signals with levels less than 400 mV or with short pulse widths to\nprevent noise at the RXP-or-RXM input from falsely trigge ring the decoder. When the input exceeds the squelch limit,\nthe PLL locks onto the incoming  signal and the KSZ88 73MLL/FLL/RLL deco des a data frame. The receiver clock is\nmaintained active during idle periods in between data reception.\n3.1.10 MDI/MDI-X AUTO CROSSOVER\nTo eliminate the need for crossover cables between simila r devices, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL supports HP Auto MDI/\nMDI-X and IEEE 802.3u standard MDI/MDI-X auto cr ossover. HP Auto MDI/MDI-X is the default.\nThe auto-sense function detects remote transmit and receive pa irs and correctly assigns tran smit and receive pairs for\nthe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL device. This feature is extremely useful when end users are unaware of cable types and\nalso saves on an additional uplink configuration connec tion. The auto-crossover feature can be disabled through the\nport control registers or MIIM PHY registers.\nThe IEEE 802.3u standard MDI and MDI-X definitions are illustrated in Table 3-2 .TABLE 3-1: FX SIGNAL THRESHOLD\nRegister 192 Bit 7 (Port 2), Bit 6 (Port 1) Fiber Signal Threshold at FXSD\n12 . 0 V\n01 . 2 V\nTABLE 3-2: MDI/MDI-X PIN DEFINITIONS\nMDI MDI-X\nRJ-45 Pins Signals RJ-45 Pins Signals\n1 TD+ 1 RD+\n2T D –2R D –\n3 RD+ 3 TD+\n6 RD– 6 TD–\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 14  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.3.1.10.1 Straight Cable\nA straight cable connects an MDI device to an MDI-X device, or an MDI-X device to an MDI device.

In\nauto-negotiation, link partners advertise t heir capabilities across the link to each  other. If auto-negotiation is not sup-\nported or the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RL L link partner is forced to bypass auto -negotiation, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL sets\nits operating mode by observing the signal at its receiv er. This is known as parallel detection, and allows the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL to establish link by listening for a fixed si gnal protocol in the absence of auto-negotiation adver-\ntisement protocol.\nThe link up process is shown in Figure 3-3 .FIGURE 3-2: TYPICAL CROSSOVER CABLE CONNECTION\n \nReceive Pair Receive Pair\nTransmit Pair1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n81\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8Transmit Pair10/100 Ethernet\nMedia Dependent Interface10/100 Ethernet\nMedia Dependent Interface\nModular Connector (RJ-45)\nHUB\n(Repeater or Switch)Modular Connector (RJ-45)\nHUB\n(Repeater or Switch)Crossover\nCable\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 16  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.FIGURE 3-3: AUTO-NEGOTIATIO N AND PARALLEL OPERATION\n3.1.12 LINKMD® CABLE DIAGNOSTICS\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL supports LinkMD. The LinkMD feature utilizes time domain reflectometry (TDR) to analyze the\ncabling plant for common cabling problems such as o pen circuits, short circuits, and impedance mismatches.\nLinkMD works by sending a pulse of known amplitude and duration down the MDI and MDI-X pairs and then analyzes\nthe shape of the reflected signal. Timing the pulse duration give s an indication of the distance to the cabling fault. Inter-\nnal circuitry displays the TDR information in a user-readable digital format.\nCable diagnostics are only valid for copper connec tions and do not support fiber optic operation.\n3.1.12.1 Access\nLinkMD is initiated by accessing the PHY special control/stat us registers {26, 42} and the LinkMD result registers {27,\n43} for ports 1 and 2 respectively; and in conjunction with the port registers control 13 for ports 1 and 2 respectively to\ndisable Auto MDI/MDIX.\nAlternatively, the MIIM PHY registers 0 and 29 can be used for LinkMD access.\n3.1.12.2 Usage\nThe following is a sample procedure for using LinkMD with registers {42,43,45} on port 2.\n1. Disable auto MDI/MDI-X by writing a ‘1 ’ to register 45, bit [2] to enable ma nual control over the differential pair\nused to transmit the LinkMD pulse.START AUTO-NEGOTIATION\nFORCE LINK SETTING\nLISTEN FOR 10BASE-T \nLINK PULSESLISTEN FOR 100BASE-TX\nIDLESATTEMPT AUTO-\nNEGOTIATION\nLINK MODE SETBYPASS AUTO- NEGOTIATION\nAND SET LINK MODE\nLINK MODE SET?PARALLEL\nOPERATION NO\nYES\nYESNO\nJOIN FLOW\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS00002348A-page 17KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\n2. Start cable diagnostic test by writing a ‘1’ to regi ster 42, bit [4]. This enable bit is self-clearing.\n3. Wait (poll) for register 42, bit [4] to return a ‘0’, indicating cable diagnostic test is complete.\n4. Read cable diagnostic test results in register 42, bits [6:5]. The results are as follows:\n00 = normal condition (valid test)01 = open condition detected in cable (valid test)10 = short condition detected in cable (valid test)11 = cable diagnostic test failed (invalid test)\nThe ‘11’ case, invalid test, occurs when the KSZ8873MLL/FL L/RLL is unable to shut down the link partner. In this\ninstance, the test is not run, because it would be imposs ible for the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL to determine if the detected\nsignal is a reflection of the signal gener ated or a signal from another source.\n5. Get distance to fault by concatenating r egister 42, bit [0] and register 43, bi ts [7:0]; and multiplying the result by\na constant of 0.4. The distance to the cable fault can be determined by the following formula:\nEQUATION 3-1:\nConcatenated values of registers 42 and 43 are converted to decimal before multiplying by 0.4.\nThe constant (0.4) may be calibrated for different cabling co nditions, including cables with a velocity of propagation that\nvaries significantly from the norm.\n3.2 Power Management\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL supports enhanced  power management features in low power state with energy detection\nto ensure low-power dissipation during device idle period s. There are five operation modes under the power manage-\nment function, which is controlled by two bits in Register  195 (0xC3) and one bit in Register 29 (0x1D), 45 (0x2D) as\nshown below:\nRegister 195 bit[1:0] = 00 Normal Operation ModeRegister 195 bit[1:0] = 01 Energy Detect ModeRegister 195 bit[1:0] = 10 Soft Power Down ModeRegister 195 bit[1:0] = 11 Power Saving ModeRegister 29, 45 bit 3 = 1 Port Based Power Down ModeTable 3-3  indicates all internal function blocks status under four different power management operation modes.\n3.2.1 NORMAL OPERATION MODE\nThis is the default setting bit[1:0]=00 in register 195 after the chip power-up or hardware reset. When KSZ8873MLL/\nFLL/RLL is in this normal operation mode, al l PLL clocks are running, PHY and MA C are on, and the host interface is\nready for CPU read or write.

When KSZ887 3MLL/FLL/RLL is in this mode, all PLL cl ocks are enabled, MAC is on, all inter-\nnal registers values will not change, and hos t interface is ready for CPU read or wr ite. In this mode, it mainly controls\nthe PHY transceiver on or off based on line status to achieve power saving. The PHY remains transmitting and only\nturns off the unused receiver block. Once  activity resumes due to plugging a cabl e or attempting by the far end to estab-\nlish link, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL can automatically enabled the PHY power up to normal power state from power\nsaving mode.\nDuring this power saving mode, the host CPU can set bit[1:0] =0 in register 195 to transit the current power saving mode\nto any one of the other three power management operation modes.\n3.2.3 ENERGY DETECT MODE\nThe energy detect mode provides a mechanism to save more power than in the normal operation mode when the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL is not connected to an active link partner. In this mode, the device will save up to 50% of the\npower. If the cable is not plugged, th e KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL can automatically enter a low-power state, the energy\ndetect mode. In this mode, KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL will keep tr ansmitting 120 ns width pulses at a rate of 1 pulse/second.\nOnce activity resumes due to plugging a cable or an atte mpt by the far end to establish link, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\ncan automatically power up to normal  power state in energy detect mode.\nEnergy detect mode consists of two states, normal power st ate and low power state. While in low power state, the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL reduces power consumption by disabling a ll circuitry except the energy detect circuitry of the\nreceiver. The energy detect mode is entered by setting bit[1:0]=01 in register 195. When the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL is\nin this mode, it will monitor the cable energy. If there is no energy on the cabl e for a time longer than pre-configured\nvalue at bit[7:0] Go-Sleep time in register 196, KSZ 8873MLL/FLL/RLL will go into a low power state. When\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL is in low power state, it will keep moni toring the cable energy. Once the energy is detected from\nthe cable, KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL will ente r normal power state. When KSZ8873MLL/ FLL/RLL is at normal power state,\nit is able to transmit or receive packet from the cable.\nIt will save about 87% of the power when MII interface is in PHY mode, Pin SMTXER3/MII_LINK_3 is connected to High,\nregister 195 bit [1:0] =01, bit 2 =1 (Disable PLL), no cables are connected.\n3.2.4 SOFT POWER DOWN MODE\nThe soft power down mode is entered by setting bit[1:0]= 10 in register 195. When KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL is in this\nmode, all PLL clocks are disabled, the PHY and the MAC are of f, all internal registers values will not change. When the\nhost set bit[1:0]=00 in register 195, this device will be ba ck from current soft power down mode to normal operation\nmode.\n3.2.5 PORT-BASED POWER DOWN MODE\nIn addition, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL features a per-port po wer down mode. To save power, a PHY port that is not in\nuse can be powered down via port control register 29 or 45 bit 3, or MIIM PHY register. It saves about 15 mA per port.\n3.2.6 HARDWARE POWER DOWN\nKSZ8873 supports a hardware power down mode. When the pi n PWRDN is activated low, the entire chip is powered\ndown.\n3.3 MAC and Switch\n3.3.1 ADDRESS LOOKUP\nThe internal lookup table stores MAC addresses and their asso ciated information. It contains a 1K unicast address table\nplus switching information. \nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL is guaranteed to learn 1K addresses and distin guishes itself from hash-based lookup\ntables, which depending on the operating environment a nd probabilities, may not guar antee the absolute number of\naddresses it can learn.\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS00002348A-page 19KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\n3.3.2 LEARNING\nThe internal lookup engine updates its table with a new entry if the following conditions are met: \n• The received packet\'s source address (SA) does not exist in the lookup table.\n• The received packet is good; the packet has no receiving errors, and is of legal length.\nThe lookup engine inserts the qualified SA into the table, al ong with the port number and time stamp. If the table is full,\nthe last entry of the table is deleted to make room for the new entry.\n3.3.3 MIGRATION\nThe internal lookup engine also monitors whether a station has moved. If a station has moved, it will update the table\naccordingly. Migration happens when the following conditions are met:\n• The received packet’s SA is in the table, but th e associated source port information is different.\n• The received packet is good; the packet has no receiving errors, and is of legal length.\nThe lookup engine will update the existing record in the table with the new source port information.\n3.3.4 AGING\nThe lookup engine updates the time stamp information of a record whenever the corresponding SA appears. The time\nstamp is used in the aging process. If a record is not updat ed for a period of time, the lookup engine removes the record\nfrom the table. The lookup engine constantly performs t he aging process and will continuously remove aging records.\nThe aging period is about 200 seconds. Th is feature can be enabled or disabled  through register 3 (0x03) bit [2].\n3.3.5 FORWARDING\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL forwards packets using the algor ithm that is depicted in  the following flowcharts. Figure 3-\n4 shows stage one of the forwarding algorithm where the sear ch engine looks up the VLAN ID, static table, and dynamic\ntable for the destination address, and come s up with “port to forward 1” (PTF1). PTF1 is then further modified by span-\nning tree, IGMP snooping, port mirroring, and port VLAN pr ocesses to come up with “port to forward 2” (PTF2), as\nshown in Figure 3-5 . The packet is sent to PTF2.\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 20  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.FIGURE 3-4: DESTINATION ADDRESS LOOKUP FLOW CHART, STAGE 1\n \nStart\nVLAN ID\nValid?PTF1= NULL\nSearch Static\nTableSearch complete.\nGet PTF1 from\nStatic MAC Table\nDynamic Table\nSearch\nSearch complete.\nGet PTF1 from\nVLAN TableSearch complete.\nGet PTF1 from\nDynamic MAC\nTable\nPTF1- Search VLAN table\n- Ingress VLAN filtering\n- Discard NPVID check\nYESNO\nFOUND\nNOT\nFOUND\nFOUND\nNOT\nFOUNDThis search is based on\nDA or DA+FID\nThis search is based on\nDA+FID\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS00002348A-page 21KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL will not forward the following packets:\n1. Error packets: These include framing errors, Frame Check Sequence (FCS) errors, alignment errors, and illegal\nsize packet errors.\n2. IEEE802.3x PAUSE frames: KSZ8873MLL /FLL/RLL intercepts these packets and  performs full-du plex flow con-\ntrol accordingly.\n3. "Local" packets: Based on destination address (DA) look up. If the destination port fr om the lookup table matches\nthe port from which the packet origi nated, the packet is defined as local.\n3.3.6 SWITCHING ENGINE\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL features a high- performance switching engine to move data to and from the MAC’s packet\nbuffers. It operates in store and forward mode, while the efficient switching mechanism reduces overall latency. \nThe switching engine has a 32 kb internal frame buffer. This  buffer pool is shared between all three ports. There are a\ntotal of 256 buffers available. Each buffer is sized at 128 bytes.\n3.3.7 MAC OPERATION\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL strictly abides by IEEE  802.3 standards to maximize compatibility.\n3.3.7.1 Inter Packet Gap (IPG)\nIf a frame is successfully transmitted, the 96 bits time  IPG is measured between the two consecutive MTXEN. If the\ncurrent packet is experiencing collision, the 96 bits time IPG is measured from  MCRS and the next MTXEN.\n3.3.7.2 Back-Off Algorithm\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL implem ents the IEEE 802.3 standard for the bina ry exponential back-off algorithm, and\noptional "aggressive mode" back-off. After 16 collisions, the packet is optionally dropped depending on the switch con-\nfiguration for register 4 (0x04) bit [3].FIGURE 3-5: DESTINATION ADDRESS RESOLUTION FLOW CHART, STAGE 2\n \nSpanning Tree\nProcessPTF1\nIGMP Process\nPort Mirror\nProcess\nPort VLAN\nMembership\nCheck\nPTF2- Check receiving port\'s receive enable bit\n- Check destination port\'s transmit enable bit\n- Check whether packets are special (BPDU\n   or specified)\n- RX Mirror\n- TX Mirror- RX or TX Mirror- RX and TX Mirror- Applied to MAC #1 and MAC #2\n- MAC #3 is reserved for\n   microprocessor\n- IGMP will be forwarded to port 3\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 22  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.3.3.7.3 Late Collision\nIf a transmit packet experiences collisions after 512 bit times of the transmission, the packet is dropped.\n3.3.7.4 Illegal Frames\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL discards frames less than 64 bytes and can be programmed to accept frames up to1518\nbytes, 1536 bytes, or 1916 bytes. These maximum frame si ze settings are programmed in register 4 (0x04). Because\nthe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL supports VLAN tags, the maximu m sizing is adjusted wh en these tags are present.\n3.3.7.5 Full-Duplex Flow Control\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL suppor ts standard IEEE 802.3x flow control fram es on both transmit and receive sides.\nOn the receive side, if the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL receives  a pause control frame, th e KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL will not\ntransmit the next normal frame until the timer, specified in  the pause control frame, expires. If another pause frame is\nreceived before the current timer expire s, the timer will be updated with the new va lue in the second pause frame. During\nthis period (while it is flow controlled), only flow control packets from the KSZ887 3MLL/FLL/RLL are transmitted.\nOn the transmit side, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL has intelligent and efficient ways to determine when to invoke flow con-\ntrol. The flow control is based on availa bility of the system resources, includi ng available buffers, available transmit\nqueues, and available receive queues.\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL will flow control a port that has just received a packet if the destination port resource is busy.\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL issues a flow co ntrol frame (XOFF), containing the maximum pause time defined by the\nIEEE 802.3x standard. Once the resource is freed up, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL sends out th e other flow control frame\n(XON) with zero pause time to turn off the flow control (turn on transmission to the port). A hysteresis feature is provided\nto prevent the flow control mechanism from being constantly activated and deactivated. \nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL flow controls all ports if the receive queue becomes full.\n3.3.7.6 Half-Duplex Backpressure\nA half-duplex backpressure option (not in  IEEE 802.3 standards) is also provided. The activa tion and deact ivation con-\nditions are the same as full-duplex flow control. If ba ckpressure is required, the KSZ 8873MLL/FLL/RLL sends pream-\nbles to defer the other stations\' tr ansmission (carrier sense deference).\nTo avoid jabber and excessive deference (as defined in the 802.3 standard), after a certain time, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/\nRLL discontinues the carrier sense and then  raises it again quickly. This short s ilent time (no carrier sense) prevents\nother stations from sending out packets thus keeping other st ations in a carrier sense defe rred state. If the port has pack-\nets to send during a backpressure situation, the carrier sense type backpressure is interrupted and those packets are\ntransmitted instead. If there are no additional packets to send , carrier sense type backpressure is reactivated again until\nswitch resources free up. If a collision occurs, the binary exponential back-off algorithm is skipped and carrier sense is\ngenerated immediately, thus reducing the c hance of further collisions and carrier sense is maintained to prevent packet\nreception.\nTo ensure no packet loss in 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX half-d uplex modes, the user must enable the following:\n• Aggressive back-off (register 3 (0x03), bit [0])\n• No excessive collision drop (register 4 (0x04), bit [3])\nNote that these bits are not set as defa ults because this is not the IEEE standard.\n3.3.7.7 Broadcast Storm Protection\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL has an intelligen t option to protect the switch system  from receiving too many broadcast\npackets. As the broadcast packets are forwarded to all po rts except the source port, an excessive number of switch\nresources (bandwidth and available space in transmit queues) may be utilized. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL has the\noption to include “multicast packets” for storm control. The broadcast storm rate parameters are programmed globally,\nand can be enabled or disabled on a per port basis. The rate is based on a 67 ms interval for 100BT and a 500 ms\ninterval for 10BT. At the beginning of each interval, the counter is cleared to zero, and the rate limit mechanism starts\nto count the number of bytes during the interval. The rate defi nition is described in register 6 (0x06) and 7 (0x07). The\ndefault setting is 0x63 (99 decimal). This is equal to a rate of 1%, calculated as follows:\n148,800 frames/sec × 67 ms/interval × 1% = 99 frames/interval (approx.) = 0x63\nNote: 148,800 frames/sec is based on 64-byte block of packets in 100BASE-TX  with 12 bytes of IPG and 8 bytes of\npreamble between two packets.\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS00002348A-page 23KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\n3.3.7.8 Port Individual MAC Address and Source Port Filtering\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL provide individual MAC address for port 1 and port 2 respectively. They can be set at reg-\nister 142-147 and 148-153. With this featur e, the CPU connected to the port 3 can receive the packets from two internet\nsubnets which has their own MAC address.\nThe packet will be filtered if its source address matches th e MAC address of port 1 or port 2 when the register 21 and\n37 bit 6 is set to 1 respectively. For ex ample, the packet will be dropped after it completes the loop of a ring network.\n3.3.8 MII INTERFACE OPERATION\nThe Media Independent Interface (MII) is  specified in Clause 22 of the IEEE 802 .3u Standard. It provides a common\ninterface between physical layer and MAC layer devices. The MII provided by the KSZ8873MLL/FLL is connected to\nthe device’s third MAC. The interface contains two distinct  groups of signals: one for transmission and the other for\nreception. Table 3-4  describes the signals used by the MII bus.\nThe MII operates in either PHY mode or MAC mode. The data interface is a nibble wide and runs at ¼ the network bit\nrate (not encoded). Additional signals on the transmit side indicate when data is valid or when an error occurs duringtransmission. Similarly, the receive side has signals that convey when the data is valid and without physical layer errors.\nFor half-duplex operation,  the SCOL signal indicates if a collision has occurred during transmission.\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL does not provide the MRXER signal for PHY mode operation and the MTXER signal for MAC\nmode operation. Normally, MRXER indicates a receive error coming from the physical layer device and MTXER indi-cates a transmit error from the MAC devi ce. Because the switch filters error fram es, these MII error signals are not used\nby the KSZ8873MLL/FLL. So, for PHY mode operation, if the device interf acing with the KSZ8873MLL/FLL has an\nMRXER input pin, it needs to be tied low. And, for MAC m ode operation, if the device in terfacing with the KSZ8873MLL/\nFLL has an MTXER input pin, it also needs to be tied low.\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL provides a bypass feature in the MI I PHY mode. Pin SMTXER3/MII_LINK is used for MII link\nstatus. If the host is power down, pin MII_LINK will go to high . In this case, no new ingress frames from port1 or port 2\nwill be sent out through port 3, and the frames for po rt 3 already in packet memory will be flushed out.\n3.3.9 RMII INTERF ACE OPERATION\nThe Reduced Media Independent Interfac e (RMII) specifies a low pin count Media Independent Interface (MII). RMII\nprovides a common interface between physical layer and MAC layer devices, and has the following key characteristics:\n• Ports 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps data rates.TABLE 3-4: MII SIGNALS\nPHY Mode Connections\nPin DescriptionMAC Mode Connections\nExternal MAC\nController SignalsKSZ8873MLL/FLL\nPHY SignalsExternal PHY \nSignalsKSZ8873MLL/FLL\nMAC Signals\nMTXEN SMTXEN3 Transmit Enable MTXEN SMRXDV3\nMTXER SMTXER3 Transmit Error MTXER (NOT USED)\nMTXD3 SMTXD33 Transmit Data Bit 3 MTXD3 SMRXD33\nMTXD2 SMTXD32 Transmit Data Bit 2 MTXD2 SMRXD32\nMTXD1 SMTXD31 Transmit Data Bit 1 MTXD1 SMRXD31MTXD0 SMTXD30 Transmit Data Bit 0 MTXD0 SMRXD30\nMTXC SMTXC3 Transmit Clock MTXC SMRXC3\nMCOL SCOL3 Collision Detection MCOL SCOL3\nMCRS SCRS3 Carrier Sense MCRS SCRS3\nMRXDV SMRXDV3 Receive Data Valid MRXDV SMTXEN3\nMRXER (NOT USED) Receive  Error MRXER SMTXER3\nMRXD3 SMRXD33 Receive Data Bit 3 MRXD3 SMTXD33\nMRXD2 SMRXD32 Receive Data Bit 2 MRXD2 SMTXD32\nMRXD1 SMRXD31 Receive Data Bit 1 MRXD1 SMTXD31MRXD0 SMRXD30 Receive Data Bit 0 MRXD0 SMTXD30\nMRXC SMRXC3 Receive Clock MRXC SMTXC3\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 24  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.• Uses a single 50 MHz clock reference (provided internally or externally).\n• Provides independent 2-bit wide (di-bit) transmit and receive data paths.\n• Contains two distinct groups of signals: o ne for transmission and the other for reception\nWhen EN_REFCLKO_3 is high, KSZ8873RLL will output a 50 MH z in REFCLKO_3.

To detect error frames\nfrom RMII PHY devices, the SMTXER3 input  signal of the KSZ8873RLL is connected to the RXER output signal of the\nRMII PHY device.\nCollision detection is implemented in accordance with the RMII Specification.\nIn RMII mode, tie MII signals SMTXD3[3:2] and SMTXER3 to ground if they are not used.The KSZ8873RLL RMII can interface with RMII PHY and RMII MAC devices. The latter allows two KSZ8873RLL\ndevices to be connected back-to-back. Table 3-7  shows the KSZ8873RLL RMII pin connections with an external RMII\nPHY and an external RMII MAC, such as another KSZ8873RLL device.\n3.3.10 MII MANAGEMENT  (MIIM) INTERFACE\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL supports the IEEE 802.3 MII Managem ent Interface, also known as the Management Data\nInput/Output (MDIO) Interface. This inte rface allows upper-layer devices to monitor and control the states of the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL. An external device with MDC/MDIO capab ility is used to read the PH Y status or configure the\nPHY settings. Further detail on the MIIM interface is found in Clause 22.2.4.5 of the IEEE 802.3u Specification and refer\nto 802.3 section 22.3.4 for the timing.\nThe MIIM interface consists of the following:• A physical connection that incorporates the da ta line (SDA_MDIO) and the clock line (SCL_MDC).\n• A specific protocol that o perates across the aforementioned physical c onnection that allows an external controller \nto communicate with the KS Z8873MLL/FLL/RLL device.\n• Access to a set of eight 16-bit registers,  consisting of six standard MIIM regi sters [0:5] and two custom MIIM regis-\nters [29, 31].\nThe MIIM Interface can operate up to a maximum clock speed of 5 MHz.Table 3-8  depicts the MII Management Interface frame format.TXD0 Input Output Transmit data bit 0 SMTXD30 (input)\nRX_ER Output Input (not requi red) Receive error (not used)\n————SMTXER3 (input)\nConnects to RX_ER \nsignal of RMII PHY \ndevice\nTABLE 3-7: RMII SIGNAL CONNECTIONS\nKSZ8873RLL\nPHY-MAC Connections\nPin DescriptionsKSZ8873RLL\nMAC-MAC Connections\nExternal PHY \nSignalsKSZ8873RLL MAC \nSignalsKSZ8873RLL MAC \nSignalsExternal MAC \nSignals\nREF_CLK REFCLKI_3 Reference Clock REFCLKI_3 REF_CLK\nTX_EN SMRXDV3Carrier sense/\nReceive data validSMRXDV3 CRS_DV\nTXD1 SMRXD31 Receive data bit 1 SMRXD31 RXD1\nTXD0 SMRXD30 Receive data bit 0 SMRXD30 RXD0\nCRS_DV SMTXEN3 Transmit enable SMTXEN3 TX_EN\nRXD1 SMTXD31 Transmit data bit 1 SMTXD31 TXD1RXD0 SMTXD30 Transmit data bit 0 SMTXD30 TXD0\nRX_ER SMTXER3 Receive error (not used) (not used)TABLE 3-6: RMII SIGNAL DESCRIPTION (CONTINUED)\nRMII Signal NameDirection (with \nrespect to PHY)Direction (with \nrespect to MAC)RMII Signal \nDescriptionKSZ8873RLL RMII \nSignal Direction\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 26  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.3.3.11 SERIAL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE (SMI)\nThe SMI is the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL non-standard MIIM inte rface that provides access to all KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nconfiguration registers. This interface allows an external device to comple tely monitor and control the states of the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL.\nThe SMI interface consists of the following:• A physical connection that incorporates the da ta line (SDA_MDIO) and the clock line (SCL_MDC).\n• A specific protocol that o perates across the aforementioned physical c onnection that allows an external controller \nto communicate with the KS Z8873MLL/FLL/RLL device.\n• Access to all KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL configuration regist ers. Register access includes the Global, Port and \nAdvanced Control Registers 0-198 (0x00 – 0xC6), and i ndirect access to the standard MIIM registers [0:5] and \ncustom MIIM regi sters [29, 31].\nTable 3-9  depicts the SMI frame format.\nSMI register read access is selected when OP Code is set to “00” and bit 4 of the PHY address is set to ‘1’. SMI register\nwrite access is selected when OP Code is set to “00” and bit 4 of the PHY address is set to ‘0’. PHY address bit[3] is\nundefined for SMI register access, and hence can be se t to either ‘0’ or ‘1’ in read/write operations.\nTo access the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL registers 0- 196 (0x00 – 0xC6), the following applies:\n• PHYAD[2:0] and REGAD[4:0] are concat enated to form the 8-bit address; t hat is, {PHYAD[2:0], REGAD[4:0]} = \nbits [7:0] of the 8-bit address.\n• TA bits [1:0] are ‘Z0’ means the processor MDIO pin is changed to input Hi-Z from output mode and the followed \n‘0’ is the read response from device.\n• TA bits [1:0] are set to ‘10’ when write registers.• Registers are 8 data bits wide.\n- For read operation, data bits [15:8] are read back as 0’s. \n- For write operation, data bits [15:8] are not def ined, and hence can be set to either ‘0’ or ‘1’.\nSMI register access is the same as t he MIIM register access, except for the register access requirements presented in\nthis section.\n3.4 Advanced Switch Functions\n3.4.1 BYPASS MODE\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL also offers a bypass mode that enables system-level power saving. When the CPU (con-\nnected to Port 3) enters a power saving  mode of power down or sleeping mode, the CPU can control pin 27 SMTXER3/\nMII_LINK_3, which can be tied high so that the KSZ8873M LL/FLL/RLL detects this change  and automatically switches\nto the bypass mode. In this mode, the s witch function between Port 1 and Port  2 is sustained. The packets with DA to\nPort 3 will be dropped and will bypass the internal buffer memo ry, making the buffer memory more efficient for the data\ntransfer between Port 1 and Port 2.TABLE 3-8: MII MANAG EMENT FRAME FORMAT\nPreambleStart of \nFrameRead/\nWrite OP \nCodePHY \nAddress \nBits[4:0]REG \nAddress \nBits[4:0]TA Data Bits[15:0] Idle\nRead 32 1’s 01 10 AAAAA RRRRR Z0 DDDDDDDD_DDDDDDDD Z\nWrite 32 1’s 01 01 AAAAA RRRRR 10 DDDDDDDD_DDDDDDDD Z\nTABLE 3-9: SERIAL MANAGEMENT INTERFACE (SMI) FRAME FORMAT\nPreambleStart of \nFrameRead/\nWrite OP \nCodePHY \nAddress \nBits[4:0]REG \nAddress \nBits[4:0]TA Data Bits[15:0] Idle\nRead 32 1’s 01 00 1xRRR RRRRR Z0 0000_0000_DDDD_DDDD Z\nWrite 32 1’s 01 00 0xRRR RRRRR 10 xxxx_xxxx_DDDD_DDDD Z\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL provides  a 16-entries VLAN table that converts the 12-bits VLAN ID (VID) to the\n4-bits Filter ID (FID) for address lookup. If a non-tagged or  null-VID-tagged packet is received, the ingress port default\nVID is used for lookup. In VLAN mode, the lookup process starts with VLAN table lookup to determine whether the VID\nis valid. If the VID is not valid, the packet is dropped and its address is not learned. If the VID is valid, the FID is retrie ved\nfor further lookup. The FID + Destination Address (FID+D A) are used to determine t he destination port. The FID +\nSource Address (FID+SA) are used for address learning.\nAdvanced VLAN features, such as “Ing ress VLAN filtering” and “Discard Non PVID packets” are also supported by the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL. These features can be set on a per port basis, and are defined in registers 18, 34, and 50 for\nports 1, 2 and 3, respectively.\n3.4.3 QOS PRIORITY SUPPORT\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL provides Quality of Service (QoS) for applications su ch as VoIP and video conferencing.\nOffering four priority queues per port, the per-port transmit queue can be split into four priority queues: Queue 3 is the\nhighest priority queue and Queue 0 is the lowest priority queue. Bit [0] of regist ers 16, 32, and 48 is used to enable split\ntransmit queues for ports 1, 2, and 3, respectively. If a port\'s transmit queue is not split, high priority and low priority\npackets have equal priority in the transmit queue. \nThere is an additional option to either always deliver high pr iority packets first or use weighted fair queuing for the four\npriority queues. This global option is set and explained in bit [3] of register 5.\n3.4.4 PORT-BASED PRIORITY\nWith port-based priority, each ingress port is individually cla ssified as a high priority receiving port. All packets received\nat the high priority receiving port are marked as high priority  and are sent to the high-priority transmit queue if the cor-\nresponding transmit queue is split. Bits [4:3] of registers 16, 32, and 48 are used to enable port-based priority for ports\n1, 2, and 3, respectively.TABLE 3-10: FID+DA LOOKUP IN VLAN MODE\nDA Found in \nStatic MAC \nTable?Use FID \nFlag?FID Match?FID+DA Found in \nDynamic MAC \nTable?Action\nNo Don’t care Don’t care NoBroadcast to the membership ports \ndefined in the VLAN Table bits [18:16]\nNo Don’t care Don’t care YesSend to the destination port defined in \nthe Dynamic MAC Address Table bits \n[53:52] \nYes 0 Don’t care Don’t careSend to the destination port(s) defined \nin the Static MAC Address Table bits \n[50:48]\nYes 1 No NoBroadcast to the membership ports \ndefined in the VLAN Table bits [18:16]\nYes 1 No YesSend to the destination port defined in \nthe Dynamic MAC Address Table bits \n[53:52] \nYes 1 Yes Don’t careSend to the destination port(s) defined \nin the Static MAC Address Table bits \n[50:48]\nTABLE 3-11: FID+SA LOOKUP IN VLAN MODE\nFID+SA Found in Dynamic MAC Table?

If tagged, the 3-bit priori ty field in the VLAN tag is retrieved and compared against the “priority mapping”\nvalue, as specified by the registers 12 and 13 . The “priority mapping” value is programmable.\nFigure 3-6  illustrates how the 802.1p priority field is embedded in the 802.1Q VLAN tag.\n802.1p-based priority is enabled by bit [5] of registers 16, 32, and 48 for ports 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL provides the option to insert or re move the priority tagged frame\'s header at each individual\negress port. This header, consisting of the 2 bytes VLAN Prot ocol ID (VPID) and the 2-byte Tag Control Information field\n(TCI), is also referred to as the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag.\nTag Insertion is enabled by bit [2] of t he port registers control 0 and the register  194 to select which source port (ingress\nport) PVID can be inserted on the egress port for ports 1, 2,  and 3, respectively. At the egress port, untagged packets\nare tagged with the ingress port’s default tag. The default t ags are programmed in register  sets {19,20}, {35,36}, and\n{51,52} for ports 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and the source por t VID has to be inserted at selected egress ports by bit[5:0]\nof register 194. The KSZ887 3MLL/FLL/RLL will not add tags to already tagged packets.\nTag Removal is enabled by bit [1] of registers 16, 32, and 48 for ports 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At the egress port, tagged\npackets will have their 802.1Q VLAN Tags removed. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL will not modify untagged packets.\nThe CRC is recalculated for both tag insertion and tag removal.802.1p Priority Field Re-mapping is a QoS feature that al lows the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL to set the “User Priority Ceil-\ning” at any ingress port. If the ingress packet’s priority fiel d has a higher priority value than the default tag’s priority fi eld\nof the ingress port, the packet’s priority field is  replaced with the default tag’s priority field.\n3.4.6 DIFFSERV-BASED PRIORITY\nDiffServ-based priority uses the ToS registers (registers 96 to  111) in the Advanced Contro l Registers section. The ToS\npriority control registers implement a fully decoded, 64-bit Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) register to deter-\nmine packet priority from the 6-bit ToS field in the IP header. When the most significant 6 bi ts of the ToS field are fully\ndecoded, the resultant of the 64 possibiliti es is compared with the corresponding bits in the DSCP register to determine\npriority.\n3.5 Spanning Tree Support\nTo support spanning tree, port 3 is designated as the processor port.\nThe other ports (port 1 and port 2) can be configured in one of the five spanning tree states via “transmit enable”, “receive\nenable” and “learning disable” register sett ings in registers 18 and 34 for ports 1 and 2, respectively. The following table\nshows the port setting and software actions tak en for each of the five spanning tree states.FIGURE 3-6: 802.1P PRIORITY FIELD FORMAT\nPreamble DA TCI86 6 2\nlength LLC Data FCS2 46-1500 4\n1\nTagged Packet Type\n(8100 for Ethernet)802.1p\nCFIVLAN IDBytes\nBits 16 3 12\n802.1q VLAN Tag2\nSA VPID\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

DS00002348A-page 31KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\n3.8 IGMP Support\nFor Internet Group Management Protocol  (IGMP) support in layer 2, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL provides two compo-\nnents: IGMP snooping and IGMP send-back to the subscribed port.\n3.8.1 IGMP SNOOPING\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL traps IGMP packets and forwards th em only to the processor (port 3). The IGMP packets\nare identified as IP packets (either Ethernet IP packets, or IEEE 802.3 SNAP IP packets) with IP version = 0x4 and pro-\ntocol version number = 0x2.\n3.8.2 IGMP SEND-BACK TO  THE SUBSCRIBED PORT\nOnce the host responds the received IGMP packet, the host should know the original IGMP ingress port and send back\nthe IGMP packet to this port only, otherwise this IGMP packet will be broadcasted to all ports to downgrade the perfor-\nmance.\nEnable the tail tag mode, the host will know the IGMP packet received port from tail tag bits [0] and can send back the\nresponse IGMP packet to this subscribed port by setting the bits [1,0] in the tail tag. Enable “Tail tag mode” by setting\nRegister 3 bit 6. The tail tag will be removed automatically when the IGMP packet is sent ou t from the subscribed port.\n3.9 Port Mirroring Support\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL supports “Port Mirroring” comprehensively as:\n• “Receive only” mirror on a port \n- All the packets received on the port are mirrored on the sn iffer port. For example, po rt 1 is programmed to be \n“receive sniff” and port 3 is programmed to be the “sniffer  port”. A packet received on port 1 is destined to port \n2 after the internal lookup. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL fo rwards the packet to both port 2 and port 3. The \nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL can optionally even forward “bad” received packets to the “sniffer port”.\n• “Transmit only” mirror on a port\n- All the packets transmitted on the port are mirrored on t he sniffer port. For example, port 1 is programmed to \nbe “transmit sniff” and port 3 is programmed to be the “sniff er port”. A packet received on port 2 is destined to \nport 1 after the internal lookup. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/ RLL forwards the packet to both port 1 and port 3.\n• “Receive and transmit” mirror on two ports\n- All the packets received on port A and transmitted on port B are mirrored on the sniffer port. To turn on the \n“AND” feature, set register 5 bit [0] to ‘1’. For exampl e, port 1 is programmed to be “receive sniff”, port 2 is \nprogrammed to be “transmit sniff”, and port 3 is programmed  to be the “sniffer port”. A packet received on port \n1 is destined to port 2 after the internal lookup. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL forwards the packet to both port 2 \nand port 3.\nMultiple ports can be selected as “receive sniff” or “transmit sniff”. In addition, any port can be selected as the “sniffer\nport”. All these per port featur es can be selected through registers 17, 33, and 49 for ports 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n3.10 Rate Limiting Support\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL provides a fine resolution hardware rate limiting from 64 kbps to 99 Mbps. The rate step is\n64 kbps when the rate range is from 64 kbps to 960 kbps and 1 Mbps for 1 Mbps to 100 Mbps (100BT) or to 10 Mbps(10BT) (refer to Data Rate Limit Table). The rate limit is independently on the “receive side” and on the “transmit side”\non a per port basis. For 10BASE-T, a rate setting above 10 Mbps means the rate is  not limited. On the receive side, the\ndata receive rate for each priority at each port can be limite d by setting up Ingress Rate Co ntrol Registers. On the trans-\nmit side, the data transmit rate for each priority queue at  each port can be limited by setting up Egress Rate Control\nRegisters. The size of each frame has options to include mi nimum IFG (Inter Frame Gap) or Preamble byte, in addition\nto the data field (from packet DA to FCS).\nFor ingress rate limiting, KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL provides options  to selectively choose frames from all types, multicast,\nbroadcast, and flooded unicast frames. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL counts the data  rate from those selected type of\nframes. Packets are dropped at the ingress port wh en the data rate exceeds the specified rate limit.\nFor egress rate limiting, the Leaky Bucket algorithm is applied to each output prio rity queue for shaping output traffic.\nInter frame gap is stretched on a per frame base to generat e smooth, non-burst egress traffic. The throughput of each\noutput priority queue is limited by the egress rate specified.\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 32  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.If any egress queue receives more traffic than the specified egress rate throughput, packets may be accumulated in the\noutput queue and packet memory. After the memory of the q ueue or the port is used up, packet dropping or flow control\nwill be triggered. As a result of conges tion, the actual egress rate may be domin ated by flow control/dropping at the\ningress end, and may be therefore slight ly less than the specified egress rate. \nTo reduce congestion, it is a good practice to make sure the egress bandwidth exceeds the ingress bandwidth.\n3.11 Unicast MAC Address Filtering\nThe unicast MAC address filtering function works in conjunction with the static MAC address table. First, the static MAC\naddress table is used to assign a dedicated MAC address to a specific port. If a unicast MAC address is not recorded\nin the static table, it is also not learned in the dynam ic MAC table. The KSZ8873MLL/FL L/RLL is then configured with\nthe option to either filter or forward unicast packets for an unknown MAC address. This option is enabled and configured\nin register 14.\nThis function is useful in preventing th e broadcast of unicast packe ts that could degrade the q uality of the port in appli-\ncations such as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).\n3.12 Configuration Interface\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL can o perate as both a managed switch  and an unmanaged switch.\nIn unmanaged mode, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/ RLL is typically programmed using an EEPROM. If no EEPROM is present,\nthe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL is configured us ing its default register settings. Some  default settings are configured via\nstrap-in pin options. The strap-in pins are indicat ed in the “Pin Description and I/O Assignment” table.\n3.12.1 I2C MASTER SERIAL BUS CONFIGURATION\nWith an additional I2C (“2-wire”) EEPROM, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL can perform more advanced sw itch features like\n“broadcast storm protec tion” and “rate control” without the need of an external processor.\nFor KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL I2C Master configuration, the EEPR OM stores the configuration da ta for register 0 to regis-\nter 120 (as defined in the KSZ8873MLL/F LL/RLL register map) with the exception of the “Re ad Only” status registers.\nAfter the de-assertion of reset, the KSZ 8873MLL/FLL/RLL sequentially reads in the configuration data for all control reg-\nisters, starting from register 0.\nThe following is a sample procedure for programming  the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/ RLL with a pre-configured EEPROM:\n1. Connect the KSZ8873 MLL/FLL/RLL to the EEPROM by joining th e SCL and SDA signal s of the respective\ndevices. \n2. Enable I2C master mode by setting the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/ RLL strap-in pins, P2LED[1:0] to “00”.\n3. Check to ensure that the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL reset signal  input, RSTN, is properly connected to the external\nreset source at the board level.\n4. Program the desired configuration data into the EEPROM.FIGURE 3-8: EEPROM CONFIG URATION TIMING DIAGRAM\n........\n....RST_N\nSCL\nSDA\ntprgm<15 ms\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS00002348A-page 33KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\n5. Place the EEPROM on the board and power up the board.\n6. Assert an active-low reset to the RSTN pin of th e KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL. After reset is de-asserted, the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL begins reading the confi guration data from the EEPR OM. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nchecks that the first byte read from the EEPROM is “88” . If this value is correct, EEPROM configuration contin-\nues. If not, EEPROM configuration acce ss is denied and all other data sent from the EEPROM is ignored by the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL.\nFor proper operation, ensure that th e KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL PWRDN input signal is  not asserted during the reset oper-\nation. The PWRDN input is active-low.\n3.12.2 I2C SLAVE SERIAL BUS CONFIGURATION\nIn managed mode, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/R LL can be configured as an I2C slave device. In this mode, an I2C master\ndevice (external controller/CPU) has co mplete programming access to the KSZ8 873MLL/FLL/RLL’s 198 registers. Pro-\ngramming access includes the Global Registers, Port Register s, Advanced Control Registers and indirect access to the\n“Static MAC Table”, “VLAN Table”, “Dynamic MAC Table,” an d “MIB Counters.” The tables and counters are indirectly\naccessed via registers 121 to 131.\nIn I2C slave mode, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL operates like other I2C slave devices. Addressing the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/\nRLL’s 8-bit registers is similar to addressing the Microchip AT24C02 EEPROM ’s memory locations. Details of I2C read/\nwrite operations and related timing informati on can be found in the AT24C02 data sheet.\nTwo fixed 8-bit device addresses are used to address the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL in I2C slave mode. One is for read;\nthe other is for write. Th e addresses are as follow:\n• 1011_1111   <read>\n• 1011_1110   <write>\nThe following is a sample procedure for pr ogramming the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL using the I2C slave serial bus:\n1. Enable I2C slave mode by setting the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL strap-in pins P2LED[1:0] to “01”.\n2. Power up the board and assert reset to the KSZ8873MLL/FL L/RLL. Configure the desired register settings in the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL, using the I2C write operation.\n3. Read back and verify the register settin gs in the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL, using the I2C read operation.\nSome of the configuration settings, such as “Aging En able”, “Auto Negotiation Enable”, “Force Speed” and “Power\ndown” can be programmed after the switch has been started.\n3.12.3 SPI SLAVE SERIAL BUS CONFIGURATION\nIn managed mode, the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RL L can be configured as a SPI slave device. In this mode, a SPI master\ndevice (external controller/CPU) has co mplete programming access to the KSZ8 873MLL/FLL/RLL’s 198 registers. Pro-\ngramming access includes the Global Registers, Port Regi sters, Advanced Control Registers, and indirect access to\nthe “Static MAC Table”, “VLAN Table”, “Dynamic MAC Table,” and “MIB Counters”. The tables and counters are indirectly\naccessed via registers 121 to 131.\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL supports two standard SPI comm ands: ‘0000_0011’ for data read and ‘0000_0010’ for data\nwrite. SPI multiple read and multiple write are also supported by  the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL to  expedite register read\nback and register configuration, respectively.\nSPI multiple read is initiated when the master device continues to drive t he KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL SPISN input pin (SPI\nSlave Select signal) low after a byte (a register) is r ead. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL intern al address counter increments\nautomatically to the next byte (next regi ster) after the read. The next byte at th e next register address is shifted out onto\nthe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL SPIQ output pin. SPI multiple read continues until th e SPI master device terminates it by de-\nasserting the SPISN signal to the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL.\nSimilarly, SPI multiple write is init iated when the master device continue s to drive the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL SPISN\ninput pin low after a byte (a register) is written. The KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL internal addr ess counter increments auto-\nmatically to the next byte (next register) after the write. Th e next byte that is sent from the master device to the\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL SDA input pin is written to the next r egister address. SPI multiple write continues until the SPI\nmaster device terminates it by de-asserti ng the SPISN signal to the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL.\nFor both SPI multiple read and multiple write, the KSZ8873ML L/FLL/RLL internal address counter wraps back to register\naddress zero once the highest register address is reached.  This feature allows all 198 KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL registers\nto be read, or written with a single SPI  command from any initial register address.\nThe KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL is capable of supporting an SPI bus.\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 34  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.The following is a sample procedure for progr amming the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL using the SPI bus:\n1. At the board level, connect the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL pins as follows:\n2. Enable SPI slave mode by setting the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL strap-in pins P2LED[1:0] to “10”.\n3. Power up the board and assert reset to the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL. \n4. Configure the desired register sett ings in the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL, using the SPI write or multiple write com-\nmand.\n5. Read back and verify the register settings in the KSZ 8873MLL/FLL/RLL, using the SPI  read or multiple read com-\nmand. \nSome of the configuration settings, such as “Aging Enable ,” “Auto Negotiation Enable,” “Force Speed,” and “Power\nDown” can be programmed after the switch has been started.\nThe following four figures illustr ate the SPI data cycles for “Write,” “Read,” “Multiple Write,” and “Multiple Read.” The\nread data is registered out of SPIQ on the falling edge of SPIC, and the data input on SPID  is registered on the rising\nedge of SPIC.TABLE 3-14: SPI CONNECTIONS\nPin Number Signal NameExternal Processor Signal \nDescription\n40 SPISN SPI Slave Select\n42 SCL (SPIC) SPI Clock43 SDA (SPID) SPI Data\n(Master output; Slave input)\n39 SPIQ SPI Data\n(Master input; Slave output)\nFIGURE 3-9: SPI WRITE DATA CYCLE\nSPIQSPIC\nSPIDSPIS_N\n00000010 X A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0\nWRITE COMMAND WRITE ADDRESS WRITE DATAD2 D0 D1 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

In loopback mode, the speed at\nboth PHY ports needs to be set to 100BASE-TX. Two types of loopback are supported: Far-end Loopback and Near-\nend (Remote) Loopback.\n3.13.1 FAR-END LOOPBACK\nFar-end loopback is conducted between the KSZ8873MLL/FLL/ RLL’s two PHY ports. The loopback is limited to few\npackage a time for diagnosis purpose and cannot support larg e traffic. The loopback path starts at the “Originating.”\nPHY port’s receive inputs (RXP/RXM), wraps around at the “loopback” PHY port’s PMD/PMA, and ends at the “Origi-\nnating” PHY port’s transmit outputs (TXP/TXM).\nBit [0] of registers 29 and 45 is used to enable far-end loopba ck for ports 1 and 2, respectively. Alternatively, the MII\nManagement register 0, bit [14] can be used to enable far-end loopback.\nThe far-end loopback path is illustrated in Figure 3-13 .FIGURE 3-12: SPI MULTIPLE READ\nSPIQSPIC\nSPIDSPIS_N\n00000011 X A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0\nD7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nREAD COMMAND READ ADDRESS Byte 1\nXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX X\nByte 2 Byte 3 Byte NX X X X X X X X\nXXXXXXXX\nD7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 SPIQSPIC\nSPIDSPIS_N\n\uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

The loop-\nback path starts at the PHY port’s receive inputs (RXPx /RXMx), wraps around at the same PHY port’s PMD/PMA, and\nends at the PHY port’s transmit outputs (TXPx/TXMx).\nBit [1] of registers 26 and 42 is used to enable near-end l oopback for ports 1 and 2, respectively. Alternatively, the MII\nManagement register 31, bit [1] can be used to enable near-end loopback.\nThe near-end loopback paths are illustrated in Figure 3-14 .FIGURE 3-13: FAR-END LOOPBACK PATH\nFIGURE 3-14: NEAR-END (REMOTE) LOOPBACK PATHPMD/PMAPCSMACSwitchMACPCSPMD/PMATXP /\nTXMRXP /\nRXMOriginating\nPHY Port\nLoop Back\nPHY Port\nTXP1/\nTXM1RXP1/\nRXM1\nRXP2/RXM2TXP2/\nTXM2PHY \nPort  1\nPHY\nPort 2 PMD/PMAPCSMACSwitchMAC\n PCSPMD/PMA\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 38  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.4.0 REGISTER DESCRIPTIONS\n4.1 MII Management (MIIM) Registers\nThe MIIM interface is used to access the MII PH Y registers defined in this section. The SPI, I2C, and SMI interfaces can\nalso be used to access some of these registers.

In response to a Destination Address (DA) look\nup, the KSZ8873 searches both tables to make a packet fo rwarding decision. In response to a Source Address (SA)\nlook up, only the dynamic table is searched  for aging, migration and learning purposes.\nThe static DA look up result takes prec edence over the dynamic DA look up result . If there is a DA match in both tables,\nthe result from the static table is  used. The entries in the static t able will not be aged out by the KSZ8873.\nThe static table is accessed by an external processor via the SMI, SPI or I2C interfaces. The external processor per-\nforms all addition, modification and deletion of static MAC table entries.Register 196(0xC4): Sleep Mode\n7-0 Sleep Mode R/WThis value is used to c ontrol the minimum period the \nno energy event has to be detected consecutively \nbefore the device enters the low power state when the \nED mode is on.\nThe unit is 20 ms.

If 802.1Q VLAN mode is enabled (register 5, bit 7 = 1), this\ntable will be used to retrieve the VLAN information that is associated with the ingress packet. This information includes\nFID (filter ID), VID (VLA N ID), and VLAN membership as described in Table 4-11 .\nIf 802.1Q VLAN mode is enabled, KSZ8873 will assign a VID to  every ingress packet. If the packet is untagged or tagged\nwith a null VID, the packet is assigned wi th the default port VID of the ingress po rt. If the packet is tagged with non-null\nVID, the VID in the tag will be used. The look up process will st art from the VLAN table look up. If the VID is not valid,\nthe packet will be dropped and no address learning will take plac e. If the VID is valid, the FID is retrieved.

For example, 101 means port 3 and 1 are in this VLAN.111\n15-12 FID R/WFilter ID. KSZ8873 supports 16 active VLANs repre-\nsented by these four bit fields. FID is the mapped ID.

The FID+ DA look up determines the forwarding  ports. If FID+DA  fails, the packet\nwill be broadcast to all the members (excluding the ingre ss port) of the VLAN. If FID+ SA fails, the FID+SA will be\nlearned.\nExamples:1.

In the heaviest condition, the counters will over flow in 2 minutes.\nIt is recommended that the software read all the counters at least every 30 seconds. \nA high performance SPI master is also recommended to prevent counters overflow.0x105 Port 3 RX Drop Packets RX packets dropped due to lack of resourcesTABLE 4-16: “ALL PORT DROPPED PACKET” MI B COUNTERS INDIRECT MEMORY OFFSETS\nOffset Counter Name Description\nKSZ8873MLL/FLL/RLL\nDS00002348A-page 74  \uf0e3 2017 Microchip Technology Inc.5.0 OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS\n5.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings*\nSupply Voltage (VIN)\n(VDDA_1.8 , VDDC) .............................................................................................................................. ......... –0.5V to +2.4V\n(VDDA_3.3 , VDDIO) .............................................................................................................................. ........ –0.5V to +4.0V\nInput Voltage .................................................................................................................. ........................... –0.5V to +4.0V\nOutput Voltage................................................................................................................. .......................... –0.5V to +4.0V\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s) .............................................................................................. .........................+260°C\nStorage Temperature (TS) ................ .............. .............. .............. .............. .............. .............. .............. ....–55°C to  +150°C\nHBM ESD Rating................................................................................................................. .....................................±3 kV\n*Exceeding the absolute maximum rating may damage the dev ice.
