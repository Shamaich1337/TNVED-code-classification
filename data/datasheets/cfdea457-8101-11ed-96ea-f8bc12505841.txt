The VCO features \ntemperature compensation  circuits that deli ver stable \nperformance across the operating temperature  range of -\n40 °C to +85  °C. The PLL/VCO engine combined with an \nexternal loop  filter allows the user to generate local \noscillator (LO) signals from 85  MHz to  4200  MHz. The LO \nsignal is buffered and rou ted to the integrated RF mixers \nwhich  are used to up/down -convert frequencies ranging \nfrom 30  MHz to 6000  MHz. The  mixer bias current is \nprogrammable and can be reduced for applications \nrequiring  lower power consumption. Both devices can be \nconfigured to work as signal  sources by bypassing the \nintegrated mixers. Device programming is achieved via a  \nsimple 3 -wire serial interface. In addition, a unique \nprogramming mode allows up to  four devices to be \ncontrolled from a common serial bus. This e liminates the \nneed  for separate chip -select control lines between each \ndevice and the host controller.  Up to six general purpose \noutputs are provided, which can be used to access internal  \nsignals (the LOCK signal, for example) or to control front \nend compo nents. Both  devices operate with a 2.7  V to  \n3.3 V power supply.  \nFunctional Block Diagram  \n \n \nFunctional Block Diagram – Simplified  Key Features  \n • 85 MHz to 4200  MHz LO  Frequency Range  \n• Fractional -N Synthesizer with  Very Low  \nSpurious  Levels  \n• Typical Step Size 1.5  Hz \n• Fully Integrated Low Phase Noise  VCO and LO Buffers  \n• Integrated Phase Noise  \n− 0.18° rms at 1  GHz \n− 0.52° rms at 3 GHz  \n• High Linearity RF Mixer(s)  \n• 30 MHz to 6000  MHz Mixer  Frequency Range  \n• Input IP3 +23  dBm \n• Mixer Bias Adjustable for Low Power Operation  \n• Full Duplex Mode (RFFC5071A)  \n• 2.7 V to 3.3  V Power Supply  \n• Low Current Consumption  \n• 3- or 4-Wire Serial Interface  \nApplications  \n • Wideband Radios  \n• Distributed Antenna Systems  \n• Diversity Receivers  \n• Software Defined Radios  \n• Frequency Band Shifters  \n• Point -to-Point Radios  \n• WiMax/LTE Infrastructure  \n• Satellite Communications  \n• Wideband Jammers  \n• Remote Radio Heads  \nOrdering Information  \n Part No.  Description  \nRFFC5071ATR13  2,500 Piece s on a 13” reel  \nDKFC5071A  Complete Design Kit with 3.7 GHz Baluns  \nRFFC5072ATR13  2,500 Piece s on a 13” reel  \nDKFC5072A  Complete Design Kit with 3.7 GHz Baluns  \nRFFC 5071 A\nSynth\nRef.\ndividerPhase\ndet.RFFC 5072 A\nSynth\nRef.\ndividerPhase\ndet.\n \n   RFFC5071A/2A  \nWIDEBAND SYNTHESIZER/VCO WITH  \nINTEGRATED 6  GHz MIXER  \nData sheet Rev.

E, April 8, 2022 | Subject to change without notice  4 of 27 www.qorvo.com    \n® \n \n \n \n  Theory of Operation  \nThe RFFC5071A and RFFC5072A are wideband RF frequency converter chips which include a fractional -N synthesizer and a  low noise \nVCO core. The RFFC5071A has an LO signal multiplexer, two LO buffer circuits, and two RF mixers. The RFFC5072A  has a single LO \nbuffer circuit and one RF mixer. Both devices have an integrated voltage reference and low drop out regulators  supplying critical circuit \nblocks such as the VCOs and synthesizer. Synthesizer programming, device configuration and control  are achieved through a mixture of \nhardware and software controls.  All on -chip registers are programmed through a simple 3 -wire serial interface.  \nVCO \nThe VCO core in the RFFC5071A and RFFC5072A consists of three VCOs which, in conjunction with the integrated LO dividers  of /2  \nto /32, cover the LO range of 85MHz to 4200  MHz. Each VCO has 128 overlapping bands which are used to achieve low  VCO gain  \nand optimal phase noise performance across the whole tuning range. The chip automatically selects the correct VCO  (VCO auto -select) \nand VCO band (VCO coarse tuning) to gen erate the desired LO frequency based on the values programmed  into the PLL1 and PLL2 \nregisters banks.  \n \nThe VCO auto select  and VCO coarse tuning are triggered every time ENBL is taken high, or if the PLL re -lock self -clearing bit is  \nprogrammed high. Once the correct VCO and band have been selected the PLL will lock onto the correct frequency. During the  band \nselection process, fixed capacitance elements are progressively connected to the VCO resonant circuit until the VCO is  oscillating \napproximately at the correct frequency. The output of this band selection, CT_CAL, is made available in the readback  register . A value \nof 127 or 0 in this register indicates that the coarse tuning was unsuccessful, and this will also be indicated  by the CT_FAILED flag also \navailable in the read -back register. A CT_CAL value between 1 and 126 indicates a successful  calibration, t he actual value being \ndependent on the desired frequency as well as process variation for a particular device.  \n \nThe band select process will center the VCO tuning voltage at about 0.8  V, compensating for manufacturing tolerances and process  \nvariation as we ll as environmental factors including temperature. The VCOs have temperature compensation circuits so  the PLL will hold \nlock over the entire operating temperature range of -40 °C to +85  °C. This is true regardless of the temperature  at which the VCO band \nselection is performed. The VCO gain is also held stable across temperature, maintaining consistent  loop bandwidth and synthesizer \nphase noise.  \n \nThe RFFC5071A and RFFC5072A feature a differential LO input to allow the mixer to be driven from an external LO source. The  fractional -\nN PLL can be used with an external VCO driven into this LO input, which may be useful to reduce phase noise in  some applications. This \nmay also require an external op -amp, dependent  on the tuning voltage required by the external VCO.  \n \nIn the RFFC5071A the LO signal is routed to mixer 1, mixer 2, or both mixers depending on the state of the MODE pin (or MODE   \nbit if under software control) and the value of the FULLD bit. Setting FULLD high puts the device into Full Duplex mode and b oth mixers \nare enabled.  \nFractional -N PLL  \nThe RFFC5071A and RFFC5072A contain a charge pump -based fractional -N phase locked loop (PLL) for controlling the three  VCOs. \nThe PLL includes automatic calibration systems to counteract the effects of process and environmental variations,  ensuring repeatable \nloop response and phase noise performance. As well as the VCO auto -select and coarse tuning, there is a  loop filter calibration \nmechanism which can be enabled if required. This operates by adjusting the charge pump current to  maintain loop bandwidth. This can \nbe useful for applications where the LO is tuned over a wide frequency range.  \n \nThe PLL has been designed to use a reference frequency of between 10  MHz and 104  MHz from an external source, which is  typicall y a \ntemperature controlled crystal oscillator (TCXO). A reference divider (divide by 1 to divide by 7) is supplied and  should be programmed \nto limit the frequency at the phase detector to a maximum of 52  MHz.  \n \nTwo PLL programming banks are provided, the fi rst bank is preceded by the label PLL1 and the second bank is preceded by the  label \nPLL2. For the RFFC5071A these banks are used to program mixer 1 and mixer 2 respectively,  and are selected automatically  as the \nmixer is selected using MODE. For the RFFC50 72A mixer 2 and register bank PLL2 are normally used.  \n \n   RFFC5071A/2A  \nWIDEBAND SYNTHESIZER/VCO WITH  \nINTEGRATED 6  GHz MIXER  \nData sheet Rev. E, April 8, 2022 | Subject to change without notice  5 of 27 www.qorvo.com    \n® \n \n \n \n  The VCO outputs are first divided down in a high frequency prescalar. The output of this high frequency prescalar then enters  the  \nN divider, which is a fractional divider containing a dual-modulus prescaler and a digitally spur -compensated fractional  sequence \ngenerator. This allows very fine frequency steps and minimizes fractional spurs. The fractional energy is randomized  and appears as \nfractional noise at frequency offsets above 100  kHz which will be attenuated by the loop filter. An external loop  filter is used, giving \nflexibility in setting loop bandwidth for optimizing phase noise and lock time, for example.  \n \nThe synthesizer step size is typically 1.5  Hz when using a 26  MHz referen ce frequency. The exact step size for any reference and  LO \nfrequency can be calculated using the following formula:  \n \n(FREF * P) / (R * 224 * LO_DIV)  \n \nWhere F REF is the reference frequency, R is the reference division ratio, P is the prescalar division ratio, and LO_DIV is the LO   \ndivider value.  \n \nPin 26 (GPO4) can be configured as a lock detect pin. The lock status is also available in the read -back register. The lock detect  function \nis a window detector on the VCO tuning voltage. The lock flag will be high to show PLL lock which corresponds to the  VCO tuning voltage \nbeing within the specified range, typically 0.30  V to 1.25  V. \n \nThe lock time of the PLL will depend  on a number of factors; including the loop bandwidth and the reference frequency at the  phase \ndetector. This clock frequency determines the speed at which the state machine and internal calibrations run. A 52  MHz phase detector \nfrequency will give fastest  lock times, of typically <50  \uf06dsecs when using the PLL re -lock bit.  \nPhase Detector and Charge Pump  \nThe phase detector provides a current output to drive an active loop filter. The charge pump output current is set by the val ue contained \nin the P1_CP_DEF and P2_CP_DEF fields in the loop filter configuration register. The charge pump current is given  by approximately  \n3 \uf06dA/bit, and the fields are 6 bits long. This gives default value (31) of 93  \uf06dA and maximum value (63) of  189 \uf06dA. \n \nIf the automati c loop bandwidth calibration is enabled the charge pump current is set by the calibration algorithm based upon  the  \nVCO gain.  \n \nThe phase detector will operate with a maximum input frequency of 52  MHz. \nLoop Filter  \nThe active loop filter is implemented using the on -chip low noise op -amp with external resistors and capacitors. The internal  configuration \nof the chip is shown below with the recommended active loop filter. The op -amp gives a tuning voltage range of  typically +0.1  V to  \n+2.4 V. Th e recommended loop filter shown is designed to give the lowest integrated phase noise for reference  frequencies of between \n26 MHz and 52  MHz. The external loop filter gives the flexibility to optimize the loop response for  any particular application and \ncombination of reference and VCO frequencies.  \n \n \n\n \n   RFFC5071A/2A  \nWIDEBAND SYNTHESIZER/VCO WITH  \nINTEGRATED 6  GHz MIXER  \nData sheet Rev. E, April 8, 2022 | Subject to change without notice  6 of 27 www.qorvo.com    \n® \n \n \n  External Frequency Reference  \nThe RFFC5071A and RFFC5072A have been designed to use an external reference such as a TCXO. The typical input will be a   \n0.8 Vp-p clipped sine wave, which should be AC -coupled into the reference input. When the PLL is not in use, it may be desirable  to turn \noff the internal reference circuits, by setting the REFSTBY bit low, to minimize current draw while in standby mode.  \n \nOn cold start, or if REFSTBY is programmed low, the reference circuits will need a warm -up period. This is set by the SU_WAIT  bits.  \nThis will allow the clock to be stable and immediately available when the ENBL bit is asserted high, allowing the PLL to  assume  \nnormal operation.  \n \nIf the current consumption of the reference circuits in standby mode, typically 2  mA, is not critical, then the REFSTBY bit can be  set high. \nThis allows the fastest startup and lock time after ENBL is taken high.  \nWideband Mixer  \nThe mixers are wideband, double -balanced Gilbert cells. They support RF/IF frequencies from 30  MHz up to 6000  MHz. Each  mixer has \nan input port and an output port that can be used for either IF or RF (in other words, for up - or down -conversion). The  mixer current can \nbe programmed to between about 15  mA and 45  mA depending on linearity requirements. The majority of the  mixer current is sourced \nthrough the output pins via either a center -tapped balun or an RF choke in the external matching circuitry  to the supply.  \n \nThe RF mixer input and output ports are differential and require baluns and simple matching circuits optimized to the specific  application \nfrequencies. A conversion gain of approximately -2 dB (not including balun losses) is achieved with 100  \uf057 differential  input  impedance, \nand the outputs driving 200  \uf057 differential load impedance. Increasing the mixer output load increases  the conversion gain.  \n \nThe mixer has a broadband common gate input. The input impedance is dominated by the resistance set by the mixer 1/gm  term, which \nis inversely proportional to the mixer current setting. The resistance will be approximately 85  \uf057 at the default mixer  current setting (100). \nThere is also some shunt capacitance at the mixer input, and the inductance of the bond wires (ab out 0.5 nH on each pin) to consider at \nhigher frequencies. The following diagram is a simple model of the mixer input impedance:  \n \n \n \nThe mixer output is high impedance, consisting of approximately 2  k\uf057 resistance in parallel with some capacitance, approximately  1 pF \ndependent on PCB layout. The mixer output does not require a conjugate matching network. It is a constant current  output which will \ndrive a real differential load of between 50  Ω and 500  Ω, typically 200  Ω. Since the mixer output is a constant  current source, a higher \nresistance load will give higher output voltage and gain. A shunt inductor can be used to resonate with  the mixer output capacitance at \nthe frequency of interest. This inductor may not be required at lower frequencies where the  impedance of the output capacitance is less \nsignificant. At higher output frequencies the inductance of the bond wires (about  0.5 nH on each pin) becomes more significant. Above \nabout 4500  MHz, it is benef icial to lower the output load to 50  \uf057 to minimize  the effect of the ou tput capacitance.

The  mixers \ncan be set up to operate in half duplex mode (1 mixer active) or full duplex mode (both mixers active). This selection is  done via control \nof MODE and by setting the FULLD bit. When in full duplex mode, either PLL register bank can be used, the LO  signal is routed to  \nboth mixers.   \nMode  FULLD  Active PLL  Register Bank  Active  Mixer  \nLow 0 1 1 \nHigh 0 2 2 \nLow 1 1 1 and 2  \nHigh 1 2 1 and 2  \nSerial Interface  \nAll on -chip registers in the RFFC5071A and RFFC5072A are programmed using a proprietary 3 -wire serial bus which supports  both write \nand read operations. Synthesizer programming, device configuration, and control are achieved through a mixture of  hardware and \nsoftware controls. Certain  functions and operations require the use of hardware controls via the ENBL, MODE,  and RESETX  pins in \naddition to programming via the serial bus. Alternatively , there is the option to control the chip completely  via the serial bus  \n \nThe serial data interfac e can be configured for 4 -wire operation by setting the 4WIRE bit in the SDI_CTRL register high. Then  pin 26 is \nused as the data out pin, and pin 32 is the serial data in pin.  \nHardware Control  \nThree hardware control pins are provided: ENBL, MODE, and RESETX . \n \nThe ENBL pin has two functions: to enable the analog circuits in the chip and to trigger the VCO auto -selection and coarse tuning  \nmechanisms. The VCO auto -selection and coarse tuning is ini tiated when the ENBL pin is taken high. Every time the frequency  of the \nsynthesizer is reprogrammed, ENBL has to be asserted high to initiate these mechanisms and then to initiate the  PLL locking. Alternatively \nfollowing the programming of a new frequency,  the PLL re -lock self -clearing bit could be used.  \n \nThe RESETX  pin is a hardware reset control that will reset all digital circuits to their startup state when asserted low. The device  includes \na power -on-reset function, so this pin should not normally be r equired, in which case it should be connected to the  positive supply.  \n \nThe MODE pin controls which mixer(s) and PLL programming register bank is active.  \nSerial Data Interface Control  \nThe normal mode of operation uses the 3 -wire serial data interface to program the device registers, and three extra hardware  control \nlines: MODE, ENBL and RESETX . \n \nWhen the device is under software control, achieved by setting the SIPIN bit in the SDI_CTRL register high, then the hardware  can be \ncontrolled via the SDI_CTRL register. When this is the case, the three hardware control lines are not required. If the  device is under \nsoftware control, pins 1 and 9 can be configured as general purpose outputs (GPO).  \n \n   RFFC5071A/2A  \nWIDEBAND SYNTHESIZER/VCO WITH  \nINTEGRATED 6  GHz MIXER  \nData sheet Rev.

The device address pins   \n(15 and 16) ADD1 and ADD2 are used to set the address of each part.  \n \nOn power up, and after a reset, the devices ignore the address pi ns ADD1 and ADD2 and any data presented to the serial bus  will be \nprogrammed into all the devices. However, once the ADDR bit in the SDI_CTRL register is set, each device then adopts  an address \naccording to the state of the address pins on the device.  \nGeneral Purpose Outputs  \nThe general purpose outputs (GPOs) can be controlled via the GPO register and will depend on the state of MODE since they  can be set \nin different states corresponding to either mixer path 1 or 2. For example, the GPOs can be used to drive LEDs or to  control external \ncircuitry such as switches or low power LNAs.  \n \nEach GPO pin can supply approximately 20  mA load current. The output voltage of the GPO high state will drop with increased  current \ndrive by approximately 25  mV/mA. Si milarly, the output voltage of the GPO low state will rise with increased current,  again by \napproximately 25  mV/mA.  \nExternal Modulation  \nThe RFFC5071A and RFFC5072A fractional -N synthesizer can be used to modulate the frequency of the VCO. There are two dedicated \nregisters, EXT_MOD and FMOD, which can be used to configure the device as a modulator. It is possible to modulate  the VCO in  \ntwo ways:  \n \n1.Binary FSK  \nThe MODSETUP bits in the EXT_MOD register are set to 11. GPO3 is then configured as an input and used to control the signal  \nfrequency. The frequency deviation is set by the MODSTEP and MODULATION bits in the EXT_MOD and FMOD registers respectively.  \n \nThe modulation frequency is calculated according to the following formula:  \nFMOD = 2MODSTEP \uf0d7 FPD \uf0d7 (MODULATION) \uf0a4 216 \nWhere MODULATION is a 2\'s complement number and F PD is the phase detector frequency  \n \n2.Continuous Modulation  \nThe MODSETUP bits in the EXT_MOD register are set to 01. The frequency deviation is set by the MODSTEP and MODUL ATION  bits \nin the EXT_MOD and FMOD registers respectively. The VCO frequency is then changed by writing a new value into the MODULATION  \nbits, the VCO frequency is instantly updated. An arbitrary frequency modulation can then be performed dependent  only on the rate at \nwhich values are written into the FMOD register.  \n \nThe modulation frequency is calculated according to the following formula:  \nFMOD = 2MODSTEP \uf0d7 FPD \uf0d7 (MODULATION) \uf0a4 216 \nWhere MODULATION is a 2\'s complement number and F PD is the phase detector frequency  \nSlice 2\n(0)Slice 2\n(1)\nA1A2 A1A2\nVddSlice 2\n(2)\nA2 A1\nVddSlice 2\n(3)\nA2 A1\nVdd Vdd                     \n                                          ENX\nSDATA\nSCLK\n \n   RFFC5071A/2A  \nWIDEBAND SYNTHESIZER/VCO WITH  \nINTEGRATED 6  GHz MIXER  \nData sheet Rev.
