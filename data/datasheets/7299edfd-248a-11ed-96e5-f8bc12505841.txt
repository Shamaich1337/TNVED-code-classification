The AD8099 \nfeatures a new, highly linear, low noise input stage that increases \nthe full power bandwidth (FPBW) at low gains with high slew rates. The Analog Devices, Inc ., proprietary next generation \nextra fast complimentary bipolar ( XFCB ) process enables such \nhigh performance amplifiers with relatively low power.  \nThe AD8099 features external compensation, which lets the use r \nset the gain bandwidth product. External compensation allows gains from +2 to +10 with minimal trade -off in bandwidth. The \nAD8099 also features an extremely high slew rate of  1350 V/µs, \ngiving the designer flexibility to use the entire dynami c range \nwithout tradi ng off bandwidth or distortion.  The AD8099 \nsettles to 0.1% in 18 ns and recovers from overdrive in 50 ns.

Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may affect product reliability.  \nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIP ATION  \nThe maximum safe power dissipation in the AD8099 package is \nlimited by the associated rise in junction temperature (T J) on \nthe die. The pla stic encapsulating the die locally reach es the \njunction temperature. At approximately 150°C, which is the glass transitio n temperature, the plastic change s its properties. \nEven temporarily exceeding this temperature limit may change \nthe stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently \nshifting the parametric performance of the AD8099. Exceeding \na junction temperature of 150°C for an extended period can result in changes in silicon devices, potentially causing failure.  \nThe still -air thermal proper ties of the package and PCB (θ\nJA), \nthe ambient temperature (T A), and the total power dissipated in \nthe package (P D) determine the junction temperature of the die. \nThe junction temperature can be calculated as  \n()JA D A J θ P T T ×+=  \nThe power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the \npackage due to the load drive for all outputs. The quiescent \npower is the voltage between the supply pins (V S) times the \nquiescent current (I S). Assuming the loa d (R L) is referenced to \nmidsupply, the total drive power is V S/2 × I OUT, some of which is \ndissipated in the package and some in the load (V OUT × IOUT).  \nThe difference between the total drive power and the load \npower is the drive power dissipated in the pa ckage.  \nPD = Quiescent Power  + (Total Drive Power − Load Power ) ()\nL2\nOUT\nLOUT S\nS S DRV–RV\n2VI V P\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb×+×=  \nRMS output voltages should be considered. If R L is referenced to \nVS−, as in single -supply operation, then the total drive power is \nVS × I OUT. If the rms signal levels are  indeterminate, consider the \nworst case, when V OUT = V S/4 for R L to midsupply : \n()()\nLS\nS S DR/VI V P24+×=  \nIn single -supply operatio n with R L referenced to V S–, worst case \nis V OUT = V S/2. \nAirflow increas es heat dissipation, effectively reducing θ JA. Also, \nmore metal directly in contact with the package leads from metal  \ntraces, through holes, ground, and power planes reduce the θ JA. \nSoldering the exposed paddle to the ground plane significantly reduces the overall thermal resistance of the package. Take care \nto m inimize parasitic capaci tances at the input leads of high \nspeed op amps, as discussed in the PCB Layout  section.  \nFigure 4 shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage versus the ambient temperatu re for the exposed paddle \n(EPAD ) SOIC -8 (70°C/W), and LFCSP (70°C/W), packages on \na JEDEC standard 4 -layer board. θ\nJA values are approximations.  04511-0-115 AMBIENT TEMPERATURE ( °C)120 –40 –20 0 20 40 60 80 100MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (Watts)\n0.04.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5LFCSP AND SOIC\n \nFigure 4.

E | Page 15 of 26 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8099 is a voltage feedback op amp that employs a new \nhighly linear low noise input stage. With this input stage, the \nAD8099 can achieve better than 90 dB distortion for a 2 V p-p, 10 MHz output signal with an input referred voltage noise of \nless than 1 nV/√Hz. This noise level and distortion performance \nhas been previously achievable only with fully uncompensated amplifiers. The AD8099 achieves this level of performance for \ngains as low as +2. This new input stage also triples the achievable \nslew rate for comparably compensated 1 nV/√Hz amplifiers. \nThe simplified AD8099 topology is shown in Figure 58. The \namplifier is a single gain stage with a unity gain output buffer \nfabricated in the Analog Devices extra fast complimentary \nbipolar (XFCB) process. The AD8099 has 85 dB of open-loop \ngain and maintains precision specifications such as CMRR, \nPSRR, V\nOS, and \uf044VOS/\uf044T to levels that are normally associated \nwith topologies having two or more gain stages. \nBUFFER gm\nCC R1 RLVOUT\n04511-0-060 \nFigure 58. AD8099  Topology \nThe AD8099 can be externally compensated down to a gain of 2 \nthrough the use of an RC network. Above gains of 15, no external \ncompensation network is required. To realize the full gain bandwidth product of the AD8099 , no PCB trace should be \nconnected to or within close proximity of the external compen-\nsation pin for the lowest possible capacitance.  \nExternal compensation allows the user to optimize the closed-\nloop response for minimal peaking while increasing the gain \nbandwidth product in higher gains, lowering distortion errors \nthat are normally more prominent with internally compensated parts in higher gains. For a fixed gain bandwidth, wideband distortion products would normally increase by 6 dB going from a closed-loop gain of 2 to 4. Increasing the gain bandwidth \nproduct of the AD8099 eliminates this effect with increasing \nclosed-loop gain.  \nThe AD8099 is available in both a SOIC and an LFCSP , each of \nwhich has a thermal pad for lower operating temperature. To \nhelp avoid this pad in board layout, both packages have an extra output pin on the opposite side of the package for ease in con-necting a feedback network to the inputs. The secondary output pin also isolates the interaction of any capacitive load on the \noutput and self-inductance of the package and bond wire from the feedback loop. While using the secondary output for feed-\nback, inductance in the primary output now helps to isolate capacitive loads from the output impedance of the amplifier. Since the SOIC has greater inductance in its output, the SOIC \ndrives capacitive loads better than the LFCSP . Using the primary \noutput for feedback with both packages results in the LFCSP \ndriving capacitive load better than the SOIC.  \nThe LFCSP and SOIC pinouts are identical, except for the \nrotation of all pins counterclockwise by one pin on the LFCSP . This isolates the inputs from the negative power supply pin, removing a mutually inductive coupling that is most prominent \nwhile driving heavy loads. For this reason, the LFCSP second \nharmonic, while driving a heavy load, is significantly better \nthan that of the SOIC.  \nA three-state input pin is provided on the AD8099 for a high \nimpedance power-down and an optional input bias current \ncancellation circuit. The high impedance output allows several AD8099  devices to drive the same ADC or output line time inter-\nleaved. Pulling the DISABLE\n pin low activates the high impedance \nstate. See Table 5 for threshold levels. When the DISABLE  pin is \nleft floating, the AD8099 operates normally. With the DISABLE  \npin pulled within 0.7 V of the positive supply, an optional input bias current cancellation circuit is turned on, which lowers the input bias current to less than 200 nA. In this mode, the user can drive the AD8099 with a high dc source impedance and still \nmaintain minimal output referred offset without having to use \nimpedance matching techniques. In addition, the AD8099 can \nbe ac-coupled while setting the bias point on the input with a high dc impedance network. The input bias current cancellation circuit doubles the input referred current noise, but this effect is \nminimal as long as wideband impedance is kept low (see Figure 48 \nand Figure 51). \nA pair of internally connected diodes limits the differential \nvoltage between the noninverting input and the inverting input of the AD8099. Each set of diodes has two series diodes, which are connected in anti-parallel. This limits the differential voltage \nbetween the inputs to approximately \uf0b11.8 V . All of the AD8099 \npins are ESD protected with voltage limiting diodes connected \nbetween both rails. The protection diodes can handle 5 mA of steady state current. Currents should be limited to 5 mA or less \nthrough the use of a series limiting resistor.  \n \nAD8099 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 16 of 26 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nUSING THE AD8099 \nThe AD8099 offers unrivaled noise and distortion performance \nin low signal gain configurations. In low gain configurations \n(less than 15), the AD8099 requires external compensation. The \namount of gain and performance needed determines the compensation network.  \nUnderstanding the subtleties of the AD8099 gives the user insight \non how to exact its peak performance. Use the component values \nand circuit configurations shown in the Applications Information section as starting points for designs. Specific circuit applications \ndictate the final configuration and value of the components. \nCIRCUIT COMPONENTS \nThe circuit components are referenced in Figure 59, the \nrecommended noninverting circuit schematic for the AD8099. \nSee Table 4 for typical component values and performance data.  \n1\n847\n5362\nAD8099\nC5\n0.1\uf06dF\nCCCF\nC1\nC4\n10\uf06dFC2\n10\uf06dF\nC3\n0.1\uf06dF\nRCRF\nRG\nRS\nR1+VS\n–VSVOUT\nDISABLE\n04511-0-061VIN\n \nFigure 59. Wideband Noninverti ng Gain Configuration (SOIC) \nRF and R G—The feedback resistor and the gain set resistor \ndetermine the noise gain of the amplifier; typical R F values \nrange from 250 Ω to 499 Ω.  CF—Creates a zero in the loop response to compensate the pole \ncreated by the input capacitance (including stray capacitance) \nand the feedback resistor, R F. C F helps reduce high frequency \npeaking and ringing in the closed-loop response. The typical range is 0.5 pF to 1.5 pF for the evaluation circuits used here. \nR1—This resistor terminates the input of the amplifier to the \nsource resistance of the signal source, typically 50 Ω. (This is \napplication specific and not always required.) \nR\nS—Many high speed amplifiers in low gain configurations \nrequire that the input stage be terminated into a nominal \nimpedance to maintain stability. The value of R S should be kept \nto 50 Ω or lower to maintain low noise performance. At higher gains, R\nS may be reduced or even eliminated. Typical range is \n0 Ω to 50 Ω. \nCC—The compensation capacitor decreases the open-loop gain \nat higher frequencies where the phase is degrading. By decreas-\ning the open-loop gain here, the phase margin is increased and the amplifier is stabilized. Typical range is 0 pF to 5 pF. The \nvalue of C\nC is gain dependent. \nRC—The series lead inductance of the package and the com-\npensation capacitance (C C) forms a series resonant circuit. \nRC dampens this resonance and prevents oscillations. The \nrecommended value of R C is 50 Ω for a closed-loop gain of 2. \nThis resistor introduces a zero in the open-loop response and \nmust be kept low so that this zero occurs at a higher frequency. The purpose of the compensation network is to decrease the open-loop gain. If the resistance becomes too large, the gain is \nreduced to the resistor value, and not necessarily to 0 Ω, which \nis what a single capacitor would do over frequency. Typical \nvalue range is 0 Ω to 50 Ω. \nC1—To lower the impedance of R\nC , C1 is placed in parallel with \nRC. C1 is not required, but greatly reduces peaking at low \nclosed-loop gains. The typical value range is 0 pF to 2 pF.  C2 and C3—Bypass capacitors are connected between both \nsupplies for optimum distortion and PSRR performance. These capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the supply \npins of the amplifier. For \nC3 and C5,  a 0508 case size should be \nused. The 0508 case size offers reduced inductance and better \nfrequency response. \nC4 and C2—Electrolytic bypass capacitors. \n \n \n    \n \n \nData Sheet  AD8099  \n \nRev.

E | Page 21 of 26 TOTAL OUTPUT NOISE C ALCULATIONS AND \nDESIGN  \nTo analyze the noise performance of an amplifier circuit, \nthe individual noise sources must be identified. A user must \nthen determine if the source has a significant contribution to \noverall  noise performance of the amplifier. To simplify the \nnoise  calculations, this data sheet work s with noise spectral \ndensities  rather than actual voltages to leave bandwidth out \nof the expressions (noise spectral density, which is generally \nexpressed  in nV/√Hz, is equivalent to the noise in a 1  Hz \nbandwidth).  \nThe noise model shown in Figure 74 has six individual noise \nsources: the Johnson noise of the three resistors, the op amp \nvoltage noise, and t he current noise in each input of the amplifier.  \nEach noise source has its own contribution to the noise at the \noutput. Noise is generally specified referred to input ( RTI), but \nit is often simpler to calculate the noise referred  to the output \n(RTO) and then divid e by the noise gain to obtain the RTI noise.  \nAll resistors have a Johnson noise of √ (4kBTR ), where k is \nBoltzmann’s Constant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K), T is the absolute \ntemperature in Kelvin, B is the bandwidth in Hz, and R is the resistance in ohms. A simple relationship, which is easy to \nremember, is that a 50 Ω resistor generates a Johnson noise of \n1 nV√Hz at 25°C. The AD8099 amplifier has roughly the same \nequivalent noise as a 50 Ω resistor.  \n04511-0-070GAIN FROM\n"B" TO OUTPUT=–R2\nR1GAIN FROM\n"A" TO OUTPUT=\nNOISE GAIN =\nNG = 1 +R2\nR1IN–\nVNVN, R1\nVN, R3R1R2\nIN+R34kTR2\n4kTR1\n4kTR3VN, R2\nB\nA\nVN2 + 4kTR3 + 4kTR1      R22\nR1 + R2\nIN+2R32 + IN–2R1× R22\n + 4kTR2R12\n R1 + R2 R1 + R2RTI NOISE =\nRTO NOISE = NG × RTI NOISEVOUT\n+\n \nFigure 74. Op Amp Noise Analysis Model  \nIn applications where noise sensitivity is critical, care must be \ntaken not to introduce other significant noise sources to the \namplifier. Each resistor is a noise source. Attention to design, \nlayout, and component selection is critical to maintain low noise performance. A summary of noise performance for the amplifier and associated resistors can b e seen in Table 4. \n \n \n \n INPUT BIAS CURRENT A ND DC OFFSET  \nIn high noise gain configurations, the effects of output offset \nvoltage can be significant, even with low input bias currents and \ninput offset voltages.

The voltage generated by I B− \nthrough  R2 is summed together with the previous offset voltages to \narriv e at a final output offset voltage. The offset voltage can also \nbe referred to the input (RTI) by dividing the calculated output \noffset voltage by the noise gain.  \nAs seen in Figure 75, if I B+ and I B– are the same and R3 equals \nthe parallel combination of R1 and R2, then the RTI offset \nvoltage can be reduced to only V OS.

E | Page 23 of 26 CIRCUIT CONSIDERATIO NS \nOptimizing the performance of the AD8099 requires at tention \nto detail in layout and signal routing of the board. Power supply \nbypassing, parasitic capacitance, and component selection all contribute to the overall performance of the amplifier.  The \nAD8099 features an exposed paddle on the backs of both  the \nLFCSP  and SOIC packages. The exposed paddle provides a low \nthermal resis tive path to the ground plane. For best performance,  \nsolder the exposed paddle to the ground plane.  \nPCB Layout  \nThe compensation network is de termined by the amplifier \ngain  requirements. For lower gains, the layout and component \nplacement  are more critical. For higher gains, there are fewer \ncompensation components, which results in a less complex \nlayout.  \nParasitics  \nThe area surrounding the compensation pin is very sensitive to \nparasitic capacitance. To realize the full gain bandwidth product \nof the AD8099, there should be no trace connected to or within close proximity of the external compensation pin for the lowest \npossible capacitance. When compensa tion is required, the traces  \nto the compe nsation pin, the negative supply, and the interconnect  \nbetween components (C\nC, C1, and R C in Figure  59) should be \nmade as wide as possible to minimize inductance.  \nAll ground and power planes under the pins of the AD8099 should be cleared of copper to prevent parasitic capacitance \nbetween the input and output pins to ground. A single mount-\ning pad on a SOIC footprint can add as much as 0.2  pF of \ncapacitance to ground as a result of not clearing the ground or \npower plane under the AD8099 pins. Para sitic capacitance can \ncause peaking and instability, and should be minimized to \nensure proper operation.  \nThe new pinout of the AD8099 reduces the distance between \nthe output and the inverting input of the amplifier. This helps \nto minimize the parasitic inductance and capacitance of the \nfeedback path, which, in turn, reduces ringing and second \nharmonic distortion.  \nGrounding  \nWhen possible , ground and power planes should be used. Ground  \nand power planes reduce the resistance and inductance of the \npower supply feeds and ground returns. If multiple planes are used, they should be stitched  together with multiple vias. The \nreturns for the input , output terminations, bypass capacitors,  and \nRG should all be kept as clos e to the AD8099  as possible. Ground \nvias should be placed  at the very end of the component mounting \npad to provide a solid ground return.  The output load ground and  \nthe bypass capacitor grounds should be returned to a common point on the ground plane to minimize parasitic inductance and \nimprove distortion performance.  The AD8099 packages feature \nan exposed paddle. For optimum performance, solder this \npaddle to ground.  For more information on PCB layout and \ndesign considerations, refer to se ction 7 -2 of the 2002 Analog \nDevices Op Amp Applications book.   \nPower Supply Bypassing  \nThe AD8099 power supply bypassing has been optimized \nfor each gain configuration as shown in Figure  60 through \nFigure  66 in the Circuit Configurations  section. The values \nshown should be used when possible. Bypassing is critical for \nstability, freq uency response, distortion, and PSRR performance . \nThe 0.1 µF capacitors shown in Figure  60 through Figure  66 \nshould be as close to the supply pins of the AD8099 as possible \nand the electrolytic capacitors beside them.  \nComponent Sele ction  \nSmaller components less than 1206 SMT case size, offer smalle r \nmounting pads, which ha ve fewer  parasitics and allow for a more  \ncompact layout. It is critical for optimum performance that high quality, ti ght tolerance (where  critical), and low drift c ompo nents  \nbe used. For example, tight tolerance and low drift is critical in \nthe selection of the feedback capacitor used in Figure  60. The \nfeedback compensation capac itor in Figure  60 is 1.5  pF. This \ncapacitor should be specified with NPO material. NPO material \ntypically has a ± 30 ppm/°C change over − 55°C to +125° C \ntemperature range. For a 100°C change, this  results in a 4.5  fF \nchange in capacitance, compared to an X7R material, which \nresults in a 0.23 pF change, a 15% change from the nomina l value. \nThis c an introduce excessive peaking, as shown in Figure 71. \nDESIGN TOOLS AND TEC HNICAL SUPPORT  \nAnalog Devices is committed to the design process by providing technical support and online design tools.
