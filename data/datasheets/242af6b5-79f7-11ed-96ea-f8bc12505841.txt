By selecting appropriate external opticalcomponents (see \nIR LED and PIN Photodiode Selection\nsection), the MAX3120 will operate at data rates of\n2.4kbps to 115kbps at distances from 1cm to 1m.Because of its low-noise design, the MAX3120achieves a bit error rate (BER) below 10\n-8at maximum\ndata rates when used with the appropriate externalcomponents. On-chip filtering rejects out-of-bandambient light signals that would otherwise interfere withIR communication. Also included in the MAX3120 is a high-power LED driver capable of sinking 200mA. Itcan drive most available IR LEDs at IrDA speeds of2.4kbps to 115kbps.Receiver\nThe MAX3120’s IR receiver amplifier reverse biases thePIN diode by approximately 1.2V, and the PIN diodeconverts pulses of IR light into pulses of current. Theinput transimpedance (current-to-voltage) amplifierthen converts these current pulses into voltage pulsesof a useful magnitude. The MAX3120 filters the result-ing output voltage pulses to remove low-frequencyambient light interference and high-frequency circuitnoise. Finally, a high-speed comparator translatesthese voltage pulses into usable CMOS output levels(Figure 1).\nMAX3120\nTransmitter\nThe MAX3120’s IR transmitter consists of a high-power\nMOS switch, capable of quickly switching 200mA withless than 2 Ωof on-resistance. Internal buffering keeps\nthe input capacitance of the TXD pin extremely low toease the input drive requirement. Connect an IR LED inseries with a current-setting resistor to select the appro-priate IR output power (see the \nPowering the IR LED\nsection). Note that the transmitter does not have anautomatic shutoff circuit, so pay special attention to com-ponent power dissipation in high-duty-cycle transmitschemes.\nApplications Information\nIR LED and PIN Photodiode Selection\nThe IrDA specification calls for an IR transmitter with apeak wavelength between 850nm and 900nm. Within a±15° half-cone-angle, the output intensity of the IR LEDmust be between 40mW/sr and 500mW/sr. Outside a±30° half-cone-angle, the output intensity of the IR LEDmust fall below 40mW/sr. The optical rise and fall timesof the IR LED must be less than 600ns. Based on thesesystem requirements, the Hewlett Packard HSDL-4220or the Temic TSHF5400 IR LEDs are two appropriatechoices.\nAppropriate PIN photodiode selection is extremely\nimportant to system performance. The PIN diode mustgenerate at least 200nA (minimum sensitivity of theMAX3120) of current when aimed ±15° off-axis with anincident irradiance of 4µW/cm\n2. Use the following equa-\ntion to determine if the Temic BPV22NF meets theserequirements:The first term (4µW/cm\n2) is the minimum guaranteed\nirradiance in the ±15° angular range. The second term(0.075cm\n2) is the effective sensitive area of the PIN\ndiode. The factor of 1.8 accounts for the efficiencyincrease due to the spherical lens. The first 0.95 factornormalizes the sensitivity to the 875nm wavelength,while the second 0.95 factor adjusts for decreasedreceiver efficiency at ±15° off-axis. The last term,0.6A/W, is the sensitivity of the PIN diode. In this exam-ple, the Temic BPV22NF is an appropriate selection.\nThe final important factor in selecting a PIN diode is\neffective diode capacitance. It is important to keep thiscapacitance below 70pF at 1.2V reverse bias. Higherinput capacitance can compromise system noise per-formance by increasing the noise gain of the input tran-simpedance amplifier.\nPowering the IR LED\nSet the current in the IR LED using an external resistor.Consult the IR LED manufacturer’s data sheet to selecta forward current that will meet IrDA specifications dis-cussed in the \nIR LED and PIN Photodiode Selection\nsection. Look up the drop across the LED (V LED) and\nthe drop across the MAX3120 LED driver (see Typical\nOperating Characteristics - VLEDC ) and choose the cur-\nrent-setting resistor based on the following equation:\nUsing the Hewlett Packard HSDL-4220 IR LED as an\nexample, V CC= 5V, I SET= 100mA, and V LED= 1.67V,\ntherefore: \nVLEDC = 0.08V\nRSET= 32.5ΩR=  V- V - V\nISETCC LED LEDC\nSETIPIN=\n=(4 W/cm )(0.075cm )(1.8)(0.95) (0.6A/W)\n     291nA22 2\n µLow-Profile, 3V, 120µA,\nIrDA Infrared Transceiver\n6 _______________________________________________________________________________________Figure 1.

Use a separate analog supply voltage wherepossible. Place a 1µF ceramic bypass capacitor asclose to the V\nCCpin as possible. In especially noisy\nsystems, connect a small (10 Ω) resistor in series with\nVCC, in addition to the normal bypass capacitor.Layout Considerations\nThe MAX3120 requires careful layout techniques to mini-mize parasitic signal coupling to the PINC input. Keepthe lead length between the photodiode and PINC asshort as possible. Be sure to keep PC board traces tothe PIN diode separate from other noisy traces. To mini-mize coupling, run the AGND trace adjacent to the PINCtrace on both sides. To prevent oscillation, avoid routingthe RXD signal near the PINC signal. Connect the anodeof the PIN diode, the GND pin, and the supply bypasscapacitor pin in a star-ground connection. ConnectPGND and GND together. Reduce the output tracelength from RXD as much as possible to minimize cou-pling back to the input via parasitic capacitance.\nChip Information\nTRANSISTOR COUNT: 256\nMAX3120Low-Profile, 3V, 120µA,\nIrDA Infrared Transceiver\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 7Package Information\n\nMAX3120Low-Profile, 3V, 120µA,\nIrDA Infrared Transceiver\nMaxim cannot assume responsibility for use of any circuitry other than circuitry entirely embodied in a Maxim product.
