K 05/18 EN 6Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2011 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nDevice Description\nThe N25Q is a high-performance multiple input/output serial Flash memory device\nmanufactured on 65nm NOR technology. It features execute-in-place (XIP) functionali-\nty, advanced write protection mechanisms, and a high-speed SPI-compatible bus inter-\nface. Innovative, high-performance, dual and quad input/output instructions enable\ndouble or quadruple the transfer bandwidth for READ and PROGRAM operations.\nFeatures\nThe memory is organized as 64 (64KB) main sectors that are further divided into 16 sub-\nsectors each (1024 subsectors in total). The memory can be erased one 4KB subsector at\na time, 64KB sectors at a time, or as a whole.\nThe memory can be write protected by software through volatile and nonvolatile pro-\ntection features, depending on the application needs. The protection granularity is of\n64KB (sector granularity) for volatile protections\nThe device has 64 one-time programmable (OTP) bytes that can be read and program-\nmed with the READ OTP and PROGRAM OTP commands. These 64 bytes can also be\npermanently locked with a PROGRAM OTP command.\nThe device also has the ability to pause and resume PROGRAM and ERASE cycles by us-\ning dedicated PROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND and RESUME instructions.\nOperating Protocols\nThe memory can be operated with three different protocols:\n• Extended SPI (standard SPI protocol upgraded with dual and quad operations)\n• Dual I/O SPI\n• Quad I/O SPI\nThe standard SPI protocol is extended and enhanced by dual and quad operations. In\naddition, the dual SPI and quad SPI protocols improve the data access time and\nthroughput of a single I/O device by transmitting commands, addresses, and data\nacross two or four data lines.\nXIP Mode\nXIP mode requires only an address (no instruction) to output data, improving random\naccess time and eliminating the need to shadow code onto RAM for fast execution.\nAll protocols support XIP operation. For flexibility, multiple XIP entry and exit methods\nare available. For applications that must enter XIP mode immediately after power-up,\nnonvolatile configuration register bit settings can enable XIP as the default mode.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nDevice Description\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev. K 05/18 EN 7Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2011 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nDevice Configurability\nThe N25Q family offers additional features that are configured through the nonvolatile\nconfiguration register for default and/or nonvolatile settings. Volatile settings can be\nconfigured through the volatile and volatile-enhanced configuration registers. These\nconfigurable features include the following:\n• Number of dummy cycles for the fast READ commands\n• Output buffer impedance\n• SPI protocol types (extended SPI, dual-SPI, or quad-SPI)\n• Required XIP mode\n• Enabling/disabling HOLD (RESET function)\n• Enabling/disabling wrap mode\nFigure 1: Logic Diagram\nVCC\nDQ0\nC\nS#\nVPP/W#/DQ2\nHOLD#/DQ3\nVSSDQ1\nNote: 1.

See Signal Assignments\nfor information specific to this device.\nTable 1: Signal Descriptions\nSymbol Type Description\nC Input Clock:  Provides the timing of the serial interface. Commands, addresses, or data present at se-\nrial data inputs are latched on the rising edge of the clock. Data is shifted out on the falling\nedge of the clock.\nS# Input Chip select:  When S# is HIGH, the device is deselected and DQ1 is at High-Z. When in exten-\nded SPI mode, with the device deselected, DQ1 is tri-stated. Unless an internal PROGRAM,\nERASE, or WRITE STATUS REGISTER cycle is in progress, the device enters standby power mode\n(not deep power-down mode). Driving S# LOW enables the device, placing it in the active pow-\ner mode. After power-up, a falling edge on S# is required prior to the start of any command.\nDQ0 Input\nand I/OSerial data:  Transfers data serially into the device. It receives command codes, addresses, and\nthe data to be programmed. Values are latched on the rising edge of the clock. DQ0 is used for\ninput/output during the following operations: DUAL OUTPUT FAST READ, QUAD OUTPUT FAST\nREAD, DUAL INPUT/OUTPUT FAST READ, and QUAD INPUT/OUTPUT FAST READ. When used for\noutput, data is shifted out on the falling edge of the clock.\nIn DIO-SPI, DQ0 always acts as an input/output.\nIn QIO-SPI, DQ0 always acts as an input/output, with the exception of the PROGRAM or ERASE\ncycle performed with V PP. The device temporarily enters the extended SPI protocol and then re-\nturns to QIO-SPI as soon as V PP goes LOW.\nDQ1 Output\nand I/OSerial data: Transfers data serially out of the device. Data is shifted out on the falling edge of\nthe clock. DQ1 is used for input/output during the following operations: DUAL INPUT FAST\nPROGRAM, QUAD INPUT FAST PROGRAM, DUAL INPUT EXTENDED FAST PROGRAM, and QUAD\nINPUT EXTENDED FAST PROGRAM. When used for input, data is latched on the rising edge of\nthe clock.\nIn DIO-SPI, DQ1 always acts as an input/output.\nIn QIO-SPI, DQ1 always acts as an input/output, with the exception of the PROGRAM or ERASE\ncycle performed with the enhanced program supply voltage (V PP). In this case the device tem-\nporarily enters the extended SPI protocol and then returns to QIO-SPI as soon as V PP goes LOW.\nDQ2 Input\nand I/ODQ2:  When in QIO-SPI mode or in extended SPI mode using QUAD FAST READ commands, the\nsignal functions as DQ2, providing input/output.\nAll data input drivers are always enabled except when used as an output. Micron recommends\ncustomers drive the data signals normally (to avoid unnecessary switching current) and float\nthe signals before the memory device drives data on them.\nDQ3 Input\nand I/ODQ3:  When in quad SPI mode or in extended SPI mode using quad FAST READ commands, the\nsignal functions as DQ3, providing input/output. HOLD# is disabled and RESET# is disabled if\nthe device is selected.\nRESET# Control\nInputRESET:  This is a hardware RESET# signal. When RESET# is driven HIGH, the memory is in the\nnormal operating mode. When RESET# is driven LOW, the memory enters reset mode and out-\nput is High-Z. If RESET# is driven LOW while an internal WRITE, PROGRAM, or ERASE operation\nis in progress, data may be lost.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nSignal Descriptions\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nTable 1: Signal Descriptions (Continued)\nSymbol Type Description\nHOLD# Control\nInputHOLD:  Pauses any serial communications with the device without deselecting the device. DQ1\n(output) is High-Z. DQ0 (input) and the clock are "Don\'t Care." To enable HOLD, the device\nmust be selected with S# driven LOW.\nHOLD# is used for input/output during the following operations: QUAD OUTPUT FAST READ,\nQUAD INPUT/OUTPUT FAST READ, QUAD INPUT FAST PROGRAM, and QUAD INPUT EXTENDED\nFAST PROGRAM.\nIn QIO-SPI, HOLD# acts as an I/O (DQ3 functionality), and the HOLD# functionality is disabled\nwhen the device is selected. When the device is deselected (S# is HIGH) in parts with RESET#\nfunctionality, it is possible to reset the device unless this functionality is not disabled by means\nof dedicated registers bits.\nThe HOLD# functionality can be disabled using bit 4 of the NVCR or bit 4 of the VECR.\nW# Control\nInputWrite protect:  W# can be used as a protection control input or in QIO-SPI operations. When in\nextended SPI with single or dual commands, the WRITE PROTECT function is selectable by the\nvoltage range applied to the signal. If voltage range is low (0V to V CC), the signal acts as a\nwrite protection control input. The memory size protected against PROGRAM or ERASE opera-\ntions is locked as specified in the status register block protect bits 3:0.\nW# is used as an input/output (DQ2 functionality) during QUAD INPUT FAST READ and QUAD\nINPUT/OUTPUT FAST READ operations and in QIO-SPI.\nVPP Power Supply voltage:  If V PP is in the voltage range of V PPH, the signal acts as an additional power\nsupply, as defined in the AC Measurement Conditions table.\nDuring QIFP, QIEFP, and QIO-SPI PROGRAM/ERASE operations, it is possible to use the addition-\nal V PP power supply to speed up internal operations. However, to enable this functionality, it is\nnecessary to set bit 3 of the VECR to 0.\nIn this case, V PP is used as an I/O until the end of the operation. After the last input data is shif-\nted in, the application should apply V PP voltage to V PP within 200ms to speed up the internal\noperations. If the V PP voltage is not applied within 200ms, the PROGRAM/ERASE operations\nstart at standard speed.\nThe default value of VECR bit 3 is 1, and the V PP functionality for quad I/O modify operations is\ndisabled.\nVCC Power Device core power supply:  Source voltage.\nVSS Ground Ground:  Reference for the V CC supply voltage.\nDNU – Do not use.\nNC – No connect.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nSignal Descriptions\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

The difference between the two modes is the clock\npolarity when the bus master is in standby mode and not transferring data. Input data is\nlatched in on the rising edge of the clock, and output data is available from the falling\nedge of the clock.\nTable 7: SPI Modes\nNote 1 applies to the entire table\nSPI Modes Clock Polarity\nCPOL = 0, CPHA = 0 C remains at 0 for (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)\nCPOL = 1, CPHA = 1 C remains at 1 for (CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1)\nNote: 1. The listed SPI modes are supported in extended, dual, and quad SPI protocols.\nShown below is an example of three memory devices in extended SPI protocol in a sim-\nple connection to an MCU on an SPI bus. Because only one device is selected at a time,\nthat one device drives DQ1, while the other devices are High-Z.\nResistors ensure the device is not selected if the bus master leaves S# High-Z. The bus\nmaster might enter a state in which all input/output is High-Z simultaneously, such as\nwhen the bus master is reset. Therefore, the serial clock must be connected to an exter-\nnal pull-down resistor so that S# is pulled HIGH while the serial clock is pulled LOW.\nThis ensures that S# and the serial clock are not HIGH simultaneously and that tSHCH\nis met. The typical resistor value of 100k Ω, assuming that the time constant R × Cp (Cp =\nparasitic capacitance of the bus line), is shorter than the time the bus master leaves the\nSPI bus in High-Z.\nExample:  Cp = 50pF , that is R × Cp = 5μs. The application must ensure that the bus mas-\nter never leaves the SPI bus High-Z for a time period shorter than 5μs. W# and HOLD#\nshould be driven either HIGH or LOW, as appropriate.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nSerial Peripheral Interface Modes\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

The device returns to the default protocol after\nthe next power-on. In addition, the device can return to de-\nfault protocol using the rescue sequence or through new\nWRITE ENHANCED VOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER\ncommand, without power-off or power-on.\nNonvolatile selectable:  When nonvolatile configuration\nregister bit 2 is set, the device enters the dual SPI protocol\nafter the next power-on. Once this register bit is set, the de-\nvice defaults to the dual SPI protocol after all subsequent\npower-on sequences until the nonvolatile configuration\nregister bit is reset to 1.\nQuad1DQ[3:0] DQ[3:0] DQ[3:0] Volatile selectable:  When the enhanced volatile configu-\nration register bit 7 is set to 0, the device enters the quad\nSPI protocol immediately after the WRITE ENHANCED VOL-\nATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command. The device re-\nturns to the default protocol after the next power-on. In ad-\ndition, the device can return to default protocol using the\nrescue sequence or through new WRITE ENHANCED VOLA-\nTILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command, without power-\noff or power-on.\nNonvolatile selectable: When nonvolatile configuration\nregister bit 3 is set to 0, the device enters the quad SPI pro-\ntocol after the next power-on. Once this register bit is set,\nthe device defaults to the quad SPI protocol after all subse-\nquent power-on sequences until the nonvolatile configura-\ntion register bit is reset to 1.\nNote: 1. In quad SPI protocol, all command/address input and data I/O are transmitted on four\nlines except during a PROGRAM and ERASE cycle performed with V PP. In this case, the\ndevice enters the extended SPI protocol to temporarily allow the application to perform\na PROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND operation or to check the write-in-progress bit in the sta-\ntus register or the program/erase controller bit in the flag status register. Then, when\nVPP goes LOW, the device returns to the quad SPI protocol.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nSPI Protocols\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

As shown be-\nlow, parameters in the internal configuration register are loaded from the nonvolatile\nconfiguration register during each device boot phase or power-on reset. In this sense,\nthen, the nonvolatile configuration register contains the default settings of memory.\nAlso, during the life of an application, each time a WRITE VOLATILE or ENHANCED\nVOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command executes to set configuration pa-\nrameters in these respective registers, these new settings are copied to the internal con-\nfiguration register. Therefore, memory settings can be changed in real time. However, at\nthe next power-on reset, the memory boots according to the memory settings defined\nin the nonvolatile configuration register parameters.\nFigure 8: Internal Configuration Register\nRegister download is executed only during\nthe power-on phase or after a reset,\noverwriting configuration register settings\non the internal configuration register.Register download is executed after a\nWRITE VOLATILE OR ENHANCED VOLATILE\nCONFIGURATION REGISTER command,\noverwriting configuration register\nsettings on the internal configuration register.Nonvolatile configuration register\nInternal configuration\nregister\nDevice behaviorVolatile configuration register and\nenhanced volatile configuration register32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nNonvolatile and Volatile Registers\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

The only way to exit this hardware-protected mode is to drive\nW#/V PP HIGH.\n3. See Protected Area Sizes tables in Device Protection.

The device outputs the information starting from the specified address. When\nthe 2048-byte boundary is reached, the data output wraps to address 0 of the serial\nFlash discovery parameter table. The operation is terminated by driving S# HIGH at any\ntime during data output.\nThe operation always executes in continuous mode so the read burst wrap setting in the\nvolatile configuration register does not apply.\nNote:  Data to be stored in the serial Flash discovery parameter area is still in the defini-\ntion phase.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nREAD IDENTIFICATION Operations\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

S# is then driven LOW and held LOW until the eighth\nbit of the last data byte has been latched in, after which it must be driven HIGH. The\ncommand code is input on DQ0, followed by input on DQ[n] of address bytes and at\nleast one data byte. Each address bit is latched in during the rising edge of the clock.\nWhen S# is driven HIGH, the operation, which is self-timed, is initiated; its duration is\ntPP .\nIf the bits of the least significant address, which is the starting address, are not all zero,\nall data transmitted beyond the end of the current page is programmed from the start-\ning address of the same page. If the number of bytes sent to the device exceed the maxi-\nmum page size, previously latched data is discarded and only the last maximum page-\nsize number of data bytes are guaranteed to be programmed correctly within the same\npage. If the number of bytes sent to the device is less than the maximum page size, they\nare correctly programmed at the specified addresses without any effect on the other\nbytes of the same page.\nWhen the operation is in progress, the write in progress bit is set to 1. The write enable\nlatch bit is cleared to 0, whether the operation is successful or not. The status register\nand flag status register can be polled for the operation status. An operation can be\npaused or resumed by the PROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND or PROGRAM/ERASE RESUME\ncommand, respectively. When the operation completes, the write in progress bit is\ncleared to 0.\nIf the operation times out, the write enable latch bit is reset and the program fail bit is\nset to 1. If S# is not driven HIGH, the command is not executed, flag status register error\nbits are not set, and the write enable latch remains set to 1. When a command is applied\nto a protected sector, the command is not executed, the write enable latch bit remains\nset to 1, and flag status register bits 1 and 4 are set.\nTable 24: Data/Address Lines for PROGRAM Commands\nNote 1 applies to entire table\nCommand Name Data In Address In Extended Dual Quad\nPAGE PROGRAM DQ0 DQ0 Yes Yes Yes\nDUAL INPUT FAST PROGRAM DQ[1:0] DQ0 Yes Yes No\nEXTENDED DUAL INPUT\nFAST PROGRAMDQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] Yes Yes No\nQUAD INPUT FAST PROGRAM DQ[3:0] DQ0 Yes No Yes\nEXTENDED QUAD INPUT\nFAST PROGRAMDQ[3:0] DQ[3:0] Yes No Yes\nNote: 1.Yes in the protocol columns indicates that the command is supported and has the same\nfunctionality and command sequence as other commands marked Yes.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nPROGRAM Operations\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

The com-\nmand code is input on DQ0. The operation is terminated by the PROGRAM/ERASE RE-\nSUME command.\nPROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND command enables the memory controller to interrupt\nand suspend an array PROGRAM or ERASE operation within the program/erase latency.\nIf a SUSPEND command is issued during a PROGRAM operation, then the flag status\nregister bit 2 is set to 1. After erase/program latency time, the flag status register bit 7 is\nalso set to 1, showing the device to be in a suspended state, waiting for any operation\n(see the Operations Allowed/Disallowed During Device States table).\nIf a SUSPEND command is issued during an ERASE operation, then the flag status regis-\nter bit 6 is set to 1. After erase/program latency time, the flag status register bit 7 is also\nset to 1, showing that device to be in a suspended state, waiting for any operation (see\nthe Operations Allowed/Disallowed During Device States table).\nIf the time remaining to complete the operation is less than the suspend latency, the de-\nvice completes the operation and clears the flag status register bits 2 or 6, as applicable.\nBecause the suspend state is volatile, if there is a power cycle, the suspend state infor-\nmation is lost and the flag status register powers up as 80h.\nDuring an ERASE SUSPEND operation, a PROGRAM or READ operation is possible in\nany sector except the one in a suspended state. Reading from a sector that is in a sus-\npended state will output indeterminate data. The device ignores a PROGRAM com-\nmand to a sector that is in an ERASE SUSPEND state; it also sets the flag status register\nbit 4 to 1: program failure/protection error, and leaves the write enable latch bit un-\nchanged. The commands allowed during an erase suspend state include the WRITE\nLOCK REGISTER command, the WRITE VOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER com-\nmand, and the WRITE ENHANCED VOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nERASE Operations\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

Issue an ERASE command and suspend it. Then\nissue a PROGRAM command and suspend it also. With the two operations suspended,\nthe next PROGRAM/ERASE RESUME command resumes the latter operation, and a sec-\nond PROGRAM/ERASE RESUME command resumes the former (or first) operation.\nTable 25: Operations Allowed/Disallowed During Device States\nNote 1 applies to entire table\nOperationStandby\nStateProgram or\nErase StateSubsector Erase Suspend or\nProgram Suspend StateErase Suspend\nState Notes\nREAD Yes No Yes Yes 2\nPROGRAM Yes No No Yes/No 3\nERASE Yes No No No 4\nWRITE Yes No No No 5\nWRITE Yes No Yes Yes 6\nREAD Yes Yes Yes Yes 7\nSUSPEND No Yes No No 8\nNotes: 1.

The command code is in-\nput on DQ0, followed by three bytes and dummy clock cycles. Each address bit is latch-\ned in during the rising edge of C. Data is shifted out on DQ1, beginning from the speci-\nfied address and at a maximum frequency of fC (MAX) on the falling edge of the clock.\nThe address increments automatically to the next address after each byte of data is shif-\nted out. There is no rollover mechanism; therefore, if read continuously, after location\n40h, the device continues to output data at location 40h. The operation is terminated by\ndriving S# HIGH at any time during data output.\nFigure 28: READ OTP Command\n7 8 Cx0\nC\nMSBDQ0LSB\nCommand\nA[MAX]A[MIN]\n3 4 Cx0\nC\nMSBDQ[1:0]LSB\nCommand\nA[MAX]A[MIN]\nMSBDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTLSB\nDummy cycles\n1 2 Cx0\nC\nMSBDQ[3:0]LSB\nCommand\nA[MAX]A[MIN]\nMSBDOUTDOUTDOUTLSB\nDummy cyclesExtended\nMSBDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTLSB\nDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUT\nDummy cyclesDual\nQuadDQ1 High-Z\nDon’t Care\nNote: 1.

XIP mode offers maximum flexibility to the application,\nsaves instruction overhead, and reduces random access time.\nActivate or Terminate XIP Using Volatile Configuration Register\nApplications that boot in SPI and must switch to XIP use the volatile configuration reg-\nister. XIP provides faster memory READ operations by requiring only an address to exe-\ncute, rather than a command code and an address.\nTo activate XIP requires two steps. First, enable XIP by setting volatile configuration reg-\nister bit 3 to 0. Next, drive the XIP confirmation bit to 0 during the next FAST READ op-\neration. XIP is then active. Once in XIP , any command that occurs after S# is toggled re-\nquires only address bits to execute; a command code is not necessary, and device oper-\nations use the SPI protocol that is enabled. XIP is terminated by driving the XIP confir-\nmation bit to 1. The device automatically resets volatile configuration register bit 3 to 1.\nNote:  For devices with basic XIP , indicated by a part number feature set digit of 2 or 4, it\nis not necessary to set the volatile configuration register bit 3 to 0 to enable XIP . Instead,\nit is enabled by setting the XIP confirmation bit to 0 during the first dummy clock cycle\nafter any FAST READ command.\nActivate or Terminate XIP Using Nonvolatile Configuration Register\nApplications that must boot directly in XIP use the nonvolatile configuration register. To\nenable a device to power-up in XIP using the nonvolatile configuration register, set non-\nvolatile configuration register bits [11:9]. Settings vary according to protocol, as ex-\nplained in the Nonvolatile Configuration Register section. Because the device boots di-\nrectly in XIP , the confirmation bit is already set to 0, and after the next power cycle, XIP\nis active. Once in XIP , a command code is unnecessary, and device operations use the\nSPI protocol currently enabled. XIP is terminated by driving the XIP confirmation bit to\n1.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nXIP Mode\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

This bit is the value on DQ0 during the first dummy clock cycle in the FAST\nREAD operation. XIP requires at least one additional clock cycle to send the XIP confir-\nmation bit to the memory on DQ0 during the first dummy clock cycle.\nTable 27: XIP Confirmation Bit\nBit Value Description\n0 Activates XIP: While this bit is 0, XIP remains activated.\n1 Terminates XIP: When this bit is set to 1, XIP is terminated and the device returns to SPI.\nTable 28: Effects of Running XIP in Different Protocols\nProtocol Effect Notes\nExtended I/O,\nDual I/OIn a device with a dedicated part number where RST# is enabled, a LOW pulse on RST#\nresets XIP and the device to the state it was in previous to the last power-up, as defined\nby the nonvolatile configuration register. \nDual I/O Values of DQ1 during the first dummy clock cycle are "Don\'t Care."  \nQuad I/O Values of DQ[3:1] during the first dummy clock cycle are "Don\'t Care."\nIn a device with a dedicated part number where RST# is enabled, a LOW pulse on RST#\nresets XIP and the device to the state it was in previous to the last power-up, as defined\nby the nonvolatile configuration register.1\nNote: 1.

All rights reserved.\nTerminating XIP After a Controller and Memory Reset\nThe system controller and the device can become out of synchronization if, during the\nlife of the application, the system controller is reset without the device being reset. In\nsuch a case, the controller can reset the memory to power-on reset if the memory has\nreset functionality. (Reset is available in devices with a dedicated part number.)\nIf reset functionality is not available, has been disabled, or is not supported by the con-\ntroller, the controller must execute the following sequence to terminate XIP in the\nmemory device. In quad I/O protocol, drive DQ0 = 1 with S# held LOW for seven clock\ncycles; S# must driven HIGH before the eighth clock cycle. In dual I/O protocol, drive\nDQ0 = 1 with S# held LOW for 13 clock cycles; S# must driven HIGH before the four-\nteenth clock cycle. If the device is in extended protocol, drive DQ0 = 1 with S# held LOW\nfor 25 clock cycles; S# must driven HIGH before the twenty-sixth clock cycle.\nThese sequences cause the controller to set the XIP confirmation bit to 1, thereby termi-\nnating XIP . However, it does not reset the device or interrupt PROGRAM/ERASE opera-\ntions that may be in progress.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nXIP Mode\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nPower-Up and Power-Down\nPower-Up and Power-Down Requirements\nAt power-up and power-down, the device must not be selected; that is, S# must follow\nthe voltage applied on V CC until V CC reaches the correct values: V CC,min  at power-up and\nVSS at power-down.\nTo avoid data corruption and inadvertent WRITE operations during power-up, a power-\non reset circuit is included. The logic inside the device is held to RESET while V CC is less\nthan the power-on reset threshold voltage shown here; all operations are disabled, and\nthe device does not respond to any instruction. During a standard power-up phase, the\ndevice ignores all commands except READ STATUS REGISTER and READ FLAG STATUS\nREGISTER. These operations can be used to check the memory internal state. After\npower-up, the device is in standby power mode; the write enable latch bit is reset; the\nwrite in progress bit is reset; and the lock registers are configured as: (write lock bit, lock\ndown bit) = (0,0).\nNormal precautions must be taken for supply line decoupling to stabilize the V CC sup-\nply. Each device in a system should have the V CC line decoupled by a suitable capacitor\n(typically 100nF) close to the package pins. At power-down, when V CC drops from the\noperating voltage to below the power-on-reset threshold voltage shown here, all opera-\ntions are disabled and the device does not respond to any command.\nNote: If power-down occurs while a WRITE, PROGRAM, or ERASE cycle is in pro-\ngress, data corruption may result.\nVPPH must be applied only when V CC is stable and in the V CC,min  to V CC,max  voltage\nrange.\nFigure 31: Power-Up Timing\nVCC\nVCC,min\nVWIChip\nresetChip selection not allowed\nPolling allowedtVTW = tVTR\nTimeDevice fully accessibleVCC,max\nSPI protocol Starting protocol\ndefined by NVCR\nWIP = 1\nWEL = 0WIP = 0\nWEL = 032Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nPower-Up and Power-Down\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.

If this happens, until the next power-up, a res-\ncue sequence must reset the device to a fixed state (extended SPI protocol without XIP).\nAfter the rescue sequence, the issue should be resolved by running the WRITE NONVO-\nLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command again. The rescue sequence is com-\nposed of two parts that must be run in the correct order. During the entire sequence,\ntSHSL2 must be at least 50ns. The first part of the sequence is DQ0 (PAD DATA) and\nDQ3 (PAD HOLD) equal to 1 for the situations listed below:\n• 7 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 8th clock cycle)\n• + 13 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 14th clock cycle)\n• + 25 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 26th clock cycle)\nThe second part of the sequence is exiting from dual or quad SPI protocol by using the\nfollowing FFh sequence: DQ0 and DQ3 equal to 1 for 8 clock cycles within S# LOW; S#\nbecomes HIGH before 9th clock cycle.\nAfter this two-part sequence the extended SPI protocol is active.32Mb, 3V, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nPower-Up and Power-Down\nCCMTD-1725822587-8448\nn25q_32mb_3v_65nm.pdf - Rev.
