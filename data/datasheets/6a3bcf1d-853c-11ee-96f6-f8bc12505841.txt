The on-chip low noise instrumentation amplifier means that signals of small amplitude can be \ninterfaced directly to the ADC.  \nEach device contains a precision, low noise, low drift internal \nband gap reference, and can also accept up to two external \ndifferential references. Other on-chip features include \nprogrammable excitation current sources, burnout currents, and a bias voltage generator that is used to set the common-mode voltage of a channel to AV\nDD/2. The low-side power \nswitch can be used to power down bridge sensors between \nconversions, minimizing the system’s power consumption. The \nAD7794/AD7795 can operate with either an internal clock or an external clock. The output data rate from each part can vary \nfrom 4.17 Hz to 470 Hz.  \nBoth parts operate with a power supply from 2.7 V to 5.25 V . \nThe B-grade parts (AD7794 and AD7795) are specified for a temperature range of −40°C to +105°C while the C-grade part \n(AD7794) is specified for a temperature range of −40°C to \n+125°C. They consume a current of 400 μA typical and are \nhoused in a 24-lead TSSOP . \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM \n04854-001DOUT/RD Y\nDIN\nSCLK\nCS\nDVDDSERIAL\nINTERFACE\nAND\nLOGIC\nCONTROLΣ-Δ\nADC\nAD7794: 24-BIT ADC\nAD7795: 16-BIT ADCAD7794/AD7795AIN1(+)\nAIN1(–)\nAIN2(+)\nAIN2(–)\nAIN3(+)\nAIN3(–)\nAIN5(+)/IOUT2\nAIN5(–)/IOUT1\nAIN6(+)/P1\nAIN6(–)/P2VDD\nGNDMUXVBIAS\nPSW\nGNDBAND GAP\nREFERENCE\nTEMP\nSENSOR\nCLKINTERNAL\nCLOCKGNDREFERENCE\nDETECTGND AVDD AIN4(+) /REFIN2(+) REFIN1(+) AIN4(–)/REFIN2( –)REFIN1( –)\nVDDIN-AMP BUF\n \nFigure 1.\nAD7794/AD7795  \n \nRev.

At the 19.6 Hz and 39.2  Hz update rates, the INL, power  supply rejection (PSR), common-\nmode rejection (CMR), and normal mode rejection (NMR) do not meet the data sheet specification if the voltage on the AIN(+) or AIN(−) pins exceeds AV DD – 1.6 V \ntypically. In addition, the offset error and offset error drift degrade at these update rates when chopping is disabled. When t his voltage is exceeded, the INL, for \nexample, is reduced to 18 ppm of FS typically while the PSR is reduced to 69 dB typically. Therefore, for guaranteed performanc e at these update rates, the absolute \nvoltage on the analog input pins needs to be below AVDD − 1.6 V. \n2 Specification is not production tested but is supported  by characterization data at initial product release. \n3 Following a calibration, this error is in the order of the noise for the programmed gain an d update rate selected. \n4 Recalibration at any temper ature removes these errors. \n5 Full-scale error applies to both positive and negative full -scale, and applies at the factory calibration conditions (AV DD = 4 V, gain = 1, T A = 25°C). \n6 FS[3:0] are the four bits used in the mode register to select the output word rate. \n7 Digital inputs equal to DV DD or GND with excitation currents an d bias voltage generator disabled. \n \nAD7794/AD7795 \n \nRev.

Pin Configuration \nTable 4. Pin Function Descriptions \nPin No. Mnemonic  Description \n1  SCLK  Serial Clock Input. This serial cloc k input is for data transfers to and from the ADC. The SCLK has a Schmitt-\ntriggered input, making the interface suitable for opto-isolated applications. The serial clock can be \ncontinuous with all data transmitted in a continuous train of pulses. Alternatively, it can be a noncontinuous \nclock with the information being transmitted to or from the ADC in smaller batches of data.  \n2  CLK  Clock In/Clock Out. The internal clock can be made available at this pin. Alternatively, the internal clock can \nbe disabled, and the ADC can be driven by an external clock. This allows several AD Cs to be driven from a \ncommon clock, allowing simultaneous conversions to be performed.  \n3  CS Chip Select Input. This is an active low logic input used to select the ADC. CS can be used to select the ADC in \nsystems with more than one device on the serial bus or as a frame synchronization signal in communicating \nwith the device.

AIN3(−) is th e negative terminal of the differential  analog input pair, AIN3(+)/AIN3(−).  \n13  REFIN1(+)  Positive Reference Input. An external reference can be applied between REFIN1(+) and REFIN1(−). REFIN1(+) \ncan lie anywhere between AV DD and GND + 0.1 V. The nominal reference voltage, (REFIN1(+) − REFIN1(−)), is \n2.5 V, but the part functions with a reference from 0.1 V to AV DD.  \n14  REFIN1(−)  Negative Reference Input.

REFIN2(+) can lie anywhere between AV\nDD and GND + 0.1 V.

DV DD is independent of AV DD. Therefore, the serial interface \noperates at 3 V with AV DD at 5 V or vice versa.  \n23  DOUT/ RDY Serial Data Output/Data  Ready Output. DOUT/ RDY  serves a dual purpose. It functions as a serial data output \npin to access the output shift register of the ADC. The o utput shift register can contain data from any of the \non-chip data or control registers. In addition, DOUT/ RDY  operates as a data ready pin, going low to indicate \nthe completion of a conversion. If the data is not re ad after the conversion, the pin goes high before the \nnext update occurs. The DOUT/ RDY  falling edge can also be used as an  interrupt to a processor, indicating \nthat valid data is available. With an external se rial clock, the data can be read using the DOUT/ RDY  pin. With \nCS low, the data/control word info rmation is placed on the DOUT/ RDY  pin on the SCLK falling edge and is \nvalid on the SCLK rising edge. \n24  DIN  Serial Data Input to the Input Shift Register on the ADC. Data in this shift register is transferred to the control \nregisters within the ADC with the register selection bits of the communications register identifying the \nappropriate register.  \n \n  AD7794/AD7795\n \nRev. D | Page 13 of 36 RMS NOISE AND RESOLUTION SPECIFICATIONS \nThe AD7794/AD7795 can be operated with chop enabled or \nchop disabled, allowing the ADC to be optimized for switching \ntime or drift performance. With chop enabled, the settling time \nis two times the conversion time. However, the offset is continuously removed by the ADC leading to low offset and low offset drift. With chop disabled, the allowable update rates are the same as in chop enable mode. However, the settling time now equals the conversion time. With chop disabled, the offset \nis not removed by the ADC, so periodic offset calibrations can \nbe required to remove offset due to drift.

D | Page 17 of 36 ON-CHIP REGISTERS \nThe ADC is controlled and configured via a number of on-chip \nregisters that are described in the following sections. In the \nfollowing descriptions, set implies a Logic 1 state and cleared  \nimplies a Logic 0 state, unless otherwise noted.  \nCOMMUNICATIONS REGISTER \nRS2, RS1, RS0 = 0, 0, 0  \nThe communications register is an 8-bit write-only register. All \ncommunications to the part must start with a write operation to \nthe communications register. The data written to the communi-\ncations register determines whether the next operation is a read \nor write operation, and to which register this operation takes place. For read or write operations, once the subsequent read or write operation to the selected register is complete, the interface returns to where it expects a write operation to the communications register. This is the default state of the interface and, on power-up or after a reset, the ADC is in this default state waiting for a write operation to the communications \nregister. In situations where the interface sequence is lost, a \nwrite operation of at least 32 serial clock cycles with DIN high returns the ADC to this default state by resetting the entire part. \nTable 14  outlines the bit designations for the communications \nregister. CR0 through CR7 indicate the bit location, with CR \ndenoting the bits are in the communications register. CR7 \ndenotes the first bit of the data stream. The number in brackets \nindicates the power-on/reset default status of that bit.  \n \n \nCR7  CR6  CR5  CR4  CR3  CR2  CR1  CR0  \nWEN (0)  R/W(0)  RS2(0)  RS1(0)  RS0(0)  CREAD(0)  0(0)  0(0)  \n \nTable 14. Communications Register Bit Designations \nBit No.  Mnemonic  Description  \nCR7  WEN Write Enable Bit. A 0 must be written to this bit so that  the write to the communication s register actually occurs. If \na 1 is the first bit written, the part does not clock on to su bsequent bits in the register. It stays at this bit location \nuntil a 0 is written to this bit. Once a 0 is written to the WEN  bit, the next seven bits are loaded to the \ncommunications register.  \nCR6  R/W A 0 in this bit location indicates that the next operatio n is a write to a specified register. A 1 in this position \nindicates that the next operation is a read from the designated register.  \nCR5 to \nCR3  RS2 to RS0  Register Address Bits. These address bits are used to sele ct which registers of the ADC are being selected during \nthis serial interface communication. See Table 15 .  \nCR2  CREAD  Continuous Read of the Data Register. When this bit is se t to 1 (and the data register  is selected), the serial \ninterface is configured so that the data register can be re ad continuously, that is, the contents of the data register \nare automatically placed on the DOUT pin when the SCLK pulses are applied after the RDY  pin goes low to \nindicate that a conversion is complete. The communications register does not have to be written to for data reads. To enable continuous read mode, the instruction 01011100 must be written to the communications register. To \nexit the continuous read mode, the instruction 01011000 mu st be written to the communications register while \nthe \nRDY  pin is low. While in continuous read mode, the ADC mo nitors activity on the DIN line so it can receive the \ninstruction to exit continuous read mode. Additionally, a reset occurs if 32 consecutive 1s are seen on DIN. \nTherefore, DIN should be held low in continuous read mode until an instruction is written to the device.  \nCR1 to CR0  0  These bits must be programmed to Logic 0 for correct operation.  \n \nTable 15.

To access the \nADC status register, the user must write to the communications \nregister, select the next operation to be read, and load Bit RS2, \nBit RS1, and Bit RS0 with 0.  \nTable 16  outlines the bit designations for the status register. SR0 \nthrough SR7 indicate the bit locations, with SR denoting that \nthe bits are in the status register. SR7 denotes the first bit of the \ndata stream.

Status Register Bit Designations \nBit No.  Mnemonic Description  \nSR7  RDY Ready Bit for ADC. Cleared  when data is written to the ADC data register. The RDY  bit is set automatically after the \nADC data register has been read or a period of time be fore the data register is updated with a new conversion \nresult to indicate to the user not to read the conversion da ta. It is also set when the pa rt is placed in power-down \nmode. The end of a conversion is also indicated by the DOUT/ RDY  pin. This pin can be used as an alternative to the \nstatus register for monitoring the ADC for conversion data.  \nSR6  ERR  ADC Error Bit. This bit is written to at the same time as the RDY  bit. Set to indicate that the result written to the \nADC data register has been clamped to all 0s or all 1s. Error sources include overrange, underrange, or the absence \nof a reference voltage. Cleared  by a write operation to start a conversion.  \nSR5  NOXREF  No External Reference Bit. Set to indicate that the selected reference (REFIN1 or REFIN2) is at a voltage that is \nbelow a specified threshold. When set, conversion results are clamped to all 1s. Cleared  to indicate that a valid \nreference is applied to the selected reference pins. The NOXREF bit is enabled by setting the REF_DET bit in the \nconfiguration register to 1. The ERR bit is also set if the voltage applied to the selected reference input is invalid. \nSR4  0  This bit is automatically cleared .  \nSR3  0/1  This bit is automatically cleared  on the AD7795 and is automatically set on the AD7794. \nSR2 to SR0  CH2 to CH0  These bits indicate which channel is being converted by the ADC.  \n \n  AD7794/AD7795\n \nRev.

MR15 is the first \nbit of the data stream. The number in parentheses indicates the power-on/reset default status of that bit. Any write to the setup \nregister resets the modulator and filter, and sets the \nRDY  bit. \nMR15  MR14  MR13  MR12  MR11  MR10  MR9  MR8  \nMD2(0)  MD1(0)  MD0(0)  PSW(0)  0(0)  0(0)  AMP-CM(0)  0(0)  \nMR7 MR6 MR5 MR4 MR3 MR2 MR1 MR0 \nCLK1(0)  CLK0(0)  0(0)  CHOP-DIS(0)  FS3(1)  FS2(0)  FS1(1)  FS0(0)  \n \nTable 17.

These bits select the operating mode of the AD7794/AD7795 (see Table 18 ). \nMR12  PSW  Power Switch Control Bit. Set  by user to close the power switch PSW to GND. The power switch can sink \nup to 30 mA. Cleared  by user to open the power switch. When the ADC is placed in power-down mode, \nthe power switch is opened. \nMR11 to MR10  0  These bits must be programmed with a Logic 0 for correct operation.  \nMR9 AMP-CM Instrumentation Amplifier Common-Mode Bit. This bit is  used in conjunction with the CHOP-DIS bit. With \nchop disabled, the user can operate with a wider range of common-mode voltages when AMP-CM is \ncleared. However, the dc common-mode rejection de grades. With AMP-CM set, the span for the common-\nmode voltage is reduced (see the Specifications  section). However, the dc common-mode rejection is \nsignificantly better. \nMR8 0 This bit must be programmed with a Logic 0 for correct operation. \nMR7 to MR6  CLK1 to CLK0  These bits are used to select the clock source fo r the AD7794/AD7795. Either the on-chip 64 kHz clock can \nbe used or an external clock can be used. The abili ty to use an external clock allows several AD7794/AD7795 \ndevices to be synchronized. Also, 50 Hz/60 Hz reject ion is improved when an accurate external clock \ndrives the AD7794/AD7795.  \n  CLK1  CLK0  ADC Clock Source  \n  0  0  Internal 64 kHz clock. Internal clock is not available at the CLK pin.  \n  0  1  Internal 64 kHz clock. This clock is made available at the CLK pin.  \n  1  0  External 64 kHz. The external clock can have a 45:55 duty cycle (see the \nSpecifications  section for the external clock). \n  1  1  External clock. The external cl ock is divided by 2 within the AD7794/AD7795.  \nMR5  0  This bit must be programmed with a Logic 0 for correct operation. \nMR4  CHOP-DIS  This bit is used to enable or disable chop. On power-up or following a reset, CHOP-DIS is cleared  so chop is \nenabled. When CHOP-DIS is set, chop is disabled. This bit is used in conjunction with the AMP-CM bit. \nWhen chop is disabled, the AMP-CM bit should be set. This limits the common-mode voltage that can be \nused by the ADC, but the dc common- mode rejection does not degrade. \nMR3 to MR0  FS3 to FS0  Filter Update Rate Select Bits (see Table 19 ). \n \nAD7794/AD7795 \n \nRev. D | Page 20 of 36 Table 18. Operating Modes \nMD2  MD1  MD0  Mode  \n0  0  0  Continuous Conversion Mode (Default). \n   In continuous conversion mode, the ADC continuously pe rforms conversions and places the result in the data \nregister. RDY  goes low when a conversion is complete. The user can read these conversions by placing the device \nin continuous read mode whereby the conversions are automatically placed on the DOUT line when SCLK pulses \nare applied. Alternatively, the user can instruct the AD C to output the conversion by writing to the communica-\ntions register. After power-on, the first conversion is available after a period of 2/f ADC when chop is enabled or \n1/f ADC when chop is disabled. Subsequent conversions are available at a frequency of f ADC with chop either \nenabled or disabled. \n0  0  1  Single Conversion Mode.  \n   When single conversion mode is selected, the ADC powers up and performs a single conversion. The oscillator requires 1 ms to power up and settle. The ADC then performs the conversion, which takes a time of 2/f\nADC when \nchop is enabled, or 1/f ADC when chop is disabled. The conversion result is placed in the data register, RDY  goes \nlow, and the ADC returns to power-down mode. The conversion remains in the data register and RDY  remains \nactive (low) until the data is read or another conversion is performed. \n0  1  0  Idle Mode. \n   In idle mode, the ADC filter and modulator are held in a reset state although the modulator clocks are still \nprovided. \n0  1  1  Power-Down Mode. \n   In power-down mode, all the AD7794/AD7795 circuitry is powered down including the current sources, power \nswitch, burnout currents, bias voltage generator, and clock circuitry. \n1  0  0  Internal Zero-Scale Calibration. \n   An internal short is automatically connected to the enable d channel. A calibration takes two conversion cycles to \ncomplete when chop is enabled and one conversion cycle when chop is disabled. RDY  goes high when the \ncalibration is initiated and returns low when the calibratio n is complete. The ADC is placed in idle mode following \na calibration. The measured offset coefficient is placed in the offset register of the selected channel. \n1  0  1  Internal Full-Scale Calibration.  \n   A full-scale input voltage is automatically connected to the selected analog input for this calibration.  \n   When the gain equals 1, a calibration takes two conversion cycles to complete when chop is enabled and one conversion cycle when chop is disabled. \n   For higher gains, four conversion cycles are required to perform the full-scale calibration when chop is enabled and 2 conversion cycles when chop is disabled.  \n   RDY  goes high when the calibration is initiated and retur ns low when the calibration is complete. The ADC is \nplaced in idle mode following a calibration. The measured full-scale coefficient is placed in the full-scale register \nof the selected channel.  \n   Internal full-scale calibrations cannot be performed when the gain equals 128. With th is gain setting, a system \nfull-scale calibration can be performed. A full-scale calibration is required each time the gain of a channel is changed to minimize the full-scale error. \n1  1  0  System Zero-Scale Calibration. \n   User should connect the system zero-scale input to the ch annel input pins as selected by the CH2 bit, CH1 bit, \nand CH0 bit. A system offset calibration takes two conversion cycles to complete when chop is enabled and one conversion cycle when chop is disabled. \nRDY  goes high when the calibration is initiated and returns low when \nthe calibration is complete. The ADC is placed in idle mo de following a calibration. The measured offset coeffi-\ncient is placed in the offset register of the selected channel. \n1  1  1  System Full-Scale Calibration.  \n   User should connect the system full-scale input to the channe l input pins as selected by the CH2 bit, CH1 bit, and  \nCH0 bit. \n   A calibration takes two conversion cycles to complete when chop is enabled and one conversion cycle when \nchop is disabled.

The offset register holds the offset \ncalibration coefficient for the ADC and its power-on reset value is 0x8000/0x800000, for the AD7794/AD7795, respectively. The AD7794/AD7795 each have four offset registers. Channel AIN1 to Channel AIN3 have dedicated offset registers while the \nAIN4, AIN5, and AIN6 channels share an offset register. Each \nof these registers is a read/write register. The register is used in conjunction with its associated full-scale register to form a register pair. The power-on reset value is automatically \noverwritten if an internal or system zero-scale calibration is \ninitiated by the user.

The AIN1, AIN2, and AIN3 channels have dedicated full-scale registers, while the AIN4, AIN5, and AIN6 channels share a register. The full-scale \nregisters are read/write registers. However, when writing to the \nfull-scale registers, the ADC must be placed in power-down mode or idle mode. These registers are configured on power-on with factory calibrated full-scale calibration coefficients, the \ncalibration being performed at gain = 1. Therefore, every device \nhas different default coefficients. The coefficients are different, \ndepending on whether the internal reference or an external \nreference is selected. The default value is automatically overwritten if an internal or system full-scale calibration is \ninitiated by the user or the full-scale register is written to.\n \nAD7794/AD7795 \n \nRev. D | Page 26 of 36 ADC CIRCUIT INFORMATION  \nOVERVIEW  \nThe AD7794/AD7795 are low power ADCs that incorporate a \n∑-Δ modulator, buffer, reference, in-amp, and on-chip digital \nfiltering, which are intended for the measurement of wide dynamic range, low frequency signals (such as those in pressure \ntransducers), weigh scales, and temperature measurement \napplications.  \nEach part has six differential inputs that can be buffered or \nunbuffered. The devices operate with an internal 1.17 V refer-ence or by using an external reference. \nFigure 12  shows the \nbasic connections required to operate the parts.  \nThe output rate of the AD7794/AD7795 (f ADC) is user pro-\ngrammable. The allowable update rates, along with the corresponding settling times, are listed in \nTable 19  for chop \nenabled. With chop disabled, the allowable update rates remain unchanged, but the settling time equals 1/f\nADC. Normal mode \nrejection is the major function of the digital filter. Simultaneous 50 Hz and 60 Hz rejection is optimized when the update rate equals 16.7 Hz or less, as notches are placed at both 50 Hz and \n60 Hz with these update rates (see \nFigure 14 ).  \nThe AD7794/AD7795 use slightly different filter types, \ndepending on the output update rate, so that the rejection of quantization noise and device noise is optimized. When the \nupdate rate is 4.17 Hz to 12.5 Hz, a Sinc3 filter along with an \naveraging filter is used. When the update rate is 16.7 Hz to 39 Hz, a modified Sinc3 filter is used. This filter gives simultaneous 50 Hz/60 Hz rejection when the update rate equals 16.7 Hz. A Sinc4 filter is used when the update rate is \n50 Hz to 242 Hz. Finally, an integrate-only filter is used when \nthe update rate equals 470 Hz. Figure 13  to Figure 16  show the \nfrequency response of the different filter types for some of the update rates when chop is enabled. In this mode, the settling time equals twice the update rate. Figure 17  to Figure 20  show \nthe filter response with chop disabled.  \n \n04854-012DOUT/RD Y\nDIN\nSCLK\nCS\nDVDDSERIAL\nINTERFACE\nAND\nLOGIC\nCONTROLΣ-Δ\nADCAD7794/AD7795 AIN1(+)REFIN1(+)\nAIN1(–)\nAIN2(+)\nAIN2(–)\nAIN3(+)\nAIN3(–)\nREFIN2(+)\nIOUT1\nREFIN1(–)IN-AMPVDD\nGNDMUX\nPSW\nGNDINTERNAL\nCLOCK\nCLKGND AVDD\nVDDIN+\nIN–OUT– OUT+\nIN+\nIN–OUT– OUT+\nRCMVDD\nREFIN2(–)BUF\n \nFigure 12.

Data is written to these registers \nvia the serial interface. Read access to the on-chip registers is \nalso provided by this interface. All communications with the parts must start with a write to the communications register. After power-on or reset, each device expects a write to its communications register. The data written to this register \ndetermines whether the next operation is a read operation or a \nwrite operation, and determines to which register this read or write operation occurs. Therefore, write access to any of the other registers on the parts begins with a write operation to the communications register, followed by a write to the selected register. A read operation from any other register (except when \ncontinuous read mode is selected) starts with a write to the \ncommunications register, followed by a read operation from the \nselected register.  \nThe serial interface of the AD7794/AD7795 consists of four \nsignals: CS, DIN, SCLK, and DOUT/ RDY . The DIN line is used to transfer data into the on-chip registers, while DOUT/ RDY  is \nused for accessing data from the on-chip registers. SCLK is the \nserial clock input for the devices, and all data transfers (either \non DIN or DOUT/ RDY ) occur with respect to the SCLK signal. \nThe DOUT/ RDY  pin also operates as a data ready signal; the \nline goes low when a new data-word is available in the output \nregister. It is reset high when a read operation from the data register is complete. It also goes high prior to the updating of the data register to indicate when not to read from the device, to \nensure that a data read is not attempted while the register is \nbeing updated. \nCS is used to select a device. It can be used to \ndecode the AD7794/AD7795 in systems where several \ncomponents are connected to the serial bus.  \nFigure 3  and Figure 4  show timing diagrams for interfacing to the \nAD7794/AD7795 with CS, which is being used to decode the parts. \nFigure 3  shows the timing for a read operation from the output \nshift register of the AD7794/AD7795, while Figure 4  shows the \ntiming for a write operation to the input shift register. It is \npossible to read the same word from the data register several \ntimes, even though the DOUT/ RDY  line returns high after the \nfirst read operation. However, care must be taken to ensure that \nthe read operations have been completed before the next output \nupdate occurs. In continuous read mode, the data register can \nbe read only once.  \nThe serial interface can operate in 3-wire mode by tying CS low. \nIn this case, the SCLK, DIN, and DOUT/ RDY  lines are used to \ncommunicate with the AD7794/AD7795. The end of the \nconversion can be monitored using the RDY  bit in the status \nregister. This scheme is suitable for interfacing to micro-controllers. If \nCS is required as a decoding signal, it can be \ngenerated from a port pin. For microcontroller interfaces, it is \nrecommended that SCLK idle high between data transfers.  \nThe AD7794/AD7795 can be operated with CS being used as a \nframe synchronization signal. This scheme is useful for DSP \ninterfaces. In this case, the first bit (MSB) is effectively clocked \nout by CS, because CS normally occurs after the falling edge of \nSCLK in DSPs. The SCLK can continue to run between data \ntransfers, provided the timing numbers are obeyed.  \nThe serial interface can be reset by writing a series of 1s on the \nDIN input. If a Logic 1 is written to the AD7794/AD7795 line for at least 32 serial clock cycles, the serial interface is reset. This ensures that the interface can be reset to a known state if the interface gets lost due to a software error or some glitch in \nthe system. Reset returns the interface to the state in which it is \nexpecting a write to the communications register. This operation resets the contents of all registers to their power-on values. Following a reset, the user should allow a period of \n500 μs before addressing the serial interface.  \nThe AD7794/AD7795 can be config ured to continuously convert \nor perform a single conversion (see Figure 21  through Figure 23 ).\n  AD7794/AD7795\n \nRev.

D | Page 30 of 36 Single Conversion Mode  \nIn single conversion mode, the AD7794/AD7795 are placed in \nshutdown mode between conversions. When a single \nconversion is initiated by setting MD2 to 0, MD1 to 0, and MD0 \nto 1 in the mode register, the AD7794/AD7795 power up, perform a single conversion, and then return to shutdown mode. The on-chip oscillator requires 1 ms to power up. A \nconversion requires a time period of 2 × t\nADC. DOUT/ RDY  goes \nlow to indicate the completion of a conversion. When the data-word has been read from the data register, DOUT/\nRDY  goes \nhigh. If CS is low, DOUT/ RDY  remains high until another \nconversion is initiated and completed. The data register can be read several times, if required, even when DOUT/\nRDY  has \ngone high.  \nContinuous Conversion Mode  \nThis is the default power-up mode. The AD7794/AD7795 \ncontinuously convert with the RDY  pin in the status register \ngoing low each time a conversion is complete. If CS is low, the \nDOUT/ RDY  line also goes low when a conversion is complete. \nTo read a conversion, the user writes to the communications \nregister, indicating that the next operation is a read of the data \nregister. The digital conversion is placed on the DOUT/ RDY  \npin as soon as SCLK pulses are applied to the ADC. DOUT/ RDY  \nreturns high when the conversion is read. The user can read this \nregister additional times, if required. However, the user must \nensure that the data register is not being accessed at the completion \nof the next conversion, or else the new conversion word is lost. Continuous Read  \nRather than write to the communications register each time a \nconversion is complete to access the data, the AD7794/AD7795 \ncan be configured so that the conversions are placed on the \nDOUT/ RDY  line automatically. By writing 01011100 to the \ncommunications register, the user need only apply the \nappropriate number of SCLK cycles to the ADC. The 24-bit \nword is automatically placed on the DOUT/ RDY  line when a \nconversion is complete. The ADC should be configured for \ncontinuous conversion mode.  \nWhen DOUT/ RDY  goes low to indicate the end of a conversion, \nsufficient SCLK cycles must be applied to the ADC, and the \ndata conversion is placed on the DOUT/ RDY  line. When the \nconversion is read, DOUT/ RDY  returns high until the next \nconversion is available.  \nIn this mode, the data can be read only once. Also, the user must \nensure that the data-word is read before the next conversion is complete. If the user has not read the conversion before the completion of the next conversion, or if insufficient serial clocks are applied to the AD7794/AD7795 to read the word, the serial \noutput register is reset when the next conversion is complete. \nThe new conversion is then placed in the output serial register.  \nTo exit the continuous read mode, the instruction 01011000 \nmust be written to the communications register while the RDY  \npin is low. While in the continuous read mode, the ADC \nmonitors activity on the DIN line so that it can receive the instruction to exit the continuous read mode. Additionally, a reset occurs if 32 consecutive 1s are seen on DIN. Therefore, DIN should be held low in continuous read mode until an instruction is to be written to the device.  \n  AD7794/AD7795\n \nRev. D | Page 31 of 36 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION  \nANALOG INPUT CHANNEL  \nThe AD7794/AD7795 have six differential analog input \nchannels. These are connected to the on-chip buffer amplifier \nwhen the devices are operated in buffered mode. When in unbuffered mode, the channels connect directly to the \nmodulator. In buffered mode (the BUF bit in the configuration \nregister is set to 1), the input channel feeds into a high impedance input stage of the buffer amplifier. Therefore, the input can tolerate significant source impedances and is tailored for direct connection to external resistive-type sensors such as \nstrain gages or resistance temperature detectors (RTDs).  \nWhen BUF = 0, the parts operate in unbuffered mode. This \nresults in a higher analog input current. Note that this \nunbuffered input path provides a dynamic load to the driving \nsource. Therefore, resistor/capacitor combinations on the input pins can cause gain errors, depending on the output impedance of the source that is driving the ADC input. Table 22  shows the \nallowable external resistance/capacitance values for unbuffered mode so that no gain error at the 20-bit level is introduced.  \nTable 22. External R-C Combination for 20-Bit No Gain Error \nCapacitance (pF)  Resistance (Ω)  \n50  9 k  \n100  6 k  \n500  1.5 k  \n1000  900  \n5000  200  \nThe AD7794/AD7795 can be operated in unbuffered mode  only when the gain equals 1 or 2. At higher gains, the buffer  \nis automatically enabled. The absolute input voltage range in \nbuffered mode is restricted to a range between GND + 100 mV and AV\nDD − 100 mV . When the gain is set to 4 or higher, the  \nin-amp is enabled. The absolute input voltage range when the in-amp is active is restricted to a range between GND + 300 mV and \nAV\nDD − 1.1 V . Care must be taken in setting up the common-\nmode voltage so that these limits are not exceeded. Otherwise, \nthere is degradation in linearity and noise performance.  \nThe absolute input voltage in unbuffered mode includes the \nrange between GND − 30 mV and AV DD + 30 mV as a result of \nbeing unbuffered. The negative absolute input voltage limit does allow the possibility of monitoring small, true bipolar signals with respect to GND.  \n INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER \nAmplifying the analog input signal by a gain of 1 or 2 is \nperformed digitally within the AD7794/AD7795. However, \nwhen the gain equals 4 or higher, the output from the buffer is applied to the input of the on-chip instrumentation amplifier. \nThis low noise in-amp means that signals of small amplitude \ncan be gained within the AD7794/AD7795 while still maintaining excellent noise performance. For example, when the gain is set to 64, the rms noise is 40 nV typically, which is equivalent to 21 bits effective resolution or 18.5 bits peak-to-\npeak resolution.  \nEach AD7794/AD7795 can be programmed to have a gain of 1, \n2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 using Bit G2 to Bit G0 in the \nconfiguration register. Therefore, with an external 2.5 V \nreference, the unipolar ranges are from 0 mV to 20 mV to 0 V to 2.5 V and the bipolar ranges are from ±20 mV to ±2.5 V . When the in-amp is active (gain ≥ 4), the common-mode voltage ((AIN(+) + AIN(−))/2) must be greater than or equal to \n0.5 V when chop is enabled. With chop disabled, and with the \nAMP-CM bit set to 1 to prevent degradation in the common-mode rejection, the allowable common-mode voltage is limited \nto between \n0.2 + (Gain/2 × ( AIN(+)  − AIN(−) )) \nand  \nAV DD − 0.2 − (Gain /2 × (AIN(+)  − AIN(−) )) \nIf the AD7794/AD7795 are operated with an external reference \nthat has a value equal to AV DD, for correct operation, the analog \ninput signal must be limited to 90% of V REF/gain when the in-\namp is active.  \nBIPOLAR/UNIPOLAR CONFIGURATION  \nThe analog input to the AD7794/AD7795 can accept either \nunipolar or bipolar input voltage ranges. A bipolar input range \ndoes not imply that the parts can tolerate negative voltages with respect to system GND. Unipolar and bipolar signals on the AIN(+) input are referenced to the voltage on the AIN(−) input. \nFor example, if AIN(−) is 2.5 V and the ADC is configured for \nunipolar mode with a gain of 1, the input voltage range on the \nAIN(+) pin is 2.5 V to 5 V .  \nIf the ADC is configured for bipolar mode, the analog input \nrange on the AIN(+) input is 0 V to 5 V . The bipolar/unipolar \noption is chosen by programming the U/ B bit in the \nconfiguration register.  \nAD7794/AD7795 \n \nRev. D | Page 32 of 36 DATA OUTPUT CODING  \nWhen the ADC is configured for unipolar operation, the output \ncode is natural (straight) binary with a zero differential input \nvoltage resulting in a code of 00...00, a miscalled voltage resulting in a code of 100...000, and a full-scale input voltage \nresulting in a code of 111...111. The output code for any analog \ninput voltage can be represented as  \nCode  = (2N × AIN × GAIN )/VREF\nWhen the ADC is configured for bipolar operation, the output \ncode is offset binary with a negative full-scale voltage resulting in a code of 000...000, a zero differential input voltage resulting in a code of 100...000, and a positive full-scale input voltage resulting in a code of 111...111. The output code for any analog input voltage can be represented as  \nCode  = 2N – 1 × [( AIN × GAIN /VREF) + 1] \nwhere:  \nAIN is the analog input voltage. \nGAIN  is the in-amp setting (1 to 128). \nN = 24. \nBURNOUT CURRENTS \nThe AD7794/AD7795 contain two 100 nA constant current \ngenerators, one sourcing current from AV DD to AIN(+), and one \nsinking current from AIN(−) to GND. The currents are \nswitched to the selected analog input pair. Both currents are either on or off, depending on the burnout current enable (BO) \nbit in the configuration register. These currents can be used to \nverify that an external transducer is still operational before attempting to take measurements on that channel. Once the burnout currents are turned on, they flow in the external transducer circuit, and a measurement of the input voltage on \nthe analog input channel can be taken. If the resulting voltage \nmeasured is full scale, the user needs to verify why this is the \ncase. A full-scale reading could mean that the front-end sensor is open circuit. It could also mean that the front-end sensor is overloaded and is justified in outputting full scale, or that the \nreference may be absent and the NOXREF bit is set, thus \nclamping the data to all 1s. \nWhen reading all 1s from the output, the user needs to check \nthese three cases before making a judgment. If the voltage measured is 0 V , it may indicate that the transducer has short circuited. For normal operation, these burnout currents are turned off by writing a 0 to the BO bit in the configuration \nregister. The current sources work over the normal absolute \ninput voltage range specifications with buffers on. EXCITATION CURRENTS \nThe AD7794/AD7795 also contain two matched, software \nconfigurable, constant current sources that can be programmed \nto equal 10 μA, 210 μA, or 1 mA. Both source currents from AV\nDD are directed to either the IOUT1 or IOUT2 pin of the \ndevice. These current sources are controlled via bits in the IO register. The configuration bits enable the current sources and direct the current sources to IOUT1 or IOUT2, along with selecting the value of the current. These current sources can be \nused to excite external resistive bridge or RTD sensors. \nBIAS VOLTAGE GENERATOR \nA bias voltage generator is included on the AD7794/AD7795. It \nbiases the negative terminal of the selected input channel to \nAV DD/2. This function is available on inputs AIN1(−) to \nAIN3(−). It is useful in thermocouple applications, as the voltage generated by the thermocouple must be biased about some dc voltage if the gain is greater than 2. This is necessary because the instrumentation amplifier requires headroom. If there is no headroom, signals close to GND or AV\nDD do not \nconvert accurately.  \nThe bias voltage generator is controlled using the VBIAS1 and \nVBIAS0 bits in conjunction with the BOOST bit in the \nconfiguration register. The power-up time of the bias voltage generator is dependent on the load capacitance. To accommodate higher load capacitances, each AD7794/AD7795 has a BOOST bit. When this bit is set to 1, the current consumed by the bias \nvoltage generator is increased so that power-up time is reduced \nconsiderably. Figure 11  shows the power-up times when \nBOOST equals 0 and BOOST equals 1 for different load capacitances. The current consumption of the AD7794/AD7795 increases by 40 μA when the bias voltage generator is enabled, \nand BOOST equals 0. With the BOOST function enabled, the \ncurrent consumption increases by 250 μA.  \nREFERENCE \nThe AD7794/AD7795 have embedded 1.17 V references. These \nreferences can be used to supply the ADC or external references \ncan be applied. The embedded references are low noise, low drift references with 4 ppm/°C drift typically. For external references, the ADC has a fully differential input capability for the channel. In addition, the user has the option of selecting one \nof two external reference options (REFIN1 or REFIN2). The \nreference source for the AD7794/AD7795 is selected using the REFSEL1 and REFSEL0 bits in the configuration register. When the internal reference is selected, it is internally connected to \nthe modulator (it is not available on the REFIN pins). \nThe common-mode range for these differential inputs is from \nGND to AV DD. The reference input is unbuffered; therefore, \nexcessive R-C source impedances introduce gain errors. The reference voltage REFIN (REFIN(+) − REFIN(−)) is 2.5 V nominal, but the AD7794/AD7795 are functional with reference voltages from 0.1 V to AV\nDD. In applications where the \nexcitation (voltage or current) for the transducer on the analog \n  AD7794/AD7795\n \nRev. D | Page 33 of 36 input also drives the reference voltage for the parts, the effect of \nthe low frequency noise in the excitation source is removed, because the application is ratiometric. If the AD7794/AD7795 are used in nonratiometric applications, a low noise reference should be used.  \nRecommended 2.5 V reference voltage sources for the \nAD7794/AD7795 include the ADR381  and ADR391 , which are \nlow noise, low power references. Also, note that the reference \ninputs provide a high impedance, dynamic load. Because the input impedance of each reference input is dynamic, resis-tor/capacitor combinations on these inputs can cause dc gain \nerrors, depending on the output impedance of the source \ndriving the reference inputs. \nReference voltage sources (for example, the  ADR391 ) typically \nhave low output impedances and are, therefore, tolerant to \nhaving decoupling capacitors on REFIN(+) without introducing gain errors in the system. Deriving the reference input voltage across an external resistor means that the reference input sees a \nsignificant external source impedance. External decoupling on \nthe REFIN pins is not recommended in this type of circuit \nconfiguration. \nREFERENCE DETECT \nThe AD7794/AD7795 include on-chip circuitry to detect if they \nhave a valid reference for conversions or calibrations when the \nuser selects an external reference as the reference source. This feature is enabled when the REF_DET bit in the configuration register is set to 1. If the voltage between the selected REFIN(+) \nand REFIN(–) pins goes below 0.3 V , or either the REFIN(+) or \nREFIN(–) inputs are open circuit, the AD7794/AD7795 detect that they no longer have valid references. In this case, the NOXREF bit of the status register is set to 1. If the AD7794/ AD7795 are performing normal conversions and the NOXREF \nbit becomes active, the conversion results revert to all 1s. \nTherefore, it is not necessary to continuously monitor the status of the NOXREF bit when performing conversions. It is only necessary to verify its status if the conversion result read from the ADC data register is all 1s. If the AD7794/AD7795 are \nperforming either offset or full-scale calibrations and the \nNOXREF bit becomes active, the updating of the respective calibration registers is inhibited to avoid loading incorrect coefficients to these registers, and the ERR bit in the status register is set. If the user is concerned about verifying that a \nvalid reference is in place every time a calibration is performed, \nthe status of the ERR bit should be checked at the end of the \ncalibration cycle.  \nRESET \nThe circuitry and serial interface of the AD7794/AD7795 can \nbe reset by writing 32 consecutive 1s to the device. This resets \nthe logic, the digital filter, and the analog modulator, and all on-chip registers are reset to their default values. A reset is automatically performed on power-up. When a reset is initiated, \nthe user must allow a period of 500 μs before accessing any of the on-chip registers. A reset is useful if the serial interface \nbecomes asynchronous due to noise on the SCLK line. \nAV DD MONITOR \nAlong with converting external voltages, the ADC can be  \nused to monitor the voltage on the AV DD pin. When Bit CH2  \nto Bit CH0 equals 1, the voltage on the AV DD pin is internally \nattenuated by 6, and the resulting voltage is applied to the  ∑-Δ modulator using an internal 1.17 V reference for analog- \nto-digital conversion. This is useful because variations in the \npower supply voltage can be monitored. \nCALIBRATION \nThe AD7794/AD7795 provide four calibration modes that can \nbe programmed via the mode bits in the mode register. These \nare internal zero-scale calibration, internal full-scale calibration, system zero-scale calibration, and system full-scale calibration, which effectively reduce the offset error and full-scale error to \nthe order of the noise. After each conversion, the ADC \nconversion result is scaled using the ADC calibration registers before being written to the data register. The offset calibration coefficient is subtracted from the result prior to multiplication \nby the full-scale coefficient. \nTo start a calibration, write the relevant value to the MD2 to \nMD0 bits in the mode register. After the calibration is \ncompleted, the contents of the corresponding calibration \nregisters are updated, the RDY  bit in the status register is set, \nthe DOUT/ RDY  pin goes low (if CS is low), and the \nAD7794/AD7795 revert to idle mode. \nDuring an internal zero-scale or full-scale calibration, the \nrespective zero input and full-scale input are automatically \nconnected internally to the ADC input pins. A system calibration, however, expects the system zero-scale and system full-scale voltages to be applied to the ADC pins before initiating the \ncalibration mode. In this way, external ADC errors are removed. \nFrom an operational point of view, a calibration should be \ntreated like another ADC conversion. A zero-scale calibration, \nif required, should always be performed before a full-scale \ncalibration. System software should monitor the RDY  bit in the \nstatus register or the DOUT/ RDY  pin to determine the end of \ncalibration via a polling sequence or an interrupt-driven routine. \nWith chop enabled, both an internal offset calibration and  \na system offset calibration take two conversion cycles. With \nchop enabled, an internal offset calibration is not needed because the ADC itself removes the offset continuously. With chop disabled, an internal offset calibration or system offset calibration takes one conversion cycle to complete. Internal offset calibrations are required with chop disabled and should occur before the full-scale calibration. \nTo perform an internal full-scale calibration, a full-scale input voltage is automatically connected to the selected analog input for this calibration. When the gain equals 1, a calibration takes two conversion cycles to complete when chop is enabled and \nAD7794/AD7795 \n \nRev. D | Page 34 of 36 one conversion cycle when chop is disabled. For higher gains, \nfour conversion cycles are required to perform the full-scale calibration when chop is enabled, and two conversion cycles \nwhen chop is disabled. DOUT/\nRDY  goes high when the \ncalibration is initiated and returns low when the calibration is \ncomplete. The ADC is placed in idle mode following a cali-\nbration. The measured full-scale coefficient is placed in the full-\nscale register of the selected channel. Internal full-scale calibrations cannot be performed when the gain equals 128. With this gain setting, a system full-scale calibration can be performed. A full-scale calibration is required each time the gain of a channel is changed to minimize the full-scale error. \nAn internal full-scale calibration can be performed at specified \nupdate rates only. For gains of 1, 2, and 4, an internal full-scale \ncalibration can be performed at any update rate. However, for higher gains, internal full-scale calibrations can be performed only when the update rate is less than or equal to 16.7 Hz, 33.3 Hz, and 50 Hz. However, the full-scale error does not vary with \nupdate rate, so a calibration at one update is valid for all update \nrates (assuming the gain or reference source is not changed). \nA system full-scale calibration takes two conversion cycles to \ncomplete, irrespective of the gain setting when chop is enabled and one conversion cycle when chop is disabled. A system full-scale calibration can be performed at all gains and all update rates. With chop disabled, the offset calibration (internal or \nsystem offset) should be performed before the system full-scale \ncalibration is initiated. \nGROUNDING AND LAYOUT \nBecause the analog inputs and reference inputs of the ADC are \ndifferential, most of the voltages in the analog modulator are \ncommon-mode voltages. The excellent common-mode rejection of the part removes common-mode noise on these inputs. The digital filter provides rejection of broadband noise on the power supply, except at integer multiples of the \nmodulator sampling frequency. The digital filter also removes \nnoise from the analog and reference inputs, provided that these noise sources do not saturate the analog modulator. As a result, the AD7794/AD7795 are more immune to noise interference \nthan conventional high resolution converters. However, because \nthe resolution of the AD7794/AD7795 is so high, and the noise levels from the AD7794/AD7795 are so low, care must be taken \nwith regard to grounding and layout. \nThe printed circuit board that houses the AD7794/AD7795 \nshould be designed so that the analog and digital sections are separated and confined to certain areas of the board. A minimum etch technique is generally best for ground planes because it gives the best shielding. \nIt is recommended that th e GND pin of the AD7794/AD7795 \nbe tied to the AGND plane of the system. In any layout, it is important that the user keep in mind the flow of currents in the system, ensuring that the return paths for all currents are as close as possible to the paths the currents took to reach their destinations. Avoid forcing digital currents to flow through the AGND sections of the layout. \nThe ground plane of the AD7794/AD7795 should be allowed to \nrun under the AD7794/AD7795 to prevent noise coupling. The \npower supply lines to the AD7794/AD7795 should use as wide a trace as possible to provide low impedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals, such as clocks, should be shielded with digital ground \nto avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board. In \naddition, clock signals should never be run near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board should run at right angles to each \nother. This reduces the effects of feedthrough through the \nboard. A microstrip technique is the best, but it is not always \npossible with a double-sided board. In this technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to ground planes, \nwhile signals are placed on the solder side. \nGood decoupling is important when using high resolution \nADCs. AV DD should be decoupled with 10 μF tantalum in \nparallel with 0.1 μF capacitors to GND. DV DD should be \ndecoupled with 10 μF tantalum in parallel with 0.1 μF capacitors to the system’s DGND plane, with the system’s AGND to DGND connection being close to the AD7794/AD7795. To achieve the best from these decoupling components, they should be placed as close as possible to the device, ideally right up against the device. All logic chips should be decoupled with 0.1 μF ceramic capacitors to DGND. \n AD7794/AD7795\n \nRev. D | Page 35 of 36 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe AD7794/AD7795 offer low cost, high resolution analog-to-\ndigital functions. Because the analog-to-digital function is provided by a ∑-Δ architecture, it makes the parts more immune to noisy environments, making them ideal for use in sensor measurement, and industrial and process control applications.  \nFLOWMETER \nFigure 24  shows the AD7794/AD7795 being used in a \nflowmeter application that consists of two pressure transducers, with the rate of flow being equal to the pressure difference. The pressure transducers shown are the BP01 from Sensym. The pressure transducers are arranged in a bridge network and give a differential output voltage between its OUT+ and OUT– terminals. With rated full-scale pressure (in this case \n300 mmHg) on the transducer, the differential output voltage is \n3 mV/V of the input voltage (that is, the voltage between the \nIN(+) and IN(–) terminals). \nAssuming a 5 V excitation voltage, the full-scale output range \nfrom the transducer is 15 mV . The excitation voltage for the bridge can be used to directly provide the reference for the \nADC, as the reference input range includes the supply voltage. \n A second advantage of using th e AD7794/AD7795 in transducer-\nbased applications is that the low-side power switch can be fully \nutilized in low power applications. The low-side power switch is connected in series with the cold side of the bridges. In normal \noperation, the switch is closed and measurements can be taken. \nIn applications where power is of concern, the AD7794/AD7795 can be placed in standby mode, thus significantly reducing the power consumed in the application. In addition, the low-side power switch can be opened while in standby mode, thus \navoiding unnecessary power consumption by the front-end \ntransducers. When the parts are taken out of standby mode, and \nthe low-side power switch is closed, the user should ensure that the front-end circuitry is fully settled before attempting a read \nfrom the AD7794/AD7795. \nIn the diagram, temperature compensation is performed using a \nthermistor. The on-chip excitation current supplies the thermistor. In addition, the reference voltage for the temperature measurement \nis derived from a precision resistor in series with the thermistor. \nThis allows a ratiometric measurement so that variation of the excitation current has no effect on the measurement (it is the ratio of the precision reference resistance to the thermistor \nresistance that is measured). \n \n04854-025DOUT/RD Y\nDIN\nSCLK\nCS\nDVDDSERIAL\nINTERFACE\nAND\nLOGIC\nCONTROLΣ-Δ\nADCAD7794/AD7795 AIN1(+)REFIN1(+)\nAIN1(–)\nAIN2(+)\nAIN2(–)\nAIN3(+)\nAIN3(–)\nREFIN2(+)\nIOUT1\nREFIN1(–)IN-AMPVDD\nGNDMUX\nPSW\nGNDINTERNAL\nCLOCK\nCLKGND AVDD\nVDDIN+\nIN–OUT– OUT+\nIN+\nIN–OUT– OUT+\nRCMVDD\nREFIN2(–)BUF\nFigure 24.
