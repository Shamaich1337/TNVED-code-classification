System Overview\nThe CP2103 is a highly-integrated USB-to-UART Bridge Controller providing a simp le solution for updating\nRS-232/RS-485 designs to USB using a minimum of components and PCB space. The CP2103 includes a USB\n2.0 full-speed function contro ller, USB transceiver, oscillator, EEPROM, and asynchronous serial data bus (UART)\nwith full modem control signals in a compact 5x5 mm QFN-28 package (sometimes called “MLF” or “MLP”). Noother external USB components are required.\nThe on-chip EEPROM may be us ed to customize the USB Vendor ID, Product ID, Product Description String,\nPower Descriptor, Device Release Number, and Device Serial Number as desired for OEM applications. The\nEEPROM is programmed on -board via the USB, allowing the programming step to be ea sily integrat ed into the\nproduct manufacturing and testing process.Royalty-free Virtual COM Port (VCP ) device drivers provided by Silicon Laboratories a llow a CP2103-based\nproduct to appear as a COM port to PC applications. The CP2103 UART interface implements all RS-232/RS-485\nsignals, including control and handshaking signals; so, exis ting system firmware does not need to be modified. The\ndevice also features up to four GPIO signals that can be user-defined for status and control information. Support\nfor I/O interface voltages down to 1.8 V is provided via a V\nIO pin. In many existing RS-232 designs, all that is\nrequired to update the design from RS-232 to USB is to replace the RS-232 level-translator with the CP2103.Direct access driver support is av ailable through the Silic on Laboratories USBXpre ss driver set. Go to\nwww.silabs.com  for the latest application notes and product support information for CP2103.\nAn evaluation kit for the CP2103 (Part Number: CP2103EK) is available. It includes a CP2103-based USB-to-UART/RS-232 evaluation board, a complete set of VCP device drivers, USB and RS-232 cables, and complete\ndocumentation.

USB Function Controller and Transceiver\nThe universal serial bus func tion controller in the CP2103 is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with integrated\ntransceiver and on-chip matching and pull-up resistors. The USB function controller manages all data transfers\nbetween the USB and the UART as well as command requests generated by the USB host controller and\ncommands for controlling the function of the UART. \nThe USB Suspend and Resume signals are supported for power management of both the CP2103 device as well\nas external circuitry. The CP2103 w ill enter Suspend mode when  Suspend signaling is de tected on the bus. Upon\nentering Suspend mode, the CP2103 asserts th e SUSPEND and SUSPEND  signals. SUSPEND and SUSPEND\nare also asserted after a CP2103 reset until device configuration during USB Enumeration is complete.\nThe CP2103 exits the Suspend mode when any of the foll owing events occurs: (1) Resume signaling is detected or\ngenerated, (2) a USB Reset signal is detected, or (3) a device reset occurs. Upon exit from Suspend mode, the\nSUSPEND and SUSPEND  signals are de-asserted.\nBoth SUSPEND and SUSPEND  temporarily float high during a CP2103 reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a\nstrong pulldown (10 k \uf057) can be used to ensure SUSPEND  remains low during reset. See Figure 6 for other\nrecommended options.\nFigure 6. Typical Connection DiagramOption 1: A 4.7 k \uf057 pull-up resistor can be added to increase noise immunity.\nOption 2: A 4.7 µF capacitor can be added if powering other devices from the on-chip regulator.\nOption 3: Avalanche transient voltage suppression diodes should be added for ESD protection. \nOption 3: Use Littlefuse p/n SP0503BAHT or equivalent.\nOption 4: 10 k \uf057 resistor to ground to hold SUSPEND low on initial power on or device reset.1CP2103\nSUSPENDSUSPEND\n1112REGIN7\nGND2RST9\nD+3D-48C2\n0.1 \uf06dFC1\n1 \uf06dF\nRI\nDCD\nCTSRTSRXDTXDDSRDTR1\n28\n27\n26\n25\n24\n23\n222\n3External RS-232 \ntransceiver or \nUART circuitry(to external circuitry \nfor USB suspend states)\nVBUS\nD-\nD+\nGND4\n5\n6USB \nCONNECTOR6VDD\nVBUSVDD\nR1\n4.7 k\uf057\nD1 D2 D3Option 1\nR2\n10 k\uf057\nOption 4\nOption 3C4\n4.7 \uf06dF\nOption 2VIO5\n1 \uf06dFI/O Voltage\nGPIO.3GPIO.2GPIO.1GPIO.019\n18\n17\n16External \nApplication \nCircuitry\nCP2103\n14 Rev. 1.05.  Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interface\nThe CP2103 UART interface consists of the TX (transmit)  and RX (receive) data signals as well as the RTS, CTS,\nDSR, DTR, DCD, and RI control sign als. The UART supports RTS/CTS, DSR/DTR, and X-On/X-Off handshaking.\nThe UART can be programmed to support a variety of data formats and baud rates. If the Virtual COM Port drivers\nare used, the data format and baud rate  are set during COM port configuration on the PC. If the U SBXpress drivers\nare used, the CP2103 is configured th rough the USBXpress API. Th e available data formats and baud rates are\nlisted in Table 9.\n6.  GPIO Pins\nThe CP2103 supports four user-configurable GPIO pins fo r status and control information. More information\nregarding the configuration and use of  these pins can be found in “AN144:  CP21xx Device Customization Guide”\nand “AN223: Port Configuration and GPIO for CP210x” available at www.silabs.com.\n7.  Internal EEPROM\nThe CP2103 includes an  internal EEPROM that may be  used to customize the USB V endor ID (VID), Product ID\n(PID), Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, and Device Serial Number as\ndesired for OEM applications. If the EEPROM is not programmed with OEM data, the default configuration data\nshown in Table 10 is used.\nWhile customization of the USB configuration data is optional, it is recommended  to customize the VID/PID\ncombination. A unique VID/PI D combination prevents the driver from conflicting with any other USB driver. A\nvendor ID can be obtained from www.usb.org , or Silicon Labs can provide a free  PID for the OEM product that can\nbe used with the Silicon Laboratories VID. It is also  recommended to customize t he serial number if the OEM\napplication is one in which it is possible for multiple CP2103-based de vices to be connecte d to the same PC.\nThe internal EEPROM is prog rammed via the USB. This allows the OEM\'s USB configuration data and serial\nnumber to be written to the CP2103 on-board during the manufacturing and testing pr ocess. A stand-alone utility\nfor programming the internal EEPROM is available from Silicon Labs. A library of routines provided in the form of a\nWindows® DLL is also available. This library can be used to integrate the EEPROM programming step into custom\nsoftware used by the OEM to streamline testing and  serial number management during manufacturing. The\nEEPROM has a typical endurance of 100,000 write cycles with  a data retention of 100 ye ars. USB descriptors can\nbe locked to prevent future modification.Table 9.

CP2103 Device Drivers\nThere are two sets of device drivers available for the CP 2103 devices: the Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers and the\nUSBXpress Direct Access drivers. Only one set of dr ivers is necessary to interface with t he device. The latest\ndrivers are available at http://www.silabs.com/products/m icrocontroller/downloads.asp .\n8.1.  Virtual CO M Port Drivers\nThe CP2103 Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers a llow a CP2103-based device to appear to the PC\'s\napplication software as a COM port. Application software running on the PC accesses the CP2103-based device\nas it would access a standard hardware COM port. Howeve r, actual data transfer between the PC and the CP2103\ndevice is performed over the USB inte rface. Therefore, existi ng COM port applications ma y be used to transfer\ndata via the USB to the CP2103-based device without modifying the application. See “AN197: Serial\nCommunications Guide for the CP210x” for example co de for interfacing to a CP2103 using the Virtual COM\ndrivers.\n8.2.  USBXpress Drivers\nThe Silicon Laboratories USBXpress drivers provide an alternate solution for inte rfacing with CP2103 devices. No\nserial port protocol expertise is required. Instead, a simple , high-level application program interface (API) is used to\nprovide simpler CP201x connectivity and functionalit y. The USBXpress for CP210x Development Kit includes\nWindows device drivers, Windows device driver installe rs and uninstallers, and a host interface function library\n(host API) provided in the form of a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The USBXpress driver set isrecommended for new products that also include new PC software. The USBXpress interface is described in“AN169: USBXpress\n® Programmer\'s Guide.”\n8.3.  Driver Customization\nIn addition to customizing the device as described in “7. Internal EEPROM” , the drivers and the drivers installation\npackage can be also be customized. See “AN220: USB Driv er Customization” for more information on generating\ncustomized VCP and USBXpress drivers.\n8.4.  Driver Certification\nThe default drivers that are shipped with the CP2103 are Microsoft WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs)\ncertified. The certification means that the drivers have been tested by Microsoft, and their latest operating systems\n(XP and Vista) allow the drivers to be installed without any warnings or errors.\nThe customized drivers generated using the AN220 software are not automatically certified. They must go first\nthrough the Microsoft Driver Reseller Submission process. Contact Silicon Lab oratories support fo r assistance with\nthis process.Table 10.

Voltage Regulator\nThe CP2103 includes an on-chip 5 to 3 V voltage regulator.  This allows the CP2103 to be configured as either a\nUSB bus-powered device or a USB self-powered device. These configurations are shown in Figures 7 and 8.\nWhen enabled, the 3 V voltage regulator output appears on the VDD pin and can be used to power external 3 V\ndevices. See Table 11 for the voltage regulator electrical characteristics.\nAlternatively, if 3 V power is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2103 can function as  a USB self-powered device with\nthe voltage regulator disabled. For this configuration, it is recommended that the REGIN input be tied to the 3 V net\nto disable the voltage regulator. This configuration is shown in Figure 9.\nThe USB max power and power attributes descriptor must  match the device power usage and configuration. See\n“AN144: CP21xx Device Customizatio n Guide” for information on how to  customize USB descriptors for the\nCP2103.\nNote: It is recommended that additi onal decoupling capacitance (e.g., 0.1 µF in pa rallel with 1.0 µF) be provided on the REGIN\ninput.\nFigure 7.
