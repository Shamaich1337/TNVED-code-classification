The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns\n® product in a user application may vary \nfrom the data sheet characteristics and parameters due to (i) the combination of the Bourns® product with other components \nin the user’s application, or (ii) the environment of the user application itself.  The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® \nproduct also can and do vary in different applications and actual performance may vary over time.

If Bourns expressly identifies a sub-category of automotive application in the data sheet for its standard products (such as infotainment \nor lighting), such identification means that Bourns has reviewed its standard product and has determined that if such Bourns\n® \nstandard product is considered for potential use in automotive applications, it should only be used in such sub-category of \nautomotive applications.  Any reference to Bourns® standard product in the data sheet as compliant with the AEC-Q standard \nor “automotive grade” does not by itself mean that Bourns has approved such product for use in an automotive application.\nBourns® standard products are not tested to comply with United States Federal Aviation Administration standards generally \nor any other generally equivalent governmental organization standard applicable to products designed or manufactured for \nuse in aircraft or space applications.

#### Description:
The MF-RX300 is a **Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) Resettable Fuse** designed for overcurrent protection in low voltage applications. It is a radial leaded device that resets itself after the fault condition is removed, making it suitable for protecting circuits from overloads and short circuits without the need for replacement.

#### Typical Applications:
The MF-RX300 is commonly used in various applications where low voltage power supplies (up to 60V) need protection, including:
- **Security and Fire Alarm Systems**: To safeguard sensitive electronics from overcurrent conditions.
- **Loudspeakers**: Protecting audio equipment from damage due to excessive current.
- **Power Transformers**: Ensuring safe operation by preventing overloads.
- **Consumer Electronics**: Used in devices that require reliable circuit protection.

This component is particularly useful in environments where reliability and resettable protection are critical, such as in consumer electronics and industrial applications.
