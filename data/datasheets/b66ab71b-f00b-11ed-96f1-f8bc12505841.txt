It operates at a quasi -fixed frequency of \n2.5MHz and uses adaptive off -time PWM control for the \nmoderate to heavy load range. This allows using a \nsmall inductor and small capacitors for compact \ndesigns.  At light load  condition, the SGM61030A  operates  \nin power -save mode to reduce the switching frequency \nand losses for longer battery life. The power -save \nmode quiescent current is 42μA  (TYP)  while the \nshutdown current is only 0.05 μA (TYP).  For the \nSGM61030B, it operates in continuous current mode \nfrom no load to heavy load s. \nUnder -Voltage Lockout  (UVLO)  \nOperating with insufficient supply voltage can cause \ndevice malfunction or failure. The UVLO protection \nshuts down the device if the input voltage is below the \nVUVLO threshold. The UVLO comparator has a 21 0mV \nhysteresis band.  \nDevice Enable and Disable  \nWhen  the input voltage is valid, pulling the EN input to \nlogic high will enable the device and pulling it  to logic  \nlow will shut it down. In shutdown mode , the switches \nand all control circuits are turned off to reduce the \ndevice current to 0.05μA (TYP). A 550kΩ pull- down \nresistor is internally placed between EN and GND pins \nwhen the device is disabled.  \nDuring shutdown, an internal  42Ω resistor is connected \nbetween SW and GND pins and softly discharges the \noutput capacitors. This discharge function is also activated when the shutdown is caused by a thermal shutdown, UVLO, or short -circuit protection.  \n \nPower Good Output (PG)  \nThe PG pin is an open- drain output with 1mA sinking \ncapabil ity. This pin should be pulled up with an external \nresistor to a logic high rail no more than 5.5V unless it \nis not used. The PG signal is in high- impedance state \nwhen the output voltage is in regulation range. PG \nremains low until V OUT exceeds 95% of its nominal (set) \nvalue and goes low if V OUT drops below 90% of its \nnominal value.  Table 1 shows  how the PG state is \nchanged in different conditions. V PG is the threshold of the PG hysteretic comparator. It has a 5% hysteresis \nband and goes high when V FB rises above 95% of the \nVREF. \nThe PG output is useful for power supply sequencing as well. Usually, the multiple power rails of a system \nneed to be powered in a specific sequence for proper \nstartup. The PG output of the leading power supply is connected to the EN input of the subsequent power \nsupply to implement such sequencing.  \nTable 1. PG Output State in Different Conditions  \nReason  Condition(s)  PG State  \nHigh Z  Low \nOutput Voltage  EN = High, V FB ≥ V PG √  \nEN = High, V FB ≤ V PG  √ \nShutdown by EN  EN = Low   √ \nThermal Shutdown  TJ > T JSD  √ \nUVLO  0.5V < V IN < V UVLO  √ \nPower Supply Removal  VIN ≤ 0.5V  √  \n \nSoft- Start and Pre -biased Output  \nAn 800μs inter nal soft -start circuit is designed to \nprevent input inrush current and voltage drops during startup. This circuit slowly ramps up the error amplifier \nreference voltage (V\nREF = 0.6V) after exiting the \nshutdown state or under -voltage loc kout (UVLO). Slow \nincrease of the output voltage prevents the excessive inrush current for charging the output capacitors and \ncreates a smooth output voltage rise. The other \nadvantage of a soft -start is avoiding supply voltage \ndrops especially on the high internal impedance \nsources such as the primary cells and rechargeable batteries.  \nThe SGM61030 is also capable of starting with a \npre-biased output capacitor when it is powering up or \nenabled. When the device is turning on, a bias on the \noutput may exist due to the other sources connected to \nthe load(s) such as multi -voltage ICs or simply because \nof residual charges on the output capacitors. For \nexample, when a device with light load is disabled and \nre-enabled, the output may not drop during the off \nperiod and the device must restart under pre- biased \noutput condition. Without the pre- biased capability, the \ndevice may not be able to start  up properly. The output \nramp is automatically initiated with the bias voltage and \nramps up to the nominal output value.  \n  \n3A High Efficiency  \nSGM 61030  Synchronous  Buck  Converte r \n \n \n 13 \nSEPTEMBER 2022 \n SG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  \nPower -Save Mode  \nAt light load conditions , the SGM61030 A shifts to the \npower -save mode to reduce the switching frequency \nand minimize the losses. It also shuts down most of the \ninternal circuits in power -save mode. In this mode, one \nor more PWM pulses are sent to charge the output \ncapacitor and then the switches are kept off. The output \ncapacitor voltage gradually drops due to small load \ncurrent and when it falls below the nominal voltage threshold, the PWM pulses resume. If the load is still \nlow, the output will go slightly higher than normal again \nand the switches will be turned off. In pow er-save mode, \nthe output voltage is slightly higher than nominal output \nvoltage. This effect can be mitigated by a larger output \ncapacitor.  \nLow Dropout Operation (100% Duty Cycle)  \nWhen the input voltage reduces, the on- time increases. \nWhen the input voltag e is lower than the regulation \noutput voltage, the output voltage drops, and the \nSGM61030 goes into 100% duty cycle mode. The \nhigh-side switch is always turned on, and the output \nvoltage is determined by the load current times the \nRDSON composed by the hig h-side switch and inductor.  Current Limit and Hiccup Mode \nShort -Circuit  Protection  \nLimiting  the switch current  protects the switch itself and \nalso prevents over -current in the source and the \ninductor. If the high- side (HS) switch current exceeds \nthe I LIM threshold, HS switch is turned  off and the \nlow-side (LS) switch will be turned  on to reduce the \ninductor current and limit the peak.  \nIf 2ms consecutive repetition of this event occurs, the \ncontroller will stop switching and turns the output discharge circ uit on. Then a new startup will be \nautomatically initiated ( hiccup)  after 2.5ms (TYP) . The \nhiccup repeats until the overload or short -circuit fault is \ncleared.  \nThermal Shutdown  \nThermal protection is design ed to protect the die \nagainst overheating damage. If the junction \ntemperature exceeds T JSD threshold, the switching \nstops and the device shuts down. Automatic recovery \nwith a soft -start will begin when the junction \ntemperature drops below the 135℃  falling threshold.  \n  \n3A High Efficiency  \nSGM 61030  Synchronous  Buck  Converte r \n \n \n 14 \nSEPTEMBER 2022 \n SG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION  \nIn this section,  power supply design with the SGM61030 synchronous Buck  converter and selection of the external \ncomponent will be explained based on the typical application that is applicable for various input and output voltage \ncombinat ions.  \nVIN\n2.5V to 5.5VC1\n10μFR1\n200kΩ \nR2\n100kΩ R3\n1MΩ L1\n0.47μH\nC3\n22μFVOUT\n1.8V\nPower GoodSGM61030\nPGFBVIN\nEN\nGNDSW\nC4\n22μFC2\n6pF\n \nFigure 3.

Place \nthis capacitor right beside the VIN and GND pi ns. A \n10μF ceramic capacitor with X5R or better dielectric \nand 0805 or smaller size is sufficient in most cases. A \nlarger value can be selected to reduce the input current \nripple.  Inductor Selection (L)  \nThe important factors for inductor selection are \ninductance (L), saturation current (I SAT), RMS rating \n(IRMS), DC resistance (DCR) and dimensions. Use \nEquation 1 to find the inductor peak current (I L_MAX) and \npeak -to-peak ripple current (∆I L) in static conditions:  \n= +L\nL_MAX O_MAXΔIII2            (1)  \n−= ××L OUT\nSW1DΔIVLf            (2)  \nIO_MAX is the maximum load current, D  = VOUT/VIN represents  \nduty cycle and f SW is the switching frequency.  \nISAT should be higher than I L_MAX , and sufficient margin \nshould be reserved.  Typically, the saturation current \nabove high- side current limit is enough, and a 10% to \n30% ripple current is selected to calculate the \ninductance.  Larger inductance values reduce the ripple \ncurrent but lead to sluggish transient response.  \nOutput Capacitor Selection (C OUT) \nThis device is capable to operate with low ESR ceramic \ncapacitors to get low voltage ripple and fast response. \nTwo 22μF  capacitor s with X7R or X5R dielectric type \nare recommended. If an output capacitor larger than \n150μF is used, appropriate startup current reduction \nshould be considered to avoid current limiting or false \ntriggering of the short -circuit protection during startup.  \nOutput Voltage Setting \nUse Equation 2  to select the R 1/R2 resistor divider to \nset the V OUT.
