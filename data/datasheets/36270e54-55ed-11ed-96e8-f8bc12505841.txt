Housed in a PDIP−7 or SOT−223\npackage, the NCP101X offers everything needed to build a rugged and\nlow−cost power supply, including soft−start, frequency jittering,\nshort−circuit protection, skip−cycle, a maximum peak current setpointand a Dynamic Self−Supply (no need for an auxiliary winding).\nUnlike other monolithic solutions, the NCP101X is quiet by nature:\nduring nominal load operation, the part switches at one of the available\nfrequencies (65 − 100 − 130 kHz). When the current setpoint fallsbelow a given value, e.g. the output power demand diminishes, the IC\nautomatically enters the so−called skip−cycle mode and provides\nexcellent efficiency at light loads. Because this occurs at typically 1/4\nof the maximum peak value, no acoustic noise takes place. As a result,standby power is reduced to the minimum without acoustic noisegeneration.\nShort−circuit detection takes place when the feedback signal fades\naway, e.g. in true short−circuit conditions or in broken Optocouplercases. External disabling is easily done either simply by pulling the\nfeedback pin down or latching it to ground through an inexpensive\nSCR for complete latched−off. Finally soft−start and frequencyjittering further ease the designer task to quickly develop low−cost and\nrobust offline power supplies.\nFor improved standby performance, the connection of an auxiliary\nwinding stops the DSS operation and helps to consume less than100 mW at high line. In this mode, a built−in latched overvoltageprotection prevents from lethal voltage runaways in case the\nOptocoupler would brake. These devices are available in ec onomical\n8−pin dual−in−line and 4−pin SOT−223 packages.\nFeatures\n•Built−in 700 V MOSFET with Typical R DSon of 11 /C0087\nand 22 /C0087\n•Large Creepage Distance Between High−V oltage Pins\n•Current−Mode Fixed Frequency Operation:\n65 kHz – 100 kHz − 130 kHz\n•Skip−Cycle Operation at Low Peak Currents Only: No Acoustic Noise!\n•Dynamic Self−Supply, No Need for an Auxiliary\nWinding\n•Internal 1.0 ms Soft−Start\n•Latched Overvoltage Protection with AuxiliaryWinding Operation\n•Frequency Jittering for Better EMI Signature•Auto−Recovery Internal Output Short−CircuitProtection\n•Below 100 mW Standby Power if Auxiliary Windingis Used\n•Internal Temperature Shutdown\n•Direct Optocoupler Connection\n•SPICE Models Available for TRANsient Analysis\n•These are Pb−Free and Halide−Free Devices\nTypical Applications\n•Low Power AC/DC Adapters for Chargers\n•Auxiliary Power Supplies (USB, Appliances,TVs, etc.)PDIP−7\nCASE 626A\nAP SUFFIX\n18MARKING \nDIAGRAMS\nP101xAPyy\nAWL\nYYWWG\n1SOT−223\nCASE 318E\nST SUFFIX 14AYW\n101xy /C0071\n/C0071\n14\nx = Current Limit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\ny = Oscillator Frequency\nA (65 kHz), B (100 kHz), C (130 kHz)\nyy = 06 (65 kHz), 10 (100 kHz), 13 (130 kHz)A = Assembly LocationWL = Wafer Lot\nYY, Y = Year\nWW, W = Work Week\n/C0071 or G = Pb−Free Package\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information in the package\ndimensions section on page 21 of this data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATION\nNCP1010, NCP1011, NCP1012, NCP1013, NCP1014\nwww. onsemi.com\n21 VCC 8GND\n2 NC\n3 GND\n4 FB7GND\n5DRAIN\n(Top View)PIN CONNECTIONS\nPDIP−7SOT−223\n(Top View)1\n2\n34VCC\nFB\nDRAINGND\nIndicative Maximum Output Power from NCP1014\nRDSon  − Ip 230 Vac 100 − 250 Vac\n11 /C0087 − 450 mA DSS 14 W 6.0 W\n11 /C0087 − 450 mA Auxiliary Winding 19 W 8.0 W\n1.

The component integrates everythingneeded to build a rugged and low−cost Switch−Mode Power\nSupply (SMPS) featuring low standby power. The Quick\nSelection Table on Page 2, details the differences betweenreferences, mainly peak current setpoints and operatingfrequency.\nNo need for an auxiliary winding:  onsemi  Very High\nV oltage Integrated Circuit technology lets you supply the IC\ndirectly from the high−voltage DC rail. We call it Dynamic\nSelf−Supply (DSS). This solution simplifies the transformer\ndesign and ensures a better control of the SMPS in difficult\noutput conditions, e.g. constant current operations.However, for improved standby performance, an auxiliarywinding can be connected to the V\nCC pin to disable the DSS\noperation.\nShort−cir cuit protection:  By permanently monitoring the\nfeedback line activity, the IC is able to detect the presence of\na short−circuit, immediately reducing the output power fora total system protection. Once the short has disappeared, thecontroller resumes and goes back to normal operation.\nFail−safe optocoupler and OVP:  When an auxiliary\nwinding is connected to the V\nCC pin, the device stops its\ninternal Dynamic Self−Supply and takes its operating power\nfrom the auxiliary winding. A 8.7 V active clamp isconnected between V\nCC and ground. In case the current\ninjected in this clamp exceeds a level of 7.4 mA (typical),the controller immediately latches off and stays in thisposition until V\nCC cycles down to 3.0 V (e.g. unplugging the\nconverter from the wall). By adjusting a limiting resistor in\nseries with the V CC terminal, it becomes possible to\nimplement an overvoltage protection function, latching offthe circuit in case of broken optocoupler or feedback loopproblems.\nLow standby−power:  If SMPS naturally exhibits a good\nefficiency at nominal load, it begins to be less efficient when\nthe output power demand diminishes. By skipping unneededswitching cycles, the NCP101X drastically reduces thepower wasted during light load conditions. An auxiliarywinding can further help decreasing the standby power toextremely low levels by invalidating the DSS operation.Typical measurements show results below 80 mW @\n230 Vac for a typical 7.0 W universal power supply.No acoustic noise while operating:  Instead of skipping\ncycles at high peak currents, the NCP101X waits until thepeak current demand falls below a fixed 1/4 of the maximum\nlimit. As a result, cycle skipping can take place without\nhaving a singing transformer … You can thus select cheap\nmagnetic components free of noise problems.\nSPICE model:  A dedicated model to run transient\ncycle−by−cycle simulations is available but also an\naveraged version to help close the loop. Ready−to−use\ntemplates can be downloaded in OrCAD’s PSpice, and\nINTUSOFT’s IsSpice4 from ON Semiconductor web site,NCP101X related section.\nDynamic Self−Supply\nWhen the power supply is first powered from the mains\noutlet, the internal current source (typically 8.0 mA) isbiased and charges up the V\nCC capacitor from the drain pin.\nOnce the voltage on this V CC capacitor reaches the VCC OFF\nlevel (typically 8.5 V), the current source turns off and\npulses are delivered by the output stage: the circuit is awake\nand activates the power MOSFET. Figure 15 details theinternal circuitry.\nFigure 15.

When the DSS controller\ndetects that V CC has reached 7.5 V (VCC ON), it activates the\ninternal current source to bring V CC toward 8.5 V and stops\nagain: a cycle takes place whose low frequency depends on\nthe V CC capacitor and the IC consumption. A 1.0 V ripple\ntakes place on the V CC pin whose average value equals\n(VCC OFF + VCC ON)/2. Figure 16 portrays a typical\noperation of the DSS.\nAs one can see, the V CC capacitor shall be dimensioned to\noffer an adequate startup time, i.e. ensure regulation isreached before V\nCC crosses 7.5 V (otherwise the part enters\nthe fault condition mode). If we know that /C0068V = 1.0 V\nand ICC1 (max) is 1.1 mA (for instance we selected an 11 /C0087\ndevice switching at 65 kHz), then the V CC capacitor can\nbe calculated using: C/C0119ICC1 · tstartup\n/C0068V(eq. 1) . Let’s\nsuppose that the SMPS needs 10 ms to startup, then we will\ncalculate C to offer a 15 ms period. As a result, C should be\ngreater than 20 /C0109F thus the selection of a 33 /C0109F/16 V\ncapacitor is appropriate.\nShort Circuit Protection\nThe internal protection circuitry involves a patented\narrangement that permanently monitors the assertion of aninternal error flag. This error flag is, in fact, a signal thatinstructs the controller that the internal maximum peakcurrent limit is reached. This naturally occurs during thestartup period (V out is not stabilized to the target value) orwhen the optocoupler LED is no longer biased, e.g. in a\nshort−circuit condition or when the feedback network is\nbroken. When the DSS normally operates, the logic checksfor the presence of the error flag every time V\nCC crosses\nVCC ON. If the error flag is low (peak limit not active) then\nthe IC works normally. If the error signal is active, then the\nNCP101X immediately stops the output pulses, reduces its\ninternal current consumption and does not allow the startup\nsource to activate: V CC drops toward ground until it reaches\nthe so−called latch−off level, where the current sourceactivates again to attempt a new restart. When the error isgone, the IC automatically resumes its operation. If thedefault is still there, the IC pulses during 8.5 V down to 7.5 V\nand enters a new latch−off phase. The resulting burst\noperation guarantees a low average power dissipation and\nlets the SMPS sustain a permanent short−circuit. Figure 17shows the corresponding diagram.\nFigure 17.

In Flyback−based converters, this drain level caneasily go above 600 V peak and thus increase the stress on theDSS startup source. However, the drain voltage evolves withtime and its period is small comp ared to that of the DSS. As\na result, the averaged dissipation, excluding capacitive losses,\ncan be derived by: \nPDSS/C0043ICC1 · /C0116Vds(t)/C0117.(eq. 4) .\nFigure 19 portrays a typical drain−ground waveshape where\nleakage effects have been removed.Figure 19.

With ICC1 = 1.1 mA (65 kHz version), we canexpect a DSS dissipation around 407 mW. If you select ahigher switching frequency version, the ICC1 increases and\nit is likely that the DSS consumption exceeds that number.\nIn that case, we recommend to add an auxiliary winding in\norder to of fer more dissipation room to the power MOSFET.\nPlease read application note AND8125/D, “Evaluating\nthe Power Capability of the NCP101X Members” to help in\nselecting the right part/configuration for your application.\nLowering the Standby Power with an Auxiliary Winding\nThe DSS operation can bother the designer when its\ndissipation is too high and extremely low standby power isa must. In both cases, one can connect an auxiliary windingto disable the self−supply. The current source then ensuresthe startup sequence only and stays in the off state as long as\nV\nCC does not drop below VCC ON or 7.5 V. Figure 20  shows\nthat the insertion of a resistor (Rlimit) between the auxiliary\nDC level and the V CC pin is mandatory to not damage the\ninternal 8.7 V active Zener diode during an overshoot forinstance (absolute maximum current is 15 mA) and toimplement the fail−safe optocoupler protection as offered by\nthe active clamp. Please note that there cannot be badinteraction between the clamping voltage of the internalZener and VCC\nOFF since this clamping voltage is actually\nbuilt on top of VCC OFF with a fixed amount of offset\n(200 mV typical).\nSelf−supplying controllers in extremely low standby\napplications often puzzles the designer. Actually, if a SMPS\noperated at nominal load can deliver an auxiliary voltage of\nan arbitrary 16 V (Vnom), this voltage can drop to below10 V (Vstby) when entering standby. This is because therecurrence of the switching pulses expands so much that the\nlow frequency refueling rate of the V\nCC capacitor is not\nenough to keep a constant auxiliary voltage. Figure 21\nportrays a typical scope shot of a SMPS entering deepstandby (output unloaded). So care must be taken whencalculating Rlimit 1) to not trigger the V\nCC over current\nlatch [by injecting 6.3 mA (min. value) into the activeclamp] in normal operation but 2) not to drop too muchvoltage over Rlimit when entering standby. Otherwise theDSS could reactivate and the standby performance would\ndegrade. We are thus able to bound Rlimit between two\nequations:\nVnom/C0042Vclamp\nItrip/C0118Rlimit/C0118Vstby/C0042VCC ON\nICC1(eq. 10)\nWhere:\nVnom  is the auxiliary voltage at nominal load.\nVstdby  is the auxiliary voltage when standby is entered.Itrip  is the current corresponding to the nominal operation.\nIt must be selected to avoid false tripping in overshootconditions.\nICC1  is the controller consumption. This number slightly\ndecreases compared to ICC1 from the spec since the part in\nstandby almost does not switch.\nVCC\nON is the level above which Vaux must be maintained\nto keep the DSS in the OFF mode. It is good to shoot around8.0 V in order to of fer an adequate design margin, e.g. to not\nreactivate the startup source (which is not a problem in itself\nif low standby power does not matter).\nSince Rlimit shall not bother the controller in standby, e.g.\nkeep V aux to around 8.0 V (as selected above), we purposely\nselect a Vnom well above this value. As explained before,\nexperience shows that a 40% decrease can be seen on\nauxiliary windings from nominal operation down to standby\nmode. Let’s select a nominal auxiliary winding of 20 V tooffer sufficient margin regarding 8.0 V when in standby(Rlimit also drops voltage in standby …). Plugging the\nvalues in Equation 10 gives the limits within which Rlimitshall be selected:\n20/C00428.7\n6.3 m/C0118Rlimit/C011812/C00428\n1.1 m(eq. 11 )1.8 k/C0116Rlimit/C01163.6 k, that is to say:\nIf we design a power supply delivering 12 V, then the ratio\nbetween auxiliary and power must be: 12/20 = 0.6. The OVP\nlatch will activate when the clamp current exceeds 6.3 mA.\nThis will occur when Vaux increases to: 8.7 V + 1.8 k x(6.4m + 1.1m) = 22.2 V for the first boundary or 8.7 V +3.6 k x (6.4m +1.1m) = 35.7 V for second boundary. On the\npower output, it will respectively give 22.2 x 0.6 = 13.3 Vand 35.7 x 0.6 = 21.4 V.  As one can see, tweaking the Rlimit\nvalue will allow the selection of a given overvoltage output\nlevel. Theoretically predicting the auxiliary drop from\nnominal to standby is an almost impossible exercise since\nmany parameters are involved, including the converter time\nconstants. Fine tuning of Rlimit thus requires a fewiterations and experiments on a breadboard to check Vauxvariations but also output voltage excursion in fault. Onceproperly adjusted, the fail−safe protection will prec lude any\nlethal voltage runaways in case a problem would occur in the\nfeedback loop.\nWhen an OVP occurs, all switching pulses are\npermanently disabled, the output voltage thus drops to zero.\nThe V\nCC cycles up and down between 8.5–4.7 V and stays\nin this state until the user unplugs the power supply andforces V\nCC to drop below 3.0 V (VCC reset). Below this\nvalue, the internal OVP latch is reset and when the highvoltage is reapplied, a new startup sequence can take placein an attempt to restart the converter.\nNCP1010, NCP1011, NCP1012, NCP1013, NCP1014\nwww. onsemi.com\n12Figure 20.

The noise takes its origins\nin the resonance of the transformer mechanical structurewhich is excited by the skipping pulses. A possible\nsolution, successfully implemented in the NCP1200 series,also authorizes skip−cycle but only when the power\ndemand has dropped below a given level. At this time, the\npeak current is reduced and no noise can be heard.Figure 22 pictures the peak current evolution of theNCP101X entering standby.\nNCP1010, NCP1011, NCP1012, NCP1013, NCP1014\nwww. onsemi.com\n13Figure 22. Low Peak Current Skip−Cycle Guarantees Noise−Free Operation100%Peak current\nat nominal power\n25%Skip−cycle\ncurrent limit\nFull power operation involves the nominal switching\nfrequency and thus avoids any noise when running.\nExperiments carried on a 5.0 W universal mains board\nunveiled a standby power of 300 mW @ 230 Vac with the\nDSS activated and dropped to less than 100 mW when anauxiliary winding is connected.\nFrequency Jittering for Improved EMI Signature\nBy sweeping the switching frequency around its nominal\nvalue, it spreads the energy content on adjacent frequencies\nrather than keeping it centered in one single ray. This of fersthe benefit to artificially reduce the measurement noise on\na standard EMI receiver and pass the tests more easily. TheEMI sweep is implemented by routing the V\nCC ripple\n(induced by the DSS activity) to the internal oscillator. As a\nresult, the switching frequency moves up and down to theDSS rhythm. Typical deviation is /C00343.3% of the nominal\nfrequency. W ith a 1.0 V peak−to−peak ripple, the frequency\nwill equal 65 kHz in the middle of the ripple and willincrease as V\nCC rises or decrease as V CC ramps down.\nFigure 23 portrays the behavior we have adopted.\nFigure 23. The V CC ripple is used to introduce a frequency jittering on the internal oscillator sawtooth.\nHere, a 65 kHz version was selected.VCC RippleVCC OFF\n67.15 kHz\n65 kHz\n62.85 kHz\nVCC ONInternal Sawtooth\nNCP1010, NCP1011, NCP1012, NCP1013, NCP1014\nwww. onsemi.com\n14Soft−Start\nThe NCP101X features an internal 1.0 ms soft−start\nactivated during the power on sequence (PON). As soon as\nVCC reaches VCC OFF, the peak current is gradually\nincreased from nearly zero up to the maximum internal\nclamping level (e.g. 350 mA). This situation lasts 1.0 msand further to that time period, the peak current limit isblocked to the maximum until the supply enters regulation.\nThe soft−start is also activated during the over current burst(OCP) sequence. Every restart attempt is followed by a\nsoft−start activation. Generally speaking, the soft−start will\nbe activated when V\nCC ramps up either from zero (fresh\npower−on sequence) or 4.7 V , the latch−off voltage\noccurring during OCP. Figure 24 portrays the soft−startbehavior. The time scales are purposely shifted to offer abetter zoom portion.\nFigure 24.

This option can easily be accomplished\nthrough a single NPN bipolar transistor wired between FBand ground. By pulling FB below the internal skip level\n(Vskip), the output pulses are disabled. As soon as FB isrelaxed, the IC resumes its operation. Figure 25  depicts the\napplication example.\nFigure 25.

This feature can easily be implemented\nthrough two external transistors wired as a discrete SCR.\nWhen the OVP level exceeds the Zener breakdownvoltage, the NPN biases the PNP and fires the equivalent\nSCR, permanently bringing down the FB pin. Theswitching pulses are disabled until the user unplugs the\npower supply.\nFigure 26.

The bias\ncurrent flowing through Rhold should be small enough to let\nthe V CC ramp up (8.5 V) and down (7.5 V) when the SCR\nis fired. The NPN base can also receive a signal from a\ntemperature sensor. Typical bipolars can be MMBT2222and MMBT2907 for the discrete latch. The MMBT3946features two bipolars NPN+PNP in the same package andcould also be used.\nPower Dissipation and Heatsinking\nThe NCP101X welcomes two dissipating terms, the DSS\ncurrent−source (when active) and the MOSFET. Thus,\nPtot = P DSS + P MOSFET . When the PDIP−7 package is\nsurrounded by copper, it becomes possible to drop its\nthermal resistance junction−to−ambient, R /C0113JA down\nto 75 °C/W and thus dissipate more power. Themaximum power the device can thus evacuate is:\nPmax/C0043TJmax/C0042Tambmax\nR/C0113JA(eq. 12) which gives around\n1.0 W for an ambient of 50 °C. The losses inherent to the\nMOSFET R DSon can be evaluated using the following\nformula: Pmos/C00431\n3·I p2·d·R DSon(eq. 13) , where Ip\nis the worse case peak current (at the lowest line input), d is\nthe converter operating duty−cycle and R DSon, the\nMOSFET resistance for T J = 100 °C. This formula is only\nvalid for Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM)operation where the turn−on losses are null (the primary\ncurrent is zero when you restart the MOSFET). Figure 27\ngives a possible layout to help drop the thermal resistance.\nWhen measured on a 35 /C0109m (1 oz) copper thickness PCB,\nwe obtained a thermal resistance of 75 °C/W.\nFigure 27. A Possible PCB Arrangement to Reduce the Thermal Resistance Junction−to−Ambient\n\nNCP1010, NCP1011, NCP1012, NCP1013, NCP1014\nwww. onsemi.com\n16Design Procedure\nThe design of an SMPS around a monolithic device does\nnot differ from that of a standard circuit using a controllerand a MOSFET. However, one needs to be aware of certain\ncharacteristics specific of monolithic devices:\nFigure 28. The Drain−Source Wave Shall Always be Positive . . .1.004M 1.011M 1.018M 1.025M 1.032M−50.050.0150250350\n> 0 !!\n1. In any case, the lateral MOSFET body−diode shall\nnever be forward biased, either during startup(because of a large leakage inductance) or in\nnormal operation as shown by Figure 28.\nAs a result, the Flyback voltage which is reflected on the\ndrain at the switch opening cannot be larger than the inputvoltage. When selecting components, you thus must adopta turn ratio which adheres to the following equation:\nN · (Vout /C0041Vf)/C0116Vinmin(eq. 14) . For instance, if\noperating from a 120 V DC rail, with a delivery of 12 V, we\ncan select a reflected voltage of 100 Vdc maximum:120–100 > 0. Therefore, the turn ratio Np:Ns must besmaller than 100/(12 + 1) = 7.7 or Np:Ns < 7.7. We will see\nlater on how it affects the calculation.\n2. A current−mode architecture is, by definition,\nsensitive to subharmonic oscillations.\nSubharmonic oscillations only occur when theSMPS is operating in Continuous ConductionMode (CCM) together with a duty−cycle greaterthan 50%. As a result, we recommend to operatethe device in DCM only, whatever duty−cycle itimplies (max = 65%). However, CCM operationwith duty−cycles below 40% is possible.\n3. Lateral MOSFETs have a poorly dopped\nbody−diode which naturally limits their ability tosustain the avalanche. A traditional RCD clampingnetwork shall thus be installed to protect theMOSFET. In some low power applications,a simple capacitor can also be used since\nVdrain max /C0043Vin/C0041N · (Vout /C0041Vf)/C0041Ip ·Lf\nCtot/C0504\n(eq. 15) , where Lf is the leakage inductance,Ctot is the total capacitance at the drain node\n(which is increased by the capacitor wired betweendrain and source), N the Np:Ns turn ratio, V out the\noutput voltage, Vf the secondary diode forward\ndrop and finally, Ip the maximum peak current.Worse case occurs when the SMPS is very close toregulation, e.g. the V out target is almost reachedand Ip is still pushed to the maximum.\nTaking into account all previous remarks, it becomes\npossible to calculate the maximum power that can betransferred at low line.\nWhen the switch closes, Vin is applied across the primary\ninductance Lp until the current reaches the level imposed by\nthe feedback loop. The duration of this event is called the ONtime and can be defined by:\nton/C0043Lp · Ip\nVin(eq. 16)\nAt the switch opening, the primary energy is transferred\nto the secondary and the flyback voltage appears acrossLp, resetting the transformer core with a slope of\nN · (Vout /C0041Vf)\nLp. toff, the OFF time is thus:\ntoff/C0043Lp · Ip\nN · (Vout /C0041Vf)(eq. 17)\nIf one wants to keep DCM only, but still need to pass the\nmaximum power, we will not allow a dead−time after thecore is reset, but rather immediately restart. The switchingtime can be expressed by:\nTsw/C0043toff/C0041ton/C0043Lp · Ip ·/C04661\nVin/C00411\nN · (Vout /C0041Vf)/C0467\n(eq. 18)\nNCP1010, NCP1011, NCP1012, NCP1013, NCP1014\nwww. onsemi.com\n17The Flyback transfer formula dictates that:\nPout\n/C0104/C00431\n2·L p·I p 2·F s w (eq. 19)  which, by extracting\nIp and plugging into Equation 19, leads to:\nTsw/C0043Lp2 · Pout\n/C0104·F s w·L p/C0504 ·/C04661\nVin/C00411\nN · (Vout /C0041Vf)/C0467\n(eq. 20 )\nExtracting Lp from Equation 20 gives:\nLpcritical/C0043(Vin · Vr) 2·/C0104\n2·F s w·[ P o u t·( V r 2/C00412·V r·V i n /C0041Vin2)]\n(eq. 21) , with Vr = N . (V out + Vf) and /C0104 the efficiency.\nIf Lp critical gives the inductance value above which\nDCM operation is lost, there is another expression we can\nwrite to connect Lp, the primary peak current bounded by\nthe NCP101X and the maximum duty−cycle that needs tostay below 50%:\nLpmax /C0043DCmax · Vinmin · Tsw\nIpmax(eq. 22)  where V inmin\ncorresponds to the lowest rectified bulk voltage, hence the\nlongest ton duration or largest duty−cycle. Ip max is the\navailable peak current from the considered part, e.g. 350 mA\ntypical for the NCP1013 (however, the minimum value ofthis parameter shall be considered for reliable evaluation).Combining Equations 21 and 22 gives the maximumtheoretical power you can pass respecting the peak currentcapability of the NCP101X, the maximum duty−cycle andthe discontinuous mode operation:\nPmax :/C0043Tsw2· Vinmin 2·V r2·/C0104·\n(eq. 23)Fsw\n(2 · Lpmax · Vr 2/C00414 · Lpmax · Vr · Vinmin\n/C00412 · Lpmax · Vinmin 2)\nFrom Equation 22 we obtain the operating duty−cycle\nd/C0043Ip · Lp\nVin · Tsw(eq. 24)  which lets us calculate the RMS\ncurrent circulating in the MOSFET:\nIdRMS /C0043Ip ·d\n3/C0504 (eq. 25) . From this equation, we\nobtain the average dissipation in the MOSFET:\nPavg/C00431\n3·I p2·d·R DSon(eq. 26)  to which switching\nlosses shall be added.\nIf we stick to Equation 23, compute Lp and follow the\nabove calculations, we will discover that a power supplybuilt with the NCP101X and operating from a 100 Vac lineminimum will not be able to deliver more than 7.0 Wcontinuous, regardless of the selected switching frequency(however the transformer core size will go down asFswitching is increased). This number increases\nsignificantly when operated from a single European mains\n(18 W).

Once the Bulk capacitor hasbeen selected, one should check that the resulting ripple (minVbulk?) is still compatible with the above calculations. As anexample, to benefit from the largest operating range, a 7.0 W\nboard was built with a 47 /C0109F bulk capacitor which ensured\ndiscontinuous operation even in the ripple minimum waves.\nNCP1010, NCP1011, NCP1012, NCP1013, NCP1014\nwww. onsemi.com\n18MOSFET Protection\nAs in any Flyback design, it is important to limit the\ndrain excursion to a safe value, e.g. below the MOSFETBVDSS which is 700 V . Figure 29 presents possible\nimplementations:\nFigure 29.

This option is only valid for lowpower applications, e.g. below 5.0 W, otherwise chances\nexist to destroy the MOSFET. After evaluating the leakage\ninductance, you can compute C with Equation 15. Typicalvalues are between 100 pF and up to 470 pF. Largecapacitors increase capacitive losses.\nFigure 29B : This diagram illustrates the most standard\ncircuitry called the RCD network. Rclamp and Cclamp are\ncalculated using the following formulas:\nRclamp /C00432 · Vclamp · (Vclamp /C0042(Vout/C0041Vf sec) · N)\nLleak · Ip 2·F s w(eq. 27)\nCclamp /C0043Vclamp\nVripple · Fsw · Rclamp(eq. 28)\nVclamp is usually selected 50−80 V above the reflected\nvalue N x (V out + Vf). The diode needs to be a fast one and\na MUR160 represents a good choice. One major drawbackof the RCD network lies in its dependency upon the peakcurrent. Worse case occurs when Ip and Vin are maximumand V out is close to reach the steady−state value.Figure 29C : This option is probably the most expensive of\nall three but it offers the best protection degree. If you needa very precise clamping level, you must implement a Zener\ndiode or a TVS. There are little technology differences\nbehind a standard Zener diode and a TVS. However, the die\narea is far bigger for a transient suppressor than that of Zener.\nA 5.0 W Zener diode like the 1N5388B will accept 180 Wpeak power if it lasts less than 8.3 ms. If the peak current in\nthe worse case (e.g. when the PWM circuit maximumcurrent limit works) multiplied by the nominal Zenervoltage exceeds these 180 W, then the diode will be\ndestroyed when the supply experiences overloads. A\ntransient suppressor like the P6KE200 still dissipates 5.0 W\nof continuous power but is able to accept surges up to 600 W@ 1.0 ms. Select the Zener or TVS clamping level between40 to 80 V above the reflected output voltage when thesupply is heavily loaded.\nNCP1010, NCP1011, NCP1012, NCP1013, NCP1014\nwww. onsemi.com\n19Typical Application Examples\nA 6.5 W NCP1012−Based Flyback Converter\nFigure 30 shows a converter built with a NCP1012\ndelivering 6.5 W from a universal input.

We can increase the outputpower since an auxiliary winding is used, the DSS is\ndisabled, and thus offering more room for the MOSFET. In\nthis application, the feedback is made via a TLV431 whose\nlow bias current (100 /C0109A min) helps to lower the no−load\nstandby power.\nFigure 32.
