INTRODUCTION\nThe MR4A16B is a 16,777,216-bit magnetoresistive random access memory \n(MRAM) device organized as 1,048,576 words of 16 bits. The MR4A16B offers \nSRAM compatible 35 ns read/write timing with unlimited endurance. Data \nis always non-volatile for greater than 20 years. Data is automatically pro -\ntected on power loss by low-voltage inhibit circuitry to prevent writes with voltage out of specification.  To \nsimplify fault tolerant design, the MR4A16B includes internal single bit error correction code with 7 ECC \nparity bits for every 64 data bits.  The MR4A16B is the ideal memory solution for applications that must \npermanently store and retrieve critical data and programs quickly.\nThe MR4A16B   is available in a small footprint 48-pin ball grid array (BGA) package and a 54-pin thin small \noutline package (TSOP Type 2). These packages are compatible with similar low-power SRAM products and \nother nonvolatile RAM products.\nThe MR4A16B  provides highly reliable data storage over a wide range of temperatures. The product is \noffered with commercial temperature (0 to +70 °C), and industrial temperature (-40 to +85 °C) operating \ntemperature options.MR4A16B\n1M x 16 MRAMFEATURES\n• +3.3 Volt power supply \n• Fast 35 ns read/write cycle\n• SRAM compatible timing\n• Unlimited read & write endurance\n• Data always non-volatile for >20 years at temperature\n• RoHS-compliant small footprint BGA and TSOP2 package \n• All products meet MSL-3 moisture sensitivity level\nBENEFITS\n• One memory replaces FLASH, SRAM, EEPROM and BBSRAM in systems \nfor simpler, more efficient designs\n• Improves reliability by replacing battery-backed SRAM\nRoHS\nCONTENTS\n1.

Precautions should be taken\nto avoid application of any magnetic field greater than the maximum field intensity specified\nin the maximum ratings. \nSymbol Parameter Conditions Value Unit\nVDDSupply voltage2 -0.5 to 4.0 V\nVINVoltage on an pin 2 -0.5 to VDD + 0.5 V\nIOUTOutput current per pin ±20 mA\nPDPackage power dissipation 30.600 W\nTBIASTemperature under biasCommercial -10 to 85 °C\nIndustrial -45 to 95 °C\nTstgStorage Temperature -55 to 150 °C\nTLeadLead temperature during solder (3 \nminute max)260 °C\nHmax_writeMaximum magnetic field During Write\n8000 A/m\nHmax_readMaximum magnetic field During Read or Standby\n1  Permanent device damage may occur if absolute maximum ratings are exceeded. Functional operation \nshould be restricted to recommended operating conditions. Exposure to excessive voltages or magnetic \nfields could affect device reliability.\n2  All voltages are referenced to VSS. The DC value of VIN must not exceed actual applied VDD  by more than \n0.5V. The AC value of VIN must not exceed applied  VDD by more than 2V for 10ns with  IIN limited to less than \n20mA.\n3 Power dissipation capability depends on package characteristics and use environment.Table 2.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings 1MR4A16B\nMR4A16B  Rev. 11.7  3/20185\nCopyright © 2018 Everspin Technologies, Inc.

See Power Up and Power Down Sequencing below.\n2 VIH(max) = VDD + 0.3 VDC ;  VIH(max) = VDD + 2.0 VAC (pulse width ≤ 10 ns) for I ≤ 20.0 mA.\n3 VIL(min) = -0.5 VDC ; VIL(min) = -2.0 VAC (pulse width ≤ 10 ns) for I ≤ 20.0 mA.Table 2.2 Operating Conditions\nPower Up and Power Down Sequencing\nThe MRAM is protected from write operations whenever VDD is less than VWI. As soon as VDD exceeds VDD(min), \nthere is a startup time of 2 ms before read or write operations can start. This time allows memory power \nsupplies to stabilize. \nThe E and W control signals should track VDD on power up to VDD- 0.2 V or VIH (whichever is lower) and remain \nhigh for the startup time. In most systems, this means that these signals should be pulled up with a resis -\ntor so that a signal remains high if the driving signal is Hi-Z during power up. Any logic that drives E and W \nshould hold the signals high with a power-on reset signal for longer than the startup time. \nDuring power loss or brownout where VDD goes below VWI, writes are protected and a startup time must be \nobserved when power returns above VDD(min).\nFigure 2.1  Power Up and Power Down DiagramMR4A16B Electrical Specifications\nBROWNOUT or  POWER LOSS\nNORMAL\n OPERATIONVDD\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITEDVWI\n2 ms\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITED\nVIH STARTUP\nNORMAL\n OPERATION2 ms\nE\nWRECOVER\nVIH \nMR4A16B  Rev. 11.7  3/20186\nCopyright © 2018 Everspin Technologies, Inc.

### Component Summary: MR4A16BCYS35R

**Description:**
The MR4A16B is a 16,777,216-bit Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) device, organized as 1,048,576 words of 16 bits. It offers SRAM-compatible read/write timing of 35 ns with unlimited endurance, making it suitable for applications requiring non-volatile memory with fast access times. The data retention is guaranteed for over 20 years, and the device includes built-in error correction capabilities.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VDD): 3.0V to 3.6V
  - Write Inhibit Voltage (VWI): 2.5V to 3.0V
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Active Supply Current (Read): 60 mA (typical), 68 mA (max)
  - Active Supply Current (Write): 152 mA (typical), 180 mA (max)
  - Standby Current: 9 mA (typical), 14 mA (max)
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Power Dissipation: 30.6 W (max)
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Commercial: 0°C to +70°C
  - Industrial: -40°C to +85°C
- **Package Type:**
  - Available in 48-pin Ball Grid Array (BGA) and 54-pin Thin Small Outline Package (TSOP Type 2)
- **Special Features:**
  - SRAM compatible timing
  - Unlimited read/write endurance
  - Built-in single bit error correction with 7 ECC parity bits for every 64 data bits
  - Low-voltage inhibit circuitry to protect data on power loss
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL-3 according to JEDEC J-STD-020E

**Typical Applications:**
The MR4A16B is ideal for applications that require fast, reliable, and non-volatile memory solutions. Typical applications include:
- **Data Storage:** Permanent storage of critical data and programs.
- **Embedded Systems:** Used in systems where data integrity and speed are crucial, such as automotive, industrial control, and telecommunications.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Suitable for devices that require quick access to stored data without the need for battery backup.
- **Fault-Tolerant Systems:** Its error correction capabilities make it suitable for applications where data integrity is paramount.

This component effectively replaces traditional memory types such as FLASH, SRAM, EEPROM, and battery-backed SRAM, simplifying design and improving reliability.
