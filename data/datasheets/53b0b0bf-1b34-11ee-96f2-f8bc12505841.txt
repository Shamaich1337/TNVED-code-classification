Efficiency vs. Output Current  \nGENERA L DESCRIPTION  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 are compact , constant -frequency , \ncurrent -mode , step-down dc-to-dc regulators with integrated \npower MOSFET. The ADP2300/ADP2301 devices run from \ninput voltage s of 3.0 V to 20 V,  making them suitable for  a wide \nrange of app lications. A precise, low voltage internal reference \nmakes these devices  ideal for generating a regulated output \nvoltage as low as 0.8  V, with ±2% accuracy, for up to 1.2  A load \ncurrent.  \nThere are two frequency options : the ADP2300 runs at 700 kHz, \nand th e ADP2301 runs at 1.4 MHz. These options allow users to \nmake decisions based on the trade -off between efficiency and total solution  size. Current -mode control provides fast and stable \nline and load transient performance. The ADP2300/ADP2301 \ndevice s include  internal soft  start to prevent inrush current at \npower -up. Other key safety features include short -circuit protec -\ntion, thermal shutdown (TSD) , and input under voltage lockout  \n(UVLO). The p recision enable pin threshold voltage allows the \nADP2300/ADP2301 to be easily sequenced from other input/  \noutput supplies. It can also be used as a programmable UVLO \ninput by using a resistive divider.  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 are available in a 6-lead TSOT package \nand are rated for the −40°C to +125 °C junction temperature range.  \n \nADP2300/ADP2301  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 14 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 are nonsynchronous , step-down  \ndc-to-dc regulators, each  with an integrated high- side power \nMOSFET. A high switching frequency and ultra small, 6-lead \nTSOT package allow small step -down dc -to-dc regulator  \nsolution s.  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 can operate  with an input voltage from  \n3.0 V to 20 V while  regulat ing an output voltage down to  0.8 V. \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 are available in two fixed -frequency \noptions: 700  kHz (ADP2300) and 1.4  MHz (ADP2301).  \nBASIC OPERATION  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301  use the fixed -frequency, peak current -\nmode PWM control architecture at  medium to high loads, but \nshift to a pulse -skip mode control scheme at light loads to reduce \nthe switching power losses and improve  effici ency. When the \ndevices operat e in fixed -frequency PWM mode, output regulation  \nis achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the integrated MOSFET.  \nWhen the devices operat e in pulse -skip mode at light loads, the \noutput voltage is controlled in a hysteretic m anner with higher \noutput ripple. In this mode of operation , the regulator periodi cally \nstops switching for a few cycles, thus keeping the conversion \nlosses minimal to improve  efficiency.   \nPWM MODE  \nIn PWM mode, the ADP2300/ADP2301 operate  at a fixed \nfrequen cy, set by an internal oscillator. At the start of each \noscillator cycle, the MOSFET switch is turned on, sending a \npositive voltage across the inductor. The inductor curr ent \nincreases until the current -sense signal crosses the peak \ninductor current thresh old that turns off the MOSFET switch ; \nthis threshold is set by the error amplifier output . During the \nMOSFET off time, the inductor current declines through the \nexternal diode until  the next oscillator clock pulse starts a new \ncycle. The ADP2300/ADP2301 regulate  the output voltage by \nadjusting the peak inductor current threshold.  \nPOWER SAVING MODE  \nTo achieve higher efficiency, the ADP2300/ADP2301 smoothly \ntransition to the pulse -skip mode when the output load decreases  \nbelow the pulse -skip current threshol d. When the output voltage  \ndips below regulation, the ADP2300/ADP2301  enter  PWM mode  \nfor a few oscillator cycles until the voltage increase s to within  \nregulation. During  the idle time between  bursts, the MOSFET \nswitch is turned off, and the output capacito r supplies all the \noutput current.  Since the pulse -skip mode comparator monitors the internal \ncompensation node, which represent s the peak inductor current \ninformation, the average pulse -skip load current threshold depends  \non the input voltage ( VIN), the output voltage ( VOUT), the inductor , \nand the output capacitor . \nBecause the output voltage occasionally dips below regulation \nand then recovers, the output voltage ripple in the power saving  \nmode  is larger than the ripple in the PWM mode of operation.  \nBOOT STRAP CIRCUITRY  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301  each have an integrated boot regulator, \nwhich requires  that a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor (X5R or X7R) be \nplaced between the BST and SW pins to provide the gate drive \nvoltage for the high -side MOSFET. There must be  at least  a 1.2 V \ndifference between the BST and SW pins to turn on the high- side \nMOSFET. This voltage should not exceed 5.5  V in case the BST \npin is supp lied with an  external voltage source through a diode.  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301  generate  a typical 5.0  V bootstrap vo ltage  \nfor a gate drive circuit by differentially sensing and regulating the  \nvoltage between the BST and SW pins. A  diode integrated on the  \nchip block s the reverse voltage between the VIN and BST pins \nwhen the MOSFET switch is turned on.  \nPRECISION ENABLE  \nThe ADP2300/ ADP23 01 feature a precision enable circuit  that \nhas a 1.2 V reference voltage with 100  mV hysteresis. When the \nvoltage at the EN pin is greater than 1.2  V , the part is enabled. If  the \nEN voltage falls below 1.1  V , the chip is disabled. The p recision \nenable threshold voltage allows the ADP2300/ADP2301 to be \neasily sequenced from other input/output supplies . It can  also be \nused as  programmable UVLO input by using a resistive divider.  \nAn internal 1.2  µA pull -down  current  prevent s error s if the EN pi n \nis floating.  \nINTEGRATED  SOFT START  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 include internal soft start circuitry \nthat ramps the output voltage in  a controlled manner during \nstart up, thereby limiting the inrush current. The soft start time is  \ntypically  fixed at 1460 µs for the ADP2300 and at 730 µs for the  \nADP2301.  \nCURRENT  LIMIT  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301  include  current -limit protection circuit ry \nto limit the amount of positive current flowing through the high -\nside MOSFET switch. The positive current limit on the power switch limit s the amount of current that can flow from the input \nto the output.  \nData Sheet  ADP2300/ADP2301  \n \nRev. C | Page 15 of 28 SHORT -CIRCUIT PROTECTION  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 include frequency foldback to prevent \noutput current run away when there is a hard short on the output. \nThe switching frequency is  reduced when  the voltage at the FB pin  \ndrops below a certain value, which allows more time for the \ninductor current to decline , but increases the ripple current while \nregulating the peak current. This results in a reduction in average  \noutput current and prevents outpu t current  runaway . The corre -\nlation between the switching frequency and the FB pin voltage \nis shown in Table 5. \nTable 5. Correlation Between the Switching Frequency  \nand the FB Pin Voltage  \nFB Pin Voltage  Switching Frequency  \nVFB ≥ 0.6 V fSW \n0.6 V > VFB > 0.2 V ½ fSW \nVFB ≤ 0.2 V ¼ fSW \n \nWhen a hard short (VFB ≤ 0.2  V) is removed, a soft  start cycle  \nis initiated to regulate the output back to its level during normal \noperation, which helps to limit the inrush current and prevent \npossible overshoot on the output voltage.  UNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT  (UVLO)  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 have fixed, internally set undervoltage \nlockout circuitry . If the input voltage drops below 2. 4 V,  the \nADP2300/ADP2301 shut down  and the MOSFET switch turn s \noff. Afte r the voltage rises again above 2.8 V, the soft start \nperiod is initiated, and the part is enabled.  \nTHERMAL SHUT DOWN  \nIf the ADP2300/ADP2301  junction temperature rises above 140 °C, \nthe thermal shutdown circuit disables the chip. Extreme junction temperature  can be the result of  high current operation , poor \ncircuit board design , or high ambient temperature. A 15° C \nhysteresis is included so that when thermal shutdown occurs, the ADP2300/ADP2301  do not return to operation until the on -\nchip temperature drops bel ow 125°C. After  the devices recover \nfrom thermal shutdown, a soft start is initiated.  \nCONTROL LOOP  \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301  are internally compensated to minimize  \nexternal component count and cost. In addition,  the built -in \nslope compensation  helps to prevent s ubharmonic oscillations  \nwhen the ADP2300/ADP2301 operat e at a duty cycle greater \nthan or close to 50%.  \n \nADP2300/ADP2301  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

For best performance, use inductor \nvalues between 2 μH and 10 μH  for ADP2301, and use inductor \nvalues between 2 μH and 22 μH for ADP2300.  \nThe peak -to-peak inductor current ripple is calculated using the \nfollowing equation:  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n++××−=∆\nD IND OUT\nswOUT IN\nRIPPLEV VV V\nfLV VI) ( \nwhere:  \nfSW is the switching frequency.  \nL is the inductor value.  \nVD is the diode forward drop.  \nVIN is the input voltage.  \nVOUT is the output voltage.  \nInductor s of smaller values are usually  smaller in size and less \nexpensive, but increase the ripple current and the output voltage \nripple.

For ferrite core inductors with a \nquick saturation characteristic, the inductor saturation current \nrating should be  higher than the switch current -limit threshold \nto prevent the inductor from reachin g its saturation  point . Be \nsure to validate the worst -case condition , in which there is a \nshorted output , over the intended temperature range.  \nInductor conduction losses are caused by the flow of current \nthrough the inductor, which is  associated  with the  internal dc \nresistance ( DCR ). Larger sized inductors have smaller DCR  and, \ntherefore,  may reduce inductor conduction losses. However, \ninductor core losses are also related to the core material and the   \nac flux swing, which are affected by the peak -to-peak induc - \ntor ripple current. Because the ADP2300/ADP2301 are high \nswitching frequency regulators, shielded ferrite core materials \nare recommended for their  low core losses and low EMI.

The ADP2300/ADP2301 \nare designed to operate with small ceramic capacitor s that have low  \nequivalent series resistance ( ESR) and equ ivalent series inductance \n(ESL)  and are, therefore,  easily able to meet stringent  output voltage  \nripple specifications.  \nWhen the regulator operates in forced continuous conduction \nmode, the overall  output voltage ripple is the sum of the voltage \nspike caused by the output capacitor ESR  plus the voltage ripple \ncaused by charging and discharging the output capacitor .  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+×××∆=∆\nOUTC\nOUT swRIPPLE RIPPLE ESRC fI V81 \nCapacitors with lower ESR  are preferable  to guarantee low \noutput voltage ripple, as shown in the following equation:  \nRIPPLERIPPLE\nCIVESR\nOUT∆∆≤  \nCeramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics,  \neach with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage.  \nX5R or X7R dielectrics are  recommended fo r best performance, \ndue to their  low ESR and small temperature coefficients.

C | Page 20 of 28 THERMAL CONSIDERATIO NS \nThe ADP2300/ADP2301 store the value of  the inductor current \nonly during the on time of the internal MOSFE T. Therefore,  a small  \namount of power is dissipated inside the ADP2300/ADP2301 \npackage, which reduces thermal constraints.  \nHowever, when the application is operating under maximum load with high ambient temperature and high duty cycle, the heat dissipated  within the package may cause the junction \ntemperature of the die to exceed the maximum junction temperature of 125°C.  If the junction temperature exceeds \n140°C, the regulator goes into thermal shutdown  and recovers \nwhen the junction temperature drops belo w 125°C.  \nThe junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient temperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the package due to power dissipation, as indicated  in the following \nequation:  \nT\nJ = TA + TR  \nwhere:  \nTJ is the junction tempe rature.  \nTA is the ambient temperature.  \nTR is the rise in temperature of the package due to power \ndissipation.  The rise in temperature of the package is directly proportional \nto the power dissipation in the package. The proportionality \nconstant for this relationship is the thermal resistance from the \njunction of the die to the ambient temperature, as shown in the following equation:  \nT\nR = θJA × PD  \nwhere:  \nTR is the rise in temperature of the package.  \nθJA is the thermal resistance from the junction of the die to the \nambient temperature of the package.  \nPD is the po wer dissipation in the package.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet  ADP2300/ADP2301  \n \nRev.

If higher  \nefficiency is required, choose the 700  kHz option;  however, the \nPCB footprint area of the regulator will be larger because of the \nbigger inductor and output cap acitors.  \nCATCH DIODE SELECTIO N \nSelect the catch diode . A Schottky diode is recommended for best  \nefficiency because it has a low forward voltage drop and faster switching speed. The average current of the catch diode in \nnormal operation , with  a typical Scho ttky diode forward \nvoltage, can be calculated using the following equation:  \n(max) ) (1LOAD\nD IND OUT\nAVG DIODEIV VV VI ×\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n++−=  \nwhere:   \nVOUT = 3.3 V. \nVIN = 12 V. \nILOAD (max) = 1.2 A. \nVD = 0.4 V.  \nTherefore, IDIODE(AVG)  = 0.85 A.  \nHowever,  for the worst -case condition , in which there is a  shorted  \noutput, the diode current would be increased to 2 A typical, deter -\nmined by the peak switch current limit (see Table 1). In this case,  \nselecting  a B230A , 2.0 A/30 V surface -mount Schottky diode \nwould result in more  reliable operation.  INDUCTOR SELECTION  \nSelect the inductor by using the following equation : \n()\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n++×× ×−=\nD IND OUT\nsw LOADOUT IN\nV VV V\nf IV VL\n(max)3.0 \nwhere:   \nVOUT = 3.3 V. \nVIN = 12 V. \nILOAD(max)  = 1.2 A. \nVD = 0.4 V. \nfSW = 1.4 MHz .  \nThis  results in L  = 5.15 µH. The closest standard value is  4.7 µH; \ntherefore,  ΔIRIPPLE  = 0.394 A. \nThe inductor peak current is calculated using the following equation:  \n2(max)RIPPLE\nLOAD PEAKII I∆+ =  \nwhere:   \nILOAD(max)  = 1.2 A. \nΔIRIPPLE  = 0.394 A. \nTherefore,  the calculated peak current for the inductor is 1.397  A. \nHowever, to protect the i nductor from reaching its  saturation \npoint in the current -limit condition, the inductor should be rated  \nfor at least a 2.0 A saturati on current for reliable operation.  \nOUTPUT CAPACITOR SEL ECTION  \nSelect the output capacitor  based on the output voltage ripp le \nrequirement, according to the following equation:  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+×××∆=∆\nOUTC\nOUT swRIPPLE RIPPLE ESRC fI V81 \nwhere:   \nΔIRIPPLE  = 0.394 A. \nfSW = 1.4 MHz . \nΔVRIPPLE  = 33 mV.  \nIf the ESR of the ceramic capacitor is 3  mΩ, then COUT = 1.2 µF. \nBecause  the output capacitor is one of the two external components  \nthat control the loop stability, most applications using the  ADP2301 \n(1.4 MHz  switching frequency ) require a minimum 10  µF capaci -\ntance to ensure  stability.

C | Page 23 of 28 CIRCUIT BOARD LAYOUT  RECOMMENDATIONS \nGood circuit board layout is essential to obtain the best \nperformance from the  ADP2300/ADP2301. Poor layout can \naffect the regulation  and st ability, as well as the e lectro magne tic \ninterface (EMI) and electro magnetic compatibility (EMC) \nperformance. A PCB layout  example  is shown in  Figure 50. \nRefer to the following guidelines for a good PCB layout:  \n• Place the input capacitor, inductor, catch di ode, output \ncapacitor, and bootstrap capacitor close to the IC using \nshort traces.  \n• Ensure that the high current loop traces are as short and wide  \nas possible. The high current path is  shown in  Figure 49. \n• Maximize the size of grou nd metal on the component side \nto improve  thermal dissipation.  \n• Use a ground plane with several vias connecting to the \ncomponent side ground to further reduce noise inter -\nference on sensitive circuit nodes.  • Minimize the length of the FB trace connecting the  top of the  \nfeedback resistive voltage divider  to the output . In addition,  \nkeep  these traces  away from the high current traces and the \nswitch node to avoid  noise pickup.  \nVINBST\nSW\nFBEN\nGNDADP2300/\nADP2301\n08342-046 \nFigure 49.
