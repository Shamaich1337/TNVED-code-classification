ADuM5210 /ADuM5211 /ADuM5212  \n \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADuM5210 /ADuM5211/ ADuM52121 are dual-channel digital \nisolators with isoPower®, an integrated, isolated dc-to-dc converter. \nBased on the Analog Devices, Inc., iCoupler® technology, the dc-to-\ndc converter provides regulated, isolated power that is adjustable \nbetween 3.135 V and 5.25 V . Input supply voltages can range from slightly below the required output to significantly higher. Popular voltage combinations and their associated power levels are shown \nin Table 2. \nThe ADuM5210 /ADuM5211/ ADuM5212 eliminate the need for a \nseparate, isolated dc-to-dc converter in low power, isolated designs. \nThe iCoupler chip-scale transformer technology is used for isolated \nlogic signals and for the magnetic components of the dc-to-dc \nconverter. The result is a small form factor, total isolation \nsolution.  \nisoPower uses high frequency switching elements to transfer \npower through its transformer. Take special care during printed \ncircuit board (PCB) layout to meet emissions standards. See the \nAN-0971 Application Note  for board layout recommendations.  Table 1.

D | Page 19 of 23 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe dc-to-dc converter section of the ADuM5210/ ADuM5211/ \nADuM5212 works on principles that are common to most \nmodern power supplies. It has a split controller architecture with isolated pulse-width modulation (PWM) feedback. V\nDDP power is \nsupplied to an oscillating circuit that switches current into a chip-scale air core transformer. Power transferred to the secondary side is rectified and regulate d to a value between 3.135 V and \n5.25 V , depending on the setpoint supplied by an external voltage divider (see Equation 1). The secondary (V\nISO) side \ncontroller regulates the output by creating a PWM control signal that is sent to the primary (V\nDDP) side by a dedicated iCoupler \ndata channel. The PWM modulates the oscillator circuit to control the power being sent to the secondary side. Feedback allows for significantly higher power and efficiency. \nR1R2 R1VISO) (V 25 . 1\uf02b\uf03d  (1) \nwhere: \nR1 is a resistor between V SEL and GND ISO. \nR2 is a resistor between V SEL and V ISO. \nBecause the output voltage can be adjusted continuously  there are an infinite number of operating conditions. This  data sheet addresses three discrete operating conditions in the Specifications tables. Many other combinations of input and \noutput voltage are possible; Figure 15 depicts the supported \nvoltage combinations at room temperature. Figure 15 was generated by fixing the V\nISO load and decreasing the input \nvoltage until the PWM was at 80% duty cycle. Each of the curves represents the minimum input voltage that is required \nfor operation under this criterion. For example, if the applica-\ntion requires 30 mA of output current at 5 V , the minimum input voltage at V\nDDP is 4.25 V . Figure 15 also illustrates why  \nthe V DDP = 3.3 V input and V ISO = 5 V configuration is not \nrecommended. Even at 10 mA of output current, the PWM cannot maintain less than 80% duty factor, leaving no margin  to support load or temperature variations.  \nTypically, the ADuM5210 /ADuM5211/ ADuM5212 dissipate \nabout 17% more power between room temperature and maxi-\nmum temperature; therefore, the 20% PWM margin covers \ntemperature variations. \nThe ADuM5210 /ADuM5211/ ADuM5212 implement \nundervoltage lockout (UVLO) with hysteresis on the primary \nand secondary side I/O pins as well as the V\nDDP power input. \nThis feature ensures that the converter does not go into oscillation due to noisy input power or slow power-on ramp rates. \nPCB LAYOUT \nThe ADuM5210 /ADuM5211/ ADuM5212 digital isolators with \n0.15 W isoPower integrated dc-to-dc converters require no exter-\nnal interface circuitry for the logic interfaces. Power supply bypassing with a low ESR capacitor is required, as close to the \nchip pads as possible. The isoPower inputs require several  \n passive components to bypass the power effectively as well as \nset the output voltage and bypass the core voltage regulator (see \nFigure 24 through Figure 26). \nPDIS\nVDDP\nGND P\n10µF 0.1µF+8\n9\n10\n10980-022 \nFigure 24.

V ISO Bias and Bypass Components \nThe power supply section of the ADuM5210/ ADuM5211/ \nADuM5212 uses a 125 MHz oscillator frequency to efficiently \npass power through its chip-scale transformers. Bypass capaci-\ntors are required for several operating frequencies. Noise suppression requires a low inductance, high frequency capacitor; ripple suppression and proper regulation require a large value bulk capacitor. These capacitors are most conveniently connected \nbetween Pin 9 and Pin 10 for V\nDDP and between Pin 11 and Pin 12 \nfor V ISO. To suppress noise and reduce ripple, a parallel combination \nof at least two capacitors is required. The recommended capacitor \nvalues are 0.1 μF and 10 μF for V DD1. The smaller capacitor must \nhave a low ESR; for example, use of an NPO or X5R ceramic \ncapacitor is advised. Ceramic capacitors are also recommended for \nthe 10 μF bulk capacitance. An additional 10 nF capacitor can be \nadded in parallel if further EMI reduction is required. \nNote that the total lead length between the ends of the low ESR \ncapacitor and the input power supply pin must not exceed 2 mm.  \nGNDISO\nVSELPDIS\nVDDP VISO\nGND P\nBYPASS < 2mmGND ISOADuM5210/\nADuM5211/\nADuM5212\n10980-024GND P\nVIB/VOBVIA/VOA\nVOB/VIBVOA/VIAVDD1 VDD2\nGNDP GNDISO\n \nFigure 26. Recommended PCB Layout  \nIn applications involving high common-mode transients, ensure \nthat board coupling across the isolation barrier is minimized. \nFurthermore, design the board layout such that any coupling that does occur equally affects all pins on a given component side.    \nADuM5210/ADuM5211/ADuM5212 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 20 of 23 Failure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between pins, \nexceeding the absolute maximum ratings specified in Table 20, \nthereby leading to latch-up and/or permanent damage. \nTHERMAL ANALYSIS \nThe ADuM5210 /ADuM5211/ ADuM5212 consist of four internal \ndie attached to a split lead frame with two die attach paddles. For \nthe purposes of thermal analysis, the chip is treated as a thermal \nunit, with the highest junction temperature reflected in the θ JA from \nTable 15. The value of θ JA is based on measurements taken with the \nparts mounted on a JEDEC standard, 4-layer board with fine \nwidth traces and still air. Under normal operating conditions, the ADuM5210/ ADuM5211 /ADuM5212 can operate at full load across \nthe full temperature range without derating the output current.  \nPROPAGATION DELAY PARAMETERS \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it takes a logic signal to propagate through a component (see Figure 27). \nThe propagation delay to a logic low output may differ from the \npropagation delay to a logic high. \nINPUT (V Ix)\nOUTPUT (VOx)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n10980-025 \nFigure 27. Propagation Delay Parameters \nPulse width distortion is the maximum difference between these \ntwo propagation delay values and is an indication of how \naccurately the input signal timing is preserved.  \nChannel-to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthe propagation delay differs betw een channels within a single \nADuM5210/ ADuM5211 /ADuM5212 component. \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount the \npropagation delay differs between multiple ADuM5210 / \nADuM5211/ ADuM5212  devices operating under the same \nconditions. \nEMI CONSIDERATIONS \nThe dc-to-dc converter section of the ADuM5210/ ADuM5211/ \nADuM5212 components must, of necessity, operate at a very high \nfrequency to allow efficient power transfer through the small transformers. This creates high frequency currents that can \npropagate in circuit board ground and power planes, causing \nedge and dipole radiation. Grounded enclosures are recom-mended for applications that use these devices. If grounded enclosures are not possible, follow good RF design practices  in the layout of the PCB. See the AN-0971 Application Note   \nfor the most current PCB layout recommendations for the \nADuM5210/ ADuM5211 /ADuM5212. \nDC CORRECTNESS AND MAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause \nnarrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the transformer. \nThe decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absence of logic transitions at the input for more than 1.6 μs, periodic sets of refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state are sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses of more than approximately 6.4 μs, the input side \nis assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case, \nthe isolator output is forced to a default low state by the watchdog timer circuit. This situation should occur in the ADuM5210/ \nADuM5211/ ADuM5212  only during power-up and power-down \noperations.  \nThe limitation on the ADuM5210/ ADuM5211/ ADuM5212 \nmagnetic field immunity is set by the condition in which induced \nvoltage in the transformer receiving coil is sufficiently large to either \nfalsely set or reset the decoder. The following analysis defines the conditions under which this can occur. The 3.3 V operating condition of the ADuM5210/ ADuM5211 /ADuM5212  is examined \nbecause it represents the most susceptible mode of operation. \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude of >1.5 V . \nThe decoder has a sensing threshold of about 0.5 V , thus estab-\nlishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be tolerated. \nThe voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by \nV = ( −dβ/dt)∑πr\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N \nwhere: \nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss).  N is the number of turns in the receiving coil. \nr\nn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm). \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM5210/ ADuM5211/ ADuM5212  and an imposed requirement that  \nthe induced voltage be, at most, 50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic field is calculated as shown in Figure 28.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kGauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n10980-026 \nFigure 28. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse (and is of the worst-case polarity), it reduces the received pulse \nfrom >1.0 V to 0.75 V , which is still well above the 0.5 V sensing \nthreshold of the decoder. \nData Sheet ADuM5210/ADuM5211/ADuM5212\n \nRev. D | Page 21 of 23 The preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to specific \ncurrent magnitudes at given distances from the ADuM5210/ \nADuM5211/ ADuM5212  transformers. Figure 29 expresses these \nallowable current magnitudes as a function of frequency for \nselected distances. As shown in Figure 29, the ADuM5210 / \nADuM5211/ ADuM5212  are extremely immune and can be \naffected only by extremely large currents operated at high \nfrequency very close to the component. For the 1 MHz example,  a 0.5 kA current, placed 5 mm away from the ADuM5210/ \nADuM5211/ ADuM5212 , is required to affect component \noperation. \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)1k\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n1k 10k 100M 100k 1M 10MDISTANCE = 5mmDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n10980-027 \nFigure 29. Maximum Allowable Current for Various Current-to-ADuM521x \nSpacings \nNote that, in combinations of strong magnetic field and high frequency, any loops formed by PCB traces can induce error voltages sufficiently large to trigger the thresholds of succeeding circuitry. Exercise care in the layout of such traces to avoid this possibility. POWER CONSUMPTION \nThe V DDP power supply input provides power only to the converter. \nPower for the data channels is provided through V DD1 and V DD2. \nThese power supplies can be connected to V DDP and V ISO, if desired, \nor the supplies can receive power from an independent source. The \nconverter should be treated as a standalone supply to be utilized at \nthe discretion of the designer. \nThe V DD1 or V DD2 supply current at a given channel of the \nADuM5210/ ADuM5211 /ADuM5212 isolator is a function of the \nsupply voltage, the data rate of the channel, and the output load \nof the channel. \nFor each input channel, the supply current is given by \nIDDI = I DDI (Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDI = I DDI(D)  × (2 f − f r) + I DDI (Q) f > 0.5 f r \nFor each output channel, the supply current is given by \nIDDO = I DDO( Q) f ≤ 0.5 f r \nIDDO = (IDDO (D) + (0.5 × 10−3) × CL × V DDO) × (2 f − f r) + I DDO Q ) \n f > 0.5 f r \nwhere: \nIDDI(D) , IDDO(D)  are the input and output dynamic supply currents \nper channel (mA/Mbps). I\nDDI(Q) , IDDO(Q)  are the specified input and output quiescent  \nsupply currents (mA). f is the input logic signal frequency (MHz); it is half the input \ndata rate, expressed in units of Mbps. \nf\nr is the input stage refresh rate (Mbps). \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF). \nVDDO is the output supply voltage (V). \nTo calculate the total V DD1 and V DD2 supply current, the supply \ncurrents for each input and output channel corresponding to V\nDD1 and V DD2 are calculated and totaled. Figure 18 and \nFigure 19 show per-channel supply currents as a function of data rate for an unloaded output condition. Figure 20 shows the per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for a 15 pF output condition. Figure 21 through Figure 23 show the total \nV\nDD1 and V DD2 supply current as a function of data rate for \nADuM5210/ ADuM5211 /ADuM5212 channel configurations. \nADuM5210/ADuM5211/ADuM5212 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 22 of 23 INSULATION LIFETIME \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected \nto voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of \ninsulation degradation is dependent on the characteristics of  the voltage waveform applied across the insulation. Analog \nDevices conducts an extensive set of evaluations to determine \nthe lifetime of the insulation structure within the ADuM5210/ \nADuM5211/ ADuM5212 . \nAccelerated life testing is performed using voltage levels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Acceleration factors for several operating conditions are determined, allowing calculation of the time to failure at the working voltage of interest. The values shown in Table 21 summarize the peak \nvoltages for 50 years of service life in several operating \nconditions. In many cases, the working voltage approved by agency testing is higher than the 50-year service life voltage. Operation at working voltages higher than the service life \nvoltage listed leads to premature insulation failure. \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM5210 /ADuM5211/ \nADuM5212 depends on the voltage waveform type imposed \nacross the isolation barrier. The i Coupler insulation structure \ndegrades at different rates, depending on whether the wave-\nform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 30, Figure 31, and Figure 32 illustrate these different isolation voltage waveforms. \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. A 50-year \noperating lifetime under the bipolar ac condition determines \nthe Analog Devices recommended maximum working voltage. In the case of dc or unipolar ac voltage, the stress on the insulation \nis significantly lower. This allows operation at higher working voltages while still achieving a 50-year service life. The working voltages listed in Table 21 can be applied while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime, provided the voltage conforms to either \nthe dc or unipolar ac voltage cases. Any cross-insulation voltage waveform that does not conform to Figure 31 or Figure 32 must be treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak voltage must be \nlimited to the 50-year lifetime voltage value listed in Table 21. \n \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n10980-028 \nFigure 30.
