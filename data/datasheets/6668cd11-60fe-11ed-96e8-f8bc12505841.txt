Relationship of Duty Cycle to CONTROL Pin Current.DPA-Switch  Family Functional Description\nDPA-Switch is an integrated switched mode power supply chip \nthat converts a current at the control input to a duty cycle at the open drain output of a high-voltage power MOSFET.  During \nnormal operation the duty cycle of the power MOSFET \ndecreases linearly with increasing CONTROL pin current as shown in Figure 4. A patented high-voltage CMOS technology allows both the high-voltage power MOSFET and all the low \nvoltage control circuitry to be cost effectively integrated onto a \nsingle monolithic chip.\nIn addition to the standard TOPSwitch features, such as the \nhigh-voltage start-up, the cycle-by-cycle current limiting, loop \ncompensation circuitry, auto-restart and thermal shutdown,  \nDPA-Switch also offers many advanced features that reduce system cost and increase power supply performance and design flexibility. Following is a summary of the advanced \nfeatures:\n1. A fully integrated 5 ms soft-start limits peak currents and \nvoltages during start-up and reduces or eliminates output overshoot in most applications.\n2. A 75% maximum duty cycle (DCMAX) together with the line \nfeed-forward with DCMAX reduction feature makes  \nDPA-Switch well suited for both flyback and forward  topologies.\n3. High switching frequency (400 kHz/300 kHz, pin selectable) allows the use of smaller size transformers and offers high bandwidth for power supply control loop.\n4. Cycle skipping operation at light load minimizes standby power consumption (typically <10 mA input current).\n5. Line undervoltage ensures glitch free operations at both power-up and power-down and is tightly toleranced over process and temperature to meet system level requirements \ncommon in DC to DC converters (e.g. ETSI).\n6. Line overvoltage protects DPA-Switch against excessive \ninput voltage and line surge.\n7. External current limit adjustment allows the setting of the current limit externally to a lower level near the operating peak current and, if desired, further adjusts the level gradu-\nally as line voltage rises. This makes possible an ideal \nimplementation of overload power limiting.\n8. Synchronization function allows the synchronization of  DPA-Switch operation to an external lower frequency. \n9. Remote ON/OFF feature permits DPA-Switch based power supplies to be easily switched on/off using logic signals. Maximum input current consumption is 2 mA in remote OFF.\n10. Hysteretic over-temperature shutdown provides automatic recovery from thermal fault.\n11. Tight absolute tolerances and small temperature variations on switching frequency, current limit, and undervoltage lock out threshold (UV).\nThree pins, LINE-SENSE (L), EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (X) and FREQUENCY (F), are used to implement all the pin -controllable features. A resistor from the LINE-SENSE pin to DC \ninput bus implements line UV, line OV and line feed-forward with \nDC\nMAX reduction. A resistor from the EXTERNAL CURRENT \nLIMIT pin to the SOURCE pin sets current limit externally. In addition, remote ON/OFF may be implemented through either the LINE-SENSE pin or the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin depending on the polarity of the logic signal available as well as other system specific considerations. Shorting both the LINE-SENSE and the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pins to the \nSOURCE pin disables line OV, line UV, line feed-forward with \nDC\nMAX reduction, external current limit, remote ON/OFF and \nsynchronization. The FREQUENCY pin sets the switching frequency to 400 kHz if connected to the SOURCE pin, or  \n300 kHz if connected to the CONTROL pin.  This pin should not \nbe left open. Please refer to “Using Feature Pins” section for detailed information regarding the proper use of those pins. \nCONTROL (C) Pin Operation\nThe CONTROL pin is a low impedance node that is capable of \nreceiving a combined supply and feedback current.  During normal operation, a shunt regulator is used to separate the feedback signal from the supply current.  CONTROL pin voltage V\nC is the supply voltage for the control circuitry including the \nMOSFET gate driver.  An external bypass capacitor closely connected between the CONTROL and SOURCE pins is \nrequired to supply the instantaneous gate drive current.  The \ntotal amount of capacitance connected to this pin also sets the auto-restart timing as well as control loop compensation.\nWhen the DC input voltage is applied to the DRAIN pin during \nstart-up, the MOSFET is initially off, and the CONTROL pin capacitor is charged through the switched high-voltage current source connected internally between the DRAIN and  \nCONTROL pins.  When the CONTROL pin voltage V\nC reaches \napproximately 5.8 V, the control circuitry is activated and the soft-start begins. The soft-start circuit gradually increases the \nduty cycle of the MOSFET from zero to the maximum value   \nover approximately 5 ms. The high-voltage current source is turned off at the end of the soft-start.  If no external feedback/supply current is fed into the CONTROL pin by the end of the \nsoft-start, the CONTROL pin will start discharging in response \nto the supply current drawn by the control circuitry and the gate current of the switching MOSFET driver.  If the power supply is designed properly, and no fault condition such as open loop or PI-2761-112102Duty Cycle (%)\nIC (mA)IL = 115 µAIL < IL(DC) IC (SKIP) Slope = PWM GainICD1 IBAuto-restart\n75\n442\nRev. U 06/155\nDPA422-426\nwww.power.com overloaded output exists, the feedback loop will close, providing \nexternal CONTROL pin current, before the CONTROL pin voltage has had a chance to discharge to the lower threshold \nvoltage of approximately 4.8 V (internal supply undervoltage \nlockout threshold).  When the externally fed current charges the CONTROL pin to the shunt regulator voltage of 5.8 V, current in excess of the consumption of the chip is shunted to SOURCE \nthrough resistor R\nE as shown in Figure 2.  This current flowing \nthrough RE controls the duty cycle of the power MOSFET to \nprovide closed loop regulation.  The shunt regulator has a finite \nlow output impedance ZC that sets the gain of the error amplifier \nwhen used in a primary feedback configuration.  The dynamic impedance Z\nC of the CONTROL pin together with the external \nCONTROL pin capacitance sets the dominant pole for the control loop.\nWhen a fault condition such as an open loop or overloaded  \noutput prevents the flow of an external current into the CONTROL pin, the capacitor on the CONTROL pin discharges towards 4.8 \nV.  At 4.8 V auto-restart is activated which turns the output \nMOSFET off and puts the control circuitry in a low current standby mode.  The high-voltage current source turns on and charges the external capacitance again.  A hysteretic internal supply undervoltage comparator keeps V\nC within a window of \ntypically 4.8 V to 5.8 V by turning the high-voltage current source on and off as shown in Figure 5.  The auto-restart circuit \nhas a divide-by-8 counter that prevents the output MOSFET \nfrom turning on again until eight discharge/charge cycles have elapsed.  This is accomplished by enabling the output MOSFET only when the divide-by-8 counter reaches full count (S7).  The \ncounter effectively limits DPA-Switch power dissipation as well \nas the maximum power delivered to the power supply output by reducing the auto-restart duty cycle to typically 4%.  Auto-restart mode continues until output voltage regulation is again achieved through closure of the feedback loop.Oscillator and Switching FrequencyThe internal oscillator linearly charges and discharges an internal capacitance between two voltage levels to create a \nsawtooth waveform for the pulse width modulator.  The \noscillator sets both the pulse width modulator latch and the current limit latch at the beginning of each cycle.\nThe nominal switching frequency of 400 kHz was chosen to \nminimize the transformer size and to allow faster power supply \nloop response.  The FREQUENCY pin, when shorted to the CONTROL pin, lowers the switching frequency to 300 kHz, which may be preferable in some applications such as those \nemploying secondary synchronous rectification. Otherwise, the \nFREQUENCY pin should be connected to the SOURCE pin for the default 400 kHz. \nPulse Width Modulator and Maximum Duty Cycle\nThe pulse width modulator implements voltage mode control by \ndriving the output MOSFET with a duty cycle inversely \nproportional to the current into the CONTROL pin that is in excess of the internal supply current of the chip (see Figure 4). The excess current is the feedback error signal that appears \nacross R\nE (see Figure 2). This signal is filtered by an RC network \nwith a typical corner frequency of 30 kHz to reduce the effect of \nswitching noise in the chip supply current generated by the \nMOSFET gate driver. The filtered error signal is compared with \nthe internal oscillator sawtooth waveform to generate the duty cycle waveform. As the control current increases, the duty cycle decreases. A clock signal from the oscillator sets a latch that \nturns on the output MOSFET. The pulse width modulator resets \nthe latch, turning off the output MOSFET.  Note that a minimum current must be driven into the CONTROL pin before the duty cycle begins to change.\nPI-3867-050602S1 S2 S6 S7 S1 S2 S6 S7 S0 S1 S7S0 S05.8 V\n4.8 VS70 V\n0 V\n0 VVLINE\nVC\nVDRAIN\nVOUT\nNote: S0 through S7 are the output states of the auto-restart counter  2 1 2 3 40 V\n~~~~ ~~ ~~\nS6 S7~~ ~~ ~~VUV\n~~\n~~ ~~ ~~S2~~\nFigure 5.   T ypical Waveforms for (1) Power Up, (2) Normal Operation, (3) Auto-restart and (4) Power Down.\nRev. U 06/156\nDPA422-426\nwww.power.com The maximum duty cycle, DCMAX is set at a default maximum \nvalue of 75% (typical). However, by connecting the LINE-SENSE \nto the DC input bus through a resistor with appropriate value, \nthe maximum duty cycle can be made to decrease from 75% to \n33% (typical) as shown in Figure 7 when input line voltage increases (see Line Feed-Forward with DC\nMAX Reduction).\nMinimum Duty Cycle and Cycle SkippingTo maintain power supply output regulation, the pulse width \nmodulator reduces duty cycle as the load at the power supply \noutput decreases. This reduction in duty cycle is proportional to the current flowing into the CONTROL pin. As the CONTROL pin current increases, the duty cycle reduces linearly towards a \nminimum value specified as minimum duty cycle, DC\nMIN. After \nreaching DCMIN, if CONTROL pin current is increased further by \napproximately 2 mA, the pulse width modulator will force the \nduty cycle from DCMIN to zero in a discrete step (refer to Figure \n4). This feature allows a power supply to operate in a cycle skipping mode when the load consumes less power than the \nDPA-Switch delivers at minimum duty cycle, DC\nMIN. No \nadditional control is needed for the transition between normal \noperation and cycle skipping. As the load increases or \ndecreases, the power supply automatically switches between \nnormal and cycle skipping mode as necessary.\nCycle skipping may be avoided, if so desired, by connecting a \nminimum load at the power supply output such that the duty \ncycle remains at a level higher than DCMIN at all times.\nError AmplifierThe shunt regulator can also perform the function of an error \namplifier in primary side feedback applications. The shunt \nregulator voltage is accurately derived from a temperature-compensated bandgap reference. The gain of the error amplifier is set by the CONTROL pin dynamic impedance. The CONTROL \npin clamps external circuit signals to the V\nC voltage level. The \nCONTROL pin current in excess of the supply current is \nseparated by the shunt regulator and flows through RE as a \nvoltage error signal.\nOn-chip Current Limit with External Programmability\nThe cycle-by-cycle peak drain current limit circuit uses the \noutput MOSFET ON-resistance as a sense resistor. A current limit comparator compares the output MOSFET on-state drain to source voltage, V\nDS(ON) with a threshold voltage. At the current \nlimit, VDS(ON) exceeds the threshold voltage and the MOSFET is \nturned off until the start of the next clock cycle. The current limit comparator threshold voltage is temperature compensated to \nminimize the variation of the current limit due to temperature \nrelated changes in R\nDS(ON) of the output MOSFET. The default \ncurrent limit of DPA-Switch is preset internally. However, with a resistor connected between EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin \nand SOURCE pin, the current limit can be programmed \nexternally to a lower level between 25% and 100% of the default current limit. Please refer to the graphs in the Typical Performance Characteristics section for the selection of the \nresistor value. By setting current limit low, a larger DPA-Switch \nthan necessary for the power required can be used to take advantage of the lower R\nDS(ON) for higher efficiency/smaller heat \nsinking requirements. With a second resistor connected between the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin and the DC input bus, the current limit is reduced with increasing line voltage, allowing a true power limiting operation against line variation to be implemented in a flyback configuration. \nThe leading edge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit \ncomparator for a short time after the output MOSFET is turned on. The leading edge blanking time has been set so that, if a power supply is designed properly, current spikes caused by \nprimary-side capacitance and secondary-side rectifier reverse \nrecovery time should not cause premature termination of the switching pulse.\nThe current limit after the leading edge blanking time is as \nshown in Figure 31. To avoid triggering the current limit in \nnormal operation, the drain current waveform should stay within the envelope shown.\nLine Undervoltage Detection (UV)\nAt power up, UV keeps DPA-Switch off until the input line \nvoltage reaches the under voltage upper threshold. At power \ndown, UV holds DPA-Switch on until the input voltage falls below the under voltage lower threshold. A single resistor connected from the LINE-SENSE pin to the DC input bus sets \nUV upper and lower thresholds. To avoid false triggering by \nnoise, a hysteresis is implemented which sets the UV lower threshold typically at 94% of the UV upper threshold. If the UV lower threshold is reached during operation without the power \nsupply losing regulation and the condition stays longer than  \n10 µs (typical), the device will turn off and stay off until the UV \nupper threshold has been reached again. Then, a soft-start will be initiated the next time CONTROL pin voltage reaches 5.8.V. If the power supply loses regulation before reaching the UV lower \nthreshold, the device will enter auto-restart. At the end of each \nauto-restart cycle (S7), the UV comparator is enabled. If the UV upper threshold is not exceeded, the MOSFET will be disabled during the next cycle (see Figure 5). The UV feature can be \ndisabled independent of OV feature.\nLine Overvoltage Shutdown (OV)\nThe same resistor used for UV also sets an overvoltage threshold which, once exceeded, will force the DPA-Switch output into the off-state within one switching cycle. The ratio of \nOV and UV thresholds is preset at 2.7 as can be seen in Figure 7. \nWhen the MOSFET is off, the input voltage surge capability is increased to the voltage rating of the MOSFET (220 V), due to the absence of the reflected voltage and leakage spikes on the \ndrain. A small amount of hysteresis is provided on the OV \nthreshold to prevent noise triggering. The OV feature can be \ndisabled independent of the UV feature as shown in Figure 13.\nLine Feed-Forward with DCMAX Reduction\nThe same resistor used for UV and OV also implements line \nvoltage feed-forward that minimizes output line ripple and \nreduces power supply output sensitivity to line transients. This \nfeed-forward operation is illustrated in Figure 4 by the different values of I\nL. Note that for the same CONTROL pin current, \nhigher line voltage results in smaller operating duty cycle. As an added feature, the maximum duty cycle DC\nMAX is also reduced \nfrom 75% (typical) at a voltage slightly higher than the UV threshold to 33% (typical) at the OV threshold (see Figures 4, 7).  \nLimiting DC\nMAX at higher line voltages helps prevent transformer \nRev. U 06/157\nDPA422-426\nwww.power.com Figure 6.  Synchronization T iming Diagram.saturation due to large load transients in forward converter \napplications. DCMAX of 33% at the OV threshold was chosen to \nensure that the power capability of the DPA-Switch is not restricted by this feature under normal operation.\nRemote ON/OFF\nRemote ON/OFF control describes operation where the IC is turned on or off for long periods as opposed to the cycle-by- cycle on/off control, which is described in the Synchronization  \nsection below.\nDPA-Switch can be turned on or off by controlling the current \ninto the LINE-SENSE pin or out from the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin (see Figure 7). This allows easy implementation of \nremote ON/OFF control of DPA-Switch in several different ways. \nA transistor or an optocoupler output connected between the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin and the SOURCE pin implements this function with “active-on” (Figures 17, 19 and 21) while a \ntransistor or an optocoupler output connected between the \nLINE-SENSE pin and the CONTROL pin implements the function with “active-off” (Figures 18, 20 and 22).\nWhen a signal is received at the LINE-SENSE pin or the \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin to disable the output through \nany of the pin functions such as OV, UV and remote ON/OFF, DPA-Switch always completes its current switching cycle before the output is forced off. The internal oscillator is stopped at the \nend of the current cycle and stays there as long as the disable \nsignal exists. When the signal at the above pins changes state from disable to enable, the internal oscillator starts the next switching cycle.\nThe remote ON/OFF feature can be used as a standby or power \nswitch to turn off the DPA-Switch and keep it in a very low power consumption state for indefinitely long periods. If the DPA-Switch is held in remote-off state for longer than 10 µ s \n(typical), the CONTROL pin goes into the hysteretic mode of operation. In this mode, the CONTROL pin goes through alternate charge and discharge cycles between 4.8 V and 5.8 V \n(see CONTROL Pin Operation section above) and the IC runs \nentirely off the high-voltage DC input, but with very low power consumption (30 mW typical at 48 V with LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pins open). When the DPA-Switch \nis remotely turned on after entering this mode, it will initiate a \nnormal start-up sequence with soft-start the next time the CONTROL pin reaches 5.8 V.  In the worst case, the delay from remote on to start-up can be equal to the full discharge/charge cycle time of the CONTROL pin, which is approximately 36 ms \nfor a 22 µF CONTROL pin capacitor. This reduced-consumption \nremote-off mode can eliminate expensive and unreliable in-line \nmechanical switches. It also allows for microprocessor-controlled turn-on and turn-off sequences that may be required \nin certain applications.\nSynchronization\nIn addition to sensing incoming current for OV, UV and remote ON/OFF, the LINE-SENSE pin also monitors its pin voltage through a 1 V threshold comparator. A pin voltage below 1 V \nturns on DPA-Switch. When the voltage at LINE-SENSE pin \nrises beyond 1 V to disable the output, DPA-Switch completes its current switching cycle before the output is forced off (similar to remote ON/OFF operation). The internal oscillator is stopped \nat the end of the current cycle awaiting the LINE-SENSE pin \nvoltage to go low to start the next cycle. This allows the use of the 1 V threshold to synchronize DPA-Switch to an external signal with a frequency lower than its internal switching frequency. A transistor or an optocoupler output connected \nbetween the LINE-SENSE pin and the SOURCE pin implements \nthis function (see Figure 24).

In addition, the off-time \nmust be kept below 7.7 µ s, which is a limitation set by the \nlowest synchronization frequency of 128 kHz allowed by the chip. The effective DC\nMAX for synchronization operation can be \ncalculated as 0.75 × fSYNC/fOSC. An off-time longer than  \n7.7 µ s may force the CONTROL pin to go into the hysteretic \nmode and initiate a soft-start cycle at next turn-on.\nSoft-Start\nTwo on-chip soft-start functions are activated at start-up with a duration of 5 ms (typical). Maximum duty cycle starts from 0% and linearly increases to the default maximum of 75% at the \nend of the 5 ms duration and the current limit starts from about \n85% and linearly increases to 100% at the end of the 5 ms duration. In addition to start-up, soft-start is also activated at each restart attempt during auto-restart and when restarting after being in hysteretic regulation of CONTROL pin voltage (V\nC), \ndue to remote off or thermal shutdown conditions. This effectively minimizes current and voltage stresses on the output \nMOSFET, the clamp circuit and the output rectifier during start-\nup. This feature also helps minimize output overshoot and prevents saturation of the transformer during start-up.\nShutdown/Auto-Restart\nTo minimize DPA-Switch power dissipation under fault \nconditions, the shutdown/auto-restart circuit turns the power supply on and off at an auto-restart duty cycle of typically 4% if an out of regulation condition persists. Loss of regulation interrupts the external current into the CONTROL pin. V\nC \nregulation changes from shunt mode to the hysteretic auto-restart mode as described in CONTROL pin operation section. \nWhen the fault condition is removed, the power supply output \nbecomes regulated, V\nC regulation returns to shunt mode, and \nnormal operation of the power supply resumes.\nHysteretic Over-Temperature Protection\nOver temperature protection is provided by a precision analog \ncircuit that turns the output MOSFET off when the junction temperature exceeds the thermal shutdown temperature  (137 ° C typical). When the junction temperature cools to below \nthe hysteretic temperature (110 ° C typical), normal operation \nresumes providing automatic recovery. V\nC is regulated in \nhysteretic mode and a 4.8 V to 5.8 V (typical) sawtooth waveform is present on the CONTROL pin while in thermal \nshutdown.\nBandgap Reference\nAll critical DPA-Switch internal voltages are derived from a temperature-compensated bandgap reference. This reference \nis also used to generate a temperature-compensated current \nreference that is trimmed to accurately set the switching frequency, current limit, and the line OV/UV thresholds.  \nDPA-Switch has improved circuitry to maintain all of the above critical parameters within very tight absolute and temperature \ntolerances.\nHigh-Voltage Bias Current Source\nThis current source biases DPA-Switch from the DRAIN pin and charges the CONTROL pin external capacitance during start-up \nor hysteretic operation. Hysteretic operation occurs during \nauto-restart, remote off and over-temperature shutdown. In this mode of operation, the current source is switched on and off with an effective duty cycle of approximately 20%. This duty cycle is determined by the ratio of CONTROL pin charge (I\nC(CH)) \nand discharge currents (ICD1 and ICD2). This current source is \nturned off during normal operation when the output MOSFET is switching. The effect of the current source switching may be \nseen on the DRAIN voltage waveform as small disturbances, \nwhich is normal. \nUsing Feature Pins\nFREQUENCY (F) Pin OperationThe FREQUENCY pin is a digital input pin. Shorting the FREQUENCY pin to SOURCE pin selects the nominal switching \nfrequency of 400 kHz (Figure 9) which is suited for most \napplications. For other applications that may benefit from lower switching frequency, a 300 kHz switching frequency can be selected by shorting the FREQUENCY pin to the CONTROL pin \n(Figure 10). This pin should not be left open. \nLine-Sense and External Current Limit Pin Table*\nFigure Number ➧ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\nThree Terminal Operation ✓\nUndervoltage ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓\nOvervoltage ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓\nLine Feed-Forward (DCMAX) ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓\nOverload Power Limiting ✓\nExternal Current Limit ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓\nRemote ON/OFF ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓\nSynchronization ✓\n*This table is only a partial list of many LINE-SENSE and EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT Pin Configurations that are possible.\nRev. U 06/159\nDPA422-426\nwww.power.com LINE-SENSE (L) Pin Operation \nWhen  current is fed into the LINE-SENSE pin, it works as a \nvoltage source of approximately 2.6 V up to a maximum current \nof +240 µ A (typical).  At +240 µ A, this pin turns into a constant \ncurrent sink. Refer to Figure 8. In addition, a comparator with a \nthreshold of 1 V is connected at the pin and is used to detect when the pin is shorted to the SOURCE pin.\nThere are a total of five functions available through the use of \nthe LINE-SENSE pin: OV, UV, line feed-forward with DC\nMAX \nreduction, remote ON/OFF and synchronization. Shorting the LINE-SENSE pin to the SOURCE pin disables all five functions. \nThe LINE-SENSE pin is typically used for line sensing by \nconnecting a resistor from this pin to the positive input DC voltage bus to implement OV, UV and line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction over line voltage. In this mode, the value of the \nresistor determines the line OV/UV thresholds, and the DCMAX is \nreduced linearly with input DC high-voltage starting from just above the UV threshold. This pin can also be used as the input \npin for remote ON/OFF and synchronization. An external \ntransistor placed between the LINE-SENSE pin and the CONTROL pin realizes remote ON/OFF via UV or OV threshold. Synchronization is available by connecting an open drain \nexternal MOSFET between the LINE-SENSE pin and the \nSOURCE pin to generate synchronization pulse. Each time the MOSFET turns on, the falling edge of the LINE-SENSE pin voltage initiates a new switching cycle. The lowest synchronization frequency guaranteed by DPA-Switch is 128 kHz. Refer to Table \n2 for possible combinations of the functions with example \ncircuits shown in Figure 11 through Figure 24. A description of specific functions in terms of the LINE-SENSE pin I/V characteristic is shown in Figure 7 (right hand side). The \nhorizontal axis represents LINE-SENSE pin current with positive \npolarity indicating currents flowing into the pin. The meaning of the vertical axes varies with functions. For those that control the on/off states of the output such as UV, OV and remote ON/OFF, \nthe vertical axis represents the enable/disable states of the \noutput. UV triggers at I\nUV (+50 µ A typical with 4 µ A hysteresis) \nand OV triggers at IOV (+135 µ A typical with 4 µ A hysteresis). \nBetween the UV and OV thresholds, the output is enabled. For line feed-forward with DC\nMAX reduction, the vertical axis \nrepresents the magnitude of the DCMAX Line feed-forward with \nDCMAX reduction lowers maximum duty cycle from 75% at IL(DC) \n(+55 µ A typical) to 33% at IOV (+135 µ A).\nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT (X) Pin OperationWhen current is drawn out of the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin, \nit works as a voltage source of approximately 1.3 V up to a \nmaximum current of -230 µ A (typical). At -230 µ A, it turns into a \nconstant current source (refer to Figure 8).\nThere are two functions available through the use of the \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin: external current limit and remote ON/OFF. Shorting the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin and SOURCE pin disables both functions. In high efficiency applications, this pin can be used to reduce the current limit \nexternally to a value close to the operating peak current, by \nconnecting the pin to the SOURCE pin through a resistor. The pin can also be used as a remote ON/OFF control input.  Table 2 shows several different ways of using this pin. See \nFigure 7 for a description of the functions where the horizontal \naxis (left hand side) represents the EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pin current. The meaning of the vertical axes varies with function. For those that control the on/off states of the output such as remote ON/OFF, the vertical axis represents the enable/\ndisable states of the output. For external current limit, the \nvertical axis represents the magnitude of the I\nLIMIT.

This design \ndelivers 30 W at 5 V, from a 36 VDC to 75 VDC input with a \nnominal efficiency at 48 VDC of 90% using the DPA425R.\nBy taking advantage of many of the built-in features of the  \nDPA-Switch, the design is greatly simplified compared to a \ndiscrete implementation. Resistor R1 programs the input under-voltage and overvoltage thresholds to typically 33 V and 86 V respectively. This resistor also linearly reduces the maximum duty from the internal maximum of 75% at 36 V to 42% at  \n72 V to prevent core saturation during load transients at high \ninput voltages. The DPA-Switch internal thresholds are toleranced and characterized so the designer can guarantee the converter will begin operation at 36 V, necessary to meet \nETSI standards, without the cost of an external reference IC.\nThe current limit is externally set by resistor R3 to just above the \ndrain current level needed for maximum load regulation to limit the maximum overload power of the converter. The externally \nprogrammable current limit feature also allows a larger  \nDPA-Switch family member to be selected. Using the X pin, the \ncurrent limit can be adjusted to the same level. A large device reduces conduction losses and improves efficiency without \nrequiring any other circuit changes. This has been used here to \nreplace the DPA424R with a DPA425R.Application Examples\nThe selectable 300/400 kHz switching frequency is set to 300 kHz by connecting the FREQUENCY (F) pin to CONTROL (C).\nDRAIN voltage clamping is provided by VR1, which keeps the \npeak DRAIN voltage within acceptable limits. Transformer core reset is provided by the gate capacitance of Q1 with R17 in series. Optional reset capacitance C9 with R5 can be added if \nnecessary to supplement the gate capacitance of Q1.\nThe output of the transformer is rectified using MOSFETs to \nprovide synchronous rectification. The UV/OV function, together with the turns ratio of the transformer, defines the maximum \nMOSFET gate voltage, allowing the very simple gate drive \narrangement, without the need for drive windings or a drive IC. During primary on-time, capacitor C17 couples charge through resistor R15 to drive the gate of the forward MOSFET, Q2. \nCapacitor C17 provides a DC isolated drive for Q2, preventing \ngate overstress on Q1 during power down. The time constant formed by R16 and C17 is selected to be much longer than one switching cycle.   Diode D4 resets the voltage on capacitor C17 before the next switching cycle.  During the primary off-time, the \ndiode D2 provides a conduction path for the energy in inductor \nL2 while Q1 is still off. The transformer reset voltage on the secondary winding directly drives a positive voltage on the gate of catch MOSFET, Q1. MOSFET Q1 provides a low loss \nconduction path for a substantial portion of the primary off-time. \nAn isolated auxiliary winding on L2, rectified and filtered by D1 and C4, provides the bias supply for the optocoupler transistor. \nRev.

A Cost Effective 6.6 W, 3.3 V Flyback DC-DC Converter.\nOutput regulation is achieved by using secondary side voltage \nreference, U3. The resistor divider formed by R10 and R11, together with the reference voltage, determines the output \nvoltage. Diode D3 and C13 form a soft-finish network that, \ntogether with the internal duty cycle and current limit soft-start \nof the DPA -S witch, prevent output overshoot at start-up. \nResistor R7 ensures that the soft-finish capacitor is discharged quickly when the output falls out of regulation. Control loop response is shaped by R6, C16, R12, C14, R9, R4 and C5, \nproviding a wide bandwidth and good phase margin at gain \ncrossover. Since the PWM control in DPA-Switch is voltage mode, no slope compensation is required for duty cycles above 50%.\nCost Effective 6.6 W Flyback Converter\nThe DPA-Switch flyback power supply provides a cost effective \nsolution for high density PoE and VoIP DC-DC applications.\n  \nFigure 26 shows a typical implementation of a single output \nflyback converter using the DPA423G. For applications that require input to output isolation, this simple, low component count design delivers 6.6 W at 3.3 V from a 36 VDC to 57 VDC \ninput with a nominal efficiency at 48 VDC of 80%.\nResistor R2 programs the input undervoltage and overvoltage \nthresholds to 33 V and 86 V respectively.  Resistors R1 and R3 program the internal device current limit.  The addition of line \nsense resistor R1 reduces the current limit with increasing input \nvoltage, preventing excessive overload output current.  In this design the overload output current varies less than ±2.5% across the entire input voltage range. Controlling the current \nlimit also reduces secondary component stress and leakage \ninductance spikes, allowing the use of a lower V\nRRM (30 V rather \nthan 40 V) Schottky output diode, D2.The primary side Zener clamp VR1 ensures the peak drain voltage is kept below the 220 V BV\nDSS rating of U1 under input \nsurge and overvoltage events.  During normal operation, VR1 does not conduct and C2 is sufficient to limit the peak drain \nvoltage.\nThe primary bias winding provides CONTROL pin current after \nstart-up.  Diode D3 rectifies the bias winding, while components \nR5 and C8 reduce high frequency switching noise and prevent \npeak charging of the bias voltage. Capacitor C3 provides local decoupling of U1 and should be physically close to the CONTROL and SOURCE pins.  Energy storage for start-up and auto-restart timing is provided by C4.\nThe secondary is rectified by D2 and the Low ESR tantalum \noutput capacitors, C5-C7, minimizing switching ripple and maximizing efficiency. A small footprint secondary output choke \nL1 and ceramic output capacitor C9 are adequate to reduce \nhigh frequency noise and ripple to below 35 mV peak-peak under full load conditions.\nThe output voltage is sensed by the voltage divider formed by \nresistors R8 and R9 and is fed to the low voltage 1.24 V \nreference U3.  Feedback compensation is provided by R6, R7 and C11 together with C4 and R4.  Capacitor C10 provides a soft-finish characteristic, preventing output overshoot during \nstart-up.\nLow Cost PoE VoIP Phone Converter\nThe basic circuitry to support IEEE standard 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) is straightforward.

Figure 27 shows a typical PD solution.\nThe PoE specification requires the PD to provide three \nfundamental functions: discovery, classification, and pass-switch connection.\nWhen input voltage is applied to the PD, it must present the \ncorrect discovery signature impedance in the voltage range of 2.5 VDC to 10 VDC. This impedance is provided by R51 in Figure 27.\nThe second “classification” phase occurs at input voltages  \n15 VDC to 20 VDC. The PD must draw a specified current to \nidentify the device class (Class 0 specifies 0.5 mA to 4 mA). \nThis is again accomplished by resistor R51.\nIn the third phase, the bipolar pass-switch (Q51 in Figure 27) \nconnects the input voltage to the power supply at voltages above approximately 30 VDC (28 V+VR52). Zener diode VR51 \nconducts, driving the current through resistor R52 to the base \nof Q51. Resistor R53 prevents turn-on under other conditions. Once the Power supply has started, components D51, D52, C51 and R54 enhance the base-current drive by coupling \npower from the power supply bias winding.Once the three start up phases have been successfully \ncompleted, the DPA-Switch is allowed to function as a forward converter (described in Figure 25 and accompanying text). \nKey Application Considerations\nDPA-Switch  Design Considerations\nPower TableThis section provides a description of the assumptions used to \ngenerate the power tables (Tables 1 and 3 through 6) and \nexplains how to use the information provided by them.\nAll Power tables: Tables 1 and 3 through 6\n• Maximum output power is limited by the device internal \ncurrent limit. This is the peak output power which could become the continuous output power, provided adequate \nheat sinking is used.\n• Data assumes adequate heat sinking to keep the junction \ntemperature at or below 100 °C and worst case RDS(ON) at  \nTJ = 100 °C.\n• The use of P and G packages are recommended for device dissipation equal to or less than 1.5 W only due to package thermal limitation. For device dissipation above 1.5 W, use  \nR package.\nRev. U 06/1517\nDPA422-426\nwww.power.com Forward power tables: Tables 1 (upper half), 3 and 4\n• Output power figures are based on forward topology using \nSchottky diode rectification. Up to 5% higher output power is possible using synchronous rectification.\n• Dissipation data assumes a diode loss representing 6% of the total output power and combined loss in magnetic compo-nents representing 6% of the total output power. DPA-Switch \nlosses are based on a ratio between conduction and switch-\ning losses of approximately 3:1. These assumptions are typical for a single 5 V output forward converter design using Schottky rectification and adequately designed magnetic \ncomponents.\nFlyback power tables: Tables 1 (lower half), 5 and 6\n• Output power and dissipation figures are based on a 5 V \noutput using Schottky diode rectification with an efficiency of 85%. Values are generated by calculation based on  \nI\n2 × RDS(ON) losses and characterization of switching losses,  \ncorrelated to bench measurement of each DPA-Switch device.\n• Device dissipations above 1.5 W are possible using the  \nR package. However the forward converter topology is recommended for such higher power designs. \n The power tables provide two types of information. The first is the expected device dissipation for a given output power. The second is the maximum power output. Each table specifies the \ninput voltage range and assumes a single 5 V output using \nSchottky diode rectification. \nFor example, referring to Table 1, for 36 VDC to 75 VDC input \nrange, DPA424 would typically dissipate 1 W in a 23 W forward \nconverter and has a maximum power capacity of 35 W. In the \nsame converter, DPA425 would dissipate 0.5 W. Selecting DPA425 with associated reduced dissipation would increase overall converter efficiency by approximately 2%. \nIssues Affecting Dissipation: \n1. Using synchronous rectification will tend to reduce device \ndissipation. \n2. Designs with lower output voltages and higher currents will tend to increase the device dissipation listed in the power table. \n3. Reduced input voltage decreases the available output power for the same device dissipation. Tables 3 to 6  are the power tables for 16 VDC and 24 VDC input voltages. Input voltages \nbelow 16 V are possible, but since the internal start-up \ncurrent source is not specified at voltages below 16 V, an external chip supply current should be fed into the  CONTROL pin approximately equal to but less than I\nCD1.\nDPA-Switch SelectionUse Tables 1 and 3 through 6 to select the DPA-Switch based \non device dissipation. Selecting the optimum DPA-Switch \ndepends upon required maximum output power, efficiency, heat sinking constraints and cost goals. With the option to externally reduce current limit, a larger DPA-Switch may be \nused for lower power applications where higher efficiency is \nneeded or minimal heat sinking is available.  Generally, selecting the next larger device, than is required for power delivery will give the highest efficiency.

Higher switching losses may prevent DPA425 from delivering more power than a \nsmaller device.\nRev. U 06/1518\nDPA422-426\nwww.power.com give little or no improvement in efficiency due to the \nimprovement in conduction losses being negated by larger device switching losses.  Figure 50 provides information on \nswitching losses. This together with conduction loss \ncalculations give an estimate of device dissipation.\nPrimary Clamp\nA primary clamp network is recommended to keep the peak \nDRAIN voltage due to primary leakage inductance to below the \nBV\nDSS specification. A Zener diode combined with a small value \ncapacitor connected across the primary winding is a low cost and low part count implementation.\nOutput Rectification\nRectification of the secondary is typically performed using Schottky diodes or synchronous rectification.  Schottky diodes are selected for peak inverse voltage, output current, forward \ndrop and thermal conditions.  Synchronous rectification \nrequires the additional complication of providing gate drive.  The specified line undervoltage and line overvoltage thresholds of DPA-Switch simplifies deriving gate drive directly from the transformer secondary winding for many applications.  The \nturns ratio of the transformer together with the under/over-\nvoltage thresholds defines the minimum and maximum gate voltages, removing the need for Zeners to clamp the gate voltage.\nSoft-Start\nGenerally a power supply experiences maximum stress at start-up before the feedback loop achieves regulation.  For a period of 5 ms the on-chip soft-start linearly increases the duty cycle from zero to the default DC\nMAX at turn-on. In addition, the \nprimary current limit increases from 85% to 100% over the same period.  This causes the output voltage to rise in an \norderly manner allowing time for the feedback loop to take \ncontrol of the duty cycle.  This integrated soft-start reduces the stress on the DPA-Switch MOSFET, clamp circuit and output diode(s), and helps prevent transformer saturation during start-\nup.  Also, soft-start limits the amount of output voltage \novershoot, and in many applications eliminates the need for a soft-finish capacitor. If necessary, to remove output overshoot, a soft-finish capacitor may be added to the secondary reference.\nSwitching Frequency\nThe FREQUENCY pin of DPA-Switch offers a switching frequency option of 400 kHz or 300 kHz.  Operating at 300 kHz will increase the amount of magnetization energy stored in the \ntransformer.  This is ideal for applications using synchronous \nrectification driven directly from the transformer secondary where this energy can be used to drive the catch MOSFET gate.\nTransformer Design\nIt is recommended that the forward converter transformer be \ndesigned for maximum operating flux swing of 1500 Gauss and \na peak flux density of 3500 Gauss. When operating at the maximum current limit of the selected DPA-Switch (during overload conditions), neither magnetic component (transformer \nand output inductor) should be allowed to saturate. When a \nlarger device than necessary has been selected, reducing the internal current limit close to the operating peak current limits overload power and minimizes the size of the secondary components.\nNo-load and Standby Consumption\nCycle skipping operation at light or no-load can significantly \nreduce power loss.  In addition this operating mode ensures \nthat the output maintains regulation even without an external minimum load.  However, if cycle skipping is undesirable in a particular application, it can be avoided by adding sufficient \npre-load.\nDPA-Switch  Layout Considerations\nThe DPA-Switch can operate with large DRAIN current, the \nfollowing guidelines should be carefully followed.\nPrimary Side Connections\nThe tab of DPA-Switch R package is the intended return path for the high switching currents.  Therefore, the tab should be connected by wide, low impedance traces back to the input \ndecoupling capacitor.  The SOURCE pin should not be used to \nreturn the power currents; incorrect operation of the device may result. The SOURCE is only intended as a signal ground. The device tab (SOURCE) is the correct connection for high current with the R package.\nThe CONTROL pin bypass capacitor should be located as  \nclose as possible to the SOURCE and CONTROL pins and its SOURCE connection trace should not be shared by the main \nMOSFET switching currents. All SOURCE pin referenced \ncomponents connected to the LINE-SENSE or EXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pins should also be located closely between their respective pin and SOURCE.  Once again, the SOURCE connection trace of these components should not be shared by \nthe main MOSFET switching currents. It is critical that the tab  \n(SOURCE) power switching currents are returned to the input \ncapacitor through a separate trace that is not shared by the components connected to CONTROL, LINE-SENSE or \nEXTERNAL CURRENT LIMIT pins. \n Any traces to the L or X pins should be kept as short as possible and away from the DRAIN trace to prevent noise coupling. LINE-SENSE resistor (R1 in Figure 25) should be \nlocated close to the LINE-SENSE pin to minimize the trace \nlength on the LINE-SENSE pin side.\nIn addition to the CONTROL pin capacitor (C6 in Figure 25), a \nhigh frequency bypass capacitor in parallel is recommended as \nclose as possible between SOURCE and CONTROL pins for better noise immunity.  The feedback optocoupler output should also be located close to the CONTROL and SOURCE pins of DPA-Switch.\nHeat Sinking\nTo maximize heat sinking of the DPA-Switch R or G package and the other power components, special thermally conductive PC board material (aluminum clad PC board) is recommended.  \nThis has an aluminum sheet bonded to the PC board during the \nmanufacturing process to provide heat sinking directly and allow the attachment of an external heat sink.  If normal PC board material is used (such as FR4), providing copper areas on \nRev. U 06/1519\nDPA422-426\nwww.power.com both sides of the board and using thicker copper will improve \nheat sinking.\nIf an aluminum clad board is used then shielding of switching \nnodes is recommended.  This consists of an area of copper placed directly underneath switching nodes such as the drain node, and output diode to provide an electrostatic shield to \nprevent coupling to the aluminum substrate.  These areas are \nconnected to input negative in the case of the primary and output return for secondary.  This reduces the amount of capacitive coupling into the insulated aluminum substrate that can then appear on the output as ripple and high frequency \nnoise.\nQuick Design Checklist\nAs with any power supply design, all DPA-Switch designs \nshould be verified on the bench to make sure that component specifications limits are not exceeded under worst case \nconditions. The following minimum set of tests for DPA-Switch \nforward converters is strongly recommended:\n1. Maximum drain voltage – Verify that peak VDS does not \nexceed minimum BVDSS at highest input voltage and maxi-\nmum overload output power. It is normal, however, to have additional margin of approximately 25 V below BV\nDSS to allow \nfor other power supply component unit-to-unit variations. Maximum overload output power occurs when the output is \nloaded to a level just before the power supply goes into auto-\nrestart (loss of regulation).\n2. Transformer reset margin – Drain voltage should also be checked at highest input voltage with a severe load step  (50-100%) to verify adequate transformer reset margin. This \ntest shows the duty cycle at high input voltage, placing the most demand on the transformer reset circuit.\n3. Maximum drain current – At maximum ambient temperature, \nmaximum input voltage and maximum output load, verify drain current waveforms at start-up for any signs of trans-\nformer or output inductor saturation and excessive leading \nedge current spikes. DPA-Switch has a leading edge blanking time of 100 ns to prevent premature termination of the on cycle. Verify that the leading edge current spike does \nnot extend beyond the blanking period.\n4. Thermal check – At maximum output power, minimum input \nvoltage and maximum ambient temperature, verify that temperature specifications are not exceeded for the  \ntransformer, output diodes, output choke(s) and output \ncapacitors. The DPA-Switch is fully protected against over-temperature conditions by its thermal shutdown feature. It is recommended that sufficient heat sinking is provided to keep \nthe tab temperature at or below 115 °C (R package), \nSOURCE pins at or below 100 °C (P/G packages) under worst case continuous load conditions (at low input voltage, maximum ambient and full load). This provides adequate margin to minimum thermal shutdown temperature  \n(130 °C) to account for part-to-part R\nDS(ON) variation. When \nmonitoring device temperatures, note that the junction-to-\ncase thermal resistance should be accounted for when \nestimating die temperature.\nDesign Tools\nUp-to-date information on design tools is available at the Power \nIntegrations website: www.power.com.\nRev.

Breakdown voltage may be checked against minimum BVDSS specification by ramping the DRAIN pin voltage up to but not \nexceeding minimum BVDSS. \nD. It is possible to start up and operate DPA-Switch at DRAIN voltages well below 16 V.  However, the CONTROL pin charging current is reduced, which affects start-up time, auto-restart frequency, and auto-restart duty cycle.  Refer to Figure 45, the characteristic graph on CONTROL pin charge current (I\nC) vs. DRAIN voltage for low voltage operation characteristics. \nRev.

DP A-Switch General Test Circuit.Figure 31.  CONTROL Pin I-V Characteristic.\nRev. U 06/1527\nDPA422-426\nwww.power.com The following precautions should be followed when testing \nDPA-Switch by itself outside of a power supply. The schematic shown in Figure 33 is suggested for laboratory testing of  \nDPA-Switch.  \nWhen the DRAIN pin supply is turned on, the part will be in the \nauto-restart mode.  The CONTROL pin voltage will be \noscillating at a low frequency between 4.8 V and 5.8 V and the \ndrain is turned on every eighth cycle of the CONTROL pin oscillation.  If the CONTROL pin power supply is turned on while in this auto-restart mode, there is only a 12.5% chance \nthat the CONTROL pin oscillation will be in the correct state \n(drain active state) so that the continuous drain voltage waveform may be observed.  It is recommended that the V\nC \npower supply be turned on first and the DRAIN pin power supply second if continuous drain voltage waveforms are to be \nobserved.  The 12.5% chance of being in the correct state is \ndue to the divide-by-8 counter.  Temporarily shorting the CONTROL pin to the SOURCE pin will reset DPA-Switch, which then will come up in the correct state.BENCH TEST PRECAUTIONS FOR EVALUATION OF ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nTypical Performance Characteristics\n0.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.1\n1.0\n-230 -180 -130 -80 -30\nIX (µA)Current Limit\n(Normalized to Internal Current Limit) 0\nPI-2838-032202\nFigure 34.
