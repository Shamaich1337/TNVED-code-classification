It includes high impedance, differential X and Y inputs,  \nand a high impedance summing input (Z). The lo w impedance \noutput voltage is a nominal 10 V full scale provided by a buried \nZener. The AD633 is the first product to offer these features in \nmodestly priced 8 -lead PDIP and SOIC packages.  \nThe AD633 is laser calibrated to a guaranteed total accuracy of  \n2% of full scale. Nonlinearity for the Y input is typically less \nthan 0.1% and noise referred to the output is typically less than  \n100 µV rms  in a 10 Hz to 10 kHz bandwidth. A 1 MHz bandwidth,  \n20 V/ µs slew rate , and the ability to drive capacitive loads  make \nthe AD633 useful in a wide variety of applications where \nsimplicity and cost ar e key concerns.  \nThe versatility of the AD633 is not compromised by its simplicity. \nThe Z input provides access to the output buffer amplifier, enabling \nthe user to sum the outputs of two or more mu ltipliers, increase \nthe multiplier gain, convert the output voltage to a  current, and \nconfigure a variety of applications.  For further information, see \nthe Multiplier App lication Guide . The AD633 is available in 8 -lead PDIP and SOIC packages . It is \nspecified to operate over the 0°C to 70°C commercial temperature  \nrange (J Grade) or the − 40°C to +85°C industrial tem perature \nrange (A Grade ). \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS  \n1. The AD633 is a complete four -quadrant multiplier offered \nin low cost 8 -lead SOIC and PDIP packages. The result is a \nproduct that is cost effective and easy to apply.  \n2. No external components or expensive user calibration are  \nrequired to apply the AD633. \n3. Monolithic construction and laser calibration make the  \ndevice stable and reliable.  \n4. High ( 10 MΩ) input resistances make signal source \nloading negligible. \n5. Power supply voltages can range from ±8 V to ±18 V.  T h e  \ninternal scaling voltage is generated by a stable Zener diode;  \nmultiplier accuracy is essentially supply insensitive. \n Rev.

K | Page 7  of 20 \nAD633  Data Sheet  \n \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nThe AD633 is a low cost multiplier comprising a translinear  \ncore, a buri ed Zener reference, and a unity -gain connected  \noutput amplifier with an accessible summi ng node. Figure 1 \nshows the functional block diagram. The differential X and Y \ninputs are converted to diff erential currents by voltage -to-current \nconverters . The product of these currents is generated by the \nmulti plying core. A buried Zener reference provides an overall  \nscale factor of 10 V . The sum of (X × Y)/10 + Z i s then applied  \nto the output am plifier. The amplifier summing N ode Z allows \nthe user to add two or more multiplier outputs, convert the  \noutput voltage to a current, and configure various analog computational  functions.  \nInspection of the block diagram shows the overall transfer function  is \n()()ZY2Y1X2 X1W +−−=V10 (1) ERROR SOURCES  \nMultiplier errors consist primarily of input and output offsets,  \nscale fa ctor error, and nonlinearity in the multiplying core. The  \ninput and output offsets can be eliminated by using the optional  \ntrim of Figure 11. This scheme reduces the net  error to scale \nfactor errors (gain error) and an irreducible  nonlinearity \ncomponent in the multiplying core. The X and Y nonlinearities  \nare typically  0.4% and 0.1% of full scale, respectively. Scale \nfactor error is  typically 0.25% of full scale. The high impedance \nZ input should  always reference the ground point of  the driven \nsystem, particularly if it is remote. Likewise, the differential X \nand Y  inputs should reference their respective grounds to \nrealize  the full accuracy of the AD633. \n±50mV\nTOAPPROPRI ATE\nINPUT TERMINAL\n(FOR EXAMPLE, X2, Y2, Z)50kΩ\n1kΩ300kΩ+VS\n–VS\n00786-010 \nFigure 11.

K | Page 8  of 20 \nData Sheet  AD633  \n \nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nThe AD633 is well suited for such applications as modulation  \nand demodulation, automatic gain control, power measure ment,  \nvoltage -controlled amplifiers, and frequency doublers. T hese \napplications show the pin connections for the AD633JN  (8-lead \nPDIP), which differs from the AD633JR  (8-lead SOIC).  \nMULTIPLIER CONNECTIO NS \nFigure 12 shows the basic connections for multiplication. The X  \nand Y inputs normally have their negative nodes grounded,  but \nthey are fully differential, and in m any applications , the grounded  \ninputs may be reversed (to facilitate interfacing with  signals of a \nparticular polarity while achieving some desired output polarity) , \nor both may be driven.  \nAD633JNX11\nX22\nY13\nY24+VS8\nW 7\nZ6\n–VS5X\nINPUT\nY\nINPUT+\n–\n+\n–0.1µF\n0.1µF+15V\n–15VOPTIONA L SUMMING\nINPU T, ZW = + Z(X1 – X2)(Y1 – Y2)\n10V\n00786-0 11\n \nFigure 12. Basic Multiplier Connections  (See the Model Results  Section ) \nSQUARING AND FREQUENCY DOUBLING  \nAs is shown in Figure 13, squaring of an input signal, E, is \nachieved  simply by connecting the X and Y inputs in parallel to  \nproduce an output of E2/10 V . The input can have either polarity,  \nbut the output is  positive. However, the output polarity can be \nreversed by interchanging the X or Y inputs. The Z input can be \nused to add a further signal to the output.  \nAD633JNX11 E\nX22\nY13\nY24+VS8\nW 7\nZ6\n–VS50.1µF\n0.1µF+15V\n–15VW =E2\n10V\n00786-012 \nFigure 13.

This can be avoided using  \nthe connections shown in Figure 14, where an RC network is  \nused to generate two signals whose product has no dc term.

Bounceless Frequency Doubler (See the Model Results Section ) \nAt ω o = 1/CR, the X input leads the input signal by 45°  (and is \nattenuated by √2), and the Y input lags the X input by 45° (and \nis also attenuated by √2). Because  the X and Y inputs are 90°  out of \nphase, the response of the circuit is  (satisfying Equation 3 ) \n()( )( )°+ω°+ω = 45 sin245 sin2 V101\n0 0 tEtEW  \n()()tE\n02\n2sinV40ω =  (4) \nwhich has no dc component. Resistor R1 and Resistor R2 are \nincluded to  restore the output amplitude to 10 V for an input \namplitude of 10 V .  \nThe amplitude of the output is only a weak function of frequenc y; \nthe output amplitude is 0.5% too low at ω = 0.9 ω 0 and ω 0 = 1.1 ω 0. \nGENERATING INVERSE F UNCTIONS  \nInverse functions of multiplication, such as division and square \nrooting, can be implemented by placing a multiplier in the feedback  \nloop of an op amp. Figur e 15 shows how to implement square \nrooting with the transfer function  for the condition E < 0.  \nThe 1N4148 diode is required to prevent latchup, which can \noccur in such applications if the input were to change polarity, even momentarily.  \n()V 10E W−=  (5) \nAD633JNX11\nX22\nY13\nY24+VS8\nW 7\nZ6\n–VS50.1µF\nE < 0V\n–15V+15V\nAD7110.1µF\n10kΩ10kΩ\n000786-0140.1µF\nW = √ –(10V)E0.01µF+15V\n–15V7\n4362\n0.1µF1N4148\n \nFigure 15.

R2 and R5 provide controlled current output operation. The currents are integrated in capacitors C1 \nand C2, and the resulting voltages at high impedance are applied \nto the X inputs of the next AD633 . The frequency control input, E\nC, connected to the Y inputs, varies the integrator gains with a calibration of 100 Hz/V . The accuracy is limited by the Y input offsets. The practical tuning range of this circuit is 100:1. C2 (proportional to C1 and C3), R3, and R4 provide regenerative \nfeedback to start and maintain oscillation. The diode bridge, D1 \nthrough D4 (1N914s), and Zener diode D5 provide economical temperature stabilization and amplitude stabilization at ±8.5 V by degenerative damping. The output from the second integrator \n(10 V sin ωt) has the lowest distortion.  \nAUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL (AGC) AMPLIFIERS \nFigure 23 shows an AGC circuit that uses an rms-to-dc \nconverter to measure the amplitude of the output waveform. \nThe AD633 and A1, half of an AD712 dual op amp, form a \nvoltage-controlled amplifier. The rms-to-dc converter, an AD736, measures the rms value of the output signal. Its \noutput drives A2, an integrator/comparator whose output controls the gain of the voltage-controlled amplifier. The 1N4148 diode prevents the output of A2 from going negative. \nR8, a 50 kΩ variable resistor, sets the output level of the circuit. \nFeedback around the loop forces the voltages at the inverting \nand noninverting inputs of A2 to be equal, thus the AGC. \n \nAD633JNX11\nX22\nY13\nY24+VS8\nW 7\nZ6\n–VS50.1µF\n0.1µFC1\n0.01µF+15V\n–15VAD633JNX11\nX22\nY13\nY24+VS8\nW 7\nZ6\n–VS50.1µF+15V\n–15VR5\n16kΩR3\n330kΩR4\n16kΩ\nC3\n0.01µFC2\n0.01µF\n(10V) sin ωt\n0.1µFR2\n16kΩR1\n1kΩD5\n1N5236\nD1\n1N914\nD2\n1N914D31N914\nD41N914\nf =EC\n10V= kHz(10V) cos ωt\nEC\n00786-021 \nFigure 22.

Although impossible to \ndemonstrate all of the multiplier functions in every available program, Figure 24 through Figure 41 demonstrate how the schematic and graph for simple dc, sin\n(x), and pulse \napplications appear in three popular SPICE programs. If a simulator is not shown here, a good way to progress is to start with a basic dc circuit to verify that the circuit converges and then continue with waveforms that are more complex. When analyzing nonlinear devices such as multipliers, the most \ncommon simulation issue is convergence, the iterative process \nby which SPICE seeks the initial dc bias condition before \ncompletely solving the circuit and displaying a graph. \nFigure 24 through Figure 41 are arranged schematic first, \nfollowed by the graphic result. If the user has a problem with a \nsimulator, the most efficient fix is to contact applications \nsupport for the program in use. \nEXAMPLES OF DC, SIN, AND PULSE SOLUTIONS \nUSING MULTISIM \n00786-124 \nFigure 24.

Figure 42 is a photograph of the AD633 evaluation board. \n00786-024\n \nFigure 42. AD633  Evaluation Board \nAny dual-polarity power supply capable of providing 10 mA or \ngreater is all that is required to perform the intended tests, in addition to whatever test equipment the user wants. \nReferring to the schematic in Figure 49, inputs to the multiplier are \ndifferential and dc-coupled. Three-position slide switches enhance \nflexibility by enabling the multiplier inputs to be connected to an active signal source, to ground, or to a test loop connected directly to the device pin for direct measurements, such as bias current. Inputs may be connected single ended or differentially, \nbut must have a dc path to ground for bias current. If the \nimpedance of an input source is non-zero, an equal value impedance must be connected to the opposite polarity input to \navoid introducing additional offset voltage. \nThe AD633-EV ALZ  can be configured for multiplier or divider \noperation by switch S1. Refer to Figure 16 for divider circuit \nconnections. \nFigure 43 through Figure 46 are the signal, power, and ground-\nplane artworks, and Figure 47 shows the component and circuit side silkscreen.
