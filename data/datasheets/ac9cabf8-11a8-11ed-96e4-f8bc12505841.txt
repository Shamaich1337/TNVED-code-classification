The \nHMC 902LP3E is housed in a leadless 3  mm × 3 mm plastic surface  \nmount package. The amplifier operates between 5 GHz and \n11 GHz , providing 19 .5 dB of small signal gain, 1.8  dB n oise figure, \nand 28 dBm  of output IP3 , whi le requiring only 80 mA from a \n3.5 V supply.  The P1dB output power of 16 dBm enables the LNA to function \nas a local oscillator ( LO) driver for balanced, I/Q , or image rejec t \nmixers. The HMC902LP3E  also features inputs/outputs  that are \ndc blocked and internally matched to 50  Ω, making it ideal for \nhigh capacity microwave radios and C  band, very small aperture \nterminal ( VSAT ) applications.  \n \n \nHMC902LP3E Data Sheet \n \nRev.

E | Page 9 of 13 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe HMC902LP3E is a GaAs , MMIC , pHEMT , LNA . The \nHMC902LP3E amplifier uses two gain stages  in series. T he basic \nschematic for the amplifier is shown in Figure 21, which forms a \nLNA  opera ting from 5 GHz t o 11 GHz with excellent noise \nfigure performance.   \nVDD1 VDD2\nVGG1 VGG2RFIN RFOUT\n14524-021 \nFigure 21. Basic Schematic for HMC902LP3E   \n The HMC902LP3E has single -ended input and output ports w ith \nimpedances  that are nominally equal to 50 Ω over the 5  GHz to \n11 GHz f requency range. Consequently, the device can be directly  \ninser ted into a 50 Ω system with no required impedance matching \ncircuitry, which also means multiple HMC902LP3E  amplifiers \ncan be cascaded back to back without the need f or external \nmatching circuitry.  \nThe input and output impedances are sufficiently stable vs. \nvariations in temperature and supply voltage that no impedance \nmatching compensation is required.  \nIt is critical to supply very low inductance ground connections \nto the package ground pad  to en sure stable operation. To achieve \noptimal performance from the  HMC902LP3E and to prevent \ndamage to the device, do not exceed the absolute maximum \nratings.  \n \n \nHMC902LP3E Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 10 of 13 APPLICATIONS  INFORMATION  \nThe HMC902LP3E has V GG1 and V GG2 optional gate bias pins. \nWhen these pads are left open, the amplifier runs  in sel f biased \noperation with typical I DQ = 80 mA. Figure 23 shows the basic \nconnections for operating the HMC902LP3E in self  biased \noperation mode. Both RF IN and RF OUT ports of HMC902LP3E  \nhave on -chip dc block capacitors , eliminating the need  for \nexternal ac coupling capacitors.  \nWhen using the optional V GG1 and V GG2 gate bias pins , use the  \nrecommended bias sequencing to prevent damage to the amplifier.  \nThe r ecommended bias sequence during power -up is as follows: \n1. Connect  to GND . \n2. Set V GG1 and V GG2 to −2.0 V .  \n3. Set VDD1 and V DD2 to 3.5 V . \n4. Increase V GG1 and V GG2 to achieve typical I DQ = 80 mA . \n5. Apply the RF signal . The recommended bias sequence during power -down is as follows:  \n1. Turn off the RF signal . \n2. Decre ase VGG1 and V GG2 to −2.0 V to achieve typical \nIDQ = 0 mA . \n3. Decrease VDD1 and V DD2 to 0 V . \n4. Increase VGG1 and V GG2 to 0 V . \nThe bias conditions previously listed (V DD = 3.5 V and I DQ = \n80 mA) are the recommended operating points to achieve \noptimum performance. The data used in this data sheet was \ntaken with the recommended bias conditions.  \nWhen u sing the HMC902LP3E with different bias conditions, \ndifferent performance than what is shown in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics  section can  result. Decreasing the \nVDD level has negligible effect on gain and NF performance, but \nreduces the P1dB , see Figure 18. For applications where  the \nP1dB requirement is not stringent, the HMC902LP3E  can be \ndown biased to red uce power consumption.  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n    \n \n \n   \nData Sheet HMC902LP3E \nRev.
