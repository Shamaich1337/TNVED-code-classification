[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a technical specialist with expertise in electronics. Your task is to analyze datasheets for electronic components and provide a concise summary of the product’s key characteristics and specifications. In addition, you need to gather textual information about the component, including its description and typical applications.Instructions:    Identify the correct component in the datasheet using the provided product code.    Summarize key parameters, including:        Voltage ratings        Current ratings        Power consumption        Operating temperature range        Package type        Special features or notes (if applicable)        Moisture Sensetive Level JEDEC J-STD-020E    Provide a short description of the component, including what it is (e.g., transistor, microcontroller, sensor) and its primary function.    Explain typical applications for the component (e.g., power management, signal processing, data storage, etc.).    Be thorough and accurate: Ensure the information corresponds specifically to the product code, as some datasheets cover multiple variants.Your goal is to create a clear and accurate technical summary that includes both key specifications and a description of what the component is used for.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Give me information about the component of FMP200JR-52-470K production of YAGEO from the text:  \n DATA SHEET\nMETAL  \nHigh Power\nRoHS compliant\nProduct specification – October 25, 2021  V.2 \n  \n \n \n  A SHEET\n FILM RESISTORS\nHigh Power , Flameproof\nFMP Series\n±1%,  ±5% \n1/2W to 3W\nRoHS compliant  & Halogen Free\n \n\nwww.yageo.com\n Oct. 25, 2021   V.0  \n  \n Metal Film Resistors  \n    2 \n16 \n Product Specification\n FMP \n Through Hole Resistor s \n \n \n \n \nAPPLICATIONS  \n\x9f All general purpose \napplications \n\x9f Power applications \n \n \n \nFEATURES  \n\x9f Ultra miniature size \n\x9f Wide resistance range \n\x9f High power rating \n\x9f High stability \n\x9f PPAP ready (FMP-50) \n\x9f Flameproof coating equivalent \nto UL94V-0 \n\x9f RoHS compliant & \nhalogen-free  \n  \nORDERING  INFORMATION  \nPart number of the high power, flameproof metal film resistor are \nidentified by the series, power rating, tolerance, packing , temperature \ncoefficient, forming  and resistance value. \n \nPART NUMBER  \n \nFMP     200     F     T     F     52-     100R   \n(1)       (2)     (3)    (4)    (5)    (6)      (7)  \n(1) SERIES \nFMP Series \n \n(2) POWER RATING \n-50 = 1/2W \n100 = 1W \n200 = 2W \n 3WS = 3W \n300= 3W \n \n(3) TOLERANCE \nF = ±1% \n J = ±5% \n(4) PACKAGING \nR = Reel Pack \nT = Box Pack B = Bulk \n \n(5) TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTANCE \nE = ±50ppm/°C \nF = ±100ppm/°C - = Based on spec. \n \n \n(6) FORMING \n26- = 26mm  \n52- = 52.4mm  \n52J = 52.4mm, Φd=0.8±0.05mm  \n52E = 52.4mm, Φd=0.70±0.05mm  \n73- = 73mm  \nM = M Type Forming \nF = F Type Forming \nFK = FK Type Forming FFK = FFK Type Forming \nFKK = FKK Type Forming \nFT = FT Type Forming \nMT = MTsert \nPN = PANAsert \nAV = AVIsert \n \n(7) RESISTANCE VALUE \nE24 & E96 Series  \nExample:  \n100R = 100 Ω, 10K = 10,000 Ω, 1M = 1,000,000 Ω   \n\nwww.yageo.com\n Oct. 25, 2021   V.0  \n  \n Metal Film Resistors  \n    3 \n16 \n Product Specification\n FMP \n Through Hole Resistor s \n \nDIMENSIONS  \nUnit: mm  \n Ultra \nMiniature L ψD H ψd \nFMP-50 3.4 ± 0.3 1.9 ± 0.2 28 ± 2.0 0.45 ±0.05 \nFMP100 6.3 ± 0.5 2.4 ± 0.2 28 ± 2.0 0.55 ±0.05 \nFMP200 9.0 ± 0.5 3.9 ± 0.3 26 ± 2.0 0.55 ±0.05 \nFMP3WS 11.5 ± 1.0 4.5 ± 0.5 35 ± 2.0 0.8±0.05 \nFMP300 15.5± 1.0 5.0 ± 0.5 33 ± 2.0 0.8±0.05 \n \nDERATING CURVE  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS  \n \nCHARACTERISTICS FMP-50 FMP100 FMP200 FMP3WS FMP300 \nPower Rating at 70 °C 1/2W 1W 2W 3W 3W \nMaximum Working Voltage 200V 350V 500V 500V 750V \nMaximum Overload Voltage 400V 600V 700V 700V 1000V \nVoltage Proof on Insulation 300V 500V 500V 500V 500V \nResistance Range 1Ω ~ 4M7Ω for E24 & E96 series value  \nOperating Temp.
