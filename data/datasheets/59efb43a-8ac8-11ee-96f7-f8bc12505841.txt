All rights reserved.\nSignal Descriptions\nTable 2: Signal Descriptions\nSignal Type Description\nDQ1 Output Serial data:  The DQ1 output signal is used to transfer data serially out of the device.\nData is shifted out on the falling edge of the serial clock (C).\nDQ0 Input Serial data:  The DQ0 input signal is used to transfer data serially into the device. It\nreceives commands, addresses, and the data to be programmed. Values are latched on\nthe rising edge of the serial clock (C).\nC Input Clock:  The C input signal provides the timing of the serial interface. Commands, ad-\ndresses, or data present at serial data input (DQ0) is latched on the rising edge of the\nserial clock (C). Data on DQ1 changes after the falling edge of C.\nS# Input Chip select:  When the S# input signal is HIGH, the device is deselected and DQ1 is at\nhigh impedance. Unless an internal PROGRAM, ERASE, or WRITE STATUS REGISTER cy-\ncle is in progress, the device will be in the standby power mode (not the deep power-\ndown mode). Driving S# LOW enables the device, placing it in the active power mode.\nAfter power-up, a falling edge on S# is required prior to the start of any command.\nHOLD# Input Hold:  The HOLD# signal is used to pause any serial communications with the device\nwithout deselecting the device. During the hold condition, DQ1 is High-Z. DQ0 and C\nare "Don’t Care." To start the hold condition, the device must be selected, with S#\ndriven LOW.\nW#/V PP Input Write protect:  The W#/V PP signal is both a control input and a power supply pin. The\ntwo functions are selected by the voltage range applied to the pin. If the W#/V PP input\nis kept in a low voltage range (0 V to V CC) the pin is seen as a control input. The W#\ninput signal is used to freeze the size of the area of memory that is protected against\nprogram or erase commands as specified by the values in BP2, BP1, and BP0 bits of the\nStatus Register. V PP acts as an additional power supply if it is in the range of V PPH, as\ndefined in the AC Measurement Conditions table. Avoid applying V PPH to the W#/V PP\npin during a BULK ERASE operation.\nVCC Power Device core power supply:  Source voltage.\nVSS Ground Ground:  Reference for the V CC supply voltage.\nDNU – Do not use.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nSignal Descriptions\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nSPI Modes\nThese devices can be driven by a microcontroller with its serial peripheral interface\n(SPI) running in either of the following two SPI modes:\n• CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0\n• CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1\nFor these two modes, input data is latched in on the rising edge of serial clock (C), and\noutput data is available from the falling edge of C.\nThe difference between the two modes is the clock polarity when the bus master is in\nstandby mode and not transferring data:\n• C remains at 0 for (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)\n• C remains at 1 for (CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1)\nFigure 4: SPI Modes Supported\nC\nMSBCPHA\nDQ00\n1CPOL\n0\n1\nDQ1C\nMSB\nBecause only one device is selected at a time, only one device drives the serial data out-\nput (DQ1) line at a time, while the other devices are High-Z. An example of three devi-\nces connected to an MCU on an SPI bus is shown here.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nSPI Modes\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

WRITE PROTECT (W#) and HOLD# should be driven HIGH or LOW as appropriate.\n2. Resistors (R) ensure that the memory device is not selected if the bus master leaves the\nS# line High-Z.\n3. The bus master may enter a state where all I/O are High-Z at the same time; for exam-\nple, when the bus master is reset. Therefore, C must be connected to an external pull-\ndown resistor so that when all I/O are High-Z, S# is pulled HIGH while C is pulled LOW.\nThis ensures that S# and C do not go HIGH at the same time and that the tSHCH require-\nment is met.\n4. The typical value of R is 100k Ω, assuming that the time constant R × C p (Cp = parasitic\ncapacitance of the bus line) is shorter than the time during which the bus master leaves\nthe SPI bus High-Z.\n5. Example: Given that C p = 50pF (R × C p = 5μs), the application must ensure that the bus\nmaster never leaves the SPI bus High-Z for a time period shorter than 5 μs.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nSPI Modes\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nOperating Features\nPage Programming\nTo program one data byte, two commands are required: WRITE ENABLE, which is one\nbyte, and a PAGE PROGRAM sequence, which is four bytes plus data. This is followed by\nthe internal PROGRAM cycle of duration t PP. To spread this overhead, the PAGE PRO-\nGRAM command allows up to 256 bytes to be programmed at a time (changing bits\nfrom 1 to 0), provided they lie in consecutive addresses on the same page of memory. To\noptimize timings, it is recommended to use the PAGE PROGRAM command to program\nall consecutive targeted bytes in a single sequence than to use several PAGE PROGRAM\nsequences with each containing only a few bytes.\nSector Erase, Bulk Erase\nThe PAGE PROGRAM command allows bits to be reset from 1 to 0. Before this can be\napplied, the bytes of memory need to have been erased to all 1s (FFh). This can be ach-\nieved a sector at a time using the SECTOR ERASE command, or throughout the entire\nmemory using the BULK ERASE command. This starts an internal ERASE cycle of dura-\ntion t SE or t BE. The ERASE command must be preceded by a WRITE ENABLE command.\nPolling during a Write, Program, or Erase Cycle\nAn improvement in the time to complete the following commands can be achieved by\nnot waiting for the worst case delay (t W, tPP, tSE, or t BE).\n• WRITE STATUS REGISTER\n• PROGRAM\n• ERASE (SECTOR ERASE, BULK ERASE)\nThe write in progress (WIP) bit is provided in the status register so that the application\nprogram can monitor this bit in the status register, polling it to establish when the pre-\nvious WRITE cycle, PROGRAM cycle, or ERASE cycle is complete.\nActive Power, Standby Power, and Deep Power-Down\nWhen chip select (S#) is LOW, the device is selected, and in the ACTIVE POWER mode.\nWhen S# is HIGH, the device is deselected, but could remain in the ACTIVE POWER\nmode until all internal cycles have completed (PROGRAM, ERASE, WRITE STATUS\nREGISTER). The device then goes in to the STANDBY POWER mode. The device con-\nsumption drops to I CC1.\nThe DEEP POWER-DOWN mode is entered when the DEEP POWER-DOWN command\nis executed. The device consumption drops further to I CC2. The device remains in this\nmode until the RELEASE FROM DEEP POWER-DOWN command is executed. While in\nthe DEEP POWER-DOWN mode, the device ignores all WRITE, PROGRAM, and ERASE\ncommands. This provides an extra software protection mechanism when the device is\nnot in active use, by protecting the device from inadvertent WRITE, PROGRAM, or\nERASE operations. For further information, see the DEEP POWER DOWN command.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nOperating Features\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev. R 06/18 EN 12Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2013 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nStatus Register\nThe status register contains a number of status and control bits that can be read or set\n(as appropriate) by specific commands. For a detailed description of the status register\nbits, see READ STATUS REGISTER (page 22).\nData Protection by Protocol\nNon-volatile memory is used in environments that can include excessive noise. The fol-\nlowing capabilities help protect data in these noisy environments.\nPower on reset and an internal timer (t PUW ) can provide protection against inadvertent\nchanges while the power supply is outside the operating specification.\nPROGRAM, ERASE, and WRITE STATUS REGISTER commands are checked before they\nare accepted for execution to ensure they consist of a number of clock pulses that is a\nmultiple of eight.\nAll commands that modify data must be preceded by a WRITE ENABLE command to set\nthe write enable latch (WEL) bit.\nIn addition to the low power consumption feature, the DEEP POWER-DOWN mode of-\nfers extra software protection since all PROGRAM, and ERASE commands are ignored\nwhen the device is in this mode.\nSoftware Data Protection\nMemory can be configured as read-only using the block protect bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) as\nshown in the Protected Area Sizes table.\nHardware Data Protection\nHardware data protection is implemented using the write protect signal applied on the\nW# pin. This freezes the status register in a read-only mode. In this mode, the block pro-\ntect (BP) bits and the status register write disable bit (SRWD) are protected.\nTable 3: Protected Area Sizes\nStatus Register Content Memory Content\nBP Bit 2 BP Bit 1 BP Bit 0 Protected Area Unprotected Area\n0 0 0 none All sectors (sectors 0 to 63)\n0 0 1 Upper 64th (sector 63) Lower 63/64ths (sectors 0 to 62)\n0 1 0 Upper 32nd (sectors 62 and 63) Lower 31/32nds (sectors 0 to 61)\n0 1 1 Upper 16th (sectors 60 and 63) Lower 15/16ths (sectors 0 to 59)\n1 0 0 Upper 8th (sectors 56 to 63) Lower 7/8ths (sectors 0 to 55)\n1 0 1 Upper 4th (sectors 48 to 63) Lower 3/4ths (sectors 0 to 47)\n1 1 0 Upper half (sectors 32 to 63) Lower half (sectors 0 to 31)\n1 1 1 All sectors (sectors 0 to 63) none\nNote: 1. 0 0 0 = unprotected area (sectors): The device is ready to accept a BULK ERASE command\nonly if all block protect bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are 0.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nOperating Features\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

However, taking this signal LOW does not terminate\nany WRITE STATUS REGISTER, PROGRAM, or ERASE cycle that is currently in progress.\nTo enter the hold condition, the device must be selected, with S# LOW. The hold condi-\ntion starts on the falling edge of the HOLD# signal, if this coincides with serial clock (C)\nbeing LOW. The hold condition ends on the rising edge of the HOLD# signal, if this co-\nincides with C being LOW. If the falling edge does not coincide with C being LOW, the\nhold condition starts after C next goes LOW. Similarly, if the rising edge does not coin-\ncide with C being LOW, the hold condition ends after C next goes LOW.\nDuring the hold condition, DQ1 is HIGH impedance while DQ0 and C are Don’t Care.\nTypically, the device remains selected with S# driven LOW for the duration of the hold\ncondition. This ensures that the state of the internal logic remains unchanged from the\nmoment of entering the hold condition. If S# goes HIGH while the device is in the hold\ncondition, the internal logic of the device is reset. To restart communication with the\ndevice, it is necessary to drive HOLD# HIGH, and then to drive S# LOW. This prevents\nthe device from going back to the hold condition.\nFigure 6: Hold Condition Activation\nHOLD#C\nHOLD condition (standard use) HOLD condition (nonstandard use)M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nOperating Features\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

Then, the one-byte command code must be shifted\nin to the device, most significant bit first, on DQ0 and DQ1, each bit being latched on\nthe rising edges of C.\nEvery command sequence starts with a one-byte command code. Depending on the\ncommand, this command code might be followed by address or data bytes, by address\nand data bytes, or by neither address or data bytes. For the following commands, the\nshifted-in command sequence is followed by a data-out sequence. S# can be driven\nHIGH after any bit of the data-out sequence is being shifted out.\n• READ DATA BYTES (READ)\n• READ DATA BYTES at HIGHER SPEED\n• READ STATUS REGISTER\n• READ IDENTIFICATION\n• RELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN\n• READ ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE\nFor the following commands, S# must be driven HIGH exactly at a byte boundary. That\nis, after an exact multiple of eight clock pulses following S# being driven LOW, S# must\nbe driven HIGH. Otherwise, the command is rejected and not executed.\n• PAGE PROGRAM\n• SECTOR ERASE\n• BULK ERASE\n• WRITE STATUS REGISTER\n• WRITE ENABLE\n• WRITE DISABLE\n• DEEP POWER-DOWN\nAll attempts to access the memory array are ignored during a WRITE STATUS REGISTER\ncommand cycle, a PROGRAM command cycle, or an ERASE command cycle. In addi-\ntion, the internal cycle for each of these commands continues unaffected.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nCommand Set Overview\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nREAD IDENTIFICATION\nThe READ IDENTIFICATION command reads the following device identification data:\n• Manufacturer identification (1 byte): This is assigned by JEDEC.\n• Device identification (2 bytes): This is assigned by device manufacturer; the first byte\nindicates memory type and the second byte indicates device memory capacity.\n• A Unique ID code (UID) (17 bytes,16 available upon customer request): The first byte\ncontains length of data to follow; the remaining 16 bytes contain optional Customized\nFactory Data (CFD) content.\nTable 6: READ IDENTIFICATION Data Out Sequence\nManufacturer\nIdentificationDevice Identification UID\nMemory Type Memory Capacity CFD Length CFD Content\n20h 20h 16h 10h 16 bytes\nNote: 1. The CFD bytes are read-only and can be programmed with customer data upon demand.\nIf customers do not make requests, the devices are shipped with all the CFD bytes pro-\ngrammed to zero.\nA READ IDENTIFICATION command is not decoded while an ERASE or PROGRAM cy-\ncle is in progress and has no effect on a cycle in progress. The READ IDENTIFICATION\ncommand must not be issued while the device is in DEEP POWER-DOWN mode.\nThe device is first selected by driving S# LOW. Then the 8-bit command code is shifted\nin and content is shifted out on DQ1 as follows: the 24-bit device identification that is\nstored in the memory, the 8-bit CFD length, followed by 16 bytes of CFD content. Each\nbit is shifted out during the falling edge of serial clock (C).\nThe READ IDENTIFICATION command is terminated by driving S# HIGH at any time\nduring data output. When S# is driven HIGH, the device is put in the STANDBY POWER\nmode and waits to be selected so that it can receive, decode, and execute commands.\nFigure 10: READ IDENTIFICATION Command Sequence\nUID Device\nidentificationManufacturer\nidentificationHigh-Z DQ1\nMSB MSBDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTLSB LSB7 8 15 16 32 31 0\nC\nMSBDQ0LSB\nCommand\nMSBDOUTDOUTLSB\nDon’t CareM25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nREAD IDENTIFICATION\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

The status\nregister may be read at any time, even while a PROGRAM, ERASE, or WRITE STATUS\nREGISTER cycle is in progress. When one of these cycles is in progress, it is recommen-\nded to check the write in progress (WIP) bit before sending a new command to the de-\nvice.

All rights reserved.\nWIP Bit\nThe write in progress (WIP) bit indicates whether the memory is busy with a WRITE\nSTATUS REGISTER cycle, a PROGRAM cycle, or an ERASE cycle. When the WIP bit is set\nto 1, a cycle is in progress; when the WIP bit is set to 0, a cycle is not in progress.\nWEL Bit\nThe write enable latch (WEL) bit indicates the status of the internal write enable latch.\nWhen the WEL bit is set to 1, the internal write enable latch is set; when the WEL bit is\nset to 0, the internal write enable latch is reset and no WRITE STATUS REGISTER, PRO-\nGRAM, or ERASE command is accepted.\nBlock Protect Bits\nThe block protect bits are non-volatile. They define the size of the area to be software\nprotected against PROGRAM and ERASE commands. The block protect bits are written\nwith the WRITE STATUS REGISTER command.\nWhen one or more of the block protect bits is set to 1, the relevant memory area, as de-\nfined in the Protected Area Sizes table, becomes protected against PAGE PROGRAM and\nSECTOR ERASE commands. The block protect bits can be written provided that the\nhardware protected mode has not been set. The BULK ERASE command is executed on-\nly if all block protect bits are 0.\nSRWD Bit\nThe status register write disable (SRWD) bit is operated in conjunction with the write\nprotect (W#/V PP) signal. When the SRWD bit is set to 1 and W#/V PP is driven LOW, the\ndevice is put in the hardware protected mode. In the hardware protected mode, the\nnon-volatile bits of the status register (SRWD, and the block protect bits) become read-\nonly bits and the WRITE STATUS REGISTER command is no longer accepted for execu-\ntion.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nREAD STATUS REGISTER\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nWRITE STATUS REGISTER\nThe WRITE STATUS REGISTER command allows new values to be written to the status\nregister. Before the WRITE STATUS REGISTER command can be accepted, a WRITE EN-\nABLE command must have been executed previously. After the WRITE ENABLE com-\nmand has been decoded and executed, the device sets the write enable latch (WEL) bit.\nThe WRITE STATUS REGISTER command is entered by driving chip select (S#) LOW,\nfollowed by the command code and the data byte on serial data input (DQ0). The\nWRITE STATUS REGISTER command has no effect on b6, b5, b4, b1, and b0 of the sta-\ntus register. The status register b6, b5, and b4 are always read as "0". S# must be driven\nHIGH after the eighth bit of the data byte has been latched in. If not, the WRITE STATUS\nREGISTER command is not executed.\nFigure 13: WRITE STATUS REGISTER Command Sequence\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 0\nC\nMSBDQ0LSB\nCommand\nMSBLSB\nDINDINDINDINDINDINDINDINDIN\nAs soon as S# is driven HIGH, the self-timed WRITE STATUS REGISTER cycle is initi-\nated; its duration is tW. While the WRITE STATUS REGISTER cycle is in progress, the sta-\ntus register may still be read to check the value of the write in progress (WIP) bit. The\nWIP bit is 1 during the self-timed WRITE STATUS REGISTER cycle, and is 0 when the\ncycle is completed. Also, when the cycle is completed, the WEL bit is reset.\nThe WRITE STATUS REGISTER command allows the user to change the values of the\nblock protect bits (BP2, BP1, BP0). Setting these bit values defines the size of the area\nthat is to be treated as read-only, as defined in the Protected Area Sizes table.\nThe WRITE STATUS REGISTER command also allows the user to set and reset the status\nregister write disable (SRWD) bit in accordance with the write protect (W#/V PP) signal.\nThe SRWD bit and the W#/V PP signal allow the device to be put in the hardware protec-\nted (HPM) mode. The WRITE STATUS REGISTER command is not executed once the\nHPM is entered. The options for enabling the status register protection modes are sum-\nmarized here.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nWRITE STATUS REGISTER\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

Hardware protection: status register is not writable (SRWD, BP2, BP1, and BP0 bit values\ncannot be changed).\n5. PAGE PROGRAM, SECTOR ERASE, and BULK ERASE commands are not accepted.\nWhen the SRWD bit of the status register is 0 (its initial delivery state), it is possible to\nwrite to the status register provided that the WEL bit has been set previously by a WRITE\nENABLE command, regardless of whether the W#/V PP signal is driven HIGH or LOW.\nWhen the status register SRWD bit is set to 1, two cases need to be considered depend-\ning on the state of the W#/V PP signal:\n• If the W#/V PP signal is driven HIGH, it is possible to write to the status register provi-\nded that the WEL bit has been set previously by a WRITE ENABLE command.\n• If the W#/V PP signal is driven LOW, it is not possible to write to the status register even\nif the WEL bit has been set previously by a WRITE ENABLE command. Therefore, at-\ntempts to write to the status register are rejected, and are not accepted for execution.\nThe result is that all the data bytes in the memory area that have been put in SPM by\nthe status register block protect bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are also hardware protected\nagainst data modification.\nRegardless of the order of the two events, the HPM can be entered in either of the fol-\nlowing ways:\n• Setting the status register SRWD bit after driving the W#/V PP signal LOW\n• Driving the W#/V PP signal LOW after setting the status register SRWD bit.\nThe only way to exit the HPM is to pull the W#/V PP signal HIGH. If the W#/V PP signal is\npermanently tied HIGH, the HPM can never be activated. In this case, only the SPM is\navailable, using the status register block protect bits (BP2, BP1, BP0).M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nWRITE STATUS REGISTER\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

The command code for\nREAD DATA BYTES is followed by a 3-byte address (A23-A0), each bit being latched-in\nduring the rising edge of serial clock (C). Then the memory contents at that address is\nshifted out on serial data output (DQ1), each bit being shifted out at a maximum fre-\nquency fR during the falling edge of C.\nThe first byte addressed can be at any location. The address is automatically incremen-\nted to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out. Therefore, the entire\nmemory can be read with a single READ DATA BYTES command. When the highest ad-\ndress is reached, the address counter rolls over to 000000h, allowing the read sequence\nto be continued indefinitely.\nThe READ DATA BYTES command is terminated by driving S# HIGH. S# can be driven\nHIGH at any time during data output. Any READ DATA BYTES command issued while\nan ERASE, PROGRAM, or WRITE cycle is in progress is rejected without any effect on\nthe cycle that is in progress.\nFigure 14: READ DATA BYTES Command Sequence\nDon’t CareMSBDQ[0]LSB\nCommand\nA[MAX]A[MIN]7 8 Cx0\nC\nHigh-Z DQ1\nMSBDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTLSB\nDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUT\nNote: 1.

The command code for the\nREAD DATA BYTES at HIGHER SPEED command is followed by a 3-byte address (A23-\nA0) and a dummy byte, each bit being latched-in during the rising edge of serial clock\n(C). Then the memory contents at that address are shifted out on serial data output\n(DQ1) at a maximum frequency fC, during the falling edge of C.\nThe first byte addressed can be at any location. The address is automatically incremen-\nted to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out. Therefore, the entire\nmemory can be read with a single READ DATA BYTES at HIGHER SPEED command.\nWhen the highest address is reached, the address counter rolls over to 000000h, allow-\ning the read sequence to be continued indefinitely.\nThe READ DATA BYTES at HIGHER SPEED command is terminated by driving S# HIGH.\nS# can be driven HIGH at any time during data output.

All rights reserved.\nPAGE PROGRAM\nThe PAGE PROGRAM command allows bytes in the memory to be programmed, which\nmeans the bits are changed from 1 to 0. Before a PAGE PROGRAM command can be ac-\ncepted a WRITE ENABLE command must be executed. After the WRITE ENABLE com-\nmand has been decoded, the device sets the write enable latch (WEL) bit.\nThe PAGE PROGRAM command is entered by driving chip select (S#) LOW, followed by\nthe command code, three address bytes, and at least one data byte on serial data input\n(DQ0).\nIf the eight least significant address bits (A7-A0) are not all zero, all transmitted data that\ngoes beyond the end of the current page are programmed from the start address of the\nsame page; that is, from the address whose eight least significant bits (A7-A0) are all\nzero. S# must be driven LOW for the entire duration of the sequence.\nIf more than 256 bytes are sent to the device, previously latched data are discarded and\nthe last 256 data bytes are guaranteed to be programmed correctly within the same\npage. If less than 256 data bytes are sent to device, they are correctly programmed at the\nrequested addresses without any effects on the other bytes of the same page.\nFor optimized timings, it is recommended to use the PAGE PROGRAM command to\nprogram all consecutive targeted bytes in a single sequence rather than to use several\nPAGE PROGRAM sequences, each containing only a few bytes.\nS# must be driven HIGH after the eighth bit of the last data byte has been latched in.\nOtherwise the PAGE PROGRAM command is not executed.\nAs soon as S# is driven HIGH, the self-timed PAGE PROGRAM cycle is initiated; the cy-\ncles\'s duration is t PP. While the PAGE PROGRAM cycle is in progress, the status register\nmay be read to check the value of the write in progress (WIP) bit. The WIP bit is 1 during\nthe self-timed PAGE PROGRAM cycle, and 0 when the cycle is completed. At some un-\nspecified time before the cycle is completed, the write enable latch (WEL) bit is reset.\nA PAGE PROGRAM command is not executed if it applies to a page protected by the\nblock protect bits BP2, BP1, and BP0.\nFigure 16: PAGE PROGRAM Command Sequence\n7 8 Cx0\nC\nMSBDQ[0]LSB\nCommand\nA[MAX]A[MIN]\nMSBDINDINDINDINDINLSB\nDINDINDINDIN\nNote: 1.

Before\nthe SECTOR ERASE command can be accepted, a WRITE ENABLE command must have\nbeen executed previously. After the WRITE ENABLE command has been decoded, the\ndevice sets the write enable latch (WEL) bit.\nThe SECTOR ERASE command is entered by driving chip select (S#) LOW, followed by\nthe command code, and three address bytes on serial data input (DQ0). Any address in-\nside the sector is a valid address for the SECTOR ERASE command. S# must be driven\nLOW for the entire duration of the sequence.\nS# must be driven HIGH after the eighth bit of the last address byte has been latched in.\nOtherwise the SECTOR ERASE command is not executed. As soon as S# is driven HIGH,\nthe self-timed SECTOR ERASE cycle is initiated; the cycle\'s duration is t SE. While the\nSECTOR ERASE cycle is in progress, the status register may be read to check the value of\nthe write in progress (WIP) bit.

Af-\nter the WRITE ENABLE command has been decoded, the device sets the write enable\nlatch (WEL) bit.\nThe BULK ERASE command is entered by driving chip select (S#) LOW, followed by the\ncommand code on serial data input (DQ0). S# must be driven LOW for the entire dura-\ntion of the sequence.\nS# must be driven HIGH after the eighth bit of the command code has been latched in.\nOtherwise the BULK ERASE command is not executed. As soon as S# is driven HIGH,\nthe self-timed BULK ERASE cycle is initiated; the cycle\'s duration is t BE. While the BULK\nERASE cycle is in progress, the status register may be read to check the value of the write\nIn progress (WIP) bit. The WIP bit is 1 during the self-timed BULK ERASE cycle, and is 0\nwhen the cycle is completed. At some unspecified time before the cycle is completed,\nthe WEL bit is reset.\nThe BULK ERASE command is executed only if all block protect (BP2, BP1, BP0) bits are\n0. The BULK ERASE command is ignored if one or more sectors are protected.\nFigure 18: BULK ERASE Command Sequence\n7 0\nC\nMSBDQ0LSB\nCommandM25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nBULK ERASE\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nDEEP POWER-DOWN\nExecuting the DEEP POWER-DOWN command is the only way to put the device in the\nlowest power consumption mode, the DEEP POWER-DOWN mode. The DEEP POWER-\nDOWN command can also be used as a software protection mechanism while the de-\nvice is not in active use because in the DEEP POWER-DOWN mode the device ignores\nall WRITE, PROGRAM, and ERASE commands.\nDriving chip select (S#) HIGH deselects the device, and puts it in the STANDBY POWER\nmode if there is no internal cycle currently in progress. Once in STANDBY POWER\nmode, the DEEP POWER-DOWN mode can be entered by executing the DEEP POWER-\nDOWN command, subsequently reducing the standby current from I CC1 to I CC2.\nTo take the device out of DEEP POWER-DOWN mode, the RELEASE from DEEP POW-\nER-DOWN command must be issued. Other commands must not be issued while the\ndevice is in DEEP POWER-DOWN mode. The DEEP POWER-DOWN mode stops auto-\nmatically at power-down. The device always powers up in STANDBY POWER mode.\nThe DEEP POWER-DOWN command is entered by driving S# LOW, followed by the\ncommand code on serial data input (DQ0). S# must be driven LOW for the entire dura-\ntion of the sequence.\nS# must be driven HIGH after the eighth bit of the command code has been latched in.\nOtherwise the DEEP POWER-DOWN command is not executed. As soon as S# is driven\nHIGH, it requires a delay of t DP before the supply current is reduced to I CC2 and the\nDEEP POWER-DOWN mode is entered.\nAny DEEP POWER-DOWN command issued while an ERASE, PROGRAM, or WRITE cy-\ncle is in progress is rejected without any effect on the cycle that is in progress.\nFigure 19: DEEP POWER-DOWN Command Sequence\n7 0\nC\nMSBDQ0LSBtDP\nCommand\nDon’t CareDeep Power-Down Mode Standby ModeM25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nDEEP POWER-DOWN\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nRELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN\nOnce the device has entered DEEP POWER-DOWN mode, all commands are ignored ex-\ncept RELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN and READ ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE. Exe-\ncuting either of these commands takes the device out of the DEEP POWER-DOWN\nmode.\nThe RELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN command is entered by driving chip select\n(S#) LOW, followed by the command code on serial data input (DQ0). S# must be driven\nLOW for the entire duration of the sequence.\nThe RELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN command is terminated by driving S# HIGH.\nSending additional clock cycles on serial clock C while S# is driven LOW causes the\ncommand to be rejected and not executed.\nAfter S# has been driven HIGH, followed by a delay, t RES, the device is put in the STAND-\nBY mode. S# must remain HIGH at least until this period is over. The device waits to be\nselected so that it can receive, decode, and execute commands.\nAny RELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN command issued while an ERASE, PRO-\nGRAM, or WRITE cycle is in progress is rejected without any effect on the cycle that is in\nprogress.\nFigure 20: RELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN Command Sequence\nHigh-Z DQ17 0\nC\nMSBDQ0LSBtRDP\nCommand\nDon’t CareDeep Power-Down Mode Standby ModeM25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nRELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nREAD ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE\nOnce the device enters DEEP POWER-DOWN mode, all commands are ignored except\nREAD ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE and RELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN. Executing\neither of these commands takes the device out of the DEEP POWER-DOWN mode.\nThe READ ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE command is entered by driving chip select (S#)\nLOW, followed by the command code and three dummy bytes on serial data input\n(DQ0) . Each bit is latched in on the rising edge of serial clock C. The 8-bit electronic\nsignature is shifted out on serial data output DQ1 on the falling edge of C; S# must be\ndriven LOW the entire duration of the sequence for the electronic signature to be read.\nHowever, driving S# HIGH after the command code, but before the entire 8-bit electron-\nic signature has been output for the first time, still ensures that the device is put into\nSTANDBY mode.\nExcept while an ERASE, PROGRAM, or WRITE STATUS REGISTER cycle is in progress,\nthe READ ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE command provides access to the 8-bit electronic\nsignature of the device, and can be applied even if DEEP POWER-DOWN mode has not\nbeen entered. The READ ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE command is not executed while an\nERASE, PROGRAM, or WRITE STATUS REGISTER cycle is in progress and has no effect\non the cycle in progress.\nThe READ ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE command is terminated by driving S# high after\nthe electronic signature has been read at least once. Sending additional clock cycles C\nwhile S# is driven LOW causes the electronic signature to be output repeatedly.\nIf S# is driven HIGH, the device is put in STANDBY mode immediately unless it was pre-\nviously in DEEP POWER-DOWN mode. If previously in DEEP POWER-DOWN mode, the\ndevice transitions to STANDBY mode with delay as described here. Once in STANDBY\nmode, the device waits to be selected so that it can receive, decode, and execute instruc-\ntions.\n• If S# is driven HIGH before the electronic signature is read, transition to STANDBY\nmode is delayed by tRES1, as shown in the RELEASE from DEEP POWER-DOWN com-\nmand sequence. S# must remain HIGH for at least tRES1(max).\n• If S# is driven HIGH after the electronic signature is read, transition to STANDBY\nmode is delayed by tRES2. S# must remain HIGH for at least tRES2(max).\nFigure 21: READ ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE Command Sequence\n7 8 Cx0\nC\nMSBDQ0LSB\nCommand\nMSBLSB\nDQ1 High-Z\nDon’t CareDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUT\nDummy cyclesElectronic Signature \nDeep Power-Down StandbytRES2\nNote: 1.

The logic inside the device is held reset while V CC is\nless than the POR threshold voltage, V WI – all operations are disabled, and the device\ndoes not respond to any instruction. Moreover, the device ignores the following instruc-\ntions until a time delay of tPUW has elapsed after the moment that V CC rises above the\nVWI threshold:\n• WRITE ENABLE\n• PAGE PROGRAM\n• SECTOR ERASE\n• BULK ERASE\n• WRITE STATUS REGISTER\nHowever, the correct operation of the device is not guaranteed if, by this time, V CC is still\nbelow V CC.min . No WRITE STATUS REGISTER, PROGRAM, or ERASE instruction should\nbe sent until:\n•tPUW after V CC has passed the V WI threshold\n•tVSL after V CC has passed the V CC,min  level\nIf the time, tVSL, has elapsed, after V CC rises above V CC,min , the device can be selected\nfor READ instructions even if the tPUW delay has not yet fully elapsed.\nVPPH must be applied only when V CC is stable and in the V CC,min  to V CC,max  voltage\nrange.M25P32 Serial Flash Embedded Memory\nPower-Up/Down and Supply Line Decoupling\n09005aef84566541\nm25p32.pdf - Rev.
