A.2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe SGM2578A  is a single  load switch with reverse \ncurrent prot ection  function . The device can operate \nfrom 1V to 5.5V single supply and has the ability to \ndrive up to 2A continuous current . \nThe device contains a 30m Ω  l o w  R ON N-MOSFET  \ncontrolled by the ON pin. If the power supply is turned \non for the first time, a smart pull -down resistor is used \nto float the ON pin until the system is stable. Once the \nON pin reaches a high voltage (>  VIH), the pull -down \nresistor is disconnected, then the standby current is very low and power loss  can be reduced . The small package \nand low R\nON make the device very suitable for space \nlimited, battery powered applications.  \nThe device supports a wide input voltage range, which is suitable  for different voltage rails . The rise time is \nused to avoid inrush current. The SGM257 8A offers the \nquick output discharge function in disable status.  \nThe SGM 2578A  is available in a Green WLCSP-  \n0.9×0.9-4B-A package.

A \nlow o n-resistance N-MOSFET is integrated, which \nmakes a low  voltage drop across the device . To choose \nsuitable  rise tim e is alw ays used to avoid inrush \ncurrent.  \n \nControl Pin \nThe ON pin can control the device. Pullin g the ON pin \nhigh enables the device.  Logic high of  VIH (ON pin)  will \nenable the device  and VIL will turn off  it. It has the ability \nto interface with low -voltage GPIO. It can support  with \n1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V GPIO s. \n \nQuick Output Discharge  (QOD)  \nThe quick output discharge feature is available for \nSGM 2578 A. If the ON pin  is pulled low, a discharge \nresistor of 2 80Ω (TYP) is connected between VOUT \nand GND pins to prevent the output from floating when \nthe switch is disabled.  Functional Modes  \nThe connection of the VOUT pin is shown in Table 1. \nTable 2 shows the smart -ON functions.  \nTable 1. VOUT Connection  \nON Pin VOUT Pin  \nL GND \nH VIN \n \nTable 2.

It has a wide input range, \nwhich can be used in different end equipment to set \npower sequence, reduce inrush current and maintain \nlow standby leakage current.

Typical Application Circuit  Input Capacitor  \nA 1μF input capacitor (C IN) is recommended to use \nbetween VIN and GND close to the device pins.  It can \nlimit the voltage drop on the input supply. Larger C IN \ncan reduce voltage dip in high current applications.  \n \nOutput Capacitor  \nA 0.1μF output capacitor (C OUT) should be placed \nbetween VOUT and GND as close to the device pins  as \npossible. This capacitor will prevent parasitic board \ninductances from forcing V OUT below GND when the \nswitch is shutdown . To improve the VIN dropping when \nthe device is turned on, it is recommended that C IN is \nplaced greater than C OUT, due to the C IN is charge for \nCOUT. \n \n \n  \n 5.5V, 2A, 30mΩ RON Load Switch with \nSGM2578A  Reverse Current  Protection \n \n \n11 \nMARCH 2023  \n \nSG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  \nReverse Current Protectio n \nIf the ON pin is pulled low, the device is disabled, while \nVIN > 1V or V OUT > 1V  is met, the  reverse current \nprotection f unction is activated. This function prevents \nthe current flow ing from VOUT to VIN , and is very \nuseful when SGM2578 A is disabled and the output \nneeds  to be driven by another voltage source.  \nVOUTVSRC\nVIH\nVSRC - (IOUT × R ON)\nIOUTVFORCE\nIRC_VINRCP Disabled RCP Enabled\nDue to QOD\n0VVONVIN\n0V\nIVIN\n \nNOTES: V SRC is the input power supply to the equipment. \nVFORCE  is the external power source forced at VOUT pin. I VIN \nis the current of VIN pin. I OUT is output load current.  \nFigure 5. Reverse Current Protection  Figure 5 shows how the reverse current protection circuit \nis activated  in SGM2578A . Pulling the ON pin down, the \ndevice is shut down and an external volt age (VFORCE ) is \nforced to VOUT pin, the  reverse current is tested very \nsmall given by I RC_VIN . This will prevent any large  extra \ncurrent reverse f rom the V FORCE  (added on V OUT) to V IN. \n \nPower Supply Recommendations  \nThe SGM2578 A is design ed for a wide operate input \nvoltage  range of 1V to 5.5V. Place a  1μF input bypass \ncapacitor close to the device pins  is recommended.  \n \nPower Supply Sequencing without a GPIO \nInput  \nIn many terminal devices, each module needs to be \npowered up in a pre- determined manner . SGM2578 A \ncan set a power sequenc e by the t DELAY  without extra \nGPIO, and may reduce inrush current. Figure 6 shows \nthe sequence that the ON pin of first load switch is \nconnected to the VIN, and the second load switch ON \npin is connected to the VOUT of first load switch. The \nsecond load switch is powered up when the first load switch is turned on, this is the fixed sequence and the delay time set by default t\nDELAY . \n \n \nSGM2578AModule 1\nModule 2\nSGM2578ACIN COU T1\nCOU T2VIN VOUT\nON GND\nVINVOUT ON\nGNDPower Supply\n \nFigure 6.
