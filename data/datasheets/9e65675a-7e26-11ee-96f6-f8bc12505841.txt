Inductance measured at 100kHz, 100mVrms.\n2. Inductance at Irated is the value of the inductance at 25°C at the listed rated current.  \n3. The rated current as listed is either the saturation current (25°C or 100°C) or the heating current depending on \nwhich value is lower.   \n4. The nominal DCR is measured from point  a  to point  b , as shown below on the mechanical drawing. \n5. The saturation current is the typical current which causes the inductance to drop by 20% at the stated ambient \ntemperatures (25°C, 100°C ). This current is determined by placing the component in the specified ambient envi -\nronment and applying a short duration pulse current  \n(to eliminate self-heating effects) to the component.\n6. The heating current is the DC current which causes the part temperature  \nto increase by approximately 40°C when used in a typical application.  7. In high volt*time applications, additional heating in the component can occur due to core losses in the inductor \nwhich may neccessitate derating the current in order to limit the temperature rise of the component. To deter -\nmine the approximate total losses (or temperature rise) for a given application, the coreloss and temperature \nrise curves can be used.\n8. Parts with the HLT suffix are sold in tape and reel packaging. Pulse complies to industry standard tape and reel \nspecification EIA-481.  \nThe tape and reel for this product has a width (W=24mm), pitch (Po=16mm) and depth (Ko=10.5mm). Samples of \nthese parts can be ordered by removing the HLT suffix and replacing with HL. \n9. The temperature of the component (ambient plus temperature rise) must be within the stated operating tem -\nperature range.\nMechanical Schematic\nDimensions:   \n \nUnless otherwise specified, \nall tolerances are ± \n                              Weight   . . . . . . . . . . 2 .74/grams\nTape & Reel   . . . . . . . . 300/reelPA4390.XXXHLT\nmm\n0,25Part \nNumberInductance1\n@ 0A DC\n(nH +/- 15%)Inductance2\n@Irated\n(nH TYP)Irated 3\n(ADC)DCR 4\n(mΩ nominal )Heating Current6\n(A TYP)25°C 100°C 125°C\nPA4390.101HLT 100 100 68\n0.185+/-10%113 86 81\n68PA4390.121HLT 120 120 68 94 81 78\nPA4390.151HLT 150 150 68 80 75 73\nPA4390.331HLT 330 310 33 43 33 31Saturation Current 5\n(A TYP)\nP765.D (06/16)2pulseelectronics.comSMT Power Inductors\nPower Beads - PA4390.XXXHLT SeriesPulse Ja ck\nE l e c t r o n i c s\n050100150200250300350400\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Inductance (nH)\nCurrent (A)PA4390.XXXHL, LvsI, 25 °C\n.101HL_25°C .121HL_25°C .151HL_25°C .331HL_25°C\n050100150200250300350400\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Inductance (nH)\nCurrent (A)PA4390.XXXHL, LvsI, 100 °C\n_101HL_100°C .121HL_100°C .151HL_100°C .331HL_100°C\n050100150200250300350400\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Inductance (nH)\nCurrent (A)PA4390.XXXHL, LvsI, 125 °C\n_101HL_125°C .121HL_125°C .151HL_125°C .331HL_125°C\nP765.D (06/16)3pulseelectronics.comSMT Power Inductors\nPower Beads - PA4390.XXXHLT SeriesPulse Ja ck\nE l e c t r o n i c s\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6\n0 500 10001 500 2000 2500 3000CoreLoss (W )\nDeltaB\nwhere DeltaB = .34 * L(nH) * DeltaI PA4390.XXXHL T CoreLoss (W )\n200kH z 300kHz 400kHz 500kHz 600kHz 700kHz 1.0MHz\n0102030405060\n00 .2 0.40 .6 0.81 1.2Temp Rise abov e Ambient (C) \nPower (W)\nTotal Po wer Dissipation (W) = CopperLoss + CoreLos s\nCopperLoss = Irms^2 * Rdc(mOhms) / 100 0\nCoreLoss = (from table)PA4390.XXXH L Temp Rise vs Power Dissipation \nFor More Information\nPulse Worldwide\nHeadquarters\n12220 World Trade Drive\nSan Diego, CA 92128\nU.S.A.\nTel: 858 674 8100\nFax: 858 674 8262Pulse Europe\nPulse Electronics GmbH\nAm Rottland 12\n58540 Meinerzhagen\nGermany\nTel: 49 2354 777 100\nFax: 49 2354 777 168Pulse China Headquarters\nB402, Shenzhen Academy of\nAerospace Technology Bldg.\n10th Kejinan Road\nHigh-Tech Zone\nNanshan District\nShenzhen, PR China 518057\nTel: 86 755 33966678 \nFax: 86 755 33966700Pulse North China\nRoom 2704/2705\nSuper Ocean Finance Ctr.\n2067 Yan An Road West\nShanghai 200336\nChina\nTel: 86 21 62787060 \nFax: 86 2162786973Pulse South Asia\n135 Joo Seng Road\n#03-02\nPM Industrial Bldg.\nSingapore 368363\nTel: 65 6287 8998  \nFax: 65 6287 8998Pulse North Asia\n3F, No. 198\nZhongyuan Road\nZhongli City\nTaoyuan County 320\nTaiwan R.
