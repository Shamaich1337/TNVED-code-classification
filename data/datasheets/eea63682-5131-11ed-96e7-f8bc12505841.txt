The \nlow dropout voltage and low quiescent current of \nthe TPS715 allows operation at extremely low power \nlevels. Thus, the TPS715 is designed for battery-\npowered applications and as a power-management \nattachment to low-power microcontrollers.\nThe TPS715 is available in both fixed and adjustable \nversions. For more flexibility or higher output voltages, \nthe adjustable version uses feedback resistors to set \nthe output voltage from 1.205 V to 15 V. The TPS715 \nLDOs support a low dropout of typically 415 mV at \n50 mA of load current. The low quiescent current \n(3.2 μA typically) is stable over the entire range of \noutput load current (0 mA to 50 mA). The TPS715 \nalso features an internal soft-start to lower the inrush \ncurrent. The built-in overcurrent limit helps protect the \nregulator in the event of a load short or fault.\nPackage Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS715 SC70 (5) 2.00 mm × 1.25 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\n \n \nTPS716\nIN OUT\nGNDMCULi-Ion \nBattery\nTypical Application SchematicTPS715\nSLVS338S  – MAY 2001 – REVISED AUGUST 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The low quiescent current across the complete load current range, makes the TPS715 \ndesigned for powering battery-operated applications. The TPS715 family has internal soft-start to control inrush \ncurrent into the output capacitor. These LDOs also have overcurrent protection during a load-short or fault \ncondition on the output.\n6.2 Functional Block Diagrams\nBandgap\nReferenceCurrent\nSenseLeakage Null\nControl Circuit\nGND\n+–ILIM\nVREF = 1.205 VGNDR1 R2\nGNDV(IN) V(OUT)\nFBGND\nFigure 6-1.

I RATED  is the maximum I OUT listed in the Recommended \nOperating Conditions  table. In dropout operation, the pass transistor is in the ohmic or triode region of operation, \nand acts as a switch. The dropout voltage indirectly specifies a minimum input voltage greater than the nominal \nprogrammed output voltage at which the output voltage is expected to stay in regulation. If the input voltage falls \nto less than the value required to maintain output regulation, then the output voltage falls as well.\nFor a CMOS regulator, the dropout voltage is determined by the drain-source, on-state resistance (R DS(ON) ) of \nthe pass transistor. Therefore, if the linear regulator operates at less than the rated current, the dropout voltage \nfor that current scales accordingly. Use Equation 1  to calculate the R DS(ON)  of the device.\n(1)\n6.3.4 Current Limit\nThe device has an internal current limit circuit that protects the regulator during transient high-load current faults \nor shorting events. The current limit is a brick-wall scheme. In a high-load current fault, the brick-wall scheme \nlimits the output current to the current limit (I CL). ICL is listed in the Electrical Characteristics  table.\nThe output voltage is not regulated when the device is in current limit. When a current limit event occurs, the \ndevice begins to heat up because of the increase in power dissipation. When the device is in brick-wall current \nlimit, the pass transistor dissipates power [(V IN – V OUT) × I CL]. If thermal shutdown is triggered, the device \nturns off. After the device cools down, the internal thermal shutdown circuit turns the device back on. If the \noutput current fault condition continues, the device cycles between current limit and thermal shutdown. For more \ninformation on current limits, see the Know Your Limits  application report .\nFigure 6-3  shows a diagram of the current limit.\nVOUT(NOM)\n0 V\n0 mAVOUT\nICL IRATEDIOUTBrickwall\nFigure 6-3.

Device Functional Mode Comparison\nOPERATING MODEPARAMETER\nVIN IOUT\nNormal VIN > V OUT(nom)  + V DO IOUT < ICL\nDropout VIN < V OUT(nom)  + V DO IOUT < ICL\n6.4.1 Normal Operation\nThe device regulates to the nominal output voltage under the following conditions:\n•The input voltage is greater than the nominal output voltage plus the dropout voltage (V OUT(nom)  + V DO)\n•The output current is less than the current limit (I OUT < ICL)\n•The device junction temperature is less than 125°C\n6.4.2 Dropout Operation\nIf the input voltage is lower than the nominal output voltage plus the specified dropout voltage, but all other \nconditions are met for normal operation, the device operates in dropout mode. In this mode, the output voltage \ntracks the input voltage. During this mode, the transient performance of the device becomes significantly \ndegraded because the pass transistor is in the ohmic or triode region, and acts as a switch. Line or load \ntransients in dropout can result in large output-voltage deviations.\nWhen the device is in a steady dropout state (defined as when the device is in dropout, V IN < V OUT(NOM)  + V DO, \ndirectly after being in a normal regulation state, but not during start up), the pass transistor is driven into the \nohmic or triode region. When the input voltage returns to a value greater than or equal to the nominal output \nvoltage plus the dropout voltage (V OUT(NOM)  + V DO), the output voltage can overshoot for a short period of time \nwhile the device pulls the pass transistor back into the linear region.TPS715\nSLVS338S – MAY 2001 – REVISED AUGUST 2022 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS715\n7 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n7.1 Application Information\nThe TPS715 family of LDO regulators is a good choice for battery powered applications as well as a good \nattachment to low power micro-controllers such as MSP430 , due to its low IQ performance across load current \nrange. The ultra-low-supply current of the TPS715 device maximizes efficiency at light loads, its high input \nvoltage range makes and flexibility of output voltage selection in adjustable configuration and fixed output levels \nmakes the device suitable for supplies such as unconditioned solar panels.\n7.2 Typical Application\nTPS71533\nIN OUTVIN VOUT\nC1\n0.1/c109F0.47 /c109FGND\nFigure 7-1.

TPS71501 Adjustable LDO Regulator Programming\n7.2.1 Detailed Design Procedure\n7.2.1.1 Setting V OUT for the TPS71501 Adjustable LDO\nThe TPS715 family contains an adjustable version, the TPS71501, which sets the output voltage using an \nexternal resistor divider as shown in Figure 7-2 . The output voltage operating range is 1.2 V to 15 V, and is \ncalculated using:\nOUT REFR1V V 1R2/c230 /c246/c61 /c180 /c43 /c231 /c247/c232 /c248\n(2)\nwhere:\n•VREF = 1.205 V (typical)www.ti.comTPS715\nSLVS338S – MAY 2001 – REVISED AUGUST 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS715\nChoose resistors R1 and R2 allows approximately 1.5 μA of current through the resistor divider. Lower value \nresistors can be used for improved noise performance, but consume more power. Avoid higher resistor values \nbecause leakage current into or out of FB across R1 / R2 creates an offset voltage that is proportional to V OUT \ndivided by V REF. The recommended design procedure is to choose R2 = 1 \u2009MΩ to set the divider current at \n1.5 μA, and then calculate R1 using Equation 3 :\nR 1\xa0 = \xa0V O U T\nV RE F\xa0 − \xa01 × R 2 (3)\nFigure 7-2  depicts this configuration.\n7.2.1.2 External Capacitor Requirements\nThe device is designed to be stable using low equivalent series resistance (ESR) ceramic capacitors at the input \nand output. Multilayer ceramic capacitors have become the industry standard for these types of applications and \nare recommended, but must be used with good judgment. Ceramic capacitors that employ X7R-, X5R-, and \nC0G-rated dielectric materials provide relatively good capacitive stability across temperature, whereas the use of \nY5V-rated capacitors is discouraged because of large variations in capacitance.\nRegardless of the ceramic capacitor type selected, the effective capacitance varies with operating voltage and \ntemperature. As a rule of thumb, expect the effective capacitance to decrease by as much as 50%. The input \nand output capacitors recommended in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table account for an effective \ncapacitance of approximately 50% of the nominal value.\n7.2.1.3 Input and Output Capacitor Requirements\nAlthough an input capacitor is not required for stability, good analog design practice is to connect a capacitor \nfrom IN to GND. This capacitor counteracts reactive input sources and improves transient response, input ripple, \nand PSRR. An input capacitor is recommended if the source impedance is more than 0.5 Ω. A higher value \ncapacitor may be necessary if large, fast rise-time load or line transients are anticipated or if the device is \nlocated several inches from the input power source.\nDynamic performance of the device is improved with the use of an output capacitor. Use an output capacitor \nwithin the range specified in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table for stability.\n7.2.1.4 Reverse Current\nExcessive reverse current can damage this device. Reverse current flows through the intrinsic body diode of the \nPMOS pass transistor instead of the normal conducting channel. At high magnitudes, this current flow degrades \nthe long-term reliability of the device.\nConditions where reverse current can occur are outlined in this section, all of which can exceed the absolute \nmaximum rating of V OUT ≤ V IN + 0.3 V. These conditions are:\n•If the device has a large C OUT and the input supply collapses with little or no load current\n•The output is biased when the input supply is not established\n•The output is biased above the input supply\nIf reverse current flow is expected in the application, external protection is recommended to protect the device. \nReverse current is not limited in the device, so external limiting is required if extended reverse voltage operation \nis anticipated.TPS715\nSLVS338S – MAY 2001 – REVISED AUGUST 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS715\nFigure 7-3  shows one approach for protecting the device.\nIN OUT\nGNDCIN\nGND\nGNDCOUT\nGNDInternal Body DiodeSchottky Diode\nFigure 7-3. Example Circuit for Reverse Current Protection Using a Schottky Diode\n7.2.1.5 Feed-Forward Capacitor (C FF)\nFor the adjustable-voltage version device, a feed-forward capacitor (C FF) can be connected from the OUT pin \nto the FB pin. C FF improves transient, noise, and PSRR performance, but is not required for regulator stability. \nRecommended C FF values are listed in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table. A higher capacitance \nCFF can be used; however, the start-up time increases. For a detailed description of C FF tradeoffs, see the Pros \nand Cons of Using a Feedforward Capacitor with a Low-Dropout Regulator  application note.\nCFF and R 1 form a zero in the loop gain at frequency f Z, while C FF, R1, and R 2 form a pole in the loop gain at \nfrequency f P. CFF zero and pole frequencies can be calculated from the following equations:\nfZ = 1 / (2 × π × C FF × R 1) (4)\nfP = 1 / (2 × π × C FF × (R 1 || R 2)) (5)\nCFF ≥ 10 pF is required for stability if the feedback divider current is less than 5 μA. Equation 6  calculates the \nfeedback divider current.\nIFB_Divider  = V OUT / (R 1 + R 2) (6)\nTo avoid start-up time increases from C FF, limit the product C FF × R 1 < 50 µs.\nFor an output voltage of 1.205 V with the FB pin tied to the OUT pin, no C FF is used.\n7.2.1.6 Power Dissipation (P D)\nCircuit reliability requires consideration of the device power dissipation, location of the circuit on the printed \ncircuit board (PCB), and correct sizing of the thermal plane. The PCB area around the regulator must have few \nor no other heat-generating devices that cause added thermal stress.\nTo first-order approximation, power dissipation in the regulator depends on the input-to-output voltage difference \nand load conditions. The following equation calculates power dissipation (P D).\nPD = (V IN – V OUT) × I OUT (7)\nNote\nPower dissipation can be minimized, and therefore greater efficiency can be achieved, by correct \nselection of the system voltage rails. For the lowest power dissipation, use the minimum input voltage \nrequired for correct output regulation.\nFor devices with a thermal pad, the primary heat conduction path for the device package is through the thermal \npad to the PCB. Solder the thermal pad to a copper pad area under the device. This pad area must contain an \narray of plated vias that conduct heat to additional copper planes for increased heat dissipation.www.ti.comTPS715\nSLVS338S – MAY 2001 – REVISED AUGUST 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS715\nThe maximum power dissipation determines the maximum allowable ambient temperature (T A) for the device. \nAccording to the following equation, power dissipation and junction temperature are most often related by the \njunction-to-ambient thermal resistance (R θJA) of the combined PCB and device package and the temperature of \nthe ambient air (T A).\nTJ = T A + (R θJA × P D) (8)\nThermal resistance (R θJA) is highly dependent on the heat-spreading capability built into the particular PCB \ndesign, and therefore varies according to the total copper area, copper weight, and location of the planes. \nThe junction-to-ambient thermal resistance listed in the Thermal Information  table is determined by the JEDEC \nstandard PCB and copper-spreading area, and is used as a relative measure of package thermal performance.\n7.2.1.7 Estimating Junction Temperature\nThe JEDEC standard now recommends the use of psi ( Ψ) thermal metrics to estimate the junction temperatures \nof the linear regulator when in-circuit on a typical PCB board application. These metrics are not thermal \nresistance parameters and instead offer a practical and relative way to estimate junction temperature. These \npsi metrics are determined to be significantly independent of the copper area available for heat-spreading. \nThe Thermal Information  table lists the primary thermal metrics, which are the junction-to-top characterization \nparameter (ψ JT) and junction-to-board characterization parameter ( ψJB). These parameters provide two methods \nfor calculating the junction temperature (T J), as described in the following equations. Use the junction-to-top \ncharacterization parameter ( ψJT) with the temperature at the center-top of device package (T T) to calculate \nthe junction temperature. Use the junction-to-board characterization parameter ( ψJB) with the PCB surface \ntemperature 1 mm from the device package (T B) to calculate the junction temperature.\nTJ = T T + ψ JT × P D (9)\nwhere:\n•PD is the dissipated power\n•TT is the temperature at the center-top of the device package\nTJ = T B + ψ JB × P D (10)\nwhere:\n•TB is the PCB surface temperature measured 1 mm from the device package and centered on the package \nedge\nFor detailed information on the thermal metrics and how to use them, see the Semiconductor and IC Package \nThermal Metrics  application note .TPS715\nSLVS338S – MAY 2001 – REVISED AUGUST 2022 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS715\n7.2.2 Application Curves\n1816 1412VIN\nVOUTVOUT= 3.3 V\nRL= 66 /c87\nCOUT= 10 F /c1098\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nt − Time − ms2 0 6 4 10 8 20VOUT− Output Voltage − V\nVIN− Input Voltage − V\n \nFigure 7-4.

The input \nvoltage range provides adequate headroom in order for the device to have a regulated output. This input supply \nmust be well regulated. If the input supply is noisy, additional input capacitors with low ESR can help improve the \noutput noise performance.\n7.5 Layout\n7.5.1 Layout Guidelines\nFor best overall performance, place all circuit components on the same side of the printed-circuit-board and \nas near as practical to the respective LDO pin connections. Place ground return connections for the input \nand output capacitors as close to the GND pin as possible, using wide, component-side, copper planes. Do \nnot use vias and long traces to create LDO circuit connections to the input capacitor, output capacitor, or the \nresistor divider because this practice negatively affects system performance. This grounding and layout scheme \nminimizes inductive parasitics, and thereby reduces load-current transients, minimizes noise, and increases \ncircuit stability. A ground reference plane is also recommended and is either embedded in the PCB itself or \nlocated on the bottom side of the PCB opposite the components. This reference plane serves to assure accuracy \nof the output voltage and shield the LDO from noise.\n7.5.1.1 Power Dissipation\nTo ensure reliable operation, worst-case junction temperature must not exceed 125°C. This restriction limits the \npower dissipation the regulator can handle in any given application. To ensure the junction temperature is within \nacceptable limits, calculate the maximum allowable dissipation, P D(max) , and the actual dissipation, P D, which \nmust be less than or equal to P D(max) .TPS715\nSLVS338S – MAY 2001 – REVISED AUGUST 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS715\nThe maximum-power-dissipation limit is determined using Equation 11 :\nJ A\nD(max)\nJAT max TPR/c113/c45/c61\n(11)\nwhere\n•TJmax is the maximum allowable junction temperature\n•RθJA is the thermal resistance junction-to-ambient for the package (see the Thermal Information table)\n•TA is the ambient temperature\nThe regulator dissipation is calculated using Equation 12 :\nD IN OUT OUTP (V V ) I/c61 /c45 /c180\n(12)\nFor a higher power package version of the TPS715, see the TPS715A .\n7.5.2 Layout Example\nIN OUTGND FB NC\nVIN\nGNDVOUTGND\nCIN\nCOUTR1R2\nTPS71501DCK\nFigure 7-11.
