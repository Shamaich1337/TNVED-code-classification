The combination of dc precision, low noise, and \nfast settling time results in superior accuracy in medical instruments, electronic measurement, and automated test equipment. Unlike many competitive amplifiers, the AD8510/ AD8512/AD8513 maintain their fast settling performance even \nwith substantial capacitive loads. Unlike many older JFET \namplifiers, the AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 do not suffer from output phase reversal when input voltages exceed the maximum \ncommon-mode voltage range. Fast slew rate and great stability with capacitive loads make the \nAD8510/AD8512/AD8513 a perfect fit for high performance filters. Low input bias currents, low offset, and low noise result in a wide dynamic range of photodiode amplifier circuits. Low \nnoise and distortion, high output current, and excellent speed \nmake the AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 great choices for audio \napplications.  \nThe AD8510/AD8512 are both available in 8-lead narrow SOIC_N \nand 8-lead MSOP packages. MSOP-packaged devices are only available in tape and reel. The AD8513 is available in 14-lead \nSOIC_N and TSSOP packages.  \nThe AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 are specified over the −40°C to \n+125°C extended industrial temperature range. \nAD8510/AD8512/AD8513 Date Sheet\n \nRev.

K | Page 14 of 21 GENERAL APPLICATION INFORMATION \nINPUT OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION \nThe AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 have internal protective \ncircuitry that allows voltages as high as 0.7 V beyond the \nsupplies to be applied at the input of either terminal without causing damage. For higher input voltages, a series resistor is \nnecessary to limit the input current. The resistor value can be \ndetermined from the formula \nmA 5\uf0a3\uf02d\nSS IN\nRV V \nWith a very low offset current of <0.5 nA up to 125°C, higher \nresistor values can be used in series with the inputs. A 5 kΩ resistor protects the inputs from voltages as high as 25 V beyond the supplies and adds less than 10 μV to the offset. \nOUTPUT PHASE REVERSAL  \nPhase reversal is a change of polarity in the transfer function of \nthe amplifier. This can occur when the voltage applied at the \ninput of an amplifier exceeds the maximum common-mode \nvoltage. \nPhase reversal can cause permanent damage to the device and \ncan result in system lockups. The AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 do not exhibit phase reversal when input voltages are beyond the \nsupplies. \nTIME (20µs/DIV)\n02729-057VOLTAGE (2V/DIV)VINVOUTVSY = ±5V\nAV = 1\nRL = 10kΩ\n \nFigure 40.

THD + N vs. Frequency \nTOTAL NOISE INCLUDING SOURCE RESISTORS \nThe low input current noise and input bias current of the \nAD8510/AD8512/AD8513 make them the ideal amplifiers for \ncircuits with substantial input source resistance. Input offset \nvoltage increases by less than 15 nV per 500 Ω of source resistance at room temperature.

The current noise \nof the AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 is so low that its total density does not become a significant term unless R\nS is greater than \n165 MΩ, an impractical value for most applications. \nThe total equivalent rms noise over a specific bandwidth is \nexpressed as \nBW e enTOTAL nTOTAL\uf03d  \nwhere BW is the bandwidth in hertz. \nNote that the previous analysis is valid for frequencies larger \nthan 150 Hz and assumes flat noise above 10 kHz. For lower \nfrequencies, flicker noise (1/f) must be considered. \n \nDate Sheet AD8510/AD8512/AD8513\n \nRev. K | Page 15 of 21 SETTLING TIME \nSettling time is the time it takes the output of the amplifier to \nreach and remain within a percentage of its final value after a \npulse is applied at the input. The AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 settle to within 0.01% in less than 900 ns with a step of 0 V to \n10 V in unity gain. This makes each of these devices an excellent \nchoice as a buffer at the output of DACs whose settling time is \ntypically less than 1 μs. \nIn addition to the fast settling time and fast slew rate, low offset \nvoltage drift and input offset current maintain the full accuracy  \nof 12-bit converters over the entire operating temperature range. \nOVERLOAD RECOVERY TIME \nOverload recovery, also known as overdrive recovery, is the \ntime it takes the output of an amplifier to recover to its linear \nregion from a saturated condition. This recovery time is par-ticularly important in applications where the amplifier must amplify small signals in the presence of large transient voltages. \nFigure 42 shows the positive overload recovery of the AD8510/ \nAD8512/AD8513.

Each device \nis capable of driving a capacitive load of up to 1000 pF without \noscillation in unity gain using the worst case configuration.  \nHowever, as with most amplifiers, driving larger capacitive \nloads in a unity-gain configuration can cause excessive overshoot and ringing, or even oscillation. A simple snubber network significantly reduces the amount of overshoot and ringing. The advantage of this configuration is that the output \nswing of the amplifier is not reduced, because R\nS is outside the \nfeedback loop. \n7\n46 AD8510\n200mV RS\nCS CLVOUTV+\nV–\n02729-0552\n3\n \nFigure 44.

One \nof the most popular uses is in the design of regulated power \nsupplies, where a rectifier circuit is used to convert an input \nsinusoid to a unipolar output voltage.  \nHowever, there are some potential problems with amplifiers \nused in this manner. When the input voltage (V IN) is negative, \nthe output is zero, and the magnitude of V IN is doubled at the \ninputs of the op amp. If this voltage exceeds the power supply voltage, it can permanently damage some amplifiers. In addition, the op amp must come out of saturation when V\nIN is negative. \nThis delays the output signal because the amplifier requires \ntime to enter its linear region. \nAlthough the AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 have a very fast \noverdrive recovery time, which makes them great choices for the \nrectification of transient signals, the symmetry of the positive and negative recovery times is also important to keep the output \nsignal undistorted.  \nFigure 49 shows the test circuit of the rectifier. The first stage of \nthe circuit is a half-wave rectifier. When the sine wave applied at the input is positive, the output follows the input response. \nDuring the negative cycle of the input, the output tries to swing \nnegative to follow the input, but the power supply restrains it to zero. In a similar fashion, the second stage is a follower during the positive cycle of the sine wave and an inverter during the \nnegative cycle. \n8\n4 2131/2\nAD85124\n8 5762/2\nAD8512R2\n10kΩR3\n10kΩ\nR1\n1kΩ\nOUT A\n(HALF WAVE)OUT B\n(FULL WAVE)10V\n10VVIN\n3V p-p\n02729-045 \nFigure 49.

K | Page 18 of 21 I-V CONVERSION APPLICATIONS \nPhotodiode Circuits \nCommon applications for I-V conversion include photodiode \ncircuits where the amplifier is used to convert a current emitted \nby a diode placed at the positive input terminal into an output \nvoltage. \nThe AD8510/AD8512/AD8513’s low input bias current, wide \nbandwidth, and low noise make them each an excellent choice for various photodiode applications, including fax machines, fiber optic controls, motion sensors, and bar code readers. \nThe circuit shown in Figure 52 uses a silicon diode with zero \nbias voltage. This is known as a photovoltaic mode; this \nconfiguration limits the overall noise and is suitable for \ninstrumentation applications. \n4\n7362\nAD8510Cf\nR2\nRd CtVEE\nVCC\n02729-048 \nFigure 52. Equivalent Preamplifier Photodiode Circuit \nA larger signal bandwidth can be attained at the expense of \nadditional output noise. The total input capacitance (Ct) consists of the sum of the diode capacitance (typically 3 pF to 4 pF) and the amplifier’s input capacitance (12 pF), which \nincludes external parasitic capacitance. Ct creates a pole in the \nfrequency response that can lead to an unstable system. To ensure stability and optimize the bandwidth of the signal, a capacitor is placed in the feedback loop of the circuit shown in Figure 52. It creates a zero and yields a bandwidth whose corner frequency is 1/(2π(R2Cf)).  \nThe value of R2 can be determined by the ratio  \nV/I\nD \nwhere:  \nV is the desired output voltage of the op amp. \nID is the diode current.  \nFor example, if I D is 100 μA and a 10 V output voltage is desired, \nR2 can be 100 kΩ. Rd (see Figure 52) is a junction resistance \nthat drops typically by a factor of 2 for every 10°C increase in \ntemperature.  A typical value for Rd is 1000 MΩ. Because Rd >> R2, the \ncircuit behavior is not impacted by the effect of the junction \nresistance. The maximum signal bandwidth is \nCt RftfMAX2 2\uf070\uf03d  \nwhere ft is the unity-gain frequency of the amplifier. \nCf can be calculated by \nft RCtCf2 2\uf070\uf03d  \nwhere ft is the unity-gain frequency of the op amp, and it achieves \na phase margin, φ M, of approximately 45°. \nA higher phase margin can be obtained by increasing the value \nof Cf. Setting Cf to twice the previous value yields approximately φ\nM = 65° and a maximal flat frequency response, but it reduces the \nmaximum signal bandwidth by 50%. \nUsing the previous parameters with a Cf  ≈ 1 pF, the signal \nbandwidth is approximately 2.6 MHz. \nSignal Transmission Applications \nOne popular signal transmission method uses pulse-width \nmodulation. High data rates can require a fast comparator \nrather than an op amp. However, the need for sharp, undistorted \nsignals can favor using a linear amplifier. \nThe AD8510/AD8512/AD8513 make excellent voltage \ncomparators. In addition to a high slew rate, the AD8510/ \nAD8512/AD8513 have a very fast saturation recovery time. In \nthe absence of feedback, the amplifiers are in open-loop mode (very high gain). In this mode of operation, they spend much of \ntheir time in saturation. \nThe circuit shown in Figure 53 was used to compare two signals \nof different frequencies, namely a 100 Hz sine wave and a 1 kHz triangular wave. Figure 54 shows a scope plot of the resulting \noutput waveforms. A pull-up resistor (typically 5 kΩ) can be \nconnected from the output to V\nCC if the output voltage needs to \nreach the positive rail. The trade-off is that power consumption \nis higher. \nVOUT\nV1\nV242673\n–15V+15V\n02729-049 \nFigure 53. Pulse-Width Modulator \nDate Sheet AD8510/AD8512/AD8513\n \nRev.

Channel Separation The AD8510 single has two additional active terminals that are \nnot present on the AD8512 dual or AD8513 quad devices. These pins are labeled null and are used for fine adjustment of the input offset voltage. Although the guaranteed maximum offset \nvoltage at room temperature is 400 μV and over the −40°C to \n+125°C range is 800 mV maximum, this offset voltage can be reduced by adding a potentiometer to the null pins as shown in Figure 57. With the 20 kΩ potentiometer shown, the adjustment range is approximately ±3.5 mV . The potentiometer parallels \nlow value resistors in the drain circuit of the JFET differential \ninput pair and allows unbalancing of the drain currents to change the offset voltage. If offset adjustment is not required, \nthese pins must be left unconnected.  \nCaution must be used when adding adjusting potentiometers to \nany op amp with this capability for several reasons. First, there is gain from these nodes to the output; therefore, capacitive coupling from noisy traces to these nodes injects noise into the signal \npath. Second, the temperature coefficient of the potentiometer \ndoes not match the temperature coefficient of the internal resistors, so the offset voltage drift with temperature is slightly affected. Third, this provision is for adjusting the offset voltage of the op amp, not for adjusting the offset of the overall system. Although \nit is tempting to decrease the value of the potentiometer to attain \nmore range, this adversely affects the dc and ac parameters.
