This is 1kVDC for 1 second.A question commonly asked is, “What is the continuous voltage that can be applied across the part in normal operation?”For a part holding no specific agency approvals, such as the NTE series, both input and output should normally be maintained within SELV limits i.e. less than 42.4V peak, or \n60VDC. The isolation test voltage represents a measure of immunity to transient voltages and the part should never be used as an element of a safety isolation system. The part could be expected to function correctly with several hundred volts offset applied continuously across the isolation barrier; but then the circuitry on both sides of the barrier must be regarded as operating at an unsafe voltage and further isolation/insulation systems must form a barrier between these circuits and any user-accessible circuitry according to safety standard requirements. \nREPEATED HIGH-VOLTAGE ISOLATION TESTING\nIt is well known that repeated high-voltage isolation testing of a barrier component can actually degrade isolation capability, to a lesser or greater degree depending on materials, construction and environment. The NTE series has toroidal isolation transformers, with no additional insulation between primary and secondary windings of enameled wire.  While   parts can be expected to withstand several times the stated test voltage, the isolation capability does depend on the wire insulation. Any material, including this enamel (typically polyurethane) is susceptible to eventual chemical degradation when subject to very high applied voltages thus implying that the number of tests should be strictly limited. We therefore strongly advise against repeated high voltage isolation testing, but if it is absolutely required, that the voltage be reduced by 20% from specified test voltage.\nThis consideration equally applies to agency recognized parts rated for better than functional isolation where the wire enamel insulation is always supplemented by a further \ninsulation system of physical spacing or barriers. \n1. 12V input types have typically 3% less load regulation change.TEMPERATURE DERATING GRAPH\n150 100 50 0 -4000.51.01.5\nSafe Operating Area85°C\nAmbient Temperature (°C)Output Power (W)\nNTE Series\nIsolated 1W Single Output SM DC/DC ConvertersKDC_NTE.K03 Page 3 of 6\nwww.murata-ps.com/supportTOLERANCE ENVELOPES\n3.3V output types.
