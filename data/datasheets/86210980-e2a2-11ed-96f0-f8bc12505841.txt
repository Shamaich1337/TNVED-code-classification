It \noffers desirable characteristics for board level protection \nincluding fast response time, low operating and clamping \nvoltage, and no device degradation.\nThe unique design incorporates surge rated, low \ncapacitance steering diodes and a TVS diode in a single \npackage.  During transient conditions, the steering diodes \ndirect the transient current to ground via the internal low \nvoltage TVS.  The TVS diode clamps the transient voltage \nto a safe level.  The low capacitance array configuration \nallows the user to protect up to four data lines.\nThe SRDA3.3-4 is constructed using Semtech’s proprietary \nEPD process technology.  The EPD process provides low \nstand-off voltages with significant reductions in leakage \ncurrent and capacitance over silicon avalanche diode \nprocesses.  They feature a true operating voltage of 3.3 \nvolts for superior protection.  These devices are in a 8-pin \nSOIC package.  It measures 3.9 x 4.9mm.  The high surge \ncapability (IPP=25A, tp=8/20μs) means it can be used in \nhigh threat environments in applications such as CO/CPE \nequipment, telecommunication lines, and video lines.\nI/O1\n5,82,3\nI/O2 I/O3 I/O41\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5I/O 1\nI/O 2I/O 3I/O 4 NC\nNCGND\nGND\n\nSRDA3.3-4\nFinal Datasheet   Rev 3.1\n11/01/2018\nwww.semtech.com2 \nSemtech\nProprietary & ConfidentialAbsolute Maximum Ratings\nElectrical Characteristics (T=25OC unless otherwise specified)Rating Symbol Value Units\nPeak Pulse Power (tp = 8/20µs) PPK500 W\nPeak Pulse Current (tp = 8/20µs) IPP25 A\nLead Soldering Temperature TL260 (10 sec.)OC\nOperating Temperature TOP-40 to +85OC\nStorage Temperature TSTG-55 to +150OC\nParameter Symbol Conditions Min.

When the voltage on the protected line \nexceeds the punch-through or “turn-on” voltage of the TVS \ndiode, the steering diodes are forward biased, conducting \nthe transient current away from the sensitive circuitry.\nData lines are connected at pins 1, 4, 6 and 7.  Pins 5 and 8 \nshould be connected directly to a ground plane.  The path \nlength is kept as short as possible to minimize parasitic \ninductance.\nNote that pins 2 and 3 are connected internally to the \ncathode of the low voltage TVS.  It is not recommended \nthat these pins be directly connected to a DC source \ngreater than the snap-back votlage (VSB) as the device\ncan latch on as described below.  \nEPD TVS IV Characterisitc Curve\nThese devices are constructed using Semtech’s proprietary \nEPD technology. By utilizing the EPD technology, the \nSRDA3.3-4 can effectively operate at 3.3V while maintaining \nexcellent electrical characteristics. \nThe EPD TVS employs a complex nppn structure in \ncontrast to the pn structure normally found in traditional \nsilicon-avalanche TVS diodes.  Since the EPD TVS devices \nuse a 4-layer structure, they exhibit a slightly different IV Data Line Protection Using Internal TVS Diode as Reference\nIRIPP\nVCVPTVSBVRWMISB\nIPTVBR\nIBRcharacteristic curve when compared to conventional \ndevices.  During normal operation, the device represents \na high-impedance to the circuit up to the device working \nvoltage (VRWM).  During an ESD event, the device will \nbegin to conduct and will enter a low impedance state \nwhen the punch through voltage (VPT) is exceeded.  \nUnlike a conventional device, the low voltage TVS will \nexhibit a slight negative resistance characteristic as it \nconducts current.  This characteristic aids in lowering the \nclamping voltage of the device, but must be considered \nin applications where DC voltages are present.\nWhen the TVS is conducting current, it will exhibit a  slight \n“snap-back” or negative resistance characteristics due to \nits structure.  This point is defined on the curve by the \nsnap-back voltage (VSB) and snap-back current (ISB). To \nreturn to a non-conducting state, the current through the \ndevice must fall below the ISB (approximately <50mA) and \nthe voltage must fall below the VSB (normally 2.8 V for a 3.3 \nV device).  If a 3.3 V TVS is connected to 3.3V DC source, \nit will never fall below the snap-back voltage of 2.8V and \nwill therefore stay in a conducting state.\nEPD TVS IV Characteristic Curve\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5I/O 1\nNC\nNCI/O 2\nI/O 3\nI/O 4\nSRDA3.3-4\nFinal Datasheet   Rev 3.1\n11/01/2018\nwww.semtech.com5 \nSemtech\nProprietary & ConfidentialTypical Application\nRTIP\nRRIN G\nTTIP\nTRIN GT1/E1 \nTransceiverR1\nR3\nR2\nT1\nT2LC01-6\nLC01-6SRDA 3.3-4\n1 45 8PTC\nPTC\nPTC\nPTCR4\nR5\nT1/E1 Interface Protection (GR-1089 Long Haul)\nSRDA3.3-4\nFinal Datasheet   Rev 3.1\n11/01/2018\nwww.semtech.com6 \nSemtech\nProprietary & ConfidentialOutline Drawing - SO-8\nLand Pattern - SO-88\n0.251.27 BSC6.00 3.904.90-\n3.804.800.39\n4.005.000.47\n0°\n0.200.10- 8°0.500.201.300.10-\n(1.05)--\n0.800.241.40-- 1.75\n1.500.225\n0.25 0.50 -\n3.
