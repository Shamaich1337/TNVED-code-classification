The performance of chip multilayer ceramic capacitors may be affected by the storage conditions.\n 1-1. Store the capacitors in the following conditions: \n         Room Temperature of +5 ℃ to +40℃ and a Relative Humidity of 20% to 70%.\n    (1) High temperature and humidity conditions may accelerate the deterioration of mountability due to oxidation \n\u3000          of the terminal electrodes and deterioration of taping/packaging performance.\n          Therefore, maintain the appropriate storage temperature and humidity.\n    (2) Prolonged storage may cause oxidation of the electrodes and deterioration of the packaging materials. \n          If more than six months have elapsed since delivery, check the mounting before use.\n          Even if the storage period is short, do not exceed the specified atmospheric conditions.\n    (3) Store the capacitors in the original packaging without opening the smallest packing unit. \n          Do not exceed the above atmospheric conditions for any length of time.\n 1-2. Corrosive gas can react with the termination (external) electrodes or lead wires of capacitors, and result\n          in poor mountability. Do not store the capacitors in an atmosphere consisting of corrosive gas (e.g.,hydrogen  \n         sulfide, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, ammonia gas etc.).\n 1-3. Due to moisture condensation caused by rapid humidity changes, or the photochemical change caused\n         by direct sunlight on the terminal electrodes and/or the resin/epoxy coatings, the mountability and electrical\n         performance may deteriorate. Do not store capacitors under direct sunlight or in high huimidity conditions.\n■Rating\n1.Temperature Dependent Characteristics\n1. The electrical characteristics of the capacitor can change with temperature.\n 1-1. For capacitors having larger temperature dependency, the capacitance may change with temperature \n         changes. The following actions are recommended in order to ensure suitable capacitance values.\n    (1) Select a suitable capacitance for the operating temperature range.\n    (2) The capacitance may change within the rated temperature.\n          When you use a high dielectric constant type capacitor in a circuit that needs a tight (narrow) capacitance \n          tolerance (e.g., a time-constant circuit), please carefully consider the temperature characteristics, and \n          carefully confirm the various characteristics in actual use conditions and the actual system.\n          \n   [Example of Temperature Caracteristics X7R(R7)]              [Example of  Temperature Characteristics X5R(R6)] \n    Sample: 0.1μF, Rated Voltage 50VDC                                      Sample: 22μF, Rated Voltage 4VDC!\n-20-10\n-15-55\n0101520\nTemperature (  C)-75 -50 -25 0 25 50 75 100    125    150Capacitance Change (%)\n-20-10\n-15-55\n0101520\nTemperature (  C)-75 -50 -25 0 25 50 75 100Capacitance Change (%)\nJEMCSC-0002D 7\n2.Measurement of Capacitance\n1. Measure capacitance with the voltage and frequency specified in the product specifications.\n 1-1. The output voltage of the measuring equipment may decrease occasionally when capacitance is high.\n         Please confirm whether a prescribed measured voltage is impressed to the capacitor.\n 1-2. The capacitance values of high dielectric constant type capacitors change depending on the AC voltage applied.\n         Please consider the AC voltage characteristics when selecting a capacitor to be used in a AC circuit.\n3.Applied Voltage\n1. Do not apply a voltage to the capacitor that exceeds the rated voltage as called out in the specifications.\n 1-1. Applied voltage between the terminals of a capacitor shall be less than or equal to the rated voltage.\n    (1) When AC voltage is superimposed on DC voltage, the zero-to-peak voltage shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\n          When AC voltage or pulse voltage is applied, the peak-to-peak voltage shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\n    (2) Abnormal voltages (surge voltage, static electricity, pulse voltage, etc.) shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\n               \nTypical Voltage Applied to the DC capacitor\nDC Voltage DC Voltage+AC AC Voltage Pulse Voltage\n(E：Maximum possible applied voltage.)\n 1-2. Influence of over voltage\n         Over voltage that is applied to the capacitor may result in an electrical short circuit caused by the breakdown \n         of the internal dielectric layers .\n         The time duration until breakdown depends on the applied voltage and the ambient temperature.\n4.Type of Applied Voltage and Self-heating Temperature\n1.Confirm the operating conditions to make sure that no large current is flowing into the capacitor due to the\n    continuous application of an AC voltage or pulse voltage.\n    When a DC rated voltage product is used in an AC voltage circuit or a pulse voltage circuit, the AC current\n    or pulse current will flow into the capacitor; therefore check the self-heating condition.\n    Please confirm the surface temperature of the capacitor so that the temperature remains within the upper limits\n    of the operating temperature, including the rise in temperature due to self-heating. When the capacitor is\n    used with a high-frequency voltage or pulse voltage, heat may be generated by dielectric loss.\n<Applicable to Rated Voltage of less than 100VDC>\n  The load should be contained so that the self-heating\n\u3000of the capacitor body remains below 20°C ,\n\u3000when\n  measuring at an ambient temperature of 25°C.Caution\n110100\n0 1 2 3\nCurrent (Ar.m.s.)4 5 6Temperature Rise ( C)[Example ofTemperature Rise (Heat Generation) inChip\nMultilayer Ceramic Capacitors inContrast toRipple Current]\nSample :R(R1)characteristics 10μF,Rated voltage :DC10V\nRipple Current\n100kHz\n500kHz\n1MHz\n!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n E E E E \n0 0 0 \n0 \nJEMCSC-0002D 8\n5. DC Voltage and AC Voltage Characteristic\n1. The capacitance value of a high dielectric constant type\n    capacitor changes depending on the DC voltage applied.\n    Please consider the DC voltage characteristics when a\n    capacitor is selected for use in a DC circuit. \n 1-1. The capacitance of ceramic capacitors may change\n         sharply  depending on the applied voltage. (See figure)\n         Please confirm the following in order to secure the\n         capacitance.\n   (1) Determine whether the capacitance change caused\n         by the applied voltage is within the allowed range . \n   (2) In the DC voltage characteristics, the rate of\n         capacitance change becomes larger as voltage\n         increases, even if the applied voltage is below\n         the rated voltage. When a high dielectric constant\n         type capacitor is used in a circuit that requires a\n         tight (narrow) capacitance tolerance (e.g., a time\n        constant circuit), please carefully consider the\n        voltage characteristics, and confirm  the various\n        characteristics in the actual operating conditions \n \u3000    of the system.\n2. The capacitance values of high dielectric\n     constant type capacitors changes depending\n     on the AC voltage applied.\n     Please consider the AC voltage characteristics\n     when  selecting a capacitor to be used in a \n     AC circuit.\n6. Capacitance Aging\n[ Example of Change Over Time (Aging characteristics) ]\n1. The high dielectric constant type capacitors\n     have an Aging characteristic in which the capacitance \n     value decreases with the passage of time.\n     When you use a high dielectric constant type\n     capacitors in a circuit that needs a tight (narrow)\n     capacitance tolerance (e.g., a time-constant circuit), \n     please carefully consider the characteristics  \n     of these capacitors, such as their aging, voltage, \n     and temperature characteristics. In addition, \n     check capacitors using your actual appliances \n     at the intended environment and operating conditions.\n     \n7.Vibration and Shock\n1.  Please confirm the kind of vibration and/or shock, its condition, and any generation of resonance.\n     Please mount the capacitor so as not to generate resonance, and do not allow any impact on the terminals.\n \n2. Mechanical shock due to being dropped may cause damage or \n    a crack in the dielectric material of the capacitor. \n    Do not use a dropped capacitor because the quality and reliability \n    may be deteriorated.\n3. When printed circuit boards are piled up or handled, the corner\n\u3000of another printed circuit board\n    should not be allowed to hit the capacitor in order to avoid \n    a crack or other damage to the capacitor.Caution\n-100-80-60-40-20020\n0 10 20 30\nDC Voltage (V)40 50[Example of DC Voltage Characteristics]\nSample : X7R( R7)Characteristics 0.1μF, Rated Voltage 50VDCCapacitance Change (%)\n0 0.5 1\nAC Voltage (Vr.m.s.)1.5 2[Example of  AC Voltage Characteristics]\nSample : X7R( R7)Characteristics 10μF, Rated Voltage 6.3VDCCapacitance Change (%)\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\n-50\n-60\nFloorCrack\nMounting printed circuit board\nCrack!\n \n \n \n \n \n 20 \n10 \n0 \n-10 \n-20 \n-30 \n-40 \n10 100 1000 10000  \nTime(h ) Capacitance Change (%) \nC0G( 5C) \nX7R(R7) \nX5R(R6) \nJEMCSC-0002D 9\n■Mounting\n1.Mounting Position\n1. Confirm the best mounting position and direction that minimizes the stress imposed on the capacitor during flexing\n    or bending the printed circuit board.\n 1-1.Choose a mounting position that minimizes the stress imposed on the chip during flexing or bending of the board.\n\u3000  [Component Direction]\nLocate chip horizontal to the\ndirection in which stress acts.\n(Bad Example) (Good Example)\n      [Chip Mounting Close to Board Separation Point]\nIt is effective to implement the following measures, to reduce stress in separating the board.\nIt is best to implement all of the following three measures; however, implement as many measures as possible\nto reduce stress.\nStress Level\n(1) Turn the mounting direction of the component parallel to the board separation surface. A\u3000>\u3000D *1\n(2) Add slits in the board separation part. A\u3000>\u3000B\n(3) Keep the mounting position of the component away from the board separation surface. A\u3000>\u3000C\n*1 A > D is valid when stress is added vertically to the perforation as with Hand Separation.\n     If a Cutting Disc is used, stress will be diagonal to the PCB, therefore A > D is invalid.\n      [Mounting Capacitors Near Screw Holes]\nWhen a capacitor is mounted near a screw hole, it may be affected by the board deflection that occurs during\n the tightening of the screw. Mount the capacitor in a position as far away from the screw holes as possible.\n\u3000\n2.Information before Mounting\n1. Do not re-use capacitors that were removed from the equipment.\n2. Confirm capacitance characteristics under actual applied voltage.\n3. Confirm the mechanical stress under actual process and equipment use.\n4. Confirm the rated capacitance, rated voltage and other electrical characteristics before assembly.\n5. Prior to measuring capacitance, carry out a heat treatment for capacitors that were in long-term storage.Caution\nContents of Measures\nScrew HoleRecommended!\n \n \n \n \n \n ① \n② ③ 1C 1B 1A Perforation  \n \nSlit A B C \nD \n \n \n \n \n \n ① \n1A \nJEMCSC-0002D 10\n3.Maintenance of the Mounting (pick and place) Machine\n1.

Avoid bending the printed circuit board by the pressure of a test-probe, etc.\n          The thrusting force of the test probe can flex the PCB, resulting in cracked chips.\n          Provide support pins on the back side of the PCB to prevent warping or flexing.\n          Install support pins as close to the test-probe as possible.\n    1-2. Avoid vibration of the board by shock when a test -probe contacts a printed circuit board.\n[Not Recommended] [Recommended]\n5.Printed Circuit Board Cropping\n1. After mounting a capacitor on a printed circuit board, do not apply any stress to the capacitor that\n    caused bending or twisting the board.\n    1-1. In cropping the board, the stress as shown may cause the capacitor to crack.\n           Cracked capacitors may cause deterioration of the insulation resistance, and result in a short.\n           Avoid this type of stress to a capacitor. \n [Bending]  [Twisting]\n2. Check the cropping method for the  printed circuit board in advance.\n    2-1. Printed circuit board cropping shall be carried out by using a jig or an apparatus (Disc separator, router \n           type separator, etc.) to prevent the mechanical stress that can occur to the board.\n* When a board separation jig or disc separator is used, if the following precautions are not observed, \n   a large board deflection stress will occur and the capacitors may crack. \n   Use router type separator if at all possible.NotesHand and nipper\nseparation apply a high\nlevel of stress.\nUse another method.· Board handling\n· Board bending direction\n· Layout of capacitors· Board handling\n· Layout of slits\n· Design of V groove\n· Arrangement of blades\n· Controlling blade lifeBoard handlingLevel of stress on board High Medium Medium Low\nRecommended × △* △* ◯Caution\nBoard Separation MethodHand Separation\nNipper Separation(1) Board Separation JigBoard Separation Apparatus\n2) Disc Separator 3) Router Type Separator!\n \n \n \n \n \n ① \n1A \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTest-probe  Test-probe  \n Support  Pin \nJEMCSC-0002D 12\n(1) Example of a suitable jig\n     [In the case of Single-side Mounting]\n       An outline of the board separation jig is shown as follows. \n       Recommended example: Stress on the component mounting position can be minimized by holding the\n       portion close to the jig, and bend in the direction towards the side where the capacitors are mounted. \n       Not recommended example: The risk of cracks occurring in the capacitors increases due to large stress\n       being applied to the component mounting position, if the portion away from the jig is held and bent in the\n       direction opposite the side where the capacitors are mounted.\n         [Outline of jig] [Hand Separation]\n     [In the case of Double-sided Mounting]\n      Since components are mounted on both sides of the board, the risk of cracks occurring can not be avoided with the \n      above method. Therefore, implement the following measures to prevent stress from being applied to the components.\n\u3000   (Measures)\n      (1) Consider introducing a router type separator.\n\u3000       \u3000If it is difficult to introduce a router type separator, implement the following measures.\n            (Refer to item 1. Mounting Position)\n      (2) Mount the components parallel to the board separation surface.\n      (3) When mounting components near the board separation point, add slits in the separation position \n            near the component.      \n      (4) Keep the mounting position of the components away from the board separation point.\n(2) Example of a Disc Separator\n       An outline of a disc separator is shown as follows.  As shown in the Principle of Operation, the top \n       blade and bottom blade are aligned with the V-grooves on the printed circuit board to separate the board. \n       In the following case, board deflection stress will be applied and cause cracks in the capacitors.\n       (1) When the adjustment of the top and bottom blades are misaligned, such as deviating in the top-bottom, \n             left-right or front-rear directions \n       (2) The angle of the V groove is too low, depth of the V groove is too shallow, or the V groove is misaligned   \n             top-bottom\n       IF V groove is too deep, it is possible to brake when you handle and carry it. Carefully design depth of the \n       V groove with consideration about strength of material of the printed circuit board.\n       \n[ Outline of Machine ] [ Principle of Operation ] [ Cross-section Diagram ]\n[Disc Separator]\nTop Blade Top Blade Top Blade Top Blade\nBottom Blade Bottom Blade Bottom Blade Bottom Blade\n[V-groove Design]\nExample of Recommended\nV-groove DesignNot Recommended\nLeft-right Misalignment Low-Angle Depth too Shallow Depth too DeepCaution\nRecommended Not recommended\nRecommendedNot recommended\nTop-bottom Misalignment Left-right Misalignment Front-rear Misalignment\nPrinted Circuit BoardTop Blade\nV-grooveBottom BladeTop Blade Printed Circuit Board\nV-groove!\nBoard Cropping JigV-groovePrinted Circuit Board\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrinted circuit  \nboard  \n Components  \n Load point  \n Direction of   \nload \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Printed circuit  \nboard  \n Component\ns \n \nLoad point  \n Direction of load \nJEMCSC-0002D 13\n(3) Example of Router Type Separator\n      The router type separator performs cutting by a router \n      rotating at a high speed. Since the board does not  \n      bend in the cutting process, stress on the board can  \n      be suppressed during board separation. \n      When attaching or removing boards to/from the router type \n      separator, carefully handle the boards to prevent bending.\n6. Assembly\n1. Handling\n     If a board mounted with capacitors is held with one hand, the board may bend.\n     Firmly hold the edges of the board with both hands when handling.\n     If a board mounted with capacitors is dropped, cracks may occur in the capacitors.\n     Do not use dropped boards, as there is a possibility that the quality of the capacitors may be impaired.\n2. Attachment of Other Components\n 2-1. Mounting of Other Components\n         Pay attention to the following items, when mounting other components on the back side of the board after \n         capacitors have been mounted on the opposite side.\n         When the bottom dead point of the suction nozzle is set too low, board deflection stress may be applied \n         to the capacitors on the back side (bottom side), and cracks may occur  in the capacitors.\n        · After the board is straightened, set the bottom dead point of the nozzle on the upper surface of the board.\n        · Periodically check and adjust the bottom dead point.\n 2-2. Inserting Components with Leads into Boards\n         When inserting components (transformers, IC, etc.) into boards, bending the board may cause cracks in the capacitors.\n         Pay attention to the following.\n        · Increase the size of the holes to insert the leads, to reduce the stress on the board during insertion.\n        · Fix the board with support pins or a dedicated jig before insertion.\n        · Support below the board so that the board does not bend. When using support pins on the board, \n           periodically confirm that there is no difference in the height of each support pin.\n 2-3. Attaching/Removing Sockets and/or connectors\n         The board may bend when a socket and/or connector are attached or removed. \n         Plan the work so that the board does not bend when a socket and/or connector are attached or removed.\n 2-4. Tightening Screws\n         The board may be bent, when tightening screws, etc. during the attachment of the board to a shield or\n         chassis. Pay attention to the following items before performing the work.\n        · Plan the work to prevent the board from bending.\n        · Use a torque screwdriver, to prevent over-tightening of the screws.\n        · The board may bend after mounting by reflow soldering, etc. Please note, as stress may be applied \n           to the chips by forcibly flattening the board when tightening the screws.Caution!\nSuction  Nozzle\nComponent with Leads\nSocket\nScrewdriver[Outline Drawing ] Router\nJEMCSC-0002D 14\n7.

Under Operation of Equipment\n 1-1. Do not touch a capacitor directly with bare hands during operation in order to avoid the danger of an electric shock.\n           \n 1-2. Do not allow the terminals of a capacitor to come in contact with any conductive objects (short-circuit).\n         Do not expose a capacitor to a conductive liquid, inducing any acid or alkali solutions.\n 1-3. Confirm the environment in which the equipment will operate is under the specified conditions.\n         Do not use the equipment under the following environments.\n         (1) Being spattered with water or oil.\n         (2) Being exposed to direct sunlight.\n         (3) Being exposed to ozone, ultraviolet rays, or radiation.\n         (4) Being exposed to toxic gas (e.g., hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, ammonia gas etc.)\n         (5) Any vibrations or mechanical shocks exceeding the specified limits.\n         (6) Moisture condensing environments.\n 1-4. Use damp proof countermeasures if using under any conditions that can cause condensation.\n2. Others\n 2-1. In an Emergency\n   (1) If the equipment should generate smoke, fire, or smell, immediately turn off or unplug the equipment.\n         If the equipment is not turned off or unplugged, the hazards may be worsened by supplying continuous power.\n   (2) In this type of situation, do not allow face and hands to come in contact with the capacitor or burns may be caused \n         by the capacitor's high temperature.\n 2-2. Disposal of waste\n    When capacitors are disposed of, they must be burned or buried by an industrial waste vendor with the appropriate \n    licenses.       \n 2-3. Circuit Design\n   (1) Addition of Fail Safe Function\n         Capacitors that are cracked by dropping or bending of the board may cause deterioration of the\n         insulation resistance, and result in a short. If the circuit being used may cause an electrical shock, \n         smoke or fire when a capacitor is shorted, be sure to install fail-safe functions, such as a fuse, \n         to prevent secondary accidents.\n   (2) This series are not safety standard certified products.\n 2-4. Remarks\n    Failure to follow the cautions may result, worst case,  in a short circuit and smoking when the product is used.\n    The above notices are for standard applications and conditions.

Caution!\nJEMCSC-0002D 16\n■ Rating\n1.Operating Temperature\n1. The operating temperature limit depends on the capacitor. \n 1-1. Do not apply temperatures exceeding the maximum operating temperature.\n         It is necessary to select a capacitor with a suitable rated temperature that will cover the operating temperature range.\n         It is also necessary to consider the temperature distribution in equipment and the seasonal temperature variable\n         factor.\n 1-2. Consider the self-heating factor of the capacitor\n         The surface temperature of the capacitor shall not exceed the maximum operating temperature including self-heating. \n2.Atmosphere Surroundings (gaseous and liquid)\n1. Restriction on the operating environment of capacitors.\n 1-1. Capacitors, when used in the above, unsuitable, operating environments may deteriorate due to the corrosion \n         of the terminations and the penetration of moisture into the capacitor.\n 1-2. The same phenomenon as the above may occur when the electrodes or terminals of the capacitor are subject \n         to moisture condensation.\n 1-3. The deterioration of characteristics and insulation resistance due to the oxidization or corrosion of terminal \n \u3000\u3000electrodes may result in breakdown when the capacitor is exposed to corrosive or volatile gases or solvents\n         for long periods of time.\n3.Piezo-electric Phenomenon\n1. When using high dielectric constant type capacitors in AC or pulse circuits, the capacitor itself vibrates \n    at specific frequencies and noise may be generated.\n    Moreover, when the mechanical vibration or shock is added to capacitor, noise may occur.Notice\nJEMCSC-0002D 17\n■Mounting\n1.PCB Design\n    When designing the board, keep in mind that \n    the amount of strain which occurs will increase \n\u3000 depending on the sizeand material of the board.\n2.Coating\n1. A crack may be caused in the capacitor due to the stress of the thermal contraction of the resin during curing process.\n    The stress is affected by the amount of resin and curing contraction. Select a resin with low curing contraction.\n    The difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between a coating resin or a molding resin and the capacitor \n    may cause the destruction and deterioration of the capacitor such as a crack or peeling, and lead to the deterioration\n    of insulation resistance or dielectric breakdown.\n    Select a resin for which the thermal expansion coefficient is as close to that of the capacitor as possible.\n    A silicone resin can be used as an under-coating to buffer against the stress.\n2. Select a resin that is less hygroscopic.\n    Using hygroscopic resins under high humidity conditions may cause the deterioration of the insulation resistance \n    of a capacitor. An epoxy resin can be used as a less hygroscopic resin.\n3．The halogen system substance and organic acid are included in coating material, and a chip corrodes\n\u3000\u3000by the kind of Coating material.

The performance of a capacitor may be affected by the conditions during transportation.\n 1-1. The capacitors shall be protected against excessive temperature, humidity and mechanical force during transportation.\n          (1) Climatic condition \n             \u3000･ low air temperature : -40 ℃\n                 ･ change of temperature air/air : -25 ℃/+25℃\n                 ･ low air pressure : 30 kPa\n                 ･ change of air pressure : 6 kPa/min.\n         (2) Mechanical condition \n                Transportation shall be done in such a way that the boxes are not deformed and forces are not directly passed\n                on to the inner packaging.\n 1-2. Do not apply excessive vibration, shock, or pressure to the capacitor.\n         (1) When excessive mechanical shock or pressure is applied to a capacitor, chipping or cracking may occur \n               in the ceramic body of the capacitor.\n         (2) When the sharp edge of an air driver, a soldering iron, tweezers, a chassis, etc. impacts strongly on the surface\n               of the capacitor, the capacitor may crack and short-circuit.\n 1-3. Do not use a capacitor to which excessive shock was applied by dropping etc.\n         A capacitor dropped accidentally during processing may be damaged.\n2.Characteristics Evaluation in the Actual System\n1. Evaluate the capacitor in the actual system,to confirm that there is no problem with the performance and specification \n     values in a finished product before using.\n2. Since a voltage dependency and temperature dependency exists in the capacitance of high dielectric type ceramic \n     capacitors, the capacitance may change depending on the operating conditions in the actual system.\n     Therefore,be sure to evaluate the various characteristics, such as the leakage current and noise absorptivity,\n     which will affect the capacitance value of the capacitor.\n3. In addition,voltages exceeding the predetermined surge may be applied to the capacitor by the inductance in \n     the actual system. Evaluate the surge resistance in the actual system as required.Notice\nJEMCSC-0002D 19\nNOTE\n1.Please make sure that your product has been evaluated in view of your specifications with our\n   product being mounted to your product.\n2.Your are requested not to use our product deviating from this product specification.\n3.We consider it not appropriate to include any terms and conditions with regard to the business\n   transaction in the product specifications, drawings or other technical documents.
