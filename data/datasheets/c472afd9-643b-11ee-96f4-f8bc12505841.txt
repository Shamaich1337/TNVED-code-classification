Temperatures quoted in relation to wave\nsoldering refer to the pin, not the housing.\n■If the components are to be washed varnished it is necessary to check whether the washing\nvarnish agent that is used has a negative effect on the wire insulation, any plastics that are used,\nor on glued joints. In particular, it is possible for washing varnish agent residues to have a\nnegative effect in the long-term on wire insulation.\nWashing processes may damage the product due to the possible static or cyclic mechanical\nloads (e.g. ultrasonic cleaning). They may cause cracks to develop on the product and its parts,\nwhich might lead to reduced reliability or lifetime.  \n■The following points must be observed if the components are potted in customer applications: \n– Many potting materials shrink as they harden. They therefore exert a pressure on the plastic\nhousing or core. This pressure can have a deleterious effect on electrical properties, and in\nextreme cases can damage the core or plastic housing mechanically.\n– It is necessary to check whether the potting material used attacks or destroys the wire\ninsulation, plastics or glue.\n– The effect of the potting material can change the high-frequency behaviour of the components.\n■Ferrites are sensitive to direct impact. This can cause the core material to flake, or lead to\nbreakage of the core.\n■Even for customer-specific products, conclusive validation of the component in the circuit can\nonly be carried out by the customer.\nPlease read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\n10 10/12Important notes\nThe following applies to all products named in this publication:\n1. Some parts of this publication contain statements about the suitability of our products for\ncertain areas of application . These statements are based on our knowledge of typical\nrequirements that are often placed on our products in the areas of application concerned. We\nnevertheless expressly point out that such statements cannot be regarded as binding\nstatements about the suitability of our products for a particular customer application.  As\na rule, EPCOS is either unfamiliar with individual customer applications or less familiar with them\nthan the customers themselves. For these reasons, it is always ultimately incumbent on the\ncustomer to check and decide whether an EPCOS product with the properties described in the\nproduct specification is suitable for use in a particular customer application.\n2. We also point out that  in individual cases, a malfunction of electronic components or\nfailure before the end of their usual service life cannot be completely ruled out in the\ncurrent state of the art, even if they are operated as specified.  In customer applications\nrequiring a very high level of operational safety and especially in customer applications in which\nthe malfunction or failure of an electronic component could endanger human life or health (e.g.\nin accident prevention or life-saving systems), it must therefore be ensured by means of suitable\ndesign of the customer application or other action taken by the customer (e.g. installation of\nprotective circuitry or redundancy) that no injury or damage is sustained by third parties in the\nevent of malfunction or failure of an electronic component.\n3.The warnings, cautions and product-specific notes must be observed .\n4. In order to satisfy certain technical requirements, some of the products described in this\npublication may contain substances subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions (e.g.\nbecause they are classed as hazardous) . Useful information on this will be found in our\nMaterial Data Sheets on the Internet (www.epcos.com/material). Should you have any more\ndetailed questions, please contact our sales offices.\n5. We constantly strive to improve our products. Consequently, the products described in this\npublication may change from time to time . The same is true of the corresponding product\nspecifications. Please check therefore to what extent product descriptions and specifications\ncontained in this publication are still applicable before or when you place an order.\nWe also reserve the right to discontinue production and delivery of products .\nConsequently, we cannot guarantee that all products named in this publication will always be\navailable. The aforementioned does not apply in the case of individual agreements deviating\nfrom the foregoing for customer-specific products.\n6.
