#### Description:
The KMZ41 is a sensitive magnetic field sensor that utilizes the magneto-resistive effect of thin film permalloy. It features two Wheatstone bridges arranged at a 45-degree angle, allowing it to detect rotating magnetic fields. The sensor outputs two independent sinusoidal signals corresponding to the angle of the magnetic field, with a recommended field strength greater than 100 kA/m for optimal performance. It operates effectively across a frequency range from DC to 1 MHz.

#### Typical Applications:
The KMZ41 is primarily used in applications requiring precise angle measurement and magnetic field detection. Typical applications include:
- **Robotics:** For position sensing and navigation.
- **Automotive:** In systems for steering angle detection and other magnetic field-related measurements.
- **Industrial Automation:** For monitoring and controlling machinery based on magnetic field changes.
- **Consumer Electronics:** In devices that require orientation sensing, such as smartphones and tablets.
- **Medical Devices:** For non-contact sensing applications.

This component is particularly advantageous in environments where mechanical wear is a concern, as its contactless operation ensures longevity and reliability.
