The parts contain \na low noise, wide bandwidth track-and-hold amplifier, which \ncan handle input frequencies in excess of 6 MHz.  \nThe conversion process and data acquisition are controlled \nusing CS\n and the serial clock, allowing the devices to interface \nwith microprocessors or DSPs. The conversion rate is \ndetermined by the SCLK signal. The input signal is sampled on \nthe falling edge of CS and the conversion is also initiated at this \npoint. The channel to be converted is selected through the DIN pin, and the mode of operation is controlled by CS\n. The serial \ndata stream from the DOUT pin has a channel identifier bit and \nmode identifier bit, which provide information about the \nconverted channel and the current mode of operation.

The AD7912/AD7922 feature a daisy-chain mode that \nallows the user to read the conversion results from the ADCs contained in the chain. The AD7912/AD7922 use advanced design techniques to achieve very low power dissipation at high throughput rates. The reference for the part is taken internally from V\nDD, thereby allowing the widest dynamic input range to \nthe ADC.  \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. 2-channel, 1 MSPS, 10-/12-bit ADCs in TSOT package. \n2. High throughput with low power consumption. \n3. Flexible power/serial clock speed management.  \nThe conversion rate is determined by the serial clock. The \nparts also feature a power-down mode to maximize power efficiency at lower throughput rates. Average power consumption is reduced when the power-down mode is used while not converting. Current consumption is 1 µA \nmaximum and 50 nA typically when in power-down mode. \n4. Daisy-chain mode. \n5. No pipeline delay. \nThe parts feature a standard successive approximation ADC \nwith accurate control of the sampling instant via a CS\n input \nand once-off conversion control. \n \n \n \n1 Protected by U.S. Patent Number 6,681,332. \nAD7912/AD7922 \n \nRev. 0 | Page 2 of 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS \nSpecifications..................................................................................... 3  \nAD7912 Specifications................................................................. 3  \nAD7922 Specifications................................................................. 5  \nTiming Specifications .................................................................. 7  \nTiming Diagrams.......................................................................... 7  \nTiming Examples.......................................................................... 8  \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings............................................................ 9  \nESD Caution.................................................................................. 9  \nPin Configurations and Function Descriptions ......................... 10  \nTerminology .................................................................................... 11  \nTypical Performance Characteristics ........................................... 13  \nCircuit Information........................................................................ 15  \nConverter Operation.................................................................. 15  \nADC Transfer Function............................................................. 15  \nTypical Connection Diagram ................................................... 16  \nAnalog Input ............................................................................... 16  \nDigital Inputs .............................................................................. 17  DIN Input.................................................................................... 17  \nDOUT Output ............................................................................ 17  \nModes of Operation ....................................................................... 18  \nNormal Mode.............................................................................. 18  \nPower-Down Mode.................................................................... 18  \nPower-Up Time .......................................................................... 20  \nDaisy-Chain Mode..................................................................... 20  \nDaisy-Chain Example................................................................ 22  \nPower vs. Throughput Rate ........................................................... 24  \nSerial Interface ................................................................................ 25  \nMicroprocessor Interfacing....................................................... 26  \nApplication Hints ........................................................................... 28  \nGrounding and Layout .............................................................. 28  \nEvaluating AD7912/AD7922 Performance................................. 29  \nOutline Dimensions ....................................................................... 30  \nOrdering Guide .......................................................................... 30  \n \nREVISION HISTORY \nRevision 0: Initial Version \n \n \n \n AD7912/AD7922\n \nRev. 0 | Page 3 of 32 SPECIFICATIONS \nAD7912 SPECIFICATIONS \nTemperature range for A Grade from −40°C to +85°C. \nVDD = 2.35 V to 5.25 V , f SCLK = 18 MHz, f SAMPLE  = 1 MSPS;

This allows a value of 126 ns for tQUIET, \nsatisfying the minimum requirement of 30 ns. Timing Example 2 \nThe AD7922 can also operate with slower clock frequencies. As shown in Figure 7, when f\nSCLK = 5 MHz and the throughput rate \nis 315 kSPS, the cycle time is  \nt2 + 12.5(1/ fSCLK) + tACQ = 3.17 µs  \nWith t2 = 10 ns minimum, then tACQ is 664 ns, which satisfies the \nrequirement of 290 ns for tACQ.  \nIn Figure 7, tACQ is comprised of 2.5(1/ fSCLK) + t10 + tQUIET, where \nt10 = 30 ns maximum. This allows a value of 134 ns for tQUIET, \nsatisfying the minimum requirement of 30 ns.  \nIn this example, as with other slower clock values, the signal \nmight already be acquired before the conversion is complete, \nbut it is still necessary to leave 30 ns minimum tQUIET between \nconversions. In this example, the signal should be fully acquired \nat approximately point C in Figure 7. \n \n04351-0-006ZERO\nX12345 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6\nX CHN STY X X X X XCHN MOD DB11 DB10 DB2 DB1 DB0 Zt2 t6\nt4\nt8 t9t3t7t5 t10t1\ntQUIETtCONVERT\nSCLKCS\nDOUT\nTHREE-STATE THREE-STATE\nDINB\n \nFigure 6.

For the AD7912/ \nAD7922, the endpoints of the transfer function are zero scale, a \npoint 1 LSB below the first code transition, and full scale, a \npoint 1 LSB above the last code transition. \nDifferential Nonlinearity \nThe difference between the measured and the ideal 1 LSB \nchange between any two adjacent codes in the ADC. \nOffset Error \nThe deviation of the first code transition (00…000) to \n(00… 001) from the ideal, that is, AGND + 1 LSB. \nOffset Error Match The difference in offset error between any two channels. \nGain Error \nThe deviation of the last code transition (111…110) to \n(111…111) from the ideal, that is, V\nDD − 1 LSB after the offset \nerror has been adjusted out. \nGain Error Match \nThe difference in gain error between any two channels. \nTota l Una djuste d E rror \nA comprehensive specification that includes gain error, linearity \nerror, and offset error. \nChannel-to-Channel Isolation \nA measure of the level of crosstalk between channels. It is \nmeasured by applying a full-scale sine wave signal of 20 kHz to \n500 kHz to the nonselected input channel and determining how \nmuch that signal is attenuated in the selected channel with a \n10 kHz signal. The figure is given worst case across both \nchannels for the AD7912/AD7922.  \nTrack-and-Hold Acquisition Time \nThe time required for the output of the track-and-hold \namplifier to reach its final value within ±1 LSB after the end of \nconversion. The track-and-hold amplifier returns to track mode \nat the end of conversion. See the Serial Interface section for \nmore details. Signal-to-Noise + Distortion Ratio (SINAD) \nThe measured ratio of signal-to-noise and distortion at the \noutput of the A/D converter. The signal is the rms value of the \nsine wave, and noise is the rms sum of all nonfundamental \nsignals up to half the sampling frequency (fs/2), including \nharmonics but excluding dc. \nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) \nThe measured ratio of signal to noise at the output to the A/D \nconverter. The signal is the rms value of the sine wave input. \nNoise is the rms quantization error within the Nyquist bandwidth (fs/2). The rms value of a sine wave is one-half its \npeak-to-peak value divided by √2, and the rms value for the \nquantization noise is q/√12. The ratio is dependent on the number of quantization levels in the digitization process; the more levels, the smaller the quantization noise. For an ideal N-bit converter, the SNR is defined as \ndB761 026 . N. SNR +=  \nTherefore, for a 12-bit converter, SNR is 74 dB; for a 10-bit \nconverter, SNR is 62 dB. \nHowever, various error sources in the ADC cause the measured \nSNR to be less than the theoretical value. These errors occur due \nto integral and differential nonlinearities, internal ac noise \nsources, and so on. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD) \nThe ratio of the rms sum of harmonics to the fundamental, \nwhich is defined as \n12\n62\n52\n42 2\n2\nVV V V V V\nTHD++++\n=3log20)dB( \nwhere: \nV1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental. \nV2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second \n through the sixth harmonics. \nPeak Harmonic or Spurious Noise \nThe ratio of the rms value of the next largest component in the \nADC output spectrum (up to fs /2 and excluding dc) to the rms \nvalue of the fundamental. Normally, the value of this specifica-tion is determined by the largest harmonic in the spectrum, but for ADCs where the harmonics are buried in the noise floor, it is \na noise peak. \nAD7912/AD7922 \n \nRev. 0 | Page 12 of 32 Intermodulation Distortion \nWith inputs consisting of sine waves at two frequencies, fa and \nfb, any active device with nonlinearities creates distortion \nproducts at sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where \nm, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Intermodulation distortion terms are \nthose for which neither m nor n is equal to zero. For example, \nthe second-order terms include (fa + fb) and (fa − fb), while the \nthird-order terms include (2fa + fb), (2fa − fb), (fa + 2fb), and \n(fa − 2fb). The AD7912/AD7922 are tested using the CCIF standard, \nwhere two input frequencies are used (see fa and fb in the \nSpecifications section). In this case, the second-order terms are usually distanced in frequency from the original sine waves, while the third-order terms are usually at a frequency close to the input frequencies. As a result, the second-order and third-\norder terms are specified separately. The calculation of the \nintermodulation distortion is as in the THD specification, where it is defined as the ratio of the rms sum of the individual distortion products to the rms amplitude of the sum of the \nfundamentals expressed in dB. \n \n \n AD7912/AD7922\n \nRev. 0 | Page 13 of 32 TYPICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS \nFigure 10 and Figure 11 show typical FFT plots for the AD7922 \nand AD7912, respectively, at a 1 MSPS sample rate and 100 kHz \ninput frequency. \nFigure 12 shows the SINAD performance versus the input \nfrequency for various supply voltages while sampling at 1 MSPS \nwith a SCLK frequency of 18 MHz for the AD7922. \nFigure 13 shows the SNR performance versus the input fre-\nquency for various supply voltages while sampling at 1 MSPS with an SCLK frequency of 18 MHz for the AD7922.

The \nparts can be operated from a 2.35 V to 5.25 V supply. When operated from either a 5 V supply or a 3 V supply, the AD7912/AD7922 are capable of throughput rates of 1 MSPS \nwhen provided with an 18 MHz clock. \nThe AD7912/AD7922 provide the user with an on-chip track-\nand-hold, an ADC, and a serial interface, all housed in a tiny \n8-lead TSOT package or 8-lead MSOP package, which offer the \nuser considerable space-saving advantages over alternative \nsolutions. The serial clock input accesses data from the parts, controls the transfer of data written to the ADC, and provides the clock source for the successive approximation ADC. The analog input range is 0 to V\nDD. An external reference is not \nrequired for the ADC, and neither is there a reference on-chip. \nThe reference for the AD7912/AD7922 is derived from the \npower supply and, therefore, gives the widest dynamic input \nrange. \nThe AD7912/AD7922 feature a power-down option that allows \npower saving between conversions. The power-down feature is \nimplemented across the standard serial interface as described in the Modes of Operation section. The AD7912/AD7922 can also be used in daisy-chain mode when several AD7912/AD7922 are connected in a daisy chain. This mode of operation is selected \nby controlling the logic state of the CS\n signal. The fourth MSB \non the DOUT pin indicates if the ADC is in normal mode or \ndaisy-chain mode. \nCONVERTER OPERATION \nThe AD7912/AD7922 are 10-/12-bit successive approximation \nADCs based around a charge redistribution DAC. Figure 19 and \nFigure 20 show simplified schematics of the ADC. Figure 19 shows the ADC during its acquisition phase. SW2 is closed and SW1 is in Position A, the comparator is held in a balanced condition, and the sampling capacitor acquires the signal on the selected V\nIN channel. \n04351-0-016COMPARATORACQUISITION\nPHASE\nVDD/2SW2 SW1VIN0\nVIN1SAMPLING\nCAPACITOR\nAGNDA\nBCHARGE\nREDISTRIBUTION\nDAC\nCONTROL\nLOGIC\n \nFigure 19.

The control logic and the charge redistri-bution DAC are used to add and subtract fixed amounts of charge from the sampling capacitor to bring the comparator back into a balanced condition. When the comparator is \nrebalanced, the conversion is complete. The control logic \ngenerates the ADC output code.

V REF is taken internally from V DD and as such V DD \nshould be well decoupled. This provides an analog input range \nof 0 V to V DD. The conversion result is output in a 16-bit word \nwith two leading zeros, followed by the channel identifier bit that identifies the channel converted, followed by the mode bit that indicates the current mode of operation, and by the MSB of the 12-bit or 10-bit result. For the AD7912, the 10-bit result is \nfollowed by two trailing zeros. See the Serial Interface section. \nAlternatively, because the supply current required by the \nAD7912/AD7922 is so low, a precision reference can be used as \nthe supply source to the AD7912/AD7922. A REF19x voltage reference (REF195 for 5 V or REF193 for 3 V) can be used to \nsupply the required voltage to the ADC (see Figure 22). This \nconfiguration is especially useful, if the power supply is quite noisy or if the system supply voltages are at some value other than 5 V or 3 V (for example, 15 V). The REF19x outputs a steady voltage to the AD7912/AD7922. If the low dropout REF193 is used, the current it needs to supply to the AD7912/ \nAD7922 is typically1.5 mA. When the ADC is converting at a \nrate of 1 MSPS, the REF193 needs to supply a maximum of 2 mA to the AD7912/AD7922. The load regulation of the REF193 is typically 10 ppm/mA (REF193, VS = 5 V), which results in an error of 20 ppm (60 µV) for the 2 mA drawn from \nit. This corresponds to a 0.082 LSB error for the AD7922 with \nV\nDD = 3 V from the REF193 and a 0.061 LSB error for the \nAD7912.  \nFor applications where power consumption is a concern, the \npower-down mode of the ADC and the sleep mode of the \nREF19x reference should be used to improve power perform-\nance.

The two diodes, D1 and D2, \nprovide ESD protection for the analog input. Care must be \ntaken to ensure that the analog input signal never exceeds the \nsupply rails by more than 300 mV , because this would cause these diodes to become forward biased and start conducting current into the substrate. The maximum current these diodes can conduct without causing irreversible damage to the part is 10 mA.  \n04351-0-020C1\n6pFC2\n20pFR1D1\nD2VDD\nVIN\n \nFigure 23. Equivalent Analog Input Circuit \nThe capacitor C1 in Figure 23 is typically about 6 pF and can \nprimarily be attributed to pin capacitance. The resistor R1 is \na lumped component made up of the on resistance of the track-and-hold switch and also includes the on resistance of \nthe input multiplexer. This resistor is typically about 100 Ω. \nThe capacitor C2 is the ADC sampling capacitor and has a \ncapacitance of 20 pF typically.  \nFor ac applications, removing high frequency components from \nthe analog input signal is recommended using a band-pass filter \non the relevant analog input pin. In applications where har-monic distortion and signal-to-noise ratio are critical, the analog input should be driven from a low impedance source. Large source impedances can significantly affect the ac \nperformance of the ADC. This might necessitate the use of an \ninput buffer amplifier. The choice of the op amp is a function of \nthe particular application. \n AD7912/AD7922\n \nRev. 0 | Page 17 of 32 Table 7 provides some typical performance data with various \nop amps used as the input buffer, and a 50 kHz input tone under \nthe same setup conditions. \nTable 7.

The maximum \nsource impedance depends on the amount of total harmonic distortion (THD) that can be tolerated. The THD increases as \nthe source impedance increases and performance degrades (see \nFigure 16). \nDIGITAL INPUTS \nThe digital inputs applied to the AD7912/AD7922 are not \nlimited by the maximum ratings that limit the analog input. \nInstead, the digital inputs applied can go to 7 V and are not restricted by the V\nDD + 0.3 V limit as on the analog input. For \nexample, if the AD7912/AD7922 are operated with a V DD of 3 V , \nthen 5 V logic levels could be used on the digital inputs. How-ever, it is important to note that the data output on DOUT still has 3 V logic levels when V\nDD = 3 V . Another advantage of \nSCLK, DIN, and CS not being restricted by the V DD + 0.3 V limit \nis that power supply sequencing issues are avoided. If CS, DIN, \nor SCLK are applied before V DD, then there is no risk of latch-up \nas there would be on the analog inputs if a signal greater than \n0.3 V were applied prior to V DD. \nDIN INPUT \nThe channel to be converted on in the next conversion is \nselected by writing to the DIN pin. Data on the DIN pin is \nloaded into the AD7912/AD7922 on  the falling edge of SCLK. \nThe data is transferred into the part on the DIN pin at the same time that the conversion result is read from the part. Only the third and fourth bits of the DIN word are used; the rest are \nignored by the ADC. \nThe third MSB is the channel identifier bit, which identifies the \nchannel to be converted on in the next conversion, \nV\nIN0 (CHN = 0) or V IN1 (CHN = 1). The fourth MSB, STY , is related to the mode of operation of the \ndevice. To keep the AD7912/ AD7922 in daisy-chain mode, the \nCHN and STY bits have to be inverted during the conversions (STY ≠ CHN). A conversion with STY = CHN on the input \nforces the device to normal mode in the next cycle. See the \nDaisy-Chain Mode section for more details. \nIf the AD7912/AD7922 are not going to be used in daisy-chain \nmode, it is recommended to keep STY and CHN the same \n(STY = CHN). In that case, the channel can be selected by tying \nDIN either high or low during a conversion cycle. \nTo summarize: \nCHN = 0 , Channel 0 selected for next conversion. \nCHN = 1 , Channel 1 selected for next conversion. \nCHN = STY , forces normal mode in the next cycle. \nCHN ≠ STY , keeps the AD7912/AD7922 in daisy-chain mode. \n04351-0-021LSB MSB\nX X CHN STY DON'T CARE \nFigure 24.

AD7912/AD7922 DOUT Word \n \nAD7912/AD7922 \n \nRev. 0 | Page 18 of 32 MODES OF OPERATION \nThe three modes of operation of the AD7912/AD7922 are \nnormal mode, power-down mode, and daisy-chain mode. The \nmode of operation is selected by controlling the logic state of \nthe CS signal. The point at which CS is pulled high after the \nconversion has been initiated determines whether the \nAD7912/AD7922 enter power-down mode or change to daisy-\nchain mode. Similarly, if already in daisy-chain mode, CS can \ncontrol whether the device returns to normal operation or \nenters power-down mode. The user can also change from daisy-\nchain mode to normal mode by writing to the DIN pin, as \noutlined in the DIN Input section. \nPower-down mode is designed to provide flexible power \nmanagement options and to optimize the ratio of power \ndissipation to throughput rate for different application \nrequirements. \nDaisy-chain mode is intended for applications where fast \nthroughput rate is not required and more than one \nAD7912/AD7922 have been connected in a daisy chain, as \nshown in Figure 33. \nNORMAL MODE \nNormal mode is intended for the fastest throughput rate \nperformance. The user does not have to worry about any \npower-up time, because the AD7912/AD7922 remain fully powered all the time. Figure 26 shows the operation of the \nAD7912/AD7922 in this mode. \nThe conversion is initiated on the falling edge of CS\n as \ndescribed in the Serial Interface section. To ensure that the part \nremains fully powered up at all times, CS must remain low until \nat least 10 SCLK falling edges have elapsed after the falling edge of CS\n. If CS is brought high after the 10th SCLK falling edge \nand before the 12th SCLK falling edge, then the device enters \ndaisy-chain mode, as shown in Figure 27. The conversion is \nterminated and DOUT goes back into three-state. If CS is \nbrought high after the 13th SCLK falling edge, but before the \nend of t CONVERT , the conversion is terminated and DOUT goes \nback into three-state, but the part remains in normal mode. \nFor the AD7922, 16 serial clock cycles are required to complete \nthe conversion and access the complete conversion result. For \nthe AD7912, a minimum of 14 serial clock cycles are required \nto complete the conversion and access the complete \nconversion result. CS can idle high until the next conversion or can idle low until \nCS returns high sometime prior to the next conversion \n(effectively idling CS low). Once a data transfer is complete \n(DOUT has returned to three-state), another conversion can be \ninitiated after the quiet time, t QUIET , has elapsed by bringing CS \nlow again. \nPOWER-DOWN MODE \nPower-down mode is intended for use in applications where \nslower throughput rates are required. Either the ADC is \npowered down between each conversion, or a series of conversions can be performed at a high throughput rate and \nthen the ADC is powered down for a relatively long duration \nbetween these bursts of several conversions. When the AD7912/ AD7922 are in power-down mode, all analog circuitry is \npowered down. \nTo enter power-down mode, the conversion process must be \ninterrupted by bringing CS\n high any time after the second \nfalling edge of SCLK and before the 10th falling edge of SCLK, \nas shown in Figure 28. Once CS has been brought high in this \nwindow of SCLKs, then the part enters power-down mode, the conversion that was initiated by the falling edge of CS\n is termi-\nnated, and DOUT goes back into three-state. If CS is brought \nhigh before the second SCLK falling edge, then the part remains \nin normal mode and does not power down. This helps to avoid \naccidental power-down due to glitches on the CS line. \nTo exit this mode of operation and power the AD7912/AD7922 \nup again, a dummy conversion is performed. On the falling edge \nof CS, the device begins to power up and continues to power up \nas long as CS is held low until after the falling edge of the \n10th SCLK. The device is fully powered up once 16 SCLKs have \nelapsed and valid data results from the next conversion, as \nshown in Figure 29. If CS is brought high before the 10th falling \nedge of SCLK, then the AD791 2/AD7922 go back into power- \ndown mode. This helps to avoid accidental power-up due to glitches on the CS\n line or an inadvertent burst of 8 SCLK cycles \nwhile CS is low. Therefore, although the device might begin to \npower up on the falling edge of CS, it powers down again on the \nrising edge of CS, as long as this occurs before the 10th SCLK \nfalling edge. \n AD7912/AD7922\n \nRev. 0 | Page 19 of 32  \n04351-0-023CS\n1 10 12 14 16 1 10 12 14 16AD7912/AD7922\nSCLK\nDIN\nDOUTCHANNEL FOR NEXT CONVERSION CHANNEL FOR NEXT CONVERSION\nCONVERSION RESULT CONVERSION RESULT\n \nFigure 26.

Exiting Power-Down Mode \n \n  \nAD7912/AD7922 \n \nRev. 0 | Page 20 of 32 POWER-UP TIME \nThe power-up time of the AD7912/AD7922 is 1 µs, which \nmeans that with any frequency of SCLK up to 18 MHz, one \ndummy cycle is always sufficient to allow the device to power up. Once the dummy cycle is complete, the ADC is fully \npowered up and the input signal is fully acquired. The quiet \ntime, t\nQUIET , must still be allowed from the point at which the \nbus goes back into three-state after the dummy conversion to \nthe next falling edge of CS. When running at a 1 MSPS \nthroughput rate, the AD7912/AD7922 power up and acquire a \nsignal within ±1 LSB in one dummy cycle, that is, 1 µs. \nWhen powering up from power-down mode with a dummy \ncycle, as in Figure 29, the track-and-hold that was in hold mode \nwhile the part was powered down returns to track mode on the fifth SCLK falling edge that the part receives after the falling \nedge of CS\n. This is shown as point A in Figure 29. At this point, \nthe part starts to acquire the signal on the channel selected in \nthe current dummy conversion. \nAlthough at any SCLK frequency one dummy cycle is sufficient \nto power up the device and acquire V IN, it does not necessarily \nmean that a full dummy cycle of 16 SCLKs must always elapse to power up the device and acquire V\nIN fully. 1 µs is sufficient to \npower up the device and acquire the input signal. For example, \nif a 5 MHz SCLK frequency was applied to the ADC, the cycle time would be 3.2 µs. In one dummy cycle, 3.2 µs, the part would be powered up and V\nIN acquired fully. However, after 1 µs \nwith a 5 MHz SCLK, only five SCLK cycles would have elapsed. \nAt this stage, the ADC would be fully powered up and the signal \nis acquired. Therefore, in this case, CS can be brought high after \nthe 10th SCLK falling edge. If CS is brought high anytime after \nthe 13th SCLK falling edge, the part enters normal mode for the next conversion. CS\n has to be brought low again after a time, \ntQUIET , to initiate the conversion. However, if CS is brought high \nanytime after the 10th and before the 12th SCLK falling edge, \nthe part enters daisy-chain mode. \nWhen power supplies are first applied to the AD7912/AD7922, \nthe ADC can power up in either power-down mode, normal \nmode, or daisy-chain mode. Because of this, it is best to allow a \ndummy cycle to elapse to ensure that the part is fully powered up before attempting a valid conversion. Likewise, if the user wants to keep the part in power-down mode while not in use and to power up in power-down mode, then the dummy cycle \ncan be used to ensure that the device is in power-down mode by \nexecuting a cycle such as that shown in Figure 28.  \nOnce supplies are applied to the AD7912/AD7922, the power-\nup time is the same as when powering up from the power-down \nmode. It takes the part approximately 1 µs to power up fully in \nnormal mode. It is not necessary to wait 1 µs before executing a dummy cycle to ensure the desired mode of operation. Instead, the dummy cycle can occur directly after power is supplied to the ADC. If the first valid conversion is then performed directly after the dummy conversion, care must be taken to ensure that adequate acquisition time has been allowed. When the ADC powers up initially after supplies are applied, the track-and-hold \nis in hold. It returns to track on the fifth SCLK falling edge that \nthe part receives after the falling edge of CS\n. \nDAISY-CHAIN MODE \nWhen the ADC is in this mode of operation, the part operates \nas a shift register. This mode is intended for applications where \nmore than one ADC is used, connected in a daisy-chain \nconfiguration (see Figure 33). All ADCs are addressed by the \nsame CS signal and the same serial clock. The conversion result \nstored in the internal shift register in each ADC is shifted from \none device to the following in the chain. See the Daisy-Chain \nExample in the following section for more details. \nTo enter daisy-chain mode, the conversion process must be \ninterrupted by bringing CS high after the 10th falling edge of \nSCLK and before the 12th falling edge of SCLK, as shown in \nFigure 27. To ensure that the AD7912/AD7922 are placed into \ndaisy-chain mode, CS should not be brought high until at \nleast 20 ns after the 10th SCLK falling edge and before the 12th SCLK falling edge. Once CS\n has been brought high in \nthis window of SCLKs, the part enters daisy-chain mode, the conversion that was initiated by the falling edge of CS\n is \nterminated, and DOUT goes back into three-state.  \nIf CS is brought high between the 10th and the 12th SCLK \nfalling edge, the part enters daisy-chain mode and the data \nshifted from one ADC to the next one in the chain is valid data \n(see Figure 34 and Figure 35). If CS is brought high between the \n12th and the 13th SCLK falling edge, the part enters daisy-chain \nmode, but the data shifted in the chain is invalid data. \nTo keep the part in daisy-chain mode, the CHN and STY bits in \nthe DIN word must be inverted relative to each other in each \n16 SCLKs cycle. A conversion with the CHN and STY bits set to the same value in the DIN word while the device is in daisy-chain mode forces the part to go back into normal mode in the \nnext cycle, as shown in Figure 30. \nTo exit this mode of operation, the user can perform a dummy \ncycle or can set the STY bit to the CHN bit value on the DIN \nword during a conversion cycle. When performing a dummy \nconversion to exit this mode, CS\n must be brought high anytime \nafter the 10th SCLK falling edge and before the 13th SCLK \nfalling edge, as shown in Figure 31. The device enters normal \nmode, and valid data from the channel selected in the dummy \ncycle results in the next conversion. \nFigure 32 summarizes the modes of operation, how to change \nbetween modes, the values for the bits in the DIN and DOUT \nwords in different modes, and in the transitions between modes. \n AD7912/AD7922\n \nRev. 0 | Page 21 of 32 \n04351-0-028CS\n1 10 12 14 16 1 10 12 14 16\nSCLK\nDIN\nDOUTCH = STY CHANNEL FOR NEXT CONVERSIONDAISY-CHAIN CYCLE NORMAL MODE\nVALID DATA CONVERSION RESULT\n \nFigure 30.

Transitions between Modes of Operation \n \n \nAD7912/AD7922 \n \nRev. 0 | Page 22 of 32 DAISY-CHAIN EXAMPLE \nIn applications where fast throughput is not critical, connecting \nseveral ADCs in a daisy chain lets the user perform simultane-\nous sampling on all the ADCs contained in the chain using the \nminimum number of I/O lines from the µC/DSP ports. \nThe user needs to alternate modes of operation in the ADCs. \nWhile the parts are in normal mode, the conversion is per-\nformed and the result from each ADC is stored in its internal register. Following the conversion, the parts are placed into \ndaisy-chain mode and the user can proceed to read the result \nfrom each ADC by shifting the data from one ADC to the next. \nFor clarity in the following example, only two devices are \nconnected in a daisy chain. Both AD7912/AD7922 are \naddressed by the same CS\n and SCLK signal. The devices are \nconfigured as shown in Figure 33 for simultaneous conversion \nand shifting read operation later. The output of the device on \nthe left, ADC1, feeds the input of the device on the right, ADC2. \nDuring a normal conversion, the conversion result is stored \ninternally and output to the DOUT pin. In daisy-chain mode, \nthe value internally stored is output through the DOUT pin and the information provided at the DIN pin is shifted into the \ninternal register. \nWhen several AD7912/AD7922 are connected in a daisy chain, \nthe sequence is as follows: \n1.\n Normal conversion. \nEvery AD7912/AD7922 performs a conversion on its \nselected channel and the result is stored in the internal shift \nregister. \n2. Entering daisy-chain mode. \nIn this cycle, CS is brought high between the 10th and \n12th SCLK falling edges and all the devices enter daisy-chain mode. \n3.\n Daisy-chain cycles. \nWhile the AD7912/AD7922 are in daisy-chain mode, the \nconversion results from all the devices in the chain are \nread, and the parts are configured for the next conversion. \nThe user needs to perform as many read cycles as there are \ndevices in the chain. To keep all the AD7912/AD7922 in \ndaisy-chain mode, the CHN and STY bits in the DIN input must always be inverted. Data is shifted through the devices in the chain. Data is clocked into the device in the chain by the same clock used to clock data out. The first \nword clocked into the DIN pin once the devices are in \ndaisy-chain mode is eventually lost. The second word clocked into the DIN pin contains the channel configura-tion data for the last device in the chain, the third word clocked into the DIN pin contains the channel configura-tion data for the second last device in the chain, and so on. Then the selected channel for the first device in the chain is clocked in the cycle executed after all the data has been \nread, that is, in the short cycle used to change modes of \noperation. See Figure 34. \n4.\n Enter normal mode. \nAfter reading the conversion results from the AD7912/ \nAD7922, the devices need to be placed into normal mode \nto perform a new conversion. Therefore, in this cycle CS is \nbrought high between the 10th and the 13th SCLK falling \nedge. The DOUT line contains invalid data and DIN contains the selected channel for the first device in the chain. The remaining devices in the chain have already set \nthe channel for the next conversion as a result of the data \nshifted in during daisy-chain mode. \n5.\n Normal conversion. \nA new conversion can be performed on the newly selected \nchannels. The process can be repeated by following the \nprevious steps. \nFigure 34 shows the timing diagram for two AD7912/ \nAD7922 connected in a daisy chain, as shown in Figure 33. \nThe DIN signal corresponds to the DIN pin on the first AD7912/AD7922 in the chain, and the DOUT signal corresponds to the DOUT pin on the last AD7912/AD7922 in the chain. The words clocked into the DIN pin, which set up the channel for the next conversion for the two \nAD7912/AD7922, are shown as COMMAND1 and \nCOMMAND2. The first word clocked in, COMMAND3, does not remain in any of the ADCs in the chain and is eventually lost. The channel configuration data for the first device in the chain, COMMAND1, is clocked in while changing from daisy-chain mode to normal mode. \nFigure 35 is a more detailed diagram that shows the data \npresented on the DIN pin and clocked out on the DOUT pin for each of the AD7912/AD7922 in Figure 33.

THROUGHPUT RATE \nBy using the power-down mode on the AD7912/AD7922 when \nnot converting, the average power consumption of the ADC \ndecreases at lower throughput rates. Figure 36 shows how, as the throughput rate is reduced, the device remains in its power-down state longer and the average power consumption over \ntime drops. \nFor example, if the AD7912/AD7922 are operating in a continu-\nous sampling mode with a throughput rate of 100 kSPS and a \nSCLK of 18 MHz (V\nDD = 5 V), and the devices are placed in the \npower-down mode between conversions, then the power consumption is calculated as follows. The power dissipation during normal operation is 20 mW (V\nDD = 5 V). If the power-up \ntime is one dummy cycle (1 µs), and the remaining conversion time is another cycle (1 µs), then the AD7912/AD7922 dissipate 20 mW for 2 µs during each conversion cycle. If the throughput \nrate is 100 kSPS and the cycle time is 10 µs, then the average \npower dissipated during each cycle is  \n(2/10) × (20 mW) = 4 mW \nIf V\nDD = 3 V , SCLK = 18 MHz, and the device is again in power-\ndown mode between conversions, then the power dissipation \nduring normal operation is 6 mW . The AD7912/AD7922 now dissipate 6 mW for 2 µs during each conversion cycle. With a \nthroughput rate of 100 kSPS, the average power dissipated \nduring each cycle is  \n(2/10) × (6 mW) = 1.2 mW In the previous calculations, the power dissipation when the \npart is in power-down mode has not been taken into account. \nBy placing the parts into power-down mode between conver-sions, the average power consumed by the ADC decreases as the throughput rate decreases, because the ADC remains in a \npower-down state for a longer time. \nFigure 36 shows the power consumption versus throughput rate \nwhen using the power-down mode between conversions with \nboth 5 V and 3 V supplies. \nPower-down mode is intended for use with throughput rates of \napproximately 330 kSPS and under, because at higher sampling \nrates the short time spent in power-down does not affect the \naverage power consumed by the ADC. \n100\n0.010.1110\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n04351-0-033\nTHROUGHPUT (kSPS)POWER (mW)VDD = 5V, SCLK = 18MHz\nVDD = 3V, SCLK = 18MHz\n \nFigure 36.

The \nserial clock provides the conversion clock and also controls the transfer of information from the AD7912/AD7922 during \nconversion. \nThe CS\n signal initiates the data transfer and conversion process. \nThe falling edge of CS puts the track-and-hold into hold mode, \ntakes the bus out of three-state. The analog input is sampled at \nthis point and the conversion is initiated. \nFor the AD7922, the conversion requires 16 SCLK cycles to \ncomplete. Once 13 SCLK falling edges have elapsed, the track-\nand-hold goes back into track on the next SCLK rising edge, as \nshown in Figure 37 at Point B. On the 16th SCLK falling edge, the DOUT line goes back into three-state. If the rising edge of CS\n occurs before 16 SCLKs have elapsed, then the conversion is \nterminated and the DOUT line goes back into three-state. Otherwise, DOUT returns to three-state on the 16th SCLK falling edge, as shown in Figure 37. Sixteen serial clock cycles \nare required to perform the conversion process and to access \ndata from the AD7922. \nFor the AD7912, the conversion requires 14 SCLK cycles to \ncomplete. Once 13 SCLK falling edges have elapsed, the track-\nand-hold goes back into track on the next SCLK rising edge, as \nshown in Figure 38 at Point B. If the rising edge of CS\n occurs before 14 SCLKs have elapsed, \nthen the conversion is terminated and the DOUT line goes back \ninto three-state. If 16 SCLKs are considered in the cycle, DOUT \nreturns to three-state on the 16th SCLK falling edge, as shown \nin Figure 38. \nCS going low clocks out the first leading zero to be read in by \nthe microcontroller or DSP . The remaining data is then clocked \nout by subsequent SCLK falling edges beginning with the \nsecond leading zero. Therefore, the first falling clock edge on \nthe serial clock has the first leading zero provided and also clocks out the second leading zero. The final bit in the data transfer is valid on the 16th falling edge, having been clocked \nout on the previous (15th) falling edge. \nIn applications with a slower SCLK, it is possible to read in data \non each SCLK rising edge. In that case, the first falling edge of \nSCLK clocks out the second leading zero and it can be read in the first rising edge. However, the first leading zero that is \nclocked out when CS\n goes low is missed, unless it is read on the \nfirst falling SCLK edge. The 15th falling edge of SCLK clocks \nout the last bit and it can be read in the 15th rising SCLK edge. \nIf CS goes low just after the SCLK falling edge has elapsed, CS \nclocks out the first leading zero as before and it can be read in \nthe SCLK rising edge. The next SCLK falling edge clocks out the second leading zero and it can be read in the following rising edge. \n04351-0-034ZERO\nX12345 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6\nX CHN STY X X X X XCHN MOD DB11 DB10 DB2 DB1 DB0 Zt2 t6\nt4\nt8 t9t3t7t5 t10t1\ntQUIETtCONVERT\nSCLKCS\nDOUT\nTHREE-STATE THREE-STATE\nDINB\n \nFigure 37.

This \nsection explains how to interface the AD7912/AD7922 with some of the more common microcontroller and DSP serial interface protocols. \nAD7912/AD7922 to TMS320C541 Interface \nThe serial interface on the TMS320C541 uses a continuous \nserial clock and frame synchronization signals to synchronize \nthe data transfer operations with peripheral devices like the \nAD7912/AD7922. The CS input allows easy interfacing between \nthe TMS320C541 and the AD7912/AD7922 without any glue \nlogic required. The serial port of the TMS320C541 is set up to \noperate in burst mode (FSM = 1 in the serial port control \nregister, SPC) with the internal serial clock CLKX (MCM = 1 in the SPC register) and the internal frame signal (TXM = 1 in the SPC register); therefore, both pins are configured as outputs. For the AD7922, the word length should be set to 16 bits (FO = 0 in \nthe SPC register). This DSP allows frames with a word length of \n16 bits or 8 bits only. In the AD7912, therefore, where 14 bits are required, the FO bit should be set up to 16 bits, and 16 SCLKs are needed. For the AD7912, two trailing zeros are clocked out \nin the last two clock cycles. \nThe values in the SPC register are as follows: FO = 0 \nFSM = 1 \nMCM = 1 \nTXM = 1 \nTo implement the power-down mode on the AD7912/AD7922, \nthe format bit, FO, can be set to 1, which sets the word length to \n8 bits. \nThe connection diagram is shown in Figure 39. Note that, for \nsignal processing applications, the frame synchronization signal \nfrom the TMS320C541 must provide equidistant sampling. \nAD7912/\nAD7922*TMS320C541*\nCLKX\nDR\nFSX\nFSRSCLK\nDOUT\nCSCLKR\nDX DIN\n04351-0-036\n*ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY \nFigure 39. Interfacing to the TMS320C541 AD7912/AD7922 to ADSP-218x \nThe ADSP-218x family of DSPs are interfaced directly to the \nAD7912/AD7922 without any glue logic required. The SPORT control register should be set up as follows: \nTFSW = RFSW = 1, alternate framing \nINVRFS = INVTFS = 1, active low frame signal \nDTYPE = 00, right-justify data \nISCLK = 1, internal serial clock TFSR = RFSR = 1, frame every word IRFS = 0, set up RFS as an input ITFS = 1, set up TFS as an output \nSLEN = 1111, 16 bits for the AD7922 \nSLEN = 1101, 14 bits for the AD7912 \nTo implement the power-down mode, SLEN should be set to \n0111 to issue an 8-bit SCLK burst. The connection diagram is \nshown in Figure 40. The ADSP-218x has the TFS and RFS of the \nSPORT tied together, with TFS set as an output and RFS set as an input. The DSP operates in alternate framing mode and the SPORT control register is set up as described previously. The \nframe synchronization signal generated on the TFS is tied to CS\n \nand, as with all signal processing applications, equidistant \nsampling is necessary. However, in this example, the timer \ninterrupt is used to control the sampling rate of the ADC and, \nunder certain conditions, equidistant sampling might not be \nachieved. \nAD7912/\nAD7922*ADSP-218x*\nSCLK\nRFS\nTFSSCLK\nCSDR DOUT\nDT DIN\n04351-0-037\n*ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY \nFigure 40. Interfacing to the ADSP-218x \nThe timer registers are loaded with a value that provides an \ninterrupt at the required sample interval. When an interrupt is \nreceived, a value is transmitted with TFS/DT (ADC control word). The TFS is used to control the RFS and, therefore, the reading of data. The frequency of the serial clock is set in the \nSCLKDIV register. When the instruction to transmit with TFS \nis given, that is, TX0 = AX0, the state of the SCLK is checked. The DSP waits until the SCLK has gone high, low, and high again before transmission starts. If the timer and SCLK values are chosen such that the instruction to transmit occurs on or \nnear the rising edge of SCLK, the data might be transmitted or \nit might wait until the next clock edge. \n AD7912/AD7922\n \nRev. 0 | Page 27 of 32 For example, the ADSP-2189 has a master clock frequency of \n40 MHz. If the SCLKDIV register is loaded with the value of 3, \nthen an SCLK of 5 MHz is obtained, and eight master clock periods elapse for every one SCLK period. Depending on the throughput rate selected, if the timer register is loaded with the value 803 (803 + 1 = 804), then 100.5 SCLK occur between \ninterrupts and subsequently between transmit instructions. This \nsituation results in nonequidistant sampling, because the transmit instruction occurs on a SCLK edge. If the number of SCLKs between interrupts is a whole integer figure of N, then \nequidistant sampling is implemented by the DSP . \nAD7912/AD7922 to DSP563xx Interface \nThe connection diagram in Figure 41 shows how the AD7912/ \nAD7922 can be connected to the SSI (synchronous serial \ninterface) of the DSP563xx family of DSPs from Motorola. The \nSSI is operated in synchronous and normal mode (SYN = 1 and \nMOD = 0 in the Control Register B, CRB) with internally generated word frame sync for both Tx and Rx (Bits FSL1 = 0 and FSL0 = 0 in the CRB). Set the word length in the Control Register A (CRA) to 16 by setting bits WL2 = 0, WL1 = 1, and \nWL0 = 0 for the AD7922. This DSP does not offer the option for \na 14-bit word length, so the AD7912 word length is set up to 16 bits like the AD7922. For the AD7912, the conversion process uses 16 SCLK cycles, with the last two clock periods clocking \nout two trailing zeros to fill the 16-bit word. \nTo implement the power-down mode on the AD7912/AD7922, \nthe word length can be changed to 8 bits by setting Bits \nWL2 = 0, WL1 = 0, and WL0 = 0 in CRA. The FSP bit in the CRB register can be set to 1, which means that the frame goes low and a conversion starts. Likewise, by means of the Bits SCD2, SCKD, and SHFD in the CRB register, the Pin SC2 (the frame sync signal) and SCK in the serial port are configured as \noutputs, and the MSB is shifted first. \nThe values are as follows: MOD = 0 \nSYN = 1 \nWL2, WL1, WL0 depend on the word length FSL1 = 0, FSL0 = 0 FSP = 1, negative frame sync SCD2 = 1 \nSCKD = 1 \nSHFD = 0 \nNote that, for signal processing applications, the frame \nsynchronization signal from the DSP563xx must provide equidistant sampling. \nAD7912/\nAD7922*DSP563xx*\nSCK SCLK\nSRD DOUT\nSTD DIN\nSC2 CS\n04351-0-038\n*ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY \nFigure 41.

This facilitates the use of ground planes that can be separated easily. \nA minimum etch technique is generally best for ground planes, \nbecause it gives the best shielding. Digital and analog ground planes should be joined at only one place. If the AD7912/ AD7922 are in a system where multiple devices require an AGND-to-DGND connection, the connection should still be made at one point only, a star ground point that should be established as close as possible to the AD7912/AD7922.  \nAvoid running digital lines under the device, because these \ncouple noise onto the die. The analog ground plane should be allowed to run under the AD7912/AD7922 to avoid noise \ncoupling. The power supply lines to the AD7912/AD7922 should use as large a trace as possible to provide low impedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast-switching signals like clocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board, and clock signals should never be run near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Traces on opposite \nsides of the board should run at right angles to each other to \nreduce the effects of feedthrough through the board. A micro-strip technique is by far the best, but is not always possible with a double-sided board. In this technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to ground planes, while signals are placed on the solder side.  \nGood decoupling is also very important. The analog supply \nshould be decoupled with 10 µF tantalum in parallel with 0.1 µF \ncapacitors to AGND. To achieve the best performance from \nthese decoupling components, the user should endeavor to keep \nthe distance between the decoupling capacitor and the V\nDD and \nGND pins to a minimum with short track lengths connecting \nthe respective pins.  \n \n AD7912/AD7922\n \nRev. 0 | Page 29 of 32 EVALUATING AD7912/AD7922 PERFORMANCE \nThe evaluation board package includes a fully assembled and \ntested evaluation board, documentation, and software for \ncontrolling the board from a PC via the EVAL-CONTROL \nBRD2.  \nThe EV AL-CONTROL BRD2 can be used in conjunction with \nthe AD7912CB/AD7922CB evaluation board, as well as many \nother Analog Devices evaluation boards ending in the CB designator to demonstrate and evaluate the ac and dc \nperformance of the AD7912/AD7922.
