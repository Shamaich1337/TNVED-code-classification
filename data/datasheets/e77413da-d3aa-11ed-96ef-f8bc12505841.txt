The ADXL1001 /ADXL1002  have high g ranges of 100 g \nand 50 g  and are suitable for vibration measurements in high \nbandwidth applications such as vibration analysis systems that monitor and diagnose machine or system health.  \nThe low noise and high frequency bandwidth allows the \nmeasurement of vibration patterns caused by small moving \nparts, such as internal bearings, and the high g range provides \nthe dynamic range to be used in high vibration environments such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HV AC) and \nheavy machine equipment. To achieve proper performance, be \naware of system noise, mounting, and signal conditioning.  \nSystem noise is affected by supply voltage noise. The analog \noutput of the ADXL1001 /ADXL1002  is a ratiometric output; \ntherefore, supply voltage modulation affects the output. Use a properly decoupled stable supply voltage to power the ADXL1001 / \nADXL1002  and to provide a reference voltage for the digitizing \nsystem. \nThe output signal is impacted by an overrange stimulus. An \noverload indicator output feature is provided to indicate a condition that is critical for an intelligent measurement system. For more information about the overrange features, see the \nOverrange section. \nProper mounting is required to ensure full mechanical transfer \nof vibration to accurately measure the desired vibration rather \nthan vibration of the measurement system, including the sensor. \nA common technique for high frequency mechanical coupling is to utilize a sensor stud mount system while considering the mechanical interface of fixing the ADXL1001 /ADXL1002  in the \nstud. For lower frequencies (below the full capable bandwidth of the sensor), it is possible to use magnetic or adhesive \nmounting. Proper mounting technique ensures proper and \nrepeatable results that are not influenced by measurement system mechanical resonances and/or damping at the desired frequency, and represents an efficient and proper mechanical \ntransfer to the system being monitored. \nProper application specific signal conditioning is require to \nachieve optimal results. An understanding of measurement \nfrequency range and managing overload condition is important \nto achieve accurate results. The electrical output signal of the ADXL1001 /ADXL1002  requires some band limiting and proper \ndigitization bandwidth. See the Interfacing Analog Output Below 10 kHz section and the Interfacing Analog Output Beyond 10 kHz section for more information. \n MECHANICAL DEVICE OPERATION \nThe moving component of the sensor is a polysilicon surface-\nmicromachined structure built on top of a silicon wafer. \nPolysilicon springs suspend the structure over the surface of the \nwafer and provide a resistance against acceleration forces. \nDeflection of the structure is measured using differential \ncapacitors that consist of independent fixed plates and plates \nattached to the moving mass. Acceleration deflects the structure \nand unbalances the differential capacitor, resulting in a sensor output with an amplitude proportional to acceleration. Phase-sensitive demodulation determines the magnitude and polarity \nof the acceleration. \nOPERATING MODES \nThe ADXL1001 /ADXL1002  have two operating modes: \nmeasurement mode and standby mode. Measurement mode \nprovides a continuous analog output for active monitoring. Standby mode is a nonoperational, low power mode.  \nMeasurement Mode \nMeasurement mode is the normal operating mode of the \nADXL1001 /ADXL1002 . In this mode, the accelerometer \nactively measures acceleration along the axis of sensitivity and \nconsumes 1.0 mA (typical) using a 5.0 V supply. \nStandby \nPlacing the ADXL1001 /ADXL1002  in standby mode suspends \nthe measurement with internal reduction of current consumption to 225 μA (typical for 5.0 V supply). The transition time from \nstandby to measurement mode is <50 μs. The transition from \nstandby to measure mode is shown in Figure 18. \nBANDWIDTH \nThe ADXL1001 /ADXL1002  circuitry supports an output signal \nbandwidth beyond the resonant frequency of the sensor, \nmeasuring acceleration over a bandwidth comparable to the resonant frequency of the sensor. The output response is a combination of the sensor response and the output amplifier response. Therefore, external band limiting or filtering is \nrequired; see the Interfacing Analog Output Below 10 kHz \nsection and the Interfacing Analog Output Beyond 10 kHz \nsection for more information. \nWhen using the ADXL1001 /ADXL1002  beyond 10 kHz, \nconsider the nonlinearity due to the resonance frequency of the \nsensor, the additional noise due to the wideband output of the amplifier, and the discrete frequency spurious tone due to coupling \nof the internal 200 kHz clock. Aliased interferers in the desired \nband cannot be removed, and observed performance degrades. A combination of high speed sampling and appropriate band \nlimiting filtering is required for optimal performance.  \n \nADXL1001/ADXL1002 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 10 of 14 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nAPPLICATION CIRCUIT  \nFor most applications, a single 1  µF capacitor adequately \ndecouples the accelerometer from noise on the power sup ply. A \nband limiting filter at the output provides suppression of out of \nband noise and signal. A capacitive load between 100  pF and \n22 nF is recommended.  \nThe output amplifier can drive resistive loads up to 2 mA of  source \ncurrent, for example greater tha n 2.5 kΩ for 5 V operation. If \nthe output is to drive a capacitive load greater than or equal to 100 pF, a series resistor of at least 8  kΩ is required to maintain \nthe amplifier stability.  \nWhen inactive, the ST and STANDBY pins are forced low. The overrang e indicator is an output that can be monitored to \nidentify the status of the system.  \n \nFigure 22.

This function electrostatically \nactuates the accelerometer proof mass, resulting in a  displacement \nof the capacitive sense fingers. This displacement is equivalent \nto the displacement that occurs as a result of external  acceleration \ninput. The proof mass displacement is processed by the same \nsignal processing circuitry as a true acceleration output signal, \nproviding complete coverage of both the electrical and  mechanical \nresponses of the sensor system.  \n \n \n The self test feature can be exercised by the user with the \nfollowing steps:  \n1. Measure the output voltage.  \n2. Turn on self  test by setting the ST pin to VDD. \n3. Measure the output again.  \n4. Subtract the two readings and compare the result to the \nexpected value from Table 1, while factoring in the \nresponse curve du e to supply voltage , if necessary , from \nFigure 23. \nThe self test  function can be activated at any point during \nnormal operation by setting the ST pin to VDD. Self test takes \napproximately 300 µs from the assertion of the ST pin to a \nresult, and acceleration outputs return approximately 300 µs \nafter the release of the S T pin. While performing the self test \nmeasurement, do not use the accelerometer output to measure external acceleration.  \n \nFigure 23. ADXL1002  Typical S elf Test D elta  vs. Supply Voltage  \nRATIOMETRIC OUTPUT V OLTAGE  \nThe ADXL1001/ ADXL1002 are tested and specified at VDD = \n5.0 V; howe ver, it can be powered with VDD as low as 3.3  V or as \nhigh as 5.25 V . Some performance parameters change as the supply voltage is varied.  \nThe ADXL1001/ ADXL1002  output is ratiometric to the supply \nvoltage V\nDD; therefore, the output sensitivity (or scale factor) \nvaries proportionally to the supply voltage. At VDD = 5.0 V , the \noutput sensitivity is typically 40 mV/ g and 20 mV/ g in the \nADXL1002 and ADXL1001, respectively.  \nThe zero g  bias output is ratiometr ic also and is nominally \nmidscale relative to the supply voltage (VDD/2). 24\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n18\n171\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nVDD\n(3.3V TO 5.25V\nSUPP LY VOLTAGE)\nSTANDB Y (ACTIVE HIGH)ST (ACTIVE HIGH)VOUTR\n1µFC\nVSS\nADXL1001/\nADXL100232 31 30 29 26 25\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 1628 27\nOROPTIONA L\nLOW-PASS FI LTER\n15431-0210100200300400500600700\n3.3 3.5 4.1 4.7 3.7 4.3 4.9 3.9 4.5 5.1 5.3TYPICAL SELFTESTDELTA (mV)\nSUPPLYVOLTAGE (V)\n15431-022ADXL1002\nADXL1001\nData Sheet  ADXL1001/ADXL1002 \n \nRev. 0 | Page 11 of 14 \n  \nFigure 24. ADXL1002  Sensitivity vs. Supply Voltage  \nINTERFACING ANALOG OUTPUT BELOW 10 kHz \nThe ADXL1001/ ADXL1002  sense mechanical motion along a \nsingle axis and produces a voltage output. The system \nperformance depends on the output response that is a result of mechanical vibration sensed and signal processing of the \nelectrical output.  \nThe sensor must be effectively mechanically coupled . Mechanical \ncoupling can be a complex integration of multiple components, \ntypically unique for each application. Consideration must be \nmade for all mechanical interfaces including the mounting of the MEMS to the PCB (location on the PCB as well as solder chemistry), the size of the PCB (both thickness and active \nsurface area), and the mounting of the PCB to the system being \nmonitored (either in a module or directly mounted).  \nIn general,  the following  guidelines for effective mechanical \ninterface must be u sed to support up to 10 kHz bandwidth:  \n• Keep the ADXL1001/ ADXL1002 near a stable mechanical \nmounting on the PCB.  \n• Provid e multiple hard mounting points.  \n• Keep the PCB thick and avoid a large surface area PCB that induces higher magnitude and lower frequency resonances.  \n• Ensure the mechanical connection is sufficiently stiff to transfer mechanical forces up to the desired freq uency. \nBelow 10 kHz, magnetic and adhesive mounting is possible with proper attention. The EVA L -ADXL1001Z  and the \nEVA L -ADXL1002Z  evaluation boards can be used as a \nreference.  \nThe ADXL1001 /ADXL1002 electrical output supports a bandwidth  \nbeyond the resonance of the sensor. The small signal  bandwidth of \nthe output amplifier in the ADXL1001/ ADXL1002 is 70  kHz.  \nDuring the digitization process, aliasing, which is the folding of higher frequency noise and signals int o the desired band, can \noccur. To avoid aliasing noise from the amplifier and other \ninternal circuits (for example, coupling of the internal 200 kHz \nclock), it is recommended that an external filter be  implemented at the desired bandwidth and the chosen ADC sampling rate be faster than the amplifier bandwidth.  \nThe output amplifier is ratiometric to the supply voltage , and \nthere are two distinct cases  regarding digital conversion, as \nfollows :  \n• The user has an analog- to-digital (ADC) downstream of \nthe accelerometer that can use the V\nDD voltage as a \nreference. In this case, the voltage supply toleran ce and \nvoltage temperature coefficient (commonly associated with \nexternal regulators) track s between the sensor and  the \nADC and , therefore , the supply and reference voltage \ninduced error cancel s out. This design approach is \nrecommended.  \n• If the ADC cannot reference the same 5 V supply as the \nsensor for any reason, the sensitivity of the digitized sensor \noutput reflects the regulator tolerance and temperature \ncoefficient.  \nThe ADXL1001/ ADXL1002  output amplifier is stable while \ndriving capacitive loads up to 100 pF directly without a series \nresistor. At loads greater than 100 pF, a n 8 kΩ series resistor or \ngreater must be use d.  \nSee Figure 25 for an example of the interface including  compo -\nnents when measuring mechanical vibration from 0 kHz to \n5 kHz, using the AD4 000 ADC . For a 5 kHz pass band, a single -\npole RC filter is  acceptable ; however , in some application s, use a \nmore aggressive filter and lower sample rat e. The following \ncomponents are  recommended to form a two -pole RC filter at \nthe output of the ADXL1001/ ADXL1002: R1 = 91 kΩ, C1 = \n330 pF, R2 = 0  Ω, and C2 = not required . A minimum  ADC \nsample rate of 16 kHz is recommended to avoid aliasing.   \nSee Figure 25 for an example of the interface including  compo -\nnents when measuring mechanical vibration from 0 kHz to 10 kHz. The following components are recommended to form a \ntwo-pole RC filter at the output of the ADXL1001/ ADXL1002: \nR1 = 16 kΩ, C1 = 300 pF, R2 = 32 kΩ , and C2 = 300 pF. A  \nminimum ADC sample rate of 32 kHz is recommended to avoid aliasing. The two -pole RC filter produces an attenuation of \napproximately 84 dB at 200 kHz, the internal clock frequency.  \n \nFigure 25.

To accommo -\ndate this, the ADXL1001/ ADXL1002 output amplifier supports \na 70 kHz s mall signal bandwidth, which is well beyond the \nresonant frequency  of the sensor.  \nAlthough  a mechanical interface is always important to achieve \naccurate and repeatable results  in MEMS application s, it is \ncritical in cases  when measuring greater than  a few kilohertz . \nTypically, magnetic and adhesive mounting are not sufficient to maintain proper mechanical transfer of vibration through these  \nfrequencies. Mechanical system analysis is required for these applications.  \nWhen using the ADXL1001/ ADXL1002 beyond 10 kHz, \nconsider the nonlinearity due to the resonance frequency of the sensor, the additional noise due to the wideband output of the amplifier, and the discrete frequency spurious tone due to coupling of the internal 200 kHz clock. If any of these \ninterferers alias in the desired band, it cannot be removed and observed performance degrades. A comb ination of high speed \nsampling and appropriate filtering is required for optimal performance.  \nThe first consideration is the effect of the sensor resonance \nfrequency at 21 kHz. Approaching and above this frequency, the \noutput response to an input stimulus peaks, as shown in Figure 4. \nAt frequencies near or above the resonance, the output response is outside the linear response range and , therefore , the sensitivity is \ndifferent than observed at lower frequencies . In these frequency \nranges, the relative response (as opposed to absolute value) over time is typically observed.  \nThe ADXL1001/ ADXL1002  output amplifier small signal \nbandwidth is 70 kHz. The user must properly interface to the \ndevice with proper signal filtering to avoid issues with out of \nband noise aliasing into  the desired band. The amplifier \nfrequency response roll off can be modeled as a single -pole, \nlow-pass filter at 70 kHz. In the absence of additional external \nlow-pass filtering, to avoid aliasing of high frequency noise, \nchoose a sampling rate of at least  twice the equivalent noise \nbandwidth  (ENBW)  for a single -pole, low -pass filter, as follows:  \nkHz110 kHz702≈×=πENBW  \n \n \n \n That is, sampling rate must be at least 220 kHz. This sample rate \naddresses reducing broadband noise due to the amplifier from \nfolding back (aliasing) in -band, but does not prevent out of \nband signals from aliasing in -band. To prevent out of band \nresponses , additional external low -pass filtering is required.  \nAnother issue that must be addressed is the coupling of the \ninternal clock signal at 200 kHz onto the output signal. This clock spur must be filtered by analog or digital filtering so as \nnot to affect the analysis of results.  \nFor example, to achieve the lowest rms noise and noise density \nfor extended bandwidth applications, it is recommended to use \nat least a multi ple order low -pass filter at the output of the \nADXL1001/ ADXL1002 and a digitization sample rate of at least \n4× the desired bandwidth, assuming sufficient filtering of the \n200 kHz internal clock signal. Use a n ADC sample rate of 1 \nMSPS or greater  along with digital low -pass filtering to achieve \nsimilar performance.    \nOVERRANGE  \nThe ADXL1001/ ADXL1002  have an output (OR  pin) to signal \nwhen an overrange event (accelera tion larger than twice the \nfull-scale range). Built in overrange detection circuitry provides \nan alert  to indicate a significant overrange event occurred  that is \ngreater than approximately 2× the specified g  range . When an \nover range is detected , the internal clock is disabled to the sensor \nfor 200 µs to maximize protection of the sensor element  during \nan overrange event . If a sustained overrange event is  encoun tered, \nthe overrange detection circuitry triggers periodically , approxi -\nmately every 500 µs.   \n \nFigure 26.

Mounting  the \nADXL1001/ ADXL1002 at an unsupported PCB location, as \nshown in Figure 27, may result in large, apparent measurem ent \nerrors due to undamped PCB vibration. Placing the accel -\nerometer near a hard mounting point ensures that any PCB \nvibration at the accelerometer is above the mechanical sensor  \nresonant frequency of the accelerometer and, therefore,  effectively \ninvisible  to the accelerometer. Multiple mounting points, close \nto the sensor, and a thicker PCB also help to reduce the effect of system resonance on the performance of the sensor.   \nFigure 27.
