Based on the Analog \nDevices, Inc., iCoupler® technology, the dc-to-dc converter provides \nup to 400 mW of regulated, isolated power at either 5.0 V or 3.3 V \nfrom a 5.0 V input supply, or at 3.3 V from a 3.3 V supply at the power levels shown in Table 1. These devices eliminate the need \nfor a separate, isolated dc-to-dc converter in low power, isolated \ndesigns. \nThe ADuM6400/ ADuM6401/ ADuM6402/ ADuM6403/ \nADuM6404 isolators provide four independent isolation \nchannels in a variety of channel configurations and data rates \n(see the Ordering Guide for more information). \nisoPower uses high frequency switching elements to transfer power \nthrough its transformer. Special care must be taken during printed \ncircuit board (PCB) layout to meet emissions standards. See the \nAN-0971 Application Note for board layout recommendations.

A | Page 21 of 28 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe dc-to-dc converter section of the ADuM640x  works on \nprinciples that are common to most switching power supplies. It \nhas a secondary side controller architecture with isolated pulse-width modulation (PWM) feedback. V\nDD1 power is supplied to \nan oscillating circuit that switches current into a chip scale air core transformer. Power transferred to the secondary side is rectified and regulated to either 3.3 V or 5 V . The secondary (V\nISO) side controller regulates the output by creating a PWM \ncontrol signal that is sent to the primary (V DD1) side by a dedicated \niCoupler data channel. The PWM modulates the oscillator circuit to control the power being sent to the secondary side. Feedback allows for significantly higher power and efficiency. \nThe ADuM640x  implements undervoltage lockout (UVLO) \nwith hysteresis on the V\nDD1 power input. This feature ensures \nthat the converter does not enter oscillation due to noisy input \npower or slow power-on ramp rates. \nA minimum load current of 10 mA is recommended to ensure \noptimum load regulation. Smaller loads can generate excess noise on chip due to short or erratic PWM pulses. Excess noise that is \ngenerated in this way can cause data corruption, in some cases. \nPCB LAYOUT \nThe ADuM640x  digital isolators with 0.4 W isoPower integrated \ndc-to-dc converter require no external interface circuitry for the \nlogic interfaces. Power supply bypassing is required at the input and output supply pins (see Figure 27 ). Note that low ESR bypass \ncapacitors are required between Pin 1 and Pin 2 and between \nPin 15 and Pin 16, as close to the chip pads as possible. \nThe power supply section of the ADuM640x  uses a 180 MHz \noscillator frequency to pass power efficiently through its chip \nscale transformers. In addition, the normal operation of the data \nsection of the i Coupler introduces switching transients on the \npower supply pins. Bypass capacitors are required for several \noperating frequencies. Noise suppression requires a low induc-tance, high frequency capacitor, whereas ripple suppression and \nproper regulation require a large value capacitor. These capacitors \nare most conveniently connected between Pin 1 and Pin 2 for \nV\nDD1, and between Pin 15 and Pin 16 for V ISO.  \nTo suppress noise and reduce ripple, a parallel combination of  \nat least two capacitors is required. The recommended capacitor values are 0.1 μF and 10 μF for V\nDD1 and V ISO. The smaller \ncapacitor must have a low ESR; for example, use of a ceramic capacitor is advised.  \n \n    \n The total lead length between the ends of the low ESR capacitor \nand the input power supply pin must not exceed 2 mm. Installing the bypass capacitor with traces more than 2 mm in length may result in data corruption. Consider bypassing between Pin 1 \nand Pin 8 and between Pin 9 and Pin 16 unless both common \nground pins are connected together close to the package. \nVDD1\nGND1VISO\nGNDISO\nVIA/VOA\nVIB/VOB\nVIC/VOC\nVDDLVID/VODVIA/VOA\nVIB/VOB\nVIC/VOC\nVID/VOD\nVSEL\nGND1BYPASS < 2mm\nGNDISO\n08141-025 \nFigure 27. Recommended PCB Layout \nIn applications involving high common-mode transients, ensure \nthat board coupling across the isolation barrier is minimized. \nFurthermore, design the board layout such that any coupling that does occur affects all pins equally on a given component side. Failure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between pins exceeding the absolute maximum ratings for the device  as specified in Table 19 , thereby leading to latch-up and/or \npermanent damage. \nThe ADuM640x  is a power device that dissipates approximately \n1 W of power when fully loaded and running at maximum speed. \nBecause it is not possible to apply a heat sink to an isolation device, the device primarily depends on heat dissipation into the PCB through the GND pins. If the device is used at high ambient temperatures, provide a thermal path from the GND \npins to the PCB ground plane. The board layout in Figure 27  \nshows enlarged pads for Pin 8 (GND\n1) and Pin 9 (GND ISO). \nMultiple vias should be implemented from the pad to the ground \nplane to significantly reduce the temperature inside the chip. The dimensions of the expanded pads are at the discretion of the designer and depend on the available board space. \nSTART-UP BEHAVIOR \nThe ADuM640x  devices do not contain a soft start circuit. \nTherefore, the start-up current and voltage behavior must be \ntaken into account when designing with this device. \nWhen power is applied to V DD1, the input switching circuit begins \nto operate and draw current when the UVLO minimum voltage \nis reached. The switching circuit drives the maximum available power to the output until it reaches the regulation voltage where PWM control begins. The amount of current and the time \nrequired to reach regulation voltage depends on the load and \nthe V\nDD1 slew rate. \nWith a fast V DD1 slew rate (200 μs or less), the peak current draws \nup to 100 mA/V of V DD1. The input voltage goes high faster than \nthe output can turn on, so the peak current is proportional to the maximum input voltage. \nADuM6400/ADuM6401/ADuM 6402/ADuM6403/ADuM6404 Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 22 of 28 With a slow V DD1 slew rate (in the millisecond range), the input \nvoltage is not changing quickly when V DD1 reaches the UVLO \nminimum voltage. The current surge is approximately 300 mA \nbecause V DD1 is nearly constant at the 2.7 V UVLO voltage. The \nbehavior during startup is similar to when the device load is a short circuit; these values are consistent with the short-circuit \ncurrent shown in Figure 16 . \nWhen starting the device for V\nISO = 5 V operation, do not limit \nthe current available to the V DD1 power pin to less than 300 mA. \nThe ADuM640x  devices may not be able to drive the output to \nthe regulation point if a current-limiting device clamps the V DD1 \nvoltage during startup. As a result, the ADuM640x  devices can \ndraw large amounts of current at low voltage for extended periods of time. \nThe output voltage of the ADuM640x  devices exhibits V\nISO \novershoot during startup. If this overshoot could potentially \ndamage components attached to V ISO, a voltage-limiting device \nsuch as a Zener diode can be used to clamp the voltage. Typical behavior is shown in Figure 21  and Figure 22 . \nEMI CONSIDERATIONS \nThe dc-to-dc converter section of the ADuM640x  devices must \noperate at 180 MHz to allow efficient power transfer through the small transformers. This creates high frequency currents that can propagate in circuit board ground and power planes, causing edge emissions and dipole radiation between the primary and secondary ground planes. Grounded enclosures are recommended for applications that use these devices. If grounded enclosures \nare not possible, follow good RF design practices in the layout \nof the PCB. See the AN-0971 Application Note  for board layout \nrecommendations. \nPROPAGATION DELAY PARAMETERS \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it takes \na logic signal to propagate through a component. The propagation \ndelay to a logic low output may differ from the propagation \ndelay to a logic high output. \nINPUT ( VIx)\nOUTPUT (VOx)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n08141-026 \nFigure 28. Propagation Delay Parameters \nPulse width distortion is the maximum difference between \nthese two propagation delay values and is an indication of how \naccurately the timing of the input signal is preserved. \nChannel-to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthat the propagation delay differs between channels within a \nsingle ADuM640x  component. \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount that  \nthe propagation delay differs between multiple ADuM640x  \ncomponents operating under the same conditions. \n DC CORRECTNESS AND MAGNETIC FIELD \nIMMUNITY \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input  \ncause narrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the \ntransformer. The decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set \nor reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the  \nabsence of logic transitions at the input for more than 1 μs, a periodic set of refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state is sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses for more than approximately 5 μs, the \ninput side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, and \nthe isolator output is forced to a default state by the watchdog \ntimer circuit. This situation should occur in the ADuM640x  \ndevices only during power-up and power-down operations. \nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the ADuM640x  \nis set by the condition in which induced voltage in the receiving \ncoil of the transformer is sufficiently large to either falsely set or \nreset the decoder. The following analysis defines the conditions \nunder which this may occur. The 3.3 V operating condition of the ADuM640x  is examined because it represents the most suscept-\nible mode of operation. \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0 V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at approximately 0.5 V , thus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages \ncan be tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is \ngiven by \nV = (−dβ/dt) \n∑ πrn2; n = 1, 2, … , N \nwhere: \nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss).  r\nn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nN is the total number of turns in the receiving coil. \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM640x  and \nan imposed requirement that the induced voltage be, at most, \n50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable \nmagnetic field is calculated as shown in Figure 29 . \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n08141-027 \nFigure 29.

A | Page 23 of 28 For example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a voltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This voltage is approxi-mately 50% of the sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty \noutput transition. Similarly, if such an event occurs during a \ntransmitted pulse (and is of the worst-case polarity), it reduces the received pulse from >1.0 V to 0.75 V—still well above the \n0.5 V sensing threshold of the decoder. \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances from the ADuM640x  transformers. Figure 30  expresses these allowable \ncurrent magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected \ndistances. As shown in Figure 30 , the ADuM640x  is extremely \nimmune and can be affected only by extremely large currents \noperated at high frequency very close to the component. For the 1 MHz example noted, a 0.5 kA current placed 5 mm away from \nthe ADuM640x  is required to affect the operation of the device. \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)1k\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n1k 10k 100M 100k 1M 10MDISTANCE = 5mmDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n08141-028 \nFigure 30.

Exercise care in the layout of such traces to avoid this \npossibility. \nPOWER CONSUMPTION \nThe V DD1 power supply input provides power to the iCoupler data \nchannels as well as to the power converter. For this reason, the \nquiescent currents drawn by the data converter and the primary and secondary input/output channels cannot be determined separately. All of these quiescent power demands are combined into the I\nDD1(Q)  current shown in Figure 31 . The total I DD1 supply \ncurrent is the sum of the quiescent operating current, the dynamic current I\nDD1(D)  demanded by the I/O channels, and any external \nIISO load.

Power Consumption Within the ADuM640x  \nBoth dynamic input and output current is consumed only  when operating at channel speeds higher than the refresh  rate, f\nr. Each channel has a dynamic current determined by  \nits data rate. Figure 23  shows the current for a channel in the \nforward direction, which means that the input is on the primary side of the part. Figure 24  shows the current for a channel in the \nreverse direction, which means that the input is on the secondary side of the part. Both figures assume a typical 15 pF load. The following relationship allows the total I\nDD1 current to be calculated: \nIDD1 = (IISO × VISO)/(E × VDD1) + ∑ ICHn; n = 1 to 4 (1) \nwhere:  I\nDD1 is the total supply input current. \nIISO is the current drawn by the secondary side external loads.  \nE is the power supply efficiency at the maximum load from \nFigure 13  at the V ISO and V DD1 condition of interest. \nICHn is the current drawn by a single channel, determined from \nFigure 23  or Figure 24 , depending on channel direction. \nCalculate the maximum external load by subtracting the \ndynamic output load from the maximum allowable load. \nIISO(LOAD)  = I ISO(MAX)  − ∑ IISO(D)n ; n = 1 to 4 (2) \nwhere: \nIISO(LOAD)  is the current available to supply an external secondary \nside load. \nIISO(MAX)  is the maximum external secondary side load current \navailable at V ISO. \nIISO(D)n  is the dynamic load current drawn from V ISO by an input \nor output channel, as shown in Figure 23  and Figure 24  for a \ntypical 15 pF load. \nThis analysis assumes a 15 pF capacitive load on each data output. \nIf the capacitive load is larger than 15 pF, the additional current \nmust be included in the analysis of I DD1 and I ISO(LOAD) . \nTo determine I DD1 in Equation 1, additional primary side \ndynamic output current (I AOD) is added directly to I DD1. \nAdditional secondary side dynamic output current (I AOD)  \nis added to I ISO on a per-channel basis. \nTo determine I ISO(LOAD)  in Equation 2, additional secondary  \nside output current (I AOD) is subtracted from I ISO(MAX)  on a  \nper-channel basis. \n \nADuM6400/ADuM6401/ADuM 6402/ADuM6403/ADuM6404 Data Sheet\n \nRev. A | Page 24 of 28 For each output channel with C L greater than 15 pF, the \nadditional capacitive supply current is given by \nIAOD = 0.5 × 10−3 × (( CL − 15) × VISO) × (2 f − fr); f > 0.5 f r (3) \nwhere: \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF). \nVISO is the output supply voltage (V). \nf is the input logic signal frequency (MHz); it is half the input \ndata rate expressed in units of Mbps. f\nr is the input channel refresh rate (Mbps). \nCURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADuM640x  is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by thermal overload protection circuits. \nThermal overload protection limits the junction temperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and power dissipation), when the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C, the PWM is turned off, turning off the output current. When the junction \ntemperature drops below 130°C (typical), the PWM turns on \nagain, restoring the output current to its nominal value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from V\nISO to ground occurs. \nAt first, the ADuM640x  reaches its maximum current, which is \nproportional to the voltage applied at V DD1. Power dissipates on \nthe primary side of the converter (see Figure 16 ). If self-heating \nof the junction becomes great enough to cause its temperature \nto rise above 150°C, thermal shutdown is activated, turning off \nthe PWM and turning off the output current. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 130°C, the PWM turns on and power dissipates again on the primary side of the converter, causing the junction temperature to rise to 150°C again. This \nthermal oscillation between 130°C and 150°C causes the part  \nto cycle on and off as long as the short remains at the output. \nThermal limit protections are intended to protect the device \nagainst accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, externally limit device power dissipation to prevent junction \ntemperatures from exceeding 130°C. \nPOWER CONSIDERATIONS \nThe ADuM6400/ ADuM6401/ ADuM6402/ ADuM6403/ \nADuM6404 power input, data input channels on the primary \nside, and data input channels on the secondary side are all \nprotected from premature operation by undervoltage lockout \n(UVLO) circuitry. Below the minimum operating voltage, the power converter holds its oscillator inactive, and all input channel drivers and refresh circuits are idle. Outputs remain in a high impedance state to prevent transmission of undefined states during power-up and power-down operations. \n \n \n  During application of power to V\nDD1, the primary side circuitry \nis held idle until the UVLO preset voltage is reached. At that \ntime, the data channels initialize to their default low output \nstate until they receive data pulses from the secondary side. \nWhen the primary side is above the UVLO threshold, the data \ninput channels sample their inputs and begin sending encoded \npulses to the inactive secondary output channels. The outputs \non the primary side remain in their default low state because no data comes from the secondary side inputs until secondary side power is established. The primary side oscillator also begins to \noperate, transferring power to the secondary power circuits. \nThe secondary V\nISO voltage is below its UVLO limit at this point; \nthe regulation control signal from the secondary side is not being \ngenerated. The primary side power oscillator is allowed to free \nrun under these conditions, supplying the maximum amount of \npower to the secondary side.  \nAs the secondary side voltage rises to its regulation setpoint,  \na large inrush current transient is present at V DD1. When the \nregulation point is reached, the regulation control circuit pro-duces the regulation control signal that modulates the oscillator \non the primary side. The V\nDD1 current is then reduced and is \nproportional to the load current. The inrush current is less than \nthe short-circuit current shown in Figure 16 . The duration of \nthe inrush current depends on the V ISO loading conditions and \non the current and voltage available at the V DD1 pin. \nAs the secondary side converter begins to accept power from the primary, the V\nISO voltage starts to rise. When the secondary \nside UVLO is reached, the secondary side outputs are initialized to their default low state until data is received from the corre-sponding primary side input. It can take up to 1 μs after the secondary side is initialized for the state of the output to \ncorrelate to the primary side input. \nSecondary side inputs sample their state and transmit it to the \nprimary side. Outputs are valid about 1 μs after the secondary side becomes active. \nBecause the rate of charge of the secondary side power supply is \ndependent on loading conditions, the input voltage, and the output \nvoltage level selected, take care that the design allows the con-\nverter sufficient time to stabilize before valid data is required. \nWhen power is removed from V\nDD1, the primary side converter \nand coupler shut down when the UVLO level is reached. The \nsecondary side stops receiving power and starts to discharge.  \nThe outputs on the secondary side hold the last state that they \nreceived from the primary side. Either the UVLO level is reached and the outputs are placed in their high impedance state, or the \noutputs detect a lack of activity from the primary side inputs \nand the outputs are set to their default low value before the \nsecondary power reaches UVLO. \n \nData Sheet ADuM6400/ADuM6401/ADuM 6402/ADuM6403/ADuM6404\n \nRev. A | Page 25 of 28 THERMAL ANALYSIS Bipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. The goal  \nof a 50-year operating lifetime under the bipolar ac condition determines the maximum working voltage recommended by \nAnalog Devices. The ADuM640x  devices consist of four internal silicon die \nattached to a split lead frame with two die attach paddles. For \nthe purposes of thermal analysis, the device is treated as a thermal unit with the highest junction temperature reflected in the θ\nJA \nvalue from Table 14 . The value of θ JA is based on measurements \ntaken with the part mounted on a JEDEC standard 4-layer board with fine width traces and still air. Under normal operating conditions, the ADuM640x  operates at full load across the full \ntemperature range without derating the output current. How-ever, following the recommendations in the PCB Layout section \ndecreases the thermal resistance to the PCB, allowing increased \nthermal margin at high ambient temperatures. In the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insu-\nlation is significantly lower. This allows operation at higher \nworking voltages while still achieving a 50-year service life.  \nThe working voltages listed in Table 20  can be applied while \nmaintaining the 50-year minimum lifetime, provided that the \nvoltage conforms to either the unipolar ac or dc voltage cases.  \nAny cross-insulation voltage waveform that does not conform \nto Figure 33  or Figure 34  should be treated as a bipolar ac wave-\nform and its peak voltage limited to the 50-year lifetime voltage \nvalue listed in Table 20 . The voltage presented in Figure 33  is \nshown as sinusoidal for illustration purposes only. It is meant to \nrepresent any voltage waveform varying between 0 V and some limiting value. The limiting value can be positive or negative, \nbut the voltage cannot cross 0 V . INSULATION LIFETIME \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected \nto voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insu-\nlation degradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage waveform applied across the insulation. In addition to the testing performed by the regulatory agencies, Analog Devices \ncarries out an extensive set of evaluations to determine the life-\ntime of the insulation structure within the ADuM640x  devices. \n0VRATED PE AKVOLTAGE\n08141-030\nFigure 32.

DC Waveform Analog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage \nlevels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Accel-eration factors for several operating conditions are determined. These factors allow calculation of the time to failure at the actual working voltage. The values shown in Table 20  summarize the \npeak voltage for 50 years of service life for a bipolar ac operating condition and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working vol-tages. In many cases, the approved working voltage is higher than the 50-year service life voltage. Operation at these high working \nvoltages can lead to shortened insulation life in some cases. \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM640x  devices depends on \nthe voltage waveform type imposed across the isolation barrier. \nThe iCoupler insulation structure degrades at different rates \ndepending on whether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, \nor dc. Figure 32 , Figure 33 , and Figure 34  illustrate these \ndifferent isolation voltage waveforms.  \n \nADuM6400/ADuM6401/ADuM 6402/ADuM6403/ADuM6404 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
