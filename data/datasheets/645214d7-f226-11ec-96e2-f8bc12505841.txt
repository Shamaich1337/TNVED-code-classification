During the sleep cycle,  the RT6208  draws \nonly 25\uf06dA of supply current. At light  loads, the BCM \ncycles are a small percentage of the total  cycle time \nwhich minimizes the average supply current,  greatly \nimproving efficiency.  \nScheme of Hysteresis Mode  \nThe feedback comparator monitors the voltage on the \nVFB pin and compares it to an internal 800mV \nreference , as shown in Figure 1. If  this voltage is \ngreater than the reference, the comparator  activates a \nsleep mode in which  the power switches and  current comparators are disabled, reducing the VIN pin  supply \ncurrent to only 25\uf06dA. As the load current discharges  \nthe output capacitor, the voltage on the V FB pin \ndecreases.  When this voltage falls 5mV below the \n800mV reference,  the feedback comparator trips and \nenables BCM . At the beginning of the BCM , the internal \nhigh-side power switch (P -channel MOSFET) is turned \non and the  inductor current begins to ramp up. The \ninductor current  increases until either the current \nexceeds the pe ak current  comparator threshold, or the \nON time  of the high-side MOSFET exceeds  5μs during \nthe time  VFB is higher than  800mV , at which the \nhigh-side power switch  is turned off, and the Low-side \npower switch is turned on. The inductor current ramps \ndown until  the reverse current is close to zero. If the \nvoltage on the V FB pin is  still less than the 800mV \nreference, the high-side power  switch is turned on \nagain and another cycle commences  which keep the \ninductor current  operated in a boundary conduction \nmode . The average current during the BCM will \nnormally be  greater than the average load current . For \nRT6208    \nCopyright ©  2016 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The hystere sis \nnature of thi s control architecture results  in a switching \nfrequency that is a function of the input  voltage, output \nvoltage and inductor value. This behavior  provides \ninherent short ‑circuit protection. If the output  is shorted to ground, the inductor current will decay very  slowly \nduring a single switching cycle. Since the high-side \nswitch turns on only when the inductor current is near  \nzero, the RT6208  inherently switches at a lower \nfrequency  during short -circuit condition.\nBoundary Conduction \nModeSleep \nModeSleep \nMode\nSwitch between High-Side PC and \nLow-Side ZCStop Switch VREF\nVREF - VHys   \nHigh-Side Peak Current (PC) \nLow-Side Zero Current (ZC)VFB\nInductor Current\n \nFigure 1.

External component \nselection is determined by the maximum load current \nrequirement and begins with the selection of the peak \ncurrent programming resistor, R ISET. The inductor \nvalue L can then be determined, followed by capacitors \nCIN and C OUT. \nPeak Current Resistor Selection  \nThe peak current comparator has a maximum current \nlimit of 225mA nominally, which results in a maximum \naverage  current of 112mA. For applications that \ndemand les s current, the peak current threshold can be \nreduced t o as  little as 50mA.  The threshold can be \neasily programmed with an appropriately  chosen \nresistor (RISET) between the ISET pin  and ground. \nThe value of resistor for a particular peak  current can \nbe computed by following  equation  \n\uf028 \uf0296PEAK RISET = I   0.05   5.88  10 \uf02d \uf0b4 \uf0b4\n \nwhere 50mA < I PEAK  < 225mA. \nThe peak current is internally limited to be within the  \nrange of 50mA to 2 25mA. Shorting the ISET pin to \nground  programs the current limit to 50mA, and leaving \nit floating  sets the current limit to the maximum value of \n225mA.  When selecting this resistor value, be aware \nthat the  maximum average output current for this \narchitecture is  limited to half of the peak current. \nTherefore, be sure to  select a value that sets the peak \ncurrent with enough margin  to provide adequate load \ncurrent under all foreseeable  operating conditions.  \nOutput Voltage Setting  and Feedback Network  \nThe resistive divider allows the FB pin to sense the \noutput voltage.  The output voltage is set by an external \nresistive voltage divider according to the followin g \nequation  : \n1OUT REF\n2RV = V  1   + R\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0b4\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8 \nWhere V REF is the reference voltage (0.8V typ.).  \nThe resistive divider attenuate s the ripple signal on FB \npin as well. A small feed forward capacitor C FF can be \nadded in parallel with the upper feedback resistor R1 . It \nhelps to reduce switch -noise coupling on the FB pin \nand increases the FB pin ripple voltage to improve \nswitching stabi lity and avoid double pulses. The C FF \nvalue is dependent on the feedback network \nimpedance and the peak -peak ripple voltage on the \noutput. Recommended C FF values range from 47pF to \n470pF.  \nInductor Selection  \nThe inductor, input voltage, output voltage and peak \ncurrent  determine the switching frequency of the \nRT6208 . For a given input voltage, output voltage and \npeak current,  the inductor v alue sets the maximum \nswitching frequency when the  load current  is close to \n1/2 of the peak current.  A good first choice for the \ninductor  value can be determined by the following \nequation  : \nOUT OUT\nMAX PEAK INVVL =   1  f   I V\uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 \uf0f6\uf0b4\uf02d \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0b4\uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e8 \uf0f8\n \nThe variation in switching frequency would be \ncalculated with inductor, load current , input  and output \nvoltage .

If \nVIN falls belo w 3.9V typical, an under  voltage detector \ndisables switching. Switching is enabled when the input \nvoltage exceeds 4.2V typical (4. 75V ma ximum) . \nEnable Operation  \nThe EN pin can be used to shutdown or activate the \nchip.  Pulling the EN pin  low (< 1V) will shutdown the \ndevice. During shutdown  mode, the RT 6208  quies cent \ncurrent drops to lower than  3\uf06dA. Driving the EN pin \nhigh (> 1.4V) will turn o n the  device again. Leaving the \nEN pin floating will pull the EN pin up to 2V internally \nand enable RT6208.  \nSoft-Start  \nThe RT 6208  provides an internal soft -start function to  \nprevent large inrush current and output voltage \novershoot  when the converter starts up. The soft -start \nautomatically begins once the chip is enabled. During \nsoft-start,  it clamps the ramp of internal reference \nvoltage which  is compared with FB signal. The typical \nsoft-start duration  is 1ms.  \nCIN and C OUT Selection  \nThe input capacita nce, C IN, is needed to filter the  \ntriangular  current at the Source of the high -side \nMOSFET.  To prevent large ripple current, a low ESR \ninput capacitor  sized for the maximum RMS current \nshould be used. The  approximate RMS current \nequation is given :  \nOUT INRMS OUT(MAX)\nIN OUTV VI  = I 1VV\uf02d\n \nThis formula has a maximum at V IN = 2V OUT, where  \nIRMS = I OUT / 2. This simple worst case condition is  \ncommonly used for design because even significant  deviations do not offer much relief.  Choose a capacitor \nrated at a higher temperature than  required. Several \ncapacitors may also be paralleled to  meet size or \nheight requirements in the design.  \nThe output capacitor, C OUT, filters the inductor’s ripple  \ncurrent and stores energy to satisfy the load current \nwhen  the RT6208  is in sl eep mode . The value of the \noutput capacitor must be large enough to accept the \nenergy stored in the inductor without a large change in \noutput voltage. To achieve an output voltage \npeak -peak ripple less than 1%  of the output voltage, \nthe output capacitor mu st be  : \n2\nPEAKOUT\nOUTIC 50  L  V\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0b3 \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e8\uf0f8\n \nThermal Considerations  \nFor continuous operation, do not exceed absolute \nmaximum junction temperature. The maximum power \ndissipation depends on the thermal resistance of the IC \npackage, PCB layout, rate of surrounding airflow, and \ndifference between junction and ambient temperatu re. \nThe maximum power dissipation can be calculated by \nthe following formula :  \nPD(MAX)  = (T J(MAX)  \uf02d TA) / \uf071JA \nwhere T J(MAX)  is the maximum junction temperature, \nTA is the ambient temperature, and \uf071JA is the junction to \nambient thermal resistance.  \nFor recom mended operating condition specifications, \nthe maximum junction temperature is 125 \uf0b0C. The \njunction to ambient thermal resistance, \uf071JA, is layout \ndependent. For SOT -23-6 package, the thermal \nresistance, \uf071JA, is 208.2 \uf0b0C/W on a standard JEDEC \n51-7 four -layer thermal test board. For SOT -23-8 \npackage, the thermal resistance, \uf071JA, is 186.2 \uf0b0C/W on \na standard JEDEC 51 -7 four -layer thermal test board. \nThe maximum power dissipation at T A = 25\uf0b0C can be \ncalculated by the followin g formula :  \nPD(MAX)  = (125\uf0b0C \uf02d 25\uf0b0C) / (208.2 \uf0b0C/W) = 0.48W for       \nSOT-23-6 package  \nRT6208    \nCopyright ©  2016 Richtek Technology Corporation.
