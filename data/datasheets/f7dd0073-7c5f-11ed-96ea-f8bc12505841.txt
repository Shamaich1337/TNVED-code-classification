The \nIRS2153(1)D under voltage lock-out is designed to maintain an \nultra low supply current of less than 170 µA, and to guarantee the \nIC is fully functional before t he high and low side output drivers \nare activated. During under vo ltage lock-out mode, the high and \nlow-side driver outputs HO and LO are both low.   \nSupply voltage \nRT\nCT\nCOMVCC\n1\n2\n3\n47\n6\n58IRS2153(1)DLOVSHOVB\nCBOOT\nMHS\nMLSL\nRLRVCC\nRT\nCTCVCC+ AC Rectified Line\n- AC Rectified Line  \n \nFig. 1 Typical Connection Diagram \n \nFig. 1 shows an example of suppl y voltage. The start-up capacitor \n(CVCC) is charged by current through supply resistor (R VCC) minus \nthe start-up current drawn by the IC.  This resistor is chosen to provide sufficient current to s upply the IRS2153(1)D from the DC \nbus. C\nVCC should be large enough to hold the voltage at Vcc \nabove the UVLO threshold for one hal f cycle of the line voltage as \nit will only be charged at the peak, typically 0.1 uF. It will be necessary for R\nVCC to dissipate around 1 W.  \n \nThe use of a two diode charge pump made of DC1, DC2 and CVS (Fig. 2) from the half bridge (V\nS) is also possible however \nthe above approach is simplest  and the dissipation in R VCC should \nnot be unacceptably high.   \nRT\nCT\nCOMVCC\n1\n2\n3\n47\n6\n58IRS2153(1)DLOVSHOVB\nCBOOT\nMHS\nMLSL\nRLRVCC\nRT\nCTCVCC+ AC Rectified Line\n- AC Rectified LineDC1DC2\nCVS\n \nFig. 2 Charge pump circuit \n The supply resistor (R\nVCC) must be selected such that enough \nsupply current is available ov er all operating conditions.   \n Once the capacitor voltage on V\nCC reaches the start-up threshold \nVCCUV+ ,  the IC turns on and HO and LO begin to oscillate.  \n Bootstrap MOSFET  \nThe internal bootstrap FE T and supply capacitor (C BOOT) comprise \nthe supply voltage for the high side dr iver circuitry.  The internal \nboostrap FET only turns on when LO  is high. To guarantee that \nthe high-side supply is  charged up before the first pulse on pin \nHO, the first pulse from the output drivers comes from the LO pin. \n \nNormal operating mode  \nOnce the V CCUV+  threshold is passed, the MOSFET M1 opens, RT \nincreases to approximately V CC (V CC-VRT+) and the external CT \ncapacitor starts charging. On ce the CT voltage reaches V CT-  \n(about 1/3 of V CC), established by an internal resistor ladder, LO \nturns on with a delay equivalent to the deadtime (t d). Once the CT \nvoltage reaches V CT+ (approximately 2/3 of V CC), LO goes low, RT \ngoes down to approximately ground (V RT-), the CT capacitor \ndischarges and the deadtime circuit is  activated. At the end of the \ndeadtime, HO goes high.  Once the CT voltage reaches V CT-, HO \ngoes low, RT goes high again, the deadtime is activated. At the \nend of the deadtime, LO goes hi gh and the cycle starts over \nagain.  The following equation provides the oscillator frequency:  \nCT RTf××453.11~  \n \nThis equation can vary slightly from actual measurements due to \ninternal comparator over- and under-shoot delays.  For a more accurate determination of t he output frequency, the frequency \ncharacteristic curves should be used (RT vs. Frequency, page 3).  \n \nShut-down \nIf CT is pulled down below VCTSD (approximately 1/6 of V CC) by \nan external circuit, CT doesn’ t charge up and oscillation stops. \nLO is held low and the bootstrap FET is off. Oscillation will resume once CT is able to charge up again to V\nCT-. \n \n \n \n 10 \n IRS2153(1)D\n \n1818.218.418.618.819\n11 12 13 14 15 16\nVC C (V)Frequency (kHz )\nFREQ  v s VCC 9092949698100\n-25 0 25 50 75 100 125\nTemperature(C)Frequency (kHz )\nFREQ  v s TEMP\n \nFig. 3      Fig. 4 \n0.911.11.21.31.4\n11 12 13 14 15 16\nV CC(V )DT(uS)\nDT  vs VCC0.750.850.951.051.151.25\n-25 0 25 50 75 100 125\nTemperature(C)DT(uS)\nDT  vs TEMP \n \nFig. 5 (IRS2153D)      Fig. 6 (IRS2153D)  \nTj vs. Frequency (SOIC)0102030405060708090\n20 70 120\nFrequency(kHz)Temperature(C)\n151617\n-25 0 25 50 75 100 125\nTemperature (°C)VCC (V)\nVCC CLAMP vs TEMP\n \nFig. 7      Fig. 8  \n \n   \n 11 \n IRS2153(1)D\n \n050100150200250300\n-25 0 25 50 75 100 125\nTemperature(C)HOCurrent (mA )\nIsourceHO,IsinkHO  vs Temp IsourceHOIsinkHO\n050100150200250300\n-25 0 25 50 75 100 125\nTemperature(C)LO Current (mA)\nIsourceLO,IsinkLO  vs Temp IsourceLOIsinkLO\n \nFig. 9              Fig. 10  \n    01020304050607080\n-25 0 25 50 75 100 125\nTemperature(C)IB_CAP, IBS_10V (mA)\nIBCAP, IBS10V  vs TEMPIB_CA P\nIBS_10V\n    VOH_HO vs. Frequency\n0246810121416\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\nFrequency (kHz)VOH_HO (V)With External BS diode No external BS diode\nT=25°C, VS=0V, CHO = 1nF\n \n                                             Fig. 11                                                                                                 Fig. 12 \n  \nVOH_HO vs. Frequency vs. Temp\nVCC=14V, CHO=1nF, VS=0V\n02468101214\n1.46Khz20K50K75K\n100K125K150K200K\nFrequency (kHz)VOH_HO( V)\nT=-25c T=25c T=75c T=125c\n \nFig. 13  \n 12 \n \n IRS2153(1)D\n \n \n \nIRS2153(1)DPbF  \n \nIRS2153(1)DSPbF  \n \n    \n \n \n 13 \n \n IRS2153(1)D\n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \nCARRIER TAPE DIMENSION FOR 8SOICN\nCode Min Max Min Max\nA 7.90 8.10 0.311 0.318\nB 3.90 4.10 0.153 0.161\nC 11.70 12.30 0.46 0.484D 5.45 5.55 0.214 0.218\nE 6.30 6.50 0.248 0.255\nF 5.10 5.30 0.200 0.208G 1.50 n/a 0.059 n/aH 1.50 1.60 0.059 0.062Metric Imperial\n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n   \nREEL DIMENSIONS FOR 8SOICN\nCode Min Max Min Max\nA 329.60 330.25 12.976 13.001\nB 20.95 21.45 0.824 0.844\nC 12.80 13.20 0.503 0.519D 1.95 2.45 0.767 0.096\nE 98.00 102.00 3.858 4.015\nF n/a 18.40 n/a 0.724G 14.50 17.10 0.570 0.673H 12.40 14.40 0.488 0.566Metric ImperialEFA\nCD\nGA B H\nNOTE : CONTROLLING \nDIMENSION IN MMLOADED TAPE FEED DIRECTION\nA\nHF\nE\nGD\nB\nC\n \n \n       \n 14 \n IRS2153(1)D\n \n   \nPART MARKING INFORMATION  \n \n                 \n \n     \nORDER INFORMATION \n \n8-Lead  PDIP IRS2153DPbF \n8-Lead  PDIP IRS21531DPbF \n8-Lead  SOIC IRS2153DSPbF \n8-Lead  SOIC IRS21531DSPbF \n8-Lead SOIC Tape & Reel IRS2153DSTRPbF \n8-Lead SOIC Tape & Reel IRS21531DSTRPbF \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOIC-8 is MSL2 qualified. \nThis product has been designed and qualified for the industrial level. \nQualification standards can be found at www.irf.com  <http://www.irf.com> \nIR WORLD HEADQUARTERS:   233 Kansas St., El Segundo, California 90245, Tel: (310) 252-7105 \nData and specifications subject to  change without notice.  6/27/2006\n \n \n  \n\n'}]
