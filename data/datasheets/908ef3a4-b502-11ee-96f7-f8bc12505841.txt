The ADM483E is designed for balanced data transmission and complies with TIA/EIA \nStandards RS-485 and RS-422, which allow up to 32 transceivers \non a bus. \nThe ADM483E has a low current shutdown mode in which it \nconsumes only 0.1 μA. \nBecause only one driver is enabled at any time, the output of a \ndisabled or power-down driver is three-stated to avoid \noverloading the bus. Drivers are short-circuit current-limited and are protected \nagainst excessive power dissipation by thermal shutdown \ncircuitry that places their outputs into a high impedance state. \nThe receiver input has a fail-safe feature that guarantees a logic \nhigh output if the input is open circuit. \nThe ADM483E is fully specified over the industrial temperature \nranges and is available in 8-lead SOIC_N packages. \n \nADM483E  \n \nRev.

A | Page 11 of 16 GENERAL INFORMATION \nThe ADM483E is a robust RS-485 transceiver that operates \nfrom a single 5 V supply. \nIt is ideally suited for operation in electrically harsh environ-\nments or where cables may be plugged and unplugged. It is also immune to high RF field strengths without special shielding precautions. The ADM483E is intended for balanced data \ntransmission and complies with both EIA Standards RS-485 and \nRS-422. It contains a differential line driver and a differential line receiver; it is suitable for half-duplex data transmission \nbecause the driver and receiver share the same differential pins. \nThe input impedance on the ADM483E is 12 kΩ, allowing up to 32 transceivers on the differential bus. \nThe ADM483E operates from a single 5 V ± 10% power supply. \nExcessive power dissipation caused by bus contention or by output shorting is prevented by a thermal shutdown circuit. \nThis feature forces the driver output into a high impedance state \nif, during fault conditions, a significant temperature increase is \ndetected in the internal driver circuitry. \nThe receiver has a fail-safe feature that results in a logic high output state if the inputs are unconnected (floating). \nA high level of robustness is achieved using internal protection \ncircuitry, eliminating the need for external protection components \nsuch as transorbs or surge suppressors. \nLow electromagnetic emissions are achieved using slew limited drivers, minimizing interference both conducted and radiated. \nThe ADM483E can transmit at data rates up to 250 kbps. \nA typical application for the ADM483E is illustrated in Figure 23 . \nThis figure shows a half-duplex link where data may be \ntransferred at rates up to 250 kbps. A terminating resistor is \nshown at both ends of the link. This termination is not critical \nbecause the slew rate is controlled by the ADM483E and \nreflections are minimized. \nThe communications network can be extended to include \nmultipoint connections as shown in Figure 26 . Up to 32 \ntransceivers can be connected to the bus. E 3 8 4 M D A E 3 8 4 M D A\nRS-485/RS-422 LINKRO DIDE\nDI\nDEB\nA\nGNDB\nA\nGNDRO0.1µF 0.1µF+5V +5V\nVCCVCC RE\nRE\n06012-023 \nFigure 23.

A | Page 12 of 16 ESD TESTING \nTwo coupling methods are used for ESD testing: contact \ndischarge and air-gap discharge. Contact discharge calls for a \ndirect connection to the unit being tested. Air-gap discharge uses a higher test voltage but does not make direct contact with \nthe unit under test. With air-gap discharge, the discharge gun is \nmoved toward the unit under test, developing an arc across the air gap. This method is influenced by humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, distance, and rate of closure of the discharge gun. The contact discharge method, though less realistic, is more repeatable and is gaining acceptance and preference over \nthe air-gap method. \nAlthough very little energy is contained within an ESD pulse, \nthe extremely fast rise time, coupled with high voltages, can \ncause failures in unprotected semiconductors. Catastrophic destruction may occur immediately as a result of arcing or heating. Even if catastrophic failure does not occur immediately, the device may suffer from parametric degradation, which can \nresult in degraded performance. The cumulative effects of \ncontinuous exposure may eventually lead to complete failure. \nC1R2HIGH\nVOLTAGE\nGENERATOR\nDEVICE\nUNDER TEST\nESD TEST METHOD\nHUMAN BODY MODELR21.5kΩC1100pF\n06012-024 \nFigure 24. ESD Generator \nI/O lines are particularly vulnerable to ESD damage. Simply \ntouching or plugging in an I/O cable can result in a static discharge that may damage or completely destroy the interface \nproduct connected to the I/O port. It is, therefore, extremely important to have high levels of ESD protection on the I/O lines. \nIt is possible that the ESD discharge could induce latch-up in \nthe device under test. Therefore, it is important that ESD testing on the I/O pins be carried out while device power is applied. This type of testing is more representative of a real-world I/O \ndischarge where the equipment is operating normally when the \ndischarge occurs. \n100%\n90%\n36.8%\n10%\nTIME ( t)IPEAK\ntRL tDL\n06012-025 \nFigure 25.

A | Page 13 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nDIFFERENTIAL DATA TRANSMISSION \nDifferential data transmission is used to reliably transmit data at \nhigh rates over long distances and through noisy environments. \nDifferential transmission nullifies the effects of ground shifts and noise signals that appear as common-mode voltages on the \nline. There are two main standards approved by the Electronics \nIndustries Association (EIA) that specify the electrical character-\nistics of transceivers used in differential data transmission. \nThe RS-422 standard specifies data rates up to 10 MBaud and \nline lengths up to 4000 feet. A single driver can drive a transmission \nline with up to 10 receivers. \nTo accommodate true multipoint communications, the RS-485 \nstandard was defined. This standard meets or exceeds all the requirements of RS-422 and also allows for up to 32 drivers and \n32 receivers to be connected to a single bus. An extended \ncommon-mode range of −7 V to +12 V is defined. The most significant difference between RS-422 and RS-485 is the fact that the drivers can be disabled, thereby allowing more than one (32, in fact) to be connected to a single line. Only one driver should be enabled at a time, but the RS-485 standard contains \nadditional specifications to guarantee device safety in the event \nof line contention. \n CABLE AND DATA RATE \nThe transmission line of choice for RS-485 communications is a \ntwisted pair. Twisted pair cable tends to cancel common-mode \nnoise and also cancels the magnetic fields generated by the current flowing through each wire, thereby reducing the effective inductance of the pair. \nA typical application showing a multipoint transmission \nnetwork is shown in Figure 26 . An RS-485 transmission line can \nhave as many as 32 transceivers on the bus.
