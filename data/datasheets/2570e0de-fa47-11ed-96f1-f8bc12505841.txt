The on-chip resistors are\nlaser trimmed for accurate gain and high common-\nmode rejection. Excellent TCR tracking of the resis-\ntors maintains gain accuracy and common-mode re-\njection over temperature. The internal op amp’s com-\nmon-mode range extends to the negative supply—\nideal for single-supply applications. It operates on\nsingle (2.7V to 36V) or dual supplies ( ±1.35V to\n±18V).\nThe differential amplifier is the foundation of many\ncommonly used circuits. The INA132 provides this\ncircuit function without using an expensive precision\nresistor network. The INA132 is available in 8-pin\nDIP and SO-8 surface-mount packages and is speci-\nfied for operation over the extended industrial tem-\nperature range, –40 °C to +85°C.APPLICATIONS\nlDIFFERENTIAL INPUT AMPLIFIER\nlINSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER\nBUILDING BLOCK\nlUNITY-GAIN INVERTING AMPLIFIER\nlG = 1/2 AMPLIFIER\nlG = 2 AMPLIFIER\nlSUMMING AMPLIFIER\nlDIFFERENTIAL CURRENT RECEIVER\nlVOLTAGE-CONTROLLED CURRENT SOURCE\nlBATTERY-POWERED SYSTEMS\nlGROUND LOOP ELIMINATOR\n2\n3\n4–In\n+In\nV–40kΩ 40kΩ40kΩ 40kΩ5\n1Sense\nRef6Output7V+INA132\nINA132\r\nSBOS059\n\n2®\nINA132SPECIFICATIONS: VS = ±15V\nAt TA = +25°C, VS = ±15V, RL = 10kΩ connected to Ground, and Reference Pin connected to Ground, unless otherwise noted.\nThe information provided herein is believed to be reliable; however, BURR-BROWN assumes no responsibility for inaccuracies or omissions.

Power supply bypass capacitors should be\nconnected close to the device pins.\nThe differential input signal is connected to pins 2 and 3 as\nshown. The source impedances connected to the inputs must\nbe nearly equal to assure good common-mode rejection. An\n8Ω mismatch in source impedance will degrade the com-\nmon-mode rejection of a typical device to approximately\n80dB. Gain accuracy will also be slightly affected. If the\nsource has a known impedance mismatch, an additional\nresistor in series with one input can be used to preserve good\ncommon-mode rejection.\nDo not interchange pins 1 and 3 or pins 2 and 5, even though\nnominal resistor values are equal. These resistors are laser\ntrimmed for precise resistor ratios to achieve accurate gain\nand highest CMR. Interchanging these pins would not pro-\nvide specified performance. As shown in Figure 1, measure-\nments should be sensed at the load.supply ground). Although input voltages on pins 2 and 3\nthat are below the negative supply voltage will not damage\nthe device, operation in this region is not recommended.\nTransient conditions at the inverting input terminal below\nthe negative supply can cause a positive feedback condition\nthat could lock the INA132’s output to the negative rail.\nThe INA132 can accurately measure differential signals that\nare above the positive power supply. Linear common-mode\nrange extends to nearly twice the positive power supply\nvoltage—see typical performance curve, Common-Mode\nRange vs Output Voltage.\nOFFSET VOLTAGE TRIM\nThe INA132 is laser trimmed for low offset voltage and drift.\nMost applications require no external offset adjustment.\nFigure 2 shows an optional circuit for trimming the output\noffset voltage. The output is referred to the output reference\nterminal (pin 1), which is normally grounded. A voltage\napplied to the Ref terminal will be summed with the output\nsignal. This can be used to null offset voltage. The source\nimpedance of a signal applied to the Ref terminal should be\nless than 8 Ω to maintain good common-mode rejection. To\nassure low impedance at the Ref terminal, the trim voltage\ncan be buffered with an op amp, such as the OPA177.\nCAPACITIVE LOAD DRIVE CAPABILITY\nThe INA132 can drive large capacitive loads, even at low\nsupplies. It is stable with a 10,000pF load. Refer to the\n“Small-Signal Step Response” and “Settling Time vs Load\nCapacitance” typical performance curves.\nFIGURE 1. Basic Power Supply and Signal Connections.\nOPERATING VOLTAGE\nThe INA132 operates from single (+2.7V to +36V) or dual\n(±1.35V to ±18V) supplies with excellent performance.\nSpecifications are production tested with +5V and ±15V\nsupplies. Most behavior remains unchanged throughout the\nfull operating voltage range. Parameters which vary signifi-\ncantly with operating voltage are shown in the typical\nperformance curves.\nThe internal op amp in the INA132 is a single-supply design.\nThis allows linear operation with the op amp’s common-\nmode voltage equal to, or slightly below V– (or singleFIGURE 2.
