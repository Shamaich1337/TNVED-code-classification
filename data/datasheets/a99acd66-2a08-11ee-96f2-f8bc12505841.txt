The digital signal is encoded on top \nof the existing instrumentation signal. Communication \nis accomplished through a series of commands and \nresponses dependent on the specific protocol and net -\nwork topology. The DS8500 does not implement any \nportion of the communication protocol; it only handles the \nmodulation and demodulation of the encoded informa -\ntion. Digital data is encoded using frequency-shift keying \n(FSK), which is illustrated in Figure 1 . A “1” is identified as \na mark symbol and is represented with a center frequency \nof 1.2kHz. A “0” is identified as a space symbol and is rep -\nresented with a center frequency of 2.2kHz. This allows \na throughput of 1.2kbps, with each symbol occupying an \n833μs slot.\nFunctional Description\nThe DS8500 modem chip consists of a demodulator, car -\nrier detect, digital filter, ADC for input signal conversion, \na modulator and DAC for output signal generation, and \nreceive and transmit state machine blocks to perform \nthe HART communication. The Block Diagram  illustrates \nthe interface between various blocks of circuitry. The \ninput HART signal’s noise interference is attenuated by \na one-pole highpass filter that is external to the chip; the \nattenuated signal is digitized by the ADC and filtered by \nthe receive state machine. The transmit state machine \nmodulates the input to the HART-compliant signal with the \nhelp of the modulator and the DAC.Modulator\nThe modulator performs the FSK modulation of the digital \ndata at the D_IN input. The FSK-modulated sinusoidal \nsignal is present at the FSK_OUT output as illustrated in \nFigure 1 . The modulator is enabled by RTS being a logic-\nlow. The modulation is done between 1200Hz (mark) or \n2200Hz (space) depending on the logic level of the input \nsignal. The modulator preserves a continuous phase \nwhen switching between frequencies to minimize the \nbandwidth of the transmitted signal.\nFigure 2  illustrates an example waveform of the DS8500 \nin modulate mode. The data to be modulated is presented \nin a UART format (start, 8 data bits, parity, stop bit) at \nD_IN. FSK_OUT shows the modulated output.\nDemodulator\nThe demodulator accepts an FSK signal at the FSK_IN \ninput and reproduces the original modulating signal at \nthe D_OUT output. The HART signal should be presented \nas an 11-bit UART character with a start, data, parity, and \nstop bits for proper operation of the demodulator block. \nThe nominal bit rate of the D_OUT signal is 1200 bits per \nsecond. A simple RC filter is sufficient for anti-aliasing. \nFigure 3  illustrates an example waveform of the DS8500 \nin demodulate mode.\nApplications Information\nFigure 4  shows the typical application circuit. As the \nDS8500 integrates a digital filter, only a simple passive \nRC filter is required in front of the ADC. R3 and C3 imple -\nment a lowpass filter with a 10kHz cutoff frequency; C2 \nand R2/R1 implement a highpass filter with a 480Hz cut -\noff frequency. The resistor-divider formed by R1 and R2 \nprovides an input bias voltage of V REF/2 to the ADC input \n(R1 = R2) when in demodulator mode. V REF is powered \ndown in modulator mode in order to save power.\nThe output DAC provides a sine-wave signal, and C4 \nprovides the AC-coupled signal output from the DS8500. \nThe typical value of C4 can be anything greater than 20nF \nbased on the application.\nHART Registration\nThis IC has been tested and has received a Modem IC \nRegistration Certificate from the HART Communication \nFoundation. The use of this HART-registered IC reduces \nthe customer cost and effort associated with achieving \nHART registration of the end product.\nA copy of the DS8500 Registration Certificate (L2-06-\n1000-346) is available from the HART Communication \nFoundation at www.hartcomm.org.\nTechnical Support\nFor technical support, go to http://support.maximinte -\ngrated.com/micro .Figure 1.
