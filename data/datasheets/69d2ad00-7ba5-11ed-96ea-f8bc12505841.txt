At any moment the \ndevice can be in one out of two different states: active and inactive.  At active state, the CPU controlling the \ndevice is operating and can perform tasks such as: running a measurement seque nce, serving an interrupt, etc. \nWhen the device has no specific task to perform, it goes to an inactive state. A transition from active to inactive \nstate may occur at the end of a measurement sequence. In an inactive state, the CPU controlling the device i s in \nsleep mode to optimize power consumption. Several events can wake up the device: the reception of a \nmessage on the serial communication interface, a falling edge on pin PWM_DIS , the internal generation of a \nmeasurement request in continuous measuremen t mode.  \n4.4.1  Operating Modes  \nThe operating mode can be programmed via the serial communication interface by using the bit field \nMEAS_CFG.OP_MODE . \nThe sensor module supports three operating modes:  \n• Idle mode:  The device does not perform any CO2 concentration meas urement. The device remains inactive \nuntil it becomes active shortly to serve interrupts before going back to an inactive state.  \n• Continuous mode:  In this mode, the device periodically triggers a CO2 concentration measurement \nsequence. Once a measurement se quence is completed, the device goes back to an inactive s tate and wakes \nup automatically for the next measurement sequence. The measurement period is programmable from 5 \nsec to 4095 sec.  \n• Single -shot mode:  In this mode, the device triggers a single measurement sequence. At the end of the \nmeasurement sequence, the device goes back automatically to idle mode.  \n \n \nFigure 9  Operating mode transition  \n\n  \n \n \nDatasheet  Please read the Important Notice and Warnings at the end of this document  V 1.1  \nwww.infineon.com  page 15 of 24 2022 -06-13 PASCO2V01  \nCO 2 sensor based on Photo Acoustic Spectroscopy principle  \n4.4.2  Data post -processing  \nOnce the CO 2 concentration data has been acquired, several post -processing schemes can be applied to utilize \ndifferent functionality .  \n4.4.2.1  Pressure compensation  \nThe CO2 concentration value acquired by the sensor is dependent on the external atmospheric pressure. To \ncompen sate for this effect, the application system can provide the value of the atmospheric pressure by writing \ninto the specific registers, i.e.  PRESSREF_H and PRESSREF_L . At the end of a measurement sequence, the \ndevice reads the pressure value and applies  for compensation on the CO2 concentration value before storing it \ninto the result registers.  \n4.4.2.2  Automatic Baseline Offset Correction  \nTo correct slow drifts caused by aging during operation, the device supports Automatic Baseline Offset \nCompensation. Every week of operation, the device computes an offset to correct the baseline of the device. \nThe device must be in contact with the referen ce concentration (e.g. fresh air at. 400 ppm of CO2 \nconcentration) at least 30 minutes  per operating week to make sure proper  baseline compensation. The device \nsupports different configurations for compensation.  The ABOC setpoint may only be set between  350 and \n1500  ppm.  \n4.4.2.3  Forced compensation  \nForced compensation provides a mean s to speed up the offset compensation process. Before forced \ncompensation is enabled, the device shall be physically exposed to the reference CO2 concentration. The \ndevice will use the 3 next measurement s to calculate the compensation offset . The user shall ensure \nconstant exposure to the reference CO2 concentration during that time.  It is recommended to operate at 1 \nmeasurement per 10 seconds while implementing the forced compensation s cheme . When 3 measurement \nsequences are completed, the device automatically reconfigures itself with the newly computed offset applied \nto the subsequent CO2 concentration measurement results.   \n4.4.2.4  Alarm Threshold  \nThe device can be configured via interrupt to perform an alarm threshold check each time a new CO2 \nconcentration data is acquired. At the end of each measurement sequence, the computed CO2 value (after all \napplicable offset compensations) is compared to the concatenated value in ALARM_TH_H and ALAR M_TH_L . \nIn case of a threshold violation, the sticky bit MEAS_STS.ALARM is set. This also sets pin INT to active level  due \nto configuration as alarm . Bit MEAS_STS .ALARM is cleared by reading register MEAS_STS .ALARM _CLR . \n  \n  \n \n \nDatasheet  Please read the Important Notice and Warnings at the end of this document  V 1.1  \nwww.infineon.com  page 16 of 24 2022 -06-13 PASCO2V01  \nCO 2 sensor based on Photo Acoustic Spectroscopy principle  \n4.5 Monitoring mechanism  as a dvanced f unctionality  \nThe device supports several mechanisms to monitor the correct operation of the sensor.  \nTable 11  Functionality description  \nMechanism  Description  \nSensor Ready status  After each power -on reset, bit SENS_STS.SEN_RDY is set to confirm that the sensor \nhas initialized correctly.  \nScratchpad register  To check the integrity of the communication layer of the serial communication \ninterface, register SCRATCH_PAD can be used. This register can use this memory \nfield to write any value and verify that the data received by the device is correct.  \nIt can also be used to verify that a soft reset has been executed, using the following \nsequence:  \n1. The user writes a non -default value to register SCRATCH_PAD . \n2. The user reads back register SCRATCH_PAD to verify the writ \ncommend has been correctly executed.  \n3. The user writes register SENS_RST to trigger a soft reset.  \n4. The user reads register SCRATCH_PAD to verify that it has be en reset to its \ndefault value.  \nVDD12V verification  At power -up and the beginning of each measuremen t sequence, the device \nmeasures automatically the voltage at VDD12 . If the measured voltage exceeds the \nspecified operating range of the device, bit SENS_STS.ORVS is set. The \nmeasurement sequence is however completed normally.
