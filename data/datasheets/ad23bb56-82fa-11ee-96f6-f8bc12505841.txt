### Component Summary: MOCD217M

**Description:**
The MOCD217M is a dual-channel optocoupler featuring phototransistor outputs. It consists of two gallium arsenide infrared emitting diodes optically coupled to two monolithic silicon phototransistor detectors. This component is designed in a small outline, plastic package suitable for surface mounting, making it ideal for high-density applications.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Collector-Emitter Breakdown Voltage (V_BCE):
    - Minimum: 30 V (for MOCD217M)
  - Maximum Working Insulation Voltage (V_IORM): 565 V peak

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Continuous Forward Current (I_F): 60 mA
  - Continuous Collector Current (I_C): 150 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total Device Power Dissipation (P_D): 240 mW
  - LED Power Dissipation: 90 mW
  - Detector Power Dissipation: 150 mW

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Storage Temperature (T_STG): -40 to +125 °C
  - Ambient Operating Temperature (T_A): -40 to +100 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - 8-pin SOIC (Small Outline Integrated Circuit)

- **Special Features:**
  - Low LED input current required for easier logic interfacing.
  - Safety and regulatory approvals including UL1577 (2500 V AC RMS for 1 minute) and DIN EN/IEC 60747-5-5.
  - Pb-Free device.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level: 1 (according to JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The MOCD217M is commonly used in:
- Feedback control circuits
- Interfacing and coupling systems of different potentials and impedances
- General-purpose switching circuits
- Monitor and detection circuits

This optocoupler is particularly useful in applications where electrical isolation is required between different parts of a system, such as in power management and signal processing tasks. Its dual-channel design allows for efficient use in compact electronic designs, enhancing functionality while maintaining safety standards.
