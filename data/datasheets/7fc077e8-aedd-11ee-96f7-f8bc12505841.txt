- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided text.

**Description:**
The NTCS0805E3104JMT is a glass-protected SMD chip thermistor with a negative temperature coefficient (NTC). This means that its resistance decreases as the temperature increases. The device is designed for surface mount technology (SMT) applications and features matte tin (Sn) plated terminations. It is unmarked, which is typical for thermistors.

**Typical Applications:**
This thermistor is used for temperature sensing, protection, and compensation in various applications, including:
- Automotive systems (e.g., in-car entertainment, battery chargers).
- Industrial equipment.
- Telecommunications devices.
- Consumer electronics (e.g., office equipment, power supplies).
- LCD compensation.

The NTCS0805E3104JMT is particularly useful in applications where precise temperature measurement and control are critical, making it suitable for a wide range of electronic devices and systems.
