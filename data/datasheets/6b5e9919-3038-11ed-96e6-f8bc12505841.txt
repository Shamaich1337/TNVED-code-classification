C | Page 3 of 44 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD9958 consists of two DDS cores that provide indepen-\ndent frequency, phase, and amplitude control on each channel. This flexibility can be used to correct imbalances between signals due to analog processing, such as filtering, amplification, \nor PCB layout related mismatches. Because both channels share \na common system clock, they are inherently synchronized. \nSynchronization of multiple devices is supported. \nThe AD9958 can perform up to a 16-level modulation of \nfrequency, phase, or amplitude (FSK, PSK, ASK). Modulation is performed by applying data to the profile pins. In addition, the AD9958 also supports linear sweep of frequency, phase, or amplitude for applications such as radar and instrumentation. \nThe AD9958 serial I/O port offers multiple configurations to \nprovide significant flexibility. The serial I/O port offers an SPI-\ncompatible mode of operation that is virtually identical to the SPI operation found in earlier Analog Devices, Inc., DDS products. Flexibility is provided by four data pins (SDIO_0/ SDIO_1/SDIO_2/SDIO_3) that allow four programmable modes of serial I/O operation. \nThe AD9958 uses advanced DDS technology that provides low \npower dissipation with high performance. The device incorporates \ntwo integrated, high speed 10-bit DACs with excellent wideband and narrow-band SFDR. Each channel has a dedicated 32-bit frequency tuning word, 14 bits of phase offset, and a 10-bit \noutput scale multiplier.  The DAC outputs are supply referenced and must be termin-\nated into AVDD by a resistor or an AVDD center-tapped transformer. Each DAC has its own programmable reference to \nenable different full-scale currents for each channel. \nThe DDS acts as a high resolution frequency divider with the \nREFCLK as the input and the DAC providing the output. The \nREFCLK input source is common to both channels and can be \ndriven directly or used in combination with an integrated REFCLK multiplier (PLL) up to a maximum of 500 MSPS. The PLL multiplication factor is programmable from 4 to 20, in integer steps. The REFCLK input also features an oscillator \ncircuit to support an external crystal as the REFCLK source. \nThe crystal must be between 20 MHz and 30 MHz. The crystal \ncan be used in combination with the REFCLK multiplier. \nThe AD9958 comes in a space-saving 56-lead LFCSP package. \nThe DDS core (AVDD and DVDD pins) is powered by a 1.8 V supply. The digital I/O interface (SPI) operates at 3.3 V and requires the pin labeled DVDD_I/O (Pin 49) be connected  to 3.3 V . \nThe AD9958 operates over the industrial temperature range of \n−40°C to +85°C. \n \n \nFigure 2.

C | Page 18 of 44 THEORY OF OPERATION\nDDS CORE  \nThe AD9958 has two DDS cores , each consisting of a 32 -bit \nphase accumulator and phase -to-amplitude converter. Together, \nthese digital blocks generate a digital sine wave when the phase \naccumulator is clocked and the phase increment value  (frequency \ntuning word) is greater than 0. The phase -to-amplitude converter  \nsimultaneously translates phase information to amplitude information by a cos (θ) operation.   \nThe output frequency ( f\nOUT) of each DDS channel is a function \nof the rollover rate of each phase accumulator. The exact \nrelationship is given in the following equation:  \n322))( (S\nOUTf FTWf=\n \nwhere:  \nfS is the system clock rate . \nFTW  is the frequency tuning word  and is 0 ≤ FTW ≤ 231. \n232 represents the phase accumulator  capacity.  \nBecause  both  channels share a common system clock, they are \ninherently synchronized.  \nThe DDS core architecture also supports the capability to phase \noffset the output signal , which is performed by the channel \nphase offset word (CPOW). The CPOW is a 14 -bit register tha t \nstores a phase offset value. This value is added to the output of the phase accumulator to offset the current phase of the output signal. Each channel has its own phase offset word register. This feature can be used for placing all channels in a known ph ase \nrelationship relative to one another. The exact value of phase \noffset is given by the following equation:  \n°×\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb=Φ 360214POW\n DIGITAL -TO-ANALOG  CONVERTER  \nThe AD9958 incorporates four 10 -bit current output DACs. \nThe DAC converts a digital code (ampl itude) into a discrete \nanalog quantity. The DAC current outputs can be modeled as a \ncurrent source with high output impedance (typically 100 kΩ). Unlike many DACs, these current outputs require termination \ninto AVDD via a resistor or a center -tapped transf ormer for \nexpected current flow.  \nEach DAC has complementary outputs that provide a combined \nfull-scale output current (I\nOUT + IOUT). The outputs always sink \ncurrent , and their sum equals the full -scale current at any point \nin time. The full -scale current is controlled by means of an \nexternal resistor (R SET) and the scalable DAC current control \nbits discussed in the Modes of Operation  section. The resistor , \nRSET, is connected between the DAC_RSET pin and analog \nground (AGND). The full- scale current is inversely  proportional \nto the resistor value as follows:  \n(max)91.18\nOUTSETIR=\n \nThe maximum full -scale output current of the combined DAC \noutputs is 15 mA, but limiting the output to 10 mA provides \noptimal spurious -free dynamic range (SFDR) performance.  \nThe DAC output voltage compliance range is AVDD + 0.5 V to \nAVDD − 0.5 V . Voltages d eveloped beyond this range may  cause \nexcessive harmonic distortion. Proper attention should be paid to the load termination to keep the output voltage within its compliance range. Exceeding this range could potentially dam -\nage the DAC output circuitry.  \n \nFigure 32.

C | Page 19 of 44 MODES OF OPERATION \nThere are many combinations of modes (for example, single -\ntone, modulation, linear sweep) that the AD9958 can perform \nsimultaneously. However, some modes require multiple data \npins, which can impose limitations. The following guidelines can help determine if a specific combination of modes can be performed simultaneously by the AD9958. \nCHANNEL CONSTRAINT G UIDELINES  \n• Single -tone mode , two-level modulation  mode , and linear \nswee p mode c an be enabled on either channel and in any \ncombination simultaneously.  \n• Both channels can perform four -level modulation \nsimultaneously.  \n• Either channel can perform eight -level or 16 -level \nmodulation. The other channel can only be in single -tone \nmode.  \n• The RU/RD function can be used on both channels in single -tone mode. See the Output Amplitude Control \nMode  section for the RU/RD function.  \n• When Profile Pin P2 and Profile Pin P3 are used for \nRU/RD, either channel can perform two -level modulation \nwith RU/RD or both channels can perform linear \nfrequency or phase sweep with RU/RD.  \n• When Profile Pin P3 is used for RU/RD,  either channel can \nbe used in eight -level modulation with RU/RD. The other \nchannel can only be in single -tone mode.  \n• When SDIO_ 1, SDI O_2, and SDIO_3  pins are used for \nRU/RD, either or both channels can perform two -level \nmodulation with RU/RD. If one channel is not in two -level \nmodulation,  it can only be in single -tone mode.  \n• When the SDIO_1, SDIO_2, and SDIO_3 pins are used for \nRU/RD, e ither or both channels can perform four -level \nmodulation with R U/RD. If one channel is not in four -level \nmodulation,  it can only be in single -tone mode.  \n• When the SDIO_1, SDIO_2, and SDIO_3 pins are used for RU/RD, either channel can perform eight -level modulation \nwith RU/RD. The other channel can only be in single -tone \nmode.  \n• When the SDIO_1, SDIO_2, and SDIO_3 pins are used for RU/RD, either channel can perform 16 -level modulation with \nRU/RD. The other channel can only be in single -tone mode.  \n• Amplitude m odulation, linear amplitude sweep modes, \nand the RU/RD function cannot operate simultaneously, \nbut frequency and phase modulation can operate \nsimultaneously with the RU/RD function.  \n POWER SUPPLIES  \nThe AVDD and DVDD supply pins provide power to the DDS core and supporting analog circuitry. These pins connect to a \n1.8 V nominal power supply.  \nThe DVDD_I/O pin connects to a 3.3 V nominal power supply. All digital inputs are 3.3 V logic except for the  CLK_MODE_SEL \ninput. CLK_MODE_SEL (Pin 24) is an analog inpu t and should \nbe operated by 1.8 V logic.  \nSINGLE -TONE MODE  \nSingle -tone mode is the default mode of operation after a  master \nreset signal. In this mode, both DDS channels share a  common \naddress location for the frequency tuning word (Register 0x04) and phase  offset word (Register 0x05). Channel enable bits are \nprovided in combina tion with these shared addresses. As a \nresult, the frequency tuning word and/or phase offset word can be independently programmed between channels (see the follow -\ning Step 1 through Step 5). The channel enable bits do not \nrequire an I/O update to enable or disable a channel.  \nSee the Register Maps and Bit Descriptions  section for a \ndescription of the channel enable bits in the channel select \nregister (CSR, Register 0x00). The channel enable bits are \nenabled or disabled immediately after the CSR data byte is \nwritten.  \nAddress sharing enables channels to be written simultaneously, if desired. The defa ult state enables all channel enable bits. \nTherefore, the frequency tuning word and/or phase offset word \nis common to all channels but written only once through the \nserial I/O port.  \nThe following steps present a basic protocol to program a different freque ncy tuning word and/or phase offset word for \neach channel using the channel enable bits.  \n1. Power up the DUT and issue a master reset. A master \nreset places the part in single -tone mode and single -\nbit mode for serial programming operations (refer to the \nSerial I/O Modes of Operation  section). Frequency \ntuning words and phase offset words default to 0 at this point.  \n2. Enable only one channel enable bit (Register 0x00) \nand disable the other channel enable bit.  \n3. Using the serial I/O port, program the desired frequency tuning word (Register 0x04) and/or the \nphase offset word (Register 0x05) for the enabled \nchannel.  \n4. Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 for each channel.  \n5. Send an I/O update signal. After an I/O update, all channels should output their programmed frequency and/or phase offset value s. \nAD9958  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 20 of 44 Single -Tone Mode —Matched Pipeline Delay  \nIn single -tone mode, the AD9958 offers matched pipeline delay \nto the DAC input for all  frequency, phase, and amplitude  changes. \nThis avoids having to deal with different pipeline delays  between \nthe three input ports for such applications. The feature is enabled \nby asserting the matched p ipe delays active  bit found in the \nchannel function r egister (CF R, Register 0x03). This feature  \nis available in single -tone  mode only.  \nREFERENCE CLOCK MODE S \nThe AD9958 supports multiple reference clock configurations \nto generate the internal system clock. As an alternative  to \nclocking the part directly with a high frequency clock source, \nthe system clock can  be generated using the internal, PLL -based \nreference clock multiplier. An on -chip oscillator circuit is also \navailable for providing a low frequency reference signal by connecting a crystal to the clock i nput pins. Enabling these \nfeatures allows the part to operate with a low frequency clock source and still provide a high update rate for the DDS and DAC. However, using the clock multiplier changes the output \nphase noise characteristics. For best phase noise performance,  \na clean, stable clo ck with a high slew is required  (see Figure 17 \nand Figure 18). \nEnabling the PLL allows multiplication of the reference clock frequency from 4× to 20×, in integer steps. The PLL  multipli ca-\ntion value is represented by a 5 -bit multiplier value. These bit s \nare located in Function Register 1  (FR1, Register 0x01),  Bits[ 22:18 ] \n(see the Register Maps and Bit Descriptions  section ). \nWhen  FR1[22:18]  is programmed with values  ranging from  \n4 to 20 (decimal), the clock multiplier is enabled. The integer value in the register represents the multiplication factor. The \nsystem clock rate with the clock multiplier enabled is equal to \nthe reference clock rate multiplied by th e multiplication factor. \nIf FR1 [22:18]  is programmed with a value less than 4 or greater \nthan 20, the clock multiplier is disabled and the multiplication \nfactor is effectively 1.  \nWhenever the PLL clock multiplier is enabled or  the multipli ca-\ntion value is changed, time should be allowed to lock the PLL (typically 1  ms).  \nNote that the output frequency of the PLL is restricted to a \nfrequency range of 100 MHz to 500 MHz. However, there is a \nVCO gain control bit that must be used appropriately. The  VCO \ngain control bit defines two ranges (low/high) of frequency  \noutput. The VCO gain control bit defaults to low (see  Table 1  \nfor details).  The charge pump current in the PLL defaults to 75 µA. This setting typically produces the best phase noise characteristics. Increasing the charge pump current may degrade phase noise, but it decreases the lock time and changes the loop bandwidth.  \nEnabling the on- chip oscillat or for crystal operation is  performed \nby driving CLK_MODE_SEL (Pin 24) to logic high (1.8 V logic). With the on -chip oscillator enabled, connection of an \nexternal crystal to the REF_CLK and \nREF_CLK  inputs is made, \nproducing a low frequency reference clo ck. The frequency of \nthe crystal must be in the range of 20 MHz to 30  MHz.  \nTable 4 summarizes the clock modes of operation. See Table 1 \nfor more details.  \nReference Clock Input Circuitry  \nThe reference clock input circuitry has two modes of operation \ncontrolled by the logic state of Pin 24 ( CLK_MODE_SEL). The \nfirst mode (logic low)  configures as an input buffer. In this \nmode, the reference clock must be ac -coupled to the input due \nto internal dc biasing. This mode supports either differential  \nor single -ended configurations. If single -ended mode is chosen, \nthe complementary referenc e clock input (Pin 2 2) should be \ndecoupled to AVDD or AGND via a 0.1 µF capacitor. Figure 33 \nto Figure 35 exemplify typical reference clock configurations for \nthe AD9958. \n \nFigure 33. Differential Coupling from  Single- Ended Source  \nThe reference clock inputs can also suppo rt an LVPECL or \nPECL driver as the reference clock source.  \n \nFigure 34. Differential Clock Source Hook -Up \nThe second mode of operation (Pin 24 = logic high = 1.8 V) \nprovides an internal oscillator for crystal operation. In this mode, both clock inputs are dc -coupled via the crystal leads  \nand are bypassed. The range of crystal frequencies supported is \nfrom 20 MHz to 30 MHz. Figure 35 shows the configuration  \nfor using a crystal. \nTable 4.

C | Page 21 of 44  \nFigure 35. Crystal Input Configuration  \nSCALABLE DAC REFEREN CE CURRENT CONTROL \nMODE  \nRSET is common to all four DACs. As a result, the full- scale \ncurrents are equal by default. The scalable DAC reference can \nbe used to set the full-scale current of each DAC independent  \nfrom one another. This is accomplished by using the register bits CFR [9:8]. Table 5 shows how each DAC can be indivi dually \nscaled for independent channel control. This scaling provides \nfor binary attenuation.  \nTable 5. DAC Full -Scale Current Control  \nCFR [9:8]  LSB Current State  \n11  Full scale  \n01 Half scale  \n10 Quarter scale  \n00  Eighth scale  \nPOWER -DOWN FUNCTIONS  \nThe AD9958 supports an externally controlled power -down \nfeature and the more common software programmable power -\ndown bits found in previous Analog Devices  DDS products.  \nThe software control power -down allows the input clock circui -\ntry, the DAC, and the digital logic  (for each separate channel) to \nbe individually powered down via unique control bits  (CFR [7:6]). \nThese bits are not active when the externally controlled power -\ndown pin (PWR_DWN_CTL) is high. When the input pin , \nPWR_DWN_CTL , is high, the AD9958 enters a po wer-down \nmode based on the FR1 [6] bit. When the PWR_DWN_CTL \ninput pin is low, the external power -down control is inactive.  \nWhen FR1 [6] = 0 and the PWR_DWN_CTL input pin is high, \nthe AD9958 is put into a fast recovery power -down mode. In \nthis mode, the digi tal logic and the DAC digital logic are  powered \ndown. The DAC bias circuitry, PLL, oscillator, and clock input \ncircuitry are not powered down.  When FR1 [6] = 1 and the PWR_DWN_CTL input pin is high, \nthe AD9958 is put into full power -down mode. In this mode, all \nfunctions are powered down. This includes the DAC and PLL, \nwhich take a significant amount of time to power up. When the \nPLL is bypassed, the PLL is shut down to conserve power.  \nWhen the PWR_DWN_CTL inpu t pin is high, the individual \npower -down bits (CFR [7:6]) and (FR1 [7]) are invalid (don’t \ncare) and unused. When the PWR_DWN_CTL input pin is low, the individual pow er-down bits control the power -down modes \nof operation.  \nNote that the power -down signa ls are  all designed such that \nLogic 1 indicates the low power mode and Logic 0 indicates the powered -up mode.  \nMODULATION MODE  \nThe AD9958 can perform 2 -/4-/8-/16-level modulation of \nfrequency, phase, or amplitude. Modulation is achieved by \napplying data to the profile pins. Each channel can be program -\nmed separately, but the ability to modulate multiple channels \nsimultaneously is constrained by the limited number of profile pins. For instance, 16 -level modulation uses all four profile pins, \nwhich inhib its modula tion for the remaining channel . \nIn addition, the AD9958 has the ability to ramp up or ramp \ndown the output amplitude before, during, or after a  modulation \n(FSK, PSK only) sequence. This is performed by using the 10 -bit \noutput scalar. If the RU/RD feature i s desired, unused profile \npins or unused SDIO_1 /SDIO_2/SDIO_ 3 pins can be confi -\ngured to initiate the operation. See the Output Amplitude \nControl Mode  section for mor e details of the RU/RD feature.  \nIn modulation mode, each channel has its own set of control bits to determine the type (frequency, phase, or amplitude)  \nof modulation. Each channel has 16 profile (channel word) \nregisters for flexibility. Register 0x0A thro ugh Register 0x18  \nare profile registers for modulation of frequency, phase, or amplitude. Register  0x04, Register 0x05, and Register 0x06  \nare dedicated registers for frequency, phase, and amplitude, \nrespectively. These registers contain the first frequen cy, phase \noffset, and amplitude word.  \nFrequency modulation has 32-bit resolution, phase  modula tion is \n14 bits, and amplitude is 10 bits. When modulating phase or \namplit ude, the word value must be MSB aligned in the profile \n(channel word) registers and the unused bits are don’t care bits.  \n REF_CLK\nPIN 23\n25MHz\nXTALREF_CLK\nPIN 2239pF\n39pF\n05252-119\nAD9958  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

This is con trolled by \nthe profile pin c onfiguration ( PPC)  bits (FR1 [14:12] ).

Table 9 displays how the profile pins \nand channels are assigned.  \nAs shown in Table 9, only Profile Pin P2  can be used to  modulate \nChannel 0. If  frequency modulation is selected and  Profile Pin P2 \nis Logic 0, Channel Frequency Tuning Word 0  (Register 0x04) is \nchosen ; if Profil e Pin P2 is Logic 1, Channel Word 1  (Register \n0x0A) is chosen.  \nFour -Level Modulation —No RU/RD  \nThe m odulation level bits are set to 01 (four -level).

C | Page 25 of 44 LINEAR SWEEP MODE \nLinear sweep mode enables the user to sweep frequency, phase, \nor amplitude from a starting point (S0) to an endpoint (E0). \nThe purpose of linear sweep mode is to provide better band-width containment compared to direct modulation by replacing \ngreater instantaneous changes with more gradual, user-defined \nchanges between S0 and E0. \nIn linear sweep mode, S0 is loaded into the Channel Word 0 \nregister (S0 is represented by one of three registers: Register 0x04, Register 0x05, or Register 0x06, depending on the type of sweep) and E0 is always loaded into Channel Word 1 (Register 0x0A).  If E0 is configured for frequency sweep, the resolution is 32 bits, phase sweep is 14 bits, and amplitude sweep is 10 bits. When \nsweeping phase or amplitude, the word value must be MSB aligned \nin the Channel W ord 1 register. The unused bits are don’t care bits. The profile pins are used to trigger and control the direction of the linear sweep for frequency, phase, and amplitude. All channels can be programmed separately for a linear sweep. In \nlinear sweep mode, Profile Pin P2 is dedicated to Channel 0. \nProfile Pin P3 is dedicated to Channel 1. \nThe AD9958 has the ability to ramp up or ramp down (RU/RD) \nthe output amplitude (using the 10-bit output scalar) before and after a linear sweep. If the RU/RD feature is desired, unused profile pins or unused SDIO_1/SDIO_2/SDIO_3 pins can be \nconfigured for the RU/RD operation. \nTo enable linear sweep mode for a particular channel, the AFP \nselect bits (CFR[23:22]), the mo dulation level bits (FR1[9:8]), \nand the linear sweep enable bit (CFR[14]) are programmed.  \nThe AFP select bits determine the type of linear sweep to be \nperformed. The modulation level bits must be set to 00 (two-\nlevel) for that specific channel (see Table 19 and Table 20) \nTable 19.

The resolution of the \ndelta-tuning word is 32 bits for frequency, 14 bits for phase, and 10 bits for amplitude. The resolution for the delta ramp rate \nword is eight bits. \nIn linear sweep, each channel is assigned a rising delta word \n(RDW , Register 0x08) and a rising sweep ramp rate word (RSRR, Register 0x07). These settings apply when sweeping up \ntoward E0. The falling delta word (FDW , Register 0x09) and \nfalling sweep ramp rate (FSRR, Register 0x07) apply when sweeping down toward S0. Figure 36 displays a linear sweep up and then down using a profile pin. Note that the linear sweep no-dwell bit is disabled; otherwise, the sweep accumulator returns to 0 upon reaching E0. \n \nFigure 36. Linear Sweep Parameters \nFor a piecemeal or a nonlinear transition between S0 and E0, \nthe delta-tuning words and ramp rate words can be repro-\ngrammed during the transition to produce the desired response. \nThe formulas for calculating the step size of RDW or FDW for \ndelta frequency, delta phase, or delta amplitude are as follows: \nSYSCLKRDWf \uf0b4\uf0f7\uf0f8\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf03d \uf044322(Hz) \n\uf0b0 \uf0b4\uf0f7\uf0f8\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf03d 360214RDWΔΦ  \n1024210\uf0b4\uf0f7\uf0f8\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf03d \uf044RDWa  (DAC full-scale current) \nThe formula for calculating delta time from RSRR or FSRR is \n\uf028\uf029 CLK SYNC RSRR t _ / 1\uf0b4\uf03d  \nAt 500 MSPS operation (SYNC_CLK = 125 MHz), the maxi-\nmum time interval between steps is 1/125 MHz × 256 = 2.048 μs. \nThe minimum time interval is (1/125 MHz) × 1 = 8.0 ns. \nThe sweep ramp rate block (timer) consists of a loadable 8-bit \ndown counter that continuously counts down from the loaded value to 1. When the ramp rate timer equals 1, the proper ramp rate \nvalue is loaded and the counter begins counting down to 1 again. \n(FREQUENCY/PHASE/AMPLITUDE)\nLINEAR SWEEPRDW\nRSRR FSRR∆f,p,aFDW\nTIMES0E0\nPROFILE PIN∆f,p,a\n∆t ∆t\n05252-120\nAD9958 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 26 of 44 This load and countdown operation continues for as long as the \ntimer is enabled. However, the count can be reloaded before \nreaching 1 by either of the following two methods: \n\uf0b7 Method 1 is to change the profile pin. When the profile pin \nchanges from Logic 0 to Logic 1, the rising sweep ramp rate (RSRR) register value is loaded into the ramp rate timer, \nwhich then proceeds to count down as normal. When the \nprofile pin changes from Logic 1 to Logic 0, the falling sweep ramp rate (FSRR) register value is loaded into the ramp rate timer, which then proceeds to count down as normal. \n\uf0b7 Method 2 is to set the CFR[13] bit and issue an I/O update.  \nIf linear sweep is enabled and CFR[13] is set, the ramp rate \ntimer loads the value determined by the profile pin. If the profile pin is high, the ramp rate timer loads the RSRR; if the profile pin is low, the ramp rate timer loads FSRR. \nFrequency Linear Sweep Example: AFP Bits = 10 \nIn the following example, the modulation level bits (FR1[9:8]) = 00, \nthe linear sweep enable bit (CFR[14]) = 1, and the linear sweep \nno-dwell bit (CFR[15]) = 0. \nIn linear sweep mode, when the profile pin transitions from low \nto high, the RDW is applied to the input of the sweep accumulator \nand the RSRR register is loaded into the sweep rate timer. \nThe RDW accumulates at the rate given by the rising sweep \nramp rate (RSRR) bits until the output is equal to the CW1 \nregister value. The sweep is then complete, and the output is \nheld constant in frequency. When the profile pin transitions from high to low, the FDW is \napplied to the input of the sweep accumulator and the FSRR bits \nare loaded into the sweep rate timer. \nThe FDW accumulates at the rate given by the falling sweep ramp \nrate (FSRR) until the output is equal to the CFTW0 register (Register 0x04) value. The sweep is then complete, and the output is held constant in frequency. \nSee Figure 37 for the linear sweep block diagram. Figure 39 \ndepicts a frequency sweep with no-dwell mode disabled. In this \nmode, the output follows the state of the profile pin. A phase or \namplitude sweep works in the same manner. \nLINEAR SWEEP NO-DWELL MODE \nIf the linear sweep no-dwell bit is set (CFR[15]), the rising sweep is \nstarted in an identical manner to the dwell linear sweep mode; \nthat is, upon detecting Logic 1 on the profile input pin, the rising sweep action is initiated. The word continues to sweep up at the \nrate set by the rising sweep ramp rate at the resolution set by the \nrising delta word until it reaches the terminal value. Upon reaching the terminal value, the output immediately reverts to the starting \npoint and remains until Logic 1 is detected on the profile pin.  \nFigure 38 shows an example of the no-dwell mode. The points \nlabeled A indicate where a rising edge is detected on the profile pin, and the points labeled B indicate where the AD9958 has \ndetermined that the output has reached E0 and reverts to S0. \nThe falling sweep ramp rate bits (LSRR[15:8]) and the falling \ndelta word bits (FDW[31:0]) are unused in this mode. \n \n \n \nFigure 37.

The first  \nis a continuous zeroing of the sweep logic and phase accumula-\ntor (clear and hold). The second is a clear and release or automatic zeroing function. CFR[4] is the autoclear sweep accumulator bit and CFR[2] is the autoclear phase accumulator bit. The continuous clear bits are located in CFR, where CFR[3] clears the sweep accumulator and CFR[1] clears the phase accumulator. Continuous Clear Bits \nThe continuous clear bits are static control signals that, when \nactive high, hold the respective accumulator at 0 while the bit is \nactive. When the bit goes low, the respective accumulator is \nallowed to operate. \nClear and Release Bits \nThe autoclear sweep accumulator bit, when set, clears and \nreleases the sweep accumulator upon an I/O update or a change \nin the profile input pins. The autoclear phase accumulator bit, when set, clears and releases the phase accumulator upon an I/O update or a change in the profile pins. The automatic \nclearing function is repeated for every subsequent I/O update or \nchange in profile pins until the clear and release bits are reset \nvia the serial port.

C | Page 28 of 44 OUTPUT AMPLITUDE CON TROL MODE  \nThe 10 -bit scale factor (multiplier) controls the ramp -up and \nramp -down (RU/RD) time of an on/off emission from the  DAC.  \nIn burst transmissions of digital data, it reduces the adverse \nspectral impact of abrupt bursts of data. The multiplier can  \nbe bypassed by clearing the a mplitude multiplier enable bit \n(ACR [12] = 0).  \nAutomatic and manual RU/RD modes are supported. The auto -\nmatic mode generates a zero -scale up to a full -scale (10 bits) \nlinear ramp at a rate determined by ACR  (Register  0x06) . The \nstart and direction of the ramp can be controlled by either the profile pins o r the SDIO _1/SDIO_2/SDIO_ 3 pins.  \nManual mode allows the user to directly control the output amplitude by manually writing to the amplitude scale factor value in the ACR  (Register 0x06).  Manual mode is enabled by \nsetting ACR [12] = 1 and ACR [11] = 0. \nAutomatic RU/RD Mode Operation  \nAutomatic RU/RD mode is active when both ACR [12] and \nACR [11] are set. When automatic RU/RD is enabled, the scale \nfactor is internally generated and applied to the multiplier input port for scaling the output. The scale factor is the output of a  10-bit \ncounter that increments/decrements at a rate set by the 8 -bit \noutput ramp rate register. The scale factor increments if the external pin is high and decrements if the pin is low. The inter -\nnally generated scale factor step size i s controlled by ACR [15:14] . \nTable 21 describes the increment/decrement step size of the \ninternally generated scale factor per ACR [15:14] . \nTable 21.

This allows the user to ramp to a value \nless than full scale.  \nRamp Rate Timer  \nThe ramp rate timer is a loadable down counter that generates the clock signal to the 10 -bit counter that generates the internal \nscale factor. The ra mp r ate timer is loaded with the value of \nACR[23:16] each time the counter reaches 1  (decimal). This load \nand countdown  operation  continues for as long as the timer is \nenabled unless the timer is forced to load before reaching a count of 1.  \nIf the load ARR at I/O_UPDATE bit (ACR [10]) is set, the ramp \nrate timer is loaded at an I/O update, a change in profile input, or upon reaching a value of 1. The ramp timer can be loaded \nbefore reaching a count of 1 by three methods.  \n• In the first method, the  profi le pin s or the SDIO_1 / \nSDIO_2/SDIO_ 3 pins are changed. When the control \nsignal changes state, the ACR value is loaded into the ramp rate timer, which then proceeds to count down as normal.  \n• In the second method, the load ARR at I/O_UPDATE bit (ACR [10]) is s et, and an I/O update is issued.  \n• The third method is to  chang e from inactive auto matic  \nRU/RD mode to active auto matic  RU/RD mode.  \nRU/RD Pin -to-Channel Assignment  \nWhen all four channels are in single -tone  mode, the profile pins \nare used for RU/RD operation.  \nWhen linear sweep and RU/RD are activated, the SDIO_1 / \nSDIO_2/SDIO_ 3 pins are used for RU/RD operation.  \nIn modulation mode, refer to the Modulation Mode  section for \npin assignments.  \nTable 22.

C | Page 29 of 44 SYNCHRONIZING MULTIPLE AD9958 DEVICES \nThe AD9958 allows easy synchronization of multiple AD9958 \ndevices. At power -up, the phase of SYNC_CLK can be offset \nbetween multiple devices. To correct for the offset and align the \nSYNC_CLK edges, there are three methods (one automatic  mode \nand two manual modes) of synchronizing the SYNC_CLK  edges . \nThese modes force the internal state machines of multiple \ndevices to a known state, which aligns the SYNC_CLK  edges . \nIn addition, the user must send a coincident I/O_ UPDATE to \nmultiple devices to maintain synchronization. Any mismatch in REF_CLK phase between devices results in a corresponding phase mismatch on the SYNC_CLK edge s.  \nAUTOMATIC MODE SYNCHRONIZATION  \nIn automatic mode, multiple part synchronization is achieved by connecting the SYNC_OUT pin on the master device to the SYNC_IN pin s of the slave devices. Devi ces are configured as \nmaster or slave through programming bits, accessible via the serial port.  \nA configuration for synchronizing multiple AD9958 devices in \nautomatic mode is shown in the Application Circuits  section. In \nthis configuration, the AD9510 provides coincident REF_CLK and SYNC_OUT  signals to all devices.  \nOperation  \nThe first step is to program the master and slave devices for their respective roles  and then w rite the auto sync enable bit \n(FR2[7] = 1 . Enabling the master device is performed by writing \nits multidevice sync  master e nable  bit in Function Register 2  \n(FR2 [6]) = 1. This causes the SYNC_OUT of the master device \nto output a pulse that has a pulse width  equal to one system \nclock peri od and a frequency equal to one -fourth of the system \nclock freq uency . Enabling device s as slaves is per formed by \nwriting FR2[6] = 0. \nIn automatic synch ronizing mode, the slave device s sample \nSYNC_OUT pulses from the master device  on the SYNC_IN  \nof the slave devices , and a comparison of all state machines is \nmade by the autosynchronization circui try. If the slave device s \nstate machines are not identical to the master, the slave devices \nstate machines are stalled for one  system clock cycle. This proce -\ndure sy nchronizes the slave devices  within three SYNC_CLK \nperiods.  \nDelay Time Between SYNC_OUT and SYNC_IN  \nWhen the delay between SYNC_OUT and SYNC_IN exceeds \none system clock period, the system clock offset bits (FR2 [1:0]) \nare used to compensate. The default state of these bits is 00,  which \nimplies that the SYNC_OUT of the master and the SYNC_IN of the slave have a propagation delay of less than one system clock period. If the propagation time is greater than one system clock period, the time should be measured and the appropriate offset \nprogrammed.  Table 24 describes the delays required per system \nclock offset value.  Table 24. System Clock Offset (Delay) Assignment s \nSystem Clock  \nOffset (FR2 [1:0])  SYNC_OUT/SYNC_IN  \nPropagation Delay  \n00  0 ≤ delay ≤ 1  \n01  1 ≤ delay ≤ 2  \n10  2 ≤ delay ≤ 3  \n11  3 ≤ delay ≤ 4  \nAutomatic Synchronization Status Bits  \nIf a slave device falls out of sync, the sync status bit is set high. \nThe multidevice sync  status bit (FR2 [5]) can be read through \nthe serial port. It is automatically cleared when read.  \nThe synchronization routine continues to operat e regardless of \nthe st ate of FR2 [5]. FR2[5] can be masked by writing Logic 1 to \nthe multidevice sync mask bit (FR2 [4]). If FR2[5] is masked, it is \nheld low. \nMANUAL SOFTWARE MODE  SYNCHRONIZATION \nManual software mode is enabled by setting the manual  software \nsync  bit (FR1 [0]) to Logic 1 in a device. In this mode, the I/O \nupdate that writes the m anual software  sync bit to Logic 0 stalls \nthe state machine of the clock generator for one system clock \ncycle. Stalling the clock generation state machine by one cycle changes the phas e relationship of SYNC_CLK between devices \nby one system clock period (90°).  \nNote that the user may have to repeat this process until the devices have their SYNC_CLK signals in phase. The SYNC_IN input can be left floating because  it has an internal pull- up. The \nSYNC_OUT pin is not used.  \nThe synchronization is complete when the master and slave devices have their SYNC_CLK signals in phase.  \nMANUAL HARDWARE MODE  SYNCHRONIZATION \nManual hardware mode is enabled by setting the m anual  hardware  \nsync bit (FR1 [1]) to Logic 1 in a device. In manual hardware  \nsynchronization mode, the SYNC_CLK stalls by one system \nclock cycle each time a rising edge is detected on the SYNC_IN \ninput. Stalling the SYNC_CLK state machine by one cycle  changes \nthe phase relationship of SYNC _CLK between devices by one \nsystem clock period (90°).  \nNote that the user may have to repeat the process until the  devices \nhave their SYNC_CLK signals in phase. The SYNC_IN input can be left floating because  it has an internal pull- up. The \nSYNC_OUT is not used.  \nThe synchronization is com plete when the master and slave \ndevices have their SYNC_CLK signals in phase.  \nAD9958 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 30 of 44 I/O_UPDATE, SYNC_CLK, AND SYSTEM CLOCK \nRELATIONSHIPS \nI/O_UPDATE and SYNC_CLK are used together to transfer \ndata from the serial I/O buffer to the active registers in the \ndevice. Data in the buffer is inactive. \nSYNC_CLK is a rising edge active signal. It is derived from  \nthe system clock and a divide-by-4 frequency divider. The \nSYNC_CLK, which is externally provided, can be used to \nsynchronize external hardware to the AD9958 internal clocks. \nI/O_UPDATE initiates the start of a buffer transfer. It can be \nsent synchronously or asynchronously relative to the SYNC_CLK. If the setup time between these signals is met, then constant latency (pipeline) to the DAC output exists. For example, if repetitive changes to phase offset via the SPI port is desired, the latency of those changes to the DAC output is constant; otherwise, a time uncertainty of one SYNC_CLK period is present.  \nThe I/O_UPDATE is essentially oversampled by the SYNC_CLK. \nTherefore, I/O_UPDATE must have a minimum pulse width \ngreater than one SYNC_CLK period.  \nThe timing diagram shown in Figure 40 depicts when data in \nthe buffer is transferred to the active registers. \n \n \n \nFigure 40.

C | Page 31 of 44 SERIAL I/O PORT \nOVERVIEW \nThe AD9958 serial I/O port offers multiple configurations to \nprovide significant flexibility. The serial I/O port offers an SPI-\ncompatible mode of operation that is virtually identical to the SPI operation found in earlier Analog Devices DDS products. \nThe flexibility is provided by four data pins (SDIO_0, SDIO_1, \nSDIO_2, SDIO_3) that allow four programmable modes of \nserial I/O operation. \nThree of the four data pins (SDIO_1, SDIO_2, SDIO_3) can be \nused for functions other than serial I/O port operation. These pins can also be used to initiate a ramp-up or ramp-down (RU/RD) of the 10-bit amplitude output scalar. In addition, SDIO_3 can be used to provide the SYNC_I/O function that resynchronizes the serial I/O port controller if it is out of proper sequence. \nThe maximum speed of the serial I/O port SCLK is 200 MHz, \nbut the four data pins (SDIO_0, SDIO_1, SDIO_2, SDIO_3)  can be used to further increase data throughput. The maximum data throughput using all the SDIO pins (SDIO_0, SDIO_1, \nSDIO_2, SDIO_3) is 800 Mbps. \nNote that both channels share Register 0x03 to Register 0x18, \nwhich are shown in the Register Maps and Bit Descriptions \nsection. This address sharing enables both DDS channels to be \nwritten to simultaneously. For example, if a common frequency tuning word is desired for both channels, it can be written once through the serial I/O port to both channels. This is the default mode of operation (all channels enabled). To enable each channel to be independent, the two channel enable bits found in the channel select register (CSR, Register 0x00) must be used. \nThere are effectively four sets or copies of addresses (Register 0x03 \nto Register 0x18) that the channel enable bits can access to provide channel independence. See the Descriptions for Control Registers section for further details of programming channels that are common to or independent from each other. To properly read back Register 0x03 to Register 0x18, the user must enable only one channel enable bit at a time. \nSerial operation of the AD9958 occurs at the register level,  \nnot the byte level; that is, the controller expects that all bytes contained in the register address are accessed. The SYNC_I/O function can be used to abort an I/O operation, thereby allowing fewer than all bytes to be accessed. This feature can be used to program only a part of the addressed register. Note that only completed bytes are affected. \nThere are two phases to a serial communications cycle. Phase 1 \nis the instruction cycle, which writes the instruction byte into the AD9958. Each bit of the instruction byte is registered on each corresponding rising edge of SCLK. The instruction byte defines whether the upcoming data transfer is a write or read operation. The instruction byte contains the serial address of the address register. Phase 2 of the I/O cycle consists of the actual data transfer (write/read) between the serial port controller and the serial port buffer. The number of bytes transferred during this phase of the communication cycle is a function of the register being \naccessed. The actual number of additional SCLK rising edges \nrequired for the data transfer and instruction byte depends on the number of bytes in the register and the serial I/O mode of \noperation. \nFor example, when accessing Function Register 1 (FR1), which \nis three bytes wide, Phase 2 of the I/O cycle requires that three bytes be transferred. After transferring all data bytes per the \ninstruction byte, the communication cycle is completed for that \nregister. \nAt the completion of a communication cycle, the AD9958 serial \nport controller expects the next set of rising SCLK edges to be the instruction byte for the next communication cycle. All data written to the AD9958 is registered on the rising edge of SCLK. Data is read on the falling edge of SCLK (see Figure 43 through \nFigure 49). The timing specifications for Figure 41 and Figure 42 \nare described in Table 25. \n \nFigure 41. Setup and Hold Timing for the Serial I/O Port \n \nFigure 42.

C | Page 32 of 44 Each set of communication cycles does not require an I/O  update \nto be issued. The I/O update transfers data from the I/O port \nbuffer to active registers. The I/O update can be sent for each communication cycle or can be sent when all serial opera tions \nare complete. However, data is not active until an I/O upda te is \nsent, with the exception of the channel enable bits in the  channel \nselect register (CSR). These bits do not require an I/O update to \nbe enabled.  \nINSTRUCTION BYTE DES CRIPTION  \nThe instruction byte con tains the following information:  \nMSB        LSB \nD7 D6  D5  D4  D3  D2  D1  D0 \nR/W x1 x1 A4  A3  A2  A1  A0  \n \n1 x = don’t care bit.  \nBit D7 of the instruction byte (R/ W) determines whether a read \nor write data transfer occurs after the instruction byte write. A logic high ind icates a read operation. A logic low  indicates a \nwrite operation.  \nBit D4 to Bit D0 of the instruction byte determine which  register is \naccessed during the data transfer portion of the  communication \ncycle. The internal byte addresses are generated b y the AD9958. \nSERIAL I/O PORT PIN DESCRIPTION  \nSerial Data Clock (SCLK)  \nThe serial data clock pin is used to synchronize data to and \nfrom the internal state machines of the AD9958. The maximum \nSCLK toggle frequency is 200 MHz.  \nChip Select ( CS) \nThe chip select pin allows more than one AD9958 device to be \non the same set of serial communications lines. The chip select is an active low enable pin. SDIO_x  inputs go to a high imped -\nance state when \nCS is high. If CS is driven high during any \ncommunication cycle, that cycle is suspended until CS is \nreactivated low. The CS pin can be tied low in systems that \nmaintain control of SCLK.  \nSer ial Data I/O (SDIO_ x) \nOf the four SDIO pins, only the SDIO_ 0 pin is a dedicated  SDIO \npin. SDIO_1, SDIO_2 , and SDIO_3 can also  be used to ramp \nup/ramp down  the output amplitude. Bits[ 2:1] in the c hannel \nselect register (CSR , Register 0x00) control the configuration  \nof these pins. See the Serial I/O Modes of Operation  for more  \ninformation.  \nSERIAL I/O PORT FUNC TION DESCRIPTION  \nSerial Data Out (SDO)  \nThe SDO function is available in single -bit (3 -wire) mode only. \nIn SDO mode, data is read from the SDIO_2 pin for protocols that use separate lines for transmitting and receiving data ( see \nTable 26 for pin configuration options) . Bits[ 2:1] in the  channel \nselect  register (CSR, Register 0x00) control the configuration of this pin. The SDO function is not available in 2 -bit or 4 -bit serial \nI/O modes.  \nSYNC_I/O  \nThe SYNC_I /O function is available in 1 -bit and 2 -bit modes. \nSDIO_3 serves as the SYNC_I/O pin when this function is \nactive. Bits CSR [2:1] control the configuration of this pin. \nOtherwise,  the SYNC_I/O function is used to synchronize the \nI/O port state machines without  affecting the addressable register \ncontents. An active high input on the SYNC_I/O (SDIO_3) pin \ncauses the current communication cycle to abort. After SDIO_3 returns low (Logic 0), another communication cycle can begin, starting with the instruction byte write. The SYNC_I/O  function is \nnot available in 4 -bit serial I/O mode.  \nMSB/LSB TRANSFER DES CRIPTION  \nThe AD9958 serial port can support both most significant bit \n(MSB) first or least significant bit (LSB) first data formats. This functionality is controlled by CSR [0]. MSB first is the default \nmode. When CSR [0] is set high, the AD9958 serial port is in \nLSB first format. The instruction byte must be written in the format indicated by CSR [0], that is, if the AD9958 is in LSB first \nmode, the instruction byte must be written from LSB to MSB. If the AD9958 is in MSB first mode (default), the instruc tion byte \nmust be writ ten from MSB to LSB.  \nExample Operation  \nTo write Function Register 1 (FR1 , Register 0x01 ) in MSB first \nformat , apply an instruction byte of 00000001 starting with the \nMSB (in the  following example instruction byte , the MSB is \nD7). From this instruction, the internal controller recognizes a \nwrite transfer of three bytes starting with the MSB , FR1 [23]. \nBytes are written on each consecutive rising SCLK edge until  Bit 0 is transferred. When  the last data bit is written, the I/O \ncommunication cycle is complete and the next byte is  considered \nan instruction byte.  \nExample Instruction Byte1 \nMSB        LSB \nD7 D6 D5 D4  D3  D2  D1  D0 \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \n \n1 Note that the bit values are for example purposes only.  \nTo write Function Register 1 (FR1) in LSB first format, apply an instruction byte of 00000001 , starting with the LSB bit  (in the \npreceding example instruction byte, the LSB is D0) . From this \ninstruction, the internal controller recognizes a write transfer of three bytes, starting with the LSB , FR1[0]. Bytes are  written on \neach consecut ive rising SCLK edge until Bit 23 is transferred. \nWhen  the last data bit is written, the I/O communica tion cycle is \ncomplete and the next byte is considered an instruction byte . \nData Sheet  AD9958  \n \nRev. C | Page 33 of 44 SERIAL I/O MODES OF OPERATION  \nThe following are the four programmable modes of serial I/O \nport operation:  \n• Single -bit se rial 2 -wire mode (default mode)  \n• Single -bit serial 3 -wire mode  \n• 2-bit serial mode  \n• 4-bit seria l mode (SYNC_I/O not available)  \nTable 26 displays the function of all six serial I/O interface pins, \ndepending on the mode of serial I/O operation programmed.  \nTable 26.

Serial I/O Mode of Operation  \nSerial I/O Mode Select \n(CSR [2:1] ) Mode of Operation  \n00 Single -bit serial mode (2 -wire mode)  \n01 Single -bit serial mode (3 -wire mode)  \n10 2-bit serial mode  \n11 4-bit serial mode  \nSingle -Bit Serial (2 -Wire  and 3 -Wire) Modes  \nThe single -bit serial mode interface allows read/write access to \nall registers that configure the AD9958. MSB first or LSB first \ntransfer formats are supported. In addition, the single -bit serial \nmode interface port can be configured either as  a single pin I/O, \nwhich allows a 2 -wire interface , or as two unidirectional pins \nfor input/output , which en able a 3 -wire interface. Single- bit \nmode allows the use of the SYNC_I/O function.  In single -bit serial mode, 2 -wire interface operation, the \nSDIO_0 pin is the single serial data I/O pin. In single -bit serial \nmode 3 -wire interface operation, the SDIO_0 pin is the s erial \ndata input pin and the SDIO_2 pin is the output data pin. \nRegardless of the number of wires used in the interface, the \nSDIO_3 pin is configured as an input and operates as the SYNC_I/O pin in the single -bit serial mode and 2 -bit serial \nmode. The SDIO _1 pin is unused in this mode (s ee Table 26). \n2-Bit Serial Mode  \nThe SPI port operation in 2 -bit serial mode is identical to the \nSPI port operation in single -bit serial  mode, except that two bits \nof data are registered on each rising edge of SCLK. Therefore, it \nonly takes four clock cycles to transfer eight bits of information. \nThe SDIO_0 pin contains the even numbered data bits using the notation D [7:0], and the SDIO_1 pin contains the odd \nnumbered data bits. This even and odd numbered pin/data \nalignment is valid in both MSB and LSB first formats  (see \nFigure 44). \n4-Bit Serial Mode  \nThe SPI port in 4 -bit serial mode is iden tical to the SPI port in \nsingle -bit serial mode, except that four bits of data are registered \non each rising edge of SCLK. Therefore, it takes only two clock \ncycles to transfer eight bits of informati on. The SDIO_0 and \nSDIO_2 pins contain even numbered data bits using the  notation \nD[7:0], and the SDIO_0 pin contains the LSB of the nibble. The \nSDIO_1 and SDIO_3 pins contain the odd num bered data bits , \nand the SDIO_1 pin contains the LSB of the nibble to  be accessed.  \nNote that when programming the device for 4 -bit serial mode,  \nit is important to keep the SDIO_3 pin at Logic 0 until the  device is \nprogrammed out of the single -bit serial mode. Failure to do so \ncan result in the serial I/O port controller be ing out of \nsequence.  \nFigure 43 through Figure 45 represent write timing diagrams \nfor each of the serial I/O modes available. Both MSB and LSB \nfirst modes are shown. LSB fi rst bits are shown in parenthese s. \nThe clock stall low/high feature shown is not required. It is used \nto show that data (SDIO) must h ave the proper setup time \nrelative to the rising edge of SCLK.  \nFigure 46 through Figure 49 represent read timing diagrams for \neach of the serial I/O modes available. Both MSB and LSB first \nmodes are shown. LSB fi rst bits are shown in parenthese s. The \nclock stall low/high feature shown is not required. It is used to show that data (SDIO) must have the proper setup time relative to the rising edge of SCLK for the instruction byte and the read \ndata that follows the falling edge of SCLK.  \n \nAD9958  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.
