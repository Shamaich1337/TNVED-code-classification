It features a set gain of 20 V/V , with a maximum ±0.35% gain error over the entire temperature range. The buffered output voltage directly interfaces with any typical \nconverter.  The AD8217 offers excellent common-mode rejection \nfrom 4.5 V to 80 V , and includes an internal LDO, which directly powers the device from the high voltage rail. Therefore, no addi-tional supply is necessary, provided that the input common-mode range is 4.5 V to 80 V . The AD8217 performs unidirectional \ncurrent measurements across a shunt resistor in a variety of \nindustrial and telecom applications including motor control, \nbattery management, and base station power amplifier bias \ncontrol.  The AD8217 offers breakthrough performance throughout the \n−40°C to +125°C temperature range. It features a zero-drift core, which leads to a typical offset drift of ±100 nV/°C throughout the operating temperature and common-mode \nvoltage range. Special attention is devoted to output linearity \nbeing maintained throughout the input differential voltage range of 0 mV to 250 mV , regardless of the common-mode voltage \npresent, and the typical input offset voltage is ±100 μV .  \nThe AD8217 is offered in a 8-lead MSOP package and is \nspecified from −40°C to +125°C.  \n \n \n \nAD8217  \n \nRev.

A | Page 10 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nAMPLIFIER CORE \nIn typical applications, the AD8217 amplifies a small differential \ninput voltage generated by the load current flowing through  \na shunt resistor. The AD8217 rejects high common-mode vol-tages (up to 80 V) and provides a ground-referenced, buffered \noutput that interfaces with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). \nFigure 24  shows a simplified schematic of the AD8217. \nLDOLOAD\nR2R1\nV2ILOAD\nV1AD8217R4\nR3+IN\nGND–IN\nSHUNT OUT\n4.5V\nTO\n80V\n09161-024 \nFigure 24. Simpli fied Schematic \nThe AD8217 is configured as a difference amplifier. The \ntransfer function is  \nOUT  = (R4/R1) × (V1  − V2) \nResistors R4 and R1 are matched to within 0.01% and have \nvalues of 1.5 MΩ and 75 kΩ, re spectively, meaning an input  \nto output total gain of 20 V/V for the AD8217.  The AD8217 accurately amplifies the input differential signal, \nrejecting high voltage common modes ranging from 4.5 V to 80 V.  \nThe main amplifier uses a novel zero-drift architecture, providing \nthe end user with an extremely stable part over temperature. The offset drift is typically less  than ±100 nV/°C. This perfor-\nmance leads to optimal accuracy and dynamic range.  \nINTERNAL LDO \nThe AD8217 includes an internal LDO, which allows the device \nto power directly from the common-mode voltage at the inputs. \nNo additional standalone supply is necessary, provided that the \ncommon-mode voltage at the +IN pin is at least 4.5 V and up to 80 V. Once the common-mode volt age is above 5.6 V, the LDO \noutput reaches its maximum value, that is 5.6 V. This is also the maximum output voltage range of the AD8217. Because the \nAD8217 output typically interfaces  with a converter, the 5.6 V \nmaximum output range ensures the ADC input is not damaged \ndue to excessive overvoltage. \nThe input bias current flowing through Pin +IN powers the \ninternal LDO and, therefore, doubles as the supply current  for the AD8217. This current va ries depending on the input \ncommon-mode voltage. See Figure 8  for additional information. \n \n \n   AD8217\n \nRev.
