J | Page 3 of 68 | February 2014GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors are \nmembers of the Blackfin® family of products, incorporating the \nAnalog Devices, Inc./Intel Micr o Signal Architecture (MSA). \nBlackfin processors combine a dual-MAC, state-of-the-art sig-\nnal processing engine, the advant ages of a clean, orthogonal \nRISC-like microprocessor instruct ion set, and single-instruc-\ntion, multiple-data (SIMD) multimed ia capabilities into a single \ninstruction-set architecture.\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors are \ncompletely code and pin compat ible. They differ only with \nrespect to their performance, on -chip memory, and presence of \nthe Ethernet MAC module. Specif ic performance, memory, and \nfeature configurations are shown in Table 1 .\nBy integrating a rich set of indu stry-leading system peripherals \nand memory, the Blackfin processo rs are the platform of choice \nfor next-generation applications that require RISC-like pro-\ngrammability, multimedia suppo rt, and leading-edge signal \nprocessing in one integrated package.PORTABLE LOW POWER ARCHITECTURE\nBlackfin processors provide world-class power management \nand performance. They  are produced with a low power and low \nvoltage design methodology and feature on-chip dynamic \npower management, which is the ability to vary both the voltage \nand frequency of oper ation to significantl y lower overall power \nconsumption. This capability can result in a substantial reduc-\ntion in power consum ption, compared with just varying the \nfrequency of operation. This a llows longer battery life for \nportable appliances.\nSYSTEM INTEGRATION\nThe Blackfin processor is a highly integrated system-on-a-chip solution for the next generati on of embedded network-con-\nnected applications. By combining industry-standard interfaces \nwith a high performance signal processing core, cost-effective \napplications can be developed quickly, without the need for costly external components. The system peripherals include an \nIEEE-compliant 802.3 10/100 Ethernet MAC (ADSP-BF536 and \nADSP-BF537 only), a CAN 2.0B controller, a TWI controller, \ntwo UART ports, an SPI port, tw o serial ports (SPORTs), nine \ngeneral-purpose 32-bit timers (eight with PWM capability), a real-time clock, a watchdog timer, and a parallel peripheral \ninterface (PPI).\nBLACKFIN PROCESSOR PERIPHERALS\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/A DSP-BF537 processors con-\ntain a rich set of peripherals co nnected to the core via several \nhigh bandwidth buses, providing flexibility in system configura-\ntion as well as excellent overall system performance (see Figure 1 ). The processors contain dedicated network communi-\ncation modules and high speed serial and parallel ports, an \ninterrupt controller for flexible management of interrupts from \nthe on-chip peripherals or extern al sources, and power manage-\nment control functions to tailor the performance and power \ncharacteristics of the processor and system to many application \nscenarios.\nAll of the peripherals, except for the general-purpose I/O, CAN, \nTWI, real-time clock, and timers, are supported by a flexible \nDMA structure. There are also separate memory DMA channels \ndedicated to data transfers be tween the processor’s various \nmemory spaces, including external SDRAM and asynchronous \nmemory. Multiple on-chip buse s running at up to 133 MHz \nprovide enough bandwidth to keep the processor core running \nalong with activity on all of the on-chip and external \nperipherals.\nThe Blackfin processors include an on-chip voltage regulator in \nsupport of the processors’ dyna mic power management capabil-\nity. The voltage regulator provides  a range of core voltage levels \nwhen supplied from V\nDDEXT . The voltage regulator can be \nbypassed at the user’s discretion. Table 1.

The computation units \nprocess 8-, 16-, or 32-bit data  from the register file.\nThe compute register file contains eight 32-bit registers. When \nperforming compute operations  on 16-bit operand data, the \nregister file operates as 16 independent 16-bit registers. All \noperands for compute operations come from the multiported \nregister file and instruction constant fields.\nEach MAC can perform a 16-bit by 16-bit multiply in each \ncycle, accumulating the results into the 40-bit accumulators. \nSigned and unsigned formats, rounding, and saturation \nare supported.\nThe ALUs perform a traditional set of arithmetic and logical \noperations on 16-bit or 32-bit data. In addition, many special \ninstructions are included to acce lerate various signal processing \ntasks. These include bit operations such as field extract and pop-ulation count, modulo 2\n32 multiply, divide primitives, saturation \nand rounding, and sign/exponent detection. The set of video instructions include byte alignment and packing operations, \n16-bit and 8-bit adds with cli pping, 8-bit average operations, \nand 8-bit subtract/absolute value/accumulate (SAA) operations. Also provided are the compar e/select and vector search \ninstructions.\nFor certain instructions, two 16-bit ALU operations can be per-\nformed simultaneously on register  pairs (a 16-bit high half and \n16-bit low half of a co mpute register). If the second ALU is used, \nquad 16-bit operations are possible.\nThe 40-bit shifter can perform shifts and rotates, and is used to \nsupport normalization, field extract, and field deposit instructions.\nThe program sequencer controls the flow of instruction execu-\ntion, including instruction alignment and decoding. For \nprogram flow control, the sequ encer supports PC relative and \nindirect conditional jumps (with static branch prediction), and \nsubroutine calls. Hardware is provided to support zero-over-\nhead looping. The architecture is fully interlocked, meaning that the programmer need not manage  the pipeline when executing \ninstructions with data dependencies.\nFigure 2.

J | Page 5 of 68 | February 2014The address arithmetic unit prov ides two addresses for simulta-\nneous dual fetches from memory. It contains a multiported \nregister file consisti ng of four sets of 32-bit index, modify, \nlength, and base registers (for circular buffering), and eight \nadditional 32-bit pointer regist ers (for C-style indexed stack \nmanipulation).\nBlackfin processors support a modified Harvard architecture in \ncombination with a hierarchical memory structure. Level 1 (L1) \nmemories are those that typically operate at the full processor \nspeed with little or no latency. At the L1 level, the instruction \nmemory holds instructions only. The two data memories hold \ndata, and a dedicated scratchpad data memory stores stack and \nlocal variable information.\nIn addition, multiple L1 memory blocks are provided, offering a \nconfigurable mix of SRAM and cache. The memory manage-\nment unit (MMU) provides memory protection for individual \ntasks that may be operating on the core and can protect system registers from unintended access.\nThe architecture provides three modes of operation: user mode, \nsupervisor mode, and emulation mode. User mode has \nrestricted access to certain system resources, thus providing a \nprotected software environment,  while supervisor mode has \nunrestricted access to the system and co re resources.\nThe Blackfin processor instruct ion set has been optimized so \nthat 16-bit opcodes represent the most frequently used instruc-\ntions, resulting in excellent co mpiled code density. Complex \nDSP instructions are encoded into 32-bit opcodes, representing fully featured multifunction instructions. Blackfin processors \nsupport a limited multi-issue ca pability, where a 32-bit instruc-\ntion can be issued in parallel with two 16-bit instructions, allowing the programmer to use ma ny of the core resources in a \nsingle instruction cycle.\nThe Blackfin processor assembly language uses an algebraic syn-\ntax for ease of coding and readability. The architecture has been optimized for use in conjunction with the C/C++ compiler, \nresulting in fast and effici ent software implementations.\nMEMORY ARCHITECTURE\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors view \nmemory as a single unified 4G byte address space, using 32-bit \naddresses. All resources, includ ing internal memory, external \nmemory, and I/O control registers,  occupy separate sections of \nthis common address space. Th e memory portions of this \naddress space are arranged in a hi erarchical structure to provide \na good cost/performance balance of some very fast, low latency \non-chip memory as cache or SRAM, and larger, lower cost, and \nperformance off-chip memory systems. (See Figure 3 ).\nThe on-chip L1 memory system  is the highest performance \nmemory available to the Blackfin processor. The off-chip mem-ory system, accessed through the external bus interface unit \n(EBIU), provides expansion wi th SDRAM, flash memory, and \nSRAM, optionally accessing up to 516M bytes of physical memory.The memory DMA controller prov ides high bandwidth data-\nmovement capability. It can perform block transfers of code or \ndata between the internal  memory and the external\nmemory spaces.\nInternal (On-Chip) Memory\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/A DSP-BF537 processors have \nthree blocks of on-chip memory providing high-bandwidth \naccess to the core. \nThe first block is the L1 instruction memory, consisting of \n64K bytes SRAM, of which 16K bytes can be configured as a four-way set-associative cache. This memory is accessed at full \nprocessor speed.\nThe second on-chip memory block is the L1 data memory, con-\nsisting of up to two banks of up  to 32K bytes each. Each memory \nbank is configurable, offering both cache and SRAM functional-\nity. This memory block is accessed at full processor speed.\nThe third memory block is a 4K byte scratchpad SRAM, which \nruns at the same speed as the L1  memories, but is only accessible \nas data SRAM, and cannot be configured as cache memory. \nExternal (Off-Chip) Memory\nExternal memory is accessed via the EBIU. This 16-bit interface \nprovides a glueless connection to  a bank of synchronous DRAM \n(SDRAM) as well as up to four banks of asynchronous memory \ndevices including flash, EPRO M, ROM, SRAM, and memory \nmapped I/O devices.\nThe PC133-compliant SDRAM cont roller can be programmed \nto interface to up to 128M bytes of SDRAM. A separate row can \nbe open for each SDRAM internal bank, and the SDRAM con-\ntroller supports up to 4 inte rnal SDRAM banks, improving \noverall performance. \nThe asynchronous memory cont roller can be programmed to \ncontrol up to four banks of devi ces with very flexible timing \nparameters for a wide variety of devices. Each bank occupies a \n1M byte segment regardless of the size of the devices used, so \nthat these banks are only contiguo us if each is fully populated \nwith 1M byte of memory.\nI/O Memory Space\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/A DSP-BF537 processors do \nnot define a separate I/O sp ace. All resources are mapped \nthrough the flat 32-bit address space. On-chip I/O devices have their control registers mapped into memory-mapped registers \n(MMRs) at addresses near the to p of the 4G byte address space. \nThese are separated into two sma ller blocks, one which contains \nthe control MMRs for all core functions, and the other which \ncontains the registers needed fo r setup and control of the on-\nchip peripherals outside of the core. The MMRs are accessible only in supervisor mode and appear as reserved space to on-\nchip peripherals.\nBooting\nThe Blackfin processor contains a small on-chip boot kernel, which configures the appropriate peripheral for booting. If the \nBlackfin processor is configur ed to boot from boot ROM \nRev. J | Page 6 of 68 | February 2014ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537\nmemory space, the processor star ts executing from the on-chip \nboot ROM. For more information, see Booting Modes on \nPage 16 .\nEvent Handling\nThe event controller on the Blackf in processor handles all asyn-\nchronous and synchronous even ts to the processor. The \nBlackfin processor provides even t handling that supports both \nnesting and prioritization. Nesting allows multiple event service routines to be active simultaneo usly. Prioritization ensures that \nservicing of a higher priority ev ent takes precedence over servic-\ning of a lower priority event. The controller provides support for five different types of events: \n• Emulation – An emulation ev ent causes the processor to \nenter emulation mode, allowing command and control of \nthe processor via the JTAG interface.\n• Reset – This event resets the processor.• Nonmaskable Interrupt (NMI ) – The NMI event can be \ngenerated by the software watchdog timer or by the NMI \ninput signal to the processor.  The NMI event is frequently \nused as a power-down indicator to initiate an orderly shut-down of the system.• Exceptions – Events that occur synchronously to program \nflow (in other words, the exception is taken before the instruction is allowed to comp lete). Conditions such as \ndata alignment violations and undefined instructions cause \nexceptions.\n• Interrupts – Events that occur asynchronously to program \nflow. They are caused by input pins, timers, and other \nperipherals, as well as by an explicit software instruction.\nEach event type has an associated  register to hold the return \naddress and an associated return -from-event inst ruction. When \nan event is triggered, the state of the processor is saved on the \nsupervisor stack.\nThe Blackfin processor event cont roller consists of two stages: \nthe core event controller (CEC) and the system interrupt con-\ntroller (SIC). The core event co ntroller works wi th the system \ninterrupt controller to prioritize  and control all system events. \nConceptually, interrupts from the peripherals enter into the \nSIC, and are then routed directly  into the general-purpose inter-\nrupts of the CEC.

J | Page 7 of 68 | February 2014Core Event Controller (CEC)\nThe CEC supports nine general-purpose interrupts (IVG15–7), \nin addition to the dedicated interrupt and exception events. Of \nthese general-purpose interrupts, the two lowest priority \ninterrupts (IVG15–14) are recomm ended to be reserved for \nsoftware interrupt handlers, leav ing seven prioritized interrupt \ninputs to support the peripheral s of the Blackfin processor. \nTable 2  describes the inputs to the CEC, identifies their names \nin the event vector table (EVT), and lists their priorities.\nSystem Interrupt Controller (SIC)\nThe system interrupt controller provides the mapping and rout-ing of events from the many peri pheral interrupt sources to the \nprioritized general-purpose interrupt inputs of the CEC. \nAlthough the processor provides  a default mapping, the user \ncan alter the mappings and prioriti es of interrupt events by writ-\ning the appropriate values into the interrupt assignment \nregisters (IAR).

J | Page 8 of 68 | February 2014ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537\nEvent Control\nThe Blackfin processor provides a very flexible mechanism to \ncontrol the processing of events. In the CEC, three registers are \nused to coordinate and control events. Each register is \n32 bits wide:\n• CEC interrupt latch register  (ILAT) – Indicates when \nevents have been latched. Th e appropriate bit is set when \nthe processor has latched the event and cleared when the \nevent has been accepted into the system. This register is \nupdated automatically by the controller, but it can be writ-\nten only when its corresponding IMASK bit is cleared.\n• CEC interrupt mask regist er (IMASK) – Controls the \nmasking and unmasking of indivi dual events. When a bit is \nset in the IMASK register, that  event is unmasked and is \nprocessed by the CEC when a sserted. A cleared bit in the \nIMASK register masks the event, preventing the processor from servicing the event even  though the event may be \nlatched in the ILAT register. Th is register can be read or \nwritten while in supervisor mode. (Note that general-pur-pose interrupts can be globa lly enabled and disabled with \nthe STI and CLI instructions, respectively.)\n• CEC interrupt pending regi ster (IPEND) – The IPEND \nregister keeps track of all nested events. A set bit in the IPEND register indicates the event is currently active or \nnested at some level. This re gister is updated automatically \nby the controller but can be re ad while in supervisor mode. \nThe SIC allows further control of  event processing by providing \nthree 32-bit interrupt control and status registers. Each register \ncontains a bit corresponding to each of the peripheral interrupt \nevents shown in Table 3 on Page 7 .\n• SIC interrupt mask register  (SIC_IMASK) – Controls the \nmasking and unmasking of each peripheral interrupt event. \nWhen a bit is set in the regist er, that peripheral event is \nunmasked and is processed by the system when asserted. A \ncleared bit in the register masks the peripheral event, pre-\nventing the processor from servicing the event. \n• SIC interrupt status regist er (SIC_ISR) – As multiple \nperipherals can be ma pped to a single event, this register \nallows the software to dete rmine which peripheral event \nsource triggered the interrupt. A set bit indicates the \nperipheral is asserting the interrupt, and a cleared bit indi-cates the peripheral is not asserting the event.• SIC interrupt wake-up enable register (SIC_IWR) – By \nenabling the corresponding bit in  this register, a peripheral \ncan be configured to wake up  the processor, should the \ncore be idled when the event is generated. ( For more infor-\nmation, see Dynamic Power Management on Page 13. )\nBecause multiple interrupt source s can map to a single general-\npurpose interrupt, multiple puls e assertions can occur simulta-\nneously, before or during interrupt processing for an interrupt \nevent already detected on this interrupt input. The IPEND reg-\nister contents are monitored by the SIC as the interrupt acknowledgement.\nThe appropriate ILAT register bit is set when an interrupt rising \nedge is detected (detection requires two core clock cycles). The \nbit is cleared when the respective IPEND register bit is set. The IPEND bit indicates that the event has entered into the proces-\nsor pipeline. At this point the CEC recognizes and queues the \nnext rising edge event on the corresponding event input. The \nminimum latency from the rising edge transition of the general-\npurpose interrupt to the IPEND output asserted is three core \nclock cycles; however, the latenc y can be much higher, depend-\ning on the activity within and the state of the processor. \nDMA CONTROLLERS\nThe Blackfin processors have multiple, independent DMA channels that support automated data transfers with minimal \noverhead for the processor co re. DMA transfers can occur \nbetween the processor’s internal  memories and any of its DMA-\ncapable peripherals. Additionally, DMA transfers can be accom-\nplished between any of the DMA-capable peripherals and \nexternal devices connected to th e external memory interfaces, \nincluding the SDRAM controller and the asynchronous mem-\nory controller. DMA-capable peri pherals include the Ethernet \nMAC (ADSP-BF536 and ADSP-BF537 only), SPORTs, SPI port, UARTs, and PPI. Each individual  DMA-capable peripheral has \nat least one dedicated DMA channel.\nThe DMA controller supports both one-dimensional (1-D) and \ntwo-dimensional (2-D) DMA tran sfers. DMA transfer initial-\nization can be implemented from  registers or from sets of \nparameters called descriptor blocks.\nThe 2-D DMA capability support s arbitrary row and column \nsizes up to 64K elements by 64K elements, and arbitrary row \nand column step sizes up to ± 32K elements. Furthermore, the \ncolumn step size can be less th an the row step size, allowing \nimplementation of interleaved da ta streams. This feature is \nespecially useful in video appl ications where data can be de-\ninterleaved on the fly.\nExamples of DMA types suppo rted by the DMA controller \ninclude\n• A single, linear buffer that stops upon completion• A circular, auto-refreshing buffer that interrupts on each \nfull or fractionally full buffer\n• 1-D or 2-D DMA using a li nked list of descriptors\n• 2-D DMA using an array of descriptors, specifying only the \nbase DMA address with in a common page.DMA Channels 12 and 13 \n(Memory DMA Stream 0)IVG13 29\nDMA Channels 14 and 15\n(Memory DMA Stream 1)IVG13 30\nSoftware Watchdog Timer IVG13 31\nPort F Interrupt B IVG13 31Table 3.

J | Page 9 of 68 | February 2014In addition to the dedicated peripheral DMA channels, there are \ntwo memory DMA channels provid ed for transfers between the \nvarious memories of the proce ssor system. This  enables trans-\nfers of blocks of data betwee n any of the memories—including \nexternal SDRAM, ROM, SRAM, and flash memory—with mini-\nmal processor intervention. Me mory DMA transfers can be \ncontrolled by a very flexible descriptor-based methodology or \nby a standard register-based autobuffer mechanism.\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors also \nhave an external DMA controller capability via dual external DMA request pins when used in conjunction with the external \nbus interface unit (EBIU). This fu nctionality can be used when a \nhigh speed interface is required  for external FIFOs and high \nbandwidth communications periph erals such as USB 2.0. It \nallows control of the number of data transfers for memDMA. \nThe number of transfers per edge  is programmable. This feature \ncan be programmed to allow memDMA to have an increased \npriority on the external bus relative to the core.\nREAL-TIME CLOCK\nThe real-time clock (RTC) provides a robust set of digital watch \nfeatures, including current time, stopwatch, and alarm. The \nRTC is clocked by a 32.768 kH z crystal external to the \nprocessor. The RTC peripheral has dedicated power supply pins \nso that it can remain powered up and clocked even when the \nrest of the processor is in a lo w power state. The RTC provides \nseveral programmable interrupt options, including interrupt \nper second, minute, hour, or day clock ticks, interrupt on pro-\ngrammable stopwatch countdown, or interrupt at a programmed alarm time.\nThe 32.768 kHz input clock frequency is divided down to a 1 Hz \nsignal by a prescaler. The counter function of the timer consists \nof four counters: a 60-second co unter, a 60-minute counter, a \n24-hour counter, and an 32,768-day counter.\nWhen enabled, the alarm function generates an interrupt when \nthe output of the timer matches the programmed value in the \nalarm control register. There are two alarms: The first alarm is \nfor a time of day, while the second alarm is for a day and time of \nthat day.\nThe stopwatch function counts down from a programmed \nvalue, with one-second resolu tion. When the stopwatch is \nenabled and the counter underflows, an interrupt is generated.\nLike the other peripherals, the RTC can wake up the processor \nfrom sleep mode upon generati on of any RTC wake-up event. \nAdditionally, an RTC wake-up event can wake up the processor from deep sleep mode, and wake up the on-chip internal voltage \nregulator from the hibernate operating mode.\nConnect RTC pins RTXI and RTXO  with external components \nas shown in Figure 4 .\nWATCHDOG TIMER\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537 processors \ninclude a 32-bit timer that can be used to implement a software \nwatchdog function. A software watchdog can improve system availability by forcing the proc essor to a known state through \ngeneration of a system reset, nonmaskable interrupt (NMI), or general-purpose interrupt, if the timer expires before being reset \nby software. The programmer initializes the count value of the \ntimer, enables the appropriate interrupt, then enables the timer. \nThereafter, the software must reload the counter before it \ncounts to zero from the progra mmed value. This protects the \nsystem from remaining in an unknown state where software, \nwhich would normally reset the timer, has stopped running due \nto an external noise condition or software error.\nIf configured to generate a hard ware reset, the watchdog timer \nresets both the core and the proc essor peripherals.  After a reset, \nsoftware can determine if the wa tchdog was the source of the \nhardware reset by interrogating a status bit in the watchdog \ntimer control register.\nThe timer is clocked by the syst em clock (SCLK), at a maximum \nfrequency of f\nSCLK. \nTIMERS\nThere are nine general-purpose programmable timer units in \nthe processor. Eight timers have an external pin that can be con-figured either as a pulse-width modulator (PWM) or timer \noutput, as an input to clock the timer, or as a mechanism for \nmeasuring pulse widths and peri ods of external events. These \ntimers can be synchronized to an  external clock input to the sev-\neral other associated PF pins, to an external clock input to the \nPPI_CLK input pin, or to the internal SCLK.\nThe timer units can be used in conjunction with the two UARTs \nand the CAN controller to measur e the width of the pulses in \nthe data stream to provide a soft ware auto-baud detect function \nfor the respective serial channels. \nThe timers can generate interrupt s to the processor core provid-\ning periodic events for synchronization, either to the system \nclock or to a count of external signals.\nIn addition to the eight genera l-purpose progra mmable timers, \na ninth timer is also provided. Th is extra timer is clocked by the \ninternal processor clock and is ty pically used as a system tick \nclock for generating periodic in terrupts in an operating system.Figure 4.

The SPORTs support the following features:\n•I2S capable operation.\n• Bidirectional operation – Each SPORT has two sets of inde-\npendent transmit and receive pi ns, enabling eight channels \nof I2S stereo audio.\n• Buffered (8-deep) transmit an d receive ports – Each port \nhas a data register for transfe rring data words to and from \nother processor components and shift registers for shifting \ndata in and out of the data registers.\n• Clocking – Each transmit and re ceive port can either use an \nexternal serial clock or generate its own, in frequencies \nranging from (f SCLK/131,070) Hz to (f SCLK/2) Hz.\n• Word length – Each SPORT supports serial data words \nfrom 3 bits to 32 bits in leng th, transferred mo st significant \nbit first or least significant bit first.\n• Framing – Each transmit and receive port can run with or \nwithout frame sync signals for each data word. Frame sync \nsignals can be generated internally or externally, active high \nor low, and with either of two pulse widths and early or late frame sync.\n• Companding in hardware – Each SPORT can perform \nA-law or μ-law companding according to ITU recommen-\ndation G.711. Companding can be  selected on the transmit \nand/or receive channel of the SPORT without additional \nlatencies.\n• DMA operations with single-cycle overhead – Each SPORT \ncan automatically receive and tr ansmit multiple buffers of \nmemory data. The processor can link or chain sequences of \nDMA transfers between a SPORT and memory.\n• Interrupts – Each transmit a nd receive port generates an \ninterrupt upon completing the transfer of a data word or \nafter transferring an entire data buffer, or buffers, \nthrough DMA.\n• Multichannel capability – Each SPORT supports 128 chan-\nnels out of a 1024-channel wind ow and is compatible with \nthe H.100, H.110, MVIP-90, and HMVIP standards. \nSERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE (SPI) PORT\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors have \nan SPI-compatible port that en ables the processor to communi-\ncate with multiple SPI-compatible devices. \nThe SPI interface uses three pins for transferring data: two data \npins (Master Output-Slave Input, MOSI, and Master Input-\nSlave Output, MISO) and a clock pin (serial clock, SCK). An SPI chip select input pin (SPISS\n) lets other SPI devices select the \nprocessor, and seven SPI chip select output pins (SPISEL7–1 ) let \nthe processor select other SPI de vices. The SPI select pins are \nreconfigured programmable flag pins. Using these pins, the SPI port provides a full-duplex, sync hronous serial interface, which \nsupports both master/slave  modes and multimaster \nenvironments. \nThe SPI port’s baud rate and clock phase/polarities are pro-\ngrammable, and it has an integrated DMA controller, \nconfigurable to support transmit  or receive data streams. The \nSPI’s DMA controller can only serv ice unidirectional accesses at \nany given time.\nThe SPI port’s clock rate is calculated as:\nwhere the 16-bit SPI_BAUD regi ster contains a value of 2 \nto 65,535.\nDuring transfers, the SPI port  simultaneously transmits and \nreceives by serially shifting data in and out on its two serial data \nlines. The serial clock line sy nchronizes the shifting and sam-\npling of data on the two serial data lines.\nUART PORTS\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/A DSP-BF537 processors pro-\nvide two full-duplex universal asynchronous receiver and \ntransmitter (UART) ports, which are fully compatible with PC-\nstandard UARTs. Each UART port provides a simplified UART interface to other peripherals or  hosts, supporting full-duplex, \nDMA-supported, asynchronous tr ansfers of serial data. A \nUART port includes support for five to eight data bits, one or \ntwo stop bits, and none, even, or  odd parity. Each UART port \nsupports two modes of operation:\n• PIO (programmed I/O) – The processor sends or receives \ndata by writing or reading I/O mapped UART registers. The data is double-buffered on both transmit and receive.\n• DMA (direct memory access)  – The DMA controller trans-\nfers both transmit and receive data. This reduces the \nnumber and frequency of interrupts required to transfer data to and from memory. The UART has two dedicated \nDMA channels, one for transmit  and one for receive. These \nDMA channels have lower defa ult priority than most DMA \nchannels because of their re latively low service rates.\nEach UART port’s baud rate, seri al data format, error code gen-\neration and status, and interrupts are programmable:\n• Supporting bit rates ranging from (f\nSCLK/1,048,576) to \n(fSCLK/16) bits per second.\n• Supporting data formats from 7 bits to 12 bits per frame.• Both transmit and receive operations can be configured to \ngenerate maskable interrupts to the processor.\nThe UART port’s clock rate is calculated as:\nwhere the 16-bit UARTx_Divisor  comes from the UARTx_DLH \nregister (most significant 8 bits ) and UARTx_DLL register (least \nsignificant 8 bits).SPI Clock RatefSCLK\n2SPI_BAUD\uf0b4----------------------------------- - =\nUART Clock RatefSCLK\n16 UARTx_Divisor\uf0b4--------------------------------------------------=\nADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537\nRev. J | Page 11 of 68 | February 2014In conjunction with the general-purpose timer functions, auto-\nbaud detection is supported. \nThe capabilities of the UARTs are further extended with sup-\nport for the infrared data association (IrDA®) serial infrared \nphysical layer link specification (SIR) protocol. \nCONTROLLER AREA NETWORK (CAN) \nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors offer \na CAN controller that is a communication controller imple-menting the CAN 2.0B (active) protocol. This protocol is an \nasynchronous communications protocol used in both industrial \nand automotive control systems. The CAN protocol is well-suited for control applications du e to its capability to communi-\ncate reliably over a network, since the protocol incorporates \nCRC checking message error tracking, and fault node confinement.\nThe CAN controller offers the following features:\n• 32 mailboxes (eight receive only, eight transmit only, 16 \nconfigurable for receive or transmit).\n• Dedicated acceptance masks for each mailbox.• Additional data filtering on first two bytes.• Support for both the standard (11-bit) and extended \n(29-bit) identifier (ID) message formats.\n• Support for remote frames.• Active or passive network support.• CAN wake-up from hibernation mode (lowest static power \nconsumption mode).\n• Interrupts, including: Tx complete, Rx complete, error, \nglobal.\nThe electrical characteristics of  each network connection are \nvery demanding so the CAN interface is typically divided into \ntwo parts: a controller and a tran sceiver. This allows a single \ncontroller to support different drivers and CAN networks. The CAN module represents only the co ntroller part of the interface. \nThe controller interface supports connection to 3.3 V high-\nspeed, fault-tolerant, single-wire transceivers.\nTWI CONTROLLER INTERFACE \nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537 processors \ninclude a 2-wire interface (TWI) module for providing a simple \nexchange method of control data between multiple devices. The TWI is compatible with  the widely used I\n2C® bus standard. The \nTWI module offers the capabiliti es of simultaneous master and \nslave operation, support for both 7-bit addressing and multime-dia data arbitration. The TWI interface utilizes two pins for \ntransferring clock (SCL) and data (SDA) and supports the \nprotocol at speeds up to 400 kbps. The TWI interface pins are \ncompatible with 5 V logic levels.\nAdditionally, the processor’s TW I module is fully compatible \nwith serial camera control bus (SCCB) functionality for easier \ncontrol of various CMOS camera sensor devices.10/100 ETHERNET MAC \nThe ADSP-BF536 and ADSP-BF537 processors offer the capa-\nbility to directly connect to a network by way of an embedded \nfast Ethernet Media Access Co ntroller (MAC) that supports \nboth 10-BaseT (10 Mbps) and 100-BaseT (100 Mbps) operation. \nThe 10/100 Ethernet MAC peripheral is fully compliant to the \nIEEE 802.3-2002 standard, and it provides programmable fea-\ntures designed to minimize supe rvision, bus use, or message \nprocessing by the rest of the processor system.\nSome standard features are\n• Support of MII and RMII protocols for external PHYs.• Full duplex and half duplex modes.• Data framing and encapsulation: generation and detection \nof preamble, length  padding, and FCS.\n• Media access management (in half-duplex operation): col-\nlision and contention handling, including control of \nretransmission of collision fr ames and of back-off timing.\n• Flow control (in full-duplex operation): generation and \ndetection of PAUSE frames.\n• Station management: generation of MDC/MDIO frames \nfor read-write access to PHY registers.\n• SCLK operating range down to 25 MHz (active and sleep \noperating modes).\n• Internal loopback from Tx to Rx.\nSome advanced features are\n• Buffered crystal output to external PHY for support of a \nsingle crystal system.\n• Automatic checksum computat ion of IP header and IP \npayload fields of Rx frames.\n• Independent 32-bit descriptor-driven Rx and Tx DMA \nchannels.\n• Frame status delivery to memory via DMA, including \nframe completion semaphores , for efficient buffer queue \nmanagement in software.\n• Tx DMA support for separate descriptors for MAC header \nand payload to eliminate buffer copy operations.\n• Convenient frame alignment modes support even 32-bit \nalignment of encapsulated Rx or Tx IP packet data in mem-\nory after the 14-byte MAC header.\n• Programmable Ethernet event interrupt supports any com-\nbination of\n• Any selected Rx or Tx frame status conditions.\n• PHY interrupt condition.• Wake-up frame detected.• Any selected MAC management counter(s) at \nhalf-full.\n• DMA descriptor error.\n• 47 MAC management statistics  counters with selectable \nclear-on-read behavior and pr ogrammable interrupts on \nhalf maximum value.\nRev. J | Page 12 of 68 | February 2014ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537\n• Programmable Rx address fi lters, including a 64-bit \naddress hash table for multicast and/or unicast frames, and \nprogrammable filter modes fo r broadcast, multicast, uni-\ncast, control, and damaged frames.\n• Advanced power management  supporting unattended \ntransfer of Rx and Tx frames  and status to/from external \nmemory via DMA during low power sleep mode.\n• System wake-up from sleep operating mode upon magic \npacket or any of four user-definable wake-up frame filters.\n• Support for 802.3Q tagged VLAN frames.•P r o g r a m m a b l e  M D C  c l o c k  r a t e  and preamble suppression.\n• In RMII operation, 7 unused pins can be configured as \nGPIO pins for other purposes.\nPORTS \nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ ADSP-BF537 processors \ngroup the many peripheral signals to four ports—Port F, Port G, \nPort H, and Port J. Most of th e associated pins are shared by \nmultiple signals. The ports func tion as multiplexer controls. \nEight of the pins (Port F7–0) offer high source/high sink current \ncapabilities.\nGeneral-Purpose I/O (GPIO)\nThe processors have 48 bidirectional, general-purpose I/O \n(GPIO) pins allocated across three separate GPIO modules—\nPORTFIO, PORTGIO, and PORTHIO,  associated with Port F, \nPort G, and Port H, respectively. Port J does not provide GPIO \nfunctionality. Each GPIO-capable pin shares functionality with other processor peripherals via a multiplexing scheme; however, \nthe GPIO functionality is the default state of the device upon \npower-up. Neither GPIO output or  input drivers are active by \ndefault. Each general-purpose port pin can be individually con-\ntrolled by manipulation of the po rt control, status, and interrupt \nregisters:\n• GPIO direction control register  – Specifies the direction of \neach individual GPIO pin as input or output.\n• GPIO control and status registers – The processors employ \na “write one to modify” mechanism that allows any combi-\nnation of individual GPIO pins to be modified in a single instruction, without affecting the level of any other GPIO \npins. Four control registers ar e provided. One register is \nwritten in order to set pin values, one register is written in order to clear pin values, one register is written in order to \ntoggle pin values, and one register is written in order to \nspecify a pin value. Reading the GPIO status register allows \nsoftware to interrogate the sense of the pins.\n• GPIO interrupt mask register s – The two GPIO interrupt \nmask registers allow each indi vidual GPIO pin to function \nas an interrupt to the processor. Similar to the two GPIO control registers that are used  to set and clear individual \npin values, one GPIO interrupt mask register sets bits to \nenable interrupt function, and the other GPIO interrupt mask register clears bits to disable interrupt function. GPIO pins defined as inputs can be configured to generate \nhardware interrupts, while output pins can be triggered by \nsoftware interrupts.\n• GPIO interrupt sensitivity registers – The two GPIO inter-\nrupt sensitivity registers specif y whether individual pins are \nlevel- or edge-sensitive and specify—if edge-sensitive—\nwhether just the rising edge or both the rising and falling edges of the signal are signific ant. One register selects the \ntype of sensitivity, and one re gister selects which edges are \nsignificant for edge-sensitivity.\nPARALLEL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE (PPI)\nThe processor provides a parallel peripheral interface (PPI) that \ncan connect directly to parallel ADC and DAC converters, video \nencoders and decoders, and othe r general-purpose peripherals. \nThe PPI consists of a dedicated input clock pin, up to three \nframe synchronization pins, and up to 16 data pins. The input \nclock supports parallel data rates up  to half the system clock rate \nand the synchronization signals can be configured as either \ninputs or outputs.\nThe PPI supports a variety of general-purpose and ITU-R 656 \nmodes of operation. In general-purpose mode, the PPI provides \nhalf-duplex, bidirectional data transfer with up to 16 bits of \ndata. Up to three frame synchr onization signals are also pro-\nvided. In ITU-R 656 mode, th e PPI provides half-duplex \nbidirectional transfer of 8- or 10-bit video data. Additionally, \non-chip decode of embedded start-of-line (SOL) and start-of-field (SOF) preamble packets is supported.\nGeneral-Purpose Mo de Descriptions\nThe general-purpose modes of the PPI are intended to suit a \nwide variety of data capture and transmission applications. \nThree distinct subm odes are supported:\n1. Input mode – Frame syncs and data are inputs into the PPI.2. Frame capture mode – Frame syncs are outputs from the \nPPI, but data are inputs.\n3. Output mode – Frame syncs and data are outputs from the \nPPI.\nInput Mode\nInput mode is intended for ADC applications, as well as video \ncommunication with hardware sign aling. In its simplest form, \nPPI_FS1 is an external frame sync input that controls when to read data. The PPI_DELAY MMR allows for a delay (in PPI_\nCLK cycles) between reception of this frame sync and the initia-\ntion of data reads. The number of input data samples is user \nprogrammable and defined by the contents of the PPI_COUNT \nregister. The PPI supports 8-bit and 10-bit through 16-bit data, \nprogrammable in the PPI_CONTROL register.\nFrame Capture Mode\nFrame capture mode allows the video source(s) to act as a slave \n(for frame capture for example). The ADSP-BF534/\nADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537 processo rs control when to read \nfrom the video source(s). PPI_FS1 is an HSYNC output and PPI_FS2 is a VSYNC output.\nADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537\nRev. J | Page 13 of 68 | February 2014Output Mode\nOutput mode is used for transmitting video or other data with \nup to three output frame syncs. Typically, a single  frame sync is \nappropriate for data converter applications, whereas two or \nthree frame syncs could be used  for sending video with hard-\nware signaling.\nITU-R 656 Mode Descriptions\nThe ITU-R 656 modes of the PPI ar e intended to suit a wide \nvariety of video capture, proce ssing, and transmission applica-\ntions. Three distinct submodes are supported:\n1. Active video only mode2. Vertical blanking only mode3. Entire field mode\nActive Video Mode\nActive video only mode is used when only the active video por-\ntion of a field is of interest and not any of the blanking intervals. \nThe PPI does not read in any da ta between the end of active \nvideo (EAV) and start of active video (SAV) preamble symbols, or any data present during the vert ical blanking intervals. In this \nmode, the control byte sequence s are not stored to memory; \nthey are filtered by the PPI. Afte r synchronizing to the start of \nField 1, the PPI ignores incoming  samples until it sees an SAV \ncode. The user specifies the number of active video lines per frame (in PPI_COUNT register).\nVertical Blanking Interval Mode\nIn this mode, the PPI only transf ers vertical blanking interval \n(VBI) data.\nEntire Field Mode\nIn this mode, the entire incoming  bit stream is read in through \nthe PPI. This includes active video, control preamble sequences, and ancillary data that may be embedded in horizontal and ver-\ntical blanking intervals. Data transfer starts immediately after \nsynchronization to Field 1. Data is transferred to or from the synchronous channels through eight DMA engines that work \nautonomously from the processor core.\nDYNAMIC POWER MANAGEMENT\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors pro-\nvide five operating modes, each with a different performance \nand power profile. In addition, dynamic power management \nprovides the control functions to dynamically alter the proces-sor core supply voltage, furt her reducing power dissipation. \nControl of clocking to each of  the peripherals also reduces \npower consumption. See Table 4  for a summary of the power \nsettings for each mode. Also, see Table 16 , Table 15  and \nTable 17 .\nFull-On Operating Mode—Maximum Performance\nIn the full-on mode, the PLL is enabled and is not bypassed, \nproviding capability for maximum operational frequency. This \nis the power-up default execut ion state in which maximum per-\nformance can be achieved. The processor core and all enabled \nperipherals run at full speed.Active Operating Mode—Moderate Dynamic Power \nSavings\nIn the active mode, the PLL is enabled but bypassed. Because the \nPLL is bypassed, the processor’s core clock (CCLK) and system \nclock (SCLK) run at the input clock (CLKIN) frequency. In this \nmode, the CLKIN to CCLK multiplier ratio can be changed, although the changes are not real ized until the full-on mode is \nentered. DMA access is available to appropriately configured \nL1 memories.\nIn the active mode, it is possibl e to disable the PLL through the \nPLL control register (PLL_CTL). If disabled, the PLL must be \nre-enabled before transitioning to the full-on or sleep modes.\nSleep Operating Mode—High Dynamic Power Savings\nThe sleep mode reduces dynamic power dissipation  by disabling \nthe clock to the processor core  (CCLK). The PLL and system \nclock (SCLK), however, continue to operate in this mode. Typi-cally an external event or RTC ac tivity wakes up the processor. \nWhen in the sleep mode, assertin g wake-up causes the processor \nto sense the value of the BYPASS bit in the PLL control register (PLL_CTL). If BYPASS is disabled , the processor transitions to \nthe full on mode. If BYPASS is enabled, the processor transi-\ntions to the active mode. \nSystem DMA access to L1 me mory is not supported in \nsleep mode. \nDeep Sleep Operating Mode—Maximum Dynamic Power \nSavings\nThe deep sleep mode maximizes dynamic power savings by dis-\nabling the clocks to the proc essor core (CCLK) and to all \nsynchronous peripherals (SCLK) . Asynchronous peripherals, \nsuch as the RTC, may still be ru nning but cannot access internal \nresources or external memory. This powered-down mode can \nonly be exited by assertion of the reset interrupt (RESET ) or by \nan asynchronous interrupt generated by the RTC. When in deep \nsleep mode, an RTC asynchro nous interrupt causes the \nprocessor to transition to the active mode. Assertion of RESET  \nwhile in deep sleep mode causes the processor to transition to \nthe full-on mode.Table 4.

J | Page 14 of 68 | February 2014ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537\nHibernate State—Maximum Static Power Savings\nThe hibernate state maximizes stat ic power savings by disabling \nthe voltage and clocks to the processor core (CCLK) and to all of \nthe synchronous peripherals (SCLK). The internal voltage regu-\nlator for the processor can be shut off by writing b#00 to the FREQ bits of the VR_CTL regi ster. This disables both CCLK \nand SCLK. Furthermore, it sets the internal power supply volt-\nage (V\nDDINT ) to 0 V to provide the greatest power savings. To \npreserve the processor state, prio r to removing power, any criti-\ncal information stored interna lly (memory contents, register \ncontents, etc.) must be written to a nonvolatile storage device.\nSince V DDEXT  is still supplied in this st ate, all of the external pins \nthree-state, unless otherwise specif ied. This allows other devices \nthat are connected to the processor to still have power applied \nwithout drawing unwanted current.\nThe Ethernet or CAN modules can wake up the internal supply \nregulator. If the PH6 pin does not connect as the PHYINT  sig-\nnal to an external PHY device, it  can be pulled low by any other \ndevice to wake the processor up. The regulator can also be \nwoken up by a real-time clock wake-up event or by asserting the \nRESET  pin. All hibernate wake-up events initiate the hardware \nreset sequence. Individual sour ces are enabled by the VR_CTL \nregister.\nWith the exception of the VR_C TL and the RTC registers, all \ninternal registers and memories lose their content in the hiber-nate state. State variables can be held in external SRAM or \nSDRAM. The SCKELOW bit in the VR_CTL register provides a \nmeans of waking from hibernate state without disrupting a self-\nrefreshing SDRAM, provided that there is also an external pull-\ndown on the SCKE pin.\nPower Savings\nAs shown in Table 5 , the processors support three different \npower domains which maximizes flexibility, while maintaining \ncompliance with industry standa rds and conventions. By isolat-\ning the internal logic of the processor into its own power \ndomain, separate from the RTC and other I/O, the processor \ncan take advantage of dynamic power management, without affecting the RTC or other I/O de vices. There are no sequencing \nrequirements for the various power domains.\nThe dynamic power management feature allows both the pro-\ncessor’s input voltage (V\nDDINT ) and clock frequency (f CCLK) to be \ndynamically controlled. \nThe power dissipated by a processo r is largely a function of its \nclock frequency and the square of the operating voltage. For \nexample, reducing the clock freq uency by 25% re sults in a 25% \nreduction in power dissipation, while reducing the voltage by \n25% reduces power dissipation by more than 40%. Further, these power savings are additive, in that if the clock frequency \nand supply voltage are both reduced, the power savings can be \ndramatic, as shown in the following equations.\nThe power savings factor (PSF) is calculated as:\nwhere:\nfCCLKNOM  is the nominal core clock frequency\nfCCLKRED  is the reduced core clock frequency\nVDDINTNOM  is the nominal internal supply voltage\nVDDINTRED  is the reduced internal supply voltage\ntNOM is the duration running at fCCLKNOM\ntRED is the duration running at fCCLKRED\nThe percent power savings is calculated as\nVOLTAGE REGULATION\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/A DSP-BF537 processors pro-\nvide an on-chip voltage regulato r that can generate appropriate \nVDDINT  voltage levels from the V DDEXT  supply. See Operating \nConditions on Page 23  for regulator tolerances and acceptable \nVDDEXT  ranges for specific models.   \nFigure 5  shows the typical external  components required to \ncomplete the power management system. The regulator con-trols the internal logic voltage le vels and is programmable with \nthe voltage regulator control regi ster (VR_CTL) in increments \nof 50 mV. To reduce standby power consumption, the internal voltage regulator can be programmed to remove power to the \nprocessor core while keeping I/O power supplied. While in Table 5.

J | Page 15 of 68 | February 2014hibernate state, V DDEXT  can still be applied, eliminating the need \nfor external buffers. The voltage regulator can be activated from \nthis power-down state by asserting the RESET  pin, which then \ninitiates a boot sequence. The regu lator can also be disabled and \nbypassed at the user’s discretion . For additional information on \nvoltage regulation, see Switching Regulator Design Consider-\nations for the ADSP-BF533 Blackfin Processors  (EE-228) .\nCLOCK SIGNALS\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors can \nbe clocked by an external crysta l, a sine wave input, or a buff-\nered, shaped clock derived from an external clock oscillator. \nIf an external clock is used, it should be a TTL compatible signal \nand must not be halted, changed,  or operated below the speci-\nfied frequency during normal operation. This signal is connected to the processor’s CL KIN pin. When an external \nclock is used, the XTAL pin must be left unconnected.\nAlternatively, because the processors include an on-chip oscilla-\ntor circuit, an external crysta l can be used. For fundamental \nfrequency operation, us e the circuit shown in Figure 6 . A \nparallel-resonant, fundamenta l frequency, microprocessor-\ngrade crystal is connected across the CLKIN and XTAL pins. \nThe on-chip resistance between CLKIN and the XTAL pin is in \nthe 500 k\uf057 range. Further parallel resi stors are typically not rec-\nommended. The two capa citors and the series  resistor shown in \nFigure 6  fine-tune phase and amplitude of the sine frequency. \nThe capacitor and resist or values shown in Figure 6  are typical \nvalues only. The capaci tor values are dependent upon the crystal \nmanufacturers’ load capacitance recommendations and the PCB \nphysical layout. The resistor va lue depends on the drive level \nspecified by the crystal manufactur er. The user should verify the \ncustomized values based on care ful investigations of multiple \ndevices over temperature range.\nA third-overtone crystal can be used for frequencies above \n25 MHz. The circuit is then modified to ensure crystal operation \nonly at the third overtone, by adding a tuned inductor circuit as shown in Figure 6 . A design procedure fo r third-overtone oper-\nation is discussed in detail in the application note Using Third \nOvertone Crystals wi th the ADSP-218x DSP  (EE-168) .\nThe CLKBUF pin is an output pin, and is a buffer version of the \ninput clock. This pin is particularly useful in Ethernet applica-\ntions to limit the number of required clock sources in the \nsystem. In this type of applic ation, a single 25 MHz or 50 MHz \ncrystal can be applied directly to the processors. The 25 MHz or \n50 MHz output of CLKBUF can then be connected to an exter-\nnal Ethernet MII or RMII PHY device. \nBecause of the default 10× PLL multiplier, providing a 50 MHz \nCLKIN exceeds the recommended operating conditions of the \nlower speed grades. Because of this restriction, an RMII PHY \nrequiring a 50 MHz clock input cann ot be clocked directly from \nthe CLKBUF pin for the lower spee d grades. In this case, either \nprovide a separate 50 MHz clock source, or use an RMII PHY \nwith 25 MHz clock input options. The CLKBUF output is active by default and can be disabled using the VR_CTL register for \npower savings.\nThe Blackfin core runs at a different clock rate than the on-chip \nperipherals. As shown in Figure 7 , the core clock (CCLK) and \nsystem peripheral clock (SCLK)  are derived from the input \nclock (CLKIN) signal. An on-chip PLL is capable of multiplying \nthe CLKIN signal by a programmab le 0.5× to 64× multiplication \nfactor (bounded by specified minimum and maximum VCO \nfrequencies). The default multiplier is 10×, but it can be modi-fied by a software instruction se quence in the PLL_CTL register. \nOn-the-fly CCLK and SCLK frequency changes can be effected \nby simply writing to the PLL_D IV register. Whereas the maxi-\nmum allowed CCLK and SCLK rates depend on the applied \nvoltages V\nDDINT  and V DDEXT , the VCO is always permitted to run \nup to the frequency specified by  the part’s speed grade. The \nCLKOUT pin reflects the SCLK frequency to the off-chip world. \nIt belongs to the SDRAM interface, but it functions as a refer-\nence signal in other timing spec ifications as well. While active \nby default, it can be disabled using the EBIU_SDGCTL and \nEBIU_AMGCTL registers.\nAll on-chip peripherals are clocked by the system clock (SCLK). \nThe system clock frequency is programmable by means of the \nSSEL3–0 bits of the PLL_DIV re gister. The values programmed \ninto the SSEL fields define a divide ratio between the PLL output Figure 6.

Table 6  illustrates typical system clock ratios.\nNote that the divisor ratio must be chosen to limit the system \nclock frequency to its maximum of f SCLK. The SSEL value can be \nchanged dynamically without any PLL lock latencies by writing \nthe appropriate values to the PLL divisor register (PLL_DIV).\nThe core clock (CCLK) freque ncy can also be dynamically \nchanged by means of the CSEL1–0 bits of the PLL_DIV register. \nSupported CCLK divider ratios are 1, 2, 4, and 8, as shown in \nTable 7 . This programmable core cloc k capability is useful for \nfast core frequency modifications.\nThe maximum CCLK frequency not only depends on the part’s \nspeed grade (see Ordering Guide on Page 67 ), it also depends on \nthe applied V DDINT  voltage (see Table 10 , Table 11 , and Table 12 \non Page 24  for details). The maximal system clock rate (SCLK) \ndepends on the chip package and the applied V DDEXT  voltage (see \nTable 14 on Page 24 ).\nBOOTING MODES\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/A DSP-BF537 processor has six \nmechanisms (listed in Table 8 ) for automatically  loading inter-\nnal and external memory after a reset. A seventh mode is \nprovided to execute from extern al memory, bypassing the boot \nsequence.The BMODE pins of the reset configuration register, sampled \nduring power-on resets and so ftware-initiated resets, imple-\nment the following modes:\n• Execute from 16-bit external  memory – Execution starts \nfrom address 0x2000 0000 with 16-bit packing. The boot \nROM is bypassed in this mode. All configuration settings \nare set for the slowest device possible (3-cycle hold time; 15-cycle R/W access times; 4-cycle setup).\n• Boot from 8-bit and 16-bit external flash memory – The \n8-bit or 16-bit flash boot routine located in Boot ROM \nmemory space is set up using asynchronous memory bank 0. All configuration settings are set for the slowest \ndevice possible (3-cycle hold time; 15-cycle R/W access \ntimes; 4-cycle setup). The Boot ROM evaluates the first \nbyte of the boot st ream at address 0x2000 0000. If it is 0x40, \n8-bit boot is performed. A 0x60 byte assumes a 16-bit \nmemory device and performs 8-bit DMA. A 0x20 byte also \nassumes 16-bit memory but performs 16-bit DMA.\n• Boot from serial SPI memory (EEPROM or flash) – 8-, 16-, \nor 24-bit addressable device s are supported as well as \nAT45DB041, AT45DB081, AT45DB161, AT45DB321, \nAT45DB642, and AT45DB1282 DataFlash\n® devices from \nAtmel. The SPI uses the PF10/SPI SSEL1 output pin to select a single SPI EEPROM/flash device, submits a read \ncommand and successive addre ss bytes (0x00) until a valid \n8-, 16-, or 24-bit, or Atmel ad dressable device is detected, \nand begins clocking data into the processor.\n• Boot from SPI host device – The Blackfin processor oper-\nates in SPI slave mode and is configured to receive the bytes \nof the .LDR file from an SPI host (master) agent. To hold \noff the host device from transmitting while the boot ROM \nis busy, the Blackfin processo r asserts a GPIO pin, called \nhost wait (HWAIT), to signal the host device not to send \nany more bytes until the flag is  deasserted. The flag is cho-\nsen by the user and this information is transferred to the \nBlackfin processor via bits 10:5 of the FLAG header.\n• Boot from UART – Using an autobaud handshake \nsequence, a boot-stream-forma tted program is downloaded \nby the host. The host agent selects a baud rate within the \nUART’s clocking capabilities. When performing the auto-baud, the UART expects an “@” (boot stream) character \n(8 bits data, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, no parity bit) on the RXD \npin to determine the bit rate. It then replies with an acknowledgement that is composed of 4 bytes: 0xBF, the \nvalue of UART_DLL, the valu e of UART_DLH, and 0x00. \nThe host can then download the boot stream. When the \nprocessor needs to hold off the host, it deasserts CTS. \nTherefore, the host must  monitor this signal.Table 6.

J | Page 17 of 68 | February 2014• Boot from serial TWI memo ry (EEPROM/flash) – The \nBlackfin processor operates in  master mode and selects the \nTWI slave with the un ique ID 0xA0. It submits successive \nread commands to the memory device starting at 2-byte \ninternal address 0x0000 and begi ns clocking data into the \nprocessor. The TWI memory de vice should comply with \nPhilips I2C Bus Specification version 2.1 and have the capa-\nbility to auto-increment its internal address counter such \nthat the contents of the memory device can be read sequentially.\n• Boot from TWI host – The TWI host agent selects the slave \nwith the unique ID 0x5F. Th e processor replies with an \nacknowledgement and the host  can then download the \nboot stream. The TWI host agent should comply with \nPhilips I\n2C Bus Specification version 2.1. An I2C multi-\nplexer can be used to select one processor at a time when \nbooting multiple processors from a single TWI.\nFor each of the boot modes, a 10- byte header is first brought in \nfrom an external device. The he ader specifies the number of \nbytes to be transferred and th e memory destination address. \nMultiple memory blocks can be loaded by any boot sequence. \nOnce all blocks are loaded, pr ogram execution commences from \nthe start of L1 instruction SRAM.\nIn addition, Bit 4 of the reset configuration register can be set by \napplication code to bypass the normal boot sequence during a \nsoftware reset. For this case, th e processor jumps directly to the \nbeginning of L1 instruction memory.\nTo augment the boot modes, a se condary software loader can be \nadded to provide additional bo oting mechanisms. This second-\nary loader could provide the capability to boot from flash, variable baud rate, and other sour ces. In all boot  modes except \nbypass, program execution star ts from on-chip L1 memory \naddress 0xFFA0 0000.\nINSTRUCTION SET DESCRIPTION\nThe Blackfin processor family a ssembly language instruction set \nemploys an algebraic syntax desi gned for ease of coding and \nreadability. The instructions have been specifically tuned to pro-vide a flexible, densely encoded instruction set that compiles to \na very small final memory size. Th e instruction set also provides \nfully featured multifunction instructions that allow the programmer to use many of the processor core resources in a \nsingle instruction. Coupled with many features more often seen \non microcontrollers, this instruction set is very efficient when compiling C and C++ source code. In addition, the architecture \nsupports both user (algorithm/app lication code) and supervisor \n(O/S kernel, device drivers, debuggers, ISRs) modes of opera-\ntion, allowing multiple levels  of access to core processor \nresources.\nThe assembly language, which takes advantage of the proces-\nsor’s unique architecture, offe rs the following advantages:\n• Seamlessly integrated DSP/MCU features are optimized for \nboth 8-bit and 16-bit operations.\n• A multi-issue load/store modified-Harvard architecture, \nwhich supports two 16-bit MAC or four 8-bit ALU + two \nload/store + two pointer updates per cycle.• All registers, I/O, and memory  are mapped into a unified \n4G byte memory space, providing a simplified program-\nming model.\n• Microcontroller features, such as arbitrary bit and bit-field \nmanipulation, insertion, and extraction; integer operations \non 8-, 16-, and 32-bit data-typ es; and separate user and \nsupervisor stack pointers.\n• Code density enhancements, which include intermixing of \n16-bit and 32-bit instru ctions (no mode switching, no code \nsegregation). Frequently used instructions are encoded\n in 16 bits.\nDEVELOPMENT TOOLS\nAnalog Devices supports its proce ssors with a complete line of \nsoftware and hardware development tools, including integrated \ndevelopment environments (which include CrossCore® Embed-\nded Studio and/or VisualDSP++®), evaluation products, \nemulators, and a wide variety of software add-ins.\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs)\nFor C/C++ software writing and editing, code generation, and \ndebug support, Analog Devices offers two IDEs. \nThe newest IDE, CrossCore Embe dded Studio, is based on the \nEclipseTM framework.

On each  JTAG DSP, Analog Devices sup-\nplies an IEEE 1149.1 JTAG Test Access Port (TAP). In-circuit \nemulation is facilitated by use of this JTAG interface. The emu-lator accesses the processor’s internal features via the \nprocessor’s TAP, allowing the de veloper to load code, set break-\npoints, and view variables, memory, and registers. The \nprocessor must be halted to se nd data and commands, but once an operation is completed by the emulator, the DSP system is set \nto run at full speed with no im pact on system timing. The emu-\nlators require the target board to  include a header that supports \nconnection of the DSP’s JT AG port to the emulator.\nFor details on target board desi gn issues including mechanical \nlayout, single processor connection s, signal buffering, signal ter-\nmination, and emulator pod logic, see the Engineer-to-Engineer Note “Analog Devices JTAG Emulation Technical Reference ” \n(EE-68) on the Analog Devices website ( www.analog.com )—use \nsite search on “EE-68.” This do cument is updated regularly to \nkeep pace with improvements to emulator support.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThe following publications that describe the ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537 processors (and related processors) can be ordered from any Analog Devices sales office or accessed \nelectronically on our website:\n•Getting Started with Blackfin Processors\n•ADSP-BF537 Blackfin Proc essor Hardware Reference\n•ADSP-BF53x/ADSP-BF56x Blackfin Processor Program-\nming Reference\n•ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537 Blackfin Proces-\nsor Anomaly List\nRELATED SIGNAL CHAINS\nA signal chain  is a series of signal-conditioning electronic com-\nponents that receive input (data acquired from sampling either \nreal-time phenomena or from stor ed data) in tandem, with the \noutput of one portion of the ch ain supplying input to the next. \nSignal chains are often used in signal processing applications to \ngather and process data or to apply system controls based on \nanalysis of real-time phenomena. For more information about this term and related topics, see the "signal chain" entry in  \nWikipedia  or the Glossary of EE Terms  on the Analog Devices \nwebsite.\nAnalog Devices eases signal proc essing system development by \nproviding signal processing comp onents that are designed to \nwork together well. A tool fo r viewing relationships between \nspecific applications and related components is available on the www.analog.com  website.\nThe Application Signal Chains page in the Circuits from the \nLab\nTM site ( http://www.analog.com/signalchains ) provides:\n• Graphical circuit block diagram presentation of signal \nchains for a variety of circuit types and applications\n• Drill down links for components  in each chain to selection \nguides and application information\n• Reference designs applying be st practice design techniques\nADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/ADSP-BF537\nRev. J | Page 19 of 68 | February 2014PIN DESCRIPTIONS\nThe ADSP-BF534/ADSP-BF536/AD SP-BF537 processors pin \ndefinitions are listed in Table 9 . In order to maintain maximum \nfunctionality and reduce package size and pin count, some pins have dual, multiplexed functions. In cases where pin function is \nreconfigurable, the default state is shown in plain text, while the \nalternate function is shown in italics. Pins shown with an aster-isk after their name (*) offer high source/high sink current \ncapabilities.\nAll pins are three-stated during and immediately after reset, \nwith the exception of the external memory interface, asynchro-nous and synchronous memory control, and the buffered XTAL \noutput pin (CLKBUF). On the external memory interface, the control and address lines are driv en high, with the exception of \nCLKOUT, which toggles at th e system clock rate. If BR\n is active \n(whether or not RESET  is asserted), the memory pins are also \nthree-stated. During hibernate,  all outputs are three-stated \nunless otherwise noted in Table 9 . \nAll I/O pins have their input buffers disabled with the exception \nof the pins noted in the data sheet that need pull-ups or pull-\ndowns if unused.\nThe SDA (serial data) and SCL (ser ial clock) pins are open drain \nand therefore require a pull-up resistor. Consult version 2.1 of \nthe I2C specification for the proper resistor value.\nTable 9.

J | Page 27 of 68 | February 2014System designers should refer to Estimating Power for the \nADSP-BF534/BF536/BF537 Blackfin Processors (EE-297) , which \nprovides detailed information for optimizing designs for lowest power. All topics discussed in this  section are described in detail \nin EE-297. Total power dissi pation has two components:\n1. Static, including leakage current2. Dynamic, due to transistor  switching characteristics\nMany operating conditions can also affect po wer dissipation, \nincluding temperature, voltage, operating frequency, and pro-cessor activity. Electrical Characteristics on Page 25  shows the current dissipation for internal circuitry (V\nDDINT ). I DDDEEPSLEEP  \nspecifies static power dissipati on as a function of voltage \n(VDDINT ) and temperature (see Table 16  or Table 15 ), and I DDINT  \nspecifies the total power specification for the listed test condi-\ntions, including the dynamic comp onent as a function of voltage \n(VDDINT ) and frequency ( Table 18 ). \nThe dynamic component is also su bject to an Activity Scaling \nFactor (ASF) which represents ap plication code running on the \nprocessor ( Table 17 ).\nTable 15.

Figure 48  shows the measurement po int for ac measurements \n(other than output enable/disable). The measurement point is \nV\nMEAS = V DDEXT /2.\nOutput Enable Time\nOutput pins are considered to be enabled when they have made \na transition from a high impedanc e state to the point when they \nstart driving. The output enable time t ENA is the interval from \nthe point when a reference signal reaches a high or low voltage \nlevel to the point when the output starts driving as shown in the \nOutput Enable/Disable diagram ( Figure 49 ). The time t ENA_MEA-\nSURED  is the interval from when th e reference signal switches to \nwhen the output voltage reaches 2.0 V (output high) or 1.0 V \n(output low). Time t TRIP is the interval from when the output \nstarts driving to when the output reaches the 1.0 V or 2.0 V trip \nvoltage. Time t ENA is calculated as shown in \nthe equation: \nIf multiple pins (such as the da ta bus) are enab led, the measure-\nment value is that of the first pin to start driving.Output Disable Time\nOutput pins are considered to be disabled when they stop driv-ing, go into a high impedance stat e, and start to decay from their \noutput high or low voltage. The time for the voltage on the bus \nto decay by \uf044V is dependent on the capacitive load, C\nL, and the \nload current, I L. This decay time can be approximated by \nthe equation:\nThe output disable time t DIS is the difference between t DIS_MEA-\nSURED  and t DECAY  as shown in Figure 49 . The time t DIS_MEASURED  is \nthe interval from when  the reference signal switches to when the \noutput voltage decays \uf044V from the measured output-high or \noutput-low voltage. The time t DECAY  is calculated with the test \nloads C L and I L, and with \uf044V equal to 0.5 V.\nExample System Hold Time Calculation\nTo determine the data output hold  time in a particular system, \nfirst calculate t DECAY  using the equation given above. Choose \uf044V \nto be the difference between the processor’s output voltage and the input threshold for the device requiring the hold time. A \ntypical \uf044V is 0.4 V. C\nL is the total bus capacitance (per data line), \nand I L is the total leakage or three- state current (per data line). \nThe hold time is t DECAY  plus the minimum disable time (for \nexample, t DSDAT  for an SDRAM write cycle).Figure 48.
