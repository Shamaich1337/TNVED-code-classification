C | Page 3  of 41 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD9648 is a monolithic, dual -channel, 1.8 V supply, 14 -bit, \n105 MSPS/125 MSPS analog -to-digital converter (ADC). It \nfeatures a high performance sample- and-hold circuit and on -\nchip voltage reference.  \nThe product uses multistage differential pipeline architecture \nwith output error correction logic to provide 14 -bit accuracy at \n125 MSPS data rates and to guarantee no missing codes over the \nfull operating temperature range.  \nThe ADC contains several features designed to maximize \nflexibility and minimize system cost, s uch as programmable \nclock and data alignment and programmable digital test pattern generation. The available digital test patterns include built -in \ndeterministic and pseudorandom patterns, along with custom user-defined test patterns entered via the serial  port interface (SPI).  A differential clock input controls all internal conversion cycles. \nAn optional duty cycle stabilizer (DCS) compensates for wide \nvariations in the clock duty cycle while maintaining excellent overall ADC performance.  \nThe digital out put data is presented in offset binary, G ray code, or \ntwos complement format. A data output clock (DCO) is provided for each ADC channel to ensure proper latch timing with receiving  \nlogic. Output logic levels of 1.8 V CMOS or LVDS are supported. \nOutput dat a can also be multiplexed onto a single output bus.  \nThe AD9648 is available in a 64 -lead RoHS compliant LFCSP \nand is specified over the industrial temperature range (−40°C to +85°C).  \n \n \n \nAD9648  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 24 of 41 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD9648 dual ADC design can be used for diversity \nreception of signals, where the ADCs  are operating identically \non the same carrier but from two separate antennae. The ADCs \ncan also be operated with independent analog inputs. The user \ncan sample any f S/2 frequency segment from dc to 200 MHz, \nusing appropriate low -pass or band -pass filterin g at the ADC \ninputs with little loss in ADC performance. Operation to 300 MHz analog input is permitted but occurs at the expense  \nof increased ADC noise and distortion.  \nIn nondiversity applications, the AD9648 can be used as a base -\nband or direct downconversion receiver, where one ADC is used for I input data and the other is used for Q input data.  \nSynchronization capability is provided to allow synchronized timing between multiple channels or mu ltiple devices.  \nProgramming and control of the AD9648 is accomplished using \na 3-bit SPI -compatible serial interface.  \nADC ARCHITECTURE  \nThe AD9648 architecture consists of a multistage, pipelined ADC . \nEach stage provides sufficient overlap to correct for flash errors in \nthe preceding stage. The quantized outputs from each stage are \ncomb ined into a final 14 -bit result in the digital correction logic. \nThe pipelined architecture permits the first stage to operate with a \nnew input sample while the remaining stages  operate with \npreceding samples. Sampling occurs on the rising edge of  \nthe clo ck. \nEach stage of the pipeline, excluding the last, consists of a low resolution flash ADC connected to a switched -capacitor DAC \nand an interstage residue amplifier (for example, a multiplying digital -to-analog converter (MDAC)). The residue amplifier \nmagn ifies the difference between the reconstructed DAC output \nand the flash input for the next stage in the pipeline. One bit of redundancy is used in each stage to facilitate digital correction of flash errors. The last stage simply consists of a flash ADC. \nThe output staging block aligns the data, corrects errors, and \npasses the data to the CMOS/LVDS output buffers. The output \nbuffers are powered from a separate (DRVDD) supply, allowing digital output noise to be separated from the analog core. During  \npower -down, the output buffers go into a high impedance state.  ANALOG INPUT CONSIDE RATIONS  \nThe analog input to the AD9648  is a differential switched -\ncapacitor circuit designed for processing differential input \nsignals. This circuit can support a wide common -mode range \nwhile maintaining excellent performance. By using an input \ncommon -mode voltage of midsupply, users can minimize \nsignal- dependent errors and achieve optimum performance.  \nS S\nCPARCSAMPLE\nCSAMPLECPAR\nVIN–x\nHS SH\nHVIN+xH\n09975-049 \nFigure 42. Switched -Capacitor Input Circuit  \nThe clock signal alternately switches the input circuit between sample -and-hold mode (see Figure 42). When the input circuit \nis switched to sample mode, the signal source must be capable of charging the sample capacitors and settling within one -half \nof a clock cycle. A small resistor in series with each input can help reduce the peak transient current injected from the output \nstage of the driving source. In addition, low Q inductors or ferrite \nbeads can be placed on each leg of the input to reduce high differential capacitance at the analog inputs and, therefore, \nachieve the maximum bandwidth of the ADC . Such use of low \nQ inductors or ferrite beads is required when driving the converter \nfront end at high IF frequencies. Either a shunt capacitor or two \nsingle -ended capacitors can be placed on the inputs to provide a \nmatching passive network. This ultimate ly creates a low -pass \nfilter at the input to limit unwanted broadband noise. See the \nAN-742 Application Note , the AN-827 Application Not e, and the \nAnalog Dialogue  article “ Transformer -Coupled Front -End for \nWideband A/D Converters ” (Volume 39, April 2005) for more \ninformation . In general, the precise values  depend on the \napplication.  \nData Sheet  AD9648  \n \nRev. C | Page 25 of 41 Input Common Mode  \nThe analog inputs of the AD9648 are not internally dc -biased. \nTherefore, in ac -coupled applications, the user must provide a \ndc bias externally. Setting the device so that VCM = AVDD /2 is \nrecommended for optimum performance, but the device can \nfunction over a wider range with reasonable performance, as \nshown in Figure  43. \nAn on -board, common -mode voltage reference is included in \nthe design and is available from the VCM pin. The VCM pin must be de coupled to ground by a 0.1 µF capacitor, as described \nin the Applications Information  section.  \n0102030405060708090100\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3SNR/SFDR (dBFS/dBc)\nINPUT COMMON-MODE VO LTAGE (V)SFDR(dBc)\nSNR(dBFS)\n09975-072 \nFigure 43.

For baseband applications, the \nAD8138, ADA4937- 2, and ADA4938 -2 differential drivers provide \nexce llent performance and a flexible interface to the ADC.  \nThe output common -mode voltage of the ADA4938- 2 is easily \nset with the VCM pin of the AD9648 (see Figure 44), and the driver can be configured in a Sallen -Key filter topology to \nprovide band limiting of the input signal.  \nAVDD VIN 76.8Ω\n120Ω0.1µF33Ω\n33Ω10pF\n200Ω200Ω\n90Ω\nADA 4938 ADCVIN–x\nVIN+x VCM\n09975-050 \nFigure 44.

Differential Transformer- Coupled Configuration  \nThe signal characteristics must be considered when selecting  \na transformer. Most RF transformers saturate at frequencies \nbelow a few megahertz (MH z). Excessive signal power can also \ncause core saturation, which leads to distortion.  \nAt input frequencies in the second Nyquist zone and above, the noise performance of most amplifiers is not adequate to achieve the true SNR performance of the  AD9648. For applications above \n~10 MHz where SNR is a key parameter, differential double balun \ncoupling is the recommended input configuration (see Figure 46). \nAn alternative to using a transformer -coupled input at frequencies  \nin the second Nyquist zone is to use the AD8352 differential driver. \nAn example is shown in Figure 47.

An internal reference buffer loads the external reference with an equivalent 7.5 kΩ load (see Figure 41). The internal buffer generates the \npositive and negative full -scale references for the ADC core. \nTherefore, the external reference must be limited to a maximum of 1.0  V. \nCLOCK INPUT CONSIDER ATIONS  \nFor optimum performance, clock the AD9648 sample clock \ninputs, CLK+ and CLK−, with a differential signal. The signal  \nis typically ac -coupled into the CLK+ and CLK− pins via a \ntransformer o r capacitors. These pins are biased internally  \n(see Figure 51) and require no external bias.  \n0.9VAVDD\n2pF 2pFCLK– CLK+\n09975-058 \nFigure 51. Equivalent Clock Input Circuit  Clock Input Options  \nThe AD9648 has a very flexible clock input structure. The clock \ninput can be a CMOS, LVDS, LVPECL, or sine wave signal. \nRegardless of the type of signal being used, clock sou rce jitter is \nof the most concern, as described in the Jitter Considerations  \nsection.  \nFigure 52 and Figure 53 show two preferred methods for clock -\ning the AD9648 (at clock rates up to 1 GHz prior to internal CLK \ndivider). A low jitter cloc k source is converted from a single -\nended signal to a differential signal using either an RF transformer or an RF balun.  \nThe RF balun configuration is recommended for clock frequencies  \nbetween 125 MHz and 1 GHz, and the RF transformer is recom -\nmended for cl ock frequencies from 10 MHz  to 200 MHz. The \nantiparallel Schottky diodes across the transformer/balun  \nsecondary limit clock excursions into the AD9648 to \napproximately 0.8 V p -p differential.  \nThis limit helps prevent the large voltage swings of the clock from feeding through to other portions of the AD9648 while \npreserving the fast rise and fall times of the signal that are critical \nto a low jitter performance.  \n0.1µF\n0.1µF0.1µF 0.1µF\nSCHOTTKY\nDIODES:\nHSMS 2822CLOCK\nINPUT\n50Ω100Ω\nCLK–CLK+\nADCMini-Circuits®\nADT1-1WT,1:1Z\nXFMR\n09975-059 \nFigure 52.

Single- Ended 1.8 V CMOS Input Clock (Up to 200 MHz)  Input Clock Divider  \nThe AD9648 contains an input clock divider with the ability  \nto divide the input clock by integer values between 1 and 8.  \nThe AD9648 clock divider can be synchronized using the \nexternal SYNC input. Bit 1 and Bit 2 of Register 0x 3A allow the \nclock divider to be resynchronized on every SYNC signal or only on the fi rst SYNC signal after the register is written. A \nvalid SYNC causes the clock divider to reset to its initial state. \nThis synchronization feature allows multiple parts to have their \nclock dividers aligned to guarantee simultaneous input sampling.  \nClock Dut y Cycle  \nTypical high speed ADCs use both clock edges to generate  a variety of internal timing signals and, as a result, may be sensitive to clock duty cycle. Commonly, a ±5% tolerance is required on the clock duty cycle to maintain dynamic performance cha racteristics.  \nThe AD9648 contains a duty cycle stabilizer (DCS) that retimes \nthe nonsampling (falling) edge, providing an internal clock \nsignal with a nominal 50% duty cycle. This allows the user  to \nprovide a wide range of clock input duty cycles without affecting \nthe performance of the  AD9648. Noise and distortion perform -\nance are nearly flat for a wide range of duty cycles with the DCS on, as shown in Figure 57.  \nJitter in the rising edge of the input is still of concern and is not \neasily reduced by the internal stabilization circuit. The duty cycle control loop does not function for clock rates less than 20 MHz, nominally. The loop has a time constant associated \nwith it that must be considered in applications in which the  \nclock rate can change dynamically. A wait time of 1.5  µs to 5 µs \nis required after a dynamic clock frequency increase or decrease before the DCS loop is relocked to the input signal.  \n09975-076404550556065707580\n35 40 45 50 55 60 65SNR (dBFS)\nPOSITIVE DUTY CYCLE (%)SNR (DCS OFF)SNR (DCS ON)\n \nFigure 57.

The degradation in SNR from the low fre -\nquency SNR (SNR LF) at a given input frequency ( fINPUT ) due to \njitter ( tJRMS) can be calculated by  \nSNR HF = −10 log[(2π × fINPUT × tJRMS)2 + 10)10/ (LFSNR−] \nIn the previous equation, the rms aperture jitter represents the \nclock input jitter specification.

SNR vs. Input Frequency and Jitter  \nThe clock input should be treated as an analog signal in cases where aperture jitter may affect the dyna mic range of the AD9648. \nTo avoid modulating the clock signal with digital noise, keep  \npower supplies for clock drivers separate from the ADC output \ndriver supplies . Low jitter, crystal -controlled  oscillators make the \nbest clock sources. If the clock is generated from another  type of \nsource (by gating, dividing, or another method), it should  be \nretimed by the original clock at the last step.  \nSee the AN-501 Application Note  and the AN-756 Application \nNote  for more information.  \nCHANNEL/CHIP SYNCHRO NIZATION  \nThe AD9648 has a SYNC input that offers the user flexible \nsynchronization options for synchronizing sample clocks  \nacross multiple ADCs. The input clock divider can be enabled  \nto synchronize on a single occurrence of the SYNC signal  or on \nevery occurrence. The SYNC input is internally synchronized  \nto the sample clock; however, to ensure there is no timing \nuncertainty between multiple parts, the SYNC input signal should \nbe externally synchronized to the input clock signal, meeting the \nsetup and hold times shown in Table 5. Drive the SYNC input \nusing a single -ended CMOS -type signal. \nPOWER DISSIPATION AND STANDBY MODE  \nAs shown in Figure 59, the analog core power dissipated by  \nthe AD9648 is proportional to its sample rate. The digital  \npower dissipation of the CMOS outputs a re determined primarily by the strength of the digital drivers and the load  on each output bit.  \nThe maximum DRVDD current (IDRVDD) can be calculated a s \nI\nDRVDD  = VDRVDD  × CLOAD × fCLK × N \nwhere N is the number of output bits (30, in the case of the \nAD9648).  \nThis maximum current occurs when every output bit switches  \non every clock cycle, that is, a full -scale square wave at the Nyquist \nfrequency of f CLK/2. In practice, the DRVDD current is es tab-\nlished by the average number of output bits switching, which  \nis determined by the sample rate and the characteristics of the \nanalog input signal.  \nReducing the capacitive load presented to the output drivers can \nminimize digital power consumption. The data in Figure 59 was \ntaken in CMOS mode using the same operating conditions as those \nused for the Power Supplies and Power Consumption specifications \nin Table 1, with a 5 pF load on each output driver.  \n406080100120140160180200220\n0102030405060708090100\n5 25 45 65 85 105 125\nPOWER (mW)SUPP LY CURRENT (µA)\nENCODE R ATE (MSPS)IAVDD\nTOTALPOWER\nIDRVDD\n09975-070 \nFigure 59.

C | Page 30 of 41 The AD9648 is placed in power -down mode either by the SPI \nport or by asserting the PDWN pin high. In this state, the ADC \ntypically dissipates less than 2 mW . During power -down, the \noutput drivers are pl aced in a high impedance state. Asserting \nthe PDWN pin low returns the AD9648 to its normal operating \nmode. Note that PDWN is referenced to the digital output driver supply (DRVDD) and should not exceed that supply \nvoltage.  \nLow power dissipation in power -down mode is achieved by \nshutting down the reference, reference buffer, biasing networks, \nand clock. Internal capacitors are discharged when entering power -\ndown mode and then must be recharged when  returning to normal \noperation. As a result, wake -up time is related to the time spent \nin power -down mode, and shorter power -down cycles result in \nproportionally shorter wake -up times.  \nWhen using the SPI port interface, the user can place the ADC \nin power -down mode or standby mode. Standby mode allows \nthe user to keep the internal reference circuitry powered when \nfaster wake -up times are required. See the Memory Map  section \nfor more details.  \nDIGITAL OUTPUTS  \nThe AD9648 output drivers can be configured to interface with \neither  1.8 V CMOS or 1.8 V  LVDS logic families. The default \noutput mode is CMOS, with each channel output on separate \nbusses as shown in Figure 2. \nIn CMOS output mode, the CMOS output drivers  are sized to \nprovide sufficient output current to drive a wide variety of logic \nfamilies. However, large drive currents tend to cause current \nglitches on the supplies and may affect converter performance.  \nApplications requiring the ADC to drive large cap acitive loads \nor large fanouts may require external buffers or latches.  \nThe CMOS o utput can also be configured for interleaved CMOS \noutput mode via the SPI port. In interleaved  CMOS mode, the \ndata for both channels is output onto a single output bus to \nreduce the total number of traces required. The timing diagram for \ninterleaved CMOS  output mode is shown in Figure 3. \nThe interleaved CMOS output mode is enabled globally onto both  \noutput channels via Bit 5  in Register 0x14. The  unused  channel  \noutput can be disabled by selecting the appropriate Device Index  \n(Bit 1 or  Bit 0) in Register 0x05, then writing a 1 to local (channel  \nspecific) output port d isable bit in Register 0x14.  \nThe output data format can be selected to be either offset binary \nor twos complement by setting the SCLK/DFS pin when operating \nin th e external pin mode (see Table 13). As detailed in  the AN-877 Application Note , Interfacing to High \nSpeed ADCs via SPI , the data format can be selected for offset \nbinary, twos complement, or gray code when using the SPI control.  \nTable 13. SCLK/DFS Mode Selection (External Pin Mode)  \nVoltage at Pin  SCLK/DFS  SDIO/DCS  \nAGND  Offset binary  (default) DCS disabled  \nDRVDD  Twos complement  DCS enabled (default)  \nDigital Output Enable Function (OEB)  \nThe AD9648 has a flexible three -state ability for the digital \noutput pins. The three -state mode is enabled through the SPI \ninterface and can subsequently be controlled using the OEB pin or through the SPI. Once enabled via SPI (Bit 7) in Register 0x101 , \nand the OEB p in is low, the output data drivers and DCOs are \nenabled. If the OEB pin is high, the output data drivers and \nDCOs are placed in a high impedance state. This OEB function \nis not intended for rapid access to the data bus. Note that OEB \nis referenced to the d igital output driver supply (DRVDD) and \nshould not exceed that supply voltage.  \nWhen using the SPI interface, the data outputs and DCO of \neach channel can be independently three -stated by using the \noutput disable  bit (Bit 4) in Register 0x14.  \nTIMING  \nThe AD9648 provides latched data with a pipeline delay of  \n16 clock cycles. Data outputs are available one propagation \ndelay (t PD) after the rising edge of the clock signal.  \nMinimize the length of the ou tput data lines and loads placed \non them to reduce transients within the AD9648. These \ntransients can degrade converter dynamic performance.  \nThe lowest typical conversion rate of the AD9648 is 10 MSPS. \nAt clock rates below 10 MSPS, dynamic performance can degrade.  \nData Clock Output (DCO)  \nThe AD9648 provides two data clock output (DCO) signals \nintended  for capturing the data in an external register. In CMOS \noutput mode, the data outputs are valid on the rising edge of DCO, \nunless the DCO clock polarity has been changed via the SPI. In \nLVDS output mode, the DCO and data output switc hing edges \nare closely aligned. Additional delay can be added to the DCO \noutput using SPI Register 0x17 to increase the data setup time. \nIn this case, the Channel A output data is valid on the rising edge of DCO, and the Channel B output data is valid on the \nfalling edge of DCO. See Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 for \na graphical timing description of the output modes.  \nTable 14.

Some of the test patterns are subject to output formatting, and some are \nnot. The PN generators from the PN sequence tests can be reset by setting Bit 4 or Bit 5 of Register 0x0D. These tests can be performed with or without an analog signal (if present, the analog  signal is ignored), but they do require an encode clock. \nFor more information, see the AN -877 Application Note , \nInterfacing to High Speed ADCs via SPI . \n \nAD9648 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 32 of 41 SERIAL PORT INTERFACE (SPI) \nThe AD9648 serial port interface (SPI) allows the user to configure \nthe converter for specific functions or operations through a \nstructured register space provided inside the ADC. The SPI  gives the user added flexibility and customization, depending on \nthe application. Addresses are accessed via the serial port and \ncan be written to or read from via the port. Memory is organized into bytes that can be further divided into fields, which are docu-mented in the Memory Map section. For detailed operational information, see the AN-877 Application Note , Interfacing to \nHigh Speed ADCs via SPI . \nCONFIGURATION USING THE SPI \nThree pins define the SPI of this ADC: the SCLK/DFS pin, the \nSDIO/DCS pin, and the CSB pin (see Table 15). The SCLK/DFS \n(a serial clock) is used to synchronize the read and write data \npresented from and to the ADC. The SDIO/DCS (serial data \ninput/output) is a dual-purpose pin that allows data to be sent to and read from the internal ADC memory map registers. The CSB (chip select bar) is an active low control that enables or \ndisables the read and write cycles. \nTable 15. Serial Port Interface Pins \nPin Function \nSCLK Serial clock. The serial shift clock input, which is used to \nsynchronize serial interface reads and writes.  \nSDIO Serial data inp ut/output. A dual-purpose pin that \ntypically serves as an input or an output, depending on the instruction being sent and the relative position in the timing frame.  \nCSB Chip select bar. An active low control that gates the read and write cycles.  \n The falling edge of the CSB, in conjunction with the rising edge \nof the SCLK, determines the start of the framing. An example of \nthe serial timing and its definitions can be found in Figure 61 \nand Table 5.  \nOther modes involving the CSB are available. The CSB can be \nheld low indefinitely, which permanently enables the device; this is called streaming. The CSB can stall high between bytes to allow for additional external timing. When CSB is tied high, SPI \nfunctions are placed in high impedance mode. This mode turns \non any SPI pin secondary functions.  \nDuring an instruction phase, a 16-bit instruction is transmitted. \nData follows the instruction phase, and its length is determined \nby the W0 and W1 bits.  \nIn addition to word length, the instruction phase determines \nwhether the serial frame is a read or write operation, allowing the serial port to be used both to program the chip and to read the contents of the on-chip memory. The first bit of the first byte in \na multibyte serial data transfer frame indicates whether a read \ncommand or a write command is issued. If the instruction is a readback operation, performing a readback causes the serial data input/output (SDIO) pin to change direction from an input to \nan output at the appropriate point in the serial frame. \nAll data is composed of 8-bit words. Data can be sent in MSB-\nfirst mode or in LSB-first mode. MSB first is the default on \npower-up and can be changed via the SPI port configuration \nregister. For more information about this and other features, see the AN-877 Application Not e, Interfacing to High Speed \nADCs via SPI . \n \nDON’T CARE\nDON’T CARE DON’T CAREDON’T CARE\nSDIOSCLKCSBtS tDHtCLKtDS tH\nR/W W1 W0 A12 A11 A10 A9 A8 A7 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0tLOWtHIGH\n09975-046 \nFigure 61. Serial Port Interface Timing Diagram \nData Sheet  AD9648  \n \nRev. C | Page 33 of 41 HARDWARE INTERFACE  \nThe pins described in Table 15 comprise the physical interface \nbetween the user programming device and the serial port of the \nAD9648. The SCLK pin and the CSB pin  function as inputs \nwhen using the SPI interface. The SDIO pin is bidirectional, \nfunctioning as an input during write phases and as an output during readback.  \nThe SPI interface is flexible enough to be controlled by either FPGAs or microcontrollers. One m ethod for SPI configuration \nis described in detail in the AN-812 Application Note , Micro -\ncontroller -Based Serial Port Interface (SPI) Boot Circuit .  \nThe SPI port should not be active during period s when the full \ndynamic performance of the converter is required. Because the SCLK signal, the CSB signal, and the SDIO signal are typically \nasynchronous to the ADC clock, noise from these signals can \ndegrade converter performance. If the on -board SPI bus is used for \nother devices, it may be necessary to provide buffers between this bus and the AD9648 to prevent these signals from transi -\ntioning at the converter inputs during critical sampling peri ods. \nSome pins serve a dual function when the SPI interface is not being used. When the pins are strapped to DRVDD or ground \nduring device power -on, they are associated with a specific \nfunction. Table 16 describes the strappable functions supported \non the  AD9648.  \nCONFIGURATION WITHOU T THE SPI  \nIn applications that do not interface to the SPI control registers, the SDIO/DCS pin, the SCLK/DFS pin, the OEB pin, and  the \nPDWN pin serve as standalone CMOS -compatible control pins. \nWhen the device is powered up, it is assumed that the user intends  \nto us e the pins as static control lines for the duty cycle stabilizer, \noutput data format, and power -down feature control.

For SPI control of output enable and \npower -down,  the OEB and PDWN pins should be set to their \ndefault states.  \nTable 16.

C | Page 34 of 41 MEMORY MAP  \nREADING THE MEMORY M AP REGISTER TABLE  \nEach row in the memory map register table has eight bit locations . \nThe memory map is roughly divided into three sections: the chip \nconfiguration registers (Address 0x00 to Address 0x02); the \nchannel index and transfer registers (Address 0x05 and  \nAddress 0xFF) and the ADC functions registers,  including setup, \ncontrol, and test (Address 0x08 to Address 0x102) . \nThe memory map register table (see Table 18) lists the default \nhexadecimal value for each hexadecimal address shown. The \ncolumn with the heading Bit 7 (MSB) is the start of the default \nhexadecimal value given. For example, Address 0x05 , the device \nindex register, has a hexadecimal  default value of 0x03. This \nmeans that in Address 0x05 Bit s[7:2] = 0, and Bits[1:0] = 1. This \nsetting is a  default channel index setting. The default value \nresults in both ADC channels receiving the next write \ncommand. For more information on this function and others, see \nthe AN-877 Application Note , Interfacing to High Speed ADCs via \nSPI. This application note details the functions controlled by \nRegis ter 0x00 to Register 0xFF. The remaining registers, are \ndocumented  in the Memory Map Register Descriptions  section.  \nOpen Locations  \nAll address and bit locations that are not included in Table 18 \nare not currently supported for this device. Unused bits of a \nvalid address location should be written with 0s. Writing to these  \nlocati ons is required only when part of an address location is \nopen (for example, Address 0x05). If the entire address location \nis open (for example, Address 0x13), this address location should not be written  to.  Default Values  \nAfter the AD9648 is reset, critical registers are loaded with \ndefault values. The default values for the registers are given in the memory map register table, Table 18. \nLogic Levels  \nAn explanation of logic level terminology follows:  \n• “Bit is set” is synonymous with “bit is set to Logic 1” or \n“writing Logic 1 for the bit. ”  \n• “Clear a bit” is synonymous with “b it is set to Logic 0” or \n“writing Logic 0 for the bit. ”  \nChannel -Specific Registers  \nSome channel setup functions can be programmed for each \nchannel individually. In these cases, channel address locations are internally duplicated for each channel. These registers and bits are designated in Table 18 as local. These local registers and \nbits can be accessed by setting the appropriate Channel A or \nChannel B bits in Register 0x05. If both bits are set, the \nsubsequent write affects the registers of both channels. In a read cycle, only Channel A or Channel B should be set to read one of the two registers. If both bits are set during an SPI read cycle, the part returns the value for Channel  A. Registers and bits \ndesignated as global in Table 18 affect the entire part or the \nchannel features for which independent settings are not allowed between channels.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD9648  \n \nRev.

Outputs are \ndisabled . \nIn standby mode (Bits[1:0] = 10), the digital data path clocks \nand the outputs are disabled.  \nDuring a digital reset (Bits[1:0] = 11), the digital data path clocks  \nare disabled while the digita l data path is held in reset. The outputs  \nare enabled in this state. For optimum performance, it is recom -\nmended that both ADC channels be reset simultaneously. This is accomplished by ensuring that both channels are selected via Register 0x05 prior to iss uing the digital reset instruction.  \nEnhancement Control (Register 0x0C)  \nBits[7:3]— Open  \nBit 2 —Chop Mode  \nFor applications that are sensitive to offset voltages and other low frequency noise, such as homodyne or direct -conversion \nreceivers, chopping in the first stage of the AD96 48 is a feature \nthat can be enabled by setting Bit 2.  In the frequency domain, \nchopping translates offsets and other low frequency noise to f\nCLK/2 where it can be filtered.  \nBits[1:0]— Open  \nOutput Mode (Register 0x14)  \nBits[7:6]— Output Port Logic Type  \n00 = CMOS, 1.8 V  \n10 = LVDS, ANSI 11 = LVDS, reduced range  \nBit 5 —Output Interleave Enable \nFor LVDS outputs, setting Bit 5 enables interleaving. Channel A \nis sent coincident with a hig h DCO clock, and Channel B is \ncoincident with a low DCO clock. Clearing Bit 5 disables the  interleaving feature. Channel A is sent on least significant bits \n(LSBs), and Channel B is sent on most significant bits (MSBs). \nThe even bits are sent coincident with a high DCO clock, and the odd bits are sent coincident with a low DCO clock.  \nFor CMOS outputs, setting Bit 5 enables interleaving in CMOS \nDDR mode. On ADC Output Port A, Channel A is sent coincident  \nwith a low DCO clock , and Channel B is coincident with a high \nDCO clock. On ADC Output Port B, Channel B is sent coincident  \nwith a low DCO clock , and Channel A is coincident with a high \nDCO clock. Clearing Bit 5 disables the interleaving feature, and \ndata is output in CMOS SD R mode. Channel A is sent to Port A, \nand Channel B is sent to Port B.  \nBit 4 —Output Port Disable  \nSetting Bit 4 high disables the output port for the channels \nselected in Bits[1:0] of the device index register (Register 0x05).  \nBit 3 —Open  \nBit 2 —Output Invert  \nSetting Bit 2 high inverts the output port data for the channels \nselected in Bits[1:0] of the device index register (Register 0x05).  \nBits[1:0] —Output Format  \n00 = offset binary  \n01 = twos complement  \n10 = Gray code  \nSync Control (Register 0x3A)  \nBits[7:3]— Open  \nBit 2 —Clock Divider Next Sync Only  \nIf the clock divider sync enable bit (Address 0x3A, Bit 1) is high, \nBit 2 allows the clock divider to sync to the first sync pulse  it \nreceives and to ignore the rest. The clock divider sync enable bit \nresets after it sync s. \nBit 1 —Clock Divider Sync Enable  \nBit 1 gates the sync pulse to the clock divider. The sync signal is \nenabled when Bit 1 is high. This is continuous sync  mode.  \nBit 0 —Open  \nTransfer (Register  0xFF)  \nAll registers except Register 0x100 are updated the moment they \nare written.  Setting Bit 0 of this transfer register high initializes \nthe settings in the ADC sample rate override register (Address 0x100).  \nSample Rate Override (Register 0x100)  \nThis register is designed to allow the user to downgrade the device.  \nAny attempt to upgrade the default speed grade results in a chip \npower -down. Settings in this register are not initialized until Bit 0 \nof the transfer register (Register 0xFF) is written high.  \nData Sheet  AD9648  \n \nRev.

If  Bit 7 is clear, the OEB pin is disabled. \nBits[6:1]— Open  \nBit 0 —SDIO Pull -Down  \nBit 0 can be set to disable the internal 30 kΩ pull -down on the \nSDIO pin, which can be used to limit the loading when many \ndevices are connected to the SPI bus.

C | Page 40 of 41 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nDESIGN GUIDELINES  \nBefore starting design and layout of the AD9648 as a system,  \nit is recommended that the designer become familiar with these \nguidelines, which discuss the special circuit connections and \nlayout requirements that are needed for certain pins.  \nPower and Ground Recommendations  \nWhen connecting power to the  AD9648, it is recommended that \ntwo separate 1.8 V supplies be used. Use one supply for analog \n(AVDD);  use a separate supply for the digital outputs (DRVDD). \nFor both AVDD and DRVDD s everal different  decoupling capa -\ncitors should be used to cover both high and low frequencies. \nPlace these capacitors close to the point of entry at the PCB level  \nand close to the pins of the part, with minimal trace length.  \nA single PCB ground plane should be sufficient when using the  \nAD9648. With proper decoupling and smart partitioning of the \nPCB analog, digital, and clock sections, optimum performance \nis easily achieved.  \nLVDS Operation  \nThe AD9648 defaults to CMOS output mode on power -up.  \nIf LVDS operation is desired, this mode must be programmed, using the SPI configuration registers after power -up. When the \nAD9648 powers up in CMOS mode with LVDS termination \nresistors (100 Ω) on the outputs, the DRVDD current can be higher than the typical value until the part is placed in LVDS mode. This additional DRVDD current does not cause damage to the AD9648 , but it should be taken into account when consid -\nering  the maximum DRVDD current for the part.  \nTo avoid this additional DRVDD current, the AD9648 outputs \ncan be disabled at power -up by taking the PDWN pin high. \nAfter the part is placed into LVDS mode via the SPI port, the PDWN pin can be taken low to enable the outputs.  \nClock Stability Considerations  \nWhen powered on, the AD9648 enters an initialization phase \nduring which an internal state machine sets up the biases and the registers for proper operation. During the initialization process, the AD9648 needs a stable clock. If the ADC clock \nsource is not present or not stable during ADC power -up, it \ndisrupts the state machine and causes the ADC to start up in an unknown state. To correct this, an initialization sequence m ust \nbe reinvoked after the ADC clock is stable b y issuing a digital \nreset via Register 0x08. In the default configuration (internal V\nREF, ac-coupled input) where V REF and V CM are supplied by the \nADC itself, a stable clock during power -up is sufficient. In the \ncase where VREF and/or V CM are supplied by an external source, \nthese, too, must be stable at power -up; otherwise, a subsequent \ndigital reset via Register 0x08 is needed. Interruption of the sample clock during operation and changes in sample rate also necessitate a d igital reset.  The pseudo code sequence for a digital reset is as follows:  \nSPI_Write (0x08, 0x03);   # Digital Reset \nSPI_Write (0x08, 0x00);   # Can be asserted \nas soon as the next SPI cycle, normal \noperation resumes after 2.9e6 sample clock \ncycles, ADC outputs 0s until the reset is \ncomplete. \nExposed Paddle Thermal Heat Slug Recommendations  \nIt is mandatory that the exposed paddle on the underside of the \nADC be connected to analog ground (AGND) to achieve the best electrical and thermal performance. A continu ous, exposed \n(no solder mask) copper plane on the PCB should mate to the AD9648 exposed paddle, Pin 0.  \nThe copper plane should have several vias to achieve the lowest possible resistive thermal path for heat dissipation to flow through \nthe bottom of the PCB. These vias should be filled or plugged to \nprevent solder wicking through the vias, which can compromise the connection.  \nTo maximize the coverage and adhesion between the ADC and the PCB, a silkscreen should be overlaid to partition the continuous  \nplane on the PCB into several uniform sections. This provides several tie points between the ADC and the PCB during the reflow process. Using one continuous plane with no partitions guarantees  \nonly one tie point between the ADC and the PCB.  For detailed \ninformation about packaging and PCB layout of chip scale \npackages, see the AN -772 Application Note , A Design and \nManufacturing Guide for the Lead Frame Chip Scale Package (LFCSP) . \nVCM  \nThe VCM pin should be decoupled to ground with a 0.1 μF \ncapacitor.  \nReference Decoupling  \nThe VREF pin should be externally decoupled to ground w ith  \na low ESR, 1.0 μF capacitor in parallel with a low ESR, 0.1 μF ceramic capacitor.  \nSPI Port  \nThe SPI port should not be active during periods when the full \ndynamic performance of the converter is required. Because the SCLK, CSB, and SDIO signals are t ypically asynchronous to the \nADC clock, noise from these signals can degrade converter performance. If the on -board SPI bus is used for other devices, \nit may be necessary to provide buffers between this bus and the AD9648 to keep these signals from transitioning at the converter \ninputs during critical sampling periods.  \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD9648\n \nRev.
