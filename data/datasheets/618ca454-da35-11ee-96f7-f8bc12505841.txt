We recommend using a latching relay (magnetic-holding relay) in this kind of circuit. If a single-side stable model must be used in this kind of circuit, we recommend using a fail-safe circuit design that provides protection against contact failure or coil burnout.\n\x81 Relay Handling\n\x81 Use the Relay as soon as possible after opening the \nmoistureproof package. If the Relay is left for a long time after opening the moisture-proof package, the appearance may suffer and seal failure may occur after the solder mounting process. To store the Relay after opening the moisture-proof package, place it into the original package and sealed the package with adhesive tape.\n\x81 When washing the product after soldering the Relay to a PCB, \nuse a water-based solvent or alcohol-based solvent, and keep the solvent temperature to less than 40°C. Do not put the Relay in a cold cleaning bath immediately after soldering.\n\x81 Claw Securing Force During Automatic Mounting\n\x81 During automatic insertion of Relays, be sure to set the \nsecuring force of each claw to the following so that the Relay’s characteristics will be maintained.150\n20 to 30220 to 240\n180 to 200Soldering\nPreheating\nTime (s)90 to 120Temperature (°C)\n(The temperature profile indicates the temperature on the circuit board \nsurface.)\n250 max.\n230\n180\n150\nTime (s)120 max. 30 max.Relay terminal\nsectionSoldering\nPreheatingUppwe surface of case \n(peak): 255°C max.Temperature (°C)\n(The temperature profile indicates the temperature on the PCB.)Insufficient amount \nof solderExcessive amount \nof solderHeel fillet \nis formed\nSolderPCBLandTerminalRelayCorrect Soldering Incorrect Soldering\nContact form Coil ratings Contact ratingsNumber of test \noperations\nDPDT (2c) 2 to 48 VDC3 A, 30 VDC at 40°C\n0.3 A, 110 VDC at 40°C\n0.5 A, 125 VAC at 40°C6,000 \nContact form Isolation category Voltage\nDPDT (2c) Supplementary Isolation 250 VACCorrect Use\nAC\nBDimension A: 1.96 N max.\nDimension B: 4.90 N max.Dimension C: 1.96 N max.\n8G6S Surface-mounting Relay\nG\n6\nS\n• Applic ation ex amples provided in thi s document are for reference only.
