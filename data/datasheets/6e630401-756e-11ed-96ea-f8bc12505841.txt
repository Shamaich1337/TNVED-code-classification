This device provides a small signal con-version gain of 16.5 dB with 30 dBc of sideband rejection. The HMC925LC5 utilizes a RF amplifier preceded by an I/Q mixer where the LO is driven by a driver amplifier. IF1 and IF2 mixer inputs are provided and an external 90° hybrid is needed to select the required sideband. The I/Q mixer topology reduces the need for filtering of the unwanted  \nsideband. The HMC925LC5 is a much smaller alternative to hybrid style single sideband upconverter assemblies and it eliminates the need for wire  \nbonding by allowing the use of surface mount man-ufacturing techniques.\nElectrical Specifications [1][2], TA = +25°C, IF = 2000 MHz,  \nLO = +0 dBm, Vdd1, 2, 3, 4 = +5V, Idd2 + Idd3 + Idd4 = 130 mA LSB [1][2], Idd1 = 114 mA \nParameter Min.
