### Component Summary: HMC187AMS8ETR

**Description:**
The HMC187AMS8ETR is a GaAs MMIC (Gallium Arsenide Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) passive frequency doubler designed for applications requiring frequency multiplication. It operates within an input frequency range of 0.85 to 2.0 GHz and is packaged in a miniature 8-lead MSOP (Mini Small Outline Package). The device is particularly noted for its low conversion loss and high isolation of unwanted harmonics.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; typically, MMICs operate at low voltages.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified; current consumption is generally low for passive devices.
- **Power Consumption:** Input drive level ranges from +10 dBm to +20 dBm.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -40°C to +85°C.
- **Package Type:** 8-lead MSOP (Mini Small Outline Package).
- **Special Features:**
  - Conversion loss: 15 dB (typical).
  - Isolation for fundamental frequency (Fo): 40 dB (typical).
  - Isolation for 3Fo: 46 dB (typical).
  - Isolation for 4Fo: 40 dB (typical).
  - Passive Schottky diode technology contributes no measurable additive phase noise.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** MSL1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E).

**Typical Applications:**
The HMC187AMS8ETR is ideal for:
- Wireless local loop systems.
- LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Service).
- VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) communications.
- Point-to-point radios.
- UNII (Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure) and HiperLAN (High Performance Local Area Network) applications.
- Test equipment for RF applications.

This component is particularly useful in high-volume applications where frequency doubling is more cost-effective than generating higher frequencies directly. Its design minimizes unwanted harmonics, making it suitable for clean signal processing in various RF communication systems.
