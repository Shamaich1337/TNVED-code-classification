It operates with an input \nvoltage range of 2.6 V to 12 V , and delivers a continuous load \ncurrent up to 500 mA. The ADP3335  stands out from conventional  \nlow dropout regulators (LDOs) by using an enhanced process enabling it to offer performance advantages beyond its competition . \nIts patented design requires only a  1.0 µF output capacitor for \nstability. This device is insensitive to output capacitor equivalent series resistance (ESR), and is stable with any good quality capacitor —including ceramic (MLCC) types for space -restricted  \napplications. The ADP3335 achieves exceptional accuracy of \n±0.9% at room temperature and ± 1.8% over temperature, line, \nand load.  The dropout voltage of the ADP3335 is only 200 mV (typical) at \n500 mA. This device also includes a safety current limit, thermal  \noverload protection, and a shutdown feature. In shutdown mode , \nthe ground current is reduced to less than 1 µA. The ADP3335 has \na low quiescent current of 80 µA (typical) in light load situations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nADP3335 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

Output Noise Density  \n \n \nData Sheet ADP3335 \n \nRev. D | Page 9  of 16 THEORY OF OPE RATION  \nThe ADP3335 uses a single control loop for regulation and \nreference functions. The output voltage is sensed by a resistive \nvoltage divider, R1 and R2, which is varied to provide the available output voltage option. Feedback is taken from this \nnetwork by way of a series diode, D1, and a second resistor \ndivider, R3 and R4, to the input of an amplifier.  \nINPUT\n00147-0-023OUTPUT\nCOMPENSATION\nCAPACITOR\nR2R1\nGNDADP3335PTAT\nCURRENTR4PTAT\nVOSgmQ1ATTENUATION\n(VBANDGAP /VOUT)\nR3D1\n(a)CLOAD\nRLOADNONINVERTING\nWIDEBAND\nDRIVER\n \nFigure 23. Functional Block Diagram  \nA very high gain error am plifier is used to control this loop. The \namplifier is constructed in such a way that equilibrium produces  a \nlarge, temperature proportional input offset voltage that is \nrepeatable and very well controlled. The temperature proportional  \noffset voltage combi nes with the complementary diode voltage \nto form a virtual band gap voltage implicit in the network, although \nit never appears explicitly in the circuit.  \nThis patented design makes it possible to control the loop with \nonly one amplifier. This technique als o improves the noise \ncharacteristics of the amplifier by providing more flexibility in \nthe trade -off of noise sources that leads to a low noise design.  \nThe R1 and R2 divider is chosen in the same ratio as the band gap  \nvoltage to the output voltage. Althoug h the R1 and R2 resistor \ndivider is loaded by the D1 diode and a second divider —R3 and R4, the values can be chosen to produce a temperature stable \noutput. This unique arrangement specifically corrects for the loading of the divider, thus avoiding the erro r resulting from \nbase current loading in conventional circuits.  \nThe patented amplifier controls a new and unique noninverting driver that drives the pass transistor, Q1. This special noninverting  \ndriver enables the frequency compensation to include the loa d \ncapacitor in a pole -splitting arrangement to achieve reduced \nsensitivity to the value, type, and ESR of the load capacitance.  \nMost LDOs place very strict requirements on the range of ESR \nvalues for the output capacitor, because they are difficult to \nstabilize due to the uncertainty of load capacitance and resistance . \nThe ESR value required to keep conventional LDOs stable, \nmoreover, changes depending on load and temperature. These \nESR limitations make designing with LDOs more difficult because of their un clear specifications and extreme variations \nover temperature.  \nWith the ADP3335, ESR limitations are no longer a source of \ndesign constraints. The ADP3335 can be used with virtually any \ngood quality capacitor and with no constraint on the minimum \nESR. This innovative design allows the circuit to be stable with \njust a small 1 µ F capacitor on the output. Additional advantages \nof the pol e-splitting scheme include superior line noise reject -\ntion and very high regulator gain, which lead to excellent line and load regulation. Impressive ±1.8% accuracy is guaranteed \nover line, load, and temperature.  \nAdditional features of the circuit include current limit, thermal shutdown, and noise reduction.  \n \n \nADP3335 Data Sheet \n \nRev. D | Page 10 of 16 APPLICATIONS  INFORMATION  \nOUTPUT CAPACITOR SEL ECTION  \nAs with any micropower device, output transient response is a \nfunction of the output capacitance. The ADP3335 is stable over \na wide range of capacitor values, types, and ESR (anyCAP). A \ncapacitor as low as 1 µ F is all that is needed for stability; larger \ncapacitors can be used if high output current surges are anticipated . \nThe ADP3335 is stable with ex tremely low ESR capacitors (ESR \n≈ 0), such as multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) or organic  \nsemiconductor electrolytic capacitors (OSCON). Note that the effective capacitance of some capacitor types may fall below the minimum at extreme temperatures. Ensure that the capacitor prov ides more than 1 µ F over the entire temperature range.  \nINPUT BYPASS CAPACIT OR  \nAn input bypass capacitor is not strictly required, but is advisable  \nin any application involving long input wires or high source impedance. Connecting a 1 µF capacitor from IN to ground \nreduces the circuit’s sensitivity to PC board layout. If a larger value output capacitor is used, then a larger value input capacitor  \nis also recommended.  \nNOISE REDUCTION  \nA noise reduction capacitor (C NR) can be used, as shown in \nFigure 24, to further reduce the noise by 6 dB to 10 dB ( Figure 22). \nLow leakage capacitors in the 100 pF to 1 nF range provide the best performance. Since the noise reduction pin, NR, is in ternally \nconnected to a high impedance node, any connection to this node  \nshould be made carefully to avoid noise pickup from external sources. The pad connected to this pin should be as small as possible, and long PC board traces are not recommended.  \nWhen adding a noise reduction capacitor, maintain a minimum \nload current of 1 mA when not in shutdown.  \nIt is important to note that as C\nNR increases, the turn -on time \nwill be delayed. With NR values greater than 1 nF, this delay \nmay be on the order of several m illiseconds.  \nNR\nIN\nINOUTOUT\nOUT\nGND SDADP3335\nON\nOFFVINCIN\n1µF+ +VOUT\n00147-0-02113\n4725\n68\nCOUT\n1µFCNR\n \nFigure 24. Typical Application Circuit  \n \n  \n THERMAL OVERLOAD PRO TECTION  \nThe ADP3335 is protected against damage from excessive \npower dissipation by its th ermal overload protection circuit, \nwhich limits the die temperature to a maximum of 165 °C. \nUnder extreme conditions (i.e., high ambient temperature and \npower dissipation) where die temperature starts to rise above \n165° C, the output current is reduced until  the die temperature \nhas dropped to a safe level. The output current is restored when \nthe die temperature is reduced.  \nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect \nthe device against accidental overload conditions. For normal \noperation, device power dissipation should be externally limited \nso that junction temperatures will not exceed 150 °C. \nCALCULATING JUNCTION  TEMPERATURE  \nDevice power dissipation is calculated as follows: \nPD = (V IN − VOUT)ILOAD + (V IN)IGND  \nWhere ILOAD and IGND are load cu rrent and ground current, and \nVIN and VOUT are input and output voltages, respectively. \nAssuming ILOAD = 400 mA, I GND = 4 mA, V IN = 5.0 V , and V OUT = \n3.3 V , device power dissipation is  \nPD = (5 V –  3.3 V)400 mA + 5.0 V(4 mA) = 700 mW  \nThe junction temperatur e can be calculated from the power \ndissipation, ambient temperature, and package thermal resistance . \nThe thermal resistance is a function not only of the package, but \nalso of the circuit board layout. Standard test conditions are used  to \ndetermine the valu es published in this data sheet, but actual \nperformance will vary. For an LFCSP -8 package mounted on a \nstandard 4 -layer board, θ JA is 48 °C/W . In the above example, where  \nthe power dissipation is 700 mW , the temperature rise above \nambient will be approximately equal to  \n∆TJA = 0.700 W × 48°C/W = 33.6°C  \nTo limit the maximum junction temperature to 150 °C, the \nmaximum allowable ambient temperature will be  \nTAMAX = 150°C − 33.6°C = 116.4°C  \nIn this case, the resulting ambient temperature limitation is above the max imum allowable ambient temperature of 85 °C. \n \n \n \n   \n \nData Sheet ADP3335 \n \nRev. D | Page 11 of 16 PRINTED CIRCUIT BOAR D LAYOUT \nCONSIDERATIONS  \nAll surface -mount packages rely on the traces of the PC board to  \nconduct heat away from the package. Use the following general \nguidelines when designing printed circuit boards to improve both electrical and thermal performance.  \n1. Keep the output capacitor as close as possible to the output and ground pins.  \n2. Keep the input capacitor as close as possible to the input and ground pins.  \n3. PC board traces with larger cross s ectional areas will remove  \nmore heat from the ADP3335. For optimum heat transfer, \nspecify thick copper and use wide traces.  \n4. It is not recommended to use solder mask or silkscreen on the PCB tra ces adjacent to the ADP3335’s pins, since doing \nso will increase the junction -to-ambient thermal resistance \nof the package.  \n5. Use additional copper layers or planes to reduce the thermal  \nresistan ce. When connecting to other layers, use multiple \nvias, if possible.  \nLFCSP LAYOUT CONSIDE RATIONS  \nThe LFCSP package has an exposed die paddle on the bottom, \nwhich efficiently conducts heat to the PCB. In order to achieve \nthe optimum performance from the LFC SP package, special \nconsideration must be given to the layout of the PCB. Use the \nfollowing layout guidelines for the LFCSP package.  \n0.502× VIAS, 0.250 ∅\n35µm PLA TING\n3.360.901.80\n2.36\n1.901.400.300.73\n00147-0-024 \nFigure 25. 3 mm × 3 mm LFCSP Pad Pattern  \n(Dimensions shown in millimeters)  \n1. The pad pattern is gi ven in Figure 25. The pad dimension \nshould be followed closely for reliable solder joints, while \nmaintaining reasonable clearances to prevent solder bridging.  2. The thermal pad of the LFCSP package provides a low \nthermal impedance pa th (approximately 20°C/W) to the \nPCB. Therefore, the PCB must be properly designed to effectively conduct heat away from the package. This is \nachieved by adding thermal vias to the PCB, which provide \na thermal path to the inner or bottom layers. See Figure 25 \nfor th e recommended via pattern. Note that the via diam eter \nis small to prevent the solder from flowing through the via \nand leaving voids in the thermal pad solder joint.  \nAlso, note that the thermal pad is attached to the die s ubstrate , \nso the thermal planes to which the thermal vias connect \nmust be electrically isolated or tied to V\nIN. Do NOT connect  \nthe thermal pad to ground.  \n3. The solder mask opening should be about 120 µ (4.7 mils) \nlarger than the pad size, resulting in a mini mum 60 µm  \n(2.4 mils) clearance between the pad and the solder mask.  \n4. The paste mask opening is typically designed to match the \npad size used on the peripheral pads of the LFCSP package. This should provide a reliable solder joint as long as the stencil  \nthickness is about 0.125 mm. The paste mask for the thermal  \npad needs to be designed for the maximum coverage to effectively remove the heat from the package. However, due to the presence of thermal vias and the size of the thermal pad,  \neliminating voids may n ot be possible.  \n5. The recommended paste mask stencil thickness is 0.125 mm . \nA laser cut stainless steel stencil with trapezoidal walls should  \nbe used. A “No Clean” Type 3 solder paste should be used \nfor mounting the LFCSP package. Also, a nitrogen purge \nduring the reflow process is recommended.  \n6. The package manufacturer recommends that the reflow \ntemperature should not exceed 220°C and the time above liquidus is less than 75 seconds. The preheat ramp should be 3°C/second or lower. The actual temperature profil e \ndepends on the board density and must be determined by the assembly house as to what works best.  \nSHUTDOWN MODE  \nApplying a TTL high signal to the shutdown ( SD) pin or tying it \nto the input pin, turns the output ON. Pulling SD down to 0.4 V \nor below, or tying it to ground, turns the output OFF. In shutdown  \nmode, quiescent current is reduced to a typical value of 10 nA.  \n \n  \n \nADP3335 Data Sheet \n \nRev.
