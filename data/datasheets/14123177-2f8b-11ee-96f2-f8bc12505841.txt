When paired with a DS90UB953-\nQ1 serializer,  the DS90UB954-Q1 receives data \nfrom imagers, supporting 2MP/60fps and 4MP/30fps \ncameras as well as satellite RADAR and other \nsensors such as ToF and LIDAR. Data is received \nand aggregated into a MIPI CSI-2 compliant output \nfor interconnect to a downstream processor.  For \nsensors with DS90UB933-Q1 and DS90UB913A-\nQ1 serializers, the  DS90UB954-Q1 receives and \naggregates data from one or two sensors including \nFull HD 1080p 2MP 60/fps imager sensors.  When \nconfiguring the CSI-2 interface for 2-lane operation, \na duplicate MIPI CSI-2 clock lane is available to \nprovide a replicated output. Replication mode creates \ntwo copies of the aggregated  video stream for data \nlogging and parallel processing.\nThe DS90UB954-Q1 and partner DS90UB953-Q1 \nchipset  is AEC-Q100 qualified and designed to \nreceive data across either 50- Ω single-ended coaxial \nor 100- Ω differential STP cables. The deserializer \nhub is ideal for Power-over-Coax applications and the \nreceive equalizer automatically adapts to compensate \nfor cable loss characteristics with no additional \nprogramming required, including cable degradation \nover time.\nEach FPD-Link III interface includes a separate \nlow latency bidirectional control channel (BCC) \nthat continuously conveys I2C, GPIO, and other \ncontrol information. GPIO signals purposed for sensor \nsynchronization and diagnostic features also make \nuse of the BCC.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE (1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nDS90UB954-Q1 VQFN (48) 7.00 mm × 7.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nMIPI CSI-2\nProcessor  \nSoCDS90UB954-Q1\nFPD-Link III\nDeserializer  D3P/N\nCLKP/NDS90UB953\nFPD-Link III \nSerializer\nI2C\nGPIOFPD-Link III\nCoax or STP\nD2P/N\nD1P/N\nD0P/N\nDS90UB953\nFPD-Link III \nSerializer\nTypical Application SchematicDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C  – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

When coupled with \nan ADAS FPD-Link III serializer ( DS90UB953-Q1,  DS90UB935-Q1,  DS90UB933-Q1 or DS90UB913A-Q1), \nthe DS90UB954-Q1  receives data streams from multiple sensors to be multiplexed on the same CSI-2 links. \nWhen paired with the DS90UB953-Q1 or the DS90UB935-Q1, the DS90UB954-Q1 operates at full features, \nand in backwards compatible mode with DS90UB933-Q1 serializer or DS90UB913A-Q1, operates with basic \nfunctionality.\nTable 7-1. Serializer Compatibility\nSerializer DS90UB935-Q1 DS90UB953-Q1 DS90UB933-Q1 DS90UB913A-Q1\nCompatibility Yes Yes Yes Yes\n7.1.1 Functional Description\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  FPD-Link III Deserializer, in conjunction with an ADAS FPD-Link III serializer supports \nthe video transport needs with an ultra-high speed forward channel and an embedded bidirectional control \nchannel. The DS90UB954-Q1  received data is output from a configurable MIPI CSI-2 port. The CSI-2 port \nmay be configured as either a single CSI-2 output with four lanes up to 1.662 Gbps per lane or as two 2 \nlane CSI-2 outputs for sending replicated data on both ports. A second differential clock is available for the \nsecond replicated output when configured for dual CSI-2 outputs supporting one clock lane and one or two data \nlanes each. The DS90UB954-Q1  can support multiple data formats and different resolutions as provided by the \nsensor. Conversion between different data formats is not supported. The CSI-2 Tx module accommodates both \nimage data and non-image data (including synchronization or embedded data packets).\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  CSI-2 interface combines each of the sensor data streams into packets designated for \neach virtual channel. The output generated is composed of virtual channels to separate different streams to be \ninterleaved. Each virtual channel is identified by a unique channel identification number in the packet header.\nWhen the DS90UB954-Q1  is paired with a DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1  serializer, the received FPD-Link \nIII forward channel is constructed in 40-bit long frames. Each encoded frame contains video payload data, I2C \nforward channel data, and additional information on framing, data integrity and link diagnostics. The high-speed, \nserial bit stream from the DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1  contains an embedded clock and DC-balancing \nensuring sufficient data line transitions for enhanced signal quality. When paired with ADAS serializers in RAW \ninput mode, the received FPD-Link III forward channel is similarly constructed at a lower line rate in 28-bit long \nframes. The DS90UB954-Q1  device recovers a high-speed, FPD-Link III forward channel signal and generates \na bidirectional control channel control signal in the reverse channel direction. The DS90UB954-Q1  converts \nthe FPD-Link III stream into a MIPI CSI-2 output interface designed to support automotive sensors, including \n2MP/60fps and 4MP/30fps  image sensors .\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  device has two receive input ports to accept up to two sensor streams simultaneously. \nThe control channel function of the DS90UB95x-Q1  chipset provides bidirectional communication between the \nimage sensors and ECU. The integrated bidirectional control channel transfers data bidirectionally over the \nsame differential pair used for video data interface. This interface offers advantages over other chipsets by \neliminating the need for additional wires for programming and control. The bidirectional control channel bus is \ncontrolled through an I2C port. The bidirectional control channel offers continuous low latency communication \nand is not dependent on video blanking intervals. The DS90UB95x-Q1  chipset can operate entirely off of the \nback channel frequency clock generated by the DS90UB954-Q1  and recovered by the DS90UB953-Q1 or \nDS90UB935-Q1 . The DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1  provides the reference clock source for the sensor \nbased on the recovered back channel clock. Synchronous clocking mode provides distinct advantages in a multi-\nsensor system by locking all of the sensors and the receiver to a common reference in the same clock domain, \nwhich reduces or eliminates the need for data buffering and re-synchronization. This mode also eliminates the \ncost, space, and potential failure point of a reference oscillator within the sensor. The DS90UB95x-Q1  chipset \noffer customers the choice to work with different clocking schemes. The DS90UB95x-Q1  chipset can also use DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nan external oscillator as the reference clock source for the PLL or CSI CLK from the sensor  as the primary \nreference clock to the serializer (see the DS90UB953-Q1  data sheet).\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nRIN0±RIN0+\nTiming and \nControlFIFOEncoder\nI2C Controller\nEncoder\nCSI Encoder\nData Output\nClock \nGenRT RT \nPDB\nBISTENRIN1±RIN1+CSI_CLK[0,1]\nGPIO[6:0]\nXIN/REFCLK\nLOCK\nPASSIDX\nSDA\nSCL74\nVDD_SEL\nMODE\nCMLOUTP\nCMLOUTNXOUT\nDiagnosticsLDO\nLDO\nLDO\nLDOCSI_DATA[3:0]8AEQ\nDeserializer\nCDRAEQ\nDeserializerCDR\nDecoder\nFigure 7-1. Functional Block Diagram\n7.3 Feature Description\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  provides a flexible deserializer for automotive sensor applications. The device includes two \nFPD-Link III inputs for sensor data streams from one or two DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1  serializers. \nThe FPD-Link III interface is also backward  compatible with DS90UB933-Q1 and DS90UB913A-Q1 ADAS \nserializers. Data received from the two input ports is aggregated onto a CSI-2 TX output with up to 4 data lanes.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  supports two main FPD-Link III  operating modes:\n•CSI-2 Mode (DS90UB953-Q1 and DS90UB935-Q1 compatible)\n•RAW Mode (DS90UB913A-Q1 and DS90UB933-Q1 compatible)\nThe two modes mainly  control the FPD-Link III receiver operation of the device. In both cases, the output format \nfor the device is CSI-2 through the CSI-2 transmit port.\nEach input port can be individually configured for CSI-2 or RAW modes of operation.\nThe input mode of operation is controlled by the FPD3_MODE (Register 0x6D[1:0]) setting in the Port \nConfiguration register. The input mode may also be controlled by the MODE strap pin.\n7.4.1 CSI-2 Mode\nWhen operating in CSI-2 FPD-Link III input mode (with DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1 ), the DS90UB954-\nQ1 receives CSI-2 formatted data on one or two FPD-Link III input ports and forwards the data to the \nCSI-2 transmit port. The deserializer can operate in CSI-2 mode with synchronous back channel reference \nor non-synchronous mode. The forward channel line rate is independent of the CSI-2 rate in synchronous or \nnon-synchronous with external clock mode. Each CSI-2 mode supports remapping of Virtual Channel IDs at the \nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\ninput of each receive port. This allows handling of conflicting VC-IDs for input streams from dual sensors and \nsending those streams to the same CSI-2 transmit port.\nIn CSI-2 mode each deserializer Rx Port can support an FPD-Link line rate up to 4.16 Gbps , where the forward \nchannel and back channel rates are based on the reference frequency used for the serializer:\n•In Synchronous mode based on REFCLK input frequency reference, the FPD-Link line rate is a fixed value \nof 160 × REFCLK. FPD3_PCLK = 4 × REFCLK and Back channel rate = 2 × REFCLK. For example with \nREFCLK = 25 MHz, line rate = 4.0 Gbps, FPD3_PCLK = 100 MHz, back channel data rate = 50 Mbps. The \nsensor CSI-2 rate is independent of the line rate and Tx CSI-2 rate in synchronous clocking mode and can be \nup to 3.328 Gbps.\n•In Non-synchronous clocking mode when the DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1  uses external reference \nclock (f CLKIN ) the FPD-Link line rate is typically f CLKIN  × 80, FPD3_PCLK = 2 × f CLKIN  or 1 x f CLKIN  and back \nchannel data rate is set to 10 Mbps. For example, with f CLKIN  = 50 MHz, line rate = 4Gbps, FPD3_PCLK = \n100 MHz, and the back channel rate is 10 Mbps. The sensor CSI-2 rate is independent of the f CLKIN .\n7.4.2 RAW Mode\nWhen operating in Raw FPD-Link III input mode, the DS90UB954-Q1  receives RAW10 or RAW12 data from a \nDS90UB9x3x-Q1  serializer. The data is translated into a RAW10 or RAW12 CSI-2 video stream for forwarding to \nthe CSI-2 transmit port. For each input port, the CSI-2 packet header VC-ID and Data Type are programmable.\nDVP RAW8 data format is also supported in serializer RAW10 transmit mode with 8/10 data input bits (MSB or \nLSB) connected to the serializer DVP source. DVP format serializer inputs must have discrete synch signals. \nWhen paired with DS90UB913A-Q1 or DS90UB933-Q1  serializers, the DS90UB954-Q1  utilizes the HSYNC and \nVSYNC inputs to construct the MIPI CSI-2 Tx data packets. Ensure the Frame Valid to Line Valid setup time is \nconfigured appropriately for DVP input system use cases as a minimum setup timing is required as per Table \n7-11.\nIn RAW mode the DS90UB954-Q1  deserializer each Rx Port can support up to:\n•12 bits of DATA + 2 SYNC bits for an input PCLK range of 37.5 MHz to 100 MHz (75 MHz for 913A-Q1) in \nthe 12-bit, high frequency mode. Line rate = f PCLK × (2/3) × 28; for example, f PCLK = 100 MHz, line rate = (100 \nMHz) × (2/3) × 28 = 1.87 Gbps. Note: No HS/VS restrictions (raw).\n•10 bits of DATA + 2 SYNC bits for an input PCLK range of 50 MHz to 100 MHz in the 10-bit mode. Line rate \n= fPCLK/2 × 28; for example, f PCLK = 100 MHz, line rate = (100 MHz/2) × 28 = 1.40 Gbps. Note: HS/VS is \nrestricted to no more than one transition per 10 PCLK cycles.\n•12 bits of DATA + 2 bits SYNC for an input PCLK range of 25 MHz to 50 MHz in the 12-bit low frequency \nmode. Note: No HS/VS restrictions (raw).\nWhen operating with DVP serializer, the DS90UB954-Q1  deserializer also supports DVP formats such as \nYUV-422 which have the same pixel packing as RAW8, RAW10 or RAW12. For example; there are 3 YUV CSI-2 \ndata types that have the same pixel packing as RAW10: YUV420 10 bit, YUV420 10 bit Chroma shifted or \nYUV422 10bit. These formats can be used as well as 8 bit and 12 bit YUV formats which adhere to the same \nstructure as RAW8 and RAW12 respectively.\n7.4.3 RX MODE Pin\nConfiguration of the FPD-Link III operating input mode may be done through the MODE input strap pin, or \nthrough the configuration register bits. A pullup resistor and a pull-down resistor of suggested values may be \nused to set the voltage ratio of the MODE input (V TARGET ) and V (VDD18)  to select one of the 8 possible selected \nmodes. The DS90UB954-Q1  waits 1 ms after PDB goes high to allow time for power supply transients before \nsampling the MODE pin strap value and configuring the device to set the I2C address.

The \nREFCLK frequency defines all internal clock timers, including the back channel rate, I2C timers, CSI-2 datarate, \nFrameSync signal parameters, and other timing critical internal circuitry. REFCLK input must be continuous. If \nthe REFCLK input does not detect a transition more than 20 µS, this may cause a disruption in the CSI-2 output. \nREFCLK should be applied to the DS90UB954-Q1  only when the supply rails are above minimum levels (see \nSection 9.2). At start-up, the DS90UB954-Q1  defaults to an internal oscillator to generate an backup internal \nreference clock at nominal frequency of 25 MHz ±10%.\nThe REFCLK LVCMOS input oscillator specifications are listed in Table 7-3 .\nTable 7-3.

The Receiver \nport control register RX_PORT_CTL 0x0C ( Table 7-31 ) allows for disabling one or both of the Rx inputs when \nnot in use. These bits can only be written by a local I2C controller at the deserializer side of the FPD-Link.\nEach FPD-Link III Receive port has a unique set of registers that provides control and status corresponding to \nRx port 0 or Rx port 1. Control of the FPD-Link III port registers is assigned by the FPD3_PORT_SEL register, \nwhich sets the page controls for reading or writing individual ports unique registers. For each of the FPD-Link \nIII Receive Ports, the FPD3_PORT_SEL 0x4C register defaults to selecting that port’s registers as detailed in \nregister description ( Table 7-86 ).\nAs an alternative to paging to access FPD-Link III Receive unique port registers, separate I2C addresses \nmay be enabled to allow direct access to the port-specific registers. The Port I2C address registers allow \nprogramming a separate 7-bit I2C address to allow access to unique, port-specific registers without paging. I2C \ncommands to these assigned I2C addresses are also allowed access to all shared registers (see Table 7-179 ).\n7.4.6.1 Video Stream Forwarding\nVideo stream forwarding is handled by the Rx Port forwarding control in register 0x20 (see Section 7.6.33 ). \nForwarding from input ports are disabled by default and must be enabled using per-port controls. Different \noptions for forwarding CSI-2 packets can also be selected as described starting in Section 7.4.28 .\n7.4.7 LOCK and PASS Status\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  provides dedicated PASS and LOCK outputs for monitoring status as well as through the \nDEVICE_STS register (address 0x04).The source of the deserializer LOCK and PASS signals for pin monitoring DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nand interrupt operation is also controlled by the LOCK_SEL and PASS_SEL fields in the RX_PORT_CTL \nregister. The source of the LOCK and PASS can be allocated to either of the following system use cases: 00: \nPort 0 Receiver, 01: Port 1 Receiver, 10: Any Enabled Receiver Port (Logical OR), and 11: All Enabled Receiver \nPorts (logical AND). At start-up, the deserializer will synchronize with the input signal provided by the serializer \nand assert the LOCK indication once stable. The lock detect circuit includes an option to check for link bit errors \nas part of the lock detection and determine if LOCK is lost. The Receive Port Lock status is available for each \nport through the RX_PORT_STS1 register 0x4D. The LOCK status may also be used to enable video forwarding \nand other options. I2C communication across the FPD-Link should be attempted only during LOCK condition.\nIn RAW12 HF mode, the LOCK pin is only high if there is a link with a serializer that has an active PCLK input. \nLOCK is low if there is a serializer connected and there is a link established using the internal oscillator of the \nserializer. Therefore, when using this mode, it is preferred to use the port-specific LOCK_STS register (0x4D[0]), \nwhich is high when linked to a serializer with internal oscillator. This LOCK_STS signal can also be an output to \na GPIO pin for monitoring in real time. Once LOCK_STS is high for a specific port, remote I2C is available to that \nserializer. In RAW 10-bit mode, the LOCK pin is high when there is a link with a serializer regardless of whether \nthere is an active PCLK input. The port-specific LOCK_STS register is also valid in either of these modes.\nIf the deserializer loses LOCK, the receiver will reset and perform the LOCK algorithm again to reacquire the \nserial data stream sent by the serializer. The receive port will truncate video frames containing errors and \nresume forwarding the video when LOCK is re-established.\nThe Receive port will indicate Pass status once specific conditions are met, including a number of valid frames \nreceived. Valid frames may include requiring no link bit errors and consistent frame size including video line \nlength or number of video lines. The receive port may be programmed to truncate video frames containing errors \nand prevent the forwarding of video until the Pass conditions are met.\n7.4.8 Input Jitter Tolerance\nInput jitter tolerance is the ability of the Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) Phase-Lock Loop ( PLL) of the receiver \nto track and recover the incoming serial data stream. Jitter tolerance at a specific frequency is the maximum \njitter permissible before data errors occur. The following shows the allowable total jitter of the receiver inputs and \nmust be less than the values in the chart.\nAmplitude\n(UI p-p)\ng (MHz)A1\nA2\ng1 g2\nFigure 7-4.

Each RX port signal path continuously \nmonitors cable characteristics for long-term cable aging and temperature changes. The AEQ is primarily \nintended to adapt and compensate for channel losses over the lifetime of a cable installed in an automobile. \nThe AEQ attempts to optimize the equalization setting of the RX receiver. This adaption includes compensating \ninsertion loss from temperature effects and aging degradation due to bending and flexion. To determine the \nmaximum cable reach, factors that affect signal integrity such as jitter, skew, inter-symbol interference (ISI), \ncrosstalk, and so forth, must also be considered. The equalization configuration and status are programmed in \nregisters 0xD2–0xD3 (see Table 7-159 ).\n7.4.9.1 Adaptive Equalizer Algorithm\nThe AEQ process steps through allowed values of the equalizer controls find a value that allows the Clock Data \nRecovery (CDR) circuit to maintain valid lock condition. For each EQ setting, the circuit waits for a programmed \nre-lock time period, then checks results for valid lock. If valid lock is detected, the circuit will stop at the current \nEQ setting and maintain constant value as long as lock state persists. If the deserializer loses LOCK, the \nadaptive equalizer will resume the LOCK algorithm and the EQ setting is incremented to the next valid state. \nOnce lock is lost, the circuit will continue searching EQ settings to find a valid setting to reacquire the serial data \nstream sent by the serializer that remains locked.\n7.4.9.2 AEQ Settings\n7.4.9.2.1 AEQ Start-Up and Initialization\nThe AEQ circuit can be restarted at any time by setting the AEQ_RESTART bit in the AEQ_CTL2 register 0xD2 \n(see Table 7-159 ). Once the deserializer is powered on, the AEQ is continually searching through EQ settings \nand could be at any setting when signal is supplied from the serializer. If the Rx Port CDR locks to the signal, it \nmay be good enough for low bit errors, but could be not optimized or over-equalized. The DS90UB954-Q1  when \nconnected to a ADAS serializer ( DS90UB953-Q1,  DS90UB935-Q1,  DS90UB933-Q1, or DS90UB913A-Q1) will \nby default restart the AEQ adaption upon achieving first positive lock indication to provide more consistent start-\nup from known conditions. With this feature disabled, the AEQ may lock at a relatively random EQ setting based \non when the FPD-Link III input signal is initially present. Alternatively, AEQ_RESTART or DIGITAL_RESET0 \ncould be applied once the ADAS serializer input signal frequency is stable to restart adaption from the minimum \nEQ gain value. These techniques allow for a more consistent initial EQ setting following adaption.\n7.4.9.2.2 AEQ Range\nAEQ Min/Max settings: The AEQ circuit can be programmed with minimum and maximum settings used during \nthe EQ adaption. Using the full AEQ range will provide the most flexible solution, however if the channel \nconditions are known an improved deserializer lock time can be achieved by narrowing the search window for \nallowable EQ gain settings. For example in a system use case with a longer cable and multiple interconnects \ncreating higher channel attenuation, the AEQ would not adapt to the minimum EQ gain settings. Likewise in a \nsystem use case with short cable and low channel attenuation AEQ would not generally adapt to the highest \nEQ gain settings. The AEQ range is determined by the AEQ_MIN_MAX register 0xD5 (see Section 7.6.144 ) \nwhere AEQ_MAX sets the maximum value of EQ gain. The ADAPTIVE_EQ_FLOOR_VALUE determines the \nstarting value for EQ gain adaption. To enable the minimum AEQ limit, SET_AEQ_FLOOR bit in the AEQ_CTL2 \nregister 0xD2[2] must also be set. An AEQ range (AEQ_MAX - AEQ_FLOOR) to allow a variation around the \nnominal setting of –2/+4 or ±3 around the nominal AEQ value specific to Rx port channel characteristics provides \na good trade off in lock time and adaptability. The setting for the AEQ after adaption can be readback from the \nAEQ_STATUS register 0xD3 (see Section 7.6.142 ).\n7.4.9.2.3 AEQ Timing\nThe dwell time for AEQ to wait for lock or error free status is also programmable. When checking each EQ \nsetting the AEQ will wait for a time interval, controlled by the ADAPTIVE_EQ_RELOCK_TIME field in the \nAEQ_CTL2 register (see Table 7-159 ) before incrementing to the next allowable EQ gain setting. The default \nwait time is set to 2.62 ms based on REFCLK = 25 MHz. Once the maximum setting is reached, if there is DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n32 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nno lock acquired during the programmed relock time, the AEQ will restart adaption at the minimum setting or \nAEQ_FLOOR value.\n7.4.9.2.4 AEQ Threshold\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  receiver will by default adapt based on FPD-Link error checking during the Adaptive \nEqualization process. The specific errors linked to equalizer adaption, FPD-Link III clock recovery error, packet \nencoding error, and parity error can be individually selected in AEQ_CTL1 register 0x42 (see Section 7.6.63 ). \nErrors are accumulated over 1/2 of the period of the timer set by the ADAPTIVE_EQ_RELOCK_TIME. If the \nnumber of errors is greater than the programmed threshold (AEQ_ERR_THOLD), the AEQ will attempt to \nincrease the EQ setting.\n7.4.10 Channel Monitor Loop-Through Output Driver (CMLOUT)\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  includes an internal Channel Monitor Loop-through output on the CMLOUTP and \nCMLOUTN pins. A buffered loop-through output driver is provided on the CMLOUTP and CMLOUTN for \nobserving jitter after equalization for each of the two RX receive channels. The CMLOUT monitors the post \nEQ stage thus providing the recovered input of the deserializer signal. The measured serial data width on the \nCMLOUT loop-through is the total jitter including the internal driver, AEQ, back channel echo, and so forth. Each \nchannel also has its own CMLOUT monitor and can be used for debug purposes. This CMLOUT is useful in \nidentifying gross signal conditioning issues.\nTable 7-7  includes details on selecting the corresponding RX receiver of CMLOUTP and CMLOUTN \nconfiguration. To disable the CMLOUT, either follow the instructions in table to reload register default values, \nor reset the DS90UB954-Q1 .\nTable 7-6.

This information is latched into the RX port status registers \nRX_PORT_STS1 (0x4D) and RX_PORT_STS2 (0x4E). There are bits to flag any change in LOCK status \n(LOCK_STS_CHG) or detect any errors in the control channel over the forward link (BCC_CRC_ERROR, \nBCC_SEQ_ERROR) which are cleared upon read. The Rx Port status registers also allow the user to monitor \nthe presence of the stable input signal, along with parity and CRC errors, line length, and lines per video frame.\n7.4.11.1 RX Parity Status\nThe FPD-Link III receiver checks the decoded data parity to detect any errors in the received FPD-Link III \nframe. Parity errors are counted up and accessible through the RX_PAR_ERR_HI and RX_PAR_ERR_LO \nregisters 0x55 and 0x56 to provide combined 16-bit error counter. In addition, a parity error flag can be \nset once a programmed number of parity errors have been detected. This condition is indicated by the \nPARITY_ERROR flag in the RX_PORT_STS1 register. Reading the counter value will clear the counter value \nand PARITY_ERROR flag. An interrupt may also be generated based on assertion of the parity error flag. By \ndefault, the parity error counter will be cleared and the flag will be cleared on loss of Receiver lock. To ensure \nan exact read of the parity error counter, parity checking should be disabled in the GENERAL_CFG register 0x02 \nbefore reading the counter.\n7.4.11.2 FPD-Link Decoder Status\nThe FPD-Link III receiver also checks the decoded data for encoding or sequence errors in the received \nFPD-Link III frame. If either of these error conditions are detected the FPD3_ENC_ERROR bit will be latched \nin the RX_PORT_STS2 register 0x4E[5]. An interrupt may also be generated based on assertion of the \nencoded error flag. To detect FPD-Link III Encoder errors, the LINK_ERROR_COUNT must be enabled with DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\na LINK_ERR_THRESH value greater than 1. Otherwise, the loss of Receiver Lock will prevent detection of the \nEncoder error. The FPD3_ENC_ERROR flag is cleared on read.\nWhen partnered with a DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1 , the FPD3 Encoder may be configured to include a \nCRC check of the FPD3 encoder sequence. The CRC check provides an extra layer of error checking on the \nencoder sequence. This CRC checking adds protection to the encoder sequence used to send link information \ncomprised of Datapath Control (registers 0x59 and 0x5A), Sensor Status (registers 0x51-0x54), and Serializer \nID (register 0x5B). TI recommends enabling the CRC error checking on the FPD3 Encoder sequence to prevent \nany updates of link information values from encoded packets that do not pass CRC check. The FPD3 Encoder \nCRC is enabled by setting the FPD3_ENC_CRC_DIS (register 0xBA[7] Table 7-151 ) to 0. In addition, the \nFPD3_ENC_CRC_CAP flag should be set in register 0x4A[4] (see Section 7.6.66 ).\n7.4.11.3 RX Port Input Signal Detection\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  can detect and measure the approximate input frequency and frequency stability of \neach RX input port and indicate status in bits [2:1] of RX_PORT_STS2. Frequency measurement stable \nFREQ_STABLE indicates the FPD-Link III input clock frequency is stable. When no FPD-Link III input clock is \ndetected at the RX input port the CABLE_FAULT bit indicates that condition has occurred. Setting of these error \nflags is dependent on the stability control settings in the FREQ_DET_CTL register 0x77. The CABLE_FAULT \nbit will be set if the input frequency is below the setting programmed in the FREQ_LO_THR setting in the \nFREQ_DET_CTL register. A change in frequency FREQ_STABLE = 0, is defined as any change in MHz greater \nthan the value programmed in the FREQ_HYST value. The frequency is continually monitored and provided for \nreadback through the I2C interface less than every 1 ms. A 16-bit value is used to provide the frequency in units \nof 2 to 8 MHz. An interrupt can also be generated for any of the ports to indicate if a change in frequency is \ndetected on any port.\n7.4.11.4 Line Counter\nFor each video frame received, the deserializer will count the number of video lines in the frame. In CSI-2 input \nmode, any long packet will be counted as a video line. In RAW mode, any assertion of the Line Valid (LV) signal \nwill be interpreted as a video line. The LINE_COUNT_1 and LINE_COUNT_0 registers in 0x73 and 0x74 can be \nused to read the line count for the most recent video frame. Line Length may not be consistent when receiving \nmultiple CSI-2 video streams differentiated by VC-ID. An interrupt may be enabled based on a change in the \nLINE_COUNT value. If interrupts are enabled, the LINE_COUNT registers will be latched at the interrupt and \nheld until read back by the processor through I2C.\n7.4.11.5 Line Length\nFor each video line, the length (in bytes) will be determined. The LINE_LEN_1 and LINE_LEN_0 registers 0x75 \nand 0x76 can be used to read the line count for the most recent video frame. If the line length is not stable \nthroughout the frame, the length of the last line of the frame will be reported. Line Count may not be consistent \nwhen receiving multiple CSI-2 video streams differentiated by VC-ID. An interrupt may be enabled based on a \nchange in the LINE_LEN value. If interrupts are enabled, the LINE_LEN registers will be latched at the interrupt \nand held until read by the processor through I2C.\n7.4.12 Sensor Status\nWhen paired with the DS90UB935-Q1  or DS90UB953-Q1  serializer, the DS90UB954-Q1  is capable of receiving \ndiagnostic indicators from the serializer. The sensor alarm and status diagnostic information are reported in the \nSENSOR_STS_X registers (0x51 to 0x54 in Table 7-92 ). The interrupt capability from detected status changes \nin sensor are described in Section 7.5.8.2.2 . Sensor Status This interrupt condition will be cleared by reading the \nSEN_INT_RISE_STS and SEN_INT_FALL_STS registers (registers 0xDE and 0xDF).\n7.4.13 GPIO Support\nIn addition to the dedicated LOCK and PASS output pins, the DS90UB954-Q1  supports seven pins, GPIO0 \nthrough GPIO6, which can be monitored, configured, and controlled through I2C in registers 0x0E - 0x16. \nGPIO3 programmable I/O pin is an active-low open drain and is shared with INTB. The current status of all \nGPIO can be readback from register 0x0E. Each GPIO is programmable for multiple uses options through the \nGPIOx_PIN_CTL registers 0x10 - 0x16.\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 35\n7.4.13.1 GPIO Input Control and Status\nUpon initialization GPIO0 through GPIO6 are enabled as inputs by default. Each GPIO pin has an input disable \nand a pulldown disable control bit, with the exception of GPIO3 which is open drain. By default, the GPIO \npin input paths are enabled and the internal pulldown circuit for the GPIO is enabled. The GPIO_INPUT_CTL \n(0x0F) and GPIO_PD_CTL (0xBE) registers allow control of the input enable and the pulldown, respectively. For \nexample, to disable GPIO1 and GPIO2 as inputs the user would program in register 0x0F[2:1] = 11. For most \napplications, there is no need to modify the default register settings for the pulldown resistors. The status HIGH \nor LOW of each GPIO pin 0 through 6 may be read through the GPIO_PIN_STS register 0x0E. This register \nread operation provides the status of the GPIO pin independent of whether the GPIO pin is configured as an \ninput or output.\n7.4.13.2 GPIO Output Pin Control\nIndividual GPIO output pin control is programmable through the GPIOx_PIN_CTL registers 0x10 to 0x16 ( Table \n7-35). To enable any of the GPIO as output, set bit 0 = 1 in the respective register 0x10 to 0x16 after clearing the \ncorresponding input enable bit in register 0x0F ( Table 7-34 ). The configuration register for each GPIO is listed in \nTable 7-8 .\n7.4.13.3 \nFigure 7-6.

The remote Serializer GPIO are mapped to GPIO. Each \nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 37\nGPIO pin can be programmed for output mode and mapped. Up to four GPIOs are supported in the forward \ndirection on each FPD-Link III Receive port (see Table 7-99 ). Each forward channel GPIO (from any port) can \nbe mapped to any GPIO output pin. The DS90UB933-Q1 and DS90UB913A-Q1 GPIOs cannot be configured as \ninputs for remote communication over the forward channel to the DS90UB954-Q1 .\nThe timing for the forward channel GPIO is dependant on the number of GPIOs assigned at the serializer. \nWhen a single GPIO input from the DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1  serializer is linked to a DS90UB954-Q1 \ndeserializer, the GPIO output value is sampled every forward channel transmit frame. Two linked GPIO are \nsampled every two forward channel frames and three or four linked GPIO are sampled every five frames. The \ntypical minimum latency for the GPIO remains consistent (approximately 225 ns), but as the information gets \nspread over multiple frames, the jitter is typically increased on the order of the sampling period (number of \nforward channel frames). TI recommends maintaining a 4x oversampling ratio for linked GPIO throughput. For \nexample, when operating in 4-Gbps synchronous mode with REFCLK = 25 MHz, the maximum recommended \nGPIO input frequency based on the number of GPIO linked over the forward channel is shown in Table 7-9 .\nTable 7-9. Forward Channel GPIO Typical Timing\nNUMBER OF LINKED \nFORWARD CHANNEL GPIOs\n(FC_GPIO_EN Table 7-99 )SAMPLING FREQUENCY (MHz)\nAT FPD-Link III LINE RATE = 4 \nGbpsMAXIMUM RECOMMENDED \nFORWARD CHANNEL GPIO \nFREQUENCY (MHz)TYPICAL JITTER (ns)\n1 100 25 12\n2 50 12.5 24\n4 20 5 60\nIn addition to mapping remote serializer GPI, an internally generated FrameSync (see Section 7.4.27 ) or other \ncontrol signals may be output from any of the deserializer GPIOs for synchronization with a local processor or \nanother deserializer.\n7.4.13.5 Back Channel GPIO\nEach DS90UB954-Q1  GPIO pin defaults to input mode at start-up. The deserializer can link GPIO pin input data \non up to four available slots to send on the back channel per each remote serializer connection. Any of the \nseven GPIO pin data can be mapped to send over the available back channel slots for each FPD-Link III Rx \nport. The same GPIO on the deserializer pin can be mapped to multiple back channel GPIO signals. For each \n50-Mbps back channel operation, the frame period is 600 ns (30 bits × 20 ns/bit). For 2.5-Mbps back channel \noperation , the frame period is 12 µs (30 bits × 400 ns/bit). As the back channel GPIOs are sampled and sent \neach back channel frame by the DS90UB954-Q1  deserializer, the latency and jitter timing are each on the order \nof one back channel frame. The back channel GPIO is effectively sampled at a rate of 1/30 of the back channel \nrate or 1.67 MHz at f BC = 50 Mbps. TI recommends that the input to back channel GPIO switching frequency is \n< 1/4 of the sampling rate or 416 kHz at f BC = 50 Mbps. For example, when operating in 4-Gbps synchronous \nmode with REFCLK = 25 MHz, the maximum recommended GPIO input frequency based on the data rate when \nlinked over the back channel is shown in Table 7-10 .\nTable 7-10. Back Channel GPIO Typical Timing\nBACK CHANNEL RATE \n(Mbps)SAMPLING FREQUENCY \n(kHz)MAXIMUM \nRECOMMENDED BACK \nCHANNEL GPIO \nFREQUENCY (kHz)TYPICAL LATENCY (us) TYPICAL JITTER (us)\n50 1670 416 1.5 0.7\n10 334 83.5 3.2 3\n2.5 83.5 20 12.2 12\nIn addition to sending GPIO from pins, an internally generated FrameSync or external FrameSync input signal \nmay be mapped to any of the back channel GPIOs for synchronization of multiple sensors with extremely low \nskew. (see Section 7.4.27 ).\nFor each port, GPIO control is available through the BC_GPIO_CTL0 register 0x6E (see Table 7-120 ) and \nBC_GPIO_CTL1 register 0x6F (see Table 7-121 ).DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n38 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.4.13.6 Other GPIO Pin Controls\nEach GPIO pin can has a input disable and a pulldown disable. By default, the GPIO pin input paths are \nenabled and the internal pulldown circuit in the GPIO is enabled. The GPIO_INPUT_CTL register 0x0F \nand GPIO_PD_CTL register 0xBE allow control of the input enable and the pulldown respectively. For most \napplications, there is no need to modify the default register settings.\n7.4.14 Line Valid and Frame Valid Indicators\nThe FrameValid (FV) and LineValid (LV) indications from the Receive Port indicate approximate frame and line \nboundaries at the FPD-Link III Receiver input. These signals may not be accurate if the receiver is in CSI-2 input \nmode and multiple video streams are present at the Receive Port input. A common example of this scenario \nwould be multiple Virtual Channel IDs received on a single port.\nWhen the receiver is in one of the Raw modes the LV and FV provides controls for the video framing. The FV is \nequivalent to a Vertical Sync (VSYNC) while the LineValid is equivalent to a Horizontal Sync (HSYNC) input to \nthe DS90UB933A-Q1 and DS90UB913A-Q1 device (see Section 7.4.27 ).\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  allows setting the polarity of these signals by register programming. The FV and LV polarity \nare controlled on a per-port basis and can be independently set in the PORT_CONFIG2 register 0x7C.\nTo prevent false detection of FrameValid, FV must be asserted for a minimum number of clocks prior to first \nvideo line to be considered valid. The minimum FrameValid time is programmable in the FV_MIN_TIME register \n0xBC. Because the measurement is in FPD-Link III clocks, the minimum FrameValid setup to LineValid timing at \nthe Serializer will vary based on the RAW input operating mode.\nA minimum FV to LV timing is required when processing RAW video frames at the serializer input. If the FV \nto LV minimum setup is not met (by default), the first video line is discarded. Optionally, a register control \n(PORT_CONFIG:DISCARD_1ST_ON_ERR) forwards the first video line missing some number of pixels at the \nstart of the line.\nFV\nLVTFV_LV\n§\nFigure 7-7.

The value of the data type is contained in the six LSBs of the data identifier byte. \nWhen partnered with a DS90UB953-Q1 or  DS90UB935-Q1  serializer, the Data Type is passed through from the \nreceived CSI-2 packets. When partnered with DS90UB933-Q1 or DS90UB913A-Q1 the received RAW mode \ndata is converted to CSI-2 Tx packets with assigned data type and virtual channel ID and matches what is sent \nby the video source.\nDVP format serializer inputs must have discrete synch signals. When interfacing with DS90UB913A-Q1 or \nDS90UB933-Q1  serializers, the DS90UB954-Q1  utilizes the HSYNC and VSYNC inputs to construct the MIPI \nCSI-2 Tx data packets. When paired with a DVP serializer, the DS90UB954-Q1 deserializer supports RAW8, \nRAW10 or RAW12 as well as formats which have the same pixel packing as RAW8, RAW10 or RAW12 such as \nYUV-422.\nFor each RX Port, registers define with which virtual channel and data type the RAW data context is associated:\n•For FPD Receiver port operating in RAW input mode connected to a DS90UB933-Q1 or DS90UB913A-Q1 \nserializer, register 0x70 (see Table 7-122 ) describes RAW10 Mode and 0x71 (see Table 7-123 ) RAW12 \nMode.\n•RAW1x_VC[7:6] field defines the associated virtual ID transported by the CSI-2 protocol from the sensor.\n•RAW1x_ID[5:0] field defines the associated data type.

CSI-2 Data Identifier Structure\n7.4.19 Virtual Channel and Context\nThe CSI-2 protocol layer transports virtual channels. The purpose of virtual channels is to separate different data \nflows interleaved in the same data stream. Each virtual channel is identified by a unique channel identification \nnumber in the packet header. Therefore, a CSI-2 TX context can be associated with a virtual channel and a data \ntype. Virtual channels are defined by a 2-bit field. This channel identification number is encoded in the 2-bit code.\nThe CSI-2 TX transmits the channel identifier number and multiplexes the interleaved data streams. The CSI-2 \nTX supports up to four concurrent virtual channels.\n7.4.20 CSI-2 Input Mode Virtual Channel Mapping\nThe CSI-2 Input mode (see Section 7.4.1 ) provides per-port Virtual Channel ID mapping. For each FPD-Link \nIII input port, separate mapping may be done for each input VC-ID to any of four VC-ID values. The mapping \nis controlled by the VC_ID_MAP register 0x72 (see Table 7-124 ). This function sends the output as a time-\nmultiplexed CSI-2 stream, where the video sources are differentiated by the virtual channel. The equivalent \nregisters 0x70-0x71 can be used for mapping VC-IDs when operating in RAW FPD-Link III mode connected to \nDS90UB9x3x-Q1.\n7.4.20.1 Example 1\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  is capable of receiving data from sensors attached to each port. Each port is sending a \nvideo stream using VC-ID of 0. The DS90UB954-Q1  can be configured to re-map the incoming VC-IDs to ensure \neach video stream has a unique ID. The direct implementation would map incoming VC-ID of 0 for RX Port 0, \nand VC-ID of 1 for RX Port 1.\nSensor A\nVC-ID = 0DS90UB954\nCSI TXSensor B\nVC-ID = 0VC-ID = 0 Port 0\nCSI2 RX\nPort 1\nCSI2 RXVC-ID = 1VC-ID = 1\nFigure 7-12.

Receive Port 0 maps the VC-IDs directly without change. Receive Port 1 \nmaps the VC-IDs 0 and 1 to VC-IDs 2 and 3.

This operation is \ncontrolled through the CSI_PLL_CTL 0x1F register (see Table 7-50 ). The actual CSI-2 rate is proportional to the \nREFCLK frequency.\nTable 7-13.

When operating \nwith a single RX port, the net CSI-2 video bandwidth can be up to 3.328 Gbps .\nTo operate CSI-2 at speed of 400-Mbps mode, set CSI_PLL_CTL to 11b (0x1F[1:0] =11) to enable 400-Mbps \noperation for the CSI-2 Transmitters. Internal PLL and Timers are then automatically adjusted for the reduced \nreference clock frequency. Software control of CSI-2 Transmitter timing registers is required to provide proper \ninterface timing on the CSI-2 Output. The following are the recommended timer settings for 400-Mbps operation.\n# Set CSI-2 Timing parameters\nWriteI2C(0xB0,0x2)    # set auto-increment, page 0\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x40)   # CSI-2 Port 0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x83)   # TCK Prep\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x8D)   # TCK Zero\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x87)   # TCK Trail\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x87)   # TCK Post\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x83)   # THS Prep\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x86)   # THS Zero\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x84)   # THS Trail\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x86)   # THS Exit\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x84)   # TLPX\n7.4.22 CSI-2 Replicate Mode\nIn CSI-2 Replicate mode, both ports can be programmed to output the same data. The output from CSI-2 port 0 \nis also presented on CSI-2 port 1.\nTo configure this mode of operation, set the CSI_REPLICATE bit in the FWD_CTL2 register (Address 0x21 in \nTable 7-52 ). Enabling replicate mode will automatically enable the second CSI-2 Clock output signal. The CSI-2 \ntransmitter must be programmed for one or two lanes only through the CSI_LANE_COUNT field in the CSI_CTL \nregister as only one or two lanes are supported.\n7.4.23 CSI-2 Transmitter Output Control\nTwo register bits allow controlling the CSI-2 Transmitter output state. If the OUTPUT_SLEEP_STATE_SELECT \n(OSS_SEL) control is set to 0 in the GENERAL_CFG 0x02 register (see Table 7-21 ), the CSI-2 Transmitter \noutputs are forced to the HS-0 state. If the OUTPUT_ENABLE (OEN) register bit is set to 0 in the \nGENERAL_CFG register, the CSI-2 pins are set to the high-impedance state.\nFor normal operation (OSS_SEL and OEN both set to 1), activity on either of the Rx Port determines the \nstate of the CSI-2 outputs. The CSI-2 Pin State during FPD-Link III inactive includes two options, controlled DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n44 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nby the OUTPUT_EN_MODE bit in the GENERAL_CFG register and FWD_PORTx_DIS in the FWD_CTL1 \nregister 0x20. If OUTPUT_EN_MODE is set to 0, a lack of activity will force the outputs to Hi-Z condition. If \nOUTPUT_EN_MODE is set to 1, or if the forwarding for the Rx Port is disabled (FWD_PORTx_DIS = 1), the \noutput enters LP-11 state as there is no data available to the CSI-2 Transmitter input. The FPD-Link III inputs \nare considered active if the Receiver indicates valid lock to the incoming signal. For a CSI-2 TX port, lock is \nconsidered valid if any Received port mapped to the TX port is indicating Lock. See section Section 7.4.6  for \ndescription of Rx port forwarding.\nTable 7-14.

The TX_PORT_PASS 0x35[0] indicates valid CSI-2 data \nbeing presented on CSI-2 port. If no data is being forwarded or if error conditions have been detected on the \nvideo data, the CSI-2 Pass signal will be cleared. The TX_PORT_SYNC 0x35[0] indicates the CSI-2 Tx port is \nable to properly synchronize input data streams from multiple sources. TX_PORT_SYNC will always return 0 \nif Synchronized Forwarding is disabled. Interrupts may also be generated based on changes in the CSI-2 port \nstatus.\n7.4.25 Video Buffers\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  implements two video line buffer and FIFO, one for each RX channel. The video buffers \nprovide storage of data payload and forward requirements for sending multiple video streams on the CSI-2 \ntransmit ports. The total line buffer memory size is a 16-kB block for each RX port.\nThe CSI-2 transmitter waits for an entire packet to be available before pulling data from the video buffers.\n7.4.26 CSI-2 Line Count and Line Length\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  counts the number of received lines (long packets) to determine line count on \nLINE_COUNT_1 and LINE_COUNT_0 registers 0x73–74. For received line length, DS90UB954-Q1  reads the \nnumber of bytes per line in LINE_LEN_1 and LINE_LEN_0 registers 0x75–0x76. Line Count and Line Length \nvalues are valid when receiving a single video stream. If multiple virtual channels are received on a FPD-Link III \nReceive port in CSI-2 input mode, the values in registers 0x73-74 may not be accurate\n7.4.27 FrameSync Operation\nA frame synchronization signal (FrameSync) can be sent through the back channel using any of the back \nchannel GPIOs. The signal can be generated in two different methods. The first option offers sending the \nexternal FrameSync using one of the available GPIO pins on the DS90UB954-Q1  and mapping that GPIO to a \nback channel GPIO on one or two of the FPD-Link III ports.\nThe second option is to have the DS90UB954-Q1  internally generate a FrameSync signal to send through the \nback channel GPIO to one or two of the attached Serializers.\nFrameSync signaling is synchronous on each of the two back channels. Thus, the FrameSync signal arrives at \nboth of the serializers with limited skew.\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 45\n7.4.27.1 External FrameSync Control\nIn External FrameSync mode, an external signal is input to the DS90UB954-Q1  through one of the GPIO pins \non the device. The external FrameSync signal may be propagated to one or more of the attached FPD-Link III \nSerializers through a GPIO signal in the back channel. The expected skew timing for external FrameSynch mode \nis on the order of one back channel frame period or 600 ns when operating at 50 Mbps.\n954 Deserializer\nBC_GPIOxBC_GPIOxSerializerGPIOx\nSerializerGPIOxFPD-Link III\nFPD-Link III\nGPIOy\nExternal \nFrame Synch\nFigure 7-17.

The resolution of the FrameSync generator clock (FS_CLK_PD) is derived from the back channel \nframe period (see BC_FREQ_SELECT[2:0] in Table 7-98 ). For example, each 50-Mbps back channel operation, \nthe frame period is 600 ns (30 bits × 20 ns/bit), and for 2.5-Mbps back channel operation , the frame period is 12 \nµs (30 bits × 400 ns/bit).\nOnce enabled, the FrameSync signal is sent continuously based on the programmed conditions.\nEnabling the internal FrameSync mode is done by setting the FS_GEN_ENABLE control in the FS_CTL register \nto a value of 1. The FS_MODE field controls the clock source used for the FrameSync generation. The \nFS_GEN_MODE field configures whether the duty cycle of the FrameSync is 50/50 or whether the high and low \nperiods are controlled separately. The FrameSync high and low periods are controlled by the FS_HIGH_TIME \nand FS_LOW_TIME registers.\nThe accuracy of the internally generated FrameSync is directly dependent on the accuracy of the 25-MHz \noscillator used as the reference clock and timing values should be scaled if reference other than 25 MHz is used.\n954 Deserializer\nBC_GPIOxBC_GPIOxSerializerGPIOx\nSerializerGPIOxFPD-Link III\nFPD-Link III\nFrameSync\nGenerator\nFigure 7-19.

Mode settings:\n•Programmable High/Low periods: FS_GEN_MODE 0x18[1]=0\n•Use port 0 back channel frame period: FS_MODE 0x18[7:4]=0x0\n•Back channel rate of 50 Mbps: BC_FREQ_SELECT for port 0 0x58[2:0]=110b\n•Initial FS state of 0: FS_INIT_STATE 0x18[2]=0\nBased on mode settings, the FrameSync is generated based upon FS_CLK_PD of 600 ns.\nThe total period of the FrameSync is (1 / 60 hz) / 600 ns or approximately 27778 counts. The high time is \nprogrammed to 2778 and the low time is programmed to 25000.\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 47\nFor a 10% duty cycle, set the high time to 2777 (0x0AD9) cycles, and the low time to 24999 (0x61A7) cycles:\n•FS_HIGH_TIME_1: 0x19=0x0A\n•FS_HIGH_TIME_0: 0x1A=0xD9\n•FS_LOW_TIME_1: 0x1B=0x61\n•FS_LOW_TIME_0: 0x1C=0xA7\n7.4.27.2.1 Code Example for Internally Generated FrameSync\nWriteI2C(0x4C,0x01) # RX0\nWriteI2C(0x6E,0xAA) # BC_GPIO_CTL0: FrameSync signal to GPIO0/1\nWriteI2C(0x4C,0x12) # RX1\nWriteI2C(0x6E,0xAA) # BC_GPIO_CTL0: FrameSync signal to GPIO0/1\nWriteI2C(0x10,0x91A) # FrameSync signal; Device Status; Enabled\nWriteI2C(0x19,0x0A) # FS_HIGH_TIME_1\nWriteI2C(0x1A,0xD9) # FS_HIGH_TIME_0\nWriteI2C(0x1B,0x61) # FS_LOW_TIME_1\nWriteI2C(0x1C,0xA7) # FS_LOW_TIME_0\nWriteI2C(0x18,0x01) # Enable FrameSync\n7.4.28 CSI-2 Forwarding\nVideo stream forwarding is handled by the forwarding control in the DS90UB954-Q1  on FWD_CTL1 register \n0x20. The forwarding control pulls data from the video buffers for each FPD-Link III RX port and forwards the \ndata to the CSI-2 output interfaces. It also handles generation of transitions between LP and HS modes as well \nas sending of Synchronization frames. The forwarding control monitors each of the video buffers for packet and \ndata availability.\nForwarding from input ports may be disabled using per-port controls. Each of the forwarding engines may be \nconfigured to pull data from either of the two video buffers, although both buffer may only be assigned to one \nCSI-2 Transmitter at a time unless in replicate mode. The two forwarding engines operate independently.\n7.4.28.1 Enabling and Disabling the CSI-2 Transmitter\nWhen CSI-2 Transmitter is enabled in CSI_CTL register bit 0x33[0], by default the output will transition to LP11 \nstate. Once enabled, it is typically best to leave the CSI-2 Transmitter enable, and only change the forwarding \ncontrols if changes are required to the system. When enabling and disabling the CSI-2 Transmitter, forwarding \nshould be disabled to ensure proper start and stop of the CSI Transmitter.\nWhen enabling and disabling the CSI-2 Transmitter, use the following sequence:\nTo Disable:\n1.Disable forwarding for assigned ports in the FWD_CTL1 register.\n2.Disable CSI periodic calibration (if enabled) in the CSI_ CTL2 register.\n3.Disable continuous clock operation (if enabled) in the CSI_ CTL register.\n4.Clear CSI Transmit enable in CSI_ CTL register.\nTo Enable:\n1.Set CSI Transmit enable (and continuous clock if desired) in CSI_ CTL register.\n2.Enable CSI periodic calibration (if desired) in the CSI_CTL2 register.\n3.Enable forwarding for assigned ports in the FWD_CTL1 register.\n7.4.28.2 Best-Effort Round Robin CSI-2 Forwarding\nBest-Effort Round Robin (RR) CSI-2 Forwarding allows for combining sensor sources with different resolutions \nand timing to the same CSI-2 Tx output. By default, the RR forwarding of packets use standard CSI-2 method of \nvideo stream determination. No special ordering of CSI-2 packets are specified, effectively relying on the Virtual \nChannel Identifier (VC) and Data Type (DT) fields to distinguish video streams. Each image sensor is assigned a \nVC-ID to identify the source. Different data types within a virtual channel are also supported in this mode.\nWhen receiving FPD-Link RAW packets from DS90UB9x3x-Q1, each image sensor is assigned a VC-ID to \nidentify the source. Different data types within a virtual channel is also supported in this mode.DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n48 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nThe forwarding engine forwards packets as they become available to the forwarding engine. In the case where \nmultiple packets may be available to transmit, the forwarding engine typically operates in an RR fashion based \non the input port from which the packets are received.\nBest-effort CSI-2 RR forwarding has the following characteristics and capabilities:\n•Uses Virtual Channel ID to differentiate each video stream\n•Separate Frame Synchronization packets for each VC\n•No synchronization requirements\nThis mode of operation allows input RX ports to have different video characteristics and there is no requirement \nthat the video be synchronized between ports. The attached video processor would be required to properly \ndecode the various video streams based on the VC and DT fields.\nBest-effort forwarding is enabled by setting the CSIx_RR_FWD bits in the FWD_CTL2 register 0x21.\n7.4.28.3 Synchronized Forwarding\nIn cases with multiple input sources, synchronized forwarding offers synchronization of all incoming data stored \nwithin the buffer. If packets arrive within a certain window, the forwarding control may be programmed to attempt \nto synchronize the video buffer data. In this mode, it attempts to send each channel synchronization packets in \norder (VC0, VC1) as well as sending packet data in the same order. In the following sections, Sensor A (SA) \nand Sensor B (SB) refer to the sensors connected at FPD-Link III RX port 0, and RX port 1, respectively. The \nfollowing describe only the 2-port operation, but single port configuration also can be applied.\nThe forwarding engine for the CSI-2 Transmitter can be configured to synchronize both video sources.\nRequirements:\n•Video arriving at input ports should be synchronized within approximately one video line period\n•All enabled ports should have valid, synchronized video\n•Each port must have identical video parameters, including number and size of video lines, presence of \nsynchronization packets, and so forth.\nThe forwarding engine attempts to send the video synchronized. If synchronization fails, the CSI-2 transmitter \nstops forwarding packets and attempt to restart sending synchronized video at the next FrameStart indication. \nPackets are discarded as long as the forwarding engine is unable to send the synchronized video.\nStatus is provided to indicate when the forwarding engine is synchronized. In addition, a flag is used to indicate \nthat synchronization has been lost (status is cleared on a read).\nThree options are available for Synchronized forwarding:\n•Basic Synchronized forwarding\n•Line-Interleave forwarding\n•Line-Concatenated forwarding\nSynchronized forwarding modes are selected by setting the CSIx_SYNC_FWD controls in the FWD_CTL2 \nregister. To enable synchronized forwarding the following order of operations is recommended:\n1.Disable Best-effort forwarding by clearing the CSIx_RR_FWD bits in the FWD_CTL2 register\n2.Enable forwarding per Receive port by clearing the FWD_PORTx_DIS bits in the FWD_CTL1 register\n3.Enable Synchronized forwarding in the FWD_CTL2 register\n7.4.28.4 Basic Synchronized Forwarding\nDuring Basic Synchronized Forwarding, each forwarded frame is an independent CSI-2 video frame including \nFrameStart (FS), video lines, and FrameEnd (FE) packets. Each forwarded stream may have a unique VC \nID. If the forwarded streams do not have a unique VC-ID, the receiving process may use the frame order to \ndifferentiate the video stream packets.\nThe forwarding engine attempts to send the video synchronized. If synchronization fails, the CSI-2 transmitter \nstops forwarding packets and attempts to restart sending synchronized video at the next FS indication. Packets \nare discarded as long as the forwarding engine is unable to send the synchronized video.\nExample Synchronized traffic to CSI-2 Transmit port at start of frame:\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 49\nFS_A – FS_B – SA_L1 – SB_L1 SA_L2 – SB_L2 – SA_L3 …\nExample Synchronized traffic to CSI-2 Transmit port at end of frame:\n...

For example, if forwarding from both input ports, only one FS and FE packet is sent \nfor each video frame. The synchronization packets for the other port is dropped. The video line packets for each \nvideo stream are sent as individual packets. This effectively merges the frames from N video sources into a \nsingle frame that has N times the number of video lines.\nIn this mode, all video streams must also have the same VC, although this is not checked by the forwarding \nengine. This is useful when connected to a controller that does not support multiple VCs. The receiving \nprocessor must process the image based on order of video line reception.\nExample Synchronized traffic to CSI-2 Transmit port at start of frame:\nFS_A – SA_L1 – SB_L1 – SA_L2 – SB_L2 – SA_L3 …\nExample Synchronized traffic to CSI-2 Transmit port at end of frame:\n...

For example, if forwarding from both \ninput ports, only one FS an FE packet is sent for each video frame. The synchronization packets for the other \nport is dropped.

The I2C is for local device configuration \nand incorporates a Bidirectional Control Channel (BCC) that allows communication across the FPD-Link cable \nwith remote serializers as well as remote I2C target devices. The DS90UB954-Q1  implements an I2C compatible \ntarget capable of operation compliant to the Standard, Fast, and Fast-plus modes of operation. This allows I2C \noperation at up to 1-MHz clock frequencies. When paired with a DS90UB935-Q1  or DS90UB953-Q1  serializer \nthe DS90UB954-Q1  supports combined format I2C read and write access. When paired with the DS90UB933-\nQ1 or DS90UB913A-Q1 serializers, all I2C remote writes must be terminated with a STOP rather than repeated \nSTART. The timing for the I2C interface is detailed in Figure 6-4 .\nFor accesses to local registers, the I2C Target operates without stretching the clock. Accesses to remote devices \nover the Bidirectional Control Channel results in clock stretching to allow for response time across the link. \nThe DS90UB954-Q1  can also act as I2C Controller for regenerating Bidirectional Control Channel accesses \noriginating from the remote devices across FPD-Link. Set I2C_CONTROLLER_EN in register 0x02[5] = 1 to \nenable the proxy controller functionality of the deserializer.\n7.5.1.1 Bidirectional Control\nThe Bidirectional Control Channel (BCC) supports higher frequency operation when attached to the \nDS90UB935-Q1  or DS90UB953-Q1  and is also backward compatible with the DS90UB933-Q1 or DS90UB913A-\nQ1 serializers. The Bidirectional Control Channel is compatible with I2C devices, allowing local I2C target \naccess to device registers as well as bidirectional I2C operation across the link to the Serializer and attached \ndevices. I2C access should not be attempted across the link when Rx Port Lock status is Low. In addition to \nproviding BCC operation, the back channel signaling also supports GPIO operations and advertising device \ncapabilities to the attached Serializer device. The default back channel frequency is selected by the strap setting \nof the MODE pin. Additional speeds are also available, controlled separately for each Rx Port through the \nBC_FREQ_SELECT register field in the BCC_CONFIG register 0x58. Back channel frequency operates in 50-\nMbps and 2.5-Mbps modes to support DS90UB935-Q1,  DS90UB953-Q1  and DS90UB933-Q1 or DS90UB913A-\nQ1 Serializers.\n7.5.1.2 Device Address\nThe primary device address is set through a resistor divider (R HIGH and R LOW — see Figure 7-24  below) \nconnected to the IDX pin. Note that the voltage of V I2C must match the voltage of V VDDIO . The DS90UB954-\nQ1 waits 1 ms after PDB goes high to allow time for power supply transients before sampling the IDX value and \nconfiguring the device to set the I2C address. The primary I2C target address is stored in the I2C Device ID \nregister at address 0x0. In addition to the primary I2C target address, the DS90UB954-Q1  may be programmed \nto respond to up to 2 other I2C addresses. The two RX Port ID addresses provide direct access to the Receive \nPort 0 and Por1 registers without needing to set the paging controls normally required to access the port \nregisters. In addition, these Rx port assigned I2C IDs also allow access to the shared registers in the same \nmanner as the primary I2C target address. The I2C_RX0_ID and I2C_RX1_ID, registers are located in register \naddress 0xF8 and 0xF9, respectively.\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 55\nHOST Deserializer\nSCL\nSDARPU RPURHIGH\nRLOW\nSCL\nSDA\nTo other DevicesIDXVDD18\nVI2CVI2CFigure 7-24.

SCL is a Serial Bus Clock Input. SDA is the \nSerial Bus Data Input / Output signal. Both SCL and SDA signals require an external pullup resistor to 1.8-V or \n3.3-V nominal V I2C. For most applications, TI recommends a 4.7-k Ω pullup resistor to V I2C. However, the pullup \nresistor value may be adjusted for capacitive loading and data rate requirements. The signals are either pulled \nHigh or driven Low.\nThe Serial Bus protocol is controlled by START, START-Repeated, and STOP phases. A START occurs when \nSCL transitions Low while SDA is High. A STOP occurs when SDA transitions High while SCL is also HIGH. See \nFigure 7-25 .DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n56 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nSDA\nSCL\nS P\nSTART condition, or\nSTART repeat conditionSTOP conditionFigure 7-25. START and STOP Conditions\nTo communicate with a target device, the host controller (controller) sends the target address and listens for a \nresponse from the target. This response is referred to as an acknowledge bit (ACK). If a target on the bus is \naddressed correctly, it acknowledges (ACKs) the controller by driving the SDA bus low. If the address does not \nmatch the target address of the device, it not-acknowledges (NACKs) the controller by letting SDA be pulled \nHigh. ACKs also occur on the bus when data is being transmitted. When the controller is writing data, the \ntarget ACKs after every data byte is successfully received. When the controller is reading data, the controller \nACKs after every data byte is received to let the target know it wants to receive another data byte. When the \ncontroller wants to stop reading, it NACKs after the last data byte and creates a stop condition on the bus. All \ncommunication on the bus begins with either a Start condition or a Repeated Start condition. All communication \non the bus ends with a Stop condition.

Local I2C \nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 57\ntransactions to access DS90UB954-Q1  registers can be conducted 2 ms after power supplies are stable and \nPDB is brought high. For accesses to local registers, the I2C Target operates without stretching the clock. The \nprimary I2C target address is set through the IDx pin. The primary I2C target address is stored in the I2C \nDevice ID register at address 0x0. In addition to the primary I2C target address, the DS90UB954-Q1  may be \nprogrammed to respond to up to two other I2C addresses. The two RX Port ID addresses provide direct access \nto the Receive Port registers without needing to set the paging controls normally required to access the port \nregisters.\n7.5.3 Remote Target Operation\nThe Bidirectional control channel provides a mechanism to read or write I2C registers in remote devices over the \nFPD-Link III interface. The I2C Controller located at the Deserializer must support I2C clock stretching. Accesses \nto serializer or remote target devices over the Bidirectional Control Channel will result in clock stretching to allow \nfor response time across the link. The DS90UB954-Q1  acts as an I2C target on the local bus, forwards read and \nwrite requests to the remote device, and returns the response from the remote device to the local I2C bus. To \nallow for the propagation and regeneration of the I2C transaction at the remote device, the DS90UB954-Q1  will \nstretch the I2C clock while waiting for the remote response. To communicate with a remote target device, the Rx \nPort which is intended for messaging also must be selected in register 0x4C. The I2C address of the currently \nselected RX Port serializer will be populated in register 0x5B of the DS90UB954-Q1 . The BCC_CONFIG register \n0x58 also must have bit 6, I2C_PASS_THROUGH set to one. If enabled, local I2C transactions with valid \naddress decode will then be forwarded through the Bidirectional Control Channel to the remote I2C bus. When \nI2C PASS THROUGH is set, the deserializer will only propagate messages that it recognizes, such as the \nregistered serializer alias address (SER ALIAS), or any registered remote target alias attached to the serializer \nI2C bus (TARGET ALIAS) assigned to the specific Rx Port0 or Port 1. Setting PASS THROUGH ALL and AUTO \nACK are less common use cases and primarily used for debugging I2C messaging as they will respectively pass \nall addresses regardless of valid I2C address (PASS_THROUGH_ALL) and acknowledge all I2C commands \nwithout waiting for a response from serializer (AUTO_ACK).\n7.5.3.1 Remote I2C Targets Data Throughput\nSince the BCC buffers each I2C data byte and regenerates the I2C protocol on the remote side of the link, the \noverall I2C throughput will be reduced. The reduction is dependent on the operating frequencies of the local and \nremote interfaces. The local I2C rate is based on the host controller clock rate, while the remote rate depends on \nthe settings for the proxy I2C controller (SCL frequency).\nFor purposes of understanding the effects of the BCC on data throughput from a host controller to a remote I2C \ncontroller, the approximate bit rate including latency timings across the control channel can be calculated by the \nfollowing:\n9 bits / ((Host_bit * 9) + (Remote_bit * 9) + FCdelay + BCCdelay)\nExample of DS90UB953/954  chipset:\nFor the 100 kbit/s (100 kHz) :\nHost_bit = 10us (100 kHz)\nRemote_bit = 13.5us (default 74 kHz)\nFCdelay = 225ns (typical value)\nBCCdelay = 1.5us (typical value for 50 Mbps back channel rate)\nEffective rate = 9bits / (90us + 121us + 0.225us + 1.5us) = 42.3 kbit/s\nTable 7-16. Typical Achievable Bit Rates\nHost I2C rate Remote I2C rate Net bit rate\n100 kbit/s 74 kbit/s (default settings) 42.3 kbit/s\n400 kbit/s 100 kbit/s 78.8 kbit/s\n1 Mbit/s 100 kbit/s 89.4 kbit/s\n1 Mbit/s 400 kbit/s 270.88 kbit/sDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n58 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nTable 7-16. Typical Achievable Bit Rates (continued)\nHost I2C rate Remote I2C rate Net bit rate\n1 Mbit/s 1 Mbit/s 456.27 kbit/s\nSince the I2C protocol includes overhead for sending address information as well as START and STOP bits, the \nactual data throughput depends on the size and type of transactions used. Use of large bursts to read and write \ndata will result in higher data transfer rates.\n7.5.4 Remote Target Addressing\nVarious system use cases require multiple sensor devices with the same fixed I2C target address to be remotely \naccessible from the same I2C bus at the deserialilzer. The DS90UB954-Q1  provides target ID virtual addressing \nto differentiate target target addresses when connecting two or more remote devices. Eight pairs of TargetAlias \nand TargetID registers are allocated for each FPD-Link III Receive port in registers 0x5C through 0x6C. The \nTargetAlias register allows programming a virtual address which the host controller uses to access the remote \ndevice. The TargetID register provides the actual target address for the device on the remote I2C bus. Since \neight pairs of registers are available for each port (total of 16 pairs), multiple devices may be directly accessible \nremotely without need for reprogramming. Multiple TargetAlias can be assigned to the same TargetID as well.\n7.5.5 Broadcast Write to Remote Target Devices\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  provides a mechanism to broadcast I2C writes to remote devices (either remote targets \nor serializers). For each Receive port, the TargetID and TargetAlias register pairs would be programmed with \nthe same TargetAlias value so they would each respond to the local I2C access. The TargetID value would \nmatch the intended remote device address, either remote target or serializers. For each receive port, on of the \nTargetAlias registers is set with an Alias value. For each port, the TargetID value is set to the address of the \nremote device. These values may be the same. To access the remote serializer registers rather than a remote \ntarget, the serializer ID (SER_IDX or SER_IDY) would be used as the TargetID value.\n7.5.5.1 Code Example for Broadcast Write\n#  "FPD3_PORT_SEL Boardcast RX0/1"\nWriteI2C(0x4c,0x0f) # RX_PORT0 read; RX0/1 write\n#  "enable pass through"\nWriteI2C(0x58,0x58) # enable pass through\nWriteI2C(0x5c,0x18) # "SER_ALIAS_ID"\nWriteI2C(0x5d,0x60) # "TargetID[0]"\nWriteI2C(0x65,0x60) # "TargetAlias[0]"\nWriteI2C(0x7c,0x01) # "FV_POLARITY"\nWriteI2C(0x70,0x1f) # RAW10_datatype_yuv422b10_VC0\n7.5.6 I2C Controller Proxy\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  implements an I2C controller that acts as a proxy controller to regenerate I2C accesses \noriginating from a remote serializer (DS90UB935-Q1, DS90UB933-Q1, DS90UB913A-Q1 , or the DS90UB953-\nQ1). By default, the I2C Controller Enable bit (I2C_CONTROLLER_EN) in register 0x05[2]= 0 to block Controller \naccess to local deserialilzer I2C from remote serializers. Set I2C_CONTROLLER_EN] = 1 if system requires the \ndeserializer to act as proxy controller for remote serializers on the local deserializer I2C bus. The proxy controller \nis an I2C compatible controller, capable of operating with Standard-mode, Fast-mode, or Fast-mode Plus I2C \ntiming. It is also capable of arbitration with other controllers, allowing multiple controllers and targets to exist on \nthe I2C bus. A separate I2C proxy controller is implemented for each Receive port. This allows independent \noperation for all sources to the I2C interface. Arbitration between multiple sources is handled automatically using \nI2C multi-controller arbitration.\n7.5.7 I2C Controller Proxy Timing\nThe proxy controller timing parameters are based on the REFCLK timing. Timing accuracy for the I2C proxy \ncontroller based on the REFCLK or XTL clock source attached to the DS90UB954-Q1  deserializer. Before \nREFCLK is applied the deserializer will default to internal reference clock with accuracy of 25 MHz ±10%.The \nI2C Controller regenerates the I2C read or write access using timing controls in the registers 0xA and 0xB to \nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 59\nregenerate the clock and data signals to meet the desired I2C timing in standard, fast, or fast-plus modes of \noperation.\nI2C Controller SCL High Time is set in register 0x0A[7:0]. This field configures the high pulse width of the SCL \noutput when the Serializer is the Controller on the local deserializer I2C bus. The default value is set to provide \na minimum 5-µs SCL high time with the reference clock at 25 MHz + 100 ppm including four additional oscillator \nclock periods or synchronization and response time. Units are 40 ns for the nominal oscillator clock frequency, \ngiving Min_delay = 40 ns × (SCL_HIGH_TIME + 4).\nI2C Controller SCL Low Time is set in register 0x0B[7:0]. This field configures the low pulse width of the SCL \noutput when the Serializer is the Controller on the local deserializer I2C bus. This value is also used as the SDA \nsetup time by the I2C Target for providing data prior to releasing SCL during accesses over the BiDirectional \nControl Channel. The default value is set to provide a minimum 5-µs SCL high time with the reference clock at \n25 MHz + 100 ppm including four additional oscillator clock periods or synchronization and response time. Units \nare 40 ns for the nominal oscillator clock frequency, giving Min_delay = 40 ns × (SCL_HIGH_TIME + 4).

The main interrupt control registers provide control and status for interrupts \nfrom the individual sources. Sources include each of the two FPD-Link III Receive ports as well as the CSI-2 \nTransmit port. Clearing interrupt conditions requires reading the associated status register for the source. The \nsetting of the individual interrupt status bits is not dependent on the related interrupt enable controls. The \ninterrupt enable controls whether an interrupt is generated based on the condition, but does not prevent the \ninterrupt status assertion.\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  devices have built in flexibility such that the main interrupt may be brought to any GPIO pin \nthrough the GPIOx_PIN_CTL register for that pin (see Table 7-35 ). Note that the GPIO3 pin is the only GPIO \nthat is implemented as open-drain, so this is the preferred pin for signaling the interrupt.\nFor an interrupt to be generated based on one of the interrupt status assertions, both the individual interrupt \nenable and the INT_EN control must be set in the INTERRUPT_CTL 0x23 register. For example, to generate an \ninterrupt if IS_RX0 is set, both the IE_RX0 and INT_EN bits must be set. If IE_RX0 is set but INT_EN is not, \nthe INT status is indicated in the INTERRUPT_STS register, and the INTB pin does not indicate the interrupt \ncondition.\nSee the INTERRUPT_CTL 0x23 and INTERRUPT_STS 0x24 registers for details.\n7.5.8.1 Code Example to Enable Interrupts\n#  "RX0/1 INTERRUPT_CTL enable"\nWriteI2C(0x23,0xBF) # RX all & INTB PIN EN\n# Individual RX0/1 INTERRUPT_CTL enable\n# "RX0 INTERRUPT_CTL enable"\nWriteI2C(0x4C,0x01) # RX0\nWriteI2C(0x23,0x81) # RX0 & INTB PIN EN\n# "RX1 INTERRUPT_CTL enable"\nWriteI2C(0x4C,0x12) # RX1\nWriteI2C(0x23,0x82) # RX1 & INTB PIN EN\n7.5.8.2 FPD-Link III Receive Port Interrupts\nFor each FPD-Link III Receive port, multiple options are available for generating interrupts. Interrupt \ngeneration is controlled through the PORT_ICR_HI 0xD8 and PORT_ICR_LO 0xD9 registers. In addition, the \nPORT_ISR_HI 0xDA and PORT_ISR_LO 0xDB registers provide read-only status for the interrupts. Clearing of \ninterrupt conditions is handled by reading the RX_PORT_STS1, RX_PORT_STS2, and CSI_RX_STS registers. \nThe status bits in the PORT_ISR_HI/LO registers are copies of the associated bits in the main status registers.\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 61\nTo enable interrupts from one of the Receive port interrupt sources:\n1.Enable the interrupt source by setting the appropriate interrupt enable bit in the PORT_ICR_HI or \nPORT_ICR_LO register\n2.Set the RX Port X Interrupt control bit (IE_RXx) in the INTERRUPT_CTL register\n3.Set the INT_EN bit in the INTERRUPT_CTL register to allow the interrupt to assert the INTB pin low\nTo clear interrupts from one of the Receive port interrupt sources:\n1.(optional) Read the INTERRUPT_STS register to determine which RX Port caused the interrupt\n2.(optional) Read the PORT_ISR_HI and PORT_ISR_LO registers to determine source of interrupt\n3.Read the appropriate RX_PORT_STS1, RX_PORT_STS2, or CSI_RX_STS register to clear the interrupt.\nThe first two steps are optional. The interrupt could be determined and cleared by just reading the status \nregisters.\n7.5.8.2.1 Interrupts on Forward Channel GPIO\nWhen connected to the DS90UB935-Q1  or DS90UB953-Q1  serializer, interrupts can be generated on changes \nin any of the four forward channel GPIOs per port. Interrupts are enabled by setting bits in the FC_GPIO_ICR \nregister. Interrupts may be generated on rising and/or falling transitions on the GPIO signal. The GPIO interrupt \nstatus is cleared by reading the FC_GPIO_STS register.\nInterrupts should only be used for GPIO signals operating at less than 10 MHz. High or low pulses that are less \nthan 100 ns might not be detected at the DS90UB954-Q1 . To avoid false interrupt indications, the interrupts \nshould not be enabled until after the Forward Channel GPIOs are enabled at the serializer.\n7.5.8.2.2 Interrupts on Change in Sensor Status\nThe FPD-Link III Receiver recovers 32-bits of Sensor status from the attached DS90UB935-Q1  or DS90UB953-\nQ1 serializer. Interrupts may be generated based on changes in the Sensor Status values received from the \nforward channel. The Sensor Status consists of 4 bytes of data, which may be read from the SENSOR_STS_x \nregisters for each Receive port. Interrupts may be generated based on a change in any of the bits in the first byte \n(SENSOR_STS_0). Each bit can be individually masked for Rising and/or Falling interrupts.\nTwo registers control the interrupt masks for the SENSOR_STS bits: SEN_INT_RISE_CTL and \nSEN_INT_FALL_CTL.\nTwo registers provide interrupt status: SEN_INT_RISE_STS, SEN_INT_FALL_STS.\nIf a mask bit is set, a change in the associated SENSOR_STS_0 bit will be detected and latched in the \nSEN_INT_RISE_STS or SEN_INT_FALL_STS registers. If the mask bit is not set, the associated interrupt status \nbit will always be 0.

The \ninterrupt enable controls whether an interrupt is generated based on the condition, but does not prevent the \ninterrupt status assertion.\n7.5.9 Error Handling\nIn the DS90UB954-Q1  , the FPD-Link III receiver transfers incoming video frames to internal video buffers \nfor forwarding to the CSI-2 Transmit ports. When the DS90UB954-Q1  detects an error condition the standard \noperation would be to flag this error condition and truncate sending the CSI-2 frame to avoid sending corrupted \ndata downstream. When the DS90UB954-Q1  recovers from an error condition, it will provide Start of Frame \nand resume sending valid data. Consequently, when the downstream CSI-2 input receives a repeated Start \nof Frame condition, this will indicate that the data received in between the prior start of frame is suspect \nand the signal processor can then discard the suspected data. The settings in registers PORT_CONFIG2 \n(0x7C) and PORT_PASS_CTL (0x7D) can be used to change how the 954 handles errors when passing video \nframes. The receive ports may be configured to qualify the incoming video, providing a status indication and \npreventing forwarding of video frames until certain error free conditions are met. The Pass indication may be \nused to prevent forwarding packets to the internal video buffers by setting the PASS_DISCARD_EN bit in the \nPORT_PASS_CTL register. When this bit is set, video input will be discarded until the Pass signal indicates valid \nreceive data. The Receive port will indicate Pass status once specific conditions are met including a number of \nvalid frames received. Valid frames may include requiring no FPD-Link III Parity errors and consistent frame size \nincluding video line length and/or number of video lines.\nIn addition, the Receive port may be programmed to truncate video frames containing errors or prevent the \nforwarding of video until the Pass conditions are met. Register settings in PORT_CONFIG2 register 0x7C \ncan be used to truncate frames on different line/frame sizes or a CSI-2 parity error is detected. When the \ndeserializer truncates frames in cases of different line/frame sizes different line/frame sizes, the video frame will \nstop immediately with no frame end packet. Often the condition will not be cleared until the next valid frame is \nreceived.\nThe Rx Port PASS indication may be used to prevent forwarding packets to the internal video buffers by setting \nthe PASS_DISCARD_EN bit in the PORT_PASS_CTL register 0x7D. When this bit is set, video input will be \ndiscarded until the Pass signal indicates valid receive data. The incoming video frames may be truncated based \non error conditions or change in video line size or number of lines. These functions are controlled by bits in the \nPORT_CONFIG2 register. When truncating video frames, the video frame may be truncated after sending any \nnumber of video lines. A truncated frame will not send a Frame End packet to the CSI-2 Transmit port.\n7.5.9.1 Receive Frame Threshold\nThe FPD-Link III Receiver may be programmed to require a specified number of valid video frames prior \nto indicating a Pass condition and forwarding video frames. The number of required valid video frames is \nprogrammable through the PASS_THRESH field in the PORT_PASS_CTL register 0x7D ( Table 7-135 ). The \nthreshold can be programmed from 0 to 3 video frames. If set to 0, Pass will typically be indicated as soon as \nthe FPD-Link III Receiver reports Lock to the incoming signal. If set greater than 0, the Receiver will require \nthat number of valid frames before indicating Pass. Determination of valid frames will be dependent on the \ncontrol bits in the PORT_PASS_CTL register. In the case of a Parity Error, when PASS_PARITY_ERR is set to 1 \nforwarding will be enabled one frame early. To ensure at least one good frame occurs following a parity error the \ncounter should be set to 2 or higher when PASS_PARITY_ERR = 1.\n7.5.9.2 Port PASS Control\nWhen the PASS_LINE_SIZE control is set in the PORT_PASS_CTL register, the Receiver will qualify received \nframes based on having a consistent video line size. For PASS_LINE_SIZE to be clear, the deserializer checks \nthat the received line length remains consistent during the frame and between frames. For each video line, the \nlength (in bytes) will be determined. If it varies then we will flag this condition. Each video line in the packet must \nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 65\nbe the same size, and the line size must be consistent across video frames. A change in video line size will \nrestart the valid frame counter.\nWhen the PASS_LINE_CNT control is set in the PORT_PASS_CTL register, the Receiver will qualify received \nframes based on having a consistent frame size in number of lines. A change in number of video lines will restart \nthe valid frame counter.\nWhen the PASS_PARITY_ERR control is set in the PORT_PASS_CTL register, the Receiver will clear the Pass \nindication on receipt of a parity error on the FPD-Link III interface. The valid frame counter will also be cleared on \nthe parity error event. When PASS_PARITY_ERR is set to 1, TI also recommends setting PASS_THRESHOLD \nto 2 or higher to ensure at least one good frame occurs following a parity error.\n7.5.10 Timestamp – Video Skew Detection\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  implements logic to detect skew between video signaling from attached Sensors. For \neach input port, the DS90UB954-Q1  provides the ability to capture a timestamp for both a start-of-frame and \nstart-of-line event. Comparison of timestamps can provide information on the relative skew between the ports. \nStart-of-frame timestamps are generated at the active edge of the Vertical Sync signal in Raw mode. Start-of-line \ntimestamps are generated at the start of reception of the Nth line of video data after the start-of-frame for either \nmode of operation. The function does not use the Line Start (LS) packet or Horizontal Sync controls to determine \nthe start of lines. Timestamp operation is not supported if multiple video streams (Virtual Channels) are present \non a single Rx port.\nThe skew detection can run in either a FrameSync mode or free-run mode.\nSkew detection can be individually enabled for each RX port.\nFor start-of-line timestamps, a line number must be programmed. The same line number is used for all channels. \nPrior to reading timestamps, the TS_FREEZE bit for each port that will be read should be set. This will prevent \noverwrite of the timestamps by the detection circuit until all timestamps have been read. The freeze condition will \nbe released automatically once all frozen timestamps have been read. The freeze bits can also be cleared if it \ndoes not read all the timestamp values.\nThe TS_STATUS register includes the following:\n•Flags to indicate multiple start-of-frame per FrameSync period\n•Flag to indicate Timestamps Ready\n•Flags to indicate Timestamps valid (per port) – if ports are not synchronized, all ports may not indicate valid \ntimestamps\nThe Timestamp Ready flag will be cleared when the TS_FREEZE bit is cleared.\n7.5.11 Pattern Generation\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  supports an internal pattern generation feature to provide a simple way to generate video \ntest patterns for the CSI-2 transmitter outputs. Two types of patterns are supported: Reference Color Bar pattern \nand Fixed Color patterns and accessed by the Pattern Generator page 0 in the indirect register set.\nPrior to enabling the Packet Generator, the following should be done:\n1. Disable video forwarding by setting bits [5:4] of the FWD_CTL1 register (that is, set register 0x20 to 0x30).\n2. Configure CSI-2 Transmitter operating speed using the CSI_PLL_CTL register.\n3. Enable the CSI-2 Transmitter for port 0 using the CSI_CTL register\n7.5.11.1 Reference Color Bar Pattern\nThe Reference Color Bar Patterns are based on the pattern defined in Appendix D of the mipi_CTS_for_D-\nPHY_v1-1_r03 specification. The pattern is an eight color bar pattern designed to provide high, low, and medium \nfrequency outputs on the CSI-2 transmit data lanes.\nThe CSI-2 Reference pattern provides eight color bars by default with the following byte data for the color bars: \nX bytes of 0xAA (high-frequency pattern, inverted) X bytes of 0x33 (mid-frequency pattern) X bytes of 0xF0 DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n66 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n(low-frequency pattern, inverted) X bytes of 0x7F (lone 0 pattern) X bytes of 0x55 (high-frequency pattern) X \nbytes of 0xCC (mid-frequency pattern, inverted) X bytes of 0x0F (low-frequency pattern) Y bytes of 0x80 (lone 1 \npattern) In most cases, Y will be the same as X. For certain data types, the last color bar may need to be larger \nthan the others to properly fill the video line dimensions.\nThe Pattern Generator is programmable with the following options:\n•Number of color bars (1, 2, 4, or 8)\n•Number of bytes per line\n•Number of bytes per color bar\n•CSI-2 DataType field and VC-ID\n•Number of active video lines per frame\n•Number of total lines per frame (active plus blanking)\n•Line period (possibly program in units of 10 ns)\n•Vertical front porch – number of blank lines prior to FrameEnd packet\n•Vertical back porch – number of blank lines following FrameStart packet\nThe pattern generator relies on proper programming by software to ensure the color bar widths are set to \nmultiples of the block (or word) size required for the specified DataType. For example, for RGB888, the block \nsize is 3 bytes which also matches the pixel size. In this case, the number of bytes per color bar must be a \nmultiple of 3. The Pattern Generator is implemented in the CSI-2 Transmit clock domain, providing the pattern \ndirectly to the CSI-2 Transmitter. The circuit generates the CSI-2 formatted data.\n7.5.11.2 Fixed Color Patterns\nWhen programmed for Fixed Color Pattern mode, Pattern Generator can generate a video image with a \nprogrammable fixed data pattern. The basic programming fields for image dimensions are the same as used \nwith the Color Bar Patterns. When sending Fixed Color Patterns, the color bar controls allow alternating between \nthe fixed pattern data and the bit-wise inverse of the fixed pattern data.\nThe Fixed Color patterns assume a fixed block size for the byte pattern to be sent. The block size is \nprogrammable through the register and is designed to support most 8-bit, 10-bit, and 12-bit pixel formats. The \nblock size should be set based on the pixel size converted to blocks that are an integer multiple of bytes. For \nexample, an RGB888 pattern would consist of 3-byte pixels and therefore require a 3-byte block size. A 2x12-bit \npixel image would also require 3-byte block size, while a 3x12-bit pixel image would require nine bytes (two \npixels) to send an integer number of bytes. Sending a RAW10 pattern typically requires a 5-byte block size for \nfour pixels, so 1x10-bit and 2x10-bit could both be sent with a 5-byte block size. For 3x10-bit, a 15-byte block \nsize would be required.\nThe Fixed Color patterns support block sizes up to 16 bytes in length, allowing additional options for patterns \nin some conditions. For example, an RGB888 image could alternate between four different pixels by using a \ntwelve-byte block size. An alternating black and white RGB888 image could be sent with a block size of 6-bytes \nand setting first three bytes to 0xFF and next three bytes to 0x00.\nTo support up to 16-byte block sizes, a set of sixteen registers are implemented to allow programming the value \nfor each data byte. The line period is calculated in units of 10 ns, unless the CSI-2 mode is set to 400-Mb \noperation in which case the unit time dependancy is 20 ns.\n7.5.11.3 Packet Generator Programming\nThe information in this section provides details on how to program the Pattern Generator to provide a specific \ncolor bar pattern, based on datatype, frame size, and line size.\nMost basic configuration information is determined directly from the expected video frame parameters. The \nrequirements should include the datatype, frame rate (frames per second), number of active lines per frame, \nnumber of total lines per frame (active plus blanking), and number of pixels per line.\n•PGEN_ACT_LPF – Number of active lines per frame\n•PGEN_TOT_LPF – Number of total lines per frame\n•PGEN_LSIZE – Video line length size in bytes. Compute based on pixels per line multiplied by pixel size in \nbytes\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 67\n•CSI-2 DataType field and VC-ID\n•Optional: PGEN_VBP – Vertical back porch. This is the number of lines of vertical blanking following Frame \nValid\n•Optional: PGEN_VFP – Vertical front porch. This is the number of lines of vertical blanking preceding Frame \nValid\n•PGEN_LINE_PD – Line period in 10-ns units. Compute based on Frame Rate and total lines per frame\n•PGEN_BAR_SIZE – Color bar size in bytes. Compute based on datatype and line length in bytes (see details \nbelow)\n7.5.11.3.1 Determining Color Bar Size\nThe color bar pattern should be programmed in units of a block or word size dependent on the datatype of the \nvideo being sent. The sizes are defined in the Mipi CSI-2 specification. For example, RGB888 requires a 3-byte \nblock size which is the same as the pixel size. RAW10 requires a 5-byte block size which is equal to 4 pixels. \nRAW12 requires a 3-byte block size which is equal to 2 pixels.\nWhen programming the Pattern Generator, software should compute the required bar size in bytes based on \nthe line size and the number of bars. For the standard eight color bar pattern, that would require the following \nalgorithm:\n•Select the desired datatype, and a valid length for that datatype (in pixels).\n•Convert pixels/line to blocks/line (by dividing by the number of pixels/block, as defined in the datatype \nspecification).\n•Divide the blocks/line result by the number of color bars (8), giving blocks/bar\n•Round result down to the nearest integer\n•Convert blocks/bar to bytes/bar and program that value into the PGEN_BAR_SIZE register\nAs an alternative, the blocks/line can be computed by converting pixels/line to bytes/line and divide by bytes/\nblock.\n7.5.11.4 Code Example for Pattern Generator\n#Patgen Fixed Colorbar 1280x720p30\nWriteI2C(0x33,0x01) # CSI0 enable\nWriteI2C(0xB0,0x00) # Indirect Pattern Gen Registers\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x01) # PGEN_CTL\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x01)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x02) # PGEN_CFG\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x33)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x03) # PGEN_CSI_DI\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x24)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x04) # PGEN_LINE_SIZE1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x0F)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x05) # PGEN_LINE_SIZE0 \nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x00)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x06) # PGEN_BAR_SIZE1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x01)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x07) # PGEN_BAR_SIZE0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0xE0)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x08) # PGEN_ACT_LPF1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x02)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x09) # PGEN_ACT_LPF0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0xD0)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0A) # PGEN_TOT_LPF1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x04)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0B) # PGEN_TOT_LPF0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x1A)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0C) # PGEN_LINE_PD1\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x0C)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0D) # PGEN_LINE_PD0\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x67)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0E) # PGEN_VBP\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x21)\nWriteI2C(0xB1,0x0F) # PGEN_VFP\nWriteI2C(0xB2,0x0A)DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n68 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.5.12 FPD-Link BIST Mode\nAn optional At-Speed Built-In Self Test (BIST) feature supports testing of the high-speed serial link and the back \nchannel without external data connections. The BIST mode is enabled by either applying a logic high level to \nthe BISTEN pin or programming the BIST configuration register 0xB3. This is useful in the prototype stage, \nequipment production, in-system test, and system diagnostics.\nWhen BIST is activated, the DS90UB954-Q1  sends register writes to the Serializer through the Back Channel. \nThe control channel register writes configure the Serializer for BIST mode operation. The serializer outputs a \ncontinuous stream of a pseudo-random sequence and drives the link at speed. The deserializer detects the test \npattern and monitors it for errors. The serializer also tracks errors indicated by the CRC fields in each back \nchannel frame.\nThe LOCK, PASS and CMLOUT output functions are all available during BIST mode. While the lock indications \nare required to identify the beginning of proper data reception, for any link failures or data corruption, the best \nindication is the contents of the error counter in the BIST_ERR_COUNT register 0x57 for each RX port. The test \nmay select whether the Serializer uses an external or internal clock as reference for the BIST pattern frequency.\n7.5.12.1 BIST Operation Through BISTEN Pin\nOne method to enable BIST is by driving a logic high level on the BISTEN pin. During pin control BIST, the \nvalues on GPIO1 and GPIO0 pins will control whether the Serializer uses an external or internal clock for the \nBIST pattern. The values on GPIO1 and GPIO0 will be written to the Serializer register 0x14[2:1]. A value of \n00 will select an external clock. A non-zero value will enable an internal clock of the frequency defined in the \nSerializer register 0x14. Note that when the DS90UB954-Q1  is paired with DS90UB933-Q1 or DS90UB913A-\nQ1, a setting of 11 may result in a frequency that is too slow for the DS90UB954-Q1  to recover. The GPIO1 and \nGPIO0 values are sampled at the start of BIST (when BISTEN pin transitions to high). Changing this value after \nBIST is enabled will not change operation. Link BIST can also be enabled by register control through the BIST \nControl register (address 0xB3)\n7.5.12.2 BIST Operation Through Register Control\nThe FPD-Link III BIST is configured and enabled by programming the BIST Control register (address 0xB3). \nBIST pass or fail status may be brought to GPIO pins by selecting the Pass indication for each receive port using \nthe GPIOx_PIN_CTL registers. The Pass/Fail status will be deasserted low for each data error detected on the \nselected port input data. In addition, it is advisable to bring the Receiver Lock status for selected ports to the \nGPIO pins as well. After completion of BIST, the BIST Error Counter may be read to determine if errors occurred \nduring the test. If the DS90UB954-Q1  failed to lock to the input signal or lost lock to the input signal, the BIST \nError Counter will indicate 0xFF. The maximum normal count value will be 0xFE. The SER_BIST_ACT register \nbit 0xD0[5] can be monitored during testing to ensure BIST is activated in the serializer.\nDuring BIST, DS90UB954-Q1  output activity are gated by BIST_Control[7:6] (BIST_OUT_MODE[1:0]). as \nfollows:\n00 : Outputs disabled during BIST\n10 : Outputs enabled during BIST\nWhen enabling the outputs by setting BIST_OUT_MODE = 10, the CSI-2 will be inactive by default (LP11 state). \nTo exercise the CSI-2 interface during BIST mode, it is possible to Enable Pattern Generator to send a video \ndata pattern on the CSI-2 outputs.\nThe BIST clock frequency is controlled by the BIST_CLOCK_SOURCE field in the BIST Control register. This \n2-bit value will be written to the Serializer register 0x14[2:1]. A value of 00 will select an external clock. A \nnon-zero value will enable an internal clock of the frequency defined in the Serializer register 0x14. Note that \nwhen the DS90UB954-Q1  is paired with DS90UB933-Q1or DS90UB913A-Q1, a setting of 11 may result in a \nfrequency that is too slow for the DS90UB954-Q1  to recover. The BIST_CLOCK_SOURCE field is sampled at \nthe start of BIST. Changing this value after BIST is enabled will not change operation.\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 69\n7.6 Register Maps\nIn the register definitions under the TYPE  and DEFAULT  heading, the following definitions apply:\n•R = Read only access\n•R/W = Read / Write access\n•R/RC = Read only access, Read to Clear\n•(R/W)/SC = Read / Write access, Self-Clearing bit\n•(R/W)/S = Read / Write access, Set based on strap pin configuration at startup\n•LL = Latched Low and held until read\n•LH = Latched High and held until read\n•S = Set based on strap pin configuration at startup\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  implements the following register blocks, accessible through I2C as well as the bi-\ndirectional control channel:\n•Main Registers\n•FPD-Link III RX Port Registers (separate register block for each of the four RX ports)\n•CSI-2 Port Registers (separate register block for each of the CSI-2 ports)\nTable 7-18.

TI’s customers are responsible for determining \nsuitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\n8.1.1 System\nThe DS90UB954-Q1  is a highly integrated sensor hub chip which includes two FPD-Link III inputs targeted at \nADAS applications, such as front-, rear-, and surround-view cameras, camera monitoring systems, and sensor \nfusion.\n8.1.2 Power Over Coax\nThe DS90UB54-Q1  is designed to support the Power-over-Coax (PoC) method of powering remote sensor \nsystems. With this method, the power is delivered over the same medium (a coaxial cable) used for high-\nspeed digital video data and bidirectional control and diagnostics data transmission. The method uses passive \nnetworks or filters that isolate the transmission line from the loading of the DC/DC regulator circuits and their \nconnecting power traces on both sides of the link as shown in Figure 8-1 .\nPower\nSource\nBraided\nShieldCoaxial CablePoC PoC\nFPD-Link IIIPOWER\nRTERMCAC1DC-DC \nRegulators\nCAC2CAC1\nCAC2\nRTERMSensor Module\nImage SensorAutomotive ECU\nFPD-Link III\nDeserializerFPD-Link III\nSerializerProcessor\nSoC\nFigure 8-1. Power Over Coax (PoC) System Diagram\nThe PoC networks\' impedance of ≥ 1 k Ω over a specific frequency band is recommended to isolate the \ntransmission line from the loading of the regulator circuits. Higher PoC network impedance will contribute \nto favorable insertion loss and return loss characteristics in the high-speed channel. The lower limit of the \nfrequency band is defined as ½ of the frequency of the bidirectional control channel, f BCC. The upper limit of the \nfrequency band is the frequency of the forward high-speed channel, f FC. However, the main criteria that need to \nbe met in the total high-speed channel, which consists of a serializer PCB, a deserializer PCB, and a cable, are \nthe insertion loss and return loss limits defined in the Total Channel Requirements, while the system is under \nmaximum current load and extreme temperature conditions(1) (2).\n1. Contact TI for more information on the required Channel Specifications defined for each individual FPD-Link device.\n2. The PoC network and any components along the high-speed trace on the PCB will contribute to the PCB loss budget. TI has \nrecommendations for the loss budget allocation for each individual PCB and cable component in the overall high-speed channel, but \nthe loss limits defined for the total channel in the Channel Specifications must be met.DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n140 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-2  shows a PoC network recommended for a 4G FPD-Link III consisting of DS90UB953-Q1  and \nDS90UB954-Q1  pair with the bidirectional channel operating at 50 Mbps ( ½ f BCC = 25 MHz) and the forward \nchannel operating at 4.16 Gbps (f FC ≈ 2.1 GHz).\nVPoC\nL1C1\nFB2FB3\nFB110 nFC2\nR2RIN+\nRIN-CAC1\nCAC233 nF to 100 nF\n15 nF to 47 nF 49.9 :4.02 k:R1\n10 PH\n(Optional)\n(R = 0\r)> 10µF\nFigure 8-2.

Route the high-speed trace through one of its pads to avoid stubs.\n•Use the smallest component pads as allowed by manufacturer\'s design rules. Add anti-pads in the inner \nplanes below the component pads to minimize impedance drop.\n•Consult with connector manufacturer for optimized connector footprint. If the connector is mounted on the \nsame side as the IC, minimize the impactof the through-hole connector stubs by routing the high-speed signal \ntraces on the opposite side of the connector mounting side.\n•Use coupled 100-Ω differential signal traces from the device pins to the AC-coupling caps. Use 50-Ω single-\nended traces from the AC-coupling capacitors to the connector.\n•Terminate the inverting signal traces close to the connectors with standard 49.9-Ω resistors.\nThe suggested characteristics for single-ended PCB traces (microstrips or striplines) for serializer or deserializer \nboards are detailed in Table 8-3 .

Separate planes on the PCB are typically not \nrequired. provides guidance on which circuit blocks are connected to which power pin pairs. In some cases, an \nexternal filter many be used to provide clean power to sensitive circuits such as PLLs.\n9.1 VDD and VDDIO Power Supply\nEach VDD power supply pin must have a 10-nF (or 100-nF) capacitor to ground connected as close as possible \nto DS90UB954-Q1  device. When operating VDDIO at 1.8-V nominal supply, the voltage at VDDIO must be \nwithin ±100 mV of VDD18 to ensure VIH, VIL specifications. TI recommends having additional decoupling \ncapacitors (1 µF or 10 µF) connected to a common GND plane. Note that although average current for VDDIO is \nless than 10 mA maximum, the peak current into VDDIO may exceed 100 mA on device start-up.\n9.2 Power-Up Sequencing\nThe power-up sequence for the DS90UB954-Q1  is as follows:\nVDD18\nREFCLKT0\nVDDIO\nT1\nPDBHard \nReset\nDON’T CARET4T5 T6\nFigure 9-1.

PDB input must remain LOW while \nthe VDD pin power supplies are in transition. Typically PDB will be connected to GPIO from processor also \nwith internal pulldown. Alternatively, when VDD_SEL = LOW, an external RC network on the PDB pin may be \nconnected to ensure PDB arrives after all the supply pins have settled to the recommended operating voltage. \nWhen PDB pin is pulled up to VDD18, a 10-k Ω pullup and a > 10- μF capacitor to GND are recommended to \ndelay the PDB input signal rise. All inputs must not be driven until both power supplies have reached steady \nstate. When VDD_SEL = HIGH it is not recommended to connect PDB through RC circuit as this may conflict \nwith the sequencing of the external 1.1-V supply rail.\nTable 9-2.

When synchronous clocking mode is selected, the serializer will re-lock onto the extracted \nback channel reference clock once available so there is no need for local crystal oscillator at the sensor \nmodule ( Figure 9-3 ).

Good layout practice also separates high-frequency or high-level inputs and outputs to minimize \nunwanted noise pickup, feedback, and interference. Power system performance may be greatly improved \nby using thin dielectrics (2 to 4 mils) for power or ground sandwiches. This arrangement provides plane \ncapacitance for the PCB power system with low-inductance parasitics, which has proven especially effective \nat high frequencies, and makes the value and placement of external bypass capacitors less critical. External \nbypassing should be low-ESR ceramic capacitors with high-quality dielectric. The voltage rating of the ceramic \ncapacitors must be at least 2× the power supply voltage being used.\nTI recommends surface-mount capacitors due to their smaller parasitics. When using multiple capacitors per \nsupply pin, locate the smaller value closer to the pin. A large bulk capacitor is recommend at the point of \npower entry. This is typically in the 47-µF to 100-µF range, which smooths low frequency switching noise. TI \nrecommends connecting power and ground pins directly to the power and ground planes with bypass capacitors \nconnected to the plane with via on both ends of the capacitor. Connecting power or ground pins to an external \nbypass capacitor increases the inductance of the path.\nA small body size X7R chip capacitor, such as 0603 or 0402, is recommended for external bypass. Its small \nbody size reduces the parasitic inductance of the capacitor. The user must pay attention to the resonance \nfrequency of these external bypass capacitors, usually in the range of 20 to 30 MHz. To provide effective \nbypassing, multiple capacitors are often used to achieve low impedance between the supply rails over the \nfrequency of interest. At high frequency, it is also a common practice to use two vias from power and ground pins \nto the planes, reducing the impedance at high frequency.\nSome devices provide separate power and ground pins for different portions of the circuit. This is done to isolate \nswitching noise effects between different sections of the circuit. Separate planes on the PCB are typically not \nrequired. Pin Description tables typically provide guidance on which circuit blocks are connected to which power \npin pairs. In some cases, an external filter may be used to provide clean power to sensitive circuits such as PLLs\nUse at least a four-layer board with a power and ground plane. Locate CSI-2 signals away from the single-ended \nor differential FPD RX input traces to prevent coupling from the CSI-2 signals to the RX inputs. The following \nsections provide important details for routing the FPD-Link III traces, PoC filter, and CSI-2 traces.\n10.1.1 Ground\nTI recommends that a consistent ground plane reference for the high-speed signals in the PCB design to \nprovide the best image plane for signal traces running parallel to the plane. Connect the thermal pad of the \nDS90UB954-Q1  to the GND plane with vias.\n10.1.2 Routing FPD-Link III Signal Traces and PoC Filter\nRouting the FPD-Link III signal traces between the R IN pins and the connector as well as connecting the PoC \nfilter to these traces are the most critical pieces of a successful DS90UB954-Q1  PCB layout. Figure 10-1  shows \nan example PCB layout of the DS90UB954-Q1  configured for interface to remote sensor modules over coaxial \ncables. The layout example also uses a footprint of an edge-mount FAKRA connector provided by Rosenberger \n(P/N: 59S20X-40ML5-Z). For additional PCB layout details of the example, check the DS90UB954-Q1EVM \nuser\'s guide.\nThe following list provides essential recommendations for routing the FPD-Link III signal traces between the \nDS90UB954-Q1EVM  receiver input pins (R IN) and the FAKRA connector, and connecting the PoC filter.\n•The routing of the FPD-Link III traces may be all on the top layer (as shown in the example) or partially \nembedded in middle layers if EMI is a concern\n•The AC-coupling capacitors should be on the top layer and very close to the DS90UB954-Q1EVM  receiver \ninput pins to minimize the length of coupled differential trace pair between the pins and the capacitors.\n•Route the RIN+ trace between the AC-coupling capacitor and the FAKRA connector as a 50-Ω single-ended \nmicro-strip with tight impedance control (±10%). Calculate the proper width of the trace for a 50-Ω impedance \nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 153\nbased on the PCB stack-up. Ensure that the trace can carry the PoC current for the maximum load presented \nby the remote sensor module.\n•The PoC filter should be connected to the RIN+ trace through the first ferrite bead (FB 1). The FB 1 should be \ntouching the high-speed trace to minimize the stub length seen by the transmission line. Create an anti-pad \nor a moat under the FB 1 pad that touches the trace. The anti-pad should be a plane cutout of the ground \nplane directly underneath the top layer without cutting out the ground reference under the trace. The purpose \nof the anti-pad is to maintain the impedance as close to 50 Ω as possible.\n•Route the RIN– trace loosely coupled to the RIN+ trace for the length similar to the RIN+ trace length when \npossible. This will help the differential nature of the receiver to cancel out any common-mode noise that may \nbe present in the environment that may couple on to the RIN+ and RIN– signal traces. When routing on inner \nlayers, length matching for single-ended traces does not provide as significant benefit.\nWhen configured for STP and routing differential signals to the DS90UB954-Q1  receiver inputs, the traces \nshould maintain 100- Ω differential impedance routed to the connector. When choosing to implement a common \nmode choke for common mode noise reduction, take care to minimize the effect of any mismatch. Figure 10-2 \nshows an example PCB layout for STP configuration.DS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n154 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n10.1.3 Routing CSI-2 Signal Traces\nRouting the CSI-2 signal traces between the CSI-2 pins and the CSI-2 connector is also important for a \nsuccessful DS90UB954-Q1  PCB layout. Figure 10-1  shows essential details for routing the CSI-2 traces. \nAdditional recommendations are given in the following list:\n1.Route CSI_D0N, CSI_D0P, CSI_D1N, and CSI_D1P pairs as differential coupled striplines with controlled \n100-Ω differential impedance (±10%)\n2.Keep the trace length difference between CSI-2 traces to 5 mils of each other.\n3.Length matching should be near the location of mismatch.\n4.Each pair should be separated at least by 5 times the signal trace width.\n5.Keep away from other high-speed signals.\n6.Keep the use of bends in differential traces to a minimum. When bends are used, the number of left and right \nbends must be as equal as possible, and the angle of the bend should be ≥ 135 degrees. This arrangement \nminimizes any length mismatch caused by the bends and therefore minimizes the impact that bends have on \nEMI.\n7.Route all differential pairs on one or two inner layers.\n8.Keep the number of signal vias to a minimum — TI recommends keeping the via count to the maximum of \ntwo per CSI-2 trace.\n9.Keep traces on layers adjacent to ground plane.\n10.Do NOT route differential pairs over any plane split.\n11.Adding Test points causes impedance discontinuity and therefore negatively impacts signal performance. If \ntest points are used, place them in series and symmetrically. Test points must not be placed in a manner that \ncauses a stub on the differential pair.\nwww.ti.comDS90UB954-Q1\nSNLS570C – AUGUST 2017 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 155\n10.2 Layout Examples\nCAC CACFB1 FB2\nL1 R1PoC Filter49.9:\nRIN- RIN+PoC Voltage \nEntry Point\nThermal vias \nunder \nDS90UB954 PADPlace AC coupling \ncaps close to RIN \npins to minimize the \nlength of the RIN \ndifferential traces \nRIN PinsRoute RIN- trace \nloosely coupled to the \nRIN+ trace (S > 3W)Place the smallest \nferrite bead or RF \ninductor orthogonally \nright next to  the RIN+ \ntrace\nMoat the GND plane \nunderneath the FB 1 \npad touching the RIN+ \ntrace to minimize \nparasitic capacitance, \nbut maintain the GND \nplane underneath the \nRIN+ traceRoute RIN+ trace as a \n50-: single-ended \ntrace with tight \nimpedance control \n(±10%)Follow PCB footprint \nrecommendations \nfrom the connector \nmanufacturer to \nmaintain 50- :\x03\nimpedance through \nthe connector\nEnsure RIN+ trace \ncan carry PoC current \nwithout significant \ntemperature rise \n(<10°C) \n*W is a trace width.
