Various LED colors \nare available in nine compact, single-color packages.\nThe HSMx-C150 has the industry-standard 3.2 mm × \n1.6 mm footprint, which is excellent for all-around use. The \nHSMx-C170 has the widely used 2.0 mm × 1.25 mm \nfootprint with a 0.8-mm profile. The HSMx-C177 has the \nwidely used 2.0 mm × 1.25 mm footprint with a 0.4-mm \nprofile. The HSMx-C19x series has the industry-standard \n1.6 mm × 0.8 mm footprint with a varying profile to suit \ndesigners needs: the HSMx-C190 has a 0.8-mm profile, the \nHSMx-C191 has a low profile of 0.6 mm, and the HSMx-\nC197 has an ultra-low profile of 0.4 mm. This family with its \nthin profile and wide viewing angle makes this LED \nexceptional for backlighting applications.\nThe HSMx-C110 is a right angle package with the \nuniversally accepted dimensions of 3.2 × 1.0 x 1.5 mm. The \nHSMx-C120 is a smaller right angle package with industry \nstandard 1.6 × 0.6 x 1.0 mm. HSMx-C265 is a reverse \nmount package with dimensions of 3.4 × 1.25 x 1.1 mm. \nThese devices are ideal for LCD backlighting and \nsidelighting applications.\nTo facilitate pick and place operation, these chipLEDs are \nshipped in tape and reel with 4000 units per reel for HSMx-\nC120, C170, C177, C190, C191, and C197 packages and \nwith 3000 units per reel for HSMx-C110, C150, and C265 \npackages.All packages are compatible with IR reflow solder \nprocesses. The small size and wide viewing angle make \nthese LEDs prime choices for backlighting applications and \nfront-panel illumination, especially where space is a \npremium.\nFeatures\n\uf06eSmall size\n\uf06eIndustry-standard footprint\n\uf06eCompatible with IR solder\n\uf06eDiffused optics\n\uf06eOperating temperature range of –40°C to +85°C\n\uf06eRight angle and reverse mount package available\n\uf06eVarious colors available\n\uf06eAvailable in 8-mm tape on 7-in.

Observe necessary precautions for handling a moisture-sensitive \ndevice as stated in the following section.\n\uf06eDo not apply any pressure or force on the LED during reflow and after reflow when the LED is still hot. \n\uf06eUse reflow soldering to solder the LED. Use hand soldering only for rework if unavoidable, but it must be strictly \ncontrolled to the following conditions:\n– Soldering iron tip temperature = 310°C max.\n– Soldering duration = 2 seconds max.\n– Number of cycles = 1 only\n– Power of soldering iron = 50W max.\n\uf06eDo not touch the LED package body with the soldering iron except for the soldering terminals, as it may cause damage \nto the LED. \n\uf06eConfirm beforehand whether the functionality and performance of the LED is affected by hand soldering. \nFigure 21:  Recommended Lead-Free Reflow Soldering Profile\n217°C\n200°C\n60 - 120 SEC.6°C/SEC.

Refer to Broadcom Application Note AN5305, \nHandling of Moisture Sensitive Surface Mount Devices , for additional details and a review of proper handling procedures.\n\uf06eBefore use:\n– An unopened moisture barrier bag (MBB) can be stored at <40°C/90% RH for 12 months. If the actual shelf life has \nexceeded 12 months and the Humidity Indicator Card (HIC) indicates that baking is not required, then it is safe to \nreflow the LEDs per the original MSL rating.\n– Do not open the MBB prior to assembly (for example, for IQC). If unavoidable, the MBB must be properly resealed \nwith fresh desiccant and the HIC. The exposed duration must be taken in as floor life.\n\uf06eControl after opening the MBB:\n– Read the HIC immediately upon opening of MBB.\n– Keep the LEDs at <30°/60%RH at all times, and complete all high-temperature-related processes, including \nsoldering, curing, or rework, within 672 hours. \n\uf06eControl for unfinished reel:\nStore unused LEDs in a sealed MBB with desiccant or a desiccator at <5%RH.\n\uf06eControl of assembled boards:\nIf the PCB soldered with the LEDs is to be subjected to other high-temperature processes, store the PCB in a sealed \nMBB with desiccant or a desiccator at <5% RH to ensure that all LEDs have not exceeded their floor life of 672 hours.\n\uf06eBaking is required if:\n– The HIC indicator indicates a change in color for 10% and 5%, as stated on the HIC.\n– The LEDs are exposed to conditions of >30°C/60% RH at any time.\n– The LED’s floor life has exceeded 672 hours.\nThe recommended baking condition is 60±5ºC for 20 hours.\nBaking can be done only once.\nApplication Precautions\n\uf06eThe drive current of the LED must not exceed the maximum allowable limit across temperature as stated in the data \nsheet. Constant current driving is recommended to ensure consistent performance. \n\uf06eCircuit design must cater to the whole range of forward voltage (VF) of the LEDs to ensure that the intended drive \ncurrent can always be achieved.\n\uf06eThe LED exhibits slightly different characteristics at different drive currents, which may result in a larger variation of \nperformance (meaning: intensity, wavelength, and forward voltage). Set the application current as close as possible to \nthe test current to minimize these variations.\n\uf06eDriving the LED at low current (<2 mA) will not cause functional failures to the LED (for example, open/short). However, \nthe variation in intensity will be larger than the existing intensity bin ratio of 1:1.6.\n\uf06eIf the LED is intended to be used along with an LED of another color to achieve color mixing, Broadcom does not \nguarantee the consistency of the resultant color. Do contact your Broadcom sale representative for such application.\n\uf06eThe LED is not intended for reverse bias. Use other appropriate components for such purposes. When driving the LED \nin matrix form, ensure that the reverse bias voltage does not exceed the allowable limit of the LED.\n\uf06eAvoid a rapid change in ambient temperature, especially in high-humidity environments, because it causes \ncondensation on the LED.\n\uf06eIf the LED is intended to be used in a harsh or outdoor environment, protect the LED against damages caused by rain \nwater, water, dust, oil, corrosive gases, external mechanical stresses, and so on.\nBroadcom AV02-0551EN\n21HSMD-Cxxx, HSMG-Cxxx, HSMH-Cxxx, HSMS-Cxxx, HSMY-Cxxx  Data Sheet Surface Mount ChipLEDs\nEye Safety Precautions\nLEDs may pose optical hazards when in operation.
