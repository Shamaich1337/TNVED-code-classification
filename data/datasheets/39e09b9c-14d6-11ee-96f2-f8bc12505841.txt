First,  a precision temperature-\ncompensated reference and comparator circuit monitor the status of V CC. When an out-of-tolerance\ncondition occurs, an internal power-fail signal is generated which forces the reset(s) to an active state.When V\nCC returns to an in-tolerance condition, the reset si gnal is kept in the active state for a minimum of\n140ms to allow the power supply and processor to stabilize.DS1814/DS1819\n5V and 3.3V MicroMonito r\nwww.maxim-ic.com\n321\n45\nSOT-23-5 PACKAGE\nSee Mech.

The DS 1814/9 ‘A’ and ‘B’ versions perform\na watchdog function. The watchdog is an internal timer th at forces the reset signals to the active state if\nthe strobe input does not change state every 1.12 seconds. The watchdog timer function can be disabled\nby leaving the watchdog strobe input disconnected.\nOPERATION\nPower Monitor\nThe DS1814 detects out-of-tolerance power supply c onditions and warns a processor-based system of\nimpending power failure. When V CC falls below a preset level, a comparator outputs the signal RST (or\nRST). RST (or RST) are excellent control signals for a mic roprocessor, as processing is stopped at the\nlast possible moment of valid V CC. On power-up, RST (or RST) are kept active for a minimum of 140ms\nto allow the power supply and processor to stabilize.\nPushbutton Reset\nThe DS1814 ‘A’ and ‘C’ provide an i nput pin for direct connection to a pushbutton reset (see Figure 2).\nThe pushbutton reset input requires an active low sign al.  Internally, this input is debounced and timed\nsuch that a RST (or RST) signal of at least 140ms minimum will be generated. The 140ms delay\ncommences as the pushbutton reset input is re leased from the low level (see Figure 3).\nWatchdog Timer\nThe DS1814/DS1819 ‘A’ and ‘B ’ versions watchdog timer function forces RST (and RST) signal(s)\nactive when the ST input is not clocked within the 1.12 s econd watchdog time-out period. Time-out of\nthe watchdog starts when RST (and RST) become(s) inactive. If a transition occurs on the ST input pin\nprior to time-out, the watchdog timer is reset and begins to time out again. If the watchdog timer isallowed to time out, then the reset output(s) will go  active for 140ms. The watchdog can be disabled by\nfloating (or tri-stating) the \nST input.\nThe ST input can be derived from many microprocessor outputs. The most typical signals used are the\nmicroprocessor data I/O signals and control signals. When the microprocessor functions normally, these\nsignals would as a matter of routine cause the watchdog to be reset prior to time-out. To guarantee thatthe watchdog timer does not time out, a transition mu st occur at or less than 1.12 seconds. A typical\ncircuit example is shown in Figure 4. The DS1814/19 watchdog function can be disabled at any time by\ntri-starting the strobe input. A sample circuit to disable the watchdog is shown in Figure 6.\nDS1814/DS1819\n3 of 8DS1814/DS1819 BLOCK DIAGRAM Figure 1\n*Notes:\nST  available on\'A\' and \'B\' versions\nPBRST  available on \'A\' and \'C\' versions\nRST available on \'B\' and \'C\' versions\nPUSHBUTTON RESET Figure 2\nTIMING DIAGRAM: PUSHBUTTON RESET Figure 3\n\nDS1814/DS1819\n4 of 8WATCHDOG TIMER Figure 4\nTIMING DIAGRAM: STROBE INPUT Figure 5\nWATCHDOG DISABLE CIRCUIT Figure 6\nTIMING DIAGRAM: POWER-DOWN Figure 7\n\nDS1814/DS1819\n5 of 8TIMING DIAGRAM: POWER-UP Figure 8\nRST VALID TO 0 VOLTS V CC Figure 9\nOUTPUT VALID CONDITIONS\nThe RST output uses a push-pull output which can maintain a valid output down to 1.0V V CC.
