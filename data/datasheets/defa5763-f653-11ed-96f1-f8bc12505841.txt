### Component Summary: LFCN-5000+

**Type:** Low Pass Filter (Ceramic)

**Description:**
The LFCN-5000+ is a ceramic low pass filter designed for RF applications. It operates within a frequency range of DC to 5000 MHz, providing excellent insertion loss and power handling capabilities. The filter is constructed using LTCC (Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic) technology, which enhances its temperature stability and performance.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; however, the RF power input is rated at 39 W max at 25°C.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified; current handling is typically related to power ratings.
- **Power Consumption:** 39 W maximum RF input power.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206 (small size).
- **Special Features:**
  - Excellent power handling (up to 9 W).
  - 7-section design for improved performance.
  - Temperature stable.
  - Protected by U.S. Patent 6,943,646.
  - RoHS compliant.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data.

**Typical Performance:**
- **Insertion Loss:** 
  - DC to 5000 MHz: ≤ 1.0 dB
  - Cut-off Frequency (F2): 5580 MHz, with a loss of ≤ 3.0 dB.
- **VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio):** 
  - DC to 5000 MHz: ≤ 1.2:1
  - Stop Band (6850-18000 MHz): ≤ 20:1.
- **Stop Band Rejection Loss:**
  - 6850 MHz: ≥ 20 dB
  - 7050 MHz: ≥ 30 dB
  - 18000 MHz: ≥ 20 dB.

**Applications:**
The LFCN-5000+ is typically used in:
- Harmonic rejection applications.
- VHF/UHF transmitters and receivers.
- Laboratory use for signal processing and filtering.
- Any RF applications requiring low pass filtering to eliminate unwanted high-frequency signals while allowing lower frequencies to pass through.

This low pass filter is ideal for use in communication systems, RF signal processing, and other applications where signal integrity is crucial.
