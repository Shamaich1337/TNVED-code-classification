A ferroelectric random accessmemory or F-RAM is nonvolatile and performs reads and writes\nsimilar to a RAM. It provides reliable data retention for 151 y ears\nwhile eliminating the complexities, overhead, and system-levelreliability problems caused by EEPROM and other nonvolatile\nmemories. \nUnlike EEPROM, the FM24C16B performs write operations at\nbus speed. No write delays are incurred. Data is written to thememory array immediately af ter each byte is successfully\ntransferred to the device. The next bus cycle can commence\nwithout the need for data polling. In addition, the product off ers\nsubstantial write endurance compared with ot her nonvolatile\nmemories. Also, F-RAM exhibits much lower power during writes\nthan EEPROM since write operations do not require an internallyelevated power supply voltage for write circuits. The FM24C16B\nis capable of supporting 10\n14 read/write cycles, or 100 million\ntimes more write c ycles than EEPROM. \nThese capabilities make the FM24C16B ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications, requirin g frequent or rapid writes.\nExamples range from data logg ing, where the number of write\ncycles may be critical, to demandi ng industrial controls where the\nlong write time of EEPROM can cause data loss. The\ncombination of features allows more frequent data writing with\nless overhead for the system.\nThe FM24C16B provides substantial benefits to users of serial\n(I2C) EEPROM as a hardware drop-in replacement. The device\nspecifications are guaranteed o ver an industrial temperature\nrange of –40 \uf0b0C to +85 \uf0b0C.\nFor a complete list of re lated documentation, click here.\nLogic Block Diagram\nAddress \nLatch2 K x 8\nF-RAM Array\nData Latch8\nSDACounter\nSerial to Parallel\nConverter\nControl LogicSCL\nWP11\n8\nFM24C16B\nDocument Number: 001-84450 Rev. *M Page 2 of 18Contents\nPinout ........................................................ ........................3\nPin Definitions ............................................... ...................3\nFunctional Overview ........................................... .............4\nMemory Architecture ........................................... .............4\nI2C Interface ................................................. .....................4\nSTOP Condition (P) ............................................ .........4\nSTART Condition (S) ........................................... ........4\nData/Address Transfer ......................................... .......5\nAcknowledge/No-acknowledge . ..................................5\nSlave Device Address ....... ................................... .......6\nAddressing Overview (Word Ad dress) ........................6\nData Transfer ................................................. .............6\nMemory Operation .............................................. ..............6\nWrite Operation ............................................... ............6\nRead Operation ................................................ ...........7\nEndurance ..................................................... ....................8\nMaximum Ratings ............................................... ..............9\nOperating Range ............................................... ................9\nDC Electrical Characteristics ................................. .........9\nData Retention and Endurance .................................. ...10Capacitance ................................................... ................. 10\nThermal Resistance ............................................ ............ 10\nAC Test Loads and Waveforms ................................... .. 10\nAC Test Conditions ............................................ ............ 10\nAC Switching Characteristics .................................. ..... 11\nPower Cycle Timing ............................................ ........... 12\nOrdering Information .......................................... ............ 13\nOrdering Code Definitions ..................................... .... 13\nPackage Diagram ............................................... ............. 14\nAcronyms ...................................................... .................. 15\nDocument Conventions .......................................... ....... 15\nUnits of Measure .............................................. ......... 15\nDocument History Page ......................................... ........ 16\nSales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 1 8\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 18\nProducts ...................................................... .............. 18\nPSoC®Solutions ................................................ ....... 18\nCypress Developer Community . ................................ 18\nTechnical Support ........... .................................. ........ 18\nFM24C16B\nDocument Number: 001-84450 Rev. *M Page 3 of 18Pinout\nFigure 1.  8-pin SOIC pinout\nWP\nSCL1\n2\n3\n4  5NC  8\n 7\n 6VDD\nSDANC Top View\nnot to scale\nVSSNC\nPin Definitions\nPin Name I/O Type Description\nSDA Input/Output Serial Data/Address .

The memory array\nis logically organized as 2,048 × 8 bits and is accessed using an\nindustry-standard I2C interface. The functional operation of the\nF-RAM is similar to serial (I2C) EEPROM. The major difference\nbetween the FM24C16B and a serial (I2C) EEPROM with the\nsame pinout is the F-RAM's superior write performance, high\nendurance, and low po wer consumption. \nMemory Architecture\nWhen accessing the FM24C16B, the user addresses 2K\nlocations of eight data bits each. These eight data bits are sh ifted\nin or out serially. The addresses are accessed using the I2C\nprotocol, which includes a slave address (to distinguish othernon-memory devices), a row address, and a segment address.\nThe row address consists of 8-bits that specify one of the 256\nrows. The 3-bit segment address sp ecifies one of the 8 segments\nwithin each row. The complete address of 11-bits specifies each\nbyte address uniquely. \nThe access time for the memory operation is essentially zero,\nbeyond the time needed for the serial protocol. That is, the\nmemory is read or written at the speed of the I\n2C bus. Unlike a\nserial (I2C) EEPROM, it is not necessa ry to poll the device for a\nready condition because writes  occur at bus speed. By the time\na new bus transaction can be shifted into the device, a writeoperation is complete. This is explained in more detail in the\ninterface section. \nNote that the FM24C16B contains no power management\ncircuits other than a simple internal power-on reset. It is the\nuser’s responsibility to ensure that VDD is within data sheet\ntolerances to prevent  incorrect operation.\nI2C Interface\nThe FM24C16B employs a bi-directional I2C bus protocol using\nfew pins or board space. Figure 2  illustrates a typical system\nconfiguration using the FM24C16B in a microcontroller-based\nsystem. The indust ry standard I2C bus is familiar to many users\nbut is described in this section. \nBy convention, any device that i s sending data onto the bus is\nthe transmitter while the target device for this data is the re ceiver.\nThe device that is controlling the bus is the master. The maste r\nis responsible for generating the clock signal for all operatio ns.\nAny device on the bus that is be ing controlled is a slave. The\nFM24C16B is always a slave device. \nThe bus protocol is controlled by transition states in the SDA and\nSCL signals. There are four conditions including START, STOP,\ndata bit, or acknowledge. Figure 3 on page 5  and Figure 4 on\npage 5  illustrates the signal conditions that specify the four\nstates. Detailed timing diagrams are shown in the electrical\nspecifications section.\nSTOP Condition (P)\nA STOP condition is indicated when the bus master drives SDAfrom LOW to HIGH while the SCL signal is HIGH. All operationsusing the FM24C16B should end with a STOP condition. If an\noperation is in progress when a STOP is asserted, the operation\nwill be aborted. The master must have control of SDA in order t o\nassert a STOP condition. START Condition (S)\nA START condition is indicated when the bus master drives SDAfrom HIGH to LOW while the SCL signal is HIGH. All commandsshould be preceded by a START condition. An operation in\nprogress can be aborted by asserting a START condition at any\ntime. Aborting an operation using the START condition will read y\nthe FM24C16B for a new operation. \nIf during operation the power supply drops below the specified\nV\nDD minimum, the system should issue a START condition prior\nto performing another operation.

Except under the two conditions described\nabove, the SDA signal should n ot change while SCL is HIGH.\nAcknowledge/No-acknowledge\nThe acknowledge takes place after the 8th data bit has been\ntransferred in any transaction. Du ring this state the transmitt er\nshould release the SDA bus to allow the receiver to drive it. T he\nreceiver drives the SDA signal LOW to acknowledge receipt ofthe byte. If the receiver does not drive SDA LOW, the conditionis a no-acknowledge and the operation is aborted.The receiver would fail to acknowledge for two distinct reasons .\nFirst is that a byte transfer fails. In this case, the no-ackno wledge\nceases the current operation so that the device can be\naddressed again. This allows the last byte to be recovered in t he\nevent of a communication error. \nSecond and most common, the receiver does not acknowledge\nto deliberately end an operation. For example, during a read\noperation, the FM24C16B will continue to place data onto the\nbus as long as the receiver sends acknowledges (and clocks).When a read operation is complete and no more data is needed,the receiver must not acknowledge the last byte. If the receive r\nacknowledges the last byte, thi s will cause the FM24C16B to\nattempt to drive the bus on the next clock while the master issending a new command such as STOP.Figure 3.

As shown in Figure 6 , the slave\naddress contains the device ty pe, the page of memory to be\naccessed, and a bit that specifies if the transaction is a read  or\na write. \nBits 7–4 are the device type and should be set to 1010b for the\nFM24C16B. These bits allow other function types to reside on\nthe I2C bus within an identical address range. Bits 3–1 are the\npage select. It specifies the 2 56-byte block of memory that is\ntargeted for the current operation. Bit 0 is the read/write bit\n(R/W ). R/W  = ‘1’ indicates a read operation and R/W  =  ‘ 0 ’\nindicates a write operation.\nAddressing Overview (Word Address)\nAfter the FM24C16B (as receiver) acknowledges the slave\naddress, the master can place the word address on the bus for\na write operation. The word address is the lower 8-bits of theaddress to be combined with the 3-bits page select to specify\nexactly the byte to be written. T he complete 11-bit address is\nlatched internally. No word addr ess occurs for a read operation ,\nthough the 3-bit page select is latched internally. Reads alway s\nuse the lower 8-bits that are hel d internally in the address la tch.\nThat is, reads always begin at the address following the previo us\naccess. A random read address can be loaded by doing a write\noperation as explained below. \nAfter transmission of each data byte, just prior to the\nacknowledge, the FM24C16B increments the internal address\nlatch. This allows the next sequential byte to be accessed withno additional addressing. After the last address (7FFh) is\nreached, the address latch will roll over to 000h. There is no limit\nto the number of bytes that can  be accessed with a single read\nor write operation. \nData Transfer\nAfter the address bytes have been transmitted, data transfer\nbetween the bus master and the FM24C16B can begin. For a\nread operation the FM24C16B will place 8 data bits on the busthen wait for an acknowledge from the master. If the\nacknowledge occurs, the FM24C16B will transfer the nextsequential byte. If the acknowledge is not sent, the FM24C16B\nwill end the read operation. For a write operation, the FM24C16 B\nwill accept 8 data bits from the master then send anacknowledge. All data transfer occurs MSB (most significant bit )\nfirst. \nMemory Operation\nThe FM24C16B is designed to o perate in a manner very similar\nto other I2C interface memory products. The major differences\nresult from the higher perform ance write capability of F-RAM\ntechnology. These improvement s result in some differences\nbetween the FM24C16B and a s imilar confi guration EEPROM\nduring writes. The complete operation for both writes and readsis explained below. \nWrite Operation\nAll writes begin with a slave a ddress, then a word address. The\nbus master indicates a write o peration by setting the LSB of th e\nslave address (R/W  bit) to a ‘0’. After addressing, the bus master\nsends each byte of data to the memory and the memory\ngenerates an acknowledge condit ion. Any number of sequential\nbytes may be written. If the end of the address range is reache d\ninternally, the address counter  will wrap from 7FFh to 000h.\nUnlike other nonvolatile memory  technologies, there is no\neffective write delay with F-RAM. Since the read and write\naccess times of the underlying memory are the same, the user\nexperiences no delay through the  bus. The entire memory cycle\noccurs in less time than a single bus clock. Therefore, any\noperation including read or write can occur immediately followi ng\na write. Acknowledge polling, a  technique used with EEPROMs\nto determine if a write is complete is unnecessary and will alw ays\nreturn a ready condition.\nInternally, an actual memory write occurs after the 8th data bi t is\ntransferred. It will be complete before the acknowledge is sent .\nTherefore, if the user desires to abort a write without alterin g the\nmemory contents, this should be done using START or STOP\ncondition prior to the 8th data bit. The FM24C16B uses no page\nbuffering. \nThe memory array can be write -protected using the WP pin.\nSetting the WP pin to a HIGH condition (VDD) will write-protect\nall addresses. The FM24C16B will not acknowledge data bytes\nthat are written to p rotected addresses. In addition, the addre ss\ncounter will not increment if wr ites are attempted to these\naddresses. Setting WP to a LOW state (VSS) will disable the write\nprotect. WP is pulled down internally. \nFigure 7  and Figure 8 on page 7  below illustrate a single-byte\nand multiple-byte write cycles.Figure 6.

They are current\naddress read and selective address read. In a current addressread, the FM24C16B uses the internal address latch to supply\nthe lower 8 address bits. In a selective read, the user perform s a\nprocedure to set these lower add ress bits to a specific value. \nCurrent Address & Sequential Read\nAs mentioned above the FM24C16B uses an internal latch to\nsupply the lower 8 address bits for a read operation. A currentaddress read uses the existing value in the address latch as a\nstarting place for the read ope ration. The system reads from th e\naddress immediately following that of the la st operation. \nTo perform a current address read, the bus master supplies a\nslave address with the LSB set to a ‘1’. This indicates that a read\noperation is requested. The three page select bits in the slave\naddress specifies the block of memory that is used for the read\noperation. After receiving the complete slave address, theFM24C16B will begin shifting out data from the current address\non the next clock. The current address is the 3-bits from the s lave\naddress combined with the 8-bits that were in the internaladdress latch. Beginning with the current address, the bus master can read any\nnumber of bytes. Thus, a sequential read is simply a currentaddress read with multiple byte transfers. After each byte the\ninternal address counte r will be incremented. \nNote  Each time the bus master acknowledges a byte, this\nindicates that the FM24C16B should read out the next sequential\nbyte.  \nThere are four ways to properly terminate a read operation.\nFailing to properly terminate the read will most likely create a bus\ncontention as the FM24C16B attempts to read out additional\ndata onto the bus. The f our valid methods are:\n1. The bus master issues a no-acknowledge in the 9th clock \ncycle and a STOP in the 10th clo ck cycle. This is illustrated i n \nthe diagrams below. This is preferred. \n2. The bus master issues a no-acknowledge in the 9th clock \ncycle and a STAR T in the 10th. \n3. The bus master issues a S TOP in the 9th clock cycle.\n4. The bus master issues a STA RT in the 9th clock cycle. \nIf the internal address reaches 7FFh, it will wrap around to 00 0h\non the next read cycle. Figure 9  and Figure 10  below show the\nproper operation for current address reads.Figure 8.

Th is\ninvolves using the first two byt es of a write operation to set the\ninternal address followed by s ubsequent read operations. \nTo perform a selective read, the bus master sends out the slave\naddress with the LSB (R/W )  s e t  t o  0 .  T h i s  s p e c i f i e s  a  w r i t eoperation. According to the writ e protocol, the bus master then\nsends the word address byte that is loaded into the internal\naddress latch. After the FM24C16B acknowledges the wordaddress, the bus master issues a START condition. This simul-\ntaneously aborts the write operation and allows the read\ncommand to be issued with the slave address LSB set to a ‘1’.The operation is now a  current address read.\nEndurance\nThe FM24C16B internally operates with a read and restore\nmechanism. Therefore,  endurance cycles a re applied for each\nread or write cycle. The memory architecture is based on an\narray of rows and columns. Each read or write access causes an\nendurance cycle for an entire row. In the FM24C16B, a row is 64bits wide. Every 8-byte boundary marks the beginning of a newrow. Endurance can be optimized by ensuring frequently\naccessed data is located in different rows. Regardless, FRAMread and write endurance is effectively unlimited at the 1MHz I\n2C\nspeed. Even at 3000 accesses per second to the same row,\n10 years time will elapse before 1 trillion endurance cycles occ ur.Figure 11.
