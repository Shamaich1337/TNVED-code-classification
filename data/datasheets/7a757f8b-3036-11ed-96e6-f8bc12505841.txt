The architecture is basedon capacitive redistribution which inherently includes a S/Hfunction. The converter is fabricated on a 0.6 µ CMOS\nprocess. See Figure 1 for the basic operating circuit for theADS7835.\nThe ADS7835 requires an external clock to run the conver-\nsion process. This clock can vary between 200kHz (12.5kHzthroughput) and 8MHz (500kHz throughput). The duty cycleof the clock is unimportant as long as the minimum HIGHand LOW times are at least 50ns and the clock period is atleast 125ns. The minimum clock frequency is set by theleakage on the capacitors internal to the ADS7835.\nThe analog input to the ADS7835 is single-ended. The\nADS7835 provides a true bipolar input where the input willswing below ground. When using the internal 2.5V refer-ence the input range is ±2.5V (within ±20mV for the low\ngrade and ±12mV for the high grade). When using an\nexternal reference the input range is –V\nREF to +VREF. The\nADS7835 will accept an external reference with a range of2.3V to 2.9V.\nThe digital result of the conversion is provided in a serial\nmanner, synchronous to the CLK input. The provided resultis Most Significant Bit (MSB) first and represents the resultof the conversion currently in progress—there is no pipelinedelay.  By properly controlling the CONV and CLK inputs,it is possible to obtain the digital result Least Significant Bit(LSB) first.\nANALOG INPUT\nThe analog input (pin 2) of the ADS7835 is connected to a\n2kΩ x 2kΩ voltage divider. This divider allows the ADS7835\nto accept bipolar inputs while operating from a single 5Vsupply. The divider is connected to the output buffer of theinternal +2.5V supply. When the input is at +full-scale(+2.5V), the voltage at the input to the CDAC (CapacitiveDigital-to-Analog Converter) is also +2.5V resulting innegligible input current. When the input is at –full-scale(–2.5V), the voltage at the input of the CDAC is 0Vresulting in 1.25mA of current being sourced out of theinput pin. It is recommended that a buffer be placedbetween the analog input signal and the input of the ADS7835.\nThe input impedance of the ADS7835 depends on whetherthe device is in the sample or hold mode. When sampling,\nthe input has a 4k Ω input impedance to the reference. The\nsource of the analog input voltage must be able to charge theinput impedance (typically 25pF || 1k Ω) to a 12-bit settling\nlevel within the same period. This can be as little as 350nsin some operating modes. When the converter is in the holdmode, the input impedance switches to approximately 2k Ω\nto ground.\nCare must be taken regarding the input voltage on the A\nIN\npin. The input signal should remain within –5.3V and +5.3V\n(with a 5V supply) to avoid damaging the converter.\nREFERENCE\nThe reference voltage on the VREF pin directly sets the full-\nscale range of the analog input. The ADS7835 can operatewith a reference in the range of 2.3V to 2.9V, for a full-scalerange of ±2.3V to ±2.9V.\nThe voltage at the V\nREF pin is internally buffered and this\nbuffer drives the CDAC portion of the converter. This isimportant because the buffer greatly reduces the dynamicload placed on the reference source. However, the voltage atV\nREF will still contain some noise and glitches from the SAR\nconversion process. These can be reduced by carefullybypassing the V\nREF pin to ground as outlined in the sections\nthat follow.\nINTERNAL REFERENCE\nThe ADS7835 contains an on-board 2.5V reference, result-\ning in a –2.5V to +2.5V input range on the analog input. TheSpecification table gives the various specifications for theinternal reference. This reference can be used to supply asmall amount of source current to an external load, but theload should be static. Due to the internal 10k Ω resistor, a\ndynamic load will cause variations in the reference voltage,and will dramatically affect the conversion result. Note thateven a static load will reduce the internal reference voltageseen at the buffer input. The amount of reduction depends onthe load and the actual value of the internal “10k Ω” resistor.\nThe value of this resistor can vary by ±30%.\nThe V\nREF pin should be bypassed with a 0.1 µF capacitor\nplaced as close as possible to the ADS7835 package. Inaddition, a 2.2 µF tantalum capacitor should be used in\nparallel with the ceramic capacitor. Placement of this ca-pacitor, while not critical to performance, should be placedas close to the package as possible.\n1\n2348765+VCC\nCLK\nDATA\nCONVVREF\nAIN\nGND\nGNDADS7835 0.1µF+5V\n0.1µF1 0 µF\nSerial Clock\nfrom\nMicrocontrolleror DSPSerial Data\nConvert Start+\n2.2µF+\n–2.5V\nAnalog Input\nFIGURE 1. Basic Operation of the ADS7835.\n8 ADS7835®EXTERNAL REFERENCE\nThe internal reference is connected to the VREF pin and to the\ninternal buffer via a 10k Ω series resistor. Thus, the reference\nvoltage can easily be overdriven by an external referencevoltage. The voltage range for the external voltage is 2.3Vto 2.9V, corresponding to an analog input range of 2.3V to2.9V in both cases.\nWhile the external reference will not source significant\ncurrent into the V\nREF pin, it does have to drive the 10k Ω\nseries resistor that is terminated into the 2.5V internalreference (the exact value of the resistor will vary up to±30% from part to part). In addition, the V\nREF pin should\nstill be bypassed to ground with at least a 0.1 µF ceramic\ncapacitor (placed as close to the ADS7835 as possible). Thereference will have to be stable with this capacitive load.Depending on the particular reference and A/D conversionspeed, additional bypass capacitance may be required, suchas the 2.2 µF tantalum capacitor shown in Figure 1.\nReasons for choosing an external reference over the internal\nreference vary, but there are two main reasons. One is toachieve a given input range. The other is to provide greaterstability over temperature. (The internal reference is typi-cally 20ppm/ °C which translates into a full-scale drift of\nroughly one output code for every 12 °C. This does not take\ninto account other sources of full-scale drift.) If greaterstability over temperature is needed, then an external refer-ence with lower temperature drift will be required.\nDIGITAL INTERFACE\nFigure 2 shows the serial data timing and Figure 3 shows the\nbasic conversion timing for the ADS7835. The specifictiming numbers are listed in Table I. There are severalimportant items in Figure 3 which give the converter addi-tional capabilities over typical 8-pin converters. First, thetransition from sample mode to hold mode is synchronous tothe falling edge of CONV and is not dependent on CLK.Second, the CLK input is not required to be continuousduring the sample mode. After the conversion is complete,the CLK may be kept LOW or HIGH.\nThe asynchronous nature of CONV to CLK raises some\ninteresting possibilities, but also some design consider-ations. Figure 3 shows that CONV has timing restraints inrelation to CLK (t\nCKCH and tCKCS). However, if these times\nare violated (which could happen if CONV is completelyasynchronous to CLK), the converter will perform a conver-sion correctly, but the exact timing of the conversion isindeterminate. Since the setup and hold time between CONVand CLK has been violated in this example, the start ofconversion could vary by one clock cycle. (Note that thestart of conversion can be detected by using a pull-upresistor on DATA. When DATA drops out of high imped-ance and goes LOW, the conversion has started and that\nSYMBOL DESCRIPTION MIN TYP MAX UNITS\ntACQ Acquisition Time 350 ns\ntCONV Conversion Time 1.625 µs\ntCKP Clock Period 125 5000 ns\ntCKL Clock LOW 50 ns\ntCKH Clock HIGH 50 ns\ntCKDH Clock Falling to Current Data 5 15 ns\nBit No Longer Valid\ntCKDS Clock Falling to Next Data Valid 30 50 ns\ntCVL CONV LOW 40 ns\ntCVH CONV HIGH 40 ns\ntCKCH CONV Hold after Clock Falls(1)10 ns\ntCKCS CONV Setup to Clock Falling(1)10 ns\ntCKDE Clock Falling to DATA Enabled 20 50 ns\ntCKDD Clock Falling to DATA 70 100 ns\nHigh Impedance\ntCKSP Clock Falling to Sample Mode 5 ns\ntCKPDClock Falling to Power-Down Mode 50 ns\ntCVHD CONV Falling to Hold Mode 5 ns\n(Aperture Delay)\ntCVSP CONV Rising to Sample Mode 5 ns\ntCVPU CONV Rising to Full Power-up 50 ns\ntCVDD CONV Changing State to DATA 70 100 ns\nHigh Impedance\ntCVPD CONV Changing State to 50 ns\nPower-Down Mode\ntDRP CONV Falling to Start of CLK 5 µs\n(for hold droop < 0.1 LSB)\nNote: (1) This timing is not required under some situations.

If this occursfaster than the 10ns indicated by t\nCKCH, there is a chance that\nsome digital feedthrough may be coupled onto the holdcapacitor. This could cause a small offset error for thatparticular conversion.\nThus, there are two basic ways to operate the ADS7835.\nCONV can be synchronous to CLK and CLK can be con-tinuous. This would be the typical situation when interfacingthe converter to a digital signal processor. The secondmethod involves having CONV asynchronous to CLK andgating the operation of CLK (a non-continuous clock). Thismethod would be more typical of an SPI-like interface on amicrocontroller. This method would also allow CONV to begenerated by a trigger circuit and to initiate (after somedelay) the start of CLK. These two methods are coveredunder the DSP Interfacing and SPI Interfacing sections ofthis data sheet.\nPOWER-DOWN TIMING\nThe conversion timing shown in Figure 3 does not result in\nthe ADS7835 going into the power-down mode. If theconversion rate of the device is high (approaching 500kHz),there is very little power that can be saved by using thepower-down mode. However, since the power-down modeincurs no conversion penalty (the very first conversion isvalid) at lower sample rates, significant power can be savedby allowing the device to go into power-down mode be-tween conversions.\nFigure 4 shows the typical method for placing the A/D into\nthe power-down mode. If CONV is kept LOW during theconversion and is LOW at the start of the 13th clock cycle,the device enters the power-down mode. It remains in thismode until the rising edge of CONV. Note that CONV mustbe HIGH for at least t\nACQ in order to sample the signal\nproperly as well as to power-up the internal nodes.\nThere are two different methods for clocking the ADS7835.\nThe first involves scaling the CLK input in relation to theconversion rate. For example, an 8MHz input clock and thetiming shown in Figure 3 results in a 500kHz conversionrate. Likewise, a 1.6MHz clock would result in a 100kHzconversion rate. The second method involves keeping theclock input as close to the maximum clock rate as possibleand starting conversions as needed. This timing is similar tothat shown in Figure 4. As an example, a 50kHz conversionrate would require 160 clock periods per conversion insteadof the 16 clock periods used at 500kHz.\nThe main distinction between the two is the amount of time\nthat the ADS7835 remains in power-down. In the first mode,the converter only remains in power-down for a smallnumber of clock periods (depending on how many clockperiods there are per each conversion). As the conversionrate scales, the converter always spends the same percentageof time in power-down. Since less power is drawn by thedigital logic, there is a small decrease in power consump-tion, but it is very slight. This effect can be seen in the\nFIGURE 3. Basic Conversion Timing.D11\n(MSB)DATA\nNOTES: (1) Clock periods 14 and 15 are shown for clarity, but are not required for proper operation of the ADS7835, provided th at the\nminimum tACQ time is met. The CLK input may remain HIGH or LOW during this period. (2) The transition from sample mode to hold\nmode occurs on the falling edge of CONV. This transition is not dependent on CLK. (3) The device remains fully powered whenoperated as shown. If the sample time is longer than 3 clock periods, power consumption can be reduced by allowing the device t o\nenter a power-down mode.

As thetime between conversions get longer, the converter remainsin power-down an increasing percentage of time. This re-\nduces total power consumption by a considerable amount.For example, a 50kHz conversion rate results in roughly1/10 of the power (minus the reference) that is used at a\n11 ADS7835®500kHz conversion rate. HIGH.\nSHORT-CYCLE TIMING\nThe conversion currently in progress can be “short-cycled”\nwith the technique shown in Figure 6. This term means thatthe conversion will terminate immediately, before all 12 bitshave been decided. This can be a very useful feature whena resolution of 12 bits is not needed. An example would bewhen the converter is being used to monitor an input voltageuntil some condition is met. At that time, the full resolutionof the converter would then be used. Short-cycling theconversion can result in a faster conversion rate or lowerpower dissipation.\nThere are several very important items shown in Figure 6.\nThe conversion currently in progress is terminated whenCONV is taken HIGH during the conversion and then takenLOW prior to t\nCKCH before the start of the 13th clock cycle.\nNote that if CONV goes LOW during the 13th clock cycle,the LSB-first mode will be entered (Figure 5). Additionally,when CONV goes LOW, the DATA output immediatelytransitions to high impedance. If the output bit that is presentduring that clock period is needed, CONV must not go LOWuntil the bit has been properly latched into the receivingPOWER WITH POWER WITH\nfSAMPLE CLK = 16 • fSAMPLE CLK = 8MHz\n500kHz 17.5mW 17.5mW\n250kHz 16.5mW 13.5mW100kHz 15.5mW 10.5mW\nTABLE II.

This represents the\nmaximum amount of time between CONV going LOW andthe start of the conversion clock. Since CONV going LOWplaces the S/H in the hold mode and because the holdcapacitor loses charge over time, there is a requirement thattime t\nDRP be met as well as the maximum clock period\nD11\n(MSB)DATACLKCONV\nD10 D1D0\n(LSB)23 1 4 13 14 15 16 1 2 3\nD11\n(MSB)tACQ tDRP\nFIGURE 8.

Ideal Input Voltages and Output Codes.\nthe effects of offset, gain, or noise.\nDSP INTERFACING\n13 ADS7835®(tCKP).\nLAYOUT\nFor optimum performance, care should be taken with the\nphysical layout of the ADS7835 circuitry. This is particu-larly true if the CLK input is approaching the maximuminput rate.\nThe basic SAR architecture is sensitive to glitches or sudden\nchanges on the power supply, reference, ground connec-tions, and digital inputs that occur just prior to latching theoutput of the analog comparator. Thus, during any singleconversion for an n-bit SAR converter, there are n “win-dows” in which large external transient voltages can easilyaffect the conversion result. Such glitches might originatefrom switching power supplies, nearby digital logic, andhigh power devices. The degree of error in the digital outputdepends on the reference voltage, layout, and the exacttiming of the external event. The error can change if theexternal event changes in time with respect to the CLKinput.\nWith this in mind, power to the ADS7835 should be clean\nand well bypassed. A 0.1 µF ceramic bypass capacitor should\nbe placed as close to the device as possible. In addition, a1µF to 10µF capacitor is recommended. If needed, an evenlarger capacitor and a 5 Ω or 10Ω series resistor may be used\nto lowpass filter a noisy supply.\nThe ADS7835 draws very little current from an external\nreference on average as the reference voltage is internallybuffered. However, glitches from the conversion processappear at the V\nREF input and the reference source must be\nable to handle this. Whether the reference is internal orexternal, the V\nREF pin should be bypassed with a 0.1 µF\ncapacitor. An additional larger capacitor may also be used,if desired. If the reference voltage is external and originatesfrom an op amp, make sure that it can drive the bypasscapacitor or capacitors without oscillation.\nThe GND pin should be connected to a clean ground point.\nIn many cases, this will be the “analog” ground. Avoidconnections which are too near the grounding point of amicrocontroller or digital signal processor. If needed, run aground trace directly from the converter to the power supplyentry point. The ideal layout will include an analog groundplane dedicated to the converter and associated analogcircuitry.\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 13-Jul-2022\nPACKAGING INFORMATION\nOrderable Device Status\n(1)Package Type Package\nDrawingPinsPackage\nQtyEco Plan\n(2)Lead finish/\nBall material\n(6)MSL Peak Temp\n(3)Op Temp (°C) Device Marking\n(4/5)Samples\nADS7835E/250 ACTIVE VSSOP DGK 8250RoHS & Green Call TI Level-2-260C-1 YEAR -40 to 85 B35Samples\nADS7835E/250G4 ACTIVE VSSOP DGK 8250 TBD Call TI Call TI -40 to 85Samples\nADS7835E/2K5 ACTIVE VSSOP DGK 82500RoHS & Green Call TI Level-2-260C-1 YEAR B35Samples\nADS7835E/2K5G4 ACTIVE VSSOP DGK 82500RoHS & Green Call TI Level-2-260C-1 YEAR B35Samples\nADS7835EB/250 ACTIVE VSSOP DGK 8250RoHS & Green Call TI Level-2-260C-1 YEAR B35Samples\nADS7835EB/250G4 ACTIVE VSSOP DGK 8250RoHS & Green Call TI Level-2-260C-1 YEAR B35Samples\n \n(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:\nACTIVE: Product device recommended for new designs.\nLIFEBUY:  TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.\nNRND: Not recommended for new designs.
