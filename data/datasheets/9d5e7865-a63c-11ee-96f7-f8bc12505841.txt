It is primarily targeted for applications such as driving twisted-pair lines or any application where common \nmode injection is likely to occur. The input signal can be in \neither single-ended or differential form but the output is always in differential form.\nOn the EL5177, two feedback inputs provide the user with the \nability to set the device gain (stable at a minimum gain of 1).\nThe output common mode level is set by the reference pin \n(REF), which has a -3dB bandwidth of 110MHz. Generally, this \npin is grounded but it can be tied to any voltage reference.\nBoth outputs (OUT+, OUT-) are short circuit protected to \nwithstand temporary overload condition.\nThe EL5177 is available in the 10 Ld MSOP package and is \nspecified for operation over the full -40°C to +85°C \ntemperature range.\nSee also EL5174 (EL5177 in 8 Ld MSOP).Features\n• Fully differential inputs, outputs, and feedback\n• Differential input range ±2.3V• 550MHz 3dB bandwidth• 1100V/µs slew rate• Low distortion at 20MHz• Single 5V or dual ±5V supplies• 40mA maximum output current• Low power, 12.5mA typical supply current• Pb-free (RoHS compliant)\nApplications\n•T w i s t e d - p a i r  d r i v e r s• Differential line drivers• VGA over twisted-pair• ADSL/HDSL drivers• Single-ended to differential amplification• Transmission of analog signals in a noisy environment\nPinout\nEL5177\n(10 LD MSOP)\nTOP VIEW\n1\n2\n3\n410\n9\n8\n7FBP\nIN+\nREF\nIN-OUT+\nVS-\nVS+EN\n5 6 FBN OUT--+\nEL5177\nFN7344 Rev 6.00 Page 2 of 12\nAugust 28, 2012Pin Descriptions\nPIN NUMBER PIN NAME PIN DESCRIPTION\n1 FBP Non-inverting feedback input; resistor R F1 must be connected from this pin to V OUT\n2 IN+ Non-inverting input\n3 REF Output common-mode control; the common-mode voltage of V OUT will follow the voltage on this pin\n4 IN- Inverting input \n5 FBN Inverting feedback input; resistor R F2 must be connected from this pin to V OUT\n6 OUT- Inverting output\n7E N Enabled when this pin is floating or the applied voltage \uf0a3 VS+ -1.5\n8 VS+ Positive supply9 VS- Negative supply\n10 OUT+ Non-inverting output\nOrdering Information\nPART NUMBER\n(Notes 1, 2, 3)PART\nMARKINGPACKAGE\n(Pb-free)PKG.\nDWG. #\nEL5177IYZ BAAKA 10 Ld MSOP (3.0mm) M10.118A\nNOTES:\n1.

It can \nbe used as single/differential ended to differential converter. \nThe EL5177 is internally compensated for closed loop gain of +1 or greater. Connected in gain of 1 and driving a 1k \uf057 \ndifferential load, the EL5177 has a -3dB bandwidth of \n550MHz. Driving a 200 \uf057 differential load at gain of 2, the \nbandwidth is about 130MHz. The EL5177 is available with a \npower-down feature to reduce the power while the amplifier is \ndisabled.\nInput, Output, and Supply Voltage Range\nThe EL5177 has been designed to  operate with a single supply \nvoltage of 5V to 10V or a split  supplies with its total voltage \nfrom 5V to 10V. The amplifiers have an input common mode \nvoltage range from -4.3V to 3.4V for ±5V supply. The differential mode input range (DMIR) between the two inputs \nis from -2.3V to +2.3V. The input voltage range at the REF pin is \nfrom -3.3V to 3.7V. If the input common mode or differential mode signal is outside the above-specified ranges, it will cause \nthe output signal to become distorted. \nThe output of the EL5177 can sw ing from -3.8V to +3.8V at a \n1k\uf057 differential load at ±5V supply. As the load resistance \nbecomes lower, the output swing is reduced. \nDifferential and Common Mode Gain \nSettings\nThe voltage applied at REF pin can set the output common \nmode voltage and the gain is one. The differential gain is set \nby the R F and R G network.The gain setting for EL5177 is expressed in Equation 1:\nWhere:\nRF1 = R F2 = R F\nFIGURE 23.\nChoice of Feedback Resistor and Gain \nBandwidth Product\nFor applications that require a gain of +1, no feedback resistor is \nrequired. Just short the OUT+ pin to FBP pin and OUT- pin to FBN pin. For gains greater than +1, th e feedback resistor forms a pole \nwith the parasitic capacitance at the inverting input. As this pole \nbecomes smaller, the amplifier\'s phase margin is reduced. This causes ringing in the time domain and peaking in the frequency \ndomain. Therefore, R\nF has some maximum value that should not \nbe exceeded for optimum performance. If a large value of R F \nmust be used, a small capacitor in the few Pico farad range in \nparallel with R F can help to reduce the ringing and peaking at the \nexpense of reducing the bandwidth.REF\nR10 R9RCD\nRCDOUT+\nOUT-\nCC\nR6 R5CCR4 R3\nR7 R8R2 R1\nVB1 FBN FBP IN- IN+\nVB2VS+\nVS-\nVODMVIN\uf028 +VIN-\uf0291RF1RF2+\nRG----------------------------+\n\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0b4–=\nVODMVIN\uf028 +VIN-\uf02912RF\nRG-----------+\n\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0b4–=\nVOCMVREF=(EQ. 1)\nVO+FBP\nRG\nRF2IN+\nIN-\nREFFBNVIN+\nVIN-\nVREFRF1\nVO-\nEL5177\nFN7344 Rev 6.00 Page 10 of 12\nAugust 28, 2012The bandwidth of the EL5177 depends on the load and the \nfeedback network. R F and R G appear in parallel with the load for \ngains other than +1. As this combination gets smaller, the \nbandwidth falls off. Consequently, R F also has a minimum value \nthat should not be exceed ed for optimum bandwidth \nperformance. For gain of +1, R F = 0 is optimum. For the gains \nother than +1, optimum response is obtained with R F between \n500\uf057 to 1k\uf057. \nThe EL5177 has a gain bandwidth product of 200MHz for R LD = \n1k\uf057. For gains \uf0b35, its bandwidth can be predicted by Equation 2:\nDriving Capacitive Loads and Cables\nThe EL5177 can drive a 23pF differential capacitor in parallel \nwith a 1k \uf057 differential load with less than 5dB of peaking at gain \nof +1. If less peaking is desired in applications, a small series \nresistor (usually between 5 \uf057 to 50\uf057) can be placed in series with \neach output to eliminate most peaking. However, this will reduce \nthe gain slightly. If the gain setting is greater than 1, the gain resistor R\nG can then be chosen to make up for any gain loss \nwhich may be created by the additional series resistor at the \noutput. \nWhen used as a cable driver, double termination is always \nrecommended for reflection-free performance. For those \napplications, a back-termination se ries resistor at the amplifier\'s \noutput will isolate the amplifier from the cable and allow \nextensive capacitive drive. However, other applications may have \nhigh capacitive loads without a ba ck-termination resistor. Again, \na small series resistor at the outp ut can help to reduce peaking. \nDisable/Power-Down\nThe EL5177 can be disabled and its outputs placed in a high \nimpedance state. The turn-off time is about 1.2µs and the turn-on time is about 130ns. When di sabled, the amplifier\'s supply \ncurrent is reduced to 1.7µA for I\nS+ and 120µA for I S- typically, \nthereby effectively eliminatin g the power consumption. The \namplifier\'s power-down can be controlled by standard CMOS \nsignal levels at the EN pin. The ap plied logic signal is relative to \nVS+ pin. Letting the EN  pin float or applying a signal that is less \nthan 1.5V below V S+ will enable the amplifier. The amplifier will \nbe disabled when the signal at the EN  pin is above V S+ - 0.5V.\nOutput Drive Capability\nThe EL5177 has internal short circ uit protection. Its typical short \ncircuit current is ±40mA. If the output is shorted indefinitely, the power dissipation could easily incr ease such that the part will be \ndestroyed. Maximum reliability is maintained if the output \ncurrent never exceeds ±40mA. This limit is set by the design of the internal metal interconnect.\nPower Dissipation\nWith the high output drive capability of the EL5177, it is possible \nto exceed the +135°C absolute maximum junction temperature \nunder certain load current conditions. Therefore, it is important to calculate the maximum junction temperature for the \napplication to determine if the lo ad conditions or package types need to be modified for the amplifier to remain in the safe \noperating area.\nThe maximum power dissipation allowed in a package is \ndetermined according to Equation 3:\nWhere:\nT\nJMAX  = Maximum junction temperature\nTAMAX  = Maximum ambient temperature\n\uf071JA = Thermal resistance of the package\nThe maximum power dissipation actually produced by an IC is \nthe total quiescent supply current times the total power supply voltage, plus the power in the IC due to the load, or:\nWhere:\nV\nSTOT  = Total supply voltage = VS+ - VS-\nISMAX  = Maximum quiescent supply current per channel\n\uf044VO = Maximum differential output  voltage of the application\nRLD = Differential load resistance \nILOAD  = Load current\ni = Number of channels\nBy setting the two PD MAX equations equal to each other, we can \nsolve the output current and R LD to avoid the device overheat.\nPower Supply Bypassing and Printed Circuit \nBoard Layout\nAs with any high frequency device, a good printed circuit board \nlayout is necessary for optimum performance. Lead lengths \nshould be as short as possible. The power supply pin must be \nwell bypassed to reduce the risk of  oscillation. For normal single \nsupply operation, where the V S- pin is connected to the ground \nplane, a single 4.7µF tantalum ca pacitor in parallel with a 0.1µF \nceramic capacitor from V S+ to GND will suffice. This same \ncapacitor combination should be placed at each supply pin to \nground if split supplies are to be used. In this case, the V S- pin \nbecomes the negative supply rail.\nFor good AC performance, parasitic capacitance should be kept \nto a minimum. Use of wire-wound  resistors should be avoided \nbecause of their additional series inductance. Use of sockets \nshould also be avoided if po ssible. Sockets add parasitic \ninductance and capacitance that  can result in compromised \nperformance. Minimizing parasiti c capacitance at the amplifier\'s \ninverting input pin is very important. The feedback resistor \nshould be placed very close to the inverting input pin. Strip line design techniques are recommended for the signal traces.\nAs the signal is transmitted through a cable, the high frequency \nsignal will be attenuated. One wa y to compensate this loss is to \nboost the high frequency gain at the receiver side.Gain BW 200MHz =\uf0b4 (EQ. 2)PDMAXTJMAXTAMAX–\n\uf051JA-------------------------------------------- - =(EQ. 3)\n(EQ. 4) PD i VSTOTISMAX\uf0b4 V\uf028STOT\uf044VO\uf029–\uf044VO\nRLD------------\uf0b4 +\n\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0b4=\nFN7344 Rev 6.00 Page 11 of 12\nAugust 28, 2012EL5177\nIntersil products are manufactured, assembled and tested utilizing ISO9001 quality systems as noted\nin the quality certifications found at www.intersil.com/en/suppor t/qualandreliability.html\nIntersil products are sold by description on ly.
