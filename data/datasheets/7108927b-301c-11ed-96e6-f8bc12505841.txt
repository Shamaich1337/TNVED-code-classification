This \ntest fixture is designed to evaluat\ne the coupler in the same environment that is recommended for installation. \nEnclosed inside the test fixture, is a circuit board that is fabricated using the recommended footprint. The part being \ntested is placed into the test fixture and pressure is appli\ned to the top of the device using a pneumatic piston. A four \nport Vector Network Analyzer is connected to the fixture and is used to measure the S\n-\nparameters of the part. Worst \ncase values for each parameter are found and compared to the specification. The\nse worst case values are reported to \nthe test equipment operator along with a Pass or Fail flag. See the illustrations below.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30\n \ndB\n \nTest Board\n \nTest Board\n \nIn Fixture\n \nTest Station\n \n \n \n \n \nAvailable on Tape \nand Reel for Pick and \nPlace Manufacturing.\n \nUS\nA/Canada:\n \nToll Free:\n \nEurope\n:\n \n(315) 432\n-\n8909\n \n(800) 411\n-\n6596\n \n+44 2392\n-\n232392\n \n  \n  \nModel X\n3\nC\n1\n9P2\n-\n30S\n                         \nRev \nD\n \n \n \nThe effects of the test fixture on the measured data must be minimized in order to accurately determine the \nperfo\nrmance of the device under test. If the line impedance is anything other than 50\n\uf057\n \nand/or there is a \ndiscontinuity at the microstrip to SMA interface, there will be errors in the data for the device under test. The \ntest environment can never be “perfect”, b\nut the procedure used to build and evaluate the test boards \n(outlined below) demonstrates an attempt to minimize the errors associated with testing these devices. The \nlower the signal level that is being measured, the more impact the fixture errors will ha\nve on the data. \nParameters such as Return Loss and Isolation/Directivity, which are specified as low as 27dB and typically \nmeasure at much lower levels, will present the greatest measurement challenge.\n \n \nThe test fixture errors introduce an uncertainty to t\nhe measured data. Fixture errors can make the performance of the \ndevice under test look better or worse than it actually is. For example, if a device has a known return loss of 30dB and \na discontinuity with a magnitude of \n–\n35dB is introduced into the measu\nrement path, the new measured Return Loss \ndata could read anywhere between \n–\n26dB and \n–\n37dB. This same discontinuity could introduce an insertion phase \nerror of up to 1\n\uf0b0\n.\n \n \nThere are different techniques used throughout the industry to minimize the affects o\nf the test fixture on the \nmeasurement data. Anaren uses the following design and de\n-\nembedding criteria:\n \n \n\uf0b7\n \nTest boards have been designed and parameters specified to provide trace impedances of 50 \n\uf0b1\n1\n\uf057\n. Furthermore, discontinuities at the SMA to microstrip in\nterface are required to be less than \n–\n35dB and insertion phase errors (due to differences in the connector interface discontinuities \nand the electrical line length) should be less than \n\uf0b1\n0.25\n\uf0b0\n \nfrom the median value of the four \npaths.\n \n \n\uf0b7\n \nA “Thru” circuit board\n \nis built. This is a two port, microstrip board that uses the same SMA to \nmicrostrip interface and has the same total length (insertion phase) as the actual test board. The \n“Thru” board must meet the same stringent requirements as the test board. The inser\ntion loss \nand insertion phase of the “Thru” board are measured and stored. This data is used to \ncompletely de\n-\nembed the device under test from the test fixture. The de\n-\nembedded data is \navailable in S\n-\nparameter form on the Anaren website (www.anaren.com).\n \n \n \nNote\n:  The S\n-\nparameter files that are available on the anaren.com website include data for frequencies that are \noutside of the specified band. It is important to note that the test fixture is designed for optimum performance through \n2.3GHz. Some degradati\non in the test fixture performance will occur above this frequency and connector interface \ndiscontinuities of \n–\n25dB or more can be expected. This larger discontinuity will affect the data at frequencies above \n2.3GHz.\n \n \nCircuit Board Layout\n \n \nThe dimensions f\nor the Anaren test board are shown below. The test board is printed on Rogers RO4350 material \nthat is 0.030” thick.\n \nConsider the case when a different material is used. First, the pad size must remain the same to \naccommodate the part. But, if the material \nthickness or dielectric constant (or both) changes, the reactance at the \ninterface to the coupler will also change. Second, the linewidth required for 50\n\uf057\n \nwill be different and this will introduce \na step in the line at the pad where the coupler interfaces \nwith the printed microstrip trace. Both of these conditions will \naffect the performance of the part. \nTo achieve the specified performance, serious attention must be given to the \ndesign and layout of the circuit environment in which this component will be u\nsed.\n \n \nIf a different circuit board material is used, an attempt should be made to achieve the same interface pad reactance \nthat is present on the Anaren RO4350 test board. When thinner circuit board material is used, the ground plane will \nbe closer to the \npad yielding more capacitance for the same size interface pad. The same is true if the dielectric \nconstant of the circuit board material is higher than is used on the Anaren test board. In both of these cases, \nnarrowing the line before the interface pad wi\nll introduce a series inductance, which, when properly tuned, will \ncompensate for the extra capacitive reactance.

In this case, a wider section of line \nbefore the interface pad (or a larger interface pad) will introduce a shunt capacitance and when properly tuned will \nmatch the performance of the Anaren test board.\n \n \n \nNotice that the board layout for t\nhe 3dB and 5dB couplers is different from that of the 10dB and 20dB couplers. The \ntest board for the 3dB and 5dB couplers has all four traces interfacing with the coupler at the same angle. The test \nboard for the \n30dB, \n10dB and 20dB couplers has two traces\n \napproaching at one angle and the other two traces at a \ndifferent angle. \nThe entry angle of the traces has a significant impact on the RF performance and these parts \nhave been optimized for the layout used on the test boards shown below.\n \n \n \n \n30\ndB Test Boar\nd\n \n \nTesting Sample Parts Supplied on Anaren Test Boards\n \n \nIf you have received a coupler installed on an Anaren produced microstrip test board, please remember to remove the \nloss of the test board from the measured data.

When the loss of the test board is removed, the coupling at F1 becomes \n-\n10.18dB (\n-\n10.30dB + \n0.12dB)\n. This compensation must be made to both the coupled and direct path measurements when calculating \ninsertion loss.\n \n \nThe loss estimates in the table above come from room temperature measurements.

A b\nasic feed\n-\nforward schematic is shown in Figure ap.n.2\n-\n1.  The input signal \nis split in two using a hybrid coupler or power divider.  The output of the main amplifier is sampled with a 20dB\n-\n30dB \ndirectional coupler.  The \nX3C19\nP2\n-\n30S\n \nis an excellent candidat\ne for this sampling since it provides great return loss and \ndirectivity.  The sampled signal, which consists of a sample of the original input signal plus some distortion, is inverted \nand then combined with the output of the first delay line.  This procedu\nre subtracts (through destructive interference) the \nsample of the original input signal, leaving only the distortion or error component.  The error component is then \namplified and combined with the output of the second delay line using another directional \ncoupler.  In many cases, a \n10dB coupler is used to combine the two signals.  The XC\n09\n00E\n-\n10 is a perfect choice for this injection because it has \ntight coupling, superior directivity, and excellent match.   \n \n \n \n \n \nAvailable on Tape \nand Reel for Pick and \nPlace Manufacturing.\n \nUS\nA/Canada:\n \nToll Free:\n \nEurope\n:\n \n(315) 432\n-\n8909\n \n(800) 411\n-\n6596\n \n+44 2392\n-\n232392\n \n  \n  \nModel X\n3\nC\n1\n9P2\n-\n30S\n                         \nRev \nD\n \n \n \n \n*Recommended Terminations\n \nPower (Watts)\n \nMode\nl\n \n8\n \nRFP\n-\n \n060120A15Z50\n-\n2\n \n10\n \nRFP\n-\n \nC10A50Z4\n \n16\n \nRFP\n-\n \nC16A50Z4\n \n20\n \nRFP\n-\n \nC20N50Z4\n \n50\n \nRFP\n-\n \nC50A50Z4\n \n100\n \nRFP\n-\n \nC100N50Z4\n \n200\n \nRFP\n-\n \nC200N50Z4\n \n \n \nFigure ap.n.2\n-\n1.
