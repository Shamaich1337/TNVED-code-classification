A cermet film  \nlayer and a glass-over are de posited on a high grade (Al 2O3) \nceramic substrate with its prepared inner contacts. A  \nspecial laser is used to achiev e the target value by smoothly  \nfine trimming the resistive layer without damaging the  \nceramics. The resistor elements are covered by a protective  \ncoating designed for electrical, mechanical and climatic  \nprotection. The terminations receiv e a final pure tin on nickel  \nplating.  \nThe result of the determined production is verified by an  \nextensive testing procedure on 100 % of the individual chip  \nresistors. Only accepted pro ducts are laid directly into  \nthe tape in accordance with IEC 60286-3 Type 1a and  \nType 2a (1).\nASSEMBLY\nThe resistors are suitable for processing on automatic SMD  \nassembly systems. They are suitable for automatic  \nsoldering using wave, reflow or vapor phase as shown in  \nIEC 61760-1 (1). The encapsulation is resistant to all  \ncleaning solvents commonly used in the electronics  \nindustry, including alcohols, esters and aqueous solutions.  \nThe suitability of conformal coatings, potting compounds  \nand their processes, if app lied, shall be qualified by  \nappropriate means to ensure th e long-term stability of the  \nwhole system.The resistors are RoHS-compl iant, the pure tin plating  \nprovides compatibility with  lead (Pb)-free and  \nlead-containing soldering processes. Solderability is  \nspecified for 2 years after produ ction or requalification. The  \npermitted storage time is 20 years. The immunity of the  \nplating against tin whisker gr owth has been proven under  \nextensive testing.MATERIALS\nVishay acknowledges the following systems for the  \nregulation of hazardous substances:• IEC 62474, Material Declaration for Products of and for the  \nElectrotechnical Industry, with the list of declarable  \nsubstances given therein \n(2)\n• The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List  \n(GADSL) (3)\n• The REACH regulation (1907/2006/EC) and the related list  \nof substances with very high concern (SVHC) (4) for its  \nsupply chain\nThe products do not contain any of the banned  \nsubstances as per IEC 62474, GADSL, or the SVHC list,  \nsee www.vishay.com/how/leadfree .\nHence the products fully comply with the following  \ndirectives:• 2000/53/EC End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (ELV) and  \nAnnex II (ELV II)\n• 2011/65/EU Restriction of the Use of Hazardous  \nSubstances Directive (RoHS) with amendment  \n2015/863/EU\n• 2012/19/EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment  \nDirective (WEEE)\nVishay pursues the elimination of conflict minerals from its  \nsupply chain, see the Conflict Minerals Policy at  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?49037\n.\nAPPROVALS\nThe resistors are qualified according to AEC-Q200.Where applicable, the resistors are tested in accordance  \nwith EN 140401-802  which refers to EN 60115-1 , \nEN 60115-8  and the variety of environmental test  \nprocedures of the IEC 60068 \n(1) series.\nRELATED PRODUCTS\nFor more information about products with better TCR and  \ntighter tolerance please refer to the “Lead (Pb)-Free Thick  \nFilm, Rectangular, Semi-P recision Chip Resistors”  \ndatasheet ( www.vishay.com/doc?20036 ).\nThe D/CRCW with SnPb termination plating is designed for  \napplications where lead bearing terminations are  \nmandatory.
