The \ninput pins can also be driven from a single -ended source. The \npeak differential input is ±2 V , allowing sine wave operation at  \n1 V rms with generous headroom. T he output pins can drive \nsingle -sided loads essentially rail -to-rail. The differential output \nresistance is 150  Ω. The output swing is a linear function of the \nvoltage applied to the VMAG pin that internally defaults to 0. 5 V, \nproviding a peak output of ±2  V. This can be raised to 10 V p -p, \nlimited by the supply voltage.  \nThe basic gain function is linear -in-dB, controlled by the voltage \napplied to Pin VDBS. The gain ranges from 0 dB to 50 dB for \ncontrol voltages between 0 V and 1.5 V —a slope of 30 mV /dB. \nThe gain linearity is typically within ±0.1 dB. By changing the logic level on Pin MODE, the gain decreases over the same range,  \nwith an opposite slope. A second gain control port is provided at the VMAG pin and allows the user to vary the numeric gain from a factor of 0.03 to 10. All the parameters of the AD8330 have low sensitivities to temperature and supply voltages.  Using \nVMAG, the basic 0 dB to 50 dB range can  be reposi tioned to \nany value from 20 dB higher (that is, 20 dB to 70 dB) to at least 30 dB lower (that is, –30 dB to +20 dB) to suit the application, \nthereby providing  an unprece dented gain range of over 100  dB. \nA unique aspect of the AD8330 is that its bandwidth and pulse \nresponse are essentially constant for all gains, over both the basic 50 dB linear -in-dB range, but also when using the linear -\nin-magnitude function. The exceptional stability o f the HF \nresponse over the gain range is of particular value in those VGA applications where it is essential to maintain accurate gain law-\nconformance at high frequencies.  \nAn external capacitor at Pin OFST sets the high -pass corner of  \nan offset reduction loop, whose frequency can be as low as 5  Hz. \nWhen th is pin is grounded, the signal path becomes dc -coupled.  \nWhen u sed to drive an ADC, an external common -mode control \nvoltage at Pin CNTR can be driven to within 0.5 V of either ground  \nor V\nS to accommodate a  wide variety of requirements. By default, \nthe two outputs are positioned at the midpoint of the supply, V S/2. \nOther features, such as two levels of power -down (fully off and \na hibernate mode), further extend the practical value of this excep tionally vers atile VGA.  \nThe AD8330 is available in 16 -lead LFCSP and 16 -lead QSOP \npackages and is specified for operation from −40°C to +85°C.  \n \nAD8330 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

H | Page 15 of 32 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION  \nMany monolithic variable gain amplifiers use techniques that \nshare common principles that are  broadly classified as translinear. \nThis term refers to circuit cells whose functions depend directly on the very predictable properties of bipolar junction transistors, notably the linear dependence of their transconductance on collector \ncurrent. Since th e discovery of these cells in 1967, and their \ncommercial exploitation in products developed during the early \n1970s, accurate wide bandwidth analog multipliers, dividers, and variable gain amplifiers have invariably employed  translinear \nprinciples.  \nAlthough  these techniques are well understood, the realization \nof a high performance variable gain amplifier (VGA) requires special technologies and attention to many subtle details in its design. The AD8330 is fabricated on a proprietary silicon -on-\ninsulator, complementary bipolar IC process and draws on decades of experience in developing many leading edge products  \nusing translinear principles to provide an unprecedented  level of \nversatility.  \nFigure 45 shows a basic representative cell comprising just four \ntransistors. This, or a very closely related form, is at the heart of most tra nslinear multipliers, dividers, and VGAs. The key concepts  \nare as follows:  \nFirst, the ratio of the currents in the left- hand and right -hand \npairs of transistors is identical, rep resented by the modulation \nfactor, x, with values between −1 and +1. Second, the input signal is arranged to  modulate the fixed tail current, I\nD, to cause \nthe variable value of x, introduced in the left -hand pair, to be \nreplicated in the right -hand pair, and, thus, generate the output \nby modulating its nominally fixed tail current, I N. Third, the \ncurrent gain of  this cell is exactly G = I N/ID over many decades \nof variable bias current.  \nIn practice, the realization of the full potential of this circuit involves many other factors, but these three elementary ideas remain essential.  \nBy varying I\nN, the overall funct ion is that of a two -quadrant \nanalog multiplier, exhibiting a linear relationship to both the signal modulation factor (x) and this numerator current. On  \nthe other hand, by varying I\nD, a two -quadrant analog divider  \nis realized, having a hyperbolic gain f unction with respect to  \nthe input factor, x, controlled by this denominator current. The \nAD8330 exploits both modes of operation. However, because  a \nhyperbolic gain function is generally of less value than one in \nwhich the decibel gain is a linear function of a control input, a special interface is included to provide either increasing or decreasing exponential control of I\nD.

Block Schematic  \nOverall Structure  \nFigure 46 shows a block schematic of the AD 8330 locating the \nkey sections. More detailed descriptions of its structure and \nfeatures are provided throughout the Theory of Operation  \nsection; however, Figure 46 provides a general overview of its \ncapabilities.  \nThe VGA core contains a more elaborate version of the cell \nshown in Figure 45. The current, I D, is controlled exponentially \n(linear -in-decibels) through the decibel gain interface at \nPin VDBS and its local common, Pin CMGN. The gain span \n(that is, th e decibel difference between maximu m and minimum  \nvalues) provided by this control function is slightly more than \n50 dB. The absolute gain from input to output is a function of source and load impedance, and  depends on the voltage on a \nsecond gain control pin (VMAG), explained in the Normal Operating Conditions  section.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAD8330  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. H | Page 16 of 32 Normal Operating Conditions  \nTo minimize confusion, normal operating conditions are \ndefined as follows:  \n• The input pins are vo ltage driven (the source im pedance is \nassumed to be zero) . \n• The output pins are open circuited (the load impeda nce is \nassumed to be infinite) . \n• Pin VMAG is unconnected setting up the output bias current (I\nN in the four -transistor gain cell) to its nominal \nvalue. \n• Pin CMGN is grounded . \n• MODE is either tied to a logic high or left unconnected, to \nset the up gain mode.  \nThe effects of other operating conditions are considered \nseparately.  \nThroughout this data sheet, the end -to-end voltage gain for the \nnormal operat ing conditions is referred to as the basic gain. \nUnder these conditions, it runs from 0 dB when V DBS = 0 V \n(where this voltage is more exactly measured with reference to \nPin CMGN, which is not necessarily tied to ground) up to 50  dB \nfor V DBS = 1.5 V . The gain does not fold over when the VDBS \npin is driven below ground or above its nominal full -scale value.  \nThe input is accepted at the INHI/INLO  differential port . These \npins are internally biased to roughly the midpoint of the supply, \nVS (it is actually ~2.7 5 V for V S =  5  V,  V DBS = 0 V, and 1.5  V for \nVS = 3 V), but the AD8330 is able to accept a forced common -\nmode value, from zero to V S, with certain limitations. This interface  \nprovides good common -mode rejection up to high frequencies \n(see Figure 16) and, thus, can be driven in either a single -sided \nor differential manner. However, operati on using a differential \ndrive is preferable, and this is assumed in the specifications, \nunless otherwise stated.  \nThe pin -to-pin input resistance is specified as 950 Ω ± 20%. The \ndriving -point impedance of the signal source can range from \nzero up to values considerably in excess of this resistance, with a \ncorresponding variation in noise figure (see Figure 53). In most \ncases, the input is coupled via two capacitors, cho sen to provide \nadequate low frequency transmission. This results in the  mini mum \ninput noise that increases when some other common -mode volt -\nage is forced onto these pins. The short -circuit, input -referred \nnoise at maximum gain is approximately 5 nV/√Hz.  \nOutput Pin OPHI and Output Pin OPLO operate at a common -\nmode voltage at the midpoint of the supply, V S/2, within a few \nmillivolts. This ensures that an analog- to-digital converter (ADC) \nattached to these outputs operates within the often narrow range permit ted by their design. When a common- mode voltage \nother than V\nS/2 is required at this interface, it can easily be forced  \nby applying an externally provided voltage to the output centering  \npin, CNTR. This voltage can run from zero to the full supply, though t he use of such extreme values leaves only a small range \nfor the differential output signal swing.  The differential impedance measured between OPHI and OPLO  is \n150 Ω ± 20%. It follows that both the gain and the full -scale \nvoltage swing depend on the load im pedance; both are nominally  \nhalved when this is also 150 Ω. A fixed impedance output interface, rather than an op amp style voltage -mode output, is \npreferable in high speed applications because the effects of complex reactive loads on the gain and phase ca n be better controlled. \nThe top end of the AD8330 ac response is optimally flat for a 12 pF \nload on each pin, but this is not critical , and the system remains \nstable for any value of load capacitance including zero.  \nAnother useful feature of this VGA in connection with the driving of an ADC is that the peak output magnitude can be precisely controlled by the voltage on Pin VMAG. Usually, this \nvoltage is internally preset to 500  mV , and the peak differential \nunloaded output swing is ±2 V ± 3%. However, any voltage from zero to at least 5 V can be applied to this pin to alter the peak output in an exactly proportional way. Because either out put \npin can swing rail -to-rail, which in practice means down to at \nleast 0.35 V and to within the same voltage below the supply, the  \npeak -to-peak output between these pins can be as high as 10 V \nusing V\nS =  6  V.  \nINHI\nINLO\nVDBSVPSI\nCOMMTRANSIMPEDANCE\nOUTPUT STAGE\n500Ω500Ω\nLINEAR-IN-dB\nINTERFACE MAGNITUDEINTERFACE\n5kΩR\nOUT =150Ω\n100µA\nVMAGVPSO\nOPHI\nOPLOΔV = 0\n12.65 µA–4mA OR\n4mA–12.65 µA\nCOMMVMAGMODECNTRΔV = 0\nO/P CM-MOD E\nNORMALLY\nAT VP/2CM MODEFEEDBACK\nV\nDBS\n03217-048 \nFigure 47. Schemat ic of Key Components  \nLinear -in-dB Gain Control (V DBS) \nAll Analog Devices, Inc., VGAs featuring a linear -in-dB gain \nlaw, such as the X -AMP® family, provide exact, constant gain \nscaling over the fully specified gain range, and the deviation from the ideal response is within a small fraction of a dB. For the AD8330, the scaling of both of its gain interfaces is \nsubstantially independent of process, supply voltage, or temperature. The basic gain, G\nB, is simply  \n()\nmV30DBS\nBVdBG=  (1) \nwhere VDBS is in volts.  \n \n \nData Sheet  AD8330  \n \nRev. H | Page 17 of 32 Alternatively, this can be expressed as a numerical gain \nmagnitude  \nVV\nBNDBS\nG6.010=  (2) \nThe gain can be increased or decreased by changing the voltage, V\nMAG, applied to the VMAG pin. The internally set default value \nof 500 mV is derived from the same band gap reference that \ndetermines the decibel scaling. The tolerance on this voltage, and mismatches in certain on- chip resistors, cause small gain \nerrors (see the Specifications  section). Though not all applications  \nof VGAs demand accurate gain calibration, it is a valuable asset in many situations, for example, in reducing design tolerances.  \nFigure 47 shows the core circuit in more detail. The range and \nscaling of V\nDBS is independent of the supply voltage, and the gain \ncontrol pin, VDBS , presents a high incremental input resistance \n(~100 MΩ) with a low bias current (~100 nA), making the AD8330 easy to drive from a variety of gain control sources.  \nInversion of the Gain Slope  \nThe AD8330 supports many features that further extend the \nversatility of this VGA in wide bandwidth gain control systems. For example, the logic pin, MODE , allows the slope of the gain \nfunction to be i nverted, so that the basic gain starts at +50 dB \nfor a gain voltage, V\nDBS, of zero and runs down to 0 dB when \nthis voltage is at its maximum specified value of 1.5 V . The basic forms of these two gain control modes are shown in Figure  48. \n0.251020\nVDBS (V)GAIN (dB)\n0304050\n0 0.50 0.75 1.0 1.25 1.50MODE PIN\nLOW, GAIN\nDECREASES\nWITH VDBSMODE PIN\nHIGH, GAIN\nINCREASES\nWITH VDBS\n03217-049 \nFigure 48. Two Gain Directions of the AD8330  \nGain Magnitude Control (V MAG) \nIn addition to the bas ic linear -in-dB control, two more gain \ncontrol features are provided. The voltage applied to Pin VMAG provides accurate linear -in-magnitude gain control with a very \nrapid response. The bandwidth of this interface is >100 MHz. When this pin is unconnected, V\nMAG assumes its default value of \n500 mV (see Figure 47) to set up the basic 0 dB to 50 dB range. \nHowever, any voltage from ~15 mV to 5 V can be applied either to lower the gain by up to 30 dB or to raise it by 20 dB. The \ncombined gain span is thus 100 dB, that is, the 50 dB basic gain span provided by V\nDBS plus a 60 dB linear -in-magnitude span provided by V MAG. The latter modifies the basic numerical gain \nGBN to generate a total gain, ex pressed here in magnitude terms.  \nV5.0MAG\nBN TVG G=  (3) \nUsing this to calculate the output voltage , \nVOUT = 2 × G IN × V IN × V MAG  (4) \nfrom which it is apparent that the AD8330 implements a linear, \ntwo-quadrant multiplier with a bipolar V IN and a unipolar V MAG. \nBecause the AD8330 is a dc -coupled system, it can be used in \nmany applications where a wideband two -quad rant multiplier \nfunction is required, from dc up to about 100 MHz from either input (V\nIN or V MAG).  \nAs V MAG is varied, so also is the peak output magnitude, up to a \npoint where this is limited by the absolute output limit imposed by the supply voltage. In the absence of the latter effect, the peak output into an open -circuited load is just  \nV\nOUT_PK  = ±4 V MAG (5) \nwhereas for a load resistance of R L directly across OPHI and \nOPLO, it is  \n()1502\n_+±=\nLL MAG\nPK OUTRR VV  (6) \nThese capabilities are illustrated in Figure 49, where V S =  6  V,   \nRL = O/C, V DBS =  0  V,  V IN is swept from −2.5 V dc to +2.5 V dc,  and \nVMAG is set to 0.25 V , 0.5 V , 1 V , and 2 V . Except for the last value \nof V MAG, the peak output follows Equation 5. This exceeds the \nsupply -limited value when V MAG = 2 V and the peak output is \n±5.65 V , that is, ±6 V − 0.35 V . Figure 50 demonstrates the high \nspeed multiplication capability. The signal input is a 100  MHz, \n0.1 V sine wave, V DBS is set to 0.6 V , and V MAG is a square wave at \n5 MHz alternating from 0.25 V to 1 V . The output is ideally a sine wave switching in amplitude between 0. 5 V  a n d  2  V.   \nVIN ( V)8\n3 1 2– 3–VOUT (V)4\n0\n–4\n–8\n–16\n2\n–2\n–6\n0 2VMAG = 2V\n1V\n0.5V\n0.25V\n03217-050 \nFigure 49.

Using VMAG in Modulation Mode  \nAnother gain related feature allows both gain control ranges  \nto be accurately raised by 200 mV . To enable this offset, open circuit CMGN (Pin 6, LFCSP; Pin 8, QSO P) and add a 0.1 µ F \ncapacitor to ground. In use, the nominal range for V\nDBS extends \nfrom 0.2 V to 1.7 V and V MAG from 0.2 V to 5.2 V . These \nspecifications apply for any supply voltage. This allows the use \nof DACs whose output range does not include ground as source s \nfor the gain control function(s).  \nNote that the 200 mV that appears on this pin affects the response to an externally applied V\nMAG, but when Pin  VMAG is \nunconnected, the internally set default value of 0.5 V still applies.  \nFurthermore, Pin CMGN can, if desired, be driven by a user -\nsupplied voltage to reposition the baseline for V DBS (or for an \nexternally applied V MAG) to any other voltage up to 50 0 m V.  I n  \nall cases, the gain scaling, its law conformance, and temperature stability are unaffected.  \nTwo Classes of Variable Gain Amplifiers  \nNote that there are two broad classes of VGAs. The first type is designed to cope with a very wide range of input a mplitudes \nand, by virtue of its gain control function, compress this range down to an essentially constant output. This is the function needed in an AGC system. Such a VGA is called an IVGA, \nreferring to a structure optimized to address a wide range of \ninput amplitudes. By contrast, an OVGA is optimized to deliver \na wide range of output values while operating with an essentially  \nconstant input amplitude. This function might be needed, for \nexample, in providing a variable drive to a power amplifier.  \nIt is a pparent from the foregoing sections that the AD8330 is \nboth an IVGA and an OVGA in one package. This is an unusual and possibly confusing degree of versatility  for a VGA; therefore,  \nthese two dist inct control functions are described at separate \npoints throughout this data sheet to explain the operation and applications of this product. It is, nevertheless, useful to briefly describe the capabilities of these features when used together.  \n Amplitude/ Phase Response  \nThe ac response of the AD8330 is remarkably consistent not \nonly over the full 50 dB of its basic gain range, but also with changes of gain due to alteration of V\nMAG, as demonstrated  in \nFigure 51. This is an overlay of two sets of results: first , with a \nvery low V MAG of 16 mV that reduces the overall gain by 30  dB \n[20 × log10(500 mV/16 mV)]; secon d, with V MAG = 5 V that \nincreases the gain by 20 dB = 20 × log10(5 V/0.5 V).  \nFREQUENCY (Hz)90\n100k\n10kGAIN (dB)30\n–10\n–35050\n10\n–30\n1M 10M 100M 300M70PHASE (Degrees)–50\n–50\n–100\n–150\n–200\n–250\n–3000\nG = +70dB\nG = –20dB\n100k 1M 10M 100M300M\n03217-052 \nFigure 51. AC Performance over a 100 dB Gain Range Obtained by  \nUsing Two Values of V MAG \nThis 50 dB step change in gain produces two sets of gain curves, having a total gain span of 100 dB. It is apparent that the ampli -\ntude and phase response are essentially independent of the gain over this wide range, an aspect of the AD8330 performance \npotential unprecedented in any prior VGA.  \nIt is unusual for an application to require such a wide range of gains; and , as a practical matter, the peak output voltage for \nV\nMAG = 16 mV is reduced by the factor 16/500, compared to its \nnominal value of ±2 V , t o only ±64 mV . As previously  noted, \nmost applications of VGAs require that they operate in a mode \nthat is predominantly of either an IVGA or OVGA style, rather than mixed modes.  \nWith this limitation in mind, and simply to illustrate the unusual possibiliti es afforded by the AD8330, note  that, with \nappropriate drive to V\nDBS and V MAG in tandem, the gain span is a \nremarkable 120 dB, extending from −50 dB to +70 dB, as shown \nin Figure 52 for operation at 1 MHz and 100 MHz. In this case, \nVDBS and V MAG are driven from a common control voltage, \nVGAIN, that varies from 1.2 mV to 5 V , with 30% (1.5/5) of V GAIN \napplied to  VDBS, and 100% applied to V MAG. \nThe gain varies in a linear -in-dB manner with V DBS, although \nthe response from V MAG is linear -in-magnitude. Consequently, the \noverall numerical gain as the product of these two functions is  \nV6.0103.0V5.0/GAINV\nGAINV GAIN ×× = (7) \nIn rare cases where such a wide gain range is of value, the \ncalibration is still accurate and the temperature is stable. \nData Sheet  AD8330 \nRev.

Gain Control Function and Input Referred Noise Spectral Density \nover a 120 dB Range  \nNoise, Input Cap acity, and Dynamic Range  \nThe design of variable gain amplifiers invariably incurs some \ncompromises in noise performance. However, the structure of \nthe AD8330 is such that this penalty is minimal. Examination  \nof the simplified schematic ( Figure 47) shows that the input \nvoltage is converted to current -mode form by the two 500 Ω \nresistors at Pin INHI and Pin INLO, whose combined Johnson noise contributes 4.08 nV/√Hz. The total input noise at full gain, when driven from a low impedance source, is typically 5 nV/√Hz after accounting for the voltage and current noise \ncontributi ons of the loop amplifier. For a 200 kHz channel \nbandwidth, this amounts to 2.24 μV rms. The peak input at full gain is ±6.4 mV , or +4.5 mV rms for a sine wave signal. The signal- to-noise ratio at full input, that is, the dynamic range, for \nthese conditions is, thus, 20 log10(4.5 mV/2.24 μV), or 66 dB. The value of V\nMAG has essentially no effect on the input referred \nnoise, but it is assumed to be 0.5 V .  \nBelow midgain (25 dB, V DBS = 0.75 V), noise in the output \nsection dominates, and the total input noise i s 11 nV/√Hz, or \n4.9 µV rms in a 200 kHz bandwidth, and the peak input is 78 mV rms. Thus, the dynamic range increases to 84 dB.  \nAt minimum gain, the input noise is up to 120 nV/√Hz, or 53.7 mV rms in the assumed 200 kHz bandwidth, while the \ninput capacity  is ±2 V , or +1.414 V rms (sine), a dynamic range \nof 88.4 dB. In calculating the dynamic range for other channel bandwidths, ∆f, subtract 10 log10(∆f/200 kHz) from these illustrative values. A system operating with a 2 MHz bandwidth, for example, exhibits dynamic range values that are uniformly \n10 dB lower; used in an audio application with a 20 kHz band -\nwidth, they are 10 dB higher.  \nNoise figure is a misleading metric for amplifiers that are not \nimpedance matched at their input, which is the special condi -\ntion resulting only when both the voltage and current components  \nof a signal, that is, the signal power, are used at the input port. When a source of impedance (R\nS) is terminated using a resistor \nof R S (a condition that is not to be confused with matching) , \nonly one of these components is used, either the current (as in the AD8330 ) or the voltage. Then, even if the amplifier is perfect, t he noise  figur e cannot be better t han 3 dB.

Dynamic Range in dB/√Hz vs. V DBS (V MAG = 0.5 V, 1 V rms Output) \nCompared with a Representative X -AMP (Simulation)  \nDynamic Range  \nThe ratio of peak output swing, expressed in rms terms, to the \noutput -referred noise spectral density provides a measure of \ndynamic range, in dB/√Hz. For a certain class of variable gain \namplifiers, exemplified by the Analog Devices X -AMP ® family, \nthe dynamic range is essentially independent of the gain setting because the peak output swing and noise are both constant. The AD8330 provides a different dynamic range profile because  \nthere is n o longer a constant  relationship between these two  \nparameters.

H | Page 20 of 32 critical. This objec tive is complicated by the fact that the \ncommon -mode level varies with the basic gain voltage, V DBS. \nFigure 55 shows this relationship for a supply voltage of 5 V , fo r \ntemperatures of −40°C, +25°C, and +85°C. Figure 56 shows the \ninput noise spectral density (R S = 0) vs. the input common -\nmode voltage, for V DBS = 0.5 V , 0.6 V , 0.75 V , and 1.5 V . It is \napparent that there is a broad range over which the noise is \nunaffected by this dc level.

Input Noise vs. Common -Mode Input Voltage for  \nVDBS = 0.5 V, 0.6 V, 0.75 V, and 1.5 V  \nOutput Noise a nd Peak Swing  \nThe output noise of the AD8330  is the input noise multiplied by \nthe overall gain, including any optional change to the voltage, V\nMAG, applied to Pin VMAG. The peak output swing is also \nproportional to this voltage, which, at low gains and high values of V\nMAG, affects the output noise.  \nThe scaling for V DBS = 0 V is as follows:  \nVOUT_PK  = ±4 V MAG  (8) \nVNOISE_OUT  = (85 + 70 V MAG) nV/√Hz  (9) \n \n For example, using a reduced value of V MAG = 0.25 V that lowers all \ngain values by 6 dB, the peak output swing is ±1 V (differentially)  \nand the output noise spectral density evaluates to 102.5  nV/√Hz.  \nThe peak output swing is no different at full gain, but the noise \nbecomes  \nVNOISE_OUT  = (0.1 + 0.32 V MAG) µV/√Hz  (10) \nfor R S = 0 and V DBS = 1.5 V , assuming an input noise of 5 nV/√Hz. \nThe output noise for very small values of V MAG (at or below 15  mV) \nis not precise, partly because the small input offset associated \nwith this interface has a large effect on  the gain.  \nOffset Compensation  \nThe AD8330 includes an offset compensation feature that is \noperational in the default condition (no connection to Pin  OFST). \nThis loop introduces a high- pass filter function into the signal \npath, whose −3 dB corner frequency is at  \n()HP INTHPFCRfπ=21\n (11) \nwhere :  \nCHP is the external capacitance added from OFST to CNTR . \nRINT is an internal resistance of approximately 480 Ω, having a \nmaximum uncertainty of about ±20% .  \nThis evaluates to  \nHPHPFCfµ=330\n(C HP in μF)  (12) \nA small amount of peaking at this corner when using small \ncapacitor values can be avoided by adding a series resistor. \nUseful combinations are C HP = 3 nF, R HP = 180 Ω,  f = 100 kHz; \nCHP = 33 nF, R HP = 10 Ω, f = 10 kHz; C HP = 0.33 μF, R HP = 0 Ω,  \nf = 1 kHz; C HP = 3.3 μF, R HP = 0 Ω, f = 100 Hz.  \nThe offset compensation feature can be disabled simply by grounding the OFST pin. This provides a dc -coupled signal \npath, with no other effects on the overall  ac response. Input \noffsets must be externally nulled in this mode of operation, as shown in Figure 58. \nEffects of Loading on Gain and AC Response  \nThe differential ou tput impedance (R O) is 150 Ω, and the fre -\nquency response of the output stage is optimized for operation with a certain load capacitance on each output pin (OPHI and OPLO) to ground, in combination with a load resistance (R\nL) \ndirectly across these pins. In  the absence of these capacitances, \nthere is a small amount of peaking at the top extremity of the ac response. Suitable combinations are: R\nL = ∞, C L = 12 pF; R L = \n150 Ω, C L = 25 pF; R L = 75 Ω, C L = 40 pF; or RL = 50 Ω, C L =  50  p F.   \nThe gain calibration is  specified for an open -circuited load, \nsuch as the high input resistance of an ADC. When resistively \nloaded, all gain values are nominally lowered as follows:  \n()LL UNLOADED\nLOADEDRR GG\n+=\nΩ150 (13) \nData Sheet  AD8330  \n \nRev. H | Page 21 of 32 Thus, when R L = 150 Ω, the gain is reduced by 6 dB; for R L = 75 Ω, \nthe reduction is 9.5 dB; and for R L = 50 Ω, it is 12 dB.  \nGain Errors Due to On -Chip Resistor Tolerances  \nIn all cases where external resistors are used, keep in mind that \nall on -chip resistances, including the R O and the input resistance \n(RI), are subject t o variances of up to ±20%.  \nThese variances need to be accounted for when calculating the \ngain with  input and output loading. This sensitivity  can be avoided  \nby adjusting the source and load resistances to bear an inverse \nrelationship as follows:  \nIf RS = αR I, then make R L = RO/α; or,  \nif RL = αR O, then make R S = RI/α \nThe simplest case is when R S = 1 kΩ and R L = 150 Ω, therefore, \nthe gain is 12 dB lower than the basic value. The reduction of \npeak swing at the load can be corrected by using V MAG =  1  V,  \nthere by restoring 6 dB of gain; using V MAG = 2 V restores the full \nbasic gain and doubles the peak available output swing.  \nOutput (Input) Common -Mode Control  \nThe output voltages are nominally positioned at the midpoint of \nthe supply, V S/2, over the range 2.7 V < V S < 6 V , and this voltage \nappears at Pin CNTR, which is not normally expected to be loaded  \n(the source resistance is ~4 kΩ). However, some circumstances \nrequire  a small change in this voltage, and a resistor from CNTR  to \nground can lower this voltage, w hereas a resistor to the supply \nraises it. On the other hand, this pin can be driven by an external  \nvoltage source to set the common -mode level to satisfy, for \nexample, the needs of a following ADC. Any value from 0.5 V above ground to 0.5 V below the supp ly is permissible.  Of course, \nwhen using an extreme common -mode level, the available \noutput swing is limited, and it is recommended that a value equal or close to the default of V\nCNTR = V S/2 be used. There may be a \nfew millivolts of offset between the applied voltage and the actual common -mode level at the output pins.  \nThe input common -mode voltage, V\nCMI, at Pin INHI and \nPin INLO is slaved to the output . It bears a y = mx + b linear \nand offset relationship to V CNTR as shown in Equation 14 where \ny = V CMI, m = 0.757, x = V CNTR, and b = 1.12 V for V DBS = 0.75 V \nand T = 25°C . \nVCMI = 0.757 V CNTR + 1.12 V  (14) \nThe effects of V DBS and ambient temperature on V CMI are shown \nin Figure 55. Thus, the default value for V CMI for V DBS = 0.75V,   \nT = 25°C  and VS = 5 V is 3.01 V. \nUSING THE AD8330  \nThis sect ion describes a few general aspects of using the AD8330. \nApplying the AD8330  to a wide variety of circum stances requires  \nvery few precautions.  \nAs in all high frequency circuits, careful observation of the ground \nnodes associated with each function is important. Three positive  \nsupply pins are provided: VPSI supports the input circuitry that \noften operates at a relatively high sensitivity; VPOS supports \ngene ral bias sources and needs no decoupling; and VPSO biases the output stage where decoupling can be useful in maintaining a glitch -free output. Figure 57 shows the general case, where VPSI  \nand VPSO are each provided with their own decoupling network,  \nbut this is not needed in all cases.  \nCOMMOPHI\nINLO OPLOINHIVPSI VPSO\nCMOPMODE\nVDBS CMG N VMAGOFST RTNC LBNE VPOS\nBIAS AND\nV-REF\nGAIN INTERFACECM MODE AND\nOFFSET CONTROL\nOUTPUT\nSTAGES\nOUTPUT\nCONTROLVGA COREOUTPUT,\n±2V MA X\nNCBASIC GAIN BIAS\nVDBS: 0V TO 1.5VCD2 FPHC 1DR\nCD1 CD3RD2\nGROUNDVS 2.7V TO 6V\nINPUT,\n0V TO ±2V MAX\nNC\n03217-058 \nFigure 57. Power Supply Decoupling and Basic Connections  \nBecause of the differential natur e of the signal path, power \nsupply decoupling is, in general, much less critical than in a single -sided amplifier; and where the minimization of board -\nlevel components is especially crucial, it is possible that these pins need no decoupling at all. On the other hand, when the signal source is single -sided, giving extra attention to the \ndecoupling on Pin VPSI is sometimes required. Likewise, care is required in decoupling the VPSO pin if the output is loaded on \nonly one of its two output pins. The general co mmon (COMM) \nand the output stage common (CMOP) are usually grounded as \nshown in the Figure 57; however, the Applications Information  \nsection shows how a negative supply can optionally be used.  \nThe AD8330 is enabled by taking the ENBL pin to a logical high \n(or, in all cases, the supply). The UP gain mode is enabled either by leaving the MODE pin unconnected or taking it to a logical \nhigh. When the opposite gain direction is needed, ground the \nMODE pin or drive  it to a logical low. The CHPF capacitor \ndetermines the low -pass corner of the offset loop; this is \npreferably tied to the CNTR pin that  in turn, must  be decoupled \nto ground. The gain interface common pin (CMGN) is \ngrounded, and the output magnitude control pin (VMAG) is \nleft unconnected, or can optionally be co nnected to a 500 mV \nsource for basic gain calibration.  \nConnections to the input and output pins are not shown in Figure 57 \nbecause of the many options  that are available. When  the AD8330  is \nused to drive an ADC, connect the OPHI and OPLO pins directly to the differential inputs of a suitable converter, such as an AD9214 . \nAD8330  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. H | Page 22 of 32 If an adjustment is needed to this common -mode level,  it can be \nintroduced by applying that voltage to the CNTR pin, or, more \nsimply, by using a resistor from this pin to either ground or th e \nsupply (see the Applications Information  section). The CNTR pin \ncan also supply the common -mode voltage to an ADC that \nsupports such a feature. \nWhen the loads to be  driven introduce a dc resistive path to \nground, coupling capacitors must be used. These must  be of \nsufficient value to pass the lowest frequency components of the \nsignal without excessive attenuation. Keep in mind that the voltage swing on such loads alte rnates  both above and below ground, \nrequiring that the subsequent component must be able to cope with negative signal excursions.  \nGain and Swing Adjustments When Loaded  \nThe output can also be coupled to a load via a transformer to achieve a higher load pow er by impedance transformation. For \nexample, using a 2:1 turns ratio, a 50 Ω final load presents a 200  Ω \nload on the output. The gain loss (relative to the basic value with no \ntermination) is 20 log10{(200+150)/200} or 4.86 dB, which can \nbe restored by rai sing the voltage on the VMAG pin by a factor \nof 10\n4.86/20 or × 1.75, from its basic value of 0.5 V to 0.875 V . This \nalso restores the peak swing at the 200  Ω level to ±2 V , or ±1 V \ninto the 50 Ω final load.  \nWhenever a stable supply voltage is available, additional voltage swing can be provided by adding a resistor from the VMAG pin to the supply. The calculation is based on knowing that the internal \nbias is delivered via a 5  kΩ source; because an additional 0 .375 V  is \nneeded, the current in this external resistor must be 0.375 V/  \n5 kΩ = 75 μA. Thus, using a 5 V supply, a resistor of 5  V − 0.875 V/  \n75 μA = 55 kΩ is used. Based on this example, the corrections \nfor other load conditions are easy to calculate. If the effects on \ngain and peak output swing due to supply variations cannot be tolerated, VMAG must be driven by an accurate voltage.  \nInput Coupling  \nThe dc common -mode voltage at the input pins varies with the \nsupply, the basic gain bias, and temperature (se e Figure 55); for \nthis reason, many applicati ons need to use coupling capaci tors \nfrom the source that are large enough to support the lowest frequencies to be transmit ted. Using one capacitor at each input \npin, their minimum values can be readily  found  from the expression  \nC\nIN_CPL = (320 µF/fHPF) (15) \nwhere fHPF is the – 3dB frequency expressed in hertz. Thus, for \nan f HPF of 10 kHz, 33 nF capacitors are used.  \nOccasionall y, it is possible to avoid the use of coupling capacitors \nwhen the dc level of the driving source is within a certain range, as shown in Figure 56. This range extends from 3.5 V to 4.5 V when \nusing a 5 V supply, and at high basic gains, where the effect  of an \nincorrect dc level degrades the noise level due to internal aspects of the inp ut stage. For example, suppose the driver, IC, is an LNA \nhaving  an output topology in which its load resistors are taken \nto the supply, and the output is buffered by emitter followers. This presents a source for the AD8330  that can be directly  coupled.  DC-Coupled Signal Path  \nIn many cases, where the VGA is not required to provide its lowest noise, the full common -mode input range of zero to V\nS \ncan be used without problems, avoiding the need for any ac \ncoupling means. However, such direct coupling at both the input \nand output does not automatically result in a fully dc -coupled \nsignal path. The internal offset compensation loop must also be \ndisen gaged by connecting the OFST pin to ground. Note that at  \nthe maximum basic gain of 50 dB (×316), every millivolt of offset  at \nthe input, arising from whatever source, causes an output offset of 316 mV , which is an appreciable fraction of the peak output sw ing. \nBecause  the offset correction loop is placed after the front -end \nvariable gain sections of the AD8330, the most effective way of dealing with such offsets is at the input pins, as shown in Figure 58. \nFor example, assume, for illustrative purposes, that the resistances \nassociated with each side of the source in a certain application \nare 50  Ω. If  this source has a very low (op amp) output impedance,  \ninsert the extra resistors, with a negligible noise penalty and an \nattenuation of only 0.83  dB. The resistor values shown provide a \ntrim range of about ±2 mV .  \nUsing Single -Sided Sources and Loads  \nWhere the source provides a single- sided output, either INHI or \nINLO can be used for the input, with a polarity change when using \nINLO. The unused pin must be connected either through a capacitor to ground,  or through a dc bias point  that corresponds closely to \nthe dc level on the active signal pin. The input CMRR over the full frequency range is illustrated in Figure 59. In some cases, an \nadditional element such as a  SAW filter (having a single -sided \nbalanced configuration) or a flux- coupled transformer can be \ninterposed. Where this element must be terminated  in the correct \nimpedance, other than 1 kΩ, it is necessary to add either shunt or series resistors at this int erface.  \nCOMMOPHI\nINLO OPLOINHIVPSI VPSO\nCMOPMODE\nVDB S CMG N VMAGOFST RTNC LBNE VPOS\nBIAS AND\nV-REF\nGAIN INTERFACECM MODE AND\nOFFSET CONTROL\nOUTPUT\nSTAGES\nOUTPUT\nCONTROLVGA COREOUTPUT,\n±2VMAX\nNCBASIC GAIN BIAS\nVDBS: 0V TO 1.5V1DR\nCD1 CD3RD2\n50kΩ\n75kΩRS ASSUMED\nTO BE 50 Ω\nON EACH\nSIDE\nGROUND\n03217-059CD2VS 2.7V TO 6V\n \nFigure 58.

AC Gain and Phase for Various Loading Conditions  \nWhen driving a single -sided load, either OPHI or OPLO can be \nused. These outputs are very symmetric, so the only effect of \nthis choice is to select the desired polarity. However, when the \nfrequency range of interest extends to the upper limits of the AD8330, a ttach a  dummy resistor of the same value to the \nunused output. Figure 60 illustrates the ac gain and phase \nresponse for various loads and V\nDBS = 0.75 V . Line 1 shows the \nunloaded (C L = 12 pF) case for reference; the gain is 6 dB lower \n(20 dB) using only the single -sided output. Adding a 75 Ω load \nfrom OPH I to an ac ground results in Line 2. The gain becomes \na factor of ×1.5 V or 3.54 dB lower, but artifacts of the output \ncommon -mode control loop appear in both the magnitude and \nphase response.  \nAdding a dummy 75 Ω to OPLO results in Line 3: the gain is a \nfurther 2.5 dB lower, at about 14 dB. The CM artifacts are no longer  \npresent but a small amount of peaking occurs. If objectionable, this \ncan be eliminated by raising both of the capacitors on the output pins to 25 pF, as shown in Line 4 of Figure 60. \nThe gain reduction incurred both by using only one output and by the additional effect of loading can be overcome by taking advantage of the VMAG feature, provided primaril y for just such  \ncircumstances. Thus, to restore the basic gain in the first case (Line 1), apply a 1 V source  to this pin; to restore the gain in the \nsecond case, this voltage must  be raised by a factor of ×1.5 to 1.5 V .  In C ase 3 and Case 4, a further factor of ×1.33 is needed to make  \nup the 2.5 dB loss, that is, raise V\nMAG to 2 V . With the restoration \nof gain, the peak output swing at the load is, likewise restored to ± 2  V.  \nPulse Operation  \nWhen using the AD8330 in applications where its transient \nresponse is of greater interest and the outputs are conveyed to their loads via coaxial cables, the added capacitances can slightly  \ndiffer in value, and can be placed either at the sending or load end of the cables, or divided between these nodes. Figure 61 \nshows an illustrative example where dual, 1 meter, 75  Ω cables \nare driven through dc -blocking capacitors and are independently  \nterminated at ground level.  \nBecause of the considerable variation between applications,  only \ngeneral recommendations can be made with regard to minimizing  \npulse overshoot and droop. The former can be optimized by \nadding small load capaci tances, if necessary; the latter requires \nthe use of sufficiently large capacitors (C1).  \nFigure 62 shows typical results for V\nDBS = 0.24 V , a square wave \ninput amplitude of 450 mV (the actual combination is not important), a rise time of 2 ns, and V\nMAG raised to 2.0 V . In the \nupper waveforms, the load capacitors are both zero, and a small \namount of overshoot is visible; with 40  p F,  the response is cleaner. \nA shunt capacitance of 20 pF from OPHI to OPLO has a similar effect. Coupling capacitors for this demonstration are sufficiently  \nlarge to p revent any visible droop over this time scale. The outputs \nat the load side eventually assum e a mean value of zero, with \nnegative and positive excursions depending on the duty cycle.  \nCOMMOPHI\nINLO OPLOINHIVPSI VPSO\nCMOPMODE\nVDB S CMG N VMAGOFST RTNC LBNE VPOS\nBIAS AND\nV-REF\nGAIN INTERFACECM MODE AND\nOFFSET CONTROL\nOUTPUT\nSTAGES\nOUTPUT\nCONTROLVGA CORE\nNCCD2\nCD3RD2VS 2.7V–6V\nC1\nC1CL1\nCL2RL1\nRL2\n03217-062 \nFigure 61.

Typical Pulse Response for Figure 61 \nThe bandwidth from Pin VMAG to these outputs is somewhat \nhigher than from the normal input pins. Thus, when this pin is used to rapidly modulate the primary signal, some further experimentation with response optimization may be required. \nIn general, the AD8330 is very tolerant of a wide range of \nloading conditions.  \nPreserving Absolute Gain  \nAlthough the AD8330 is not laser trimmed, its absolute gain \ncalibration, based mainly on ratios, is very good. Full details are found in the Specifications  section  and in the typical performance  \ncurves (see the Typical Performance Characteristics  section). \nNevertheless, having finite input and output impedances, the gain is necessarily dependent on the source and load conditions. The loss that is incurred when either of these is finit e causes an \nerror in the absolute gain. The absolute gain can also be \nuncertain due to the approximately ±20% tolerance in the \nabsolute value of the input and output impedances.  \nOften, such losses and uncertainties can be tolerated and accommodated by a co rrection to the gain control bias. On the \nother hand, the error in the loss can be essentially nulled by using appropriate modifications to either the source impedance \n(R\nS) or the load impedance (R L), or both (in some cases by \npadding them with series or s hunt components).  \nThe formulation for this correction technique was previously \ndescribed. However, to simplify its use, Table 5 shows spot \nvalues for combinations of R S and R L resulting in an overall loss \nthat is not dependent on sample -to-sample variations in on chip \nresistances. Furthermore, this fixed and predictable loss can be \ncorrected by an adjustment to V MAG, as indicated in Table 5. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Table 5.

A more thorough treatment of \nnoise mechanisms, for the case where the source is reactive, is \nbeyond the scope of these brief notes. Also note that V NOISE_IN  is \nthe voltage noise spectral density appearing across INHI and \nINLO, the differential input pins.  In preparing for the  calculation \nof the noise figure, V SIG is defined as the open -circuit signal \nvoltage across the source, and V IN is defined as the differential \ninput to the AD8330. The relatio nship is simply  \n()S II SIG\nINR RRVV+=  (17) \nAt maximum gain, E NSD is 4.1 nV/√Hz, and I NSD is 3 pA/√Hz. \nThus, the short -circuit voltage noise is  \n()()() { }=+Ω + =22 2\n_ 0 1 / 3 / 1.4 k Hz pA HzVnIN NOISEV \n5.08 nV/√Hz  (18) \nNext, examine the net noise when R S = R I = 1 kΩ, often incor -\nrectly cal led the matching condition, rather than source impedance \ntermination, which is the actual situation in this case.  \nRepeating the procedure, \n( )()()22 2\n_ kΩ1 kΩ1 Hz/pA3 Hz/nV1.4 + + =IN NOISEV\n= 7.3 nV/√Hz  (19) \nData Sheet  AD8330 \nRev.

However, the noise figure rises to 17.2 db if it  \nis recalculated using the procedures in Equation  16 thro ugh \nEquation 24.  \nDistortion Considerations  \nContinuously variable gain amplifiers invariably employ \nnonlinear circuit elements; consequently, it is common for their \ndistortion to be higher than well -designed fixed gain amplifiers. \nThe translinear multiplier  principles used in the AD8330, in \ntheory, yield extremely low distortion, a result of the funda -\nmental linearization technique that is an inherent aspect of these circuits.  I\nn practice, however, the effect of device mismatches and junc -\ntion resistances in the core cell, and other mechanisms in its \nsupporting circuitry inevitably cause distortion, further aggravated \nby other effects in the later output stages. Some of these effects are very consistent from one sample to the next, while those due to mismatches (causing predominantly even -order distortion \ncomponents) are quite variable. Where the highest linearity (and lowest noise) is demanded, consider using one of the X -\nAMP products such as the AD603 (single- channel), AD604 \n(dual -channel), or AD8332 (wideband dual -channel with \nultralow noise LNAs).  \nP1dB and V1dB  \nIn addition to the nonlinearities that arise within the core of the AD8330, at moderate output levels, another metric that is more commonly stated for RF components that deliver appreciable power to a load is the 1 dB compression point. This is defined in a very specific  manner: it is that point at which, with increasing  \noutput level, the power delivered to the load eventually falls to a \nvalue that is 1 dB lower than it would be for a perfectly linear \nsystem. (Although this metric is sometimes called the 1 dB gain compression point, it is important to note that this is not the output level at which the incremental gain has fallen by 1 dB).  \nAs shown in Figure 49, the output of the AD8330 limits quite \nabruptly, and the gain drops sharply above the clipping level. The output power, on the other hand, using an external resistive \nload, R\nL, continues to increase. In the most extreme case, the \nwaveform changes from the sinusoidal form of the test signal, with an amplitude just below the clipping level, V\nCLIP, to a \nsquare  wave  of precisely the same amplitude. The change in \npower over this range is from (V CLIP/√2)2/RL to (V CLIP)2/RL, that \nis, a factor of 2, or 3 dB in power terms. It can be shown that for an ideal limiting amplifier, the 1 dB compression point occurs for an  overdrive factor of 2 dB.  \nFor example, if the AD8330 is driving a 150 Ω load and V\nMAG is \nset to 2 V , the peak output is nominally ±4 V (as noted  previously, \nthe actual value , when loaded. can dif fer be cause of a mismatch \nbetween on -chip and external resistors), or 2.83  V rms for a sine \nwave output that corresponds to a power of 53.3 mW , that is, \n17.3 dBm in 150 Ω. Thus, the P1dB level, at 2 dB above \nclipping, is 19.3 dBm.  \nThough not involving powe r transfer, it is sometimes useful  \nto state the V1dB, which is the output voltage (unloaded or loaded) that is 2 dB above clipping for a sine waveform. In the above example, this voltage is still 2.83 V rms, which can be expressed as 9.04 dBV (0 dBV corre sponds to a 1 V sine wave). \nThus, the V1dB is at 11.04 dBV .  \nAD8330 Data Sheet  \nRev. H | Page 26 of 32 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe versatility  of the AD8330, its very constant ac response over \na wide range of gains, the large signal dynamic range, output \nswing, single supply operation, and low power consumption commend this VGA to a diverse variety of app lications. Only a \nfew can be de scribe d here, including the mo st basic uses and some \nunusual ones.  \nADC DRIVING  \nThe AD8330 i s well- suited t o drive a h igh s peed c onverter. \nThere are many h igh sp eed c onverters available,  but to illustrate \nthe general features, the example  in this data sheet uses one of \nthe le ast expensive, the AD9214. This is available in three \ngrades for operation at 65 MHz, 80 MHz, and 105 MHz; the \nAD9214BRSZ-80  is a good complement to the general \ncapabilities of this VGA. \nFigure 63 shows the connections to drive an ADC. A 3.3 V \nsupply i s used f or both parts. T he A D C r equires th at its i nput \npins be positioned at one third of the supply, or 1.1 V. Given \nthat the default output l evel o f the VGA is o ne-h alf the supply  \nor 1.65 V, a small correction is introduced by the 8 kΩ resistor \nfrom C NTR to g round. T he A DC sp ecifications require th at the \ncommon -mode in put b e wit hin ±0.2 V o f the  nominal 1 .1 V; \nvariations o f up to ± 20% i n  the AD8330 on -chip resistors c hange \nthis voltage by only ±70 mV. With the connections shown in \nFigure \n63, the AD9214 is able to receive an input of 2 V p-p ; \nthe\n peak output of the AD8330 can be reduced if desired by \nadding\n a resistor  from\n VMAG to ground. An overrange condition is sig naled by a \nhigh state on Pin OR of the AD9214. DFS/GAIN is  unconnected \nin this example producing an offset- binary output. To provide a \ntwos complement output, connect  it to the REF  pin. \nFor ADCs running at sampling rates substantially below the \nbandwidth of the AD8330, an intervening noise filter is \nrecommended to limit the noise bandwidth. A one -pole filter \ncan easily be created  with a single differential capacitor between \nthe OPHI and OPLO outputs. For a corner frequency of f C, the \ncapacitor must  have a value of  \nCFILT = 1/942 f C (26) \nFor example, a 10 MHz corner requires about 100 pF.  \nSIMPLE AGC AMPLIFIER  \nFigure 64 illustrates the use of the inverted gain mode and the \noffset gain range (0.2 V < V DBS < 1.7 V) in supporting a low cost \nAGC loop. Q1 is used as a detector. When OPHI is sufficient ly \nhigher than CNTR, due to the signal swing, it conducts and charges C1. This raises V\nDBS and rapidly lowers the gain. Note \nthat MODE is grounded (see Figure 48). The minimum voltage \nneeded across R1 to set up the full gain is 0.2 V because CMGN is dc open -circuited (this does not alter V\nMAG) and the maximum \nvoltage is 1.7 V .  \nCOMMOPHI\nINLO OPLOINHIVPSI VPSO\nCMOPMODE\nVDBS CMGNOFST CNTR ENBL VPOS\nBIAS AND\nV-REFCM MODE AND\nOFFSET CONTROL\nOUTPUT\nSTAGES\nOUTPUT\nCONTROLVGA CORE AD9214BRS-80\nDATA OUTPUTS\nD0D1D2D3D4D5D6D7D8D9\nDGND\nCLKAGND\nCLOCKREF\n0.1µFREFSENSE\nNC\nANALOG GROUNDAINAINDFS/GAINPWRDN\nDIGITAL\nGROUNDGAIN BIAS,\nVDBS,0V–1.5VNCINPUT,\n±2V MAX0.1µF10Ω\nGAIN INTERFACECHPF8kΩ0.1µF 0.1µF\nAVDDOR\nDrV DD3.3Ω\nOVER-\nRANGE3.3Ω\n0.1µFVS,3.3V\n03217-064VMAG\nFigu\nre 63.

This change in the Q1 \ncurrent causes an increase of ~0.25 dB over the full gain range \nin the differential output of nominally 0.75 dBV at midrange (3.08 V p -p), corresponding to a 200:1 compression ratio.

The waveforms in Figure 65 show the AGC voltage (V\nDBS). This simple detector exhibits a temperature variation in the \ndifferential output amplitude of about 4 mV/°C. It provides a \nfast attack time (an increase in the input is quick ly leveled to the \nnominal output, due to the high peak currents in Q1) and a slow release time (a decrease in the input is not restored as quickly). The voltage at the VDBS pin can be used as an RSSI output, scaled 30 mV/dB. Note that the attack time can b e \nhalved by adding a second transistor, labeled Q2 in Figure 64. \nFor operation at lower frequencies, the AGC hold capacitor must be increased.  \nWIDE RANGE TRUE RMS VOLTMETER  \nThe AD8362  is an rms responding detector providing a dynamic  \nrange of 60 dB from low frequencies to 2.7 GHz. This can increase  \nto 110 dB using an AD8330 as a preconditioner, provided the \nnoise bandwidth is limited by an interstage low -pass or band -\npass filter.  \nThe VGA also provides an input port that is easier to drive than \nthe 200 Ω input of the AD8362. Figure 67 shows the general \nscheme.  \nBoth the AD8330 and AD8362 provide linear -in-decibel control \ninterfaces. Thus, when the output of the AD8362 is used to  control \nthe gain of t he AD8330, the functional form is unaffected. The \noverall scaling is 33 mV/dB. Figure 68 shows the time do main \nresponse using a loop filter capacitor of 10 nF, for inputs ranging  \nfrom 10 μV to 1 V rms, that is, a 100 dB measurement  range.  \nTIME ( µs)0GAIN ER ROR (dB)\n–11\n–33\n102030405060708090100110120130140150–20\n–420.751.25\n0.251.75\n0.501.00\n01.50VDBS\nOUTPUT\n03217-067 \nFigure 66.

It includes test pins for connections to all of the functional \ndevice inputs. Figure 69 is a full size photograph of the board.  \n03217-070\n \nFigure 69. Photograph of the AD8330 Evaluation Board  BASIC OPE RATION  \nThe input SMA connector IN is terminated with a 49.9 Ω resistor (see Figure 70). For convenience, the board includes an \nAD8131 high speed differential amplifier to convert a single -\nended signal source to the differential input of the AD8330. If desired, the AD8131 can be removed and the AD8330 can be \ndriven at one of its inputs from a single -ended source.  \nThe AD8330 output is observed at the SMA connectors OUT_HI \nand OUT_LO or by  using the 2 -pin header OUT_HI/OUT_LO \nadjacent to the device.  \nThe AD8330 requires only a +5 V power supply; however, because \nof the AD8131 buffer bipolar power supply requirements, ±5 V \nsupplies are required to power the board. The current required for the board is approximately 40 mA from the +5 V supply and 10 mA from the −5 V supply.  \n03217-071872\n3\n9GAIN_SLOPEC5\n0.1µFC3\n0.1µF\nINLOMODEVPSIINHIVPSO\nCMOPOPLOCNTROFST\nOPHI8ENBLVPOS\n+5V1\n6541516\n14\n13\nCOMMVMAG VDBS\nCMGN12\n11\n10C2\n0.1µF\nUPC18\n0.1µF\n+5V\nC6\n0.1µFIN+5V\nC7\n0.1µF\nCMGNVDBS VMAGC10\n0.1µFC19\n0.1µF\nC110.1µFC4\n0.1µF+5V\nC14\n10nFC15\n0.1µFCNTRENBL\n34\n5\n612\nC16\n10nF\nC200.1µFC1710µF10V–5VGND1 GND2 GND3 GND4\nFLTR\nC912pF\nC8\n12pFC12\n0.1µFR4\n0Ω\nR2\n49.9Ω\nR1\n24.9ΩOUT_HI\nOUT_ LOR3\n1kΩ\nOUT_TESTIN_TESTC1\n10µF\n10V+OFSTC13\n1nF\nDOWN\n+A1DUT1\nAD8330FILTER_OFFSET\nAD8131\n \nFigure 70.
