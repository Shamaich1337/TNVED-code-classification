They have generous\nrouting resources to accommodate the most complex inter-connect patterns. \nThe devices are customized by loading configuration data\ninto internal static memory cells. Re-programming is possi-\nble an unlimited number of times. The values stored in thesememory cells determine the logic functions and intercon-\nnections implemented in the FPGA. The FPGA can eitheractively read its configuration data from an external serialPROM (Master Serial mode), or the configuration data canbe written into the FPGA from an external device (SlaveSerial mode).\nSpartan series FPGAs can be used where hardware must\nbe adapted to different user applications. FPGAs are idealfor shortening design and development cycles, and alsooffer a cost-effective solution for production rates wellbeyond 50,000 systems per month. \nFigure 1:  Basic FPGA Block DiagramCLBB-\nSCAN\nCLB CLB CLB\nCLB CLB\nRouting Channels\nVersaRing Routing ChannelsCLB CLB\nCLB CLB CLB CLB\nCLB CLB CLB CLBIOB\nIOBIOB\nIOBIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOBIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOB\nIOBRDBKSTART\n-UPOSC\nDS060_01_081100\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 3\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nSpartan and Spartan-XL devices provide system clock\nrates exceeding 80 MHz and internal performance inexcess of 150 MHz. In addition to the conventional benefitof high volume programmable logic solutions, Spartanseries FPGAs also offer on-chip edge-triggered single-portand dual-port RAM, clock enables on all flip-flops, fast carrylogic, and many other features.\nThe Spartan/XL families leverage the highly successful\nXC4000 architecture with many of that family’s features andbenefits. Technology advancements have been derivedfrom the XC4000XLA process developments.\nLogic Functional Description \nThe Spartan series uses a standard FPGA structure asshown in Figure 1, page 2 . The FPGA consists of an array\nof configurable logic blocks (CLBs) placed in a matrix ofrouting channels. The input and output of signals isachieved through a set of input/output blocks (IOBs) forminga ring around the CLBs and routing channels.\n\x81 CLBs provide the functional elements for implementing \nthe user’s logic. \n\x81 IOBs provide the interface between the package pins \nand internal signal lines. \n\x81 Routing channels provide paths to interconnect the \ninputs and outputs of the CLBs and IOBs.\nThe functionality of each circuit block is customized during\nconfiguration by programming in ternal static memory cells.\nThe values stored in these memory cells determine thelogic functions and interconnections implemented in theFPGA.Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs)\nThe CLBs are used to implement most of the logic in anFPGA. The principal CLB elements are shown in the simpli-fied block diagram in Figure 2 . There are three look-up\ntables (LUT) which are used as logic function generators,two flip-flops and two groups of signal steering multiplexers.There are also some more advanced features provided bythe CLB which will be covered in the Advanced Features\nDescription , page 13 .\nFunction Generators\nTwo 16 x 1 memory look-up tables (F-LUT and G-LUT) are\nused to implement 4-input function generators, each offer-ing unrestricted logic implementation of any Boolean func-tion of up to four independent input signals (F1 to F4 or G1to G4). Using memory look-up tables the propagation delayis independent of the function implemented.\nA third 3-input function generator (H-LUT) can implement\nany Boolean function of its three inputs. Two of these inputsare controlled by programmable multiplexers (see box "A" ofFigure 2 ). These inputs can come from the F-LUT or G-LUT\noutputs or from CLB inputs. The third input always comesfrom a CLB input. The CLB can, therefore, implement cer-tain functions of up to nine inputs, like parity checking. Thethree LUTs in the CLB can also be combined to do any arbi-trarily defined Boolean function of five inputs.\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\n4 www.xilinx.com DS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nA CLB can implement any of the following functions:\n\x81 Any function of up to four variables, plus any second \nfunction of up to four unrelated variables, plus any third function of up to three unrelated variables\nNote:  When three separate functions are generated, one of \nthe function outputs must be capt ured in a flip-flop internal to \nthe CLB. Only two unregistered function generator outputs \nare available from the CLB.\n\x81 Any single function of five variables \n\x81 Any function of four variables together with some \nfunctions of six variables \n\x81 Some functions of up to nine variables.\nImplementing wide functions in a single block reduces both\nthe number of blocks required and the delay in the signalpath, achieving both increased capacity and speed. \nThe versatility of th e CLB function generators significantly\nimproves system speed. In addition, the design-softwaretools can deal with each function generator independently.This flexibility improves cell usage. Flip-Flops \nEach CLB contains two flip-flops that can be used to regis-ter (store) the function generator outputs. The flip-flops andfunction generators can also be used independently (seeFigure 2 ). The CLB input DIN can be used as a direct input\nto either of the two flip-flops. H1 can also drive eitherflip-flop via the H-LUT with a slight additional delay.\nThe two flip-flops have common clock (CK), clock enable\n(EC) and set/reset (SR) inputs. Internally both flip-flops are\nalso controlled by a global initialization signal (GSR) whichis described in detail in Global Signals: GSR and GTS ,\npage 20 . \nLatches (Spartan-XL Family Only)\nThe Spartan-XL family CLB storage elements can also be\nconfigured as latches. The two latches have common clock(K) and clock enable (EC) inputs. Functionality of the stor-age element is described in Table 2 .Figure 2:  Spartan/XL Simplified CLB Logic Diagram (some features not shown)G4\nG\nH1\nFG4\nG3 G3\nG2 G2\nG1DY Q\nY\nXSR\nCK\nECQ\nG1\nSR\nH1\nDING\nHLogic\nFunction\nof\nG1-G4\nLogic\nFunction\nof\nF-G-H1\nMultiplexer Controlled\nby Configuration ProgramG-LUT\nF4 F4\nF3 F3\nF2 F2\nF1 F1\nK\nECGLogic\nFunction\nof\nF1-F4\nF-LUTH-LUT\nAB\nDX QSR\nCK\nECQ\nDS060_02_0506 01\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 5\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\n.Clock Input \nEach flip-flop can be triggered on either the rising or falling\nclock edge. The CLB clock line is shared by both flip-flops.However, the clock is individually invertible for each flip-flop(see CK path in Figure 3 ). Any inverter placed on the clock\nline in the design is automati cally absorbed into the CLB. \nClock Enable \nThe clock enable line (EC) is active High. The EC line is\nshared by both flip-flops in a CLB. If either one is left discon-nected, the clock enable for that flip-flop defaults to theactive state. EC is not invertible within the CLB. The clockenable is synchronous to the clock and must satisfy thesetup and hold timing specified for the device.\nSet/Reset\nThe set/reset line (SR) is an asynchronous active High con-\ntrol of the flip-flop. SR can be configured as either set orreset at each flip-flop. This configuration option determinesthe state in which each flip-flop becomes operational afterconfiguration. It also determines the effect of a GSR pulseduring normal operation, and the effect of a pulse on the SRline of the CLB. The SR line is shared by both flip-flops. If\nSR is not specified for a flip-flo p the set/reset for that flip-flop\ndefaults to the inactive state. SR is not invertible within theCLB.\nCLB Signal Flow Control\nIn addition to the H- LUT input control mult iplexers (shown in\nbox "A" of Figure 2, page 4 ) there are signal flow control\nmultiplexers (shown in box "B" of Figure 2 ) which select the\nsignals which drive the flip-flop inputs and the combinatorialCLB outputs (X and Y).\nEach flip-flop input is driven  from a 4:1 multiplexer which\nselects among the three LUT outputs and DIN as the datasource.\nEach combinatorial output is driven from a 2:1 multiplexer\nwhich selects between two of the LUT outputs. The X outputcan be driven from the F-LUT or H-LUT, the Y output fromG-LUT or H-LUT.\nControl Signals \nThere are four signal control multiplexers on the input of the\nCLB. These multiplexers allow the internal CLB control sig-\nnals (H1, DIN, SR, and EC in Figure 2  and Figure 4 ) to be\ndriven from any of the four general control inputs (C1-C4 inFigure 4 ) into the CLB. Any of these inputs can drive any of\nthe four internal control signals.

Each IOB controls one package pin and can be con-figured for input, output, or bidirectional signals. Figure 6\nshows a simplified functional block diagram of the Spar-\ntan/XL FPGA IOB. IOB Input Signal Path\nThe input signal to the IOB can be configured to either godirectly to the routing channels (via I1 and I2 in Figure 6 ) or\nto the input register. The input register can be programmedas either an edge-triggered flip-flop or a level-sensitivelatch.

For example, IFD is the basic input flip-flop(rising edge triggered), and ILD is the basic input latch(transparent-High). Variations with inverted clocks are alsoavailable. The clock signal inverter is also shown in Figure 5\non the CK line.\nThe Spartan family IOB data input path has a one-tap delay\nelement: either the delay is inserted (default), or it is not.The Spartan-XL family IOB data input path has a two-tapdelay element, with choices of a full delay, a partial delay, orno delay. The added delay guarantees a zero hold time withrespect to clocks routed through the global clock buffers.(See Global Nets and Buffers , page 12  for a description of\nthe global clock buffers in the Spartan/XL families.) For ashorter input register setup time, with positive hold-time,attach a NODELAY attribute or property to the flip-flop.Theoutput of the input register goes to the routing channels (viaI1 and I2 in Figure 6 ). The I1 and I2 signals that exit the IOB\ncan each carry either the direct or registered input signal.\nThe 5V Spartan family input buffers can be globally config-\nured for either TTL (1.2V) or CMOS (VCC/2) thresholds,using an option in the bitstream generation software. The\nSpartan family output levels are also configurable; the twoglobal adjustments of input threshold and output level areindependent. The inputs of Spartan devices can be drivenby the outputs of any 3.3V device, if the Spartan familyinputs are in TTL mode. Input and output thresholds areTTL on all configuration pins until the configuration hasbeen loaded into the device and specifies how they are tobe used. Spartan-XL family inputs are TTL compatible and3.3V CMOS compatible.\nSupported sources for Spartan/XL device inputs are shown\nin Table 4 .\nSpartan-XL family I/Os are fully 5V tolerant even though the\nV\nCC is 3.3V. This allows 5V signals to directly connect to the\nSpartan-XL family inputs without damage, as shown inTable 4 . In addition, the 3.3V V\nCC can be applied before or\nafter 5V signals are applied to the I/Os. This makes theSpartan-XL devices immune to power supply sequencingproblems.\nFigure 6:  Simplified Spartan/XL IOB Block DiagramMultiplexer Controlled\nby Configuration ProgramT\nO\nOKQGTS\nD\nCK\nEC\nI1\nI2\nIK\nECQ D\nCK\nECDelayPackage\nPad\nProgrammable\nPull-Up/\nPull-Down\nNetworkOUTPUT DRIVER\nProgrammable Slew Rate\nProgrammable TTL/CMOS Drive\n(Spartan only) \nINPUT BUFFER\nDS060_06_041901\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\n8 www.xilinx.com DS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\n Spartan-XL Family VCC Clamping\nSpartan-XL FPGAs have an optional clamping diode con-\nnected from each I/O to VCC. When enabled they clamp\nringing transients back to the 3.3V supply rail. This clampingaction is required in 3.3V PCI applications. V\nCC clamping is\na global option affecting all I/O pins.\nSpartan-XL devices are fully 5V TTL I/O compatible if VCC\nclamping is not enabled. With VCC clamping enabled, the\nSpartan-XL devices will begin to clamp input voltages to\none diode voltage drop above VCC. If enabled, TTL I/O com-\npatibility is maintained but full 5V I/O tolerance is sacrificed.\nThe user may select either 5V tolerance (default) or 3.3VPCI compatibility. In both case s negative voltage is clamped\nto one diode voltage drop below ground. \nSpartan-XL devices are compatible with TTL, LVTTL, PCI\n3V, PCI 5V and LVCMOS sig nalling. The va rious standards\nare illustrated in Table 5 .\nAdditional Fast Capture Input Latch (Spartan-XL Family \nOnly)\nThe Spartan-XL family OB has an additional optional latch\non the input. This latch is clocked by the clock used for theoutput flip-flop rather than the input clock. Therefore, twodifferent clocks can be used to clock the two input storageelements. This additional latch allows the fast capture ofinput data, which is then synchronized to the internal clockby the IOB flip-flop or latch.\nTo place the Fast Capture latch in a design, use one of the\nspecial library symbols, ILFFX or ILFLX. ILFFX is a trans-parent-Low Fast Capture latch followed by an active Highinput flip-flop. ILFLX is a trans parent Low Fast Capture latch\nfollowed by a transparent High input latch. Any of the clockinputs can be inverted before driving the library element,and the inverter is absorbed into the IOB.\nIOB Output Signal Path\nOutput signals can be optionally inverted within the IOB,and can pass directly to the output buffer or be stored in anedge-triggered flip-flop and then to the output buffer. Thefunctionality of this flip-flop is shown in Table 6 .Table  4:  Supported Sources for Spartan/XL Inputs\nSourceSpartan\nInputsSpartan-XL\nInputs\n5V,\nTTL5V, \nCMOS3.3V\nCMOS\nAny device, VCC = 3.3V, \nCMOS outputs√ Unreli- \nable \nData√\nSpartan family, VCC = 5V,\nTTL outputs√√\nAny device, VCC = 5V, \nTTL outputs (VOH ≤ 3.7V)√√\nAny device, VCC = 5V, \nCMOS outputs√√ √  (default \nmode)\nTable  5:  I/O Standards Supported by Spartan-XL FPGAs\nSignaling \nStandardVCC \nClampingOutput \nDrive VIH MAX VIH MIN VIL MAX VOH MIN VOL MAX\nTTL Not allowed 12/24 mA 5.5 2.0 0.8 2.4 0.4\nLVTTL OK 12/24 mA 3.6 2.0 0.8 2.4 0.4PCI5V Not allowed 24 mA 5.5 2.0 0.8 2.4 0.4PCI3V Required 12 mA 3.6 50% of V\nCC 30% of VCC 90% of VCC 10% of VCC\nLVCMOS 3V OK 12/24 mA 3.6 50% of VCC 30% of VCC 90% of VCC 10% of VCC\nTable  6:  Output Flip-Flop Functionality\n   Mode ClockClock \nEnable T D Q\nPower-Up \nor GSRXX 0 * X S R\nFlip-Flop X 0 0* X Q\n1* 0* D D\nXX1XZ\n0X 0 * XQ\nLegend:\nX Don’t care\nRising edge (clock not inverted). \nSR Set or Reset value.

The multiplexer can also be configured as a 2-inputfunction generator, implementing a pass gate, AND gate,OR gate, or XOR gate, with 0, 1, or 2 inverted inputs.\nWhen configured as a multiplexer, this feature allows two\noutput signals to time-share the same output pad, effec-tively doubling the number of device outputs without requir-ing a larger, more expensive package. The select input isthe pin used for the output flip-flop clock, OK.\nWhen the multiplexer is configured as a 2-input function\ngenerator, logic can be implemented within the IOB itself.Combined with a Global buff er, this arrangement allows\nvery high-speed gating of a single signal. For example, awide decoder can be implemented in CLBs, and its outputgated with a Read or Write Strobe driven by a global buffer.\nThe user can specify that the IOB function generator be\nused by placing special libra ry symbols beginning with the\nletter "O." For example, a 2-input AND gate in the IOB func-tion generator is called OAND2. Use the symbol input pinlabeled "F" for the signal on the critical path. This signal isplaced on the OK pin — the IOB input with the shortestdelay to the function generator. Two examples are shown inFigure 7 .\nOutput Buffer\nAn active High 3-state signal can be used to place the out-\nput buffer in a high-impedance state, implementing 3-stateoutputs or bidirectional I/O. Under configuration control, theoutput (O) and output 3-state (T) signals can be inverted.The polarity of these signals is independently configured foreach IOB (see Figure 6, page 7 ). An output can be config-\nured as open-drain (open-collector) by tying the 3-state pin(T) to the output signal, and the input pin (I) to Ground.By default, a 5V Spartan device output buffer pull-up struc-\nture is configured as a TTL-like totem-pole. The High driveris an n-channel pull-up transi stor, pulling to a voltage one\ntransistor threshold below V\nCC. Alternatively, the outputs\ncan be globally configured as CMOS drivers, with additionalp-channel pull-up transistors pulling to V\nCC. This option,\napplied using the bitstream generation software, applies toall outputs on the device. It is not individually programma-ble. \nAll Spartan-XL device outputs are configured as CMOS\ndrivers, therefore driving rail-to-rail. The Spartan-XL familyoutputs are individually programmable for 12 mA or 24 mAoutput drive.\nAny 5V Spartan device with its outputs configured in TTL\nmode can drive the inputs of any typical 3.3V device. Sup-ported destinations for Spartan/XL device outputs areshown in Table 7 .\nThree-State Register (Spartan-XL Family Only)\nSpartan-XL devices incorporate an optional register control-\nling the three-state enable in the IOBs. The use of thethree-state control register can significantly improve outputenable and disable time.\nOutput Slew Rate\nThe slew rate of each output buffer is, by default, reduced,\nto minimize power bus transients when switching non-criti-cal signals. For critical signals, attach a FAST attribute orproperty to the output buffer or flip-flop.\nSpartan/XL devices have a feature called "Soft Start-up,"\ndesigned to reduce ground bounce when all outputs areturned on simultaneously at the end of configuration.When the configuration process is finished and the devicestarts up, the first activation of the outputs is automaticallyslew-rate limited. Immediately fo llowing the initial activation\nof the I/O, the slew rate of the individual outputs is deter-mined by the individual configuration option for each IOB. \nPull-up and Pull-down Network\nProgrammable pull-up and pull-down resistors are used for\ntying unused pins to V\nCC or Ground to minimize power con-\nsumption and reduce noise sensitivity. The configurablepull-up resistor is a p-channel transistor that pulls to V\nCC.\nThe configurable pull-down resistor is an n-channel transis-tor that pulls to Ground. The value of these resistors is typi-cally 20 K Ω −  100 K Ω (See "Spartan Family DC\nCharacteristics Over Operating Conditions" on page 43. ).Figure 7:  AND and MUX Symbols in Spartan-XL IOB \nDS060_07_081100OAND2OMUX2\nFD0\nD1O\nS0\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\n10 www.xilinx.com DS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nThis high value makes them  unsuitable as wired-AND\npull-up resistors.\nAfter configuration, voltage levels of unused pads, bonded\nor unbonded, must be valid logic levels, to reduce noisesensitivity and avoid excess current. Therefore, by default,unused pads are configured with the internal pull-up resistoractive. Alternatively, they can be individually configured withthe pull-down resistor, or as a driven output, or to be drivenby an external source. To activate the internal pull-up, attachthe PULLUP library component to the net attached to thepad. To activate the internal pull-down, attach the PULL-DOWN library component to the net attached to the pad.\nSet/Reset\nAs with the CLB registers, the GSR signal can be used to\nset or clear the input and output registers, depending on thevalue of the INIT attribute or property. The two flip-flops canbe individually configured to set or clear on reset and afterconfiguration. Other than the global GSR net, no user-con-trolled set/reset signal is available to the I/O flip-flops(Figure 5 ). The choice of set or reset applies to both the ini-\ntial state of the flip-flop and the response to the GSR pulse.\nIndependent Clocks\nSeparate clock signals are provided for the input (IK) and\noutput (OK) flip-flops. The clock can be independentlyinverted for each flip-flop within the IOB, generating eitherfalling-edge or rising-edge tr iggered flip-flops. The clock\ninputs for each IOB are independent.\nCommon Clock Enables\nThe input and output flip-flops in each IOB have a common\nclock enable input (see EC signal in Figure 5 ), which\nthrough configuration, can be activated individually for theinput or output flip-flop, or both. This clock enable operatesexactly like the EC signal on the Spartan/XL FPGA CLB. Itcannot be inverted within the IOB. \nRouting Channel Description\nAll internal routing channels are composed of metal seg-ments with programmable swit ching points and switching\nmatrices to implement the desired routing. A structured,hierarchical matrix of routing channels is provided toachieve efficient automated routing.\nThis section describes the routing channels available in\nSpartan/XL devices. Figure 8  shows a general block dia-\ngram of the CLB routing channels. The implementation soft-ware automatically assigns the appropriate resourcesbased on the density and timing requirements of the design.The following description of the routing channels is for infor-mation only and is simplified with some minor details omit-\nted. For an exact interconnect description the designershould open a design in the FPGA Editor and review theactual connections in this tool.\nThe routing channels will be discussed as follows;\x81 CLB routing channels which run along each row and \ncolumn of the CLB array.\n\x81 IOB routing channels which form a ring (called a \nVersaRing) around the outside of the CLB array. It connects the I/O with the CLB routing channels.\n\x81 Global routing consists of dedicated networks primarily \ndesigned to distribute clocks throughout the device with \nminimum delay and skew. Global routing can also be \nused for other high-fanout signals.\nCLB Routing Channels \nThe routing channels around the CLB are derived fromthree types of interconnects; single-length, double-length,and longlines. At the intersection of each vertical and hori-zontal routing channel is a signal steering matrix called aProgrammable Switch Matrix (PSM). Figure 8  shows the\nbasic routing channel configuration showing single-lengthlines, double-length lines and longlines as well as the CLBsand PSMs. The CLB to routing channel interface is shownas well as how the PSMs interface at the channel intersec-tions.Table  7:  Supported Destinations for Spartan/XL \nOutputs\nDestinationSpartan-XL \nOutputsSpartan\nOutputs\n3.3V, CMOS5V,\nTTL5V, \nCMOS\nAny device, \nV\nCC = 3.3V, \nCMOS-threshold inputs√√ Some\n(1)\nAny device, \nVCC = 5V, \nTTL-threshold inputs √√ √\nAny device, \nVCC = 5V, \nCMOS-threshold inputsUnreliable \nData√\nNotes: \n1.

The input signals to the CLB are distributed evenly\non all four sides providing maximum routing flexibility. Ingeneral, the entire architecture is symmetrical and regular.It is well suited to established placement and routing algo-rithms. Inputs, outputs, and function generators can freelyswap positions within a CLB to avoid routing congestionduring the placement and routing operation. The exceptionsare the clock (K) input and CIN/COUT signals. The K inputis routed to dedicated global vertical lines as well as foursingle-length lines and is on the left side of the CLB. TheCIN/COUT signals are routed through dedicated intercon-nects which do not interfere with the general routing struc-ture. The output signals from the CLB\n are available to drive\nboth vertical and horizontal channels.Programmable Switch Matrices \nThe horizontal and vertical single- and double-length lines\nintersect at a box called a programmable switch matrix\n(PSM). Each PSM consists of programmable pass transis-tors used to establish connections between the lines (seeFigure 10 ). \nFor example, a single-length signal entering on the right\nside of the switch matrix can be routed to a single-lengthline on the top, left, or bottom sides, or any combinationthereof, if multiple branches are required. Similarly, a dou-ble-length signal can be routed to a double-length line onany or all of the other three edges of the programmableswitch matrix.\nSingle-Length Lines \nSingle-length lines provide the greatest interconnect flexibil-\nity and offer fast routing between adjacent blocks. There areeight vertical and eight horizontal single-length lines associ-ated with each CLB. These lines connect the switchingmatrices that are located in every row and column of CLBs.Single-length lines are connected by way of the program-mable switch matrices, as shown in Figure 10 . Routing con-\nnectivity is shown in Figure 8 .\nSingle-length lines incur a delay whenever they go through\na PSM. Therefore, they are not suitable for routing signalsfor long distances. They are normally used to conduct sig-nals within a localized area and to provide the branching fornets with fanout greater than one.Figure 8:  Spartan/XL CLB Routing Channels and Interface Block DiagramPSM\nCLB CLBPSM PSM\nPSM PSM PSM8 Singles\n2 Doubles\n3 Longs\n3 Longs\n2 Doubles\n2 Doubles 3 Longs 3 Longs 2 Doubles 8 Singles\nDS060_09_041901\nFigure 9:  CLB Interconnect SignalsCIN Y\nG3\nC3\nF3COUT\nG1\nC1\nK\nF1\nX\nXQ\nF4\nC4\nG4\nYQF2\nC2\nG2CLB\nDS060_08_081100Rev 1.1\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\n12 www.xilinx.com DS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nDouble-Length Lines \nThe double-length lines consist of a grid of metal segments,\neach twice as long as the single-length lines: they run pasttwo CLBs before entering a PSM. Double-length lines aregrouped in pairs with the PSMs staggered, so that each linegoes through a PSM at every other row or column of CLBs(see Figure 8 ). \nThere are four vertical and four horizontal double-length\nlines associated with each CLB. These lines provide fastersignal routing over intermediate distances, while retainingrouting flexibility.\nLonglines \nLonglines form a grid of metal interconnect segments that\nrun the entire length or width of the array. Longlines areintended for high fan-out, time-critical signal nets, or netsthat are distributed over long distances.\nEach Spartan/XL device longline has a programmable split-\nter switch at its center. This switch can separa te the line into\ntwo independent routing channels, each running half the\nwidth or height of the array.   \nRouting connectivity of the longlines is shown in Figure 8 .\nThe longlines also interface to some 3-state buffers which isdescribed later in 3-State Long Line Drivers , page 19 .I/O Routing\nSpartan/XL devices have additional routing around the IOB\nring. This routing is called a VersaRing. The VersaRing facil-\nitates pin-swapping and redesign without affecting boardlayout. Included are eight double-length lines, and four long-lines. \nGlobal Nets and Buffers\nThe Spartan/XL devices have dedicated global networks.These networks are designed to distribute clocks and otherhigh fanout control signals throughout the devices with min-imal skew.\nFour vertical longlines in each CLB column are driven exclu-\nsively by special global buffers. These longlines are in addi-tion to the vertical longlines used for standard interconnect.In the 5V Spartan devices, the four global lines can bedriven by either of two types of global buffers; PrimaryGlobal buffers (BUFGP) or Secondary Global buffers(BUFGS). Each of these lines can be accessed by one par-ticular Primary Global buffer, or by any of the Secondary\nGlobal buffers, as shown in Figure 11 . In the 3V\nSpartan-XL devices, the four global lines can be driven byany of the eight Global Low-Skew Buffers (BUFGLS). Theclock pins of every CLB and IOB can also be sourced fromlocal interconnect.Figure 10:  Programmable Switch Matrix\nSix Pass Transistors Per\nSwitch Matrix Interconnect Point\nDS060_10_081100\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 13\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nThe four Primary Global buffers offer the shortest delay and\nnegligible skew. Four Secondary Global buffers haveslightly longer delay and slight ly more skew due to poten-\ntially heavier loading, but of fer greater flexibility when used\nto drive non-clock CLB inputs. The eight Global Low-Skewbuffers in the Spartan-XL devices combine short delay, neg-ligible skew, and flexibility.\nThe Primary Global buffers must be driven by the semi-ded-\nicated pads (PGCK1-4). The Secondary Global buffers can\nbe sourced by either semi-dedicated pads (SGCK1-4) orinternal nets. Each corner of the device has one Primarybuffer and one Secondary buffer. The Spartan-XL familyhas eight global low-skew buffers, two in each corner. Allcan be sourced by either semi-dedicated pads (GCK1-8) orinternal nets.\nUsing the library symbol called BUFG results in the software\nchoosing the appropriate clock buffer, based on the timingrequirements of the design. A global buffer should be spec-ified for all timing-sensitive global signal distribution. To usea global buffer, place a BUFGP (primary buffer), BUFGS(secondary buffer), BUFGLS (Spartan-XL family globallow-skew buffer), or BUFG (any buffer type) element in aschematic or in HDL code.Advanced Features Description\nDistributed RAM\nOptional modes for each CLB allow the function generators(F-LUT and G-LUT) to be used as Random Access Memory(RAM). \nRead and write operations are significantly faster for this\non-chip RAM than for off-chip implementations. This speed\nadvantage is due to the relatively short signal propagation\ndelays within the FPGA.\nMemory Configuration Overview\nThere are two available memory configuration modes: sin-gle-port RAM and dual-port RAM. For both these modes,write operations are synchronous (edge-triggered), whileread operations are asynchronous. In the single-port mode,a single CLB can be configured as either a 16 x 1, (16 x 1)x 2, or 32 x 1 RAM array. In the dual-port mode, a singleCLB can be configured only as one 16 x 1 RAM array. Thedifferent CLB memory configurations are summarized inTable 8 . Any of these possibilities can be individually pro-\ngrammed into a Spartan/XL FPGA CLB.

One 4-bit address decoder determines the RAM location for write and read operations. There is one input for writing data and one output for reading data, all at the selected address. \n\x81 The (16 x 1) x 2 single-port configuration combines two \n16 x 1 single-port configurations (each according to the preceding description). There is one data input, one data output and one address decoder for each array. These arrays can be addressed independently.\n\x81 The 32 x 1 single-port configuration contains a RAM \narray with 32 locations, each one-bit wide. There is one data input, one data output, and one 5-bit address decoder.\n\x81 The dual-port mode 16 x 1 configuration contains a \nRAM array with 16 locations, each one-bit wide. There are two 4-bit address decoders, one for each port. One port consists of an input for writing and an output for reading, all at a selected address. The other port consists of one output for reading from an independently selected address.\nThe appropriate choice of RAM configuration mode for a\ngiven design should be based on timing and resourcerequirements, desired functionality, and the simplicity of thedesign process. Selection criteria include the following:Whereas the 32 x 1 single-port, the (16 x 1) x 2 single-port,and the 16 x 1 dual-port configurations each use one entireCLB, the 16 x 1 single-port configuration uses only one halfof a CLB. Due to its simultan eous read/write capability, the\ndual-port RAM can transfer twice as much data as the sin-gle-port RAM, which permits only one data operation at anygiven time. \nCLB memory configuration options are selected by using\nthe appropriate library symbol in the design entry.\nSingle-Port Mode \nThere are three CLB memory configurations for the sin-\ngle-port RAM: 16 x 1, (16 x 1) x 2, and 32 x 1, the functionalorganization of which is shown in Figure 12 . \nThe single-port RAM signals and the CLB signals ( Figure 2,\npage 4 ) from which they are originally derived are shown in\nTable 9 .Writing data to the single-por t RAM is essentially the same\nas writing to a data register. It is an edge-triggered (syn-chronous) operation performed by applying an address tothe A inputs and data to the D input during the active edgeof WCLK while WE is High. \nThe timing relationships are shown in Figure 13 . The High\nlogic level on WE enables the input data register for writing.\nThe active edge of WCLK latches the address, input data,and WE signals. Then, an internal write pulse is generatedthat loads the data into the memory cell.

While the WCLK input to the\nRAM accepts the same signal as the clock input to the asso-ciated CLB’s flip-flops, the sense of this WCLK input can beinverted with respect to the sense of the flip-flop clock\ninputs. Consequently, within the same CLB, data at theRAM SPO line can be stored in a flip-flop with either thesame or the inverse clock polarity used to write data to theRAM.\nThe WE input is active High and cannot be inverted within\nthe CLB.\nAllowing for settling time, the data on the SPO output\nreflects the contents of the RAM location currentlyaddressed. When the address changes, following the asyn-chronous delay T\nILO, the data stored at the new address\nlocation will appear on SPO. If t he data at a particular RAM\naddress is overwritten, after the delay TWOS, the new data\nwill appear on SPO.\nDual-Port Mode \nIn dual-port mode, the function generators (F-LUT and\nG-LUT) are used to create a 16 x 1 dual-port memory. Ofthe two data ports available, one permits read and writeoperations at the address specified by A[3:0] while the sec-ond provides only for read operations at the address speci-fied independently by DPRA[3:0]. As a result, simultaneousread/write operations at different addresses (or even at thesame address) are supported. \nThe functional organization of the 16 x 1 dual-port RAM is\nshown in Figure 14 .

Single Port Out (SPO) serves as the data outputfor the lower memory. Therefore, SPO reflects the data ataddress A[3:0].\nThe other address port, labeled DPRA[3:0] for Dual Port\nRead Address, supplies the read address for the uppermemory. The write address for this memory, however,comes from the address A[3:0]. Dual Port Out (DPO) servesas the data output for the upper memory. Therefore, DPOreflects the data at address DPRA[3:0].\nBy using A[3:0] for the write address and DPRA[3:0] for the\nread address, and reading only the DPO output, a FIFO thatcan read and write simultaneously is easily generated. Thesimultaneous read/write c apability possible with the\ndual-port RAM can provide twice the effective data through-put of a single-port RAM alternating read and write opera-tions.\nThe timing relationships for the dual-port RAM mode are\nshown in Figure 13 . \nNote that write operations to RAM are synchronous\n(edge-triggered); however, data access is asynchronous.\nInitializing RAM at FPGA Configuration \nBoth RAM and ROM implementations in the Spartan/XL\nfamilies are initialized during devi ce configuration. The initial\ncontents are defined via an INIT attribute or propertyattached to the RAM or ROM symbol, as described in the\nlibrary guide. If not defined, all RAM contents are initializedto zeros, by default. \nRAM initialization occurs only  during device configuration.\nThe RAM content is not affected by GSR.\nMore Information on Using RAM Inside CLBs\nThree application note s are available from Xilinx that dis-\ncuss synchronous (edge-triggered) RAM: "Xilinx Edge-Trig-\ngered and Dual-Port RAM Capability," "Implementing FIFOsin Xilinx RAM,"  and "Synchronous and Asynchronous FIFO\nDesigns."  All three application notes apply to both the Spar-\ntan and the Spartan-XL families.\nFast Carry Logic\nEach CLB F-LUT and G-LUT contains dedicated arithmeticlogic for the fast generation of carry and borrow signals.This extra output is passed on to the function generator inthe adjacent CLB. The carry chain is independent of normalrouting resources. (See Figure 15 .)\nDedicated fast carry logic greatly increases the efficiency\nand performance of adders, subtractors, accumulators,comparators and counters. It also opens the door to manynew applications involving arithmetic operation, where theprevious generations of FPGAs were not fast enough or tooinefficient. High-speed address offset calculations in micro-processor or graphics systems, and high-speed addition indigital signal processing are two typical applications. \nThe two 4-input function generators can be configured as a\n2-bit adder with built-in hidden carry that can be expandedto any length. This dedicated carry circuitry is so fast andefficient that conventional speed-up methods like carry gen-erate/propagate are meaningless even at the 16-bit level,and of marginal benefit at the 32-bit level. This fast carrylogic is one of the more significant features of the SpartanTable  10:  Dual-Port RAM Signals\nRAM Signal Function CLB Signal\nD Data In DIN\n \nA[3:0] Read Address for \nSingle-Port.\nWrite Address for \nSingle-Port and \nDual-Port.F[4:1]\nDPRA[3:0] Read Address for \nDual-PortG[4:1]\nWE Write Enable SR \nWCLK Clock K\nSPO Single Port Out\n(addressed by A[3:0])FOUT\nDPO Dual Port Out\n(addressed by \nDPRA[3:0]) GOUT\nFigure 15:  Available Spartan/XL Carry Propagation \nPathsCLB CLB CLB CLB\nCLB CLB CLB CLB\nCLB CLB CLB CLB\nCLB CLB CLB CLB\nDS060_15_081100\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 17\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nand Spartan-XL familie s, speeding up arithmetic and count-\ning functions.\nThe carry chain in 5V Spartan devices can run either up or\ndown. At the top and bottom of the columns where there areno CLBs above and below, the carry is propagated to theright. The default is always to propagate up the column, asshown in the figures. The carry chain in Spartan-XL devicescan only run up the column, providing even higher speed.\nFigure 16, page 18  shows a Spartan/XL FPGA CLB with\ndedicated fast carry logic. The carry logic shares operandand control inputs with the function generators. The carry\noutputs connect to the function generators, where they arecombined with the operands to form the sums.\nFigure 17, page 19  shows the details of the Spartan/XL\nFPGA carry logic.

These 3-state buffers (BUFT) can be used to drivesignals onto the nearest horizontal longlines above andbelow the CLB. They can therefore be used to implementmultiplexed or bidirectional buses on the horizontal long-lines, saving logic resources.\nThere is a weak keeper at each end of these two horizontal\nlonglines. This circuit prevents undefined floating levels.However, it is overridden by any driver.\nThe buffer enable is an active High 3-state (i.e., an active\nLow enable), as shown in Table 11 .Three-State Buffer Example\nFigure 18  shows how to use the 3-state buffers to imple-\nment a multiplexer.

This oscil-\nlator is used to clock the power-on time-out, for configura-tion memory clearing, and as the source of CCLK in Masterconfiguration mode. The oscilla tor runs at a nominal 8 MHz\nfrequency that varies with process, V\nCC, and temperature.\nThe output frequency falls between 4 MHz and 10 MHz. \nThe oscillator output is optiona lly available after configura-\ntion. Any two of four resynchronized taps of a built-in dividerare also available. These taps are at the fourth, ninth, four-teenth and nineteenth bits of the divider. Therefore, if theprimary oscillator ou tput is running at the nominal 8 MHz,\nthe user has access to an 8-MHz clock, plus any two of500 kHz, 16 kHz, 490 Hz and 15 Hz. These frequenciescan vary by as much as -50% or +25%.\nThese signals can be accessed by placing the OSC4 library\nelement in a schematic or in  HDL code. The oscillator is\nautomatically disabled after configuration if the OSC4 sym-bol is not used in the design.\nGlobal Signals: GSR and GTS\nGlobal Set/Reset\nA separate Global Set/Reset line, as shown in Figure 3,\npage 5  for the CLB and Figure 5, page 6  for the IOB, sets or\nclears each flip-flop during power-up, reconfiguration, orwhen a dedicated Reset net is driven active. This global net(GSR) does not compete with other routing resources; ituses a dedicated distribution network. \nEach flip-flop is configured as either globally set or reset in\nthe same way that the local set/reset (SR) is specified.\nTherefore, if a flip-flop is set by SR, it is also set by GSR.Similarly, if in reset mode, it  is reset by both SR and GSR.\nGSR can be driven from any user-programmable pin as a\nglobal reset input. To use this global net, place an input padand input buffer in the schematic or HDL code, driving theGSR pin of the STARTUP symbol. (See Figure 19 .) A spe-\ncific pin location can be assigned to this input using a LOCattribute or property, just as with any other user-program-mable pad. An inverter can optionally be inserted after theinput buffer to invert the sense of the GSR signal. Alterna-tively, GSR can be driven from any internal node.\nGlobal 3-State \nA separate Global 3-state line (GTS) as shown in Figure 6,\npage 7  forces all FPGA outputs to the high-impedance\nstate, unless boundary scan is enabled and is executing anEXTEST instruction. GTS does not compete with other rout-ing resources; it uses a dedicated distribution network.\nGTS can be driven from any user-programmable pin as a\nglobal 3-state input. To use this global net, place an inputpad and input buffer in the schematic or HDL code, drivingthe GTS pin of the STARTUP symbol. This is similar to whatis shown in Figure 19  for GSR except the IBUF would beconnected to GTS. A specific pin location can be assigned\nto this input using a LOC attribute or property, just as withany other user-programmable pad. An inverter can option-ally be inserted after the input buffer to invert the sense ofthe Global 3-state signal. Alternatively, GTS can be drivenfrom any internal node.\nBoundary Scan\nThe "bed of nails" has been the traditional method of testingelectronic assemblies. This approach has become lessappropriate, due to closer pin spacing and more sophisti-cated assembly methods like surface-mount technologyand multi-layer boards. The IEEE Boundary Scan Standard\n1149.1 was developed to facilitate board-level testing ofelectronic assemblies. Design and test engineers canembed a standard test logic structure in their device toachieve high fault coverage for I/O and internal logic. Thisstructure is easily implemented with a four-pin interface onany boundary scan compatib le device. IEEE 1149.1-com-\npatible devices may be serial daisy-chained together, con-nected in parallel, or a combination of the two.\nThe Spartan and Spartan-XL families implement IEEE\n1149.1-compatible BYP ASS, PRELOAD/SAMPLE and\nEXTEST boundary scan instructions.   When the boundaryscan configuration option is selected, three normal user I/Opins become dedicated inputs for these functions. Anotheruser output pin becomes the dedicated boundary scan out-put. The details of how to enable this circuitry are coveredlater in this section.\nBy exercising these input signal s, the user can serially load\ncommands and data into these devices to control the drivingof their outputs and to examine their inputs. This method isan improvement over bed-of-nails testing. It avoids the needto over-drive device outputs, and it reduces the user inter-face to four pins. An optional fifth pin, a reset for the controllogic, is described in the standard but is not implemented inthe Spartan/XL devices. \nThe dedicated on-chip logic implementing the IEEE 1149.1\nfunctions includes a 16-state machine, an instruction regis-ter and a number of data registers. The functional detailscan be found in the IEEE 1149 .1 specification and are also\ndiscussed in the Xilin x application note: " Boundary Scan in\nFPGA Devices ."

See Configuration Through the\nBoundary Scan Pins , page 37 .\nData Registers\nThe primary data register is the boundary scan register. For\neach IOB pin in the FPGA, bonded or not, it includes threebits for In, Out and 3-state Control. Non-IOB pins haveappropriate partial bit population for In or Out only. PRO-\nGRAM , CCLK and DONE are not included in the boundary\nscan register. Each EXTEST CAPTURE-DR state capturesall In, Out, and 3-state pins.  \nThe data register also includes the following non-pin bits:\nTDO.T, and TDO.O, which are always bits 0 and 1 of thedata register, respectively, and BSCANT.UPD, which isalways the last bit of the data register. These three bound-ary scan bits are special-purp ose Xilinx test signals.    The other standard data register is the single flip-flop\nBYPASS register. It synchronizes data being passedthrough the FPGA to the next downstream boundary scandevice.\nThe FPGA provides two additional data registers that can\nbe specified using the BSCAN macro. The FPGA providestwo user pins (BSCAN.SEL1 and BSCAN.SEL2) which are\nthe decodes of two user instructions. For these instructions,two corresponding pins (BSCAN.TDO1 and BSCAN.TDO2)allow user scan data to be shifted out on TDO. The dataregister clock (BSCAN.DRCK) is available for control of testlogic which the user may wish to implement with CLBs. TheNAND of TCK and RUN-TEST -IDLE is also provided(BSCAN.IDLE).\nInstruction Set\nThe Spartan/XL FPGA boundary scan instruction set alsoincludes instructions to configure the device and read backthe configuration data.

The\ninput-only pins contribute only the In bit to the boundaryscan I/O data register, while the output-only pins contributesall three bits. \nThe first two bits in the I/O data register are TDO.T and\nTDO.O, which can be used for the capture of internal sig-nals. The final bit is BSCANT.UPD, which can be used todrive an internal net. These locations are primarily used byXilinx for internal testing.\nFrom a cavity-up view of th e chip (as shown in the FPGA\nEditor), starting in the upper right chip corner, the boundaryscan data-register bits are ordered as shown in Figure 21 .\nThe device-specific pinout tables for the Spartan/XL devicesinclude the boundary scan locations for each IOB pin.BSDL (Boundary Scan Description Language) files for\nSpartan/XL devices are availa ble on the Xilinx website in\nthe File Download area. Note that the 5V Spartan devicesand 3V Spartan-XL devices have different BSDL files.\nIncluding Boundary Scan in a Design\nIf boundary scan is only to be used during configuration, nospecial elements need be included in the schematic or HDLcode. In this case, the special boundary scan pins TDI,TMS, TCK and TDO can be used for user functions afterconfiguration.\nTo indicate that boundary scan remain enabled after config-\nuration, place the BSCAN library symbol and connect theTDI, TMS, TCK and TDO pad symbols to the appropriatepins, as shown in Figure 22 .Table  12:  Boundary Scan Instructions\nInstructionTest \nSelectedTDO \nSourceI/O Data\nSource I2 I1 I0\n0 0 0 EXTEST DR DR0 0 1 SAMPLE/\nPRELOADDR Pin/Logic\n0 1 0 USER 1 BSCAN.\nTDO1User Logic\n0 1 1 USER 2 BSCAN.\nTDO2User Logic\n1 0 0 READBACK Readback \nDataPin/Logic\n1 0 1 CONFIGURE DOUT Disabled\n110 I D C O D E  \n(Spartan-XL \nonly)IDCODE \nRegister-\n1 1 1 BYPASS Bypass \nRegister-Figure 21:   Boundary Scan Bit Sequence\nFigure 22:  Boundary Scan ExampleBit 0 ( TDO end)\nBit 1Bit 2TDO.T\nTDO.O\nTop-edge IOBs (Right to Left)\nLeft-edge IOBs (Top to Bottom)\nMODE.I\nBottom-edge IOBs (Left to Right)\nRight-edge IOBs (Bottom to Top)\nBSCANT.UPD (TDI end)\nDS060_21_080400\nTDI\nTMSTCKTDO1TDO2TDO\nDRCK\nIDLE\nSEL1SEL2TDI\nTMS\nTCKTDOBSCANTo User\nLogic\nIBUFOptional\nFrom\nUser LogicTo User\nLogic\nDS060_22_080400\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\n24 www.xilinx.com DS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nEven if the boundary scan symbol is used in a design, the\ninput pins TMS, TCK, and TD I can still be used as inputs to\nbe routed to internal logic. Care must be taken not to forcethe chip into an undesired boundary scan state by inadver-tently applying boundary scan input patterns to these pins.The simplest way to prevent this is to keep TMS High, andthen apply whatever signal is desired to TDI and TCK.\nAvoiding Inadvertent Boundary Scan\nIf TMS or TCK is used as user I/O, care must be taken to\nensure that at least one of these pins is held constant duringconfiguration. In some applications, a situation may occurwhere TMS or TCK is driven during configuration. This maycause the device to go into boundary scan mode and dis-rupt the configuration process. \nTo prevent activation of boundary scan during configuration,\ndo either of the following:\n\x81 TMS: Tie High to put the Test Access Port controller\nin a benign RESET state.\n\x81 TCK: Tie High or Low—do not toggle this clock input.\nFor more information regarding boundary scan, refer to the\nXilinx Application Note, " Boundary Scan in FPGA Devices . " \nBoundary Scan Enhancements (Spartan-XL Family \nOnly)\nSpartan-XL devices have improved boundary scan func-\ntionality and performance in the following areas:\nIDCODE:  The IDCODE register is supported. By using the\nIDCODE, the device connected to the JTAG port can bedetermined. The use of the IDCODE enables selective con-figuration dependent on the FPGA found.\nThe IDCODE register has th e following binary format:\nvvvv:ffff:fffa:aaaa:aaaa:cccc:cccc:ccc1\nwhere\nc = the company code (49h for Xilinx)a = the array dimension in CLBs (ranges from 0Ah for \nXCS05XL to 1Ch for XCS40XL)\nf = the family code (02h for Spartan-XL family)v = the die version numberConfiguration State:  The configuration state is available to\nJTAG controllers.\nConfiguration Disable:  The JTAG port can be prevented\nfrom configuring the FPGA.\nTCK Startup:  TCK can now be used to clock the start-up\nblock in addition to other user clocks.\nCCLK Holdoff:  Changed the requirement for Boundary\nScan Configure or EXTEST to be issued prior to the releaseof INIT pin and CCLK cycling.\nReissue Configure:  The Boundary Scan Configure can be\nreissued to recover from an unfinished attempt to configurethe device.\nBypass FF:  Bypass FF and IOB is modified to provide\nDRCLOCK only during BYPASS for the bypass flip-flop, andduring EXTEST or SAMPLE/PR ELOAD for the IOB register.\nPower-Down (Spartan-XL Family Only)\nAll Spartan/XL devices use a combination of efficient seg-\nmented routing and advanced process technology to pro-vide low power consumption under all conditions. The 3.3VSpartan-XL family adds a dedicated active Low power-downpin (PWRDWN\n) to reduce supply current to 100 μA typical.\nThe PWRDWN  pin takes advantage of one of the unused\nNo Connect locations on the 5V Spartan device. The usermust de-select the "5V Tolerant I/Os" option in the Configu-ration Options to achieve the specified Power Down current.The PWRDWN\n pin has a default internal pull-up resistor,\nallowing it to be left unconnected if unused.\nVCC must continue to be supplied during Power-down, and\nconfiguration data is ma intained. When the PWRDWN  pin is\npulled Low, the input and output buffers are disabled. Theinputs are internally forced to a logic Low level, including the\nMODE pins, DONE, CCLK, and TDO, and all internalpull-up resistors are turned off. The PROGRAM\n pin is not\naffected by Power Down. The GSR net is asserted duringPower Down, initializing all the flip-flops to their start-up\nstate.\nPWRDWN\n has a minimum pulse width of 50 ns ( Figure 23 ).\nOn entering the Power-down state, the inputs will be dis-\nabled and the flip-flops set/reset, and then the outputs aredisabled about 10 ns later. The user may prefer to assert theGTS or GSR signals before PWRDWN\n to affect the order of\nevents. When the PWRDWN  signal is returned High, the\ninputs will be enabled first, followed immediately by therelease of the GSR signal initia lizing the flip-flops. About 10\nns later, the outputs will be enab led. Allow 50 ns after the\nrelease of PWRDWN\n before using the device.

All inputs are interpreted as\nLow, but the internal combinator ial logic is fully functional.\nMake sure that the combination of all inputs Low and allflip-flops set or reset in your  design will not generate internal\noscillations, or create perman ent bus contention by activat-\ning internal bus drivers with conflicting data onto the samelong line.\nDuring configuration, the PWRDWN\n pin must be High. If the\nPower Down state is entered before or during configuration,the device will restart configuration once the PWRDWN\n sig-\nnal is removed. Note that the configuration pins are affectedby Power Down and may not reflect their normal function. Ifthere is an external pull-up re sistor on the DONE pin, it will\nbe High during Power Down even if the device is not yetconfigured. Similarly, if PWRDWN\n is asserted before config-\nuration is completed, the INIT  pin will not indicate status\ninformation.\nNote that the PWRDWN  pin is not part of the Boundary\nScan chain. Therefore, the Spartan-XL family has a sepa-rate set of BSDL files than the 5V Spartan family. Boundaryscan logic is not usable during Power Down.\nConfiguration and Test\nConfiguration is the process of loading design-specific pro-gramming data into one or more FPGAs to define the func-tional operation of the internal blocks and theirinterconnections. This is somewhat like loading the com-mand registers of a programmable peripheral chip.Spartan/XL  devices use several hundred bits of configura-tion data per CLB and its associated interconnects. Eachconfiguration bit defines the state of a static memory cellthat controls either a function look-up table bit, a multiplexer\ninput, or an interconnect pass  transistor. The Xilinx develop-\nment system translates the design into a netlist file. It auto-matically partitions, places and routes the logic andgenerates the configuration data in PROM format. \nConfiguration Mode Control\n5V Spartan devices have two configuration modes.\n\x81 MODE = 1 sets Slave Serial mode\n\x81 MODE = 0 sets Master Serial mode\n3V Spartan-XL devices have three configuration modes.\n\x81 M1/M0 = 11 sets Slave Serial mode\n\x81 M1/M0 = 10 sets Master Serial mode\n\x81 M1/M0 = 0X sets Express mode\nIn addition to these modes, the device can be configured\nthrough the Boundary Scan logic ( See "Configuration\nThrough the Boundary Scan Pins" on page 37. ).\nThe Mode pins are sampled prior to starting configuration to\ndetermine the configuration mode. After configuration,these pin are unused. The Mode pins have a weak pull-upresistor turned on during configuration. With the Mode pinsHigh, Slave Serial mode is selected, which is the most pop-ular configuration mode. Therefore, for the most commonconfiguration mode, the Mode pins can be left unconnected.If the Master Serial mode is desired, the MODE/M0 pinshould be connected directly to GND, or through apull-down resistor of 1 K Ω or less.\nDuring configuration, some of the I/O pins are used tempo-\nrarily for the configuration process.

The CCLK speed is selectable as either 1 MHz(default) or 8 MHz. Configuration always starts at the defaultslow frequency, then can switch to the higher frequency dur-ing the first frame. Frequency tolerance is –50% to +25%.\nIn Master Serial mode, the CCLK output of the device drives\na Xilinx SPROM that feeds the FPGA DIN input. Each risingedge of the CCLK output increments the Serial PROM inter-nal address counter. The next data bit is put on the SPROMdata output, connected to the FPGA DIN pin. The FPGAaccepts this data on the subsequent rising CCLK edge.\nWhen used in a daisy-chain configuration the Master Serial\nFPGA is placed as the first device in the chain and isreferred to as the lead FPGA. The lead FPGA presents thepreamble data, and all data that overflows the lead device,on its DOUT pin. There is an internal pipeline delay of 1.5CCLK periods, which means t hat DOUT changes on thefalling CCLK edge, and the next  FPGA in the daisy chain\naccepts data on the subsequent rising CCLK edge. See thetiming diagram in Figure 24 .\nIn the bitstream generation software, the user can specify\nFast Configuration Rate, which, starting several bits into the\nfirst frame, increases the CCLK frequency by a factor ofeight. For actual timing values please refer to the specifica-tion section. Be sure that the serial PROM and slaves arefast enough to support this data rate. Earlier families such\nas the XC3000 series do not support the Fast ConfigurationRate option.\nThe SPROM CE input can be driven from either LDC\n or\nDONE. Using LDC  avoids potential contention on the DIN\npin, if this pin is configured as user I/O, but LDC  is then\nrestricted to be a permanently High user output after config-uration. Using DONE can also avoid contention on DIN, pro-\nvided the Early DONE option is invoked. \nFigure 25  shows a full master/slave system. The leftmost\ndevice is in Master Serial mode, all other devices in thechain are in Slave Serial mode.\nSlave Serial Mode\nIn Slave Serial mode, the FPGA receives serial configura-tion data on the rising edge of CCLK and, after loading itsconfiguration, passes additional data out, resynchronizedon the next falling edge of CCLK. \nIn this mode, an external signal drives the CCLK input of the\nFPGA (most often from a Master Serial device). The serialconfiguration bitstream must be available at the DIN input ofthe lead FPGA a short setup time before each rising CCLKedge. The lead FPGA then presents the preamble data—and all\ndata that overflows the lead device—on its DOUT pin. Thereis an internal delay of 0.5 CCLK periods, which means thatDOUT changes on the fallin g CCLK edge, and the next\nFPGA in the daisy chain accepts data on the subsequentrising CCLK edge. \nFigure 25  shows a full master/slave system.

In this way, multiple devices\ncan be configured simultaneously. \nSerial Daisy Chain\nMultiple devices with different configurations can be con-nected together in a "daisy chain," and a single combinedbitstream used to configure the chain of slave devices. \nTo configure a daisy chain of devices, wire the CCLK pins of\nall devices in parallel, as shown in Figure 25 . Connect the\nDOUT of each device to the DIN of the next. The lead ormaster FPGA and following slaves each passes resynchro-nized configuration data coming from a single source. Theheader data, including the length count, is passed throughand is captured by each FPGA when it recognizes the 0010\npreamble. Following the length-count data, each FPGA out-puts a High on DOUT until it has received its required num-\nber of data frames.\nAfter an FPGA has received its configuration data, it passes\non any additional frame start bits and configuration data onDOUT. When the total number of configuration clocksapplied after memory initializat ion equals the value of the\n24-bit length count, the FPGAs begin the start-up sequenceand become operational together. FPGA I/O are normallyreleased two CCLK cycles after the last configuration bit isreceived.\nThe daisy-chained bitstream is  not simply a concatenation\nof the individual bitstreams. The PROM File Formatter mustbe used to combine the bitstreams for a daisy-chained con-figuration.\nFigure 25:  Master/Slave Serial Mode Circuit DiagramSpartan\nMaster \nSeria lSpartan\nSlaveFPGA\nSlaveXilinx SPROM\nPROGRAMNote:\nM2, M1, M0 can be shortedto V\nCC if not used as I/O\nMODE\nDOUT\nCCLK CLKVCCVCC\n+5V\nDATA\nCE CEOVPP\nRESET/OE DONEDIN\nLDC\nINIT INIT DONEPROGRAM PROGRAM\nD/P INITRESETCCLKDIN\nCCLKDIN DOUT DOUTMODEM1M0\nM2\n(Low Reset Option Used)3.3K 3.3K 3.3K 3.3K \nDS060_25_061301N/C\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 29\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nExpress Mode (Spartan- XL Family Only)\nExpress mode is similar to Slave Serial mode, except that\ndata is processed one byte per CCLK cycle instead of onebit per CCLK cycle. An external source is used to driveCCLK, while byte-wide data is l oaded directly into the con-\nfiguration data shift registers ( Figure 27 ). A CCLK fre-\nquency of 1 MHz is equivalent to a 8 MHz serial rate,because eight bits of configuration data are loaded perCCLK cycle. Express mode does not support CRC errorchecking, but does support constant-field error checking. Alength count is not used in Express mode.\nExpress mode must be specified as an option to the devel-\nopment system. The Express mode bitstream is not com-patible with the other configuration modes (see Table 16,\npage 32 .) Express mode is selected by a <0X> on the Mode\npins (M1, M0).\nThe first byte of parallel config uration data must be available\nat the D inputs of the FPGA a short setup time before thesecond rising CCLK edge. Subsequent data bytes areclocked in on each consecutive rising CCLK edge(Figure 28 ). \nPseudo Daisy Chain\nMultiple devices with different configurations can be config-\nured in a pseudo daisy chain provided that all of the devicesare in Express mode. Concatenated bitstreams are used to\nconfigure the chain of Express mode devices so that eachdevice receives a separate header. CCLK pins are tiedtogether and D0-D7 pins are tied together for all devicesalong the chain. A status signal is passed from DOUT toCS1 of successive devices along  the chain. Frame data is\naccepted only when CS1 is High and the device’s configura-tion memory is not already full. The lead device in the chainhas its CS1 input tied High (or floating, since there is aninternal pull-up). The status pin DOUT is pulled Low afterthe header is received, and remains Low until the device’sconfiguration memory is full. DOUT is then pulled High to\nsignal the next device in the chain to accept the next headerand configuration data on the D0-D7 bus.\nThe DONE pins of all devices in the chain should be tied\ntogether, with one or more active internal pull-ups. If a largenumber of devices are included in the chain, deactivatesome of the internal pull-ups, since the Low-driving DONEpin of the last device in the chain must sink the current fromall pull-ups in the chain. The DONE pull-up is activated by\ndefault. It can be deactivated using a development systemoption.\nThe requirement that all DONE pins in a daisy chain be\nwired together applies only to Express mode, and only if alldevices in the chain are to become active simultaneously.All Spartan-XL devices in Express mode are synchronizedFigure 26:  Slave Serial Mode Programming Switching CharacteristicsTCCHBit n Bit n + 1\nBit n Bit n – 1TCCOTCCL TCCD TDCCDIN\nCCLK\nDOUT\n(Output)\nDS060_26_080400\nSymbol Description Min Max Units\nTDCC\nCCLKDIN setup 20 - ns\nTCCD DIN hold 0 - ns\nTCCO DIN to DOUT - 30 ns\nTCCH High time 40 - ns\nTCCL Low time 40 - ns\nFCC Frequency - 12.5 MHz\nNotes: \n1.

User I/Os for each device become active\nafter the DONE pin for that device goes High. (The exacttiming is determined by development system options.)Since the DONE pin is open-drain and does not drive a Highvalue, tying the DONE pins of all devices together preventsall devices in the chain from going High until the last devicein the chain has completed its configuration cycle. If the\nDONE pin of a device is left unconnected, the devicebecomes active as soon as that device has been config-ured. Only devices supporting Express mode can be usedto form an Express mode daisy chain.\nFigure 27:  Express Mode Circuit DiagramINIT\nCCLK CCLKSpartan-XLM0 M1\nCS1\nD0-D7 DATA BUS\nPROGRAM\nINIT\nCCLKPROGRAM\nINITDOUT\nDONE DONEDOUT\nTo Additional\nOptionalDaisy-ChainedDevicesTo Additional\nOptionalDaisy-ChainedDevices\nOptional\nDaisy-Chained\nSpartan-XLM0 M1\nVCCVCC\n3.3K CS1\nD0-D7\nPROGRAM\nDS060_27_08040088\n8\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 31\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nSetting CCLK Frequency\nIn Master mode, CCLK can be generated in either of two\nfrequencies. In the default slow mode, the frequency rangesfrom 0.5 MHz to 1.25 MHz for Spartan/XL devices. In fastCCLK mode, the frequency ranges from 4 MHz to 10 MHzfor Spartan/XL devices. The frequency is changed to fast byan option when running the bitstream generation software. \nData Stream Format \nThe data stream ("bitstream") format is identical for bothserial configuration modes, but different for the Spartan-XLfamily Express mode. In Express mode, the devicebecomes active when DONE goes High, therefore no lengthcount is required. Additionally , CRC error checking is not\nsupported in Express mode. The data stream format isshown in Table 16 . Bit-serial data is read from left to right.Express mode data is shown with D0 at the left and D7 at\nthe right.\nThe configuration data stream begins with a string of eight\nones, a preamble code, followed by a 24-bit length countand a separator field of ones (or 24 fill bits, in Spartan-XL\nfamily Express mode). This header is followed by the actualconfiguration data in frames. The length and number offrames depends on the device type (see Table 17 ).   Each\nframe begins with a start field and ends with an error check.In serial modes, a postamble code is required to signal theend of data for a single device. In all cases, additionalstart-up bytes of data are required to provide four clocks forthe startup sequence at the end of configuration. Long daisychains require additional startup bytes to shift the last datathrough the chain. All start-up bytes are "don’t cares".Figure 28:  Express Mode Programming Switching CharacteristicsDS060_28_080400BYTE\n0CCLK\nFPGA FilledINIT\nTDCTCDTIC\nD0-D7\nDOUTBYTE\n1BYTE\n6\nHeader Received\nSymbol Description Min Max Units\nTIC \nCCLKINIT (High) setup time 5 - μs\nTDC D0-D7 setup time 20 - ns\nTCD D0-D7 hold time 0 - ns\nTCCH CCLK High time 45 - ns\nTCCL CCLK Low time 45 - ns\nFCC CCLK Frequency - 10 MHz\nNotes: \n1.If not driven by the preceding DOUT, CS1 must  remain High until the \ndevice is fully configured.\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\n32 www.xilinx.com DS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nLegend:  A selection of CRC or non-CRC error checking is allowed by\nthe bitstream generation software. The Spartan-XL familyExpress mode only supports non-CRC error checking. Thenon-CRC error checking tests for a designatedend-of-frame field for each frame. For CRC error checking,the software calculates a running CRC and inserts a uniquefour-bit partial check at the end of each frame. The 11-bitCRC check of the last frame of an FPGA includes the lastseven data bits.\nDetection of an error results in the suspension of data load-\ning before DONE goes High, and the pulling down of theINIT\n pin. In Master serial mode, CCLK continues to operate\nexternally. The user must detect INIT  and initialize a new\nconfiguration by pulsing the PROGRAM  pin Low or cycling\nVCC.\nCyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for Configura-\ntion and Readback\nThe Cyclic Redundancy Check is a method of error detec-\ntion in data transmission applications. Generally, the trans-mitting system performs a calculation on the serialbitstream. The result of this calculation is tagged onto thedata stream as additional check bits. The receiving system\nperforms an identical calculation on the bitstream and com-pares the result with the received checksum.\nEach data frame of the configuration bitstream has four\nerror bits at the end, as shown in Table 16 . If a frame data\nerror is detected during the loading of the FPGA, the config-uration process with a potentially corrupted bitstream is ter-minated. The FPGA pulls the INIT\n pin Low and goes into a\nWait state.Table  16:  Spartan/XL Data Stream Formats \nData TypeSerial Modes \n(D0...)Express Mode\n(D0-D7)\n(Spartan-XL only)\nFill Byte 11111111b FFFFh\nPreamble Code 0010b 11110010b\nLength Count COUNT[23:0] COUNT[23:0](1)\nFill Bits 1111b -\nField Check \nCode- 11010010b\nStart Field 0b 11111110b(2)\nData Frame DATA[n–1:0] DATA[n–1:0]\nCRC or Constant \nField Checkxxxx (CRC)\nor 0110b11010010b\nExtend Write Cycle - FFD2FFFFFFh\nPostamble 01111111b -\nStart-Up Bytes(3)FFh FFFFFFFFFFFFFFh\nUnshaded Once per bitstream\nLight Once per data frame\nDark Once per device\nNotes: \n1.

This time delay is nomi-nally 16 ms. The delay is four times as long when in MasterSerial Mode to allow ample time for all slaves to reach a sta-ble V\nCC. When all INIT  pins are tied together, as recom-\nmended, the longest delay takes precedence. Therefore,devices with different time delays can easily be mixed andmatched in a daisy chain.\nThis delay is applied only on  power-up. It is not applied\nwhen reconfiguring an FPGA by pulsing the PROGRAM\n pinLow. During this time delay, or as long as the PROGRAM\ninput is asserted, the configurat ion logic is held in a Config-\nuration Memory Clear state. The configuration-memory\nframes are consecutively initialized, using the internal oscil-\nlator. \nAt the end of each complete pass through the frame\naddressing, the power-on time-out delay circuitry and thelevel of the PROGRAM\n pin are tested. If neither is asserted,\nthe logic initiates one additional clearing of the configurationframes and then tests the INIT\n input. \nInitialization \nDuring initialization and config uration, user pins HDC, LDC ,\nINIT and DONE provide status outputs for the system inter-\nface. The outputs LDC , INIT  and DONE are held Low and\nHDC is held High starting at the initial application of power. \nThe open drain INIT  pin is released after the final initializa-\ntion pass through the frame addresses. There is a deliber-ate delay before a Master-mode device recognizes aninactive INIT\n. Two internal clocks after the INIT  pin is recog-\nnized as High, the device samples the MODE pin to deter-mine the configuration mode. The appropriate interfacelines become active and the configuration preamble anddata can be loaded.Figure 29:  Circuit for Generating CRC-160X2\n23456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 13 14 1X15\nX16\n15\nSERIAL DATA IN\n10 1 51 41 31 21 11 0 9 8 7 65 1111\nCRC – CHECKSUM LAST DATA FRAME\nSTART BIT\nDS060_29_080400Polynomial: X16 + X15 + X2 + 1\nReadback Data Stream\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 35\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nConfiguration \nThe 0010 preamble code indicates that the following 24 bits\nrepresent the length count for serial modes. The lengthcount is the total number of configuration clocks needed toload the complete configuration data. (Four additional con-figuration clocks are required to complete the configurationprocess, as discussed below.) After the preamble and thelength count have been passed through to any device in thedaisy chain, its DOUT is held High to prevent frame startbits from reaching any daisy-chained devices. In Spar-tan-XL family Express mode, the length count bits areignored, and DOUT is held Low, to disable the next device inthe pseudo daisy chain.\nA specific configuration bit, early in the first frame of a mas-\nter device, controls the configuration-clock rate and canincrease it by a factor of eight. Therefore, if a fast configura-tion clock is selected by the bitstream, the slower clock rateis used until this configuration bit is detected.\nEach frame has a start field followed by the frame-configu-\nration data bits and a frame error field. If a frame data erroris detected, the FPGA halts loading, and signals the error bypulling the open-drain INIT\n pin Low. After all configuration\nframes have been loaded into an FPGA using a serialmode, DOUT again follows the input data so that theremaining data is passed on to the next device. InSpartan-XL family Express mode, when the first device isfully programmed, DOUT goes High to enable the nextdevice in the chain.\nDelaying Configuration After Power-Up \nThere are two methods of delaying configuration afterpower-up: put a logic Low on the PROGRAM\n input, or pull\nthe bidirectional INIT  pin Low, using an open-collector\n(open-drain) driver. (See Figure 30 .) \nA Low on the PROGRAM  input is the more radical\napproach, and is recommended when the power-supply risetime is excessive or poorly defined. As long as PROGRAM\nis Low, the FPGA keeps clearing its configuration memory.When PROGRAM\n goes High, the configuration memory is\ncleared one more time, followed by the beginning of config-uration, provided the INIT\n input is not externally held Low.\nNote that a Low on the PROGRAM  input automatically\nforces a Low on the INIT  output. The Spartan/XL FPGA\nPROGRAM  pin has a permanent weak pull-up.\nAvoid holding PROGRAM  Low for more than 500 μs. The\n500 μs maximum limit is only a recommendation, not a\nrequirement. The only effect of holding PROGRAM  Low for\nmore than 500 μs is an increase in current, measured at\nabout 40 mA in the XCS40XL. This increased current can-not damage the device. This applies only during reconfigu-ration, not during power-up. The INIT\n pin can also be held\nLow to delay reconfiguration, and the same characteristicsapply as for the PROGRAM\n pin.\nUsing an open-collector or open-drain driver to hold INIT\nLow before the beginning of configuration causes the FPGAFigure 30:  Power-up Configuration SequenceINIT\nHigh? if\nMaster\nSample\nMode Line\nLoad One\nConfiguration\nData Frame\nFrame\nError\nPass\nConfiguration\nData to DOUT VCC\nValid\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nYes\nOperationalStart-Up\nSequenceNo\nYes~1.3 μs per Frame\nMaster Delays Before \nSampling Mode Line\nMaster CCLK\nGoes Active\nFPull INIT Low\nand Stop\nDS060_30_080400EXTEST*\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD\nBYPASS\nCONFIGURE*\n(* if PROGRAM = High)\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD\nBYPASS\nEXTEST\nSAMPLE PRELOAD\nBYPASS\nUSER 1USER 2\nCONFIGURE\nREADBACKIf Boundary Scanis SelectedConfig-\nuration\nmemory\nFull\nCCLK\nCount Equals\nLength\nCountCompletely Clear\nConfiguration Memory\nOnce More\nLDC Output = L, HDC Output = HBoundary Scan\nInstructions\nAvailable:\nI/O ActiveKeep Clearing\nConfiguration\nMemoryTest MODE, Generate\nOne Time-Out Pulse\nof 16 or 64 msPROGRAM\n= LowNo\nYes\nYes\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\n36 www.xilinx.com DS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nto wait after completing the configuration memory clear\noperation. When INIT  is no longer held Low externally, the\ndevice determines its configuration mode by capturing thestate of the Mode pins, and is ready to start the configura-tion process. A master device waits up to an additional300 μs to make sure that any slaves in the optional daisy\nchain have seen that INIT\n is High.\nFor more details on Configurat ion, refer to the Xilinx Appli-\ncation Note "FPGA Configur ation Guidelines" (XAPP090).\nStart-Up\nStart-up is the transition from the configuration process to\nthe intended user operation. This transition involves achange from one clock source to another, and a changefrom interfacing parallel or serial configuration data wheremost outputs are 3-stated, to normal operation with I/O pinsactive in the user system. Start- up must make sure that the\nuser logic ‘wakes up’ gracefully, that the outputs becomeactive without causing contention with the configuration sig-nals, and that the internal flip-flops are released from theGlobal Set/Reset (GSR) at the right time.\nStart-Up Initiation\nTwo conditions have to be met in order for the start-up\nsequence to begin:\n\x81 The chip\'s internal memory must be full, and\n\x81 The configuration length count must be met, exactly.\nIn all configuration modes except Express mode, Spar-\ntan/XL devices read the expected length count from the bit-stream and store it in an internal register. The length countvaries according to the number of devices and the composi-tion of the daisy chain. Each device also counts the numberof CCLKs during configuration.\nIn Express mode, there is no length count. The start-up\nsequence for each device begins when the device has\nreceived its quota of configuration data. Wiring the DONE\npins of several devices together delays start-up of alldevices until all are fully configured.\nStart-Up Events\nThe device can be programmed to control three start-up\nevents.\n\x81 The release of the open-drain DONE output\n\x81 The termination of the Global Three-State and the \nchange of configuration-related pins to the user function, activating all IOBs.\n\x81 The termination of the Global  Set/Reset initialization of \nall CLB and IOB storage elements.Figure 31  describes start-up timing in detail. The three\nevents — DONE going High, the internal GSR beingde-activated, and the user I/O going active — can all occurin any arbitrary sequence. This relative timing is selected byoptions in the bitstream generation software. Heavy lines inFigure 31  show the default timing. The thin lines indicate all\nother possible timing options. The start-up logic must beclocked until the "F" (Finished) state is reached.\nThe default option, and the most practical one, is for DONE\nto go High first, disconnecting the configuration data sourceand avoiding any contention when the I/Os become activeone clock later. GSR is then released another clock periodlater to make sure that user operation starts from stableinternal conditions. This is the most common sequence,shown with heavy lines in Figure 31 , but the designer can\nmodify it to meet particular requirements.\nStart-Up Clock\nNormally, the start-up sequence is controlled by the internal\ndevice oscillator (CCLK), which is asynchronous to the sys-\ntem clock. As a configuration option, they can be triggeredby an on-chip user net called UCLK. This user net can beaccessed by placing the STARTUP library symbol, and thestart-up modes are known as UCLK_NOSYNC orUCLK_SYNC. This allows the device to wake up in synchro-nism with the user system.\nDONE Pin\nNote that DONE is an open-drain output and does not go\nHigh unless an internal pull-up is activated or an externalpull-up is attached. The internal pull-up is activated as thedefault by the bitstream generation software.\nThe DONE pin can also be wire-ANDed with DONE pins of\nother FPGAs or with other external signals, and can then beused as input to the start-up control logic. This is called“Start-up Timing Synchronous to Done In” and is selectedby either CCLK_SYNC or UCL K_SYNC. When DONE is not\nused as an input, the operation is called “Start-up TimingNot Synchronous to DONE In,” and is selected by eitherCCLK_NOSYNC or UCLK_NOSYNC. Express mode con-figuration always uses either CCLK_SYNC or UCLK_SYNCtiming, while the other configuration modes can use any ofthe four timing sequences. \nWhen the UCLK_SYNC option is enabled, the user can\nexternally hold the open-drain DONE output Low, and thusstall all further progress in the start-up sequence untilDONE is released and has gone High. This option can beused to force synchronization of several FPGAs to a com-mon user clock, or to guarantee that all devices are suc-cessfully configured before any I/Os go active.\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 37\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nConfiguration Through the Boundary Scan \nPins\nSpartan/XL devices can be configured through the bound-\nary scan pins. The basic procedure is as follows:\n\x81 Power up the FPGA with INIT  held Low (or drive the \nPROGRAM  pin Low for more than 300 ns followed by a \nHigh while holding INIT  Low). Holding INIT  Low allows \nenough time to issue the CONFIG command to the FPGA. The pin can be used as I/O after configuration if a resistor is used to hold INIT\n Low.\n\x81 Issue the CONFIG command to the TMS input.\x81 Wait for INIT  to go High.\n\x81 Sequence the boundary scan Test Access Port to the \nSHIFT-DR state.\n\x81 Toggle TCK to clock data into TDI pin.\nThe user must account for all TCK clock cycles after INIT\ngoes High, as all of these cycles affect the Length Count\ncompare.\nFor more detailed information, refer to the Xilinx application\nnote, " Boundary Scan in FPGA Devices ."

The first two data bits of the first frame are\nalways High. \nEach frame ends with four error check bits. They are read\nback as High. The last seven bits of the last frame are alsoread back as High. An additional Start bit (Low) and an11-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) signature follow,before RDBK.RIP returns Low. \nReadback Options\nReadback options are: Readback Capture, ReadbackAbort, and Clock Select. They are set with the bitstreamgeneration software.\nReadback Capture \nWhen the Readback Capture option is selected, the data\nstream includes sampled values of CLB and IOB signals.The rising edge of RDBK.TRIG latches the inverted valuesof the four CLB outputs, the IOB output flip-flops and theinput signals I1 and I2. Note that while the bits describing\nconfiguration (interconnect, function generators, and RAMcontent) are not inverted, the CLB and IOB output signals\nare inverted. RDBK.TRIG is located in the lower-left corner\nof the device.\nWhen the Readback Capture option is not selected, the val-\nues of the capture bits reflect the configuration data origi-nally written to those memory locations. If the RAMcapability of the CLBs is us ed, RAM data are available in\nReadback, since they directly overwrite the F and G func-tion-table configuration of the CLB. \nFigure 32:  Readback Example\nREADBACKDATA\nRIP TRIGCLK READ_DATA\nOBUFREAD_TRIGGER\nIBUF\nDS060_31_080400If Unconnected,\nDefault is CCLK\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 39\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nReadback Abort \nWhen the Readback Abort option is selected, a High-to-Low\ntransition on RDBK.TRIG terminates the Readback opera-tion and prepares the logic to accept another trigger. \nAfter an aborted Readback, additional clocks (up to one\nReadback clock per configuration frame) may be required tore-initialize the control logic. The status of Readback is indi-cated by the output control net RDBK.RIP . RDBK.RIP isHigh whenever a readback is in progress.\nClock Select \nCCLK is the default clock. However, the user can insert\nanother clock on RDBK.CLK. Readback control and dataare clocked on rising edges of RDBK.CLK. If Readbackmust be inhibited for security reasons, the Readback controlnets are simply not connected . RDBK.CLK is located in the\nlower right chip corner.\nViolating the Maximum High and Low Time \nSpecification for the Readback Clock\nThe Readback clock has a maximum High and Low time\nspecification. In some cases,  this specification cannot bemet. For example, if a processor is controlling Readback, an\ninterrupt may force it to stop in the middle of a readback.This necessitates stopping the clock, and thus violating thespecification.\nThe specification is mandatory only on clocking data at the\nend of a frame prior to the next start bit. The transfer mech-anism will load the data to a shift register during the last sixclock cycles of the frame, prior to the start bit of the followingframe. This loading process is dynamic, and is the source ofthe maximum High and Low time requirements.\nTherefore, the specification only applies to the six clock\ncycles prior to and including any start bit, including theclocks before the first start bit in the Readback data stream.At other times, the frame data is already in the register andthe register is not dynamic. Thus, it can be shifted out justlike a regular shift register. \nThe user must precisely calculate the location of the Read-\nback data relative to the frame. The system must keep trackof the position within a data frame, and disable interruptsbefore frame boundaries.

After configuration, if an IOB isunused it is configured as an input with the I/O pull-up resis-tor network remaining activated.Any user I/O can be configured to drive the Global\nSet/Reset net GSR or the global three-state net GTS. SeeGlobal Signals: GSR and GTS , page 20  for more informa-\ntion.\nDevice pins for Spartan/XL devices are described in\nTable 18 .\nSome Spartan-XL devices are available in Pb-free package\noptions. The Pb-free package options have the same pin-outs as the standard package options.\nTable  18:  Pin Descriptions\nPin NameI/O \nDuring \nConfig.I/O After \nConfig. Pin Description\nPermanently Dedicated Pins\nVCC X X Eight or more (depending on package) connections to the nominal +5V supply \nvoltage (+3.3V for Spartan-XL devices). All must be connected, and each must be decoupled with a 0.01 –0.1 μF capacitor to Ground.\nGND X X Eight or more (depending on package type) connections to Ground. All must be \nconnected.\nCCLK I or O I During configuration,  Configuration Clock (CCLK) is an output in Master mode and \nis an input in Slave mode. After configuration, CCLK has a weak pull-up resistor and can be selected as the Readback Clock. There is no CCLK High or Low time restriction on Spartan/XL devices, except during Readback. See Violating the \nMaximum High and Low Time Specification for the Readback Clock , page 39  \nfor an explanation of this exception.\nDONE I/O O DONE is a bidirectional signal with an optional internal pull-up resistor. As an \nopen-drain output, it indicates the completion of the configuration process. As an input, a Low level on DONE can be configur ed to delay the global logic initialization \nand the enabling of outputs.\nThe optional pull-up resistor is selected as an option in the program that creates \nthe configuration bitstream. The resistor is included by default.   \nPROGRAM\nII P R O G R A M  is an active Low input that forces the FPGA to clear its configuration \nmemory. It is used to initiate a configuration cycle. When PROGRAM  goes High, \nthe FPGA finishes the current clear cycle and executes another complete clear cycle, before it goes into a WAIT state and releases INIT\n. \nThe PROGRAM  pin has a permanent weak pull-up, so it need not be externally \npulled up to VCC.\nMODE \n(Spartan)\nM0, M1 \n(Spartan-XL)I X The Mode input(s) are sampled after INIT  goes High to determine the \nconfiguration mode to be used. \nDuring configuration, these pins have a we ak pull-up resistor. For the most popular \nconfiguration mode, Slave Serial, the mode pins can be left unconnected. For Master Serial mode, connect the Mode/M0 pin directly to system ground.\nSpartan and Spartan-XL FPGA Families Data Sheet\nDS060 (v2.0) March 1, 2013 www.xilinx.com 63\nProduct SpecificationRProduct Obsolete/Under Obsolescence\nPWRDWN II P W R D W N  is an active Low input that forces the FPGA into the Power Down state \nand reduces power consumption. When PWRDWN  is Low, the FPGA disables all \nI/O and initializes all flip-f lops. All inputs are interpreted as Low independent of \ntheir actual level. VCC must be main tained, and the configuration data is \nmaintained. PWRDWN  halts configuration if asserted before or during \nconfiguration, and re-starts configuration when removed. When PWRDWN  returns \nHigh, the FPGA becomes operational by first enabling the inputs and flip-flops and then enabling the outputs. PWRDWN\n has a default internal pull-up resistor. \nUser I/O Pins That Can Have Special Functions\nTDO O O If boundary scan is used, this pin is the Test Data Output. If boundary scan is not \nused, this pin is a 3-state output without a register, after configuration is completed. \nTo use this pin, place the library compone nt TDO instead of the usual pad symbol. \nAn output buffer must still be used.\nTDI, TCK, \nTMSII / O\nor I \n(JTAG)If boundary scan is used, these pins are Test Data In, Test Clock, and Test Mode \nSelect inputs respectively. They come directly from the pads, bypassing the IOBs. These pins can also be used as inputs to the CLB logic after configuration is completed. \nIf the BSCAN symbol is not placed in the design, all boundary scan functions are \ninhibited once configuration is completed, and these pins become user-programmable I/O. In this case, they must be called out by special library elements. To use these pins, place the library components TDI, TCK, and TMS instead of the usual pad symbols. Inpu t or output buffers must still be used. \nHDC O I/O High During Configuration (HDC) is dr iven High until the I/O go active. It is \navailable as a control output indicating that configuration is not yet completed. After configuration, HDC is a user-programmable I/O pin. \nLDC\nO I/O Low During Configuration (LDC ) is driven Low until the I/O go active. It is available \nas a control output indicating that configuration is not yet completed. After configuration, LDC\n is a user-programmable I/O pin. \nINIT I/O I/O Before and during configuration, INIT  is a bidirectional signal. A 1 k Ω to 10 k Ω \nexternal pull-up resistor is recommended. \nAs an active Low open-drain output, INIT  is held Low during the power stabilization \nand internal clearing of the configuration memory.   As an active Low input, it can be used to hold the FPGA in the internal WAIT state before the start of configuration.   Master mode devices stay in a WAIT state an additional 30 to 300 μs after INIT\n has gone High. \nDuring configuration, a Low on this output indicates that a configuration data error \nhas occurred. After the I/O go active, INIT  is a user-programmable I/O pin. \nPGCK1 - \nPGCK4 \n(Spartan)Weak \nPull-upI or I/O Four Primary Global inputs each drive a dedicated internal global net with short \ndelay and minimal skew.

These internal global nets c an also be driven from internal logic. If \nnot used to drive a global net, any of these pins is a user-programmable I/O pin. \nThe GCK1-GCK8 pins provide the shortest path to the eight Global Low-Skew \nBuffers. Any input pad symbol connected directly to the input of a BUFGLS symbol is automatically placed on one of these pins.\nCS1 \n(Spartan-XL)I I/O During Express configuration, CS1 is used as a serial-enable signal for \ndaisy-chaining.\nD0-D7 \n(Spartan-XL)I I/O During Express configuration, these eight input pins receive configuration data. \nAfter configuration, they are user-programmable I/O pins.\nDIN I I/O During Slave Serial or Master Serial configuration, DIN is the serial configuration \ndata input receiving data on the rising edge of CCLK. After configuration, DIN is a user-programmable I/O pin. \nDOUT O I/O During Slave Serial or Master Serial configuration, DOUT is the serial \nconfiguration data output that can drive the DIN of daisy-chained slave FPGAs. DOUT data changes on the falling edge of CCLK, one- and-a-half CCLK periods \nafter it was received at the DIN input.   \nIn Spartan-XL family Express mode, DOUT is the status output that can drive the \nCS1 of daisy-chained FPGAs, to enable and disable downstream devices.\nAfter configuration, DOUT is a user-programmable I/O pin. \nUnrestricted User-Programmable I/O Pins\nI/O Weak \nPull-upI/O These pins can be configured to be input and/or output after configuration is \ncompleted. Before configuration is completed, these pins have an internal high-value pull-up resistor network that defines the logic level as High.
