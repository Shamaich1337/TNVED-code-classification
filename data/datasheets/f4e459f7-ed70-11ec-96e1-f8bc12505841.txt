As shown, communications to and from the DS1337 \noccur serially over an I2C bus. The DS1337 operates as a slave device on the serial bus. Access i s obtained by \nimplementing a START condition and providing a device identification code, followed by data. Subsequent \nregisters can be accessed sequentially until a STOP condition is executed. The device is fully accessible through \nthe I2C interface whenev er V CC is between 5.5V and 1.8V. I2C operation is not guaranteed when V CC is below 1.8V. \nThe DS1337 maintains the time and date when V CC is as low as 1.3V.  \n \nOSCILLATOR CIRCUIT  \nThe DS1337 uses an external 32.768kHz crystal. The oscillator circuit does not r equire any external resistors or \ncapacitors to operate. Table 1 specifies several crystal parameters for the external crystal. The Block Diagram  \nshows a functional schematic of the oscillator circuit. The st artup time is usually less than 1 second when using a \ncrystal with the specified characteristics.  \n \nTable 1.

Crystal \nfrequency drift caused by temperatur e shifts creates additional error. External circuit noise coupled into the \noscillator circuit can result in the clock running fast. Figure 1 shows a typical PC board layout for isolating the \ncrystal and osc illator from noise.

Refer to Application Note 58 for information about crystal accuracy vs. temperature.  \n \nOPERATING MODES  \nThe amount of current consumed by the DS1337 is determined, in part, by the I2C interface and oscillator \noperation.  The following table shows the relationship between the operating mode and the corresponding I CC \nparameter.  \n \nOperating Mode  VCC Power  \nI2C Interface Active  1.8V ≤ V CC ≤ 5.5V  ICC Active (I CCA) \nI2C Interface Inactive  1.8V ≤ V CC ≤ 5.5V  ICC Standby (I CCS) \nI2C Interface Inactive  1.3V ≤ V CC ≤ 1.8V  Timekeeping (I CCTOSC ) \nI2C Interface Inactive  \nOscillator Disabled  1.3V ≤ V CC ≤ 1.8V  Data Retention \n(ICCTDDR ) \n LOCAL GROUND PLANE (LAYER 2)  \nCRYSTAL  X1 \nX2 \nGND \nNOTE: AVOID RO UTING SIGNALS IN THE CROSSHATCHED \nAREA (UPPER LEFT -HAND QUADRANT) OF THE PACKAGE \nUNLESS THERE IS A GROUND PLANE BETWEEN THE SIGNAL \nLINE AND THE PACKAGE.  \n \n7 of 16 \nDS1337 I2C Serial Real -Time Clock  \n \nADDRES S MAP  \nTable 2 shows the address map for the DS1337 registers. During a multibyte access, when the address pointer \nreaches the end of the register space (0Fh) it wraps around to location 00h. On an I2C START,  STOP, or address \npointer incrementing to location 00h, the current time is transferred to a second set of registers. The time \ninformation is read from these secondary registers, while the clock may continue to run. This eliminates the need \nto re- read the registers in case of an update of the main registers during a read.  \n \nTable 2.

If a microcont roller connected to the DS1337 resets \nwhile reading from the DS1337 during an I2C read, the two could become unsynchronized.  The microcontroller must \nterminate the last byte read with a Not -Acknowledge (NACK) to properly terminate the read.  When the micr ocontroller \nresets, the DS1337 I2C interface may be placed into a known state by toggling SCL until SDA is observed to be at a \nhigh level. At that point the microcontroller should pull SDA low while SCL is high, generating a START condition.  \n \n \n8 of 16 \nDS1337 I2C Serial Real -Time Clock  \n \nCLOCK AND CAL ENDAR  \nThe time and calendar information is obtained by reading the appropriate register bytes. The RTC registers are \nillustrated in Table 2. The time and calendar are set or initialized by writing the appropriate register bytes. The \ncontents of the time and calendar registers are in the binary -coded decimal (BCD) format.  \n The day -of-week register increments at midnight. Values that correspond to the day of week are user -defined but \nmust be sequential (i.e., if 1 equals Sunday, then 2 equals Monday, and so on.). Illogical time and date entries result in undefined operation.  \n \nWhen reading or writing the time and date registers, secondary (user) buffers are used to prevent errors when the \ninternal registers update. When reading the time and date registers, the user buffers are synchronized to the internal registers on any start or stop and when the register pointer rolls over to zero.  \n The countdown chain is reset whenever the seconds register is written. Write t ransfers occur on the acknowledge \npulse from the device. To avoid rollover issues, once the countdown chain is reset, the remaining time and date \nregisters must be written within 1 second. The 1Hz square- wave output, if enable, transitions high 500ms after  the \nseconds data transfer, provided the oscillator is already running.  \n \nThe DS1337 can be run in either 12- hour or 24- hour mode. Bit 6 of the hours register is defined as the 12-  or  \n24-hour mode- select bit. When high, the 12- hour mode is selected. In the 12-hour mode, bit 5 is the AM/PM bit \nwith logic high being PM. In the 24- hour mode, bit 5 is the second 10- hour bit (20– 23 hours). All hours values, \nincluding the alarms, must be reinitialized whenever the 12/ 24-hour mode bit is changed. The century bit ( bit 7 of \nthe month register) is toggled when the years register overflows from 99– 00. \n \nALARMS  \nThe DS1337 contains two time- of-day/date alarms. Alarm 1 can be set by writing to registers 07h –0Ah. Alarm 2 \ncan be set by writing to registers 0Bh –0Dh. The alarm s can be programmed (by the INTCN bit of the control \nregister) to operate in two different modes —each alarm can drive its own separate interrupt output or both alarms \ncan drive a common interrupt output. Bit 7 of each of the time- of-day/date alarm register s are mask bits ( Table 2). \nWhen all of the mask bits for each alarm are logic 0, an alarm only occurs when the values in the timekeeping \nregisters 00h –06h match the values stored in the time- of-day/date alar m registers. The alarms can also be \nprogrammed to repeat every second, minute, hour, day, or date. Table 3 shows the possible settings. \nConfigurations not listed in the table result in illogical operation.  \n \nThe DY/ DT bits (bit 6 of the alarm day/date registers) control whether the alarm value stored in bits 0– 5 of that \nregister reflects the day of the week or the date of the month. If DY/ DT is written to logic 0, the alarm is the result of \na match with date of the month. If DY/ DT is written to logic 1, the alarm is the result of a match with day of the \nweek.  \n \nWhen the RTC register values match alarm register settings, the corresponding alarm flag (A1F or A2F) bit is set \nto logic 1. The bit(s) will remain at a logic 1 until written to a logic 0 by the user.  If the corresponding alarm \ninterrupt enable (A1IE or A2IE) is also set to logic 1, the alarm condition activates one of the interrupt output ( INTA \nor SQW/ INTB ) signals. The match is tested on the once- per-second update of the time and date registers.  \n \n9 of 16 \nDS1337 I2C Serial Real -Time Clock  \n \nTable 3.

This bit is enabled (logic 0) when power is first applied.  \n \nBits 4 and 3: Rate Select (RS2 and RS1).  These bits control the frequency of the square- wave output when the \nsquare wave has been enabled. The table below shows the square- wave frequencies that can be selected with the \nRS bits. These bits are both set to logic 1 (32kHz) when power is first applied.  \n \nSQW/ INTB  Output  \nINTCN RS2 RS1 SQW/ INTB  \nOUTPUT  A2IE  \n0 0 0 1Hz X \n0 0 1 4.096kHz  X \n0 1 0 8.192kHz  X \n0 1 1 32.768kHz  X \n1 X X A2F 1 \n \nBit 2: Interrupt Control (INTCN). This bit controls the relationship between the two alarms and the interrupt output \npins. When the INTCN bit is set to logic 1, a match between the timekeeping registers and the alarm 1 registers l \nactivates the INTA  pin (provided that the alarm is enabled) and a match between the timekeeping registers and the \nalarm 2 registers acti vates the SQW/ INTB  pin (provided that the alarm is enabled). When the INTCN bit is set to \nlogic 0, a square wave is output on the SQW/ INTB  pin.

When set to l ogic 1, this bit permits the alarm 2 flag (A2F) bit in the status \nregister to assert INTA  (when INTCN = 0) or to assert SQW/ INTB  (when INTCN = 1). When the A2IE bit is set to \nlogic 0, the A2F bit does not initiate an interrupt signal. The A2IE bit is disab led (logic 0) when power is first \napplied.  \n \nBit 0: Alarm 1 Interrupt Enable (A1IE).  When set to logic 1, this bit permits the alarm 1 flag (A1F) bit in the status \nregister to assert INTA . When the A1IE bit is set to logic 0, the A1F bit does not initiate t he INTA  signal. The A1IE \nbit is disabled (logic 0) when power is first applied.  \n \nStatus Register (0Fh)  \nBit 7  Bit 6  Bit 5  Bit 4  Bit 3  Bit 2  Bit 1  Bit 0  \nOSF 0 0 0 0 0 A2F A1F \n \nBit 7: Oscillator Stop Flag (OSF).  A logic 1 in this bit indicates that the osci llator either is stopped or was stopped \nfor some period of time and may be used to judge the validity of the clock and calendar data. This bit is set to logic \n1 anytime that the oscillator stops. The following are examples of conditions that can cause the OSF bit to be set:  \n \n1) The first time power is applied.  \n2) The voltage present on V CC is insufficient to support oscillation.  \n3) The EOSC  bit is turned off.  \n4) External influences on the crystal (e.g., noise, leakage, etc.).  \n \nThis bit remains at logic 1 until written to logic 0.  \n \nBit 1: Alarm 2 Flag (A2F).  A logic 1 in the alarm 2 flag bit indicates that the time matched the alarm 2 registers. \nThis flag can be used to generate an interrupt on either  INTA  or SQW /INTB  depending on the status of the INTCN \nbit in the contr ol register. If the INTCN bit is set to logic 0 and A2F is at logic 1 (and A2IE bit is also logic 1), the  \nINTA  pin goes low. If the INTCN bit is set to logic 1 and A2F is logic 1 (and A2IE bit is also logic 1), the SQW/ INTB  \npin goes low. A2F is cleared whe n written to logic 0. This bit can only be written to logic 0. Attempting to write to \nlogic 1 leaves the value unchanged.  \n \nBit 0: Alarm 1 Flag (A1F).  A logic 1 in the alarm 1 flag bit indicates that the time matched the alarm 1 registers. If \nthe A1IE bit i s also logic 1, the INTA  pin goes low. A1F is cleared when written to logic 0. This bit can only be \nwritten to logic 0. Attempting to write to logic 1 leaves the value unchanged.  \n \n11 of 16 \nDS1337 I2C Serial Real -Time Clock  \n \nI2C SERIAL DATA BUS  \nThe DS1337 supports the I2C bus protocol. A device that s ends data onto the bus is defined as a transmitter and a \ndevice receiving data as a receiver. The device that controls the message is called a master. The devices that are \ncontrolled by the master are referred to as slaves. A master device that generates t he serial clock (SCL), controls \nthe bus access, and generates the START and STOP conditions must control the bus. The DS1337 operates as a \nslave on the I2C bus. Within the bus specifications a standard mode (100kHz maximum clock rate) and a fast mode \n(400k Hz maximum clock rate) are defined. The DS1337 works in both modes. Connections to the bus are made \nthrough the open- drain I/O lines SDA and SCL.  \n \nThe following bus protocol has been defined ( Figure 2): \n \n• Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.  \n• During data transfer, the data line must remain stable whenever the clock line is HIGH. Changes in the data line while the clock line is HIGH are interpreted as control signals.\n \n \nAccordingly, the following bus conditions have been defined:  \n \nBus not busy: Both data and clock lines remain HIGH.  \n Start data transfer: A change in the state of the data line, from HIGH to LOW, while the clock is HIGH, defines a \nSTART condition.  \n \nStop data transfer: A cha nge in the state of the data line, from LOW to HIGH, while the clock line is HIGH, \ndefines the STOP condition.  \n \nData valid: The state of the data line represents valid data when, after a START condition, the data line is stable \nfor the duration of the HIGH  period of the clock signal. The data on the line must be changed during the LOW \nperiod of the clock signal. There is one clock pulse per bit of data.  \n \nEach data transfer is initiated with a START condition and terminated with a STOP condition. The number of data \nbytes transferred between START and STOP conditions are not limited, and are determined by the master device. The information is transferred byte- wise and each receiver acknowledges with a ninth bit.  \n \nAcknowledge: Each receiving device, when addressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge after the reception \nof each byte. The master device must generate an extra clock pulse that is associated with this acknowledge bit.  \n \nA device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse in such a way that \nthe SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge- related clock pulse. Of course, setup and \nhold times must be taken into account. A master must signal an end of data to the slave by not generating an \nacknowledge bit on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this case, the slave must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate the STOP condition.  \n \n12 of 16 \nDS1337 I2C Serial Real -Time Clock  \n \nFigure 2. Data Transfer on I2C Serial Bus  \n \n \nDepending upon the state of the R/ W bit, two types of data transfer are possible:  \n \n1) Data transfer from a master transmitter to a slave receiver. The first byte transmitted by the master is the \nslave address. Next follows a number of data bytes. The slave returns an acknowledge bit after each received \nbyte. Data is transferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first.  \n \n2) Data transfer from a slave transmitter to a master receiver. The master transmits the first byte (the slave \naddress). The slave then returns an acknow ledge bit, followed by the slave transmitting a number of data \nbytes. The master returns an acknowledge bit after all received bytes other than the last byte. At the end of the \nlast received byte, a “not acknowledge” is returned. The master device generate s all of the serial clock pulses \nand the START and STOP conditions. A transfer is ended with a STOP condition or with a repeated START \ncondition. Since a repeated START condition is also the beginning of the next serial transfer, the bus is not \nreleased. D ata is transferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first.  \n The DS1337 can operate in the following two modes:  \n \n1) Slave Receiver Mode (Write Mode): Serial data and clock are received through SDA and SCL. After each \nbyte is received an acknowledge bit is t ransmitted. START and STOP conditions are recognized as the \nbeginning and end of a serial transfer. Address recognition is performed by hardware after reception of the slave address and direction bit ( Figure 3\n). The slave address byte is the first byte received after the master \ngenerates the START condition. The slave address byte contains the 7- bit DS1337 address, which is 1101000, \nfollowed by the direction bit (R/ W), which, for a write, is 0. After receivi ng and decoding the slave address byte \nthe device outputs an acknowledge on the SDA line. After the DS1337 acknowledges the slave address + \nwrite bit, the master transmits a register address to the DS1337. This sets the register pointer on the DS1337. \nThe master may then transmit zero or more bytes of data, with the DS1337 acknowledging each byte received. \nThe address pointer will increment after each data byte is transferred. The master generates a STOP condition \nto terminate the data write.  \n \n2) Slave Transmi tter Mode (Read Mode): The first byte is received and handled as in the slave receiver mode. \nHowever, in this mode, the direction bit indicates that the transfer direction is reversed. Serial data is \ntransmitted on SDA by the DS1337 while the serial clock is input on SCL. START and STOP conditions are \nrecognized as the beginning and end of a serial transfer (Figure 4 and Figure 5). The slave address byte is t he \nfirst byte received after the master generates a START condition. The slave address byte contains the 7- bit \nDS1337 address, which is 1101000, followed by the direction bit (R/ W), which, for a read, is 1. After receiving \nand decoding the slave address by te the device outputs an acknowledge on the SDA line. The DS1337 then \nbegins to transmit data starting with the register address pointed to by the register pointer. If the register \npointer is not written to before the initiation of a read mode the first address that is read is the last one stored in \nthe register pointer. The DS1337 must receive a “not acknowledge” to end a read.  \n \n13 of 16 \nDS1337 I2C Serial Real -Time Clock  \n \nFigure 3. Data Write —Slave Receiver Mode \n \n        \nFigure 4.
