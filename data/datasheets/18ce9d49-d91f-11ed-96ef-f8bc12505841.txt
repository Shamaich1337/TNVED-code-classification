They \nare designed for balanced data transmission and comply with \nEIA Standards RS -485 and RS -422. The ADM4850 /ADM4851 / \nADM4852/ ADM4853 are half-duplex transceivers that share \ndifferential lines and have separate enable inputs for the driver \nand receiver. The full duplex ADM4854/ ADM4855/ ADM4856 / \nADM4857 transceivers have dedicated differential line driver \noutputs and receiver inputs.  \nThe devices have a 1/8 -unit load receiver input impedance, \nwhich allows up to 256 transceivers on one bus. Because only one  \ndriver must be enabled at any time, the output of a disabled or powered down driver is three -stated to avoid overloading the bus.  \nThe receiver inputs have a true fail -safe feature, which ensures a \nlogic high output level when the inputs are open or shorted.  FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAG RAMS  \n \nFigure 1. ADM4850/ ADM4851/ ADM4852 /ADM4853 Functional Block Diagram  \n \nFigure 2. ADM4854/ ADM4855/ ADM4856 /ADM4857 Functional Block Diagram   \nThis guarantees that the rece iver outputs are in a known state \nbefore  communication begins and when communication ends. \nThe driver outputs are slew rate limited to reduce EMI and data \nerrors caused by reflections from improperly terminated buses. \nExcessive power dissipation caused by bus contention or by \noutput shorting is prevented with a thermal shutdown circuit.  \nThe devices are fully specified over the commercial and industrial \ntemperature ranges and are available in 8 -lead SOIC  (ADM4850 \nthrough ADM4857) , 8-lead LFCSP  (ADM4850 /ADM4852/ \nADM4853) , and  8-lead MSOP ( ADM4850 only) packages.  \nTable 1.

F | Page 13 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM4850/ ADM4851/ ADM4852/ ADM4853/ ADM4854 / \nADM4855/ ADM4856/ ADM4857  are high speed RS -485/RS-422 \ntransceivers offering enhanced performance over industry -\nstandard devices. All devices in the family contain one driver \nand one receiver but offer a choice of performance options. The devices feature true fail -safe operation, which guarantees  a logic \nhigh re ceiver output when the receiver inputs are open  circuit \nor short -circuit, or when they are connected to a terminated \ntransmission line with all drivers disabled (see the Fail -Safe \nOperation  section).  \nSLEW RATE  CONTROL \nThe ADM4850 and ADM4854 feature a controlled slew rate  \ndriver that minimizes EMI  and reduces reflections caused by \nincorrectly terminated cables, allowing error  free data transmission \nrates up to 115 kbps. The ADM4851  and ADM4855 offer a higher \nlimit on driver output slew rate, allowing data transmission rates up to 500 kbps. The driver slew rates of the ADM4852/ ADM4856 and the ADM4853/ ADM4857 are not limited, \noffering data transmission rates up to 2.5 Mbps and 10 Mbps, \nrespectively.  RECEIVER INPUT FILTE RING  \nThe receivers of all the devices incorporate input hysteresis. In \naddition, the re ceivers of the 115 kbps ADM4850 and ADM4854 \nand the 500 kbps ADM4851 and ADM4855 incorporate input \nfiltering , which enhances noise immunity with differential \nsignals that have very slow rise and fall times. However, it causes the propagation delay to increase by 20% . \nHALF -DUPLEX/FULL D UPLEX OPERATI ON \nHalf-duplex operation implies that the transceiver can transmit and \nreceive, but it can do only one of these at any given time. How ever, \nwith full duplex  operation, the transceiver can transmit and \nreceive simultaneously. The ADM4850/ADM4851/ ADM4852 / \nADM4853 are half -duplex d evices in which the driver and the \nreceiver share differential bus terminals. The ADM4854/ ADM4855/ ADM4856/ ADM4857 are full duplex  devices that \nhave dedicated driver output and receiver input pins.

F | Page 14 of 16 HIGH RECEIVER INPUT IMPEDANCE  \nThe input im pedance of the ADM4850/ ADM4851/ ADM4852 / \nADM4853/ ADM4854/ ADM4855 /ADM4856 /ADM4857  receivers  \nis 96 kΩ , which is eight times higher than the standard RS -485 unit  \nload of 12 k Ω. This 96 kΩ impedance enables a standard driver \nto drive 32 unit loads or to be connected to 256 ADM4850/ \nADM4851/ ADM4852/ ADM4853/ ADM4854/ ADM4855/ \nADM4856/ ADM4857 receivers. An RS -485 bus, driven by a \nsingle standard driver, can be conn ected to a combination of \nADM4850/ ADM4851/ ADM4852/ ADM4853/ ADM4854 / \nADM4855/ ADM4856/ ADM4857  devices and standard unit \nload receivers, up to an equivalent of 32 standard unit loads.  \nTHREE -STATE BUS CONNECTION  \nThe half -duplex devices  (ADM4850/ ADM4852/ ADM4853) \nhave a driver enable pin  (DE) that enables the driver outputs \nwhen taken high, or puts the driver outputs into a high \nimpedance state when taken low. S imilarly, the half -duplex devices  \nhave an active low receiver enable pin  (RE). Taking this pin low \nenables the receiver, whereas taking it high puts the receiver \noutputs into a high impedance state , which allows several driver \noutputs to be connected to an RS -485 bus. Note that only one \ndriver must  be enabled at a time, but that m any receivers can be \nenabled.   \nSHUTDOWN MODE  \nThe ADM4850/ ADM4852/ ADM4853 have a low power \nshutdown mode, which is enabled by ta king RE high and DE \nlow. If shutdown mode is not used, the fact that DE is active \nhigh and RE is active low offers a convenient way of switching the \ndevice between transmit and receive by tying DE and RE together.  \nIf DE is driven low and RE is driven high for less than 50 ns, the \ndevices are guaranteed not to enter shutdown mode. If DE is driven low and \nRE is driven high for at least 3000 ns, the devices \nare guaranteed  to enter shutdown mode.  FAIL -SAFE OPERATION  \nThe ADM4850/ ADM4851 /ADM4852/ ADM4853/ ADM4854 / \nADM4855/ ADM4856/ ADM4857 offer true fail -safe operation \nwhile remaining fully compliant with the ±200 mV EIA/TIA -485 \nstandard. A logic high receiver output gen erate s when the \nreceiver inputs are shorted together or open circuit, or when \nthey are connected to a terminated transmission line with all drivers disabled. This logic high is done by setting the receiver \nthreshold between −30 mV and −200 mV . If the diffe rential \nreceiver input voltage (A − B) is greater than or equal to −30 mV , RO is logic high. If (A − B) is less than or equal to \n−200 mV , RO  is logic low. In the case of a terminated bus \nwith  all transmitters disabled, the differential input voltage \nof the receiver is pulled to 0 V by the internal circuitry of \nthe ADM4850/ ADM4851/ ADM4852/ ADM4853/ ADM4854/ \nADM4855/ ADM4856/ ADM4857, which results in a logic high \nwith 30 mV minimum noise margin.  \nCURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL SHUTDOWN  \nThe ADM4850/ ADM4851/ ADM4852/ ADM4853/ ADM4854 / \nADM4855/ ADM4856/ ADM4857 incorporate two protection \nmechanisms to guard the drivers against short circuits, bus contention, or other fault conditions. The first is a current limiting  \noutput stage, which protects the driver against short circuits over the entire common -mode voltage range by limiting the \noutput current to approximately 70 mA . Under extreme fault \nconditions where the current limit is not effective, a thermal shutdown circuit puts the  driver outp uts into a high imped ance \nstate if the die temperature exceeds 150° C, and does not turn \nthem back on until the temperature falls to 130 °C.  \nData Sheet  ADM4850 to ADM4857 \nRev.
