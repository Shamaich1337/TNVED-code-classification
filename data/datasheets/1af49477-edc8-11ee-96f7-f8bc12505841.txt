They contain a band\ngap temperature sensor and a 10-bit ADC to monitor and digitize\nthe temperature reading to a resolution of 0.25°C.\nThe AD7414/AD7415  provide a 2-wire serial interface that is com-\npatible with SMBus and I2C interfaces. The parts come in three ver-\nsions: the AD7414/AD7415 -0, AD7414/AD7415 -1, and AD7414 -3.\nThe AD7414/AD7415 -0 and AD7414/AD7415 -1 versions provide a\nchoice of three different SMBus addresses for each version. All four\nAD7414  versions give the possibility of eight different I2C addresses\nwhile the two AD7415  versions allow up to six I2C addresses to be\nused.\nThe AD7414/AD7415 ’s 2.7 V supply voltage, low supply current,\nserial interface, and small package size make them ideal for a vari-\nety of applications, including personal computers, office equipment,\ncellular phones, and domestic appliances.\nIn the AD7414 , on-chip registers can be programmed with high\nand low temperature limits, and an open-drain overtemperature\nindicator output (ALERT) becomes active when a programmed limitis exceeded. A configuration register allows programming of the\nstate of the ALERT output (active high or active low). This output\ncan be used as an interrupt or as an SMBus alert.\nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1.On-chip temperature sensor. The sensor allows an accurate\nmeasurement of the ambient temperature to be made. It is\ncapable of ±0.5°C temperature accuracy.\n2.SMBus/I2C-compatible serial interface.

H | 7 of 17CIRCUIT INFORMATION\nThe AD7414/AD7415  are standalone digital temperature sensors.\nThe on-chip temperature sensor allows an accurate measurement\nof the ambient device temperature to be made. The 10-bit analog-\nto-digital converter converts the temperature measured into a twos\ncomplement format for storage in the temperature register. The\nADC is made up of a conventional successive-approximation con-\nverter based around a capacitor digital-to-analog (DAC). The serial\ninterface is I2C-and SMBus- compatible. The AD7414/AD7415  re-\nquire a 2.7 V to 5.5 V power supply. The temperature sensor has a\nworking measurement range of −40°C to +125°C.\nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\nTemperature measurement is initiated by two methods. The first\nuses an internal clock countdown of 800 ms, and a conversion is\nperformed. The internal oscillator is the only circuit that is powered\nup between conversions, and once it times out, every 800 ms,\na wake-up signal is sent to power up the rest of the circuitry. A\nmonostable is activated at the beginning of the wake-up signal to\nensure that sufficient time is given to the power-up process. The\nmonostable typically takes 4 µs to time out. It then takes typically\n25 µs for each conversion to be completed. The new temperature\nvalue is loaded into the temperature value register and ready for\nreading by the I2C interface.\nA temperature measurement is also initiated every time the one-\nshot method is used. This method requires the user to write to the\none-shot bit in the configuration register when a temperature meas-\nurement is needed. Setting the one-shot bit to 1 starts a tempera-\nture conversion directly after the write operation. The track-and-hold\ngoes into hold approximately 4 µs (monostable time out) after the\nSTOP condition, and a conversion is then initiated. Typically 25 µs\nlater, the conversion is complete and the temperature value register\nis loaded with a new temperature value.\nThe measurement modes are compared with a high temperature\nlimit, stored in an 8-bit read/write register. This is applicable only\nto the AD7414, because the AD7415 does not have an ALERT\npin and subsequently does not have an overtemperature monitoring\nfunction. If the measurement is greater than the high limit, the\nALERT pin is activated (if it has already been enabled in the config-\nuration register). There are two ways to deactivate the ALERT pin\nagain: when the alert reset bit in the configuration register is set to\n1 by a write operation, and when the temperature measured is less\nthan the value in the TLOW register. This ALERT pin is compatible\nwith the SMBus SMBALERT option.\nConfiguration functions consist of\n►Switching between normal operation and full power-down\n►Enabling or disabling the SCL and SDA filters\n►Enabling or disabling the ALERT function\n►Setting the ALERT pin polarityFigure 6. Typical Connection Diagram\nMEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE\nA common method of measuring temperature is to exploit the\nnegative temperature coefficient of a diode, or the base-emitter\nvoltage of a transistor, operated at constant current. Unfortunately,\nthis technique requires calibration to null the effect of the absolute\nvalue of VBE, which varies from device to device. The technique\nused in the AD7414/AD7415  is to measure the change in VBE when\nthe device is operated at two different currents. This is given by\n∆ V BE =KTq × ln N (1)\nwhere:\nK is Boltzmann’s constant.\nq is the charge on the electron (1.6 × 10–19 Coulombs).\nT is the absolute temperature in Kelvins.\nN is the ratio of the two currents.\nFigure 7. Temperature Measurement Technique\nFigure 7  shows the method the AD7414/AD7415  used to measure\nthe ambient device temperature. To measure ΔVBE, the sensor\n(substrate transistor) is switched between operating currents of I\nand N × I. The resulting waveform is passed through a chopper\nstabilized amplifier that performs the functions of amplification and\nrectification of the waveform to produce a dc voltage proportional to\nΔVBE. This voltage is measured by the ADC to give a temperature\noutput in 10-bit, twos complement format.\nData Sheet AD7414/AD7415\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. H | 8 of 17TEMPERATURE DATA FORMAT\nThe temperature resolution of the ADC is 0.25°C, which corre-\nsponds to 1 LSB of the ADC. The ADC can theoretically measure\na temperature span of 255°C; the lowest practical value is limited\nto −40°C due to the device maximum ratings. The A grade can\nmeasure a temperature range of −40°C to +125°C (temperature\ndata format is shown in Table 5 ).\nTable 5.

H | 9 of 17The AD7414 has five internal registers, as shown in Figure 8 . Four\nare data registers, and one is an address pointer register.\nFigure 8. AD7414 Register Structure\nThe AD7415 has three internal registers, as shown in Figure 9 . Two\nare data registers, and one is an address pointer register.\nFigure 9. AD7415 Register Structure\nEach data register has an address pointed to by the address\npointer register when communicating with it. The temperature value\nregister is the only data register that is read-only.\nADDRESS POINTER REGISTER\nThe address pointer register is an 8-bit register that stores an\naddress that points to one of the four data registers of the AD7414\nand one of the two data registers of the AD7415 . The first byte of\nevery serial write operation to the AD7414/AD7415  is the address\nof one of the data registers, which is stored in the address pointer\nregister and selects the data register to which subsequent data\nbytes are written. Only the 2 LSBs of this register are used to select\na data register.\nTable 6. Address Pointer Register\nP7 P6 P5 P4 P3 P2 P1 P0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 Register SelectTable 7.

In the AD7414,\nsix of the MSBs are used (D7 to D2) to set the operating modes\n(see Table 10 ). D0 and D1 are used for factory settings and must\nhave zeros written to them during normal operation.\nTable 10. AD7414 Configuration Register Settings\nD7 Full power-down if = 1.\nD6 Bypass SDA and SCL filtering if = 0.\nD5 Disable ALERT if = 1.\nD4 ALERT is active low if D4 = 0, ALERT is active high if D4 = 1.\nD3Reset the ALERT pin if set to 1. The next temperature conversion has the\nability to activate the ALERT function. The bit status is not stored; thus this\nbit is 0 if read.\nD2Initiate a one shot temperature conversion if set to a 1. The bit status is\nnot stored; thus this bit is 0 if read.\nTable 11.

D0, D1, and D3 to D5\nare used for factory settings and must have zeros written to them\nduring normal operation.\nTable 12.

H | 10 of 17If the AD7414/AD7415  are in power-down mode (D7 = 1), a temper-\nature conversion can still be initiated by the one-shot operation.\nThis involves a write operation to the configuration register and\nsetting the one-shot bit to 1 (D2 = 1), which causes the AD7414/\nAD7415  to power up, perform a single conversion, and power down\nagain. This is a very power efficient mode.\nTEMPERATURE VALUE REGISTER (ADDRESS\n0X00)\nThe temperature value register is a 10-bit, read-only register that\nstores the temperature reading from the ADC in twos complement\nformat. Two reads are necessary to read data from this register.\nTable 13  shows the contents of the first byte to be read, while Table\n14 and Table 15  show the contents of the second byte to be read\nfrom the AD7414 and AD7415, respectively. In Table 14 , D3 to D5\nof the second byte are used as flag bits and are obtained from other\ninternal registers. They function as follows:\nALERT_Flag: The state of this bit is the same as that of the ALERT\npin.\nTHIGH_Flag: This flag is set to 1 when the temperature measured\ngoes above the THIGH limit. It is reset when the second temperature\nbyte ( Table 14 ) is read. If the temperature is still greater than the\nTHIGH limit after the read operation, the flag is again.\nTLOW_Flag: This flag is set to 1 when the temperature measured\ngoes below the TLOW limit. It is reset when the second temperature\nbyte ( Table 14 ) is read. If the temperature is still less than the TLOW\nlimit after the read operation, the flag is set again.\nThe full theoretical span of the ADC is 255°C, but in practice the\ntemperature measurement range is limited to the operating range of\nthe device, −40°C to +125°C for the A grade.\nTable 13.

Therefore, if\nthe value in the temperature value register is greater than the value\nin the THIGH register, the ALERT pin is activated (that is, if ALERT is\nenabled in the configuration register). Because it is an 8-bit register,\nthe temperature resolution is 1°C.\nTable 16. THIGH Register\nD7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nMSB B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0\nAD7414 T LOW REGISTER (ADDRESS 0X03)\nThe TLOW register (see Table 17 ) is an 8-bit read/write register that\nstores the lower limit that deactivates the ALERT output. Therefore,\nif the value in the temperature value register is less than the value\nin the TLOW register, the ALERT pin is deactivated (that is, if ALERT\nis enabled in the configuration register).\nBecause it is an 8-bit register, the temperature resolution is 1°C.\nTable 17.

Reading Two Bytes of Data from the Temperature Value Register\nData Sheet AD7414/AD7415\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 12 of 17Control of the AD7414/AD7415  is carried out via the I2C-compatible\nserial bus. The AD7414/AD7415  are connected to this bus as slave\ndevice, under the control of a master device, such as the processor.\nSERIAL BUS ADDRESS\nLike all I2C-compatible devices, the AD7414/AD7415  have a 7 ‑bit\nserial address. The four MSBs of this address for the AD7414/\nAD7415  are set to 1001. The AD7414/AD7415  are available\nin three versions: AD7414/AD7415 -0, AD7414/AD7415-1, and\nAD7414-3. The first two versions have three different I2C addresses\navailable, which are selected by either tying the AS pin to GND,\nto VDD, or letting the pin float (see Table 4 ). By giving different ad-\ndresses for the four versions, up to eight AD7414s or six AD7415s\ncan be connected to a single serial bus, or the addresses can be\nset to avoid conflicts with other devices on the bus.\nThe serial bus protocol operates as follows.\nThe master initiates data transfer by establishing a START condi-\ntion, defined as a high-to-low transition on the serial data line SDA,\nwhile the serial clock line SCL remains high. This indicates that an\naddress/data stream follows. All slave peripherals connected to the\nserial bus respond to the START condition and shift in the next\neight bits, consisting of a 7-bit address (MSB first) plus an R/ W\nbit, which determines the direction of the data transfer and whether\ndata is written to or read from the slave device.\nThe peripheral whose address corresponds to the transmitted ad-\ndress responds by pulling the data line low during the low period\nbefore the ninth clock pulse, known as the acknowledge bit. All\nother devices on the bus remain idle while the selected device waits\nfor data to be read from or written to it. If the R/ W bit is 0, the\nmaster writes to the slave device. If the R/ W bit is 1, the master\nreads from the slave device.\nData is sent over the serial bus in sequences of nine clock pulses,\neight bits of data followed by an acknowledge bit from the receiver\nof data. Transitions on the data line must occur during the low\nperiod of the clock signal and remain stable during the high period,\nbecause a low-to-high transition when the clock is high may be\ninterpreted as a STOP signal.\nWhen all data bytes have been read or written, stop conditions\nare established. In WRITE mode, the master pulls the data line\nhigh during the 10th clock pulse to assert a STOP condition. In\nREAD mode, the master device pulls the data line high during\nthe low period before the ninth clock pulse. This is known as No\nAcknowledge. The master then takes the data line low during the\nlow period before the 10th clock pulse, then high during the 10th\nclock pulse to assert a STOP condition.\nAny number of bytes of data may be transferred over the serial bus\nin one operation, but it is not possible to mix read and write in one\noperation. The type of operation is determined at the beginning and\ncannot then be changed without starting a new operation.WRITE MODE\nDepending on the register being written to, there are two different\nwrites for the AD7414/AD7415 .\nWriting to the Address Pointer Register for a\nSubsequent Read\nIn order to read data from a particular register, the address pointer\nregister must contain the address of that register. If it does not,\nthe correct address must be written to the address pointer register\nby performing a single-byte write operation, as shown in Figure\n10. The write operation consists of the serial bus address followed\nby the address pointer byte. No data is written to any of the data\nregisters. A read operation is then performed to read the register.\nWriting a Single Byte of Data to the\nConfiguration Register, T HIGH Register, or T LOW\nRegister\nAll three registers are 8-bit registers, so only one byte of data can\nbe written to each register. Writing a single byte of data to one of\nthese registers consists of the serial bus address, the data register\naddress written to the address pointer register, followed by the data\nbyte written to the selected data register. This is illustrated in Figure\n11.\nREAD MODE\nReading data from the AD7414/AD7415  is a 1- or 2-byte operation.\nReading back the contents of the configuration register, the THIGH\nregister, or the TLOW register is a single-byte read operation, as\nshown in Figure 12 . The register address was previously set up\nby a single-byte write operation to the address pointer register.\nOnce the register address has been set up, any number of reads\ncan subsequently be performed from that register without having to\nwrite to the address pointer register again. To read from another\nregister, the address pointer register has to be written to again to\nset up the relevant register address.\nReading data from the temperature value register is a 2-byte\noperation, as shown in Figure 13 . The same rules apply for a 2 ‑byte\nread as a 1-byte read.\nSMBUS ALERT\nThe AD7414 ALERT output is an SMBus interrupt line for devices\nthat want to trade their ability to master for an extra pin. The\nAD7414 is a slave-only device and uses the SMBus ALERT to\nsignal to the host device that it wants to talk. The SMBus ALERT on\nthe AD7414 is used as an overtemperature indicator.\nThe ALERT pin has an open-drain configuration that allows the\nALERT outputs of several AD7414s to be wire-AND’ed together\nwhen the ALERT pin is active low. Use D4 of the configuration\nregister to set the active polarity of the ALERT output. The pow-\ner-up default is active low. The ALERT function can be disabled\nData Sheet AD7414/AD7415\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 13 of 17or enabled by setting D5 of the configuration register to 1 or 0,\nrespectively.\nThe host device can process the ALERT interrupt and simultane-\nously access all SMBus ALERT devices through the alert response\naddress. Only the device that pulled the ALERT low acknowledges\nthe Alert Response Address (ARA). If more than one device pulls\nthe ALERT pin low, the highest priority (lowest address) device wins\ncommunication rights via standard I2C arbitration during the slave\naddress transfer.\nThe ALERT output becomes active when the value in the temper-\nature value register exceeds the value in the THIGH register. It is\nreset when a write operation to the configuration register sets D3 to\n1 or when the temperature falls below the value stored in the TLOW\nregister.\nThe ALERT output requires an external pull-up resistor. This can be\nconnected to a voltage different from VDD, provided the maximum\nvoltage rating of the ALERT output pin is not exceeded. The value\nof the pull-up resistor depends on the application, but it should be\nas large as possible to avoid excessive sink currents at the ALERT\noutput, which can heat the chip and affect the temperature reading.\nPOWER-ON DEFAULTS\nThe AD7414/AD7415  always power up with these defaults:\nAddress pointer register pointing to the temperature value register.\nTHIGH register loaded with 7Fh.\nTLOW register loaded with 80h.\nConfiguration register loaded with 40h.\nNote that the AD7415 does not have any THIGH or TLOW registers.\nOPERATING MODES\nMode 1\nThis is the power-on default mode of the AD7414/AD7415 . In this\nmode, the AD7414/AD7415  does a temperature conversion every\n800 ms and then partially powers down until the next conversion\noccurs.\nIf a one-shot operation (setting D2 of the configuration register to\na 1) is performed between automatic conversions, a conversion is\ninitiated right after the write operation. After this conversion, the part\nreturns to performing a conversion every 800 ms.\nDepending on where a serial port access occurs during a conver-\nsion, that conversion might be aborted. If the conversion is complet-\ned before the part recognizes a serial port access, the temperature\nregister is updated with the new conversion. If the conversion\nis completed after the part recognizes a serial port access, the\ninternal logic prevents the temperature register from being updated,\nbecause corrupt data could be read.A temperature conversion can start anytime during a serial port\naccess (other than a one-shot operation), but the result of that\nconversion is loaded into the temperature register only if the serial\nport access is not active at the end of the conversion.\nMode 2\nThe only other mode in which the AD7414/AD7415  operates is\nthe full power-down mode. This mode is usually used when temper-\nature measurements are required at a very slow rate. The power\nconsumption of the part can be greatly reduced in this mode by\nwriting to the part to go to a full power-down. Full power-down is\ninitiated right after D7 of the configuration register is set to 1.\nWhen a temperature measurement is required, a write operation\ncan be performed to power up the part and put it into one-shot\nmode (setting D2 of the configuration register to a 1). The power-up\ntakes approximately 4 μs. The part then performs a conversion and\nis returned to full power-down. The temperature value can be read\nin the full power-down mode, because the serial interface is still\npowered up.\nPOWER VS. THROUGHPUT\nThe two modes of operation for the AD7414/AD7415  produce\ndifferent power vs. throughput performances. Mode 2 is the sleep\nmode of the part, and it achieves the optimum power performance.\nMode 1\nIn this mode, continuous conversions are performed at a rate of\napproximately one every 800 ms. Figure 14  shows the times and\ncurrents involved with this mode of operation for a 5 V supply.\nAt 5 V, the current consumption for the part when converting is\ntypically 1.1 mA, and the quiescent current is typically 188 µA.\nThe conversion time of 25 µs plus the power-up time of typically\n4 µs contributes 199.3 nW to the overall power dissipation in the\nfollowing way:\n(29 µs/800 ms) × (5 V × 1.1 mA) = 199.3 nW\nThe contribution to the total power dissipated by the remaining time\nis 939.96 µW.\n(799.97 ms/800 ms) × (5 V × 188 µA) = 939.96 µW\nThus the total power dissipated during each cycle is\n199.3 nW + 939.96 µW = 940.16 µW\nFigure 14. Mode 1 Power Dissipation\nData Sheet AD7414/AD7415\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 14 of 17Mode 2\nIn this mode, the part is totally powered down. All circuitry except\nthe serial interface is switched off. The most power efficient way\nof operating in this mode is to use the one-shot method. Write to\nthe configuration register and set the one-shot bit to a 1. The part\npowers up in approximately 4 μs and then performs a conversion.\nOnce the conversion is finished, the device powers down again until\nthe PD bit in the configuration register is set to 0 or the one-shot\nbit is set to 1. Figure 15  shows the same timing as Figure 14\nin mode 1; a one-shot is initiated every 800 ms. If we take the\nvoltage supply to be 5 V, we can work out the power dissipation\nin the following way. The current consumption for the part when\nconverting is 1.1 mA typically, and the quiescent current is 800 nA\ntypically. The conversion time of 25 µs plus the power-up time of\ntypically 4 μs contributes 199.3 nW to the overall power dissipation\nin the following way:\n(29 µs/800 ms) × (5 V × 1.1 mA) = 199.3 nW\nThe contribution to the total power dissipated by the remaining time\nis 4 µW.\n(799.97 ms/800 ms) × (5 V × 800 nA) = 4 µW\nThus the total power dissipated during each cycle is:\n199.3 nW + 4 µW = 4.2 µW\nFigure 15. Mode 2 Power Dissipation\nMOUNTING THE AD7414/AD7415\nThe AD7414/AD7415  can be used for surface or air temperature\nsensing applications. If the device is cemented to a surface with\nthermally conductive adhesive, the die temperature is within about\n0.1°C of the surface temperature, due to the device’s low power\nconsumption. Care should be taken to insulate the back and leads\nof the device from the air if the ambient air temperature is different\nfrom the surface temperature being measured.\nThe ground pin provides the best thermal path to the die, so the\ntemperature of the die is close to that of the printed circuit ground\ntrack. Care should be taken to ensure that this is in good thermal\ncontact with the surface being measured.\nAs with any IC, the AD7414/AD7415  and their associated wiring\nand circuits must be kept free from moisture to prevent leakage\nand corrosion, particularly in cold conditions where condensation\nis more likely to occur. Water-resistant varnishes and conformal\ncoatings can be used for protection. The small size of the AD7414/\nAD7415  packages allows them to be mounted inside sealed metal\nprobes, which provide a safe environment for the devices.SUPPLY DECOUPLING\nThe AD7414/AD7415  should at least be decoupled with a 0.1µF\nceramic capacitor between VDD and GND. This is particularly impor-\ntant if the AD7414/AD7415  are mounted remote from the power\nsupply.\nTEMPERATURE ACCURACY VS. SUPPLY\nThe temperature accuracy specifications are guaranteed for voltage\nsupplies of 3 V and 5.5 V only. Figure 16  gives the typical perform-\nance characteristics of a large sample of parts over the full voltage\nrange of 2.7 V to 5.5 V. Figure 17  gives the typical performance\ncharacteristics of one part over the full voltage range of 2.7 V to 5.5\nV.\nFigure 16.
