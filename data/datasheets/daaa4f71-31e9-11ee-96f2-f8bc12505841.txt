The\nPCAL6416A has built-in level shifting feature that makes these devices extremely flexible\nin mixed signal environments where communication between incompatible I/O voltages\nis required. Its wide V DD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V on the dual power rail allows seamless\ncommunications with next-generation low voltage microprocessors and microcontrollers\non the interface side (SDA/SCL) and peripherals at a higher voltage on the port side.\nThere are two supply voltages for PCAL6416A: V DD(I2C-bus)  and V DD(P) . VDD(I2C-\nbus) provides the supply voltage for the interface at the master side (for example, a\nmicrocontroller) and the V DD(P)  provides the supply for core circuits and Port P. The\nbidirectional voltage level translation in the PCAL6416A is provided through V DD(I2C-bus) .\nVDD(I2C-bus)  should be connected to the V DD of the external SCL/SDA lines. This indicates\nthe V DD level of the I2C-bus to the PCAL6416A, while the voltage level on Port P of the\nPCAL6416A is determined by the V DD(P) .\nThe PCAL6416A contains the PCA6416A register set of four pairs of 8-bit Configuration,\nInput, Output, and Polarity Inversion registers and additionally, the PCAL6416A\nhas Agile I/O, which are additional features specifically designed to enhance the I/\nO. These additional features are: programmable output drive strength, latchable\ninputs, programmable pull-up/pull-down resistors, maskable interrupt, interrupt status\nregister, programmable open-drain or push-pull outputs. The PCAL6416A is a pin-\nto-pin replacement to the PCA6416A, however, the PCAL6416A powers up with all I/\nO interrupts masked. This mask default allows for a board bring-up free of spurious\ninterrupts at power-up.\nAt power-on, the I/Os are configured as inputs. However, the system master can enable\nthe I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for\neach input or output is kept in the corresponding input or output register. The polarity of\nthe Input Port register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register, saving external\nlogic gates. Programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors eliminate the need for discrete\ncomponents.\nThe system master can reset the PCAL6416A in the event of a time-out or other\nimproper operation by asserting a LOW in the RESET  input. The power-on reset puts\nthe registers in their default state and initializes the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine. The\nRESET  pin causes the same reset/initialization to occur without depowering the part.\nNXP SemiconductorsPCAL6416A\nLow-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander with interrupt output, reset, and\nconfiguration registers\nThe PCAL6416A open-drain interrupt ( INT) output is activated when any input state\ndiffers from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the\nsystem master that an input state has changed.\nINT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt\nsignal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data\non its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCAL6416A can\nremain a simple slave device. The input latch feature holds or latches the input pin state\nand keeps the logic values that created the interrupt until the master can service the\ninterrupt. This minimizes the host’s interrupt service response for fast moving inputs.\nThe device Port P outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while\nconsuming low device current.\nOne hardware pin (ADDR) can be used to program and vary the fixed I2C-bus address\nand allow up to two devices to share the same I2C-bus or SMBus.\n2Features and benefits\n•I2C-bus to parallel port expander\n•Operating power supply voltage range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n•Allows bidirectional voltage-level translation and GPIO expansion between:\n–1.8 V SCL/SDA and 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V Port P\n–2.5 V SCL/SDA and 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V Port P\n–3.3 V SCL/SDA and 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V Port P\n–5 V SCL/SDA and 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V Port P\n•Low standby current consumption:\n–1.5 μA typical at 5 V V DD\n–1.0 μA typical at 3.3 V V DD\n•Schmitt trigger action allows slow input transition and better switching noise immunity\nat the SCL and SDA inputs\n–Vhys = 0.18 V (typical) at 1.8 V\n–Vhys = 0.25 V (typical) at 2.5 V\n–Vhys = 0.33 V (typical) at 3.3 V\n–Vhys = 0.5 V (typical) at 5 V\n•5 V tolerant I/O ports\n•Active LOW reset input ( RESET )\n•Open-drain active LOW interrupt output ( INT)\n•400 kHz Fast-mode I2C-bus\n•Internal power-on reset\n•Power-up with all channels configured as inputs\n•No glitch on power-up\n•Noise filter on SCL/SDA inputs\n•Latched outputs with 25 mA drive maximum capability for directly driving LEDs\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78, Class II\n•ESD protection exceeds JESD 22\n–2000 V Human-Body Model (A114-A)\n–1000 V Charged-Device Model (C101)\n•Packages offered: TSSOP24, HWQFN24, VFBGA24, X2QFN24 (LGA, Land Grid\nArray)\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

These registers are effective only when the pin is configured as an input port.\nWhen an input latch register bit is 0, the corresponding input pin state is not latched. A\nstate change in the corresponding input pin generates an interrupt. A read of the input\nregister clears the interrupt. If the input goes back to its initial logic state before the input\nport register is read, then the interrupt is cleared.\nWhen an input latch register bit is 1, the corresponding input pin state is latched. A\nchange of state of the input generates an interrupt and the input logic value is loaded\ninto the corresponding bit of the input port register (registers 0 and 1). A read of the input\nport register clears the interrupt. If the input pin returns to its initial logic state before the\ninput port register is read, then the interrupt is not cleared and the corresponding bit of\nthe input port register keeps the logic value that initiated the interrupt.

When the read is performed on the input port 0 register, the interrupt is\ncleared, assuming there were no additional input(s) that have changed, and bit 4 of the\ninput port 0 register will read ‘1’. The next read of the input port register bit 4 register\nshould now read ‘0’.\nAn interrupt remains active when a non-latched input simultaneously switches state with\na latched input and then returns to its original state. A read of the input register reflects\nonly the change of state of the latched input and also clears the interrupt. The interrupt is\nnot cleared if the input latch register changes from latched to non-latched configuration.\nIf the input pin is changed from latched to non-latched input, a read from the input\nport register reflects the current port logic level. If the input pin is changed from non-\nlatched to latched input, the read from the input register reflects the latched logic level. A\nregister pair write operation is described in Section 8.1 .

If the corresponding\nbit in the Interrupt mask register is set to 0, the interrupt pin will be asserted.\nWhen an input changes state and the resulting interrupt is masked (interrupt mask bit\nis 1), setting the input mask register bit to 0 will cause the interrupt pin to be asserted.\nIf the interrupt mask bit of an input that is currently the source of an interrupt is set to\n1, the interrupt pin will be de-asserted.

At that time, the reset\ncondition is released and the PCAL6416A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine\ninitializes to their default states. After that, V DD(P)  must be lowered to below V POR and\nback up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 9.3 "Power-on\nreset requirements" .\n7.7 Reset input (RESET)\nThe RESET  input can be asserted to initialize the system while keeping the V DD(P)  at\nits operating level. A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET  pin LOW for a\nminimum of t w(rst). The PCAL6416A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are\nchanged to their default state once RESET  is LOW (0). When RESET  is HIGH (1), the\nI/O levels at the P port can be changed externally or through the master. This input\nrequires a pull-up resistor to V DD(I2C-bus)  if no active connection is used.\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

The interrupt is reset when data on the port\nchanges back to the original value or when data is read from the port that generated\nthe interrupt (see Figure 16 ). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the acknowledge\n(ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal. Interrupts\nthat occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to\nthe resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Any change of the I/Os after resetting is\ndetected and is transmitted as INT.\nA pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output\nto an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the\ncontents of the Input Port register.\nThe INT output has an open-drain structure and requires pull-up resistor to V DD(P)  or\nVDD(I2C-bus) , depending on the application. INT should be connected to the voltage source\nof the device that requires the interrupt information.\nWhen using the input latch feature, the input pin state is latched. The interrupt is reset\nonly when data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. The reset occurs in the\nRead mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising\nedge of the SCL signal.\n8Bus transactions\nThe PCAL6416A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and\nPCAL6416A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication\nlines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be\nconnected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages\nof a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n8.1 Write commands\nData is transmitted to the PCAL6416A by sending the device address and setting the\nLeast Significant Bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 8  for device address). The command\nbyte is sent after the address and determines which register receives the data that\nfollows the command byte.\nTwenty-two registers within the PCAL6416A are configured to operate as eleven register\npairs. The eleven pairs are input port, output port, polarity inversion, configuration, output\ndrive strength (two 16-bit registers), input latch, pull-up/pull-down enable, pull-up/pull-\ndown selection, interrupt mask, and interrupt status registers. After sending data to one\nregister, the next data byte is sent to the other register in the pair (see Figure 11  and\nFigure 12 ). For example, if the first byte is sent to Output Port 1 (register 3), the next byte\nis stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).\nThere is no limit on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this way,\nthe host can continuously update a register pair independently of the other registers.\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

Data from the register defined by the command byte is sent by the\nPCAL6416A (see Figure 13  and Figure 16 ). Data is clocked into the register on the rising\nedge of the ACK clock pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read, but\nthe data now reflects the information in the other register in the pair. For example, if Input\nPort 1 is read, the next byte read is Input Port 0.There is no limit on the number of data\nbytes received in one read transmission, but on the final byte received the bus master\nmust not acknowledge the data.\nAfter a subsequent restart, the command byte contains the value of the next register\nto be read in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 was read last before the restart, the\nregister that is read after the restart is the Input Port 0.\n10000AD\nDR0A S0\nSTART condition R/W\nacknowledge\nfrom slave\n002aah046A\nacknowledge\nfrom slaveSDA\nA P\nacknowledge\nfrom masterdata from lower or\nupper byte of register\nDATA (first byte)slave address\nSTOP\nconditionS\n(repeated)\nSTART condition(cont.)\n(cont.)10000AD\nDR1A 0\nR/W\nacknowledge\nfrom slaveslave address\nat this moment master-transmitter becomes master-receiver\nand slave-receiver becomes slave-transmitterNA\nno acknowledge\nfrom masterdata from upper or\nlower byte of register\nDATA (last byte)MSB LSB MSB LSB1/0 001/01/01/01/0 0command byte\nFigure 13.\u2007Read from device registers\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

Also, internal pull-up or pull-down may be used to\neliminate the need for external components. If a driver to an input will never let the input float, a resistor is not needed.\nIf an output in the P port is configured as a push-pull output there is no need for external pull-up resistors. If an output\nin the P port is configured as an open-drain output, external pull-up resistors are required.\nFigure 17.\u2007Typical application\n9.1 Minimizing I DD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs\nWhen the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to V DD through a\nresistor as shown in Figure 17 . Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/\nO V I is about 1.2 V less than V DD(P) . The supply current, I DD(P) , increases as V I becomes\nlower than V DD(P) .\nDesigns needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,\nshould consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to V DD when the\nLED is off. Figure 18  shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 19\nshows V DD(P)  less than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these\nmethods maintain the I/O V I at or above V DD(P)  and prevents additional supply current\nconsumption when the LED is off.\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

By programming these bits the user is changing the number of transistor\npairs or ‘fingers’ that drive the I/O pad.\nFigure 20  shows a simplified output stage. The behavior of the pad is affected by the\nConfiguration register, the output port data, and the current control register. When the\nCurrent Control register bits are programmed to 10b, then only two of the fingers are\nactive, reducing the current drive capability by 50 %.\nVDD(P)\nP0_0 to P0_7\nP1_0 to P1_7Configuration\nregister\n002aah053DECODERPMOS_EN0\nPMOS_EN1\nPMOS_EN2\nPMOS_EN3\nNMOS_EN3\nNMOS_EN2\nNMOS_EN1\nNMOS_EN0Output port\nregisterCurrent Control\nregisterPMOS_EN[3:0]\nNMOS_EN[3:0]\nFigure 20.\u2007Simplified output stage\nReducing the current drive capability may be desirable to reduce system noise.

Power-on reset requires that the device\ngo through a power cycle to be completely reset.

Since these pull-up and pull-down resistors are internal to the device itself, they\ncontribute to the current consumption of the device and must be considered in the overall\nsystem design.\nThe pull-up or pull-down function is selected in registers 48h and 49h, while the resistor\nis connected by the enable registers 46h and 47h. The configuration of the resistors is\nshown in Figure 10 .\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

This current will\nappear as additional I DD upsetting any current consumption measurements.\nIn the same manner, if the resistor is configured as a pull-down and the pin is held HIGH,\ncurrent will flow from the power supply through the pin to the V SS pin. While this current\nwill not be measured as part of I DD, one must be mindful of the 200 mA limiting value\nthrough V SS.\nThe pull-up and pull-down resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with\nvoltage. The resistance specification for these devices spans from 50 kΩ with a nominal\n100 kΩ value. Any current flow through these resistors is additive by the number of pins\nheld HIGH or LOW and the current can be calculated by Ohm’s law. See Figure 28  for a\ngraph of supply current versus the number of pull-up resistors.\n9.5 I2C-bus error recovery techniques\nThere are a number of techniques to recover from error conditions on the I2C-bus. Slave\ndevices like the PCAL6416A use a state machine to implement the I2C protocol and\nexpect a certain sequence of events to occur to function properly. Unexpected events\nat the I2C master can wreak havoc with the slaves connected on the bus. However, it is\nusually possible to recover deterministically to a known bus state with careful protocol\nmanipulation.\nA hard slave reset, either through power-on reset or by activating the RESET  pin, will set\nthe device back into the default state. Of course, this means the input/output pins and\ntheir configuration will be lost, which might cause some system issues.\nA STOP condition, which is only initiated by the master, will reset the slave state machine\ninto a known condition where SDA is not driven LOW by the slave and logically, the slave\nis waiting for a START condition. A STOP condition is defined as SDA transitioning from\nLOW to HIGH while SCL is HIGH.\nIf the master is interrupted during a packet transmission, the slave may be sending data\nor performing an Acknowledge, driving the I2C-bus SDA line LOW. Since SDA is LOW,\nit effectively blocks any other I2C-bus transaction. A deterministic method to clear this\nsituation, once the master recognizes a ‘stuck bus’ state, is for the master to blindly\ntransmit nine clocks on SCL. If the slave was transmitting data or acknowledging, nine\nor more clocks ensures the slave state machine returns to a known, idle state since the\nprotocol calls for eight data bits and one ACK bit. It does not matter when the slave state\nmachine finishes its transmission, extra clocks will be recognized as STOP conditions.\nThe PCAL6416A SCL pin is an input only. If SCL is stuck LOW, then only the bus master\nor a slave performing a clock stretch operation can cause this condition.\nWith careful design of the bus master error recovery firmware, many I2C-bus protocol\nproblems can be avoided.\n10Limiting values\nIn accordance with the Absolute Maximum Rating System (IEC 60134).\nSymbol Parameter Conditions Min Max Unit\nVDD(I2C-bus) I2C-bus supply voltage -0.5 +6.5 V\nVDD(P) supply voltage port P -0.5 +6.5 VTable 31.\u2007Limiting values\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

A more in-depth account\nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow\nsoldering description” .\n17.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached\nto Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides\nboth the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method\nthat is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole\nand Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is\nnot suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high\ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n17.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming\nfrom a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the\nfollowing:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless\npackages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,\nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,\ndue to an increased probability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by\ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,\npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n17.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board\ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are\nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\n17.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

It is imperative that the peak\ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder\npaste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the\npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package\ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with\nTable 38  and Table 39\nPackage reflow temperature (°C)\nVolume (mm³)Package thickness (mm)\n< 350 ≥ 350\n< 2.5 235 220\n≥ 2.5 220 220Table 38.\u2007SnPb eutectic process (from J-STD-020D)\nPackage reflow temperature (°C)\nVolume (mm³)Package thickness (mm)\n< 350 350 to 2000 > 2000\n< 1.6 260 260 260\n1.6 to 2.5 260 250 245\n> 2.5 250 245 245Table 39.\u2007Lead-free process (from J-STD-020D)\nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all\ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow\nsoldering, see Figure 41 .\nPCAL6416A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.
