APPLICATIONS\n5.1 Reset, Power-Down and Start-Up \nWhen RST  is low, the CS8416 enters a low power mode and all internal states are reset, including the con-\ntrol port and registers, and the output s are muted. In Software Mode, when RST  is high, the control port\nbecomes operational, and the desired settings should be lo aded into the control registers. Writing a 1 to the\nRUN bit will then cause the part to leave the low powe r state and begin o peration. After the PLL has settled,\nthe serial audio out puts will be enabled.\nSome options within the CS8416 are controlled by a st art-up mechanism. During the reset state, some of\nthe pins are reconfigured internally to be inputs. Immediately upon exiting the reset state, the level of thesepins is sensed. The pins are then switched to be outputs. This mechanism allows output pins to be used toset alternative modes in the CS8416 by connecting a 47 k\nΩ resistor to between the pin and either VL (HI)\nor DGND (LO). For each mode, every start-up option se lect pin MUST have an ex ternal pull-up or pull-down\nresistor as there are no internal pull-up or pull-down resistors for these startup conditions (except for TX,which has an internal pull-down). In Software Mode, t he only start-up option pins are GPO2, which are used\nto set a chip address bit for the control port in I²C Mode, and SDOUT, which selects between Hardware andSoftware Modes. The Hardware Mode uses ma ny start-up options, which are detailed in Section 15.2 “Hard-\nware Mode Function Selection” on page 46 .\n5.2 ID Code and Revision Code\nThe CS8416 has a register that contains a 4-bit code to indicate that the addressed device is a CS8416.\nThis is useful when other CS84XX family members are resident in the same system, allowing common soft-\nware modules.\nThe CS8416 4-bit revision code is also available. This  allows the software driver for the CS8416 to identify\nwhich revision of the device is in a particular system , and modify its behavior accordingly. To allow for future\nrevisions, it is strongly recommend that the revision code is read into a variable area within the microcon-\ntroller, and used wherever appropriate as revision details become known.\n5.3 Power Supply, Gr ounding, and PCB Layout\nFor most applications, the CS8416 can be operated fr om a single +3.3 V supply, following normal supply\ndecoupling practices (See Figures 5  and 6). For applications where the recovered input clock, output on the\nRMCK pin, is required to be low jitter, then use a se parate, quiet, analog +3.3 V supply for VA, decoupled\nto AGND. Make certain that no digital traces are rout ed near VA, AGND, or FILT as noise may couple and\ndegrade performance. These pins should be well isol ated from switching signals and other noise sources.\nVL sets the level for the digital inputs and ou tputs, as well as the AES/SPDIF receiver inputs.\nExtensive use of powe r and ground planes, ground plane fill in unused  areas and surfac e mount decoupling\ncapacitors are recommended. Decoupling capacitors sh ould be mounted on the same side of the board as\nthe CS8416 to minimize inductance effects, and all de coupling capacitors should be as close to the CS8416\nas possible. See “PLL Filter” on page 53  for layout recommendations for the PLL.\nDS578F3 23CS8416\n6. GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe CS8416 is a monolithic CMOS device that receives  and decodes audio data acco rding to the AES3, IEC60958,\nS/PDIF, and EIAJ CP1201  interface standards.\nThe CS8416 provides an 8:2 multiplexer to select between eight inputs for decoding and to allow an input signal to\nbe routed to an output of the CS8416. Input data can be ei ther differential or single-ended. A low jitter clock is re-\ncovered from the incoming data using a PLL. The decoded audio  data is output through a configurable, 3-wire serial\naudio output port. The channel status and Q-channel subc ode portion of the user data are assembled in registers\nand may be accessed through an SPI or I²C port.\nThree General Purpose Output (GPO) pins are provided to allow a variety of signals to  be accessed under software\ncontrol. In Hardware Mode, dedicated pins are used to se lect audio stream inputs for decoding and transmission to\na dedicated TX pin. Hardware Mode also provi des channel status and user data output pins.\nFigures 5  and 6 show the power supply and external connections to the CS8416 when configured for Software Mode\nand Hardware Mode. Please note that all I/O pins, including RXN and RXP[7:0], operate at the VL voltage.\n6.1 AES3 and S/PDIF Standards Documents\nThis document assumes that the user  is familiar with the AES 3 and S/PDIF data format s. It is advisable to\nhave current copies of the AES3, IEC60958, and IEC6 1937 specifications on hand for easy reference.\nThe latest AES3 standard is available from the Audio Engi neering Society or ANSI at www.aes.org  or at\nwww.ansi.org .

It is available from the\nAES as reprint 3518.\n7. SERIAL AUDIO OUTPUT PORT\nA 3-wire serial audio output port is provided. The port ca n be adjusted to suit the attac hed device by setting the con-\ntrol registers. The following parameters are adjustable: mast er or slave, serial clock frequency, audio data resolu-\ntion, left- or right-justification of the data relative to lef t/right clock, optional one-bit cell delay of the first data bit,  the\npolarity of the bit clock, and the polarity of the left/right  clock. By setting the appropriate control bits, many formats\nare possible. \nFigure 7 shows a selection of common output formats, along with  the control bit settings. A special AES3 direct out-\nput format is included, which allows the serial output port access to the V, U, and C bits embedded in the serial audio\ndata stream. When using the part in AES3 direct-output format, the de-emphasis filter must be off (see Section 14.4\non page 38 ). The P bit, which would normally be a parity bit, is repl aced by a Z bit, which is used to indicate the start\nof each block. The received channel st atus block start signal is also available as the RCBL pin in Hardware Mode\nand through a GPO pin in Software Mode.\nIn master mode, the left/right clock (OLRCK) and the serial bit clock (OSCLK ) are outputs, derived from the recov-\nered RMCK clock. In slave mode, OLRCK and OSCLK are in puts. OLRCK is normally synchronous to the appropri-\nate master clock, but OSCLK can be asynchronous and disc ontinuous if required. By ap propriate phasing of OLRCK\nand control of the serial clocks, mult iple CS8416’s can share one serial port. OLRCK should be continuous, but the\nduty cycle can be less than the specified typical value of 50% if enough serial clocks are present in each phase to\n24 DS578F3CS8416\nclock all the data bits. When in slave mode, the serial audio output port cannot be set for right-justified data. The\nCS8416 allows immediate mute of the serial audio output po rt audio data by the MUTESAO bit of Control Register 1. \nFor more information about serial audio formats, refer to the Cirrus Logic applications  note AN282, “The 2-Channel\nSerial Audio Interface: A Tutorial”, available at www.cirrus.com . \nFigure 7.

Refer to Figure 8  for the AES3 data format diagram.\nWhen the serial output port is conf igured as slave, depending on the relative frequency of OLRCK to the\ninput AES3 data (Z/X) preambl e frequency, the data will be  slipped or repeated at the output of the CS8416.\nAfter a fixed delay from the Z/X preamble (a few periods  of the internal clock, which is running at 256Fs),\nthe circuit will look back in  time until the previous Z/ X preamble and check which of the followi ng conditions\noccurred:\n1. If during that time, the internal data buffer was not updated, a slip has occurred. Data from the previous\nframe will be output and OSLIP will be set to 1. Due to the OSLIP bit being “sticky,” it will remain 1 until\nthe register is read. It w ill then be reset unt il another slip/repea t condition occurs.\n2. If during that time the internal  data buffer did not update between  two positive or negative edges (de-\npending on OLRPOL) of OLRCK, a repeat has occurred.  In this case, the buffer data was updated twice,\nso the part has lost one frame of data . This event will also trigger OSLIP to be set to 1. Due to the OSLIP\nbit being “sticky,” it will remain 1 until the register is read. It will then  be reset until another slip/repeat\ncondition occurs.\n3. If during that time, it did see a positive edge on  OLRCK (or negative edge if the SOLRPOL is set to 1)\nno slip or repeat ha s happened. Due to  the OSLIP bit being “sticky,” it will remain in its previous state\nuntil either the register is read or a slip/repeat condition occurs.\nIf the user reads OSLIP as soon as the event triggers, over a long pe riod of time the rate of occurring INT\nwill be equal to the differ ence in freq uency between the input AES data and the sl ave serial output LRCK.\nThe CS8416 uses a hysteresis window when a slip/repe at event occurs. The slip/repeat is triggered when\nan edge of OLRCK passes a window size from the beginning of the Z/X preamble. Without the hysteresiswindow, jitter on OLRCK with a frequency very close to Fs  could slip back and forth,  causing multiple slip/re-\npeat events. The CS8416 uses a hysteresis window to ensure that only one slip/repeat happens even with\njitter on OLRCK\nFigure 8.

In\nmaster mode, the latency through the part is dependent on the input sample frequency. The typical delaythrough the part from the beginning of the preamble to the active edge of OLRCK for the various samplefrequencies is given in Table 1 . In master mode without the de-emphasis filter engaged, the latency of the\naudio data will be 3 frames.\nWhen OLRCK is configured as a slave, any synchronize d input within +/-28%(1/Fs) from the positive or neg-\native edge of OLRCK (depending on the setting of SOLRPOL in register 05h) will be treated as being sam-\npled at the same time. Since the CS8416 has no contro l of the OLRCK in slave mode, the latency of the\ndata through the par t will be a multiple of 1/Fs plus th e delay between OLRCK and the preambles.\nBoth of these conditions are within the to lerance range set fort h in the AES11 standard.Fs (kHz) Delay (ns)\n32 98.0\n44.1 80.5\n48 78.064 67.096 57.5\n192 47.0\nTable 1. Typical Delays by Frequency Values\nDS578F3 27CS8416\n8. S/PDIF RECEIVER\nThe CS8416 includes an AES3/SPDIF digital audio receiver. The receiver accepts and decodes bi-phase encoded\naudio and digital data according to the AES3, IEC60958 (S/PDIF) , and EIAJ CP-1201 inte rface standards. The re-\nceiver consists of an analog differenti al input stage, driven through analog input pins RXP0 to RXP7 and a common\nRXN, a PLL based clock recovery circuit, and a decoder which separates the audio data from the channel status\nand user data. External components are used to terminat e the incoming data cables and isolate the CS8416. These\ncomponents are detailed in “External AES3/SPDIF/IEC60958 Rece iver Components” on page 49 . Figure 9  shows\nthe input structure of the receiver.    \n8.1 8:2 S/PDIF I nput Multiplexer\n8.1.1 General\nThe CS8416 employs a 8:2 S/PDIF input multiplexer to  accommodate up to eight channels of input digital\naudio data. Digital audio data may be  single-ended or differ ential. Differential inpu ts utilize RXP[7:0] and\na shared RXN. Single ended signals are accommodate d by using the RXP[7:0] inputs and AC coupling\nRXN to ground.\nAll active inputs to the CS8416 8:2 input multiplexer should be coupled through a capacitor as these inputs\nare biased at VL/2 when selected. These inputs are floating when not selected. Unused multiplexer inputs\nshould be left floating or tied to AGND. The recommended capacitor value is 0.01 μF to 0.1 μF. The rec-\nommended dielectrics for the AC coupling capacitors are C0G or X7R.\nThe input voltage range for the input multiplexer is se t by the I/O power supply pin, VL. The input voltage\nof the RXP[7:0] and RXN pins is also set by the leve l of VL. Input signals with voltage levels above VL or\nbelow DGND may degrade performance or damage the part.\n8.1.2 Software Mode\nThe multiplexer select line control is  accessed through bits RXSEL[2:0] in control port register 04h. The\nmultiplexer defaults to RXP0.+\n-VL\n22 k Ω\n(22000/N) Ω 22 k ΩVL = 5.0 V: 2.3 k Ω\nVL = 3.3 V: 3.0 k Ω\nAGNDRXN\nRXP[7:0]\nVL = 5.0 V: (1500 + 800/N) Ω\nVL = 3.3 V: (1500 + 1500/N) Ω(22000/N) Ω\nFigure 9.  Receiv er Input StructureIf RXP[7:0] is selected by either the r eceiver MUX or the TX passthrough MUX, N=1.\nIf RXP[7:0] is selected by both the receiver MUX and the TX passthrough MUX, N=2.\nIf RXP[7:0] is not selected at all, N=0 (i.e. high impedance).\n28 DS578F3CS8416\nThe second output of the input multiplexer is used to  provide the selected input as a source to be output\non a GPO pin. This pass through signal is selected by  TXSEL[2:0] in control port register 04h. This single-\nended signal is resolved to full-rail, but is not de-jittered before it is output.\n8.1.3 Hardware Mode\nIn Hardware Mode the input to the decoder is selected by  dedicated pins, RXSEL[1:0].\nThe pass through signal is selected by dedicated pins, TXSEL[1:0] for output on the dedicated TX pin.\nThis single-ended signal is resolved to full-ra il, but is not de-jittered before it is output.\nSelectable inputs are restricted to RXP0 to RXP3 for both the receiver and the TX output pin. These inputs\nare selected by RXSEL[1:0] and  TXSEL[1:0] respectively.\n8.2 OMCK System  Clock Mode\nA special clock switching mode is available that allows the OMCK clock input to automatically replace\nRMCK when the PLL becomes unlocked. This is accomp lished without spurious transitions or glitches on\nRMCK. In Hardware Mode this feature is enabled by a transition (rising edge active) on the OMCK pin after\nreset. Therefore to not enable the clock switching feature in Hardware Mode, OMCK should be tied to DGNDor VL. However, in Hardwa re Mode, once the clock switching feature has been enabled, it can only be dis-\nabled by resetting the part. In Software Mode the automatic clock switching feature is enabled by settingSWCLK bit in Control1 register to a “1”. Additiona lly in Software Mode, OMCK can be manually forced to\noutput on RMCK by using the FSWCLK bit in the Control0 register.\nWhen the clock switching feature is enabled, OSCLK and OLRCK are derived from the OMCK input when\nthe clock has been switched and the serial port is in  master mode. When clock switching is enabled and the\nPLL is not locked, OLRCK will be OMCK/256 and OSCLK will be OMCK/4 . When the PLL loses lock, the\nfrequency of the VCO drops to ~750 kHz. When this  system clock mode is not enabled, the OSCLK and\nOLRCK will be based on the VCO when the PLL is not locked and has reac hed its steady-state idle frequen-\ncy. Table 2  shows an example of output clocks based on clock switching being enabled or disabled.  \n8.3 Clock Recover y and PLL Filter\nPlease see “PLL Filter” on page 53  for a general description of the PL L, selection of recommended PLL filter\ncomponents, and layout considerations.

GENERAL PURP OSE OUTPUTS\nThree General Purpose Outputs (GPO) ar e provided to allow the equipment designer flexib ility in configuring the\nCS8416. Fourteen signals are available to be routed to an y of the GPO pins. The outputs of the GPO pins are set\nthrough the GPOxSEL[3:0] bits in the Control2 (02h) and Co ntrol3 (03h) registers.  All GPO pins default to GND\nafter reset.\nGPO pins may be configured to provide the following data:   \nNotes:\n1.

GPO Pin Configurations\n30 DS578F3CS8416\n10.ERROR AND STATUS REPORTING\n10.1 General\nWhile decoding the incoming bi-phase encoded data str eam, the CS8416 has the ab ility to identify various\nerror conditions.\n10.1.1 Software Mode\nSoftware Mode allows the most flex ibility in reading errors. When unma sked, bits in the Receiver Error\nregister (0Ch) indicate the following errors:\n1. QCRC – CRC error in Q subcode data.\n2. CCRC – CRC error in channel status data.3. UNLOCK – PLL is not locked to incoming data stream.\n4. V – Data Validity bit is set.\n5. CONF – The logical OR of UNLOCK and BIP. The input data stream may be near error condition due \nto jitter degradation.\n6. BIP – Biphase encoding error.\n7. PAR – Parity error in incoming data.\nThe error bits are “sticky,” meaning that they are set on the first occu rrence of the associated error and\nwill remain set until th e user reads the regist er through the c ontrol port. This enables the register to log all\nunmasked errors that occurred since the last time the register was read.\nAs a result of the bits “stickiness,” it is necessary to  perform two reads on these registers to see if the error\ncondition still exists.\nThe Receiver Error Mask register (06h) allows masking of  individual errors. The bits in this register default\nto 00h and serve as masks for the corresponding bits of  the Receiver Error register. If a mask bit is set to\n1, the error is unmasked, wh ich implies the following: it s occurrence will be report ed in the receiver error\nregister, induce a pulse on RERR, in voke the occurrence of a RERR interrupt, and affect the current audio\nsample according to the status of the HOLD bits . The exceptions are the QCRC and CCRC errors, which\ndo not affect the current audio  sample, even if unmasked.\nThe HOLD bits allow a choice of:• Holding the previous sample\n• Replacing the current sample with zero (mute)\nOR• Not changing the current audio sample\n10.1.2 Hardware Mode\nIn Hardware Mode, the user may only choose betw een Non-Validity Receiver Error (NVERR) or Receiver\nError (RERR) by pulling the NV/RERR pin low or high, respectively. T he pull-up/pu ll-down condition will\nbe sensed on start-up , and the approp riate error reporting will be set.\nRERR – The previous audio sample is held and passed to the serial audio output port if the validity bit is\nhigh, or a parity, bi-phase, confidence or PLL lock error occurs during the current sample.\nNVERR – The previous audio sample is held and passed  to the serial audio output port if a parity, bi-\nphase, confidence or PLL lock erro r occurs during the current sample.\nDS578F3 31CS8416\n10.2 Non-Audio Detection\nAn AES3 data stream may be used to convey non-audio data, thus it is important to know whether the in-\ncoming AES3 data stream is digital audio or not. This in formation is typically convey ed in channel status bit\n1, which is extracted automatically by the CS8416. Ho wever, certain non-audio sources, such as AC-3™ or\nMPEG encoders, may not adhere to th is convention, and the bit may no t be properly set. The CS8416 AES3\nreceiver can detect such non-audio data through the use of an autodetect module. The autodetect moduleis similar to autodetect softwar e used in Cirrus Logic DSPs. \nIf the AES3 stream contains sync codes in  the proper format for IEC61937 or DTS\n® data transmission, an\ninternal AUTODETECT signal will be  asserted. If th e sync codes no longer ap pear after a certain amount\nof time, autodetection will time-out  and AUTODETECT will be de-asserted  until another format is detected.\nThe AUDIO  signal is the logical OR of AUTODETECT an d the received channel status bit 1 (as decoded\naccording to the CHS bit in the Control1 register). \nIn Hardware Mode, AUDIO  is output on pin 15. In Software Mode, AUDIO  is available through the GPO pins.\nIf non-audio data is detected, the data is still proces sed exactly as if it were no rmal audio. The exception is\nthe use of de-emphasis auto-select feature which will bypass the de-emphasis filter  if the input stream is\ndetected to be non-audio. It is up to the user to mute the outputs as required.\n10.2.1 Format Detection\nIn Software Mode, the CS8416 can automatically dete ct various serial audio input formats. The Format\nDetect Status regi ster (0Bh) is used to indica te a detected format . The register will indicate if uncom-\npressed PCM data, IEC61937 data, DTS_LD data, DTS_ CD data, or digital silence was detected. Addi-\ntionally, the IEC61937 Pc/Pd burst preambles are av ailable in registers 23h-26h. See the register\ndescriptions for more information.\n10.3 Interrupts\nThe CS8416 has a comprehe nsive interrupt capability. The INT sig nal, available in Software Mode, indi-\ncates when an interrupt condition has occurred and may be  output on one of the GPOs. It can also be set\nthrough bits INT[1:0] in the Control1 register (01h) to be active low, acti ve high or active low with no active\npull-up transistor. This last mode is used for active low, wired-OR hook- ups, with multiple peripherals con-\nnected to the microcontroller interrupt input pin.\nMany conditions can cause an interrupt, as listed in th e interrupt status register descriptions. Each source\nmay be masked off thro ugh mask register bi ts. In addition, each source ma y be set to risi ng edge, falling\nedge, or level sensitive. Combined with the option of le vel sensitive or edge sens itive modes within the mi-\ncrocontroller, many different config urations are possible, depending on the needs of the equipment design-\ner. Refer to the register descriptions for the Interr upt Mask (07h), Interrupt Mo de MSB (08h), Interrupt Mode\nLSB (09h), and Interrupt 1 Status (0Dh) registers\n32 DS578F3CS8416\n11.CHANNEL STATUS AN D USER-DATA HANDLING\n“Channel Status Buffer Management” on page 51  describes Channel Status and User data control.\n11.1 Software Mode\nIn Software Mode, several options are available for acce ssing the Channel Status and  User data that is en-\ncoded in the received AES3/SPDIF stream. \nThe first option allows access directly through regist ers. The first 5 bytes of the Channel Status block are\ndecoded into the Receiver Channel Status Registers 19h - 22h. Registers 19h - 1Dh contain the A channel\nstatus data. Registers 1Eh - 22h contain the B channel status data.\nReceived Channel Status (C), User (U), and EMPH  bits may also be output to the GPO pins by appropriately\nsetting the GPOxSEL bits in control port registers 02h  and 03h. In serial port master mode, OLRCK and\nRCBL can be made available to qualify the U data output. In serial port slave mode, VLRCK and RCBL canbe made available to qualify the U data output. VLRCK is a virtual word clock, equal to the receiver recov-ered sample rate, that can be used to frame the C/ U output. VLRCK and RCBL are available through the\nGPO pins. Figure 10  illustrates timing of the C and U data and their related signals.\nThe user may also access all of the C and U bits dire ctly from the output data stream (SDOUT) by setting\nbits SORES[1:0]=11 (AES3 Direct Mo de) in the Serial Audio Data Form at register (05h) . The appropriate\nbits can be stripped from the SDOUT signal by external control logic such as a DSP or microcontroller.\nIf the incoming User data bits have been encoded as Q-channel subcode, the data is decoded, buffered,\nand presented in 10 consecut ive register locations (0Eh-17h). An interrupt may be enabled to indicate the\ndecoding of a new Q-channel block, whic h may be read through the control port.\nThe encoded Channel St atus bits which indicate sample word length are decoded according to AES3-1992\nor IEC 60958. The number of auxiliary bi ts are reported in bits 7 to 4 of the Receiver Channe l Status register\n(0Ah).\n11.2 Hardware Mode\nIn Hardware Mode, Received Channel Status (C), and Us er (U) bits are output on pins 19 and 18. In serial\nport master mode, OLRCK and RCBL are made av ailable to qualify the C and U data output. Figure 10  il-\nlustrates timing of the C and U data and their related signals.\nThe user may also access a ll of the C and U bits directly from the output data stream (SDOUT) by pulling\nthe AUDIO  and C pins high through 47 k Ω resistors to VL (AES3 Direct Mo de). The appropriate bits can be\nstripped from the SDOUT signal by external control logic such as a DSP or microcontroller. Only OLRCK in\nmaster mode is available to qualify the U output. See “Hardware Mode Function Selection” on page 46  and\n“Hardware Mode Equivalent Register Settings” on page 47  to configure these pins..\nFigure 10.

The operation of the control port ma y be completely asynchronous with respect to the audio\nsample rates. However, to avoid potential interference pr oblems, the control port pins should remain static if no op-\neration is required.\nThe control port has 2 modes: SPI and I²C, with the CS84 16 acting as a slave device. SPI  Mode is selected if there\nis a high to low transition on the AD0/CS  pin, after the RST  pin has been brought high. I²C Mode is selected by con-\nnecting the AD0/CS  pin through a resistor to VL or DGND, ther eby permanently selecting the desired AD0 bit ad-\ndress state.\n12.1 SPI Mode\nIn SPI Mode, CS  is the CS8416 chip select signal, CCLK is the control port bit clock (input into the CS8416\nfrom the microcontroller), CDIN is the input data line from the microcontr oller, CDOUT is the output data line\nto the microcontroller. Data is clocked in on the rising edge of CCLK and out on the falling edge.\nFigure 11  shows the operation of the co ntrol port in SPI Mode. To write to a register, bring CS  low. The first\nseven bits on CDIN form the chip address and must be  0010000. The eighth bit is a read/write indicator\n(R/W ), which should be low to write. The next eight bi ts include the 7-bit Memory Address Pointer (MAP),\nwhich is set to the address of the r egister that is to be updated. The ne xt eight bits are the data which will\nbe placed into the register designated by the MAP. Du ring writes, the CDOUT output stays in the Hi-Z state.\nIt may be externally pulled high or low with a 47 k Ω resistor, if desired. \nTo read a register, the MAP has to be set to the corr ect address by executing a partial write cycle which\nfinishes (CS  high) immediately after the MAP byte. To begin a read, bring CS  low, send out the chip address\nand set the read/write bit (R/W ) high. The next falling edge of CCLK will clock out the MS B of the addressed\nregister (CDOUT will leave the high  impedance state). The MAP automatically increm ents, so data for suc-\ncessive registers will appear consecutively.\nMAP\nMSB LSBDATA\nbyte 1 byte nR/W R/WADDRESSCHI P\nADDRESSCHIP\nCDI NCCLKCS\nCDOUTMSB LSB MSB LSB0010000 0010000\nMAP = Memory Address Pointer, 8 bits, MSB firstHigh Impedance\nFigure 11.  Control Port Timing in SPI Mode\n34 DS578F3CS8416\n12.2 I²C Mode\nIn I²C Mode, SDA is a bidirectional data line. Data is cl ocked into and out of the part by the clock, SCL. There\nis no CS  pin. Pins AD0 and AD1 form the two least significant bits of the chip address and should be con-\nnected through a resistor to VL or DGND as desired.  The GPO2 pin is used to set the AD2 bit by connecting\na 47 k Ω resistor from the GPO2 pin to VL or to DGND. The states of the pins are sensed while the CS8416\nis being reset.\nThe signal timings for a read and write cycle are shown in Figures 12  and 13. A Start condition is defined\nas a falling transition of SDA while th e clock is high. A Stop condition is a rising transition while the clock is\nhigh. All other transitions of SDA occur while the clock is  low. The first byte sent to the CS8416 after a Start\ncondition consists of a 7-bit chip address field and a R/W  bit (high for a read, low for a write). The upper 4\nbits of the 7-bit address field are fixed at 0010. To co mmunicate with a CS8416, the chip address field, which\nis the first byte sent to the CS8416,  should match 0010 followed by the settings of the AD2, AD1, and AD0\npins. The eighth bit of the address is the R/W  bit. If the operation is a write, the next byte includes the Mem-\nory Address Pointer (MAP) which selects the register to be read or writte n. If the operation is a read, the\ncontents of the re gister pointed to  by the MAP will be output. The M AP automatically in crements, so data\nfrom successive regist ers will appear consec utively. Each byte is separated  by an acknowledge bit (ACK).\nThe ACK bit is output from the CS8416 after each input byte is read, and is input to the CS8416 from themicrocontroller after each transmitted byte. \nNote that the read operation can not set the MAP, so an aborted write operation is used as a preamble. As\nshown in Figure 13 , the write operation is aborted after the ac knowledge for the MAP byte by sending a stop\ncondition.\n4     5     6     7   24  25\nSCL\nCHIP ADDRESS (WRITE) MAP BYTE DATA DATA +1     \nSTARTACK\nSTOPACK ACK ACK0   0   1   0   AD2   AD1   AD0   0SDA       6    5    4    3    2    1    0   7     6         1    0 7     6         1    0 7    6     1    0 0     1     2     3   8     9   12   16   17  18    19   10   11   13   14  15   27   28 26\nDATA +n     \n0\nFigure 12.

If a mask bit is set to 0, the error is masked, meaning that its occu rrence will not\nappear in the receiver error register , will not affect the RERR pin, will not affect the RERR interrupt, and will\nnot affect the current audio sample. The CCRC and QCRC  bits behave differently from the other bits: they\ndo not affect the current audio sample even wh en unmasked. This register defaults to 00h.\n14.9 Interrupt Mask (07h)\nThe bits of this register se rve as a mask for the Interrupt Status register. If a mask bit is set to 1, the error\nis unmasked, meaning that its occurr ence will affect the INT pin and the status register. If a mask bit is set\nto 0, the error is masked, meaning th at its occurrence will not affect the internal INT signal or the status reg-\nister. The bit positions align with the corresponding bits  in Interrupt Status register. This register defaults to\n00h.\nThe INT signal may be selected to output on the GPO pins. See “General Purpose Outputs” on page 29 .\n14.10 Interrupt Mode MSB (08h) and Interrupt Mode LSB(09h)\nThe two Interrupt Mode registers form a 2-bit code for each Interrupt Status regi ster function. There are\nthree ways to set the INT pin active in accordance with  the interrupt condition. In the Rising edge active\nmode, the INT pin becomes active on the arrival of the interrupt condit ion. In the Falling edge active mode,\nthe INT pin becomes active on the removal of the interr upt condition. In Level active mode, the INT interrupt\npin becomes active during the interrupt condition. Be aware that the active level (Active High or Low) onlydepends on the INT[1:0] bits.

The Fso is determined by OMCK, whos e frequency is assumed to be 256*Fso. ORR is rep-\nresented as an unsigned 2-bit integer and a 6-bit fracti onal part. The value is meaningful only after the PLL\nhas reached lock. For example, if the OMCK is 12.288 MHz, Fso would be 48 kHz (48 kHz =\n12.288 MHz/256).

Hardware Mode is\nselected by connecting the 47 k Ω pull-up/down resistor on the SDOUT pin to ground. Various pins change function\nin Hardware Mode, described in Section 15.2 “Hardware Mode Fu nction Selection” on page 46 .\nHardware Mode data flow is shown in Figure 15 . Audio data is input through th e AES3/SPDIF receiver, and routed\nto the serial audio output port. The decoded C and U bits are also output, clocked at both edges of OLRCK (mastermode only, see Figure 10 ).\nAn error in the incoming audio stream will be indicated on the NV /RERR pin. This pin can be configured in one of\ntwo ways. If RERR is chosen by pulling NV/RERR to VL, th e previous audio sample is held and passed to the serial\naudio output port if the validity bit is high, or a parity, bi -phase, confidence or PLL lock error occurs during the current\nsample. If NVERR is chosen by pulling NV/RERR to DGND, on ly parity, bi-phase, confidence or PLL lock error\ncause the previous audio sample to be held.\n15.1 Serial Audio Port Formats\nIn Hardware Mode, only a limited number of alte rnative serial audio port formats are available. Table 5  de-\nfines the equivalent Software Mode bit settings for each format. \nThe start-up options, shown in Table 4 , allow choice of the serial audio outp ut port as a master or slave, and\nthe serial audio po rt format.    \n15.2 Hardware Mode Function Selection\nHardware Mode and several options for Hardwa re Mode are selected  by pulling CS8416 pins up to VL or\ndown to DGND through a 47 k Ω resistor. These settings are sensed immediately after RST  is released. ForNV/RERR\nPower supply pins (VA, VD, and VL), AGND, DGND, the reset pin (RST) and the PLL filter pin (FILT)\nare omitted from the diagram.

The dig-\nital audio specifications for professional use ca ll for a balanced receiver, using XLR connectors, with\n110 Ω± 20% impedance. The XLR connector on the receiver should have female pins with a male shell.\nSince the receiver has a very high input impedance, a 110 Ω resistor should be placed across the receiver\nterminals to match the line impedance, as shown in Figures 16  and 17. Although transformers are not re-\nquired by the AES specification,  they are strongly recommended.\nIf some isolation is desired with out the use of transformers, a 0.01 μF capacitor should be placed in series\nwith each input pin (RXP[7:0] and RXN) as shown in Figure 17 . However, if a transformer is not used, high\nfrequency energy could be coupled into the re ceiver, causing degradation in analog performance.\nFigures 16  and 17 show an optional (recommen ded) DC blocking capacitor (0.1 μF to 0.47 μF) in series with\nthe cable input. This improves the robustness of the re ceiver, preventing the satu ration of the transformer,\nor any DC current flow, if a DC voltage is present on the cable.\nIn the case of the consumer interface, the standards call for an unbalanced circuit having a receiver imped-\nance of 75 Ω ±5%. The connector for the consumer interface is an RCA phono socket. The receiver circuit\nfor the consumer inte rface is shown in Figure 18 . An implementation of the Input S/PDIF Multiplexer using\nthe consumer interf ace is shown in Figure 19 .\nThe circuit shown in Figure 20  may be used when external RS422 re ceivers, optical receivers or other\nTTL/CMOS logic outputs drive the CS8416 receiver section. \nIn the configuration of systems, it is important to avoid ground loops and DC current flowing down the shield\nof the cable that could result when boxes with diffe rent ground potentials are connected. Generally, it is\ngood practice to ground the shield to the chassis of the transmitting unit, and connect the shield through a\ncapacitor to chassis ground at the receiver. However, in  some cases it is advantageous to have the ground\nof two boxes held to the same potential, and the cable shield might be depended upon to make that electrical\nconnection. Generally, it is a good idea to provide the option of grounding or capacitively coupling the shield\nto the chassis.\n16.2 Isolating Transformer Requirements\nPlease refer to the application note AN134: AES and SPDIF Recomm ended Transformers  for resources on\ntransformer selection.\n1XLR\nTwisted\nPair110 Ω\n110 ΩCS8416\nRXP0\nRXN* See Text\n1XLR\nTwisted\nPair110 Ω\n110 ΩCS841 6\nRXP0\nRXN0.01 F μ\n0.01 F μ*S e eT e x t\nFigure 16.

TTL/CMOS Input Circuit\nDS578F3 51CS8416\n17.CHANNEL STATUS BUFFER MANAGEMENT\n17.1 AES3 Channel Status  (C) Bit Management\nThe CS8416 contains sufficient RAM to store the first 5 bytes of C data for both A and B channels\n(5 x 2 x 8 = 80 bits). The user may read from this buffer’s RAM through the control port.\nThe buffering scheme involves two buffers, named D and E, as shown in Figure 21 . The MSB of each byte\nrepresents the first bit in the serial C data stream. For example, the MSB of byte 0 (which is at control port\naddress 19h) is the consumer/profess ional bit for channel status block A.\nThe first buffer (D) accepts incoming C data from the AES receiver. The 2nd buffer (E) accepts entire blocks\nof data from the D buffer. The E buffer is also accessibl e from the control port, allowing reading of the first\nfive bytes of C data.\nThe complete C data may be obtained through the C pin in Hardware Mode and through one of the GPO\npins in Software Mode. The C data is serially shifted out of the CS8416 clocked by  the rising and falling\nedges of OLRCK.\n17.2 Accessing the E Buffer\nThe user can monitor the incoming data by reading the E buffer, which is mapped into the register space ofthe CS8416, through the control port.\nThe user can configure the interrupt enable register to cause interrupts to occur whenever D to E buffer\ntransfers occur. This allows determination of the a llowable time periods to interact with the E buffer.\nAlso provided is a D to E inhibit bit in the Control2 re gister (02h). This may be us ed whenever “long” control\nport interactions are occurri ng or for debugging purposes.\nA flowchart for reading the E buffer is shown in Figure 22 . Since a D to E interrupt occurs just after reading,\nthere is a substantial time interval until the next D to E transfer (appro ximately 192 frames worth of time).\nThis is usually enough time to access the E da ta without having to inhibit the next transfer.\n17.2.1 Serial Copy Mana gement System (SCMS)\nIn Software Mode, the CS8416 allows read access to all the channel status bits. For consumer mode\nSCMS compliance, the host microcontroller needs to read and interpret the Category Code, Copy bit and\nL bit appropriately.\nIn Hardware Mode, the SCMS protocol can be followed by either using the COPY and ORIG output pins,\nor by using the C bit serial output pin. These options are documented in Section 15. “Hardware Mode” on\npage 46 .\n52 DS578F3CS8416\nControl\nPort\nRegistersFrom\nAES3\nReceiver\nE19 words8-bits 8-bitsAB\nDReceived\nData\nBuffer5 words\nC Data Serial Output\nFigure 21.

Flowchart for Reading the E Buffer\nDS578F3 53CS8416\n18.PLL FILTER\n18.1 General\nAn on-chip Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is used to recover the clock from the incoming data stream. Figure 23\nis a simplified diagram of the PLL. When the PLL is lock ed to an bi-phase encoded input stream, it is updat-\ned at each preamble in the bi-phase encoded stre am. This occurs at twice the sampling frequency, FS.\nThere are some applications where low jitter in the re covered clock, presented on  the RMCK pin, is impor-\ntant. For this reason, the PLL has been designed to ha ve good jitter attenuation characteristics, as shown\nin Figure 25 . In addition, the PLL has been designed to onl y use the preambles (PDU R=0) of the bi-phase\nencoded stream to provide lock update information to the PLL. This results in the PLL being immune to data\ndependent jitter affects because the preambles do not vary with the data.\nThe PLL has the ability to lock onto a wide range of input  sample rates with no ex ternal compo nent changes.\nIf the sample rate of the input subsequently change s, for example in a varispeed application, the PLL will\nonly track up to ±12.5% from the nominal center sample  rate. The nominal center sample rate is the sample\nrate that the PLL first locks onto upon application of  an bi-phase encoded data stream or after enabling the\nCS8416 clocks by setting the RUN c ontrol bit. If the 12.5% sample rate limit is exceeded, the PLL will return\nto its wide lock range mode and re-acquire a new nominal center sample rate.    \n18.2 External Filter Components\n18.2.1 General\nThe PLL behavior is affected by the external filter component values. Figures 5  and 6 shows the recom-\nmended configuration of the two capacitors and one resistor that comprise the PLL filter. In Table 6 , the\ncomponent values shown have a high corner frequency jit ter attenuation curve, take a short time to lock,\nand offer good output jitter performance. Lock time s are worst case for an Fsi transition of 192 kHz.\nIt is important to treat the PLL FLT pin as a low-level analog input. It is suggested that the ground end of\nthe PLL filter be returned directly to the AGND pin independently of the ground plane.Phase\nComparator\nand Charge Pump\n÷NVCORMCKINPUT\nCRIPCFLTRFLT\nFigure 23.  PLL Block Diagram\n54 DS578F3CS8416\n18.2.2 Capacitor Selection\nThe type of capacitors used for the PLL filter can have a significant ef fect on receiver performance. Large\nor exotic film capacitors are not nec essary as their leads and the required longer circuit board traces add\nundesirable inductance to the circuit. Surface mount ceramic capacitors are a good choice because their\nown inductance is low, and they can be mounted close to the FILT pin to minimize trace inductance. For\nCRIP, a C0G or NPO dielectric is recommended, and for CFLT, an X7R dielectric is preferred. Avoid ca-\npacitors with large temperature co-coefficient, or capac itors with high dielectric constants, that are sensi-\ntive to shock and vibration. These include the Z5U and Y5V dielectrics.\n18.2.3 Circuit Board Layout\nBoard layout and capacitor choice affect each ot her and determine the performance of the PLL. Figure 24\ncontains a suggested layout for the PLL filter components and for bypassing the analog supply voltage.The 0.1 µF bypass capacitor is  in a 1206 form factor. R\nFLT, CFLT, CRIP, and the 1000 pF decoupling ca-\npacitor are in an 0805 form factor. The traces are on th e top surface of the board with the IC so that there\nis no via inductance. The traces themselves are shor t to minimize the inductance in the filter path. The\nVA and AGND traces extend back to their origin and are shown only in truncated form in the drawing.\n18.2.4 Component Value Selection\nThe external PLL component values are listed in Table 6 .\nRange (kHz) RFLT CFLT CRIP Settling Time\n32 - 192 3 k Ω 22 nF 1 nF 4 ms\nTable 6.
