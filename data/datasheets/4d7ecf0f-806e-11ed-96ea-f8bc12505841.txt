F For more information www.analog.com Document FeedbackFEATURES\nAPPLICATIONSDESCRIPTION50mA, 3V to 80V  \nLow Dropout  \nMicropower Linear Regulator\nThe LT®3010 is a high voltage, micropower low dropout \nlinear regulator . The device is capable of supplying 50mA \noutput current with a dropout voltage of 300mV. Designed \nfor use in battery-powered or high voltage systems, the \nlow quiescent current (30µA operating and 1µA in shut -\ndown) makes the LT3010 an ideal choice. Quiescent cur -\nrent is also well controlled in dropout.\nOther features of the LT3010 include the ability to oper -\nate with very small output capacitors. The regulators \nare stable with only 1µF on the output while most older \ndevices require between 10µF and 100µF for stability. \nSmall ceramic capacitors can be used without the neces -\nsary addition of ESR as is common with other regula-\ntors. Internal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery \nprotection, current limiting, thermal limiting and reverse \ncurrent protection. \nThe device is available in a fixed output voltage of 5V and \nas an adjustable device with a 1.275V reference voltage. \nThe LT3010 regulator is available in the 8-lead MSOP \npackage with an exposed pad for enhanced thermal han -\ndling capability.n Wide Input Voltage Range: 3V to 80V\nn Low Quiescent Current: 30µA\nn Low Dropout Voltage: 300mV\nn Output Current: 50mA\nn Thermally Enhanced 8-Lead MSOP Package\nn No Protection Diodes Needed\nn Fixed Output Voltage: 5V (L T3010-5)\nn Adjustable Output from 1.275V to 60V (L T3010)\nn 1µA Quiescent Current in Shutdown\nn Stable with 1µF Output Capacitor\nn Stable with Aluminum, Tantalum or Ceramic \nCapacitors\nn Reverse-Battery Protection\nn No Reverse Current Flow from Output\nn Thermal Limiting\nn AEC-Q100 Qualified for Automotive Applications\nn Low Current High Voltage Regulators\nn Regulator for Battery-Powered Systems\nn Telecom Applications\nn Automotive Applications\n5V Supply with ShutdownDropout VoltageTYPICAL APPLICATION\nIN\nLT3010-5\nSHDN1µFVIN\n5.4V TO\n80VOUT\nSENSE\nGND\n30105 TA01VOUT\n5V\n50mA\nVSHDN  (PIN 5)\n<0.3V\n>2.0VOUTPUT\nOFF\nON1µF\nOUTPUT CURRENT (mA)0250300350\n40\n30105 TA02200\n150\n10 20 30 50100\n50\n0DROPOUT VOL TAGE (mV)All registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nLT3010/LT3010-5\n2\nRev.

The regulated output voltage specification will not apply \nfor all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. When \noperating at maximum input voltage, the output current range must be \nlimited. When operating at maximum output current, the input voltage \nrange must be limited.\nNote 4: To satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, the LT3010 \n(adjustable version) is tested and specified for these conditions with an \nexternal resistor divider (249k bottom, 392k top) for an output voltage of \n3.3V. The external resistor divider will add a 5µA DC load on the output.\nNote 5: Dropout voltage is the minimum input to output voltage differential \nneeded to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, the \noutput voltage will be equal to (V IN – V DROPOUT ).\nNote 6: GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT (nominal) and a current \nsource load. This means the device is tested while operating in its dropout region. This is the worst-case GND pin current. The GND pin current will \ndecrease slightly at higher input voltages.\nNote 7: ADJ pin bias current flows into the ADJ pin.\nNote 8: SHDN pin current flows out of the SHDN pin.\nNote 9: Reverse output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and the \nOUT pin forced to the rated output voltage. This current flows into the OUT \npin and out the GND pin.\nNote 10: The LT3010E is guaranteed to meet performance specifications \nfrom 0°C to 125°C operating junction temperature. Specifications over \nthe –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by \ndesign, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. \nThe LT3010H is tested to the LT3010H Electrical Characteristics table at \n140°C operating junction temperature. The LT3010MP is 100% tested and \nguaranteed over the –55°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. \nHigh junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes. Operating lifetime \nis derated at junction temperatures greater than 125°C.\nNote 11: This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction \ntemperature will exceed 125°C (LT3010E and LT3010MP) or 140°C \n(LT3010H) when overtemperature protection is active.

F For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS\nOUT (Pin 1): Output. The output supplies power to the \nload. A minimum output capacitor of 1µF is required to \nprevent oscillations. Larger output capacitors will be \nrequired for applications with large transient loads to limit \npeak voltage transients. See the Applications Information \nsection for more information on output capacitance and \nreverse output characteristics.\nSENSE (Pin 2): Sense. For the LT3010-5, the SENSE pin \nis the input to the error amplifier . Optimum regulation will \nbe obtained at the point where the SENSE pin is connected \nto the OUT pin of the regulator . In critical applications, \nsmall voltage drops are caused by the resistance (R P) \nof PC traces between the regulator and the load. These \nmay be eliminated by connecting the SENSE pin to the \noutput at the load as shown in Figure\xa01 (Kelvin Sense \nConnection). Note that the voltage drop across the exter -\nnal PC traces will add to the dropout voltage of the regu -\nlator . The SENSE pin bias current is 10µA at the nominal \nrated output voltage.\nADJ (Pin 2):  Adjust. For the adjustable LT3010, this is the \ninput to the error amplifier . This pin is internally clamped \nto ±7V. It has a bias current of 50nA which flows into the \npin (see curve of ADJ Pin Bias Current vs Temperature in the Typical Performance Characteristics). The ADJ pin \nvoltage is 1.275V referenced to ground, and the output \nvoltage range is 1.275V to 60V.\nNC (Pins 3, 6, 7): No Connection. May be floated, tied to \nIN or tied to GND.\nGND (Pin 4, Pin 9):  Ground. The exposed backside (pin 9) \nof the package is an electrical connection for GND. As \nsuch, to ensure optimum device operation, pin 9 must be \nconnected directly to pin 4 on the PC board.\nSHDN (Pin 5): Shutdown. The SHDN  pin is used to put \nthe LT3010 into a low power shutdown state. The output \nwill be off when the SHDN pin is pulled low. The SHDN \npin can be driven either by 5V logic or open-collector \nlogic with a pull-up resistor . The pull-up resistor is only \nrequired to supply the pull-up current of the open-collec -\ntor gate, normally several microamperes. If unused, the \nSHDN pin must be tied to a logic high or V IN.\nIN (Pin 8): Input. Power is supplied to the device through \nthe IN pin. A bypass capacitor is required on this pin if \nthe device is more than six inches away from the main \ninput filter capacitor . In general, the output impedance of \na battery rises with frequency, so it is advisable to include \na bypass capacitor in battery-powered circuits. A bypass \ncapacitor in the range of 1µF to 10µF is sufficient. The \nLT3010 is designed to withstand reverse voltages on the \nIN pin with respect to ground and the OUT pin. In the \ncase of a reversed input, which can happen if a battery is \nplugged in backwards, the LT3010 will act as if there is \na diode in series with its input. There will be no reverse \ncurrent flow into the LT3010 and no reverse voltage will \nappear at the load. The device will protect both itself and \nthe load.Figure\xa01.

F For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe LT3010 is a 50mA high voltage low dropout regulator \nwith micropower quiescent current and shutdown. The \ndevice is capable of supplying 50mA at a dropout voltage \nof 300mV. The low operating quiescent current (30µA) \ndrops to 1µA in shutdown. In addition to the low quies -\ncent current, the LT3010 incorporates several protection \nfeatures which make it ideal for use in battery-powered \nsystems. The device is protected against both reverse \ninput and reverse output voltages. In battery backup appli -\ncations where the output can be held up by a backup bat -\ntery when the input is pulled to ground, the LT3010 acts \nlike it has a diode in series with its output and prevents \nreverse current flow.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe adjustable version of the LT3010 has an output volt -\nage range of 1.275V to 60V. The output voltage is set by \nthe ratio of two external resistors as shown in Figure\xa02. \nThe device servos the output to maintain the voltage at \nthe adjust pin at 1.275V  referenced to ground. The current \nin R1 is then equal to 1.275V/R1 and the current in R2 is \nthe current in R1 plus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ \npin bias current, 50nA at 25°C, flows through R2 into the \nADJ pin. The output voltage can be calculated using the \nformula in Figure\xa02. The value of R1 should be less than \n250k to minimize errors in the output voltage caused by \nthe ADJ pin bias current. Note that in shutdown the output \nis turned off and the divider current will be zero.\nA small capacitor (C1) placed in parallel with the top resis -\ntor (R2) of the output divider is necessary for stability \nand transient performance of the adjustable LT3010. The \nimpedance of C1 at 10kHz should be less than the value \nof R1.\nFigure\xa02. Adjustable OperationThe adjustable device is tested and specified with the \nADJ pin tied to the OUT pin and a 5µA DC load (unless \notherwise specified) for an output voltage of 1.275V. \nSpecifications for output voltages greater than 1.275V will \nbe proportional to the ratio of the desired output voltage to \n1.275V;  (VOUT/1.275V). For example, load regulation for an  \noutput current change of 1mA to 50mA is – 10mV typical \nat VOUT = 1.275V. At V OUT = 12V, load regulation is:\n (12V/1.275V) • (– 10mV) = –94mV\nOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe LT3010 is designed to be stable with a wide range \nof output capacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor \naffects stability, most notably with small capacitors. A \nminimum output capacitor of 1µF with an ESR of 3Ω or \nless is recommended to prevent oscillations. The LT3010 \nis a micropower device and output transient response \nwill be a function of output capacitance. Larger values of \noutput capacitance decrease the peak deviations and pro -\nvide improved transient response for larger load current \nchanges. Bypass capacitors, used to decouple individual \ncomponents powered by the LT3010, will increase the \neffective output capacitor value.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a \nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across \ntemperature and applied voltage. The most common \ndielectrics used are specified with EIA temperature char -\nacteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V , X5R and X7R. The Z5U and \nY5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances \nin a small package, but they tend to have strong voltage \nand temperature coefficients as shown in Figure\xa03 and \nFigure\xa04. When used with a 5V regulator , a 16V 10µF Y5V \ncapacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1µF to \n2µF for the DC bias voltage applied and over the operating \ntemperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in \nmore stable characteristics and are more suitable for use \nas the output capacitor . The X7R type has better stability \nacross temperature, while the X5R is less expensive and \nis available in higher values. Care still must be exercised \nwhen using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R \ncodes only specify operating temperature range and maxi -\nmum capacitance change over temperature.

Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to \nimprove as component case size increases, but expected \ncapacitance at operating voltage should be verified.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, \nsimilar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro -\nphone works. For a ceramic capacitor the stress can be \ninduced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients.Thermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device will be lim -\nited by the maximum rated junction temperature (125°C,  \nLT3010E/LT3010MP or 140° C, LT3010H). The power dis -\nsipated by the device will be made up of two components:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage \ndifferential: I OUT • (VIN – VOUT) and,\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:  \nIGND • VIN\nThe GND pin current can be found by examining the \nGND Pin Current curves in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics. Power dissipation will be equal to the \nsum of the two components listed above.\nThe LT3010 series regulators have internal thermal \nlimiting designed to protect the device during overload \nconditions. For continuous normal conditions the maxi -\nmum junction temperature rating of 125° C (LT3010E/\nLT3010MP) or 140°C (LT3010H) must not be exceeded. \nIt is important to give careful consideration to all sources \nof thermal resistance from junction to ambient. Additional \nheat sources mounted nearby must also be considered.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board \nand its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated \nthrough-holes can also be used to spread the heat gener -\nated by power devices.\nThe following table lists thermal resistance for several \ndifferent board sizes and copper areas.

T ransient operation at high input/\noutput differentials is possible. The approximate thermal \ntime constant for a 2500sq mm 3/32" FR-4 board with \nmaximum topside and backside area for one ounce cop -\nper is 3 seconds. This time constant will increase as more \nthermal mass is added (i.e. vias, larger board, and other \ncomponents).\nFor an application with transient high power peaks, aver -\nage power dissipation can be used for junction tempera -\nture calculations as long as the pulse period is signifi -\ncantly less than the thermal time constant of the device \nand board.\nCalculating Junction Temperature\nExample 1: Given an output voltage of 5V, an input volt -\nage range of 24V to 30V, an output current range of 0mA \nto 50mA, and a maximum ambient temperature of 50°C, \nwhat will the maximum junction temperature be?\nThe power dissipated by the device will be equal to:\n IOUT(MAX)  • (V IN(MAX)  – V OUT) + (I GND • VIN(MAX) )\nwhere:\n IOUT(MAX)  = 50mA\n V IN(MAX)  = 30V\n IGND at (I OUT = 50mA, V IN = 30V) = 1mA\nSo:\n P = 50mA • (30V – 5V) + (1mA • 30V) = 1.28W\nThe thermal resistance will be in the range of 40°C/W to \n62°C/W depending on the copper area. So the junction \ntemperature rise above ambient will be approximately \nequal to:\n 1.31W • 50°C/W = 65.5°CThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal to \nthe maximum junction temperature rise above ambient \nplus the maximum ambient temperature or:\n T JMAX = 50°C + 65.5°C = 115.5°C\nExample 2:  Given an output voltage of 5V, an input voltage \nof 48V that rises to 72V for 5ms(max) out of every 100ms, \nand a 5mA load that steps to 50mA for 50ms out of every \n250ms, what is the junction temperature rise above ambi -\nent? Using a 500ms period (well under the time constant \nof the board), power dissipation is as follows:\n P1(48V in, 5mA load) = 5mA • (48V – 5V)  \n  + (200µA • 48V) = 0.23W\n P2(48V in, 50mA load) = 50mA • (48V – 5V)  \n  + (1mA • 48V) = 2.20W\n P3(72V in, 5mA load) = 5mA • (72V – 5V)  \n  + (200µA • 72V) = 0.35W\n P4(72V in, 50mA load) = 50mA • (72V – 5V)  \n  + (1mA • 72V) = 3.42W\nOperation at the different power levels is as follows:\n 76% operation at P1, 19% for P2, 4% for P3, and  \n 1% for P4.\n P EFF = 76%(0.23W) + 19%(2.20W) + 4%(0.35W)  \n + 1%(3.42W) = 0.64W\nWith a thermal resistance in the range of 40° C/W to  \n62°C/W , this translates to a junction temperature rise \nabove ambient of 26°C to 38°C.\nHigh Temperature Operation\nCare must be taken when designing LT3010H applications \nto operate at high ambient temperatures. The LT3010H \nworks at elevated temperatures but erratic operation can \noccur due to unforeseen variations in external compo -\nnents. Some tantalum capacitors are available for high \ntemperature operation, but ESR is often several ohms; \ncapacitor ESR above 3 Ω is unsuitable for use with the \nLT3010/LT3010-5\n12\nRev.

Ceramic capacitor manufacturers (Murata, \nAVX, TDK, and Vishay Vitramon at this writing) now offer \nceramic capacitors that are rated to 150°C using an X8R \ndielectric. Device instability will occur if output capacitor \nvalue and ESR are outside design limits at elevated tem -\nperature and operating DC voltage bias (see information \non capacitor characteristics under Output Capacitance \nand T ransient Response). Check each passive component \nfor absolute value and voltage ratings over the operating \ntemperature range.\nLeakages in capacitors or from solder flux left after insuf-\nficient board cleaning adversely affects low quiescent cur -\nrent operation. Consider junction temperature increase \ndue to power dissipation in both the junction and nearby \ncomponents to ensure maximum specifications are not \nviolated for the LT3010H or external components.\nProtection Features\nThe LT3010 incorporates several protection features \nwhich make it ideal for use in battery-powered circuits. \nIn addition to the normal protection features associated \nwith monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and \nthermal limiting, the device is protected against reverse-\ninput voltages, and reverse voltages from output to input.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nare intended to protect the device against current overload \nconditions at the output of the device. For normal opera -\ntion, the junction temperature should not exceed 125°C \n(LT3010E/LT3010MP) or 140°C (LT3010H).The input of the device will withstand reverse voltages of \n80V. Current flow into the device will be limited to less \nthan 6mA (typically less than 100µA) and no negative \nvoltage will appear at the output. The device will protect \nboth itself and the load. This provides protection against \nbatteries which can be plugged in backward.\nThe ADJ pin of the adjustable device can be pulled above \nor below ground by as much as 7V without damaging the \ndevice. If the input is left open circuit or grounded, the \nADJ pin will act like an open circuit when pulled below \nground, and like a large resistor (typically 100k) in series \nwith a diode when pulled above ground. If the input is \npowered by a voltage source, pulling the ADJ pin below \nthe reference voltage will cause the device to try and force \nthe current limit current out of the output. This will cause \nthe output to go to a unregulated high voltage. Pulling \nthe ADJ pin above the reference voltage will turn off all \noutput current.\nIn situations where the ADJ pin is connected to a resistor \ndivider that would pull the ADJ pin above its 7V clamp \nvoltage if the output is pulled high, the ADJ pin input \ncurrent must be limited to less than 5mA. For example, a \nresistor divider is used to provide a regulated 1.5V output \nfrom the 1.22V reference when the output is forced to \n60V. The top resistor of the resistor divider must be cho -\nsen to limit the current into the ADJ pin to less than 5mA  \nwhen the ADJ pin is at 7V. The 53V difference between \nthe OUT and ADJ pins divided by the 5mA maximum \ncurrent into the ADJ pin yields a minimum top resistor \nvalue of 10.6k.\nLT3010/LT3010-5\n13\nRev.

The output \nvoltage may be held up while the input is either pulled \nto ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage, or is left \nopen circuit. Current flow back into the output will follow \nthe curve shown in Figure\xa05. The rise in reverse output \ncurrent above 7V occurs from the breakdown of the 7V \nclamp on the ADJ pin. With a resistor divider on the regu -\nlator output, this current will be reduced depending on the \nsize of the resistor divider .When the IN pin of the LT3010 is forced below the OUT \npin or the OUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, input cur -\nrent will typically drop to less than 2µA. This can happen \nif the input of the LT3010 is connected to a discharged \n(low voltage) battery and the output is held up by either \na backup battery or a second regulator circuit. The state \nof the SHDN pin will have no effect on the reverse output \ncurrent when the output is pulled above the input.\nLT3010/LT3010-5\n14\nRev.
