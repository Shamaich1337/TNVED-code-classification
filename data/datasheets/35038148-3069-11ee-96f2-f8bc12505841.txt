It supports the \ninput voltage range of 2.5V to 18V, and can also \nprovide current up to 300mA under the condition of \ngood heat dissipation. The CJ6330 series has ultra-\nlow quiescent current and low dropout voltage, which \ncan provide large output current even when the input \nand output voltage difference is very small. These \nfeatures can help modern appliances meet \nincreasingly stringent energy requirements and help \nextend the battery life of portable power solutions.\nThe CJ6330 series provides a fixed voltage version \nwith multiple output voltage points for selection. The \nfixed voltage version does not need external resistors \nand can minimize the size of printed circuit board \n(PCB). The CJ6330 series also has a built-in current \nlimit and thermal shutdown, which helps to protect the \nregulator in the event of a load short circuit or fault.\n2    Available Packages\nNote: For all available packages, please refer to the part \nOrderable Information .\nPlease carefully read the notice at the end of this data sheet about product use, data sheet changes and important statements.3    Features\n•Input Voltage Range: 2.5V ~ 18V\n•Fixed Output Voltage Available from\n1.2V to 5.0V\n•Output Voltage Tolerance:\n±2% for Conventional Device\n±1% can be Customized\n•Output Current: up to 300mA\n•Low Quiescent Current: 2.0μA\n•Dropout Voltage:\n160mV@100mA (V OUT = 3.3V)\n•Power Supply Rejection Ratio:\n65dB@1kHz\n•Low Output Noise:\n27×V OUT μV RMS (10Hz ~ 100kHz)\n•Excellent Transient Response\n•Integrated Fault Protection:\n- Fold-back Current Limit\n- Thermal Shutdown\n-Short-Circuit Protection\n4    Applications\n•Always-on Power Supplies\n•Gaming Controllers, Remote\nControls,Toys, Drones\n•Portable and Battery-powered\nEquipment\n•Set-top Boxes\n•Ultrabooks, Tablets, E-readers\n•Wearable Electronics\n•Wireless Handsets and Smart Phones\nNormal \nDevice\n1µF 1µFVININVOUTOUT\nGNDWith Enable \nFuction\n1µFVININVOUTOUT\nGNDEN1µF\nTypical Application CircuitsPART NUMBER  PACKAGE  \nCJ6330 Series  SOT-23-3L \nSOT-89-3L \nSOT-223 \nSOT-23-5L \n5    Orderable Information\n2 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.2\nCJ6330 Series\nCJ6330Package type.\nA□M / A□MC / A□MY: SOT-23 -3L\nA□P / A □PT / A□PL: SOT-89 -3L\nA□G / A□GF: SOT-223\nB□M / A□MF / A□ MR: SOT- 23-5L\nDevice serial number.\nEnable function marking.\nA: Normal device, no enable function\nB: With enable function\nOutput voltage.\n12: Fixed output 1.2V\n15: Fixed output 1.5V\n18: Fixed output 1.8V\n25: Fixed output 2.5V\n28: Fixed output 2.8V\n30: Fixed output 3.0V\n33: Fixed output 3.3V\n36: Fixed output 3.6V\n50: Fixed output 5.0V\nFigure 5-1.

The internal regulator tube (PMOS) will control its conduction degree through the grid \nvoltage provided by the error amplifier output, which will make the output voltage V OUT not affected by temperature \nchanges or input voltage changes to a certain extent, thus maintaining the stability of the device output voltage.8.1  Description\nThe CJ6330 series is a group of 18V, low-power consumption, low-dropout linear regulators (LDO). The CJ6330 \nseries supports fixed voltage output from 1.2V to 5.0V, which enables it to use fewer external com ponents to \nprovide better accuracy. \nThe CJ6330 series has low I Q performance and is internally integrated with current limiting, \nshort-circuit protection and thermal shutdown protection, which makes it an ideal choice for battery power or line \npower applications.\n8.2  Functional Block Diagram\nCJ6330 Series\n18 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.28    Detailed Description\n8.3  Feature Description\nPower Supply Input\nWhen the input voltage is lower than the rated range of the data sheet, the device will lose the regulation function of \nstabilizing the output voltage, that is, it is \nunable to maintain the output voltage within the rated range. At this time, \ncompared with normal operation, the quiescent current of the device may exceed the rated range, and the transient \nresponse performance may be seriously degraded. \nWhen the input voltage is higher \nthan the rated \nrange of the data sheet, the device may cause irreversible damage \nor failure due to exceeding the maximum rated range of electrical stress. \nFor the rated input voltage of the device, see Recommended Operating Conditions and Dropout Voltage.\nOutput Current\nWhen the circuit design is appropriate, the CJ6330 series can reach the maximum load capacity of at least 300mA. \nAccording to the power dissipation of the package and \nthe effective connection thermal resistance with the \nenvironment, selecting the appropriate package for the circuit design can make the device emit more heat energy. \nBuilt-in Current Limit & Short Circuit Protection\nThe CJ6330 series has an internal current limiting circuit, which can protect the device by limiting the load current \nvalue in case of instantaneous high load c\nurrent. When the current limiting is triggered, the output voltage is not \nregulated. \nIf the out pin of the regulator is short circuited, the internal current limiting circuit will be triggered, the \noutput current of the device will maintain at a \nrelatively small value to protect the device. The typical value of short \ncurrent I Short can be found in Electrical Characteristics. The current limiting state will continue until the load current \ndrops to the normal range. \nWhen the load current of \nthe device is large, the device will generate more heat due to the increase of power \nconsumption, which may cause the device to turn off its output due to the internal thermal shutdown protection \nbefore the current limit is triggered.\nIn order to ensure the normal \noperation of current limit, the inductance of input and load shall be minimized. \nContinuous operation under current limit is not recommended. \nThe current limit mode of the CJ6330 series \nis fold-back current limit. Please refer to the Fold-back Current Limit for \nmore details.\nThermal Shutdown\nThe CJ6330 series has thermal shutdown protection mechanism. When the junction temperature (T J) of the internal \nmain channel MOSFET exceeds the \nthermal shutdown threshold temperature (T SD), thermal shutdown will be \ntriggered. \nAt this time, the output will be turned off to prevent catastrophic damage to the chip due to accidental \nheating. When the T J drops to a certain range \nof thermal shutdown threshold temperature (ΔT SD), the thermal \nshutdown will be released and the device will \nreturn to the normal output. The temperature threshold of device \ntriggering thermal shutdown (T SD) and temperature range to be lowered to released from thermal shutdown (ΔT SD) \ncan be found in the Electrical Characteristics.\nTo ensure reliable operation,\n please limit the junction \ntemperature to the specified range of Recommended \nOperating Conditions  in the data sheet. Applications that exceed the recommended temperature range may cause \nthe device to exceed its operating specifications. \nAlthough the internal protection circuit of \nthe devic\ne is designed to prevent overall thermal conditions, it is not \nintended to replace proper power dissipation. Running the \ndevice continuously until thermal shutdown or higher \nthan the recommended operating T J will reduce long-term reliability.\nCJ6330 Series\n19 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.28    Detailed Description\n8.3  Feature Description (continued)\nDropout Voltage\nDropout voltage (V DO) refers to the minimum voltage difference between input and output (V IN - V OUT) to make the \ndevice output voltage \nreach the rated range at rated current. When the dropout voltage condition required by the \ndevice is reached, the internal MOSFET will \nbe fully turned on, at this time, the MOSFET is equivalent to a switch \nfor regulation.\nThe V DO increases with the increase of load \ncurrent. Since V IN - V OUT must be no less than the V DO, the V DO \nindirectly specifies the minimum input \nvoltage of devices under different load current conditions. If the V IN - V OUT is \nless than the V DO, the performance of the device may deteriorate (see Operation in Dropout Mode for details).\nEnable Control\nThe enable pin of the device (EN)  is active at high level. When the voltage of the EN is greater than the EN logic \nhigh voltage (V EN H), the device will be \nenabled and maintain the normal output. When the voltage of the EN is \nlower than the EN logic low voltage (V EN L), the internal circuit of the device will be disabled and the output will be \nturned off, the device, the device will be in the standby mode until EN is turned to high level again. The V EN H and \nVEN L can be found in the Electrical Characteristics.\nNormal startup waveform and startup \nslope rate control can be ensured when the device starts from any low \nvoltage lower than V EN L, but the discharge \ntime of output capacitor must be taken into account. EN can not be float, \nif EN is not required to control the output voltage independently, connect EN to IN.\nAuto-discharge Function\nThe device with enable control has an auto-discharge circuit. When the enable control is turned off, the device will \nbe disabled. An internally integrated pull-down \nMOSFET (see Functional Block Diagram) will connect a resistor \n(RDischarge ) to the ground to release the charge \nin the output capacitor, thus closing the entire device circuit. The \nvalue of R Discharge  can be found in the Electrical Characteristics\n. The discharge time of the output capacitor after the \ndevice is disabled is determined by the output \ncapacitance (C OUT) and load resistance (R L) in parallel with the \nRDischarge . The time constant τ can be calculated by the following formula: \nThe output voltage after discharging through pull-down MOSFET can be calculated by the follow\ning formula:\nWhere, V is the output voltage after discharge, VOUT is \nthe output voltage, t is the discharge time, τ is the discharge \ntime constant. \nDo not \nrely on \nthe active discharge circuit to release a large amount of output capacitance after the input power \nsupply crashes, because the reverse current can flow from the output to the input. This reverse current may \ndamage the device. The limiting reverse current shall not exceed 5% of the rated current of the device.τ= C ×𝐿𝐿𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎   (𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿= 0) \n𝜏𝜏=𝐶𝐶×�𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿×𝐿𝐿𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎\n𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝐿𝐿𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 � (𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿≠0) \n𝑉𝑉=𝑉𝑉𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 ×𝑒𝑒−𝑡𝑡\nτ\n𝑡𝑡=τ×ln( 𝑉𝑉\n𝑉𝑉𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 ) \nCJ6330 Series\n9    Application and Implementation\n9.1  Typical Application Circuits\n9.2  Applicat ion Information\nSelection of Bypass Capacitances\nFor the CJ6330 series, it is recommended to use 1μF input (C IN) and output (C OUT) ceramic capacitors.\nType of Capacitors: \nSince any leakage of the capacitor will increase the quiescent power consumption of the whole circuit, attention \nshould be paid to selecting capacitors with low leakage. When designing the circuit of portable equipment including \nCJ6330 series, due to the shortage of tantalum capacitors, it is a good choice to use small size, low equivalent \nseries resistance (ESR) and high RMS current capacity multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) in the DC to DC \nvoltage conversion. The designer must choose the appropriate capacitor type for circuit design: X7R- Ceramic \ncapacitors of X5R- and COG- rated dielectric materials can provide relatively good capacitance stability within the \ntemperature range, Y5V- type capacitors are not recommended because of large changes in capacitance values. \nHowever, no matter which type of ceramic capacitor is selected, \nthe effective capacitance may vary with the \noperating voltage and temperature. The designer must consider the influence of the change of the effective value \nof capacitance according to the circuit design and application conditions.\nInput Capacitors (C IN):\nIt is recommended to use a 1μF capacitor at \nthe input pin of the device, and the position of the input capacitor \nshould be as close to the device input pin as possible.\nFor the CJ6330 series, the input capacitor is not necessary to maintain the output stability, but it can offset the \nreactive input source and improve the transient response, input ripple and PSRR performance of the device. \nIt should be noted that \nalthough many types of capacitors \ncan be used for input bypass, using ceramic capacitors \nfor input filtering may cause problems. Due to the self resonance and high Q characteristics of some types of \nceramic capacitors, under certain starting conditions, applying voltage steps to ceramic capacitors may lead to \nlarge current surges (such as directly connecting the input \npin of LDO to the power supply), which may cause some \nenergy stored in the parasitic inductance of the power \nlead. When the stored energy is transferred from these \ninductors to ceramic capacitors, large voltage spikes may occur in the circuit. These voltage spikes are easily twice \nthe step amplitude of the input voltage, and are likely \nto bring potential risks to the normal operation and reliability \nof the device. Therefore, the selection of ceramic capacitors as \ninput capacitors must be careful. Adding 3Ω \nresistors and X5R- type ceramic capacitors will minimize voltage transients during startup. A higher value capacitor \nmay be necessary if large, fast rise-time load or line transients are anticipated or if the device is located several \ninches from the input power source. \n21 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.2With Enable \nFunctionNormal DeviceIN\nGNDOUT\nENVIN VOUT OUT IN VOUT VIN\nCIN\n1µF\nor moreCOUT\n1µF\nor moreCIN\n1µF\nor moreCOUT\n1µF\nor more\nGND\nCJ6330 Series\n21 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.29    Application and Implementation\n9.2  Application Information (continued)\nSelection of Bypass Capacitances (continued)\nOutput Capacitors (C OUT):\nRecommended 1μF output ceramic capacitor to keep the device output stable, and the capacitor position should be \nas close to the device pin as possible. \nFor CJ6330 series, the device\n needs an output capacitor to achieve loop stability. As with any regulator, a larger \noutput capacitance reduces the peaks during a load transient but slows down the response time of the device. The \nproper capacitor can help to obtain better dynamic performance. \nTransient Response\nTransient response refers to the change of system output from initial state to stable state under the action of typical \nsignal input. For LDO, the designer should \npay attention to the possible impact of linear transient response and \nload transient response on the system: linear transient response refers to the transient response of output to \nchange when \nthe input voltage changes, \nwhile load transient response refers to the transient response of output to \nchange when the output current changes. The \nspecific phenomenon is that the output voltage of the device will \nhave a short spike, especially when \nthe input voltage or output current changes greatly in a short time. This change \nis not only related to the performance \nof the chip itself, but also related to the change of output current, change rate \nand output capacitance:\n1. When the output current increases, the output voltage of the device will decrease to a certain extent, and the\nlarger output current will provide a higher current discharge path for the output capacitor, which will affect the\npeak value generated by the transient spik\ne and reduce the peak value;\n2. The output current or input voltage changes relatively slowly, and the output change of the device is relatively\nsmall, affecting the spike caused by the change;\n3. The use of large input and output capacitors can reduce the spike caused by transient response to a certain\nextent to improve the transient perform\nance, but large output capacitors can also affect the response time of\ndevices.\nFor the selection of bypass capacitance value, refer to the Section of B\nypass Capacitances selection.\nOperation in Dropout Mode\nThe CJ6330 series is internally integrated with a P-MOSFET to achieve low dropout voltage. The voltage difference \nbetween the input and the output (V IN - V OUT) of the device must not be lower than the corresponding dropout \nvoltage (V DO) to ensure that the output voltage tolerance is within the rated range of the data sheet. The dropout \nvoltage will increase with the increase of \nload current. When the V IN - V OUT is less than the V DO, the P-MOSFET \ninside the device is in a linear state, the resistance from the input pin to the output pin is equal to the resistance \nfrom the drain to the source of the P-MOSFET, and the device functions like a resistor. When operating in this \nstate, the response time of the error \namplifier inside the device will be limited, which will seriously degrade the \ntransient performance of the device, when \nthe external circuit has a transient change, the deviation of the output \nvoltage will become larger than the \nnormal operating state. In addition, the PSRR and noise performance of the \ndevice will be worse than that under normal operating conditions.\nCJ6330 Series\n22 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.29    Application and Implementation\n9.2  Application Information (continued)\nFold-back Current Limit\nThe CJ6330 series adopts the fold-back current limit. The following is some application information of the fold-back \ncurrent limit.\nCurrent Limit Type: \nCurrent limit can impose certain restrictions on \nthe current value provided by the device. Compared with the so-\ncalled "brick-wall" current limiting mode, the significant difference \nof the fold-back current limit is that overload and \nshort circuit are obviously different. Figure 9-1 and Figure 9-2 \nshow the typical operating characteristics of these \ntwo current limiting mechanisms. \n1. Operating characteristic curve R1 represents the curve of linear resistance as load under normal working\ncondition;\n2. When the linear resistance as the load gradually decreases and causes the device to enter the overload state,\nthe operating characteristic curve is shown in R2;\n3. When the linear resistance decreases to 0Ω, the device will enter the s\nhort-circuit state, and the operating\ncharacteristic curve is shown in R3.\nFigure 9-1. Fold-back Current Limit Figure 9-2. Brick-wall Current LimitVOUT  Nor\n0 IShort IRated ILimitR1\nR2\nR3R1\nR2\nR3\nIRated ILimitVOUT  Nor\n0Constant\nOverload OverloadConstant\nAfter entering the short circuit state, the short-circuit current of the "brick-wall"  type current  limiting mechanism \nis limited \nto I Limit, \nand the reliability and stability of the voltage regulator may be affected due to the  large amount \nof heat  generated  during the short circuit, while the IShort of fold-back current limit  in the short circuit state is  far \nlower than I Limit, which \ncan reduce the heat energy generated due to power  dissipation during the device short \ncircuit. The fold-back current limit allows the\n device to limit the short circuit current to a small current value \nwithout \nlosing the \nrated range of output\n current. This is very important if continuous  short circuit faults need to be \nsolved. \nThe current limiting mechan\nism limits the maximum load current of the device, and the internal transmission \ntransistor of the device will not move\n outside its safe operation area (SOA) during operation. \nSee Recommended Continuous\n Operating Areas  for details.\nCJ6330 Series\n23 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.29    Application and Implementation\nUsage and Precautions:\nWhen using the voltage regulator with the fold-back current limit, it should be noted that the device cannot be \nstarted normally under certain loads because the \nshort-circuit current of the fold-back current limit is obviously \ndifferent from the maximum load current. As shown in the curves S1 and S2 in Figure 9-3, the nonlinear load S1 is \ndistributed in the range of the load cur\nve region where \nthe device can work, because the current provided by the \ndevice is always greater than the requirements of the load under all voltage conditions, \nthe device can start \nnormally, and the output will reach the ideal operating point P1; The situation of nonlinear load S2 is different, \nduring actual startup, when the voltage and cur\nrent are gradually rising, the \noutput of S2 will be limited at P2, \nbecause the device cannot provide \nmore current under the voltage at P2, which will make \nthe output stuck at the \nintersection and maintain at this level, and the device cannot reach the ideal operating point P 3 for normal startup. \nS1 S2\nP1\nP2P3\nIShort IRated ILimitVOUT  Nor\nP1\'\nP2\'L1 P3\' L2\nIShort IRated ILimitVOUT  Nor\n0 0\nFigure 9-3. Nonlinear Load Example Figure 9-4. Active Load Profile\nIn addition, many typical cases of actual loads have operating characteristics as shown in L1 and L2 curves \nin Figure 9-4. When the device starts from zero with L1 and L2 as loads, the load will behave as a linear \nresistance, and\n the load current will change to a constant value after \nreaching the inflection point voltage. Like \nnonlinear loads S1 and S2\n, when L1 is used as the load, the device c\nan start normally and reach the ideal \nworking point P1\', while when L2 is used as the load, the device cannot start normally, and the output will be stuck \nat P2\' and cannot reach the id\neal working point P 3\'. \nAs an active load, the electronic load has the same operating characteristic s as L1 and L2. Some \nproblems may occur when using the electronic load to test the voltage regulator with a fold-back current limit. \nSee Test Current Limit for more details.\nFor the load with specific operating characteristics as s\nhown in S2 and L2\n curves, it is necessary to use a fold-\nback current limiting device with a higher IShort, or a voltage stabilizing device with a "brick-wall" \ntype \ncurrent limiting.9.2  Application Information (continued)\nFold-back Current Limit (continued)\nCJ6330 Series\n24 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.29    Application and Implementation\n9.2  Application Information (continued)\nTest Current Limit\nThe CJ6330 series uses the fold-back current limit. When testing this kind of linear voltage regulator with the fold-\nback current limit, it should be noted \nthat using the electronic load that is very common in the laboratory as the load \nof the voltage regulator may cause some problems:\n1. When the constant current mode (CC) is used for testing, when the load current is higher than the short circuit\ncurrent (I Short), the device may not be able to start norm\nally from 0V, because the CC mode of the electronic\nload has similar operating characteristics as the L2 curve described in the fold-back current limit. Moreover, in\nthe CC mode, the internal circuit of the electronic load will try to pull down the output voltage below the\nground.\n A feasible method is to start the device with no load first, and then switch to the required steady state\ncurrent. A constant resistance (CR) load mode using an electronic load may help, but this may lead to the\nfollowin\ng other problems.\n2. When using the CC mode of the electronic load to test the current limiting behavior, the negative feedback\nloop with constant internal control current of the electronic load will c\nonflict with the current limiting loop of the\ndevice and may cause faults. When the CR mode is used for testing, the complex control loop inside the\nelectronic load that keeps the load resistance constant will interact with the regulator and may oscillate at the\noutput.\nThe above are \nsome problems that \nmay occur when using electronic load to test the voltage regulator. Using actual \nresistance as the load is a good\n solution. When testing the I Limit, the variable resistor can be used as the load. First, \nset the resistance value of the variable resistor to be large enough so that the output current of the device under \ntest at this time is significantly less \nthan the current at full load, then gradually reduce the load resistance until the \noutput voltage exceeds the specified range, and the load current at this time is the maximum load current. The \nspecified range of output voltage depends on \nthe range that the user thinks can be accepted and the current \nregulation rate of the voltage regulato\nr. When some voltage regulators are in the fold-back current limit state, the \noutput voltage drops rapidly. For these devices, \nthe load current before the output voltage drops should be \nconsidered as the maximum load current. The measurement of short circuit current can be realized by shorting the \noutput or connecting the load resistance of 0Ω. \nCompared with the electronic load, \nthe variable resistor may not be so convenient, but the use of variable resistor \nfor current limiting measurement is the \nonly way to ensure that there is no bad interaction between the load and the \nvoltage regulator. If it is necessary \nto measure the starting characteristics of the device, a variable resistor must be \nused.\nRecommended Continuous Operating Areas\nAs an LDO, the working area of CJ6330 series is limited by dropout voltage, output current, junction temperature \nand input \nvoltage under continuous working condition. The recommended areas for continuous operation are \nshown in Figure 9-5: \nA. The LDO input and output voltage difference V IN - V OUT must meet the dropout voltage V DO conditions. See\nDropout Voltage for more details.\nB. Rated output current range I Rated.\nC. The actual junction temperature T J of LDO shall not exceed the rated junction temperature. The pr\noduct of\nvoltage difference and current at both ends of LDO is power consumption, which determines the actual\nworking junction temperature of LDO, so the curve is not linear.\nIn addition, the working area of CJ6330 series is limited by the rated V IN MIN and V IN MAX .\nCJ6330 Series\n25 www.jscj-elec.com Rev. - 2.29    Application and Implementation\n9.2  Application Information (continued)\nRecommended Continuous Work Areas (continued)\nFigure 9-5.

The input \npower supply should be well adjusted and have low noise. If the input power supply has high noise, it is \nrecommended to use an additional bypass capacitor at the input to improve the output noise performance of the \ndevice. It is recommended to use an input capacitor of 1µF or higher to reduce the impedance of the input power \nsupply, especially during transients.\n9.4  Layout Guidelines\nWhen designing the circuit including CJ6330 series, the following matters should be noted:\n•Place the input and output capacitors as close to the pins of the device as possible;\n•The device is connected by copper plane and the heat sink (or back pad) of the device is fully welded with\nPCB to obtain better heat dissipation performance and lower on resistance;\n•Heat sink holes are placed around the device to help the circuit dissipate more heat energy. However,\nattention should be paid to the position of the heat sink holes to prevent the solder (or solder paste) on the IC\npad from being absorbed by the heat sink holes and being damaged during welding.\nNOTE\nThe application information in this section is not part of the data sheet component specification, and JSCJ \nmakes no commitment or statement to guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Customers are \nresponsible for determining the rationality \nof corresponding components in their circuit design and making tests \nand verifications to ensure the normal r\nealization of their circuit design.Output Current Limited \nby Dropout\nA B C\nLimited by V IN MIN Limited by V IN MAXOutput Current\nVIN – V OUTRated Output Current Output Current Limited by Thermals\nCJ6330 Series\n10    Mechanical Information\n10.1  SOT-23-3L Mechanical Information \nSOT-23-3L Outline Dimension\nSymbol  Dimensions In Millimeters  Dimensions In Inches  \nMin.
