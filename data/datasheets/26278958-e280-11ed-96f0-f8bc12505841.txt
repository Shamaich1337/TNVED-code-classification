It features the high-est available output current while using smallcapacitors (Table 1). The three versions available differin their switching frequencies (f\nOSC)—MAX889R/\nMAX889S/MAX889T with f OSC = 500kHz/1MHz/2MHz,\nrespectively. Higher frequencies allow the use of small-er components (Table 1). Even smaller capacitor valuesthan those listed in Table 1 are suitable when thedevices are loaded at less than their rated output cur-rent. Designed specifically for compact applications, acomplete regulating circuit requires only three smallcapacitors and two resistors, Figure 1. In addition, theMAX889 includes soft-start, shutdown control, short-cir-cuit, and thermal protection.\nThe oscillator, control circuitry, and four power MOSFET\nswitches are included on-chip. The charge pump runscontinuously at the operating frequency. During one-halfof the oscillator period, switches S1 and S2 close(Figure 2), charging the transfer capacitor (C\nFLY) to the\ninput voltage (CAP- = GND, CAP+ = IN). During theother half cycle, switches S3 and S4 close (Figure 3),transferring the charge on C\nFLYto the output capacitor\n(CAP+ = GND, CAP- = OUT).\nVoltage Regulation\nVoltage regulation is achieved by controlling the flying-capacitor charging rate. The MAX889 controls thecharge on C\nFLYby modulating the gate drive to S1\n(Figure 2) to supply the charge necessary to maintainoutput regulation. When the output voltage droops,C\nFLYcharges higher due to increased gate drive. Sincethe device switches continuously, the regulation\nscheme minimizes output ripple, and the output noisespectrum contains well-defined frequency components.Feedback voltage is sensed with a resistor-dividerbetween an externally supplied positive reference orthe supply voltage and the negative inverted output.The feedback loop servos FB to GND. The effectiveoutput impedance in regulation is 0.05 Ω. The output\nremains in regulation until dropout is reached. Dropoutdepends on the output voltage setting and load current(see Output Voltage vs. Load Current in Typical\nOperating Characteristics ).\nFree-Run Mode \n(Unregulated Voltage Inverter)\nThe MAX889 may be used in an unregulated voltage\ninverter mode that does not require external feedbackresistors, minimizing board space. Connecting FB to INplaces the MAX889 in free-run mode. In this mode, thecharge pump operates to invert directly the input sup-ply voltage (V\nOUT = -(V IN- IOUT x RO)). Output resis-\ntance is typically 2 Ωand can be approximated by the\nfollowing equation:\nRO≅[1 / (f OSC x CFLY) ] + 2R SW+ \n4ESR CFLY + ESR COUT\nThe first term is the effective resistance of an ideal\nswitched-capacitor circuit (Figures 2 and 3), and R SW\nis the sum of the charge pump ’s internal switch resis-\ntances (typically 0.8 Ωat VIN= 5V). The last two terms\ntake into consideration the equivalent series resistance\nMAX889(ESR) of the flying and output capacitors. The typical\noutput impedance is more accurately determined fromthe Typical Operating Characteristics .\nCurrent Limit and Soft-Start\nThe MAX889 features a foldback current-limit/soft-start\nscheme that allows it to limit inrush currents duringstartup, overload, and output short-circuit conditions.Additionally, it permits a safe, timed recovery from faultconditions. This protects the MAX889 and preventslow-current or higher output impedance input supplies(such as alkaline cells) from being overloaded at start-up or short-circuit conditions. \nThe MAX889 features two current-limit/soft-start levels\nwith corresponding response to rising and falling out-put voltage thresholds of -0.6V and -1.5V. When thefalling output voltage crosses -1.5V, such as during anoverload condition, the input current is immediately lim-ited to 400mA by weakening the charge-pump switch-es. When the falling output voltage crosses -0.6V, suchas during a short-circuit condition, the MAX889 furtherweakens the charge-pump switches, immediately limit-ing input current to 200mA.\nDuring startup or short-circuit recovery, the MAX889\nlimits input current to 200mA with charge-pump switch-es at their weakest level. Rising output voltage crossing-0.6V initiates a 2ms timer, after which the MAX889increases switch strength to the next level. The risingoutput voltage crossing -1.5V initiates a 2ms timer, afterwhich the MAX889 provides full-strength operation. \nShutdown \nWhen SHDN (a CMOS-compatible input) is driven low,\nthe MAX889 enters 0.1µA shutdown mode. Charge-pump switching halts. Connect SHDN to IN or drive\nhigh for normal operation.  \nThermal Shutdown\nThe MAX889 features thermal shutdown with hysteresisfor added protection against fault conditions. When thedie temperature exceeds 160 °C, the internal oscillator\nstops, suspending device operation. The MAX889resumes operation when the die temperature falls 15 °C.\nThis prevents the device from rapidly oscillating aroundthe temperature trip point. \nApplications Information\nResistor Selection \n(Setting the Output Voltage)\nThe accuracy of V OUT depends on the accuracy of the\nvoltage biasing R1 in Figure 1. Use a separate refer-ence voltage if greater accuracy than provided by V\nIN\nis desired (Figure 4). Keep the feedback node as smallas possible, with resistors mounted close to the FB pin.

Table 1 providessuggested values for C\nIN, CFLY, and C OUT.\nSurface-mount ceramic capacitors are preferred for\nCIN, COUT, and C FLYdue to their small size, low cost,\nand low ESR. To ensure proper operation over theentire temperature range, choose ceramic capacitorswith X7R (or equivalent) low-temperature-coefficient(tempco) dielectrics. See Table 2 for a list of suggestedcapacitor suppliers.\nThe output capacitor stores the charge transferred from\nthe flying capacitor and services the load betweenoscillator cycles. A good general rule is to make theoutput capacitance at least five-times greater than theflying capacitor.\nOutput voltage ripple is largely dependent on C\nOUT.\nChoosing a low-ESR capacitor of sufficient value is impor-tant in minimizing the peak-to-peak output voltage ripple,which is approximated by the following equation:\nwhere C\nOUT is the output capacitor value, ESR COUT is\nthe output capacitor ’s ESR, and f OSC is the MAX889\nswitching frequency. Ceramic capacitors have the lowestESR and are recommended for C\nOUT. Where larger\ncapacitance at low cost is desired, a low-ESR tantalumcapacitor may be used for C\nOUT. See Table 2 for a list of\nsuggested capacitor suppliers.\nTo ensure stability over the entire operating temperature\nrange, choose a low-ESR output capacitor using the fol-lowing equation:where C\nOUTis the output capacitor value, and f MINis the\nminimum oscillator frequency in the Electrical\nCharacteristics table.\nTo ensure stability for regulated output mode, suitable\noutput capacitor ESR should be determined by the follow-ing equation:\nPower Dissipation\nThe power dissipated in the MAX889 depends on theinput voltage, output voltage, and output current. Devicepower dissipation is accurately described by:\nP\nDISS = IOUT(VIN- (-VOUT)) + (I Q✕VIN)\nwhere I Qis the device quiescent current. P DISS must be\nless than the package dissipation rating (see Absolute\nMaximum Ratings ). Pay particular attention to power dis-\nsipation limits when generating small negative voltagesfrom large positive input voltages. \nLayout Considerations\nThe MAX889 ’s high oscillator frequencies demand\ngood layout techniques that ensure stability and helpmaintain the output voltage under heavy loads. Takethe following steps to ensure optimum layout:\n1) Mount all components as close together as possible.2) Place the feedback resistors R1 and R2 close to the \nFB pin, and minimize the PC trace length at the FB circuit node.\n3) Keep traces short to minimize parasitic inductance \nand capacitance.\n4) Use a ground plane with C\nINand C OUTplaced in a \nstar ground configuration (see the MAX889SEVKIT layout).R  19.2 x 10\nI  R2\nR1ESR-3\nOUT≤\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8f7+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 1  C  15.5\nfR1\nR1 +  R2I OUT\nMIN OUT ≥\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 \nV =  I\n2 x f  C  \n2 x I  ESRRIPPLEOUT\nOSC OUT\nOUT COUT+\nMAX889High-Frequency, Regulated, \n200mA, Inverting Charge Pump\nMaxim cannot assume responsibility for use of any circuitry other than circuitry entirely embodied in a Maxim product.
