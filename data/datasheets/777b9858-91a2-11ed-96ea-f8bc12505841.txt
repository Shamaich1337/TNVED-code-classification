Unlike analog ICs using conventional CMOS processes, iCMOS \ncomponents can tolerate high supply voltages while providing \nincreased performance, dramatically lower power consumption, \nand reduced package size. \nThe on-resistance profile is very flat over the full analog input \nrange, ensuring excellent linearity and low distortion when switching signals.  \niCMOS construction ensures ultralow power dissipation, \nmaking the devices ideally suited for portable and battery-\npowered instruments. \nThe ADG1411 /ADG1412 /ADG1413  contain four independent \nsingle-pole/single-throw (SPST) switches. The ADG1411  and ADG1412  differ only in that the digital control logic is inverted. \nThe ADG1411  switches are turned on with Logic 0 on the \nappropriate control input, whereas the ADG1412  switches are \nturned on with Logic 1. The ADG1413  has two switches with \ndigital control logic similar to that of the ADG1411 ; the logic is \ninverted on the other two switches. Each switch conducts equally well in both directions when on  and has an input signal range \nthat extends to the supplies. In the off condition, signal levels up \nto the supplies are blocked.  \nThe ADG1413  exhibits break-before-make switching action for \nuse in multiplexer applications. Inherent in the design is low charge injection, which results in minimum transients when the \ndigital inputs are switched. \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. 2.6 Ω maximum on resistance over temperature. \n2. Minimum distortion. \n3. Ultralow power dissipation: <0.03 μW . \n4. 16-lead TSSOP and 16-lead, 4 mm × 4 mm LFCSP . \n \nADG1411/ADG1412/ADG1413  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.
