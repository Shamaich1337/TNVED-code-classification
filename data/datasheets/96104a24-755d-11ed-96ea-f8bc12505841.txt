Intended for medium power \napplications, it operates from a 2.25V to 5.5V input volt-age range and has a constant programmable switching frequency, allowing the use of tiny, low cost capacitors and inductors 2mm or less in height. Each output voltage is adjustable from 0.8V to 5V . Internal, synchronous, low R\nDS(ON)  power switches provide high efficiency without \nthe need for external Schottky diodes.\nA user selectable mode input allows the user to trade \noff ripple voltage for light load efficiency. Burst Mode® \noperation provides high efficiency at light loads, while Pulse Skip mode provides low ripple noise at light loads. A phase mode pin allows the second channel to operate in-phase or 180° out-of-phase with respect to channel 1. Out-of-phase operation produces lower RMS current on V\nIN \nand thus a lower RMS derating on the input capacitor.\nTo further maximize battery life, the P-channel MOSFETs \nare turned on continuously in dropout (100% duty cycle) and both channels draw a total quiescent current of only 125µA. In shutdown, the device draws <1µA.\nOUT2 Efficiency\n(Burst Mode Operation)n High Efficiency: Up to 95%\nn 1.5A/1A Guaranteed Minimum Output Current\nn Synchronizable to External Clock\nn No Schottky Diodes Required\nn Programmable Frequency Operation: 1.5MHz or   \nAdjustable From 0.6MHz to 4MHz\nn Low R DS(ON)  Internal Switches\nn Short-Circuit Protected\nn VIN: 2.25V to 5.5V\nn Current Mode Operation for Excellent Line and Load   \nT ransient Response\nn 125µA Quiescent Current in Sleep Mode\nn Ultralow Shutdown Current: I Q < 1µA\nn Low Dropout Operation: 100% Duty Cycle\nn Power Good Output\nn Phase Pin Selects 2nd Channel Phase Relationship   \nwith Respect to 1st Channel\nn Internal Soft-Start with Individual Run Pin Control\nn Available in Small Thermally Enhanced  \n(5mm × 3mm) DFN and 20-Lead TSSOP Packages\nn GPS/Navigation\nn Digital Cameras\nn PC Cards\nn Wireless and DSL Modems\nn General Purpose Point of Load DC/DCL, L T , L TC, L TM and Burst Mode are registered trademarks and Hot Swap and ThinSOT are \ntrademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.

Both channels share the same clock frequency. The PHASE pin sets whether the channels are running in-phase or out of phase. The operating frequency is de-termined by connecting the FREQ pin to V\nIN for 1.5MHz \noperation or by connecting a resistor from FREQ to ground for a frequency from 0.6MHz to 4MHz. To suit a variety of applications, the SYNC/MODE pin allows the user to trade off noise for efficiency.\nThe output voltages are set by external dividers returned \nto the V\nFB1 and V FB2 pins. An error amplifier compares the \ndivided output voltage with a reference voltage of 0.8V and adjusts the peak inductor current accordingly. Undervoltage comparators will pull the PGOOD output low when either output voltage is 6% below its targeted value.\nMain Control Loop\nFor each regulator, during normal operation, the P-chan-\nnel MOSFET power switch is turned on at the beginning of a clock cycle when the V\nFB voltage is below the refer -\nence voltage. The current into the inductor and the load increases until the current limit is reached. The switch turns off and energy stored in the inductor flows through the bottom N-channel MOSFET switch into the load until the next clock cycle.\nThe peak inductor current is controlled by the voltage \non the I\nTH pin, which is the output of the error amplifier . \nThis amplifier compares the V FB pin to the 0.8V reference. \nWhen the load current increases the V FB voltage decreases \nslightly below the reference. This decrease causes the er -\nror amplifier to increase the I TH voltage until the average \ninductor current matches the new load current.\nThe main control loop is shut down by pulling the RUN pin \nto ground. A digital soft-start is enabled after shutdown, which will slowly ramp the peak inductor current up over 1024 clock cycles.\nLow Current Operation\nThree modes are available to control the operation of \nthe L TC3417A at low currents. Each of the three modes automatically switch from continuous operation to the selected mode when the load current is low.To optimize efficiency, Burst Mode operation can be selected. When the load is relatively light, the L TC3417A automatically switches into Burst Mode operation in which the PMOS switches operate intermittently based on load demand. By running cycles periodically, the switching losses, which are dominated by the gate charge losses of the power MOSFETs, are minimized. The main control loop is interrupted when the output voltage reaches the desired regulated value. The hysteresis voltage comparator trips when I\nTH is below 0.24V, shutting off the switch and \nreducing the power . The output capacitor and the induc-tor supply the power to the load until I\nTH exceeds 0.31V, \nturning on the switch and the main control loop which starts another cycle.\nFor lower output voltage ripple at low currents, pulse \nskipping mode can be used. In this mode, the L TC3417A continues to switch at constant frequency down to very low currents, where it will begin skipping pulses used to control the power MOSFETs.\nFinally, in forced continuous mode, the inductor current is \nconstantly cycled creating a fixed output voltage ripple at all output current levels. This feature is desirable in telecom-munications since the noise is a constant frequency and is thus easy to filter out. Another advantage of this mode is that the regulator is capable of both sourcing current into a load and sinking some current from the output.\nThe mode selection for the L TC3417A is set using the \nSYNC/MODE pin. The SYNC/MODE pin sets the mode for both the1A and the 1.5A step-down DC/DC converters.\nDropout Operation\nWhen the input supply voltage decreases toward the output \nvoltage, the duty cycle increases to 100%. In this dropout condition, the PMOS switch is turned on continuously with the output voltage being equal to the input voltage minus the voltage drops across the internal P-channel MOSFET and inductor .\nLow Supply Operation\nThe L TC3417A incorporates an undervoltage lockout circuit \nwhich shuts down the part when the input voltage drops below about 2.07V to prevent unstable operation.opera Tion\nLTC3417A\n9\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nFigure 1.

Once L1 and L2 are chosen, C\nIN, \nCOUT1 and C OUT2 can be selected.\nOperating Frequency\nSelection of the operating frequency is a tradeoff between \nefficiency and component size. High frequency operation allows the use of smaller inductor and capacitor values. Operation at lower frequencies improves efficiency by reducing internal gate charge losses but requires larger inductance values and/or capacitance to maintain low output ripple voltage.\nThe operating frequency, f\nO, of the L TC3417A is determined \nby pulling the FREQ pin to V IN for 1.5MHz operation or \nby connecting an external resistor from FREQ to ground.  \nThe value of the resistor sets the ramp current that is used to charge and discharge an internal timing capacitor within the oscillator and can be calculated by using the following equation:\n  RT≈1.61•1011\nfOΩ( )– 16.586k Ω\nfor 0.6MHz ≤ f O ≤ 4MHz. Alternatively, use Figure 1 to \nselect the value for R T. The maximum operating frequency is also constrained by the minimum on-time and duty cycle. This can be calculated as:\n  fO(MAX) ≈6.67VOUT\nVIN(MAX)⎛\n⎝⎜⎜⎞\n⎠⎟⎟MHz( )\nThe minimum frequency is limited by leakage and noise \ncoupling due to the large resistance of R T.\nInductor Selection\nAlthough the inductor does not influence the operating \nfrequency, the inductor value has a direct effect on ripple current. The inductor ripple current, \n∆IL, decreases with \nhigher inductance and increases with higher V IN or \nVOUT.\n  ∆IL=VOUT\nfO•L1–VOUT\nVIN⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nAccepting larger values of ∆IL allows the use of low induc-\ntances, but results in higher output voltage ripple, greater \ncore losses and lower output current capability.\nA reasonable starting point for setting ripple current is  \n∆IL = 0.35I LOAD(MAX) , where I LOAD(MAX)  is the maximum \ncurrent output. The largest ripple, ∆I L, occurs at the maxi-\nmum input voltage. To guarantee that the ripple current stays below a specified maximum, the inductor value should be chosen according to the following equation:\n  L=VOUT\nfO•∆IL1–VOUT\nVIN(MAX)⎛\n⎝⎜⎜⎞\n⎠⎟⎟\nThe inductor value will also have an effect on Burst Mode \noperation. The transition from low current operation begins when the peak inductor current falls below a level set by the burst clamp. Lower inductor values result in higher ripple current which causes this to occur at lower load currents. This causes a dip in efficiency in the upper range of low current operation. In Burst Mode operation, lower inductor values will cause the burst frequency to increase.\nFREQUENCY (MHz)0RT (k/uni03A9)\n6080100\n1.5 2.5 3.5 3.0 4.0\n3417 F0140\n20\n0\n0.5 1.0 2.0120140160\n4.5\nLTC3417A\n10\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nInductor Core Selection\nDifferent core materials and shapes will change the size/\ncurrent relationship of an inductor . Toroid or shielded pot cores in ferrite or permalloy materials are small and don’t radiate much energy, but generally cost more than powdered iron core inductors with similar electrical characteristics. The choice of which style inductor to use often depends more on the price vs size requirements of any radiated field/EMI requirements than on what the L TC3417A requires to operate. Table 1 shows some typical surface mount inductors that work well in  \nL TC3417A applications.\nInput Capacitor (C\nIN) Selection\nIn continuous mode, the input current of the converter can \nbe approximated by the sum of two square waves with duty cycles of approximately V\nOUT1/VIN and V OUT2/VIN. To \nprevent large voltage transients, a low equivalent series resistance (ESR) input capacitor sized for the maximum RMS current must be used. Some capacitors have a de-rating spec for maximum RMS current. If the capaci-tor being used has this requirement, it is necessary to calculate the maximum RMS current. The RMS current calculation is different if the part is used in “in phase” or “out of phase”. \nFor “in phase”, there are two different equations:V\nOUT1 > V OUT2:\n IRMS=2•I1•I2•D2(1– D1 ) +I22(D2 – D22)+I12(D1– D12)\nVOUT2 > V OUT1:\n IRMS=2•I1•I2•D1 (1– D2) +I22(D2 – D22)+I12(D1– D12)\nwhere:\n  D1=VOUT1\nVINand D2 =VOUT2\nVIN \nTable 1\nMANUFACTURER PART NUMBER VALUE (µH) MAX DC CURRENT (A) DCR DIMENSIONS L × W × H (mm)\nL1 on OUT1\nToko A920CY-1R5M-D62CB \nA918CY-1R5M-D62LCB1.5 1.52.8 2.90.014 0.0186 × 6 × 2.5 6 × 6 × 2\nCoilcraft DO1608C-152ML 1.5 2.6 0.06 6.6 × 4.5 × 2.9\nSumida CDRH4D22/HP 1R5 1.5 3.9 0.031 5 × 5 × 2.4\nMidcom DUP-1813-1R4R 1.4 5.5 0.033 4.3 × 4.8 × 3.5\nL2  on OUT2\nToko A915AY-2R0M-D53LC 2.0 3.9 0.027 5 × 5 × 3\nCoilcraft DO1608C-222ML 2.2 2.3 0.07 6.6 × 4.5 × 2.9\nSumida CDRH3D16/HP 2R2 \nCDRH2D18/HP 2R22.2 2.21.75 \n1.60.047 0.0354 × 4 × 1.8 3.2 × 3.2 × 2\nMidcom DUP-1813-2R2R 2.2 3.9 0.047 4.3 × 4.8 × 3.5\nLTC3417A\n11\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nWhen D1 = D2 then the equation simplifies to:\n  IRMS=I1+I2( ) D 1– D( )\nor \n  IRMS=I1+I2( )VOUT VIN– VOUT ( )\nVIN\nwhere the maximum average output currents I 1 and I 2 \nequal the respective peak currents minus half the peak-\nto-peak ripple currents:\n  I1=ILIM1–∆IL1\n2\nI2=ILIM2 –∆IL2\n2\nThese formula have a maximum at V IN = 2V OUT, where \nIRMS = (I1 + I2)/2. This simple worst case is commonly \nused to determine the highest I RMS. \nFor “out of phase” operation, the ripple current can be lower than the “in phase” current.\nIn the “out of phase” case, the maximum I\nRMS does not \noccur when V OUT1 = VOUT2. The maximum typically oc-\ncurs when V OUT1 – VIN/2 = V OUT2 or when V OUT2 – VIN/2 \n= VOUT1. As a good rule of thumb, the amount of worst \ncase ripple is about 75% of the worst case ripple in the \n“in phase” mode. Also note that when V OUT1 = VOUT2 = \nVIN/2 and I 1 = I2, the ripple is zero.\nNote that capacitor manufacturer’s ripple current ratings are often based on only 2000 hours lifetime. This makes it advisable to further derate the capacitor, or choose a capacitor rated at a higher temperature than required. Several capacitors may also be paralleled to meet the size or height requirements of the design. An additional 0.1µF to 1µF ceramic capacitor is also recommended on V\nIN for high frequency decoupling, when not using an all \nceramic capacitor solution.Output Capacitor (C OUT1 and C OUT2) Selection\nThe selection of C OUT1 and C OUT2 is driven by the required \nESR to minimize voltage ripple and load step transients. Typically, once the ESR requirement is satisfied, the capacitance is adequate for filtering. The output ripple (\n∆VOUT) is determined by:\n  ∆VOUT≈ ∆ILESRCOUT +1\n8•fO•COUT⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nwhere f O = operating frequency, C OUT = output capacitance \nand ∆IL = ripple current in the inductor . The output ripple \nis highest at maximum input voltage, since ∆IL increases \nwith input voltage. With ∆IL = 0.35I LOAD(MAX) , the output \nripple will be less than 100mV at maximum V IN and f O = \n1MHz with:\n ESR COUT < 150mΩ \nOnce the ESR requirements for C OUT have been met, the \nRMS current rating generally far exceeds the I RIPPLE(P-P) \nrequirement, except for an all ceramic solution.\nIn surface mount applications, multiple capacitors may \nhave to be paralleled to meet the capacitance, ESR or RMS current handling requirement of the application. Aluminum electrolytic, special polymer , ceramic and dry tantalum capacitors are all available in surface mount packages. The OS-CON semiconductor dielectric capacitor avail-able from Sanyo has the lowest ESR(size) product of any aluminum electrolytic at a somewhat higher price. Special polymer capacitors, such as Sanyo POSCAP , offer very low ESR, but have a lower capacitance density than other types. Tantalum capacitors have the highest capacitance density, but it has a larger ESR and it is critical that the capacitors are surge tested for use in switching power supplies. An excellent choice is the AVX TPS series of surface tantalums, available in case heights ranging from 2mm to 4mm. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors have a significantly larger ESR, and are often used in extremely cost-sensitive applications provided that consideration \nLTC3417A\n12\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nis given to ripple current ratings and long term reliability. \nCeramic capacitors have the lowest ESR and cost but also have the lowest capacitance density, high voltage and temperature coefficient and exhibit audible piezoelectric effects. In addition, the high Q of ceramic capacitors along with trace inductance can lead to significant ringing. Other capacitor types include the Panasonic specialty polymer (SP) capacitors.\nIn most cases, 0.1µF to 1µF of ceramic capacitors should \nalso be placed close to the L TC3417A in parallel with the main capacitors for high frequency decoupling.\nCeramic Input and Output Capacitors\nHigher value, lower cost ceramic capacitors are now \nbecoming available in smaller case sizes. Because the L TC3417 control loop does not depend on the output capacitor’s ESR for stable operation, ceramic capacitors can be used freely to achieve very low output ripple and small circuit size. When choosing the input and output ceramic capacitors, choose the X5R or X7R dielectric formulations. These dielectrics have the best temperature and voltage characteristics of all the ceramics for a given value and size.\nGreat care must be taken when using only ceramic input \nand output capacitors. When a ceramic capacitor is used at the input and the power is being supplied through long wires, such as from a wall adapter , a load step at the output can induce ringing at the V\nIN pin. At best, this ringing can \ncouple to the output and be mistaken as loop instability. At worst, the ringing at the input can be large enough to damage the part.\nSince the ESR of a ceramic capacitor is so low, the input \nand output capacitor must fulfill a charge storage re-quirement. During a load step, the output capacitor must instantaneously supply the current to support the load until the feedback loop raises the switch current enough to support the load. The time required for the feedback loop to respond is dependent on the compensation com-ponents and the output capacitor size. Typically, 3 to 4 cycles are required to respond to a load step, but only in the first cycle does the output drop linearly. The output droop, V\nDROOP , is usually about 2 to 3 times the linear \ndroop of the first cycle. Thus, a good place to start is with the output capacitor size of approximately:\n  COUT≈2.5∆IOUT\nfO•VDROOP\nMore capacitance may be required depending on the duty cycle and load step requirements.\nIn most applications, the input capacitor is merely required \nto supply high frequency bypassing, since the impedance to the supply is very low. A 10µF ceramic capacitor is usually enough for these conditions.\nSetting the Output Voltage\nThe LTC3417A develops a 0.8V reference voltage between \nthe feedback pins, V\nFB1 and V FB2, and the signal ground \nas shown in Figure 4. The output voltages are set by two resistive dividers according to the following formulas:\n  VOUT1 ≈0.8V 1+R1\nR2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nVOUT2 ≈0.8V 1+R3\nR4⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nKeeping the current small (<5µA) in these resistors \nmaximizes efficiency, but making the current too small may allow stray capacitance to cause noise problems and reduce the phase margin of the error amp loop.\nTo improve the frequency response, a feed-forward ca-\npacitor , C\nF, may also be used. Great care should be taken \nto route the V FB node away from noise sources, such as \nthe inductor or the SW line.\nSoft-Start\nSoft-start reduces surge currents from V IN by gradu-\nally increasing the peak inductor current. Power supply \nsequencing can also be accomplished by controlling the I\nTH pin. The L TC3417A has an internal digital soft-start \nfor each regulator output, which steps up a clamp on \nLTC3417A\n13\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nFigure 2. Digital Soft-Start OUT1\nITH over 1024 clock cycles, as can be seen in Figures 2 \nand 3. As the voltage on I TH ramps through its operating \nrange, the internal peak current limit is also ramped at a \nproportional linear rate.\nMode Selection\nThe SYNC/MODE pin is a multipurpose pin which provides \nmode selection and frequency synchronization. Connect-ing this pin to V\nIN enables Burst Mode operation for both \nregulators, which provides the best low current efficiency at the cost of a higher output voltage ripple. When SYNC/MODE is connected to ground, pulse skipping operation is selected for both regulators, which provides the lowest output voltage and current ripple at the cost of low cur -\nrent efficiency. Applying a voltage that is more than 1V from either supply results in forced continuous mode for both regulators, which creates a fixed output ripple and allows the sinking of some current (about 1/2\n∆IL). Since \nthe switching noise is constant in this mode, it is also the easiest to filter out. In many cases, the output voltage can be simply connected to the SYNC/MODE pin, select-ing the forced continuous mode except at start-up. The L TC3417A can also be synchronized to an external clock signal by the SYNC/MODE pin. The internal oscillator fre-quency should be set to 20% lower than the external clock frequency to ensure adequate slope compensation, since slope compensation is derived from the internal oscillator . During synchronization, the mode is set to pulse skipping Figure 3. Digital Soft-Start OUT2\nVIN = 3.6V\nVOUT = 1.8V\nRL = 0.9/uni03A9200µs/DIVIL\n1A/DIVVOUT\n1V/DIVVRUN\n2V/DIV\nVIN = 3.6V\nVOUT = 2.5V\nRL = 2/uni03A9200µs/DIVIL\n0.5A/DIVVOUT\n1V/DIVVRUN\n2V/DIV\nand the top switch turn-on is synchronized to the rising edge of the external clock.\nWhen using an external clock, with the PHASE pin low, the \nswitching of the two channels occur at the edges of the external clock. A 50% duty cycle will therefore produce 180° out-of-phase operation.\nChecking T ransient Response\nThe I\nTH pin compensation allows the transient response \nto be optimized for a wide range of loads and output \ncapacitors. The availability of the I TH pin not only allows \noptimization of the control loop behavior, but also pro-vides a DC coupled and AC filtered closed-loop response test point. The DC step, rise time, and settling at this test point truly reflects the closed-loop response. Assuming a predominantly second order system, phase margin and/or damping factor can be estimated using the percentage of overshoot seen at this pin. The bandwidth can also be estimated using the percentage of overshoot seen at this pin or by examining the rise time at this pin.\nThe I\nTH external components shown in the Figure 4 circuit \nwill provide an adequate starting point for most applica-\ntions. The series RC filter sets the dominant pole-zero loop compensation. The values can be modified slightly (from 0.5 to 2 times their suggested values) to optimize transient response once the final PC layout is done and the particular output capacitor type and value have been \nLTC3417A\n14\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\ndetermined. The output capacitors need to be selected \nbecause of various types and values determine the loop feedback factor gain and phase. An output current pulse of 20% to 100% of full load current having a rise time of 1µs to 10µs will produce output voltage and I\nTH pin \nwaveforms that will give a sense of overall loop stability without breaking the feedback loop.\nSwitching regulators take several cycles to respond to a \nstep in load current. When a load step occurs, V\nOUT im-\nmediately shifts by an amount equal to ∆ILOAD • ESR COUT, \nwhere ESR COUT is the effective series resistance of C OUT. \n∆ILOAD also begins to charge or discharge C OUT generat-\ning a feedback error signal used by the regulator to return V\nOUT to its steady-state value. During this recovery time,  \nVOUT can be monitored for overshoot or ringing that would \nindicate a stability problem.\nThe initial output voltage step may not be within the band-\nwidth of the feedback loop, so the standard second order overshoot/DC ratio cannot be used to determine phase margin. The gain of the loop increases with R\nITH and the \nbandwidth of the loop increases with decreasing C ITH. If \nRITH is increased by the same factor that C ITH is decreased, \nthe zero frequency will be kept the same, thereby keeping the phase the same in the most critical frequency range of the feedback loop. In addition, feedforward capacitors, C1 and C2, can be added to improve the high frequency response, as shown in Figure 4. Capacitor C1 provides phase lead by creating a high frequency zero with R1 which improves the phase margin for the 1.5A SW1 chan-nel. Capacitor C2 provides phase lead by creating a high frequency zero with R3 which improves the phase margin for the 1A SW2 channel.\nThe output voltage settling behavior is related to the stability \nof the closed-loop system and will demonstrate the actual overall supply performance. For a detailed explanation of optimizing the compensation components, including a review of control loop theory, refer to Linear Technology Application Note 76.\nAlthough a buck regulator is capable of providing the full \noutput current in dropout, it should be noted that as the input voltage V\nIN drops toward V OUT, the load step capability \ndoes decrease due to the decreasing voltage across the inductor . Applications that require large load step capabil-ity near dropout should use a different topology such as SEPIC, Zeta, or single inductor , positive buck boost.\nIn some applications, a more severe transient can be caused \nby switching in loads with large (>1µF) input capacitors. The discharged input capacitors are effectively put in paral-lel with C\nOUT, causing a rapid drop in V OUT. No regulator \ncan deliver enough current to prevent this problem, if the switch connecting the load has low resistance and is driven quickly. The solution is to limit the turn-on speed of the load switch driver . A Hot Swap™ controller is designed specifically for this purpose and usually incorporates cur -\nrent limiting, short-circuit protection, and soft-starting.\nEfficiency Considerations\nThe percent efficiency of a switching regulator is equal to \nthe output power divided by the input power times 100. It is often useful to analyze individual losses to determine what is limiting the efficiency and which change would produce the most improvement. Percent efficiency can be expressed as:\n % Efficiency = 100% – (P1+ P2 + P3 +…)\nwhere P1, \nP2, etc. are the individual losses as a percent-\nage of input power .\nAlthough all dissipative elements in the circuit produce \nlosses, four main sources account for most of the losses in L TC3417A circuits: 1) L TC3417A I\nS current, 2) switching \nlosses, 3) I2R losses, 4) other losses.\n1) The I S current is the DC supply current given in the elec-\ntrical characteristics which excludes MOSFET driver and control currents. I\nS current results in a small (<0.1%) \nloss that increases with V IN, even at no load.\n2) The switching current is the sum of the MOSFET driver and control currents. The MOSFET driver current re-sults from switching the gate capacitance of the power MOSFET\ns. Each time a MOSFET gate is switched from \nLTC3417A\n15\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nlow to high to low again, a packet of charge moves from \nVIN to ground. The resulting charge over the switching \nperiod is a current out of V IN that is typically much larger \nthan the DC bias current. The gate charge losses are proportional to V\nIN and thus their effects will be more \npronounced at higher supply voltages.\n3) I2R losses are calculated from the DC resistances of the \ninternal switches, R SW, and the external inductor, R L. In \ncontinuous mode, the average output current flowing through inductor L is “chopped” between the internal top and bottom switches. Thus, the series resistance looking into the SW pin is a function of both top and bottom MOSFET R\nDS(ON)  and the duty cycle (DC) as \nfollows:\n RSW = (R DS(ON) TOP)(DC) + (R DS(ON) BOT)(1 – DC)\nThe R DS(ON)  for both the top and bottom MOSFETs can \nbe obtained from the Typical Performance Characteristics curves. Thus, to obtain I\n2R losses:\n I2R losses = I OUT2(RSW + RL)\nwhere R L is the resistance of the inductor.\n4) Other “hidden” losses such as copper trace and internal battery resistances can account for additional efficiency\n \ndegradations in portable systems. It is very important to include these “system” level losses in the design of a system. The internal battery and fuse resistance losses can be minimized by making sure that C\nIN has \nadequate charge storage and very low ESR COUT at \nthe switching frequency. Other losses including diode conduction losses during dead-time and inductor core losses generally account for less than 2% total additional loss.\nThermal Considerations\nThe L TC3417A requires the package Exposed Pad \n(PGND2/GNDD pin) to be well soldered to the PC board. This gives the DFN and TSSOP packages exceptional thermal properties, compared to similar packages of this size, making it difficult in normal operation to exceed the maximum junction temperature of the part. In a majority of applications, the L TC3417A does not dissipate much heat due to its high efficiency. However, in applications where the L TC3417A is running at high ambient tem-perature with low supply voltage and high duty cycles, such as in dropout, the heat dissipated may exceed the maximum junction temperature of the part. If the junction temperature reaches approximately 150°C, both switches in both regulators will be turned off and the SW nodes will become high impedance.\nTo prevent the L TC3417A from exceeding its maximum \njunction temperature, the user will need to do some thermal analysis. The goal of the thermal analysis is to determine whether the power dissipated exceeds the maximum junction temperature of the part. The temperature rise is given by:\n TRISE = P D • θJA\nwhere P D is the power dissipated by the regulator and θ JA \nis the thermal resistance from the junction of the die to the ambient temperature.\nThe junction temperature, T\nJ, is given by:\n TJ = TRISE + TAMBIENT\nAs an example, consider the case when the L TC3417A is \nin dropout in both regulators at an input voltage of 3.3V with load currents of 1.5A and 1A. From the Typical Per -\nformance Characteristics graph of Switch Resistance, the R\nDS(ON) resistance of the 1.5A P-channel switch is 0.09Ω \nand the R DS(ON)  of the 1A P-channel switch is 0.163Ω. \nThe power dissipated by the part is:\n PD = I 12 • RDS(ON)1  + I22 • RDS(ON)2\n PD = 1.52 • 0.09 + 12 • 0.163\n PD = 366mW\nThe DFN package junction-to-ambient thermal resistance, θ\nJA, is about 43°C/W . Therefore, the junction temperature \nof the regulator operating in a 70°C ambient temperature is approximately:\n TJ = 0.366 • 43 + 70\n TJ = 85.7°C\nLTC3417A\n16\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nRemembering that the above junction temperature is \nobtained from an R DS(ON) at 25°C, we might recalculate \nthe junction temperature based on a higher R DS(ON) since \nit increases with temperature. However , we can safely as-sume that the actual junction temperature will not exceed the absolute maximum junction temperature of 125°C.\nDesign Example\nAs a design example, consider using the L TC3417A in \na portable application with a Li-Ion battery. The battery provides a V\nIN from 2.8V to 4.2V . One load requires 1.8V \nat 1.5A in active mode, and 1mA in standby mode. The other load requires 2.5V at 1A in active mode, and 500µA in standby mode. Since both loads still need power in standby, Burst Mode operation is selected for good low load efficiency (SYNC/MODE = V\nIN).\nFirst, determine what frequency should be used. Higher frequency results in a lower inductor value for a given ∆I\nL \n(∆IL is estimated as 0.35I LOAD(MAX) ). Reasonable values \nfor wire wound surface mount inductors are usually in the range of 1µH to 10µH.\nCONVERTER OUTPUT I LOAD(MAX) ∆IL\nSW1 1.5A 525mA\nSW2 1A 350mA\nUsing the 1.5MHz frequency setting (FREQ = V IN), we get \nthe following equations for L1 and L2:\n  L1=1.8V\n1.5MHz •525mA1–1.8V\n4.2V⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟=1.3µH\nUse 1.5µH.\nL2=2.5V\n1.5MHz •350mA1–2.5V\n4.2V⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟=1.9µH\nUse 2.2µH.COUT selection is based on load step droop instead of ESR \nrequirements. For a 2.5% output droop:\n  COUT1 =2.5•1.5A\n1.5MHz 5% •1.8V ( )=28µF\nCOUT2 =2.5•1A\n1.5MHz 5% •2.5V ( )=13µF\nThe closest standard values are 47µF and 22µF .\nThe output voltages can now be programmed by choos-\ning the values of R1, R2, R3, and R4. To maintain high efficiency, the current in these resistors should be kept small. Choosing 2µA with the 0.8V feedback voltages makes R2 and R4 equal to 400k. A close standard 1% resistor is 412k. This then makes R1 = 515k. A close standard 1% is 511k. Similarily, with R4 at 412k, R3 is equal to 875k. A close 1% resistor is 866k.\nThe compensation should be optimized for these com-\nponents by examining the load step response, but a good place to start for the L TC3417A is with a 5.9kΩ and 2200pF filter on I\nTH1 and 2.87k and 6800pF on I TH2. The \noutput capacitor may need to be increased depending on the actual undershoot during a load step.\nThe PGOOD pin is a common drain output and requires a \npull-up resistor. A 100k resistor is used for adequate speed. Figure 4 shows a complete schematic for this design.\nLTC3417A\n17\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nOUT1 Efficiency vs Load Current\nFigure 4. 1.8V at 1.5A/2.5V at 1A Step-Down RegulatorsSYNC/MODE\nSW1RUN1\nV\nFB1\nPHASE\nITH1PGOOD\nSW2\nRUN2\nVFB2\nFREQ\nITH2VIN1\nLTC3417A\nGNDAEXPOSED\nPAD GNDDVIN2CIN\n10µFCIN1\n0.1µFCIN2\n0.1µF\nL1\n1.5µHL2\n2.2µH\nC1 22pF\nR1 511kC2 22pF\nR3 866kVIN VIN\nVINR7\n100k\nR2\n412kR4412kC\nOUT2\n22µF\nR5\n5.9kR62.87k\nC3\n2200pFC46800pF\n3417 F04COUT1\n47µFVOUT1\n1.8V1.5AV\nOUT2\n2.5V1AV\nIN\n2.25V TO 5.5V\nL1: MIDCOM DUS-5121-1R5RC\nOUT1 : KEMET C1210C226K8PACL2: MIDCOM DUS-5121-2R2RC\nOUT2 , CIN: KEMET C1206C106K4PAC\nLOAD CURRENT (A)80EFFICIENCY (%)POWER LOSS (W)\n90100\n758595\n0.001 0.1 1 10\n3417 F04a700.110\n0.011\n0.001\n0.01VIN = 3.6V\nVOUT = 1.8V\nFREQ = 1MHz\nREFER TO FIGURE 4\nEFFICIENCY\nPOWER LOSS\nLTC3417A\n18\n3417afcapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nBoard Layout Considerations\nWhen laying out the printed circuit board, the following \nchecklist should be used to ensure proper operation of the L TC3417A. These items are also illustrated graphically in the layout diagram of Figure 5. Check the following in your layout.\n1\n.  Does the capacitor C IN connect to the power V IN1 \n(Pin 2), \nVIN2 (Pin 8), and PGND2/GNDD (Pin 17) as \nclose as possible (DFN package)? It may be necessary \nto split C IN into two capacitors. This capacitor provides \nthe AC current to the internal power MOSFETs and their drivers.\n2. Are the C OUT1, L1 and C OUT2, L2 closely connected? The \n(–) plate of C OUT1 returns current to PGND1, and the  \n(–) plate of C OUT2 returns current to the PGND2/GNDD  \nand the (–) plate of C IN.\n3. The resistor divider , R1 and R2, must be connected between the \n(+) plate of C OUT1 and a ground line ter -\nminated near GNDA. The resistor divider , R3 and R4, must be connected between the (+) plate of C OUT2 and \na ground line terminated near GNDA. The feedback signals V\nFB1 and V FB2 should be routed away from noise \ncomponents and traces, such as the SW lines, and its trace should be minimized.\n4. \n Keep sensitive components away from the SW pins. The input capacitor C\nIN, the compensation capacitors \nCC1, CC2, CITH1 and C ITH2 and all resistors R1, R2, R3, \nR4, R ITH1 and R ITH2 should be routed away from the \nSW traces and the inductors L1 and L2.\n5.  A ground plane is preferred, but if not available, keep the signal and power grounds segregated with small signal components returning to the GNDA pin at one point which is then connected to the \nPGND2/GNDD  \npin.\n6. Flood all unused areas on all layers with copper . Flooding\n \nwith copper will reduce the temperature rise of power components. These copper areas should be connected to one of the input supplies.\nFigure 5.
