The capacitor can be charged to above \n2.0V in less than 10u s. Before the capacitor voltage, VCN, charged up , /FAULT  stays low/active , disregard ing \nIN’s logic level. After the negative bias is ready , both NEG  pin and /FAULT  pin are released and OUT starts to \nfollow input signal IN. A built -in negative voltage regulator regulates the negative voltage to -3.5V for normal \noperation, regardless of PWM freque ncy and duty cycle. The gate drive signal,  NEG , then switches between \nVCC-3.5V and -3.5V.   \n \n7.4  Under Voltage Protections and Programming  \nAll internal and external biases of the driver are monitored to ensure a healthy operation condition. V CC is \nmonitored by a programmable under voltage detection circuit. The driver o utput is shut down ( pulled low) or \nstays low if the voltage is below set limit.   The external /FAULT  pull-up resistor is utilized as a V CC UVLO \nprogramming resistor for UVLO setting. The pull -up resistor is tied to 5VREF. At startup, the pull -up \nresistance can be sensed by internal circuit. Based on the resistance value, a corresponding UVLO level is \nselected. The Electrical Specifications table above gives the detail s of the settings.  Note that the table gives \nVCC  UVLO thresholds, which are 3.5V higher than gate voltages . \nThe negative voltage is also monitored.  Its UVLO has a fix 1.5 V negative -going  threshold. Negative voltage \ncapacitor defect could result in the capacitor voltage below the threshold . The UVLO protect ion will then pull \nMOSFET’s gate to ground . The  /FAULT  is pulled low when UVLO is detected.  \n7.5  Desatur ation Detection  \nWhen short circuit or over current  happens, the power device’s (SiC MOSFET or IGBT) drain or collector \ncurrent  can increase to such a  high value that the devices  get out of saturation state, and Vds /Vce of the \ndevices will rise to a substantial ly high value. DESAT pin with a blanking capacitor Cblk, normally clamped to \nId x Rds_on, now is able to charge  up much higher by an internal 1mA constant current source. When the \nvoltage reaches typical 9.5V thres hold,  OUT  and /FAULT  are both pulled low. A 20 0ns blank time is inserted \nat OUT rising edge to prevent DESAT  protect circuit from being triggered prematurely due to Coss discharge .  \nTo minimize the loss of internal constant current source , the current source is turned off when the main switch \nis at off state. By selecting a different capacitance, turn-off delay time  (external blanking time)  can be \nprogrammed.  The blanking time can be calculated with,  \n        Teblk = C blk ∙Vth / IDESAT  \nFor example, if C blk is 47pF,  Teblk = 47pF ∙9. 5V / 1mA = 44 6ns. \nNote T eblk includes internal Tblk 200n s blanking time already.   \nFor current limit setting, the following equation can be used,  \n    Ilimit = (V th – R1* I DESAT  – VF_D1)/ R ds_on  \nwhere R1 is a programming resistor, V F_D1 is high voltage diode forward voltage, R ds_on is SiC MOSFET turn -\non resistance at estimated junction temperature , such as 175C.   \nA different power system us ually requires a different turn -off time. An optimized  turn-off time can maximize \nthe system short circuit capability while  limiting Vds and bus voltage ringing.   \n7.6  Fault  \n/FAULT  is an open collector output  with no internal pull -up resistance . When  desaturation and  under voltage s \nare detected, the /FAULT pin and OUT are both  pulled low. The /FAULT  signal  will stay at low for 10us after  \nApr 2020, R3                                                                                                                                                                        \n                        \n9 \n \nthe faul t condition is removed . /FAULT  is an auto recovery signal. System controller will need to decide how \nto respond the /FAULT  signal .

It is a general rule that capacitors have \na higher priority than resistors for loca tion arrangement. A 1uF and a 0.1uF decoupling capacitors \nshould be close to VCC pin and grounded to the driver ground plane. Negative voltage capacitor should \nlocate near to OUT and NEG  pins.
