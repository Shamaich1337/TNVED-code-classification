The fast transient response of D-CAP2 \ncontrol scheme can reduce the output capacitance required to meet a specific level of performance.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n2 SW\nZCXCONPWMControl Logic+\n+\n+UVP\nOVP3VIN\nTon\nOne-Shot6VBST\n+4 VFB\nOCL++\nSoft Start5 EN\nHS\nLS\n1 GNDSSVoltage\nReferenceRefHiccup VUVP\nVOVP\nOCL\nthresholdRegulator\nUVLOVREG5\nVREG5\nTSDTPS562200, TPS563200\nSLVSCB0E – JANUARY 2014 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS562200  TPS563200\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 The Adaptive On-Time Control And PWM Operation\nThe main control loop of the TPS562200 and TPS563200 are adaptive on-time pulse width modulation (PWM) \ncontroller that supports a proprietary D-CAP2 control scheme. The D-CAP2 control scheme combines adaptive \non-time control with an internal compensation circuit for pseudo-fixed frequency and low external component \ncount configuration with both low ESR and ceramic output capacitors. It is stable even with virtually no ripple at \nthe output.\nAt the beginning of each cycle, the high-side MOSFET is turned on. This MOSFET is turned off after internal one \nshot timer expires. This one shot duration is set inversely proportional to the converter input voltage, V IN, and \nproportional to the output voltage, V O, to maintain a pseudo-fixed frequency over the input voltage range, hence \nit is called adaptive on-time control. The one-shot timer is reset and the high-side MOSFET is turned on again \nwhen the feedback voltage falls below the reference voltage. An internal ramp is added to reference voltage to \nsimulate output ripple, eliminating the need for ESR induced output ripple from D-CAP2 control scheme.\n7.3.2 Advanced Eco-mode Control\nThe TPS562200 and TPS563200 are designed with Advanced Eco-mode to maintain high light load efficiency. \nAs the output current decreases from heavy load condition, the inductor current is also reduced and eventually \ncomes to point that its rippled valley touches zero level, which is the boundary between continuous conduction \nand discontinuous conduction modes. The rectifying MOSFET is turned off when the zero inductor current is \ndetected. As the load current further decreases, the converter runs into discontinuous conduction mode. The \non-time is kept almost the same as it was in the continuous conduction mode so that it takes longer time \nto discharge the output capacitor with smaller load current to the level of the reference voltage. This makes \nthe switching frequency lower, proportional to the load current, and keeps the light load efficiency high. The \ntransition point to the light load operation I OUT(LL ) current can be calculated in Equation 1 .\n/c40 /c41IN OUT OUT\nOUT(LL)\nSW INV V V 1I2 L ƒ V/c45 /c180/c61 /c180/c180 /c180\n(1)\n7.3.3 Soft Start And Pre-Biased Soft Start\nThe TPS562200 and TPS563200 have an internal 1 ms soft-start. When the EN pin becomes high, the internal \nsoft-start function begins ramping up the reference voltage to the PWM comparator. If the output capacitor is \npre-biased at startup, the devices initiate switching and start ramping up only after the internal reference voltage \nbecomes greater than the feedback voltage VFB. This scheme ensures that the converters ramp up smoothly \ninto regulation point.\n7.3.4 Current Protection\nThe output overcurrent limit (OCL) is implemented using a cycle-by-cycle valley detect control circuit. The switch \ncurrent is monitored during the OFF state by measuring the low-side FET drain to source voltage. This voltage is \nproportional to the switch current. To improve accuracy, the voltage sensing is temperature compensated.\nDuring the on time of the high-side FET switch, the switch current increases at a linear rate determined by V IN, \nVOUT, the on-time and the output inductor value. During the on time of the low-side FET switch, this current \ndecreases linearly. The average value of the switch current is the load current I OUT. If the monitored current \nis above the OCL level, the converter maintains low-side FET on and delays the creation of a new set pulse, \neven the voltage feedback loop requires one, until the current level becomes OCL level or lower. In subsequent \nswitching cycles, the on-time is set to a fixed value and the current is monitored in the same manner. If the over \ncurrent condition exists consecutive switching cycles, the internal OCL threshold is set to a lower level, reducing \nthe available output current. When a switching cycle occurs where the switch current is not above the lower OCL \nthreshold, the counter is reset and the OCL threshold is returned to the higher value.\nThere are some important considerations for this type of over-current protection. The load current is higher \nthan the over-current threshold by one half of the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current. Also, when the current \nis being limited, the output voltage tends to fall as the demanded load current can be higher than the current \navailable from the converter. This can cause the output voltage to fall. When the VFB voltage falls below the \nwww.ti.comTPS562200, TPS563200\nSLVSCB0E – JANUARY 2014 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS562200  TPS563200\nUVP threshold voltage, the UVP comparator detects it. Then, the device shuts down after the UVP delay time \n(typically 14 µs) and re-start after the hiccup time (typically 12 ms).\nWhen the overcurrent condition is removed, the output voltage returns to the regulated value.\n7.3.5 Over Voltage Protection\nTPS562200 and TPS563200 detect overvoltage condition by monitoring the feedback voltage (VFB). When the \nfeedback voltage becomes higher than 125% of the target voltage, the OVP comparator output goes high and \nboth the high-side MOSFET driver and the low-side MOSFET driver turn off. This function is non-latch operation.\n7.3.6 UVLO Protection\nUndervoltage lock out protection (UVLO) monitors the internal regulator voltage. When the voltage is lower than \nUVLO threshold voltage, the device is shut off. This protection is non-latching.\n7.3.7 Thermal Shutdown\nThe device monitors the temperature of itself. If the temperature exceeds the threshold value (typically 155°C), \nthe device is shut off. This is a non-latch protection\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Normal Operation\nWhen the input voltage is above the UVLO threshold and the EN voltage is above the enable threshold, the \nTPS562200 and TPS563200 can operate in their normal switching modes. Normal continuous conduction mode \n(CCM) occurs when the minimum switch current is above 0 A. In CCM, the TPS562200 and TPS563200 operate \nat a quasi-fixed frequency of 650 kHz.\n7.4.2 Eco-mode Operation\nWhen the TPS562200 and TPS563200 are in the normal CCM operating mode and the switch current falls \nto 0 A, the TPS562200 and TPS563200 begin operating in pulse skipping Eco-mode. Each switching cycle \nis followed by a period of energy saving sleep time. The sleep time ends when the VFB voltage falls below \nthe Eco-mode threshold voltage. As the output current decreases the perceived time between switching pulses \nincreases.\n7.4.3 Standby Operation\nWhen the TPS562200 and TPS563200 are operating in either normal CCM or Eco-mode, they can be placed in \nstandby by asserting the EN pin low.TPS562200, TPS563200\nSLVSCB0E – JANUARY 2014 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS562200  TPS563200\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

The inductor and capacitor selected for the output filter must be selected so \nthat the double pole of Equation 3  is located below the high frequency zero but close enough that the phase \nboost provided be the high frequency zero provides adequate phase margin for a stable circuit.

Tps563200 Shutdown Relative to En\n8.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe TPS562200 and TPS563200 are designed to operate from input supply voltage in the range of 4.5 V to \n17 V. Buck converters require the input voltage to be higher than the output voltage for proper operation. The \nmaximum recommended operating duty cycle is 65%. Using that criteria, the minimum recommended input \nvoltage is V O / 0.65.\n8.4 Layout\n8.4.1 Layout Guidelines\n1.VIN and GND traces must be as wide as possible to reduce trace impedance. The wide areas are also of \nadvantage from the view point of heat dissipation.\n2.The input capacitor and output capacitor must be placed as close to the device as possible to minimize trace \nimpedance.\n3.Provide sufficient vias for the input capacitor and output capacitor.\n4.Keep the SW trace as physically short and wide as practical to minimize radiated emissions.\n5.Do not allow switching current to flow under the device.\n6.A separate VOUT path must be connected to the upper feedback resistor\n7.Make a Kelvin connection to the GND pin for the feedback path.\n8.Voltage feedback loop must be placed away from the high-voltage switching trace, and preferably has \nground shield.\n9.The trace of the VFB node must be as small as possible to avoid noise coupling.\n10.The GND trace between the output capacitor and the GND pin must be as wide as possible to minimize its \ntrace impedance.TPS562200, TPS563200\nSLVSCB0E – JANUARY 2014 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS562200  TPS563200\n8.4.2 Layout Example\nVias to the\ninternal SW\nnode copper\nEN\nVFBVBST GND\nSWFEEDBACK\nRESISTORS\nTO ENABLE\nCONTROL\nVINGND\nBOOST\nCAPACITOR\nOUTPUT\nINDUCTOROUTPUT\nCAPACITORVOUT\nINPUT BYPASS\nCAPACITORVIN\nSW node copper\npour area on internal\nor bottom layerAdditional\nVias to the\nGND plane\nHIGH FREQUENCY\nINPUT BYPASS\nCAPACITORVias to the\ninternal SW\nnode copper\nFigure 8-31.
