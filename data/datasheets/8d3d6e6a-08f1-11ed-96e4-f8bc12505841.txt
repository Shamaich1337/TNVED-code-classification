Available\nin the SOT-23 package, this device provides one   sin-\ngle-ended input with very low-power consumption.\nBased on an advanced CMOS technology, theMCP3221 provides a low maximum conversion current\nand standby current of 250 µ A and 1 µA, respectively.\nLow-current consumption, combined with the smallSOT-23 package, make this device ideal for battery-\npowered and remote data acquisition applications.\nCommunication to the MCP3221 is performed using a\n2-wire, I\n2C compatible interface. Standard (100 kHz)\nand Fast (400 kHz) I2C modes are available with the\ndevice. An on-chip conversion clock enables\nindependent timing for the I2C and conversion clocks.\nThe device is also addressable, allowing up to eight\ndevices on a single 2-wire bus.\nThe MCP3221 runs on a single-supply voltage that\noperates over a broad range  of 2.7V to 5.5V. This\ndevice also provides excellent linearity of ±1 LSB\ndifferential nonlinearity (DNL) and ±2 LSB integral\nnonlinearity (INL), maximum.\nPackage Type\n                       5-Pin SOT-23\nSCL\nAINMCP32211\n2\n35\nSDAVSSVDD\n4Low-Power 12-Bit A/D Converter with I2C Interface\nMCP3221\nDS20001732E-page 2 \uf0e3 2002-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.Functional Block Diagram\nComparator\nSample\nand \nHold12-bit SARDAC\nI2C InterfaceAINVSS VDD\nSCL SDAClock\nControl Logic–\n+\n\uf0e3 2002-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

Refer to Section 6.4 “Device Power and\nLayout Considerations”  for tips on power and\ngrounding.\n3.2 Analog Input (AIN)\nAIN is the input pin to the sample and hold circuitry of\nthe Successive Approximation Register (SAR) con-\nverter. Care should be taken in driving this pin. Refer toSection 6.1 “Driving the Analog Input”  for more\ninformation. For proper conversions, the voltage on this\npin can vary from V\nSS to VDD.3.3 Serial Data (SDA)\nSDA is a bidirectional pin used to transfer addresses\nand data into and out of the device. It is an open-drain\nterminal, therefore, the SDA bus requires a pull-upresistor to V\nDD (typically 10 k \uf057 for 100 kHz and 2 k \uf057\nfor 400 kHz SCL clock speeds). Refer to Section 6.2\n“Connecting to the I2C Bus”  for more information.\nFor normal data transfer, SDA is allowed to change only\nduring SCL low. Changes during SCL high are reserved\nfor indicating the Start an d Stop conditions. Refer to\nSection 5.1 “I2C Bus Characteristics”  for more infor-\nmation.\n3.4 Serial Clock (SCL)\nSCL is an input pin used to synchronize the data trans-\nfer to and from the device on the SDA pin and is anopen-drain terminal. Therefore, the SCL bus requires a\npull-up resistor to V\nDD (typically 10 k \uf057 for 100 kHz and\n2k\uf057 for 400 kHz SCL clock speeds. Refer to\nSection 6.2 “Connecting to the I2C Bus”  for more\ninformation.\nFor normal data transfer, SDA is allowed to change\nonly during SCL low. Changes during SCL high arereserved for indicating the Start and Stop conditions.\nRefer to Section 6.1 “Driving the Analog Input”  for\nmore information.Name Function\nV\nDD +2.7V to 5.5V Power Supply\nVSS Ground\nAIN Analog Input\nSDA Serial Data In/Out\nSCL Serial Clock In\nMCP3221\nDS20001732E-page 14 \uf0e3 2002-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.4.0 DEVICE OPERATION\nThe MCP3221 employs a classic SAR architecture.\nThis architecture uses an internal sample and hold\ncapacitor to store the anal og input while the conversion\nis taking place. At the end of the acquisition time, theinput switch of the converter opens and the device uses\nthe collected charge on the internal sample and hold\ncapacitor to produce a serial 12-bit digital output code.\nThe acquisition time and conversion is self-timed using\nan internal clock. After each conversion, the results arestored in a 12-bit register that can be read at any time.\nCommunication with the device is accomplished with a\n2-wire, I\n2C interface. Maximum sample rates of\n22.3 ksps are possible with the MCP3221 in a continu-ous-conversion mode and an SCL clock rate of\n400 kHz.\n4.1 Digital Output Code\nThe digital output code pr oduced by the MCP3221 is a\nfunction of the input signal and power supply voltage,V\nDD. As the VDD level is reduced, the LSB size is\nreduced accordingly. The theoretical LSB size is shown\nbelow.\nEQUATION\nThe output code of the MCP3221 is transmitted serially\nwith MSB first. The format of the code is straight binary.4.2 Conversion Time (tCONV )\nThe conversion time is the time required to obtain the\ndigital result once the analog input is disconnected\nfrom the holding capacitor. With the MCP3221, thespecified conversion time is typically 8.96 µs. This time\nis dependent on the internal oscillator and is\nindependent of SCL.\n4.3 Acquisition Time (tACQ)\nThe acquisition time is the amount of time the sample\ncap array is acquiring charge.\nThe acquisition time is, typically, 1.12 µs. This time is\ndependent on the internal oscillator and independent ofSCL.\n4.4 Sample Rate\nSample rate is the inverse of the maximum amount of\ntime that is required from th e point of acquisition of the\nfirst conversion to the point of acquisition of the second\nconversion.\nThe sample rate can be measured either by single or\ncontinuous conversions. A single conversion includes\na Start bit, Address byte, tw o data bytes and a Stop bit.\nThis sample rate is measured from one Start bit to the\nnext Start bit.\nFor continuous conversions  (requested by the Master\nby issuing an Acknowledge after a conversion), themaximum sample rate is measured from conversion to\nconversion or a total of 18 clocks (two data bytes and\ntwo Acknowledge bits). Refer to Section 5.2 “Device\nAddressing”  for more information.\nFIGURE 4-1: Transfer Function.LSB SIZEVDD\n4096------------=\nVDD = Supply voltage\n1111 1111 1111  (4095)\n1111 1111 1110   (4094)\nAIN0000 0000 0001  (1)0000 0000 0011  (3)Output Code\nVDD-1.5 LSB.5 LSB\n1.5 LSB\nVDD-2.5 LSB2.5 LSB0000 0000 0000  (0)0000 0000 0010  (2)\n\uf0e3 2002-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

That is, the difference in analog\ninput voltage is constant from one code transition pointto the next. Differential nonlinearity (DNL) specifies the\ndeviation of any code in the transfer function from an\nideal code width of 1 LSB. The DNL is determined by\nsubtracting the locations of  successive code transition\npoints after compensating for any gain and offseterrors. A positive DNL implies that a code is longer than\nthe ideal code width, whereas a negative DNL implies\nthat a code is shorter than the ideal width.\n4.6 Integral Non-Linearity (INL)\nIntegral nonlinearity (INL) is  a result of cumulative DNL\nerrors and specifies how much the overall transfer\nfunction deviates from a linear response. The method\nof measurement used in the MCP3221 A/D converter\nto determine INL is the end-point method.\n4.7 Offset Error\nOffset error is defined as a deviation of the code transi-\ntion points that are present  across all output codes.\nThis has the effect of shifting the entire A/D transferfunction. The offset error is  measured by finding the dif-\nference between the actual location of the first code\ntransition and the desired location of the first transition.The ideal location of the first code transition is located\nat 1/2 LSB above V\nSS. 4.8 Gain Error\nGain error determines the amount of deviation from theideal slope of the A/D converter transfer function.\nBefore the gain error is determined, the offset error ismeasured and subtracted from the conversion result.\nThe gain error can then be determined by finding the\nlocation of the last code transition and comparing that\nlocation to the ideal location. The ideal location of the\nlast code transition is 1.5 LSBs below full-scale or V\nDD.\n4.9 Conversion Current (IDD)\nConversion current is the average amount of current\nover the time required to perform a 12-bit conversion. \n4.10 Active Bus Current (IDDA)\nThe average amount of current  over the time required\nto monitor the I2C bus. Any current that the device con-\nsumes while it is not being addressed is referred to asActive Bus current.\n4.11 Standby Current (IDDS)\nThe average amount of current required while no con-\nversion is occurring and no data is being output (i.e.,\nSCL and SDA lines are quiet).\n4.12 I2C Standard Mode Timing\nI2C specification where the frequency of SCL is\n100 kHz.\n4.13 I2C Fast Mode Timing\nI2C specification where the frequency of SCL is\n400 kHz.\nMCP3221\nDS20001732E-page 16 \uf0e3 2002-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.5.0 SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS\n5.1 I2C Bus Characteristics\nThe following bus protocol are defined:\n• Data transfer may be init iated only when the bus \nis not busy.\n• During data transfer, the data line must remain \nstable whenever the clock line is high. Changes in \nthe data line while the clock line is high will be \ninterpreted as a Start or Stop condition.\nAccordingly, the following bus conditions are defined\n(refer to Figure 5-1 ).\n5.1.1 BUS NOT BUSY (A)\nBoth data and clock lines remain high.\n5.1.2 START DATA TRANSFER (B)\nA high-to-low transition of the SDA line while the clock\n(SCL) is high determines a Start condition. All\ncommands must be preceded by a Start condition.\n5.1.3 STOP DATA TRANSFER (C)\nA low-to-high transition of the SDA line while the clock\n(SCL) is high determines a Stop condition. All\noperations must be ended with a Stop condition.\n5.1.4 DATA VALID (D)\nThe state of the data line represents valid data when\nafter a START condition, the data line is stable for the\nduration of the high period of the clock signal.\nThe data on the line must be changed during the low\nperiod of the clock signal. There is one clock pulse perbit of data.Each data transfer is initia ted with a Start condition and\nterminated with a Stop condition. The number of  databytes being transferred between the Start and Stop\nconditions is determined by  the master device and is\nunlimited.\n5.1.5 ACKNOWLEDGE\nEach receiving device, when addressed, is obliged togenerate an Acknowledge bit after the reception ofeach byte. The master devi ce must generate an extra\nclock pulse that is associat ed with this Acknowledge\nbit.\nThe device that acknowledges has to pull down the\nSDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse in such a\nway that the SDA line is stable low during the high\nperiod of the acknowledge-related clock pulse. Setupand hold times must be taken into account. During\nreads, a master device must signal an end of data to\nthe slave by not generating an Acknowledge bit on thelast byte that is clocked out of the slave (NAK). In this\ncase, the slave (MCP3221) releases the bus to allow\nthe master device to g enerate the Stop condition.\nThe MCP3221 supports a bidirectional, 2-wire bus and\ndata transmission protocol. The device that sends data\nonto the bus is the transmitter and the device receiving\ndata is the receiver. The bus has to be controlled by amaster device that generates  the serial clock (SCL),\ncontrols the bus access and generates the Start and\nStop conditions, whereas the MCP3221 works as aslave device. Both master and slave devices can oper-\nate as either transmitter or receiver, but the master\ndevice determines which mode is activated.\nFIGURE 5-1: Data Transfer Sequence on the Serial Bus.SCL\nSDA(A) (B) (D) (D) (A) (C)\nSTART\nCONDITIONADDRESS OR\nACKNOWLEDGE\nVALIDDATA\nALLOWED\nTO CHANGESTOP\nCONDITION\n\uf0e3 2002-2017 Microchip Technology Inc. DS20001732E-page 17MCP3221\n5.2 Device Addressing\nThe address byte is the first byte received following the\nStart condition from the master  device. The first part of\nthe control byte consists of  a 4-bit device code, which\nis set to 1001  for the MCP3221. The device code is fol-\nlowed by three address bits: A2, A1 and A0. The default\naddress bits are 101. Contact the Microchip factory for\nadditional address bit options. The address bits allow\nup to eight MCP3221 devices on the same bus and areused to determine which device is accessed.\nThe eighth bit of the slave address determines if the\nmaster device wants to read conversion data or write to\nthe MCP3221. When set to a 1, a read operation is\nselected. When set to a 0, a write operation is selected.\nThere are no writable registers on the MCP3221, there-\nfore, this bit must be set to a 1 to initiate a conversion. \nThe MCP3221 is a slave device that is compatible with\nthe 2-wire I\n2C serial interface protocol. A hardware\nconnection diagram is shown in Figure 6-2 . Communi-\ncation is initiated by the microcontroller (masterdevice), which sends a Start bit followed by the address\nbyte.\nOn completion of the conversion(s) performed by the\nMCP3221, the microcontroller must send a Stop bit toend the communication.\nThe last bit in the devic e address byte is the R/W\n bit.\nWhen this bit is a logic 1, a conversion is executed. Set-\nting this bit to logic 0 also results in an Acknowledge\n(ACK) from the MCP3221, with the device then releas-\ning the bus. This can be used for device polling. Refer\nto Section 6.3 “Device Polling”  for more information.\nFIGURE 5-2: Device Addressing.5.3 Executing a Conversion \nThis section describes the details of communicating\nwith the MCP3221 device. Initiating the sample and\nhold acquisition, reading the conversion data, andexecuting multiple conversions are discussed.\n5.3.1 INITIATING THE SAMPLE AND \nHOLD\nThe acquisition and conversion of the input signal\nbegins with the falling edge of the R/W  bit of the\naddress byte. At this point, the internal clock initiates\nthe sample, hold and conversion cycle, all of which areinternal to the ADC.\nFIGURE 5-3: Initiating the Conversion, \nAddress Byte.\nFIGURE 5-4: Initiating the Conversion, \nContinuous Conversions.START READ/WRITE\nSLAVE ADDRESS R/W A\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1\nAddress bits(1)\n      Note 1 : Contact Microchip for additional address bits.Device code123456789 SCL\nSDA1 0 0 1 A2 A1 A0 R/W\nACK\nStart\nbitAddress Byte\nAddress bits Device bits tACQ + tCONV  is\ninitiated here \nSCL\nSDA D3 D2 D2\nACKLower Data Byte (n)tACQ + tCONV  is\ninitiated here \nD6 D5 D4 D0D7ACKD817 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\nMCP3221\nDS20001732E-page 18 \uf0e3 2002-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.The input signal is initially sampled with the first falling\nedge of the clock following the transmission of alogic-high R/W\n bit. Additionally, with the rising edge of\nthe SCL, the ADC transmits an Acknowledge bit (ACK\n= 0). The master must release the data bus during this\nclock pulse to allow the MCP3221 to pull the line low\n(refer to Figure 5-3 ).\nFor consecutive samples, sampling begins on the fall-\ning edge of the LSB of the conversion result, which is\ntwo bytes long. Refer to Figure 5-6  for the timing\ndiagram.5.3.2 READING THE CONVERSION DATA\nAfter the MCP3221 acknowledges the address byte, thedevice transmits four 0 bits followed by the upper four\ndata bits of the conversion. The master device  acknowl-\nedges this byte with an ACK = Low. With the  following\neight clock pulses, the MCP3221 transmits the lower\neight data bits from the conversion. The master sends\nan ACK = high, indicating to the MCP3221 that no moredata is requested. The master can send a Stop bit to\nend the transmission.\nFIGURE 5-5: Executing a Conversion.\n5.3.3 CONSECUTIVE CONVERSIONS\nFor consecutive samples, sampling begins on the fall-\ning edge of the LSB of the conversion result.

DS20001732E-page 19MCP3221\n6.0 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n6.1 Driving the Analog Input\nThe MCP3221 has a single-ended analog input (AIN).\nFor proper conversion results, the voltage at the AIN pin\nmust be kept between VSS and VDD. If the converter\nhas no offset error, gain error, INL or DNL errors, and\nthe voltage level of AIN is equal to or less than\nVSS + 1/2 LSB, the resultant code is 000h . Addition-\nally, if the voltage at AIN is equal to or greater than\nVDD - 1.5 LSB, the output code is FFFh .The analog input model is shown in Figure 6-1 . In this\ndiagram, the source impedance (RSS) adds to the inter-\nnal sampling switch (RS) impedance, directly affecting\nthe time required to charge the capacitor (CSAMPLE ).\nConsequently, a larger source impedance increasesthe offset error, gain error and integral linearity errors of\nthe conversion. Ideally, th e impedance of the signal\nsource should be near zero. This is achievable with an\noperational amplifier such as the MCP6022, which has\na closed-loop output im pedance of tens of ohms.\nFIGURE 6-1: Analog Input Model, AIN.\n6.2 Connecting to the I2C Bus\nThe I2C bus is an open collector bus, requiring pull-up\nresistors connected to the SDA and SCL lines. Thisconfiguration is shown in Figure 6-2 .\nFIGURE 6-2: Pull-up Resistors on I2C \nBus.The number of devices connected to the bus is only\nlimited  by the maximum bus capacitance of 400 pF.

The MCP3221\nacknowledges by pulling SDA low during the ACK clock\nand then release the bus back to the I2C master. A Stop\nor repeated Start bit can be i ssued from the master and\nI2C communication can continue.\nFIGURE 6-4: Device Polling.\n6.4 Device Power and Layout \nConsiderations\n6.4.1 POWERING THE MCP3221 \nVDD supplies the power to the device and the reference\nvoltage. A bypass capacitor value of 0.1 µF is recom-\nmended. Adding a 10 µF capacitor in parallel is recom-\nmended to attenuate higher frequency noise that is\npresent in some systems.\nFIGURE 6-5: Powering the MCP3221 .6.4.2 LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS\nWhen laying out a printed circuit board for use with\nanalog components, care should be taken to reducenoise wherever possible. A bypass capacitor from \nVDD\nto ground must  be used always with this device andplaced as close as possible to the device pin. A bypass\ncapacitor value of 0.1 µF is recommended.\nDigital and analog traces should be separated as much\nas possible on the board, with no traces runningunderneath the device or the bypass capacitor. Extra\nprecautions should be taken to keep traces with high-\nfrequency signals (such as clock lines) as far aspossible from analog traces.\nUse of an analog ground plane is recommended in\norder to keep the ground potential the same for all\ndevices on the board. Providing V\nDD connections to\ndevices in a Star configuration can also reduce noise\nby eliminating current return paths and associated\nerrors ( Figure 6-6 ). For more informa tion on layout tips\nwhen using the MCP3221 or other ADC devices, refer\nto the Microchip Technology Application Note, “ AN688\nLayout Tips for 12-Bit A/D Converter Application”(DS00688).\nFIGURE 6-6: VDD traces arranged in a \nStar configuration in order to reduce errors caused by current return paths.\nNote: When power-down of the MCP3221 is\nneeded during applications (after power-\nup), it is highly recommended to bring\ndown the VDD to VSS level. This can guar-\nantee a Full Reset of the device for the\nnext power-up cycle.1234567 89 SCL\nSDA100 1A2 A1A0 0\nACK\nStart\nbitAddress Byte\nAddress bits Device bits R/W Start\nbit\nMCP3221  response  \nVDD\nVDD\nAINSCL\nSDATo\nMicrocontroller10 µF\nMCP32210.1 µFVDD\nRPU RPUVDD\nConnection\nDevice 1\nDevice 2Device 3Device 4\n\uf0e3 2002-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.
