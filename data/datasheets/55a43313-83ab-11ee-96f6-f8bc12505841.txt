This device can handle both \ndigital and analog signals, and can transmit signals \nup to V CC in either direction. The TS3A27518E has \ntwo control pins, each controlling three 1:2 muxes \nat the same time, and an enable pin that put all \noutputs in high-impedance mode. The control pins \nare compatible with 1.8 V logic thresholds and are \nbackward compatible with 2.5 V and 3.3 V logic \nthresholds.\nThe TS3A27518E allows any SD, SDIO, and \nmultimedia card host controllers to expand out to \nmultiple cards or peripherals because the SDIO \ninterface consists of 6-bits: CMD, CLK, and Data[0:3] \nsignals. This device will support other 6-bit interfaces \nsuch a qSPI. The TS3A27518E has two control pins \nthat give additional flexibility to the user. For example, \nthe ability to mux two different audio-video signals \nin equipment such as an LCD television, an LCD \nmonitor, or a notebook docking station.\nDevice Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTS3A27518EWQFN (24) 4.00 mm × 4.00 mm\nTSSOP (24) 7.90 mm × 6.60 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nProcessor\nGNDVDDVDD VI/O\nControl \nlogicIN2\nGNDJTAG \nDEBUG, \nSPI, GPIO COM1RAM\nCPU\nPeripherals0.1µF\nENNO1 \nNO2\nNO3\nNO4 qSPI \nDevice #1\nSIO0 \nSIO1\nSIO2\nSIO3NO5\nNO6 SLCK\nCS\nNC1 \nNC2\nNC3\nNC4 qSPI \nDevice #2\nSIO0 \nSIO1\nSIO2\nSIO3NC5\nNC6 SLCK\nCSCOM2\nCOM3\nCOM4\nCOM5\nCOM6\nIN1\nTypical ApplicationTS3A27518E\nSCDS260F  – MARCH 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

This parameter is measured under the specified range of conditions and by the propagation \ndelay between the digital control (IN) signal and analog output (NC or NO) signal when the switch is turning ON.\ntOFFTurnoff time for the switch. This parameter is measured under the specified range of conditions and by the propagation \ndelay between the digital control (IN) signal and analog output (NC or NO) signal when the switch is turning OFF.\nQCCharge injection is a measurement of unwanted signal coupling from the control (IN) input to the analog (NC or NO) \noutput. This is measured in coulomb (C) and measured by the total charge induced due to switching of the control input. \nCharge injection, Q C = C L × ΔV COM, CL is the load capacitance, and ΔV COM is the change in analog output voltage.\nCNC(OFF) Capacitance at the NC port when the corresponding channel (NC to COM) is OFF.\nCNC(ON) Capacitance at the NC port when the corresponding channel (NC to COM) is ON.\nCNO(OFF) Capacitance at the NC port when the corresponding channel (NO to COM) is OFF.\nCNO(ON) Capacitance at the NC port when the corresponding channel (NO to COM) is ON.\nCCOM(OFF) Capacitance at the COM port when the corresponding channel (COM to NC) is OFF.\nCCOM(ON) Capacitance at the COM port when the corresponding channel (COM to NC) is ON.\nCI Capacitance of control input (IN, EN).\nOISOOFF isolation of the switch is a measurement of OFF-state switch impedance. This is measured in dB in a specific \nfrequency, with the corresponding channel (NC to COM) in the OFF state.\nXTALKCrosstalk is a measurement of unwanted signal coupling from an ON channel to an OFF channel (NC1 to NO1). Adjacent \ncrosstalk is a measure of unwanted signal coupling from an ON channel to an adjacent ON channel (NC1 to NC2). This is \nmeasured in a specific frequency and in dB.\nBW Bandwidth of the switch. This is the frequency in which the gain of an ON channel is –3 dB below the DC gain.\nTHDTotal harmonic distortion describes the signal distortion caused by the analog switch. This is defined as the ratio of \nroot mean square (RMS) value of the second, third, and higher harmonic to the absolute magnitude of the fundamental \nharmonic.\nICC Static power-supply current with the control (IN) pin at V CC or GND.www.ti.comTS3A27518E\nSCDS260F – MARCH 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TS3A27518E\nΩ\nIN\n++VCCFigure 7-1.

This device can handle both digital and analog signals, and can transmit signals up to V CC in either \ndirection. The TS3A27518E has two control pins, each controlling three 1:2 muxes at the same time, and an \nenable pin that puts all outputs in high-impedance mode. The control pins are compatible with 1.8-V logic \nthresholds and are backward compatible with 2.5-V and 3.3-V logic thresholds.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVCC\nIN2\nGNDNC1\nNO1\nCOM1\nNC2\nNO2\nCOM2\nNC3\nNO3\nCOM3NC4\nNO4\nCOM4\nNC5\nNO5\nCOM5\nNC6\nNO6\nCOM6IN1\nENLogic\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe isolation in power-down mode, V CC = 0 feature places all switch paths in high-impedance state (High-Z) \nwhen the supply voltage equals 0 V.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe TS3A27518E is a bidirectional device that has two sets of three single-pole double-throw switches.\nTwo digital signals control the 6 channels of the switch; one digital control for each set of three single-pole,\ndouble-throw switches. Digital input pin IN1 controls switches 1, 2, and 3, while pin IN2 controls switches 4, 5, \nand 6.\nThe TS3A27518 has an EN pin that when set to logic high, it places all channels into a high-impedance or \nHIGH-Z state.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe switches are bidirectional, so the NO, NC, and COM pins can be used as either inputs or outputs. This \nfunctionality allows port expansion to support many different types of bidirectional signal inferfaces such as SD, \nSDIO, GPIO, MMC, and qSPI.\n9.2 Typical Application\nSD/MMC Memory\nCard\nSDIO Peripheral\n(Bluetooth, WLAN,\nDTV, etc)Digital Baseband or\nApps ProcessorCOM1\nCOM2\nCOM3\nCOM4\nCOM5\nCOM6\nIN1, IN2, ENNC1\nNO1\nNC2\nNC3\nNC4\nNC5\nNC6NO2\nNO3\nNO4\nNO5\nNO6\nTS3A27518VCCVCCVCC\nVCCSDIO Port\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 9-1.

However, TI recommends \nconnecting unused pins to the ground through a 50- Ω resistor to prevent signal reflections back into the \ndevice. TI also recommends that the digital control pins (INX) be pulled up to V CC or down to GND to avoid \nundesired switch positions that could result from the floating pin. Refer to the Enabling SPI-Based Flash Memory \nExpansion by Using Multiplexers  application brief  for more information on using switches and multiplexers for \nSPI protocol expansion.\nFor the RTW package, connect the thermal pad to ground.\n9.2.3 Application Curve\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\nCOM Voltage, V (V)COM01234567\nON-State Resistance,r ( )ON/c87\n85ºC\n25ºC\n–40ºC\nFigure 9-3.

Do not exceed the absolute maximum \nratings, because stresses beyond the listed ratings can cause permanent damage to the device. Always \nsequence V CC on first, followed by NO, NC, or COM. Although it is not required, power-supply bypassing \nimproves noise margin and prevents switching noise propagation from the V CC supply to other components. A \n0.1-μF capacitor is adequate for most applications, if connected from V CC to GND.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo ensure reliability of the device, TI recommends following these common printed-circuit board layout \nguidelines:\n•Bypass capacitors should be used on power supplies, and should be placed as close as possible to the V CC \npin\n•Short trace-lengths should be used to avoid excessive loading\n•For the RTW package, connect the thermal pad to ground\n11.2 Layout Example\n0603 Cap= VIA to GND Plane\nNO2To System\nYou may ground the\nN.C pin or not\ninclude a trace\nIN2 NO3COM5NO1COM6IN1 NC3 NC6 N.C.
