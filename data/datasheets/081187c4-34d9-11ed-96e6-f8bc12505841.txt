#### Description:
The Molex 53649-0874 is a SlimStack Board-to-Board Connector designed for applications requiring a compact and efficient connection between printed circuit boards (PCBs). It features a fine pitch of 0.635mm and is available in two mated heights (9.00mm and 15.00mm) with a width of 6.40mm. The connector is constructed from high-temperature thermoplastic resin and utilizes copper alloy for the metal components, with gold plating on the mating surfaces and tin plating on the termination.

#### Typical Applications:
This connector is primarily used in board-to-board applications where space is limited and a reliable electrical connection is essential. Typical applications include:
- Consumer electronics
- Telecommunications equipment
- Computer hardware
- Industrial automation systems
- Any application requiring signal transmission between PCBs

The SlimStack connector is particularly suited for environments where durability and a high number of mating cycles (up to 50) are required, making it ideal for both commercial and industrial applications.
