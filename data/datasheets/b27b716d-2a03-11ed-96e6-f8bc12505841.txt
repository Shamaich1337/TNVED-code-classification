It features  \ntrue single-supply operation, low power consumption, and  \nrail-to-rail output. The outputs remain stable with capacitive loads of over 500 pF; the supply current is less than 630 μA/amp. Applications for the AD862x include photodiode transimpedance amplification, ATE reference level drivers, battery management, both line powered and portable instrumentation, and remote sensor signal conditioning, which includes automotive sensors. \nThe AD862x’s ability to swing nearly rail-to-rail at the input  \nand rail-to-rail at the output enables it to be used to buffer CMOS DACs, ASICs, and other wide output swing devices in \nsingle-supply systems. The 5 MHz bandwidth and low offset are ideal for precision filters. \nThe AD862x is fully specified over the industrial temperature \nrange. (−40°C to +85°C). The AD8627 is available in both  \n5-lead SC70 and 8-lead SOIC surface-mount packages (SC70 \npackaged parts are available in tape and reel only). The AD8626 is available in MSOP and SOIC packages, while the AD8625 is \navailable in TSSOP and SOIC packages. \n \n \nAD8625/AD8626/AD8627 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

It has true single -supply capability and has  \nan input voltage range that extends below the negative rail, \nallowing the part  to accommodate input signals below ground. \nThe rail -to-rail output of the AD862x provides the maximum \ndynamic range in many applications. To provide a low offset, low noise, high impedance input stage, the AD862x uses  \nn-channel JFETs. The input common -mode voltage extends \nfrom 0.2 V below – V\nS to 2 V below +V S. Driving the input of \nthe amplifier, configured in the unity gain buffer, closer than  \n2 V to the positive rail causes an increase in common -mode \nvoltage error, as illustrated in Figure 15, and a loss of amplifier \nbandwidth. This loss of bandwidth causes the rounding of the \noutput waveforms shown in Figure 39 and Figure 40, which \nhave inputs that are 1 V and 0 V fro m +V S, respectively.  \nThe AD862x does not experience phase reversal with input \nsignals close to the positive rail, as shown in Figure 29. For \ninput voltages greater than +V SY, a resistor in series with the \nAD862x’s noninverting input prevents phase reversal at the \nexpense of greater input voltage noise. This current -limiting \nresistor should also be used if there is a possibility of the input \nvoltage exceeding the positive supply by more than 300 mV , or if an input voltage is appl ied to the AD862x when ± V\nSY = 0. \nEither of these conditions damages the amplifier if the \ncondition exists for more than 10 seconds. A 10  kΩ resistor \nallows the amplifier to withstand up to 10 V of continuous \novervoltage, while increasing the input voltage noise by a negligible amount.

Gain -of-Two Inverter Response to 20 mV Step,  \nCentered 20 mV below Ground  \nThe AD862x is designed for 16 nV/√Hz wideband input voltage noise and maintains low noise performance to low frequencies, as shown in Figure 35. This noise performance, along with the \nAD862x’s low input current and current nois e, means that the \nAD862x contributes negligible noise for applications with large source resistances.  \nThe AD862x has a unique bipolar rail -to-rail output stage that \nswings within 5 mV of the rail when up to 2 mA of current is drawn. At larger loads, the dr op-out voltage increases, as shown \nin Figure 17 and Figure 18. The AD862x’s wide bandwidth and \nfast slew rate allows it to be used with faster signals than older  \nsingle -supply JFETs. Figure 44 shows the response of the \nAD862x, configured in unity gain, to a V\nIN of 20 V p -p at  \n50 kHz.

F | Page 15 of 20 MINIMIZING INPUT CUR RENT  \nThe AD862x is guaranteed to 1 pA maximum input current \nwith a ±13 V supply voltage at room temperature. Careful \nattention to how the amplifier is used maintains or possibly \nbetters this performance. The amplif ier’s operating temperature \nshould be kept as low as possible. Like other JFET input ampli -\nfiers, the AD862x’s input current doubles for every 10° C rise in \njunction temperature, as illustrated in Figure 8. On -chip power \ndissipa tion raises the device operating temperature, causing an \nincrease in input current. Reducing supply voltage to cut power dissipation reduces the AD862x’s input current. Heavy output loads can also increase chip temperature; maintaining a minimum load resis tance of 1 kΩ is recommended.  \nThe AD862x is designed for mounting on PC boards. Main -\ntaining picoampere resolution in those environments requires  \na lot of care. Both the board and the amplifier’s package have finite resistance. Voltage differences between  the input pins and \nother pins, as well as PC board metal traces may cause parasitic currents larger than the AD862x’s input current, unless special \nprecautions are taken. To ensure the best result, refer to the ADI \nwebsite for proper board layout seminar materials. Two \ncommon methods of minimizing parasitic leakages that should be used are guarding of the input lines and maintaining adequate insulation resistance.  \nContaminants, such as solder flux on the board’s surface and the amplifier’s package, can gre atly reduce the insulation \nresistance between the input pin and traces with supply or signal voltages. Both the package and the board must be kept \nclean and dry.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n PHOTODIODE PREAMPLIF IER APPLICATION  \nThe low input current and offset voltage levels of the AD862x, \ntogether with its low voltage noise, make this amplifier an \nexcellent choice for preamplifiers used in sensitive photodiode \napplications. In a typical photovoltaic preamp circuit, shown in Figure 45, the output of the amplifier is equal to  \nf p f OUT (P)RR ) ID(R V −=−=  \nwhere:  \nID = photodiode signal current (A).  \nRp = photodiode sensitivity (A/W).  \nRf = value of the feedback resistor, in Ω . \nP = light power incident to photodiode surface, in W .  \nThe amplifier’s input current, IB, contributes an output voltage \nerror proportional to the value of the feedback resistor. The offset voltage error, V\nOS, causes a small current error due to the \nphotodiode’s finite shunt resistance, R D. \nThe resulting output voltage error, V E, is equal to  \n)(IR VRR\nVB f OS\nDf\nE +\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb+=1   \nA shunt resistance on the order of 100 M Ω is typical for a small \nphotodiode. Resistance R D is a junction resistance that typically \ndrops by a factor of two for every 10 °C rise in temperature. In \nthe AD862x, both the offset voltage and drift are low, which helps minimize these errors. With I\nB values of 1 pA and V OS of \n50 mV , V E for Figure 45 is very negligible. Also, the circuit in \nFigure 45 results in an SNR value of 95 dB for a signal bandwidth  \nof 30 kHz.  \n03023-044RD\n100MΩC4\n15pFIB IBVOSCF\n5pF\nRF\n1.5MΩ\nOUTPUT\nAD8627PHOTODIODE\n \nFigure 45.

F | Page 16 of 20 OUTPUT AMPLIFIER FOR  DAC s \nMany system designers use amplifiers as buffers on the output \nof amplifiers to increase the DAC’s output driving capability. The high resolution current output DACs need high precision amplifiers on their output as current -to-voltage converters \n(I/V). Additionally, many DACs operate with a single supply of \n5 V . In a single -supply application, selection of a suitable op \namp may be more difficult because the output swing of the \namplifier do es not usually include the negative rail, in this case \nAGND. This can result in some degradation of the DAC’s specified performance, unless the application does not use codes near zero. The selected op amp needs to have very low offset voltage —for a 14 -bit DAC, the DAC LSB is 300  µV with a \n5 V reference —to eliminate the need for output offset trims. \nInput bias current should also be very low because the bias current multiplied by the DAC output impedance (about 10 k Ω \nin some cases) adds to the zero -code err or. Rail -to-rail input and \noutput performance  is desired. For fast settling, the slew rate of \nthe op amp should not impede the settling time of the DAC. Output impedance of the DAC is constant and code independent, but in order to minimize gain errors, the  input \nimpedance of the output amplifier should be as high as possible. The AD862x, with a very high input impedance, I\nB of 1 pA,  \nand a fast slew rate, is an ideal amplifier for these types of applications. A typical configuration with a popular DAC is \nshown in Figure 46. In these situations, the amplifier adds \nanother time constant to the system, increasin g the settling time \nof the output. The AD862x, with 5  MHz of BW , helps in \nachieving a faster effective settling time of the combined DAC \nand amplifier.  \nIn applications with full 4 -quadrant multiplying capability or a \nbipolar output swing, the circuit in Figure 47 can be used. In \nthis circuit, the first and second amplifiers provide a total gain of 2, which increases the output  voltage span to 20 V . Biasing \nthe external amplifier with a 10 V offset from the reference \nvoltage results in a full 4 -quadrant multiplying circuit.  \n03023-045AD5551/AD5552AD8627\nDGND\n*AD5552 ONLYVDD VREFF * VREFS *\nOUT\nSCLKDINCS\nAGND5V 2.5V\nUNIPOLAR\nOUTPUT\nLDAC*0.1µF10µF\n0.1µF\nSERIAL\nINTERFACE5V\n \nFigure 46.

F | Page 17 of 20 EIGHT -POLE SALLEN KEY LOW -PASS FILTER  \nThe AD862x’s high input impedance and dc precision make it a \ngreat selection for active filters. Due to the very low bias current \nof the AD862x, high value resistors can  be used to construct low \nfrequency filters. The AD862x’s picoamp -level input currents \ncontribute minimal dc errors. Figure 49 shows an example of a \n10 Hz, 8- pole Sallen Key filter constructed using the AD862x. \nDifferent numbers of the AD862x can be used d epending on \nthe desired response, which is shown in Figure 48. The high \nvalue used for R1 minimizes interaction with signal source resistance. Pole placement in this version of the filter minimizes the Q associated with the lower pole section of the filter. This \neliminates any peaking of the noise contribution of resistors in \nthe preceding sections, minimizing the inherent output voltage \nnoise of the filter.  \n03023-047V2V4\nV3\nV1\nFREQUENCY (Hz)VOLTAGE (V)\n0.100.40.81.2\n1 10 100 1k\n \nFigure 48.
