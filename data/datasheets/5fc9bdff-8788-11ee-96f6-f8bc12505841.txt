When there is no large input signal present, the impedance of the limiter diode is at its maximum, which produces minimum insertion loss, typically less than 0.1 dB. The presence of a large input signal temporarily forces the impedance of the diode to a much lower value, which produces an impedance mismatch that reflects the majority of the input signal power back towards its source. \nDuring the limiting process, a DC current is generated by the \nPIN limiter diode. The current is not the result of rectification, but is the result of charge carriers being forced into the I layer by the forward alternations of the large input signal. A complete path must be provided for this current or the diode is not capable of limiting. Therefore, an RF choke or similar structure must be provided to complete the path for DC current flow.  \nThe DC block capacitors shown in Figure 2 are optional; they \nprotect the limiter diode from external DC voltage that may be present in the source or load circuits. \nA cross section of the suggested printed circuit board design is \nshown in Figure 3. The via shown in this view is critical, both for electrical performance and for thermal performance. It is recommended that several vias should be placed under the entire footprint of the exposed paddle (pin 2) to minimize both electrical inductance to the system ground and thermal resistance to the system heat sink. \nFor more information about the operation of limiter diodes, refer \nto the Skyworks Application Note, PIN Limiter Diodes in \nReceiver Protectors , document number 200480.  \n \nLimiter\nPINRF\nChokeDC\nBlockDC\nBlock\nInput Output\n \nFigure 2.

Compared to other surface mount packages, the design of the QFN package produces lower thermal resistance and also reduces the effects of the parasitic inductance of the anode bond wires. \nA cross-sectional view of the CLA4607-085LF PIN limiter diode is \nshown in Figure 6. The cathode of the die is soldered directly to the top of the exposed paddle. This paddle is composed of copper, so its thermal resistance is very low.  \nThe copper ground paddle minimizes the total thermal resistance \nbetween the I layer, which is the location where most heat is generated under normal operation, and the surface to which the package is mounted. Minimal thermal resistance between the I layer and the external environment minimizes junction temperature. \nThe electrically equivalent circuit of the CLA4607-085LF PIN \nlimiter diode is shown in Figure 7. The inductances of pins 1 and 2, as well as the inductances of the bond wires are in series with the input and output transmission lines of the external circuit rather than the portion of the circuit that contains the shunt PIN limiter diode. \nAnode\n(Pin 1)Cathode\n(Pin 2) Anode\n(Pin 3) Encap sulated\nEpoxy Bond Wire\n(2 Place s)\nCLA4607-085LF Die\nNot to scale S1628b \nFigure 6.
