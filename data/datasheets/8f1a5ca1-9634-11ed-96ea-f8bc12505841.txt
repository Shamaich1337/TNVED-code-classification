It is \ndesigned for medical ultrasound applications, but can be used for other piezoelectric, \ncapaci tive or MEMS transducers.  \nThe device integrates a controller logic interface circuit (compatible with both 1.8 V and 3.3 V input signals), level translators, MOSFET gate drivers, noise blocking diodes, and high power P -channel and N -channel MOSFETs as the output stage for each channel. These \nMOSFETs are capable of providing more than 2 A of peak output current. Each channel has a dedicated bridge in order to reduce power dissipation and jitter during continuous \nwave mode (peak current is limited to 0.3 A). This CW bridge has dedicated power supplies \n(HV_CW) which are fully independent on the main HV supplies.  \nThese HV_CW supplies can be shorted to the HV supplies. The fundamental structure of \neach channel also consists of active clamping to ground circuitry,  anti-leakage and anti -\nmemory block, a thermal sensor to protect the device and an integrated TR -switch (just 8 Ω \nas equivalent resistor ) to connect the HV output to its LV output, guaranteeing strong decoupling during the transmission phase.  \nThe eight independent T/R switches can be used in both a dedicated RX chain per channel \nor in a multiplexing configuration.  \nThe clamp circuit has a current capability up to 2 A and works directly on the output pin, carrying this node exactly to zero. This feature allows minimized injection change during the transition from clamp to RX state.  \nIn addition, the STHV800 includes self -biasing circuitry which allows very low power \nconsumption during the RX phase (down to 200 µW global power dissipation) and thermal shutdow n block sensing by an external dedicated pin (THSD).  \nOne of the main benefits of this device is that it requires very few external components: only decoupling capacitors on the HV and LV supplies, and a resistor to pull up the THSD pin (moreover, this resistor can be shared by many devices).  \nEach channel is driven independently by only 2 digital bits, which in CW mode become one bit. An external clock can be used with the STHV800 to synchronize all the input signals. \nThis feature, however, is optional: if the CK pin is tied to ground the device works in \nasynchronous mode.  \n \n \n2/5 DocID026018 Rev 2  \n \nSTHV800  Description  \n \nFigure 1: STHV800 internal block diagram  \n \nFigure 2: XDCR output  in DUPLEX mode from single channel - PW and CW composition \nexample \n GN D _PW RLVOU T _8TX CW\nClamp\nTRswitchInp ut lo gic & h igh vol tagelevel sh ifte r\nNoise blocking\ndiodesAnti\nmemoryThermal\nsensorInputlogic&highvoltagelevelshifter\nClampTX CW\nTRswitchNoiseblocking\ndiodesThermal\nsensorAnti\nmemoryCHANNEL_1CHANNEL_2CHANNEL3CHANNEL_4CHANNEL5CHANNEL_6CHANNEL_7CHANNEL_8\nSelf voltage\nreference\nThermal\nprotectionH VP – 3 .3 VH VP_ C W – 3.3V\nH VM_ C W + 3 .3 VH VM + 3.3VLVOU T _ 1XD C R_ 8\nXD C R_ 1TH SDSTHV800\nIN8 _1\nIN1 _0IN1 _1\nC W\nC K\nVDD PD VD D A GN D\nD GN D\nVDDMH VP_ CWHV P H VM\nHVM _ C WVC C_ LV\n3.3VVC C_ H V_ C W\n0 to 90 VVC C_H V\n0 to 90 V\nVSS_H V_C W\n0 to -90 VVSS_H V\n0 to -90VVSS_ LV\n-3.3VC an be\nindependent\nor shorted\nC an be\nindependent\nor shortedf > 100 M H z1 .6V to 3.6V\nInput signal\nVC C_D IG\n1.8V or 3.3VVC C_ LV\n3.3V\nR p\n10 kΩ\nLN A\nCf\nCfCfCf\n DocID026018 Rev 2 3/5 \n \nRevision  history  STHV800  \n \n2 Revision history \nTable 2: Document revision history  \nDate  Revision Changes  \n21-Mar -2014 1 Initial release.  \n07-A pr-2014 2 C hanged order code from STHV800QTR to STHV800L in Table 1: \nDevice summary \n4/5 DocID026018 Rev 2 \nSTHV800   \n \n   \nPlease Read Carefully  \nInformation in this document is provided solely in connection with ST products.
