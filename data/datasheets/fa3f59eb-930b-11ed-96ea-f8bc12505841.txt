The ISL6131 is \nan undervoltage four-supply supervisor, and the ISL6132 is a two-voltage supervisor monitoring for undervoltage (UV) and \novervoltage (OV) conditions. \nBoth ICs feature four external resistor programmable voltage \nmonitoring (VMON) inputs, each with a related STATUS output \nthat individually reports the rela ted monitor input condition. In \naddition, there is a Power-Good (PGOOD) signal that asserts \nhigh when the STATUS outputs are in their correct state. A \nstability delay of approximately 160ms ensures that the \nmonitored supply is stable before STATUS and PGOOD are released to go high. The PGOOD and STATUS outputs are \nopen-drain to allow OR’ing of the signals and interfacing to a \nwide range of logic levels. \nSTATUS and PGOOD outputs are guaranteed to be valid with IC \nbias lower than 1V, eliminat ing concern about STATUS and \nPGOOD outputs during IC bias up and down. VMON inputs are designed to ignore momentary transients on the monitored \nsupplies.Features\n• Operates from 1.5V to 5.5V Supply Voltage\n• Four Adjustable Voltage Monitoring Thresholds \n• 150ms STATUS/PGOOD Stability Time Delay\n• Four Individual Open Drain STATUS Outputs• Guaranteed STATUS/PGOOD Valid to V\nDD <1V\n•VDD and VMON Glitch Immunity\n•VDD Lock-Out\n•4 m m  X  4 m m  Q F N  P a c k a g e\n- Compliant to JEDEC PUB95 MO-220\nQFN - Quad Flat No Leads - Package Outline\n- Near Chip Scale Package footprint, which improves PCB \nefficiency and has a thinner profile\n• Pb-Free (RoHS Compliant)\nApplications\n• Multivoltage DSPs and Processors\n• µP Voltage Monitoring\n• Embedded Control Systems•G r a p h i c s  C a r d s\n• Intelligent Instruments\n•M e d i c a l  E q u i p m e n t  \n• Network Routers\n• Portable Battery-Powered Equipment•S e t - T o p  B o x e s\n• Telecommunications Systems\nFIGURE 1.

Once biased to 1.5V, \nthe IC continuously monitors from one to four voltages \nindependently through external resistor dividers, comparing each \nvoltage monitoring (VMON) pin vo ltage to an internal 0.633V \n(VVMONvth ) reference.\nWith the EN input driven high or open, as each VMON input rises \nabove V VMONvth , a timer is set to ensure ~160ms of continuous \ncompliance. Then the related STATUS output is released to be pulled high. The STATUS outputs are open-drain to allow OR’ing of \nthese signals and interfacing to a logic high level up to V\nDD. The \nSTATUS outputs are designed to reject short transients (~30 \uf06ds) \non the VMON inputs. Once all STATUS outputs are high, a \nPower-Good (PGOOD) output signal is generated high to indicate \nthat all monitored voltages are greater than minimum compliance level. \nOnce any VMON input falls below V\nVMONvth for longer than the \nglitch filter time, both the PGOOD and the related STATUS output are pulled low. The other STATUS outputs remain high as long as \ntheir corresponding VMON voltage remains valid and the PGOOD \nvalidation process is reset. \nFigure 1 shows the ISL6131 typi cal application schematic, and \nFigure 3 is an operational timing diagram. See Figures 10 to 17 for \nISL6131 function and performance.  Figures 10 and 11 show the \nV\nDD rising along with STATUS and PGOOD response. Figures 12 \nand 13 illustrate VMON falling below V VMONvth , and Figure 14 \nshows VMON rising above V VMONvth with STATUS and PGOOD \nresponse. Figure 15 shows V DD failing, with STATUS and PGOOD \nresponse. Figures 16 and 17 show ENABLE to STATUS and PGOOD \ntiming.\nIf less than four voltages ar e being monitored, connect the \nunused VMON pins to V DD for proper operation. All unused \nSTATUS outputs can be left open. \nThe ISL6132 is a dual voltage monitor for undervoltage and \novervoltage compliance. Figure 2 shows the typical ISL6132 \nimplementation schematic, and Figu re 4 is the operational timing \ndiagram.\nThere are two pairs of monitors, each with an undervoltage \n(UVMON) input and an overvoltage (OVMON) input, along with associated STATUS and PGOOD outputs.\nUpon V\nDD bias power-up, the STATUS and PGOOD outputs are \nheld correctly low, once V DD is as low as 1V. Once biased to 1.5V, \nthe IC continuously monitors the voltage through external resistor \ndividers, comparing each VMON pi n voltage to an internal 0.633V \nreference. At proper bias, OVSTATUS is pulled high, and \nUVSTATUS and PGOOD are pulled low. Once the UVMON input > VMON Vth continuously for ~160ms, its associated \nSTATUS output releases high, indicating that the minimum \nvoltage condition has been met. As both UVMON and OVMON \ninputs are satisfied, the PGOOD ou tput is released to go high, \nindicating that the monitored voltage is within the specified window. Figure 18 shows this performance for a 4V to 5V \nwindow.\nWhen VMON does not satisfy its voltage high or low criteria for \nmore than the glitch filter time, the associated STATUS and \nPGOOD are pulled low. Figures 19 and 20 show this performance for a 4V to 5V compliant window.\nFigures 21 through 23 show the VMON glitch filter timing to \nSTATUS and PGOOD notification and transient immunity.\nThe ENABLE input, when pulled low, allows the monitoring and \nreporting functions to be disabled . Figure 24 shows ENABLE high \nto PGOOD timing for compliant voltage.\nWhen choosing resistors for the divider, remember to keep the \ncurrent through the string bounded by power loss tolerance at the \ntop end and noise immunity at the bottom end. For most applications, total divider resistance in the 10k \uf057 -100k\uf057\uf020range \nis advisable, with 1% tolerance resistors being used to reduce \nmonitoring error.\nFigures 1 and 2 show that choosing the two resistor values is \nstraightforward for the ISL6131, because the ratio of resistance \nshould equal the ratio of the desired trip voltage to the internal reference, 0.633V.\nFor the ISL6132, two dividers of two resistors each can be \nemployed to monitor the OV and UV levels for each voltage. Otherwise, use a single three-resist or string for each voltage. In \nthe three-resistor divider stri ng, the ratio of the desired \novervoltage trip point to the internal reference is equal to the ratio of the two upper resistors to the lowest (GND connected) \nresistor. The desired undervoltage trip point ratio to the internal \nreference voltage is equal to the ratio of the uppermost (voltage connected) resistor to the two lower resistors, as shown in the \nfollowing example:\n1. Establish lower and upper trip level: 3.3V ±20% or 2.64V (UV) \nand 3.96V (OV) \n2. Establish total resistor string value: 10k \uf057\uf02c\uf020Ir = divider current\n3. (Rm + Rl) * Ir = 0.623V @ UV and Rl * Ir = 0.633V @ OV\n4. Rm + Rl = 0.623V/Ir @ UV => Rm + Rl = \n0.623V/(2.64V/10k Ω) = 2.359k Ω\n5. Rl = 0.633V/Ir @ OV => Rl = 0.633V/(3.96V/10k Ω) = 1.598k Ω\n6. Rm = 2.359k Ω - 1.598k Ω = 0.761k Ω\n7. Ru = 10k Ω - 2.397k Ω = 7.641k Ω\nChoose standard value resistors that most clos ely approximate \nthese ideal values. Choosing a different total divider resistance \nvalue may yield a more ideal ratio with available resistors values .\nISL6131, ISL6132\nFN9119 Rev 6.00 Page 6 of 15\nFebruary 11, 2014FIGURE 3.

An OFF LED is \nthe PGOOD indicator for all four supplies. The ENABLE input enables or disables the voltage monitoring function. See Figures \n10 to 17 for performance and function examples.\nThe ISL6132EVAL1Z platform is set up to monitor and report \neither an undervoltage or an overvoltage condition on 5V and \n12V supplies to a ±10% tolerance. There is an OV and a UV \nSTATUS output for each of the two supplies and individual AND’ed PGOOD outputs when each voltage is within the \nprogrammed voltage range. An OFF LED indicates compliance to \nthe voltage range upper and lower limits.\nThe ENABLE inputs enable or disable the voltage monitoring \nfunctions for each monitor supply. \nSee Figures 18 to 24 for perf ormance and function examples. \nFigures 25 and 26 illustrat e the ISL6131EVAL1Z and \nISL6132EVAL1Z platforms respecti vely in image and schematic.\nUsing the ISL6131, ISL6132 for Negative \nVoltage Monitoring Applications\nThe ISL6131, ISL6132 can be used for -V monitoring because it \nmonitors any voltage that is more positive relative to its GND pin. \nWith correct bias differential, these parts can monitor any \nvoltage, regardless of polarity or amplitude.\nUsing the ISL6131 for “Lossless” Sequencing \nApplications\nThe ISL6131 can be used in a “l ossless” sequencing application \nin which a monitored output voltage determines the start of the \nnext sequenced turn-on. As show n in Figure 7, VMON_A input \nlooks at the common V IN of several DC-DC converters and \nenables DC-DC_A with STATUS _A, once both V IN and ENABLE are \nsatisfied. VMON_B monitors the output of DC-DC_A, and when the acceptable output voltage is  reached, DC-DC_B is enabled \nwith STATUS_B output. This sequ encing pattern continues until \nall DC-DC outputs are on, at which time PGOOD signal is \nreleased. A delay of 160ms from VMON > V\nVMONVth  to STATUS \nhigh ensures stability at each step prior to subsequent turn-on. \nAdditional ISL6131s can be employed in parallel to sequence any number of DC-DC convertors in this fashion.Using the ISL6131 for System Voltage and \nOver-Temperature Monitoring\nAs a multi-voltage monitoring  IC, the ISL6131 can monitor \nover-temperature as well as voltage for more complete coverage \nof system stability. Using a Negative Temperature Coefficient \n(NTC) passive device in place of one of the resistors in a VMON \ndivider provides over-temperature monitoring either locally or \nremotely. \nEvaluations of this application configuration have involved the \nQT0805T-202J, QT0805Y-502J and QT0805Y-103J NTCs from \nQuality Thermistor.\nISL6131 over-temperature monitoring is not as accurate as \nspecific temperature monitor ICs, but this implementation \nprovides a cost-efficient solution with 5% tolerances achievable.\nSee Figures 8 and 9 for over-temperature sensing configuration \nand operation results. In this example, the desired maximum \ntemperature is 100°C. The QT0805Y -103J NTC was placed at the \nend of 3 feet of twisted pair wire to emulate a remote sensing \napplication. According to the Qua lity Thermistor data sheet, this \nNTC device has a +25°C value of 10K and a +100°C value of 0.923K. An accompanying standard value resistor of 3.83K was \nchosen for the divider so that at 100°C, VMON ~0.633V with the \nbias voltage at 3.3V.\nThe resulting falling VMON trip  point with the configuration \nshown is ~0.634V, with ~0.642V for rising, which equates to \n~95°C for under-temperature and ~97°C for over-temperature, respectively. Choosing the standard resistor value above and \nbelow R1 allows for small adjustments in the temperature trip \npoint.FIGURE 7.
