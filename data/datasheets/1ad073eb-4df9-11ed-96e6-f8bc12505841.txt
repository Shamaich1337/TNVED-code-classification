Bothfeature slew-rate-limited drivers that minimize EMI andreduce reflections caused by improperly terminatedcables. Data rates are guaranteed up to 250kbps.\nThe MAX1482/MAX1483 draw only 20µA of supply cur-\nrent. Additionally, they have a low-current shutdownmode that consumes only 0.1µA. Both parts operatefrom a single +5V supply.\nDrivers are short-circuit current limited and are protect-\ned against excessive power dissipation by thermalshutdown circuitry that places the driver outputs into ahigh-impedance state. The receiver input has a fail-safefeature that guarantees a logic-high output if the inputis open circuit.\nThe MAX1482 is full duplex and the MAX1483 is half\nduplex. Both parts have a \n1⁄8-unit-load input impedance\nthat guarantees up to 256 transceivers on the bus.\n________________________Applications\nLow-Power RS-485/RS-422 Networks\nTransceivers for EMI-Sensitive ApplicationsIndustrial-Control Local Area NetworksLarge 256-Node LANs ____________________________Features\n♦Low 20µA Operating Current\n♦Slew-Rate Limited for Reduced EMI and\nReduced Reflections\n♦0.1µA Low-Current Shutdown Mode\n♦Designed for RS-485 and RS-422 Applications\n♦Operate from a Single +5V Supply\n♦-7V to +12V Common-Mode Input Voltage Range\n♦Allows up to 256 Transceivers on the Bus— \nGuaranteed ( 1⁄8-unit load)\n♦Current Limiting and Thermal Shutdown for\nDriver Overload ProtectionMAX1482/MAX148320µA, 1⁄8-Unit-Load, Slew-Rate-Limited\nRS-485 Transceivers\n________________________________________________________________ Maxim Integrated Products 1TOP VIEW\n1\n23\n48\n7\n6\n5VCC\nB\nA\nGND DIDERERO\nDIP/SOR\nD\n1\n23\n48\n7\n6\n5VCCA\nGND \nDE REB\nRO\nµMAXDIMAX1483_________________Pin Configurations\nMAX1483\nNOTE:  PIN LABELS Y AND Z ON TIMING, TEST, AND WAVEFORM  \n            DIAGRAMS REFER TO PINS A AND B WHEN DE IS HIGH.

The MAX1482and MAX1483 are specified for data rates of at least250kbps. The MAX1482 is a full-duplex transceiverwhile the MAX1483 is half duplex. When disabled, thedriver and receiver outputs are high impedance.\nThe 96k Ω, \n1/8-unit-load receiver input impedance of the\nMAX1482/MAX1483 allows up to 256 transceivers on abus, compared to the 1-unit load (12k Ωinput imped-\nance) of standard RS-485 drivers (32 transceivers max-imum). Any combination of MAX1482/MAX1483 andother RS-485 transceivers with a total of 32 unit loads orless can be put on the bus.Reduced EMI and Reflections\nThe MAX1482/MAX1483 are slew-rate limited, minimiz-ing EMI and reducing reflections caused by improperlyterminated cables. Figure 9 shows both the driver out-put waveform of a MAX1482/MAX1483 transmitting a125kHz signal and the Fourier analysis of that signal. \nHigh-frequency harmonics have much lower ampli-\ntudes, and the potential for EMI is significantly reduced.20µA, 1⁄8-Unit-Load, Slew-Rate-Limited\nRS-485 Transceivers\n8_______________________________________________________________________________________Figure 9.

The devices will not shut down unlessboth the driver and receiver are disabled.  In shut-\ndown, the devices typically draw only 0.1µA of supplycurrent.\nRE and DE may be driven simultaneously; the parts are\nguaranteed not to enter shutdown if RE is high and DEis low for less than 50ns. If the inputs are in this state forat least 600ns, the parts are guaranteed to enter shut-down.\nFor the receiver, the t\nZHand t ZLenable times assume\nthe part was not in the low-power shutdown state. Thet\nZH(SHDN) and t ZL(SHDN) enable times assume the\nparts were shut down (see Electrical Characteristics ).\nIt takes the receivers longer to become enabled from\nthe low-power shutdown state (t ZH(SHDN) , tZL(SHDN) )\nthan from the operating mode (t ZH, tZL). (The parts are\nin operating mode if the RE , DE inputs equal a logical0,1 or 1,1 or 0,0.)Driver Output Protection \nExcessive output current and power dissipation causedby faults or by bus contention are prevented by twomechanisms. A foldback current limit on the outputstage provides immediate protection against short cir-cuits over the whole common-mode voltage range (seeTypical Operating Characteristics ). In addition, a ther-\nmal shutdown circuit forces the driver outputs into ahigh-impedance state if the die temperature risesexcessively.\nPropagation Delay\nDigital encoding schemes depend on the driver andreceiver skew. Skew is defined as the differencebetween the rising and falling propagation delay times.Typical propagation delays are shown in Figures 11and 12 using Figure 10’s test circuit.\nThe difference in receiver delay times, | t\nPLH- tPHL|, is\ntypically under 160ns.\nThe driver skew times are typically 160ns (800ns max).MAX1482/MAX148320µA, 1⁄8-Unit-Load, Slew-Rate-Limited\nRS-485 Transceivers\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 9RO\n5V/divBA\n500mV/div\n500ns/div\nRO5V/divAB\n500mV/div\n500ns/div\nFigure 11.

For line lengths greater than 4000 feet, seeFigure 16.\nFigure 13 shows the system differential voltage for the\nparts driving 4000 feet of 26AWG twisted-pair wire at110kHz into 120 Ωloads. Even after 4000 feet of cable,\nthe MAX1482/MAX1483 output shows virtually no dis-tortion.\nTypical Applications\nThe MAX1482/MAX1483 transceivers are designed forbidirectional data communications on multipoint bustransmission lines. Figures 14 and 15 show typical net-work applications circuits. These parts can also beused as line repeaters, with cable lengths longer than4000 feet, as shown in Figure 16.\nTo minimize reflections, the line should be terminated at\nboth ends in its characteristic impedance, and stublengths off the main line should be kept as short aspossible (although the slew-rate-limited MAX1482 andMAX1483 are more tolerant of imperfect terminationthan standard RS-485 ICs).\nIsolated RS-485\nFor isolated RS-485 applications, see the MAX253 andMAX1480 data sheets.20µA, 1⁄8-Unit-Load, Slew-Rate-Limited\nRS-485 Transceivers\n10 ______________________________________________________________________________________DI RO DEREAB\nRE\nRE RERO\nRORODI\nDIDIDE\nDEDE\nD DD\nR RRB BB\nA A A120Ω 120Ω\nD\nR\nMAX1483\nFigure 14.

**Description:**
The MAX1482EPD+ is a low-power transceiver designed for RS-485 and RS-422 communication protocols. It features full-duplex operation, allowing simultaneous transmission and reception of data. The device is optimized for low power consumption, drawing only 20µA during operation and 0.1µA in shutdown mode. The MAX1482EPD+ is equipped with slew-rate limited drivers that help reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and signal reflections, making it suitable for long-distance communication.

**Typical Applications:**
The MAX1482EPD+ is commonly used in:
- Low-power RS-485/RS-422 networks
- Industrial control systems
- Local area networks (LANs) with up to 256 nodes
- EMI-sensitive applications where reduced noise is critical
- Data communication in harsh environments due to its wide operating temperature range

This component is ideal for applications requiring reliable data transmission over long distances while maintaining low power consumption and minimizing signal distortion.
