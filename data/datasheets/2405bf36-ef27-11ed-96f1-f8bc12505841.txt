The L TC2872 can be configured as four RS232 single-ended transceivers or two RS485 differential transceivers, or combinations of both, on shared I/O lines.  \nPin-controlled integrated termination resistors allow \nfor easy interface reconfiguration, eliminating external resistors and control relays. Half-duplex switches allow four-wire and two-wire RS485 configurations. Loopback mode steers the driver inputs to the receiver outputs for diagnostic self-test. The RS485 receivers support up to 256 nodes per bus, and feature full failsafe operation for floating, shorted or terminated inputs.\nAn integrated DC/DC boost converter uses a small induc-\ntor and one capacitor , eliminating the need for multiple supplies for driving RS232 levels.\nL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology, the Linear logo and µModule are registered trademarks of \nLinear Technology Corporation.

It can be powered from a single 3.0V to 5.5V supply with optional logic interface supply as low as 1.7V . An integrated DC/DC converter provides the positive and negative supply rails needed for RS232 operation. Automatically selected integrated termination resistors for both RS232 and RS485 protocols are included, eliminating the need for external components and switching relays. Both parts include loopback control for self-test and debug as well as logically-switchable half- and full-duplex control of the RS485 bus interface.\nThe L TC2872 offers two ports that can be independently \nconfigured as either two RS232 receivers and drivers or one RS485/RS422 receiver and driver depending on the state of its 485/232 pins. Control inputs DXEN and RXEN provide independent control of driver and receiver opera-tion for either RS232 or RS485 transceivers, depending on the selected operating protocol.\nThe L TC2872 features rugged operation with an ESD rating \nof ±15kV HBM on the receiver inputs and driver outputs, both powered and unpowered. All other pins offer protec-tion exceeding ±4kV .\nDC/DC Converter\nThe on-chip DC/DC converter operates from the V\nCC input, \ngenerating a 7V V DD supply and a charge pumped –6.3V \nVEE supply, as shown in Figure 13. V DD and V EE power \nthe output stage of the RS232 drivers and are regulated \nto levels that guarantee greater than ±5V output swing. The DC/DC converter requires a 22µH inductor (L1) and a bypass capacitor (C4) of 2.2µF or larger . The charge pump capacitor (C1) is 470nF and the storage capacitors (C2 and C3) are 2.2µF . Larger storage capacitors up to 4.7µF may be used if C1 and C4 are scaled proportionately. Locate C1-C4 close to their associated pins. \nBypass capacitor C5 on the logic supply pin can be omitted \nif V\nL is connected to V CC. See the V L Logic Supply section \nfor more details about the V L logic supply.Inductor Selection\nAn inductor with a value of 22µH ±20% is required. It \nmust have a saturation current (I SAT) rating of at least \n200mA and a DCR (copper wire resistance) of less than 1.3Ω. Some small inductors meeting these requirements are listed in Table 10.  \nTable 10.

If V CC’s voltage is greater \nthan 4.5V and its rise time is faster than 10μs, the pins \nVDD and SW can exceed their Absolute Maximum values \nduring start-up. When supply voltage is applied to V CC, the \nvoltage difference between V CC and V DD generates inrush \ncurrent flowing through inductor L1 and capacitors C1 and C2. The peak inrush current must not exceed 2A. To avoid this condition, add a 1Ω resistor as shown in Figure 14. This precaution is not relevant for supply voltages below 4.5V or rise times longer than 10μs.by more than 1V for proper operation. Logic input pins do not have internal biasing devices to pull them up or down. They must be driven high or low to establish valid logic levels; do not float.\nRS485 Driver\nThe RS485 driver provides full RS485/RS422 compat-\nibility. When enabled, if DI is high, Y–Z is positive. When the driver is disabled, Y and Z output resistance is greater than 96k (typically 125k) to ground over the entire common mode range of –7V to 12V . This resistance is equivalent to the input resistance on these lines when the driver is configured in half-duplex mode and Y and Z act as the RS485 receiver inputs.\nDriver Overvoltage and Overcurrent Protection\nThe RS232 and RS485 driver outputs are protected from \nshort circuits to any voltage within the Absolute Maximum range ±15V .  The maximum current in this condition is 90mA for the RS232 driver and 250mA for the RS485 driver .  \nIf an RS485 driver output is shorted to a voltage greater \nthan V\nCC, when active high, positive current of about \n100mA can flow from the driver output back to V CC. If the \nsystem power supply or loading cannot sink this excess current, clamp V\nCC to GND with a Zener diode (e.g., 5.6V , \n1W , 1N4734) to prevent an overvoltage condition on V CC.\nAll devices also feature thermal shutdown protection that disables the drivers, receivers, and RS485 terminators  in case of excessive power dissipation (see Note 6).\nRS485 Balanced Receiver with Full Failsafe Support\nThe L TC2872 RS485 receiver has a differential threshold \nvoltage that is about 80mV for signals that are rising and –80mV for signals that are falling, as illustrated in  \nFigure 15. If a differential input signal lingers in the win-dow between these thresholds for more than about 2µs, the rising threshold changes from 80mV to –50mV , while the falling threshold remains at –80mV . Thus, differential inputs that are shorted, open, or terminated but not driven for more than 2µs produce a high on the receiver output, indicating a failsafe condition.applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 14. Supply Current Overshoot Protection \nfor Input Supplies of 4.5V of Higher\nVL Logic Supply\nA separate logic supply pin V L allows the L TC2872 to \ninterface with any logic signal from 1.7V to 5.5V . All logic \nI/Os use V L as their high supply. For proper operation, V L \nshould not be greater than V CC. During power-up, if V L \nis higher than V CC, the device will not be damaged, but \nbehavior of the device is not guaranteed. If V L is not con-\nnected to V CC, bypass V L with a 0.1µF capacitor .\nRS232 and RS485 driver outputs are undriven and the RS485 termination resistors are disabled when V\nL or V CC \nis grounded or V CC is disconnected.\nAlthough all logic input pins reference V L as their high \nsupply, they can be driven up to 7V , independent of V L and \nVCC, with the exception of FEN, which must not exceed V L 2872 F140V5V\n≤10µs\nC1\n470nFL1\n22µH\nINRUSH\nCURRENTC4\n2.2µFR11/uni03A91/8W\nV\nCC\nVDD GNDSW19 17CAP\n2021\n18\nC22.2µF\nLTC2872\n19\n2872fFigure 15. RS485 Receiver Input Threshold \nCharacteristics with Typical Values Shownapplica Tions inForMaTion\nThe benefit of this dual threshold architecture is that \nit supports full failsafe operation yet offers a balanced threshold, centered on 0V , for normal data signals. This balance preserves duty cycle for small input signals with heavily slewed edges, typical of what might be seen at the end of a very long cable. This performance is highlighted in Figure 16, where a signal is driven through 4000 feet of CAT5e cable at 3Mbps. Even though the differential signal peaks at just over 100mV and is heavily slewed, the output maintains a nearly perfect signal with almost no duty cycle distortion.lines, which establishes a logic-high state when all the transmitters on the network are disabled. The values of the biasing resistors depend on the number and type of transceivers on the line and the number and value of terminating resistors. Therefore, the values of the biasing resistors must be customized to each specific network installation, and may change if nodes are added to  or removed from the network. \nThe internal failsafe feature of the L TC2872 eliminates the \nneed for external network biasing resistors provided they are used in a network of transceivers with similar internal failsafe features. This also allows the network to support a high number of nodes, up to 256, by eliminating the bias resistor loading. The L TC2872 transceivers will operate correctly on biased, unbiased, or under-biased networks.\nReceiver Outputs\nThe RS232 and RS485 receiver outputs are internally \ndriven high (to V\nL) or low (to GND) with no external pull-up \nneeded.  When the receivers are disabled, the output pin becomes Hi-Z with leakage of less than ±5μA for voltages within the V\nL supply range.\nRS485 Receiver Input Resistance\nThe RS485 receiver input resistance from A or B to GND \n(Y or Z to GND in half-duplex mode with driver disabled) is greater than 96k (typically 125k) when the integrated termination is disabled. This permits up to a total of 256 receivers per system without exceeding the RS485 receiver loading specification. The input resistance of the receiver is unaffected by enabling/disabling the receiver or whether the part is in half-duplex, full-duplex, loopback mode, or even unpowered. The equivalent input resistance looking into the RS485 receiver pins is shown in Figure 17.\nFigure 16. A 3Mbps Signal Driven Down 4000ft of CAT5e \nCable. Top T races: Received Signals After T ransmission Through Cable; Middle T race: Math Showing Differences of Top T wo Signals; Bottom T race: Receiver Output\nAn additional benefit of the balanced architecture is excel-\nlent noise immunity due to the wide effective differential input signal hysteresis of 160mV for signals transitioning through the window region in less than 2μs. Increasingly slower signals will have increasingly less effective hyster -\nesis, limited by the DC failsafe hysteresis of about 30mV . \nRS485 Biasing Network Not Required\nRS485 networks are often biased with a resistive divider \nto generate a differential voltage of ≥200mV on the data 0.1V/DIV0.1V/DIV\n5V/DIV\n2872 F16200ns/DIV\nRA(A-B)AB\nFigure 17.

When the cable is not terminated with its characteristic impedance, reflections cause waveform distortion.\nThe L TC2872 offers integrated switchable 120Ω termination \nresistors between the differential receiver inputs and also between the differential driver outputs. This provides the advantage of being able to easily change, through logic control, the proper line termination for correct operation when configuring transceiver networks. Termination should be enabled on transceivers positioned at both ends of a network bus.\nTermination on the driver nodes is important for cases \nwhere the driver is disabled but there is communication on the connecting bus from another node. Driver termination across Y and Z can be disabled independently from the termination across A and B by setting DZ low. See Table 7  \nfor details.\nThe termination resistance is maintained over the entire \nRS485 common mode range of –7V to 12V as shown in Figure 18. The voltage across pins with the terminating resistor enabled should not exceed 6V as indicated in the Absolute Maximum Ratings table. \nFigure 18. Typical Resistance of the Enabled RS485 \nTerminator vs Common Mode Voltage of A and Bthe differential receiver inputs. With the H/F pin set to \na logic-high, the Y and Z pins serve as the differential inputs. In either configuration, the RS485 driver outputs are always on Y and Z. The impedance looking into the A and B pins is not affected by H/F control, including the differential termination resistance. The H/F control does not affect RS232 operation. \nLogic Loopback\nA loopback mode connects the driver inputs to the re-\nceiver outputs (noninverting) for self test. This applies to both RS232 and RS485 transceivers. Loopback mode is entered when the LB pin is set to a logic-high and the relevant receiver is enabled. \nIn loopback mode, the drivers function normally. They \ncan be disabled with output in a Hi-Z state or left enabled to allow loopback testing in normal operation. Loopback works in half- or full-duplex modes and does not affect the termination resistors.\nRS485 Cable Length vs Data Rate\nMany factors contribute to the maximum cable length \nthat can be used for for RS485 or RS422 communication, including driver transition times, receiver threshold, duty cycle distortion, cable properties and data rate. A typical curve of cable length versus maximum data rate is shown in Figure 19. Various regions of this curve reflect different performance limiting factors in data transmission.  \nFigure 19. Cable Length vs Data Rate (RS485/RS422 \nStandard Shown in Vertical Solid Line)RS485 Half- and Full-Duplex Control\nThe L TC2872 is equipped with a control to change the RS485 \ntransceiver operation from full-duplex to half-duplex.

In this ex-ample, a cable longer than 4000ft will attenuate the signal at the far end to less than what can be reliably detected by the receiver . \nFor data rates above 100kbps, the capacitive and inductive \nproperties of the cable begin to dominate this relation-ship. The attenuation of the cable is frequency and length dependent, resulting in increased rise and fall times at the far end of the cable. At high data rates or long cable lengths, these transition times become a significant part of the signal bit time. Jitter and intersymbol interference aggravate this so that the time window for capturing valid data at the receiver becomes impossibly small.\nThe boundary at 20Mbps in Figure 19 represents the \nguaranteed maximum operating rate of the L TC2872. The dashed vertical line at 10Mbps represents the specified maximum data rate in the RS485 standard. This boundary is not a limit, but reflects the maximum data rate that the specification was written for .  \nIt should be emphasized that the plot in Figure 19 shows \na typical relation between maximum data rate and cable length.  Results with the L TC2872 will vary, depending on cable properties such as conductor gauge, characteristic impedance, insulation material, and solid versus stranded conductors.\nLayout Considerations\nAll V\nCC pins must be connected together and all ground \npins must be connected together on the PC board with \nvery low impedance traces or dedicated planes. A 2.2µF , or larger , bypass capacitor should be placed less than 0.7cm away from V\nCC Pin 21. This V CC pin, as well as GND \nPin 18, mainly service the DC/DC converter .  Additional bypass capacitors of 0.1µF or larger , can be added to V\nCC Pins 1 and 31 if  the traces back to the 2.2µF capacitor are indirect or narrow. These V\nCC pins mainly service the \ntransceivers #1 and #2, respectively.  Table 11 summarizes the bypass capacitor requirements. The capacitors listed in the table should be placed closest to their respective supply and ground pin. \nTable 11. Bypass Capacitor Requirements\nCAPACITOR SUPPL Y (PIN) RETURN (PIN) COMMENT\n2.2µF V CC (21) GND (18) Required\n2.2 µF V DD (20) GND (18) Required\n2.2uF V EE (39) GND (18) Required\n0.1µF V L (35) GND (34) Required* \n0.1µF V CC (1) GND (5) Optional\n0.1µF V CC (31) GND (27) Optional\n* If V L is not connected to V CC.\nPlace the charge pump capacitor , C1, directly adjacent to the SW and CAP pins, with no more than one centimeter of total trace length to maintain low inductance. Close placement of the inductor , L1, is of secondary importance compared to the placement of C1 but should include no more than two centimeters of total trace length.\nThe PC board traces connected to high speed signals A/B \nand Y/Z should be symmetrical and as short as possible to minimize capacitive imbalance and to maintain good differential signal integrity. To minimize capacitive loading effects, the differential signals should be separated by more than the width of a trace and should not be routed on top of each other if they are on different signal planes.\nCare should be taken to route outputs away from any sen-\nsitive inputs to reduce feedback effects that might cause noise, jitter , or even oscillations. For example, DI and A/B should not be routed near the driver or receiver outputs.\nLTC2872\n22\n2872fTypical applica Tions\nFigure 20. L TC2872 in Various Basic Port Configurations\nFigure 21.
