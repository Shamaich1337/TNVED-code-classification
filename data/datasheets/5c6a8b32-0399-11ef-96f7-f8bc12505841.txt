The part can accept low level input \nsignals directly from a transducer and outputs a serial digital word. It employs a Σ -Δ conversio n technique to realize up to \n16 bits of no missing codes performance. The input signal is \napplied to a proprietary programmable gain front end based around an analog modulator. The modulator output is processed  \nby an on -chip digital filter. The first notch of this digital filter \ncan be programmed via the on -chip control register allowing \nadjustment of the filter cutoff and output update rate.  \nThe AD7715 features a differential analog input as well as a \ndifferential reference input. It op erates from a single supply ( 3 V  \nor 5 V). It can handle unipolar inp ut signal ranges of 0 mV to \n20 mV , 0 mV to 80 mV , 0 V to 1.25 V and 0 V to 2.5 V.  It  c a n  \nalso handle bipolar input signal ranges of ± 20 m V,  ±80 m V,  \n±1.25 V and ± 2.5 V . These bipolar ranges are referenced to the \nnegative input of the differential analog input. The AD7715 thus performs all signal conditioning and conversion for a single  channel system.  \nThe AD7715 is ideal for use in smart, microcontroller , or DSP -\nbased systems. It features a serial interface that can be configured  \nfor three -wire operation. Gain settings , signal polarity , and \nupdate rate selection can be configured in software using the input serial port. The part contains self -calibration and system \ncalibration options to eliminate gain and offset errors on the \npart itself or in the system.  \n \n  CMOS cons truction ensures very low power dissipation, and \npower -down mode reduces the standby power consumption to \n50 µW typ ical. The part is available in a 16 -lead, 0.3 inch -wide, \nplastic dual- in-line package ( PDIP) as well as a 16 -lead 0.3 inch  \nwide small outline  (SOIC _W) package and a 16 -lead TSSOP \npackage . \nPRODUCT  HIGHLIGHTS  \n1. The AD7715 consumes less than 450  µA in total suppl y \ncurrent at 3 V supplies and 1 MHz master clock, making it \nideal for use in l ow-power systems. Standby current is less \nthan 10  µA. \n2. The programmable gain input allows the AD7715 to accept \ninput signals directly from a strain gage or transducer removing a considerable amoun t of signal conditioning.  \n3. The AD7715 is ideal for microcontroller or DSP processor \napplications with a three -wire serial interface reducing the \nnumber of interconnect lines and reducing the number  \nof optocouplers required in isolated systems. The part \ncontains on -chip registers which allow software control \nover output update rate, input gain, signal polarity , and \ncalibration modes.  \n4. The part features excellent static performance specifications \nwith 16 -bits no missing codes, ± 0.0015% a ccuracy , and low \nrms noise (<550 nV). Endpoint errors and the effects of temperature drift are eliminated by on -chip calibration \noptions, which remove zero -scale and full -scale errors.  \nAD7715 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

When using a crystal or ceramic resonator across the  \nMCLK pins as the clock source for the device, the internal oscillator conti nues to run in standby mode and the power dissipation depends on the crystal or  resonator \ntype (see the Standby Mode section).  \nAD7715  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Pin Configuration  \nTable 6. Pin Function Descriptions  \nPin \nNo.  Mnemonic  Description   \n1  SCLK  Serial Clock. Logic input . An external serial clock is applied to this input to access serial data from the AD7715 . Thi s \nserial clock can be a continuous clock with all data transmitted in a continuous train of pulses. Alternatively, it can be a \nnoncontinuous clock with the information being transmitted to the AD7 715 in smaller batches of data.  \n2  MCLK IN  Master Clock Signal for the Device . This can be provided in the form of a crystal/resonator or external clock. A \ncrystal/resonator can be tied across the MCLK IN and MCLK OUT pins. Alternatively , the MCLK IN p in can be driven \nwith a CMOS -compatible clock and MCLK OUT left unconnected. The part is specified with clock input frequencies of \nboth 1 MHz and 2.4576 MHz.  \n3  MCLK OUT  When the master clock for the device is a crystal/resonator, the crystal/resonator is connected between MCLK IN and \nMCLK OUT. If an external clock is applied to MCLK IN, MCLK OUT provides an inverted clock signal. This clock can be \nused to provide a clock source for external circuitry.  \n4  CS Chip Select. Active low lo gic input used to select the AD7715. With this input hardwired low, the AD7715 can operate \nin its three -wire interface mode with SCLK, DIN, and DOUT used to interface to the device. CS can be used to select \nthe device in systems with more than one device on the serial bus or as a frame synchronization signal in \ncommunicating with the AD7715.  \n5  RESET  Logic Input. Active low input which resets the control logic, interface logic, calibration coefficients, digital filter , and \nanalog modulator of the part to power -on status.  \n6  AV DD  Analog Positive Supply Voltage , 3.3 V nominal ( AD7715-3 ) or 5 V nominal ( AD7715-5 ).  \n7  AIN(+)  Analog Input. Positive input of the programmable g ain differential analog input to the AD7715.  \n8  AIN( −)  Analog Input. Negative input of the programmable gain differential analog input to the AD7715.  \n9  REF IN(+)  Reference Input. Positive input of the differential reference input to the AD7715. The reference input is differential \nwith the provision that REF IN(+) must be greater than REF IN( –). REF IN(+) can lie anywhere between AV DD and AGND.  \n10  REF IN( −)  Reference Input. Negative input of the differential reference input to the AD7715. The REF IN( −) can lie anywhere \nbetween AV DD and AGND provided REF IN(+) is greater than REF IN( –).  \n11  AGND  Ground Reference Point f or Analog Circuitry . For correct operation of the AD7715, no voltage on any of the other pins \nshould go more than 30 mV negative with respect to AGND.  \n12  DRDY  Logic Output. A  logic low on this output indicates that a new output word is available from the AD7715 data register. \nThe DRDY  pin return s high upon completion of a read operation of a full ou tput word. If no data read has taken place \nbetween output updates, the DRDY  line return s high for 500 ×  tCLK IN  cycles prior to the next output update. While \nDRDY  is high, a read operation should not be attempted or in p rogress to avoid reading from the data register as it is \nbeing updated. The DRDY  line return s low again when the update has taken place. DRDY  is also used to indicate when \nthe AD7715 has completed its on -chip calibration sequence.  \n13  DOUT  Serial data output  with serial data being read from the output shift register on the part.

E | Page 11 of 40 TERMINOLOGY  \nIntegral Nonlinearity  \nThis is the maximum deviation of any code from a straight  \nline passing through the endpoints of the transfer function.  \nThe endpoints of the transfer function are zero -scale (not to  \nbe confused with  bipolar zero) , a point 0.5 LSB  below the first \ncode transition (000  …  000 to 000 … 001) and Full -Scale, a \npoint 0.5  LSB above the last code transition (111  … 110 to 111 \n… 111). The error is expressed as a percentage of full scale.  \nPositive Full -Scale Error  \nPositive Full -Scale Error is  the deviation of the last code \ntransition (111 . . . 110 to 111 . . . 111) from the ideal AIN(+) \nvoltage (AIN( −) + V REF/GAIN −3/2 LSBs). It applies to both \nunipolar and bipolar analog input ranges.  \nUnipolar Offset Error  \nUnipolar Offset Error is the deviation of the first code transition \nfrom the ideal AIN(+) voltage (AIN( −) + 0.5 LSB) when operating  \nin the unipola r mode.  \nBipolar Zero Error  \nThis is the deviation of the midscale transition (0111 . . . 111 to 1000 . . . 000) from the ideal AIN(+) voltage (AIN( −) − 0.5 LSB) \nwhen operating in the bipolar mode.  \nGain Error  \nThis is a measure of the span error of the ADC. I t includes full-\nscale errors but not zero -scale errors. For unipolar input ranges \nit is defined as (full scale error —unipolar offset error) while for \nbipolar input ranges it is defined as (full- scale error —bipolar \nzero error).  \nBipolar Negative Full -Scale Error  \nThis is the deviation of the first code transition from the ideal AIN(+) voltage (AIN(− ) − VREF/GAIN + 0.5 LSB), when \noperating in the bipolar mode.  Positive Full -Scale Overrange  \nPositive full -scale overrange is the amount of overhead available \nto handle input voltages on AIN(+) input greater than AIN −) + \nV\nREF/GAIN (for example, noise peaks  or excess voltages due  \nto system gain errors in system calibration routines) without introducing errors due to overloading the analog modulator  \nor overflowing the digital filter.  \nNegative Full -Scale Overrange  \nThis is the amount of overhead available to handle voltages  \non AIN(+) below AIN( −) −V\nREF/GAIN without overloading the \nanalog modulator or overflowing the digital filter. Note that the \nanalog input accept s negative voltage peaks even in the unipolar \nmode provided that AIN(+) is greater than AIN( −) and greater \nthan AGND −  30 m V. \nOffset Calibration Range  \nIn the system calibration modes, the AD7715 calibrates its \noffset with respect to the analog input. The offset calibration \nrange specification defines the range of voltages that  the AD7715 \ncan accept and still calibrate offset accurately.  \nFull -Scale Calibration Range  \nThis is the range of voltages that the AD7715  can accept in the \nsystem calibration mode and still calibrate full scale correctly.  \nInput Span  \nIn system calibration schemes, two voltages applied in sequence \nto the AD7715’s analog input defi ne the analog input range. The \ninput span specification defines the minimum and maximum \ninput voltages from zero to full scale that the AD7715  can accept  \nand still calibrate gain accurately.  \nAD7715  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 12 of 40 ON-CHIP  REGISTERS \nThe AD7715 contains four on -chip registers, which  can be \naccessed by via the serial port on the part. The first of these  \nis a communications register  that decides whether the nex t \noperation is a read or write operation and also decides which \nregister the read or write operation accesses. All communi -\ncations to the part must start with a write operation to the communications register . After power -on or RESET, the  \ndevice expects a write to its communications registe r. The data \nwritten to this register determines whether the next operation to the part is a write or a read operation and also determines to which register this read or write operation occurs. Therefore, write access to a ny of the other registers on the part starts with  \na write operation to the communications register  followed by a \nwrite to the selected register. A read operation from any register on the part (including the communications register itself and the output da ta register) starts with a write operation to the \ncommunications  register followed by a read operation from the \nselected register. The communication register also controls the \nstandby mode and the operating gain of the part. The \nDRDY  status \nis also available by reading from the communications  register. The \nsecond register is a setup register  that determines calibration \nmodes, filter selection and bipolar/unipolar operation. The \nthird register is the data register  from which the output data  \nfrom the part is accessed. The final register is a test register   \nthat is accessed when testing the device. It is advised that the user does not attempt to access or change the contents of the \ntest register as it may lead to unspecified operation of the \ndevice. The registers are discussed in more detail in the \nfollowing sections.  \nData Sheet  AD7715  \n \nRev. E | Page 13 of 40 COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER (RS1, RS0 = 0, 0)  \nThe communications register is an eight -bit register from which data can either be read or to which data can be written. All communica -\ntions to the part must start with a write operation to the communications register. The data written to the communications re gister \ndetermines whether the next operation is a read or write operation and to which register this operation takes place. Once th e subsequent \nread or write operation to the selected register is complete, the interface returns to where it expects a write operation to the communications  \nregister. This is the default state of the interface, and on power -up or after a reset, the AD7715 is in this default state waiting for a write \noperation to the communications register. In situations where the interface sequence is lost, if a write operation to the dev ice of sufficient \nduratio n (containing at least 32 serial clock cycles) takes place with DIN high, the AD7715 returns to this default state. Table 7 outlines \nthe bit designations for the communications register. \nTable 7. Communications Register  \n0/DRDY  ZERO  RS1  RS0  R/W STBY  G1 G0 \n \nTable 8. \nBit Name Description  \n0/DRDY  For a write operation, a 0 m ust be written to this bit so that the write operation to the communications register actually takes \nplace. If a 1 is written to this bit, the part will not clock on to subsequent bits in the register. Instead, it stays at this bit loca tion \nuntil a 0 is w ritten to this bit. Once a 0 is written to this bit, the next 7 bits are loaded to the communications register. For a read \noperation, this bit provides the status of the DRDY  flag from the part. The status of this bit is the same as the DRDY  output pin.  \nZERO  For a write operation, a 0 must be written to this bit for correct operation of the part. Failure to do this results in unspecified \noperation of the device. For a read operation, a 0 is read back from this bit locat ion.  \nRS1, RS0  Register Selection Bits. These bits select to which one of four on -chip registers the next read or write operation takes place as \nshown in Table 9 along with the register size. When the read or write to the select ed register is complete, the part returns to \nwhere it is waiting for a write operation to the Communications Register. It does not remain in a state where it continues to  \naccess the selected register.  \nR/W Read/Write Select. This bit sel ects whether the next operation  \nis a read or write operation to the selected register. A 0 indicates a write cycle as the next operation to the appropriate r egister, \nwhile a 1 indicates a read operation from the appropriate register.  \nSTBY  Standby. Writing a 1 to this bit puts the part in its standby or power -down mode. In this mode, the part consumes only  \n10 µA of power supply current. The part retains its calibration and control word information when in STANDBY. Writing a 0 to \nthis bit places the part in its normal operating mode. The default value for this bit after power- on or RESET is 0.  \nG1, G0  Gain Select bits. See Table 10. \n \nTable 9.

E | Page 14 of 40 SETUP REGISTER (RS1,  RS0 = 0, 1); POWER O N/RESET STATUS: 28  HEX \nThe setup register is an eight -bit register from which data can either be read or to which data can be written. This register controls the \nsetup that the device is to operate in such as the calibration mode, and output rate, unipolar/bipolar operation et c. Table 11 outlines the \nbit designations for the setup register. \nTable 11. Setup Register  \nMD1  MD0  CLK  FS1  FS0  B/U BUF  FSYNC  \nTable 12.  \nBit Name Description  \nMD1 , MD0  Mode select bits. These bits select the operating mode of the AD7715 (see  Table 13). \nCLK  The clock bit (CLK) should be set in accordance with the operating frequency of the AD7715 . If the device has a master clock \nfrequency of 2.4576 MHz, then this bit should be set to a 1. If the device has a master clock frequency of 1 MHz, then this b it \nshould be set t o a 0. This bit sets up the correct scaling currents for a given master clock and also chooses (along with FS1 and \nFS0) the output update rate for the device. If this bit is not set correctly for the master clock frequency of the device, th en the \ndevice ma y not operate to specification. The default value for this bit after power -on or reset is 1.  \nFS1, FS0  Along with the CLK bit, FS1 and FS0 determine the output update rat e, filter first notch and −3 dB frequency as outlined in  \nTable 14. The on -chip digital filter provides a sinc3 (or (Sinx/x)3) filter response. In association with the gain selection, it also \ndetermines the output noise (and theref ore, the resolution) of the device. Changing the filter notch frequency, as well as the \nselected gain, impacts resolution. Table  15 through Table 22 show the effect of the filter notch frequency and gain on the \noutput noise and effective resolution of the part. The output data rate (or effective conversion time) for the device is equa l  \nto the frequency selected for the first notch of the filter. For example, if the first notch of the filter is selected at  50 Hz then a \nnew word is available at a 50 Hz rate or every 20  ms. If the first notch is at 500 Hz, a new word is available every 2 ms. The \ndefault value for these bits is 1, 0.  \nThe settling -time of the filter to a full -scale step input change is worst c ase 4 × 1/(output data rate). For example, with the first \nfilter notch at 50 Hz, the settling time of the filter to a full -scale step input change is 80 ms maximum. If the first notch is at \n500 Hz, the settling time of the filter to a full -scale input step is 8 ms max. This settling -time can be reduced to 3 × 1/(output \ndata rate) by synchronizing the step input change to a reset of the digital filter. In other words, if the step input takes p lace \nwith the FSYNC bit high, the settling -time time is 3 × 1/(out put data rate) from when FSYNC returns low.  \nThe −3 dB frequency is determined by the programmed first notch frequency according to the relationship:  \nfilter −3 dB frequency  = 0.262 × filter first notch frequency  \nB/U A 0 in this bipolar/unipolar operation bit selects bipolar operation. This is the defau lt (power -on or reset) status of this bit . A 1 \nin this bit selects unipolar operation.  \nBUF  With this buffer control bit low, the on -chip buffer on the analog input is shorted out. With the buffer shorted out, the current \nflowing in the AV DD line is reduc ed to 250 µA (all gains at f CLK IN  = 1 MHz and gain of 1 or 2 at f CLK IN  = 2.4576 MHz) or 500 µA \n(gains of 32 and 128 @ f CLK IN  = 2.4576 MHz) and the output noise from the part is at its lowest. When this bit is high, the on -\nchip buffer is in series with t he analog input allowing the input to handle higher source impedances.  \nFSYNC  When this filter synchronization bit is high, the nodes of the digital filter, the filter control logic and the this bit goes  low, the \nmodulator and filter start to process data and a valid word is available in 3 × 1/(output update rate), that is, the settling -time of \nthe filter. This FSYNC bit does not affect the digital interface and does not reset the DRDY  output if it is low.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD7715  \n \nRev.

This is a one step calibration sequence and when complete the part returns to normal mode with MD1 and \nMD0 returning to 0, 0. The DRDY  output or DRDY bit goes high when calibration is initiated and returns low when this self -\ncalibration is complete and a new valid word is available in the data register.

Zero -scale system calibration is performed at the selected gain on the input voltage provided \nat the analog input during this calibration sequence.

An al terna -\ntive scheme for getting the part out of one of its test modes, is to \nreset the interface by writing 32 successive 1s to the part and then load all 0s to the test register. DATA REGISTER (RS1, RS0 = 1, 1)  \nThe data register on the part is a read -only 1 6-bit register  \nthat contains the most up -to-date conversion result from the \nAD7715. If the communications register data sets up the part for a write operation to this register, a write operation  must \nactually take place to return the part to where it is expecting  \na write operation to the communications register (the default state of the interface). However, the 16 bits of data written to  \nthe part will be ignored by the AD7715. \nAD7715  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

E | Page 18 of 40 CALIBRATION SEQUENCES  \nThe AD7715 contains a number of calibrat ion options as \noutlined in  Table 13. Table 23 summarizes the calibration types, \nthe operations involved and the duration of the operations. \nThere are two methods of determining the end of calibration. \nThe first is to monitor when DRDY  returns low at the end of \nthe sequence. DRDY  not only indicates when the sequence is \ncomplete but also that the part has a valid new sample in its \ndata register. This valid new sample is t he result of a normal \nconversion which follows the calibration sequence. The second method of determining when calibration is complete is to \nmonitor the MD1 and MD0 bits of the s etup register. When these bits return to 0, 0 following a calibration command, it \nindicates that the calibration sequence is complete. This method \ndoes not give any indication of there being a valid new result in the data register. However, it gives an earlier indication than \nDRDY  that calibration is complete. The duration to when the \nmode bits (MD1 and MD0) return to 0, 0 represents the \nduration of the calibration carried out. The sequence to when \nDRDY  goes low also includes a normal conversion and a \npipeline delay, t P, to correctly scale the resu lts of this first \nconversion. t P will never exceed 2000 × tCLK IN . The time for both \nmethods is given in  Table 23. \nTable 23.

E | Page 19 of 40 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD7715 is a Σ-Δ ADC with on-chip digital filtering, \nintended for the measurement of wide dynamic range, low \nfrequency signals such as those in industrial control or process control applications. It contains a Σ-Δ (or charge-balancing) \nADC, a calibration microcontroller with on-chip static RAM, a \nclock oscillator, a digital filter, and a bidirectional serial commu-nications port. The part consumes only 450 μA of power supply current, making it ideal for battery-powered or loop-powered instruments. The part comes in two versions, the AD7715-5  \nwhich is specified for operation from a nominal 5 V analog supply (AV\nDD) and the AD7715-3  which is specified for operation from \na nominal 3.3 V analog supply. Both versions can be operated \nwith a digital supply (DV DD) voltage of 3.3 V or 5 V . \nThe part contains a programmable-gain fully differential analog \ninput channel. The selectable gains on this input are 1, 2, 32, and 128 allowing the part to accept unipolar signals of between 0 mV to 20 mV and 0 V to 2.5 V or bipolar signals in the range \nfrom ±20 mV to ±2.5 V when the reference input voltage equals \n2.5 V . With a reference voltage of 1.25 V , the input ranges are from 0 mV to 10 mV to 0 V to +1.25 V in unipolar mode and from ±10 mV to ±1.25 V in bipolar mode. Note that the bipolar ranges are with respect to AIN(−) and not with respect to AGND. \nThe input signal to the analog input is continuously sampled at \na rate determined by the frequency of the master clock, MCLK \nIN, and the selected gain. A charge-balancing ADC (Σ-Δ mod-ulator) converts the sampled signal into a digital pulse train whose duty cycle contains the digital information. The programmable gain function on the analog input is also incorporated in this Σ-Δ \nmodulator with the input sampling frequency being modified  \nto give the higher gains. A sinc\n3 digital low-pass filter processes \nthe output of the Σ-Δ modulator and updates the output register at a rate determined by the first notch frequency of this filter. The output data can be read from the serial port randomly or \nperiodically at any rate up to the output register update rate. \nThe first notch of this digital filter (and therefore its –3 dB frequency) can be programmed via the setup register bits, FS0 and FS1. With a master clock frequency of 2.4576 MHz, the programmable range for this first notch frequency is from 50 Hz \nto 500 Hz giving a programmable range for the −3 dB frequency \nof 13.1 Hz to 131 Hz. With a master clock frequency of 1 MHz, the programmable range for this first notch frequency is from 20 Hz to 200 Hz giving a programmable range for the −3 dB \nfrequency of 5.24 Hz to 52.4 Hz. The basic connection diagram for the AD7715 -5 is shown in \nFigure 4. This shows both the AV\nDD and DV DD pins of the AD7715 \nbeing driven from the analog 5 V supply. Some applications \nhave AV DD and DV DD driven from separate supplies. An AD780, \nprecision 2.5 V reference, provides the reference source for the part. On the digital side, the part is configured for three-wire \noperation with CS\n tied to DGND. A quartz crystal or ceramic \nresonator provides the master clock source for the part. In most \ncases, it is necessary to connect capacitors on the crystal or resonator to ensure that it does not oscillate at overtones of its fundamental operating frequency. The values of capacitors vary depending on the manufacturer’s specifications. \nSCLK\nMCLK INDGNDDVDD\nMCLK OUTDINDOUT\nAGNDAIN(+)\nAIN(–)\nREF IN(+)\nREF IN(–)AVDD\nAD7715\nANALOG\nGROUND\nANALOG\nGROUNDDIFFERENTIAL\nANALOG INPUT\nVOUTVIN\nGNDAD780ANALOG\n5V SUPPLYDATA\nREADY\nRECEIVE\n(READ)\nSERIALDATA\nSERIALCLOCK\nCRYSTAL OR\nCERAMIC\nRESONATOR5V10µF 0.1µF\n10µF 0.1µF0.1µFANALOG\n5V SUPPLY\nRESETCSDRDY\n08519-004 \nFigure 4. AD7715 -5 Basic Connection Diagram \nANALOG INPUT \nAnalog Input Ranges \nThe AD7715 contains a differential analog input pair AIN(+) \nand AIN(−). This input pair provides a programmable-gain, \ndifferential input channel which can handle either unipolar or bipolar input signals. It should be noted that the bipolar input \nsignals are referenced to the respective AIN(−) input of the \ninput pair. \nIn unbuffered mode, the common-mode range of the input is \nfrom AGND to AV\nDD provided that the absolute value of the \nanalog input voltage lies between AGND − 30 mV and AV DD + \n30 mV . This means that in unbuffered mode the part can handle both unipolar and bipolar input ranges for all gains. In buffered \nmode, the analog inputs can handle much larger source imped-\nances but the absolute input voltage range is restricted to between AGND + 50 mV to AV\nDD − 1.5 V , which also places restrictions \non the common-mode range. This means that in buffered mode there are some restrictions on the allowable gains for bipolar \ninput ranges. Care must be taken in setting up the common-\nmode voltage and input voltage range so that the above limits  are not exceeded, otherwise there is a degradation in linearity \nperformance. \nAD7715  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 20 of 40 In unbuffered mode, the analog inputs look directly into the \ninput sa mpling capacitor, C SAMP. The dc input leakage current in \nthis unbuffered mode is 1  nA maximum. As a result, the analog \ninputs see a dynamic load that is switched at the input sample \nrate (see Figure 5). This sample rate depends on  master clock \nfrequency and selected gain. C SAMP is charged to AIN(+) and \ndischarged to AIN( −) every input sample cycle. The effective \non-resistance of the switch, R SW, is typically 7  kΩ. \nHIGH\nIMPEDANCE\n>1GΩRSW (7kΩ TYP)\nCSAMP\n(10pF)\nVBIAS\nSWITCHING FREQUENCY\nDEPENDS ON fCLKIN AND\nSELECTED GAINAIN(+)\nAIN(–)\n08519-005 \nFigure 5. Unbuffered Analog Input Structu re \nCSAMP must be charged through R SW and through any external \nsource impedances every input sample cycle. Therefore, in \nunbuffered mode, source impedances mean a longer charge \ntime for C SAMP, and this may result in gain errors on the part. \nTable 24 shows the allowable external resistance/capacitance \nvalues, for unbuffered mode, such that no gain error to the  \n16-bit level is introduced on the part.

C SAMP is charged via \nthis buffer amplifier such that source impedances do not affect the charging of C\nSAMP. This buffer amplifier has an offset leakage \ncurrent of 1 nA. In this buffered mode, larg e source impedances \nresult in a small dc offset voltage developed across the source impedance but not in a gain error.  Input Sample Rate  \nThe modulator sample frequency for the AD7715 remains at \nfCLK  IN/128 (19.2 kHz @ f CLK IN  = 2.4576 MHz) regardless of the \nselected gain. However, gains greater than 1 are achieved by a combination of multiple input samples per modulator cycle and \na scaling of the ratio of reference capacitor to input capacitor. A s \na result of the multiple sampling, the input sample rate of the device  \nvaries with the selected gain (see Table 25). In buffered mode, th e \ninput is buffered before the input sampling capacitor. In unbuffered  \nmode, where the ana log input looks directly into the sampling \ncapacitor, the effective input impedance is 1/C\nSAMP × fS where \nCSAMP is the input sampling capacitance and f S is the input \nsample rate.  \nTable 25.

Bipolar input ranges do not imply \nthat the part can handle negative voltages on its analog input since the analog input cannot go more negative than − 30 mV to \nensure correct operation of the part. The input channel is fully \ndifferential. As a result, the voltage to which the unipolar and \nbipolar signals on the AIN(+) input are referenced is the voltage on the respective AIN( −) input. For example, if AI N(−) is  \n2.5 V and the AD7715 is configured for unipolar operation with \na gain of 2 and a V\nREF of 2.5  V , the input voltag e range on the \nAIN(+) input is 2.5  V to 3.75 V.  I f  A I N ( −) is 2.5  V and the  \nAD7715 is configured for bipolar mode with a gain of 2 and a \nVREF of 2.5 V , the analog inpu t range on the AIN(+) input is \n1.25 V to 3.75 V (that is , 2.5 V ± 1.25 V). If AIN( −) is at AGND, \nthe pa rt cannot be configured for bipolar ranges in excess of \n±30 m V. \nBipolar or unipolar options are chosen by programming the  \nB/U bit of the setup register. This programs the channel for \neither unipolar or bipolar operation. Programming the channel \nfor either unipolar or bipolar operation does not change any  \nof the input signal conditioning; it simply changes the data output coding and the points on the transfer function where calibrations occur.  \nData Sheet  AD7715  \n \nRev. E | Page 21 of 40 REFERENCE  INPUT \nThe reference inputs  of the AD7715, REF  IN(+) and REF  IN(−), \nprovide a differential reference input capability. The common -\nmode  range for these differential inputs is from AGND to AV DD. \nThe nominal reference voltage, V REF (REF  IN(+) − REF  IN(−)), \nfor specified operation is 2.5  V for the AD7715- 5 and 1.25 V for \nthe AD7715- 3. The part is functional with V REF voltages down \nto 1 V but with degraded performance as the output noise will, \nin terms of LSB size, be larger. REF  IN(+) must always be \ngreater than REF  IN(−) for correct operation of the AD7715. \nBoth reference inputs provide a high impedance, dynamic load \nsimilar to the analog inputs in unbuffered mode. The maximum dc input leakage current is ± 1 nA over temperature and source \nresistance may result in gain errors on the part. In this case,  \nthe sampl ing switch resistance is 5  kΩ typical and the reference \ncapacitor  (C\nREF) varies with gain. The sample rate on the refer -\nence inputs is f CLK IN /64 and does not vary with gain. For gains  \nof 1 and 2, C REF is 8 pF; for a gain of 32, it is 4.25  pF, and for a \ngain of 128, it is 3.3125 pF. \nThe output noise performance outlined in Table  15 through \nTable 22 is for an analog input of 0  V which effectively removes \nthe effect of noise on the reference. To obtain the same noise \nperformance as sh own in the noise tables over the full input \nrange requires a low noise reference source for the AD7715. If \nthe reference noise in the bandwidth of interest is excessive, it will degrade the perfo rmance of the AD7715. In applications \nwhere the excitation voltage for the bridge transducer on the analog input also derives the reference voltage for the part,  \nthe effect of the noise in the e xcitation voltage will be removed  \nas the application  is ratiometric. Recommended reference \nvoltage sources for the AD7715- 5 include the AD780, REF43 \nand REF192, while the recommended reference sou rces for  \nthe AD7715- 3 include the AD589 and AD1580. It is generally \nrecommended to decouple the output of these references to further reduce the noise level.  DIGITAL  FILTERING  \nThe AD7715 contains an on -chip low -pass digital filter that \nprocesses the output of the part’s Σ -Δ modulator. Therefore, the \npart not only provides the analog -to-digital conversion function \nbut it also provides a level of filtering. Users should be aware that there are a number of system differences when the filtering function is provided in the dig ital domain  rather than the \nanalog domain . \nFirst, since digital filtering occurs after the A -to-D conversion \nprocess, it can remove noise injected during the conversion \nprocess. Analog filtering cannot do this. Also, the digital filter \ncan be made programmable far more readily than an analog filter. Depending on the digital filter design, this gives the user the capability of programming cutoff frequency and output update rate.  \nOn the other hand, analog filtering can remove noise super -\nimposed on the analog  signal before it reaches the ADC. Digital \nfiltering cannot do this and noise peaks riding on signals near \nfull scale have the potential to saturate the analog modulator \nand digital filter, even though the average value of the signal is within limits. To a lleviate this problem, the AD7715 has overrange  \nheadroom built into the Σ-Δ modulator and digital filter which \nallows overrange excursions of 5% above the analog input  range. If \nnoise signals are larger than this, consideration should be given to analog input filtering, or to reducing the input channel  voltage  \nso that its ful l scale is half that of the analog input channel  full \nscale. This provide s an overrange capability greater than 100%  \nat the expense of reducing the dynamic range by 1 bit (50%).  \nIn addition, the digital filter does not provide any rejection at integer mul tiples of the digital filter’s sample frequency. However , \nthe input sampling on the part provides attenuation at multiples of the digital filter’s sampling frequency so that the unattenu ated \nbands actually occur around multiples of the  sampling frequency \nf\nS (as defined in Table 25). Thus the unattenuated bands occur \nat n × fS (where n = 1, 2, 3 … ). At these frequencies, there are \nfrequency bands, ± f3 dB wide (f 3 dB is the cutoff frequency of the \ndigital filter) at either side wher e noise passes unattenuated to \nthe output.  \nAD7715  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 22 of 40 Filter Characteristics  \nThe AD7715’s digital filter is a low -pass filter with a (sinx/x)3 \nresponse (also called sinc3). The transfer function for this f ilter \nis described in the z- domain by  \n3\n1111)(\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\n−−×=−−\nzz\nNzHN\n \nand in the frequency domain by  \n3\n1)(\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb×π\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb×π×\n×=\nSS\nffSinffNSin\nNfH  \nwhere N is the ratio of the modulator rate to the output rate and \nfMOD is the modulator rate.  \nFigure 6 shows the filter frequency response for a cutoff frequency  \nof 15.72 Hz which corresponds to a first filter notch frequency \nof 60  Hz.

Frequency Response of AD7715  Filter  \nThe response of the filter is similar to that of an averaging filter \nbut with a sharper roll -off. The output rate for the digital filter \ncorresponds with the positioning of the first notch of the filter’s frequency response. Thus, for the plot of Figure 6 where the \noutput rate is 60  Hz, the first no tch of the filter is at 60  Hz. The \nnotches of this (sinx/x)\n3 filter are repeated at multiples of the \nfirst notch. The filter provides attenuation of better than 100  dB \nat these notches.  \nThe cutoff frequency of the digital filter is determined by the \nvalue loaded to the FS0 to FS1 bits in the setup register. program -\nming  a different cutoff frequency via FS0 and FS1 does not alter \nthe profile of the filter response; it changes the frequency of the \nnotches. The output update of the part and the frequency of th e \nfirst notch correspond.  \n Because the AD7715 contains this on -chip, low- pass filtering, \nthere is a settling time associated with step function  inputs and \ndata on the output is  invalid after a st ep change until the settling \ntime has elapsed. The settling time depends upon the output rate chosen for the filter. The settling time of the filter to a full -\nscale step input can be up 4 times the output data period. For a synchronized step input (using t he FSYNC function), the \nsettling time is 3 times the output data period.  \nPost -Filtering  \nThe on -chip modulator provides samples at a 19.2  kHz output \nrate wi th f CLK IN  at 2.4576 MHz. The on- chip digital filter decim ates \nthese samples to provide data at an ou tput rate that  corresponds \nto the programmed output rate of the filter. Because the output \ndata rate is higher than the Nyquist criterion, the output rate  for a given bandwidth satisfy s most application requirements. \nHowever, there may be some application s that require a higher \ndata rate for a given bandwidth and noise performance. Applications that need this higher data rate do  require some \npost -filtering following the digital filter of the AD7715 . \nFor example, if the required bandwidth is 7.86  Hz but the \nrequired update rate is 100  Hz, the data can be taken from the \nAD7715 at the 100  Hz rate giving a − 3 dB bandwidth of 26.2  Hz. \nPost-filtering can be applied to this to reduce the bandwidth \nand output noise, to the 7.86  Hz bandwidth level, while \nmaintaining an output rate of 100  Hz.  \nPost-filtering can also be used to reduce the output noise from \nthe dev ice for bandwidths below 13.1  Hz. At a gain of 128 and  \na bandwidth of 13.1  Hz, the output rms noise is 520  nV . This is \nessentially device noise or white noise and because  the input is \nchopped, the noise has a primarily flat frequency response. By reducing  the bandwidth below 13.1  Hz, the noise in the resultant  \npass-band can be reduced. A reduction in bandwidth by a factor \nof 2 results in a reduction of approximately 1.25 in the output rms noise. This additional filtering result s in a longer settling time.  \nData Sheet  AD7715  \n \nRev. E | Page 23 of 40 ANALOG  FILTERING  \nThe digital filter does not provide any rejection at integer mul -\ntiples of the modulator sample frequency, as outlined earlier. \nHowever, due to the high oversampling ratio  of AD7 715, these \nbands occupy only a small fraction of the spectrum and most \nbroadband noise is filtered. This means that the analog filtering requirements in front of the AD7715 are considerably redu ced \nvs. a conventional converter with no on -chip filtering. In addition, \nbecause the part’s common -mode rejection  performance of 95  dB \nextends out to several kilohertz, common -mode noise in this \nfrequency range is  substantially reduced . \nDepending on the ap plication, however, it may be necessary to \nprovide attenuation in front of  the AD7715 to eliminate \nunwanted frequencies from these bands which the digital filter will pass. It may also be necessa ry in some applications to \nprovide analog filtering in front of the AD7715 to ensure that \ndifferential noise signals outside the band of interest do not saturate the analog modulator.  \nIf passive components are placed in front of the AD7715, in unbuffered mode, take care to ensure that the source impedance \nis low enough so as not to introduce gain errors in the system. This significantly limits the amount of passive antialiasing filtering which can be provided in front of the AD7715 when it  \nis used in unbuffered mode. However, when the part is used  in buffered mode, large sourc e impedances simply result in a \nsmall dc offset error (a 10  kΩ source resistance cause s an offset \nerror of less than 10  µV). Therefore, if the system requires any \nsignificant source impedances to provide passive analog \nfiltering in front of the AD7715, it is recommended that the \npart be operated in buffered mode.  \nCALIBRATION  \nThe AD7715 provides a number of calibration options that  \ncan be programmed via the MD1 and MD0 bits of the s etup \nregister. The different calibration options are outlined in the \nsetup register and calibration sequences sections. A calibration  \ncycle may be initiated at any time by writing to the MD1 and \nMD0 bits of the setup register. Calibration on the AD7715 \nremoves offset and gain errors from the device. A calibration \nroutine should be initiated on the device whenever there is a change in the ambient  operating temperature or supply voltage. \nIt should also be initiate d if there is a change in the selected \ngain, filter notch or bipolar/ unipolar input range.  The AD7715 offers self -calibration and system -calibration \nfacilities. For full calibration to occur on the selected channel, the on -chip microcontroller must record the modulator output \nfor two different input co nditions. These are zero -scale  and \nfull-scale  points. These points are derived by performing a \nconversion on the different input voltages provided to the input of the modulator during calibration. As a result, the accuracy  \nof the calibration can only be as good as the noise level that it \nprovides in normal mode. The result of the zero -scale calibration  \nconversion is stored in the zero -scale calibrat ion r egister while \nthe result of the full- scale  calibration conversion is stored in the \nfull-scale calibration register.  With these readings , the on -chip \nmicrocontroller can calculate the offset and the gain slope for  \nthe input to output transfer function  of the converter . Internally, the \npart works with a resolution of 33 bits to determine  its conversion \nresult of 16 bits.  \nSelf- Calibration  \nA self -calibration is initiated on the AD7715 by writing  the \nappropriate values (0, 1) to the MD1 and MD0 bits of the s etup \nregister. In the self -calibration mode with a unipolar input \nrange, the zero -scale point used in determining the calibration \ncoefficients is with the inputs of the differential pair int ernally \nshorted on the part (that is , AIN(+) = AIN(− ) = internal bias \nvoltage ). The PGA is set for the selected gain (as per G1 and  \nG0 bits in the communications register) for this zero- scale \ncalibration conversion. The full- scale calibration conversion  \nis performed at the selected gain on an internally generated \nvoltage of V REF/selected gain.  \nThe duration time for the calibration is 6 × 1/output rate. This \nis made up of 3 × 1/output rate for the zero -scale calibration \nand 3 × 1/output rate for the full -scale calibration. At this time , \nthe MD1 and MD0 bits in the  setup register return to 0, 0.  \nThis gives the earliest indication that the calibration sequence  \nis complete. The DRDY  line goes high when calibration is \ninitiated and does not return low until there is a valid new word \nin the d ata register. The duration time from the calibration \ncommand being issued to DRDY  going low is 9 × 1/output rate. \nThis is made up of 3 × 1/output rate for the zero- scale calibration ,  \n3 × 1/output rate for the full -scale calibration, 3 × 1/output rate \nfor a conversion on the analog input and some overhead to set \nup the coefficients correctly. If DRDY  is low before (or goes low \nduring) the calibration command write to the setup register ,  \nit may take up to one modulator cy cle (MCLK  IN/128) before \nDRDY  goes high to indicate that calibration is in progress. \nTherefore, DRDY  should be ignored for up to one modulator \ncycle after the last bit is written to the s etup register in the \ncalibration command.  \nFor bipolar input ranges in the self -calibrating mode, the \nsequence is very similar to that just outlined. In this case, the \ntwo points are exactly the same as above, but because  the part  \nis configured for bipolar operation, the shorted inputs point is \nactually midscale of the transfer function.  \nAD7715  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 24 of 40 System Calibration  \nSystem calibration allows the AD7715 to compensate for system \ngain and offset errors as well as its own internal errors. System \ncalibration performs the same slope factor calculations as self calibration but uses voltage values presented by the system to \nthe AIN inputs for the zero - and full -scale points. full system \ncalibration requires a two step process, a zero -scale  system \ncalibration followed by a full -scale  system calibration.   \nFor a full system calibration, the zero -scale point must be \npresented to the converter first. It must be applied to the \nconverter before the calibration step is initiated and remain stable until the  step is complete. Once the system zero scale \nvoltage has been set up, a zero -scale system calibration is then \ninitiated by writing the appropriate values (1, 0) to the MD1 and MD0 bits of the s etup register. The zero -scale system \ncalibration is performed at the selected gain. The duration of the calibration is 3 × 1/output rate. At this time , the MD1 and \nMD0 bits in the  setup register return to 0, 0. This gives the \nearliest indication that the calibration sequence is complete. The \nDRDY  line goes high when calibration is initiated and does not \nreturn low until there is a valid new word in the data register. The duration time from the calibration command being issued \nto \nDRDY  going low is 4 × 1/output rate as the part perfor ms a \nnormal conversion on the AIN voltage before DRDY  goes low. \nIf DRDY  is low before (or goes low during) the calibration \ncommand write to the s etup register, it may take up to one \nmodulator cycle (MCLK  IN/128) before DRDY  goes high to \nindicate that calibration is in progress. Therefore, DRDY  should \nbe ignored for up to one modulator cycle after the last bit is \nwritten to the s etup register in the calibration command.  \nAfter the zero -scale point is calibrated, the full- scale point is \napplied to AIN and the second step of the calibration process is initiated by again writing the appropriate values (1, 1) to MD1 and MD0. Again , the full -scale voltage must be set up before the \ncalibration i s initiated and it must remain stable throughout the \ncalibration step. The full -scale system calibration is performed \nat the selected gain. The duration of the calibration is 3 × 1/output \nrate. At this time , the MD1 and MD0 bits in the s etup register \nretur n to 0, 0. This gives the earliest indication that the calibration  \nsequence is complete. The \nDRDY  line goes high when calibration  is \ninitiated and does not return low until there is a valid new word in the data register. The duration time  from the calibration \ncommand being issued to \nDRDY  going low is 4 × 1/output rate \nas the part performs a normal conversion on the AIN voltage \nbefore DRDY  goes low. If DRDY  is low before (or goes low \nduring) the calibration command, write to the s etup register, it \nmay take up to one modulator cycle (MCLK  IN/128) before \nDRDY  goes high to indicate that calibration is in progress. \nTherefore, DRDY  should be ignored for up t o one modulator \ncycle after the last bit is written to the s etup register in the \ncalibration command.  In the unipolar mode, the system calibration is performed \nbetween the two endpoints of the transfer function . In the \nbipolar mode, it is performed between  midscale (zero differential  \nvoltage) and positive full scale. \nThe fact that the system calibration is a two -step calibration \noffers another feature. After the sequence of a full system cali -\nbration has been completed, additional offset or gain cal ibration s \ncan be performed by themselves to adjust the system zero \nreference point or the system gain. Calibrating one of the parameters, either system offset or system gain, does  not  \naffect the other parameter.  \nSystem calibration can also be used to remove any e rrors from \nsource impedances on the analog input when the part is used in unbuffered mode. A simple R, C antialiasing filter on the front end may introduce a gain error on the analog input voltage but the system calibration can be used to remove this error . \nSpan and Offset Limits  \nWhenever a system calibration mode is used, there are limits  \non the amount of offset and span which can be accommodated. The overriding requirement in determining the amount of offset and gain that can be accommodated by the part is the requirement that the positive full -scale calibration limit is  \n≤ 1.05 × V\nREF/GAIN. This allows the input range to go 5%  \nabove the nominal range. The i n-built headroom in the  \nanalog modulator of the AD7715 ensures that the part still \noperate s correctly with a positive full -scale voltage which is  \n5% beyond the nominal.  \nThe range of input span in both the unipolar and bipolar modes has a minimum value of 0.8 × V\nREF/GAIN and a maximum valu e  \nof 2.1 × VREF/GAIN. However, the span (which is the difference \nbetween the bottom of the AD7715’s input range and the top  \nof its input range) must take into account the limitation on the positive full -scale voltage. The amount of offset that can be \naccommodated depends on whether the unipolar or bipolar mode is being used. Once again, the offset must take into account  \nthe limitation on the positive full -scale voltage. In unipolar \nmode, there is considerable flexibility in handling negative (with respect to AIN( −)) offsets. In both unipolar and bipolar \nmodes, the range of positive offsets which can be handled by the \npart depends on the selected span. Therefore, in determining  the \nlimits for system zero -scale and full -scale calibrations, the user \nhas to ensure tha t the offset range plus the span range does exceed  \n1.05 × V\nREF/GAIN. This is best illustrated by looking at the \nfollowing examples. \nData Sheet  AD7715  \n \nRev. E | Page 25 of 40 If the part is used in unipolar mode with a required span of  \n0.8 × VREF/GAIN, then the offset range which the system \ncalib ration can handle is from − 1.05 × VREF/GAIN to +0.25 × \nVREF/GAIN. If the part is used in unipolar mode with a required \nspan of V REF/GAIN, then the offset range which the system \ncalibration can handle is from − 1.05 × VREF/GAIN to +0.05 × \nVREF/GAIN. Similarly, if the part is used in unipolar mode and \nrequired to remove an offset of 0.2 × VREF/GAIN, then the span \nrange which the system calibration can handle is 0.85 × \nVREF/GAIN.  \nIf the part is used in bipolar mode with a required span of ±0.4 × \nVREF/GAIN, then the offset range which t he system calibration \ncan handle is from − 0.65 × VREF/GAIN to +0.65 × VREF/GAIN. If \nthe part is used in bipolar mode with a required span of ± VREF/ \nGAIN, then the offset range which the system calibration can handle is from − 0.05 × V\nREF/GAIN to +0.05 × VREF/GAIN. \nSimilarly, if the part is used in  bipolar mode and required to \nremove an offset of ± 0.2 × VREF/GAIN, then the span range \nwhich the system calibration can handle is ± 0.85 × VREF/GAIN.  Power -Up and Calibration  \nOn power -up, the AD77 15 performs an internal reset that sets \nthe contents of the internal registers to a known state. There are default values loaded to all registers after a power -on or reset. \nThe default values contain nominal calibration coefficients for \nthe calibration re gisters. However, to ensure correct calibration \nfor the device a calibration routine should be performed after \npower -up. \nThe power dissipation and temperature drift of the AD7715  \nare low, and no  warm -up time is required before the initial \ncalibration is performed. However, if an external reference is being used, this reference must have stabilized before calibration  is \ninitiated. Similarly, if the clock source for the part is generated from a cry stal or resonator across the MCLK pins, the start -up \ntime for the oscillator circuit should elapse before a calibration is initiated on the part (see the Clocking and Oscillator Circuit  \nsection).  \n \nAD7715  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 26 of 40 USING THE AD7715  \nCLOCKING AND OSCILLA TOR CIRCUIT  \nThe AD7715 requires a master clock input, which may be an \nexternal CMOS compatible clock signal applied to the MCLK  \nIN pin with the MCLK  OUT pin left unconnected. Alternatively ,  \na crystal or ceramic resonator of the correct frequency can be \nconnected between MCLK  IN and MCLK  OUT in which case \nthe clock circuit function s as an oscillator, providing the clock \nsource for  the part. The input sampling frequency, the modula -\ntor sampling frequency, the − 3 dB frequency, output update  \nrate and calibration time are all directly related to the master clock frequency, f\nCLK  IN. Reducing the master clock frequency by \na factor of 2 will halve the above frequencies and update rate, and double the calibration tim e. The current drawn from the \nDV\nDD power supply is also directly related to f CLK  IN. Reducing \nfCLK  IN by a factor of 2 will halve the DV DD current but does  not \naffect the current drawn from the AV DD power supply.  \nUsing the part with a crystal or ceramic re sonator between the \nMCLK IN and MCLK OUT pins generally causes more current to be drawn from DV\nDD than when the part is clocked from a \ndriven clock signal at the MCLK IN pin. This is because the on -\nchip oscillator circuit is active in the case of the cryst al or ceramic  \nresonator. Therefore, the lowest possible current on the AD7715  \nis achieved with an externally applied clock at the MCLK IN pin \nwith MCLK OUT unconnected and unloaded.  \nThe amount o f additional current taken by the oscillator depends  \non a number of factors —first, the larger the value of capacitor \nplaced on the MCLK  IN and MCLK  OUT pins, then the larger \nthe DV DD current consumption on the AD7715. Take care not \nto exceed the capacitor values recommended by the crystal and \nceramic resonator manufacturers to avoid consuming  unnecessary \nDV DD current. Typical values recommended by crystal or \nceramic resonator manufacturers are in the range of 30  pF to \n50 pF, and if the capacitor values on MCLK IN and MCLK OUT \nare kept in this range, they will not result in any excessive DV DD \ncurrent. Another factor that influences the DV DD current is the \neffective series resistance (ESR) of the cry stal which appears \nbetween the MCLK IN and MCLK OUT pins of the AD7715. As a general rule, the lower the ESR value then the lower the \ncurrent taken by the oscillator circuit.  \nWhen operating with a clock frequency of 2.4576 MHz, there  \nis 50  µA difference in the DV\nDD current between an externally \napplied clock and a crystal resonator when operating with a \nDV DD of 3 V.  Wi t h  D V DD = 5 V and f CLK IN  = 2.4576 MHz, the \ntypical DV DD current increases by 2 00 µA for a crystal/ resonat  \nor supplied clock v s. an externally applied clock. The ESR values \nfor crystals and resonators at this frequency tend to be low and \nas a result there tends to be little difference between different crystal and resonator types.  \n \n When operating with a clock frequency of 1  MHz, the ESR \nvalue for different crystal types varies significantly. As a result, \nthe DV\nDD current drain varies across crystal types. When using \na crystal with an ESR of 700  Ω or when using a ceramic r esonator, \nthe increase in the typical DV DD current over an externally -\napplied clock is 50  µA with DV DD = 3 V and 175 µA with DV DD \n= 5 V . When using a crystal with an ESR of 3  kΩ, the increase in \nthe typical DV DD current over an e xternally applied  clock is 100  µA \nwith DV DD = 3 V and 400  µA with DV DD = 5 V. \nThe on -chip oscillator circuit also has a start -up time associated \nwith it before it is oscillating at its correct frequency and correct voltage levels. The typical start -up time  for the circuit is 10  ms \nwith a  DV\nDD of 5 V and 15  ms with a DV DD of 3 V.  At  3  V suppli es, \ndepending on the loading capacitances on the MCLK pins, a \n1 MΩ feedback resistor may be required acr oss the crystal or \nresonator to keep the start up times around the 15  ms duration.  \nThe master clock of AD7715 appears on the MCLK OUT pin  \nof the device. Th e maximum recommended load on this pin is \none CMOS load. When using a crystal or ceramic resonator to \ngenerate the clock  of the AD7715, it may be desirable to then \nuse this clock as the clock sou rce for the system. In this case, it \nis recommended that the MCLK OUT signal is buffered with a CMOS buffer before being applied to the rest of the circuit.  \nSYSTEM SYNCHRONIZATI ON \nThe FSYNC bit of the s etup register allows the user to reset the \nmodulator a nd digital filter without affecting any of the setup \nconditions on the part. This allows the user to start gathering samples of the analog inp ut from a known point in time, that is , \nwhen the FSYNC is changed from 1 to 0.  \nWith a 1 in the FSYNC bit of the s etup register, the digital filter \nand analog modulator are held in a known reset state and the \npart is not processing any input samples. When a 0 is then \nwritten to the FSYNC bit, the modulator and filter are taken  \nout of this reset state and on the next master clock edge the  \npart starts to gather samples again.  \nThe FSYNC input can also be used as a software start convert \ncommand allowing the AD7715 to be operated in a conven -\ntional converter fa shion. In this mode, writing to the FSYNC bit \nstarts a conversion and the falling edge of DRDY  indicates when \nthe conversion is complete. The disadvantage of this scheme is \nthat the settling time of the filter has to be taken into account for every data register update. This means that the rate at which the data register is updated is three times slower in this mode.  \nData Sheet  AD7715  \n \nRev. E | Page 27 of 40 Because  the FSYNC bit resets the digital filter, the full settling \ntime of 3 × 1/output rate must elapse before there is a new word \nloaded to the output register on the part. If the DRDY  signal is \nlow when FSYNC goes to a 0, the DRDY  signal will not be reset \nhigh by the FSYNC command. This is because the AD7715 \nrecognizes that there is a word in the data register that has not \nbeen read. The DRDY  line stay s low until an update of the data  \nregister takes place at which time it go es high for 500 × tCLK IN  \nbefore retur ning low again. A read from the data register resets \nthe DRDY  signal high, and it does  not return low until the \nsettling time of the filter has elapsed (from the FSYNC command ) \nand there is a valid new word in the data register. If the DRDY  \nline is high when the FSYNC command is issued, the DRDY  \nline will not return low until the settling time of the filter has \nelapsed.  \nRESET INPUT \nThe RESET  input on the AD7715 resets all the logic, the digital \nfilter , and the analog modulator while all on -chip registers are \nreset to their default state. DRDY  is driven high and the AD7715 \nignores all communications to any of its registers while the \nRESET  input is low. When the RESET  input returns high, the \nAD7715 starts to  process data, and DRDY  return s low in 3 × \n1/output rate indicating a valid new word in the data register. \nHowever, the AD7715 operates with its default setup conditions \nafter a  reset  and it is generally necessary to set up all registers \nand carry out a calibration after a reset  command.  \nThe on -chip oscillator circuit of the AD7715 continues to func -\ntion even when the RESET  input is low. The master clock signal \ncontinues to be available on the MCLK OUT pin. Therefore, in applications where the system clock is provided by the clock  of the \nAD7715, the AD7715 produces an uninterrupted master clock \nduring \nRESET  commands.  \nSTANDBY MODE  \nThe STBY bit in the communications register of the AD7715 \nallows the user to place the part in a power -down mode when it \nis not required to provide conversion results. The AD7715 retains  \nthe contents of all its on -chip reg isters (including the data register ) \nwhile in standby mode. When released from standby mode, the \npart starts to process data and a new word is available in the \ndata register in 3 × 1/output rate from when a 0 is written to  \nthe STBY bit.  The STBY bit does  not affect the digital interface, and it does \nnot affect the status of the DRDY  line. If DRDY  is high when the \nSTBY bit is brought low, it will remain high until there is a valid \nnew word in the data register. If DRDY  is low when the STBY \nbit is brought low, it will remain low until the data register is \nupdated at which time the DRDY  line return s high for 500 × \ntCLK IN  before returning low again. If DRDY  is low when t he part \nenters its standby mode (indicating a valid unread word in the \ndata register), the data register can be read while the part is in \nstandby. At the end of this read operation, the DRDY  line will \nbe reset high as normal.  \nPlacing the  part in standby mode reduces the total current to  \n5 µA typical when the part is operated from an external master \nclock provided this master clock is stopped. If the external clock \ncontinues to run in standby mode, the standby current increases  to \n150 µA typical with 5 V supplies and 75 µ A typical with 3.3 V \nsupplies. If a crystal or ceramic resonator is used as the clock \nsource, then the total current in standby mode is 400  µA typical \nwith 5 V supplies and 90 µ A with 3.3 V supplies. This is because \nthe on -chip oscillator circuit continues to run when the part is \nin its standby mode. This is important in applications where the \nsystem clock is provided by the clock  of the AD7715, so that the \nAD7715 produces an uninterrupted master clock even when it \nis in its standby mode.  \nACCURACY  \nΣ-Δ ADCs, like VFCs and other integrating ADCs, do not \ncontain any source of nonmonotonicity and inherently offer  \nno missing codes performance. The AD7715 achieves excellent \nlinearity by the use  of high quality, on -chip capacitors, which \nhave a very low capacitance/voltage coefficient. The device also achieves low input drift through the use of chopper -stabilized \ntechniques in its input stage. To ensure excellent performance \nover time and tempera ture, the AD7715 uses digital calibration \ntechniques which minimize offset and gain error.  \nDRIFT CONSIDERATIONS  \nThe AD7715 uses choppe r stabilization techniques to minimize \ninput offset drift. Charge injection in the analog switches and dc \nleakage currents at the sampling node are the primary sources of offset voltage drift in the converter. The dc input leakage current is essentially in dependent of the selected gain. Gain  \ndrift within the converter depends primarily upon the temperature  \ntracking of the internal capacitors. It is not affected by leakage currents.  \nMeasurement errors due to offset drift or gain drift can be eliminated at a ny time by recalibrating the converter. Using  \nthe system calibration mode can also minimize offset and  gain errors in the signal conditioning circuitry. Integral and differential linearity errors are not significantly affected by temperature changes.  \nAD7715  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 28 of 40 POW ER SUPPLIES  \nThere is no specific power sequence required for the AD7715; \neither the AV DD or the DV DD supply can come up first. While \nthe latch -up performance of the AD7715 is good, it is important \nthat power is applied to the AD7715 before signals at REF  IN, \nAIN , or the logic input pins to avoid excessive currents. If this  \nis not possible, then the current that flows in any of these pins \nshould be limited. If separate supplies are used for the AD7715 \nand the system digital circuitry, then the AD7715 should be \npowered up first. If it is not possible to guarantee this, then current limiting resistors should be placed in series with the logic inputs to again limit the current.  \nDuring normal operation the AD7715 analog supply (AV\nDD) \nshould always be greater than or equal to its digital supply (DV DD). \nSupply Current  \nThe current consumption on the AD7715 is specified for supplies  \nin the range 3  V to 3.6 V and in the range 4.75  V to 5.25 V. The \npart operates over a 2.85 V to 5.25 V supply range and the I DD \nfor the part varies as the supply voltage varies over this range. \nFigure 7 shows the variation of the typical I DD with V DD voltage \nfor both a 1 MHz external clock and a 2.4576 MHz external \nclock at 25 °C. The AD7715 is operated in unbuffered mode. \nThe relationship shows that the I DD is minimized by operating \nthe part with lower V DD voltages. I DD on the AD7715 is also \nminimized by using an external master clock or by optimizing external components when us ing the on -chip oscillator circuit.  \nSUPPLY VOLTAGE, AV DD AND DVDD (V)0\n2.850.91.0\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n3.15 3.45 4.05 4.35 4.65 4.95 5.25 3.75MCLK IN = 2.4576MHz\nMCLK IN = 1MHzSUPPLY CURRENT, AV DD AND DVDD (mA)\n08519-007 \nFigure 7. IDD vs. Supply Voltage  \nGrounding and Layout  \nBecause  the analog inputs and reference input are differential, \nmost of the voltages in the analog modulator are common -\nmode voltages. The excellent common -mode rejection of  \nthe part remove s common -mode noise on these inputs. The \nanalog and digital supplies to the AD7715 are independent  \nand separately pinned out to minimize coupli ng between the \nanalog and digital sections of the device. The digital filter provide s rejection of broadband noise on the power supplies, \nexcept at integer multiples of the modulator sampling frequency. The digital filter also removes noise from the  analo g and reference inputs provided those noise sources do not saturate the analog modulator. As a result, the AD7715 is more \nimmune to noise interference than a conventional high \nresolution converte r. However, because the resolution of the \nAD7715 is so high and the noise levels from the AD7715 so low, \ncare must be taken with regar d to grounding and layout.  \nThe printed circuit board that  houses the AD7715 should be \ndesigned such that the analog and digital sections are separated and confined to certain areas of the board. This facilitates the \nuse of ground planes which can be separated easily. A minimum \netch technique is generally best for ground planes as it gives the best shielding. Digital and analog ground planes should only be joined in one place. If the AD7715 is the only device requiring \nan AGND to DGND connection, then the ground planes should be connected at the AGND and DGND pins of the \nAD7715. If the AD7715 is in a system where multiple devices \nrequire AGND to DGND connections, the connection should \nstill be made at one point only, a star ground point which should be established as clo se as possible to the AD7715. \nAvoid running digital lines under the device as these couple s \nnoise onto the die. The analog ground plane should be allowed \nto run under the AD7715 to avoid noise coupling. The power \nsupply lines to the AD7715 should use as large a trace as \npossible to provide low impedance paths and reduce the eff ects \nof glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals like \nclocks should be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating \nnoise to other sections of the board and clock signals should never be run near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of di gital \nand analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board should run at right angles to each other. This reduce s the effects of \nfeedthrough through the board. A microstrip technique is by far the best but is not always possible with a double -sided bo ard. In \nthis technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to \nground planes while signals are placed on the solder side.  \nGood decoupling is important when using high resolution ADCs. \nAll analog supplies should be decoupled with 10  µF tantalum in \nparallel with 0.1  µF capacitors to AGND. To achieve the best \nfrom these decoupling components, they must be placed as close   \nas possible to the device, ideally right up against the device. All \nlogic chips should be decoupled with 0.1  µF disc ceramic capaci tors \nto DGND. In systems where a common supply voltage is used to drive both the AV\nDD and DV DD of the AD7715, it is recommended  \nthat the AV DD supply of the system is used. This supply should \nhave  the recommended analog supply decoupling capacitors \nbetween the AV DD pin of the AD7715 and AGND and the \nrecommended digital supply decoupling capacitor between  \nthe DV DD pin of the AD7715 and DGND.  \nData Sheet  AD7715  \n \nRev. E | Page 29 of 40 Evaluating the AD7715  Performance  \nThe recommended layout for the AD77 15 is outlined in the \nevaluation board for the AD7715. The evaluation board \npackage includes a fully assembled and tested evaluation board, \ndocumentation, software for controlling the board over the USB \nport of a PC and so ftware for analyzing the performance of the \nAD7715 on the PC. The evaluation board model number is \nEVA L -AD7715 -3EBZ  . \nNoise levels in the signals applied to the AD7715 may also affect \nperformance of the part. The AD7715 software evaluation \npackage allows the user to evaluate the true performance of the \npart, independent of the analog input signal. The scheme \ninvolves using a test mode on the part where the differential \ninputs to the A D7715 are internally shorted together to provide \na zero differential voltage for the analog modulator. External to the device, connect the AIN( −) input to a voltage which is \nwithin the allowable common -mode range of the part. This \nscheme should be used after a calibration has been performed on the part.  DIGITAL  INTERFACE  \nThe programmable functions of the AD7715 are controlled \nusing a set of on -chip registers as outlined previously. Data is \nwritten to these registers via the serial interface of the part and read access to the on -chip registers is also provided by this \ninterface. All comm unications to the part must start with a \nwrite operation to the c ommunications register. After power -on \nor RESET, the device expects a write to its c ommunications \nregister. The data written to this register determines whether \nthe next operation to the part is a read or a write operation and \nalso determines to which register this read or write operation occurs. Therefore, write access to any of the other registers on the part starts with a write operation to the c ommunications \nregister followed by a write to  the selected register. A read \noperation from any other register on the part (including the output data register) starts with a write operation to the \ncommunications register followed by a read operation from the \nselected register.  \nThe serial interface of the AD7715 consists of five signals, \nCS, \nSCLK, DIN, DOUT , and DRDY . The DIN line is used for \ntransferring data into the on -chip registers while the DOUT \nline i s used for accessing data from the on -chip registers. SCLK \nis the serial clock input for the device and all data transfers \n(either on DIN or DOUT) take place with respect to this SCLK \nsignal. The DRDY  line is used as a status signal to in dicate when \ndata is r eady to be read from the data register  of the AD7715. \nDRDY  goes low when a new data word is available in the output \nregister. It is reset high when a read o peration from the data \nregister is complete. It also goes high prior to the updating of \nthe output register to indicate when not to read from the device to ensure that a data read is not attempted while the register is \nbeing updated. \nCS is used to select the device. It can be used to \ndecode the AD7715 in systems where a number of parts are \nconnected to the serial bus.  \nAD7715 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 30 of 40 Figure 8 and Figure 9 show timing diagrams for interfacing to \nthe AD7715 with CS used to decode the part. Figure 8 is for a \nread operation from the AD7715’s output shift register, while \nFigure 9 shows a write operation to the input shift register. It is \npossible to read the same data twice from the output register \neven though the DRDY  line returns high after the first read \noperation. Take care, however, to ensure that the read operations \nhave been completed before the next output update is about to take place. \nThe AD7715 serial interface can operate in three-wire mode by \ntying the CS\n input low. In this case, the SCLK, DIN and DOUT \nlines are used to communicate with the AD7715 and the status \nof DRDY  can be obtained by interrogating the MSB of the com-\nmunications register. This scheme is suitable for interfacing to \nmicrocontrollers. If CS is required as a decoding signal, it can \nbe generated from a port bit. For microcontroller interfaces, it is \nrecommended that the SCLK idles high between data transfers. \nThe AD7715 can also be operated with CS used as a frame \nsynchronization signal. This scheme is suitable for DSP \ninterfaces. In this case, the first bit (MSB) is effectively clocked \nout by CS because CS would normally occur after the falling \nedge of SCLK in DSPs. The SCLK can continue to run between \ndata transfers provided the timing numbers are obeyed. The serial interface can be reset by exercising the RESET  input \non the part. It can also be reset by writing a series of 1s on the \nDIN input. If a Logic 1 is written to the AD7715 DIN line for  \nat least 32 serial clock cycles, the serial interface is reset. This ensures that in three-wire systems that if the interface gets lost either via a software error or by some glitch in the system, it can \nbe reset back into a known state. This state returns the interface \nto where the AD7715 is expecting a write operation to its com-\nmunications register. This operation in itself does not reset the contents of any registers, but because the interface was lost, the information that was written to any of the registers is unknown and it is advisable to set up all registers again. \nSome microprocessor or microcontroller serial interfaces have  \na single serial data line. In this case, it is possible to connect  \nthe DOUT and DIN lines of the AD7715 together and connect \nthem to the single data line of the processor. A 10 kΩ pull-up resistor should be used on this single data line. In this case, if the interface gets lost, because the read and write operations \nshare the same line the procedure to reset it back to a known \nstate is somewhat different than described previously. It requires a read operation of 24 serial clocks followed by a write operation where a Logic 1 is written for at least 32 serial clock cycles to \nensure that the serial interface is back into a known state.\n \nDOUTSCLKCSDRDY\nMSBt5 t7t8\nt9\nLSBt6t3\nt4t10\n08519-008 \nFigure 8.

E | Page 31 of 40 CONFIGURING THE AD7715 \nThe AD7715 contains three on-chip registers which the user \naccesses via the serial interface. Communication with any of \nthese registers is initiated by writing to the communications register first. Figure 10 outlines a flow chart of the sequence \nwhich is used to configure all registers after a power-up or reset. \nThe flowchart also shows two different read options—the first \nwhere the DRDY\n pin is polled to determine when an update of the data register has taken place, the second where the DRDY  \nbit of the communications register is interrogated to see if a \ndata register update has taken place. Also included in the flowing diagram is a series of words which should be written  to the registers for a particular set of operating conditions. These conditions are gain of 1, no filter sync, bipolar mode, buffer off, clock of 2.4576 MHz, and an output rate of 60 Hz. \n \nSTART\nCONFIGURE AND INITIALIZE\nMICROCONTROLLER/MICROPROCESSOR SERIAL PORTPOWER-ON/RESET FOR AD7715\nWRITE TO COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER SETTING UP\nGAIN AND SETTING UP NEXT OPERATION TO BE A\nWRITE TO THE SETUP REGISTER (10 HEX)\nWRITE TO SETUP REGISTER SETTING UP REQUIRED\nVALUES AND INITIATING A SELF CALIBRATION (68 HEX)\nPOLL DRDY PIN\nDRDY\nLOW?\nYESNO\nWRITE TO COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER SETTING UP\nSAME GAIN AND SETTING UP NEXT OPERATION TO\nBE A READ FROM THE DATA REGISTER (38 HEX)\nREAD FROM DATA REGISTERPOLL DRDY BIT OF COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER\nYESNO\nWRITE TO COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER SETTING UP\nSAME GAIN AND SETTING UP NEXT OPERATION TO BE\nA READ FROM THE DATA REGISTER (38 HEX)WRITE TO COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER SETTING UP SAME\nGAIN AND SETTING UP NEXT OPERATION TO BE A READ FROM\nTHE COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER (08 HEX)\nREAD FROM COMMUNICATIONS REGISTER\nREAD FROM DATA REGISTERDRDY\nLOW?\n08519-010 \nFigure 10.

E | Page 32 of 40 MICROCONTROLLER /MICROPROCESSOR  INTERFACING \nThe flexible serial interface of the AD7715 allows for easy \ninterface to most microco ntroller s and microprocessors. T he \nflow  chart of Figure 10 outlines the sequence which should be \nfollowed when interfacing a microcontroller or microprocessor \nto the AD7715. Figure 11, Figure 12, and Figure 13 show some \ntypical interface circuits.   \nThe serial interface on the AD7715 has the capability of operating  \nfrom just three wires and is compatible with SPI interface \nprotocols. The three -wire operation makes the part ideal for \nisolated systems where minimizing the number of interface lines minimizes the number of opto -isolators required in the \nsystem. The rise a nd fall times of the digital inputs to the AD7715 \n(especially the SCLK input) should be no longer than 1  µs. \nMost of the registers on the AD7715 are 8 -bit registers. This \nfacilitates easy interfacing to the 8 -bit serial ports of micro -\ncontrollers. Some of the registers on the part are up to 16 bits, but data transfers to these 16 -bit registers can consist of a full \n16-bit transfer or two 8-bit transfers to the serial port of the \nmicrocontroller. DSP processors and microprocessors generally transfer 16 bits of data in a serial data operation. Some of these processors, such as the ADSP -2105, have the facility to program \nthe amount of cycles  in a serial transfer. This allows the user to \ntailor the number of bits in any transfer to match the register length of the required register in the AD7715. \nEven though some of the registers on the AD7715 are only  \neight bits in length, communicating with two of these registers \nin successive write operations can be handled as a single 16 -bit \ndata transfer if required. For example, if th e setup register is to \nbe updated, the processor must first write to the c ommunications  \nregister (saying that the next operation is a write to the s etup \nregister) and then write eight bits to the s etup register. This  \ncan all be done in a single 16 -bit tra nsfer if required because \nonce the eight serial clocks of the write operation to the communications register have been completed, the part \nimmediately sets itself up for a write operation to the s etup \nregister. AD7715 TO 68HC11 INTERFACE  \nFigure 11 shows an interface between the AD7715 and the \n68HC11 microcontroller. The diagram shows the minimum \n(three -wire) interface with CS on the AD7715 hardwired low. In \nthis scheme , the DRDY  bit of the c ommunications register is \nmonitored to determine when the d ata register is up dated. An \nalternative scheme, which increases the number of interface \nlines to four, is to monitor the DRDY  output line from the \nAD7715. The monitoring of the DRDY  line can be done in  \ntwo ways. First, DRDY  can be connected to one of the 68HC11’s \nport bits (such as PC0) which is configured as an input. This \nport bit is then polled to determine the status of DRDY . The \nsecond sc heme is to use an interrupt driven system, in which \ncase the DRDY  output is connected to the IRQ  input of the \n68HC11. For interfaces that require control of the CS input on \nthe AD7715, one of the port bits of the 68HC11 (such as PC1), \nwhich is configured as an output, can be used to drive the CS input.  \nAD7715\nDOUTSCLK\nCS68HC11SSDVDD DVDD\nRESET\nDINSCK\nMISO\nMOSI\n08519-011 \nFigure 11. AD7715 to 68HC11 Interface  \nThe 68HC11 is configured in the master mode with its CPOL \nbit set to a Logic 1  and its CPHA bit set to a Logic 1 . When the \n68HC11 is configured like this, its SCLK line idles high between data transfers. T he AD7715 is not capable of full duplex \noperation. If the AD7715 is configured for a write operation, no \ndata appears on the D OUT line s even when the SCLK input is \nactive. Similarly, if the AD7715 is configured for a read \noperation, data presented to the part on the D IN line is ignored \neven when SCLK is active.  \nCoding for an in terface between the 68HC11 and the AD7715 is \ngiven in the C Code for Interfacing AD7715 to 68HC11 section . \nIn this example, the \nDRDY  output line of the  AD7715 is con -\nnected to the PC0 port bit of the 68HC11 and is polled to \ndetermine its status.  \nData Sheet AD7715\n \nRev. E | Page 33 of 40 AD7715 TO 8XC51 INTERFACE \nAn interface circuit between the AD7715 and the 8XC51 \nmicrocontroller is shown in Figure 12. The diagram shows the \nminimum number of interface connections with CS on the \nAD7715 hardwired low. In the case of the 8XC51 interface, the \nminimum number of interconnects is just two. In this scheme, \nthe DRDY  bit of the communications register is monitored to \ndetermine when the data register is updated. The alternative \nscheme, which increases the number of interface lines to three, \nis to monitor the DRDY  output line from the AD7715 . The \nmonitoring of the DRDY  line can be done in two ways. First, \nDRDY  can be connected to one of the 8XC51’s port bits (such  \nas P1.0) which is configured as an input. This port bit is then \npolled to determine the status of DRDY . The second scheme  \nis to use an interrupt driven system in which case, the DRDY  \noutput is connected to the INT1  input of the 8XC51. For \ninterfaces that require control of the CS input on the AD7715, \none of the port bits of the 8XC51 (such as P1.1), which is configured as an output, can be used to drive the CS\n input. \nThe 8XC51 is configured in its Mode 0 serial interface mode. Its \nserial interface contains a single data line. As a result, the \nDOUT and DIN pins of the AD7715 should be connected \ntogether with a 10 kΩ pull-up resistor. The serial clock on the 8XC51 idles high between data transfers. The 8XC51 outputs the LSB first in a write operation while the AD7715 rearranged \nbefore being written to the output serial register. Similarly, the AD7715 outputs the MSB first during a read operation while the 8XC51 expects the LSB first. Therefore, the data which is read into the serial buffer needs to be rearranged before the correct data word from the AD7715 is available in the \naccumulator. \nAD7715\nDOUT8XC51\nDIN\nSCLKP3.0\nP3.110kΩRESETDVDD\nDVDD\nCS\n08519-012 \nFigure 12.

The RFS\n and TFS pins of the \nDSP processor are configured as active low outputs, and the \nDSP processor serial clock line, SCLK, is also configured as an \noutput.

Write to the s etup register, setting bipolar mode, buffer  \noff, no filter synchronization, confirming a clock frequency \nof 2.4576 MHz, setting the output rate f or 60  Hz and \ninitiating a self -calibration.  \n3.

E | Page 36 of 40 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe AD7715 provides a low cost, high resolution analog-to-\ndigital function. Because the analog-to-digital function is \nprovided by a Σ-Δ architecture, it makes the part more immune to noisy environments thus making the part ideal for use in \nindustrial and process control applications. It also provides a \nprogrammable gain amplifier, a digital filter and calibration options. Thus, it provides far more system level functionality than off-the-shelf integrating ADCs without the disadvantage  of having to supply a high quality integrating capacitor. In \naddition, using the AD7715 in a system allows the system \ndesigner to achieve a much higher level of resolution because \nnoise performance of the AD7715 is significantly better than \nthat of the integrating ADCs. \nThe on-chip PGA allows the AD7715 to handle an analog input \nvoltage range as low as 10 mV full-scale with V\nREF = 1.25 V . The \ndifferential inputs of the part allow this analog input range to \nhave an absolute value anywhere between AGND and AV DD \nwhen the part is operated in unbuffered mode. It allows the user to connect the transducer directly to the input of the AD7715. The programmable gain front end on the AD7715  allows the \npart to handle unipolar analog input ranges from 0 mV to  20 mV to 0 V to 2.5 V and bipolar inputs of ±20 mV to  \n±2.5 V . Because the part operates from a single supply, these \nbipolar ranges are with respect to a biased-up differential input. PRESSURE MEASUREMENT \nOne typical application of the AD7715 is pressure measurement. \nFigure 14 shows the AD7715 used with a pressure transducer, \nthe BP01 from Sensym. The pressure transducer is arranged in \na bridge network and gives a differential output voltage between \nits OUT(+) and OUT(−) terminals. With rated full-scale pressure \n(in this case 300 mmHg) on the transducer, the differential output voltage is 3 mV/V of the input voltage (that is, the \nvoltage between its IN(+) and IN(−) terminals).  \nAssuming a 5 V excitation voltage, the full-scale output range \nfrom the transducer is 15 mV . The excitation voltage for the bridge is also used to generate the reference voltage for the AD7715. Therefore, variations in the excitation voltage do not \nintroduce errors in the system. Choo sing resistor values of 24 kΩ \nand 15 kΩ as per the diagram give a 1.92 V reference voltage for \nthe AD7715 when the excitation voltage is 5 V .  \nUsing the part with a programmed gain of 128 results in the \nfull-scale input span of the AD7715 being 15 mV which \ncorresponds with the output span from the transducer. \nIN(–)OUT(+)IN(+)\nOUT(–)\nAUTO-ZEROED\nΣ-∆\nMODULATORCHARGE BALANCING ADC\nDIGITAL\nFILTERAVDD\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nREGISTER BANKMCLK IN\nMCLK OUT\nREF IN(+)\nREF IN(–)\nAGND\nDGND DOUT DIN CS SCLKDRDYRESET24kΩ\n15kΩDVDD\nAD7715+5V\nEXCITATION VOLTAGE = +5V\nAIN(+)\nAIN(–)\nA = 1 TO 128PGA BUFFER\nCLOCK\nGENERATION\n08519-014 \nFigure 14.

Figure 15 outlines a connection from a thermo-\ncouple to the AD7715. In this application, the AD7715 is operated \nin its buffered mode to allow large decoupling capacitors on the \nfront end to eliminate any noise pickup that there may have \nbeen in the thermocouple leads. When the AD7715 is operated \nin buffered mode, it has a reduced common-mode range. To place the differential voltage from the thermocouple on a suitable common-mode voltage, the AIN(−) input of the AD7715 is \nbiased up at the reference voltage, 2.5 V . \nFigure 16 shows another temperature measurement application \nfor the AD7715. In this case, the transducer is an resistive tem-\nperature device (RTD), a PT100. The arrangement is a 4-lead \nRTD configuration. There are voltage drops across the lead resistances R\nL1 and R L4, but these simply shift the common-\nmode voltage. There is no voltage drop across lead resistances R\nL2 and R L3 as the input current to the AD7715  is very low. The \nlead resistances present a small source impedance so it would \nnot generally be necessary to turn on the buffer on the AD7715 . \nIf the buffer is required, the common-mode voltage should be \nset accordingly by inserting a small resistance between the bottom end of the RTD and AGND of the AD7715. In the application \nshown in Figure 16, an external 400 μA current source provides \nthe excitation current for the PT100 and it also generates the \nreference voltage for the AD7715 via the 6.25 kΩ resistor. Varia-\ntions in the excitation current do not affect the circuit as both the input voltage and the reference voltage vary ratiometrically with the excitation current. However, the 6.25 kΩ resistor must have a low temperature coefficient to avoid errors in the reference voltage over temperature.\n \nSERIAL INTERFACEMCLK IN\nMCLK OUT\nREF IN(+)\nREF IN(–)\nAGND\nDGNDDOUT DIN SCLKAD7715\nAIN(+)\nAIN(–)\nA = 1 TO 128PGA BUFFER\nCLOCK\nGENERATION\nGNDVOUT REF192THERMOCOUPLE\nJUNCTION\n+5V\n+VINR\nR\nCCAUTO-ZEROED\nΣ-∆\nMODULATORCHARGE BALANCING ADC\nDIGITAL\nFILTERAVDD\nREGISTER BANK\nCSDRDYRESETDVDD5V\n08519-015 \nFigure 15.

Here, \nthe entire smart transmitter must operate from the 4 mA to  20 mA loop. Tolerances in the loop mean that the amount of \ncurrent available to power the transmitter is as low as 3.5 mA.
