### Component Summary: SXLP-135+

**Description:**
The SXLP-135+ is a low pass filter designed for RF applications, specifically operating within the frequency range of DC to 135 MHz. Its primary function is to allow signals below a certain cutoff frequency to pass while attenuating signals above that frequency, making it ideal for applications requiring harmonic rejection and signal integrity.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not specified in the provided data.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified in the provided data.
- **Power Consumption:** RF Power Input maximum of 0.5W.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -40°C to 85°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** Surface Mount, Case Style HF1139.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level:** Not specified, but the component is aqueous washable.
- **Special Features:**
  - High rejection with sharp cut-off characteristics.
  - Shielded package for reduced interference.
  - Low cost and RoHS compliant.

**Typical Performance Data at 25°C:**
- **Insertion Loss:** Varies from 0.02 dB at 1 MHz to 83.19 dB at 1200 MHz.
- **Return Loss:** Ranges from 0.00 dB at 1 MHz to 8.67 dB at 1200 MHz.
- **Group Delay:** Varies from 6.00 nSec at 1 MHz to 11.95 nSec at 150 MHz.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Defense Communications:** Used in military communication systems for filtering unwanted frequencies.
- **Receivers/Transmitters:** Essential in RF communication systems to ensure signal clarity and reduce noise.
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Effective in applications where it is critical to suppress harmonics to maintain signal integrity.

This component is particularly suited for applications in telecommunications, broadcasting, and any RF systems where signal fidelity is paramount.
