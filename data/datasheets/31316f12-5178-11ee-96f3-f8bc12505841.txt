It is \nintended to be used with a transceiver that has internal protection against other faults such as 24 V power supply miswiring. The \nModel CDSOT23-T24CAN-Q is designed with a minimum breakdown voltage of 26.2 V so that it will not conduct during a 24 VDC \npower cross event. \nThe surge test setup below shows the differential input/output (I/O) of a typical transceiver, its termination network, being protected \nby the CDSOT23-T24CAN-Q device. The 1.2/50 µs voltage, 8/20 μs current combination wave generator is connected to the circuit \nthrough two 80 ohm resistors and a coupling device (CD).  This circuit was subjected to a 500 V (1.2/50) longitudinal surge (common \nmode) in both positive and negative polarities per IEC 61000-4-5 (Level 1).  The oscilloscope traces in Figures 1 and 2 show the \nclamp voltage with respect to ground for the CAN H and CAN L signal lines, as well as the total surge current output from the surge \ngenerator into the circuit, for each of these surges. The peak current on each line is ~ 5.5 A (11 A total/2 lines) when subjected to the \n500 V (1.2/50) surge. The TVS diode clamps the voltage at the I/O of the transceiver within 37 V during the surge. \n \n \n  CANbus\nTransceiverCD\nCD\n-Q\nFigure 1 -  \nCDSOT23-T24CAN-Q Clamp Voltages for a +500 V SurgeFigure 2 -  \nCDSOT23-T24CAN-Q Clamp Voltages for a -500 V Surge\n CDSOT23-T24CAN-Q CANbus Protector\nLayout Considerations\nThe figure below shows an example of how the Model CDSOT23-T24CAN-Q can be connected on a two-sided PCB design. The \ndevice should be placed as close to the bus connector as possible with short traces to the signal lines. Since the connector pin \nspacing is generally much larger than the pin spacing of the transceiver, it is relatively easy to do this. A standard 10 mil, 1 ounce \ncopper trace is more than adequate to handle the peak current level from the 500 V surge discussed in the previous section. The \nground pin of the device should be connected to the circuit board ground plane using a short trace and a via. If there is a ground plane \non the signal side of the circuit board near where the diode array is placed, it should be connected directly to it.\n CDSOT23-T24CAN-Q\nTypical Part Marking\nXX  Y WW L2-DIGIT PRODUCT CODE:\n     C2 = CDSOT23-T24CAN-QMANUFACTURING DATE CODE:\n   • 1ST DIGIT INDICATES THE YEAR.\n   • 2ND & 3RD DIGITS INDICATE THE WEEK NUMBER.\n   • 4TH DIGIT INDICATES THE LOT CODE.   \n(UNDERSCORE DENOTES \nAEC-Q101 COMPLIANCY)How to Order\nCD  SOT23 - T  24  CAN - Q  \nCommon Code  \n Chip Diode\nPackage  \n SOT23 = SOT-23-3L Package\nModel  \n T = Transient Voltage Suppressor\nWorking Reverse Voltage  \n 24 = 24 V\nSuffix  \n CAN = CANbus Protector\nAEC-Q101 Suffix  \n Q = AEC-Q101 Compliant\nEnvironmental Specifications\nMoisture Sensitivity Level  ................................................................. 1\nESD Classification (HBM) ............................................................... 3B\nSpecifications\tare\tsubject\tto\tchange\twithout\tnotice.\nUsers\tshould\tverify\tactual\tdevice\tperformance\tin\ttheir\tspecific\tapplications.\t\nThe\tproducts\t described\t herein\t and\tthis\tdocument\t are\tsubject\t to\tspecific\t legal\t disclaimers\t as\tset\tforth\t on\tthe\tlast\tpage\t of\tthis\tdocument,\t and\tat\twww.bourns.com/docs/legal/disclaimer.pdf .\n CDSOT23-T24CAN-Q CANbus Protector\nSpecifications\tare\tsubject\tto\tchange\twithout\tnotice.\nUsers\tshould\tverify\tactual\tdevice\tperformance\tin\ttheir\tspecific\tapplications.\t\nThe\tproducts\t described\t herein\t and\tthis\tdocument\t are\tsubject\t to\tspecific\t legal\t disclaimers\t as\tset\tforth\t on\tthe\tlast\tpage\t of\tthis\tdocument,\t and\tat\twww.bourns.com/docs/legal/disclaimer.pdf .Product Dimensions Recommended Footprint\nSpecifications are subject to change without notice.\nCustomers should verify actual device performance in their specific applications.1 23B\nCD\nHL\n0 ° TO 8 ° IGAUGE\nPLANE\nKJSEATING PLANESEE \n   DETAIL\n         A\nDETAIL\nA\nGE\nFA\nMILLIMETERS\n(INCHES)DIMENSIONS =\nDimensions\nA2.74 - 3.00\n(0.108 - 0.118)\nB0.95    BSC(0.037) ...........\nC1.20 - 1.40\n(0.047 - 0.055)\nD2.10 - 2.49\n(0.083 - 0.098)\nE1.90    BSC(0.075) ...........\nF0.30 - 0.50\n(0.012 - 0.019)\nG0.89 - 1.17\n(0.035 - 0.046)\nH0.05 - 0.15\n(0.002 - 0.006)\nI0.25    BSC(0.010) ...........\nJ0.46 - 0.64\n(0.018 - 0.025)\nK0.40 - 0.58\n(0.016 - 0.023)\nL0.08 - 0.20\n(0.003 - 0.008)A B\nC\nE\nD\nMILLIMETERS\n(INCHES)DIMENSIONS\t=\nDimensions\nA0.95\n(0.037)\nB0.95\n(0.037)\nC2.00\n(0.079)\nD0.85\n(0.033)\nE0.85\n(0.033)\n CDSOT23-T24CAN-Q CANbus Protector\nPackaging Information\nThe product is dispensed in tape and reel format (see diagram below).\n.......\n.............. ....... .......\n....... ....... .......P AFE T\n120 \nD2\nD D1\nW1CIndex HoleP0\nP1\nW\nB\n10 pitches (min.)\nDirection of Feed10 pitches (min.)EndTrailer Device Leader\nStartd\nDIMENSIONS:MM\n(INCHES)\nDevices are packed in accordance with EIA standard  \nRS-481-A.\nItem Symbol SOT-23\nCarrier Width A2.25 ±0.10\n(0.088 - 0.004)\nCarrier Length B 2.34 ±0.10\n(0.092 - 0.004)\nCarrier Depth C 1.22 ±0.10\n(0.048 - 0.004)\nSprocket Hole d 1.55 ±0.05\n(0.061 - 0.002)\nReel Outside Diameter D 178\n (7.008)\nReel Inner Diameter D1  50.0       ... \n(1.969) Min.\nFeed Hole Diameter D2 13.0 ± 0.20\n (0.512 ± 0.008)\nSprocket Hole Position E 1.75 ± 0.10\n (0.069 ± 0.004)\nPunch Hole Position F 3.50 ± 0.05\n (0.138 ± 0.002)\nPunch Hole Pitch P 4.00 ±0.10\n(0.157 - 0.004)\nSprocket Hole Pitch P0 4.00 ± 0.10\n (0.157 ± 0.004)\nEmbossment Center P1 2.00 ± 0.05\n (0.079 ± 0.002)\nOverall Tape Thickness T0.20 ± 0.10 \n (0.008 ± 0.004)\nTape Width W 8.00 ±0.20\n(0.315 - 0.008)\nReel Width W1 14.4         . \n(0.567) Max.\nQuantity per Reel --  3,000Specifications\tare\tsubject\tto\tchange\twithout\tnotice.\nUsers\tshould\tverify\tactual\tdevice\tperformance\tin\ttheir\tspecific\tapplications.\t\nThe\tproducts\tdescribed\therein\tand\tthis\tdocument\tare\tsubject\tto\tspecific \t\t\nlegal\tdisclaimers\tas\tset\tforth\ton\tthe\tlast\tpage\tof\tthis\tdocument,\tand\tat \t\t\nwww.bourns.com/docs/legal/disclaimer.pdf .REV. 04/23Asia-Pacific: Tel: +886-2 2562-4117  \nEmail: asiacus@bourns.com\nEMEA: Tel: +36 88 885 877  \nEmail: eurocus@bourns.com\nThe Americas: Tel: +1-951 781-5500  \nEmail: americus@bourns.com\nwww.bourns.com\n Legal Disclaimer Notice\nThis legal disclaimer applies to purchasers and users of Bourns® products manufactured by or on behalf of Bourns, Inc. and its \naffiliates (collectively, “Bourns”).\nUnless otherwise expressly indicated in writing, Bourns® products and data sheets relating thereto are subject to change \nwithout notice.
