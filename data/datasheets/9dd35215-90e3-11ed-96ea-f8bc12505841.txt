The device is similar \nto the LTC5549, but with a broadband, differential DC to \n6GHz IF port. The LTC5548 is recommended for applica -\ntions  where t he IF frequency  range  extends  below  500MHz. \nFor applications where the IF frequency is always above \n500MHz, the LTC5549 is recommended, since it includes \nan integrated IF balun.\nThe LTC5548’s mixer and integrated RF balun are opti -\nmized to  cover the 2GHz to 14GHz RF frequency range. \nThe \ndevice includes an integrated LO amplifier optimized \nfor the 1GHz to 12GHz frequency range, requiring only \n0dBm drive. The device also includes an integrated LO \nfrequency doubler, which can be enabled or disabled with \na CMOS-compatible control pin.\nThe LTC5548 delivers exceptionally high IIP3 and P1dB, \nin addition to very low LO to RF and LO to IF leakages. \nThe part also offers high integration in a small package.\nConversion Loss and IIP3\n(Low Side LO, IF = 240MHz)applica Tions nUpconversion or Downconversion\n nHigh IIP3: +24.4dBm at 5.8GHz \n +21.4dBm at 9GHz\n n7.1dB Conversion Loss at 5.8GHz \n n+15.2dBm Input P1dB at 5.8GHz\n nIntegrated LO Buffer: 0dBm LO Drive\n nSelectable Integrated LO Frequency Doubler\n nLow LO-RF Leakage: <–30dBm\n n50Ω Wideband Matched RF and LO Ports\n n3.3V/120mA Supply\n nFast Turn ON/OFF for TDD Operation\n n3mm × 2mm, 12-Lead QFN Package\n nMicrowave T ransceivers\n nWireless Backhaul\n nPoint-to-Point Microwave\n nPhased-Array Antennas\n nC, X and Ku Band RADAR\n nTest Equipment\n nSatellite MODEMsL, LT , LT C , LT M , Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of Linear \nTechnology Corporation.

See the Block Diagram section for a \ndescription of each pin function. The RF and LO are single-\nended terminals. The IF is differential. An external balun is \nneeded if a single-ended IF signal is desired. The LTC5548 \ncan be used as a frequency downconverter where the RF \nis used as an input and IF is used as an output. It can also \nbe used as a frequency upconverter where the IF is used \nas an input and RF is used as an output. Low side or high \nside LO injection can be used. The evaluation circuit and the \nevaluation board layout are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2,  \nrespectively. \nFigure 2. Evaluation Board LayoutFigure 3.

The RF port is 50Ω matched from \n2GHz to 10GHz without C1. An LO between –6dBm and \n6dBm is required for good RF impedance matching.

The measured IF port return loss is shown in Figure 8.The differential IF output of the LTC5548 is suitable for \ndirectly driving a wideband differential amplifier or filter. \nFigure 9 shows a schematic for the evaluation of LTC5548 \nwith a differential IF at very low IF frequency. \nFigure 9.

An exter -\nnal 0°/180° power combiner is then used to convert the \n100Ω differential output to 50Ω single-ended to facilitate \nmeasurement. The measured performance is shown in \nFigure 10. The measured results do not include the loss \nof the L-pads and external 180° combiner.Enable Interface\nFigure 11 shows a simplified schematic of the EN pin \ninterface. To enable the chip, the EN voltage must be \nhigher than 1.2V. The voltage at the EN pin should never \nexceed V CC by more than 0.3V. If this should occur, the \nsupply current could be sourced through the ESD diode, \npotentially damaging the IC. If the EN pin is left floating, \nits voltage will be pulled low by the internal pull-down resistor and the chip will be disabled.\nX2 Interface\nFigure 12 shows a simplified schematic of the X2 pin \ninterface. To enable the integrated LO frequency doubler, \nthe X2 voltage must be higher than 1.2V. The X2 voltage \nat the pin should never exceed V\nCC by more than 0.3V. If \nthis should occur, the supply current could be sourced \nthrough the  ESD diode, potentially damaging the IC. If the \nX2 \npin is left floating, its voltage will be pulled low by the \ninternal pull-down resistor and the LO frequency doubler \nwill be disabled.\nSupply Voltage Ramping\nFast ramping of the supply voltage can cause a current \nglitch in the internal ESD protection circuits. Depending on \nthe supply inductance, this could result in a supply volt -\nage transient  that exceeds the maximum rating. A supply \nvoltage ramp time of greater than 1ms is recommended.Figure 10.
