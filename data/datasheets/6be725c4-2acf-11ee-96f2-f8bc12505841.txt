The device\ncan supply 1 A of output current with a dropout\nvoltage of 300 mV. Operating quiescent current is\n1 mA and drops to less than 1 µA in shutdown.\nCompared to many other regulators, quiescent current\nis well controlled and does not rise in dropout. In\naddition to fast transient response, a very low output\nnoise makes the TPS73801-SEP regulator ideal for\nsensitive RF supply applications.\nOutput voltage range is from 1.21 to 20 V and\nis stable with use of output capacitors as low\nas 10 µF. Small ceramic capacitors can be used\nwithout the necessary addition of ESR. Internal\nprotection circuitry includes reverse-battery protection,\ncurrent limiting, thermal limiting, and reverse-current\nprotection. The TPS73801-SEP regulator is available\nwith an adjustable 1.21-V reference voltage and in the\n6-pin TO-223 (DCQ) package.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER(1)GRADE PACKAGE\nTPS73801MDCQTPSEP20 krad(Si)\nRLATSOT-223 (6)\n6.55 mm × 7.26 mm\nMass = 119.8 mg(2) TPS73801MDCQPSEP\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the data sheet.\n(2) Mass is accurate to ±10%.TPS73801-SEP\nSLVSER5A – DECEMBER 2018 – REVISED MAY 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

DCQ Package\nSOT-223\nTop View\nTable 5-1. Pin Functions\nPIN\nI/O DESCRIPTION\nNO. NAME\n1 IN —Input. Power is supplied to the device through the IN pin. A bypass capacitor is required on this\npin if the device is more than six inches away from the main input filter capacitor. In general, the\noutput impedance of a battery rises with frequency, so it is advisable to include a bypass capacitor in\nbattery-powered circuits. A bypass capacitor (ceramic) in the range of 1 µF to 10 µF is sufficient. The\nTPS73801-SEP regulators are designed to withstand reverse voltages on the IN pin with respect to\nground and the OUT pin. In the case of a reverse input, which can happen if a battery is plugged in\nbackwards, the device acts as if there is a diode in series with its input. There is no reverse current\nflow into the regulator, and no reverse voltage appears at the load. The device protects both itself and\nthe load.\n2 OUT —Output. The output supplies power to the load. A minimum output capacitor (ceramic) of 10 µF\nis required to prevent oscillations. Larger output capacitors are required for applications with large\ntransient loads to limit peak voltage transients.\n3 GND — Ground.\n4 FB IFeedback. This is the input to the error amplifier. This pin is internally clamped to ±7 V. It has a bias\ncurrent of 3 µA that flows into the pin. The FB pin voltage is 1.21 V referenced to ground, and the\noutput voltage range is 1.21 V to 20 V.\n5 EN IEnable. The EN pin is used to put the TPS73801-SEP regulators into a low-power shutdown state.\nThe output is off when the EN pin is pulled low. The EN pin can be driven either by 5-V logic or\nopen-collector gate, normally several microamperes, and the EN pin current, typically 3 µA. If unused,\nthe EN pin must be connected to the IN pin. The device is in the low-power shutdown state if the EN\npin is not connected.\n6 GND — Ground.www.ti.comTPS73801-SEP\nSLVSER5A – DECEMBER 2018 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: TPS73801-SEP\n6 Specifications\n6.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nover operating free-air temperature range (unless otherwise noted)(1)\nMIN MAX UNIT\nVIN Input voltageIN –20 20\nVOUT –20 20\nInput-to-output differential(2)–20 20\nFB –7 7\nEN –20 20\ntshort Output short-circuit duration Indefinite\nTJ Operating virtual-junction temperature –55 150 °C\nTstg Storage temperature –65 150 °C\n(1) Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings  may cause permanent damage to the device.

The devices are capable of\nsupplying 1 A at a dropout voltage of 300 mV. The low operating quiescent current (1 mA) drops to less than\n1 µA in shutdown. In addition to the low quiescent current, the TPS73801-SEP regulators incorporate several\nprotection features which make them ideal for use in battery-powered systems. The devices are protected\nagainst both reverse input and reverse output voltages. In battery-backup applications where the output can be\nheld up by a backup battery when the input is pulled to ground, the TPS73801-SEP acts as if it has a diode\nin series with its output and prevents reverse current flow. Additionally, in dual-supply applications where the\nregulator load is returned to a negative supply, the output can be pulled below ground by as much as 20 V and\nstill allow the device to start and operate.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nIN\nENOUT\nFB\nGND+Reverse \nCurrent \nProtectionPass \nElementCurrent \nLimit\nError Amplifier\nVoltage Reference+Thermal \nOverload\nReverse \nVoltage \nProtection\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Adjustable Operation\nThe TPS73801-SEP has an adjustable output voltage range of 1.21 V to 20 V. The output voltage is set by the\nratio of two external resistors as shown in Figure 7-1 . The device maintains the voltage at the FB pin at 1.21 V\nreferenced to ground. The current in R1 is then equal to (1.21 V / R1), and the current in R2 is the current in R1\nplus the FB pin bias current. The FB pin bias current, 3 µA at 25°C, flows through R2 into the FB pin. The output\nvoltage can be calculated using the formula shown in Equation 1 . The value of R1 should be less than 4.17 k Ω\nto minimize errors in the output voltage caused by the FB pin bias current. Note that in shutdown the output is\nturned off, and the divider current is zero.\nTPS73801-SEPIN\nEN FBOUT\nGND\nR1R2+VINVOUT\nFigure 7-1.

By connecting the FB pin to OUT, the\nTPS73801-SEP will regulate the output to 1.21 V. During fixed voltage operation, the FB pin can be used for\na Kelvin connection if routed separately to the load. This allows the regulator to compensate for voltage drop\nacross parasitic resistances (R P) between the output and the load. This becomes more crucial with higher load\ncurrents.\nIN OUT\nFB\nGNDENTPS73801-SEP\nLoadVINRP\nRP+\n–\nFigure 7-2. Kelvin Sense Connection\n7.3.3 Overload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the TPS73801-SEP has safe operating area protection. The safe area protection\ndecreases the current limit as input-to-output voltage increases and keeps the power transistor inside a safe\noperating region for all values of input-to-output voltage. The protection is designed to provide some output\ncurrent at all values of input-to-output voltage up to the device breakdown.\nWhen power is first turned on, as the input voltage rises, the output follows the input, allowing the regulator\nto start up into very heavy loads. During start up, as the input voltage is rising, the input-to-output voltage\ndifferential is small, allowing the regulator to supply large output currents. With a high input voltage, a problem\ncan occur wherein removal of an output short does not allow the output voltage to recover. Other regulators also\nexhibit this phenomenon, so it is not unique to the TPS73801-SEP.\nThe problem occurs with a heavy output load when the input voltage is high and the output voltage is low.\nCommon situations occur immediately after the removal of a short circuit or when the shutdown pin is pulled\nhigh after the input voltage has already been turned on. The load line for such a load may intersect the output\ncurrent curve at two points. If this happens, there are two stable output operating points for the regulator. With\nthis double intersection, the input power supply may need to be cycled down to zero and brought up again to\nmake the output recover.\n7.3.4 Output Voltage Noise\nThe TPS73801-SEP regulators have been designed to provide low output voltage noise over the 10-Hz to\n100-kHz bandwidth while operating at full load. Output voltage noise is typically 40 nV/ √Hz over this frequency\nbandwidth for the TPS73801-SEP. For higher output voltages (generated by using a resistor divider), the output\nvoltage noise is gained up accordingly. This results in RMS noise over the 10-Hz to 100-kHz bandwidth of 14\nµVRMS for the TPS73801-SEP.TPS73801-SEP\nSLVSER5A – DECEMBER 2018 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS73801-SEP\nHigher values of output voltage noise may be measured when care is not exercised with regards to circuit layout\nand testing. Crosstalk from nearby traces can induce unwanted noise onto the output of the TPS73801-SEP.\nPower supply ripple rejection must also be considered; the TPS73801-SEP regulators do not have unlimited\npower-supply rejection and pass a small portion of the input noise through to the output.\n7.3.5 Protection Features\nThe TPS73801-SEP regulators incorporate several protection features that make them ideal for use in battery-\npowered circuits. In addition to the normal protection features associated with monolithic regulators, such as\ncurrent limiting and thermal limiting, the devices are protected against reverse input voltages, reverse output\nvoltages, and reverse voltages from output to input.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection are intended to protect the device against current\noverload conditions at the output of the device. For normal operation, the junction temperature should not\nexceed 125°C.\nThe input of the device withstands reverse voltages of 20 V. Current flow into the device is limited to less than 1\nmA (typically less than 100 µA), and no negative voltage appears at the output. The device protects both itself\nand the load. This provides protection against batteries that can be plugged in backward.\nThe output of the TPS73801-SEP can be pulled below ground without damaging the device. If the input is left\nopen circuit or grounded, the output can be pulled below ground by 20 V. The output acts like an open circuit;\nno current flows out of the pin. If the input is powered by a voltage source, the output sources the short-circuit\ncurrent of the device and protects itself by thermal limiting. In this case, grounding the EN pin turns off the device\nand stops the output from sourcing the short-circuit current.\nThe FB pin can be pulled above or below ground by as much as 7 V without damaging the device. If the input\nis left open circuit or grounded, the FB pin acts like an open circuit when pulled below ground and like a large\nresistor (typically 5 kΩ) in series with a diode when pulled above ground.\nIn situations where the FB pin is connected to a resistor divider that would pull the FB pin above its 7-V clamp\nvoltage if the output is pulled high, the FB pin input current must be limited to less than 5 mA. For example, a\nresistor divider is used to provide a regulated 1.5-V output from the 1.21-V reference when the output is forced to\n20 V. The top resistor of the resistor divider must be chosen to limit the current into the FB pin to less than 5 mA\nwhen the FB pin is at 7 V. The 13-V difference between OUT and FB pins divided by the 5-mA maximum current\ninto the FB pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 2.6 kΩ.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several different input and output conditions can occur. The output\nvoltage may be held up while the input is either pulled to ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage, or is left\nopen circuit. When the IN pin of the TPS73801-SEP is forced below the OUT pin or the OUT pin is pulled above\nthe IN pin, input current typically drops to less than 2 µA. This can happen if the input of the device is connected\nto a discharged (low voltage) battery and the output is held up by either a backup battery or a second regulator\ncircuit. The state of the EN pin has no effect on the reverse output current when the output is pulled above the\ninput.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\nSee the device modes in Table 7-1 .\nTable 7-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for\ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\n8.1.1 Output Capacitance and Transient Response\nThe TPS73801-SEP regulators are designed to be stable with a wide range of output capacitors. The ESR of\nthe output capacitor affects stability, most notably with small capacitors. A minimum output capacitor of 10 µF\nwith an ESR of 3 Ω or less is recommended to prevent oscillations. Larger values of output capacitance can\ndecrease the peak deviations and provide improved transient response for larger load current changes. Bypass\ncapacitors, used to decouple individual components powered by the TPS73801-SEP, increase the effective\noutput capacitor value.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic capacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured\nwith a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. The most\ncommon dielectrics used are Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics are good for providing\nhigh capacitances in a small package, but exhibit strong voltage and temperature coefficients. When used with\na 5-V regulator, a 10-µF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1 µF to 2 µF over the operating\ntemperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable characteristics and are more suitable\nfor use as the output capacitor. The X7R type has better stability across temperature, while the X5R is less\nexpensive and is available in higher values.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only sources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a\npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates voltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress,\nsimilar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or microphone works. For a ceramic capacitor, the stress can be\ninduced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients.\n8.2 Typical Application\nThis section will highlight some of the design considerations when implementing this device in various\napplications.\nTPS73801-SEPIN\nEN FBOUT\nGND\n    4 k\rR1         4.22 k\rR2 +VIN = 5 VC1 C22.5 V at 1 A\n10 µF 10 µF\nAll capacitors are ceramic.\nFigure 8-1.

Design Parameters\nDESIGN PARAMETER EXAMPLE VALUE\nInput voltage (V IN) 5 V\nOutput voltage (V OUT) 2.5 V\nOutput current (I OUT) 0 to 1 A\nLoad regulation 1%\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nThe TPS73801-SEP has an adjustable output voltage range of 1.21 to 20 V. The output voltage is set by the\nratio of two external resistors R1 and R2 as shown in Figure 8-1 . The device maintains the voltage at the FB\npin at 1.21 V referenced to ground. The current in R1 is then equal to (1.21 V / R1), and the current in R2 is the\ncurrent in R1 plus the FB pin bias current. The FB pin bias current, 3 µA at 25°C, flows through R2 into the FB\npin. The output voltage can be calculated using Equation 5 .\nOUT FBR2\nR1V 1.21 V(1 ) I R2 /c61 /c43 /c43 /c180\n(5)\nThe value of R1 should be less than 4.17 k Ω to minimize errors in the output voltage caused by the FB pin bias\ncurrent. Note that in shutdown the output is turned off, and the divider current is zero. For an output voltage of\n2.50 V, R1 will be set to 4.0 kΩ. R2 is then found to be 4.22 kΩ using the equation above.\nOUT4.22kV 1.21V(1 ) 3 A 4.22k4 0kµ./c87/c61 /c43 /c43 /c180 /c87/c87\n(6)\nVOUT = 2.50 V (7)\nThe adjustable device is tested and specified with the FB pin tied to the OUT pin for an output voltage of 1.21 V.\nSpecifications for output voltages greater than 1.21 V are proportional to the ratio of the desired output voltage to\n1.21 V: V OUT / 1.21 V. For example, load regulation for an output current change of 1 mA to 1.5 A is –2 mV (typ)\nat V OUT = 1.21 V. At V OUT = 2.50 V, the typical load regulation is:\n(2.50 V / 1.21 V)(–2 mV) = –4.13 mV (8)\nFigure 8-2  shows the actual change in output is approximately 3 mV for a 1-A load step. The maximum load\nregulation at 25°C is –8 mV. At V OUT = 2.50 V, the maximum load regulation is:\n(2.50 V / 1.21 V)(–8 mV) = –16.53 mV (9)\nSince 16.53 mV is 0.7% of the 2.5-V output voltage, the load regulation will meet the design requirements.www.ti.comTPS73801-SEP\nSLVSER5A – DECEMBER 2018 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS73801-SEP\n8.2.3 Application Curve\nFigure 8-2. 1-A Load Transient ResponseTPS73801-SEP\nSLVSER5A – DECEMBER 2018 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS73801-SEP\n9 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe device is designed to operate with an input voltage supply up to 20 V.

For best performance, all traces should be as short as possible.\n2. Use wide traces for IN, OUT, and GND to minimize the parasitic electrical effects.\n3. A minimum output capacitor of 10 µF with an ESR of 3 Ω or less is recommended to prevent oscillations.\nX5R and X7R dielectrics are preferred.\n4. Place the output capacitor as close as possible to the OUT pin of the device.\n5. The tab of the DCQ package should be connected to ground.\n10.2 Layout Example\nOUT FBR2\nR1V 1.21 V(1 ) I R2 /c61 /c43 /c43 /c180\nFigure 10-1. SOT-223 Layout Example (DCQ)\n10.3 Thermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device is limited by the recommended maximum operating junction\ntemperature (125°C). The power dissipated by the device is made up of two components:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage differential: I OUT (VIN – V OUT)\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage: I GND × V INTPS73801-SEP\nSLVSER5A – DECEMBER 2018 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS73801-SEP\nThe GND pin current can be found using the GND Pin Current graphs in Section 6.6  . Power dissipation is equal\nto the sum of the two components listed above.\nThe TPS73801-SEP series regulators have internal thermal limiting designed to protect the device during\noverload conditions. For continuous normal conditions, the recommended maximum operating junction\ntemperature is 125°C. It is important to give careful consideration to all sources of thermal resistance from\njunction to ambient. Additional heat sources mounted nearby must also be considered.\n10.3.1 Calculating Junction Temperature\nExample: Given an output voltage of 3.3 V, an input voltage range of 4 V to 6 V, an output current range of 0 mA\nto 500 mA, and a maximum ambient temperature of 50°C, what is the operating junction temperature?\nThe power dissipated by the device is equal to:\nIOUT(MAX) (VIN(MAX)  – V OUT) + I GND(VIN(MAX) ) (10)\nwhere\n• I OUT(MAX)  = 500 mA\n• V IN(MAX)  = 6 V\n• I GND at (I OUT = 500 mA, V IN = 6 V) = 10 mA\nSo,\nP = 500 mA × (6 V – 3.3 V) + 10 mA × 6 V = 1.41 W (11)\nThe thermal resistance of the DCQ package is 50.5°C/W. So the junction temperature rise above ambient is\napproximately equal to:\n1.41 W × 50.5°C/W = 71.2°C (12)\nThe junction temperature rise can then be added to the maximum ambient temperature to find the operating\njunction temperature (T J):\nTJ = 50°C + 71.2°C = 121.2°C (13)www.ti.comTPS73801-SEP\nSLVSER5A – DECEMBER 2018 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS73801-SEP\n11 Device and Documentation Support\n11.1 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com.
