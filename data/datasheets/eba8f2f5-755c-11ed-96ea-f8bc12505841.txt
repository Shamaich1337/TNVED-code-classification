Using EEPROM technology to maintain data in \nthe absence of power, the DS1682 requires no backup \npower source. The DS1682 detects and records the num -\nber of events on the EVENT pin and the total cumulative \nevent time since the DS1682 was last reset to 0. The \nALARM pin alerts the user when the total time accu -\nmulated equals the user-programmed alarm value. The \npolarity of the open-drain ALARM  pin can be programmed \nto either drive low or to become high impedance upon an \nalarm condition. The DS1682 is ideal for applications that \nmonitor the total amount of time that a device has been \nin operation and/or the number of uses since inception of \nservice, repair, or the last calibration.\nApplications\n ●High-Temp, Rugged, Industrial Applications Where  \nVibration or Shock Could Damage a Quartz Crystal\n ●Any System Where Time-of-Use is Important  \n(Warranty Tracking)Benefits and Features\n ●Records the Total Time That the Event Input Has \nBeen Active and the Number of Events That Have \nOccurred\n ●32-Bit, Nonvolatile, Elapsed Time Counter (ETC) \nMonitors Event Duration with Quarter-Second \nResolution and Provides 34 Years of Total Time \nAccumulation\n ●Programmable Elapsed Time ALARM  Output\n ●Nonvolatile, 17-Bit Event Counter Records the Total \nNumber of Times an Event has Occurred\n ●Calibrated, Temperature-Compensated RC Time \nBase Accurate to 2% Typical\n ●10 Bytes of EEPROM User Memory\n ●Write Disable Function to Prevent the Memory from \nBeing Changed or Erased\n ●2-Wire Serial Communication\n ●Wide 2.5V to 5.5V Power-Supply Range\n ●Useful in Time-of-Use Warranty, Calibration, Repair, \nand Maintenance Applications\nOrdering Information  appears at end of data sheet.\nFigure 1.

The configuration register, alarm trip-point register, and user memory use a single array, limiting them to one E E.\nNote 3:  A decoupling capacitor to supply high instantaneous currents during EEPROM writes is recommended. A typical value is \n0.01μF. V CC must be maintained above V CC minimum, including transients, during EEPROM writes.\nNote 4:  VCC must be at or above 2.5V for t EW after the end of an event to ensure data transfer to the EEPROM.\nNote 5:  Reading data while the contents of EEPROM are transferred to RAM results in incorrect reads.\nNote 6:  After this period, the first clock pulse is generated.\nNote 7:  A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referred to the V IH(MIN)  of the SCL signal) \nto bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.\nNote 8:  The maximum t HD:DAT  has only to be met if the device does not stretch the low period (t LOW) of the SCL signal. \nNote 9:  A fast-mode device can be used in a standard-mode system, but the requirement t SU:DAT  ≥ 250ns must be met.

The EVENT pin is the input the DS1682 monitors to determine when an event occurs. When \nthe pin is pulled high, the contents of the EEPROM are transferred to the ETC and the oscillator starts. \nThe ETC begins to count in quarter-second increments. When the EVENT pin falls to logic 0, the event \ncounter increments, and the event counter, ETC, and user-memory data are stored in the EEPROM array. \nWhen the EVENT pin changes states, the 2-wire bus is unavailable for communications for t EW (falling) \nand t ER (rising). The EVENT input is also deglitched (t G) to prevent short noise spikes from triggering an \nevent.\n2, 7 N.C. No Connection. These pins are not connected internally.\n3 ALARMActive-Low Alarm Output. The DS1682 monitors the values in the ETC for the programmed value in \nthe alarm register. When the ETC matches the alarm value, the alarm flag (AF) is set. Once set, the \nalarm flag cannot be reset. See the operating descriptions for the AOS and AP bits for details about the \noperation of the ALARM  pin.\n4 GND Ground\n5 SCL2-Wire Serial-Clock Input.

Upon \npower-up, the DS1682 transfers the contents of the \nEEPROM into the counters and memory registers where \nthe data can be read and written through the serial inter -\nface. The content of the counters and memory registers \nare written into the EEPROM memory when the EVENT \npin transitions from a logic-high to a logic-low.\nThe DS1682 uses a calibrated, temperature-compensat -\ned RC time base to increment an ETC while an event \nis active. When the event becomes active, the contents \nof the nonvolatile EEPROM are transferred to the ETC \nand event counter and the oscillator starts. As the event \ncontinues, the ETC is incremented in quarter-second \nincrements. When the event becomes inactive, the event \ncounter is incremented and the contents of the ETC and \nevent counter are written to the nonvolatile EEPROM.\nThe ALARM  output can be used to indicate when the ETC \nhas matched the value in the alarm register.\nThe DS1682 can be configured to prevent clearing the \nalarm and the elapsed time and event counters.The user \nmemory can be separately write protected.\nUser-modified data is not stored in EEPROM until an \nevent becomes inactive.\nFigure 2  shows the DS1682 measuring total run time and \noperating from a battery with the alarm tied to an LED and \na pushbutton switch to trigger the alarm output.Figure 3  shows the DS1682 in a total time-of-use applica -\ntion where power may be removed at the same time as \nthe end of the event. The V CC slew rate at power-down is \nfast with respect to t EW. A capacitor maintains V CC on the \nDS1682 above 2.5V until the EEPROM write completes. A \nSchottky diode blocks current from the capacitor to other \ndevices connected to V CC.\nThe V CC holding capacitor value of 30μF is calcu lated \nusing the maximum EEPROM write current and EEPROM \nwrite time. This assumes that the V CC slew rate allows \ntime from EVENT trip point to V CC at 2.5V on the DS1682 \nis at least t EW.\nFigure 4  shows the DS1682 in a total time-of-use applica -\ntion with power that can be removed at the sametime as \nthe end of the event. In this application, the V CC slew rate \nat power-down is slow with respect to t EW. The external \nreset IC (DS1816) ends the event as V CC begins to drop. \nVCC must remain above 2.5V until the end of t EW.Figure 3.

When an event triggers the input by transitioning \nthe EVENT pin from a low to a high level, the following \noccurs:\n1) The RC oscillator starts.\n2) The alarm, ETC, and event counter are transferred \nfrom EEPROM to RAM.\n3) Note: Reading the RAM during the transfer results in \ninvalid data.\n4) After t ES, the ETC increments. An event greater than \ntG but less than t ES increments the event counter, but \nnot the ETC (zero-length event).\n5) The ETC increments every t EI. The ETC holds time in \nquarter-second resolution.\n6) When the EVENT pin goes low, the event counter \nincrements, the oscillator stops, and the ETC and \nevent counter are transferred to EEPROM. The 2-wire \nbus is not available for t EW.\nThe ETC stops counting and does not roll over once \nFFFFFFFFh, or approximately 34 years, is reached. See \nFigure 5  for timing.Device Setup\nOnce installed in a system, the DS1682 can be pro -\ngrammed to record events as required by the application, \nand can be tested by generating events and monitoring \nthe results. Afterwards, it can be “locked” to prevent \nalteration of the event and alarm registers and the alarm \ncondition.\nThe following is a typical sequence:\n1) Write the configuration register, alarm registers, and \nuser memory to the desired values.\n2) Write-protect the alarm, ETC, and event counter regis -\nters with the write disable command if needed.\n3) Write-protect the user memory with the write-memory-\ndisable command, if needed.\n4) Issue a reset (described in the Reset Command  section).\nThe alarm, ETC and event counter registers, and user \nmemory, once locked, cannot be changed.\nUpon reset, the ETC and event counter registers are \ncleared. The device clears the RE bit, and the configu -\nration register becomes read-only. Additional resets are \nignored.\nFigure 5. Event Input TimingINTERNAL EVENT\nCLOCKtG\ntEStEIEVENT INPUT\nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder\nwith Alarm\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 8\nAlarm\nThe alarm register is a 32-bit register that holds time in \nquarter-second resolution. When a nonzero number is \nprogrammed into the alarm register, the ALARM  func -\ntion is enabled and the DS1682 monitors the values in \nthe ETC for the programmed value in the alarm register. \nWhen the ETC matches the alarm value, the alarm flag \nis set.\nEEPROM Array\nWhen power is applied, the contents of the EEPROM are \ntransferred to the configuration register, alarm register, \nETC, event counter, and user memory. When the event \npin goes low, V CC must remain above V CC minimum for \ntEW to ensure the EEPROM is properly written.\nThe EEPROM array for the ETC and the event counter is \nmade up of three banks. Each bank can be written a maxi -\nmum of 50k times. The device switches between banks \nbased upon the value in the event counter. Resetting the \nevent counter before the counter reaches 50,000 causes \nadditional writes to the first bank, which can allow writes \nin excess of 50k. If the event counter is set to greater \nthan 50k or 100k prior to reset, the device stays on the \nselected bank. This could result in writes in excess of 50k \nto one bank.\nThe configuration and alarm registers and the user mem -\nory are held in one bank of EEPROM. Writes at the end \nof an event only occur if the data has changed in one or \nmore of those registers.User-modified data in any of the registers is stored in \nEEPROM only if the data was written while an event was \nactive and is stored when the event ends.\nEvent Counter Register\nThis 17-bit event counter register set provides the total \nnumber of data samples logged during the life of the prod -\nuct up to 131,072 separate events. The event counter \nconsists of 2 bytes of memory in the memory map plus \nthe event counter MSB bit (ECMSB) in the configuration \nregister. Once the event counter reaches 1FFFFh, event \ncounting stops.\nReset Command\nIf RE is set to a 1, a reset occurs when a reset command \nis sent through the 2-wire bus. A reset command is issued \nby writing 55h twice into memory location 1Dh. The writes \nneed not be consecutive. Cycling power on V CC prior to \nthe second write terminates the reset sequence.\nUpon reset, the ETC and event counter registers are \ncleared. The AF, RE, and ECMSB bits are cleared by the \ndevice, and the configuration register becomes read-only. \nThe data are written to the EEPROM, and additional \nresets are ignored.\nWhen a reset command is issued, no additional command \nshould be issued during the EEPROM write time (t EW).\nDS1682 Total-Elapsed-Time Recorder\nwith Alarm\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 9\nBit 6: Alarm Flag (AF).  The alarm flag is set to a 1 when \nthe ETC value matches the alarm register. Once the AF \nbit is set to a 1, it cannot be set to a 0. This bit is read-only.\nBit 5: Write Disable Flag (WDF).  When the write disable \ncommand is written to AAh twice at memory location 1Eh, \nthe WDF is set to a 1 and cannot be cleared or reset. \nWhen WDF is set to a 1, the alarm, ETC, and event coun -\nter registers are read-only. This bit is read-only. The writes \nneed not be consecutive. Cycling power on V CC prior to \nthe second write terminates the reset sequence.\nBit 4: Write-Memory-Disable Flag (WMDF).  When the \nwrite-memory-disable command is written to F0h twice \nat memory location 1Fh, the WMDF is set to a 1 and \ncannot be reset or cleared. Once the WMDF is set to a \n1, the 10-byte user memory becomes read-only. This bit \nis read-only. The writes need not be consecutive. Cycling \npower on V CC prior to the second write terminates the \nreset sequence.\nBit 3: Alarm Output Select (AOS).  If AOS is 0 and AF is \ntrue, the DS1682 activates the ALARM  output during an \nevent when AF becomes true. The DS1682 also activates \nthe ALARM  output by pulling the pin low four times at \npower-up, at the start and end of an event, or when the \nALARM  pin is pulled low and released. This output mode \ncan be used to flash an LED or to communicate with another device to indicate that an alarm has occurred. AP \nhas no affect on the output when AOS is 0. \nIf AOS is a 1 and AF is true, the ALARM  output is constant \nwhen the alarm is active. AP determines the polarity of \nthe output.\nBit 2: Reset Enable (RE).  The reset enable bit allows the \ndevice to be reset by enabling the reset command. The \nsections of the DS1682 that are reset are then dependent \non the value in the WDF. With the WDF set to 0 and the \nreset enable bit set to a 1, the reset command clears \nthe ETC, EEPROM, and event counter. When the reset \nenable bit is set to a 0, the reset command is disabled.\nBit 1: Alarm Polarity (AP).  When the alarm polarity bit \nin the configuration register is set to 0, the ALARM output \nis high impedance during the period that the value in the \nETC is less than the alarm register value. When the ETC \nmatches the alarm value, the ALARM  pin is driven low. \nIf the AP bit is set to a 1, the ALARM output is driven \nlow during the period that the ETC is less than the alarm \nvalue.\nWhen the ETC matches the alarm value, the ALARM  pin \nbecomes high impedance. The AP bit has no affect if AOS \nis set to a 0.\nBit 0: Event Counter MSB (ECMSB).

Once the write-memory disable flag is set to \n1, the memory becomes read-only. User memory is not \nstored in EEPROM until an event becomes inactive.\n2-Wire Serial Data Bus\nThe DS1682 supports a bidirectional, 2-wire bus and \ndata-transmission protocol. A device that sends data onto \nthe bus is defined as a transmitter and a device receiving \ndata, a receiver. The device that controls the message is \ncalled a master, and the devices controlled by the master \nare slaves. A master device that generates the serial clock \n(SCL), controls the bus access, and generates the START \nand STOP conditions must control the bus. The DS1682 \noperates as a slave on the 2-wire bus. Connections to \nthe bus are made through the open-drain I/O lines SDA \nand SCL.\nThe following bus protocol has been defined ( Figure 6 ):\n ●Data transfer can be initiated only when the bus is \nnot busy.\n ●During data transfer, the data line must remain stable \nwhenever the clock line is high. Changes in the data \nline while the clock line is high are interpreted as \ncontrol signals.\nAccordingly, the following bus conditions have been \ndefined:\nBus Not Busy:  Both data and clock lines remain high.\nStart Data Transfer:  A change in the state of the data \nline, from high to low, while the clock is high,defines a START condition.\nStop Data Transfer:  A change in the state of the data \nline, from low to high, while the clock line is high, defines \nthe STOP condition.\nData Valid:  The state of the data line represents valid \ndata when, after a START condition, the data line is stable \nfor the duration of the high period of the clock signal. The \ndata on the line must be changed during the low period of \nthe clock signal. There is one clock pulse per bit of data.\nEach data transfer is initiated with a START condition \nand terminated with a STOP condition. The number of \ndata bytes transferred between START and STOP condi -\ntions are not limited, and are determined by the master \ndevice. The information is transferred byte-wise and each \nreceiver acknowledges with a ninth bit. Within the bus \nspecifications a standard mode (100kHz clock rate) and a \nfast mode (400kHz clock rate) are defined.\nAcknowledge:  Each receiving device, when addressed, \nis obliged to generate an acknowledge after it receives \neach byte. The master device must generate an extra \nclock pulse, which is associated with this acknowledge bit.\nA device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line \nduring the acknowledge clock pulse in such a way that \nthe SDA line is stable low during the high period of the \nacknowledge-related clock pulse. Of course, setup and \nhold times must be considered. A master must signal an \nend-of-data to the slave by not generating an acknowl -\nedge bit on the last byte that has been clocked out of the \nslave. In this case, the slave must leave the data line high \nto enable the master to generate the STOP condition.\nFigure 6.

The first byte transmitted by the master is the \nslave address. Next follows a number of data bytes. The \nslave returns an acknowledge bit after each received \nbyte.\nData transfer from a slave transmitter to a master \nreceiver.  The master transmits the first byte (the slave \naddress). The slave then returns an acknowledge bit. Next \nfollows a number of data bytes transmitted by the slave to \nthe master. The master returns an acknowledge bit after \nall received bytes other than the last byte. A “not acknowl -\nedge” is returned at the end of the last received byte.\nThe master device generates all of the serial clock pulses \nand the START and STOP conditions. A transfer is ended \nwith a STOP condition or with a repeated START condi -\ntion. Since a repeated START condition is also the begin -\nning of the next serial transfer, the bus is not released.\nSlave Receiver Mode (Write Mode):  Serial data and \nclock are received through SDA and SCL. After each byte \nis received, the receiver transmits an acknowledge bit. \nSTART and STOP conditions are recognized as the begin -\nning and end of a serial transfer. The slave address byte is \nthe first byte received after the master generates a START condition. The address byte contains the 7-bit DS1682 \naddress, which is 1101011 (D6h), followed by the direction \nbit (R/ W). The second byte from the master is the register \naddress. This sets the register pointer. The master then \ntransmits each byte of data, with the DS1682 acknowledg -\ning each byte received. The register pointer increments \nafter each byte is written. The master generates a STOP \ncondition to terminate the data write ( Figure 7 ).\nSlave Transmitter Mode (Read Mode):  The first byte \nis received and handled as in the slave receiver mode. \nHowever, in this mode, the direction bit indicates that the \ntransfer direction is reversed. Serial data is transmitted on \nSDA by the DS1682 while the serial clock is input on SCL. \nThe slave address byte is the first byte received after the \nmaster generates a START condition. The address byte \ncontains the 7-bit DS1682 address, followed by the direc -\ntion bit (R/ W). After receiving a valid slave address byte \nand direction bit, the DS1682 generates an acknowledge \non the SDA line. The DS1682 begins to transmit data on \neach SCL pulse starting with the register address pointed \nto by the register pointer. As the master reads each byte, \nit must generate an acknowledge. The register pointer \nincrements after each byte is read. The DS1682 must \nreceive a “not acknowledge” on the last byte to end a \nread ( Figure 8 ).\nFigure 7.
