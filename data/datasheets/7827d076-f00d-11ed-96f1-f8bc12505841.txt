The \nTPS5431 is intended to operate from power rails up to 23 V and the TPS5430 up to 36 V. These devices \nimplement constant-frequency voltage-mode control with voltage feed forward for improved line regulation and \nline transient response. Internal compensation reduces design complexity and external component count.\nThe integrated 110-m Ω high-side MOSFET supports high-efficiency power-supply designs capable of delivering \n3-A of continuous current to a load. The gate-drive bias voltage for the integrated high-side MOSFET is supplied \nby a bootstrap capacitor connected from the BOOT to PH pins. The TPS543x reduces the external component \ncount by integrating the bootstrap recharge diode.\nThe TPS543x has a default input start-up voltage of 5.3 V typical. The ENA pin can be used to disable the \nTPS543x reducing the supply current to 18 µA. An internal pullup current source enables operation when the \nENA pin is floating. The TPS543x includes an internal slow-start circuit that slows the output rise time during \nstart up to reduce in rush current and output voltage overshoot. The minimum output voltage is the internal \n1.221-V feedback reference. Output overvoltage transients are minimized by an Overvoltage Protection (OVP) \ncomparator. When the OVP comparator is activated, the high-side MOSFET is turned off and remains off until \nthe output voltage is less than 112.5% of the desired output voltage.\nInternal cycle-by-cycle overcurrent protection limits the peak current in the integrated high-side MOSFET. \nFor continuous overcurrent fault conditions the TPS543x will enter hiccup mode overcurrent limiting. Thermal \nprotection protects the device from overheating.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVIN\nUVLO\nENABLE\nThermal\nProtectionReference\nOvercurrent\nGate DriveOscillatorRamp\nGeneratorVREF\nPHENA\nGND\nBOOTZ 1\nZ2\nSHDNSHDN\nSHDNSHDNSHDNSHDN\nSHDNSHDN\nVIN\n112.5% VREFVSENSE OVPHICCUPHICCUP\nSHDNNCFeed ForwardBOOT\nNC\nPOWERPADVIN\nVOUT5 µA1.221 V BandgapSlow StartBoot\nRegulator\nError\nAmplifier\nGain = 25\nPWM\nComparator\nProtection\nGate\nDriverControlVSENSE\nCopyright © Texas Instruments Incorporatedwww.ti.comTPS5430, TPS5431\nSLVS632J – JANUARY 2006 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5430  TPS5431\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Oscillator Frequency\nThe internal free running oscillator sets the PWM switching frequency at 500 kHz. The 500 kHz switching \nfrequency allows less output inductance for the same output ripple requirement resulting in a smaller output \ninductor.\n7.3.2 Voltage Reference\nThe voltage reference system produces a precision reference signal by scaling the output of a temperature \nstable bandgap circuit. The bandgap and scaling circuits are trimmed during production testing to an output of \n1.221\u2009V at room temperature.\n7.3.3 Enable (ENA) and Internal Slow Start\nThe ENA pin provides electrical on/off control of the regulator. Once the ENA pin voltage exceeds the threshold \nvoltage, the regulator starts operation and the internal slow start begins to ramp. If the ENA pin voltage is pulled \nbelow the threshold voltage, the regulator stops switching and the internal slow start resets. Connecting the pin \nto ground or to any voltage less than 0.5 V will disable the regulator and activate the shutdown mode. The \nquiescent current of the TPS543x in shutdown mode is typically 18 μA.\nThe ENA pin has an internal pull-up current source, allowing the user to float the ENA pin. If an application \nrequires controlling the ENA pin, use open drain or open collector output logic to interface with the pin. To limit \nthe start-up inrush current, an internal slow-start circuit is used to ramp up the reference voltage from 0 V to its \nfinal value, linearly. The internal slow start time is 8 ms typically.\n7.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe TPS543x incorporate an undervoltage lockout circuit to keep the device disabled when VIN (the input \nvoltage) is below the UVLO start voltage threshold. During power up, internal circuits are held inactive and \nthe internal slow start is grounded until VIN exceeds the UVLO start threshold voltage. Once the UVLO start \nthreshold voltage is reached, the internal slow start is released and device start-up begins. The device operates \nuntil VIN falls below the UVLO stop threshold voltage. The typical hysteresis in the UVLO comparator is 330 mV.\n7.3.5 Boost Capacitor (BOOT)\nConnect a 0.01 μF low-ESR ceramic capacitor between the BOOT pin and PH pin. This capacitor provides the \ngate drive voltage for the high-side MOSFET. X7R or X5R grade dielectrics are recommended due to their stable \nvalues over temperature.\n7.3.6 Output Feedback (VSENSE) and Internal Compensation\nThe output voltage of the regulator is set by feeding back the center point voltage of an external resistor divider \nnetwork to the VSENSE pin. In steady-state operation, the VSENSE pin voltage should be equal to the voltage \nreference 1.221\u2009V.\nThe TPS543x implements internal compensation to simplify the regulator design. Since the TPS543x uses \nvoltage mode control, a type 3 compensation network has been designed on chip to provide a high crossover \nfrequency and a high phase margin for good stability. See the Internal Compensation Network  in the applications \nsection for more details.\n7.3.7 Voltage Feed-Forward\nThe internal voltage feed-forward provides a constant dc power stage gain despite any variations with the input \nvoltage. This greatly simplifies the stability analysis and improves the transient response. Voltage feed forward \nvaries the peak ramp voltage inversely with the input voltage so that the modulator and power stage gain are \nconstant at the feed forward gain, i.e.\nFeed Forward Gain /C0043VIN\nRamppk/C0042pk\n(1)TPS5430, TPS5431\nSLVS632J – JANUARY 2006 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5430  TPS5431\nThe typical feed forward gain of TPS543x is 25.\n7.3.8 Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) Control\nThe regulator employs a fixed frequency pulse-width-modulator (PWM) control method. First, the feedback \nvoltage (VSENSE pin voltage) is compared to the constant voltage reference by the high gain error amplifier and \ncompensation network to produce a error voltage. Then, the error voltage is compared to the ramp voltage by \nthe PWM comparator. In this way, the error voltage magnitude is converted to a pulse width which is the duty \ncycle. Finally, the PWM output is fed into the gate drive circuit to control the on-time of the high-side MOSFET.\n7.3.9 Overcurrent Limiting\nOvercurrent limiting is implemented by sensing the drain-to-source voltage across the high-side MOSFET. The \ndrain to source voltage is then compared to a voltage level representing the overcurrent threshold limit. If the \ndrain-to-source voltage exceeds the overcurrent threshold limit, the overcurrent indicator is set true. The system \nwill ignore the overcurrent indicator for the leading edge blanking time at the beginning of each cycle to avoid \nany turn-on noise glitches.\nOnce overcurrent indicator is set true, overcurrent limiting is triggered. The high-side MOSFET is turned off for \nthe rest of the cycle after a propagation delay. The overcurrent limiting mode is called cycle-by-cycle current \nlimiting.\nSometimes under serious overload conditions such as short-circuit, the overcurrent runaway may still happen \nwhen using cycle-by-cycle current limiting. A second mode of current limiting is used, i.e. hiccup mode \novercurrent limiting. During hiccup mode overcurrent limiting, the voltage reference is grounded and the high-\nside MOSFET is turned off for the hiccup time. Once the hiccup time duration is complete, the regulator restarts \nunder control of the slow start circuit.\n7.3.10 Overvoltage Protection\nThe TPS543x has an overvoltage protection (OVP) circuit to minimize voltage overshoot when recovering from \noutput fault conditions. The OVP circuit includes an overvoltage comparator to compare the VSENSE pin voltage \nand a threshold of 112.5% x VREF. Once the VSENSE pin voltage is higher than the threshold, the high-side \nMOSFET will be forced off. When the VSENSE pin voltage drops lower than the threshold, the high-side \nMOSFET will be enabled again.\n7.3.11 Thermal Shutdown\nThe TPS543x protects itself from overheating with an internal thermal shutdown circuit. If the junction \ntemperature exceeds the thermal shutdown trip point, the voltage reference is grounded and the high-side \nMOSFET is turned off. The part is restarted under control of the slow start circuit automatically when the junction \ntemperature drops 14°C below the thermal shutdown trip point.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Operation near Minimum Input Voltage\nThe TPS543x is recommended to operate with input voltages above 5.5 V. The typical VIN UVLO threshold \nis 5.3 V and the device may operate at input voltages down to the UVLO voltage. At input voltages below \nthe actual UVLO voltage the device will not switch. If EN is floating or externally pulled up to greater up than \n1.3 V, when V (VIN) passes the UVLO threshold the TPS543x will become active. Switching is enabled and the \nslow-start sequence is initiated. The TPS543x starts linearly ramping up the internal reference voltage from 0 V \nto its final value over the internal slow-start time period.\n7.4.2 Operation with ENA control\nThe enable start threshold voltage is 1.3 V max. With ENA held below the 0.5 V minimum stop threshold voltage \nthe TPS543x is disabled and switching is inhibited even if VIN is above its UVLO threshold. The quiescent \ncurrent is reduced in this state. If the ENA voltage is increased above the max start threshold while V (VIN) is \nabove the UVLO threshold, the device becomes active. Switching is enabled and the slow-start sequence is \ninitiated. The TPS543x starts linearly ramping up the internal reference voltage from 0 V to its final value over \nthe internal slow-start time period.www.ti.comTPS5430, TPS5431\nSLVS632J – JANUARY 2006 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5430  TPS5431\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

It is not possible to adjust the switching \nfrequency.\n8.2.1.2.3 Input Capacitors\nThe TPS5430 requires an input decoupling capacitor and, depending on the application, a bulk input capacitor. \nThe recommended value for the decoupling capacitor, C1, is 10 μF. A high quality ceramic type X5R or X7R is \nrequired. For some applications, a smaller value decoupling capacitor may be used, so long as the input voltage \nand current ripple ratings are not exceeded. The voltage rating must be greater than the maximum input voltage, \nincluding ripple.\nThis input ripple voltage can be approximated by Equation 2  :\n/C0068VIN/C0043IOUT(MAX)/C00320.25\nCBULK/C0032ƒsw/C0041/C0466IOUT(MAX)/C0032ESRMAX/C0467\n(2)\nWhere I OUT(MAX)  is the maximum load current, f SW is the switching frequency, C IN is the input capacitor value \nand ESR MAX is the maximum series resistance of the input capacitor.\nThe maximum RMS ripple current also needs to be checked. For worst case conditions, this can be \napproximated by Equation 3  :\nICIN/C0043IOUT(MAX)\n2\n(3)\nIn this case the input ripple voltage would be 156 mV and the RMS ripple current would be 1.5 A. The maximum \nvoltage across the input capacitors would be V IN max plus delta V IN/2. The chosen input decoupling capacitor is \nrated for 25 V and the ripple current capacity is greater than 3 A, providing ample margin. It is very important that \nthe maximum ratings for voltage and current are not exceeded under any circumstance.\nAdditionally some bulk capacitance may be needed, especially if the TPS5430 circuit is not located within about \n2 inches from the input voltage source. The value for this capacitor is not critical but it also should be rated to \nhandle the maximum input voltage including ripple voltage and should filter the output so that input ripple voltage \nis acceptable.TPS5430, TPS5431\nSLVS632J – JANUARY 2006 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5430  TPS5431\n8.2.1.2.4 Output Filter Components\nTwo components need to be selected for the output filter, L1 and C2. Since the TPS5430 is an internally \ncompensated device, a limited range of filter component types and values can be supported.\n8.2.1.2.4.1 Inductor Selection\nTo calculate the minimum value of the output inductor, use Equation 4 :\nLMIN/C0043VOUT(MAX)/C0032/C0466VIN(MAX)/C0042VOUT/C0467\nVIN(max)/C0032KIND/C0032IOUT/C0032FSW\n(4)\nKIND is a coefficient that represents the amount of inductor ripple current relative to the maximum output current. \nThree things need to be considered when determining the amount of ripple current in the inductor: the peak to \npeak ripple current affects the output ripple voltage amplitude, the ripple current affects the peak switch current \nand the amount of ripple current determines at what point the circuit becomes discontinuous. For designs using \nthe TPS5430, K IND of 0.2 to 0.3 yields good results. Low output ripple voltages can be obtained when paired with \nthe proper output capacitor, the peak switch current will be well below the current limit set point and relatively low \nload currents can be sourced before discontinuous operation.\nFor this design example use K IND = 0.2 and the minimum inductor value is calculated to be 12.5 μH. The next \nhighest standard value is 15 μH, which is used in this design.\nFor the output filter inductor it is important that the RMS current and saturation current ratings not be exceeded. \nThe RMS inductor current can be found from Equation 5 :\nIL(RMS)/C0043 I2\nOUT(MAX)/C00411\n12/C0032/C0466VOUT/C0032/C0466VIN(MAX)/C0042VOUT/C0467\nVIN(MAX)/C0032LOUT/C0032FSW/C00320.8/C04672/C0504\n(5)\nand the peak inductor current can be determined with Equation 6 :\nIL(PK)/C0043IOUT(MAX)/C0041VOUT/C0032/C0466VIN(MAX)/C0042VOUT/C0467\n1.6/C0032VIN(MAX)/C0032LOUT/C0032FSW\n(6)\nFor this design, the RMS inductor current is 3.003 A, and the peak inductor current is 3.31 A. The chosen \ninductor is a Sumida CDRH104R-150 15 μH. It has a saturation current rating of 3.4 A and a RMS current rating \nof 3.6 A, easily meeting these requirements. A lesser rated inductor could be used, however this device was \nchosen because of its low profile component height. In general, inductor values for use with the TPS5430 are in \nthe range of 10 μH to 100 μH.www.ti.comTPS5430, TPS5431\nSLVS632J – JANUARY 2006 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5430  TPS5431\n8.2.1.2.4.2 Capacitor Selection\nThe important design factors for the output capacitor are dc voltage rating, ripple current rating, and equivalent \nseries resistance (ESR). The dc voltage and ripple current ratings cannot be exceeded. The ESR is important \nbecause along with the inductor ripple current it determines the amount of output ripple voltage. The actual value \nof the output capacitor is not critical, but some practical limits do exist. Consider the relationship between the \ndesired closed loop crossover frequency of the design and LC corner frequency of the output filter. Due to the \ndesign of the internal compensation, it is desirable to keep the closed loop crossover frequency in the range 3 \nkHz to 30 kHz as this frequency range has adequate phase boost to allow for stable operation. For this design \nexample, it is assumed that the intended closed loop crossover frequency will be between 2590 Hz and 24 \nkHz and also below the ESR zero of the output capacitor. Under these conditions the closed loop crossover \nfrequency is related to the LC corner frequency by:\nfCO/C0043fLC2\n85 VOUT\n(7)\nAnd the desired output capacitor value for the output filter to:\nCOUT/C00431\n3357/C0032LOUT/C0032fCO/C0032VOUT\n(8)\nFor a desired crossover of 18 kHz and a 15 μH inductor, the calculated value for the output capacitor is 220 \nμF. The capacitor type should be chosen so that the ESR zero is above the loop crossover. The maximum ESR \nshould be:\nESRMAX/C00431\n2/C0112/C0032COUT/C0032fCO\n(9)\nThe maximum ESR of the output capacitor also determines the amount of output ripple as specified in the initial \ndesign parameters. The output ripple voltage is the inductor ripple current times the ESR of the output filter. \nCheck that the maximum specified ESR as listed in the capacitor data sheet results in an acceptable output \nripple voltage:\nV (MAX)□=PP(□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□) ESR x□□V x□□□□V -□□VMAX OUT IN(MAX) OUT\nN x□□V x□□LC IN(MAX) OUTx□□FSW\n(10)\nwhere\n•ΔVPP is the desired peak-to-peak output ripple.\n•NC is the number of parallel output capacitors.\n•FSW is the switching frequency.\nFor this design example, a single 220 μF output capacitor is chosen for C3. The calculated RMS ripple current \nis 143 mA and the maximum ESR required is 40 m Ω. A capacitor that meets these requirements is a Sanyo \nPoscap 10TPB220M, rated at 10 V with a maximum ESR of 40 m Ω and a ripple current rating of 3 A. An \nadditional small 0.1 μF ceramic bypass capacitor may also used, but is not included in this design.\nThe minimum ESR of the output capacitor should also be considered. For good phase margin, the ESR zero \nwhen the ESR is at a minimum should not be too far above the internal compensation poles at 24 kHz and 54 \nkHz.\nThe selected output capacitor must also be rated for a voltage greater than the desired output voltage plus one \nhalf the ripple voltage. Any derating amount must also be included. The maximum RMS ripple current in the \noutput capacitor is given by Equation 11 :TPS5430, TPS5431\nSLVS632J – JANUARY 2006 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5430  TPS5431\nICOUT(RMS)/C00431\n12/C0504/C0032/C0551/C0545\n/C0546VOUT/C0032/C0466VIN(MAX)/C0042VOUT/C0467\nVIN(MAX)/C0032LOUT/C0032FSW/C0032NC/C0551/C0547\n/C0548(11)\nwhere\n•NC is the number of output capacitors in parallel.\n•FSW is the switching frequency.\nOther capacitor types can be used with the TPS5430, depending on the needs of the application.\n8.2.1.2.5 Output Voltage Set-Point\nThe output voltage of the TPS5430 is set by a resistor divider (R1 and R2) from the output to the VSENSE pin. \nCalculate the R2 resistor value for the output voltage of 5 V using Equation 12 :\nR2/C0043R1/C00321.221\nVOUT/C00421.221\n(12)\nFor any TPS5430 design, start with an R1 value of 10 kΩ. R2 is then 3.24 kΩ.\n8.2.1.2.6 BOOT Capacitor\nThe BOOT capacitor should be 0.01 μF.\n8.2.1.2.7 Catch Diode\nThe TPS5430 is designed to operate using an external catch diode between PH and GND. The selected diode \nmust meet the absolute maximum ratings for the application: Reverse voltage must be higher than the maximum \nvoltage at the PH pin, which is V IN(MAX)  + 0.5 V. Peak current must be greater than I OUT(MAX)  plus on half the \npeak to peak inductor current. Forward voltage drop should be small for higher efficiencies. It is important to note \nthat the catch diode conduction time is typically longer than the high-side FET on time, so attention paid to diode \nparameters can make a marked improvement in overall efficiency. Additionally, check that the device chosen is \ncapable of dissipating the power losses. For this design, a Diodes, Inc. B340A is chosen, with a reverse voltage \nof 40 V, forward current of 3 A, and a forward voltage drop of 0.5 V.\n8.2.1.2.8 Advanced Information\n8.2.1.2.8.1 Output Voltage Limitations\nDue to the internal design of the TPS543x, there are both upper and lower output voltage limits for any given \ninput voltage.

These \ndesigns are based on certain assumptions and will tend to always select output capacitors within a limited \nrange of ESR values.

A value of 15 μH is chosen for this design.\nWhen using ceramic output filer capacitors, the recommended LC resonant frequency should be no more than \n7 kHz. Since the output inductor is already selected at 15 μH, this limits the minimum output capacitor value to:\nC (MIN)O/c1791\n2(2 x□□7000)□□□x□□L/c112O\n(16)\nThe minimum capacitor value is calculated to be 34 μF. For this circuit a larger value of capacitor yields better \ntransient response. A single 100 μF output capacitor is used for C3. It is important to note that the actual \ncapacitance of ceramic capacitors decreases with applied voltage. In this example, the output voltage is set to \n3.3 V, minimizing this effect.\n8.2.3.2.2 External Compensation Network\nWhen using ceramic output capacitors, additional circuitry is required to stabilize the closed loop system. For \nthis circuit, the external components are R3, C4, C6, and C7. To determine the value of these components, first \ncalculate the LC resonant frequency of the output filter:\nF =LC1\n2 L/c112O Ox□C (EFF) /c214\n(17)\nFor this example the effective resonant frequency is calculated as 4109 Hz\nThe network composed of R1, R2, R3, C5, C6, and C7 has two poles and two zeros that are used to tailor the \noverall response of the feedback network to accommodate the use of the ceramic output capacitors. The pole \nand zero locations are given by the following equations:\nFp1□□=□□500000□□xVO\nFLC\n(18)\nFz1□□=□□0.7□□x□□FLC\n(19)\nFz2□□=□□2.5□□x□□FLC\n(20)\nThe final pole is located at a frequency too high to be of concern. The second zero, fz2 as defined by Equation \n20 uses 2.5 for the frequency multiplier. In some cases this may need to be slightly higher or lower. Values in the \nrange of 2.3 to 2.7 work well. The values for R1 and R2 are fixed by the 3.3 V output voltage as calculated using \nEquation 12 . For this design R1 = 10 k Ω and R2 = 5.90 k Ω. With Fp1 = 401 Hz, Fz1 = 2876 Hz and Fz2 = 10.3 \nkHz, the values of R3, C6 and C7 are determined using Equation 21 , Equation 22 , and Equation 23 :\nC7□□=1\n2 x□□Fp1□□x□□(R1□||□□R2)/c112\n(21)\nR3□□=1\n2 x□□Fz1□□x□C7/c112\n(22)\nC6□□=1\n2 x□□Fz2□□x□R1/c112\n(23)\nFor this design, using the closest standard values, C7 is 0.1 μF, R3 is 549 Ω, and C6 is 1500 pF. C4 is added \nto improve load regulation performance. It is effectively in parallel with C6 in the location of the second pole \nfrequency, so it should be small in relationship to C6. C4 should be less the 1/10 the value of C6. For this \nexample, 150 pF works well.TPS5430, TPS5431\nSLVS632J – JANUARY 2006 – REVISED JULY 2022 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5430  TPS5431\nFor additional information on external compensation of the TPS5430, TPS5431 or other wide voltage range \ndevices, see the Using TPS5410/20/30/31 With Aluminum/Ceramic Output Capacitors  application report.\n9 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe TPS5430 is designed to operate from an input voltage supply range between 5.5 V and 36 V. The TPS5431 \nis designed to operate from an input voltage supply range between 5.5 V and 23 V. This input supply should \nremain within the input voltage supply range. If the input supply is located more than a few inches from \nthe TPS543x converter bulk capacitance may be required in addition to the ceramic bypass capacitors. An \nelectrolytic capacitor with a value of 100 μF is a typical choice.\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nConnect a low ESR ceramic bypass capacitor to the VIN pin. Care should be taken to minimize the loop area \nformed by the bypass capacitor connections, the VIN pin, and the TPS543x ground pin. The best way to do \nthis is to extend the top side ground area from under the device adjacent to the VIN trace, and place the \nbypass capacitor as close as possible to the VIN pin. The minimum recommended bypass capacitance is 4.7 μF \nceramic with a X5R or X7R dielectric.\nThere should be a ground area on the top layer directly underneath the IC, with an exposed area for connection \nto the PowerPAD. Use vias to connect this ground area to any internal ground planes. Use additional vias at the \nground side of the input and output filter capacitors as well. The GND pin should be tied to the PCB ground by \nconnecting it to the ground area under the device as shown below.\nThe PH pin should be routed to the output inductor, catch diode and boot capacitor. Since the PH connection is \nthe switching node, the inductor should be located very close to the PH pin and the area of the PCB conductor \nminimized to prevent excessive capacitive coupling. The catch diode should also be placed close to the device \nto minimize the output current loop area. Connect the boot capacitor between the phase node and the BOOT \npin as shown. Keep the boot capacitor close to the IC and minimize the conductor trace lengths. The component \nplacements and connections shown work well, but other connection routings may also be effective.\nConnect the output filter capacitor(s) as shown between the VOUT trace and GND. It is important to keep the \nloop formed by the PH pin, Lout, Cout and GND as small as is practical.\nConnect the VOUT trace to the VSENSE pin using the resistor divider network to set the output voltage. Do not \nroute this trace too close to the PH trace. Due to the size of the IC package and the device pin-out, the trace \nmay need to be routed under the output capacitor. Alternately, the routing may be done on an alternate layer if a \ntrace under the output capacitor is not desired.\nIf using the grounding scheme shown in Figure 10-1 , use a via connection to a different layer to route to the ENA \npin.www.ti.comTPS5430, TPS5431\nSLVS632J – JANUARY 2006 – REVISED JULY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TPS5430  TPS5431\n10.2 Layout Example\nBOOT\nNC\nNC\nVSENSEPH\nVIN\nGND\nENA\nVOUTPH\nVin\nTOPSIDE□GROUND AREA\nVIA to□Ground□PlaneOUTPUT\nINDUCTOR\nOUTPUT\nFILTER\nCAPACITORBOOT\nCAPACITOR\nINPUT\nBYPASS\nCAPACITORINPUT\nBULK\nFILTERCATCH\nDIODE\nSignal□VIARoute□feedback\ntrace□under□output\nfilter□capacitor□or□on\nother□layerRESISTOR\nDIVIDER\nFigure 10-1.
