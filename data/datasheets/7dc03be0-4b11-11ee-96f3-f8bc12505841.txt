### Component Summary: MCX-Right Angle Male-RG178 (Part No. 5006-0003)

#### Key Specifications:
- **Impedance:** 50 Ω
- **Frequency Range:** 0 - 3 GHz
- **Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR):** < 1.5
- **Material Composition:**
  - **Body:** Brass, Au-plated
  - **Insulator:** PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene)
  - **Pin:** Brass, Au-plated
- **Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided text.
- **RoHS Compliance:** Yes
- **Environmental Testing:** Passed 48-hour salt-spray test

#### Description:
The MCX-Right Angle Male connector is a radio frequency (RF) connector designed for use with RG178 coaxial cable. It features a right-angle configuration, which allows for space-saving connections in tight spaces. The connector is constructed from brass with gold plating, ensuring good conductivity and resistance to corrosion. The insulator is made from PTFE, which provides excellent dielectric properties.

#### Typical Applications:
The MCX-Right Angle Male connector is commonly used in various RF applications, including:
- **Telecommunications:** For connecting antennas and RF modules in communication devices.
- **Signal Processing:** In systems that require high-frequency signal transmission with minimal loss.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Used in devices such as wireless routers, GPS systems, and other RF-enabled gadgets.
- **Test Equipment:** Employed in laboratory settings for testing and measurement of RF signals.

This connector is particularly advantageous in applications where space is limited, and a straight connector would not fit. Its robust design and compliance with RoHS standards make it suitable for modern electronic applications.
