RESET  goes low whenever LL IN falls below 1.3 V or when V CC falls below\nthe V BATT input voltage. RESET  remains low for 50 ms after LL IN goes above 1.3 V,\nRESET  also goes low for 50 ms if the watchdog timer is enabled but not serviced within its\ntimeout period. The RESET  pulse width can be adjusted as shown in Table I.\nWDI 11 11 Watchdog Input, WDI is a three level input. If WDI remains either high or low for longer\nthan the watchdog timeout period, RESET  pulses low and WDO  goes low. The timer resets\nwith each transition at the WDI input. The watchdog timer is disabled when WDI is left\nfloating or is driven to midsupply.\nPFI 9 9 Power Fail Input. PFI is the noninverting input to the Power Fail Comparator when PFI is\nless than 1.3 V, PFO goes low. Connect PFI to GND or V OUT when not used. See Figure 1.\nPFO 10 10 Power Fail Output.

If LL IN is below 1.3 V, CE OUT is forced high.\nBATT ON 5 — Logic Output. BATT ON goes high when V OUT is internally switched to the V BATT input.\nIt goes low when V OUT is internally switched to V CC. The output typically sinks 7 mA and\ncan directly drive the base of an external PNP transistor to increase the output current above\nthe 100 mA rating of V OUT.\nLOW LINE 6 6 Logic Output.

It is the inverse of RESET .\nOSC SEL 8 8 Logic Oscillator Select Input. When OSC SEL is unconnected or driven high, the internal\noscillator sets the reset time delay and watchdog time-out period. When OSC SEL is low,\nthe external oscillator input, OSC IN, is enabled. OSC SEL has a 3 µA internal pullup. See\nTable I and Figure 4.\nOSC IN 7 7 Logic Oscillator Input. When OSC SEL is low, OSC IN can be driven by an external clock\nto adjust both the reset delay and the watchdog time-out period. The timing can also beadjusted by connecting an external capacitor to this pin. See Table I and Figure 4. WhenOSC SEL is high or floating, OSC IN selects between fast and slow watchdog time-out periods.\nWDO 14 14 Logic Output. The Watchdog Output, WDO , goes low if WDI remains either high or low\nfor longer than the watchdog time-out period. WDO  is set high by the next transition at\nWDI. If WDI is unconnected or at midsupply, WDO  remains high. WDO  also goes high\nwhen LOW LINE  goes low.\nNC 12 2 No Connect. It should be left open.LL\nIN 13 4 Voltage Sensing Input. The voltage on the low line input, LL IN, is compared with a 1.3 V\nreference voltage. This input is normally used to monitor the power supply voltage. Theoutput of the comparator generates a \nLOW LINE  output signal. It also generates a\nRESET/ RESET  output.\nTEST — 1 This is a special test pin using during device manufacture. It should be connected to GND.\nADM696/ADM697\nREV. 0 –5–Low Line RESE T OUTPUT\nRESET  is an active low output which provides a RESET  signal\nto the microprocessor whenever the Low Line Input (LL IN) is\nbelow 1.3 V. The LL IN input is normally used to monitor the\npower supply voltage. An internal timer holds RESET  low for\n50 ms after the voltage on LL IN rises above 1.3 V. This is in-\ntended as a power-on RESET  signal for the processor. It allows\ntime for the power supply and microprocessor to stabilize. Onpower-down, the \nRESET  output remains low with V CC as low\nas 1 V. This ensures that the microprocessor is held in a stable\nshutdown condition.\nThe LL IN comparator has approximately 12 mV of hysteresis\nfor enhanced noise immunity.\nIn addition to RESET , an active high RESET output is also\navailable. This is the complement of RESET  and is useful for\nprocessors requiring an active high RESET.\nt1\nt1 = RESET TIME\nV1 = RESET VOLTAGE THRESHOLD LOWV2 = RESET VOLTAGE THRESHOLD HIGHHYSTERESIS = V2–V1V2 V2V1 V1\nt1LLIN\nLOW LINERESET\nFigure 2. Power-Fail Reset Timing\nWatchdog Timer RESET\nThe watchdog timer circuit monitors the activity of the micro-\nprocessor in order to check that it is not stalled in an indefinite\nloop. An output line on the processor is used to toggle theWatchdog Input (WDI) line. If this line is not toggled withinthe selected timeout period, a \nRESET  pulse is generated. The\nADM696/ADM697 may be configured for either a fixed“short” 100 ms or a “long” 1.6 second timeout period or for an\nadjustable timeout period. If the “short” period is selected some\nsystems may be unable to service the watchdog timer immedi-ately after a reset, so a “long” timeout is automatically initiateddirectly after a reset is issued. The watchdog timer is restartedat the end of Reset, whether the Reset was caused by lack of ac-tivity on WDI or by LL\nIN falling below the reset threshold.\nThe normal (short) timeout period becomes effective following\nthe first transition of WDI after RESET  has gone inactive. The\nwatchdog timeout period restarts with each transition on theWDI pin. To ensure that the watchdog timer does not time out,\neither a high-to-low or low-to high transition on the WDI pin\nmust occur at or less than the minimum timeout period. If WDIremains permanently either high or low, reset pulses will be is-sued after each timeout period (1.6 s). The watchdog monitorcan be deactivated by floating the Watchdog Input (WDI) or byconnecting it to midsupply.CIRCUIT INFORMATION\nBattery-Switchover Section (ADM696)\nThe battery switchover circuit compares V CC to the V BATT\ninput, and connects V OUT to whichever is higher. Switchover\noccurs when V CC is 50 mV higher than V BATT as V CC falls, and\nwhen V CC is 70 mV greater than V BATT as V CC rises. This\n20 mV of hysteresis prevents repeated rapid switching if V CC\nfalls very slowly or remains nearly equal to the battery voltage.\nDuring normal operation with V CC higher than V BATT, VCC is\ninternally switched to V OUT via an internal PMOS transistor\nswitch. This switch has a typical on resistance of 1.5 Ω and can\nsupply up to 100 mA at the V OUT terminal. V OUT is normally\nused to drive a RAM memory bank which may require instanta-neous currents of greater than 100 mA. If this is the case, thena bypass capacitor should be connected to V\nOUT. The capacitor\nwill provide the peak current transients to the RAM. A capaci-tance value of 0.1 µF or greater may be used.\nIf the continuous output current requirement at V\nOUT exceeds\n100 mA or if a lower V CC–VOUT voltage differential is desired,\nan external PNP pass transistor may be connected in parallelwith the internal transistor. The BATT ON output can directly\ndrive the base of the external transistor.\nA 20 Ω MOSFET switch connects the V\nBATT input to V OUT\nduring battery backup. This MOSFET has very low input-to-\noutput differential (dropout voltage) at the low current levels\nrequired for battery backup of CMOS RAM or other low power\nCMOS circuitry. The supply current in battery backup is typi-cally 0.6 µA.\nThe ADM696 operates with battery voltages from 2.0 V to V\nCC\n–0.3 V). High value capacitors, either standard electrolytic or\nthe farad-size double layer capacitors, can also be used for short-term memory backup. A small charging current of typically10 nA (0.1 µA max) flows out of the V\nBATT terminal. This cur-\nrent is useful for maintaining rechargeable batteries in a fullycharged condition. This extends the life of the backup battery\nby compensating for its self discharge current. Also note that\nthis current poses no problem when lithium batteries are usedfor backup since the maximum charging current (0.1 µA) is safe\nfor even the smallest lithium cells.\nIf the battery-switchover section is not used, V\nBATT should be\nconnected to GND and V OUT should be connected to V CC.\nVBATTVCC\nBATT ON \n(ADM691, ADM693, ADM695, ADM696)V\nOUT\n700\nmVGATE DRIVE\n100\nmV\nINTERNALSHUT DOWN SIGNALWHEN V\nBATT > (VCC + 0.7V) \nFigure 1.

Figure 4 shows the various oscillator configu-\nrations which can be used to adjust the reset pulse width andwatchdog timeout period.\nThe internal oscillator is enabled when OSC SEL is high or\nfloating. In this mode, OSC IN selects between the 1.6 second\nand 100 ms watchdog timeout periods. In either case, immedi-ately after a reset the timeout period is 1.6 s. This gives the mi-croprocessor time to reinitialize the system. If OSC IN is low,then the 100 ms watchdog period becomes effective after thefirst transition of WDI. The software should be written such\nthat the I/O port driving WDI is left in its power-up reset state\nuntil the initialization routines are completed and the micropro-cessor is able to toggle WDI at the minimum watchdog timeoutperiod of 70 ms.\nOSC INOSC SEL\nADM69x CLOCK\n0 TO 250kHz8\n7\nFigure 4a.

The voltage divider ratiocan be chosen such that the voltage at PFI falls below 1.3 Vseveral milliseconds before the +5 V power supply falls belowthe reset threshold. \nPFO  is normally used to interrupt the\nmicroprocessor so that data can be stored in RAM and the shut-\ndown procedure executed before power is lost.\nADM69xPOWER\nFAIL\nINPUT R2INPUT\nPOWER\n1.3VPFO\nPOWER\nFAILOUTPUTR1\nFigure 7.

When\nLLIN is greater than 1.3 V, CE OUT is a buffered replica of CE IN,\nwith a 5 ns propagation delay. When LL IN falls below the 1.3 V\nthreshold, an internal gate forces CE OUT high, independent of\nCE IN.\nCE OUT typically drives the CE, CS, or Write input of battery\nbacked up CMOS RAM. This ensures the integrity of the datain memory by preventing write operations when V\nCC is at an in-\nvalid level.\nIf the 5 ns typical propagation delay of CE OUT is excessive, con-\nnect CE IN to GND and use the resulting CE OUT to control a\nhigh speed external logic gate.\nADM697\nCEOUTCEIN\nLLIN LOW = 0\nLLIN OK = 1\nFigure 5.

Rechargeable Battery\nAdding Hysteresis to the Power Fail Comparator\nFor increased noise immunity, hysteresis may be added to the\npower fail comparator. Since the comparator circuit is nonin-verting, hysteresis can be added simply by connecting a resistor\nbetween the PFO output and the PFI input as shown in Fig-\nure 16. When PFO is low, resistor R3 sinks current from thesumming junction at the PFI pin. When PFO is high, the seriescombination of R3 and R4 source current into the PFI summingjunction. This results in differing trip levels for the comparator.\nAlternate Watchdog Input Drive Circuits\nThe watchdog feature can be enabled and disabled under pro-gram control by driving WDI with a 3-state buffer (Figure 17a).When three-stated, the WDI input will float thereby disablingthe watchdog timer.This circuit is not entirely foolproof, and it is possible that a\nsoftware fault could erroneously 3-state the buffer. This would\nthen prevent the ADM69x from detecting that the microproces-\nsor is no longer operating correctly.

Adding Hysteresis to the Power Fail Comparator\nmethod is to extend the watchdog period rather than disabling\nthe watchdog. This may be done under program control usingthe circuit shown in Figure 17b. When the control input is high,the OSC SEL pin is low and the watchdog timeout is set by theexternal capacitor. A 0.01 µF capacitor sets a watchdog timeout\ndelay of 100 s. When the control input is low, the OSC SEL pin\nis driven high, selecting the internal oscillator. The 100 ms or\nthe 1.6 s period is chosen, depending on which diode in Fig-ure 17b is used. With D1 inserted, the internal timeout is set at100 ms while with D2 inserted the timeout is set at 1.6 s.\nWDI\nADM69xWATCHDOG\nSTROBE\nCONTROLINPUT\nFigure 17a.

Programming the Watchdog Input\nADM696/ADM697\nREV. 0 –10–Replacing the Back-Up Battery\nWhen changing the back-up battery with system power on, spu-\nrious resets can occur when the battery is removed. This occursbecause the leakage current flowing out of the V\nBATT pin will\ncharge up the stray capacitance. If the voltage on V BATT reaches\nwithin 50 mV of V CC, a reset pulse is generated.\nIf spurious resets during battery replacement are acceptable,\nthen no action is required. If not, then one of the following solu-tions should be considered:\n1. A capacitor from V\nBATT to GND. This gives time while the\ncapacitor is charging up to change the battery. The leakagecurrent will charge up the external capacitor towards theV\nCC level. The time taken is related to the charging current,\nthe size of external capacitor and the voltage differential be-tween the capacitor and the charging voltage supply.\nt = C\nEXT × VDIFF/I\nThe maximum leakage (charging) current is 1 µA over tem-\nperature and V DIFF = V CC VBATT. Therefore, the capacitor\nsize should be chosen such that sufficient time is available tomake the battery replacement.\nC\nEXT = TREQD (1 µA/(VCC – V BATT))\nIf a replacement time of 5 s is allowed and assuming a V CC\nof 4.5 V and a V BATT of 3 V,C\nEXT = 3.33 µF\n2. A resistor from V BATT to GND. This will prevent the voltage\non V BATT from rising to within 50 mV of V CC during battery\nreplacement.\nR = (VCC – 50 mV)/1 µA\nNote that the resistor will discharge the battery slightly.\nWith a V CC supply of 4.5 V, a suitable resistor is 4.3 M Ω.\nWith a 3 V battery, this will draw around 700 nA. This willbe negligible in most cases.\nTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nADM696\nFigure 18 shows the ADM696 in a typical power monitoring,\nbattery backup application. V OUT powers the CMOS RAM.\nUnder normal operating conditions with V CC present, V OUT is\ninternally connected to V CC. If a power failure occurs, V CC will\ndecay and V OUT will be switched to V BATT, thereby maintaining\npower for the CMOS RAM.\nPower Fail RESET\nThe V CC power supply is also monitored by the Low Line In-\nput, LL IN. A RESET  pulse is generated when LL IN falls below\n1.3 V. RESET  will remain low for 50 ms after LL IN returns\nabove 1.3 V. This allows for a power-on reset and prevents re-\npeated toggling of RESET  if the V CC power supply is unstable.\nResistors R3 and R4 should be chosen to give the desired V CC\nreset threshold.\nWatchdog Timer\nThe Watchdog Timer Input (WDI) monitors an I/O line fromthe µP system. This line must be toggled once every 1.6 s to\nverify correct software execution. Failure to toggle the line indi-cates that the µP system is not correctly executing its program\nand may be tied up in an endless loop. If this happens, a reset\npulse is generated to initialize the processor.If the watchdog timer is not needed the WDI input should be\nleft floating.\nPower Fail Detector\nThe Power Fail Input, PFI, monitors the input power supply viaa resistive divider network R1 and R2. This input is intended asan early warning power fail input. The voltage on the PFI input\nis compared with a precision 1.3 V internal reference. If the in-\nput voltage drops below 1.3 V, a power fail output (PFO) signalis generated. This warns of an impending power failure and maybe used to interrupt the processor so that the system may beshut down in an orderly fashion. The resistors in the sensingnetwork are ratioed to give the desired power fail threshold volt-\nage V\nT. The threshold should be set at a higher voltage than the\nRESET threshold so that there is sufficient time available tocomplete the shutdown procedure before the processor isRESET and power is lost.\nADM696 R2R1\nPFO+5V\nVCC\nCMOS RAM\nPOWER\nI/O LINEµP NMIµP RESETµP SYSTEMµP POWER\nVOUT\nRESET\nWDIGNDPFI\nVBATT\nBATTERY+R4R3\nLLIN RESET\nFigure 18a.
