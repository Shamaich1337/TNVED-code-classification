A | Page 11 of 15 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nThe dc -to-dc converter section of the ADuM5000W  works on \nprinciples that are common to most switching power supplies.  \nIt has  a secondary side  controller architecture with isolated pulse -\nwidth modulation (PWM) feedback. V DD1 power is supplied to \nan oscillating  circuit that switches current into a chip scale air \ncore transformer. Power transferred to the secondary side is \nrectified and regulated to either 3.3 V or 5  V . The secondary  (V ISO) \nside controller regulates the output by creating a PWM control signal that is sent to the primary (V\nDD1) side by a dedicated \niCoupler data channel. The PWM modulates the oscillator circuit \nto control the power b eing sent to the secondary side. Feedback \nallows for significantly higher power and efficiency.  \nThe ADuM5000W  provides a regulation contr ol output (RC OUT) \nsignal that can be connected to other isoPower  devices. This feature \nallows a single regulator to control multiple power modules without  \ncontention. When a uxiliary power modules are present, the V ISO \npins can be connected togeth er to work as a single supply.  Because \nthere is only one feedback control path, the supplies work together \nseamlessly. The ADuM5000W  can be a source of regulation \ncontrol,  as well as being controlled by another isoPower device.  \nThere is an under voltage lockout  (UVLO)  with hysteresis in  the \nVDD1 input protection  circuit. When  the input voltage rise s above  \nthe UVLO  threshold, the dc -to-dc converter becomes active.  \nThe input voltage must be decreased below the turn -on threshold  \nby the hyster esis value  to disab le the converter. This feature has \nmany benefits in the power -up sequence  of the converter, such \nas ensuring  that the system supply rises to a minimum level \nbefore the ADuM5000W  demands current. It also prevents any \nvoltage drop due to converter current from turning the supply \noff and possi bly oscillating.  \nPCB LAYOUT \nThe ADuM5000W  digital isolator is  a 0.5 W iso Power \nintegrated  dc-to-dc converter that requires  no external interface \ncircuitry for the logic interfaces. Power supply bypassing is \nrequired at the input and output supply pins ( see Figure 14). \nThe power sup ply section of the ADuM5000W  uses a 180 MHz  \noscillator frequency to pass power efficiently through its chip \nscale transformers . In addition, the normal operation of the \ndata section of the iCoupler introduces switching transients  \non the power supply pins. Bypass capacitors are required for \nseveral operating frequencies. Noise suppression requires a low \ninductance , high frequency capacitor, whereas ripple suppression  \nand proper regulation require a large value capacitor . These \ncapacitor s are most conven iently connected between Pin 1  \nand Pin 2 for V DD1, and be tween Pin  15 and Pin 16 for V ISO. \n \n \n \n To suppress noise and reduce ripple, a parallel combination of  \nat least two capacitors is required. The recommended capacitor \nvalues are 0.1 µ F and 10 µ F. Best practice recommends  using  a \nvery low inductance ceramic c apacitor, or its equivalent , for the \nsmaller value. The total lead length between both ends of the \ncapacitor and the input power supply pin should not exceed 10 mm. Consider bypas sing between Pi n 1 and Pin 8 and \nbetween Pin  9 and Pin 16 unless both common ground pins  \nare connected together close to the package. \nVDD1\nGND 1\nNC\nRCINVISO\nGND ISO\nNC\nNC\nNCVSEL\nRCOUT\nRCSEL\nVDD1 VISO\nGND 1 GND ISO\n10971-0 11\n \nFigure 14. Recommended PCB Layout \nIn applications involving high common- mode transients, ensure  \nthat board coupling across the isola tion barrier is minimized. \nFurthermore,  design the board layout such that any coupling that \ndoes occur a ffects all pins equally on a given component side. \nFailure to ensure this can  cause voltage differentials between \npins exceeding the absolute maximum rat ings for the device  \nas specified in Table 10, thereby leading to latch -up and/or \npermanent damage.  \nThe ADuM5000W  is a power device that dissipates approxi-\nmately  1 W of power when fully loaded . Because it is not possible \nto apply  a heat sink to an isolation device, the device primarily \ndepends on heat dissipation into the PCB through the GND \npins. If the device is  used at high ambient temperatures, provide \na thermal path from the GND pins to the PCB ground plane.  \nThe board layout in Figure 14 shows enlarged pads for Pin 2 \nand Pin 8 (GND 1) and f or Pin 9 and Pin 15  (GND ISO). Imple -\nment m ultiple  vias from the pad to the ground plane to  \nsignificantly reduce the temperature  inside the chip. The \ndimensions of the expanded pads are at  the discretion of  \nthe designer and depend on the available board sp ace. \nSTART -UP BEHAVIOR \nThe ADuM5000W  does not contain a soft start circuit. Take the \nstart-up current and voltage behavior into account when designing  \nwith this device.  \nWhen power is applied to V DD1, the input switching circuit begins  \nto operate and draw current when the UVLO minimum voltage is reached. The s witching circuit drives the  maximum available \npower to the output until it reaches the regulation voltage  where \nPWM control begins. The amount of current and time this takes depends on the load and the V\nDD1 slew rate.  \n \n \nADuM5000W Data Sheet  \n \nRev. A | Page 12 of 15 With a f ast VDD1 slew rate (200 µs or less), the peak current \ndraw s up to 100 mA/V of V DD1. The input voltage goes high \nfaster than the output can turn on ; therefore,  the peak current  \nis proportiona l to the maximum input voltage.  \nWith a slow V DD1 slew rate  (in the m illisecon d range ), the in put \nvoltage does  not chang e quickly when V DD1 reaches UVLO. The \ncurrent surge is  about 300 mA because  VDD1 is nearly constant at  \nthe 2.7  V UVLO point. The behavior during start -up is similar \nto when the device load  is a short circuit ; these values are con -\nsistent with the short- circuit current shown in Figure 7 . \nWhen starting the device for V ISO = 5 V operation, d o not limit \nthe current available to the V DD1 power pin to less than 300  mA. \nThe ADuM5000W  may not be able to drive the output to the  \nregulation point if a current -limiting device clamps the V DD1 \nvoltage during startup. As a result , the ADuM5000W  can draw \nlarge amounts of current  at low voltage for extended periods.  \nThe output voltage of the ADuM5000W  device  exhibits V ISO \nover -shoot during startup. If this could potentially damage \ncomponents  attached to V ISO, then a voltage -limiting device , \nsuch as a Zener diode, can be u sed to cla mp the voltage.  \nTypical behavior is shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13. \nEMI CONSIDERATIONS  \nIt is necessary for t he dc-to-dc converter section of the \nADuM5000W  to operate at 180 MHz to allow efficient power \ntransfer through the small transformers. This creates  high \nfrequency currents that can propagate in circuit board ground \nand power planes, causing  edge  emissions and dipole radiation  \nbetween the input and output  ground planes . Grounded \nenclosures are recommended for applications that use these devices . If grounded enclosures are not possible, follow good  \nRF design practices in the layout of the PCB. See the AN-0971 \nApplication Note  for board layout recommendations.  \nTHERMAL ANALYSIS  \nThe ADuM5000W  consists of four internal silicon die , attached \nto a s plit lead frame with two die attach paddles.  For the \npurposes of thermal analysis , it is treated as a thermal unit with \nthe highest junction temperature reflected in the θ JA from Table 5 . \nThe value  of θJA is based on measurements taken with the part \nmounted on a JEDEC standard 4 -layer board with fine width \ntraces and still air. Under normal operating conditions, the \nADuM5000W  operate s at full load across the full temperature \nrange without derating the output current. However, following the recommen dations in the PCB Layout  section decreases the \nthermal resistance  to the PCB , allowing increased thermal \nmargin at high ambient temperatures. \n \n \n CURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLO AD \nPROTECTION  \nThe ADuM5000W  is protected against damag e due to excessive \npower dissipation by thermal overload protection circuits. Thermal  \noverload prot ection limits the junction temperature to a maximum  \nof 150°C (typical). Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient  \ntemperature and power dissipation) , when the junction temper -\nature starts to rise above 150°C, the PWM is turned off, which \nturn s off the output current. When the junction temperature \nfalls below 130°C (typical), the PWM turn s on again , restoring \nthe output current to its nominal value.  \nConsi der the case where a hard short from V ISO to ground occurs. \nAt first, the ADuM5000W  reaches its maximum current, which \nis proportional to the voltage applied at V DD1. Power dissipate s \non the primary side of the c onverter  (see Figure 7). If self -heating \nof the junction becomes great enough to cause its temperature to \nrise above 150°C, thermal shutdown activates, turning off the PWM and turning off the output current. As the junction temperature cools and fall s below 130°C, the PWM turns on \nand power  dissipate s again  on the primary  side of the converter , \ncausing the junction temperature to rise to  150°C  again . This \nthermal oscillation between 130°C and 150°C causes the part  \nto cycle on and off as long as the short remains at the output.  \nThermal limit protections are intended to protect the device \nagainst accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, externally limit device power dissipation to prevent  junction \ntemperatures from  exceeding  130°C.  \nPOWER CONSIDERATIONS  \nThe ADuM5000W  converter pri mary side is protected from \npre-mature operation by under voltage locko ut (UVLO) \ncircuitry . Below the minimum operating voltage, the power \nconverter holds its oscillator inactive.  \nWhen the primary side oscillator begins to operate, it transfers power to the secondary power circuits. The secondary V\nISO voltage  \nstarts below its UVLO limit  making it in active and unable to \ngenerate a regulation control signal. The primary side power oscillator is allowed to free run  under this condition , supplying \nthe maximum a mount of power to the secondary  side. \nAs the secondary  side voltage r ises to its regulatio n setpoint,  \na large inrush current transient  is present  at V\nDD1. When the \nregulation point is reached, the regulation control circuit produces  \nthe regulation control signal that modulates the oscillator on the  \nprimary side. The V DD1 current is then reduce d and is proportional  \nto the load current. The inrush current is less than the short -\ncircuit current shown in  Figure 7. The duration of the inrush \ndepends on the V ISO loading conditions and on the current  and \nvoltage  available at  the V DD1 pin. \n \n \nData Sheet  ADuM5000W \n \nRev. A | Page 13 of 15 INCREASING  AVAILABLE POWER  \nThe ADuM5000W  device  is designed to work  in combination with \nother compatible isoPower devices . The RC OUT, RC IN, and RC SEL \npins allow the ADuM5000W  to provide its PWM signal to another \ndevice through the RC OUT pin acting as a master. It can also \nreceive a PWM signal from another device through its  RC IN  \npin and act as a slave to that control signal. The RC SEL pin \nchooses whether the part act s as a master or slave device .  \nWhen the ADuM5000W  is acting as a slave, its power is \nregulated by the master device, allowing multiple iso Power \nparts to be combined in parallel while sharing the load equally. \nWhen the ADuM5000W  is configured as a m aster  or stand -\nalone unit, it generates i ts own PWM feedback signal to  \nregulate itself and slave devices.  \nThe ADuM5000W  can function as a master, slave, or stand -\nalone device. All devices in the ADuM5xxx and ADuM6xxx family can function as standalone devices. Some of these devices also function as master devices or slave devices, but  not both (see  Table 14).  \nTable 15 shows  how isoPower devices can provide many \ncombinations of data channel count and multiples of the  \nsingle unit power.  \n Table 14.

This places the part in a low power standby mode \nand reduces the current draw to a fraction of a milliamp.  \nWhen the ADuM5000W  is placed in slave mode by driving \nRC SEL low, the oscillator is controlled b y RC IN. If RC IN is held \nlow, the oscillator is shut down and the part is in low power standby mode. With no oscillator driving power to the second -\nary side, V\nISO turns off. This mode is useful for applications \nwhere an isolated subsystem may be shut down t o conserve \npower. To reactivate the power module, drive RC SEL high; the \npower supply resumes operation.  \n \nTable 15.

A | Page 14 of 15 INSULATION LIFETIME  \nAll insulation structures even tually break down when subjected \nto voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insu-\nlation degradation is depende nt on the characteristics of the \nvoltage waveform applied across the insulation. In addition to \nthe testing performed by the r egulatory agencies, Analog Devices \ncarries out an extensive set of evaluations to determine the life-time of the insulation structure within the ADuM5000W . \nAnalog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage \nlevels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Acce l-\neration factors for several operating conditions are determined. These factors allow calculation of the  time to failure at the actual  \nworking voltage. The values shown in Table 11 summarize the \npeak voltage for 50 years of service life for a bipolar ac oper ating \ncondition, and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working voltages. In many cases, the approved working voltage is higher \nthan 50 -year service life voltage. Operation at these high work -\ning voltages can lead to shortened insulation life in some cases. \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM5000W  depends on the \nvoltage  waveform imposed across the isol ation barrier. The \niCoupler insulation structure degrades at different rates \ndepending on whether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac,  \nor dc. Figure 15, Figure 16, and Figure 17 illustrate these \ndifferent isolation voltage waveforms.  \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. The goal of a 50 -year operating lifetime under the ac bipolar condition \ndetermines the maximum  working voltage that Analog Devices \nrecommends . In the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insula -\ntion is significantly  lower. This allows operation at higher working  \nvoltages while still achieving a 50 -year service life. The working \nvoltages listed in Table 11 can be applied while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime , provided the voltage conforms to \neither the unipolar ac or dc voltage cases. Treat a ny cross insu -\nlation voltage waveform that does not confo rm to Figure 16 or \nFigure 17 as a bipolar ac waveform and limit its peak voltage to  \nthe 50 -year lifetime voltage value listed in Table 11. The voltage \npresented in Figure 16 is shown as sinusoidal for illustration  \npurposes only. It is meant to represent any voltage waveform varying between 0 V and some limiting value. The limiting value can be positive or negative, but the voltage cannot cross 0  V. \n \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n10971-021 \nFigure 15.
