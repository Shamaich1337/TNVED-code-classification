At \npower on, the I/Os are configured as inputs with a \nweak pullup to V CC. However, the system controller \ncan enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by \nwriting to the I/O configuration bits. If no signals are \napplied externally to the PCA9536, the voltage level \nis 1, or high, because of the internal pullup resistors. \nThe data for each input or output is stored in the \ncorresponding Input Port or Output Port register. The \npolarity of the Input Port register can be inverted \nwith the Polarity Inversion register and the system \ncontroller reads all registers.\nThe system controller resets the PCA9536 in the \nevent of a timeout or other improper operation by \nutilizing the power-on reset feature, which puts the \nregisters in their default state and initializes the I2C/\nSMBus state machine.\nThe device outputs (latched) have high-current drive \ncapability for directly driving LEDs, but has low current \nconsumption.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nPCA9536SOIC (8) 4.90 mm × 3.91 mm\nVSSOP (8) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the datasheet.\nI2C or SMBus Controller\n(e.g. Processor) PCA9536\nGNDSCLSDAVCC\nP0\nP1\nP2\x01\x02RESET, ENABLE, or \ncontrol inputs\n\x01\x02INT or status outputs\n\x01\x02LEDs\n\x01\x02ButtonsPeripheral Devices\nP3\nSimplified SchematicPCA9536\nSCPS125H  – APRIL 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

It \nprovides general-purpose remote I/O expansion for most microcontroller families through the I2C interface.\nThe PCA9536  consists of a configuration (input or output selection), Input Port, Output Port, and Polarity \nInversion (active-high or active-low operation) registers. At power-on, the I/Os are configured as inputs. The \nsystem controller enables the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration register bits. The \ndata for each input or output is kept in the corresponding input or output register. The polarity of the Input Port \nregister can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register and the system controller reads all registers.\nThe device outputs (latched) have high-current drive capability for directly driving LEDs.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nInput\nFilterI2C Bus\nControlShift\nRegister4 Bits I/O\nPortP3-P0\nPower-On\nResetSCL\nSDA\nVCC\nGNDWrite Pulse\nRead Pulse\n8\n46\n7\nFigure 8-1.

Simplified Schematic Of P0 To P3\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 I/O Port\nWhen an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 (in Figure 8-2 ) are off, creating a high-impedance input \nwith a weak pullup (100 kΩ typical) to V CC. The input voltage may be raised above V CC to a maximum of 5.5 V.\nIf the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the output port register. \nIn this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and either V CC or GND. The external voltage \napplied to this I/O pin should not exceed the recommended levels for proper operation.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Power-On Reset\nWhen power (from 0 V) is applied to V CC, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9536 in a reset condition until \nVCC has reached V POR. At that time, the reset condition is released and the PCA9536 registers and I2C/SMBus \nstate machine initialize to their default states. After that, V CC must be lowered to below 0.2 V and then back up to \nthe operating voltage for a power-reset cycle.\nRefer to the Section 10.1 section.\n8.4.2 Powered-Up\nWhen power has been applied to V CC above V PORR , and the POR has taken place, the device is in a functioning \nmode. In this state, the device is ready to accept any incoming I2C requests and monitors for changes on the \ninput ports.\n8.5 Programming\n8.5.1 I2C Interface\nThe bidirectional I2C bus consists of the serial clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA) lines. Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply through a pullup resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data \ntransfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\nI2C communication with this device is initiated by a controller sending a Start condition, which is a high-to-low \ntransition on the SDA input and output while the SCL input is high (see Figure 8-3 ). After the Start condition, the \ndevice address byte is sent, most-significant bit (MSB) first, including the data direction bit (R/ W).\nAfter receiving the valid address byte, this device responds with an acknowledge (ACK), a low on the SDA input \nand output during the high of the ACK-related clock pulse.www.ti.comPCA9536\nSCPS125H – APRIL 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9536\nOn the I2C bus, only one data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain \nstable during the high pulse of the clock period, as changes in the data line at this time are interpreted as control \ncommands (Start or Stop) (see Figure 8-4 ).\nA Stop condition, a low-to-high transition on the SDA input and output while the SCL input is high, is sent by the \ncontroller (see Figure 8-3 ).\nAny number of data bytes can be transferred from the transmitter to receiver between the Start and the Stop \nconditions. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one ACK bit. The transmitter must release the SDA line before \nthe receiver can send an ACK bit. The device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the ACK \nclock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable low during the high pulse of the ACK-related clock period (see Figure \n8-5). When a target receiver is addressed, it must generate an ACK after each byte is received. Similarly, the \ncontroller must generate an ACK after each byte that it receives from the target transmitter. Setup and hold times \nmust be met to ensure proper operation.\nA controller receiver signals an end of data to the target transmitter by not generating an acknowledge (NACK) \nafter the last byte has been clocked out of the target. This is done by the controller receiver, by holding the SDA \nline high. In this event, the transmitter must release the data line to enable the controller to generate a Stop \ncondition.\nSDA\nSCL\nS P\nStart Condition Stop Condition\nFigure 8-3.

When it is high (1), a read \nis selected, while a low (0) selects a write operation.\n8.6.2 Control Register and Command Byte\nFollowing the successful acknowledgment of the address byte, the bus controller sends a command byte that is \nstored in the control register in the PCA9536. Two bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) and \nthe internal register (Input, Output, Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. This register can be \nwritten or read through the I2C bus. The command byte is sent only during a write transmission.www.ti.comPCA9536\nSCPS125H – APRIL 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9536\nOnce a command byte has been sent, the addressed register is continuosly accessed by reads until a new \ncommand byte is sent.\nFigure 8-7  shows the PCA9536 control register bits and Table 8-2  shows the command byte.\n0 0 0 0 0 0 B1 B0\nFigure 8-7.

The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is accessed. After a \nrestart, the device address is sent again but, this time, the LSB is set to a logic 1. Data from the register defined \nby the command byte then is sent by the PCA9536 (see Figure 8-10  and Figure 8-11 ). After a restart, the value \nof the register defined by the command byte matches the register being accessed when the restart occurred. \nData is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse.

The LED acts as a diode so, when the LED is off, the I/O V IN is about 1.2 V less than V CC. \nThe supply current, I CC, increases as V IN becomes lower than V CC and is specified as ΔICC in Electrical \nCharacteristics .\nDesigns needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications, should consider \nmaintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to V CC when the LED is off.

By-pass and de-coupling capacitors \nare commonly used to control the voltage on the VCC pin, using a larger capacitor to provide additional power \nin the event of a short power supply glitch and a smaller capacitor to filter out high-frequency ripple. These \ncapacitors must be placed as close to the PCA9536  as possible.\nFor the layout example provided, it would be possible to fabricate a PCB with only 2 layers by using the top layer \nfor signal routing and the bottom layer as a split plane for power (VCC) and ground (GND). However, a 4-layer \nboard is preferable for boards with higher density signal routing. On a 4-layer PCB, it is common to route signals \non the top and bottom layer, dedicate one internal layer to a ground plane, and dedicate the other internal layer \nto a power plane. In a board layout using planes or split planes for power and ground, vias are placed directly \nnext to the surface mount component pad which needs to attach to VCC or GND and the via is connected \nelectrically to the internal layer or the other side of the board. Vias are also used when a signal trace needs to be \nrouted to the opposite side of the board, but this technique is not demonstrated.\n11.2 Layout Example\nP1\nP2P0\nGNDSDA\nSCLVCC\nP3PCA9536CAPGND\nFigure 11-1.
