General description\nThe 74LVC244A; 74LVCH244A are 8-bit buffer/line drivers with 3-state outputs. The devices can\nbe used as two 4-bit buffers or one 8-bit buffer. Both devices features two output enables (1OE and\n2OE), each controlling four of the 3-state outputs. A HIGH on n OE causes the outputs to assume\na high-impedance OFF-state. Inputs can be driven from either 3.3 V or 5 V devices. This feature\nallows the use of these devices as translators in mixed 3.3 V and 5 V environments.\nSchmitt-trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant of slower input rise and fall times.\nThis device is fully specified for partial power down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing the potentially damaging backflow current through the device when\nit is powered down.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 1.2 V to 3.6 V\n•CMOS low-power consumption\n•Direct interface with TTL levels\n•Overvoltage tolerant inputs to 5.5 V\n•IOFF circuitry provdes partial Power-down mode operation\n•Bus hold on all data inputs (74LVCH244A only)\n•Complies with JEDEC standard:\n•JESD8-7A (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n•JESD8-5A (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8-C/JESD36 (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115B exceeds 200 V\n•CDM JESD22-C101E exceeds 1000 V\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\nNexperia 74LVC244A; 74LVCH244A\nOctal buffer/line driver; 3-state\n3.

#### Description:
The **74LVC244APW** is an octal buffer/line driver with 3-state outputs, designed for use in digital circuits. It can function as either two 4-bit buffers or one 8-bit buffer, making it versatile for various applications. The device features two output enable inputs (1OE and 2OE), allowing control over four outputs each. The Schmitt-trigger inputs enhance the device's ability to handle slower input signals, making it suitable for mixed-voltage environments (3.3 V and 5 V).

#### Typical Applications:
- **Data Communication:** The 74LVC244A can be used to drive signals between different voltage levels, making it ideal for interfacing between 3.3 V and 5 V logic devices.
- **Signal Conditioning:** It is commonly used in applications requiring signal buffering to improve signal integrity and drive capability.
- **Bus Systems:** The device can be employed in bus systems where multiple devices share the same communication lines, thanks to its 3-state outputs.
- **Power Management:** The I_OFF feature allows for safe operation in power-down modes, preventing backflow current, which is crucial in battery-operated devices.

This component is particularly useful in applications where low power consumption and high-speed operation are required, such as in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and industrial automation systems.
