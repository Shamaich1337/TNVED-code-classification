When \nthe feedback voltage falls below the feedback \nreference voltage, the minimum off -time one -shot \n(200ns, typ.) has timed out and  the inductor current is \nbelow the current limit threshold, then the internal \non-time one -shot circuitry is triggered and the high -side \nswitch is turn -on. Since the minimum off -time is short, \nthe device exhibits ultrafast transient response and \nenables the  use of smaller output capacitance.  \nThe on -time is inversely proportional to input voltage \nand directly proportional to output voltage to achieve \npseudo -fixed frequency over the input voltage range. \nAfter the on -time one -shot timer expired, the high -side \nswitch is turn ed off and the low -side switch is turn ed on \nuntil the on -time one -shot is triggered again. To \nachieve stable operation with low -ESR ceramic output \ncapacitors, an internal ramp signal is added to the \nfeedback reference voltage to simulate the output \nvoltage ripple.  \nPower Saving Mode  (RT62 63A Only)  \nThe RT62 63A automatically enters power saving mode \n(PSM) at light load to maintain high efficiency. As the \nload current decreases , the inductor current ripple \nvalley eventually  touches the zero curren t, which is the \nboundary between continuous conduction and \ndiscontinuous conduction modes. The low -side switch \nis turned off when the zero inductor current is detected. \nIn this case, the output capacitor is only discharged by \nload current so that the switc hing frequency decreases. \nAs the result, the light -load efficiency can be enhanced \ndue to lower switching loss.  \nEnable Control  \nThe RT6263A/B  provides an EN pin, as an external \nchip enable control, to enable or disable the device. If VEN is held below a logic -low threshold voltage (V EN_L) \nof the enable input (EN), the converter will disable \noutput voltage, that is, the converter is disabled and \nswitching is inhibited even if the VIN voltage is above \nVIN under -voltage lockout threshold (V UVLO). During \nshutdown mode, the supply current can be reduced to \nISHDN  (10\uf06dA or below). If the EN voltage rises above \nthe logic -high threshold voltage (V EN_H ) while the VIN \nvoltage is higher than UVLO threshold, the device will \nbe turned on, that is, switc hing being enabled and \nsoft-start sequence being initiated. An internal resistor \nREN_DN  from EN to GND allows EN float to shutdown \nthe c hip. \nSoft-Start (SS)  \nThe soft -start function is used to prevent large inrush \ncurrents while the converter is being power ed up. The \nRT6263A/B provides an SS pin so that the soft -start \ntime can b e programmed by selecting the value of the \nexternal soft -start capacitor C SS connected from the \nSS pin to GND. During the start -up sequence, the \nsoft-start capacitor is charged by an internal current \nsource I SS (typically, 6 \uf06dA) to generate a soft -start ramp \nvoltage , and the internal reference voltage follows this \nslew rate. The out voltage can be built smoothly due to \nthe method described above, so the SS pin should not \nbe left unconne cted to prevent overshoot voltage in \nsoft-start interval. After the SS pin voltage rises above \n1.9V (typically) and V FB reaches 90% of reference \nvoltage, the open -drain output of PGOOD will be high \nimpedance to indicate power -good status. The typical \nstart-up waveform shown below indicates the \nsequence and timing between the output voltage and \nrelated voltage.  \n \nRT6263A/B    \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The logic delay of comparator prevents false \nflag as a short excursion occurs, such as line and load \ntransie nts. Tie PGOOD to VOUT or an external voltage \nwhich is below 5.5V.  The power -good function is \nactivated after soft -start is finished and controlled by a \ncomparator connected to the feedback signal V FB. \nAfter a certain delay time that V FB reaches the \npower -good high threshold (V TH_PGLH ) (typically 90% \nof the reference voltage), the PGOOD pin becomes \nhigh impedance to hold V PGOOD  logic high. On the \ncontrary , the PGOOD pin is forced to logic -low while \nVFB falls to the power -good low threshold (V TH_PGHL ) \n(typically 85% of the reference voltage). Furthermore, \nthis pin is also forced to logic -low as any internal \nprotection is triggered.  The power good indication \nprofile is shown below.  \n VTH_PGLH\n  VTH_PGHL\nVFB\nVPGOOD\n \nInput Under -Voltage Lockout  \nIn addition to the EN pin, the RT6263A/B also provides \nenable control through the VIN pin. It features an \nunder -voltage lockout (UVLO) function that monitors  \nthe internal linear regulator (VCC). If V EN rises above \nVEN_H  first, switching will still be inhi bited until the VIN voltage rises above V UVLO . It is to ensure that the \ninternal regulator is ready so that operation with \nnot-fully-enhanced internal MOSFET switches can be \nprevented. After the device is powered up, if the input \nvoltage VIN goes below the  UVLO falling threshold \nvoltage (V UVLO  \uf02d \uf044VUVLO ), this switching will be \ninhibited; if VIN rises above the UVLO rising threshold \n(VUVLO ), the device will resume normal operation with a \ncompl ete soft -start.  \nOutput Under -Voltage Protection and Hiccup Mode  \nThe RT6263A/B possesses  output under -voltage \nprotection (UVP) against over -load or short -circuited \ncondition by constantly monitoring the feedback \nvoltage V FB. If V FB drops below the under -voltage \nprotection trip threshold (typically 65% of the internal \nfeedback reference voltage), the UV comparator will go \nhigh to turn off both internal high -side and low -side \nMOSFET switches. If the output under -voltage \ncondition continues for a period of time, the RT6263A/B \nwill enter output under -voltage protection with hiccup \nmode. During hiccup mode, the IC will shut down for \ntHICCUP_OFF , \ntHICCUP_OFF  = CSS x 1.2V/0.86 \uf06dA \n, and then attempt to recover automatically for \ntHICCUP_ON , \ntHICCUP_ON  = CSS x 1.2V/6\uf06dA. \nUpon completion of the soft -start sequence, the \nconverter will resume normal operation if the fault \ncondition is removed; otherwise , the RT6263 A/B stays \nin auto -recovery until the fault condition is cleared.  \nThe hiccup mode allows the circuit to operate sa fely \nwhile over -load or short -circuit condition occurs, and it \nmakes converter resume normal operation rapidly once \nthe fault condition is gone.  \nAbnormal case \ndetected(UV)\nVOUT\nSWResume normal\noperation\nFault condition\nremoved\ntSStHICCUP_ON = CSS x 1.2V/6μA\ntHICCUP_OFF = CSS x 1.2V/0.86μA\nt\nt\n  \n   RT6263A/B  \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The switch current is compared with the \nhigh-side switch peak -current limit (I LIM_H ) after a \ncertain amount of delay when the high -side sw itch \nbeing turned on each cycle. If an over -current condition \noccurs, the converter will immediately turns off the \nhigh-side switch and turns on the low -side switch to \nprevent the inductor current exceeding the high -side \ncurrent limit.  \nThe low -side MOSFET over-current protection is \nachieved by measuring the inductor current through the \nsynchronous rectifier (low -side switch) during the \nlow-side on -time. Once the current rises above the \nlow-side switch valley current limit (I LIM_L ), the on -time \none-shot will  be inhibited until the inductor current \nramps down to the current limit level (I LIM_L ), that is, \nanother on -time can only be triggered when the \ninductor current goes below the low -side current limit. If \nthe output load current exceeds the available induct or \ncurrent (clamped by the low -side current limit), the \noutput capacitor needs to supply the extra current such \nthat the output voltage will begin to drop. If it drops \nbelow the output under -voltage protection trip threshold, \nthe IC will stop switching to avoid excessive heat.  \nNegative Over -Current Limit  \nThe RT62 63B is the part which is forced to PWM and \nallows negative current operation.  \nIn case of PWM operation, high negative current may \nbe generated as an external power source which is tied \nto output ter minal unexpectedly.  \nAs the risk described above, the internal circuit \nmonitors negative current in each on -time interval of \nlow-side MOSFET and compares it with NOC \nthreshold.  Once the negative current exceeds the NOC threshold, \nthe low -side MOSFET is tur ned off immediately, and \nthen the high -side MOSFET will be turned on to \ndischarge the energy of output inductor. This behavior \ncan keep the valley of negative current at NOC \nthreshold to protect low -side MOSFET. However, the \nnegative current can’t be limit ed at NOC threshold \nanymore since minimum off -time is reached.  \nThermal Shutdown  \nThe RT6263A/B  includes an over -temperature \nprotection (OTP) circuitry to prevent overheating due to \nexcessive power dissipation. The OTP will shut down \nswitching operation when junction temperature \nexceeds a thermal shutdown threshold  (TSD). Once the \njunction temperatu re cools down by a thermal \nshutdown hysteresis  (\uf044TSD), the IC will resume normal \noperation with a complete soft -start.  \nNote that the over temperature protection is intended to \nprotect the device during momentary overload \nconditions. The protection is activated outside of the \nabsolute maximum range of operation as a secondary \nfail-safe and therefore  should not be relied upon \noperationally. Continuous operation above the \nspecified absolute maximum operating junction \ntemperature may impair the reliability  of the device  or \npermanently damage the device . \nDischarge  \nThe RT6263 A/B features the discharge function to \nrelease the  output power the condition that EN pin \ngoes low, UVP and OTP. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRT6263A/B    \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The switching frequency, input \nvoltage, output voltage, and selected inductor ripple \ncurrent determines the inductor value as follows :  \n\uf028 \uf029 OUT IN OUT\nIN SW LV V VL = V f I\uf0b4\uf02d\n\uf0b4 \uf0b4\uf044\n \nOnce an inductor value is chosen, the ripple current \n(\uf044IL) is calculated to determine the re quired peak \ninductor current.  \n\uf028 \uf029 OUT IN OUTLL L(PEAK) OUT(MAX)\nIN SWV V V II =  and I  = IV f L 2\uf0b4\uf02d \uf044\uf044\uf02b\uf0b4\uf0b4\n \nIL(PEAK)  should not exceed the minimum value of IC's \nupper current limit level. Besides, the current flowing \nthrough the inductor is the inductor rip ple current plus \nthe output current. During power up, faults , or transient \nload conditions, the inductor current can increase \nabove the calculated peak inductor current level \ncalculated above. In transient conditions, the inductor \ncurrent can increase up to the switch current limit of the \ndevice. For this reason, th e most conservative \napproach is to specify an inductor with a saturation \ncurrent rating which is equal to or greater than the \nswitch current limit rather than the peak inductor \ncurrent.  \nConsidering the Typical Application Circuit  for 1.2V \noutput at 3A and an input voltage of 12V, using an \ninductor ripple of 1A (33% of the IC rated current ), the \ncalculated inductance value is :  \n\uf028\uf029 1.2 12 1.2L 1.66 μH12 650kHz 1A\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d\uf03d\uf0b4\uf0b4 \nFor the typical application, a standard inductance value \nof 1.5\uf06dH can be selected.  \n\uf028\uf029\nL1.2 12 1.2I =  = 1.1A (37% of the IC rated current)12 650kHz 1.5 μH\uf0b4\uf02d\uf044\uf0b4\uf0b4\nL(PEAK)1.1Aand I  = 3A +  = 3.55A2\n \nFor the 1.5\uf06dH value, the inductor's saturation and \nthermal rating should exceed at least 3.55A. For more \nconservative, the rating for inductor saturation current \nmust be equal to or greater than switch current limit of \nthe de vice rather than the inductor peak current.  \nFor EMI sensitive application, choosing shielding type \ninductor is preferred.  \nInput Capacitor Selection  \nInput capacitance, C IN, is needed to filter the pulsating \ncurrent at the drain of the high -side power MOSFET . \nCIN should be sized to do this without causing a large \nvariation in input voltage. The waveform of C IN ripple \nvoltage and ripple current are shown in Figure 1. The \npeak -to-peak voltage ripple on input capacitor can be \nestimated as the equation below :  \nCIN OUT OUT\nIN SW1DV = D I  + I ESRCf \uf02d\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf044 \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0b4\uf0e8\uf0f8\n \nwhere \nOUT\nINVD = Vη\uf0b4\n \nFor ceramic capacitors, the equivalent series \nresistance (ESR) is very low, the ripple which is caused \nby ESR can be ignored, and the mini mum input \ncapacitance can be estimated as the equatio n below :  \n\uf028\uf029\nIN_MIN OUT_MAX\nCIN_MAX SWD 1 DC  IVf =\uf02d\uf0b4\uf044\uf0b4\n \nCIN_MAX where V mV  200 \uf044 \uf0a3\n \nRT6263A/B    \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

C IN Ripple Voltage and Ripple Current  \nIn addition, the input capacitor needs to have a very \nlow ESR and must be rated to handl e the worst -case \nRMS input current of :  \nOUT INRMS OUT_MAX\nIN OUTV VI  I 1VV\uf040 \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d\n \nIt is commonly to use the worse I RMS \uf040 IOUT/2 at V IN = \n2VOUT for design.  Note that ripple current ratings from \ncapacitor manufacturers are often based on only 2000 \nhours of life which makes it advisable to further de -rate \nthe capacitor, or choose a capacitor rated at a higher \ntemperature than required.  \nSeveral capacitors may a lso be paralleled to meet size, \nheight and thermal requirements in the design. For low \ninput voltage applications, sufficient bulk input \ncapacitance is needed to minimize transient effects \nduring output load changes.  \nCeramic capacitors are ideal for switch ing regulator \napplications because of its small size, robustness, and \nvery low ESR.  However, care must be taken when \nthese capacitors are used at the input. A ceramic input \ncapacitor combined with trace or cable inductance \nforms a high quality (under dampe d) tank circuit. If the \nRT6263A/B circuit is plugged into a live supply, the \ninput voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, \npossibly exceeding the device’s rating. This situation is \neasily avoided by placing the low ESR ceramic input \ncapacitor in paral lel with a bulk capacitor with higher \nESR to damp the voltage ringing.  \nThe input capacitor should be placed as close as \npossible to the VIN pins, with a low inductance \nconnection to the GND of the IC. In addition to a larger \nbulk capacitor, a small ceramic  capacitors of 0.1 \uf06dF \nshould be placed close to the VIN and GND pin. This capacitor should be 0402 or 0603 in size.  \nOutput Capacitor Selection  \nThe RT6263A/B  are optimized for ceramic output \ncapacitors and best performance will be obtained using \nthem. The total output capacitance value is usually \ndetermined by the desired output voltage ripple level and \ntransient response requirements for sag (undershoot on \npositive load steps) and soar (overshoot on negative \nload steps).   \nOutput Ripple  \nThe output voltage ripple at the switching frequency is \na function of the inductor current ripple going through \nthe output capacitor’s impedance. To derive the output \nvoltage ri pple, the output capacitor with capacitance \n(COUT) and its equivalent series resistance (R ESR) \nmust be taken into consideration. The output \npeak -to-peak ripple voltage (V RIPPLE ) caused by the \ninductor current ripple ( \uf044IL) is characterized by two \ncomponents , which are ESR ripple (V RIPPLE(ESR) ) and \ncapacitive ripple (V RIPPLE(C) ), and can be expressed as \nbelow :  \nRIPPLE RIPPLE(ESR) RIPPLE(C)\nRIPPLE(ESR) L ESR\nLRIPPLE(C)\nOUT SWV  = V V\nV  = I R\nIV  = 8 C f\uf02b\n\uf044\uf0b4\n\uf044\n\uf0b4\uf0b4\n \nAs ceramic capacitors are used, both parameters \nshould be estimated due to the extremely low ESR and \nrelatively small capac itance. Refer to the RT6263A/B's \ntypical application circuit of 1.2V application, the actual \ninductor current ripple ( \uf044IL) is 1.1A, and the output \ncapacitor is 22 \uf06dF (Murata ceramic capacitor: \nGRM219R60J226ME47), V RIPPLE  can be obtained as \nbelow.  \nThe ripple  caused by ESR (2m \uf057) can be calculated \nas : \n\uf028\uf029 RIPPLE ESRV = 1.1A 2m  = 2  .2mV \uf0b4\uf057\n \nConsidering the capacitance derating, the effective \ncapacitance is approximately 18 \uf06dF as the output \nvoltage is 1.2V, and another parameter is :  \n\uf028\uf029 RIPPLE C\nRIPPLE1.1AV =  = 5.9mV8 2 18μF 650kHz\nV = 2.2mV + 5.9mV = 8 m \n1  .V\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4\n \n   RT6263A/B  \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The ACOT® transient \nrespon se is very quick and output transients are \nusually small.  The following section shows how to \ncalculate the worst -case voltage swings in response to \nvery fast load steps.   \nBoth undershoot voltage and overshoot voltage consist \nof two factors  : the voltage st eps caused by the output \ncapacitor's ESR, and the voltage sag and soar due to \nthe finite output capacitance and the inductor current \nslew rate. Use the following formulas to check if the \nESR is low enough (typically not a problem with \nceramic capacitors) a nd the output capacitance is large \nenough to prevent excessive sag and soar on very fast \nload step edges, with the chosen inductor value.  \nThe amplitude of the ESR step up or down is a function \nof the load step and the ESR of the output capacitor  : \nVESR _ST EP = \uf044IOUT x RESR \nThe amplitude of the capacitive sag is a function of the \nload step, the output capacitor value, the inductor value, \nthe input -to-output voltage  differential, and the \nmaximum duty cycle. The maximum duty cycle during a \nfast transient is a function of the on -time and the \nminimum off -time since the ACOT® control scheme will \nramp the current using on -times spaced apart with \nminimum off -times, which i s as fast a s allowed. \nCalculate the approximate on -time (neglecting \nparasites) and maximum duty cycle for a given input \nand output voltage as :  \nOUT ONON MAX\nIN SW ON OFF_MINVtt  =  and D  = V f t t\uf0b4\uf02b\n \nThe real on -time will slightly extend due to the voltage \ndrop which is related to out put current; however, this \non-time compensation can be neglected.  Besides, the \nminimum on -time is 60ns, typ. If the calculated on -time \nis smaller than minimum on -time, it and V OUT will both \nbe clamped.  Calculate the output voltage sag as :  \n\uf028 \uf0292OUTSAG\nOUT IN(MIN) MAX OUTL ( I )V  = 2 C V D V\uf0b4\uf044\n\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d\n \nThe amplitude of the capacitive soar is a function of the load step, the output capacitor value, the inductor value \nand the output voltage :  \n2OUTSOAR\nOUT OUTL ( I )V  = 2 C V\uf0b4\uf044\n\uf0b4\uf0b4\n \nBecause  some modern digital loads can exhibit nearly \ninstantaneous load changes, the amplitude of the ESR \nshould be taken into consideration while calculating the \nVSAG & VSOAR . \nOutput Voltage Setting  \nSet the desired output voltage using a resistive divider \nfrom t he output to ground with the midpoint connected \nto FB. The output voltage is set according  to the \nfollowing equation :  \nVOUT = 0.765V x (1 + R FB1 / RFB2) \nRT6263A/B\nGNDFBRFB1\nRFB2VOUT\n \nFigure 2 . Output Voltage Setting  \nPlace the FB resistors within 5mm of the FB pin. \nChoose R FB2 between 10k \uf057 and 100k \uf057 to minimize \npower consumption without excessive noise pick -up \nand calculate R FB1 as follows :  \nFB2 OUT REFFB1\nREFR (V V )RV\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d\n \nFor output voltage accuracy, use divider resistors with \n1% or better tolerance.  \nFeed -forward  Capacitor Selection (C FF) \nThe RT6263A/B is optimized for low duty -cycle \napplication s and the control loop is stable with low ESR \nceramic output capacitors. In higher duty -cycle \napplications (higher output voltages or lower input \nvoltage s), the intern al ripple signal will increase in \namplitude. Before the ACOT® control loop can react to \nan output voltage fluctuation, the voltage change on the \nfeedback signal must exceed the internal ripple \namplitude. Because of the large internal ripple in this \ncondition, the response may become slower and \nunder -damped.

This increases the damping \nof the control system.  \nGNDFBRFB1\nRFB2VOUT\nRT6263A/BSWL\nCFF COUT\n \nFigure 3. Feedback Loop with Feedforward Capacitor  \nLoop stability can be checked by viewing the load \ntransient response. A load step with a speed that \nexceed s the converter bandwidth must be applied. For \nACOT®, loop bandwidth can be in the order of 100 ~ \n200kHz, so a load step with 500ns maximum ris ing \ntime (dI/dt \uf0bb 2A/\uf06ds) ensures the excitation frequency is \nsufficient. It is important that  the converter operates in \nPWM mode, outside the light load efficiency range, and \nbelow any current limit threshold. A load transient from \n30% to 60% of maximum load is reasonable which  is \nshown in Figure 4.  \n30% Load60% LoadfCO\n \nFigure 4. Example of Measuring the Converter BW by \nFast Load Transient  \nCFF can be calculated basing on below equation :  \nFF\nFB1 FB1 FB21 1 1 1C =  + 2 BW R R R\uf070\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0b4\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0b4 \uf0e8\uf0f8\n \nFigure 5. shows the transient performance with and \nwithout feedfoward capacitor.  \nNote that, after defining the C FF please also check the \nload regulation, because feedforward capacitor might inject an offset voltage into V OUT to cause V OUT \ninaccuracy. If t he output voltage is over spec caused by \ncalculated C FF, please decrease the value of \nfeedforward capacitor C FF or place a series resistor of \nRT to FB pin.  \n \nFigure 5. Load Transient Respons e with and without \nFeedforward Capacitor  \nEnable Operation  \nThe RT6263A/B  is enabled when the VIN pin voltage \nrises above V UVLO  while the EN pin voltage exceeds \nVEN_H . The RT6263A/B  is disabled when the VIN pin \nvoltage falls below V UVLO  \uf02d \uf044VUVLO  or when the EN pin \nvoltage is below V EN_L. An internal pull -down resistor \nREN_DN , which is connected form EN to GND, ensures \nthat the chip still stays in shutdown even if EN pin is \nfloated.  \nFor automatic start -up, the EN pin, with high -voltage \nrating, can be connected to the input supply V IN directly \nas shown in Figure 6.  \nThe b uilt-in hysteresis band makes the EN pin useful \nfor simple delay and timing circuits. The EN pin can be \nexternally connected to V IN by adding a resistor R EN \nand a capacitor C EN, as shown in Figure 7, to have an \nadditional delay. The time delay can be calcu lated by \nthe equation below with the EN's internal threshold, at \nwhich switching operation begins.  \nEN\nthth\nth EN_HtC  = VR lnVV\uf0b4\uf02d\n \n\n   RT6263A/B  \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

Resistor Divider for Lockout Threshold \nSetting \nIf VIN shuts down faster than V OUT and V OUT is larger \nthan 3.7V, buck converter becomes boost converter \nand generates negative current. To prevent these \ncondition, EN should be shut down before V IN falls \nbelow V OUT. Therefore, the resistor divider for lockout \nthreshold is recommended.  \nBootstrap Dri ver Supply  \nThe bootstrap capacitor (C BOOT ) between the BOOT \npin and the SW pin is used to create a voltage rail \nabove the applied input voltage, VIN. Specifically, the \nbootstrap capacitor is charged through an internal \ndiode to a voltage equal to approximately PVCC each \ntime the low -side switch is turned on. The charge on \nthis capacitor is then used to supply the required \ncurrent during the remainder of the switching cycle. For \nmost applications , a 0.1\uf06dF, 0603 or 0402 ceramic \ncapacitor is recommend ed and the capacitor should \nhave a 6.3 V or higher voltage rating.  \nExternal Bootstrap Diode (Optional)  \nA bootstrap capacitor of 0.1 \uf06dF low -ESR ceramic  \ncapacitor is connected between the BOOT and SW \npins to supply the high -side gate driver. It is \nrecommende d to add an external bootstrap diode \nbetween an external 5V voltage supply and the BOOT \nRT6263A/B    \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

The bootstrap diode can be \na low -cost one, such as 1N4148 or BAT54. The \nexternal 5 V can be a fixed 5V voltage supply from the \nsystem, or a 5V output voltage generated by the \nRT6263A/B. Note that the BOOT voltage V BOOT  must \nbe lower than 5.5V.  \nSWBOOT5V\n0.1μFRT6263A/BDBOOT\nCBOOT\n \nFigure 1 0. External Bootstrap Diode  \nExternal Bootstrap Resistor ( Optional)  \nThe gate driver of an internal power MOSFET, utilized \nas a high -side switch, is optimized for turning on the \nswitch . The gate driver is not only fast enough for \nreducing switching power loss, but also slow enough \nfor minimizing EMI. The EMI issue is worse when the \nswitch is turned on rapidly due to the induced high di/dt \nnoises. When the high -side switch is turned off, the \ndischarging time  on SW node is relatively slow \nbecause there’s the presence of dead time, both \nhigh-side and low -side MOSFETs are turned off in this \ninterval.  In some cases, it is desirable to reduce EMI \nfurther, even at the expense of some additional power \ndissipation. T he turn -on rate of the high -side switch can \nbe slowed by placing a small bootstrap resistor R BOOT  \nbetween the BOOT pin and the external bootstrap \ncapacitor as shown in Figure 11. The recommended \nrange for the R BOOT  is several ohms to 47 ohms , and it \ncould be 0402 or 0603 in size.  \nThis will slow down the rates of the high -side switch \nturn on and the rise of V SW. In order to improve EMI \nperformance and enhancement of the internal \nMOSFET switch, the recommended application circuit \nis shown in Figure 12, which includes an external \nbootstrap diode for charging the bootstrap capacitor \nand a bootstrap resistor R BOOT  placed between the \nBOOT pin and the capacitor/diode connection.  \nSWBOOT\nCBOOTRT6263A/BRBOOT\n0.1μF \nFigure 11.

External Bootstrap Diode and Resistor at \nthe BOOT Pin  \nSoft-Start  \nThe RT6263A/B provides adjustable soft -start function. \nWhen the EN pin becomes logic-high, the SS charge \ncurrent (I SS) begins to charg e the capacitor which is \nconnected from the SS pin to GND (C SS).The soft -start \nfunction is used to prevent large inrush current while \nthe converter is in power -up stage The soft -start tim e \ncan be programmed by the external capacitor C SS \nbetween SS and GND. An internal current source I SS \n(6\uf06dA) charges  an external capacitor to build a soft -start \nramp voltage. The V FB voltage will track the internal \nramp voltage during soft -start interval. The typical \nsoft-start time is calculated as below  : \nSS SS SS FB SSt = C 0.7V/30 μA + C V  /I \uf0b4\uf0b4\n \n, where t SS = SS ris es to FB settled point (T2 + T3)  \n   RT6263A/B  \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

Operation of SS Pin when Starting  \nPower Good  \nThe PGOOD pin is an open -drain output for \npower -good indication  and should  be connected to an \nexternal voltage source through a pull -up resistor. The \nvoltage source can be an external voltage supply or the \noutput of the RT6263A/B , and it must be lower than \n5.5V to avoid the damage risk on this pin.  It is \nrecommended to connect a  100k\uf057 between the \nexternal voltage source  and PGOOD pin.  \nThe power -good function is activated after soft -start is \ncompleted  and controlled by the feedback signal V FB. \nDuring soft -start, this pin stays in logic -low, and it's only \nallowed to transfer to log ic-high as soft -start cycle is \ndone. After a certain delay time that V FB reaches the \npower -good high threshold (V TH_PGLH ) (typically 90% \nof the reference voltage), the PGOOD pin becomes \nhigh impedance to hold V PGOOD  logic high. On the \ncontrary , the PGOOD p in is forced to logic -low while \nVFB falls to the power -good low threshold (V TH_PGHL ) \n(typically 85% of the reference voltage). Furthermore, \nthis pin is also forced to logic -low as any internal \nprotection is triggered.  \nThermal Consideration  \nIn many applicat ions, the RT6263A/B does not \ngenerate much heat due to its high efficiency and low \nthermal resistance of its TSOT -23-8(FC) package. \nHowever, in applications in which the RT6263A/B run s at a high ambient temperature and high input voltage, \nthe generated hea t may exceed the maximum junction \ntemperature of the part.  \nThe 6263A/B includes an over -temperature protection \n(OTP) circuitry to prevent overheating due to excessive \npower dissipation.  If the junction temperature reaches \napproximately 155 °C, the RT6263A/B  stops switching \nthe power MOSFETs until the temperature is cooled \ndown by 35°C . \nNote that the over temperature protection is intended to \nprotect the device during momentary overload \nconditions. The protection is activated outside of the \nabsolute maximum r ange of operation as a secondary \nfail-safe and therefore should not be relied upon \noperationally. Continuous operation above the specified \nabsolute maximum operating junction temperature may \nimpair device reliability or permanently damage the \ndevice.  \nThe m aximum power dissipation can be calculated by \nthe following formula  : \n\uf028\uf029\uf028\uf029\uf028\uf029\uf028 \uf029 A D MAX J MAX JA EFFECTIVEP = T T  / θ  \uf02d\n \n, where T J(MAX)  is the maximum allowed junction \ntemperature of the die. For recommended operating \ncondition specifications, the maximum junction \ntemperature is  125°C. TA is the ambient operating \ntemperature, and θJA(EFFECTIVE)  is the system -level \njunction to ambient thermal resistance. It can be \nestimated from thermal modeling or measurements in \nthe system.  \nThe thermal resistance of the device strongly depends \non the surrounding PCB layout and can be improved by \nproviding a heat sink of surrounding copper ground. The \naddition of backside copper with thermal vias, stiffeners, \nand other enhancements can also help reduce thermal \nresistance.  \nAs an example, consider ing the case when the \nRT6263A is used in application where V IN = 12V, I OUT = \n3A, f SW = 650kHz, V OUT = 3.3V. The efficiency at 3.3V, \n3A is 85.9%  by using WE-74404054047  (4.7\uf06dH, 30m\uf057 \nDCR) as the inductor and measured at room \ntemperature. The core loss can be obtained from its \nwebsite and it’s 102mW . In this case, the power \ndissipation of the RT6263A is  \nRT6263A/B    \nCopyright ©  2021 Richtek Technology Corporation.

This practice is essential for high \nefficie ncy. \n\uf084 Place the input MLCC capacitors as close to the VIN \nand GND pins as possible.
