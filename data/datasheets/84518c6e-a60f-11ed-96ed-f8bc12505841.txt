This device supplies 500mA of output current with \na typical dropout voltage of 155mV. The L T3021 is ideal for low input voltage to low output voltage applications, providing comparable electrical efficiency to that of a switching regulator.\nThe L T3021 regulator optimizes stability and transient \nresponse with low ESR, ceramic output capacitors as small as 3.3µF . Other L T3021 features include 0.05% typical line regulation and 0.2% typical load regulation. In shutdown, quiescent current typically drops to 3µA. \nInternal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery pro -\ntection, current limiting, thermal limiting with hysteresis, \nand reverse-current protection. The L\nT3021 is available as \nan adjustable output device with an output range down to the 200mV reference. Three fixed output voltages, 1.2V, 1.5V and 1.8V, are also available.\nThe L T3021 regulator is available in the low profile \n(0.75mm) 16-pin (5mm × 5mm) DFN package with ex -\nposed pad and the 8\n-lead SO package.\n1.8V to 1.5V, 500mA VLDO Regulatorn VIN Range: 0.9V to 10V\nn Dropout V oltage: 155mV Typical\nn Output Current: 500mA\nn Adjustable Output (V REF = V OUT(MIN)  = 200mV)\nn Fixed Output V oltages: 1.2V , 1.5V , 1.8V\nn Stable with Low ESR, Ceramic Output Capacitors   \n(3.3µF Minimum)\nn 0.2% Load Regulation from 1mA to 500mA\nn Quiescent Current: 110µA (T yp)\nn 3µA T ypical Quiescent Current in Shutdown\nn Current Limit Protection\nn Reverse-Batter y Protection\nn No Reverse Current\nn Thermal Limiting with Hysteresis\nn 16-Pin DFN (5mm × 5mm) and 8-Lead  \nSO Packages\nn Low Current Regulators\nn Batter y-Powered Systems\nn Cellular Phones\nn Pagers\nn Wireless ModemsAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nMinimum Input Voltage\nIN\nSHDN SENSE3.3μF\n3021 TA01OUTVIN\n1.8V\nGNDLT3021-1.5VOUT\n1.5V\n500mA3.3μF\nTEMPERATURE (°C)–50MINIMUM INPUT VOLTAGE (V)1.1\n1.0\n0.90.8\n0.60.7\n0.5\n0.40.30.20.1\n0\n3021 TA0225 0 –25 50 75 125 100IL = 500mA\nDocument Feedback\nLT3021/LT3021-1.2/ \nLT3021-1.5/LT3021-1.8\n2\nRev.D For more information www.analog.comABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nIN Pin Voltage  ........................................................ ± 10V\nOUT Pin Voltage\n \n...................................................... ±10V\nInput-to-Output Differential Voltage\n \n........................ ±10V\nADJ/SENSE Pin Voltage \n \n.......................................  ±10V\nSHDN Pin Voltage \n \n.................................................  ±10V\nOutput Short-Circut Duration \n \n.........................

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: The L T3021 regulators are tested and specified under pulse load \nconditions such that T\nJ ≈ TA. The L T3021E regulators are 100% tested \nat TA = 25°C. Performance at –40°C and 125°C is assured by design, \ncharacterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The L T3021I regulators are guaranteed over the full –40ºC to 125ºC operating junction temperature range.\nNote 3: This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction temperature will exceed 125°C when overtemperature protection is active. Continuous operation above the specified maximum operating junction temperature may impair device reliability.\nNote 4: Maximum junction temperature limits operating conditions. The \nregulated output voltage specification does not apply for all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. Limit the output current range if operating at maximum input voltage. Limit the input voltage range if operating at maximum output current. \nNote 5: Typically the L T3021 supplies 500mA output current with a 1V \ninput supply. The guranteed minimum input voltage for 500mA output current is 1.10V .\nNote 6: The L T3021 is tested and specified for these conditions with an \nexternal resistor divider (20k and 30.1k) setting V\nOUT to 0.5V. The external \nresistor divider adds 10µA of output load current. The line regulation and load regulation specifications refer to the change in the 0.2V reference voltage, not the 0.5V output voltage. Specifications for fixed output voltage devices are referred to the output voltage.\nNote 7: Dropout voltage is the minimum input to output voltage differential \nneeded to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout the output voltage equals: (V\nIN – VDROPOUT ).\nNote 8: GND pin current is tested with V IN = VOUT(NOMINAL)  + 0.4V and a \ncurrent source load. GND pin current will increase in dropout. See GND pin current curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nNote 9: Adjust pin bias current flows out of the ADJ pin.Note 10: Shutdown pin current flows into the SHDN pin.Note 11: Reverse output current is tested with IN grounded and OUT \nforced to the rated output voltage. This current flows into the OUT pin and out of the GND pin. For fixed voltage devices this includes the current in the output resistor divider .\nNote 12: The L T3021 is tested and specified for these conditions with an \nexternal resistor divider (20k and 100k) setting V\nOUT to 1.2V. The external \nresistor divider adds 10µA of load current.\nNote 13: Reverse current is higher for the case of (rated_output) < V OUT \n< VIN, because the no-load recovery circuitry is active in this region and is \ntrying to restore the output voltage to its nominal value.Note 14: Minimum input voltage is the minimum voltage required by the \ncontrol circuit to regulate the output voltage and supply the full 500mA rated current. This specification is tested at V\nOUT = 0.5V. At higher output \nvoltages the minimum input voltage required for regulation will be equal to the regulated output voltage V\nOUT plus the dropout voltage.ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS The l denotes the

The pull-up resistor supplies the pull-up current to the open collector/  drain logic, normally several microamperes, and the SHDN  \npin current, typically 2.5µA.

The L\nT3021 withstands reverse voltages \non the IN pin with respect to ground and the OUT pin. In the case of a reversed input, which occurs if a battery is plugged in backwards, the L T3021 acts as if a diode is in series with its input.

Devices supply 500mA of output current and dropout voltage is typically 155mV. Quiescent current is typically 110µA and drops to 3µA in shutdown. The L T3021 incorporates several protection features, making it ideal for use in battery-powered sys -\ntems. The device protects itself against reverse-input and reverse-output voltages. In batter\ny backup applications \nwhere the output is held up by a backup battery when the input is pulled to ground, the L T3021 acts as if a diode is in series with its output which prevents reverse current flow. In dual supply applications where the regulator load is returned to a negative supply, the output can be pulled below ground by as much as 10V without affecting  \nstart-up or normal operation. \nAdjustable Operation\nThe \nL T3021’s output voltage range is 0.2V to 9.5V. Figure \n1 shows that the output voltage is set by the ratio of two \nexternal resistors. The device regulates the output to main -\ntain the ADJ pin voltage at 200mV referenced to ground. The current in R1 equals 200mV\n/R1 and the current in R2 \nis the current in R1 minus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current of 20nA flows out of the pin. Use the formula in Figure 1 to calculate output voltage. An R1 value of 20k sets the resistor divider current to 10µA. Note that in shutdown the output is turned off and the divider current is zero. Curves of ADJ Pin Voltage vs Temperature and ADJ Pin Bias Current vs Temperature appear in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nSpecifications for output voltages greater than 200mV \nare proportional to the ratio of desired output voltage to 200mV; (V\nOUT/200mV). For example, load regulation for \nan output current change of 1mA to 500mA is typically  0.4mV at V ADJ = 200mV . At V OUT = 1.5V , load regulation is:\n (1.5V\n/200mV) • (0.4mV) = 3mV\nOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe L T3021’s design is stable with a wide range of output \ncapacitors, but is optimized for low ESR ceramic capacitors. The output capacitor’s ESR affects stability, most notably with small value capacitors. Use a minimum output ca -\npacitor of 3.3µF with an ESR of 0.2Ω or less to prevent oscillations. The L\nT3021 is a low voltage device, and output \nload transient response is a function of output capacitance. Larger values of output capacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide improved transient response for larger load current changes. For output capacitor values greater than 22µF a small feedforward capacitor with a value of 300pF across the upper divider resistor (R2 in Figure 1) is required. Under extremely low output current conditions (I\nLOAD < 30µA) a low frequency small signal \noscillation (200Hz/8mV P-P at 1.2V output) can occur .  \nA minimum load of 100µA is recommended to prevent this instability\n.\nGive extra consideration to the use of ceramic capacitors. Manufacturers make ceramic capacitors with a variety of dielectrics, each with a different behavior across tempera -\nture and applied voltage. The most common dielectrics are Z5U, Y5V\n, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics \nprovide high C-V products in a small package at low cost, but exhibit strong voltage and temperature coefficients.  \nThe X5R and X7R dielectrics yield highly stable character -\nisitics and are more suitable for use as the output capacitor at fractionally increased cost. The X5R and X7R dielectrics both exhibit excellent voltage coefficient characteristics. The X7R type works over a larger temperature range and exhibits \nbetter temperature stability whereas X5R is less \nexpensive and is available in higher values. Figures 2 and 3 show voltage coefficient and temperature coefficient comparisons between Y5V and X5R material.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a piezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates voltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, similar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro -\nphone works. For a ceramic capacitor, the stress can be induced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients. The resulting voltages produced can cause appreciable\n Figure 1.

A ceramic capacitor produced Figure \n4’s trace in response to light tapping from a pencil. Similar vibration induced behavior can masquerade as increased output voltage noise.\nNo-Load/Light-Load Recovery\nA transient load step occurs when the output current changes \nfrom its maximum level to zero current or a very small load current. The output voltage responds by overshooting until the regulator lowers the amount of current it delivers to the new level. The regulator loop response time and the amount of output capacitance control the amount of overshoot. Once the regulator has decreased its output current, the current provided by the resistor divider (which sets V\nOUT) is the \nonly current remaining to discharge the output capacitor from the level to which it overshot. The amount of time it takes for the output voltage to recover easily extends to milliseconds with microamperes of divider current and a \nfew microfarads of output capacitance.To eliminate this problem, the L T3021 incorporates a  \nno-load or light-load recovery circuit. This circuit is a voltage-controlled current sink that significantly improves\n \nthe light load transient response time by discharging the output capacitor quickly and then turning off. The cur -\nrent sink turns on when the output voltage exceeds 6% of the nominal output voltage. The current sink level is then proportional to the overdrive above the threshold up \nto a maximum of approximately 15mA. Consult the \ncurve in the Typical Performance Characteristics for the No-Load Recovery Threshold.\nIf external circuitry forces the output above the no load recovery circuit’s threshold, the current sink turns on in an attempt to restore the output voltage to nominal. The current sink remains on until the external circuitry releases the output. However, if the external circuitry pulls the output voltage above the input voltage, or the input falls below the output, the L T3021 turns the current sink off and shuts down the bias current/reference generator circuitry.\nThermal Considerations\nThe L T3021’s power handling capability is limited by \nits maximum rated junction temperature of 125°C. The power dissipated by the device is comprised of two components:\n1. \n O\nutput current multiplied by the input-to-output voltage \ndifferential: (I OUT)(VIN – VOUT) and\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:\n \n(IGND)(VIN).\nGND pin current is found by examining the GND pin current \ncurves in the Typical Performance Characteristics. Power dissipation is equal to the sum of the two components listed above. Figure 2. Ceramic Capacitor DC Bias Characteristics\nFigure 3. Ceramic Capacitor Temperature CharacteristicsFigure 4.

For normal continuous conditions, do not ex -\nceed the maximum junction temperature rating of 125°C. Carefully consider all sour\nces of thermal resistance from \njunction to ambient including other heat sources mounted in proximity to the L T3021.\nThe underside of the L T3021 DH package has exposed \nmetal (14mm\n2) from the lead frame to where the die is \nattached. This allows heat to directly transfer from the die junction to the printed circuit board metal to control maximum operating junction temperature. The dual-in-line pin arrangement allows metal to extend beyond the ends of the package on the topside (component side) of a PCB. Connect this metal to GND on the PCB. The multiple IN and OUT pins of the L T3021 also assist in spreading heat to the PCB.\nThe L T3021 S8 package has Pin 4 fused with the lead \nframe. This also allows heat to transfer from the die to the printed circuit board metal, therefore reducing the thermal resistance. Copper board stiffeners and plated through-holes can also be used to spread the heat generated by power devices.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several \ndifferent board sizes and copper areas for two different packages.

So the junction temperature \nrise above ambient is approximately equal to:\n 0.41W(47.5°C/W) = 19.5°C\nThe maximum junction temperature equals the maximum junction temperature rise above ambient plus the maximum\n \nambient temperature or:\n \nTJMAX = 19.5°C + 70°C = 89.5°C\nProtection Features\nThe L T3021 incorporates several protection features \nthat make it ideal for use in battery-powered circuits.  \nIn addition to the normal protection features associated with monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and thermal limiting, the device also protects against reverse-input voltages, reverse-output voltages and reverse out -\nput-to-input voltages.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nprotect \nthe device against current overload conditions at \nthe output of the device. For normal operation, do not exceed a junction temperature of 125°C.\nThe IN pins of the device withstand reverse voltages of \n10V. The L T3021 limits current flow to less than 1µA and no negative voltage appears at OUT. The device protects both itself and the load against batteries that are plugged \nin backwards.\nLT3021/LT3021-1.2/ \nLT3021-1.5/LT3021-1.8\n14\nRev.D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe L T3021 incurs no damage if OUT is pulled below \nground. If IN is left open circuit or grounded, OUT can be pulled below ground by 10V. No current flows from the pass transistor connected to OUT. However, current flows in (but is limited by) the resistor divider that sets the out -\nput voltage. Current flows from the bottom resistor in the divider \nand from the ADJ pin’s internal clamp through the \ntop resistor in the divider to the external circuitry pulling OUT below ground. If IN is powered by a voltage source, OUT sources current equal to its current limit capability and the L T3021 protects itself by thermal limiting. In this case, grounding SHDN turns off the L T3021 and stops OUT from sourcing current.\nThe L T3021 incurs no damage if the ADJ pin is pulled \nabove or below ground by 10V. If IN is left open circuit or grounded and ADJ is pulled above ground, ADJ acts like a 25k resistor in series with a 1V clamp (one Schottky diode in series with one diode). ADJ acts like a 25k resistor in series with a Schottky diode if pulled below ground. If IN is powered by a voltage source and ADJ is pulled below its reference voltage, the L T3021 attempts to source its current limit capability at OUT. The output voltage increases to V\nIN \n– VDROPOUT  with V DROPOUT  set by whatever load current \nthe L T3021 supports. This condition can potentially dam -\nage external circuitry powered by the L T3021 if the output voltage increases to an unregulated high voltage. If IN is powered by a voltage sour\nce and ADJ is pulled above its \nreference voltage, two situations can occur. If ADJ is pulled slightly above its reference voltage, the L T3021 turns off the pass transistor , no output current is sourced and the output voltage decreases to either the voltage at ADJ or less. If ADJ is pulled above its no load recovery threshold, the no load recovery circuitry turns on and attempts to sink current. OUT is actively pulled low and the output voltage clamps at a Schottky diode above ground. Please note that the behavior described above applies to the L T3021 only. If a resistor divider is connected under the same conditions, there will be additional V/R current.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several \ndifferent input/output conditions can occur. The output voltage may be held up while the input is either pulled to ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage or is left open circuit. In the case where the input is grounded, there is less than 1µA of reverse output current.If the L T3021 IN pin is forced below the OUT pin or the OUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, input current drops to less than 10µA typically. This occurs if the L T3021 input is connected to a discharged (low voltage) battery and either a backup battery or a second regulator circuit holds up the output. The state of the SHDN pin has no effect on the \nreverse output current if OUT is pulled above IN.\nInput Capacitance and Stability\nThe L T3021 is designed to be stable with a minimum \ncapacitance of 3.3µF placed at the IN pin. Ceramic capaci -\ntors with very low ESR may be used. However, in cases where a long wire is used to connect a power supply to the input of the L\nT3021 (and also from the ground of the \nL T3021 back to the power supply ground), use of low value input capacitors combined with an output load current of 20mA or greater may result in an unstable application. This is due to the inductance of the wire forming an LC tank circuit with the input capacitor and not a result of the L T3021 being unstable.\nThe self-inductance, or isolated inductance, of a wire is \ndirectly proportional to its length. However, the diameter of a wire does not have a major influence on its self-in -\nductance. For example, the self inductance of a 2-AWG isolated \nwire with a diameter of 0.26 in. is about half the \ninductance of a 30-AWG wire with a diameter of 0.01 in. \nOne foot of 30-AWG wire has 465nH of self inductance.\nThe overall self-inductance of a wire can be reduced in \ntwo ways. One is to divide the current flowing towards the L T3021 between two parallel conductors and flows in the same direction in each. In this case, the farther the wires are placed apart from each other, the more inductance will be reduced, up to a 50% reduction when placed a few inches apart. Splitting the wires basically connects two equal inductors in parallel. However, when placed in close proximity from each other, mutual inductance is added to the overall self inductance of the wires. The most effective way to reduce overall inductance is to place the forward and return-current conductors (the wire for the input and the wire for ground) in very close proximity. T wo 30-AWG wires separated by 0.02 in. reduce the overall self-induc -\ntance to about one-fifth of a single isolated wire.\nLT3021/LT3021-1.2/ \nLT3021-1.5/LT3021-1.8\n15\nRev.D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIf the L T3021 is powered by a battery mounted in close \nproximity on the same circuit board, a 3.3µF input capacitor is sufficient for stability. However, if the L T3021 is powered by a distant supply, use a larger value input capacitor fol -\nlowing the guideline of roughly 1µF (in addition to the 3.3µF minimum) per 8 inches of wire length. As power supply output impedance may var\ny, the minimum input capaci -\ntance needed to stabilize the application may also vary.  Extra capacitance may also be placed directly on the output of the power supply; however\n, this will require an order of \nmagnitude more capacitance as opposed to placing extra capacitance in close proximity to the L T3021. Furthermore, series resistance may be placed between the supply and the input of the L T3021 to stabilize the application; as little as 0.1Ω to 0.5Ω will suffice.\nPACKAGE DESCRIPTION\nDH Package\n16-Lead Plastic DFN (5mm × 5mm)\n(Reference L TC DWG # 05-08-1709)\n5.00 ±0.105.00 ±0.10\nNOTE:\n1.
