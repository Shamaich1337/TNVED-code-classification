A For more information www.analog.com Document FeedbackTYPICAL APPLICATION FEATURES DESCRIPTION42V, 6A Synchronous  \nStep-Down Regulator with \nCurrent Sense and 3µA \nQuiescent Current\nThe LT®8613 is a compact, high efficiency, high speed \nsynchronous monolithic step-down switching regulator \nthat consumes only 3µA of quiescent current. Top and \nbottom power switches are included with all necessary \ncircuitry to minimize the need for external components. \nThe built-in current sense amplifier with monitor and con -\ntrol pins allows accurate input or output current regulation \nand limiting. Low ripple Burst Mode operation enables \nhigh efficiency down to very low output currents while \nkeeping the output ripple below 10mV P-P. A SYNC pin \nallows synchronization to an external clock. Internal com -\npensation with peak current mode topology allows the use \nof small inductors and results in fast transient response \nand good loop stability. The EN/UV pin has an accurate \n1V threshold and can be used to program V IN undervolt -\nage lockout or to shut down the LT8613 reducing the \ninput supply current to 1µA. A capacitor on the TR/SS pin \nprograms the output voltage ramp rate during start-up. \nThe PG flag signals when V OUT is within ±9% of the pro -\ngrammed output voltage as well as fault conditions. The \nLT8613 is available in a small 28-lead 3mm × 6mm QFN \npackage with exposed pad for low thermal resistance.\n5V Step-Down Converter with 6A Output Current LimitEfficiency at 5V OUTAPPLICATIONS nRail-to-Rail Current Sense Amplifier with Monitor\n nWide Input Voltage Range: 3.4V to 42V\n nUltralow Quiescent Current Burst Mode® Operation:\n n3μA I Q Regulating 12V IN to 3.3V OUT\n nOutput Ripple < 10mV P-P \n nHigh Efficiency Synchronous Operation:\n n95% Efficiency at 3A, 5V OUT from 12V IN \n n94% Efficiency at 3A, 3.3V OUT from 12V IN \n nFast Minimum Switch-On Time: 40ns\n nLow Dropout Under All Conditions: 250mV at 3A\n nAllows Use of Small Inductors\n nLow EMI\n nAdjustable and Synchronizable: 200kHz to 2.2MHz\n nCurrent Mode Operation\n nAccurate 1V Enable Pin Threshold\n nInternal Compensation\n nOutput Soft-Start and T racking\n nSmall Thermally Enhanced 3mm × 6mm 28-Lead  \nQFN Package\n nAutomotive and Industrial Supplies\n nGeneral Purpose Step-Down\n nCCCV Power Supplies\nBST VIN\nEN/UV ON  OFF\nSYNC\nIMON\nICTRL\nINTV CC\nTR/SS\nRTSWL T8613\nGND PGNDISP\nBIASISN\nPG\n8613 TA01aFB0.1µF\nVOUT\n5V\n6A 1µF\n100µF10µFVIN\n5.8V TO 42V\n10µF\n1µF10pF3.9µH 8m/uni03A9\n1M\n243k 60.4k\nfSW = 700kHz\nL: EPCOS B82559LOAD CURRENT (A)0EFFICIENCY (%)\n657075100\n85\n2 4 5 6\n8613 TA01b609095\n80\n1 3fSW = 700kHz\nL = 3.9µHVIN = 24VVIN = 12VAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. \nLT8613\n2\nRev.

A For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS\nSYNC (Pin 1):  External Clock Synchronization Input. \nGround this pin for low ripple Burst Mode operation at \nlow output loads. Tie to a clock source for synchroniza -\ntion to an external frequency. Apply a DC voltage of 3V or \nhigher or tie to INTV CC for pulse-skipping mode. When \nin pulse-skipping mode, the I Q will increase to several \nhundred µA. When SYNC is DC high or synchronized, \nfrequency foldback will be disabled. Do not float this pin.\nTR/SS (Pin 2):  Output T racking and Soft-Start Pin. This \npin allows user control of output voltage ramp rate during \nstart-up. A TR/SS voltage below 0.97V forces the LT8613  \nto regulate the FB pin to equal the TR/SS pin voltage. When \nTR/SS is above 0.97V, the tracking function is disabled and \nthe internal reference resumes control of the error ampli -\nfier . An internal 2.2μA pull-up current from INTV CC on this \npin allows a capacitor to program output voltage slew rate. \nThis pin is pulled to ground with an internal 230Ω MOSFET \nduring shutdown and fault conditions;  use a series resistor \nif driving from a low impedance output. This pin may be \nleft floating if the tracking function is not needed.\nRT (Pin 3): A resistor is tied between RT and ground to \nset the switching frequency.\nEN/UV (Pin 4): The LT8613 is shut down when this pin \nis low and active when this pin is high. The hysteretic \nthreshold voltage is 1.00V going up and 0.96V going \ndown. Tie to V IN if the shutdown feature is not used. An \nexternal resistor divider from V IN can be used to program \na VIN threshold below which the LT8613 will shut down.\nVIN (Pins 5, 6, 7):  The V IN pins supply current to the \nLT8613 internal circuitry and to the internal topside power \nswitch. These pins must be tied together and be locally \nbypassed. Be sure to place the positive terminal of the \ninput capacitor as close as possible to the V IN pins, and \nthe negative capacitor terminal as close as possible to \nthe PGND pins.\nPGND (Pins 8, 9, 10): Power Switch Ground. These pins \nare the return path of the internal bottom-side power \nswitch and must be tied together . Place the negative ter -\nminal of the input capacitor as close to the PGND pins \nas possible. GND (Pins 11, 12, 13, 14):  It is recommended that \nthese be connected to GND so that the exposed pad \nGND can be run to the top level GND copper to enhance \nthermal\xa0performance.\nSW (Pins 15 –19): The SW pins are the outputs of the \ninternal power switches. Tie these pins together and con -\nnect them to the inductor and boost capacitor .

A For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nThe LT8613 is a monolithic, constant frequency, current \nmode step-down DC/DC converter . An oscillator , with \nfrequency set using a resistor on the RT pin, turns on \nthe internal top power switch at the beginning of each \nclock cycle. Current in the inductor then increases until \nthe top switch current comparator trips and turns off the \ntop power switch. The peak inductor current at which \nthe top switch turns off is controlled by the voltage on \nthe internal VC node. The error amplifier servos the VC \nnode by comparing the voltage on the V FB pin with an \ninternal 0.97V reference. When the load current increases \nit causes a reduction in the feedback voltage relative to \nthe reference leading the error amplifier to raise the VC \nvoltage until the average inductor current matches the \nnew load current.  When the top power switch turns off, \nthe synchronous power switch turns on until the next \nclock cycle begins or inductor current falls to zero. If over -\nload conditions result in more than 10A flowing through \nthe bottom switch (valley current), the next clock cycle \nwill be delayed until switch current returns to a safe level.\nThe LT8613 includes a current control and monitoring \nloop using the ISN, ISP , IMON and ICTRL pins. The ISP/\nISN pins monitor the voltage across an external sense \nresistor such that the V ISP-VISN does not exceed 50mV \nby limiting the peak inductor current controlled by the \nVC node. The current sense amplifier inputs (ISP/ISN) \nare rail-to-rail such that input, output, or other system \ncurrents may be monitored and regulated. The IMON pin \noutputs a ground-referenced voltage equal to 20 times \nthe voltage between the ISP-ISN pins for monitoring sys -\ntem currents. The ICTRL pin can be used to override the \ninternal 50mV limit between the ISP , ISN pin to a lower \nset point for the current control loop. \nIf the EN/UV pin is low, the LT8613 is shut down and \ndraws 1µA from the input. When the EN/UV pin is above \n1V, the switching regulator will become active.To optimize efficiency at light loads, the LT8613 operates \nin Burst Mode operation in light load situations. Between \nbursts, all circuitry associated with controlling the output \nswitch is shut down, reducing the input supply current to \n1.7μA. In a typical application, 3μA will be consumed from \nthe input supply when regulating with no load. The SYNC \npin is tied low to use Burst Mode operation and can be \ntied to a logic high to use pulse-skipping mode. If a clock \nis applied to the SYNC pin the part will synchronize to an \nexternal clock frequency and operate in pulse-skipping \nmode. While in pulse-skipping mode the oscillator oper -\nates continuously and positive SW transitions are aligned \nto the clock. During light loads, switch pulses are skipped \nto regulate the output and the quiescent current will be \nseveral hundred µA.\nTo improve efficiency across all loads, supply current to \ninternal circuitry can be sourced from the BIAS pin when \nbiased at 3.3V or above. Else, the internal circuitry will draw \ncurrent from V IN. The BIAS pin should be connected to \nVOUT if the LT8613 output is programmed at 3.3V or above.\nComparators monitoring the FB pin voltage will pull the PG \npin low if the output voltage varies more than ±9% (typ -\nical) from the set point, or if a fault condition is present.\nThe oscillator reduces the LT8613’s operating frequency \nwhen the voltage at the FB pin is low. This frequency \nfoldback helps to control the inductor current when the \noutput voltage is lower than the programmed value which \noccurs during start-up or overcurrent conditions. When \na clock is applied to the SYNC pin or the SYNC pin is \nheld DC high, the frequency foldback is disabled and the \nswitching frequency will slow down only during overcur -\nrent conditions.\nLT8613\n12\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nAchieving Ultralow Quiescent Current\nTo enhance efficiency at light loads, the LT8613 oper -\nates in low ripple Burst Mode operation, which keeps the \noutput capacitor charged to the desired output voltage \nwhile minimizing the input quiescent current and mini -\nmizing output voltage ripple. In Burst Mode operation the \nLT8613 delivers single small pulses of current to the out -\nput capacitor followed by sleep periods where the output \npower is supplied by the output capacitor . While in sleep \nmode the LT8613 consumes 1.7μA.\nAs the output load decreases, the frequency of single cur -\nrent pulses decreases (see Figure\xa0 1a) and the percentage \nof time the LT8613 is in sleep mode increases, resulting in much higher light load efficiency than for typical convert -\ners. By maximizing the time between pulses, the converter \nquiescent current approaches 2.5µA for a typical applica -\ntion when there is no output load. Therefore, to optimize \nthe quiescent current performance at light loads, the cur -\nrent in the feedback resistor divider must be minimized \nas it appears to the output as load current. \nWhile in Burst Mode operation the current limit of the top \nswitch is approximately 1A resulting in output voltage \nripple shown in Figure\xa02. Increasing the output capac -\nitance will decrease the output ripple proportionally. As \nload ramps upward from zero the switching frequency \nwill increase but only up to the switching frequency \nprogrammed by the resistor at the RT pin as shown in \nFigure\xa0 1a. The output load at which the LT8613 reaches \nthe programmed frequency varies based on input voltage, \noutput voltage, and inductor choice.\nFor some applications it is desirable for the LT8613 to \noperate in pulse-skipping mode, offering two major differ -\nences from Burst Mode operation. First is the clock stays \nawake at all times and all switching cycles are aligned to \nthe clock. In this mode much of the internal circuitry is \nawake at all times, increasing quiescent current to several \nhundred µA. Second is that full switching frequency is \nreached at lower output load than in Burst Mode operation \n(see Figure\xa0 1b). To enable pulse-skipping mode, the SYNC \npin is tied high either to a logic output or to the INTV CC \npin. When a clock is applied to the SYNC pin the LT8613 \nwill also operate in pulse-skipping mode.\nFigure\xa01.

For a 3.3V application with R1 = 1M and \nR2 = 412k, the feedback divider draws 2.3µA. With V IN = \n12V and n = 80%, this adds 0.8µA to the 1.7µA quiescent \ncurrent resulting in 2.5µA no-load current from the 12V \nsupply. Note that this equation implies that the no-load \ncurrent is a function of V IN; this is plotted in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics section. \nWhen using large FB resistors, a 4.7pF to 10pF phase-lead \ncapacitor should be connected from V OUT to FB. \nSetting the Switching Frequency\nThe LT8613 uses a constant frequency PWM architecture \nthat can be programmed to switch from 200kHz to 2.2MHz  \nby using a resistor tied from the RT pin to ground. A table \nshowing the necessary R T value for a desired switching \nfrequency is in Table\xa01.\nThe R T resistor required for a desired switching frequency \ncan be calculated using:\n RT=46.5\nfSW–5.2\n (3)where R T is in kΩ and f SW is the desired switching fre -\nquency in MHz.\nTable\xa01.

The \nadvantage of high frequency operation is that smaller \ninductor and capacitor values may be used. The disadvan -\ntages are lower efficiency and a smaller input voltage range. \nThe highest switching frequency (f SW(MAX) ) for a given \napplication can be calculated as follows:\n fSW(MAX)=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\ntON(MIN)VIN–VSW(TOP)+VSW(BOT) ( ) (4)\nwhere V IN is the typical input voltage, V OUT is the output \nvoltage, V SW(TOP)  and V SW(BOT)  are the internal switch \ndrops (~ 0.4V, ~0.18V, respectively at maximum load) \nand t ON(MIN)  is the minimum top switch on-time (see the \nElectrical Characteristics). This equation shows that a \nslower switching frequency is necessary to accommodate \na high V IN/VOUT ratio. \nFor transient operation, V IN may go as high as the abso -\nlute maximum rating of 42V regardless of the R T value, \nhowever the LT8613 will reduce switching frequency \nas necessary to maintain control of inductor current to \nassure safe operation. \nLT8613\n14\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe LT8613 is capable of a maximum duty cycle of greater \nthan 99%, and the V IN-to-V OUT dropout is limited by the \nRDS(ON)  of the top switch. In this mode the LT8613 skips \nswitch cycles, resulting in a lower switching frequency \nthan programmed by RT .\nFor applications that cannot allow deviation from the pro -\ngrammed switching frequency at low V IN/VOUT ratios use \nthe following formula to set switching frequency: \nVIN(MIN)=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\n1–fSW•tOFF(MIN)–VSW(BOT)+VSW(TOP) (5)\nwhere V IN(MIN)  is the minimum input voltage without \nskipped cycles, V OUT is the output voltage, V SW(TOP)  and \nVSW(BOT)  are the internal switch drops (~ 0.4V, ~0.18V, \nrespectively at maximum load), f SW is the switching \nfrequency (set by RT), and t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum \nswitch off-time. Note that higher switching frequency will \nincrease the minimum input voltage below which cycles \nwill be dropped to achieve higher duty cycle.\nInductor Selection and Maximum Output Current\nThe LT8613 is designed to minimize solution size by \nallowing the inductor to be chosen based on the output \nload requirements of the application. During overload or \nshort-circuit conditions the LT8613 safely tolerates oper -\nation with a saturated inductor through the use of a high \nspeed peak-current mode architecture.\nA good first choice for the inductor value is:\n L=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\nfSW  (6)\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency in MHz, V OUT is \nthe output voltage, V SW(BOT)  is the bottom switch drop \n(~0.18V) and L is the inductor value in μH. \nTo avoid overheating and poor efficiency, an inductor must \nbe chosen with an RMS current rating that is greater than \nthe maximum expected output load of the application. \nIn addition, the saturation current (typically labeled I SAT)  \nrating of the inductor must be higher than the load current \nplus 1/2 of in inductor ripple current: \n IL(PEAK)=ILOAD(MAX)+1\n2ΔIL (7)where ∆IL is the inductor ripple current as calculated in \nEquation 9 and I LOAD(MAX)  is the maximum output load \nfor a given application. \nAs a quick example, an application requiring 4A output \nshould use an inductor with an RMS rating of greater than \n4A and an I SAT of greater than 5A. During long duration \noverload or short-circuit conditions, the inductor RMS is \ngreater to avoid overheating of the inductor . To keep the \nefficiency high, the series resistance (DCR) should be less \nthan 0.020Ω, and the core material should be intended \nfor high frequency applications. \nThe LT8613 limits the peak switch current in order to pro -\ntect the switches and the system from overload faults. The \ntop switch current limit (I LIM) is at least 7.5A at low duty \ncycles and decreases linearly to 6A at DC =  0.8. The induc -\ntor value must then be sufficient to supply the desired \nmaximum output current (I OUT(MAX) ), which is a function \nof the switch current limit (I LIM) and the ripple current.\n IOUT(MAX)=ILIM–ΔIL\n2 (8)\nThe peak-to-peak ripple current in the inductor can be \ncalculated as follows:\n ΔIL=VOUT\nL•fSW•1–VOUT\nVIN(MAX)⎛\n⎝⎜⎜⎞\n⎠⎟⎟\n (9)\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency of the LT8613, and \nL is the value of the inductor . Therefore, the maximum \noutput current that the LT8613 will deliver depends on \nthe switch current limit, the inductor value, and the input \nand output voltages. The inductor value may have to be \nincreased if the inductor ripple current does not allow \nsufficient maximum output current (I OUT(MAX) ) given the \nswitching frequency, and maximum input voltage used in \nthe desired application.\nThe optimum inductor for a given application may differ \nfrom the one indicated by this design guide. A larger value \ninductor provides a higher maximum load current and \nreduces the output voltage ripple. For applications requir -\ning smaller load currents, the value of the inductor may \nbe lower and the LT8613 may operate with higher ripple \nLT8613\n15\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\ncurrent. This allows use of a physically smaller inductor , \nor one with a lower DCR resulting in higher efficiency. \nBe aware that low inductance may result in discontin -\nuous mode operation, which further reduces maximum \nload\xa0current.\nFor more information about maximum output current and \ndiscontinuous operation, see Analog Devices Application \nNote 44. \nFinally, for duty cycles greater than 50% (V OUT/VIN > 0.5), \na minimum inductance is required to avoid sub-harmonic \noscillation. See Application Note 19. \nInput Capacitor\nBypass the input of the LT8613 circuit with a ceramic \ncapacitor of X7R or X5R type placed as close as pos -\nsible to the V IN and PGND pins. Y5V types have poor \nperformance over temperature and applied voltage, and \nshould not be used. A 10μF ceramic capacitor is adequate \nto bypass the LT8613 and will easily handle the ripple \ncurrent. Note that larger input capacitance is required \nwhen a lower switching frequency is used. If the input \npower source has high impedance, or there is significant \ninductance due to long wires or cables, additional bulk \ncapacitance may be necessary. This can be provided with \na low performance electrolytic capacitor .\nStep-down regulators draw current from the input sup -\nply in pulses with very fast rise and fall times. The input \ncapacitor is required to reduce the resulting voltage rip -\nple at the LT8613 and to force this very high frequency \nswitching current into a tight local loop, minimizing EMI. \nA 10μF capacitor is capable of this task, but only if it is \nplaced close to the LT8613 (see the PCB Layout section). \nA second precaution regarding the ceramic input capac -\nitor concerns the maximum input voltage rating of the LT8613. A ceramic input capacitor combined with trace \nor cable inductance forms a high quality (under damped) \ntank circuit. If the LT8613 circuit is plugged into a live \nsupply, the input voltage can ring to twice its nominal \nvalue, possibly exceeding the LT8613 ’s voltage rating. \nThis situation is easily avoided (see Analog Devices \nApplication Note 88).\nOutput Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor has two essential functions. Along \nwith the inductor , it filters the square wave generated \nby the LT8613 to produce the DC output. In this role it \ndetermines the output ripple, thus low impedance at the \nswitching frequency is important. The second function is \nto store energy in order to satisfy transient loads and sta -\nbilize the LT8613’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors have \nvery low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and provide \nthe best ripple performance. For good starting values, see \nthe Typical Application section.\nUse X5R or X7R types. This choice will provide low out -\nput ripple and good transient response. T ransient perfor -\nmance can be improved with a higher value output capac -\nitor and the addition of a feedforward capacitor placed \nbetween V OUT and FB. Increasing the output capacitance \nwill also decrease the output voltage ripple. A lower value \nof output capacitor can be used to save space and cost \nbut transient performance will suffer and may cause loop \ninstability. See the Typical Applications in this data sheet \nfor suggested capacitor values.\nWhen choosing a capacitor , special attention should be \ngiven to the data sheet to calculate the effective capaci -\ntance under the relevant operating conditions of voltage \nbias and temperature. A physically larger capacitor or one \nwith a higher voltage rating may be required. \nLT8613\n16\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nEnable Pin\nThe LT8613 is in shutdown when the EN pin is low and \nactive when the pin is high. The rising threshold of the EN \ncomparator is 1.0V, with 40mV of hysteresis. The EN pin \ncan be tied to V IN if the shutdown feature is not used, or \ntied to a logic level if shutdown control is required.\nAdding a resistor divider from V IN to EN programs the \nLT8613 to regulate the output only when V IN is above a \ndesired voltage (see the Block Diagram). Typically, this \nthreshold, V IN(EN) , is used in situations where the input \nsupply is current limited, or has a relatively high source \nresistance. A switching regulator draws constant power \nfrom the source, so source current increases as source \nvoltage drops. This looks like a negative resistance load \nto the source and can cause the source to current limit or \nlatch low under low source voltage conditions. The V IN(EN)  \nthreshold prevents the regulator from operating at source \nvoltages where the problems might occur . This threshold \ncan be adjusted by setting the values R3 and R4 such that \nthey satisfy the following equation:\n VIN(EN)=R3\nR4+1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•1.0V\n (10)\nwhere the LT8613 will remain off until V IN is above V IN(EN) . \nDue to the comparator’ s hysteresis, switching will not \nstop until the input falls slightly below V IN(EN) .\nWhen operating in Burst Mode operation for light load \ncurrents, the current through the V IN(EN)  resistor network \ncan easily be greater than the supply current consumed \nby the LT8613. Therefore, the V IN(EN)  resistors should be \nlarge to minimize their effect on efficiency at low loads.\nCurrent Control Loop\nIn addition to regulating the output voltage the LT8613 \nincludes a current regulation loop for setting the aver -\nage input or output current limit as shown in the Typical \nApplications section.\nThe LT8613 measures voltage drop across an external \ncurrent sense resistor using the ISP and ISN pins. This \nresistor may be connected between the inductor and the output capacitor to sense the output current or may be \nplaced between the V IN bypass capacitor and the input \npower source to sense input current. The current loop \nmodulates the internal cycle-by-cycle switch current limit \nsuch that the average voltage across ISP-ISN pins does \nnot exceed 50mV. \nCare must be taken and filters should be used to assure \nthe signal applied to the ISN and ISP pins has a peak-to-\npeak ripple of less than 30mV for accurate operation. In \naddition to high crest factor current waveforms such as \nthe input current of DC/DC regulators, another cause of \nhigh ripple voltage across the sense resistor is excessive \nresistor ESL. Typically the problem is solved by using a \nsmall ceramic capacitor across the sense resistor or using \na filter network between the ISP and ISN pins.\nThe ICTRL pin allows the ISP-ISN set point to be lin -\nearly controlled from 50mV to 0mV as the ICTRL pin is \nramped from 1V down to 0V, respectively and as shown \nin Figure\xa03. When this functionality is unused the ICTRL \npin may be tied to INTV CC or floated. In addition the ICTRL \npin includes a 2µA pull-up source such that a capacitor \nmay be added for soft-start functionality. \nThe IMON pin is a voltage output proportional to the \nvoltage across the current sense resistor such that V IMON \n= 20 • (ISP-ISN) as shown in Figure\xa04. This output can be \nused to monitor the input or output current of the LT8613  \nor may be an input to an ADC for further processing.\nFigure\xa03.

During the soft-\nstart ramp the output voltage will proportionally track the \nTR/SS pin voltage. For output tracking applications, TR/SS \ncan be externally driven by another voltage source. From \n0V to 0.97V, the TR/SS voltage will override the internal \n0.97V reference input to the error amplifier , thus regulating \nthe FB pin voltage to that of TR/SS pin. When TR/SS is \nabove 0.97V, tracking is disabled and the feedback voltage \nwill regulate to the internal reference voltage. The TR/SS \npin may be left floating if the function is not needed.\nAn active pull-down circuit is connected to the TR/SS pin \nwhich will discharge the external soft-start capacitor in \nthe case of fault conditions and restart the ramp when the \nfaults are cleared.

A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa05. Reverse V IN ProtectionThe LT8613 will not enter Burst Mode operation at low \noutput loads while synchronized to an external clock, but \ninstead will pulse skip to maintain regulation. The LT8613  \nmay be synchronized over a 200kHz to 2.2MHz range. The \nRT resistor should be chosen to set the LT8613 switch -\ning frequency equal to or below the lowest synchroni -\nzation input. For example, if the synchronization signal \nwill be 500kHz and higher , the R T should be selected for \n500kHz. The slope compensation is set by the R T value, \nwhile the minimum slope compensation required to avoid \nsubharmonic oscillations is established by the inductor \nsize, input voltage, and output voltage. Since the syn -\nchronization frequency will not change the slopes of the \ninductor current waveform, if the inductor is large enough \nto avoid subharmonic oscillations at the frequency set by \nRT, then the slope compensation will be sufficient for all \nsynchronization frequencies. \nFor some applications it is desirable for the LT8613 to \noperate in pulse-skipping mode, offering two major differ -\nences from Burst Mode operation. First is the clock stays \nawake at all times and all switching cycles are aligned \nto the clock. Second is that full switching frequency is \nreached at lower output load than in Burst Mode oper -\nation. These two differences come at the expense of \nincreased quiescent current. To enable pulse-skipping \nmode, the SYNC pin is tied high either to a logic output \nor to the INTVCC pin. \nThe LT8613 does not operate in forced continuous mode \nregardless of SYNC signal. Never leave the SYNC pin \nfloating.\nShorted and Reversed Input Protection\nThe LT8613 will tolerate a shorted output. Several features \nare used for protection during output short-circuit and \nbrownout conditions. The first is the switching frequency \nwill be folded back while the output is lower than the set \npoint to maintain inductor current control. Second, the \nbottom switch current is monitored such that if inductor \ncurrent is beyond safe levels switching of the top switch \nwill be delayed until such time as the inductor current \nfalls to safe levels.  Frequency foldback behavior depends on the state of \nthe SYNC pin: If the SYNC pin is low the switching fre -\nquency will slow while the output voltage is lower than \nthe programmed level. If the SYNC pin is connected to \na clock source or tied high, the LT8613 will stay at the \nprogrammed frequency without foldback and only slow \nswitching if the inductor current exceeds safe levels.\nThere is another situation to consider in systems where \nthe output will be held high when the input to the LT8613 is \nabsent. This may occur in battery charging applications or \nin battery-backup systems where a battery or some other \nsupply is diode ORed with the LT8613’s output. If the V IN \npin is allowed to float and the EN pin is held high (either \nby a logic signal or because it is tied to V IN), then the \nLT8613’s internal circuitry will pull its quiescent current \nthrough its SW pin. This is acceptable if the system can \ntolerate several μA in this state. If the EN pin is grounded \nthe SW pin current will drop to near 1µA . However , if \nthe V IN pin is grounded while the output is held high, \nregardless of EN, parasitic body diodes inside the LT8613  \ncan pull current from the output through the SW pin and \nthe V IN pin. Figure\xa05 shows a connection of the V IN and  \nEN/UV pins that will allow the LT8613 to run only when \nthe input voltage is present and that protects against a \nshorted or reversed input.\nVIN VIND1\nL T8613\nEN/UV\n8613 F05GND\nLT8613\n19\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa06. Recommended PCB Layout for the LT8613PCB Layout\nFor proper operation and minimum EMI, care must be taken \nduring printed circuit board layout. Figure 6  shows the rec -\nommended component placement with trace, ground plane \nand via locations. Note that large, switched currents flow in \nthe LT8613’ s VIN pins, PGND pins, and the input capacitor \n(C1). The loop formed by the input capacitor should be as \nsmall as possible by placing the capacitor adjacent to the \nVIN and PGND pins. When using a physically large input \ncapacitor the resulting loop may become too large in which \ncase using a small case/value capacitor placed close to the \nVIN and PGND pins plus a larger capacitor further away is \npreferred. These components, along with the inductor and \noutput capacitor , should be placed on the same side of the \ncircuit board, and their connections should be made on \nthat layer . Place a local, unbroken ground plane under the \napplication circuit on the layer closest to the surface layer . \nThe SW and BOOST nodes should be as small as possible. \nFinally, keep the FB and RT nodes small so that the ground \ntraces will shield them from the SW and BOOST nodes. \nThe exposed pad on the bottom of the package must be \nsoldered to ground so that the pad is connected to ground \nelectrically and also acts as a heat sink thermally. To keep \nthermal resistance low, extend the ground plane as much as \npossible, and add thermal vias under and near the LT8613  \nto additional ground planes within the circuit board and on \nthe bottom side. \nHigh Temperature Considerations\nFor higher ambient temperatures, care should be taken in \nthe layout of the PCB to ensure good heat sinking of the \nLT8613. The exposed pad on the bottom of the package \nmust be soldered to a ground plane. This ground should be \ntied to large copper layers below with thermal vias;  these \nlayers will spread heat dissipated by the LT8613. Placing \nadditional vias can reduce thermal resistance further . The \nmaximum load current should be derated as the ambient temperature approaches the maximum junction rating. \nPower dissipation within the LT8613 can be estimated by \ncalculating the total power loss from an efficiency mea -\nsurement and subtracting the inductor loss. The die tem -\nperature is calculated by multiplying the LT8613 power \ndissipation by the thermal resistance from junction to \nambient. The LT8613 will stop switching and indicate a \nfault condition if safe junction temperature is exceeded.
