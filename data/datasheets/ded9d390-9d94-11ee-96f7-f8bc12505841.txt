OPERATION \nPWM Operation \nThe MP8759 is a fully integrated, synchronous, \nrectified, step-down, switch-mode converter. Constant-on-time (COT) control is employed to \nprovide a fast transient response and ease loop \nstabilization. At the beginning of each cycle, the high-side MOSFET (HS-FET) is turned on when the feedback voltage (V\nFB) falls below the \nreference voltage (V REF), which indicates an \ninsufficient output voltage. The on period is \ndetermined by the output voltage and input voltage to make the switching frequency fairly constant over the input voltage range.  \nAfter the on period elapses, the HS-FET is turned \noff or enters an off state. It is turned on again \nwhen V\nFB drops below V REF. By repeating this \noperation, the converter regulates the output voltage. The integrated low-side MOSFET (LS-FET) is turned on when the HS-FET is in its off state to minimize conduction loss. There is a \ndead short between the input and GND if both \nthe HS-FET and LS-FET are turned on at the same time. This is called a shoot-through. To avoid a shoot-through, a dead time (DT) is generated internally between HS-FET off and LS-FET on, or LS-FET off and HS-FET on.  \nInternal compensation is applied for COT control \nto provide a more stable operation, even when ceramic capacitors are used as output capacitors. This internal compensation improves the jitter performance without affecting line or load \nregulation.  \nHeavy-Load Operation \nContinuous conduction mode (CCM) occurs \nwhen the output current is high and the inductor current is always above zero amps (see Figure 2). When V\nFB is below V REF, the HS-FET is turned on \nfor a fixed interval. When the HS-FET is turned \noff, the LS-FET is turned on until the next period.  \n \nFigure 2: Heavy-Load Operation In CCM operation, the switching frequency is in \npulse-width modulation (PWM) mode and is fairly \nconstant.  \nLight-Load Power Save Mode \nThe inductor current decreases as the load \ndecreases. If MODE is floating or pulled to ground, once the inductor current reaches zero, the operation switches from continuous conduction mode (CCM) to discontinuous conduction mode (DCM).  \nThe power save mode operation is shown in \nFigure 3. When V\nFB is below V REF, the HS-FET is \nturned on for a fixed interval, which is determined by a one-shot on-timer, as shown in Equation 1. When the HS-FET is turned off, the LS-FET is turned on until the inductor current reaches zero. In DCM operation, V\nFB does not reach V REF while \nthe inductor current is approaching zero. The LS-\nFET driver switches to tri-state (high-Z) whenever the inductor current reaches zero. As a result, the efficiency at light load is greatly improved. In light-load condition, the HS-FET is not turned on \nas frequently as in heavy-load condition. This is \ncalled skip mode. \nAt light-load or no-load condition, the output \ndrops very slowly, and the MP8759 reduces the \nswitching frequency to achieve high efficiency.  \n \nFigure 3: Light-Load Operation \nAs the output current increases from light-load \ncondition, the current modulator regulation time period becomes shorter. The HS-FET is turned \non more frequently, so the switching frequency \nincreases correspondingly. The output current reaches the critical level when the current modulator time is zero. The critical level of the output current is determined with Equation (1): \nIN OUT OUT\nOUT\nSW IN(V V ) VI2LF V\uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf0b4                  (1) \nThe device enters PWM mode once the output \ncurrent exceeds critical levels.

Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited. \n © 2017 MPS. All Rights Reserved. switching frequency stays fairly constant over the \noutput current range.  \nDC Auto-Tune Loop  \nThe MP8759 applies DC auto-tune loop to \nbalance the DC error between V FB and V REF by \nadjusting the comparator input REF to make V FB \nfollow V REF. This is a slow loop, so the load and \nline regulation improve without affecting the \ntransient performance. The relationship between \nVFB, VREF, and REF is shown in Figure 4. \n \nFigure 4: DC Auto-Tune Loop Operation \nExternal Ramp for Low Output Voltage  \nThe MP8759 uses an internal ramp \ncompensation control schem e to improve stability \nwith a pure ceramic output capacitor. In some operating cases, the internal ramp amplitude is \nnot sufficient to make the loop stable with \nceramic capacitors. Therefore, an extra external ramp around 20mV is needed for loop stabilization. Please refer to the Component Selection section in page 15 for details. \nLarge Duty Operation  \nThe MP8759 can support larger duty operations \nwith its internal T ON extension function. When the \npart detects that FB is lower than V REF, and VIN -\nVOUT < 2V, T ON and the duty cycle can be \nextended. T ON stops extending if FB is greater \nthan REF or if T ON meets its limitation. \nLight-Load Ultrasonic Mode (USM) \nUltrasonic mode (USM) is used to keep the \nswitching frequency above audible frequency \nareas during light-load or no-load conditions.  \nOnce the part detects that both the HS-FET and \nLS-FET are off for about 30µs, T ON shrinks to \nkeep VOUT under regulation with optimal \nefficiency. If the load continues reducing, then \nthe part discharges VOUT to ensure that FB is smaller than 102% of the internal reference. The HS-FET turns on again once the internal FB reaches V\nREF and then stops switching. \nUSM is selected by the MODE setting. Float \nMODE to operate the MP8759 in PFM mode with \nUSM in light-load condition.   Configuring the EN Control \nEN is a digital control pin that turns the regulator \non and off. Drive EN high to turn on the regulator. \nDrive EN low to turn off the regulator. \nTo start up the MP8759 automatically, pull EN up \nto the input voltage through a resistive voltage divider. Please refer to the UVLO Protection Section on page 14 for details. \nMODE Selection \nMODE is used to select the MP8759’s working mode. Pull MODE higher than 2.6V to operate the MP8759 in forced PWM mode. Float MODE to operate the MP8759 in PFM mode with USM \nat light load. Connect MODE to ground to \noperate the MP8759 in PFM mode without USM. \nSoft Start (SS) \nThe MP8759 employs a soft-start (SS) \nmechanism to ensure a smooth output during \npower-up. When EN rises high, the internal reference voltage and the output voltage ramp up gradually. Once the reference voltage reaches its target value, the soft start finishes and the circuit \nenters steady-state operation.  \nIf the output is pre-biased to a certain voltage \nduring start-up, the IC disables the switching of \nboth the high-side and low-side switches until the voltage on the internal reference exceeds the sensed output voltage at the internal FB node. \n \nPower Good (PG) \nThe MP8759 uses a power good (PG) output to \nindicate whether the output voltage of the buck regulator is ready or not. PG is the open drain of the MOSFET and should be connected to VCC \nor another voltage source through a resistor (e.g.: \n100k). After the input voltage is applied, the MOSFET is turned on and PG is pulled to GND before SS is ready. Once the FB voltage reaches 95% of V\nREF, PG is pulled high after a 500µs \ndelay. When the FB voltage drops to 85% of V REF, \nPG is pulled low. When the output voltage is higher than 115% of the internal reference, PG is pulled low. PG rises high again after the output voltage drops below 105% of the internal reference voltage. \nMP8759 – 26V, 8A, SYNCHRONOUS, STEP-DOWN CONVERTER \nMP8759 Rev. 1.1 www.MonolithicPower.com 14 \n4/13/2017 MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protec ted. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited. \n © 2017 MPS. All Rights Reserved. Over-Current Protection (OCP) \nThe MP8759 has a cycle-by-cycle over-current \nlimiting control. The current -limit circuit employs a \nvalley current-sensing algorithm. The part uses the R\nDS(ON)  of the LS-FET as a current-sensing \nelement. If the magnitude of the current-sense signal is above the current-limit threshold, PWM is not allowed to initiate a new cycle.  \nThe trip level is fixed internally. The inductor \ncurrent is monitored by the voltage between GND and SW. GND is used as the positive current sensing node so that GND should be connected to the source terminal of the bottom MOSFET. \nSince the comparison is done during the HS-FET \noff and LS-FET on states, the OC trip level sets the valley level of the inductor current. Thus, the load current at the over-current threshold (I\nOC) \ncan be calculated with Equation (2): \n\uf044\uf03d\uf02binductor\nOCII I_limit2               (2) \nIn an over-current condition, the current to the \nload exceeds the current to the output capacitor; \nand the output voltage can fall off. As a result, \nthe device encounters the under-voltage protection threshold and hiccup. \n \nOver-/Under-Voltage Protection (OVP/UVP)  \nThe MP8759 monitors the output voltage to \ndetect over-voltage and under-voltage. Once the \nfeedback voltage rises higher than 122% of the feedback voltage, the OVP comparator output goes high and the circuit turns off the HS-FET \ndriver. The LS-FET driver turns on, acting as a \ncurrent source. The output is then discharged to remain within the normal range. The MP8759 exits this regulation period when the feedback voltage falls below 117% of the reference voltage. \nWhen the feedback voltage falls below 75% of \nthe V\nREF but is higher than 50%, the UVP-1 \ncomparator output goes high, and the part attempts to restart with hiccup mode periodically for about 50µs if the feedback voltage remains in this range.  \nWhen the feedback voltage falls below 50% of \nV\nREF, the UVP-2 comparator output goes high \nand the part enters hiccup mode directly after the comparator and logic delay. \n Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) Protection  \nThe MP8759 can start up only when VIN is \nhigher than the under-voltage lockout (UVLO) \nrising threshold voltage. The MP8759 shuts down when VIN is lower than its falling threshold. The UVLO protection is non-latch off.  \nIf an application requires a higher under-voltage \nlockout (UVLO), use EN to adjust the input \nvoltage UVLO by adding two external resistors \n(see Figure 5).  \nIt is recommended to use the resistor divider to \nset the EN voltage above the EN rising threshold and below the 4.5V absolute maximum rating. \nThe rising threshold should be set to provide \nenough hysteresis to allow for any input supply variations. \nTo avoid an excessive sink current on EN, keep \nthe EN resistor (R\nUP) in the range of 1M Ω - 2MΩ. \nA typical pull-up resistor is 1.5M Ω. The R DOWN \nvalue can then be determined by R UP and  a \n600kΩ internal pull-down resistor. \n \n  \nFigure 5: Adjustable UVLO \nConnecting EN directly to a voltage source \nwithout a pull-up resistor requires limiting the \namplitude of the voltage source. The EN voltage must not exceed the 4.5V absolute maximum rating to avoid damaging the IC. \nThermal Shutdown \nThe MP8759 employs thermal shutdown. The \njunction temperature of the IC is monitored \ninternally. If the junction temperature exceeds the threshold value (typically 150°C), the converter shuts off. This is a non-latch protection. There is a hysteresis of about 25°C. Once the junction \ntemperature drops to about 125°C, a soft start is \ninitiated.\n \nOutput Discharge \nWhen EN is low, the MP8759 discharges the \noutput using an internal 6 Ω MOSFET. \nMP8759 – 26V, 8A, SYNCHRONOUS, STEP-DOWN CONVERTER \nMP8759 Rev. 1.1 www.MonolithicPower.com 15 \n4/13/2017 MPS Proprietary Information.

APPLICATION INFORMATION  \nCOMPONENT SELECTION \nSetting the Output Voltage with an E-\nCapacitor or POS Capacitor  \nFor applications that use an electrolytic capacitor \nor POS capacitor with a controlled ESR output is set as an output capacitor, external compensation is not need. The output voltage is \nset by feedback resistors R1 and R2 (see Figure \n6).  \n \nFigure 6: Simplified Circuit of POS Capacitor  \nThe value for R2 must be chosen carefully since \na small R2 value leads to considerable quiescent \ncurrent loss, while a value that is too large makes FB noise sensitive. R2 is recommended to be within 5k Ω - 100kΩ. Typically, set the current \nthrough R2 between 5µA - 30µA to create a good balance between the system stability and no-load \nloss. Considering the output ripple, calculate R1 \nwith Equation (3): \nOUT REF\nREFVVR1 R2V\uf02d\uf03d\uf0b4                (3) \nSetting the Output Voltage with a Pure \nCeramic Output Capacitor  \nThe MP8759 employs internal ramp \ncompensation. When the internal compensation is enough for a stable operation with the ceramic \noutput capacitors, the external resistor divider is \nused to set VOUT. First, choose a value for R2. Then R1 can be determined with Equation (4): \n OUT REF\nREFVVR1 R2V\uf02d\uf03d\uf0b4  (4) \nThe feedback circuit is shown in Figure 7. \n \nFigure 7: Feedback Network \nWhen the internal ramp compensation is not \nenough to stabilize the loop with a pure ceramic capacitor, an extra external voltage ramp around 20mV should be added to FB through resistor R4 \nand capacitor C5. \n \n \nFigure 8: External Ramp Compensation  \nFigure 8 shows a simplified external ramp compensation for PWM mode. V\nramp on FB can \nbe estimated with Equation (5): \n \uf02d\uf03d\uf0b4\uf0b4in out\nramp on\n45VVVTRC (5) \nFor better load or line regulation, use a lower \nVramp. Usually, V ramp is recommended to be \naround 20mV. \nThe MP8759 employs a DC auto-tune loop to \nbalance the DC error between V FB and V REF. VFB \ncan maintain 0.6V, even with an external ramp \ncompensation circuit.

An inductor with a larger value results in less ripple current and lower output ripple voltage. However, it also has a larger physical footprint, higher series \nresistance, and lower saturation current. A good \nrule for determining the inductance value is to design the peak-to-peak ripple current in the inductor to be in the range of 30% to 40% of the maximum output current to ensure that the peak \ninductor current is below the maximum switch \ncurrent limit. The inductance value can be calculated with Equation (8): \n OUT OUT\nSW L INVVL( 1 )FI V\uf03d\uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0b4\uf044 (8) \nWhere ∆IL is the peak-to-peak inductor ripple \ncurrent. The inductor should not saturate under the \nmaximum inductor peak current. The peak \ninductor current can be calculated with Equation \n(9): \nOUT OUT\nLP OUT\nSW INVVII ( 1 )2F L V\uf03d\uf02b \uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0b4        (9) \nSelecting the Input Capacitor \nThe input current to the step-down converter is \ndiscontinuous and therefore requires a capacitor \nto supply AC current to the step-down converter \nwhile maintaining the DC input voltage. Use ceramic capacitors placed as close to VIN as possible for best performance. Capacitors with X5R and X7R ceramic dielectrics are recommended because they are fairly stable with \ntemperature fluctuations.  \nThe capacitors must also have a ripple current \nrating greater than the maximum input ripple current of the converter. The input ripple current can be estimated with Equation (10): \nOUT OUT\nCIN OUT\nIN INVVII ( 1 )VV\uf03d\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d           (10) \nThe worst-case condition occurs at V IN = 2V OUT, \nshown in Equation (11): \nOUT\nCINII2\uf03d                         (11) \nFor simplification, choose an input capacitor with \nan RMS current rating greater than half of the \nmaximum load current. \nThe input capacitance value determines the input \nvoltage ripple of the converter. If there is an input voltage ripple requirement in the system, choose an input capacitor that meets the specification. \nThe input voltage ripple can be estimated with \nEquation (12): \nOUT OUT OUT\nIN\nSW IN IN INIV VV( 1 )FC V V\uf044\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0b4      (12) \nUnder worst-case conditions where V IN = 2V OUT, \nuse Equation (13): \nOUT\nIN\nSW INI 1V4F C\uf044\uf03d \uf0b4\uf0b4           (13) \nMP8759 – 26V, 8A, SYNCHRONOUS, STEP-DOWN CONVERTER \nMP8759 Rev. 1.1 www.MonolithicPower.com 17 \n4/13/2017 MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protec ted. Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplication Prohibited. \n © 2017 MPS. All Rights Reserved. Selecting the Output Capacitor \nThe output capacitor is required to maintain the \nDC output voltage. Ceramic or POS capacitors \nare recommended. The output voltage ripple can be estimated with Equation (14): \nOUT OUT\nOUT ESR\nSW IN SW OUTVV 1V( 1 ) ( R )FL V 8 FC\uf044\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02d \uf0b4 \uf02b\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf0b4  (14) \nWith ceramic capacitors, the impedance at the \nswitching frequency is dominated by the \ncapacitance. The output voltage ripple is mainly \ncaused by the capacitance. For simplification, the output voltage ripple can be estimated with Equation (15): \nOUT OUT\nOUT 2\nSW OUT INVVV( 1 )8F LC V\uf044\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4 \uf0b4            (15) \nIn the case of POS capacitors, the ESR \ndominates the impedance at the switching frequency. The output ripple can be approximated with Equation (16): \n  \nOUT OUT\nOUT ESR\nSW INVVV( 1 ) RFL V\uf044\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02d \uf0b4\uf0b4     (16) \nThe maximum output capacitor limitation should \nbe also considered during the design application. If the output capacitor value is too high, the output voltage cannot reach the design value \nduring the soft-start time and fails to regulate. \nThe maximum output capacitor value (C\no_MAX) \ncan be limited approximately with Equation (17): \nO_M A X L I M_A V G O U T s s O U TC( I I ) T / V\uf03d\uf02d \uf0b4       (17) \nWhere I LIM_AVG  is the average start-up current \nduring soft-start period, and T ss is the soft-start \ntime. The inductance value can be calculated with Equation (18): \nOUT OUT\nSW L INVVL( 1 )FI V\uf03d\uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0b4\uf044             (18) \nWhere ∆IL is the peak-to-peak inductor ripple \ncurrent. \nThe inductor should not saturate under the \nmaximum inductor peak current, including short \ncurrents. I sat is recommended to be greater than \n12A. PCB Layout Guidelines \nEfficient PBC layout is critical for stable operation. \nA four-layer layout is strongly recommended to \nachieve better thermal performance. For best results, refer to Figure 10 and follow the guidelines below. \n1. Place the high current paths (GND, IN, and \nSW) very close to the device with short, direct, \nand wide traces. \n2. Place the input capacitors as close to IN and \nGND as possible. \n3. Place the decoupling capacitor as close to \nVCC and GND as possible.  \n4. Keep the switching node SW short and away \nfrom the feedback network. \n5. Keep the BST voltage path as short as \npossible with traces greater than 50mil.   \n6. Keep the IN and GND pads connected with \nlarge copper traces to achieve better thermal \nperformance.  \n7. Add several vias with \n10mil_drill/18mil_copper_width close to the IN and GND pads to help with thermal dissipation. \n \nMP8759 – 26V, 8A, SYNCHRONOUS, STEP-DOWN CONVERTER \nMP8759 Rev. 1.1 www.MonolithicPower.com 18 \n4/13/2017 MPS Proprietary Information.
