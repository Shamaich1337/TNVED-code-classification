A highly efficient charge -pump voltage i nverter  \ngenerates an on -chip −5 V supply, which eliminates the need  for \na negative power supply for the driver and permits RS -232 \ncompatible output levels to be developed using charge pump  \ncapacitors as small as 0.1 μF.  \nA shutdown input disables the charge pump and puts the device \ninto a low power shutdown mode, in which the current \nconsumption  is typically less than 1 μA. The transmitter is \ndisabled  during shutdown but the receiver remains functional.   An epitaxial BiCMOS construction minimizes power consum ption \nto 3 mW and also guar ds against latch -up. Overvoltage protection  \nis provided allowing the receiver inputs to withstand continuous  \nvoltages in excess of ±30 V . In addition, all I -O pins  have ESD \nprotection to levels greater than 15 kV .  \nThe ADM101E  is available in a 10 -lead MSOP  package, which \nmakes it ideal for serial communications in small, portable  \napplications such as palmtop computers and mobile telephones, \nwhere a full, RS -232 serial interface is not required, but compact  \nsize and low power drain are paramount.  \n \n      \n \n    Craft Port is a trademark of Analog Devices, Inc.  \n Rev.

It is ideal for serial communication  \nin small portable devices suc h as mobile telephones, pal mtop \npersonal  computers and personal digital assistants, where a full, \nRS-232 serial interface is not required, and only Tx and Rx lines  \nare required for low speed communication between devices. The ADM101E  operates from a single, 5 V supply, and gen erates  \nits own, on -chip, −5 V power supply, thus removing the need \nfor a  negative power supply for the driver . \nRev. B | Page 8 of 12 \nData Sheet ADM101E \n \nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\nThe internal circuitry consists of three main sections. These are:  \n1. A charge pump dc -to-dc converter.  \n2. 5 V logic to EIA -232 driver.  \n3. EIA-232 to 5 V logic receiver.  \nCHARGE PUMP DC -DC CONVERTER  \nThe dc -dc converter generates a negative supply voltage from  \nthe 5 V supply, thus removing the need for a se parate −5 V rail. \nIt consists of an on -chip 200 kHz oscillator, switching matrix  \nand two external capacitors, as shown in Figure 9. \n \nFigure 9. Charge Pump DC –DC Converter  \nWhen S1 and S2 are closed, S3 and S4 are  open, and C1  charges \nto +V CC. S1 and S2 are then opened, while S3 and S4 are closed \nto connect C1 across C2, dumping charge into C2. Since the \npositive terminal of C2 is at ground, a negative voltage will be \nbuilt up on its negative terminal with each cyc le of the  oscill a-\ntor. This voltage depends on the current drawn from C2.  If the \ncurrent is small, the voltage will be close to − VCC, but will  fall as \nthe current drawn increases.  CHARGE PUMP CAPACITO RS A ND SUPPLY \nDECOUPLING  \nFor proper operation of the charge pump, the capacitors should  \nhave an equivalent series resistance (ESR) less than 1 Ω. As the \ncharge pump draws current puls es from V CC, the V CC decoup ling \ncapacitor should also have low ESR. The V CC decoupling capacitor  \nand V – reservoir capacitor should also have low ESR  because \nthey determine how effectively ESD pulses are clamped  to V CC \nor V − by the on -chip clamp diodes. Tan talum or mon olithic  \nceramic capacitors are suitable for these components. If  using \ntantalum capacitors, do not forget to observe polarity.   \nTRANSMITTER (DRIVER)  SECTION  \nThe driver converts 5 V logic input levels into RS -232 compat ible \noutput levels. With V CC = 5 V and driving an EIA -232 load,  the \noutput voltage swing is typically ±4.2 V .  \nRECEIVER SECTION  \nThe receivers are inverting level -shifters that accept EIA -232 \ninput levels and translate them into 5 V logic output levels. The \ninputs have internal 5 kΩ pull -down resistors to ground and  are \nalso protected against overvoltages of up to ± 25 V . The guara nteed \nswitching thresholds are 0.8 V minimum and 2.8 V max imum. \nAn unconnected receiver input is pulled to 0 V by  the internal \n5 kΩ pull-down resistor. This, therefore, results in a Logic 1 output  \nlevel for unconnected inputs or for inputs co nnected  to GND.  \nThe receivers have Schmitt trigger input with a hysteresis level  \nof 0.25 V . This ensures error -free reception for both noisy  \ninputs and for inputs with slow transition times. \nRev. B | Page 9 of 12 \nADM101E Data Sheet \n \nSHUTDOWN INPUT\nThe shutdown input allows the ADM101E  to be put into an  \nultralow power mode where the dc -dc converter is switched off  \nand the trans mitter is disabled. The receiver remains active  \nduring shutdown. Logic 0 at this input enables the ADM101E , \nwhile a Logic 1 at this input shuts down the ADM101E . \n \nRev.
