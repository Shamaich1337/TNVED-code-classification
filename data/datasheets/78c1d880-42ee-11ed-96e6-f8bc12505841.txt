It regulates input voltages from 4.5  V to 18 \nV down to an output voltage as low as 0.6  V , and supplies up \nto 2 A of load current.  \nThe AP2970  uses current -mode control to regulate the output \nvoltage. The output voltage is measured at FB through a resistive voltage divider and amplified through the internal \ntransconductance error amplifier. The converter uses  internal \nN-Channel MOSFET switches to step -down the input \nvoltage to the regulated output voltage.\n \nApplication Information  \n1. Setting the Output Voltage  \nThe output voltage is set using a resistive voltage divider \nfrom the output voltage to FB (see Typical Application \ncircuit). The voltage divider divides the output voltage down \nby the ratio:  \nVFB=VOUT×R1\nR1+R2 \nWhere V FB is the feedback voltage and V OUT is the output \nvoltage.  \nThus the output voltage is:  \nVOUT=0.6V×(1+R2\nR1) \n \n2. Inductor   \nThe inductor is required to supply constant current to the \noutput load while being driven by the switched input voltage. \nA larger value inductor will result in less ripple current that \nwill result in lower output ripple voltage. However, the larger \nvalue inductor will have a larger physical size, higher series \nresistance, and/or lower saturation current. A good rule for \ndetermining the inductance to use is to allow the peak -to-\npeak ripple current in the inductor to be approximately 30  % \nof the maximum switch current limit. Also, make sure that \nthe peak inductor current is below the maximum switch \ncurrent limit. The inductance value can be calculated by:  \nL=VOUT×(VIN-VOUT)\nVIN×∆IL×FS \nWhere V OUT is the output voltage, V IN is the input voltage, \nFS is the switc hing frequency, and ΔI L is the peak -to-peak \ninductor ripple current.  \nChoose an inductor that will not saturate under the maximum \ninductor peak current. The peak inductor current can be \ncalculated by:  \nILP=ILOAD +VOUT\n2×FS×L×(1-VOUT\nVIN) \nHere I LOAD is the load cu rrent.  \nThe choice of which style inductor to use mainly depends on \nthe price vs. size requirements and any EMI requirements.  \nVendor  P/N L \n(µ H)  DCR  \n(mΩ)  Isat \n(A) \nSunlord  SWPA 5040 4.7 30 3.5 \nTabl e 1. Recommended Inductors  \n \n 3. Input Capacitor  \nThe input current to the step -down converter is discontinuous, \ntherefore a capacitor is required to supply the AC current to \nthe step -down converter while maintaining the DC input \nvoltage. Use low ESR capacitors for the best performance. \nCeramic capacitors are prefe rred, but tantalum or low -ESR \nelectrolytic capacitors may also suffice. Choose X5R or X7R \ndielectrics when using ceramic capacitors. Since the input \ncapacitor absorbs the input switching current it requires an \nadequate ripple current rating. The RMS curren t in the input \ncapacitor can be estimated by:  \nIC1=ILOAD ×√(1-VOUT\nVIN)×VOUT\nVIN \nThe worst -case condition occurs at V IN = 2V OUT, where I C1 = \nILOAD/2. For simplification, choose the input capacitor whose \nRMS current rating greater than half of the maximum load \ncurrent. The input capacitor can be electrolytic, tantalum or \nceramic. When using electrolytic or tantalum capacitors, a \nsmall, high quality 0.1  μF ceramic capacitor should be placed \nas close to the IC as possible. When using ceramic capacitors, \nmake sure tha t they have enough capacitance to provide \nsufficient charge to prevent excessive voltage ripple at input. \nThe input voltage ripple for low ESR capacitors can be \nestimated by:  \n∆VIN=ILOAD\n𝐶1×𝐹𝑆×VOUT\nVIN(1-VOUT\nVIN) \nHere C1 is the value of the input capacitor.  \nIn hot plug applications, the input needs to be connected in \nparallel with an electrolytic capacitor above 100 µF to \nprevent IC damage.  \n \n4. Output Capacitor  \nThe output capacitor is required to maintain the DC output \nvoltage. The output voltage ripple can b e estimated by:  \n∆VOUT=VOUT\nFS×L×(1-VOUT\nVIN)×(RESR+1\n8×FS×C2) \nWhere C2 is the output capacitance value and R ESR is the \nequivalent series resistance (ESR) value of the output \ncapacitor. In the case of ceramic capacitors, the impedance at \nthe switching frequency is dominated by the capacitance. \nThe output voltage ripple is mainly caused by the capacitance. \nFor simpli fication, the output voltage ripple can be estimated \nby:  \n∆VOUT=VOUT\n8×FS2×L×C2×(1-VOUT\nVIN) \nIn the case of tantalum or electrolytic capacitors, the ESR \ndominates the impedance at the switching frequency.

The power traces, including the GND trace, the LX trace \nand the VIN trace should be kept short, direct and wide.  \n2. The FB pin should be connected directly to the feedback \nresistor. The resistive divider R1/R2 must be connected \nbetween the (+) plate of C2 and ground.  \n3. Connect the (+) plate of C1 to the IN pin of AP2970  as \nclosely as possible. This capacitor provides the AC current \nto internal power MOSFET.  \n4. Keep the switching nod e, LX , away from the sensitive FB \nnode.  \n5. Keep the ( -) plates of C1 and C2 as close as possible.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\nAP2970   Chipown  \n \n \nwww.chipown.com                                                                                       Wuxi Chipown Microelectronics Limited                                                   Rev. 1.3                            6/10  Typical Performance Characteristics  \nAll curves taken at V IN = 12 V, V OUT = 3.3  V with configuration in Typical Application Circuit shown in this datasheet.

It integrates both the main and synchronous switches, which feature low on-resistance to minimize conduction losses. The device employs a Constant On-Time (COT) control architecture, allowing for fast transient response and high efficiency, particularly at light loads. The converter is capable of stepping down input voltages from 4.5 V to 18 V to a regulated output voltage as low as 0.6 V, making it suitable for various applications requiring efficient power management.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Set Top Boxes**
- **Portable TVs**
- **Access Point Routers**
- **DSL Modems**
- **LCD TVs**

The AP2970 is ideal for applications where space is limited and efficiency is critical, such as in consumer electronics and communication devices. Its compact SOT-23-6L package and integrated features make it a versatile choice for designers looking to implement reliable power management solutions.
