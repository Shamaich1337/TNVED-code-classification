This device is \ndesigned for use in broadband, moderate signal, \nhigh performance, switch applications up to 20 GHz. \nIt is a surface mountable switch configured for \noptimized performance and offers a distinct \nadvantage over MMIC, beamlead and chip and wire \nhybrid designs. Because the PIN diodes of the \nMASW -004103 -1365 are integrated into the chip \nand kept within close proximity, the parasitics \ntypically associated with other designs that use \nindividual components are kept to a minimum.  \n \nTo minimize the parasitics and achieve high \nperformance the MASW -003103 -1364 is fabricated \nusing MACOMs ’ patented HMIC ™ (Heterolithic \nMicrowave Integrated Circuit) process. This process \nallows the silicon pedestals, which form the series \nand shunt diodes or vias, to be imbeded in low loss, \nlow dispersion glass. The combination of low loss \nglass and using tight spacing between elements \nresults in an HMIC device with low loss and high \nisolation through low millimeter wave frequencies.  \n \nThe topside is fully encapsulated with silicon nitride \nand also has an additional layer of polymer for \nscratch and impact protection. The protective \ncoating guards against damage to the junction and \nthe anode airbridges during handling and assembly.  \n \nOn the backside of the chip gold metalized pads \nhave been added to produce a solderable surmount \ndevice.  * Restrictions on Hazardous Substances, compliant to current \nRoHS EU directive.  \n2 2 \nMACOM Technology Solutions Inc.

The backside area of the die is the RF and DC ground \nreturn and the DC return is through the common Port J1. A constant current source should be used to supply the \nDC control currents.

V4  HMICTM Silicon PIN Diode SP3T Switch  \n50 MHz - 20 GHz  \nHandling Procedures  \nPlease observe the following precautions to avoid \ndamage:  \n \nAttachment to a circuit board is made simple through \nthe use of standard surface mount technology. \nMounting pads are conveniently located on the          \nbottom surface of these devices and are removed \nfrom the active junction locations.  \n \nThese devices are well suited for solder attachment \nonto hard and soft substrates. The use of \n80Au/20Sn, or RoHS compliant solders is                \nrecommended. For applications where the average \npower is ≤ 1W, conductive silver epoxy may also be \nused. Cure per manufacturers recommended time \nand temperature. Typically 1 hour at 150°C.  \n \nWhen soldering these devices to a hard substrate, a \nsolder re -flow method is preferred. A vacuum tip pick\n-up tool and a force of 60 to100 grams applied to the \ntop surface of the device while placing the chip is \nrecommended.  \n \nWhen soldering to soft substrates, such as Duroid, it \nis recommended to use a soft solder at the circuit \nboard to mounting pad interface to minimize stress \ndue to any TCE mismatches that may exist. Position \nthe die so that its mounting pads are aligned with the \ncircuit board mounting pads.  \n \nSolder reflow should not be performed by causing \nheat to flow through the top surface of the die to the \nback. Since the HMIC glass is transparent, the           \nedges of the mounting pads can be visually                   \ninspected through the die after attachment is             \ncompleted. Typical re -flow profiles for Sn60/Pb40 \nand RoHS compliant solders is provided in Applica-\ntion Note M538, “Surface Mounting Instructions “ and \ncan viewed on the MACOM Technology Solutions             \nwebsite @ www.macom.com  Static Sensitivity  \nThese electronic devices  are sensitive to \nelectrostatic discharge (ESD) and can be damaged \nby static electricity.
