General description\nThe 74AVC4T245 is an 4-bit, dual supply transceiver that enables bidirectional level translation.\nThe device can be used as two 2-bit transceivers or as a 4-bit transceiver. It features four 2-bit\ninput-output ports (nAn and nBn), a direction control input (nDIR), a output enable input (n OE)\nand dual supply pins (V CC(A)  and V CC(B) ). Both V CC(A)  and V CC(B)  can be supplied at any voltage\nbetween 0.8 V and 3.6 V making the device suitable for translating between any of the low voltage\nnodes (0.8 V, 1.2 V, 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V and 3.3 V). Pins nAn, nOE and nDIR are referenced to\nVCC(A)  and pins nBn are referenced to V CC(B) . A HIGH on nDIR allows transmission from nAn to\nnBn and a LOW on nDIR allows transmission from nBn to nAn. The output enable input (n OE) can\nbe used to disable the outputs so the buses are effectively isolated.\nThe device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing any damaging backflow current through the device when it is\npowered down. In suspend mode when either V CC(A)  or V CC(B)  are at GND level, both nAn and nBn\nare in the high-impedance OFF-state.\n2.

### Component Summary: 74AVC4T245PW

**General Description:**
The 74AVC4T245 is a 4-bit dual supply translating transceiver designed for bidirectional level translation. It can function as two 2-bit transceivers or as a single 4-bit transceiver. The device supports configurable voltage translation between two different supply voltages, making it suitable for interfacing between various low voltage nodes.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - VCC(A): 0.8 V to 3.6 V
  - VCC(B): 0.8 V to 3.6 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Maximum supply current per VCC pin: 100 mA
  - Output current (IO): ±50 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Total power dissipation varies by package type:
    - SO16: 500 mW
    - TSSOP16: 250 mW
    - Other packages have similar or lower ratings.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - TSSOP16 (74AVC4T245PW): Plastic thin shrink small outline package; 16 leads; body width 4.4 mm.

- **Special Features:**
  - Supports multiple voltage standards (0.8 V to 3.6 V).
  - ESD protection: HBM exceeds 8000 V, MM exceeds 200 V, CDM exceeds 1000 V.
  - Maximum data rates: Up to 380 Mbit/s depending on voltage levels.
  - IOFF circuitry for partial power-down mode operation.
  - High-impedance OFF-state in suspend mode.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL according to JEDEC J-STD-020E is typically MSL 1.

**Description:**
The 74AVC4T245 is a versatile transceiver that allows for the translation of signals between different voltage levels, making it ideal for applications where devices operating at different voltages need to communicate. It features a direction control input (nDIR) to manage the data flow direction and an output enable input (nOE) to isolate the buses when necessary.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Level Shifting:** Used in systems where components operate at different voltage levels, such as interfacing 3.3 V logic with 1.8 V or 2.5 V logic.
- **Data Communication:** Suitable for applications in communication protocols where voltage translation is required.
- **Microcontroller Interfacing:** Often used in microcontroller designs to connect peripherals that operate at different voltage levels.
- **Power Management:** Can be utilized in power management circuits to ensure proper voltage levels are maintained across devices.

This component is particularly useful in modern electronic designs where low power consumption and compatibility with various voltage levels are critical.
