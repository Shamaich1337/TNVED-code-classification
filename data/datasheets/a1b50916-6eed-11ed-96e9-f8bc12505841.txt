The device isbyte controlled. Each byte has separate Output Enable and Latch Enableinputs. These control pins can be tied together for full 16 −bit operation.\nHigh impedance TTL compatible inputs significantly reduce currentloading to input drivers while TTL compatible outputs offer improvedswitching noise performance. A V\nI specification of 5.5 V allows\nMC74LCX16373 inputs to be safely driven from 5.0 V devices.\nThe MC74LCX16373 contains 16 D −type latches with 3 −state\n5.0 V−tolerant outputs. When the Latch Enable (LEn) inputs are HIGH,\ndata on the Dn inputs enters the latches. In this condition, the latches aretransparent, i.e., a latch output will change state each time its D inputchanges. When LE is LOW, the latches store the information that waspresent on the D inputs a se tup time preceding the HIGH −to−LOW\ntransition of LE. The 3 −state outputs are controlled by the Output\nEnable (OEn\n) inputs. When OE  is LOW, the outputs are enabled. When\nOE is HIGH, the standard outputs are in the high impedance state, but\nthis does not interfere with new data entering into the latches.\nFeatures\n•Designed for 2.3 to 3.6 V V CC Operation\n•5.4 ns Maximum t pd\n•5.0 V Tolerant − Interface Capability With 5.0 V TTL Logic\n•Supports Live Insertion and Withdrawal\n•IOFF Specification Guarantees High Impedance When V CC = 0 V\n•LVTTL Compatible\n•LVCMOS Compatible\n•24 mA Balanced Output Sink and Source Capability\n•Near Zero Static Supply Current in All Three Logic States (20 /C0109A)\nSubstantially Reduces System Power Requirements\n•Latchup Performance Exceeds 500 mA\n•ESD Performance:\n♦Human Body Model >2000 V\n♦Machine Model >200 V\n•These Devices are Pb −Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free and are RoHS\nCompliantMARKING DIAGRAMTSSOP−48\nDT SUFFIX\nCASE 1201148\nA = Assembly Location\nWL = Wafer Lot\nYY = Year\nWW = Work WeekG = Pb −Free Package148\nLCX16373G\nAWLYYWW\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information in the package\ndimensions section on page 3 of this data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATION\nhttp://onsemi.com\nMC74LCX16373\nhttp://onsemi.com\n248 1 LE1 OE1\n47 2 D0 O0\n46 3 D1 O1\n45 4 GND GND\n44 5 D2 O2\n43 6 D3 O3\n42 7 VCC VCC\n41 8 D4 O4\n40 9 D5 O5\n39 10 GND GND\n38 11 D6 O6\n37 12 D7 O7\n36 13 D8 O8\n35 14 D9 O9\n34 15 GND GND\n33 16 D10 O10\n32 17 D11 O11\n31 18 VCC VCC\n30 19 D12 O12\n29 20 D13 O13\n28 21 GND GND\n27 22 D14 O14\n26 23 D15 O15\n25 24 LE2 OE2O0\nD0\nO1\nD1\nO2\nD2\nO3\nD3\nO4\nD4\nO5\nD5\nO6\nD6\nO7\nD7nLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nDLE1OE1\nO8\nD8\nO9\nD9\nO10\nD10\nO11\nD11\nO12\nD12\nO13\nD13\nO14\nD14\nO15\nD15nLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nD\nnLE\nQ\nDLE2OE21\n4824\n25\n2\n47\n3\n46\n5\n44\n6\n43\n8\n41\n9\n40\n11\n38\n12\n3713\n36\n14\n35\n16\n33\n17\n32\n19\n30\n20\n29\n22\n27\n23\n26\nFigure 1.

### Component Summary: MC74LCX16373DTG

**Description:**
The MC74LCX16373 is a low-voltage CMOS 16-bit transparent latch designed for operation with a supply voltage ranging from 2.3 V to 3.6 V. It features 5 V-tolerant inputs and outputs, making it compatible with 5 V TTL logic. The device is byte-controlled, allowing for separate output enable and latch enable inputs for each byte, which can be tied together for full 16-bit operation. The latches are transparent when the latch enable inputs are HIGH, allowing data to flow through, and they store data when the latch enable inputs are LOW.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Operating Voltage (VCC): 2.3 V to 3.6 V
  - Input Voltage (VI): 0 to 5.5 V
  - Output Voltage (VO): 0 to VCC + 0.5 V (for HIGH or LOW state)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Source/Sink Current (IO): ±50 mA
  - Balanced Output Sink and Source Capability: 24 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Quiescent Supply Current (ICC): 20 µA (typical at VCC = 3.6 V)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Storage Temperature (TSTG): -65 °C to +150 °C
  - Operating Temperature (TA): -55 °C to +125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - TSSOP-48 (Thin Shrink Small Outline Package)

- **Special Features:**
  - 5.0 V tolerant inputs and outputs
  - Supports live insertion and withdrawal
  - Near zero static supply current in all three logic states
  - Latchup performance exceeds 500 mA
  - ESD performance: Human Body Model >2000 V, Machine Model >200 V
  - Pb-Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free, and RoHS compliant

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL 1 (no special precautions needed for soldering)

**Typical Applications:**
The MC74LCX16373 is commonly used in applications requiring data storage and transfer, such as:
- Data buffering and latching in digital circuits
- Interface between 3.3 V and 5 V logic systems
- Memory storage in microcontroller applications
- Signal processing in communication systems
- General-purpose data handling in various electronic devices

This component is ideal for use in low-power applications where space is a constraint, and it provides flexibility in interfacing with different voltage levels.
