B | Page 14 of 17 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe HMC8401 is a GaAs, pHEMT, MMIC low noise amplifier. \nIts basic architecture is that of a cascode distributed amplifier \nwith an integrated resistor for the drain. The cascode distributed architectur e uses a fundamental cell consisting of a stack of two \nfield effect transistors (FETs) with the source of the upper FET connected  to drain of the lower FET. The fundamental cell is then \nduplicated several times  with an RFIN transmission line intercon -\nnecti ng the gates of the lower FETs and an RFOUT transmission \nline interconnecting the drains of the upper FETs.  \nAdditional circuit design techniques are used around each cell to optimize the overall bandwidth and noise figure. The major \nbenefit of this archit ecture is that a low noise figure is maintained  \nacross a bandwidth far greater than what a single instance of the \nfundamental cell provides. A simplified schematic of this \narchitecture is shown in  Figure 42.  \n13850-041RFINVGG2ACG\nRFOUT\nVGG1T-LINE\nT-LINEVDD\nACG ACG \nFigure 42. Architecture and Simplified Schematic   \n \n  \n Though the gate bias voltages of the upper FETs are set internally \nby a resistive voltage divider tapped off of V\nDD, the V GG2 pad is  \nprovided to allow the user an optional means of changing the gate bias of the upper FETs. Adjustment of the V\nGG2 voltage \nacross the range from −2 V through +2.4 V changes the gate bias of \nthe upper FETs, thus affecting gain changes of approximately  4 dB, \ndepending on frequency. Increasing the voltage applied to V GG2 \nincreases the gain, while decreasing the voltage decreases the gain. For the nominal V\nDD = 7.5 V , the resulting V GG2 open  \ncircuit voltage is approximately 2.06 V .  \nA voltage applied to the V GG1 pad sets the gate bias of the lower \nFETs, providing control of the drain current. Unlike the upper FETs, a gate bias voltage for the lower FETs is not generated internally.  For this reason, the application of a bias voltage to the \nV\nGG1 pad is required and not optional . \nTo operate the HMC8401  at voltages lower than the nominal 7.5  V,  \nuse a bias tee to apply 5.25 V to the drain via the RFOUT pad.  \nWhen using this alternate bias configuration , leave  the V DD pad \nopen and adjust VGG1 to obtain a nominal quiescent I DD = 60 mA.  \nThough data taken using the alternate bias configuration  is not \npresented on this data sheet, the resulting performance differ s only \nslightly from that obtained using the typical b ias configuration . The \nsmall signal gain is  a few tenths of dB greater, the compression \ncharacteristics are slightly harder, and the noise figure characteristics \nremain mostly unchanged.  \nFor additional information regarding this alternate bias \nconfiguration , contact Analog Devices Applications.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet HMC8401  \n \nRev. B | Page 15 of 17 APPL ICATIONS INFORMATION  \nBIASING PROCEDURES  \nCapacitive bypassing is required for V DD and VGG1, as shown in \nthe typical application circuit  in Figure 44. Gain control is \npossible through the application of a dc voltage to V GG2. If gain \ncontrol is used, then V GG2 must be bypassed by 100 pF,  0.1 µF, and \n4.7 µF capacitors. If gain control is not used, then V GG2 can be \neither left open or capacitively bypassed as described.  \nThe recommended bias sequence during power -up is as follows: \n1. Set VGG1 to −2.0 V to  pinch off the channels of the lower \nFETs.   \n2. Set V DD to 7.5 V . Because the lower FETs are pinched  off, \nIDQ remain s very low upon application of V DD. \n3. Adjust VGG1 to be  more positive until the desired quiescent \ndrain current is  obtained.  \n4. Apply the RF input signal.  \n5. If the gain control function is to be used, apply to V GG2 a \nvoltage within the range of −2.0 V to +2.4 V until the \ndesired gain is achieved.  \nUse of the V GG2 (the gain control function) a ffect s the drain \ncurrent.  \nThe recommended bias sequence during  power -down is as follows : \n1. Turn off the RF input signal.  \n2. Remove the V GG2 voltage or set it to 0 V .  \n3. Set VGG1 to −2.0 V to pinch  off the channels of the lower \nFETs.  \n4. Set V DD t o  0  V.  \n5. Set VGG1 t o  0  V.  \nPower -up and power -down sequences may differ from the ones \ndescribed, though care must  always be taken to ensure adherence \nto the values shown in the Absolute Maximum Ratings . \nUnless otherwise noted, all measurements and data shown  \nwere taken using the typical application circuit (see Figure 44), \nconfigured  as shown on th e assembly diagram (see Figure 45) \nand biased pe r the conditions in th is section. The bias conditions \nshown in th is section are the operating points recommended to \noptimize the overall performance. Operation using other bias conditions may provide performance  that differs from what is \nshown in this data sheet. To obtain the best performance while not damaging the device , follow the recommended biasing \nsequence outlined in this section.  \nMOUNTING AND BONDING  TECHNIQUES FOR \nMILLIMETERWAVE G aAs MMICs  \nAttach the die directly to the ground plane eutectically or with \nconductive epoxy.  To bring RF to and from the chip, use 50 Ω \nmicrostrip transmission lines on 0.127 mm (5 mil) thick alumina \nthin film substrates (see  Figure 43).

Routing RF Signals  with Molytab   \nTo minimize bond wire length, place microstrip substrates as \nclose to the die as possible. Typical die to substrate spacing is \n0.076 mm to 0.152 mm (3 mil to 6 mil).  \nHandling Precautions  \nTo avoid permanent damage, adhere to the following pre cautions:  \n• All bare die ship in either waffle or gel -based ESD protective  \ncontainers, sealed in an ESD protective bag. After the sealed \nESD protective bag is opened,  store all die in a dry nitrogen \nenvironment.  \n• Handle the chips in a clean environment. Never  use liquid \ncleaning systems to clean the chip.  \n• Follow ESD precautions to protect against ESD strikes.  \n• While bias is applied, suppress instrument and bias supply \ntransients. To minimize inductive pickup, use shielded signal and bias cables.  \n• Handle the chi p along the edges with a vacuum collet or \nwith a sharp pair of bent tweezers. The surface of the chip \nmay have fragile air bridges and must not be touched with \nvacuum collet, tweezers, or fingers . \nMounting \nThe chip is back metallized and can be die mounted  with  gold/tin \n(AuSn ) eutectic preforms or with electrically conductive epoxy. \nThe mounting surface must be clean and flat.  \nEutectic Die Attach  \nIt is best to use an 80% gold/20% tin preform with a work surface  \ntemperature of 255°C and a tool temperature of  265°C. When \nhot 90%  nitrogen/10% hydrogen gas is applied, maintain tool tip \ntemperature  at 290°C. Do not expose the chip to a temperature \ngreater than 320°C for more than 20 sec. No more than 3 sec of \nscrubbing is required for attachment.  \nEpoxy Die Attach  \nABLETHERM 2600BT is recommended  for die attachment . \nApply a minimum amount of epoxy to the mounting surface so \nthat a thin epoxy fillet is observed around the perimeter of the chip after placing it into position. Cure the epoxy per the  schedule \nprovided b y the manufacturer.  \nHMC8401  Data Sheet \n \nRev.
