The \ncombined (V POS and V NEG) efficiency reaches 85% \nto keep systems cool or achieve a longer battery-on-\ntime. The input voltage range of 2.7 V to 5.5 V allows \nthe devices to be powered from batteries or from fixed \n3.3-V or 5-V rails.\nThe converter operates with a fixed frequency \nPWM control topology and, when operating in power-\nsave mode, uses a pulse-skipping mode at light-\nload currents. It operates with only 500-µA device \nquiescent current.\nIndependent enable pins allow flexible power-up and \npower-down sequencing for both outputs. The positive \nand negative outputs operate independently, allowing \nfor non-symmetrical output voltages and currents.\nThe converter has an internal current limit, \novervoltage protection, and a thermal shutdown for \nhighest reliability under fault conditions. The converter \nis available in a 4-mm × 4-mm VQFN-24 package. \nThe solution size is small with a minimum switching \nfrequency of 1.25 MHz for smaller inductors and few \nother external components required.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS65130\nVQFN (24) 4.00 mm × 4.00 mm\nTPS65131\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nBSW\nINN\nVINVPOS\nFBP\nVREFC1VIN\nR1\nR2C4VPOS\nINP\nAGNDL1\nPSP\nENN\nPSNENPQ1\nR7\nC3 C2FBN\nVNEG\nOUTN\nCN\nCP\nPGNDC9\nR4C8\nR3C10\nVNEG\nL2 C6C7C5D1\nD2\nSimplified ApplicationTPS65130 , TPS65131\nSLVS493E  – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Both converters work independently of each other. They only share a common clock and a \ncommon voltage reference. Both outputs are separately controlled by a fixed-frequency, pulse-width-modulated \n(PWM) regulator. In general, each converter operates at continuous conduction mode (CCM). At light loads, \nthe negative converter can enter discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). As the load current decreases, the \nconverters can enter a power-save mode if enabled. This works independently at both converters. Output \nvoltages can go up to 15 V at the boost output and down to –15 V at the inverter output.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nBoost Converter Control\nInverting Converter ControlOscillatorTemperature \nControlGate \nControl\nVref\nGate \nControlVPOS\nINNVIN VINVIN\nVININP\nENPVIN VIN\nPSP\nCP\nBSW\nENN\nPSN\nCN\nINN\nAGNDVPOS\nFBP\nVREF\nFBN\nOUTN\nPGNDVNEG+\n-+\n±\n+±\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Power Conversion\nBoth converters operate in a fixed-frequency, PWM control scheme. So, the ON-time of the switches varies \ndepending on input-to-output voltage ratio and the load. During this ON-time, the inductors connected to the \nconverters charge with current. In the remaining time, the time period set by the fixed operating frequency, the \ninductors discharge into the output capacitors through the rectifier diodes. Usually at greater loads, the inductor \ncurrents are continuous. At lighter loads, the boost converter uses an additional internal switch to allow current \nflowing back to the input. This avoids inductor current becoming discontinuous in the boost converter. So, the \nboost converter is always controlled in a continuous current mode. At the inverting converter, during light loads, \nthe inductor current can become discontinuous. In this case, the control circuit of the inverting controller output \nautomatically takes care of these changing conditions to always operate with an optimum control setup.TPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022 www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\n7.3.2 Control\nThe controller circuits of both converters employ a fixed-frequency, multiple-feedforward controller topology. The \ncircuits monitor input voltage, output voltage, and voltage drop across the switches. Changes in the operating \nconditions of the converters directly affect the duty cycle and must not take the indirect and slow way through \nthe output voltage control loops. Measurement errors in this feedforward system are corrected by a self-learning \ncontrol system. An external capacitor damps the output to avoid output-voltage steps due to output changes of \nthis selflearning control system.\nThe voltage loops, determined by the error amplifiers, must only handle small signal errors. The error amplifiers \nfeature internal compensation. Their inputs are the feedback voltages on the FBP and FBN pins. The device \nuses a comparison of these voltages with the internal reference voltage to generate an accurate and stable \noutput voltage.\n7.3.3 Enable\nBoth converters can be enabled or disabled individually. Applying a logic HIGH signal at the enable pins (ENP \nfor the boost converter, ENN for the inverting converter) enables the corresponding output. After enabling, \ninternal circuitry necessary to operate the specific converter turns on followed by the soft-start period.\nApplying a low signal at the enable ENP or ENN pin shuts down the corresponding converter. When both enable \npins are low, the device enters shutdown mode, where all internal circuitry turns off. At this point, the device \nconsumes shutdown current flowing into the VIN pin. The output loads of the converters can be disconnected \nfrom the input, see Section 7.3.4 .\n7.3.4 Load Disconnect\nThe device supports completely disconnecting the load when the converters are disabled. For the inverting \nconverter, the device turns off the internal PMOS switch. If the inverting converter is turned off, no DC current \npath remains which could discharge the battery or supply.\nThis is different for the boost converter. The external rectifying diode, together with the boost inductor, form a \nDC current path which could discharge the battery or supply if any load connects to the output. The device has \nno internal switch to prevent current from flowing. For this reason, the device offers a PMOS gate control output \n(BSW) to enable and disable a PMOS switch in this DC current path, ideally directly between the boost inductor \nand battery. To be able to fully disconnect the battery, the forward direction of the parasitic backgate diode of this \nswitch must point to the battery or supply. The external PMOS switch, which connects to BSW, turns on when \nthe boost converter is enabled and turns off when the boost converter is disabled.\n7.3.5 Soft-Start\nBoth converters have implemented soft-start functions. When each converter is enabled, the implemented switch \ncurrent limit ramps up slowly to its nominal programmed value in about 1 ms. Soft-start is implemented to \nlimit the input current during start-up to avoid high peak currents at the battery which could interfere with \nother systems connected to the same battery. Without soft-start, the high input peak current could trigger the \nimplemented switch current limit, which can lead to a significant voltage drops across the series resistance of the \nbattery and its connections.\n7.3.6 Overvoltage Protection\nBoth converters (boost and inverter) have implemented individual overvoltage protection. If the feedback voltage \nunder normal operation exceeds the nominal value by typically 5%, the corresponding converter shuts down \nimmediately to protect any connected circuitry from possible damage.\n7.3.7 Undervoltage Lockout\nAn undervoltage lockout (UVLO) prevents the device from starting up and operating if the supply voltage at the \nVIN pin is lower than the undervoltage lockout threshold. For this case, the device automatically shuts down both \nconverters when the supply voltage at VIN falls below this threshold. Nevertheless, parts of the control circuits \nremain active, which is different than device shutdown.www.ti.comTPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\n7.3.8 Overtemperature Shutdown\nThe device automatically shuts down both converters if the implemented internal temperature sensor detects a \nchip temperature above the thermal shutdown temperature. It automatically starts operating again when the chip \ntemperature falls below this thermal shutdown temperature. The built-in hysteresis avoids undefined operation \ncaused by ringing from shutdown and prevents operating at a temperature close to the overtemperature \nshutdown threshold.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Power-Save Mode\nThe power-save mode can improve efficiency at light loads. In power-save mode, the converter only operates \nwhen the output voltage falls below the threshold voltage that is internally set by the device. The converter \nramps up the output voltage with one or several operating pulses and goes again into power-save mode once \nthe inductor current becomes discontinuous.\nThe PSN and PSP logic level selects between power-save mode and continuous-conduction mode. If the \nspecific pins (PSP for the boost converter, PSN for the inverting converter) are HIGH, the power-save mode for \nthe corresponding converter operates at light loads. Similarly, a LOW on the PSP pin or PSN pin disables the \npower-save mode for the corresponding converter.\n7.4.2 Full Operation with V IN > 2.7 V\nThe recommended minimum input supply voltage for the TPS65130/1 device is 2.7 V. Above this voltage, the \ndevice achieves the performance described in this data sheet.\n7.4.3 Limited Operation with V UVLO < V IN < 2.7 V\nWith input supply voltages between V UVLO and 2.7 V, the device continues to operate. No functions are disabled, \nbut full performance is not ensured.\n7.4.4 No Operation with V IN < V UVLO\nThe TPS6513x enters an undervoltage lockout condition when the input supply voltage is below the UVLO \nthreshold. In this mode, all device functions are disabled, and the input supply current consumption is minimized. \nSee also Section 7.3.7 .TPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\n8 Applications and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Because the recommended input voltage goes up to 5.5 V, \nthe device is also suitable for 3-cell alkaline, NiCd, or NiMH batteries, as well as any regulated supply voltages \nfrom 2.7 V to 5.5 V. It provides two independent output voltage rails which are programmed as follows.\n8.2.2.1 Programming the Output Voltage\n8.2.2.1.1 Boost Converter\nThe output voltage of the TPS65130/1 boost converter stage can be adjusted with an external resistor divider \nconnected to the FBP pin. The typical value of the voltage at the FBP pin is the reference voltage, which is 1.213 \nV. The maximum recommended output voltage at the boost converter is 15 V. To achieve appropriate accuracy, \nthe current through the feedback divider should be about 100 times greater than the current into the FBP pin. \nTypical current into the FBP pin is 0.05 µA, and the voltage across R2 is 1.213 V. Based on those values, the \nrecommended value for R2 should be lower than 200 kΩ to set the divider current at 5 µA to 10 µA.\nCalculate the value of resistor R1, as a function of the needed output voltage (V POS), with Equation 1 :TPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\nPOS\nrefVR1 R2 1V§ ·  u \x10¨ ¸ \n© ¹ (1)\nIn this example, with R2 = 130 kΩ, choose R1 = 1 MΩ to set V POS = 10.5 V.\n8.2.2.1.2 Inverting Converter\nThe output voltage of the inverting converter stage can also be adjusted with an external resistor divider. It must \nbe connected to the FBN pin. Unlike the feedback divider at the boost converter, the reference point of the \nfeedback divider is not GND but V REF. So the typical value of the voltage at the FBN pin is 0 V. The minimum \nrecommended output voltage at the inverting converter is –15 V. Feedback divider current considerations are \nsimilar to the considerations at the boost converter. For the same reasons, the feedback divider current should \nbe in the range of 5 µA or greater. The voltage across R4 is 1.213 V. Based on those values, the recommended \nvalue for R4 should be lower than 200 kΩ to set the divider current at the required value.\nCalculate the value of resistor R3, as a function of the needed output voltage (V NEG), with Equation 2 :\nNEG\nrefVR3 R4V§ ·  \x10 u¨ ¸ \n© ¹ \n(2)\nIn this example, with R4 = 121.2 kΩ, choose R3 = 1 MΩ to set V NEG = –10 V.\n8.2.2.2 Inductor Selection\nAn inductive converter normally requires two main passive components for storing energy during the conversion. \nTherefore, each converter requires an inductor and a storage capacitor. In selecting the right inductor, TI \nrecommends keeping the possible peak inductor current below the current limit threshold of the power switch \nin the chosen configuration. For example, the current limit threshold of the switch for the boost converter and \nfor the inverting converters is nominally 800 mA for the TPS65130 device and 1950 mA for TPS65131 device. \nThe highest peak current through the switches and the inductor depend on the output load, the input voltage \n(VIN), and the output voltages (V POS, VNEG). Use Equation 3  to estimate the peak inductor current in the boost \nconverter, I L_P. Equation 4  shows the corresponding formula for the inverting converter, I L_N.\nPOS\n(L P) POS\nIVI I V 0.64\x10 u u\n(3)\nI NEG\n(L N) NEG\nIV V I I V 0.64\x10\x10 u u\n(4)\nThe second parameter for choosing the inductor is the desired current ripple in the inductor. Normally, it is \nadvisable to work with a ripple of less than 20% of the average inductor current. A smaller ripple reduces \nthe losses in the inductor, as well as output voltage ripple and EMI. But in the same way, output voltage \nregulation gets slower, causing greater voltage changes at fast load changes. In addition, a larger inductor \nusually increases the total system cost. Keep those parameters in mind and calculate the possible inductor value \nwith Equation 5  for the boost converter and Equation 6  for the inverting converter.\n\x0b \x0cI POS I\n(L P) POSV V VL1I f V\x10u \x10  \' u u\n(5)\n\x0b \x0cI NEG\n(L N) NEG IV V L2I f V V\x10u \' u u \x10\n(6)\nParameter f is the switching frequency. For the boost converter, ΔIL-P is the ripple current in the inductor, that is, \n20% of I L-P. Accordingly, for the inverting converter, ΔIL-N is the ripple current in the inductor, that is, 20% of I L-N. \nVI is the input voltage, which is 3.3 V in this example. So, the calculated inductance value for the boost inductor www.ti.comTPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\nis 5.1 μH and for the inverting converter inductor is 5.1 μH. With these calculated values and the calculated \ncurrents, it is possible to choose a suitable inductor.\nIn typical applications, the recommendation is to choose a 4.7- μH inductor. The device is optimized to work \nwith inductance values from 3.3 μH to 6.8 μH. Nevertheless, operation with greater inductance values may be \npossible in some applications. Perform detailed stability analysis in this case. Be aware of the possibility that \nload transients and losses in the circuit can lead to higher currents than estimated in Equation 3  and Equation 4 . \nAlso, the losses caused by magnetic hysteresis and conductor resistance are a major parameter for total circuit \nefficiency.\nTable 8-3  shows inductors from different suppliers used with the TPS65130/1 converter:\nTable 8-3. List of Inductors\nVENDOR(1)INDUCTOR SERIES\nEPCOS B8246284-G4\nWurth Elektronik7447789XXX\n744031XXX\nTDKVLF3010\nVLF4012\nCooper Electronics Technologies SD12\n(1) See Third-party Products Disclaimer\n8.2.2.3 Capacitor Selection\n8.2.2.3.1 Input Capacitor\nAs a recommendation, choose an input capacitors of at least 4.7 μF for the input of the boost converter (INP) \nand accordingly for the input of the inverting converter (INN). This improves transient behavior of the regulators \nand EMI behavior of the total power-supply circuit. Choose a ceramic capacitor or a tantalum capacitor. For the \nuse of a tantalum capacitor, an additional, smaller ceramic capacitor (100 nF) in parallel is required. Place the \ninput capacitor(s) close to the input pins..\n8.2.2.3.2 Output Capacitors\nOne of the major parameters necessary to define the capacitance value of the output capacitor is the maximum \nallowed output voltage ripple of the converter. This ripple is determined by two parameters of the capacitor, the \ncapacitance and the ESR. It is possible to calculate the minimum capacitance needed for the defined ripple, \nsupposing that the ESR is zero. Use Equation 7  for the boost converter output capacitor (C4min) and Equation 8 \nfor the inverting converter output capacitor (C5min).\n\x0b \x0c POS POS I\nPOS POSI V VC4minf V Vu \x10  u\' u\n(7)\n\x0b \x0cNEG NEG\nNEG NEG II V C5minf V V Vu u\' u \x10\n(8)\nThe parameter f is the switching frequency. ΔVPOS and ΔV NEG are the maximum allowed ripple voltages for each \nconverter. Choosing a ripple voltage in the range of 10 mV requires a minimum capacitance of 12 μF. The total \nripple is larger due to the ESR of the output capacitor. Use Equation 9  for he boost converter and Equation 10  for \nthe inverting converter to calculate this additional ripple component.\n(ESR P) POS (ESR C4)V I R\x10 \x10 \'  u\n(9)\n(ESR N) NEG (ESR C5)V I R\x10 \x10 \'  u\n(10)TPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\nIn this example, an additional ripple of 2 mV is the result of using a typical ceramic capacitor with an ESR in the \n10-mΩ  range. The total ripple is the sum of the ripple caused by the capacitance and the ripple caused by the \nESR of the capacitor. In this example, the total ripple is 10 mV.\nLoad transients can create additional ripple. When the load current increases rapidly, the output capacitor must \nprovide the additional current until the inductor current increases by the control loop which sets a higher ON-time \n(duty cycle) of the main switch. The higher duty cycle results in longer inductor charging periods. The inductance \nitself also limits the rate of increase of the inductor current. When the load current decreases rapidly, the \noutput capacitor must store the excess energy (stored in the inductor) until the regulator has decreased the \ninductor current by reducing the duty cycle. TI recommends using greater capacitance values, as the foregoing \ncalculations show.\n8.2.2.4 Rectifier Diode Selection\nBoth converters (the boost and inverting converter) require rectifier diodes, D1 and D2. As a recommendation, to \nreduce losses, use Schottky diodes. The forward current rating needed is equal to the maximum output current. \nConsider that the maximum currents, I POSmax and I NEGmax, might differ for V POS and V NEG when choosing the \ndiodes.\n8.2.2.5 External PMOS Selection\nDuring shutdown, when connected to a power supply, a path from the power supply to the positive output \nconducts through the inductor and an external diode. Optionally, to fully disconnect the positive output V POS \nduring shutdown, add an external PMOS (Q1). The BSW pin controls the gate of the PMOS. When choosing a \nproper PMOS, the V GS and V GD voltage ratings must cover the input voltage range, the drain current rating must \nnot be lower than the maximum input current flowing into the application, and conditions of the PMOS operating \narea must fit.\nIf there is no intention to use an external PMOS, leave the BSW pin floating.\n8.2.2.6 Stabilizing the Control Loop\n8.2.2.6.1 Feedforward Capacitor\nAs a recommendation, to speed up the control loop, place feedforward capacitors in the feedback divider, \nparallel to R1 (boost converter) and R3 (inverting converter). Equation 11  shows how to calculate the appropriate \nvalue for the boost converter, and Equation 12  for the inverting converter.\n6.8 \x1dVC9R1 \n(11)\n7.5 \x1dVC10R3 \n(12)\nTo avoid coupling noise into the control loop from the feedforward capacitors, the feedforward effect can be \nbandwidth-limited by adding a series resistor. Any value from 10 k Ω to 100 k Ω is suitable. The greater the \nresistance, the lower the noise coupled into the control loop system.\n8.2.2.6.2 Compensation Capacitors\nThe device features completely internally compensated control loops for both converters. The internal \nfeedforward system has built-in error correction which requires external capacitors. As a recommendation, use \na 10-nF capacitor at the CP pin of the boost converter and a 4.7-nF capacitor at the CN pin of the inverting \nconverter.\n8.2.3 Analog Supply Filter\nTo ensure a noise free voltage supply of the IC, it is recommended to add an RC or LC filter between INN and \nVIN pins.www.ti.comTPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\n8.2.3.1 RC-Filter\nFor most applications an RC filter can be used with a resistance value of 100 Ω minimum and capacitor value of \n0.1 µF as in the application example Figure 8-1 .\n8.2.3.2 LC-Filter\nFor applications where input voltages V I with a fast rising edge (slew rate ≥ 275 mV/µs) are expected, it is \nrecommended to replace the resistor R7 with a ferrite bead to minimize the delay between the signals on the \nINN pin and VIN pin. Select a ferrite bead with the lowest possible DCR and a proper current rating, such as \nBLM18KG101TN1 for example. A conservative approach for the current rating specification is to set it at 1.5 \ntimes or twice the maximum input current.\nTable 8-4.

Consequently, the supply can come, for \nexample, from a 3.3-V or 5-V rail. If the device starts into load during the soft-start phase, the drawn input \ncurrent can be higher than during post-start operation. Consider the application requirements when selecting \nthe power supply. To avoid unintended toggling of the undervoltage lockout protection, connect the TPS6513x \ndevice through a low-impedance path to the power supply.www.ti.comTPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\n9 Layout\n9.1 Layout Guidelines\nAs for all switching power supplies, the layout is an important step in the design, especially at high peak currents \nand high switching frequencies. Improper layout might show the symptoms of poor line or load regulation, \nground and output voltage shifts, stability issues, unsatisfying EMI behavior or worsened efficiency. Therefore, \nuse wide and short traces for the main current paths and for the power ground tracks. The input capacitors \n(C1, C2, C3), output capacitors (C4, C5), the inductors (L1, L2), and the rectifying diodes (D1, D2) should be \nplaced as close as possible to the IC to keep parasitic inductances low. Use a wide power ground (PGND) plane. \nConnect the analog ground pin (AGND) to the PGND plane. Further, connect the PGND plane with the exposed \nthermal pad. Place the feedback dividers as close as possible to the control pin (boost converter) or the VREF \npin (inverting converter) of the IC.\n9.2 Layout Example\nC7\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n2412\n11\n10\n9\n8\n718\n17\n16\n15\n14131\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nVNEG\nVPOSPGND\nVIC6R3 R4 C8\nD2L2\nU1R2 R1 C9\nD1\nL1C4\nR7\nC3\nC2\nC1Q1PGNDPGNDINP\nPGNDPSNNC\nENN\nPSP\nENP\nBSWPGND\nVIN\nINNINN OUTNOUTNVNEGFBNVREFCN\nAGND\nNC\nCP\nFBP\nVPOS\nINP\nC5C10\nFigure 9-1. Layout Recommendation (TPS65130 and TPS65131)\n9.3 Thermal Considerations\nImplementation of integrated circuits in low-profile and fine-pitch surface-mount packages typically requires \nspecial attention to power dissipation. Many system-dependent issues, such as thermal coupling, airflow, \nadded heatsinks and convection surfaces, and the presence of heat-generating components affect the power-\ndissipation limits of a given component.\nThese three basic approaches enhance thermal performance:\n•Improving the power dissipation capability of the PCB design.\n•Improving the thermal coupling of the component to the PCB.\n•Introducing airflow to the system.TPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\nThe recommended device junction temperature range, T J, is –40°C to 125°C. The thermal resistance of the 24-\npin QFN, 4–mm × 4–mm package (RGE) is R θJA = 34.1°C/W. The recommended operating ambient temperature \nrange for the device is T A = –40°C to 85°C. Use Equation 13  to calculate the maximum power dissipation, \nPDmax, as a function of T A. In this equation, use T J = 125°C to operate the device within the recommended \ntemperature range, use T J = T TS to determine the absolute maximum threshold when the device might go into \nthermal shutdown. If the maximum ambient temperature of the application is lower, more heat dissipation is \npossible.\nJ A \nD\nJAT T P maxRT\x10 \n(13)www.ti.comTPS65130, TPS65131\nSLVS493E – MARCH 2004 – REVISED APRIL 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: TPS65130  TPS65131\n10 Device and Documentation Support\n10.1 Device Support\n10.2 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
