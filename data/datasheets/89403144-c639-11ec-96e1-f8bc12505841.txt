\nflyback SMPS solutions up to 30W  output . With \nbuilt-in frequency hopping and frequency \njittering  functions, it can effectively reduce \nstandby power consumption, improve overall \nsystem EMI performance, and meet EU Class \nVI energy efficienc y standards.  \n \n1. Start up  \nDK22 XMP/DK22 XMD has very low start -up \ncurrent and a built -in high -voltage start -up \ncircuit to meet start -up requirements while reducing losses. For most AC -DC solutions, \nwith the right V DD capacitor, the overall  system \ncan quickly start up within full voltage range \n(85VAC - 265V AC). The DK22 XMP/DK22 XMD \nhas a typical operating current of about \n0.83mA . With unique frequency hopping mode \nit can  improve overall efficiency  easily . \n \n2. Soft start  \nThe DK22 XMP/DK22 XMD has a built -in \n2mS soft -start circuit that buffers the switching \nstress on the MOSFETs during circuit startup. \nOnce the V DD voltage reaches UVLO(OFF) the \nsoft-start is activated and the peak current limit \n DK22xMP/DK22xMD  \n-------- ------------------------------------------ CONFIDENTIAL ------------------------------------  VER 2. 1A 6 \nDK SEMICONDUCTOR Wuxi CO., LTD JUN.2021 \nvoltage gradually reaches 0.8 V from 0. Each \nrestart follows the occurrence of a soft -start.  \n \n3. Frequency jitter ing  \nDK22 XMP/DK22 XMD series has a built -in \nfrequency jittering function that can effectively \nimprove the EMI characteristics of the system \nand simplify the circuit design.  \n \n4. Frequency hopping  \nDuring  no load or light load  condition , \nmost of t he losses in the system are made up \nof the switching losses of the MOSFET, the \ncore losses of the transformer and the losses \nin the buffer network. The largest loss comes \nfrom the switching losses, so reducing the \nswitching frequency of the system can \neffectively reduce the losses.  \nDuring normal operation, the frequency is \nregulated by the loop and the IC. During  no \nload or light load  condition , the switching \nfrequency will be reduced to improve \nefficiency . When the FB voltage drops below \n1.2V, the IC will enter frequency hopping \nmode. In frequency hopping mode, the gate \ndriver of the IC will work only when V DD voltage \nis lower than the pre -set level or the FB voltage \nis higher than 1.2V, otherwise the gate driver \ncircuit will remain off to reduce the switching \nloss and reduce the standby power \nconsumption. The frequency of frequency \nhopping is set outside the audio range to \nensure no audio n oise during operation.  \n  \n5. Oscillation frequency   \nThe DK22 XMP/DK22 XMD has the max \nswitching frequency of 65KHz and requires no \nperipheral circuitry for setup.   \n \n6. Current sampling and leading edge \nblanking   \nThe DK22 XMP/DK22 XMD uses current \nmode PWM and variab le frequency PFM control to provide cycle -by-cycle current limit protection. \nThe power MOSFET  current is detected by a \nsampling resistor connected to the CS pin. \nWhen the internal power MOSFET  is just turned \non, the reverse recovery current of the diode in \nthe buffer network and the discharge current of \nthe power MOSFET  drain capacitor cause a \nhigh voltage spike on the sampling resistor, \nwhich causes the chip to misjudge the current . \nDK22 XMP/DK22 XMD has a 400ns fading time \non the CS pin to shield the chip from this spike, \nso there is no need for an RC filter network \noutside the CS pin. During the LEB time, the \ncurrent limit comparator does not work and \ncannot turn off the power  MOSFET . The PWM \nduty cycle of the chip is determined by the \nvoltage on the sampling resistor together with \nthe voltage on the FB.   \n \n7. Slope compensation   \nThe DK22 XMP/DK22 XMD pr ovides ramp \ncompensation to superimposes the sawtooth  \nvoltage  signal on the sampled current signal. \nWhen the chip operates in CCM mode, \nespecially when the duty cycle is larger than \n50%, it avoids subharmonic oscillations in the \nloop.  \n \n8. Power  MOSFET  driver  \nThe DK22 XMP/DK22 XMD adopts a unique \ndrive technology. If the driving capa bility is too \nweak, it will introduce more  switching losses . If \nthe driving  capability is  too strong , it will lead  to \nEMI problems. DK22 XMP/DK22 XMD adopts an \noptimized totem pole structure to obtain better \nEMI characteristics and lower losses through \nsuitable  output drive capability and dead time.  \n \n9. Protective function   \nDK22 XMP/DK22 XMD has comprehensive \nprotection functions, including cycle -by-cycle  \ncurrent limit protection (OCP), over load \nprotection (OLP), over temperature protection \n DK22xMP/DK22xMD  \n-------- ------------------------------------------ CONFIDENTIAL ------------------------------------  VER 2. 1A 7 \nDK SEMICONDUCTOR Wuxi CO., LTD JUN.2021 \n(OTP), V DD over voltage protection, under \nvoltage protection (UVLO) and output Schottky \nabnormal  protection.  \nDK22 XMP/DK22 XMD has a built -in current \nlimit point compen sation function  over different \ninput voltage  to ensure the circuit has a constant \nover current limit point over the entire  operating \nvoltage range (85V AC-265V AC), which also \nensures constant power.  \nWhen overload or output short circuit \noccurs, the FB voltage will exceed V TH_PL \n(overload protection threshold). When V DD \nvoltage is lower than V uvlo(ON) , the chip's \noverload protection circuit starts to work, the \nchip turns off the power  MOSFET and after \ndelaying T stop, the circuit can resume normal operati on only after entering the end of V DD \nrestart.  \nWhen the circuit starts, the transformer \nauxiliary winding provides energy to the V DD \ncapacitor. When the VDD voltage exceeds V OVP, \nthe overvoltage protection circuit works, the \nchip turns off the power  MOSFET  and after \ndelaying T stop, the circuit can resume normal \noperation only after entering the need of V DD \nrestart.  \nWhen the FB voltage falls below V TH_PL and \nthe V DD voltage drops below V UVLO, the chip ’s \nundervoltage protection (UVLO) circuit works to \nshut down the chip . The chip will restart to work \nonly after V DD finishes restart.\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n DK22xMP/DK22xMD  \n-------- ------------------------------------------ CONFIDENTIAL ------------------------------------  VER 2. 1A 8 \nDK SEMICONDUCTOR Wuxi CO., LTD JUN.2021 \n \n◼ SOP -8 PACKAGE OUTLINE DIMENSIONS  \n \n \n \nSymbol  Dimensions In Milimeters  \nMin Max \nA 1.35 1.75 \nA1 0.10 0.25 \nA2 1.25 1.65 \nA3 0.50 0.70 \nb 0.38 0.51 \nb1 0.37 0.47 \nc 0.17 0.25 \nc1 0.17 0.23 \nD 4.70 5.10 \nE 5.80 6.20 \nE1 3.80 4.00 \nL 0.45 0.80 \nL1 1.04REF  \nL2 0.25BSC  \ne 1.270(BSC)  \nθ 0° 8° \n \n \n \n \n \n\n DK22xMP/DK22xMD  \n-------- ------------------------------------------ CONFIDENTIAL ------------------------------------  VER 2. 1A 9 \nDK SEMICONDUCTOR Wuxi CO., LTD JUN.2021 \n \n◼ DIP-8 PACKAGE OUTLINE DIMENSIONS  \n \nSymbol  Dimensions In Millimeters  Dimensions In Inches  \nMin Max Min Max \nA 3.710  4.310  0.146  0.170  \nA1 0.510   0.020   \nA2 3.200  3.600  0.126  0.142  \nB 0.380  0.570  0.015  0.022  \nB1 1.524(BSC)  0.060(BSC)  \nC 0.204  0.360  0.008  0.014  \nD 9.000  9.400  0.354  0.370  \nE 6.200  6.600  0.244  0.260  \nE1 7.320  7.920  0.288  0.312  \ne 2.540(BSC)  0.100(BSC)  \nL 3.000  3.600  0.118  0.142  \nE2 8.400  9.200  0.331  0.354  \n \n \n\n"}]
