Built using a CBCMOS process,these m onolithic DACs offer the user low cost, and ease-of-use\nin single-supply 3 V systems. Operation is guaranteed over thesupply voltage range of 2.7 V to 5.5 V consuming less than 100 µA\nmaking this device ideal for battery operated applications.The  full-scale voltage output is determined by the externalreference input voltage applied. The rail-to-rail REF\nIN to\nDAC OUT allows for a full-scale voltage set equal to the positive\nsupply V DD or any value in between.\nA doubled-buffered serial-data interface offers high-speed,3-wire, SPI and microcontroller compatible inputs using datain (SDI), clock (CLK) and load strobe ( LD) pins. Addition-\nally, a CLR  input sets the output to zero scale at power on or\nupon user demand.Both parts are offered in the same pinout to allow users to selectthe amount of resolution appropriate for their application withoutcircuit card redesign.The AD7390/AD7391 are specified over the extended industrial(/H1100240°C to /H1100185°C) temperature range. The AD7391AR is\nspecified for the /H1100240°C to /H11001125°C automotive temperature\nrange. The AD7390/AD7391s are available in plastic DIP, andlow profile 1.75 mm height SO-8 surface mount packages. TheAD7391ARU is available for ultracompact applications in a thin1.1 mm TSSOP-8 package.\nCODE – Decimal1.00\n/H115461.00\n0 4096 512DNL – LSB\n1024 1536 2048 2560 3072 35840.75\n/H115460.00\n/H115460.25\n/H115460.50\n/H115460.750.500.25 AD7390\nVDD = 3.0V\nTA = /H1154655/H11543C, +25 /H11543C, +85 /H11543C\n SUPERIMPOSED\nFigure 1.

These single-supply opera-\ntion devices consume less than 100 microamps of current while\noperating from power supplies in the 2.7 V to 5.5 V range mak-ing them ideal for battery operated applications. They contain a\nvoltage-switched, 12-bit/10-bit, laser-trimmed digital-to-analog\nconverter, rail-to-rail output op amps, serial-input register, anda DAC register. The external reference input has constant input\nresistance independent of the digital code setting of the DAC.\nIn addition, the reference input can be tied to the same supply\nvoltage as V DD resulting in a maximum output voltage span of\n0 to V DD. The SPI compatible, serial-data interface consists of\na serial data input (SDI), clock (CLK), and load ( LD) pins.\nA CLR  pin is available to reset the DAC register to zero-scale.\nThis function is useful for power-on reset or system failure\nrecovery to a known state.\nD/A CONVERTER SECTION\nThe voltage switched R-2R DAC generates an output voltagedependent on the external reference voltage connected to the\nV\nREF pin according to the following equation:\n    VVD\nOUT REFN=×\n2(1)\nwhere D is the decimal data word loaded into the DAC register,\nand N is the number of bits of DAC resolution. In the case of the\n10-bit AD7391 using a 2.5 V reference, Equation 1 sim plifies to:\n    VD\nOUT =×251024. (2)\nUsing Equation 2 the nominal midscale voltage at VOUT is\n1.25 V for D = 512; full-scale voltage is 2.497 V. The LSB step\nsize is = 2.5 /H11003 1/1024 = 0.0024 V.\nFor the 12-bit AD7390 operating from a 5.0 V reference\nEquation 1 becomes:\n    VD\nOUT =×504096. (3)\nUsing Equation 3 the AD7390 provides a nominal midscale\nvoltage of 2.5 V for D = 2048, and a full-scale output of 4.998 V.\nThe LSB step size is = 5.0 /H11003 1/4096 = 0.0012 V.\nAMPLIFIER SECTION\nThe internal DAC ’s output is buffered by a low power con-\nsumption precision amplifier. The op amp has a 60 µs typical\nsettling time to 0.1% of full scale. There are slight differences in\nsettling time for negative slewing signals versus positive. Also,\nnegative transition settling time to within the last 6 LSBs of zerovolts has an extended settling time. The rail-to-rail output stage\nof this amplifier has been designed to provide precision perfor-\nmance while operating near either power supply. Figure 5shows an equivalent output schematic of the rail-to-rail ampli-\nfier with its N-channel pull-down FETs that will pull an output\nload directly to GND. The output sourcing current is providedby a P-channel pull-up device that can source current to GND\nterminated loads.AGNDVOUTVDD\nP-CH\nN-CH\nFigure 5. Equivalent Analog Output Circuit\nThe rail-to-rail output stage provides ±1 mA of output current.\nThe N-channel output pull-down MOSFET shown in Figure 5has a 35 Ω ON resistance, which sets the sink current capability\nnear ground. In addition to resistive load driving capability, the\namplifier has also been carefully designed and characterized forup to 100 pF capacitive load driving capability.\nREFERENCE INPUT\nThe reference input terminal has a constant input-resistance\nindependent of digital code which results in reduced glitches on\nthe external reference voltage source. The high 2 M Ω input-\nresistance minimizes power dissipation within the AD7390/\nAD7391 D/A converters. The V REF input accepts input voltages\nranging from ground to the positive-supply voltage V DD. One of\nthe simplest applications which saves an external reference\nvoltage source is connection of the V REF terminal to the positive\nVDD supply. This connection results in a rail-to-rail voltage\noutput span maximizing the programmed range.  The reference\ninput will accept ac signals as long as they are kept within the\nsupply voltage range, 0 < V REF IN  < V DD. The reference band-\nwidth and integral nonlinearity error performance are plotted in\nthe typical performance section (see TPCs 14 and 15). The\nratiometric reference feature makes the AD7390/AD7391 anideal companion to ratiometric analog-to-digital converters such\nas the AD7896.\nPOWER SUPPLY\nThe very low power consumption of the AD7390/AD7391 is a\ndirect result of a circuit design optimizing the use of a CBCMOSprocess. By using the low power characteristics of CMOS for the\nlogic, and the low noise, tight-matching of the complementary\nbipolar transistors, excellent analog accuracy is achieved. Oneadvantage of the rail-to-rail output amplifiers used in the AD7390/\nAD7391 is the wide range of usable supply voltage. The part is\nfully specified and tested for operation from 2.7 V to 5.5 V.\nPOWER SUPPLY BYPASSING AND GROUNDING\nPrecision analog products, such as the AD7390/AD7391, requirea well filtered power source. Since the AD7390/AD7391 operates\nfrom a single 3 V to 5 V supply, it seems convenient to simply tap\ninto the digital logic power supply. Unfortunately, the logic sup-ply is often a switch-mode design, which generates noise in the\n20 kHz to 1 MHz range. In addition, fast logic gates can generate\nglitches hundred of millivolts in amplitude due to wiring resis-tance and inductance. The power supply noise generated thereby\nmeans that special care must be taken to assure that the inherent\nprecision of the DAC is maintained. Good engineering judgmentshould be exercised when addressing the power supply ground-\ning and bypassing of the AD7390.\nREV. AAD7390/AD7391\n–9–The AD7390 should be powered directly from the system\npower supply. This arrangement, shown in Figure 6, employs anLC filter and separate power and ground connections to isolate\nthe analog section from the logic switching transients.\nFERRITE BEAD:\nTWO TURNS, FAIR-RITE#2677006301TTL/CMOS\nLOGIC\nCIRCUITS\n5V\nPOWER SUPPL Y100/H9262F\nELECT.10/H9262F–22/H9262F\nTANTALUM0.1/H9262F\nCERAMICCAP ACITOR5V\n5V\nRETURN\nFigure 6.

Recommended Supply Bypassing\nINPUT LOGIC LEVELS\nAll digital inputs are protected with a Zener-type ESD protection\nstructure (Figure 8) that allows logic input voltages to exceed theV\nDD supply voltage. This feature can be useful if the user is driving\none or more of the digital inputs with a 5 V CMOS logic input-\nvoltage level while operating the AD7390/AD7391 on a 3 V powersupply. If this mode of interface is used, make sure that the V\nOL\nof the 5 V CMOS meets the V IL input requirement of the AD7390/\nAD7391 operating at 3 V. See TPC 6 for a graph for digitallogic input threshold versus operating V\nDD supply voltage.\nLOGIC\nINVDD\nGND\nFigure 8. Equivalent Digital Input ESD Protection\nIn order to minimize power dissipation from input-logic levels that\nare near the V IH and V IL logic input voltage specifications, a\nSchmitt trigger design was used that minimizes the input-buffer\ncurrent consumption compared to traditional CMOS input\nstages. TPC 5 shows a plot of incremental input voltage versussupply current showing that negligible current consumption\ntakes place when logic levels are in their quiescent state. Thenormal crossover current still occurs during logic transitions. A\nsecondary advantage of this Schmitt trigger is the prevention of\nfalse triggers that would occur with slow moving logic transi-tions when a standard CMOS logic interface or opto isolators\nare used. The logic inputs SDI, CLK, LD, CLR  all contain the\nSchmitt trigger circuits.\nDIGITAL INTERFACE\nThe AD7390/AD7391 have a double-buffered serial data input.The serial-input register is separate from the DAC register,\nwhich allows preloading of a new data value into the serial regis-\nter without disturbing the present DAC values. A functionalblock diagram of the digital section is shown in Figure 4, while\nTable I contains the truth table for the control logic inputs.\nThree pins control the serial data input. Data at the Serial DataInput (SDI) is clocked into the shift register on the rising edge\nof CLK. Data is entered in MSB-first format. Twelve clock\npulses are required to load the 12-bit AD7390 DAC value. Ifadditional bits are clocked into the shift register, for example\nwhen a microcontroller sends two 8-bit bytes, the MSBs are\nignored (Figure 9). The CLK pin is only enabled when Load(LD) is high. The lower resolution 10-bit AD7391 contains a\n10-bit shift register. The AD7391 is also loaded MSB first with\n10 bits of data. Again if additional bits are clocked into the shiftregister, only the last 10 bits clocked in are used.\nThe Load pin ( LD) controls the flow of data from the shift\nregister to the DAC register. After a new value is clocked into\nthe serial-input register, it will be transferred to the DAC registerby the negative transition of the Load pin ( LD).\nBYTE 1 BYTE 0\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nB15 B14 B13 B12 B11 B10 B9 B8 B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0\nX X X X D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nX X X X X X D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nD11–D0: 12-BIT AD7390 DAC VALUE;  D9 –D0: 10-BIT AD7391 DAC VALUE\nX = DON ’T CARE\nTHE MSB OF BYTE 1 IS THE FIRST BIT THAT IS LOADED INTO THE DAC\nFigure 9. Typical AD7390-Microprocessor Serial Data\nInput Forms\nRESET ( CLR ) PIN\nForcing the CLR  pin low will set the DAC register to all zeros\nand the DAC output voltage will be zero volts. The reset function\nis useful for setting the DAC outputs to zero at power-up or\nafter a power supply interruption. Test systems and motorcontrollers are two of many applications which benefit from\npowering up to a known state. The external reset pulse can be\ngenerated by the microprocessor ’s power-on RESET signal, by\nan output from the microprocessor, or by an external resistor\nand capacitor.  CLR  has a Schmitt trigger input which results in\na clean reset function when using external resistor/capacitorgenerated pulses. The CLR  input overrides other logic inputs,\nspecifically LD. However, LD should be set high before CLR\ngoes high. If CLR  is kept low, then the contents of the shift\nregister will be transferred to the DAC register as soon as CLR\nreturns high. See the Control-Logic Truth Table I.\nREV. AAD7390/AD7391\n–10–UNIPOLAR OUTPUT OPERATION\nThis is the basic mode of operation for the AD7390. As shown\nin Figure 10, the AD7390 has been designed to drive loads as\nlow as 5 k Ω in parallel with 100 pF. The code table for this\noperation is shown in Table IV.\nAD73900.1/H9262F\nCLK\nVOUTREF VDD\nGNDR\n10/H9262F\n67\n5123\n4SDI\nCLRLD2.7V TO 5.5V\nRL\n 5k/H9024CL\n 100pF/H9262C\nRSEXT\nREF0.01 /H9262F\nFigure 10.

This circuit uses a clean\nregulated 5 V supply for power, which also provides the circuit ’s\nreference voltage. Since the AD7391 output span swings fromground to very near 5 V, it is necessary to choose an external\namplifier with a common-mode input voltage range that extends\nto its positive supply rail. The micropower consumption OP196 hasbeen designed just for this purpose and results in only 50 micro-\namps of maximum current consumption. Connection of the equally\nvalued 470 k Ω resistors results in a differential amplifier mode\nof operation with a voltage gain of two, which results in a circuit\noutput span of ten volts, that is, 25 V to 15 V. As the DAC is\nprogrammed with zero-code 000\nH to midscale 200 H to full-scale\n3FF H, the circuit output voltage V O is set at 25 V, 0 V and 15 V\n(minus 1 LSB). The output voltage V O is coded in offset binary\naccording to Equation 4.\n    VD\nO=\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n\uf8fa×51215– (4)\nwhere D is the decimal code loaded in the AD7391 DAC register.\nNote that the LSB step size is 10/1024 = 10 mV. This circuit has\nbeen optimized for micropower consumption including the 470 k Ωgain setting resistors, which should have low temperature coeffi-\ncients to maintain accuracy and matching (preferably the samematerial, such as metal film). If better stability is required, the power\nsupply could be substituted with a precision reference voltage such\nas the low dropout REF195, which can easily supply the circuit ’s\n162 µA of current, and still provide additional power for the\nload connected to V\nO. The micropower REF195 is guaranteed\nto source 10 mA output drive current, but only consumes 50 µA\ninternally. If higher resolution is required, the AD7390 can be\nused with the addition of two more bits of data inserted into the\nsoftware coding, which would result in a 2.5 mV LSB step size.Table V shows examples of nominal output voltages V\nO provided\nby the Bipolar Operation circuit application.\nCISY < 162 /H9262A\nBIPOLAR\nOUTPUTSWING VO+5V\n–5V\n–5VVOUT AD7391VDD REF\nGND+5V\n< 100 /H9262A470k /H9024 470k /H9024\n< 50 /H9262A\nOP196\nDIGITAL INTERFACE CIRCUITRY OMITTED FOR CLARITY\nFigure 11.

Many µCs have a\nbuilt-in serial data capability which can be used for communi-cating with the DAC. In cases where no serial port is provided,\nor it is being used for some other purpose (such as an RS-232\ncommunications interface), the AD7390/AD7391 can easily beaddressed in software.\nTwelve data bits are required to load a value into the AD7390.\nIf more than 12 bits are transmitted before the load LD input\ngoes high, the extra (i.e., the most-significant) bits are ignored.This feature is valuable because most µCs only transmit data\nin 8-bit increments. Thus, the µC sends 16 bits to the DAC\ninstead of 12 bits. The AD7390 will only respond to the last12 bits clocked into the SDI input, however, so the serial-data\ninterface is not affected.\nTen data bits are required to load a value into the AD7391. If\nmore than 10 bits are transmitted before load LD returns high,\nthe extra bits are ignored.\nREV.
