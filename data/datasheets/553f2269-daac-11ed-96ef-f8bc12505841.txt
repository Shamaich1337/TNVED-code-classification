The exposed pad on this package can be connected to GND or left floating.\n2. For use of the WLCSP package, refer to Device Addressing  for details about setting the A2, A1 and\nA0 hardware address bits.\n3. If the A0, A1, A2 or WP pins are not driven, they are internally pulled down to GND. In order to\noperate in a wide variety of application environments, the pull ‑down mechanism is intentionally\ndesigned to be somewhat strong. Once these pins are biased above the CMOS input buffer’s trip\npoint (~0.5 x V CC), the pull ‑down mechanism disengages. Microchip recommends connecting these\npins to a known state whenever possible.\n2.1 Device Address Inputs (A0, A1, A2)\nThe A0, A1 and A2 pins are device address inputs that are hard-wired (directly to GND or to V CC) for\ncompatibility with other two-wire Serial EEPROM devices. When the pins are hard-wired, as many as\neight devices may be addressed on a single bus system. A device is selected when a corresponding\nhardware and software match is true. If these pins are left floating, the A0, A1 and A2 pins will be\ninternally pulled down to GND. However, due to capacitive coupling that may appear in customer\napplications, Microchip recommends always connecting the address pins to a known state. When using a\npull ‑up resistor, Microchip recommends using 10 kΩ or less.\n2.2 Ground\nThe ground reference for the power supply. GND should be connected to the system ground.\n2.3 Serial Data (SDA)\nThe SDA pin is an open-drain bidirectional input/output pin used to serially transfer data to and from the\ndevice. The SDA pin must be pulled high using an external pull-up resistor (not to exceed 10 kΩ in value)\nand may be wire-ORed with any number of other open-drain or open-collector pins from other devices on\nthe same bus. AT24C128C\nPin Descriptions\n© 2018 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006110A-page 5\n2.4 Serial Clock (SCL)\nThe SCL pin is used to provide a clock to the device and to control the flow of data to and from the\ndevice. Command and input data present on the SDA pin is always latched in on the rising edge of SCL,\nwhile output data on the SDA pin is clocked out on the falling edge of SCL. The SCL pin must either be\nforced high when the serial bus is idle or pulled high using an external pull-up resistor.\n2.5 Write-Protect (WP)\nThe write-protect input, when connected to GND, allows normal write operations. When the WP pin is\nconnected directly to V CC, all write operations to the protected memory are inhibited.\nIf the pin is left floating, the WP pin will be internally pulled down to GND. However, due to capacitive\ncoupling that may appear in customer applications, Microchip recommends always connecting the WP\npin to a known state. When using a pull ‑up resistor, Microchip recommends using 10 kΩ or less.\nTable 2-2.\u2000Write-Protect\nWP Pin Status Part of the Array Protected\nAt V CC Full Array\nAt GND Normal Write Operations\n2.6 Device Power Supply\nThe V CC pin is used to supply the source voltage to the device.

Upon power-up, the device will not\nrespond to any commands until the V CC level crosses the internal voltage threshold (V POR) that brings the\ndevice out of Reset and into Standby mode.\nThe system designer must ensure the instructions are not sent to the device until the V CC supply has\nreached a stable value greater than or equal to the minimum V CC level. Additionally, once the V CC is\ngreater than or equal to the minimum V CC level, the bus master must wait at least t PUP before sending the\nfirst command to the device. See Table 4-4  for the values associated with these power-up parameters.\nTable 4-4.\u2000Power-up Conditions(1)\nSymbol Parameter Min. Max.

Device Operation and Communication\nThe AT24C128C operates as a slave device and utilizes a simple I2C-compatible two-wire digital serial\ninterface to communicate with a host controller, commonly referred to as the bus master. The master\ninitiates and controls all read and write operations to the slave devices on the serial bus, and both the\nmaster and the slave devices can transmit and receive data on the bus.\nThe serial interface is comprised of just two signal lines: Serial Clock (SCL) and Serial Data (SDA).\nThe SCL pin is used to receive the clock signal from the master, while the bidirectional SDA pin is used to\nreceive command and data information from the master as well as to send data back to the master.\nData is always latched into the AT24C128C on the rising edge of SCL and always output from the device\non the falling edge of SCL. Both the SCL and SDA pin incorporate integrated spike suppression filters\nand Schmitt Triggers to minimize the effects of input spikes and bus noise.\nAll command and data information is transferred with the Most Significant bit (MSb) first. During bus\ncommunication, one data bit is transmitted every clock cycle, and after eight bits (one byte) of data have\nbeen transferred, the receiving device must respond with either an Acknowledge (ACK) or a\nNo-Acknowledge (NACK) response bit during a ninth clock cycle (ACK/NACK clock cycle) generated by\nthe master. Therefore, nine clock cycles are required for every one byte of data transferred. There are no\nunused clock cycles during any read or write operation, so there must not be any interruptions or breaks\nin the data stream during each data byte transfer and ACK or NACK clock cycle.\nDuring data transfers, data on the SDA pin must only change while SCL is low, and the data must remain\nstable while SCL is high. If data on the SDA pin changes while SCL is high, then either a Start or a Stop\ncondition will occur. Start and Stop conditions are used to initiate and end all serial bus communication\nbetween the master and the slave devices. The number of data bytes transferred between a Start and a\nStop condition is not limited and is determined by the master. In order for the serial bus to be idle, both\nthe SCL and SDA pins must be in the logic-high state at the same time.\n5.1 Clock and Data Transition Requirements\nThe SDA pin is an open-drain terminal and therefore, must be pulled high with an external pull ‑up\nresistor. SCL is an input pin that can either be driven high or pulled high using an external pull ‑up resistor.\nData on the SDA pin may change only during SCL low time periods. Data changes during SCL high\nperiods will indicate a Start or Stop condition as defined below. The relationship of the AC timing\nparameters with respect to SCL and SDA for the AT24C128C are shown in the timing waveform in Figure\n4-1. The AC timing characteristics and specifications are outlined in AC Characteristics .\n5.2 Start and Stop Conditions\n5.2.1 Start Condition\nA Start condition occurs when there is a high-to-low transition on the SDA pin while the SCL pin is at a\nstable logic ‘ 1’ state and will bring the device out of Standby mode. The master uses a Start condition to\ninitiate any data transfer sequence; therefore, every command must begin with a Start condition.\nThe device will continuously monitor the SDA and SCL pins for a Start condition but will not respond\nunless one is detected. Refer to Figure 5-1  for more details.\n5.2.2 Stop Condition\nA Stop condition occurs when there is a low-to-high transition on the SDA pin while the SCL pin is stable\nin the logic ‘ 1’ state. AT24C128C\nDevice Operation and Communication\n© 2018 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006110A-page 13\nThe master can use the Stop condition to end a data transfer sequence with the AT24C128C, which will\nsubsequently return to Standby mode. The master can also utilize a repeated Start condition instead of a\nStop condition to end the current data transfer if the master will perform another operation. Refer to \nFigure 5-1  for more details.\n5.3 Acknowledge and No-Acknowledge\nAfter every byte of data is received, the receiving device must confirm to the transmitting device that it\nhas successfully received the data byte by responding with what is known as an Acknowledge (ACK).\nAn ACK is accomplished by the transmitting device first releasing the SDA line at the falling edge of the\neighth clock cycle followed by the receiving device responding with a logic ‘ 0’ during the entire high period\nof the ninth clock cycle.\nWhen the AT24C128C is transmitting data to the master, the master can indicate that it is done receiving\ndata and wants to end the operation by sending a logic  ‘ 1’ response to the AT24C128C instead of an\nACK response during the ninth clock cycle. This is known as a No-Acknowledge (NACK) and is\naccomplished by the master sending a logic ‘ 1’ during the ninth clock cycle, at which point the\nAT24C128C will release the SDA line so the master can then generate a Stop condition.\nThe transmitting device, which can be the bus master or the Serial EEPROM, must release the SDA line\nat the falling edge of the eighth clock cycle to allow the receiving device to drive the SDA line to a logic ‘ 0’\nto ACK the previous 8-bit word. The receiving device must release the SDA line at the end of the ninth\nclock cycle to allow the transmitter to continue sending new data. A timing diagram has been provided in \nFigure 5-1  to better illustrate these requirements.\nFigure 5-1.\u2000Start Condition, Data Transitions, Stop Condition and Acknowledge\nSCL\nSDASDA\nMust Be\nStable\nSDA\nChange\nAllowedSDA\nChange\nAllowedAcknowledge\nValidStop\nCondition Start\nCondition1 2 8 9SDA\nMust Be\nStableAcknowledge Window\nThe transmitting device (Master or Slave) \nmust release the SDA line at this point to allow \nthe receiving device (Master or Slave) to drive the \nSDA line low to ACK the previous 8-bit word.The receiver (Master or Slave)\nmust release the SDA line at\nthis point to allow the transmitter \nto continue sending new data.\n5.4 Standby Mode\nThe AT24C128C features a low ‑power Standby mode that is enabled when any one of the following\noccurs:\n• A valid power-up sequence is performed (see Power-Up Requirements and Reset Behavior ).\n• A Stop condition is received by the device unless it initiates an internal write cycle (see Write\nOperations ).\n• At the completion of an internal write cycle (see Write Operations ).

Datasheet DS20006110A-page 14\n5.5 Software Reset\nAfter an interruption in protocol, power loss or system Reset, any two ‑wire device can be protocol reset\nby clocking SCL until SDA is released by the EEPROM and goes high. The number of clock cycles until\nSDA is released by the EEPROM will vary. The software Reset sequence should not take more than nine\ndummy clock cycles. Once the software Reset sequence is complete, new protocol can be sent to the\ndevice by sending a Start condition followed by the protocol. Refer to Figure 5-2  for an illustration.\nFigure 5-2.\u2000Software Reset\nSCL 9\nDevice is8 3 2 1\nSDADummy Clock Cycles\nSDA Released\nSoftware Reset by EEPROM\nIn the event that the device is still non-responsive or remains active on the SDA bus, a power cycle must\nbe used to reset the device (see Power-Up Requirements and Reset Behavior ).

Memory Organization\nThe AT24C128C is internally organized as 256 pages of 64 bytes each.\n6.1 Device Addressing\nAccessing the device requires an 8 ‑bit device address byte following a Start condition to enable the\ndevice for a read or write operation. Since multiple slave devices can reside on the serial bus, each slave\ndevice must have its own unique address so the master can access each device independently.\nThe Most Significant four bits of the device address byte is referred to as the device type identifier. The\ndevice type identifier ‘ 1010 ’ (Ah) is required in bits 7 through 4 of the device address byte (see \nTable 6 ‑1).\nFollowing the 4-bit device type identifier are the hardware slave address bits, A2, A1 and A0. These bits\ncan be used to expand the address space by allowing up to eight Serial EEPROM devices on the same\nbus. These hardware slave address bits must correlate with the voltage level on the corresponding\nhardwired device address input pins A0, A1 and A2. The A0, A1 and A2 pins use an internal proprietary\ncircuit that automatically biases the pin to a logic ‘ 0’ state if the pin is allowed to float. In order to operate\nin a wide variety of application environments, the pull ‑down mechanism is intentionally designed to be\nsomewhat strong. Once the pin is biased above the CMOS input buffer's trip point (~0.5 x V CC), the\npull ‑down mechanism disengages. Microchip recommends connecting the A0, A1 and A2 pins to a known\nstate whenever possible.\nWhen using the WLCSP package, the A2, A1 and A0 pins are not accessible. The A2 and A1 pins are left\nfloating, and the previously mentioned automatic pull-down circuit will set these pins to a logic ‘ 0’ state.\nThe A0 pin is internally connected to V CC. As a result, to properly communicate with the device in the\nWLCSP package, the A2 and A1 software bits must always be set to a logic ‘ 0’, and the A0 software bit\nmust be set to logic ‘ 1’ for any operation. Refer to Table 6-1  to review these bit positions.\nThe eighth bit (bit 0) of the device address byte is the Read/Write Select bit. A read operation is initiated if\nthis bit is high and a write operation is initiated if this bit is low.\nUpon the successful comparison of the device address byte, the AT24C128C will return an ACK. If a valid\ncomparison is not made, the device will NACK.\nTable 6-1.\u2000Device Address Byte\nPackage Device Type Identifier Hardware Slave Address Bits R/W Select\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\nSOIC, TSSOP, UDFN,\nVFBGA1 0 1 0 A2 A1 A0 R/W\nWLCSP 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 R/W\nFor all operations except the current address read, two 8 ‑bit word address bytes must be transmitted to\nthe device immediately following the device address byte. The word address bytes consist of the 14 ‑bit\nmemory array word address, and are used to specify which byte location in the EEPROM to start reading\nor writing.\nThe first word address byte contains the six Most Significant bits of the word address (A13 through A8) in\nbit positions five through zero, as seen in Table 6-2 .

Write Operations\nAll write operations for the AT24C128C begin with the master sending a Start condition, followed by a\ndevice address byte with the R/ W bit set to logic  ‘ 0’, and then by the word address bytes. The data\nvalue(s) to be written to the device immediately follow the word address bytes.\n7.1 Byte Write\nThe AT24C128C supports the writing of a single 8-bit byte. Selecting a data word in the AT24C128C\nrequires a 14-bit word address.\nUpon receipt of the proper device address and the word address bytes, the EEPROM will send an\nAcknowledge. The device will then be ready to receive the 8-bit data word. Following receipt of the 8 ‑bit\ndata word, the EEPROM will respond with an ACK. The addressing device, such as a bus master, must\nthen terminate the write operation with a Stop condition. At that time, the EEPROM will enter an internally\nself-timed write cycle, which will be completed within t WR, while the data word is being programmed into\nthe nonvolatile EEPROM. All inputs are disabled during this write cycle, and the EEPROM will not\nrespond until the write is complete.\nFigure 7-1.\u2000Byte Write\nSCL\nSDA\nStart Condition\nby MasterDevice Address Byte First Word Address Byte\nMSB MSB 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n 1  0  1 0 A2 A1 A0 0  0\nSecond Word Address Byte Data Word\nStop Condition\nby MasterMSB MSB 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 0 X X A13 A12 A11 A10 A9 A8 0\nACK\nfrom SlaveACK\nfrom Slave\nACK\nfrom SlaveACK\nfrom SlaveA7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 0\n7.2 Page Write\nA page write operation allows up to 64 bytes to be written in the same write cycle, provided all bytes are\nin the same row of the memory array (where address bits A13 through A6 are the same). Partial page\nwrites of less than 64 bytes are also allowed.\nA page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the bus master does not send a Stop condition\nafter the first data word is clocked in. Instead, after the EEPROM acknowledges receipt of the first data\nword, the bus master can transmit up to sixty three additional data words. The EEPROM will respond with\nan ACK after each data word is received. Once all data to be written has been sent to the device, the bus\nmaster must issue a Stop condition (see Figure 7-2 ) at which time the internally self-timed write cycle will\nbegin.\nThe lower six bits of the word address are internally incremented following the receipt of each data word.\nThe higher order address bits are not incremented and retain the memory page row location.

Datasheet DS20006110A-page 18\noperations are limited to writing bytes within a single physical page, regardless of the number of bytes\nactually being written. When the incremented word address reaches the page boundary, the address\ncounter will roll-over to the beginning of the same page. Nevertheless, creating a roll ‑over event should\nbe avoided as previously loaded data in the page could become unintentionally altered. \nFigure 7-2.\u2000 Page Write\nSCL\nSDA\nStart Condition\nby Master ACK\nfrom SlaveACK\nfrom SlaveDevice Address Byte  First Word Address Byte\nMSB MSB 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n 1  0  1 0 A2 A1 A0 0 0 X X A13 A12 A11  A10 A9 A8 0\nACK\nfrom SlaveACK\nfrom SlaveStop Condition\nby Master ACK\nfrom SlaveSecond Word Address Byte Data Word (n) Data Word (n+x), max of 64 without rollover 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n  A7   A6   A5   A4  A3  A2   A1  A0  0 D7  D6 D5  D4  D3 D2 D1 D0 0 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 0\nMSB MSB MSB\n7.3 Acknowledge Polling\nAn Acknowledge Polling routine can be implemented to optimize time-sensitive applications that would\nprefer not to wait the fixed maximum write cycle time (t WR). This method allows the application to know\nimmediately when the Serial EEPROM write cycle has completed, so a subsequent operation can be\nstarted.\nOnce the internally self-timed write cycle has started, an Acknowledge Polling routine can be initiated.\nThis involves repeatedly sending a Start condition followed by a valid device address byte with the R/ W\nbit set at logic ‘ 0’. The device will not respond with an ACK while the write cycle is ongoing. Once the\ninternal write cycle has completed, the EEPROM will respond with an ACK, allowing a new read or write\noperation to be immediately initiated. A flowchart has been included below in Figure 7-3  to better illustrate\nthis technique.\nFigure 7-3.\u2000Acknowledge Polling Flowchart\nDid \nthe device \nACK?Send any \nWrite \nprotocol.Send \nStop \ncondition \nto initiate the \nWrite cycle.Send Start \ncondition followed \nby a valid \nDevice Address \nbyte with R/W = 0.Proceed to \nnext Read or \nWrite operation.\nNOYES AT24C128C\nWrite Operations\n© 2018 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006110A-page 19\n7.4 Write Cycle Timing\nThe length of the self-timed write cycle (t WR) is defined as the amount of time from the Stop condition that\nbegins the internal write cycle to the Start condition of the first device address byte sent to the\nAT24C128C that it subsequently responds to with an ACK. Figure 7-4  has been included to show this\nmeasurement. During the internally self-timed write cycle, any attempts to read from or write to the\nmemory array will not be processed.\nFigure 7-4.\u2000Write Cycle Timing\ntWR\nStop\nConditionStart\nConditionData Word n\nACK D0 SDA\nStop\nConditionSCL 8 9\nACK\nFirst Acknowledge from the device\nto a valid device address sequence after\nwrite cycle is initiated. The minimum tWR \ncan only be determined through\nthe use of an ACK Polling routine.9\n7.5 Write Protection\nThe AT24C128C utilizes a hardware data protection scheme that allows the user to write ‑protect the\nentire memory contents when the WP pin is at V CC (or a valid V IH). No write protection will be set if the\nWP pin is at GND or left floating.\nTable 7-1.\u2000AT24C128C Write-Protect Behavior\nWP Pin Voltage Part of the Array Protected\nVCC Full Array\nGND None － Write Protection Not Enabled\nThe status of the WP pin is sampled at the Stop condition for every byte write or page write operation\nprior to the start of an internally self ‑timed write cycle. Changing the WP pin state after the Stop condition\nhas been sent will not alter or interrupt the execution of the write cycle.\nIf an attempt is made to write to the device while the WP pin has been asserted, the device will\nacknowledge the device address, word address and data bytes, but no write cycle will occur when the\nStop condition is issued. The device will immediately be ready to accept a new read or write command. AT24C128C\nWrite Operations\n© 2018 Microchip Technology Inc.  Datasheet DS20006110A-page 20\n8. Read Operations\nRead operations are initiated the same way as write operations with the exception that the Read/Write\nSelect bit in the device address byte must be a logic ‘ 1’. There are three read operations:\n• Current Address Read\n• Random Address Read\n• Sequential Read\n8.1 Current Address Read\nThe internal data word address counter maintains the last address accessed during the last read or write\noperation, incremented by one. This address stays valid between operations as long as the V CC is\nmaintained to the part. The address roll-over during a read is from the last byte of the last page to the first\nbyte of the first page of the memory.\nA current address read operation will output data according to the location of the internal data word\naddress counter. This is initiated with a Start condition, followed by a valid device address byte with the\nR/W bit set to logic ‘ 1’. The device will ACK this sequence and the current address data word is serially\nclocked out on the SDA line. All types of read operations will be terminated if the bus master does not\nrespond with an ACK (it NACKs) during the ninth clock cycle. After the NACK response, the master may\nsend a Stop condition to complete the protocol, or it can send a Start condition to begin the next\nsequence.\nFigure 8-1.\u2000Current Address Read\nSCL\nSDADevice Address Byte Data Word (n)\nStart Condition\nby Master ACK\nfrom SlaveNACK\nfrom MasterStop Condition\nby MasterMSB MSB 1 0 1 0 A2 A1 A0 1 0 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n8.2 Random Read\nA random read begins in the same way as a byte write operation does to load in a new data word\naddress. This is known as a “dummy write” sequence; however, the data byte and the Stop condition of\nthe byte write must be omitted to prevent the part from entering an internal write cycle. Once the device\naddress and word address are clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, the bus master must\ngenerate another Start condition. The bus master now initiates a current address read by sending a Start\ncondition, followed by a valid device address byte with the R/ W bit set to logic ‘ 1’. The EEPROM will ACK\nthe device address and serially clock out the data word on the SDA line. All types of read operations will\nbe terminated if the bus master does not respond with an ACK (it NACKs) during the ninth clock cycle.\nAfter the NACK response, the master may send a Stop condition to complete the protocol, or it can send\na Start condition to begin the next sequence.

After the bus master\nreceives a data word, it responds with an Acknowledge. As long as the EEPROM receives an ACK, it will\ncontinue to increment the word address and serially clock out sequential data words. When the maximum\nmemory address is reached, the data word address will roll-over and the sequential read will continue\nfrom the beginning of the memory array. All types of read operations will be terminated if the bus master\ndoes not respond with an ACK (it NACKs) during the ninth clock cycle. After the NACK response, the\nmaster may send a Stop condition to complete the protocol, or it can send a Start condition to begin the\nnext sequence.\nFigure 8-3.\u2000Sequential Read\nSCL\nSDA\nStart Condition\nby Master ACK\nfrom SlaveACK\nfrom MasterDevice Address Byte Data Word (n)\nMSB MSB 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n 1  0  1 0 A2 A1 A0 1 0 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 0\nACK\nfrom MasterNACK\nfrom MasterStop Condition\nby Master ACK\nfrom MasterData Word (n+1) Data Word (n+2) Data Word (n+x) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n  D7   D6   D5   D4  D3  D2   D1  D0 0 D7  D6 D5  D4  D3 D2 D1 D0 0 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 1\nMSB MSB MSB AT24C128C\nRead Operations\n© 2018 Microchip Technology Inc.
