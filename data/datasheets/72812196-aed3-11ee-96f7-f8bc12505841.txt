KG:\n1. General Customer Responsibility\nSome goods within the product range of Würth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co. KG contain statements regarding general suitability for certain\napplication areas. These statements about suitability are based on our knowledge and experience of typical requirements concerning the\nareas, serve as general guidance and cannot be estimated as binding statements about the suitability for a customer application. The\nresponsibility for the applicability and use in a particular customer design is always solely within the authority of the customer. Due to this\nfact it is up to the customer to evaluate, where appropriate to investigate and decide whether the device with the specific product\ncharacteristics described in the product specification is valid and suitable for the respective customer application or not.\n2. Customer Responsibility related to Specific, in particular Safety-Relevant Applications\nIt has to be clearly pointed out that the possibility of a malfunction of electronic components or failure before the end of the usual lifetime\ncannot be completely eliminated in the current state of the art, even if the products are operated within the range of the specifications.\nIn certain customer applications requiring a very high level of safety and especially in customer applications in which the malfunction or\nfailure of an electronic component could endanger human life or health it must be ensured by most advanced technological aid of suitable\ndesign of the customer application that no injury or damage is caused to third parties in the event of malfunction or failure of an electronic\ncomponent. Therefore, customer is cautioned to verify that data sheets are current before placing orders. The current data sheets can be\ndownloaded at www.we-online.com.\n3. Best Care and Attention\nAny product-specific notes, cautions and warnings must be strictly observed. Any disregard will result in the loss of warranty.\n4. Customer Support for Product Specifications\nSome products within the product range may contain substances which are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions in order to serve\nspecific technical requirements. Necessary information is available on request. In this case the field sales engineer or the internal sales\nperson in charge should be contacted who will be happy to support in this matter.\n5. Product R&D\nDue to constant product improvement product specifications may change from time to time. As a standard reporting procedure of the\nProduct Change Notification (PCN) according to the JEDEC-Standard inform about minor and major changes. In case of further queries\nregarding the PCN, the field sales engineer or the internal sales person in charge should be contacted. The basic responsibility of the\ncustomer as per Section 1 and 2 remains unaffected.6. Product Life Cycle\nDue to technical progress and economical evaluation we also reserve the right to discontinue production and delivery of products. As a\nstandard reporting procedure of the Product Termination Notification (PTN) according to the JEDEC-Standard we will inform at an early stage\nabout inevitable product discontinuance. According to this we cannot guarantee that all products within our product range will always be\navailable. Therefore it needs to be verified with the field sales engineer or the internal sales person in charge about the current product\navailability expectancy before or when the product for application design-in disposal is considered. The approach named above does not\napply in the case of individual agreements deviating from the foregoing for customer-specific products.\n7.
