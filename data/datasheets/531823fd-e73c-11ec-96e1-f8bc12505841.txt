The flat top lamps are also ideal for use as \nemitters in light pipe applications.\nDome Packages\nThe Broadcom HLMP-6xxx Series dome lamps for use as \nindicators use a tinted, diffused lens to provide a wide \nviewing angle with a high on-off contrast ratio. High \nbrightness lamps use an untinted, nondiffused lens to provide a high luminous intensity within a narrow radiation \npattern.\nResistor Lamps\nThe Broadcom HLMP-6xxx Series 5 volt subminiature \nlamps with built-in cu rrent limiting resistors are for use in \napplications where space is at a premium.\nLead Configurations\nAll of these devices are made by encapsulating LED chips \non axial lead frames to form molded epoxy subminiature \nlamp packages. A variety of package configuration options \nis available. These include special surface mount lead configurations, gull wing, yoke lead, or Z-bend. Right angle \nlead bends at 2.54 mm (0.100 inch) and 5.08mm (0.200 \ninch) center spacing are available for through hole mounting. For more information, refer to the Standard SMT \nand Through Hole Lead Bend Options for Subminiature \nLED Lamps data sheet.Features\n\uf06eSubminiature flat top package\n– Ideal for backlighting and light piping applications\n\uf06eSubminiature dome package\n– Diffused dome for wide viewing angle\n– Nondiffused dome for high brightness\n\uf06eTTL and LSTTL compatible 5V resistor lamps\n\uf06eAvailable in six colors\n\uf06eIdeal for space limited applications\n\uf06eAxial leads\n\uf06eAvailable with lead configurations for surface mount \nand through hole PCB mountingHLMP-Pxxx Series, HLMP-Qxxx Series, \nHLMP-6xxx Series, HLMP-70xx Series\nSubminiature LED Lamps\nBroadcom AV02-3609EN\n2HLMP-Pxxx Series, HLMP-Qxxx Series, HLMP-6xxx Series, HLMP-70xx Series  \nData Sheet Subminiature LED Lamps\nDevice Selection Guide\nPart Number: HLMP-xxxx\nPackage DimensionsStandard \nRedDH AS \nAlGaAs RedHigh Efficiency \nRed Orange YellowHigh Perf. \nGreenEmerald \nGreenDevice \nDescriptionDevice Outline \nDrawing\nP005 P105 P205 P405 P305 P505 P6 05 Untinted, Nondiffused, \nFlat TopA\nP102 P202 P402 P302 P502 Untinted, Diffused, \nFlat TopA\n6000 Q100 6300 Q400 6400 6500 Q600 Tinted, Diffused B\nQ105 6305 Q405 6405 6505 Q605 Untinted, Nondiffused, \nHigh BrightnessB\nQ150 7000 7019 7040 Tinted, Diffused, \nLow CurrentB\nQ155 Nondiffused, \nLow CurrentB\n6600 6800 Tinted, Diffused, \nResistor, 5V, 10 mAB\n6620 6720 6820 Diffused, Resistor, 5V, \n4 mAB\nA.
