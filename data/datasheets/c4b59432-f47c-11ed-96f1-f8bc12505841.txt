Noise Spectral Density for Different Values of C BYP\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADM7155  is an adjustable linear regulator that operates \nfrom 2.3 V to 5.5 V and provides up to 600 mA of load current. \nOutput voltages from 1.2 V to 3.4 V are possible depending on the model. Using an advanced proprietary architecture, it \nprovides high power supply rejection and ultralow noise, \nachieving excellent line and load transient response with only a \n10 μF ceramic output capacitor. \nThe ADM7155  is available in four models that optimize power \ndissipation and PSRR performance as a function of input and \noutput voltage. See Table 9 and Table 10 for selection guides. \nThe ADM7155  regulator typical output noise is 0.9 μV rms from \n100 Hz to 100 kHz for fixed output voltage options and 1.5 nV/√Hz \nfor noise spectral density from 10 kHz to 1 MHz.  \n The ADM7155  is available in 8-lead, 3 mm × 3 mm LFCSP and \n8-lead SOIC packages, making it not only a very compact \nsolution but also providing excellent thermal performance for applications requiring up to 600 mA of load current in a small, low profile footprint. \nTable 1.

Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may \naffect product reliability. \nTHERMAL DATA \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in \ncombination. The ADM7155  can be damaged when the \njunction temperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature does not guarantee that T\nJ is within the specified \ntemperature limits. In applications with high power dissipation \nand poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temper-\nature may need to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low \nprinted circuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit provided \nthat the junction temperature is within specification limits. The \njunction temperature (T\nJ) of the device is dependent on the \nambient temperature (T A), the power dissipation of the device \n(PD), and the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance of the \npackage (θ JA). \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) using the \nfollowing formula: \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) Junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (θJA) of the package is based on modeling and calculation using a 4-layer PCB. The junction-to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on the application and PCB layout. In applications where high \nmaximum power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal \nPCB design is required. The value of θ\nJA may vary, depending \non PCB material, layout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of θ\nJA are based on a 4-layer, 4 in. × 3 in. circuit \nboard. See JESD51-7 and JESD51-9 for detailed information on the board construction. \nΨ\nJB is the junction-to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W . Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4-layer PCB. JESD51-12, Guidelines for \nReporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , \nstates that thermal characterization parameters are not the same \nas thermal resistances. Ψ JB measures the component power \nflowing through multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in thermal resistance, θ\nJB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths \ninclude convection from the top of the package as well as radiation from the package, factors that make Ψ\nJB more useful \nin real-world applications.

C | Page 14 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM7155  is an ultralow noise, high power supply rejection \nratio (PSRR) linear regulator targeting radio frequency (RF) \napplications. The input voltage range is 2.3 V to 5.5 V , and it can deliver up to 600 mA of load current. Typical shutdown current consumption is 0.2 μA at room temperature.  \nOptimized for use with 10 μF ceramic capacitors, the ADM7155  \nprovides excellent transient performance. \n12325-042VREG\nGNDVOUT VIN\nEN\nREFREF_SENSE1.2V REFERENCE\nSHUTDOWNACTIVE RIPPLE\nFILTER\nCURRENT-LIMIT,\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\nOTABYPADM7155-03 VREG = 3.2V\nADM7155-04 V REG = 3.6VADM7155-01 VREG = 2.1V\nADM7155-02 V REG = 2.6V\n \nFigure 42. Simplified Internal Block Diagram \nInternally, the ADM7155  consists of a reference, an error \namplifier, and a P-channel MOSFET pass transistor. Output \ncurrent is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is lower \nthan the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is \npulled lower, allowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltage. If the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, \nallowing less current to pass and decreasing the output voltage.  \nBy heavily filtering the reference voltage, the ADM7155  is able \nto achieve 1.5 nV/√Hz output typical from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. \nBecause the error amplifier is always in unity gain, the output \nnoise is independent of the output voltage. \nTo maintain very high PSRR over a wide frequency range, the \nADM7155  architecture uses an internal active ripple filter. This \nstage isolates the low output noise LDO from noise on the VIN pin. The result is that the PSRR of the ADM7155  is significantly \nhigher over a wider frequency range than any single stage LDO. \nThe ADM7155  output voltage can be adjusted between 1.2 V \nand 3.4 V and is available in four models that optimize the \ninput voltage and output voltage ranges to keep power dissipation as low as possible without compromising PSRR performance. The output voltage is determined by an external \nvoltage divider according to the following equation: \nV\nOUT = 1.2 V × (1 + R1 /R2) \nVOUT\nREF\nREF_SENSE\nGNDVIN\nEN\nBYP\nVREGVBYP\nVREGADM7155-04\nCREG\n10µFCBYP\n1µFCREF\n1µF\nVOUT = 1.2V × (1 + R1/R2)\n1kΩ < R2 < 200k ΩCIN\n10µFCOUT\n10µF\nOFFONVIN = 4.0V VOUT = 3.3V\nR1\nR2\n12325-200 \nFigure 43. Typical Adjustable Output Voltage Application Schematic \nThe R2 value must be greater than 1 kΩ to prevent excessive \nloading of the reference voltage appearing on the REF pin. To minimize errors in the output voltage caused by the REF_SENSE pin input current, the R2 value must be less than 200 kΩ. For example, when R1 and R2 each equal 200 kΩ, the output \nvoltage is 2.4 V . The output voltage error introduced by the \nREF_SENSE pin input current is 10 mV or 0.33%, assuming a maximum REF_SENSE pin input current of 100 nA at T\nJ = \n125°C. \nThe ADM7155  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT \npin under normal operating conditions. When EN is high, \nVOUT turns on, and when EN is low, VOUT turns off. For automatic startup, tie EN to VIN. \nVREGVIN\nREF_SENSEREF\nVOUTBYP\nGNDEN\n7V 4V4V\n4V4V\n4V 4V4V\n4V7V\n7V\n12325-043 \nFigure 44.

ADIsimPower is a collection of tools that produce complete \npower designs optimized for a specific design goal. The tools enable the user to generate a full schematic, bill of materials, \nand calculate performance within minutes. ADIsimPower can \noptimize designs for cost, area, efficiency, and device count, taking into consideration the operating conditions and limitations of the IC and all real external components. For more information about, and to obtain ADIsimPower design tools, \nvisit www.analog.com/ADIsimPower . \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nMultilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) combine small size, low \nESR, low ESL, and wide operating temperature range, making \nthem an ideal choice for bypass capacitors. They are not without \nfaults, however. Depending on the dielectric material, the capacitance can vary dramatically with temperature, dc bias, and ac signal level. Therefore, selecting the proper capacitor \nresults in the best circuit performance. \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADM7155  is designed for operation with ceramic \ncapacitors but functions with most commonly used capacitors \nwhen care is taken with regard to the effective series resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 10 μF capacitance with \nan ESR of 0.2 Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability \nof the ADM7155 . Output capacitance also affects transient \nresponse to changes in load current. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADM7155  to large changes in load current. Figure 45 shows the \ntransient responses for an output capacitance value of 10 μF. \nCH1  200mA  ΩBW M4µs A  CH1      212mA\nT  10.2%1\nCH2  5mV BW2T\n12325-144 \nFigure 45. Output Transient Response, V OUT = 3.3 V, C OUT = 10 μF,  \nCH1 = Load Current, CH2 = V OUT \n \n Input and VREG Capacitor \nConnecting a 10 μF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the \ncircuit sensitivity to PCB layout, especially when long input traces or high source impedance are encountered.  \nTo maintain the best possible stability and PSRR performance, \nconnect a 10 μF capacitor from VREG to GND. When more than 10 μF of output capacitance is required, increase the input \nand the VREG capacitors, C\nREG, to match it. \nREF Capacitor \nThe REF capacitor, C REF, is necessary to stabilize the reference \namplifier. Connect at least a 1 μF capacitor between REF and GND. \nBYP Capacitor \nThe BYP capacitor, C BYP, is necessary to filter the reference \nbuffer. A 1 μF capacitor is typically connected between BYP and \nGND. Capacitors as small as 0.1 μF can be used; however, the output noise voltage of the LDO increases as a result. \nIn addition, the BYP capacitor va lue can be increased to reduce \nthe noise below 1 kHz at the expense of increasing the start-up \ntime of the LDO. Very large values of C\nBYP significantly reduce \nthe noise below 10 Hz. Tantalum capacitors are recommended for capacitors larger than approximately 33 μF because solid tantalum capacitors are less prone to microphonic noise issues. \nA 1 μF ceramic capacitor in parallel with the larger tantalum \ncapacitor is recommended to ensure good noise performance at \nhigher frequencies. \nOUTPUT NOISE (µV rms)\nCBYP (µF)1000 1 10 10000.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82.010Hz TO 100kHz\n100Hz TO 100kHz\n12325-045 \nFigure 46.

Noise Spectral Density vs. Frequency for  \nDifferent Capacitances (C BYP) \nCapacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the \nADM7155  if they meet the minimum capacitance and \nmaximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different \nbehavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V to 50 V \nare recommended. However, Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are \nnot recommended because of their poor temperature and dc \nbias characteristics.  \nFigure 48 depicts the capacitance vs. dc bias voltage of a 1206, \n10 μF, 10 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage rating \nexhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R \ndielectric is ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range \nand is not a function of package or voltage rating. \nCAPACITANCE (µF)\nDC BIAS VOLTAGE (V)10 048 26012\n10\n8\n642\n12325-047 \nFigure 48. Capacitance vs. DC Bias Voltage  \n Use Equation 1 to determine the worst case capacitance \naccounting for capacitor variation over temperature, \ncomponent tolerance, and voltage. \nCEFF = CBIAS × (1 − TEMPCO ) × (1 − TOL) (1) \nwhere: \nCBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage. \nTEMPCO  is the worst case capacitor temperature coefficient. \nTOL  is the worst case component tolerance. \nIn this example, the worst case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO) over −40°C to +85°C is assumed to be 15% for an X5R dielectric. The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed \nto be 10%, and C\nBIAS is 9.72 μF at 5 V , as shown in Figure 48. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields \nCEFF = 9.72 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 7.44 μF \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over \ntemperature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage. \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADM7155 , it is imperative \nthat the effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the \nbehavior of the capacitors be evaluated for each application. \nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT (UVLO) \nThe ADM7155  also incorporates an internal UVLO circuit to \ndisable the output voltage when the input voltage is less than the minimum input voltage rating of the regulator. The upper and lower thresholds are internally fixed with about 200 mV of \nhysteresis.  \nOUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)\nINPUT VOLTAGE (V)2.30 2.25 2.20 2.15 2.10 2.05 2.00 1.95 1.9002.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.00.5–40°C+25°C+125°C\n12325-048 \nFigure 49.

Typical Start-Up Behavior with C BYP = 10 μF to 330 μF \nREF, BYP, AND VREG PINS \nREF, BYP , and VREG generate voltages internally (V REF, V BYP, \nand V REG) that require external bypass capacitors for proper \noperation. Do not, under any circumstances, connect any loads \nto these pins, because doing so compromises the noise and \nPSRR performance of the ADM7155 . Using larger values of \nCBYP, C REF, and C REG is acceptable but can increase the start-up \ntime, as described in the Start-Up Time section. \nCURRENT-LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADM7155  is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by current and thermal overload protection \ncircuits. The ADM7155  is designed to current limit when the \noutput load reaches 960 mA (typical). When the output load exceeds 960 mA, the output voltage is reduced to maintain a \nconstant current limit. \nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the \njunction temperature to a maximum of 150°C. Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and/or high power dissipation), when the junction temperature starts to rise \nabove 150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output \ncurrent to zero. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again, and the output current is \nrestored to the operating value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to GND \noccurs. At first, the ADM7155  current limits, so that only \n960 mA is conducted into the short. If self heating of the junction is great enough to cause the temperature to rise above \n150°C, thermal shutdown activates, turning off the output and \nreducing the output current to zero. As the junction tempera-ture cools and drops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 900 mA into the short, again causing the junction temperature to rise above 150°C. This thermal oscillation \nbetween 135°C and 150°C causes a current oscillation between \n900 mA and 0 mA that continues for as long as the short \nremains at the output. \nCurrent-limit and thermal limit protections are intended to \nprotect the device against accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, device power dissipation must be externally \nlimited so that the junction temperature does not exceed 150°C. \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS \nIn applications with a low input to output voltage differential, \nthe ADM7155  does not dissipate much heat. However, in \napplications with high ambient temperature and/or high input \nvoltage, the heat dissipated in the package may become large enough that it causes the junction temperature of the die to \nexceed the maximum junction temperature of 150°C. \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction temperature decreases below 135°C to prevent any permanent \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application \nis important to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient temperature of the environment and the tempera-ture rise of the package due to the power dissipation, as shown \nin Equation 2. \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the \nADM7155  must not exceed 150°C. To ensure that the junction \ntemperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be \naware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature changes. These parameters include ambient temperature, power dissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between the junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is \ndependent on the package assembly compounds that are used and the amount of copper used to solder the package GND pin \nand exposed pad to the PCB. \nTable 7 shows typical θ\nJA values of the 8-lead SOIC and 8-lead \nLFCSP packages for various PCB copper sizes. Table 8 shows the typical Ψ\nJB values of the 8-lead SOIC and  \n8-lead LFCSP . \n  \nData Sheet ADM7155\n \nRev. C | Page 19 of 24 Table 7.

Typical Ψ JB Values  \nPackage Ψ JB (°C/W) \n8-Lead LFCSP 15.1  \n8-Lead SOIC 17.9 \nThe junction temperature of the ADM7155  is calculated from \nthe following equation: \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) (2) \nwhere: \nTA is the ambient temperature. \nPD is the power dissipation in the die, given by \nPD = (( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD) + (V IN × I GND) (3) \nwhere: V\nIN and V OUT are the input and output voltages, respectively. \nILOAD is the load current. \nIGND is the ground current. \nPower dissipation caused by ground current is quite small and can be ignored. Therefore, the junction temperature equation \nsimplifies to the following: \nT\nJ = TA + ((( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD) × θJA) (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given ambient temperature, input \nto output voltage differential, and continuous load current, \nthere exists a minimum copper size requirement for the PCB to \nensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 150°C. \nThe heat dissipation from the package can be improved by \nincreasing the amount of copper attached to the pins and exposed pad of the ADM7155 . Adding thermal planes \nunderneath the package also improves thermal performance. \nHowever, as shown in Table 7, a point of diminishing returns is \neventually reached, beyond which an increase in the copper area does not yield significant reduction in the junction to \nambient thermal resistance. \nFigure 56 to Figure 61 show junction temperature calculations \nfor different ambient temperatures, power dissipation, and areas \nof PCB copper. \nJUNCTION TEMPERATURE (°C)\nTOTAL POWER DISSIPATION (W)6400mm 2\n500mm2\n25mm 2\nTJ MAX\n2535455565758595105115125135145155\n0 0 . 20 . 40 . 60 . 81 . 01 . 21 . 41 . 61 . 82 . 02 . 22 . 42 . 62 . 83 . 0\n12325-055 \nFigure 56.
