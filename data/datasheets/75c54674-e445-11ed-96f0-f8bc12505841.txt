ADP1716 with Output Voltage Tracking \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADP1715/ADP1716 are low dropout, CMOS linear \nregulators that operate from 2.5 V to 5.5 V and provide up to \n500 mA of output current. Using an advanced proprietary \narchitecture, they provide high power supply rejection and \nachieve excellent line and load transient response with just a \nsmall 2.2 μF ceramic output capacitor. \nThree versions of this part are available, one with fixed \noutput voltage options and variable soft start (ADP1715), \none with adjustable output voltage and fixed soft start (ADP1715 Adjustable), and one with voltage tracking in fixed output voltage options (ADP1716). The fixed output voltage options are internally set to one of sixteen values between 0.75 V and 3.3 V; the adjustable output voltage can \nbe set to any value between 0.8 V and 5.0 V by an external \nvoltage divider connected from OUT to ADJ. The variable soft start uses an external capacitor at SS to control the output voltage ramp. Tracking limits the output voltage to \nthe at-or-below voltage at the TRK pin.  \nThe ADP1715/ADP1716 are available in 8-lead thermally \nenhanced MSOP packages, making them not only a very \ncompact solution but also providing excellent thermal performance for applications requiring up to 500 mA of output current in a small, low profile footprint. \nADP1715/ADP1716  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 2 of 20

Supply current in shutdown mode is typically 100 nA. \nSOFT\nSTARTREFERENCECURRENT LIMIT\nTHERMAL PROTECT\nSHUTDOWN\nGNDOUT\nSS/\nADJ/\nTRKIN\nEN\n06110-021 \nFigure 26. Internal Block Diagram \nInternally, the ADP1715/ADP1716 consist of a reference, an \nerror amplifier, a feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass \ntransistor. Output current is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback \nvoltage from the output and amplifies the difference. If the \nfeedback voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower, allowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltage. If the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device \nis pulled higher, allowing less current to pass and decreasing the \noutput voltage.  \nThe ADP1715 is available in two versions, one with fixed output \nvoltage options and one with an adjustable output voltage. The \nfixed output voltage options are set internally to one of sixteen values between 0.75 V and 3.3 V , using an internal feedback network. The adjustable output voltage can be set to between 0.8 V and 5.0 V by an external voltage divider connected from OUT to ADJ. The fixed output version of ADP1715 allows for \nconnection of an external soft-start capacitor, which controls \nthe output voltage ramp during startup. The ADP1716 features a track pin and is available with fixed output voltage options. All \ndevices are controlled by an enable pin (EN).  \nSOFT-START FUNCTION (ADP1715) \nFor applications that require a controlled startup, the ADP1715 \nprovides a programmable soft-start function. Programmable \nsoft start is useful for reducing inrush current upon startup and \nfor providing voltage sequencing. To implement soft start, connect a small ceramic capacitor from SS to GND. Upon \nstartup, a 1.2 μA current source charges this capacitor. The ADP1715 start-up output voltage is limited by the voltage at SS, providing a smooth ramp up to the nominal output voltage. The soft-start time is calculated by \nTSS = VREF × (CSS/ISS) (1) \nwhere: \nTSS is the soft-start period. \nVREF is the 0.8 V reference voltage. \nCSS is the soft-start capacitance from SS to GND. \nISS is the current sourced from SS (1.2 μA). \nWhen the ADP1715 is disabled (using EN), the soft-start capacitor is discharged to GND through an internal 100 Ω resistor.  \n21EN\nOUT\nVIN = 5V\nVOUT = 3.3V\nCOUT = 2.2µF\nCSS = 22nF\nILOAD  = 500mA\n06110-041\nTIME (4ms/DIV)2V/DI V 1V/DI V\n \nFigure 27. OUT Ramp-Up with Ex ternal Soft-Start Capacitor \nThe ADP1715 adjustable version and the ADP1716 have no \npins for soft start, so the function is switched to an internal soft-\nstart capacitor. This sets the soft-start ramp-up period to approximately 24 μs. For the worst-case output voltage of 5 V , using the suggested 2.2 μF output capacitor, the resulting input \ninrush current is approximately 460 mA, which is less than the \nmaximum 500 mA load current. \n21\nVIN=5 V\nVOUT=1 . 6 V\nCOUT=2 . 2 µ F\nILOAD = 10mAOUTEN\n06110-042\nTIME (20µs/DIV)2V/DI V 1V/DI V\n \nFigure 28.

The output voltage is set by \nconnecting a resistive voltage divider from OUT to ADJ. The output voltage is calculated using the equation \nVOUT = 0.8 V (1 + R1/R2) (2) \nwhere: \nR1 is the resistor from OUT to ADJ. \nR2 is the resistor from ADJ to GND. \nThe maximum bias current into ADJ is 100 nA, so for less \nthan 0.5% error due to the bias current, use values less than  \n60 kΩ for R2. \nTRACK MODE (ADP1716) \nThe ADP1716 includes a tracking mode feature. As shown in \nFigure 29 , if the voltage applied at the TRK pin is less than the \nnominal output voltage, OUT is equal to the voltage at TRK. Otherwise, OUT regulates to its nominal output value. \n4\n05\n06110-047\nVTRK (V)VOUT (V)\n03\n2\n1\n1234\n \nFigure 29. ADP1716 Output Voltage vs. Tracking Voltage \nwith Nominal Output Voltage Set to 3 V \nFor example, consider an ADP1716 with a nominal output \nvoltage of 3 V . If the voltage applied to its TRK pin is greater \nthan 3 V , OUT maintains a nominal output voltage of 3 V . If \nthe voltage applied to TRK is reduced below 3 V , OUT tracks this voltage. OUT can track the TRK pin voltage from the nominal value all the way down to 0 V . A voltage divider is present from TRK to the error amplifier input with a divider \nratio equal to the divider from OUT to the error amplifier. \nThis sets the output voltage equal to the tracking voltage. Both divider ratios are set by post-package trim, depending on the \ndesired output voltage. ENABLE FEATURE \nThe ADP1715/ADP1716 use the EN pin to enable and disable \nthe OUT pin under normal operating conditions. As shown in \nFigure 30 , when a rising voltage on EN crosses the active \nthreshold, OUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN crosses \nthe inactive threshold, OUT turns off. \n1EN\nOUT\nVIN = 5V\nVOUT = 1.6V\nCOUT = 2.2µF\nILOAD  = 10mA\n06110-043\nTIME (1ms/DIV)CH1, CH2 (500mV/DIV)\n \nFigure 30. ADP1715 Adjustable Typical EN Pin Operation \nAs can be seen, the EN pin has hysteresis built in. This prevents \non/off oscillations that can occur due to noise on the EN pin as \nit passes through the threshold points.  \nThe EN pin active/inactive thresholds are derived from the IN \nvoltage. Therefore, these thresholds vary with changing input \nvoltage.

The ESR of the output capacitor affects stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of \n2.2 μF capacitance with an ESR of 500 mΩ or less is recommended \nto ensure stability of the ADP1715/ADP1716. Transient response to changes in load current is also affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP1715/ADP1716 to large changes in load \ncurrent. \nFigure 32  and Figure 33  show the transient responses for \noutput capacitance values of 2.2 μF and 22 μF. \n21SWITCH SIGNAL TO CHANGE\nOUTPUT LOAD FROM 25mA TO 475mA\nVOUT\nVIN = 5V\nVOUT = 3.3V\nCIN = 2.2µF\nCOUT = 2.2µF\n06110-045\nTIME (2µs/DIV)2V/DI V 20mV/DI V\n \nFigure 32.

Output Transient Response \nInput Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 2.2 μF capacitor from the IN pin to GND reduces \nthe circuit sensitivity to printed circuit board (PCB) layout, \nespecially when long input traces, or high source impedance, is encountered. If greater than 2.2 μF of output capacitance is \nrequired, the input capacitor should be increased to match it. Input and Output Capacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the \nADP1715/ADP1716, as long as they meet the minimum \ncapacitance and maximum ESR requirements. Ceramic \ncapacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary temperature range \nand dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage \nrating of 6.3 V or 10 V are recommended. Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not recommended, due to their poor temperature \nand dc bias characteristics.  \nCURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADP1715/ADP1716 are protected against damage due to \nexcessive power dissipation by current and thermal overload \nprotection circuits. The ADP1715/ADP1716 are designed to \ncurrent limit when the output load reaches 750 mA (typical). When the output load exceeds 750 mA, the output voltage is \nreduced to maintain a constant current limit.  \nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the \njunction temperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under \nextreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and power dissipation) when the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output \ncurrent to zero. When the junction temperature drops below \n135°C, the output is turned on again and output current is \nrestored to its nominal value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from OUT to ground \noccurs. At first the ADP1715/ADP1716 will current limit, so \nthat only 750 mA is conducted into the short. If self heating of the junction is great enough to cause its temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal shutdown will activate, turning off the \noutput and reducing the output current to zero. As the \njunction temperature cools and drops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 750 mA into the short, again causing \nthe junction temperature to rise above 150°C. This thermal \noscillation between 135°C and 150°C causes a current oscillation between 750 mA and 0 mA that continues as long as the short remains at the output. \nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect the device against accidental overload conditions. For reliable \noperation, device power dissipation should be externally limited \nso junction temperatures do not exceed 125°C. \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the \nADP1715/ADP1716 should not exceed 125°C. To ensure the \njunction temperature stays below this maximum value, the user  \n  ADP1715/ADP1716\n \nRev. 0 | Page 13 of 20 should be aware of the parameters that contribute to junction \ntemperature changes. These parameters include ambient \ntemperature, power dissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between the junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA \nnumber is dependent on the package assembly compounds used and the amount of copper to which the GND pins of the package \nare soldered to on the PCB. \nTable 5  shows typical θ JA values of the \n8-lead thermally enhanced MSOP package for various PCB \ncopper sizes. \nTable 5.  \nCopper Size (mm2) θJA (°C/W)  \n01 118 \n100 99 \n300 77 \n500 75 \n700 74 \n1 Device soldered to minimum size pin traces. \nThe junction temperature of the ADP1715/ADP1716 can be calculated from the following equation: \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) (3) \nwhere: \nTA is the ambient temperature. \nPD is the power dissipation in the die, given by \nPD = [(VIN – VOUT) × ILOAD] + (VIN × IGND) (4) \nwhere: \nILOAD is the load current. \nIGND is ground current. \nVIN and V OUT are input and output voltages, respectively. \nPower dissipation due to ground current is quite small and can \nbe ignored. Therefore, the junction temperature equation \nsimplifies to the following: \nTJ = TA + {[(VIN – VOUT) × ILOAD] × θJA} (5) \nAs shown in Equation 5, for a given ambient temperature, input \nto output voltage differential, and continuous load current, \nthere exists a minimum copper size requirement for the PCB to \nensure the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C.

Heat \ndissipation from the package is increased by connecting as much \ncopper as possible to the four GND pins of the ADP1715/ \nADP1716. From Table 5  it can be seen that a point of \ndiminishing returns eventually is reached, beyond which an increase in the copper size does not yield additional heat \ndissipation benefits. \nFigure 46  shows a typical layout for the ADP1715/ADP1716. \nThe four GND pins are connected to a large copper pad. If a \nsecond layer is available, multiple vias can be used to connect them, increasing the overall copper area. The input capacitor \nshould be placed as close as possible to the IN and GND pins. \nThe output capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the OUT and GND pins. 0603 or 0402 size capacitors and resistors should be used to achieve the smallest possible footprint \nsolution on boards where area is limited. \nGND (TOP)\nGND (BOTTOM)C1 C2\nC3 R2R1\nENIN OUTADP1715/\nADP1716\n06110-048 \nFigure 46.
