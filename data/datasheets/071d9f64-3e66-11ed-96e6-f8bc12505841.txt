[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a technical specialist with expertise in electronics. Your task is to analyze datasheets for electronic components and provide a concise summary of the product’s key characteristics and specifications. In addition, you need to gather textual information about the component, including its description and typical applications.Instructions:    Identify the correct component in the datasheet using the provided product code.    Summarize key parameters, including:        Voltage ratings        Current ratings        Power consumption        Operating temperature range        Package type        Special features or notes (if applicable)        Moisture Sensetive Level JEDEC J-STD-020E    Provide a short description of the component, including what it is (e.g., transistor, microcontroller, sensor) and its primary function.    Explain typical applications for the component (e.g., power management, signal processing, data storage, etc.).    Be thorough and accurate: Ensure the information corresponds specifically to the product code, as some datasheets cover multiple variants.Your goal is to create a clear and accurate technical summary that includes both key specifications and a description of what the component is used for.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Give me information about the component of MFR-25FBF52-2K61 production of YAGEO from the text:  \n DATA SHEET\nMETAL  \nGeneral \nRoHS compliant\nProduct specification – September 28, 2021  V.1 \n  \n \n \n  A SHEET\n FILM RESISTORS\nGeneral Purpose\nMFR Series\n±0.5%,  ±1%,  ±2%,  ±5% \n1/6W to 3W\nRoHS compliant  & Halogen Free\n \n\nSep. 28, 2021   V.0  \n  \n Metal Film Resistors  \n    \nMFR Through Hole Resistor s \n \n \n \n \nAPPLICATIONS  \n\x9f All general purpose \napplications \n\x9f Power applications \n \n \n \nEATURES  \n\x9f AEC-Q200 qualified \n\x9f Wide resistance range \n\x9f PPAP ready \n(MFR-25/MFR50S/MFR-50) \n\x9f High stability \n\x9f RoHS compliant & \nhalogen-free \n  \nORDERING\nPart number of the general \nthe series, \nforming\n \nPART NUMBER\n \nMFR\n(1)   \n(1) SERIES\nMFR S\n \n(2) POWER RATING\n-12\n25S\n-25\n50S\n \n(3) TOLERANCE\nD\nJ \n \n(4) PACKAGING\nR = \n(5) TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTANCE\nE\n \n(6) FORMING\n26\n52\n73\nM = M\nMB = \nF = F Type \nFK = FK Type\n52A=52.4mm\n52B=52.4mm\n52C=52.4mm\n52G=52.4mm\n52H=52.4mm \n \n(7) RESISTANCE VALUE\nE24 & E96\nExample: \n100\n  \n \nORDERING  INFORMATION  \nPart number of the general purpose metal film resistor are identified by \nthe series, power rating, tolerance, packing , temperature coefficient, \nforming  and resistance value. \nPART NUMBER  \nMFR     200     F     T      F     73-     100R   \n(1)       (2)     (3)    (4)     (5)    (6)      (7)  \nSERIES  \nMFR S eries \n \nPOWER RATING  \n12 = 1/6W \n25S = 1/4W \n25 = 1/4W \n50S = 1/2W \n -50 = 1/2W \n100 = 1W \n2WS = 2W 200\n3WS\n1WS\n(3) TOLERANCE  \nD = ±0.5% \n = ±5% \n F = ±1% G = ±\n(4) PACKAGING  \nR = Reel Pack  T = Box Pack B = \n(5) TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT OF RESISTANCE  \nE=±50ppm/°C \n F=±100ppm/°C \n -
