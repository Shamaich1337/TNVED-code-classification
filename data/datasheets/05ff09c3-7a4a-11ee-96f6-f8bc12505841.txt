It \nis also excellent for improving vocal clarity in communications \nand public address systems. A low noise, voltage-controlled \namplifier (VCA) provides a gain that is dynamically adjusted by a control loop to maintain a set compression characteristic. The compression ratio is set by a single resistor and can be varied from 1:1 to over 15:1 relative to a user-defined rotation point; signals above the rotation point are limited to prevent overload and to eliminate popping. In the 1:1 compression setting, the \nSSM2166 can be programmed with a fixed gain of up to 20 dB; \nthis gain is in addition to the variable gain in other compression settings. The input buffer can also be configured for front-end gains of 0 dB to 20 dB. A downward expander (noise gate) prevents amplification of noise or hum. This results in optimized signal \nlevels prior to digitization, thereby eliminating the need for \nadditional gain or attenuation in the digital domain that may add noise or impair accuracy of speech recognition algorithms. The compression ratio and time constants are set externally. A high degree of flexibility is provided by the VCA gain, rotation point, and noise gate adjustment pins. \nThe SSM2166 is an ideal companion product for audio codecs \nused in computer systems. The SSM2166 is available in a 14-lead \nSOIC package and is guaranteed for operation over the \nextended industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C.  \n10\n0\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40\n–50\n–60\n–70 –60 –50 –40 –30 –20 –10 0\nINPUT (dBu)OUTPUT (dBu)\n00357-002COMP RATIO = 10:1\nCOMP RATIO = 2:1\nCOMP RATIO = 1:1\n \nFigure 1.

A resistor from this pin to ground sets the fixed gain of the VCA. To check the setting of \nthis pin, make sure the compression ratio set pin (Pin  10) is grounded for no compression. The gain can be \nvaried from 0 dB to 20 dB. For 20 dB, leave the pin open. For 0 dB of fixed gain, a typical resistor value is \napproximately 1 kΩ. For 10 dB of fixed gain, the resistor va lue is approximately 2 kΩ to 3 kΩ. For resistor values \n<1 kΩ, the VCA can attenuate or mute (see Figure 6).  \n3  VCA IN  VCA Input Pin.

F | Page 8 of 13 THEORY OF OPERATION \nFigure 15 illustrates a typical transfer characteristic for the \nSSM2166 where the output level in decibels is plotted as a function of the input level in decibels. The dotted line indicates the transfer characteristic for a unity-gain amplifier. For input \nsignals in the range of V\nDE (downward expansion) to V RP (rotation \npoint), an r dB change in the input level causes a 1 dB change in \nthe output level. Here, r is defined as the compression ratio. The compression ratio can be varied from 1:1 (no compression) to over 15:1 via a single resistor, R\nCOMP. Input signals above V RP \nare compressed with a fixed compression ratio of approximately 15:1. This region of operation is the limiting region. Varying the compression ratio has no effect on the limiting region. The break-point between the compression region and the limiting region is referred to as the limiting threshold or the rotation point and is user specified in the SSM2166 . The rotation point term derives \nfrom the observation that the straight line in the compression region rotates about this point on the input/output characteristic as \nthe compression ratio is changed. \nThe gain of the system with an input signal level of V\nRP is fixed \nby R GAIN, regardless of the compression ratio, and is the nominal \ngain of the system. The user can increase the nominal gain of \nthe system via the on-board VCA by up to 20 dB. Additionally, \nthe input buffer of the SSM2166 can provide fixed gains of 0 dB \nto 20 dB with R1 and R2. \nInput signals below V DE are downward expanded; that is, a \n−1 dB change in the input signal level causes approximately a \n−3 dB change in the output level. As a result, the gain of the system is small for very small input signal levels, even though it may be quite large for small input signals above V\nDE. The user \nsets the downward expansion threshold, V DE, externally via \nRGATE at Pin 9 (NOISE GATE SET). The SSM2166 provides an \nactive high, CMOS-compatible digital input whereby a power-\ndown feature reduces the device supply current to less than 100 μA. \nLIMITING\nREGIONLIMITIN G\nTHRESHOLD\n(ROTATION POINT)\nCOMPRESSION\nREGION\n1\nr\n1\n1DOWNWARD\nEXPANSION\nTHRESHOLD\n(NOISE GATE)\nDOWNWARD\nEXPANSION\nREGIONVCA GAIN\nVRPOUTPUT (dB)\nINPUT (dB)\n00357-015VDE\n \nFigure 15. General Input/ Output Characteristics  \n \n APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe SSM2166 is a complete microphone signal conditioning \nsystem on a single integrated circuit. Designed primarily for voice-\nband applications, this integrated circuit provides amplification, rms detection, limiting, variable compression, and downward \nexpansion. An integral voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) \nprovides up to 60 dB of gain in the signal path with approximately 30 kHz bandwidth. An input buffer, op amp circuit can provide additional gain because the circuit can be set anywhere from 0 dB to 20 dB for a total signal path gain of up to 80 dB. The device operates on a single 5 V supply, accepts input signals up to 1 V \nrms, and produces output signal levels >1 V rms (3 V p-p) into \nloads >5 kΩ. The internal rms detector has a time constant set \nby an external capacitor. \nThe SSM2166 contains an input buffer and automatic gain \ncontrol (AGC) circuit for audio-band and voice-band signals. \nCircuit operation is optimized by providing a user-adjustable time constant and compression ratio. A downward expansion \n(noise gating) feature eliminates circuit noise in the absence of \nan input signal. The SSM2166 allows the user to set the downward \nexpansion threshold, the limiting threshold (rotation point), the input buffer fixed gain, and the internal VCA nominal gain at the rotation point. The SSM2166 also features a power-down \nmode and muting capability. \nSIGNAL PATH \nFigure 16 illustrates the block diagram of the SSM2166. The \naudio input signal is processed by the input buffer and then by the VCA. The input buffer presents an input impedance of approximately 180 kΩ to the source. A dc voltage of approximately 1.5 V is present at AUDIO +IN (Pin 7), requiring the use of a blocking capacitor (C1) for ground referenced sources. A 0.1 μF \ncapacitor is a good choice for most audio applications. The input \nbuffer is a unity-gain stable amplifier that can drive the low \nimpedance input of the VCA. \nThe VCA is a low distortion, variable-gain amplifier (VGA) \nwhose gain is set by the side-chain control circuitry. The input to the VCA is a virtual ground in series with approximately 1 kΩ. An external blocking capacitor (C6) must be used between the \nbuffer output and the VCA input. The 1 kΩ impedance between \namplifiers determines the value of this capacitor, which is typically between 1 μF and 10 μF. An aluminum electrolytic capacitor is an economical choice. The VCA amplifies the input signal current flowing through C6 and converts this current to a voltage at the OUTPUT pin (Pin 13). The net gain from input to output can \nbe as high as 60 dB (without additional buffer gain), depending \non the gain set by the control circuitry. \n  \n \n \nData Sheet SSM2166\n \nRev. F | Page 9 of 13 The gain of the VCA at the rotation point is set by the value of a \nresistor, R GAIN, connected between Pin 2 and GND. The relationship \nbetween the VCA gain and R GAIN is shown in Figure 6. The AGC \nrange can be as high as 60 dB. The VCA IN pin (Pin 3) is the non-\ninverting input terminal to the VCA. The inverting input of the VCA is available at the VCA\nR pin (Pin 4) and exhibits an input \nimpedance of 1 kΩ, as well. As a result, this pin can be used for differential inputs or for the elimination of grounding problems by connecting a capacitor whose value equals that used in series with the VCA\nIN pin to ground. \nThe output impedance of the SSM2166 is typically less than 75 Ω, \nand the external load on Pin 13 must be >5 kΩ. The nominal output dc voltage of the device is approximately 2.2 V . Use a \nblocking capacitor for grounded loads. \nThe bandwidth of the SSM2166  is quite wide at all gain settings. \nThe upper 3 dB point is approximately 30 kHz at gains as high as \n60 dB (using the input buffer for additional gain, circuit bandwidth is unaffected). The gain bandwidth (GBW) plots are shown in \nFigure 11. The lower 3 dB cutoff frequency of the SSM2166 is \nset by the input impedance of the VCA (1 kΩ) and C6. While the \nnoise of the input buffer is fixed, the input referred noise of the VCA is a function of gain. The VCA input noise is designed to be a minimum when the gain is at a maximum, thereby optimizing the usable dynamic range of the device. A plot of wideband peak-to-peak output noise is shown in Figure 10. \n LEVEL DETECTOR \nThe SSM2166 incorporates a full-wave rectifier and true rms \nlevel detector circuit whose averaging time constant is set by \nan external capacitor connected to the AVG CAP pin (Pin 8). For optimal low frequency operation of the level detector \ndown to 10 Hz, the value of the capacitor must be 2.2 μF. Some \nexperimentation with larger values for the AVG CAP may be necessary to reduce the effects of excessive low frequency ambient background noise. The value of the averaging capacitor affects sound quality: too small a value for this capacitor may cause a pumping effect for some signals, while too large a value may \nresult in slow response times to signal dynamics. Electrolytic \ncapacitors are recommended for lowest cost and must be in the range of 2 μF to 47 μF. Capacitor values from 18 μF to 22 μF have been found to be more appropriate in voice-band applications where capacitors on the low end of the range seem more appropriate for music program material. \nThe rms detector filter time constant is approximately given by \n10 × C\nAVG milliseconds, where C AVG is in μF. This time constant \ncontrols both the steady-state averaging in the rms detector as \nwell as the release time for compression; that is, the time it takes for the system gain to react when a large input is followed by a small signal. The attack time, the time it takes for the gain to \nbe reduced when a small signal is followed by a large signal, is \ncontrolled partly by the AVG CAP value but is mainly controlled by internal circuitry that speeds up the attack for large level changes. \nThis limits overload time to less than 1 ms in most cases. \nBUFFER 1kΩ 1kΩBUF OUT VCA IN\nVOUTVCAR\n4 3 5 14\nRMS\nLEVEL\nDETECTORVCA\n1213\n9\n11SSM2166\nPOWER DOWN\nGND AVG CAP COMP\nRATIO SETGAIN ADJUSTOUTPUT\nNOISE GATE SET\nROTATION SET–IN\nAUDIO\n+IN\nC1\n0.1µF R2\n10kΩR1\n10kΩ\n1µF+C6\n10µF C7\n10µF (OPTIONAL)\n+ +\n+RCOMPCAVG\n2.2µFV+\n00357-0168 1012CONTROL\nCIRCUIT6\n7\nRGAIN\nRGATE\nRROT PTV+\n \nFigure 16.

As shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18, the attack time of the rms level detector is dependent only on C\nAVG, but the \nrelease times are linear ramps whose decay times are dependent on both C\nAVG and the input signal step size. The rate of release is \napproximately 240 dB/s for a C AVG of 2.2 μF and 12 dB/s for a \nCAVG of 22 μF. \n00357-017•••• •••• •••• •••• •••• •••• •••• •••• •••• ••••\n•••• •••• •••• •••• •••• •••• •••• •••• •••• ••••100mV\n100ms–6dBV\n–66dBV\n–85dBV100\n90\n10\n0%\n \nFigure 17.

RMS Level Detector Performance with C AVG = 22 μF \nCONTROL CIRCUITRY \nThe output of the rms level detector is a signal proportional to \nthe log of the true rms value of the buffer output with an added \ndc offset. The control circuitry subtracts a dc voltage from this \nsignal, scales it, and sends the result to the VCA to control the \ngain. The gain control of the VCA is logarithmic—a linear change in the control signal causes a decibel change in gain. It is this control law that allows linear processing of the log rms signal to provide the flat compression characteristic on the input/output \ncharacteristic shown in Figure 15. \n  Compression Ratio \nChanging the scaling of the control signal fed to the VCA causes a \nchange in the circuit compression ratio, r. This effect is shown \nin Figure 20. The compression ratio can be set by connecting a \nresistor between the COMP RATIO SET pin (Pin 10) and GND. Lowering R\nCOMP gives smaller compression ratios as shown in \nFigure 19, with values of approximately 0.17 kΩ or less resulting in a compression ratio of 1:1. AGC performance is achieved \nwith compression ratios between 2:1 and 15:1 and is dependent \non the application. A 100 kΩ potentiometer can be used to \nallow this parameter to be adjusted.  \n00357-031ROTATION POINT\n100mV rms300mV rms1V rms1:1\n0.10.10.12:1\n8.78.78.75:1\n19.419.419.410:1\n45454515:1\n395\nN/AN/A\nCOMPRESSION\nRATIO\n TYPICAL RCOMP VALUES IN k Ω. \nFigure 19.

Effect of Varying the Compression Ratio \nRotation Point \nAn internal dc reference voltage in the control circuitry, used to \nset the rotation point, is user specified, as illustrated in Figure 9. \nThe effect on rotation point is shown in Figure 21. By varying a resistor, R\nROT PT , connected between the positive supply and the \nROTATION SET pin (Pin 11), the rotation point may be varied by approximately 20 mV rms to 1 V rms. From Figure 21, the rotation point is inversely proportional to R\nROT PT . For example, a \n1 kΩ resistor typically sets the rotation point at 1 V rms, whereas a 55 kΩ resistor typically sets the rotation point at approximately 30 mV rms. \n \n    \nData Sheet SSM2166\n \nRev. F | Page 11 of 13 Because limiting occurs for signals larger than the rotation point \n(V IN > V RP), the rotation point effectively sets the maximum output \nsignal level. It is recommended that the rotation point be set at the upper extreme of the range of typical input signals so that \nthe compression region covers the entire desired input signal \nrange. Occasional larger signal transients are then attenuated by \nthe action of the limiter. \nVCA\nGAIN\nVCA\nGAIN\nVCA\nGAINOUTPUT (dB)\nINPUT (dB)VRP1r:1\n1\n1\n00357-020VDE VRP2 VRP3\n \nFigure 21.

Setting the VCA gain to its maximum can also be achieved by leaving the GAIN ADJUST pin in an open condition (no connect). Figure 22 illustrates the effect on the \ntransfer characteristic by varying this parameter.

Either a switch connected to ground or a transistor can be used, as shown in Figure 23. To avoid audible \nclicks when using the mute feature, a capacitor (C5) can be \nconnected from Pin 2 to GND. The value of the capacitor is arbitrary and must be determined empirically, but a 0.01 μF \ncapacitor is a good starting value. \n00357-022RGAINC5330Ω2\nGAIN ADJUSTSSM2166\nNOTES\n1.

Details of Mute Option \nDownward Expansion Threshold \nThe downward expansion threshold, or noise gate, is determined \nvia a second reference voltage internal to the control circuitry. \nThis second reference can be varied in the SSM2166 using a \nresistor, R GATE, connected between the positive supply and the \nNOISE GATE SET pin (Pin 9). The effect of varying this threshold \nis shown in Figure 24. The downward expansion threshold can be set between 300 μV rms and 20 mV rms by varying the \nresistance value between Pin 9 and the supply voltage. Like the \nROTATION SET pin, the downward expansion threshold is inversely proportional to the value of this resistance: setting this resistance to 1 MΩ sets the threshold at approximately 250 μV rms, whereas a 10 kΩ resistance sets the threshold at approximately 20 mV rms. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 5. In \ngeneral, the downward expansion threshold must be set at the \nlower extreme of the desired range of the input signals so that \nsignals below this level are attenuated. \nOUTPUT (dB)\nINPUT (dB)1\n1\nVRPVDE1r:1\nVCA GAIN\n00357-023VDE3VDE2\n \nFigure 24.

F | Page 12 of 13 POWER-DOWN FEATURE \nThe supply current of the SSM2166 can be reduced to less than \n100 μA by applying an active high, 5 V CMOS-compatible input \nto the POWER DOWN pin (Pin 12). In this state, the input and output circuitry of the SSM2166 assumes a high impedance \nstate; as such, the potentials at the input pin and the output pin are determined by the external circuitry connected to the SSM2166 . \nThe SSM2166 takes approximately 200 ms to settle from a power-\ndown to power-on command. For power-on to power-down, the SSM2166 requires more time, typically less than 1 second. \nCycling the power supply to the SSM2166 can result in quicker \nsettling times: the off-to-on settling time of the SSM2166 is less \nthan 200 ms, while the on-to-off settling time is less than 1 ms. \nIn either implementation, transients may appear at the output of the device. To avoid these output transients, use mute control of \nthe VCA gain as previously mentioned. \nPCB LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS \nBecause the SSM2166 is capable of wide bandwidth operation \nand can be configured for as much as 80 dB of gain, special care \nmust be exercised in the layout of the PCB that contains the IC \nand its associated components. The following recommendations \nmust be considered and/or followed: \n\uf0b7 In some high system gain applications, the shielding of input \nwires to minimize possible feedback from the output of the SSM2166 back to the input circuit may be necessary. \n\uf0b7 A single-point (star) ground implementation is recom-\nmended in addition to maintaining short lead lengths and \nPCB runs. In applications where an analog ground and a digital ground are available, the SSM2166 and its surrounding circuitry must be connected to the analog ground of the system. Because of these recommendations, wire-wrap \nboard connections and grounding implementations must \nbe avoided. \n\uf0b7 The internal buffer of the SSM2166 was designed to drive only \nthe input of the internal VCA and its own feedback network. Stray capacitive loading to ground from the BUF OUT pin in excess of 5 pF to 10 pF can cause excessive phase shift and \ncan lead to circuit instability. \uf0b7 When using high impedance sources (≥5 kΩ), system gains \nin excess of 60 dB are not recommended. This configuration is rarely appropriate because virtually all high impedance inputs provide larger amplitude signals that do not require \nas much amplification. When using high impedance sources, \nhowever, it can be advantageous to shunt the source with a capacitor to ground at the input pin of the IC (Pin 7) to lower the source impedance at high frequencies, as shown in Figure 25. A capacitor with a value of 1000 pF is a good starting value and sets a low-pass corner at 31 kHz for 5 kΩ \nsources. In applications where the source ground is not as \nclean as is desirable, a capacitor from the VCA\nR input to the \nsource ground may prove beneficial. This capacitor is used in addition to the grounded ca pacitor used in the feedback \naround the buffer, assuming that the buffer is configured \nfor gain. \n00357-024NOTES\n1.
