Internal metal electrodes are \nadded at each end and connected by a resistive paste that is applied to the top surface of the substrate. The \ncomposition of the paste is adju sted to give the approximate resistance required and the value is trimmed to \nwithin tolerance by laser cutting of this resistive layer.  \nThe resistive layer is covered with a protective coat. Finally, the two external end terminations are added. For \nease of  soldering the outer layer of these end terminations is a Tin (lead free)  alloy.  \n \n \nFig 1.

Therefore, it is possible to mount Surface Mount Resistors on one side of a PCB and other d iscrete \ncomponents on the reverse (mixed PCBs).  \nSurface Mount Resistors are tested for solderability at 235\uf0b0C during 2 seconds. The  test condition for no \nleaching is 260 \uf0b0C for 30 seconds. Typical examples of soldering processes that provide reliable joints  without \nany damage are given in Fig 3.  \n \nFig 3.

#### Description:
The WR06X8201FTL is a surface mount thick film resistor designed for general-purpose applications. It is constructed using a high-grade ceramic body (aluminum oxide) with internal metal electrodes connected by a resistive paste. The resistance value is finely tuned using laser cutting techniques to ensure precision within specified tolerances. The resistor is coated with a protective layer, and the terminations are made from a lead-free tin alloy for ease of soldering.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Consumer Electronics:** Used in various consumer electrical devices for current limiting and voltage division.
- **Computers and EDP (Electronic Data Processing):** Employed in circuit boards for signal processing and power management.
- **Telecommunications:** Utilized in telecom equipment for impedance matching and signal conditioning.

This component is ideal for applications requiring compact size, reliability, and compliance with environmental standards, making it suitable for modern electronic devices.
