Cautions regarding noise \nBe aware that when voltage is applied suddenly between the photocoupler’s input and output or between \ncollector-emitters at startup, the output transistor may enter the on state, even if the voltage is within the \nabsolute maximum ratings. \n \n3. Measurement conditions of current transfer ratios (CTR), which differ according to photocoupler \nCheck the setting values before use, since the forward current conditions at CTR measurement differ \naccording to product. \nWhen using products other than at the specified forward current, the characteristics curves may differ \nfrom the standard curves due to CTR value variations or the like. This tendency may sometimes be \nobvious, especially below I F = 1 mA. \nTherefore, check the characteristics under the actual operating conditions and thoroughly take variations \nor the like into consideration before use. \n \nUSAGE  CAUTIONS \n1.  Protect against static electricity when handling. \n2.  Avoid storage at a high temperature and high humidity. \n3.  Avoid cleaning with Freon based or halogen-based (chlorinated etc.) solvents.   \n4.
