These DACs provide low glitch energy, low noise, \ntight bipolar resistor matching, and high accuracy.  The DACs feature 1LSB INL (max, MAX5717A) accuracy and are guaranteed monotonic over the temperature range of \n-40°C to +105°C.  The offset and gai,n drift are low: ±0.1 \nppm /°C of FSR. Integrated precision setting resistors make the DACs easy to use in bipolar-output configurations.\nThe low-resistance DAC resistor network provides two \nimportant advantages over DACs that have higher-  \nresistance networks. First, the DAC\'s thermal noise, \nwhich is proportional to the square root of resistance, \nis lower than for higher-resistance DACs. Second, the \nDAC\'s settling time, which is directly proportional to the resistance, is lower than for other DACs. The DAC output  \nsettles in 750nS.\nOn power-up, the output resets to zero-scale (unipolar \nmode) providing additional safety for applications which drive valves or other transducers that need to be off \non power-up. The MAX5717 and MAX5719 feature a \n50MHz 3-wire SPI™, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP-\ncompatible serial interface.\nDigital Inputs and Interface LogicThe digital interface is based on a 3-wire standard that is \ncompatible with SPI, QSPI, and MICROWIRE interfaces. \nThe three digital inputs (CS, DIN, and SCLK) load the \ndigital input data serially into the DAC. LDAC updates the DAC output asynchronously.  All of the digital inputs \ninclude Schmitt-trigger buffers to accept slow-transition \ninterfaces. This means that optocouplers can interface \ndirectly to the DACs without additional external logic. The \ndigital inputs are compatible with CMOS-logic levels.\nSPI Interface\n16-Bit Interface (MAX5717)\nThe 16-Bit Serial Interface Timing Diagram shows the operation of the SPI interface. SCLK rising edges clock \nin the data on the DIN input. The CS low interval frames \nthe 16-cycle SPI instruction.  Qualified operations will be executed in response to the rising edge of CS.  \nOperations consisting of less than 16 SCLK cycles will \nnot be executed.  Operations consisting of more than 16 \nSCLK cycles will be executed using the first two bytes of \ndata available.  In order to abort a command sequence, the rise of CS must precede the 16\nth rising edge of SCLK. \nLDAC allows the DACD latch to update asynchronously, \nby pulling LDAC low after CS goes high.  Hold LDAC high \nduring the data loading sequence.\nTable 1. 16-Bit SPI Data Register\nFigure 1. 16-Bit Serial Interface Timing DiagramCLOCK EDGE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nDAC Register D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nDAC Data D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1D0\nLSB\nMSB LSB\nX D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 16tDHtDS tCP\ntCHtCL tCSS0\ntCSH0\ntCSPWtCSH1DIN\nSCLK\nCS\ntLDH\ntLDPWLDACX\nMAX5717/MAX5719 16 and 20-Bit Voltage DACs\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated │ 9\n20-Bit Interface (MAX5719)\nThe 20-Bit Serial Interface Timing Diagram shows the \noperation of the SPI interface. SCLK rising edges clock \nin the data on the DIN input. The CS low interval frames \nthe 24-cycle SPI instruction.  Qualified operations will be  \nexecuted in response to the rising edge of CS.  Operations consisting of less than 24 SCLK cycles will not be executed.  \nOperations consisting of more than 24 SCLK cycles will \nbe executed using the first 20 bits of data available. In order to abort a command sequence, the rise of CS must \nprecede the 24\nth rising edge of SCLK. LDAC allows the \nDACD latch to update asynchronously, by pulling LDAC \nlow after CS goes high.  Hold LDAC high during the data \nloading sequence.Throughput Rate\nThe throughput rate is dominated by the time required to load the DAC data and the time required for the inter-\nnal calibration circuitry to operate (referred to as "digital \nlatency"). At a 50MHz serial clock frequency, clocking the DAC data into the input register requires 20ns times the number of bits of resolution. Therefore, for a 20-bit DAC, \nthe data is clocked into the register in 400ns. The digital \nlatency is nominally 1210ns, with a maximum value of 1500ns. An additional 20ns is required for the CS minimum \npulse width, for a total throughput period of 1.92µs, as \nshown in the figure below.\nTable 2. 20-Bit SPI DAC Register Table\nFigure 2. 20-Bit Serial Interface Timing DiagramCLOCK \nEDGE1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\nDAC \nRegisterD23 D22 D21 D20 D19 D18 D17 D16 D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nDAC DataD19 \nMSBD18 D17 D16 D15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1D0 \nLSBX X X X\nMSB LSB\nX D14 D19 D18 D17 D15 D0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 20tDHtDS tCP\ntCLtCH tCSS0\ntCSH 0\ntCSPWDIN\nSCLK\nCS\ntLDH\ntLDPWLDAC21 23 24X X X\n22\ntCSH 1D16\nMAX5717/MAX5719 16 and 20-Bit Voltage DACs\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated │ 10\nWhen the falling-edge of LDAC occurs after the digital \nlatency period, the DAC output begins to change on the \nfalling-edge of LDAC. When the falling-edge of LDAC \noccurs before the end of the digital latency period, the DAC output begins to change at the end of the digital \nlatency period. Settling time is approximately 750ns, \nwhich means that the DAC will settle to value (N - 1) at \nsome point during the digital latency period for data (N).  \nThe DAC will begin to settle to value (N) on either the next falling-edge of LDAC (if LDAC goes low after the end of \nthe digital latency period) or at the end of the next digital latency period (if LDAC goes low before the end of the \ndigital latency period).\nPower-On Reset\nThe internal power-on reset circuit sets the DAC’s output to 0V in unipolar mode and -V\nREF in bipolar mode when \nVDD is first applied. This ensures that unexpected DAC \noutput voltages will not occur immediately following a \nsystem power-up, such as after a loss of power.Applications Information\nReference And Analog Ground Inputs\nApply an external voltage reference between the 4.0V \nand V DD to the reference inputs.  The reference voltage \ndetermines the DAC’s full-scale output voltage. Kelvin \nconnections are provided for optimum performance.\nSince these converters are designed as inverted R-2R \nvoltage-mode DACs, the input resistance seen by the voltage reference is code-dependent.  The worst-case \ninput resistance variation is from 2KΩ to 15KΩ.  The \nmaximum change in load current for a 4.096V reference is approximately 2mA. Therefore, when using a voltage \nreference with 10ppm/mA load regulation, the reference \nvoltage may change by around 20ppm across the full \nrange of input codes. Therefore, a buffer amplifier should \nbe used when the best INL performance is needed. In addition, the impedance of the path must be kept low \nbecause it contributes directly to the load regulation error. \nIf separate force and sense lines are not used, tie the appropriate force and sense pins together, close to the \npackage.\nFigure 3.

A 10µF low-ESR tantalum, film, or organic semiconductor capacitor works well for \nlow-frequency bypassing. The circuit can benefit from \neven larger bypassing capacitors, depending on the  \nstability of the external reference with capacitive loading.\nTo maintain the excellent accuracy of these high-performance \nDACs, the analog ground connection must be low impedance. \nConnect AGNDF and AGNDS to a star ground very close \nto the pins and with the lowest impedance possible. The \neffect of ground trace resistance may be eliminated by using a precision operational amplifier to drive AGNDF and force AGNDS to ground. A voltage reference with \na ground sense pin can also be used to control the \nDAC\'s reference voltage, provided that measurements are referred to AGNDS.\nAs in all high-resolution, high-accuracy applications, \nseparate analog and digital ground planes yield the best \nresults. Tie DGND to AGND at the AGND pin to form the \n“star” ground for the DAC system. Always refer remote \nDAC loads to this system ground for the best possible \nperformance.\nExternal Output Buffer Amplifier\nThe requirements on the external output buffer amplifier change whether the DAC is used in the unipolar or bipolar  \nmodes of operation. In unipolar mode, the output amplifier is used in a voltage-follower configuration. In bipolar mode, the amplifier operates with the internal scaling resistors \n(see Typical Application Circuits). In each mode, the \nDAC’s output impedance is constant and is independent of input code; however, the output amplifier’s input impedance \nshould still be as high as possible to minimize gain errors.  The DAC’s output capacitance is also independent of input code, thus simplifying stability requirements on the \nexternal amplifier.\nIn bipolar mode, a precision amplifier operating with dual \npower supplies (such as the MAX9632) provides the \n±V\nREF output range. In single-supply applications, preci-\nsion amplifiers with input common-mode ranges including \nAGND are available. However, their output swings do \nnot normally include the negative rail (AGND) without significant degradation of performance. A single-supply \namplifier may be suitable if the application does not use \ncodes near zero.\nSince the LSBs for high-resolution DACs are extremely \nsmall, pay close attention to the external amplifier’s input \nspecifications. The input offset voltage can degrade the \nzero scale error and might require an output offset trim to \nmaintain full accuracy if the offset voltage is greater than ½ LSB. Similarly, the input bias current, multiplied by the \nDAC output resistance (2KΩ, typ), contributes to the zero-\nscale error. Temperature drift of offset voltage and input bias current must also be taken into account.\nThe settling time is affected by the buffer input capacitance,  \nthe DAC’s output capacitance, and the PC board capacitance. \nThe typical DAC output voltage settling time to ±1ppm is 750ns for a full-scale step. Settling time can be signifi -\ncantly less for smaller step changes. Assuming a single time constant exponential settling response, a full scale \nstep takes about 13.8 time constants to settle to within \n±1ppm of the final output voltage. The time constant is equal to the DAC output resistance multiplied by the total \noutput capacitance. Any additional output capacitance, \nsuch as the buffer\'s input capacitance, will increase the settling time.\nMAX5717/MAX5719 16 and 20-Bit Voltage DACs\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated │ 12\nThe external buffer amplifier’s gain-bandwidth product is \nimportant because it increases the settling time by adding  \nanother time constant to the output response. The  \neffective time constant of two cascaded systems, each with a single time constant response, is approximately \nthe square root of the sum of the two time constants.  The \nDAC output’s time constant (due to internal resistance \nand capacitance) is about 50ns, ignoring the effect of \nadditional capacitance. If the time constant of an external amplifier with 10MHz bandwidth is\n1/(2π x 10MHz) = 15.9ns,\nthen the effective time constant of the combined system is:\n[50ns\n2  + 15.9ns 2 ] ½  ≈ 52.5nsThis suggests that the settling time to within  ±1ppm of the final output voltage, including the external buffer amplifier, \nwill be approximately\n13.8 x 52.5ns = 724ns.\nUnipolar Configuration\nFigure 4 shows the MAX5717/MAX5719 configured for \nunipolar operation with an external op amp. The op amp is \nset for unity gain, and the tables below list the codes and \ncorresponding output voltages for this circuit when using the 16-bit MAX5717 or the 20-bit MAX5719.
