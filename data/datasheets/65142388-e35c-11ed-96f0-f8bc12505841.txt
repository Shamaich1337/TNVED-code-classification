All of the products in the HSMS-280x family use the same diode chip, and the same is true of the HSMS-281x and HSMS-282x families. Each family has a dif-ferent set of characteristics which can be compared most easily by consulting the SPICE parameters in Table 1.\nA review of these data shows that the HSMS-280x family \nhas the highest breakdown voltage, but at the expense of a high value of series resistance (R\ns). In applications which \ndo not require high voltage the HSMS-282x family, with a lower value of series resistance, will offer higher current carrying capacity and better performance. The HSMS-281x family is a hybrid Schottky (as is the HSMS-280x), offering lower 1/f or flicker noise than the HSMS-282x family.\nIn general, the HSMS-282x family should be the designer’s \nfirst choice, with the -280x family reserved for high voltage applications and the HSMS-281x family for low flicker noise applications.\nAssembly Instructions\nSOT-323 PCB Footprint\nA recommended PCB pad layout for the miniature SOT-\n323 (SC-70) package is shown in Figure 6 (dimensions are in inches).

Components with a low mass, such as the SOT package, will reach solder reflow temperatures faster than those with a greater mass. \nAvago’s SOT diodes have been qualified to the time-temperature profile shown in Figure 8. This profile is representative of an IR reflow type of surface mount as-sembly process.\nAfter ramping up from room temperature, the circuit \nboard with components attached to it (held in place with solder paste) passes through one or more preheat zones. The preheat zones increase the temperature of the \nboard and components to prevent thermal shock and begin evaporating solvents from the solder paste. The reflow zone briefly elevates the temperature sufficiently to produce a reflow of the solder. \nThe rates of change of temperature for the ramp-up and \ncool-down zones are chosen to be low enough to not cause deformation of the board or damage to compo-nents due to thermal shock. The maximum temperature in the reflow zone (T\nMAX) should not exceed 260°C. \nThese parameters are typical for a surface mount assem-\nbly process for Avago diodes. As a general guideline, the circuit board and components should be  exposed only to the minimum temperatures and times necessary to achieve a uniform reflow of solder. \n7Package Dimensions\nOutline 23 (SOT-23) Outline SOT-323 (SC-70 3 Lead)Part Number Ordering Information\nPart NumberNo. of\nDevices Container\nHSMS-280x-TR2G 10000 13” Reel\nHSMS-280x-TR1G 3000 7” ReelHSMS-280x-BLKG 100 antistatic bag\nx = 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, B, C, E, F, K, L, M, N, P , R\ne\nBe2\ne1\nE1\nCEXXX\nL\nD\nA\nA1\nNotes:\nXXX-package  mar king\nDrawings  are not to scaleDIMENSIONS ( mm )\nMIN.\n0.79\n0.000\n0.30\n0.08\n2.731.15\n0.891.78\n0.452.10\n0.45MAX.\n1.20\n0.100\n0.540.203.13\n1.50\n1.02\n2.040.60\n2.70\n0.69SYMBOL\nA\nA1\nB\nC\nD\nE1\ne\ne1\ne2\nE\nLe\nBe1\nE1\nCEXXX\nL\nD\nA\nA1\nNotes:\nXXX-package  mar king\nDrawings  are not to scaleDIMENSIONS ( mm )\nMIN.\n0.800.000.15\n0.081.80\n1.10\n1.80\n0.26MAX.\n1.00\n0.10\n0.40\n0.252.251.40\n2.40\n0.46SYMBOL\nA\nA1\nB\nC\nD\nE1\ne\ne1\nE\nL\n1.30 typica l0.65  typica l\n8USER\nFEED DIRECTION\nCOVER TAPECARRIER\nTAPE REEL \nNote: "AB" represents package marking code.\n           "C" represents date code.END VIEW\n8 mm4 mmTOP VIEWABC ABC ABC ABCNote: "AB" represents package marking code.\n           "C" represents date code.END VIEW\n8 mm4 mmTOP VIEW\nABC ABC ABC ABC\nEND VIEW\n8 mm4 mmTOP VIEW\nNote: "AB" represents package marking code.\n           "C" represents date code.ABC ABC ABC ABCDevice Orientation\nFor Outline SOT-143For Outlines SOT-23, -323\nFor Outline SOT-363Outline 143 (SOT-143) Outline SOT-363 (SC-70 6 Lead)Package Dimensions (Continued)\neBe2\nB1e1\nE1\nCEXXX\nL\nD\nA\nA1\nNotes:\nXXX-package  mar king\nDrawings  are not to scaleDIMENSIONS ( mm )\nMIN.\n0.79\n0.013\n0.36\n0.76\n0.086\n2.80\n1.20\n0.89\n1.78\n0.45\n2.10\n0.45MAX.\n1.097\n0.10\n0.540.92\n0.152\n3.061.40\n1.02\n2.040.60\n2.65\n0.69SYMBOL\nA\nA1\nB\nB1\nC\nD\nE1\ne\ne1\ne2\nE\nLE HE\nDe\nA1\nbA A2\nLcDIMENSIONS ( mm )\nMIN.\n1.15\n1.80\n1.80\n0.800.800.00\n0.15\n0.080.10MAX.\n1.35\n2.252.401.10\n1.00\n0.10\n0.30\n0.250.46SYMBOL\nE\nD\nHE\nA\nA2\nA1\ne\nb\nc\nL\n0.650  BCS\n9Tape Dimensions and Product Orientation \nFor Outline SOT-23\nFor Outline SOT-1439° MAX\nA0P\nP0D P2\nE\nF\nW\nD1\nKo 8° MAX\nB013.5° MAXt1\nDESCRIPTION SYMBOL SIZE (mm) SIZE (INCHES)\nLENGTH\nWIDTHDEPTH\nPITCH\nBOTTOM HOLE DIAMETERA\n0\nB0\nK0\nP\nD13.15 ± 0.10\n2.77 ± 0.10\n1.22 ± 0.10\n4.00 ± 0.10\n1.00  + 0.050.124 ± 0.004\n0.109 ± 0.004\n0.048 ± 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.039 ± 0.002CAVITY\nDIAMETERPITCH\nPOSITIOND\nP\n0\nE1.50 + 0.10\n4.00 ± 0.10\n1.75 ± 0.100.059 + 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.069 ± 0.004PERFORATION\nWIDTH\nTHICKNESSW\nt18.00 +  0.30 - 0.10\n0.229 ± 0.0130.315 +  0.012 - 0.004\n0.009 ± 0.0005CARRIER TAPE\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(WIDTH DIRECTION)\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(LENGTH DIRECTION)F\nP23.50 ± 0.05\n2.00 ± 0.050.138 ± 0.002\n0.079 ± 0.002DISTANCE\nBETWEEN\nCENTERLINE\nWFEP2P0DP\nD1\nDESCRIPTION SYMBOL SIZE (mm) SIZE (INCHES)\nLENGTH\nWIDTH\nDEPTH\nPITCH\nBOTTOM HOLE DIAMETERA0\nB0\nK0\nP\nD13.19 ± 0.10\n2.80 ± 0.10\n1.31 ± 0.10\n4.00 ± 0.10\n1.00  + 0.250.126 ± 0.004\n0.110 ± 0.004\n0.052 ± 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.039 +  0.010CAVITY\nDIAMETERPITCHPOSITIOND\nP\n0\nE1.50 + 0.10\n4.00 ± 0.10\n1.75 ± 0.100.059 + 0.004\n0.157 ± 0.004\n0.069 ± 0.004PERFORATION\nWIDTH\nTHICKNESSW\nt18.00 +  0.30 - 0.10\n0.254 ± 0.0130.315+  0.012 - 0.004\n0.0100 ± 0.0005CARRIER TAPE\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(WIDTH DIRECTION)\nCAVITY TO PERFORATION\n(LENGTH DIRECTION)F\nP23.50 ± 0.05\n2.00 ± 0.050.138 ± 0.002\n0.079 ± 0.002DISTANCEA09° MAX 9 ° MAXt1\nB0K0\nTape Dimensions and Product Orientation \nFor Outlines SOT-323, -363\nFor product information and a complete list of distributors, please go to our web site:         www.avagotech.com\nAvago, Avago Technologies, and the A logo are trademarks of Avago Technologies in the United States and other countries.Data subject to change.
