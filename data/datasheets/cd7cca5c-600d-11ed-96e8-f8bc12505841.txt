D | Page 3  of 25 GENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe AD9951 is a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) featuring a  \n14-bit DAC operating up to 400 MSPS. The AD9951 uses \nadvanced DDS technology, coupled with an internal high speed, \nhigh performance DAC to form a digitally programmable, complete high frequency synthesizer capable of generating a frequency -agile analog output sinusoidal waveform at up to \n200 MHz.  The AD9951 is designed to provide fast frequency hopping and fine tuning resolution (32 -bit frequency tuning \nword). The frequency tuning and control words are loaded into the AD9951 via a serial I/O port.  \nThe AD9951 is specified to operate over the extended industrial \ntemperature range of − 40°C to +105°C.  \n \nAD9951 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

Reducing the clock input amplitude reduces the phase noise \nperformance of the device.  \n2 Wake -up time refers to the recovery from analog power -down modes (see th e Power -Down Functions of the  section). The longest time required is for the reference \nclock multiplier PLL to relock to the reference. The wake- up time assumes there is no capacitor on DACBP and that the recommended PLL loop filter values are used.  \n3 SYSCLK cycle refers to the actual clock frequency used on -chip by the DDS. If the reference clock multiplier is used to multiply the external reference clock frequency, \nthe SYSCLK frequency is the external frequency multiplied by the reference clock multiplication factor. If the reference clock mu ltiplier is not used, the SYSCLK \nfrequency is the same as the external reference clock frequency.  \n4 SYNC_CLK = ¼ SYSCLK rate. For SYNC_CLK rates ≥ 50 MHz, the high speed sync enable bit, CFR2<11>, should be set.  \n5 This parameter indicates that the digital synchronization feature cannot overcome phase delays (timing skew) between system clock rising edges. If the system clock \nedges are aligned, the synchronization function should not increase the skew between the two edges.  \n \nAD9951  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

D | Page 12 of 25 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCOMPONENT BLOCKS  \nDDS Core  \nThe output frequency ( fO) of the DDS is a function of the \nfrequency of the system clock (SYSCLK), the value of the \nfrequency tuning word ( FTW ), and the capacity of the \naccumulator (232, in this case). The exact relationship is given \nbelow with fS defined as the frequency of SYSCLK.  \n()()31 322 0 2/ ≤≤ = FTW with f FTW fS O  \n() ( ) 1–2 2 2/ –132 31 32<< ×= FTW with FTW f fS O  \nThe value at the output of the phase accumulator is translated to \nan amplitude value via the COS(x) functional block and routed \nto the DAC.  \nIn certain applications, it is desirable to force the output signal to zero phase. Simply setting the FTW to 0 does not accomplish this; it only results in the DDS core holding its current phase value. Thus, a control bit is required to force the phase accumulator output to zero.  \nAt power -up, the  clear phase accumulator bit is set to Logic 1, \nbut the bu ffer memory for this bit is cleared (Logic 0). Therefore, \nupon powe r-up, the phase accumulator  remain s clear until the \nfirst I/O UPDATE is issued.  \nPhase -Locked Loop (PLL)  \nThe PLL allows multiplicati on of the REFCLK frequency. \nControl of the PLL is accomplished by programming the 5 -bit \nREFCLK multiplier portion of Control Function Register No. 2, Bits <7:3>.  \nWhen programmed for values ranging from 0x04 to 0x14  \n(4 de cimal to 20 decimal), the PLL multi plies the REFCLK inpu t \nfrequency by the corresponding decimal value. However, the maximum output frequency of the PLL  is restricted to 400 MHz.  \nWhenever the PLL value is changed, the user should be aware that time must be allocated to allow the PLL to lock  (approximately  \n1 ms).  \nThe PLL is bypassed by programming a value outside the range of 4 to 20 (decimal). When bypassed, the PLL is shut down to conserve power.  Clock Input  \nThe AD9951 supports various clock methodologies. Support for \ndifferential or single -ended input clocks and enabling of an on-chip \noscillator and/or a phase -locked loop (PLL) multiplier are \ncontrolle d via user programmable bits. The AD9951 can be config -\nured in one of six operating modes to generate the system  clock. \nThe modes are configured using the CLKMODESELECT pin, CFR1<4>, and CFR2<7:3>. Note that the CLKMODESELECT pin  \nconforms to 1.8 V logic levels, on ly. Connecting the external pin \nCLKMODESELECT to Logic High enables the on -chip crystal \noscillator circuit. With the on -chip oscillator enabled, users of \nthe AD9951 connect an external crystal to the REFCLK and \nREFCLKB inputs to produce a low frequency reference clock in the range of 20 MHz to 30 MHz. The signal generated by the oscillator is buffered before it is delivered to the rest of the chip. This buffered signal is available via the CRYSTAL OUT pin. \nBit CFR1<4> can be used to enable or disable the buffer,  turning \non or off the system clock. The oscillator itself is not powered \ndown in order to avoid long startup times associated with  turning \non a crystal oscillator. Writing CFR2<9> to Logic H igh enables \nthe crystal oscillator output buffer. Logic Low at CFR2<9> disables the oscillator output buffer.  \nConnecting CLKMODESELECT to Logic Low disables the \non-chip oscillator and the oscillator output buffer. With the \noscillator disabled, an external oscillator must provide the \nREFCLK and/or REFCLKB signals. For differential operation, these pins are driven with complementary signals. For single -\nended  operation, a 0.1 µF capacitor should be connected between  \nthe unused pin and the analog power supply. With the capacitor in place, the clock input pin bias voltage is 1.35 V . In addition, \nthe PLL may be used to multiply the reference frequency by an \ninteger value in the range of 4 to 20. Table 4 summarizes the clock \nmodes of operation. Note that the PLL multiplier is controlled \nvia the CFR2<7:3> bits, independent of the CFR1<4> bit.  \nTable 4.Clock Input Modes of Operation  \nCFR1<4>  CLKMODESELECT CFR2<7:3>  Oscillator Enabled  System Clock  Frequency Range (MHz)  \nLow  High  3 < M < 21  Yes FCLK = F OSC × M  80 < F CLK < 400 \nLow  High  M < 4 or M > 20  Yes FCLK = F OSC 20 < F CLK < 30 \nLow  Low  3 < M < 21  No FCLK = F OSC × M  80 < F CLK < 400 \nLow  Low  M < 4 or M > 20  No FCLK = F OSC 10 < F CLK < 400 \nHigh  X X No FCLK = 0 N/A  \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD9951  \n \nRev. D | Page 13 of 25 DAC Output  \nThe AD9951 incorporates an integrated 14 -bit current output \nDAC. Unlike most DACs, this output is referenced to AVDD, \nnot AGND.  \nTwo complementary outputs provide a combined full -scale \noutput current (I OUT). Differential outputs reduce the amount of \ncommon -mode nois e that may  be present at the DAC output, \noffering the advantage of an increased signal -to-noise ratio. The \nfull-scale current is controlled by an external resistor (R SET) \nconnected between the DAC_R SET pin and the DAC ground \n(AGND_DAC). The full -scale curr ent is proportional to the \nresistor value as follows:  \nOUT SET I R /19.39=  \nThe maximum full -scale output current of the combined DAC \noutputs is 15 mA, but limiting the output to 10 mA provides the \nbest spurious -free dynamic range (SFDR) performance. The DAC \noutput compliance range is AVDD + 0.5 V to AVDD −  0.5 V .  \nVoltages develo ped beyond this range  cause excessive DAC \ndistortion and can potentially damage the DAC output circuitry. \nPay proper attention  to the load termination to keep the output \nvoltage within this compliance range.  Serial I /O Port  \nThe AD9951 serial port is a flexible, synchronous serial commu -\nnications port that allows easy interface to many industry -standard  \nmicrocontrollers and microprocessors. The serial I/O port is compatible with most synchronous transfer formats, including \nboth the Motorola 6905/11 SPI and Intel 8051 SSR protocols.  \nThe interface allows read/write access to all registers that configure \nthe AD9951. MSB first or LSB first transfer formats are supported. \nThe AD9951 serial interface port can be configured as a single pin \nI/O (SDIO), which allows a 2 -wire interface or two unidirectional  \npins for in/out (SDIO/SDO), which in turn enables a 3 -wire \ninterface. Two optional pins, IOSYNC and \nCS, enable greater \nflexibility for system design in the AD9951. \nRegister Map and Descriptions  \nThe register map is listed in Table 5. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAD9951  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

D | Page 17 of 25 Other Register Descriptions  \nAmplitude Scale Factor (ASF)  \nThe ASF register stores the 2 -bit auto ramp rate speed value and \nthe 14 -bit amplitude scale factor used in the output shaped \nkeying (OSK) operation. In auto OSK operation, ASF <15:14> \ntells the OSK block how many amplitude steps to take for each \nincrement or d ecrement. ASF<13:0> sets the maximum value \nachievable by the OSK internal multiplier. In manual OSK \nmode, ASF<15:14> has no effect. ASF <13:0> provide the output scale factor directly. If the OSK enable bit is cleared, CFR1<25> = 0, this register has no ef fect on device operation.  \nAmplitude Ramp Rate (ARR) \nThe ARR register stores the 8 -bit amplitude ramp rate used in \nthe auto OSK mode. This register programs the rate at which the amplitude scale factor counter increments or decrements. If the OSK is set to manual mode, or if OSK enable is cleared, this register has no effect on device operation.  \nFrequency Tuning Word 0 (FTW0)  \nThe frequency tuning word is a 32 -bit register that controls the \nrate of accumulation in the phase accumulator of the DDS core. Its sp ecific role is dependent on the device mode of operation.  \nPhase Offset Word (POW)  \nThe phase offset word is a 14 -bit register that stores a phase \noffset value. This offset value is added to the output of the phase accumulator to offset the current phase of the output signal. The \nexact value of phase offset is given by the following formula:  \n°×\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb=Φ 360214POW \nMODES OF OPERATION  \nSingle -Tone Mode  \nIn single -tone mode, the DDS core uses a single tuning word. \nWhatever value is stored in FTW0 is supplied to the phase accumulator. This value can only be changed manually, which is \ndone by writing a new value to FTW0 and by issuing an I/O  \nUPDATE. Phase adjustment is possible through the phase  \noffset register.  \nPROGRAMMING AD9951 FEATURES  \nPhase Offset Control  \nA 14 -bit phase offset  (θ) may be added to the output of the phase \naccumulator by means of the control registers. This feature \nprovides the user with two differen t methods of phase control.  \nThe first method is a static phase adjustment, where a fixed phase offset is loaded into the appropriate phase offset register and left unchanged. The result is that the output signal is offset \nby a constant angle relative to th e nominal signal. This allows \nthe user to phase align the DDS output with some external  \nsignal, if necessary.  \n The second method of phase control is where the user regularly \nupdates the phase offset register via the I/O port. By properly \nmodifying the pha se offset as a function of time, the user can \nimplement a phase modulated output signal. However, both the speed of the I/O port and the frequency of SYSCLK limit the rate at which phase modulation can be performed.  \nThe AD9951 allows for a programmable continuous zeroing of \nthe phase accumulator as well as a clear and release or auto -\nmatic zeroing function. Each feature is individually controlled \nvia the CFR1 bits. CFR1<13> is the automatic clear phase \naccumulator bit. CFR1<10> clears the phase accumulator and \nholds the value to zero.  \nContinuous Clear Bit  \nThe continuous clear bit is simply a static control signal that, when active high, holds the phase accumulator at zero for the entire time the bi t is active. When the bit goes low, inactive, the \nphase accumulator is allowed to operate.  \nClear and Release Function  \nWhen set, the auto -clear phase accumulator clears and releases \nthe phase accumulator upon receiving an I/O UPDATE. The automatic clearing  function is repeated for every subsequent \nI/O UPDATE until the appropriate auto -clear control bit is \ncleared.  \nShaped On -Off Keying  \nThe shaped on -off keying function of the AD9951 allows the \nuser to control the ramp -up and ramp -down time of an on -off \nemission from the DAC. This function is used in burst  transmis -\nsions of digital data to reduce the adverse spectral impact of \nshort, abrupt bursts of data.  \nAuto and manual shaped on -off keying modes are supported. \nThe auto mode generates a linear scale factor at a rate deter -\nmined by the amplitude ramp rate (ARR) register controlled by \nan external pin (OSK). Manual mode allows the user to directly control the output amplitude by writing  the scale factor value \ninto the amplitude scale factor (ASF) register.  \nThe shaped on -off keying function may be bypassed (disabled) \nby clearing the OSK enable bit (CFR1<25> = 0).  \nThe modes are controlled by two bits located in the most  signifi -\ncant byte o f the control function register (CFR). CFR1<25> is \nthe shaped on -off keying enable bit. When CFR1<25> is set, the \noutput scaling function is enabled and CFR1<25> bypasses the \nfunction. CFR1<24> is the internal shaped on -off keying active \nbit. When CFR1<24>  is set, internal shaped on -off keying mode \nis active; CFR1<24> is cleared, external shaped on -off keying \nmode is active. CFR1<24> is a Don’t Care if the shaped on -off \nkeying enable bit (CFR1<25>) is cleared. The power up  condition \nis shaped on -off keying disabled (CFR1<25> = 0). Figure 18 \nshows the block diagram of the OSK circuitry.  \n \nAD9951 Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 18 of 25 AUTO Shaped On-Off Keying Mode Operation \nThe auto shaped on-off keying mode is active when CFR1<25> \nand CFR1<24> are set. When auto shaped on-off keying mode \nis enabled, a single scale factor is internally generated and  \napplied to the multiplier input for scaling the output of the DDS core block (see Figure 18). The scale factor is the output of a  14-bit counter that increments/decrements at a rate determined by the contents of the 8-bit output ramp rate register. The scale \nfactor increases if the OSK pin is high and decreases if the OSK \npin is low. The scale factor is an unsigned value such that all 0s multiply the DDS core output by 0 (decimal) and 0x3FFF \nmultiplies the DDS core output by 16383 (decimal). \nFor those users who use the full amplitude (14-bits) but need \nfast ramp rates, the internally generated scale factor step size  is controlled via the ASF<15:14> bits. Table 6 describes the  \nincrement/decrement step size of the internally generated scale \nfactor per the ASF<15:14> bits. \nA special feature of this mode is that the maximum output  \namplitude allowed is limited by the contents of the amplitude scale factor register. This allows the user to ramp to a value less \nthan full scale.  \nTable 6. Auto-Scale Factor Internal Step Size \nASF<15:14> (Binary) Increment/Decrement Size \n00 1 \n01 2 \n10 4 \n11 8 \n OSK Ramp Rate Timer \nThe OSK ramp rate timer is a loadable down counter, which \ngenerates the clock signal to the 14-bit counter that generates \nthe internal scale factor. The ramp rate timer is loaded with the \nvalue of the ASFR every time the counter reaches 1 (decimal). This load and countdown operation continues for as long as the timer is enabled, unless the timer is forced to load before \nreaching a count of 1.  \nIf the load OSK timer bit (CFR1<26>) is set, the ramp rate \ntimer is loaded upon an I/O UPDATE or upon reaching a value \nof 1. The ramp timer can be loaded before reaching a count of 1 \nby three methods.  \nMethod one is by changing the OSK input pin. When the OSK \ninput pin changes state, the ASFR value is loaded into the ramp \nrate timer, which then proceeds to count down as normal. \nThe second method in which the sweep ramp rate timer can be \nloaded before reaching a count of 1 is if the load OSK timer bit \n(CFR1<26>) is set and an I/O UPDATE is issued. \nThe last method in which the sweep ramp rate timer can be \nloaded before reaching a count of 1 is when going from the \ninactive auto shaped on-off keying mode to the active auto \nshaped on-off keying mode; that is, when the sweep enable bit is \nbeing set. \n03359-005OSK PINLOAD OSK TIMER\nCFR1<26>SYNC_CLKAUTO DESK\nENABLE\nCFR1<24>TO DAC\nAUTO SCALE\nFACTOR GENERATORRAMP RATE TIMERCLOCKDDS CORE\nOSK ENABLE\nCFR<25>\nAMPLITUDE SCALE\nFACTOR REGISTER\n(ASF)0\n01 0101\nHOLD\nINC/DEC ENABLEOUTCOS(X)\nAMPLITUDE RAMP\nRATE REGISTER\n(ASF)\nUP/DN DATA LOAD\nEN\n \nFigure 18.

D | Page 19 of 25 External Shaped On-Off Keying Mode Operation \nThe external shaped on-off keying mode is enabled by writing \nCFR1<25> to a Logic 1 and writing CFR1<24> to a Logic 0. \nWhen configured for external shaped on-off keying, the content \nof the ASFR becomes the scale factor for the data path. The scale factors are synchronized to SYNC_CLK via the  \nI/O UPDATE functionality. \nSynchronization; Register Updates (I/O UPDATE) \nFunctionality of the SYNC_CLK and I/O UPDATE \nData into the AD9951 is synchronous to the SYNC_CLK signal \n(supplied externally to the user on the SYNC_CLK pin). The \nI/O UPDATE pin is sampled on the rising edge of the \nSYNC_CLK. \nInternally, SYSCLK is fed to a divide-by-4 frequency divider to \nproduce the SYNC_CLK signal. The SYNC_CLK signal is provided to the user on the SYNC_CLK pin. This enables synchronization of the external hardware with the internal \nclocks of the device. This is accomplished by forcing any \nexternal hardware to obtain its timing from SYNC_CLK. The I/O UPDATE signal coupled wi th SYNC_CLK is used to \ntransfer internal buffer contents into the control registers of the device. The combination of the SYNC_CLK and I/O UPDATE pins provides the user with constant latency relative to SYSCLK, \nand also ensures phase continuity of the analog output signal \nwhen a new tuning word or phase offset value is asserted. Figure 19 demonstrates an I/O UPDATE timing cycle and \nsynchronization. \nNotes to synchronization logic: \n1.\n The I/O UPDATE signal is edge detected to generate a \nsingle rising edge clock signal that drives the register bank flops. The I/O UPDATE signal has no constraints on duty cycle. The minimum low time on I/O UPDATE is one \nSYNC_CLK clock cycle. \n2.\n The I/O UPDATE pin is set up and held around the rising \nedge of SYNC_CLK and has zero  hold time and 4 ns setup \ntime. \n \n \n \n03359-006SYSCLK\nSDISYNC_CLK\nDISABLE100\nSCLKTO CORE LOGIC\nCSOSK\nD\nQD\nQI/O UPDATE\nD\nQ÷ 4\nSYNC_CLK\nGATINGEDGE\nDETECTION\nLOGIC\nREGISTER\nMEMORYI/O BUFFER\nLATCHES\n \nFigure 19.

I/O Synchronization Timing Diagram  \nSynchronizing Multiple  AD9951 Devices  \nThe AD9951 product allows easy synchronization of multiple \nAD9951 devices . There are three modes of synchronization \navailable to the user: an automatic synchronization mode, a \nsoftware controlled manual synchronization mode, and a \nhardware controlled manual synchronization mode. In all cases, when a user wants to sy nchronize two or more devices, the \nfollowing considerations must be observed. First, all units must share a c ommon clock source. Trace lengths and path impedance  \nof the clock tree must be designed to keep the phase delay of the \ndifferent clock branches as closely matched as possible. Second, \nthe rising edge of the  I/O UPDATE signal must be provided  \nsynchronously to all devices in the system. Finally, regardless of the internal synchronization method used, the DVDD_I/O supply should be set to 3.3 V for all d evices that are to be \nsynchronized. AVDD and DVDD should be left at 1.8 V . \nIn automatic synchronization mode, one device is chosen as a \nmaster; the other device(s) are  slaved to this master. When \nconfigured in this mode, the slaves automatically synchroniz e \ntheir internal clocks to the SYNC_CLK output signal of the \nmaster device. To enter automatic synchronizat ion mode, set \nthe automatic synchronization bit (CFR1<23> = 1)  of the slave \ndevice . Con nect the SYNC_IN input(s) to the master SYNC_C LK \noutput. The slave device  continuously update s the phase \nrelationship of its SYNC_CLK until it is in phase with the \nSYNC_IN input, which is the SYNC_CLK of the master device. When attempting to synchronize devices running at SYSCLK speeds beyond 250 MSPS, the high speed sync enhancement enable bit should be set (CFR2<11> = 1).  \nIn software manual synchronization mode, the user forces the \ndevice to advance the SYNC_CLK rising edge one SYSCLK \ncycle (1/4 SYNC_CLK period). To activate the manual \nsynchronization  mode, set the software manual s ynchronization \nbit (CFR1<22> = 1)  of the slave device. The bit (CFR1<22>) is \ncleared  immediately. To advance the rising edge of the SYNC_CLK \nmulti ple times, this bit  need s to be set multiple times.  \n \n In hardware manual synch ronization mode, the SYNC_IN  \ninput pin is configured such that it advances  the rising edge of \nthe SYNC_CLK signal each time the device detects a rising edge \non the SYNC_IN p in. To put the device into hard ware manual \nsynchronization mode, set the hardware manual synchronization  \nbit (CFR2<10> = 1). Unlike the software manual synchronization  \nbit, this bit does not self -clear. Once the hardware manual \nsynchronization mode is enabled, all rising edges detected on \nthe SYNC_IN input causes  the device to advance t he rising edge \nof the SYNC_CLK by one SYSCLK cycle until this enable bit is \ncleared (CFR2<10> = 0).  \nUsing a Single Crystal to Drive Multiple AD9951 Clock \nInputs  \nThe AD9951 crystal oscillator output signal is available on the \nCRYSTAL OUT pin, enabling one crystal to drive multiple AD9951 devices . To drive multiple AD9951 devices  with one \ncrystal, the CRYSTAL OUT pin of the AD9951 using the external \ncrystal should be connected to the REFCLK input of the other AD9951.  \nThe CRYSTAL OUT pin is static until the CFR2<9> bit is set, \nenabling the output. The drive strength of the CRYSTAL OUT \npin is typically very low, so this signal should be buffered prior to using it to drive any loads.  \nSERIAL PORT OPERATIO N \nWith the AD9951, the instruction byte specifies read/write \noperation and register address. Serial operations on the AD9951 occur only at the register level, not the byte level. For the AD9951, the serial port controller recognizes the instruction byte register address and automatic ally generates the proper \nregister byte address. In addition, the controller expects that all bytes of that register are accessed. It is a required that all bytes \nof a register be accessed during serial I/O operations, with one \nexception. The IOSYNC functi on can be used to abort an I/O \noperation, thereby allowing less than all bytes to be accessed.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet AD9951\n \nRev. D | Page 21 of 25 There are two phases to a communication cycle with the \nAD9951. Phase 1 is the instruction cycle, which is the writing of an instruction byte into the AD9951, coincident with the first \neight SCLK rising edges. The instruction byte provides the \nAD9951 serial port controller with information regarding the \ndata transfer cycle, which is Phase 2 of the communication cycle. The Phase 1 instruction byte defines whether the upcoming data transfer is read or write and the serial address of the register \nbeing accessed.  \nThe first eight SCLK rising edges of each communication cycle \nare used to write the instruction byte into the AD9951. The \nremaining SCLK edges are for Phase 2 of the communication cycle. Phase 2 is the actual data transfer between the AD9951 \nand the system controller. The number of bytes transferred  during Phase 2 of the communication cycle is a function of the register being accessed. For example, when accessing the Control Function Register No. 2, which is three bytes wide, Phase 2 requires that three bytes be transferred. If accessing the frequency tuning \nword, which is four bytes wide, Phase 2 requires that four bytes \nbe transferred. After transferring all data bytes per the instruc-\ntion, the communication cycle is completed. \nAt the completion of any communication cycle, the AD9951 \nserial port controller expects the next eight rising SCLK edges \nto be the instruction byte of the next communication cycle. All data input to the AD9951 is registered on the rising edge of \nSCLK. All data is driven out of the AD9951 on the falling edge \nof SCLK. Figure 21 through Figure 24 are useful in understand-\ning the general operation of the AD9951 serial port. \n \n03359-008I6 I5 I4 I3 I2 I1 D5 D4 D3D2 D1 D0 I0 D7 D6 I7INSTRUCTION CYCL E\nSCLK\nSDIODATATRANSFER CYCLE\nCS\n \nFigure 21.

Logic 0 indicates a write \noperation.  \nX, X —Bits 6 and 5 of the instruction byte are Don’t Care.  \nA4, A3, A2, A1, A0 —Bits 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 of the instruction byte \ndetermine which register is  accessed during the data transfer \nportion of the communications cycle.  \nSERIAL INTERFACE POR T PIN DESCRIPTION \nSCLK —Serial Clock. The serial clock pin is used to synchronize \ndata to and from the A D9951 and to run the internal state \nmachines. SCLK maximum frequency is 25 MHz.  \nCSB —Chip Select Bar. CSB is active low input that allows more \nthan one device on the same serial communications line. The SDO and SDIO pins  go to a high impedance state when this \ninput is high. If driven high during any communications cycle, \nthat cycle is suspended until \nCS is reactivated low. Chip select \ncan be tied low in systems that maintain control of SCLK.  \nSDIO — Serial Data I/O. Data is always written in to the \nAD9951 on this pin. However, this pin can be used as a \nbidirectional data line. Bit 9 of Register Address 0x00 controls \nthe configuration of this pin. The default is Logic 0, which \nconfigur es the SDIO pin as bidirectional.  \nSDO —Serial Data Out. Data is read from this pin for protocols \nthat use separate lines for transmitting and receiving data. In the case where the AD9951 operates in a single bidirectional \nI/O mode, this pin does not output data and is set to a high impedance state.  \nIOSYNC —It synchronizes the I/O port state machines without \naffecting the contents of the addressable register. An active high \ninput on the IOSYNC pin ca uses the current communication \ncycle to abort. After IOSYNC returns low (Logic 0), another \ncommunication cycle may begin, starting with the instruction \nbyte write.  \nMSB/LSB TRANSFERS  \nThe AD9951 serial port can support both most significant bit \n(MSB) first or least significant bit (LSB) first data formats. This functionality is controlled by the Control Register 0x00 <8> bit. The default value of Control Register 0x00 <8> is low (MSB first). When Co ntrol Register 0x00 <8> is set high, the AD9951 serial port is in LSB first format. The instruction byte must be written in the format indicated by Control Register 0x00 <8>. If the AD9951 is in LSB first mode, the instruction byte must be \nwritten from least significant bit to most significant bit.  \nFor MSB first operation,  the serial port controller generates the \nmost significant byte (of the specified register) address first \nfollowed by the next lesser significant byte addresses until the \nI/O operation is complete. All data written to (read from) the \nAD9951 must be (is) in MSB first order. If the LSB mode is \nactive,  the serial port controller generates the least signifi cant \nbyte address first followed by the next greater significant byte \naddresses until the I/O operation is complete. All data written to (read from) the AD9951 must be ( is) in LSB first order.  \nExample Operation  \nTo write the amplitude scale factor register in MSB first format, \napply an instruction byte of 0x02 (serial address is 00010(b)). \nFrom this instructio n, the internal controller generates an \ninternal byte address of 0x0 8 (see the register map) for the first \ndata byte written and an internal address of 0x0 7 for the next \nbyte written. Since the amplitude scale factor register is two \nbytes wide, this ends the communication cycle.  \nTo write the amplitude scale factor register in LSB first format, \napply an instruction byte of 0x40. From this instruction, the \ninternal controller generate s an internal byte address of 0x0 7 \n(see the register map) for the first data byte written and an \ninternal address of 0x0 8 for the next byte written. Since the  \namplitude scale factor register is two bytes wide, this ends the \ncommunication cycle.  \nPower -Down Functions of the AD9951  \nThe AD9951 supports an externally controlled or hardware \npower -down feature as well as the more common software \nprogrammable power -down bits found in prev ious ADI DDS \nproducts.   \nThe software control power -down allows the DAC, PLL, input \nclock circuitry, and digital l ogic to be individually powered down  \nvia unique control bits (CFR1<7:4>). With the exception of \nCFR1<6> , these bits are not active when the externally controlled  \npower-down pin (PWRDWNCTL) is high. External power -down \ncontrol is supported on the AD9951  via the PWRDWNCTL input \npin. When the PWRDWNCTL  input pin is high, the AD9951  \nenters  a power -down mode based on the CFR1<3>  bit. When \nthe PWRDWNCTL input pin is low,  the external power -down  \ncontrol is inactive.  \nData Sheet  AD9951  \n \nRev. D | Page 23 of 25 When the CFR1<3> bit is 0 and the PWRDWNCTL input pin is \nhigh, the AD9951 is put into a fast recovery power -down mode. \nIn this mode, the digital logic and the DAC digital logic are \npowered down. The DAC bias circuitry, PLL, oscillator, and clock input circuitry is not  powered down.  \nWhen the CFR1<3> bit is high, and the PWRDWNCTL input pin is high, the AD9951 is put into the full power -down mode. \nIn this mode, all functions are powered down. This includes the \nDAC and PLL, which take a significant amount of time to power up.  \nWhen the PWRDWNCTL input pin is high, the individual \npower -down bits (CFR1<7>, <5:4>) are invalid (Don’t Care) \nand unused.  When the PWRDWNCTL input pin is low, the  \nindividual power -down bits control the power -down modes of \noperation.  \nNote that the power -down signals are all designed such that a \nLogic 1 indicates the low power mode and a Logic 0 indicates \nthe active or powered up mode.  Table 8 indicates the logic level for each power -down bit that \ndrives out of the AD9951 core logic to the analog section and \nthe digital clock generat ion section of the chip for the external \npower -down operation.  \nLayout Considerations  \nFor the best performance, observe the following layout \nguidelines. Always provide the analog power supply (AVDD) \nand the digital power supply (DVDD) on separate supplies, even if just from two different voltage regulators driven by a common supply. Likewise, the ground connections (AGND, DGND) should be kept separate as far back to the source as possible ( that is,  separate the ground planes on a localized \nboard, even if the grounds connect to a common point in the system). Bypass capacitors should be placed as close to the device pin as possible. Usually, a multitiered bypassing scheme \nconsisting of a small high fr equency capacitor (100 pF) placed \nclose to the supply pin and progressively larger capacitors (0.1 µF, \n10 µF) further away from the actual supply source works best.  \n \nTable 8.
