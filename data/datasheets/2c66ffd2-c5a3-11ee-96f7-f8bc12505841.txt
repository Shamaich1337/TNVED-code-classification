It ma y reduce the impedance or inductance, or cause damage to \ncomponents due to over -current.  \n(6) For magnetic products , keep clear of anything that may generate magnetic fields such as speakers and coils. Use non -magnetic \ntweezers when handing the chips.  \n(7) W hen soldering, the electrical characteristics may be varied due to hot energy and mechanical stress.  \n(8) When coating products with resin, the relatively high resin curing stress may change the electrical characteristics. For exterior \ncoating, select resin  carefully so that electrical and mechanical performance of the product is not affected. Before using, please \nevaluate reliability with the product mounted in your application set.  \n(9) When mount chips with adhesive in preliminary assembly, do appropriate check before the soldering stage, i.e., the size of land \npattern, type of adhesive, amount applied, hardening of the adhesive on proper usage and amounts of adhesive to use.  \n(10) Mounting density: Add special attention to radiating heat of products when mo unting other components nearby. The excessive heat \nby other products may cause deterioration at joint of this product with substrate.  \n(11) Since some products are constructed like an open magnetic circuit, narrow spacing between components may cause magnet ic \ncoupling.  \n(12) Please do not give the product any excessive mechanical shocks in transportation.  \n(13) Please do not touch wires by sharp terminals such as tweezers to avoid causing any damage to wires.  \n(14) Please do not add any shock and power to the s oldered product to avoid causing any damage to chip body.  \n(15) Please do not touch the electrodes by naked hand as the solderability of the external electrodes may deteriorate  by grease or oil on \nthe skin. \n7.2 PCB Bending Design  \nThe following shall be con sidered when designing and laying out PCB’s.  \n(1) PCB shall be designed so that products are not subjected to the mechanical stress from board warp or deflection.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) Products location on PCB separation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) When splitting the PCB board, or in sert (remove) connector, or fasten thread after mounting components, care is required so as not to \ngive any stress of deflection or twisting to the board. Because mechanical force may cause deterioration of the bonding stren gth of  \nelectrode and solder, ev en crack of product body. Board separation should not be done manually, but by using appropriate devices.  \n7.3 Recommended PCB Design for SMT Land -Patterns  \nWhen chips are mounted on a PCB, the amount of solder used (size of fillet) can directly affect chip performance. Therefore, the following \nitems must be carefully considered in the design of solder land patterns:  \n(1) The amount of solder applied can affect the ability of chips to withstand mechanical stresses which may lead to breaking or cracking. \nTheref ore, when designing land -patterns it is necessary to consider the appropriate size and configuration of the solder pads which in \nturn determines the amount of solder necessary to form the fillets.  \n(2) When more than one part is jointly soldered onto the sa me land or pad, the pad must be designed that each component’s soldering \npoint is separated by solder -resist.  \nRecommended land dimensions please refer to product specification.  \n8    Recommended Soldering Technologies  \n8.1Re -flowing Profile:  \n△ Preheat conditi on: 150 ~200 ℃/60~120 sec.  \n△ Allowed time above 217 ℃: 60~90s ec. \n△ Max temp: 2 60℃ \n△ Max time at max temp: 10sec.  \n△ Solder paste: Sn/3.0Ag/0.5Cu  \n△ Allowed Reflow time: 2x max  \nPlease refer to Fig. 8.1 \n[Note: The reflow profile in the above table is only for  \nqualificati on and is not meant to specify board assembly  \nprofiles.
