The SCL/SDA upstream pair fans out toeight downstream pairs, or channels. Any individual\nSCx/SDx channel or combination of channels can\nbe selected, determined by the contents of the\nprogrammable control register. These downstream\nchannels can be used to resolve I2C slave address\nconflicts. For example, if eight identical digital\ntemperature sensors are needed in the application,\none sensor can be connected at each channel: 0-7.\nThe system master can reset the PCA9548A in the\nevent of a time-out or other improper operation by\nasserting a low in the RESET  input. Similarly, the\npower-on reset deselects all channels and initializes\nthe I2C/SMBus state machine. Asserting RESET\ncauses the same reset and initialization to occur\nwithout powering down the part. This allows recovery\nshould once of the downstream I2C buses get stuck in\na low state.\nThe pass gates of the switches are constructed so\nthat the V CC pin can be used to limit the maximum\nhigh voltage, which is passed by the PCA9548A.\nThis allows the use of different bus voltages on\neach pair, so that 1.8-V, 2.5-V or 3.3-V parts can\ncommunicate with 5-V parts, without any additional\nprotection. External pull-up resistors pull the bus up to\nthe desired voltage level for each channel. All I/O pins\nare 5-V tolerant.\nDevice Information\nDEVICE NAME PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nPCA9548ASSOP (24) 8.20 mm × 5.30 mm\nTVSOP (24) 5.00 mm × 4.40 mm\nSOIC (24) 15.40 mm × 7.50 mm\nTSSOP (24) 7.80 mm × 4.40 mm\nVQFN (24) 4.00 mm × 4.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the datasheet.\nPCA9548ASlaves A 0, A1...A N\nSlaves B 0, B1...B N\nSlaves H 0, H 1...H NI2C or SMBus\nMaster\n(processor)SDA\nSCLSD0\nSC0Channel 0\nChannel 1\nChannel 7RESETSD1\nSC1\nSD7\nSC7VCC\nA1\nA2\nGNDA0Slaves C 0, C 1...C NChannel 2SD2\nSC2\nSimplified Schematicwww.ti.comPCA9548A\nSCPS143G – JUNE 2009 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9548APCA9548A\nSCPS143G – JUNE 2009 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The master SCL/SDA signal pair is directed\nto eight channels of slave devices, SC0/SD0-SC3/SD3. Any individual downstream channel can be selected as\nwell as any combination of the eight channels.\nThe device offers an active-low RESET  input which resets the state machine and allows the PCA9548A to\nrecover if one of the downstream I2C buses get stuck in a low state. The state machine of the device can also be\nreset by cycling the power supply, V CC, also known as a power-on reset (POR). Both the RESET  function and a\nPOR cause all channels to be deselected.\nThe connections of the I2C data path are controlled by the same I2C master device that is switched to\ncommunicate with multiple I2C slaves. After the successful acknowledgment of the slave address (hardware\nselectable by A0 and A1 pins), a single 8-bit control register is written to or read from to determine the selected\nchannels.\nThe PCA9548A may also be used for voltage translation, allowing the use of different bus voltages on each\nSCn/SDn pair such that 1.8-V, 2.5-V, or 3.3-V parts can communicate with 5-V parts. This is achieved by using\nexternal pull-up resistors to pull the bus up to the desired voltage for the master and each slave channel.PCA9548A\nSCPS143G – JUNE 2009 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9548A\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nPCA9548A\nSC0\nSC1\nSC2\nSC3\nSC4\nSC5\nSC6\nSC7\nSD0\nSD1\nSD2\nSD3\nSD4\nSD5\nSD6\nSD7\nGND\nVCC\nRESET\nSCL\nSDASwitch□Control□Logic\nReset□Circuit\nInput□Filter\nI C□Bus□Control2A0\nA1\nA2\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe PCA9548A is an 8-channel, bidirectional translating switch for I2C buses that supports Standard-Mode\n(100 kHz) and Fast-Mode (400 kHz) operation. The PCA9548A features I2C control using a single 8-bit control\nregister in which each bit controls the enabling and disabling for one of the 8 switch channels of I2C data flow.\nDepending on the application, voltage translation of the I2C bus can also be achieved using the PCA9548A to\nallow 1.8-V, 2.5-V, or 3.3-V parts to communicate with 5-V parts. Additionally, in the event that communication on\nthe I2C bus enters a fault state, the PCA9548A can be reset to resume normal operation using the RESET  pin\nfeature or by a power-on reset which results from cycling power to the device.www.ti.comPCA9548A\nSCPS143G – JUNE 2009 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9548A\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 RESET Input\nThe RESET input is an active-low signal that may be used to recover from a bus-fault condition. When this signal\nis asserted low for a minimum of t WL, the PCA9548A resets its registers and I2C state machine and deselects all\nchannels. The RESET input must be connected to V CC through a pull-up resistor.\n8.4.1.1 RESET Errata\nIf RESET voltage set higher than VCC, current flows from RESET pin to VCC pin.\n8.4.1.1.1 System Impact\nVCC is pulled above its regular voltage level.\n8.4.1.1.2 System Workaround\nDesign such that RESET voltage is same or lower than VCC.\n8.4.2 Power-On Reset\nWhen power (from 0 V) is applied to V CC, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9548A in a reset condition\nuntil V CC has reached V POR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the PCA9548A registers and I2C\nstate machine initialize to their default states. After that, V CC must be lowered to below V POR and then back up to\nthe operating voltage for a power-reset cycle.\n8.5 Programming\n8.5.1 I2C Interface\nThe bidirectional I2C bus consists of the serial clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA) lines. Both lines must be\nconnected to a positive supply through a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data\ntransfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\nI2C communication with this device is initiated by a master sending a start condition, a high-to-low transition on\nthe SDA input/output while the SCL input is high (see Figure 8-1 ). After the start condition, the device address\nbyte is sent, most significant bit (MSB) first, including the data direction bit (R/ W).\nAfter receiving the valid address byte, this device responds with an acknowledge (ACK), a low on the SDA\ninput/output during the high of the ACK-related clock pulse. The address inputs (A0–A2) of the slave device must\nnot be changed between the start and the stop conditions.\nOn the I2C bus, only one data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain\nstable during the high pulse of the clock period, as changes in the data line at this time are interpreted as control\ncommands (start or stop) (see Figure 8-2 ).\nA stop condition, a low-to-high transition on the SDA input/output while the SCL input is high, is sent by the\nmaster (see Figure 8-1 ).\nAny number of data bytes can be transferred from the transmitter to receiver between the start and the stop\nconditions. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one ACK bit. The transmitter must release the SDA line before\nthe receiver can send an ACK bit. The device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the ACK\nclock pulse so that the SDA line is stable low during the high pulse of the ACK-related clock period (see Figure\n8-3). When a slave receiver is addressed, it must generate an ACK after each byte is received. Similarly, the\nmaster must generate an ACK after each byte that it receives from the slave transmitter. Setup and hold times\nmust be met to ensure proper operation.\nA master receiver signals an end of data to the slave transmitter by not generating an acknowledge (NACK) after\nthe last byte has been clocked out of the slave. This is done by the master receiver by holding the SDA line high.\nIn this event, the transmitter must release the data line to enable the master to generate a stop condition.PCA9548A\nSCPS143G – JUNE 2009 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9548A\nSDA\nSCL\nStart ConditionS\nStop ConditionPFigure 8-1.

This register can be written and read via\nthe I2C bus. Each bit in the command byte corresponds to a SCn/SDn channel and a high (or 1) selects\nthis channel. Multiple SCn/SDn channels may be selected at the same time. When a channel is selected, the\nchannel becomes active after a stop condition has been placed on the I2C bus. This ensures that all SCn/SDn\nlines are in a high state when the channel is made active, so that no false conditions are generated at the time\nof connection. A stop condition always must occur immediately after the acknowledge cycle. If multiple bytes are\nreceived by the PCA9548A, it saves the last byte received.\nChannel□Selection□Bits□(Read/Write)\nChannel□1Channel□0\nChannel□2\nChannel□3\nChannel□4\nChannel□5\nChannel□6\nChannel□7B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0\nFigure 8-5.

The command byte is sent after the address and determines which SCn/SDn channel is accessed.\nAfter a restart, the device address is sent again, but this time, the LSB is set to a logic 1. Data from the SCn/SDn\nchannel defined by the command byte then is sent by the PCA9548A (see Figure 8-7 ). After a restart, the value\nof the SCn/SDn channel defined by the command byte matches the SCn/SDn channel being accessed when the\nrestart occurred. Data is clocked into the SCn/SDn channel on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse.

TI’s customers are responsible for\ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nApplications of the PCA9548A contain an I2C (or SMBus) master device and up to eight I2C slave devices.\nThe downstream channels are ideally used to resolve I2C slave address conflicts. For example, if eight identical\ndigital temperature sensors are needed in the application, one sensor can be connected at each channel: 0, 1,\n2, and 3. When the temperature at a specific location needs to be read, the appropriate channel can be enabled\nand all other channels switched off, the data can be retrieved, and the I2C master can move on and read the\nnext channel.\nIn an application where the I2C bus contains many additional slave devices that do not result in I2C slave\naddress conflicts, these slave devices can be connected to any desired channel to distribute the total bus\ncapacitance across multiple channels. If multiple switches are enabled simultaneously, additional design\nrequirements must be considered (See the Design Requirements  and Detailed Design Procedure  sections).\n9.2 Typical Application\nA typical application of the PCA9548A contains 1 or many separate data pull-up voltages, V CC , one for\nthe master device and one for each of the selectable slave channels, 0 through 7. In the event where the\nmaster device and all slave devices operate at the same voltage, then the VCC pin can be connected to this\nsupply voltage. In an application where voltage translation is necessary, additional design requirements must be\nconsidered (See the Design Requirements  section).\nFigure 9-1  shows an application in which the PCA9548A can be used.www.ti.comPCA9548A\nSCPS143G – JUNE 2009 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9548A\nPCA9548ASD1SDAChannel 0\nChannel 1\nChannel 2\nChannel 3See Note A\nI2C/SMBus\nMasterSCL\nRESET\nSC1\nSD2\nSC2\nSD3\nSC3SD0\nSC0VCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 V\nVCC = 3.3 V\nVCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 V\nVCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 V\nVCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 V\nVCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 VSee Note A\nSee Note A\nSee Note ASDA\nSCL\nA2\nA1\nA0\nGND23\n22\n3\n12122124\n1110987654\nSD5Channel 4\nChannel 5\nChannel 6\nChannel 7See Note A\nSC5\nSD6\nSC6\nSD7\nSC7SD4\nSC4VCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 V\nVCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 V\nVCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 V\nVCC = 2.7 V to 5.5 VSee Note A\nSee Note A\nSee Note A\n2019181716151413RESETA.

These pins\nmay be tied directly to GND or V CC in the application.\nIf multiple slave channels are activated simultaneously in the application, then the total I OL from SCL/SDA to\nGND on the master side is the sum of the currents through all pull-up resistors, R p.\nThe pass-gate transistors of the PCA9548A are constructed such that the V CC voltage can be used to limit the\nmaximum voltage that is passed from one I2C bus to another.\nFigure 9-2  shows the voltage characteristics of the pass-gate transistors (note that the graph was generated\nusing data specified in the Electrical Characteristics  section of this data sheet). In order for the PCA9548A to act\nas a voltage translator, the V pass voltage must be equal to or lower than the lowest bus voltage. For example,\nif the main bus is running at 5 V and the downstream buses are 3.3 V and 2.7 V, V pass must be equal to or\nbelow 2.7 V to effectively clamp the downstream bus voltages. As shown in Figure 9-2 , Vpass(max)  is 2.7 V when\nthe PCA9548A supply voltage is 4 V or lower, so the PCA9548A supply voltage could be set to 3.3 V. Pull-up\nresistors then can be used to bring the bus voltages to their appropriate levels (see Figure 9-1 ).\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nOnce all the slaves are assigned to the appropriate slave channels and bus voltages are identified, the pull-up\nresistors, R p, for each of the buses need to be selected appropriately. The minimum pull-up resistance is a\nfunction of the reference voltage of the specific I2C channel (V DPUX), VOL,(max) , and I OL as shown in Equation 1 .\nDPUX OL(max)\np(min)\nOLV V \nRI\x10\n \n(1)\nThe maximum pull-up resistance is a function of the maximum rise time, t r (300 ns for fast-mode operation, f SCL\n= 400 kHz) and bus capacitance, C bis given by Equation 2 .\nr\np(max)\nbtR0.8473 C u\n(2)\nThe maximum bus capacitance for an I2C bus must not exceed 400 pF for fast-mode operation. The bus\ncapacitance can be approximated by adding the capacitance of the PCA9548A, C io(OFF) , the capacitance of\nwires, connections, traces, and the capacitance of each individual slave on a given channel. If multiple channels\nare activated simultaneously, each of the slaves on all channels contribute to total bus capacitance.www.ti.comPCA9548A\nSCPS143G – JUNE 2009 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9548A\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nVCC (V)Vpass (V)\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5012345\nD00725ºC (Room Temperature)\n85ºC\n-40ºC\nStandard-mode  (fSCL kHz, t r SPACE  (fSCL kHz, t r)\nFigure 9-2.

It is common to have a dedicated ground plane on an inner layer of the board and pins that are\nconnected to ground must have a low-impedance path to the ground plane in the form of wide polygon pours\nand multiple vias. By-pass and de-coupling capacitors are commonly used to control the voltage on the VCC pin,\nusing a larger capacitor to provide additional power in the event of a short power supply glitch and a smaller\ncapacitor to filter out high-frequency ripple.\nIn an application where voltage translation is not required, all V DPUX voltages and V CC could be at the same\npotential and a single copper plane could connect all of pull-up resistors to the appropriate reference voltage. In\nan application where voltage translation is required, V DPUM  and V DPU0 – V DPU7 may all be on the same layer of\nthe board with split planes to isolate different voltage potentials.\nTo reduce the total I2C bus capacitance added by PCB parasitics, data lines (SCn and SDn) must be a short\nas possible and the widths of the traces must also be minimized (For example, 5-10 mils depending on copper\nweight).www.ti.comPCA9548A\nSCPS143G – JUNE 2009 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9548A\n11.2 Layout Example\nSD7SC7\nSD6SC6\nSC4\nSD4SD0A0\nA1\nRESET\nSC0\nSD1\nSC1\nGNDVCC\nSDA\nSCL\nA2\nSD3\nSC3SD2\nSC2VDPU0Via to Power PlanePartial Power Plane\nVDPUMVia to GND PlaneCopper Pour\nVCC\nGNDBy-pass/de-coupling\ncapacitors\nPCA9548AGNDTo I2C MasterTo Slave Channel 0LEGEND\nSC5\nSD5(inner layer)\n(outer layer)\nVDPU2To Slave Channel 2VDPU1To Slave Channel 1\nVDPU6To Slave Channel 6\nVDPU5To Slave Channel 5\nVDPU3To Slave Channel 3VDPU4To Slave Channel 4VDPU7To Slave Channel 7\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12 131415161718192021222324 PW package\nFigure 11-1.
