Each gate performs the Boolean \nfunction Y = A in positive logic.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Balanced CMOS Push-Pull Outputs\nThis device includes balanced CMOS push-pull outputs. The term "balanced" indicates that the device can sink \nand source similar currents. The drive capability of this device may create fast edges into light loads so routing \nand load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing. Additionally, the outputs of this device are capable \nof driving larger currents than the device can sustain without being damaged. It is important for the output power \nof the device to be limited to avoid damage due to overcurrent. The electrical and thermal limits defined in the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  must be followed at all times.\nUnused push-pull CMOS outputs should be left disconnected.\n8.3.2 CMOS Schmitt-Trigger Inputs\nThis device includes inputs with the Schmitt-trigger architecture. These inputs are high impedance and are \ntypically modeled as a resistor in parallel with the input capacitance given in the Electrical Characteristics  table \nfrom the input to ground. The worst case resistance is calculated with the maximum input voltage, given in the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  table, and the maximum input leakage current, given in the Electrical Characteristics \ntable, using Ohm\'s law (R = V ÷ I).\nThe Schmitt-trigger input architecture provides hysteresis as defined by ΔVT in the Electrical Characteristics \ntable, which makes this device extremely tolerant to slow or noisy inputs. While the inputs can be driven much \nslower than standard CMOS inputs, it is still recommended to properly terminate unused inputs. Driving the \ninputs with slow transitioning signals will increase dynamic current consumption of the device. For additional \ninformation regarding Schmitt-trigger inputs, please see Understanding Schmitt Triggers .\n8.3.3 Clamp Diode Structure\nThe inputs and outputs to this device have both positive and negative clamping diodes as depicted in Electrical \nPlacement of Clamping Diodes for Each Input and Output .\nCAUTION\nVoltages beyond the values specified in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  table can cause damage \nto the device. The input and output voltage ratings may be exceeded if the input and output clamp-\ncurrent ratings are observed.www.ti.comSN74HCS14\nSCLS799D – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HCS14\nGND Logic Input OutputVCCDevice\n-IIK+IIK +IOK\n-IOKFigure 8-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74HCS14  can be used to add an additional stage to a counter with an external flip-flop. Because \ncounters use a negative edge trigger, the flip-flop\'s clock input must be inverted to provide this function. Having \nSchmitt-trigger inputs is important in this application to eliminate any noise issues that could impact the counting \nfunction which could lead to incorrect frequency division. This function only requires one of the six available \ninverters in the SN74HCS14  device, so the remaining channels can be used for other applications needing an \ninverted signal or improved signal integrity. Unused inputs must be terminated at V CC or GND. Unused outputs \ncan be left floating.\n9.2 Typical Application\nD-Type\nFlip-FlopCounter 20\n21\n22\n23\n24InputClear\nQ CLR\nQ DCLR\nFigure 9-1. Typical application block diagram\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\n9.2.1.1 Power Considerations\nEnsure the desired supply voltage is within the range specified in the Recommended Operating Conditions . The \nsupply voltage sets the device\'s electrical characteristics as described in the Electrical Characteristics .\nThe positive voltage supply must be capable of sourcing current equal to the total current to be sourced by all \noutputs of the SN74HCS14  plus the maximum static supply current, I CC, listed in Electrical Characteristics  and \nany transient current required for switching. The logic device can only source as much current as is provided by \nthe positive supply source. Be sure not to exceed the maximum total current through V CC listed in the Absolute \nMaximum Ratings .\nThe ground must be capable of sinking current equal to the total current to be sunk by all outputs of the \nSN74HCS14  plus the maximum supply current, I CC, listed in Electrical Characteristics , and any transient current \nrequired for switching. The logic device can only sink as much current as can be sunk into its ground connection. \nBe sure not to exceed the maximum total current through GND listed in the Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nThe SN74HCS14  can drive a load with a total capacitance less than or equal to 50 pF  while still meeting all of \nthe datasheet specifications. Larger capacitive loads can be applied, however it is not recommended to exceed \n50 pF .\nThe SN74HCS14  can drive a load with total resistance described by R L ≥ VO / IO, with the output voltage and \ncurrent defined in the Electrical Characteristics  table with VOH and VOL.

Do not violate any values listed in the Absolute Maximum \nRatings . These limits are provided to prevent damage to the device.\n9.2.1.2 Input Considerations\nInput signals must cross Vt-(min)  to be considered a logic LOW, and Vt+(max)  to be considered a logic HIGH. Do \nnot exceed the maximum input voltage range found in the  Absolute Maximum Ratings .\nUnused inputs must be terminated to either V CC or ground. These can be directly terminated if the input is \ncompletely unused, or they can be connected with a pull-up or pull-down resistor if the input is to be used \nsometimes, but not always. A pull-up resistor is used for a default state of HIGH, and a pull-down resistor is used \nfor a default state of LOW. The resistor size is limited by drive current of the controller, leakage current into the \nSN74HCS14 , as specified in the Electrical Characteristics , and the desired input transition rate. A 10-k Ω resistor \nvalue is often used due to these factors.\nThe SN74HCS14  has no input signal transition rate requirements because it has Schmitt-trigger inputs.\nAnother benefit to having Schmitt-trigger inputs is the ability to reject noise. Noise with a large enough amplitude \ncan still cause issues. To know how much noise is too much, please refer to the ΔVT(min)  in the Electrical \nCharacteristics . This hysteresis value will provide the peak-to-peak limit.\nUnlike what happens with standard CMOS inputs, Schmitt-trigger inputs can be held at any valid value without \ncausing huge increases in power consumption. The typical additional current caused by holding an input at a \nvalue other than V CC or ground is plotted in the Typical Characteristics .\nRefer to the Feature Description  section for additional information regarding the inputs for this device.\n9.2.1.3 Output Considerations\nThe positive supply voltage is used to produce the output HIGH voltage. Drawing current from the output will \ndecrease the output voltage as specified by the V OH specification in the Electrical Characteristics . The ground \nvoltage is used to produce the output LOW voltage. Sinking current into the output will increase the output \nvoltage as specified by the V OL specification in the Electrical Characteristics .\nPush-pull outputs that could be in opposite states, even for a very short time period, should never be connected \ndirectly together. This can cause excessive current and damage to the device.\nTwo channels within the same device with the same input signals can be connected in parallel for additional \noutput drive strength.\nUnused outputs can be left floating. Do not connect outputs directly to V CC or ground .\nRefer to Feature Description  section for additional information regarding the outputs for this device.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1.Add a decoupling capacitor from V CC to GND. The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the \ndevice and electrically close to both the V CC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in the Layout \nsection.SN74HCS14\nSCLS799D – JANUARY 2020 – REVISED DECEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HCS14\n2.Ensure the capacitive load at the output is ≤ 50 pF . This is not a hard limit, however it will ensure optimal \nperformance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the SN74HCS14 \nto the receiving device(s).\n3.Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (V CC / IO(max) ) Ω. This will ensure that the maximum \noutput current from the Absolute Maximum Ratings  is not violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load \nmeasured in megaohms; much larger than the minimum calculated above.\n4.Thermal issues are rarely a concern for logic gates, however the power consumption and thermal increase \ncan be calculated using the steps provided in the application report, CMOS Power Consumption and Cpd \nCalculation .\n9.2.3 Application Curves\n23 \n2423Input ± 32 kHz\n24 ± 1 kHz\nFigure 9-2.

Each V CC terminal should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power \ndisturbance. A 0.1- μF capacitor is recommended for this device. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass caps \nto reject different frequencies of noise. The 0.1- μF and 1- μF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The \nbypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results, as shown in \ngiven example layout image.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple-input and multiple-channel logic devices inputs must not ever be left floating. In many \ncases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused; for example, when only two inputs of a \ntriple-input AND gate are used or only 3 of the 4 buffer gates are used. Such unused input pins must not be left \nunconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. \nAll unused inputs of digital logic devices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the \ninput voltage specifications, to prevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular \nunused input depends on the function of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or V CC, whichever \nmakes more sense for the logic function or is more convenient.\n11.2 Layout Example\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n714\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n81A\n1Y\n2Y\n3A\n3YGND V CC\n6A\n6Y\n5Y\n4A\n4Y GNDVCC\n5A2A0.1 \x1dF\nUnused input \ntied to GNDBypass capacitor \nplaced close to \nthe device\nAvoid 90°  \ncorners for \nsignal linesRecommend GND flood fill for \nimproved signal isolation, noise \nreduction, and thermal dissipation\nUnused output \nleft floatingUnused input \ntied to V CC\nFigure 11-1.
