The maximum data rate has been extended to \n4Mbps to support high speed protocols based on the CAN \nphysical layer . Supports up to 4Mbps CAN with Flexible \nData Rate (CAN FD). Enhanced ESD protection allows \nthese parts to withstand ±25kV HBM on the transceiver \ninterface pins without latchup or damage.\nExtended ±36V input common mode range and high \ncommon mode rejection on the CAN receiver provides \ntolerance of large ground loop voltages. A sophisticated  CAN driver with active symmetry control maintains tight control of the common mode voltage for excellent elec -\ntromagnetic emission, while the variable slew rate and \nsplit termination support allow additional EME reduction. \nCAN Bus Link with Large Ground Loop VoltageLTC2875 T ransmitting at 4Mbps  \nfrom a 3.3V SupplyAPPLICATIONSn Protected  from Overvoltage Line Faults to ±60V \nn 3.3 V or 5V Supply Voltage\nn High  Speed CAN FD Operation Up to 4Mbps\nn ±25 kV ESD Interface Pins, ±8kV All Other Pins\nn V ariable Slew Rate Driver with Active Symmetry \nControl and SPLIT Pin for Low Electromagnetic Emission (EME)\nn Extended  Common Mode Range (±36V)\nn Ideal  Passive Behavior to CAN Bus with Supply Off\nn Current  Limited Drivers and Thermal Shutdown\nn Power -Up/Down Glitch-Free Driver Outputs\nn Micropower  Shutdown Mode\nn T ransmit Data (TXD) Dominant Timeout Function\nn ISO  11898-2 and CAN FD Compliant\nn DeviceNet  Compatible\nn Up  to MP-Grade Available (–55°C to 125°C)\nn 3mm × 3mm 8-Lead DFN and SO-8 Packages\nn Industrial  Control and Instrumentation Networks\nn Automotive  and T ransportation Electronics\nn Building  Automation, Security Systems, HVAC \nn Medical  Equipment\n2875 TA01a120/uni03A9L TC2875\nCANH\nCANL\nGND1 AC GROUND\nLOOP ≤ 36V\nPEAKGND2CANLVCC1 VCC2\nCANHL TC2875\nR\nDRXD1\nTXD1\nRS1RXD2\nTXD2\nRS2R\nD120/uni03A9\n100ns/DIVTXD\n2V/DIV\nRXD\n2V/DIV\nCANH\n1V/DIV\nCANL\n1V/DIV\n2875 TA01b\nCOMMON MODE\nLTC28752\nRev A For more information www.analog.comPIN CONFIGURATIONABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nSupply Voltages\n \nVCC........................................................... – 0.3V to 6V\nLogic Input Voltages (TXD, RS) \n \n.................. –0.3V to 6V\nInterface I/O: CANH, CANL, SPLIT \n \n............. –60V to 60V\nReceiver Output (RXD) \n \n................. –0.3V to (V CC + 0.3V )\nBus Differential Voltage (CANH-CANL)\n \n......–120V  to 120V(Note 1)\n1\n2348765 TOP VIEW\nRS\nCANHCANLSPLITTXD\nGND\nV\nCC\nRXD\nS8 PACKAGE\n8-LEAD (150mil) PLASTIC SO \nTJMAX = 150°C, θ JA = 120°C/W , θ JC = 39°C/WTOP VIEW\nDD PACKAGE\n8-LEAD (3mm × 3mm) PLASTIC DFN5678\n9\n4321 TXD\nGND\nVCC\nRXDRS\nCANHCANLSPLIT\n \nTJMAX = 150°C, θ JA = 43°C/W , θ JC = 5.5°C/W \nEXPOSED PAD (PIN 9) CONNECT TO PCB GND\nORDER INFORMATION\nLEAD FREE FINISH TAPE AND REEL PART MARKING PACKAGE DESCRIPTION TEMPERATURE RANGE\nLTC2875IDD#PBF LTC2875IDD#TRPBF LGKG 8-Lead (3mm × 3mm) Plastic DFN –40°C to 85°C\nLTC2875HDD#PBF LTC2875HDD#TRPBF LGKG 8-Lead (3mm × 3mm) Plastic DFN –40°C to 125°C\nLTC2875MPDD#PBF LTC2875MPDD#TRPBF LGKG 8-Lead (3mm × 3mm) Plastic DFN –55°C to 125°C\nLTC2875IS8#PBF LTC2875IS8#TRPBF 2875 8-Lead (150 mil) Plastic SO –40°C to 85°C\nLTC2875HS8#PBF LTC2875HS8#TRPBF 2875 8-Lead (150 mil) Plastic SO –40°C to 125°C\nLTC2875MPS8#PBF LTC2875MPS8#TRPBF 2875 8-Lead (150 mil) Plastic SO –55°C to 125°C\nContact the factory for parts specified with wider operating temperature ranges.\nTape and reel specifications.

An inter -\nnal comparator monitors the supply voltage and switches \ninternal reference voltages and output drive strengths at \napproximately 4.1V. Because of the discontinuity in the \ninternal voltages at this switch point, operation with a sup -\nply voltage between 3.6V and 4.5V is not recommended.\n±\n60V Fault Protection\nThe LTC2875 addresses application needs for an overvolt -\nage tolerant CAN transceiver that can operate from both \n3.3V and 5V supplies and provide extended common mode \noperation, high noise immunity and low electromagnetic \nemission. Industrial installations may encounter com -\nmon mode voltages between nodes far greater than the \n–2V to 7V range specified by the ISO 11898-2 standard. \nCompeting CAN transceivers can be damaged by voltages beyond their typical absolute maximum ratings of – 3V to \n16V. The limited overvoltage tolerance makes implemen -\ntation of effective external protection networks difficult \nwithout interfering with proper data network performance. \nReplacing standard CAN transceivers with LTC2875  \ndevices can eliminate field failures due to overvoltage \nfaults without using costly external protection devices. \nThe ±60V fault protection of the LTC2875 is achieved by \nusing a high voltage BiCMOS integrated circuit technol -\nogy. The naturally high breakdown voltage of this technol -\nogy provides protection in powered off and high imped -\nance conditions. The driver outputs use a progressive \nfoldback current limit to protect against overvoltage faults \nwhile still allowing high current output drive. \nThe LTC2875 is protected from ± 60V bus faults even \nwith the loss of GND or V CC (GND open faults are not \ntested in production). In the case of V CC open, or shorted \nto GND, the LTC2875 is off and the bus pins remain in \nthe high impedance state. Additional precautions must \nbe taken in the case of V CC present and GND open. The \nLTC2875 chip protects itself from damage but may turn on despite the open GND pin. When the RS or TXD input is pulled low with the GND pin floating, a sneak path to \nGND is established:  through the ESD diode on the RS \nor TXD pin;  out through the RS or TXD pin;  and into \nthe external driver that is pulling the pin low (Figure\xa09).  APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe current in this path can have a maximum current of –100mA with a maximum voltage of approximately V\nCC \n– 2.5V during an overvoltage fault condition on the CANL \npin because the entire current that should flow out the \nGND pin may flow out the input pin instead. If a GND open \nfault with V CC present is anticipated, the system designer \nshould choose drivers for the RS and TXD inputs that are protected against shorts to V\nCC – 2.5V.\nThe high voltage rating of the LTC2875 makes it simple to \nextend the overvoltage protection to higher levels using \nexternal protection components. Compared to lower volt -\nage CAN transceivers, external protection devices with \nhigher breakdown voltages can be used so as not to inter -\nfere with data transmission in the presence of large com -\nmon mode voltages. Figure\xa014 in the Typical Application \nsection shows a network capable of protecting against IEC \nLevel 4 surge, while still providing up to ±35V common mode range on the signal lines.\nFigure\xa09. Sneak Path to GND with GND Pin Floating\n±36V Extended Common Mode Range\nThe LTC2875 receiver features an extended common \nmode range of –36V to 36V when operating from a 5V \nsupply, and – 25V to 25V when operating from a 3.3V sup -\nply. The wide common mode increases the reliability of \noperation in environments with high common mode volt -\nages created by electrical noise or local ground potential differences due to ground loops. This extended common mode range allows the LTC2875 to transmit and receive under conditions that would cause data errors and pos -\nsible device damage in competing products. 2875 F09RXDTXD TXD\nGNDV\nCC\nRXDVCC\nVCC\nL TC2875\nRS\nCANHRSB\nCANH\nCANL\nSPLITCANL\nSPLIT\nLTC287513\nRev A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n±25kV ESD Protection\nThe LTC2875 features exceptionally robust ESD protec -\ntion. The transceiver interface pins (CANH, CANL, SPLIT) \nfeature protection with respect to GND to ± 25kV HBM \nwithout latchup or damage, during all modes of opera -\ntion or while unpowered. All other pins are protected to \n±8kV HBM to make the LTC2875 reliable under severe \nenvironmental conditions.\n4Mbps Operation\nThe LTC2865 features a high speed receiver and trans -\nmitter capable of operating up to 4 Mbps. In order to \noperate at this data rate, the transmitter must be set at its \nmaximum slew rate by pulling the RS pin low to ground \nwith no more than 4kΩ of resistance, including the output \nimpedance of the buffer driving the RS input (see RS Pin and Variable Slew Rate Control below).\nDriver\nThe driver provides full CAN compatibility. When TXD is \nlow with the chip enabled (RS low), the dominant state is \nasserted on the CAN bus lines (subject to the TXD timeout \ntTOTXD ); the CANH driver pulls high and the CANL driver \npulls low. When TXD is high and RS is low, the driver is \nin the recessive state;  both the CANH and CANL driv -\ners are in the Hi-Z state and the bus termination resistor \nequalizes the voltage on CANH and CANL. In the recessive \nstate, the impedance on CANH and CANL is determined \nby the receiver input resistance, R IN. When RS is high the \nLTC2875 is in shutdown; the CANH and CANL drivers are in the Hi-Z state, and the receiver input resistance R\nIN is \ndisconnected from the bus by a FET switch.\nTransmit Dominant Timeout FunctionThe LTC2875 includes a 2ms (typical) timer to limit the \ntime that the transmitter can hold the bus in the dominant \nstate. If TXD is held low, a dominant state is asserted on \nCANH and CANL until the TXD timer times out at t TOTXD , \nafter which the transmitter reverts to the recessive state. The timer is reset when TXD is brought high. The trans -\nmitter asserts a dominant state upon the next TXD low.\nThe \nlowest data rate that can be communicated without \ninterference from the transmit dominant timeout timer is 22kbps, corresponding to 11 consecutive dominant bits \ndivided by a bit time equal to the minimum t TOTXD  value \nof 0.5ms. 11 dominant bits is the maximum allowed by the CAN protocol, consisting of 5 dominant bits followed by an error frame of 6 dominant bits.\nDriver Overvoltage,Overcurrent, and Overtemperature \nProtection\nThe driver outputs are protected from short circuits to any \nvoltage within the absolute maximum range of –60V to \n60V. The maximum current in a fault condition is ± 100mA. \nThe driver includes a progressive foldback current limiting \ncircuit that continuously reduces the driver current limit with increasing output fault voltage. The fault current is typically ±10mA for fault voltages of ±60V.\nThe LTC2875 also features thermal shutdown protection \nthat disables the driver in case of excessive power dis -\nsipation (see Notes 3 and 4). When the die temperature \nexceeds 170°C (typical), the transmitter is forced into the \nrecessive state. The receiver remains operational.\nPower-Up/Down Glitch-Free Outputs\nThe LTC2875 employs a supply undervoltage detection \ncircuit to control the activation of the circuitry on-chip. \nDuring power-up, the CANH, CANL, RXD and SPLIT out-\nputs remain in the high impedance state until the supply \nreaches a voltage sufficient to reliably operate the chip. At this point, the chip activates if RS is low\n. The receiver \noutput goes active after a short delay t ENRX and reflects \nthe state at the CAN bus pins, and the SPLIT output goes \nactive at approximately the same time. The transmitter \npowers up in the transmit dominant timeout state regard -\nless of the state of the TXD pin, and remains in the reces -\nsive state until the first high to low transition on TXD after \nthe TXD enable time t ENTX. This assures that the transmit -\nter does not disturb the bus by glitching to the dominant state during power-up.\nDuring power down, the reverse occurs;  the supply under -\nvoltage detection circuit senses low supply voltage and \nimmediately puts the chip into shutdown. CANH, CANL, RXD, and SPLIT outputs go to the high impedance state. \nThe voltage on RXD is pulled high by the 500k pull-up \nresistor .\nLTC287514\nRev A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nCommon Mode Voltage vs Supply Voltage\nWhen operating from a 5V supply the LTC2875 adheres to \nthe ISO 11898-2 CAN bus standard by maintaining drive \nlevels that are symmetric around V CC/2 = 2.5V. An internal \ncommon mode reference of V CC/2 is buffered to supply \nthe termination of the receiver input resistors. A second \nbuffer with a high voltage tolerant output supplies V CC/2 \nto the SPLIT output.\nWhen operating from a 3.3V supply the 2.5V nominal \ncommon mode voltage specified in the ISO 11898-2 stan -\ndard is too close to the 3.3V supply to provide symmetric drive levels while maintaining the necessary differential \noutput voltage. To maintain driver symmetry the common \nmode reference voltage is lowered during 3.3V operation. \nThe typical output common mode voltage is 1.95V in the dominant state. The internal common mode reference is set to V\nCC/2 + 0.3V = 1.95V to match the dominant state \noutput common mode voltage. This reference is indepen -\ndently buffered to supply the termination of the receiver input resistors and the SPLIT voltage output.\nAs the LTC2875 operates over a very wide common \nmode range, this small shift of –0.55V in the common \nmode when operating from 3.3V does not degrade data \ntransmission or reception. An LTC2875 operating at 3.3V \nmay share a bus with other CAN transceivers operating \nat 5V. However , the electromagnetic emissions may be \nlarger if transceivers powered by different voltages share a bus, due to the fluctuation in the common mode volt -\nage from 1.95V (when an LTC2875 on a 3.3V supply is dominant) to \n2.5V (when a CAN transceiver on a 5V sup -\nply is dominant).\nRS Pin and V\nariable Slew Rate Control\nThe driver features adjustable slew rate for improved EME \nperformance. The slew rate is set by the amount of cur -\nrent that is sourced by the RS pin when it is pulled below \napproximately 1.1V\n. This allows the slew rate to be set \nby a single slew control resistor RSL in series with the RS pin (Figure\xa01).The relationship between the series slew control resistor \nRSL and the transmitter slew rate can be observed in \nFigure\xa010. RSL ≤ 4kΩ is recommended for high data rate \ncommunication. RSL should be less than 200k to ensure \nthat the RS pin can be reliably pulled below V IL_RS  to \nenable the chip.\nFigure\xa010. Slew Rate vs Slew Control Resistor RSL\nFigure\xa011. Equivalent Circuit of RS PinWhen a voltage between 1.1V and V CC is applied, the RS \npin acts as a high impedance receiver . A voltage above \nVIH_RS  puts the chip in shutdown, while a voltage below \nVIL_RS  but above 1.1V  activates the chip and sets the \ntransmitter to the minimum slew rate.RSL (k/uni03A9)SLEW RATE (V/µs)\n2875 F1060\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n1 10 100VCC = 5V\nVCC = 3.3V\nThe slew control circuit on the RS pin is activated at applied \nvoltages below 1.1V.

Below an applied voltage of ~ 0.9V, the slew \ncontrol circuit sources no additional current, and the cur -\nrent drawn from it remains at ~ –100µA down to 0V.\nThe total current I RS drawn from the RS pin for input volt -\nage 0.9V ≤ V RS ≤ 1.1V is the sum of the internal pull-up \nresistor current I RS and the slew control current I SC.\n  IRS(0.9V ≤ V RS≤ 1.1V )= IPU+ ISC\n=VCC– VRS\n250k+1.1V – VRS\n2k\nThe transmitter slew rate is controlled by the slew con -\ntrol current I SC with increasing current magnitude corre -\nsponding to higher slew rates. The slew rate can be con -\ntrolled using a single slew control resistor RSL in series \nwith the RS pin. When the RS pin is pulled low towards \nground by an external driver , RSL limits the amount of \ncurrent drawn from the RS pin and sets the transmitter slew rate. Alternatively, the slew rate may be controlled by an external voltage or current source.\nHigh Symmetry Driver with Variable Slew Rate \nThe electromagnetic emissions spectrum of a differential \nline transmitter is largely determined by the variation in the common mode voltage during switching, as the dif -\nferential component of the emissions from the two lines \ncancel, while the common mode emissions of the two \nlines add. The LTC2875 transmitter has been designed \nto maintain highly symmetric transitions on the CANH \nand CANL lines to minimize the perturbation of the com-\nmon mode voltage during switching (Figure\xa012), resulting \nin low EME. The common mode switching symmetry is guaranteed by the V\nSYM specification.\nIn addition to full compliance with the ISO 11898-2 stan -\ndard, LTC2875 meets the more stringent requirements \nof ISO 11898-5 for bus driver symmetry. This requires \nthat the common mode voltage stay within the limits not only during the static dominant and recessive states, but during the bit transition states as well. Ultra-high speed peak detect circuits are used during manufacturing test to ensure that V\nSYM limits are not exceeded at any point \nduring the switching cycle. \nThe high frequency content may be reduced by choosing \na lower data rate and a slower slew rate for the signal \ntransitions. The LTC2875 provides an approximate 20 to 1  \nreduction in slew rate, with a corresponding decrease in \nthe high frequency content. The lowest slew rate is suit -\nable for data communication at 200kbps or below, while the highest slew rate supports \n4Mbps. The slew rate limit \ncircuit maintains consistent control of transmitter slew \nrates across voltage and temperature to ensure predict-\nable performance under all operating conditions. Figure\xa013 \ndemonstrates the reduction in high frequency content of the common mode voltage achieved by the lowest slew rate compared to the highest slew rate at 200kbps.\nFigure\xa012.

A split terminator divides the single line-\nend termination resistor (nominally 120Ω) into two series \nresistors of half the value of the single termination resistor \n(Figure\xa02). The center point of the two resistors is con -\nnected to a low impedance voltage source that sets the recessive common mode voltage.\nSplit termination suppresses common mode voltage per -\nturbations by providing a low impedance load to common \nmode noise sources such as transmitter noise or coupling \nto external noise sources. In the case of single resistor \ntermination, the only load on a common mode noise \nsource is the parallel impedance of the input resistors of \nthe CAN transceivers on the bus. This results in a com -\nmon mode impedance of several kilohms for a small net -\nwork. The split termination, on the other hand, provides a common mode load equal to the parallel resistance of the two split termination resistors, or \n¼ the resistance of \nthe single termination resistor (30Ω). This low common mode impedance results in a reduction of the common mode noise voltage compared to the much higher com -\nmon mode impedance of the single resistor termination.\nThe SPLIT pin on the LTC2875 provides a buffered voltage \nto bias the mid-point of the split termination resistors. The \nvoltage on the SPLIT pin matches the common mode volt -\nage established by the transmitter in the dominant state and the receiver input resistor bias during the recessive state: V\nCC/2 when V CC = 5V and V CC/2+0.3V when V CC = \n3.3V. Decouple SPLIT with a 4.7nF capacitor to ground to lower the AC impedance to better suppress fast tran -\nsients. SPLIT is a high voltage fault tolerant output that \ntolerates the same ± 60V overvoltage faults and ± 25kV  \nESD discharges as CANH and CANL.\nOne disadvantage of the SPLIT termination is higher power \nsupply current if the two terminating transceivers differ in \ntheir common mode voltage due to differences in V CC or \nGND potential or to chip to chip variations in the internal reference voltages. This will result in the transceiver with the higher common mode voltage sourcing current into the bus lines through its SPLIT pin, while the transceiver with the lower common mode voltage will sink current \nthrough its SPLIT pin.\nIdeal Passive Behavior to CAN Bus With Supply Off\nWhen the power supply is removed or the chip is in shut -\ndown, the CANH and CANL pins are in a high impedance \nstate. The receiver inputs are isolated from the CANH and \nCANL nodes by FET switches which opens in the absence \nof power , thereby preventing the resistor dividers on the receiver input from loading the bus. The high impedance \nstate of the receiver is maintained over a range determined \nby the ESD protection of the receiver input, typically − 0.3V \nto 10V. For bus voltages outside this range, the current flowing into the receiver is governed by the conduction voltages of the ESD device and the 40k nominal receiver \ninput resistance.\nMicropower Shutdown Mode\nThe low power shutdown mode is entered by raising the \nvoltage on the RS pin above its V IH_RS  threshold. This \nturns off all circuits that draw DC bias currents and dis -\nables all chip functionality. Any remaining supply current \nin shutdown is due to semiconductor device leakage cur -\nrents. All the outputs —CANH, CANL, SPLIT , and RXD— are in the high impedance state, with RXD pulled up to V\nCC through a 500kΩ resistor to ensure it remains in the \nrecessive state.\nThe chip is enabled by bringing the RS pin below its V IL_\nRS threshold. The RXD output goes active after the time \ndelay t ENRX (40µs max) and the SPLIT pin goes active at \napproximately the same time. CANH and CANL switch to \nthe dominant state at the first high-to-low transition of \nTXD after the t ENTX delay.\nAuxiliary Protection for IEC Surge, EFT and ESD\nA transceiver used in an industrial setting may be exposed \nto extremely high levels of electrical overstress due to \nphenomena such as lightning surge, electrical fast tran -\nsient (EFT) from switching high current inductive loads, \nand electrostatic discharge (ESD) from the discharge of electrically charged personnel or equipment. T\nest meth -\nods to evaluate immunity of electronic equipment to these \nphenomena are defined in the IEC standards 61000-4-2, \nLTC287517\nRev A For more information www.analog.com61000-4-4, and 61000-4-5, which address ESD, EFT , and \nsurge, respectively. The transients produced by the EFT \nand particularly the surge tests contain much more energy \nthan ESD transients. The LTC2875 is designed for high \nrobustness against ESD, but the on-chip protection is not \nable to absorb the energy associated with the 61000-4-5 \nsurge transients. Therefore, a properly designed external protection network is necessary to achieve a high level of surge protection, and can also extend the ESD and EFT performance of the LTC2875 to extremely high levels.\nIn addition to providing surge, EFT and ESD protection, \nan external network should preserve the ability of the \nLTC2875 to operate over a wide common mode and com -\nmunicate at high frequencies. In order to meet the first \nrequirement, protection components with suitably high \nconduction voltages must be chosen. A means to limit \ncurrent must be provided to prevent damage in case a sec-\nondary protection device or the ESD cell on the LTC2875  \nfires and conducts. The capacitance of these components must be kept low in order to permit high frequency com -\nmunication over a network with multiple nodes. \nThe protection network shown in Figure\xa0\n14 in the Typical \nApplication section provides the following protection:\nIEC 61000-4-2 Edition 2.0 2008-12 ESD Level 4: ± 30kV  \nair , ±15kV contact (line to GND, direct discharge to bus \npins with transceiver and protection circuit mounted \non a ground referenced test card per Figure\xa04 of the standard)\nIEC 61000-4-4 Second Edition 2004-07 EFT Level 4: \n±5kV (line to GND,100kHz repetition rate, 0.75ms burst \nduration, 60 second test duration, discharge coupled \nto bus pins through 100pF  capacitor per paragraph \n7.3.2 of the standard)\nIEC 61000-4-5 Second Edition 2005-11 Surge Level \n4: ±5kV (line to GND, line to line, 8/20µs waveform, \neach line coupled to generator through 80Ω resistor per Figure\xa014 of the standard)This protection circuit adds only ~ 36pF of capacitance \nper line (line to GND), thereby providing an extremely \nhigh level of protection without significant impact to the performance of the LTC2875 at high data rates.\nThe gas discharge tubes (GDTs) provide the primary pro -\ntection against electrical surges. These devices provide a \nver\ny low impedance and high current carrying capability \nwhen they fire, safely discharging the surge current to \nGND. The transient blocking units (TBUs) are solid state devices that switch from a low impedance pass through state to a high impedance current limiting state when a specified current level is reached. These devices limit the current and power that can pass through to the second -\nary protection. The secondary protection consists of a \nbidirectional TVS diode, which avalanches above 36V to protect the bus pins of the LTC2875 transceiver . The high avalanche voltage of the secondary protection maintains a wide common mode range. The final component of the \nnetwork is the metal oxide varistors (MOVs) which are \nused to clamp the voltage across the TBUs to protect \nthem against fast ESD and EFT transients which exceed the turn-on time of the GDT .\nThe high performance of this network is attributable to the low capacitance of the GDT primary protection \ndevices. The high capacitance MOV floats on the line and is shunted by the TBU, so it contributes no appreciable capacitive load on the signal.\nLogic I/O Interface Voltages and Power Supply \nSequencing\nLogic inputs RS and TXD are protected by ground ref -\nerenced ESD devices. These inputs do not draw a high \ncurrent if driven by voltages exceeding V CC as long as \nthe absolute maximum ratings for these pins are not \nexceeded. The V CC supply for the LTC2875 may be safely \nbrought up before or after the supplies powering the \nlogic driving the RXD and TXD inputs with no adverse \nconsequences.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC287518\nRev A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa014.
