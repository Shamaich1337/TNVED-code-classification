As shown in Figure 8-1 , this voltage is applied across resistor R1 to generate a constant current I1. The \ncurrent I ADJ from the adjust pin can introduce error to the output, but because this current is very small (60 μA) \ncompared to the I1 and very constant with line and load changes, the error can be ignored. The constant current \nI1 then flows through the output set resistor R2 and sets the output voltage to the desired level.\nFor fixed voltage devices, R1 and R2 are integrated inside the devices.\nFigure 8-1. Basic Adjustable Regulator\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Load Regulation\nThe LM1117 regulates the voltage that appears between the output and ground pins, or between the output and \nadjust pins. In some cases, line resistances can introduce errors to the voltage across the load. To obtain the \nbest load regulation, a few precautions are needed.\nFigure 8-2  illustrates a typical application using a fixed output regulator. The Rt1 and Rt2 are the line \nresistances. Obviously the V LOAD is less than the V OUT by the sum of the voltage drops along the line \nresistances. In this case, the load regulation at the R LOAD is degraded from the data sheet specification. To \nimprove this degradation, the load must be tied directly to the output terminal on the positive side and directly \ntied to the ground terminal on the negative side.\nwww.ti.comLM1117\nSNOS412Q – FEBRUARY 2000 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: LM1117\nFigure 8-2. Typical Application Using Fixed Output Regulator\nWhen the adjustable regulator is used ( Figure 8-3 ), the best performance is obtained with the positive side of \nthe resistor R1 tied directly to the output terminal of the regulator rather than near the load. This eliminates \nline drops from appearing effectively in series with the reference and degrading regulation. For example, a 5-V \nregulator with 0.05- Ω resistance between the regulator and load has a load regulation resulting from the line \nresistance of 0.05 Ω × IL. If R1 (= 125 Ω) is connected near the load, the effective line resistance is 0.05 Ω (1 + \nR2 / R1) or in this case, four times worse. In addition, the ground side of the resistor R2 can be returned near the \nground of the load to provide remote ground sensing and improve load regulation.\nFigure 8-3. Best Load Regulation Using Adjustable Output RegulatorLM1117\nSNOS412Q – FEBRUARY 2000 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM1117\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Protection Diodes\nUnder normal operation, the LM1117 regulators do not need any protection diode. With the adjustable device, \nthe internal resistance between the adjust and output terminals limits the current. No diode is needed to divert \nthe current around the regulator even with capacitor on the adjust terminal. The adjust pin can take a transient \nsignal of ±25V with respect to the output voltage without damaging the device.\nWhen a output capacitor is connected to a regulator and the input is shorted to ground, the output capacitor \nwill discharge into the output of the regulator. The discharge current depends on the value of the capacitor, the \noutput voltage of the regulator, and rate of decrease of V IN. In the LM1117 regulators, the internal diode between \nthe output and input pins can withstand microsecond surge currents of 10A to 20A. With an extremely large \noutput capacitor (≥1000 µF), and with input instantaneously shorted to ground, the regulator could be damaged.\nIn this case, an external diode is recommended between the output and input pins to protect the regulator, as \nshown in Figure 8-4 .\nFigure 8-4.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe LM1117 is a versatile and high performance linear regulator with a wide temperature range and tight line/\nload regulation operation. An output capacitor is required to further improve transient response and stability. For \nthe adjustable option, the ADJ pin can also be bypassed to achieve very high ripple-rejection ratios. The LM1117 \nis versatile in its applications, including being used as a post regulator for DC/DC converters, battery chargers, \nand microprocessor supplies.\n9.2 Typical Application\nFigure 9-1. 1.25-V to 10-V Adjustable Regulator With Improved Ripple Rejection\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThe device component count is very minimal, employing two resistors as part of a voltage divider circuit \nand an output capacitor for load regulation. A 10- μF tantalum on the input is a suitable input capacitor for \nalmost all applications. An optional bypass capacitor across R2 can also be used to improve PSRR. See the \nRecommended Operating Conditions  table for more information.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nThe output voltage is set based on the selection of the two resistors, R1 and R2, as shown in Figure 9-1 . For \ndetails on capacitor selection, see the External Capacitors  section.\n9.2.2.1 External Capacitors\n9.2.2.1.1 Input Bypass Capacitor\nAn input capacitor is recommended. A 10-µF tantalum on the input is a suitable input capacitor for almost all \napplications.\n9.2.2.1.2 Adjust Terminal Bypass Capacitor\nThe adjust terminal can be bypassed to ground with a bypass capacitor (C ADJ) to improve ripple rejection. This \nbypass capacitor prevents ripple from being amplified as the output voltage is increased. At any ripple frequency, \nthe impedance of the C ADJ must be less than R1 to prevent the ripple from being amplified:LM1117\nSNOS412Q – FEBRUARY 2000 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM1117\n1 / (2π × f RIPPLE  × C ADJ) < R1 (1)\nThe R1 is the resistor between the output and the adjust pin. The value is normally in the range of 100 Ω to 200 \nΩ. For example, with R1 = 124 Ω and f RIPPLE  = 120 Hz, the C ADJ must be > 11µF.\n9.2.2.1.3 Output Capacitor\nThe output capacitor is critical in maintaining regulator stability, and must meet the required conditions for both \nminimum amount of capacitance and equivalent series resistance (ESR). The minimum output capacitance \nrequired by the LM1117 is 10 µF, if a tantalum capacitor is used. Any increase of the output capacitance will \nmerely improve the loop stability and transient response. The ESR of the output capacitor should range between \n0.3 Ω  to 22 Ω. In the case of the adjustable regulator, when the C ADJ is used, a larger output capacitance (22-µF \ntantalum) is required.\n9.2.3 Application Curve\nAs shown in Figure 9-2 , the dropout voltage will vary with output current and temperature. Care should be taken \nduring design to ensure the dropout voltage requirement is met across the entire operating temperature and \noutput current range.\nFigure 9-2.

The circuit diagrams in this section demonstrate multiple \nsystem examples that can be utilized in many applications.\nFigure 9-3. Fixed Output Regulator\nFigure 9-4.

An input capacitor is recommended. For more information regarding capacitor selection, see the \nExternal Capacitors  section.\n9.5 Layout\n9.5.1 Layout Guidelines\nSome layout guidelines must be followed to ensure proper regulation of the output voltage with minimum noise. \nTraces carrying the load current must be wide to reduce the amount of parasitic trace inductance and the \nfeedback loop from V OUT to ADJ must be kept as short as possible. To improve PSRR, a bypass capacitor can \nbe placed at the ADJ pin and must be located as close as possible to the IC. In cases when V IN shorts to \nground, an external diode must be placed from V OUT to V IN to divert the surge current from the output capacitor \nand protect the IC. The diode must be placed close to the corresponding IC pins to increase their effectiveness.\n9.5.1.1 Heat Sink Requirements\nWhen an integrated circuit operates with an appreciable current, the junction temperature is elevated. The \nthermal limits must be quantified in order to achieve acceptable performance and reliability. This limit is \ndetermined by summing the individual parts consisting of a series of temperature rises from the semiconductor \njunction to the operating environment. A one-dimensional steady-state model of conduction heat transfer is \ndemonstrated in Figure 9-9 . The heat generated at the device junction flows through the die to the die attach \npad, through the lead frame to the surrounding case material, to the printed circuit board, and eventually to the \nambient environment. Below is a list of variables that may affect the thermal resistance and in turn the need for a \nheat sink.\nTable 9-1.

Under all \npossible operating conditions, the junction temperature of the LM1117 must be within the range of 0°C to \n+125°C. A heat sink can be required depending on the maximum power dissipation and maximum ambient \ntemperature of the application. To determine if a heat sink is needed, the power dissipated by the regulator, P D , \nmust be calculated:\nIIN = IL + IG (2)\nPD = (V IN-VOUT)I L + V INIG (3)\nFigure 9-10  shows the voltages and currents which are present in the circuit.\nFigure 9-10. Power Dissipation Diagram\nThe next parameter which must be calculated is the maximum allowable temperature rise, T R(max):\n\u2003T R(max) = T J(max)-T A(max) (4)\nwhere\n•TJ(max) is the maximum allowable junction temperature (125°C) which is encountered in the application\n•TA(max) is the maximum ambient temperature which is encountered in the application\nUsing the calculated values for T R(max) and P D, the maximum allowable value for the junction-to-ambient \nthermal resistance (R θJA) can be calculated:\nRθJA = T R(max) / P D (5)\nFor the maximum allowable value for θ JA, see the Thermal Information  table.\nAs a design aid, Table 9-2  shows the value of the θJA of SOT-223 and TO-252 for different heat sink area. Figure \n9-11 and Figure 9-12  reflects the same test results as what are in the Table 9-2\nFigure 9-13  and Figure 9-14  shows the maximum allowable power dissipation vs. ambient temperature for the \nSOT-223 and TO-252 device. Figure 9-15  and Figure 9-16  shows the maximum allowable power dissipation vs. \ncopper area (in2) for the SOT-223 and TO-252 devices.

TI may\nreference these types of products as "Pb-Free".\nRoHS Exempt:  TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.\nGreen: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (Cl) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold.  Antimony trioxide based\nflame retardants must also meet the <=1000ppm threshold requirement.\n \n(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.\n \nAddendum-Page 3\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 21-Sep-2023\n(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.\n \n(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation\nof the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.\n \n(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two\nlines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.\n \nImportant Information and Disclaimer: The information provided on this page represents TI\'s knowledge and belief as of the date that it is provided.
