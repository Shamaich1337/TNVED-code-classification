A  \n11/06/2015  \nGEN ERAL DESCRIPTION \n \nThe IS25LP 064A/032A  Serial Flash memory offers a versatile storage solution with high flexibility and \nperformance in a simplified pin count package. ISSI’s “Indus try Standard Serial Interface” F lash are for systems \nthat require limited space, a low pin count, and low power consumption . The device  is accessed through a 4 -\nwire SPI Interface consisting of a Serial Data Input ( SI), Serial Data Output (SO), Serial Clock (SCK), and Chip \nEnable (CE#) pins, which can also be conf igured to serve as multi -I/O (see pin descriptions).  \n \nThe device supports Dual and Quad I/O as well as standard, Dual Output, and Quad Output SPI. Clock \nfrequencies of up to 133MHz allow for equivalent clock rates of up to 532MHz (133MHz x 4) which equates  to \n66Mbytes/s of data throughput. The IS25xP series of Flash adds support for DTR  (Double Transfer  Rate ) \ncommands that transfer addresses and read data on both edges of the clock.  These transfer rates can \noutperform 16 -bit Parallel Flash memories allowing  for efficient memory access to support XIP (execute in \nplace) operation.  \n \nThe memory array is organized into programmable pages of 256 -bytes. This family supports page program \nmode where 1 to 256 bytes of data are programmed in a single command. QPI (Quad  Peripheral Interface) \nsupports 2 -cycle instruction further reducing instruction times. Pages can be erased in groups of 4Kbyte \nsectors, 32Kbyte blocks, 64Kbyte blocks, and/or the entire chip. The uniform sector and block architecture \nallows for a high deg ree of flexibility so that the device can be utilized for a broad variety of applications \nrequiring solid data retention.  \n \nGLOSSARY  \n \nStandard  SPI \nIn this operation, a 4 -wire SPI Interface is utilized, consisting of Serial Data Input  (SI), Serial Data Output (SO), \nSerial Clock (SCK), and Chip Enable (CE#) pins. Instructions are sent via the SI pin to encode instructions, \naddresses, or input data to the device on the rising edge of SCK. The SO pin is used to read data or to check the \nstatu s of the device . This device supports SPI bus operation modes (0,0) and (1,1).  \n \nMulti  I/O SPI \nMulti -I/O operation utilizes an  enhanced SPI protocol to allow the device to function with Dual Output, Dual Input \nand Output, Quad Output, and Quad Input and Output capability. Executing these instructions through SPI \nmode will achieve double or quadruple the transfer bandwidth for READ and PROGRAM operations.  \n \nQPI \nThe device supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations only when the device is switched from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the enter QPI (35h) instruction. The typical SPI protocol \nrequires that the byte -long instruction code being shifted into the device only via SI pin in eight serial clocks. The \nQPI mode utilizes all four I /O pins to input the instruction code thus requiring only two serial clocks. This can \nsignificantly reduce the SPI instruction overhead and improve system performance. Only QPI mode or \nSPI/Dual/Quad mode can be active at any given time. Enter QPI (35h) and  Exit QPI (F5h) instructions are used \nto switch between these two modes, regardless of the non -volatile Quad Enable (QE) bit status in the Status \nRegister. Power Reset or Hardware/Software Reset will return the device into the standard SPI mode. SI and \nSO pins become bidirectional I/O0 and I/O1, and WP# and HOLD# pins become I/O2 and I/O3 respectively \nduring QPI mode.   \n \nDTR \nIn addition to SPI and QPI features, the device  also supports Fast READ  DTR operation, which allows high data \nthroughput while running at lower clock frequencies. DTR READ mode uses both rising and falling edges of the \nclock to drive output, resulting in reducing input and output  cycles by half.  \n \n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        4   \nRev.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \nFor the device  without dedicated  RESET# function  option  on pin3 /ball A4  \nSYMBOL  TYPE  DESCRIPTION  \nCE# INPUT  Chip Enable:  The Chip Enable (CE#) pin enables and disables the devices \noperation. When CE# is high the device is deselected and output pins are in a high \nimpedance state.  When deselected the devices non -critical internal circuitry power \ndown to allow minimal levels of power consum ption while in a standby state.  \nWhen CE# is pulled low the device will be selected and brought out of standby \nmode. The device is considered active and instructions can be written to, data read, \nand written to the device. After power -up, CE#  must transition from high to low \nbefore a new instruction will be accepted.  \nKeeping CE# in a high state deselects the device and switches it into its low power \nstate.  Data will not be accepted when CE# is high.  \nSI (IO0),  \nSO (IO1)  INPUT/OUTPUT  Serial Data Input, Serial Output, and IOs (SI, SO, IO0, and IO1):  \nThis device supports standard SPI, Dual SPI, and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI \ninstructions use the unidirectional SI (Serial Input) pin to write instructions, \naddresses, or data to the device o n the rising edge of the Serial Clock (SCK). \nStandard SPI also uses the unidirectional SO (Serial Output) to read data or status \nfrom the device on the falling edge of the serial clock (SCK).  \nIn Dual and Quad SPI mode, SI and SO become bidirectional IO pin s to write \ninstructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of the Serial Clock \n(SCK) and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of SCK. Quad SPI \ninstructions use the WP# and HOLD# pins as IO2 and IO3 respectively.  \nWP# (IO 2)  INPUT/OUTPUT  Write Protect/Serial Data IO (IO2):  The WP# pin protects the Status Register from \nbeing written in conjunction with the SRWD bit. When the SRWD is set to “1” and the \nWP# is pulled low, the Status Reg ister bits (SRWD, QE, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0)  are \nwrite -protected and vice -versa for WP# high. When the SRWD is set to “0”, the \nStatus Register is not write -protected regardless of WP# state.  \nWhen the QE bit is set to “1”, the WP# pin (Write Protect) function is not available \nsince this pin is us ed for IO2.  \nHOLD# (IO3) or \nRESET#  (IO3) INPUT/OUTPUT  HOLD# or RESET#/Serial Data IO (IO3):  When the QE bit of Status Register is set \nto “1”, HOLD# pin or RESET# is not available since it becomes IO3. When QE=0, \nthe pin acts as HOLD# or RESET# and either one can be selected by the P7 bit \nsetting in Read Register. HOLD# will be selected if P7=0 (Default) and RESET# will \nbe selected if P7=1 . \nThe HOLD# pin allows the device to be paused while it is selected. It p auses serial \ncommunication by the master device without resetting the serial sequence. The \nHOLD# pin is active low. When HOLD# is in a low state and CE# is low, the SO pin \nwill be at high impedance. Device operation can resume when HOLD# pin is brought \nto a high state.  \nRESET# pin is a hardware RESET signal.

SPI MODES DESCRIPTION  \nMultiple IS25L P064A/032A  devices can be connected on the SPI serial bus and controlled by a SPI Master, i.e. \nmicrocontroller, as shown in Figure 4.1. The devices support either of two SPI modes:  \n \nMode 0 (0, 0)  \nMode 3 (1, 1)  \n \nThe difference between these two modes is the clock pol arity. When the SPI master is in stand-by mode , the \nserial clock remains at “0” (SCK = 0) for Mode 0 and the clock remains at “1” (SCK = 1) for Mode 3.  Please refer \nto Figure 4.2 and Figure 4 .3 for SPI and QPI mode.  In both modes, the input data is latched on the rising edge \nof Serial Clock (SCK), and the output data is available from the falling edge of SCK.  \n \nFigure 4.1 Connection Diagram among SPI Master and SPI Slaves (Memory Devices)  \n \nNote s: \n1.

REGISTERS  \nThe IS25LP064A/032A  has three sets of Registers: Status, Function and Read.  \n6.1 STATUS REGISTER  \nStatus Register Format and Status Register Bit Definitions  are described in Table  6.1 & Table 6.2. \n \nTable 6.1  Status Register Format  \n Bit 7  Bit 6  Bit 5  Bit 4  Bit 3  Bit 2  Bit 1  Bit 0  \n SRWD  QE BP3 BP2 BP1 BP0 WEL  WIP \nDefault  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n \nTable 6.2  Status Register Bit Definition  \nBit Name  Definition  Read - \n/Write  Type  \nBit 0 WIP Write In Progress Bit:  \n"0" indicates the device is ready (default)  \n"1" indicates a write cycle is in progress and the device is busy  R Volatile  \nBit 1 WEL  Write Enable Latch:  \n"0" indicates the device is not write enabled (default)  \n"1" indicates the device is write enabled  R/W1 Volatile  \nBit 2 BP0 \nBlock Protection Bit: (See Table 6.4 for details)  \n"0" indicates the specific blocks are not write -protected (default)  \n"1" indicates the specific blocks are write -protected  R/W Non-Volatile  Bit 3 BP1 \nBit 4 BP2 \nBit 5 BP3 \nBit 6 QE Quad Enable bit:  \n“0” indicates the Quad output function disable (default)  \n“1” indicates the Quad output function enable  R/W Non-Volatile  \nBit 7 SRWD  Status Register Write Disable: (See Table 7.1 for details)  \n"0" indicates the Status Register is not write -protected (default)  \n"1" indicates the Status Register is write -protected  R/W Non-Volatile  \nNote1: WEL bit can be written by WREN and WRDI commands, but cannot by WRSR command.  \n \nThe BP0, BP1, BP2, BP3, QE, and SRWD are non-volatile memory cells that can be written by a Write Status \nRegister (WRSR) instruction. The default value of the BP0, BP1, BP2, BP3, QE, and SRWD bits were set to “ 0” \nat factory. The Status Register can be read by the Read Status Register (RDSR).  \n \nThe function of Status Register bits are described as follows:  \n \nWIP bit : The Write In Progress (WIP) bit is read -only, and can be used to detect the progress or completion of a \nprogram or erase operation. When the WIP bit is “0”, the device is ready for write Status Reg ister, program or \nerase operation. When the WIP bit is “1”, the device is busy.  \n \nWEL bit : The Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit indicates the status of the internal write enable latch. When the \nWEL is “0”, the write enable latch is disabled and the write operations described in Table 6.3 are inhibited. When \nthe WEL bit is “1”, the write ope rations are allowed. The WEL bit is set by a Write Enable (WREN) instruction. \nEach write register, program and erase instruction except for Set Read Register must be preceded by a WREN \ninstruction. The WEL bit can be reset by a Write Disable (WRDI) instruc tion. It will automatically reset after the \ncompletion of any write operation . \n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        16   \nRev.

Refer to T able 6.4 for the Block Write Protection  (BP) bit settings. When a \ndefined combination of BP3, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits are set, the corresponding memory area is protected. Any \nprogram or erase operation to that area will be inhibited.  \nNote:  A Chip Erase (C ER) instruction will be ignored  unless  all the Block Protection Bits are “0”s.  \n \nSRWD  bit: The Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit operates in conjunction with the Write Protection \n(WP#) signal to provide a Hardware Protection Mode. When the SRWD is set to “0”, the Status Register is not \nwrite -protected. When the SRWD is set to “1” and the WP# is pulled low (V IL), the  bits of Status Register \n(SRWD, QE, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) become read -only, and a WRSR instruction will be ignored. If the SRWD is \nset to “1” and WP# is pulled high (V IH), the S tatus Register can be changed by a WRSR instruction.  \n \nQE bit : The Quad Enable (QE) is a non -volatile bit in t he Status Reg ister that allows quad operation. When the \nQE bit is set to “0”, the pin WP# and HOLD# are enable d. When the QE bit is set to “1”, the IO2 and IO3 pins \nare enable d. \n \nWARNING: The QE bit must  be set to 0 if WP# or HOLD#  pin is tied directly to the power supply.  \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        17   \nRev.

All instructions, addresses, and data are shifted in with the most significant bit \n(MSB) first  on Serial Data Input (SI) or Serial Data IOs (IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3). The input data on SI or IOs is \nlatched on the rising  edge of Serial Clock (SCK) for normal mode and both of rising and falling edges for DTR \nmode after Chip Enable (CE#) is driven low (V IL). Every instruction sequence starts with a one -byte instruction \ncode and is followed by address bytes, data bytes, or b oth address bytes and data bytes, depending on the type \nof instruction. CE# must be driven high (V IH) after the last bit of the instruction sequence has been shifted in to \nend the operation.  \n \nTable 8.1  Instruction Set  \nInstruction  \nName  Operation  Mode  Byte0  Byte1  Byte2  Byte3  Byte4  Byte5  Byte6  \nNORD  Normal Read  \nMode  SPI 03h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Data out      \nFRD Fast Read  \nMode  SPI \nQPI 0Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Data out    \nFRDIO  Fast Read  \nDual I/O  SPI BBh A \n<23:16>  \nDual A \n<15:8>  \nDual A \n<7:0>  \nDual AXh(1),(2) \nDual Dual \nData out    \nFRDO  Fast Read  \nDual Output  SPI 3Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Dual \nData out    \nFRQIO  Fast Read  \nQuad I/O  SPI \nQPI EBh A \n<23:16>  \nQuad  A \n<15:8>  \n Quad  A \n<7:0>  \nQuad  AXh(1), (2) \nQuad  Quad  \nData out    \nFRQO  Fast Read  \nQuad Output  SPI 6Bh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Quad  \nData out   \nFRDTR  Fast Read  \nDTR Mode  SPI \nQPI 0Dh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Dummy(1) \nByte Dual \nData out    \nFRDDTR  Fast Read  \nDual I/O DTR  SPI BDh A \n<23:16>  \nDual A \n<15:8>  \nDual A \n<7:0>  \nDual AXh(1), (2) \nDual Dual \nData out    \nFRQDTR  Fast Read  \nQuad I/O DTR  SPI \nQPI EDh A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  AXh(1), (2) \nQuad  Quad  \nData out    \nPP Input Page  \nProgram  SPI \nQPI 02h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  PD \n(256byte)     \nPPQ  Quad Input  \nPage Program  SPI  32h \n38h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>  Quad PD  \n(256byte)      \nSER Sector Erase  SPI \nQPI D7h \n20h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nBER32 \n(32Kb)  Block Erase  \n32K SPI \nQPI 52h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nBER64 \n(64Kb)  Block Erase  \n64K SPI \nQPI D8h A \n<23:16>  A \n<15:8>  A \n<7:0>        \nCER  Chip Erase  SPI \nQPI C7h \n60h             \nWREN  Write Enable  SPI \nQPI 06h             \nWRDI  Write Disable  SPI \nQPI 04h             \nRDSR  Read Status  \nRegister  SPI \nQPI 05h SR           \nWRSR  Write Status  \nRegister  SPI \nQPI 01h WSR  \nData            \n \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        23   \nRev.

A  \n11/06/2015  \n8.1 NORMAL READ OPERATIO N (NORD, 03h) \nThe NORMAL READ  (NORD) instruction is used to read memory contents of the IS25LP064A/032A  at a \nmaximum frequency of 50MHz.  \n \nThe NORD instruction code is transmitted via the SI line, followed by three address bytes (A23 - A0) of the first \nmemory location to be read. A total of 24 address bits are shifted in , but only AMSB (most significant  bit) - A0 are \ndecoded. The remaining bits (A23 – AMSB+1) are ignored.  The first byte addre ssed can be at any memory \nlocation. Upon completion, any data on the SI will be ignored. Refer to Table 8. 2 for the related Address Key.  \n \nThe first byte data (D7 - D0) is shifted out on the SO line, MSB first. A single byte of data, or up to the whole \nmemory array, can be read out in one NORMAL READ instruction. The address is automatically incremented by \none after each byte of data is shift ed out. The read operation can be terminated at any time by driving CE# high \n(VIH) after the data comes out. When the highest address of the device is reached, the address counter will roll \nover to the 000000h address, allowing the entire memory to be read  in one continuous READ instruction.  \nIf the NORMAL READ instruction is issued while  an Erase, Program or Write operation is in process  (WIP=1) \nthe instruction is ignored and will not have  any effects on the current operation.  \n \nTable 8.2  Address Key  \nAddress  IS25LP 064A IS25LP 032A  \nAMSB – A0 A23 - A0 (A23=X)  A23 - A0 (A23,A22=X)  \nX=Don’t Care  \n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        25   \nRev.

When the highest ad dress is reached, the address counter will roll over to the \n000000h address, allowing the entire memory to be read with a single FAST  READ instruction.

A  \n11/06/2015  \n8.3 HOLD OPERATION  \nHOLD# is used in conjunction with CE# to select the IS25LP064A/032A . When the de vice is selected and a \nserial sequence is  underway, HOLD# can be used to pause  the serial communication with the master device \nwithout resetting the serial sequence. To pause, HOLD# is brought low while the SCK signal is low. To resume \nserial communication, HOLD# is brought high while the SCK signal is low (SCK may still toggle duri ng HOLD). \nInputs to SI will be ignored while SO is in the high impedance state , during HOLD . \nNote:  HOLD is not supported in DTR mode  or with QE=1  or for the specific parts that do not have HOLD# pin.  \n \nTiming graph can be refere nced in AC Parameters Figure 9.4 \n \n8.4 FAST READ DUAL I/O  OPERATION  (FRDIO, BBh) \nThe FRDIO allows the address bits to be input two bits at a time. This may allow for code to be executed directly \nfrom the SPI in some applications.  \n \nThe FRDIO instruction code is followed by three address bytes (A23 – A0) and dummy cycles  (configurable, \ndefault is 4 clocks), transmitted via the IO 1 and IO 0 lines, with each pair of bits latched -in during the rising edge \nof SCK. The address MSB  is input on IO1, the next bit on IO0, and this shift pattern cont inues to alternate \nbetween the two lines. Depending on the usage of AX read operation mode, a mode byte may be located after \naddress input . \n \nThe first data byte addressed is shifted out on the IO1 and IO0 lines, with each pair of bits shifted out at a \nmaxi mum frequency f CT, during the falling edge of SCK. The MSB  is output on IO1, while simultaneously the \nsecond bit is output on IO0. Figure 8.4 illustrates the timing sequence.  \n \nThe first byte addressed can be at any memory location. The address is automatically incremented  by one  after \neach byte of data is shifted out. When the highest address is reached, the address counter will roll over to the \n000000h address, allowing the entire memory to be read with a single FRDIO instruction. FRDIO instruction is \nterminated by driving CE# h igh (V IH). \n \nThe device supports the AX read  operation by applying mode bits  during dummy period . Mode bits consist of 8 \nbits, such as  M7 to M0.  Four cycles after address input are reserved for Mode bits in FRDIO execution . M7 to \nM4 are important for enabli ng this mode.  M3 to M0 become don’t care for future use.  When M[7:4]=1010(A h), it \nenables the AX read operation and subsequent FRDIO execution skips command code. It saves cycles as \ndescribed in Figure 8.5. When the code is different from A Xh (where X is don’t care ), the device exits the AX \nread operation . After finishing the read operation, device  becomes ready to receive a new command. SPI or QPI \nmode configuration retains the prior setting.  Mode bit must be applied during dummy cycles. Number of dummy \ncycle in Table 6.10  includes number of mode bit cycles.  If dummy cycles is configured as 4 cycles, data output \nwill starts right after mode bit applied.  \n \nIf the FRDIO  instruction is issued while  an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process  (WIP=1) the instruction is \nignored and will not affect  the current cycle . \n \n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        29   \nRev.

This may allow for code to be \nexecuted directly from the SPI in some applications.  \n \nThe FRQIO instruction code is followed by three address bytes (A23 – A0) and dummy cycles  (configurable, \ndefault is 6 clocks), transmitted via the IO3, IO2, IO 1 and IO 0 lines, with each group of four bits latched -in during \nthe rising edge of SCK. The address  of MSB  input s on IO3, the next bit on IO2, the next bit on IO1, the next bit \non IO0, and continue to shift in alternating on the four. Depending on the usage of AX read operation mode, a \nmode byte may be located after address input.  \n \nThe first data byte addressed is shifted out on the IO3, IO2, IO1 and IO0 lines, with each group of four bits \nshifted out at a maximum frequency f CT, during the falling edge of SCK. The f irst bit ( MSB ) is output on IO3, \nwhile simultaneously the second bit is output on IO2, the third bit is output on IO1, etc. Figure 8.8 illustrates the \ntiming sequence.  \n \nThe first byte addressed can be at any memory location. The address is automatically in cremented after each \nbyte of data is shifted out. When the highest address is reached, the address counter will roll over to the \n000000h address, allowing the entire memory to be read with a single FRQIO instruction. FRQIO instruction is \nterminated by driv ing CE# high (V IH). \n \nThe device supports the AX read  operation by applying mode bits during dummy period. Mode bits consists of 8 \nbits, such as M7 to M0. Two cycles after address input are reserved for Mode bits in FRQIO execution. M7 to \nM4 are important for enabling this mode. M3 to M0 become don’t care for future use. When M[7:4]=1010(Ah), it \nenables the AX read  operation and subsequent FRQIO execution skips  command code. It saves cycles as \ndescribed in Figure 8.9. When the code is different from AXh  (where X is don’t care ), the device exits the AX \nread operation. After finishing the read operation, device becomes ready to receive a new command. SPI or QPI \nmode configuration retains the prior setting. Mode bit must be applied during dummy cycles. Number of dummy \ncycle in Table 6.10  includes number of mode bit cycles. If dummy cycles is configured as 6 cycles, data output \nwill starts right after mode bit s and 4  additional dummy cycles  are applied . \n \nIf the FRQIO  instruction is issued while  an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process  (WIP=1) the instruction is \nignored and will not have  any effects on the current cycle . \n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        35   \nRev.

As a result, 6 command cycles will be reduced by the FRQIO QPI instruction. In \naddition, subsequent address and data out are shifte d in/out via all four IO lines like the FRQIO instruction.

The internal control logic automa tically handles the programming voltages and timing. During a \nprogram operation, all instructions will be ignored except the RDSR instruction. The progress or completion of \nthe program operation can be determined by reading the WIP bit in Status Register v ia a RDSR instruction.

A  \n11/06/2015  \nRead with “8/16/32/64 -Byte Wrap Around”  \n \nThe device is capable of burst read with wrap around in both SPI and QPI mode. The size of burst length is \nconfigurable by using P0, P1, and P2 bits in R ead Register. P2 bit  (Wrap enable) enables the burst  mode \nfeature. P0 and P1 define  the size of burst. Burst lengths of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bytes are supported. By default, \naddress increases by one up t hrough the entire  array. By setting the burst length, the data being accessed can \nbe limited to the length of burst boundary within a  256 byte page. The first output will be the data at the initial \naddress which is specified in the instruction. Following data will come out  from the next address within the  burst \nboundary. Once the address reaches the end of boundary, it will automatically move  to the first addres s of the \nboundary. CE# high will terminate the command.  \n \nFor example, if burst length of 8 and initial address being applied is 0h, following byte output will be from \naddress 00h and continue to 01h,..,07h, 00h, 01h… until CE# terminate s the operation. If burst length of 8 and \ninitial address being applied is FEh(254 d), following byte output will be from address FEh and continue to FFh, \nF8h, F9h,  FAh,  FBh,  FCh,  FDh, and repeat from FEh  until CE# terminate s the operation.  \n \nThe command, “SET READ PARAMETERS OPERATION  (C0h)”, is used to configure the b urst length. If the \nfollowing data input is one of “00h”,”01h”,”02h”, and ”03h”, the device will be in default operation mode. It will be \ncontinuous burst read of  the whole array. If the following data input is o ne of “04h”,”05h”,”06h”, and ”07h”, the \ndevice will set the burst length as 8,16,32 and 64 respectively.  \n \nTo exit the burst mode , another “C0 h” command  is necessary to set P2 to 0. Otherwise, the burst mode  will be \nretained until either power down or reset  operation . To change burst length , another “C0 h” command should be \nexecuted to set P0 and P1 (Detail ed information in Table 6.8 Burst Length Data). All read commands operate in  \nburst  mode  once  the R ead Register is set to enable burst  mode . \n \nRefer to Figures 8.40  and 8.4 1 for instruction sequence.  \n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        59   \nRev.

The ID number can be used in conjunction with user software methods to help prevent \ncopying or cloning of a system. The RDUID ins truction  is instated by driving the CE# pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code (4Bh) followed by 3 address bytes and a dummy byte.

A  \n11/06/2015  \n8.31 SOFTWARE  RESET  (RESET -ENABLE  (RSTEN , 66h) AND RESET  (RST , 99h)) AND HARDWARE RESET  \nThe Software Reset operation is used as a system reset that puts the device in normal operating mode. During \nthe Reset operation, the value of volatile registers will default back to the value in the corresponding non -volatile \nregister. This operation consists of two c ommands: Reset -Enable (RSTEN) and Reset (RST). The operation \nrequires the Reset -Enable command followed by the Reset command. Any command other than the Reset \ncommand after the Reset -Enable command will disable the Reset -Enable.  \n \nExecute the CE# pin low  \uf0e0 sends the Reset -Enable command (66 h), and drives CE# high. Next, the host drives \nCE# low again, sends the Reset command (99 h), and pulls C E# high.  \n \nOnly for the  parts that have the RESET#  function  option , Hardware Reset function is available. For all packages \nwith RESET# (IO3)  option except 16 -pin SOIC/24 -ball TFBGA with dedicated  RESET# function , the RESET# \npin will be solely applicable in SPI mode and when the QE bit is disabled. For 16 -pin SOIC/24 -ball TFBGA  \npackage s with dedicated  RESET# fu nction , the RESET# pin  (or ball)  is always applicable regardless of the QE \nbit value.  \n \nThe dedicated RESET# pin  (or ball)  has an internal pull -up resistor and may be left floating if not used  The \nRESET# pin  (or ball)  has the highest priority among all the input signals and will reset the device to its initial \npower -on state  regardless of the state of all other pins ( CE#, IOs, SCK , and WP#) . \n \nIn order to activate Hardware Reset , the RESET# pin (or ball)  must be driven  low for a minimum period of tRESET \n(1µs). Drive RESET# low for a minimum period of tRESET will interrupt any on -going internal and external \noperations , release the device from deep power down mode1, disable all input signals , force the output pin enter \na state of high impedance, and reset all the read parameters.  If the RESET# pulse is driven  for a period shorter \nthan 1µs, it may still reset the device, however the 1µs minimum period is recommended to ensure the reliable \nopera tion. The required wait time after activating a HW Reset before the device will accept another instruction \n(tHWRST ) is the same as the maximum value of tSUS (100µs). \n \nThe Software/Hardware R eset during an active Program or Erase operation aborts the operation, which can \nresult in corrupting or losing the data of the targeted address range. Depending on the prior operation, the reset \ntiming may vary. Recovery from a Write operation will require more latency than recovery from other operations.  \nNote 1: The Status and Function Registers remain unaffected.  \n \nFigure 8.50  Software Reset Enable and Software Reset Sequence  (RSTEN, 66h + RST, 99h)  \n \nInstruction = 66hCE#\nSCK\nSI0 1Mode 3\nMode 02 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction = 99h8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nSOHigh Impedance\n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        66   \nRev.

A  \n11/06/2015  \n8.34 INFORMATION ROW PROG RAM  OPERATION  (IRP, 62h) \nThe Information Row Program (IRP) instruction allows up to 256 bytes  data to be programmed into the memory \nin a single operation. Before the execution of IRP instruction, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) must be enabled \nthrough a W rite Enable (WREN) instruction.  \n \nThe IRP instruction code, three address bytes and program data (1 to 256 bytes) should be sequentially input. \nThree address bytes has to be input as specified in the Table 8.6 Information Row Valid Address Range . \nProgram operation will start once the CE# goes  high, otherwise the IRP instruction will not be executed. The \ninternal control logic automatically handles the programming voltages and timing. During a program operation, \nall instructions will be ignored except the RDSR instruction. The progress or completio n of the program \noperation can be determined by reading the WIP bit in Status Register via a RDSR instruction. If the WIP bit is \n“1”, the program operation is still in progress. If WIP bit is “0”, the program operation has completed.  \n \nIf more than 256 byte s data are sent to a device, the address counter rolls over within the same page . The \npreviously latched data are discarded and the last 256 bytes data are kept to be programmed into the page. The \nstarting byte can be anywhere within the page.  When the en d of the page is reached, the address will wrap \naround to the beginning of the same page. If the data to be programmed are less than a full page, the data of all \nother bytes on the same page will remain unchanged.  \nNote: A program operation can alter “1”s i nto “0”s, but an erase operation is required to change “0”s back to “1”s. \nA byte cannot be reprogrammed without first erasing the corresponding Information Row array which is one \nof IR0~3.  \n \nFigure 8.53  IRP (Information Row Program) Sequence  \n \nInstruction = 62h 23CE#\nSCK\nSI7 6\nSO73-byte Address\nHigh Impedance22...0Data In 1 Data In 2560 1 ... 7 8 9 ... 31 32 33 ... 39 ...\n2072\n...\n2079\nMode 3\nMode 0\n...0... ...0\n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        69   \nRev. A  \n11/06/2015  \n8.35 INFORMATION ROW READ  OPERATION  (IRRD,  68h) \nThe IRRD  instruction is used to read memory data at up to a 1 33MHz clock.  \n \nThe IRRD  instruction code is followed by three address bytes (A23 - A0) and a dummy byte , transmitted via the \nSI line, with each bit latched -in during the rising edge of SCK. Then the first data byte addressed is shifted out \non the SO line, with each bit shifted out at a maximum frequency f CT, during the falling edge of SCK.  \n \nThe address is automatically incremented by one after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the address \nreaches the last address of each 256 byte Information Row, the next address will not be valid and the data of \nthe address will be garbage data. It is r ecommended to repeat four times IRRD operation that reads 256 byte \nwith a valid starting address of each Information Row in order to read all data in the 4 x 256 byte Information \nRow array. The IRRD  instruction is terminated by driving CE# high (VIH).  \n \nIf an IRRD  instruction is issued while  an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process  (WIP=1) the instruction is \nignored and will not have  any effects on the current cycle . \n \nThe sequence of IRRD instruction is same as FAST READ except for the instruction code .

The address is latched on both rising and falling edge of SCK, and data of each bit shifts out on both \nrising and falling edge of SCK at a maximum frequenc y fC2. The 2 -bit address can be latched -in at one clock, \nand 2 -bit data can be read out at one clock, which means one bit at the rising edge of clock, the other bi t at the \nfalling edge of clock.  \n \nThe first address byte can be at any location. The address i s automatically increased to the next higher address \nafter each byte of data is shifted out, so the whole memory can be read out in a single FRDTR instruction.

Eventually this operation is same as the FRQDTR QPI, but the only different thing \nis that AX mode is not available in the FRDTR QPI operatio n.  \n \nThe sequence of issuing FRDTR QPI instruction is: CE# goes low \uf0e0 Sending FRDTR QPI instruction (4 -bit per \nclock) \uf0e0 24-bit address interleave on IO3, IO2, IO1 & IO0 (8-bit per clock) \uf0e0 3 dummy clocks (configurable , \ndefault is 3 clocks )  \uf0e0 Data out inte rleave on IO3, IO2, IO1 & IO0 (8-bit per clock) \uf0e0 End FRDTR QPI operation \nby driving CE# high at any time during data out.  \n \nIf the FRDTR QPI instruction is issued while a Program/Erase/Write Status Register cycle is in progress \n(WIP=1), the instruction wil l be rejected without any effect on the current cycle.  \n \nFigure 8.56  FRDTR  QPI Sequence  \n \nInstruction\n= 0DhCE#\nSCK\n3-byte Address0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12Mode 3\nMode 0\ntV\n201612\n51 21171340IO0\nIO1\n221814\n231915840\n951\n1062\n11733 Dummy Cycles\nIO2\nIO362\n735140\n62\n73Data\nOutData\nOut...\n4 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 35140\n62\n73Data\nOut\n5140\n62\n73Data\nOut\n5140\n62\n73Data\nOut\n......\n...\n...\n \nNotes:  \n1.

The \naddress (interleave on dual I/O pins) is latched on both rising and fall ing edge of SCK, and the data (interleave \non dual I/O pins) shift out on both rising and falling edge of SCK at a maximum frequency f T2. The 4 -bit address \ncan be latched -in at one clock, and 4 -bit data can be read out at one clock, which means two bits at the rising \nedge of clock, the other two bits at the falling edge of clock.  \n \nThe first address byte can be at any location. The address is automatically increased to the next higher address \nafter each byte of data is shifted out, so the whole memory can be read out with a single FRDDTR instruction. \nThe address counter rolls over to 0 when the highest ad dress is reached. Once writing FRDDTR instruction, the \nfollowing address/dummy/data out will perform as 4 -bit instead of previous 1 -bit. \n \nThe sequence of iss uing FRDDTR instruction is: CE# goes low \uf0e0 Sending FRDDTR instruction (1 -bit per clock) \n\uf0e0 24-bit address interleave on IO1 & IO0 (4-bit per clock) \uf0e0 2 dummy clocks (configurable  default is 2 clocks ) \non IO1 & IO0 \uf0e0 Data out inte rleave on IO1 & IO0 (4-bit pe r clock) \uf0e0 End FRDDTR operation via pulling CE# \nhigh at any time during data out (Please refer to Figure 8.57 for 2 x I/O Double Transfer Rate Read Mode \nTiming Waveform).  \n \nIf AXh ( where X is don’t care ) is input for the mode bits during dummy cycles, the d evice will enter AX read \noperation mode which enables subsequent FRDDTR execution skips command code. It saves cycles as \ndescribed in Figure 8.58. When the code is different from AXh , the device exits the AX read operation. After \nfinishing the read operation, device becomes ready to receive a new command.  Since the number of dummy \ncycles and AX bit  cycles are same in this case, X should be Hi -Z to avoid I/O contention . \n \nIf the FRDDTR instruction is issued while a Program/Erase/Write Status Register c ycle is in progress (WIP=1), \nthe instruction will be rejected without any effect on the current cycle.  \n \n  \n                                                                                IS25LP064A/032A \n \nIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. - www.issi.com        73   \nRev.
