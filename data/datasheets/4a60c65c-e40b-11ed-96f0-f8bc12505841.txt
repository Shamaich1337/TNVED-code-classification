VIN supplies power for the internal MOSFET and regulator. The  NB679  \noperate s from a 5.5 V to 24 V input rail. An input capacitor  is needed to decouple the input \nrail. Use wide PCB traces and multiple vias to make the connection.  Apply at least two \nlayers for this i nput trace.  \n2 PGND  Power  ground.  Use wide PCB traces and enough vias to handle the load current  to make \nthe connection.  Make the PGND trace to the Vin decoupling  capacitor as wide as \npossible .  \n3 PG Power good output . The output of PG is an open -drain signal . It is high if the output \nvoltage is higher than 95 percent of the nominal voltage  or lower than 105 percent  of the \nnominal voltage.  \n4 NC No connection.  \n5 VOUT  VOUT is used to sense the output voltage of the buck regulator . Connect VOUT  to \nthe output capacitor of the regulato r directly. Also, VOUT  acts as the input of the internal \nLDO switch over power input. Keep the VOUT sensing trace far away from the SW node . \nAvoid vias on the VOUT sensing trace. A >25 mil trace is required.  \n6 LDO Internal LDO output.  Decouple with a minimum 4.7  µ F ceramic capacitor  as close to \nLDO as possible . X7R or X5R grade dielectric ceramic capacitors are recommended for \ntheir stable temperature characteristics. If ENLDO is high , it switch es over to the LDO to \nbuck after PG is ok.  \n7 SW Switch   output.  Connect SW to the inductor and bootstrap cap acitor. SW is driven up to \nthe VIN voltage by the high -side switch  during the on -time of the  PWM duty cycle.  The \ninductor current drives SW negative during the off -time. The on -resistance of the low -side \nswitch  and the internal diode fixes the negative voltage. Use wide  and short  PCB traces to \nmake the connection.  Try to minimize the area of the SW pattern.  \n8 BST Bootstrap . A capacitor connected between SW and BS  is required to form a floating \nsupply across the high -side switch driver.  \n9 VCC  Internal VCC LDO output . The driver and control circuits are powered from this voltage. \nDecouple with a minimum 1  µ F ceramic capacitor  as close to VCC  as possible . X7R or \nX5R grade dielectric ceramic capacitors are recommended for their stab le temperature \ncharacteristics.  \n10 AGND  Signal logic  ground.  Kelvin connection to PGND . \n11 EN Buck enable . EN is a digital input that turns the buck regulator on or off. When the power \nsupply of the control circuit is ready, drive EN high to tu rn on the buck regulator, and drive \nit low t o turn off the buck regulator . Connect EN to 3V3 through a pull -up resistor or a \nresistive voltage divider for automatic start -up. Do NOT float this pin. EN can be used to \nset USM . When EN is in the range of 1.4 V to 1.8 V, it enter s USM . If EN is in the range of \n2.6V to 3.6V, it operates in  normal mode.   \n12 ENLDO  LDO enable pin.  ENLDO is pulled up  internally  to high. Leave ENLDO open to enable the \nLDO.  Drive it low to turn off the LDO . \nNB679 — 28V VIN , FIXED 5 V-8A BUCK  CONVERTER  WITH LDO  \n \nNB679 Rev. 1.03 www.MonolithicPower.com  7 \n7/27/2017  MPS Proprietary Information.

All Rights Reserved.  \nOPERATION  \nPWM Operation  \nThe NB679  is a fully integrated , synchronous , \nrectified , step-down , switch -mode converter  with \na fixed 5 V output . Constant -on-time (COT) \ncontrol provide s fast transient response and \neases loop stabilization. At the beginning of each \ncycle, the high -side MOSFET (HS -FET) is turned \non when the feedback voltage (V FB) is below the \nreference vol tage (V REF), which indicates \ninsufficient output voltage. The on period is \ndetermined by the output voltage and the input \nvoltage to make the switching frequency fair ly \nconstant over the input voltage range.  \nAfter the on period elapses, the HS -FET is turned \noff or enters an off state. It is turned on again \nwhen V FB drops below V REF. By repeating \noperation this way, the converter regulates the \noutput voltage. The integrated low -side MOSFET \n(LS-FET) is turned on when the HS -FET is in its  \noff state to minimize the conduction loss. There is \na dead short between the input and GND if both \nthe HS-FET and the LS-FET are turned on at the \nsame time  (shoot -through ). In order to avoid \nshoot -through, a dead  time (DT) is generated \ninternally between the HS-FET off and the LS-\nFET on  period  or the LS-FET off and the HS-FET \non period .  \nInternal compensation is applied for COT control \nfor stable operation even when ceramic \ncapacitors are used as outpu t capacitors . This \ninternal compensation improve s the jitter \nperformance without affect ing the line or load \nregulation.  \nCCM Operation  \n \nFigure 2—CCM operation  \nContinuous conduction mode (CCM) occurs \nwhen the ou tput current is high , and the inductor current is always above zero amps  (see Figure 2) . \nWhen V FB is below V REF, the HS-FET is turned on \nfor a fixed interval.  When the HS -FET is turned \noff, the LS -FET is turned on until the next period.  \nIn CCM  operation, the switching frequency is \nfairly constant (PWM mode ).  \nDCM Operation  \nWhen the load decrease s, the inducto r current \nwill decrease  as well . Once the inductor current \nreaches  zero, the part transition s from CCM  to \ndiscontinuous  conduction  mode  (DCM).  \nDCM operation is shown in Figure 3. When V FB is \nbelow V REF, the HS-FET is turned on for a fixed \ninterval , which is determined by the one-shot on  \ntimer . See Equation (1). When the HS -FET is \nturned off, the LS -FET is turned on until the \ninductor current reaches zero. In DCM operation , \nVFB does not reach VREF when the inductor \ncurrent approach es zero. The LS -FET driver \nturns into tri -state (high Z) when  the inductor \ncurrent reaches zero. A current modulator takes \nover the control of the LS-FET and limits the \ninductor curr ent to less than -1 mA. Hence, the \noutput capacitors discharge slowly to GND \nthrough the LS-FET. As a result, the efficiency at \nlight-load is improved  greatly . The HS -FET is not \nturned on as frequently during a light -load \ncondition as it is during a heavy -load condition  \n(skip mode ). \nAt a light-load or no -load condition, the output \ndrops very slowly , and the NB679  reduce s the \nswitching frequency naturally , achiev ing high \nefficiency  at light load .  \n \nFigure 3—DCM operation  \n \nNB679 , 28 V VIN , FIXED 5V -8A BUCK  CONVERTER  WITH LDO  \n \nNB679 Rev. 1.03 www.MonolithicPower.com  12 \n7/27/2017  MPS Proprietary Information. Patent Protected . Unauthorized Photocopy and Duplic ation Prohibited.  \n © 2017  MPS. All Rights Reserved.  \nAs the output current increases from the light -\nload condition, the time period within which the \ncurrent modulator regulates becom es shorter. \nThe HS -FET is turned on more frequently. Hence , \nthe switching frequency increases accordingly . \nThe output current reaches the critical level when \nthe current modulator time is zero. The critical \nlevel of the output current is d etermined  with \nEquation (1) : \nIN OUT OUT\nOUT\nSW IN(V V ) VI2 L F V\uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4\n                                    (1) \nThe device enters PWM mode once the output \ncurrent exceeds the critical level. After that, the \nswitching frequency stays fairly constant ov er the \noutput current range.   \nDC Auto -Tune Loop  \nNB679 applies a DC auto -tune loop to balance \nthe DC error between V FB and V REF by adjusting \nthe comparator input  REF to make V FB always \nfollow V REF. The small  DC loop  improve s the load \nand line regulation without affecting  transient \nperformance. The relationship between V FB, VREF, \nand REF is shown in Figure.4  \nVFB\nREFVREF DC \nError\n \nFigure 4—DC auto -tune loop operation  \nLarge Duty O peration   \nThe NB679 supports larger duty operation (5.5 V-\n5 V) by its internal Ton extension function . When \nthe parts detects its FB is lower than Vref  and   \nVin - Vo < 2 V, the Ton can be  extended , \nextending  the duty . If FB > REF or Ton reaches  \nits limitation, Ton  will stop extend ing. \nLight load Ultra sonic Mode  \nUltrasonic mode (USM) keep s the switching \nfrequency above an audible frequency area \nduring light-load or no -load conditions. Once the \npart detect s both the HS -FET and the LS-FET \nare off (for about 30 µs), it shrink s the Ton so as \nto keep Vout under regulation with optimal \nefficiency . If the load continues to  reduc e, the \npart disch arges the Vout  to make sure FB is \nsmaller than 102  percent  of the internal \nreference . The HS -FET turns on again once the \ninternal FB reach es VREF  and then stops \nswitching.  USM is selected by the EN voltage level . When \nEN is in the range of 1.4 V to 1.8 V, it enter s \nUSM . If EN is in  the range of 2.6 V to 3.6 V, it \noperates in  normal mode.   \nConfiguring the EN Control  \nThe NB679  has two enable pins to control the \non/off of the internal regulat ors and  LDO.  \nFor NB679, the buck regulator  and LDO are \ncontrolled by EN and ENLDO , respectively . For \nexample, when the application  is only used  with \nthe buck  regulator , the buck regulator  is realized \nby pull ing ENLDO low, allowin g the buck  to be \ncontrolled by EN.  \nSee Table  2 for the NB679 EN logics . \nTable 2—ENLDO/EN control  \nState  ENLDO  EN VCC  VOUT  5V LDO  \nS0 1 1 ON ON ON \nS3 1 0 ON OFF ON \nS5 0 0 OFF OFF OFF \nOthers  0 1 ON ON OFF \nFor automatic start -up, EN can be pulled up to \nthe input voltage through a resistive voltage \ndivider.  Refer to the “ UVLO Protection ” section  \nfor more details . \nSoft Start  (SS) \nThe NB679  employs a soft-start (SS) mechanism \nto ensure smooth output during power -up. When \nEN becomes high, the internal reference voltage \nramps up gradually; this causes  the output \nvoltage to ramp  up smoothly  as well. Once the \nreference voltage reaches the target value, the \nsoft start finishes , and the part  enters steady - \nstate operation.  \nIf the output is pre -biased to a certain voltage \nduring start -up, the IC disable s the switching of \nboth the high-side and low -side switches until the \nvoltage on the internal reference exceeds the \nsensed output voltage at the internal FB no de. \nNB679 , 28 V VIN , FIXED 5V -8A BUCK  CONVERTER  WITH LDO  \n \nNB679 Rev. 1.03 www.MonolithicPower.com  13 \n7/27/2017  MPS Proprietary Information.

All Rights Reserved.  \n5 V Linear Regulator  \nThere is a built -in 100 mA standby linear \nregulator w ith a fixed output  at 5 V, controlled by \nENLDO . The 5 V LDO is intended mainly for an \nauxiliary 5 V supply for the notebook system \nduring standby mode.  \nAdd a ceramic ca pacitor with a value between \n4.7 μF and 22  µF placed close to the LDO pins to \nstabilize the LDOs.  \nLDO Switch Over  \nWhen the output voltage becomes higher than \n4.8 V (and the power good is ok), the internal \nLDO is switched over to VOUT  by the internal \nMOSFET . This helps reduce the power loss from \nthe LDO.  \nPower Good (PG)  \nThe NB679  has power  good (PG) output  used to \nindicate whether the output voltage of the buck \nregulator is ready . PG is the open drain o f a \nMOSFET. It should be connected to V CC or \nanother voltage source through a resistor (e.g. \n100 k). After the input voltage is applied, the \nMOSFET is turned on so that  PG is pulled to \nGND before SS is ready. After the FB voltage \nreaches 9 5 percent  of the REF voltage, PG is \npulled high after 750 µs. When the FB voltage \ndrops to 85 percent  of the REF voltage, PG is \npulled low.  \nOver -Current Protection  (OCP)  \nNB679  has cycle -by-cycle over -current limiting \ncontrol. The curre nt-limit circuit employs a \n"valley" current -sensing algorithm. The  part uses  \nthe Rds(on) of the LS-FET as a current -sensing \nelement. If the magnitude of the current -sense \nsignal is above the current -limit threshold, the \nPWM is not allowed to  initiate a new cycle.  \nThe trip level is fixed internally . The inductor \ncurrent is monitored by the voltage between GND \nand SW . GND is used as the positive current \nsensing node , so GND should be connected to \nthe source terminal  of the bottom MOSFET.  \nSince the comparison is done during the HS-FET \noff and LS-FET on state, the OC trip level  sets \nthe valley level of the inductor current. Thus, the \nload current at the over-current threshold  (IOC) \ncan be calculated with Equation (2) : \n\uf044\uf03d\uf02binductor\nOCII I_limit2                                  (2) \nIn an over -current condition, the current to the \nload exceeds the current to the output capacitor; \nthus, the output voltage tends to fall off. \nEven tually, it ends up crossing the under -voltage \nprotection threshold and shut s down . Fault \nlatching can be re -set by EN going low or the \npower cycling of VIN.  \nOver/Under -Voltage Protection (OVP/UVP)  \nNB679 monitor s the output voltage to det ect over \nand under voltage.  Once the feedbac k voltage \nbecomes higher than 12 2 percent  of the target  \nvoltage, the OVP comparator output goes high , \nand the circuit latches as the HS-FET driver turns \noff, and the LS-FET dr iver turns on, acting as an \n-1.8 A current source . \nWhen the feedback voltage drops below  75 \npercent  of the Vref but remains higher than 50  \npercent , the UVP -1 comparator output goes high . \nThe part is latch ed if the FB volta ge remains  in \nthis range  for about 32 µs (latching the HS-FET \noff and the LS-FET on). The LS -FET remains  on \nuntil the inductor current hits zero. During this \nperiod, the valley current limit helps control the \ninductor curr ent.  \nWhen the feedback voltage drops below 50 \npercent  of the Vref, the UVP -2 comparator output \ngoes high , and the part is latch ed off directly after \nthe comparator and logic dela y (latch ing the  HS-\nFET off and the LS-FET on). The LS -FET \nremains  on until the inductor current hits zero. \nFault latching can be re -set by EN going low or \nthe p ower cycling of VIN.   \nUVLO Protection  \nThe part starts up only w hen the Vin voltage is \nhigher than the UVLO rising th reshold voltage . \nThe part shuts down  when  VIN is lower than the \nVin falling threshold. The UVLO protection is \nnon-latch off.  Fault latching can be re -set by EN \ngoing low or the p ower -cycling of VIN . \n \nIf an application requires a higher under -voltage \nlockout (UVLO), use EN (see Figure 5 ) to adjust \nthe input voltage UVLO by using two external \nresistors. It is recommended to use the enable \nresistors to set the Vin falling threshold above 5.5 \nV.

All Rights Reserved.  \nAPPLICATION INFORMAT ION  \nInput Capacitor    \nThe input current to the step -down converter is \ndiscontinuous , and therefore requires a capacitor \nto supply the AC current to the step -down \nconverter while maintaining the DC i nput voltage. \nCeramic capacitors are recommended for best \nperformance and should be placed as close to \nthe V IN pin as possible. Capacitors with X5R and \nX7R ceramic dielectrics are recommended \nbecause they are fairly stable with temperature \nfluctuations.  \nThe capacitors must have a ripple -current rating \ngreater than the maximum input ripple current of \nthe converter. The input ripple current can be \nestimated with Equation (3)  and Equation (4) : \nOUT OUT\nCIN OUT\nIN INVVI I (1 )VV\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d\n                              (3) \nThe worst -case condition occurs at V IN = 2V OUT, \nwhere:  \nOUT\nCINII2\uf03d\n                                                          (4) \nFor simplification, choose the input capacitor with \nan RMS current rating greater than half of the \nmaximum lo ad current.  \nThe input capacit or value determines the input \nvoltage ripple of the converter. If there is an input \nvoltage ripple requirement in the system, choose \nan input capacitor that meets the specification.  \nThe input voltage ripple can be estima ted using \nEquation (5) and Equation (6) : \nOUT OUT OUT\nIN\nSW IN IN INI V VV (1 )F C V V\uf044 \uf03d \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0b4\n                 (5) \nThe worst -case condition  occurs  at VIN = 2V OUT, \nwhere:  \nOUT\nIN\nSW INI 1V4 F C\uf044 \uf03d \uf0b4\uf0b4\n                                         (6) \nOutput Capacitor  \nAn output capacitor is required to maintain the \nDC output voltage. Ceramic or POSCAP \ncapacitors are recommended. The output voltage \nripple can be estimated using Equation (7) : \nOUT OUT\nOUT ESR\nSW IN SW OUTVV 1V (1 ) (R )F L V 8 F C\uf044 \uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02d \uf0b4 \uf02b\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4  (7) \nWhen using ceramic capacitors, the impedance \nat the switching frequency is dominated by the \ncapacitance. The output voltage ripple is  caused  \nmainly  by the capacitance. For simplification, the \noutput voltage ripple can be estimated using \nEquation (8) : \nOUT OUT\nOUT 2\nSW OUT INVVV (1 )8 F L C V\uf044 \uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4\n                       (8) \nWhen using POSCAP capacitors, the ESR \ndominates the impedance at the switching \nfrequency . The output ripple can be \napproximated with Equation (9) : \n  \nOUT OUT\nOUT ESR\nSW INVVV (1 ) RF L V\uf044 \uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02d \uf0b4\uf0b4                (9) \nThe m aximum output capaci tor limitation should \nbe considered in design application. For a small \nsoft-start time period  (if the output capacitor \nvalue is too high ), the output voltage ca nnot \nreach the design value during the soft -start time,  \ncausing  it to fail to regulate. The maximum output \ncapacitor value (Co_max) can be limited \napproximately using Equation (10) : \nO _MAX LIM_ AVG OUT ss OUTC (I I ) T / V\uf03d \uf02d \uf0b4\n              (10) \nWhere, I LIM_AVG  is the average start -up current \nduring a soft-start period  (it can be equivale nt to \nthe current limit value ), and Tss is the soft -start \ntime.  \nInductor  \nThe inductor is necessary to supply constant \ncurrent to the output load while being driven by \nthe switched input voltage. A larger  value \ninductor result s in less ripple curre nt, resulting  in \na lower output ripple voltage. However, a larger  \nvalue inductor has a larger physical footprint, a \nhigher series resistance, and/or a lower \nsaturation current. A good rule for determining \nthe inductance value is to design the peak -to-\npeak ripple current in the inductor to be in the \nrange of 30  percent  to 50  percent  of the \nmaximum output current, with the peak inductor \ncurrent below the maximum switch current limit. \nNB679 , 28 V VIN , FIXED 5V -8A BUCK  CONVERTER  WITH LDO  \n \nNB679 Rev. 1.03 www.MonolithicPower.com  16 \n7/27/2017  MPS Proprietary Information.

For best results, refer to Figure 6 \nand follow the guidelines below . For more \ninformation, refer to  AN087 .  \n1. Place t he high -current paths (GND, IN, and \nSW) very close  to the device with short, direct , \nand wide traces.  The PGND trace should be as wide as possible (This should be the \nnumber one priority ). \n2. Place the input capacitors as close to IN and \nGND  as possible  on the same layer as the  IC. \n3. Place the decoupling capacitor as close to \nVCC and GND  as possible. Keep the \nswitching node (SW) short and away f rom the \nfeedback network.  \n4. Keep the BST voltage path as short as \npossible with >50  mil trace.   \n5. Keep the IN and GND pads connected with a \nlarge copper  plane to achieve better thermal \nperformance.
