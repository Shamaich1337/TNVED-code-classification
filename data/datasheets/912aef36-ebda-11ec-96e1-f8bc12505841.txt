The HFBR-0500ETZ series includes trans-\nmitters, receivers, connec  tors and cable specified for  \neasy design. This series of compo nents is ideal for  \nsolving problems with voltage isolation/insula  tion,  \nEMI/RFI immunity or data security. The optical link  \ndesign is simpli fied by the logic compat ible receivers \nand complete specifi-cations for each component. The \nkey optical and electrical parameters of links configured \nwith the HFBR-0500ETZ family are fully guaranteed from \n-40° to 85° C.\nA wide variety of package config u ra tions and connectors \nprovide the designer with numerous mechanical solutions \nto meet application requirements. The transmitter and \nreceiver compo nents have been designed for use in high \nvolume/low cost assembly processes such as auto inser -\ntion and wave soldering.\nTransmitters incorporate a 660 nm LED. Receivers  \ninclude a monolithic dc coupled, digital IC receiver  \nwith open collector Schottky output transistor. An  \ninternal pullup resistor is avail able for use in the  \nHFBR-25X1ETZ and HFBR-25X2ETZ receivers. A shield has \nbeen integrated into the receiver IC to provide additional,  \nlocalized noise immunity.\nInternal optics have been optim ized for use with 1 mm \ndiameter plastic optical fiber. Versatile Link specifications \nincorporate all connector interface losses. Therefore, \noptical calculations for common link applications are \nsimplified.\n\n2Available option – Horizontal Package \nHFBR-x521ETZ HFBR-x522ETZ\nAvailable option – Vertical Package \nHFBR-x531ETZ HFBR-x532ETZ\nAvailable option – 30° Tilted Package \nHFBR-x541ETZ HFBR-x542ETZ\nLink Selection Guide\n(Links specified from -40° to 85° C, for plastic optical fiber unless specified.)\nSignal Rate Distance (m) 25° C Distance (m) Transmitter Receiver\n1 MBd 67 43 HFBR-15x2ETZ HFBR-25x2ETZ\n5 Mbd 38 20 HFBR-15x1ETZ HFBR-25x1ETZHFBR-0500ETZ Series Part Number Guide\n       HFBR-X5XXETZ\n \n 1 = Transmitter \n 2 = Receiver ET = extended temperature range \n  Z = RoHS compliant     \n \n 5 = 660 nm Transmitter and \n   Receiver Products \n  1 = 5 MBd High Performance Link\n  2 = 1 MBd High Performance Link\n 2 = Horizontal Package 6 = 155 MBd Receiver\n 3 = Vertical Package 7 = 155 MBd Transmitter\n 4 = 30° Tilted Package\n3VALOX\uf8e8 is a registered trademark of the General Electric Corporation.Application Literature\nApplication Note 1035 (Versatile Link)\nPackage and Handling Information\nThe compact Versatile Link pack  age is made of a flame \nretardant VALOX® UL 94 V-0 material (UL file # E121562) \nand uses the same pad layout as a standard, eight pin \ndual-in-line package. Vertical and horizontal mountable \nparts are available. These low profile Versa  tile Link pack -\nages are stackable and are enclosed to provide a dust \nresistant seal. Snap action simplex, simplex latching, \nduplex, and duplex latching connectors are offered with \nsimplex or duplex cables.\nPackage Orientation\nPerformance and pinouts for the vertical and hori-\nzontal packages are identical. To provide addi tional  \nattachment support for the vertical Versatile Link  \nhousing, the designer has the option of using a self-\ntapping screw through a printed circuit board into a \nmounting hole at the bottom of the package. For most \napplications this is not necessary.\nPackage Housing Color\nVersatile Link components and simplex connectors are \ncolor coded to eliminate confusion when making connec -\ntions. Receivers are blue and transmit ters are gray.Handling\nVersatile Link components are auto-insertable. When  \nwave soldering is performed with Versatile Link compo -\nnents, the optical port plug should be left in to prevent \ncontamination of the port. Do not use reflow solder \nprocesses (i.e., infrared reflow or vapor-phase reflow). \nNonhalogenated water soluble fluxes (i.e., 0% chloride), \nnot rosin based fluxes, are recom mended for use with \nVersatile Link components.\nVersatile Link components are moisture sensitive \ndevices and are shipped in a moisture sealed bag. If the \ncomponents are exposed to air for an extended period of \ntime, they may require a baking step before the solder -\ning process. Refer to the special labeling on the shipping \ntube for details.\nRecommended Chemicals for Cleaning/Degreasing\nAlcohols: methyl, isopropyl, isobutyl. Aliphatics: hexane, \nheptane. Other: soap solution, naphtha.\nDo not use partially halogenated hydrocarbons such \nas 1,1.1 trichloroethane, ketones such as MEK, acetone, \nchloroform, ethyl acetate, methylene dichloride, phenol, \nmethylene chloride, or N-methylpyrolldone. Also, Avago \ndoes not recommend the use of cleaners that use  \nhalogenated hydrocarbons because of their potential \nenvironmental harm.\n4Mechanical Dimensions\nHorizontal Modules Vertical Modules\n30° Tilted Modules\nA\nA\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]\n6.5[0.26]\n2[0.08]10.2[0.40]\n18.7\n[0.74]6.6[0.26]\n15.2[0.60]\n7.62\n[0.300]2.54\n[0.100]0.5\n[0.02]1.3\n[0.05]\n4.6[0.18]\n0.6[0.03]\n10.1\n[0.40]8.7\n[0.34]\n19.3\n[0.76]1.1\n[0.05]\n2.2\n[0.09]\n4.6[0.18]0.4\n[0.02]30°\n0.7\n[0.03]2\n[0.08]18.9[0.75]3.3 [0.13] M\nAX2.8 [0.11] M\nIN\n0.5\n[0.02]2.54\n[0.100]1.3\n[0.05]7.6\n[0.30]\n1.7\n[0.07]\n0.6\n[0.02]\n3.8\n[0.15]\n3.8[0.15]7.62\n[0.300]\n2)\n 18.1\n[0.71]\n5.1[0.20]10.2[0.40]1\n[0.04]3.6\n[0.14]\n∅0.6\n[∅0.03]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]\n2) Optional mounting hole for #2 self-tapping-screw\n    (metric equivalent M2.2 x 0.45)6.5\n[0.26]\n2[0.08]6.5[0.26]0.6[0.03]\n7.7\n[0.30]\n7.6[0.30]18.8\n[0.74]\n2.8\n[0.11]\n 3.8[0.15]M\nAX.3.6[0.14]M\nIN.5.1\n[0.20]4.2[0.17]\n1.3\n[0.05]\n2.54\n[0.100]\n1.7\n[0.07]0.5\n[0.02]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]∅0.6\n[∅0.03]\n10.2[0.40]\n5Versatile Link Printed Board Layout Dimensions\nHorizontal Module Vertical Module\n30° Tilted Modules7.62\n[0.300]\n2.54\n[0.100]7.7[0.30]\n1.9\n[0.07]PCB EDGE\nMIN.1 2 3 4\n8 5\nFootprint - TOP VIEW1\n[  ∅ 0.04]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]∅7.62[0.300]3.8\n[0.15]\n3.8\n[0.15]7.62\n[0.300]\n2.54\n[0.100]\n2.25 [0.09] clearance hole \nfor optional vertical mount\nself-tapping-screw #2\nPCB EDGE\n1.7\n[0.07]MIN.1 2 3 4\n5 8\nFootprint - TOP VIEW∅1[0.04]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]∅\n2.54\n[0.100]7.62\n[0.300]8.7[0.34]\nPCB EDGE4 3 2 1\n8 5\nFootprint - TOP VIEW2.2\n[0.09]MIN.1[0.04]\nNOTES:\n1) Dimensions: mm [in]∅\n∅\n6Interlocked (Stacked) Assemblies (refer to Figure 1)\nHorizontal packages may be stacked by placing units \nwith pins facing upward.

Use \na straight edge, such as a ruler, to bring all stacked \nunits into uniform alignment. This tech nique prevents  \npotential harm that could occur to fingers and hands of \nassemblers from the package pins. Stacked horizontal packages can be disengaged if necessary. Repeated \nstacking and unstack  ing causes no damage to individual \nunits.\nTo stack vertical packages, hold one unit in each hand, \nwith the pins facing away and the optical ports on the \nbottom. Slide the L bracket unit into the L slot unit. The \nstraight edge used for horizontal package alignment is \nnot needed.\nStacking Horizontal Modules\nFigure 1.
