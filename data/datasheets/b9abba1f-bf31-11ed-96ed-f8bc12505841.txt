No vias should be used between decoupling capacitor and VDD pin. The PCB trace to VDD pin should be kept as short as possible, as should the PCB trace to the ground via. Distance of the ferrite bead and bulk decoupling from the device is less critical.\n2)\nAn op\ntimum layout is one with all components on th e\nsam\ne side of the board, minimizing vias through other sign al\nla\nyers (the ferrite bead and bulk decoupling capacitor can be \nmounted on the back). Other signal traces should be rout ed\na\nway from the ICS557-05A.\nThis includes signal traces just underneath the device, or on \nlayers adjacent to the ground plane layer used by the device.\nExternal Components\nA minimum number of external components are required for \nproper operation. Decoupling capacitors of 0.01  μF should \nbe connected between VDD and GND pairs (1,9 and 15,16) \nas close to the device as possible. \nOn chip capacitors - Crystal capacitors should be \nconnected from pins X1 to ground and X2 to ground to \noptimize the initial accuracy. The value (in pf) of these crystal caps equal (C\nL-12)*2 in this equation, CL=crystal \nload capacitance in pf. For example, for a crystal with a 16 pF load cap, each external crystal cap would be 8 pF . [(16-12)x2]=8. \nCurrent Reference Source Rr (Iref)\nIf board target trace impedance (Z) is 50 Ω, then Rr = 475 Ω \n(1%), providing IREF of 2.32 mA, output current (IOH) is \nequal to 6*IREF .Load Resistors RL\nSince the clock outputs are open source outputs, 50 ohm external resistors to ground are to be connected at each clock output.\nOutput Termination\nThe PCI-Express differential clock outputs of the ICS557-05A are open source drivers and require an external series resistor and a resistor to ground. These resistor values and their allowable locations are shown in detail in the PCI-Express Layout Guidelines  section.\nThe ICS557-05A can also be configured for LVDS compatible voltage levels. See the LVDS Compatible Layout Guidelines  section.\n\nICS557-05A\nQUAD DIFFERENTIAL PCI-EXPRESS GEN1 CLOCK SOURCE PCIE SSCG\nIDT®  QUAD DIFFERENTIAL PCI-EXPRESS GEN1 CLOCK SOURCE 5 ICS557-05A REV O  112111Output Structures\nGeneral PCB Layout Recommendations\nFor optimum device performance and lowest output phase \nnoise, the following guide lines should be observed.\n1.
