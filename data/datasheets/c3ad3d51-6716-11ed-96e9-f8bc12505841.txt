At approximately 150 \uf0b0C, which is \nthe glass transition temperature, the plastic changes its \nproperties. Even temporarily exceeding this temperature limit \nmay change the stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric performance of the amplifiers. Exceeding a junction temperature of 150°C for an extended period can result in changes in silicon devices, potentially causing degradation or loss of functionality.  \nThe power dissipated in the package (P\nD) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the die \ndue to the amplifier’s drive at the output. The quiescent power is \nthe voltage between the supply pins (V S) times the quiescent \ncurrent (I S). \n PD = Quiescent Power  + (Total Drive Power  − Load Power ) \n\uf028\uf029\nLOUT\nLOUT S\nS S DRV\nRV VI V P2\n2\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\uf0e6\uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf03d  \nRMS output voltages should be considered. If R L is referenced  \nto −V S, as in single-supply operation, the total drive power is  \nVS × I OUT. If the rms signal levels are indeterminate, consider the \nworst case, when V OUT = V S/4 for R L to midsupply. \n\uf028\uf029\uf028\uf029\nLS\nS S DRVI V P24 /\uf02b \uf0b4 \uf03d  \nIn single-supply operation with R L referenced to −V S, worst case \nis V OUT = V S/2. \nAirflow increases heat dissipation, effectively reducing θ JA.  \nIn addition, more metal directly in contact with the package \nleads and through holes under the device reduces θ JA. \nFigure 5 shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage vs. the ambient temperature for the 8-lead SOIC_N \n(125°C/W), the 6-lead SOT-23 (170°C/W), 8-lead MSOP \n(145°C/W), and 8-lead LFCSP_WD (103°C/W) on a JEDEC \nstandard 4-layer board. θ JA values are approximations. \n2.0\n0\n–55 125\n05614-061\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n–45 –35 –25 –15 –5 5 15 25 35 45 55 65 75 85 95 105 115SOT-23SOIC\nMSOPLFCSP\n \nFigure 5.

The ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 are fabricated \non A DI’s second generation XFCB process and feature trimmed \nsupply current and offset voltage . The 2 .1 nV/√Hz voltage noise \n(very low for a 1. 1 mA supply current amplifier), 4 0 µV offset \nvoltage , and sub 1  µV/°C offset drift is accomplished with an \ninput stage m ade of an und egenerated  PNP input pair driving a \nsymmetrical folded cascode . A rail -to-rail output stage provides \nthe maximum linear signal range possible on low voltage \nsupplies and has the current drive capability needed for the \nrelatively low resistance  feedback networks required for low \nnoise operation . CMRR, PSRR, and open -loop gain are all \ntypically  above 100 dB, preserving the precision performance in \na variety of configurations. Gain  bandwidth is kept high for this \npower level to preserve the outsta nding linearity performance \nfor frequencies up to 100 kHz. The ADA4841- 1 has a power -\ndown  function to further reduce power consumption . All this \nresults in a low noise, power efficie nt, precision amplifier that is \nwell-suited for high resolution and precision applications.  \nDC ERRORS  \nFigure 39 shows a typical connection diagram and the major dc  \nerror sources .

The input stage positive limit is almost exactly a volt below the \npositive supply at room temperatur e. Input voltages above that \nstart to show clipping behavior . The positive input voltage limit \nincreases with temperature with a coefficient of about 2  mV/ °C. \nThe lower supply limit is nominally below the minus supply ; \ntherefore, in a standard gain configu ration, the output stage \nlimits the signal headroom on the negative supply side . Figure 42 \nand Figure 43 show  the nominal CMRR behavior at the  limits of \nthe input headroom for three temperatures —this is generated \nusing the subtractor topology shown in Figure 44, which avoids \nthe output stage limitation.  \n300\n–300\n3.00 5.00\n05614-055\nCOMMON-MODEVOLTAGE(V)COMMON-MODE ERROR ( µV)260\n220\n180\n140\n100\n60\n20\n–20\n–60\n–100\n–140\n–180\n–220\n–260\n3.203.403.603.804.004.204.404.604.80–40°C+25°C+125°C\n \nFigure 42. +CMV vs. Common -Mode Error vs. VOS \n0\n–800\n–6.00 –4.00\n05614-054\nCOMMON-MODE VOLTAGE (V)COMMON-MODE ERROR (µV)–50\n–100\n–150\n–200\n–250\n–300–350\n–400–450\n–500\n–550–600–650–700\n–750\n–5.80 –5.60 –5.40 –5.20 –5.00 –4.80 –4.60 –4.40 –4.20–40°C\n+25°C\n+125°C\n \nFigure 43. −CMV v s.

Small Signal Frequency Response vs. Negative Supply Bias  \nThe input voltage (V IN) and reference voltage (V IP) are both at \n0 V,  (see Figure 39). +VS is biased at +5  V, and −VS is swep t \nfrom −200 mV to − 20 mV . With the input and output voltages \nbiased 200 mV above  the bottom rail, the G  = −1 inverter \nfrequency response is not much different from  what is seen \nwith the input and output voltages biased near midsupply.  At 150 mV bias, the frequency response starts to decrease  \nand at 20  mV , the inverter bandwidth is less than half its \nnominal value.  \nCAPACITANCE DRIVE  \nCapacitance at the output of an amplifier creates a delay within \nthe feedback path that, if within the bandwidth of the loop , can \ncreate excessive ringing and oscillation . The G  = +1 follower \ntopology has the highest loop bandwidth of any typical \nconfiguration and , therefore , is the most vulnerable to the  \neffects of capacitance load .  \nA small resistor in series with the amplifi er output and the \ncapacitive load mitigates the problem .

Figure 50 \nshows a typical 16 -bit single -supply application.  \nThere are different challenges to a single- supply , high resolution \ndesign, and the ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 address th ese nicely. \nIn a single -supply system, a main challenge is using the \namplifier in buffer mode with the lowest output noise and \npreserving linearity compatible with the ADC.  \nRail-to-rail input amplifiers are usually higher noise than the \nADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 and can not be used in this mode \nbecause of the non linear region around the crossover point of \ntheir  input stage s. The ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 , which ha ve no \ncrossover region but ha ve a wide linear input range from 100 mV \nbelow ground to 1  V below positive rail , solve this problem , as \nshown in Figure 50. The amplifier, when configured as a \nfollower, has a linear signal range from 0 .25 V above the minus \nsupply vo ltage (limited by the amplifier’ s output stage) to 1 V  \nbelow the positive s upply (limited by t he amplifier  input stage). \nA 0 V to + 4.096 V signal range can be accommodated with a \npositive supply as low as + 5.2 V and a negative power supply of \n−0.25 V . The 5.2  V supply also allows the use of a small, low \ndropout, low temperature drift ADR364 reference voltage. If \nground is used as the amplifier  negative supply, then note that at \nthe low end of the input range close to ground, the ADA4841- 1/ \nADA4841- 2 exhibit substantial nonlinearity, as any rail -to-rail \noutput amplifier. The ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 drive a one -\npole, low -pass filter. This filter limits the already very low noise \ncontribution from the amplifier to the AD7685. RECONSTRUCTION FILTER  \nThe ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 can also be used as a reconstruction \nfilter at the output of DACs for suppression of the sampling \nfrequency. The filter shown in Figure 49 is a two -pole , 500 kHz \nSallen -Key LPF with a fixed gain of G = + 1.6.  \nU1C2\n1320pF\nR3\n840WINPUT+5V 10µF\n0.1µF\n–5V10µF0.1µFOUTPUT\n05614-044C1\n1320pFR2\n249WR1\n249W\nR4\n499W\n \nFigure 49.

Filter Frequency Response \nLAYOUT CONSIDERATION S \nTo ensure optimal performance , careful and deliberate attention \nmust be paid to the board  layout, signal routing, power supply \nbypassing, and grounding.  \nGROUND PLANE  \nIt is important to avoid ground in the are as under  and around  \nthe input and output of the ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 . Stray \ncapacitance created between the ground plane and the input \nand output pads of a device are detrimental to high speed amplifier performance. S tray capacitance at the inverting input , \nalong with the amplifier input capacitance , lowers the phase \nmargin and can cause instability. Stray capac itance at the output \ncreates a pole in the feedback loop. This can reduce phase \nmargin and c an cause the circuit to become unstable.   POWER SUPPLY BYPASSI NG \nPower supply bypassing is a critical aspect in the performance of the ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2. A parallel connection of \ncapacitors from each of the power su pply pin s to ground works \nbest. A typical connection i s shown in Figure 49. Smaller value \ncapacitors offer better high frequency res ponse where larger \nvalue electrolytic s offer better low frequency performance. \nParalleling different values and sizes of capacitors helps to \nensure that the power su pply pins are provided a low ac impedance  \nacross a wide band of frequencies. This is important for minimizing \nthe coupling of noise into the ampl ifier. This can be e specially \nimportant when the amplifier PSR is starting to roll off —the \nbypass capacitors can  help lessen the degradation in  PSR \nperformance.  \nStart ing directly at the ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 power s upply \npins, the smallest value c apacitor  should be placed on the same \nside of the board as the amplifier, and as close as possible to the  \namplifier  power supply pin. The ground end of the capacitor \nshould  be connected directly to the ground plan e. Keeping the \ncapacitors ’ distance short but equal from the load is important \nand can improve distortion performance. This pro cess should \nbe repeated for the next largest  value capacitor.  \nIt is re commended that a 0.1 µF ceramic 0508 case be used. The \n0508 case size offers low series inductance and excellent high \nfrequency performance. A 10 µF electrolytic capaci tor should be \nplaced in parallel with the 0.1 µF  capacitor . Depending on the \ncircuit parameters, some enhancement to performance can be realized b y adding additional capacitors. Each circuit is different  \nand should be individually analyzed for optimal performance.  \n \nData Sheet  ADA4841- 1/ADA4841- 2 \n \nRev.
