The LT8650 S \nfeatures the second generation Silent Switcher architecture \nto minimize EMI emissions while delivering high efficiency \nat high switching frequencies. This includes integration of \nbypass capacitors to optimize high frequency current loops \nand make it easy to achieve advertised EMI performance \nby eliminating layout sensitivity.\nThe fast, clean, low overshoot, switching edges enable \nhigh efficiency operation even at high switching frequen -\ncies, leading to a small overall solution size. Peak current \nmode control with a 40ns  minimum on-time allows high \nstep down ratios at high switching frequencies.\nBurst Mode operation features a 6.2μA  quiescent current \nresulting in high efficiency at low output currents, forced \ncontinuous mode allows fixed switching frequency opera -\ntion over the entire output load range, and spread spectrum \noperation can further reduce EMI emissions. External VC \npins allow optimal loop compensation for fast transient \nresponse. The VC pins can also be used for current sharing \nand the CLKOUT pin enables synchronizing two LT8650 S \nchips to generate a 4-phase, 16A supply. \nTYPICAL APPLICATION  FEATURES DESCRIPTIONDual Channel 4A, 42V, \nSynchronous Step-Down Silent Switcher 2\nwith 6.2µA  Quiescent Current\n5V/4A, 3.3V/4A 2MHz  Step-Down Converter EfficiencyAPPLICATIONS nSilent Switcher®2 Architecture :\n nUltralow EMI on Any PCB\n nEliminates PCB Layout Sensitivity\n nInternal Bypass Capacitors Reduce Radiated EMI\n nOptional Spread Spectrum Modulation\n n4A DC from Each Channel Simultaneously\n nUp to 6A on Either Channel\n nUltralow Quiescent Current Burst Mode® Operation :\n n6.2μA  IQ Regulating 12V IN to 5V OUT1 and 3.3V OUT2\n nOutput Ripple <10mV P-P\n nOptional External VC Pin : Fast T ransient Response \nand Current Sharing (Extra 50µA  IQ/Channel)\n nForced Continuous Mode\n nHigh Efficiency at High Frequency\n n94.6% Efficiency at 2A, 5VOUT from 12V IN at 2MHz\n n93.3% Efficiency at 4A, 5VOUT from 12V IN at 2MHz\n nFast Minimum Switch On-Time : 40ns\n nWide Input Voltage Range : 3.0V to 42V\n nAdjustable and Synchronizable : 300kHz  to 3MHz\n nSmall 4mm  × 6mm  32-Pin LQFN Package\n nAEC- Q100  Qualified for Automotive Applications\n nGeneral Purpose Step-Down\n nAutomotive and Industrial SuppliesAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Specifications over the –40°C \nto 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, \ncharacterization, and correlation with statistical process controls. The \nLT8650 SI is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction \ntemperature range. High junction temperatures degrade operating \nlifetimes. The LT8650 SJ is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 150°C operating junction temperature range. Operating lifetime is derated at \njunction temperatures greater than 125°C. The junction temperature (T J, \nin °C) is calculated from the ambient temperature (T A in °C) and power \ndissipation (P D, in Watts) according to the formula : \n TJ = TA + (P D • θJA) where θJA (in °C/W) is the package thermal  \n impedance.\nNote 3 : This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended to \nprotect  the device during overload conditions.

C For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS\nRT (Pin 1) : A resistor is tied between RT and ground to \nset the switching frequency.\nVIN1 (Pin 4, 5) : The V IN1 pin supplies current to the LT8650 S \ninternal circuitry and to the internal top side power switch \nof channel 1. This pin must be locally bypassed. Be sure to \nplace the positive terminal of the input capacitor as close \nas possible to the V IN1 pin, and the negative capacitor \nterminal as close as possible to the GND pins. V IN1 must \nbe 3V or higher for LT8650 S to operate.\nVIN2 (Pin 7, 8) : The V IN2 pin supplies current to the internal \ntop side power switch of channel 2. This pin must be lo -\ncally bypassed. Be sure to place the positive terminal of \nthe input capacitor as close as possible to the V IN2 pin, \nand the negative capacitor terminal as close as possible \nto the GND pins. This input is capable of operating from \na different supply than V IN1. VIN1 must be present to run \nchannel 2.\nEN/U V1 (Pin 11) : Channel 1 of the LT8650 S is shut down \nwhen this pin is low and active when this pin is high. The \nhysteretic threshold voltage is 0.77V  going up and 0.74V  \ngoing down. Tie to V IN1 if the shutdown feature is not \nused. An external resistor divider from V IN1 can be used \nto program a V IN threshold below which channel 1 of the \nLT8650 S will shut down. Do not float this pin.\nEN/U V2 (Pin 12) : Channel 2 of the LT8650 S is shut down \nwhen this pin is low and active when this pin is high. The \nhysteretic threshold voltage is 0.77V  going up and 0.74V  \ngoing down. Tie to V IN2 if shutdown feature is not used. An \nexternal resistor divider from V IN2 can be used to program \na VIN threshold below which channel 2 of the LT8650 S \nwill shut down. Do not float this pin.\nTEMP (Pin 13) : Temperature Output Pin. This pin outputs \na voltage proportional to junction temperature. The pin is \n250mV  for 25°C and has a slope of 9.5mV /°C. The output \nof this pin is not valid during light output loads on both \nchannels while in Burst Mode operation. Put the LT8650 S \nin forced continuous mode for the TEMP output to be valid \nacross the entire output load range. See the Applications \nInformation  section for more information.\nPG1 (Pin 14) : The P G1 pin is the open-drain output of an \ninternal comparator . P G1 remains low until the FB1 pin is within ±7.5% of the final regulation voltage, and there \nare no fault conditions. P G1 is pulled low during V IN1 \nUVLO, V CC UVLO, Thermal Shutdown, or when the EN/\nUV1 pin is low.\nPG2 (Pin 15) : The P G2 pin is the open-drain output of an \ninternal comparator . P G2 remains low until the FB2 pin \nis within ±7.5% of the final regulation voltage, and there \nare no fault conditions. P G2 is pulled low during V IN1 \nUVLO, V CC UVLO, Thermal Shutdown, or when both the \nEN/U V2 pin is low.\nSYNC (Pin 16) : External Clock Synchronization Input. \nGround this pin for low ripple Burst Mode operation at \nlow output loads. Apply a DC voltage of 2.8V to 4V or tie \nto VCC for forced continuous mode with spread spectrum \nmodulation. Float the SYNC pin for forced continuous \nmode without spread spectrum modulation. Apply a clock \nsource to the SYNC pin for synchronization to an external \nfrequency. The LT8650 S will be in forced continuous mode \nwhen an external frequency is applied.\nCLKOUT (Pin 17) : In forced continuous mode, the CLKOUT \npin provides a 50% duty cycle square wave 90 degrees \nout of phase with channel 1. This allows synchronization \nwith other regulators with up to four phases. When an \nexternal clock is applied to the SYNC pin, the CLKOUT pin \nwill output a waveform with the same phase, duty cycle, \nand frequency as the SYNC waveform. In burst mode, \nthe CLKOUT pin will be low. Float this pin if the CLKOUT \nfunction is not used.\nBST2 (Pin 18) : This pin is used to provide a drive volt -\nage, higher than the input voltage, to the top side power \nswitch of channel 2.\nSW2 (Pin 19, 20) : The SW2 pin is the output of the chan -\nnel 2 internal power switches. Tie these pins together and \nconnect them to the inductor and boost capacitor . This node \nshould be kept small on the PCB for good performance.\nSW1 (Pin 22, 23) : The SW1 pin is the output of the chan -\nnel 1 internal power switches. Tie these pins together and \nconnect them to the inductor and boost capacitor . This node \nshould be kept small on the PCB for good performance.\nLT8650 S\n11\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS\nBST1 (Pin 24) : This pin is used to provide a drive volt -\nage, higher than the input voltage, to the top side power \nswitch of channel 1.\nVCC (Pin 25) : Internal Regulator Bypass Pin. The internal \npower drivers and control circuits are powered from this \nvoltage. V CC current will be supplied from BIAS if V BIAS > \n3.1V, otherwise current will be drawn from V IN1. Voltage \non V CC will vary between 2.8V and 3.3V when V BIAS is \nbetween 3.0V and 3.5V. Decouple this pin to ground with \nat least a 1μF low ESR ceramic capacitor . Do not load the \nVCC pin with external circuitry.\nBIAS (Pin 26) : The internal regulator will draw current from \nBIAS instead of V IN1 when BIAS is tied to a voltage higher \nthan 3.1V. For output voltages of 3.3V and above this pin \nshould be tied to V OUT. If this pin is tied to a supply other \nthan V OUT use a 1µF local bypass capacitor on this pin.\nVC1 (Pin 27) : Channel 1 Error Amplifier Output and \nSwitching Regulator Compensation Pin. Connect this pin \nto appropriate external components to compensate the \nregulator loop frequency response. Connect this pin to \nVCC to use the default internal compensation. If internal \ncompensation is used, the burst mode quiescent current \nis only 2.5µA  for channel 1. If external compensation is \nused, the burst mode quiescent current is increased to \nabout 50µA  for channel 1.\nFB1 (Pin 28) : The LT8650 S regulates the FB1 pin to 800mV . \nConnect the feedback resistor divider tap to this pin.\nSS1 (Pin 29) : Channel 1 Output T racking and Soft-Start \nPin. This pin allows user control of output voltage ramp \nrate during startup. A S S1 voltage below 0.8V forces the \nLT8650 S to regulate the FB1 pin to equal the S S1 pin \nvoltage. When S S1 is above 0.8V, the tracking function is \ndisabled and the internal reference resumes control of the \nerror amplifier . An internal 2μA pull-up current from V CC \non this pin allows a capacitor to program output voltage \nslew rate. This pin is pulled to ground with an internal 200Ω  MOSFET during shutdown and fault conditions ; use \na series resistor if driving from a low impedance output. \nThis pin may be left floating if the soft-start feature is not \nbeing used.\nSS2 (Pin 30) : Channel 2 Output T racking and Soft-Start \nPin. This pin allows user control of output voltage ramp \nrate during startup. A S S2 voltage below 0.8V forces the \nLT8650 S to regulate the FB2 pin to equal the S S2 pin \nvoltage. When S S2 is above 0.8V, the tracking function is \ndisabled and the internal reference resumes control of the \nerror amplifier . An internal 2μA pull-up current from V CC \non this pin allows a capacitor to program output voltage \nslew rate. This pin is pulled to ground with an internal \n200Ω  MOSFET during shutdown and fault conditions ; use \na series resistor if driving from a low impedance output. \nThis pin may be left floating if the soft-start feature is not \nbeing used.\nFB2 (Pin 31) : The LT8650 S regulates the FB2 pin to 800mV . \nConnect the feedback resistor divider tap to this pin.\nVC2 (Pin 32) : Channel 2 Error Amplifier Output and \nSwitching Regulator Compensation Pin. Connect this pin \nto appropriate external components to compensate the \nregulator loop frequency response. Connect this pin to \nVCC to use the default internal compensation. If internal \ncompensation is used, the burst mode quiescent current \nis only 2.5µA  for channel 2. If external compensation is \nused, the burst mode quiescent current is increased to \nabout 50µA  for channel 2.\nGND (Pin 2, 10, Exposed Pad Pins 33 –38): LT8650 S \nSystem Ground.

C For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nForeword\nThe LT8650 S is a dual monolithic step down regulator . The \ntwo channels are the same in terms of current capability \nand power switch size. The following sections describe \nthe operation of channel 1 and common circuits. They will \nhighlight channel 2 differences and interactions only when \nrelevant. To simplify the application, both V IN1 and V IN2 \nare assumed to be connected to the same input supply. \nHowever , note that V IN1 must be greater than 3V for either \nchannel to operate.\nOperation\nThe LT8650 S is a dual monolithic, constant frequency, peak \ncurrent mode step-down DC/DC converter . An oscillator , \nwith frequency set using a resistor on the RT pin, turns \non the internal top power switch at the beginning of each \nclock cycle. Current in the inductor then increases until \nthe top switch current comparator trips and turns off the \ntop power switch. The peak inductor current at which \nthe top switch turns off is controlled by the voltage on \nthe VC node. The error amplifier servos the VC node by \ncomparing the voltage on the V FB pin with an internal 0.8V \nreference. When the load current increases it causes a \nreduction in the feedback voltage relative to the reference \nleading the error amplifier to raise the VC voltage until the \naverage inductor current matches the new load current. \nWhen the top power switch turns off, the synchronous \npower switch turns on until the next clock cycle begins or \ninductor current falls to zero when not in forced continu -\nous mode (FCM). If overload conditions result in more \nthan the bottom NMOS current limit flowing through the \nbottom switch, the next clock cycle will be delayed until \nswitch current returns to a safe level.\nThe S in LT8650 S refers to the second generation Silent \nSwitcher technology. This technology allows fast switching \nedges for high efficiency at high switching frequencies, \nwhile simultaneously achieving good EMI performance. \nThis includes the integration of ceramic capacitors into \nthe package for V IN1, VIN2, VCC, BST1, and BST2 ( C1 to \nC5 in the Block Diagram ). These caps keep all the fast AC \ncurrent loops small, which improves EMI performance.If either EN/UV pin is low, the corresponding channel is \nshut down. If both EN/UV pins are low, the LT8650 S is fully \nshut down and draws 1.7µA  from the input supply. When \nthe EN/UV pins are above 0.74V , corresponding switching \nregulators will become active. 3.7μA  is supplied by V IN1 \nto common bias circuits for both channels.\nEach channel can independently enter Burst Mode opera -\ntion to optimize efficiency at light load. Between bursts, \nall circuitry associated with controlling the output switch \nis shut down, reducing the channel ’s contribution to \ninput supply current. In a typical application, 6.2μA  will \nbe consumed from input supply when regulating both \nchannels with no load. Ground the SYNC pin for Burst \nMode operation, float it for forced continuous mode (FCM) \nor apply a DC voltage from 2.8V to 4V to use FCM with \nspread spectrum modulation (SSM). If a clock is applied \nto the SYNC pin both channels will synchronize to the \nexternal clock frequency and operate in FCM. While in \nFCM the oscillator operates continuously and rising SW \ntransitions are aligned to the clock. During light loads, \nthe inductor current is allowed to go negative to maintain \nthe programmed switching frequency. Minimum current \nlimits for both power switches are enforced to prevent \nlarge negative inductor current from flowing back to the \ninput. SSM dithers the switching frequency from the \nprogrammed value set by the RT pin up to 20% higher \nthan the programmed value to spread out the switching \nenergy in the frequency domain. The CLKOUT pin has \nno output in Burst Mode, but outputs a square wave 90 \ndegrees phase shifted from channel 1 when in FCM. If a \nclock is applied to the SYNC pin, the CLKOUT pin has the \nsame phase and duty cycle as the external clock.\nTo improve efficiency across all loads, supply current to \ninternal circuitry can be sourced from the BIAS pin when \nbiased at 3.3V or above. Otherwise, the internal circuitry \nwill draw current exclusively from V IN1. The BIAS pin \nshould be connected to the lowest V OUT programmed at \n3.3V or above.\nThe VC pin allows the loop compensation of the switch -\ning regulator to be optimized based on the programmed \nswitching frequency. Internal compensation can be se -\nLT8650 S\n14\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nlected by connecting the VC pin to V CC, which simplifies \nthe application circuit. External compensation improves \nthe transient response at the expense of about 50µA  more \nquiescent current per channel.\nComparators monitoring the FB pin voltage will pull the \ncorresponding PG pin low if the output voltage varies \nmore than ±7.5% (typical) from the regulation voltage or \nif a fault condition is present.\nThe voltage present at the TEMP pin is proportional to \nthe average die temperature of the LT8650 S. The TEMP \npin will be 250mV  for a die temperature of 25°C and will \nhave a slope of 9.5mV /°CT racking soft-start is implemented by providing constant \ncurrent via the SS pin to an external soft-start capacitor \nto generate a voltage ramp. FB voltage is regulated to \nthe voltage at the SS pin until it exceeds 0.8V; FB is then \nregulated to the reference 0.8V. When the SS pin is below \n40mV , the corresponding switching regulator will stop \nswitching. The SS capacitor is reset during shutdown, \nVIN1 undervoltage, or thermal shutdown.\nBoth channels are designed for output currents up to 6A, \nbut thermal considerations practically limit the output \ncurrents to 4A of continuous current from each channel \nsimultaneously. Channel 1 has a minimum V IN1 require -\nment of 3V, channel 2 can operate with no minimum V IN2 \nprovided the minimum V IN1 has been satisfied.\nLT8650 S\n15\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nAchieving Ultralow Quiescent Current\nTo enhance efficiency at light loads, the LT8650 S operates \nin low ripple Burst Mode operation, which keeps the out -\nput capacitor charged to the desired output voltage while \nminimizing the input quiescent current and minimizing \noutput voltage ripple. 3.7μA  is supplied by V IN1 to com -\nmon bias circuits. In Burst Mode operation the LT8650 S \ndelivers single small pulses of current to the output ca -\npacitor followed by sleep periods where the output power \nis supplied by the output capacitor . While in sleep mode \nboth channels consume a combined 6.2μA .\nAs the output load decreases, the frequency of single cur -\nrent pulses decreases (see Figure\xa01 ) and the percentage of \ntime the LT8650 S is in sleep mode increases, resulting in \nmuch higher light load efficiency than for typical convert -\ners. By maximizing the time between pulses, the converter \nquiescent current approaches 6.2µA  for a typical application \nwhen there is no output load. Therefore, to optimize the \nquiescent current performance at light loads, the current \nin the feedback resistor divider must be minimized as it \nappears to the output as load current.\nWhile in Burst Mode operation the current limit of the top \nswitch is approximately 1.2A resulting in output voltage \nripple shown in Figure\xa0 2 . Increasing the output capacitance \nwill decrease the output ripple proportionally. As load ramps \nupward from zero the switching frequency will increase \nbut only up to the switching frequency programmed by \nthe resistor at the RT pin as shown in Figure\xa01 . The out -\nput load at which the LT8650 S reaches the programmed \nfrequency varies based on input voltage, output voltage, \nand inductor choice.\nFor some applications it is desirable to select forced con -\ntinuous mode (FCM) to maintain full switching frequency \ndown to zero output load.

The \nadvantage of high frequency operation is that smaller induc -\ntor and capacitor values may be used. The disadvantages \nare lower efficiency and a smaller input voltage range.\nThe highest switching frequency (f SW(MAX) ) for a given \napplication can be calculated as follows :\n  fSW(MAX)=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\ntON(MIN)VIN–VSW(TOP)+VSW(BOT) ( )\nwhere V IN is the typical input voltage, V OUT is the output \nvoltage, V SW(TOP)  and V SW(BOT)  are the internal switch \ndrops ( ~0.3V, ~0.12V , respectively at maximum load) and \ntON(MIN)  is the minimum top switch on-time of 60ns  (see \nthe Electrical Characteristics ). This equation shows that a \nslower switching frequency is necessary to accommodate \na high V IN/VOUT ratio. Choose the switching frequency \nbased on which channel has the lower frequency constraint.If low input quiescent current and good light-load efficiency \nare desired, use large resistor values for the FB resistor \ndivider . The current flowing in the divider acts as a load \ncurrent, and will increase the no-load input current to the \nconverter , which is approximately :\n IQ=3.7µA+VOUT1\nR1+R2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟VOUT1\nVIN1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟1\nn⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nwhere 3.7µA  is the quiescent current of channel 1 and \ncommon circuitries, the second term is the current in the \nfeedback divider reflected to the input of channel 1 oper -\nating at its light load efficiency n. For a 3.3V application \nwith R1 = 1M and R2 = 316k , the feedback divider draws \n2.5µA . With V IN = 12V and n = 80%, this adds 0.9µA  to the \n3.7µA  quiescent current resulting in 4.6µA  no-load current \nfrom the 12V supply. Note that this equation implies that \nthe no-load current is a function of V IN; this is plotted in \nthe Typical Performance Characteristics  section.\nA similar calculation can be done to determine the input \ncurrent contribution from the channel 2 feedback resis -\ntors. For a 5V application with R3 = 1M, R4 = 191k , VIN \n= 12V, and h = 80%, this adds 2.2µA  to the input current \nresulting in a total of 6.8µA  with both channels on.\nFor a typical FB resistor of 1M, a 4.7pF  to 10pF  phase-lead \ncapacitor should be connected from V OUT to FB.\nSetting the Switching Frequency\nThe LT8650 S uses a constant frequency PWM architecture \nthat can be programmed to switch from 300kHz  to 3MHz  \nby using a resistor tied from the RT pin to ground. Table\xa01  \nshows the necessary R T value for a desired switching \nfrequency.\nThe R T resistor required for a desired switching frequency \ncan be calculated using :\n  RT=41.7\nfSW–5.8\nwhere R T is in kΩ and f SW is the desired switching fre -\nquency in MHz.\nLT8650 S\n17\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFor transient operation, V IN may go as high as the abso -\nlute maximum rating of 42V regardless of the R T value, \nhowever the LT8650 S will reduce switching frequency \non each channel independently as necessary to maintain \ncontrol of inductor current to assure safe operation.\nIn Burst Mode, the LT8650 S is capable of a maximum duty \ncycle of greater than 99%, and the V IN to V OUT dropout is \nlimited by the R DS(ON)  of the top switch. In this mode the \nchannel that enters dropout skips switch cycles, resulting \nin a lower switching frequency. In forced continuous mode, \nthe LT8650 S will not skip cycles to achieve a higher duty \ncycle. The part will maintain the programmed switching \nfrequency and the dropout voltage will be larger due to \nthe smaller maximum duty cycle.\nFor applications that cannot allow deviation from the pro -\ngrammed switching frequency at low V IN/VOUT ratios use \nthe following formula to set switching frequency :\n  VIN(MIN)=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\n1–fSW•tOFF(MIN)–VSW(BOT)+VSW(TOP)\nwhere V IN(MIN)  is the minimum input voltage without \nskipped cycles, V OUT is the output voltage, V SW(TOP)  and \nVSW(BOT)  are the internal switch drops ( ~0.3V, ~0.12V , \nrespectively at maximum load), f SW is the switching fre -\nquency (set by R T), and t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum switch \noff-time. Note that higher switching frequency will increase \nthe minimum input voltage below which cycles will be \ndropped to achieve higher duty cycle.\nNote there is no minimum V IN2 voltage requirement as it \ndoes not supply the internal common bias circuits, making \nthe channel 2 uniquely capable of operating from very low \ninput voltages as long as V IN1 has a supply of 3V or greater .\nInductor Selection and Maximum Output Current\nThe LT8650 S is designed to minimize solution size by \nallowing the inductor to be chosen based on the output \nload requirements of the application. During overload \nor short-circuit conditions the LT8650 S safely tolerates \noperation with a saturated inductor through the use of a \nhigh speed peak-current mode architecture.A good first choice for the inductor value is :\n  L1,2=VOUT1,2+VSW(BOT)\n2fSW\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency in MHz, V OUT is the \noutput voltage, V SW(BOT)  is the bottom switch drop ( ~0.12V ) \nand L is the inductor value in μH. To avoid overheating and \npoor efficiency, an inductor must be chosen with an RMS \ncurrent rating that is greater than the maximum expected \noutput load of the application. In addition, the saturation \ncurrent (typically labeled I SAT) rating of the inductor must \nbe higher than the load current plus 1/2 of in inductor \nripple current :\n IL(PEAK)=ILOAD(MAX)+1\n2ΔIL\nwhere ∆IL is the inductor ripple current as calculated in \nEquation 1  and I LOAD(MAX)  is the maximum output load \nfor a given application.\nAs a quick example, an application requiring 1A output \nshould use an inductor with an RMS rating of greater than \n1A and an I SAT of greater than 1.3A. During long duration \noverload or short-circuit conditions, the inductor RMS rat -\ning requirement must be greater to avoid overheating of the \ninductor . To keep the efficiency high, the series resistance \n(DCR) should be less than 0.04Ω , and the core material \nshould be intended for high frequency applications.\nThe LT8650 S limits the peak switch current in order to \nprotect the switches and the system from overload faults. \nThe top switch current limit (I LIM) is at least 10A at low \nduty cycles and decreases linearly to 7A at DC = 0.8. The \ninductor value must then be sufficient to supply the desired \nmaximum output current (I OUT(MAX) ), which is a function \nof the switch current limit (I LIM) and the ripple current.\n IOUT(MAX)=ILIM–ΔIL\n2\nThe peak-to-peak ripple current in the inductor can be \ncalculated as follows :\n ΔIL=VOUT\nL•fSW•1–VOUT\nVIN(MAX)⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟ (1)\nLT8650 S\n18\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency of the LT8650 S, and \nL is the value of the inductor . Therefore, the maximum \noutput current that the LT8650 S will deliver depends on \nthe switch current limit, the inductor value, and the input \nand output voltages.\nEach channel has a secondary bottom switch current limit. \nAfter the top switch has turned off, the bottom switch carries \nthe inductor current. If for any reason the inductor current \nis too high, the bottom switch will remain on, delaying the \ntop switch turning on until the inductor current returns to \na safe level. This level is specified as the Bottom NMOS \nCurrent Limit, and is independent of duty cycle. Maximum \noutput current in the application circuit is limited to this \nvalley current plus one half of the inductor ripple current.\nIn most cases current limit is enforced by the top switch. \nThe bottom switch limit controls the inductor current when \nthe minimum on-time condition is violated (high input \nvoltage, high frequency or saturated inductor).\nThe bottom switch current limit is designed to be equal to \nthe peak current limit to avoid any contribution to maximum \nrated current of the LT8650 S.\nFor more information about maximum output current and \ndiscontinuous operation, see Analog Devices Application \nNote 44 .\nFinally, for duty cycles greater than 50% (V OUT/VIN > 0.5), \na minimum inductance is required to avoid sub-harmonic \noscillation.

Y5V types have poor performance \nover temperature and applied voltage, and should not \nbe used. A 4.7μF  to 10μF  ceramic capacitor is adequate \nto bypass the LT8650 S and will easily handle the ripple current. Note that larger input capacitance is required \nwhen a lower switching frequency is used. If the input \npower source has high impedance, or there is significant \ninductance due to long wires or cables, additional bulk \ncapacitance may be necessary. This can be provided with \na low performance electrolytic capacitor .\nStep-down regulators draw current from the input sup -\nply in pulses with very fast rise and fall times. The input \ncapacitor is required to reduce the resulting voltage ripple \nat the LT8650 S and to force this very high frequency \nswitching current into a tight local loop, minimizing EMI. \nTypically a 0.1µF  capacitor in a small 0402 case size is \nplaced as close as possible to the LT8650 S and a larger \nbulk ceramic is added for more capacitance (see the PCB \nLayout  section). A second precaution regarding the ceramic \ninput capacitor concerns the maximum input voltage rat -\ning of the LT8650 S. A ceramic input capacitor combined \nwith trace or cable inductance forms a high quality (under \ndamped) tank circuit. If the LT8650 S circuit is plugged \ninto a live supply, the input voltage can ring to twice its \nnominal value, possibly exceeding the LT8650 S’s voltage \nrating. This situation is easily avoided (see Analog Devices \nApplication Note 88 ).\nOutput Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor has two essential functions. Along \nwith the inductor , it filters the square wave generated by \nthe LT8650 S to produce the DC output. In this role it \ndetermines the output ripple, thus low impedance at the \nswitching frequency is important. The second function \nis to store energy in order to satisfy transient loads and \nstabilize the LT8650 S’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors \nhave very low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and \nprovide the best ripple performance. For good starting \nvalues, see the Typical Applications  section.\nUse X5R or X7R types. This choice will provide low output \nripple and good transient response. T ransient performance \ncan be improved with a higher value output capacitor and \nthe addition of a feed forward capacitor placed between \nVOUT and FB. Increasing the output capacitance will also \ndecrease the output voltage ripple. A lower value of output \ncapacitor can be used to save space and cost but transient \nLT8650 S\n19\nRev.

See \nthe Typical Applications  in this data sheet for suggested \ncapacitor values.\nWhen choosing a capacitor , special attention should be \ngiven to the data sheet to calculate the effective capacitance \nunder the relevant operating conditions of voltage bias and \ntemperature. A physically larger capacitor or one with a \nhigher voltage rating may be required.\nCeramic Capacitors\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However , ceramic capacitors can cause problems \nwhen used with the LT8650 S due to their piezoelectric \nnature. When in Burst Mode operation, the LT8650 S’s \nswitching frequency depends on the load current, and \nat very light loads the LT8650 S can excite the ceramic \ncapacitor at audio frequencies, generating audible noise. \nSince the LT8650 S operates at a lower current limit during \nBurst Mode operation, the noise is typically very quiet to a \ncasual ear . If this is unacceptable, use a high performance \ntantalum or electrolytic capacitor at the output. Low noise \nceramic capacitors are also available.\nTable\xa03. Ceramic Capacitor Manufacturers\nMANUFACTURER WEB\nTaiyo Yuden www.t-yuden.com\nAVX www.avxcorp.com\nMurata www.murata.com\nTDK www.tdk.com\nEnable Pin\nThe LT8650 S is in shutdown when both EN/UV pins are low \nand active when either pin is high. The rising threshold of \nthe EN/UV comparator is 0.74V , with 30mV  of hysteresis. \nThe EN/UV pins can be tied to V IN if the shutdown feature \nis not used, or tied to a logic level if shutdown control is \nrequired.\nAdding a resistor divider from V IN to EN/UV programs \nthe LT8650 S to operate only when V IN is above a desired \nvoltage (see the Block Diagram ). Typically, this threshold, \nVIN(EN) , is used in situations where the input supply is cur -\nrent limited, or has a relatively high source resistance. A switching regulator draws constant power from the source, \nso source current increases as source voltage drops. This \nlooks like a negative resistance load to the source and can \ncause the source to current limit or latch low under low \nsource voltage conditions. The V IN(EN)  threshold prevents \nthe regulator from operating at source voltages where the \nproblems might occur . This threshold can be adjusted by \nsetting the values R5 and R6 (R7 and R8 for channel 2) \nsuch that they satisfy the following equation :\n VIN(EN)=R5\nR6+1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•0.74V\nwhere the corresponding channel will remain off until V IN is \nabove V IN(EN) . Due to the comparator ’s hysteresis, switch -\ning will not stop until the input falls slightly below V IN(EN) .\nWhen operating in Burst Mode operation for light load \ncurrents, the current through the V IN(EN)  resistor network \ncan easily be greater than the supply current consumed \nby the LT8650 S. Therefore, the V IN(EN)  resistors should \nbe large to minimize their effect on efficiency at low loads.\nVCC Regulator\nAn internal low dropout (LDO) regulator produces the 3.4V \nsupply from V IN1 that powers the drivers and the internal \nbias circuitry. For this reason, V IN1 must be present and \nvalid to use either channel. The V CC can supply enough \ncurrent for the LT8650 S’s circuitry and must be bypassed \nto ground with a 1μF ceramic capacitor . Good bypassing is \nnecessary to supply the high transient currents required \nby the power MOSFET gate drivers. To improve efficiency \nthe internal LDO can also draw current from the BIAS pin \nwhen the BIAS pin is at 3.1V or higher . Typically the BIAS \npin can be tied to the lowest output or external supply \nabove 3.1V. If BIAS is connected to a supply other than \nVOUT, be sure to bypass with a local ceramic capacitor . If \nthe BIAS pin is below 3V, the internal LDO will consume \ncurrent from V IN1.\nApplications with high input voltage and high switching \nfrequency where the internal LDO pulls current from V IN1 \nwill increase die temperature because of the higher power \ndissipation across the LDO. Do not connect an external \nload to the V CC pin.\nLT8650 S\n20\nRev.

If the VC pins are \nshorted to V CC, then internal compensation is used. This \nsimplifies the circuit design and minimizes the quiescent \ncurrent, but since the internal compensation has to be \nstable across the 300kHz  to 3MHz  range of switching \nfrequencies, the internal compensation will not be opti -\nmal, especially at high switching frequencies. If the best \ntransient response is desired, an external compensation \nnetwork can be connected to the VC pin, which usually \nconsists of a series resistor and capacitor (see R C and C C \nin the Block Diagram ).\nDesigning the compensation network is a bit complicated \nand the best values depend on the application and in par -\nticular the type of output capacitor . A practical approach \nis to start with one of the circuits in the data sheet that \nis similar to your application and tune the compensation \nnetwork to optimize the performance. L Tspice® simulations \ncan help in this process. Stability should then be checked \nacross all operating conditions, including load current, \ninput voltage, and temperature.\nFigure\xa0 3  shows an equivalent circuit for the LT8650 S \ncontrol loop. The error amplifier is a transconductance \namplifier with finite output impedance. The power section, \nconsisting of the modulator , power switches, and inductor , \nis modeled as a transconductance amplifier generating an \noutput current proportional to the voltage at the VC pin. Note that the output capacitor integrates this current and \nthat the capacitor on the VC pin (C C) integrates the error \namplifier output current, resulting in two poles in the loop. \nA zero is required and comes from a resistor R C in series \nwith C C. This simple model works well as long as the value \nof the inductor is not too high and the loop crossover \nfrequency is much lower than the switching frequency. A \nphase lead capacitor (C PL) across the feedback divider can \nbe used to improve the transient response and is required \nto cancel the parasitic pole caused by the feedback node \nto ground capacitance.\nFigure\xa0 4a shows the transient response for the front page \napplication which uses internal compensation.

C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa05. SS Pin T rackingOutput Voltage T racking and Soft-Start\nThe LT8650 S allows the user to program its output voltage \nramp rate with the SS pin. An internal 2μA current pulls \nup the SS pin to V CC. Putting an external capacitor on SS \nenables soft starting the output to prevent current surge \non the input supply. During the soft-start ramp the output \nvoltage will proportionally track the SS pin voltage. For \noutput tracking applications, SS can be externally driven \nby another voltage source. From 0V to 0.04V , the SS pin \nwill stop the corresponding channel from switching, thus \nallowing the SS pin to be used as a shutdown pin. From \n0.04V  to 0.8V, the SS voltage will override the internal \n0.8V reference input to the error amplifier , thus regulating \nthe FB pin voltage to that of SS pin ( Figure\xa05 ). When SS is \nabove 0.8V, tracking is disabled and the feedback voltage \nwill regulate to the internal reference voltage. The SS pin \nmay be left floating if the function is not needed. Note that \nin both Burst Mode and forced continuous mode (FCM) \nthe LT8650 S will not discharge the output to regulate to a \nlower SS voltage. This is achieved by disabling FCM when \nthe SS voltage is below 2V.\nIn Burst Mode operation (SYNC low), an active pull-down \ncircuit is connected to the SS pin which will discharge the \nexternal soft-start capacitor in the case of fault conditions \nand restart the ramp when the faults are cleared. Fault \nconditions that clear the soft-start capacitor are the cor -\nresponding EN/UV pin below 0.74V , VIN1 voltage falling \ntoo low, or thermal shutdown.Output Power Good\nWhen the LT8650 S’s output voltage is within the ±7.5% \nwindow of the regulation point, which is a FB voltage in \nthe range of 0.74V  to 0.86V  (typical), the output voltage \nis considered good and the open-drain PG pin goes high \nimpedance and is typically pulled high with an external \nresistor . Otherwise, the internal pull-down device will pull \nthe PG pin low. To prevent glitching both the upper and \nlower thresholds include 0.3% of hysteresis.\nThe PG pin is also actively pulled low during several fault \nconditions : corresponding EN/UV pin below 0.74V , VCC \nvoltage falling too low, V IN1 under voltage, or thermal \nshutdown.\nSequencing\nStartup sequencing and tracking can be configured in sev -\neral ways with the LT8650 S. One channel can be required \nto be valid before enabling the other channel to sequence \ntheir startup order . This can be done by connecting the \nPG pin of the first channel to either the EN/UV pin or SS \npin of the second channel. The SS pin of the first channel \ncan also be connected to the EN/UV pin of the second \nchannel (see Figure\xa06 ).\nThe channels can also be started at the same time where \nthe output voltages can track in a ratiometric fashion (see \nFigure\xa06 ).\nParalleling\nTo increase the possible output current the two channels \ncan be connected in parallel to the same output. To do this \nthe VC, SS, and FB pins of each channel are connected \ntogether , while each channel ’s SW node is connected to \nthe common output through its own inductor . External \ncompensation network must be used when paralleling \noutputs. Figure\xa0 7  shows an application where the two \nchannels of one LT8650 S regulator are combined to get \none output capable of 8A DC with 12A peak transients.\nSS VOL TAGE (V)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nFB VOL TAGE (V)\n8650s F05\nLT8650 S\n22\nRev.

T wo-Phase Application\nLT8650 S\n23\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSynchronization\nTo select low ripple Burst Mode operation, tie the SYNC \npin below 0.4V (this can be ground or a logic low output). \nTo select forced continuous mode (FCM), float the SYNC \npin. To select FCM with spread spectrum modulation \n(SSM), tie the SYNC pin above 2.8V (SYNC can be tied to \nVCC). To synchronize the LT8650 S oscillator to an external \nfrequency connect a square wave (with 20% to 80% duty \ncycle) to the SYNC pin. The square wave amplitude should \nhave valleys that are below 0.4V and peaks above 1.5V \n(up to 6V). When synchronized to an external clock the \nLT8650 S will use FCM.\nChannel 1 will synchronize its positive switch edge transi -\ntions to the positive edge of the SYNC signal, and channel \n2 will synchronize to the negative edge of the SYNC signal.\nThe LT8650 S may be synchronized over a 300kHz  to \n3MHz  range. The R T resistor should be chosen to set the \nLT8650 S switching frequency equal to or below the lowest \nsynchronization input. For example, if the synchronization \nsignal will be 500kHz  and higher , the R T should be selected \nfor nominal 500kHz .\nThe slope compensation is set by the R T value, while the \nminimum slope compensation required to avoid sub-\nharmonic oscillations is established by the inductor size, \ninput voltage, and output voltage. Since the synchroniza -\ntion frequency will not change the slopes of the inductor \ncurrent waveform, if the inductor is large enough to avoid \nsubharmonic oscillations at the frequency set by R T, then \nthe slope compensation will be sufficient for all synchro -\nnization frequencies.\nA synchronizing signal that incorporates spread spectrum \nmay reduce EMI. The duty cycle of the SYNC signal can \nbe used to set the relative phasing of the two channels \nfor minimizing input ripple.\nForced Continuous Mode\nForced continuous mode (FCM) is activated by either float -\ning the SYNC pin, tying the SYNC pin to V CC, applying a \nDC voltage above 2.8V to the SYNC pin, or applying an \nexternal clock to the SYNC pin.While in FCM discontinuous mode operation is disabled \nand the inductor current is allowed to go negative so that \nthe regulator can switch at the programmed frequency \nall the way down to zero output current. This has the \nadvantage of maintaining the programmed switching \nfrequency across the entire load range so that the switch \nharmonics and EMI are consistent and predictable. The \ndisadvantage of FCM is that the light load efficiency will \nbe low compared to Burst Mode operation.\nAt low input voltages when the part enters dropout, the \nprogrammed switching frequency will be maintained \nand off time skipping will not be allowed. This keeps the \nswitching frequency controlled, but the dropout voltage \nwill be higher than in burst mode, due to maximum duty \ncycle constraints.\nThe negative inductor current is limited to a maximum of \nabout –2.5A, so the LT8650 S can only sink a maximum of \nabout –1.3A. This prevents boosting an excessive amount \nof current back from the output to the input. FCM is dis -\nabled if the input voltage is greater than 37V to prevent \novervoltaging the LT8650 S if the input capacitor is charged \nwhen sinking current from the output. Additional safety \nfeatures include disabling FCM when the SS pin voltage is \nbelow 1.8V to prevent discharging the output when start -\ning up into a pre-biased output, and a bottom FET current \nlimit to prevent over charging the output if the minimum \non time is violated.\nSpread Spectrum Modulation\nSpread spectrum modulation (SSM) is activated by tying \nthe SYNC pin to V CC or applying a DC voltage from 2.8V \nto 4V to the SYNC pin. SSM reduces the EMI emissions \nby modulating the switching frequency between the value \nprogrammed by RT to approximately 20% higher than that \nvalue. The switching frequency is modulated linearly up \nand then linearly down at a 5kHz  rate. This is an analog \nfunction, so each switching period will be different than \nthe previous one. For example, when the LT8650 S is \nprogrammed to 2MHz  and the SSM feature is enabled, \nthe switching frequency will vary from 2MHz  to 2.4MHz  \nat a 5kHz  rate. When in SSM, the part will also operate in \nforced continuous mode.\nLT8650 S\n24\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nClock Output\nThe CLKOUT pin outputs a clock which can be used to \nsynchronous other regulators to the LT8650 S. In Burst \nMode (SYNC pin low), the CLKOUT pin is grounded. In \nforced continuous mode (SYNC pin float or DC high), the \nCLKOUT pin outputs a 50% duty cycle clock where the \nCLKOUT rising edge is approximately 90 degrees phase \nshifted relative to channel 1. If this CLKOUT waveform is \napplied to the SYNC pin of another LT8650 S regulator , \nthen four-phase operation can be achieved. If an external \nclock is applied to the SYNC pin of the LT8650 S, then the \nCLKOUT pin will output a waveform with the same phasing \nand duty cycle as the SYNC pin clock. The low and high \nlevels of the CLKOUT pin are ground and V CC, respectively. \nThe drive strength of the CLKOUT pin is several hundred \nohms, so the CLKOUT waveform has rise and fall times \nof several tens of ns. The edge rates will be slower if the \nCLKOUT trace has extra capacitance.\nTemperature Monitor Function\nThe TEMP pin will output a voltage proportional to die \ntemperature. The TEMP pin typically outputs 250mV  for \n25°C and has a slope of 9.5mV /°C. Without the aid of an \nexternal circuitry, the TEMP pin output is valid from 20°C \nto 150°C (200mV  to 1.5V). Do not load the TEMP pin with \nmore than 100µA . To extend the TEMP pin output below \n20°C, connect a resistor from the TEMP pin to a negative \nvoltage.\nAs a safeguard, the LT8650 S has an additional thermal \nshutdown set at a typical value of 165°C. If the thermal \nshutdown is exceeded, both channels of the LT8650 S will \nbe shutdown until the thermal overload event expires.\nIt should be noted that the TEMP pin voltage represents \nthe steady-state, average die temperature and should not \nbe used to guarantee that maximum junction temperatures \nare not exceeded. Instantaneous power along with ther -\nmal gradients and time constants may cause portions of \nthe die to exceed maximum ratings. Be sure to calculate \ndie temperature rise for steady state ( >1 Min) as well as \nimpulse conditions.Shorted and Reversed Input Protection\nThe LT8650 S will tolerate a shorted output. The bottom \nswitch current is monitored such that if inductor current \nis beyond safe levels switching of the top switch will be \ndelayed until such time as the inductor current falls to \nsafe levels. Fault condition of one channel will not affect \nthe operation of the other channel, unless the part goes \ninto thermal shutdown.\nThere is another situation to consider in systems where the \noutput will be held high when the input to the LT8650 S is \nabsent. This may occur in battery charging applications or \nin battery backup systems where a battery or some other \nsupply is ORed with channel 1 ’s output. If the V IN1 pin is \nallowed to float and either EN/UV pin is held high (either \nby a logic signal or because it is tied to V IN1), then the \nLT8650 S’s internal circuitry will pull its quiescent current \nthrough its SW1 pin. This is acceptable if the system can \ntolerate current draw in this state. If both EN/UV pins are \ngrounded the SW1 pin current will drop to near 1.7µA . \nHowever , if the V IN1 pin is grounded while channel 1 output \nis held high, regardless of EN/U V1, parasitic body diodes \ninside the LT8650 S can pull current from the output \nthrough the SW1 pin and the V IN1 pin, damaging the IC.\nVIN2 is not connected to the shared internal supply and \nwill not draw any current if left floating. If both V IN1 and \nVIN2 are floating, regardless of EN/UV pins states, no load \nwill be present at the output of channel 2. However , if the \nVIN2 pin is grounded while channel 2 output is held high, \nparasitic body diodes inside the LT8650 S can pull current \nfrom the output through the SW2 pin and the V IN2 pin, \ndamaging the IC.\nFigure\xa08  shows a connection of the V IN and EN/UV pins \nthat will allow the LT8650 S to run only when the input \nvoltage is present and that protects against a shorted or \nreversed input.\nFigure\xa08.

C For more information www.analog.comthe bottom of the package must be soldered to a ground \nplane. This ground should be tied to large copper layers \nbelow with thermal vias ; these layers will spread heat dis -\nsipated by the LT8650 S. Placing additional vias can reduce \nthermal resistance further . The maximum load current \nshould be derated as the ambient temperature approaches \nthe maximum junction rating. Power dissipation within the \nLT8650 S can be estimated by calculating the total power \nloss from an efficiency measurement and subtracting \nthe inductor loss. The die temperature is calculated by \nmultiplying the LT8650 S power dissipation by the thermal \nresistance from junction to ambient.\nThe internal thermal shutdown protection of LT8650 S will \nstop switching and indicate a fault condition if junction \ntemperature exceeds 165°C. The fault condition will clear \nand switching resume when the temperature drops back \nbelow 160°C.\nTemperature rise of the LT8650 S is worst when operating \nat high load, high V IN, and high switching frequency. If \nthe case temperature is too high for a given application, \nthen either V IN, switching frequency, or load current can \nbe decreased to reduce the temperature to an acceptable \nlevel. Figure\xa010  shows examples case temperature vs V IN, \nswitching frequency, and load.\nThe LT8650 S’s internal power switches are capable of safely \ndelivering up to 6A of peak output current. However , due \nto thermal limits, the package can only handle 6A loads \nfor short periods of time. Figure\xa011  shows an example of \nhow case temperature rise changes with the duty cycle \nof a 1kHz  pulsed 6A load.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPCB Layout\nFor proper operation and minimum EMI, care must be taken \nduring printed circuit board layout. Figure\xa09  shows the \nrecommended component placement with trace, ground \nplane and via locations. Note that large, switched currents \nflow in the LT8650 S’s VIN pins, GND pins, and the input \ncapacitors. The loop formed by the input capacitor should \nbe as small as possible by placing the capacitor adjacent \nto the V IN and GND pins. When using a physically large \ninput capacitor the resulting loop may become too large \nin which case using a small case/value capacitor placed \nclose to the V IN and GND pins plus a larger capacitor \nfurther away is preferred. These components, along with \nthe inductor and output capacitor , should be placed on \nthe same side of the circuit board, and their connections \nshould be made on that layer . Place a local, unbroken \nground plane under the application circuit on the layer \nclosest to the surface layer . The SW and BOOST nodes \nshould be as small as possible. Finally, keep the FB and \nRT nodes small so that the ground traces will shield them \nfrom the SW and BOOST nodes. The exposed pad acts \nas a heat sink and is connected electrically to ground. To \nkeep thermal resistance low, extend the ground plane as \nmuch as possible, and add thermal vias under and near \nthe LT8650 S to additional ground planes within the circuit \nboard and on the bottom side. See Figure\xa09  for example \nPCB layout.\nHigh Temperature Considerations\nCare should be taken in the layout of the PCB to ensure \ngood heat sinking of the LT8650 S.
