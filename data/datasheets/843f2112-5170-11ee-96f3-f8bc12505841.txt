stress and mounting\nFerrite cores have to meet mechanical requirements during assem bling and for a growing number\nof applications. Since ferrites are ceramic materials one has t o be aware of the special behavior\nunder mechanical load.\nAs valid for any ceramic material, ferrite cores are brittle an d sensitive to any shock, fast tempera-\nture changing or tensile load. Especially high cooling rates un der ultrasonic cleaning and high static\nor cyclic loads can cause cracks or failure of the ferrite core s.\nFor detailed information see data book, chapter “General - Definitions, 8.1” .\nEffects of core combination on AL value \nStresses in the core affect not only the mechanical but also th e magnetic properties. It is apparent\nthat the initial permeability is  dependent on the stress state of the core. The higher the stresses are\nin the core, the lower is the v alue for the initial permeabilit y. Thus the embedding medium should\nhave the greatest possible elasticity.\nFor detailed information see data book, chapter “General - Definitions, 8.1” .\nHeating up\nFerrites can run hot during oper ation at higher flux densities and higher frequencies.\nNiZn-materials \nThe magnetic properties of NiZn-m aterials can change irreversib le in high magnetic fields.\nFerrite Accessories\nEPCOS ferrite accessories have been designed and evaluated only  in combination with EPCOS\nferrite cores. EPCOS explicitly points out that EPCOS ferrite a ccessories or EPCOS ferrite cores\nmay not be compatible with those of other manufacturers. Any su ch combination requires prior te-\nsting by the customer and will be at the customer‘s own risk.\nEPCOS assumes no warranty or re liability for the combination of  EPCOS ferrite accessories with\ncores and other accessories f rom any other manufacturer.\nProcessing remarks\nThe start of the winding process should be soft. Else the flang es may be destroyed.\n– Too strong winding forces may blast the flanges or squeeze the  tube that the cores can not be \nmounted any more.\n– Too long soldering time at high  temperature (>300 °C) may effec t coplanarity or pin arrange-\nment.\n– Not following the processing notes for soldering of the J-leg terminals may cause solderability \nproblems at the transformer bec ause of pollution with Sn oxyde of the tin bath or burned insula-\ntion of the wire. For detail ed information see chapter “Processing notes” , section 2.2.\n– The dimensions of the hole arr angement have fixed values and s hould be understood as\na recommendation for drilling the printed circuit board. For di mensioning the pins, the group\nof holes can only be seen under certain conditions, as they fit  into the given hole arrangement.\nTo avoid problems when mounting the transformer, the manufactur ing tolerances for positioning \nthe customers’ drilling process m ust be considered by increasin g the hole diameter.Cautions and warningsFerrites and accessories\nCautions and warnings\n13 5/17Please read Cautions and warnings and \nImportant notes at the end of this document.Ferrites and accessories\nDisplay of ordering co des for EPCOS products\nThe ordering code for one and th e same product can be represent ed differently in data sheets, \ndata books, other publications and the website of EPCOS, or in order-related documents such as\nshipping notes, order confir mations and product labels.
