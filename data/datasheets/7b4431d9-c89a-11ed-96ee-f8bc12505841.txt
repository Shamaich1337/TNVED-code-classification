General description\nThe PCA9507 is a 2-wire serial bus extender providing 3.3 V to 5 V level shift that allows\nup to 18 meters bus extension for reliable DDC, I2C-bus or SMBus applications. While\nretaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system during the level\nshifts, it also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional buffering for both\nthe data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) line as well as the rise time accelerator on port Aenabling the bus to drive a load up to 1400 pF or distance of 18 m on port A, and 400 pFonport B.UsingthePCA9507enablesthesystemdesignertoisolatebuscapacitancetomeet HDMI DDC version 1.3 distance speciﬁcation. The SDA and SCL pins areovervoltage tolerant and are high-impedance when the PCA9507 is unpowered.\nThe port B drivers with static level offset behave much like the drivers on the PCA9515\ndevice, while the port A drivers integrate the rise time accelerator, sink more current andeliminatethestaticoffsetvoltage.ThisresultsinaLOWonport Btranslatingintoanearly0 V LOW on port A. The static level offset design of the port B I/O drivers prevent themfrom being connected to another device that has rise time accelerator including thePCA9510, PCA9511, PCA9512, PCA9513, PCA9514, PCA9515, PCA9516A, PCA9517(B-side), or PCA9518. The port A sides of two or more PCA9507s can be connectedtogether, however, to allow a star topography with port A on the common bus, and port Acanbeconnecteddirectlytoanyotherbufferwithstaticordynamicoffsetvoltage.MultiplePCA9507s can be connected in series, port A to port B, with no build-up in offset voltagewith only time of ﬂight delays to consider. Rise time accelerator on port A is turned onwhen input threshold is above 0.3V\nCC(A).\nThe PCA9507 drivers are not enabled unless V CC(A) and VCC(B) are above 2.7 V. The EN\npin can also be used to turn the drivers on and off under system control. Caution shouldbe observed to only change the state of the enable pin when the bus is idle. The outputpull-down on the port B internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.5 V, while the inputthreshold of the internal buffer is set about 70 mV lower (0.43 V). When the port B I/O isdriven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input. This prevents alock-up condition from occurring.\n2.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThistextprovidesaverybriefinsightintoacomplextechnology.Amorein-depthaccount\nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reﬂow\nsoldering description” .\n13.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached toPrintedCircuitBoards(PCBs),toformelectricalcircuits.Thesolderedjointprovidesboththe mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that isideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole andSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is notsuitable for ﬁne pitch SMDs. Reﬂow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and highdensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n13.2 Wave and reﬂow soldering\nWavesolderingisajoiningtechnologyinwhichthejointsaremadebysoldercomingfroma standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless\npackages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,due to an increased probability of bridging.\nThe reﬂow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by\ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature proﬁle. Leaded packages,packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reﬂow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reﬂow soldering are:\n•Board speciﬁcations, including the board ﬁnish, solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n13.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhesive and ﬂux, clinching of leads, board\ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components areexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath speciﬁcations, including temperature and impurities\nPCA9507_1 © NXP B.V. 2008.

It is imperative that the peaktemperatureishighenoughforthesoldertomakereliablesolderjoints(asolderpastecharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that thepackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the packagedepends on package thickness and volume and is classiﬁed in accordance with\nTable7 and8\nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all\ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reﬂow\nsoldering, see Figure19.Table 7.

#### Description:
The PCA9507 is a 2-wire serial bus extender designed to facilitate level shifting between 3.3 V and 5 V systems, allowing for bus extension up to 18 meters. It is particularly useful in applications involving DDC (Display Data Channel), I2C-bus, or SMBus communications. The device features bidirectional buffering for both the data (SDA) and clock (SCL) lines, ensuring reliable signal integrity over long distances. The rise time accelerator on port A enhances performance by allowing the bus to drive heavier capacitive loads.

#### Typical Applications:
- **HDMI DDC Applications**: The PCA9507 is ideal for HDMI applications where it can extend the DDC line, ensuring compliance with HDMI specifications.
- **Consumer Electronics**: Used in devices such as DVD players, set-top boxes, and LCD TVs to facilitate communication between components operating at different voltage levels.
- **Data Communication**: Suitable for interfacing multiple I2C-bus devices, allowing for star or series configurations in complex systems.
- **Signal Integrity Enhancement**: The rise time accelerator and bidirectional buffering make it suitable for applications requiring robust signal integrity over longer distances.

This component is essential for designers looking to integrate multiple I2C devices across varying voltage levels while maintaining signal integrity and compliance with industry standards.
