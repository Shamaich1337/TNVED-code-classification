With 64 logic macrocells and up to 68 inputs, it easily integrates logic from several TTL, SSI, MSI, LSI, and classic PLDs. The ATF1504AS(L) enhanced routing switch matrices increases usable gate count and the odds of successful pin-locked design modifications.\nThe ATF1504AS(L) has up to 68 bi-directional I/O pins and four dedicated input pins, depending on the type of \ndevice package selected. Each dedicated pin can also serve as a global control signal, register clock, register reset, or output enable. Each of these control signals can be selected for use individually within each macrocell.\nEach of the 64 macrocells generates a buried feedback which goes to the global bus. Each input and I/O pin \nalso feeds into the global bus. The switch matrix in each logic block then selects 40 individual signals from the global bus. Each macrocell also generates a foldback logic term which goes to a regional bus. Cascade logic between macrocells in the ATF1504AS(L) allows fast, efficient generation of complex logic functions. The ATF1504AS(L) contains four such logic chains; each capable of creating sum term logic with a fan-in of up to 40 product terms.\nThe ATF1504AS(L) macrocell, shown in Figure 1 , is flexible enough to support highly-complex logic functions \noperating at high speed. The macrocell consists of five sections: \n\uf06cProduct Terms and Product Term Select Multiplexer\n\uf06cOR/XOR/CASCADE Logic\n\uf06cFlip-flop\n\uf06cOutput Select and Enable\n\uf06cLogic Array Inputs\n 3 ATF1504AS(L) [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-0950P-CPLD-ATF1504AS(L)-Datasheet_032014Figure 1.

Block Diagram\nFigure 2-1. Block Diagram\nUnused product terms are automatically disabled by the compiler to decrease power consumption. A security \nfuse, when programmed, protects the contents of the ATF1504AS(L). Two bytes (16 bits) of User Signature are accessible to the user for purposes such as storing project name, part number, revision, or date. The User Signature is accessible regardless of the state of the security fuse.\nThe ATF1504AS(L) device is an In-System Programmable (ISP) device. It uses the industry-standard 4-pin \nJTAG interface (IEEE Std. 1149.1), and is fully-compliant with JTAG’s Boundary-scan Description Language (BSDL). ISP allows the device to be programmed without removing it from the printed circuit board. In addition to simplifying the manufacturing flow, ISP also allows design modifications to be made in the field via software.I/O (MC64)/GCLK3\nINPUT/GCLK1\nINPUT/GCLRINPUT/OE2/GCLK2GCK[0:2]\nGCLEARGlobal\nClock\nMux\nGlobal\nClock\nMuxOutput\nEnable\nSwitch\nMatrix\nOE1/INPUTLogic Block D\nLogic Block CLogic Block A\nLogic Block B\nGLOBAL\nBUS\n(INPUTS and FEEDBACKS BUS)I/O Pins\nI/O PinsGCK[0:2]\nGOE[0:5]GCLEARGCK[0:2]\nGCLEARGOE[0:5]\nSwitch\nMatrixRegional \nFoldbacks Macrocells\n1 to 16\nI/O Pins\nI/O Pins\nATF1504AS(L) [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-0950P-CPLD-ATF1504AS(L)-Datasheet_032014 63. Macrocell Sections\nTable 3-1. Macrocell Sections\nSection Description\nProduct Terms and \nSelect MuxEach ATF1504AS(L) macrocell has five product terms. Each product term receives as its possible inputs all signals from both the global bus and regional bus.\nThe Product Term Select Multiplexer (PTMUX) allocates the five product terms as needed \nto the macrocell logic gates and control signals. The PTMUX programming is determined by the design compiler, which selects the optimum macrocell configuration.\nOR/XOR/CASCADE LogicThe ATF1504AS(L) logic structure is designed to efficiently support all types of logic. Within a single macrocell, all the product terms can be routed to the OR gate, creating a 5-input \nAND/OR sum term. With the addition of the CASIN from neighboring macrocells, this can be \nexpanded to as many as 40 product terms with a little small additional delay.\nThe macrocell’s XOR gate allows efficient implementation of compare and arithmetic \nfunctions. One input to the XOR comes from the OR sum term. The other XOR input can be a product term or a fixed high-level or low-level. For combinatorial outputs, the fixed level input allows polarity selection. For registered functions, the fixed levels allow DeMorgan minimization of product terms. The XOR gate is also used to emulate T-type and JK-type flip-flops.\nFlip-flopThe ATF1504AS(L) flip-flop has very flexible data and control functions. The data input can come from either the XOR gate, from a separate product term, or directly from the I/O pin. Selecting the separate product term allows creation of a buried registered feedback within a combinatorial output macrocell. (This feature is automatically implemented by the fitter software). In addition to D, T, JK, and SR operation, the flip-flop can also be configured as a flow-through latch. In this mode, data passes through when the clock is high and is latched when the clock is low.\nThe clock itself can either be one of the Global CLK Signals (GCK[0:2]) or an individual \nproduct term. The flip-flop changes state on the clock’s rising edge. When the GCK signal is used as the clock, one of the macrocell product terms can be selected as a clock enable. When the clock enable function is active and the enable signal (product term) is low, all clock edges are ignored. The flip-flop’s Asynchronous Reset signal (AR) can either be the Global Clear (GCLEAR), a product term, or always off. AR can also be a logic OR of GCLEAR with a product term. The Asynchronous Preset (AP) can be a product term or always off.\nOutput Select and EnableThe ATF1504AS(L) macrocell output can be selected as registered or combinatorial. The buried feedback signal can be either combinatorial or registered signal regardless of whether the output is combinatorial or registered.\nThe output enable multiplexer (MOE) controls the output enable signals. Any buffer can be \npermanently enabled for simple output operation. Buffers can also be permanently disabled to allow use of the pin as an input. In this configuration all the macrocell resources are still available, including the buried feedback, expander, and CASCADE logic. The output enable for each macrocell can be selected as either of the two dedicated OE input pins as an I/O pin configured as an input, or as an individual product term.\nGlobal Bus/Switch MatrixThe global bus contains all input and I/O pin signals, as well as, the buried feedback signal from all 64 macrocells. The switch matrix in each logic block receives as its possible inputs all signals from the global bus. Under software control, up to 40 of these signals can be selected as inputs to the logic block.\nFoldback BusEach macrocell also generates a foldback product term. This signal goes to the regional bus and is available to four macrocells. The foldback is an inverse polarity of one of the macrocell’s product terms. The sixteen foldback terms in each region allow generation of high fan-in sum terms (up to sixteen product terms) with a nominal additional delay.\n 7 ATF1504AS(L) [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-0950P-CPLD-ATF1504AS(L)-Datasheet_0320144. Programmable Pin-keeper Option for Inputs and I/Os\nThe ATF1504AS(L) offers the option of programming all input and I/O pins so the pin-keeper circuits can be \nutilized. When any pin is driven high or low and then subsequently left floating, it will stay at that previous high-level or low-level. This circuitry prevents unused input and I/O lines from floating to intermediate voltage levels, which causes unnecessary power consumption and system noise. The keeper circuits eliminate the need for external pull-up resistors and eliminate their DC power consumption.\nFigure 4-1. Input Diagram\nFigure 4-2.

Speed/Power Management\nThe ATF1504AS(L) has several built-in speed and power management features. The ATF1504AS(L) contains \ncircuitry which automatically puts the device into a low-power standby mode when no logic transitions are occurring. This not only reduces power consumption during inactive periods, but also provides proportional power savings for most applications running at system speeds below 5MHz. This feature may be selected as a device option.\nTo further reduce power, each ATF1504AS(L) macrocell has a Reduced Power bit feature. This feature allows \nindividual macrocells to be configured for maximum power savings. This feature may be selected as a design option.\nAll ATF1504AS(L) have an optional power-down mode. In this mode, current drops to below 10mA. When the \npower-down option is selected, either PD1 or PD2 pins (or both) can be used to power-down the part. The power-down option is selected in the design source file. When enabled, the device goes into power-down when either PD1 or PD2 is high. In the power-down mode, all internal logic signals are latched and held, as are any enabled outputs.\nAll pin transitions are ignored until the PD pin is brought low. When the power-down feature is enabled, the PD1 or \nPD2 pin cannot be used as a logic input or output; however, the pin’s macrocell may still be used to generate buried foldback and cascade logic signals.\nAll power-down AC characteristic parameters are computed from external input or I/O pins, with Reduced Power bit \nturned on. For macrocells in reduced-power mode (Reduced Power bit turned on), the reduced-power adder, t\nRPA, \nmust be added to the AC parameters, which include the data paths tLAD, tLAC, tIC, tACL, tACH, and tSEXP.\nThe ATF1504AS(L) macrocell also has an option whereby the power can be reduced on a per macrocell basis. By \nenabling this power-down option, macrocells that are not used in an application can be turned-down, thereby reducing the overall power consumption of the device.\nEach output also has individual slew rate control. This may be used to reduce system noise by slowing down \noutputs that do not need to operate at maximum speed. Outputs default to slow switching, and may be specified as fast switching in the design file.\n6. Design Software Support\nATF1504AS(L) designs are supported by several industry-standard third-party tools. Automated fitters allow logic synthesis using a variety of high level description languages and formats.\n7. Power-up Reset\nThe ATF1504AS(L) is designed with a power-up reset, a feature critical for state machine initialization. At a point delayed slightly from V\nCC crossing VRST, all registers will be initialized, and the state of each output will \ndepend on the polarity of its buffer. However, due to the asynchronous nature of reset and uncertainty of how V\nCC actually rises in the system, the following conditions are required:\n\uf06cThe VCC rise must be monotonic,\n\uf06cAfter reset occurs, all input and feedback setup times must be met before driving the clock pin high, and,\n\uf06cThe clock must remain stable during TD.\nThe ATF1504AS(L) has two options for the hysteresis about the reset level, VRST, Small and Large. During the \nfitting process users may configure the device with the Power-up Reset hysteresis set to Large or Small. Atmel POF2JED users may select the Large option by including the flag “-power_reset” on the command line after “filename.POF”. To allow the registers to be properly reinitialized with the Large hysteresis option selected, the following condition is added:\n\uf06cIf VCC falls below 2.0V, it must shut off completely before the device is turned on again.\nWhen the Large hysteresis option is active, ICC is reduced by several hundred micro amps as well.\n 9 ATF1504AS(L) [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-0950P-CPLD-ATF1504AS(L)-Datasheet_0320148. Security Fuse Usage\nA single fuse is provided to prevent unauthorized copying of the ATF1504AS(L) fuse patterns. Once \nprogrammed, fuse verify is inhibited; however, the 16-bit User Signature remains accessible.\n9. Programming\nATF1504AS(L) devices are In-System Programmable (ISP) devices utilizing the 4-pin JTAG protocol. This capability eliminates package handling normally required for programming and facilitates rapid design iterations and field changes.\nAtmel provides ISP hardware and software to allow programming of the ATF1504AS(L) via the PC. ISP is \nperformed by using either a download cable or a comparable board tester or a simple microprocessor interface.\nTo facilitate ISP programming by the Automated Test Equipment (ATE) vendors. Serial Vector Format (SVF) \nfiles can be created by Atmel provided software utilities.\nATF1504AS(L) devices can also be programmed using standard third-party programmers. With third-party \nprogrammer, the JTAG ISP port can be disabled thereby allowing four additional I/O pins to be used for logic.\nContact your local Atmel representatives or Atmel PLD applications for details.\n10. ISP Programming Protection\nThe ATF1504AS(L) has a special feature which locks the device and prevents the inputs and I/O from driving if \nthe programming process is interrupted for any reason. The inputs and I/O default to high-Z state during such a condition. In addition, the pin-keeper option preserves the former state during device programming if this circuit were previously programmed on the device. This prevents disturbing the operation of other circuits in the system while the ATF1504AS(L) is being programmed via ISP.\nAll ATF1504AS(L) devices are initially shipped in the erased state thereby making them ready to use for ISP.Note: For more information refer to the “Designing for In-System Programmability with Atmel CPLDs” \napplication note.\nATF1504AS(L) [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-0950P-CPLD-ATF1504AS(L)-Datasheet_032014 1011.

When this mode is enabled, the \nPD pin acts as the power-down pin. When the PD pin is high, the device supply current is reduced to less than 10mA. During power-down, all output data and internal logic states are latched internally and held; therefore, all registered and combinatorial output data remain valid. Any outputs that were in a high-Z state at the onset will remain at high-Z. During power-down, all input signals except the power-down pin are blocked. Input and I/O hold latches remain active to ensure pins do not float to indeterminate levels, further reducing system power. The power-down mode feature is enabled in the logic design file or as a fitted or translated s/w option. Designs using the power-down pin may not use the PD pin as a logic array input; however, all other PD pin macrocell resources may still be used, including the buried feedback and foldback product term array inputs. \n12.3.1 Power-down AC Characteristics\nTable 12-1.

JTAG-BST/ISP Overview\nThe JTAG boundary-scan testing is controlled by the Test Access Port (TAP) controller in the ATF1504AS(L). \nThe boundary-scan technique involves the inclusion of a shift-register stage (contained in a boundary-scan cell) adjacent to each component so signals at component boundaries can be controlled and observed using scan testing principles. Each input pin and I/O pin has its own Boundary-Scan Cell (BSC) in order to support boundary scan testing. The ATF1504AS(L) does not currently include a Test Reset (TRST) input pin because the TAP controller is automatically reset at power-up. The five JTAG modes supported include:\n\uf06cSAMPLE/PRELOAD\n\uf06cEXTEST\n\uf06cBYPASS\n\uf06cIDCODE\n\uf06cHIGHZ\nThe ATF1504AS(L) ISP can fully be described using JTAG’s BSDL as described in IEEE Standard 1149.1b. \nThis allows ATF1504AS(L) programming to be described and implemented using any one of the third-party development tools supporting this standard.\nThe ATF1504AS(L) has the option of using four JTAG-standard I/O pins for boundary-scan testing (BST) and \nin-System Programming (ISP) purposes. The ATF1504AS(L) is programmable through the four JTAG pins using the IEEE standard JTAG programming protocol established by IEEE Standard 1149.1 using 5V TTL-level programming signals from the ISP interface for in-system programming. The JTAG feature is a programmable option. If JTAG (BST or ISP) is not needed, then the four JTAG control pins are available as I/O pins.\n14. JTAG Boundary-Scan Cell (BSC) Testing\nThe ATF1504AS(L) contains up to 68 I/O pins and four input pins depending on the device type and package type selected. Each input pin and I/O pin has its own BSC in order to support boundary-scan testing as described in detail by IEEE Standard 1149.1. A typical BSC consists of three capture registers or scan registers and up to two update registers. There are two types of BSCs, one for input or I/O pin and one for the macrocells. The BSCs in the device are chained together through the capture registers. Input to the capture register chain is fed in from the TDI pin while the output is directed to the TDO pin. Capture registers are used to capture active device data signals, to shift data in, and out of the device, and to load data into the update registers. Control signals are generated internally by the JTAG TAP controller. The BSC configuration for the input and I/O pins and macrocells are shown below. \nFigure 14-1. BSC Configuration for Input and I/O Pins (Except JTAG TAP Pins)\nNote: The ATF1504AS(L) has pull-up option on TMS and TDI pins.

PCI Compliance\nThe ATF1504AS(L) supports the growing need in the industry to support the new Peripheral Component \nInterconnect (PCI) interface standard in PCI-based designs and specifications. The PCI interface calls for high current drivers, which are much larger than the traditional TTL drivers. In general, PLDs and FPGAs parallel outputs to support the high current load required by the PCI interface. The ATF1504AS(L) allows this without contributing to system noise while delivering low output-to-output skew. Having a programmable high drive option is also possible without increasing output delay or pin capacitance.\nTable 15-1. PCI DC Characteristics\nNote: 1.
