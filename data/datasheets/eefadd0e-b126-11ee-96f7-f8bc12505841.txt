On -chip dynamic power control \nminimizes package power dissipation  in current mode. This is achieved by regulating the voltage on the ou tput driver from 7 .4 V \nto 29.5 V using a dc -to-dc boost con verter  optimized for minimum \non-chip power dissipation.  Each channel has a corresponding \nCHART pin so that HART signals can be coupled onto  the \ncurrent output of the AD5755- 1. \nThe device  uses a versatile 3 -wire serial interface that operates \nat clock rates of up to 30 MHz and is compatible with standard \nSPI, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, DSP , and microcontroller \ninterface standards. The interface  also features optional CRC -8 \npacket error c hecking , as well as a watchdog timer that monitors \nactivity  on the interface.  \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS  \n1.

H | Page 27 of 50 TERMINOLOGY  \nRelative Accuracy or Integral Nonlinearity (INL) \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy, or integral nonlinear ity, is a \nmeasure of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from the best fit line th rough the DAC transfer function. A typical INL vs. code \nplot is shown  in Figure 9. \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL)  \nDifferential nonlinearity (DNL) is the difference between the \nmeasured change and the ideal 1 LSB change betw een any two \nadjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB \nmaximu m ensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteed mono -\ntonic  by design. A typical DNL vs. code plot is shown  in Figure 10. \nMonotonicity  \nA DAC is monotonic if the output either increases or remains \nconstant for increasing digital input code. The  AD5755- 1 is \nmonotonic over its full operating temperature range.  \nNegative Full -Scale Error/Zero -Scale Error \nNegative full -scale error is the error in the DAC output voltage \nwhen 0x0000 (straight binary coding) is loaded to the DAC \nregister.  \nZero -Scale TC  \nThis is a measure of the change in zero -scale error with a change  in \ntemperature. Zero -scale error TC is expressed in ppm FSR/°C.  \nBipolar Zero Error  \nBipolar zero error is the deviation of the analog output from the \nideal half -scale output of 0 V when the DAC register is loaded \nwith 0x8000 (straight binary coding) . \nBipolar Zero TC Bipol ar zero TC is a measure of the change in the bipolar zero \nerror w ith a change in temperature. It is expressed in ppm FSR/°C.  \nOffset Error  \nIn voltage output mode, offset error is the deviation of the \nanalog output from the ideal quarter -scale output  when in  \nbipolar output ranges and  the DAC register is loaded with \n0x4000 (straight binary coding).  \nIn current output mode, offset error is the deviation of the \nanalog  output from the ideal zero -scale output when all DAC \nregisters are loaded with 0x0000.  \nGain Erro r \nThis is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the devia -\ntion in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from the ideal, expressed in % FSR.  \nGain TC  \nThis is a measure of the change in gain error with changes in temperature. Gain TC is expressed i n ppm FSR/°C.  Full -Scale Error \nFull- scale error is a measure of t he output error when full -scale \ncode is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the output is  full-\nscale − 1 LSB. Full- scale error is expressed in percent of full -\nscale range (% FSR).  \nFull -Scale  TC \nFull- scale TC is a measure of the change in full -scale error with \nchanges in temperature and is expressed in ppm FSR/°C.  \nTotal Unadjusted Error  \nTotal u nadjusted error (TUE) is a measure of the output error \ntaking all the various errors into account, including INL error, \noffset error, gain error , temperature, and time. TUE is expressed \nin % FSR.  \nDC Crosstalk  \nThis is the dc change in the output level of o ne DAC in \nresponse to a change in the output of another DAC. It is measured with a full -scale output change on one DAC while \nmonitoring another DAC, which is at midscale.  \nCurrent Loop Compliance Voltage  \nThe maximum voltage at the I\nOUT_x  pin for which the o utput \ncurrent  is equal to the programmed value.  \nVoltage Reference Thermal Hysteresis  \nVoltage reference thermal hysteresis is the difference in output \nvoltage measured at +25°C compared to the output voltage measured at +25°C after cycling the temperature f rom +25°C to \n−40°C to +105°C and back to +25°C. The hysteresis is expressed in ppm . \nOutput Voltage Settling Time  \nOutput voltage settling time is the amount of time it takes for the output to settle to a specified level for a full -scale input \nchange. A plot of settling time is shown in  Figure 25, Figure 51, \nand Figure 52. \nSlew Rate  \nThe slew rate of a device is a limitation in the rate of change of the output voltage. The output slewing speed of  a voltage -output  \ndigital -to-analog converter is usually limited by the slew rate of \nthe amplifier used at its output. Slew rate is measured from 10% to 90% of the output signal and is given in V/µs.  \nPower -On Glitch Energy  \nPower -on glitch energy is the imp ulse injected into the analog \noutput when the AD5755 -1 is powered -on. It is specified as the \narea of the glitch in nV -sec. See \nFigure 30 and Figure 48. \n \n \n \n \nAD5755- 1 Data Sheet \n \nRev. H | Page 28 of 50 Digital -to-Analog Glitch Impulse  \nDigital -to-analog glitch impulse is the impulse injected into the \nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes \nstate, but the output voltage remains constant. It is normally \nspecified as the ar ea of the glitch in nV -sec and is measured \nwhen the digital input code is changed by 1 LSB at the major \ncarry transition ( ~0x7FFF to 0x8000). See  Figure 27. \nGlitch Impulse Peak Amplitude  \nGlitch impulse peak amplitude is the peak amplitude of the \nimpulse injected into the analog output when the input code in \nthe DAC register changes state. It is specified as the amplitude \nof the glitch in mV and is measured when the digital input code \nis changed by 1 LSB at the major carry transition ( ~0x7FFF to \n0x8000). See Figure 27. \nDigital Feedthrough  \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into \nthe analog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the DAC \nbut is measured when the DAC output is not up dated. It is \nspecified in nV -sec and measured with a full -scale code change \non the data bus.  \nDAC -to-DAC Crosstalk  \nDAC- to-DAC crosstalk is the glitch impulse transferred to the \noutput of one DAC due to a digital code change and a  subsequent \noutput change of another DAC. This includes both digital and \nanalog crosstalk. It is measured by loading one of the DACs \nwith a full -scale code change (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa) with \nLDAC  low and monitoring the output of another DAC. The \nener gy of the glitch is expressed in nV- sec. \nPower Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)  \nPSRR indicates how the output of the DAC is affected by \nchanges in the power supply voltage.  \nReference TC  \nReference TC is a measure of the change in the reference output voltage w ith a change in temperature. It is expressed in \nppm/°C.  Line Regulation  \nLine regulation is the change in reference output voltage due to a specified change in supply voltage. It is expressed in ppm/V.  \nLoad Regulation  \nLoad regulation  is the change in refer ence output voltage due to \na specified change in load current.  It is expressed in ppm/mA.  \nDC-to-DC Converter Headroom  \nThis is the difference between the voltage required at the \ncurrent output and the voltage supplied by the dc -to-dc \nconverter.

H | Page 29 of 50 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD5755 -1 is a quad,  precision digital -to-current loop and \nvoltage output converter designed to meet the requirements of \nindustrial process control applications. It provides a high precision, fully integrated, low cost , singl e-chip solution for \ngenerating current loop and unipolar/bipolar voltage outputs. \nThe current ranges available are  0 mA to 20  mA, 0 mA to \n24 mA, and 4 mA to 20  mA. The voltage ranges available are \n0 V to 5 V, ±5  V, 0 V to 10  V, and ±10  V. The current and \nvoltage outputs are available on separate pins , and only one is \nactive at any one time. The desired output configuration is use r \nselectable via the DAC control register.  \nOn-chip dynamic power control minimizes package power \ndissipation in current mode.  \nDAC  ARCHITECTURE  \nThe DAC core architecture of the AD5755- 1 consists of two \nmatched DAC sections. A simplified circuit diagram is s hown \nin Figure 72. The  four MSBs of the 16 -bit data -word are decoded  \nto drive 15 switches, E1 to E15. Each of these switches connects  \none of 15 matched resistors to either ground or the reference \nbuffer output. The  remaining 12  bits of the data- word drive \nSwitch S0 to  Switch S11 of a 12- bit voltage mode R- 2R ladder \nnetwork.  \n12-BIT R-2R LADDER FOUR MSBs DECODED INTO\n15 EQUAL SEGMENTS2R 2R\nS0 S1 S7/S11 E1 E2 E15VOUT\n2R 2R 2R 2R 2R\n09226-069 \nFigure 72. DAC Ladder Structure   \nThe voltage output from the DAC core is either converted to a \ncurrent (see Figure 74), which is then mirrored to the suppl y rail \nso that the application simply sees a current source output , or it \nis buffered and scaled to output a soft ware selectable unipolar or \nbipolar voltage range ( see Figure 73). Both the voltage and  current \noutput s are supplied by V BOOST_x . The current and voltage are \noutput on separate pins and cannot be output simultaneously.  A channel ’s current and voltage output pins can  be tied \ntogether.  \n09226-070RANGE\nSCALING DAC\nVOUT_X  SHORT FAULT+VSENSE_x\nVOUT_x\n \nFigure 73.

Voltage -to-Current Conversion Circuitry  \nVoltage Output Amplifier  \nThe voltage output amplifier is capable of generating both \nunipolar and bipolar output voltages. It is capable of driving a \nload of 1 kΩ in parallel with 1 µF (with an external compen -\nsation capacitor) to AGND . The source and sink capabilities of \nthe output amplifier are shown  in Figure 24. The slew rate is \n1.9 V/µs with a full -scale settling time of 16 µs (10 V step).  If \nremote sensing of the load is not required , connect +V SENSE _x \ndirectly to V OUT_x . +V SENSE_x  must stay within ±3.0 V of V OUT _x  \nfor correct operation.  \nDriving Large Capacitive Loads  \nThe voltage output amplifier is capable of driving ca pacitive \nloads of up to 2  µF with the addition of a 220 pF nonpo larized \ncompensation capacitor on each channel. Take care  to choose \nan appropriate value of compensation capacitor. This capacitor, while allowing the AD5755- 1 to drive higher cap acitive  loads \nand reduce overshoot, increases  the settling time of the part \nand, therefore , affect s the bandwidth of the system. Without \nthe compensation capacitor, up to 10 nF capacitive loads can \nbe driven. See Table 5 for information on connecting compensa-\ntion capacitors.  \nReference Buffers  \nThe AD5755 -1 can operate with either an external or internal \nreference. The reference input requires a 5  V reference for \nspecified performance . This input voltage is then buffered \nbefore  it is applied to the DAC.  \nPOWER -ON STATE OF THE AD5755-1  \nOn initial power -up of the  AD5755 -1, the power -on reset \ncircuit powers up in a state that is dependent on the power -on \ncondition (POC ) pin.  \nIf POC = 0 , the voltage output and current output  channel s \npower up in t ristate mode.  \nIf POC = 1, the voltage output channel power s up with a 30 kΩ \npull-down resistor  to ground, and the current output  channel \npower s up to tri state.  \nAD5755- 1 Data Sheet \n \nRev. H | Page 30 of 50 Even though the output ranges are not enabled, the default \noutput range is 0  V to 5  V, and the clear code register is loaded \nwith all zeros. This means that if the user c lears the part after \npower -up, the output is actively driven to 0 V (i f the channel \nhas been enabled for clear) . \nAfter a device power -on, or a device reset, it is recommended to \nwait 100  μs or more before writing to the device to allow time \nfor internal ca librations to take place.  \nSERIAL INTERFACE  \nThe AD5755 -1 is controlled over a versatile 3 -wire serial \ninterface that operates  at clock rates of up to 30 MHz and is \ncompatible with SPI , QSPI, M ICROWIRE, and DSP standards. \nData coding is always straight binar y.  \nInput Shift Register  \nThe input shift register is 24  bits wide.  Data is loaded into the \ndevice MSB first as a 24 -bit word under the control of a serial \nclock input, SCLK. Data is clocked in on the falling edge of  SCLK. \nIf packet error checking, or PEC (see the Device Features  \nsection) , is enabled , an additional eight bits must be written to \nthe AD5755- 1, creating a 32 -bit serial interface.  \nThere are two ways in which the DAC ou tputs can be updated: \nindividual updating or simultaneous updating of all DACs . \nIndividual DAC Updating  \nIn this mode, LDAC  is held low while data is being clocked into \nthe DAC data register. The addressed DAC output is updated \non the rising edge of SYNC . See Table 3 and Figure 3 for timing \ninformation.  \nSimultaneous Updating of All DACs  \nIn this mode, LDAC  is held high while data is being clocked \ninto the DAC data register. Only the first wri te to each \nchannel ’s DAC data register is  valid after LDAC  is brought high. \nAny subse quent writes whil e LDAC  is still held high are  \nignored, though they are loaded into the DAC data register. All \nthe DAC outpu ts are updated by taking LDAC  low after SYNC  \nis taken high.

H | Page 32 of 50 PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE TO WRITE/ENABLE \nTHE OUTPUT CORRECTLY \nTo correctly write to and set up the part from a power-on \ncondition, use the following sequence:  \n1. Perform a hardware or software reset after initial power-on.  \n2. The dc-to-dc converter supply block must be configured. \nSet the dc-to-dc switching frequency, maximum output \nvoltage allowed, and the phase that the four dc-to-dc \nchannels clock at.  \n3. Configure the DAC control regist er on a per channel basis. \nThe output range is selected, and the dc-to-dc converter \nblock is enabled (DC_DC bit).

H | Page 34 of 50 Gain Register  \nThe 16-bit gain regist er, as shown in Tabl e 11, allows the user \nto adjust the gain of each channel in steps of 1 LSB . This is done \nby setting the DREG[2:0] bits to 010. It is possible to write the \nsame  gain code to all four DAC channels at the same tim e by \nsetting the DREG [2:0] bits to 011. The gain register coding is \nstraight binary  as shown in Table 12. The default code in the gain \nregister  is 0x FFFF. In theory , the gain can be tuned across the \nfull range of t he outpu t. In practice, the maximum recom mended \ngain trim is about 50% of programmed range to  maintain accuracy.  \nSee the Digital Offset and Gain Control section  for more \ninformation.  \nOffset Register  \nThe 16 -bit offset register , as shown in Table 13, allows the user to \nadjust the offset of each channel by −32,768 LSBs to +32,768  LSBs in steps of 1  LSB. This is done by setting the DREG[2:0] bits to \n100. It is possible to write the same offset code to all four  DAC \nchannels at the same time by setting the DREG [2:0] bits to 101 . \nThe offset register coding is straight binary  as shown in Table 14. \nThe default code in the o ffset register is 0x8000,  which result s in \nzero offset programmed to  the output.

H | Page 40 of 50 DEVICE FEATURES \nOUTPUT FAULT \nThe AD5755-1 is equipped with a FAULT  pin, an active low \nopen-drain output allowing several AD5755-1 devices to be \nconnected together to one pull-up resistor for global fault \ndetection. The FAULT  pin is forced active by any one of the \nfollowing fault scenarios: \n\uf0b7 The voltage at I OUT_x  attempts to rise above the compliance \nrange due to an open-loop circuit or insufficient power \nsupply voltage. The internal circuitry that develops the \nfault output avoids using a comparator with windowed limits because this requires an  actual output error before \nthe FAULT\n output becomes active. Instead, the signal is \ngenerated when the internal amplifier in the output stage \nhas less than approximately 1 V of remaining drive capability. \nThus, the FAULT  output activates slightly before the \ncompliance limit is reached. \n\uf0b7 A short is detected on a voltage output pin. The short-\ncircuit current is limited to 16 mA or 8 mA, which is \nprogrammable by the user. If using the AD5755-1 in \nunipolar supply mode, a short-circuit fault may be \ngenerated if the output voltage is below 50 mV. \n\uf0b7 An interface error is detected due to a PEC failure. See \nthe Packet Error Ch ecking section.  \n\uf0b7 If the core temperatur e of the AD5755-1 exceeds \napproximately 150°C. \nThe V OUT_x  fault, I OUT_x  fault, PEC error, and over TEMP bits  \nof the status register are used in conjunction with the FAULT  \noutput to inform the user whic h one of the fault conditions \ncaused the FAULT  output to be activated. \nVOLTAGE OUTPUT SHORT-CIRCUIT PROTECTION \nUnder normal operation, the voltage output sinks/sources up  \nto 12 mA and maintains specified operation. The maximum output current or short-circuit current is programmable by  \nthe user and can be set to 16 mA or 8 mA. If a short circuit is \ndetected, the FAULT\n goes low and the relevant V OUT_x  fault bit  \nin the status register is set. \nDIGITAL OFFSET AND GAIN CONTROL \nEach DAC channel has a gain (M) and offset (C) register, which \nallow trimming out of the gain and offset errors of the entire signal chain. Data from the DAC da ta register is operated on by \na digital multiplier and adder controlled by the contents of the \nM and C registers. The calibrated DAC data is then stored in the DAC input register.  \nAlthough Figure 78 indicates a multiplier and adder for each \nchannel, there is only one multip lier and one adder in the device, \nand they are shared among all four channels. This has implications for the update speed when several channels \nare updated at once (see Table 3).  \n09226-075DAC\nINPUT\nREGISTERDACDAC DATA\nREGISTER\nM\nREGISTER\nC\nREGISTER\n \nFigure 78. Digital Offset and Gain Control  \nEach time data is written to the M or C register, the output is \nnot automatically updated. Instead, the next write to the DAC \nchannel uses these M and C values to perform a new calibration and automatically updates the channel.  \nThe output data from the calibration is routed to the DAC \ninput register. This is then loaded to the DAC as described in \nthe Theory of Operation section. Both the gain register and the \noffset register have 16 bits of resolution. The correct method to \ncalibrate the gain/offset is to first calibrate out the gain and \nthen calibrate the offset. \nThe value (in decimal) that is written to the DAC input register \ncan be calculated by \n15\n16(1 )2\n2DACRegisterMCode D C\uf02b\uf03d\uf0b4 \uf02b\uf02d  (1) \nwhere: \nD is the code loaded to the DAC channel’s input register. \nM is the code in the gain register (default code = 216 – 1). \nC is the code in the offset register (default code = 215). \nSTATUS READBACK DURING A WRITE \nThe AD5755-1 has the ability to re ad back the status register \ncontents during every write sequ ence. This feature is enabled \nvia the STATREAD bit in the main control register. This allows \nthe user to continuously monit or the status register and act \nquickly in the case of a fault. \nWhen status readback during a wr ite is enabled, the contents of \nthe 16-bit status register (see Table 30) are output on the SDO pin, as shown in Figure 6.  \nThe AD5755-1 powers up with this  feature disabled. When this \nis enabled, the normal readback feature is not available, except \nfor the status register. To read back any other register, clear the \nSTATREAD bit first before follo wing the readback sequence. \nSTATREAD can be set high again after the register read. \nIf there are multiple units on the same SDO bus which have the \nSTATREAD feature enabled, ensure that each unit is provided a unique physical address (AD1 and AD0) to prevent \ncontention on the bus. \nData Sheet AD5755- 1 \n \nRev. H | Page 41 of 50 ASYNCHRONOUS CLEAR  \nCLEAR is an active high, edge -sensit ive input that allows th e \noutput to be cleared to a prepro grammed 16 -bit code. This code  is \nuser programmable via a per channel 16 -bit clear code register.  \nFor a c hannel to clear, that channel must be enabled to be cleared \nvia the CLR_EN bit in the channel ’s DAC c ontrol register. If \nthe channel is not enabled to be cleared , then the output \nremain s in its current state independent of the CLEAR pin \nlevel.  When the CLEAR signal is returned low, the relevant \noutputs remain cleared until a new value is programmed.  \nPACKET ERROR CHECKING  \nTo verify that data has been received correctly in noisy environ -\nments, the AD5755- 1 offers the option of p acket error checking \nbased on an 8 -bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC- 8). The device \ncontro lling the AD5755- 1 generates  an 8-bit frame check sequence  \nusing the polynomial  \nC(x) = x 8 + x2 + x1 + 1 \nThis is added to the end of the data -word, and 32 bits are sent  \nto the AD5755- 1 before taking SYNC  high. If the p acket error \nchecking enable bit is set high (Bit 12 in the software register), \nthe user must supply a 32- bit frame  that contains the 24 data \nbits and 8 -bit CRC. If the check is valid,  the data is written to \nthe selected register. If the error check fails, the FAULT  pin \ngoes low and the PEC error bit in the status register is set. After \nreading th e status register, FAULT  returns high (assuming there  \nare no other faults), and the PEC error bit is cleared automati-\ncally. It is not recommended to tie both AD1 and AD0 low \nbecause a short low on SDIN, that is, a command of 16 zeroes, may possibly lead to a zero -scale update for DAC A.  The PEC \ncan be used fo r both transmit and receive of data packets.  \nSDINSYNC\nSCLKUPDATE ON SYNC HIGH\nMSB\nD23LSB\nD0\n24-BIT DATA\n24-BIT DATA TRANSFER—NO ERROR CHECKING\nSDIN\nFAULTSYNC\nSCLKUPDATE  ON SYNC HIGH\nONLY IF ERROR CHECK PASSED\nFAULT PIN GOES LOW\nIF ERROR CHECK FAILSMSB\nD31LSB\nD8D7 D0\n24-BIT DATA 8-BIT CRC\n32-BIT DATA TRANSFER WITH ERROR CHECKING\n09226-180 \nFigure 79. PEC Timing  WATCHDOG T IMER  \nWhen enabled, an on -chip watchdog timer generate s an alert \nsignal if 0x19 5 has not been  written to the software register \nwithin the programmed tim eout period. This feature is useful \nto ensure that communication is not  lost between the MCU and \nthe AD5755- 1 and that  these datapath lines are working  properly  \n(that is, SDI N, SCLK , and SYNC ). If 0x195 is not received by \nthe softwar e register within the timeout period, the ALERT pin \nsignal s a fault condition. The ALERT signal is active high and \ncan be connected directly to the CLEAR pin to enable a clear in \nthe event that communication from the MCU  is lost .  \nThe watchdog timer is ena bled , and the timeout period (5  ms, \n10 ms, 100 ms, or 200 ms) is set in the main control register \n(see Table 18 and Table 19). \nOUTPUT ALERT  \nThe AD5755 -1 is equipped with a n ALERT pin. This is an \nactive high CMOS output. The AD5755- 1 also has an internal  \nwatchdog timer. When enabled, it monitor s SPI \ncommunications. If 0x195 is not received by the s oftware register \nwithin the timeout  period, the ALERT pin go es active.  \nINTERNAL REFERENCE  \nThe AD5755 -1 contains an integrated +5  V voltage reference \nwith initial accuracy of ± 5 mV max imum  and a temperature \ndrift coefficient of ±10 ppm max imum . The reference voltage  \nis buffered and extern ally available for use elsewhere within  \nthe system.  REFOUT must be connected  to REFIN to use the \ninternal reference.  \nEXTERNAL C URRENT S ETTING R ESISTOR  \nReferring to Figure 74, R SET is an internal sense resistor as part \nof th e volt age-to-current conversion circuitry. The stability of \nthe output current valu e over temperature is dependent on the \nstability of the value of RSET. As a method of improving the stability  \nof the output current over temperature, an external 15  kΩ low \ndrift resistor can be connected to the R SET_x pin of the AD5755 -1 \nto be used instead of the internal resistor , R1. The external resistor  \nis selected via the DAC c ontrol register  (see Table 20). \nTable 1 outlines the performance specifications of the AD5755- 1 \nwith both the internal R SET resistor and an external, 15 kΩ R SET \nresistor. Using an external R SET resistor  allows for improved \nperformance over the internal R SET resistor option . The external \nRSET resistor specification assumes an ideal resistor; the actual  \nperformance  depends on the absolute va lue and temperature \ncoeffi cient of the resistor used.  This directly affect s the gain  error \nof the output, and thus the total unadjusted error.  To arrive at \nthe gain /TUE  error of the output with a particular external R SET \nresistor , add the percentage absolute error of the RSET resis tor \ndirectly to the gain /TUE  error of the AD5755 -1 with the exter -\nnal R SET resistor , shown  in Table 1 (expressed in % FSR) .  \nAD5755- 1 Data Sheet \n \nRev. H | Page 42 of 50 HART  CONNECTIVITY  \nThe AD5755 -1 has four  CHART pins, one corresponding to \neach output channels. A HART signal can be coupled into these \npins. The HART signal appear s on the corresponding current \noutput, if the output is enabled . Table 31 shows the  recommended \ninput voltages for the HART signal at the CHART pin. If these voltages are used , the current output must  meet the HART \namplitude specifications. F igure 80 shows  the recommended  \ncircuit for attenuating and coupling in the HART signal.  \nTable 31.

Coupling HART Signal  \nA minimum capacitance of C1  + C2 is required to ensure that \nthe 1.2  kHz and 2.2  kHz HART frequencies are not significantly \nattenuated at the output. The recommended values are C1  = 22 nF, \nC2 = 47 nF. \nDigi tally controlling the slew rate of the output is necessary to \nmeet the analog rate of change requirements for HART.  \nIf the HART feature is not required, leave the CHART pins open circuit.  \nDIG ITAL SLEW R ATE C ONTROL  \nThe slew rate control feature of the AD5755 -1 allows the user \nto control the rate at which the output value changes. This feature is available on both the current and voltage outputs. \nWith the slew rate control feature disabled , the output value \nchange s at a rate limited by the output drive circuitry and the \nattached load. To reduce the slew rate, this can be achieved by \nenabling the slew rate control feature. With the feature enabled \nvia the SREN bit of the slew rate control register (see Table 26), \nthe output, instead of  slewing directly between two values, step s \ndigitally at a rate defined by two parameters accessible via the slew rate control register , as shown in Table 26.  \nThe parameters are SR_CLOCK and SR_STEP. SR_CLOCK  \ndefines  the rate at which the digital slew is  updated, for example,  if \nthe selected update rate is 8  kHz, the output update s every 125  µs. \nIn conjunc tion with this , SR_STEP defines by how much the \noutput va lue change s at each update. Together , both parameters \ndefine the rate of change of the output value. Table 32 and Table 33 \noutline the range of values for both the SR_CLOCK and SR_STEP parameters.  \n Table 32.

For example , \nif the CLEAR pin is asserted , the output slew s to the clear value \nat the programmed slew rate (assuming that the c lear channel is \nenabled to be cleared) . If a number of channels are enabled for \nslew , care must be taken when asserting the C LEAR pin. If one \nof the channels is slewing when CLEAR is asserted , other chan -\nnels may change directly to their clear value s not under slew \nrate control . The update clock  frequency for any given value is \nthe same for al l output  ranges . The step size , however , varies \nData Sheet AD5755- 1 \n \nRev. H | Page 43 of 50 across output ranges for a given value of step size because  the \nLSB size is  different for each output range.  \nPOWER DISSIPATION CONTROL  \nThe AD5755 -1 contains integrated dynamic power control \nusing a dc-to-dc boost converter circuit , allowing red uctions in \npower consumption from standard designs when using the part \nin current output mode.  \nIn standard current input module designs , the load resistor  \nvalues can range from typically 50 Ω  to 750 Ω . Output module \nsystems must source enough voltage to meet the compliance \nvoltage requirement across the full range of load resistor values. \nFor example, in a 4  mA to 20 mA loop when driving 20  mA, a \ncompliance voltage of >15  V is required. When driving 20  mA \ninto a 50 Ω load , only 1  V compliance is required.  \nThe AD5755 -1 circuitry senses the output voltage and regulates \nthis voltage to meet compliance requirements plus a small \nhead room voltage.  The AD5755- 1 is capable of driving up to \n24 mA thro ugh a 1  kΩ load.  \nDC-TO -DC CONVERTERS  \nThe AD5755 -1 contains four independent dc-to-dc converters. \nThese are used to provide dynamic control of the V BOOST  supply \nvoltage for each channel ( see Figure 74). Figure 81 shows the \ndiscret e components needed for the dc -to-dc circuitry , and the \nfollowing sections describe component selection and operation of this circuitry.  \nAVCCLDCDC DDCDC\nCDCDC\n4.7µFCFILTER\n0.1µFRFILTER\nCIN\nSWxVBOOST_X\n≥10µF10Ω 10µH\n09226-077 \nFigure 81.

This consume s a small amount of power  but \nreduce s the amount of r ipple on the V BOOST_x  supply.  \nDC-to-DC Converter  Operation  \nThe on- board dc-to-dc converters use a constant frequency, \npeak curr ent mode control schem e to step up an AV CC input  of \n4.5 V to 5.5  V to drive the AD5755- 1 output channel. These are \ndesigned to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) \nwith a duty cycle of <90%  typical . Discontinuous cond uction  \nmode refers to a mode of operation where the inductor current \ngoes to zero for an appr eciable percentage of the switching \ncycle. The dc -to-dc converters are nonsynchronous ; that is, \nthey requ ire an external Schottky diode.  DC-to-DC Converter Output Voltage  \nWhen a channel current output is enabled , the converter regu lates \nthe V BOOST _x supply to 7.4  V (±5%) or (IOUT × R LOAD + Headroom) , \nwhichever is greater  (see Figure 54 for a plot of headroom \nsupplied vs . output current ). In voltage output mode with the \noutput disabled, the converter regulates the V BOOST_x  supply to  \n+15 V (±5%).  In current output mode with the output disabled, \nthe converter regulates the V BOOST_x  supply to 7.4 V (±5%).  \nWithin a channel , the V OUT_x  and IOUT_x  stages share a common \nVBOOST _x supply so that the o utputs of the I OUT _x and VOUT _x stages  \ncan be tied together.  \nDC-to-DC Converter Settling Time  \nWhen in current output mode, the  settling time for a step greater \nthan ~1  V (IOUT × R LOAD) is dominated by the settling time of the \ndc-to-dc converter . The except ion to this is when the required \nvoltage at the I OUT_ x pin plus the compliance voltage is below \n7.4 V (±5%).  A typical plot of the output settling time can be \nfound in Figure 50. This plot is for a 1  kΩ load. The settling time \nfor smaller  loads is faster.  The settling tim e for current  steps  \nless than 24  mA is also faster.  \nDC-to-DC Converter VMAX Functionality  \nThe maximum V BOOST_x  voltage is set in the dc-to-dc control \nregister ( 23 V, 24.5 V, 27  V, or 29 .5 V; see Table 25). On reaching  \nthis maximum  voltage, the dc-to-dc converter is  disabled , and \nthe V BOOST_x  voltage is allowed to decay by ~0.4  V. After  the \nVBOOST_x  voltage has decayed by ~0.4 V , the dc-to-dc conv erter  \nis reenabled , and the voltage ramp s up again to V MAX, if still \nrequired. This op eration is shown in Figure 82.  \n28.628.728.828.929.029.129.229.329.429.529.6\n0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0VBOOST  VOLTAGE (V)\nTIME (ms)VMAX 0mA TO 24mA RANGE, 24mA OUTPUT\nOUTPUT UNLOADED\nDC-DCMaxV = 11 (29.5V)DC_DC BIT\n09226-183DCDCx BIT = 0DCDCx BIT = 1\nfSW = 410kHz\nTA = 25°C\n \nFigure 82.

H | Page 44 of 50 DC-to-DC Converter On-Board Switch  \nThe AD5755 -1 contains a 0.4 25 Ω internal switch. The switc h \ncurrent is monit ored on a pulse by pulse basis and  is limited to \n0.8 A peak current.  \nDC-to-DC Converter Switching Frequency and Phase  \nThe AD5755 -1 dc-to-dc converter switching frequency can be \nselected from the dc -to-dc contro l register. The phasing of t he \nchannels can also be  adjusted so that the dc -to-dc converter can \nclock on different edges ( see Table 25). For typical applications , \na 410  kHz frequency is recommended. At light loads (low  output \ncurrent and small load resistor) , the dc-to-dc converter enters a \npulse -skipping mode to minimize switching power dissipation.  \nDC-to-DC Converter Inductor Selection  \nFor typical 4  mA to 20 mA applications , a 10 µH inductor (such \nas the XAL4040 -103 from Coilcraft) , combined with a switching  \nfrequency of 410 kHz, allow s up to 24  mA to be driven into a  load \nresistance of up to 1  kΩ with an AV CC supply of 4.5  V to 5.5  V. \nIt is important to ensure that the  inductor is able to handle the \npeak  current without saturating , especially at the maximum \nambient temperature.  If the inductor enter s into saturation mode , \nit res ults in a decreas e in efficiency. The inductance value also \ndrop s during saturation and may  result in the dc -to-dc converter  \ncircuit not being able to supply the required output power.  \nDC-to-DC Converter External Schottky Selection  \nThe AD5755 -1 requires an external Schottk y for correct \noperation. Ensure  that the Schottky is rated to handle the \nmaximum reverse breakdown expected in operation and that \nthe rectifier maximum junction temperature is not exceeded. \nThe diode average current is approximately equal to the  ILOAD \ncurr ent. Diodes with larger  forward voltage drops result in a \ndecrease in efficiency.  \nDC-to-DC Converter Compensation Capacitors  \nAs the dc -to-dc converter operates in DCM , the uncompensated \ntrans fer function is essentially a single -pole transfer function. \nThe pole frequency of the transfer function is determined by \nthe output capacitance of the dc -to-dc converter, input and output  \nvoltage,  and output load. The AD5755- 1 uses an external  capacitor  \nin conjunction with an internal 150  kΩ resistor to  compensate \nthe regulator loop.  Alternatively , an external compensation  resistor \ncan be used in series with the compensation capacitor, by  setting \nthe DC -DC Comp bit in the dc -to-dc control register. In this  case, \na ~50  kΩ resistor is recommen ded. A description  of the advantages \nof this can be found in  the AI CC Supply Requirements —Slewing  \nsection. For typical applicatio ns, a 10 nF dc- to-dc compensation  \ncapacitor is recommended.  \nDC-to-DC Converter Input and Output Capac itor Selection  \nThe output capacitor a ffects ripple voltage of the dc -to-dc \nconverter and indirectly limits the maximum slew rate at which the channel outpu t current can rise. The ripple voltage is caused by \na com bination of the capacitance and  equivalent s eries resistance \n(ESR) of the capacitor. For the  AD5755- 1, a ceramic capacitor \nof 4.7  µF is recommended for typical applications.  \nLarger capacitors or paral leled capacitors improve the ripple at \nthe expense of reduced slew rate. Larger capacitors also imp act \nthe AV CC supplies current requirements while slewing (see the \nAI CC Supply Requirements —Slewing  section). This capacit ance \nat the output of the dc-to-dc converter must  be > 3 µF under all \noperating conditions.  \nThe input capacit or provide s much of the dynamic current \nrequired for the dc -to-dc converter and must  be a low ESR \ncomponent. For the  AD5755- 1, a low ESR tantalum or ceramic \ncapacitor of 10 µF is recommended for typical applications. \nCeramic capacitors must be chosen caref ully because  they can \nexhibit a large sensitivity to dc bias voltages and temperature. \nX5R or X7R dielectrics are preferred because  these capacitors \nremain stable over wider operating voltage and  temperature \nranges. Care must be taken if selecting a tantal um capacitor to \nensure a low ESR value.  \nAI CC SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS —STATIC  \nThe dc-to-dc converter is designed to supply a V BOOST _x voltage of  \nVBOOST  = IOUT × RLOAD + Headroom  (2) \nSee Figure 54 for a plot of headroom supplied vs . out put \nvoltage. This means t hat, for a fixed load and output voltage ,  \nthe dc -to-dc converter output current can be calculated by  \nthe following formula:  \nCC VBOOST OUT\nCCCCAVV I\nAV EfficiencyOut PowerAI\nBOOST××=×=η (3) \nwhere:  \nIOUT is the output current from I OUT_ x in amps.  \nηVBOOST is the efficiency at V BOOST_x  as a fraction (see Figure 56 \nand Figure 57). \nAI CC SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS —S LEWING  \nThe AI CC current requirement while slewing is greater than in \nstatic operation because  the output power increases to charge \nthe output capacitance of the dc -to-dc converter. This transient \ncurrent can be quite large (see Figure 83), although the methods \ndescribed  in the Reduci ng AI CC Current Requirements  section \ncan reduce the requirements on the AV CC supply. If not enough \nAI CC current can be provided, the AV CC voltage dr ops. Due to \nthis AV CC drop, the AI CC current required to slew increase s \nfurther. This means that the voltag e at AV CC drop s further (see \nEquation 3)  and the V BOOST _x voltage , and thus the output  voltage, \nmay never reach its intended value. Because  this AV CC voltage \nis common to all channels, this may  also affect other channels.  \nData Sheet AD5755- 1 \n \nRev.

One method is to add an external \ncompensation resistor , and the other is to use slew rate control. \nBoth of these methods can be used in conjunction.  \nA compensation resistor can be placed at the COMP DCDC_ x pin \nin series with the 10  nF compensation capacitor. A 51  kΩ exter -\nnal compensation resistor is recommended. This compensation \nincreases the slew time of the current output but ease s the AI CC \ntransient current requirements. Figure 84 shows a plot of AI CC \ncurrent for a 24 mA step through a 1  kΩ load when using a 51  kΩ \ncompensation resistor. This method ease s the current requirements  \nthrough smaller loads even further, as shown  in Figure 85. \n0412\n81624\n202832\n00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8AICC CURRENT (A)0mA TO 24mA RANGE\n1kΩ LOAD\nfSW = 410kHz\nINDUCTOR = 10µH (XAL4040-103)\nTA = 25°C\n09226-1850 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nIOUT_x  CURRENT (mA )/VBOOST_x  VOLTAGE (V)\nTIME (ms)AICC\nIOUT\nVBOOST\n \nFigure 84.

H | Page 46 of 50 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nVOLTAGE AND CURRENT O UTPUT RANGES ON \nTHE SAME TERMINAL  \nWhen using a channel of the  AD5755- 1, the current and voltage \noutput pins can be connected to tw o separate terminals or tied \ntogether and connected to a single terminal. There is no conflict \nwith tying the two output pins together because  only the voltage \noutput or the current output can be enabled at any one time. \nWhen the current output is enabled , the voltage output is  in \ntristate mo de, and when the voltage output  is enabled , the current \noutput is in tristate mode. For this operation, the POC pin must \nbe tied low and the POC bit in the main control register  set to \n0, or, if the POC  pin is tied high,  the POC bit in the main control \nregister must be set to 1 before the current output is enabled.  \nAs shown  in the Absolute Maximum Ratin gs section, the output \ntoleran ces are the same for both the voltage and current output \npins. The +V SENSE _x connections are buffered so that current \nleakage into these pins is  negligible when in current output mode.  \nCURRENT OUTPUT MODE W ITH INTERNAL R SET \nWhen using the internal R SET resistor in current output mode,  the \noutput is significantly affected by how  many other channels using \nthe internal R SET are enabled and by  the dc crosstalk from these \nchannels. The internal R SET specifications in T able 1 are for all  \nchannels enabled with the internal R SET select ed and outputting \nthe same code.  \nFor every channel enabled with the internal R SET, the offset \nerror decreases. For example, with one current output enabled \nusing the internal R SET, the offset error is 0.075% F SR. This value  \ndecreases proportionally as more  current channels are enabled; \nthe offset error is 0.056% FSR on each of two channels, 0.029% \non each of three channels, and 0.01% on each of four channels.  \nSimilarly, the dc crosstalk when using the internal  RSET is propor -\ntional to the number of current  output channels enabled with \nthe internal R SET. For example, with the measured channel at \n0x8000 and one channel going from zero to full scale, the dc crosstalk is −0.011% FSR. With two channels going from ze ro \nto full scale, it is −0.019% FSR, and with all three other channels going from zero to full  scale, it is −0.025% FSR.  \nFor the full -scale error measurement in T able 1, all channels are \nat 0xFFFF. This means that, as any channel goes to zero  scale ,  the full -scale error increase s due to the dc crosstalk. For example , \nwith the measured channel at 0xFFFF and three channels at \nzero  scale, the full- scale error is 0.025%. Similarly , if only one \nchannel is enabled in current output mode with the internal R\nSET, \nthe full -scale error is 0.025% FSR + 0.075% FSR = 0.1% FSR.  \nPRECISION  VOLTAGE REFERENCE SELECTION  \nTo achieve the optimum performance from the  AD5755- 1 over its \nfull op erating temperature range, a precision voltage reference must \nbe used. Give thought  to the se lection of a precision voltage refer -\nence. The voltage applied to  the reference inputs is used to provide  \na buffered reference for the DAC cores. Therefore, any error in the voltage reference is reflected in the outputs of the device.  \nThere are four possible sources of error to consider when choosing  \na voltage reference for high accuracy applications: initial accuracy,  \ntemperature coefficient of the output voltage, long term drift, \nand output voltage noise.  \nInitial accuracy error on the output voltage of an  external reference \ncan lead to a full -scale error in the DAC. Th erefore, to minimize \nthese errors, a reference with low initial accuracy error specification \nis preferred. Choosing a reference with an output trim adjustment,  \nsuch as the ADR425 , allows a syst em designer to trim system \nerrors out by setting the reference voltage to a voltage other than \nthe nominal. The trim adjustment can  be used at any temperature \nto trim out any error.  \nLong -term  drift is a measure of how much the reference output \nvoltage drif ts over time. A reference with a tight long -term drift \nspecification ensures that the overall solution remains relatively \nstable over its entire lifetime.  \nThe temperature coefficient of a ref erence’s output voltage  affects \nINL, DNL, and TUE. Choose a  refer ence with a tight temperature \ncoefficient specification to reduce the depende nce of the DAC \noutput voltage to ambient temperature.  \nIn high accuracy applications, which have a relatively low n oise \nbudget, reference output voltage noise must  be considered. \nChoosing a reference with as low an output noise voltage as \npractical for the system resolution required is important. \nPrecision voltage references such as the ADR435  (XFET design) \nproduce low out put noise in the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz region.  However, \nas the circuit bandwidth increases, filtering the output of the \nreference may be required to minimize the output noise.  \nTable 35.

H | Page 47 of 50 DRIVING INDUCTIVE LOADS  \nWhen driving inductive or poorly defined loads, a capacitor \nmay be required between I OUT_x  and AGND to ensure stability.  \nA 0.01 µF capacitor between I OUT_x  and AGND ensures stability \nof a load of 50 mH. The capacit ive component of the load may \ncause slower settling, although this may be masked by the set -\ntling time of the  AD5755- 1. There is no maximum capacitance \nlimit for the current output of the AD5755- 1. \nTRANSIENT VOLTAGE PROTECTION  \nThe AD5755- 1 contains ESD  protection diodes that prevent dam -\nage from normal handling. The industrial control environment \ncan, however, subject I/O circuits to much higher transients. To \nprotect the AD5755- 1 from  excessively high voltage transients, \nexternal power diodes and a surge c urrent limiting resistor (R P) \nare required, as shown in Figure 87. A typical value for R P is \n10 Ω.

Output Transient Voltage Protection  \nFurther protection can be provided using transient voltage suppressors (TVSs), also ref erred to as transorbs. These com -\nponents are available as unidirection al suppressors, which protect  \nagainst positive high voltage transients, and as bidirectional suppressors, which protect against both positive and negative \nhigh voltage transients. Transi ent voltage suppressors are avail -\nable in a wide range of standoff and  breakdown voltage ratings. \nThe TVS must  be sized with the lowest breakdown voltage \npossible while not conducting in the functional range of the \ncurrent output.  \nIt is recommended that al l field connected nodes be protected. \nThe voltage output node can be p rotected with a similar circuit, \nwhere D2 and the transorb are connected to AV\nSS. For the volt -\nage output node, the +V SENSE_x  pin must  also be protected with a \nlarge value series resista nce to the transorb, such as 5  kΩ. In \nthis way, the I OUT_x  and V OUT_x  pins can also be tied together and \nshare the same protection circuitry.  \n \n \n \n MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING  \nMicroprocessor interfacing to the AD5755- 1 is via a serial bus \nthat uses a protocol  compatible with microcontrollers and DSP \nprocessors. The communications channel is a 3 -wire minimum \ninterface consisting of a clock signal, a data signal, and a latch \nsignal. The AD5755- 1 require s a 24-bit data- word with data \nvalid on the falling edge of SCLK.  \nThe DAC output update is initiated on either the rising edge of \nLDAC  or, if LDAC  is held low, on the rising edge of SYNC . The \ncontents of the registers can be read using the readbac k function.  \nAD5755- 1-to-ADSP -BF527 Interface  \nThe AD5755- 1 can be connected directly to the SPORT interface \nof the ADSP -BF527 , an Analog Devices, Inc., Blackfin® DSP. \nFigure 88 shows how the SPORT interface can be connected to \ncontrol the AD5755- 1. \n09226-080AD5755-1\nSYNC\nSCLK\nSDIN\nLDACSPORT_TFS\nSPORT_TSCK\nSPORT_D TO\nGPIO0ADSP-BF527\n \nFigure 88. AD5755 -1-to-ADSP -BF527  SPORT Interface  \nLAYOUT GUIDELINES  \nGrounding  \nIn any circuit where accuracy is important, careful consideration \nof the power supply and ground return layout helps to ensure the rated performance. The printed circuit board on which the  \nAD5755- 1 is mounted must  be designe d so that the analog and \ndigital sections are separated and confined to certain areas of the board. If the  AD5755- 1 is in a system where multiple devices \nrequire an AGND- to-DGND connection, the connection  must  be \nmade at  one point only. The star ground point must  be \nestablished as close as possible to the device.  \nThe GNDSW\nx and ground connection for the AV CC supply are \nreferred to as PGND. PGND must  be confined to certain areas \nof the board, a nd the P GND -to-AGND connectio n must  be \nmade at one point only.  \nSupply Dec oupling \nThe AD5755 -1 must  have ample supply bypassing of 10 µF in \nparallel with 0.1 µF on each supply located as clos e to the package  \nas possible, ideally right up against the device. The 10  µF capacitors \nare the tantalum bead type. The 0.1 µF capacitor must  have low \neffective series resistance (ESR) and low effective series inductance (ESL ), such as the common ceramic t ypes, which \nprovide a low impedance path to ground at high frequencies to handle transient curr ents due to internal logic switching.  \nAD5755-1 Data Sheet\n \nRev. H | Page 48 of 50 Traces \nThe power supply lines of the AD5755-1 must use as large a \ntrace as possible to provide lo w impedance paths and reduce  \nthe effects of glitches on the power supply line. Shield fast \nswitching signals, such as clocks, with digital ground to prevent \nradiating noise to other parts of the board and never run them near the reference inputs. A ground line routed between the \nSDIN and SCLK lines helps reduce crosstalk between them (not \nrequired on a multilayer board that has a separate ground \nplane, but separating the lines helps). It is essential to minimize \nnoise on the REFIN line because it couples through to the DAC output. \nAvoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Traces on oppo-\nsite sides of the board must run at right angles to each other. \nThis reduces the effects of feedthrough on the board. A microstrip technique is by far the best but not always possible \nwith a double-sided board. In this technique, the component \nside of the board is dedicated to ground plane, whereas signal traces are placed on the solder side. \nDC-to-DC Converters \nTo achieve high efficiency, good  regulation, and stability, a \nwell-designed printed circuit board layout is required. \nFollow these guidelines when de signing printed circuit boards \n(see Figure 81):  \n\uf0b7 Keep the low ESR input capacitor, C IN, close to AV CC and \nPGND. \n\uf0b7 Keep the high current path from C IN through the inductor, \nLDCDC, to SW X and PGND as short as possible.  \n\uf0b7 Keep the high current path from C IN through L DCDC and the \nrectifier, D DCDC, to the output capacitor, C DCDC, as short as \npossible.  \n\uf0b7 Keep high current traces as short and as wide as possible. \nThe path from C IN through the inductor, L DCDC, to SW X \nand PGND must be able to handle a minimum of 1 A.  \n\uf0b7 Place the compensation componen ts as close as possible to \nCOMP DCDC_x .  \n\uf0b7 Avoid routing high impedance traces near any node \nconnected to SW x or near the inductor to prevent radiated \nnoise injection. GALVANICALLY ISOLATED INTERFACE \nIn many process control applicatio ns, it is necessary to provide \nan isolation barrier between the controller and the unit being controlled to protect and isolate the controlling circuitry from \nany hazardous common-mode voltages that may occur. The \nAnalog Devices \niCoupler® products can provide voltage isolation \nin excess of 2.5 kV. The serial loading structure of the AD5755-1 \nmakes it ideal for isolated interfaces because the number of \ninterface lines is kept to a minimum.

H | Page 49 of 50 INDUSTRIAL HART  CAPABLE ANALOG OUTPUT \nAPPLICATION—S HARED V OUT _X AND  IOUT _X PIN \nMany industrial control applications have requirements for \naccurately controlled current output signals, and the AD5755 -1 \nis ideal for such applications. Figure 90 shows the AD5755- 1 in \na circuit design for a HART -enabled output module, specifically \nfor use in an industrial control application in which both the \nvoltage output and current output are available— one at a time —on \none pin, thus reducing the number of screw connections required. There is no conflict with tying the two output pin s together \nbecause only the voltage output or the current output can be enabled at any one time.  \nThe design provides for a HART -enabled current output, with \nthe HART capability provided by the AD5700/ AD5700- 1 HART \nmodem, the industry’s lowest power and smallest footprint HART -\ncompliant IC m odem. For additional space -savings, the AD5755- 1 \noffers a 0.5% precision internal oscillator. The HART_OUT \nsignal from the AD5700 is attenuated and ac -coupled into the \nCHART x pin of the  AD5755- 1. Such a configuration results in the AD5700 HART modem output modulating the 4 mA to \n20 mA analog current without affecting the dc level of the \ncurrent. This circuit adheres to the HART physi cal layer \nspecifications as defined by the HART Communication \nFoundation.  \nFor transient overvoltage protection, a 24  V transient voltage \nsuppressor (TVS) is placed on the I\nOUT/V OUT connection. For \nadded protection, cl amping diodes are connected from the  \nIOUT _x/V OUT_x  pin to the AV DD and AV SS power supply pins. A \n5 kΩ current limiting resistor is also placed in series with the \n+V SENSE_ x input. This is to limit the current to an acceptable level \nduring a transient event. The recommended external band- pass \nfilter for the AD5700  HART modem includes a 150 kΩ  resistor, \nwhich limits current to a sufficiently low level to adhere to \nintrinsic safety requirements. In this case, the input has higher \ntransient voltage protection and, therefore, does not require \naddit ional protection circuitry , even in the most demanding \nof industrial environments.  \n \nHART_OUT\nGNDTXD\nRXD\nRTS\nCDVCC\nAD5700/AD5700-10.1µF\nADC_IPREFGND REFINRESETAVDD SW (×4) VBOOST  (×4)\nCHART AAD5755-1DVDD+15V +5V\n10kΩ0.1µF\n0.1µF0.1µF\n10µF10µF\n2.7V TO 5.5V\n1.2MΩ\n1.2MΩ150kΩ300pF\n150pF1µFMCUD1D2\nRL\n500ΩRP\nVOUTA+VSENSE_AD3\nAVSSAVSS UART\nINTERFACEAVCC\nIOUT B, C, D\nIOUT ACHART B, C, DVOUT B, C, D\nREFOUTDGNDLDACSDOSDINSCLKSYNCCLEARFAULTALERT\n47nF\nC222nF\nC15kΩ4mA TO 20mA\nCURRENT LOOP\n09226-089 \nFigure 90.
