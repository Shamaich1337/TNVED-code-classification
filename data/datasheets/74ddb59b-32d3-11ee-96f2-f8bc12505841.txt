Therefore, they \ncan also be effectively used as high speed instrumentation amps \nor for converting differential signals to single-ended signals. \nThe AD8129 is a low noise, high gain (10 or greater) version \nintended for applications over very long cables, where signal \nattenuation is significant. The AD8130 is stable at a gain of 1 and can be used for applications where lower gains are required. Both have user-adjustable gain to help compensate for losses in \nthe transmission line. The gain is set by the ratio of two resistor \nvalues. The AD8129/AD8130 have very high input impedance \non both inputs, regardless of the gain setting. \n \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8129/AD8130 are designed as receivers for the \ntransmission of high speed signals over twisted-pair cables to \nwork with the AD8131  or AD8132  drivers. Either can be used \nfor analog or digital video signals and for high speed data \ntransmission.  \n120\n110100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n10k 100k 1M 10M 100M\nFREQUENCY (Hz)CMRR (dB)\n02464-002 \nFigure 2. AD8129 CMRR vs. Frequency The AD8129/AD8130 have excelle nt common-mode rejection \n(70 dB @ 10 MHz), allowing the use of low cost, unshielded \ntwisted-pair cables without fear of corruption by external noise \nsources or crosstalk. The AD8129/AD8130 have a wide power \nsupply range from single +5 V to ±12 V , allowing wide common-mode and differential-mode voltage ranges while maintaining signal integrity. The wide common-mode voltage range enables the driver-receiver pair to operate without isolation transformers \nin many systems where the ground potential difference between \ndrive and receive locations is many volts. The AD8129/AD8130 \nhave considerable cost and performance improvements over  \nop amps and other multiamplifier receiving solutions. \nRFVOUTVIN\nRG\nVOUT =VIN[1+(R F/RG)]PD+VS\n–VS1\n8\n4\n53\n27\n6\n02464-003 \nFigure 3.

This is a stress \nrating only; functional operation of the device at these or any \nother conditions above those indicated in the operational \nsection of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect \ndevice reliability. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE \nθJA is specified for the worst-case conditions, that is, θ JA is \nspecified for the device soldered in a circuit board in still air. \nTable 5. Thermal Resistance \nPackage Type θJA Unit \n8-Lead SOIC/4-Layer 121 °C/W \n8-Lead MSOP/4-Layer 142 °C/W \n \nMaximum Power Dissipation \nThe maximum safe power dissipation in the AD8129/AD8130 \npackages is limited by the associated rise in junction temp-\nerature (T J) on the die. At approximately 150°C, which is the \nglass transition temperature, the plastic changes its properties. \nEven temporarily exceeding this temperature limit can change the stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric performance of the AD8129/AD8130. \nExceeding a junction temperature of 150°C for an extended \nperiod can result in changes in the silicon devices, potentially \ncausing failure.  The power dissipated in the package (P D) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the \npackage due to the load drive. The quiescent power is the voltage between the supply pins (V\nS) times the quiescent \ncurrent (I S). The power dissipated due to the load drive  \ndepends upon the particular application. The power due to  load drive is calculated by multiplying the load current by the associated voltage drop across the device. RMS voltages and \ncurrents must be used in these calculations. \nAirflow reduces θ JA. In addition, more metal directly in contact \nwith the package leads from metal traces through holes, ground,  \nand power planes reduces the θ JA. \nFigure 4  shows the maximum safe power dissipation in the \npackage vs. the ambient temperature for the 8-lead SOIC \n(121°C/W) and MSOP (θ JA = 142°C/W) packages on a JEDEC \nstandard 4-layer board. θ JA values are approximations. \nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)1.75\n1.50\n1.001.25\n0.50\n0.250.75\n0\n–40–30 –20 –10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110120SOIC\nMSOP\n02464-005 \nFigure 4.

Electros tatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate on \nthe human body and test equipment and can discharge wi thout detection. Although  this product features \nproprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent dama ge may occur on devices subjected to high energy \nelectrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD pr ecautions are recommended to avoid performance \ndegradation or loss of functionality.  \n \nAD8129/AD8130  \n \nRev.

C | Page 32 of 40 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8129/AD8130 use an architecture called active feedback, \nwhich differs from that of conventional op amps. The most \nobvious differentiating feature is the presence of two separate pairs of differential inputs compared with a conventional op amp’s single pair. Typically, for the active feedback architecture, one of these input pairs is driven by a differential input signal, \nwhile the other is used for the feedback. This active stage in the \nfeedback path is where the term active feedback  is derived. \nThe active feedback architecture offers several advantages over a \nconventional op amp in many types of applications. Among these \nare excellent common-mode rejection, wide input common-mode range, and a pair of inputs that are high impedance and completely balanced in a typical application. In addition, while an external \nfeedback network establishes the gain response as in a conventional \nop amp, its separate path makes it completely independent of the signal input. This eliminates any interaction between the feedback and input circuits, which traditionally causes problems \nwith CMRR in conventional differential-input op amp circuits. \nAnother advantage is the ability to change the polarity of the \ngain merely by switching the differential inputs. A high input-\nimpedance inverting amplifier can be made. Besides a high input impedance, a unity-gain inverter with the AD8130 has  \na noise gain of unity. This produces lower output noise and \nhigher bandwidth than op amps that have noise gain equal  \nto 2 for a unity-gain inverter. \nThe two differential input stages of the AD8129/AD8130 are \neach transconductance stages that are well matched. These stages \nconvert the respective differential input voltages to internal currents. The currents are then summed and converted to a voltage, which is buffered to drive the output. The compensation \ncapacitor is in the summing circuit. \nWhen the feedback path is closed around the part, the output \ndrives the feedback input to the voltage that causes the internal \ncurrents to sum to 0. This occurs when the two differential inputs are equal and opposite; that is, their algebraic sum is 0. \nIn a closed-loop application, a conventional op amp has its \ndifferential input voltage driven to near 0 under nontransient \nconditions. The AD8129/AD8130 generally has differential \ninput voltages at each of its input pairs, even under equilibrium \nconditions. As a practical consideration, it is necessary to limit \nthe differential input voltage internally with a clamp circuit. Therefore, the input dynamic ranges are limited to about  \n2.5 V for the AD8130 and 0.5 V for the AD8129 (see the \nAD8129/AD8130 Specifications  section for more detail). For \nthis and other reasons, it is not recommended to reverse the \ninput and feedback stages of the AD8129/AD8130, even though some apparently normal functi onality may be observed under \nsome conditions. A few simple circuits can illustrate how the \nactive feedback architecture of the AD8129/AD8130 operates. \nOP AMP CONFIGURATION \nIf only one of the input stages of the AD8129/AD8130 is used, it \nfunctions very much like a conventional op amp (see Figure 131 ). \nClassical inverting and noninverting op amps circuits can be \ncreated, and the basic governing equations are the same as for a conventional op amp. The unused input pins form the second \ninput and should be shorted together and tied to ground or a \nmidsupply voltage when they are not used. \n–VSPD +VS+\n+\nRF\nRG\n–VVOUT\nVIN+V\n6\n25481370.1μF 10μF\n0.1μF 10μF\n02464-132\nNOTES\n1.

With Both Inputs Grounded, the Feedback Stage Functions like \nan Op Amp: V OUT = V IN (1 + R F/RG). \nWith the unused pair of inputs shorted, there is no differential \nvoltage between them. This dictates that the differential input \nvoltage of the used inputs is also 0 for closed-loop applications. \nBecause this is the governing principle of conventional op amp circuits, an active feedback amplifier can function as a \nconventional op amp under these conditions. \nNote that this circuit is presented only for illustration purposes \nto show the similarities of the active feedback architecture \nfunctionality to conventional op amp functionality. If it is desired to design a circuit that can be created from a conven-tional op amp, it is recommended to choose a conventional  \nop amp with specifications that are better suited to that application. \nThese op amp principles are the basis for offsetting the output, \nas described in the \nOutput Offset/Level Translator  section. \n \n   AD8129/AD8130\n \nRev. C | Page 33 of 40 APPLICATIONS \nBASIC GAIN CIRCUITS \nThe gain of the AD8129/AD8130 can be set with a pair of \nfeedback resistors. The basic configuration is shown in Figure 132 . \nThe gain equation is the same as that of a conventional op amp: \nG = 1 + R F/RG. For unity-gain applications using the AD8130, \nRF can be set to 0 (short circuit), and R G can be removed (see \nFigure 133 ). The AD8129 is compensated to operate at gains of \n10 and higher; therefore, shorting the feedback path to obtain \nunity gain causes oscillation. \nRF\nRG\n–VVOUT+V\nVIN\n–VSPD +VS +\n+AD8129/\nAD8130\n6\n254813 7\n0.1μF 10μF0.1μF 10μF\n02464-133 \nFigure 132.

An AD8130 with Unity Gain \nThe input signal can be applied either differentially or in a \nsingle-ended fashion—all that matters is the magnitude of the \ndifferential signal between the two inputs. For single-ended \ninput applications, applying the signal to the +IN with −IN \ngrounded creates a noninverting gain, while reversing these connections creates an inverting gain. Because the two inputs are high impedance and matched, both of these conditions provide the same high input impedance. Thus, an advantage of \nthe active feedback architecture is the ability to make a high \ninput impedance inverting op amp. If conventional op amps are \nused, a high impedance buffer followed by an inverting stage is \nneeded. This requires two op amps. \n \n TWISTED-PAIR CABLE,  COMPOSITE VIDEO \nRECEIVER WITH EQUALIZATION USING AN AD8130 \nThe AD8130 has excellent common-mode rejection at its \ninputs. This makes it an ideal candidate for a receiver for signals \nthat are transmitted over long distances on twisted-pair cables. \nCategory 5 cables are very common in office settings and are \nextensively used for data transmission. These cables can also be \nused for the analog transmission of signals such as video. \nThese long cables pick up noise from the environment they pass \nthrough. This noise does not favor one conductor over another \nand therefore is a common-mode signal. A receiver that rejects the common-mode signal on the cable can greatly enhance the \nsignal-to-noise ratio performance of the link. \nThe AD8130 is also very easy to use as a differential receiver, \nbecause the differential inputs and the feedback inputs are \nentirely separate. This means that there is no interaction between the feedback network and the termination network,  as there would be in conventional op amp types of receivers. \nAnother issue with long cables is that there is more attenuation \nof the signal at longer distances. Attenuation is also a function \nof frequency; it increases to roughly the square root of frequency. \nFor good fidelity of video circuits, the overall frequency \nresponse of the transmission channel should be flat vs. \nfrequency. Because the cable attenuates the high frequencies, a \nfrequency-selective boost circuit can be used to undo this effect. \nThese circuits are called equalizers. \nAn equalizer uses frequency-dependent elements (Ls and Cs) to \ncreate a frequency response that is the opposite of the rest of the \nchannel’s response to create an overall flat response. There are \nmany ways to create such circuits, but a common technique is to put the frequency-selective elements in the feedback path of an op amp circuit. The AD8130 in particular makes this easier than other circuits, because, once again, the feedback path is \ncompletely independent of the input path and there is no \ninteraction. \nThe circuit in Figure 134  was developed as a receiver/equalizer \nfor transmitting composite video over 300 meters of Category 5 \ncable. This cable has an attenuation of approximately 20 dB at \n10 MHz for 300 meters. At 100 MHz, the attenuation is \napproximately 60 dB (see Figure 135 ). \n \nAD8129/AD8130  \n \nRev.

Frequency Response of Equalizer Circuit It is difficult to calculate the exact component values via strictly \nmathematical means, because the equations for the cable \nattenuation are approximate and have functions that are not simply related to the responses of RC networks. The method used in this design was to approximate the required response via graphical means from the frequency response and then \nselect components that would approximate this response. The \ncircuit was then built, measured, and finally adjusted to obtain an acceptable response—in this case, flat to 9 MHz to within \napproximately 1 dB (see \nFigure 137 ). \n20\n10\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40\n–50\n–60\n–70\n–80\nFREQUENCY (Hz)I/O RESPONSE0\n10k 100k 1M 10M 100M\n02464-138 \nFigure 137.

The Voltage Applied to Pin 4 to the Unity-Gain Output Voltage \nProduced by V IN \nIf the circuit has a gain higher than unity, the gain must be \nfactored in. If R G is connected to ground, the voltage applied to \nREF is multiplied by the gain of the circuit and appears at the output—just like a noninverting conventional op amp. This \nsituation is not always desirable; the user may want V\nOFFSET  to \nappear at the output with unity gain. \n   AD8129/AD8130\n \nRev. C | Page 35 of 40 One way to accomplish this is to drive both REF and R G with \nthe desired offset signal (see Figure 139 ). Superposition can be \nused to solve this circuit. First, break the connection between \nVOFFSET  and R G. With R G grounded, the gain from Pin 4 to V OUT \nis 1 + R F/RG. With Pin 4 grounded, the gain though R G to V OUT \nis −R F/RG. The sum of these is 1. If V REF is delivered from a low \nimpedance source, this works fine. However, if the delivered offset voltage is derived from a high impedance source, such as a voltage divider, its impedance affects the gain equation. This \nmakes the circuit more complicated because it creates an \ninteraction between the gain and offset voltage. \nVOUT =\nVIN×(1 + RF/RG)+VOFFSET\n–V+V\nVIN\nVOFFSET\n–VSPD+VS +\n+\nRFRGAD8129/\nAD8130\n6\n2548137\n0.1μF 10μF0.1μF 10μF\n02464-140 \nFigure 139. In this Circuit, V OFFSET  Appears at the Output with Unity Gain. This \nCircuit Works Well if the V OFFSET  Source Impedance Is Low. \nA way around this is to apply the offset voltage to a voltage \ndivider whose attenuation factor matches the gain of the \namplifier and then apply this voltage to the high impedance \nREF input. This circuit first divides the desired offset voltage  by the gain, and the amplifier multiplies it back up to unity (see \nFigure 140 ). \nVOUT =\nVIN×(1 + RF/RG)+VOFFSET\n–V+V\nVIN\n–VSPD +VS +\n+\nRF RGRGVOFFSETRFAD8129/\nAD8130\n6\n2548137\n0.1μF 10μF0.1μF 10μF\n02464-141 \nFigure 140. Adding an Attenuator at the Offset Input Causes It to Appear at \nthe Output with Unity Gain. \nRESISTORLESS GAIN OF 2 \nThe voltage applied to the REF input (Pin 4) can also be a high \nbandwidth signal. If a unity-gain AD8130 has both +IN and \nREF driven with the same signal, there is unity gain from V IN \nand unity gain from V REF. Thus, the circuit has a gain of 2 and \nrequires no resistors (see Figure 141 ). \n VOUT\n–V+V\nVIN\n–VSPD +VS +\n+AD8130\n6\n2548137\n0.1μF 10μF0.1μF1 0 μF\n02464-142 \nFigure 141. Gain-of-2 Conne ctions with No Resistors \nSUMMER \nA general summing circuit can be made by the previous \ntechnique. A unity-gain configured AD8130 has one signal \napplied to +IN, while the other signal is applied to REF. The \noutput is the sum of the two input signals (see Figure 142 ). \nVOUT= V1 + V2V1\nV2\n–V+V\n–VS+VS +\n+AD8130\n6\n2548137\n0.1μF 10μF0.1μF1 0 μF\n02464-143PD\n \nFigure 142. A Summing Circuit that is Noninverting  \nwith High Input Impedance \nThis circuit offers several advantages over a conventional op \namp inverting summing circuit. First, the inputs are both high \nimpedance and the circuit is noninverting. It would require \nsignificant additional circuitry to make an op amp summing \ncircuit that has high input impedance and is noninverting. \nAnother advantage is that the AD8130 circuit still preserves the \nfull bandwidth of the part. In a conventional summing circuit, \nthe noise gain is increased for each additional input, so the bandwidth response decreases accordingly. By this technique, four signals can be summed by applying them to two AD8130s \nand then summing the two outputs by a third AD8130. \nCABLE-TAP AMPLIFIER \nIt is often desirable to have a video signal drive several pieces of \nequipment. However, the cable should only be terminated once at \nits endpoint; therefore, it is not appropriate to have a termination \nat each device. A loop-through connection allows a device to tap \nthe video signal while not disturbing it by any excessive loading. \nAD8129/AD8130  \n \nRev. C | Page 36 of 40 Such a connection, also referred to as a cable-tap amplifier, can \nbe simply made with an AD8130 (see Figure 143 ). The circuit is \nconfigured with unity gain, and if no output offset is desired, \nthe REF pin is grounded. The negative differential input is \nconnected directly to the shield of the cable (or an associated \nconnector) at the point at which it wants to be tapped. \n75Ω\n75ΩVIDEO\nINVOUT\n–V+V\n–VSPD +VS +\n+AD8130\n6\n2548137\n0.1μF 10μF0.1μF1 0 μF\n02464-144 \nFigure 143. The AD8130 Can Tap the Video Signal at Any Point Along the \nCable Without Loading the Signal. \nThe center conductor connects to the positive differential input \nof the AD8130. The amplitude of the video signal at this point is \nunity, because it is between the two termination resistors. The AD8130 provides a high impedance to this signal so that the signal is not disturbed. A buffered unity-gain version of the video signal appears at the output. \nPOWER-DOWN \nThe AD8129/AD8130 have a power-down pin that can be used \nto lower the quiescent current when the amplifier is not being \nused. A logic low level on the PD pin causes the part to power \ndown. Because there is no ground pin on the AD8129/AD8130, \nthere is no logic reference to interface to standard logic levels. \nFor this reason, the reference level for the PD input is V S. If  \nthe AD8129/AD8130 are run with V S = 5 V , there is direct \ncompatibility with logic families. However, if V S is higher than \nthis, a level-shift circuit is needed to interface to conventional \nlogic levels. A simple level-shifting circuit that is compatible \nwith common logic families is presented in Figure 144 . \nAD8129/\nAD81307\n+VS+VS\n3PD1kΩ\n4.99kΩ LOW =\nPOWER-DOWN2N2222\nOR EQ\n02464-145 \nFigure 144. Circuit that Sh ifts the Logic Level When V S Is Not Equal to \nApproximately 5 V. \n \n EXTREME OPERATIN G CONDITIONS \nThe AD8129/AD8130 are designed to provide high \nperformance over a wide range of supply voltages. However, \nthere are some extremes of operating conditions that have  been observed to produce suboptimal results. One of these \nconditions occurs when the AD8130 is operated at unity gain \nwith low supply voltage—less than approximately ±4 V . \nAt unity gain, the output drives FB directly. With supplies of \n±V S less than approximately ±4 V at unity gain, the output can \ndrive FB’s voltage too close to the rail for the circuit to stay \nproperly biased. This can lead to a parasitic oscillation. \nA way to prevent this is to limit the input signal swing with \nclamp diodes. Common silicon-junction signal diodes like the \n1N4148 have a forward bias of approximately 0.7 V when about \n1 mA of current flows through them. Two series pairs of such diodes connected antiparallel across the differential inputs can be used to clamp the input signal and prevent this condition. It should be noted that the REF input can also shift the output \nsignal; therefore, this technique only works when REF is at \nground or close to it (see \nFigure 145 ). \nAD8130\nVOUT\n–V+V\n–VSPD +VS +\n+VIN\n1N4148\nVIN6\n254813 7\n0.1μF 10μF0.1μF1 0 μF\n02464-146 \nFigure 145. Clamping Diodes at the Input Limits the Input Swing Amplitude \n   AD8129/AD8130\n \nRev. C | Page 37 of 40 Another problem can occur with the AD8129 operating  \nat a supply voltage of greater than or equal to ±12 V . The \narchitecture causes the supply current to increase as the input differential voltage increases. If the AD8129 differential inputs are overdriven too far, excessive current can flow into the device \nand potentially cause permanent damage. \nA practical means to prevent this from occurring is to clamp the \ninputs differentially with a pair of antiparallel Schottky diodes \n(see Figure 146 ). These diodes have a lower forward voltage of \napproximately 0.4 V . If the differential voltage across the inputs is restricted to these conditions, no excess current is drawn by \nthe AD8129 under these operating conditions. \nIf the supply voltage is restricted to less than ±11 V , the internal \nclamping circuit limits the differential voltage and excessive \nsupply current is not drawn. The external clamp circuit is not \nneeded. \nVIN\nAGILENT\nHSMS 2822\n1 23\nVOUT\n–V+V\n–VSPD +VS +\n+ VINAD8129\n6\n254813 7\n0.1μF 10μF0.1μF1 0 μF\n02464-147 \nFigure 146. Schottky Diodes Across the Inputs  \nLimits the Input Differential Voltage \nIn both circuits, the input series resistors function to limit the \ncurrent through the diodes when they are forward biased. As a \npractical matter, these resistors must be matched so that the CMRR is preserved at high frequencies. These resistors have \nminimal effect on the CMRR at low frequency. \nPOWER DISSIPATION \nThe AD8129/AD8130 can operate with supply voltages from  \n+5 V to ±12 V . The major reason for such a wide supply range is \nto provide a wide input common-mode range for systems that \ncan require this. This would be encountered when significant \ncommon-mode noise couples into the input path. For applications that do not require a wide dynamic range for the input or output, it \nis recommended to operate with lower supply voltages. \nThe AD8129/AD8130 is also available in a very small 8-lead \nMSOP package. This package has higher thermal impedance \nthan larger packages and operates at a higher temperature with the same amount of power dissipation. Certain operating conditions that are within the specifications range of the parts can cause excess power dissipation. Caution should be exercised. The power dissipation is a function of several operating \nconditions, including the supply voltage, the input differential \nvoltage, the output load, and the signal frequency. \nA basic starting point is to calculate the quiescent power \ndissipation with no signal and no differential input voltage.  \nThis is just the product of the total supply voltage and the quiescent operating current. The maximum operating supply voltage is 26.4 V , and the quiescent current is 13 mA. This \ncauses a quiescent power dissipation of 343 mW . For the  \nMSOP package, the θ\nJA specification is 142°C/W . Therefore,  \nthe quiescent power causes about a 49°C rise above ambient  \nin the MSOP package. \nThe current consumption is also a function of the differential \ninput voltage (see Figure 113  and Figure 114 ). This current \nshould be added onto the quiescent current and then multiplied \nby the total supply voltage to calculate the power. \nThe AD8129/AD8130 can directly drive loads of as low as \n100 Ω, such as a terminated 50 Ω cable. The worst-case power \ndissipation in the output stage occurs when the output is at midsupply. As an example, for a 12 V supply with the output \ndriving a 250 Ω load to ground, the maximum power dissipation  \nin the output occurs when the output voltage is 6 V . The load current is 6 V/250 Ω = 24 mA. This same current flows through the output across a 6 V drop from V\nS. It dissipates 144 mW . For \nthe 8-lead MSOP package, this causes a temperature rise of \n20°C above ambient. Although this is a worst-case number, it is \napparent that this can be a considerable additional amount of \npower dissipation. \nSeveral changes can be made to alleviate this. One is to use the \nstandard 8-lead SOIC package. This lowers the thermal impedance \nto 121°C/W , which is a 15% improvement. Another is to use a \nlower supply voltage unless absolutely necessary. \nFinally, do not use the AD8129/AD8130 when it is operating on \nhigh supply voltages to directly drive a heavy load. It is best to \nuse a second op amp after the output stage. Some of the gain can be shifted to this stage so that the signal swing at the output \nof the AD8129/AD8130 is not too large. \nAD8129/AD8130  \n \nRev. C | Page 38 of 40 LAYOUT, GROUNDING, AND BYPASSING  \nThe AD8129/AD8130 are very high speed parts that can be \nsensitive to the PCB environment in which they operate. \nRealizing their superior specifications requires attention to \nvarious details of standard high speed PCB design practice. \nThe first requirement is for a good solid ground plane that \ncovers as much of the board area around the AD8129/AD8130 \nas possible. The only exception to this is that the ground plane around the FB pin should be kept a few millimeters away, and \nthe ground should be removed from the inner layers and the \nopposite side of the board under this pin. This minimizes the stray capacitance on this node and helps preserve the gain \nflatness vs. frequency. \nThe power supply pins should be bypassed as close as possible \nto the device to the nearby ground plane. Good high frequency \nceramic chip capacitors should be used, and the bypassing should be done with a capacitance value of 0.01 μF to 0.1 μF for each supply. Farther away, low frequency bypassing should be \nprovided with 10 μF tantalum capacitors from each supply to \nground. \nThe signal routing should be short and direct to avoid parasitic \neffects. Where possible, signals should be run over ground \nplanes to avoid radiating or to avoid being susceptible to other \nradiation sources.  \n \n   AD8129/AD8130\n \nRev.
