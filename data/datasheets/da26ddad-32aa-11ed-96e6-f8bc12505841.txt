The PEX 8717  is well suited for \nfan-out, aggregation , and peer-to-peer traffic patterns . \n \nMulti -Host Architecture  \nThe PEX 8717  employs an enhanced  version of PLX’s field tested PEX 8 716 \nPCIe switch architecture, which allows users to configure the device in legacy \nsingle -host mode or multi -host mode with up to two host ports capable of 1+1 \n(one active & one backup ) host failover. This powerful archi tectural \nenhancement enables users to build PCIe based systems to support high -\navail ability, failover, redundant, or  clustered systems.    \n \nHigh Performance & Low Packet Latency  \nThe PEX 8717  architecture supports packet cut-thru  with a maximum \nlatency of 1 38ns (x 4 to x4). This, combined with large packet memory, \nflexible common buffer/FC credit pool and non -blocking internal switch \narchitecture, provides full line rate on all ports for performance -hungry \napplications such as servers and switch fabrics . The low latency enables \napplications to achieve high throughput and performance. In addition to low \nlatency, the device supports a packet payload size of up to 20 48 bytes, \nenabling the user to achieve even higher throughput.  \n \nIntegrated DMA Engine  \nThe PEX 8717  boasts a versatile and powerful built-in DMA engine . The \nDMA engine removes the burden of having to move data between devices \naway from the processor – allowing the processor to perform computational \ntasks instead. The four DMA channels can support high d ata rate transfers \nbetween I/O devices connected to any of the switch’ s ports. Additionally, the \nDMA engine in the PEX 8717  can be used to complement the DMA engine in \nthe processor by providing additional DMA channels for higher performance.  \n \nData Integri ty \nThe PEX 8717  provides  end-to-end CRC  (ECRC) protection and Poison  bit \nsupport to enable designs that require end-to-end data integrity . PLX also \nsupports data path parity and memory (RAM) error correction  circuitry \nthroughout the internal data paths as packets pass through the switch.  \n \nFlexible Configuration  \nThe PEX 8717 ’s 10 ports can be \nconfigured to lane widths of x1, x2, x4, \nor x8. Flexible buffer allocation, along \nwith the device's flexible packet flow \ncontrol,  maximizes throughput for \napplications  where more traffic flows in \nthe downstream, rather than upstream, \ndirection.  Any port can be designated as \nthe upstream port, which can be changed \ndynamically. Figure 1 shows some of the \nPEX 8717 ’s common port configurations \nin legacy Single -Host mode . \nPEX 8717, PCI Express Gen 3  Switch, 16 Lanes, 10 Ports  \n© PLX Technology,  www.plxte ch.com  Page 2 of 5 8/1/2011 , Version 1.0 \nThe PEX 8717  can also be configured in Multi -Host mode  \nwhere users can choose up to two ports as host/upstream \nports and assign a desired number of downstream ports to \neach host. In Multi -Host mode, a virtual switch  is created \nfor each host port and its ass ociated downstream ports \ninside the device. The traffic between the ports of a virtual \nswitch is completely isolated from the traffic in other \nvirtual switches. Figure 2 illustrates some configurations \nof the PEX 8717  in Multi -Host mode where each ellipse \nrepresents a virtual switch inside the device.  \n \nThe PEX 8717  also provides \nseveral ways to configure its \nregisters. The device can be \nconfigured through strapping \npins, I2C interface , host \nsoftware, or an optional serial \nEEPROM. This allows for \neasy debu g during the \ndevelopment phase, \nperformance monitoring \nduring the operation phase, \nand driver or software \nupgrade.   \n \nDual -Host & Failover Support  \nIn Single -Host mode, the PEX 8717  supports 2 Non-\nTransparent (NT) Port s, which enables the \nimplementation of dual-host systems  for redundancy and \nhost failover \ncapability. The \nNT port allows \nsystems to \nisolate host \nmemory \ndomains by \npresenting the \nprocessor \nsubsystem as an \nendpoint rather \nthan another \nmemory system. \nBase address \nregisters are \nused to translate \naddresses; doorbell registers are used to send interrupts \nbetween the address domains; and scratchpad registers \n(accessible by both CPUs) allow inter -processor \ncommunication (see Figure 3).   \n Multi -Host & Failover Support  \nIn Multi -Host mode, PEX 8717  can be configured with up \nto two upstream host ports, each with its own dedicated \ndownstream ports. The device can be configured for 1+1 \nredundancy. The PEX 8717  allows the hosts to \ncommunicate their status to each other via special door -\nbell registers. In failov er mode, if a host fails, the host \ndesignated for failover will disable the upstream port \nattached to the failing host and program the downstream \nports of that host to its own domain. Figure 4a shows a two \nhost system in Multi -Host mode with two virtual sw itches \ninside the device and Figure 4b shows H ost 1 disabled \nafter failure and Host 2 having taken over all of H ost 1’s \nend-points.  \n \n \nHot Plug for High Availability  \nHot plug capability allows users to replace hardware \nmodules and perform maintenance witho ut powering down \nthe system. The PEX 8717  hot plug capability feature \nmakes it suitable for High Availability (HA) \napplications . Three  downstream ports include a Standard \nHot Plug Controller. If the PEX 8717  is used in an \napplication where one or more of i ts downstream ports \nconnect to PCI Express slots, each port’s Hot Plug \nController can be used to manage the hot -plug event of its \nassociated slot. Every port on the PEX 8717  is equipped \nwith a hot -plug control/status register to support hot -plug \ncapability  through external logic via the I2C interface.  \n \nSerDes Power and Signal Management  \nThe PEX 8717  provides low power capability that is fully \ncompliant with the PCIe power management specification  \nand supports software control of the SerDes outputs to \nallow optimization of power and signal strength in a \nsystem. Furthermore, t he SerDes block supports loop-back \nmodes  and advanced reporting of error conditions , \nwhich enables efficient management of the entire system.  \n  \nInteroperability  \nThe PEX 8717  is designed t o be fully compliant with the  \nPCI Express Base Specification r3 .0, and is backwards  \ncompatible to P CI Express Base Specification r2 .0, r1.1,  \nPEX 8717,  PCI Express Gen 3 Switch, 16 Lanes, 10 Ports  \n \n© PLX Technology,  www.plxtech.com  Page 3 of 5 8/1/2011 , Version 1.0 and r1.0a . Additionally, it supports auto -negotiation , lane \nreversal , and polarity reversal . Furthermore , the PEX \n8717 is tested for Microsoft Vista compliance  as well . All \nPLX switches undergo thorough interoperability testing in \nPLX’s Interoperability Lab  and compliance testing at \nthe PCI -SIG plug -fest. \nperformance PAK™ \nExclusive to PLX, performance PAK is a suite of u nique \nand innovative performance features which allows PLX’s \nGen 3 switches to be the highest performing Gen 3 \nswitches in the market today. The performance PAK \nfeatures consists of the Read Pacing, Multicast, and \nDynamic Buffer Pool.  \nRead Pacing  \nThe Read P acing feature allows users to throttle the \namount of read requests being made by downstream \ndevices. When a downstream device requests several long \nreads back -to-back, the Root Complex gets tied up in \nserving that downstream port. If that port has a narrow  link \nand is therefore slow in receiving these read packets from \nthe Root Complex, then other downstream ports may \nbecome starved – thus, impacting performance. The Read \nPacing feature enhances performances by allowing for the \nadequate servicing of all dow nstream devices.  \nMulticast  \nThe Multica st feature enables  the copying of data (packets) \nfrom one ingress port to multiple (up to 9 ) egress ports in \none transaction allow ing for higher performance in dual -\ngraphics, storage, security, and redundant applicatio ns, \namong others . Multicast relieves the CPU from having to \nconduct multiple redundant transactions, resulting in \nhigher system performance.  \nDynamic Buffer Pool  \nThe PEX 8717  employs a dynamic buffer pool for Flow \nControl (FC) management. As opposed to a st atic buffer \nscheme which assigns fixed, static buffers to each port, \nPLX’s dynamic buffer allocation scheme utilizes a \ncommon pool of FC Credits which are shared by other \nports. This shared buffer pool is fully programmable by the \nuser, so FC credits can b e allocated among the ports as \nneeded. Not only does this prevent wasted buffers and \ninappropriate buffer assignments, any unallocated buffers \nremain in the common buffer pool and can then be used \nfor faster FC credit updates.  \nvision PAK™ \nAnother PLX exclu sive, vision PAK is a deb ug diagnostics \nsuite of integrated hardware and software instruments  that users can use to help bring their systems to market faster. \nvision PAK features consist of Performance Monitoring, \nSerDes Eye Capture, Error Injection, SerDes Loopback, \nand more.  \nPerformance Monitoring  \nThe PEX 8717 ’s real time performance monitoring allows \nusers to literally “see” ingress and egress performance on \neach port as traffic passes through the switch using PLX’s \nSoftware Development Kit (SDK). The mon itoring is \ncompletely passive and therefore has no affect on overall \nsystem performance. Internal counters provide extensive \ngranularity down to traffic & packet type and even allows \nfor the filtering of traffic (i.e. count only Memory Writes).  \nSerDes Eye Capture  \nUsers can evaluate their system’s signal integrity at the \nphysical layer using the PEX 8717 ’s SerDes Eye Capture \nfeature. Using PLX’s SDK, users can view the receiver \neye of any lane on the switch. Users can then modify \nSerDes settings and see the impact on the receiver eye. \nFigure 5 shows a screenshot of the SerDes Eye Capture \nfeature in the SDK.  \n \nFigure 5. SerDes Eye Capture  \n \nPCIe Packet Generator  \nThe PEX 8717  features a full-fledged PCIe Packet \nGenerator capable of creating programmable PCIe \ntraffic running at up to Gen 3 speeds  and capable of \nsaturating a x8  link. Using PLX’s Software \nDevelopment Kit ( www.plxtech.com/sdk ), designers \ncan create custom traffic scripts for system bring -up \nand debug.  Fully integrated into the PEX 8717 , the \nPacket Generator proves to be a very convenient on -\nchip debug tool. Furthermore, the Packet Generator \ncan be used to create PCIe traffic to test and debug \nother devices in the system.  \nPEX 8717,  PCI Express Gen 3 Switch, 16 Lanes, 10 Ports  \n \n© PLX Technology,  www.plxtech.com  Page 4 of 5 8/1/2011 , Version 1.0 \nError Injection & SerDes Loopback  \nUsin g the PEX 8717 ’s Error Injection feature, users can \ninject malformed packets and/or fatal errors into their \nsystem and  evaluate a system’s ability to detec t and \nrecover from such errors . The PEX 8717  also supports \nInternal Tx, External Tx, Recovered Clock,  and Recovered \nData Loopback modes.  \nApplications  \nSuitable for host-centric  as well as peer -to-peer traffic \npatterns,  the PEX 8717  can be configured for a wide \nvariety of form factors and applications.  \nHost Centric Fan -out \nThe PEX 8717 , with its symmetric o r asymmetric lane \nconfiguration capability, allows user -specific tuning to a \nvariety of host -centric applications. Figure 6 shows a \nserver  design where, in a quad or multi processor system, \nusers can assign endpoints/slots to CPU cores to distribute \nthe sy stem load. The packets directed to different CPU  \ncores  will go to different (user assigned) PEX 8717   \nupstream ports, allowing better queuing and load balancing \ncapability for \nhigher \nperformance.  \nConversely, the  \nPEX 8717  can  \nalso be used in  \nsingle -host \nmode to simply  \nfan-out to \nendpoints.  \n \n     Figure 6. Host Centric Dual Upstream  \n \nMulti -Host Systems  \nIn multi -host mode, the PEX 8717  can be shared by up to \ntwo hosts in a \nsystem. By creating \ntwo virtual switches, \nthe PEX 8717  \nallows two hosts to \nfan-out to their \nrespective \nendpoints. This \nreduces the number                              \n                                   \nFigure 7. Multi -Host System   of switches required for fan -out, saving precious board \nspace and power consumption. In Figure 7, the PEX 8717 \nis being shared by two different servers (hosts)                    \nwith each server is running its own applications (I/Os). \nThe PEX 8717  assigns the endpoints to the appropriate \nhost and isolates them from the other hosts.  \n \nHost Failover  \nThe PEX 8717  can also be utilized in applications where \nhost failover is required. In the below application  (Figure \n8), two hosts may be active simultaneously and controlling \ntheir own domains while exchange status information \nthrough doorbell registers or I2C interfa ce. The devices can \nbe programmed to trigger fail -over if the heartbeat \ninformation is not provided. In the event of a failure, the \nsurviving device \nwill reset the \nendpoints \nconnected to the \nfailing CPU and \nenumerate them in \nits own domain \nwithout impactin g \nthe operation of \nendpoints already \nin its domain.   \n   Figure 8. Host Fail -Over  \n \nN+1 Fail -Over in Storage Systems  \nThe PEX 8717 ’s Multi -Host feature can also be used to \ndevelop storage array clusters where each host manages a \nset of storage devices indepe ndent of others  (Figure 9) . \nUsers can designate one of the hosts as the failover -host \nfor all the other hosts while actively managing its own \nendpoints. The failover -host will communicate with other \nhosts for status/heartbeat information and execute a \nfailover event if/when it gets triggered.   \n \n Figure 9.
