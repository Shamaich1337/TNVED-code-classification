Be careful because the da mage of the product is often started at the time of \nthe hand solder. 5.Repairing         Repair should not be done after the LEDs have been soldered. When repairing is unavoidable, a double-head soldering iron should be used (as below figure). It should be confirmed beforehand whether \nthe characteristics of the LEDs will or will not be damaged by repairing.\n \n \n \n        \n \nEVERLIGHT ELECTRONICS CO., LTD.
