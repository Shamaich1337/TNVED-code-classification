This device operates from asingle supply thatis\nnominally 3.3V,butthesupply canbeaslowas3Vandashigh as3.6V.The input totheSN65LVDTxx LVDS\ndrivers isaLVCMOS/LVTTL signal, and theoutput isadifferential signal complying with theLVDS standard\n(TIA/EIA-644). The input totheSN65LVDTxx LVDS receivers isadifferential signal complying with theLVDS\nStandard (TIA/EIA-644), and theoutput isa3.3-V LVCMOS/LVTTL signal. The differential output signal ofthe\nSN65LVDTxx LVDS linedrivers operates with asignal level of350mV, nominally, atacommon-mode voltage of\n1.2V.This lowdifferential output voltage results inlowelectromagnetic interference (EMI). The differential input\nsignal oftheSN65LVDTxx LVDS linereceivers operates with asignal level of350mV, nominally, atacommon-\nmode voltage of1.2V.The differential nature oftheLVDS outputs andinputs canprovide immunity tocommon-\nmode coupled signals (noise) thatthedriven/received signal may experience, along with alowEMI solution.\nThe SN65LVDTxx canbeused toextend asymmetric bidirectional interface buses. The SN65LVDT41 combines\nfour LVDS line drivers with asingle terminated LVDS line receiver inone package, and theSN65LVDT14\ncombines oneLVDS linedriver with four terminated LVDS linereceivers inonepackage. The SN65LVDTxx can\nbeused toextend asymmetric bidirectional interface buses, such asSerial peripheral interface (SPI) over LVDS,\ntoachieve long-distance andlow-cost SPIcommunication.\nThe SN65LVDTxx isprimarily used inpoint-to-point configurations, asseen inFigure 19.This configuration\nprovides aclean signaling environment forthefastedge rates oftheSN65LVDTxx andother LVDS components.\nTheSN65LVDTxx should beconnected through abalanced media, which could beastandard twisted paircable,\naparallel paircable, orsimply PCB traces toaLVDS receiver.

TI’scustomers are\nresponsible fordetermining suitability ofcomponents fortheir purposes. Customers should\nvalidate andtesttheir design implementation toconfirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN65LVDTxx devices aremulti-channel LVDS driver and receiver pairs. The functionality ofthisdevice is\nsimple yetextremely flexible, leading toitsuseindesigns ranging from testandmeasurement toLED video wall.\nThevaried class ofpotential applications share features andapplications discussed intheparagraphs below.\n9.1.1 Extending aSerial Peripheral Interface Using LVDS Signaling Over Differential Transmission\nCables\nSerial Peripheral Interface (SPI) isfound innumerous applications asthecommunication method between\nprocessor and peripheral devices using single-ended signals over short distances. However, there isincreasing\ndemand forlonger range SPIcommunication onthesame PCB orfrom board toboard. Asdistance increases,\nexternal noise, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) with single-ended SPI signals becomes anissue.\nFurthermore, increased distance limits thedata rate duetopropagation delay, andaffects thesignal quality due\ntopotential ground shift between boards. Along distance SPI communication isachievable with thehelp of\nLVDS. LVDS, asspecified bytheTIA/EIA-644-A standard, provides several benefits when compared to\nalternative long-distance signaling technologies: lowEMI, high noise immunity, lowpower consumption, and\ninexpensive interconnect cables.\nSPIoperates inamaster-slave architecture, with fourunidirectional signal lines. Themaster supplies data named\nMaster-Out-Slave-In (MOSI), aclock (SCK), andaoptional Chip Select (CS) signal tocontrol theoperation ofthe\nsystem with multiple slave devices. TheMOSI,SCLK, andCSsignals areunidirectional from themaster device to\nslave devices. The serial data from slave tomaster device isaunidirectional signal named Master-In-Slave-Out\n(MISO). Theflow ofdata canbeseen inFigure 18.\nSN65LVDT14 and SN65LVDT41 provide thenecessary LVDS drivers and receivers specifically targeted at\nimplementing along distance SPIapplication. Ituses theunidrectional links fortheMOSI, MISO, SCK, andCS\nsignals and converts thesingle-ended data intoaunidirectional LVDS links.SN65LVDT41 combines four LVDS\nlinedrivers with asingle terminated LVDS linereceiver inone package should belocated attheSPI master\ndevice.

Inalowlatency\nsystem, thedata inperipheral device should bemade available tothehost system with minimum delay. However\ninsystems with high latency, thetotal round trippropagation delay oftheSPIsystem must beless than halfthe\nSCLK period toavoid missing bits. There arethree major delay contributors inatypical system —theSPI\nperipheral, data linkdevice, andtransmission media. Both theSPIperipheral andthedata linkdevice have fixed\ndelay. The delay intransmission media, however, increases ascommunication distance increases. The\nrelationship between cable length and SPI clock frequency can beseen inFigure 22.Figure 22refers toa\nsystem where both MISO and MOSI areused, accounting forthecase ofslave-to-mater data transmission,\nincluding roundtrip delay.

This media may beshielded twisted-pair cables, twinax cables, flatribbon cables, orPCB traces. The\nnominal characteristic impedance oftheinterconnect media should bebetween 100Ωand120Ωwith avariation\nofnomore than 10% (90Ωto132Ω).Balanced cables (forexample, twisted-pair) areusually better than\nunbalanced cables (like ribbon and simple coax cables) fornoise reduction and signal quality. Balanced cables\ntend togenerate less EMI due tofield-canceling effects and also tend topick upelectromagnetic radiation a\ncommon-mode (not differential mode) noise which isrejected bythereceiver. There should notintroduce major\nimpedance discontinuities inthesystem.\n9.2.2.3 Input Fail-Safe Biasing\nExternal pullup and pulldown resistors may beused toprovide enough ofanoffset toenable aninput fail-safe\nunder open-circuit conditions. This configuration tiesthepositive LVDS input pintoVDD through apullup resistor\nandthenegative LVDS input pinistiedtoGND byapulldown resistor. The pullup andpulldown resistors should\nbeinthe5-kΩto15-kΩrange tominimize loading andwaveform distortion tothedriver.

Refer to\napplication note AN-1194 Fail-safe biasing ofLVDS interfaces (SNLA051) formore information.\n9.2.2.4 Power Decoupling Recommendations\nBypass capacitors must beused onpower pins. Use high-frequency, ceramic (surface mount isrecommended),\n0.1-μFand0.001-μFcapacitors inparallel atthepower supply pinwith thesmallest value capacitor closest tothe\ndevice supply pin.\nBypass capacitors play akeyrole inpower distribution circuitry. Specifically, they create low-impedance paths\nbetween power and ground. Atlowfrequencies, agood digital power supply offers very low-impedance paths\nbetween itsterminals. However, ashigher frequency currents propagate through power traces, thesource is\nquite often incapable ofmaintaining alow-impedance path toground. Bypass capacitors areused toaddress this\nshortcoming. Usually, large bypass capacitors (10μFto1000μF)attheboard-level doagood jobupintothe\nkHz range. Due totheir size andlength oftheir leads, they tend tohave large inductance values attheswitching\nfrequencies ofmodern digital circuitry. Tosolve thisproblem, one must resort totheuseofsmaller capacitors\n(nFtoμFrange) installed locally next totheintegrated circuit.\nMultilayer ceramic chip orsurface-mount capacitors (size 0603 or0805) minimize lead inductances ofbypass\ncapacitors inhigh-speed environments, because their lead inductance isabout 1nH.Forcomparison purposes,\natypical capacitor with leads hasalead inductance around 5nH.\nThe value ofthebypass capacitors used locally with LVDS chips can bedetermined byEquation 1and\nEquation 2according toJohnson(1)equations 8.18 to8.21. Aconservative risetime of200psandaworst-case\nchange insupply current of1Acovers thewhole range ofLVDS devices offered byTexas Instruments.

Each structure consists ofasignal line and\nreturn path with auniform cross section along itslength. Amicrostrip isasignal trace onthetop(orbottom)\nlayer, separated byadielectric layer from itsreturn path inaground orpower plane. Astripline isasignal trace\nintheinner layer, with adielectric layer inbetween aground plane above and below thesignal trace. The\ndimensions ofthestructure along with thedielectric material properties determine thecharacteristic impedance of\nthetransmission line(also called controlled-impedance transmission line).\nWhen twosignal lines areplaced close by,they form apair ofcoupled transmission lines. Figure 21shows\nexamples ofedge-coupled microstrip lines, andedge-coupled orbroad-side-coupled striplines. When excited by\ndifferential signals, thecoupled transmission lineisreferred toasadifferential pair. Thecharacteristic impedance\nofeach lineiscalled odd-mode impedance.

FR-4, oranequivalent,\nusually provides adequate performance forusewith LVDS signals. Ifriseorfalltimes ofLVCMOS/LVTTL signals\nareless than 500 ps,empirical results indicate that amaterial with adielectric constant near 3.4, such as\nRogers ™4350 orNelco N4000-13, may bedesired. Once thedesigner chooses thedielectric, there areseveral\nparameters pertaining totheboard construction thatcanaffect performance. Thefollowing setofguidelines were\ndeveloped experimentally through several designs involving LVDS devices:\n•Copper weight: 15gor1/2ozstart, plated to30gor1oz\n•Allexposed circuitry should besolder-plated (60/40) to7.62μmor0.0003 in(minimum).\n•Copper plating should be25.4μmor0.001 in(minimum) inplated-through-holes.\n•Solder mask over bare copper with solder hot-air leveling\n11.1.3 Recommended Stack Layout\nFollowing thechoice ofdielectrics anddesign specifications, thedesigner must decide how many levels tousein\nthestack. Toreduce theLVCMOS/LVTTL toLVDS crosstalk, itisgood practice tohave atleast twoseparate\nsignal planes asshown inFigure 25.\nFigure 25.Four-Layer PCB Board\nNOTE\nThe separation between layers 2and 3should be127μm(0.005 in).Bykeeping the\npower andground planes tightly coupled, theincreased capacitance acts asabypass for\ntransients.\nOne ofthemost common stack configurations isthesix-layer board, asshown inFigure 26.\nFigure 26.Six-Layer PCB Board\nInthisparticular configuration, itispossible toisolate each signal layer from thepower plane byatleast one\nground plane. Theresult isimproved signal integrity, butfabrication ismore expensive. Using the6-layer board is\npreferable, because itoffers thelayout designer more flexibility invarying thedistance between signal layers and\nreferenced planes inaddition toensuring reference toaground plane forsignal layers 1and6.\n11.1.4 Separation Between Traces\nThe separation between traces depends onseveral factors, buttheamount ofcoupling that can betolerated\nusually dictates theactual separation. Low-noise coupling requires close coupling between thedifferential pairof\nanLVDS linktobenefit from theelectromagnetic field cancellation. The traces should be100-Ωdifferential and\nthus coupled inthemanner that best fitsthisrequirement. Inaddition, differential pairs should have thesame\nelectrical length toensure thatthey arebalanced, thus minimizing problems with skew andsignal reflection.\nBoard thickness\napproximately 100 mil2 mil\nTypical 12-Layer PCB4 mil4 mil\n6 mil6 milVCC\nViaGND\nVia\nTOP signal layer + GND fill\nVDD 1 plane\nGND plane\nSignal layer Buried capacitor>\nSignal layer\nGND plane\nVDD 2 plane\nBOTTOM signal layer + GND fill Buried capacitor>GND plane\nSignal layers\nVCC plane\nt\x032 WWW\nWMinimum spacing as\ndefined by PCB vendorLVDS\nPair\nTTL/CMOS\nTraceDifferential Traces\nSingle-Ended TracesS = \n22SN65LVDT14 ,SN65LVDT41\nSLLS530C –APRIL 2002 –REVISED FEBRUARY 2019 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: SN65LVDT14 SN65LVDT41Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2002 –2019, Texas Instruments IncorporatedLayout Guidelines (continued)\nInthecase oftwoadjacent single-ended traces, oneshould usethe3-W rule, which stipulates thatthedistance\nbetween twotraces must begreater than twotimes thewidth ofasingle trace, orthree times itswidth measured\nfrom trace center totrace center. This increased separation effectively reduces thepotential forcrosstalk. The\nsame ruleshould beapplied totheseparation between adjacent LVDS differential pairs, whether thetraces are\nedge-coupled orbroad-side-coupled.\nFigure 27.3-WRule forSingle-Ended andDifferential Traces (Top View)\nExercise caution when using autorouters, because they donotalways account forallfactors affecting crosstalk\nandsignal reflection. Forinstance, itisbest toavoid sharp 90°turns toprevent discontinuities inthesignal path.\nUsing successive 45°turns tends tominimize reflections.\n11.1.5 Crosstalk andGround Bounce Minimization\nToreduce crosstalk, itisimportant toprovide areturn path tohigh-frequency currents that isasclose toits\noriginating trace aspossible. Aground plane usually achieves this. Because thereturning currents always\nchoose thepath oflowest inductance, they aremost likely toreturn directly under theoriginal trace, thus\nminimizing crosstalk. Lowering thearea ofthecurrent loop lowers thepotential forcrosstalk. Traces kept asshort\naspossible with anuninterrupted ground plane running beneath them emit the minimum amount of\nelectromagnetic field strength. Discontinuities intheground plane increase thereturn path inductance andshould\nbeavoided.\n11.1.6 Decoupling\nEach power orground lead ofahigh-speed device should beconnected tothePCB through alowinductance\npath. Forbest results, one ormore vias areused toconnect apower orground pintothenearby plane. TI\nrecommends thattheuser place aviaimmediately adjacent tothepintoavoid adding trace inductance.

They can beplaced conveniently near thecorners or\nunderneath thepackage tominimize theloop area. This extends theuseful frequency range oftheadded\ncapacitance. Small-physical-size capacitors, such as0402 oreven 0201, orX7R surface-mount capacitors\nshould beused tominimize body inductance ofcapacitors. Each bypass capacitor isconnected tothepower and\nground plane through vias tangent tothepads ofthecapacitor asshown inFigure 29(a).\nAnX7R surface-mount capacitor ofsize 0402 hasabout 0.5nHofbody inductance. Atfrequencies above 30\nMHz orso,X7R capacitors behave aslow-impedance inductors. Toextend theoperating frequency range toa\nfewhundred MHz, anarray ofdifferent capacitor values like100 pF,1nF,0.03μF,and 0.1μFarecommonly\nused inparallel. The most effective bypass capacitor canbebuilt using sandwiched layers ofpower andground\nataseparation of2to3mils. With a2-mil FR4 dielectric, there isapproximately 500pFpersquare inch ofPCB.\nRefer back toFigure 21forsome examples. Many high-speed devices provide alow-inductance GND connection\nonthebackside ofthepackage. This center dapmust beconnected toaground plane through anarray ofvias.\nThe viaarray reduces theeffective inductance toground and enhances thethermal performance ofthesmall\nSurface Mount Technology (SMT) package. Placing vias around theperimeter ofthedap connection ensures\nproper heat spreading and thelowest possible dietemperature. Placing high-performance devices onopposing\nsides ofthePCB using twoGND planes (asshown inFigure 21)creates multiple paths forheat transfer. Often\nthermal PCB issues are theresult ofone device adding heat toanother, resulting inavery high local\ntemperature. Multiple paths forheat transfer minimize thispossibility. Inmany cases theGND dap that isso\nimportant forheat dissipation makes theoptimal decoupling layout impossible toachieve duetoinsufficient pad-\nto-dap spacing asshown inFigure 29(b).When thisoccurs, placing thedecoupling capacitor onthebackside of\ntheboard keeps theextra inductance toaminimum. Itisimportant toplace theVDDviaasclose tothedevice pin\naspossible while stillallowing forsufficient solder mask coverage. Iftheviaisleftopen, solder may flow from the\npadandintotheviabarrel. This willresult inapoor solder connection.\nFigure 29.Typical Decoupling Capacitor Layouts\nAtleast twoorthree times thewidth ofanindividual trace should separate single-ended traces and differential\npairs tominimize thepotential forcrosstalk. Single-ended traces thatruninparallel forless than thewavelength\noftherise orfalltimes usually have negligible crosstalk. Increase thespacing between signal paths forlong\nparallel runs toreduce crosstalk. Boards with limited realestate canbenefit from thestaggered trace layout, as\nshown inFigure 30.\nFigure 30.Staggered Trace Layout\nThis configuration lays outalternating signal traces ondifferent layers. Thus, thehorizontal separation between\ntraces canbeless than 2or3times thewidth ofindividual traces. Toensure continuity intheground signal path,\nTIrecommends having anadjacent ground viaforevery signal via,asshown inFigure 31.Note thatvias create\nadditional capacitance.
