General description\nThe 74HC4052; 74HCT4052 is a dual single-pole quad-throw analog switch (2 × SP4T) suitable\nfor use in analog or digital 4:1 multiplexer/demultiplexer applications. Each switch features four\nindependent inputs/outputs (nY0, nY1, nY2 and nY3) and a common input/output (nZ). A digital\nenable input ( E) and two digital select inputs (S0 and S1) are common to both switches. When E\nis HIGH, the switches are turned off. Inputs include clamp diodes. This enables the use of current\nlimiting resistors to interface inputs to voltages in excess of V CC.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide analog input voltage range from -5 V to +5 V\n•CMOS low power dissipation\n•High noise immunity\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78 Class II Level B\n•Low ON resistance:\n•80 Ω (typical) at V CC - VEE = 4.5 V\n•70 Ω (typical) at V CC - VEE = 6.0 V\n•60 Ω (typical) at V CC - VEE = 9.0 V\n•Logic level translation: to enable 5 V logic to communicate with ±5 V analog signals\n•Typical ‘break before make’ built-in\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•JESD7A (2.0 V to 6.0 V)\n•Input levels:\n•For 74HC4052: CMOS level\n•For 74HCT4052: TTL level\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•CDM JESD22-C101E exceeds 1000 V\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

#### Description:
The **74HC4052D** is a dual single-pole quad-throw (2 × SP4T) analog multiplexer/demultiplexer. It is designed for use in both analog and digital applications, allowing for the selection of one of four inputs to be routed to a common output. The device features two switches, each with four independent inputs/outputs and a common input/output. The switches can be enabled or disabled via a digital enable input, and the selection of the active channel is controlled by two digital select inputs.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Analog Multiplexing/Demultiplexing:** Used in applications where multiple analog signals need to be routed to a single output or vice versa.
- **Digital Multiplexing/Demultiplexing:** Suitable for digital signal routing in communication systems.
- **Signal Gating:** Can be used to control the flow of signals in various electronic circuits.
- **Level Translation:** Facilitates communication between different voltage levels, such as interfacing 5 V logic with ±5 V analog signals.

This component is widely used in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and industrial applications where signal routing and switching are required.
