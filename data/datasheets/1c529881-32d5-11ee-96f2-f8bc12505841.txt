A –5–OPERATION\nThe AD8522 is a complete ready-to-use dual 12-bit digital-to-\nanalog converter. Only one +5 V power supply is necessary foroperation. It contains two voltage-switched, 12-bit, laser-\ntrimmed digital-to-analog converters, a curvature-corrected\nbandgap reference, rail-to-rail output op amps, input registers,and DAC registers. The serial data interface consists of a serial\ndata input (SDI), clock (CLK), and two load strobe pins (\nLDA ,\nLDB ) with an active low CS strobe. In addition, an asynchro-\nnous RS pin will set all DAC register bits to zero causing the\nVOUT to become zero volts, or to midscale for trimming applica-\ntions when the MSB pin is programmed to Logic 1. This func-tion is useful for power on reset or system failure recovery to a\nknown state.\nD/A CONVERTER SECTION\nThe internal DAC is a 12-bit voltage-mode device with an out-\nput that swings from AGND potential to the 2.5 V internalbandgap voltage. It uses a laser-trimmed R-2R ladder which is\nswitched by N channel MOSFETs. The output voltage of the\nDAC has a constant resistance independent of digital inputcode. The DAC output is internally connected to the rail-to-rail\noutput op amp.\nAMPLIFIER SECTION\nThe internal DAC’s output is buffered by a low power con-\nsumption precision amplifier. This low power amplifier containsa differential PNP pair input stage that provides low offset volt-\nage and low noise, as well as the ability to amplify the zero-scale\nDAC output voltages. The rail-to-rail amplifier is configured ina gain of 1.638 (= 4.095 V/2.5 V) in order to set the 4.095 V\nfull-scale output (1 mV/LSB). See Figure 4 for an equivalent\ncircuit schematic of the analog section.\nBUFFER2R\n2R\n2R\n2RR\nR\nSPDT\nN CH FET\nSWITCHES2RR2\nR1RAIL-TO-RAIL\nOUTPUT\nAMPLIFIER\nVOUTBANDGAP\nREFERENCE\nVREF\n2.5VVOLTAGE SWITCHED 12-BIT\nR-2R D/A CONVERTER\nAV = 4.096/2.5\n      = 1.638V/V\nFigure 4. Equivalent AD8522 Schematic of Analog Portion\nThe op amp has a 16 µs typical settling time to 0.01%. There\nare slight differences in settling time for negative slewing signalsversus positive. See the oscilloscope photos in the “Typical Per-\nformance Characteristics” section of this data sheet.\nOUTPUT SECTION\nThe rail-to-rail output stage of this amplifier has been designed\nto provide precision performance while operating near eitherpower supply. Figure 5 shows an equivalent output schematic of\nthe rail-to-rail amplifier with its N channel pull-down FETs that\nwill pull an output load directly to GND. The output sourcingcurrent is provided by a P channel pull-up device that can sup-\nply GND terminated loads, especially important at the –10%\nsupply tolerance value of 4.5 V.P-CH\nN-CHVDD\nVOUT\nAGND\nFigure 5. Equivalent Analog Output Circuit\nFigures 6 and 7 in the typical performance characteristics sec-tion provide information on output swing performance nearground and full scale as a function of load. In addition to resis-\ntive load driving capability the amplifier has also been carefully\ndesigned and characterized for up to 500 pF capacitive loaddriving capability.\nREFERENCE SECTION\nThe internal 2.5 V curvature-corrected bandgap voltage refer-\nence is laser trimmed for both initial accuracy and low tempera-\nture coefficient. The voltage generated by the reference isavailable at the V\nREF pin. Since V REF is not intended to drive\nheavy external loads, it must be buffered. The equivalent emit-\nter follower output circuit of the V REF pin is shown in Figure 4.\nBypassing the V REF pin will improve noise performance; how-\never, bypassing is not required for proper operation. Figure 10\nshows broad band noise performance.\nPOWER SUPPLY\nThe very low power consumption of the AD8522 is a direct\nresult of a circuit design optimizing use of a CBCMOS process.By using the low power characteristics of the CMOS for the\nlogic, and the low noise, tight matching of the complementary\nbipolar transistors good analog accuracy is achieved.\nFor power consumption sensitive applications it is important to\nnote that the internal power consumption of the AD8522 is\nstrongly dependent on the actual in\nput voltage levels present on\nthe SDI, CLK, CS, MSB, LDA , LDB  and RS pins. Since these in-\nputs are standard CMOS logic structures, they contribute staticpower dissipation dependent on the actual driving logic V\nOH and\nVOL voltage levels. Consequently for optimum dissipation use of\nCMOS logic versus TTL provides minimal dissipation in the staticstate. A V\nINL = 0 V on the logic input pins provides the lowest\nstandby dissipation of 1 mA with a +5 V power supply.\nAs with any analog system, it is recommended that the AD8522\npower supply be bypassed on the same PC card that containsthe chip. Figure 12 shows the power supply rejection versus fre-\nquency performance. This should be taken into account when\nusing higher frequency switched-mode power supplies withripple frequencies of 100 kHz and higher.\nOne advantage of the rail-to-rail output amplifiers used in the\nAD8522 is the wide range of usable supply voltage. The part is\nfully specified and tested over temperature for operation from+4.5 V to +5.5 V.  If reduced linearity and source current capa-\nbility near full scale can be tolerated, operation of the AD8522\nAD8522\ninput register and transferring the 12 bits of data into the de-\ncoded address determined by the address bits A and B in the se-rial input register.\nUnipolar Output Operation\nThis is the basic mode of operation for the AD8522.  TheAD8522 has been designed to drive loads as low as 820 Ω in\nparallel with 500 pF.  The code table for this operation is shown\nin Table III.\nTable III.

The DAC regis-\nters are updated by the Load Enable ( LDA  and LDB ) pins.\nThe AD8522 offers two modes of data loading. The first mode,\nhardware-load, directs the data currently clocked into the serial\nshift register into either the DAC A or the DAC B register or\nboth depending on the external active low strobing of the LDA\nor LDB  pin. Serial data register bit Sf/ Hd must be low for this\nmode to be in effect.\nThe second mode of operation is software-load which is de-\nsigned to minimize  the number of control lines connected tothe AD8522. In this mode of operation the \nLDA  and LDB  pins\nact as one control input taking the present contents of the serial\n–6– REV. A\nAD8522\nREV.
