digital-to-analog (D/A) and from analog-to-digital\n(A/D) using oversampling sigma-delta technology. It allows 2-to-1 MUX inputs with built-in antialiasing filter andamplification for general-purpose applications such as telephone hybrid interface, electret microphone preamp, etc.Both IN and AUX inputs accept normal analog signals. This device consists of a pair of 16-bit synchronous serialconversion paths (one for each direction), and includes an interpolation filter before the DAC and a decimation filterafter the ADC. The FIR filters can be bypassed to offer flexibility and power savings. Other overhead functions provideon-chip include timing (programmable sample rate, continuous data transfer, and FIR bypass) and control(programmable-gain amplifier, communication protocol, etc.). The sigma-delta architecture produces high-resolutionanalog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion at low system cost.\nThe TLV320AIC10 design enhances communication with the DSP. The continuous data transfer mode fully supports\nTI’s DSP autobuffering (ABU) to reduce DSP interrupt service overhead. The automatic cascading detection (ACD)\nmakes cascade programming simple and supports a cascade operation of one master and up to seven slaves. Thedirect-configuration mode for host interface uses a single-wire serial port to directly program internal registers withoutinterference from the data conversion serial port, or without resetting the entire device. The event monitor modeallows the DSP to monitor external events like phone off-hook ring detection.\nIn the lower-power mode, the TLV320AIC10 converts data at a sampling rate of 8 KSPS consuming only 39 mW.The programmable functions of this device are configured through a serial interface that can be gluelessly interfaced\nto any DSP that accepts 4-wire serial communications, such as the TMS320Cxx. The options include software reset,device power-down, separate control for ADC and DAC turnoff, communications protocol, signal-sampling rate, gaincontrol, and system-test modes, as outlined in Appendix A.\nThe TLV320AIC10 is particularly suitable for a variety of applications in hands-free car kits, VOIP, cable modem,\nspeech, and the telephony area including low-bit rate, high-quality compression, speech enhancement, recognition,and synthesis. Its low-group delay characteristic makes it suitable for single or multichannel active-controlapplications.\nThe TLV320AIC10 is characterized for commercial operation from 0 °C to 70°C, and industrial operation from –40°C\nto 85°C.\n1.1 Features\n•C54xx software driver available\n•16-bit oversampling sigma-delta A/D converter\n•16-bit oversampling sigma-delta D/A converter\n•Maximum output conversion rate:\n–22 ksps with on-chip FIR filter\n–88 ksps with FIR bypassed\n•Voiceband bandwidth in FIR-bypassed mode and final sampling rate at 8 ksps\n–90-dB SNR/ADC and 87-dB SNR/DAC with DSPs FIR (FIR bypassed at 88 ksps/5 V)\n–87-dB SNR/ADC and 85-dB SNR/DAC with DSPs FIR (FIR bypassed at 88 ksps/3.3 V)\n•On-chip FIR produced 84-dB SNR for ADC and 85-dB SNR for DAC over 11-kHz BW\n•Built-in functions including PGA, antialiasing analog filter, and operational amplifiers for general-purpose\ninterface (such as MIC interface and hybrid interface)\n1–2•Glueless serial port interface to DSPs (TI TMS320Cxx, SPI, or standard DSPs)\n•Automatic cascading detection (ACD) makes cascade programming simple and allows up to 8 devices to\nbe connected in cascade.\n•On-fly reconfiguration modes include secondary-communication mode and direct-configuration mode (host\ninterface).\n•Continuous data-transfer mode for use with autobuffering (ABU) to reduce DSP interrupt service overhead\n•Event-monitor mode provides external-event control, such as RING/OFF-HOOK detection\n•Programmable ADC and DAC conversion rate\n•Programmable input and output gain control\n•Separate software control for ADC and DAC power-down\n•Analog (3-V to 5.5-V) supply operation\n•Digital (3-V to 5.5-V) supply operation\n•Power dissipation (P D) of 39 mWrms typical for 8-ksps at 3.3 V\n•Hardware power-down mode to 0.5 mW\n•Internal and external reference voltage (V ref)\n•Differential and single-ended analog input/output\n•2s-complement data format\n•Test mode, which includes digital loopback and analog loopback\n•600-ohm output driver\n1–31.2 Functional Block Diagram\nSigma–\nDelta\nADCSinc\nFilter\nLow\nPass\nFilterSigma–\nDelta\nDACADREFP\nADREFM\nMCLKInterface\nCircuit\nDiv\n256xNDIN\nM/S\nFSD\nFS\nSCLK\nM0\nM1OUTP\nOUTMPGA\nPGADOUT\nInternal Clock CircuitFIR\nFilter\nAnalog\nLoopbackDecimation Filter\nAnti–\nAliasing\nFilter\nVMID\n@ 5 mAV\nALTIFLAG\nFCDCSIDAREFP\nDAREFMMUXAURXMAURXFP\nINMINPAURXCP\n1.5 V\nor\n2.5VDTXOP\nDTXIMReceiver or MIC Amp\nTransmitter Amp\nDTXIP\nDTXOM+\n–\n+–\n–+A3\nA4A2A1\nSinc\nFilterFIR\nFilterInterpolation FilterDigital\nLoopbackSW4SW5\nSW6\nSW2 SW3\nSW1Note: Switches SWx are Controlled by Bit D6 of Control Register 1.\nref\n1–41.3 Terminal Assignments\n14 15NC\nNCAV\nDD2\nAVSS\nNC\nNC\nDVDD2\nDVSS\nNCM/S\nALTINDCSI36\n3534\n33\n3231302928272625\n161\n2\n34\n5\n6\n7\n89\n10\n1112AURXFP\nAURXM\nAURXCP\nDTXOP\nDTXOM\nDTXIP\nDTXIM\nOUTP\nOUTM\nM0\nM1\nPWRDWN\n17 18 19 20\nFILT\n4746454443 48 42INM\nINP\nAV\nAV\nNC\nFS\nFLAG\nFCDV      \nDIN\nNC\nSCLK\nMCLK\nFSD403938 41\n2122232437\n13\nNCVMIDDV     RESET\nDOUTPFB PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)SS\nDD1\nDD1SS\nSSAV\nNC\nSSAV\nNC\nNOTE: All NC pins should be left unconnected.\n1–51.3 Terminal Assignments (Continued)\n98765\nA\nB\nC\nD\nEF321\nG\nH\nJ4\nALTINMCLKPWRDWN\nFSD\nFLAGAVSS\nAVDD2AVSS\nAVDD1FILT\nAURXFP\nAURXM\nAVSSVMIDRESET\nDINDVDD2INP\nDVDD1DTXIMAURXCP\nDTXOM\nM0OUTPNC\nNC\nNC\nNC\nNC\nNC\nNCNC NCNC NCNC NCNC NCNC NC NC\nNCNC\nNC\nNC NC\nNC NC\nNC NCDTXOP\nDTXIP\nOUTM\nM1\nNC\nDVSS\nDOUT\nSCLK\nFS\nFCDCSIM/SNCDVSSNCNC\nNC NCNCAVSSAVSSINM\nNC\nNC NCNCNCNCGQE PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\nNOTE: All NC pins should be left unconnected.NC\n1.4 Ordering Information\nTPACKAGES\nTA48-PIN TQFP PFB 80-PIN MicroStar Junior GQE\n0°C to 70°C TLV320AIC10C TLV320AIC10CGQE\n–40°C to 85°C TLV320AIC10I TLV320AIC10IGQE\n1–61.5 Terminal Functions\nTERMINALS\nI/O\nNAMENO.I/O\nDESCRIPTIONNAMEPFB GQE I/ODESCRIPTION\nALTIN 26 G9 ISerial input in the event monitor  mode.

SCLK signal clocks serial data into DIN and out of DOUT during the frame-sync interval.When configured as an output (M/S\n high), SCLK is generated internally by multiplying the frame-sync\nsignal frequency by 256 (cascade devices < 5) or 512 (cascade devices > 4). When configured as an\ninput (M/S low), SCLK is generated externally and must be synchronous with the master clock andframe sync.\nVMID 43 A4OReference voltage output at AVDD/2\n1.6 Definitions and Terminology\nData transfer interval The time during which data is transferred from DOUT to DIN. The interval is 16 shift clocks\nand the data transfer is initiated by the falling edge of the FS signal.\nSignal data This refers to the input signal and all of the converted representations through the ADC\nchannel, and the signal through the DAC channel to the analog output. This is in contrastwith the purely-digital software control data.\nPrimary \ncommunicationPrimary communication refers to the digital data-transfer interval.

Addressing register 0 allows secondary-communication request without altering any\nother registers.\nRegister 1 Control register 1. The data in this register has the following functions:\n•Produce the output flag to indicate a decimator FIR filter overflow (read cycle only)\n•Enable of general-purpose operational amplifiers A1, A3, and A4\n•Enable/bypass ADCs analog antialiasing filter\n•Select normal or auxiliary analog input\n•Control 16-bit or (15+1)-bit mode of DAC operation\n•Activate software reset\n•Enable/bypass the decimator FIR filter\n•Enable/bypass the interpolator FIR filter\nRegister 2 Control register 2.

The data in this register has the following functions:\n•Control of the 4-bit gain of input PGA\n•Control of the 4-bit gain of output PGA\n2–12 Functional Description\n2.1 Device Functions\n2.1.1 Operating Frequencies\nThe sampling frequency represented by the frequency of the primary communication is derived from the master clock\n(MCLK) input with the following equation:\nFs = Sampling (conversion) frequency  = MCLK/(256 × N), N = 1, 2..., 32\nThe inverse of the sampling frequency is the time between the falling edges of two successive primary frame-sync\nsignals. This time is the conversion period. For example, to set the conversion rate to 8 kHz, MCLK = 256 × N × 8000.\nNOTE:The value of N is defined in control register 2 and its power-up value is 32.\n2.1.2 ADC Signal Channel\nBoth IN (INP, INM) and AUX (AURXFP, AURXM) inputs can use the built-in antialiasing filter that can be bypassed\nby writing a 1 to bit D5 of control register 1. The AUX input can also be connected to the general-purpose amplifier\nA1 for general-purpose applications, such as electret-microphone interface and 2-to-4-wire hybrid interface, bywriting a 1 to bit D6 of control register 1. Bit D4 of control register 1 selects between IN or AUX for the ADC. The\nselected input signal is amplified by the PGA and applied to the ADC input. The ADC converts the signal intodiscrete-output digital words in 2s-complement data format, corresponding to the analog-signal value at samplingtime. These 16-bit (or 15-bit) digital words, representing sampled values of the analog input signal after PGA, areclocked out of the serial port (DOUT) at the positive edge of SCLK during the frame-sync (FS) interval at the rate ofone bit for each SCLK and one word for each primary communication. During secondary communication, the datapreviously programmed into the registers can be read out. If a register read is not required, all 16 bits are cleared to0 in the secondary communication. This read operation is accomplished by sending the appropriate register address(D11-D9) with the read bit (D12) set to 1 during present secondary communication. The timing sequence is shownin Figures 2 –1 and 2–2.\nThe decimation FIR filter can be bypassed by writing a 1 to bit D2 of control register 1. The whole ADC channel can\nbe turned off for power savings by writing 01 to bits D2 and D1 of control register 3.\nD016 SCLKsSCLK\nFS\nDOUT\n(16-bit)\nDOUT\n(15+1-bit)D1\nMSB LSB\nLSBD15\nM/S D10 1 15 16\nMSBD15D14\nD14……\n……\n…………\nNOTES: A.

The number of SCLKs per data sampling period is 256 if cascading devices are less than 5, or 512 if cascading devices are gre ater\nthan 4.\nFigure 2–2. Timing Sequence of ADC Channel (Primary and Secondary Communication)\n2.1.3 DAC Signal Channel\nDIN received the 16-bit serial data word (2s complement) from the host during the primary communication interval.\nThese 16-bit digital words, representing analog output signal before PGA, are clocked into the serial port (DIN) atthe falling edge of SCLK during the frame-sync interval, one bit for each SCLK and one word for each primarycommunication interval. The data are converted to a pulse train by the sigma-delta DAC comprised of adigital-interpolation filter and a digital 1-bit modulator. The output of the modulator is then passed to an internallow-pass filter to complete the signal reconstruction. Finally, the resulting analog signal applied to the input of aprogrammable-gain amplifier is capable of differentially driving a 600-ohm load at OUTP and OUTM. The timingsequence is shown in Figure 2 –3.\nDuring secondary communication, the digital control and configuration data, together with the register address, are\nclocked in through DIN (see Appendix A for register map). These 16-bit data are used either to initialize the registeror read out register content through DOUT. If a register initialization is not required, a no-operation word (D15-D9 areall set to 0) can be used. If D12 is set to 1, the content of the control register, specified by D7-D0, are sent out throughDOUT during the same secondary communication (see Section 2.1.5). The timing sequence is shown in Figure 2 –4.\nThe interpolation FIR filter can be bypassed by writing a 1 to bit D2 of control register 1. The whole DAC channel can\nbe turned off for power savings by writing 10 to bits D2 and D1 of control register 3.\n2–3D016 SCLKsSCLK\nFS\nDIN\n(16-bit)\nDIN\n(15+1-bit)D1\nMSB LSB\nLSBD15\nD0=0D10 1 15 16\nMSBD15D14\nD14……\n……\n…………14\n(See Note A)\nNOTE A: d0 = 0 means no secondary-communication request (software secondary-request control, see Section 3.2).\nFigure 2–3.

Typical Microphone Interface\n2.1.5 Antialiasing Filter\nThe built-in antialiasing filter has a 3-dB cutoff frequency of 70 kHz.\n2.1.6 Sigma-Delta ADC\nThe sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter is a sigma-delta modulator with 128 × oversampling. The ADC provides\nhigh-resolution, low-noise performance using oversampling techniques. Due to the oversampling employed, onlysingle-pole RC filters are required on the analog inputs.\n2.1.7 Decimation Filter\nThe decimation filters reduce the digital data rate to the sampling rate. This is accomplished by decimating with a ratioof 1:64. The output of the decimation filter is a 16-bit 2s-complement data word clocking at the sample rate selectedfor that particular data channel. The BW of the filter is 0.45 × FS and scales linearly with the sample rate.\n2.1.8 Sigma-Delta DAC\nThe sigma-delta digital-to-analog converter is a sigma-delta modulator with 128 × oversampling. The DAC provides\nhigh-resolution, low-noise performance using oversampling techniques.\n2.1.9 Interpolation Filter\nThe interpolation filter resamples the digital data at a rate of 64 times the incoming sample rate. The high-speed dataoutput from the interpolation filter is then used in the sigma-delta DAC. The BW of the filter is 0.45 x FS and scaleslinearly with the sample rate.\n2–52.1.10 Analog and Digital Loopback\nThe analog and digital loopbacks provide a means of testing the modem data ADC/DAC channels and can be used\nfor in-circuit system level tests. The analog loopback routes the DAC low-pass filter output into the analog input whereit is then converted by the ADC to a digital word. The digital loopback routes the ADC output to the DAC input on thedevice. Analog loopback is enabled by writing 01 to bits D7 and D6 respectively in control register 3. Digital loopback\nis enabled by writing 10 to bits D7 and D6 in control register 3 (see Appendix A).\n2.1.11 FIR Overflow Flag\nThe decimator FIR filter sets an overflow flag (bit D7) in control register 1 to indicate that the input analog signal has\nexceeded the range of the internal decimation-filter calculations. When the FIR overflow flag has been set in theregister, it remains set until the register is read by the user. Reading this value resets the overflow flag.\nIf FIR overflow occurs, the input signal has to be attenuated either by the PGA or some other method.\n2.1.12 FIR Bypass Mode\nAn option is provided to bypass the FIR filter sections of the decimation and interpolation filters. This mode is selected\nthrough bit D2 of control register 1, and effectively increases the frequency of the FS and SCLK signals to 4 timesthe normal FIR-filter output rate, since the decimation/interpolation factor of the bypassed filter stage is 4. The sincfilters of the two paths can not be bypassed.\nThe AIC10 is capable of supporting a maximum of four devices in cascade.\nIf the FIR filter is bypassed, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced to 69 dB. The  FIR bypass mode offers users\nthe flexibility to implement their own decimation/interpolation FIR filter based on application-specific requirements.For example users can select this mode to bypass both decimation and interpolation FIR filters and implement alower-order FIR filter or an IIR filter externally in the DSP for applications that require group delays smaller than 17/Fs,which is the AIC10s total group delay.\n2.1.13 Low-Power Mode\nTo select the low-power mode, in which the AIC10 typically consumes 38.6 mW, set bit D7 of control register 2 to 1and set the sampling rate at 8 ksps.\n2.1.14 Event-Monitor Mode\nThis mode is only available during the register-write cycle, and is enabled by writing 11 to bits D6 and D7 of control\nregister 3; performing a register read terminates event-monitor mode3. The event monitor mode is provided forapplications that need hardware control and monitoring of external events. By allowing the device to drive the FLAGterminal (set through bit D3 of the control register 3), the host DSP is capable of system control through the sameserial port that connects the device. Along with this control is the capability of monitoring the value of the ALTINterminal during a secondary communication cycle. One application of this function is in monitoring RING DETECTor OFFHOOK DETECT from a phone-answering system. FLAG allows response to these incoming control signals.Figure 2–6 shows the timing associated with this operating mode.ÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎ\nÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎFS\nDOUT\nALTDIPrimary Secondary\n16 bits\nNOTE A: When DIN performs a write operation (sets D12 to 0) during secondary communication.\nFigure 2–6. Event Monitor Mode Timing\n2–62.2 Reset and Power-Down Functions\n2.2.1 Software and Hardware Reset\nThe TLV320AIC10 resets the internal counters and registers in response to either of two events:\n•A low-going reset pulse is applied to terminal RESET\n•A 1 is written to the programmable-software reset bit (D3 of control register 1)\nEither event resets the control registers and clears all the sequential circuits in the device. Reset signals should be\nat least six master-clock periods long. It is recommended to synchronize the reset signal with the master clock inmaster/slave cascade, and to tie all reset pins together. For devices in cascade, it takes at least two FS cycles to applysoftware reset to all devices, with the master being always programmed last.\n2.2.2 Software and Hardware Power Down\nWith the exception of the digital interface, the device enters the power-down mode when D1 and D2 in control register3 are set to 1. When PWRDWN is taken low, the entire device is powered down. In either case, the register contentsare preserved and the output of the monitor amplifier is held at the midpoint voltage to minimize pops and clicks.\nThe amount of power drawn during software power down is higher than it is during a hardware power down because\nof the current required to keep the digital interface active. Additional differences between software and hardwarepower-down modes are detailed in the following paragraphs. Figure 2 –7 represents the internal power-down logic.\nPWRDWN\nSoftware Power Down\n(For Control Register 3, D1 & D2)D1 and D2 Are\nProgrammed Through a\nSecondary Write\nOperation\nInternal TLV320AIC10\nFigure 2–7. Internal Power-Down Logic\n2.2.2.1 Software Power Down\nWhen D1 and D2 of control register 3 are set to 1, TLV320AIC10 enters the software power-down mode. In this state,\nthe digital-interface circuit is still active, while the internal ADC and DAC channels and differential outputs OUTP andOUTM are disabled, and DOUT and FSD are inactive. Register data in secondary serial communications is stillaccepted, but data in primary serial communications is ignored. The device returns to normal operation when D1 andD2 of control register 3 are reset.\n2.2.2.2 Hardware Power Down\nWhen PWRDWN  is held low, the device enters the hardware power-down mode. In this state, the internal-clock\ncontrol circuit and the differential outputs OUTP and OUTM are disabled. All other digital I/Os are either disabled, orremain in the same state they were in immediately before power down. DIN can not accept any data input. The devicecan only be returned to normal operation by taking and holding PWRDWN\n high. When not holding the device in the\nhardware power-down mode, PWRDWN  should be tied high.\n2–72.3 Clock Source\nMCLK is the external master-clock input. The clock circuit generates and distributes the necessary clocks throughout\nthe device. When the device is in the master mode, SCLK and FS are output and derived from MCLK in order toprovide clocking of the serial communications between the device and a DSP (digital signal processor). When in theslave mode, SCLK and FS are all inputs. The SCLK can be connected to a faster clock source to speed up serialcommunication between the slave and the master while the internal clock is maintained at 256 clocks per FS periodfor internal processing. In SPI mode, the device is a slave and SCLK is connected to the SPICLK source.\n2.4 Data Out (DOUT)\nDOUT is placed in the high-impedance state after completing transmission of the LSB. In primary communication thedata word is the ADC conversion result. In secondary communication the data in the register read results whenrequested by the read/write (R/W\n) bit. If a register read is not requested, the low eight bits of the secondary word are\nall zeroes. The state of the master/slave (M/S) terminal is reflected by the MSB in secondary communication (DOUT,bit D15), and by the LSB in primary communication (DOUT, bit D0).\n2.4.1 Data Out, Master Mode\nIn the master mode, DOUT is taken from the high-impedance state by the falling edge of the master frame-sync (FS).The most significant data bit then appears first on DOUT.\n2.4.2 Data Out, Slave Mode\nIn the slave mode, DOUT is taken from the high-impedance state by the falling edge of the external frame-sync (FS).The most significant data bit then appears first on DOUT.\n2.5 Data In (DIN)\nIn a primary communication, the data word is the input digital signal to the DAC channel. If (15+1)-bit data format isused, the LSB (D0) is used to request a secondary communication. In a secondary communication, the data is thecontrol and configuration data that sets the device for a particular function (see Section 3, Serial Communications ).\nThe LSB of control register 1 determines whether it is a 15-bit or a 16-bit input.\n2.6 FC (Hardware Secondary Communication Request)\nThe FC input provides for hardware requests for secondary communications. FC works in conjunction with the LSBof the primary data word. FC should be tied low if not used.\n2.7 Frame-Sync Function for TLV320AIC10\nThe frame-sync signal (FS) indicates the device is ready to send or receive data. FS is an output if the M/S pin isconnected to HI (master mode), and an input if the M/S pin is connected to LO (slave mode). The output FSD is adelay version of the first frame-sync signal (FS) that is output 32 SCLKs after the first FS, and serves as theframe-sync input to the next slave (see Figure 2 –14). The data transferred out of DOUT and into DIN begins on the\nfalling edge of the FS signal. It can be configured as a frame or as a pulse signal, as determined by pins M0 and M1.\nIn normal operation, the digital serial interface consists of the shift clock (SCLK), the frame-sync signal (FS), the\nADC-channel data output (DOUT), and the DAC-channel data input (DIN). During the primary frame-synchronizationinterval, SCLK clocks the ADC channel results out through DOUT, and clocks 16-bit/(15+1) DAC data in through DIN.\nDuring the secondary frame-sync interval, SCLK clocks the register data out through DOUT in normal operation. If\nthe read bit (D12) is set to 1 and the device transfers control and device parameter in through DOUT. The timingsequence is shown in Figures 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, and 2-4.\n2–8The TLV320AIC10 has four serial-interface modes that support most modern DSP engines. This modes can be\nselected by M0 and M1. In mode 0 (Figure 2 –8), FS is one-bit wide and it is active high one SCLK period before the\nfirst bit (MSB) of each data transmission. In modes 1 (Figure 2 –9) and 2 (Figure 2 –10), the TLV320AIC10 operates\nas a slave to interface with an SPI master in which FS is the SPISEL that determines the sampling rate. SCLK needsto be free-running. In mode 3 (Figure 2 –11), FS is low during data transmission into DIN and DOUT.\nTable 2–1.

In this mode, the data bits are\ntransmitted and received contiguously with no inactivity between bits at the very next FS, and no further frame syncFSs are generated. Secondary communication is not available. To disable the continuous transfer mode, use thedirect-configuration mode (see Section 3.3) or reset the device.\n2.7.2Frame-Sync (FS) Function —Fast-Transfer Mode (Slave Only)\nBy connecting the fast clock to the SCLK pin, data can be transmitted and received at a higher rate than 256 x Fs\nin the slave mode for a stand-alone AIC10.\n2.7.3Frame-Sync (FS) Function —Master Mode\nThe master mode in the TLV320AIC10 is selected by connecting pin M/S pin to HI. In the master mode, the\nTLV320AIC10 generates the frame-sync signal (FS) to the DSP that goes low on the rising edge of SCLK and remainslow during a 16-bit data transfer.\nDIN/DOUTPrimary Secondary16 SCLKs\nPrimary16 SCLKs\nFS\n(see Note B)FS\n(see Note A)\nPrimary Primary\nNOTES: A.

Master Device ’s FS Output to DSP and FSD Output to the Slave\n2.7.5Frame-Sync Delayed (FSD) Function, Cascade Mode\nIn cascade mode, the DSP must be able to identify the master and slaves according to the register map shown in\nAppendix A. Each device in the cascade contains a 3-bit cascade register (D15-D13 in the register address) that hasbeen programmed by the ACD (automatic cascade detection) with an address value equal to its position in thecascade during the device ’s power-up initialization (see Appendix A). The device address of the master is always\nequal to the number of slaves in the cascade. For example, in Figure 2 –14, D15-D13 of the master is 011, as shown\nin row 4 of Table A-1 (Appendix A). The DSP receives all frame-sync pulses from the master though the masters FS.The master FSD is output to the first slave, and the first slave FSD is output to the second slave device, and so on.Figure 2–14 shows the cascade of 4 TLV320AIC10s in which the closest one to the DSP is the master, and the rest\nare slaves. The FSD output of each device is input to the FS terminal of the succeeding device.

The gain of the input amplifiers is setthrough control register 4.\n2.8.1Multiplexed Analog Input\nTo produce excellent common-mode rejection of unwanted-signal performance, the analog signal is processed\ndifferentially until it is converted to digital data. The signal applied to the INM and INP terminals should be differentialto preserve the device specifications. The signal source driving the analog inputs (INP and INM, or AUXP and AUXM)should have a low source impedance to attain the lowest noise performance and accuracy. To obtain maximumdynamic range, the signal should be ac-coupled to the input terminal. The analog input signal is self-biased to themid-supply. Bits D3 and D4 of control register 1 select these input sources. The default condition self-biases the input,since the register default value selects INP and INM as the sources for the ADC.\nTLV320AIC10INPVINP\nINMVINMAVDD/2\nFigure 2–16.

Differential Output Drive (Ground-Referenced )\n2.8.3Single-Ended Analog Input\nThe two differential inputs (INP and INM, or AUXP and AUXM) can be configured to work as single-ended inputs by\nconnecting INP or AUXP to the analog input, and INM or AUXM to the external common-mode input. This is illustratedin Figure 2 –18.\nFollowing are the valid single-ended input configuration:\n•If the signal common-mode is about 2.5 V, then connect signal to INP and its common mode to INM.\n•If the common mode of the input signal is different from 2.5 V, then capacitively couple signal onto INP and\ncapacitively couple common mode onto INM.Special case: If common mode of signal is AGND, then capacitively couple AGND onto INM.\nWhenever INP and INM are both capacitively coupled the device internally sets the bias. Never connect AGND\ndirectly to INM. It sets input common mode to AGND which would mean the negative going signal gets clamped.\nAnalog Input INP\nINM Common-Mode InputC\nFigure 2–18.

This is illustrated in Figure 2 –19.\nRLOUTP\nOUTMC\nFigure 2–19. Single-Ended Output\n3–13 Serial Communications\nDOUT, DIN, SCLK, SXCLK, FS, and Fc are the serial communication signals. SCLK is used to perform internal\nprocessing and data transfer for serial interface between AIC10 and DSP. In the pulse/frame FS mode, there are 256SCLKs per sampling period (512 if there are more than 4 devices in cascade). The digital-output data for the ADCis taken from DOUT. The digital-input data for the DAC is applied to DIN. The synchronization clock for the serialcommunication data and the frame-sync is taken from SCLK. The frame-sync signal that starts the ADC and DACdata-transfer interval is taken from FS. Primary serial communication is used for signal data transmitted from the ADCor to the DAC. Secondary communication is used to read or write words that control both the options and the circuitconfigurations of the device.\nThe purpose of the primary and secondary communications is to allow conversion data and control data to be\ntransferred across the same serial port. A primary transfer is always dedicated to conversion data. A secondarytransfer or an asynchronous communication is used to set up and/or read the register values. A primary transferoccurs for every conversion period. A secondary transfer occurs only when requested. Secondary serialcommunication can be requested either by hardware (FC terminal) or by software (D0 of primary data input to DIN).The direct configuration mode uses pin DCSI to program control registers instantly.\n3.1 Primary Serial Communication\nPrimary serial communication is used to transmit and receive conversion signal data. The DAC word length dependson the states of bit D0 in control register 1. After power up or reset, the device defaults to 15-bit mode. When the DACword length is 15 bits, the last bit of the primary 16-bit serial communication word is a control bit used to requestsecondary serial communication. In the 16-bit mode, all 16 bits of the primary-communication word are used as datafor the DAC, and the hardware terminal FC must be used to request secondary communication.\nFigure 3-1 shows the timing relationship for SCLK, FS, DOUT, and DIN in a primary communication. The timing\nsequence for this operation is as follows:\n•FS is brought low by the TLV320AIC10.\n•A 16-bit word is transmitted from the ADC (DOUT), and then a 16-bit word is received from the DAC (DIN).\nD0 D13 D15 D14 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1SCLK\nFS\nDIN\nD0 D13 D15 D14 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 DOUT\nFigure 3–1. Primary Serial Communication Timing\n3–23.2 Secondary Serial Communication\nSecondary serial communication is used to read or write 16-bit words that program both the options and the circuit\nconfigurations of the device. Register programming always occurs during secondary communication. Four primaryand secondary communication cycles are requested to program the four registers. If the default value for a particularregister is desired, then the register addressing can be omitted during secondary communications. The NOOPcommand addresses a pseudo-register (register 0), and no register programming takes place during this secondarycommunication. If secondary communication is desired for any device (either master or slave), then a secondarycommunication must be requested for all devices, starting with the master. This results in a secondary frame-sync(FS) for all devices. The NOOP command can be used for devices that do not need a secondary operation.\nDuring a secondary communication, a register can be written to or read from. When writing  to a register, DIN contains\nthe value to be written. The data returned on DOUT is + 0000000000000 (3-bit device address).\nThere are two methods of initiating a secondary communication, as illustrated in Figure 3 –2:\n•Asserting a high level on FC (hardware request)\n•Asserting the LSB of the DIN 16-bit serial communication high while in the 15-bit mode (software request)\nNOTE:The secondary communication request should not be asserted during the first two\nsamples after power up.\nFC\n(Hardware)\n16-Bit Mode(Control 1 Register, D0)\nInternal TLV320AIC10(LSB of DIN)Secondary Request\nFigure 3–2. Hardware and Software Secondary Communication Request\nPulling FC high causes the start of the secondary communications 128 or 256 SCLKs (see Figures 2 –2 and 2–4) after\nthe start of the primary communication frame, depending on the number of devices in cascade.\nThe second method to initiate a secondary communication is asserting the LSB high. A software request is typically\nused when the request resolution of the DAC channel is less than 16 bits. Then the least significant bit (D0) can beused for secondary requests, as shown in Table 3 –1. The request is made by placing the device in the 15-bit DAC\nmode and making the LSB of DIN high. All cascading devices must be in 15-bit DAC mode, and set their LSBs to 1sfor requesting software secondary communication.\nTable 3–1. Least Significant Bit Control Function\nCONTROL BIT D0 CONTROL BIT FUNCTION\n0 No operation (NOOP)\n1 Secondary communication request\n3–33.2.1 Register Programming\nAll register programming occurs during secondary communication through DIN or ALTI, and data are latched and\nvalid on the falling edge of the SCLK during the frame-sync signal. If the default value of a particular register is desired,that register does not need to be addressed during the secondary communication interval. The NOOP command(DS15-DS8 all set to 0) addresses the pseudo-register (register 0), and no register programming takes place duringthe communication.\nIn addition, each register can be read back through DOUT during secondary communications by setting the read bit\n(D12) to 1. When a register is in the read mode, no data can be written to the register during this cycle . A subsequent\nsecondary communication is required to return this register to the write mode.\nFor example, if the contents of control register 1 of device 3 are desired to be read out from DOUT, the following\nprocedure must be performed through DIN:\n•Request secondary communication by setting either D0 = 1(software request), or FC = high (hardware\nrequest) during the primary communication interval.\n•During the secondary communication interval (FS), send data in through DIN using the following format:\nDevice Address RW Register Address X Register Content\n0111001xxxxxxxxx\nDS15 DS0\n•Then, during the same frame, the following data is read from DOUT; the last 8 bits of DOUT contains\n register 1 data.\nDevice Address RW Register Address X Register Content\n011xxxxxdddddddd\nDS15 DS0\nFigure 3–3 is the timing diagram of this procedure.\nDOUTPS\nDIN Register 1 ReadFS\nLow 8 Bit (D0 – D7) Is\nthe Content of Register\n1\nFigure 3–3.

Device 3/Register 1 Write Operation Timing Diagram\n3.2.2 Hardware Secondary Serial Communication Request\nA secondary communication can be requested by asserting an FC pulse that sets an internal flag. This flag is reset\nas soon as the programming of control registers is finished. Thus, one FC pulse needs to be asserted per secondarycommunication request.

Output When Hardware Secondary Serial Communication Is Requested (Three Slaves)\n3.2.3 Software Secondary Serial Communication Request\nThe LSB of the DAC data within a primary transfer can request a secondary communication through bit D0 of control\nregister 1 when the device is in the 15-bit mode.\nFor all serial communications, the most significant bit is transferred first. For a 16-bit ADC word and a 16-bit DAC word,\nD15 is the most significant bit and D0 is the least significant bit. For a 15-bit DAC data word in a primary\ncommunication, D15 is the most significant bit, D1 is the least significant bit. Bit D0 is then used for the secondarycommunication request control. All digital data values are in 2s-complement data format (see Figure 3 –7).\nIf the data format is set to 16-bit word, all 16 bits are either ADC or DAC data, and secondary communication can\nonly be requested by hardware (FC terminal), or control registers can be programmed by the direct configurationmode.\nPS\nDINRegisterFS\nNo Secondary\nCommunication RequestData (D0 = 1)Read/WriteP\nData (D0 = 0)\nSecondary\nCommunication Request\nFigure 3–7.

The serial input to DCSI should normally be in a high state, start its valid data with a start bit of logic low, andpull high as a stop bit after transmission of the LSB. DCSI requires a pullup resistor for 3-state input. The AIC10registers data bits on the falling edge of SCLK. Figure 3 –8 shows a typical connection between the C54x and the\nAIC10 using DCSI for direct configuration of control registers. Figure 3 –9 shows the timing diagram for the direct\nconfiguration mode.\n3–6TMS320C54XX TLV320AIC10DCSI\nM/S\nFSD FS\nDIN\nDOUT\nSCLKDVDD\nTLV320AIC10DCSI\nM/S\nFS\nDIN\nDOUT\nSCLKDGNDDX0\nFSX1\nFSR1\nDX1\nDR1\nCLKX1\nCLKR1CLKX0DVDD\n1 kΩ\nTMS320C5402 TLV320AIC10MCLK DCSI\nFSDFS\nDIN\nDOUT\nSCLK\nHost ProcessorSDO\nCLKINBFSX0\nBFSR0\nBDX0\nBDR0\nBCLKX0\nBCLKR0DVDD\n1 kΩMCLK\nM/S DVDD(Use Pullup Resistor if\nSDO Is 3-State Serial Bus)(a) Direct Configuration Between C54 and AIC10\n(b) Direct Configuration for Host Interface\nFigure 3–8.

This mode is available in the stand-alone master with M1M0 = 00 (FS-pulse mode) and selected by setting bitD5 of control register 3 to 1. The secondary communication request is not allowed in this mode and therefore the directconfiguration mode should be used to program the internal control registers. The continuous data transfer mode isdesigned to support the TI DSP McBSPs autobuffering unit (ABU) operation in which serial port interrupts are notgenerated with each word transferred to prevent CPUs ISR overheads.\nD15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nD15 D14 D13 D12 D11 D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0SCLK\nFS\nDIN\nDOUTE15 E13 E12\nE15 E14 E13 E12E14 C0\nC0\nFigure 3–10.

In cascading, the master is the device directly connected to the DSP. For example, if there are fourdevices in the cascade, as shown in row 4 of Table A-1 and in Section 2.7.5, the device address D15-D13 of the masterwill have a binary value of 011. The other three slaves addresses are 010, 001, and 000, corresponding to their\npositions in the cascade. The device address for a stand-alone device is always 000. Bits D11 through D8 comprise\nthe address of the register that is written with data carried in D7 through D0. D12 determines a read or write cycleto the addressed register; a low selects a write cycle.\nThe following table shows the register map.\nREGISTER MAP\nD15D14D13D12D11D10 D9D8D7D6D5D4D3D2D1D0\nDevice Address RW Register Address X Control Register Content\nTable A–1.
