General description\nThe NX3DV42 is a double-pole double-throw analog switch suitable for use as an analog \nor digital multiplexer/demultip lexer. Its wide bandwidth and lo w bit-to-bit skew allows the \nNX3DV42 to pass high-speed differential si gnals with good signal integrity. Its high \nchannel to channel crosstalk rejection re sults in minimal nois e interference. The \nbandwidth is wide enough to pass high-speed USB 2.0 differential signals (480 Mb/s). It \nconsist of two switches, each with two in dependent input/outputs (HSDn+ and HSDn \uf02d) \nand a common input/output (D+ or D \uf02d). One digital input (S) is used to select the switch \nposition. When pin OE  is HIGH, the switches are turned off. Schmitt trigger action at the \nselect input (S) and output enable input (OE ) makes the circuit tolerant to slower input rise \nand fall times across the entire V CC range from 3.0 V to 4.3 V.\n2.

Limiting values\n \n[1] The minimum input voltage rating may be exceeded if the input current rating is observed.\n[2] For XQFN10 package: above 100 \uf0b0C derate linearly with 4 mW/K.\n10. Recommended operating conditions\n \n[1] To avoid sinking GND current  from terminals D+ and D \uf02d when switch current flows in terminals HSDn+ and HSDn \uf02d, the voltage drop \nacross the bidirectional switch must not exceed 0.4 V. If  the switch current flows into terminals D+ and D \uf02d, no GND current will flow from \nterminals HSDn+ and HSDn \uf02d. In this case, there is no limit for the voltage drop across the switch.Table 5. Limiting values\nIn accordance with the Absolute Maximum Rating System (IEC 60134).

#### Description:
The **NX3DV42** is a **double-pole double-throw (DPDT) analog switch** designed for high-speed applications. It functions as an analog or digital multiplexer/demultiplexer, allowing for the routing of signals between different paths. The device is optimized for high-speed differential signals, making it suitable for applications such as USB 2.0 data transmission.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Consumer Electronics:**
  - Cell phones, PDAs, digital cameras, and notebooks
- **Display Technology:**
  - LCD monitors and TVs
- **Set-Top Boxes:**
  - Used in devices that require signal switching capabilities for video and audio signals

The NX3DV42 is particularly useful in scenarios where high-speed data integrity is crucial, such as in USB communications, due to its low crosstalk and high bandwidth capabilities.
