The deviceoperates from an 8V to 28V supply range.\nThe MAX9737 features filterless, spread-spectrum\nmodulation, externally set gain and a low-power shut-down mode that reduces supply current to less than1µA. Comprehensive click-and-pop suppression andprecharge circuitry reduce noise into and out of shut-down or mute within 10ms.\nSpread-Spectrum Modulation\nThe MAX9737 features a unique spread-spectrumswitching modulation that flattens EMI wideband spec-tral components, reducing radiated emissions from thespeaker and cables. The switching frequency of theClass D amplifier varies randomly by ±4kHz around the300kHz center frequency. Instead of a large amount ofspectral energy present at multiples of the switchingfrequency, the energy is spread over a bandwidth thatincreases with frequency. Above a few MHz, the wide-band spectrum looks like white noise for EMI purposes.A proprietary amplifier topology ensures this whitenoise does not corrupt the noise floor in the audiobandwidth.\nEfficiency\nThe high efficiency of a Class D amplifier is due to theoutput transistors acting as switches and therefore con-sume negligible power. Power loss associated with theClass D output stage is due to the MOSFET I\n2R losses,\nswitching losses, and quiescent current.\nAlthough the theoretical best efficiency of a linear\namplifier is 78% at peak output power, under typicalmusic reproduction levels, the efficiency falls to below40%. The MAX9737 exhibits > 80% efficiency under thesame conditions (Figure 1).\nShutdown\nThe MAX9737 features a shutdown mode that reducespower consumption to less than 1µA (typ), extendingbattery life in portable applications. Drive SHDN low to\nplace the device in low-power shutdown mode. In shut-down mode, the outputs are high impedance and thecommon-mode voltage at the output decays to zero.\nMAX9737Mono 7W Class D Amplifier\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 7Pin Description\nPIN NAME FUNCTION\n1, 17, 18 PVDDPower Supply.

Must be externally connected to PGND.\nMAX9737Mute Function\nThe MAX9737 features a mute mode where the signal is\nattenuated at the speaker and the outputs stop switch-ing. To mute the MAX9737, drive MUTE low.\nClick-and-Pop Suppression\nThe MAX9737 features comprehensive click-and-pop\nsuppression and precharge circuitry that reduce audi-ble transients on startup and shutdown. The prechargecircuit enables the amplifier within 10ms without anyclicks or pops. Connect PC between the input resistor(R\nIN) and the input capacitor (C IN). For optimal click-\nand-pop suppression, use a 0.47µF input couplingcapacitor (C\nIN).\nCurrent Limit\nWhen output current exceeds the current limit, 4.6A(typ), the MAX9737 disables the outputs and initiates a450µs startup sequence. The shutdown and startupsequence is repeated until the output fault is removed.Properly designed applications do not enter current-limit mode unless the output is short circuited or con-nected incorrectly.\nThermal Shutdown\nWhen the die temperature exceeds the thermal-shut-down threshold, +160°C (typ), the MAX9737 outputsare disabled. When the die temperature decreases by30°C, normal operation resumes. Some causes of ther-mal shutdown are excessively low load impedance,poor thermal contact between the MAX9737’s exposedpad and the PCB, elevated ambient temperature, orpoor PCB layout and assembly.\nApplications Information\nFilterless Class D Operation\nThe MAX9737 meets EN55022B EMC radiation limitswith an inexpensive ferrite bead and capacitor filterwhen the speaker leads are less than or equal to 1m(Figure 3). Select a ferrite bead with 100 Ωto 600Ω\nimpedance, and rated for 2A. The capacitor valuevaries based on the ferrite bead chosen and the speak-er lead length. See Figure 2 for the correct connectionsof these components.Mono 7W Class D Amplifier\n8 _______________________________________________________________________________________020\n1040\n3060\n507090\n80100\n02 3 1 45678EFFICIENCY\nvs. OUTPUT POWER\nOUTPUT POWER (W)EFFICIENCY (%)MAX9737\nCLASS AB\nFigure 1.

MAX9737 EMI Performance with 1m Twisted-Pair\nSpeaker Cable\nWhen evaluating the MAX9737 with a ferrite bead filter\nand resistive load, include a series inductor (68µH for8Ωload and 33µH for 4 Ωload) to model typical loud-\nspeaker’s behavior. Omitting the series inductorreduces the efficiency, the THD+N performance andthe output power of the MAX9737. When evaluatingwith a loudspeaker, no series inductor is required.\nInductor-Based Output Filters\nSome applications use the MAX9737 with a full induc-tor/capacitor-based (LC) output filter. See Figure 4 forthe correct connections of these components.\nThe load impedance of the speaker determines the fil-\nter component selection (see Table 1).\nInductors L1 and L2 and capacitor C1 form the primary\noutput filter. Capacitors C2 and C3 provide common-mode filtering to reduce radiated emissions. CapacitorsC4 and C5, plus resistors R1 and R2, form a Zobel atthe output. A Zobel corrects the output loading to com-pensate for the rising impedance of the loudspeaker.Without a Zobel, the filter exhibits peaking near the cut-off frequency.\nComponent Selection\nGain-Setting Resistors\nThe output stage provides a fixed internal gain in addi-tion to the externally set input stage gain. The fixed-out-put stage gain is set at 13.6dB (4.8V/V). Set overall gainby using resistors R\nFand R IN(Figure 5) as follows:\nwhere A Vis the desired voltage gain. Choose R F\nbetween 10k Ωand 50kΩ.\nThe PRE terminal is an operational amplifier output,\nallowing the MAX9737 to be configured as a filter or anequalizer.\nInput Capacitor\nAn input capacitor, C IN, in conjunction with the input\nresistor, R IN, of the MAX9737 forms a highpass filter\nthat removes the DC bias from an incoming signal. TheAC-coupling capacitor allows the amplifier to bias thesignal to an optimum DC level. Assuming negligiblesource impedance, the -3dB point of the highpass filteris given by:Choose C\nINsuch that f -3dB is well below the lowest fre-\nquency of interest. To reduce low-frequency distortion,use capacitors whose dielectrics have low-voltagecoefficients. Capacitors with high-voltage coefficientscause increased distortion close to f\n-3dB. For best click-\nand-pop suppression, use a 0.47µF input capacitor.\nCOM Capacitor\nCOM is the output of the internally generated DC biasvoltage. Bypass COM with a 1µF capacitor to AGND.\nRegulator Capacitor\nREG is the output of the internally generated DC biasvoltage. Bypass REG with a 1µF capacitor to AGND.\nPower Supplies\nThe MAX9737 features separate supplies for signal andpower portions of the device, allowing for the optimumcombination of headroom, power dissipation and noiseimmunity. The speaker amplifiers are powered fromPVDD and can range from 8V to 28V. The remainder ofthe device is powered by an internal 5V regulator, V\nS.\nInternal Regulator\nThe MAX9737 features an internal 5V regulator, V S,\npowered from PVDD.

Use wide traces for the power-supplyinputs and amplifier outputs to minimize losses due toparasitic trace resistance. Proper grounding improvesaudio performance, minimizes crosstalk between chan-nels, and prevents switching noise from coupling intothe audio signal. Connect PGND and AGND together ata single point on the PCB. Route all traces that carryswitching transients away from AGND and thetraces/components in the audio signal path.\nBypass PVDD with two 1µF capacitors to PGND. Place\nthe bypass capacitors as close as possible to theMAX9737. Place a 100µF capacitor between PVDD andPGND. Bypass V\nS,VCOM, and V REG with a 1µF capacitor\nto AGND.Use wide, low-resistance output traces. Current drawn\nfrom the outputs increases as load impedancedecreases. High-output trace resistance decreases thepower delivered to the load. The MAX9737 TQFN pack-age features an exposed thermal pad on its underside.This pad lowers the package’s thermal resistance byproviding a heat conduction path from the die to thePCB. Connect the exposed thermal pad to PGND byusing a large pad and multiple vias to the PGND plane. \nMAX9737Mono 7W Class D Amplifier\n______________________________________________________________________________________ 1123 24 22 21\n8 79CHOLD\nMUTE\nSHDN\nPC\n10PVDD\nPVDD\nC1N\nVSPVDD\nVS1\n2\nPGND\n4\n5\n61718\n16\n14\n13OUT+OUT+\nAGNDCOMPREINMAX9737AGND C1P 3\n15PGND\n20\n11\nAGND OUT-\n19\n12REG OUT-\nTQFN\n4mm x 4mmTOP VIEW\n*EP\n*EP = EXPOSED PAD, CONNECT TO PGND+Pin Configuration Chip Information\nPROCESS: BiCMOS\nMAX9737Mono 7W Class D Amplifier\n12 ______________________________________________________________________________________PACKAGE TYPE PACKAGE CODE DOCUMENT NO.\n24 TQFN-EP T2444+4 21-0139Package Information\nFor the latest package outline information and land patterns, go to www.maxim-ic.com/packages .\n24L QFN THIN.EPS\nMAX9737Mono 7W Class D Amplifier\nMaxim cannot assume responsibility for use of any circuitry other than circuitry entirely embodied in a Maxim product.
