When an I/O pin is configured as an analog output, it is\ndriven by a 12-bit DAC. The output range of the DAC is 0 V to VREF\nor 0 V to 2 × VREF. When an I/O pin is configured as an analog\ninput, it is connected to a 12-bit ADC via an analog multiplexer.\nThe input range of the ADC is 0 V to VREF or 0 V to 2 × VREF.\nThe I/O pins can also be configured to be general-purpose, digital\ninput or output (GPIO) pins. The state of the GPIO pins can be set\nor read back by accessing the GPIO write data register and GPIO\nread configuration registers, respectively, via an I2C write or read\noperation.\nThe AD5593R  has an integrated 2.5 V, 20 ppm/°C reference that\nis turned off by default and an integrated temperature indicator that\ngives an indication of the die temperature. The temperature value is\nread back as part of an ADC read sequence.\nThe AD5593R  is available in 16-lead TSSOP  and LFCSP , as well\nas a 16-ball WLCSP , and operates over a temperature range of\n−40°C to +105°C.\nTable 1.

Careful attention to PCB\nthermal design is required.\nThermal characteristics are specified for the worst-case conditions,\nthat is, a device soldered in a circuit board for surface-mount pack-\nages. Thermal resistance values specified in Table 5  are simulated\nbased on JEDEC specifications using a 2S2P thermal test board\n(see JEDEC JESD51), except for θJC-TOP , which uses a JEDEC 1S\ntest board.\nθJA is the junction to ambient thermal resistance, measured in a\nJEDEC natural convection environment.\nθJC is the junction to case thermal resistance, measured at the cen-\nter of the package top surface, with an infinite heat sink attached to\nthe package surface.\nθJB is the junction to board thermal resistance, measured at a point\non the board 1mm from the package edge, along the package\ncenterline, measured in a JEDEC θJB environment.\nΨJB is the junction to board thermal characterization parameter,\nmeasured in a JEDEC natural convection environment.\nΨJT is the junction to package top thermal characterization parame-\nter, measured in a JEDEC natural convection environment.Do not use θJA, θJC, and θJB thermal resistances to perform direct\ncalculation/measurement of the die temperature because doing so\nresults in incorrect values. The thermal resistances assume 100%\nof the power that is dissipated along the specified path between the\nmeasurement points. The thermal resistances are directly depend-\nent on the PCB design and environment.\nIf direct measurement of the package is required, the ΨJT and ΨJB\nvalues must be used because they more accurately reflect the true\nthermal dissipation paths.\nθJC must only be used where an external heat sink is attached\ndirectly to the package.\nSystem level thermal simulation is highly recommended.\nFor more details about the thermal resistances, refer to JE-\nDEC51-12: Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package\nThermal Information .\nTable 5.

H | 14 of 47ADC Integral Nonlinearity (INL)\nFor the ADC, INL is the maximum deviation from a straight line\npassing through the endpoints of the ADC transfer function. The\nend points of the transfer function are zero scale, a point that is\n1 LSB below the first code transition, and full scale, a point that is 1\nLSB above the last code transition.\nADC Differential Nonlinearity (DNL)\nFor the ADC, DNL is the difference between the measured and the\nideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes in the ADC.\nOffset Error\nOffset error is the deviation of the first code transition (00 … 000) to\n(00 … 001) from the ideal, that is, AGND + 1 LSB.\nGain Error\nGain error is the deviation of the last code transition (111 … 110) to\n(111 … 111) from the ideal (that is, VREF − 1 LSB) after the offset\nerror has been adjusted out.\nChannel-to-Channel Isolation\nChannel-to-channel isolation is a measure of the level of crosstalk\nbetween channels. It is measured by applying a full-scale 5 kHz\nsine wave signal to all non-selected ADC input channels and deter-\nmining how much that signal is attenuated in the selected channel.\nThis specification is the worst case across all ADC channels for the\nAD5593R .\nTrack-and-Hold Acquisition Time\nThe track-and-hold amplifier goes into track mode when the ADC\nsequence register has been written to. The track and hold amplifier\ngoes into hold mode when the conversion starts (see Figure 39 ).\nTrack-and-hold acquisition time is the minimum time required for\nthe track-and-hold amplifier to remain in track mode for its output to\nreach and settle to within ±1 LSB of the applied input signal, given a\nstep change to the input signal.\nSignal-to-Noise Distortion Ratio SINAD\nSINAD is the measured ratio of signal to (noise + distortion) at the\noutput of the analog-to-digital converter. The signal is the rms am-\nplitude of the fundamental. Noise is the sum of all non-fundamental\nsignals up to half the sampling frequency (fS/2), excluding dc. The\nratio is dependent on the number of quantization levels in the\ndigitization process; the more levels, the smaller the quantization\nnoise. The theoretical SINAD for an ideal N-bit converter with a sine\nwave input is given by\nSignal-to-(Noise + Distortion) (dB) = 6.02N + 1.76\nThus, for a 12-bit converter, this is 74 dB.Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)\nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of harmonics to the fundamental.\nFor the AD5593R , it is defined as\nTHD dB = 20 × logV 22 + V 32 + V 42 + V 52 + V 62\nV 1(1)\nwhere V1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental and V2, V3, V4,\nV5, and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second through the sixth\nharmonics.\nPeak Harmonic or Spurious Noise\nPeak harmonic or spurious noise is defined as the ratio of the rms\nvalue of the next largest component in the ADC output spectrum\n(up to fS/2 and excluding dc) to the rms value of the fundamental.\nNormally, the value of this specification is determined by the largest\nharmonic in the spectrum, but for ADCs where the harmonics are\nburied in the noise floor, it is a noise peak.\nDAC Relative Accuracy or Integral Nonlinearity\n(INL)\nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity is a meas-\nurement of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a straight line\npassing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer function. A\ntypical INL vs. code plot is shown in Figure 13 .\nDAC Differential Nonlinearity (DNL)\nFor the DAC, differential nonlinearity is the difference between\nthe measured change and the ideal 1 LSB change between any\ntwo adjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB\nmaximum ensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteed monotonic\nby design. A typical DNL vs. code plot can be seen in Figure 14 .\nZero Code Error\nZero code error is a measurement of the output error when zero\ncode (0x000) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the output is 0\nV. The zero code error is always positive in the AD5593R because\nthe output of the DAC cannot go below 0 V due to a combination\nof the offset errors in the DAC and the output amplifier. Zero code\nerror is expressed in mV.\nGain Error\nGain error is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the\ndeviation in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from the ideal\nexpressed as % of FSR.\nOffset Error\nOffset error is a measure of the difference between VOUT (actual)\nand VOUT (ideal) expressed in mV in the linear region of the transfer\nfunction. Offset error can be negative or positive.\nData Sheet AD5593R\nTERMINOLOGY\nanalog.com Rev. H | 15 of 47Offset Error Drift\nOffset error drift is a measurement of the change in offset error with\na change in temperature. It is expressed in µV/°C.\nDAC DC Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)\nFor the DAC, PSRR indicates how the output of the DAC is affected\nby changes in the supply voltage. PSRR is the ratio of the change\nin VOUT to a change in VDD for full-scale output of the DAC. It is\nmeasured in mV/V. VREF is held at 2 V, and VDD is varied by ±10%.\nOutput Voltage Settling Time\nOutput voltage settling time is the amount of time it takes for the\noutput of a DAC to settle to a specified level for a ¼ to ¾ full-scale\ninput change and is measured from the rising edge of SDA that\ngenerates the stop condition.\nDigital-to-Analog Glitch Impulse\nDigital-to-analog glitch impulse is the impulse injected into the\nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes\nstate. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in nV-sec, and\nis measured when the digital input code is changed by 1 LSB at the\nmajor carry transition (0x7FF to 0x800) (see Figure 16  and Figure\n17).\nDigital Feedthrough\nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into the\nanalog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the DAC, but\nis measured when the DAC output is not updated. It is specified in\nnV-sec, and measured with a full-scale code change on the data\nbus, that is, from all 0s to all 1s and vice versa.\nReference Feedthrough\nReference feedthrough is the ratio of the amplitude of the signal at\nthe DAC output to the reference input when the DAC output is not\nbeing updated. It is expressed in dB.\nNoise Spectral Density (NSD)\nNSD is a measurement of the internally generated random noise.\nRandom noise is characterized as a spectral density (nV/ √Hz). It is\nmeasured by loading the DAC to midscale and measuring noise at\nthe output. It is measured in nV/ √Hz. A plot of noise spectral density\nis shown in Figure 25 .\nDC Crosstalk\nDC crosstalk is the dc change in the output level of one DAC in\nresponse to a change in the output of another DAC. It is measured\nwith a full-scale output change on one DAC (or soft power-down\nand power-up) while monitoring another DAC kept at midscale. It is\nexpressed in μV.\nDC crosstalk due to load current change is a measure of the impact\nthat a change in load current on one DAC has to another DAC kept\nat midscale. It is expressed in μV/mA.Digital Crosstalk\nDigital crosstalk is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one\nDAC at midscale in response to a full-scale code change (all 0s\nto all 1s and vice versa) in the input register of another DAC. It is\nmeasured in standalone mode and is expressed in nV-sec.\nAnalog Crosstalk\nAnalog crosstalk is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of\none DAC due to a change in the output of another DAC. It is first\nmeasured by loading one of the input registers with a full-scale\ncode change (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa). Then it is measured\nby executing software LDAC and monitoring the output of the DAC\nwhose digital code was not changed. The area of the glitch is\nexpressed in nV-sec.\nDAC-to-DAC Crosstalk\nDAC-to-DAC crosstalk is the glitch impulse transferred to the output\nof one DAC due to a digital code change and subsequent analog\noutput change of another DAC. It is measured by loading the attack\nchannel with a full-scale code change (all 0s to all 1s and vice\nversa), using the write to and update commands while monitoring\nthe output of the victim channel that is at midscale. The energy of\nthe glitch is expressed in nV-sec.\nMultiplying Bandwidth\nThe amplifiers within the DAC have a finite bandwidth. The multiply-\ning bandwidth is a measure of this finite bandwidth. A sine wave on\nthe reference (with full-scale code loaded to the DAC) appears on\nthe output. The multiplying bandwidth is the frequency at which the\noutput amplitude falls to 3 dB below the input.\nDAC Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)\nFor the DAC, THD is the difference between an ideal sine wave\nand its attenuated version using the DAC. The sine wave is used as\nthe reference for the DAC, and the THD is a measurement of the\nharmonics present on the DAC output. It is measured in dB.\nVoltage Reference Temperature Coefficient\n(TC)\nVoltage reference TC is a measure of the change in the reference\noutput voltage with a change in temperature. The voltage reference\nTC is calculated using the box method, which defines the TC as the\nmaximum change in the reference output over a given temperature\nrange expressed in ppm/°C, as follows:\nTC =V R EF ( M A X ) − V R EF ( MI N )\nV RE F ( NOM ) × Tem p Ran g e× 106(2)\nwhere:\nVREF(MAX)  is the maximum reference output measured over the total\ntemperature range.\nVREF(MIN)  is the minimum reference output measured over the total\ntemperature range.\nData Sheet AD5593R\nTERMINOLOGY\nanalog.com Rev. H | 16 of 47VREF(NOM)  is the nominal reference output voltage, 2.5 V. Temp Range  is the specified temperature range of −40°C to\n+105°C.\nData Sheet AD5593R\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. H | 17 of 47The AD5593R  is an 8-channel, configurable analog and digital\nI/O port. The AD5593R  has eight pins that can be independently\nconfigured as a 12-bit DAC output channel, a 12-bit ADC input\nchannel, a digital input pin, or a digital output pin.\nThe function of each pin is determined by programming the ADC,\nDAC, or GPIO configuration registers as appropriate.\nDAC SECTION\nThe AD5593R  contains eight 12-bit DACs. Each DAC consists of a\nstring of resistors followed by an output buffer amplifier. Figure 31\nshows a block diagram of the DAC architecture.\nFigure 31. DAC Channel Architecture Block Diagram\nThe DAC channels share a single DAC range bit (in the General-\nPurpose Control Register  section, see Bit 4 in Table 19 ) that sets\nthe output range to 0 V to VREF or 0 V to 2 × VREF. Because the\nrange bit is shared by all channels, it is not possible to set different\noutput ranges on a per channel basis. The input coding to the DAC\nis straight binary. Therefore, the ideal output voltage is given by\nV OU T = G × V RE F ×D\n2N(3)\nwhere:\nG = 1 for an output range of 0 V to VREF or G = 2 for an output\nrange of 0 V to 2 × VREF.\nVREF is the voltage on the VREF pin.\nD is the decimal equivalent of the binary code (0 to 4095) that is\nloaded to the DAC register.\nN = 12.\nResistor String\nThe simplified segmented resistor string DAC structure is shown\nin Figure 32 . The code loaded to the DAC register determines the\nswitch on the string that is connected to the output buffer.\nBecause each resistance in the string has the same value, R, the\nstring DAC is guaranteed monotonic.Figure 32. Resistor String\nDAC Output Buffer\nThe output buffer is designed as an input/output rail-to-rail buffer.\nThe output buffer can drive 2 nF capacitance with a 1 k Ω resistor\nin parallel. The slew rate is 1.25 V/µs with a ¼ to ¾ scale settling\ntime of 6 µs. By default, the DAC outputs update directly after data\nhas been written to the input register. The LDAC register delays the\nupdates until additional channels have been written to if required.\nSee the LDAC Mode Operation  section for more information.\nDAC Output Range\nThe DAC output voltage range can be configured to 0 V to VREF\n(gain = 1) or 0 V to 2 × VREF (gain = 2) using DAC range bit of the\ngeneral-purpose control register, as shown in Figure 33  and Figure\n34, respectively. When VREF = VDD, the 0 V to 2 × VREF range does\nnot allow the DAC to swing the output beyond VDD.\nFigure 33. Output Voltage Range of the DAC with Gain = 1 (Unloaded\nCondition)\nData Sheet AD5593R\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. H | 18 of 47Figure 34. Output Voltage Range of the DAC with Gain = 2 (Unloaded\nCondition)\nWhen VREF = VDD for gain = 1 or VREF = 0.5 × VDD for gain = 2,\nthere is an upper dead band of 10 mV at the DAC channel output\nin unloaded conditions. Additionally, there is a lower dead band of\n~4.88 mV at the DAC channel output in unloaded conditions. When\ndrawing a load current at either rail, the output voltage headroom\nwith respect to that rail is limited by the 25 Ω typical channel\nresistance of the DAC channel. For example, when sinking 1 mA,\nthe minimum output voltage = 25 Ω × 1 mA = 25 mV.\nADC SECTION\nThe ADC section is a fast, 12-bit, single-supply ADC with a conver-\nsion time of 2 µs. The ADC is preceded by a multiplexer that\nswitches selected I/O pins to the ADC. A sequencer is included\nto switch the multiplexer to the next selected channel automatical-\nly. Channels are selected for conversion by writing to the ADC\nsequence register. When the write to the ADC sequence register\nhas completed, the first channel in the conversion sequence is\nput into track mode. Each channel can track the input signal for a\nminimum of 500 ns. The conversion is initiated on the rising edge\nof the clock for the acknowledge (ACK) that occurs after the slave\naddress (see Figure 39 ).\nEach conversion takes 2 µs. The ADC has a range bit (ADC range\nselect in the general-purpose control register, see Bit 5 in Table 19 )\nthat sets the input range as 0 V to VREF or 0 V to 2 × VREF. All input\nchannels share the same range. The output coding of the ADC is\nstraight binary. It is possible to set each I/Ox pin as both a DAC and\nan ADC. In this case, the primary function is that of the DAC. If the\npin is selected for inclusion in an ADC conversion sequence, the\nvoltage on the pin is converted and made available via the serial\ninterface. This allows the DAC voltage to be monitored.Calculating ADC Input Current\nThe current flowing into the I/Ox pins configured as ADC inputs\nvaries with sampling rate (fS), the voltage difference between\nsuccessive channels (VDIFF), and whether buffered or unbuffered\nmode is used. Figure 35  shows a simplified version of the ADC\ninput structure. When a new channel is selected for conversion,\n5.8 pF must be charged to or discharged from the voltage that on\nthe previously selected channel. The time required for the charge\nor discharge depends on the voltage difference between the two\nchannels. This dependence affects the input impedance of the\nmultiplexer and, therefore, the input current flowing into the I/Ox\npins.\nIn buffered mode, Switch S1 is open and Switch S2 is closed. In\nbuffered mode, the U1 buffer directly drives the 23.1 pF capacitor\nand the charging time of the capacitors is negligible. In unbuffered\nmode, Switch S1 is closed and Switch S2 is closed. In unbuffered\nmode, the 23.1 pF capacitor must be charged from the I/Ox pins;\nthis charging contributes to the input current. For applications\nwhere the ADC input current is too high, an external input buffer\nmay be required. The choice of buffer is a function of the particular\napplication.\nCalculate the input current for buffered mode as follows:\nfS × C × VDIFF + 1 nA\nwhere:\nfS is the ADC sample rate in Hz.\nC is the sampling capacitance in farads.\nVDIFF is the voltage change between successive channels.\nCalculate the input current for buffered mode as follows:\nfS × C × VDIFF\nwhere 1 nA is the dc leakage current associated with unbuffered\nmode.\nThe input current for the ADC in buffered mode, where I/O0 = 0.5 V,\nI/O1 = 2 V, and fS = 10 kHz, is as follows:\n(10,000 × 5.8 × 10−12 × 1.5) + 1 nA = 88 nA\nUnder the same conditions, the ADC input current in unbuffered\nmode is as follows:\n(10,000 × 28.9 × 10−12 × 1.5) = 433.5 nA\nData Sheet AD5593R\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. H | 19 of 47Figure 35. ADC Input Structure\nGPIO SECTION\nEach of the eight I/Ox pins can be configured as a general-purpose\ndigital input by programming the GPIO read configuration register\nor output pin by programming the GPIO write configuration register.\nWhen an I/Ox pin is configured as an output, the pin can be set\nhigh or low by programming the GPIO write data register. Logic\nlevels for general-purpose outputs are relative to VDD and GND.\nWhen an I/Ox pin is configured as an input, its status can be\ndetermined by setting the pointer byte to 0b01100000. When an\nI/Ox pin is set as an output, it is possible to read its status by also\nsetting it as an input pin. When reading the status of the I/Ox pins\nset as inputs the status of an I/Ox pin set as both and input and\noutput pin is also returned.\nINTERNAL REFERENCE\nThe AD5593R  contains an on-chip 2.5 V reference. The reference\nis powered down by default and is enabled by setting Bit 9 in the\npower-down/reference control register to 1. When the on-chip refer-\nence is powered up, the reference voltage appears on the VREF pin\nand may be used as a reference source for other components.\nWhen the internal reference is used, it is recommended to decouple\nVREF to GND using a 100 nF capacitor. It is recommended that\nthe internal reference be buffered before using it elsewhere in\nthe system. When the reference is powered down, an external\nreference must be connected to VREF. Suitable external reference\nsources for the AD5593R  include the AD780 , AD1582 , ADR431 ,\nREF193 , and ADR391 .\nRESET FUNCTION\nThe AD5593R  has an asynchronous RESET  pin. For normal oper-\nation, RESET  is tied high. A falling edge on RESET  resets all\nregisters to their default values and reconfigures the I/O pins to\ntheir default values (85 k Ω pull-down resistor to GND). The reset\nfunction takes 250 µs maximum; do not write new data to theAD5593R  during this time. The AD5593R  has a software reset that\nperforms the same function as the RESET  pin. The reset function is\nactivated by writing 0x0F to the pointer byte and 0x0D and 0xAC to\nthe most significant and least significant bytes of the software reset\nregister, respectively.\nTEMPERATURE INDICATOR\nThe AD5593R  contains an integrated temperature indicator that\ncan be read to provide an estimation of the die temperature. This\ncan be used in fault detection where a sudden rise in die temper-\nature may indicate a fault condition, such as a shorted output.\nTemperature readback is enabled by setting Bit 8 in the ADC\nsequence register. The temperature result is then added to the ADC\nsequence. The temperature result has an address of 0b1000 (see\nTable 34 ) and care must be taken that this result is not confused\nwith the readback from DAC0 (see Table 32 ). The temperature\nconversion takes 5 µs with the ADC buffer enabled and 20 µs when\nthe buffer is disabled. Calculate the temperature using the following\nformulae:\nFor ADC gain = 1,\nTemperature  (°C) = 25 +AD C Co d e − 0.5 / V RE F × 4095\n2.654 × 2.5 / V REF\nFor ADC gain = 2,\nTemperature  (°C) =\n25 +A DC C o de − 0.5 / 2 × V REF × 4095\n1.327 × 2.5 / V RE F\nThe range of codes returned by the ADC when reading from the\ntemperature indicator is approximately 645 to 1035, (for ADC gain\n= 1) corresponding to a temperature between −40°C and +105°C.\nThe accuracy of the temperature indicator is typically 3°C when\naveraged over five samples.\nData Sheet AD5593R\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 20 of 47The AD5593R  has a 2-wire, I2C-compatible serial interface (refer\nto The I2C -Bus Specification , Version 2.1, January 2000). The\nAD5593R  is connected to an I2C bus as a slave device under the\ncontrol of a master device. See Figure 2  for a timing diagram of\na typical write sequence. The AD5593R  supports standard mode\n(100 kHz) and fast mode (400 kHz). Support is not provided for\n10-bit addressing and general call addressing. The AD5593R  has a\n7-bit slave address; its six MSBs are set to 001000. The LSB is set\nby the state of the A0 address pin, which determines the state of\nthe A0 bit. The facility to change the logic level of the A0 pin before\na read or write operation allows the user to incorporate multiple\nAD5593R  devices on one bus.\nThe 2-wire serial bus protocol operates as follows: the master\ninitiates data transfer by establishing a start condition when a\nhigh-to-low transition on the SDA line occurs while SCL is high.\nThe following byte is the address byte, which consists of the 7-bit\nslave address. The slave address corresponding to the transmitted\naddress responds by pulling SDA low during the ninth clock pulse\n(this is termed the acknowledge bit). At this stage, all other devices\non the bus remain idle while the selected device waits for data to be\nwritten to or read from its shift register.\nData is transmitted over the serial bus in sequences of nine clock\npulses (eight data bits followed by an acknowledge bit). The transi-tions on the SDA line must occur during the low period of SCL and\nremain stable during the high period of SCL. When all data bits\nhave been read or written, a stop condition is established.\nIn write mode, the master pulls the SDA line high during the 10th\nclock pulse to establish a stop condition. In read mode, the master\nissues a no acknowledge for the ninth clock pulse (that is, the\nSDA line remains high). The master brings the SDA line low before\nthe 10th clock pulse and then high during the 10th clock pulse to\nestablish a stop condition.\nWRITE OPERATION\nWhen writing to the AD5593R , the user must begin with a start\ncommand followed by an address byte R/ W = 0), after which the\nAD5593R  acknowledges that it is prepared to receive data by\npulling SDA low. The AD5593R  requires three bytes of data. The\nfirst byte is the pointer byte. This byte contains information defining\nthe type of operation that is required of the AD5593R , such as\nconfiguring the I/O pins and writing to a DAC. The pointer byte is\nfollowed by the most significant byte and the least significant byte,\nas shown in Figure 36 . After these data bytes are acknowledged by\nthe AD5593R , a stop condition follows.\nFigure 36. 4-Byte I2C Write\nData Sheet AD5593R\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 21 of 47READ OPERATION\nWhen reading data back from the AD5593R , the user begins with a\nstart command followed by an address byte (R/ W = 0), after which\nthe AD5593R  acknowledges that it is prepared to transmit data by\npulling SDA low. The pointer byte is then written to select what is\nto be read back. A repeat start or a new I2C transmission can thenfollow to read two bytes of data from the AD5593R . Both bytes are\nacknowledged by the master, as shown in Figure 37 .\nIt is also possible to perform consecutive readbacks without having\nto provide interim start and stop conditions or slave addresses. This\nmethod can be used to read blocks of conversions from the ADC,\nas shown in Figure 39 .\nFigure 37. Read One 16-Bit Word\nFigure 38. Read One 16-Bit Word, Maintain Control of the Bus\nData Sheet AD5593R\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 22 of 47Figure 39. I2C Block Read\nPOINTER BYTE\nThe pointer byte contains eight bits. Bits[7:4] are mode bits that\nselect the operation to be executed. The data contained in Bits[3:0]\ndepend on the operation required. Table 8  and Table 9  show\nthe configuration of the pointer byte. When Bits[7:4] are 0b0000,\nthe mode dependent bits (Bits[3:0]) select a control register (see\nTable 10 ) to write data to. The data written to a control register is\ncontained in the MSB and LSB as shown in Figure 36 . The mode\ndependent data bits also select which DAC is updated during a\nDAC write operation and which register is selected for readback.\nCONTROL REGISTERS\nTable 11  shows the control register map for the AD5593R . The\ncontrol registers configure the I/O pins and set various operating\nparameters in the AD5593R , such as enabling the reference, se-\nlecting the LDAC mode function, or selecting power-down modes.\nThe control registers are written to using the 4-byte I2C write se-\nquence shown in Figure 36 . To write to a control register, the mode\nbits (Bits[7:4]) of the pointer byte are zeros. The mode dependent\ndata bits (Bits[3:0]) of the pointer byte select which control register\nis to be accessed. The data to be written to the control register is\ncontained in the most significant and least significant data bytes.\nThese contain a total of 16 bits and are shown as Bits[15:0] in\nthe Register Details: AD5593R Control Register Map  section. The\ncontents of the control registers can be read back using the read\nsequence shown in Figure 37  or Figure 38 .GENERAL-PURPOSE CONTROL REGISTER\nThe general-purpose control register enables or disables certain\nfunctions associated with the DAC, ADC, and I/O pin configuration\n(see Table 19 ). The register sets the output range of the DAC\nand input range of the ADC, which sets their transfer functions, en-\nables/disables the ADC buffer, and enables the precharge function\n(see the ADC Section  section for more details). The register is also\nused to lock the I/O pin configuration to prevent accidental change.\nWhen Bit 7 is set to 1, writes to the configuration registers are\nignored.\nCONFIGURING THE AD5593R\nThe AD5593R  I/O pins are configured by writing to a series of pin\nconfiguration registers. The control registers are accessed when\nBits[7:4] of the pointer byte are 0b0000. Bits[3:0] determine which\nregister is accessed as shown in Table 11 .\nOn power-up, the I/O pins are configured as 85 k Ω resistors\nconnected to GND. The I/O channels of the AD5593R  can be\nconfigured to operate as DAC outputs, ADC inputs, digital outputs,\ndigital inputs, three-state, or connected to GND with 85 k Ω pull-\ndown resistors. When configured as digital outputs, the pins have\nthe additional option of being configured as push/pull or open-drain.\nThe I/O channels are configured by writing to the appropriate\nconfiguration registers, as shown in Table 11 . To assign a particular\nfunction for an I/O channel, write to the appropriate register and\nData Sheet AD5593R\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 23 of 47set the corresponding bit to 1. For example, setting Bit 0 in the\nDAC pin configuration register configures I/O0 as a DAC. In the\nevent that the bit for an I/O channel is set in multiple configuration\nregisters, the I/O channel adopts the function dictated by the last\nwrite operation.\nThe exceptions to this rule are that an I/Ox pin can be set as both\na DAC and ADC or as a digital input and output. When an I/Ox pin\nis configured as a DAC and ADC, the primary function is as a DAC\nand the ADC can be used to measure the voltage being provided\nby the DAC. This feature can be used to monitor the output voltage\nto detect short circuits or overload conditions. Figure 40  shows\nan example of how to configure I/O1 and I/O7 as DACs. When\na pin is configured as both a general-purpose input and output,the primary function is as an output pin. This configuration allows\nthe status of the output pin to be determined by programming the\nGPIO read configuration register and then setting the pointer byte\nto 0b01100000.\nThe general-purpose control register contains a lock configuration\nbit. When the lock configuration bit is set to 1, any writes to the pin\nconfiguration registers are ignored, thus preventing the function of\nthe I/O pins from being changed.\nThe I/O pins can be reconfigured any time when the AD5593R  is in\nan idle state, that is, no ADC conversions are taking place and no\nregisters are being read back. The lock configuration bit must also\nbe set to 0.\nFigure 40. Configuring I/O1 and I/O7 as DACs\nData Sheet AD5593R\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 24 of 47DAC WRITE OPERATION\nData is written to a DAC when the mode bits (Bits[7:4]) of the\npointer byte are 0b0001 (see Table 8 ). Bits[2:0] determine which\nDAC is addressed (see Table 12 ). Data to be written to the DAC\nis contained in the MSB and LSB, as shown in Table 31 . Data is\nwritten to the selected DAC input register. Data written to the input\nregister can be automatically copied to the DAC register, if required.\nData is transferred to the DAC register based on the setting of the\nLDAC mode register (see Table 23 ).\nLDAC Mode Operation\nThe transfer of data from an input register to a DAC register is\ncontrolled by Bits[1:0] of the LDAC mode register (pointer byte\n= 0b00000111). When the LDAC mode bits (Bits[1:0]) are set to\n00, new data is automatically transferred from the input register to\nthe DAC register and the analog output updates. When the LDAC\nmode bits are set to 01, data remains in the input register. This\nallows writes to input registers without affecting the analog outputs.\nAfter loading the input registers with the desired values and settingthe LDAC mode bits to 10, the values in the input registers transfer\nto the DAC registers and the analog outputs update simultaneously.\nThe LDAC mode bits then revert to 01.\nDAC READBACK\nThe input register of each DAC can be read back via the I2C inter-\nface. This can be useful to confirm that the data was received cor-\nrectly before writing to the LDAC mode register or simply checking\nwhat value was last loaded to a DAC. Data can be read back from\na DAC only when no ADC conversion sequence is taking place. A\nDAC input register can be read back using the sequence shown in\nFigure 37  or Figure 38 . The mode dependent bits, Bits[3:0], of the\nDAC readback mode register (pointer byte = 0b0101XXXX), select\nwhich DAC input register is to be read back (see Table 14 ). When\nthe DAC register is read back as shown in Table 32 , the MSB of the\nmost significant data byte is a 1 to indicate that the result is a DAC\nregister. The next three bits (Bits[14:12]) contain the DAC register\naddress (see Table 32 ) and Bits[11:0] contain the DAC register\nvalue. Figure 41  shows an example of reading the input register of\nDAC2.\nFigure 41. DAC Input Register Readback\nData Sheet AD5593R\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 25 of 47ADC OPERATION\nThe ADC channels of the AD5593R  operate as a traditional multi-\nchannel ADC, where each serial transfer selects the next channel\nfor conversion. The user must write to the ADC pin configuration\nregister (see Table 20 ) to select the input channels as ADC inputs\nto be included in the conversion sequence before initiating any\nconversions. This is done using the I2C write sequence shown in\nFigure 36 . When writing to the ADC sequence register (see Table\n18), select which channels are to be converted in sequence. The\nuser can also set the REP bit to have the ADC repeat conversions\nin the sequence.\nWhen the sequence register has been written to, the ADC begins\nto track the first channel in the sequence. ADC data can be read\nfrom the AD5593R  using any of the three read operations shown in\nFigure 37 , Figure 38 , and Figure 39 , with the I2C block read ( Figure\n39) being the most efficient.\nIf more than one channel is selected in the ADC sequence register,\nthe ADC converts all selected channels sequentially in ascending\norder. Conversion is started by the rising edge of SCL at the\nacknowledge (ACK) preceding the MSB (see Figure 39 ).\nIf the REP bit is set after all of the selected channels in the\nsequence register have been converted, the ADC repeats thesequence. If the REP bit is clear, the ADC clocks out the last result\non subsequent I2C reads. When ADC data is clocked out by the\nserial interface, Bit 15 = 0 to indicate that the result is ADC data.\nBits[14:12] contain a 3-bit address to indicate which ADC the data\nis coming from, and Bits[11:0] contain the 12-bit ADC result (see\nTable 33 ).\nFigure 42  shows how to configure the AD5593R  to perform ADC\nconversions. In Step 1, I/O7 and I/O0 are configured as ADCs.\nStep 2 writes to the ADC sequence register, sets the REP bit, and\nselects ADC7 and ADC0 for inclusion in the conversion sequence.\nStep 3 selects the ADCs for reading and Step 4 begins reading the\nADC results (see Table 33 ). The conversions are repeated until a\nstop condition is given by the controller.\nThe ADC sequence can be changed by writing the new sequence\nto the ADC sequence register when conversions are not taking\nplace. When a new sequence is written, any channels remaining to\nbe converted from the earlier sequence are ignored and the ADC\nstarts converting the first channel of the new sequence.\nTo stop the ADC conversion sequence, clear the REP, TEMP, and\nADC7 to ADC0 bits in the ADC sequence register to 0.\nFigure 42. Configuring the ADC for Conversion\nData Sheet AD5593R\nSERIAL INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. H | 26 of 47GPIO OPERATION\nEach of the I/Ox pins of the AD5593R  can be configured to operate\nas a general-purpose, digital input or output pin. The function of\nthe pins is determined by writing to the appropriate bit in the GPIO\nread configuration register and the GPIO write configuration register\nusing the 4-byte I2C write shown in Figure 36 .\nSetting Pins as Outputs\nTo set a pin as a general-purpose output, set the appropriate bit in\nthe GPIO write configuration register (pointer byte = 0b00001000)\nto 1. For example, setting Bit 0 to 1 enables I/O0 as a general-pur-\npose output.\nThe outputs can be independently configured as push/pull or open-\ndrain outputs. When in push/pull configuration, the output is driven\nto VDD or GND as determined by the data in the GPIO write\ndata register (pointer byte = 0b00001001). When in open-drain\nconfiguration (pointer byte = 0b00001100), the output is driven to\nGND when a data bit in the GPIO write data register sets the pin\nlow. When the pin is set high, the output is not driven and must be\npulled high by an external resistor. This allows multiple output pins\nto be tied together. If all the pins are normally high, it allows one pin\nto pull down the others. This is commonly used where multiple pins\nare used to trigger an alarm or interrupt pin. The state of the output\npin is controlled by setting or clearing the bits in the GPIO write\ndata register (pointer byte = 0b00001001). A data bit is ignored if it\nis written to a location that is not configured as an output.\nSetting Pins as Inputs\nTo set an I/Ox pin as a general-purpose input, set the appropri-\nate bit in the GPIO read configuration register (pointer byte =\n0b00001010) to 1. For example, setting Bit 0 to 1 enables I/O0 as a\ngeneral-purpose input. To read the state of general-purpose inputs,\nset the pointer byte to 0b01100000 (see Table 9 ) using any of the\nread operations shown in Figure 37 , Figure 38 , and Figure 39 . The\nstatus of any I/O pin set as a general-purpose input appears in the\nappropriate bit location in the least significant data byte.\nTHREE-STATE PINS\nThe I/Ox pins can be set to three-state by writing to the three-state\nconfiguration register (pointer byte = 0b00001101) as shown in\nTable 29 .85 KΩ PULL-DOWN PINS\nThe I/Ox pins can be connected to GND via a pull-down resistor\n(85 kΩ) by setting the appropriate bits in the pull-down configuration\nregister (pointer byte = 0b00000110) as shown in Table 22 .\nPOWER-DOWN/REFERENCE CONTROL\nThe AD5593R  has a power-down/reference control register (pointer\nbyte = 0b00001011) that reduces the power consumption when\ncertain functions are not needed. The power-down register allows\nany channels set as DACs to be placed in a power-down state\nindividually. When in power-down, the DAC outputs are three-stat-\ned. When a DAC channel is returned into normal mode, the DAC\noutput returns to its previous value. The internal reference and its\nbuffer are powered down by default and are enabled by setting\nthe EN_REF bit in the power-down/reference control register. The\ninternal reference voltage then appears at the VREF pin.\nThere is no dedicated power-down function for the ADC, but the\nADC is automatically powered down if none of the I/Ox pins are\nselected as ADCs. The ADC powers up if a read of the tempera-\nture indicator is initiated. The PD_ALL bit powers down all the\nDACs, the reference, its buffer, and the ADC. The PD_ALL bit also\noverrides the settings of Bits[9:0]. Table 27  shows the power-down\nregister.\nRESET FUNCTION\nThe AD5593R  can be reset to its default conditions by writing\n0x0DAC to the software reset register (pointer byte = 0b00001111).\nThis resets all registers to their default values and reconfigures the\nI/Ox pins to their default values (85 k Ω pull-down to GND). The\nreset function is triggered on the SCL falling edge of the eighth bit\nof the least significant byte (Bit 0 of Frame 4 in Figure 36 ), and the\nAD5593R  does not generate an ACK signal for this byte of data.\nThe AD5593R  has a RESET  pin that performs the same function.\nFor normal operation, RESET  is tied high. A falling edge on RESET\ntriggers the reset function. Both the hardware and the software\nreset functions take 250 µs maximum and there must be no activity\non the SCL pin of the AD5593R  during this time.\nData Sheet AD5593R\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev.

The communications channel requires a\n2-wire interface consisting of a clock signal and a data signal.\nAD5593R TO ADSP-BF537 INTERFACE\nThe I2C interface of the AD5593R  is designed to be easily con-\nnected to industry-standard DSPs and microcontrollers. Figure 43\nshows the AD5593R  connected to the Analog Devices Blackfin®\nDSP. The Blackfin has an integrated I2C port that can be connected\ndirectly to the I2C pins of the AD5593R .\nFigure 43. ADSP-BF537 InterfaceLAYOUT GUIDELINES\nIn any circuit where accuracy is important, careful consideration\nof the power supply and ground return layout helps to ensure the\nrated performance. The printed circuit board (PCB) on which the\nAD5593R  is mounted must be designed so that the AD5593R  lies\non the analog plane.\nThe AD5593R  must have ample supply bypassing of 10 µF in\nparallel with 0.1 µF on each supply, located as close to the pack-\nage as possible, ideally right up against the device. The 10 µF\ncapacitors are the tantalum bead type. The 0.1 µF capacitor must\nhave low effective series resistance (ESR) and low effective series\ninductance (ESI) such as the common ceramic types, which provide\na low impedance path to ground at high frequencies to handle\ntransient currents due to internal logic switching.\nData Sheet AD5593R\nREGISTER MAP\nanalog.com Rev.
