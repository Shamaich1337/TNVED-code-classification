It has large currents flowing through it and should be\nconnected to a good quality ground plane.\nCOL A, COL B (Pins 3, 14):  These are the open collectors\nof the output power switches. They are connected to the\nouter terminals of the center tap transformer. Large cur-rents flow into these pins so external traces should be kept\nas short as possible.\nR\nSL (Pin 4):  The slew control resistor sets the maximum\ncurrent and voltage slew rate for the collectors A and B.\nThe minimum resistor value is 3.4k for fast slewing and the\nmaximum resistor is 34k for slow slewing.

R\nT and C T should be set\nsuch that the oscillator clock frequency is approximately\n10% below the external clock frequency. If unused, thispin should be tied to GND. For more details, see “Oscillator\nSync” in the Applications Information section of this data\nsheet.\nCT (Pin 6): The oscillator capacitor pin is used in conjunc-\ntion with the R T pin to set the oscillator frequency. For\nRT = 16.9k, C T can be calculated as follows:\nCT(nF) = 70/f OSC(kHz)\nThe transformer operating frequency and the frequency\nof each output is one half of the frequency of the oscillator.RT (Pin 7): The oscillator resistor pin is used to set the\ncharge and discharge currents of the oscillator capacitor.\nThe nominal value is 16.9k.

Grounding this pin will disable all internal circuitry.\nIncreasing the SHDN voltage above the turn-on thresholdwill enable the part. At the turn-on threshold, approxi-\nmately 20 mA of current is sourced out of the pin. This\ncurrent, in conjunction with the Thevenin resistance on thepin, sets up the hysteresis. This allows the user to set the\nundervoltage lockout (UVLO) of the supply and the amount\nof start-up hysteresis with a resistor divider off of the inputvoltage.  Above 2.1V on the SHDN pin, the hysteresis\ncurrent is reduced to zero. If unused the pin can be left\nfloating or tied directly to the input voltage.\nGND (Pin 10):  Signal Ground.

The two switches are\nturned on out of phase at 50% duty cycles. During theswitch on time, V\nIN is applied across the primary side of\nthe transformer. The voltage on the secondary side of the\ntransformer is simply V IN times the turns ratio. The diodes\nrectify the secondary voltage and generate the output\nvoltage. The output capacitor is for hold-up and filtering.\nSome of the topology’s advantages are: 1) Stepping up or\ndown the input voltage can easily be done by setting the\nturns ratio. 2) The transformer provides isolation between\nthe input and output. 3) Each switch cycle applies V IN\nacross the transformer in opposite polarities. Therefore,\nthe transformer core never saturates and a separate reset\ncircuit is not necessary.\nThe push-pull topology is not without its concerns. An\nimbalance in the two sides of the transformer caneventually cause the transformer to saturate. Also, dur-\ning the turn-off of the switches, the leakage inductance\ncauses a large undesirable voltage spike. The LT3439slew control feature addresses both of these concerns\nand is discussed in the Applications Information section.\nSlew Control\nControl of voltage and current slew rate is maintained via\ntwo feedback loops. One loop controls the output switch\ncollector voltage dV/dt and the other loop controls theemitter current dI/dt. Output slew control is achieved by\ncomparing the two currents generated by these slewing\nevents to a current set by the external resistor R\nSL. The two\ncontrol loops work together to provide a smooth transition\nfrom voltage slew control to current slew control.\nInternal Regulator\nMost of the control circuitry operates from an internal 2.4V\nlow dropout regulator that is powered from V IN.  VIN can\n6LT3439\nsn3439 3439fsvary from 2.8V to 17.5V with very little change in device\nperformance. When the part is in shutdown mode, the\ninternal regulator is turned off, drawing less than 20 mA of\ncurrent from V IN.\nOvercurrent Protection\nA linearly controlled current limit circuit is provided to\nprotect the circuit from excessive currents and to facilitatestart-up into a highly capacitive load. Upon reaching cur-\nrent limit, the switching cycle is not terminated, instead the\nbase drive to the output transistor is regulated to maintainthe maximum current over the entire switch cycle. Very high\npower dissipation in the switches occurs during this mode\nof operation. If the current limit is enabled for a long enoughperiod of time, over temperature protection shutdown will\nbe enabled to protect the device.OPERATIOU\nOvertemperature Protection\nWhen the IC has exceeded the maximum temperature the\npart will trigger the overtemperature protection circuit\nwhere both output drivers are turned off.\nUndervoltage Lockout Protection\nWhen V IN is below 2.55V the part will go into undervoltage\nlockout mode where both output drivers are turned off.\nNo Load Operation\nThe operation of the supply is stable all the way down to\nzero load and a preload is not required.\nAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nReducing EMI from switching power supplies has tradi-\ntionally invoked fear in designers. Many switchers aredesigned solely on efficiency and, as such, produce wave-\nforms filled with high frequency harmonics that propagate\nthrough the rest of the supply.\nThe LT3439 provides control of two of the primary vari-\nables for controlling EMI while switching inductive loads:\nswitch voltage slew rate and switch current slew rate. Theuse of this part will reduce noise and EMI over conven-\ntional switch mode controllers. Because these variables\nare under control, a supply built with this part will exhibitfar less tendency to create EMI and less chance of running\ninto problems during production.\nIt is beyond the scope of this data sheet to get into EMI\nfundamentals. AN70, “A Monolithic Switching Regulator\nwith 100mV Output Noise” contains much information\nconcerning noise in switching regulators and should beconsulted.\nOscillator Frequency\nThe internal oscillator generates the switching frequency\nthat determines the fundamental positioning of theharmonics. Using quality external components is impor-\ntant to ensure oscillator frequency stability. A currentdefined by external resistor R\nT charges and discharges\nthe capacitor C T creating a saw tooth waveform where the\noutputs’ states change at the peak. The frequency of eachoutput is one half of the frequency of the oscillator.\nBy having both components external, the user has greaterflexibility in setting the frequency and the frequency is lesssusceptible to any temperature variations in the device.\nThe external capacitance C\nT is chosen by:\nCT(nF) = 1183/[f OSC(kHz) • R T(kW)]\nwhere f OSC is the desired oscillator frequency.\nFor R T equal to 16.9k, this simplifies to:\nCT(nF) = 70/f OSC(kHz)\ne.g., C T = 1nF for f OSC = 70kHz\nNominally, R T should be set to 16.9k.\nLow tolerance and low temperature coefficient compo-\nnents are recommended.\n7LT3439\nsn3439 3439fsOscillator SYNC\nThe oscillator can be synchronized to an external clock.\nSet the RC timing components for an oscillator frequency\n10% below the desired sync frequency.\nIt is recommended that the SYNC pin be driven with a\nsquare wave that has an amplitude greater than 2V, a pulse\nwidth greater than 1 ms and a rise time less than 500ns. The\nrising edge of the sync waveform triggers the change in\nthe state of the outputs.\nSlew Rate Setting\nSetting the LT3439 maximum slew rate is easy. The\nexternal resistor to ground on the R SL pin sets the maxi-\nmum slew rate. To determine the maximum slew rateconnect a 50k resistor pot with a 3.4k series resistance to\nthe R\nSL pin. Start at the lowest resistance setting and\nincrease the pot until the noise level meets your require-ments. Note that slower slewing waveforms will lower the\npower supply efficiency. Consult Linear Technology Appli-\ncation Note 70, “A Monolithic Switching Regulator with100mV Output Noise” for recommended noise measure-\nment techniques.\nShutdown\nThe SHDN pin is used to shut down the part. Grounding\nthis pin will disable all internal circuitry.\nIncreasing the SHDN voltage above the turn-on threshold,\napproximately 1.3V, will enable the part. At the turn-on\nthreshold approximately 20 mA of current is sourced out of\nthe pin. This current, in conjunction with the Theveninresistance on the pin, sets up the amount of hysteresis.\nThis allows the user to set the turn-on voltage of the supply\nand the start-up hysteresis with a resistor divider. Thehysteresis can be used to prevent the part from shutting\ndown due to input voltage sag from an initial high current\ndraw. When the SHDN pin is greater than 2.1V, thehysteresis current is reduced to zero.\nIn addition to the current hysteresis, there is also approxi-\nmately 35mV of voltage hysteresis on the SHDN pin.\nIf a resistor divider is used to set the turn on threshold the\nresistors are determined by the following equations:APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nVRR\nRV ONAB\nBSHDN=+æ\nŁçö\nł÷·\nSHDNRA\nRB\n3439 AI01VIN\nVON is the input voltage at which the supply will turn on and\nVSHDN is the SHDN pin turn-on threshold, typically 1.3V.\nVRV\nRRI HYST ASHDN\nABSHDN=D+æ\nŁçö\nł÷ ·||\nVHYST is the actual hysteresis voltage seen at the input\nvoltage.

Lower slew rates\n8LT3439\nsn3439 3439fsAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nmean greater switching losses in the internal output\nswitches. However, efficiency is only modestly reduced\nfor a large improvement in EMI.\nCare should be taken to ensure that the worst-case input\nvoltage and load current conditions do not cause an\nexcessive die temperature. The total power dissipation of\nthe IC is dominated by three loss terms, regulator losses,saturation losses and switching losses. The following\nformulas may be used to approximate these losses:\n1.

Die junction temperature can be computed as\nfollows:\nTJ = TAMB + (P D)(qJA)\nwhere T AMB is the ambient temperature, T J is the junction\ntemperature and qJA is the thermal resistance from junc-\ntion to ambient.\nThe LT3439 comes in the 16-pin TSSOP with exposed\nbackside package that has a very low junction-to-ambientthermal resistance ( q\nJA) of approximately 40 °C/W.\nTransformer Design\nTable 1 lists recommended center tapped transformers for\na variety of input voltage, output voltage and power\ncombinations.These transformers will yield slightly high output voltages\nso that they can accommodate an LDO regulator on the\noutput.\nIf your application is not listed, the LTC Applications group\nis available to assist in the choice and/or the design of the\ntransformer.\nIn the design/selection of the transformer the following\ncharacteristics are critical and should be considered.\nTurns Ratio\nThe turns ratio of the transformer determines the output\nvoltage. The following equation can be used as a first pass\nto calculate the turns ratio:\nN\nNVV\nVVS\nPOUT F\nIN SW=+\n±\nwhere V F is the forward voltage of the output diode and\nVSW is the voltage drop across the internal switches (see\nTypical Performance curves).\nSufficient margin should be added to the turns ratio to\naccount for voltage drops due to transformer winding\nresistances. Also, if using an LDO for regulating the output\nvoltage, don’t forget to take into account the voltage dropthat should be added to V\nOUT.\nMagnetizing Current\nThe primary inductance of the transformer causes a ripple\ncurrent that is independent of load current. The ripple\ncurrent manifests itself in the output voltage through the\nparasitic resistances of the supply. Increasing the trans-former magnetizing inductance can reduce the rippleTable 1\nNOMINAL NOMINAL\nINPUT OUTPUT OUTPUT COILTRONICS\nVOLTAGE VOLTAGE POWER PART NUMBER\n5V 12V 1.5W CTX02-13716-X1\n5V 12V 3.0W CTX02-13665-X1\n5V –15V 1.5W CTX02-13713-X1\n5V –15V 3.0W CTX02-13664-X1\n5V 12V 1.5W CTX02-13834-X3\n5V 12V 10W CTX02-13949-X1\n12V –12V 6W CTX02-16076\n9LT3439\nsn3439 3439fsAPPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\ncurrent. This can be accomplished by adding more turns\nonto a given core or selecting a new core with a higher\ninductance per turn squared characteristic (A L).\nThe following equation can be used to set the transformer\nprimary inductance:\nLVt\nIPRI INON=D\ntON can be calculated by 1/f OSC.\nDI is somewhat arbitrary but a general rule of thumb is to\nset it between 10% to 30% of I PRI where I PRI is calculated\nas follows:\nIVI\nV EffPRIOUT OUT\nIN=·\nEff can be estimated at 70%.\nWinding Resistance\nResistance in either the primary or secondary winding will\nreduce overall efficiency and degrade load regulation. Ifefficiency or load regulation is unsatisfactory, verify that\nthe voltage drops in the transformer windings are not\nexcessive.\nLeakage Inductance\nWhen the output switches turn off, the transformer leak-\nage inductance causes a voltage spike on the outputswitch collector. The size of the voltage spike is propor-\ntional to the magnitude of the leakage inductance and to\nthe square of the load current (energy stored in the leakageinductance). The voltage spike should be limited so that it\ndoes not exceed the voltage breakdown of the output\nswitches. This can be accomplished by reducing thetransformer’s leakage inductance or by reducing the maxi-\nmum slew rate. The voltage slew control will limit the\nvoltage spike by dissipating the leakage energy in thepower switches.\nTransformer Imbalance\nA common concern for the push-pull topology is trans-\nformer imbalance. If the volt/second products of each halfof the switching cycle do not match, the transformer’s flux\nlevel walks up the BH curve and the transformer goes into\nsaturation. This is undesirable because the effective mag-\nnetizing inductance drops off and the magnetizing currentincreases rapidly. Fortunately, there are parasitics in the\ncircuit that counteract the transformer saturation. When\nthe transformer begins to saturate the magnetizing cur-rent increases in one half of the switching cycle and\ntherefore, the IR drops increase thereby reducing the volt/\nsecond product of that half cycle. The transformer balanceis maintained. Also, the losses in the transformer and the\nmain switches have positive temperature coefficients elimi-\nnating the potential for thermal runaway. The LT3439 cancompensate for small circuit imbalances, however care\nshould be taken to balance both sides of the circuit\nincluding transformer design and PCB layout.\nTransformer Design Example\nThe following is an example of the design of a DC trans-\nformer for a 5V to 5V at 500mA supply.\nSupply specs: V\nIN = 5V, V OUT = 5V, I OUT = 500mA,\nfOSC = 100kHz\nAssume: V F = 0.5V (forward voltage of output diode)\nEfficiency » 70%\nCalculate the primary switch current (I PRI):\nIVI\nV EffVm A\nVA PRIOUT OUT\nIN== =··\n·%.5 500\n57 00 714\nThe “Switch Voltage Drop vs Switch Current” Typical\nPerformance curve gives a typical value of the switch\nvoltage drop (V SW) for a given switch current (I PRI).

I 15% of I PRI\nNext, build a transformer with the calculated values of\nturns ratio and primary inductance. Minimize resistance in\nthe windings. The turns ratio can be tweaked to get thespecified output voltage.\nCapacitors\nThe DC transformer topology runs effectively at 100%\nduty cycle (50% each side). This means that the input\nsupply current is approximately constant. Therefore, large\n“hold-up type” capacitors are not necessary. A low value(>4.7mF), low ESR ceramic will be adequate to filter high\nfrequency noise at the input.\nThe output capacitors supply energy to the output load only\nduring switch transitions. Therefore, large capacitance\nvalues are not necessary. Low ESR, surface mount capaci-\ntors such as ceramic, OS-CON of POSCAPs are recom-mended. An additional LC filter can be added in addition to\nthe output capacitor to further reduce output noise.\nTransformer winding capacitance between the isolated\nprimary and secondary have parasitic currents that can\ncause noise on the grounds. Providing a high frequency,\nlow impedance path between the primary and secondarygives the parasitic currents a local return path. A 2.2nF, 1kV\nceramic capacitor is recommended.\nSwitching Diode Selection\nA fast recovery, surface mount diode such as a Schottky\nis recommended. The proximity of the diodes to the\ntransformer outputs is important and should be as closeas possible with short, wide traces connecting them.Optional LC Filter\nAn optional LC filter, as shown on the Typical Application\non the first page of this data sheet, should be included if\nultralow noise and ripple are required. It is recommendedthat the corner frequency of the filter should be set a\ndecade below the switching frequency so that the switch\nnoise is attenuated by a factor of 100. For example, if thef\nOSC = 100kHz, then f CORNER  = 10kHz where:\n f\nLCCORNER1\n2·p\nOutput Voltage Regulation\nThe output voltage of the DC transformer topology is\nunregulated. Variations in the input voltage will cause theoutput voltage to vary because the output voltage is afunction of the input voltage and the transformer turnratio. Also, variations in the output load will cause theoutput voltage to change because of circuit parasitics,such as the transformer DC resistance and power switchon resistance. If regulation is necessary, a post regulatorsuch as a linear regulator can be added to the output of thesupply. See the Typical Applications for examples ofadding a linear regulator.\nMore Help\nAN70: “A Monolithic Switching Regulator with 100 mV\nOutput Noise” contains much information concerning\napplications and noise measurement techniques.\nAN19: “LT1070 Design Manual”\nAN29: “Some Thoughts on DC-DC Converters” also have\ngeneral knowledge on switching regulators.\nAn LTC SwitcherCAD\nTM model is available to verify design\nperformance.\nThe LTC Applications department is always ready to lend\na helping hand.APPLICATIO  S I  FOR   ATIOWU UU\nSwitcherCAD is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.\n11LT3439\nsn3439 3439fs\nInformation furnished by Linear Technology Corporation is believed to be accurate and reliable.\nHowever, no responsibility is assumed for its use.
