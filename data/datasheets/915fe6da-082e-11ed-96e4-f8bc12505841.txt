Because LVPECL (Positive ECL) levels are usedonly +3.3 V and ground are required. The small outline 8−leadpackage and the single gate of the EPT22 makes it ideal for thoseapplications where space, performance, and low power are at apremium. Because the mature MOSAIC 5 process is used, low costand high speed can be added to the list of features.\nFeatures\n•420 ps Typical Propagation Delay\n•Maximum Frequency = > 1.1 GHz Typical\n•Operating Range: V CC = 3.0 V to 3.6 V with GND = 0 V\n•PNP LVTTL Inputs for Minimal Loading\n•Q Output Will Default HIGH with Inputs Open\n•The 100 Series Contains Temperature Compensation.\n•These Devices are Pb-Free, Halogen Free and are RoHS Compliant\nA = Assembly Location\nL = Wafer Lot\nY = YearW = Work WeekM = Date Code\n/C0071 = Pb-Free PackageSOIC−8 NB\nD SUFFIX\nCASE 751−07\nMARKING DIAGRAMS*TSSOP−8\nDT SUFFIX\nCASE 948R−02\nALYW /C0071\n/C0071KA2218\n18www.onsemi.com\n*For additional marking information, refer to \nApplication Note AND8002/D .18\nKPT22\nALYW\n/C0071\n18DFN8\nMN SUFFIX\nCASE 506AA\n3S M /C0071\n/C0071\n14\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)\nORDERING INFORMATION\nDevice Package Shipping †\nMC100EPT22DG SOIC−8 NB\n(Pb-Free)98 Units/Tube\nMC100EPT22DR2G 2500 Tape & Reel\nTSSOP−8\n(Pb-Free)\nMC100EPT22DTR2G 2500 T ape & ReelMC100EPT22DTG 100 T ape & Reel\nDFN8\n(Pb-Free)MC100EPT22MNR4G 1000 T ape & Reel\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, in -\ncluding part orientation and tape sizes, please refe r\nto our Tape and Reel Packaging Specifications\nBrochure, BRD8011/D .SOIC−8 NB TSSOP−8 DFN8\nSOIC−8 NB\n(Pb-Free)\nTSSOP−8\n(Pb-Free)\nMC100EPT22\nwww.onsemi.com\n21\n2\n3\n45678\nD0\nGNDVCC\nFigure 1. 8−Lead Pinout  (Top View)  and Logic DiagramQ0\nD1 Q1\nQ1Q0\nLVPECL LVTTLTable 1.
