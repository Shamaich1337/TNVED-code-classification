**Description:**
The 90LB-BP-9000-9500 is a WR90 waveguide band pass filter designed to allow signals within a specific frequency range (9.0 to 9.5 GHz) to pass while attenuating signals outside this range. It is constructed from aluminum and features a flange for easy integration into waveguide systems. The filter is characterized by low insertion loss and high rejection levels, making it suitable for high-frequency applications.

**Typical Applications:**
This band pass filter is commonly used in various RF and microwave applications, including:
- **Telecommunications:** To filter specific frequency bands in communication systems.
- **Radar Systems:** For signal processing and filtering in radar equipment.
- **Satellite Communications:** To ensure that only desired frequency signals are transmitted or received.
- **Test Equipment:** In laboratory settings for testing and measurement of RF signals.
- **Aerospace and Defense:** In systems requiring precise frequency filtering for reliable operation.

This component is essential for applications where signal integrity and frequency selectivity are critical, ensuring that only the desired signals are processed while minimizing interference from unwanted frequencies.
