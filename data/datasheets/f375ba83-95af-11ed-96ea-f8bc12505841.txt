The devicesare particularly suitable for implementing bufferregisters, I/O ports, bidirectional bus drivers, andworking registers.\nThe eight flip-flops of the ’AC374 devices are\nD-type edge-triggered flip-flops. On the positivetransition of the clock (CLK) input, the Q outputsare set to the logic levels set up at the data (D)inputs.\nA buffered output-enable (OE\n) input can be used\nto place the eight outputs in either a normal logicstate (high or low logic levels) or thehigh-impedance state. In the high-impedancestate, the outputs neither load nor drive the buslines significantly. The high-impedance state andthe increased drive provide the capability to drivebus lines in bus-organized systems without needfor interface or pullup components.\nOE\n does not af fect internal operations of the flip-flop.

#### Description:
The SN74AC374N is an octal D-type edge-triggered flip-flop with 3-state outputs, designed for high-speed applications. It captures the data on the rising edge of the clock input and provides a high-impedance output state when enabled. This feature allows it to drive bus lines directly, making it suitable for applications that require interfacing with multiple devices on a shared bus.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Buffer Registers:** Used to temporarily hold data before it is sent to another part of the circuit.
- **I/O Ports:** Acts as an interface between the microcontroller and external devices.
- **Bidirectional Bus Drivers:** Facilitates communication between devices on a shared bus.
- **Working Registers:** Stores intermediate data during processing in digital circuits.

The SN74AC374N is particularly useful in digital systems where data needs to be stored and transferred efficiently, making it a versatile component in various electronic applications.
