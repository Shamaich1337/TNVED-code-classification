If 0.254mm (10 mil) thick alumina thin fi  lm substrates must be used, the die should be raised 0.150mm (6 mils) so that the surface of the die is coplanar with the surface of the substrate.  One way to accomplish this is to attach the 0.102mm (4 mil) thick die to a 0.150mm (6 mil) thick molybdenum heat spreader (moly-tab) which is then attached to the ground plane (Figure 2).\nMicrostrip substrates should be brought as close to the die as possible in order to \nminimize bond wire length.  Typical die-to-substrate spacing is 0.076mm (3 mils).\nAn RF bypass capacitor should be used on the Vdd input. A 100 pF single layer \nca p a ci t o r  ( m o u n t e d  e u t u ct i ca l l y  o r  b y  co n d u ct i v e  e p o xy )  p l a c e d  n o  f u rt h e r  t h a n  0.762mm (30 Mils) from the chip is recommended.  The photo in fi  gure 3 shows a typical assembly for the HMC264 MMIC chip.\nHandling Precautions\nFollow these precautions to avoid permanent damage.\nStorage: All bare die are placed in either Waffle or Gel based ESD protective containers, and then sealed in an ESD protective bag \nfor shipment. Once the sealed ESD protective bag has been opened, all die should be stored in a dry nitrogen environment.\nCleanliness: Handle the chips in a clean environment. DO NOT attempt to clean the chip using liquid cleaning systems.\nStatic Sensitivity: Follow ESD precautions to protect against ESD strikes.\nTransients: Suppress instrument and bias supply transients while bias is applied. Use shielded signal and bias cables to minimize \ninductive pick-up.General Handling: Handle the chip along the edges with a vacuum collet or with a sharp pair of bent tweezers. The surface of the chip has fragile air bridges and should not be touched with vacuum collet, tweezers, or fi  ngers.\nMounting\nThe chip is back-metallized and can be die mounted with AuSn eutectic preforms or with electrically conductive epoxy. The mount ing \nsurface should be clean and fl  at.\nEutectic Die Attach: A 80/20 gold tin preform is recommended with a work surface temperature of 255 °C and a tool temperature \nof 265 °C.  When hot 90/10 nitrogen/hydrogen gas is applied, tool tip temperature should be 290 °C. DO NOT expose the chip to a temperature greater than 320 °C for more than 20 seconds.  No more than 3 seconds of scrubbing should be required for attachment.Epoxy Die Attach: Apply a minimum amount of epoxy to the mounting surface so that a thin epoxy fi  llet is observed around the perimeter of the chip once it is placed into position.  Cure epoxy per the manufacturer’s schedule.\nWire Bonding\nBall or wedge bond with 0.025 mm (1 mil) diameter pure gold wire. Thermosonic wirebonding with a nominal stage temperature of 150 °C and a ball bonding force of 40 to 50 grams or wedge bonding force of 18 to 22 grams is recommended.  Use the minimum level of ultrasonic energy to achieve reliable wirebonds. Wirebonds should be started on the chip and terminated on the package  or \nsubstrate.  All bonds should be as short as possible <0.31 mm (12 mils).\nFigure 3: Typical HMC264 Assembly0.102mm (0.004”) Thick GaAs MMIC\nWire Bond\nRF Ground Plane\n0.127mm (0.005”) Thick Alumina\nThin Film Substrate0.076mm\n(0.003”)\nFigure 1.\n0.102mm (0.004”) Thick GaAs MMIC\nWire Bond\nRF Ground Plane\n0.254mm (0.010”) Thick Alumina\nThin Film Substrate0.076mm\n(0.003”)\nFigure 2.0.150mm (0.005”) ThickMoly TabHMC264\nv02.1007\nGaAs MMIC SUB-HARMONICALLY \nPUMPED MIXER, 20 - 32 GHz\nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.

### Component Summary: HMC264

**Description:**
The HMC264 is a GaAs MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) sub-harmonically pumped mixer designed for operation in the frequency range of 20 to 32 GHz. It features an integrated local oscillator (LO) amplifier, allowing it to function as both an upconverter and downconverter. The device is particularly noted for its small size and high isolation between the LO and RF signals, which minimizes the need for additional filtering.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (Vdd): +3 V to +4 V
  - Absolute Maximum Supply Voltage: +5.5 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Supply Current (Idd): 28 mA (typical) to 50 mA (maximum)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Power consumption is primarily determined by the supply current at the specified voltage.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Storage Temperature: -65°C to +150°C
  - Operating Temperature: -55°C to +85°C

- **Package Type:**
  - Chip size: 1.32 mm x 0.97 mm x 0.1 mm

- **Special Features:**
  - Integrated LO amplifier with a nominal drive requirement of -4 dBm.
  - High 2LO/RF isolation: up to 40 dB.
  - Excellent conversion loss and noise figure performance.
  - Designed for 50 Ohm systems.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - Not specified in the provided text, but typically MMICs are sensitive to moisture and should be handled with care.

**Typical Applications:**
The HMC264 is ideal for various high-frequency applications, including:
- Microwave Point-to-Point Radios
- LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Service)
- SATCOM (Satellite Communications)

This component is particularly useful in systems requiring efficient signal mixing at microwave frequencies, where size and performance are critical. Its high isolation and low conversion loss make it suitable for both commercial and military communication systems.
