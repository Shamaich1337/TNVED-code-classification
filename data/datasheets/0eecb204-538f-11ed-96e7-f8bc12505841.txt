  - Absolute Maximum Drain Voltage: +5.5 V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Quiescent Drain Current (I_DQ): 46 mA (typical), adjustable
  - Absolute Maximum Device Current: 100 mA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Typical Power Dissipation: 330 mW

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Storage Temperature: -65°C to +150°C
  - Operating Temperature: -40°C to +85°C
  - Maximum Junction Temperature (T_J): 150°C

- **Package Type:**
  - SOT-343

- **Special Features:**
  - Ultra-low noise figure of 0.8 dB at 900 MHz
  - High linearity with OIP3 of 35 dBm at 1900 MHz
  - Integrated broadband matching networks
  - Single-supply operation (3 V to 5 V)

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level 1 (according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020)

### Typical Applications:
The SPF5043Z is primarily used in:
- Cellular communication systems
- PCS (Personal Communications Service)
- W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access)
- ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) bands
- LTE (Long-Term Evolution) networks
- Low noise, high linearity gain block applications

### Conclusion:
The SPF5043Z is an advanced low-noise amplifier ideal for high-performance RF applications, particularly in communication systems requiring low noise and high linearity. Its flexible supply voltage and integrated matching networks simplify design and implementation, making it a valuable component in modern RF designs.
