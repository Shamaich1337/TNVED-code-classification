DETAILED PIN DESCRIPTION  \nPin Number Name Function\n1 RAMP PWM modulator ramp. In voltage mode an external R −C circuit from V in sets the PWM\nRamp slope to implement feedforward. In current mode control, the resistor of the\nexternal R −C circuit connects to REF for ramp compensation\n2 SS Soft−start control. A 20 μA current source charges the external capacitor connected to\nthis pin. Duty ratio is limited during startup by comparing the voltage on this pin to a\nlevel−shifted VSCLAMP signal. Under steady state conditions, the SS voltage is\napproximately 4.5 V. Once a fault is detected the SS capacitor is discharged and the\ncontroller is disabled\n3 DLMT Maximum duty ratio limit. A resistor between this pin and AGND sets the maximum dutyratio of the controller\n4 DT Dead time control. An external resistor between this pin and AGND sets the overlaptime delay between OUTM and OUTA\n5 RT Oscillator frequency setting pin. The total external resistance connected between theRT and AGND pins sets the internal oscillator frequency\n6 AGND Analog circuit ground reference. All control and timing components that connect toAGND should have the shortest loop possible to this pin to improve noise immunity. It\nshould be tied to PGND at the return of the power stage\n7 COMP Input to the pulse width modulator. An external optocoupler connected between the REF\nand COMP pin sources current into an internal current mirror. The maximum duty ratio\nis achieved when no current is sourced by the optocoupler. The duty cycle reduces tozero once the source current exceeds 850 μA. The internal current mirror improves the\nfrequency response by reducing the ac voltage across the optocoupler transistor\n8 RES Restart time control. A capacitor between this pin and AGND set the shutdown delayand hiccup mode restart delay time. If a restart fault is detected, a pull −up current\nsource, I\nRES(SRC1) , typically 20 μA is enabled. If the RES pin voltage, V RES, exceeds\nthe restart threshold, V RES(TH) , typically 1 V, the controller enters restart mode.\nIRES(SRC1)  is disabled once in restart mode and a second pull up current source,\nIRES(SRC2) , typically 5 μA enabled. I RES(SRC2)  is disabled once V RES reaches\nVRES(peak) , typically 4 V. A pull −down current source, I RES(SNK) , typically 5 μA, is en-\nabled until VRES falls below V RES(valley)  typically 2 V. The controller restarts after 32\nVRES charge/discharge cycles\n9 OVP When this pin is biased beyond 1.25 V, all pulses immediately stop and the controller\nresumes operations after 32 V RES charge/discharge cycles\n10 CS Current sense input. The current sense signal is used for current −mode control,\nadaptive dead time control, cycle −by−cycle current limiting, over −current protection and\nshort circuit protection, etc.\nIf the CS voltage exceeds the cycle by cycle current limit threshold, V ILIM, typically 0.45\nV, the drive pulse is terminated. Internal leading edge blanking prevents triggering of the\ncycle by cycle current limit during normal operation. A short circuit condition exists ifV\nCS exceeds the short −circuit threshold, V ILIM(SC) , typically set to 0.7 V, during two\nconsecutive clock pulses. By inserting a resistor in series with the sense current\ninformation, it is possible to create a voltage offset proportional to the input voltage and\nthus affects the maximum power the converter delivers at high line\n11 REF Precision 5 V reference. Maximum output current is 12 mA. It is required to bypass thereference with a capacitor. The recommended capacitance ranges between 0.1 to 0.47\nμF\n12 OTP Over−temperature protection. A voltage divider containing a NTC connects to this pin\n13 VCC Positive input supply. This pin connects to an external capacitor for energy storage. An\ninternal current source, I start, supplies current from V in to this pin. Once V CC reaches\nVCC(on) , typically 9.5 V, the startup current source is disabled. The current source is\nenabled once V CC falls below V CC(off1) , typically 9.4 V, while faults are present. Once\nfaults are removed and the controller is operating, the startup current source turn −on\nthreshold is reduced to V CC(off2) , typically 7.5 V\n14 OUTM Main switch gate control. OUTM can source 2 A and sink 3 A\n15 PGND Ground connection for OUTM and OUTA. Tie to the power stage return with a short loop\n16 OUTA Active clamp switch gate control. OUTA has an adjustable leading and trailing edge\noverlap delay against OUTM. OUTA can source 2 A and sink 1 A\n17 FLT/SD Fault report and shutdown control. This is a dual −function bi −directional pin. This pin is\nan open−collector output with a 10 k Ω internal pull −up resistance connected to REF\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n6Table 1. DETAILED PIN DESCRIPTION (continued)\nPin Number Function Name\n18 REFA Internally connected to REF\n19 UVLO Input voltage undervoltage detector. The input voltage is scaled down and sampled by\nmeans of a resistor divider. The controller enters standby mode once the UVLO voltage,\nVUVLO , exceeds the standby threshold, V STBY, typically 0.4 V. The controller enters\nshutdown mode if V UVLO  falls below V STBY  by the shutdown hysteresis level. The\ncontroller is enabled once V UVLO  exceeds the enable threshold, V enable , typically 1.25\nV. Hysteresis is provided by an internal pull −down current source, I UVLO , typically 20\nμA. The current source is disabled once the controller is enabled\n20 SYNC This bi−directional pin is used to synchronize the controller or synchronize another \ncontroller driven by this pin\n21 NC No connect (creepage distance)\n22 VIN High voltage startup circuit input. Connect the input line voltage directly to this pin toenable the internal startup regulator. A constant current source supplies current from\nthis pin to the capacitor connected to the VCC pin, eliminating the need for a startupresistor. The minimum charge current is 40 mA. The operating voltage range of the\nstartup circuit is 13 V to 120 V\n23 NC No connect (creepage distance)\n24 VSCLAMP Volt−second clamp. An external R −C divider from the input line generates a voltage\nramp. This ramp is compared to a voltage reference, V SLIMIT , typically 1.5 V. The OUTM\npulse is terminated once the ramp voltage exceeds V SLIMIT , thus limiting the maximum\nvolt−second product of the main transformer. In voltage mode, VSCLAMP and RAMP\npins can be tied together to share one external R −C circuit\nTable 2.

Operating up to 1 MHz, the part canbe configured in either voltage mode control with inputvoltage feedforward or peak −current mode control. An\nadjustable adaptive overlap time between the main powerand the active clamp MOSFETs optimizes system ef ficiency\nbased on load conditions enabling higher efficiency andgreater power density solutions.\nThis controller integrates all the necessary control and\nprotection functions to implement an isolated active −clamp\nforward or asymmetric half −bridge converter with\nsynchronous rectification. It integrates a high −voltage\nstartup bias regulator directly connected to the dc input upto 120 V . The NCP1566 protection features include:\n•A line undervoltage detector to stop operation in case\nthe input rail collapses below a programmable level\n•A two−threshold cycle −by−cycle current limit which\nallows to detect short circuit situations but also\noverload conditions on the dc −dc converter output\n•A line voltage −dependent maximum duty ratio limit to\nsafely operate the forward transformer\n•A programmable over temperature protection using anexternal NTC sensor\n•An over voltage protection (OVP) input in case ofvoltage runaway\n•An over power protection (OPP) scheme which reducesthe available power at high line\n•An adjustable re −start time to force an auto −recovery\nhiccup mode in presence of the above faults\nThe part includes a dedicated pin FL T/SD  for signaling the\npresence of a fault condition. The pin can be used as an input\nto shutdown the controller using an external signal. Thecontroller also features an adjustable restart time.\nHigh−Voltage Startup Circuit\nThe NCP1566 integrates a high voltage startup circuit\naccessible by the V IN pin. The startup circuit is rated up to\na maximum voltage of 120 V . The startup regulator consistsof a constant current source that supplies current from ahigh−voltage rail to the capacitor on the V\nCC pin (CV CC).\nThe startup circuit current (I start) is 40 mA minimum. The\ninternal high voltage startup circuit eliminates the need forexternal startup components. In addition, this regulatorreduces no −load power and increases the system efficiency\nas it uses negligible power in the normal operation mode.\nThe startup circuit is configured to operate in the\nso−called Dynamic Self −Supply (DSS) mode in certain\nconditions. In this DSS mode, V\ncc hiccups between two\nlevels (9.5 and 9.4 V typically) and self supplies the IC inlack of auxiliary supply. This mode can be briefly entered at\nstartup (fault clearance delay) but it is mainly activated in afault state or in lack of auxiliary V\ncc: in this mode, as no\nexternal supply is present, the DSS block permanentlymaintains the controller supply until the auxiliary V\ncc comes\nback. This is the case for instance in deep DCM mode when\nthe part skips cycle. V CC can no longer be maintained\n(pulses are too narrow) and V CC collapses until it hits 7.5 V .\nAt this point, the DSS takes over.\nIt is important to realize that the average current absorbed\nfrom the high −voltage rail V IN in DSS mode is roughly the\naverage current I STARTUP,  AV G self−supplying the chip. As\nsuch, the power dissipated by the chip in DSS mode is V IN\n× ISTARTUP,  AV G   and can be quite high for high input\nvoltages. For this reason, it is not advised to enter in DSSmode when the circuit operates at its maximum currentconsumption. That being said, if the DSS mode istemporarily entered while the controller skips cycles (in ano−load situation), this is fine as long as the junction\ntemperature remains within the data −sheet upper limit.\nPlease make sure power dissipation in this mode always\nrespects the maximum power dissipation capability of the\ncontroller. If the controller is supposed to operate along itsentire input voltage range, DSS mode operation must beprevented.\nA typical startup sequence commences with the charge of\nthe V\ncc capacitor up to the startup threshold V CC(on) , 9.5 V\ntypically. When V CC crosses 7.5 V , the reference pin\ndelivers its 5 V nominal voltage.\nOnce this threshold is reached, the current source turns off\nand the part starts its own internal initialization: it resets allregisters, charges the soft −start capacitor above 0.5 V , makes\nsure all the fault inputs are cleared (FL T/SD\n is high, the Over\nTemperature Protection (OTP) input is low and the inputvoltage sensed by the UVLO input is within acceptablelimits). As the V\nCC capacitor is alone to supply the controller\nduring this startup time, the level across its terminals falls\nand eventually reaches V CC(off1) , typically 9.4 V , especially\nif some faults are still present at startup. At this point, thecurrent source turns back on until V\ncc reaches V CC(on) ,\nagain: a hiccup takes place and lasts until the part is ready to\nswitch, i.e. all faults are cleared. Once internal flags areready, an extra delay is added, \ntdelay(start) , before the part is\nactually enabled and switches. After the enable signal hasbeen asserted, the V\nCC UVLO level drops to V CC(off2) ,\ntypically 7.5 V\nDuring the initialization sequence, the main power\nMOSFET is not switching, OUTM is low. On the opposite,\nto allow the immediate availability of the low −side\nP−channel active clamp switch, its dedicated output OUTA\nis raised to V CC when the 9.5V threshold is reached. This is\nto allow the pre −charge of the P −channel charge pump\ncapacitor and makes it ready for operation.\nWhile the part is enabled, the voltage on the soft −start (SS)\ncapacitor is slowly rising up and when it crosses the internal\n1.35 V of fset, OUTM starts to produce low duty ratio pulses,\ndriving the forward converter main power MOSFET. Please\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n19note that while the internal enable flag is not asserted (during\nthe initialization sequence or during a fault), the voltage onthe SS pin is clamped to 0.85 V , naturally putting the part in\nready−to−pulse mode whenever enable gets asserted.\nAt the end of the initialization sequence, the controller\nstops the high −voltage startup source and V\ncc drops as the\nauxiliary voltage did not build up yet. Before reaching thelower regulation threshold, V\nCC(off2) , typically 7.5 V , the\nauxiliary winding must have appeared to take over thecontroller supply. You will size the V\nCC capacitor in that\nway. If for any reason the auxiliary winding did not build up\nbefore V CC reaches 7.5 V , the current source turns back on\nagain to maintain the controller supply in a kind ofnon−regulated hysteretic mode. In this DSS mode, the\ncurrent capability is 40 mA at minimum and you have tomake sure the internal IC consumption (including drivingcurrent) is well below 40 mA. During this mode, the average\ncurrent absorbed by the V\nIN pin is roughly the average\ncurrent consumed by the part. Care must be taken to ensure\nthat a low current is absorbed while in the upper input\nvoltage range. Failure to respect this fact will damage thecontroller by thermal runaway.\nIn case an accidental overload of the DSS would occur\n(you consume too much on the V\ncc pin and the DSS cannot\nmaintain V CC), the voltage would drop to V CC(MIN) ,\ntypically 6.5 V . In this mode, the reference voltage is turned\noff and the part restarts after a start −up sequence. When V cc\ncrosses 7.5 V again, the reference voltage is turned back on.\nA typical successful start −up sequence appears in Figure 4\nwhile it fails in Figure 5 as the current absorbed from the V cc\nis too high. In this case, the part restarts again for another\nattempt.\nFigure 4.

However, if the capacitance\nhas adversely dropped because of extreme temperatures\nconditions for instance, it can happen that V CC drops too fastand the DSS is activated. This is what Figure 6 shows. DSS\ntakes over until V CC aux builds up. Again, care must be\ntaken to ensure that part power dissipation remains within\nacceptable limits.\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n21The operating IC bias current, I CC4, and gate charge load\nat the drive outputs must be considered to correctly sizeCV\nCC. To size this capacitor, you must account for the\nMOSFET drive current. The average current absorbed from\nthe V CC capacitor at startup depends on the switching\nfrequency FSW and the total gate charge QG as follows:\nIDRV/C0043FSWQG (eq. 1)\nAssume we picked a 40 nC gate −charge MOSFET\noperated at 200 kHz. The average current absorbed by thedriver will be:\nIDRV/C0043200k/C003240n/C00438m A (eq. 2)\nThe capacitor value depends on several parameters:\n•The allowed voltage drop before the controller activates\nthe DSS at 7.5 V . This drop is 2 V , from 9.5 to 7.5 V\n•The current sourced by the capacitor while the auxiliarywinding is building up. It is made of (1) plus theinternal controller consumption, I\nCC4 (4 mA at 200\nkHz)\n•The time taken by the auxiliary winding to build up is\nmore difficult to assess given the numerous parameters\nat play: primary −side current limit, soft −start duration,\noutput capacitance and so on.

During thepower off sequence, the OUTA pin will remain high and\nfollow the V CC as it slowly discharges. This is to avoid\nobserving a glitch in the output voltage if OUTA would go\nlow at the V CC under−voltage lockout point. Figure 8 shows\nhow the output evolves with time when shutting off thecontroller.\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n22Figure 8. When OUTA Gently Follows V CC at Turn Off, the P −channel MOSFET \nno Longer Conducts at the V CC UVLO and the Output Voltage is Glitch −free\nLine Undervoltage Detector\nThe NCP1566 monitors the line voltage and enables the\ncontroller when the input voltage is within the requiredrange. The input voltage is sampled using a resistor divider\nand applied to the UVLO pin. A small bypass capacitor isrecommended for noise filtering. The UVLO input can be\nused as an enable/disable function. Figure 9 shows the\nUVLO detector architecture.\nBy monitoring the voltage on the UVLO pin, the\ncontroller can be put in three different modes: disable,standby and enable. The controller enters standby modeonce the UVLO voltage, V\nUVLO , exceeds the standby\nthreshold, V STBY , typically 0.4 V . The standby mode\nfeatures a 100 mV hysteresis, V STBY(HYS) , which, added to\na 1.5 μs delay, provides adequate noise immunity. In standby\nmode, V CC hiccups between 9.5 and 9.4 V , the reference\nvoltage is maintained. The FLT/SD  pin is pulled low to\nsignal the UVLO. Figure 10 illustrates an input voltage dropthat keeps V UVLO  above 0.4 V , putting the part into standby\nmode.\nThe controller transitions into the enable mode once\nVUVLO  exceeds V enable , typically 1.25 V . Once in enable\nmode, the controller is allowed to start if no other faults are\npresent. An internal pull −down current source, I STBY ,\nprovides hysteresis. It is typically 20 μA. I STBY  turns off\nonce the controller is enabled, allowing V UVLO  to rise above\nVenable  by the hysteresis level set by R1. The controller is\ndisabled if V UVLO  falls below V ENABLE , at which point\nISTBY  is re−enabled creating a voltage drop on the UVLO\npin. A maximum delay of 1 μs, tENABLE(delay) , on the Enable\nComparator provides noise immunity. I STBY  is disabled\nwhile V CC is below V CC(off2)  during power up or if V CC falls\nbelow V CC(reset)  after I STBY  has been enabled. Figure 11\nshows how the part enters the disable mode as the inputvoltage collapses. It restarts 1 second later when the inputvoltage comes back again.\nFigure 9.

In a forward converteraffected by magnetizing current and propagation delay, the\nmaximum output current the converter can deliver at the\nmaximum input voltage depends on the line input level:power is maximum at high line. To prevent output currentrunaway, the NCP1566 includes the possibility to generatea voltage offset on the CS pin proportional to the level sensedby the UVLO pin. By injecting a current out of the CS pin,the designer can insert a resistance in series with the sensedvoltage and calibrate the offset to his exact needs at the\nhighest input level. At the lowest input voltage, e.g. 36 V(V\nUVLO  = 1.4 V), the current generator delivers 0 A and\nlinearly increases to a maximum of 100 μA when V UVLO\nreaches 2.8 V .\nSoft−start\nSoft−start slowly increases the duty ratio during power up,\nallowing the controller to gradually reach steady −state\noperation by slowly increasing the output voltage whilereducing startup circuit stress. The duty ratio is controlled by\ncomparing the SS pin voltage, V\nSS, to the VSCLAMP pin\nvoltage, V SCLAMP . VSCLAMP  is level−shifted by 1.35 V\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n24before comparing it to V SS. This ensures a minimum duty\nratio of 0%.\nVSS is slowly increased by charging the soft −start\ncapacitor with a fixed current source, I SS, typically 20 μA.\nOUTM is disabled once the peak voltage of V SCLAMP\nexceeds V SS. The soft−start pin is internally grounded while\na fault is present.\nCurrent Sense\nA signal proportional to the current across the main switch\nis applied to the CS pin. The current sense information isused to calculate the average primary current to modulate\nthe drivers overlap time and implement overcurrentprotection (OCP). It is also used for cycle by cycle peak\ncurrent limit control and detecting a short circuit condition.\nFigure 12 shows the block diagram of the current limitcircuitry.\nFigure 12. The Current Limit Circuitry Implements Three Distinct Comparators .\nStart the fault timer\nVdd UVLO\nOPP circuitry\nThe controller can identify three different types of\novercurrent conditions:\n•Regular current pulse: in a forward converter normal\noperation, the primary current is made of the reflected\ninductor current to which adds the primary magnetizing\ncurrent. When the voltage image of this current exceeds\nthe feedback setpoint (in current mode) or themaximum sense voltage (0.45 V typical in voltage\nmode), the current pulse is terminated. When this\ncomparator trips, a 150 ms fault timer starts counting\nand shuts the controller down upon completion if the\noverload remains present•Short−circuit pulse: if an abnormally −high current pulse\nis detected (0.7 V) for two consecutive clockpulses, the\npart shuts off and goes into restart mode. This can\nhappen during a winding short circuit or in presence ofa defective component in the secondary side\n•Overcurrent condition: in case the converter’s output is\noverloaded, the average input current will increase,\nreflecting the average input power increase. The\nNCP1566 averages the primary −side current sense\ninformation and when it exceeds a certain value, a\nshutdown delay starts. When this delay elapses, the part\nshuts off and goes into restart mode\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n25Figure 13.

The LEB prevents unwanted\nnoise from terminating the drive pulses prematurely. It is\nrecommended to place a small RC filter close to the CS pin\nto suppress noise. The LEB period begins once V\nOUTM\nreaches approximately 2 V . To improve the pin noiseimmunity, an internal switch, R\nCS(switch) , discharges and\nholds the CS pin low at the conclusion of every cycle. Theswitch is enabled while the main driver is low. Themaximum resistance of the switch, is 20 Ω..\nThe average information is reconstructed from the CS\ninformation and used to determine the OCP shutdown delay.\nOnce the average current information, C\nS(A VG) , exceeds\nVILIM(A VE) , typically 0.3 V , the 5 μA pull−down current\nsource, I RES(SNK) , is disabled and the 20 μA pull−up current\nsource, I RES(SRC1) , is enabled to charge the RES capacitor.\nThe average current information is blanked by thet\nILIMA VE(LEB)  timer, typically 30 ns. As long as an\novercurrent is sensed, the capacitor connected to the RES\npin continues its charge. If the overcurrent disappears, the 20μA source stops and the capacitor discharges with the 5 μA\npull−down source. If the overcurrent comes back again, the\n20 μA source takes over and lifts the capacitor voltage\ntowards the 1−V threshold. When it is reached, the part stops\nall operations and goes into restart mode: 32 up/downvoltage cycles between 2/4 V are counted on the RES pin\nbefore an attempt to restart occurs.\nCycle by cycle peak current limit protection is\nimplemented using the cycle −by−cycle comparator. It\nterminates the drive pulse if the CS voltage exceeds V\nILIM,\ntypically 0.45 V . The cycle −by−cycle current information isblanked by the t ILIM(LEB)  timer, typically 55 ns. The\ncycle−by−cycle comparator propagation delay, t ILIM(delay) ,\nis typically 40 ns. Cycle −by−cycle peak current limit\nprotection is available in all operating modes. When the 0.45\nV comparator toggles high, an internal error flag is assertedand a 150 ms timer starts elapsing. As long as the 0.45 Vcomparator terminates a switching cycle, the counter keeps\nadvancing. When the 0.45 V no longer trips (meaning theoverload is momentarily gone), the counters countsbackwards until a) it definitively resets or b) a new overload\ncomes back and brings it back up counting until it\ncompletely elapses. When the counter has reached 150 ms,\nall pulses are immediately stopped and an auto −restart\nsequence is initiated. Figure 13 describes a typical faultsequence.\nThe short circuit comparator protects the controller during\na winding short circuit condition for instance. Thecomparator terminates the drive pulse if the CS voltageexceeds V\nILIM(SC) , typically 0.7 V . The short circuit current\ninformation is blanked by the t ILIMSC(LEB)  timer, typically\n30 ns. The short circuit comparator propagation delay,t\nILIMSC(delay) , is typically 40 ns. Two consecutive short\ncircuit conditions cause the controller to enter restart modewithout a shutdown delay or shutdown pulse.\nFigure 14 shows simulation waveforms during a short\ncircuit fault. Once the overcurrent fault is detected the main\ndriver operates at minimum on time. At the third internal\nclock cycle, the short circuit condition is confirmed and a\nrestart sequence is initiated. In restart mode, V\nCC is\nhiccupping between V CC(on)  and V CC(off1)  and the soft −start\ncapacitor is discharged.\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n26Figure 14.

In both instances,\ngood PCB layout practices are required to ensure correct\noperation of the current sense detection circuitry. A few are\nlisted below:\n1. The current sense filter capacitor must be placed\nas close as possible to the IC and referenced to theAGND pin\n2. When using a current sense transformer both leads\nof the transformer secondary should be routed tothe filter network located very close to the IC\n3. Low current signals should all be connected to the\nAGND net. AGND should connect to the powerground at the return terminal of the input capacitor\n4. If using a current sense resistor, the return path\nshould be connected to PGND and not AGNDOver Power Protection\nThe maximum continuous output current delivered by a\nCCM−operated forward converter depends on the\nmaximum peak current authorized in the primary side.However, some parameters such as input voltage,propagation delay and magnetizing current can have an\nimpact on the maximum available current. In some designs,\nthe maximum current limit at high line (72 V) can be largerthan that at low line (36 V) and problems can arise from this\ndiscrepancy. To prevent or limit this overpowerphenomenon, a current source is connected to the CS pin and\nsources current out of the pin. This is what is shown in Figure\n15.\nFigure 15. A Current Source Proportional to the Voltage on the UVLO Pin Creates a Variable Voltage \nOffset on the Current −sense PinCSPWM\nRSTVDD\nIOPP VUVLO\nIOPP ROPP\nRSENSE\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n27Figure 16.

Using the left −side\nresistor values, for a 37 V input voltage, the offset current is\n0 A and there is no overpower: the converter delivers its full\npower. As the UVLO voltage increases, the offset currentalso grows and builds an offset on the CS pin. This offset is\nmaximal for a 74 V input for the selected resistors.\nThe maximum output current an active −clamp forward\nconverter can deliver is difficult to analytically predict asseveral parameters play a role there. If experimentally youdetermine that adding a 48 mV offset on the CS pin trips the\nprotection at a 72 V input, then insert a resistor whose value\nis 48 m / 100 μ = 480 Ω. In case you do not want any offset,just drive the CS pin with a low resistance and the offset\ndisappears.\nOver Voltage Protection\nThe circuit includes an auto −recovery over −voltage\nprotection pin. You have to bias the pin above 1.25 Vtypically to immediately stop switching pulses and force an\nauto−restart mode. At that moment, a 20 μA current source\nactivates and lifts the pin to provide hysteresis. At the end of\nthe auto−restart mode, the controller monitors the OVP pin\nand if its voltage has gone back below 1.25 V , the IC resumesoperations. Figure 17 shows the internal configuration.\nFigure 17.

A clamp helpspreventing magnetizing current runaway and transformersaturation in faulty situations. An external RC divider(R\nVSCLAMP −CVSCLAMP ) from the input line generates the\nVSCLAMP ramp to control the volt −second limit of the\nconverter. The slope of the ramp is proportional to the input\nvoltage and controls the maximum on −time during a line\nvoltage transition. The ramp prevents from exceeding themaximum volt −second of the transformer by clamping the\nduty ratio excursion during the transient input. As NCP1566\ncan be configured to operate in both voltage mode and peakcurrent mode control, Figure 18 and Figure 19 respectively\nshow the recommended clamp configuration for theseoperating modes.\nFigure 18. The VSCLAMP Configuration in Voltage −mode Control\nFigure 19. The VSCLAMP Configuration in Peak Current −mode Control\nThe PWM drive pulse terminates once the VSCLAMP\nramp reaches V SLIMIT , typically 1.5 V . The RC divider is\nselected such that the VSCLAMP ramp peak voltage\nreaches V SLIMIT  at the desired maximum volt −second limit.\nThe VSCLAMP pin is pulled down by SW VSCLAMP  at the\nend of every cycle and is held low until the next drive pulse.The volt−second limit depends on the transformer you\nhave. Assume the transformer specification allows amaximum volt−second product of 111.6 V −μs for a 200 kHz\noperation (62% duty ratio max at a 36 V input voltage). It\nmeans that maximum on −times at low and high line cannot\nrespectively exceed:\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n29ton,maxLL/C0116V/C0042/C0109smax\nvin,min/C0043111.6\n36/C00433.1/C0109s (eq. 10)\nton,maxHL/C0116V/C0042/C0109smax\nvin,max/C0043111.6\n76/C00431.47/C0109s (eq. 11)\nThe RC network is thus dimensioned so that the ramp hits\nthe 1.5 V limit in less than 1.47 μs when the input voltage is\n76 V or 3.1 μs when the input is 36 V . Let us select anormalized capacitor value of 1 nF for instance.

A signal proportional to the loop error\nsignal is applied to this pin using an optocoupler. A voltage\nproportional to the error signal, V ERROR , is internallygenerated and compared to a regulation ramp. The on −time\nterminates once the ramp exceeds the internal error voltage.\nIn voltage −mode control the VSCLAMP ramp signal is used\nfor regulation (see Figure 18). In current mode control the\nsum of the current sense ramp and the voltage compensationramp is used for regulation.\nThe internal error voltage is generated by applying a\ncurrent into the COMP pin as shown in Figure 20. TheCOMP current is internally mirrored with a 10 −to−1 ratio.\nThe mirrored current pulls down on a 50 −k pull−up resistor\nfrom V\nREF.\nFigure 20. COMP Input Architecture50 k 4001.35 V\nVrefPWM comp\nOUTM\nCompRamp\nAn almost constant voltage across the optocoupler is\nachieved when using a current −based feedback input. This\nresults in a faster system response because duty ratio adjusts\nwithout the need to charge/discharge the large optocoupler\nparasitic capacitance. In the frequency domain, theoptocoupler pole is moved to a higher frequency allowingthe system to operate at a higher crossover frequency. TheCOMP pin dynamic resistance is 400 Ω. This resistance does\nnot play a role in the loop gain but enters the picture if youplan to place a capacitor across the COMP pin to ground.\nMaximum duty ratio is achieved when the COMP current\nis 0 A or when the pin is left open. A duty ratio of 0% is\nachieved when the COMP current is approximately 850 μA.Frequency\nThe oscillator frequency, FSW, is set by placing a resistor,\nRT, between the RT and AGND pins.

The\nadjustable duty ratio range is between 50 and 80%. Themaximum duty ratio accuracy is ±3%. The resistor that sets\nthe maximum duty ratio depends on the timing resistance\ncalculated in (14). It depends on the timing resistance but\nalso on an overlap delay, t\nD1. The overlap time (t D1) between\nOUTA and OUTM reduces the effective duty ratio ofOUTM. Please look in the electrical characteristics table toknow what overlap value to use.\nRDLMT/C00439/C0032DCmax/C0041828n/C0032Fsw\nFsw/C0032486p(eq. 16)\nAssume our transformer specification states a maximum\nduty ratio of 63%.

When operatingin standalone, the SYNC pin delivers narrow pulses of 150ns width and a 3 V minimum amplitude. When driving\nanother controller, the master frequency must be higher than\nthe slave frequency, typically by a maximum of 20%. Thecloser frequencies are the faster synchronization occurs.When connected to another controller, the master delivers a\nfirst 600 μA pull−up pulse (0 to 1 transition) followed 150\nns later by a second 150 ns 1.2 mA pull −down pulse. The rest\nof the time, the pin maintains 0 V through a 30 μA\npull−down. Please note that the synchronization operation\nrespects the maximum duty ratio and volt −second set by the\nslave controller. In applications where synchronization isnot needed, the SYNC pin can be safely grounded to theclosest controller quiet ground.\nFigure 21.

This locking sequence will last longer if\nfrequencies between master and slave are away from each\nother.\nFault Reporting and Shutdown Input\nThe FLT/SD  pin reports the presence of a fault to an\nexternal supervisory circuitry. It also can be used to\nshutdown the controller if externally brought down. This pin\nhas an open collector output with a 10 k Ω internal pull −up\nresistor (R FLT/SD ) connected to the 5 V reference. The\nFLT/SD  pin is internally pulled low (to indicate a fault) by\nan internal transistor, , when an overcurrent, short circuit,V\nCC(UVLO) , OVP, OTP or low input voltage fault is\ndetected. The pin is also pulled low when the controller is in\nrestart mode.During the initialization sequence, the shutdown\ndetection pin is released once V REF reaches its regulation\nlevel. The controller considered that the FLT/SD  pin is\ncleared from a fault when the pin voltage, V FLT/SD , exceeds\nthe enable threshold, V FLT(enable) , typically 1.45 V ,  and V SS\nexceeds V SS(disable) , typically 0.5 V . The controller is\ndisabled once V FLT/SD , falls below the shutdown threshold,\nVfault, typically 1.25 V . While the controller is in shutdown\nstate, V CC is hiccupping between 9.5/9.4 V typically and\nVREF is kept high. When the FL T/SD  pin is brought low, the\npart activates the restart delay (RES is cycled up and down\n32 times) before a new restart is authorized when the\nFLT/SD  pin is released.\nFigure 22 gathers all the possible events that can activate\nthe fault pin.\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n31Figure 22.

In short circuitoperations, this technique limits the overall dissipatedpower. Once the fault is gone, the controller automatically\nresumes operations. A restart event occurs if one of the\nfollowing faults is detected:\n•Overcurrent fault (OCP)•Overvoltage fault (OVP)\n•Two consecutive short −circuit pulses (SCP)\n•Overtemperature fault detected on OTP pin\n•Internal thermal shutdown fault\n•The FLT/SD  pin has been externally pulled low\nPlease note that the  pin is internally held low during the\nduration of the restart timer. The simplified architecture ofthe restart timer is shown in Figure 23.\nFigure 23. Restart Timer Architecture\n\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n32A pull−down current source, I RES(SNK) , typically 5 μA,\nholds the RES pin at a low level when no faults are present.\nThe restart timer sequentially charges and discharges 32\ntimes the capacitor on the RES pin, C RES, between 2 V and\n4 V to set the restart or hiccup duration. A fault triggers arestart or hiccup delay with the exception of an overcurrent\nfault. An overcurrent fault starts the shutdown delay timerbefore drive pulses are cut. A restart sequence initiates once\nthe shutdown delay expires.\nThe RES pin combines two functions: the restart delay\nand the shutdown delay. As explained, the restart delay is\nmade of 32 up/down cycles between 2/4 V on the RES pin.\nThe shutdown delay is actually the time taken by the RESpin to charge from 0 to 1 V . This charge is initiated by the\naverage input current reconstruction. When this internalaveraged current exceeds 0.3 V , the capacitor on the RES pin\nis charged by the 20 μA source. If the over current goes\naway, the capacitor slowly dischar ges via a 5 μA pull−down\ncurrent sink. If the fault comes back, the 5 μA sink turns off\nand the 20 μA is reactivated. When the capacitor voltage\neventually reaches 1 V , all pulses are stopped, a shutdownpulse is issued and the part enters auto −recovery hiccup\nmode via the restart delay.\nFigure 24 shows operating waveforms during an overload\ncondition. A SHDN pulse is generated and the controller is\ndisabled once V\nRES exceeds 1 V .\nFigure 24.

Charge and discharge currents are equal to 5 μA and\nrespectively correspond to parameters I RES(SRC2)  and\nIRES(SNK) . The restart mode ends after 32 consecutive\ncharge/discharge cycles. C RES is then pulled low using an\ninternal pull down transistor, SW RES. The transistor isdisabled once V RES falls below the discharge level,\nVRES(DIS) , typically 100 mV . Once C RES is fully discharged\na new startup sequence commences and soft −start is\nreleased.\nDuring the restart delay, the VCC pin is maintained by the\ncontroller operating the high −voltage current source in the\nDSS mode: the voltage hiccups between 9.4 and 9.5 V .\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n33Figure 25.

The main output, OUTM, can\nsink a minimum of 3 A and source a minimum of 2 A. The\nsecondary output, OUTA, can sink a minimum of 1 A andsource a minimum of 2 A.\nOUTM is configured to drive an N −channel MOSFET as\nthe main switch. OUTA is configured to drive a P −channel\nMOSFET which source is grounded. OUTA is purposelysized smaller than OUTM because the active clampMOSFET only sees the magnetizing current in an active\nclamp forward topology. Therefore, a smaller active clamp\nMOSFET with less input capacitance is used compared tothe main switch. Also, on −losses associated with this\nP−channel have a beneficial damping effect on the\nL\nmagCclamp  resonating network.\nOnce V CC reaches V CC(on) , the internal startup circuit is\ndisabled and OUTA goes high to pre −charge the P −channel\ncharge pump capacitor. OUTA goes low following OUTM\nafter the overlap delay expires. OUTA remains high while\nthe controller is disabled or until V CC falls below V CC(reset) .\nThe outputs are biased directly from V CC and their high\nstate voltage is approximately V CC. Therefore, the auxiliary\nsupply voltage should not exceed the maximum gate voltage\nof the main and active clamp MOSFETs.\nThe inductance between the drivers and its load should be\nkept to a minimum to minimize current -induced voltagespikes. This can be achieved by reducing the connection\nlength between the drivers and their loads and using widetraces for connections.\nOverlap Time\nIn an active clamp forward converter, there are two delays\ninvolved in the driving signals. Both deal with Zero V oltage\nSwitching (ZVS) operations. When the main N −channel\nMOSFET turns off, the magnetizing current finds an\nimmediate path in the P −channel body diode. The\nconduction of this diode forces a low voltage across thedrain−source terminals of the considered MOSFET. Once\nthis condition is obtained, the P −channel can be turned on.\nThis delay ensures ZVS is present for the P −channel. To\nlimit switching losses on the main N −channel MOSFET, you\nalso want to ensure quasi or full ZVS operation. To meet this\nrequirement, the P−channel will be turned off slightly before\nturning on the N −channel so that the drain −source voltage\ncan swing down to ground or approach it: this is the seconddelay.\nA simplified block diagram and waveforms of an active\nclamp forward converter with a low side active clamp switch\nare shown in Figure 26. Driver OUTM drives the mainswitch where as OUTAC drives the active clamp switch.Overlap time between the drive signals is required to achieve\nzero or near zero volts switching (ZVS) on the switches.\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n34Figure 26. Active −clamp Forward Topology\nOUTA leads OUTM during a low to high transition by a\ntime duration given by t D. OUTA trails OUTM during a high\nto low transition by the same time duration. Figure 27 showsthe overlap time delays between the OUTA and OUTM\ndrive signals.\nFigure 27. Overlap Time WaveformsN−channel\nP−channelt\nt\nVOUTA  (t)VOUTM  (t)VDS (t)\ntD1\ntD2\nt\nThe overlap time is usually optimized for full −load\nefficiency. However, the optimum overlap time required toachieve ZVS varies with line and load conditions. In light\nload, the magnetizing energy is reduced slowing down the\ndrain voltage transitions. Keeping the same overlapregardless of loading conditions can affect the converter’sefficiency along its operating range. NCP1566 adaptivelyadjusts the overlap times to optimize the system efficiencyacross operating conditions. The current sense information\n(representative of load) is used to adjust the overlap times.The overlap times are essentially constant at mid to high\nload. In light load conditions, overlap times are inversely\nproportional to load current. The adaptive overlap timeadjustment becomes active around 30 % of the maximumload.\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n35A resistor, R DT, between the DT and AGND pins adjusts\nthe overlap time. The minimum trailing delay is 20 ns.Equations 18 shows the relationship between overlap delays\nand R\nDT, the scaled −down input voltage and the current\nsense voltage.\ntD(VCS)/C0043RDR/C00321.66/C003210/C004216\n1.4 V\n37 k/C0041minimum/C0466VCS\n2k,1.4 V\n35 k/C0467(eq. 18)For our 200 kHz dc −dc converter, the dead −time\nresistance R DT is calculated using the maximum value at a\n0.4 V CS bias.

It\nprovides current up to 12 mA. This reference can be used for\nbiasing an external circuitry. A bypass capacitor is required\nfor stability. The recommended minimum capacitance is 0.1μF. The reference is enabled once V\nUVLO  exceeds V STBY\nand V CC exceeds 7.5 V . It is disabled once V CC falls below\nVCC(reset) , typically 6.4 V . The reference pin incorporates an\nundervoltage detector. The reference is disabled if it fallsbelow its undervoltage lockout threshold, V\nREF(UVLO) ,\ntypically 4.5 V . The reference undervoltage lockout hashysteresis, V\nREF(HYS) , typically 200 mV . The controller is\nimmediately disabled if a V REF undervoltage lockout fault\nis detected. A 1.5 μs filter delay provides noise immunity.\nVREF is biased directly from V CC. Therefore, if a load is\napplied to V CC while V REF is charging, chances exist toprevent the auxiliary voltage from properly building up,\naborting the startup sequence. V CC and V REF capacitors\nshould be sized such that the charging of V REF does not\ncause V CC to fall below V CC(reset) . Otherwise, the reference\nwill be disabled and an unexpected hiccup can be observed.\nIf too much current is drawn from the REF pin, V CC will\ncollapse. Once V CC falls V CC(min)  a shutdown pulse on\nOUTM and forcing OUTA high. Once OUTM goes low, the\ncontroller is disabled resulting in a discharge of the soft −start\ncapacitor. V REF and OUTA are disabled once V CC falls\nbelow V CC(reset) . Once V REF is disabled, the overload\ncondition is removed allowing V CC to charge back up.\nWhen the part is operated up to 120 V , it is important to\nlimit the current absorbed from the REF pin during thestart−up sequence or the hiccup mode.\nNCP1566\nwww. onsemi.com\n36Power Dissipation\nThe controller junction −to−ambient thermal resistance\nR/C0113JA depends on the available copper surface it is soldered\nupon.

The controller is disabled\nwithout a shutdown pulse if the junction temperature\nexceeds the thermal shutdown threshold, T SHDN , typically\n165/C0095C. The controller restarts once the IC temperature\ndrops below below T SHDN  by the thermal shutdown\nhysteresis, T SHDN(HYS) , typically 20 /C0095C and V CC has\ncharged to V CC(on)  at least once while in thermal shutdown\nmode.\nA thermal shutdown fault is cleared if V CC drops below\nVCC(reset) , or if V UVLO  falls below V STBY  by its hysteresis\nlevel. A power−up sequence commences at the next V CC(on)\nif all faults are removed.\nOrdering Information\nTable 6.
