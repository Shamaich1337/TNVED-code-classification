Optimized for ultrasound systems, they are usable as a \nlow noise variable gain element at frequencies up to 120 MHz. \nIncluded in each channel are an ultralow noise preamp (LNA), \nan X-AMP® VGA with 48 dB of gain range, and a selectable gain postamp with adjustable output limiting. The LNA gain is 19 dB \nwith a single-ended input and differential outputs. Using a single \nresistor, the LNA input impedance can be adjusted to match a \nsignal source without compromising noise performance. \nThe 48 dB gain range of the VGA makes these devices suitable \nfor a variety of applications. Excellent bandwidth uniformity is maintained across the entire range. The gain control interface provides precise linear-in-dB scaling of 50 dB/V for control \nvoltages between 40 mV and 1 V . Factory trim ensures excellent \npart-to-part and channel-to-channel gain matching.

The gain of the postamp can be pin selected to 3.5 dB or 15.5 dB to optimize gain range and output noise for 12-bit or 10-bit converter applications. The \noutput can be limited to a user-selected clamping level, preventing \ninput overload to a subsequent ADC. An external resistor adjusts \nthe clamping level. \nThe operating temperature range is −40°C to +85°C. The \nAD8331 is available in a 20-lead QSOP package, the AD8332 is available in 28-lead TSSOP and 32-lead LFCSP packages, and \nthe AD8334 is available in a 64-lead LFCSP package. \nAD8331/AD8332/AD8334 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

The input -referred noise level is determined by dividing the output noise by the numerical ga in between Point A  \nand Point B  and accounting for the noise floor of the spectrum \nanalyzer. The gain should be measured at each frequency of \ninterest and with low si gnal levels because a 50 Ω load is driven \ndirectly. The generator is removed when noise mea surements \nare made.  \n \n03199-055LMD18nF\n22pFFB*\n120nH\n*FERRITE BEADIN OUT\n0.1µFDUTNETWORK ANALYZER\n0.1µF\n28Ω237Ω28Ω\n1:150Ω 50Ω\n270Ω\nINH237Ω0.1µF\n0.1µF\n \nFigure 55.

The gain range is +48 dB, extending from −4.5 dB to +43.5 dB in LO gain and +7.5 dB to +55.5 dB in HI gain mode. The slope of the gain control interface is 50 dB/V , \nand the gain control range is 40 mV to 1 V . Equation 1 and \nEquation 2 are the expressions for gain. \nGAIN  (dB) = 50 (dB/V) × V\nGAIN − 6.5 dB, (HILO  = LO) (1) \nor GAIN  (dB) = 50 (dB/V) × V\nGAIN + 5.5 dB, (HILO  = HI) (2) \nThe ideal gain characteristics are shown in Figure 73. \n60\n5040302010\n0\n–10\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.1GAIN (dB)\nVGAIN (V)\n03199-073HILO = HI\nHILO = LO\nASCENDING GAIN MODE\nDESCENDING GAIN MODE\n(WHERE AVAILABLE)\n \nFigure 73. Ideal Gain Control Characteristics \nThe gain slope is negative with MODE pulled high (where \navailable), as follows: \nGAIN  (dB) = −50 (dB/V) × VGAIN + 45.5 dB, ( HILO  = LO) (3) \nor GAIN  (dB) = −50 (dB/V) × V\nGAIN + 57.5 dB, ( HILO  = HI) (4) \nThe LNA converts a single-ended input to a differential output \nwith a voltage gain of 19 dB. If only one output is used, the gain \nis 13 dB. The inverting output is used for active input impedance \ntermination. Each of the LNA outputs is capacitively coupled to a VGA input. The VGA consists of an attenuator with a range of 48 dB followed by an amplifier with 21 dB of gain for a net gain range of −27 dB to +21 dB. The X-AMP , gain interpolation technique results in low gain error and uniform bandwidth, and differential signal paths minimize distortion. \nThe final stage is a logic programmable amplifier with gains of \n3.5 dB or 15.5 dB. The LO and HI gain modes are optimized for 12-bit and 10-bit ADC applications, in terms of output-referred noise and absolute gain range. Output voltage limiting can be \nprogrammed by the user. \n    LOW NOISE AMPLIFIER (LNA) \nGood noise performance in the AD8331/ AD8332/ AD8334 \nrelies on a proprietary ultralow noise preamplifier at the beginning \nof the signal chain, which minimizes the noise contribution in the following VGA. Active impedance control optimizes noise per-formance for applications that benefit from input matching. \nA simplified schematic of the LNA is shown in Figure 74. INH \nis capacitively coupled to the source. A bias generator establishes dc \ninput bias voltages of 3.25 V and centers the output common-mode levels at 2.5 V . A capacitor C\nLMD (can be the same value as \nthe input coupling capacitor C INH) is connected from the LMD \npin to ground to decouple the LMD bus. The LMD pin is not \nuseable for configuring the LNA as a differential input amplifier. \n03199-074RSCINH\nCSHI0\nI0 I0I0\nQ1 Q2VPOS\nVCM\nBIASLOP\nINH 3.25V 3.25V–a –aLONTO\nVGA\n2.5V 2.5V\nCLMDLMDCIZ RIZ\n60Ω 40Ω 80Ω\n \nFigure 74. Simplified LNA Schematic \nThe LNA supports differential output voltages as high as 5 V p-p, \nwith positive and negative excursions of ±1.25 V , about a common-mode voltage of 2.5 V . Because the differential gain \nmagnitude is 9, the maximum input signal before saturation is \n±275 mV or +550 mV p-p. Overload protection ensures quick recovery time from large input voltages. Because the inputs are capacitively coupled to a bias voltage near midsupply, very large \ninputs can be handled without interacting with the ESD protection.  \nLow value feedback resistors and the current-driving capability \nof the output stage allow the LNA to achieve a low input-referred \nvoltage noise of 0.74 nV/√Hz. This is achieved with a current \nconsumption of only 11 mA per channel (55 mW). On-chip resistor matching results in precise single-ended gains of 4.5× (9× differential), critical for accurate impedance control. The use of a fully differential topology and negative feedback minimizes \ndistortion. Low HD2 is particularly important in second harmonic \nultrasound imaging applications. Differential signaling enables smaller swings at each output , further reducing third-order \ndistortion. \n   \nAD8331/AD8332/AD8334 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. I | Page 26 of 55 Active Impedance Matching  \nThe LNA supports active impedance matching through an external  \nshunt feedback resistor from Pin LON to Pin INH. The input \nresistance, R IN, is given in  Equation 5, where A is the single -\nended gain of 4.5, and 6 k Ω is the unterminated input i mpedance.  \nIZIZ IZ\nINRR\nARR+×=+=kΩ33kΩ6kΩ61 (5) \nCIZ is needed in series with R IZ because the dc levels at Pin LON \nand Pin INH are unequal. Expressions for choosing R IZ in terms \nof R IN and for choosing C IZ are found in the  Applications \nInformation  section. C SH and the ferrite bead enhance stability \nat higher frequencies , where the loop gain is diminished , and \nprevent  peaking. Frequency  response plots of the LNA are shown \nin Figure 23 and Figure 24. The bandwidth is approx imately \n130 MHz for matched input impedances of 50 Ω  to 200 Ω  and \ndeclines at higher source impedances. The unterminated bandwidth (when R\nIZ = ∞) is a pproximately 80 MHz.  \nEach output can drive external loads as low as 100 Ω  in addition \nto the 100 Ω  input impedance of the VGA (200 Ω  differential). \nCapac itive loading up to 10 pF is permissible. All loads should \nbe ac -coupled. Typically, Pin LOP output is used as a single -ended  \ndriver for auxi liary circuits, such as those used for Doppler \nultrasound imaging . Pin LON drives R IZ. Alternatively, a \ndifferential ex ternal circuit can be driven from the two ou tputs \nin addition to the active feedback termination. In both cases, important stability considerations discussed in the  Applications \nInformation  section should be carefully observed. \nThe impedance at each LNA output is 5 Ω . A 0.4 dB reduction \nin open circuit gain results when driving the VGA, and  a 0.8 dB \nreduction results with an additional 100 Ω  load at the output. \nThe differential gain of the LNA is 6 dB higher. If the load is less than 200 Ω on either side, a compensating load is recommended  \non the opposite output.  \nLNA Noise  \nThe input -referred voltage noise sets an important limit on \nsystem performance. The short -circuit input vol tage noise of \nthe LNA is 0.74 nV/ √Hz or 0.82 nV/ √Hz (a t maxi mum gain), \nincluding the VGA noise. The open circuit , current noise is \n2.5 pA/√Hz. These measur ements, taken without a feedback \nresistor, provide the basis for calculating the input noise and noise figure performance of the configur ations in Figure 75. \nFigure 76 and Figure 77 show  simulations extracted from these \nresults and the 4.1 dB noise figure ( NF) measurement with the \ninput actively matched to a 50 Ω source. Untermi nated (R\nIZ = ∞) \noperation exhibits the lowest equivalent input noise and noise \nfigure. Figure 76 shows the noise figure vs. source resistance, \nrising at low R S, where the LNA voltage noise is large compared \nto the source noise, a nd again at high R S due to current noise. \nThe VGA  input-referred voltage noise of 2.7 nV/ √Hz is \nincluded in all of the curve s.

I | Page 27 of 55 The primary purpose of input impedance matching is to \nimprove the system transient response. With resis tive termination,  \nthe input noise increases due to the thermal noise of the matching  \nresistor and the inc reased contribution of the LNA  input voltage \nnoise generator. With active impedance matching, however, the \ncontrib utions of both are smaller than they would be for resistive  \ntermination by a factor of 1/(1 + LNA Gain ). Figure 76 shows \ntheir relative NF performance. In thi s graph, the input impedance  \nis swept with R S to pr eserve the match at each point. The noise \nfigures for a s ource impe dance of 50 Ω are 7.1 dB, 4.1 dB, and \n2.5 dB, respectively, for the resistive, active, and unterminated configurations. The noise figures for 200 Ω are 4.6 dB, 2.0 dB, and 1.0 dB, respe ctively.  \nFigure 77 is a plot of  NF vs. R\nS for various va lues of R IN, which is \nhelpful for design purposes. The plateau in the NF for actively matched inputs mitigates source impedance variations. For \ncomparison purposes, a preamp with a gain of 19 dB and noise \nspectral de nsity of 1.0 nV/√Hz, combined with a VGA  with \n3.75 nV/√Hz, yields a noise figure degradation of approximately \n1.5 dB (for most input impedances), significantly worse than the AD8331/ AD8332/ AD8334 performance . \nThe equivalent input noise of the LNA is the same for single-ended and differential output applications. The LNA noise fi gure \nimproves to 3.5 dB at 50 Ω without VGA noise, but this is exclusive of noise contributions from other external circuits connected to LOP . A series output resistor is usually reco m-\nmended for stability purposes when driving external circuits on a separate board (see the  Applications Information  section). In \nlow noise applications, a ferrite bead is even more desirable.  \nVARIABLE GAIN AMPLIF IER \nThe differential X -AMP VGA provides precise input attenu ation \nand interpolation. It has a low input -referred noise of 2.7 nV/√Hz \nand excellent gain linearity.  A simplified block dia gram is shown \nin Figure 78. \n03199-078VIPGAIN\nR6dB\n2R\n200Ω48dB\nVINgm\nPOSTAMPPOSTAMP+\n–GAIN INTERPOLATOR\n(BOTH CHANNELS)\n \nFigure 78. Simplified VGA Schematic \n X-AMP VGA  \nThe input of the VGA is a different ial R -2R ladder attenuator \nnetwork with 6 dB steps per stage and a net input impedance of 200 Ω di fferential. The ladder is driven by a fully differential \ninput signal from the LNA and is not intended for single -ended \noperation. LNA ou tputs are ac -coupled to reduce offset and isolate  \ntheir common -mode voltage. The VGA inputs  are biased through  \nthe center tap connection of the ladder to VCM, which is typically  \nset to 2.5 V and is bypassed externally to provide a clean ac ground.  \nThe signal level at successiv e stages in the input attenuator  \nfalls from 0 dB to −48 dB in + 6 dB steps. The input stages of the \nX-AMP are distributed along the ladder, and a biasing interpolator, \ncontrolled by the gain interface, determines the input tap point. With overla pping bias currents, signals from successive taps \nmerge to provide a smooth attenuation range from 0 dB to −48 dB. This circuit  technique results in excellent  linear -in-dB \ngain law confo rmance and low distortion levels and deviates \n±0.2 dB or less from the ideal. The gain slope is monotonic with \nrespect to the control voltage and is stable with variations in \nprocess, temper ature, and supply.  \nThe X -AMP inputs are part of a gain -of-12 feedback amplifier \nthat completes the VGA. Its bandwidth is 150 MHz. The input \nstage is designed to reduce feedthrough t o the output and to \nensure excellent frequency response uniformity across gain \nsetting (see Figure 12 and Figure 13). \nGain Control  \nPosition alon g the VGA attenuator is control led by a single -ended  \nanalo g control voltage, V GAIN, with an input range of 40  mV to \n1.0 V . The gain control scaling is trimmed to a slope of 50 dB/V \n(20 mV/dB). Values of V GAIN beyond the control range saturate \nto minimum or max imum gain values. Both channels of the \nAD8332 are controlled from a single gain inte rface to preserve \nmatching. Gain can be calculated using Equation 1 and Equation 2.  \nGain accuracy is very good because both the scaling factor and absolute gain are factory trimmed. The overall acc uracy relative \nto the theoretical gain expression is ± 1 dB for variations in \ntemperature, process, supply voltage, interpol ator gain ripple, \ntrim errors, and tester limit s. The gain error relative to a best -fit \nline for a given set of conditions is typically ±0.2 dB. Gain matching  \nbetween channels is better than 0.1 dB ( Figure 11 shows gain errors  \nin the center of the co ntrol rang e). When V\nGAIN < 0.1 or > 0.95, \ngain errors are slightly greater.  \nThe gain slope can be inverted, as shown in Figure 73 (except for \nthe AD8332 AR models ). The gain drops with a slope of −50  dB/V  \nacross the gain control range from maximum to minimum gain. This slope is useful in applications  such as automatic gain co ntrol, \nwhere the control voltage is proportional to the measured output  \nsignal amplitude. The  inverse gain mode is selected by setting the \nMODE pin to HI gain mode . \nGain control response time is less than 750 ns to settle within 10% of the final value for a change from minimum to maximum gain.  \nAD8331/AD8332/AD8334 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. I | Page 28 of 55 VGA Noise  \nIn a typical application, a VGA compresses a  wide dynamic \nrange input signal to within the input span of an ADC. While \nthe input -referred noise of the LNA limits the minimum resolvable \ninput signal, the output -referred noise, which depends pr imarily \non the VGA, limits the maximum instantaneous d ynam ic range \nthat can be processed at any one particular gain control voltage. This limit is set in accordance with the quant ization noise floor \nof the ADC.  \nOutput - and input -referred noise as a function of V\nGAIN are plotted  \nin Figure 25 and Figure 27 for the short circuited input co nditions . \nThe input noise voltage is simply equal to the output noise divided \nby the measured gain at each point in the control range.  \nThe outpu t-referred noise is f lat over most of the gain range  \nbecause it is dominated by the fixed output -referred noise of the \nVGA. Values are 48 nV/√Hz in LO gain mode and 178 nV/√Hz \nin HI gain mode. At the high end of the gain control range, the noise of the LNA  and the noise of the source prevail. The input -\nreferred noise reaches its minimum value near the maximum \ngain control voltage, where the input -referred contribution of \nthe VGA b ecomes very small. \nAt lower gains, the input -referred noise, and thus noise fi gure, \nincreases as the gain decreases. The instantaneous dynamic \nrange of the system is not lost, however, because the input capacity increases with it. The contribution of the ADC noise \nfloor has the same dependence as well. The important relationship  \nis the magnitude of the VGA output noise floor relative to that \nof the ADC.  \nWith its low output- referred noise levels, these devices ideally \ndrive low voltage ADCs. The converter noise floor drops 12 dB \nfor eve ry two  bits of resolution and drops at lower inpu t full -\nscale voltages and higher sampling rates. ADC qua ntization \nnoise is discussed in the  Applications Information  section.  \nThe preceding noise performance discussion applies to a \ndiffe rential VGA output signal. Although the LNA  noise \nperformance is the same in single -ended and differential \napplications, the VGA performance is not. The noise of the \nVGA is significantly higher in single -ended usage because the \ncontribution of its bias noise is designed to cancel in the differentia l \nsignal. A tran sformer can be used with single -ended applications  \nwhen low noise is desired.  \nGain control noise is a concern in very low noise applications. Thermal noise in the gain control interface can mod ulate the \nchannel gain. The resultant noise is proportional to the output signal level and usually only evident when a large signal is present.  \nIts effect is obser vable only in LO gain mode where the noise \nfloor is substantially lower. The gain interface includes an  \non-chip noise filter, which reduces  this effect significantly at \nfrequencies above 5 MHz. Care should be taken to minimize \nnoise impinging at the GAIN input. An external RC filter can be used to remove V\nGAIN source noise. The filter bandwidth  should be \nsufficient to accommodate the desired control ban dwidth.  Common -Mode Biasing  \nAn internal bias network connected to a midsupply voltage establishes common -mode voltages in the VGA and postamp. \nAn externally bypassed buffer maintains the voltage. The bypass capacitors form an  important ac ground  connection because  \nthe VCM network makes a number of important connections internally, inclu ding the center tap of the VGA differential input \nattenuator, the feedback network of the VGA fixed gain ampl ifier, \nand the feedback network of the postamp in bot h gain settings. \nFor best results, use a 1 nF capacitor and a 0.1 µF capacitor in \nparallel, with the 1 nF capacitor nearest to the VCM pin. Separate \nVCM pins are pr ovided for each channel. For dc coupling  to a 3  V \nADC, the output common -mode voltage is adj usted to 1.5  V by \nbiasing the VCM pin.  \nPOSTAMPLIFIER  \nThe final stage has a selectable gain of 3.5 dB (×1.5) or 15.5 dB (×6), set by the HILO  logic pin . Figure 79 is a simpl ified block \ndiagram.  \n03199-079Gm2+\n–\nGm1VOH\nVOLVCMGm1\nGm2F1F2\n \nFigure 79. Postamplifier Block Diagram  \nSeparate feedback attenuators implement the two gain settings. \nThese are selected in conjunction with an appropriately scaled \ninput stage to maintain a constant 3 dB bandwidth between the two gain modes (~150 MHz). The slew ra te is 1200 V/µs in HI gain  \nmode and 300 V/µs in LO gain mode. The feedback networks for HI and LO gain modes are factory trimmed to adjust the absolute gains of each cha nnel. \nNoise  \nThe topology of the postamp  provides constant input -referred \nnoise with the  two gain settings and variable output- referred \nnoise. The output -referred noise in HI gain mode i ncreases  \n(with gain) by four. This setting is recommended when driving \nconverters with higher noise floors. The extra gain boosts the output signal levels an d noise floor appro priately.  When driving \ncircuits with lower input noise floors, the LO gain mode optimizes \nthe output dynamic range.  \nAlthough the quantization noise floor of an ADC depends on a \nnumber of factors, the 48 nV/√ Hz and 178 nV/ √Hz levels are \nwell suited to the average requirements of most 12 -bit and 10 -bit \nconverters, respectively. An additional technique, described in the Applications Information  section, can extend the noise floor \neven lower for possible use with 14 -bit ADCs.  \nData Sheet  AD8331/AD8332/AD8334 \n \nRev.

Suggested values for C SH for 50 Ω ≤ R IN ≤ 200 Ω are \nshown in Table 7. \nWhen a long trace to Pin INH is unavoidable, or if both LNA \noutputs drive external circuits, a small ferrite bead ( FB) in series \nwith Pin INH preserves circuit stability with negligible effect on noise. The bead shown is 75 Ω at 100 MHz (Murata BLM21 or equivalent). Other values can prove useful.  \nFigure 82 shows the interconnection details o f the LNA output. \nCapac itive coupling between the LNA outputs and the VGA \ninputs is required because of the differences in their dc levels \nand the need to eliminate the offset of the LNA. Capacitor values  \nof 0.1 µF are recommended. There is a 0.4 dB loss i n gain \nbetween the LNA output and the VGA input due to the 5 Ω output resistance.

If an LNA output is routed to a remote PC board, it tolerates a load capacitance up \nto 100 pF with the addition of a 49.9 Ω series resistor or ferrite \n75 Ω/100 MHz bead.  \n \n \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD8331/AD8332/AD8334 \n \nRev. I | Page 31 of 55 Gain Input  \nThe GAIN pin is common to both channels of t he AD8332. The \ninput impedance is nominally 10 MΩ , and a bypass c apacitor \nfrom 100 pF to  1 nF is recommended.  \nParallel connected devices can be driven by a common vol tage \nsource or DAC. Decoupling should take into account any band -\nwidth consider ations of the drive waveform, using the total \ndistributed capacitance.  \nIf gain control noise in LO gain mode becomes a factor, main -\ntaining ≤15 nV/√Hz n oise at the GAIN pin ensures satisfa ctory \nnoise performance. Internal noise prevails below 15  nV/√Hz at \nthe GAIN pin. Gain control noise is negligible in HI gain mode.  \nVCM Input  \nThe common -mode voltage of Pin VCM, Pin VOL, and Pin VOH  \ndefaults to 2.5 V dc.  With output ac -coupled applications, the \nVCM pin is unterminated; however, it must still be bypassed in \nclose proximity for ac grounding of internal ci rcuitry. The VGA \noutputs can be dc connected to a differential load, such as an ADC. Common -mode output voltage levels between 1.5 V and \n3.5 V can be realized at Pin VOH and Pin VOL by applying the desired voltage at Pin VCM. DC -coupled oper ation is not \nrecommended when driving loads on a separate PC board.  \nThe voltage on the VCM pin is sourced by an interna l buffer \nwith an output impedance of 30 Ω and a ±2 mA default output \ncurrent (see Figure 83). If the VCM pin is driven from an external  \nsource, its output impedance should be <<30 Ω , and its current \ndrive cap ability should be >>2 mA. If the VCM pins of several \ndevices are connected in parallel, the external buffer should be \ncapable of overcoming their collective output currents. When a \ncommon -mode voltage other than 2.5 V is used, a voltage -\nlimiting resistor, R\nCLMP, is needed to protect against ove rload.  03199-083VCMNEW V CM RO << 30Ω\n100pF2mA MAX\n30Ω\n0.1µFINTERNAL\nCIRCUITRY\nAC GROUNDING FOR\nINTERNAL CIRCUITRY \nFigure 83. VCM Interface \nLogic Inputs —ENB, MODE, and HILO  \nThe input impedance of all enable pins is nominally 25 kΩ and can be pulled up to 5 V (a pull -up resistor is reco mmended) or \ndriven by any 3 V or 5 V logic families. The enabl e pin, ENB, \npowers down the VGA; when pulled low, the VGA output voltages  \nare nea r ground. Multiple devices can be driven from a common \nsource.  Consult Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 for infor -\nmation about circuit fun ctions controlled by the e nable pins.  \nPin HILO is compatible with 3 V or 5 V CMOS logic families. It is either connected to ground or pulled up to 5 V , depending on the d esired gain range and output noise.  Optional Output Voltage Limiting  \nThe RCLMP pin pr ovides the user with a means to limit the \noutput voltage swing when used with loads that have no provisions for prevention of input overdrive. The peak -to-peak \nlimited voltage is adjusted by a resistor to ground  (see Table 8 \nfor a list of seve ral voltage levels and  corresponding resistor \nvalue s). Unconnected, the default limiting level is 4.5 V p -p. \nNote that third harmonic distortion increases as waveform \namplitudes approach clipping. For lowest distortion, the clamp level \nshould  be set higher than the converter input span. A clamp  level \nof 1.5 V p -p is recommended for a 1 V p -p linear output range, \n2.7 V p -p for a 2 V p -p range, or 1 V p -p for a 0.5  V p-p operation.  \nThe best solution is determined e xperimentally. Figure 84 shows  \nthird harmonic distortion as a fun ction of the limiting level for \na 2 V p -p output signal.

These components can be incor porated into a Nyquist filter such as \nthe one shown in Figure 81. In Figure 81, the resistor value is \n84.5 Ω. For example, all the evaluation boards for this series \nincorporate  100 Ω in parallel with a 120  nH bead. Lower value \nresistors are permissible  for applications with nearby loads or \nAD8331/AD8332/AD8334 Data Sheet\n \nRev. I | Page 32 of 55 with gains less than 40 dB. The exact values of these components \ncan be selected empirically. \nAn antialiasing noise filter is typically used with an ADC. Filter \nrequirements are application dependent. \nWhen the ADC resides on a separate board, the majority of \nfilter components should be placed nearby to suppress noise picked up between boards and to mitigate charge kickback from the ADC inputs. Any series resistance beyond that required for \noutput stability should be placed on the ADC board. Figure 85 \nshows a second-order, low-pass filter with a bandwidth of 20 MHz. The capacitor is chosen in conjunction with the 10 pF input \ncapacitance of the ADC.  \n03199-08518pFOPTIONAL\nBACKPLANE\n0.1µF\n0.1µF ADC84.5Ω\n84.5Ω158Ω\n158Ω 1.5µH1.5µH\n \nFigure 85. 20 MHz Second-Order, Low-Pass Filter \nDRIVING ADCs \nThe output drive accommodates a wide range of ADCs. The \nnoise floor requirements of the VGA depend on a number of \napplication factors, including bit resolution, sampling rate, full-\nscale voltage, and the bandwidth of the noise/antialias filter. The output noise floor and gain range can be adjusted by selecting \nHI or LO gain mode. \nThe relative noise and distortion performance of the two gain \nmodes can be compared in Figure 25 and Figure 31 through Figure 41. The 48 nV/√Hz noise floor of the LO gain mode is \nsuited to converters with higher sampling rates or resolutions \n(such as 12 bits). Both gain modes can accommodate ADC full-scale voltages as high as 4 V p-p. Because distortion performance remains favorable for output voltages as high as 4 V p-p (see Figure 36), it is possible to lower the output-referred noise even \nfurther by using a resistive attenuator (or transformer) at the \noutput. The circuit in Figure 86 has an output full-scale range of 2 V p-p, a gain range of −10.5 dB to +37.5 dB, and an output noise floor of 24 nV/√Hz, making it suitable for some 14-bit \nADC applications. \n03199-086ADC\nAD6644187Ω\n2:1\n187Ω374ΩVOH\nVOLLPF4V p-p DIFF,\n48nV/  Hz2V p-p DIFF,\n24nV/  Hz\n \nFigure 86. Adjusting the Noise Floor for 14-Bit ADCs \nOVERLOAD \nThese devices respond gracefully to large signals that overload \nits input stage and to normal signals that overload the VGA \nwhen the gain is set unexpectedly high. Each stage is designed for clean-limited overload waveforms and fast recovery when \ngain setting or input amplitude is reduced. Signals larger than ±275 mV at the LNA input are clipped to \n5 V p-p differential prior to the input of the VGA. Figure 48 shows the response to a 1 V p-p input burst. The symmetric overload waveform is important for applications, such as CW \nDoppler ultrasound, where the spectrum of the LNA outputs \nduring overload is critical. The input stage is also designed to accommodate signals as high as ±2.5 V without triggering the \nslow-settling ESD input protection diodes. \nBoth stages of the VGA are susceptible to overload. Post-\namplifier limiting is more common and results in the clean-limited output characteristics found in Figure 49. Recovery is fast in \nall cases. The graph in Figure 87 summarizes the combinations of \ninput signal and gain that lead to the different types of overload. \n03199-087GAIN (dB)\n1mLO GAIN\nMODE15mV\n–4.525mV\nLNA OVERLOADX-AMP\nOVERLOADPOSTAMP\nOVERLOADX-AMP\nOVERLOADPOSTAMP\nOVERLOAD\n29dB43.5\nINPUT AMPLITUDE (V)0.275 0.1 10m24.5dB\nGAIN (dB)\nHI GAIN\nMODE4mV\n7.525mV\nLNA OVERLOAD41dB56.5\nINPUT AMPLITUDE (V)24.5dB\n1 1m 0.275 0.1 10m 1\n \nFigure 87. Overload Gain and Signal Conditions \nThe clamp interface mentioned in the Output Clamping section \ncontrols the maximum output swing of the postamp and its \noverload response. When the clamp feature is not used, the output level defaults to approximately 4.5 V p-p differential centered at 2.5 V common mode. When other common-mode levels are set through the VCM pin, the value of R\nCLMP should be \nselected for graceful overload. A value of 8.3 kΩ or less is recommended for 1.5 V or 3.5 V common-mode levels (7.2 kΩ for HI gain mode). This limits the output swing to just above \n2 V p-p differential. \nOPTIONAL INPUT OVERLOAD PROTECTION \nApplications in which high transients are applied to the LNA \ninput can benefit from the use of clamp diodes. A pair of back-\nto-back Schottky diodes can reduce these transients to manageable levels. Figure 88 illustrates how such a diode protection scheme can be connected. \n03199-08820\n19\n432\nLONVPSLINHCOMM\nENBL0.1µF FB\nRSHCIZ\nRIZ CSH\n23\n1OPTIONAL\nSCHOTTKY\nOVERLOAD\nCLAMP\nBAS40-04 \nFigure 88.

Many variations of these specifications can \nbe found in vendor catalogs. \nLAYOUT, GROUNDING, AND BYPASSING \nDue to their excellent high frequency characteristics, these \ndevices are sensitive to their PCB environments. Realizing \nexpected performance requires attention to detail critical to \ngood, high speed, board design. \nA multilayer board with power and ground planes is recom-\nmended with blank areas in the signal layers filled with ground plane. Be certain that the power and ground pins provided for robust power distribution to the device are connected. Decouple \nthe power supply pins with surface-mount capacitors as close as \npossible to each pin to minimize impedance paths to ground. Decouple the LNA power pins from the VGA supply using ferrite beads. Together with the capacitors, ferrite beads eliminate undesired high frequencies without reducing the headroom. Use a larger value capacitor for every 10 chips to \n20 chips to decouple residual low frequency noise. To minimize \nvoltage drops, use a 5 V regulator for the VGA array. \nSeveral critical LNA areas require special care. The LON and \nLOP output traces must be as short as possible before connecting  to the coupling capacitors connected to Pin VIN and Pin VIP .  R\nIZ must be placed near the LON pin as well. Resistors must be \nplaced as close as possible to the VGA output pins, VOL and \nVOH, to mitigate loading effects of connecting traces. Values \nare discussed in the Output Decoupling section. \nSignal traces must be short and direct to avoid parasitic effects. \nWherever there are complementary signals, symmetrical layout should be employed to maintain waveform balance. PCB traces should be kept adjacent when running differential signals over a \nlong distance. \nMULTIPLE INPUT MATCHING \nMatching of multiple sources with dissimilar impedances can be \naccomplished as shown in Figure 89. A relay and low supply voltage \nanalog switch can be used to select between multiple sources \nand their associated feedback resistors. An ADG736  dual SPDT \nswitch is shown in this example; however, multiple switches are also available and users are referred to the Analog Devices \nSelection Guide  for switches and multiplexers. \n03199-090INH\nLNA5Ω\n200Ω\n50ΩLMDLOPADG736\nLON\n0.1µF18nF280Ω1.13kΩ\nAD83325ΩSELECT RIZ\n \nFigure 89.

I | Page 39 of 55 AD8331 EVALUATION BOARD\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD8331 evaluation board is a platform for testing and \nevaluating the AD8331 variable gain amplifier (VGA). The \nboard is provided completely assembled and tested; the user \nsimply connects an input signal, VGAIN sources, and a 5 V \npower supply. The AD8331-EV ALZ  is lead free and RoHS \ncompliant. Figure 95 is a photograph of the board. \nUSER-SUPPLIED OPTIONAL COMPONENTS \nAs shown in the schematic in Figure 96, the board provides for optional components. The components shown in black are for \ntypical operation, and the components shown in gray are \ninstalled at the user’s discretion. \nAs shipped, the LNA input impedance of the AD8331-EV ALZ is \nconfigured for 50 Ω to accommodate most signal generators and \nnetwork analyzers. Input impedances up to 6 kΩ are realized by changing the values of RFB and CSH. Refer to the Theory of \nOperation section for details on this circuit feature. See Table 9 \nfor typical values of input impedance and corresponding \ncomponents.  \nTable 9.

At R4 and R8, 0 Ω resistors \nare installed unless capacitive loads larger than 10 pF are connected \nto the SMA connectors LON and LOP (such as coaxial cables). In that event, small value resistors (68 Ω to 100 Ω) must be \ninstalled at R4 and R8 to preserve the stability of the amplifier. \nA resistor can be inserted at RCLMP if output clamping is \ndesired. Refer to Table 8 for appropriate values. \n03199-115 \nFigure 95. Photograph of AD8331-EVALZ  \nMEASUREMENT SETUP \nThe basic board connection for measuring bandwidth is shown \nin Figure 97. A 5 V , 100 mA minimum power supply and a low \nnoise, voltage reference supply for GAIN are required. Table 10 lists jumpers, and Figure 97 shows their functions and positions. \nThe preferred signal detection method is a differential probe \nconnected to VO, as shown in Figure 97. Single-ended loads can be \nconnected using the board edge SMA connector, VOH. Be sure to take into account the 25.8 dB attenuation incurred when using the board in this manner. For connection to an ADC, the 270 Ω series \nresistors can be replaced with 0 Ω or other appropriate values. \nTable 10.

The board is shipped \nassembled and teste d, and users need only  connect the signal \nand VGAIN  source s to a single 5 V power supply. Figure 104 is a \nphotograph of the component side of the board, and Figure 105 \nshows  the schematic.  The AD8332- EVA L Z  is lead free and \nRoHS compliant . \n03199-131 \nFigure 104 .Photograph o f the AD8332 -EVALZ  \nUSER -SUPPLIED OPTIONAL CO MPONENTS  \nThe board is built and tested using the components shown in \nblack in Figure 105. Provisions are made for optional components  \n(shown in gray) that can  be installed for testing  at user discretion.  \nThe d efault LNA input impedance is 50 Ω to match various \nsignal generators and network analyzers. Input impedances up to \n6 kΩ are realized by changing the values of RFBx and CSHx.  For \nreference, Table 11 lists the common input impedan ce values \nand corresponding adjustments. The board is designed for 0603 size, surface -mount co mponents.  Table 11. LNA External Component Values for Common \nSource Impedances  \nRIN (Ω) RFB1, RFB2 (Ω  Std 1% Value)  CSH1, CSH2  (pF) \n50 274 22 \n75 412 12 \n100 562 8 \n200 1.13 k  1.2 \n500 3.01 k  None  \n6 k ∞ None  \nSMA connectors, S2, S3, S6, and S7, are provided for access to the LNA outputs or the VGA inputs. If the LNA is used alone, 0.1 µF coupling capacitors can be i nstalled at the C5, C9, C23, \nand C24  locations . Resistors of 68 Ω to 100 Ω may  be required \nif the load capacitances, as seen by the LNA outputs, are larger than approximately 10 pF.  \nA resistor can be inserted at RCLMP if output clamping is d esired.  \nThe peak -to-peak clamping level is adjusted by insta lling one of \nthe standard 1% resistor values listed in Table 8. \nA high frequency diffe rential probe connected to the 2-pin headers , \nVOx , is the preferred method to observe a waveform at the VGA \noutput. A typical setup is shown in Figure 106. Single -ended loads  \ncan be co nnected directly via the board edge SMA connectors. \nNote that the AD8332 output amplifier is buffered with 237 Ω \nresistors; therefore, be sure to compensate for attenuation if low impedances are connected to the output SMAs.  \nMEASUREMENT SETUP  \nThe basic board connections for measuring bandwidth are shown in Figure 106.

The board is shipped  \nassembled and test ed, and users need only connect the signal \nand VGAIN source s and a single 5 V power supply. Figure 113 \nis a photograph of the board.  The AD8334- EVA L Z  is lead free \nand RoHS compl iant. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n03199-122 \nFigure 113 . AD8334- EVA LZ Top View  \n  \nAD8331/AD8332/AD8334 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. I | Page 48 of 55 CONFIGURING THE INPU T IMPEDANCE  \nThe board is built and tested using the  components shown in \nblack in Figure 115. Provisions are made for optional components  \n(shown in gr ay) that can be installed at  user discretion.  As \nshipped, the input impedances of the low noise amplifiers (LNAs) \nare configured for 50 Ω to match the output impedance s of most \nsignal generators and network analyzers. Input impedances up to \n6 kΩ can be realized by changing the values of the feedback \nresistors, R FB1, R FB2, RFB3, R FB4, and shunt capacitors, C6, C8, C10, \nand C12.  For reference, Table 12 lists standard values of 1% \nresistors for some typical values of input impedance. Of course, if the user has determined that the source impedance falls between these values, the feedback resistor value can be \ncalculated accordingly. Note that the board is designed to accept \nstandard surface -mount, size 0603 components. \nTable 12. LNA External Component Value s for Common \nSource Impedances  \nRIN (Ω) RFB1, RFB2, RFB3, RFB4 (Ω, ±1%)  C6, C8, C10, C12 (pF)  \n50 274 22 \n75 412 12 \n100 562 8 \n200 1.13 k  1.2 \n500 3.01 k  No capacitor  \n6 k No resistor  No capacitor  \nDriving  the VGA from an External Source  or Using the \nLNA t o Drive an External Load  \nAppropriate components ca n be installed if the user want s to \ndrive the VGA directly from an external source or to evaluate the LNA output. If the LNA is used to drive off -board loads  \nor cables, small value series resistors (47 Ω t o 100 Ω) are \nrecommended for LNA decoupling. These can be installed  \nin the R10, R11, R14, R15, R18, R19, R22, and R23 spaces.  \nProvisions are made for surface -mount SMA connectors that \ncan be used for driving from either direction. If the LNA is not used, it is recommended that the capacitors, C16, C17, C21, \nC22, C26, C27, C31, and C32, be carefully removed to avoid driving the outputs of the LNAs.  \nUsing the Clamp Circuit  \nThe board is shipped with no resistors installed in the spaces \nprovided for clamp -circuit operation. Note that each pair of \nchannels shares a clamp resistor. If the output clamping is \ndesired, the resistors are installed in R49 and R50. The peak -to-\npeak clamping level is application dependent. \n \n \n \n \n Viewing Signals  \nThe preferred signal detec tor is a high impedance differential \nprobe, such as the Tektronix P6247, 1 GHz differential probe, \nconnected to the 2 -pin headers (VO1, VO2, VO3, or VO4), as \nshown in Figure 116. The low capacitance of this probe has the \nleast eff ect on the performance of the device of any detection \nmethod tried. The probe can also be used for monitoring input signals at IN 1, IN2, IN3, or IN4. It can  be used for probing \nother circuit nodes; however, be aware that the 200 kΩ input impedance can affect certain circuits.  \nDifferential -to-single -ended transformers are provided for \nsingle -ended output connections. Note that series resistors are \nprovided to protect against accidental output overload should a 50 Ω load be connected to the connector. Of course, the effect of these resistors is to limit the bandwidth. If the load connected to the SMA is > 500 Ω, the 237 Ω series resistors, RX1, RX2, RX3, \nRX4, RX5 , RX6, RX7, and RX8, can be replaced with 0 Ω values.  \n03199-123 \nFigure 114 . AD8334- EVALZ  Assembly  \nMEASUREMENT SETUP  \nThe basic board connections for measuring bandwidth are shown in Figure 116. A 5 V , 200 mA (minimum) power supply \nis required, and a low noise voltage reference supply is required for VGAIN.  \nBOARD LAYOUT  \nThe evaluation board circuitry uses four conductor layers. The two inner l ayers are ground, and all interconnecting circuitry is \nlocated on the outer layers .
