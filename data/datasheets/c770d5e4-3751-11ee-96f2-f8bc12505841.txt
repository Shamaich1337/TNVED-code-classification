The driver is available with either TTLor CMOS input thresholds. Internal circuitry provides an\nunder−voltage lockout function by holding the output LOW until the\nsupply voltage is within the operating range. In addition, the driversfeature matched internal propagation delays between A and B\nchannels for applications requiring dual gate drives with critical\ntiming , such as synchronous rectifiers. This also enables connecting\ntwo drivers in parallel to effectively double the current capabilitydriving a single MOSFET.\nThe FAN322X drivers incorporate MillerDrive ™ architecture for\nthe final output stage. This bipolar −MOSFET combination provides\nhigh current during the Miller plateau stage of the MOSFET turn −on /\nturn−off process to minimize switching loss, while providing\nrail−to−rail voltage swing and reverse current capability.\nThe FAN3223 offers two inverting drivers and the FAN3224 offers\ntwo non−inverting drivers. Each device has dual independent enable\npins that default to ON if not connected . In the F AN3225, each channel\nhas dual inputs of opposite polarity , which allows configuration as\nnon−inverting or inverting with an optional enable function using the\nsecond input. If one or both inputs are left unconnected, internalresistors bias the inputs such that the output is pulled LOW to hold the\npower MOSFET OFF .\nFeatures\n•Industry−Standard Pinouts\n•4.5 V to 18 V Operating Range\n•5 A Peak Sink/Source at V DD = 12 V\n•4.3 A Sink / 2.8  A Source at V OUT  = 6 V\n•Choice of TTL or CMOS Input Thresholds\n•Three Versions of Dual Independent Drivers:\n♦Dual Inverting + Enable (FAN3223)\n♦Dual Non −Inverting + Enable (FAN3224)\n♦Dual−Inputs (F AN3225)\n•Internal Resistors Turn Driver Off If No Inputs\n•MillerDrive Technology\n•12 ns / 9  ns Typical Rise/Fall Times (2.2  nF Load)\n•Under 2 0 ns Typical Propagation Delay Matched within 1 ns to the\nOther Channel\n•Double Current Capability by Paralleling Channels\n•8−Lead SOIC and 8 −Lead SOIC Exposed Pad Package\n•Rated from –40 °C to +125 °C Ambient\n•Automotive Qualified to AEC -Q100\n•These are Pb −Free Devices\nwww. onsemi.com\nMARKING DIAGRAMSSOIC−8 EP\nCASE 751AC\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information on page 21 of\nthis data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATION18SOIC8\nCASE 751EB18\nSOIC−8 EP\nApplications\n•Switch−Mode Power  Supplies\n•High -Efficiency MOSFET Switching\n•Synchronous Rectifier Circuits\n•DC-to-DC Converters\n•Motor Control\n•Automotive -Qualified Systems\nRelated Resources\n•AN−6069 — Application Review and \nComparative Evaluation of Low −Side Gate\nDrivers(Note: Microdot may be in either location)18\nXXXXX\nAYWW /C0071\n/C0071\nXXX = Specific Device Code\nA = Assembly Lot Code\nY = YearWW = Work Week\n/C0071 = Pb−Free Package\n$Y = ON Semiconductor Logo Graphic\n&Z = Assembly Plant Code&2 = 2−Digit Date Code (Year and Week)\n&K = 2−Digit Lot Run Traceability CodeSOIC818\n$Y&Z&2&K\nFAN\nXXXXX\nFAN3223/FAN3224/FAN3225\nwww. onsemi.com\n2PACKAGE OUTLINES\n2\n38\n61\n47\n52\n38\n61\n47\n5\nFigure 1.

In the FAN3223 and F AN3224 ,\nchannels A and B can be enabled or disabled independently\nusing ENA or ENB, respectively. The EN pin has TTL\nthresholds for parts with either CMOS or TTL inputthresholds. If ENA and ENB are not connected, an internal\npull−up resistor enables the driver channels by default. ENA\nand ENB have TTL thresholds in parts with either TTL orCMOS INx threshold.\nIf the channel A and channel B inputs and outputs are\nconnected in parallel to increase the driver current capacity,\nENA and ENB should be connected and driven together. In\naddition, it is recommended to include an individual gateresistance for each channel output to limit the shoot through\ncurrent possibly happening between the two channels due to\nvariations in propagation delay or in input thresholdbetween the two channels.\nThe FAN322x family offers versions in either TTL or\nCMOS input thresholds. In the FAN322xT , the input\nthresholds meet industry -standard TTL -logic thresholds\nindependent of the V\nDD voltage, and there is a hysteresis\nvoltage of approximately 0.4 V . These levels permit theinputs to be driven from a range of input logic signal levels\nfor which a voltage over 2 V is considered logic HIGH. Thedriving signal for the TTL inputs should have fast rising and\nfalling edges with a slew rate of 6 V/ µs or faster, so a rise\ntime from 0 to 3.3 V should be 550 ns or less. With reducedslew rate , circuit noise could cause the driver input voltage\nto exceed the hysteresis voltage and retrigger the driverinput, causing erratic operation.\nIn the FAN322xC , the logic input thresholds are\ndependent on the V\nDD level and , with V DD of 12 V , the logic\nrising edge threshold is approximately 55% of V DD and the\ninput falling edge threshold is approximately 38% of V DD.\nThe CMOS input configuration of fers a hysteresis voltage of\napproximately 17% of V DD. The CMOS inputs can be used\nwith relatively slow edges (approaching DC) if gooddecoupling and bypass techniques are incorporated in the\nsystem design to prevent noise from violating the input\nvoltage hysteresis window. This allows setting precisetiming intervals by fitting an R −C circuit between the\ncontrolling signal and the IN pin of the driver. The slowrising edge at the IN pin of the driver introduces a delaybetween the controlling signal and the OUT pin of the driver.\nStatic Supply Current\nIn the I DD (static) typical performance characteristics\n(Figure 11 − Figure 13 and Figure 18 − Figure 20 ), the curve\nis produced with all inputs/enables floating (OUT is low)and indicates the lowest static I\nDD current for the tested\nconfiguration. For other states, additional current flows\nthrough the 100 k /C0087 resistors on the inputs and outputs\nshown in the block diagram of each part (see Figure 4 −\nFigure 6 ). In these cases, the actual static I DD current is the\nvalue obtained from the curves plus this additional current.\nFAN3223/FAN3224/FAN3225\nwww. onsemi.com\n16MillerDrive Gate Drive Technology\nFAN322x gate drivers incorporate the MillerDrive\narchitecture shown in Figure 47. For the output stage, acombination of bipolar and MOS devices provide largecurrents over a wide range of supply voltage andtemperature variations. The bipolar devices carry the bulk of\nthe current as OUT swings between 1/3 to 2/3 V\nDD and the\nMOS devices pull the output to the HIGH or LOW rail.\nThe purpose of the MillerDrive architecture is to speed up\nswitching by providing high current during the Millerplateau region when the gate −drain capacitance of the\nMOSFET is being charged or discharged as part of theturn−on / turn−off process.\nFor applications that have zero voltage switching during\nthe MOSFET turn −on or turn −off interval, the driver\nsupplies high peak current for fast switching even though the\nMiller plateau is not present. This situation often occurs insynchronous rectifier applications because the body diode is\ngenerally conducting before the MOSFET is switched ON.\nThe output pin slew rate is determined by V\nDD voltage and\nthe load on the output. It is not user adjustable, but a seriesresistor can be added if a slower rise or fall time at the\nMOSFET gate is needed.\nInput\nstage\nFigure 47. MillerDrive Output ArchitectureVDD\nVOUT\nUnder−Voltage Lockout\nThe FAN322x startup logic is optimized to drive\nground -referenced N −channel MOSFETs with an\nunder−voltage lockout (UVLO) function to ensure that the\nIC starts up in an orderly fashion. When V DD is rising, yet\nbelow the UVLO level, this circuit holds the output LOW,regardless of the status of the input pins. After the part isactive, the supply voltage must drop 0.2 V before the partshuts down. This hysteresis helps prevent chatter when low\nV\nDD supply voltages have noise from the power switching.\nThis configuration is not suitable for driving high −side\nP−channel MOSFETs because the low output voltage of the\ndriver would turn the P −channel MOSFET ON with V DD\nbelow the UVLO level .VDD Bypass Capacitor Guidelines\nTo enable this IC to turn a device ON quickly, a local\nhigh-frequency bypass capacitor , CBYP, with low ESR and\nESL should be connected between the VDD and GND pinswith minimal trace length. This capacitor is in addition to the\nbulk electrolytic capacitance of 10 /C0109F to 47 /C0109F commonly\nfound on the driver and controller bias circuits.\nA typical criterion for choosing the value of C\nBYP is to\nkeep the ripple voltage on the V DD supply to ≤5%. This is\noften achieved with a value ≥20 times the equivalent load\ncapacitance C EQV, defined here as Q GATE /VDD. Ceramic\ncapacitors of 0.1 /C0109F to 1 /C0109F or larger are common choices,\nas are dielectrics , such as X5R and X7R with good\ntemperature characteristics and high pulse current\ncapability.\nIf circuit noise affects normal operation , the value of C BYP\nmay be increased to 50 −100 times the C EQV, or C BYP may\nbe split into two capacitors. One should be a larger value ,\nbased on equivalent load capacitance, and the other a smaller\nvalue , such as 1 −10 nF mounted closest to the VDD and\nGND pins to carry the higher frequency components of thecurrent pulses. The bypass capacitor must provide the pulsed\ncurrent from both of the driver channels and , if the drivers\nare switching simultaneously , the combined peak current\nsourced from the C\nBYP would be twice as large as when a\nsingle channel is switching.\nLayout and Connection Guidelines\nThe FAN3223 −25 family of gate drivers incorporates\nfast-reacting input circuits, short propagation delays, and\npowerful output stages capable of delivering current peaksover 4 A to facilitate voltage transition times from under10 ns to over 150 ns. The following layout and connectionguidelines are strongly recommended:\n•Keep high −current output and power ground paths\nseparate logic and enable input signals and signal\nground paths. This is especially critical when dealing\nwith TTL −level logic thresholds at driver inputs and\nenable pins\n•Keep the driver as close to the load as possible to\nminimize the length of high -current traces. This reduces\nthe series inductance to improve high -speed switching ,\nwhile reducing the loop area that can radiate EMI to the\ndriver inputs and surrounding circuitry\n•If the inputs to a channel are not externally connected ,\nthe internal 100 k Ω resistors indicated on block\ndiagrams command a low output. In noisy\nenvironments , it may be necessary to tie inputs of an\nunused channel to VDD or GND using short traces toprevent noise from causing spurious output switching\nFAN3223/FAN3224/FAN3225\nwww. onsemi.com\n17•Many high -speed power circuits can be susceptible to\nnoise injected from their own output or other external\nsources, possibly causing output re −triggering. These\neffects can be obvious if the circuit is tested inbreadboard or non −optimal circuit layouts with long\ninput, enable, or output leads. \nFor best results, make connections to all pins as shortand direct as possible\n•The FAN322x is compatible with many other\nindustry -standard drivers. In single input parts with\nenable pins , there is an internal 100 k /C0087 resistor tied to\nVDD to enable the driver by default; this should beconsidered in the PCB layout\n•The turn−on and turn −off current paths should be\nminimized , as discussed in the following section\n•The Exposed Pad of the SOIC8 −EP package is\nconnected to the substrate of the die. It is recommended\nto connect externally on the PCB the Exposed Pad\ntogether with the Ground\nFigure 48 shows the pulsed gate drive current path when\nthe gate driver is supplying gate charge to turn the MOSFET\nON. The current is supplied from the local bypass capacitor,\nCBYP, and flows through the driver to the MOSFET gate and\nto ground. To reach the high peak currents possible, theresistance and inductance in the path should be minimized.\nThe localized C\nBYP acts to contain the high peak current\npulses within this driver −MOSFET circuit, preventing them\nfrom disturbing the sensitive analog circuitry in the PWMcontroller.\nPWMFAN322x\nFigure 48. Current Path for MOSFET Turn −OnVDD VDS\nCBYP\nFigure 49 shows the current path when the gate driver\nturns the MOSFET OFF. Ideally, the driver shunts thecurrent directly to the source of the MOSFET in a smallcircuit loop. For fast turn −off times, the resistance and\ninductance in this path should be minimized.PWMFAN322x\nFigure 49. Current Path for MOSFET Turn −OffVDD VDS\nCBYP\nTruth Table of Logic Operation\nThe FAN3225 truth table indicates the operational states\nusing the dual −input configuration. In a non −inverting\ndriver configuration, the IN − pin should be a logic LOW\nsignal. If the IN − pin is connected to logic HIGH, a disable\nfunction is realized, and the driver output remains LOW\nregardless of the state of the IN+ pin.\nIN+ IN− OUT\n0 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\n1 1 0\nIn the non −inverting driver configuration in Figure 50, the\nIN− pin is tied to ground and the input signal (PWM) is\napplied to IN+ pin. The IN − pin can be connected to logic\nHIGH to disable the driver and the output remains LOW,regardless of the state of the IN+ pin.\nFigure 50.

The magnitude\nof the OUT pulses rises with V DD until steady −state V DD is\nreached. The non −inverting operation illustrated in\nFigure 52 shows that the output remains LOW until theUVLO threshold is reached, then the output is in −phase with\nthe input.\nFigure 52.

It is\nimportant to determine the driver power dissipation and the\nresulting junction temperature in the application to ensurethat the part is operating within acceptable temperaturelimits.\nThe total power dissipation in a gate driver is the sum of\ntwo components, P\nGATE  and P DYNAMIC :\nPTOTAL/C0043PGATE/C0041PDYNAMIC (eq. 1)\nPGATE  (Gate Driving Loss): The most significant power\nloss results from supplying gate current (charge per unit\ntime) to switch the load MOSFET on and off at the switching\nfrequency. The power dissipation that results from drivinga MOSFET at a specified gate −source voltage, V\nGS, with\ngate char ge, Q G, at switching frequency, f SW, is determined\nby:\nPGATE/C0043QG/C0032VGS/C0032fSW/C0032n (eq. 2)\nwhere n is the number of driver channels in use (1 or 2).\nPDYNAMIC  (Dynamic Pre −Drive / Shoot −through\nCurrent): A power loss resulting from internal currentconsumption under dynamic operating conditions,including pin pull −up / pull−down resistors. The internal\ncurrent consumption (I\nDYNAMIC ) can be estimated using the\ngraphs in Figure 14 and Figure 15 of the TypicalPerformance Characteristics to determine the current\nI\nDYNAMIC  drawn from V DD under actual operating\nconditions:\nPDYNAMIC/C0043IDYNAMIC/C0032VDD/C0032n (eq. 3)\nwhere n is the number of driver ICs in use. Note that n is\nusually be one IC even if the IC has two channels, unless two\nor more .driver ICs are in parallel to drive a large load.\nFAN3223/FAN3224/FAN3225\nwww. onsemi.com\n19Once the power dissipated in the driver is determined, the\ndriver junction rise with respect to circuit board can beevaluated using the following thermal equation, assuming\n/C0089JB was determined for a similar thermal design (heat\nsinking and air flow):\nTJ/C0043PTOTAL/C0032/C0121JB/C0041TB (eq. 4)\nwhere:\nTJ = driver junction temperature;\n/C0089JB = (psi) thermal characterization parameter relating\ntemperature rise to total power dissipation; andT\nB = board temperature in location as defined in the Thermal\nCharacteristics table.\nTo give a numerical example, assume for a 12 V V DD\n(VBIAS) system, the synchronous rectifier switches of\nFigure 56 have a total gate charge of 60 nC at V\nGS = 7 V . Therefore, two devices in parallel would have\n120 nC gate charge. At a switching frequency of 300 kHz,the total power dissipation is:PGATE/C0043120nC/C00327V/C0032300 kHz /C00322/C00430.504 W (eq. 5)\nPDYNAMIC/C00433.0 mA /C003212 V/C00321/C00430.036 W (eq. 6)\nPTOTAL/C00430.540 W (eq. 7)\nThe SOIC −8 has a junction −to−board thermal\ncharacterization parameter of /C0089JB = 42 °C/W. In a system\napplication, the localized temperature around the device is\na function of the layout and construction of the PCB alongwith airflow across the surfaces. To ensure reliableoperation, the maximum junction temperature of the device\nmust be prevented from exceeding the maximum rating of150°C; with 80% derating, T\nJ would be limited to 120 °C.\nRearranging Equation 4 determines the board temperaturerequired to maintain the junction temperature below 120 °C:\nTB, MAX/C0043TJ/C0042PTOTAL/C0032/C0121JB (eq. 8)\nTB, MAX/C0043120°C/C00420.54 W /C003242°C/C0324W/C004397°C (eq. 9)\nFAN3223/FAN3224/FAN3225\nwww. onsemi.com\n20TYPICAL APPLICATION DIAGRAMS\nFigure 54.
