The 1206-8 ChipFET has the samefootprint as the body of the LITTLE FOOT /C0082 TSOP-6, and can\nbe thought of as a leadless TSOP-6 for purposes of visualizing\nboard area, but its thermal performance bears comparisonwith the much larger SO-8.\nThis technical note discusses the dual ChipFET 1206-8\npin-out, package outline, pad patterns, evaluation board\nlayout, and thermal performance.\nPIN-OUT\nFigure  1 shows the pin-out description and Pin 1 identification\nfor the dual-channel 1206-8 ChipFET device. The pin-out issimilar to the TSOP-6 configuration, with two additional drainpins to enhance power dissipation and thus thermalperformance. The legs of the device are very short, again\nhelping to reduce the thermal path to the external heatsink/pcb\nand allowing a larger die to be fitted in the device if necessary.\nFIGURE  1.Dual 1206-8 ChipFET\nS1\nG1\nS2\nD1\nD1\nD2G2\nD2\nFor package dimensions see the 1206-8 ChipFET package\noutline drawing ( http://www.vishay.com/doc?71151 ).\nBASIC PAD PATTERNS\nThe basic pad layout with dimensions is shown in Application\nNote 826, Recommended Minimum Pad Patterns With Outline\nDrawing Access for Vishay Siliconix MOSFET s,\n(http://www.vishay.com/doc?72286 ). This is sufficient for low\npower dissipation MOSFET applications, but powersemiconductor performance requires a greater copper pad\narea, particularly for the drain leads.\nFIGURE  2. Footprint With Copper Spreading80 mil\n43 mil\n10 mil\n26 mil18 mil25 mil\nThe pad pattern with copper spreading shown in Figure  2\nimproves the thermal area of the drain connections (pins 5 and\n6, pins 7 and 8) while remaining within the confines of the basic\nfootprint. The drain copper area is 0.0019 sq. in. or1.22 sq. mm. This will assist the power dissipation path awayfrom the device (through the copper leadframe) and into theboard and exterior chassis (if applicable) for the dual device.The addition of a further copper area and/or the addition of vias\nto other board layers will enhance the performance still further.\nAn example of this method is implemented on the VishaySiliconix Evaluation Board described in the next section(Figure  3).\nTHE VISHAY SILICONIX EVALUATION\nBOARD FOR THE DUAL 1206-8\nThe dual ChipFET 1206-08 evaluation board measures 0.6 in\nby 0.5 in. Its copper pad pattern consists of an increased pad\narea around each of the two drain leads on the top-side—approximately 0.0246 sq. in. or 15.87 sq. mm—and viasadded through to the underside of the board, again with amaximized copper pad area of approximately the board-sizedimensions, split into two for each of the drains. The outer\npackage outline is for the 8-pin DIP, which will allow test\nsockets to be used to assist in testing.\nThe thermal performance of the 1206-8 on this board has been\nmeasured with the results following on the next page. Thetesting included comparison with the minimum recommended\nfootprint on the evaluation board-size pcb and the industrystandard one-inch square FR4 pcb with copper on both sides\nof the board.\nAN812\nVishay Siliconix\nwww.vishay.com\n2Document Number:  71127\n12-Dec-03\nFront of Board Back of Board\nFIGURE  3.vishay.comChipFET /C0114\nTHERMAL PERFORMANCE\nJunction-to-Foot Thermal Resistance (the Package\nPerformance)\nThermal performance for the 1206-8 ChipFET measured as\njunction-to-foot thermal resistance is 30 /C0095C/W typical, 40 /C0095C/W\nmaximum for the dual device. The “foot” is the drain lead of the\ndevice as it connects with the body. This is identical to the dualSO-8 package R\n/C0081jf performance, a feat made possible by\nshortening the leads to the point where they become only a\nsmall part of the total footprint area.\nJunction-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance\n(dependent on pcb size)\nThe typical R /C0081ja for the dual-channel 1206-8 ChipFET is\n90/C0095C/W steady state, identical to the SO-8. Maximum ratings\nare 110 /C0095C/W for both the 1206-8 and the SO-8. Both packages\nhave comparable thermal performance on the 1” square pcbfootprint with the 1206-8 dual package having a quarter of the\nbody area, a significant factor when considering board area.\nTesting\nTo aid comparison further, Figure 4 illustrates ChipFET 1206-8\ndual thermal performance on two different board sizes andthree different pad patterns.The results display the thermalperformance out to steady state and produce a graphic\naccount on how an increased copper pad area for the drain\nconnections can enhance thermal performance. Themeasured steady state values of R\n/C0081ja for the Dual 1206-8\nChipFET are :\n1) Minimum recommended pad pattern (see\nFigure  2) on the evaluation board size of0.5 in x 0.6 in.185/C0095C/W\n2) The evaluation board with the pad pattern\ndescribed on Figure  3.128/C0095C/W\n3) Industry standard 1” square pcb with\nmaximum copper both sides.90/C0095C/WThe results show that a major reduction can be made in the\nthermal resistance by increasing the copper drain area. In this\nexample, a 57 /C0095C/W reduction was achieved without having to\nincrease the size of the board. If increasing board size is anoption, a further 38 /C0095C/W reduction was obtained by\nmaximizing the copper from the drain on the larger 1” square\nPCB.\nTime (Secs)\nFIGURE  4.
