Storage \n2.1 Do not open moisture proof bag before the products are ready to use. \n 2.2 Before opening the package, the LEDs should be kept at 30 ℃ or less and 90%RH or less. \n 2.3 The LEDs should be used within a year. \n 2.4 After opening the package, the LEDs should be kept at 30 ℃ or less and 70%RH or less. \n 2.5 The LEDs should be used within 168 hours (7 days) after opening the package.   \n2.6 If the moisture absorbent material (silica gel) has faded away or the LEDs have exceeded the  \nstorage time, baking treatment should be performed using the following conditions. \nBaking treatment : 60 ±5℃ for 24 hours. \n3. Soldering Condition \n3.1 Pb-free solder temperature profile                              \n \n \n3.2 Reflow soldering should not be done more than two times. 3.3 When soldering, do not put stress on the LEDs during heating. 3.4 After soldering, do not warp the circuit board.    \n \n \n  Everlight Electronics Co., Ltd.           http:\\\\www.ever light.com          Rev 1          Page: 7 of 10 \n  Device No ：DTT-026-269              Prepared date ：03-06-2007        Prepared by ：Posen  Hsu \n \n \nPT26-51B/TR8  \n4.Soldering Iron  \n       Each terminal is to go to the tip of soldering iron temperature less than 280 ℃ for 3 \nseconds within once in less than the soldering iron capacity 25W. Leave two seconds and more \nintervals, and do soldering of each terminal. Be car eful because the damage of the product is often \nstarted at the time of the hand solder. 5.Repairing         Repair should not be done after the LEDs have been soldered. When repairing is unavoidable, a double-head soldering iron should be used (as below figure).
