The \n512 Kbytes of data are divided into eight sectors of 64 Kbytes each for flexible erase capability. The 8 bits of data appear on DQ0–DQ7. The Am29F040B is offered in 32-pin PLCC, TSOP , and PDIP packages. This device is designed to be programmed in-system with the stan\n-\ndard system 5.0 volt VCC supply. A 12.0 volt VPP is not \nrequired for write or erase operations. The device can also be programmed in standard EPROM programmers.\nThis device is manufactured using AMD’s 0.32 µm pro -\ncess technology, and offers all the features and benefits of the Am29F040, which was manufactured using 0.5 µm process technology. In addtion, the Am29F040B has a second toggle bit, DQ2, and also of\n-\nfers the ability to program in the Erase Suspend mode.\nThe standard Am29F040B offers access times of 55, \n70, 90, and 120 ns, allowing high-speed microproces -\nsors to operate without wait states. To eliminate bus contention the device has separate chip enable (CE#), write enable (WE#) and output enable (OE#) controls.\nThe device requires only a single 5.0 volt power sup -\nply for both read and write functions. Internally \ngenerated and regulated voltages are provided for the program and erase operations. \nThe device is entirely command set compatible with the JEDEC single-power-supply Flash standard . Com\n-\nmands are written to the command register using \nstandard microprocessor write timings. Register con -\ntents serve as input to an internal state-machine that controls the erase and programming circuitry. Write cy\n-\ncles also internally latch addresses and data needed for the programming and erase operations. Reading data out of the device is similar to reading from other Flash or EPROM devices.\nDevice programming occurs by executing the program command sequence. This initiates the Embedded \nProgram  algorithm—an internal algorithm that auto\n-matically times the program pulse widths and verifies \nproper cell margin.\nDevice erasure occurs by executing the erase com -\nmand sequence. This initiates the Embedded Erase\nalgorithm—an internal algorithm that automatically preprograms the array (if it is not already programmed) before executing the erase operation. During erase, the device automatically times the erase pulse widths and verifies proper cell margin. \nThe host system can detect whether a program or erase operation is complete by reading the DQ7 (Data# Polling) and DQ6 (toggle) status bits .\n  After a program \nor erase cycle has been completed, the device is ready to read array data or accept another command. \nThe sector erase architecture  allows memory sectors \nto be erased and reprogrammed without affecting the data contents of other sectors. The device is fully erased when shipped from the factory.\nHardware data protection  measures include a low \nVCC detector that automatically inhibits write opera -\ntions during power transitions. The hardware sector \nprotection  feature disables both program and erase \noperations in any combination of the sectors of mem -\nory. This can be achieved via programming equipment.\nThe Erase Suspend  feature enables the user to put \nerase on hold for any period of time to read data from, or program data to, any sector that is not selected for erasure. True background erase can thus be achieved.\nThe system can place the device into the standby mode . \nPower consumption is greatly reduced in this mode.\nAMD’s Flash technology combines years of Flash memory manufacturing experience to produce the highest levels of quality, reliability and cost effective\n-\nness. The device electrically erases all bits within a sector simultaneously via Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The data is programmed using hot electron injection.\nNovember 1, 2006  21445E5   Am29F040B 3DATA SHEET\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nProduct Selector Guide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4\nBlock Diagram . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  4\nConnection Diagrams . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  5\nPin Configuration. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  5\nLogic Symbol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  5\nOrdering Information . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6\nDevice Bus Operations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  7\nTable 1.

The command register it\n-\nself does not occupy any addressable memory location. The register is composed of latches that store the commands, along with the address and data infor\n-mation needed to execute the command. The contents of the register serve as inputs to the internal state ma\n-\nchine. The state machine outputs dictate the function of the device. The appropriate device bus operations table lists the inputs and control levels required, and the resulting output. The following subsections describe each of these operations in further detail.\nTable 1.  Am29F040B Device Bus Operations\nLegend:\nL = Logic Low = VIL, H = Logic High = VIH, VID = 12.0 ± 0.5 V, X = Don’t Care, DIN = Data In, DOUT = Data Out, AIN = Address In\nNote: See the “Sector Protection/Unprotection” section. for more information.\nRequirements for Reading Array Data\nTo read array data from the outputs, the system must \ndrive the CE# and OE# pins to VIL. CE# is the power \ncontrol and selects the device. OE# is the output con -\ntrol and gates array data to the output pins. WE# should remain at V\nIH.\nThe internal state machine is set for reading array data upon device power-up, or after a hardware reset. This ensures that no spurious alteration of the memory con\n-\ntent occurs during the power transition. No command is necessary in this mode to obtain array data. Standard microprocessor read cycles that  assert valid addresses \non the device address inputs produce valid data on the device data outputs. The device remains enabled for \nread access until the command register contents are \naltered.\nSee “Reading Array Data”  for more information. Refer \nto the AC Read Operations table for timing specifica -\ntions and to the Read Operations Timings diagram for \nthe timing waveforms. ICC1 in the DC Characteristics \ntable represents the active current specification for reading array data.\nWriting Commands/Command Sequences\nTo write a command or command sequence (which in -\ncludes programming data to the device and erasing sectors of memory), the system must drive WE# and CE# to V\nIL, and OE# to VIH.\nAn erase operation can erase one sector, multiple sec -\ntors, or the entire device. The Sector Address Tables indicate the address space that each sector occupies. \nA “sector address” consists of  the address bits required \nto uniquely select a sector. See the “Command Defini -\ntions”  section for details on erasing a sector or the \nentire chip, or suspending/resuming the erase operation.\nAfter the system writes the autoselect command se -\nquence, the device enters the autoselect mode. The system can then read autose lect codes from the inter\n-\nnal register (which is separate from the memory array) \non DQ7–DQ0. Standard read cycle timings apply in this mode. Refer to the \n“Autoselect Mode”  and “Autoselect \nCommand Sequence”  sections for more information.\nICC2 in the DC Characteristics table represents the ac -\ntive current specification for the write mode. The “AC \nCharacteristics” section contains timing specification \ntables and timing diagrams for write operations.\nProgram and Erase Operation Status\nDuring an erase or program operation, the system may check the status of the operation by reading the status bits on DQ7–DQ0. Standard read cycle timings and I\nCC\nread specifications  apply. Refer to “Write Operation \nStatus”  for more information, and to each AC Charac -\nteristics section for timing diagrams.\nStandby Mode\nWhen the system is not reading or writing to the device, \nit can place the device in the standby mode. In this mode, current consumption is greatly reduced, and the Operation CE# OE# WE# A0–A20 DQ0–DQ7\nRead L L H AIN DOUT\nWrite L H L AIN DIN\nCMOS Standby VCC ± 0.5 V X X X High-Z\nTTL Standby H X X X High-Z\nOutput Disable L H H X High-Z\n8 Am29F040B 21445E5   November 1, 2006DATA SHEET\noutputs are placed in the high impedance state, inde -\npendent of the OE# input. \nThe device enters the CMOS standby mode when the \nCE# pin is held at VCC ± 0.5 V. (Note that this is a more \nrestricted voltage range than VIH.) The device enters \nthe TTL standby mode when CE# is held at VIH. The \ndevice requires the standard access time (tCE) before it \nis ready to read data.If the device is deselected during erasure or program -\nming, the device draws active current until the operation is completed.\nICC3 in the DC Characteristics tables represents the \nstandby current specification. \nOutput Disable Mode\nWhen the OE# input is at VIH, output from the device is \ndisabled. The output pins are placed in the high imped -\nance state.\nTable 2.

This mode is primarily intended for programming equipment to automatically match a device to be programmed with its corresponding programming algorithm. However, the autoselect codes can also be accessed in-system through the command register.\nWhen using programming equipment, the autoselect mode requires V\nID (11.5 V to 12.5 V) on address pin \nA9. Address pins A6 , A1, and A0 must be as shown in \nAutoselect Codes (High Voltage Method) table. In addi -\ntion, when verifying sector protection, the sector address must appear on the appropriate highest order \naddress bits. Refer to the corresponding Sector Ad -\ndress Tables. The Command Definitions table shows the remaining address bits that are don’t care. When all necessary bits have been set as required, the program\n-\nming equipment may then read the corresponding identifier code on DQ7–DQ0.\nTo access the autoselect codes in-system, the host system can issue the autoselect command via the command register, as shown in the Command Defini\n-\ntions table. This method does not require VID. See \n“Command Definitions”  for details on using the autose -\nlect mode.\nTable 3.  Am29F040B Autoselect Codes (High Voltage Method)\nSector Protection/Unprotection\nThe hardware sector protection feature disables both program and erase operations in any sector. The hard\n-\nware sector unprotection feature re-enables both program and erase operations in previously protected sectors. \nSector protection/unprotection must be implemented using programming equipment. The procedure re\n-\nquires a high voltage (VID) on address pin A9 and the \ncontrol pins. Details on this method are provided in a supplement, publication number 19957. Contact an AMD representative to obtain a copy of the appropriate document. \nThe device is shipped with all sectors unprotected. AMD offers the option of programming and protecting sectors at its factory prio r to shipping the device \nthrough AMD’s ExpressFlash™ Service. Contact an AMD representative for details.\nIt is possible to determine whether a sector is protected or unprotected. See \n“Autoselect Mode”  for details.\nHardware Data Protection\nThe command sequence requirement of unlock cycles for programming or erasing provides data protection against inadvertent writes (refer to the Command Defi\n-\nnitions table). In addition, the following hardware data protection measures prevent accidental erasure or pro\n-gramming, which might otherwise be caused by spurious system level signals during V\nCC power-up and \npower-down transitions, or from system noise.\nLow VCC Write Inhibit\nWhen VCC is less than VLKO, the device does not ac -\ncept any write cycles. This protects data during VCC \npower-up and power-down. The command register and all internal program/erase circuits are disabled, and the device resets. Subsequent writes are ignored until V\nCC\nis greater than VLKO. The system must provide the \nproper signals to the control pins to prevent uninten -\ntional writes when VCC is greater than VLKO.\nWrite Pulse “Glitch” Protection\nNoise pulses of less than 5 ns (typical) on OE#, CE# or WE# do not initiate a write cycle.\nLogical Inhibit\nWrite cycles are inhibited by holding any one of OE# = V\nIL, CE# = VIH or WE# = VIH. To initiate a write cycle, \nCE# and WE# must be a logical zero while OE# is a logical one.\nPower-Up Write Inhibit\nIf WE# = CE# = VIL and OE# = VIH during power up, the \ndevice does not accept commands on the rising edge of WE#. The internal state machine is automatically reset to reading array data on power-up.Description A18–A16 A15–A10 A9 A8–A7 A6 A5–A2 A1 A0Identifier Code on \nDQ7-DQ0\nManufacturer ID : AMD X X VID X VIL X VIL VIL 01h\nDevice ID: Am29F040B X X VID X VIL X VIL VIH A4h\nSector Protection \nVerificationSector \nAddressX VID X VIL X VIH VIL01h (protected)\n00h (unprotected)\n10 Am29F040B 21445E5   November 1, 2006DATA SHEET\nCOMMAND DEFINITIONS\nWriting specific address and data commands or se -\nquences into the command re gister initiates device \noperations. The Command Definitions table defines the valid register command sequences. Writing incorrect\naddress and data values  or writing them in the im\n-\nproper sequence  resets the device to reading array \ndata. \nAll addresses are latched on the falling edge of WE# or CE#, whichever happens later. All data is latched on the rising edge of WE# or CE#, whichever happens first. Refer to the appropriate timing diagrams in the \n“AC Characteristics”  section.\nReading Array Data\nThe device is automatically  set to reading array data \nafter device power-up. No commands are required to retrieve data. The device is also ready to read array data after completing an Embedded Program or Em\n-\nbedded Erase algorithm.\nAfter the device accepts an Erase Suspend command, the device enters the Erase Suspend mode. The sys\n-\ntem can read array data using the standard read timings, except that if it reads at an address within erase-suspended sectors, the device outputs status data. After completing a programming operation in the Erase Suspend mode, the system may once again read array data with the same exception. See \n“Erase \nSuspend/Erase Resume Commands”  for more infor -\nmation on this mode.\nThe system must  issue the reset command to re-en -\nable the device for reading array data if DQ5 goes high, \nor while in the autoselect mode. See the “Reset Com -\nmand”  section, next.\nSee also “Requirements for Reading Array Data”  in the \n“Device Bus Operations”  section for more information. \nThe Read Operations table provides the read parame -\nters, and Read Operation Timings diagram shows the \ntiming diagram.\nReset Command\nWriting the reset command to the device resets the de -\nvice to reading array data. Address bits are don’t care for this command. \nThe reset command may be written between the se -\nquence cycles in an erase command sequence before erasing begins. This resets the device to reading array data. Once erasure begins, however, the device ig\n-\nnores reset commands until the operation is complete.\nThe reset command may be written between the se -\nquence cycles in a program command sequence before programming begins. This resets the device to reading array data (also applies to programming in Erase Suspend mode). Once programming begins, however, the device ignores reset commands until the \noperation is complete.\nThe reset command may be written between the se -\nquence cycles in an autoselect command sequence. Once in the autoselect mode, the reset command must\nbe written to return to reading array data (also applies to autoselect during Erase Suspend).\nIf DQ5 goes high during a program or erase operation, writing the reset command returns the device to read\n-\ning array data (also applies during Erase Suspend).\nAutoselect Command Sequence\nThe autoselect command sequence allows the host system to access the manufa cturer and devices codes, \nand determine whether or not a sector is protected. The Command Definitions table shows the address and data requirements. This method is an alternative to that shown in the Autoselect Codes (High Voltage Method) table, which is intended for PROM program\n-\nmers and requires VID on address bit A9.\nThe autoselect command seque nce is initiated by writ -\ning two unlock cycles, followed by the autoselect \ncommand. The device then enters the autoselect mode, and the system may read at any address any number of times, without initiating another command sequence. \nA read cycle at address XX00h or retrieves the manu -\nfacturer code. A read cycle at address XX01h returns the device code. A read cycle containing a sector ad\n-\ndress (SA) and the address 02h in returns 01h if that sector is protected, or 00h if it is unprotected. Refer to the Sector Address tables for valid sector addresses.\nThe system must write the reset command to exit the autoselect mode and return to reading array data.\nByte Program Command Sequence\nProgramming is a four-bus-cycle operation. The pro -\ngram command sequence is initiated by writing two unlock write cycles, followed by the program set-up command. The program address and data are written next, which in turn initiate the Embedded Program al\n-\ngorithm. The system is not required to provide further \ncontrols or timings. The device automatically provides internally generated program pulses and verify the pro\n-\ngrammed cell margin. The Command Definitions take shows the address and data requirements for the byte program command sequence.\nWhen the Embedded Program algorithm is complete, the device then returns to reading array data and ad\n-\ndresses are no longer latched. The system can determine the status of the program operation by using DQ7 or DQ6. See “Write Operation Status” for informa\n-\ntion on these status bits. \nNovember 1, 2006  21445E5   Am29F040B 11DATA SHEET\nAny commands written to the device during the Em -\nbedded Program Algorithm are ignored. \nProgramming is allowed in any sequence and across \nsector boundaries. A bit cannot be programmed \nfrom a “0” back to a “1”. Attempting to do so may halt \nthe operation and set DQ5 to “1”, or cause the Data# Polling algorithm to indicate the operation was suc\n-\ncessful. However, a succeeding read shows that the data is still “0”. Only erase operations can convert a “0” \nto a “1”.\nNote: See the appropriate Command Definitions table for \nprogram command sequence.\n Figure 1.  Program Operation\nChip Erase Command Sequence\nChip erase is a six-bus-cycle operation. The chip erase \ncommand sequence is initiated by writing two unlock cycles, followed by a set-up command. Two additional unlock write cycles are then followed by the chip erase command, which in turn invokes the Embedded Erase algorithm. The device does not require the system to \npreprogram prior to erase. The Embedded Erase algo\n-\nrithm automatically preprograms and verifies the entire memory for an all zero data pattern prior to electrical \nerase. The system is not required to provide any con -\ntrols or timings during these operations. The Command Definitions table shows the address and data require\n-\nments for the chip erase command sequence.\nAny commands written to the chip during the Embed -\nded Erase algorithm are ignored. \nThe system can determine the status of the erase op -\neration by using DQ7, DQ6, or DQ2. See “Write \nOperation Status”  for information on these status bits.\nWhen the Embedded Erase algorithm is complete, the device returns to reading array data and addresses are no longer latched. \nFigure  2 illustrates the algorithm for the erase opera -\ntion. See the Erase and Program Operations tables in \n“AC Characteristics”  for parameters, and to the Chip/\nSector Erase Operation Timings for timing waveforms.\nSector Erase Command Sequence\nSector erase is a six bus cycle operation. The sector \nerase command sequence is initiated by writing two un -\nlock cycles, followed by a set-up command. Two additional unlock write cycles are then followed by the address of the sector to be erased, and the sector erase command. The Command Definitions table shows the address and data requirements for the sec\n-\ntor erase command sequence.\nThe device does not require the system to preprogram \nthe memory prior to erase. The Embedded Erase algo -\nrithm automatically programs and verifies the sector for an all zero data pattern prior to electrical erase. The system is not required to provide any controls or tim\n-\nings during these operations. \nAfter the command sequence is written, a sector erase time-out of 50 µs begins. During the time-out period, additional sector addresses and sector erase com\n-\nmands may be written. Loading the sector erase buffer may be done in any sequence, and the number of sec\n-\ntors may be from one sector to all sectors. The time between these additional cycles must be less than 50 µs, otherwise the last address and command might not be accepted, and erasure may begin. It is recom\n-\nmended that processor interrupts be disabled during this time to ensure all commands are accepted. The in\n-\nterrupts can be re-enabled after the last Sector Erase command is written. If the time between additional sec\n-\ntor erase commands can be assumed to be less than 50 µs, the system need not monitor DQ3. Any com\n-\nmand other than Sector Erase or Erase Suspend \nduring the time-out period resets the device to reading array data.  The system must rewrite the com\n-\nmand sequence and any additional sector addresses \nand commands.\nThe system can monitor DQ3 to determine if the sector erase timer has timed out. (See the \n“DQ3: Sector Erase START\nWrite Program\nCommand Sequence\nData Poll \nfrom System\nVerify Data?No\nYes\nLast Address?No\nYes\nProgramming\n CompletedIncrement AddressEmbedded\nProgram\nalgorithm\n in progress\n12 Am29F040B 21445E5   November 1, 2006DATA SHEET\nTimer”  section.) The time-out begins from the rising \nedge of the final WE# pulse in the command sequence.\nOnce the sector erase operation has begun, only the \nErase Suspend command is valid. All other commands are ignored. \nWhen the Embedded Erase algorithm is complete, the device returns to reading array data and addresses are no longer latched. The system can determine the sta\n-\ntus of the erase operation by using DQ7, DQ6, or DQ2. Refer to \n“Write Operation Status”  for information on \nthese status bits.\nFigure  2 illustrates the algorithm for the erase opera -\ntion. Refer to the Erase/Program Operations tables in \nthe “AC Characteristics”  section for parameters, and to \nthe Sector Erase Operations Timing diagram for timing waveforms.\nErase Suspend/Erase Resume Commands\nThe Erase Suspend command allows the system to in -\nterrupt a sector erase operation and then read data \nfrom, or program data to, any sector not selected for erasure. This command is valid only during the sector erase operation, including the 50 µs time-out period during the sector erase command sequence. The Erase Suspend command is ignored if written during the chip erase operation or Embedded Program algo\n-\nrithm. Writing the Erase Suspend command during the Sector Erase time-out immediately terminates the time-out period and suspends the erase operation. Ad\n-\ndresses are “don’t-cares” when writing the Erase Suspend command.\nWhen the Erase Suspend command is written during a sector erase operation, the device requires a maximum of 20 µs to suspend the erase operation. However, when the Erase Suspend command is written during the sector erase time-out, the device immediately ter\n-\nminates the time-out period and suspends the erase operation.\nAfter the erase operation has been suspended, the system can read array data from or program data to \nany sector not selected for er asure. (The device “erase \nsuspends” all sectors selected for erasure.) Normal read and write timings and command definitions apply. Reading at any address within erase-suspended sec\n-\ntors produces status data on DQ7–DQ0. The system can use DQ7, or DQ6 and DQ2 together, to determine if a sector is actively erasing or is erase-suspended. See \n“Write Operation Status”  for information on these \nstatus bits.\nAfter an erase-suspended program operation is com -\nplete, the system can once again read array data within \nnon-suspended sectors. The system can determine the status of the program operation using the DQ7 or \nDQ6 status bits, just as in the standard program oper -\nation. See “Write Operation Status”  for more \ninformation.\nThe system may also write the autoselect command sequence when the device is in the Erase Suspend mode. The device allows reading autoselect codes even at addresses within erasing sectors, since the codes are not stored in the memory array. When the device exits the autoselect mode, the device reverts to the Erase Suspend mode, and is ready for another valid operation. See \n“Autoselect Command Sequence”\nfor more information.\nThe system must write the Erase Resume command (address bits are “don’t care”) to exit the erase suspend mode and continue the sector erase operation. Further writes of the Resume command are ignored. Another Erase Suspend command can be written after the de\n-\nvice has resumed erasing.\nNotes:\n1. See the appropriate Command Definitions table for erase \ncommand sequence.\n2. See “DQ3: Sector Erase Timer”  for more information.\n Figure 2.

Table 5 and the following subsections describe \nthe functions of these bits. DQ7 and DQ6 each offer a \nmethod for determining whether a program or erase operation is complete or in progress. These three bits are discussed first.\nDQ7: Data# Polling\nThe Data# Polling bit, DQ7, indicates to the host sys -\ntem whether an Embedded Algorithm is in progress or completed, or whether the device is in Erase Suspend. Data# Polling is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# pulse in the program or erase command sequence.\nDuring the Embedded Program algorithm, the device outputs on DQ7 the complement of the datum pro\n-\ngrammed to DQ7. This DQ7 status also applies to programming during Erase Suspend. When the Em\n-\nbedded Program algorithm is complete, the device outputs the datum programmed to DQ7. The system must provide the program address to read valid status information on DQ7. If a program address falls within a protected sector, Data# Polling on DQ7 is active for ap\n-\nproximately 2 µs, then the device returns to reading array data.\nDuring the Embedded Erase algorithm, Data# Polling produces a “0” on DQ7. When the Embedded Erase al\n-\ngorithm is complete, or if the device enters the Erase Suspend mode, Data# Polling produces a “1” on DQ7. \nThis is analogous to the complement/true datum output described for the Embedded Program algorithm: the erase function changes all the bits in a sector to “1”; prior to this, the device outputs the “complement,” or “0.” The system must provide an address within any of the sectors selected for erasure to read valid status in\n-\nformation on DQ7.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if all sec -\ntors selected for erasing are protected, Data# Polling on DQ7 is active for approximately 100 µs, then the de\n-\nvice returns to reading arra y data. If not all selected \nsectors are protected, the Embedded Erase algorithm erases the unprotected sectors, and ignores the se\n-\nlected sectors that are protected.\nWhen the system detects DQ7 has changed from the complement to true data, it can read valid data at DQ7–DQ0 on the following  read cycles. This is be\n-\ncause DQ7 may change asynchronously with \nDQ0–DQ6 while Output Enable  (OE#) is asserted low. \nThe Data# Polling Timings (During Embedded Algo -rithms) figure in the “AC Characteristics”  section \nillustrates this.\nTable 5 shows the outputs for Data# Polling on DQ7. \nFigure  3 shows the Data# Polling algorithm.\nDQ7 = Data?Yes\nNo\nNoDQ5 = 1?No\nYes\nYes\nFAIL PASSRead DQ7–DQ0\nAddr = VA\nRead DQ7–DQ0\nAddr = VA\nDQ7 = Data?START\nNotes:\n1. VA = Valid address for programming. During a sector \nerase operation, a valid address is an address within any sector selected for erasure. During chip erase, a valid \naddress is any non-protected sector address.\n2. DQ7 should be rechecked even if DQ5 = “1” because \nDQ7 may change simultaneously with DQ5.\n Figure 3.  Data# Polling Algorithm\nNovember 1, 2006  21445E5   Am29F040B 15DATA SHEET\nDQ6: Toggle Bit I\nToggle Bit I on DQ6 indicates whether an Embedded \nProgram or Erase algorithm is in progress or complete, or whether the device has entered the Erase Suspend mode. Toggle Bit I may be read at any address, and is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# pulse in the command sequence (prior to the program or erase op\n-\neration), and during the sector erase time-out.\nDuring an Embedded Program or Erase algorithm op -\neration, successive read cycles to any address cause DQ6 to toggle. (The system may use either OE# or CE# to control the read cycles .) When the operation is \ncomplete, DQ6 stops toggling.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if all sec -\ntors selected for erasing are protected, DQ6 toggles for approximately 100 µs, then returns to reading array data. If not all selected sectors are protected, the Em\n-\nbedded Erase algorithm erases the unprotected sectors, and ignores the selected sectors that are protected. \nThe system can use DQ6 and DQ2 together to deter -\nmine whether a sector is acti vely erasing or is erase-\nsuspended. When the device is actively erasing (that is, the Embedded Erase algorithm is in progress), DQ6 toggles. When the device enters the Erase Suspend mode, DQ6 stops toggling. However, the system must also use DQ2 to determine which sectors are erasing or erase-suspended. Alternatively, the system can use DQ7 (see the subsection on \n“DQ7: Data# Polling” ).\nIf a program address falls within a protected sector, DQ6 toggles for approximately 2 µs after the program command sequence is written, then returns to reading array data.\nDQ6 also toggles during the erase-suspend-program mode, and stops toggling once the Embedded Pro\n-\ngram algorithm is complete.\nThe Write Operation Status table shows the outputs for Toggle Bit I on DQ6. Refer to \nFigure  4 for the toggle bit \nalgorithm, and to the Toggle Bit Timings figure in the \n“AC Characteristics”  section for the timing diagram. \nThe DQ2 vs. DQ6 figure shows the differences be -\ntween DQ2 and DQ6 in graphical form. See also the \nsubsection on “DQ2: Toggle Bit II” .\nDQ2: Toggle Bit II\nThe “Toggle Bit II” on DQ2, when used with DQ6, indi -\ncates whether a particular sector is actively erasing (that is, the Embedded Erase algorithm is in progress), or whether that sector is erase-suspended. Toggle Bit II is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# pulse in the command sequence. \nDQ2 toggles when the system reads at addresses within those sectors that have been selected for era\n-sure. (The system may use either OE# or CE# to control the read cycles.) But DQ2 cannot distinguish whether the sector is actively erasing or is erase-sus\n-\npended. DQ6, by comparison, indicates whether the device is actively erasing, or is in Erase Suspend, but cannot distinguish which sectors are selected for era\n-\nsure. Thus, both status bits are required for sector and mode information. Refer to \nTable 5 to compare outputs \nfor DQ2 and DQ6. \nFigure  4 shows the toggle bit algorithm in flowchart \nform, and the section “DQ2: Toggle Bit II”  explains the \nalgorithm. See also the “DQ6: Toggle Bit I”  subsection. \nRefer to the Toggle Bit Timings figure for the toggle bit \ntiming diagram. The DQ2 vs. DQ6 figure shows the dif -\nferences between DQ2 and DQ6 in graphical form. \nReading Toggle Bits DQ6/DQ2\nRefer to Figure  4 for the following discussion. When -\never the system initially be gins reading toggle bit \nstatus, it must read DQ7–DQ0 at least twice in a row to determine whether a toggle bit is toggling. Typically, a system would note and store the value of the toggle bit after the first read. After the second read, the system would compare the new value of the toggle bit with the first. If the toggle bit is not toggling, the device has com\n-\npleted the program or erase operation. The system can read array data on DQ7–DQ0 on the following read cycle.\nHowever, if after the initia l two read cycles, the system \ndetermines that the toggle bit is still toggling, the sys -\ntem also should note whether the value of DQ5 is high \n(see the section on DQ5). If it is, the system should then determine again whether the toggle bit is toggling, since the toggle bit may have stopped toggling just as DQ5 went high. If the toggle bit is no longer toggling, the device has successfully completed the program or erase operation. If it is still toggling, the device did not \ncomplete the operation successfully, and the system must write the reset command to return to reading array data. \nThe remaining scenario is th at the system initially de -\ntermines that the toggle bit is toggling and DQ5 has not \ngone high. The system may continue to monitor the toggle bit and DQ5 through successive read cycles, de\n-\ntermining the status as described in the previous \nparagraph. Alternatively, it may choose to perform other system tasks. In this case, the system must start at the beginning of the algorithm when it returns to de\n-\ntermine the status of the operation (top of Figure  4).\nDQ5: Exceeded Ti ming Limits\nDQ5 indicates whether the program or erase time has \nexceeded a specified intern al pulse count limit. Under \nthese conditions DQ5 produces a “1.” This is a failure condition that indicates the program or erase cycle was not successfully completed. \n16 Am29F040B 21445E5   November 1, 2006DATA SHEET\nThe DQ5 failure condition may appear if the system \ntries to program a “1” to a location that is previously pro -\ngrammed to “0.” Only an erase operation can change \na “0” back to a “1.”  Under this condition, the device \nhalts the operation, and when the operation has ex -\nceeded the timing limits, DQ5 produces a “1.”\nUnder both these conditions, the system must issue the reset command to return the device to reading array data.\nDQ3: Sector Erase Timer\nAfter writing a sector erase command sequence, the system may read DQ3 to determine whether or not an erase operation has begun. (The sector erase timer does not apply to the chip erase command.) If addi\n-\ntional sectors are selected for erasure, the entire time-out also applies after each additional sector erase com\n-\nmand. When the time-out is complete, DQ3 switches from “0” to “1.” The system  may ignore DQ3 if the sys\n-\ntem can guarantee that the time between additional \nsector erase commands is always less than 50 µs. See also the \n“Sector Erase Command Sequence”  section.\nAfter the sector erase command sequence is written, the system should read the status on DQ7 (Data# Poll\n-\ning) or DQ6 (Toggle Bit I) to ensure the device has accepted the command sequence, and then read DQ3. If DQ3 is “1”, the internally controlled erase cycle has begun; all further commands (other than Erase Sus\n-\npend) are ignored until the erase operation is complete. If DQ3 is “0”, the device accepts additional sector erase commands. To ensure the command has been ac\n-\ncepted, the system software should check the status of DQ3 prior to and following each subsequent sector erase command. If DQ3 is high on the second status check, the last command might not have been ac\n-\ncepted.

Typical program and erase times assume the following conditions: 25 °C, 5.0 V VCC, 1,000,000 cycles. Additionally, \nprogramming typicals assume checkerboard pattern.\n2. Under worst case conditions of 90°C, VCC = 4.5 V (4.75 V for -55), 1,000,000 cycles.\n3. The typical chip programming time is considerably less than the maximum chip programming time listed, since most bytes \nprogram faster than the maximum byte prog ram time listed. If the maximum byte prog ram time given is exceeded, only then \ndoes the device set DQ5 = 1. See the section on DQ5 for further information.\n4. In the pre-programming step of the Embedded Erase algorithm, all bytes are programmed to 00h before erasure.\n5. System-level overhead is the time required to execut e the four-bus-cycle command sequence for programming. See Table 4 \nfor further information on command definitions.\n6.
