During power-up, when the supply voltages \nare changing, V\nOUT is clamped to 0 V via a low impedance path. \nThe AD5570 DAC comes complete with a set of reference \nbuffers. The reference buffers allow a single, positive reference to be used. The voltage on REFIN is gained up and inverted internally to give the positive and negative reference for the \nDAC core. Having the reference buffers on-chip eliminates the \nneed for external components such as inverters, precision amplifiers, and resistors, thereby reducing the overall solution \nsize and cost. \nThe AD5570 uses a versatile 3-wire interface that is compatible \nwith SPI®, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP® interface standards. Data is presented to the part as a 16-bit serial word. Serial data \nis available on the SDO pin for daisy-chaining purposes. Data readback allows the user to read the contents of the DAC \nregister via the SDO pin. \nFeatures on the AD5570 include LDAC\n which is used to update \nthe output of the DAC. The device also has a power-down pin \n(PD), allowing the DAC to be put into a low power state, and a \nCLR  pin that allows the output to be cleared to 0 V . \nThe AD5570 is available in a 16-lead SSOP . \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. 1 LSB maximum INL and DNL. \n2. Buffered voltage output up to ±14 V . \n3. Output controlled during power-up. \n4. On-board reference buffers. \n5.

C | Page 10 of 24 TERMINOLOGY \nRelative Accuracy or Integral Nonlinearity (INL) \nRelative accuracy or integral nonlinearity is a measure of  the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a straight line pass- \ning through the endpoints of the DAC transfer function. \nMonotonicity \nA DAC is monotonic if the output either increases or remains \nconstant for increasing digital inputs. The AD5570 is mono-\ntonic over its full operating temperature range. \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL) \nDifferential nonlinearity is the difference between the measured change and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB maximum ensures \nmonotonicity. \nGain Error \nGain error is the difference between the actual and ideal analog \noutput range, expressed as a percent of the full-scale range. It is \nthe deviation in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from \nthe ideal. \nGain Error Temperature Coefficient \nGain error temperature coefficient is a measure of the change in \ngain error with changes in temperature. It is expressed in ppm/°C. \nNegative Full-Scale Error/Zero Scale Error \nNegative full-scale error is the error in the DAC output voltage when all 0s are loaded into the DAC latch. Ideally, the output voltage, with all 0s in the DAC latch, is −2 V\nREF. \nFull-Scale Error Full-scale error is the error in the DAC output voltage when all 1s are loaded to the DAC latch. Ideally, the output voltage with \nall 1s loaded into the DAC latch is 2 V\nREF − 1 LSB. \nBipolar Zero Error \nBipolar zero error is the deviation of the analog input from the ideal half-scale output of 0.0000 V when the inputs are loaded with 0x8000. Output Voltage Settling Time Output voltage settling time is the amount of time it takes for \nthe output to settle to a specified level for a full-scale input change. \nSlew Rate \nThe slew rate of a device is a limitation in the rate of change of \noutput voltage. The output slewing speed of a voltage-output \nDAC converter is usually limited by the slew rate of the ampli-\nfier used at its output. Slew rate is measured from 10% to 90% \nof the output signal and is given in V/μs. \nDigital-to-Analog Glitch Impulse \nDigital-to-analog glitch impulse is the amount of charge injected into the analog output when the input codes in the DAC register change state. It is specified as the area of the glitch in nV-s and \nis measured when the digital input code changes by 1 LSB at the \nmajor carry transition, that is, from code 0x7FFF to 0x8000. \nBandwidth \nThe reference amplifiers within the DAC have a finite band-width to optimize noise performance. To measure it, a sine wave is applied to the reference input (REFIN), with full-scale code loaded to the DAC. The bandwidth is the frequency at which the output amplitude falls to 3 dB below the input. \nDigital Feedthrough \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into \nthe analog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the DAC, but is measured when the DAC output is not updated. \nSYNC\n is held high, while the SCLK and SDIN signals are tog-\ngled. Digital feedthrough is specified in nV-s and is measured with a full-scale code change on the data bus, that is, from all  \n0s to all 1s, and vice versa. \nPower Supply Sensitivity \nPower supply sensitivity indicates how the output of the DAC is affected by changes in the power supply voltage. \n \n \n \n  AD5570\n \nRev.

C | Page 16 of 24 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD5570 is a single 16-bit serial input, voltage output DAC. It \noperates from supply voltages of ±11.4 V to ±16.5 V , and has a buffered voltage output of up to ±13.6 V . Data is written to the AD5570 in a 16-bit word format, via a 3-wire serial interface. The \ndevice also offers an SDO pin, available for daisy-chaining or \nreadback. \nThe AD5570 incorporates a power-on reset circuit to ensure the \nDAC output powers up to 0 V . The device also has a power-down \npin to reduce the typical current consumption to 16 μA. \nDAC ARCHITECTURE \nThe DAC architecture of the AD5570 consists of a 16-bit, current-\nmode, segmented R-2R DAC. The simplified circuit diagram for \nthe DAC section is shown in Figure 36 . \nThe four MSBs of the 16-bit data word are decoded to drive \n15 switches, E1 to E15. Each of these switches connects one  of the 15 matched resistors to either AGND or IOUT. The \nremaining 12 bits of the data word drive switches S0 to S11  \nof the 12-bit R-2R ladder network. \n2R\nE15VREF\n2R\nE14 E12R\nS11RR R\n2R\nS102R\n12-BIT R-2R LADDERVOUT2R\nS02R\nAGNDIOUTR/8\n4 MSBs DECODED INTO\n15 EQUAL SEGMENTS\n03760-010 \nFigure 36. DAC Ladder Structure \nREFERENCE BUFFERS \nThe AD5570 operates with an external reference. The reference \ninput (REFIN) has an input range of up to 7 V . This input voltage is \nthen used to provide a buffered positive and negative reference \nfor the DAC core. The positive reference is given by \nREFIN REF V V× = +2 \nand the negative reference to the DAC core is given by \nREFIN REF V V× = −2 \nThese positive and negative reference voltages define the DAC \noutput range. \nSERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD5570 is controlled over a versatile 3-wire serial interface \nthat operates at clock rates up to 10 MHz and is compatible with \nSPI, QSPI, MICROWIRE, and DSP interface standards. \nInput Shift Register \nThe input shift register is 16 bits wide. Data is loaded into the \ndevice as a 16-bit word under the control of a serial clock input, \nSCLK. The timing diagram for this operation is shown in Figure 2 . On power-up, the input shift register and DAC register are \nloaded with midscale (0x8000). The DAC coding is straight binary; all 0s produce an output of −2 V\nREF; all 1s produce an \noutput of +2 V REF − 1 LSB. \nThe SYNC  input is a level-triggered input that acts as a frame \nsynchronization signal and chip enable. SYNC  must frame the \nserial word being loaded into the device. Data can be transferred \ninto the device only while SYNC is low. To start the serial data \ntransfer, SYNC  is taken low, observing the minimum SYNC  to \nSCLK falling edge setup time, t 4. After SYNC  goes low, serial data \non SDIN is shifted into the device’s input shift register on the falling edges of SCLK. SYNC\n can be taken high after the falling \nedge of the 16th SCLK pulse, observing the minimum SCLK \nfalling edge to SYNC  rising edge time, t 7. \nAfter the end of the serial data transfer, data is automatically \ntransferred from the input shift register to the input register  \nof the DAC. \nWhen data has been transferred into the input register of the DAC, \nthe DAC register and DAC output can be updated by taking \nLDAC  low while SYNC  is high. \nLoad DAC Input ( LDAC ) \nThere are two ways that the DAC register and DAC output can \nbe updated when data has been transferred into the input register \nof the DAC. Depending on the status of both SYNC  and LDAC , \none of two update modes is selected. \nThe first mode is synchronous LDAC . In this mode, LDAC  is low \nwhile data is being clocked into the input shift register. The DAC \noutput is updated when SYNC  is taken high. The update here \noccurs on the rising edge of SYNC . \nThe second mode is asynchronous LDAC . In this mode, LDAC  \nis high while data is being clocked in. The DAC output is updated by taking LDAC\n low any time after SYNC  has been taken high. \nThe update now occurs on the falling edge of LDAC . \nFigure 37  shows a simplified block diagram of the input loading \ncircuitry. \nVOUT\nDAC\nREGISTER\nINPUT SHIFT\nREGISTEROUTPUT\nI/V AMPLIFIER\nLDAC\nSDO SDIN16-BIT\nDACVREFIN\nSYNC\n03760-012 \nFigure 37.

When the CLR  signal is brought back high, the \noutput stays at 0 V until LDAC  is brought low. The relationship \nbetween LDAC  and CLR  is explained further in . Table 7\nTable 7. Relationships Among PD, CLR , and LDAC   \nPD CLR  LDAC  Comments \n0 x x PD has priority over LDAC  and CLR. The \noutput remains at 0 V through an internal \n20 kΩ resistor. It is still possible to address both the input register and DAC register \nwhen the AD5570 is in power-down.  \n1 0 0 Data is written to the input register and \nDAC register. CLR has higher priority over \nLDAC ; therefore, the output is at 0 V.  \n1 0 1 Data is written to the input register only. \nThe output is at 0 V and remains at 0 V \nwhen CLR is taken back high. \n1 1 0 Data is written to the input register and the \nDAC register. The output is driven to the \nDAC level. \n1 1 1 Data is written to the input register only. The output of the DAC register is unchanged. \n POWER-DOWN ( PD) \nThe power-down pin allows the user to place the AD5570 into \na power-down mode. In power-down mode, power consump-tion is at a minimum; the device typically consumes only 16 μA. \nPOWER-ON RESET \nThe AD5570 contains a power-on reset circuit that controls the \noutput during power-up and power-down. This is useful in appli- \ncations where the known state of the output of the DAC during power-up is important. On power-up and power-down, the output \nof the DAC and V\nOUT, is held at AGND. \nSERIAL DATA OUTPUT (SDO) \nThe SDO is the internal shift registers output. For the AD5570, \nSDO is an internal pull-down only; an external pull-up resistor \nof ~5 kΩ to external logic high is required. SDO pull-down is disabled when the device is in power-down, thus saving current. \nThe availability of SDO allows any number of AD5570s to be \ndaisy-chained together. It also allows for the contents of the DAC \nregister, or any number of DACs daisy-chained together, to be \nread back for diagnostic purposes.  \nDaisy Chaining \nThis mode of operation is designed for multi DAC systems, \nwhere several AD5570s can be connected in cascade as shown \nin Figure 38 . This is done by connecting the control inputs in \nparallel and then daisy-chaining the SDIN and SDO I/Os of each device. An external pull-up resistor of ~5 kΩ on SDO is \nrequired when using the part in daisy-chain mode. \nAs described earlier, when SYNC\n goes low, serial data on SDIN \nis shifted into the input shift register on the falling edge of SCLK. \nIf more than 16 clock pulses are applied, the data ripples out of the shift resister and appears on the SDO line. By connecting \nthis line to the SDIN input on the next AD5570 in the chain, a \nmulti DAC interface can be constructed. \nOne data transfer cycle of 16 SCLK pulses is required for each \nDAC in the system. Therefore, the total number of clock cycles must equal 16 N, where N is the total number of devices in the chain. The first data transfer cycle written into the chain appears at \nthe last DAC in the system on the final data transfer cycle. \nWhen the serial transfer to all devices is complete, take SYNC\n high. \nThis prevents any further data from being clocked into the devices. A continuous SCLK source can be used if SYNC\n is held low  \nfor the correct number of clock cycles. Alternatively, a burst \nclock containing the exact number of clock cycles can be used \nand SYNC  is taken high some time later. The outputs of all the \nDACs in the system can be updated simultaneously using the \nLDAC  signal. \nAD5570  \n \nRev. C | Page 18 of 24 Readback \nThe AD5570 allows the data contained in the DAC register to \nbe read back, if required. As with daisy chaining, an external \npull-up resistor of ~5 kΩ on SDO is required. The data in the \nDAC register is available on SDO on the falling edges of SCLK \nwhen SYNC  is low. On the 16th SCLK edge, SDO is updated to \nrepeat SDIN with a delay of 16 clock cycles.   \nTo read back the contents of the DAC register without writing \nto the part, take SYNC  low while LDAC  is held high.  \nDaisy-chaining readback is also possible through the SDO pin \nof the last device in the DAC chain because the DAC data passes \nthrough the DAC chain with the appropriate latency.\n68HC11*\nMISOSYNCSDIN\nSCLKMOSI\nSCK\nPC7\nPC6 LDAC\nSDO\nSYNCSCLK\nLDAC\nSDO\nSYNCSCLK\nLDAC\nSDOSDIN\nSDIN\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.AD5570*\nAD5570*\nAD5570*VLOGIC\nR\nR\nR\n03760-013 \nFigure 38.

C | Page 19 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nTYPICAL OPERATING CIRCUIT \nFigure 39  shows the typical operating circuit for the AD5570. \nThe only external component needed for this precision 16-bit \nDAC is a single external positive reference. Because the device incorporates reference buffers, it eliminates the need for a negative \nreference, external inverters, precision amplifiers, and resistors. \nThis leads to an overall savings of both cost and board space. \nIn the circuit shown in Figure 39 , V\nDD and V SS are both connected \nto ±15 V , but V DD and V SS can operate supplies from 11.4 V to \n16.5 V .

Typical Operating Circuit \nForce/Sense of AGND \nBecause of the extremely high accuracy of this device, system \ndesign issues (such as grounding and contact resistance) are \nvery important. The AD5570, with ±10 V output, has an LSB \nsize of 305 μV . Therefore, series wiring and connector resistances  \nof very small values can cause voltage drops of an LSB. For this \nreason, the AD5570 offers a force/sense output configuration. \nFigure 40  shows how to connect the AD5570 to the force/sense \namplifier. Where accuracy of the output is important, an ampli-\nfier such as the OP177 is ideal. The OP177 is ultraprecise with offset voltages of 10 μV maximum at room temperature, and off- \nset drift of 0.1 μV/°C maximum. Alternative recommended \namplifiers are the OP1177 and the OP77. For applications where optimization of the circuit for settling time is needed, the AD845  \nis recommended.  \nPrecision Voltage Reference Selection \nTo achieve the optimum performance from the AD5570, give \nspecial attention to the selection of a precision voltage reference. \nThe AD5570 has just one reference input, REFIN. This voltage on REFIN is used to provide a buffered positive and negative reference for the DAC core. Therefore, any error in the voltage \nreference is reflected in the output of the device. 62\n3\n(OTHER CONNECTIONS OMITTED\nFOR CLARITY)OP177*\n*FOR OPTIMUM SETTLING TIME PERFORMANCE,\nTHE AD845 IS RECOMMENDED.\n03760-0451\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9AD5570VSS\nVDD\nCLR\nLDAC\nSYNC\nSCLKSDIN\nSDOREFGND\nREFIN\nREFGND\nV\nOUT\nAGNDS\nAGND\nPD\nDGND\n \nFigure 40. Driving AGND and AGNDS Using a Force/Sense Amplifier \nThe four possible sources of error to consider when choosing  \na voltage reference for high accuracy applications are initial accuracy, long-term drift, temperature coefficient of the out- put voltage, and output voltage noise. \nInitial accuracy on the output voltage of an external reference can \nlead to a full-scale error in the DAC. Therefore, to minimize \nthese errors, a reference with low initial accuracy specification  \nis preferred. Also, choosing a reference with an output trim adjust-ment, such as the ADR425, allows a system designer to trim out system errors by setting the reference voltage to a voltage other \nthan the nominal. The trim adjust ment can also be used at tem-\nperature to trim out any error. \nLong-term drift (LTD) is a measure of how much the reference \ndrifts over time. A reference with a tight long-term drift specifica-tion ensures that the overall solution remains relatively stable \nover its entire lifetime.  \nThe temperature coefficient of a references output voltage \naffects INL, DNL, and TUE. Choose a reference with a tight temperature coefficient specification to reduce the depend ence of the DAC output voltage on ambient conditions.  \nIn high accuracy applications that have a relatively low noise \nbudget, reference output voltage noise needs to be considered.  \nIt is important to choose a reference with as low an output noise voltage as practical for the system resolution required. Precision voltage references, such as the ADR435 (XFET® design), produce low output noise in the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz region. However, as the \ncircuit bandwidth increases, filtering the output of the reference \ncan be required to minimize the output noise.  \nAD5570  \n \nRev. C | Page 20 of 24 Table 8.

The printed circuit board that \nthe AD5570 is mounted on is designed so the analog and dig-ital sections are separated and confined to certain areas of the board. If the AD5570 is in a system where multiple devices require an AGND-to-DGND connection, the connection is \nmade at one point only. The star ground point is established  \nas close as possible to the device.  \nThe AD5570 has ample supply bypassing of 10 μF in parallel \nwith 0.1 μF on each supply located as close to the package as possible, ideally right up against the device. The 10 μF capacitors are the tantalum bead type. The 0.1 μF capacitor has low effective series resistance (ESR) and effective series inductance (ESI) such as the common ceramic types that provide a low imped-\nance path to ground at high frequencies to handle transient \ncurrents due to internal logic switching. \nThe power supply lines of the AD5570 use as large a trace as pos-\nsible to provide low impedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals such as clocks are shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other parts of the board, and are never be run near the refer-\nence inputs. A ground line routed between the SDIN and SCLK \nlines reduces crosstalk between them; this is not required on a multilayer board that has a separate ground plane, but separating the lines helps. It is essential to minimize noise on the REFIN \nline because it couples through to the DAC output. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Traces on opposite \nsides of the board must run at right angles to each other.  \nThis reduces the effects of feed through the board. A micro-\nstrip technique is by far the best, but not always possible  with a double-sided board. In this technique, the component side of the board is dedicated to ground plane, while signal \ntraces are placed on the solder side.  \nOPTO-ISOLATORS \nIn many process control applications, it is necessary to provide \nan isolation barrier between the controller and the unit being \ncontrolled. Opto-isolators provide voltage isolation in excess of \n3 kV . The serial loading structure of the AD5570 makes it ideal \nfor opto-isolated interfaces, because the number of interface lines  is kept to a minimum.

C | Page 21 of 24 MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING \nMicroprocessor interfacing to the AD5570 is via a serial bus \nthat uses standard protocol compatible with microcontrollers \nand DSP processors. The communications channel is a 3-wire (minimum) interface consisting of a clock signal, a data signal, \nand a synchronization signal. The AD5570 requires a 16-bit \ndata word with data valid on the falling edge of SCLK. \nFor all the interfaces, the DAC output update can be done auto-\nmatically when all the data is clocked in, or it can be done under \nthe control of LDAC\n. The contents of the DAC register can be \nread using the readback function. \nAD5570 to MC68HC11 Interface \nFigure 42  shows an example of a serial interface between the \nAD5570 and the MC68HC11 microcontroller. The serial periph-\neral interface (SPI) on the MC68HC11 is configured for master \nmode (MSTR = 1), clock polarity bit (CPOL = 0), and the clock phase bit (CPHA = 1). The SPI is configured by writing to the SPI \ncontrol register (SPCR); see documentation on the MC68HC11. \nSCK of the MC68HC11 drives the SCLK of the AD5570, the MOSI output drives the serial data line (SDIN) of the AD5570, \nand the MISO input is driven from SDO. The SYNC\n is driven \nfrom one of the port lines, in this case, PC7. \nWhen data is being transmitted to the AD5570, the SYNC  line \n(PC7) is taken low and data is transmitted MSB first. Data appear-\ning on the MOSI output is valid on the falling edge of SCK. Eight \nfalling clock edges occur in the transmit cycle; therefore, in order  \nto load the required 16-bit word, PC7 is not brought high until the second 8-bit word has been transferred to the DACs input \nshift register.  \nAD5570*\nSCLKSDIN\nSYNCMOSI\nSCLK\nPC7MC68HC11*\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.SDO MISO\n03760-014 \nFigure 42.

This \nexample does not show other serial lines for the DAC. If CLR  \nwere used, control it by the Port Output PC5. \nAD5570 to 8xC51 Interface \nThe AD5570 requires a clock synchronized to the serial data. For \nthis reason, the 8xC51 must be operated in Mode 0. In this mode, \nserial data enters and exits through RxD, and a shift clock is \noutput on TxD.  \nP3.3 and P3.4 are bit-programmable pins on the serial port and \nare used to drive SYNC  and LDAC , respectively. \nThe 8xC51 provides the LSB of its SBUF register as the first bit \nin the data stream. The user must ensure that the data in the SBUF \nregister is arranged correctly because the DAC expects MSB first. \nAD5570*\nSCLKSDIN\nSYNCTxD\nP3.38xC51*\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.RxD\nLDAC P3.4\n03760-015 \nFigure 43. AD5570 to 8xC51 Interface \nWhen data is to be transmitted to the DAC, P3.3 is taken low. Data \non RxD is clocked out of the microcontroller on the rising edge of TxD and is valid on the falling edge. As a result, no glue logic \nis required between this DAC and the microcontroller interface.  \nThe 8xC51 transmits data in 8-bit bytes with only eight falling \nclock edges occurring in the transmit cycle. Because the DAC \nexpects a 16-bit word, SYNC\n (P3.3) must be left low after the first \neight bits are transferred. After the second byte has been trans-\nferred, the P3.3 line is taken high. The DAC can be updated using \nLDAC  via P3.4 of the 8xC51.\n \nAD5570  \n \nRev. C | Page 22 of 24 AD5570 to ADSP21xx \nAn interface between the AD5570 and the ADSP21xx family is \nshown in Figure 44 . The ADSP21xx must be set up to operate in \nthe SPORT transmit alternate framing mode. The ADSP21xx is programmed through the SPORT control register and is con-\nfigured as follows: internal clock operation, active low framing, \nand 16-bit word length. \nTransmission is initiated by writing a word to the Tx register, after \nthe SPORT has been enabled. As the data is clocked out of the DSP on the rising edge of SCLK, no glue logic is required to inter-\nface the DSP to the DAC. In the interface shown, the DAC output \nis updated using the LDAC\n pin via the DSP . Alternatively, the \nLDAC  input can be tied permanently low, and then the update \nis automatic when TFS is taken high. \nAD5570*\nSCLKSDIN\nSYNCDT\nSCLK\nRFSADSP21xx\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.SDO DR\nTFS\nLDAC FO\n03760-016 \nFigure 44.
