The driver is available with either TTL (FAN3100T)\nor CMOS (FAN3100C) input thresholds. Internal circuitry provides\nan under−voltage lockout function by holding the output LOW until\nthe supply voltage is within the operating range. The FAN3100delivers fast MOSFET switching performance, which helps maximize\nefficiency in high −frequency power converter designs.\nFAN3100 drivers incorporate MillerDrive /C0116 architecture\nfor the final output stage. This bipolar −MOSFET combination\nprovides high peak current during the Miller plateau stage\nof the MOSFET turn −on / turn−off process to minimize switching\nloss, while providing rail −to−rail voltage swing and reverse current\ncapability.\nThe FAN3100 also offers dual inputs that can be configured\nto operate in non −inverting or inverting mode and allow\nimplementation of an enable function. If one or both inputs are leftunconnected, internal resistors bias the inputs such that the output ispulled LOW to hold the power MOSFET off.\nThe FAN3100 is available in a lead −free finish, 2x2 mm, 6 −lead,\nMolded Leadless Package (MLP) for the smallest size with excellentthermal performance; or industry −standard, 5 −pin, SOT23.\nFeatures\n•3 A Peak Sink/Source at V DD = 12 V\n•4.5 to 18 V Operating Range\n•2.5 A Sink/1.8 A Source at V OUT = 6 V\n•Dual−Logic Inputs Allow Configuration as Non −Inverting or\nInverting with Enable Function\n•Internal Resistors Turn Driver Off If No Inputs\n•13 ns Typical Rise Time and 9 ns Typical Fall −Time with 1 nF Load\n•Choice of TTL or CMOS Input Thresholds\n•MillerDrive Technology\n•Typical Propagation Delay Time Under 20 ns with Input Falling or\nRising\n•6−Lead, 2x2 mm MLP or 5 −Pin, SOT23 Packages\n•Rated from –40 °C to 125 °C Ambient\n•These Devices are Pb −Free and Halogen Free\nApplications\n•Switch−Mode Power Supplies (SMPS)\n•High−Efficiency MOSFET Switching\n•Synchronous Rectifier Circuits\n•DC−to−DC ConvertersMARKING DIAGRAM\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information on page 17 of\nthis data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATIONSOT23−5\nCASE 527AH\n&E = Designates Space\n&Y = Binary Calendar Year Coding Scheme\n&O = Plant Code identifier 100X = Device Specific Code\nX = T or C\n&C = Single digit Die Run Code \n&. = Pin One Dot &V = Eight −Week Binary Datecoding SchemePIN ASSIGNMENT\n6−Lead MLP (T op View)\nSOT23−5 (Top View)\n&E&E&Y\n&O100X&C\n&.&O&E&V1 6\n5 2\n4 3IN+\nAGND\nVDDIN−\nPGND\nOUT\n1\n2\n35\n4VDD\nGND\nIN+ IN/C0042OUT\nWDFN6 2x2, 065P\nCASE 511CY\nFAN3100T, FAN3100C\nwww. onsemi.com\n2•Motor Control\nBLOCK DIAGRAMS\nTHERMAL CHARACTERISTICS (Note 1)\nPackage/C0081JL\n(Note 2)/C0081JT\n(Note 3)/C0081JA\n(Note 4)/C0089JB\n(Note 5)/C0089JT\n(Note 6) Unit\n6−Lead, 2x2 mm Molded Leadless Package (MLP) 2.7 133 58 2.8 42 °C/W\nSOT23, 5 −Lead 56 99 157 51 5 °C/W\n1.

Quasi −Static I OUT  / VOUT Test Circuit\nFAN3100T, FAN3100C\nwww. onsemi.com\n12APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInput Threshold\nThe FAN3100 offers TTL or CMOS input thresholds. In\nthe FAN3100T, the input thresholds meet industry −standard\nTTL logic thresholds, independent of the V DD voltage, and\nthere is a hysteresis voltage of approximately 0.4 V . Theselevels permit the inputs to be driven from a range of input\nlogic signal levels for which a voltage over 2 V is considered\nlogic HIGH. The driving signal for the TTL inputs should\nhave fast rising and falling edges with a slew rate of 6 V/ /C0109s\nor faster, so the rise time from 0 to 3.3 V should be 550 nsor less. With reduced slew rate, circuit noise could causethe driver input voltage to exceed the hysteresis voltage and\nretrigger the driver input, causing erratic operation. In theFAN3100C, the logic input thresholds are dependent on\nthe V\nDD level and, with V DD of 12 V , the logic rising edge\nthreshold is approximately 55% of V DD and the input falling\nedge threshold is approximately 38% of V DD. The CMOS\ninput configuration offers a hysteresis voltage ofapproximately 17% of V\nDD. The CMOS inputs can be used\nwith relatively slow edges (approaching DC) if gooddecoupling and bypass techniques are incorporated inthe system design to prevent noise from violating the input\nvoltage hysteresis window. This allows setting precise\ntiming intervals by fitting an R −C circuit between\nthe controlling signal and the IN pin of the driver. The slow\nrising edge at the IN pin of the driver introduces a delaybetween the controlling signal and the OUT pin of the driver.\nStatic Supply Current\nIn the I DD (static) typical performance graphs\n(Figure 5 −Figure 6 and Figure 11 − Figure 12), the curve is\nproduced with all inputs floating (OUT is LOW) andindicates the lowest static I\nDD current for the tested\nconfiguration. For other states, additional current flows\nthrough the 100 k /C0087 resistors on the inputs and outputs\nshown in the block diagrams (Figure 1 − Figure 2) . In these\ncases, the actual static I DD current is the value obtained from\nthe curves plus this additional current.\nMillerDrive /C0116 Gate Drive Technology\nFAN3100 drivers incorporate the MillerDrive\narchitecture shown in Figure 38 for the output stage, a\ncombination of bipolar and MOS devices capable of\nproviding large currents over a wide range of supply voltage\nand temperature variations. The bipolar devices carry thebulk of the current as OUT swings between 1/3 to 2/3 V\nDD\nand the MOS devices pull the output to the high or low rail.\nThe purpose of the MillerDrive architecture is to speed up\nswitching by providing the highest current during the Millerplateau region when the gate −drain capacitance of the\nMOSFET is being charged or discharged as part of the\nturn−on / turn−off process. For applications that have zero\nvoltage sw itching during the MOSFET turn −on or turn −off\ninterval, the driver supplies high peak current for fastswitching even though the Miller plateau is not present. Thissituation often occurs in synchronous rectifier applications\nbecause the body diode is generally conducting before theMOSFET is switched on. The output pin slew rate is\ndetermined by V\nDD voltage and the load on the output. It is\nnot user adjustable, but if a slower rise or fall time at theMOSFET gate is needed, a series resistor can be added.\nFigure 38. MillerDrive /C0116 Output ArchitectureInput\nstage VOUTVDD\nUnder−Voltage Lockout\nThe FAN3100 start −up logic is optimized to drive ground\nreferenced N −channel MOSFETs with a under −voltage\nlockout (UVLO) function to ensure that the IC starts up inan orderly fashion. When V\nDD is rising, yet below the 3.9 V\noperational level, this circuit holds the output LOW,\nregardless of the status of the input pins. After the part is\nactive, the supply voltage must drop 0.2 V before the partshuts down. This hysteresis helps prevent chatter when low\nV\nDD supply voltages have noise from the power switching.\nThis configuration is not suitable for driving high −side\nP−channel MOSFETs because the low output voltage of the\ndriver would turn the P −channel MOSFET on with V DD\nbelow 3.9 V .\nVDD Bypass Capacitor Guidelines\nTo enable this IC to turn a power device on quickly, a local,\nhigh−frequency, bypass capacitor C BYP with low ESR and\nESL should be connected between the VDD and GND pins\nwith minimal trace length. This capacitor is in addition to\nbulk electrolytic capacitance of 10 /C0109F to 47 /C0109F often found\non driver and controller bias circuits.\nA typical criterion for choosing the value of C BYP is to\nkeep the ripple voltage on the V DD supply ≤5%. Often this\nis achieved with a value ≥ 20 times the equivalent load\ncapacitance C EQV, defined here as Q gate/VDD. Ceramic\ncapacitors of 0.1 /C0109F to 1 /C0109F or larger are common choices,\nas are dielectrics, such as X5R and X7R, which have good\ntemperature characteristics and high pulse currentcapability.\nFAN3100T, FAN3100C\nwww. onsemi.com\n13If circuit noise affects normal operation, the value of C BYP\nmay be increased to 50 −100 times the C EQV, or C BYP may\nbe split into two capacitors. One should be a larger value,\nbased on equivalent load capacitance, and the other a smaller\nvalue, such as 1 −10 nF, mounted closest to the VDD and\nGND pins to carry the higher −frequency components of\nthe current pulses.\nLayout and Connection Guidelines\nThe FAN3100 incorporates fast −reacting input circuits,\nshort propagation delays, and powerful output stagescapable of delivering current peaks over 2 A to facilitatevoltage transition times from under 10 ns to over 100 ns.The following layout and connection guidelines are stronglyrecommended:\n•Keep high −current output and power ground paths\nseparate from logic input signals and signal ground\npaths. This is especially critical when dealing with\nTTL−level logic thresholds.\n•Keep the driver as close to the load as possible to\nminimize the length of high −current traces. This\nreduces the series inductance to improve high −speed\nswitching, while reducing the loop area that can radiate\nEMI to the driver inputs and other surrounding\ncircuitry.\n•The FAN3100 is available in two packages with\nslightly different pinouts, offering similar performance.\nIn the 6−pin MLP package, Pin 2 is internally\nconnected to the input analog ground and should be\nconnected to power ground, Pin 5, through a shortdirect path underneath the IC. In the 5 −pin SOT23, the\ninternal analog and power ground connections are made\nthrough separate, individual bond wires to Pin 2, whichshould be used as the common ground point for power\nand control signals.\n•Many high −speed power circuits can be susceptible to\nnoise injected from their own output or other external\nsources, possibly causing output re −triggering. These\neffects can be especially obvious if the circuit is tested\nin breadboard or non −optimal circuit layouts with long\ninput, enable, or output leads. For best results, makeconnections to all pins as short and direct as possible.\n•The turn−on and turn −off current paths should be\nminimized as discussed in the following sections.\nFigure 39 shows the pulsed gate drive current path when\nthe gate driver is supplying gate charge to turn the MOSFET\non. The current is supplied from the local bypass capacitor,C\nBYP, and flows through the driver to the MOSFET gate and\nto ground. To reach the high peak currents possible, theresistance and inductance in the path should be minimized.\nThe localized C\nBYP acts to contain the high peak current\npulses within this driver −MOSFET circuit, preventing them\nfrom disturbing the sensitive analog circuitry in the PWM\ncontroller.Figure 39. Current Path for MOSFET Turn −OnPWMFAN3100CBYPVDD VDS\nFigure 40 shows the current path when the gate driver\nturns the MOSFET off. Ideally, the driver shunts the current\ndirectly to the source of the MOSFET in a small circuit loop.\nFor fast turn −off times, the resistance and inductance in this\npath should be minimized.\nFigure 40. Current Path for MOSFET Turn −OffPWMFAN3100CBYPVDDVDS\nTruth Table of Logic Operation\nThe truth table indicates the operational states using the\ndual−input configuration. In a non −inverting driver\nconfiguration, the IN− pin should be a logic LOW signal. If\nthe IN− pin is connected to logic HIGH, a disable function\nis realized, and the driver output remains LOW regardless of\nthe state of the IN+ pin.\nTable 1.

The magnitude\nof the OUT pulses rises with V DD until steady −state V DD is\nreached. The non −inverting operation illustrated in\nFigure 43 shows that the output remains LOW until theUVLO threshold is reached, then the output is in −phase with\nthe input.\nFigure 43.

It is\nimportant to determine the driver power dissipation and the\nresulting junction temperature in the application to ensurethat the part is operating within acceptable temperature\nlimits.\nThe total power dissipation in a gate driver is the sum of\ntwo components; P\nGATE and P DYNAMIC :\nPTOTAL/C0043PGATE/C0041PDYNAMIC (eq. 1)\nGate Driving Loss: The most significant power loss\nresults from supplying gate current (charge per unit time) to\nswitch the load MOSFET on and off at the switching\nfrequency.

The typical gate charge would be 32 nC\nwith V\nGS = V DD = 10 V . Using a TTL input driver at\na switching frequency of 500 kHz, the total power\ndissipation can be calculated as:\nPGATE/C004332nC/C006410V/C0064500kHz /C00430.160W (eq. 5)\nPDYNAMIC/C00438mA/C006410V/C00430.080W (eq. 6)\nPTOTAL/C00430.24W (eq. 7)The 5−pin SOT23 has a junction −to−lead thermal\ncharacterization parameter /C0089JB = 51 °C/W.\nIn a system application, the localized temperature around\nthe device is a function of the layout and construction of the\nPCB along with airflow across the surfaces. To ensurereliable operation, the maximum junction temperature of the\ndevice must be prevented from exceeding the maximumrating of 150 °C; with 80% derating, T\nJ would be limited to\n120°C. Rearranging Equation 4 determines the board\ntemperature required to maintain the junction temperaturebelow 120 °C:\nTB,MAX/C0043TJ/C0042PTOTAL/C0064/C0089JB (eq. 8)\nTB,MAX/C0043120°C/C00420.24W /C006451°C/C0324W/C0043108°C(eq. 9)\nFor comparison purposes, replace the 5 −pin SOT23 used\nin the previous example with the 6 −pin MLP package with\n/C0089JB = 2.8 °C/W. The 6 −pin MLP package can operate at a\nPCB temperature of 119 °C, while maintaining the junction\ntemperature below 120 °C. This illustrates that the\nphysically smaller MLP package with thermal pad offers a\nmore conductive path to remove the heat from the driver.Consider the tradeoffs between reducing overall circuit size\nwith junction temperature reduction for increasedreliability.\nFAN3100T, FAN3100C\nwww. onsemi.com\n16Figure 45.
