www.ti.com\n2 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\n5 Description (continued)\nThe BQ25601  feature s fast charging with high input voltage support for a wide range of smartphones, tablets \nand portable devices. Its input voltage and current regulation deliver maximum charging power to the battery. \nIt also integrates a bootstrap diode for the high-side gate drive for simplified system design. The I2C serial \ninterface with charging and system settings makes the device a truly flexible solution.\nThe device supports a wide range of input sources, including standard USB host port, USB charging port, and \nUSB compliant high voltage adapter. The device sets the default input current limit based on the built-in USB \ninterface.  To set the default input current limit, the device takes the result from the detection circuit in the system, \nsuch as USB PHY device.  The device is compliant with the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 power specs with input current \nand voltage regulation. The device also meets the USB On-the-Go (OTG) operation power rating specification by \nsupplying 5.15 V on VBUS with a constant current limit up to 1.2 A .\nThe power path management regulates the system slightly above battery voltage but does not drop below the \n3.5-V minimum system voltage  (programmable) . With this feature, the system maintains operation even when \nthe battery is completely depleted or removed. When the input current limit or voltage limit is reached, the \npower path management automatically reduces the charge current  to zero . As the system load continues to \nincrease, the power path discharges the battery until the system power requirement is met. This Supplement \nmode prevents overloading the input source.\nThe device initiates and completes a charging cycle without software control. It senses battery voltage and \ncharges the battery in three phases: pre-conditioning, constant current, and constant voltage. At the end of \nthe charging cycle, the charger automatically terminates when the charge current is below a preset limit and \nthe battery voltage is higher than the recharge threshold. If the fully charged battery falls below the recharge \nthreshold, the charger automatically starts another charging cycle.\nThe charger provides various safety features for battery charging and system operations including: \nbattery negative temperature coefficient thermistor monitoring, charging safety timer, and overvoltage and \novercurrent protections. The thermal regulation reduces charge current when the junction temperature exceeds \n110°C (programmable) . The STAT output reports charging status and any fault conditions. Other safety features \ninclude battery temperature sensing for charge and boost mode, thermal regulation and thermal shutdown, and \ninput UVLO and overvoltage protection. The VBUS_GD bit indicates if a good power source is present. The INT \noutput immediately notifies the host when a fault occurs.\nThe device also provides the QON  pin for BATFET enable and reset control to exit low power ship mode or the \nfull system reset function.\nThe device is available in a 24-pin, 4 mm × 4 mm x 0.75 mm thin WQFN package  .\nwww.ti.comBQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\n6 Device Comparison Table\nBQ25601 BQ25601D BQ25611D\nProgrammable charge voltage 3.856 - 4.624 V, 32 mV per step 3.856 - 4.624 V, 32 mV per step 3.5 - 4.3 V (100 mV per step); \n4.3 - 4.52 V (10 mV per step)\nD+/D- USB detection No Yes Yes\nDefault I CHG 2.04 A 2.04 A 1 A\nDefault V ACOV 6.4 V 6.4 V 14.2 V\nVBUS OVP reaction time 200 ns 200 ns 130 ns\nBattery remote sensing with open/\nshort detectionNo No Yes\nTS profile JEITA, with fixed temperature \nthresholdsJEITA, with fixed temperature \nthresholdsJEITA, with adjustable \ntemperature thresholds\nTS ignore bit No No Yes\nCharge safety timer 5 hr, 10 hr (default) 5 hr, 10 hr (default) 20 hr, 10 hr (default)\nAllow QON  fire when adapter is \npresentNo No Yes\nDeglitch time for charge ternination 250 ms 250 ms 50 msBQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\n7 Pin Configuration and Functions\n18 GND\n17 GND\n16 SYS\n15\n14 BAT\n13SYS\nBAT\n(Not to scale)Thermal\nPad1 VAC\n2 PSEL\n3 PG\n4 STAT\n5 SCL\n6 SDA\n22PMID\n21REGN\n20BTST\n19SW\nSW2423VBUS\nINT\nNC NC\nTS\nQONCE7 8 11 12 9 10\nFigure 7-1.

When VBUS rises above \nVVBUS_UVLOZ  or BAT rises above V BAT_UVLOZ  , the sleep comparator, battery depletion comparator and BATFET \ndriver are active. I2C interface is ready for communication and all the registers are reset to default value. The \nhost can access all the registers after POR.\n9.3.2 Device Power Up from Battery without Input Source\nIf only battery is present and the voltage is above depletion threshold (V BAT _DPL_RISE) , the BATFET turns on and \nconnects battery to system. The REGN stays off to minimize the quiescent current. The low RDSON of BATFET \nand the low quiescent current on BAT minimize the conduction loss and maximize the battery run time.\nThe device always monitors the discharge current through BATFET (Supplement Mode). When the system is \noverloaded or shorted (I BAT > IBATFET_OCP ), the device turns off BATFET immediately and set BATFET_DIS bit to \nindicate BATFET is disabled until the input source plugs in again or one of the methods described in BATFET \nEnable (Exit Shipping Mode) is applied to re-enable BATFET.\n9.3.3 Power Up from Input Source\nWhen an input source is plugged in, the device checks the input source voltage to turn on REGN LDO and all \nthe bias circuits. It detects and sets the input current limit before the buck converter is started. The power-up \nsequence from input source is as listed:\n1.Power up REGN LDO\n2.Poor source qualification\n3.Input source type detection is based on or PSEL  to set default  input current limit (IINDPM) register or input \nsource type .\n4.Input voltage limit threshold setting (VINDPM threshold)\n5.Converter power up\n9.3.3.1 Power Up REGN Regulation\nThe REGN LDO supplies internal bias circuits as well as the HSFET and LSFET gate drive. The REGN also \nprovides bias rail to TS external resistors. The pull-up rail of STAT can be connected to REGN as well. The \nREGN is enabled when all the below conditions are valid:\n•VVAC above V VAC_PRESENT\n•VVAC above V BAT + V SLEEPZ  in buck mode or VBUS below V BAT + V SLEEP  in boost mode\n•After 220-ms delay is completed\nIf any one of the above conditions is not valid, the device is in high impedance mode (HIZ) with REGN LDO off. \nThe device draws less than IVBUS_HIZ from VBUS during HIZ state. The battery powers up the system when \nthe device is in HIZ.\n9.3.3.2 Poor Source Qualification\nAfter REGN LDO powers up, the device confirms the current capability of the input source. The input source \nmust meet both of the following requirements in order to start the buck converter.\n•VBUS  voltage below V VAC_OV\n•VBUS voltage above V VBUSMIN  when pulling I BADSRC  (typical 30 mA)\nOnce the input source passes all the conditions above, the status register bit VBUS_GD is set high and the INT \npin is pulsed to signal to the host. If the device fails the poor source detection, it repeats poor source qualification \nevery 2 seconds.\n9.3.3.3 Input Source Type Detection\nAfter the VBUS_GD bit is set and  REGN LDO is powered, the device runs input source detection through the \nPSEL pin . The BQ25601  sets input current limit through PSEL pins.BQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\nAfter input source type detection is completed, an INT pulse is asserted to the host. in addition, the following \nregisters and pin are changed:\n1.Input Current Limit (IINDPM) register is changed to set current limit\n2.PG_STAT bit is set\n3.VBUS_STAT bit is updated to indicate USB or other input source\nThe host can overwrite IINDPM register to change the input current limit if needed. The charger input current is \nalways limited by the IINDPM register.\n9.3.3.3.1 PSEL Pins Sets Input Current Limit in BQ25601\nThe BQ25601  has PSEL pin for input current limit setting to interface with USB PHY. It directly takes the USB \nPHY device output to decide whether the input is USB host or charging port. When the device operates in \nhost-control mode, the host needs to IINDET_EN bit to read the PSEL value and update the IINDPM register. \nWhen the device is in default mode, PSEL value updates IINDPM in real time.\nTable 9-1. Input Current Limit Setting from PSEL \nINPUT DETECTION PSEL PININPUT CURRENT LIMIT \n(ILIM)VBUS_STAT\nUSB SDP High 500 mA 001\nAdapter Low 2.4A 011\n9.3.3.4 Input Voltage Limit Threshold Setting (VINDPM Threshold)\nThe device supports wide range of input voltage limit (3.9 V to 5.4 V) for USB.  The device VINDPM is set at 4.5 \nV. The device supports dynamic VINDPM tracking settings  which tracks the battery voltage. This function can be \nenabled via the VDPM_BAT_TRACK[1:0] register bits. When enabled, the actual input voltage limit will be the \nhigher of the VINDPM register and VBAT + VDPM_BAT_TRACK offset.\n9.3.3.5 Converter Power Up\nAfter the input current limit is set, the converter is enabled and the HSFET and LSFET start switching. If battery \ncharging is disabled, BATFET turns off. Otherwise, BATFET stays on to charge the battery.\nThe device provides soft start when system rail is ramped up. When the system rail is below 2.2 V, the input \ncurrent is limited to is to the lower of  200 mA or IINDPM register setting . After the system rises above 2.2 V, the \ndevice limits input current to the value set by IINDPM register .\nAs a battery charger, the device deploys a highly efficient 1.5 MHz step-down switching regulator. The fixed \nfrequency oscillator keeps tight control of the switching frequency under all conditions of input voltage, battery \nvoltage, charge current and temperature, simplifying output filter design.\nThe device switches to PFM control at light load or when battery is below minimum system voltage setting \nor charging is disabled. The PFM_DIS bit can be used to prevent PFM operation in either buck or boost \nconfiguration.  PFM mode is only enabled when IINDPM is set ≥ 500 mA.

The boost output is maintained when \nBAT is above V OTG_BAT  threshold.\nWhen OTG is enabled, the device starts up with PFM and later transits to PWM to minimize the overshoot. The \nPFM_DIS bit can be used to prevent PFM operation in either buck or boost configuration.\n9.3.5 Host Mode and  Standalone Power Management\n9.3.5.1 Host Mode and Default Mode in BQ25601\nThe BQ25601  is a host controlled charger, but it can operate in default mode without host management. in \ndefault mode, the device can be used as an autonomous charger with no host or while host is in sleep mode. \nWhen the charger is in default mode, WATCHDOG_FAULT bit is HIGH. When the charger is in host mode, \nWATCHDOG_FAULT bit is LOW.\nAfter power-on-reset, the device starts in default mode with watchdog timer expired, or default mode. All the \nregisters are in the default settings. During default mode, any change on PSEL pin will make real time IINDPM \nregister changes.\nIn default mode, the device keeps charging the battery with default 10-hour fast charging safety timer. At the end \nof the 10-hour, the charging is stopped and the buck converter continues to operate to supply system load.\nWriting a 1 to the WD_RST bit transitions the charger from default mode to host mode. All the device parameters \ncan be programmed by the host. To keep the device in host mode, the host has to reset the watchdog timer by \nwriting 1 to WD_RST bit before the watchdog timer expires (WATCHDOG_FAULT bit is set), or disable watchdog \ntimer by setting WATCHDOG bits = 00.\nWhen the watchdog timer expires (WATCHDOG_FAULT bit = 1), the device returns to default mode and \nall registers are reset to default values except IINDPM, VINDPM, BATFET_RST_EN, BATFET_DLY, and \nBATFET_DIS bits.\nPOR\nwatchdog timer expired\nReset registers\nI2C interface enabled\nY\nN\nY\nN\nYN YNDefault Mode\nReset watchdog timer\nReset selective registersHost Mode\nStart watchdog timer\nHost programs registers\nWD_RST bit = 1?

The device default charging parameters are listed in Table 9-2 . \nThe host can always control the charging operations and optimize the charging parameters by writing to the \ncorresponding registers through I2C.\nTable 9-2.

After the charge is done, toggle CE pin or CHG_CONFIG bit \ncan initiate a new charging cycle.\nThe STAT output indicates the charging status: charging (LOW), charging complete or charge disable (HIGH) \nor charging fault (blinking). The STAT output can be disabled by setting EN_ICHG_MON bits = 11. in addition, \nthe status register (CHRG_STAT) indicates the different charging phases: 00-charging disable, 01-precharge, \n10-fast charge (constant current) and constant voltage mode, 11-charging done. Once a charging cycle is \ncompleted, an INT is asserted to notify the host.\n9.3.7.2 Battery Charging Profile\nThe device charges the battery in five phases: battery short, preconditioning, constant current, constant voltage \nand top-off trickle charging (optional). At the beginning of a charging cycle, the device checks the battery voltage \nand regulates current and voltage accordingly.\nTable 9-3.

Battery Charging Profile\n9.3.7.3 Charging Termination\nThe device terminates a charge cycle when the battery voltage is above recharge threshold, and the current \nis below termination current. After the charging cycle is completed, the BATFET turns off. The converter keeps \nrunning to power the system, and BATFET can turn on again to engage Supplement Mode.\nWhen termination occurs, the status register CHRG_STAT is set to 11, and an INT pulse is asserted to the host. \nTermination is temporarily disabled when the charger device is in input current, voltage, or thermal regulation . \nTermination can be disabled by writing 0 to EN_TERM bit prior to charge termination.\nAt low termination currents, due to the comparator offset, the actual termination current may be 10 mA-20 mA \nhigher than the termination target. in order to compensate for comparator offset, a programmable top-off timer \ncan be applied after termination is detected. The termination timer will follow safety timer constraints, such that if \nsafety timer is suspended, so will the termination timer. Similarly, if safety timer is doubled, so will the termination \ntimer. TOPOFF_ACTIVE bit reports whether the top off timer is active or not. The host can read CHRG_STAT \nand TOPOFF_ACTIVE to find out the termination status.\nTop off timer gets reset at one of the following conditions:\n1.Charge disable to enable\n2.Termination status low to high\n3.REG_RST register bit is set\nThe top-off timer settings are read in once termination is detected by the charger. Programming a top-off timer \nvalue after termination will have no effect unless a recharge cycle is initiated. An INT is asserted to the host \nwhen entering top-off timer segment as well as when top-off timer expires.\n9.3.7.4 Thermistor Qualification\nThe charger device provides a single thermistor input for battery temperature monitor.\n9.3.7.5 JEITA Guideline Compliance During Charging Mode\nTo improve the safety of charging Li-ion batteries, JEITA guideline was released on April 20, 2007. The guideline \nemphasized the importance of avoiding a high charge current and high charge voltage at certain low and high \ntemperature ranges.BQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\nTo initiate a charge cycle, the voltage on TS pin must be within the VT1 to VT5 thresholds. If TS voltage exceeds \nthe T1-T5 range, the controller suspends charging and waits until the battery temperature is within the T1 to T5 \nrange.\nAt cool temperature (T1-T2), JEITA recommends the charge current to be reduced to half of the charge current \nor lower. At warm temperature (T3-T5), JEITA recommends charge voltage less than 4.1 V. Charge termination \nis disabled for cool and warm conditions.\nThe charger provides flexible voltage/current settings beyond the JEITA requirement. The voltage setting at \nwarm temperature (T3-T5) can be VREG or 4.1V (configured by JEITA_VSET).

TS Pin Thermistor Sense Threshold in Boost Mode\n9.3.7.7 Charging Safety Timer\nThe device has built-in safety timer to prevent extended charging cycle due to abnormal battery conditions. The \nsafety timer is two hours when the battery is below V BATLOWV  threshold and 10 hours when the battery is higher \nthan V BATLOWV  threshold.\nThe user can program fast charge safety timer through I2C (CHG_TIMER bits). When safety timer expires, the \nfault register CHRG_FAULT bits are set to 11 and an INT is asserted to the host. The safety timer feature can be \ndisabled through I2C by setting EN_TIMER bit.\nDuring input voltage, current, JEITA cool or thermal regulation, the safety timer counts at half clock rate as the \nactual charge current is likely to be below the register setting. For example, if the charger is in input current \nregulation (IDPM_STAT = 1) throughout the whole charging cycle, and the safety time is set to five hours, the \nsafety timer will expire in 10 hours. This half clock rate feature can be disabled by writing 0 to TMR2X_EN bit.\nDuring the fault, timer is suspended. Once the fault goes away, the timer resumes counting. If user stops the \ncurrent charging cycle, and start again, timer gets reset (toggle CE pin or CHRG_CONFIG bit).\n9.3.8 Protections\n9.3.8.1 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Converter Operation\nThe device closely monitors the input and system voltage, as well as internal FET currents for safe buck and \nboost mode operation.\n9.3.8.1.1 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Buck Mode\n9.3.8.1.1.1 Input Overvoltage (ACOV)\nIf VBUS voltage exceeds V VAC_OV  (programmable via OVP[2:0] bits), the device stops switching immediately.BQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\nDuring input overvoltage event (ACOV), the fault register CHRG_FAULT bits are set to 01. An INT pulse is \nasserted to the host. The device will automatically resume normal operation once the input voltage drops back \nbelow the OVP threshold.\n9.3.8.1.1.2 System Overvoltage Protection (SYSOVP)\nThe charger device clamps the system voltage during load transient so that the components connect to system \nwould not be damaged due to high voltage. SYSOVP threshold is 350 mV above minimum system regulation \nvoltage when the system is regulate at V SYS_MIN . Upon SYSOVP, converter stops switching immediately to \nclamp the overshoot. The charger provides 30-mA discharge current (I SYSLOAD ) to bring down the system \nvoltage.\n9.3.8.2 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Boost Mode\nThe device closely monitors the VBUS voltage, as well as RBFET and LSFET current to ensure safe boost mode \noperation.\n9.3.8.2.1 VBUS Soft Start\nWhen the boost function is enabled, the device soft-starts boost mode to avoid inrush current.\n9.3.8.2.2 VBUS Output Protection\nThe device monitors boost output voltage and other conditions to provide output short circuit and overvoltage \nprotection. The boost build in accurate constant current regulation to allow OTG to adapt to various types of \nload. If a short circuit is detected on VBUS, boost turns off and retries 7 times. If retries are not successful, OTG \nis disabled with OTG_CONFIG bit cleared. In addition, the BOOST_FAULT bit is set and INT pulse is generated. \nThe BOOST_FAULT bit can be cleared by host by reenabling boost mode\n9.3.8.2.3 Boost Mode Overvoltage Protection\nWhen the VBUS voltage rises above regulation target and exceeds VOTG_OVP, the device enters overvoltage \nprotection which stops switching, clears OTG_CONFIG bit and exits boost mode. At Boost overvoltage duration, \nthe fault register bit (BOOST_FAULT) is set high to indicate fault in boost operation. An INT is also asserted to \nthe host.\n9.3.8.3 Thermal Regulation and Thermal Shutdown\n9.3.8.3.1 Thermal Protection in Buck Mode\nThe BQ25601  monitors the internal junction temperature T J to avoid overheat of the chip and limits the IC \nsurface temperature in buck mode. When the internal junction temperature exceeds thermal regulation limit \n(110°C), the device lowers down the charge current. During thermal regulation, the actual charging current is \nusually below the programmed battery charging current. Therefore, termination is disabled, the safety timer runs \nat half the clock rate , and the status register THERM_STAT bit goes high .\nAdditionally, the device has thermal shutdown to turn off the converter and BATFET when IC surface \ntemperature exceeds T SHUT(160°C). The fault register CHRG_FAULT is set to 1 and an INT is asserted to \nthe host.  The BATFET and converter is enabled to recover when IC temperature is T SHUT_HYS  (30°C) below \nTSHUT(160°C).\n9.3.8.3.2 Thermal Protection in Boost Mode\nThe device monitors the internal junction temperature to provide thermal shutdown during boost mode. When IC \njunction temperature exceeds T SHUT (160°C), the boost mode is disabled by setting OTG_CONFIG bit low  and \nBATFET is turned off. When IC junction temperature is below T SHUT(160°C) - T SHUT_HYS  (30°C), the BATFET is \nenabled automatically to allow system to restore  and the host can re-enable OTG_CONFIG bit to recover .\n9.3.8.4 Battery Protection\n9.3.8.4.1 Battery Overvoltage Protection (BATOVP)\nThe battery overvoltage limit is clamped at 4% above the battery regulation voltage. When battery over voltage \noccurs, the charger device immediately disables charging. The fault register BAT_FAULT bit goes high and an \nINT is asserted to the host.\nwww.ti.comBQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\n9.3.8.4.2 Battery Overdischarge Protection\nWhen battery is discharged below V BAT_DPL_FALL , the BATFET is turned off to protect battery from overdischarge. \nTo recover from overdischarge latch-off, an input source plug-in is required at VBUS. The battery is charged with \nISHORT  (typically 100 mA) current when the V BAT < V SHORT , or precharge current as set in IPRECHG register \nwhen the battery voltage is between V SHORTZ  and V BAT_LOWV .\n9.3.8.4.3 System Overcurrent Protection\nWhen the system is shorted or significantly overloaded (I BAT > I BATOP ) and the current exceeds BATFET \novercurrent limit, the BATFET latches off. Section BATFET Enable (Exit Shipping Mode) can reset the latch-off \ncondition and turn on BATFET.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\n9.4.1 Narrow VDC Architecture\nThe device deploys Narrow VDC architecture (NVDC) with BATFET separating system from battery. The \nminimum system voltage is set by SYS_MIN bits. Even with a fully depleted battery, the system is regulated \nabove the minimum system voltage.\nWhen the battery is below minimum system voltage setting, the BATFET operates in linear mode (LDO mode), \nand the system is typically 180 mV above the minimum system voltage setting. As the battery voltage rises \nabove the minimum system voltage, BATFET is fully on and the voltage difference between the system and \nbattery is the V DS of BATFET.\nWhen the battery charging is disabled and above minimum system voltage setting or charging is terminated, the \nsystem is always regulated at typically 50 mV above battery voltage. The status register VSYS_STAT bit goes \nhigh when the system is in minimum system voltage regulation.\nBAT (V)System Voltage (V)\n2.7 2.9 3.1 3.3 3.5 3.7 3.9 4.1 4.33.33.43.53.63.73.83.944.14.24.34.4\nD002Minimum System Voltage\nSYS (Charge Disabled)\nSYS (Charge Enabled)\nFigure 9-7. System Voltage vs Battery Voltage\n9.4.2 Dynamic Power Management\nTo meet maximum current limit in USB spec and avoid over loading the adapter, the device features Dynamic \nPower management (DPM), which continuously monitors the input current and input voltage. When input source \nis over-loaded, either the current exceeds the input current limit (IINDPM) or the voltage falls below the input \nvoltage limit (VINDPM). The device then reduces the charge current until the input current falls below the input \ncurrent limit and the input voltage rises above the input voltage limit.\nWhen the charge current is reduced to zero, but the input source is still overloaded, the system voltage starts to \ndrop. Once the system voltage falls below the battery voltage, the device automatically enters the supplement \nmode where the BATFET turns on and battery starts discharging so that the system is supported from both the \ninput source and battery.BQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\nDuring DPM mode, the status register bits VDPM_STAT (VINDPM) or IDPM_STAT (IINDPM) goes high.

This prevents oscillation \nfrom entering and exiting the supplement mode.\nAs the discharge current increases, the BATFET gate is regulated with a higher voltage to reduce R DSON  until \nthe BATFET is in full conduction. At this point onwards, the BATFET V DS linearly increases with discharge \ncurrent. Figure 9-9  shows the V-I curve of the BATFET gate regulation operation.

When \nthe host set BATFET_DIS bit, the charger can turn off BATFET immediately or delay by t SM_DLY  as configured by \nBATFET_DLY bit.\n9.4.4.2 BATFET Enable (Exit Shipping Mode)\nWhen the BATFET is disabled (in shipping mode) and indicated by setting BATFET_DIS, one of the following \nevents can enable BATFET to restore system power:\n1.Plug in adapter\n2.Clear BATFET_DIS bit\n3.Set REG_RST bit to reset all registers including BATFET_DIS bit to default (0)\n4.A logic high to low transition on QON  pin with t SHIPMODE  deglitch time to enable BATFET to exit shipping \nmode\n9.4.4.3 BATFET Full System Reset\nThe BATFET functions as a load switch between battery and system when input source is not plugged in. By \nchanging the state of BATFET from on to off, systems connected to SYS can be effectively forced to have a \npower-on-reset. The QON  pin supports push-button interface to reset system power without host by changing \nthe state of BATFET.\nWhen the QON  pin is driven to logic low for t QON_RST  while input source is not plugged in and BATFET is \nenabled (BATFET_DIS = 0), the BATFET is turned off for t BATFET_RST  and then it is re-enabled to reset system \npower. This function can be disabled by setting BATFET_RST_EN bit to 0.\n9.4.4.4 QON  Pin Operations\nThe QON  pin incorporates two functions to control BATFET. QON  is pulled up to V QON by an internal 200-k Ω \npull-up resistor.\n1.BATFET Enable: A QON  logic transition from high to low with longer than t SHIPMODE  deglitch turns on \nBATFET to exit shipping mode. When exiting shipping mode, HIZ is enabled (EN_HIZ = 1) as well. HIZ can \nbe disabled (EN_HIZ = 0) by the host after exiting shipping mode. OTG cannot be enabled (OTG_CONFIG = \n1) until HIZ is disabled.\n2.BATFET Reset: When QON  is driven to logic low by at least t QON_RST  while adapter is not plugged in (and \nBATFET_DIS = 0), the BATFET is turned off for t BATFET_RST . The BATFET is re-enabled after t BATFET_RST \nduration. This function allows systems connected to SYS to have power-on-reset. This function can be \ndisabled by setting BATFET_RST_EN bit to 0.\nFigure 9-10  shows the sample external configurations for each.\nQON\nQ4  Status\nTurn on Q4 FET\nwhen BATFET_DIS = 1 or SLEEPZ = 1 Reset Q4 FET\nWhen BATFET_DIS = 0 and SLEEPZ = 0tSHIPMODEPress\npush buttonPress\npush button\n tQON_RST\n tBATFET_RST\nQ4\noff Q4 on  Q4 on  Q4 off due to I2C or\nsystem overload\nFigure 9-10.

I2C is a bi-directional 2-wire serial interface developed by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP \nSemiconductors). Only two bus lines are required: a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Devices \ncan be considered as hosts or targets when performing data transfers. A host is the device which initiates a data \ntransfer on the bus and generates the clock signals to permit that transfer. At that time, any device addressed is \nconsidered a target.\nThe device operates as a target device with address 6BH, receiving control inputs from the host device like \na microcontroller or a digital signal processor through REG00-REG0B. A register read beyond REG0B (0x0B) \nreturns 0xFF. The I2C interface supports both standard mode (up to 100 kbits), and fast mode (up to 400 kbits), \nconnecting to the positive supply voltage via a current source or pull-up resistor. When the bus is free, both lines \nare HIGH. The SDA and SCL pins are open drain.\n9.5.1.1 Data Validity\nThe data on the SDA line must be stable during the HIGH period of the clock. The HIGH or LOW state of the \ndata line can only change when the clock signal on the SCL line is LOW. One clock pulse is generated for each \ndata bit transferred.\nSDA\nSCL\nData line stable; \nData validChange of data \nallowed\nFigure 9-12. Bit Transfer on the I2C Bus\n9.5.1.2 START and STOP Conditions\nAll transactions begin with a START (S) and can be terminated by a STOP (P). A HIGH to LOW transition on \nthe SDA line while SCl is HIGH defines a START condition. A LOW to HIGH transition on the SDA line when \nthe SCL is HIGH defines a STOP condition. START and STOP conditions are always generated by the host. The \nbus is considered busy after the START condition, and free after the STOP condition.\nSDA\nSCLSDA\nSCL\nSTART (S) STOP (P)\nFigure 9-13. TS START and STOP conditions\n9.5.1.3 Byte Format\nEvery byte on the SDA line must be 8 bits long. The number of bytes to be transmitted per transfer is \nunrestricted. Each byte has to be followed by an Acknowledge bit. Data is transferred with the Most Significant BQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\nBit (MSB) first. If a target cannot receive or transmit another complete byte of data until it has performed some \nother function, it can hold the clock line SCL low to force the host into a wait state (clock stretching). Data \ntransfer then continues when the target is ready for another byte of data and release the clock line SCL.\nSCLSDA\nSTART or \nRepeated \nSTARTS or Sr1 2 7 8 9MSB\nACKAcknowledgement \nsignal from target\n1 2 8 9\nACKAcknowledgement \nsignal from host\nSTOP or \nRepeate\nd STARTP or Sr\nFigure 9-14. Data Transfer on the I2C Bus\n9.5.1.4 Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NACK)\nThe acknowledge takes place after every byte. The acknowledge bit allows the receiver to signal the transmitter \nthat the byte was successfully received and another byte may be sent. All clock pulses, including the \nacknowledge ninth clock pulse, are generated by the host. The transmitter releases the SDA line during the \nacknowledge clock pulse so the receiver can pull the SDA line LOW and it remains stable LOW during the HIGH \nperiod of this clock pulse.\nWhen SDA remains HIGH during the ninth clock pulse, this is the Not Acknowledge signal. The host can then \ngenerate either a STOP to abort the transfer or a repeated START to start a new transfer.\n9.5.1.5 Target Address and Data Direction Bit\nAfter the START, a target address is sent. This address is 7 bits long followed by the eighth bit as a data \ndirection bit (bit R/W). A zero indicates a transmission (WRITE) and a one indicates a request for data (READ).\nSCLSDA\nSTARTS\nACK ACK STOPP\nADDRESS DATA ACK DATA8 1 - 7\nR / W9 1-7 8 9 8 1-7 9\nFigure 9-15.

It keeps all the fault information from last read until the host issues a new read. For \nexample, if Charge Safety Timer Expiration fault occurs but recovers later, the fault register REG09 reports the \nfault when it is read the first time, but returns to normal when it is read the second time. in order to get the \nfault information at present, the host has to read REG09 for the second time. The only exception is NTC_FAULT \nwhich always reports the actual condition on the TS pin. in addition, REG09 does not support multi-read and \nmulti-write.BQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n32 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\n9.6 Register Maps\nI2C Target Address: 6BH\n9.6.1 REG00\nTable 9-5.

If the converter does not \noperate at 50% duty cycle, then the worst case capacitor RMS current I Cin occurs where the duty cycle is closest \nto 50% and can be estimated using Equation 5 .\nCIN CHGI I D (1 D)/c61 /c180 /c180 /c45\n(5)\nLow ESR ceramic capacitor such as X7R or X5R is preferred for input decoupling capacitor and should be \nplaced to the drain of the high-side MOSFET and source of the low-side MOSFET as close as possible. Voltage \nrating of the capacitor must be higher than normal input voltage level. A rating of 25 V or higher capacitor is \npreferred for 15-V input voltage. Capacitance of 22 μF is suggested for typical of 3-A charging current.\n10.2.2.3 Output Capacitor\nEnsure that the output capacitance has enough ripple current rating to absorb the output switching ripple current. \nEquation 6  shows the output capacitor RMS current I COUT  calculation.\nRIPPLE\nCOUT RIPPLEII 0.29 I\n2 3/c61 /c187 /c180\n/c180\n(6)\nThe output capacitor voltage ripple can be calculated as follows:\nOUT OUT\nO 2INV VV 1V 8LCfs/c230 /c246/c68 /c61 /c45 /c231 /c247\n/c232 /c248\n(7)\nAt certain input and output voltage and switching frequency, the voltage ripple can be reduced by increasing the \noutput filter LC.\nThe charger device has internal loop compensation optimized for ≤20-μF ceramic output capacitance. The \npreferred ceramic capacitor is 10-V rating, X7R or X5R.BQ25601\nSLUSCK5A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED MARCH 2023\n www.ti.com\n46 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ25601\n10.2.3 Application Curves\nVVBUS = 5 V VVBAT = 3.2 V\nFigure 10-2.

Proper layout of the \ncomponents to minimize high frequency current path loop (see Figure 12-1 ) is important to prevent electrical and \nmagnetic field radiation and high frequency resonant problems. Follow this specific order carefully to achieve the \nproper layout.\n1.Place input capacitor as close as possible to PMID pin and GND pin connections and use shortest copper \ntrace connection or GND plane.\n2.Place inductor input pin to SW pin as close as possible. Minimize the copper area of this trace to lower \nelectrical and magnetic field radiation but make the trace wide enough to carry the charging current. Do not \nuse multiple layers in parallel for this connection. Minimize parasitic capacitance from this area to any other \ntrace or plane.\n3.Put output capacitor near to the inductor and the device. Ground connections need to be tied to the IC \nground with a short copper trace connection or GND plane.\n4.Route analog ground separately from power ground. Connect analog ground and connect power ground \nseparately. Connect analog ground and power ground together using thermal pad as the single ground \nconnection point. Or using a 0-Ω resistor to tie analog ground to power ground.\n5.Use single ground connection to tie charger power ground to charger analog ground. Just beneath the \ndevice. Use ground copper pour but avoid power pins to reduce inductive and capacitive noise coupling.\n6.Place decoupling capacitors next to the IC pins and make trace connection as short as possible.\n7.It is critical that the exposed thermal pad on the backside of the device package be soldered to the PCB \nground. Ensure that there are sufficient thermal vias directly under the IC, connecting to the ground plane on \nthe other layers.\n8.Ensure that the number and sizes of vias allow enough copper for a given current path.\nRefer to the BQ25601 and BQ25601D (PWR877) Evaluation Module User\'s Guide  for the recommended \ncomponent placement with trace and via locations.
