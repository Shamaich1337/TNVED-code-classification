General description\nThe 74LVC1G18 is a 1-to-2 demultiplexer with 3-state outputs. The device buffers the data on input\nA and passes it to output 1Y or 2Y, depending on whether the state of the select input (S) is LOW\nor HIGH. The unused output assumes the high impedence OFF-state. Inputs can be driven from\neither 3.3 V or 5 V devices. This feature allows the use of these devices as translators in mixed\n3.3 V and 5 V environments.\nSchmitt-trigger action at all inputs makes the circuit tolerant of slower input rise and fall times.\nThis device is fully specified for partial power down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing the potentially damaging backflow current through the device when\nit is powered down.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n•Overvoltage tolerant inputs to 5.5 V\n•High noise immunity\n•±24 mA output drive (V CC = 3.0 V)\n•CMOS low power dissipation\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 250 mA\n•Direct interface with TTL levels\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial Power-down mode operation\n•Complies with JEDEC standard:\n•JESD8-7 (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n•JESD8-5 (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•JESD36 (4.5 V to 5.5 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-001 class 2 exceeds 2000 V\n•CDM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-002 class C3 exceeds 1000 V\n•Specified from -40 to +85 °C and -40 to +125 °C.\n3.

### Component Summary: 74LVC1G18GW

**General Description:**
The 74LVC1G18 is a 1-to-2 non-inverting demultiplexer with 3-state outputs. It allows data from a single input (A) to be routed to one of two outputs (1Y or 2Y) based on the state of a select input (S). The unused output is in a high-impedance state. This device is suitable for use in mixed voltage environments (3.3 V and 5 V) and features Schmitt-trigger inputs for improved noise immunity.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VCC): 1.65 V to 5.5 V
  - Input Voltage: -0.5 V to 6.5 V
  - Output Voltage: -0.5 V to VCC + 0.5 V (active mode)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Output Drive Current: ±24 mA (at VCC = 3.0 V)
  - Input Clamping Current: -50 mA (for VI < 0 V)
  - Output Clamping Current: ±50 mA (for VO > VCC or VO < 0 V)
  
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Supply Current (ICC): 100 mA (max)
  - Power Dissipation (Ptot): 250 mW (max)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to +125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - TSSOP6 (74LVC1G18GW) or SC-74 (TSOP6) (74LVC1G18GV)

- **Special Features:**
  - Schmitt-trigger inputs for slow input rise/fall time tolerance
  - I_OFF circuitry for partial power-down mode
  - Overvoltage tolerant inputs (up to 5.5 V)
  - ESD protection: HBM > 2000 V, CDM > 1000 V
  - Complies with JEDEC standards for various voltage ranges

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Description:**
The 74LVC1G18 is a CMOS-based demultiplexer that can route a single data input to one of two outputs based on a select signal. It is designed for low power consumption and high noise immunity, making it suitable for applications requiring reliable signal routing in mixed voltage environments.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Data Routing:** Used in digital circuits to direct data signals to different paths based on control signals.
- **Signal Processing:** Can be utilized in applications where signal selection is necessary, such as multiplexing and demultiplexing.
- **Level Shifting:** Acts as a translator between 3.3 V and 5 V logic levels, facilitating communication between devices operating at different voltage levels.
- **Power Management:** Useful in systems that require power-down features to conserve energy when certain outputs are not in use.

This component is ideal for applications in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and any digital systems requiring efficient data management and routing.
