The S29GL064S is a 64-Mb device organized as 4,194,304 words or 8,388,608 bytes. \nDepending on the model number, the devices have 16-bit wide data bus only, or a 16-bit wide data bus that can also function as an 8-bit wide data bus by using the BYTE# input. The devices can be programmed either in the host system or in standard EPROM programmers.\nAccess times as fast as 70 ns are available. Note that each access time has a specific operating voltage range (V\nCC) \nas specified in the “Product selector guide” on page 6 and “Ordering information” on page 111. Package \nofferings include 48-pin TSOP , 56-pin TSOP , 48-ball fine-p itch BGA, and 64-ball fortified BGA, depending on model \nnumber. Each device has separate chip enable (CE#), write enable (WE#) and output enable (OE#) controls.\nEach device requires only a single 3.0-V power supply  for both read and write functions. In addition to a VCC \ninput, a high-voltage accelerated program (ACC)  feature is supported through increased voltage on the \nWP#/ACC or ACC input. This feature is in tended to facilitate system production. \nThe device is entirely command set compatible with the JEDEC single-power-supply flash standard . \nCommands are written to the device using standard micr oprocessor write timing. Writ e cycles also internally \nlatch addresses and data needed for the programming and erase operations.\nThe sector erase architecture  allows memory sectors to be erased and reprogrammed without affecting the \ndata contents of other sectors. The device is  fully erased when shipped from the factory.\nThe advanced sector protection  features several levels of sector pr otection, which can disable both the \nprogram and erase operations in certain sectors. Persiste nt sector protection is a method that replaces the \nprevious 12-V controlled protection method. Password sector protection is a highly sophisticated protection method that requires a password before changes to certain sectors are permitted.\nDevice programming and erasure are initiated through command sequences. Once a program or erase operation \nbegins, the host system need only poll the DQ7 (Data# Polling) or DQ6 (toggle) status bits or monitor the \nReady/Busy# (RY/BY#)  output to determine whether the operation is  complete. To facilitate programming, an \nUnlock Bypass  mode reduces command sequence overhead by re quiring only two write cycles to program data \ninstead of four.\nDatasheet 3 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nGeneral description\nHardware data protection  measures include a low VCC detector that automatically inhibits write operations \nduring power transitions. The hardware sector protection  feature disables both pr ogram and erase operations \nin any combination of sectors of memory. This can be achieved in-system or via programming equipment.\nThe Erase Suspend / Erase Resume feature allows the host system to paus e an erase operation in a given sector \nto read or program any other sector and then complete the erase operation. The Program Suspend / Program \nResume  feature enables the host system to pause a program op eration in a given sector to read any other sector \nand then complete the program operation.\nThe hardware RESET# pin  terminates any operation in progress and resets the device, after which it is then ready \nfor a new operation. The RESET# pin may be tied to the system reset circuitry. A system reset would thus also \nreset the device, enabling the host system to read boot-up firmware from the flash memory device.\nThe device reduces power consumption in the standby mode  when it detects specific voltage levels on CE# and \nRESET#, or when addresses are stable for a specified period of time.\nThe Write Protect (WP#)  feature protects the first or last sector by  asserting a logic low on the WP#/ACC pin or \nWP# pin, depending on model number. The protected sector is still protected even during accelerated \nprogramming.\nThe Secure Silicon Region  provides a 128-word / 256-byte area for code or data that can be permanently \nprotected. Once this sector is protected, no  further changes within the sector can occur.\nMIRRORBIT™ flash technology combines years of flash me mory manufacturing experience to produce the highest \nlevels of quality, reliability and cost effectiveness. Th e device electrically erases  all bits within a sector \nsimultaneously via hot-hole assist ed erase. The data is programmed using hot electron injection.\nDatasheet 4 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nTable of contents\nTable of contents\nDistinctive

The command register itself does not occupy any addressable memory location. The \nregister is a latch used to store th e commands, along with the address and data information needed to execute \nthe command. The contents of the register serve as in puts to the internal state machine. The state machine \noutputs dictate the function of the device. Table 4  lists the device bus operations, the inputs and control levels \nthey require, and the resulting output . The following subsections describe ea ch of these operations in further \ndetail.\nLegend:\nL = Logic LOW = VIL\nH = Logic HIGH = VIH\nVHH = Voltage for ACC program acceleration\nVID = Voltage for autoselect\nX = Don’t careA\nIN = Address in\nDIN = Data in\nDOUT = Data outTable 4 Device bus operations\nOperation CE# OE# WE# RESET# BYTE#[6]WP# ACC Addresses DQ0–DQ7DQ8–DQ15\nBYTE# = VIHBYTE# = VIL\nRead L L H H L or H X X AIN DOUT DOUT\nDQ8–DQ14 \n= High-Z, \nDQ15 = A1Autoselect \n(HV)LL HHL  o r  H X H AIN [7]DOUT DOUT\nWrite \n(Program / \nErase)LH L H L  o r  H N o t e  8 X AIN Note 9 Note 9\nAccelerated \nProgramLH L H L  o r  H N o t e  8 VHH AIN Note 9 Note 9\nStandby VIO + 0.3 V X X VIO + 0.3 V L or H X H X High-Z High-Z High-Z\nOutput \nDisableLH H\nH L or H X X X High-Z High-Z High-Z\nHX X\nReset X X X L L or H X X X High-Z High-Z High-Z\nNotes\n6.

If WP# = VIL, the first or last sector remains protected (for  uniform sector devices), and the two outer boot \nsectors are protected (for boot sector devices). If WP# = V\nIH, the first or last sector, or the two outer boot sectors are protected or unprotected as determined \nby the method described in write pr otect (WP#). All sectors are unprotected when shipped from the factory \n(The secure silicon region may be factory protected depending on version ordered.)\n9.

If the BYTE# \npin is set at logic 1, the device is in word configuratio n, DQ0–DQ15 are active and controlled by CE#, WE# and OE#.\nIf the BYTE# pin is set at logic 0, the device is in byte  configuration, and only data I/O pins DQ0–DQ7 are active \nand controlled by CE#, WE# and OE#. The data I/O pins DQ8–DQ14 are tri-stated, and the DQ15 pin is used as an \ninput for the LSB (A1) address function.\nThe BYTE# pin must be driven set to a logic 0 or 1 state prior to CE# being driven LO W. The BYTE# pin should not \nchange logic state while CE# is LOW.\n6.2 Requirements for reading array data\nAll memories require access time to output array data. In a read operation, data is read from one memory location at a time. Addresses are presented to the device in random order, and the propagation delay through the device causes the data on its outputs to arrive with the address on its inputs.\nThe device defaults to reading array data after device power-up or hardware reset. To read data from the memory \narray, the system must first assert a valid addr ess on Amax–A0, while driving OE# and CE# to V\nIL. WE# must remain \nat VIH. Data will appear on DQ15–DQ0 after address access time (tACC), which is equal to the delay from stable \naddresses to valid output data. The OE# signal must be driven to VIL. Data is output on DQ15–DQ0 pins after the \naccess time (tOE) has elapsed from the falling edge of OE#.\nSee “Reading array data” on page 33 for more information. Refer to Table 72  and Table 73  for timing \nspecifications and the timing diagram. Refer to Table 63  and Table 64  for the active current specification on \nreading array data.\n6.2.1 Page mode read\nThe device is capable of fast page mode read and is co mpatible with the page mode Mask ROM read operation. \nThis mode provides faster read access speed for random locations within a page. The page size of the device is 8 words / 16 bytes. The appropriate page is selected by th e higher address bits A(max)–A3. Address bits A2–A0 in \nword mode (A2–A1 in byte mode) determine the specific wo rd within a page. This is an asynchronous operation; \nthe microprocessor supplies the specific word location.\nThe random or initial page access is equal to t\nACC or tCE and subsequent page read  accesses (as long as the \nlocations specified by the microprocessor fa lls within that page) is equivalent to tPACC . When CE# is deasserted \nand reasserted for a subsequent access, the access time is tACC or tCE. Fast page mode accesses are obtained by \nkeeping the read-page addresses constant and changing the intra-read  page addresses.\n6.3 Writing commands / command sequences\nTo write a command or command sequence (which includes  programming data to the device and erasing sectors \nof memory), the system must drive WE# and CE# to VIL, and OE# to VIH.\nThe device features an Unlock Bypass  mode to facilitate faster programming. Once the device enters the Unlock \nBypass mode, only two write cycl es are required to program a word, instead of four. The Table 19  contains details \non programming data to the device using both standard and Unlock Bypass command sequences.\nAn erase operation can erase one sector, multiple sectors, or the entire device. Table 5 –Table 8  indicate the \naddress space that each sector occupies.\nRefer to “DC characteristics” on page 83  for the active current specification for the write mode. The “AC \ncharacteristics” on page 90 section contains timing specification tables and timing diagrams for write \noperations.\n6.3.1 Write buffer\nWrite Buffer programming allows the system write to  a maximum of 128 words / 256 bytes in one programming \noperation. This results in faster effective programm ing time than the standard  programming algorithms. \nDatasheet 16 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nDevice bus operations\n6.3.2 Accelerated program operation\nThe device offers program operations through the ACC fu nction. This is one of two functions provided by the \nWP#/ACC or ACC pin, depending on model number. This fu nction is primarily intended to support manufacturing \nprogramming operations at the factory. \nIf the system asserts VHH on this pin, the device automatically enters the Unlock Bypass mode, protected sectors \nwill remain protected. The system would use a two-cycl e program command sequence as required by the Unlock \nBypass mode. Removing VHH from the WP#/ACC or ACC pin, depending on model number, returns the device to \nnormal operation. Note that the WP#/ACC or ACC pin must be raised to VHH prior to any accelerated operation \nand should return to VIL/VIH after the completion of the accelerated operation. It should not be at VHH for \noperations other than accelerated programming, or device damage may result. WP# contains an internal pull-up; when unconnected, WP# is at V\nIH.\n6.3.3 Autoselect functions\nIf the system writes the autoselect command sequence, the device enters the autoselect mode. The system can \nthen read autoselect codes from the internal register (w hich is separate from the memory array) on DQ7–DQ0. \nStandard read cycle timings (tACC) apply in this mode. Refer to “Autoselect mode” on page 20 and “Autoselect \ncommand sequence” on page 34 for more information.\n6.4 Automatic ECC\n6.4.1 ECC overview\nThe automatic ECC feature works transparently with normal  program, erase, and read operations. As the device \ntransfers each page of data from the Write Buffer to th e memory array, internal ECC logic programs the ECC code \nfor that page into a portion of the memory array that is  not visible to the host system. The device evaluates the \npage data and the ECC code during each initial page acce ss. If needed, the internal ECC logic will correct a single \nbit error during the initial access.\nProgramming more than once to a particular page will disable the ECC function for that page. The ECC function \nfor that page will remain disabled until the next time the host system erases the sector containing that page. The \nhost system may read data stored in that page fo llowing multiple programming operations; however, ECC \nremains disables and the device will not detect or correct an error in that page.\n6.4.2 Program and erase summary\nFor performance and reliability reasons, the device pe rforms reading and programming operations on full \n32-byte pages in parallel. Internal device logic provides ECC on each page by adding an ECC code when the page \nis first programmed.\n6.4.3 ECC implementation\nEach 32-byte page in the main flash array, as well as each 32-byte OTP region, features an associated ECC code. \nInternal ECC logic is able to detect and correct any sing le bit error found in a page or the associated ECC code \nduring a read access. The first Write Buffer program operation applied to a page programs the ECC code for that page. Subsequent programming operations  that occur more than once on a particular page will disable the ECC \nfunction for that page. This allows bit or word progra mming; however, multiple pr ogramming operations to the \nsame page will disable the ECC function on the page where incremental programming occurs. An erase of the \nsector containing the page with ECC disabled will re-enable the ECC function for that page.\nThe ECC function is automatic and transparent to the user. The transparency of the automatic ECC function \nenhances data integrity for typical programming operations  that write data once to each page. The ECC function \nalso facilitates software compatibility to previous genera tions of GL family products  by allowing single word \nprogramming and bit-walking where the user programs the same page or word more than once. When a page has \nautomatic ECC disabled, the ECC function will not detect or correct any errors upon a data read from that page.\nDatasheet 17 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nDevice bus operations\n6.4.4 Word programming\nA word programming operation programs a single word  anywhere in the main memory array. Programming \nmultiple words within the same 32-byte page disables th e automatic ECC function for that page. An erase of the \nsector containing that page will re-enable automatic ECC following multiple word programming operation on \nthat page.\n6.4.5 Write buffer programming\nEach Write Buffer program operation allows the user to pr ogram a single bit up to 256 bytes. A 32-byte page is the \nsmallest program granularity that features automatic EC C protection. Programming to the same page more than \nonce will disable the automatic ECC function for that page. Infineon recommends the use of a Write Buffer \nprogramming operation to program multiple pages in an op eration and to write each page only once. This keeps \nthe automatic ECC function enabled on each page. For th e very best performance, program in full lines of \n256 bytes aligned on 256-byte boundaries.\n6.5 Standby mode\nWhen the system is not reading or writin g to the device, it can be placed in to standby mode. In this mode, current \nconsumption is greatly reduced, and the outputs are placed  in the high impedance state, independent of the OE# \ninput. \nThe device enters the CMOS standby mode when the CE# and RESET# pins are both held at VIO ± 0.3 V. (Note that \nthis is a more restricted voltage range than VIH.) If CE# and RESET# are held at VIH, but not within VIO ± 0.3 V, the \ndevice is in the standby mode, but the standby current is greater. The device requires standard access time (t\nACC/tCE) for read access when the device is in either of th ese standby modes, before it is ready to read data.\nIf the device is deselected during erasure or programming,  the device draws active current until the operation is \ncompleted.\nRefer to the “DC characteristics” on page 83, for the standby current specification. \n6.6 Automatic sleep mode\nThe automatic sleep mode reduces device interface energy consumption to the sleep level (ICC6) following the \ncompletion of a random read access time. The device au tomatically enables this mo de when addresses remain \nstable for tACC + 30 ns. While in sleep mode, output data is latched and always available to the system. Output of \nthe data depends on the level of the OE# signal but, th e automatic sleep mode curren t is independent of the OE# \nsignal level. Standard address access timings (tACC or tPACC ) provide new data when addresses are changed. Refer \nto the “DC characteristics” on page 83 for the automatic sleep mode current specification ICC6.\nAutomatic sleep helps reduce current consumption especi ally when the host system clock is slowed for power \nreduction. During slow system clock periods, read and wr ite cycles may extend many times their length versus \nwhen the system is operating at high speed. Even though CE# may be LOW throughout these extended data transfer cycles, the memory device host interfac e will go to the Automatic Sleep current at t\nACC +3 0n s .  T h e  d e v i c e  \nwill remain at the Automatic Sleep current for tASSB . Then the device will transition to the standby current level. \nThis keeps the memory at the Automatic Sleep or standby po wer level for most of the long duration data transfer \ncycles, rather than consuming full read power all the time that the memory device is selected by the host system.\nHowever, the EAC operates independent of the automatic sleep mode of the host interface and will continue to \ndraw current during an active EA. Only when both the ho st interface and EAC are in their standby states is the \nstandby level current achieved.\nDatasheet 18 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nDevice bus operations\n6.7 RESET#: Hardware reset pin\nThe RESET# pin provides a hardware method of resetting the device to reading array data. When the RESET# pin \nis driven LOW for at least a period of tRP, the device immediately terminates any operation in progress, output \npins go to High-Z, and all read / write commands are ignored for the duration of the RESET# pulse. Program / \nErase operations that were interrupt ed should be reinitiated once the device is ready to accept another \ncommand sequence, to ensure data integrity.\nCurrent is reduced for the duration of the RESET# pulse. When RESET# is held at VSS ± 0.3 V long enough, the \ndevice draws CMOS standby current (ICC5). \nThe RESET# pin may be tied to the system reset circuitry.  A system reset would thus also reset the flash memory, \nenabling the system to read the boot -up firmware from the flash memory.\nRefer to the “AC characteristics” on page 90 for RESET# parameters and to Figure 22  for the timing diagram.\n6.8 Output disable mode\nWhen the OE# input is at VIH, output from the device is disabled.

This mode  is primarily intended fo r programming equipment to \nautomatically match a device to be programmed with it s corresponding programming algorithm. However, the \nautoselect codes can also be accessed in-system through the command register. \nWhen using programming equipment, the autoselect mode requires VID on address pin A9. Address pins A6, A3, \nA2, A1, and A0 must be as shown in Table 9 . In addition, when verifying sector protection, the sector address must \nappear on the appropriate hi ghest order address bits (see Table 5 –Table 8 ). Table 9  shows the remaining \naddress bits that are don’t care. When all necessary bits are set as required, the programming equipment may then read the corresponding identifier code on DQ 7–DQ0. Note that the A9 pin must not be at V\nID for operations \nother than autoselect, or device da mage may result. Autoselect using VID is supported at room temperature only. \nIt must be raised to VID prior to any autoselect operations and should return to VIL/VIH after the completion of the \nautoselect operation. It should not be at VID for operations other than autoselect, or device damage may result.\nTo access the autoselect codes in-system, the host sy stem can issue the autosele ct command via the command \nregister, as shown in Table 23  and Table 25 . This method does not require VID. Refer to the “Autoselect \ncommand sequence” on page 34 for more information.\nID-CFI location 02h displays sector protection status for th e sector selected by the sector address (SA) used in the \nID-CFI enter command. To read the protection status of mo re than one sector it is necessary to exit the ID ASO \nand enter the ID ASO using the new SA. The access time to read location 02h is always tACC and a read of this \nlocation requires CE# to go HIGH before the read and return LOW to initiate the read (asynchronous read access).

The user must then  choose if the Persistent \nor Password Protection method is most desirable. Ther e are two one-time programmable non-volatile bits that \ndefine which sector protection method is used. If the user decides to continue using the Persistent Sector Protection method, they must set the Persistent Sector Protection Mode Locking Bit.  This permanently sets the \npart to operate only using Persistent Sector Protection . If the user decides to use the password method, they \nmust set the Password Mode Locking Bit. This permanently sets the part to operate only using password sector protection.\nIt is important to remember that setting either the Persis tent Sector Protection Mode Locking Bit or the Password \nMode Locking Bit permanently selects the protection mode. It is not possible to switch between the two methods \nonce a locking bit is set. It is important that one mode is explicit ly selected when the device is first \nprogrammed, rather than relyin g on the default mode alone. This is so that it is not possible for a system \nprogram or virus to later set the Password Mode Locking Bit, which would cause an unexpected shift from the default Persistent Sector Protection Mode into the Password Protection Mode. \nThe device is shipped with all sectors unprotected. Infi neon offers the option of programming and protecting \nsectors at the factory prior to shipping the device through the ExpressFlash™ Se rvice. Contact your sales \nrepresentative for details.\nIt is possible to determine whether a sector is protected or unprotected. See “Autoselect command sequence” \non page 34 for details.\n6.12 Lock Register\nThe Lock Register consists of 3 bits (DQ2, DQ1, and DQ 0). These DQ2, DQ1, DQ0 bits of the Lock Register are \nprogrammable by the user. Users are not allowed to progra m both DQ2 and DQ1 bits of the Lock Register to the \n00 state. If the user tries to program DQ2 and DQ1 bits of the Lock Register to the 00 state, the device aborts the \nLock Register back to the default 11 state. Once either  DQ2 and DQ1 bits of the Lock Register are programmed \nthan no further changes are allow on DQ2 and DQ1. The pr ogramming time of the Lock Register is same as the \ntypical word programming time (tWHWH1 ) without utilizing the Write Buffer of  the device. During a Lock Register \nprogramming sequence execution, the DQ6 Toggle Bit I to ggles until the programming of the Lock Register has \ncompleted to indicate programming status. All Lock Register bits are readable to allow users to verify Lock Register statuses.\nThe customer secure silicon region protection bit is DQ0, persistent protection mode lock bit is DQ1, and \npassword protection mode lock bit is DQ2 are accessible  by all users. Each of these bits are non-volatile. \nDQ15–DQ3 are reserved and must be 1’s when the user tries to program the DQ 2, DQ1, and DQ0 bits of the Lock \nRegister. The user is not required to program DQ2, DQ1 an d DQ0 bits of the Lock Register at the same time. This \nallows users to lock the secure silicon region and th en set the device either permanently into password \nprotection mode or persistent protection mode and then lock the secure silicon region at separate instances and time frames.\n• Secure silicon region protection allows the user to lock the secure silicon region area.• Persistent protection mode lock bit allows the user to set the device permanently to operate in the persistent \nprotection mode.\n• Password protection mode lock bit allows the user to  set the device permanently to operate in the password \nprotection mode.\nTable 10 Lock register\nBit DQ15–DQ6 DQ5 DQ4 DQ3 DQ2 DQ1 DQ0\nName Don’t care Reserved Reserved ReservedPassword \nprotection \nmode lock bitPersistent \nprotection \nmode lock bitSecure silicon \nregion \nprotection bit\nDefault \nvalue1111110\nDatasheet 23 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nDevice bus operations\n6.13 Persistent sector protection\nThe persistent sector protection method replaces the ol d 12 V controlled protection method while at the same \ntime enhancing flexibility by  providing three different sector protection states.\nTo achieve these states, thr ee types of “bits” are used:\n6.13.1 Dynamic protection bit (DYB)\nA volatile protection bit is assigned for each sector. After power-up or hardware reset, the contents of all DYB bits \nare in the “unprotected state” . Each DYB is individuall y modifiable through the DYB Set command and DYB Clear \ncommand. The DYB bits and persistent protect bits (PPB) lock bit are defaulted to power-up in the cleared state or unprotected state - meaning the all PPB bits are changeable. \nThe protection state for each sector is determined by the logical OR of the PPB and the DYB related to that sector. \nFor the sectors that have the PPB bits cleared, the DYB bits control whether or not the sector is protected or \nunprotected. By issuing the DYB Set and DYB Clear command sequences, the DYB bits is protected or unprotected, thus placing each sector in the protected or unprotected state. These are the so-called dynamic locked or unlocked states. They are called dynamic states  because it is very easy to switch back and forth \nbetween the protected and un-protected conditions. This  allows software to easily protect sectors against \ninadvertent changes yet does not prevent the easy removal of protection when changes are needed. \nThe DYB bits may be set or cleared as often as needed. The PPB bi ts allow for a more static, and difficult to change, \nlevel of protection. The PPB bits retain their state acro ss power cycles because they are non-volatile. Individual \nPPB bits are set with a program command but must all be cleared as a group through an erase command. \nThe PPB lock bit adds an additional level of protection. Once all PPB bits are programmed to the desired settings, \nthe PPB lock bit may be set to the ‘freeze state’ . Setting the PPB lock bit to the freeze state disables all program \nand erase commands to the non-volatile PPB bits. In effect , the PPB lock bit locks the PPB bits into their current \nstate. The only way to clear the PPB lock bit to the ‘unfr eeze state’ is to go through a power cycle, or hardware \nreset. The Software Reset command does not clear the PPB lock bit to the unfreeze state. System boot code can \ndetermine if any changes to the PPB bits are needed e.g ., to allow new system code to be downloaded. If no \nchanges are needed then the boot code can set the PPB lo ck bit to disable any further changes to the PPB bits \nduring system operation.\nThe WP# write protect pin adds a final level of hardware pr otection. When this pin is low it is not possible to \nchange the contents of the WP# protected sectors. Thes e sectors generally hold system boot code. So, the WP# \npin can prevent any changes to the boot code that could override the choices made while setting up sector protection during system initialization. \nIt is possible to have sectors that have been persistently  locked, and sectors that are left in the dynamic state. \nThe sectors in the dynamic state are all unprotected. If ther e is a need to protect some of them, a simple DYB Set \ncommand sequence is all that is necessary. The DYB Se t and DYB Clear commands for the dynamic sectors switch \nthe DYB bits to signify protected and unprotected, respecti vely. If there is a need to  change the status of the \npersistently locked sectors, a few more steps are required. First, the PPB lock bit must be disabled to the unfreeze \nstate by either putting the device through a power-cycle,  or hardware reset. The PPB bits can then be changed \nto reflect the desired settings. Setting the PPB lock bit once again to the freeze state locks the PPB bits, and the \ndevice operates normally again.\nTo achieve the best protection, execute the PPB Lock Bi t Set command early in the boot code, and protect the \nboot code by holding WP# = V\nIL.Dynamically locked The sector is protected and can be changed by a simple command.\nPersistently locked A sector is protected and cannot be changed.\nUnlocked The sector is unprotected and can be changed by a simple command.\nDatasheet 24 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nDevice bus operations\n6.13.2 Persistent protection bit (PPB)\nA single persistent (non-volatile) protection bit is assigned to each sector. If a PPB is programmed to the \nprotected state through the PPB Program command, that se ctor is protected from program or erase operations \nand is therefor read-only. If a PPB re quires erasure, all of th e sector PPB bits must first be erased in parallel \nthrough the All PPB Erase command. The All PPB Erase co mmand preprograms all PPB bits prior to PPB erasing. \nAll PPB bits erase in parallel, unlike programming where individual PPB bits are programmable. The PPB bits are \nlimited to the same number of cycles as a flash memory sector.\nProgramming the PPB bit requires the typical word progra mming time without utilizin g the write buffer. During \na PPB bit programming and all PPB bit erasing sequence  executions, the DQ6 Toggle Bit I toggles until the \nprogramming of the PPB bit or erasing of all PPB bits ha s completed to indicate programming and erasing status. \nErasing all of the PPB bits at once requires typical sect or erase time. During the eras ing of all PPB bits, the DQ3 \nsector erase timer bit outputs ‘1’ to indicate the erasure of  all PPB bits are in progress. Reading the PPB status bit \nrequires the initial access time of the device.\n6.13.3 Persistent protection bit lock (PPB lock bit)\nA global volatile bit. When set to the freeze state, the PPB bits cannot be changed. When cleared to the unfreeze \nstate, the PPB bits are changeable. There is only one PPB lock bit per device. The PPB lock bit is cleared to the \nunfreeze state at power-up or hardware reset.\nConfiguring the PPB lock bit to the fr eeze state requires approximately tWC. Reading the PPB lock status bit \nrequires the initial access time (tACC) of the device.\nTable 11  contains all possible combinations of the DYB bit, PPB  bit, and PPB lock bit relating to the status of the \nsector. In summary, if the PPB bit is set, and the PPB lock bit is set, the sector is protected and the protection \ncannot be removed until the next power cycle or hardware reset clears the PPB lock bit to unfreeze state. If the \nPPB bit is cleared, the sector can be dynamically locked  or unlocked. The DYB bit then controls whether or not \nthe sector is protected or unprotected. If the user attempts to program or erase a protected sector, the device ignores the command and returns to read mode. A program or erase command to a protected sector enables status polling for t\nDP before the device returns to read mode wi thout having modified the contents of the \nprotected sector. The programming of the DYB bit, PPB bit, and PPB lock bit for a given sector can be verified by \nwriting a DYB Status Read, PPB Status Read, and PPB Lock Status Read commands to the device.\nThe autoselect sector protection verification outputs the OR function of the DYB bit and PPB bit per sector basis. \nWhen the OR function of the DYB bit and PPB bit is ‘1’ , th e sector is either protected by DYB or PPB or both. When \nthe OR function of the DYB bit and PPB bit is ‘0’ , the sector is unprotected through both the DYB and PPB.

There are two main differences betw een the persistent sector protection and the password \nsector protection methods:\n• When the device is first powered on, or comes out of a rese t cycle, the PPB lock bit is set to the locked state, or \nthe freeze state, rather than cleared to the unlocked state, or the unfreeze state.\n• The only means to clear and unfreeze the PPB lock bit is by writing a unique 64-bit password to the device.\nThe password sector protection method is otherwise id entical to the persistent sector protection method.\nA 64-bit password is the only addition al tool utilized in this method.\nThe password is stored in a one-time programmable (OTP) region outside of the flash memory. Once the \npassword protection mode lock bit is set, the password is permanently set with no means to read, program, or \nerase it. The password is used to clear and unfreeze the PPB lock Bit. The Password Unlock command must be \nwritten to the flash, along with a password. The flash device internally compares the given password with the \npre-programmed password. If they match, the PPB lock bit is cleared to the unfreezed  state , and the PPB bits can \nbe altered. If they do not match, the flash device does nothing. There is a built-in tPPB delay for each password \ncheck after the valid 64-bit password is entered for the PPB lo ck bit to be cleared to the unfreezed state. This delay \nis intended to thwart any efforts to run a program that  tries all possible combinat ions in order to crack the \npassword.\n6.15 Password and password protection mode lock bit\nIn order to select the password sector protection meth od, the user must first program the password. Infineon \nrecommends that the password be somehow correlated to  the unique electronic serial number (ESN) of the \nparticular flash device. Each ESN is different for every fl ash device; therefore each password should be different \nfor every flash device. While programming in the passwo rd region, the customer may perform password read \noperations. Once the desired password is programmed in, the customer must then set the password protection \nmode lock bit. This operat ion achieves two objectives:\n1. It permanently sets the device to operate using the password protection mode. It is not possible to reverse this \nfunction.\n2. It also disables all further commands to the passwor d region. All program, and read operations are ignored.\nBoth of these objectives are important, and if not care fully considered, may lead to unrecoverable errors. The \nuser must be sure that the password sector protection method is desired when programming the password protection mode lock bit. More importantly, the user must be sure that the password is correct when the \npassword protection mode lock bit is programmed. Due to the fact that read operations are disabled, there is no \nmeans to read what the password is afterwards. If the password is lost after programming the password protection mode lock bit, there is no way to clear an d unfreeze the PPB lock bit. The password protection mode \nlock bit, once programmed, prevents reading the 64-bit password on the DQ bus and further password \nprogramming. The password protection mode lock bit is not erasable. Once password protection mode lock bit is programmed, the persistent protection mode lock bit is disabled from programming, guaranteeing that no \nchanges to the protection scheme are allowed.\n6.15.1 64-bit password\nThe 64-bit password is located in its own memory sp ace and is accessible through the use of the Password \nProgram and Password Read commands. The password function works in conjunction with the password protection mode lock bit, which when programmed, pr events the Password Read command from reading the \ncontents of the password on  the pins of the device.\nDatasheet 26 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nDevice bus operations\n6.16 Persistent protection bit lock (PPB lock bit) \nA global volatile bit. The PPB lock bit is a volatile bit that reflects the state of the password protection mode lock \nbit after power-up reset. If the password protection mo de lock bit is also programmed after programming the \npassword, the Password Unlock command must be issued to clear and unfreeze the PPB lock bit after a hardware reset (RESET# asserted) or a power-up reset. Successful execution of the Password Unlock command clears and \nunfreezes the PPB lock bit, allowing for sector PPB bits  to be modified. Without is suing the Password Unlock \ncommand, while asserting RESET#, taking the device throug h a power-on reset, or issuing the PPB Lock Bit Set \ncommand sets the PPB lock bit to a the freeze state.\nIf the password protection mode lock bit is not programm ed, the device defaults to persistent protection mode. \nIn the persistent protection mode, the PPB lock bit is cleared to the  unfreeze  state  after power-up or hardware \nreset. The PPB lock bit is set to the freeze state by issuing the PPB Lock Bit Set command. Once set to the  freeze  \nstate the only means for clearing the PPB lock bit to the unfreeze state is by issuing a hardware or power-up reset. \nThe Password Unlock command is ignored in persistent protection mode.\nReading the PPB lock bit requir es the initial access time (t\nACC) of the device. \n6.17 Secure silicon region flash memory\nThe secure silicon region feature provides a flash memo ry region that enables permanent part identification \nthrough an electronic serial number (ESN). The secure silicon region is 256 bytes in length, and uses a secure \nsilicon region indicator bit (DQ7) in autoselect mode to indicate whether or not the secure silicon region is locked when shipped from the factory. This bit is permanently se t at the factory and cannot be changed, which prevents \ncloning of a factory locked part. This ensures the security  of the ESN once the produc t is shipped to the field. \nThe factory offers the device with the secure silicon regi on either customer lockable (standard shipping option) \nor factory locked (contact a sales representative for ordering information). The customer-lockable version is \nshipped with the secure silicon region unprotected, allo wing customers to program the sector after receiving the \ndevice. The customer-lockable version a lso has the secure silicon region Indicator bit permanently set to ‘0’ . The \nfactory-locked version is always protected when shippe d from the factory, and has the secure silicon region \nindicator bit permanently set to ‘1’ . Thus, the secure silicon region indicator bit prevents customer-lockable \ndevices from being used to replace devices that are factory locked.\nThe secure silicon region address space in this device is allocated as follows:\nThe system accesses the secure silicon region through a command sequence (see Table 23  and Table 25 ). After \nthe system has written the Enter Secure Silicon Region co mmand sequence, it may read the secure silicon region \nby using the addresses normally occupi ed by the first sector (SA0). This mode of operation continues until the \nsystem issues the Exit Secure Silicon Region command sequence, Reset / ASO Exit command, or until power is \nremoved from the device. On power-up, or following a hardware reset, the device reverts to sending commands to sector SA0.Table 12 Secure silicon region address space allocation\nSecure silicon region \naddress rangeCustomer lockable ESN factory lockedExpress flash\nfactory locked\n000000h–000007hDetermined by customerESNESN or determined by \ncustomer\n000008h–00007Fh Unavailable Determined by customer\nDatasheet 27 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nDevice bus operations\n6.17.1 Customer lockable: Secure silico n region not programmed or protected \nat the factory\nUnless otherwise specified, the device  is shipped such that the customer  may program and protect the 256-byte \nsecure silicon region. \nThe system may program the secure silicon region using the write-buffer method, in addition to the standard \nprogramming command sequence. See “Command definitions” on page 33. Note that the ACC function and \nunlock bypass modes are not available when  the secure silicon region is enabled.  \nProgramming and protecting the secure silicon region must be used with caution since, once protected, there is \nno procedure available for unprotecting the secure silicon region area and none of the bits in the secure silicon \nregion memory space can be modified in any way. \nThe secure silicon region area can be protected using one of the following procedures: \n• Write the three-cycle Enter Secure Silicon Region command.\n• To verify the protect / unprotect status of th e secure silicon region, follow the algorithm.\nOnce the secure silicon region is programmed, locked and verified, the system must write the Exit Secure Silicon \nRegion command sequence or Reset / ASO Exit command to  return to reading and writing within the remainder \nof the array.\n6.17.2 Factory locked: Secure silicon re gion programmed and protected at the \nfactory\nIn devices with an ESN, the secure silicon region is pr otected when the device is shipped from the factory. The \nsecure silicon region cannot be modified in any way. An ESN factory locked device has an 16-byte random ESN at addresses 000000h–000007h. Please contact your sales represen tative for details on ordering ESN factory locked \ndevices.\nCustomers may opt to have their code programmed by the factory through the ExpressFlash service (Express \nflash factory locked). The devices are then shipped from the factory with the secure silicon region permanently \nlocked. Contact your sales representative fo r details on using the ExpressFlash service.\n6.18 Write Protect (WP#/ACC)\nThe Write Protect function provides a hardware method of protecting the first or last sector for uniform sector \nmodel or it protects the first or last two se ctors for the boot sector model without using VID. Write Protect is one \nof two functions provided by the WP#/ACC input.\nIf the system asserts VIL on the WP#/ACC pin, the device disables program and erase functions in the first or last \nsector independently of whether those sectors were protected or unprotected. Note that if WP#/ACC is at VIL \nwhen the device is in the standby mode, the maximum input load curren t is increased. See the table in “DC \ncharacteristics” on page 83.\nIf the system asserts VIH on the WP#/ACC pin, the device reverts to whether the protected sectors previously set \nto be protected or unprotected using the method described in “Advanced sector protection” on page 21 to \n“Persistent protection bit lock (PPB lock bit)” on page 26. Note that WP#/ACC contains an internal pull-up; \nwhen unconnected, WP#/ACC is at VIH.\nDatasheet 28 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nDevice bus operations\n6.19 Hardware data protection\nThe command sequence requirement of unlock cycles fo r programming or erasing provides data protection \nagainst inadvertent writes (refer to Table 23  and Table 25  for command definitions). In addition, the following \nhardware data protection measures prevent accidental erasure or programming, which might otherwise be caused by spurious system level signals during V\nCC power-up and power-down transitions, or from system noise.\n6.19.1 Low VCC write inhibit\nWhen VCC is less than VLKO, the device does not accept any write cycles. This protects data during VCC power-up \nand power-down. The command register and all internal program / erase circuits are disabled, and the device \nresets to the read mode. Subsequent writes are ignored until VCC is greater than VLKO. The system must provide \nthe proper signals to the control pins to prevent unintentional writes when VCC is greater than VLKO.\n6.19.2 Write pulse glitch protection\nNoise pulses of less than 5 ns (typical) on OE #, CE# or WE# do not initiate a write cycle.\n6.19.3 Logical inhibit\nWrite cycles are inhibited by holding any one of OE# = VIL, CE# = VIH or WE# = VIH. To initiate a write cycle, CE# and \nWE# must be a logical zero while OE# is a logical one.\n6.19.4 Power-up write inhibit\nIf WE# = CE# = VIL and OE# = VIH during power-up, the device does not accept commands on the rising edge of \nWE#. The internal state machine is automatically reset to the read mode on power-up.\nDatasheet 29 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommon flash memory interface\n7 Common flash memory interface\nThe common flash interface (CFI) spec ification outlines device and host system software interrogation \nhandshake, which allows specif ic vendor-specified software algorithms to be used for entire families of devices. \nSoftware support can then be device-indepen dent, JEDEC ID-independent, and forward- and \nbackward-compatible for the specified flash device fa milies.

No commands are required to \nretrieve data. The device is ready to read array data after completing an Embedded Program or Embedded Erase algorithm.\nAfter the device accepts an Erase Suspend command, th e device enters the erase-suspend-read mode, after \nwhich the system can read data from any non-eras e-suspended sector. After completing a programming \noperation in the Erase Suspend mode, th e system may once again read array data with the same exception. See \n“Erase Suspend / Erase Resume commands” on page 45 for more information.\nThe system must issue the reset command to return the de vice to the read (or erase-suspend-read) mode if DQ5 \ngoes high during an active program or erase operatio n, or if the device is in the autoselect mode. See Reset \ncommand  below for more information.\nSee also “Requirements for reading array data” on page 15 for more information. The Read-Only Operations \n– “AC characteristics” on page 90 provide the read parameters, and Figure 23  shows the timing diagram.\n8.2 Reset command\nWriting the Reset command resets the device to the read or erase-suspend-read mode. Address bits are don’t \ncares for this command.\nThe Reset command may be written between the sequence cycles in an erase command sequence before erasing \nbegins. This resets the device to the read mode. Once erasure begins, however, the device ignores reset commands until the operation is complete.\nThe Reset command may be written between the sequence cycles in a program command sequence before \nprogramming begins. This resets the device to the read mode. If the program command sequence is written while the device is in the Erase Suspend mode, writin g the reset command returns the device to the \nerase-suspend-read mode. Once programming begins, however, the device ignores reset commands until the operation is complete.\nThe Reset command may be written between the sequence cycles in an autoselect command sequence. Once in \nthe autoselect mode, the Reset command must be written to return to the read mode. If the device entered the autoselect mode while in the Erase Suspend mode, wr iting the Reset command returns the device to the \nerase-suspend-read mode.\nIf DQ5 goes high during a program or erase operation, writing the Reset command returns the device to the read \nmode (or erase-suspend-read mode if  the device was in Erase Suspend).\nNote that if DQ1 goes high during a Write Buffer  Programming operation, the system must write the \nWrite-to-Buffer-Abort Reset command sequence to reset the device for the next operation. \nDatasheet 34 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommand definitions\n8.3 Autoselect command sequence\nThe Autoselect command sequence allows the host system to read several identifier codes at specific addresses:\nThe Autoselect command sequence is initiated by first writin g on unlock cycle (two cycles).

The system \nmay read at any address any number of times with out initiating another Autoselect command sequence:\nThe system must write the reset command to return to th e read mode (or erase-suspen d-read mode if the device \nwas previously in Erase Suspend).\n8.4 Status Register ASO\nThe Status Register ASO contains a single word of registered volatile status for Embedded Algorithms. When the Status Register Read command is issued, the current status  is captured by the register and the ASO is entered. \nThe Status Register content appears at all word loca tions in the device address space. However, it is \nrecommended to read the status only at word location 0 for future compatibility. The first read access in the Status Register ASO or a Software Reset / ASO Exit write command exits the ASO and returns to the address space map in use when the Status Register  Read command was issued. It is not recommended to perform any other \ncommand after the Status Register Read command is given and before the Status Register ASO is exited.\n8.5 Enter / Exit Secure Silicon Region command sequence\nThe secure silicon region provides a secured data area co ntaining an 8-word / 16-byte random electronic serial \nnumber (ESN). The system can access the secure silicon region by issuing the three-cycle Enter Secure Silicon \nRegion command sequence.

The device automatically provides internally  generated program pulses and verifies the programmed \ncell margin. Table 23  and Table 25  show the address and data requirements for the Word Program command \nsequence, respectively.\nWhen the Embedded Program algorithm is complete, the device then returns to the read mode and addresses \nare no longer latched. The system can determine the stat us of the program operation by using DQ7 or DQ6. Refer \nto “Write Operation status” on page 56 for information on these status bits. Any commands written to the \ndevice during the Embedded Program algorithm are ignored. Note that the secure silicon region, autoselect, and CFI functions are unavailable when a program operation is  in progress. Note that a hardware reset immediately \nterminates the program operation. The Program comman d sequence should be reinitiated once the device \nreturns to the read mode, to ensure data integrity.\nProgramming is allowed in any sequence of address loca tions and across sector boundaries. Programming to the \nsame word address multiple times without intervening erases (increme ntal bit programming) requires a \nmodified programming method. For such application requirements, please contact your local Infineon representative. Word programming is supported for backwa rd compatibility with existing flash driver software \nand for occasional writing of individual words. Use of  write buffer programming (see below) is strongly \nrecommended for general programming use when more than a few words are to be programmed. \nAny bit in a word cannot be programmed from  ‘0’ back to ‘1’ .  Attempting to do so may cause DQ7 and  DQ6 \nstatus bits to indicate the operation was successful. Howe ver, a succeeding read shows that the data is still ‘0’ . \nOnly erase operations can convert ‘0’ to ‘1’ .\n8.8 Unlock Bypass command sequence\nThis device features an Unlock Bypass mode to facili tate shorter programming and erase commands. Once the \ndevice enters the Unlock Bypass mode, only two write cy cles are required to program or erase data, instead of \nthe normal four or six cycles, respectively.\nThe Unlock Bypass command sequence is initiated by first wr iting two unlock cycles. This is followed by a third \nwrite cycle containing the Unlock Bypass command, 20h . The device then enters the Unlock Bypass mode.\nThis mode dispenses with the initial two unlock cycles  required in the standard program sequence and four \nunlock cycles in the Standard Erase command sequen ce, resulting in faster total programming and erase \ntimes. Table 23  and Table 25  show the requirements for the Unlock Bypass command sequences.\nDuring the Unlock Bypass mode, only the Read, Program,  Write Buffer Programming, Write-to-Buffer-Abort Reset, \nUnlock Bypass Sector Erase, Unlock Bypass Chip Erase and Unlock Bypass Reset commands are valid. To exit the Unlock Bypass mode, the system must issue the two-cycle Unlock Bypass Reset command sequence. The first cycle address is ‘don’t care’ and the data 90h. The second cycle need only contain the data 00h. The sector then \nreturns to the read mode.\nDatasheet 37 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommand definitions\n8.9 Write buffer programming\nWrite Buffer Programming allows the system write to  a maximum of 128 words / 256 bytes in one programming \noperation. This results in faster effective programming time than the standard programming algorithms. The \nWrite Buffer Programming command sequence is initiated by  first writing two unlock cy cles. This is followed by \na third write cycle containing the Write Buffer Load  command written at the sector address in which \nprogramming occurs. The fourth cycle wr ites the sector address and the numb er of word locations, minus one, \nto be programmed. For example, if the system programs six unique address locations, then 05h should be written to the device. This tells the device how many write buffer  addresses are loaded with data and therefore when to \nexpect the Program Buffer to Flash command. The number of locations to program cannot exceed the size of the \nwrite buffer or the operation aborts.\nThe fifth cycle writes the first address location and data to be programmed. The write- buffer-page is selected by \naddress bits A\nMAX–A7. All subsequent address / data pairs must fa ll within the selected-write-buffer-page. The \nsystem then writes the remaining address / data pairs into  the write buffer. Write buffer locations may be loaded \nin any order.\nThe write-buffer-page address must be the same for all ad dress / data pairs loaded into the write buffer. (This \nmeans Write Buffer Programming cannot be performed across  multiple write-buffer pages.) This also means that \nWrite Buffer Programming cannot be performed across mu ltiple sectors. If the system attempts to load \nprogramming data outside of the selected write-buffer page, the operation aborts. \nNote that if a Write Buffer address location is loaded  multiple times, the address / data pair counter is \ndecremented for every data load operation. The host sy stem must therefore account for loading a write-buffer \nlocation more than once. The counter decrements fo r each data load operation, not for each unique \nwrite-buffer-address location. Note also that if an address location is loaded more than once into the buffer, the \nfinal data loaded for that address is programmed.\nOnce the specified number of write bu ffer locations are loaded, the system must then write the Program Buffer \nto Flash command at the sector address. Any other address and data combination aborts the Write Buffer Programming operation. The device then begins programmin g. Data polling should be used while monitoring the \nlast address location loaded into the write buffer. DQ7,  DQ6, DQ5, and DQ1 should be monitored to determine \nthe device status during Write Buffer Programming. \nThe Write Buffer Programming operation can be susp ended using the standard Program Suspend / Resume \ncommands. Upon successful completion of the Write Bu ffer Programming operation, the device is ready to \nexecute the next command.\nThe Write Buffer Programming sequence can be aborted in the following ways: \n• Load a value that is greater than the page buffer si ze during the Number of Locations to Program step.\n• Write to an address in a sector different than th e one specified during the Write-Buffer-Load command.\n• Write an Address / Data pair to a different write-buffer-p age than the one selected by the Starting Address during \nthe write buffer data loading stage of the operation.\n• Write data other than the Confirm Command after the specified number of data load cycles.\nThe abort condition is indicated by DQ1 = 1, DQ7 = DATA# (for the last address location loaded), DQ6 = toggle, and \nDQ5 = 0. A Write-to-Buffer-Abort Reset command sequence must be written to reset the device for the next \noperation.\nNote that the secure silicon region, autoselect, and CFI functions are unavailable when a program operation is in \nprogress.  This flash device is capable of handling multiple  write buffer programming operations on the same \nwrite buffer address range without intervening erases. For applications requiring incremental bit programming, \na modified programming method is required; please contact your local Infineon representative. Any bit in a \nwrite buffer address range cannot be programmed from  ‘0’ back to ‘1’ .  Attempting to do so may cause the \ndevice to set DQ5 = 1, of cause the DQ7 and DQ6 status bi ts to indicate the operation was successful. However, a \nsucceeding read shows that the data is still ‘0’ .  Only erase operations can convert ‘0’ to ‘1’ .\nDatasheet 38 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommand definitions\n8.10 Accelerated program\nThe device supports program operations when the system asserts VHH on the WP#/ACC or ACC pin. When \nWP#/ACC or ACC pin is lowered back to VIH or VIL the device exits the Accelerated Programming mode and returns \nto normal operation. The WP#/ACC is VHH tolerant but is not designed to accelerate the program functions. If the \nsystem asserts VHH on this input, the device automatically enters  the Unlock Bypass mode. The system can then \nuse the Write Buffer Load command sequence provid ed by the Unlock Bypass mode. Note that if a \nWrite-to-Buffer-Abort Reset is required while in Unlock Bypass mode, the full 3-cycle RESET command sequence must be used to reset the device. Note that the WP#/ACC pin must not be at V\nHH for operations other than \naccelerated programming, or device damage may result. WP# contains an internal pull-up; when unconnected, \nWP# is at VIH. Accelerated programming is supported at room temperature only.\nFigure 9  illustrates the algorithm for the program operation. Refer to Table 76  for parameters, and Figure 34  for \ntiming diagrams.\n• Sectors must be unlocked prior to raising WP#/ACC to VHH.\n• It is recommended that WP#/ACC apply VHH after power-up sequence is completed. In addition, it is \nrecommended that WP#/ACC apply from VHH to VIH/VIL before powering down VCC/VIO.\nDatasheet 39 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommand definitions\nFigure 9 Write buffer programming operationWrite “Write to Buffer” \ncommand and \nSector Address\nWrite number of addresses\nto program minus 1(WC) \nand Sector Address\nWrite program buffer to\nflash sector addressWrite first address/data\nWrite to a different\nsector address\nFAIL or ABORT PASSRead DQ7 - DQ0 at\nLast Loaded Address\nRead DQ7 - DQ0 with \naddress = Last Loaded\nAddressWrite next address/data pair\nWC = WC - 1WC = 0 ?Part of “Write to Buffer”\nCommand Sequence\nYe s\nYe s\nYe sYe s\nYe s Ye sNo\nNo\nNo\nNoNoNoAbort Write to\nBuffer Operation?\nDQ7 = Data?\nDQ7 = Data?DQ5 = 1?

When the Program Suspend command is written during a programming process, the device halts the program operation within t\nPSL (program \nsuspend latency) and updates the status bits. Addresse s are not required when writing the Program Suspend \ncommand.\nThere are two commands available for program suspen d. The legacy combined Erase / Program suspend \ncommand (B0h command code) and the separate Progra m Suspend command (51h command code). There are \nalso two commands for program resume. The legacy combined Erase / Program Resume command (30h \ncommand code) and the separate Program Resume comman d (50h command code). It is recommended to use \nthe separate program suspend and resume commands fo r programming and use the legacy combined command \nonly for erase suspend and resume.\nAfter the programming operation is suspended, the system  can read array data from any non-suspended sector. \nThe Program Suspend command may also be issued du ring a programming operation while an erase is \nsuspended. In this case, data may be read from any addresses not in Erase Suspend or Program Suspend. If a read is needed from the secure silicon region area (one-tim e program area), then user must use the proper command \nsequences to enter and exit this region. Note that the secure silicon region, autoselect, and CFI functions are \nunavailable when a program operation is in progress.\nThe system may also write the Autosel ect command sequence when the device  is in the Program Suspend mode. \nThe system can read as many Autoselect codes as required. When the device exits the Autoselect mode, the device reverts to the Program Suspend mode, and is ready for another valid operation. See “Autoselect \ncommand sequence” on page 34 for more information. \nAfter the Program Resume command is written, the device reverts to programming. The system can determine \nthe status of the program operation using the DQ7 or DQ6 st atus bits, just as in the standard program operation. \nSee “Write Operation status” on page 56 for more information. \nThe system must write the Program Resume command (addre ss bits are don’t care) to exit the Program Suspend \nmode and continue the programming operation. Further writes of the Resume command are ignored. Another \nProgram Suspend command can be written after the device resumes programming. \nProgram operations can be interrupted as often as necessary but in order for a program operation to progress to \ncompletion there must be some periods of time betw een resume and the next suspend command greater than \nor equal to t\nPRS as listed in Table 78  and Table 79 .\nDatasheet 42 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommand definitions\nFigure 11 Program suspend / program resumeProgram Operation\nor Write-to-Buffer\nSequence in Progress\nWrite Program SuspendCommand Sequence\nCommand is also valid for \nErase-suspended-programoperations\nAutoselect and Secured Silicon Region\nread operations are also allowed\nData cannot be read from erase- or\nprogram-suspended sectors\nWrite Program Resume\nCommand SequenceRead data as\nrequired\nDone\nreading?No\nYe s\nWrite address/data\nXXXh/30h\nDevice reverts to\noperation prior to\nProgram SuspendWrite address/data\nXXXh/B0h\nWait t     PSL\nDatasheet 43 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommand definitions\n8.12 Chip Erase command sequence\nChip Erase is a six bus cycle operation. The Chip Eras e command sequence is initiated by writing two unlock \ncycles, followed by a set-up command. Two additional unlo ck write cycles are then followed by the Chip Erase \ncommand, which in turn invokes the Embe dded Erase algorithm. The device does  not require the system to \npre-program prior to erase. The Embedded Erase algorith m automatically preprograms and verifies the entire \nmemory for an all zero data pattern prior to electrical erase. The system is not required to provide any controls \nor timings during these operations. Table 23  and Table 25  show the address and data requirements for the Chip \nErase command sequence.\nWhen the Embedded Erase algorithm is complete, the de vice returns to the read mode and addresses are no \nlonger latched. The system can determine the status of th e erase operation by using DQ7, DQ6, or DQ2. Refer to \n“Write Operation status” on page 56 for information on these status bits.\nThe Unlock Bypass feature allows the host system to send program commands to the flash device without first \nwriting unlock cycles within  the command sequence. See “Unlock Bypass command sequence” on page 36 for \ndetails on the Unlock Bypass function.\nAny commands written during the Chip Erase operation ar e ignored. However, note that a hardware reset \nimmediately terminates the erase operation. If this occurs, the Chip Erase command sequence should be \nreinitiated once the device returns to read ing array data, to ensure data integrity.\nFigure 12  illustrates the algorithm for the erase operation. Refer to “Asynchronous write operations” on \npage 95 for parameters, and Figure 35  for timing diagrams.\n8.13 Sector Erase command sequence\nSector Erase is a six bus cycle operation. The Sector Er ase command sequence is initiated by writing two unlock \ncycles, followed by a set-up command. Two additional unlo ck cycles are written, and are then followed by the \naddress of the sector to be erased, and the Sector Erase command. Table 23  and Table 25  shows the address and \ndata requirements for the Sector Erase command sequence. \nThe device does not require the system to pre-program prior to erase. The Embedded Erase algorithm \nautomatically programs and verifies the entire memory for an all zero data pattern prior to electrical erase. The \nsystem is not required to provide any co ntrols or timings during these operations. \nAfter the command sequence is written, a sector erase time-out of tSEA occurs. During the time-out period, \nadditional sector addresses and sector erase command s may be written. Invalid commands will be ignored \nduring the time-out period. Loading the sector erase buff er may be done in any sequence, and the number of \nsectors may be from one sector to all sectors. The time between these additional cycles  must be less than 50 µs, \notherwise erasure may begin. Any sector erase address and command following the exceeded time-out may or \nmay not be accepted. It is recommended that processor interrupts be disabled during this time to ensure all commands are accepted. The interrupts can be re-enabled after the last Sector Erase command is written. Note \nthat the secure silicon region, autoselect, and CFI func tions are unavailable when an erase operation is in \nprogress.  The system must rewrite the command sequence  and any additional addresses and commands.\nThe system can monitor DQ3 to determine if the sector erase timer has timed out (See “DQ3: Sector erase timer” \non page 61). The time-out begins from the rising ed ge of the final WE# pulse in the command sequence.\nIf the sector is found to have not completed its last eras e successfully, the sector is unconditionally erased. If the \nlast erase was successful, the sector is read to determine if the sector is still erased  (blank). The erase operation \nis started immediately after finding any programmed zero. If the sector is already blank (no programmed zero bit \nfound) the remainder of the erase operation is skipped.  This can dramatically reduce erase time when sectors \nbeing erased do not need the erase operation. When enabled the blank check feature is used within the \nparameter erase, sector erase, and bulk erase command s. When blank check is disabled an erase command \nunconditionally starts the erase operation.\nWhen the Embedded Erase algorithm is complete, the device returns to reading array data and addresses are no \nlonger latched. The system can determine the status of the erase operation by readin g DQ7, DQ6, or DQ2 in the \nerasing sector. Refer to “Write Operation status” on page 56 for information on these status bits.\nOnce the sector erase operation begins, only the Er ase Suspend command is valid. All other commands are \nignored. However, note that a hardware reset immediately  terminates the erase operation. If that occurs, the \nsector erase command sequence should be reinitiated once  the device returns to reading array data, to ensure \ndata integrity.\nDatasheet 44 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommand definitions\nFigure 12  illustrates the algorithm for the erase operation.

This command is valid on ly during the sector erase \noperation, including the tESL time-out period during the Sector Er ase command sequence. The Erase Suspend \ncommand is ignored if written during the chip erase operation or Embedded Program algorithm. \nWhen the Erase Suspend command is written during the sector erase op eration, the device requires tESL (erase \nsuspend latency) to suspend the erase operation. Howeve r, when the Erase Suspend command is written during \nthe sector erase time-out, the device immediately term inates the time-out period and suspends the erase \noperation. \nAfter the erase operation is suspended, the device ente rs the erase-suspend-read mode. The system can read \ndata from or program data to any sector not selected for erasure. (The device erase suspends all sectors selected \nfor erasure.) Reading at any address within erase-suspen ded sectors produces status information on DQ7–DQ0. \nThe system can use DQ7, or DQ6 and DQ2 together, to determine if a sector is actively erasing or is \nerase-suspended. Refer to “Write Operation status” on page 56 for information on these status bits.\nAfter an erase-suspended program operation is complete , the device returns to the erase-suspend-read mode. \nThe system can determine the status of the program operat ion using the DQ7 or DQ6 status bits, just as in the \nstandard word program operation. Refer to “Write Operation status” on page 56 for more information.\nIn the erase-suspend-read mode, the system can also  issue the Autoselect command sequence. Refer to the \n“Autoselect mode” on page 20 and “Autoselect command sequence” on page 34 sections for details.\nTo resume the sector erase operation, the system must  write the Erase Resume command. Further writes of the \nResume command are ignored. Another Erase Suspend co mmand can be written after the chip resumes erasing.\nDuring an erase operation, this flas h device performs multiple internal operations which are invisible to the \nsystem. When an erase operation is suspended, any of the internal operations that were not fully completed must \nbe restarted. As such, if this flash device is continua lly issued suspend / resume commands in rapid succession, \nerase progress is impeded as a function of the number of suspends. The result  is a longer cumulative erase time \nthan without suspends. Note that the additional suspends do not affect device reliability or future performance. \nIn most systems rapid erase / suspend activity occurs on ly briefly. In such cases, erase performance is not \nsignificantly impacted. \nErase operations can be interrupted as  often as necessary but in order for an erase operation to progress to \ncompletion there must be some periods of time betw een resume and the next suspend command greater than \nor equal to tERS as listed in Table 78  and Table 79 .\n8.15 Evaluate Erase Status\nThe Evaluate Erase Status (EES) command verifies that the last erase operation on the addressed sector was \ncompleted successfully. The EES command can be used to de tect erase operations failed due to loss of power, \nreset, or failure during the erase operation.\nTo initiate a EES on a Sector, write 35h to the sector  address (SA), while the EAC is in the standby state\nThe ESS command may not be written while the device is actively programming or erasing or suspended.\nThe EES command does not allow for reads to the array during the operation. Reads to the array while this \ncommand is executing will return unknown data.\nUse the Status Register read to confirm if the device is stil l busy and when complete if th e sector is erased or not. \nBit 7 of the Status Register will show if the device is pe rforming a ESS (similar to an erase operation). Bit 5 of the \nStatus Register will be cleared to ‘0’ if the sector is erased and set to ‘1’ if not erased.\nAs soon as any bit is found to not be erased, the de vice will halt the operation and report the results.\nOnce the ESS is completed, the EAC will return to the Standby state.\nThe EES command requires tEES (refer to Table 78 ) to complete and update the erase status in SR. The DRB bit \n(SR[7]) may be read to determine when the EES command is finished. If a sector is found not erased with \nSR[5] = 1, the sector must be erased again to ensure reliable storage of data in the sector.\nDatasheet 46 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nCommand definitions\n8.16 Continuity Check\nThe Continuity Check provides a basic test of connectivit y from package connectors to each die pad. This feature \nis an extension of the legacy unlock cycle sequence used at the beginning of several commands. The unlock \nsequence is two writes with alternating ones and zeros pa ttern on the lower portion of the address and data lines \nwith the pattern inverted between the first and second write.\nTo perform a continuity check these patterns ar e extended to cover all address and data lines:\nA logic comparison circuit looks for the alternating one an d zero pattern that is inverted between the two write \ncycles.\nWhen the correct patterns are detected, the status register bit zero is set to ‘1’ .

Prev ious generations of the S 29GL flash family used the \nmethods called Data Polling and Ready/Busy# (RY/BY#) Si gnal. These methods are still supported by the S29GL-S \nfamily. One additional method is reading the Status Register. \n10.1 Status Register\nThe status of program and erase operatio ns is provided by a single 16-bit status register. The Status Register Read \ncommand is written followed by one read access of the St atus Register information. The contents of the Status \nRegister is aliased (overlaid) in all locations of the device address space. The overlay is in effect for one read \naccess, specifically the next read access that follows the Status Register Read command. After the one Status \nRegister access, the Status Register ASO is exited. The CE# or OE# signal must go HIGH following the Status \nRegister read access for tCEPH /tOEPH  time to return to the address space active at the time the Status Register \nRead command was issued.\nThe Status Register contains bits related to the results - success or failure - of the most recently completed \nEmbedded Algorithms (EA): \n• Erase Status (bit 5), \n• Program Status (bit 4), • Write Buffer Abort (bit 3),\n• Sector Locked Status (bit 1), \n•R F U  ( b i t  0 ) .  \nand, bits related to the current state of any in process EA: \n•D e v i c e  B u s y  ( b i t  7 ) ,  \n• Erase Suspended (bit 6), • Program Suspended (bit 2), \nThe current state bits indicate whether an EA  is in process, suspended, or completed.\nThe upper 8 bits (bits 15:8) are reserved.

Table 30  and the following subsections describe the func tion of these bits. DQ7 and DQ6 each offer a \nmethod for determining whether a program or erase oper ation is complete or in progress. The device also \nprovides a hardware-based output signal, RY/BY#, to determine whether an Embedded Program or Erase operation is in progress or is completed.\n10.3 DQ7: Data# Polling\nThe Data# Polling bit, DQ7, indicates to the host system  whether an Embedded Progra m or Erase algorithm is in \nprogress or completed, or whether the device is in Erase Suspend. Data# Polling is valid after the rising edge of \nthe final WE# pulse in the command sequence.\nDuring the Embedded Program algo rithm, the device outputs on DQ 7 the complement of the datum \nprogrammed to DQ7. This DQ7 status also applies to programming during Erase Suspend. When programming in \n×8 mode, the DQ7 polling value will be the DATA# of the last byte entered, regard less if the byte is at an even or \nodd address. When the Embedded Program algorithm is  complete, the device outputs the datum programmed \nto DQ7. The system must provide the program address to  read valid status information on DQ7. If a program \naddress falls within a protected sector, Data# Polling on DQ7 is active for approximately tDP, then the device \nreturns to the read mode. \nDuring the Embedded Erase algorithm, Data# Polling pr oduces ‘0’ on DQ7. When the Embedded Erase algorithm \nis complete, or if the device enters the Erase Suspend mo de, Data# Polling produces ‘1’ on DQ7. The system must \nprovide an address within any of the sectors selected for erasure to read valid status information on DQ7.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if all sect ors selected for erasing are protected, Data# Polling on \nDQ7 is active for approximately tDP, then the device returns to the read mode. If not all selected sectors are \nprotected, the Embedded Erase algorithm erases the unpr otected sectors, and ignores the selected sectors that \nare protected. However, if the system reads DQ7 at an address within a protected sector, the status may not be \nvalid.\nJust prior to the completion of an Embedded Program or  Erase operation, DQ7 may change asynchronously with \nDQ0–DQ6 while Output Enable (OE#) is asserted LOW. Th at is, the device may change from providing status \ninformation to valid data on DQ7. Depending on when th e system samples the DQ7 output, it may read the status \nor valid data. Even if the device completed the program or erase operation and DQ7 has valid data, the data outputs on DQ0–DQ6 may be still invalid. Valid data on DQ0–DQ7 appears on successive read cycles. \nTable 30  shows the outputs for Data# Polling on DQ7. Figure 13  shows the Data# Polling algorithm. Figure 36  \nshows the Data# Polling timing diagram.\nDatasheet 57 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nStatus monitoring\nFigure 13 Data# polling algorithmDQ7 = Data?Yes\nNo\nNoDQ5 = 1?No\nYes\nYes\nFAIL PASSRead DQ15–DQ0\nAddr = VA\nRead DQ15–DQ0\nAddr = VA\nDQ7 = Data?START\nNotes\n98.VA = Valid address for programming.

Toggle Bit I may be read at any address, and is valid after \nthe rising edge of the final WE# pulse  in the command sequence (prior to the program or erase operation), and \nduring the sector erase time-out.\nDuring an Embedded Program or Erase algorithm operation, successive read cycles to any address cause DQ6 to \ntoggle. The system may use either OE# or CE# to contro l the read cycles. When the operation is complete, DQ6 \nstops toggling.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if all sect ors selected for erasing are protected, DQ6 toggles for \napproximately tDP, then returns to reading array data. If not a ll selected sectors are protected, the Embedded \nErase algorithm erases the unprotec ted sectors, and ignores the selected sectors that are protected. \nThe system can use DQ6 and DQ2 together to determ ine whether a sector is actively erasing or is \nerase-suspended. When the device is actively erasing (tha t is, the Embedded Erase algorithm is in progress), DQ6 \ntoggles. When the device enters the Erase Suspend mode , DQ6 stops toggling. However, the system must also \nuse DQ2 to determine which sectors are erasing or eras e-suspended. Alternatively, the system can use DQ7 (see \n“DQ7: Data# Polling” on page 56).\nIf a program address falls within a protected sector, DQ6 toggles for approximately tDP after the program \ncommand sequence is written, then  returns to reading array data.\nDQ6 also toggles during the erase-suspend-program mode, and stops toggling once the Embedded Program \nalgorithm is complete.\nTable 30  shows the outputs for Toggle Bit I on DQ6. Figure 14  shows the toggle bit algorithm. Figure 37  shows \nthe toggle bit timing diagrams. Figure 38  shows the differences between DQ2 an d DQ6 in graphical form.

(The Toggle Bit II does not apply to the PPB Erase command.) Toggle Bit II is vali d after the rising edge of the final WE# pulse in the \ncommand sequence.\nDQ2 toggles when the system reads at addresses within thos e sectors that were selected for erasure. (The system \nmay use either OE# or CE# to control the read cycles.) But DQ2 cannot distinguish whether the sector is actively \nerasing or is erase-suspended. DQ6, by comparison, indicates whether the device is actively erasing, or is in Erase \nSuspend, but cannot distingu ish which sectors are selected for erasure. Thus, both status bits are required for \nsector and mode information. Refer to Table 30  to compare outputs for DQ2 and DQ6. \nFigure 14  shows the toggle bit algo rithm in flowchart form. Figure 37  shows the toggle bit timing diagram. \nFigure 38  shows the differences between DQ2 and DQ6 in graphical form.\n10.6 Reading Toggle Bits DQ6/DQ2\nRefer to Figure 14  for the following discussion. Whenever the system  initially begins reading toggle bit status, it \nmust read DQ7–DQ0 at least twice in a row to determine whether a toggle bit is toggling. Typically, the system \nwould note and store the value of the toggle bit after the first read. After the second read, the system would \ncompare the new value of the toggle bit with the first. If  the toggle bit is not toggling, the device completed the \nprogram or erase operation. The system can read ar ray data on DQ7–DQ0 on the following read cycle.\nHowever, if after the initial two read cycles, the system de termines that the toggle bit is still toggling, the system \nalso should note whether th e value of DQ5 is high (see “DQ5: Exceeded timing limits” on page 60). If it is, the \nsystem should then determine again whether the toggle bit is toggling, since the toggle bit may have stopped \ntoggling just as DQ5 went high. If the toggle bit is no  longer toggling, the device  successfully completed the \nprogram or erase operation. If it is still toggling, the device did not completed the operation successfully, and the system must write the reset command to return to reading array data. It is recommended that data read for polling only be used for polling purposes. Once toggling has stopped array data will be available on subsequent \nreads.\nThe remaining scenario is that the system initially determin es that the toggle bit is toggling and DQ5 has not gone \nhigh. The system may continue to monitor the toggle bit and DQ5 through successive read cycles, determining \nthe status as described in the previous paragraph. Altern atively, it may choose to perform other system tasks. In \nthis case, the system must start at the beginning of the algorithm when it returns to determine the status of the \noperation (top of Figure 14 ).\n10.7 DQ5: Exceeded timing limits\nDQ5 indicates whether the program or erase time exceeded  a specified internal pulse count limit. Under these \nconditions DQ5 produces ‘1’ indicating that the program or erase cycle was not successfully completed.\nIn all these cases, the system must write the reset comman d to return the device to the reading the array (or to \nerase-suspend-read if the device was previously in the er ase-suspend-program mode). In this case, it is possible \nthat the flash will continue to communicate busy for up to tTOR after the reset command is sent.\nDatasheet 61 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nStatus monitoring\n10.8 DQ3: Sector erase timer\nAfter writing a sector erase command sequence, the syst em may read DQ3 to determine whether or not erasure \nbegan. (The sector erase timer does not apply to th e chip erase command or the PPB erase command.) If \nadditional sectors are selected for eras ure, the entire time-out also applie s after each additional sector erase \ncommand. When the time-out period is complete, DQ3 switch es from ‘0’ to ‘1’ . If the time between additional \nsector erase commands from the system can be assumed to be less than tSEA, the system need not monitor DQ3. \nSee also “Sector Erase command sequence” on page 43.\nAfter the sector erase command is written, the system should read the status of DQ7 (Data# Polling) or DQ6 \n(Toggle Bit I) to ensure that the device accepted the co mmand sequence, and then read DQ3. If DQ3 is ‘1’ , the \nEmbedded Erase algorithm has begun; all further comman ds (except Erase Suspend) are ignored until the erase \noperation is complete. If DQ3 is ‘0’ , the device acce pts additional sector erase commands. To ensure the \ncommand is accepted, the system software should ch eck the status of DQ3 prior to and following each \nsubsequent sector erase command. If DQ 3 is high on the second status chec k, the last command might not have \nbeen accepted. Table 30  shows the status of DQ3 relative to the other status bits.\n10.9 DQ1: Write-to-Buffer abort\nDQ1 indicates whether a Write-to-Buffer operation was ab orted. Under these conditions DQ1 produces ‘1’ . The \nsystem must issue the Write-to-Buffer-Abort-Reset comma nd sequence to return the device to reading array \ndata. See “Write buffer” on page 15 for more details.\nTable 30 Write operation status\nStatus DQ7[101]DQ6 DQ5[102]DQ3 DQ2[101]DQ1 RY/BY#\nStandard ModeEmbedded Program Algorithm DQ7# Toggle 0 N/ANo \ntoggle00\nEmbedded Erase Algorithm 0 Toggle 0 1 Toggle N/A 0\nProgram Suspend \nModeProgram\n-\nSuspend \nReadProgram-Suspended \nSectorInvalid (not allowed) 1\nNon-Program\nSuspended SectorData 1\nErase Suspend ModeErase-\nSuspend ReadErase-Suspended \nSector1No \ntoggle0 N/A Toggle N/A 1\nNon-Erase \nSuspended SectorData 1\nErase-Suspend-Program \n(Embedded Program) [103] DQ7# Toggle 0 N/A N/A N/A 0\nWrite-to-\nBufferBusy [104]DQ7# Toggle 0 N/A N/A 0 0\nAbort [105]DQ7# Toggle 0 N/A N/A 1 0\nNotes\n101.DQ7 and DQ2 require a valid address when reading stat us information.

The RY/BY# status is valid after the rising  edge of the final WE# pulse  in the command sequence. \nSince RY/BY# is an open-drain output, several RY/BY# pins can be tied together in parallel with a pull-up resistor \nto VCC.\nIf the output is low (Busy), the device is actively eras ing or programming. (This includes programming in the Erase \nSuspend mode.) If the output is high (Ready), the device is in the read mode, the standby mode, or in the erase-suspend-read mode. Table 30  shows the outputs for RY/BY#. \n10.11 Error types and clearing procedures\nThere are three types of errors reported by the embedd ed operation status methods. Depending on the error \ntype, the status reported and procedure for clearing the erro r status is different. Following is the clearing of error \nstatus:\n• If an ASO was entered before the error the device remains entered in the ASO awaiting ASO read or a command \nwrite.\n• If an erase was suspended before the error the device re turns to the erase suspended state awaiting flash array \nread or a command write.\n• Otherwise, the device will be in standby state awaiting flash array read or a command write. \n10.11.1 Embedded Operation error\nIf an error occurs during an embedded operation (progr am, erase, evaluate erase status, or password unlock) the \ndevice (EAC) remains busy.

During tVCS the device is performing power on reset \noperations.\nDuring power-down or voltage drops below VCC Lockout maximum (VLKO), the VCC and VIO voltages must drop \nbelow VCC Reset (VRST) minimum for a period of tPD for the part to initialize correctly when VCC and VIO again rise \nto their operating ranges. See Figure 16 . If during a voltage drop the VCC stays above VLKO maximum the part will \nstay initialized and will  work correctly when VCC is again above VCC minimum.   If the part locks up from improper \ninitialization, a hardware reset can be used to initialize the part correctly.\nNormal precautions must be taken for supply decoupling to stabilize the VCC and VIO power supplies. Each device \nin a system should have the VCC and VIO power supplies decoupled by a suitable capacitor close to the package \nconnections (this capacitor is generally on th e order of 0.1 µF).

RESET must also be HIGH tRH before CE# goes LOW. \n197.VCC > VIO – 200 mV during power-up.\n198.VCC and VIO ramp rate can be non-linear.\n199.Sum of tRP and tRH must be equal to or greater than tRPH.\nDatasheet 88 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nTest specifications\n14.3.1 Power-on (Cold) reset (POR)\nDuring the rise of power supplies the VIO supply voltage must remain less than or equal to the VCC supply voltage. \nVIH also must remain less than or equal to the VIO supply.\nThe cold reset embedded algorithm requires a relatively long, hundreds of µs, period (tVCS) to load all of the EAC \nalgorithms and default state from non-volatile memory. Du ring the cold reset period all control signals including \nCE# and RESET# are ignored. If CE# is LOW during tVCS the device may draw higher than normal POR current \nduring tVCS but the level of CE# will not affect the cold reset EA . CE# or OE# must transition from HIGH to LOW or \nthere must be an address transition after tVCS for a valid read operation (tACC or tCE is required after tRH). RESET# \nmay be HIGH or LOW during tVCS. If RESET# is LOW during tVCS it may remain LOW at the end of tVCS to hold the \ndevice in the hardware reset state. If RESET# is HIGH at the end of tVCS the device will go to the standby state.\nWhen power is first applied, with supply voltage below VRST then rising to reach operating range minimum, \ninternal device configuration and warm reset activities ar e initiated. CE# is ignored for the duration of the POR \noperation (tVCS or tVIOS ). RESET# LOW during this POR period is opti onal. If RESET# is driven LOW during POR it \nmust satisfy the hardware reset parameters tRP and tRPH. In which case the reset operations will be completed at \nthe later of tVCS or tVIOS  or tRPH.\nDuring cold reset the device will draw ICC7 current.\nFigure 21 Power-up diagramVCC\nVIO\nRESET#\nCE# tRH  tVIOS  tVCS \n tCEH\nDatasheet 89 001-98286 Rev. *I\n2022-07-2864 Mb (8 MB) GL-S MIRRORBIT™ Flash\nParallel, 3.0 V\nTest specifications\n14.3.2 Hardware (warm) reset\nDuring hardware reset (tRPH) the device will draw ICC5 current.\nWhen RESET# continues to be held at VSS, the device draws CMOS standby current (ICC4). If RESET# is held at VIL, \nbut not at VSS, the standby current is greater.\nIf a cold reset has not been completed by the device when RESET# is asserted LOW after tVCS, the Cold Reset# EA \nwill be performed instead of the Warm RESET#, requiring tVCS time to complete. See Figure 22 .\nAfter the device has completed POR and entered the standb y state, any later transition to the hardware reset \nstate will initiate the warm reset embedded algorithm. A warm  reset is much shorter than a cold reset, taking tens \nof µs (tRPH) to complete. During the warm reset EA, any in progress Embedded Algorithm is stopped and the EAC \nis returned to its POR state without reloading EAC algori thms from non-volatile memory. After the warm reset EA \ncompletes, the interface will remain in the hardware reset state if RESET# remains LOW. When RESET# returns \nHIGH the interface will transit to the standby state. If RESE T# is HIGH at the end of the warm reset EA, the interface \nwill directly transit to the standby state. CE# or OE# mu st transition from HIGH to LOW or there must be an \naddress transition after tVCS for a valid read operation (tACC or tCE is required). \nIf POR has not been properly completed by the end of tVCS, a later transition to the hardware reset state will cause \na transition to the power-on reset interface state and in itiate the cold reset embedded algorithm. This ensures \nthe device can complete a cold reset even if some aspe ct of the system power-on voltage ramp-up causes the \nPOR to not initiate or complete correctly. The RY/BY# pin is LOW during cold or warm reset as an indication that the device is busy performing reset operations. \nHardware reset is initiated by the RESET# signal going to V\nIL.\nFigure 22

Endurance and \nretention qualification specifications are specified in JESD47 or may be developed using knowledge-based \nmethods as in JESD94.\nTable 78 Erase and programming performance fo r industrial temperature (–40°C to +85°C)\nParameter Min Typ [248]Max [249]Unit Comments\nSector erase time8 KB – 235 1000ms Includes 00h \nprogramming prior to \nerasure [251]64 KB – 300 1000\nChip erase time [250]– 38.4 65.4 s\nSingle word programming time [250]– 150 1200 µs\nBuffer program time [252]2 byte [250]– 150 1200 \nµs\nExcludes system level \noverhead [253]32 byte [250]– 200 1200 \n64 byte [250]– 220 1200 \n128 byte [250]– 300 1200 \n256 byte – 400 1200 \nEffective write buffer program \noperation per word256 byte – 3.125 – µs\nTotal accelerated effective write \nbuffer program time32 byte [250]– 200 1200 µs64 byte – 220 1200 \nEffective accelerated write buffer \nprogram operation per word64 byte – 6.9 – µs\nChip program time for a 128-word / 256-byte write \nbuffer operation [250] –1 3 . 1 1– s\nErase Suspend / Erase Resume (tESL) – – 30 µs\nProgram Suspend / Program Resume (tPSL) – – 23.5 µs\nErase Resume to next Erase Suspend (tERS) – 100 – µsMinimum of 60 ns but \uf0b3 \ntypical periods are \nneeded for erase to \nprogress to completion.\nProgram Resume to next Program Suspend (tPRS) – 100 – µsMinimum of 60 ns but \uf0b3 \ntypical periods are needed for program to \nprogress to completion.\nEvaluate Erase Status (t\nEES) – 25 30 µs\nNotes\n248.Typical program and erase times assu me the following conditions: 25°C, VCC = 3.0V, 10,000 cycles; random \ndata pattern.\n249.Under worst case conditions of 90°C; Worst case VCC, 100,000 cycles, random pattern.\n250.Not 100% tested.251.In the pre-programming step of the Embedded Eras e algorithm, all bits are programmed to 00h before \nerasure.\n252.Write buffer Programming time is calculated on a pe r-word / per-byte basis for a 128-word / 256-byte write \nbuffer operation.\n253.System-level overhead is the time required to  execute the command seque nce(s) for the program \ncommand.
