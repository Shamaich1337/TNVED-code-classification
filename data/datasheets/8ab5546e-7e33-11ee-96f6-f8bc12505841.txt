The device fully integrates a 7 4mΩ high -side power MOSFET \nand a  40mΩ low -side power MOSFET to provide high -efficiency step -\ndown DC -DC conversion.  \n \nThe AP63356Q/AP63357Q  device is easily used by minimizing the \nexternal componen t count due to its adoption of peak current mode \ncontrol along with its integrated loop compensation network.  \n \nThe AP63356Q/AP63357Q  design is  optimized for Electromagnetic \nInterference (EMI) reduction.  The device has  a proprietary gate driver \nscheme to re sist switching node ringing without sacrificing MOSFET \nturn-on and turn -off times, which reduces high -frequency radiated EMI \nnoise caused by MOSFET switching.  AP63356Q/AP63357Q  also \nfeatures Frequency Spread Spectrum (FSS) with a switching \nfrequency jitter  of ± 6%, which reduces EMI by not allowing emitted \nenergy to stay in any one frequency for a significant period of time.  \n \nThe device is available in a 3mm ×  2mm, V-DFN3020 -13/SWP  (Type \nA1), package  with wettable flanks.  \n \nFeatures  \n\uf0b7 AEC-Q100 Qualified with the Following Results  \n\uf0a7 Device Temperature Grade 1: -40°C to +125 °C T A Range  \n\uf0a7 Device HBM ESD Classification Level H2 \n\uf0a7 Device  CDM ESD Classification Level C5 \n\uf0b7 VIN: 3.8V to 32V \n\uf0b7 3.5A Continuous Output Current  \n\uf0b7 0.8V ±  1% Reference Voltage  \n\uf0b7 22µ A  Low Quiescent Current  (Pulse Frequency Modulation)  \n\uf0b7 450kHz Switching Frequency  \n\uf0b7 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Regardless of Output Load  \n\uf0a7 AP63356Q  \n\uf0b7 Supports Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM)  \n\uf0a7 AP633 57Q \n\uf0a7 Up to 86% Efficiency  at 5mA Light Load  \n\uf0b7 Proprietary Gate Driver Design for Best EMI Reduction  \n\uf0b7 Frequency Spread Spectrum (FSS) to Reduce EMI  \n\uf0b7 Low-Dropout (LDO) Mode  \n\uf0b7 Power Good Indicator with 5MΩ Internal Pull -up \n\uf0b7 Precision Enable Threshold to Adjust UVLO  \n\uf0b7 Protection Circuitry  \n\uf0a7 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)  \n\uf0a7 Output Under voltage Protection ( UVP) \n\uf0a7 Cycle -by-Cycle Peak Current Limit  \n\uf0a7 Thermal Shutdown  \n\uf0b7 Lead -Free Finish;  Fully RoHS Compliant (Notes 1 & 2)  \n\uf0b7 Halogen and Antimony Free. “Green” Device (Note 3)  \n\uf0b7 The AP63 356Q and AP633 57Q are suitable for automotive \napplications requiring specific change control;  these parts \nare AEC-Q100 qualified, PPAP capable, and manufactured in \nIATF 16949 certified facilities.  \nhttps://www.diodes.com/quality/product -definitions/  \n  Pin Assignments  \n567\n4321 9 8SW\nGND\nNC\nBST\nPG COMPFBENVIN\nV-DFN3020 -13/SWP\n(Type A 1)(Top View )\n \n \nApplications  \n\uf0b7 12V Automotive Power Systems  \n\uf0b7 Automotive Infotainment  \n\uf0b7 Automotive Instrument Clusters  \n\uf0b7 Automotive Body Electronics and Lighting  \n\uf0b7 Automotive Telematics  \n\uf0b7 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems  \n \nNotes:  1.

Refer to the block diagram in Figure 4. The device employs  fixed -frequency peak current  mode control. The internal 450kHz clock’s \nrising edge initiates turning on the integrated high -side power MOSFET, Q1, for each cycle. When Q1 is on , the inductor current rises linearly  and \nthe device charges the output capacitor. The current across Q1 is sensed and converted to a voltage with a ratio of R T via the CSA block. The \nCSA output is combined w ith an internal slope compensation, S E, resulting in V SUM. When V SUM rises higher than the COMP node, the device \nturns off Q1 and turns on the low -side power MOSFET, Q2. The inductor current decreases when Q2 is on. On the rising edge of next clock cycle, \nQ2 turns off and Q1 turns on. This sequence repeats every clock cycle.  \n \nThe error amplifier generates the COMP voltage by comparing the voltage on the FB pin with an internal 0.8V reference. An inc rease in load \ncurrent cause s the feedback voltage to drop. The error amplifier thus raises the COMP voltage until the average inductor current matches the \nincreased load current. This feedback loop regulates the output voltage. The internal slope compensation circuitry prevent s subharmonic \noscillation when the dut y cycle is greater than 50% for peak current mode control.  \n \nThe peak current  mode control , integrated  loop compensation network , and built -in 4ms soft -start time simplifies the AP63356Q/AP63357Q  \nfootprint as well as minimizes the external  component count.  \n \nIn order to provide a small output ripple during  light load conditions, the AP63356Q  operates in PWM regardless of output load.  \n \n2 Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM) Operation  \n \nIn heavy load conditions, the AP63357Q  operate s in forced PWM mode. As the load current decreases , the internal COMP node  voltage also \ndecrease s. At a  certain limit, if the load current is low enough, the COMP node  voltage  is clamped and is prevent ed from decreasing any further. \nThe voltage at which COMP is  clamped correspond s to the 700mA PFM peak inductor current limit.  As the load current approaches zero, the \nAP63357Q enter s PFM mode to increase the converter power efficiency at light load conditions. When the inductor current decreases to 0mA, \nzero cross detection circuitry on the low-side power MOSFET, Q2, forces it  off. The buck converter does not sink current from the  output  when the \noutput load is light and while the device is  in PFM . Because  the AP63357Q  work s in PFM  during light load conditions, it  can achieve power \nefficiency of up to 8 6% at a  5mA load condition.  \n \nThe quiescent current of AP63357Q  is 22μA typical under a no-load, non -switching  condition . \n \n3  Enable  \n \nWhen disabled, the device  shutdown supply current is only 1μA. When applying a voltage greater  than the EN logic high  threshold (typical 1.18V,  \nrising), the AP63356Q/AP63357Q enable s all functions  and the device initiates the soft-start phase. The EN pin is a high -voltage pin and can be \ndirectly connected to VIN to automatically start up the device  as VIN increases.  An internal 1.5µ A pull -up current source connected from the \ninternal LDO -regulated VCC to the EN pin guarantees that if EN is left floating, the device still automatically enables once the voltage reaches the \nEN logic high  threshold . The AP63356Q/AP63357Q has a built -in 4ms soft -start time to prevent output voltage overshoot and inrush current. \nWhen the EN voltage falls below its logic low  threshold (typical 1.08 V, falling), the internal  SS voltage discharges to ground and device operatio n \ndisables.  \n \nThe EN pin can also be used to program the undervoltage lockout thresholds. See Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)  section for more details.  \n \n \n  \n \nAP63356Q/AP63357Q   \nDocument number: DS41948 Rev. 1 - 2 14 of 28 \nwww.diodes.com  September 2020  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP63356Q/AP63357Q  \n \n \nApplication Information  (continued)  \n \n4 Electromagnetic Interference ( EMI) Reduction with Ringing -Free Switching Node  and Frequency Spread Spectrum  (FSS)  \n \nIn some applications, the system must meet EMI standards. In relation to high frequency  radiation EMI noise , the switching node’s (SW’s) ringing \namplitude is especially critical.  To dampen high frequency radiated EMI noise, t he AP63356Q/AP63357Q  device implements a proprietary, multi -\nlevel gate driver scheme that achieves a  ringing -free switching node without sacrificing the switching nod e’s rise and fall slew rates as well as  the \nconverter’s power efficie ncy. \n \nTo further improve EMI reduction, the AP663356/AP63357Q device  also implements FSS with a switching frequency jitter of ± 6%. FSS reduces \nconducted and radiated interference at a particular frequency by spreading the switching noise over a wider frequ ency band and by  not allowing \nemitted energy to stay in any one frequency for a significant period of time . \n \n5 Adjusting Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)  \n \nUndervoltage lockout is implemented to prevent the IC from insufficient input voltages. The AP63356Q/AP63357Q  device has a UVLO comparator \nthat monitors the input voltage and the internal bandgap reference. The AP63356Q/AP63357Q disables if  the input voltage falls below 3.08 V. In \nthis UVLO event, both  the high -side and low -side power MOSFETs turn  off. \n \nSome applications may desire higher VIN UVLO threshold voltages than is provided by the default setup. A 4µA hysteresis pull -up current source \non the EN pin  along with an external resistive divider (R3 and R4) configures the VIN UVLO threshold volta ges as shown in Figure 37. \n \nVIN\nR3\nR4ON EN\n1.18VI1\n1.5μAI2\n4μA\n20kΩ \n+\n–\n \nFigure 37.

If the output voltage decreases below its target value by 20%, UVP triggers and PG pull s low until the output returns to its \nset value. The PG rising edge transition is delayed by 1.5ms while the PG falling edge is delayed by 220μs to prevent false triggering.  \n  \n \nAP63356Q/AP63357Q   \nDocument number: DS41948 Rev. 1 - 2 15 of 28 \nwww.diodes.com  September 2020  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP63356Q/AP63357Q  \n \n \nApplication Information  (continued ) \n \n7 Overcurrent Protection  (OCP)  \n \nThe AP63356Q/AP63357Q  has cycle -by-cycle peak current limit protection by  sensing the current through the internal high -side power MOSFET , \nQ1. While Q1 is on, the internal sensing circuitry monitors its conduction current. Once the current through Q1 exceeds the peak current limit, Q1 \nimmediately turns off. If Q1 consistently hits the peak current limit for 512 cycles, the buck converter enters hiccup mod e and shuts down. After \n8192 cycles of down time, the buck converter restarts powering up. Hiccup mode reduces the power dissipation in the overcurre nt condition.  \n \n8 Thermal Shutdown (TSD)  \n \nIf the junction temperature of the device reaches the thermal shutdown limit of +170° C, the AP63356Q/AP63357Q  shuts down both its high -side \nand low -side power MOSFETs. When the junction temperature reduces to the required level ( +145° C typical), the device  initiates a normal power -\nup cycle with soft -start.  \n \n9 Power Derating Characteristics  \n \nTo prevent the regulator from exceeding the maximum recommended operating junction temperature, some thermal analysis is requ ired.

The actual junction temperature should not exceed the maximum \nrecommended opera ting junction temperature of +150° C when co nsidering the thermal design.

An optional external capacitor, C4 \nin Figure 1,  of 10pF to 220pF  improves the transient response. The resistor values of the feedback network are selected based on a design trade -\noff between efficiency and output voltage accuracy. There is less current consumption in the feedback network  for high resistor values, which \nimproves efficiency at light loads . However, values too high cause the device to be more susceptible to noise affecting its output voltage accuracy.  \nR1 can be determined by the following equation:  \n \n 𝐑𝟏=𝐑𝟐∙(𝐕𝐎𝐔𝐓\n𝟎.𝟖𝐕−𝟏) Eq. 5 \n \nTable 1 shows a list of recommended component selections  for common AP63356Q/AP63357Q output voltages  referencing Figure 39 using \ninternal compensation.  \n \nAP63356 Q\nAP63357 QVIN\nEN SWBST\nFB\nGNDPG COMPR1  C4\nR2LC3\nC2OUTPUTINPUT\nC1  \nFigure 39.

For most designs, the following equation c an be used to calculate \nthe inductor value:  \n \n 𝐋=𝐕𝐎𝐔𝐓 ∙(𝐕𝐈𝐍 −𝐕𝐎𝐔𝐓 )\n𝐕𝐈𝐍 ∙∆𝐈𝐋∙𝐟𝐬𝐰 Eq. 6 \n \nWhere:  \n\uf0b7 ∆IL is the inductor current ripple  \n\uf0b7 fSW is the buck converter switching frequency  \n \nFor AP63356Q/AP63357Q , choose ∆I L to be 30% to 50% of the maximum load current of 3.5A. \n \nThe inductor peak current is calculated by:  \n \n 𝐈𝐋𝐏𝐄𝐀𝐊=𝐈𝐋𝐎𝐀𝐃 +∆𝐈𝐋\n𝟐 Eq. 7 \n \nPeak current determines the required saturation current rating, which influences the size of the inductor. Saturating the ind uctor decreases the \nconverter efficiency while increasing the temperatures of the inductor and the internal power MOSFETs. Therefor e, choosing an inductor with the \nappropriate saturation current rating is important. For most applications, it is recommended to select an inductor of approx imately 2.2µ H to 10 µ H \nwith a DC current rating of at least 35% higher than the maximum load current . For highest efficiency, the inductor’s DC resistance should be less \nthan 30mΩ. Use a larger inductance for improved efficiency under light load conditions.  \n \n  \n \nAP63356Q/AP63357Q   \nDocument number: DS41948 Rev. 1 - 2 18 of 28 \nwww.diodes.com  September 2020  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP63356Q/AP63357Q  \n \n \nApplication Information  (continued ) \n \n12 Input Capacitor  \n \nThe input capacitor reduces both the surge current drawn from the input supply as well as the switching noise from the device. The input capacitor  \nmust sustain the ripple  current produced during the on -time of Q1. It must have a low ESR to minimize power dissipation due to the RMS input \ncurrent.  \n \nThe RMS current rating of the input capacitor is a critical parameter and must be higher than the RMS input current. As a rul e of thumb, select an \ninput capacitor with an  RMS current rating greater than half of the maximum load current.  \n \nDue to la rge dI/dt through the input capa citor, electrolytic or ceramic capacitors  with low ESR should be used. If using a tantalum capacitor , it must \nbe surge protected or else capacitor failure could occur. Using a ceramic capacitor of 10µ F or greater is sufficient for most applications.  \n \n13 Output Capacitor  \n \nThe output capacito r keeps the output voltage ripple small, ensures feedback loop stability, and reduces both the overshoot s and undershoot s of \nthe output voltage during load transients. During the first few micro seconds of a n increasing  load transient, the converter recognizes the change \nfrom steady -state and enters 100% duty cycle to supply more current to the load. However, the inductor limits the change to increasing cu rrent \ndepending on its indu ctance. Therefore, the output capacitor supplies the difference in current to the load during this time . Likewise, d uring the first \nfew microseconds of a decreasing load transient, the converter recognizes the change from steady -state and sets the on -time to minimum to \nreduce the current supplied to the load. However, the inductor limits the change in decreasing current as well. Therefore, th e output capacitor \nabsorbs the excess current from the inductor during this time.  \n \nThe effective output capacitance, COUT , requirements can be  calculated from the equations below . \n \nThe ESR of the output capacitor dominates the output voltage ripple. The amount of ripple can be calculated by: \n \n 𝐕𝐎𝐔𝐓 𝐑𝐢𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐞 = ∆𝐈𝐋∙(𝐄𝐒𝐑 +𝟏\n𝟖∙𝐟𝐬𝐰∙𝐂𝐎𝐔𝐓) Eq. 8 \n \nAn output capacitor with large capacitance and low ESR is the best option. For most applications, a 22µ F to 68µ F ceramic capacitor is s ufficient. \nTo meet the load transient requirement s, the calculated COUT should satisfy the following inequality:  \n \n 𝐂𝐎𝐔𝐓 >𝐦𝐚𝐱 (𝐋∙𝐈𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝟐\n∆𝐕𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐭 ∙𝐕𝐎𝐔𝐓,𝐋∙𝐈𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝟐\n∆𝐕𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐭 ∙(𝐕𝐈𝐍 −𝐕𝐎𝐔𝐓 )) Eq. 9 \n \nWhere:  \n\uf0b7 ITrans is the load transient  \n\uf0b7 ∆VOvershoot  is the maximum output overshoot voltage  \n\uf0b7 ∆VUndershoot  is the maximum output undershoot  voltage  \n \n14 Bootstrap Capacitor  and Low -Dropout (LDO) Operation  \n \nTo ensure proper operation, a ceramic capacitor must be connected between the BST and SW pins  to supply the drive voltage for the high -side \npower MOSFET . A 100nF ceramic capacitor is sufficient.  If the bootstrap  capacitor voltage falls below 2.3V, the boot undervoltage protection \ncircuit turns Q2 on for 220ns to refresh the bootstrap  capacitor and raise its voltage back above 2.85V. The bootstrap  capacitor voltage threshold \nis always maintained t o ensure enough driving capability for Q1. This operation may arise during long periods of no switching such as in PFM with \nlight load conditions. Another event that requires the refreshing of the bootstrap  capacitor is when the input voltage drops close t o the output \nvoltage. Under this condition, the regulator enters low -dropout mode by holding Q1 on for multiple clock cycles. To prevent the bootstrap  capacitor \nfrom discharging, Q2 is forced to refresh. The effective duty cycle is approximately 100% so th at it acts as an LDO to maintain the output voltage \nregulation.  \n \n  \n \nAP63356Q/AP63357Q   \nDocument number: DS41948 Rev. 1 - 2 19 of 28 \nwww.diodes.com  September 2020  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP63356Q/AP63357Q  \n \n \nApplication Information  (continued)  \n \n15 External Loop Compensation Design  \n \nWhen the COMP pin is not connected to GND, the COMP pin is active for external loop compensation. The regulator uses a consta nt frequency, \npeak current mode control architecture to achieve a fast loop response. The inductor is not considered as a state var iable since its peak current is \nconstant . Thus, t he system becomes a single -order system . For loop stabilization, i t is simpler to design a Type II compensator for current mode \ncontrol than it is to design a Type III compensator for voltage mode control.  Peak current  mode control has an inherent input voltage feed -forward  \nfunction to achieve good line regulation.
