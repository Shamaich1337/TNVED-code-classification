The \nLT8652S uses second generation Silent Switcher technol -\nogy including integrated bypass capacitors to deliver a \nhigh frequency, high efficiency, small solution with excel -\nlent EMI performance. The LT8652S is ideal for noise \nsensitive applications such as PLLs and high bandwidth \ndata and communications systems.\nThe fast, clean, low overshoot switching edges enable \nhigh efficiency operation even at high switching frequen -\ncies, enabling a wide control loop bandwidth for fast tran -\nsient response. Output current monitoring and limiting \nallows inductors to be selected for the maximum output current in a given application. Differential output voltage sensing provides accurate voltage regulation at the point of load for high current applications. The two channels can be combined to deliver 17A, and two LT8652S ICs can be combined for a 4-phase, 34A supply.\n3.3V/8.5A, 1.0V/8.5A 1.5MHz Step-Down Converter Efficiency nSilent Switcher®2 Architecture: \n nUltralow EMI on Any PCB\n nEliminates PCB Layout Sensitivity\n nInternal Bypass Capacitors Reduce Radiated EMI\n nSpread Spectrum Frequency Modulation\n n8.5A DC from Each Channel Simultaneously\n nUp to 12A on Either Channel\n nUltralow Quiescent Current Burst Mode® Operation:\n n16µA  IQ Regulating 12V IN to 3.3V OUT (Both Channels)\n nOutput Ripple <10mV P-P \n n±1.2% 600mV Feedback Voltage with Remote Sense\n nOutput Current Monitor Pins with Current Limiting\n nForced Continuous Mode\n nCLKOUT for Up to 4-Phase Operation\n n93.6% Efficiency at 6A, 3.3V OUT from 12V IN at\xa01MHz\n n85.6% Efficiency at 6A, 1.0V OUT from 12V IN at\xa01MHz\n nFast Minimum Switch-On Time: 20ns\n nAdjustable and Synchronizable: 300kHz to 3MHz\n nSmall 4mm  × 7mm  36-Pin LQFN Package\n nAEC-Q100 Qualified for Automotive Applications\nAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: The LT8652SE is guaranteed to meet performance specifications \nfrom 0°C to 125°C junction temperature. Specifications over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The LT8652SI is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. High junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes. Operating lifetime is derated at junction temperatures greater than 125°C. The junction temperature (T\nJ, in °C) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A, in °C) and power dissipation (P D, in watts) \naccording to the formula:  \n  TJ = TA + (P D • θJA), where θ JA (in °C/W) is the package thermal  \n impedance.\nNote 3:\n This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended to \nprotect the device during overload conditions. Junction temperature will exceed 150°C when overtemperature protection is active. Continuous operation above the specified maximum operating junction temperature will reduce lifetime. \nLOAD CURRENT (A)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\nEFFICIENCY (%)\nPOWER LOSS (W)\n8652S G01\nEFFICIENCY\nPOWER LOSS\nL = XEL4030\nBIAS = 5VFCM1MHz, L = 0.47µH1.5MHz, L = 0.3µH2MHz, L = 0.2µH\nLOAD CURRENT (A)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\nEFFICIENCY (%)\nPOWER LOSS (W)\n8652S G04\nEFFICIENCY\nPOWER LOSS\nL = XEL4030BIAS = 5VFCM1MHz, L = 0.47µH1.5MHz, L = 0.3µH2MHz, L = 0.2µH5.0V IN to 1.0V OUT Efficiency\n1.0V OUT Efficiency—Burst Mode \nOperation\nLOAD CURRENT (A)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\nEFFICIENCY (%)\nPOWER LOSS (W)\n8652S G02\nEFFICIENCY\nPOWER LOSSL = XEL4030FCM 1MHz, L = 0.47µH1.5MHz, L = 0.3µH2MHz, L = 0.2µH\nL = XEL4030–301ME, 0.3µH\nBIAS = 5V\n5VIN\n12VIN\nLOAD CURRENT (mA)\n1\n10\n100\n1k\n10k\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nEFFICIENCY (%)\n8652S G03\nLT8652S\n5\nRev.

B For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS\nIMON2 (Pin 1):  Channel 2 Average Output Current Monitor \nPin. A current proportional to the average output current \nflows out of this pin. An error amplifier compares the volt -\nage on this pin to 1.0V (typical) and regulates the average \ncurrent as required based on the external resistor value \nfrom this pin to GND. Selecting the external resistor value \nallows the user to control the maximum average output \ncurrent such that:\n RIMON = 78,000/I LIM\nIf IMON2 pin functionality is not desired, tie this pin to GND. See the Applications Information section for more details.\nSS2 (Pin 2):  Channel 2 Output T racking and Soft-Start \nPin. This pin allows user control of output voltage ramp \nrate during start-up. A SS2 voltage below 0.6V forces \nthe LT8652S to regulate the FB2 pin to equal the SS2 pin voltage. When SS2 is above 0.6V, the internal reference \nresumes control of the error amplifier . An internal 2μA  \npull-up current from V CC on this pin allows a capacitor \nto program output voltage slew rate. This pin is pulled \nto ground with a 200Ω MOSFET during shutdown and \nfault conditions;  use a series resistor if driving from a \nlow impedance output. This pin may be left floating if the soft-start feature is not being used.\nRT (Pin 3): A resistor is tied between RT and ground to \nset the switching frequency.\nV\nIN1 (Pins 5, 6, 7): The V IN1 pins supply current to the \nLT8652S internal circuitry and to the internal top side \npower switch of Channel 1. These pins must be locally \nbypassed. Be sure to place the positive terminal of the \ninput capacitor as close as possible to the V IN1 pins and \nthe negative capacitor terminal as close as possible to the \nGND pins. V IN1 must be greater than 3V for the LT8652S \nto operate. \nNC (Pin 8) : No Connect. This pin is not connected to \ninternal circuitry. It is recommended that this be left float -\ning or tied to GND.VIN2 (Pin 9, 10, 11): The V IN2 pins supply current to the \ninternal top side power switch of Channel 2. These pins \nmust be locally bypassed. Be sure to place the positive terminal of the input capacitor as close as possible to the V\nIN2 pins and the negative capacitor terminal as close as \npossible to the GND pins. This input is capable of operat-ing from a different supply than V\nIN1. VIN1 must be pres-\nent to run channel 2.\nEN/UV (Pin 13):  The LT8652S is shutdown when this \npin is low and active when this pin is high. The hyster -\netic threshold voltage is 0.82V going up and 0.80V going \ndown. Tie to V IN1 if shutdown feature is not used. An \nexternal resistor divider from V IN1 can be used to program \na VIN threshold below which Channel 1 and Channel 2 of \nthe LT8652S will shut down. Do not float this pin. For \nindividual channel shutdown, pull that channel’ s soft start \npin to GND.\nTEMP (Pin 14):  Temperature Output Pin. This pin outputs \na voltage proportional to junction temperature. The pin is 250mV for 25°C and has a slope of 11mV/°C. The output of this pin is not valid during light output loads on both \nchannels while in Burst Mode operation. Put the LT8652S \nin forced continuous mode for the TEMP output to be valid \nacross the entire output load range. See the Applications Information section for more information.\nPG2 (Pin 15): The PG2 pin is the open-drain output of an \ninternal comparator . PG2 remains low until the FB2 pin is \nwithin ±7% of the final regulation voltage and there are no \nfault conditions. PG2 is pulled low during V IN1 UVLO, V CC \nUVLO, Thermal Shutdown or when the EN/UV pin is low.\nPG1 (Pin 16): The PG1 pin is the open-drain output of an \ninternal comparator .

Apply a DC voltage of 2.8V or higher or \ntie to V CC for forced continuous mode with spread spec-\ntrum modulation. Float the SYNC pin for forced continu -\nous mode without spread spectrum modulation. When in forced continuous mode, the I\nQ will increase to several \nmA. Apply a clock source to the SYNC pin for synchro -\nnization to an external frequency. The LT8652S will be in forced \ncontinuous mode when an external frequency is \napplied.\nCLKOUT (Pin 18) : In forced continuous mode, the \nCLKOUT pin provides a 50% duty cycle square wave 90 \ndegrees out of phase with Channel 1. This allows syn -\nchronization with other regulators with up to four phases. \nWhen an external clock is applied to the SYNC pin, the \nCLKOUT pin will output a waveform with the same phase, \nduty cycle and frequency as the SYNC waveform. In Burst \nMode operation, the CLKOUT pin will be grounded.

This pin allows user control of output voltage ramp \nrate during start-up. A SS1 voltage below 0.6V forces \nthe LT8652S to regulate the FB1 pin to equal the SS1 pin voltage. When SS1 is above 0.6V, the tracking function is disabled and the internal reference resumes control of the error amplifier . An internal 2μA pull-up current from \nVCC on this pin allows a capacitor to program output volt -\nage slew rate.

B For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nForeword\nThe LT8652S is a dual monolithic step-down regula -\ntor . The two channels are the same in terms of current \ncapability and power switch size. The following sections \ndescribe the operation of Channel\xa01 and common circuits. \nThey will highlight Channel\xa02 differences and interactions \nonly when relevant. To simplify the application, both V IN1 \nand V IN2 are assumed to be connected to the same input \nsupply. However , note that V IN1 must be greater than 3.0V  \nfor either channel to operate.\nOperation\nThe LT8652S is a dual monolithic, constant frequency, \npeak current mode step-down DC/DC converter . An oscil -\nlator , with frequency set using a resistor on the RT pin, \nturns on the internal top power switch at the beginning of \neach clock cycle. Current in the inductor then increases \nuntil the top switch current comparator trips and turns off \nthe top power switch. The peak inductor current at which \nthe top switch turns off is controlled by the voltage on \nthe VC node. The error amplifier servos the VC node by \ncomparing the voltage on the V FB pin with an internal 0.6V \nreference. When the load current increases it causes a \nreduction in the feedback voltage relative to the reference \nleading the error amplifier to raise the VC voltage until the \naverage inductor current matches the new load current. \nWhen the top power switch turns off, the synchronous \npower switch turns on until the next clock cycle begins or \ninductor current falls to zero when not in forced continu -\nous mode (FCM). If overload conditions result in more \nthan the bottom NMOS current limit flowing through the bottom switch, the next clock cycle will be delayed until switch current returns to a safe level.\nThe “S” in LT8652S refers to the second generation \nSilent Switcher technology. This technology allows fast switching edges for high efficiency at high switching fre -\nquencies, while simultaneously achieving good EMI/EMC \nperformance. This includes the integration of ceramic \ncapacitors into the package for V IN1, VIN2, VCC, BST1, \nand BST2 (C1– C5 in the Block Diagram). These capacitors \nkeep all the fast AC current loops small which improves EMI performance. The output voltage is resistively divided externally to cre -\nate a feedback voltage for the regulator . In high current operation, a ground offset may be present between the LT8652 S local ground and ground at the load. T\no over -\ncome this offset, SNSGND should have a Kelvin connec -\ntion to the load ground, and the lowest potential node of \nthe resistor divider should be connected to SNSGND. The \ninternal error amplifier senses the difference between this \nfeedback voltage and a 0.6V SNSGND referenced volt -\nage. This scheme overcomes any ground offsets between \nlocal ground and remote output ground, resulting in a \nmore accurate output voltage. The LT8652 S allows for \nremote output ground deviations as much as ± 300mV  \nwith respect to local ground.\nIf the EN/UV pin is low, both channels are fully shut down \nand the LT8652S draws 6µA from the input supply. When \nthe EN/UV pin is above 0.82V, both channels’ switching \nregulators will become active. 16μA is supplied by V IN1 \nto common bias circuits for both channels.\nEach channel can independently enter Burst Mode opera -\ntion to optimize efficiency at light load. Between bursts, all circuitry associated with controlling the output switch \nis shut down, reducing the channel’ s contribution to input \nsupply current. In a typical application, 17μA will be con -\nsumed from the input supply when regulating both chan -\nnels with no load. Ground the SYNC pin for Burst Mode operation, float it for for ced continuous mode (FCM) or \napply a DC voltage higher than 2.8V  to use FCM with \nspread spectrum modulation (SSM). If a clock is applied \nto the SYNC pin, both channels will synchronize to the \nexternal clock frequency and operate in FCM. While in \nFCM, the oscillator operates continuously and rising SW \ntransitions are aligned to the clock. During light loads, \nthe inductor current is allowed to go negative to maintain the programmed switching frequency. Minimum current \nlimits for both power switches are enforced to prevent \nlarge negative inductor current from flowing back to the \ninput. SSM dithers the switching frequency from the pro -\ngrammed value set by the RT pin up to 20% higher than \nthe programmed value to spread out the switching energy \nin the frequency domain. The CLKOUT pin has no output \nLT8652S\n17\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nin Burst Mode operation, but outputs a square wave 90 \ndegrees phase shifted from Channel\xa01 when in FCM. If a clock is applied to the SYNC pin, the CLKOUT pin has the same phase and duty cycle as the external clock.\nTo improve efficiency across all loads, supply current to \ninternal circuitry can be sourced from the BIAS pin when biased at 3.3V or above. Otherwise, the internal circuitry \nwill draw current exclusively from V IN1. The BIAS pin \nshould be connected to the lowest V OUT programmed at \n3.3V or above.\nThe VC pin allows the loop compensation of the switch -\ning regulator to be optimized based on the programmed \nswitching frequency. Internal compensation can be \nselected by connecting the VC pin to V CC, which simplifies \nthe application circuit. External compensation improves \nthe transient response at the expense of about 100µA  \nmore quiescent current per channel.\nThe LT8652S provides a scaled replica of the average \nChannel\xa01 and Channel\xa02 output current at the IMON1  \nand IMON2 pins respectively. The average current at each \nof these pins will be 1/78,000th of the measured average \ncurrent plus a sampling offset. Further , the voltage at each \npin is continuously fed to independent current limit ampli -\nfiers that have a voltage reference at 1V. Thus, a program -\nmable average current limit for the output current may be \nobtained by placing a resistor of suitable value from IMON \nto GND so as to produce 1V at the desired current limit. When the current limit feature is used, a compensation \ncapacitor should not be placed in parallel with the cho -\nsen resistor . The output monitor and limit circuits may be individually disabled by shorting IMON to GND.\nComparators monitoring the FB pin voltage will pull the \ncorresponding PG pin low if the output voltage varies \nmore than ±7% (typical) from the regulation voltage or if \na fault condition is present. \nThe voltage present at the TEMP pin is proportional to \nthe average die temperature of the LT8652S. The TEMP \npin will be 250mV for a die temperature of 25°C and will have a slope of 11mV/°C.\nT racking soft-start is implemented by providing constant \ncurrent via the SS/TR pin to an external soft-start capaci -\ntor to generate a voltage ramp. FB voltage is regulated to the voltage at the SS pin until it exceeds 0.6V;\n FB is then \nregulated to the reference 0.6V. When the SS pin is below \n40mV, the corresponding switching regulator will stop \nswitching. The SS capacitor is reset during shutdown, \nVIN1 undervoltage, or thermal shutdown.\nBoth channels are designed for output currents up to 12A, \nbut thermal considerations practically limit the output cur -\nrents to 8.5A of continuous current from each channel \nsimultaneously. Channel 1 has a minimum V IN1 require-\nment of 3.0V, Channel\xa02 can operate with no minimum V\nIN2 provided the minimum V IN1 has been satisfied.\nLT8652S\n18\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAchieving Ultralow Quiescent Current\nTo enhance efficiency at light loads, the LT8652S oper -\nates in low ripple Burst Mode operation, which keeps the \noutput capacitor charged to the desired output voltage \nwhile minimizing the input quiescent current and mini -\nmizing output voltage ripple. 16μA is supplied by V IN1 \nto common bias circuits. In Burst Mode operation, the \nLT8652S delivers single small pulses of current to the \noutput capacitor followed by sleep periods where the out -\nput power is supplied by the output capacitor . While in \nsleep mode, both channels consume a combined 16μA.\nAs the output load decreases, the frequency of single cur -\nrent pulses decreases (see Figure\xa01) and the percentage \nof time the LT8652S is in sleep mode increases, result -\ning in much higher light load efficiency than for typical converters. By maximizing the time between pulses, the converter quiescent current approaches 16µA \n for a typi -\ncal application when there is no output load. Therefore, \nto optimize the quiescent current performance at light \nloads, the current in the feedback resistor divider must be minimized as it appears to the output as load current.\nFigure\xa01. \nLOAD CURRENT (A)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n2.00\n2.25\n2.50\nSWITCHING FREQUENCY (MHz)\n8652S F01\nVIN1 = 12V\nVOUT = 1V\nSYNC = 0V\nRT = 20k/uni03A9\nL = 0.2µH Burst Frequency\nWhile in Burst Mode operation, the current limit of the \ntop switch is approximately 3A resulting in output voltage \nripple shown in Figure\xa02.

See Forced Continuous Mode\xa0section.\nFB Resistor Network and Differential Output Sensing\nThe output voltage is programmed with an external \nresistor divider from the output to its SNSGND (R1–2 for \nChannel\xa01, R3–4 for Channel\xa02). The resistive divider is tapped by the FB pin. Choose the resistor values accord -\ning to:\n R1=R2VOUT1\n0.6V–1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nReference designators refer to the Block Diagram. \n1% resistors or better are recommended to maintain \noutput voltage accuracy. More precisely, the V OUT value \nprogrammed in the previous equation is with respect to \nSNSGND and thus is a differential quantity. For example, if \nVOUT is programmed to 3V and V SNSGND  is –0.1V, then the \noutput will be 2.9V with respect to ground at the LT8652S. \nLT8652S\n19\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nDifferential output sensing allows for more accurate out -\nput regulation in high power distributed systems hav -\ning large line losses. Figure\xa03 illustrates the potential \nvariations in the power and ground lines due to parasitic \nelements. These variations are exacerbated in multi-\napplication systems with shared ground planes. Without \ndifferential output sensing, these variations directly reflect \nas an error in the regulated output voltage. The LT8652S’s \ndifferential output sensing can correct for up to ±300mV \nof variation in the output’s power and ground lines.\nThe LT8652 S allows for seamless differential output sens -\ning by sensing the resistively divided feedback voltage \ndifferentially. This allows for differential sensing in the \nfull output range from 0.6V to 18V.\nTo avoid noise coupling into FB, the resistor divider should \nbe placed near the FB and SNSGND pins and physically \nclose to the LT8652S. The remote output and ground \ntraces should be routed together as a differential pair to the remote output. These traces should be terminated as \nclose as physically possible to the remote output point \nthat is to be accurately regulated through remote differ -\nential sensing.\nIf low input quiescent current and good light-load effi -\nciency are desired, use large resistor values for the FB resistor divider .

For a 1.2V appli -\ncation with R1 = 1M and \n R2 = 1M, the feedback divider \ndraws 0.6µA. With V IN = 12V and h =  80%, this adds 75nA  \nto the 16µA quiescent current resulting in 16.075µA no-load current from the 12V supply. Note that this equation \nimplies that the no-load current is a function of V IN; this is \nplotted in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nA similar calculation can be done to determine the input current contribution from the Channel\xa02 feedback resis -\ntors.

The advantage of high frequency operation is that smaller inductor and capacitor values may be used. The \ndisadvantages are lower efficiency and a smaller input \nvoltage\xa0range. APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe highest switching frequency (f SW(MAX) ) for a given \napplication can be calculated as follows:\n  fSW MAX( )=VOUT+VSW BOT()\ntON MIN( )VIN– VSW TOP()+VSW BOT() ( )\nwhere V IN is the typical input voltage, V OUT is the output \nvoltage, V SW(TOP)  and V SW(BOT)  are the internal switch \ndrops (~ 0.3V, ~0.1V, respectively at maximum load) and \ntON(MIN)  is the minimum top switch on-time of 45nS (see \nthe Electrical Characteristics). This equation shows that a \nslower switching frequency is necessary to accommodate a \nhigh V IN/VOUT ratio. Choose the switching frequency based \non which channel has the lower frequency constraint.\nFor transient operation, V IN may go as high as the abso-\nlute maximum rating of 18V regardless of the R T value, \nhowever the LT8652S will reduce switching frequency \non each channel independently as necessary to maintain \ncontrol of inductor current to assure safe operation.\nIn Burst Mode operation, the LT8652S is capable of a \nmaximum duty cycle of greater than 99%, and the V IN to \nVOUT dropout is limited by the R DS(ON)  of the top switch. \nIn this mode the channel that enters dropout skips switch \ncycles, resulting in a lower switching frequency. The \nLT8652S in forced continuous mode will not skip cycles to achieve a higher duty cycle. The part will maintain the programmed switching frequency and the dropout volt -\nage will be larger due to the smaller maximum duty cycle.\nFor applications that cannot allow deviation from the pro -\ngrammed switching frequency at low V IN/VOUT ratios, use \nthe following formula to set switching frequency: \n  VIN MIN( )=VOUT+VSW BOT()\n1– fSW• tOFF MIN( )– VSW BOT()+VSW TOP()\nwhere V IN(MIN)  is the minimum input voltage without \nskipped cycles, V OUT is the output voltage, V SW(TOP)  and \nVSW(BOT)  are the internal switch drops (~ 0.3V, ~0.1V, \nrespectively at maximum load), f SW is the switching \nfrequency (set by RT), and t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum \nswitch off-time. Note that higher switching frequency will \nincrease the minimum input voltage below which cycles will be dropped to achieve higher duty cycle.\nLT8652S\n21\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nNote there is no minimum V IN2 voltage requirement as it \ndoes not supply the internal common bias circuits, mak -\ning the Channel\xa02 uniquely capable of operating from very \nlow input voltages as long as V IN1 has a supply of 3V or \ngreater .\nInductor Selection and Maximum Output Current\nThe LT8652S is designed to minimize solution size by \nallowing the inductor to be chosen based on the output \nload requirements of the application. During overload or \nshort-circuit conditions, the LT8652S safely tolerates \noperation with a saturated inductor through the use of a high speed peak-current mode architecture.\nA good first choice for the inductor value is:\n  L1 ,2=VOUT1 ,2+VSW BOT()\n3 • fSW\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency in MHz, V OUT is \nthe output voltage, V SW(BOT)  is the bottom switch drop \n(~0.1V) and L is the inductor value in μH. To avoid over -\nheating and poor efficiency, an inductor must be chosen \nwith an RMS current rating that is greater than the maxi -\nmum expected output load of the application. In addition, the saturation current (typically labeled I\nSAT) rating of the \ninductor must be higher than the load current plus 1/2 of in inductor ripple current:\n  IL PEAK( )=ILOAD MAX( )+1\n2∆IL\nwhere ∆I L is the inductor ripple current as calculated in \nEquation 1 and I LOAD(MAX)  is the maximum output load \nfor a given application.\nAs a quick example, an application requiring 7A output \nshould use an inductor with an RMS rating of greater than \n7A and an I SAT of greater than 9.1A. During long duration \noverload or short-circuit conditions, the inductor RMS rat -\ning requirement must be greater to avoid overheating of \nthe inductor . To keep the efficiency high, the series resis -\ntance (DCR) should be less than 3mΩ and the core mate -\nrial should be intended for high frequency\xa0applications.The LT8652S limits the peak switch current in order to \nprotect the switches and the system from overload faults. \nThe top switch current limit (I LIM) is at least 29A at low \nduty cycles and decreases linearly to 19A at DC =  0.8. \nThe inductor value must then be sufficient to supply the desired maximum output current (I\nOUT(MAX) ), which is a \nfunction of the switch current limit (I LIM) and the ripple \ncurrent.\n  IOUT MAX( )=ILIM–∆IL\n2\nThe peak-to-peak ripple current in the inductor can be \ncalculated as follows:\n ∆IL=VOUT\nL • fSW• 1–VOUT\nVIN MAX( )⎛\n⎝⎜⎜⎞\n⎠⎟⎟ (1)\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency of the LT8652S and \nL is the value of the inductor . Therefore, the maximum \noutput current that the LT8652S will deliver depends on \nthe switch current limit, the inductor value, and the input and output voltages. \nEach channel has a secondary bottom switch current limit. After the top switch has turned off, the bottom \nswitch carries the inductor current. If for any reason the \ninductor current is too high, the bottom switch will remain \non, delaying the top switch turning on until the inductor current returns to a safe level. This level is specified as \nthe bottom NMOS current limit and is independent of duty \ncycle. Maximum output current in the application circuit is \nlimited to this valley current plus one half of the inductor ripple current.\nIn most cases, current limit is enforced by the top switch. \nThe bottom switch limit controls the inductor current \nwhen the minimum on-time condition is violated (high \ninput voltage, high frequency or saturated inductor).\nThe bottom switch current limit is designed to be equal \nto the peak current limit to avoid any contribution to \nmaximum rated current of the LT8652 S.\nFor more information about maximum output current and \ndiscontinuous operation, see Analog Devices Application \nNote 44.\nLT8652S\n22\nRev.

The average current at the \nmonitor pin is 1/78000th the measured average output \ncurrent plus a sampling offset inversely proportional to the switch off-time:\n  IIMON=IOUT\n0.078+1\ntOFF\n tOFF=1–VOUT\nVIN⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nfSW\nwhere f SW is the programmed switching frequency mea -\nsured in MHz, t OFF is the switch off-time measured in \nmicroseconds, I OUT is the output current in amps, and \nIIMON is in microamps.\nThe output current may be measured directly or con -\nverted to a voltage with an external resistor . The voltages \nat the IMON pins are continuously fed to independent \ncurrent limit amplifiers that have a voltage reference of \n1V (typical). A programmable average current limit for \neither channels’ average output current may be obtained \nby placing a resistor , R IMON, from the monitor pin to GND \naccording to the following equation:\n  RIMON=78,000\nILIMAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nwhere I LIM is the programmed current limit in amps and \nRIMON is in ohms. It is recommended to set the pro -\ngrammed average current limit to allow for at least 10% margin.\nWhen active, the current limit amplifiers form a feedback \nloop that controls the maximum average current pro -\nduced by the LT8652S. In current limit the output volt -\nage drops, resulting in frequency stretching to maintain a \ndecreased duty-cycle. This results in the sampling offset \nterm becoming negligible in current limit. When using \nthe current limit feature, a capacitor should not be placed \nbetween GND and the monitor pin, otherwise loop stability \ncould be adversely effected. However , if high frequency \nnoise reduction is desired a capacitor may be placed in parallel with R\nIMON if:\n RIMON • CFIL TER < 3.2μs\nThis will ensure the pole created by the filter capacitor \nand R IMON will not affect the current limit feedback loop. \nDo not use a R IMON greater than 80kΩ. \nWhen operating in BURST mode (SYNC low), if the load \nis low enough that the switching frequency starts to \ndecrease, then IMON will cease to monitor output cur -\nrent and will instead pull the IMON voltage to ground. \nAs previously described, the LT8652S senses the average \noutput current through the bottom FET during the off time. \nAs a result, it is recommended the LT8652S be operated \nwith an off time of greater than 150ns for best current \nmonitor accuracy. For many applications, this is of little \nconcern unless operating at or near regulator dropout \nconditions (extremely high duty cycle operation).\nInput Capacitor\nBypass the input of the LT8652S circuit with a ceramic \ncapacitor of X7R or X5R type placed as close as possible \nto the V IN and GND pins. Y5V types have poor perfor -\nmance over temperature and applied voltage, and should not be used. A 10μF or higher value ceramic capacitor is adequate to bypass the LT8652S and will easily handle \nthe ripple current. Note that larger input capacitance is \nrequired when a lower switching frequency is used. If \nthe input power source has high impedance, or there is \nLT8652S\n23\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nsignificant inductance due to long wires or cables, addi -\ntional bulk capacitance may be necessary. This can be \nprovided with a low performance electrolytic capacitor .\nOutput Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor has two essential functions. Along \nwith the inductor , it filters the square wave generated by \nthe LT8652 S to produce the DC output. In this role, it \ndetermines the output ripple, thus low impedance at the \nswitching frequency is important. The second function \nis to store energy in order to satisfy transient loads and stabilize the LT8652S’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors \nhave very low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and \nprovide the best ripple performance. For good starting \nvalues, see the Typical Applications section.\nUse X5R or X7R types. This choice will provide low out -\nput ripple and good transient response. T ransient perfor -\nmance can be improved with a higher value output capaci-\ntor and the addition of a feed forward capacitor placed \nbetween V OUT and FB. Increasing the output capacitance \nwill also decrease the output voltage ripple. A lower value \nof output capacitor can be used to save space and cost but transient performance will suffer and may cause loop instability. See the Typical Applications in this data sheet for suggested capacitor values.\nWhen choosing a capacitor, special attention should be \ngiven to the data sheet to calculate the effective capaci -\ntance under the relevant operating conditions of voltage \nbias and temperature. A physically larger capacitor or one \nwith a higher voltage rating may be required.\nCeramic Capacitors\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However , ceramic capacitors can cause problems \nwhen used with the LT8652S due to their piezoelectric \nnature. When in Burst Mode operation, the LT8652S’s \nswitching frequency depends on the load current, and \nat very light loads the LT8652S can excite the ceramic \ncapacitor at audio frequencies, generating audible noise. \nSince the LT8652S operates at a lower current limit during \nBurst Mode operation, the noise is typically very quiet to a \ncasual ear . If this is unacceptable, use a high performance tantalum or electrolytic capacitor at the output. Low noise \nceramic capacitors are also available.\nTable\xa03.

The rising threshold of \nthe EN/UV comparator is 0.83V, with 30mV of hysteresis. \nThe EN/UV pins can be tied to V IN if the shutdown feature \nis not used, or tied to a logic level if shutdown control \nis\xa0required.\nAdding a resistor divider from V IN to EN/UV programs \nthe LT8652S to operate only when V IN is above a desired \nvoltage (see the Block Diagram). Typically, this threshold, \nVIN(EN) , is used in situations where the input supply is \ncurrent limited or has a relatively high source resistance. \nA switching regulator draws constant power from the \nsource, so source current increases as source voltage \ndrops. This looks like a negative resistance load to the \nsource and can cause the source to current limit or latch \nlow under low source voltage conditions. The V IN(EN)  \nthreshold prevents the regulator from operating at source \nvoltages where the problems might occur . This threshold \ncan be adjusted by setting the values R5 and R6 such that \nthey satisfy the following equation:\n VIN EN( )=R5\nR6+1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟• 0.8V\nwhere the corresponding channel will remain off until \nVIN is above V IN(EN) . Due to the comparator’s hysteresis, \nswitching will not stop until the input falls slightly below \nVIN(EN) .\nWhen operating in Burst Mode operation for light load \ncurrents, the current through the V IN(EN)  resistor network \ncan easily be greater than the supply current consumed by the LT8652S. Therefore, the V\nIN(EN)  resistors should \nbe large to minimize their effect on efficiency at low loads.\nLT8652S\n24\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comVCC Regulator\nAn internal low dropout (LDO) regulator produces the 3.4V  \nsupply from V IN1 that powers the drivers and the internal \nbias circuitry. For this reason, V IN1 must be present and \nvalid to use either channel. The V CC can supply enough \ncurrent for the LT8652S’ s circuitry and must be bypassed \nto ground with a 1μF ceramic capacitor . Good bypassing is \nnecessary to supply the high transient currents required \nby the power MOSFET gate drivers. To improve efficiency the internal LDO can also draw current from the BIAS pin when the BIAS pin is at 3.1V or higher . Typically the BIAS \npin can be tied to the lowest output or external supply \nabove 3.1V. If BIAS is connected to a supply other than V\nOUT, be sure to bypass with a local ceramic capacitor . If \nthe BIAS pin is below 3.0V, the internal LDO will consume \ncurrent from V IN1. \nApplications with high input voltage and high switching frequency where the internal LDO pulls current from V\nIN1 \nwill increase die temperature because of the higher power \ndissipation across the LDO. Do not connect an external load to the V\nCC pin. \nFrequency Compensation\nThe LT8652S has VC pins which can be used to optimize \nthe loop compensation of each channel. If the VC pins are \nshorted to V CC, then internal compensation is used. This \nsimplifies the circuit design and minimizes the quiescent \ncurrent, but since the internal compensation has to be \nstable across the 300kHz to 3MHz range of switching \nfrequencies, the internal compensation will not be opti -\nmal, especially at high switching frequencies. If the best \ntransient response is desired, an external compensation network can be connected to the VC pin, which usually consists of a series resistor and capacitor (see R\nC and C C \nin the Block Diagram). \nDesigning the compensation network is a bit complicated \nand the best values depend on the application and in par -\nticular the type of output capacitor . A practical approach is to start with one of the cir cuits in the data sheet that is \nsimilar to your application and tune the compensation net -\nwork to optimize the performance. L Tspice® simulations APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\ncan help in this process. Stability should then be checked \nacross all operating conditions, including load current, \ninput voltage and temperature. \nThe LT1375  data sheet contains a more thorough discus -\nsion of loop compensation and describes how to test the stability using a transient load. \nFigure\xa04 shows an equivalent circuit for the LT8652S \ncontrol loop. The error amplifier is a transconductance \namplifier with finite output impedance. The power section, \nconsisting of the modulator , power switches, and inductor , \nis modeled as a transconductance amplifier generating an \noutput current proportional to the voltage at the VC pin. Note that the output capacitor integrates this current and that the capacitor on the VC pin (C\nC) integrates the error \namplifier output current, resulting in two poles in the loop. \nA zero is required and comes from a resistor R C in series \nwith C C. This simple model works well as long as the value \nof the inductor is not too high and the loop crossover \nfrequency is much lower than the switching frequency. A \nphase lead capacitor (C PL) across the feedback divider can \nbe used to improve the transient response and is required \nto cancel the parasitic pole caused by the feedback node to ground capacitance. \nFigure\xa04.

T ransient ResponseOutput Voltage T racking and Soft-Start\nThe LT8652S allows the user to program its output volt -\nage ramp rate with the SS pin. An internal 2μA current \npulls up the SS pin to V CC. Putting an external capacitor \non SS, enables soft-starting the output to prevent current \nsurge on the input supply. During the soft-start ramp, the output voltage will proportionally track the SS pin volt -\nage. For output tracking applications, SS can be externally \ndriven by another voltage source. From 0V to 0.04V, the SS pin will stop the corresponding channel from switch -\ning, thus allowing the SS pin to be used as a shutdown pin. From 0.04V to 0.6V, the SS voltage will override the \ninternal \n0.6V reference input to the error amplifier , thus \nregulating the FB pin voltage to that of SS pin (Figure\xa06). When SS is sufficiently above 0.6V, tracking is disabled \nand the feedback voltage will regulate to the internal refer -\nence voltage. The SS pin may be left floating if the func-\ntion is not needed. Note that in both Burst Mode operation \nand forced continuous mode (FCM), the LT8652S will not \ndischarge the output to regulate to a lower SS voltage.\nAn active pull-down circuit is connected to the SS pin \nwhich will discharge the external soft-start capacitor in \nthe case of fault conditions and restart the ramp when the \nfaults are cleared. Fault conditions that clear the soft-start \ncapacitor are the EN/UV pin below 0.8V, V IN1 voltage fall-\ning too low, or thermal shutdown.\nSS VOL TAGE (V)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nFB VOL TAGE (V)\n8652S F06\nEXTERNAL COMPENSATION\nINTERNAL COMPENSATION\nFigure\xa06.

B For more information www.analog.comOutput Power Good\nWhen the LT8652S’ s output voltage is within the ±7% \nwindow of the regulation point, which is a FB voltage in \nthe range of 0.56V to 0.64V (typical), the output voltage is considered good and the open-drain PG pin goes high \nimpedance and is typically pulled high with an external \nresistor . Otherwise, the internal pull-down device will pull \nthe PG pin low. To prevent glitching both the upper and lower thresholds, include 0.25% of hysteresis. \nThe PG pin is also actively pulled low during several fault \nconditions:  corresponding EN/UV pin below 0.8V , VCC \nvoltage falling too low, V IN1 under voltage or thermal \nshutdown.\nSequencing\nStart-up sequencing and tracking can be configured in \nseveral ways with the LT8652S. One channel can be \nrequired to be valid before enabling the other channel to \nsequence their start-up order . This can be done by con -\nnecting the PG pin of the first channel to the SS pin of the second channel. \nThe channels can also be started at the same time where \nthe output voltages can track in a ratiometric fashion (see \nFigure\xa07).APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nParallelingTo increase the possible output current, the two channels \ncan be connected in parallel to the same output. To do \nthis, the VC, SS, and FB pins of each channel are con -\nnected together , while each channel’ s SW node is con -\nnected to the common output through its own inductor . Figure\xa08 shows an application where the two channels of one LT8652S regulator are combined to get one output capable of 17A DC with 24A peak transients. \nSW1\nSW2\nFB1\nFB2\nSNSGND1SNSGND2\nVC1VC2\nPG1PG2V\nIN1\nVIN2\nEN\nRT VCC GND SYNC\n8652S F080.3µH0.3µH\n665k 10pF\n1000pF330µF\n(×2)\n1210X5R 1M 5.11k\n10k\n100k\nfSW = 1.5MHz27.4k 1µFVOUT\n1V17AV\nIN1\n3.6V\nTO 18V\nL T8652S5.11k\n22nF22µF\nL1, L2: XEL4030-301MEBIAS\nCLKOUTTEMPIMON1\nIMON2\nSS1\nSS2\nFigure\xa08.

B For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSynchronization\nTo select low ripple Burst Mode operation, tie the SYNC \npin below 0.4V (this can be ground or a logic low output). \nTo select forced continuous mode (FCM), float the SYNC \npin. To select FCM with Spread Spectrum Modulation \n(SSM), tie the SYNC pin above 2.8V (SYNC can be tied to \nVCC). To synchronize the LT8652S oscillator to an external \nfrequency connect a square wave (with 20% to 80% duty \ncycle) to the SYNC pin. The square wave amplitude should \nhave valleys that are below 0.4V and peaks above 1.5V \n(up to 6V). When synchronized to an external clock the LT8652S will use FCM.\nChannel 1 will synchronize its positive switch edge \ntransitions to the positive edge of the SYNC signal and \nChannel\xa02 will synchronize to the negative edge of the \nSYNC signal.\nThe LT8652 S may be synchronized over a 300kHz to \n3MHz range. The R T resistor should be chosen to set \nthe LT8652S switching frequency equal to or below the \nlowest synchronization input. For example, if the synchro -\nnization signal will be 500kHz and higher , the R T should \nbe selected for nominal 500kHz. \nThe slope compensation is set by the R T value, while the \nminimum slope compensation required to avoid subhar -\nmonic oscillations is established by the inductor size, \ninput voltage, and output voltage. Since the synchroniza -\ntion frequency will not change the slopes of the inductor \ncurrent waveform, if the inductor is large enough to avoid \nsubharmonic oscillations at the frequency set by R T, then \nthe slope compensation will be sufficient for all synchro -\nnization frequencies. \nA synchronizing signal that incorporates spread spectrum \nmay reduce EMI. The duty cycle of the SYNC signal can \nbe used to set the relative phasing of the two channels for minimizing input ripple.\nForced Continuous Mode\nForced continuous mode (FCM) is activated by either float -\ning the SYNC pin, applying a DC voltage above 2.8V to the \nSYNC pin, or applying an external clock to the SYNC\xa0pin. While in FCM, discontinuous mode operation is disabled \nand the inductor current is allowed to go negative so that \nthe regulator can switch at the programmed frequency all \nthe way down to zero output current. This has the advan -\ntage of maintaining the programmed switching frequency \nacross the entire load range so that the switch harmonics \nand EMI are consistent and predictable. The disadvantage \nof FCM is that the light load efficiency will be low com -\npared to Burst Mode operation. \nAt low input voltages when the part enters dropout, the \nprogrammed switching frequency will be maintained \nand off time skipping will not be allowed. This keeps the \nswitching frequency controlled, but the dropout voltage will be higher than in Burst Mode operation due to maxi -\nmum duty cycle constraints.\nThe negative inductor current is limited to a maximum of \nabout –4A\n, so the LT8652S can only sink a maximum of \nabout –2A. This prevents boosting an excessive amount of current back from the output to the input. Additional \nsafety features include disabling FCM when the SS pin \nvoltage is below 1.8V during start-up to prevent discharg -\ning the output when starting up into a pre-biased output, and a bottom FET current limit to prevent over charging the output if the minimum on time is violated.\nSpread Spectrum Modulation\nSpread spectrum modulation (SSM) is activated by apply -\ning a DC voltage above 2.8V to the SYNC pin. SSM reduces \nthe EMI/EMC emissions by modulating the switching fre -\nquency between the value programmed by R T to approxi-\nmately 20% higher than that value. The switching fre -\nquency is modulated linearly up and then linearly down at \na 7kHz rate. This is an analog function, so each switching \nperiod will be different than the previous one. For exam -\nple, when the LT8652S is programmed to 2MHz and the SSM feature is enabled, the switching frequency will var y \nfrom \n2MHz to 2.4MHz at a 7kHz rate. When in SSM, the \npart will also operate in forced continuous mode.\nLT8652S\n28\nRev. B For more information www.analog.comClock Output\nThe CLKOUT pin outputs a clock which can be used to \nsynchronous other regulators to the LT8652S. In Burst \nMode operation (SYNC pin low), the CLKOUT pin is \ngrounded. In forced continuous mode (SYNC pin float \nor DC high), the CLKOUT pin outputs a 50% duty cycle clock where the CLKOUT rising edge is 90 degrees phase shifted relative to Channel\xa01. If this CLKOUT waveform is \napplied to the SYNC pin of another LT8652S regulator , \nthen four-phase operation can be achieved. If an external \nclock is applied to the SYNC pin of the LT8652S, then \nthe CLKOUT pin will output a waveform with the same \nphasing and duty cycle as the SYNC pin clock. The low and high levels of the CLKOUT pin are ground and V\nCC, \nrespectively. The edge rates will be slower if the CLKOUT trace has extra capacitance. \nTemperature Monitor Function\nThe TEMP pin will output a voltage proportional to die \ntemperature. The TEMP pin typically outputs 250mV for \n25°C and has a slope of 11mV/°C. Without the aid of an \nexternal circuitry, the TEMP pin output is valid from 20°C \nto 150°C  (200mV to 1.6V). Do not load the TEMP pin with \nmore than 100µA. To extend the TEMP pin output below 20°C, connect a resistor from the TEMP pin to a negative voltage. The TEMP pin output is valid down to –35°C.\nAs a safeguard, the LT8652S has an additional thermal \nshutdown set at a typical value of 165°C. If the thermal \nshutdown is exceeded, both channels of the LT8652S will \nbe shutdown until the thermal overload event expires.\nIt should be noted that the TEMP pin voltage represents \nthe steady-state, average die temperature and should not \nbe used to guarantee that maximum junction tempera -\ntures are not exceeded. Instantaneous power along with \nthermal gradients and time constants may cause portions \nof the die to exceed maximum ratings. Be sure to calculate \ndie temperature rise for steady state (>1 Min) as well as impulse conditions.\nShorted and Reversed Input Protection\nThe LT8652S will tolerate a shorted output. The bottom \nswitch current is monitored such that if inductor current APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nis beyond safe levels, switching of the top switch will be \ndelayed until such time as the inductor current falls to \nsafe levels. Fault condition of one channel will not affect the operation of the other channel.\nThere is another situation to consider in systems where \nthe output will be held high when the input to the LT8652S \nis absent. This may occur in battery charging applica -\ntions or in battery-backup systems where a battery or \nsome other supply is ORed with Channel\xa01’s output. If \nthe V IN1 pin is allowed to float and the EN/UV pin is held \nhigh (either by a logic signal or because it is tied to V IN1), \nthen the LT8652S’s internal circuitry will pull its quies -\ncent current through its SW1 pin. This is acceptable if \nthe system can tolerate current draw in this state. If the \nEN/UV pin is grounded, the SW1 pin current will drop \nto near 6µA. However , if the V IN1 pin is grounded while \nChannel\xa01 output is held high, regardless of EN/UV1, para -\nsitic body diodes inside the LT8652S can pull current \nfrom the output through the SW1 pin and the V IN1 pin, \ndamaging the\xa0IC. V\nIN2 is not connected to the shared internal supply and \nwill not draw any current if left floating. If both V IN1 and \nVIN2 are floating, regardless of EN/UV pin states, no load \nwill be present at the output of Channel\xa02. However , if the \nVIN2 pin is grounded while Channel\xa02 output is held high, \nparasitic body diodes inside the LT8652 S can pull current \nfrom the output through the SW2 pin and the V IN2 pin, \ndamaging the IC. \nFigure\xa09 shows a connection of the V IN pins and EN/UV \npin that will allow the LT8652S to run only when the input \nvoltage is present and that protects against a shorted or \nreversed input.\nFigure\xa09. 8652S F09L T8652SVIN2 VIN1 VIN1\nEN/UV\nReverse V IN Protection\nLT8652S\n29\nRev.

Figure\xa010 shows \nthe recommended component placement with trace, \nground plane and via locations. Note that large, switched \ncurrents flow in the LT8652S’s V IN pins, GND pins, and \nthe input capacitors. The loop formed by the input capaci -\ntor should be as small as possible by placing the capacitor \nadjacent to the V IN and GND pins. When using a physically \nlarge input capacitor , the resulting loop may become too \nlarge in which case using a small case/value capacitor \nplaced close to the V IN and GND pins plus a larger capaci -\ntor further away is preferred. These components, along with the inductor and output capacitor , should be placed on the same side of the circuit board and their connec -\ntions should be made on that layer . Place a local, unbroken \nground plane under the application circuit on the layer \nclosest to the surface layer . The SW and BOOST nodes should be as small as possible. Finally, keep the FB and \nRT nodes small so that the ground traces will shield them \nfrom the SW and BOOST nodes. The exposed pad acts as a heat sink and is connected electrically to ground. To keep thermal resistance low, extend the ground plane as much as possible and add thermal vias under and near \nthe LT8652S to additional ground planes within the circuit \nboard and on the bottom side. See Figure\xa010 for example \nPCB layout.\nFigure\xa010. Recommended Layout8652S F10L1\nL2COUT1\nCOUT2CIN1CPL2 CPL1CC2\nCC1\nRTR3 R1R4 R2RC2 RC1\nCIN2\nLT8652S\n30\nRev.

The exposed pad on the bottom of the package must be soldered to a ground plane. This ground should be tied to large copper layers \nbelow with thermal vias;  these layers will spread heat \ndissipated by the LT8652 S. Placing additional vias can \nreduce thermal resistance further . The maximum load \ncurrent should be derated as the ambient temperature \napproaches the maximum junction rating. Power dissipa -\ntion within the LT8652S can be estimated by calculating the total power loss from an efficiency measurement and subtracting the inductor loss. The die temperature is cal -\nculated by multiplying the LT8652S power dissipation by the thermal resistance from junction to ambient. \nThe internal thermal shutdown protection of LT8652S will \nstop switching and indicate a fault condition if junction APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\ntemperature exceeds 165°C. The fault condition will clear and switching resume when the temperature drops back below 160°C. \nTemperature rise of the LT8652S is worst when operating \nat high load, high V IN and high switching frequency. If \nthe case temperature is too high for a given application, then either V\nIN, switching frequency or load current can \nbe decreased to reduce the temperature to an acceptable \nlevel. Figure\xa011 shows examples case temperature vs V IN, \nswitching frequency and load. \nThe LT8652S’ s internal power switches are capable of \nsafely delivering up to 12A of maximum output current. \nHowever , due to thermal limits, the package can only han-\ndle 12A loads for short periods of time. Figure\xa012 shows an example of how case temperature rise changes with the duty cycle of a 1kHz pulsed 12A load. \nFigure\xa011. Case Temperature Rise Figure\xa012.
