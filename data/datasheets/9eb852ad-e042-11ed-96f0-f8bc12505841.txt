ADM707 /ADM708 \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADM705 /ADM706 /ADM707 /ADM708  microprocessor \nsupervisory circuits are suitable for monitoring 5 V power \nsupplies/batteries and microprocessor activity. \nThe ADM705 /ADM706  provide power-supply monitoring \ncircuitry that generate a reset output during power-up, power-\ndown, and brownout conditions. The reset output remains \noperational with V CC as low as 1 V . Independent watchdog \nmonitoring circuitry is also provided. This is activated if the \nwatchdog input has not been toggled within 1.60 sec. \nIn addition, there is a 1.25 V threshold detector to warn of \npower failures, to detect low battery conditions, or to monitor an additional power supply. An active low, debounced manual reset \ninput ( MR\n) is also included. The ADM705  and ADM706  are identical except for the reset \nthreshold monitor levels, which are 4.65 V and 4.40 V , respectively.  \nThe ADM707  and ADM708  provide a similar functionality to \nthe ADM705  and ADM706  and only differ in that a watchdog \ntimer function is not available. Instead, an active high reset \noutput (RESET) is available as well as the active low reset output \n(RESET ). The ADM707  and ADM708  are identical except for \nthe reset threshold monitor levels, which are 4.65 V and 4.40 V , \nrespectively. \nAll devices are available in narrow 8-lead PDIP and 8-lead SOIC \npackages. \nADM705/ADM706/ADM707/ADM708  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

H | Page 8  of 12 CIRCUIT INFORMATION \nPOWER FAIL  RESET  OUTPUT  \nRESET  is an active low output that provides a reset signal to  \nthe microprocessor whenever the V CC input is below the reset \nthreshold. An internal timer holds RESET  low for 200 ms after \nthe voltage on V CC rises above the threshold. This functions as a \npower -on reset signal for the microprocessor. It allows time for \nboth the power supply and the microprocessor to stabilize after \npower -up. The RESET  output is guaranteed to remain valid  (low) \nwith V CC as low as 1 V . This ensures that the microprocessor is \nheld in a stable shutdown condition as the power supply voltage \nramps up.  \nIn addition to RESET , an active high RESET output is also available \non the ADM707/ ADM708. This is the complement of RESET  \nand is useful for processors requiring an active high r eset signal.  \nMANUAL RESET  \nThe manual reset input ( MR) allows other reset sources, such as \na manual reset switch, to generate a processor reset. The input is \neffectively debounced by the timeout period (200 ms typical ly). \nThe MR input is TTL -/CMOS -compatible, so it can also be driven  \nby any logic reset output.  \nVCC\nRESET\nMR\nWDOVRT\nMR EXTERNAL LY\nDRIVEN LOW\n00088-007VRT\ntRS tRS\n \nFigure 13. RESET , MR, and WDO  Timing  \nWATCHDOG TIMER ( ADM705/ ADM706 ) \nThe watchdog timer circuit can monitor the activity of the micro -\nprocessor to check that it is not stalled in an indefinite loop. An \noutput line on the processor toggle s the watchdog input (WDI) \nline.  If this line is not toggled withi n the timeout  period (1.6 0 sec), \nthen the watchdog output ( WDO ) goes low. The WDO  can be \nconnected to a nonmaskable interrupt (NMI) on the processor; therefore, if the watchdog timer times out, an interrupt is gen -\nerated. The interrupt service routine then rectif ies the problem.  \nIf a RESET  signal is required when a timeout occurs, the WDO  \nmust  connect to the manual reset input ( MR). The watchdog timer is cleared by either a high to low or a low  to \nhigh transition on WDI. It is a lso cleared by RESET  going low; \ntherefore, the watchdog timeout period begins after RESET  \ngoes high.  \nWhen V CC falls below the reset threshold, WDO  is forced low , \nwhether or not the watchdog timer has timed out. Normally , this \ngenerates an interrupt, but it is overridden by RESET  going low.  \nThe watchdog monitor can be deactivated by floating the WDI. \nThe WDO  can then be used as a low line output because it goes \nlow only when V CC falls below the reset threshold.  \ntWP\nWDI\nWDO\nRESET\ntRSRESET EXTERNAL LY\nTRIGGERED B Y MRtWDtWD tWD\n00088-008 \nFigure 14. Watchdog Timing  \nPOWER FAIL  COMPARATOR  \nThe power fail  comparator is an independent comparator that \ncan monitor the input power  supply. The comparator inverting \ninput is internally connected to a 1.25 V reference voltage. The \nnoninverting input is available at the PFI input. This input can monitor the input power supply via  a resistive divider network. \nWhen the voltage on the PFI input drops below 1.25  V,  t h e  \ncomparator output (\nPFO ) goes low, indicating a power failure . For \nearly warning of power failure, the comparator monitors the \npreregulator input by choosing an appropriate resistive divider \nnetwork. The PFO  output can interrupt the processor so a \nshutdown procedure is implemented before power is lost.  \nAs the voltage on the PFI pin is limited to V CC + 0.3 V,  i t  i s  \nrecommended to connect the PFI pin with a S chottky diode  to \nthe RESET  pin as shown in Figure 15. This help s clamping the \nPFI pin voltage during device power up and operation.   \nINPUT\nPOWER\nR1\nR2POWER- FAIL\nINPUT1.25V\nPFIPFOPOWER- FAIL\nOUTPUT\nADM705/ADM706/\nADM707/ADM708\n00088-009RESET\nOUTPUTRESET\n \nFigure 15.

H | Page 9 of 12 Adding Hysteresis to the Power Fail Comparator \nFor increased noise immunity, hysteresis can be added to the \npower fail comparator. Because the comparator circuit is \nnoninverting, hysteresis can be added by connecting a resistor \nbetween the PFO  output and the PFI input as shown in Figure 16.  \n7VTO 15V\nINPUT\nPOWER\nTO\nMICROPROCESSOR\nNMI\nR35V\nVCC R1\nR21.25V\nPFIPFOADP3367\n5V\n0V\n0VVL\nVINVH–\n+\n00088-010PFOADM705/ADM706/\nADM707/ADM708RESET\nTO\nMICROPROCESSOR\nRESET\n \nFigure 16. Adding Hysteresis to the Power Fail Comparator When PFO  is low, Resistor R3 sinks current from the summing \njunction at the PFI pin. When PFO  is high, Resistor R3 sources \ncurrent into the PFI summing junction. This results in differing \ntrip levels for the comparator. Further noise immunity can be achieved by connecting a capacitor between PFI and GND.

As V CC drops below 1 V , \nthe internal transistor does not have sufficient drive to hold the \nvoltage RESET  at 0 V . A pull-down resistor can connect externally, \nas shown in Figure 17, to hold the line low if required. \nADM705/ADM706/\nADM707/ADM708\nGNDRESET\nR1\n00088-011 \nFigure 17.

The un-\nregulated dc input supply is monitored using PFI via the resistive divider network. Resistor R1 and Resistor R2 must be selected so when the supply voltage drops below the desired level (such \nas 8 V), the voltage on PFI drops below the 1.25 V threshold, \nthereby generating an interrupt to the microprocessor.

#### Description:
The ADM707 is a microprocessor supervisory circuit designed to monitor power supplies and microprocessor activity. It provides essential functions such as generating a reset signal during power-up, power-down, and brownout conditions. The device ensures that the microprocessor operates reliably by holding it in a reset state until the power supply stabilizes.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Microprocessor Systems:** Ensures stable operation by monitoring supply voltage and generating reset signals.
- **Computers and Controllers:** Provides power management and reset functionality to maintain system integrity.
- **Intelligent Instruments:** Monitors critical supply voltages to prevent malfunction during power fluctuations.
- **Critical Microprocessor Supply Monitoring:** Alerts the system of low voltage conditions to prevent data corruption or system failure.

The ADM707 is particularly useful in applications where a reliable reset signal is crucial for system stability, making it an ideal choice for embedded systems and other electronic devices requiring robust power management.
