The default mode output isa full−resolution image at 60 frames per second (fps). It\noutputs 12 −bit raw data, using either the parallel or serial\n(MIPI) output ports. The device may be operated in video\n(master) mode or in frame trigger mode.\nFRAME_V ALID and LINE_V ALID signals are output on\ndedicated pins, along with a synchronized pixel clock.A dedicated FLASH pin can be programmed to controlexternal LED or flash exposure illumination.The AR0144AT includes additional features to allow\napplication −specific tuning: windowing, adjustable\nauto−exposure control, auto black level correction,\non−board temperature sensor, row −skip and column −skip\nmodes and binning modes.\nThe sensor is designed to operate in a wide temperature\nrange (–40 °C to +105 °C).\nFUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW\nThe AR0144AT is a progressive −scan sensor that\ngenerates a stream of pixel data at a constant frame rate. Ituses an on −chip, phase −locked loop (PLL) that can be\noptionally enabled to generate all internal clocks from\na single master input clock running between 6 and 48 MHz.\nThe maximum output pixel rate is 74.25 Mp/s,corresponding to a clock rate of 74.25 MHz.

The core of\nthe sensor is a 1.0 Mp Active −Pixel Sensor array. The\nAR0144AT\nwww. onsemi.com\n3AR0144A T features global shutter technology for accurate\ncapture of moving images. The exposure of the entire array\nis controlled by programming the integration time by\nregister setting. All rows simultaneously integrate light prior\nto readout. Once a row has been read, the data from thecolumns is sequenced through an analog signal chain(providing offset correction and gain), and then through ananalog−to−digital converter (ADC). The output from the\nADC is a 12 −bit value for each pixel in the array. The ADC\noutput passes through a digital processing signal chain(which provides further data path corrections and applies\ndigital gain). The pixel data are output at a rate of up to\n74.25 Mp/s, in parallel to frame and line synchronizationsignals.\nFEATURES OVERVIEW\nThe AR0144AT Global Shutter sensor has a wide array of\nfeatures to enhance functionality and to increase versatility.\nA summary of features follows. Please refer to the AR0144\nDeveloper Guide for detailed feature descriptions, registersettings, and tuning guidelines and recommendations.\n•3.0/C0109m Global Shutter Pixel\nTo improve the low light performance and to capture\nthe moving images accurately a large (3.0 /C0109m) global\nshutter pixel is implemented for better image\noptimization.\n•Operating Modes\nThe AR0144AT works in master (video), trigger (single\nframe), or Auto Trigger modes. In master mode, \nthe sensor generates the integration and readout timing. \nIn trigger mode, it accepts an external trigger to startexposure, then generates the exposure and readout\ntiming. The exposure time is programmed through the\ntwo−wire serial interface for both modes.\n•Window Control\nConfigurable window size and blanking times allow\na wide range of resolutions and frame rates. Digital\nbinning and skipping modes are supported, as are\nvertical and horizontal mirror operations.\n•Frame Rate\nAR0144A T is capable of running up to 60 fps at full\n(1280 ×800) resolution and 66 fps at 720p resolution.\n•Embedded Data and Statistics\nThe AR0144AT has the capability to output image data\nand statistics embedded within the frame timing.\n•Multi−Camera Synchronization\nThe AR0144AT supports advanced line synchronization\ncontrols for multi −camera (stereo) support.\n•Context Switching and Register Updates\nContext switching may be used to rapidly switchbetween two sets of register values.\nRefer to the AR0144 Developer Guide for a complete\ndescription of context switchable registers.\n•Gain\nA programmable analog gain of 1x to 16x applied\nglobally to all color channels is available along with\na digital gain of 1x to 16x that may be configured ona per color channel basis.\n•Automatic Exposure Control\nThe integrated automatic exposure control may be used\nto ensure optimal settings of exposure and gain are\ncomputed and updated every other frame. Refer to theAR0144 Developer Guide for more details.\n•MIPI\nThe AR0144AT Global Shutter image sensor supports\ntwo lanes of MIPI data. Compliant to MIPI standards:\n♦MIPI Alliance Standard for CSI −2 version 1.2\n♦MIPI Alliance Standard for D −PHY version 1.0\n•PLL\nAn on chip PLL provides reference clock flexibility and\nsupports spread spectrum sources for improved EMI\nperformance.\n•Reset\nThe AR0144AT may be reset by a register write, or by\na dedicated input pin.\n•Output Enable\nThe AR0144AT output pins may be tri −stated using\na dedicated output enable pin.\n•Temperature Sensor\n•Black Level Correction\n•Row Noise Correction\n•Test Patterns\nSeveral test patterns may be enabled for debug\npurposes. These include a solid color, color bar, fade togray, and a walking 1s test pattern.\n•Silicon/OTPM Revision Information\nA revision register is provided to read out (via I2C)\nsilicon and OTPM revision information. This will be\nhelpful to distinguish material if there are future OTPM\nor silicon revisions.\n•Lens Shading Correction\nA lens shading correction algorithm is included for\npotential low Z height applications.\n•Compression\nAR0144AT can optionally compress 12 −bit data to\n10−bit using A −law compression.\nAR0144AT\nwww. onsemi.com\n4PIXEL DATA FORMAT\nPixel Array Structure\nThe AR0144AT pixel array is configured as 1484 columns\nby 856 rows, (see Figure 2). The dark pixels are opticallyblack and are used internally to monitor black level. Of theleft 180 columns, 168 are dark pixels used for row noisecorrection. Of the bottom 32 rows of pixels, 8 of the darkrows are used for black level correction. There are 1300\ncolumns by 820 rows of optically active pixels. While the\nsensor’s format is 1280 × 800, the additional active columnsand active rows are included for use when horizontal or\nvertical mirrored readout is enabled, to allow readout to start\non the same pixel. The pixel adjustment is always performed\nfor monochrome or color versions. The central 1288 × 808\npixel active area is surrounded with optically transparentdummy pixels and non −optically transparent barrier pixels\nto improve image uniformity within the active area. Not allbarrier pixels can be read out. The optical center of thereadable active pixels can be found between X_ADDR 649\nand 650, and between Y_ADDR 409 and 410.\nFigure 2.

The sensor actsas a slave device. The master generates a clock (S\nCLK) that\nis an input to the sensor and is used to synchronize transfers.Data is transferred between the master and the slave ona bidirectional signal (S\nDATA ). S DATA  is pulled up to\nVDD_IO off−chip by a 1.5 k /C0087 resistor. Either the slave or\nmaster device can drive S DATA  LOW − the interface protocol\ndetermines which device is allowed to drive S DATA  at any\ngiven time.\nThe protocols described in the two −wire serial interface\nspecification allow the slave device to drive S CLK LOW;\nthe AR0144A T uses S CLK as an input only and therefore\nnever drives it LOW.\nProtocol\nData transfers on the two −wire serial interface bus are\nperformed by a sequence of low −level protocol elements:\n•a (repeated) start condition\n•a slave address/data direction byte\n•an (a no) acknowledge bit\n•a message byte\n•a stop condition\nThe bus is idle when both S CLK and S DATA  are HIGH.\nControl of the bus is initiated with a start condition, and the\nbus is released with a stop condition. Only the master cangenerate the start and stop conditions.\nStart Condition\nA start condition is defined as a HIGH −to−LOW\ntransition on S\nDATA  while S CLK is HIGH. At the end of a\ntransfer, the master can generate a start condition without\npreviously generating a stop condition; this is known as a\n“repeated start” or “restart” condition.\nStop Condition\nA stop condition is defined as a LOW −to−HIGH transition\non S DATA  while S CLK is HIGH.\nData Transfer\nData is transferred serially, 8 bits at a time, with the MSB\ntransmitted first. Each byte of data is followed by an\nacknowledge bit or a no −acknowledge bit. This data transfer\nmechanism is used for the slave address/data direction byte\nand for message bytes.\nOne data bit is transferred during each S CLK clock period.\nSDATA  can change when S CLK is LOW and must be stable\nwhile S CLK is HIGH.\nSlave Address/Data Direction Byte\nBits [7:1] of this byte represent the device slave address\nand bit [0] indicates the data transfer direction. A “0” inbit [0] indicates a WRITE, and a “1” indicates a READ.\nThe default slave addresses used by the AR0144AT are 0x20\n(write address) and 0x21 (read address) in accordance with\nthe specification. Alternate slave addresses of 0x30 (write\naddress) and 0x31 (read address) can be selected by enabling\nand asserting the S ADDR  input.\nAn alternate slave address can also be programmed\nthrough R0x31FC.\nMessage Byte\nMessage bytes are used for sending register addresses and\nregister write data to the slave device and for retrievingregister read data.\nAcknowledge Bit\nEach 8−bit data transfer is followed by an acknowledge bit\nor a no−acknowledge bit in the S\nCLK clock period following\nthe data transfer. The transmitter (which is the master whenwriting, or the slave when reading) releases S\nDATA .\nThe receiver indicates an acknowledge bit by driving S DATA\nLOW. As for data transfers, S DATA  can change when S CLK\nis LOW and must be stable while S CLK is HIGH.\nNo−Acknowledge Bit\nThe no−acknowledge bit is generated when the receiver\ndoes not drive S DATA  LOW during the S CLK clock period\nfollowing a data transfer. A no −acknowledge bit is used to\nterminate a read sequence.\nTypical Sequence\nA typical READ or WRITE sequence begins by the\nmaster generating a start condition on the bus. After the start\ncondition, the master sends the 8 −bit slave address/data\ndirection byte. The last bit indicates whether the request isfor a read or a write, where a “0” indicates a write and a “1”indicates a read. If the address matches the address of theslave device, the slave device acknowledges receipt of theaddress by generating an acknowledge bit on the bus.\nIf the request was a WRITE, the master then transfers the\n16−bit register address to which the WRITE should take\nplace. This transfer takes place as two 8 −bit sequences and\nthe slave sends an acknowledge bit after each sequence toindicate that the byte has been received. The master thentransfers the data as an 8 −bit sequence; the slave sends an\nacknowledge bit at the end of the sequence. The master stops\nwriting by generating a (re)start or stop condition.\nIf the request was a READ, the master sends the 8 −bit\nwrite slave address/data direction byte and 16 −bit register\naddress, the same way as with a WRITE request. The master\nthen generates a (re)start condition and the 8 −bit read slave\naddress/data direction byte, and clocks out the register data,\neight bits at a time. The master generates an acknowledge bit\nafter each 8−bit transfer. The slave’ s internal register address\nis automatically incremented after every 8 bits are\ntransferred. The data transfer is stopped when the master\nsends a no −acknowledge bit.\nAR0144AT\nwww. onsemi.com\n10Single READ from Random Location\nThis sequence (Figure 7) starts with a dummy WRITE to\nthe 16−bit address that is to be used for the READ. The\nmaster terminates the WRITE by generating a restartcondition. The master then sends the 8 −bit read slave\naddress/data direction byte and clocks out one byte ofregister data. The master terminates the READ by\ngenerating a no −acknowledge bit followed by a stop\ncondition. Figure 7 shows how the internal register address\nmaintained by the AR0144AT is loaded and incremented as\nthe sequence proceeds.\nFigure 7.

This table is based on I2C standard (v2.1 January 2000). Philips Semiconductor.\n2. Two−wire control is I2C−compatible.\n3. All values referred to V IHmin  = 0.9 V DD_IO and V ILmax  = 0.1 V DD_IO levels. Sensor EXCLK = 27 MHz.\n4. A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the S DATA signal to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of S CLK.\nThe two−wire standard specifies a minimum rise and fall time for Fast −Mode mode of operation. This specification\nis not a timing requirement that is enforced on ON Semiconductor sensor’s as a receiver, because these receivers are designed t o work in\nmixed systems with std −mode where no such minimum rise and fall times are required/specified. However, it’s the host’s responsibility when\nusing fast edge rates, especially when two −wire slew −rate driver control isn’t available, to manage the generated EMI, and the potential\nvoltage undershoot on the sensor receiver circuitry, to avoid activating sensor ESD diodes and current −clamping circuits. This is typically\nnot an issue in most applications, but should be checked if below minimum fall times and rise times are required.\n5. The maximum t HD;DAT  has only to be met if the device does not stretch the LOW period (t LOW) of the S CLK signal.\n6. A Fast −mode I2C−bus device can be used in a Standard −mode I2C−bus system, but the requirement t SU;DAT  250 ns must then be met. This\nwill automatically be the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the S CLK signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period\nof the S CLK signal, it must output the next data bit to the S DATA line t r max + t SU;DAT  = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the Standard −mode\nI2C−bus specification) before the S CLK line is released.\n7.
