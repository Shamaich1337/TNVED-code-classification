This general purpose switch maintains excellent linearity, high RF performance and \nfast settling time making this device ideal for test and measurement (T&M), automated test equipment (ATE) and other high performance wireless applications.\nThe PE42553 is a pin-compatible version of the PE42552 with improved power handling capability of 36 dBm \ncontinuous wave (CW) and 38 dBm pulsed power in 50 Ω at 8 GHz. No blocking capacitors are required if DC \nvoltage is not present on the RF ports. The PE42553 is manufactured on pSemi’s UltraCMOS\n® process, a \npatented variation of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology on a sapphire substrate.Figure 1 \x81 PE42553 Functional Diagram\nRFC\n50Ω 50Ω\nCMOS Control Driver and ESDRF2 RF1\nLS CTRL VSS_EXT\nPE42553\nSPDT RF Switch\nPage 2 of 20 DOC-76991-2 – (11/2018)\nwww.psemi.compSemi’s HaRP technology enhancements deliver high linearity and excellent harmonics performance. It is an \ninnovative feature of the UltraCMOS process, offering the performance of GaAs with the economy and integration of conventional CMOS.   \nOptional External VSS \nFor proper operation, the VSS_EXT  pin must be grounded or tied to the VSS voltage specified in Table 2. When the \nVSS_EXT  pin is grounded, FETs in the switch are biased with an internal negative voltage generator. For applica-\ntions that require the lowest possible spur performance, VSS_EXT  can be applied externally to bypass the internal \nnegative voltage generator.\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings\nExceeding absolute maximum ratings listed in Table 1  may cause permanent damage. Operation should be \nrestricted to the limits in Table 2 . Operation between operating range maximum and absolute maximum for \nextended periods may reduce reliability.\nESD Precautions\nWhen handling this UltraCMOS device, observe the same precautions as with any other ESD-sensitive devices. Although this device contains circuitry to protect it from damage due to ESD, precautions should be taken to avoid exceeding the rating specified in Table 1.\nLatch-up Immunity\nUnlike conventional CMOS devices, UltraCMOS devices are immune to latch-up.\nTable 1 \x81 Absolute Maximum Ratings for PE42553\nParameter/Condition Min Max Unit\nSupply voltage, VDD –0.3 5.5 V\nDigital input voltage, CTRL –0.3 3.6 V\nLS input voltage –0.3 3.6 V\nRF input power, CW (RFC–RFX)(1)\n9 kHz–10 MHz\n>10 MHz–8 GHzFig. 2 , Fig. 3\n37dBm\ndBm\nRF input power, pulsed (RFC–RFX)(2)\n9 kHz–10 MHz\n>10 MHz–8 GHzFig. 2 , Fig. 3\nFig. 4 , Fig. 5dBm\ndBm\nRF input power into terminated ports, CW (RFX)(1)\n9–800 kHz\n>800 kHz–8 GHzFig. 2 , Fig. 3\n28dBm\ndBm\nMaximum junction temperature +150 °C\nStorage temperature range –65 +150 °C\nDOC-76991-2 – (11/2018) Page 3 of 20\nwww.psemi.comPE42553\nSPDT RF Switch\nESD voltage HBM(3)\nRF pins to GND\nAll pins4000\n2500VV\nESD voltage MM, all pins\n(4) 200 V\nESD voltage CDM, all pins(5) 1000 V\nNotes: \n1) 100% duty cycle, all bands, 50 Ω.\n2) Pulsed, 5% duty cycle of 4620 μs period, 50 Ω.\n3) Human body model (MIL-STD 883 Method 3015).\n4) Machine model (JEDEC JESD22-A115).5) Charged device model (JEDEC JESD22-C101).Table 1 \x81 Absolute Maximum Ratings for PE42553\nParameter/Condition Min Max Unit\nPE42553\nSPDT RF Switch\nPage 4 of 20 DOC-76991-2 – (11/2018)\nwww.psemi.comRecommended Operating Conditions\nTable 2 list the recommending operating condition for PE42553.

A faster switching rate is available in bypass mode (pin 13 tied to V\nSS_EXT ). The rate at which the PE42553 can be \nswitched is then limited to the switching time as specified in Table 3. \nSwitching frequency describes the time duration \nbetween switching events. Switching time is the time duration between the point the control signal reached 50% of the final value and the point the output signal reaches within 10% or 90% of its target value.\nSpur-Free Performance \nThe typical spurious performance of the PE42553 in normal mode is –152 dBm (pin 13 tied to ground). If spur-free performance is desired, the internal negative voltage generator can be disabled by applying a negative voltage to V\nSS_EXT  (pin 13).\nThermal Data\nPsi-JT (\uf059JT), junction top-of-package, is a thermal \nmetric to estimate junction temperature of a device on the customer application PCB (JEDEC JESD51-2).\n\uf059JT = (TJ – TT)/P \nwhere\n\uf059JT = junction-to-top of package characterization \nparameter, °C/W\nTJ = die junction temperature, °C\nTT = package temperature (top surface, in the \ncenter), °CP = power dissipated by device, WattsControl Logic\nTable 5 provides the control logic truth table for the \nPE42553.\nLogic Select\nThe Logic Select feature is used to determine the definition for the CTRL pin.\nTable 4 \x81 Thermal Data for PE42553\nParameter Typ Unit\n\uf059JT 41 °C/W\n\uf051JA, junction-to-ambient thermal resistance 93 °C/WTable 5 \x81 Truth Table for PE42553\nLS CTRL RFC–RF1 RFC–RF2\n0 0 OFF ON\n0 1 ON OFF\n1 0 ON OFF\n1 1 OFF ON\nDOC-76991-2 – (11/2018) Page 7 of 20\nwww.psemi.comPE42553\nSPDT RF Switch\nFigure 2 \x81 Power De-rating Curve for 9 kHz–10 MHz @ 25 °C Ambient (50Ω)(*)\nNote: * VSS_EXT  = –VDD.\nFigure 3 \x81 Power De-rating Curve for 9 kHz–10 MHz @ 85 °C Ambient (50Ω)(*)\nNote: * VSS_EXT  = –VDD.0510152025303540\n1 10 100 1000 10000Input Power (dBm)\nFrequency (kHz)2.6 Vdd 2.8 Vdd 3.0 Vdd 3.2 Vdd 3.4 Vdd\n0510152025303540\n1 10 100 1000 10000Input Power (dBm)\nFrequency (kHz)2.6 VDD 2.8 VDD 3.0 VDD 3.2 VDD 3.4 VDD\nPE42553\nSPDT RF Switch\nPage 8 of 20 DOC-76991-2 – (11/2018)\nwww.psemi.com          \nFigure 4 \x81 Power De-rating Curve for 10 MHz–8 GHz @ 25 °C Ambient (50Ω)(*)\nNote: * Normal mode at 2.3V ≥ VDD ≥ 5.5V and VSS_EXT  = 0V, Bypass mode at VDD = 3.4V and VSS_EXT  = –3.4V.\nFigure 5 \x81 Power De-rating Curve for 10 MHz–8 GHz @ 85 °C Ambient (50Ω)(*)\nNote: * Normal mode at 2.3V ≥ VDD ≥ 5.5V and VSS_EXT  = 0V, Bypass mode at VDD = 3.4V and VSS_EXT  = –3.4V.34.53535.53636.53737.53838.53939.54040.54141.5\n012345678Input Power (dBm)\nFrequency (GHz)  P0.1dB Compression / Abs.

### Component Summary: PE42553A-Z

**Description:**
The PE42553 is an UltraCMOS® SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) RF switch designed for high-performance applications. It operates over a broad frequency range from 9 kHz to 8 GHz and is particularly suited for test and measurement, automated test equipment, and general-purpose TX/RX switching applications. The device utilizes pSemi's HaRP™ technology, which enhances linearity and reduces distortion, making it ideal for high-performance wireless applications.
