The AD8400 contains a single variable resistor in the compact SOIC-8 package. The AD8402 contains two independent \nvariable resistors in space-saving SOIC-14 surface-mount \npackages. The AD8403 contains four independent variable resistors in 24-lead PDIP , SOIC, and TSSOP packages. Each part contains a fixed resistor with a wiper contact that taps the fixed resistor value at a point determined by the digital code \nloaded into the controlling serial input register. The resistance \nbetween the wiper and either endpoint of the fixed resistor \nvaries linearly with respect to the digital code transferred into the VR latch. Each variable resistor offers a completely programmable value of resistance between the A terminal and \nthe wiper or the B terminal and the wiper. The fixed A-to-B \nterminal resistance of 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 50 kΩ, or 100 kΩ has a ±1% channel-to-channel matching tolerance with a nominal temperature coefficient of 500 ppm/°C. A unique switching circuit minimizes the high glitch inherent in traditional switched resistor designs, avoiding any make-before-break  \nor break-before-make operation. \n(continued on Page 3) \n1 The terms digital potentiometer, VR, and RDAC are used interchangeably.

E | Page 3 of 32 GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n(continued from Page 1) \nEach VR has its own VR latch that holds its programmed \nresistance value. These VR latches are updated from an SPI-\ncompatible, serial-to-parallel shift register that is loaded from  \na standard 3-wire, serial-input digital interface. Ten data bits \nmake up the data-word clocked into the serial input register.  \nThe data-word is decoded where the first two bits determine  \nthe address of the VR latch to be loaded, and the last eight bits \nare the data. A serial data output pin at the opposite end of the serial register allows simple daisy chaining in multiple VR \napplications without additional external decoding logic. \nThe reset ( RS\n) pin forces the wiper to midscale by loading 80 H \ninto the VR latch. The SHDN  pin forces the resistor to an end-\nto-end open-circuit condition on the A terminal and shorts the \nwiper to the B terminal, achieving a microwatt power shutdown \nstate. When SHDN  is returned to logic high, the previous latch \nsettings put the wiper in the same resistance setting prior to \nshutdown. The digital interface is still active in shutdown so that code changes can be made that will produce new wiper \npositions when the device is taken out of shutdown. The AD8400 is available in the SOIC-8 surface mount. The \nAD8402 is available in both surface-mount (SOIC-14) and  \n14-lead PDIP packages, while the AD8403 is available in a \nnarrow-body, 24-lead PDIP and a 24-lead, surface-mount \npackage. The AD8402/AD8403 are also offered in the 1.1 mm thin TSSOP-14/TSSOP-24 packages for PCMCIA applications. \nAll parts are guaranteed to operate over the extended industrial \ntemperature range of −40°C to +125°C. \n \n \n \n \n \nAD8400/AD8402/AD8403  \n \nRev.

E | Page 20 of 32 THEORY OF OPERATION\nThe AD8400/AD8402/AD8403 provide a single, dual, and quad \nchannel, 256-position, digitally controlled variable resistor (VR) \ndevice. Changing the programmed VR setting is accomplished by clocking in a 10-bit serial data-word into the SDI (Serial Data Input) pin. The format of this data-word is two address bits, MSB first, followed by eight data bits, also MSB first.  \nTable 6  provides the serial register data-word format. The \nAD8400/AD8402/AD8403 have the following address assign-\nments for the ADDR decoder, which determines the location  of the VR latch receiving the serial register data in Bit B7 to  Bit B0: \nVR# = A1  × 2 + A0 + 1 (1) \nThe single-channel AD8400 requires A1 = A0 = 0. The dual-\nchannel AD8402 requires A1 = 0. VR settings can be changed \none at a time in random sequence. A serial clock running at  \n10 MHz makes it possible to load all four VRs under 4 μs  \n(10 × 4 × 100 ns) for AD8403. The exact timing requirements are shown in Figure 3 , Figure 4 , and Figure 5 . \nThe AD8400/AD8402/AD8403 do not have power-on midscale \npreset, so the wiper can be at any random position at power-up. However, the AD8402/AD8403 can be reset to midscale by \nasserting the RS\n pin, simplifying initial conditions at power-up. \nBoth parts have a power shutdown SHDN  pin that places the \nVR in a zero-power-consumption state where Terminal Ax is \nopen-circuited and the Wiper Wx is connected to Terminal Bx, resulting in the consumption of only the leakage current in the VR. In shutdown mode, the VR latch settings are maintained  \nso that upon returning to the operational mode, the VR settings \nreturn to the previous resistance values. The digital interface is still active in shutdown, except that SDO is deactivated. Code changes in the registers can be made during shutdown that will \nproduce new wiper positions when the device is taken out of \nshutdown. \nD7\nD6D5D4D3D2\nD1\nD0\nRDAC\nLATCH\nAND\nDECODERAx\nWx\nBx\nRS=RNOMINAL /256RSSHDN\nRSRS\nRS\n01092-044 \nFigure 45. AD8402/AD8403 Equivalent VR (RDAC) Circuit PROGRAMMING THE VARIABLE RESISTOR \nRheostat Operation \nThe nominal resistance of the VR (RDAC) between Terminal A \nand Terminal B is available with values of 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 50 kΩ, \nand 100 kΩ. The final digits of the part number determine the nominal resistance value; that is, 10 kΩ = 10; 100 kΩ = 100.  The nominal resistance (R\nAB) of the VR has 256 contact points \naccessible by the wiper terminal, and the resulting resistance can be measured either across the wiper and B terminals (R\nWB) \nor across the wiper and A terminals (R WA). The 8-bit data-word \nloaded into the RDAC latch is decoded to select one of the  256 possible settings. The wiper’s first connection starts at the  B terminal for data 00\nH. This B terminal connection has a wiper \ncontact resistance of 50 Ω. The second connection (for the 10 kΩ part) is the first tap point located at 89 Ω = [R\nAB (nominal \nresistance) + R W = 39 Ω + 50 Ω] for data 01 H. The third \nconnection is the next tap point representing 78 Ω + 50 Ω =  128 Ω for data 02\nH. Each LSB data value increase moves the \nwiper up the resistor ladder until the last tap point is reached at 10,011 Ω. Note that the wiper does not directly connect to the  B terminal even for data 00\nH. See Figure 45  for a simplified \ndiagram of the equivalent RDAC circuit. \nThe AD8400 contains one RDAC, the AD8402 contains  \ntwo independent RDACs, and the AD8403 contains four \nindependent RDACs. The general transfer equation that determines the digitally programmed output resistance  \nbetween Wx and Bx is \n()W AB WB R RDD R + × =256 (2) \nwhere D, in decimal, is the data loaded into the 8-bit RDAC# \nlatch, and RAB is the nominal end-to-end resistance. \nFor example, when the A terminal is either open-circuited or \ntied to the Wiper W , the following RDAC latch codes result in \nthe following R WB (for the 10 kΩ version): \nTable 10. \nD (Dec) RWB (Ω) Output State \n255 10,011 Full scale \n128 5,050 Midscale ( RS = 0 condition) \n1 89 1 LSB \n0 50 Zero-scale (wiper contact resistance) \nNote that in the zero-scale condition, a finite wiper resistance of  \n50 Ω is present. Care should be taken to limit the current flow between W and B in this state to a maximum value of 5 mA to avoid degradation or possible destruction of the internal switch \ncontact. \n \n  AD8400/AD8402/AD8403\n \nRev. E | Page 21 of 32 Like a mechanical potentiometer, RDAC is symmetrical. The \nresistance between the Wiper W and Terminal A also produces  \na digitally controlled complementary resistance, R WA. When \nthese terminals are used, the B terminal can be tied to the wiper \nor left floating. R WA starts at the maximum and decreases as the \ndata loaded into the RDAC latch increases. The general transfer \nequation for this R WA is \n()W AB WA R RDD R + ×−=256256 (3) \nwhere D is the data loaded into the 8-bit RDAC# latch, and RAB \nis the nominal end-to-end resistance.  \nFor example, when the B terminal is either open-circuited or \ntied to the Wiper W , the following RDAC latch codes result in \nthe following R WA (for the 10 kΩ version): \nTable 11. \nD (Dec) RWA (Ω) Output State \n255 89 Full-Scale \n128 5,050 Midscale ( RS = 0 Condition) \n1 10,011 1 LSB \n0 10,050 Zero-Scale \n \nThe typical distribution of RAB from channel to channel \nmatches within ±1%. However, device-to-device matching  \nis process lot dependent and has a ±20% variation. The tem-perature coefficient, or the change in R\nAB with temperature,  \nis 500 ppm/°C. \nThe wiper-to-end-terminal resistance temperature coefficient \nhas the best performance over the 10% to 100% of adjustment \nrange where the internal wiper contact switches do not con-\ntribute any significant temperature related errors. The graph in \nFigure 18  shows the performance of R WB tempco vs. code. Using \nthe potentiometer with codes below 32 results in the larger \ntemperature coefficients plotted. \nPROGRAMMING THE POTENTIOMETER DIVIDER \nVoltage Output Operation \nThe digital potentiometer easily generates an output voltage \nproportional to the input voltage applied to a given terminal. \nFor example, connecting the A terminal to 5 V and the B termi-\nnal to ground produces an output voltage at the wiper starting \nat 0 V up to 1 LSB less than 5 V . Each LSB is equal to the voltage applied across the A to B terminals divided by the 256-position resolution of the potentiometer divider. The general equation \ndefining the output voltage with respect to ground for any given \ninput voltage applied to the A to B terminals is \nB AB W V VDV + × =256 (4) \nOperation of the digital potentiometer in the voltage divider \nmode results in more accurate operation over temperature. Here the output voltage is dependent on the ratio of the internal \nresistors, not the absolute value; therefore, the temperature drift \nimproves to 15 ppm/°C. \nAt the lower wiper position settings, the potentiometer divider \ntemperature coefficient increases because the contribution of \nthe CMOS switch wiper resistance becomes an appreciable \nportion of the total resistance from the B terminal to the \nWiper W. See Figure 17  for a plot of potentiometer tempco \nperformance vs. code setting. \nDIGITAL INTERFACING \nThe AD8400/AD8402/AD8403 contain a standard SPI-\ncompatible, 3-wire, serial input control interface. The three \ninputs are clock (CLK), chip select ( CS), and serial data input \n(SDI). The positive-edge sensitive CLK input requires clean \ntransitions to avoid clocking incorrect data into the serial input register. For the best result, use logic transitions faster than 1 V/μs. Standard logic families work well. If mechanical switches are used for product evaluation, they should be debounced by  \na flip-flop or other suitable means. The block diagrams in \n, , and  show the internal digital \ncircuitry in more detail. When Figure 46 Figure 47 Figure 48\nCS\n is taken active low, the clock \nloads data into the 10-bit serial register on each positive clock \nedge (see ).

The pull-up \nresistor termination voltage may be larger than the V\nDD supply \n(but less than the max V DD of 8 V) of the AD8403 SDO output \ndevice. For example, the AD8403 could operate at V DD = 3.3 V , \nand the pull-up for interface to the next device could be set at 5 V . \nThis allows for daisy-chaining several RDACs from a single proc-essor serial data line. The clock period needs to be increased \nwhen using a pull-up resistor to the SDI pin of the following \ndevice in the series. Capacitive loading at the daisy-chain node SDO to SDI between devices must be accounted for in order to \ntransfer data successfully. When daisy chain is used, CS\n should \nbe kept low until all the bits of every package are clocked into \ntheir respective serial registers and the address and data bits are \nin the proper decoding location.  If two AD8403 RDACs are daisy-chained, it requires 20 bits  \nof address and data in the format shown in Table 6 . During \nshutdown ( SHDN  = logic low), the SDO output pin is forced  \nto the off (logic high) state to disable power dissipation in the \npull-up resistor. See  for equivalent SDO output circuit \nschematic. Figure 50\nThe data setup and hold times in the specification table deter-\nmine the data valid time requirements. The last 10 bits of the \ndata-word entered into the serial register are held when CS \nreturns high. At the same time CS goes high it gates the address \ndecoder, which enables one of the two (AD8402) or four (AD8403) \npositive edge-triggered RDAC latches. See  and . Figure 49 Table 13\nTable 13.

Channel-to-channel crosstalk measures less than −65 dB at f = 100 kHz. To achieve \nthis isolation, the extra ground pins provided on the package to \nsegregate the individual RDACs must be connected to circuit \nground. AGND and DGND pins should be at the same voltage potential. Any unused potentiometers in a package should be connected to ground. Power supply rejection is typically −35 dB at 10 kHz.

A major advantage of the digital potentiometer  is its programmability. Any settings can be saved for later recall in system memory. \nThe two major configurations of the RDAC include the \npotentiometer divider (basic 3-terminal application) and  the rheostat (2-terminal configuration) connections shown  \nin Figure 37  and Figure 38 . \nCertain boundary conditions must be satisfied for proper \nAD8400/AD8402/AD8403 operation. First, all analog signals \nmust remain within the GND to V\nDD range used to operate the \nsingle-supply AD8400/AD8402/AD8403. For standard \npotentiometer divider applications, the wiper output can be used directly. For low resistance loads, buffer the wiper with  a suitable rail-to-rail op amp such as the OP291 or the OP279. \nSecond, for ac signals and bipolar dc adjustment applications,  \na virtual ground is generally needed. Whichever method is used to create the virtual ground, the result must provide the necessary sink and source current for all connected loads, including adequate bypass capacitance. Figure 41  shows one channel of \nthe AD8402 connected in an inverting programmable gain \namplifier circuit. The virtual ground is set at 2.5 V , which allows \nthe circuit output to span a ±2.5 V range with respect to virtual \nground. The rail-to-rail amplifier capability is necessary for the widest output swing. As the wiper is adjusted from its midscale reset position (80\nH) toward the A terminal (code FF H), the \nvoltage gain of the circuit is increased in successively larger increments. Alternatively, as the wiper is adjusted toward the B terminal (code 00\nH), the signal becomes attenuated. The plot in \nFigure 54  shows the wiper settings for a 100:1 range of voltage \ngain (V/V). Note the ±10 dB of pseudologarithmic gain around \n0 dB (1 V/V). This circuit is mainly useful for gain adjustments \nin the range of 0.14 V/V to 4 V/V; beyond this range the step sizes become very large, and the resistance of the driving circuit \ncan become a significant term in the gain equation. Figure 54. Inverting Programmable Gain Plot \n \nACTIVE FILTER \nThe state variable active filter is one of the standard circuits \nused to generate a low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filter.  \nThe digital potentiometer allows full programmability of the \nfrequency, gain, and Q of the filter outputs. Figure 55  shows  \nthe filter circuit using a 2.5 V virtual ground, which allows a ±2.5 V\nP input and output swing. RDAC2 and RDAC3 set the  \nLP , HP , and BP cutoff and center frequencies, respectively. \nThese variable resistors should be programmed with the same \ndata (as with ganged potentiometers) to maintain the best Circuit Q. Figure 56  shows the measured filter response at the \nband-pass output as a function of the RDAC2 and RDAC3 settings that produce a range of center frequencies from 2 kHz to 20 kHz. The filter gain response at the band-pass output is \nshown in Figure 57 . At a center frequency of 2 kHz, the gain is \nadjusted over a −20 dB to +20 dB range determined by RDAC1. \nCircuit Q is adjusted by RDAC4.
