The operating input common-mode \nvoltage range extends from −4 V to +65 V with a 5 V supply. The AD8207 works with a single-supply voltage of 3.3 V to 5 V , and is ideally suited to withstand large input PWM common-\nmode voltages, typical in solenoid and motor control applications. \nThe AD8207 is available in an 8-lead SOIC package. Excellent \ndc performance over temperature keeps errors in the mea-\nsurement loop to a minimum. Offset drift is typically less  \nthan 500 nV/°C, and gain drift is typically below 10 ppm/°C.  \n The AD8207 is ideal for bidirectional current sensing \napplications. It features two reference  pins,V\nREF1 and V REF2,  \nthat allow the user to easily offset the output of the device to any voltage within the supply range. With V\nREF1 attached to the  \nV+ pin and V REF2 attached to the GND pin, the output is set at  \nhalf scale. Attaching both pins to GND causes the output to  be unipolar, starting near ground. Attaching both pins to V+ \nca\nuses the output to be unipolar starting near V+. Other output \noffsets are achieved by applying an external low impedance \nvoltage to the V REF1 and V REF2 pins. \n \n \nAD8207  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 2 of 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS \nFeatures .............................................................................................. 1  \nApplications ....................................................................................... 1  \nFunctional Block Diagram .............................................................. 1  \nGeneral Description ......................................................................... 1  \nRevision History ............................................................................... 2  \nSpecifications ..................................................................................... 3  \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings ............................................................ 4  \nESD Caution .................................................................................. 4  \nPin Configuration and Function Descriptions ............................. 5  \nTypical Performance Characteristics ............................................. 6  \nTheory of Operation ...................................................................... 10  \nPower Supply Adjustment ............................................................. 11  \n3.3 V to 4.5 V Supply Operation .............................................. 11  \n4.5 V to 5.5 V Supply Operation .............................................. 11  Output Offset Adjustment ............................................................ 12  \nUnidirectional Operation .......................................................... 12  \nBidirectional Operation ............................................................. 12  \nExternal Referenced Output ..................................................... 13  \nSplitting the Supply .................................................................... 13  \nSplitting an External Reference ................................................ 13  \nApplications Information .............................................................. 14  \nMotor Control ............................................................................. 14  \nSolenoid Control ........................................................................ 15  \nOutline Dimensions ....................................................................... 16  \nOrdering Guide .......................................................................... 16  \nAutomotive Products ................................................................. 16  \n \n \nREVISION HISTORY \n7/10—Revision 0: Initial Version \n  AD8207\n \nRev. 0 | Page 3 of 16 SPECIFICATIONS \nTOPR = −40°C to +125°C, V+ = 5 V or 3.3 V , unless otherwise noted.  \nTable 1.  \nParameter Min Typ Max Unit Test Conditions/Comments \nGAIN      \nInitial  20  V/V  \nAccuracy over Temperature −0.3  +0.3 % TOPR \nGain vs. Temperature −15  0 ppm/°C TOPR \nVOLTAGE OFFSET      \nOffset Voltage (RTI)1  ±100  μV  25°C \nOver Temperature (RTI)1   ±400 μV TOPR \nOffset Drift −1  +1 μV/°C TOPR \nINPUT      \nInput Impedance      \nDifferential  240  kΩ  \nCommon Mode  126  kΩ  \nInput Voltage Range −4  +65 V Common mode, continuous, V+ = 5 V, T OPR \n −4  +35 V Common mode continuous, V+ = 3.3 V, T OPR \n  250  mV Differential2, V+ = 5 V \nCommon-Mode Rejection (CMRR) 80 90  dB TOPR, f = dc to 20 kHz \nOUTPUT      \nOutput Voltage Range 0.02  V+ − 0.05 V RL = 25 kΩ, T OPR \nOutput Resistance  2  Ω  \nDYNAMIC RESPONSE      \nSmall-Signal −3 dB Bandwidth  150  kHz TOPR \nSlew Rate  1  V/μs  \nNOISE      \n0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, (RTI)1  20  μV p-p  \nSpectral Density, 1 kHz, (RTI)1  0.6  μV/√Hz  \nOFFSET ADJUSTMENT      \nRatiometric Accuracy3 0.497  0.503 V/V Divider to supplies, T OPR \nAccuracy (RTO)4   ±3 mV/V Voltage applied to V REF1 and V REF2 in parallel, \nTOPR \nOutput Offset Adjustment Range 0.02  V+ − 0.05 V TOPR \nVREF Input Voltage Range5 0.0  V+ V  \nVREF Divider Resistor Values  100  kΩ  \nPOWER SUPPLY      \nOperating Range 4.5  5.5 V RANGE (Pin 4) connected to GND6 \n 3.3  4.5 V RANGE (Pin 4) connected to V+7 \nQuiescent Current over Temperature   2.5 mA VO = 0.1 V dc \nPower Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) 80   dB  \nTEMPERATURE RANGE      \nFor Specified Performance −40  +125 °C  \n \n1 RTI = referred to input. \n2 Input voltage range = ±125 mV with half-scale offset.

Gain Drift Distribution \n \nAD8207  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 10 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8207 is a single-supply, zero drift, difference amplifier \nthat uses a unique architecture to accurately amplify small differential current shunt voltages in the presence of rapidly \nchanging common-mode voltage. \nIn typical applications, the AD8207 is used to measure current \nby amplifying the voltage across a shunt resistor connected to  its inputs.  \nThe AD8207 includes a zero-drift amplifier, a precision resistor \nnetwork, a common-mode control amplifier, and a precision \nreference (see Figure 25 ). \nA set of precision-trimmed resistors make up the network  \nthat attenuates the input common-mode voltage to within the supply range of the amplifier, in this case with a ratio of 20/1. This attenuation ensures that when the input pins are externally at the common-mode extremes of −4 V and +65 V , the actual \nvoltage at the inputs of the main amplifier is still within the \nsupply range.  \nThe input resistor network also attenuates normal (differential) \nmode voltages. Therefore, the total internal gain of the AD8207 \nis set to 400 V/V to provide a total system gain of 20 V/V .  \nTotal Gain (V/V) = 1/20 (V/V) × 400 (V/V) = 20 V/V \nThe AD8207 is designed to provide excellent common-mode \nrejection, even with PWM common-mode inputs that can \nchange at very fast rates, for example, 1 V/ns. An internal \ncommon-mode control amplifier is used to maintain the input \ncommon mode of the main amplifier at 3.5 V (with 5 V supply), and therefore eliminates the negative effects of such fast-\nchanging external common-mode variations.  \nThe AD8207 features an input offset drift of less than \n500 nV/°C. This performance is achieved through a novel zero-drift architecture that does not compromise band- width, which is typically rated at 150 kHz.  The reference inputs, V\nREF1 and V REF2, are tied through 100 kΩ \nresistors to the positive input of the main amplifier, which allows the output offset to be adjusted anywhere in the output operating range. The gain is 1 V/V from the reference pins to \nthe output when the reference pins are used in parallel. When \nthe pins are used to divide the supply, the gain is 0.5 V/V .  \nThe AD8207 offers breakthrough performance without \ncompromising any of the robust application needs typical  of solenoid or motor control. The part rejects PWM input \ncommon-mode voltages, while the zero-drift architecture yields \nthe lowest offset and offset drift performance on the market.  \nZERO-DRIFT\nAMPLIFIER\nAD8207COMMON-MODE\nCONTROL AMPLIFIER\n3.5V/2.2V\n REF60kΩ120kΩSHUNT\n120kΩ+IN\nGND–IN\nOUT\nVREF1\nVREF260kΩ9kΩ\n50kΩ 6kΩ 6kΩ\n09160-025100kΩ\n100kΩ\n100kΩ\n100kΩ100kΩ\n \nFigure 25.

This mode of operation is achieved by con-\nnecting the RANGE pin (Pin 4) to the supply (see Figure 26 ).  \nIt is recommended that an external resistor be placed in series \nfrom the RANGE pin to the supply. This resistor can be a \ntypical 5 kΩ 1% resistor.  \n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5AD8207\nTOP VIEW\n(Not to Scale)3.3V3.3V\nOUTSHUNT\n09160-010 \nFigure 26. 3.3 V Supply Operation \nNote that in this mode of operation, the common-mode range \nof the AD8207 is limited to −4 V to +35 V . The output and reference input ranges are limited to the supply of the part. The user can have a 4.5 V supply and connect the RANGE pin from \n3.3 V to 4.5 V . Alternatively, the user can connect the RANGE \npin as high as 4.5 V , with the supply from 3.3 V to 4.5 V .  4.5 V TO 5.5 V SUPPLY OPERATION \nIn most applications, the AD8207 operates with a single 5 V \nsupply. In this mode, the operating input common-mode  \nrange of the AD8207 is rated from −4 V to +65 V . To operate the device with a 5 V supply (includes 4.5 V to 5.5 V), connect \nthe RANGE pin (Pin 4) to logic low, or GND, as shown in \nFigure 27 .  \n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5AD8207\nTOP VIEW\n(Not to Scale)5V\nOUTSHUNT\n09160-011 \nFigure 27. 5 V Supply Bidirectional Operation \nThe output and reference input ranges are limited to the  \nsupply voltage used. With a supply voltage from 4.5 V to 5.5 V , the RANGE pin (Pin 4) should be connected to GND to achieve the maximum input common-mode range specification of −4 V to +65 V . \n \n \nAD8207  \n \nRev. 0 | Page 12 of 16 OUTPUT OFFSET ADJUSTMENT \nThe output of the AD8207 can be adjusted for unidirectional or \nbidirectional operation.  \nUNIDIRECTIONAL OPERATION \nUnidirectional operation allows the AD8207 to measure \ncurrents through a resistive shunt in one direction. The basic \nmodes for unidirectional operation are ground referenced  \noutput mode and V+ referenced output mode. \nFor unidirectional operation, the output can be set at the \nnegative rail (near ground) or at the positive rail (near V+) \nwhen the differential input is 0 V . The output moves to the \nopposite rail when a correct polarity differential input voltage  is applied. In this case, full scale is approximately 250 mV for a 5 V supply or 165 mV for a 3.3 V supply. The required polarity \nof the differential input depends on the output voltage setting.  \nIf the output is set at the positive rail, the input polarity must  \nbe negative to move the output down. If the output is set at \nground, the polarity must be positive to move the output up.  \nGround Referenced Output Mode \nWhen using the AD8207 in the ground referenced output mode, \nboth reference inputs are tied to ground, which causes the output to \nsit at the negative rail when there are 0 differential volts at the input \n(see Figure 28 ). \nREFZERO\nDRIFT+IN\n–INOUTV+\nGNDVREF1\nVREF2RANGEAD82075V\n09160-012 \nFigure 28.

In this case, the \noutput is set anywhere within the output range. Typically, it  is set at half scale for equal range in both directions. In some cases, however, it is set at a voltage other than half scale when the bidirectional current is asymmetrical. \nTable 6.

V REF1 and V REF2 are tied to internal \nresistors that connect to an internal offset node. There is no \noperational difference between the pins.  \n  AD8207\n \nRev. 0 | Page 13 of 16 EXTERNAL REFERENCED OUTPUT \nTying both reference pins together and to an external reference \nproduces an output equal to the reference voltage when there is \nno differential input (see Figure 30 ). The output moves down \nfrom the reference voltage when the input is negative, relative  \nto the −IN pin, and up when the input is positive, relative to the \n−IN pin. The reference pins are connected to the positive input of the main amplifier via precision-trimmed 100 kΩ resistors. Therefore, it is recommended that a low impedance voltage is always be used to set the reference voltage. If external resistors \nare connected directly to the V\nREF1 and V REF2 pins, there will  \nbe a mismatch with the internal trimmed resistors, leading to \noffset gain accuracy reduction.  \nRANGEV+5V\nREF+IN\n–INOUT\nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCE\nGNDAD8207ZERO\nDRIFT\nVREF1\nVREF22.5V\n09160-014 \nFigure 30. External Referenced Output, V+ = 5 V \nSPLITTING THE SUPPLY \nBy tying one reference pin to V+ and the other to the ground \npin, the output is set at half of the supply when there is no dif-\nferential input (see Figure 31 ). The benefit is that no external \nreference is required to offset the output for bidirectional current \nmeasurement. This creates a midscale offset that is ratiometric to \nthe supply, which means that if the supply increases or decreases, the output remains at half the supply. For example, if the supply is 5.0 V , the output is at half scale, or 2.5 V . If the supply increases by \n10% (to 5.5 V), the output goes to 2.75 V .

Additionally, the typical  low offset drift of 500 nV/°C means that the measurement  error between the two motor phases will be at a minimum  over temperature. The AD8207 rejects PWM input common-\nmode voltages in the range of −4 V to +65 V (with a 5 V \nsupply). Monitoring the current on the motor phase allows  for sampling of the current at any point and allows for diagnostic information such as a short to GND and battery. \nRefer to Figure 34  for a typical phase current measurement \nsetup with the AD8207.  \nH-Bridge Motor Control \nAnother typical application for the AD8207 is as part of  \nthe control loop in H-bridge motor control. In this case, the \nshunt resistor is placed in the middle of the H-bridge (see Figure 33 ) so that it can accurately measure current in both directions by using the shunt available at the motor. This is  a better solution than a ground referenced op amp because ground is not typically a stable reference voltage in this type  of application. The instability of the ground reference causes \ninaccuracies in the measurements that could be made with a \nsimple ground referenced op amp. The AD8207 measures \ncurrent in both directions as the H-bridge switches and the \nmotor changes direction. The output of the AD8207 is config-ured in an external referenced bidirectional mode (see the Bidirectional Operation  section). \nAD8207+IN\nSHUNTMOTORVREF1+VSOUT\n–IN GND5VCONTROLLER\nVREF2R A N G E5V\n2.5V\n09160-020  \nFigure 33.

Typical \napplications include hydraulic valve control, diesel injection \ncontrol, and actuator control. \nIn Figure 35 , the PWM control switch is ground referenced. An \ninductive load (solenoid) is tied to a power supply. A resistive \nshunt is placed between the switch and the load (see Figure 35 ). \nAn advantage of placing the shunt on the high side is that the entire current, including the recirculation current, can be measured because the shunt remains in the loop when the switch is off. In addition, diagnostics capabilities are enhanced because shorts to ground can be detected with the shunt on  \nthe high side. In this circuit configuration, when the switch  \nis closed, the common-mode voltage moves down to near the negative rail. When the switch is opened, the voltage reversal across the inductive load causes the common-mode voltage to \nbe held one diode drop above the battery by the clamp diode. \nAD8207+IN\n42V\nBATTERYCLAMP\nDIODEINDUCTIVE\nLOAD\nSHUNT\nSWITCHVREF1+VS5V\nOUT\n–IN GND VREF2 RANGE\n09160-018 \nFigure 35. Low-Side Switch High-Side Current Sense with a High-Side Switch \nThis configuration minimizes the possibility of unexpected \nsolenoid activation and excessive corrosion (see Figure 36 ). In \nFigure 36 , both the switch and the shunt are on the high side. \nWhen the switch is off, the battery is removed from the load, which prevents damage from potential shorts to ground, while still allowing the recirculation current to be measured and providing for diagnostics. Removing the power supply from the \nload for the majority of the time minimizes the corrosive effects \nthat can be caused by the differential voltage between the load \nand ground. When using a high-side switch, the battery voltage is connected to the load when the switch is closed, causing the common-mode voltage to increase to the battery voltage. When \nthe switch is opened, the voltage reversal across the inductive \nload causes the common-mode voltage to be held one diode \ndrop below ground by the clamp diode. \nAD8207+IN\n42V\nBATTERY\nCLAMP\nDIODE\nINDUCTIVE\nLOADSHUNTSWITCH\nVREF1+VS5V\nOUT\n–IN GND VREF2 RANGE\n09160-019 \nFigure 36.
