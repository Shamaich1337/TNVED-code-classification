It will present a high impedance tothe protected line up to 3.3 volts.  It will “turn on”when the line voltage exceeds 3.5 volts.

The structure of the EPDTVS is vastly different from the traditional pn-junctiondevices.  At voltages below 5V, high leakage currentand junction capacitance render conventional ava-lanche technology impractical for most applications.However, by utilizing the EPD technology, these devicescan effectively operate at 3.3V while maintainingexcellent electrical characteristics.\nThe EPD TVS employs a complex nppn structure in\ncontrast to the pn structure normally found in tradi-tional silicon-avalanche TVS diodes.  The EPD mecha-nism is achieved by engineering the center region ofthe device such that the reverse biased junction doesnot avalanche, but will “punch-through”  to a conduct-ing state.  This structure results in a device with supe-rior dc electrical parameters at low voltages whilemaintaining the capability to absorb high transientcurrents.\nMatte Tin Lead Finish\nMatte tin has become the industry standard lead-free\nreplacement for SnPb lead finishes.  A matte tin finishis composed of 100% tin solder with large grains.Since the solder volume on the leads is small com-pared to the solder paste volume that is placed on theland pattern of the PCB, the reflow profile will bedetermined by the requirements of the solder paste.Therefore, these devices are compatible with bothlead-free and SnPb assembly techniques.  In addition,unlike other lead-free compositions, matte tin does nothave any added alloys that can cause degradation ofthe solder joint.Device Schematic & Pin Configuration\nApplications Information\nIPP\nISB\nIPT\nIR\nVRWM VVPTVCVF\nIFSBEPD TVS IV Characteristic Curve\n5 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSPROTECTION PRODUCTSuClamp3301D\nOutline Drawing - SOD-323\nc.010.005\n.014-.000\n.0120.36\n--\n-\n0.35 .018.008\n0.250.13.046\n.004.016 0.300.000.91\n0.450.20 -0.401.17\n0.10\n--\n-\nAH\n2.DIMENSIONS "E1" AND "D" DO NOT INCLUDE MOLD FLASH, PROTRUSIONS\nOR GATE BURRS.CONTROLLING DIMENSIONS ARE IN INCHES (ANGLES IN DEGREES).NOTES:\n1.SIDE VIEWNOMINCHESDIMENSIONS\nDIM\nb\nE1\nL\nNEDcA1\nA2AMINMILLIMETERS\nMAX MIN NOM MAX\n.097 .102 .107 2.46 2.59 2.72\n2\nSEE DETAILA1AA2D\nAE1 E\n.060.044\n.065.050.013 -\n21.641.28\n.070.054\n1.501.18.017 0.33\n1.781.370.43 -\nLGAGE\nPLANE\n0.008\nDETAIL\nLand Pattern - SOD-323\n(.085) (2.15)\nZ G\nY(C) 0.90 .035\n0.53 .021\n1.25 .049\n3.40 .134X\nINCHESDIMENSIONS\nZYXDIM\nC\nGMILLIMETERS\nTHIS LAND PATTERN IS FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY.\nCONSULT YOUR MANUFACTURING GROUP TO ENSURE YOUR\nCOMPANY\'S MANUFACTURING GUIDELINES ARE MET.NOTES:\n1.\n6 \uf8e9 2005 Semtech Corp.www.semtech.comPROTECTION PRODUCTSPROTECTION PRODUCTSuClamp3301D\nContact Information\nSemtech Corporation\nProtection Products Division\n200 Flynn Rd., Camarillo, CA 93012\nPhone: (805)498-2111   FAX (805)498-3804rebmuNtraPgnikroW\negatloVrepytQ\nleeReziSleeR\nTCT.D1033pmalCuV 3.30 00,3” 7Marking Code Ordering Information\n3U\nMicroClamp, uClamp, and µClamp are marks of Semtech Corporation\n'}]
