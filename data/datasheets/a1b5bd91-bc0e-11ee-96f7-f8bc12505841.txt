Optical Characteristics\nNote: \n1. Viewing angle is the angle at which the contrast ratio is greater than 10. The viewing are\ndetermined for the horizontal or 3, 9 o’clock direction and the vertical or 6, 12 o’clock \ndirection with respect to the optical axis which is normal to the LCD surface (see FIG.2). \n2. Contrast measurements shall be made at viewing angle of Θ= 0 and at the center of theLCD surface. Luminance shall be measured with all pixels in the view field set first to white,\nthen to the dark (black) state. (See FIG. 2) Luminance Contrast Ratio (CR) is defined mathematically. CR = White Luminance (ON) / Black Luminance (OFF) \n3. Transmittance is the value with DBEF Polarizer.4. The color chromaticity coordinates specified in Table1 shall be calculated from the spectral\ndata measured with all pixels first in red, green, blue and white. Measurements shall be made at the center of the C/F. Measurement condition is C - light source & Halogen Lamp  \n5. The electro-optical response time measurements shall be made as FIG.3 by switching the\n“data” input signal ON and OFF. The times needed for the luminance to change from 10% to 90% is Tr , and 90% to 10% is Tf.  \n4.2 Optical Specifications \n<Table 1. Optical Specifications>\nParameter Symbol Condition Min. M ax.

However those phenomena do not mean malfunction or out of order with LCD’s, \nwhich will come back in the specified operation temperature. \n\uf06cIf the display area is pushed hard during operation, some font will be abnormally displayed\nbut it resumes normal condition after turning off once.\n\uf06cA slight dew depositing on terminals is a cause for electro-chemical reaction resulting in\nterminal open circuit.\nUsage under the maximum operating temperature, 50%Rh or less is required.\n\n12.6 storage  \nIn the case of storing for a long period of time for instance, for years for the purpose or \nreplacement use, the following ways are recommended.  \n\uf06cS\ntorage in a polyethylene bag with the opening sealed so as not to enter fresh air outside in it .\nAnd with no desiccant.\n\uf06cPlacing in a dark place where neither exposure to direct sunlight nor light’s keeping the\nstorage temperature range.\n\uf06cStoring with no touch on polarizer surface by the anything else.\n[It is recommended to store them as they have been contained in the inner container at the\ntime of delivery from us\n12.7 Safety  \n\uf06cIt is recommendable to crash damaged or unnecessary LCD’s into pieces and wash off liquid\ncrystal by either of solvents such as acetone and ethanol, which should be burned up later.\n\uf06cWhen any liquid leaked out of a damaged glass cell comes in contact with your hands, please\nwash it off well with soap and water\n13. Precaution For Use\n13.1 \nA limit sample should be provided by the both parties on an occasion when the both parties \nagreed its necessity. Judgment by a limit sample shall take effect after the limit sample has been \nestablished and confirmed by the both parties. \n13.2  \nOn the following occasions, the handing of problem should be decided through discussion and \nagreement between responsible of the both parties. \n\uf06cWhen a question is arisen in this specification\n\uf06cWhen a new problem is arisen which is not specified in this specifications\n\uf06cWhen an inspection specifications change or operating condition change in customer is\nreported to LTK LCD , and some problem is arisen in this specification due to the change\n\uf06cWhen a new problem is arisen at the customer’s operating set for sample evaluation in the\ncustomer site.\n14.
