When\nOE is low, the devices pass data from the A inputs to the Y outputs. When OE  is high, the outputs are in the\nhigh-impedance state.\nTo ensure the high-impedance state during power up or power down, OE  should be tied to V CC through a pullup\nresistor; the minimum value of the resistor is determined by the current-sinking capability of the driver.\nActive bus-hold circuitry is provided to hold unused or floating data inputs at a valid logic level. Use of pullup\nor pulldown resistors with the bus-hold circuitry is not recommended.\nThese devices are fully specified for hot-insertion applications using I off and power-up 3-state. The I off circuitry\ndisables the outputs, preventing damaging current backflow through the devices when they are powered down.\nThe power-up 3-state circuitry places the outputs in the high-impedance state during power up and power down,which prevents driver conflict.\nterminal assignments\n1234\nA 1A1 1OE VCC 2OE\nB 1A2 2A4 2Y4 1Y1\nC 1A3 2Y3 2A3 1Y2\nD 1A4 2A2 2Y2 1Y3\nE GND 2Y1 2A1 1Y4\nFUNCTION TABLE\n(each buffer)\nINPUTS OUTPUT\nOE AOUTPUT\nY\nL H H\nL LL\nH X ZSN74LVTH244A . . .

Antimony trioxide based\nflame retardants must also meet the <=1000ppm threshold requirement.\n \n(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.\nAddendum-Page 2\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 2-Aug-2022\n \n(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.\n \n(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation\nof the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.\n \n(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line.

### Component Summary: SN74LVTH244APW

#### Key Characteristics and Specifications:
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (V_CC): 2.7 V to 3.6 V
  - Input Voltage (V_I): -0.5 V to 7 V
  - Output Voltage (V_O): -0.5 V to 7 V (high-impedance state) and -0.5 V to V_CC + 0.5 V (high state)

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Maximum Output Current (I_O):
    - SN74LVTH244A: 128 mA (low state), 64 mA (high state)
    - SN54LVTH244A: 96 mA (low state), 48 mA (high state)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Supply Current (I_CC): 0.39 mA (outputs high), 14 mA (outputs low), and 0.19 mA (outputs disabled)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - SN74LVTH244A: -40 °C to 85 °C
  - SN54LVTH244A: -55 °C to 125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - Available in multiple packages including TSSOP (PW), SOIC (DW), SSOP (DB), and VQFN (RGY).

- **Special Features:**
  - Supports mixed-mode signal operation (5-V input/output with 3.3-V V_CC).
  - Active bus-hold circuitry to maintain valid logic levels on unused inputs.
  - Hot-insertion capability with I_off and power-up 3-state support.
  - ESD protection exceeding JESD 22 standards (2000-V Human-Body Model, 200-V Machine Model).
  - Latch-up performance exceeds 500 mA per JESD 17.

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level 1 per JEDEC J-STD-020E.

#### Description:
The SN74LVTH244APW is a 3.3-V ABT octal buffer/driver with 3-state outputs. It is designed to provide a TTL-compatible interface for low-voltage applications while allowing for higher voltage levels on the input and output. The device consists of two 4-bit line drivers with separate output-enable inputs, enabling data to be passed from the A inputs to the Y outputs when the output-enable (OE) signal is low. When OE is high, the outputs enter a high-impedance state.

#### Typical Applications:
The SN74LVTH244A is commonly used in:
- **Data Bus Applications:** It can drive data lines in systems where multiple devices share a common bus.
- **Signal Conditioning:** Buffers signals to ensure integrity and reduce loading effects on the driving source.
- **Level Shifting:** Facilitates communication between 3.3 V and 5 V systems, making it suitable for mixed-voltage environments.
- **Hot-Swap Applications:** Its hot-insertion capability allows for safe addition or removal of devices in live systems without causing damage.

This component is ideal for use in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and industrial applications where reliable signal buffering and level shifting are required.
