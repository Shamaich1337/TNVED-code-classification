The HFBR-0500Z series includes trans-\nmitters, receivers, connec  tors and cable specified for  \neasy design. This series of compo nents is ideal for  \nsolving problems with voltage isolation/insula  tion,  \nEMI/RFI immunity or data security. The optical link  \ndesign  is simpli fied by the logic compat ible receivers \nand complete specifi-cations for each component. The \nkey optical and electrical parameters of links configured \nwith the HFBR-0500Z family are fully guaranteed from \n0° to 70°C.\nA wide variety of package config u ra tions and connectors \nprovide the designer with numerous mechanical solutions \nto meet application requirements. The transmitter and \nreceiver compo nents have been designed for use in high \nvolume/low cost assembly processes such as auto inser -\ntion and wave soldering.\nTransmitters incorporate a 660 nm LED. Receivers  \ninclude a monolithic dc coupled, digital IC receiver  \nwith open collector Schottky output transistor. An  \ninternal pullup resistor is avail able for use in the  \nHFBR-25X1Z/2Z/4Z receivers. A shield has been in-\ntegrated into the receiver IC to provide additional,  \nlocalized noise immunity.\nInternal optics have been optim ized for use with 1 mm di-\nameter plastic optical fiber. Versatile Link specifications in-\ncorporate all connector interface losses. Therefore, optical \ncalculations for common link applications are simplified.\n\n2Link Selection Guide\n(Links specified from 0 to 70°C, for plastic optical fiber unless specified.)\n Signal Rate Distance (m) 25°C Distance (m) Transmitter Receiver\n 40 kBd 120 110 HFBR-1523Z HFBR-2523Z\n 1 MBd 20 10 HFBR-1524Z HFBR-2524Z\n 1 MBd 55 45 HFBR-1522Z HFBR-2522Z\n 5 Mbd 30 20 HFBR-1521Z HFBR-2521Z\nVALOX® is a registered trademark of the General Electric Corporation.Package and Handling Information\nThe compact Versatile Link pack  age is made of a flame \nretardant VALOX® UL 94 V-0 material (UL file # E121562) \nand uses the same pad layout as a standard, eight pin \ndual-in-line package. Vertical and horizontal mountable \nparts are available. These low profile Versa  tile Link pack -\nages are stackable and are enclosed to provide a dust \nresistant seal. Snap action simplex, simplex latching, \nduplex, and duplex latching connectors are offered with \nsimplex or duplex cables.Package Orientation\nPerformance and pinouts for the vertical and hori-\nzontal packages are identical. To provide addi tional  \nattachment support for the vertical Versatile Link  \nhousing, the designer has the option of using a self-\ntapping screw through a printed circuit board into a \nmounting hole at the bottom of the package. For most \napplications this is not necessary.\nPackage Housing Color\nVersatile Link components and simplex connectors are \ncolor coded to eliminate confusion when making connec -\ntions. Receivers are blue and transmit ters are gray, except \nfor the HFBR-15X3Z transmitter, which is black.HFBR-0500Z Series Part Number Guide\n                    HFBR X5XXZ               \n \n 1 = Transmitter \n 2 = Receiver Z = RoHS-compliant     \n \n 5 = 660 nm Transmitter and \n    Receiver Products 1 = 5 MBd High Performance Link\n  2 = 1 MBd High Performance Link\n  3 = 40 kBd Low Current/Extended Distance Link\n 2 = Horizontal Package 4 = 1 MBd Standard Link\n 3 = Vertical Package 6 = 155 MBd Receiver\n  7 = 155 MBd Transmitter\n  8 = 10 MBd High Performance Link\n3Handling\nVersatile Link components are auto-insertable. When  \nwave soldering is performed with Versatile Link compo -\nnents, the optical port plug should be left in to prevent \ncontamination of the port. Do not use reflow solder \nprocesses (i.e., infrared reflow or vapor-phase reflow). \nNonhalogenated water soluble fluxes (i.e., 0% chloride), \nnot rosin based fluxes, are recom mended for use with \nVersatile Link components.\nVersatile Link components are moisture sensitive \ndevices and are shipped in a moisture sealed bag. If the \ncomponents are exposed to air for an extended period of \ntime, they may require a baking step before the solder -\ning process. Refer to the special labeling on the shipping \ntube for details.Recommended Chemicals for Cleaning/Degreasing\nAlcohols: methyl, isopropyl, isobutyl. Aliphatics: hexane, \nheptane. Other: soap solution, naphtha.\nDo not use partially halogenated hydrocarbons such \nas 1,1.1 trichloroethane, ketones such as MEK, acetone, \nchloroform, ethyl acetate, methylene dichloride, phenol, \nmethylene chloride, or N-methylpyrolldone. Also, Avago \ndoes not recommend the use of cleaners that use  \nhalogenated hydrocarbons because of their potential \nenvironmental harm.\nMechanical Dimensions\nHorizontal Modules             Vertical Modules\n6.86\n(0.270)\n10.16\n(0.400)\n4.19\n(0.165)\n1.27\n(0.050)\n2.54\n(0.100)0.51\n(0.020)18.8\n(0.74)2.03\n(0.080)\n7.62\n(0.30)0.64\n(0.025)\n7.62\n(0.300)\n2.77\n(0.109)1.85\n(0.073)0.64 (0.025) DIA.5.08\n(0.200)\n3.81 (0.150) MAX.\n3.56 (0.140) MIN.\n2.03\n(0.080)10.16\n(0.400)5.08\n(0.200)\n6.86\n(0.27)\n18.80\n(0.740)18.29\n(0.720)\n4Versatile Link Printed Board Layout Dimensions\nHorizontal Module Vertical Module\nInterlocked (Stacked) Assemblies (refer to Figure 1)\nHorizontal packages may be stacked by placing units \nwith pins facing upward. Initially engage the inter  - \nlocking mechanism by sliding the L bracket body from \nabove into the L slot body of the lower package. Use \na straight edge, such as a ruler, to bring all stacked \nunits into uniform alignment. This tech nique prevents \npotential harm that could occur to fingers and hands of \nassemblers from the package pins. Stacked horizontal packages can be disengaged if necessary. Repeated stack -\ning and unstack  ing causes no damage to individual units.\nTo stack vertical packages, hold one unit in each hand, \nwith the pins facing away and the optical ports on the \nbottom. Slide the L bracket unit into the L slot unit. The \nstraight edge used for horizontal package alignment is \nnot needed.\nStacking Horizontal Modules \nFigure 1.
