A.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe SGM2578A  is a single  load switch with reverse \ncurrent prot ection and controlled turn- on. The device \ncan operate from 1V to 5.5V single supply and has the \nability to drive up to 2A continuous current . \nThe device contains a 30m Ω  l o w  R ON N-MOSFET  \ncontrolled by the ON pin. When the power supply is \nturned on for the first time, a smart pull -down resistor is \nused to float the ON pin until the system is stable. Once \nthe ON pin reaches a high voltage (>  VIH), the pull-down \nresistor is disconnected, then the standby current is very low and power loss  can be reduced . The small package \nand low R\nON make the device very suitable for space \nlimited, battery powered applications.  \nThe device supports a wide input voltage range, which is suitable  for many different voltage rails . The rise time \nis used to avoid inrush current. The SGM2578A  offers \nthe quick output discharge function in disable status.  \nThe SGM 2578A  is available in a Green WLCSP-  \n0.9×0.9-4B-A package.

A low \non-resistance N-MOSFET is integrated, which makes a \nlow voltage drop across the  device. To choose suitable  \nrise tim e is alw ays used to avoid inrush current.  \n \nControl Pin \nThe ON pin can control the device. Pullin g the ON pin \nhigh enables the device.  Logic high of  VIH on the ON \npin will enable  the device  and VIL will turn off  it. It has \nthe ability to interface with low -voltage GPIO. It can \nsupport  with 1.8V , 2.5V, 3.3V GPIO s. \n \nQuick Output Discharge  \nThe quick output discharge  (QOD ) feature is available \nfor SGM 2578 A. If the ON pin  is pulled low, a discharge \nresistor of 2 80Ω (TYP) is connected between VOUT \nand GND pins to prevent the output from floating when \nthe switch is disabled.  Functional Modes  \nThe connection of the VOUT pin is shown in Table 1. \nTable 2 shows the smart -ON functions.  \nTable 1. VOUT Connection  \nON Pin VOUT Pin  \nL GND \nH VIN \n \nTable 2.

The device \nhas a wide input range, which can be used in different \nend equipment to set power sequence, reduce inrush \ncurrent and maintain low standby leakage current.

Typical Application Circuit  Input Capacitor  \nA 1μF input capacitor (C IN) is recommended to use \nbetween VIN and GND close to the device pins.  It can \nlimit the voltage drop on the input supply. Larger C IN \ncan reduce voltage dip in high current applications.  \n \nOutput Capacitor  \nA 0.1μF output capacitor (C OUT) should be placed \nbetween VOUT and GND close to the device pins . This \ncapacitor will prevent parasitic board inductances from \nforcing V OUT below GND when the switch is turned off. \nTo improve the VIN dropping when the device is turned \non, it is recommended that C IN is placed greater than \nCOUT, due to the C IN is charge for C OUT. \n \n \n  \n 5.5V, 2A, 30mΩ RON Load Switch with \nSGM2578A  Reverse Current  Protection \n \n \n11 \nJANUARY 2022 \n \nSG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  \nReverse Current Protectio n \nIf the ON pin is pulled low, the device is disabled, while \nVIN > 1V or V OUT > 1V  is met, the  reverse current \nprotection f unction is activated. This function prevents \nthe current flow ing from VOUT to VIN , and is very \nuseful when SGM2578 A is disabled and the output \nneeds  to be driven by another voltage source.  \nVOUTVSRC\nVIH\nVSRC - (IOUT × R ON)\nIOUTVFORCE\nIRC_VINRCP Disabled RCP Enabled\nDue to QOD\n0VVONVIN\n0V\nIVIN\n \nNOTES: V SRC is the input power supply to the equipment. \nVFORCE  is the external power source forced at VOUT pin. I VIN \nis the current of VIN pin. I OUT is output load current.  \nFigure 5. Reverse Current Protection  Figure 5 shows how the reverse current protection circuit \nis activated  in SGM2578A . Pulling the ON pin down, the \ndevice is shut down and an external voltage (VFORCE ) is \nforced to VOUT pin, the  reverse current is tested very \nsmall given by I RC_VIN . This will prevent any large  extra \ncurrent reverse f rom the V FORCE  (added on V OUT) to V IN. \n \nPower Supply Recommendations  \nThe SGM2578 A is design ed for a wide operate input \nvoltage  range of 1V to 5.5V. Place a  1μF input bypass \ncapacitor close to the device terminal is recommended.  \n \nPower Supply Sequencing without a GPIO \nInput  \nIn many terminal devices, each module needs to be \npowered up in a pre- determined manner . SGM2578 A \ncan set a power sequenc e by the t DELAY  without extra \nGPIO, and may reduce inrush current. Figure 6 shows \nthe sequence that the ON pin of first load switch is tied \nto the VIN, and the second load switch ON pin is tied to \nthe VOUT of first load switch. The second load switch is \npowered up when the first load switch is turned on, this \nis the fixed sequence and the delay time set by default t\nDELAY . \n \nSGM 2578 AModule 1\nModule 2\nSGM 2578ACIN COUT1\nCOUT2VIN VOUT\nON GND\nVINVOUT ON\nGNDPower Supply\n \nFigure 6.
