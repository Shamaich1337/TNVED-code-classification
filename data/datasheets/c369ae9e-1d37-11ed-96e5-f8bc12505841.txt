The unity-gain follower  (buffer) is the most sensitive \nconfiguration to capacitive loading. Direct capacitive loading \nreduces the phase margin of amplifiers and this results in \nringing or even oscillation. Applications that require greater \ncapacitive drive capability should use an isolation resistor \nbetween the output and the capacitive load like the circuit in \nFigure 1. The isolation resistor R ISO and the load capacitor C L \nform a zero to increase stability. The bigger the R ISO resistor \nvalue, the more stable V OUT will be. Note that this method \nresults in a loss of gain accuracy because R ISO forms a voltage \ndivider with the R LOAD. \n \n \nVINVOUT SGM8521\nCLRISO\n \n \n \nFigure 1. Indirectly Driving Heavy Capacitive Load \n \nAn improvement circuit is shown in Figure 2, It provides DC \naccuracy as well as AC stability. R F provides the DC accuracy \nby connecting the inverting signal with the output, C F and R Iso \nserve to counteract the loss of phase margin by feeding the \nhigh frequency component of the output signal back to the \namplifier’s inverting input, thereby preserving phase margin in the overall feedback loop. \n \nVINVOUT SGM8521\nCLRISO\nRLRFCF\n \n \n \nFigure 2. Indirectly Driving Heavy Capacitive Load with DC \nAccuracy  \n \nFor no-buffer configuration, there are two others ways to \nincrease the phase margin: (a) by increasing the amplifier’s \ngain or (b) by placing a capacitor in parallel with the feedback resistor to counteract the parasitic capacitance associated with inverting node. \n  \n \n \n   \n Power-Supply Bypassing and Layout \n \nThe SGM852X family operates from either a single +2.5V to \n+5.5V supply or dual ±1.25V to ±2.75V supplies. For \nsingle-supply operation, bypass the power supply V DD with a \n0.1µF ceramic capacitor which should be placed close to the \nVDD pin. For dual-supply operation, both the V DD and the V SS \nsupplies should be bypassed to ground with separate 0.1 µF \nceramic capacitors. 2.2 µF tantalum capacitor can be added for \nbetter performance. \n \n \nSGM8521VDD\nVn\nVp\nVSSVOUT10µF\n0.1µF\n10µF\n0.1µFSGM8521Vn\nVpVDD\nVSS(GND)VOUT10µF\n0.1µF\n \n  \nFigure 3.
