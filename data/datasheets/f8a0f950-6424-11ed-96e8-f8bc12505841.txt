The PEX8714  is well suited for \nfan-out, aggregation , and peer-to-peer applications.  \n \nMulti -Host Architecture  \nThe PEX 8714  employs  an enhanced architecture , which allows users to \nconfigure the device in legacy single -host mode or multi -host mode with up \nto two host ports by using NT capability. This powerful architectural \nenhancement enables users to build PCIe based systems to support high -\navailability, failover, redundant and clustered systems.      \n \nHigh Performance & Low Packet Latency  \nThe PEX 8714  architecture supports packet cut-thru  with a maximum \nlatency of 158ns (x4 to x4). This, combined with large packet memory , \nflexible common buffer/FC credit pool  and non -blocking internal switch \narchitecture, provides full line rate on all ports for performance -hungry \napplications such as servers and switch fabrics . The low latency enables \napplications to achieve high throughput and performance. In addition to low \nlatency, the device supports a packet payload size of up to 2048 bytes, \nenabling the user to achieve even higher throughput.  \n \nData Integrit y \nThe PEX 8714  provides  end-to-end CRC  (ECRC) protection and Poison  bit \nsupport to enable designs that require end-to-end data integrity . PLX also \nsupports data path parity and memory (RAM) error correction  circuitry \nthroughout the internal data paths as packets pass through the switch.  \n \nFlexible Configuration  \nThe PEX 8714 ’s 5 ports can be configured \nto lane widths of x 2, x4, or x 8. Flexible \nbuffer allocation, along with the device's \nflexible packet flow control,  maximizes \nthroughput for applications where more \ntraffic flows in the downstream, rather \nthan upstream, direction.  Any port can be \ndesignated as the upstream port, which \ncan be changed dynamically. Figure 1 \nshows some of the  \nPEX 8714 ’s common port configur ations \nin legacy Single -Host mode.  \n \n \n\n \n \nPEX8714 , PCI Express Gen3 Switch, 12 Lanes, 5 Ports  \n \n© PLX Technology, www.plxtech.com  Page 2 of 4  10Sep12; v1.0  The PEX 8714  also provides several ways to configure \nits registers. The device can be configured through \nstrapping pins, I2C interface , host software, or an \noptional serial EEPROM. This allows for easy debug \nduring the development phase, performance monitoring \nduring the operation phase, and driver or software \nupgrade.   \n \nDual -Host & Failover Support  \nIn Single -Host mode, the PEX 8714  supports a Non-\nTransparent (NT) Port,  which enables the \nimplementation of dual-host systems  for redundancy \nand host failover \ncapab ility. The NT \nport allows systems to \nisolate host memory \ndomains by presenting \nthe processor \nsubsystem as an \nendpoint rather than \nanother memory \nsystem. Base address \nregisters are used to \ntranslate addresses; doorbell  registers are used to send \ninterrupts betwe en the address domains; and scratchpad \nregisters (accessible by both CPUs) allow inter -\nprocessor communication  (see Figure 3 ).  \n \nHot-Plug for High Availability  \nHot plug capability allows users to replace hardware \nmodules and perform maintenance without pow ering \ndown the system. The PEX 8714  Hot-Plug capability \nfeature makes it suitable for High Availability (HA) \napplications . One downstream ports include a Standard \nHot Plug Controller. If the PEX 8714  is used in an \napplication where one or more of its downstream ports \nconnect to PCI Express slots, each port’s Hot -Plug \nController can be used to manage the Hot-Plug event of \nits associated slot. Every port on the PEX 8714  is \nequipped with a Hot-Plug contro l/status register to \nsupport Hot-Plug capability through external logic via \nthe I2C interface.  \n \nSerDes Power and Signal Management  \nThe PEX 8714  supports software control of the SerDes \noutputs to allow optimization of power and signal \nstrength in a system. T he PLX SerDes implementation \nsupports four levels of power – off, low, typical, and \nhigh. The SerDes block also supports loop-back modes  and advanced reporting of error conditions , which \nenables efficient management of the entire system.  \n \nInteroperability  \nThe PEX 8714  is designed to be fully compliant with the \nPCI Express Base Specification r3.0, and is backwards \ncompatible to PCI Express Base Specification r1.1 and \nr1.0a. Additionally, it supports auto -negotiation , lane \nreversal , and polarity reversal . Furthermore, the \nPEX 8714  is tested for  Microsoft  Windows Logo  \ncompliance. All PLX switches undergo thorough \ninteroperability testing in PLX’s Interoperability Lab  \nand compliance testing at the PCI -SIG plug -fest.  \n  \n\n \n \nPEX8714 , PCI Express Gen3 Switch, 12 Lanes, 5 Ports  \n \n© PLX Technology, www.plxtech.com  Page 3 of 4  10Sep12; v1.0  performance PAKTM \nExclusive to PLX, performance PAK is a suite of unique \nand innovative performance features which allows \nPLX’s Gen 3  switches to be the highest performing Gen \n3 switches in the market today. The performance PAK \nfeatures consists of Multic ast, and Dynamic Buffer Pool.  \n \nSSC Isol ation  \nThe PEX 8714  employs a multi -clock domain which \nallows the user to terminate Spread Spectrum Clock \nenabled domains.  Terminating the SSC clock removes \nthe need to pass a common clock across a backplane .   \nThe PEX 8714  supports SSC isolation on four of its \nports.  \nvision PAKTM \nAnother PLX exclusive, vision PAK is a deb ug \ndiagnostics suite of integrated hardware and software \ninstruments  that users can use to help bring their systems \nto market faster. vision PAK features consist of \nPerformance Monitoring, SerDes Eye Capture, Error \nInjection, SerDes Loopback, and more.  \n \nPerformance Monitoring  \nThe PEX 8714 ’s real time performance monitoring \nallows users to literally “see” ingress and egress \nperformance on each p ort as traffic passes through the \nswitch using PLX’s Software Development Kit (SDK). \nThe monitoring is completely passive and therefore has \nno affect on overall system performance. Internal \ncounters provide extensive granularity down to traffic & \npacket ty pe and even allows for the filtering of traffic \n(i.e. count only Memory Writes).  \n \nSerDes Eye Capture  \nUsers can evaluate their system’s signal integrity at the \nphysical layer using the PEX 8714 ’s SerDes Eye Capture \nfeature. Using PLX’s SDK, users can view the receiver \neye of any lane on the switch. Users can then modify \nSerDes settings and see the impact on the receiver eye. \nFigure 5 shows a screenshot of the SerDes Eye Capture \nfeature in the SDK.   \nFigure 3. SerDes Eye Capture  \n \nError Injection & SerDes Loo pback  \nUsing the PEX 8714 ’s Error Injection feature, users can \ninject malformed packets and/or fatal errors into their \nsystem and  evaluate a system’s ability to detec t and \nrecover from such errors. The PEX 8714  also supports \nInternal Tx, External Tx, Recovere d Clock, and \nRecovered Data Loopback modes.  \nApplications  \nSuitable for host-centric  as well as peer -to-peer traffic \npatterns,  the PEX 8714  can be configured for a wide \nvariety of form factors and applications.  \nHost Failover  \nThe PEX 8714  can also be utilized in application s where \nhost failover is required. In th e below  application  \n(Figure 8), two host s may be active simultaneously and \ncontrolling their own domains while  exchange status \ninformation through doorbell registers or I2C interface . \nThe devices can be programmed to trigger fail -over if \nthe heartbeat information is not provided. In the event of \na failure,  the surviving device will reset the endpoint s \nconnected to the failing CPU and enumerate them in its \nown domain without impacting the operation of \nendpoints already in its domain.  \n \nFigure 4.

It is through the \nupstream port that the BIOS or host can configure the \nother ports using standard PCI en umeration. The virtual \nPCI to PCI bridges within the PEX 8714  are compliant to \nthe PCI and PCI Express system models. The \nConfiguration Space Registers (CSRs) in a virtual \nprimary/secondary PCI to PCI bridge are accessible by \ntype 0 configuration cycles thr ough the virtual primary \nbus interface (matching bus number, device number, and \nfunction number).  \n \nInterrupt Sources/Events  \nThe PEX 8714  switch supports the INTx interrupt \nmessage type (compatible with PCI 2.3 Interrupt signals) \nor Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) when enabled. \nInterrupts/messages are generated by PEX 8714  for hot \nplug events, doorbell interrupts, baseline error reporting,  \nand advanced error reporting.  \n \nDevelopment Tools  \nPLX offers hardware and software tools to enable rapid \ncustomer design activity.
