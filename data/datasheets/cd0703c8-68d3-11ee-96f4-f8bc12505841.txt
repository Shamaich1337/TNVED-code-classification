It is Atheros’ 4th generation, \nsingle port 10/100/1000 Mbps Tri-speed \nEthernet PHY. It supports RGMII interface to \nthe MAC.™\nThe AR8035 provides a low power, low BOM \n(Bill of Materials) cost solution for \ncomprehensive applications including \nconsumer, enterprise, carrier and home \nnetworks such as PC, HDTV , Gaming \nmachines, Blue-ray players, IPTV STB, Mdia \nPlayers, IP Cameras, NAS, Printers, Digital \nPhoto Frames, MoCA/Homeplug (Powerline)/EoC/ adapters and Home Router \n& Gateways, etc.\nThe AR8035 integrates Atheros latest Green \nEthos® power saving technologies and \nsignificantly saves power not only during work \ntime, but also during overtime. Atheros Green \nEthos® power savings include ultra-low power \nin cable unplugged mode or port power down \nmode, and automatic optimized power saving \nbased on cable length. Furthermore, the \nAR8035 supports Wake-on-LAN (WoL) feature \nto be able to help manage and regulate total \nsystem power requirements.\nThe AR8035 embeds CDT (Cable Diagnostics \nTest) technology on-chip which allows \ncustomers to measure cable length, detect the \ncable status, and identify remote and local PHY \nmalfunctions, bad or marginal patch cord \nsegments or connectors. Some of the possible \nproblems that can be detected include opens, \nshorts, cable impedance mismatch, bad \nconnectors, termination mismatch, and a bad \ntransformer.\nThe AR8035 also integrates a voltage regulator \non chip. It reduces the termination R/C \ncircuitry on both the MAC interface (RGMII) \nand line side.\nThe AR8035 supports IEEE 802.3az Energy \nEfficient Ethernet (EEE) standard and Atheros \nproprietary SmartEEE, which allows legacy \nMAC/SoC devices without 802.3az support to function as the comple te 802.3az system.

It \nis a highly integrated analog front end (AFE) \nand digital signal transceiver, providing high \nperformance combined with substantial cost \nreduction. The AR8035 provides physical layer \nfunctions for half/full -duplex 10 BASE-Te, 100 \nBASE-Tx and 1000 BASE-T Ethernet to transmit \nand receive high-speed data over standard \ncategory 5 (CAT5) unshielded twisted pair \ncable. \nThe AR8035 10/100/1000 PHY is fully 802.3ab \ncompliant, and supports the reduced Gigabit Media-Independent Interface (RGMII) to \nconnect to a Gigabit-capable MAC.\nThe AR8035 transceiver combines echo \ncanceller, near end cross talk (NEXT) canceller, \nfeed-forward equalizer, joint Viterbi, feedback \nequalizer, and timing recovery, to enhance \nsignal performance in noisy environments.\nThe AR8035 is a part of the Arctic family of \ndevices — which includes the AR8031, the \nAR8033, and the AR8035. A comparison of \nthese is shown below.\nTable 2-1  shows a feature comparison across the AR8031, AR8033, and AR8035 family.\nNOTE: AR8031, AR8033 is pin-to-pin compatible\nNOTE: ** 10BASE-Te, 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T will be supported\nNOTE: *** 100BASE-FX, and 1000BASE-X will be supportedTable 2-1.

A signal reflects \nback as an echo if the transmitter is not \nperfectly matched to the line. Other connector \nor cable imperfections,  such as patch panel \ndiscontinuity and variations in cable \nimpedance along the twisted pair cable, also result in drastic SNR degradation on the \nreceive signal. The AR8035 device implements \na digital echo canceller to  adjust for echo and is \nadaptive to compensate for the varied channel \nconditions.\n2.2.4 NEXT Canceller\nThe 1000 BASE-T physical layer uses all four \npairs of wires to transmit data. Because the four \ntwisted pairs are bundled together, significant \nhigh frequency crosstalk occurs between \nadjacent pairs in the bundle. The AR8035 \ndevice uses three parallel NEXT cancellers on \neach receive channel to cancel high frequency \ncrosstalk. The AR8035 cancels NEXT by \nsubtracting an estimate of these signals from \nthe equalizer output.\n2.2.5 Baseline Wander Canceller\nBaseline wander results from Ethernet links \nthat AC-couple to the transceivers and from AC coupling that cannot maintain voltage \nlevels for longer than a short time. As a result, \ntransmitted pulses are di storted, resulting in \nerroneous sampled values for affected pulses. \nBaseline wander is more problematic in the \n1000 BASE-T environment than in 100 BASE-\nTX due to the DC baseline shift in the transmit \nand receive signals. The AR8035 device uses an \nadvanced baseline wander cancellation circuit \nthat continuously monitors and compensates \nfor this effect, minimizi ng the impact of DC \nbaseline shift on the overall error rate.\n2.2.6 Digital Adaptive Equalizer\nThe digital adaptive equalizer removes inter-\nsymbol interference at the receiver. The digital \nadaptive equalizer takes unequalized signals \nfrom ADC output and uses a combination of \nfeedforward equalizer (FFE) and decision Table 2-2.  Transmit Encoder Modes\nEncoder Mode Description\n1000 BASE-T In 1000 BASE-T mode, the AR8035 \nscrambles transmit data bytes \nfrom the MAC interfaces to 9-bit symbols and encodes them into \n4D five-level PAM signals over the \nfour pairs of CAT5 cable.\n100 BASE-TX In 100 BASE-TX mode, 4-bit data \nfrom the MII is 4B/5B serialized, \nscrambled, and encoded to a three-level MLT3 sequence \ntransmitted by the PMA.\n10 BASE-Te In 10 BASE-Te mode, the AR8035 \ntransmits and receives \nManchester-encoded data.\nTable 2-3.  Receive Decoder Modes\nDecoder Mode Description\n1000 BASE-T In 1000 BASE-T mode, the PMA \nrecovers the 4D PAM signals after accounting for the cabling \nconditions such as skew among \nthe four pairs, the pair swap order, and the polarity of the pairs. The \nresulting code group is decoded \ninto 8-bit data values. Data stream delimiters are translated \nappropriately and data is output \nto the MAC interfaces. \n100 BASE-TX In 100 BASE-TX mode, the receive \ndata stream is recovered and \ndescrambled to align to the symbol boundaries. The aligned \ndata is then parallelized and 5B/\n4B decoded to 4-bit data. This output runs to the MII receive \ndata pins after data stream \ndelimiters have been translated. \n10 BASE-Te In 10 BASE-Te mode, the \nrecovered 10 BASE-Te signal is \ndecoded from Manchester then aligned. \nAtheros Communications, Inc.

Auto-\nnegotiation provides a mechanism for \ntransferring information between a pair of link \npartners to choose the best possible mode of \noperation in terms of speed, duplex modes, \nand master/slave preference. Auto-negotiation \nis initiated upon any of the following scenarios:\nnPower-up reset\nnHardware reset\nnSoftware reset\nnAuto-negotiation restart\nnTransition from power-down to power-up\nnThe link goes down\nIf auto-negotiation is disabled, a 10 BASE-Te or \n100 BASE-TX can be manually selected using \nthe IEEE MII registers. \n2.2.8 Smartspeed Function\nThe Atheros Smartspeed function is an \nenhanced feature of auto-negotiation that \nallows the AR8035 device to fall back in speed \nbased on cabling conditions as well as operate \nover CAT3 cabling (i n 10 BASE-T mode) or \ntwo-pair CAT5 cabling (in 100 BASE-TX mode). \nBy default, the Smartspeed feature is enabled. \nRefer to the register “Smart Speed”  on page 43 , \nwhich describes how to set the parameters. Set \nthese register bits to control the Smartspeed \nfeature:\nnBit [5]: 1 = Enables Smartspeed (default)\nnBits [4:2]: Sets the number of link attempts \nbefore adjusting\nnBit [1]: Timer to determine the stable link condition\n2.2.9 Automatic MDI/MDIX Crossover\nDuring auto-negotiation, the AR8035 device \nautomatically determines and sets the required \nMDI configuration, eliminating the need for \nexternal crossover cable. If the remote device \nalso implements automatic MDI crossover, the \ncrossover algorithm as described in IEEE 802.3 \nclause 40.4.4 ensures that only one device \nperforms the required crossover.\n2.2.10 Polarity Correction\nIf cabling has been incorrectly wired, the AR8035 automatically corrects polarity errors on the receive pairs in 1000 BASE-T, 100 BASE-\nTX and 10 BASE-Te modes.\n2.3 Loopback Modes\n2.3.1 Digital Loopback\nDigital loopback provides the ability to loop transmitted data back to the receiver using \ndigital circuitry in the AR8035 device. Figure 2-\n1 shows a block diagram of a digital loopback.\nn1000M loopback: write register 0x0 = 0x4140 \nto enable 1000M digital loopback.\nn100M loopback: write register 0x0 = 0x6100 to enable 100M digital loopback.\nn10M loopback: write register 0x0 = 0x4100 to enable 10M digital loopback.\n2.3.2 External Cable Loopback\nExternal cable loopback loops Tx to Rx through \na complete digital and analog path and an \nexternal cable, thus test ing all the digital data \npaths and all the analog circuits. Figure 2-2  \nshows a block diagram of external cable \nloopback. \n1. Plug in an external loopback cable (1-3/2-6/\n4-7/5-8)\n2. Write debug register 0xB[15] = 0 to disable \nhibernate (power-saving mode)\n3. Write debug register 0x11[0] = 1 to enable \nexternal loopback\n4. Select wire speed, as follows:Figure 2-1.

When the cable in 1000M mode is re-\nplugged, need to write 0x0 = 0x8140 again \nto make the PHY link.\n2.3.3 Remote PHY Loopback\nThe Remote loopback connects the MDI receive path to the MDI transmit path, near the RGMII \ninterface, thus the remote link partner can \ndetect the connectivity in the resulting loop. \nFigure 2-3, below, shows the path of the remote \nloopback.\nFigure 2-3  shows a block diagram of external \ncable loopback. \nnWrite MMD3 register 0x805A[0]= 1 to \nenable remote PHY loopback.\nPlease note : The packets from link partner will \nstill appear at RGMII interface when remote \nloopback is enabled.\nAlso, remote loopback is independant of PHY \nauto-negotiation.\n2.4 Cable Diagnostic Test\nThe Cable Diagnostic Test (CDT) feature in the AR8035 device uses Time Domain \nReflectometry (TDR) to identify remote and \nlocal PHY malfunctions, bad/marginal cable or \npatch cord segments, or connectors. Some of \nthe possible problems that can be diagnosed \ninclude opens, shorts, cable impedance \nmismatch, bad connectors, termination \nmismatch, and bad magnetics. The CDT can be \nperformed when there is no link partner or \nwhen the link partner is auto-negotiating.\n1. Set register 0x16[9:8] to select MDI pair \nunder test2. Write register 0x16[0]=1 to enable CDT\n3. Check register 0x1C[9:8] for fail status4. Check register 0x1C[7 :0] to get delta time. \nThe distance between the fail point and \nPHY is delta time *0.842\n2.5 LED Interface\nThe LED interface can either be controlled by \nthe PHY or controlled manually, independent \nof the state of the PHY. Three status LEDs are \navailable. These can be used to indicate \noperation speed, duplex mode, and link status. \nThe LEDs can be programmed to different \nstatus functions from their default value. They \ncan also be controlled directly from the MII \nregister interface. \nThe reference design schematics for the \nAR8035’s LEDs are shown\nFigure 2-4  Reference Design Schematic — \nActive Low\nFigure 2-5  Reference Design Schematic — \nActive High \nLED_ACT/LED_1000 active states depend on \npower on strapping mode.Figure 2-3.

(It is optional for an external \nregulator to provide this core voltage). \nThe AR8035 integrates two on chip LDOs \nwhich can support 2.5V; 1.5V/1.8V RGMII I/O voltage. Also with 2.5V RGMII I/O voltage \nconfiguration AR8035 can work with a 3.3V \nMAC RGMII interface — because the input can \nbear 3.3V logic signal, and the output logic \nVoH and VoL can satisfy the 3.3V LVCMOS/\nLVTTL requirement. The parameter details are \nin the Electrical Characteristics chapter.\nReference design for 2.5V RGMII voltage level \nis shown below:\nFigure 2-6 shows the AR8035 reference design for a 2.5V RGMII voltage level.\nReference design for 1. 5/1.8V RGMII voltage \nlevel is shown below:Figure 2-6.

PRE is a sequence of 32 contiguous logic \none bits on MDIO with 32 corresponding \ncycles on MDC to provide the PHY with a \npattern that it can use to establish \nsynchronization.\n2. ST is start of frame3. OP is the operation code. The operation \ncode for a read transaction is <10>, while \nthe operation code for a write transaction is \n<01>.\n4. PHYAD is 5 bits PHY address. PHY address \nof AR8035 is configured by power on \nstrapping. There are three address bits can be configured in AR8035 which means 8 \nPHYs can be connected to the same \nmanagement interface. Each PHY \nconnected to the same bus line should have \na unique PHY address. The first PHY \naddress bit transmitted and received is the \nMSB of the address.\n5. The Register Address is five bits, allowing \n32 individual registers to be addressed \nwithin each PHY. The first Register Address \nbit transmitted and received is the MSB of \nthe address.\n6. TA is 2 bits to avoid contention during a \nread operation. For a read operation, both \nthe MAC and PHY shall remain in a high-\nimpedance state for the first bit time. The \nPHY shall drive a zero during the second bit \ntime of the turnaround. During a write \ntransaction, the MAC must drive 10.\n7. Data is the 16 bits data from accessed \nregister. MSB is transmitted first.\n8. Idle is a high-impedance without driving \nstate of the MDIO. At least one clocked idle \nstate is required between frames. \nThere are three kinds of registers in AR8035. \nAll can be accessed using the management \nframes.\n1. IEEE defined 32 MII registers.2. Atheros defined Debug registers.3. IEEE defined MDIO Manageable Device \n(MMD) register\nMII register can be access directly through the \nframe defined above.\nDebug register access:\n1.

The standard \nIEEE power-down mode is entered by setting \nthe POWER_DOWN bit (bit [11]) of the register \n“Control” equal to one. In this mode, the \nAR8035 ignores all MAC interface signals \nexcept the MDC/MDIO. It does not respond to \nany activity on the CAT 5 cable. The AR8035 \ncannot wake up on its own. It can only wake up by setting the POWER_DOWN bit of the \n“Control” register to 0, or a Hardware Reset \nSee Table 4.1.15  on page 39 .\n2.8.2 Shorter Cable Power Mode\nWith Atheros latest propriatary Green Ethos® \npower saving technology, the AR8035 can \nattain an additional 25% power savings when a \ncable length is detected that is < 30M vs. \nstantard power consumption for a 100M Cat5 \ncable. The equals and additional 100mW power \nsavings and less than 350mW total power for \n1000BASE-T mode in a typical home \napplication.\n2.8.3 Hibernation Mode\nThe AR8035 supports hibernation mode. When \nthe cable is unplugged, the AR8035 will enter \nhibernation mode after about 10 seconds. The \nAtheros Communications, Inc. AR8035 Integrated  10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet Transceiver \x81 17\uf020\nCOMPANY CONFIDENTIAL March 2011  \x81 17power consumption in this mode can go as low \nas 10mW only when compared to the normal \nmode of aperation. When the cable is re-\nconnected, the AR8035 wakes up and normal \nfunctioning is restored.\n2.9 IEEE 802.3az and Energy Efficient \nEthernet\nIEEE 802.3az provides a mechanism to greatly \nsave the power consumption between data \npackets bursts. The link partners enter Low \nPower Idle state by sending short refresh \nsignals to maintain the link.\nThere are two operating states, Active state for \nnormal data transfer, and Low-power state \nbetween the data packet bursts.\nIn the low-power state, PHY shuts off most of \nthe analog and digital blocks to reserve energy. \nDue to the bursty traffic nature of Ethernet, \nsystem will stay in low-power mode in the \nmost of time, thus the power saving can be \nmore than 90%.At the link start up, both link partners \nexchange information via auto neg to \ndetermine if both parties are capable of \nentering LPI mode.\nLegacy Ethernet products are supported, and \nthis is made transparent to the user.\n2.9.1 IEEE 802.3az LPI Mode\nAR8035 works in the following modes when \n802.3 az feature is turned on:\nnActive: the regular mode to transfer data\nnSleep: send special signal to inform remote \nlink of entry into low-power state\nnQuiet: No signal transmitted on media, most of the analog and digital blocks are \nturned off to reduce energy.\nnRefresh: send periodically special training signal to maintain timing recovery and \nequalizer coefficients\nnWake: send special wakup signal to remote link to inform of the entry back into Active.\nFigure 2-9 shows the 802.3az operating states for the AR8035.\nFigure 2-9.

It helps legacy MAC without \nEEE ability to work as a complete EEE power \nsaving system.\nAR8035 SmartEEE will detect egress data flow, \nif there are no packets to transfer after a \ndefined time which are cofigurable based on \nsystem design, it will enter EEE mode. If there are packets need to transfer, AR8035 will wait \ntypically 16.5us to wake  up as 802.3az defined \nand send out datas after the timer \nconfiguration in register. It provides a \n2048*20bit buffer for egress data before waking \nup to ensure no packet loss.\nAR8035 default mode enables smart EEE after \npower on or hardware reset.\nWorking in smartEEE, AR8035 RX side will not \ngenerate MDI LPI pattern. So only normal \npackets and idle packets will appear on the \nRGMII inteface. There is no TX LPI pattern at \nall if MAC has no EEE capability. LPI is \ngenerated inside PHY according to smartEEE \nmechanism. \nIf the MAC has EEE capability, can write \nSmartEEE control register to bypass SmartEEE \nfunction.Please Note :\n1. Wait time before entering EEE mode is in \nregister MMD3 0x805c,0x805d[7:0];\n2. Adjustable wait time before sending out \ndata is in register MMD3 0x805b, To \ncooperate with link partner for special \nrequirement.\n2.11 Wake On LAN (WoL)\nOriginally Wake-on-LAN (WoL) was an Ethernet networking standard that allowed a \ncomputer to be turned on (or woken up) by a \nnetwork message for Admi nstrator attention, \netc. However as part of the latest industry \ntrend towards energy savings, WoL gets wide \ninterest to be adopted across networking \nsystems as a mechanism to help to manage and \nregulate the total power consumed by the \nnetwork. The AR8035 supports Wake-on-LAN \n(WoL):\nnAble to enter the sleep/isolate state (PHY’s \nall TX bus (including clock) are in High-Z \nstate, but PHY can still receive packets) by \nISOLATE bit in MII register configuration\nnConsumes less than 50mW when in sleep/isolate mode\nnSupports automatic detection of magic packets (a specific frame containing anywhere within its payload: 6 bytes of \nones (resulting in hexadecimal FF FF FF FF \nFF FF), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target computer\'s MAC address) and \nnotification via hardware interrupt.\nnSupports exit from the sleep state, by register configurationFigure 2-10.

The 1.1V core and 2.5V , 1.8V/1.5V voltages \nare generated by AR8035\'s internal regulators. So  the AR8035’s power-on sequence to establish the \npower rails stability is met internally.\n3.8.2 Reset and Clock Timing\nThe AR8035 hardware reset needs the clock to take  effect. Input clock including the crystal and \nexternal input clock should be stable for at least 1ms before RESET can be deasserted. For chip \nreliability, an external clock must be input after the power-on sequence.\nFigure 3-3  shows the Reset Timing diagram.\nWhen using crystal, the clock is generated internally after power is stable. For a reliable power on \nreset, suggest to keep asserting the reset low long enough (10ms) to ensure the clock is stable and \nclock-to-reset 1ms requirement is satisfied.Figure 3-3.

Reset Types  \nType Description\nLH Register field with la tching high function. \nIf status is high, then the register is set to \none and remains set until a read operation \nis performed through the management interface or a reset occurs.\nLL Register field with latching low function. If \nstatus is low, then the register is cleared to \na zero and remains cleared until a read operation is performed through the \nmanagement interface or a reset occurs.Retain Value written to a register field takes effect \nwithout a software reset.\nSC Self-Clear. Writing a one to this register \ncauses the desired function to execute \nimmediately, and the register field clears \nto zero when the function is complete.\nUpdate The value written to the register field does \nnot take effect until a software reset is \nexecuted. The value can still be read after \nit is written.Table 4-1.  Reset Types  (continued)\nType Description\nTable 4-2.
