  - Reverse Voltage (VR): 30 V
  - Reverse Breakdown Voltage (V(BR)R): 30 V (min)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Forward Current (DC, IF): 200 mA (max)
  - Non-Repetitive Peak Forward Current (IFSM): 600 mA (max, tp < 10 msec)
  - Repetitive Peak Forward Current (IFRM): 300 mA (max, pulse wave = 1 sec, duty cycle = 66%)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Forward Power Dissipation: 225 mW at TA = 25 °C, derating at 1.8 mW/°C above 25 °C

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Junction Temperature (TJ): -55 °C to +150 °C
  - Storage Temperature Range (Tstg): -55 °C to +150 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - SOT-23 (TO-236)

- **Special Features:**
  - Extremely fast switching speed
  - Low forward voltage drop (0.35 V typ @ IF = 10 mA)
  - AEC-Q101 qualified for automotive applications
  - Pb-Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free, and RoHS compliant

- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - MSL Level 1 (JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The BAT54CLT1G is commonly used in:
- High-speed switching applications
- Circuit protection (e.g., clamping)
- Voltage clamping in various electronic circuits
- Automotive applications requiring robust performance under varying conditions
- Hand-held and portable devices where space is limited
