Pin Description\nSerial Clock (SCL): The SCL input is used to positive edge clock data into each EEPROM device and negative \nedge clock data out of each device.\nSerial Data (SDA):  The SDA pin is bidirectional for serial data transfer. This pin is open drain driven and may be \nwire-ORed with any number of other open drain or open collector devices.\nDevice Addresses (A2 and A1): The A2 and A1 pins are device address inputs that can be hardwired or left not \nconnected for hardware compatibility with other Atmel AT24Cxx devices. When the A2 and A1 pins are \nhardwired, as many as four 1-Mbit devices may be addressed on a single bus system (See “Device Addressing” on page 9. for more details). If the A\n2 and A1 pins are left floating, the A2 and A1 pin will be internally pulled down \nto GND if the capacitive coupling to the circuit board VCC plane is <3pF. If coupling is >3pF, Atmel recommends \nconnecting the A2 and A1 pin to GND.\nWrite Protect (WP):  The Write Protect input, when connected to GND, allows normal write operations. When \nWP is connected high to VCC, all write operations to the memory are inhibited. If the pin is left floating, the WP \npin will be internally pulled down to GND if the capacitive coupling to the circuit board VCC plane is <3pF. If \ncoupling is >3pF, Atmel recommends connecting the pin to GND. Switching WP to VCC prior to a write operation \ncreates a software write protect function.\nTable 4-1.

Device Operation\nClock and Data Transitions:  The SDA pin is normally pulled high with an external device. Data on the SDA pin \nmay change only during SCL low time periods. Data changes during SCL high periods will indicate a Start or Stop condition as defined below.\nFigure 6-1.

Device Addressing\nThe 1-Mbit EEPROM requires an 8-bit device address word following a Start condition to enable the chip for a \nread or write operation (see Figure 7-1  below). The device address word consists of a mandatory ‘1010’  \nsequence for the first four most significant bits. This is common to all 2-wire EEPROM devices.\nThe 1-Mbit uses the two device address bits, A2 and A1, to allow up to four devices on the same bus. These A2 \nand A1 bits must compare to the corresponding hardwired input pins, A2 and A1. The A2 and A1 pins uses an \ninternal proprietary circuit that biases it to a logic low condition if the pin is allowed to float.\nThe seventh bit (P0) of the device address is a memory page address bit. This memory page address bit is the \nmost significant bit of the data word address that follows. The eighth bit of the device address is the read/write operation select bit. A read operation is initiated if this bit is high and a write operation is initiated if this bit is low.\nUpon a compare of the device address, the EEPROM will output a zero. If a valid compare is not made, the \ndevice will return to a standby state.\nFigure 7-1. Device Address\n8. Write Operations\nByte Write:  To select a data word in the 1-Mbit memory requires a 17-bit word address. The word address field \nconsists of the P0 bit in the device address byte, then the most significant word address followed by the least \nsignificant word address ( Figure 8-1 ).\nA write operation requires the P0 bit and two 8-bit data word addresses following the device address word and \nacknowledgment. Upon receipt of this address, the EEPROM will again respond with a zero and then the part is to receive the first 8-bit data word. Following receipt of the 8-bit data word, the EEPROM will output a zero. The addressing device, such as a microcontroller, then must terminate the write sequence with a Stop condition. At this time the EEPROM enters an internally timed write cycle, t\nWR, to the nonvolatile memory. All inputs are \ndisabled during this write cycle and the EEPROM will not respond until the write is complete ( Figure 8-1 ).\nFigure 8-1.

Instead, after the EEPROM acknowledges receipt of the first data word, the microcontroller can transmit up to 255 more data words. The EEPROM will respond with an acknowledge after each data word is received. The microcontroller must terminate the page write sequence with a Stop condition ( Figure 8-2 ) and the internally timed write cycle will begin.\nThe data word address lower 8 bits are internally incremented following the receipt of each data word. The \nhigher data word address bits are not incremented, retaining the memory page row location. When the internally generated word address, reaches the page boundary, the following byte is placed at the beginning of the same page. If more than 256 data words are transmitted to the EEPROM, the data word address will “roll over” and previous data will be overwritten. The address “rollover” during write is from the last byte of the current page to the first byte of the same page.\nFigure 8-2. Page Write\nAcknowledge Polling:  Once the internally timed write cycle has started and the EEPROM inputs are disabled, \nAcknowledge Polling can be initiated. This involves sending a Start condition followed by the device address word. The read/write bit is representative of the operation desired. Only if the internal write cycle has completed will the EEPROM respond with a zero, allowing a new read or write sequence to be initiated.\nData Security:  The AT24CM01 has a hardware data protection scheme that allows the user to write protect the \nentire memory when the WP pin is at V\nCC.SDA LINES\nT\nO\nPS\nT\nA\nR\nTW\nR\nI\nT\nEDevice\nAddressFirst Word\n AddressSecond Word \nAddress Data (n) Data (n + x)\nM\nSBA\nC\nKP\n0A\nC\nKL\nSBL\nSBA\nC\nKA\nC\nKA\nC\nKR\n/\nW\n 11 AT24CM01 [DATASHEET]\nAtmel-8812F-SEEPROM-AT24CM01-Datasheet_0120159. Read Operations\nRead operations are initiated the same way as write operations with the exception that the read/write select bit \nin the device address word is set to one. There are three read operations: Current Address Read, Random Address Read, and Sequential Read.\nCurrent Address Read:  The internal data word address counter maintains the last address accessed during \nthe last read or write operation, incremented by one. This address stays valid between operations as long as the V\nCC to the part is maintained. The address “rollover” during read is from the last byte of the last page, to the first \nbyte of the first page of the memory.\nOnce the device address with the read/write select bit set to one is input and acknowledged by the EEPROM, \nthe current address data word is serially clocked out on the SDA line. The microcontroller does not respond with a zero but does generate a following Stop condition.\nFigure 9-1. Current Address Read\nRandom Read:  A Random Read requires an initial byte write sequence to load in the data word address. This \nis known as a “dummy write” operation. Once the device address word and data word address are clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, the microcontroller must generate another Start condition. The microcontroller now initiates a current address read by sending a device address with the read/write select bit high. The EEPROM acknowledges the device address and serially clocks out the data word on the SDA line. The microcontroller does not respond with a zero but does generate a following Stop condition.\nFigure 9-2.

After \nthe microcontroller receives a data word, it responds with an acknowledge. As long as the EEPROM receives an acknowledge, it will continue to increment the data word address and serially clock out sequential data words. When the memory address limit is reached, the data word address will “roll over” and the sequential read will continue. The Sequential Read operation is terminated when the microcontroller does not respond with a zero, but does generate a following Stop condition.\nFigure 9-3.
