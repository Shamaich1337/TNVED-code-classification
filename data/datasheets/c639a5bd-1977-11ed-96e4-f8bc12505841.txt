A PMOS FET protects the systems\n(i.e.: VBUS) connected on the V out pin, against positive\novervoltage. The Output follows the VBUS level untilOVLO threshold is overtaken.\nUndervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nTo ensure proper operation under any conditions, the\ndevice has a built −in undervoltage lock out (UVLO)\ncircuit. During V in positive going slope, the output remains\ndisconnected from input until V in voltage is above 3.0 V\nnominal. The FLAGV  output is pulled to low as long as V in\ndoes not reach UVLO threshold. This circuit has a 70 mV\nhysteresis to provide noise immunity to transient condition.\nFigure 20.

During overvoltage condition (OVLOexceeds), the output remains disabled and FLAG\n is tied\nlow, as long as the input voltage is higher than OVLO −\nhysteresis. This circuit has a 100 mV hysteresis to provide\nnoise immunity to transient conditions .\nOvercurrent Protection (OCP)\nThe NCP361 integrates overcurrent protection to\nprevent system/battery overload or defect. The currentlimit threshold is internally set at 750 mA. This value canbe changed from 150 mA to 750 mA by a metal tweak,please contact your ON Semiconductor representative for\navailability. During current fault, the internal PMOS FET\nis automatically turned off (5 /C0109s) if the charge current\nexceeds I\nlim. NCP361 goes into turn on and turn off mode\nas long as defect is present. The internal ton delay (4 mstypical) allows limiting thermal dissipation. The Flag pin\ngoes to low level when an overcurrent fault appears. That\nallows the microcontroller to count defect events and turnsoff the PMOS with EN pin.Figure 21. Overcurrent Event ExampleIlim\ntonVout\nIloadOverload Retrieve\nnormal\noperation\nFLAG  Output\nNCP361 provides a FLAG  output, which alerts external\nsystems that a fault has occurred.\nThis pin is tied to low as soon as: 1.2 V < V in < UVLO,\nVin > OVLO, I charge  > I limit, TJ > 150 °C. When NCP361\nrecovers normal condition, FLAG  is held high. The pin is\nan open drain output, thus a pull up resistor (typically 1 M /C0087\n− Minimum 10 k /C0087) must be provided to V CC. FLAG  pin is\nan open drain output.\nEN Input\nTo enable normal operation, the EN  pin shall be forced\nto low or connected to ground. A high level on the pindisconnects OUT pin from IN pin. EN\n does not overdrive\nan OVLO or UVLO fault.\nInternal PMOS FET\nThe NCP361 includes an internal PMOS FET to protect\nthe systems, connected on OUT pin, from positive\novervoltage. Regarding electrical characteristics, the\nRDS(on) , during normal operation, will create low losses on\nVout pin, characterized by V in versus V out dropout.\nESD Tests\nThe NCP361 fully supports the IEC61000 −4−2, level 4\n(Input pin, 1 /C0109F mounted on board). That means, in Air\ncondition, V in has a ±15 kV ESD protected input. In\nContact condition, V in has ±8 kV ESD protected input.\nPlease refer to Figure 22 to see the IEC61000 −4−2\nelectrostatic discharge waveform.\nNCP361, NCV361\nwww. onsemi.com\n9\nFigure 22. \nPCB Recommendations\nThe NCP361 integrates a 500 mA rated PMOS FET, and\nthe PCB rules must be respected to properly evacuate the\nheat out of the silicon. The UDFN P AD1 must be connected\nto ground plane to increase the heat transfer if necessaryfrom an application standpoint. Of course, in any case, this\npad shall be not connected to any other potential.\nBy increasing PCB area, the R /C0113JA of the package can be\ndecreased, allowing higher charge current to fill the battery.\nTaking into account that internal bondings (wires\nbetween package and silicon) can handle up to 1 A (higher\nthan thermal capability), the following calculation shows\ntwo different example of current capability, depending on\nPCB area:\n•With 305 °C/W (without PCB area), allowing DC\ncurrent is 500 mA\n•With 260 °C/W (200 mm2), the charge DC current\nallows with a  85 °C ambient temperature is:\nI = √(TJ-TA)/(R/C0113JA x R DSON )\nI = 625 mAIn every case, we recommend to make thermal\nmeasurement on final application board to make sure of the\nfinal Thermal Resistance.\n80130180230280330380\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\nCopper heat spreader area (mm^2)Theta JA (C/W)\n0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%\n% Delta DFN vs TSOP −5TSOP−5 1.0 oz\nTSOP−5 2.0 oz\nDFN 2x2.2 1.0 oz\nDFN 2x2.2 2.0 oz\n% Delta DFN vs TSOP −5\nFigure 23.

### Description of the Component:

The **NCP361SNT1G** is a USB positive overvoltage protection controller designed to safeguard electronic systems from overvoltage conditions. It features an integrated PMOS FET, which eliminates the need for external components, thereby reducing system costs and PCB area. The device disconnects the output from the input when the input voltage exceeds the overvoltage threshold, providing robust protection for connected devices.

### Typical Applications:

The NCP361 is commonly used in various applications, including:

- **USB Devices:** Protects USB ports and devices from voltage spikes.
- **Mobile Phones:** Ensures safe operation by preventing overvoltage conditions.
- **Peripheral Devices:** Safeguards peripherals connected to computers or other systems.
- **Personal Digital Applications:** Protects devices like MP3 players and digital cameras.
- **Set-Top Boxes:** Provides overvoltage protection for consumer electronics.

This component is particularly valuable in applications where reliability and protection against voltage transients are critical, making it suitable for consumer electronics, automotive applications, and other sensitive electronic systems.
