#### Component Description:
The B88069X4640C102 is a **surge arrester**, specifically a **2-electrode arrester** from the M51-A350X series by EPCOS. Its primary function is to protect electrical circuits from voltage spikes caused by lightning strikes or switching surges. The device operates by diverting excess voltage away from sensitive components, thereby preventing damage.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Branch Exchange:** Protects telecommunications equipment from voltage surges.
- **Line Protection:** Safeguards electrical lines from transient overvoltages.
- **Subscriber Protection:** Ensures the safety of subscriber lines in telecommunication systems.
- **Alarm Systems:** Protects alarm systems from voltage spikes that could cause malfunction or damage.

This surge arrester is designed for applications where high reliability and fast response to voltage transients are critical, making it suitable for various electronic and telecommunication systems.
