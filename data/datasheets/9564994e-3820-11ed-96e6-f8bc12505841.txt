### Component Summary: LFCN-8400+

**Description:**
The LFCN-8400+ is a ceramic low pass filter designed for RF applications. It operates effectively from DC to 8400 MHz, providing excellent performance in filtering out high-frequency noise while allowing lower frequencies to pass through. This component is particularly useful in applications requiring harmonic rejection and is suitable for VHF/UHF transmitters and receivers.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:** Not specified; however, it is noted that coupling capacitors are required if DC voltage is present at either input or output ports.
- **Current Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; the RF power input is rated at a maximum of 38 W at 25°C.
- **Power Consumption:** Maximum RF power input of 38 W.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206-4 (small size, hermetically sealed).
- **Special Features:**
  - Excellent power handling capability (up to 8 W).
  - Temperature stable performance.
  - LTCC (Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic) construction.
  - Protected by U.S. Patent 6,943,646.
  - RoHS compliant.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data.

**Typical Applications:**
The LFCN-8400+ is commonly used in:
- Harmonic rejection circuits.
- VHF/UHF transmitters and receivers.
- Laboratory equipment for RF testing and signal processing.

This low pass filter is ideal for applications where maintaining signal integrity at lower frequencies while attenuating unwanted high-frequency signals is critical. Its robust design and high power handling make it suitable for demanding RF environments.
