This controller is ideal \nfor embedded applications such as industrial automation, in-vehicle \ninfotainment, medical, print imaging, telecommunications infrastruc -\nture, and for military.\nThe I210 supports advanced features such as Audio-Video Bridging \n(AVB), IEEE 802.1AS precision timestamping, Error Correcting Code \n(ECC) Packet Buffers, and Enhanced Management Interface options.\nThe fully integrated GbE MAC/PHY capabilities can be configured \nfor either 1000 Mb/s or 10/100 Mb/s modes of operation. The I210 \nenables a quick migration from custom interconnects to Ethernet.\n\nPerformance Optimization Capabilities\nThe Intel® Ethernet Controller I210 contains four  \ntransmit and four receive queues for the single port. \nThese queues offer Error Correcting Memory (ECC) \nprotection for improved data reliability. The controller \nefficiently manages packets with minimum latency by \ncombining parallel and pipelined logic architectures \noptimized for these independent transmit and  \nreceive queues.\nThese queues, combined with Receive Side Scaling \n(RSS) and Message Signal Interrupt Extension (MSI-X) \nsupport, provide a toolset for optimizing the  \nperformance on multi-core processor designs.\nAdvanced interrupt-handling features to manage  \nmultiple interrupts simultaneously, combined with  \nintelligent filtering, ordering, and directing of packets \nto specific queues and cores, enables load-balancing \nthe network traffic flows to improve throughput in  \nMulti-core platforms.\nOther performance-enhancing features include IPv4 \nand IPv6 checksum offload, TCP/UDP checksum \noffload, extended Tx descriptors for more offload \ncapabilities, up to 256 KB TCP segmentation (TSO v2), \nheader splitting, 40 KB packet buffer size, and 9.5 KB \nJumbo Frame support. \nAdvanced Features\nAudio-Video Bridging (AVB)\nSupports IEEE 802.1Qav Audio-Video Bridging (AVB) for \ncustomers that require tightly controlled media stream  \nsynchronization, buffering, and reservation. The \n802.1Qav is part of the AVB specification that provides \na way to guarantee bounded latency and latency  \nvariation for time-sensitive traffic and includes:\n• Timing and Synchronization for time-specific  \napplications (802.1AS)\n• Stream Reservation (SR) protocol to guarantee the  \nresources needed for Audio/Video (AV)  \nstreams (802.1Qat)\n• Forwarding and queueing enhancements for  \ntime-sensitive streams (802.1Qav)\nIEEE 1588/802.1AS Timestamping\nSupports IEEE 1588/802.1AS for precision  \ntimestamping of packets. IEEE 1588 provides a  \nmechanism for clock synchronization requirements \nof measurement and control systems. The protocol \nsupports system-wide synchronization accuracy in the \nsubmicrosecond range with minimal network and local \nclock computing resources. The protocol is spatially \nlocalized and allows simple systems to be installed and \noperate. The IEEE 802.1AS standard specifies the pro -\ntocol used to ensure that synchronization  requirements are met for time-sensitive applications, \nsuch as audio and video, across bridged and Virtual \nBridged Local Area Networks (VBLAN) consisting of LAN \nmedia where the transmission delays are essentially \nfixed and symmetrical.\nFlexible Filters\nSupports a total of eight individually configurable  \nflexible filters. Filters can be used for wake-up or  \nproxying when in D3 state or for queueing when in  \nD0 state.\nSecure Flexible Firmware Architecture\nFlexible Firmware Architecture with Secure NVM  \nUpdate protects the flash from external unauthorized\nsoftware programming. The I210-AT/IT/AS/IS  \nimplement a signed firmware authentication capability \nto verify the firmware and critical device settings with \nbuilt-in corruption detection. The Intel® Ethernet  \nController I210-AT/IT/AS/IS also supports dynamic \nfirmware updating that enables firmware updates  \nwithout the need for a system reboot. For  \nI210-CL/CS an immutable firmware code is built into \nthe ROM that eliminates firmware tampering or  \nfirmware replacement.\nSoftware Definable Pins\nFour Software Definable Pins (SDPs) enable additional \ndesign customization for embedded platforms. SDPs \ncan be used for IEEE 1588 auxiliary device connections, \nto enable/disable the device, and for other  \nmiscellaneous hardware or software-control purposes. \nThese pins can be individually configured to act as \neither standard inputs, General-Purpose Interrupt (GPI) \ninput or output pins, as well as the default value of all \npins configured as outputs.\nEnergy Efficient Ethernet (EEE)\nSupports the IEEE 802.3az EEE standard so that during \nperiods of low network activity, EEE reduces the power \nconsumption of an Ethernet connection by negotiating \nwith the switch port to transition to a low power idle  \n(LPI) state.\nThis capability reduces power up to 50 percent of its \nnormal operating power, saving power on both the \nnetwork and the switch ports. When increased traffic \nis detected, the controller and the switch quickly come \nback to full power to handle the increased traffic. EEE is \nsupported for both 1000BASE-T and 100BASE-TX.\n22\nMultiple Interface Options\nThe Intel Ethernet Controller I210 provides a fully \nintegrated GbE MAC/PHY, which has integrated power \ncontrol components that can reduce board component \ncost and board layout space. The small 9 mm x 9 mm \npackage size increases board layout flexibility for all \ntypes of client, server, and embedded designs.\nThe I210-AT and I210-IT provide MDI (Copper), a  \nstandard IEEE 802.3 Ethernet interface for  \n1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 10BASE-T applications \n(802.3, 802.3u, and 802.3ab). \nThe I210-IS, I210-CS, and I210-CL provide a SerDes \ninterface to connect over a 1000BASE-BX or \n1000BASE-KX backplane to another SerDes-compliant \ndevice or to an optical module. The I210-IS, I210-CS, \nand I210-CL can also support an SGMII interface for \nSFP and external PHY connections for even greater \ndesign flexibility.\nThe I210CS and I210-CL provide a SerDes or SGMII \ninterface for Automotive applications supporting  \nAEC-Q100 Grade 3.Flexible Design Configurations\nThe I210 can be used for server system configurations \nsuch as rack-mounted or pedestal servers, in an  \nadd-on NIC, in LAN on Motherboard (LOM) designs \nand for blade servers. In the latter case, the I210-IS \ncan support a SerDes port in a LOM design or on a \nblade mezzanine card.\nFor customers needing extended temperature  \nranges, the I210-AT supports commercial  \ntemperature ranges of 0 °C to 70 °C. The I210-IT, \n1210-IS, I210-CS, and I210-CL support -40 °C to  \n85 °C for industrial applications.\nInterfaces for Network Manageability\nThe I210 provides OS2BMC, SMBus and DMTF-  \ndefined Network Controller Sideband Interface  \n(NC-SI) for BMC manageability. In addition, it  \nintroduces support for Management Component \nTransport Protocol (MCTP), a new DMTF standard, \nenabling a BMC to gather information about Intel \nEthernet Controllers that use the data rate, link speed, \nand error counts.\n3\n Features Description\nExternal Interfaces\nPCI Express 2.1 • 2.5 GT/s Support for x1 width (Lane)\nNetwork Interfaces • MDI (Copper) standard IEEE 802.3 Ethernet interface for 1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 10BASE-T applications \n(802.3, 802.3u, and 802.3ab)\n• Serializer-Deserializer (SerDes) to support 1000BASE-SX/LX (optical fiber - IEEE 802.3)\n• Serializer-Deserializer (SerDes) to support 1000BASE-KX (IEEE 802.3ap) and 1000BASE-BX (PICMIG 3.1) for \nGigabit backplane applications\n• SGMII (Serial-GMII Specification) interface for SFP (SFP MSA INF-8074i)/external PHY connections\nPower Management Features\nController is designed for low power consumption • <750 mW S0-Max (state) 1000BASE-T Active 70 °C (Intel® Ethernet Controller I210-AT)\n• <800 mW S0-Max (state) 1000BASE-T Active 85 °C (Intel® Ethernet Controller I210-IT, I210-CS, I210-CL)\n• <550 mW S0-Max (state) 1GbE SerDes/SGMII Active 85 °C (Intel® Ethernet Controller I210-IS, I210-CS, I210-CL)\nIEEE 802.3az - Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) • Power consumption by the PHY is reduced by approximately 50%; link transitions to low power Idle (LPI) state as \ndefined in the IEEE 802.3az (EEE) standard\nSmart power down (SPD) at S0 no link/Sx no link • PHY powers down circuits and clocks that are not required for detection of link activity\nActive State Power Management (ASPM) • Optionality Compliance bit enables ASPM or runs ASPM compliance tests to support entry to L0s\nLAN disable function • Option to disable the LAN Port and/or PCIe Function.
