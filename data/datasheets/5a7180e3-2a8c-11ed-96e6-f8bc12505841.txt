It has four separate  \nregulator  channels  with each of them  capable  of delivering  \nup to 4A continuous  output  current  with few external  input  \nand output  capacitors . Each regulator  provides  precisely  \nregulated  output  voltage  programmable  from 0.6V to 5.5V \nvia a single  external  resistor  (two resistors  for LTM4644 -1) \nover 4V to 14V input  voltage  range . With an external  bias \nvoltage , this module  can operate  from an input  voltage  \nas low as 2.375 V. The typical  application  schematic  is \nshown  in Figure  33.\nThe LTM4644  integrates  four separate  constant  frequency  \ncontrolled  on-time valley  current  mode  regulators , power  \nMOSFETs , inductors , and other  supporting  discrete  com-\nponents . The typical  switching  frequency  is set to 1MHz. \nFor switching  noise -sensitive  applications , the µModule  \nregulator  can be externally  synchronized  to a clock  from \n700kHz to 1.3MHz. See the Applications  Information  \nsection .\nWith current  mode  control  and internal  feedback  loop \ncompensation , the LTM4644  module  has sufficient  stabil -\nity margins  and good  transient  performance  with a wide \nrange  of output  capacitors , even with all ceramic  output  \ncapacitors .\nCurrent  mode  control  provides  the flexibility  of paralleling  \nany of the separate  regulator  channels  with accurate  cur-\nrent sharing . With a built-in clock  interleaving  between  \neach two regulator  channels , the LTM4644  could  easily  employ  a 2+2, 3+1 or 4 channels  parallel  operation  which  \nis more  than flexible  in a multirail  POL application  like \nFPGA . Furthermore , the LTM4644  has CLKIN  and CLK-\nOUT pins for frequency  synchronization  or polyphasing  \nmultiple  devices  which  allow  up to 8 phases  cascaded  to \nrun simultaneously .\nCurrent  mode  control  also provides  cycle -by-cycle  fast \ncurrent  monitoring . Foldback  current  limiting  is provided  \nin an overcurrent  condition  to reduce  the inductor  valley  \ncurrent  to approximately  40% of the original  value  when  \nVFB drops . An internal  overvoltage  and undervoltage  \ncomparators  pull the open -drain  PGOOD  output  low if \nthe output  feedback  voltage  exits a ±10% window  around  \nthe regulation  point . Continuous  conduction  mode  (CCM) \noperation  is forced  during  OV and UV conditions  except  \nduring  start-up when  the TRACK  pin is ramping  up to 0.6V.\nPulling  the RUN pin below  1.1V forces  the controller  into \nits shutdown  state, turning  off both power  MOSFETs  and \nmost  of the internal  control  circuitry . At light load cur-\nrents , discontinuous  conduction  mode  (DCM ) operation  \ncan be enabled  to achieve  higher  efficiency  compared  to \ncontinuous  conduction  mode  (CCM) by setting  the MODE  \npin to SGND . The TRACK /SS pin is used for power  supply  \ntracking  and soft-start programming .

External  component  selection  is primarily  \ndetermined  by the input  voltage , the output  voltage  and \nthe maximum  load current . Refer  to Table  7 for specific  \nexternal  capacitor  requirements  for a particular  application .\nVIN to VOUT Step-Down  Ratios\nThere  are restrictions  in the maximum  VIN and VOUT step-\ndown  ratio that can be achieved  for a given  input  voltage  \ndue to the minimum  off-time and minimum  on-time limits  \nof each regulator . The minimum  off-time limit imposes  a \nmaximum  duty cycle  which  can be calculated  as:\n  DMAX = 1 – tOFF(MIN) • fSW\nwhere  tOFF(MIN) is the minimum  off-time, 70ns typical  for \nLTM4644 , and fSW is the switching  frequency . Conversely  \nthe minimum  on-time limit imposes  a minimum  duty cycle  \nof the converter  which  can be calculated  as:\n DMIN = tON(MIN) • fSW\nwhere  tON(MIN) is the minimum  on-time, 40ns typical  for \nLTM4644 . In the rare cases  where  the minimum  duty \ncycle  is surpassed , the output  voltage  will still remain  \nin regulation , but the switching  frequency  will decrease  \nfrom its programmed  value .

G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS  INFORMATION\nInput  Decoupling  Capacitors\nThe LTM4644  module  should  be connected  to a low ac-\nimpedance  DC source . For each regulator  channel , a 10µF \ninput  ceramic  capacitor  is recommended  for RMS  ripple  \ncurrent  decoupling . A bulk input  capacitor  is only needed  \nwhen  the input  source  impedance  is compromised  by long \ninductive  leads , traces  or not enough  source  capacitance . \nThe bulk capacitor  can be an electrolytic  aluminum  capaci -\ntor or polymer  capacitor .\nWithout  considering  the inductor  ripple  current , the RMS  \ncurrent  of the input  capacitor  can be estimated  as:\n ICIN(RMS)=IOUT(MAX)\nη%•D•(1−D)\nwhere  η% is the estimated  efficiency  of the power  module .\nOutput  Decoupling  Capacitors\nWith an optimized  high frequency , high bandwidth  design , \nonly single  piece  of low ESR output  ceramic  capacitor  is \nrequired  for each regulator  channel  to achieve  low output  \nvoltage  ripple  and very good  transient  response . Additional  \noutput  filtering  may be required  by the system  designer , \nif further  reduction  of output  ripples  or dynamic  transient  \nspikes  is required . Table  7 shows  a matrix  of different  \noutput  voltages  and output  capacitors  to minimize  the \nvoltage  droop  and overshoot  during  a 2A load step tran-\nsient. Multiphase  operation  will reduce  effective  output  \nripple  as a function  of the number  of phases . Application   \nNote 77 discusses  this noise  reduction  versus  output  ripple  \ncurrent  cancellation , but the output  capacitance  will be \nmore  a function  of stability  and transient  response . The \nL TpowerCAD ™ Design  Tool is available  to download  online  \nfor output  ripple , stability  and transient  response  analysis  \nand calculating  the output  ripple  reduction  as the number  \nof phases  implemented  increases  by N times .\nDiscontinuous  Conduction  Mode  (DCM )\nIn applications  where  low output  ripple  and high efficiency  \nat intermediate  current  are desired , discontinuous  con-\nduction  mode  (DCM ) should  be used by connecting  the \nMODE  pin to SGND . At light loads  the internal  current  comparator  may remain  tripped  for several  cycles  and \nforce  the top MOSFET  to stay off for several  cycles , thus \nskipping  cycles . The inductor  current  does not reverse  \nin this mode . \nForce  Continuous  Conduction  Mode  (CCM)\nIn applications  where  fixed frequency  operation  is more  \ncritical  than low current  efficiency , and where  the lowest  \noutput  ripple  is desired , forced  continuous  conduction  \nmode  operation  should  be used. Forced  continuous  opera -\ntion can be enabled  by tying  the MODE  pin to INTV CC. In \nthis mode , inductor  current  is allowed  to reverse  during  \nlow output  loads , the COMP  voltage  is in control  of the \ncurrent  comparator  threshold  throughout , and the top \nMOSFET  always  turns  on with each oscillator  pulse . During  \nstart-up, forced  continuous  mode  is disabled  and inductor  \ncurrent  is prevented  from reversing  until the LTM4644 ’s \noutput  voltage  is in regulation . \nOperating  Frequency\nThe operating  frequency  of the LTM4644  is optimized  to \nachieve  the compact  package  size and the minimum  output  \nripple  voltage  while  still keeping  high efficiency . The default  \noperating  frequency  is internally  set to 1MHz. In most  ap-\nplications , no additional  frequency  adjusting  is required .\nIf any operating  frequency  other  than 1MHz is required  \nby application , the µModule  regulator  can be externally  \nsynchronized  to a clock  from 700kHz to 1.3MHz.\nFrequency  Synchronization  and Clock  In\nThe power  module  has a phase -locked  loop comprised  \nof an internal  voltage  controlled  oscillator  and a phase  \ndetector . This allows  all internal  top MOSFET  turn-on to \nbe locked  to the rising  edge of the same  external  clock . \nThe external  clock  frequency  range  must  be within  ±30% \naround  the 1MHz set frequency . A pulse  detection  circuit  \nis used to detect  a clock  on the CLKIN  pin to turn on the \nphase -locked  loop. The pulse  width  of the clock  has to \nbe at least 400ns. The clock  high level must  be above  2V \nand clock  low level below  0.3V. During  the start-up of \nthe regulator , the phase -locked  loop function  is disabled .\nLTM4644/LTM4644-1\n12\nRev.

The \nLTM4644  can safely  power  up into a pre-biased  output  \nwithout  discharging  it.\nThe LTM4644  accomplishes  this by forcing  discontinuous  \nmode  (DCM ) operation  until the TRACK /SS pin voltage  \nreaches  0.6V reference  voltage . This will prevent  the BG \nfrom turning  on during  the pre-biased  output  start-up \nwhich  would  discharge  the output .\nDo not pre-bias LTM4644  with an output  voltage  higher  \nthan INTV CC (3.3V).\nOvertemperature  Protection\nThe internal  overtemperature  protection  monitors  the junc-\ntion temperature  of the module . If the junction  temperature  \nreaches  approximately  160° C, both power  switches  will be \nturned  off until the temperature  drops  about  15°C cooler . \nLow Input  Application\nThe LTM4644  module  has a separate  SVIN pin for each \nregulator  channel  which  makes  it compatible  with opera -\ntion from an input  voltage  as low as 2.375 V. The SVIN pin \nis the signal  input  of the regulator  control  circuitry  while  \nthe VIN pin is the power  input  which  directly  connected  \nto the drain  of the top MOSFET . In most  application  with \ninput  voltage  ranges  from 4V to 14V, connect  the SVIN \npin directly  to the VIN pin of each regulator  channel .

The temperature  dependence  of this diode  voltage  \ncan be understood  in the equation : \n VD=nVTlnID\nIS⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nwhere  VT is the thermal  voltage  (kT/q), and n, the ideality  \nfactor , is 1 for the diode  connected  PNP transistor  be-\ning used in the LTM4644 . IS is expressed  by the typical  \nempirical  equation :  \n IS=I0exp–VG0\nVT⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nwhere  I0 is a process  and geometry  dependent  current , (I0 \nis typically  around  20k orders  of magnitude  larger  than IS \nat room  temperature ) and VG0 is the band  gap voltage  of \n1.2V extrapolated  to absolute  zero or –273° C. \nIf we take the IS equation  and substitute  into the VD equa-\ntion, then we get:\n VD=VG0–kT\nq⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟lnI0\nID⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟,VT=kT\nq\nThe expression  shows  that the diode  voltage  decreases  \n(linearly  if I0 were constant ) with increasing  temperature  \nand constant  diode  current . Figure  6 shows  a plot of VD \nvs Temperature  over the operating  temperature  range  of \nthe LTM4644 .\nIf we take this equation  and differentiate  it with respect  to \ntemperature  T, then:\n dVD\ndT=–VG0–VD\nT\nThis dVD/dT term is the temperature  coefficient  equal  to \nabout  –2mV/K or –2mV/°C. The equation  is simplified  for \nthe first order  derivation .Solving  for T, T = –( VG0 – VD)/(dVD/dT) provides  the \ntemperature .\n1st Example : Figure  7 for 27°C, or 300 K the diode  \nvoltage  is 0.598 V, thus, 300 K = –(1200 mV – 598 mV)/ \n–2.0 mV/K)\n2nd Example : Figure  7 for 75°C, or 350 K the diode  \nvoltage  is 0.50 V, thus, 350 K = –(1200 mV – 500 mV)/ \n–2.0mV/K)\nConverting  the Kelvin  scale  to Celsius  is simply  taking  the \nKelvin  temp  and subtracting  273 from it.\nA typical  forward  voltage  is given  in the electrical  charac -\nteristics  section  of the data sheet , and Figure  7 is the plot \nof this forward  voltage . Measure  this forward  voltage  at \n27°C to establish  a reference  point . Then  using  the above  \nexpression  while  measuring  the forward  voltage  over \ntemperature  will provide  a general  temperature  monitor . \nConnect  a resistor  between  TEMP  and VIN to set the cur-\nrent to 100µ A.

G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS  INFORMATION\nArray  Surface  Mount  Package  Thermal  Measurements ”). \nThe motivation  for providing  these  thermal  coefficients  in \nfound  in JESD  51-12 (“ Guidelines  for Reporting  and Using  \nElectronic  Package  Thermal  Information ”).\nMany  designers  may opt to use laboratory  equipment  \nand a test vehicle  such as the demo  board  to predict  the \nµModule  regulator ’s thermal  performance  in their appli-\ncation  at various  electrical  and environmental  operating  \nconditions  to compliment  any FEA activities . Without  FEA \nsoftware , the thermal  resistances  reported  in the Pin Con-\nfiguration  section  are in-and-of themselves  not relevant  to \nproviding  guidance  of thermal  performance ; instead , the \nderating  curves  provided  in this data sheet  can be used \nin a manner  that yields  insight  and guidance  pertaining  to \none’s application -usage , and can be adapted  to correlate  \nthermal  performance  to one’s own application .\nThe Pin Configuration  section  typically  gives  four thermal  \ncoefficients  explicitly  defined  in JESD  51-12; these  coef-\nficients  are quoted  or paraphrased  below :\n1. θJA, the thermal  resistance  from junction  to ambient , is \nthe natural  convection  junction -to-ambient  air thermal  \nresistance  measured  in a one cubic  foot sealed  enclo -\nsure. This environment  is sometimes  referred  to as \n“still air” although  natural  convection  causes  the air to \nmove . This value  is determined  with the part mounted  to \na JESD  51-9 defined  test board , which  does not reflect  \nan actual  application  or viable  operating  condition .\n2. θJCbottom , the thermal  resistance  from junction  to the \nbottom  of the product  case, is determined  with all of \nthe component  power  dissipation  flowing  through  the \nbottom  of the page. In the typical  µModule  regulator , \nthe bulk of the heat flows  out the bottom  of the pack-\nage, but there  is always  heat flow out into the ambient  \nenvironment . As a result , this thermal  resistance  value  \nmay be useful  for comparing  packages  but the test \nconditions  don’t generally  match  the user’s application .\n3. θJCtop, the thermal  resistance  from junction  to top of \nthe product  case, is determined  with nearly  all of the \ncomponent  power  dissipation  flowing  through  the top of \nthe package . As the electrical  connections  of the typical  \nµModule  regulator  are on the bottom  of the package , it is rare for an application  to operate  such that most  of \nthe heat flows  from the junction  to the top of the part. \nAs in the case of θJCbottom , this value  may be useful  \nfor comparing  packages  but the test conditions  don’t \ngenerally  match  the user’s application .\n4. θJB, the thermal  resistance  from junction  to the printed  \ncircuit  board , is the junction -to-board  thermal  resistance  \nwhere  almost  all of the heat flows  through  the bottom  of \nthe µModule  regulator  and into the board , and is really  \nthe sum of the θJCbottom  and the thermal  resistance  of \nthe bottom  of the part through  the solder  joints  and \nthrough  a portion  of the board . The board  temperature  \nis measured  a specified  distance  from the package .\nA graphical  representation  of the aforementioned  ther-\nmal resistances  is given  in Figure  8; blue resistances  are \ncontained  within  the μModule  regulator , whereas  green  \nresistances  are external  to the µModule  package .\nAs a practical  matter , it should  be clear to the reader  that \nno individual  or sub-group  of the four thermal  resistance  \nparameters  defined  by JESD  51-12 or provided  in the \nPin Configuration  section  replicates  or conveys  normal  \noperating  conditions  of a μModule  regulator . For example , \nin normal  board -mounted  applications , never  does 100% \nof the device ’s total power  loss (heat) thermally  conduct  \nexclusively  through  the top or exclusively  through  bot-\ntom of the µModule  package —as the standard  defines  \nfor θJCtop and θJCbottom , respectively . In practice , power  \nloss is thermally  dissipated  in both directions  away  from \nthe package —granted , in the absence  of a heat sink and \nairflow , a majority  of the heat flow is into the board .\nWithin  the LTM4644 , be aware  there  are multiple  power  \ndevices  and components  dissipating  power , with a con-\nsequence  that the thermal  resistances  relative  to different  \njunctions  of components  or die are not exactly  linear  with \nrespect  to total package  power  loss. To reconcile  this \ncomplication  without  sacrificing  modeling  simplicity —\nbut also, not ignoring  practical  realities —an approach  \nhas been taken  using  FEA software  modeling  along  with \nlaboratory  testing  in a controlled -environment  chamber  \nto reasonably  define  and correlate  the thermal  resistance  \nvalues  supplied  in this data sheet : (1) Initially , FEA software  \nLTM4644/LTM4644-1\n18\nRev.

An outcome  of this process  \nand due diligence  yields  the set of derating  curves  shown  \nin this data sheet . \nThe 1V to 5V power  loss curves  in Figures  9 to 15 can \nbe used in coordination  with the load current  derating  \ncurves  in Figures  16 to 29 for calculating  an approximate  \nθJA thermal  resistance  for the LTM4644  with various  heat \nsinking  and airflow  conditions . The power  loss curves  \nare taken  at room  temperature , and are increased  with a \nmultiplicative  factor  according  to the junction  temperature . \nThis approximate  factor  is 1.35 for 120° C. The derating  \ncurves  are plotted  with the output  current  starting  at 16A \nand the ambient  temperature  at 30°C. These  are chosen  \nto include  the lower  and higher  output  voltage  ranges  APPLICATIONS  INFORMATION\nfor correlating  the thermal  resistance . Thermal  models  \nare derived  from several  temperature  measurements  in a \ncontrolled  temperature  chamber  along  with thermal  mod-\neling analysis . The junction  temperatures  are monitored  \nwhile  ambient  temperature  is increased  with and without  \nairflow . The power  loss increase  with ambient  temperature  \nchange  is factored  into the derating  curves . The junctions  \nare maintained  at 120° C maximum  while  lowering  output  \ncurrent  or power  with increasing  ambient  temperature . The \ndecreased  output  current  will decrease  the internal  module  \nloss as ambient  temperature  is increased . The monitored  \njunction  temperature  of 120° C minus  the ambient  operat -\ning temperature  specifies  how much  module  temperature  \nrise can be allowed . As an example  in Figure  16 the load \ncurrent  is derated  to 9.6A at ~90° C with 400LFM of airflow  \nand no heat sink and the power  loss for the 12V to 1.0V \nat 9.5A output  is about  3.2W. The 3.2W loss is calculated  \nwith 4 times  the 0.6W room  temperature  loss from the \n12V to 1.0V power  loss curve  each channel  at 2.4A, and \nthe 1.35 multiplying  factor  at 120° C junction . If the 90°C \nambient  temperature  is subtracted  from the 120° C junc-\ntion temperature , then the difference  of 30°C divided  by \n3.2W equals  ~9.4° C/W θJA thermal  resistance . Table  3 \nspecifies  a 10°C/W value  which  is very close . Tables  3 to \n6 provide  equivalent  thermal  resistances  for the different  \noutputs  with and without  airflow  and heat sinking .

The printed  circuit  board  is a 1.6mm \nthick four layer board  with two ounce  copper  for the two \nouter  layers  and one ounce  copper  for the two inner  layers . \nThe PCB dimensions  are 95mm × 76 mm.\nThe 16A represents  all four channels  in parallel  at 4A each. \nThe four parallel  channels  have their currents  reduced  at \nthe same  rate to develop  an equivalent  θJA circuit  evalu -\nation  with thermal  couples  or IR camera  used to validate  \nthe thermal  resistance  values . \nMaximum  Operating  Ambient  Temperature\nFigures  30 and 31 display  the Maximum  Power  Loss \nAllowance  Curves  vs ambient  temperature  with various  \nheat sinking  and airflow  conditions .  This data was derived  \nfrom the thermal  impedance  generated  by various  ther-\nmal derating  examinations  with the junction  temperature  \nmeasured  at 120° C. This maximum  power  loss limitation  \nserves  as a guideline  when  designing  multiple  output  \nrails with different  voltages  and currents  by calculating  \nthe total power  loss. For example , to determine  the maximum  ambient  tem-\nperature  when  VOUT1 = 2.5 V at 0.6A, VOUT2 = 3.3 V at 3A, \nVOUT3 = 1.8 V at 1A, VOUT4 = 1.2 V at 3A, without  a heat sink \nand 400LFM airflow , simply  add up the total power  loss \nfor each channel  read from Figure  9 to Figure  15 which  in \nthis example  equals  2.5W, then multiply  by the 1.35 coef-\nficient  for 120° C junction  temperature  and  compare  the \ntotal power  loss number , 3.4W with Figure  30. Figure  30 \nindicates  with a 3.4W total power  loss, the maximum  am-\nbient  temperature  for this particular  application  is around  \n86°C. For reference , the actual  thermal  derating  test in the \nchamber  resulted  in a maximum  ambient  temperature  \nof 86.3° C, very close  to the calculated  value . Also from  \nFigure  30, it is easy to determine  with a 3.4W total power  \nloss, the maximum  ambient  temperature  is around  77°C \nwith no airflow  and 81°C with 200LFM airflow .\nSafety  Considerations\nThe LTM4644  modules  do not provide  galvanic  isolation  \nfrom VIN to VOUT. There  is no internal  fuse. If required , \na slow blow fuse with a rating  twice  the maximum  input  \ncurrent  needs  to be provided  to protect  each unit from \ncatastrophic  failure .

G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS  INFORMATION\nLayout  Checklist /Example\nThe high integration  of LTM4644  makes  the PCB board  \nlayout  very simple  and easy. However , to optimize  its \nelectrical  and thermal  performance , some  layout  consid -\nerations  are still necessary .\n• Use large  PCB copper  areas  for high current  paths , \nincluding  VIN1 to VIN4, GND, VOUT1 to VOUT4. It helps  to \nminimize  the PCB conduction  loss and thermal  stress .\n• Place  high frequency  ceramic  input  and output  capaci -\ntors next to the VIN, GND and VOUT pins to minimize  \nhigh frequency  noise .\n• Place  a dedicated  power  ground  layer underneath  the \nunit.• To minimize  the via conduction  loss and reduce  module  \nthermal  stress , use multiple  vias for interconnection  \nbetween  top layer and other  power  layers .\n• Do not put via directly  on the pad, unless  they are \ncapped  or plated  over.\n• Use a separated  SGND  ground  copper  area for com-\nponents  connected  to signal  pins. Connect  the SGND  \nto GND underneath  the unit.\n• For parallel  modules , tie the VOUT, VFB, and COMP  pins \ntogether . Use an internal  layer to closely  connect  these  \npins together . The TRACK /SS pin can be tied a common  \ncapacitor  for regulator  soft-start.\n• Bring  out test points  on the signal  pins for monitoring . \nFigure  32 gives  a good  example  of the recommended  layout .\nFigure  32.
