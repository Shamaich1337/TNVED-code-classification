B | Page 9 of 12 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADRF5020  requires a positive supply voltage applied to the \nVDD pin and a negative supply voltage applied to the VSS pin. Bypassing capacitors are recommended on the supply lines to \nminimize RF coupling. \nThe ADRF5020  is internally matched to 50 Ω at the RF \ncommon port (RFC) and the RF throw ports (RF1 and RF2); \ntherefore, no external matching components are required. All of \nthe RF ports are dc-coupled to 0 V , and no dc blocking is required at the RF ports when the RF line potential is equal to 0 V . The design is bidirectional; the RF input signal can be applied to the RFC port while the RF throw port (RF1 or RF2) is output or vice versa. \nThe ADRF5020  incorporates a driver to perform logic functions \ninternally and to provide the user with the advantage of a simplified \ncontrol interface. The driver features two digital control input \npins, CTRL and EN.  \nWhen the EN pin is logic low, the RF1 to RFC path is in an \ninsertion loss state, and the RF2 to RFC path is in an isolation state, or vice versa, depending on the logic level applied to the CTRL pin. The insertion loss path (for example, RF1 to RFC) \nconducts the RF signal equally well in both directions between \nits throw port (for example, RF1) and common port (RFC). The isolation path (for example, RF2 to RFC) provides high loss between the insertion loss path and its throw port (for example, \nRF2) terminated to an internal 50 Ω resistor. When the EN pin is logic high, both the RF1 to RFC path and \nthe RF2 to RFC path are in an isolation state regardless of the logic state of CTRL. RF1 and RF2 ports are terminated to \ninternal 50 Ω resistors, and RFC becomes open reflective. \nThe ideal power-up sequence is as follows:  \n1. Connect EPAD and GND pins to ground reference. \n2. Power up VDD and VSS. Powering up VSS after VDD \navoids current transients on VDD during ramp up. \n3. Apply the digital control inputs CTRL and EN. Applying \ndigital control inputs before the VDD supply can inadvertently forward bias and damage the internal ESD protection structures. A series 1.5 kΩ resistor can be used to limit the current flowing into the control pin in this \ncase. If the control pins are not driven to a valid logic state \n(for example, the controller output is in high impedance state) after VDD is powered up, it is recommended to use pull up/down resistors. \n4. Apply an RF input signal. \nThe ideal power-down sequence is the reverse order of the \npower-up sequence. \n \n \nTable 4.

Top dielectric \nmaterial is 8  mil Rogers RO4003, offering good high frequency \nperformance. The middle and bottom dielectric materials are \nFR-4 type materials to achieve an overall board thickness of 62 mil.  \nThe RF transmission lines wer e designed using a coplanar \nwaveguide (CPWG) model with a width of 14 mil and ground \nspacing of 5  mil to have a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. For \ngood RF and thermal grounding, as many plated  through vias \nas possible are arranged around transmission lines and under \nthe exposed pad of the package.  Figure 20 shows the actual ADRF5020 evaluation board with \ncomponent placement. Two power supply ports are connected \nto the VDD and VSS test points, TP5 and TP2, and the ground \nreference is connected to the GND test point, TP1. On each \nsupply trace, a 100 pF bypass capacitor is used, and unpopulated  \ncomponents positions are available for applying extra bypass \ncapacitors.  \n14581-020 \nFigure 20.
