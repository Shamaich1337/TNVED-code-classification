The output level is referenced to the supply voltage and is able \nto support 1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, and 5-V CMOS levels. The input is designed with a lower threshold circuit to \nmatch 1.8 V input logic at V CC = 3.3 V and can be used in 1.8 V to 3.3 V level-up translation. In addition, the \n5 V tolerant input pins enable down translation (that is, 3.3 V to 2.5 V output at V CC = 2.5 V). The wide V CC \nrange of 1.8 V to 5.5 V allows generation of desired output levels to connect to controllers or processors. The \nSN74LV1T34  device is designed with current-drive capability of 8 mA to reduce line reflections, overshoot, and \nundershoot caused by high-drive outputs.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\n2 4\nA Y\nFigure 9-1.

The term balanced  indicates that the device can sink \nand source similar currents. The drive capability of this device may create fast edges into light loads so routing \nand load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing. Additionally, the outputs of this device are capable \nof driving larger currents than the device can sustain without being damaged. It is important for the output power \nof the device to be limited to avoid damage due to overcurrent. The electrical and thermal limits defined in the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  must be followed at all times.\nUnused push-pull CMOS outputs should be left disconnected.SN74LV1T34\nSCLS743C – DECEMBER 2013 – REVISED JUNE 2022 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV1T34\n9.3.3 LVxT Enhanced Input Voltage\nThe SN74LV1T34  belongs to TI\'s LVxT family of Logic devices with integrated voltage level translation. This \nfamily of devices was designed with reduced input voltage thresholds to support up-translation, and inputs \ntolerant of signals with up to 5.5 V levels to support down-translation. The output voltage will always be \nreferenced to the supply voltage (V CC), as described in the Electrical Characteristics  table. To ensure proper \nfunctionality, input signals must remain at or below the specified V IH(MIN)  level for a HIGH input state, and at or \nbelow the specified V IL(MAX)  for a LOW input state. Figure 9-3  shows the typical V IH and V IL levels for the LVxT \nfamily of devices, as well as the voltage levels for standard CMOS devices for comparison.\nThe inputs are high impedance and are typically modeled as a resistor in parallel with the input capacitance \ngiven in the Electrical Characteristics . The worst case resistance is calculated with the maximum input voltage, \ngiven in the Absolute Maximum Ratings , and the maximum input leakage current, given in the Electrical \nCharacteristics , using Ohm\'s law (R = V ÷ I).\nThe inputs require that input signals transition between valid logic states quickly, as defined by the input \ntransition time or rate in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table. Failing to meet this specification \nwill result in excessive power consumption and could cause oscillations. More details can be found in the \nImplications of Slow or Floating CMOS Inputs  application report.\nDo not leave inputs floating at any time during operation. Unused inputs must be terminated at V CC or GND. If \na system will not be actively driving an input at all times, a pull-up or pull-down resistor can be added to provide \na valid input voltage during these times. The resistor value will depend on multiple factors; however, a 10-k Ω \nresistor is recommended and will typically meet all requirements.\nVCC- Supply Voltage (V)VIN- Input Voltage (V)\n1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 4.2 4.4 4.6 4.8 5 5.2 5.500.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.822.22.42.62.833.23.43.6\n1.2-V CMOS1.8-V CMOS2.5-V CMOS3.3-V CMOS\n1.1 V (V OH)1.45 V (V OH)2 V (V OH)2.4 V (V OH)\n0.3 V (V OL)0.45 V (V OL)0.4 V (V OL) 0.4 V (V OL)VIH\nVIL\nHIGH Input\nLOW Input\nFigure 9-3. LVxT Input Voltage Levels\n9.3.3.1 Down Translation\nSignals can be translated down using the SN74LV1T34 . The voltage applied at the V CC will determine the \noutput voltage and the input thresholds as described in the Recommended Operating Conditions  and Electrical \nCharacteristics  tables.\nWhen connected to a high-impedance input, the output voltage will be approximately V CC in the HIGH state, and \n0 V in the LOW state. Ensure that the input signals in the HIGH state are between V IH(MIN)  and 5.5 V, and input \nsignals in the LOW state are lower than V IL(MAX)  as shown in Figure 9-3 .\nFor example, standard CMOS inputs for devices operating at 5.0 V, 3.3 V or 2.5 V can be down-translated to \nmatch 1.8 V CMOS signals when operating from 1.8-V V CC.

The voltage applied at V CC will determine the \noutput voltage and the input thresholds as described in the Recommended Operating Conditions  and Electrical \nCharacteristics  tables. When connected to a high-impedance input, the output voltage will be approximately V CC \nin the HIGH state, and 0 V in the LOW state.\nThe inputs have reduced thresholds that allow for input high-state levels which are much lower than standard \nvalues. For example, standard CMOS inputs for a device operating at a 5-V supply will have a V IH(MIN)  of 3.5 V. \nFor the SN74LV1T34 , VIH(MIN)  with a 5-V supply is only 2 V, which would allow for up-translation from a typical \n2.5-V to 5-V signals.\nEnsure that the input signals in the HIGH state are above V IH(MIN)  and input signals in the LOW state are lower \nthan V IL(MAX)  as shown in Figure 9-4 .\nUp Translation Combinations :\n•1.8-V V CC – Inputs from 1.2 V\n•2.5-V V CC – Inputs from 1.8 V\n•3.3-V V CC – Inputs from 1.8 V and 2.5 V\n•5.0-V V CC – Inputs from 2.5 V and 3.3 V\nVIH = 2.0 V\nVIL = 0.8 VVIH = 0.99 V\nVIL = 0.5 V\n5.0 V\n3.3 V\nSystemVcc = 5.0 V\nLV1Txx Logic5.0 V\nSystemVcc = 1.8 V\n5.0 V, 3.3 V\n2.5 V, 1.8 V\n1.5 V, 1.2 V\nSystemLV1Txx Logic1.8 V\nSystem\nFigure 9-4.

Each V CC terminal should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power \ndisturbance. A 0.1- μF capacitor is recommended for this device. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass caps \nto reject different frequencies of noise. The 0.1- μF and 1- μF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The \nbypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results, as shown in the \nfollowing layout example.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple-input and multiple-channel logic devices inputs must not ever be left floating. In many \ncases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused; for example, when only two inputs of a \ntriple-input AND gate are used or only 3 of the 4 buffer gates are used. Such unused input pins must not be left \nunconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. \nAll unused inputs of digital logic devices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the \ninput voltage specifications, to prevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular \nunused input depends on the function of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or V CC, whichever \nmakes more sense for the logic function or is more convenient.www.ti.comSN74LV1T34\nSCLS743C – DECEMBER 2013 – REVISED JUNE 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LV1T34\n12 Device and Documentation Support\n12.1 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
