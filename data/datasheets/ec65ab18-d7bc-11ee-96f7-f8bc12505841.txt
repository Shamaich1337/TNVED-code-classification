It consists of a \nlow noise , digital  phase frequency d etector  (PFD ), a precision \ncharge pump, a programmable reference divider, programmable A counter and B counter , and a dual -modulus prescaler (P/P  + 1). \nThe A (6 -bit) counter and B (13 -bit) counter, in conjunction \nwith the dual -modulus pres caler (P/P + 1), implement an N \ndivider (N  = BP + A). In addition, the 14 -bit reference counter \n(R Counter) allows selectable REF\nIN frequencies at the PFD \ninput. A complete phase -locked loop  (PLL ) can be implemented \nif the synthesizer is used with an exter nal loop filter and voltage \ncontrolled oscillator  (VCO ). Its very high bandwidth means \nthat frequency doublers can be eliminated in many high frequency systems, simplifying system architecture and \nreducing cost.  \nFUNCTIONAL  BLOCK  DIAGRAM  \n02720-001CLK\nDATA\nLEREF IN\nRFINA\nRFINB24-BIT INPUT\nREGISTER\nSDOUTAVDD DVDD\nCE AGND DGND14-BIT\nR COUNTER\nR COUNTER\nLATCH\n2214\nFUNCTION\nLATCH\nA, B COUNTER\nLATCH FROM\nFUNCTION\nLATCH\nPRESCALER\nP/P + 1N = BP + A\nLOAD\nLOAD13-BIT\nB COUNTER\n6-BIT\nA COUNTER\n619\n13\nM3 M2 M1MUX\nSDOUTAVDDHIGH Z\nMUXOUTCPGND RSET VP\nCPPHASE\nFREQUENCY\nDETECTOR\nLOCK\nDETECTREFERENCE\nCHARGE\nPUMP\nCURRENT\nSETTING 1\nADF4106CPI3 CPI2 CPI1 CPI6 CPI5 CPI4CURRENT\nSETTING 2\nF\nigure 1.  \nR\nev.

The prescaler value should be chosen to ensure that the RF input is divided down to a frequency that \nis less than this value.  \n4 AV DD = DV DD = 3 V . \n5 AC coupling ensures AV DD/2 bias.  \n6 Guaranteed by design. Sample tested to ensure compliance.  \n7 TA = 25°C; AV DD = DV DD = 3 V; P = 16; RF IN = 900 MHz.  \n8 TA = 25°C; AV DD = DV DD = 3 V; P = 16; RF IN = 2.0 GHz.  \n9 TA = 25°C; AV DD = DV DD = 3 V; P = 32; RF IN = 6.0 GHz.  \n10 TA = 25°C; AV DD = DV DD = 3.3 V; R = 16383; A = 63; B = 891; P = 32; RF IN = 6.0 GHz.  \n11 The synthesizer phase noise floor is estimated by measuring the in -band phase noise at the output of the VCO and subtracting 20  log N (where N is the N divider  \nvalue) and 10  log FPFD. PN SYNTH  = PN TOT − 10  log FPFD − 20  log N. \n12 The PLL phase noise is composed of 1/f (flicker) noise plus the normalized PLL noise floor. The formula for calculating the 1 /f noise contribution at an RF frequency, f RF, \nand at a freque ncy offset , f, is given by PN = P N1_f + 10  log(10 kHz/f) + 20  log(f RF/1 GHz). Both the normalized phase noise floor and flicker noise are modeled in \nADIsimPLL . \n13 The phase noise is measured with the EV-ADF4106SD1Z evaluation board and the Agilent E4440A Spectrum Analyzer. The spectrum analyzer provides the REFIN for \nthe synthesizer (f REFOUT  = 10 MHz @ 0 dBm).  \n14 fREFIN = 10 MHz; f PFD = 200 kHz; Offset Frequency = 1 kHz; f RF = 900 MHz; N = 4500; Loo p B/W = 20 kHz.  \n15 fREFIN = 10 MHz; f PFD = 200 kHz; Offset Frequency = 1 kHz; f RF = 5800 MHz; N = 29000; Loop B/W = 20 kHz.  \n16 fREFIN = 10 MHz; f PFD = 1 MHz; Offset Frequency = 1 kHz; f RF = 5800 MHz; N = 5800; Loop B/W = 100 kHz.  \n \nTIMING CHARACTERISITICS \nAV DD = DV DD = 3 V ± 10%, AV DD ≤ V P ≤ 5.5 V , AGND = DGND = CPGND = 0 V , R SET = 5.1  kΩ, dBm referred to 50 Ω, T A = T MAX to T MIN, \nunless otherwise noted.  \nTable 2.  \nParameter  Limit1 (B Version) Unit  Test Conditions/Comments \nt1 10 ns min  DATA to CLOCK Setup Time  \nt2 10 ns min  DATA to CLOCK Hold Time  \nt3 25 ns min  CLOCK High Duration  \nt4 25 ns min  CLOCK Low Duration  \nt5 10 ns min  CLOCK to LE Setup Time  \nt6 20 ns min  LE Pulse Width  \n1 Operating temperature range (B Version) is –40°C to +85°C.  \n \nRev.

SW3 is a normally open switch. \nWhen power-down is initiated, SW3 is closed and SW1 and SW2 are opened. This ensures that there is no loading of the REF\nIN pin on power-down. \n02720-017100k\uf057NC\nREF INNC\nNOSW1SW2\nBUFFER\nSW3TO R COUNTERPOWER-DOWN\nCONTROL\n \nFigure 17.

RF Input Stage \nPRESCALER (P/P +1) \nThe dual-modulus prescaler (P/P + 1), along with the A counter \nand B counter, enables the large division ratio, N, to be realized \n(N = BP + A). The dual-modulus prescaler, operating at CML levels, takes the clock from the RF input stage and divides it down to a manageable frequency for the CMOS A counter and B counter. The prescaler is programmable. It can be set in soft-\nware to 8/9, 16/17, 32/33, or 64/65. It is based on a synchronous \n4/5 core. There is a minimum divide ratio possible for fully contiguous output frequencies. This minimum is determined by \nP , the prescaler value, and is given by (P\n2 − P). A COUNTER AND B COUNTER \nThe A counter and B CMOS counter combine with the dual \nmodulus prescaler to allow a wide ranging division ratio in the \nPLL feedback counter. The counters are specified to work when the prescaler output is 325 MHz or less. Thus, with an RF input \nfrequency of 4.0 GHz, a prescaler value of 16/17 is valid, but a \nvalue of 8/9 is not valid. \nPulse Swallow Function \nThe A counter and B counter, in conjunction with the dual-\nmodulus prescaler, make it possible to generate output \nfrequencies that are spaced only by the reference frequency divided by R. The equation for the VCO frequency is  \n\uf028\uf029\uf05b\uf05dRREFINf\nA B PVCOf \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf03d  \nwhere: \nfVCO is the output frequency of the external voltage controlled \noscillator (VCO). \nP is the preset modulus of the dual-modulus prescaler  \n(8/9, 16/17, etc.). \nB is the preset divide ratio of the binary 13-bit counter  \n(3 to 8191). \nA is the preset divide ratio of the binary 6-bit swallow  \ncounter (0 to 63). \nfREFIN is the external reference frequency oscillator. \nLOAD\nLOADFROM RF\nINPUT STAGEPRESCALER\nP/P + 113-BIT B\nCOUNTERTO PFD\n6-BIT A\nCOUNTER\nN DIVIDERMODULUS\nCONTROLN = BP + A\n02720-019 \nFigure 19. A and B Counters \nR COUNTER \nThe 14-bit R counter allows the input reference frequency to  \nbe divided down to produce the reference clock to the phase \nfrequency detector (PFD). Division ratios from 1 to 16,383  \nare allowed. \n \nData Sheet ADF4106  \n \nPHASE FREQUENC Y DETECTOR (PFD) AND \nCHARGE PUMP  \nThe PFD takes inputs from the R counter and N counter \n(N = BP + A) and produces an output proportional to the  \nphase and frequency difference between them.  Figure 20 is a \nsimplified schematic. The P FD includes a programmable delay \nelement that controls the width of the antibacklash pulse. This \npulse ensures that there is no dead zone in the PFD transfer function and minimizes phase noise and reference spurs. Two bits in the reference counter latch , ABP2 and ABP1, control the \nwidth of the pulse.

PFD Simplified Schematic  \nMUXOUT AND LOCK DETE CT \nThe output multiplexer on the ADF4106 allows the user  \nto access various internal points on the chip. The state of MUXOUT is controlled by M3, M2, and M1 in the  function \nlatch. Table 9 shows the full truth table. Figure 21 shows th e \nMUXOUT section in block diagram form.  \nLock Detect  \nMUXOUT can be programmed for two types of lock detect: digital lock detect and analog lock detect.  \nDigital lock detect is active high. When LDP in the R counter \nlatch is set to 0, digital lock detect is set high when the phase \nerror on three consecutive phase detec tor cycles is less than \n15 ns. With LDP set to 1, five consecutive cycles of less than \n15 ns are required to set the lock detect. It stay s set high until a \nphase error of greater than 25  ns is d etected on any subsequent \nPD cycle.  The N -channel , open -drain , analog lock detect should be \noperated with an external pull -up resistor of 10  kΩ nominal. \nWhen lock is  detected , this output is high with narrow, low -\ngoing pulses.  \n02720-021DGNDDVDD\nCONTROL MUXANALOG LOCK DETECT\nDIGITAL LOCK DETECT\nR COUNTER OUTPUT\nN COUNTER OUTPUT\nSDOUTMUXOUT\n \nFigure 21. MUXOUT Circuit  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nThe ADF4106 digital section includes a 24 -bit input shift \nregister, a 14 -bit R counter, and a 19- bit N counter, comprising a \n6-bit A counter and a 13 -bit B counter. Data is clocked into the \n24-bit shift register on each rising edge of CLK. T he data is \nclocked in MSB first. Data is transferred from the shift register \nto one of four latches on the rising edge of LE. The destination latch is determined by the state of the two control bits (C2, C1) in the shift register. These are the two LSBs, D B1 and DB0, as \nshown in the timing diagram of Figure 2. The truth table for \nthese bits is shown in Table 5. Table 6 shows a summary of how \nthe latches are programmed.  \nTable 5.

F | Page 16 of 24 \nData Sheet ADF4106  \n \nTHE FUNCTION LATCH  \nWith C2  and C1 set to 1  and 0, respectively, the on -chip \nfunction latch is programmed. Table 9 shows the input data \nformat for programming the function l atch.  \nCounter Reset  \nDB2 (F1) is the counter reset bit. When this is 1, the R counter \nand the N (A, B) counter are reset. For normal operation , this \nbit should be 0. When  powering up, disable the F1 bit (set to 0) . \nThe N counter will then resume counting in close alignment \nwith the R counter. (The maximum error is one prescaler cycle).  \nPower -Down  \nDB3 (PD1) and DB21 (PD2) provide programmable power -\ndown modes. They are enabled by the CE pin.  \nWhen the CE pin is low, the device is immediately disabled \nregardless of the states of PD2, PD1.  \nIn the programmed asynchronous power -down, the device \npowers dow n immediately after latching 1 into the PD1  bit, \nwith the condition that PD2 is  loaded with 0.  \nIn the programmed synchrono us power -down, the device \npower -down is gated by the charge pump to prevent unwanted \nfrequency jumps. Once the power -down is enabled b y writing 1 \ninto the PD1 bit (provided  that 1 has also been loaded to PD2), \nthen the device goes into power -down during the next charge \npump event.  \nWhen a power -down is activated (either synchronous or \nasynchronous mode, i ncluding CE pin activated power -down), \nthe following events occur:  \n• All active dc current paths are removed.  \n• The R, N, and timeout counters are forced to their load state conditions.  \n• The charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n• The digital clock detect circuitry is reset.  \n• The RF\nIN input  is debiased.  \n• The reference input buffer circuitry is disabled.  \n• The input register remains active and capable of loading and \nlatching data.  \nMUXOUT Control \nThe on -chip multiplexer is controlled by M3, M2, and M1  on \nthe ADF4106 family. Table 9 shows the truth table.  \nFastlock Enable Bit  \nDB9 of the function la tch is the fastlock enable b it. When this \nbit is 1, fastlock is enabled.  Fastlock Mode Bit  \nDB10 of the function latch i s the fastlock mode bit. When \nfastlock is enabled, this bit determines which fastlock m ode is \nused. If the fastlock mod e bit is 0, then Fastlock Mode 1 is \nselected ; and if the fastlock mo de bit is 1, then Fastlock Mode 2 \nis selected.  \nFastlock Mode 1  \nThe ch arge pump current is switched to the contents of Current \nSetting 2. The device enters f astlock when  1 is written to the CP \ngain bit in the N ( A, B) counter latch. The device exits fastlock \nwhen  0 is written to the CP gain bit in the N (A, B) counter \nlatch.  \nFastlock Mode 2  \nThe charge pump current is switched to the contents of Current \nSetting 2. The device enters f astlock when  1 is written to the CP \ngain bit in the N ( A, B) counter latch. The device exits fastlock \nunder the control of the timer c ounter. Afte r the timeout \nperiod , which is  determined by the value in TC4 to TC1, the CP \ngain bit in the N ( A, B) counter latch is automatically reset to 0 , \nand the device reverts to normal mode instead of f astlock. See \nTable 9 for the timeout  periods.  \nTimer Counter Control  \nThe user has the option of programming two charge pump \ncurrents. The intent is that Current Setting 1 is used when the \nRF output is stable and the system is in a static state. Current \nSetting 2 is used when the system is dyn amic and in a state of \nchange ( that is , when a new output frequency is programmed).  \nThe normal sequence of events follows . \nThe user initially decides what the preferred charge pump \ncurrents are going to be. For example, the choice may be  \n2.5 mA as Current  Setting 1 and 5  mA as the Current Setting 2.  \nSimultaneously,  the decision must be made as to how long the \nsecondary current stay s active before reverting to the primary \ncurrent. This is controlled by the  timer counter control bit s, \nDB14 to DB11 (TC4 to TC1), in the function la tch. The truth \ntable is given in Table 9. \nTo program a new output frequency, simply program the N (A, \nB) counter latch with new values for A and B. Simultaneously,  \nthe CP gain bit can be set to  1, which sets t he charge pump with \nthe value in CPI6  to CPI4 for a period of time determined by \nTC4  to TC1. When this time is up, the charge pump current \nreverts to the value set by CPI3  to CPI1. At the same time , the \nCP gain bit in the N (A, B) counter latch is reset to  0 and is now \nready for the next time the user wishes to change the frequency.  \nNote that there is an enable feature on the timer cou nter. It is \nenabled when Fastlock Mode 2 is chosen by setting the fastlock \nmode bit (DB10) in the function lat ch to 1.  \nRev. F | Page 17 of 24 \nADF4106  Data Sheet \n \nChar ge Pump Currents  \nCPI3, CPI2, and CPI1 program Current Setting 1 for the charge \npump. CPI6, CPI5, and CPI4 program Current Setting 2 for the charge pump. The truth table is given in Table 9. \nPrescaler Value  \nP2 and P1 in the function  latch set the prescaler values. The \nprescaler value should be chosen so that the prescaler output frequency is always less than or equal to 325 MHz. Th erefore , \nwith an RF frequency of 4 GHz, a prescaler value of 16/17 is \nvalid , but a value of 8/9 is not v alid.  \nPD Polarity  \nThis bit sets the phase detector polarity b it. See Table 9. \nCP Three -State  \nThis bit controls the CP output pin. With the bit set high, the \nCP output is put into three -state. With the bit set low, the CP \noutput is enabled.  \nTHE INITIALIZATION L ATCH  \nWhen C2  and C1 = 1 and 1, respectively,  the initialization l atch \nis programmed. This is essentially the same as the function \nlatch (programmed when C2  and C1 = 1  and 0, respectively ). \nHowever, when the initialization l atch is programmed, there is \nan additional internal reset pulse applied to the R and N ( A, B) \ncounters. This pulse ensures that the N ( A, B) counter is at the \nload point when the N (A, B) counter data is latched and the \ndevice begin s counting in close phase al ignment.  \nIf the l atch is programmed for synchronous power -down (CE \npin is high , PD1 bit is high, and PD2 bit is low), the internal \npulse also triggers this power -down. The prescaler reference \nand the oscillator input buffer are unaffected by the internal reset pulse; therefore,  close phase alignment is maintained when \ncounting resumes.  \nWhen the first N (A, B) counter data is latched after \ninitialization, the internal reset pulse is again activated. \nHowever, successive N (A, B) counter loads after this will not \ntrigger the internal reset pulse.  \nDevice Programming A fter Initial Power -Up \nAfter initial power up of the device, there are three methods  for \nprogram ming  the device: initialization latch, CE pin, and \ncounter reset.  \nInitialization Latch Method  \n• Apply V DD. \n• Program the initialization latc h (11 in two LSBs of input \nword). Make sure that the F1 bit is programmed to 0.  \n• Do a function latc h load (10 in two LSBs of the control \nword), making sure that the F1 bit is programmed to a 0.  \n• Do an R load (00 in two LSBs ).  • Do an N ( A, B) load (01 in two LSBs). \nWhen the initialization lat ch is loaded, the following occurs:  \n• The function latch contents are loaded.  \n• An internal pulse resets the R, N (A, B), and t imeout counters \nto load -state conditions and also three -states t he charge \npump. Note that the prescaler band gap reference and the \noscillator input buffer are unaffected by the internal reset pulse, allowing close phase alignment when counting resumes.  \n• Latching the first N ( A, B) counter data after the initialization \nword activate s the same internal reset pulse. Successive N (A, \nB) loads will not trigger the internal reset pulse , unless there \nis another initialization.  \nCE PIN METHOD  \n• Apply V DD. \n• Bring CE low to put the device into power -down. This is an \nasychronous power -down in that it happens immediately.  \n• Program the function l atch (10).  \n• Program the R counter la tch (00).  \n• Program the N ( A, B) counter l atch (01).  \n• Bring CE high to take the device out of power -down. The R \nand N (A, B) counters now resume counting in close \nalignment.  \nNote that after CE goes high, a 1 µs duration may be required \nfor the prescaler band gap voltage and oscillator input buffer bias to reach steady state.  \nCE can be used to power the device up and down to check for \nchannel activity. The input regist er does not need to be \nreprogrammed each time the device is disabled and enabled as \nlong as it is  programmed at least once after V\nDD is initially \napplied.  \nCOUNTER RESET METHOD  \n• Apply V DD. \n• Do a function latch l oad (10 in two LSBs). As part of this, \nload  1 to the F1 bit. This enables the counter reset.  \n• Do an R  counter load (00 in two LSBs).  \n• Do an N ( A, B) counter load (01 in two LSBs).  \n• Do a function latch l oad (10 in two LSBs). As part of this, \nload  0 to the F1 bit. This disables the counter reset.  \nThis seque nce provides the same close alignment as the \ninitialization method. It offers direct control over the internal reset. Note that counter reset holds the counters at load point and three -states the charge pump but does not trigger \nsynchronous power -down.  \n \nRev. F | Page 18 of 24 \nData Sheet ADF4106  \n \nAPPLICATIONS  \nLOCAL OSCILLATOR FOR  LMDS BASE STATION \nTRANSMITTER  \nFigure 22 shows the ADF4106 being used with a VCO to \nproduce the LO for an LMDS base station.  \nThe referenc e input signal is applied to the circuit at FREF IN \nand, in this case, is terminated in 50 Ω. A typical base station \nsystem would have either a TCXO or an OCXO driving the \nreference inp ut without any 50  Ω termination.  \nTo achieve  a channel spacing of 1 MHz at the output, the \n10 MHz reference input must be divided by 10, using the  \non-chip reference divider of the ADF4106. \nThe charge pump output of the ADF4106 (Pin 2) drives the \nloop filt er. In calculating the loop filter component values, a \nnumber of items need to be considered. In this example, the \nloop filter was designed so that the overall phase margin for  \nthe system would be 45°.  \nOther PLL system specifications include : \nKD = 2.5 mA   \nKV = 80 MHz/V  Loop Bandwidth = 50 kHz  \nFPFD = 1 MHz  \nN = 5800  \nExtra Reference Spur Attenuation = 10 dB  \nThese specifications are needed and used to derive the loop \nfilter component values shown in Figure 22. \nThe circuit in  Figure 22 show s a typical phase noise \nperformance of −83 .5 dBc/Hz at 1  kHz offset from the carrier. \nSpurs are better than −62 dBc.  \nThe loop filter output drives the VCO, which in turn is fed  \nback to the RF input of the PLL synt hesizer and also drives the \nRF o utput term inal. A T -circuit configuration provides 50  Ω \nmatching between the VCO output, the RF output, and the RF IN \nterminal of the synthesizer.  \nIn a PLL system, it is important to know when the system  \nis in lock. In Figure 22, this is acc omplished by using the \nMUXOUT signal from the synthesizer. The MUXOUT pin  \ncan be programmed to monitor various internal signals in the \nsynthesizer. One of these is the LD or lock -detect signal.  \n \nADF4106\nCE\nCLK\nDATALE1000pF 1000pF\nREF\nIN\n100pFCP\nMUXOUTCPGND\nAGND\nDGND100pF\n1.5nF20pF100pF\n51Ω6.2kΩ\n4.3kΩ\n100pF18Ω\nNOTE\nDECOUPLING CAPACITORS (0.1 µF/10pF) ON AVDD, DVDD, AND\nVP OF THE ADF4106 AND ON VCC OF THE V956ME03 HAVE\nBEEN OMITTED FROM THE DIAGRAM TO AID CLARITY.SPI®-COMPATIBLE SERIAL BUSRSETRFINA\nRFINBAVDDDVDDVP\nFREFINVDD VP\nLOCK\nDETECTVCC\nV956ME03\n1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8,9, 11, 12, 1318Ω18Ω100pFRF\nOUT\n5.1kΩ7 15 16\n82\n14\n6\n51\n9 4 314\n210\n51Ω\n02720-027 \nFigure 22. Local Oscillator  for LMDS Base Station  \n \nRev. F | Page 19 of 24 \nADF4106  Data Sheet \n \nINTERFACING  \nThe ADF4106 has a simple SPI -compatible serial interface for \nwriting to the device. CLK, DATA, and LE control the data \ntransfer. When LE goes high, the 24 bits clo cked into the input \nregister on each rising edge of CLK are  transferred to the \nappropriate latch. See Figure 2 for the timing diagram and  \nTable 5 for the latch truth table.  \nThe maximum allowable serial clo ck rate is 20  MHz. This \nmeans that the maximum update rate for the device is 833  kHz, \nor one update every 1.2  µs. This is certainly more than adequate \nfor systems that have typical lock times in hundreds of \nmicroseconds.  \nADuC812 Interface  \nFigure 23 shows the interface betwe en the ADF4106 and the \nADuC 812 MicroConverter ®. Since the ADuC812  is based on an \n8051 core, this inte rface can be used with any 8051- based \nmicrocontroller. The MicroConverter  is set up for SPI master \nmod e with CPHA = 0.  To initiate the operation, the I/O port \ndriving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF4106 needs a \n24-bit word. This is accomplished by writing three 8 -bit bytes \nfrom the MicroConverter  to the  device. When the third byte  \nis written , the LE input should be brought high to complete  \nthe transfer.  \nOn first applying power to the ADF4106, it needs four writes \n(one each to the initialization latch, function la tch, R counter \nlatch , and N counter latch) for the output to become active.  \nI/O port lines on the ADuC812  are also used to control  \npower -down (CE input) and to detect lock  (MUXOUT \nconfigured as lock detect and polled by the port input).  \nWhen operating in the mode described, the maximum \nSCLOCK rate of the ADuC812 is 4 MHz. This means that  \nthe maximum rate at which the output frequency can be \nchanged is 166 kHz.  \nCLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)MOSI\nADF4106SCLOCK\nI/O PORTSADuC812\n02720-028 \nFigure 23. ADuC812 -to-ADF4106  Interface  ADSP -2181 Interface  \nFigure 24 shows the interface between the ADF4106 and the \nADSP -21xx digital signal pr ocessor  (DSP).  The ADF4106  \nneeds a 24 -bit serial word for each latch write. The easiest way \nto accomplish this using the ADSP -21xx family is to use the \nautobuffered transmit mode of operation with alternate \nframing. This provides a means for transmitting an entire block \nof serial data before an interrupt is generated. Set up the word \nlength for 8 bits and use three memory locations for each 24 -bit \nword. To program each 24 -bit latch, store the three 8 -bit bytes , \nenable the autobuffered mode, and write to the transmit register \nof the DSP . This last operation initiates the autobuffer transfer.  \nCLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)MOSI\nADF4106SCLOCK\nI/O FLAGSADSP-21xxTFS\n02720-029 \nFigure 24.

The printed \ncircuit board  (PCB)  pad for these should be 0.1 mm longer than \nthe package land length and 0.05 mm wider than the package land width. The land should be centered on the pad. This \nensure s that the solder joint size is maximized. The bottom of \nthe LFCSP has a central thermal p ad. \nThe thermal pad on the PCB  should be at least as large as this \nexposed pad. On the PCB , there should be a clearance of at least \n0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the inner edges of the \npad pattern. This ensure s that shorting is avoided.  \nThermal vias may be used on the PCB  thermal pad to improve \nthermal performance of the package. If vias are used, they \nshould be incorporated in the thermal pad at 1.2 mm pitch grid. \nThe via diameter should be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm , and \nthe via barrel should be pla ted with 1  oz. copper to plug the via.  \nThe user should connect the PCB  thermal pad to AGND.  \n \n \n \n \nRev.
