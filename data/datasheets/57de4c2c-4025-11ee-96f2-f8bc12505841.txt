High power applications\n• Output power ranging between 34.5 - 36.5dBm\n• Efficiency >50% in band of interest\n2. Linear applications\n• RF6886 shows linearity along the lines of a handset powe r amplifier in terms of adjacent channel power (ACP) \nperformance, with the distinct advantage of obtaining AC P compliance at >2x comparative output power. Resultant \noutput power for linear operation will depend on the waveform being considered.\nAll pertinent specifications and performance curves are seen in the tabular and graph sections of the data sheet. The first\nstandard evaluation board has been matche d for 865MHz to 955MHz. Operation with VCC=3.6V  shows output power >36dBm\nand efficiency >50%. For reduced power ranges, efficiency is ma intained, with no change to output match, by lowering VCC. See\ndata for 3.3/3.0V  in the tables provided. The standard evaluation board also demonstrates impressive linearity, shown with\nconventional CDMA modulation. \nThe same data set format is also provided for the 433MHz to 470MHz evaluation board. Nominal data is taken with VCC=3.6V\nand VREG1/2=3.1V. For linear operation, it has been shown that reducing VREG1/2 to 2.7 - 2.8V enhances performance. This\ncan be explained by observing how the co mpression characteristic behaves. Operation with VREG=3.1V shows gradual (soft)\ncompression once power exceeds 31dBm. With VREG reduced to 2.7 - 2.8V, small signal gain drops by 1 - 2dB. Self bias is now\nmore prominent at 31dBm, and gain expansion offsets slow comp ression. The result is flattening of the gain characteristic,\nextending effective compression point out in power. Waveform di stortion is reduced as compared to the VREG=3.1V case, and\nadjacent channel power improves. The sole advantage in using VREG=3.1V would be a slightly higher value for saturated out-put power.\nLow thermal resistance enables reliable high power operation, provided that output load is set to achieve efficiency equal to o r\nbetter than that seen on the RFMD evaluation boards. \nThe maximum rating for output load VSWR on page 2 calls ou t requirement for discussion in this section. RF6886 has shown\nexcellent performance into 50 \uf057, but any system using it as a final amplifier will have to take VSWR variation into account. Test\non properly matched evaluation board has shown that rated ou tput power is obtained with 10dBm at RF input. Practically\nspeaking then, at or near 10dBm would be a maximum reasonab le limit for input power. When considering VSWR variation,\nruggedness is one of the main considerations. Ruggedness here, being the worse case VSWR which can be tolerated for a tran-\nsient period without damage to the device. The following maximum VSWR limits apply:\nV\nCC FreqPOUT into 50\uf057 Load \n(Across Band)Maximum Practical \nInput DriveMaximum Output VSWR \n(Survival)\nVM H z d B m d B m\n3.6 865 to 955 36.2 to 35.2 10 3.5:1\n3.3 35.5 to 34.4 10 5.0:1\n3 34.4 to 33.4 8 5.0:1\n3.6 433 to 470 37 to 36.4 10 3.5:1\n3.3 36.3 to 35.6 10 5.0:1\n3 35.2 to 34.5 8 5.0:1\n6 of 16RF6886\nDS1403037628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570  or sales-support@rfmd.com .In each case, VSWR was tested over phase, with device on/off cycle done several times at phase angle where current was max-\nimum. Test showed that the best off/on sequence for RF6886 is as follows:\nTurn on:\n1. Apply VCC\n2. Apply VREF1/2\n3. Apply drive at RF input\nTurn off:\n1. Remove drive at RF input\n2. Bring down voltage at VREF1/2\n3. Bring down VCC (not necessary in system of course)\nMany systems will use closed loop power co ntrol. When taking output VSWR variation into account, the limits in table above\nstill apply, with same practical maximum limit on RF drive. At some phase angles, higher output powers will not be attainable.\nThus, a limit on maximum drive should be taken into account to prevent overdrive of the device by power control circuit.\nThe VSWR limits set here apply to the most demanding case, wh ere input drive is set for maximum output power. For example,\nPout >36dBm, VCC=3.6V, Pin=10dBm. It is entirely conceivable that the am plifier be used in a linear application at backed off\np o w e r .  I n  t h a t  c a s e ,  i t  f o l l o w s  t h a t  a  h i g h e r  V S W R  c o u l d  b e  t o l e r a t e d .  A s  a n  e x a m p l e ,  c o n s i d e r  3 2 d B m  o u t p u t  p o w e r  w i t h\nVCC=3.6V. Test showed that power control loop would achieve 32d Bm from 865MHz to 955MHz over phase into 5:1 VSWR. The\nincreased VSWR specification as compared to the 3:5: 1 limit in table comes about for the following reason:\nThe harshest condition is encountered at phase angle where 10dBm drive results in forward power >38.5dBm and current >\n>3000mA. A power control loop sensing forward (coupled) power wo uld back input drive down in this case and prevent dam-\nage. That provided it reacts quickly enough. The more limiting factor in this case, phase angle for lowest power presents a sit u-\nation where target power cannot be achieved. That even if drive is allowed to go beyond practical maximum. But because the\namplifier was seen to achieve 32dBm over phase along with ruggedness, the increased VSWR specification becomes reason-\nable in the presence of power control and lower output power requirement. So, a multitude of scenarios could exist, with testbeing required to determine allowable VSWR specification.\nPower control can be implemented via se veral different methodologies, using ci rcuitry external to RF6886. One method\nalready touched upon, sampling forward coupled output power and feedback to adjust at one of two points in the system:\n1. With constant drive level at RF6886 input, adjust voltage level at V\nREG1  and/or VREG2 . VREG1/2 can be tied together, \nor one of the two can be kept constant with the other adjusted.\n2. With VREF1/2  constant, RF drive at device input can be adjust ed via feedback to a system control point behind\nRF6886.\nTwo RF6886 output pins are also  available for use in a power control scheme, PWR SENSE (pin 23) and PWR REF (pin 24).\nViewing the evaluation board schematics, it ca n be seen that both pins are tied to VCC through 390 \uf057 resistors. Both pins sink\ncurrent, resulting in following voltages at respective board connectors:\nV_PWR REF = VCC - 390*I_PWR_REF\nV_PWR SENSE = VCC - 390*I_PWR_SENSE\n7 of 16RF6886\nDS1403037628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570  or sales-support@rfmd.com .V_PWR_REF output pin yields a voltage proportional to DC co mponent of total output stage drive current, while V_PWR_SENSE\noutput pin does likewise for DC + RF components. Subtraction between these voltages gives result proportional to RF current\nonly, and therefore output power as well. Graphs of Log 10  (V_PWR REF - V_PWR SENSE) vs. RF6886 power out are shown for\ntwo scenarios:\n1. RF drive at device input = constant 10dBm, with ramp at VREG1/2 .\n2. VREG1/2  = constant 3.1V, with RF drive ramp from 0 - 10dBm.\nIn both cases, it can be seen that output power versus Log of this difference maintains a linear relationship up to 33.5dBm.\nNon-linear behavior past 33.5dBm  is caused by 2 contributors:\n1. Compression beginning to take ef fect at RF6886 1st and/or 2nd stage.\n2. PWR_REF and PWR_SENSE transistor collector voltage redu ction and associated compression. Note that changing \n390\uf057 value will influence curve shape and shift graphs up/down on y-axis.\nAs an additional exercise to investigate #2 above, like graphs are shown for 180 \uf057 pull up resistor vs. 390 \uf057. With 180 \uf057 in\nplace, internal PWR_REF and PWR_SENSE transistors retain higher collector voltage, and do not enter into compression. As ar e s u l t ,  w e  s e e  a l t e r e d  c u r v e s  a s  c o m p a r e d  t o  3 9 0 \uf057 case. Log (V_PWR_REF - V_PWR_SE NSE) continue to increase, with\nincreasing slope, vs. output power. One other in teresting data point, the curve for ramp at V\nREG1/2  now closely resembles that\nfor ramp at RF input.\nThe curves will remain consistent for a given frequency and temperature provided the following remain constant:\n1. REF/SENSE resistance (Does not change va lue in design. This only noted for clarity)\n2. Output load VSWR\nPractically speaking then, this method of fers a relatively simple approach, with presumably less accuracy as compared to\nclosed loop control which couples forward power at output. In the coupled power method, VSWR variation will of course also\nimpact accuracy.\nHere are general schematics for approa ches utilizing PWR_REF/PWR_SENSE pins in described power control schemes:\nApproach 1:\n\n8 of 16RF6886\nDS1403037628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570  or sales-support@rfmd.com .Approach 2:\nApproach #1 feeds back to variable gain stage behind RF6886. Approach #2 utilizes feedback to VREG1/2  pins of RF6886.\nRecall Log of the Loop Reference Voltage is shown in graphs for both methods. In the circuits shown above, no Log function is\nperformed. Data for V_delta = (V_PWR_REF - V_PWR_SENSE) vs. Output Power out is collected, and Loop Reference Voltage is\nset to V_delta(s) for corresponding Output Power(s). Data ca n be collected at selected frequency and temperature points,\ndepending on accuracy desired in a particular application.\nNext, a discussion covering RF6886 used in balanced  configuration. The application as depicted here:\nThis configuration can be implemented with readily available surface mount hybrid couplers, and offers significant perfor-\nmance and reliability advantages . Use single ended RF6886 3.6V specifications for reference:\n1. >38.5dBm output power\n2. Linear performance with 2.5dB increase in power for equivalent adjacent channel power specification3. Immunity to antenna VSWR variation\n\n9 of 16RF6886\nDS1403037628 Thorndike Road, Greensboro, NC  27409-9421 · For sales or technical \nsupport, contact RFMD at (+1) 336-678-5570  or sales-support@rfmd.com .One key consideration will be output side isolated port 50 \uf057 termination resistance. In the case where output VSWR deviates\nsignificantly from 50 \uf057, reflected power will be absorbed in the isolated port. This will require placement of resistor bank capa-\nble of handling power dissipation while fault condition exists. \nFinally, consider the maximum allowable operating device voltage, listed at 4.0V in the table on page 2. Operating with\nVCC=4.0 V enables higher compression point, which becomes attractive in two types of applications:\n1. High power, high efficiency\n2. Linear, requiring specification compliance at higher power level \nViewing curves in the graph section, it can be seen that devi ce junction temperature stays below 150°C (85°C ambient) up to\nrated power levels. Junction temperature becomes a more critical  specification with higher operating voltage. It should be\nstressed again here that a properly matched output load impedance is required to provide high efficiency. Load impedance\nhas been measured on both standard evaluation  boards. The table below contains that data:\nIn any application where greater than 3.6V operation is bein g considered, use of an isolator at RF6886 output is recom-\nmended. This, of course, excludes the ba lanced configuration already discussed. The recommendation would also hold for\nVCC\uf0a33.6V, in cases where potential output VSWR conditions exceed those outlined previously in this section.
