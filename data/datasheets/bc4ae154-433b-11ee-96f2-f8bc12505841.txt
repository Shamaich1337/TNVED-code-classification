Based on the Analog Devices, Inc., iCoupler® \ntechnology, the dc-to-dc converter provides up to 500 mW of \nregulated, isolated power at either  5.0 V or 3.3 V from a 5.0 V input \nsupply, or at 3.3 V from a 3.3 V supply at the power levels shown in Table 1. These devices eliminate th e need for a separate, isolated \ndc-to-dc converter in low power, isolated designs. The iCoupler \nchip scale transformer technology is used to isolate the logic \nsignals and for the power and feedback paths in the dc-to-dc \nconverter. The result is a sma ll form factor, total isolation \nsolution. The ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 isolators \nprovide four independent isolation channels in a variety of \nchannel configurations and data rates (see the Ordering Guide \nfor more information). \nisoPower uses high frequency switching elements to transfer \npower through its transformer. Special care must be taken \nduring printed circuit board (PCB) layout to meet emissions standards. See the AN-0971 Application Note  for board layout \nrecommendations.

E | Page 20 of 29 TERMINOLOGY \nIDD1 (Q)  \nIDD1 (Q)  is the minimum operating current drawn at the V DD1  \npin when there is no external load at V ISO and the I/O pins are \noperating below 2 Mbps, requiring no additional dynamic supply \ncurrent. I DD1 (Q)  reflects the minimum current operating \ncondition. \nIDD1 (D)  \nIDD1 (D)  is the typical input supply current with all channels \nsimultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps  \nwith full capacitive load representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Resistive load s on the outputs should be  \ntreated separately from the dynamic load. \nI\nDD1 (MAX)  \nIDD1 (MAX)  is the input current under full dynamic and V ISO load \nconditions. I\nSO (LOAD)  \nISO (LOAD)  is the current available to the load. \ntPHL Propagation Delay \nThe t PHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of \nthe falling edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the falling \nedge of the V Ox signal. tPLH Propagation Delay \ntPLH propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the \nrising edge of the V Ix signal to the 50% level of the rising edge  \nof the V Ox signal. \nPropagation Delay Skew, t PSK \ntPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in t PHL and/or \ntPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temper-\nature, supply voltages, and output load within the recommended \noperating conditions. \nChannel-to-Channel Matching, (t PSKCD /tPSKOD ) \nChannel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the \ndifference in propagation delays between two channels when \noperated with identical loads. \nMinimum Pulse Width \nThe minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed. \nMaximum Data Rate \nThe maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed. \n \n \nData Sheet ADuM5401/ADuM5402/ADuM5403/ADuM5404\n \nRev. E | Page 21 of 29 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe dc-to-dc converter section of the ADuM5401 /ADuM5402 / \nADuM5403/ ADuM5404 works on principles that are common to \nmost switching power supplies. It has a secondary side controller \narchitecture with isolated pulse-width modulation (PWM) feedback. V\nDD1 power is supplied to an oscillating circuit that \nswitches current into a chip sc ale air core transformer. Power \ntransferred to the secondary side is rectified and regulated to either 3.3 V or 5 V. The secondary (V\nISO) side controller regulates \nthe output by creating a PWM cont rol signal that is sent to the \nprimary (V DD1) side by a dedicated iCoupler data channel. The \nPWM modulates the oscillator circuit to control the power being sent to the secondary side. Feedback  allows for significantly higher \npower and efficiency. \nThe ADuM5401 /ADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 implement \nundervoltage lockout (UVLO) with hysteresis on the V\nDD1 power \ninput. This feature ensures that the converter does not enter \noscillation due to noisy input power or slow power-on ramp rates. \nPCB LAYOUT \nThe ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 digital \nisolators with 0.5 W isoPower integrated dc-to-dc converter \nrequire no external interface ci rcuitry for the logic interfaces. \nPower supply bypassing is requir ed at the input and output \nsupply pins (see Figure 25). Note that low ESR bypass capacitors are required between Pin 1 and Pin 2 and between Pin 15 and Pin 16, as close to the chip pads as possible. \nThe power supply section of the ADuM5401 /ADuM5402/ \nADuM5403/ ADuM5404 uses a 180 MHz oscillator frequency \nto pass power efficiently through its chip scale transformers. In \naddition, the normal operation of the data section of the iCoupler \nintroduces switching transients on the power supply pins. Bypass \ncapacitors are required for several operating frequencies. Noise \nsuppression requires a low inductance, high frequency capacitor; ripple suppression and proper regulation require a large value capacitor. These are most conveniently connected between Pin 1 \nand Pin 2 for V\nDD1 and between Pin 15 and Pin 16 for V ISO.  \nThe ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 are \noptimized to run with an output capacitance of 10 μF to 33 μF. \nHigher total load capacitance is  not recommended. To suppress \nnoise and reduce ripple, a parallel combination of at least two capacitors is required. The recommended value for the smaller capacitor is 0.1 μF with low ESR. For example, the use of a \nceramic capacitor is ad vised. The larger capacitor can be of a \nlower frequency type and accounts for the remaining \ncapacitance required to control ripple. \nThe total lead length between the ends of the low ESR capacitor \nand the input power supply pin must not exceed 2 mm. Installing the bypass capacitor with traces more than 2 mm in length may result in data corruption. Consider bypassing between Pin 1 and \nPin 8 and between Pin 9 and Pin 16 unless both common ground \npins are connected close to the package.

Recommended PCB Layout \nIn applications involving high common-mode transients, ensure that board coupling across the is olation barrier is minimized. \nFurthermore, design the board layout such that any coupling that does occur affects all pins equally on a given component side. Failure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between pins exceeding the absolute maximum ratings for the device  as specified in Table 19, thereby leading to latch-up and/or \npermanent damage. \nThe ADuM5401 /ADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 are power \ndevices that dissipate approximately 1 W of power when fully \nloaded and running at maximum speed. Because it is not possible to apply a heat sink to an isolation device, the devices primarily depend on heat dissipation into the PCB through the GND pins. If the devices are used at high ambient temperatures, provide \na thermal path from the GND pins to the PCB ground plane. The board layout in Figure 25 sh ows enlarged pads for Pin 8 and \nPin 9. Large diameter vias should be implemented from the pad to the ground, and power planes should be used to reduce inductance. Multiple vias should be implemented from the pad \nto the ground plane to significantly reduce the temperature \ninside the chip. The dimensions of the expanded pads are at the discretion of the designer and depend on the available board space. \nTHERMAL ANALYSIS \nThe ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 devices \nconsist of four internal die attach ed to a split lead frame with two \ndie attach paddles. For the purposes of thermal analysis, the die is treated as a thermal unit, with the highest junction temperature \nreflected in the θ\nJA from Table 14. The value of θ JA is based on \nmeasurements taken with the devices mounted on a JEDEC \nstandard, 4-layer board with fine width traces and still air. Under normal operating conditions, the ADuM5401 /ADuM5402 / \nADuM5403/ ADuM5404 devices operate at full load across the \nfull temperature range without derating the output current. \nHowever, following the recommendations in the PCB Layout section decreases thermal resistance to the PCB, allowing increased thermal margins in high ambient temperatures. \n   \nADuM5401/ADuM5402/AD uM5403/ADuM5404 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 22 of 29 PROPAGATION DELAY-RELATED PARAMETERS \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it takes \na logic signal to propagate through a component (see Figure 26). The propagation delay to a logic low output may differ from the \npropagation delay to a logic high. \nINPUT ( VIx)\nOUTPUT (VOx)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n06577-018 \nFigure 26. Propagation Delay Parameters \nPulse width distortion is th e maximum difference between \nthese two propagation delay values and is an indication of  how accurately the input signal timing is preserved.  \nChannel-to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthe propagation delay differs between channels within a single \nADuM5401/ ADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 component. \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount the propagation delay differs between multiple ADuM5401/ \nADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 components operating \nunder the same conditions. \nSTART-UP BEHAVIOR \nThe ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 do not \ncontain a soft start circuit. Therefore, the start-up current and \nvoltage behavior must be taken into account when designing with this device. \nWhen power is applied to V\nDD1, the input switching circuit begins \nto operate and draw current wh en the UVLO minimum voltage \nis reached. The switching circuit drives the maximum available \npower to the output until it reaches the regulation voltage where PWM control begins. The amount of current and the time required to reach regulati on voltage depends on the load \nand the V\nDD1 slew rate. \nWith a fast V DD1 slew rate (200 μs or less), the peak current draws \nup to 100 mA/V of V DD1. The input voltage goes high faster \nthan the output can turn on, so the peak current is proportional to the maximum input voltage. \nWith a slow V\nDD1 slew rate (in the millisecond range), the input \nvoltage is not changing quickly when V DD1 reaches the UVLO \nminimum voltage. The current surge is approximately 300 mA \nbecause V DD1 is nearly constant at the 2.7 V UVLO voltage. The \nbehavior during startup is simila r to when the device load is a \nshort circuit; these values are consistent with the short-circuit current shown in Figure 14. \nWhen starting the device for V\nISO = 5 V operation, do not limit \nthe current available to the V DD1 power pin to less than 300 mA. \nThe ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 devices \nmay not be able to drive the outp ut to the regulation point if a \ncurrent-limiting device clamps the V DD1 voltage during startup. \n As a result, the ADuM5401/ ADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404  \ndevices can draw large amounts of current at low voltage for \nextended periods of time. \nThe output voltage of the ADuM5401 /ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ \nADuM5404 devices exhibits V ISO overshoot during startup. If \nthis overshoot could potentially damage components attached \nto V ISO, a voltage-limiting device such as a Zener diode can be \nused to clamp the voltage. Typica l behavior is shown in Figure 19 \nand Figure 20. \nPowering up V DD1 with V ISO under bias is not recommended \nand may result in improper regu lation. In a practical design, \ntake care to avoid the existence of a parasitic path that applies \nvoltage to V ISO before V DD1. \nEMI CONSIDERATIONS \nThe dc-to-dc converter section of the ADuM5401 /ADuM5402 / \nADuM5403/ ADuM5404 devices must operate at 180 MHz to \nallow efficient power transfer through the small transformers. \nThis creates high frequency currents that can propagate in circuit board ground and power planes, causing edge emissions and dipole radiation between the primary and secondary ground planes. Grounded enclosures are recommended for \napplications that use these devices. If grounded enclosures are \nnot possible, follow good RF design practices in the layout of the PCB. See the AN-0971 Application Note  for board layout \nrecommendations \nDC CORRECTNESS AND MAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause narrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the transformer. The decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the \nabsence of logic transitions at the input for more than 1 μs, a \nperiodic set of refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state is sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses for more than approximately 5 μs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, and the \nisolator output is forced to a default low state by the watchdog \ntimer circuit. This situation should occur in the ADuM5401 / \nADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 during power-up and \npower-down operations. \nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the \nADuM5401/ ADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 is set by the \ncondition in which induced voltage in the receiving coil of the \ntransformer is sufficiently large to either falsely set or reset the \ndecoder. The following analysis defines the conditions under which this may occur. The 3.3 V operating condition of the ADuM5401/ ADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 is examined \nbecause it represents the most susceptible mode of operation. \n    \nData Sheet ADuM5401/ADuM5402/ADuM5403/ADuM5404\n \nRev. E | Page 23 of 29 The pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0 V. The decoder has a se nsing threshold at approximately \n0.5 V, thus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages \ncan be tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is \ngiven by \nV = (−dβ/dt )∑πrn2; n = 1, 2, … , N \nwhere: \nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nN is the total number of turns in the receiving coil. \n \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM5401/ \nADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404, and an imposed \nrequirement that the induced voltage be, at most, 50% of the \n0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic field is calculated as shown in Figure 27. \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n06577-019 \nFigure 27. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum \nallowable magnetic field of 0.2 kg auss induces a voltage of 0.25 V \nat the receiving coil. This voltage is approximately 50% of the \nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse (and is of the worst-case polarity), it reduces the received pulse from >1.0 V to 0.75 V, still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold \nof the decoder. \nThe preceding magnetic flux densit y values correspond to specific \ncurrent magnitudes at given distances from the ADuM5401 / \nADuM5402/ ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 transformers. Figure 28 \nexpresses these allowable current magnitudes as a function of \nfrequency for selected distances.  As shown in Figure 28, the \nADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403 /ADuM5404 are extremely \nimmune and can be affected on ly by extremely large currents \noperated at high frequency very close to the component. For the 1 MHz example, a 0.5 kA current placed 5 mm away from the ADuM5401 /ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 is \nrequired to affect the operation of the device.

Exercise care in the layout of such traces to avoid this possibility. \nPOWER CONSUMPTION \nThe V DD1 power supply input provides power to the iCoupler \ndata channels, as well as to the power converter. For this reason, the quiescent currents drawn by the data converter and the primary and secondary input/output channels cannot be determined separately. All of th ese quiescent power demands have \nbeen combined into the I\nDD1 (Q)  current, as shown in Figure 29. The \ntotal I DD1 supply current is the sum of the quiescent operating \ncurrent; the dynamic current, I DD1 (D) , demanded by the I/O \nchannels; and any external I ISO load. \nCONVERTER\nPRIMARYCONVERTER\nSECONDARY\nPRIMARY\nDATA\nINPUT/OUTPUT\n4-CHANNELIDDP(D)\nSECONDARY\nDATA\nINPUT/OUTPUT\n4-CHANNELIISO(D)IISO IDD1(Q)\nIDD1(D)\n06577-024 \nFigure 29.

E | Page 24 of 29 Both dynamic input and output current is consumed only  \nwhen operating at channel speeds higher than the refresh rate, f\nr. Each channel has a dynamic current determined by its data \nrate. Figure 21 shows the current  for a channel in the forward \ndirection, which means that the input is on the primary side of the device. Figure 22 shows the current for a channel in the reverse direction, which means that the input is on the secondary side of the device. Both figures assume a typical 15 pF load. The following \nrelationship allows the total I\nDD1 current to be calculated: \nIDD1 = (IISO × VISO)/(E × VDD1) + Σ I CHn; n = 1 to 4 (1) \nwhere: \nIDD1 is the total supply input current. \nICHn is the current drawn by a single channel determined from \nFigure 21 or Figure 22, depe nding on channel direction. \nIISO is the current drawn by the secondary side external load. \nE is the power supply efficiency at 100 mA load from Figure 11 \nat the V ISO and V DD1 condition of interest. \nThe maximum external load can be calculated by subtracting \nthe dynamic output load from  the maximum allowable load. \nIISO (LOAD)  = IISO (MAX)  − Σ IISO (D)n ; n = 1 to 4 (2) \nwhere:  \nIISO (LOAD)  is the current available to supply an external secondary \nside load.  \nIISO (MAX)  is the maximum external secondary side load current \navailable at V ISO. \nIISO (D)n  is the dynamic load current drawn from V ISO by an input \nor output channel, as shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24. \nThe preceding analysis assumes a 15 pF capacitive load on each \ndata output. If the capacitive load is larger than 15 pF, the \nadditional current must be in cluded in the analysis of I DD1 and \nIISO (LOAD) . \nPOWER CONSIDERATIONS \nThe ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 power \ninput, data input channels on the primary side, and data channels \non the secondary side are all protected from premature operation \nby undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuitry. Below the minimum operating voltage, the power converter holds its oscillator inactive and all input channel drivers and refresh circuits are idle. Outputs remain in a high impedance state to prevent transmission of undefined states during power-up and \npower-down operations. \nDuring application of power to V\nDD1, the primary side circuitry \nis held idle until the UVLO preset voltage is reached. At that \ntime, the data channels initialize to their default low output state until they receive data pulses from the secondary side. \nWhen the primary side is above the UVLO threshold, the data \ninput channels sample their inputs and begin sending encoded pulses to the inactive secondary output channels. The outputs on the primary side remain in their default low state because no \ndata comes from the secondary side inputs until secondary side power is established. The primary side oscillator also begins to \noperate, transferring power to the secondary power circuits. \nThe secondary V\nISO voltage is below its UVLO limit at this \npoint; the regulation control signal from the secondary side  \nis not being generated. The primary side power oscillator is allowed to free run under these conditions, supplying the \nmaximum amount of power to the secondary side.  \nAs the secondary side voltage rises to its regulation setpoint,  \na large inrush current transient is present at V\nDD1. When the \nregulation point is reached, the regulation control circuit produces \nthe regulation control signal that modulates the oscillator on the primary side. The V\nDD1 current is then reduced and is \nproportional to the load current. The inrush current is less than \nthe short-circuit current shown in  Figure 14. The duration of \nthe inrush current depends on the V ISO loading conditions and \non the current and voltage available at the V DD1 pin. \nAs the secondary side converter be gins to accept power from the \nprimary, the V ISO voltage starts to rise. When the secondary side \nUVLO is reached, the secondary side outputs are initialized to \ntheir default low state until data is received from the corresponding \nprimary side input. It can take up to 1 μs after the secondary side \nis initialized for the state of the output to correlate to the primary side input. \nSecondary side inputs sample their state and transmit it to the \nprimary side. Outputs are valid about 1 μs after the secondary side becomes active. \nBecause the rate of charge of the secondary side power supply is \ndependent on loading conditions, the input voltage, and the output voltage level selected, take care that the design allows the converter \nsufficient time to stabilize before valid data is required. \nWhen power is removed from V\nDD1, the primary side converter \nand coupler shut down when the UVLO level is reached. The \nsecondary side stops receiving po wer and starts to discharge. \nThe outputs on the secondary side hold the last state that they \nreceived from the primary side. Either the UVLO level is reached and the outputs are placed in thei r high impedance state, or the \noutputs detect a lack of activity from the primary side inputs and the outputs are set to their default low value before the secondary \npower reaches UVLO. \nINCREASING AVAILABLE POWER \nThe ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 /ADuM5403/ ADuM5404 are \ndesigned with the capability of running in combination with \nother compatible iso Power devices.

E | Page 26 of 29 INSULATION LIFETIME \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected to \nvoltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insulation degradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage waveform applied across the insulation. In addition to the testing \nperformed by the regulatory ag encies, Analog Devices carries \nout an extensive set of evaluations to determine the lifetime  \nof the insulation structure within the ADuM5401/ ADuM5402 / \nADuM5403/ ADuM5404 devices. \nAnalog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage levels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. \nAcceleration factors for several operating conditions are determined. These factors allow calculation of the time to failure \nat the actual working voltage. The values shown in Table 20 \nsummarize the peak voltage for 50 years of service life for a bipolar ac operating condition and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working voltages. In  many cases, the approved \nworking voltage is higher than the  \n50-year service life voltage. Operation at these high working \nvoltages can lead to shortened insulation life in some cases. \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM5401/ ADuM5402/ \nADuM5403/ ADuM5404 devices depends on the voltage wave-\nform type imposed across the isolation barrier. The iCoupler \ninsulation structure degrades at different rates depending on \nwhether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 30, Figure 31, and Figure 32 illustrate these different isolation voltage waveforms. \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. The goal \nof a 50-year operating lifetime under the bipolar ac condition \ndetermines the maximum working voltage recommended by \nAnalog Devices. \n  \n \n  In the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insulation \nis significantly lower. This allows operation at higher working voltages while still achieving a 50-year service life. The working voltages listed in Table 20 can be applied while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime, provided that the voltage conforms \nto either the unipolar ac or dc voltage cases. \nAny cross-insulation voltage waveform that does not conform \nto Figure 31 or Figure 32 should be treated as a bipolar ac wave-\nform and its peak voltage limited to the 50-year lifetime voltage value listed in Table 20. \nThe voltage presented in Figure 32 is shown as sinusoidal for \nillustration purposes only. It is meant to represent any voltage waveform varying between 0 V and some limiting value. The \nlimiting value can be positive or negative, but the voltage \ncannot cross 0 V. \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n06577-021 \nFigure 30.
