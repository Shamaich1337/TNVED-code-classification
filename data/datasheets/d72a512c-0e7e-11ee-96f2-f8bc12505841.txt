The device is similar to the LTC5553, but with a broadband, differential DC to 6GHz IF port. The LTC5552 is recommended for applica -\ntions where the IF frequency range extends below 50\n 0MHz. \nFor applications where the IF frequency is always above 500MHz, the LTC5553 is recommended, since it includes an integrated IF balun.\nThe mixer and integrated RF balun are optimized to cover \nthe 3GHz to 20GHz RF frequency range. The integrated LO amplifier is optimized for the 1GHz to 20GHz frequency range, requiring only 0dBm drive.\nThe part delivers high IIP3 and P1dB, low LO leakage and \nhigh integration in a small package.\nElectrostatic Sensitive Device\nObserve Handling Precautions\n  \nESD Sensitivity:   \n HBM = Class 0 on Pin 11   \n  Class 1C All Other Pins   \n CDM = 500V All Pins\nConversion Loss and IIP3 vs RF Frequency\n(Low Side LO, IF = 240MHz)APPLICATIONS nIntegrated LO Buffer: 0dBm LO Drive\n n50Ω Wideband Matched RF and LO Ports\n nWide IF Bandwidth: DC to 6GHz\n nUpconversion or Downconversion\n nHigh IIP3:\n n+22.5dBm at 10GHz\n n+18.3dBm at 17GHz\n n+14.6dBm Input P1dB at 10GHz\n n8dB Conversion Loss at 10GHz \n n3.3V/132mA Supply\n nFast Turn ON/OFF for TDD Operation\n n3mm × 2mm, 12-Lead QFN Package\n n5G Broadband Wireless Access\n nMicrowave T ransceivers\n nWireless Backhaul\n nPoint-to-Point Microwave\n nPhased-Array Antennas\n nC, X and Ku Band RADAR\n nTest Equipment\n nSatellite Modems\nDUPLEXERLNA\nPAL TC5552\nRX\nIFOUT\nTX\nIFINRX\nLO\nTX\nLOLORF IF\nL TC5552LO\nRF IF\n5552 TA01a\nIIP3\nCONVERSION LOSS\nDOWNMIXING\nUPMIXING\nRF FREQUENCY (GHz)\n3\n5\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n17\n19\n21\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n17\n19\n21\n23\n25\nCONVERSION LOSS (dB), IIP3 (dBm)\n5552 TA01bL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of \nAnalog\xa0Devices, Inc.

See the Block Diagram section for a description of each pin function. The RF and LO are single-ended 50Ω ports. The IF is differential. An external balun is needed if a single-ended IF signal is desired. The LTC5552 can be used as a frequency downconverter where the RF is used as an input and IF is used as an output. It can also be used as a frequency upconverter where the IF is used as an input and RF is used as an output. Low side or high side LO injection can be used. The evaluation circuit and the evalu -\nation board layout are shown in Figure\xa01 and Figure\xa02,  \nrespectively. \nFigure\xa02. Evaluation Board Layout\nFigure\xa03. Simplified RF Port Interface Schematic(b) With Shunt 0.15pF at 1.4mm(a) No Matching\nRF Port\nThe mixer’s RF port, shown in Figure\xa03, is connected to the \nprimary winding of an integrated transformer . The primary side of the RF transformer is DC–grounded internally and \nL TC5552\nRF\n5552 F035RF\n50/uni03A9\nZO = 50/uni03A9\nL = 1.4mmthe DC resistance of the primary side is approximately 2.5Ω. A DC blocking capacitor is needed if the RF source has DC voltage present. The secondary winding of the RF transformer is internally connected to the mixer core.\nThe RF port is internally broadband matched from 3GHz to \n20GHz. A 0.15pF shunt capacitor located 1.4mm away from the RF pin can be used to improve the RF port matching between 13GHz to 15GHz. LO power between –6dBm and 6dBm is required for good RF impedance matching. The measured RF input return loss is shown in Figure\xa04 for IF frequencies of 900MHz, 2GHz and 4GHz with low side LO. \nFigure\xa04.

The LO amplifier is optimized for the 1GHz to 20GHz LO frequency range. LO frequencies above or below this frequency range may be used with degraded performance.\nThe DC voltage at the LO input is about 1.6V. A DC block -\ning capacitor (C1) is required. Figure\xa05.

To ensure the best LO imped -\nance matching over the very wide bandwidth, no ESD protection devices are used at the LO input. As a result, the LO is the most sensitive pin to ESD stress for the mixer . The measured LO input return loss is shown in Figure\xa0\n6. \nThe nominal LO input level is 0dBm, although the limiting amplifiers will deliver excellent performance over a ± 6dBm  \ninput power range.\nFigure\xa06.

To enable the chip, the EN voltage must be higher than 1.2V. The voltage at the EN pin should never exceed V\nCC by more than 0.3V. If this should occur , the \nsupply current could be sourced through the ESD diode, potentially damaging the IC. If the EN pin is left floating, its voltage will be pulled low by the internal pull-down resistor and the chip will be disabled.\nTC1–1–13M+\nTCM1–83X+\nIF FREQUENCY (GHz)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nRETURN LOSS  (dB)\n5552 F08\nLTC555215\n5552f For more information www.linear .com/L TC5552APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSupply Voltage Ramping\nFast ramping of the supply voltage can cause a current \nglitch in the internal ESD protection circuits.
