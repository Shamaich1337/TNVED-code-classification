Either primary- or secondary-side regulation may be used to implement isolated ornonisolated power supplies. These devices are current-mode controllers with an integrated high-voltage start-up circuit suitable for telecom/industrial voltage rangepower supplies. Current-mode control with leading-edge blanking simplifies control-loop design and inter-nal ramp compensation circuitry stabilizes the currentloop when operating at duty cycles above 50%(MAX5019). The MAX5019 allows 85% operating dutycycle and can be used to implement flyback converterswhereas the MAX5020 limits the operating duty cycle toless than 50% and can be used in single-ended for-ward converters. A high-voltage startup circuit allowsthese devices to draw power directly from the 18V to110V input supply during startup. The switching fre-quency is internally trimmed to 275kHz ±10%, thusreducing magnetics and filter component costs.\nThe MAX5019/MAX5020 are available in 8-pin SO\npackages.\nWarning: The MAX5019/MAX5020 operate with high\nvoltages.

Current-mode operation simplifies control-loopdesign while enhancing loop stability. An internal high-voltage startup regulator allows the device to connectdirectly to the input supply without an external startupresistor. Current from the internal regulator starts thecontroller. Once the tertiary winding voltage is estab-lished the internal regulator is switched off and biascurrent for running the IC is derived from the tertiarywinding. The internal oscillator is set to 275kHz andtrimmed to ±10%. This permits the use of small mag-netic components to minimize board space. Both theMAX5019 and MAX5020 can be used in power sup-plies providing multiple output voltages. A functionaldiagram of the IC is shown in Figure 1. Typical applica-tions circuits for forward and flyback topologies areshown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. For isolat-ed flyback power supplies use the circuit of Figure 4.\nCurrent-Mode Control\nThe MAX5019/MAX5020 offer current-mode controloperation with added features such as leading-edgeblanking with dual internal path that only blanks thesensed current signal applied to the input of the PWM\ncomparator. The current limit comparator monitors theCS pin at all times and provides cycle-by-cycle currentlimit without being blanked. The leading-edge blankingof the CS signal prevents the PWM comparator fromprematurely terminating the on cycle. The CS signalcontains a leading-edge spike that is the result of theMOSFET gate charge current, capacitive and diodereverse recovery current of the power circuit. Since thisleading-edge spike is normally lower than the currentlimit comparator threshold, current limiting is notblanked and cycle-by-cycle current limiting is providedunder all conditions.\nUse the MAX5019 in discontinuous flyback applications\nwhere wide line voltage and load current variation isexpected. Use the MAX5020 for single transistor for-ward converters where the maximum duty cycle mustbe limited to less than 50%.\nUnder certain conditions it may be advantageous to\nuse a forward converter with greater than 50% dutycycle. For those cases use the MAX5019. The largeduty cycle results in much lower operating primaryRMS currents through the MOSFET switch and in mostcases a smaller output filter inductor.

For supply voltages less than 36V, V DD\nand V+ can both be connected to the supply. For supply voltages greater than 36V, V DD receives\nits power from the tertiary winding of the transformer and accepts voltages from 13V to 36V.

Functional Diagram\nMAX5019/MAX5020\nvantage to this is that the MOSFET voltage rating must\nbe higher and that slope compensation must be provid-ed to stabilize the inner current loop. The MAX5019provides internal slope compensation.\nInternal Regulators\nThe internal regulators of the MAX5019/MAX5020enable initial startup without a lossy startup resistor andregulate the voltage at the output of a tertiary (bias)winding to provide power for the IC. At startup V+ isregulated down to V\nCCto provide bias for the device.\nThe V DDregulator then regulates from the output of the\ntertiary winding to V CC. This architecture allows the ter-\ntiary winding to only have a small filter capacitor at itsoutput thus eliminating the additional cost of a filterinductor. \nWhen designing the tertiary winding calculate the num-\nber of turns so the minimum reflected voltage is alwayshigher than 12.7V. The maximum reflected voltagemust be less than 36V.\nTo reduce power dissipation the high-voltage regulator\nis disabled when the V\nDDvoltage reaches 12.7V. This\ngreatly reduces power dissipation and improves effi-ciency. If V\nCCfalls below the undervoltage lockout\nthreshold (V CC= 6.6V), the low-voltage regulator is dis-abled, and soft-start is reinitiated. In undervoltage lock-\nout the MOSFET driver output (NDRV) is held low.\nIf the input voltage range is between 13V and 36V, V+\nand V DDmay be connected to the line voltage provid-\ned that the maximum power dissipation is not exceed-ed. This eliminates the need for a tertiary winding.\nUndervoltage Lockout (UVLO), Soft-Start,\nand Shutdown\nThe soft-start feature of the MAX5019/MAX5020 allows\nthe load voltage to ramp up in a controlled manner,thus eliminating output voltage overshoot.\nWhile the part is in UVLO, the capacitor connected to\nthe SS_ SHDN pin is discharged. Upon coming out of\nUVLO an internal current source starts charging thecapacitor to initiate the soft-start cycle. Use the follow-ing equation to calculate total soft-start time:\nwhere C\nSSis the soft-start capacitor as shown in Figure 2.\nOperation begins when V SS_SHDN ramps above 0.6V.\nWhen soft-start has completed, V SS_SHDN is regulatedtmsCstartup ss =×04 5.nFCurrent-Mode PWM Controllers with Integrated\nStartup Circuit\n8 _______________________________________________________________________________________NDRVVOUT\n5V/10A\nCOUT\n3 ✕\n560µFCDD\n4.7µF\nCCC\n10µF\nCSS\n0.1µF0.1µFVDD\nRSENSE\n100m ΩR1\n2kΩ\nR2\n2kΩ100Ω20Ω\nM1\nIRF640NVIN\n(36V TO 72V)NT NR\nNP NSCIN\nVCC\nCS\nGND3 ✕\n0.47µFL1\n4.7µH\nFBMAX5020V+\n1nF6\nCMHD20031N4148\n14SBL204OCT\n(OPTIONAL)CFBSS_SHDN14 5\nFigure 2.

The gain of the error amplifier is inter-nally configured for -20 (see Figure 1).\nThe error amplifier may also be used to regulate the out-\nput of the tertiary winding for implementing a primary-side regulated isolated power supply (see Figure 4).Calculate the output voltage using the following equation:\nwhere N\nSis the number of secondary turns and N Tis\nthe number of tertiary winding turns.\nPWM Comparator and Slope Compensation\nAn internal 275kHz oscillator determines the switchingfrequency of the controller. At the beginning of eachcycle, NDRV switches the N-channel MOSFET on.NDRV switches the external MOSFET off after the maxi-mum duty cycle has been reached, regardless of thefeedback.\nThe MAX5019 uses an internal ramp generator for\nslope compensation. The internal ramp signal is resetat the beginning of each cycle and slews at 26mV/µs.\nThe PWM comparator uses the instantaneous current,\nthe error voltage, the internal reference, and the slopecompensation (MAX5019 only) to determine when toswitch the N-channel MOSFET off. In normal operation\nthe N-channel MOSFET turns off when:\nwhere I\nPRIMARY is the current through the N-channel\nMOSFET, V REFis the 2.4V internal reference, V EAis the\noutput voltage of the internal amplifier, and V SCOMP is\na ramp function starting at 0 and slewing at 26mV/µs(MAX5019 only). When using the MAX5019 in a for-ward-converter configuration the following conditionmust be met to avoid control-loop subharmonic oscilla-tions:\nwhere k = 0.75 to 1, and N\nSand N Pare the number of\nturns on the secondary and primary side of the trans-former, respectively. L is the output filter inductor. Thismakes the output inductor current downslope as refer-enced across R\nSENSE equal to the slope compensa-\ntion. The controller responds to transients within onecycle when this condition is met.\nN-Channel MOSFET Gate Driver\nNDRV drives an N-channel MOSFET. NDRV sourcesand sinks large transient currents to charge and dis-charge the MOSFET gate. To support such switchingtransients, bypass V\nCCwith a ceramic capacitor. The\naverage current as a result of switching the MOSFET isthe product of the total gate charge and the operatingfrequency. It is this current plus the DC quiescent cur-rent that determines the total operating current.\nApplications Information\nDesign Example\nThe following is a general procedure for designing aforward converter using the MAX5020.\n1) Determine the requirements.2) Set the output voltage.3) Calculate the transformer primary to secondary\nwinding turns ratio.\n4) Calculate the reset to primary winding turns ratio.5) Calculate the tertiary to primary winding turns\nratio.\n6) Calculate the current-sense resistor value.7) Calculate the output inductor value.8) Select the output capacitor.\nThe circuit in Figure 2 was designed as follows:N\nNkR VS\nPSENSE OUT×××=µLmV s26 /IR V - V - VPRIMARY SENSE EA REF SCOMP ×>\nVN\nNR\nRVOUTS\nT1\n2REF =+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7× 1VR\nRVOUT1\n2REF =+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7× 1RISENSE LimPrimary =0 465./VCurrent-Mode PWM Controllers with Integrated\nStartup Circuit\n10 ______________________________________________________________________________________\n1) 36V ≤VIN≤72V, V OUT = 5V, I OUT = 10A, V RIPPLE ≤\n50mV\n2) To set the output voltage calculate the values of\nresistors R1 and R2 according to the following equation:\nwhere V\nREF is the reference voltage of the shunt\nregulator, and R 1and R 2are the resistors shown in\nFigures 2 and 3.\n3) The turns ratio of the transformer is calculated based\non the minimum input voltage and the lower limit ofthe maximum duty cycle for the MAX5020 (44%). Toenable the use of MOSFETs with drain-sourcebreakdown voltages of less than 200V use theMAX5020 with the 50% maximum duty cycle.Calculate the turns ratio according to the followingequation:\nwhere:\nN\nS/NP= Turns ratio (N Sis the number of secondary\nturns and N Pis the number of primary turns).\nVOUT= Output voltage (5V).\nVD1= Voltage drop across D1 (typically 0.5V for\npower Schottky diodes).\nDMAX = Minimum value of maximum operating duty\ncycle (44%).\nVIN_MIN = Minimum Input voltage (36V).\nIn this example:\nChoose N Pbased on core losses and DC resis-\ntance. Use the turns ratio to calculate N S, rounding\nup to the nearest integer. In this example N P= 14\nand N S= 5.\nFor a forward converter choose a transformer with a\nmagnetizing inductance in the neighborhood of200µH. Energy stored in the magnetizing inductanceof a forward converter is not delivered to the load\nand must be returned back to the input; this isaccomplished with the reset winding.\nThe transformer primary to secondary leakage\ninductance should be less than 1µH. Note that allleakage energy will be dissipated across the MOS-FET. Snubber circuits may be used to direct some orall of the leakage energy to be dissipated across aresistor.\nTo calculate the minimum duty cycle (D\nMIN) use the \nfollowing equation:\nwhere V IN_MAX is the maximum input voltage (72V).\n4) The reset winding turns ratio (N R/NP) needs to be\nlow enough to guarantee that the entire energy inthe transformer is returned to V+ within the off cycleat the maximum duty cycle. Use the following equa-tion to determine the reset winding turns ratio:\nwhere:\nN\nR/NP= Reset winding turns ratio.\nDMAX’ =  Maximum value of Maximum Duty Cycle.\nRound N Rto the nearest smallest integer.\nThe turns ratio of the reset winding (N R/NP) will\ndetermine the peak voltage across the N-channelMOSFET.\nUse the following equation to determine the maxi-\nmum drain-source voltage across the N-channelMOSFET:\nV\nDSMAX = Maximum MOSFET drain-source voltage.\nVIN_MAX = Maximum input voltage.VV 1  +  N\nNDSMAX IN_MAXP\nR≥×\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7N11-0.5\n0.5R≤× =41 4NN1-D\nDRPMAX\nMAX≤×′\n′DV\nVN\nN-VMINOUT\nIN_MAXS\nPD1=\n×\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nN\nN5V+ 0.5V 0.44S\nP≥× ()\n×=04 4 3 60 330..VN\nNVV D\nDVS\nPOUT D1 MAX\nMAX IN_MIN≥+×()\n×VVR\nR\nVV VOUT REF1\n2\nREF SS_≅+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n<<\n=≅1\n50\n2412RR k//\n.Ω\nSHDNMAX5019/MAX5020Current-Mode PWM Controllers with Integrated\nStartup Circuit\n______________________________________________________________________________________ 11\nMAX5019/MAX5020Choose MOSFETs with appropriate avalanche\npower ratings.\n5) Choose the tertiary winding turns ratio (N T/NP) so\nthat the minimum input voltage provides the mini-mum operating voltage at V\nDD(13V).

Choose a capacitor with alow ESR to yield the required ripple voltage. \nUse the following equations to calculate the peak-to-\npeak output ripple:\nwhere:\nV\nRIPPLE is the combined RMS output ripple due to\nVRIPPLE,ESR , the ESR ripple, and V RIPPLE,C , the\ncapacitive ripple. Calculate the ESR ripple andcapacitive ripple as follows:\nV\nRIPPLE,ESR = IRIPPLE x ESR\nVRIPPLE,C = IRIPPLE /(2 x πx 275kHz x C OUT)\nLayout Recommendations\nAll connections carrying pulsed currents must be very\nshort, be as wide as possible, and have a ground planeas a return path. The inductance of these connectionsmust be kept to a minimum due to the high di/dt of thecurrents in high-frequency switching power converters. \nCurrent loops must be analyzed in any layout pro-\nposed, and the internal area kept to a minimum toreduce radiated EMI. Ground planes must be kept asintact as possible.\nChip Information\nTRANSISTOR COUNT: 589\nPROCESS: BiCMOSVV VRIPPLE RIPPLEESR RIPPLE C =+,,22L-≥() ×()\n××=µ5 5 1 0 198\n0 4 275 1040 1..\n..kHz AHLV-OUT≥+ () ×()\n×× ×VD\nLIR kHz IDM I N\nOUTMAX1\n2 275\nRSENSE ≤\n××=Ω0 465\n5\n1412 1 0109.\n.VmRV\nN\nNSENSEILIM\nS\nP≤\n××12.IOUTMAX13 7436 714\n53 3 71 4..\n..361N72\nNT\nT×≤ ≤ ×\n≤≤V\nVNN\nV\nVNDDMIN\nIN_MINPT\nDDMAX\nIN_MAXP+×≤≤\n+×07\n07.\n.V7 1  +  14\n14DSMAX ≥×\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7= 2 144VVCurrent-Mode PWM Controllers with Integrated\nStartup Circuit\n12 ______________________________________________________________________________________\nMAX5019/MAX5020Current-Mode PWM Controllers with Integrated\nStartup Circuit\n______________________________________________________________________________________ 13International Rectifier www.irf.com\nFairchild www.fairchildsemi.com Power FETS\nVishay-Siliconix www.vishay.com/brands/siliconix/main.html\nDale-Vishay www.vishay.com/brands/dale/main.htmlCurrent-Sense Resistors\nIRC www.irctt.com/pages/index.cfm\nOn Semi www.onsemi.com\nGeneral Semiconductor www.gensemi.com Diodes\nCentral Semiconductor www.centralsemi.com\nSanyo www.sanyo.com\nTaiyo Yuden www.t-yuden.com Capacitors\nAVX www.avxcorp.com\nCoiltronics www.cooperet.com\nCoilcraft www.coilcraft.com Magnetics\nPulse Engineering www.pulseeng.comTable 1.
