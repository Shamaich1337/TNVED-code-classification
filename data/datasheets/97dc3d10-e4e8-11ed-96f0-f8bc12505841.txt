The devices conform to JEDECstandard pinouts for x8 memories.\nFeaturing high performance Byte-Program, the SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040\ndevices provide a maximum Byte-Program time of 20 µsec. These devices use Toggle Bit or Data#Polling to indicate the completion of  Program operation. To protect aga inst inadvertent write, they have\non-chip hardware and Software Data Protection schemes. Designed, manufactured, and tested for awide spectrum of applications, they are offered with a guaranteed typical endurance of 100,000 cycles.Data retention is rated at greater than 100 years.\nThe SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040 devices are suited for applications that require\nconvenient and economical updating of program, configuration, or data memory. For all system appli-cations, they significantly improves performance and reliability, while lowering power consumption.\nThey inherently use less energy during Erase and Program than alternative flash technologies. Thetotal energy consumed is a function of the applied voltage, current, and time of application. Since forany given voltage range, the SuperFlash technology uses less current to program and has a shortererase time, the total energy consumed during any Eras e or Program operation is less than alternative\nflash technologies. These devices also improve flexibility while lowering the cost for program, data, andconfiguration storage applications.\nThe SuperFlash technology provides fixed Erase and Program times, independent of the number of\nErase/Program cycles that have occurred. Therefore the system software or hardware does not haveto be modified or de-rated as is necessary with alternative flash technologies, whose Erase and Pro-gram times increase with accumulated Erase/Program cycles.\nTo meet surface mount requirements, the SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040 devices\nare offered in 32-lead PLCC and 32-lead TSOP packages.

Commands are written\nto the device using standard microprocessor write sequences. A command is written by asserting WE#\nlow while keeping CE# low. The address bus is latched on the falling edge of WE# or CE#, whicheveroccurs last. The data bus is latched on the rising edge of WE# or CE#, whichever occurs first.\nRead\nThe Read operation of the SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040 devices are controlled byCE# and OE#, both have to be low for the system to obtain data from the outputs. CE# is used fordevice selection. When CE# is high, the chip is deselected and only standby power is consumed. OE#is the output control and is used to gate data from the output pins. The data bus is in high impedancestate when either CE# or OE# is high. Refer to the Read cycle timing diagram for further details (Figure4).\nByte-Program Operation\nThe SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040 are programmed on a byte-by-byte basis.Before programming, the sector where the byte exists must be fully erased. The Program operation isaccomplished in three steps. The first step is the three-byte load sequence for Software Data Protec-tion. The second step is to load byte address and byte data. During the Byte-Program operation, theaddresses are latched on the falling edge of either CE# or WE#, whichever occurs last. The data islatched on the rising edge of either CE# or WE#, whichever occurs first. The third step is the internalProgram operation which is initiated after the rising edge of the fourth WE# or CE#, whichever occursfirst. The Program operation, once  initiated, will be completed, wit hin 20 µs. See Figures 5 and 6 for\nWE# and CE# controlled Program operation timing diagrams and Figure 15 for flowcharts. During theProgram operation, the only valid reads are Data# Polling and Toggle Bit. During the internal Programoperation, the host is free to perform additional tasks. Any commands written during the internal Pro-gram operation will be ignored. \nSector-Erase Operation\nThe Sector-Erase operation allows the system to erase the device on a sector-by-sector basis. Thesector architecture is based on uniform sector size of 4 KByte. The Sector-Erase operation is initiatedby executing a six-byte command sequence with Sector-Erase command (30H) and sector address(SA) in the last bus cycle. The sector address is latched on the fa lling edge of the sixth WE# pulse,\nwhile the command (30H) is latched on the rising edge of the sixth WE# pulse. The internal Erase\noperation begins after the sixth WE# pulse. The End-of-Erase can be determined using either Data#Polling or Toggle Bit methods. See Figure 9 for ti ming waveforms. Any commands written during the\nSector-Erase operation will be ignored.\nChip-Erase Operation\nThe SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040 devices provide a Chip-Erase operation, whichallows the user to erase the entire memory array to the ‘1’s state. This is useful when the entire devicemust be quickly erased.\nThe Chip-Erase operation is initiated by executin g a six- byte Software Data Protection command\nsequence with Chip-Erase command (10H) with address 5555H in the last byte sequence. The internal\nErase operation begins with the rising edge of the sixt h WE# or CE#, whichever occurs first. During the\n©2012 Silicon Storage Technology, Inc.

See Table 4 for the com-\nmand sequence, Figure 10 for timing diagram, and Figure 18 for the flowchart. Any commands written\nduring the Chip-Erase operation will be ignored.\nWrite Operation Status Detection\nThe SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040 devices provide two software means to detectthe completion of a Write (Program or Erase) cycle, in order to optimize the system write cycle time.The software detection includes two status bits: Data# Polling (DQ\n7) and Toggle Bit (DQ 6). The End-of-\nWrite detection mode is enabled after the rising edge of WE# which initiates the internal Program orErase operation.\nThe actual completion of the nonvolatile write is asynchronous with the system; therefore, either a\nData# Polling or Toggle Bit read ma y be simultaneous with the comple tion of the Write cycle. If this\noccurs, the system may possibly get an erroneous result, i.e., valid data may appear to conflict witheither DQ\n7 or DQ 6. In order to prevent spurious rejection, if an erroneous result occurs, the software\nroutine should include a loop to read the accessed location an additional two (2) times. If both readsare valid, then the device has completed the Wr ite cycle, otherwise the rejection is valid.\n©2012 Silicon Storage Technology, Inc. DS25023B 06/13\n81 Mbit / 2 Mbit / 4 Mbit Multi-Purpose Flash\nSST39LF010 / SST39LF020 / SST39LF040\nSST39VF010 / SST39VF020 / SST39VF040\nData Sheet\nData# Polling (DQ 7)\nWhen the SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040 are in the internal Program operation, any\nattempt to read DQ 7 will produce the complement of the tr ue data. Once the Program operation is\ncompleted, DQ 7 will produce true data. Note that even though DQ 7 may have valid data immediately\nfollowing completion of an internal Write operation, the remaining data  outputs may still be invalid: valid\ndata on the entire da ta bus will appear in subsequent successive Read cycles  after an interval of 1 µs.\nDuring internal Erase operation, any attempt to read DQ 7 will produce a “0”. Once the internal Erase\noperation is completed, DQ 7 will produce a “1”. The Data# Polling is valid after the rising edge of fourth\nWE# (or CE#) pulse for Program operation. For Sector - or Chip-Erase, the Data# Polling is valid after\nthe rising edge of sixth WE# (or CE#) pulse. See Figure 7 for Data# Polling timing diagram and Figure\n16 for a flowchart.\nToggle Bit (DQ 6)\nDuring the internal Program or Erase operation, any consecutive attempts to read DQ 6 will produce\nalternating ‘0’s and ‘1’s, i.e., toggling between 0 and 1. When the internal Program or Erase operationis completed, the toggling will stop. The device is then ready for the next operation. The Toggle Bit is\nvalid after the rising edge of fourth WE# (or CE#) pulse for Program operation. For Sector- or Chip-Erase, the Toggle Bit is valid after the rising edge of sixth WE# (or CE#) pulse. See Figure 8 for ToggleBit timing diagram and Figure 16 for a flowchart. \nData Protection\nThe SST39LF010/020/040 and SST39VF010/020/040 provide both hardware and software features toprotect nonvolatile data from inadvertent writes.\nHardware Data Protection\nNoise/Glitch Protection:  A WE# or CE# pulse of less than 5 ns will not initiate a Write cycle.\nVDD Power Up/Down Detection:  The Write operation is inhibited when V DD is less than 1.5V.\nWrite Inhibit Mode:  Forcing OE# low, CE# high, or WE# high will inhibit the Write operation. This pre-\nvents inadvertent writes during power-up or power-down.\n©2012 Silicon Storage Technology, Inc.

Any Program operationrequires the inclusion of a series of three-byte sequ ence. The three-byte load sequence is used to ini-\ntiate the Program operation, providing optimal protection from inadvertent Write operations, e.g., dur-ing the system power-up or power-down. Any Erase operation requires the inclusion of six-byte loadsequence. These devices are shipped with the Software Data Protection permanently enabled. SeeTable 4 for the specific software command codes. During SDP command sequence, invalid commandswill abort the device to read mode, within T\nRC.\nProduct Identification\nThe Product Identification mode identifies the devices as the SST39LF/VF010, SST39LF/VF020, andSST39LF/VF040 and manufacturer as SST. This mode may be accessed by software operations.Users may use the Software Product Identification operation to identify the part (i.e., using the deviceID) when using multiple ma nufacturers in the same socket. For details, see Table 4 for software opera-\ntion, Figure 11 for the Software ID Entry and Read timing diagram, and Figure 17 for the Software IDentry command sequence flowchart.\nProduct Identificatio n Mode Exit/Reset\nIn order to return to the standard Read mode, the Software Product Identification mode must be exited.Exit is accomplished by issuing the Software ID Exit command sequence, which returns the device tothe Read operation. Please note that the Software ID Exit command is ignored during an internal Pro-gram or Erase operation.
