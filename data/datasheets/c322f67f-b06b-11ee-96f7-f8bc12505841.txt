Functional description\n8.1 Architectural overview\nRemark: In the following, the notation LPC17xx refers to all parts: \nLPC1769/68/67/66/65/64/63.\nThe Arm Cortex-M3 includes three AHB-Lite buses: the system bus, the I-code bus, and \nthe D-code bus (see Figure 1). The I-code and D-code core buses are faster than the \nsystem bus and are used similarly to TCM interfaces: one bus dedicated for instruction fetch (I-code) and one bus for data access (D-code). The use of two core buses allows for simultaneous operations if concurrent operations target different devices. \nThe LPC17xx use a multi-layer AHB matrix to connect the Arm Cortex-M3 buses and \nother bus masters to peripherals in a flexible manner that optimizes performance by allowing peripherals that are on different slaves ports of the matrix to be accessed simultaneously by different bus masters. \n8.2 Arm Cortex-M3 processor\nThe Arm Cortex-M3 is a general purpose, 32-bit microprocessor, which offers high performance and very low power consumption. The Arm Cortex-M3 offers many new features, including a Thumb-2 instruction set, low interrupt latency, hardware divide, interruptible/continuable multiple load and store instructions, automatic state save and restore for interrupts, tightly integrated interrupt controller with wake-up interrupt controller, and multiple core buses capable of simultaneous accesses.\nPipeline techniques are employed so that all parts of the processing and memory systems \ncan operate continuously. Typically, while one instruction is being executed, its successor is being decoded, and a third instruction is being fetched from memory.\nThe Arm Cortex-M3 processor is described in detail in the Cortex-M3 Technical \nReference Manual  that can be found on official Arm website.\n8.3 On-chip flash program memory\nThe LPC17xx contain up to 512 kB of on-chip flash memory. A new two-port flash \naccelerator maximizes performance for use with the two fast AHB-Lite buses.\n8.4 On-chip SRAM\nThe LPC17xx contain a total of 64 kB on-chip static RAM memory. This includes the main 32 kB SRAM, accessible by the CPU and DMA controller on a higher-speed bus, and two additional 16 kB each SRAM blocks situated on a separate slave port on the AHB multilayer matrix. \nThis architecture allows CPU and DMA accesses to be spread over three separate RAMs \nthat can be accessed simultaneously.\n8.5 Memory Protection Unit (MPU)\nThe LPC17xx have a Memory Protection Unit (MPU) which can be used to improve the reliability of an embedded system by protecting critical data within the user application.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20. All rights reserved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 9.10 — 8 September 2020 22 of 93 NXP Semiconductors LPC1769/68/67/66/65/64/63\n32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller\nThe MPU allows separating processing tasks by disallowing access to each other\'s data, \ndisabling access to memory regions, allowing memory regions to be defined as read-only and detecting unexpected memory accesses that could potentially break the system.\nThe MPU separates the memory into distinct regions and implements protection by \npreventing disallowed accesses. The MPU supports up to 8 regions each of which can be divided into 8 subregions. Accesses to memory locations that are not defined in the MPU regions, or not permitted by the region setting, will cause the Memory Management Fault exception to take place.\n8.6 Memory map\nThe LPC17xx incorporates several distinct memory regions, shown in the following figures. \nFigure 5 shows the overall map of the entire address space from the user \nprogram viewpoint following reset. The interrupt vector area supports address remapping.\nThe AHB peripheral area is 2 MB in size and is divided to allow for up to 128 peripherals. \nThe APB peripheral area is 1 MB in size and is divided to allow for up to 64 peripherals. Each peripheral of either type is allocated 16 kB of space. This allows simplifying the address decoding for each peripheral.\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx x x x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xx xx xxxxx \nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx x x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

The tight coupling to the CPU allows for low \ninterrupt latency and efficient processing of late arriving interrupts.\n8.7.1 Features\n•Controls system exceptions and peripheral interrupts\n•In the LPC17xx, the NVIC supports 33 vectored interrupts\n•32 programmable interrupt priority levels, with hardware priority level masking\n•Relocatable vector table\n•Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI)\n•Software interrupt generation\n8.7.2 Interrupt sources\nEach peripheral device has one interrupt line connected to the NVIC but may have several interrupt flags. Individual interrupt flags may also represent more than one interrupt source.\nAny pin on Port 0 and Port 2 (total of 42 pins) regardless of the selected function, can be \nprogrammed to generate an interrupt on a rising edge, a falling edge, or both. \n8.8 Pin connect block\nThe pin connect block allows selected pins of the microcontroller to have more than one function. Configuration registers control the multiplexers to allow connection between the pin and the on-chip peripherals.\nPeripherals should be connected to the appropriate pins prior to being activated and prior \nto any related interrupt(s) being enabled. Activity of any enabled peripheral function that is not mapped to a related pin should be considered undefined.\nMost pins can also be configured as open-drain outputs or to have a pull-up, pull-down, or \nno resistor enabled. \n8.9 General purpose DMA controller\nThe GPDMA is an AMBA AHB compliant peripheral allowing selected peripherals to have DMA support.\nThe GPDMA enables peripheral-to-memory, memory-to-peripheral, \nperipheral-to-peripheral, and memory-to-memory transactions. The source and destination areas can each be either a memory region or a peripheral, and can be accessed through the AHB master. The GPDMA controller allows data transfers between the USB and Ethernet controllers and the various on-chip SRAM areas. The supported APB peripherals are SSP0/1, all UARTs, the I\n2S-bus interface, the ADC, and the DAC. \nTwo match signals for each timer can be used to trigger DMA transfers.\nRemark: The Ethernet controller is available on parts LPC1769/68/67/66/64. The USB \ncontroller is available on parts LPC1769/68/66/65/64. The I2S-bus interface is available on \nparts LPC1769/68/67/66/65. The DAC is available on parts LPC1769/68/67/66/65/63.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

Each channel can support an unidirectional transfer.\n•16 DMA request lines.\n•Single DMA and burst DMA request signals. Each peripheral connected to the DMA \nController can assert either a burst DMA request or a single DMA request. The DMA burst size is set by programming the DMA Controller.\n•Memory-to-memory, memory-to-peripheral, peripheral-to-memory, and peripheral-to-peripheral transfers are supported.\n•Scatter or gather DMA is supported through the use of linked lists. This means that the source and destination areas do not have to occupy contiguous areas of memory.\n•Hardware DMA channel priority.\n•AHB slave DMA programming interface. The DMA Controller is programmed by writing to the DMA control registers over the AHB slave interface.\n•One AHB bus master for transferring data. The interface transfers data when a DMA request goes active. \n•32-bit AHB master bus width.\n•Incrementing or non-incrementing addressing for source and destination.\n•Programmable DMA burst size. The DMA burst size can be programmed to more efficiently transfer data.\n•Internal four-word FIFO per channel.\n•Supports 8, 16, and 32-bit wide transactions.\n•Big-endian and little-endian support. The DMA Controller defaults to little-endian mode on reset.\n•An interrupt to the processor can be generated on a DMA completion or when a DMA error has occurred.\n•Raw interrupt status. The DMA error and DMA count raw interrupt status can be read prior to masking.\n8.10 Fast general purpose parallel I/O\nDevice pins that are not connected to a specific peripheral function are controlled by the GPIO registers. Pins may be dynamically configured as inputs or outputs. Separate registers allow setting or clearing any number of outputs simultaneously. The value of the output register may be read back as well as the current state of the port pins.\nLPC17xx use accelerated GPIO functions:\n•GPIO registers are accessed through the AHB multilayer bus so that the fastest \npossible I/O timing can be achieved.\n•Mask registers allow treating sets of port bits as a group, leaving other bits unchanged.\n•All GPIO registers are byte and half-word addressable.\n•Entire port value can be written in one instruction.\n•Support for Cortex-M3 bit banding.\n•Support for use with the GPDMA controller.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

The edge detection is asynchronous, so it may operate when clocks are not present such as during Power-down mode. Each enabled interrupt can be used to wake up the chip from Power-down mode. \n8.10.1 Features\n•Bit level set and clear registers allow a single instruction to set or clear any number of bits in one port.\n•Direction control of individual bits.\n•All I/O default to inputs after reset.\n•Pull-up/pull-down resistor configuration and open-drain configuration can be programmed through the pin connect block for each GPIO pin.\n8.11 Ethernet \nRemark: The Ethernet controller is available on parts LPC1769/68/67/66/64. The \nEthernet block supports bus clock rates of up to 100 MHz (LPC1768/67/66/64) or 120 MHz (LPC1769). See \nTable 2.\nThe Ethernet block contains a full featured 10 Mbit/s or 100 Mbit/s Ethernet MAC \ndesigned to provide optimized performance through the use of DMA hardware acceleration.

Each device is recognized by a unique address and can operate as either a receiver-only device (e.g., an LCD driver) or a transmitter with the capability to both receive and send information (such as memory). Transmitters and/or receivers can operate in either master or slave mode, depending on whether the chip has to initiate a data transfer or is only addressed.

See \nTable 2.\nThe I2S-bus provides a standard communication interface for digital audio applications.\nThe I2S-bus specification  defines a 3-wire serial bus using one data line, one clock line, \nand one word select signal. The basic I2S-bus connection has one master, which is \nalways the master, and one slave. The I2S-bus interface provides a separate transmit and \nreceive channel, each of which can operate as either a master or a slave.\n8.20.1 Features\n•The interface has separate input/output channels each of which can operate in master or slave mode.\n•Capable of handling 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit word sizes.\n•Mono and stereo audio data supported.\n•The sampling frequency can range from 16 kHz to 96 kHz (16, 22.05, 32, 44.1, 48, 96) kHz.\n•Support for an audio master clock.\n•Configurable word select period in master mode (separately for I2S-bus input and \noutput).\n•Two 8-word FIFO data buffers are provided, one for transmit and one for receive.\n•Generates interrupt requests when buffer levels cross a programmable boundary.\n•Two DMA requests, controlled by programmable buffer levels. These are connected to the GPDMA block.\n•Controls include reset, stop and mute options separately for I2S-bus input and I2S-bus \noutput.\n8.21 General purpose 32-bit timers/external event counters\nThe LPC17xx include four 32-bit timer/counters. The timer/counter is designed to count cycles of the system derived clock or an externally-supplied clock. It can optionally generate interrupts, generate timed DMA requests, or perform other actions at specified timer values, based on four match registers. Each timer/counter also includes two capture inputs to trap the timer value when an input signal transitions, optionally generating an interrupt.\n8.21.1 Features\n•A 32-bit timer/counter with a programmable 32-bit prescaler.\n•Counter or timer operation.\n•Two 32-bit capture channels per timer, that can take a snapshot of the timer value when an input signal transitions. A capture event may also generate an interrupt.\n•Four 32-bit match registers that allow:\n–Continuous operation with optional interrupt generation on match.\n–Stop timer on match with optional interrupt generation.\n–Reset timer on match with optional interrupt generation.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20. All rights reserved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 9.10 — 8 September 2020 33 of 93 NXP Semiconductors LPC1769/68/67/66/65/64/63\n32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller\n•Up to four external outputs corresponding to match registers, with the following \ncapabilities:\n–Set LOW on match.\n–Set HIGH on match.\n–Toggle on match.\n–Do nothing on match.\n•Up to two match registers can be used to generate timed DMA requests.\n8.22 Pulse width modulator\nThe PWM is based on the standard Timer block and inherits all of its features, although \nonly the PWM function is pinned out on the LPC17xx. The Timer is designed to count cycles of the system derived clock and optionally switch pins, generate interrupts or perform other actions when specified timer values occur, based on seven match registers. The PWM function is in addition to these features, and is based on match register events.\nThe ability to separately control rising and falling edge locations allows the PWM to be \nused for more applications. For instance, multi-phase motor control typically requires three non-overlapping PWM outputs with individual control of all three pulse widths and positions.\nTwo match registers can be used to provide a single edge controlled PWM output. One \nmatch register (PWMMR0) controls the PWM cycle rate, by resetting the count upon match. The other match register controls the PWM edge position. Additional single edge controlled PWM outputs require only one match register each, since the repetition rate is the same for all PWM outputs. Multiple single edge controlled PWM outputs will all have a rising edge at the beginning of each PWM cycle, when an PWMMR0 match occurs.\nThree match registers can be used to provide a PWM output with both edges controlled. \nAgain, the PWMMR0 match register controls the PWM cycle rate. The other match registers control the two PWM edge positions. Additional double edge controlled PWM outputs require only two match registers each, since the repetition rate is the same for all PWM outputs.\nWith double edge controlled PWM outputs, specific match registers control the rising and \nfalling edge of the output. This allows both positive going PWM pulses (when the rising edge occurs prior to the falling edge), and negative going PWM pulses (when the falling edge occurs prior to the rising edge).\n8.22.1 Features\n•One PWM block with Counter or Timer operation (may use the peripheral clock or one of the capture inputs as the clock source).\n•Seven match registers allow up to 6 single edge controlled or 3 double edge controlled PWM outputs, or a mix of both types. The match registers also allow:\n–Continuous operation with optional interrupt generation on match.\n–Stop timer on match with optional interrupt generation.\n–Reset timer on match with optional interrupt generation.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

Single \nedge controlled PWM outputs all go high at the beginning of each cycle unless the output is a constant low. Double edge controlled PWM outputs can have either edge occur at any position within a cycle. This allows for both positive going and negative going pulses.\n•Pulse period and width can be any number of timer counts. This allows complete flexibility in the trade-off between resolution and repetition rate. All PWM outputs will occur at the same repetition rate.\n•Double edge controlled PWM outputs can be programmed to be either positive going or negative going pulses.\n•Match register updates are synchronized with pulse outputs to prevent generation of erroneous pulses. Software must ‘release’ new match values before they can become effective.\n•May be used as a standard 32-bit timer/counter with a programmable 32-bit prescaler if the PWM mode is not enabled.\n8.23 Motor control PWM\nThe motor control PWM is a specialized PWM supporting 3-phase motors and other combinations. Feedback inputs are provided to automatically sense rotor position and use that information to ramp speed up or down. An abort input is also provided that causes the PWM to immediately release all motor drive outputs. At the same time, the motor control PWM is highly configurable for other generalized timing, counting, capture, and compare applications.\n8.24 Quadrature Encoder Interface (QEI)\nA quadrature encoder, also known as a 2-channel incremental encoder, converts angular displacement into two pulse signals. By monitoring both the number of pulses and the relative phase of the two signals, the user can track the position, direction of rotation, and velocity. In addition, a third channel, or index signal, can be used to reset the position counter. The quadrature encoder interface decodes the digital pulses from a quadrature encoder wheel to integrate position over time and determine direction of rotation. In addition, the QEI can capture the velocity of the encoder wheel.\n8.24.1 Features\n•Tracks encoder position.\n•Increments/decrements depending on direction.\n•Programmable for 2 \uf0b4 or 4\uf0b4 position counting.\n•Velocity capture using built-in timer.\n•Velocity compare function with “less than” interrupt.\n•Uses 32-bit registers for position and velocity.\n•Three position compare registers with interrupts.\n•Index counter for revolution counting.\n•Index compare register with interrupts.\n•Can combine index and position interrupts to produce an interrupt for whole and \npartial revolution displacement.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

Any bits of the timer/compare can be masked such that they do not contribute to the match detection. The repetitive interrupt timer can be used to create an interrupt that repeats at predetermined intervals.\n8.25.1 Features\n•32-bit counter running from PCLK. Counter can be free-running or be reset by a generated interrupt.\n•32-bit compare value.\n•32-bit compare mask. An interrupt is generated when the counter value equals the compare value, after masking. This allows for combinations not possible with a simple compare.\n8.26 Arm Cortex-M3 system tick timer\nThe Arm Cortex-M3 includes a system tick timer (SYSTICK) that is intended to generate a dedicated SYSTICK exception at a 10 ms interval. In the LPC17xx, this timer can be clocked from the internal AHB clock or from a device pin.\n8.27 Watchdog timer\nThe purpose of the watchdog is to reset the microcontroller within a reasonable amount of time if it enters an erroneous state. When enabled, the watchdog will generate a system reset if the user program fails to ‘feed’ (or reload) the watchdog within a predetermined amount of time.\n8.27.1 Features\n•Internally resets chip if not periodically reloaded.\n•Debug mode.\n•Enabled by software but requires a hardware reset or a watchdog reset/interrupt to be disabled.\n•Incorrect/Incomplete feed sequence causes reset/interrupt if enabled.\n•Flag to indicate watchdog reset.\n•Programmable 32-bit timer with internal prescaler.\n•Selectable time period from (T cy(WDCLK)  \uf0b4 256 \uf0b4 4) to (T cy(WDCLK)  \uf0b4 232 \uf0b4 4) in \nmultiples of T cy(WDCLK)  \uf0b4 4.\n•The Watchdog Clock (WDCLK) source can be selected from the Internal RC (IRC) \noscillator, the RTC oscillator, or the APB peripheral clock. This gives a wide range of potential timing choices of Watchdog operation under different power reduction \nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

It also provides the ability to run the WDT from an entirely internal source \nthat is not dependent on an external crystal and its associated components and wiring for increased reliability.\n•Includes lock/safe feature.\n8.28 RTC and backup registers\nThe RTC is a set of counters for measuring time when system power is on, and optionally when it is off. The RTC on the LPC17xx is designed to have extremely low power consumption, i.e. less than 1 \uf06dA. The RTC will typically run from the main chip power \nsupply, conserving battery power while the rest of the device is powered up. When operating from a battery, the RTC will continue working down to 2.1 V. Battery power can be provided from a standard 3 V Lithium button cell.\nAn ultra-low power 32 kHz oscillator will provide a 1 Hz clock to the time counting portion \nof the RTC, moving most of the power consumption out of the time counting function.\nThe RTC includes a calibration mechanism to allow fine-tuning the count rate in a way \nthat will provide less than 1 second per day error when operated at a constant voltage and temperature. A clock output function (see \nSection 8.29.4 ) makes measuring the oscillator \nrate easy and accurate.\nThe RTC contains a small set of backup registers (20 bytes) for holding data while the \nmain part of the LPC17xx is powered off. \nThe RTC includes an alarm function that can wake up the LPC17xx from all reduced \npower modes with a time resolution of 1 s.\n8.28.1 Features\n•Measures the passage of time to maintain a calendar and clock.\n•Ultra low power design to support battery powered systems.\n•Provides Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Day of Month, Month, Year, Day of Week, and Day of Year.\n•Dedicated power supply pin can be connected to a battery or to the main 3.3 V.\n•Periodic interrupts can be generated from increments of any field of the time registers.\n•Backup registers (20 bytes) powered by VBAT.\n•RTC power supply is isolated from the rest of the chip.\n8.29 Clocking and power control\n8.29.1 Crystal oscillators\nThe LPC17xx include three independent oscillators. These are the main oscillator, the IRC oscillator, and the RTC oscillator. Each oscillator can be used for more than one purpose as required in a particular application. Any of the three clock sources can be chosen by software to drive the main PLL and ultimately the CPU.\nFollowing reset, the LPC17xx will operate from the Internal RC oscillator until switched by \nsoftware. This allows systems to operate without any external crystal and the bootloader code to operate at a known frequency. \nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

The nominal IRC frequency is 4 MHz. The IRC is trimmed to 1 % accuracy over the entire voltage and temperature range.\nUpon power-up or any chip reset, the LPC17xx use the IRC as the clock source. Software \nmay later switch to one of the other available clock sources.\n8.29.1.2 Main oscillator\nThe main oscillator can be used as the clock source for the CPU, with or without using the PLL. The main oscillator also provides the clock source for the dedicated USB PLL. \nThe main oscillator operates at frequencies of 1 MHz to 25 MHz. This frequency can be \nboosted to a higher frequency, up to the maximum CPU operating frequency, by the main PLL. The clock selected as the PLL input is PLLCLKIN. The Arm processor clock frequency is referred to as CCLK elsewhere in this document. The frequencies of PLLCLKIN and CCLK are the same value unless the PLL is active and connected. The clock frequency for each peripheral can be selected individually and is referred to as PCLK. Refer to \nSection 8.29.2  for additional information.\n8.29.1.3 RTC oscillator\nThe RTC oscillator can be used as the clock source for the RTC block, the main PLL, and/or the CPU. Fig 6.

The input \nfrequency is multiplied up to a high frequency, then divided down to provide the actual clock used by the CPU and/or the USB block. \nThe PLL0 input, in the range of 32 kHz to 25 MHz, may initially be divided down by a \nvalue ‘N’, which may be in the range of 1 to 256. This input division provides a wide range of output frequencies from the same input frequency.\nFollowing the PLL0 input divider is the PLL0 multiplier. This can multiply the input divider \noutput through the use of a Current Controlled Oscillator (CCO) by a value ‘M’, in the range of 1 through 32768. The resulting frequency must be in the range of 275 MHz to 550 MHz. The multiplier works by dividing the CCO output by the value of M, then using a phase-frequency detector to compare the divided CCO output to the multiplier input. The error value is used to adjust the CCO frequency.\nThe PLL0 is turned off and bypassed following a chip Reset and by entering Power-down \nmode. PLL0 is enabled by software only. The program must configure and activate the PLL0, wait for the PLL0 to lock, and then connect to the PLL0 as a clock source.\n8.29.3 USB PLL (PLL1)\nThe LPC17xx contain a second, dedicated USB PLL1 to provide clocking for the USB interface.\nThe PLL1 receives its clock input from the main oscillator only and provides a fixed \n48 MHz clock to the USB block only. The PLL1 is disabled and powered off on reset. If the PLL1 is left disabled, the USB clock will be supplied by the 48 MHz clock from the main PLL0.\nThe PLL1 accepts an input clock frequency in the range of 10 MHz to 25 MHz only. The \ninput frequency is multiplied up the range of 48 MHz for the USB clock using a Current Controlled Oscillators (CCO). It is insured that the PLL1 output has a 50 % duty cycle. \n8.29.4 RTC clock output\nThe LPC17xx feature a clock output function intended for synchronizing with external devices and for use during system development to allow checking the internal clocks CCLK, IRC clock, main crystal, RTC clock, and USB clock in the outside world. The RTC clock output allows tuning the RTC frequency without probing the pin, which would distort the results.\n8.29.5 Wake-up timer\nThe LPC17xx begin operation at power-up and when awakened from Power-down mode by using the 4 MHz IRC oscillator as the clock source. This allows chip operation to resume quickly. If the main oscillator or the PLL is needed by the application, software will need to enable these features and wait for them to stabilize before they are used as a clock source.\nWhen the main oscillator is initially activated, the wake-up timer allows software to ensure \nthat the main oscillator is fully functional before the processor uses it as a clock source and starts to execute instructions. This is important at power on, all types of Reset, and \nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

Since the \noscillator and other functions are turned off during Power-down mode, any wake-up of the processor from Power-down mode makes use of the wake-up timer.\nThe Wake-up Timer monitors the crystal oscillator to check whether it is safe to begin \ncode execution. When power is applied to the chip, or when some event caused the chip to exit Power-down mode, some time is required for the oscillator to produce a signal of sufficient amplitude to drive the clock logic. The amount of time depends on many factors, including the rate of V\nDD(3V3)  ramp (in the case of power on), the type of crystal and its \nelectrical characteristics (if a quartz crystal is used), as well as any other external circuitry (e.g., capacitors), and the characteristics of the oscillator itself under the existing ambient conditions.\n8.29.6 Power control\nThe LPC17xx support a variety of power control features. There are four special modes of processor power reduction: Sleep mode, Deep-sleep mode, Power-down mode, and Deep power-down mode. The CPU clock rate may also be controlled as needed by changing clock sources, reconfiguring PLL values, and/or altering the CPU clock divider value. This allows a trade-off of power versus processing speed based on application requirements. In addition, Peripheral Power Control allows shutting down the clocks to individual on-chip peripherals, allowing fine tuning of power consumption by eliminating all dynamic power use in any peripherals that are not required for the application. Each of the peripherals has its own clock divider which provides even better power control.\nIntegrated PMU (Power Management Unit) automatically adjust internal regulators to \nminimize power consumption during Sleep, Deep sleep, Power-down, and Deep power-down modes.\nThe LPC17xx also implement a separate power domain to allow turning off power to the \nbulk of the device while maintaining operation of the RTC and a small set of registers for storing data during any of the power-down modes.\n8.29.6.1 Sleep mode\nWhen Sleep mode is entered, the clock to the core is stopped. Resumption from the Sleep mode does not need any special sequence but re-enabling the clock to the Arm core.\nIn Sleep mode, execution of instructions is suspended until either a Reset or interrupt \noccurs. Peripheral functions continue operation during Sleep mode and may generate interrupts to cause the processor to resume execution. Sleep mode eliminates dynamic power used by the processor itself, memory systems and related controllers, and internal buses.\n8.29.6.2 Deep-sleep mode\nIn Deep-sleep mode, the oscillator is shut down and the chip receives no internal clocks. The processor state and registers, peripheral registers, and internal SRAM values are preserved throughout Deep-sleep mode and the logic levels of chip pins remain static. The output of the IRC is disabled but the IRC is not powered down for a fast wake-up later. The RTC oscillator is not stopped because the RTC interrupts may be used as the wake-up source. The PLL is automatically turned off and disconnected. The CCLK and USB clock dividers automatically get reset to zero.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20. All rights reserved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 9.10 — 8 September 2020 40 of 93 NXP Semiconductors LPC1769/68/67/66/65/64/63\n32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller\nThe Deep-sleep mode can be terminated and normal operation resumed by either a \nReset or certain specific interrupts that are able to function without clocks. Since all dynamic operation of the chip is suspended, Deep-sleep mode reduces chip power consumption to a very low value. Power to the flash memory is left on in Deep-sleep mode, allowing a very quick wake-up.\nOn wake-up from Deep-sleep mode, the code execution and peripherals activities will \nresume after 4 cycles expire if the IRC was used before entering Deep-sleep mode. If the main external oscillator was used, the code execution will resume when 4096 cycles expire. PLL and clock dividers need to be reconfigured accordingly.\n8.29.6.3 Power-down mode\nPower-down mode does everything that Deep-sleep mode does, but also turns off the power to the IRC oscillator and the flash memory. This saves more power but requires waiting for resumption of flash operation before execution of code or data access in the flash memory can be accomplished.\nOn the wake-up of Power-down mode, if the IRC was used before entering Power-down \nmode, it will take IRC 60 \uf06ds to start-up. After this 4 IRC cycles will expire before the code \nexecution can then be resumed if the code was running from SRAM. In the meantime, the flash wake-up timer then counts 4 MHz IRC clock cycles to make the 100 \uf06ds flash start-up \ntime. When it times out, access to the flash will be allowed. Users need to reconfigure the PLL and clock dividers accordingly.\n8.29.6.4 Deep power-down mode\nThe Deep power-down mode can only be entered from the RTC block. In Deep power-down mode, power is shut off to the entire chip with the exception of the RTC module and the \nRESET pin. \nThe LPC17xx can wake up from Deep power-down mode via the RESET pin or an alarm \nmatch event of the RTC.\n8.29.6.5 Wake-up interrupt controller \nThe Wake-up Interrupt Controller (WIC) allows the CPU to automatically wake up from any enabled priority interrupt that can occur while the clocks are stopped in Deep sleep, Power-down, and Deep power-down modes.\nThe WIC works in connection with the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When \nthe CPU enters Deep sleep, Power-down, or Deep power-down mode, the NVIC sends a mask of the current interrupt situation to the WIC.This mask includes all of the interrupts that are both enabled and of sufficient priority to be serviced immediately. With this information, the WIC simply notices when one of the interrupts has occurred and then it wakes up the CPU. \nThe WIC eliminates the need to periodically wake up the CPU and poll the interrupts \nresulting in additional power savings. \n8.29.7 Peripheral power control\nA Power Control for Peripherals feature allows individual peripherals to be turned off if they are not needed in the application, resulting in additional power savings. \nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

This approach requires only one 3.3 V power \nsupply for both pads, the CPU, and peripherals. While this solution is simple, it does not support powering down the I/O pad ring “on the fly” while keeping the CPU and peripherals alive.\nThe second option uses two power supplies; a 3.3 V supply for the I/O pads (V\nDD(3V3) ) and \na dedicated 3.3 V supply for the CPU (V DD(REG)(3V3) ). Having the on-chip voltage regulator \npowered independently from the I/O pad ring enables shutting down of the I/O pad power supply “on the fly”, while the CPU and peripherals stay active.\nThe VBAT pin supplies power only to the RTC domain. The RTC requires a minimum of \npower to operate, which can be supplied by an external battery. The device core power (V\nDD(REG)(3V3) ) is used to operate the RTC whenever V DD(REG)(3V3)  is present. Therefore, \nthere is no power drain from the RTC battery when V DD(REG)(3V3)  is available. \nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

The RESET pin is a Schmitt \ntrigger input pin. Assertion of chip Reset by any source, once the operating voltage attains a usable level, causes the \nRSTOUT pin to go LOW and starts the wake-up timer (see \ndescription in Section 8.29.5 ). The wake-up timer ensures that reset remains asserted \nuntil the external Reset is de-asserted, the oscillator is running, a fixed number of clocks have passed, and the flash controller has completed its initialization. Once reset is de-asserted, or, in case of a BOD-triggered reset, once the voltage rises above the BOD threshold, the \nRSTOUT pin goes HIGH.\nWhen the internal Reset is removed, the processor begins executing at address 0, which \nis initially the Reset vector mapped from the Boot Block. At that point, all of the processor and peripheral registers have been initialized to predetermined values.Fig 7.

If this \nvoltage falls below 2.2 V, the BOD asserts an interrupt signal to the Vectored Interrupt Controller. This signal can be enabled for interrupt in the Interrupt Enable Register in the NVIC in order to cause a CPU interrupt; if not, software can monitor the signal by reading a dedicated status register.\nThe second stage of low-voltage detection asserts reset to inactivate the LPC17xx when \nthe voltage on the V\nDD(REG)(3V3)  pins falls below 1.85 V. This reset prevents alteration of \nthe flash as operation of the various elements of the chip would otherwise become unreliable due to low voltage. The BOD circuit maintains this reset down below 1 V, at which point the power-on reset circuitry maintains the overall reset.\nBoth the 2.2 V and 1.85 V thresholds include some hysteresis. In normal operation, this \nhysteresis allows the 2.2 V detection to reliably interrupt, or a regularly executed event loop to sense the condition.\n8.30.3 Code security (Code Read Protection - CRP)\nThis feature of the LPC17xx allows user to enable different levels of security in the system so that access to the on-chip flash and use of the JTAG and ISP can be restricted. When needed, CRP is invoked by programming a specific pattern into a dedicated flash location. IAP commands are not affected by the CRP.\nThere are three levels of the Code Read Protection.CRP1 disables access to chip via the JTAG and allows partial flash update (excluding \nflash sector 0) using a limited set of the ISP commands. This mode is useful when CRP is required and flash field updates are needed but all sectors can not be erased.\nCRP2 disables access to chip via the JTAG and only allows full flash erase and update \nusing a reduced set of the ISP commands.\nRunning an application with level CRP3 selected fully disables any access to chip via the \nJTAG pins and the ISP. This mode effectively disables ISP override using P2[10] pin, too. It is up to the user’s application to provide (if needed) flash update mechanism using IAP calls or call reinvoke ISP command to enable flash update via UART0.\n \n8.30.4 APB interface\nThe APB peripherals are split into two separate APB buses in order to distribute the bus bandwidth and thereby reducing stalls caused by contention between the CPU and the GPDMA controller.CAUTION\nIf level three Code Read Protection (CRP3) is selected, no future factory testing can be \nperformed on the device.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

This matrix connects the instruction (I-code) \nand data (D-code) CPU buses of the Arm Cortex-M3 to the flash memory, the main (32 kB) static RAM, and the Boot ROM. The GPDMA can also access all of these memories. The peripheral DMA controllers, Ethernet, and USB can access all SRAM blocks. Additionally, the matrix connects the CPU system bus and all of the DMA controllers to the various peripheral functions. \n8.30.6 External interrupt inputs\nThe LPC17xx include up to 46 edge sensitive interrupt inputs combined with up to four level sensitive external interrupt inputs as selectable pin functions. The external interrupt inputs can optionally be used to wake up the processor from Power-down mode.\n8.30.7 Memory mapping control\nThe Cortex-M3 incorporates a mechanism that allows remapping the interrupt vector table to alternate locations in the memory map. This is controlled via the Vector Table Offset Register contained in the NVIC.\nThe vector table may be located anywhere within the bottom 1 GB of Cortex-M3 address \nspace. The vector table must be located on a 128 word (512 byte) boundary because the NVIC on the LPC17xx is configured for 128 total interrupts. \n8.31 Emulation and debugging\nDebug and trace functions are integrated into the Arm Cortex-M3. Serial wire debug and trace functions are supported in addition to a standard JTAG debug and parallel trace functions. The Arm Cortex-M3 is configured to support up to eight breakpoints and four watch points.\nLPC1769_68_67_66_65_64_63 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 20 20.

[3] A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (with respect to the \nV\nIH(min) of the SCL signal) to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.\n[4] C b = total capacitance of one bus line in pF. \n[5] The maximum t f for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA \noutput stage t f is specified at 250 ns. This allows series protection resistors to be connected in between the \nSDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without exceeding the maximum specified t f.\n[6] In Fast-mode Plus, fall time is specified the same for both output stage and bus timing. If series resistors \nare used, designers should allow for this when considering bus timing.\n[7] tHD;DAT is the data hold time that is measured from the falling edge of SCL; applies to data in transmission \nand the acknowledge.\n[8] The maximum t HD;DAT  could be 3.45 \uf06ds and 0.9 \uf06ds for Standard-mode and Fast-mode but must be less than \nthe maximum of t VD;DAT  or t VD;ACK  by a transition time (see the I2C-bus specification UM10204 ). This \nmaximum must only be met if the device does not stretch the LOW period (t LOW) of the SCL signal. If the \nclock stretches the SCL, the data must be valid by the set-up time before it releases the clock.\n[9] tSU;DAT is the data set-up time that is measured with respect to the rising edge of SCL; applies to data in \ntransmission and the acknowledge.\n[10] A Fast-mode I2C-bus device can be used in a Standard-mode I2C-bus system but the requirement t SU;DAT  = \n250 ns must then be met. This will automatically be the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the SDA line t\nr(max)  + tSU;DAT  = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the Standard-mode I2C-bus \nspecification) before the SCL line is released. Also the acknowledge timing must meet this set-up time.Table 14.

Application information\n15.1 Suggested USB interface solutions\nRemark: The USB controller is available as a device/Host/OTG controller on parts \nLPC1769/68/66/65 and as device-only controller on part LPC1764.\nIf the LPC1769/68/67/66/65/64/63 V DD is always greater than 0 V while V BUS = 5 V, the \nVBUS pin can be connected directly to the V BUS pin on the USB connector.\nThis applies to bus powered devices where the USB cable supplies the system power. For \nsystems where V DD can be 0 V and V BUS is directly applied to the V BUS pin, precautions \nmust be taken to reduce the voltage to below 3.6 V.\n \nThe maximum allowable voltage on the V BUS pin is 3.6 V. One method is to use a voltage \ndivider to connect the V BUS pin to the V BUS on the USB connector.\nThe voltage divider ratio should be such that the V BUS pin will be greater than 0.7V DD to \nindicate a logic HIGH while below the 3.6 V allowable maximum voltage.\nUse the following operating conditions:\nVBUS max = 5.25 V\nVDD = 3.6 V\nThe voltage divider would need to provide a reduction of 3.6 V/5.25 V or ~0.686 V.Fig 30.

If the oscillator is driven by a \nclock in slave mode, it is recommended that the input be coupled through a capacitor with C\ni = 100 pF. To limit the input voltage to the specified range, choose an additional \ncapacitor to ground C g which attenuates the input voltage by a factor C i/(Ci + C g). In slave \nmode, a minimum of 200 mV(RMS) is needed. \n \nIn slave mode the input clock signal should be coupled by means of a capacitor of 100 pF (\nFigure 36), with an amplitude between 200 mV(RMS) and 1000 mV(RMS). This \ncorresponds to a square wave signal with a signal swing of between 280 mV and 1.4 V. The XTALOUT pin in this configuration can be left unconnected. \nExternal components and models used in oscillation mode are shown in \nFigure 37 and in \nTable 23 and Table 24. Since the feedback resistance is integrated on chip, only a crystal \nand the capacitances C X1 and C X2 need to be connected externally in case of \nfundamental mode oscillation (the fundamental frequency is represented by L, C L and \nRS). Capacitance C P in Figure 37 represents the parallel package capacitance and should \nnot be larger than 7 pF. Parameters F OSC, CL, RS and C P are supplied by the crystal \nmanufacturer.Fig 35.

Take care that the load capacitors C x1, Cx2, and C x3 in case of \nthird overtone crystal usage have a common ground plane. The external components must also be connected to the ground plain. Loops must be made as small as possible in Fig 37. Oscillator modes and models: oscillation mode of operation and external crystal \nmodel used for C X1/CX2 evaluation\nTable 23.
