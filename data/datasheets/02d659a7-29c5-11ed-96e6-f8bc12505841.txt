The devices are capable of supplying 500mA of \noutput current with a dropout voltage of 300mV. Designed for use in battery-powered systems, the low 30µA quiescent current makes them an ideal choice. Quiescent current is well controlled; it does not rise in dropout as it does with many other regulators.\nA key feature of the L T1763 regulators is low output noise. \nWith the addition of an external 0.01µF bypass capacitor, output noise drops to 20µV\nRMS over a 10Hz to 100kHz \nbandwidth. The L T1763 regulators are stable with output capacitors as low as 3.3µF. Small ceramic capacitors can be used without the series resistance required by other regulators.\nInternal protection circuitry includes reverse battery \nprotection, current limiting, thermal limiting and reverse current protection. The parts come in fixed output voltages of 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V, 3V, 3.3V and 5V, and as an adjustable device with a 1.22V reference voltage. The L T1763 regu -\nlators are available in 8-lead SO and 12-lead, low profile (4mm ×\n 3mm × 0.75mm) DFN packages.\n3.3V Low Noise RegulatorFeaTures\napplica Tionsn Low Noise: 20µV RMS (10Hz to 100kHz)\nn Output Current: 500mA\nn Low Quiescent Current: 30µA\nn Wide Input Voltage Range: 1.8V to 20V\nn Low Dropout Voltage: 300mV\nn Very Low Shutdown Current: < 1µA\nn No Protection Diodes Needed\nn Fixed Output Voltages: 1.5V , 1.8V, 2.5V, 3V, 3.3V, 5V\nn Adjustable Output from 1.22V to 20V\nn Stable with 3.3µF Output Capacitor\nn Stable with Aluminum, Tantalum or Ceramic Capacitors\nn Reverse Battery Protection\nn No Reverse Current\nn Overcurrent and Overtemperature Protected\nn 8-Lead SO and 12-Lead (4mm ×  3mm) DFN \nPackages\nn Cellular Phones\nn Battery-Powered Systems\nn Noise-Sensitive Instrumentation Systems\nDropout Voltage\nIN\nSHDN0.01µF10µF\n1763 TA01OUT\nSENSEVIN\n3.7V TO\n20V\nBYP\nGNDLT1763-3.33.3V AT 500mA\n20µV RMS NOISE\n1µF+\nOUTPUT CURRENT (mA)0DROPOUT VOLTAGE (mV)400\n350\n300250200150100\n50\n0\n400\n1763 TA02100 200 300 500L, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks and \nThinSOT is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.

The L T1763 (C grade) is 100% tested \nat TA = 25°C; performance at –40°C and 125°C is assured by design, \ncharacterization and correlation with statistical process controls. The \nL T1763 (I grade) is guaranteed over the full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range. The L T1763 (MP grade) is 100% tested and guaranteed over the –55°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range.\nNote 3: The L T1763 (adjustable version) is tested and specified for these \nconditions with the ADJ pin connected to the OUT pin.\nNote 4: Operating conditions are limited by maximum junction \ntemperature. The regulated output voltage specification will not apply for all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. When operating at maximum input voltage, the output current range must be limited. When operating at maximum output current, the input voltage range must be limited.\nNote 5: To satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, the L T1763 \n(adjustable version) is tested and specified for these conditions with an external resistor divider (two 250k resistors) for an output voltage of 2.44V. The external resistor divider will add a 5µA DC load on the output.Note 6: Dropout voltage is the minimum input to output voltage differential needed to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, the output voltage will be equal to: V\nIN – V DROPOUT .\nNote 7: GND pin current is tested with V IN = V OUT(NOMINAL)  or V IN = 2.3V \n(C, I grade) or 2.35V (MP grade), whichever is greater , and a current source load. This means the device is tested while operating in its dropout region. This is the worst-case GND pin current. The GND pin current will decrease slightly at higher input voltages.\nNote 8: ADJ pin bias current flows into the ADJ pin.Note 9: SHDN pin current flows into the SHDN pin.Note 10: Reverse output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and the \nOUT pin forced to the rated output voltage. This current flows into the OUT pin and out the GND pin.\nNote 11: For the L T1763, L T1763-1.5 and L T1763-1.8 dropout voltage will \nbe limited by the minimum input voltage specification under some output voltage/load conditions.

No connect \npins have no connection to any internal circuitry. These pins may be tied to either GND or V\nIN, or left floating.\nOUT (Pins 2, 3/Pin 1): Output. The output supplies power  \nto the load. A minimum output capacitor of 3.3µF is re -\nquired to prevent oscillations.

For the adjustable L\nT1763, this  \nis the input to the error amplifier. This pin is internally \nclamped to ±7V .

The ADJ pin voltage is 1.22V referenced to ground and the output voltage range is 1.22V to 20V. \nSENSE (Pin 5/Pin 2): Output Sense. For fixed volt -\nage versions of the L T1763 (L T1763-1.5/L T1763-1.8/  \nL T1763-2.5/L T1763-3/L T1763-3.3/L T1763-5), the SENSE \npin is the input to the error amplifier. Optimum regula -\ntion will be obtained at the point where the SENSE pin is connected to the OUT pin of the regulator. In critical \napplications, \nsmall voltage drops are caused by the re-\nsistance (R P) of PC traces between the regulator and the \nload. These may be eliminated by connecting the SENSE \npin to the output at the load as shown in Figure 1 (Kelvin \nSense Connection). BYP (Pin 6/Pin 4): Bypass. The BYP pin is used to bypass the reference of the L T1763 regulators to achieve low noise performance from the regulator. The BYP pin is clamped internally to ±0.6V (one V\nBE). A small capacitor from the \noutput to this pin will bypass the reference to lower the output voltage noise. A maximum value of 0.01µF can be used for reducing output voltage noise to a typical 20µV\nRMS over a 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth. If not used, \nthis pin must be left unconnected.\nGND (Pins 7, Exposed Pad Pin 13/Pins 3, 6, 7): Ground. \nThe exposed pad of the DFN package is an electrical con -\nnection to GND. To ensure proper electrical and thermal performance, solder Pin 13 to the PCB ground and tie \ndirectly \nto Pin   7. Connect the bottom of the output volt -\nage setting resistor divider directly to the GND pins for optimum load regulation performance.\nSHDN\n (Pin 8/Pin 5): Shutdown. The SHDN pin is used \nto put the L T1763 regulators into a low power shutdown \nstate. The output will be off when the SHDN pin is pulled low. The SHDN pin can be driven either by 5V logic or open-collector logic with a pull-up resistor. The pull-up resistor is required to supply the pull-up current of the open-collector gate, normally several microamperes, and the SHDN pin current, typically 1µA. If unused, the SHDN \npin must be connected to V\nIN. The device will be in the low \npower shutdown state if the SHDN pin is not connected.\nIN (Pin 10, 11/Pin 8): Input. Power is supplied to the device \nthrough the IN pin. A bypass capacitor is required on this pin if the device is more than six inches away from the main input filter capacitor. In general, the output imped -\nance of a battery rises with frequency, so it is advisable to include a bypass capacitor in battery-powered cir\ncuits. A \nbypass capacitor in the range of 1µF to 10µF is sufficient. The L T1763 regulators are designed to withstand reverse voltages on the IN pin with respect to ground and the OUT pin. In the case of a reverse input, which can happen if a battery is plugged in backwards, the device will act as if there is a diode in series with its input. There will be no reverse current flow into the regulator and no reverse voltage will appear at the load. The device will protect both itself and the load.(DE12/S8)\nNote that the voltage drop across the external PC traces will add to the dropout voltage of the regulator. The SENSE pin bias current is 10µA at the nominal rated output voltage. The SENSE pin can be pulled below ground (as in a dual supply system where the regulator load is returned to a negative supply) and still allow the device to start and operate.IN\nSHDN\n1763 F01RP\nOUT\nVINSENSE\nGNDL T1763\nRP321\n58 + +\nLOAD\nFigure 1. Kelvin Sense Connection\nFor more information www.linear .com/L T1763\nLT1763 Series 14\n1763fhThe L T1763 series are 500mA low dropout regulators with \nmicropower quiescent current and shutdown. The devices are capable of supplying 500mA at a dropout voltage of 300mV. Output voltage noise can be lowered to 20µV\nRMS \nover a 10Hz to 100kHz bandwidth with the addition of a 0.01µF reference bypass capacitor. Additionally, the reference bypass capacitor will improve transient response of the regulator, lowering the settling time for transient load conditions. The low operating quiescent current (30µA) drops to less than 1µA in shutdown. In addition to the low quiescent current, the L T1763 regulators incorporate several protection features which make them ideal for use in battery-powered systems. The devices are protected against both reverse input and reverse output voltages. In battery backup applications where the output can be held up by a backup battery when the input is pulled to ground, the L T1763-X acts like it has a diode in series with its output and prevents reverse current flow. Additionally, in dual supply applications where the regulator load is returned to a negative supply, the output can be pulled below ground by as much as 20V and still allow the device to start and operate.\nAdjustable Operation\nThe adjustable version of the L T1763 has an output voltage \nrange of 1.22V to 20V. The output voltage is set by the ratio of two external resistors, as shown in Figure 2. The device servos the output to maintain the ADJ pin voltage at 1.22V referenced to ground. The current in R1 is then equal to 1.22V/R1 and the current in R2 is the current in R1 plus the ADJ pin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current, 30nA at 25°C, flows through R2 into the ADJ pin. The output voltage can be calculated using the formula in Figure 2. The value of R1 should be no greater than 250k to minimize errors in the output voltage caused by the ADJ pin bias current. Note that in shutdown the output is turned off and the divider current will be zero. Curves of ADJ Pin Voltage vs Temperature and ADJ Pin Bias Current vs Temperature appear in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nThe adjustable device is tested and specified with the ADJ \npin tied to the OUT pin for an output voltage of 1.22V. Specifications for output voltages greater than 1.22V will be proportional to the ratio of the desired output voltage applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 2. Adjustable Operationto 1.22V: V OUT/1.22V. For example, load regulation for an \noutput current change of 1mA to 500mA is –2mV typical at V\nOUT = 1.22V. At V OUT = 12V, load regulation is:\n (12V/1.22V)(–2mV) = –19.6mV\nBypass Capacitance and Low Noise Performance\nThe \nL T1763 regulators may be used with the addition of \na bypass capacitor from V OUT to the BYP pin to lower \noutput voltage noise. A good quality low leakage capacitor \nis recommended. This capacitor will bypass the reference of the regulator, providing a low frequency noise pole. The noise pole provided by this bypass capacitor will lower the output voltage noise to as low as 20µV\nRMS \nwith the addition of a 0.01µF bypass capacitor. Using a bypass capacitor has the added benefit of improving transient response. With no bypass capacitor and a 10µF output capacitor, a 10mA to 500mA load step will settle to within 1% of its final value in less than 100µs. With the addition of a 0.01µF bypass capacitor, the output will settle to within 1% for a 10mA to 500mA load step in less than 10µs, with total output voltage deviation of less than 2.5% (see the L T1763-5 T ransient Response curve in the Typical Performance Characteristics section). However, regulator start-up time is proportional to the size of the bypass capacitor, slowing to 15ms with a 0.01µF bypass capacitor and 10µF output capacitor.IN\n1763 F02R2OUT\nVINVOUT\nADJ\nGNDL T1763\nR1+\nVVR\nRIR\nVV\nIn AOUT ADJ\nADJ\nADJ=+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7+() ()\n=\n=°12212\n12\n122\n30.\n.\n AT 25 C\nOUTPUT RANGE = 1.22V TO 20V\nFor more information www.linear .com/L T1763\nLT1763 Series 15\n1763fhOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe L T1763 regulators are designed to be stable with a \nwide range of output capacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects stability, most notably with small capaci -\ntors. A minimum output capacitor of 3.3µF with an ESR of 3Ω, or less, is recommended to prevent oscillations. The L T1763-X is a micropower device and output transient \nresponse will be a function of output capacitance. Larger values of output capacitance decrease the peak deviations and \nprovide improved transient response for larger load \ncurrent changes. Bypass capacitors, used to decouple individual components powered by the L T1763-X, will increase the effective output capacitor value. With larger capacitors used to bypass the reference (for low noise operation), larger values of output capacitors are needed. For 100pF of bypass capacitance, 4.7µF of output capaci -\ntor is recommended. With a 1000pF bypass capacitor or larger , a 6.8µF output capacitor is recommended.\nThe shaded region of Figure 3 defines the range over \nwhich the L\nT1763 regulators are stable. The minimum ESR \nneeded is defined by the amount of bypass capacitance used, while the maximum ESR is 3Ω.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across temperature and applied voltage. The most common dielectrics used are specified with EIA temperature characteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and Y5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances in a small package, but they tend to have strong voltage and temperature coefficients, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. When used with a 5V regulator, a 16V 10µF Y5V capacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1µF to 2µF for the DC bias voltage applied and over the operating temperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable characteristics and are more suitable for use as the output capacitor. The X7R type has better stability across temperature, while the X5R is less expensive and is available in higher values. Care still must be exercised when using X5R and X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R codes only specify operating temperature range and maximum capacitance change over temperature. Capacitance change due to DC bias with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than applica Tions inForMaTion\nOUTPUT CAPACITANCE (µF)1ESR (/uni03A9)4.0\n3.5\n3.02.52.01.51.00.5\n0\n3 10\n1763 F032 4 5 67 8 9STABLE REGION\nCBYP = 330pF\nCBYP ≥ 1000pFCBYP = 100pFCBYP = 0\nFigure 3.

Noise Resulting from \nTapping on a Ceramic CapacitorY5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be significant enough \nto drop capacitor values below appropriate levels. Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to improve as component case size increases, but expected capacitance at operating voltage should be verified.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a piezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates voltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, similar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or microphone works. For a ceramic capacitor, the stress can be induced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients. The resulting voltages produced can cause appreciable amounts of noise, especially when a ceramic capacitor is used for noise bypassing. A ceramic capacitor produced Figure 6’s trace in response to light tapping from a pencil. Similar vibration induced behavior can masquerade as increased output voltage noise.Thermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device will be limited \nby the maximum rated junction temperature (125°C). The power dissipated by the device will be made up of two components:\n1.\n Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage \ndifferential: (I OUT)(VIN – V OUT), and\n2. GN\nD pin current multiplied by the input voltage: \n(IGND)(VIN).\nThe GND pin current can be found by examining the GND Pin Current curves in the Typical Performance Character -\nistics section. Power dissipation will be equal to the sum of the two components listed above.\nThe L T1763 series regulators have internal thermal limiting\n \ndesigned to protect the device during overload conditions. \nFor continuous normal conditions, the maximum junction temperature rating of 125°C must not be exceeded. It is important to give careful consideration to all sources of thermal resistance from junction-to-ambient. Additional heat sources mounted nearby must also be considered.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board and its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated through-holes can also be used to spread the heat gener -\nated by power devices.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several \ndifferent board sizes and copper areas. All measurements were taken in still air on 3/32" FR-4 board with one ounce \ncopper .\nTable 1.

So, the junction temperature rise above ambient will be approximately equal to:\n 0.71W(75°C/W) = 53.3°C\nThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal to the maximum junction temperature rise above ambient plus the maximum ambient temperature, or\n:\n TJMAX = 50°C + 53.3°C = 103.3°CProtection Features\nThe L T1763 regulators incorporate several protection \nfeatures which make them ideal for use in battery-powered circuits. In addition to the normal protection features associated with monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and thermal limiting, the devices are protected against reverse input voltages, reverse output voltages and reverse voltages from output to input.\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nare intended to protect the device against current overload conditions at the output of the device. For normal operation, the junction temperature should not exceed 125°C.\nThe input of the device will withstand reverse voltages of \n20V. Current flow into the device will be limited to less than 1mA (typically less than 100µA) and no negative voltage will appear at the output. The device will protect both itself and the load. This provides protection against batteries which can be plugged in backward.\nThe output of the L T1763-X can be pulled below ground \nwithout damaging the device. If the input is left open-circuit or grounded, the output can be pulled below ground by 20V. For fixed voltage versions, the output will act like a large resistor, typically 500k or higher, limiting current flow to less than 100µA. For adjustable versions, the output will act like an open circuit; no current will flow out of the pin. If the input is powered by a voltage source, the output will source the short-circuit current of the device and will protect itself by thermal limiting. In this case, grounding the SHDN pin will turn off the device and stop the output \nfrom sourcing the short-circuit current.\nThe ADJ pin of the adjustable device can be pulled above \nor below ground by as much as 7V without damaging the device. If the input is left open-circuit or grounded, the ADJ pin will act like an open circuit when pulled below ground and like a large resistor (typically 100k) in series with a diode when pulled above ground.\nIn situations where the ADJ pin is connected to a resistor \ndivider that would pull the ADJ pin above its 7V clamp voltage if the output is pulled high, the ADJ pin input current must be limited to less than 5mA. For example, a resistor divider is used to provide a regulated 1.5V output from the 1.22V reference when the output is forced to 20V.\nFor more information www.linear .com/L T1763\nLT1763 Series 18\n1763fhFigure 7. Reverse Output CurrentThe top resistor of the resistor divider must be chosen to \nlimit the current into the ADJ pin to less than 5mA when the ADJ pin is at 7V. The 13V difference between output and ADJ pin divided by the 5mA maximum current into the ADJ pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 2.6k.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several \ndifferent input/output conditions can occur. The output voltage may be held up while the input is either pulled to ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage or is left open-circuit. Current flow back into the output will follow the curve shown in Figure 7.When the IN pin of the L T1763-X is forced below the OUT pin, or the OUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, input cur -\nrent will typically drop to less than 2µA. This can happen if the \ninput of the device is connected to a discharged \n(low voltage) battery and the output is held up by either a backup battery or a second regulator circuit. The state of the SHDN pin will have no effect on the reverse output current when the output is pulled above the input.\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)100\n90\n8070605040302010\n0REVERSE OUTPUT CURRENT (µA)\n1763 F070 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10TJ = 25°C\nVIN = 0V\nCURRENT FLOWS\nINTO OUTPUT PINV\nOUT = VADJ (LT1763)\nLT1763\nLT1763-5\nLT1763-3.3LT1763-1.5\nLT1763-1.8\nLT1763-2.5\nLT1763-3applica Tions inForMaTion\nFor more information www.linear .com/L T1763\nLT1763 Series 19\n1763fhpackage Descrip Tion\nDE/UE Package\n12-Lead Plastic DFN (4mm × 3mm)\n(Reference L TC DWG # 05-08-1695 Rev D)\n4.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\n3.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
