The L TC2241-12 is perfect for demanding communications applications with AC performance that includes 65.5dB SNR and 78dB SFDR. Ultralow jitter of 95fs\nRMS allows IF undersampling with excellent noise \nperformance.\nDC specs include ±0.7LSB INL (typ), ±0.4LSB DNL (typ) \nand no missing codes over temperature.\nThe digital outputs can be either differential LVDS, or \nsingle-ended CMOS. There are three format options for the CMOS outputs: a single bus running at the full data rate or two demultiplexed buses running at half data rate with either interleaved or simultaneous update. A separate output power supply allows the CMOS output swing to range from 0.5V to 2.625V .\nThe ENC\n+ and ENC– inputs may be driven differentially or \nsingle ended with a sine wave, PECL, LVDS, TTL, or CMOS \ninputs. An optional clock duty cycle stabilizer allows high performance over a wide range of clock duty cycles.\nSFDR vs Input Frequencyn Sample Rate: 210Msps\nn 65.5dB SNR\nn 78dB SFDR\nn 1.2GHz Full Power Bandwidth S/H\nn Single 2.5V Supply\nn Low Power Dissipation: 585mW\nn LVDS, CMOS, or Demultiplexed CMOS Outputs\nn Selectable Input Ranges: ±0.5V or ±1V\nn No Missing Codes\nn Optional Clock Duty Cycle Stabilizer\nn Shutdown and Nap Modes\nn Data Ready Output Clock\nn Pin Compatible Family\n 250Msps: L TC2242-12 (12-Bit), L\nTC2242-10 (10-Bit)\n 210Msps: L TC2241-12 (12-Bit), L\nTC2241-10 (10-Bit)\n 170Msps: L TC2240-12 (12-Bit), L\nTC2240-10 (10-Bit)\n 185Msps: L TC2220-1 (12-Bit)*\n 170Msps: L TC2220 (12-Bit), L\nTC2230 (10-Bit)*\n 135Msps: L TC2221 (12-Bit), L\nTC2231 (10-Bit)*\nn 64-Pin 9mm ×  9mm QFN Package\nn Wireless and Wired Broadband Communication\nn Cable Head-End Systems\nn Power Amplifier Linearization\nn Communications Test EquipmentL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of Linear \nTechnology Corporation.

The output is band limited to frequencies above DC to below half the sampling frequency.\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio between the \nRMS amplitude of the fundamental input frequency and the RMS amplitude of all other frequency components except the first five harmonics and DC.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nTotal harmonic distortion is the ratio of the RMS sum \nof all harmonics of the input signal to the fundamental itself. The out-of-band harmonics alias into the frequency band between DC and half the sampling frequency. THD is expressed as:\n  THD =20Log V22+V32+V42+...Vn2( )/V1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nwhere V1 is the RMS amplitude of the fundamental fre-\nquency and V2 through Vn are the amplitudes of the second through nth harmonics. The THD calculated in this data sheet uses all the harmonics up to the fifth.\nIntermodulation Distortion\nIf the ADC input signal consists of more than one spectral \ncomponent, the ADC transfer function nonlinearity can produce intermodulation distortion (IMD) in addition to THD. IMD is the change in one sinusoidal input caused by the presence of another sinusoidal input at a different frequency.\nIf two pure sine waves of frequencies fa and fb are ap-\nplied to the ADC input, nonlinearities in the ADC transfer function can create distortion products at the sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where m and n = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. The 3rd order intermodulation products are 2fa + fb, 2fb + fa, 2fa – fb and 2fb – fa. The intermodula-tion distortion is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of either input tone to the RMS value of the largest 3rd order intermodulation product.\nSpurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\nSpurious free dynamic range is the peak harmonic or spuri-\nous noise that is the largest spectral component excluding the input signal and DC. This value is expressed in decibels relative to the RMS value of a full scale input signal.\nFull Power Bandwidth\nThe full power bandwidth is that input frequency at which \nthe amplitude of the reconstructed fundamental is reduced by 3dB for a full scale input signal.\nAperture Delay Time\nThe time from when a rising ENC\n+ equals the ENC– voltage \nto the instant that the input signal is held by the sample \nand hold circuit.\nAperture Delay Jitter\nThe variation in the aperture delay time from conversion \nto conversion. This random variation will result in noise when sampling an AC input. The signal to noise ratio due to the jitter alone will be:\n SNR JITTER  = –20log (2π • f IN • tJITTER )\nCONVERTER OPERATION\nAs shown in Figure 1, the L TC2241-12 is a CMOS pipelined \nmulti-step converter . The converter has five pipelined ADC stages; a sampled analog input will result in a digitized value five cycles later (see the Timing Diagram section). For optimal performance the analog inputs should be driven differentially. The encode input is differential for improved common mode noise immunity. The L TC2241\n-12 \nhas two \nphases of operation, determined by the state of the dif-ferential ENC\n+/ENC– input pins. For brevity, the text will \nrefer to ENC+ greater than ENC– as ENC high and ENC+ \nless than ENC– as ENC low.\nLTC2241-12\n15\n224112fcapplica Tions inForMaTion\nEach pipelined stage shown in Figure 1 contains an ADC, \na reconstruction DAC and an interstage residue amplifier . In operation, the ADC quantizes the input to the stage and the quantized value is subtracted from the input by the DAC to produce a residue. The residue is amplified and output by the residue amplifier . Successive stages operate out of phase so that when the odd stages are outputting their residue, the even stages are acquiring that residue and vice versa.\nWhen ENC is low, the analog input is sampled differentially \ndirectly onto the input sample-and-hold capacitors, inside the “Input S/H” shown in the block diagram. At the instant that ENC transitions from low to high, the sampled input is held. While ENC is high, the held input voltage is buffered by the S/H amplifier which drives the first pipelined ADC stage. The first stage acquires the output of the S/H dur -\ning this high phase of ENC. When ENC goes back low, the first stage produces its residue which is acquired by the second stage. At the same time, the input S/H goes back to acquiring the analog input. When ENC goes back high, the second stage produces its residue which is acquired by the third stage. An identical process is repeated for the third and fourth stages, resulting in a fourth stage residue that is sent to the fifth stage ADC for final evaluation.\nEach ADC stage following the first has additional range to \naccommodate flash and amplifier offset errors. Results from all of the ADC stages are digitally synchronized such that the results can be properly combined in the correction logic before being sent to the output buffer .\nSAMPLE/HOLD OPERATION AND INPUT DRIVE\nSample/Hold Operation\nFigure 2 shows an equivalent circuit for the L TC2241-12 \nCMOS differential sample-and-hold. The analog inputs are connected to the sampling capacitors (C\nSAMPLE ) through \nNMOS transistors. The capacitors shown attached to each input (C\nPARASITIC ) are the summation of all other \ncapacitance associated with each input.\nDuring the sample phase when ENC is low, the transistors \nconnect the analog inputs to the sampling capacitors and they charge to, and track the differential input voltage. \nWhen ENC transitions from low to high, the sampled input voltage is held on the sampling capacitors. During the hold phase when ENC is high, the sampling capacitors are disconnected from the input and the held voltage is passed to the ADC core for processing. As ENC transitions from high to low, the inputs are reconnected to the sampling capacitors to acquire a new sample. Since the sampling capacitors still hold the previous sample, a charging glitch proportional to the change in voltage between samples will be seen at this time. If the change between the last sample and the new sample is small, the charging glitch seen at the input will be small. If the input change is large, such as the change seen with input frequencies near Nyquist, then a larger charging glitch will be seen.\nCommon Mode Bias\nFor optimal performance the analog inputs should be \ndriven differentially. Each input should swing ±0.5V for the 2V range or ±0.25V for the 1V range, around a common mode voltage of 1.25V . The V\nCM output pin (Pin 60) may \nbe used to provide the common mode bias level. V CM can \nbe tied directly to the center tap of a transformer to set the DC input level or as a reference level to an op amp Figure 2.

The V CM pin must be bypassed to \nground close to the ADC with a 2.2µF or greater capacitor .\nInput Drive Impedance\nAs with all high performance, high speed ADCs, the dy-\nnamic performance of the L TC2241-12 can be influenced by the input drive circuitry, particularly the second and third harmonics. Source impedance and input reactance can influence SFDR. At the falling edge of ENC, the sample-and-hold circuit will connect the 2pF sampling capacitor to the input pin and start the sampling period. The sampling period ends when ENC rises, holding the sampled input on the sampling capacitor . Ideally the input circuitry should be fast enough to fully charge the sampling capacitor during the sampling period 1/(2f\nS); however , this is not always \npossible and the incomplete settling may degrade the SFDR. The sampling glitch has been designed to be as linear as possible to minimize the effects of incomplete settling.\nFor the best performance, it is recommended to have a \nsource impedance of 100Ω or less for each input. The source impedance should be matched for the differential inputs. Poor matching will result in higher even order harmonics, especially the second.\nInput Drive Circuits\nFigure 3 shows the L TC2241-12 being driven by an RF \ntransformer with a center tapped secondary. The secondary center tap is DC biased with V\nCM, setting the ADC input \nsignal at its optimum DC level. Terminating on the trans-former secondary is desirable, as this provides a common mode path for charging glitches caused by the sample and hold. Figure 3 shows a 1:1 turns ratio transformer . Other turns ratios can be used if the source impedance seen by the ADC does not exceed 100Ω for each ADC input. A disadvantage of using a transformer is the loss of low frequency response. Most small RF transformers have poor performance at frequencies below 1MHz.\nFigure 4 demonstrates the use of a differential amplifier to convert a single ended input signal into a differential input signal. The advantage of this method is that it provides low frequency input response; however , the limited gain bandwidth of most op amps will limit the SFDR at high input frequencies.\nFigure 5 shows a capacitively-coupled input circuit. The impedance seen by the analog inputs should be matched.  \nThe 25Ω resistors and 12pF capacitor on the analog inputs \nserve two purposes: isolating the drive circuitry from \nFigure 3.

For input frequen-cies higher than 100MHz, the capacitor may need to be decreased to prevent excessive signal loss.\nThe A\nIN+ and A IN– inputs each have two pins to reduce \npackage inductance. The two A IN+ and the two A IN– pins \nshould be shorted together .For input frequencies above 100MHz the input circuits of \nFigure 6, 7 and 8 are recommended. The balun transformer gives better high frequency response than a flux coupled center-tapped transformer . The coupling capacitors allow the analog inputs to be DC biased at 1.25V . In Figure 8 the series inductors are impedance matching elements that maximize the ADC bandwidth.\nReference Operation\nFigure 9 shows the L TC2241-12 reference circuitry consist-\ning of a 1.25V bandgap reference, a difference amplifier and switching and control circuit. The internal voltage reference can be configured for two pin selectable input ranges of 2V (±1V differential) or 1V (±0.5V differential). Tying the SENSE pin to V\nDD selects the 2V range; typing \nthe SENSE pin to V CM selects the 1V range.\nThe 1.25V bandgap reference serves two functions: its output provides a DC bias point for setting the common mode voltage of any external input circuitry; additionally, the reference is used with a difference amplifier to gener -\nate the differential reference levels needed by the internal ADC circuitry. An external bypass capacitor is required for the 1.25V reference output, V\nCM. This provides a high \nfrequency low impedance path to ground for internal and external circuitry.\nThe difference amplifier generates the high and low \nreference for the ADC. High speed switching circuits are connected to these outputs and they must be externally bypassed. Each output has four pins: two each of REFHA and REFHB for the high reference and two each of REFLA and REFLB for the low reference. The multiple output pins are needed to reduce package inductance. Bypass capaci-tors must be connected as shown in Figure 9.Figure 6. Recommended Front End Circuit for \nInput Frequencies Between 100MHz and 250MHz\nFigure 7.

An external reference can be used by ap-plying its output directly or through a resistor divider to SENSE. It is not recommended to drive the SENSE pin with a logic device. The SENSE pin should be tied to the appropriate level as close to the converter as possible. If the SENSE pin is driven externally, it should be bypassed to ground as close to the device as possible with a 1µF ceramic capacitor .Input Range\nThe input range can be set based on the application. \nThe 2V input range will provide the best signal-to-noise performance while maintaining excellent SFDR. The 1V input range will have better SFDR performance, but the SNR will degrade by 5dB. See the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nDriving the Encode Inputs\nThe noise performance of the L TC2241-12 can depend \non the encode signal quality as much as on the analog input. The ENC\n+/ENC– inputs are intended to be driven \ndifferentially, primarily for noise immunity from common mode noise sources. Each input is biased through a 4.8k resistor to a 1.5V bias. The bias resistors set the DC op-erating point for transformer coupled drive circuits and can set the logic threshold for single-ended drive circuits.\nAny noise present on the encode signal will result in ad-ditional aperture jitter that will be RMS summed with the inherent ADC aperture jitter . \nIn applications where jitter is critical (high input frequen-\ncies) take the following into consideration:\n1. Differential drive should be used.2. Use as large an amplitude as possible; if transformer \ncoupled use a higher turns ratio to increase the amplitude.\n3. If the ADC is clocked with a sinusoidal signal, filter the \nencode signal to reduce wideband noise.\n4. Balance the capacitance and series resistance at both \nencode inputs so that any coupled noise will appear at both inputs as common mode noise. The encode inputs have a common mode range of 1.2V to 2.0V . Each input may be driven from ground to V\nDD for single-ended drive.Figure 9.

Each half cycle must have at least 2.26ns for the ADC internal circuitry to have enough settling time for proper operation. Achieving a precise 50% duty cycle is easy with differential sinusoidal drive using a transformer or using symmetric differential logic such as PECL or LVDS. \nAn optional clock duty cycle stabilizer circuit can be used if \nthe input clock has a non 50% duty cycle. This circuit uses the rising edge of the ENC\n+ pin to sample the analog input. \nThe falling edge of ENC+ is ignored and the internal falling \nedge is generated by a phase-locked loop. The input clock duty cycle can vary from 40% to 60% and the clock duty cycle stabilizer will maintain a constant 50% internal duty cycle. If the clock is turned off for a long period of time, the duty cycle stabilizer circuit will require one hundred clock cycles for the PLL to lock onto the input clock. To use the clock duty cycle stabilizer , the MODE pin should be connected to 1/3V\nDD or 2/3V DD using external resistors.\nThe lower limit of the L TC2241-12 sample rate is determined by droop of the sample-and-hold circuits. The pipelined architecture of this ADC relies on storing analog signals on small valued capacitors. Junction leakage will discharge the capacitors. The specified minimum operating frequency for the L TC2241-12 is 1Msps.\nDIGITAL OUTPUTS\nTable 1 shows the relationship between the analog input \nvoltage, the digital data bits, and the overflow bit.Figure 11.

In the demultiplexed CMOS modes the two buses (referred to as bus A and bus B) can either be updated on alternate clock cycles (interleaved mode) or simultaneously (simultaneous mode). For details on the clock timing, refer to the timing diagrams. \nThe LVDS pin selects which digital output mode the part \nuses. This pin has a four-level logic input which should be connected to GND, 1/3V\nDD, 2/3V DD or V DD. An external \nresistor divider can be used to set the 1/3V DD or 2/3V DD \nlogic values. Table 2 shows the logic states for the LVDS pin.\nTable 2. LVDS Pin Function\nLVDS DIGITAL OUTPUT MODE\nGND Full-Rate CMOS\n1/3V DD Demultiplexed CMOS, Simultaneous Update\n2/3V DD Demultiplexed CMOS, Interleaved Update\nVDD LVDSDigital Output Buffers (CMOS Modes)\nFigure 13a shows an equivalent circuit for a single output \nbuffer in the CMOS output mode. Each buffer is powered by OV\nDD and OGND, which are isolated from the ADC \npower and ground. The additional N-channel transistor in the output driver allows operation down to voltages as low as 0.5V . The internal resistor in series with the output makes the output appear as 50Ω to external circuitry and may eliminate the need for external damping resistors.\nAs with all high speed/high resolution converters, the \ndigital output loading can affect the performance. The digital outputs of the L TC2241-12 should drive a minimal capacitive load to avoid possible interaction between the digital outputs and sensitive input circuitry. The output should be buffered with a device such as an 74VCX245 CMOS latch. For full speed operation the capacitive load should be kept under 10pF . \nLower OV\nDD voltages will also help reduce interference \nfrom the digital outputs.\nDigital Output Buffers (LVDS Mode)\nFigure 13b shows an equivalent circuit for a differential \noutput pair in the LVDS output mode. A 3.5mA current is steered from OUT\n+ to OUT– or vice versa which creates a \n±350mV differential voltage across the 100Ω termination resistor at the LVDS receiver . A feedback loop regulates the common mode output voltage to 1.25V . For proper operation each LVDS output pair needs an external 100Ω termination resistor , even if the signal is not used (such as OF\n+/OF– or CLKOUT+/CLKOUT–).  To minimize noise \nthe PC board traces for each LVDS output pair should be routed close together . To minimize clock skew all LVDS PC board traces should have about the same length.\nLTC2241-12\n21\n224112fcapplica Tions inForMaTion\nData Format\nThe L TC2241-12 parallel digital output can be selected \nfor offset binary or 2’s complement format. The format is selected with the MODE pin. Connecting MODE to GND or 1/3V\nDD selects offset binary output format. Connecting \nMODE to 2/3V DD or V DD selects 2’s complement output \nformat. An external resistor divider can be used to set the 1/3V\nDD or 2/3V DD logic values. Table 3 shows the logic \nstates for the MODE pin.\nTable 3.

In CMOS mode, a logic high on the OFA pin indicates an overflow or underflow on the A data bus, while a logic high on the OFB pin indicates an overflow or underflow on the B data bus. In LVDS mode, a differential logic high on the OF\n+/OF– pins indicates an \noverflow or underflow.\nOutput Clock\nThe ADC has a delayed version of the ENC+ input available \nas a digital output, CLKOUT . The CLKOUT pin can be used to synchronize the converter data to the digital system. \nThis is necessary when using a sinusoidal encode. In all CMOS modes, A bus data will be updated just after CLKOUTA rises and can be latched on the falling edge of CLKOUTA. In demux CMOS mode with interleaved update, B bus data will be updated just after CLKOUTB rises and can be latched on the falling edge of CLKOUTB. In demux CMOS mode with simultaneous update, B bus data will be updated just after CLKOUTB falls and can be latched on the rising edge of CLKOUTB. In LVDS mode, data will be updated just after CLKOUT\n+/CLKOUT– rises and can be \nlatched on the falling edge of CLKOUT+/CLKOUT–.\nOutput Driver Power\nSeparate output power and ground pins allow the output \ndrivers to be isolated from the analog circuitry. The power supply for the digital output buffers, OV\nDD, should be tied \nto the same power supply as for the logic being driven. For example if the converter is driving a DSP powered by a 1.8V supply then OV\nDD should be tied to that same \n1.8V supply.\nIn the CMOS output mode, OV DD can be powered with \nany voltage up to 2.625V . OGND can be powered with any \nvoltage from GND up to 1V and must be less than OV DD. \nThe logic outputs will swing between OGND and OV DD.\nIn the LVDS output mode, OV DD should be connected to \na 2.5V supply and OGND should be connected to GND.Figure 13b.

In CMOS or LVDS output modes OE high disables all data outputs including OF and CLKOUT . The data access and bus relinquish times are too slow to allow the outputs to be enabled and disabled during full speed operation. The output Hi-Z state is intended for use during long periods of inactivity. \nThe Hi-Z state is not a truly open circuit; the output pins that make an LVDS output pair have a 20k resistance be-tween them. Therefore in the CMOS output mode, adjacent data bits will have 20k resistance in between them, even in the Hi-Z state.\nSleep and Nap Modes\nThe converter may be placed in shutdown or nap modes \nto conserve power . Connecting SHDN to GND results in normal operation. Connecting SHDN to V\nDD and OE to V DD \nresults in sleep mode, which powers down all circuitry including the reference and typically dissipates 1mW . When exiting sleep mode it will take milliseconds for the output data to become valid because the reference capacitors have to recharge and stabilize. Connecting SHDN to V\nDD \nand OE to GND results in nap mode, which typically dis-\nsipates 28mW . In nap mode, the on-chip reference circuit is kept on, so that recovery from nap mode is faster than that from sleep mode, typically taking 100 clock cycles. In both sleep and nap mode all digital outputs are disabled and enter the Hi-Z state.\nGROUNDING AND BYPASSING\nThe L TC2241-12 requires a printed circuit board with a \nclean unbroken ground plane. A multilayer board with an internal ground plane is recommended. Layout for the printed circuit board should ensure that digital and analog signal lines are separated as much as possible. In particular , care should be taken not to run any digital signal alongside an analog signal or underneath the ADC.\nHigh quality ceramic bypass capacitors should be used at \nthe V\nDD, OV DD, VCM, REFHA, REFHB, REFLA and REFLB \npins. Bypass capacitors must be located as close to the pins as possible. Of particular importance are the capaci-tors between REFHA and REFLB and between REFHB and REFLA. These capacitors should be as close to the device as possible (1.5mm or less). Size 0402 ceramic capacitors are recommended. The 2.2µF capacitor between REFHA and REFLA can be somewhat further away. The traces connecting the pins and bypass capacitors must be kept short and should be made as wide as possible.\nThe L TC2241-12 differential inputs should run parallel and \nclose to each other . The input traces should be as short as possible to minimize capacitance and to minimize noise pickup.\nHEAT TRANSFER\nMost of the heat generated by the L TC2241-12 is trans-\nferred from the die through the bottom-side exposed pad and package leads onto the printed circuit board. For good electrical and thermal performance, the exposed pad should be soldered to a large grounded pad on the PC board. It is critical that all ground pins are connected to a ground plane of sufficient area.\nClock Sources for Undersampling\nUndersampling is especially demanding on the clock \nsource and the higher the input frequency, the greater the sensitivity to clock jitter or phase noise. A clock source that degrades SNR of a full-scale signal by 1dB at 70MHz will degrade SNR by 3dB at 140MHz, and 4.5dB at 190MHz.\nIn cases where absolute clock frequency accuracy is \nrelatively unimportant and only a single ADC is required, a canned oscillator from vendors such as Saronix or Vec-tron can be placed close to the ADC and simply connected directly to the ADC. If there is any distance to the ADC, some source termination to reduce ringing that may occur even over a fraction of an inch is advisable. You must not allow the clock to overshoot the supplies or performance will suffer . Do not filter the clock signal with a narrow band filter unless you have a sinusoidal clock source, as the rise and fall time artifacts present in typical digital clock signals will be translated into phase noise. \nLTC2241-12\n23\n224112fcapplica Tions inForMaTion\nThe lowest phase noise oscillators have single-ended si-\nnusoidal outputs, and for these devices the use of a filter close to the ADC may be beneficial. This filter should be close to the ADC to both reduce roundtrip reflection times, \nas well as reduce the susceptibility of the traces between the filter and the ADC. If the circuit is sensitive to close-in phase noise, the power supply for oscillators and any buffers must be very stable, or propagation delay variation with supply will translate into phase noise. Even though these clock sources may be regarded as digital devices, do not operate them on a digital supply. If your clock is also used to drive digital devices such as an FPGA, you should locate the oscillator , and any clock fan-out devices close to the ADC, and give the routing to the ADC prece-dence. The clock signals to the FPGA should have series termination at the driver to prevent high frequency noise from the FPGA disturbing the substrate of the clock fan-out device. If you use an FPGA as a programmable divider , you must re-time the signal using the original oscillator , and the re-timing flip-flop as well as the oscillator should be close to the ADC, and powered with a very quiet supply.\nFor cases where there are multiple ADCs, or where the clock source originates some distance away, differential clock distribution is advisable. This is advisable both from the perspective of EMI, but also to avoid receiving noise from digital sources both radiated, as well as propagated in the waveguides that exist between the layers of multilayer PCBs. The differential pairs must be close together and distanced from other signals. The differential pair should be guarded on both sides with copper distanced at least 3x the distance between the traces, and grounded with vias no more than 1/4 inch apart.\nLTC2241-12\n24\n224112fcapplica Tions in ForMaTionEvaluation Circuit Schematic of the L TC2241-12\nAIN+\nAIN+\nAIN–\nAIN–\nREFHA\nREFHAREFLBREFLB\nREFHB\nREFHBREFLAREFLA\nC19\n0.1µF21436587\n10\n9\n121156555453525148474645444340393837363532313029282724232221\nR17\n100ΩR3\n100Ω\nR71k\nR37\nBLM18BB470SN1DR38\n100Ω\nR39\n100Ω\nR40\n100Ω\nR42\n100Ω\nR43\n100ΩR18\n100Ω\nR19\n100Ω\nR20\n100Ω\nR21\n100Ω\nR22\n100Ω\nR28 100Ω\nR30 100Ω\n24OF+\nOF–\nD11+\nD11–\nD10+\nD10–\nD9+\nD9–\nD8+\nD8–\nD7+\nD7–\nD6+\nD6–\nD5+\nD5–\nCLKOUT+\nCLKOUT–\nD4+\nD4–\nD3+\nD3–\nD2+\nD2–\nD1+\nD1–\nD0+\nD0–L TC2241-12GND\nGNDGNDGND\nV\nDD\nVDD\nVDD\nVDD\nVDD656461166362151413C26 0.1µFC25 0.1µF\n2.5VOVDD\nOVDD\nOVDD\nOVDDOGNDOGNDOGNDOGND25334150\n26\n344249TP6\nVCMENC+ENC–\nSHDN\nOESENSEMODELVDSV\nCM\nC20 0.1µF\nC21 0.1µF\nC23 0.1µFC22 0.1µFTP1\nEXT REF\nTP2\nGNDSHDN 3\nVDD 1\nGND 54 OE \n2 VDD\n6 GND2.5V 1\nVCM 3\nEXT REF 524617\n18\n60\n19\n20 59 \n58572.5V\n2.5V\n2.5VR24\n1k\nJ4\nSENSE\n 1\nVDD 3\nGND 52\n4 2/36 1/3J2\nMODER6 1k\nR8 1k\nL T1763CDE-2.5\nIN\nIN\nSHDNVO\nVO10\n11\n8SEN2\n2 13\n5\n6BYP\nGND GP\nGP 7C38\n0.01µFC34\n0.1µFC364.7µFJ6\nAUX PWR\nCONNECTOR\nC2410µF+2.5V+3.3V\n3.3V TP5\nGND TP4\n2.5V TP3\n(NO TURRET)1\n23EN12EN34EN56EN78EN\nI\n1N\nI1P\nI2N\nI2P\nI3N\nI3P\nI4N\nI4P\nI5N\nI5P\nI6N\nI6P\nI7N\nI7P\nI8N\nI8P\nVBBO1N\nO1P\nO2N\nO2P\nO3N\nO3P\nO4N\nO4P\nO5N\nO5P\nO6N\nO6P\nO7N\nO7P\nO8N\nO8PVC1\nVC2\nVC3\nVC4\nVC512\n25264748V\nE1\nVE2\nVE3\nVE4\nVE512\n233637U3 FINII083.3V\nEN12EN34EN56EN78EN\nI\n1N\nI1P\nI2N\nI2P\nI3N\nI3P\nI4N\nI4P\nI5N\nI5P\nI6N\nI6P\nI7N\nI7P\nI8N\nI8P\nVBBO1N\nO1P\nO2N\nO2P\nO3N\nO3P\nO4N\nO4P\nO5N\nO5P\nO6N\nO6P\nO7N\nO7P\nO8N\nO8PVC1\nVC2\nVC3\nVC4\nVC512\n25264748V\nE1\nVE2\nVE3\nVE4\nVE512\n233637U3 FINII083.3V3\n22274613\n45\n6\n7\n8\n9\n1011\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n214544\n43\n42\n41\n40\n39\n38\n35\n34\n33\n32\n31\n30\n29\n28\n45\n44\n43\n42\n41\n40\n39\n38\n35\n34\n33\n32\n31\n30\n29\n283\n22274613\n45\n6\n7\n8\n9\n1011\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n242468\n10121416182022242628303234363840424446485052541357911131517192123252729313335373941434547495153\n56586062646668707274767880828486889092949698\n1005557596163656769717375777981838587899193959799\nLVDS BUFFER BYPASSC28\n0.1µF\nC290.1µF3.3V\nC300.1µF\nC310.1µFC320.1µF\nC330.1µFC50.1µF\nC80.1µFR16100k\nV\nCC24LC02ST\nGND\n4\n224112 AI018\nARRAY\nEEPROMSCL\nSDA\nWP\nA2\nA1A0657321C27\n0.1µFR46\n4990ΩR29\n4990Ω2.5V\nR26\n4990ΩR149.9Ω\nR249.9ΩR4\n4.99Ω\nR5\n4.99ΩJ7\nENCODE\nCLK\nC30.1µF C11\n0.1µFC41.8pFR41\n100ΩC13\n0.1µF\nC14\n0.1µFC15\n1µF\nC16\n1µFC17\n2.2µFR23\n100Ω\nC12\n0.1µFC91.8pFR1149.9Ω\nR12\n49.9ΩR13\n4.99Ω\nR14\n4.99ΩR9\n12.4Ω\nR10\n12.4Ω\nC18\n2.2µFC10\n0.1µFR1549.9Ω\nT2\nMABA-007159-000000R27\n49.9ΩAINC6\n0.1µFJ5\nSMA\nC2\n0.1µFC7\n0.1µF\nSMA\nC1\n0.1µFT1\nMABA-007159-000000\nVERSION DEVICE BITS  SAMPLE RATE\nDC997B-A L TC2242-12 12 250Msps\nDC997B-B L TC2241-12 12 210MspsDC997B-C L TC2240-12 12 170MspsDC997B-D L TC2242-10 10 250MspsDC997B-E L TC2241-10 10 210MspsDC997B-F L TC2240-10 10 170MspsR25\n1kU5\nSJ\nLTC2241-12\n25\n224112fcapplica Tions inForMaTion\nSilkscreen Top\nLayer 2 GND PlaneLayer 1 Component Side\n\nLTC2241-12\n26\n224112fcLayer 3 Power/Ground Plane\napplica Tions in ForMaTion\nLayer 4 Power/Ground Planes\nLayer 5 Power/Ground Planes\n\nLTC2241-12\n27\n224112fcLayer Back Solder Side Silk Screen Back, Solder Side\napplica Tions inForMaTion\nLTC2241-12\n28\n224112fc9 .00 ± 0.10\n(4 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
