The input voltage covers 2.3 V to 14 V while \nthe maximal output voltage covers up to 18.5 V. The \nswitching current limit is programmable from 1 A to \n4.8 A. The device consumes 25- μA quiescent current \nfrom V IN.\nThe TPS61378-Q1 employs peak current mode \ncontrol with the switching frequency programmable \nfrom 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz. The device works in \nfixed frequency PWM operation in medium to heavy \nloads. There are two optional modes in light load \nby configuring the MODE pin: auto PFM mode and \nforced PWM to balance the efficiency and noise \nimmunity in light load. The switching frequency can be \nsynchronized to an external clock. The TPS61378-Q1 \nuses the spread spectrum of the internal clock to be \nmore EMI friendly at FPWM mode. In addition, there \nis an internal soft-start time to limit the inrush current.\nThe TPS61378-Q1 has various fixed output voltage \nversions to save the external feedback resistor. It \nsupports the external loop compensation so that the \nstability and transient response can be optimized \nat wider V OUT/VIN ranges. It also integrates robust \nprotection features including output short protection, \noutput overvoltage protection, and thermal shutdown \nprotection. The TPS61378-Q1 is available in a 3-mm \n× 3-mm 16-pin QFN package with wettable flank.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS61378-Q1 VQFN-16 3.0-mm × 3.0-mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nSW\nVIN\nENBST\nFREQ\nCOMP\nGNDFBVOVIN L1\nC1\nC4\nR4OUT\nC3\nVOUTC2\nR3\nMODE/SYNCPG\nR6\nR2\nC5C6VCC\nILIM\nR5R1\nTPS61378-Q1\nTypical ApplicationTPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D  – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

It supports \noutput voltage up to 18.5 V with a maximum of a 4.8-A programmable switching peak current limit. The input \nvoltage ranges from 2.3 V to 14 V while consuming 25-µA quiescent current.\nThe TPS61378-Q1 utilizes the fixed-frequency peak current control scheme, which has an internal oscillator and \nsupports adjustable switching frequency from 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz.\nThe TPS61378-Q1 operates with fixed-frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) from medium to heavy load. At \nthe beginning of each switching cycle, the low-side N-MOSFET switch is turned on. The inductor current ramps \nup to a peak current that is determined by the output of the internal error amplifier (EA). Once the switching \npeak current triggers the output of the EA, the low-side N-MOSFET is turned off and the high-side N-MOSFET \nis turned on after a short dead time. The high-side N-MOSFET switch is not turned off until the next cycle \nas determined by the internal oscillator. The low-side switch turns on again after a short dead time and the \nswitching cycle is repeated.\nThe TPS61378-Q1 provides either auto PFM or forced PWM for the light load operation by configuring the \nMODE/SYNC pin. In forced PWM mode, the switching frequency remains constant across the entire load range, \nwhich helps avoid frequency variation with load. The internal oscillator can be synchronized to an external clock \napplied on the MODE/SYNC pin. Spread spectrum modulation of the frequency in forced PWM mode helps \noptimize the EMI performance for automotive applications. In auto PFM mode, the switching frequency can \ndecrease, resulting in higher efficiency.\nThe TPS61378-Q1 implements a cycle-by-cycle current limit to protect the device from overload during the boost \noperation phase. If the output current further increases and triggers the output voltage to fall below the input \nvoltage, the TPS61378-Q1 enters into hiccup mode short protection.\nThere is a built-in soft-start time, which prevents the inrush current during the start-up. The TPS61378-Q1 also \nprovides a power good (PG) indicator to enable the power sequence control for start-up.\nThe TPS61378-Q1 also has a number of protection features including output short protection, output overvoltage \nprotection (OVP), and thermal shutdown protection (OTP).www.ti.comTPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nS\nRQ\nGmVref\nFBBST\nSWVOSW BSTL1\nVIN\nHS\nLSLogic\nULVO\nOVP\nSCP\nCOMPCOMP\nSlope CompensationCLK\nFREQOSC\nSYNC\nMODELDO\n& BIAS\nDitheringENVCC\nVCC\nGNDC1\nVOUT\nOTPCOMPVUVLO\nCOMP\nCOMPVOUTVOVP\nTempVOTPOVP\nOTPSoft\nStart\nR41/KC2\nC4\nMODE\n1/NC6\nCLIM\nR3VCCISO\nMODE/\nSYNCOUT\nR2\nC5CLIM\nILIM\nR5OUT\nMODEVO Voltage \nSELECT\nCurrent Limit SELECTFrequency \nSELECTC3VIN\nCOMPPGR6\nR1\nPGOODFixed\nOutput\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 VCC Power Supply\nThe internal LDO in the TPS61378-Q1 outputs a regulated voltage of 4.8 V with 10-mA output current capability. \nA ceramic capacitor is connected between the VCC pin and GND pin to stabilize the VCC voltage and also \ndecouple the noise on the VCC pin. The value of this ceramic capacitor should be above 1 µF. A ceramic \ncapacitor with an X7R or X5R grade dielectric with a voltage rating higher than 10 V is recommended.\n8.3.2 Input Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nAn undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit stops the operation of the converter when the input voltage drops below \nthe UVLO threshold of 2.04 V (typical). A hysteresis of 160 mV (typical) is added so that the device cannot be \nenabled again until the input voltage exceeds 2.2 V (typical). This function is implemented to prevent the device \nfrom malfunctioning when the input voltage is between 2.04 V and 2.2 V.\n8.3.3 Enable and Soft Start\nWhen the input voltage is above the UVLO threshold and the EN pin is pulled above 1.2 V, the TPS61378-Q1 \nis enabled. The device starts to monitor the FB pin. With a typical 400-µs delay time after EN is pulled high, \nthe TPS61378-Q1 starts switching. There is an internal built-in start-up time, typically 2.5 ms, to limit the inrush \ncurrent during start-up.TPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\n8.3.4 Shut Down\nWhen the input voltage is below the UVLO threshold or the EN pin is pulled low, the TPS61378-Q1 is in \nshutdown mode and all the functions are disabled. The input voltage is isolated from the output to minimize the \nleakage currents.\n8.3.5 Switching Frequency Setting\nThe TPS61378-Q1 uses a fixed-frequency control scheme. The switching frequency can be programmed \nbetween 200 kHz and 2.2 MHz using a resistor from the FREQ pin to GND. The resistor must be connected \nwhen the oscillator is synchronized by an external clock. The resistance is defined by Equation 1 .\n(59(/*V)=41.9\n4(4\'3:GÀ;+1.05 \n(1)\nwhere\n•RFREQ is the resistance between the FREQ pin and the GND pin\nFor example, the switching frequency is 2.2 MHz if the resistance between the FREQ pin and GND is 18 k Ω. \nThis pin cannot be left floating or tied to VCC.\n8.3.6 Spread Spectrum Frequency Modulation\nThe TPS61378-Q1 uses a triangle waveform to spread the switching frequency with ±10% of normal frequency. \nThe frequency of the triangle waveform is typically 0.4% of the switching frequency. For example, if the normal \nswitching frequency of the TPS61378-Q1 is programmed to 2.2 MHz, the spread spectrum function modulates \nthe switching frequency in the range of 1.98 MHz to 2.42 MHz in a triangle behavior with an 8.8-kHz rate.\nThe spread spectrum is only available while the clock of the TPS61378-Q1 is free running at its natural \nfrequency. Any of the following conditions overrides spread spectrum, turning it off:\n•An external clock is applied to the MODE/SYNC pin.\n•The device works in PFM operation at light load.\n8.3.7 Adjustable Peak Current Limit\nThe TPS61378-Q1 adopts a cycle-by-cycle peak current limit internally. The low-side switch is turned off \nimmediately as soon as the switch peak current triggers the limit threshold. The peak switch current limit can be \nset by a resistor from the ILIM pin to ground. The relationship between the current limit and the resistor is shown \nin Equation 2 .\n\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0cLIM\nLIM90.56R k 1.184I A :  \x0e\n(2)\nwhere\n•RILIM is the resistance between the ILIM pin and the GND pin\n•ILIM is switch peak current limit\nFor instance, the current limit is set to 4.8 A if the R LIM is 20 k Ω. This pin cannot be left floating or connected to \nVCC.\n8.3.8 Bootstrap\nThe TPS61378-Q1 has an integrated bootstrap regulator circuit. A small ceramic capacitor is needed between \nthe BST pin and SW pin to provide the gate drive supply voltage for high-side switches. The bootstrap capacitor \nis charged during the time when the low-side switch is in the ON state. The value of this ceramic capacitor \nshould be above 0.1 µF. A ceramic capacitor with an X7R or X5R grade dielectric with a voltage rating higher \nthan 6.3 V is recommended.\n8.3.9 Load Disconnect\nThe TPS61378-Q1 integrates a load disconnect function when the input source is DC, completely cutting off the \npath between the input side and output side during shutdown.www.ti.comTPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\nThe output disconnect function also allows the output short protection and minimizes the inrush current at \nstart-up.\n8.3.10 MODE/SYNC Configuration\nTable 8-1  summarizes the MODE/SYNC function and the entry condition.\nTable 8-1. MODE/SYNC Configuration\nMODE/SYNC PIN CONFIGURATION MODE\nLogic Low or Floating Auto PFM Mode\nLogic High Forced PWM Mode\nExternal Synchronization Forced PWM Mode\nThe TPS61378-Q1 can be synchronized to an external clock applied to the MODE/SYNC pin.\n8.3.11 Overvoltage Protection (OVP)\nIf the output voltage exceeds the OVP threshold (typically 20 V), the TPS61378-Q1 immediately stops switching \nuntil the output voltage drops below the recovery threshold (typically 19.5 V). This function protects the device \nagainst excessive voltage.\n8.3.12 Output Short Protection/Hiccup\nIn addition to the cycle-by-cycle current limit function, the TPS61378-Q1 also has output short protection. If \nthe output current causes the low-side FET to reach current limit and pull the output voltage below the input \nvoltage, the device enters into short circuit protection mode, triggering the hiccup timer. When the hiccup timer is \ntriggered, the device limits the current to a relative lower level for 1.8 ms and then shuts down. After 67 ms, it will \nrestart. If the short condition disappears, the device will automatically restart.\nWhen FB voltage is below ≤ 0.1 V during fault condition, the current limit threshold is reduced to 1/5 of the \nprogrammed current limit. Frequency is clamped to 1.1 MHz if the FREQ pin setting is greater than 1.1 MHz.\n8.3.13 Power-Good Indicator\nThe TPS61378-Q1 integrates a power-good function. The power-good output consists of an open-drain NMOS, \nrequiring an external pullup resistor connect to a suitable voltage supply like VCC. The PG pin goes high with a \ntypical 3.4-ms delay time after VOUT reaches 90% of the target output voltage. When the output voltage drops \nbelow 85% of the target output voltage, the PG pin immediately goes low without delay.\n8.3.14 Thermal Shutdown\nA thermal shutdown is implemented to prevent damage due to excessive heat and power dissipation. Typically, \nthe thermal shutdown occurs at junction temperatures exceeding 165°C. When the thermal shutdown is \ntriggered, the device stops switching and recovers when the junction temperature falls below 145°C (typical).\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Forced PWM Mode\nThe TPS61378-Q1 enters forced PWM mode by pulling the MODE/SYNC pin to logic high for more than five \nswitching cycles. In forced PWM mode, the TPS61378-Q1 keeps the switching frequency constant at light load \ncondition. When the load current decreases, the output of the internal error amplifier also decreases to keep the \ninductor peak current down. When the output current decreases further, the high-side switch is not turned off \neven if the current of the high-side switch goes negative to keep the frequency constant.\n8.4.2 Auto PFM Mode\nThe TPS61378-Q1 enters auto PFM Mode by pulling the MODE/SYNC pin to logic low for more than five \nswitching cycles or leaving the pin floating. The TPS61378-Q1 improves the efficiency at light load when \noperating in PFM mode. When the output current decreases to a certain level, the output voltage of the error \namplifier is clamped by the internal circuit. If the output current reduces further, the inductor current through the \nhigh-side switch will be clamped but not lowered further. Pulses are skipped to improve the efficiency at light \nload.TPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\n8.4.3 External Clock Synchronization\nThe TPS61378-Q1 supports external clock synchronization with a range of 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz. The TPS61378-\nQ1 remains in forced PWM mode and operates in CCM across the entire load range if the oscillator is \nsynchronized by an external clock. The spread spectrum feature is disabled when external synchronization \nis used.\n8.4.4 Down Mode\nThe TPS61378-Q1 features down mode operation when input voltage is close to or higher than output voltage. \nIn down mode, output voltage is regulated at target value, even when V IN > V O. The TPS61378-Q1 high-side \nand low-side FETs are switching devices that always work in boost operation, where the isolation FET always \nworks as a linear device.\nFor boost circuits, on-time or duty cycle is reduced as input voltage approaches output voltage. The TPS61378-\nQ1 enters down mode when V IN reaches 85% (typical) of V O voltage at 2.2 MHz. Exiting down mode requires \nVIN to be reduced below 85% (typical) of V O voltage at 2.2 MHz.\nIn normal operation, the isolation FET is fully on.\nWhen down mode is triggered and V IN is less than VO pin voltage, the OUT pin has a fixed 2 V (typical) above \nVO pin voltage. An isolation FET works in LDO mode to regulate VO pin voltage with a 2-V constant voltage \ndrop.\nWhen down mode is triggered and V IN is 100 mV (typical) higher than VO pin voltage, the OUT pin has an \napproximated 3 V (typical) above the V IN pin voltage. As V IN keeps rising, the OUT pin continues rising with \n3 V on top of V IN. In addition, an isolation FET works in LDO mode to regulate VO pin voltage with a voltage \ndifferential of the OUT pin and VO pin.\nRefer to Figure 8-1 .\nTVoltage\nVINVOOUTDown Mode \nEntering \nThresholdVin > VoVin < Vo\nDown Mode \nExiting \nThreshold\nFigure 8-1. Down Mode\nTake care during short-to-ground condition when operation V IN is above 6 V. During hiccup on, the device \noperates in down mode and the isolation FET voltage drop is V IN + 3 V (OUT pin to VO pin).www.ti.comTPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe TPS61378-Q1 is a 25-µA quiescent current boost converter that supports a 2.3-V to 14-V input voltage \nrange. The device also supports load disconnect to minimize the leakage current.

Typical Application\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nA typical application example is dual cameras powered through a coax cable, which normally requires 9.0-V \noutput as its bias voltage and consumes less than 600 mA current. 800-mA load current is designed to provide \nmargin. The following design procedure can be used to select external component values for the TPS61378-Q1.\nTable 9-1.

If the resistance between \nFB and GND is higher than 14.4 k Ω and less than 100k Ω during start-up, the TPS61378-Q1 works as an \nadjustable output version. The FB pin is connected to the negative input of the internal error amplifier directly. \nThe output voltage can be programmed by adjusting the external resistor divider R Upper and R Lower according to \nEquation 3 . When the output voltage is in well regulation, the typical voltage at the FB pin is V REF of 0.8 V.TPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\n8176=84\'(×(47LLAN+4.KSAN)\n4.KSAN (3)\nFor some applications where the resistor needs to be as low as possible, the low-side divider can be 20 k Ω. The \nreference voltage is 0.8 V and the high-side divider is 205 kΩ for 9-V output voltage.\nFor other applications without specific requirements on divider resistance, you can choose R Lower to be \napproximately 80.6 k Ω. Slightly increasing or decreasing R Lower can result in closer output voltage matching \nwhen using standard values resistors.\nFor the best accuracy, R Lower is recommended to be smaller than 100 k Ω to ensure that the current flowing \nthrough R Lower is at least 100 times larger than FB pin leakage current. Changing R Lower towards the lower \nvalue increases the robustness against noise injection. Changing R Lower to higher values reduces the quiescent \ncurrent to achieve higher efficiency at light load.\nIf the resistance between FB and GND is less than 9.6k Ω during start-up, the TPS61378-Q1 works as a fixed \noutput voltage version. The TPS61378-Q1 uses the internal resistor divider.\nFor 5-V fixed output voltage, R Lower is between 0Ω and 2.4kΩ and R Upper should be removed.\nFor 5.25-V fixed output voltage, R Lower is between 3.6kΩ and 4.8 kΩ and R Upper should be removed.\nFor 5.5-V fixed output voltage, R Lower is between 7.2kΩ and 9.6kΩ and R Upper should be removed.\n9.2.2.2 Setting the Switching Frequency\nThe switching frequency of the TPS61378-Q1 is set at 2.2 MHz. Use Equation 1  to calculate the required resistor \nvalue. The calculated value is 18 kΩ to get the frequency of 2.2 MHz.\n9.2.2.3 Setting the Current Limit\nThe current limit of the TPS61378-Q1 can be programmed by an external resistor. For a target current limit of 4.8 \nA, use Equation 2 . The calculated resistor value is 20 kΩ.\n9.2.2.4 Selecting the Inductor\nA boost converter normally requires two main passive components for storing energy during power conversion: \nan inductor and an output capacitor. The inductor affects the steady state efficiency (including the ripple and \nefficiency), transient behavior, and loop stability, which makes the inductor the most critical component in \napplication.\nWhen selecting the inductor and the inductance, the other important parameters are:\n•The maximum current rating (RMS and peak current should be considered)\n•The series resistance\n•Operating temperature\nThe TPS61378-Q1 has built-in slope compensation to avoid subharmonic oscillation associated with current \nmode control. If the inductor value is too low and makes the inductor peak-to-peak ripple higher than 2 A, the \nslope compensation may not be adequate, and the loop can be unstable. Therefore, it is recommended to make \nthe peak-to-peak current ripple between 800 mA to 2 A when selecting the inductor.\nThe inductance can be calculated by Equation 4 , Equation 5 , and Equation 6 :\nIN\nL\nSWV DIL f/c180/c68 /c61/c180\n(4)\nOUT OUT\nL _R\nINV II Ripple%V/c180/c68 /c61 /c180/c104 /c180\n(5)\nIN IN\nOUT OUT SWV V D 1LRipple % V I ƒ/c104 /c180 /c180/c61 /c180 /c180/c180\n(6)www.ti.comTPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\nwhere\n•ΔIL is the peak-peak inductor current ripple\n•VIN is the input voltage\n•D is the duty cycle\n•L is the inductor\n•ƒSW is the switching frequency\n•Ripple % is the ripple ration versus the DC current\n•VOUT is the output voltage\n•IOUT is the output current\n•η is the efficiency\nThe current flowing through the inductor is the inductor ripple current plus the average input current.

When the inductor current \napproaches the saturation level, the inductance can decrease 20% to 35% from the value at 0-A bias current, \ndepending on how the inductor vendor defines saturation. When selecting an inductor, make sure the rated \ncurrent, especially the saturation current, is larger than its peak current during the operation.\nThe inductor peak current varies as a function of the load, switching frequency, and input and output voltages. \nThe peak current can be calculated with Equation 7  and Equation 8 .\nPEAK IN L1I I I2/c61 /c43 /c180 /c68\n(7)\nwhere\n•IPEAK is the peak current of the inductor\n•IIN is the input average current\n•ΔIL is the ripple current of the inductor\nThe input DC current is determined by the output voltage.

Assuming a capacitor with zero ESR, the minimum \ncapacitance needed for a given ripple can be calculated by Equation 11 :\nOUT OUT IN\nOUT\nSW OUTI (V V )Cf V V/c180 /c45/c61/c180 /c68 /c180\n(11)\nwhere\n•COUT is the output capacitor\n•IOUT is the output current\n•VOUT is the output voltage\n•VIN is the input voltage\n•ΔV is the output voltage ripple required\n•ƒSW is the switching frequency\nThe additional output ripple component caused by ESR is calculated by Equation 12 :www.ti.comTPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\nESR OUT ESRV I R/c68 /c61 /c180(12)\nwhere\n•ΔVESR is the output voltage ripple caused by ESR\n•RESR is the resistor in series with the output capacitor\nFor the ceramic capacitor, the ESR ripple can be neglected. However, for the tantalum or electrolytic capacitors, \nit must be considered if used.\nThe minimum ceramic output capacitance needed to meet a load transient requirement can be estimated using \nEquation 13 :\nSTEP\nOUT\nBW TRANIC2 f V/c68/c61/c112 /c180 /c180 /c68\n(13)\nwhere\n•ΔISTEP is the transient load current step\n•ΔVTRAN is the allowed voltage dip for the load current step\n•ƒBW is the control loop bandwidth (that is, the frequency where the control loop gain crosses zero)\nFor the output capacitor on the OUT pin, the effective capacitance is recommended between 0.22 μF to 1 μF.\nTake care when evaluating the derating of a ceramic capacitor under the DC bias. Ceramic capacitors can \nderate by as much as 70% of the capacitance at the respective rated voltage. Therefore, enough margins on the \nvoltage rating must be considered to ensure adequate capacitance at the required output voltage.\n9.2.2.6 Selecting the Input Capacitors\nMultilayer ceramic capacitors are an excellent choice for the input decoupling of the step-up converter since \nthey have extremely low ESR and are available in small footprints. Input capacitors must be located as close as \npossible to the device. While a 22-µF input capacitor or equivalent is sufficient for the most applications, larger \nvalues can be used to reduce input current ripple.\nTake care when using only ceramic input capacitors. When a ceramic capacitor is used at the input and the \npower is being supplied through long wires, such as from a wall adapter, a load step at the output can induce \nringing at the VIN pin. This ringing can couple to the output and be mistaken as loop instability or can even \ndamage the device. Additional "bulk" capacitance (electrolytic or tantalum) in this circumstance, must be placed \nbetween C IN and the power source lead to reduce ringing that can occur between the inductance of the power \nsource leads and C IN.\n9.2.2.7 Loop Stability and Compensation\n9.2.2.7.1 Small Signal Model\nThe TPS61378-Q1 uses the fixed frequency peak current mode control. There is an internal adaptive slope \ncompensation to avoid subharmonic oscillation. With the inductor current information sensed, the small-signal \nmodel of the power stage reduces from a two-pole system, created by L and C OUT, to a single-pole system, \ncreated by R OUT and C OUT. The single-pole system is easily used with the loop compensation.

The higher the crossover frequency, the faster \nthe loop response is. It is generally accepted that the loop gain crosses over no higher than the lower of \neither 1/10 of the switching frequency, ƒ SW, or 1/5 of the RHPZ frequency, ƒ RHPZ. Then, calculate the loop \ncompensation network values of R C, CC, and C P by the following equations.\n2.Set the Compensation Resistor, R C.\nBy placing ƒ Z below ƒ C, for frequencies above ƒ C, RC | | R EA ~ = R C, so R C × G EA sets the compensation \ngain. Setting the compensation gain, K COMP-dB , at ƒ Z results in the total loop gain, T (s) = K PS(s) × H EA(s), \nbeing zero at ƒ C.\nTherefore, to approximate a single-pole rolloff up to f P2, rearrange Equation 18  to solve for RC so that the \ncompensation gain, K EA, at f C is the negative of the gain, K PS.

The gate current also supplies charge for the bootstrap capacitor. \nThe recommended value of the bootstrap capacitor is 0.1 µF to 1 µF. C BST must be a good quality, low-ESR \nceramic capacitor located at the pins of the device to minimize potentially damaging voltage transients caused \nby trace inductance. A value of 0.1 µF was selected for this design example.\n9.2.2.7.4 VCC Capacitor\nThe primary purpose of the V CC capacitor is to supply the peak transient currents of the driver and bootstrap \ncapacitor and provide stability for the V CC regulator. The value of C VCC must be at least 10 times greater than the \nvalue of C BST, and must be a good quality, low-ESR ceramic capacitor. C VCC must be placed close to the pins \nof the IC to minimize potentially damaging voltage transients caused by the trace inductance. A value of 2.2 µF \nwas selected for this design example.www.ti.comTPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 9-3.

This input \nsupply must be well regulated. If the input supply is located more than a few inches from the device, the bulk \ncapacitance can be required in addition to the ceramic bypass capacitors. An electrolytic capacitor with a value \nof 47 µF is a typical choice.www.ti.comTPS61378-Q1\nSLVSET0D – MAY 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TPS61378-Q1\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nAs for all switching power supplies, the layout is an important step in the design, especially at high peak currents \nand high switching frequencies. If the layout is not carefully done, the regulator can show stability problems as \nwell as EMI problems. Therefore, use wide and short traces for the main current path and for the power ground \npaths. The input and output capacitor, as well as the inductor must be placed as close as possible to the IC.\n11.2 Layout Example\nThe bottom layer is a large GND plane connected by vias.\n \n \nVINGND\nGNDGND\nVO\nSWSWSWVIN\nBST\nVOOUTILIM\nPGMODE\n/SYNC\nVCC\nGND\nGNDFREQ\nEN\nCOMP\nFB\n \n GND\nGND\nFigure 11-1.
