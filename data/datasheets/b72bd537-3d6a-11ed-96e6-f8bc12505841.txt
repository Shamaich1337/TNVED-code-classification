See "Design Revisioning," page 8  for details.\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 2R\nWhen the FPGA is in Master Serial mode, it generates a \nconfiguration clock that drives the PROM. With CF  High, a \nshort access time after CE  and OE are enabled, data is \navailable on the PROM DATA (D0) pin that is connected to the FPGA DIN pin. New data is available a short access time after each rising clock edge. The FPGA generates the appropriate number of clock pulses to complete the configuration.\nWhen the FPGA is in Slave Serial mode, the PROM and the \nFPGA are both clocked by an external clock source, or optionally, for the XCFxxP PROM only, the PROM can be used to drive the FPGA’s configuration clock.\nThe XCFxxP version of the Platform Flash PROM also \nsupports Master SelectMAP and Slave SelectMAP (or Slave Parallel) FPGA configuration modes. When the FPGA is in Master SelectMAP mode, the FPGA generates a configuration clock that drives the PROM. When the FPGA is in Slave SelectMAP Mode, ei ther an external oscillator \ngenerates the configuration clock that drives the PROM and \nthe FPGA, or optionally, the XCFxxP PROM can be used to drive the FPGA’s configuration clock. With BUSY Low and CF\n High, after CE  and OE are enabled, data is available on \nthe PROMs DATA (D0-D7) pins. New data is available a short access time after each rising clock edge. The data is \nclocked into the FPGA on the following rising edge of the CCLK. A free-running  oscillator can be used in the Slave \nParallel/Slave SelectMAP mode.\nThe XCFxxP version of the Platform Flash PROM provides \nadditional advanced features. A built-in data decompressor supports utilizing compressed  PROM files, and design \nrevisioning allows multiple design revisions to be stored on a single PROM or stored across several PROMs. For design revisioning, external pins or internal control bits are used to select the active design revision.\nMultiple Platform Flash PROM devices can be cascaded to \nsupport the larger configuration files required when targeting larger FPGA devices or targeting multiple FPGAs \ndaisy chained together. Wh en utilizing the advanced \nfeatures for the XCFxxP Platform Flash PROM, such as design revisioning, programming files which span cascaded PROM devices can only be created for cascaded chains \ncontaining only XCFxxP PROMs. If the advanced XCFxxP \nfeatures are not enabled, then the cascaded chain can include both XCFxxP and XCFxxS PROMs.X-Ref Target - Figure 1\nFigure 1: XCFxxS Platform Flash PROM Block Diagram\nX-Ref Target - Figure 2FI\nFigure 2: XCFxxP Platform Flash PROM Block DiagramControl\nand\nJTAG\nInterfaceMemorySerial\nInterface\nDATA (D0)\nSerial ModeData\nAddressCLK CE\nTCK\nTMS\nTDI\nTDOOE/RESET\nCEO\nData\nds123_01_30603 CF\nCLKOUT\nCEODATA (D0)\n(Serial/Parallel Mode)\nD[1:7]\n(Parallel Mode)TCK\nTM S\nTDITDOCLK CE EN_EXT_ SEL OE/RE SET BU SY\nDataData\nAddre ss\nREV_ SEL [1:0]\nCFControl\nand\nJTAG\nInterf aceMemoryOSC\nSerial\nor \nParallel\nInterf aceDecompre ssor\nDS123_19_0 3190 8\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 3R\nSee UG161 , Platform Flash PROM User Guide , for detailed \nguidelines on PROM-to-FPGA configuration hardware connections, for software usage,  for a reference list of Xilinx \nFPGAs, and for the respective compatible Platform Flash PROMs. Table 2  lists the Platform Flash PROMs and their \ncapacities.\nProgramming\nThe Platform Flash PROM is a reprogrammable NOR flash device (refer "Quality and Reliabilit y Characteristics," \npage 14  for the program/erase specifications). \nReprogramming requires an erase followed by a program operation. A verify operation is recommended after the program operation to validate the correct transfer of data from the programmer source to the Platform Flash PROM.\nSeveral programming solutions are available.\nIn-System Programming\nIn-System Programmable PROMs can be programmed \nindividually, or two or more can be daisy-chained together and programmed in-system vi a the standard 4-pin JTAG \nprotocol as shown in Figure 3 . \nIn-system programming offers quick and efficient design \niterations and eliminates unnecessary package handling or socketing of devices. The programming data sequence is delivered to the device using either Xilinx iMPACT software \nand a Xilinx download cabl e, a third-party JTAG \ndevelopment system, a JTAG-compatible board tester, or a simple microprocessor interface that emulates the JTAG instruction sequence. The iMPACT software also outputs \nserial vector format (SVF) files for use with any tools that accept SVF format, including automatic test equipment. During in-system programming, the CEO\n output is driven \nHigh. All other outputs are held in a high-impedance state or held at clamp levels during in-system programming. All non-JTAG input pins are ignored during in-system programming, includ ing CLK, CE, CF, OE/RESET, BUSY, \nEN_EXT_SEL, and REV_SEL[1: 0]. In-system programming \nis fully supported across the recommended operating voltage and temperature ranges.\nEmbedded, in-system programming reference designs, \nsuch as X\nAPP058 , Xilinx In-System Progr amming Using an \nEmbedded Microcontroller , are available on the Xilinx web \npage for PROM Programming and Data Storage Application \nNotes . See UG161 , Platform Flash PROM User Guide,  for \nan advanced update methodology that uses the Design Revisioning feature in the Platform Flash XCFxxP PROMs.\nOE/RESET\nThe 1/2/4 Mb XCFxxS Platform Flash PROMs in-system programming algorithm results in issuance of an internal device reset that  causes OE/RESET\n to pulse Low.\nExternal Programming\nIn traditional manufacturing environments, third-party \ndevice programmers can program Platform Flash PROMs with an initial memory image  before the PROMs are \nassembled onto boards. Contact a preferred third-party programmer vendor for Platform Flash PROM support information. A sample list of third-party programmer \nvendors with Platform Flash PROM support is available on the Xilinx web page for T\nhird-Party Programmer Device \nSupport . See UG161 , Platform Flash PROM User Guide , \nfor the PROM data file format required for programmers.\nPre-programmed PROMs can be assembled onto boards \nusing the typical soldering process guidelines in UG112 , \nDevice Package User Guide . A pre-programmed PROM’s \nmemory image can be updated after board assembly using an in-system programming solution.\nReliability and Endurance\nXilinx in-system programma ble products provide a \nguaranteed endurance level of 20,000 in-system program-erase cycles and a mini mum data retention of 20 \nyears. Each device meets all functional, performance, and data retention specifications within this endurance limit. \nSee UG116\n, Xilinx Device Reliability Report,  for device \nquality, reliability, and process node information.Table  2: Platform Flash PROM Capacity\nPlatform \nFlash PROMConfiguration \nBitsPlatform \nFlash PROMConfiguration \nBits\nXCF01S 1,048,576 XCF08P 8,388,608XCF02S 2,097,152 XCF16P 16,777,216\nXCF04S 4,194,304 XCF32P 33,554,432\nX-Ref Target - Figure 3\nFigure 3: JTAG In-System Programming Operation \n(a) Solder Device to PCB \n(b) Program Using Download CableDS123_33_03190 8GNDVCC\n(a) (b)\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 4R\nDesign Security\nThe Xilinx in-system programm able Platform Flash PROM \ndevices incorporate advanced data security features to fully protect the FPGA programming data against unauthorized reading via JTAG. The XCFxxP PROMs can also be programmed to prevent inadvertent writing via JTAG. Table 3  and Table 4  show the security settings available for \nthe XCFxxS PROM and XCFxxP PROM, respectively.\nRead Protection\nThe read protect security bit can be set by the user to prevent the internal programming pattern from being read or copied via JTAG. Read protection does not prevent write operations. For the XCFxxS PROM, the read protect security bit is set for the entire device, and resetting the read protect security bit requires erasing the entire device. For the XCFxxP PROM the read protect security bit can be set for individual design revisions, and resetting the read protect bit requires erasing the particular design revision.Write Protection\nThe XCFxxP PROM device also allows the user to write protect (or lock) a particular design revision or PROM option settings. Write protection helps to prevent an inadvertent JTAG instruction from modifying an area by write protecting the area and by locking the erase instruction. The write-protection setting can be cleared by erasing the protected area. However, an XSC_UNLOCK instruction must first be \nissued to the XCFxxP PROM to unlock the ISC_ERASE instruction. Refer to the XCFxxP PROM BSDL file for the XSC_UNLOCK and ISC_ERASE instructions.\nCaution!\nThe iMPACT software always issues a \nXSC_UNLOCK when performing an Erase operation on an \nXCFxxP PROM and, thus , always unlocks the write \nprotection.\nTable  3: XCFxxS Device Data Security Options\nRead ProtectRead/Verify \nInhibitedProgram \nInhibitedErase \nInhibited\nReset (default)\nSet \uf050\nTable  4: XCFxxP Design Revision Data Security Options\nRead Protect Write ProtectRead/Verify \nInhibitedProgram Inhibited Erase Inhibited\nReset (default) Reset (default)\nReset (default) Set \uf050\uf050\nSet Reset (default) \uf050\nSet Set \uf050\uf050\uf050\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 5R\nIEEE 1149.1 Boundary-Scan (JTAG)\nThe Platform Flash PROM family is compatible with the IEEE \n1149.1 Boundary-Scan standard and the IEEE 1532 in-\nsystem configuration standard. A Test Access Port (TAP) and \nregisters are provided to support all required Boundary-Scan instructions, as well as many of the optional instructions \nspecified by IEEE Std. 1149.1. In addition, the JTAG interface \nis used to implement in-system programming (ISP) to facilitate configuration, erasure, and verification operations on the \nPlatform Flash PROM device. Table 5  lists the required and \noptional Boundary-Scan instructions supported in the Platform Flash PROMs. Refer to the IEEE Std. 1149.1 \nspecification for a complete description of Boundary-Scan \narchitecture and the required and optional instructions.\nCaution!\nThe XCFxxP JTAG TAP pause states are not fully \ncompliant with the JTAG 1149.1 s pecification. If a temporary \npause of a JTAG shift operatio n is required, then stop the \nJTAG TCK clock and maintain the JTAG TAP within the JTAG \nShift-IR or Shift-DR TAP state.  Do not transition the XCFxxP \nJTAG TAP through the JTAG Pa use-IR or Pause-DR TAP state \nto temporarily pause a JTAG shift operation.\nInstruction Register\nThe Instruction Register (IR) for the Platform Flash PROM \nis connected between TDI and TDO during an instruction \nscan sequence. In preparation for an instruction scan sequence, the instruction register is parallel loaded with a \nfixed instruction capture pattern. This pattern is shifted out \nonto TDO (LSB first), while an in struction is shifted into the \ninstruction register from TDI.\nXCFxxS Instruction Register (8 bits wide)\nThe Instruction Register (IR) for the XCFxxS PROM is eight bits wide and is connected between TDI and TDO during an instruction scan sequence. The detailed composition of the \ninstruction capture pattern is illustrated in Table 6, page 6 . \nThe instruction capture pattern shifted out of the XCFxxS device includes IR[7:0]. IR[7:5] are reserved bits and are set \nto a logic 0. The ISC Status field, IR[4], contains logic 1 if \nthe device is currently in In-System Configuration (ISC) mode; otherwise, it contains logic 0. The Security field, \nIR[3], contains logic 1 if the device has been programmed \nwith the security option turned on; otherwise, it contains logic 0. IR[2] is unused, and is set to \'0\'. The remaining bits \nIR[1:0] are set to \'01\' as defined by IEEE Std. 1149.1.XCFxxP Instruction Register (16 bits wide)\nThe Instruction Register (IR) fo r the XCFxxP PROM is sixteen \nbits wide and is connected between TDI and TDO during an instruction scan sequence. The detailed composition of the \ninstruction capture pattern is illustrated in Table 7, page 6 .\nThe instruction capture pattern shifted out of the XCFxxP \ndevice includes IR[15:0]. IR[15:9] are reserved bits and are set \nto a logic 0. The ISC Error field, IR[8:7], contains a 10 when an \nISC operation is a success; otherwise a 01 when an In-System \nConfiguration (ISC) operation fails. The Erase/Program \n(ER/PROG) Error field, IR[6:5], contains a 10 when an erase \nor program operation is a success; otherwise a 01 when an \nerase or program operation fails. The Erase/Program \n(ER/PROG) Status field, IR[4], contains a logic 0 when the \ndevice is busy performing an erase or programming operation; otherwise, it contains a logic 1. The ISC Status field, IR[3], \ncontains logic 1 if the device is currently in In-System \nConfiguration (ISC) mode; otherwise, it contains logic 0. The DONE field, IR[2], contains logic 1 if the sampled design \nrevision has been successfully programmed; otherwise, a logic \n0 indicates incomplete programming.

Each output pin on the Platform Flash PROM has two register stages which contribute to the Boundary-Scan register, while each input pin has only one register stage. The bidirectional pins have a total of three register stages which contribute to the Boundary-Scan register. For each output pin, the register stage nearest to TDI controls and observes the output state, and the second stage closest to TDO controls and observes the High-Z enable state of the output pin. For each input pin, a single register stage controls and observes the input state of the pin. The bidirectional pin combines the three bits, the input stage bit is first, followed by the output stage bit and finally the output enable stage bit. The output enable stage bit is closest to TDO.\nSee Table 12, page 24  and Table 13, page 26  for the \nBoundary-Scan bit order for all connected device pins, or see \nthe appropriate BSDL file for the complete Boundary-Scan bit \norder description under the “attribute BOUNDARY_REGISTER” section in the BSDL file. The bit \nassigned to Boundary-Scan cell 0 is the LSB in the Boundary-\nScan register, and is the register bit closest to TDO.\nIdentification Registers\nIDCODE Register\nThe IDCODE is a fixed, vendor-assigned value that is used to \nelectrically identify the manuf acturer and type of the device \nbeing addressed. The IDCODE re gister is 32 bits wide. The \nIDCODE register can be shifted out for examination by using the IDCODE instruction. The IDCODE is available to any other system component via JTAG. Table 8  lists the IDCODE \nregister values for the Platform Flash PROMs.\nThe IDCODE register has the following binary format:\nvvvv:ffff:ffff:aaaa:aaaa:cccc:cccc:ccc1\nwhere\nv = the die version number\nf = the PROM family code\na = the specific Platform Flash PROM product ID\nc = the Xilinx manufacturer\'s IDThe LSB of the IDCODE register is always read as logic 1 \nas defined by IEEE Std. 1149.1.\nUSERCODE Register\nThe USERCODE instruction gives access to a 32-bit user programmable scratch pad typically used to supply information about the device\'s programmed contents. By using the USERCODE instruction, a user-programmable identification code can be shifted out for examination. This \ncode is loaded into the USERCODE register during \nprogramming of the Platform Flash PROM. If the device is blank or was not loaded during programming, the USERCODE register contains FFFFFFFFh .\nCustomer Code Register\nFor the XCFxxP Platform Flash PROM, in addition to the \nUSERCODE, a unique 32-byte Customer Code can be \nassigned to each design revision enabled for the PROM. The Customer Code is set during programming, and is \ntypically used to supply information about the design \nrevision contents. A private JTAG instruction is required to read the Customer Code. If the PROM is blank, or the \nCustomer Code for the selected design revision was not \nloaded during programming, or if the particular design revision is erased, the Customer Code contains all ones.Table  6: XCFxxS Instruction Capture Values Loaded into IR as part of an Instruction Scan Sequence\nTDI → IR[7:5] IR[4] IR[3] IR[2] IR[1:0]\n→  TDO\nReserved ISC Status Security 0 0 1\nTable  7: XCFxxP Instruction Capture Values Loaded into IR as part of an Instruction Scan Sequence\nTDI → IR[15:9] IR[8:7] IR[6:5] IR[4] IR[3] IR[2] IR[1:0]\n→  TDO\nReserved ISC ErrorER/PROG \nErrorER/PROG \nStatusISC Status DONE 0 1\nTable  8: IDCODES Assigned to Platform Flash PROMs\nDevice IDCODE(1) (hex)\nXCF01S <v>5044093\nXCF02S <v>5045093\nXCF04S <v>5046093\nXCF08P <v>5057093\nXCF16P <v>5058093\nXCF32P <v>5059093\nNotes: \n1.

This simplifies system designs and allows standard Automatic Test Equipment to perform both functions. The AC characteristics of the Platform Flash PROM TAP are described as follows.TAP Timing\nFigure 4  shows the timing relationships of the TAP signals. \nThese TAP timing characterist ics are identical for both \nBoundary-Scan and ISP operations.\nTAP AC Parameters\nTable 9  shows the timing parameters for the TAP waveforms shown in Figure 4 .X-Ref Target - Figure 4\nFigure 4: Test Access Port Timing\nTable  9: Test Access Port Timing Parameters\nSymbol Description Min Max Units\nTCKMIN TCK minimum clock period when VCCJ = 2.5V or 3.3V 67 – ns\nTMSS TMS setup time when VCCJ = 2.5V or 3.3V 8 – ns\nTMSH TMS hold time when VCCJ = 2.5V or 3.3V 25 – ns\nTDIS TDI setup time when VCCJ = 2.5V or 3.3V 8 – ns\nTDIH TDI hold time when VCCJ = 2.5V or 3.3V 25 – ns\nTDOV TDO valid delay when VCCJ = 2.5V or 3.3V – 22 nsTCKTCKMIN\nTMSS\nTM S\nTDI\nTDOTMSH\nTDIH\nTDOVTDIS\nDS123_04_0 31808\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 8R\nAdditional Features for the XCFxxP\nInternal Oscillator\nThe 8/16/32 Mb XCFxxP Platform Flash PROMs include an \noptional internal oscillator wh ich can be used to drive the \nCLKOUT and DATA pins on FPGA configuration interface. The internal oscillator can be enabled when programming \nthe PROM, and the oscillator can be set to either the default \nfrequency or to a slower frequency. Refer to the “XCFxxP Decompression and Clock Options” chapter of UG161\n, \nPlatform Flash PROM User Guide , for internal oscillator \nrecommendations.\nCLKOUT\nThe 8/16/32 Mb XCFxxP Platform Flash PROMs include the programmable option to enable the CLKOUT signal which allows the PROM to provide a source synchronous clock aligned to the data on the configuration interface. The CLKOUT signal is derived from one of two clock sources: the CLK input pin or the internal oscillator. The input clock source is selected during the PROM programming sequence. Output data is available on the rising edge of CLKOUT.\nThe CLKOUT signal is enabled during programming, and is \nactive when CE\n is Low and OE/RESET  is High. On CE  \nrising edge transition, if OE/RESET  is High and the PROM \nterminal count has not been reached, then CLKOUT remains active for an additional eights clock cycles before being disabled. On a OE/RESET\n falling edge transition, \nCLKOUT is immediately disabled. When disabled, the CLKOUT pin is put into a high-impedance state and should be pulled High externally to provide a known state.\nWhen cascading Platform Flash PROMs with CLKOUT \nenabled, after completing it\'s data transfer, the first PROM disables CLKOUT and drives the CEO\n pin enabling the next \nPROM in the PROM chain. The next PROM begins driving \nthe CLKOUT signal once that PROM is enabled and data is available for transfer.\nDuring high-speed parallel configuration without \ncompression, the FPGA drives the BUSY signal on the configuration interface. When BUSY is asserted High, the PROMs internal address counter stops incrementing, and the current data value is held on the data outputs. While BUSY is High, the PROM cont inues driving the CLKOUT \nsignal to the FPGA, clocking the FPGA’s configuration logic. When the FPGA deasserts BUSY, indicating that it is ready to receive additional configuration data, the PROM begins driving new data onto the configuration interface.\nDecompression\nThe 8/16/32 Mb XCFxxP Platform Flash PROMs include a built-in data decompressor comp atible with Xilinx advanced \ncompression technology. Compressed Platform Flash PROM files are created from the target FPGA bitstream(s) using the iMPACT software. Only Slave Serial and Slave SelectMAP (parallel) configuration modes are supported for \nFPGA configuration when using a XCFxxP PROM programmed with a compressed bitstream. Compression rates vary depending on several factors, including the target \ndevice family and the target design contents.\nThe decompression option is enabled during the PROM \nprogramming sequence. The PROM decompresses the stored data before driving both clock and data onto the FPGA\'s configuration interface. If Decompression is enabled, then the Platform Flash clock output pin (CLKOUT) must be used as the clock signal for the configuration interface, driving the target FPGA\'s configuration clock input pin (CCLK). Either the PROM\'s CLK input pin or the internal oscillator must be selected as \nthe source for CLKOUT. Any target FPGA connected to the PROM must operate as slave in the configuration chain, with the configuration mode set to Slave Serial mode or Slave SelectMap (parallel) mode.\nWhen decompression is enabled, the CLKOUT signal \nbecomes a controlled clock output with a reduced maximum frequency. When decompressed data is not ready, the CLKOUT pin is put into a high-Z state and must be pulled High externally to provide a known state.\nThe BUSY input is automatically disabled when \ndecompression is enabled.\nSee the "Decompression Setups" section in the Platform \nFlash PROM User Guide  for setup details.\nDesign Revisioning\nDesign Revisioning allows the user to create up to four \nunique design revisions on a si ngle PROM or stored across \nmultiple cascaded PROMs. Design Revisioning is supported \nfor the 8/16/32 Mb XCFxxP Platform Flash PROMs in both \nserial and parallel modes. Design Revisioning can be used with compressed PROM files, and also when the CLKOUT feature is enabled. The PROM programming files along with the revision information files ( .cfi ) are created using the \niMPACT software. The .cfi  file is required to enable design \nrevision programming in iMPACT.\nA single design revision is composed of from 1 to n 8M b  \nmemory blocks. If a single de sign revision contains less \nthan 8 Mb of data, then the remaining space is padded with all ones. A larger design revision can span several 8 Mb memory blocks, and any space remaining in the last 8 Mb memory block is padded with all ones.\n\x81 A single 32 Mb PROM contains four 8 Mb memory \nblocks, and can therefore store up to four separate design revisions: one 32 Mb design revision, two 16 Mb design revisions, three 8 Mb design revisions, four 8 Mb design revisions, and so on.\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 9R\n\x81 Because of the 8 Mb minimum size requirement for \neach revision, a single 16 Mb PROM can only store up to two separate design revisions: one 16 Mb design revision, one 8 Mb design revision, or two 8 Mb design revisions.\n\x81 A single 8 Mb PROM can store only one 8 Mb design \nrevision.\nLarger design revisions can be split over several cascaded \nPROMs. For example, two 32 Mb PROMs can store up to four \nseparate design revisions: one 64 Mb design revision, two \n32 Mb design revisions, three 16 Mb design revisions, four 16 Mb design revisions, and so on. When cascading one \n16 Mb PROM and one 8 Mb PROM, there are 24 Mb of \navailable space, and therefore up to three separate design revisions can be stored: one 24 Mb design revision, two 8 Mb \ndesign revisions, or three 8 Mb design revisions.\nSee Figure 5  for a few basic examples of how multiple \nrevisions can be stored. The design revision partitioning is \nhandled automatically during file generation in iMPACT.\nDuring the PROM file creation, each design revision is \nassigned a revision number:\nRevision 0 = \' 00\' \nRevision 1 = \' 01\'\nRevision 2 = \' 10\'\nRevision 3 = \' 11\'\nAfter programming the Platform Flash PROM with a set of \ndesign revisions, a particular design revision can be selected using the external REV_SEL[1:0] pins or using the internal programmable design revision control bits. The EN_EXT_SEL\n pin determines if the external pins or internal \nbits are used to select the design revision. When EN_EXT_SEL\n is Low, design revision selection is controlled \nby the external Revision Select pins, REV_SEL[1:0]. When EN_EXT_SEL\n is High, design revision selection is \ncontrolled by the internal programmable Revision Select control bits. During power up, the design revision selection inputs (pins or control bits) are sampled internally. After power up, the design revision selection inputs are sampled again when any of the following events occur:\n\x81 On the rising edge of CE.\n\x81 On the falling edge of OE/RESET  (when CE  is Low).\n\x81 On the rising edge of CF  (when CE  is Low).\n\x81 When reconfiguration is initiated by using the JTAG \nCONFIG instruction.\nThe data from the selected design revision is then \npresented on the FPGA configuration interface.\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 10R\nInitiating FPGA Configuration\nThe options for initiating FPGA configuration via the \nPlatform Flash PROM include:\n\x81 Automatic configuration on power up\n\x81 Applying an external pulse to the FPGA PROGRAM_B \npin\n\x81 Applying the JTAG CONFIG  instruction to the PROM\nFollowing the FPGA’s power-on sequence or the assertion \nof the PROGRAM_B pin, the FPGA’s configuration memory is cleared, the configuration mode is selected, and the FPGA is ready to accept a new configuration bitstream. The FPGA’s PROGRAM_B pin can be controlled by an external \nsource, or alternatively, the Platform Flash PROMs incorporate a CF\n pin that can be tied to the FPGA’s \nPROGRAM_B pin. Executing the CONFIG instruction through JTAG pulses the CF\n output Low once for \n300-500 ns, resetting the FPGA and initiating configuration. The iMPACT software can issue the JTAG CONFIG command to initiate FPGA configuration by setting the “Load FPGA” option.When using the XCFxxP Platform Flash PROM with design \nrevisioning enabled, the CF\n pin should always be connected \nto the PROGRAM_B pin on the FPGA to ensure that the current design revision sele ction is sampled when the \nFPGA is reset. The XCFxxP PROM samples the current design revision selection from the external REV_SEL pins or the internal programmable Revision Select bits on the rising edge of CF\n. When the JTAG CONFIG command is \nexecuted, the XCFxxP samples the new design revision selection before initiating the FPGA configuration \nsequence. When using the XCFxxP Platform Flash PROM without design revisi oning, if the CF\n pin is not connected to \nthe FPGA PROGRAM_B pin, then the XCFxxP CF  pin must \nbe tied High.X-Ref Target - Figure 5\nFigure 5: Design Revision Storage ExamplesREV 0\n(8 Mbits)\nREV 1\n(8 Mbits)\nREV 2\n(8 Mbits)\nREV 3\n(8 Mbits)REV 0\n(8 Mbits)\nREV 1\n(8 Mbits)\nREV 2\n(16 Mbits)REV 0\n(16 Mbits)\nREV 1\n(16 Mbits)REV 0\n(8 Mbits)\nREV 1\n(24 Mbits)REV 0\n(32 Mbits)\n4 Design Revisions 3 Design Revisions 2 Design Revisions 1 Design Revision\n(a)  Design Revision storage examples for a single XCF32P PROM\nREV 0\n(16 Mbits)\nREV 1\n(16 Mbits)\nREV 2\n(16 Mbits)\nREV 3\n(16 Mbits)REV 0\n(16 Mbits)\nREV 1\n(16 Mbits)\nREV 2\n(32 Mbits)REV 0\n(32 Mbits)\nREV 1\n(32 Mbits)REV 0\n(16 Mbits)\nREV 1\n(16 Mbits)REV 0\n(32 Mbits)\n4 Design Revisions 3 Design Revisions 2 Design Revisions 1 Design Revision\n(b)  Design Revision storage examples spanning two XCF32P PROMsPROM 0 PROM 0 PROM 0 PROM 0 PROM 0\nPROM 0 PROM 0 PROM 0 PROM 0 PROM 0\nREV 0\n(32 Mbits)REV 1\n(32 Mbits)PROM 1 PROM 1 PROM 1 PROM 1 PROM 1\nds123_20_102103\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 11R\nReset and Power-On Reset Activation\nAt power up, the device requires the VCCINT  power supply to \nmonotonically rise to the nominal operating voltage within the specified V\nCCINT  rise time. If the power supply cannot \nmeet this requirement, then the device might not perform power-on reset properly. During the power-up sequence, OE/RESET\n is held Low by the PROM. Once the required \nsupplies have reached their respective POR (Power On Reset) thresholds, the OE/RESET\n release is delayed (TOER \nminimum) to allow more margin for the power supplies to stabilize before initiating configuration. The OE/RESET\n pin \nis connected to an external 4.7 k Ω pull-up resistor and also \nto the target FPGA\'s INIT pi n. For systems utilizing slow-\nrising power supplies, an additional power monitoring circuit can be used to delay the target configuration until the system power reaches minimum operating voltages by holding the OE/RESET\n pin Low. When OE/RESET  is \nreleased, the FPGA’s INIT pin is pulled High allowing the FPGA\'s configuration sequence to begin. If the power drops below the power-down threshold (V\nCCPD ), the PROM resets \nand OE/RESET  is again held Low until the after the POR \nthreshold is reached. OE/RESET  polarity is not \nprogrammable. These power-up requirements are shown graphically in Figure 6 .\nFor a fully powered Platform Flash PROM, a reset occurs \nwhenever OE/RESET\n is asserted (Low) or CE  is deasserted \n(High). The address counter is reset, CEO  is driven High, and \nthe remaining outputs are placed in a high-impedance state.\nNote:\n1. The XCFxxS PROM only requires VCCINT  to rise above \nits POR threshold before releasing OE/RESET .\n2. The XCFxxP PROM requires both VCCINT  to rise above its \nPOR threshold and for VCCO to reach the recommended \noperating voltage level before releasing OE/RESET .\nI/O Input Voltage Tolerance and Power Sequencing\nThe I/Os on each re-programmable Platform Flash PROM are fully 3.3V-tolerant. This allows 3V CMOS signals to \nconnect directly to the inputs without damage. The core power supply (V\nCCINT ), JTAG pin power supply (VCCJ), \noutput power supply (VCCO), and external 3V CMOS I/O \nsignals can be applied in any order.\nAdditionally, for the XCFxxS PROM only, when VCCO is \nsupplied at 2.5V or 3.3V and VCCINT  is supplied at 3.3V, the \nI/Os are 5V-tolerant. This allows 5V CMOS signals to connect directly to the inputs on a powered XCFxxS PROM without damage. Failure to power the PROM correctly while supplying a 5V input signal ca n result in damage to the \nXCFxxS device.X-Ref Target - Figure 6\nFigure 6: Platform Flash PROM Power-Up RequirementsTOERVCCINT\nVCCPOR\nVCCPD200 µ s ramp50 m s ramp\nTOER TRSTTIME (m s)A slow-r amping V CCINT  supply m ay still \nbe below the minim um oper ating \nvolt age when OE/RE SET i s rele ased. \nIn thi s case, the config uration \nsequence m ust be del ayed until both \nVCCINT  and V CCO have re ached their \nrecommended oper ating condition s.Recommended Operatin g Range\nDelay or Re start\nConfi guration\nds123_21_10 3103\nPlatform Flash In-System Prog rammable Configuration PROMs\nDS123 (v2.19) June 6, 2016 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 12R\nStandby Mode\nThe PROM enters a low-power standby mode whenever CE  is \ndeasserted (High). In standby mode, the address counter is reset, CEO\n is driven High, and the remaining outputs are \nplaced in a high-impedance state regardless of the state of the OE/RESET\n input. For the device to remain in the low-power \nstandby mode, the JTAG pins TMS, TDI, and TDO must not be pulled Low, and TCK must be stopped (High or Low).\nWhen using the FPGA DONE signal to drive the PROM CE\n \npin High to reduce standby power after configuration, an external pull-up resistor should be used. Typically a 330 Ω pull-up resistor is used, but refer to the appropriate FPGA \ndata sheet for the recommended DONE pin pull-up value. If the DONE circuit is connected to an LED to indicate FPGA configuration is complete, and is also connected to the PROM CE\n pin to enable low-power standby mode, then an \nexternal buffer should be used to drive the LED circuit to ensure valid transitions on the PROM’s CE\n pin. If low-power \nstandby mode is not required for the PROM, then the CE  pin \nshould be connected to ground.\n Table  10: Truth Table for XCFxxS PROM Control Inputs\nControl Inputs\nInternal AddressOutputs\nOE/RESET CE DATA CEO ICC\nHigh LowIf address < TC(2) : increment Active High Active\nIf address = TC(2) : don\'t change High-Z Low Reduced\nLow Low Held reset High-Z High Active\nX(1) High Held reset High-Z High Standby\nNotes: \n1.
