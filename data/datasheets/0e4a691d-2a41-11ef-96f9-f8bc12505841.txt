different \nmanufacturers optimized for use with the LM2594xx series. This feature greatly simplifies the design of switch-\nmode power supplies.\nOther features include an ensured ±4% tolerance on output voltage under all conditions of input voltage and \noutput load conditions, and ±15% on the oscillator frequency. External shutdown is included, featuring typically \n85-μA standby current. Self-protection features include a two stage frequency reducing current limit for the \noutput switch and an overtemperature shutdown for complete protection under fault conditions.\nThe LM2594HV is for applications requiring an input voltage up to 60 V.\n6 Pin Configuration and Functions\nNot to scale1 NC 8 Output\n2 NC 7 +VIN\n3 NC 6 Ground\n4 Feedback 5 ON/OFF\n*No internal connection, but must be soldered to PCB for best heat transfer.\n‡Patent Number 5,382,918.\nFigure 6-1.

Pulling this pin below a threshold \nvoltage of approximately 1.3 V turns the regulator on, and pulling this pin above 1.3 V (up \nto a maximum of 25 V) shuts the regulator down. If this shutdown feature is not needed, \nthe ON/OFF pin can be wired to the ground pin or it can be left open, in either case, the \nregulator is in the ON condition.\n6 Ground — Circuit ground\n7 +VIN IThis is the positive input supply for the IC switching regulator.

The regulator is capable \nof delivering up to 0.5-A DC load current with excellent line and load regulation. These devices are available \nin fixed output voltages of 3.3-V, 5-V, 12-V, and an adjustable output version. The family requires few external \ncomponents, and the pin arrangement was designed for simple, optimum PCB layout.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Delayed Start-Up\nThe circuit in Figure 8-1  uses the ON/OFF pin to provide a time delay between the time the input voltage is \napplied and the time the output voltage comes up (only the circuitry pertaining to the delayed start-up is shown). \nAs the input voltage rises, the charging of capacitor C1 pulls the ON/OFF pin high, keeping the regulator off. \nAfter the input voltage reaches its final value and the capacitor stops charging, the resistor R 2 pulls the ON/OFF \npin low, thus allowing the circuit to start switching. Resistor R 1 is included to limit the maximum voltage applied \nto the ON/OFF pin (maximum of 25 V), reduces power supply noise sensitivity, and also limits the capacitor, \nC1, discharge current. When high input ripple voltage exists, avoid long delay time, because this ripple can be \ncoupled into the ON/OFF pin and cause problems.\nThis delayed start-up feature is useful in situations where the input power source is limited in the amount of \ncurrent it can deliver. It allows the input voltage to rise to a higher voltage before the regulator starts operating. \nBuck regulators require less input current at higher input voltages.\nFigure 8-1. Delayed Start-Up\nwww.ti.comLM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\n8.3.2 Undervoltage Lockout\nSome applications require the regulator to remain off until the input voltage reaches a predetermined voltage. \nFigure 8-2  shows an undervoltage lockout feature applied to a buck regulator, while Figure 8-3  and Figure 8-4 \napply the same feature to an inverting circuit. The circuit in Figure 8-3  features a constant threshold voltage for \nturnon and turnoff (Zener voltage plus approximately 1 V). If hysteresis is needed, the circuit in Figure 8-4  has a \nturnon voltage which is different than the turnoff voltage. The amount of hysteresis is approximately equal to the \nvalue of the output voltage. If Zener voltages greater than 25 V are used, an additional 47-k Ω resistor is needed \nfrom the ON/OFF pin to the ground pin to stay within the 25 V maximum limit of the ON/OFF pin.\nFigure 8-2. Undervoltage Lockout for Buck Regulator\n8.3.3 Inverting Regulator\nThe circuit in Figure 8-5  converts a positive input voltage to a negative output voltage with a common ground. \nThe circuit operates by bootstrapping the regulators ground pin to the negative output voltage, then grounding \nthe feedback pin, the regulator senses the inverted output voltage and regulates it.\nThis circuit has an ON/OFF threshold of approximately 13 V.\nFigure 8-3. Undervoltage Lockout for Inverting Regulator\nThis circuit has hysteresis Regulator starts switching at V IN = 13 V Regulator stops switching at V IN = 8 V\nFigure 8-4.

Inverting −5-V Regulator With Delayed Start-Up\nThis example uses the LM2594-5 to generate a −5-V output, but other output voltages are possible by selecting \nother output voltage versions, including the adjustable version. Because this regulator topology can produce \nan output voltage that is either greater than or less than the input voltage, the maximum output current greatly \ndepends on both the input and output voltage. Figure 8-6  provides a guide as to the amount of output load \ncurrent possible for the different input and output voltage conditions.\nThe maximum voltage appearing across the regulator is the absolute sum of the input and output voltage, and \nthis must be limited to a maximum of 40 V. For example, when converting 20 V to −12 V, the regulator can see \n32 V between the input pin and ground pin. The LM2594 has a maximum input voltage specification of 40 V (60 \nV for the LM2594HV).\nAdditional diodes are required in this regulator configuration. Diode D1 is used to isolate input voltage ripple or \nnoise from coupling through the C IN capacitor to the output, under light or no load conditions. Also, this diode \nisolation changes the topology to closely resemble a buck configuration thus providing good closed loop stability. \nTI recommends a Schottky diode for low input voltages (because of its lower voltage drop), but for higher input \nvoltages, a fast recovery diode can be used.\nWithout diode D3, when the input voltage is first applied, the charging current of C IN can pull the output positive \nby several volts for a short period of time. Adding D3 prevents the output from going positive by more than a \ndiode voltage.\nFigure 8-6. Inverting Regulator Typical Load Current\nBecause of differences in the operation of the inverting regulator, the standard design procedure is not used \nto select the inductor value. In the majority of designs, a 100- μH, 1-A inductor is the best choice. Capacitor \nselection can also be narrowed down to just a few values. Using the values shown in Figure 8-5  provides good \nresults in the majority of inverting designs.\nThis type of inverting regulator can require relatively large amounts of input current when starting up, even \nwith light loads. Input currents as high as the LM2594 current limit (approximately 0.8 A) are needed for at \nleast 2 ms or more, until the output reaches its nominal output voltage. The actual time depends on the output \nvoltage and the size of the output capacitor. Input power sources that are current limited or sources that can not \ndeliver these currents without getting loaded down, can not work correctly. Because of the relatively high start-up \ncurrents required by the inverting topology, the delayed start-up feature (C1, R 1 and R 2) shown in Figure 8-5  is \nrecommended. By delaying the regulator start-up, the input capacitor is allowed to charge up to a higher voltage \nwww.ti.comLM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\nbefore the switcher begins operating. A portion of the high input current needed for start-up is now supplied \nby the input capacitor (C IN). For severe start-up conditions, the input capacitor can be made much larger than \nnormal.\n8.3.4 Inverting Regulator Shutdown Methods\nTo use the ON/OFF pin in a standard buck configuration is simple; pull it below 1.3 V (at 25°C, referenced to \nground) to turn regulator ON and pull it above 1.3 V to shut the regulator OFF. With the inverting configuration, \nsome level shifting is required, because the ground pin of the regulator is no longer at ground, but is now setting \nat the negative output voltage level. Two different shutdown methods for inverting regulators are shown in Figure \n8-7 and Figure 8-8 .\nFigure 8-7. Inverting Regulator Ground Referenced Shutdown\nFigure 8-8. Inverting Regulator Ground Referenced Shutdown Using Opto Device\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Discontinuous Mode Operation\nThe selection guide chooses inductor values suitable for continuous mode operation, but for low current \napplications and high input voltages, a discontinuous mode design can be a better choice. Discontinuous mode \ncan use an inductor that is physically smaller, and can need only one half to one third of the inductance value \nneeded for a continuous mode design. The peak switch and inductor currents are higher in a discontinuous \ndesign, but at these low load currents (200 mA and below), the maximum switch current is still less than the \nswitch current limit.\nDiscontinuous operation can have voltage waveforms that are considerably different than a continuous design. \nThe output pin (switch) waveform can have some damped sinusoidal ringing present (see Figure 9-11 ). This \nringing is normal for discontinuous operation, and is not caused by feedback loop instabilities. In discontinuous \noperation, there is a period of time where neither the switch nor the diode are conducting, and the inductor \ncurrent has dropped to zero. During this time, a small amount of energy can circulate between the inductor \nand the switch or diode parasitic capacitance causing this characteristic ringing. Normally this ringing is not a \nproblem, unless the amplitude becomes great enough to exceed the input voltage, and even then, there is very \nlittle energy present to cause damage.\nDifferent inductor types and core materials produce different amounts of this characteristic ringing. Ferrite core \ninductors have very little core loss and, therefore, produce the most ringing. The higher core loss of powdered LM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\niron inductors produce less ringing. If desired, a series RC can be placed in parallel with the inductor to dampen \nthe ringing.\nFigure 8-9.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\n9.1.1 Input Capacitor (C IN)\nA low ESR aluminum or tantalum bypass capacitor is required between the input pin and ground pin. The \ncapacitor must be located near the regulator using short leads. This capacitor prevents large voltage transients \nfrom appearing at the input, and provides the instantaneous current needed each time the switch turns on.\nThe important parameters for the input capacitor are the voltage rating and the RMS current rating. Because \nof the relatively high RMS currents flowing in the input capacitor of the buck regulator, this capacitor must be \nchosen for its RMS current rating rather than its capacitance or voltage ratings, although the capacitance value \nand voltage rating are directly related to the RMS current rating.\nThe RMS current rating of a capacitor can be viewed as a power rating of the capacitor. The RMS current \nflowing through the capacitors internal ESR produces power which causes the internal temperature of the \ncapacitor to rise. The RMS current rating of a capacitor is determined by the amount of current required to \nraise the internal temperature approximately 10°C above an ambient temperature of 105°C. The ability of the \ncapacitor to dissipate this heat to the surrounding air determines the amount of current the capacitor can safely \nsustain. Capacitors that are physically large and have a large surface area typically has a higher RMS current \nratings. For a given capacitor value, a higher voltage electrolytic capacitor is physically larger than a lower \nvoltage capacitor, and thus be able to dissipate more heat to the surrounding air, and therefore has a higher \nRMS current rating.\nThe consequences of operating an electrolytic capacitor above the RMS current rating is a shortened operating \nlife. The higher temperature speeds up the evaporation of the electrolyte of the capacitor, resulting in eventual \nfailure.\nSelecting an input capacitor requires consulting the manufacturers data sheet for maximum allowable RMS \nripple current. For a maximum ambient temperature of 40°C, a general guideline can be to select a capacitor \nwith a ripple current rating of approximately 50% of the DC load current. For ambient temperatures up to 70°C, \na current rating of 75% of the DC load current can be a good choice for a conservative design. The capacitor \nvoltage rating must be at least 1.25 times greater than the maximum input voltage, and often a much higher \nvoltage capacitor is needed to satisfy the RMS current requirements.\nFigure 9-1  shows the relationship between an electrolytic capacitor value, its voltage rating, and the RMS current \nit is rated for. These curves were obtained from the Nichicon PL series of low-ESR, high-reliability electrolytic \ncapacitors designed for switching regulator applications. Other capacitor manufacturers offer similar types of \ncapacitors, but always check the capacitor data sheet.\nStandard  electrolytic capacitors typically have much higher ESR numbers, lower RMS current ratings and \ntypically have a shorter operating lifetime.\nBecause of their small size and excellent performance, surface-mount solid tantalum capacitors are often used \nfor input bypassing, but several precautions must be observed. A small percentage of solid tantalum capacitors \ncan short if the inrush current rating is exceeded. This can happen at turnon when the input voltage is suddenly \napplied, and of course, higher input voltages produce higher inrush currents. Several capacitor manufacturers \ndo a 100% surge current testing on their products to minimize this potential problem. If high turnon currents are \nexpected, it can be necessary to limit this current by adding either some resistance or inductance before the \ntantalum capacitor, or select a higher voltage capacitor. As with aluminum electrolytic capacitors, the RMS ripple \ncurrent rating must be sized to the load current.LM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\nFigure 9-1. RMS Current Ratings for Low-ESR Electrolytic Capacitors (Typical)\n9.1.2 Output Capacitor (C OUT)\nAn output capacitor is required to filter the output and provide regulator loop stability. Low impedance or low \nESR Electrolytic or solid tantalum capacitors designed for switching regulator applications must be used. When \nselecting an output capacitor, the important capacitor parameters are; the 100-kHz Equivalent Series Resistance \n(ESR), the RMS ripple current rating, voltage rating, and capacitance value. For the output capacitor, the ESR \nvalue is the most important parameter.\nThe output capacitor requires an ESR value that has an upper and lower limit. For low output ripple voltage, a \nlow ESR value is needed. This value is determined by the maximum allowable output ripple voltage, typically 1% \nto 2% of the output voltage. But if the ESR of the selected capacitor is extremely low, there is a possibility of \nan unstable feedback loop, resulting in an oscillation at the output. Using the capacitors listed in the tables, or \nsimilar types, provides design solutions under all conditions.\nIf very low output ripple voltage (less than 15 mV) is required, see Section 9.1.5  for a post-ripple filter.\nAn aluminum electrolytic capacitor ESR value is related to the capacitance value and its voltage rating. In most \ncases, Higher voltage electrolytic capacitors have lower ESR values (see Figure 9-2 ). Often, capacitors with \nmuch higher voltage ratings can be needed to provide the low ESR values required for low output ripple voltage.\nThe output capacitor for many different switcher designs often can be satisfied with only three or four different \ncapacitor values and several different voltage ratings. See Figure 9-8  and Table 9-7  for typical capacitor values, \nvoltage ratings, and manufacturers capacitor types.\nElectrolytic capacitors are not recommended for temperatures below −25°C. The ESR rises dramatically at cold \ntemperatures and typically rises three times at −25°C and as much as ten times at −40°C (see Figure 9-3 ).\nSolid tantalum capacitors have a much better ESR specifications for cold temperatures and are recommended \nfor temperatures below −25°C.\nFigure 9-2.

This \nmust be a fast diode and must be located close to the LM2594 using short leads and short printed-circuit traces.\nBecause of their very fast switching speed and low forward voltage drop, Schottky diodes provide the best \nperformance, especially in low output voltage applications (5 V and lower). Ultra-fast recovery, or high-efficiency \nrectifiers are also a good choice, but some types with an abrupt turnoff characteristic can cause instability or EMI \nproblems. Ultra-fast recovery diodes typically have reverse recovery times of 50 ns or less. Rectifiers such as \nthe 1N4001 series are much too slow and must not be used.\nFigure 9-3.

The difference \nbetween the two types relates to the inductor current, whether it is flowing continuously, or if it drops to \nzero for a period of time in the normal switching cycle. Each mode has distinctively different operating \ncharacteristics, which can affect the regulators performance and requirements. Most switcher designs operates \nin the discontinuous mode when the load current is low.\nThe LM2594 (or any of the SIMPLE SWITCHER power converter family) can be used for both continuous or \ndiscontinuous modes of operation.\nIn many cases the preferred mode of operation is the continuous mode. This mode offers greater output \npower, lower peak switch, inductor, and diode currents, and can have lower output ripple voltage. However, the \ncontinuous mode requires larger inductor values to keep the inductor current flowing continuously, especially at \nlow output load currents and high input voltages.\nTo simplify the inductor selection process, an inductor selection guide (nomograph) was designed (see Figure \n9-5 through Figure 9-8 ). This guide assumes that the regulator is operating in the continuous mode, and selects \nan inductor that allows a peak-to-peak inductor ripple current to be a certain percentage of the maximum design \nload current. This peak-to-peak inductor ripple current percentage is not fixed, but is allowed to change as \ndifferent design load currents are selected. (See Figure 9-4 ).\nFigure 9-4. (ΔIIND) Peak-to-Peak Inductor Ripple Current (as a Percentage of the Load Current) versus \nLoad Current\nBy allowing the percentage of inductor ripple current to increase for low load currents, the inductor value and \nsize can be kept relatively low.\nWhen operating in the continuous mode, the inductor current waveform ranges from a triangular to a sawtooth \ntype of waveform (depending on the input voltage), with the average value of this current waveform equal to the \nDC output load current.\nInductors are available in different styles such as pot core, toroid, E-core, bobbin core, and so forth, as \nwell as different core materials, such as ferrites and powdered iron. The least expensive, the bobbin, rod or \nstick core, consists of wire wrapped on a ferrite bobbin. This type of construction makes for a inexpensive \ninductor; however, because the magnetic flux is not completely contained within the core, it generates more \nElectro-Magnetic Interference (EMl). This magnetic flux can induce voltages into nearby printed-circuit traces, \nwww.ti.comLM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\nthus causing problems with both the switching regulator operation and nearby sensitive circuitry, and can give \nincorrect scope readings because of induced voltages in the scope probe (see Section 9.1.6 ).\nThe inductors listed in the selection chart include ferrite E-core construction for Schott ferrite bobbin core for \nRenco and Coilcraft, and powdered iron toroid for Pulse Engineering.\nExceeding the maximum current rating of the inductor can cause the inductor to overheat because of the copper \nwire losses, or the core can saturate. If the inductor begins to saturate, the inductance decreases rapidly and the \ninductor begins to look mainly resistive (the DC resistance of the winding). This can cause the switch current to \nrise very rapidly and force the switch into a cycle-by-cycle current limit, thus reducing the DC output load current. \nThis can also result in overheating of the inductor and the LM2594. Different inductor types have different \nsaturation characteristics, and this must be kept in mind when selecting an inductor.\nThe inductor manufacturers data sheets include current and energy limits to avoid inductor saturation.\nFor continuous mode operation, see the inductor selection graphs in Figure 9-5  through Figure 9-8 .\nFigure 9-5.

A typical output ripple voltage can range from approximately 0.5% to 3% of the output voltage. To \nobtain low ripple voltage, the ESR of the output capacitor must be low; however, caution must be exercised \nwhen using extremely low ESR capacitors because they can affect the loop stability, resulting in oscillation \nproblems. If very low output ripple voltage is needed (less than 15 mV), TI recommends a post ripple filter (see \nFigure 9-13 ). The inductance required is typically between 1 μH and 5 μH, with low DC resistance, to maintain \ngood load regulation. A low ESR output filter capacitor is also required to assure good dynamic load response \nand ripple reduction. The ESR of this capacitor can be as low as desired, because it is out of the regulator \nfeedback loop. Figure 8-9  shows a typical output ripple voltage, with and without a post ripple filter.\nWhen observing output ripple with a scope, it is essential that a short, low inductance scope probe ground \nconnection be used. Most scope probe manufacturers provide a special probe terminator which is soldered onto \nthe regulator board, preferably at the output capacitor. This provides a very short scope ground, thus eliminating \nthe problems associated with the three-inch ground lead normally provided with the probe, and provides a much \ncleaner and more accurate picture of the ripple voltage waveform.\nThe voltage spikes are caused by the fast switching action of the output switch and the diode, the parasitic \ninductance of the output filter capacitor, and its associated wiring. To minimize these voltage spikes, the output \ncapacitor must be designed for switching regulator applications, and the lead lengths must be kept very short. \nWiring inductance, stray capacitance, as well as the scope probe used to evaluate these transients, all contribute \nto the amplitude of these spikes.\nWhen a switching regulator is operating in the continuous mode, the inductor current waveform ranges from a \ntriangular to a sawtooth type of waveform (depending on the input voltage). For a given input and output voltage, \nthe peak-to-peak amplitude of this inductor current waveform remains constant. As the load current increases or \ndecreases, the entire sawtooth current waveform also rises and falls. The average value (or the center) of this \ncurrent waveform is equal to the DC load current.\nwww.ti.comLM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\nIf the load current drops to a low enough level, the bottom of the sawtooth current waveform reaches zero, and \nthe switcher smoothly changes from a continuous to a discontinuous mode of operation. Most switcher designs \n(regardless how large the inductor value is) is forced to run discontinuous if the output is lightly loaded. This is a \nperfectly acceptable mode of operation.\nFigure 9-9. Peak-to-Peak Inductor Ripple Current vs Load Current\nIn a switching regulator design, knowing the value of the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current ( ΔIIND) can \nbe useful for determining a number of other circuit parameters. Parameters such as, peak inductor or peak \nswitch current, minimum load current before the circuit becomes discontinuous, output ripple voltage and output \ncapacitor ESR can all be calculated from the peak-to-peak ΔIIND. When the inductor nomographs shown in \nFigure 9-5  through Figure 9-8  are used to select an inductor value, the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current \ncan immediately be determined. Figure 9-9  shows the range of ( ΔIIND) that can be expected for different load \ncurrents. Figure 9-9  also shows how the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current ( ΔIIND) changes as the designer \ngoes from the lower border to the upper border (for a given load current) within an inductance region. The upper \nborder represents a higher input voltage, while the lower border represents a lower input voltage (see Section \n9.1.4 ).\nThese curves are only correct for continuous mode operation, and only if the inductor selection guides are used \nto select the inductor value.\nConsider the following example:\nVOUT = 5 V, maximum load current of 300 mA\nVIN = 15 V, nominal, varying between 11 V and 20 V\nThe selection guide in Figure 9-6  shows that the vertical line for a 0.3-A load current and the horizontal line \nfor the 15-V input voltage intersect approximately midway between the upper and lower borders of the 150- μH \ninductance region. A 150- μH inductor allows a peak-to-peak inductor current ( ΔIIND) to flow a percentage of the \nmaximum load current. Referring to Figure 9-9 , follow the 0.3-A line approximately midway into the inductance \nregion, and read the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current (ΔI IND) on the left hand axis (approximately 150 mA p-p).\nAs the input voltage increases to 20 V, it approaches the upper border of the inductance region, and the inductor \nripple current increases. Figure 9-9  shows that for a load current of 0.3 A, the peak-to-peak inductor ripple \ncurrent (ΔI IND) is 150 mA with 15V in, and can range from 175 mA at the upper border (20 V in) to 120 mA at the \nlower border (11 V in).\nAfter the ΔIIND value is known, the following formulas can be used to calculate additional information about the \nswitching regulator circuit.\n1.Peak Inductor or peak switch current\n2.Minimum load current before the circuit becomes discontinuous\n3.Output Ripple VoltageLM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\n•= (ΔI IND) × (ESR of C OUT)\n•= 0.150 A × 0.240 Ω = 36 mV p-p\n•or\n4.ESR of C OUT\n9.1.6 Open Core Inductors\nAnother possible source of increased output ripple voltage or unstable operation is from an open core inductor. \nFerrite bobbin or stick inductors have magnetic lines of flux flowing through the air from one end of the bobbin \nto the other end.

The strength of the magnetic field, the orientation and location of the PC \ncopper trace to the magnetic field, and the distance between the copper trace and the inductor, determine the \namount of voltage generated in the copper trace. Another way of looking at this inductive coupling is to consider \nthe PCB copper trace as one turn of a transformer (secondary) with the inductor winding as the primary. Many \nmillivolts can be generated in a copper trace located near an open core inductor which can cause stability \nproblems or high output ripple voltage problems.\nIf unstable operation is seen, and an open core inductor is used, it is possible that the location of the inductor \nwith respect to other PC traces can be the problem. To determine if this is the problem, temporarily raise the \ninductor away from the board by several inches and then check circuit operation. If the circuit now operates \ncorrectly, then the magnetic flux from the open core inductor is causing the problem. Substituting a closed core \ninductor such as a torroid or E-core corrects the problem, or re-arranging the PC layout can be necessary. \nMagnetic flux cutting the IC device ground trace, feedback trace, or the positive or negative traces of the output \ncapacitor must be minimized.\nSometimes, locating a trace directly beneath a bobbin inductor provides good results, provided it is exactly in the \ncenter of the inductor (because the induced voltages cancel themselves out), but if it is off center one direction \nor the other, then problems can arise. If flux problems are present, even the direction of the inductor winding can \nmake a difference in some circuits.\nThis discussion on open core inductors is not to frighten the user, but to alert the user on what kind of problems \nto watch out for when using them. Open core bobbin or stick inductors are an inexpensive, simple way of making \na compact efficient inductor, and they are used by the millions in many different applications.\n9.2 Typical Applications\n9.2.1 Series Buck Regulator (Fixed Output)\nSelect components with higher voltage ratings for designs using the LM2594HV with an input voltage between \n40 V and 60 V.\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nCIN — 68-μF, 35-V, Aluminum Electrolytic Nichicon “PL Series” C OUT — 120-μF, 25-V Aluminum Electrolytic, Nichicon “PL Series” D1 — \n1-A, 40-V Schottky Rectifier, 1N5819 L1 — 100-μH, L20\nFigure 9-10.

For all other voltages, see Section 9.2.2.2  for the adjustable version.\nUse the inductor selection guide for the 5-V version shown in Figure 9-6 .\n2.From the inductor value selection guide, identify the inductance region intersected by the maximum input \nvoltage line and the maximum load current line. Each region is identified by an inductance value and an \ninductor code (LXX).\nFrom the inductor value selection guide shown in Figure 9-6 , the inductance region intersected by the 12-V \nhorizontal line and the 0.4-A vertical line is 100 μH, and the inductor code is L20.\n3.Select an appropriate inductor from the four manufacturer\'s part numbers listed in Table 9-3 .\nThe inductance value required is 100 μH. See row L20 of Table 9-3  and choose an inductor part number \nfrom any of the four manufacturers shown. (In most instance, both through-hole and surface-mount inductors \nare available.)\n9.2.1.2.3 Output Capacitor Selection (C OUT)\n1.In the majority of applications, low ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) electrolytic capacitors between 82 μF \nand 220 μF and low-ESR, solid tantalum capacitors between 15 μF and 100 μF provide the best results. This \ncapacitor must be located close to the IC using short capacitor leads and short copper traces. Do not use \ncapacitors larger than 220 μF. For additional information, see Section 9.1.2 .\n2.To simplify the capacitor selection procedure, see Figure 9-8  for quick design component selection. This \ntable contains different input voltages, output voltages, and load currents, and lists various inductors and \noutput capacitors that provides the best design solutions.\nFrom Figure 9-8 , locate the 5-V output voltage section. In the load current column, choose the load current \nline that is closest to the current required for the application; for this example, use the 0.5-A line. In the LM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\nmaximum input voltage column, select the line that covers the input voltage required for the application; in \nthis example, use the 15-V line. The rest of this line shows the recommended inductors and capacitors that \nprovides the best overall performance.\nThe capacitor list contains both through hole electrolytic and surface mount tantalum capacitors from four \ndifferent capacitor manufacturers. TI recommends using both the manufacturers and the manufacturer\'s \nseries that are listed in Table 9-5 .\nIn this example, aluminum electrolytic capacitors from several different manufacturers are available with the \nrange of ESR numbers needed:\n\u2003\u2003120-μF,\u20032-5V\u2003Panasonic HFQ Series\n\u2003\u2003120-μF,\u20032-5V\u2003Nichicon PL Series\n3.The capacitor voltage rating for electrolytic capacitors must be at least 1.5 times greater than the output \nvoltage, and often require much higher voltage ratings to satisfy the low ESR requirements for low output \nripple voltage.\nFor a 5-V output, a capacitor voltage rating at least 7.5 V or more is required. But, in this example, even a \nlow ESR, switching grade, 120-μF, 10-V aluminum electrolytic capacitor can exhibit approximately 400 mΩ of \nESR (see Figure 9-2  for the ESR vs voltage rating). This amount of ESR can result in relatively high output \nripple voltage. To reduce the ripple to 1% of the output voltage, or less, a capacitor with a higher voltage \nrating (lower ESR) must be selected. A 16-V or 25-V capacitor reduces the ripple voltage by approximately \nhalf.\n9.2.1.2.4 Catch Diode Selection (D1)\n1.The catch diode current rating must be at least 1.3 times greater than the maximum load current. Also, if the \npower supply design must withstand a continuous output short, the diode must have a current rating equal \nto the maximum current limit of the LM2594. The most stressful condition for this diode is an overload or \nshorted output condition.\nSee Table 9-2 . In this example, a 1-A, 20-V, 1N5817 Schottky diode provides the best performance, and is \nnot overstressed even for a shorted output.\n2.The reverse voltage rating of the diode must be at least 1.25 times the maximum input voltage.\n3.This diode must be fast (short reverse recovery time) and must be located close to the LM2594 using short \nleads and short printed circuit traces. Because of their fast switching speed and low forward voltage drop, \nSchottky diodes provide the best performance and efficiency, and must be the first choice, especially in \nlow output voltage applications. Ultra-fast recovery, or high-efficiency rectifiers also provide good results. \nUltra-fast recovery diodes typically have reverse recovery times of 50 ns or less. Rectifiers such as the \n1N4001 must not be used because they are too slow.\n9.2.1.2.5 Input Capacitor (C IN)\nA low ESR aluminum or tantalum bypass capacitor is needed between the input pin and ground to prevent large \nvoltage transients from appearing at the input. In addition, the RMS current rating of the input capacitor must \nbe selected to be at least ½ the DC load current. The capacitor manufacturers data sheet must be checked to \nassure that this current rating is not exceeded. Figure 9-1  shows typical RMS current ratings for several different \naluminum electrolytic capacitor values.\nThis capacitor must be located close to the IC using short leads and the voltage rating must be approximately \n1.5 times the maximum input voltage.\nIf solid tantalum input capacitors are used, TI recommends that they be surge current tested by the \nmanufacturer.\nUse caution when using ceramic capacitors for input bypassing, because it can cause severe ringing at the V IN \npin.\nThe important parameters for the Input capacitor are the input voltage rating and the RMS current rating. With a \nnominal input voltage of 12 V, an aluminum electrolytic capacitor with a voltage rating greater than 18 V\n(1.5 × V IN) is necessary. The next higher capacitor voltage rating is 25 V.\nwww.ti.comLM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\nThe RMS current rating requirement for the input capacitor in a buck regulator is approximately ½ the DC load \ncurrent. In this example, with a 400-mA load, a capacitor with a RMS current rating of at least 200 mA is needed. \nFigure 9-1  can be used to select an appropriate input capacitor. From the curves, locate the 25-V line and note \nwhich capacitor values have RMS current ratings greater than 200 mA. Either a 47- μF or 68- μF, 25-V capacitor \ncan be used.\nFor a through hole design, a 68- μF, 25-V electrolytic capacitor (Panasonic HFQ series or Nichicon PL series \nor equivalent) can be adequate. Other types or other manufacturers\' capacitors can be used provided the RMS \nripple current ratings are adequate.\nFor surface-mount designs, solid tantalum capacitors are recommended. The TPS series available from AVX, \nand the 593D series from Sprague are both surge current tested.\nFor additional information, see Section 9.1.1 .\nTable 9-5.

For additional information, see Section 9.1.2 .\n2.To simplify the capacitor selection procedure, see Table 9-7  for a quick design guide. This table contains \ndifferent output voltages, and lists various output capacitors that provides the best design solutions.\nFrom Table 9-7 , locate the output voltage column. From that column, locate the output voltage closest to \nthe output voltage in your application. In this example, select the 24-V line. Under Section 9.1.2 , select \na capacitor from the list of through hole electrolytic or surface mount tantalum types from four different \ncapacitor manufacturers.

In this example, either a 35-V or \n50-V capacitor can work. A 50-V rating was chosen because it has a lower ESR which provides a lower \noutput ripple voltage.\nOther manufacturers or other types of capacitors can also be used, provided the capacitor specifications \n(especially the 100-kHz ESR) closely match the types listed in Table 9-7 . Refer to the capacitor \nmanufacturers data sheet for this information.\n9.2.2.2.4 Feedforward Capacitor (C FF)\nFor output voltages greater than approximately 10 V, an additional capacitor is required. The compensation \ncapacitor is typically between 50 pF and 10 nF, and is wired in parallel with the output voltage setting resistor, \nR2. It provides additional stability for high output voltages, low input or output voltages, and very low ESR output \ncapacitors, such as solid tantalum capacitors calculated with Equation 7 .\n(7)\nThis capacitor type can be ceramic, plastic, silver mica, and so forth (because of the unstable characteristics of \nceramic capacitors made with Z5U material, they are not recommended).\nTable 9-7  contains feedforward capacitor values for various output voltages.

Because of their fast switching speed and low forward voltage drop, \nSchottky diodes provide the best performance and efficiency, and must be the first choice, especially in low \noutput voltage applications. Ultra-fast recovery or high-efficiency rectifiers are also good choices, but some \ntypes with an abrupt turnoff characteristic can cause instability or EMl problems. Ultra-fast recovery diodes \ntypically have reverse recovery times of 50 ns or less. Rectifiers such as the 1N4001 series must not be \nused because they are too slow.\n9.2.2.2.6 Input Capacitor (C IN)\nA low ESR aluminum or tantalum bypass capacitor is required between the input pin and ground to prevent large \nvoltage transients from appearing at the input. In addition, the RMS current rating of the input capacitor must \nbe selected to be at least ½ the DC load current. The capacitor manufacturers data sheet must be checked to \nassure that this current rating is not exceeded.

With \na nominal input voltage of 28 V, an aluminum electrolytic aluminum electrolytic capacitor with a voltage rating \ngreater than 42 V (1.5 × V IN) is required. Because the next higher capacitor voltage rating is 50 V, a 50-V \ncapacitor must be used. The capacitor voltage rating of (1.5 × V IN) is a conservative guideline, and can be \nmodified somewhat if desired.\nThe RMS current rating requirement for the input capacitor of a buck regulator is approximately ½ the DC load \ncurrent. In this example, with a 400 mA load, a capacitor with a RMS current rating of at least 200 mA is needed.\nFigure 9-1  shows curves that can be used to select an appropriate input capacitor. From the curves, locate the \n50-V line and note which capacitor values have RMS current ratings greater than 200 mA. A 47- μF, 50-V low \nESR electrolytic capacitor is needed.\nFor a through-hole design, a 47- μF, 50-V electrolytic capacitor (Panasonic HFQ series or Nichicon PL series or \nequivalent) can be adequate.

Horizontal Time Base: 50 μs/div\n9.3 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe LM2594 is designed to operate from an input voltage supply up to 45 V and 60 V (HV version). This input \nsupply must be well regulated and able to withstand maximum input current and maintain a stable voltage.\n9.4 Layout\n9.4.1 Layout Guidelines\nAs in any switching regulator, layout is very important. Rapidly switching currents associated with wiring \ninductance can generate voltage transients which can cause problems. For minimal inductance and ground \nloops, the wires indicated by heavy lines must be wide printed circuit traces and must be kept as short as \npossible. For best results, external components must be placed as close to the switcher lC as possible using \nground plane construction or single point grounding.\nIf open core inductors are used, special care must be taken as to the location and positioning of this type of \ninductor. Allowing the inductor flux to intersect sensitive feedback, lC groundpath and C OUT wiring can cause \nproblems.\nWhen using the adjustable version, take special care regarding as to the location of the feedback resistors and \nthe associated wiring. Physically place both resistors near the IC, and route the wiring away from the inductor, \nespecially an open core type of inductor.\nwww.ti.comLM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\n9.4.2 Layout Example\nCIN = 10-μ F, 35-V, Solid Tantalum AVX, TPS series C OUT = 00-μ F, 10-V Solid Tantalum AVX, TPS series D1 = 1-A, 40-V Schottky \nRectifier, surface mount L1 = 100-μH, L20, Coilcraft DO33\nFigure 9-16.

Typical Surface-Mount PCB Layout, Adjustable Output (2X Size)\n9.4.3 Thermal Considerations\nThe LM2594xx is available in two packages: an 8-pin through-hole PDIP and an 8-pin surface-mount SOIC. Both \npackages are molded plastic with a copper lead frame. When the package is soldered to the printed-circuit board \n(PCB), the copper and the board are the heat sink for the LM2594 and the other heat producing components.\nFor best thermal performance, wide copper traces must be used and all ground and unused pins must be \nsoldered to generous amounts of PCB copper, such as a ground plane (one exception to this is the output \n(switch pin, which must not have large areas of copper). Large areas of copper provide the best transfer of heat \n(lower thermal resistance) to the surrounding air, and even double-sided or multilayer boards provide a better \nheat path to the surrounding air. Unless power levels are small, sockets are not recommended because of the \nadded thermal resistance it adds and the resultant higher junction temperatures.\nPackage thermal resistance and junction temperature rise numbers are all approximate, and there are many \nfactors that affects the junction temperature. Some of these factors include board size, shape, thickness, \nposition, location, and even board temperature. Other factors are trace width, printed-circuit copper area, copper \nthickness, single- or double-sided multilayer board, and the amount of solder on the board. The effectiveness of \nthe PCB to dissipate heat also depends on the size, quantity, and spacing of other components on the board. \nFurthermore, some of these components such as the catch diode adds heat to the PCB and the heat can vary \nas the input voltage changes. For the inductor, depending on the physical size, type of core material, and the DC \nresistance, it can either act as a heat sink taking heat away from the board, or it can add heat to the board.LM2594, LM2594HV\nSNVS118F – DECEMBER 1999 – REVISED MAY 2023\n www.ti.com\n32 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2594  LM2594HV\nCircuit Data for Temperature Rise Curve (8-Pin PDIP)\nCapacitors Through hole electrolytic\nInductor Through hole, Schott, 100 μH\nDiode Through hole, 1-A, 40-V, Schottky\nPCB 4 square inches single sided 2 oz. copper (0.0028″)\nFigure 9-18.
