A ferroelectric random access\nmemory or F-RAM is nonvolatile and performs reads and writes\nsimilar to a RAM. It provides reliable data retention for 151 y ears\nwhile eliminating the complexities, overhead, and system-level\nreliability problems caused by serial flash, EEPROM, and other\nnonvolatile memories. \nUnlike serial flash and EEPROM, the CY15B104Q performs\nwrite operations at bus speed. N o write delays are incurred. Da ta\nis written to the me mory array immediately after each byte is\nsuccessfully transferred to the device. The next bus cycle can\ncommence without the need for data polling. In addition, theproduct offers substantial write endurance compared to other\nnonvolatile memories. The CY15B 104Q is capable of supporting\n1014 read/write cycles, or 100 million times more write cycles\nthan EEPROM. \nThese capabilities make the CY15B104Q ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications, requirin g frequent or rapid writes.\nExamples range from data collection, where the number of write\ncycles may be critical, to demandi ng industrial controls where the\nlong write time of serial flash  or EEPROM can cause data loss. \nThe CY15B104Q provides substantial benefits to users of serial\nEEPROM or flash as a hardware drop-in replacement. The\nCY15B104Q uses the high-spee d SPI bus, which enhances the\nhigh-speed write capability of F-RAM technology. The deviceincorporates a read-only Device ID that allows the host to\ndetermine the manufacturer, product density, and product\nrevision.

The memory array\nis logically organized as 524,288 × 8 bits and is accessed usin g\nan industry-standard serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus. Thefunctional operation of the F-RAM is similar to serial flash an d\nserial EEPROMs. The major difference between the\nCY15B104Q and a serial flash o r EEPROM with the same pinout\nis the F-RAM\'s superior write p erformance, high endurance, and\nlow power consumption. \nMemory Architecture\nWhen accessing the CY15B104Q, the user addresses 512K\nlocations of eight data bits each. These eight data bits are sh ifted\nin or out serially. The addresses are accessed using the SPIprotocol, which includes a chip select (to permit multiple devi ces\non the bus), an opcode, and a three-byte address. The upper 5\nbits of the address range are \'don\'t care\' values. The completeaddress of 19 bits specifies  each byte address uniquely. \nMost functions of the CY15B104Q are either controlled by the\nSPI interface or handled by on-board circuitry. The access time\nfor the memory operation is ess entially zero, beyond the time\nneeded for the serial protocol. That is, the memory is read orwritten at the speed of the SPI bus. Unlike a serial flash or\nEEPROM, it is not necessary to poll the device for a ready\ncondition because writes occur at bus speed. By the time a newbus transaction can be shifted into the device, a write operati on\nis complete. This is explained in more detail in the interface\nsection. \nSerial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Bus\nThe CY15B104Q is an SPI slave d evice and operates at speeds\nup to 40 MHz. This high-speed serial bus provides high-perfor-\nmance serial communication to an SPI master. Many common\nmicrocontrollers have hardware SPI ports allowing a directinterface. It is simple to emulate the port using ordinary port  pins\nfor microcontrollers that do not. The CY15B104Q operates in SPI\nMode 0 and 3. \nSPI Overview\nThe SPI is a four-pin interface with Chip Select (CS ), Serial Input\n(SI), Serial Output (SO), a nd Serial Clock (SCK) pins. \nThe SPI is a synchronous serial interface, which uses clock and\ndata pins for memory access and supports multiple devices on\nthe data bus. A device on the SP I bus is activate d using the CS\npin. \nThe relationship between chip select, clock, and data is dictat ed\nby the SPI mode. This device supports SPI modes 0 and 3. Inboth of these modes, data is clocked into the F-RAM on the risi ng\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS\n goes\nactive. \nThe SPI protocol is controlled by opcodes. These opcodes\nspecify the commands from the bus master to the slave device.After CS\n i s  a c t i v a t e d ,  t h e  f i r s t  b yte transferred from the busmaster is the opcode. Followin g the opcode, any addresses and\ndata are then transferred. The CS  must go inactive after an\noperation is complete and before a new opcode can be issued.The commonly used terms in the SPI protocol are as follows:\nSPI Master\nThe SPI master device controls the operations on the SPI bus.\nAn SPI bus may have only one master with one or more slavedevices. All the slaves share the same SPI bus lines and the\nmaster may select any of the slave devices using the CS\n pin. All\nof the operations must be initiated by the master activating aslave device by pulling the CS\n pin of the slave LOW. The master\nalso generates the SCK and all the data transmission on SI and\nSO lines are synchroni zed with this clock. \nSPI Slave\nThe SPI slave device is activated  by the master through the Chi p\nSelect line. A slave device gets the SCK as an input from the S PI\nmaster and all the communicat ion is synchronized with this\nclock. An SPI slave never initiates a communication on the SPI\nbus and acts only on the inst ruction from the master.\nThe CY15B104Q operates as an SPI slave and may share the\nSPI bus with other SPI slave devices. \nChip Select (CS )\nTo select any slave device, the master needs to pull down the\ncorresponding CS  pin. Any instruction can be issued to a slave\ndevice only while the CS  pin is LOW. When the device is not\nselected, data through the SI pin is ignored and the serial out put\npin (SO) remains in a high-impedance state.\nNote  A new instruction must begin with the falling edge of CS .\nTherefore, only one opcode can be issued for each active ChipSelect cycle.\nSerial Clock (SCK)\nThe serial clock is generated by the SPI master and the commu-\nnication is synchronized with this cl ock after CS\n goes LOW.\nThe CY15B104Q enables SPI modes 0 and 3 for data commu-\nnication. In both of these modes, the inputs are latched by the\nslave device on the rising edge of SCK and outputs are issued\non the falling edge. Therefore, the first rising edge of SCKsignifies the arrival of the first Most Significant Bit (MSB) o f an\nSPI instruction on the SI pin. Further, all data inputs and out puts\nare synchronized with SCK.\nData Transmission (SI/SO)\nThe SPI data bus consists of two lines, SI and SO, for serial d ata\ncom munication.  SI is also referred to as M ast er  Out Slave I n(MOSI) and SO is referred to as Master In Slave Out (MISO). The\nmaster issues instructions to the slave through the SI pin, whi le\nthe slave responds through the SO pin. Multiple slave devicesmay share the SI and SO lines as described earlier.\nThe CY15B104Q has two separate pins for SI and SO, which can\nbe connected with the master as shown in Figure 3 .\nDocument Number: 001-94240 Rev. *E Page 5 of 22\nCY15B104Q\nFor a microcontroller that has no dedicated SPI bus, a\ngeneral-purpose port may be used. To reduce hardware\nresources on the controller, it is possible to connect the two data\npins (SI, SO) together and tie off (HIGH) the HOLD  and WP  pins.\nFigure 4  shows such a configuration,  which uses only three pins.\nMost Significant Bit (MSB)\nThe SPI protocol requires that the first bit to be transmitted is the\nMost Significant Bit (MSB). This is valid for both address and\ndata transmission. \nThe 4-Mbit serial F-RAM require s a 3-byte address for any read\nor write operation. Because the address is only 19 bits, the fi rst\nfive bits, which are fed in are ignored by the device. Althoughthese five bits are ‘don’t care ’, Cypress recommends that these\nbits be set to 0s to enable seamless transition to higher memor y\ndensities.Serial Opcode\nAfter the slave device  is selected with CS\n going LOW, the first\nbyte received is treated as the opcode for the intended operati on.\nCY15B104Q uses the standard o pcodes for memory accesses.\nInvalid Opcode\nIf an invalid opcode is received, the opcode is ignored and the\ndevice ignores any additional serial data on the SI pin until t he\nnext falling edge of CS , and the SO pin remains tristated.\nStatus Register\nCY15B104Q has an 8-bit Status Re gister. The bits in the Status\nRegister are used to configure the device. These bits are\ndescribed in Table 3 on page 7 .\nSPI Modes\nCY15B104Q may be driven by a microcontroller with its SPI\nperipheral running in either  of the following two modes:\n■SPI Mode 0 (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)\n■SPI Mode 3 (CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1)\nFor both these modes, the input data is latched in on the risin g\nedge of SCK starting from the first rising edge after CS  goes\nactive. If the clock starts from a HIGH state (in mode 3), the first\nrising edge after the clock toggles is considered. The output d ata\nis available on the falling edge of SCK. The two SPI modes are shown in Figure 5  and Figure 6 on page\n6. The status of the clock when the bus master is not transferri ng\ndata is:\n■SCK remains at 0 for Mode 0 \n■SCK remains at 1 for Mode 3 \nThe device detects the SPI mode from the status of the SCK pin\nwhen the device is selected by bringing the CS  pin LOW. If the\nSCK pin is LOW when the device is selected, SPI Mode 0 is\nassumed and if the SCK pin is  HIGH, it works in SPI Mode 3.Figure 3.

These\nopcodes control the function s performed by the memory.WREN - Set Write Enable Latch\nThe CY15B104Q will power up with writes disabled. The WREN\ncommand must be issued before any write operation. Sending\nthe WREN opcode allows the user to issue subsequent opcodesfor write operations. These incl ude writing the Status Register\n(WRSR) and writing the memory (WRITE). \nSending the WREN opcode causes the internal Write Enable\nLatch to be set. A flag bit in the Status Register, called WEL,\nindicates the state of the latch.  WEL = ’1’ indicates that writ es are\npermitted. Attempting to write the WEL bit in the Status Regist er\nhas no effect on the state of this bit – only the WREN opcode c an\nset this bit. The WEL bit will be automatically cleared on the rising\nedge of CS\n following a WRDI, a WRSR, or a WRITE operation.\nThis prevents further writes to the Status Register or the F-RA M\narray without another WREN command. Figure 7  illustrates the\nWREN command bus configuration.\nWRDI - Reset Write Enable Latch\nThe WRDI command disables all write activity by clearing theWrite Enable Latch. T he user can verify that  writes are disable d\nby reading the WEL bit in the Status Register and verifying tha t\nWEL is equal to ‘0’. Figure 8  illustrates the WRDI command bus\nconfiguration.Figure 5.  SPI Mode 0\nFigure 6.  SPI Mode 3\nTable 1.

The Status Regist er is\norganized as follows. (The defa ult value shipped from the facto ry for WEL, BP0, BP1, bits 4–5, W PEN is ‘0’, and  for bit 6 is ‘ 1’.)\nBits 0 and 4–5 are fixed at ‘0’ and bit 6 is fixed at ‘1’; none  of these\nbits can be modified. Note that b it 0 ("Ready or Write in progr ess”\nbit in serial flash and EEPROM) is unnecessary, as the F-RAM\nwrites in real-time and is never busy, so it reads out as a ‘0’ . An\nexception to this is when the device is waking up from sleep\nmode, which is described in Sleep Mode on page 10 . The BP1\nand BP0 control the software write-protection features and arenonvolatile bits. The WEL flag indicates the state of the Write\nEnable Latch. Attempting to directly write the WEL bit in the\nStatus Register has no effect on its state. This bit is interna lly set\nand cleared via the WREN and WRDI commands, respectively. \nBP1 and BP0 are memory block write protection bits. They\nspecify portions of m emory that are write-protected as shown in\nTable 4 .\nThe BP1 and BP0 bits and the Write Enable Latch are the only\nmechanisms that protect the memo ry from writes. The remaining\nwrite protection features protect inadvertent changes to the bl ock\nprotect bits. \nThe write protect enable bit (WPEN) in the Status Register\ncontrols the effect of the hardware write protect (WP\n) pin. When\nthe WPEN bit is set to \'0\', the status of the WP  pin is ignored.\nWhen the WPEN bit is set to \'1\', a LOW on the WP  pin inhibits a\nwrite to the Status Register. Thus the Status Register iswrite-protected only when WPEN = \'1\' and WP  =  \' 0 \' .  Table 5\nsummarizes the write protection conditions.\nRead Status Register (RDSR)\nThe RDSR command allows the bus master to verify thecontents of the Status Register. Reading the status register\nprovides information about the current state of the\nwrite-protection features. Fo llowing the RDSR opcode, the\nCY15B104Q will return one byte with the contents of the Status\nRegister. \nWrite Status Register (WRSR)\nThe WRSR command allows the SPI bus master to write into the\nStatus Register and change the write protect configuration bysetting the WPEN, BP0 and BP1 bits as required. Before issuing\na WRSR command, the WP\n pin must be HIGH or inactive. Note\nthat on the CY15B104Q, WP  only prevents writing to the Status\nRegister, not the memory array. Before sending the WRSRcommand, the user must send a WREN command to enable\nwrites. Executing a WRSR command is a write operation and\ntherefore, clears th e Write Enable Latch.Table 2.

No page register is needed andany number of sequential writes may be performed. \nWrite Operation\nAll writes to the memory begin with a WREN opcode with CS\nbeing asserted and deasserted. The next opcode is WRITE. TheWRITE opcode is followed by a three-byte address containingthe 19-bit address (A18–A0) of the first data byte to be writte n\ninto the memory. The upper five bits of the three-byte address\nare ignored. Subsequent bytes are data bytes, which are writtensequentially. Addresses are incremented internally as long as\nthe bus master continues to  issue clocks and keeps CS\n LOW. If\nthe last address of 7FFFFh is reached, the counter will roll ov er\nto 00000h. Data is written MSB first. The rising edge of CS  termi-\nnates a write operation. A write operation is shown in Figure 11 .\nNote  When a burst write reaches a protected block address, the\nautomatic address incr ement stops and all the subsequent data\nbytes received for  write will be ignored by the device.\nEEPROMs use page buffers to increase their write throughput.\nThis compensates for the technology\'s inherently slow write\noperations. F-RAM memories do not have page buffers becauseeach byte is written to the F-RAM array immediately after it is\nclocked in (after the eighth clock). This allows any number of\nbytes to be written wit hout page buffer delays.\nNote  If the power is lost in the middle of the write operation, onl y\nthe last completed b yte will be written.Read Operation\nAfter the falling edge of CS , the bus master can issue a READ\nopcode. Following the READ command is a three-byte address\ncontaining the 19-bit address (A18–A0) of the first byte of the\nread operation. The upper five bits of the address are ignored.After the opcode and address are issued, the device drives out\nthe read data on the next eight clocks. The SI input is ignored\nduring read data bytes. Subsequent bytes are data bytes, whichare read out sequentially. Addresses are incremented internally\nas long as the bus master continues to issue clocks and CS\n is\nLOW. If the last address of 7FF FFh is reached, the counter will\nroll over to 00000h. Data is read MSB first. The rising edge of  CS\nterminates a read operation and tristates the SO pin. A read\noperation is shown in  Figure 12 .\nFast Read Operation\nThe CY15B104Q supports a FAST READ opcode (0Bh) that is\nprovided for code compatibility with serial flash devices. The\nFAST READ opcode is followed by a three-byte address\ncontaining the 19-bit address (A18–A0) of the first byte of theread operation and then a dummy byte. The dummy byte insertsa read latency of 8-clock cycle. The fast read operation is\notherwise the same as an ordinary read operation except that it\nrequires an additional dummy byte. After receiving the opcode,address, and a dummy byte, the  CY15B104Q starts driving its\nSO line with data bytes, with MSB first, and continues trans-\nmitting as long as the device is selected and the clock isavailable. In case of bulk read, the internal address counter i s\nincremented automatically, and after the last address 7FFFFh is\nreached, the counter rolls over to 00000h. When the device isdriving data on its SO line, any transition on its SI line is i gnored.\nThe rising edge of CS\n terminates a fast read operation and\ntristates the SO pin. A Fast Read operation is shown in Figure 13 .Figure 9.  RDSR Bu s Configuration\nFigure 10.

If the bus master pulls the HOLD  pin LOW while SCK is\nLOW, the current operation wil l pause. Taking the HOLD  pin HIGH while SCK is LOW will resume an operation. The transi tions of\nHOLD  must occur while SCK is LOW, but the SCK and CS  pin can toggle during a hold state.\nSleep Mode\nA low-power sleep mode is implemented on the CY15B104Q\ndevice. The device will enter the low-power state when the\nSLEEP opcode B9h is clocked i n and a rising edge of CS  is\napplied. When in sleep mode, the SCK and SI pins are ignoredand SO will be HI-Z, but the de vice continues to monitor the CSpin. On the next falling edge of CS , the device will return to\nnormal operation within tREC time. The SO pin remains in a HI-Z\nstate during the wakeup period.  The device does not necessarily\nrespond to an opcode within the wakeup period. To start thewakeup procedure, the controller may send a “dummy” read, for\nexample, and wait the remaining t\nREC time.Figure 14.

The RDID opcode 9Fh a llows\nthe user to read the manufacture r ID and product ID, both of wh ich are read-only bytes. The JEDEC-assigned manufacturer ID pla ces\nthe Cypress (Ramtron) identifie r in bank 7; therefore, there ar e six bytes of the continuation code 7Fh followed by the single  byte C2h.\nThere are two bytes of product ID, which includes a family code , a density code, a sub code, and the product revision code.\nEndurance\nThe CY15B104Q devices are capable of being accessed at least\n1014 times, reads or writes. An F -RAM memory operates with a\nread and restore mechanism. Therefore, an endurance cycle is\napplied on a row basis for each access (read or write) to the\nmemory array. The F-RAM architecture is based on an array ofrows and columns of 32K rows of 64-bits each. The entire row is\ninternally accessed once, whether  a single byte or all eight by tes\nare read or written. Each byte in the row is counted only once in\nan endurance calculation. Table 7  shows endurance calculations\nfor a 64-byte repeating loop, which includes an opcode, a start ing\naddress, and a sequential 64-byte data stream. This causeseach byte to experience one endurance cycle through the loop.\nF-RAM read and write endurance  is virtually unlimited even at a\n40-MHz clock rate.Table 6.
