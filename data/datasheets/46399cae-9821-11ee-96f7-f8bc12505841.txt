Confidential- Prepared for Customer Use Only 10 \nSY8286A \n \n \nOperation \n \nThe SY8286A develops a high efficiency synchronous \nstep-down DC-DC regulator capable of delivering 6A \ncurrent. The device integrates main switch and \nsynchronous switch with very low R DS(ON)  to minimize \nthe conduction loss. \n \nThe SY8286A operates over a wide input voltage range \nfrom 4V to 23V. The DC-DC regulator adopts the instant \nPWM architecture to achieve fast transient responses for high step down applications and high efficiency at light load. The device provides various protection features for \nreliable operation. In addition, it operates at pseudo-\nconstant frequency of 600kHz to minimize the size of inductor and capacitor. \n \nApplications Information \n \nBecause of the high integration in the SY8286A IC, the \napplication circuit based on this regulator IC is rather \nsimple. Only input capacitor C IN, output capacitor C OUT, \noutput inductor L and feedback resistors (R 1 and R 2) \nneed to be selected for the targeted applications \nspecifications. \n \nFeedback resistor dividers R 1 and R 2:  \nChoose R 1 and R 2 to program the proper output voltage. \nTo minimize the power consumption under light load, it \nis desirable to choose large resistance values for bo h R 1 \nand R 2. A value of between 10k Ω and 1MΩ is highly \nrecommended for both resistors. If Vout is 1.2V, \nR1=100k is chosen, then using following equat on, R 2 \ncan be calculated to be 100k Ω:  \n     VOUT\n     \nR1      \n     \nR2 = 0.6V \nR1 . 0.6V FB     \n  \n  \nVOUT − 0.6V GND  R2     \n       \n       \n         \n \n \nInput capacitor C IN:  \nThe ripple current through input capacitor is calculated \nas：  \nICIN _ RMS  = IOUT ⋅ \nD(1− D) . \n \nTo minimize the potential noise problem, place a typical \nX5R or better grade ceramic capacitor really close to the \nIN and GND pins. Care should be taken to minimize the \nloop area formed by C IN, and IN/GND  \n \npins. In this case, a 10uF low ESR ceramic capacitor is \nrecommended. \n \nOutput capacitor C OUT:  \nThe output capacitor is selected to handle the output \nripple noise requirements. Both steady state ripple and \ntransient requirements must be taken into consideration when selecting this capacitor. For most applications, an X5R or better grade ceramic capacitor greater than 66uF \ncapacitance can work well. The capacitance derating \nwith DC voltage must be considered. \n \nOutput inductor L:   \nThere are several considerations in choosing this \ninductor.  \n1) Choose the inductance to provide the desired ripple \ncurrent. It is suggested to choose the ripple current to be about 40% of the maximum output current. The inductance is calculated as: \n \nL = V\nOUT (1−\n V\nOUT /V\nIN,MAX ) \nF\nSW ×\n I\nOUT,MAX ×\n 40% \n \nwhere Fsw is the switching frequency and I OUT,MAX  is \nthe maximum load current.  \nThe SY8286A regulator IC is quite tolerant of different \nripple current amplitude. Consequently, the final choice of inductance can be slightly off the calculation value without significantly impacting the performance. \n \n2) The saturation current rating of the inductor must be \nselected to be greater than the peak inductor current \nunder full load conditions.  \nISAT , MIN > IOUT ,MAX + VOUT (1-VOUT/VIN,MAX) \n2 ⋅ FSW ⋅ L \n \n3) The DCR of the inductor and the core loss at the \nswitching frequency must be low enough to achieve the desired efficiency requirement. It is \ndesirable to choose an inductor with DCR<10m Ω \nto achieve a good overall efficiency. \n \nCurrent limit setting   \nThe SY8286A features both cycle by cycle peak and \nvalley current limit. The high side MOSFET is turned off and low side MOSFET is turned on when peak current limit is triggered. When the valley current limit is triggered, the device will not allow high side MOSFET turning on until the valley current drops below the threshold. The valley current limit threshold is selectable by pulling ILMT pin low, high or leaves it floating. \n \n \nAN_SY8286A Rev. 0.9C Silergy Corp.

The typical soft-start time is 1.3ms. \n \n \nEnable Operation   \nPulling the EN pin low will shut down the device. \nDuring shutdown mode, the SY8286A shutdown current drops to lower than 10uA, Driving the EN pin high will turn on the IC again. \n \nExternal Bootstrap Cap   \nThis capacitor provides the gate driver voltage for internal high side MOSEFET. A 100nF low ESR ceramic capacitor connected between BS pin and LX pin is recommended. \n \nBS  \nCBS \n100nF \n \n LX \n \n \nVCC LDO and BYP Input   \nThe 3.3V VCC LDO provides the power supply for \ninternal control and drive circuit. Bypass this pin to ground with a 2.2uF ceramic capacitor. The control and drive circuit can also be powered by external 3.3V power \nsupply. When a 3.3V external power supply is connected \nto the BYP pin, the VCC LDO is turned off and the switch between BYP and VCC is turn d on. The overall efficiency may be improved by connecting the BYP pin to external 3.3V switching power supply. Leave BYP pin floating if this feature is ot used. \n \n. \n \n \n  \n \n \nPower Good Indication   \nPG is an open-drain output pin. This pin will pull to \nground if output voltage is lower than 90% or higher than 120% of egulation voltage. Otherwise this pin will go to a high impedance state.  \n \nLight Load Operation Mode Selection   \nPFM or PWM light load operation is selected by MODE \npin. Pull MODE pin low for PFM operation, and pull this pin high for PWM operation. \n \nLoad Transient Considerations:   \nThe SY8286A regulator IC adopts the instant PWM \narchitecture to achieve good stability and fast transient responses. In applications with high step load current, \nadding an RC network R\nFF and C FF parallel with R1 \nmay further speed up the load transient responses.  \nL1VOUT  \nCFF R1 \nRFF COUT \n \n(opt.)\nR2 FB \n \n \nLayout Design:   \nThe layout design of SY8286A regulator is relatively \nsimple. For the best efficiency and minimum noise \npromblem, we should place the following components \nclose to the IC: C IN, CVCC, L, R1 and R2.  \n1) It is desirable to maximize the PCB copper area \nconnecting to GND pin to achieve the best thermal and \nnoise performance. If the board space allowed, a ground plane is highly desirable. \n \n2) C\nIN must be close to Pins IN and GND. The loop area \nformed by C IN and GND must be minimized. \n \n3) The PCB copper area associated with LX pin must be \nminimized to avoid the potential noise problem. \n \n4) The components R 1 and R 2, and the trace connecting \nto the FB pin must NOT be adjacent to the LX net on the PCB layout to avoid the noise problem. \n \n5) If the system chip interfacing with the EN pin has a \nhigh impedance state at shutdown mode and the IN pin is \nconnected directly to a power source such as a Li-Ion battery. A 1M Ω pull down resistor should be placed \nbetween the enable pin and GND pins to prevent the \nnoise from falsely turning on the regulator at shutdown \nmode. \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \nAN_SY8286A Rev. 0.9C Silergy Corp.
