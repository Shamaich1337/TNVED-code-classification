The viewing\nangles are determined for the horizontal or 3, 9 o’clock direction and the vertical  or  6, 12\no’clock direction  with respect to the optical axis which is normal to the LCD surface (seeFIGURE 1).\n2. Contrast measurements shall be made at viewing angle of Ĭ= 0 and at the center of\nthe LCD surface. Luminance shall be measured  with all pixels in the view field set first to \nwhite, then to the dark (black) state .  \n (see FIGURE 1) Luminance Contrast Ratio (CR) is defined mathematically. \n3. Center Luminance of white is defined as luminance values of  5 point average across\nthe LCD surface. Luminance shall be measured with all pixels in the view field set first towhite. This measurement shall be taken at the locations shown in FIGURE 2 for a total ofthe measurements per display.\n4. The White luminance uniformity on LCD surface is then expressed as : ǻY =Minimum\nLuminance of 5(or 13) points / Maximum Luminance of  5(or 13) points.\n(see FIGURE 2 and FIGURE 3).\n5. The color chromaticity coordinates specified in Table 5 shall be calculated from the\nspectral data measured with all pixels first in red, green, blue and white.

The times needed for the luminance to\nchange from 10% to 90% is Tr, and 90% to 10% is Td.7. Cross-Talk of one area of the LCD surface by another shall be measured by comparing\nthe luminance (YA) of a 25mm diameter area, with all display pixels set to a gray level, tothe luminance (YB) of that same area when any adjacent area is driven dark.\n(See FIGURE 5).CR  = Luminance when displaying a white raster \nLuminance when displaying a black raster P0 2022.03.10\n\nPAGE REV ISSUE DATE PRODUCT GROUP \nTFT- LCD PRODUCT \n OF 33 SPEC.

Peel a protection sheet off from the LCD panel surface as slowly as possible.   y As the LCD panel and back - light element are made from fragile glass material, impulse \n    and pressure to the LCD module should be avoided.   y As the surface of the polarizer is very soft and easily scratched, use a soft dry cloth \n  without chemicals for cleaning. \n  y Do not pull the interface connector in or out while the LCD module is operating. \n  y Put the module display side down on a flat horizontal plane. \n  y Handle connectors and cables with care. \nG(3) Cautions for the operation \n y When the module is operating, do not lose CLK, ENAB signals. If any one of these \n   signals is lost, th e LCD panel woul d be damaged. \n y Obey the supply voltage sequence. If wrong sequence is applied, the module \n would be damaged.
