This is an advanced regulation topology that combines \nthe advantages of hysteretic and voltage mode control.\nThe DCS-Control topology operates in PWM (pulse width modulation) mode for medium to heavy load conditions \nand in PSM (power save mode) at light load currents. In PWM mode, the converter operates with its nominal \nswitching frequency of 2.0 MHz having a controlled frequency variation over the input voltage range. As the load \ncurrent decreases, the converter enters power save mode, reducing the switching frequency and minimizing the \nquiescent current of the IC to achieve high efficiency over the entire load current range. DCS-Control supports \nboth operation modes using a single building block and therefore has a seamless transition from PWM to PSM \nwithout effects on the output voltage. The TPS82130 offers excellent DC voltage regulation and load transient \nregulation, combined with low output voltage ripple, minimizing interference with RF circuits.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVOUT\nFB\nGNDDirect Control\nand\nCompensation\nTimer\nton\nComparatorRamp\nError Amplifier\nDCS - ControlTMMOSFET Driver\nControl LogicHigh Side\nCurrent SenseVIN\nBandgap\nUndervoltage Lockout\nThermal ShutdownENPG\nVFB\nVREF\nVREF400k Ω(1)\nNote:\n(1) When the device is enabled, the 400 k resistor is disconnected.\n(2) The integrated inductor of 1 µH in the module.ΩL(2)\nVoltage\nClampVIN\nVREFSS/TR 22pF\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 PWM and PSM Operation\nThe TPS82130 includes an on-time (t ON) circuitry. t ON, in steady-state operation in PWM and PSM modes, is \nestimated as:\nINOUT\nONVVns500 t /c180 /c61\n(1)\nIn PWM mode, the TPS82130 operates with pulse width modulation in continuous conduction mode (CCM) with \na tON shown in Equation 1  at medium and heavy load currents.

The device operates in PWM mode as long as the output current is higher than \nhalf of the ripple current of the inductor estimated by Equation 2 .\nLV VtIOUT IN\nON L/c45/c180 /c61/c68\n(2)\nTo maintain high efficiency at light loads, the device enters power save mode seamlessly when the load current \ndecreases. This happens when the load current becomes smaller than half of the ripple current of the inductor. \nIn PSM, the converter operates with reduced switching frequency and with a minimum quiescent current to \nmaintain high efficiency. PSM is also based on the t ON circuitry. The switching frequency in PSM is estimated as:\nLV V\nVVtI 2f\nOUT IN\nOUTIN 2\nONOUT\nPSM/c45/c180 /c180/c180/c61\n(3)\nIn PSM, the output voltage rises slightly above the nominal output voltage in PWM mode. This effect is reduced \nby increasing the output capacitance. The output voltage accuracy in PSM operation is reflected in Section 6.5 \nand given for a 22-µF output capacitor.\nFor very small output voltages, an absolute minimum on time of approximately 80 ns is kept to limit switching \nlosses. The operating frequency is thereby reduced from its nominal value, which keeps efficiency high. Also, the \noff time can reach its minimum value at high duty cycles. The output voltage remains regulated in such cases.\nWhen V IN decreases to typically 15% above V OUT, the TPS82130 cannot enter power save mode, regardless of \nthe load current. The device maintains output regulation in PWM mode.\n7.3.2 Low Dropout Operation (100% Duty Cycle)\nThe TPS82130 offers a low input to output voltage differential by entering 100% duty cycle mode. In this mode, \nthe high-side MOSFET switch is constantly turned on. This is particularly useful in battery powered applications \nto achieve the longest operation time by taking full advantage of the whole battery voltage range. The minimum \ninput voltage to maintain a minimum output voltage is given by:\nDP OUT (min) OUT (min)IN R I V V /c180 /c43 /c61\n(4)\nwhere\n•RDP = Resistance from V IN to V OUT, including high-side FET on-resistance and DC resistance of the inductor\n•VOUT(min)  = Minimum output voltage the load can accept\n7.3.3 Switch Current Limit\nThe switch current limit prevents the device from high inductor current and from drawing excessive current from \nthe battery or input voltage rail. Excessive current can occur with a heavy load/shorted output circuit condition. \nIf the inductor peak current reaches the switch current limit after a propagation delay of typically 30 ns, the \nhigh-side FET is turned off and the low-side FET is turned on to ramp down the inductor current.\n7.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout\nTo avoid mis-operation of the device at low input voltages, an undervoltage lockout is implemented, which shuts \ndown the device at voltages lower than V UVLO with a hysteresis of 200 mV.\n7.3.5 Thermal Shutdown\nThe device goes into thermal shutdown and stops switching once the junction temperature exceeds T JSD. Once \nthe device temperature falls below the threshold by 20°C, the device returns to normal operation automatically.TPS82130\nSLVSCY5E – FEBRUARY 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS82130\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Enable and Disable (EN)\nThe device is enabled by setting the EN pin to a logic High. Accordingly, shutdown mode is forced if the EN pin \nis pulled Low with a shutdown current of typically 1.5 μA.\nAn internal 400-kΩ  pulldown resistor is connected to the EN pin when the EN pin is Low. The pulldown resistor is \ndisconnected when the EN pin is High.\n7.4.2 Soft Start-Up (SS/TR)\nThe internal voltage clamp controls the output voltage slope during start-up. This avoids excessive inrush current \nand ensures a controlled output voltage rise time. When the EN pin is pulled high, the device starts switching \nafter a delay of typically 55 μs and the output voltage rises with a slope controlled by an external capacitor \nconnected to the SS/TR pin. Using a very small capacitor or leaving the SS/TR pin floating provides the fastest \nstart-up time.\nThe TPS82130 is able to start into a pre-biased output capacitor. During the pre-biased start-up, both the power \nMOSFETs are not allowed to turn on until the internal voltage clamp sets an output voltage above the pre-bias \nvoltage.\nWhen the device is in shutdown, undervoltage lockout, or thermal shutdown, the capacitor connected to the \nSS/TR pin is discharged by an internal resistor. Returning from those states causes a new start-up sequence.\n7.4.3 Voltage Tracking (SS/TR)\nThe SS/TR pin is externally driven by another voltage source to achieve output voltage tracking. The application \ncircuit is shown in Figure 7-1 .\nR2VOUT1\nR1TPS82130VOUT2\nR4R3\nSS/TR FB\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 7-1. Output Voltage Tracking\nWhen the SS/TR pin voltage is between 50 mV and 1.2 V, the VOUT2 tracks the VOUT1 as described in \nEquation 5 .\n4 R4 R 3 R\n2 R1 R2 R64 . 0VV\n1OUT2 OUT /c43/c180/c43/c180 /c187\n(5)\nWhen the SS/TR pin voltage is above 1.2 V, the voltage tracking is disabled and the FB pin voltage is regulated \nat 0.8 V. To decrease the SS/TR pin voltage, the device does not sink current from the output, so the resulting \ndecreases of the output voltage can be slower than the SS/TR pin voltage if the load is light. When driving the \nSS/TR pin with an external voltage, do not exceed the voltage rating of the SS/TR pin which is VIN + 0.3 V.\nDetails about tracking and sequencing circuits are found in the Sequencing and Tracking With the TPS621-\nFamily and TPS821-Family Application Report .www.ti.comTPS82130\nSLVSCY5E – FEBRUARY 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS82130\n7.4.4 Power-Good Output (PG)\nThe device has a power-good (PG) output. The PG pin goes high impedance once the output is above 95% of \nthe nominal voltage, and is driven low once the output voltage falls below typically 90% of the nominal voltage. \nThe PG pin is an open-drain output and is specified to sink up to 2 mA. The power good output requires a pullup \nresistor connecting to any voltage rail less than 6 V.\nThe PG signal can be used for sequencing of multiple rails by connecting it to the EN pin of other converters. \nLeave the PG pin floating when it is not used.

Larger currents through R2 improve noise sensitivity and output voltage accuracy. Figure 8-1  shows \nthe external resistor divider value for a 1.8-V output. Choose appropriate resistor values for other outputs.\nIn case the FB pin gets opened, the device clamps the output voltage at the VOUT pin internally to \napproximately 7 V.\n8.2.1.2.3 Input and Output Capacitor Selection\nFor the best output and input voltage filtering, low-ESR ceramic capacitors are required. The input capacitor \nminimizes input voltage ripple, suppresses input voltage spikes, and provides a stable system rail for the device. \nA 10-µF or larger input capacitor is required. The output capacitor value can range from 22 μF up to more than \n400 μF. Higher values are possible as well and can be evaluated through the transient response. Larger soft \nstart times are recommended for higher output capacitances.\nHigh capacitance ceramic capacitors have a DC bias effect, which will have a strong influence on the final \neffective capacitance. Therefore the right capacitor value has to be chosen carefully. Package size and voltage \nrating in combination with dielectric material are responsible for differences between the rated capacitor value \nand the effective capacitance.\n8.2.1.2.4 Soft Start-Up Capacitor Selection\nA capacitance connected between the SS/TR pin and the GND allows programming the start-up slope of the \noutput voltage. A constant current of 2.5 μA charges the external capacitor. The capacitance required for a given \nsoft start-up time for the output voltage is given by:\nV25 . 1It CTR / SS\nTR / SS TR / SS /c180 /c61\n(7)TPS82130\nSLVSCY5E – FEBRUARY 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS82130\n8.2.1.3 Application Performance Curves\nTA = 25°C, V IN = 12 V, V OUT = 1.8 V, unless otherwise noted.\nLoad (A)Efficiency (%)\n5060708090100\n1m 10m 100m 1 5\nD001VIN = 3.3 V\nVIN = 5.0 V\nVIN = 12 V\nFigure 8-2.

The input capacitor placement \nspecifically must be closest to the VIN and GND pins of the device.\n•Use wide and short traces for the main current paths to reduce the parasitic inductance and resistance.\n•To enhance heat dissipation of the device, the exposed thermal pad should be connected to bottom or \ninternal layer ground planes using vias.\n•Refer to Figure 10-1  for an example of component placement, routing, and thermal design.\n10.2 Layout Example\nVIN\nGNDVOUTC3\nC2C1\nVIN\nVOUTFB GNDEN\nPGSS/TR\nVOUT\nR1R2\nFigure 10-1. TPS82130 PCB Layout\n10.3 Thermal Consideration\nThe output current of the TPS82130 needs to be derated when the device operates in a high ambient \ntemperature or delivers high output power. The amount of current derating is dependent upon the input voltage, \noutput power, PCB layout design, and environmental thermal condition. Care should especially be taken in \napplications where the localized PCB temperature exceeds 65°C.\nThe TPS82130 module temperature must be kept less than the maximum rating of 125°C. Three basic \napproaches for enhancing thermal performance are below:\n•Improve the power dissipation capability of the PCB design.\n•Improve the thermal coupling of the TPS82130 to the PCB.\n•Introduce airflow into the system.\nTo estimate approximate module temperature of TPS82130, apply the typical efficiency stated in this data sheet \nto the desired application condition to find the power dissipation of the module. Then, calculate the module \ntemperature rise by multiplying the power dissipation by its thermal resistance.
