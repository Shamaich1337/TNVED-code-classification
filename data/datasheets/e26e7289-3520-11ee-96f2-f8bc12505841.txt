**Description:**
The LFCN-120+ is a low-pass filter designed for RF applications, specifically operating within a frequency range of DC to 120 MHz. Its primary function is to allow signals below a certain frequency to pass while attenuating signals above that frequency, making it ideal for harmonic rejection in VHF/UHF transmitters and receivers.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Harmonic Rejection:** The LFCN-120+ is used to suppress unwanted harmonic frequencies in RF signals, ensuring cleaner transmission and reception.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** It is commonly employed in communication systems that operate in the VHF and UHF bands, where maintaining signal integrity is crucial.
- **Signal Processing:** The filter can be utilized in various signal processing applications where frequency selection is necessary.

This component is particularly valuable in RF design due to its robust power handling capabilities and compact size, making it suitable for integration into various electronic systems.
