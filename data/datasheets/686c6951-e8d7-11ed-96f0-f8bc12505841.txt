**Description:**
The Dialight 515-1069F is an optical light pipe designed to transmit light from surface-mounted LEDs to the exterior of an enclosure. It features a circular light-emitting surface that provides bright and uniform intensity. The light pipe is secured to the printed circuit board (PCB) using two press-fit pins located between its three light pipe elements. The textured finish on the light-emitting surface enhances the viewing angle, making it suitable for applications where visibility is crucial.

**Typical Applications:**
The 515-1069F light pipe is typically used in applications requiring visual indicators, such as:
- Status indicators in electronic devices
- Control panels and dashboards
- Consumer electronics
- Industrial equipment
- Any application where light needs to be transmitted from an internal LED to an external surface for visibility.

This component is particularly compatible with Dialight's 597 Series PLCC-2 or PLCC-4 Type SMT LEDs, which are mounted in a straight line on a 0.250" pitch, making it ideal for integrated lighting solutions in various electronic designs.
