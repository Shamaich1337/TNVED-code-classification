Three standard logic options are offered – dual-inverting, dual-noninverting and one-inverting \nand one-noninverting driver. Using a design that inherently minimizes shoot-through current, these drivers \ndeliver 4A of current where it is needed most at the Miller plateau region during the MOSFET switching \ntransition. A unique Bipolar and MOSFET hybrid output stage in parallel also allows efficient current sourcing \nand sinking at low supply voltages.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n1\nOUTAN/C\n2 INA\n3 GND7N/C 8INVERTING\nNON-INVERTING\nOUTB\n45INVERTING\nNON-INVERTING INB6 VDD\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Input Stage\nThe input thresholds have a 3.3-V logic sensitivity over the full range of V DD voltage; yet it is equally compatible \nwith 0 V to V DD signals.\nThe inputs of UCC2732x and UCC3732x family of drivers are designed to withstand 500-mA reverse current \nwithout either damage to the IC for logic upset. The input stage of each driver must be driven by a signal with \na short rise or fall time. This condition is satisfied in typical power-supply applications, where the input signals \nare provided by a PWM controller or logic gates with fast transition times (<200 ns). The input stages to the \ndrivers function as a digital gate, and are not intended for applications where a slow-changing input voltage is \nused to generate a switching output when the logic threshold of the input section is reached. While this may not \nbe harmful to the driver, the output of the driver may switch repeatedly at a high frequency.\nUsers should not attempt to shape the input signals to the driver in an attempt to slow down (or delay) the signal \nat the output. If limited rise or fall times to the power device is desired, an external resistance can be added \nbetween the output of the driver and the load device, which is generally a power MOSFET gate. The external \nresistor may also help remove power dissipation from the device package, as discussed in (see Section 10.3).\nImportantly, input signal of the two channels, INA and INB, which has logic compatible threshold and hysteresis. \nIf not used, INA and INB must be tied to either VDD or GND; it must not be left floating.\n7.3.2 Output Stage\nInverting outputs of the UCCx7323 and OUTA of the UCCx7325 are intended to drive external P-channel \nMOSFETs. Noninverting outputs of the UCCx7324 and OUTB of the UCCx7325 are intended to drive external \nN-Channel MOSFETs.\nEach output stage is capable of supplying ±4-A peak current pulses and swings to both VDD and GND. \nThe pullup and pulldown circuits of the driver are constructed of bipolar and MOSFET transistors in parallel. \nwww.ti.comUCC27323, UCC27324, UCC27325, UCC37323, UCC37324, UCC37325\nSLUS492K – JUNE 2001 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: UCC27323  UCC27324  UCC27325  UCC37323  UCC37324  UCC37325\nThe peak output current rating is the combined current from the bipolar and MOSFET transistors. The output \nresistance is the R DS(on)  of the MOSFET transistor when the voltage on the driver output is less than the \nsaturation voltage of the bipolar transistor. Each output stage also provides a very low impedance to overshoot \nand undershoot due to the body diode of the external MOSFET.\nThis means that in many cases, external-Schottky-clamp diodes are not required. The UCCx732x family delivers \n4 A of gate drive where it is most needed during the MOSFET switching transition – at the Miller plateau region \n– providing improved efficiency gains. A unique Bipolar and MOSFET hybrid output stage in parallel also allows \nefficient current sourcing at low supply voltages.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\nWith VDD power supply in the range of 4.5 V to 15 V, the output stage is dependent on the states of the HI and \nLI pins.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nHigh-frequency power supplies often require high-speed, high-current drivers such as the UCCx732x family. A \nleading application is the needed to provide a high-power buffer stage between the PWM output of the control IC \nand the gates of the primary power MOSFET or IGBT switching devices. In other cases, the driver IC is used to \ndrive the power-device gates through a drive transformer. Synchronous rectification supplies are also needed to \nsimultaneously drive multiple devices which presents an extremely large load to the control circuitry.\nDriver ICs are used when having the primary PWM regulator IC directly drive the switching devices for one or \nmore reasons is not feasible. The PWMIC does not have the brute drive capability required for the intended \nswitching MOSFET, limiting the switching performance in the application. In other cases there may be a desire \nto minimize the effect of high-frequency switching noise by placing the high current driver physically close to the \nload. Also, newer ICs that target the highest operating frequencies do not incorporate onboard gate drivers at \nall. Their PWM outputs are only intended to drive the high impedance input to a driver such as the UCCx732x. \nFinally, the control IC is under thermal stress due to power dissipation, and an external driver helps by moving \nthe heat from the controller to an external package.\nwww.ti.comUCC27323, UCC27324, UCC27325, UCC37323, UCC37324, UCC37325\nSLUS492K – JUNE 2001 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: UCC27323  UCC27324  UCC27325  UCC37323  UCC37324  UCC37325\n8.2 Typical Application\nUCCx732x\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5N/C\nINA\nINBGNDN/C\nOUTA\nOUTBVDD\n0.1μFINA\nINB\n1.0μF\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-1. UCCx732x Driving Two Independent MOSFETs\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\nTo select proper device from UCCx732x family, TI recommends first checking the appropriate logic for the \noutputs. UCCx7323 has dual inverting outputs; UCCx7324 has dual noninverting outputs; UCCx7325 have \ninverting channel A and noninverting channel B. Moreover, some design considerations must be evaluated first \nin order to make the most appropriate selection. Among these considerations are VDD, drive current, and power \ndissipation.\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n8.2.2.1 Source/Sink Capabilities During Miller Plateau\nLarge power MOSFETs present a large load to the control circuitry. Proper drive is required for efficient, reliable \noperation. The UCCx732x drivers have been optimized to provide maximum drive to a power MOSFET during \nthe Miller plateau region of the switching transition. This interval occurs while the drain voltage is swinging \nbetween the voltage levels dictated by the power topology, requiring the charging/discharging of the drain-gate \ncapacitance with current supplied or removed by the driver device [ 1].\nTwo circuits are used to test the current capabilities of the UCCx732x driver. In each case external circuitry \nis added to clamp the output near 5 V while the IC is sinking or sourcing current. An input pulse of 250 \nns is applied at a frequency of 1 kHz in the proper polarity for the respective test. In each test there is a \ntransient period where the current peaked up and then settled down to a steady-state value. The noted current \nmeasurements are made at a time of 200 ns after the input pulse is applied, after the initial transient. [ 1]\nThe first circuit in Figure 8-2  is used to verify the current sink capability when the output of the driver is clamped \naround 5 V, a typical value of gate-source voltage during the Miller plateau region. The UCCx7323 is found to \nsink 4.5 A at VDD = 15 V and 4.28 A at VDD = 12 V.UCC27323, UCC27324, UCC27325, UCC37323, UCC37324, UCC37325\nSLUS492K – JUNE 2001 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2023\n www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC27323  UCC27324  UCC27325  UCC37323  UCC37324  UCC37325\nUCCx 7323\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5N/C N/C\nINA\nINBGNDOUTA\nOUTBVDD\n1 µF CER\n100 µF\nAL EL1µF CER 100µF\nAL ELVADJ\n5.5V10 Ω\nRSNS\n0.1 ΩVSNSSignal\nGenerator\nproducing\n250 ns wide\npulseDSCHOTTKYVDD\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFigure 8-2.

Parallel Operation of UCCx7323 and UCCx7324\nImportant consideration about paralleling two channels for UCCx7323/4 include: 1) INA and INB should be \nshorted in PCB layout as close to the device as possible, as well as for OUTA and OUTB, in which condition \nPCB layout parasitic mismatching between two channels could be minimized. 2) INA/B input slope signal should \nbe fast enough to avoid mismatched V IN_H/VIN_L, td1/td2 between channel-A and channel-B. TI recommends \nhaving input signal slope faster than 20 V/us.\n8.2.2.3 VDD\nAlthough quiescent VDD current is very low, total supply current will be higher, depending on OUTA and OUTB \ncurrent and the programmed oscillator frequency. Total VDD current is the sum of quiescent VDD current and \nthe average OUT current. Knowing the operating frequency and the MOSFET gate charge (Q g), average OUT \ncurrent can be calculated using Equation 1 .\nIOUT = Q g × f (1)\nwhere\n•f is frequency\nFor the best high-speed circuit performance, two VDD bypass capacitors are recommended to prevent noise \nproblems. The use of surface mount components is highly recommended. A 0.1-µF ceramic capacitor should be \nlocated closest to the VDD to ground connection. In addition, a larger capacitor (such as 1 µF and above) with \nrelatively low ESR should be connected in parallel, to help deliver the high current peaks to the load. The parallel \ncombination of capacitors should present a low impedance characteristic for the expected current levels in the \ndriver application.\n8.2.2.4 Driver Current and Power Requirements\nThe UCCx732x family of drivers is capable of delivering 4 A of current to a MOSFET gate for a period of tens \nof nanoseconds. High peak current is required to turn the device ON quickly. Then, to turn the device OFF, the \ndriver is required to sink a similar amount of current to ground. This repeats at the operating frequency of the \npower device. A MOSFET is used in this discussion because it is the most common type of switching device \nused in high-frequency power conversion equipment.\nReference [ 1] and reference [ 2] discuss the current required to drive a power MOSFET and other capacitive-\ninput switching devices. Reference [ 2] includes information on the previous generation of bipolar IC gate drivers.UCC27323, UCC27324, UCC27325, UCC37323, UCC37324, UCC37325\nSLUS492K – JUNE 2001 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2023\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC27323  UCC27324  UCC27325  UCC37323  UCC37324  UCC37325\nWhen a driver IC is tested with a discrete, capacitive load, it is a fairly simple matter to calculate the power that is \nrequired from the bias supply. The energy that must be transferred from the bias supply to charge the capacitor \nis given by Equation 2 .\nE = ½CV2(2)\nwhere\n•C is the load capacitor\n•V is the bias voltage feeding the driver\nThere is an equal amount of energy transferred to ground when the capacitor is discharged. This leads to a \npower loss given by Equation 3 .\nP = CV2 × f (3)\nwhere\n•f is the switching frequency\nThis power is dissipated in the resistive elements of the circuit. Thus, with no external resistor between the \ndriver and gate, this power is dissipated inside the driver. Half of the total power is dissipated when the capacitor \nis charged, and the other half is dissipated when the capacitor is discharged. An actual example using the \nconditions of the previous gate drive waveform should help clarify this.\nWith V DD = 12 V, C LOAD = 10 nF, and f = 300 kHz, the power loss can be calculated as Equation 4 .\nP = 10 nF × (12 V)2 × (300 kHz) = 0.432 W (4)\nWith a 12-V supply, this equates to a current of (see Equation 5 ):\nI = P/V = 0.432 W /12 V = 36 mA (5)\nThe actual current measured from the supply was 0.037 A, and is very close to the predicted value. But, the \nIDD current that is due to the IC internal consumption should be considered. With no load the IC current draw \nis 0.0027 A. Under this condition the output rise and fall times are faster than with a load. This could lead \nto an almost insignificant, yet measurable current due to cross-conduction in the output stages of the driver. \nHowever, these small current differences are buried in the high frequency switching spikes, and are beyond the \nmeasurement capabilities of a basic lab setup. The measured current with 10-nF load is reasonably close to that \nexpected.\nThe switching load presented by a power MOSFET can be converted to an equivalent capacitance by examining \nthe gate charge required to switch the device. This gate charge includes the effects of the input capacitance plus \nthe added charge needed to swing the drain of the device between the ON and OFF states. Most manufacturers \nprovide specifications that provide the typical and maximum gate charge, in nC, to switch the device under \nspecified conditions. Using the gate charge Q g, one can determine the power that must be dissipated when \ncharging a capacitor. This is done by using the equivalence Q g = C eff × V to provide Equation 6  for power:\nP = C × V2 × f = V × Q g × f (6)\nEquation 6  allows a power designer to calculate the bias power required to drive a specific MOSFET gate at a \nspecific bias voltage and a specific switching frequency.\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 8-5  shows the circuit performance achievable with a single driver (half of the 8-pin IC) driving a 10-nF \nload. The input pulse width (not shown) is set to 300 ns to show both transitions in the output waveform. \nNote the linear rise and fall edges of the switching waveforms which is due to the constant output current \nwww.ti.comUCC27323, UCC27324, UCC27325, UCC37323, UCC37324, UCC37325\nSLUS492K – JUNE 2001 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: UCC27323  UCC27324  UCC27325  UCC37323  UCC37324  UCC37325\ncharacteristic of the driver as opposed to the resistive output impedance of traditional MOSFET-based gate \ndrivers.\nSink and source currents of the driver are dependent upon the VDD value and the output capacitive load. The \nlarger the VDD value, the higher the current capability; also, the larger the capacitive load, the higher the current \nsink and source capability.\nTrace resistance and inductance, including wires and cables for testing, slows down the rise and fall times of the \noutputs; thus reducing the current capabilities of the driver.\nTo achieve higher current results, reduce resistance and inductance on the board as much as possible and \nincrease the capacitive load value in order to swamp out the effect of inductance values.\nCL = 10 nF, C L = 10 nF, VDD = 12 V\nFigure 8-5. Rising and Falling Time of UCCx732x\n9 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe recommended bias supply voltage range for UCCx732x is from 4.5 V to 15 V. The upper end of this range is \ndriven by the 16 V absolute maximum voltage rating of the VDD. TI recommends keeping proper margin to allow \nfor transient voltage spikes.\nA local bypass capacitor must be placed between the VDD and GND pins. And this capacitor must be placed as \nclose to the device as possible. A low ESR, ceramic surface mount capacitor is recommended. TI recommends \nusing 2 capacitors across VDD and GND: a 100-nF ceramic surface-mount capacitor for high frequency filtering \nplaced very close to VDD and GND pin, and another surface-mount capacitor, 220 nF to\n10 µF, for IC bias requirements.UCC27323, UCC27324, UCC27325, UCC37323, UCC37324, UCC37325\nSLUS492K – JUNE 2001 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2023\n www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC27323  UCC27324  UCC27325  UCC37323  UCC37324  UCC37325\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nOptimum performance of high and low-side gate drivers cannot be achieved without taking due considerations \nduring circuit board layout. The following points are emphasized:\n1) Low ESR/ESL capacitors must be connected close to the IC between VDD and GND pins to support high \npeak currents drawn from VDD during the turn-on of the external MOSFETs.\n2) Grounding considerations:\n•The first priority in designing grounding connections is to confine the high peak currents that charge and \ndischarge the MOSFET gates to a minimal physical area. This will decrease the loop inductance and \nminimize noise issues on the gate terminals of the MOSFETs. The gate driver must be placed as close \nas possible to the MOSFETs.\n•Star-point grounding is a good way to minimize noise coupling from one current loop to another. The GND \nof the driver is connected to the other circuit nodes such as source of power MOSFET and ground of PWM \ncontroller at one, single point. The connected paths must be as short as possible to reduce inductance and \nbe as wide as possible to reduce resistance.\n•Use a ground plane to provide noise shielding. Fast rise and fall times at OUT may corrupt the input signals \nduring transition. The ground plane must not be a conduction path for any current loop. Instead the ground \nplane must be connected to the star-point with one single trace to establish the ground potential. In addition \nto noise shielding, the ground plane can help in power dissipation as well.\n3) In noisy environments, tying inputs of an unused channel of the UCC2742x device to VDD or GND using short \ntraces in order to ensure that the output is enabled and to prevent noise from causing malfunction in the output \nmay be necessary.\n4) Separate power traces and signal traces, such as output and input signals.\n10.2 Layout Example\nUCCx732x\nINA\nGND\nINBOUTA\nVDD\nOUTBGround plane \n(Bottom Layer)\nBypassing Cap, 0.1 \x1dFExt.

In order for a power driver to be useful over a particular temperature range, \nthe package must allow for the efficient removal of the heat produced while keeping the junction temperature \nwithin rated limits. The UCCx732x family of drivers is available in three different packages to cover a range of \napplication requirements.\nThe MSOP PowerPAD-8 (DGN) package significantly relieves this concern by offering an effective means of \nremoving the heat from the semiconductor junction. As illustrated in reference [ 3], the PowerPAD packages offer \na lead-frame die pad that is exposed at the base of the package. This pad is soldered to the copper on the PC \nboard directly underneath the IC package, reducing the θJC down to 4.7°C/W. Data is presented in reference \n[3] to show that the power dissipation can be quadrupled in the PowerPAD configuration when compared to \nthe standard packages. The PC board must be designed with thermal lands and thermal vias to complete the \nheat removal subsystem, as summarized in reference [ 4]. This design allows a significant improvement in heat \nsinking over that which is available in the D or P packages, and is shown to more than double the power \ncapability of the D and P packages.\nNote\nThe PowerPAD is not directly connected to any leads of the package. However, the PowerPad is \nelectrically and thermally connected to the substrate which is the ground of the device.UCC27323, UCC27324, UCC27325, UCC37323, UCC37324, UCC37325\nSLUS492K – JUNE 2001 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2023\n www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: UCC27323  UCC27324  UCC27325  UCC37323  UCC37324  UCC37325\n11 Device and Documentation Support\n11.1 Device Support\n11.1.1 Third-Party Products Disclaimer\nTI\'S PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DOES NOT \nCONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES \nOR A WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, EITHER \nALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY TI PRODUCT OR SERVICE.\n11.2 Documentation Support\n11.2.1 Related Documentation\nSee the following for related documentation:\n1.Power Supply Seminar SEM-1400 Topic 2, Design And Application Guide For High Speed MOSFET Gate \nDrive Circuits  (SLUP133)\n2.Practical Considerations in High Performance MOSFET, IGBT and MCT Gate Drive Circuits  (SLUA105)\n3.PowerPad Thermally Enhanced Package  (SLMA002)\n4.PowerPAD Made Easy  (SLMA004)\n11.3 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
