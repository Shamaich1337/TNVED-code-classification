The FM 1105  simplifies the \ndesign of system control functions. This product is \nunique because it  remember s the stored output \nvalues in the absence of power. Any change in the \nlatched state is automatically wri tten to a nonvolatile \nferroelectric latch. This function is possible due to \nthe fast write time and extremely high write \nendurance of the underlying ferroelectric memory \ntechnology.   \n Use of Enable Pin  \nThe FM 1105  has an enable pin that is intended to be  \nused in conjunction with a system reset.  An active -\nlow reset may be tied directly to the EN pin.  At \npower -up, /RESET will be held low for some time \nduring which the data input and CLK pins will be \nignored.  Once the system comes out of reset and EN \ngoes high, the outputs Q N drive to the state that were \npreviously latched and the device operates normally.  \nWhen the EN pin is low, the outputs Q N are tri -\nstated.  \n \nThe enable pin may be tied to V DD since the device \nintegrates a power management circuit that mo nitors \nthe V DD level during power cycles.  \n \n \n \n \n \n FM1105 - Automotive Temp.  \n \nRev.4.0 \nOct. 2012 Page 4 of 8 Electrical Specifications  \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  \nSymbol  Description  Ratings  \nVDD Power Supply Voltage with respect to V SS -1.0V to +7 .0V \nVIN Voltage on any signal pin with respect to V SS -1.0V to +7 .0V \nand V IN < V DD+1.0V  \nTSTG Storage temperature  -55\uf0b0C to + 125 \uf0b0C \nTLEAD Lead temperature (Soldering, 10 seconds)  300\uf0b0 C \nVESD Electrostatic Discharge Voltage  \n - Human Body Model  (JEDE C Std JESD22 -A114 -B) \n - Charged Device Model  (JEDE C Std JESD22 -C101 -A) \n - Machine Model  (JEDEC Std JESD22 -A115 -A)  \n4kV \n1kV \n200V  \n Package Moisture Sensitivity Level  MSL -1 \nStresses above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings may cause permanent damage to the device.
