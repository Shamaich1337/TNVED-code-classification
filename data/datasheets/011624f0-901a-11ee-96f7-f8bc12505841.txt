GENERAL  DESCRIPTION\nMX25L51245G is 512Mb bits Serial NOR Flash memory, which is configured as 67,108,864 x 8 internally. When it is \nin two or four I/O mode, the structure becomes 268,435,456 bits x 2 or 134,217,728 bits x 4. MX25L51245G feature a serial peripheral interface and software protocol allowing operation on a simple 3-wire bus while it is in single I/O mode. The three bus signals are a clock input (SCLK), a serial data input (SI), and a serial data output (SO). Serial  \naccess to the device is enabled by CS# input.\nWhen it is in two I/O read mode, the SI pin and SO pin become SIO0 pin and SIO1 pin for address/dummy bits \ninput and data output. When it is in four I/O read mode, the SI pin, SO pin, WP# and RESET# pin (of the 8-pin package) or and NC pin become SIO0 pin, SIO1 pin, SIO2 pin and SIO3 pin for address/dummy bits input and data output.\nThe MX25L51245G \nMXSMIO\uf6da (Serial Multi I/O) provides sequential read operation on the whole chip.\nAfter program/erase command is issued, auto program/erase algorithms which program/erase and verify the \nspecified page or sector/block locations will be executed. Program command is executed on byte basis, or page (256 bytes) basis, or word basis for  erase command is executed on 4K-byte sector, 32K-byte block, or 64K-byte block, or whole chip basis.\nTo provide user with ease of interface, a status register is included to indicate the status of the chip. The status read \ncommand can be issued to detect completion status of a program or erase operation via WIP bit.\nAdvanced security features enhance the protection and security functions, please refer to the security features \nsection for more details.\nWhen the device is not in operation and CS# is high, it will remain in standby mode.The MX25L51245G utilizes Macronix\'s proprietary memory cell, which reliably stores memory contents even after \n100,000 program and erase cycles.\nTable 1.

DATA PROTECTION\nDuring power transition, there may be some false system level signals which result in inadvertent erasure or \nprogramming. The device is designed to protect itself from these accidental write cycles.\nThe state machine will be reset as standby mode automatically during power up. In addition, the control register \narchitecture of the device constrains that the memory contents can only be changed after specific command sequences have completed successfully. \nIn the following, there are several features to protect the system from the accidental write cycles during VCC power-\nup and power-down or from system noise.\n•   V alid command length checking: The command length will be checked whether it is at byte base and completed \non byte boundary.\n•   W rite Enable (WREN) command: WREN command is required to set the Write Enable Latch bit (WEL) before \nother commands to change data. \n•   Deep Power Down Mode: By entering deep power down mode, the flash device also is under protected from \nwriting all commands except Release from deep power down mode command (RDP) and Read Electronic Signature command (RES), Erase/Program suspend command, Erase/Program resume command and softreset command.\n•   Advanced Security Features: there are some protection and security features which protect content from \ninadvertent write and hostile access.\n \n10\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix Proprietary  I. Block lock protection\n -  The Software Protected Mode (SPM) use (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 and T/B) bits to allow part of memory to be \nprotected as read only. The protected area definition is shown as Table 2  Protected Area Sizes, the protected \nareas are more flexible which may protect various area by setting value of BP0-BP3 bits.\n - The Hardware Protected Mode (HPM) use WP#/SIO2 to protect the (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits and Status \nRegister Write Protect bit. \n - In f our I/O and QPI mode, the feature of HPM will be disabled. \nTable 2.

DEVICE OPERATION\n1. Before a command is issued, status register should be checked to ensure device is ready for the intended \noperation.\n2. When an incorrect command is written to this device, it enters standby mode and stays in standby mode until the \nnext CS# falling edge. In standby mode, This device\'s SO pin should be High-Z.\n3. When a correct command  is written to this device, it enters active mode and stays in active mode until the next \nCS# rising edge.\n4. Input data is latched on the rising edge of Serial Clock (SCLK) and data shifts out on the falling edge of SCLK. \nThe difference of Serial  mode 0 and mode 3 is shown as  "Serial Modes Supported".\n5. For the following instructio ns: RDID, RDSR, RDSCUR, READ/READ4B, FAST_READ/FAST_READ4B, \n2READ/2READ4B, DREAD/DREAD4B, 4READ/4READ4B, QREAD/QREAD4B, RDSFDP, RES, REMS, QPIID, \nRDDPB, RDSPB, RDPASS, RDLR, RDEAR, RDFBR, RDSPBLK, RDCR, the shifted-in instruction sequence is followed by a data-out sequence. After any bit of data being shifted out, the CS# can be high. For the following instructions: WREN, WRDI, WRSR, SE/SE4B, BE32K/BE32K4B, BE/BE4B, CE, PP/PP4B, 4PP/4PP4B, DP, ENSO, EXSO, WRSCUR, EN4B, EX4B, WPSEL, GBLK, GBULK, SPBLK, SUSPEND, RESUME, NOP, RSTEN, RST, EQIO, RSTQIO the CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary; otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and not executed.\n6. While a W rite Status Register, Program, or Erase operation is in progress, access to the memory array is \nignored and will not affect the current operation of Write Status Register, Program, or Erase. \nFigure 1. Serial Modes Supported\nNote:CPOL indicates clock polarity of Serial master, CPOL=1 for SCLK high while idle, CPOL=0 for SCLK low while not transmitting. CPHA indicates clock phase.

For the \nmemory device of 256Mb and above, the 32bit address is requested for access higher memory size. The MX25L51245G provides three different methods to access the whole density:\n(1) Command entry 4-byte address mode: \nIssue Enter 4-Byte mode command to set up the 4BYTE bit in Configuration Register bit. After 4BYTE bit has \nbeen set, the number of address cycle become 32-bit. \n(2) Extended Address Register (EAR): configure the memory device into four 128Mb segments to select which one is active through the EAR<0-1>.\n(3) 4-byte Address Command Set: When issuing 4-byte address command set, 4-byte address (A31-A0) is requested after the instruction code. \nPlease note that it is not necessary to issue EN4B command before issuing any of 4-byte command set.\nExtended Address Register \nThe device provides an 8-bit volatile register for extended Address Register: it identifies the extended address (A31~A24) \nabove 128Mb density by using original 3-byte address.\nExtended Address Register (EAR)\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\nA31 A30 A29 A28 A27 A26 A25 A24\nFor the MX25L51245G the A31 to A26 are Don\'t Care. During EAR, reading these bits will read as 0. The bit 0 is default as "0".Enter 4-Byte Address Mode\nIn 4-byte Address mode, all instructions are 32-bits address clock cycles. By using EN4B and EX4B to enable and \ndisable the 4-byte address mode.\nWhen 4-byte address mode is enabled, the EAR<0-1> becomes "don\'t care" for all instructions requiring 4-byte \naddress. The EAR function will be disabled when 4-byte mode is enabled.\n17\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryWhen under EAR mode, Read, Program, Erase operates in the selected segment by using 3-byte address mode. \nFor the read operation, the whole array data can be continually read out with one command. Data output starts from \nthe selected top or bottom 128Mb, but it can cross the boundary.  When the last byte of the segment is reached, the next byte (in a continuous reading) is the first byte of the next segment. However, the EAR (Extended Address Register) value does not change. The random access reading can only be operated in the selected segment.\nThe Chip erase command will erase the whole chip and is not limited by EAR selected segment.  However, the \nsector erase, block erase, program operation are limited in selected segment and will not cross the boundary.\nFigure 6. Write EAR Register (WREAR) Sequence (SPI Mode)\nFigure 7.

Factory Mode Enable (FMEN)\nThe Factory Mode Enable (FMEN) instruction enhances Program and Erase performance to increase factory \nproduction throughput. The FMEN instruction needs to be combined with the instructions which are intended to change the device content, like PP/PP4B, 4PP/4PP4B, SE/SE4B, BE32K/BE32K4B, BE/BE4B, and CE.  \nThe sequence of issuing FMEN instruction is: CS# goes low→send FMEN instruction code→ CS# goes high. A valid \nfactory mode operation need to included three sequences: WREN instruction → FMEN instruction→ Program or Erase instruction.\nSuspend command is not acceptable under factory mode.The FMEN is reset by following situations\n - Power-up\n - Reset# pin driven low \n - PP/PP4B command completion\n - 4PP/4PP4B command completion\n - SE/SE4B command completion\n - BE32K/BE32K4B command completion\n - BE/BE4B command completion\n - CE command completion\n - Softreset command completion\nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) command cycle can be accepted by this instruction.

Release from Deep Power-down (RDP), Read Electronic Signature (RES)\nThe Release from Deep Power-down (RDP) instruction is completed by driving Chip Select (CS#) High. When Chip \nSelect (CS#) is driven High, the device is put in the Stand-by Power mode. If the device was not previously in the Deep Power-down mode, the transition to the Stand-by Power mode is immediate. If the device was previously in the Deep Power-down mode, though, the transition to the Stand-by Power mode is delayed by tRES1, and Chip Select (CS#) must remain High for at least tRES1(max), as specified in \nTable 25  AC Characteristics. Once in the \nStand-by Power mode, the device waits to be selected, so that it can receive, decode and execute instructions. The RDP instruction is only for releasing from Deep Power Down Mode. Reset# pin goes low will release the Flash from deep power down mode.\nRES instruction is for reading out the old style of 8-bit Electronic Signature, whose values are shown as \nTable 6  ID \nDefinitions.  This is not the same as RDID instruction. It is not recommended to use for new design. For new design, \nplease use RDID  instruction.  \nThe RDP and RES are allowed to execute in Deep power-down mode, except if the device is in progress of \nprogram/erase/write cycle; In this case, there is no effect on the current program/erase/write cycle that is in progress.\nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) command cycle can be accepted by this instruction. The SIO[3:1] are don\'t \ncare during SPI mode.  \nThe RES instruction ends when CS# goes high, after the ID been read out at least once. The ID outputs repeatedly \nif continuously send the additional clock cycles on SCLK while CS# is at low.  If the device was not previously in Deep Power-down mode, the device transition to standby mode is immediate.  If the device was previously in Deep Power-down mode, there\'s a delay of tRES2 to transit to standby mode, and CS# must remain to high at least tRES2(max).  Once in the standby mode, the device waits to be selected, so it can be receive, decode, and execute instruction.\nFigure 20.

Read Electronic Manufacturer ID & Device ID (REMS)\nThe REMS instruction returns both the JEDEC assigned manufacturer ID and the device ID. The Device ID values \nare listed in "Table 6. ID Definitions" .\nThe REMS instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and sending the instruction code "90h" followed by two dummy bytes and one address byte (A7~A0). After which the manufacturer ID for Macronix (C2h) and the device ID are shifted out on the falling edge of SCLK with the most significant bit (MSB) first. If the address byte is 00h, the manufacturer ID will be output first, followed by the device ID. If the address byte is 01h, then the device ID will be output first, followed by the manufacturer ID.  While CS# is low, the manufacturer and device IDs can be read continuously, alternating from one to the other. The instruction is completed by driving CS# high.\nNotes:(1) ADD=00H will output the manufacturer\'s ID first and ADD=01H will output device ID first.Figure 24.

The Write in Progress (WIP) bit, a volatile bit, indicates whether the device is busy in program/erase/write \nstatus register progress. When WIP bit sets to 1, which means the device is busy in program/erase/write status \nregister progress.  When WIP bit sets to 0, which means the device is not in progress of program/erase/write status register cycle.\nWEL bit. The Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit, a volatile bit, indicates whether the device is set to internal write enable \nlatch. When WEL bit sets to 1, which means the internal write enable latch is set, the device can accept program/\nerase/write status register instruction. When WEL bit sets to 0, which means no internal write enable latch; the device will not accept program/erase/write status register instruction. The program/erase command will be ignored \nif it is applied to a protected memory area. To ensure both WIP bit & WEL bit are both set to 0 and available for next \nprogram/erase/operations, WIP bit needs to be confirm to be 0 before polling WEL bit. After WIP bit confirmed, WEL \nbit needs to be confirm to be 0.\nBP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits.  The Block Protect (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits, non-volatile bits, indicate the protected area \n(as defined in Table 2 ) of the device to against the program/erase instruction without hardware protection mode being \nset. To write the Block Protect (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits requires the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction to \nbe executed. Those bits define the protected area of the memory to against Page Program (PP), Sector Erase (SE), \nBlock Erase 32KB (BE32K), Block Erase (BE) and Chip Erase (CE) instructions (only if Block Protect bits (BP3:BP0) \nset to 0, the CE instruction can be executed). The BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits are "0" as default. Which is un-protected.\nQE bit.  \nThe Quad Enable (QE) bit is a non-volatile bit with a factory default of “0”. When QE is “0”, Quad mode \ncommands are ignored; pins WP#/SIO2 and NC/SIO3 or RESET#/SIO3 (of the 8-pin package) function as WP# and \nNC or RESET#, respectively. When QE is “1”, Quad mode is enabled and Quad mode commands are supported along with Single and Dual mode commands. Pins WP#/SIO2 and NC/SIO3 or RESET#/SIO3 (of the 8-pin package) function as SIO2 and SIO3, respectively, and their alternate pin functions are disabled. Enabling Quad mode also disables the HPM and hardware RESET (of the 8-pin package) feature.\nSRWD bit. The Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit, non-volatile bit, is operated together with Write Protection \n(WP#/SIO2) pin for providing hardware protection mode. The hardware protection mode requires SRWD sets to 1 and \nWP#/SIO2 pin signal is low stage. In the hardware protection mode, the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction is \nno longer accepted for execution and the SRWD bit and Block Protect bits (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) are read only. The \nSRWD bit defaults to be "0". \n38\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryConfiguration Register\nThe Configuration Register is able to change the default status of Flash memory. Flash memory will be configured \nafter the CR bit is set. \nODS bit \nThe output driver strength (ODS2, ODS1, ODS0) bits are volatile bits, which indicate the output driver level (as \ndefined in "Table 9. Output Driver Strength Table" ) of the device. The Output Driver Strength is defaulted as 30 Ohms \nwhen delivered from factory. To write the ODS bits requires the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction to be executed.\nTB bit\nThe Top/Bottom (TB) bit is a non-volatile OTP bit. The Top/Bottom (TB) bit is used to configure the Block Protect \narea by BP bit (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0), starting from TOP or Bottom of the memory array. The TB bit is defaulted as “0”, which means Top area protect. When it is set as “1”, the protect area will change to Bottom area of the memory device.  To write the TB bits requires the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction to be executed.\nPBE bit\nThe Preamble Bit Enable (PBE) bit is a volatile bit. It is used to enable or disable the preamble bit data pattern \noutput on dummy cycles. The PBE bit is defaulted as “0”, which means preamble bit is disabled. When it is set as “1”, the preamble bit will be enabled, and inputted into dummy cycles. To write the PBE bits requires the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction to be executed.\n4BYTE Indicator bit\nBy writing EN4B instruction, the 4BYTE bit may be set as "1" to access the address length of 32-bit for memory area \nof higher density (large than 128Mb). The default state is "0" as the 24-bit address mode. The 4BYTE bit may be cleared by power-off or writing EX4B instruction to reset the state to be "0".\nTable 8.

Write Status Register (WRSR)\nThe WRSR instruction is for changing the values of Status Register Bits and Configuration Register Bits. Before \nsending WRSR instruction, the Write Enable (WREN) instruction must be decoded and executed to set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in advance. The WRSR instruction can change the value of Block Protect (BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits to define the protected area of memory (as shown in \nTable 2 ). The WRSR also can set or reset the Quad \nenable (QE) bit and set or reset the Status Register Write Disable (SRWD) bit in accordance with Write Protection (WP#/SIO2) pin signal, but has no effect on bit1(WEL) and bit0 (WIP) of the status register. The WRSR instruction cannot be executed once the Hardware Protected Mode (HPM) is entered.\nThe sequence of issuing WRSR instruction is: CS# goes low→ send WRSR instruction code→ Status Register data \non SI→Configuration Register data on SI→CS# goes high. \nThe CS# must go high exactly at the 8 bits or 16 bits data boundary; otherwise, the instruction will be rejected and \nnot executed. The self-timed Write Status Register cycle time (tW) is initiated as soon as Chip Select (CS#) goes high. The Write in Progress (WIP) bit still can be check out during the Write Status Register cycle is in progress.  The WIP sets 1 during the tW timing, and sets 0 when Write Status Register Cycle is completed, and the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset.\n41\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryTable 11.

The protected area, which is defined by BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 and T/B bit, is at software protected mode (SPM)\nNote: \nIf SRWD bit=1 but WP#/SIO2 is low, it is impossible to write the Status Register even if the WEL bit has previously \nbeen set.

The data of the protected area is protected by software protected mode by BP3, BP2, \nBP1, BP0 and T/B bit and hardware protected mode by the WP#/SIO2 to against data modification.\nNote: \nTo exit the hardware protected mode requires WP#/SIO2 driving high once the hardware protected mode is entered. \nIf the WP#/SIO2 pin is permanently connected to high, the hardware protected mode can never be entered; only can use software protected mode via BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 and T/B bit.If the system enter QPI or set QE=1, the feature of HPM will be disabled.\n42\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 33.

Enter 4-byte mode (EN4B)\nThe EN4B instruction enables accessing the address length of 32-bit for the memory area of higher density (larger \nthan 128Mb).  The device default is in 24-bit address mode; after sending out the EN4B instruction, the Bit5 (4BYTE bit) of Configuration Register will be automatically set to "1" to indicate the 4-byte address mode has been enabled. Once the 4-byte address mode is enabled, the address length becomes 32-bit instead of the default 24-bit.  There are three methods to exit the 4-byte mode: writing exit 4-byte mode (EX4B) instruction, Reset or power-off.  \nAll instructions are accepted normally, and just the address bit is changed from 24-bit to 32-bit.The following command don\'t support 4-byte address: RDSFDP, RES and REMS.The sequence of issuing EN4B instruction is: CS# goes low → send EN4B instruction to enter 4-byte mode( \nautomatically set 4BYTE bit as "1") → CS# goes high.\n9-12.  Exit 4-byte mode (EX4B)\nThe EX4B instruction is executed to exit the 4-byte address mode and return to the default 3-bytes address mode.  After sending out the EX4B instruction, the Bit5 (4BYTE bit) of Configuration Register will be cleared to be "0" to indicate the exit of the 4-byte address mode. Once exiting the 4-byte address mode, the address length will return to 24-bit. \nThe sequence of issuing EX4B instruction is: CS# goes low → send EX4B instruction to exit 4-byte mode (automatically \nclear the 4BYTE bit to be "0") → CS# goes high.\n45\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix Proprietary9-13.  Read Data Bytes (READ)\nThe read instruction is for reading data out. The address is latched on rising edge of SCLK, and data shifts out on \nthe falling edge of SCLK at a maximum frequency fR. The first address byte can be at any location. The address is automatically increased to the next higher address after each byte data is shifted out, so the whole memory can be read out at a single READ instruction. The address counter rolls over to 0 when the highest address has been reached.\nThe default read mode is 3-byte address, to access higher address (4-byte address) which requires to enter the \n4-byte address read mode or to define EAR bit.

Once the CR<4> is set, the preamble bit is inputted into dummy cycles. \nEnabling preamble bit will not affect the function of enhance mode bit. In Dummy cycles, performance enhance \nmode bit still operates with the same function. Preamble bit will output after performance enhance mode bit.\nThe preamble bit is a fixed 8-bit data pattern (00110100). While dummy cycle number reaches 10, the complete \n8 bits will start to output right after the performance enhance mode bit. While dummy cycle is not sufficient of 10 cycles, the rest of the preamble bits will be cut. For example, 8 dummy cycles will cause 6 preamble bits to output, and 6 dummy cycles will cause 4 preamble bits to output.\n57\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 48.

Performance Enhance Mode - XIP (execute-in-place)\nThe device could waive the command cycle bits if the two cycle bits after address cycle toggles. \nPerformance enhance mode is supported in both SPI and QPI mode.In QPI mode, “EBh” "ECh" "EDh" "EEh" and SPI “EBh” "ECh" "EDh" "EEh" commands support enhance mode. The \nperformance enhance mode is not supported in dual I/O mode.\nTo enter performance-enhancing mode, P[7:4] must be toggling with P[3:0]; likewise P[7:0]=A5h, 5Ah, F0h or 0Fh \ncan make this mode continue and skip the next 4READ instruction. To leave enhance mode, P[7:4] is no longer toggling with P[3:0]; likewise P[7:0]=FFh, 00h, AAh or 55h along with CS# is afterwards raised and then lowered. Issuing ”FFh” data cycle can also exit enhance mode. The system then will leave performance enhance mode and return to normal operation.\nTo conduct the Performance Enhance Mode Reset operation in SPI mode, FFh data cycle(8 clocks in 3-byte \naddress mode)/3FFh data cycle(10 clocks in 4-byte address mode), should be issued in 1I/O sequence. In QPI Mode, FFFFFFFFh data cycle(8 clocks in 3-byte address mode)/FFFFFFFFFFh data cycle (10 clocks in 4-byte address mode), in 4I/O should be issued. If the system controller is being Reset during operation, the flash device will return to the standard SPI operation.\nAfter entering enhance mode, following CS# go high, the device will stay in the read mode and treat CS# go low of \nthe first clock as address instead of command cycle.\nThis sequence of issuing 4READ instruction especially useful in random access: CS# goes low→send 4READ\ninstruction→3-bytes or 4-bytes address interleave on SIO3, SIO2, SIO1 & SIO0→performance enhance toggling bit P[7:0]→ 4 dummy cycles (Default) →data out until CS# goes high → CS# goes low (The following 4READ instruction is not allowed, hence 8 cycles of 4READ can be saved comparing to normal 4READ mode) → 3-bytes or 4-bytes random access address.\n68\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 69. 4 x I/O Read Performance Enhance Mode Sequence (SPI Mode) \n2 1345678 0\nSCLK\nSIO0\nSIO1CS#\n9 12 10 11 13 14\nEBh15 16\nn+1 ........... ...... ........... ........... n+7 n+9 n+1317 18 19 20 21 22 n\nSIO2\nSIO3\nSIO0\nSIO1\nSIO2SIO3Performance\nenhance \nindicator (Note 1)\nSCLKCS#\nPerformance\nenhance \nindicator (Note 1)Mode 3\nMode 0\nA21 A17 A13 A9 A5 A1A8 A4 A\x11 A20 A16 A12\nA23 A19 A15 A11 A7 A3A10 A6 A2 A22 A18 A14P4 P0\nP5 P1\nP6 P2\nP7 P3\nA21 A17 A13 A9 A5 A1A8 A4 A\x11 A20 A16 A12\nA23 A19 A15 A11 A7 A3A10 A6 A2 A22 A18 A14P4 P0\nP5 P1\nP6 P2\nP7 P3Command\nConfigurable \nDummy Cycle (Note 2)6 ADD Cycles\n(Note 3)\n6 ADD Cycles\n(Note 3)D4 D0\nD5 D1Data \nOut 1Data \nOut 2Data \nOut n\nD4 D0\nD5 D1D4 D0\nD5 D1\nD6 D2\nD7 D3D6 D2\nD7 D3D6 D2\nD7 D3\nD4 D0\nD5 D1Data \nOut 1Data \nOut 2Data \nOut n\nD4 D0\nD5 D1D4 D0\nD5 D1\nD6 D2\nD7 D3D6 D2\nD7 D3D6 D2\nD7 D3Mode 3\nMode 0\nConfigurable \nDummy Cycle (Note 2)\nNotes: \n1.

Burst Read\nThe Burst Read feature allows applications to fill a cache line with a fixed length of data without using multiple readcommands. Burst Read is disabled by default at power-up or reset. Burst Read is enabled by setting the Burst Length. When the Burst Length is set, reads will wrap on the selected boundary (8/16/32/64-bytes) containing the initial target address. For example if an 8-byte Wrap Depth is selected, reads will wrap on the 8-byte-page-aligned boundary containing the initial read address.\nTo set the Burst Length, drive CS# low → send SET BURST LENGTH instruction code (C0h) → send WRAP CODE \n→ drive CS# high. Refer to the table below for valid 8-bit Wrap Codes and their corresponding Wrap Depth.\n73\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryTable 12. Fast Boot Register (FBR)9-26.  Fast Boot\nThe Fast Boot Feature provides the ability to automatically execute read operation after power on cycle or reset \nwithout any read instruction. \nA Fast Boot Register is provided on this device. It can enable the Fast Boot function and also define the number of \ndelay cycles and start address (where boot code being transferred). Instruction WRFBR (write fast boot register) and ESFBR (erase fast boot register) can be used for the status configuration or alternation of the Fast Boot Register bit. RDFBR (read fast boot register) can be used to verify the program state of the Fast Boot Register. The default number of delay cycles is 13 cycles, and there is a 16bytes boundary address for the start of boot code access. \nWhen CS# starts to go low, data begins to output from default address after the delay cycles (default as 13 cycles). \nAfter CS# returns to go high, the device will go back to standard SPI mode and user can start to input command. In the fast boot data out process from CS# goes low to CS# goes high, a minimum of one byte must be output. \nOnce Fast Boot feature has been enabled, the device will automatically start a read operation after power on cycle, \nreset command, or hardware reset operation.\nThe fast Boot feature can support Single I/O and Quad I/O interface. If the QE bit of Status Register is “0”, the data \nis output by Single I/O interface. If the QE bit of Status Register is set to “1”, the data is output by Quad I/O interface.\nBits Description Bit Status Default State Type \n31 to 4 FBSA (FastBoot Start \nAddress)16 bytes boundary address for the start of boot code access.FFFFFFFNon-\nVolatile \n3 x 1Non-\nVolatile\n2 to 1FBSD (FastBoot Start \nDelay Cycle)00: 7 delay cycles01: 9 delay cycles10: 11 delay cycles11: 13 delay cycles11Non-\nVolatile\n0 FBE (FastBoot Enable)0=FastBoot is enabled.1=FastBoot is not enabled.1Non-\nVolatile\nNote: If FBSD = 11, the maximum clock frequency is 133 MHz         If FBSD = 10, the maximum clock frequency is 104 MHz         If FBSD = 01, the maximum clock frequency is 84 MHz         If FBSD = 00, the maximum clock frequency is 70 MHz\n74\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 75.

Please note that it does not interrupt or stop any operation in the flash memory .\nErase Suspend bit. Erase Suspend Bit (ESB) indicates the status of Erase Suspend operation. Users may use \nESB to identify the state of flash memory. After the flash memory is suspended by Erase Suspend command, ESB is set to "1".  ESB is cleared to "0" after erase operation resumes.\nProgram Suspend bit. Program Suspend Bit (PSB) indicates the status of Program Suspend operation. Users may \nuse PSB to identify the state of flash memory. After the flash memory is suspended by Program Suspend command, \nPSB is set to "1".  PSB is cleared to "0" after program operation resumes.\nSecured OTP Indicator bit. The Secured OTP indicator bit shows the secured OTP area is locked by factory or \nnot. When it is "0", it indicates non-factory lock; "1" indicates factory-lock.Lock-down Secured OTP (LDSO) bit. By writing WRSCUR instruction, the LDSO bit may be set to "1" for \ncustomer lock-down purpose. However, once the bit is set to "1" (lock-down), the LDSO bit and the 4K-bit Secured \nOTP area cannot be updated any more. \n88\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix Proprietary9-38.  Write Protection Selection (WPSEL)\nThere are two write protection methods provided on this device, (1) Block Protection (BP) mode or (2) Advanced \nSector Protection mode. The protection modes are mutually exclusive. The WPSEL bit selects which protection mode is enabled. If WPSEL=0 (factory default), BP mode is enabled and Advanced Sector Protection mode is disabled. If WPSEL=1, Advanced Sector Protection mode is enabled and BP mode is disabled. The WPSEL command is used to set WPSEL=1. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the WPSEL command. Please note that the WPSEL bit is an OTP bit. Once WPSEL is set to “1”, it cannot be \nprogrammed back to “0”. \nWhen WPSEL = 0: Block Protection (BP) mode, \nThe memory array is write protected by the BP3-BP0 bits.\nWhen WPSEL =1: Advanced Sector Protection mode ,\nBlocks are individually protected by their own SPB or DPB. On power-up, all blocks are write protected by the \nDynamic Protection Bits (DPB) by default. The Advanced Sector Protection instructions WRLR, RDLR, WRPASS, RDPASS, PASSULK, WRSPB, ESSPB, SPBLK, RDSPBLK, WRDPB, RDDPB, GBLK, and GBULK  are activated. The BP3~BP0 bits of the Status Register are disabled and have no effect. Hardware protection is performed by driving WP#=0. Once WP#=0 all blocks and sectors are write protected regardless of the state of each SPB or DPB.\nThe sequence of issuing WPSEL instruction is: CS# goes low → send WPSEL instruction to enable the Advanced \nSector Protect mode → CS# goes high.\nWrite Protection Selection \nStart\n(Default in BP Mode)\nSet\nWPSEL BitWPSEL=0 WPSEL=1\nBit 2 =0Bit 1 =0Block Protection\n(BP)Advance \nSector Protection\nSet\nLock Register\nPassword \nProtectionSolid \nProtectionDynamic\nProtection\n89\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 97.

Advanced Sector Protection\nAdvanced Sector Protection can protect individual 4KB sectors in the bottom and top 64KB of memory and protect \nindividual 64KB blocks in the rest of memory. \nThere is one non-volatile Solid Protection Bit (SPB) and one volatile Dynamic Protection Bit (DPB) assigned to each \n4KB sector at the bottom and top 64KB of memory and to each 64KB block in the rest of memory. A sector or block is write-protected from programming or erasing when its associated SPB or DPB is set to “1”. Please refer to \n"9-39-\n6. Sector Protection States Summary Table"  for the sector state with the protection status of DPB/SPB bits.\nThere are two mutually exclusive implementations of Advanced Sector Protection: Solid Protection mode (factory default) and Password Protection mode. Solid Protection mode permits the SPB bits to be modified after power-on or a reset. The Password Protection mode requires a valid password before allowing the SPB bits to be modified. The figure below is an overview of Advanced Sector Protection. \nFigure 98.

Lock Register\nThe Lock Register is a 16-bit one-time programmable register. Lock Register bits [2:1] select between Solid \nProtection mode and Password Protection mode. When both bits are “1” (factory default), Solid Protection mode is enabled by default. The Lock Register is programmed using the WRLR (Write Lock Register) command. Programming Lock Register bit 1 to “0” permanently selects Solid Protection mode and permanently disables Password Protection mode. Conversely, programming bit 2 to “0” permanently selects Password Protection mode and permanently disables Solid Protection mode. Bits 1 and 2 cannot be programmed to “0” at the same time otherwise the device will abort the operation. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the WRLR command.\nA password must be set prior to selecting Password Protection mode. The password can be set by issuing the \nWRPASS command.\nLock Register\nBit 15-3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit0\nReserved Password Protection Mode Lock Bit Solid Protection Mode Lock Bit Reserved\nx0=Password Protection Mode Enable                   \n1= Password Protection Mode not \nenable (Default =1)0=Solid Protection Mode Enable                                     \n1= Solid Protection Mode not enable (Default =1)x\nOTP OTP OTP OTP\nFigure 99.

SPB Lock Bit (SPBLK)\nThe SPB Lock Bit (SPBLK) is a volatile bit located in bit 0 of the SPB Lock Register. The SPBLK bit controls whether \nthe SPB bits can be modified or not. If SPBLK=1, the SPB bits are unprotected and can be modified. If SPBLK=0, the SPB bits are protected (“locked”) and cannot be modified. The power-on and reset status of the SPBLK bit is determined by Lock Register bits [2:1]. Refer to \n"Table 14. SPB Lock Register"  for SPBLK bit default power-on status. \nThe RDSPBLK command can be used to read the SPB Lock Register to determine the state of the SPBLK bit.\nIn Solid Protection mode, the SPBLK bit defaults to “1” after power-on or reset. When SPBLK=1, the SPB bits are \nunprotected (“unlocked”) and can be modified. The SPB Lock Bit Set command can be used to write the SPBLK bit to “0” and protect the SPB bits. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the SPB Lock Bit Set command. Once the SPBLK has been written to “0”, there is no command to set the bit back to “1”. A power-oncycle or hardware reset is required to set the SPB lock bit back to “1”.\nIn Password Protection mode, the SPBLK bit defaults to “0” after power-on or reset. A valid password must \nbe provided to set the SPBLK bit to “1” to allow the SPBs to be modified. After the SPBs have been set to the desired status, use the SPB Lock Bit Set command to clear the SPBLK bit back to “0” in order to prevent further modification.\nTable 14.

Solid Protection Bits\nThe Solid Protection Bits (SPBs) are nonvolatile bits for enabling or disabling write-protection to sectors and blocks. \nThe SPB bits have the same endurance as the Flash memory. An SPB is assigned to each 4KB sector in the bottom and top 64KB of memory and to each 64KB block in the remaining memory. The factory default state of the SPB bits is “0”, which has the sector/block write-protection disabled.\nWhen an SPB is set to “1”, the associated sector or block is write-protected. Program and erase operations on the \nsector or block will be inhibited. SPBs can be individually set to “1” by the WRSPB command. However, the SPBs cannot be individually cleared to “0”. Issuing the ESSPB command clears all SPBs to “0”. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the WRSPB or ESSPB command.\nThe SPBLK bit must be “1” before any SPB can be modified. In Solid Protection mode the SPBLK bit  defaults to “1” \nafter power-on or reset. Under Password Protection mode, the SPBLK bit defaults to “0” after power-on or reset, and a PASSULK command with a correct password is required to set the SPBLK bit to “1”.\nThe SPB Lock Bit Set command clears the SPBLK bit to “0”, locking the SPB bits from further modification.The RDSPB command reads the status of the SPB of a sector or block.  The RDSPB command returns 00h if the \nSPB is “0”, indicating write-protection is disabled. The RDSPB command returns FFh if the SPB is “1”, indicating write-protection is enabled.\nNote:  If SPBLK=0, commands to set or clear the SPB bits will be ignored.\nTable 15.

Dynamic Protection Bits\nThe Dynamic Protection Bits (DPBs) are volatile bits for quickly and easily enabling or disabling write-protection \nto sectors and blocks. A DPB is assigned to each 4KB sector in the bottom and top 64KB of memory and to each 64KB block in the rest of the memory. The DBPs can enable write-protection on a sector or block regardless of the state of the corresponding SPB. However, the DPB bits can only unprotect sectors or blocks whose SPB bits are “0” (unprotected).\nWhen a DPB is “1”, the associated sector or block will be write-protected, preventing any program or erase \noperation on the sector or block. All DPBs default to “1” after power-on or reset. When a DPB is cleared to “0”, the associated sector or block will be unprotected if the corresponding SPB is also “0”.  \nDPB bits can be individually set to “1” or “0” by the WRDPB command. The DBP bits can also be globally cleared to \n“0” with the GBULK command or globally set to “1” with the GBLK command. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the WRDPB, GBULK, or GBLK command.\nThe RDDPB command reads the status of the DPB of a sector or block. The RDDPB command returns 00h if the \nDPB is “0”, indicating write-protection is disabled. The RDDPB command returns FFh if the DPB is “1”, indicating write-protection is enabled.\nDPB Register \nFigure 106.

Password Protection Mode\nPassword Protection mode potentially provides a higher level of security than Solid Protection mode. In Password \nProtection mode, the SPBLK bit defaults to “0” after a power-on cycle or reset. When SPBLK=0, the SPBs are locked and cannot be modified. A 64-bit password must be provided to unlock the SPBs.\nThe PASSULK command with the correct password will set the SPBLK bit to “1” and unlock the SPB bits. After the \ncorrect password is given, a wait of 2us is necessary for the SPB bits to unlock. The Status Register WIP bit will clear to “0” upon completion of the PASSULK command. Once unlocked, the SPB bits can be modified. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the PASSULK command. \nSeveral steps are required to place the device in Password Protection mode. Prior to entering the Password \nProtection mode, it is necessary to set the 64-bit password and verify it. The WRPASS command writes the password and the RDPASS command reads back the password. Password verification is permitted until the Password Protection Mode Lock Bit has been written to “0”. Password Protection mode is activated by programming the Password Protection Mode Lock Bit to “0”. This operation is not reversible. Once the bit is programmed, it cannot be erased. The device remains permanently in Password Protection mode and the 64-bit password can neither be retrieved nor reprogrammed..\nThe password is all “1’s” when shipped from the factory. The WRPASS command can only program password bits to “0”. \nThe WRPASS command cannot program “0’s” back to “1’s”. All 64-bit password combinations are valid password options. A WREN command must be executed to set the WEL bit before sending the WRPASS command.\n●  The unlock operation will fail if the password provided by the PASSULK command does not match the stored \npassword. This will set the P_FAIL bit to “1” and insert a 100us ± 20us delay before clearing the WIP bit to “0”. \n●  The PASSULK command is prohibited from being executed faster than once every 100us ± 20us. This restriction \nmakes it impractical to attempt all combinations of a 64-bit password (such an effort would take ~58 million \nyears). Monitor the WIP bit to determine whether the device has completed the PASSULK command.\n●  When a valid password is provided, the PASSULK command does not insert the 100us delay before returning \nthe WIP bit to zero. The SPBLK bit will set to “1” and the P_FAIL bit will be “0”.\n●  It is not possible to set the SPBLK bit to “1” if the password had not been set prior to the Password Protection \nmode being selected.\nPassword Register (PASS)\nBits Field \nName Function Type Default State Description \n63 to 0 PWD Hidden \nPassword OTP FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFh Non-volatile OTP storage of 64 bit password.

After the device has entered Erase-Suspended mode, the system can read any sector(s) or Block(s) except those being erased by the suspended erase operation. Reading the sector or Block being erase suspended is invalid. \nAfter erase suspend, WEL bit will be clear, only read related, resume and reset command can be accepted.

Users may use ESB to identify the state \nof flash memory. After the flash memory is suspended by Erase Suspend command, ESB is set to "1".  ESB is cleared to "0" after erase operation resumes.\n9-42.  Program Suspend\nProgram suspend allows the interruption of all program operations. After the device has entered Program-\nSuspended mode, the system can read any sector(s) or Block(s) except those be  ing programmed by the suspended  \nprogram operation. Reading the sector or Block being program suspended is invalid. \nAfter program suspend, WEL bit will be cleared, only read related, resume and reset command can be accepted. \n(including: 03h, 0Bh, 3Bh, 6Bh, BBh, EBh, ECh, EDh, EEh, 0Ch, BCh, 3Ch, 5Ah, C0h, 06h, 04h, 2Bh, 9Fh, AFh, 05h, ABh, 90h, B1h, C1h, B0h, 30h, 66h, 99h, 00h, 35h, F5h, 15h, 2Dh, 27h, A7h, E2h, E0h, 16h)\nProgram Suspend Bit (PSB) indicates the status of Program Suspend operation. Users may use PSB to identify the \nstate of flash memory. After the flash memory is suspended by Program Suspend command, PSB is set to "1".  PSB is cleared to "0" after program operation resumes.\n100\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 111. Suspend to Read Latency\nFigure 112.

Write-Resume\nThe Write operation is being resumed when Write-Resume instruction issued. ESB or PSB (suspend status bit) in \nStatus register will be changed back to “0”.\nThe operation of Write-Resume is as follows: CS# drives low → send write resume command cycle (30H) → drive \nCS# high. By polling Busy Bit in status register, the internal write operation status could be checked to be completed or not. The user may also wait the time lag of tSE, tBE, tPP for Sector-erase, Block-erase or Page-programming. WREN (command "06h") is not required to issue before resume. Resume to another suspend operation requireslatency time of tPRS or tERS, as defined in \n"Table 25. AC CHARACTERISTICS  (Temperature = -40°C to 85°C, VCC = \n2.7V-3.6V)".  \nPlease note that, if "performance enhance mode" is executed during suspend operation, the device can not be resumed. To restart the write command, disable the "performance enhance mode" is required. After the "performance enhance mode" is disabled, the write-resume command is effective.\n9-44.  No Operation (NOP)\nThe “No Operation” command is only able to terminate the Reset Enable (RSTEN) command and will not affect any other command. \nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) command cycle can be accepted by this instruction. The SIO[3:1] are don\'t \ncare during SPI mode.\n9-45.  Software Reset (Reset-Enable (RSTEN) and Reset (RST))\nThe Software Reset operation combines two instructions: Reset-Enable (RSTEN) command and Reset (RST) command. It returns the device to standby mode. All the volatile bits and settings will be cleared then, which makes the device return to the default status as power on.\nTo execute Reset command (RST), the Reset-Enable (RSTEN) command must be executed first to perform the \nReset operation. If there is any other command to interrupt after the Reset-Enable command, the Reset-Enable will be invalid.\nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) command cycle can be accepted by this instruction. The SIO[3:1] are don\'t \ncare during SPI mode.\nIf the Reset command is executed during program or erase operation, the operation will be disabled, the data under \nprocessing could be damaged or lost.\nThe reset time is different depending on the last operation. For details, please refer to \n"Table 21. Reset Timing-(Other \nOperation)"  for tREADY2.\n102\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix ProprietaryFigure 114.

Read SFDP Mode (RDSFDP)\nThe Serial Flash Discoverable Parameter (SFDP) standard provides a consistent method of describing the functional \nand feature capabilities of serial flash devices in a standard set of internal parameter tables. These parameter tables can be interrogated by host system software to enable adjustments needed to accommodate divergent features from multiple vendors. The concept is similar to the one found in the Introduction of JEDEC Standard, JESD68 on CFI.\nThe sequence of issuing RDSFDP instruction is CS# goes low→send RDSFDP instruction (5Ah)→send 3 address \nbytes on SI pin→send 1 dummy byte on SI pin→read SFDP code on SO→to end RDSFDP operation can use CS# to high at any time during data out. \nSFDP is a JEDEC standard, JESD216B.\nFigure 117.

POWER-ON STATE\nThe device is in the states below when power-up:\n - Standby mode (please n ote it is not deep power-down mode)\n - W rite Enable Latch (WEL) bit is reset\nThe device must not be selected during power-up and power-down stage unless the VCC achieves below correct \nlevel:\n - VCC minimum at power- up stage and then after a delay of tVSL\n - GND at power-down\nPlease note that a pull-up resistor on CS# may ensure a safe and proper power-up/down level.\nAn internal power-on reset (POR) circuit may protect the device from data corruption and inadvertent data change \nduring power up state. When VCC is lower than VWI (POR threshold voltage value), the internal logic is reset and the flash device has no response to any command.\nFor further protection on the device, if the VCC does not reach the VCC minimum level, the correct operation is not \nguaranteed. The write, erase, and program command should be sent after the below time delay:\n - tVSL  after VCC reached VCC minimum level\nThe device can accept read command after VCC reached VCC minimum and a time delay of tVSL.Please refer to the \n"Figure 126. Power-up Timing" .\nNote:\n -  To stabilize the VCC level, the VCC rail decoupled by a suitable capacitor close to package pins is \nrecommended. (generally around 0.1uF)\n - At power-down stage, the VCC drops below VWI level, all operations are disable and device has no response \nto any command. The data corruption might occur during the stage while a write, program, erase cycle is in progress.\n119\nRev. 1.7, July 20, 2020MX25L51245G\nP/N: PM2006 Macronix Proprietary12.
