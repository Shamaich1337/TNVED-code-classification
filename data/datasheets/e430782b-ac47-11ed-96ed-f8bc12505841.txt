Using Analog Devices, Inc., temperature drift \ncurvature correction and extra im planted junction FET ( XFET) \ntechnology, voltage change vs. temperature nonlinearity in the \nADR441- EP is greatly minimized.  \nThe XFET reference  offer s better noise performance than  buried \nZener references, and the XFET reference operate s off \nlow supply volta ge headroom ( 500 mV). This combination of \nfeatures makes the ADR441- EP ideally suited for precision \nsignal conversion applications in high end data acquisition \nsystem s, military communication , and avionics  applications.  The ADR441- EP has the capability to source up to + 10 mA of \noutput current and sink up to − 5 mA. The device also comes \nwith a trim terminal to adjust the output voltage over a 0.5% range wi thout compromising performance.  \nThe ADR441- EP is available in an 8-lead, narrow SOIC package . \nThe ADR441- EP is specified  over the m ilitary temperature range \nof −55°C to +125°C .
