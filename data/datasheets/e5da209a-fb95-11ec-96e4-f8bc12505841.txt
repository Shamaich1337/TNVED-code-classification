Function Description s \nCMT2300A is an ultra-low power, high performance transceiver chip. It support s OOK, (G) FSK  and (G) MSK .It is suitable for \napplications in the range  from 140 to 1020MHz. The product belongs to CMOSTEK NextGenRFTM series . The series includes \ntransmitters, receivers and transceivers and other complete product lines. CMT2300A  block diagram is as shown in the following \nfigure.  \nMODEM\nPacket Handler\nFIFOAFC LOOP\nAGC LOOPLNAI LMT\nQ LMT\nRSSI\nADCSPI, FIFO\nInterfaceRegisters\nD-DIVLOOP\nFILTERCP PFD\nM-DIV\nRadio\nControllerLDOs PORBand-\ngapLFOSC\n26 Mhz \nXOVCO\nSDIOSCLKCSBVDD\nGND\nRXIP\nRXINXINXOUT\nIO\nCtrlFCSB\nGPIO 1\nGPIO 2\nGPIO 3PA PA\n \nFigure 4. Functional Block Diagram  \n \nIn the receiver part, the chip uses LNA+MIXER+IFFILTER+LIMITTER+PLL low -IF architecture to achieve the Sub -GHz wireless \nreception function. The chip uses PLL+PA architecture to achieve the Sub-GHz wireless transmitting function.  \n \nIn the receiver system, the analog circuit mixes the RF signal to IF and converts the signal from analog to digital through t he \nLimiter module, then outputs I/Q two single bit signals to the digital circuit for (G) FSK demodulation. At the same time, SARADC \nwill convert the real -time RSSI signal to 8 -bit digital signal, and sent them to the digital part for OOK demodulation and other \nprocessing. The digital circuit is responsible for mixing the intermediate frequency  to zero frequency (Baseband) and performing \na series of filtering and decision processing, while AFC and AGC control the analog circuit dynamically, finally the 1 -bit original \nsignal is demodulated. After demodulation, the signal will be sent to the decod er to decode and fill in the FIFO, or output to the \nPAD directly.  \n \nIn the transmitter system, the digital circuitry will encode the data and then send them to the modulator (or send them to th e \nmodulator directly without encoding). The modulator will direc tly control the PLL and PA, modulate the data by (G) FSK or OOK \nand transmit them.  \n \nThe chip provides the SPI communication port. The external MCU can configure the various functions by accessing to the \nregister, control the main state machine, and access to the FIFO.  \n \n4.1 Transmitter  \nThe transmitter is  based on direct frequency synthesis technology . The carrier is generated by a low noise fractional -N frequency \nsynthesizer.  \n \nThe modulated data is transmitted by an efficient single -ended power amplifier (PA) . The output power can be read and written \n \n \nCMT2300A  \n \n \nRev 1.0 | Page 22/46 \n www.cmostek.com  via register s, step by step from -20dBm to +20dBm with 1dB.  \n \nWhen the PA is switched fast, the varying input impedance will disturb the output frequency of the VCO instantaneously . The \neffect iscalled VCO pulling . It will generate the spurious and spurs on the spectrum around the desired carrier .The PA spurs can be \nreduced to a minimum instantaneously by thePA output power  ramping . CMT2300A has a built-in PA ramping mechanism. When \nthe PA Ramp is turned on, the PA o utput power can ramp the desired amplitude in a pre -configured  rate, so as to reduce the \nspurs .In FSK mode, the signal can be filtered by a Gaussian Filter before transmitted, e.g. GFSK, which can reduce the spectral \nwidth and interference with neighboring  channels.  \n \nAccording to different application requirements, the user can design a PA matching network to optimize the transmitting effic iency. \nThe typical application schematic and the required BOM is shown in  Chapter 3 "Typical application schematic". F or more \nschematic details and layout guidelines, please refer to “AN141 CMT230 0A Schematic and PCB Layout Design Guideline”.  \n \nThe transmitter can operate in direct mode and package mode. In the direct mode, the data to be transmitted can be sent to the \nchip by the DIN pin and transmitted directly. In the package mode, the data can be pre -loaded into the TX FIFO in STBY s tate, \nand transmitted together with other package elements.  \n \n4.2 Receiver  \nCMT2300A has a built -in ultra-low power, high performance low-IF OOK, FSK receiver. The RF signal induced by the antennais \namplified by a low noise amplifier, and is converted to an intermediate frequency by an orthogonal mixer. The signal is filte red by \nthe image rejection filter, and is amplified by the limiting am plifier and then sent to the digital domain for digital demodulation. \nDuring power on reset (POR) each analog block  is calibrated to the internal reference voltage. This allows the chip to remain its \nbest performance  at different temperatures and voltages.  Baseband filtering and demodulation isdone  by the digital \ndemodulator. The AGC loop adjust the system gain by the broadband power detector and attenuation network nearby LNA, so as \nto obtain the best system linearity, selectivity, sensitivity and other per formance.  \n \nLeveraging CMOSTEK\'s low power design technology, the receiver consumes only a very low power when it is turned on . The \nperiodic operation mode and wake up function can further reduce the average power consumption of the system in the \napplication  with strict requirements of power consumption.  \n \nSimilar to the transmitter, the CMT2300A receiver can operate in direct mode and packet mode.In the direct mode, the \ndemodulator output data can be directly output through the DOUT pin of the chip. DOUT can be assigned to  GPIO1/2/3. In the \npacket mode, the demodulator data output is sent to the data packet handler, get decodedand is filled in the FIFO. MCU can read \nthe FIFO by the SPI interface.  \n \n4.3 Auxiliary Blocks  \n4.3.1  Power -On Reset (POR)  \nThe Power -On Reset circuit detect the change of the VDD power supply, and generate the reset signal for the entire CMT2300A \nsystem. After the POR, the MCU must go through the initialization process and re -configure the CMT2300A. There are two \ncircumstances  those will lead to the generation of POR.  \n \nThe first case is a very short and sudden decrease  of VDD. The POR trigger ing condition is, VDD dramatically decreases by 0.9V \n+/- 20% (e.g. 0.72V – 1.08V) within less than 2 us.

Slow Decrease of VDD lead to Generation of POR  \n \n4.3.2  Crystal Oscillator  \nThe crystal oscillator provides a reference clock for the phase locked loop as well as a system clock for the digital circuits . The \nvalue of load capacitance depends on the crystal specified CL parameters. The total load capacitance between XI and XO should \nbe equal to CL, in order  to make the crystal accurately oscillate at 26 MHz.  \n \n    \n                       \n \nC15 and C1 6 are the load capacitancesat both ends of the crystal. Cpar is the parasitic capacitance on the PCB. Each crystal pin \nhas 5pF internal parasitic capacitance, together  is equivalent to 2.5pF. The equivalent series resistance of the crystal must  be \nwithin the specifications so that the crystal can have a reliable vibration. Also, a n external signal source can be connected to the \nXI pin to replace the conventional crystal. The recommended peak value of this clock signal is from 300mV to 700mV. The clock \nis coupled to XI pin via a blocking capacitor.  \n \n4.3.3  Sleep Timer  \nThe CMT2300A  integrates a sleep timer driven by 32 kHz low power oscillator (LPOSC). When this function is enabled, the timer \nwakes the chip from sleep periodically. When the chip operates in a duty cycle mode, the sleep time can be configured from \n0.03125 ms to 41922 560 ms. Due to the low power oscillator frequency will change wit h the temperature and voltage drift, it will \n \n \nCMT2300A  \n \n \nRev 1.0 | Page 24/46 \n www.cmostek.com  be automatically calibrated during power on and will be periodically calibrated  since then . These calibrations will keep the \nfrequency tolerance o f the oscillator within + 1%.  \n \n4.3.4  Low Battery Detection  \nThe chip sets up low voltage detection.When the chip is tuned to a certain frequency, the test is performed once.Frequency \ntuning occurs when the chip jumps from the SLEEP/STBY state to the RFS/TFS/TX/RX  state . The  result can be read by the \nLBD_VALUE register.  \n \n4.3.5  Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)  \nRSSI is used to evaluate the signal strength inside  the channel. The cascaded I/Q logarithmic amplifier amplifies the signal before \nit is sent to the demodulator. The logarithmic amplifier of I channels and Q channel contains the received signal indicator , in which \nthe DC voltage is generated is proportion al to the input signal strength. The output of RSSI is the sum of  thevalues of the two \nchannels’ signal s. The output has 80dB dynamic range above the sensitivity . After the RSSI output  is sampled by the ADC  and \nfiltered by a SAR FILTER and a RSSI AVG FILTER . The order of the average filter can be set by RSSI_AVG_MODE<2:0>. The \ncode value is translated into dBm value after filtering. Users can read the register RSSI_CODE<7:0>  to obtain the RSSI code \nvalue , or RSSI_DBM<7:0>  to obtain the dBm value.  By setting the register RSSI_DET_SEL<1:0> Users can determine whether \nthe RSSI is output to the MCU in real time, or latched at the instance when the preamble, sync, or the whole packet is receiv ed.   \n \nAlso, CMT2300A allows the user to setup a threshold by RSSI_TRIG_TH<7:0> to compare with the real -time RSSI value. If the \nRSSI is larger than the threshold it outputs logic 1, otherwise outputs logic 0. The output can be used as a source of the RSSI \nVLD interrupt, ofthe receive time extending condition in the super low power (SLP) mode.  \nSAR \nFILTERCODE to dBm\nCONVERTSAR \nADCRSSI AVG\nFILTERRSSI_CODE<7:0>\nRSSI_DBM<7:0>RSSI_AVG_MODE<2:0>\nCOMPARE to \nRSSI_TRIG_TH<7:0>RESULTLATCH\nLATCHRSSI_DET_SEL<1:0>\nRSSI_DET_SEL<1:0>\n \nFigure 7. RSSI detection and comparison circuit  \n \nCMT2300A  has done a certain degree of calibration before delivery. In order to obtain more accurate RSSI measurement results, \nthe user needs to recalibrate the RSSI circuit in their dedicated applications . For further information , please refer to the  \n“AN144 -CMT230 0AW RSSI Usage Guideline ”. \n \n4.3.6  Phase Jump Detect or（PJD） \nPJD is Phase Jump Detector. When the chip is in FSK demodulation, itcan automatically observe the phase jump characteristics \nof the received signal to determine whether it is awanted  signal or an unwanted noise .  \n \n \n \nCMT2300A  \n \n \nRev 1.0 | Page 25/46 \n www.cmostek.com  \n2 \nSYM2 \nSYM1 \nSYM1 \nSYM1 \nSYM1 \nSYM \nFigure 8. Received signal jump di agram  \n \nThe PJD mechanism defines that the input signal switching from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 is a phase jump. Users can configure the \nPJD_WIN_SEL<1:0> to  determine  the number of detected jumps for the PJD to identify a wanted signal .As shown in the above  \nfigure , in total 8 symbols are received. But the phase jump only appeared 6 times. Therefore, the  number of  jump sis not equal to \nthe number of symbol s. Only when a preamble is received the yare equal.In general, the more jumps  are used to identify the \nsignal , the more reliable  they result  is; the less  jumps are used , the faster the result  is obtained .If the RX time is set to a relatively \nshort period , it is necessary to reduce the number of jumps  to meet the timing requirements. Normally , 4 jumps allow pretty \nreliable result , e.g. the chip will not mistakenly treat an incoming noise as a wanted signal, and vice versa will not treat a wanted \nsignal as noise.  \n \nDetecting the phase jump of a signal, is identical to  detect whether the signal has the expecteddata rate. In fact, at the same time, \nthe PJD will also detect the FSK deviation and see if it is legal, as well as to see if the SNR is over 7 dB. With these three \nparameters the PJD is able to make a very reliable judgement. If the signal is wanted it outputs logic 1, otherwise outputs logic 0. \nThe output can be used as a source of the RSSI VLD interrupt, or the receive time extending condition in the s uper low power \n(SLP) mode.  In direct data mode, by setting the DOUT_MUTE register bit to 1, the PJD can mute the FSK demodulated data \noutput while there is not wanted signal received.  \n \nThe PJD technique is similar to the traditional carrier sense technique , but more reliable. While users combine the RSSI detection \nand PJD technique, they can precisely identify the status of the current channel.  \n \n4.3.7  Automatic Frequency Control (AFC)  \nThe AFC mechanism allows the receiver to minimize the frequency error between the TX and RX in a very short time once a \nwanted signal comes in. This helps the receiver to maintain its highest sensitivity performance. CMT2300A has the most \nadvanced AFC technology. Compare with the other competitors, within the same bandwidth, CMT2300 A can identify larger \nfrequency error, and remove the error in a much shorter time (8 -10 symbols).  \n \nNormally the frequency error between the TX and RX is caused by the crystal oscillators used in both sides. CMT2300A allows \nthe user to fill in the value of crystal tolerance (in PPM) on RFPDK. Based on the crystal tolerance, t he RFPDK will calculate the \nAFC range whileminimizing the receiver bandwidth  (to maintain the best performance). Due to the excellent performance of the \nAFC, it provides a good solution to the crystal aging problem which would lead to more frequency error as time goes by. \nTherefore, co mpare to other similar transceiver chips, CMT2300A can solve more severe crystal aging problem and effectively \nextend the life time of the product. Please refer to “AN196 -CMT2300A -CMT2219B -CMT2218B The Advantages of the Receiver \nAFC.” for more details.  \n \n4.3.8  Clock Data Recovery (CDR)  \nThe basic task of a CDR system is to recover the clock signal that is synchronized with the symbol rate , while  receiving the data. \nNot only for decoding inside the chip, but also for output ting the synchronized clock  to GPIO for user s to sample the data.So \nCDR\'s task is simple and important . If the recovered clock frequency is in error with the actual symbol rate, it will cause data \nacquisition errors at the time of reception.  \n \nCMT2300A W has designed three types  of CDR systems, as fol lows:  \n \n1. COUNTING  system –The system is designed for the symbol rates to be more accurate . If the symbol rate is 100% aligned , \nthe unlimited length of 0 can be received continuously  without error.  \n \n \nCMT2300A  \n \n \nRev 1.0 | Page 26/46 \n www.cmostek.com   \n2. TRACING  system  –The system is designed to correct the symbol rate error. It has the tracking function . It can automatically \ndetect the symbol rate transmitted by  TX, and adjust quickly the local symbol rate of RX at the same time, so as to minimize \nthe error between t hem.The system can withstand up to 15.6%  or symbol rate error . Other similar products in the industry \ncannot reach this level.  \n \n3. MANCHESTER  system  –This system evolves from the COUNT ING system . The basic feature is the same .The only \ndifference is that the system is specially designed for Man chester  codec .Special processing can be done when the TX \nsymbol rate has unexpected changes . \n \n4.3.9  Fast Frequency Hopping  \nThe mechanism of fast frequency hopping is, based on the frequency configured on the RFPDFK, for instance 433.92MHz, \nduring applications the MCU can simply change 1 or 2 registers to quickly switch to another frequency channel. This simplify the \nway of change the RX or TX frequency in multiple channels application.  \n \n                                                               \n \nIn general, the user can configure FH_OFFSET<7:0>during the chip initialization  process . And then in the application, the user \ncan switch the channel by changing FH_CHANNEL<7:0>.  \n \nWhen users need to use the fast frequency hopping in the  RX mode, in some particular frequency points, one parameter of the \nAFC circuit must be re -configured. Please refer to “ AN197 -CMT2300A -CMT2119B -CMT2219B fast frequency hopping ” and \n“CMT2300A -CMT2219B frequency hopping calculation tool ” for more details.  \n \n \n  \n \n \nCMT2300A  \n \n \nRev 1.0 | Page 27/46 \n www.cmostek.com  5. Chip Operation  \n5.1 SPI Interface  \nThe chip communicates with the outside through the 4 -wire SPI interface. The CSB is the  active -lowchip select  signal  for \naccessing to the register s. The FCSB is the active -low select  signal  for accessing to the FIFO. They  cannot be set to low at the \nsame time. The SCL K is the serial clock .Its highest  speed is 5MHz .The chip itself and the external MCU send the data at the \nfalling edge of SCL K and capture  the data at the rising edge of SCL K. The SDA is a bidirectional pin fo r input and output data. \nThe address and data are transferred starting from the MSB.  \n \nWhen accessing  to the register, CSB is pulled low. A R/W bit  is sent  first, followed by a 7-bit register address. After the external \nMCU pulls down the CSB, it must wait for at least half a SCL cycle, and then send the R/W bit. After the MCU sends out the la st \nfalling edge of SCL K, it must wait for at least half a SCL K cycle, and then pull the CSB h igh. \n \nTo be noticed, when reading a register , MCU and CMT2300A will have to switch the direction of their IO (SDIO) between the \naddress bit 0 and the data bit 7. It is required that the MCU switches the IO to input mode before send out the falling edge of the \nSCLK; CMT2300A should switch the IO to output mode after it has seen the falling edge of the SCLK. This avoids data \ncontention of the SDIO (both of the MCU and CMT2300A set the SDIO to output mode at the same time), which would cause \nunexpected electri cal problem.  \n \nSCLKCSB\nSDIO   X 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  X  \nregister address register read data0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nr/w = 1FCSB> 0.5 SCLK cycle > 0.5 SCLK cycle\n \nFigure 9.

SPI write register timing  \n \n5.2 FIFO  \nCMT2300A provides two separated 32 -byte FIFO by default. They are used for RX and TX , respectively. Users can also set \n \n \nCMT2300A  \n \n \nRev 1.0 | Page 28/46 \n www.cmostek.com  FIFO_MARGE_EN to 1  to merge the two separated FIFO into one 64-byte FIFO. It can be used both under TX and RX. By \nconfiguring the FIFO_RX_TX_SEL to indicate whether it is currently used as TX FIFO or RX  FIFO . When the two FIFO are not \nmerged, users can fill in the TX FIFO while the RX FIFO is used to receive data in the RX mode.  \n \nThe FIFO can be accessedvia  the SPI interface. The user can clear the FIFO by setting FIFO_CLR_TX or FIFO_CLR_ RX to 1. \nAlso, the user can  re-send t he old datain the TX FIFO  by setting FIFO_RESTORE  to 1, without the need of re -filling the data . \n \n5.2.1  FIFO Read Operation  \nWhen the MCU accesses to the FIFO, the user must first configure a few registers to setup  the FIFO read /write mode, as well as \nsome other working mode.  The details are  introduced in “AN143-CMT2 219B  FIFO and Data Packet Usage Guideline ”. Here is \nthe read -write timing diagram. Note that there is a slight difference in the control of the FCSB for accessing to the FIFO and the \ncontrol of the CSB  for accessing to the register. When the MCU starts to access to the FIFO, FCSB must be pulled down 1 -clock \ncycle at first, and then send the rising edge of SCL. After the last falling edge of SCL is sent, the MCU must wait at least 2 us to \npull up the FCSB. Between the adjacent read/write operations, the FCSB must be pulled high for 4us at least. When writing the \nFIFO, the first bit data must be ready 0.5 clock cycles before sending the first rising edge of SCL.  \n \nSCLKFCSB\nSDIO   X  X  \nFIFO read data0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 X   \nFIFO read dataCSB> 1 SCLK cycle > 4 us > 2 us > 2 us > 1 SCLK cycle\n \nFigure 11.

CMT2300A TX FIFO interrupt timing  diagram  \n \n5.3 Operation State, Timing  and Power Consumption  \n5.3.1  Startup Timing  \nAfter the chip VDD is powered up, the chip usually needs to wait about 1ms, then POR will release. After the release of the P OR, \nthe crystal will start, the start time is 200 us - 1 ms, depending on the characteristics of the crystal itself. After starting , the user \nneed to wait for the crystal settled, then the system starts  working. The default setting is 2.48ms. This time can be modified by \nwriting XTAL_STB_TIME <2:0> afterword (it has to be longer than the crystal inherent settling time). However, if th e inherent \nsettling time of the crystal is difficult to observed by the user, the default setting of 2.48 ms is recommended and is able to cover \nmost of the crystals.  \n \nThe chip remains in the IDLE status until the crystal is settled. After the crystal is settled, the chip will leave the IDLE state and \nbegin to do the calibration of each module. After the calibration is completed, the chip will stay in the SLEEP and wait unti l the \nuser to initialize the configuration. At any time, as long as the soft reset is performed, the chip will go back to the IDLE and be \npowered up again.  \n \n \n \nCMT2300A  \n \n \nRev 1.0 | Page 30/46 \n www.cmostek.com  \nPORVDD\nPOR Release \n<= 1 msXTAL Stablize \n<= 2.5 msBlock Calibrations\n<= 6.5 msEnters the SLEEP State Ready \nfor customer initializingXTAL Start up\n<= N ms \nFigure 15.

State Switch Diagram  \n \n\uf06e SLEEP State  \nThe chip power consumption is the lowest in SLEEP state, and almost all the modules are turned off. SPI is open, the registers of \nthe configuration bank and control bank 1 will be saved, and the contents filled in the FIFO before will remain unchanged. \nHowever, the user cannot operate the FIFO and cannot change the contents of the register. If the user opens the wake -up \nfunction, the LFOSC and the sleep counter will turn on and start working. The time required to switch from IDLE to SLEEP is t he \npower up time. Switch from other state to SLE EP will be completed immediately.  \n \n\uf06e STBY State \nIn STBY state, the crystal is turned on, the LDO of the digital circuit will also be turned on, the current will be slightly increased, \nand the FIFO can be operated. The user can choose whether to output CLKO ( system clock) to PIN. Because the crystal and \nLDO is turned on, compared to the SLEEP, the time switching from the STBY to transmitting or receiving will be relatively sho rt. \nSwitching from SLEEP to STBY will be completed after the crystal is turned on and  settled. Switching from other state to STBY \nwill be completed immediately.  \n \n\uf06e RFS State \nRFS is a transition state before switching to RX. Except that the receiver RF module is off, the other modules are turned on,  and \nthe current will be larger than STBY. B ecause PLL has been locked in the RX frequency, RFS cannot switch to TX. Switching \nfrom STBY to RFS probably requires PLL calibration and stability time of 350us. Switching from SLEEP to RFS needs to add the \ncrystal start -up and stability time. Switching f rom other state to RFS will be completed immediately.  \n \n\uf06e TFS State \nTFS is a transition state before switching to TX. Except that the transmitter RF module is off, the other modules are turned on, \nand the current will be larger than STBY. Because PLL has been  locked in the TX frequency, TFS cannot switch to RX. Switching \nfrom STBY to TFS probably requires PLL calibration and stability time of 350us. Switching from SLEEP to TFS needs to add the \n \n \nCMT2300A  \n \n \nRev 1.0 | Page 32/46 \n www.cmostek.com  crystal start -up and settled time. Switching from other state to TF S will be completed immediately.  \n \n\uf06e RX State \nAll modules on the receiver will be opened in RX state. Switching from RFS to RX requires only 20us. Switching from STBY to R X \nneeds to add the PLL calibration and settled time of 350us. Switching from SLEEP to RX  needs to add the crystal start -up and \nsettled time. TX can be quickly switched to RX by sending go_switch command. Whether the TX and RX setting frequency is the \nsame, the user need to wait for the PLL re -calibration and settled time of 350us to switch su ccessfully.  \n \n\uf06e TX State \nAll modules on the transmitter will be opened in TX state. Switching from TFS to TX requires only 20us. Switching from STBY t o \nTX needs to add the PLL calibration and settled time of 350us. Switching from SLEEP to TX needs to add the crystal start -up and \nsettled time. RX can be quickly switched to TX by sending go_switch command. Whether the RX and TX setting frequency is the \nsame, the user need to wait for the PLL re -calibration and settled time of 350us to switch successfully.  \n \n5.4 GPIO and Interrupt  \nCMT2300A  has 3 GPIO ports.Each GPIO can be configured as a different input or output.

In Tx mode, only supports  transmitting the  data input from GPIO . \n\uf06e Packet Mode – Supports all packet formats, demodulated data is stored in FIFO , accessed by SPI.  \n \n6.1 Direct Mode  \n \nMODEM\ndataclock\n1\n1\nUser RegistersEEPROM (CMT Parameters)\nRF\nSPICSB \nSCLK\nSDIODCLK\nDOUT/DINPreamble (Opt)\nSync (Opt)dataclock\n1\n1\nINT1/INT2\n \nFigure 5. Direct mode data path  \n \nRx processing  \n \nIn direct mode, the data from the demodulator is sent directly to the external MCU via the DOUT pin. DOUT can be set to GPIO1, \n2 or 3.The typical RX direct mode controlsequence for the MCU is: \n \n1. Configur es GPIOs using the CUS_IO_SEL register . \n2. Configures DATA_MODE = 0 . \n3. Send  thego_rx command .  \n4. Capture  the da ta from DOUT continuously.  \n5. Send  thego_sleep/go_stby/go_rfs command to stop receiving and save the power . \n \nTx processing  \n \nIn the direct mode, the data to be transmitted is sent directly to the chip from the external MCU by via DIN pin. The data rate is \ndetermined  by the MCU  but must be less than +/ - 30% of the data rate configured on the RFPDK . The typical TX direct mode  \ncontrol sequence for the MCU is:  \n \n1. Set r egister TX_DIN_EN to 1 to  enable  DIN on GPIO . \n2. Set TX_DIN_SEL  to 0 to configure GPIO1  as DIN , or 1 to configure GPIO2  as DIN .  \n3.

The packet handler provides a variety of decoding mechanisms  and options to determine the validity of the data. These \ncan reduce the work load of the MCU. The typical package mode control sequence for the MCU is:  \n \n1. Configures GPIO using the CUS_ IO_SE L register.  \n2. Setup the  interrupt susing CUS_INT1_CTL, CUS_INT2_CTL  and CUS_INT_EN  registers . \n3. Send  thego_rx  command . \n4. Reads the RX FIFO according to the relevant interrupt s. \n5. Sends the go_sleep/go_stby/go_rfs  command to stop the receiving and save the power.  \n6. Clears the packet interrupt susing CUS_ INT_CLR1  and CUS_INT_CLR2 registers . \n \nTx processing  \n \nIn the packet mode, MCU can fill the data in the FIFO in advance in the STBY and TFS state, or fill them in the FIFO while th e \nchip sends the data, or use the combination of the above two methods. The typical Txpacket mo de control sequence for the MCU \nis: \n \n1. Configures GPIO usingthe CUS_IO_SEL  register  \n2. Sends go_stby/go_tfs  command when the data is filled in FIFO in advance.  \n3. Sends go_tx  command.  \n4. Writes the data into FIFO according to the relevant interrupt status . \n5. Sends go_sleep/go_stby/go_rfs  command to save power.  \n \nCMT2300A has rich configurable hardware resources of FIFO, packet and their interrupts, which makes it compatible with most \nof the similar RF products in the market.

Low Power Operation  \n7.1 Duty Cycle Operation Mode \nCMT2300A makes the Tx and Rx work in duty cycle operation mode to save  the power consumption.Among them, the Rx Duty \nCycle can be classified  into the following 5 modes.  \n \n1. Fully manual control  \n2. Automatic  SLEEP wakeup, switch to manual control  \n3. Automatic SLEEP wakeup, automatic allyenter  to RX , manually exit RX  \n4. Automatic SLEEP wakeup, manually enter RX, automatic ally exit RX  \n5. Fully a utomatic receive and sleep control  \n \nThe Tx Duty Cycle can be divided into the following 3 modes.  \n \n1. Manually enter TX, a utomatic ally exit TX  \n2. Automatic SLEEP wakeup, manually enter TX, automatic ally exit TX  \n3. Fully a utomatic  transmit and sleep control  \n \n7.2 Supper Low Power (SLP) Receive M ode \nCMT2300A provides a set of options to help users achieve supper low power consumption (SLP - Supper Low Power) reception \nunder different application requirements.These options  can be used whensetting  RX_TIMER_EN to 1, e.g. w hen the Rx timer is \nenabled . The  principle of the SLP mechanism  is to shorten the Rx time when there is no wanted signal coming in, and properly \nextend the Rx time when there is wanted signal  detected, so th at the power consumption is minimized while  the stability of \nreception  is guaranteed . \n \nThe traditional short -range wireless receiver  generally uses the following basic scheme to achieve low \npower communication .CMT2300A is also compatible with this scheme, a nd expands  it to 13 more power -saving schemes. The \nfigure below  introduce s the most basic scheme , whichwill be enabled when the RX_EXTEND_MODE<3:0> is set to 0.  \n \nOne Packet\nIDLE\nIDLE\nIDLELength of Packet x 2 + \nPacket Gap < RX Time TX Burst Time > RX Cycle\nTX starts transmittion\nMissed Received\nXTAL, \nTUNERX Sleep\nRX Cycle < TX Burst TimeSLEEP\nReceiving Sleeping XTAL stabilizing \nand Frequency Tuningt\ntIDLE\nSLEEP SLEEP SLEEPTX starts transmittion\nReceivedTx DATA\nRx Time\n \nFigure 23.
