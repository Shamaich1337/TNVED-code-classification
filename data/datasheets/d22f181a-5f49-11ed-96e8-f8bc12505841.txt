It can deliver up to 4A (DC current) for each output with few external input and output capacitors. This module provides precisely regulated output voltages programmable via external resistors from 0.8VDC to 5.0VDC over 4.5V to 26.5V input voltages. The typical application schematic is shown in Figure 19.\nThe L TM4619 has integrated constant frequency current \nmode regulators and built-in power MOSFET devices with fast switching speed. The typical switching frequency is 780kHz. To reduce switching noise, the two outputs are interleaved with 180° phase internally and can be synchro -\nnized externally using the MODE/PLLIN pin.\nWith current mode control and internal feedback loop \ncompensation, the L TM4619 module has sufficient stabil -\nity margins and good transient per\nformance with a wide \nrange of \noutput capacitors, even with all ceramic output \ncapacitors.\nCurrent mode control provides cycle-by-cycle fast current \nlimit and current foldback in a short-circuit condition. Internal overvoltage and undervoltage comparators pull the open-drain PGOOD output low if the output feedback voltage exits a ±7.5% window around the regulation point. The power good pin is disabled during start-up.\nPulling the RUN pin below 1.2V forces the controller into \nits shutdown state, by turning off both MOSFETs. The  \nTK/SS pin is used for programming the output voltage ramp and voltage tracking during start-up. See the Ap -\nplications Information section.\nThe L TM4619 is internally compensated to be stable over \nall operating conditions. L\nTpowerCAD™ is available for \ntransient and stability analysis. The V FB pin is used to \nprogram the output voltage with a single external resistor \nto ground. Multiphase operation can be easily employed with the synchronization. \nHigh efficiency at light loads can be accomplished with \nselectable Burst Mode operation or pulse-skipping mode using the MODE/PLLIN pin.

T wo 1.5µF input ceramic capacitors are included inside the module. Additional input capacitors are needed if a large load is required up to the 4A level. A 47µF to 100µF surface mount aluminum electrolytic capacitor can be used for more input bulk capacitance. This bulk capacitor is only needed if the input source im -\npedance is compromised by long inductive leads, traces or not enough sour ce capacitance. \nFor a buck converter\n, the switching duty-cycle can be \nestimated as:\n  D=VOUT\nVINWithout considering the inductor ripple current, for each output, the RMS current of the input capacitor can be estimated as:\n  ICIN(RMS) =IOUT(MAX)\nη•D•(1−D)\nIn the above equation, η is the estimated efficiency of the power module. The bulk capacitor can be a switcher-rated aluminum electrolytic capacitor or a polymer capacitor . One 10µF ceramic input capacitor is typically rated for 2A of RMS ripple current, so the RMS input current at the worst case for each output at 4A maximum current is about 2A. If a low inductance plane is used to power the device, then two 10µF ceramic capacitors are enough for both outputs at 4A load and no external input bulk capacitor is required. \nOutput Capacitors\nThe L TM4619 is designed for low output voltage ripple \nnoise. The bulk output capacitors defined as C\nOUT are \nchosen with low enough effective series resistance (ESR) to meet the output voltage ripple and transient require -\nments. C\nOUT can be a low ESR tantalum capacitor , a low \nESR polymer capacitor or ceramic capacitor . The typical output capacitance range for each output is from 47µF to 220µF . Additional output filtering may be required by the system designer . If further reduction of output ripple or dynamic transient spikes is required, L TpowerCAD is available for stability analysis. Multiphase operation will reduce effective output ripple as a function of the num -\nber of phases. Application Note 77 discusses this noise reduction versus output ripple current cancellation, but the output capacitance should be considered carefully as a function of stability and transient response.  L TpowerCAD\n  \ncalculates the output ripple reduction as the number of implemented phases increased by N times.applica Tions inForMaTion\nLTM461910\n4619fc For more information www.linear .com/L TM4619Mode Selections and Phase-Locked Loop\nThe L TM4619 can be enabled to enter high efficiency \nBurst Mode operation, constant-frequency pulse-skipping mode, or forced continuous conduction mode. To select the forced continuous operation, tie the MODE/PLLIN pin to a DC voltage below 0.8V . To select pulse-skipping mode of operation, tie the MODE/PLLIN pin to INTV\nCC. To select \nBurst Mode operation, float the MODE/PLLIN pin.\nFrequency Synchronization\nA phase-lock loop is available on the L TM4619 to syn -\nchronize the internal clock to an external clock source \nconnected on the MODE/PLLIN pin. The clock high level needs to be higher than 1.6V and the clock low level needs to be lower than 1V . The frequency programming voltage \nand or the programming voltage divider must be removed from the FREQ/PLLFL\nTR pin when synchronizing to an \nexternal clock. The FREQ/PLLFL TR pin has the required onboard PLL filter components for clock synchronization. The L TM4619 will default to forced continuous mode while being clock synchronized. Channel 1 is synchronized to the rising edge on the external clock, and channel 2 is 180 degrees out-of-phase with the external clock.applica Tions in ForMaTion\nFrequency Selection\nThe switching frequency of the L TM4619’s controllers \ncan be selected using the FREQ/PLLFL TR pin. If the MODE/PLLIN pin is not being driven by an external clock source, the FREQ/PLLFL TR pin can be set from 0V to 2.4V to program the controller’s operating frequency from 250kHz to 780kHz using a voltage divider to INTV\nCC (see Figure \n20). The typical frequency is 780kHz. If the output is too low or the minimum on-time is reached, the frequency needs to decrease to enlarge the turn-on time. Otherwise, a significant amount of cycle skipping can occur with cor -\nrespondingly larger current and voltage ripple.\nFigure 2.

Example of Coincident T rackingOutput voltage tracking can be programmed externally \nusing the TK/SS pin. The master channel is divided down with an external resistor divider that is the same as the slave channel’s feedback divider to implement coincident tracking. The L TM4619 uses an accurate 60.4k resistor internally for the top feedback resistor . Figure 3 shows an example of coincident tracking. Figure 4 shows the output voltages with coincident tracking.\n  VSLAVE =1+R1\nR2\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7•VTRACK\nVTRACK  is the track ramp applied to the slave’s TK/SS2 \npin. V TRACK  has a control range of 0V to 0.8V . When the \nmaster’s output is divided down with the same resistor \nvalues used to set the slave’s output, then the slave will coincident track with the master until it reaches its final value. The master will continue to its final value from the slave’s regulation point.\nRatiometric modes of tracking can be achieved by select -\ning different divider resistors values to change the output \ntracking ratio. The master output must be greater than the slave output for the tracking to work. Master and slave data inputs can be used to implement the correct resistors values for coincident or ratiometric tracking.Soft-Start and T racking\nThe L\nTM4619 has the ability to either soft-start by itself \nwith a capacitor or track the output of another channel or external supply. When one particular channel is configured to soft-start by itself, a capacitor should be connected to its TK/SS pin. This channel is in the shutdown state if its RUN pin voltage is below 1.2V . Its TK/SS pin is actively pulled to ground in this shutdown state.\nOnce the RUN pin voltage is above 1.2V , the channel pow -\ners up. A soft-start current of 1.3µA then starts to charge \nits soft-start capacitor . Note that soft-start or tracking is \nachieved not by limiting the maximum output current of the controller but by controlling the output ramp voltage according to the ramp rate on the TK/SS pin. Current foldback is disabled during this phase to ensure smooth soft-start or tracking. The soft-start or \ntracking range is \ndefined to be the voltage range from 0V to 0.8V on the TK/SS pin. The total soft-start time can be calculated as:\n  tSOFT-START =0.8V •CSS\n1.3µA\nFigure 4.

Figure 5 provides a ratio of input RMS ripple current to DC load current as a function of duty cycle and the number of paralleled phases. Choose the corresponding duty cycle and the number of phases to get the correct ripple current value. For example, the 2-phase parallel for one L TM4619 design provides 8A at 2.5V output from a 12V input. The duty cycle is DC = 2.5V/12V = 0.21. The 2-phase curve has a ratio of ~0.25 for a duty cycle of 0.21. This 0.25 ratio of RMS ripple cur -\nrent to a DC load current of 8A equals ~2A of input RMS ripple current for the external input capacitors.\nThe effective output ripple \ncurrent is lowered with mul -\ntiphase operations as well. Figure 6 provides a ratio of \npeak-to-peak output ripple current to the normalized \noutput ripple current as a function of duty cycle and the number of paralleled phases. Choose the corresponding duty cycle and the number of phases to get the correct output ripple current ratio value. If a 2-phase operation is \nchosen at 12V IN to 2.5V OUT with a duty cycle of 21%, \nthen 0.6 is the ratio of the normalized output ripple cur -\nrent to inductor ripple DIr at zero duty cycle. This leads to ~1.3A \nof the effective output ripple current ΔI L if the \nDIr is at 2.2A. Refer to Application Note 77 for a detailed explanation of the output ripple current reduction as a function of paralleled phases. \nThe output ripple voltage has two components that are \nrelated to the amount of bulk capacitance and effective series resistance (ESR) of the output bulk capacitance. Therefore, the output ripple voltage can be calculated with the known effective output ripple current. The equation:\n ΔVOUT(P-P)  ≈ ΔI L/(8 • f • N • C OUT) + ESR • ΔI L\nwhere f is frequency and N is the number of parallel phases.applica Tions inForMaTion\nRUN Pin\nThe RUN pins can be used to enable or sequence the \nparticular regulator channel. The RUN pins have their own internal 0.5µA current source to pull up the pin to 1.2V , and then the current increases to 4.5µA above 1.2V . Careful consideration is needed to assure that board contamination or residue does not load down the 0.5µA pull-up current. Otherwise active control to these pins can be used to en -\nable the regulators. A voltage divider can be used from V\nIN to set an enable point that can also be used as a UVLO \nfeature for the regulator . The resistor divider needs to be low enough resistance to swamp out the pull-up current sources to prevent unintended activation of the device. See the Simplified Block Diagram.\nPower Good\nThe PGOOD pin is connected to the open drain of an internal \nN-channel MOSFET . The MOSFET turns on and pulls the PGOOD pin low when either V\nFB pin voltage is not within \n±7.5% of the 0.8V reference voltage. The PGOOD pin is also pulled low when either RUN pin is below 1.2V or when the L TM4619 is in the soft-start or tracking phase. When the V\nFB pin voltage is within the ±7.5% requirement, the \nMOSFET is turned off and the pin is allowed to be pulled up by an external resistor to a source of up to 6V . The PGOOD pin will flag power good immediately when both V\nFB pins are within the ±7.5% window. However , there is \nan internal 17µs power bad mask when either V FB goes \nout of the ±7.5% window.\nLTM461914\n4619fc For more information www.linear .com/L TM4619applica Tions in ForMaTion\nINTV CC and EXTV CC\nThe INTV CC is the internal 5V regulator that powers the \nL TM4619 internal circuitry and drives the power MOSFETs. \nThe input voltage of the L TM4619 must be 6V or above for the INTV\nCC to regulate to the proper 5V level due to \nthe internal LDO dropout from the input voltage. For ap -\nplications that need to operate below 6V input, then the input voltage \ncan be connected directly to the EXTV CC \npin to bypass the LDO dropout concern, or an external 5V supply can be used to power the EXTV\nCC pin when \nthe input voltage is at high end of the supply range to reduce power dissipation in the module. For example the dropout voltage for 24V input would be 24V – 5V = 19V . This 19V headroom then multiplied by the power MOSFET drive current of ~15mA would equal ~0.3W additional power dissipation. So utilizing an external 5V supply on the EXTV\nCC would improve design efficiency and reduce \ndevice temperature rise.\nSlope Compensation\nThe module has already been internally compensated for \nall output voltages. L TpowerCAD is available for control loop optimization.\nBurst Mode Operation and Pulse-Skipping Mode\nThe L TM4619 regulator can be placed into high efficiency \npower saving modes at light load condition to conserve power . The Burst Mode operation can be selected by float -\ning the MODE/PLLIN pin, and pulse-skipping mode can be selected by pulling the MODE/PLLIN pin to INT V\nCC. Burst \nMode operation offers the best efficiency at light load, but output ripple will be higher and lower frequency ranges are capable which can interfere with some systems. Pulse-skipping mode efficiency is not as good as Burst Mode operation, but this mode only skips pulses to save efficiency and maintains a lower output ripple and a higher switch -\ning frequency. Burst Mode operation and pulse-skipping mode efficiencies can be reviewed in graph supplied in the Typical Per\nformance Characteristics section.Fault Conditions: Current Limit and Overcurrent Foldback\nThe L TM4619 has a current mode controller , which inher -\nently limits the cycle-by-cycle inductor current not only in \nsteady-state operation, but also in transient.\nTo further limit current in the event of an overload condi -\ntion, the L\nTM4619 provides foldback current limiting. If the \noutput voltage falls by more than 50%, then the maximum \noutput current is progressively lowered to one-third of its full current limit value. Foldback current limiting is disabled during soft-start and tracking up.\nThermal Considerations and Output Current Derating\nThe thermal resistances reported in the Pin Configuration \nsection of the data sheet are consistent with those \nparam-\neters defined by JESD51-12 and are intended for use with finite element analysis (FEA) software modeling tools that leverage the outcome of thermal modeling, simulation, \nand correlation to hardware evaluation per\nformed on a \nµModule package mounted to a hardware test board. The motivation for providing these thermal coefficients is found in JESD51-12 (“Guidelines for Reporting and\n \nUsing Electronic Package Thermal Information”).\nMany designers may opt to use laboratory equipment \nand a test vehicle such as the demo board to predict the µModule regulator’s thermal performance in their appli -\ncation at various electrical and environmental operating conditions to compliment any FEA activities. Without FEA software, the thermal resistances reported in the Pin Con -\nfiguration section are, in and of themselves, not relevant to providing guidance of thermal per formance; instead, the \nderating cur\nves provided in this data sheet can be used \nin a manner that yields insight and guidance pertaining to one’s application-usage, and can be adapted to correlate thermal performance to one’s own application.\nThe Pin Configuration section gives four thermal coeffi -\ncients explicitly defined in JESD51-12; these coefficients \nare quoted or paraphrased in the following:\nLTM461915\n4619fc For more information www.linear .com/L TM4619applica Tions in ForMaTion\n1 θJA, the thermal resistance from junction to ambient, is \nthe natural convection junction-to-ambient air thermal \nresistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed enclo -\nsure. This environment is sometimes referred to as “still air” although natural convection causes the air to move. This value is determined with the part mounted to a 95mm ×\n 76mm PCB with four layers.\n2 θJCbottom , the thermal resistance from junction to the \nbottom of the product case, is determined with all of the component power dissipation flowing through the bottom of the package. In the typical µModule regulator , the bulk of the heat flows out the bottom of the pack -\nage, but there is always heat flow out into the ambient environment. As a result, this thermal resistance value may be useful for comparing packages but the test conditions don’t \ngenerally match the user’s application.\n3 θJCtop, the thermal resistance from junction to top of \nthe product case, is determined with nearly all of the component power dissipation flowing through the top of the package. As the electrical connections of the typical µModule regulator are on the bottom of the package, it is rare for an application to operate such that most of the heat flows from the junction to the top of the part.  As in the case of θ\nJCbottom , this value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n4\n θJB, the thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board, is the junction-to-board thermal resistance where almost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the µModule package and into the board, and is really the sum of the θ\nJCbottom  and the thermal resistance of \nthe bottom of the part through the solder joints and a portion of the board. The board temperature is measured a specified distance from the package.\nA graphical representation of the aforementioned ther -\nmal resistances is given in Figure 7; blue resistances are \ncontained within the µModule regulator , whereas green \nresistances are external to the µModule package.As \na practical matter , it should be clear to the reader that \nno individual or sub-group of the four thermal resistance parameters defined by JESD51-12 or provided in the Pin Configuration section replicates or conveys normal operating conditions of a µModule regulator . For example, in normal board-mounted applications, never does 100% of the device’s total power loss (heat) thermally con -\nduct exclusively through the top or exclusively through  \nbottom of the µModule package—as the standard defines \nfor θ\nJCtop and θ JCbottom , respectively. In practice, power \nloss is thermally dissipated in both directions away from \nthe package—granted, in the absence of a heat sink and airflow, a majority of the heat flow is into the board.\nWithin the L TM4619, be aware there are multiple power \ndevices and components dissipating power , with a con -\nsequence that the thermal resistances relative to different junctions of components or die are not exactly linear with respect to total package power loss. To reconcile this \ncomplication without sacrificing modeling simplicity—but\n \nalso not ignoring practical realities—an approach has been taken using FEA software modeling along with laboratory testing in a controlled-environment chamber to reason -\nably define and correlate the thermal resistance values supplied in \nthis data sheet: (1) Initially, FEA software is \nused to accurately build the mechanical geometry of the L TM4619 and the specified PCB with all of the correct material coefficients along with accurate power loss source definitions; (2) this model simulates a software-defined JEDEC environment consistent with JESD51-12 to predict power loss heat flow and temperature readings at different interfaces that enable the calculation of the JEDEC-defined thermal resistance values; (3) the model and FEA software is used to evaluate the L TM4619 with heat sink and airflow; (4) having solved for and analyzed these thermal resis -\ntance values and simulated various operating conditions in the software model, a thorough laboratory evaluation replicates \nthe simulated conditions with thermocouples \nwithin a controlled-environment chamber while operat -\ning the device at the same power loss as that which was simulated. The outcome of this process and due diligence yields the \nset of derating curves shown in this data sheet.\nLTM461916\n4619fc For more information www.linear .com/L TM4619applica Tions in ForMaTion\nFigure 7.

The power loss curves are taken at room temperature, and are increased with a 1.35 multiplicative factor at 120°C. The derating curves are plot -\nted with CH1 and CH2 in parallel single output operation starting at 8A of load with low ambient temperature. The  \noutput voltages are 1.5V and 3.3V\n. These are chosen to \ninclude the lower and higher output voltage ranges for cor -\nrelating the thermal resistance. Thermal models are derived from several temperature measurements in a controlled  \ntemperature chamber along with thermal modeling analysis.\n \nThe junction temperatures are monitored while ambient temperature is increased with and without airflow. The power loss increase with ambient temperature change is factored into the derating curves. The junctions are maintained at ~120°C maximum while lowering output current or power while increasing ambient temperature. The decreased output current will decrease the internal module loss as ambient temperature is increased. \nThe monitored junction temperature of 120°C minus \nthe ambient operating temperature specifies how much module temperature rise can be allowed. As an example in  \nFigure 12, the load current is derated to 5A at ~95°C with no air or heat sink and the power loss for the 12V to 1.5V  \nat 5A \noutput is about 1.83W . The 1.83W loss is calculated \nwith the 1.35W room temperature loss from the 12V to 1.5V power loss curve at 5A, and the 1.35 multiplying factor at 120°C ambient. If the 95°C ambient temperature is subtracted from the 120°C junction temperature, then the difference of 25°C divided by 1.83W equals a 13.6°C/W Θ\nJA thermal resistance. Table 2 specifies a 13.4°C/W value \nwhich is pretty close. The airflow graphs are more accurate due to the fact that the ambient temperature environment is controlled better with airflow. As an example in Figure 14, the load current is derated to 5A at ~95°C with 400LFM of airflow and the power loss for the 12V to 3.3V at 5A output is  ~2.5W . The 2.5W loss is calculated with the ~1.85W room temperature loss from the 12V to 3.3V power loss curve at 5A, and the 1.35 multiplying factor at 120°C ambient. If the 95°C ambient temperature is subtracted from the 120°C junction temperature, then the difference of 25°C divided by 2.5W equals a 10°C/W θ\nJA thermal resistance. Table 2 \nspecifies a 9.7°C/W value which is pretty close. Tables 2 and 3 provide equivalent thermal resistances for 1.5V and 3.3V outputs with and without airflow and heat sinking.\nThe derived thermal resistances in Tables 2 and 3 for the \nvarious conditions can be multiplied by the calculated power loss as a function of ambient temperature to derive temperature rise above ambient, thus maximum junction temperature. Room temperature power loss can be derived from the efficiency curves and adjusted with the above ambient temperature multiplicative factors.

There is no internal fuse. If required, \na slow blow fuse with a rating twice the maximum input current needs to be provided to protect each unit from catastrophic failure. \nLayout Checklist/Example\nThe high integration of L TM4619 makes the PCB board \nlayout very simple and easy. However , to optimize its electri -\ncal and thermal performance, some layout considerations are still necessar y\n.\n• Use large \nPCB copper areas for high current path, includ -\ning V IN, PGND, V OUT1 and V OUT2. It helps to minimize \nthe PCB conduction loss and thermal stress.• Place high \nfrequency ceramic input and output capaci-\ntors next to the V IN, PGND and V OUT pins to minimize \nhigh frequency noise.\n• Place a \ndedicated power ground layer underneath the \nunit.\n• To \nminimize the via conduction loss and reduce module \nthermal stress, use multiple vias for interconnections between top layer and other power layers.\n•\n Do not put vias directly on the pads.\n• Use a \nseparated SGND ground copper area for com -\nponents connected to signal pins. Connect the SGND to PGND underneath the unit. \n•\n Decouple the \ninput and output grounds to lower the \noutput ripple noise.\nFigure 18 gives a good example of the recommended layout. \nLTM461920\n4619fc For more information www.linear .com/L TM4619Typical applica Tions\nFigure 19.
