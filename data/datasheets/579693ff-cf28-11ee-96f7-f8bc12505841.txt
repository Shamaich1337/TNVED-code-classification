E –5–AD7814\nCIRCUIT INFORMATION\nThe AD7814 is a 10-bit digital temperature sensor. The part\nhouses an on-chip temperature sensor, a 10-bit A/D converter,\na reference, and serial interface logic functions in a SOT-23\npackage. The A/D converter section consists of a conventionalsuccessive-approximation co nverter based around a capacitor\nDAC. The parts are capable of running on a 2.7 V to 5.5 V\npower supply.\nThe on-chip temperature sensor allows an accurate measurement\nof the ambi ent device tem perature to be made. The working\nmeasurement range of the AD7814 is –55 °C to +125 °C.\nCONVERTER DETAILS\nThe conversion clock for the part is internally generated so no\nexternal clock is required except when reading from and writingto the serial port. In normal mode, an internal clock oscillator\nruns the automatic conversion sequence. A conversion is initi-\nated approximately every 350 µs. At this time, the part wakes up\nand performs a temperature conversion. This temperature con-\nversion typically takes 25 µs, at which time the part automati-\ncally shuts down. The result of the most recent temperatureconversion is available in the serial output register at any time.\nOnce the conversion is finished, an internal oscillator starts\ncounting and is designed to time out every 350 µs. The AD7814\nthen powers up and does a conversion. Please note that if the\nCS is brought low every 350 µs (±30%), then the same tempera-\nture value will be output onto the DOUT line every time with-out changing. It is recommended that the CS line is not brought\nlow every 350 µs (±30%). The ±30% covers process variation.\nThe CS should become active (high to low) outside this range.\nThe device is designed to autoconvert every 350 µs. If the\nAD7814 is accessed during the conversion process, an internalsignal is generated to prevent any update of the temperature\nvalue register during the conversion. Otherwise the user could\nread back spurious data. The design of this feature results in thisinternal lockout signal being reset only at the start of the next\nautoconversion. Therefore, if the CS line goes active before the\ninternal lockout signal has been reset to its inactive mode, theinternal lockout signal will not be reset. To ensure that no lock-\nout signal is set, bring the CS low at a greater or less time than\n350 µs (±30%). This will mean that the AD7814 is not inter-\nrupted during a conversion process. The AD7814 can be placed\nin a shutdown mode, via the control register, in which case the\non-chip oscillator is shut down and no further conversions areinitiated until the AD7814 is taken out of shutdown mode. The\nconversion result from the last conversion prior to shutdown can\nstill be read from the AD7814 even when it is in shutdown mode.\nIn the automatic conversion mode, every time a read or write\noperation takes place, the internal clock oscillator is restarted at\nthe end of the read or write operation. The result of the con-\nversion is typically available 25 µs later. Similarly, when the\npart is taken out of shutdown mode, the internal clock oscil-\nlator is restarted and the conversion result is typically available25µs later. Reading from the device before conversion is com-\nplete will provide the same set of data.\nTEMPERATURE VALUE REGISTER\nThe temperature value register is a read-only register that storesthe temperature reading from the ADC in 10-bit twos comple-\nment format. The temperature data format is shown in Table I.\nThis shows the full theoretical range of the ADC from –128 °C\nto +127 °C, but in practice the temperature measurement range\nis limited to the operating temperature range of the device (–55 °C\nto +125 °C). A typical performance curve is shown in Figure 7.\nTable I. Temperature Data Format\nDigital Output\nTemperature DB9 . . .

The interface can be operated in\n3-wire m ode with DIN tied to Ground, in which case the inter-\nface has read-only capability, with data being read from the data\nregister via the DOUT line. The DIN line is used to write the partinto standby mode, if required. The CS line is used to select the\ndevice when more than one device is connected to the serial\nclock and data lines.\nThe part operates in a slave mode and requires an externally\napplied serial clock to the SCLK input to access data from the\ndata register. The serial interface on the AD7814 is designed to\nallow the part to be interfaced to systems that provide a serialclock that is synchronized to the serial data, such as the 80C51,\n87C51, 68HC11, 68HC05, and PIC16Cxx microcontrollers, as\nwell as DSP processors.\nA read operation from the AD7814 accesses data from the\ntemperature value register, while a write op eration to the part\nwrites data to the control register.\nREV. EAD7814\n–6–Read Operation\nFigure 2 shows the timing diagram for a serial read from the\nAD7814. The CS line enables the SCLK input. Ten bits of data\nand a leading zero are transferred during a read operation. Read\noperations occur during streams of 16 clock pulses. The serialdata is accessed in a number of bytes if 10 bits of data are being\nread. At the end of the read operation, the DOUT line remains\nin the state of the last bit of data clocked out of the AD7814until CS returns high, at which time the DOUT line goes into\nthree-state.\nWrite Operation\nFigure 2 also shows the timing diagram for a serial write to the\nAD7814. The write operation takes place at the same time as\nthe read operation. Data is clocked into the control register on\nthe part on the rising edge of SCLK. Only the third bit in thedata stream provides a user-controlled function. This third bit isthe power-down bit which, when set to a 1, puts the AD7814\ninto shutdown mode. The first 2 bits of the data stream are\n“don’t cares” while all other bits in the data stream, other thanthe power-down bit, should be 0 to ensure correct operation of\nthe AD7814. Data is loaded to the control register on the fif-\nteenth falling SCLK edge and the data takes effect at this time(i.e., if the part is programmed to go into shutdown, it does so\nat this point). If the CS is brought high before this fifteenth SCLK\nedge, the control register will not be loaded and the power-down\nstatus of the part will not change.\nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING\nThe AD7814’s serial interface allows for easy interface to most\nmicrocomputers and microprocessors. Figures 3 through 6 show\nsome typical interface circuits.\nThe serial interface on the AD7814 consists of four wires: CS,\nDIN, DOUT, and SCLK. All interface circuits shown utilize all\nfour interface lines. However, it is possible to operate the inter-\nface with three wires. If the application does not require thepower-down facility offered by the AD7814, the DIN line can\nbe tied permanently low. Thus, the interface can be operated\nfrom just three wires: SCLK, CS, and DOUT.\nThe serial data transfer to and from the AD7814 requires a\n16-bit read operation. Many 8-bit microcontrollers have 8-bit\nserial ports and this 16-bit data transfer is handled as two 8-bit\ntransfers. Other microcontrollers and DSP processors transfer16 bits of data in a serial data operation.CS\nSCLK\nDOUT\nDINDON'T\nCAREDON'T\nCAREPOWER-\nDOWNLEADING\nZERODB9 DB8 DB01 234 1 1 15 16t1t2\nt3t4\nt5t6t7\nt8\nFigure 2.

The MC68HC11 is configured in\nthe master mode with its CPOL bit set to a logic one and its\nCPHA bit set to a logic one.

AD7814 to MC68HC11 Interface\nAD7814 to 8051 Interface\nAn interface circuit between the AD7814 and the 8051 micro-\ncontroller is shown in Figure 4. The 8xC51 is configured in its\nMode 0 serial interface mode. The serial clock line of the 8xC51(on P3.1) idles high between data transfers. Data is trans ferred\nto and from the AD7814 in two 8-bit serial data operations. The\nAD7814 outputs the MSB of its data stream as the first validbit while the 8xC51 expects the LSB first. Thus, the data read\ninto the serial buffer needs to be rearranged before the correct\ndata word from the AD7814 is available in the accumulator.\nIn the example shown, the AD7814 is connected to the serial\nport of the 8051. Because the serial interface of the 8xC51 con-\ntains only one data line, the DIN line of the AD7814 is tied low\nin the interface example given in Figure 4.\nFor applications that require the use of the power-down feature\nof the AD7814, the serial interface should be implemented\nusing data port lines on the 8051. This allows a full-duplex\nserial interface to be implemented. The method involves ‘bit-banging’ a port line to generate a serial clock while using two\nother port lines to shift data in and out with the fourth port line\nconnecting to CS. Port lines 1.0 through 1.3 (with P1.1 config-\nured as an input) can be used to connect to SCLK, DOUT,\nDIN, and CS, respectively, to implement this scheme.\nREV.

AD7814 to ADSP-21xx Interface\nMOUNTING THE AD7814\nThe AD7814 can be used for surface or air temperature sensing\napplications. If the device is cemented to a surface with ther-\nmally conductive adhesive, the die temperature will be withinabout 0.1 °C of the surface temperature, thanks to the device’s\nlow power consumption. Care should be taken to insulate the\nback and leads of the device from the air, if the ambient airtemperature is different from the surface temperature being\nmeasured.\nThe ground pin provides the best thermal path to the die, so the\ntemperature of the die will be close to that of the printed circuitground track. Care should be taken to ensure that this is in good\nthermal contact with the surface being measured.\nAs with any IC, the AD7814 and its associated wiring and cir-\ncuits must be kept free from moisture to prevent leakage andcorrosion, particularly in cold conditions where condensation is\nmore likely to occur. Water-resistant varnishes and conformal\ncoatings can be used for protection. The small size of the\nAD7814 package allows it to be mounted inside sealed metalprobes, which provide a safe environment for the device.\nSUPPLY DECOUPLING\nThe AD7814 should be decoupled with a 0.1 µF ceramic\ncapacitor between V DD and GND. This is particularly important\nif the AD7814 is mounted remotely from the power supply.\nTEMPERATURE – /H11543C–0.4\n–55TEMPERATURE ERROR\n–0.200.20.40.60.81.0\n–40 0 25 40 85 100 120Figure 7.
