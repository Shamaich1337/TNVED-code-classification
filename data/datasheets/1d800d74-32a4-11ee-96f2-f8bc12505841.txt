Normal Status \nWhen t he voltage of each of the batteries  is in the range from V DLn to V CUn and the discharge current is \nlower than the specified value (the VINI pin voltage is lower than V IOV1 and V IOV2, and the VMP pin voltage \nis higher than V IOV3), the charging and dischar ging FETs are turned on. \n \n2.  Overcharge Status \nWhen t he voltage of one of the batteries  becomes higher than V CUn and the state continues for t CU or \nlonger, the COP pin becomes high impedance. The COP pin is pulled up to the EB + pin voltage by an \nexternal resistor, and the charging FET is turned o ff to stop charging.  This is called the overcharge \nstatus.  The overcharge status is released when one of the following two conditions holds. \n(1) T he voltage of each of the batteries  becomes V CLn or lower. \n(2) T he voltage of each of the batteries  is V CUn or lower, and the VMP pin voltage is 39 / 40 × VDD or \nlower (a load is connected and discharging is st arted via the body diode of the charging FET). \n \n3.  Overdischarge Status \nWhen t he voltage of one of the batteries  becomes lower than V DLn and the state continues for t DL or \nlonger, the DOP pin voltage becomes V DD level, and the discharging FET is turned off to stop discharging.  \nThis is called the overdischarging status.  After di scharging is stopped due to the overdischarge status, \nthe S-8254A Series enters the power-down status. \n \n4.  Power-down Status \nWhen discharging has stopped due to the overdischa rge status, the VMP pin is pulled down to the V SS \nlevel by the R VMS resistor.  When the VMP pin voltage is lower than V DD / 2, the S-8254A Series enters \nthe power-down status.  In the power -down status, almost all the circui ts of the S-8254A Series stop and \nthe current consumption is I PDN or lower.  The conditions of each output pin are as follows. \n(1)  COP pin : High-Z (2)  DOP pin : V\nDD \n \nThe power-down status is released when the following condition holds. \n(1)  The VMP pin voltage is V DD / 2 or higher. \n \nThe following two conditions release the overdischarging status. \n(1)  In case the VMP pin voltage is V DD / 2 or higher and the VMP pin voltage is lower than V DD, the \noverdischarging status is released when t he voltage of each of the batteries  is V DUn or higher. \n(2)  In case a charger is connected, the overdischa rge hysteresis is releas ed. And the overdischarging \nstatus is released when t he voltage of each of the batteries  is V DLn or higher. \n BATTERY PROTECTION IC FOR 3- SERIAL- OR 4-SERIAL-CELL PACK\nRev.5.1 _02 S-8254A Series\n \n 15 \n5.  Overcurrent Status \nThe S-8254A Series has three overcurrent detection levels (V IOV1, VIOV2, and V IOV3) and three overcurrent \ndetection delay times (t IOV1, tIOV2, and t IOV3) corresponding to each overcurr ent detection level.  When the \ndischarging current becomes higher than  the specified value (the voltage between V SS and V INI is greater \nthan V IOV1) and the state continues for t IOV1 or longer, the S-8254A Series enters the overcurrent status, in \nwhich the DOP pin voltage becomes V DD level to turn off the discharging FET to stop discharging, the \nCOP pin becomes high impedance and is pulled up to the EB + pin voltage to turn off the charging FET to \nstop charging, and the VMP pin is pulled up to the V DD voltage by the internal resistor (R VMD).  Operation \nof overcurrent detection level 2 (V IOV2) and overcurrent detecti on delay time 2 (t IOV2) is the same as for \nVIOV1 and t IOV1. \nIn the overcurrent status, the VMP pin is pulled up to the V DD level by the internal resistor in the IC (R VMD \nresistor).  The overcurrent status is released when the following condition holds. \n(1)  The VMP pin voltage is V IOV3 or higher because a charger is connected or the load (30 M Ω or \nmore) is released. \n \n6.  0 V Battery Charge Function \nRegarding the charging of a self-discharged battery (0  V battery), the S-8254A Series has two functions \nfrom which one should be selected. \n(1)  0 V battery charging is allowed (0 V battery charging is available.) \nWhen the charger voltage is higher than V 0CHA, the 0 V battery can be charged. \n(2)  0 V battery charging is prohibited (0 V battery charging is unavailable.) \nWhen the battery voltage is V 0INH or lower, the 0 V battery cannot be charged. \n \nCaution  When the VDD pin voltage is lower than the minimum value of V DSOP, the operation of the \nS-8254A Series is not guaranteed.  \n \n7.  Delay Time Setting \nThe overcharge detection delay time (t CU) is determined by the external capacitor connected to the CCT \npin.  The overdischarge detection delay time (t DL) and overcurrent detection delay time 1 (t IOV1) are \ndetermined by the external capacitor connected to the CDT pin.  Overcurrent detection delay times 2 and \n3 (t IOV2, tIOV3) are fixed internally. \n \n min. typ. max. \ntCU [s] = (5.00,  10.0,  15.0) × CCCT [μF] \ntDL [s] = (0.50,  1.00,  1.50) × CCDT [μF] \ntIOV1 [s] = (0.05,  0.10,  0.15) × CCDT [μF] \n \n8.  CTL Pin \nThe S-8254A Series has control pins.  The CTL pin is used to control the COP and DOP pin output \nvoltages.  CTL pin takes precedence over the battery protection circuit.   \n \nTable 5  Conditions Set by CTL Pin \nCTL Pin COP Pin DOP Pin \nHigh High-Z V DD \nOpen High-Z V DD \nLow Normal status *1 Normal status *1 \n*1.  The status is controlled by the voltage detector. \n \nCaution  Please note unexpected behavior might occur when electrical potential difference \nbetween the CTL pin (‘L’ level) and VSS is  generated through the external filter \n(RVSS and C VSS) as a result of input voltage fluctuations. \n \nBATTERY PROTECTION IC FOR 3- SERIAL- OR 4-SERIAL-CELL PACK \nS-8254A Series Rev.5.1 _02\n \n 16 \n9.  SEL pin \nThe S-8254A Series has control pins.  The SEL pin is used to switch between 3-cell and 4-cell protection.  \nWhen the SEL pin is low, overdischarge detection of the V4 cell is prohibited and an overdischarge is not \ndetected even if the V4 cell is shorted, therefore, the V4 cell can be used for 3-cell protection.  The SEL \npin takes precedence over the battery protecti on circuit.
