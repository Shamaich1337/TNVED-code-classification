They are\ndesigned to support unlimited true back-to-back read/writeoperations with no wait states. The\nCY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33/CY7C1462KVE33 devices\nare equipped with the advanced (NoBL) logic required to enableconsecutive read/write operations  with data being transferred o n\nevery clock cycle. \nThis feature dramatically imp roves the throughput of data in\nsystems that require frequent write and read transitions. TheCY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33/CY7C1462KVE33 devices\nare pin-compatible and functionally equivalent to ZBT devices.\nAll synchronous inputs pass through input registers controlled by\nthe rising edge of the clock. All data outputs pass through out put\nregisters controlled by the rising edge of the clock. The clock\ninput is qualified by the clock enable (CEN\n) signal, which when\ndeasserted suspends operation and extends the previous clockcycle. \nWrite operations are controlled by the byte write selects\n(BW\na–BWd for CY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33 and\nBWa–BWb for CY7C1462KVE33) and a write enable (WE ) input.\nAll writes are conducted with on-chip synchronous self-timed\nwrite circuitry.\nThree synchronous chip enables (CE1, CE2, and CE3) and an\nasynchronous output enable (OE ) enable easy bank selection\nand output tristate control.

The clock signal is qualified wit h the\nclock enable input signal (CEN ). If CEN  is HIGH, the clock signal\nis not recognized and all internal states are maintained. Allsynchronous operations are qualified with CEN\n. All data outputs\npass through output registers controlled by the rising edge of the\nclock. Maximum access dela y from the clock rise (tCO) is 2.5 ns\n(250-MHz device).\nAccesses can be initiated by asserting all three chip enables\n(CE1, CE2, and CE3) active at the rising edge of the clock. If clock\nenable (CEN ) is active LOW and ADV/LD  is asserted LOW, the\naddress presented to the device is latched. The access caneither be a read or write operation, depending on the status of\nthe write enable (WE\n). BW[x] can be used to conduct byte write\noperations. \nWrite operations are qualified by the write enable (WE ). All writes\nare simplified with on-chip synchronous self timed write circui try. \nThree synchronous chip enables (CE1, CE2, and CE3) and an\nasynchronous output enable (OE ) simplify depth expansion. All\noperations (reads, writes, and de selects) are pipelined. ADV/LD\nshould be driven LOW after the device has been deselected to\nload a new address fo r the next operation.\nSingle Read Accesses\nA read access is initiated when the following conditions are\nsatisfied at  clock rise: \n■CEN  is asserted LOW\n■CE1, CE2, and CE3 are all asserted active■The write enable input signal WE  is deasserted HIGH\n■ADV/LD  is asserted LOW\nThe address presented to the address inputs is latched into the\naddress register and presented to the memory core and controllogic. The control logic determines that a read access is inprogress and allows the requested data to propagate to the inpu t\nof the output register. At the rising edge of the next clock, t he\nrequested data is allowed to propagate through the outputregister and on to the data bus within 2.5 ns (250-MHz device)provided OE\n is active LOW. After the first clock of the read\naccess, the output buffers are controlled by OE  and the internal\ncontrol logic. OE  must be driven LOW for the device to drive out\nthe requested data. During the second clock, a subsequentoperation (read/write/ deselect) can be initiated. Deselecting t he\ndevice is also pipelined. Therefore, when the SRAM isdeselected at clock rise by one o f the chip enable signals, its\noutput tristates following the next clock rise.\nBurst Read Accesses\nThe CY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33/CY7C1462KVE33 havean on-chip burst counter that enables the user the ability tosupply a single address and conduct up to four reads withoutreasserting the address inputs. ADV/LD\n must be driven LOW to\nload a new address into the SRAM, as described in the Single\nRead Accesses  section earlier. The sequence of the burst\ncounter is determined by the MODE input signal. A LOW inputon MODE selects a linear burst mode, a HIGH selects aninterleaved burst sequence. Both  burst counters use A0 and A1\nin the burst sequence, and wrap around when incrementedsufficiently. A HIGH input on ADV/LD\n increments the internal\nburst counter regardless of the state of chip enables inputs orWE\n. WE  is latched at the beginning of a burst cycle. Therefore,\nthe type of access (read or write) is maintained throughout theburst sequence.V\nDD Power supply Power supply inputs to the core of the device .\nVDDQ I/O power supply Power supply for the I/O circuitry . \nVSS Ground Ground for the device .

In addition, the address for\nthe subsequent access (read/writ e/deselect) is latched into the\naddress register (provided the appropriate control signals are\nasserted).\nOn the next clock rise, the data presented to DQ and DQP\n(DQa,b,c,d /DQPa,b,c,d  for CY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33 and\nDQa,b/DQPa,b for CY7C1462KVE33), or a subset for byte write\noperations, see the Write Cycle Description table for details)\ninputs is latched into the device and the write is complete. \nThe data written during the write operation is controlled by th e\nBW (BWa,b,c,d  for CY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33 and BWa,b\nfor CY7C1462KVE33) signals. TheCY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33/CY7C1462KVE33 providesbyte-write capability that is described in the Write CycleDescription table. Asserting the write enable input (WE\n) with the\nselected byte write select (BW ) input selectively writes to only the\ndesired bytes. Bytes not selected during a byte write operationremains unaltered. A synchronous self timed write mechanismhas been provided to simplify the write operations. Byte writecapability has been included to simplify read/modify/writesequences, which can be reduced to simple byte write opera-tions. \nBecause the CY7C14 60KV33/ CY7C1460KVE33/\nCY7C1462KVE33 devices are common I/O devices, data shouldnot be driven into the device while the outputs are active. The\noutput enable (OE\n) can be deasserted HIGH before presenting\ndata to the DQ and DQP (DQa,b,c,d /DQPa,b,c,d  f o r\nCY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33 and DQa,b/DQPa,b f o r\nCY7C1462KVE33) inputs. Doing so tristates the output drivers.\nAs a safety precaution, DQ and DQP (DQa,b,c,d /DQPa,b,c,d  forCY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33 and DQa,b/DQPa,b f o r\nCY7C1462KVE33) are automatical ly tristated during the data\nportion of a write  cycle, regardless of  the state of OE . \nBurst Write Accesses\nThe CY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33/CY7C1462KVE33\ndevices have an on-chip burst counter that allows the user theability to supply a single address and conduct up to four WRITEoperations without reassertin g the address inputs. ADV/LD\n must\nbe driven LOW to load the initial address, as described in theSingle Write Accesses  section. When ADV/LD\n is driven HIGH on\nthe subsequent clock rise, the chip enables (CE1, CE2, and CE3)\nand WE  inputs are ignored and the burst counter is incremented.\nThe correct BW  inputs (BWa,b,c,d  f o r\nCY7C1460KV33/CY7C1460KVE33 and BWa,b f o r\nCY7C1462KVE33) must be driven in each cycle of the burst writeto write the correct  bytes of data. \nSleep Mode\nThe ZZ input pin is an asynchrono us input. Asserting ZZ places\nthe SRAM in a power conservation “sleep” mode. Two clock\ncycles are required to enter into or exit from this “sleep” mod e.\nWhile in this mode, data integr ity is guaranteed. Accesses\npending when entering the “sle ep” mode are not considered valid\nnor is the completion of the operation guaranteed. The devicemust be deselected prior to entering the “sleep” mode. CE\n1, CE2,\nand CE3, must remain inactive for the duration of tZZREC after the\nZZ input returns LOW.\nOn-Chip ECC\nCY7C1460KVE33/CY7C1462KVE33 SRAMs include an on-chipECC algorithm that detects and corrects all single-bit memory\nerrors, including Soft Error Upset (SEU) events induced by\ncosmic rays, alpha particles, and  so on. The resulting Soft Err or\nRate (SER) of these devices is ant icipated to be <0.01 FITs/Mb,\na 4-order-of-magnitude improvement over comparable SRAMs\nwith no on-chip ECC, which typically have an SER of 200FITs/Mb or more.To protect the internal data, ECC parity bits\n(invisible to the user) are used.\nThe ECC algorithm does not correct multi-bit errors. However,\nCypress SRAMs are designed in such a way that a single SER\nevent has a very low probability of causing a multi-bit erroracross any data word. The extreme rarity of multi-bit errors\nresults in a SER of <0.01 FITs/Mb.\nDocument Number: 001-66680 Rev. *L Page 10 of 31CY7C1460KV33\nCY7C1460KVE33CY7C1462KVE33\nInterleaved Burst Address Table\n(MODE = Floating or VDD)\nFirst \nAddress\nA1, A0Second \nAddress\nA1, A0Third \nAddress\nA1, A0Fourth \nAddress\nA1, A0\n00 01 10 1101 00 11 10\n10 11 00 01\n11 10 01 00Linear Burst Address Table\n(MODE = GND)\nFirst \nAddress\nA1, A0Second \nAddress\nA1, A0Third \nAddress\nA1, A0Fourth \nAddress\nA1, A0\n00 01 10 1101 10 11 00\n10 11 00 01\n11 00 01 10\nZZ Mode Electrical Characteristics\nParameter Description Test Conditions Min Max Unit\nIDDZZ Sleep mode standby current ZZ \uf03e VDD\uf020\uf02d 0.2 V – 75 mA\ntZZS Device operation to ZZ ZZ \uf020\uf03e\uf020VDD \uf02d 0.2 V – 2tCYC ns\ntZZREC ZZ recovery time ZZ \uf03c 0.2 V 2tCYC –n s\ntZZI ZZ active to sleep current Th is parameter is sampled – 2tCYC ns\ntRZZI ZZ inactive to exit sleep current This parameter is sampled 0 – ns\nDocument Number: 001-66680 Rev. *L Page 11 of 31CY7C1460KV33\nCY7C1460KVE33CY7C1462KVE33\nTruth Table\nThe Truth Table for CY7C1460KV3 3/CY7C1460KVE33/CY7C1462KVE33 fo llows.

This part is fully compliant with 1149.1. Th e\nTAP operates using JEDEC-standard 3.3-V or 2.5-V I/O logiclevel.\nThe CY7C1460KVE33 contains a TAP controller, instruction\nregister, boundary scan register, bypass register, and ID regis ter.\nDisabling the JTAG Feature\nIt is possible to operate the SRAM without using the JTAG\nfeature. To disable the TAP co ntroller, TCK must be tied LOW\n(VSS) to prevent clocking of the device. TDI and TMS are pulled\nup internally and may be unconnec ted. They may alternately be\nconnected to VDD through a pull-up resistor. TDO should be left\nunconnected. Upon power-up, the device enters a reset state,\nwhich does not interfere with t he operation of the device. \nTest Access Port (TAP)\nTest Clock (TCK)\nThe test clock is used only with the TAP controller. All inputs  are\ncaptured on the rising edge of TCK. All outputs are driven from\nthe falling edge of TCK.\nTest Mode Select (TMS)\nThe TMS input is used to give commands to the TAP controller\nand is sampled on the rising edge of TCK. It is allowable to le ave\nthis ball unconnected if the TAP is not used. The ball is pulle d up\ninternally, resulting in a logic HIGH level.\nTest Data-In (TDI)\nThe TDI ball is used to serially input information into the reg isters\nand can be connected to the input  of any of the registers. The\nregister between TDI and TDO is  chosen by the instruction that\nis loaded into the TAP instruction register. TDI is pulled upinternally and can be unconnected if the TAP is unused in an\napplication. TDI is connected to the most significant bit (MSB)  of\nany register (see TAP Controller Block Diagram ).\nTest Data-Out (TDO)\nThe TDO output ball is used to serially clock data-out from the\nregisters. The output is activ e depending upon the current stat e\nof the TAP state machine. The output changes on the falling edg e\nof TCK. TDO is connected to the least significant bit (LSB) of any\nregister (see TAP Controller State Diagram ). \nPerforming a TAP Reset\nA RESET is performed by forcing TMS HIGH (VDD) for five rising\nedges of TCK. This RESET does not affect the operation of the\nSRAM and may be performed while the SRAM is operating.\nAt power-up, the TAP is reset internally to ensure that TDO\ncomes up in a high-Z state.TAP Registers\nRegisters are connected betw een the TDI and TDO balls and\nallow data to be scanned into and out of the SRAM test circuitr y.\nOnly one register can be selected at a time through theinstruction register. Data is serially loaded into the TDI ball  on the\nrising edge of TCK. Data is output on the TDO ball on the falli ng\nedge of TCK.\nInstruction Register\nThree-bit instructions can be serially loaded into the instruct ion\nregister. This register is loaded when it is placed between the  TDI\nand TDO balls as shown in the TAP Controller Block Diagram .\nUpon power-up, the instruction register is loaded with the\nIDCODE instruction. It is also loaded with the IDCODE\ninstruction if the controller is placed in a reset state as des cribed\nin the previ ous section.\nWhen the TAP controller is in the Capture-IR state, the two lea st\nsignificant bits are loaded with a binary “01” pattern to enabl e\nfault isolation of the board-l evel serial test data path.\nBypass Register\nTo save time when serially shifting data through registers, it is\nsometimes advantageous to skip certain chips. The bypass\nregister is a single-bit register that can be placed between th e\nTDI and TDO balls. This allows data to be shifted through the\nSRAM with minimal delay. The bypass register is set LOW (V\nSS)\nwhen the BYPASS instruction is executed.\nBoundary Scan Register\nThe boundary scan register is connected to all the input and\nbidirectional balls on the SRAM. The length of the boundary sca n\nregister for the SRAM in differen t packages is listed in the Sc an\nRegister Sizes table.\nThe boundary scan register is loaded with the contents of the\nRAM I/O ring when the TAP contro ller is in the Capture-DR state\nand is then placed between the TDI and TDO balls when thecontroller is moved to the Shift-DR state. The EXTEST,\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD and SAMPLE Z instructions can be used to\ncapture the content s of the I/O ring.\nThe Boundary Scan Order on page 19  and show the order in\nwhich the bits are connected. Each bit corresponds to one of th e\nbumps on the SRAM package. The MSB of the register is\nconnected to TDI,  and the LSB is connected to TDO.\nIdentification (ID) Register\nThe ID register is loaded with a vendor-specific, 32-bit code\nduring the Capture-DR state when the IDCODE command is\nloaded in the instruction register. The IDCODE is hardwired int o\nthe SRAM and can be shifted out when the TAP controller is in\nthe Shift-DR state. The ID regi ster has a vendor  code and other\ninformation described in the Identification Regist er Definitions on\npage 18 .\nDocument Number: 001-66680 Rev. *L Page 14 of 31CY7C1460KV33\nCY7C1460KVE33CY7C1462KVE33\nTAP Instruction Set\nOverview\nEight different instructions are possible with the three-bit\ninstruction register. All combinations are listed in the Instru ction\nCodes table. Three of these instructions are listed asRESERVED and should not be used.  The other five instructions\ndescribed in detail are as follows.\nInstructions are loaded into the TAP controller during the Shif t-IR\nstate when the instruction register is placed between TDI and\nTDO. During this state, instructions are shifted through the\ninstruction register through the TDI and TDO balls. To executethe instruction after it is shif ted in, the TAP controller need s to be\nmoved into the Update-IR state.\nIDCODE\nThe IDCODE instruction causes a  vendor-specific, 32-bit code\nto be loaded into the instruction register. It also places the\ninstruction register between the TDI and TDO balls and allowsthe IDCODE to be shifted out  of the device when the TAP\ncontroller enters the Shift-DR state.\nThe IDCODE instruction is loaded into the instruction register\nupon power-up or whenever the TAP controller is given a test\nlogic reset state.\nSAMPLE Z\nThe SAMPLE Z instruction causes the boundary scan register to\nbe connected between the TDI and TDO pins when the TAPcontroller is in a Shift-DR state. The SAMPLE Z command puts\nthe output bus into a high-Z stat e until the next command is gi ven\nduring the “Update IR” state.\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD\nSAMPLE/PRELOAD is a 1149.1  mandatory instruction. When\nthe SAMPLE/PRELOAD instruct ions are loaded into the\ninstruction register and the TAP controller is in the Capture-D R\nstate, a snapshot of data on the input and output pins is captu red\nin the boundary scan register. \nThe user must be aware that the TAP controller clock can only\noperate at a frequency up to 20 MHz, while the SRAM clockoperates more than an order of m agnitude faster. Because there\nis a large difference in the clock frequencies, it is possible that\nduring the Capture-DR state, an input or output undergoes atransition. The TAP may then try to capture a signal while in\ntransition (metastable state). This does not harm the device, b ut\nthere is no guarantee as to th e value that is captured.\nRepeatable results may not be possible.\nTo guarantee that the boundar y scan register captures the\ncorrect value of a signal, the SRAM signal must be stabilized\nlong enough to meet the TAP controller’s capture setup plus hol d\ntimes (t\nCS and tCH). The SRAM clock input  might not be captured\ncorrectly if there is no way in a design to stop (or slow) the clock\nduring a SAMPLE/PRELOAD instruct ion. If this is an issue, it is\nstill possible to capture all other signals and simply ignore t he\nvalue of the clock captured in  the boundary scan register.After the data is captured, it is possible to shift out the dat a by\nputting the TAP into the Shift-DR state. This places the bounda ry\nscan register between  the TDI and TDO pins.\nPRELOAD allows an initial data pattern to be placed at the\nlatched parallel outputs of the boundary scan register cells pr ior\nto the selection of another boundary scan test operation.\nThe shifting of data for the SAMPLE and PRELOAD phases can\noccur concurrently when required – that is, while data capturedis shifted out, the preloaded data can be shifted in.\nBYPASS\nWhen the BYPASS instruction is loaded in the instruction regist er\nand the TAP is placed in a Shift -DR state, the b ypass register is\nplaced between the TDI and TDO pins. The advantage of the\nBYPASS instruction is that it shortens the boundary scan pathwhen multiple devices a re connected on a board.\nEXTEST\nThe EXTEST instruction enables the preloaded data to be driven\nout through the system output pi ns. This instruction also selec ts\nthe boundary scan register to be connected for serial access\nbetween the TDI and TDO in th e shift-DR controller state.\nEXTEST OUTPUT BUS TRISTATE\nIEEE Standard 1149.1 mandates that  the TAP controller must be\nable to put the output bus  into a tristate mode. \nThe boundary scan register has a  special bit located at bit #89\n(for the 165-ball FBGA package). When this scan cell, called th e\n“extest output bus tristate,” is  latched into the preload regis ter\nduring the “Update-DR” state in the TAP controller, it directly\ncontrols the state of the output (Q-bus) pins, when the EXTESTis entered as the current instr uction. When HIGH, it enables th e\noutput buffers to drive the outp ut bus. When LOW, this bit plac es\nthe output bus in a high-Z condition. \nThis bit can be set by ent ering the SAMPLE/PRELOAD or\nEXTEST command, and then shifting the desired bit into that cel l,\nduring the “Shift-DR” state. During “Update-DR,” the value\nloaded into that shift-register cell latches into the preload\nregister. When the EXTEST instruction is entered, this bit dire ctly\ncontrols the output Q-bus pins. Note that this bit is preset HI GH\nto enable the output when the device is powered-up, and also\nwhen the TAP controller is in t he “Test-Logic-R eset” state. \nReserved\nThese instructions are not imp lemented but are reserved for\nfuture use. Do not use  these instructions.\nDocument Number: 001-66680 Rev. *L Page 15 of 31CY7C1460KV33\nCY7C1460KVE33CY7C1462KVE33\nTAP Controller State Diagram\nThe 0/1 next to each state represents the value of TMS at the\nrising edge of TCK.
