General description\nThe PCA9634 is an I2C-bus controlled 8-bit LED driver optimized for \nRed/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color mixing applications. Each LED output has its own \n8-bit resolution (256 steps) fixed frequen cy Individual PWM controller that operates at \n97 kHz with a duty cycle that is adjustable fr om 0 % to 99.6 % to a llow the LED to be set \nto a specific brightness value. An additi onal 8-bit resolution (256 steps) Group PWM \ncontroller has both a fixed frequency of 190 Hz and an adjustable frequency between \n24 Hz to once every 10.73 seconds with a duty cycle that is adjustable from 0 % to 99.6 % \nthat is used to either dim or blink all LEDs with the same value.\nEach LED output can be off, on (no PWM control), set at its Individual PWM controller \nvalue or at both Individual and Group PWM controller values. The LED output driver is \nprogrammed to be either op en-drain with a 25 mA current sink capability at 5 V or \ntotem-pole with a 25 mA sink, 10 mA source ca pability at 5 V. The PCA9634 operates with \na supply voltage range of 2.3 V to 5.5 V and the outputs are 5.5 V tolerant. LEDs can be directly connected to the LED output (up to 25 mA, 5.5 V) or controlled with external \ndrivers and a minimum amount of discrete com ponents for larger current or higher voltage \nLEDs.\nThe PCA9634 is one of the first LED contro ller devices in a new Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) \nfamily. Fm+ devices offer higher frequency (up to 1 MHz) and more densely populated \nbus operation (up to 4000 pF).\nThe active LOW Output Enable input pin (OE\n) allows asynchronous control of the LED \noutputs and can be used to set all the outputs to a defined I2C-bus programmable logic \nstate. The OE  can also be used to externally PWM the outputs, which is useful when \nmultiple devices need to be dimmed or blinked together using software control.\nSoftware programmable LED Group and three Sub Call I2C-bus addresses allow all or \ndefined groups of PCA9634 devices to respond to a common I2C-bus address, allowing \nfor example, all red LEDs to be turned on or off at the same time or marquee chasing \neffect, thus minimizing I2C-bus commands. Seven hardware address pins allow up to \n126 devices on the same bus.\nThe Software Reset (SWRST) Call allows the master to perform a reset of the PCA9634 \nthrough the I2C-bus, identical to the Power-On Reset (POR) that initializes the registers to \ntheir default state causing the outputs to be se t HIGH (LED off). This allows an easy and \nquick way to reconfigure all device registers to the same condition.PCA9634\n8-bit Fm+ I2C-bus LED driver\nRev. 7.1 — 18 December 2017 Product data sheet\nPCA9634 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2017.

Functional description\nRefer to Figure 1 “ Block diagram of PCA9634 ”.\n7.1 Device addresses\nFollowing a START condition, the bus master must output the address of the slave it is \naccessing.\nThere are a maximum of 128 possible programmable addresses using the 7 hardware \naddress pins. Two of these addresses, Software Reset and LED All Call, cannot be used \nbecause their default power-up state is ON, leaving a maximum of 126 addresses. Using \nother reserved addresses, as  well as any other Sub Call address, will reduce the total \nnumber of possible addresses even further.\n7.1.1 Regular I2C-bus slave address\nThe I2C-bus slave address of the PCA9634 is shown in Figure 5 . To conserve power, no \ninternal pull-up resistors are incorporated on the hardware selectable address pins and they must be pulled HIGH or LOW.\nRemark: Using reserved I\n2C-bus addresses will interfere wit h other devices, but only if \nthe devices are on the bus and/or the bus will be open to other I2C-bus systems at some \nlater date. In a closed system where the designer controls the address assignment these \naddresses can be used since the PCA9634 treats them like any other address. The LED All Call, Software Rest and PCA9564 or PCA9665 slave address (if on the bus) can \nnever be used for individual device addresses.\n•PCA9634 LED All Call address (1110 000) and Software Reset (0000 0110) which are \nactive on start-up\n•PCA9564 (0000 000) or PCA9665 (1110 000 ) slave address which is active on \nstart-up\n•‘reserved for future use’ I2C-bus addresses (0000 011, 1111 1XX)\n•slave devices that use the 10-bit addressing scheme (1111 0XX)\n•slave devices that are designed to resp ond to the General Call address (0000 000)\n•High-speed mode (Hs-mode) master code (0000 1XX).\n \nThe last bit of the address byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a read is selected, while a lo gic 0 selects a write operation.Fig 5.

All the \nPCA9634s on the I2C-bus will acknowledge the ad dress if sent by the I2C-bus master.\n7.1.3 LED Sub Call I2C-bus addresses\n•3 different I2C-bus addresses can be used\n•Default power-up values: \n–SUBADR1 register: E2h or 1110 001X\n–SUBADR2 register: E4h or 1110 010X\n–SUBADR3 register: E8h or 1110 100X\n•Programmable through I2C-bus (volatile programming)\n•At power-up, Sub Call I2C-bus addresses are disabled. PCA9634 does not send an \nACK when E2h (R/W =0 )  o r  E 3 h  ( R / W = 1), E4h (R/W = 0) or E5h (R/W =1 ) ,  o r  \nE8h (R/W = 0) or E9h (R/W = 1) is sent by the master.\nSee Section 7.3.7 “ SUBADR1 to SUBADR3: I2C-bus subaddress 1 to 3 ” for more detail.\nRemark: The default LED Sub Call I2C-bus addresses may be used as regular I2C-bus \nslave addresses as long as they are disabled.\n7.1.4 Software Reset I2C-bus address\nThe address shown in Figure 6  is used when a reset of the PCA9634 needs to be \nperformed by the master. The Software Reset address (SWRST Call) must be used with \nR/W = 0. If R/W = 1, the PCA9634 does not acknowledge the SWRST. See Section 7.6 \n“Software Reset ” for more detail.\n \nRemark: The Software Reset I2C-bus address is a reserved address and cannot be used \nas a regular I2C-bus slave address or as an LED All Call or LED Sub Call address.Fig 6.

The highest 3 bits are used as Auto-Increment flag and Auto-Increment options \n(AI[2:0]).\n \nWhen the Auto-Increment flag is set (AI2 = 1), t he five low order bits of the Control register \nare automatically incremented after a read or wr ite. This allows the user to program the \nregisters sequentially. Four different types of Auto-Increment are possible, depending on \nAI1 and AI0 values.\n \nRemark: Other combinations not shown in Table 4  (AI[2:0] = 001, 010, and 011) are \nreserved and must not be used for proper device operation.\nAI[2:0] = 000 is used when the same register must be accessed several times during a \nsingle I2C-bus communication, for example, changes the brightness of a single LED. Data \nis overwritten each time the register is accessed during a write operation.\nAI[2:0] = 100 is used when all the registers mu st be sequentially accessed, for example, \npower-up programming.\nAI[2:0] = 101 is used when the four LED driv ers must be individually programmed with \ndifferent values during the same I2C-bus communication, for example, changing color \nsetting to another color setting.reset state = 80h\nRemark: The Control register does not apply to the Software Reset I2C-bus address.\nFig 7.

This address is programmable through the I2C-bus and can be used during either \nan I2C-bus read or write sequence. The register address can also be programmed as a \nSub Call.\nOnly the 7 MSBs representing the All Call I2C-bus address are valid. The LSB in \nALLCALLADR register is a read-only bit (0).\nIf ALLCALL bit = 0, the device does not acknowledge the address programmed in register \nALLCALLADR.\n7.4 Active LOW output enable input\nThe active LOW output enable (OE ) pin, allows to enable or disable all the LED outputs at \nthe same time.\n•When a LOW level is applied to OE  pin, all the LED outputs are enabled and follow \nthe output state defined in the LEDOUT regi ster with the polarity defined by INVRT bit \n(MODE2 register).\n•When a HIGH level is applied to OE  pin, all the LED outputs are programmed to the \nvalue that is defined by OUTN E[1:0] in the MODE2 register.\n \nThe OE  pin can be used as a synchronization si gnal to switch on/off several PCA9634 \ndevices at the same time. This requires an exte rnal clock reference that provides blinking \nperiod and the duty cycle.\nThe OE  pin can also be used as an external dimming control signal. The frequency of the \nexternal clock must be high enough not to be seen by the human eye, and the duty cycle \nvalue determines the brightness of the LEDs.Remark: Do not use OE\n as an external blinking control signal when internal global \nblinking is selected (DMBLNK = 1, MODE2 register) since it will result in an undefined \nblinking pattern. Do not use OE  as an external dimming control signal when internal global \ndimming is selected (DMBLNK = 0, MODE2 register) since it will result in an undefined \ndimming pattern.Table 13.

At this point, the reset condition is released and the \nPCA9634 registers and I2C-bus state machine ar e initialized to their default states (all \nzeroes) causing all the channels to be deselected. Thereafter, V DD must be lowered below \n0.2 V to reset the device.\n7.6 Software Reset\nThe Software Reset Call (SWRST Call)  allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to \nthe power-up state value through a specific formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed \ncorrectly, it im plies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the \nbus.\nThe SWRST Call function is defined as the following:\n1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.\n2. The reserved SWRST I2C-bus address ‘0000 011’ with the R/W  bit set to ‘0’ (write) is \nsent by the I2C-bus master. \n3. The PCA9634 device(s) acknowledge(s) after seeing the SWRST Call address \n‘0000 0110’ (06h) only. If the R/W  bit is set to ‘1’ (read), no acknowledge is returned to \nthe I2C-bus master.\n4. Once the SWRST Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends \n2 bytes with 2 specific values (SWRST data byte 1 and byte 2):\na. Byte 1 = A5h: the PCA9634 acknowledges this value only. If byte 1 is not equal to \nA5h, the PCA9634 does not acknowledge it.\nb. Byte 2 = 5Ah: the PCA9634 acknowledges this value only. If byte 2 is not equal to \n5Ah, then the PCA9634 does not acknowledge it.\nIf more than 2 bytes of data are sent, the PCA9634 does not acknowledge any more.\n5. Once the right 2 bytes (SWRST data byte 1 and byte 2 only) have been sent and \ncorrectly acknowledged, the master sends a STOP command to end the \nSWRST Call: the PCA9634 then resets to the default value (power-up value) and is \nready to be addressed again within the specified bus free time (t BUF).\nThe I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the PCA9634 (at any time) as \na ‘SWRST Call Abort’. The PCA9634 does not initiate a reset of its registers. This \nhappens only when the format of the SWRST Call sequence is not correct.\nPCA9634 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2017.

Characteristics of the I2C-bus\nThe I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two \nlines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply via a pull-up re sistor when connected to the output stages \nof a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n8.1 Bit transfer\nOne data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain \nstable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 9\n).\n \n8.1.1 START and STOP conditions\nBoth data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW \ntransition of the data line while the clock is HI GH is defined as the START condition (S). A \nLOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP \ncondition (P) (see Figure 10 ).\n \n8.2 System configuration\nA device generating a message is a ‘transmitter ’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The \ndevice that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by \nthe master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 11 ).Fig 9.

Ea ch byte of eight bits is followed by one \nacknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter, \nwhereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.\nA slave receiver which is addressed must gen erate an acknowledge af ter the reception of \neach byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte \nthat has been clocked out of the slave transm itter. The device that acknowledges has to \npull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold \ntime must be taken into account.\nA master receiver must signal an end of da ta to the transmitter by not generating an \nacknowledge on the last byte that has been cloc ked out of the slave. In this event, the \ntransmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP \ncondition.\n Fig 11.

Application design-in information\n \nQuestion 1: What kind of edge rate control is there on the outputs?\n•The typical edge rates depend on the output configuration, supply voltage, and the \napplied load. The outputs can be configured as either open-drain NMOS or \ntotem-pole outputs. If the customer is usi ng the part to directly drive LEDs, they \nshould be using it in an open-drain NMOS, if they are concerned about the maximum \nISS and ground bounce. The edge rate cont rol was designed primarily to slow down \nthe turn-on of the output devic e; it turns off rather quickly (~1.5 ns). In simulation, the \ntypical turn-on time for the open-drain NMOS was ~14 ns (V DD=3 . 6V ;  C L=5 0p F ;  \nRPU= 500\uf057).\nQuestion 2: Is ground bounce possible?\n•Ground bounce is a possibility,  especially if all 16 output s are changed at full current \n(25 mA each). There is a fair amount of decoupling capacitance on chip (~50 pF), \nwhich is intended to suppress  some of the groun d bounce. The customer will need to \ndetermine if additional decoupling capacitance externally placed as close as \nphysically possible to the device is required.I2C-bus address = 0010 101X.\nAll of the 8 LEDn outputs configurable as either open-drain or totem pole. Mixing of configurations is not possible.\n(1) OE  requires pull-up resistor if control signal from the master is open-drain.\nFig 18.

Although the \npackage only has one ground pin, there are two ground pads on the die itself \nconnected to this one pin. Al though some ground bounce is likely, it will not disrupt the \noperation of the part and would be reduced by the external decoupling capacitance.\nQuestion 4: I can’t turn the LEDs on or off, but their registers are set properly. Why?\n•Check the Mode Register 1 bit 4 SLEEP settin g. The value needs to be 0 so that the \nOSC is turn on. If the OSC is turned off, the LEDs cannot be turned on or off and also can’t be dimmed or blinked.\nQuestion 5: I’m using LEDs with integrated Zener di odes and the IC is getting very hot. \nWhy?\n•The IC outputs can be set to either open-drain or push-pull and default to push-pull outputs. In this application with the Zener diodes, they need to be set to open-drain \nsince in the push-pull architectu re there is a low resistance path to ground through the \nZener and this is causing the IC to overheat. The PCA9632/33/34/35 ICs all power-up in the push-pull output mode and with the lo gic state HIGH, so one of the first things \nthat need to be done is to set the outputs to open-drain.\n11.

Handling information\nAll input and output pins are protected ag ainst ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under \nnormal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as \ndescribed in JESD625-A  or equivalent standards.\n17. Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n17.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n17.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from \na standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, \nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n17.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\nPCA9634 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2017.

It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 20  and 21\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 25 .Table 20.
