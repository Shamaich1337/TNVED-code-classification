This pin can be used to blow an in-line fuse to permanently disable the battery pack from charging or\ndischarging. See the BQ40Z50-R2  Technical Reference Manual  (SLUUBK0 ) for detailed descriptions of each\nprotection function.\nThe secondary safety features provide protection against:\n• Safety Overvoltage Permanent Failure\n• Safety Undervoltage Permanent Failure\n• Safety Overtemperature Permanent Failure\n• Safety FET Overtemperature Permanent Failure\n• Qmax Imbalance Permanent Failure\n• Impedance Imbalance Permanent Failure\n• Capacity Degradation Permanent Failure\n• Cell Balancing Permanent Failure\n• Fuse Failure Permanent Failure\n• PTC Permanent Failure\n• Voltage Imbalance At Rest Permanent Failure\n• Voltage Imbalance Active Permanent Failure\n• Charge FET Permanent Failure\n• Discharge FET Permanent Failure\n• AFE Register Permanent Failure\n• AFE Communication Permanent Failure\n• Second Level Protector Permanent Failure\n• Instruction Flash Checksum Permanent Failure\n• Open Cell Connection Permanent Failurewww.ti.comBQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\n• Data Flash Permanent Failure\n• Open Thermistor Permanent Failure\n8.3.3 Charge Control Features\nThe BQ40Z50-R2 charge control features include:\n• Supports JEITA temperature ranges. Reports charging voltage and charging current according to the active\ntemperature range\n• Handles more complex charging profiles. Allows for splitting the standard temperature range into two sub-\nranges and allows for varying the charging current according to the cell voltage\n• Reports the appropriate charging current needed for constant current charging and the appropriate charging\nvoltage needed for constant voltage charging to a smart charger using SMBus broadcasts\n• Reduces the charge difference of the battery cells in a fully charged state of the battery pack gradually using\na voltage-based cell balancing algorithm during charging. A voltage threshold can be set up for cell balancing\nto be active. This prevents fully charged cells from overcharging and causing excessive degradation and also\nincreases the usable pack energy by preventing premature charge termination.\n• Supports precharging/0-volt charging\n• Supports charge inhibit and charge suspend if battery pack temperature is out of temperature range\n• Reports charging fault and also indicates charge status via charge and discharge alarms\n8.3.4 Gas Gauging\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  uses the Impedance Track algorithm to measure and calculate the available capacity in\nbattery cells. The BQ40Z50-R2 accumulates a measure of charge and discharge currents and compensates the\ncharge current measurement for the temperature and state-of-charge of the battery. The BQ40Z50-R2 estimates\nself-discharge of the battery and also adjusts the self-discharge estimation based on temperature. The device\nalso has TURBO Mode 2.0 support, which enables the BQ40Z50-R2  to provide the necessary data for the\nMCU to determine what level of peak power consumption can be applied without causing a system reset or\ntransient battery voltage level spike to trigger termination flags. See the BQ40Z50-R2  Technical Reference\nManual  (SLUUBK0 ) for further details.\n8.3.5 Configuration\n8.3.5.1 Oscillator Function\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  fully integrates the system oscillators and does not require any external components to\nsupport this feature.\n8.3.5.2 System Present Operation\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  checks the PRES  pin periodically (1 s). If PRES  input is pulled to ground by the external\nsystem, the BQ40Z50-R2 detects this as system present.\n8.3.5.3 Emergency Shutdown\nFor battery maintenance, the emergency shutdown feature enables a push button action connecting the\nSHUTDN  pin to shut down an embedded battery pack system before removing the battery. A high-to-low\ntransition of the SHUTDN  pin signals the BQ40Z50-R2  to turn off the CHG and DSG FETs, disconnecting the\npower from the system to safely remove the battery pack. The CHG and DSG FETs can be turned on again by\nanother high-to-low transition detected by the SHUTDN pin or when a data flash configurable timeout is reached.\n8.3.5.4 1-Series, 2-Series, 3-Series, or 4-Series Cell Configuration\nIn a 1-series cell configuration, VC4 is shorted to VC, VC2, and VC1. In a 2-series cell configuration, VC4 is\nshorted to VC3 and VC2. In a 3-series cell configuration, VC4 is shorted to VC3.\n8.3.5.5 Cell Balancing\nThe device supports cell balancing by bypassing the current of each cell during charging or at rest. If the\ndevice\'s internal bypass is used, up to 10 mA can be bypassed and multiple cells can be bypassed at the same\ntime. Higher cell balance current can be achieved by using an external cell balancing circuit. In external cell\nbalancing mode, only one cell at a time can be balanced.BQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\nThe cell balancing algorithm determines the amount of charge needed to be bypassed to balance the capacity of\nall cells.\n8.3.6 Battery Parameter Measurements\n8.3.6.1 Charge and Discharge Counting\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  uses an integrating delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for current measurement,\nand a second delta-sigma ADC for individual cell and battery voltage and temperature measurement.\nThe integrating delta-sigma ADC measures the charge/discharge flow of the battery by measuring the voltage\ndrop across a small-value sense resistor between the SRP and SRN terminals. The integrating ADC measures\nbipolar signals from –0.1 V to 0.1 V. The BQ40Z50-R2  detects charge activity when V SR = V (SRP) – V (SRN)\nis positive, and discharge activity when V SR = V (SRP) – V (SRN) is negative. The BQ40Z50-R2  continuously\nintegrates the signal over time, using an internal counter. The fundamental rate of the counter is 0.26 nVh.\n8.3.7 Battery Trip Point (BTP)\nRequired for WIN8 OS, the battery trip point (BTP) feature indicates when the RSOC of a battery pack has\ndepleted to a certain value set in a DF register. This feature enables a host to program two capacity-based\nthresholds that govern the triggering of a BTP interrupt on the BTP_INT pin, and the setting or clearing of the\nOperationStatus[BTP_INT]  on the basis of RemainingCapacity() .\nAn internal weak pullup is applied when the BTP feature is active. Depending on the system design, an external\npullup may be required to put on the BTP_INT pin. See Section 7.12  for details.\n8.3.8 Lifetime Data Logging Features\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  offers lifetime data logging for several critical battery parameters. The following parameters\nare updated every 10 hours if a difference is detected between values in RAM and data flash:\n• Maximum and Minimum Cell Voltages\n• Maximum Delta Cell Voltage\n• Maximum Charge Current\n• Maximum Discharge Current\n• Maximum Average Discharge Current\n• Maximum Average Discharge Power\n• Maximum and Minimum Cell Temperature\n• Maximum Delta Cell Temperature\n• Maximum and Minimum Internal Sensor Temperature\n• Maximum FET Temperature\n• Number of Safety Events Occurrences and the Last Cycle of the Occurrence\n• Number of Valid Charge Termination and the Last Cycle of the Valid Charge Termination\n• Number of Qmax and Ra Updates and the Last Cycle of the Qmax and Ra Updates\n• Number of Shutdown Events\n• Cell Balancing Time for Each Cell\n(This data is updated every 2 hours if a difference is detected.)\n• Total FW Runtime and Time Spent in Each Temperature Range\n(This data is updated every 2 hours if a difference is detected.)\n8.3.9 Authentication\nThe BQ40Z50-R2 supports authentication by the host using SHA-1.\n8.3.10 LED Display\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  can drive a 3-, 4-, or 5- segment LED display for remaining capacity indication and/or a\npermanent fail (PF) error code indication.\n8.3.11 IATA Support\nThe BQ40Z50-R2 supports IATA with several new commands and procedures. See the BQ40Z50-R2 Technical\nReference Manual  (SLUUBK0 ) for further details.www.ti.comBQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\n8.3.12 Voltage\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  updates the individual series cell voltages at 0.25-s intervals. The internal ADC of the\nBQ40Z50-R2  measures the voltage, and scales and calibrates it appropriately. This data is also used to\ncalculate the impedance of the cell for the Impedance Track gas gauging.\n8.3.13 Current\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  uses the SRP and SRN inputs to measure and calculate the battery charge and discharge\ncurrent using a 1-mΩ to 3-mΩ typ. sense resistor.\n8.3.14 Temperature\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  has an internal temperature sensor and inputs for four external temperature sensors. All\nfive temperature sensor options can be individually enabled and configured for cell or FET temperature usage.\nTwo configurable thermistor models are provided to allow the monitoring of cell temperature in addition to FET\ntemperature, which use a different thermistor profile.\n8.3.15 Communications\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  uses SMBus v1.1 with MASTER mode and packet error checking (PEC) options per the SBS\nspecification.\n8.3.15.1 SMBus On and Off State\nThe BQ40Z50-R2 detects an SMBus off state when SMBC and SMBD are low for two or more seconds. Clearing\nthis state requires that either SMBC or SMBD transition high. The communication bus will resume activity within\n1 ms.\n8.3.15.2 SBS Commands\nSee the BQ40Z50-R2 Technical Reference Manual  (SLUUBK0 ) for further details.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe BQ40Z50-R2 supports three power modes to reduce power consumption:\n• In NORMAL mode, the BQ40Z50-R2 performs measurements, calculations, protection decisions, and data\nupdates in 250-ms intervals. Between these intervals, the BQ40Z50-R2 is in a reduced power stage.\n• In SLEEP mode, the BQ40Z50-R2 performs measurements, calculations, protection decisions, and data\nupdates in adjustable time intervals. Between these intervals, the BQ40Z50-R2 is in a reduced power stage.\nThe BQ40Z50-R2 has a wake function that enables exit from SLEEP mode when current flow or failure is\ndetected.\n• In SHUTDOWN mode, the BQ40Z50-R2 is completely disabled.\nSee the BQ40Z50-R2 Technical Reference Manual  (SLUUBK0 ) for further details.BQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,\nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Then update the cell configuration (see the BQ40Z50-R2 Technical Reference\nManual  [SLUUBK0 ] for details) before removing the charger connection.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n9.2.2.1 High-Current Path\nThe high-current path begins at the PACK+ terminal of the battery pack. As charge current travels through the\npack, it finds its way through protection FETs, a chemical fuse, the Li-ion cells and cell connections, and the\nsense resistor, and then returns to the PACK– terminal (see Figure 9-2 ). In addition, some components are\nplaced across the PACK+ and PACK– terminals to reduce effects from electrostatic discharge.\n9.2.2.1.1 Protection FETs\nSelect the N-channel charge and discharge FETs for a given application. Most portable battery applications are a\ngood match for the CSD17308Q3. The TI CSD17308Q3 is a 47A, 30-V device with Rds(on) of 8.2 m Ω when the\ngate drive voltage is 8 V.\nIf a precharge FET is used, R1 is calculated to limit the precharge current to the desired rate. Be sure to account\nfor the power dissipation of the series resistor. The precharge current is limited to (V CHARGER  – V BAT)/R1 and\nmaximum power dissipation is (V charger  – V bat)2/R1.\nThe gates of all protection FETs are pulled to the source with a high-value resistor between the gate and source\nto ensure they are turned off if the gate drive is open.\nCapacitors C1 and C2 help protect the FETs during an ESD event. Using two devices ensures normal operation\nif one becomes shorted. To have good ESD protection, the copper trace inductance of the capacitor leadswww.ti.comBQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\nmust be designed to be as short and wide as possible. Ensure that the voltage ratings of both C1 and C2 are\nadequate to hold off the applied voltage if one of the capacitors becomes shorted.\nFigure 9-2. BQ40Z50-R2 Protection FETs\n9.2.2.1.2 Chemical Fuse\nThe chemical fuse (Dexerials, Uchihashi, and so on) is ignited under command from either the bq294700\nsecondary voltage protection IC or from the FUSE pin of the gas gauge. Either of these events applies a positive\nvoltage to the gate of Q5, shown in Figure 9-3 , which then sinks current from the third terminal of the fuse,\ncausing it to ignite and open permanently.\nIt is important to carefully review the fuse specifications and match the required ignition current to that available\nfrom the N-channel FET. Ensure that the proper voltage, current, and Rds(on) ratings are used for this device.\nThe fuse control circuit is discussed in detail in Section 9.2.2.2.5 .\n4P\nto 2ndLevel Protector to FUSE Pin\nFigure 9-3. FUSE Circuit\n9.2.2.1.3 Li-Ion Cell Connections\nFor cell connections, it is important to remember that high current flows through the top and bottom connections;\ntherefore, the voltage sense leads at these points must be made with a Kelvin connection to avoid any errors\ndue to a drop in the high-current copper trace. The location marked 4P in Figure 9-4  indicates the Kelvin\nconnection of the most positive battery node. The connection marked 1N is equally important. The VC5 pin\n(a ground reference for cell voltage measurement), which is in the older generation devices, is not in the\nBQ40Z50-R2  device. Therefore, the single-point connection at 1N to the low-current ground is needed to avoid\nan unwanted voltage drop through long traces while the gas gauge is measuring the bottom cell voltage.BQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n32 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\nFigure 9-4. Li-Ion Cell Connections\n9.2.2.1.4 Sense Resistor\nAs with the cell connections, the quality of the Kelvin connections at the sense resistor is critical. The sense\nresistor must have a temperature coefficient no greater than 50 ppm in order to minimize current measurement\ndrift with temperature. Choose the value of the sense resistor to correspond to the available overcurrent and\nshort-circuit ranges of the BQ40Z50-R2  device. Select the smallest value possible to minimize the negative\nvoltage generated on the BQ40Z50-R2  VSS node(s) during a short circuit. This pin has an absolute minimum\nof –0.3 V. Parallel resistors can be used as long as good Kelvin sensing is ensured. The device is designed to\nsupport a 1-mΩ to 3-mΩ sense resistor.\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  ground scheme is different from that of the older generation devices. In previous devices,\nthe device ground (or low current ground) is connected to the SRN side of the R SENSE  resistor pad. In the\nBQ40Z50-R2  device, however, it connects the low-current ground on the SRP side of the R SENSE  resistor pad\nclose to the battery 1N terminal (see Section 9.2.2.1.3 ). This is because the BQ40Z50-R2  device has one less\nVC pin (a ground reference pin VC5) compared to the previous devices. The pin was removed and was internally\ncombined to SRP.\nFigure 9-5. Sense Resistor\n9.2.2.1.5 ESD Mitigation\nA pair of series 0.1- μF ceramic capacitors is placed across the PACK+ and PACK– terminals to help in the\nmitigation of external electrostatic discharges. The two devices in series ensure continued operation of the pack\nif one of the capacitors becomes shorted.\nOptionally, a tranzorb such as the SMBJ2A can be placed across the terminals to further improve ESD immunity.\n9.2.2.2 Gas Gauge Circuit\nThe gas gauge circuit includes the BQ40Z50-R2  and its peripheral components. These components are divided\ninto the following groups: differential low-pass filter, PBI, system present, SMBus communication, fuse circuit,\nand LED.\n9.2.2.2.1 Coulomb-Counting Interface\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  uses an integrating delta-sigma ADC for current measurements. Add a 100- Ω resistor from\nthe sense resistor to the SRP and SRN inputs of the device. Place a 0.1-µF (C18) filter capacitor across the SRP\nand SRN inputs.www.ti.comBQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 33\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\nFigure 9-6. Differential Filter\n9.2.2.2.2 Power Supply Decoupling and PBI\nThe BQ40Z50-R2  device has an internal LDO that is internally compensated and does not require an external\ndecoupling capacitor.\nThe PBI pin is used as a power supply backup input pin, providing power during brief transient power outages. A\nstandard 2.2-µF ceramic capacitor is connected from the PBI pin to ground, as shown in Figure 9-7 .\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedC13\n2.2 μF1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nvss\nTS1\nTS2\nTS3\nTS4NC\nBTP_INT PRES or SHUTDN9 101112 1314 1516PBI\nVC4\nVC3\nVC2\nVC1\nSRN\nNC\nSRPPWPDBATCHGPCHGNCDSGPACKVCCFUSE\nPTCEN\nPTC\nLEDCNTLC\nLEDCNTLB\nLEDCNTLA\nSMBC\nSMBD\nDISP3332 31 30292827 2625\n24\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n18\n17\nFigure 9-7. Power Supply Decoupling\n9.2.2.2.3 System Present\nThe system present signal informs the gas gauge whether the pack is installed into or removed from the system.\nIn the host system, this pin is grounded. The PRES  pin of the BQ40Z50-R2  device is occasionally sampled to\ntest for system present. In ACTIVE mode, the PRES pin is pulsed every 250 ms for a duration of 5 ms (RHOEN\nis on), and just before it is turned off, the state of the PRES pin is checked to see if it is low or high. The average\nof the four measurements is used to determine if the PRES is asserted or not. In SLEEP mode, the PRES pin is\npulsed every "Sleep Voltage Time," and the state of the PRES  pin is determined. A resistor can be used to pull\nthe signal low and the resistance must be 20 k Ω or lower to ensure that the test pulse is lower than the V IL limit.\nThe pullup current source is typically 10 µA to 20 µA. When the PRES  pin is not pulsed, the PRES  pin is tied\ninternally to VSS (RHOUT is on), and any pullup on the PRES  pin will cause a battery drain when not charging.\nRefer to the PRES pin diagram inBQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\n<20 K13 14 15 16\nVILTS4 NC BTP_INT PRESFigure 9-8. System Present Pull-Down Resistor\nBecause the System Present signal is part of the pack connector interface to the outside world, it must be\nprotected from external electrostatic discharge events. The PRES  pin has integrated ESD protection to 2 kV.\nExternal protection can be added to support higher ESD protection requirements. The TPD1E10B06 single-\nchannel ESD protection diode (U2) can protect the input up to 30 kV, and the R8 reduces the holding current to\nrelease the internal SCR in the event that it triggers.\nto Discharge FET\nFigure 9-9. System Present ESD and Short Protection\n9.2.2.2.4 SMBus Communication\nThe SMBus clock and data pins have integrated high-voltage ESD protection circuits; however, adding\nTPD1E10B06 ESD protection diodes (U4 and U5) and series resistors (R24 and R25) provides more robust\nESD performance.www.ti.comBQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 35\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\nThe SMBus clock and data lines have internal pulldown. When the gas gauge senses that both lines are low\n(such as during removal of the pack), the device performs auto-offset calibration and then goes into SLEEP\nmode to conserve power.\nFigure 9-10. ESD Protection for SMBus Communication\n9.2.2.2.5 FUSE Circuitry\nThe FUSE pin of the BQ40Z50-R2  device is designed to ignite the chemical fuse if one of the various safety\ncriteria is violated. The FUSE pin also monitors the state of the secondary-voltage protection IC. Q5 ignites the\nchemical fuse when its gate is high. The 7-V output of the bq294700 is divided by R18 and R19, which provides\nadequate gate drive for Q5 while guarding against excessive back current into the bq294700 if the FUSE signal\nis high.\nUsing C7 is generally a good practice, especially for RFI immunity. C7 may be removed, if desired, because the\nchemical fuse is a comparatively slow device and is not affected by any sub-microsecond glitches that come\nfrom the FUSE output during the cell connection process.\nIf the AFEFUSE output is not used, it should be connected to VSS.\n4P\nto 2ndLevel Protector to FUSE Pin\nFigure 9-11. FUSE Circuit\nWhen the BQ40Z50-R2 device is commanded to ignite the chemical fuse, the FUSE pin activates to give a\ntypical 8-V output. The new design makes it possible to use a higher Vgs FET for Q5. This improves the\nrobustness of the system, as well as widens the choices for Q5.\n9.2.2.3 Secondary-Current Protection\nThe BQ40Z50-R2 device provides secondary overcurrent and short-circuit protection, cell balancing, cell voltage\nmultiplexing, and voltage translation. The following section examines cell and battery inputs, pack and FET\ncontrol, temperature output, and cell balancing.BQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\n9.2.2.3.1 Cell and Battery Inputs\nEach cell input is conditioned with a simple RC filter, which provides ESD protection during cell connect and acts\nto filter unwanted voltage transients. The resistor value allows some trade-off for cell balancing versus safety\nprotection.\nThe integrated cell balancing FETs enable the AFE to bypass cell current around a given cell or numerous cells,\neffectively balancing the entire battery stack. External series resistors placed between the cell connections and\nthe VCx I/O pins set the balancing current magnitude. The internal FETs provide a 200- Ω resistance (2 V < VDS\n< 4 V). Series input resistors between 100 Ω and 300 Ω are recommended for effective cell balancing.\nThe BAT input uses a diode (D1) to isolate and decouple it from the cells in the event of a transient dip in voltage\ncaused by a short-circuit event.\nAlso, as described in Section 9.2.2.1 , the top and bottom nodes of the cells must be sensed at the battery\nconnections with a Kelvin connection to prevent voltage sensing errors caused by a drop in the high-current PCB\ncopper.\nFigure 9-12. Cell and BAT Inputs\n9.2.2.3.2 External Cell Balancing\nInternal cell balancing can only support up to 10 mA. External cell balancing is provided as another option for\nfaster cell balancing. For details, refer to the application note, Fast Cell Balancing Using External MOSFET\n(SLUA420 ).\n9.2.2.3.3 PACK and FET Control\nThe PACK and V CC inputs provide power to the BQ40Z50-R2  device from the charger. The PACK input also\nprovides a method to measure and detect the presence of a charger. The PACK input uses a 10-k Ω resistor;\nwhereas, the V CC input uses an internal diode to guard against input transients and prevent a misoperation of\nthe gate driver during short-circuit events.www.ti.comBQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 37\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\nFigure 9-13. BQ40Z50-R2 PACK and FET Control\nThe N-channel charge and discharge FETs are controlled with 5.1-k Ω series gate resistors, which provide a\nswitching time constant of a few microseconds. The 10-M Ω resistors ensure that the FETs are off in the event\nof an open connection to the FET drivers. Q4 is provided to protect the discharge FET (Q3) in the event of a\nreverse-connected charger. Without Q4, Q3 can be driven into its linear region and suffer severe damage if the\nPACK+ input becomes slightly negative.\nQ4 turns on in that case to protect Q3 by shorting its gate to source. To use the simple ground gate circuit, the\nFET must have a low gate turn-on threshold. If it is desired to use a more standard device, such as the 2N7002\nas the reference schematic, the gate should be biased up to 3.3 V with a high-value resistor. The BQ40Z50-R2\ndevice has the capability to provide a current-limited charging path typically used for low battery voltage or\nlow temperature charging. The BQ40Z50-R2  device uses an external P-channel, precharge FET controlled by\nPCHG.\n9.2.2.3.4 Temperature Output\nFor the BQ40Z50-R2  device, TS1, TS2, TS3, and TS4 provide thermistor drive-under program control. Each\npin can be enabled with an integrated 18-kΩ (typical) linearization pullup resistor to support the use of a 10-k Ω\nat 25°C (103) NTC external thermistor, such as a Mitsubishi BN35-3H103. The reference design includes four\n10-kΩ  thermistors: RT2, RT3, RT4, and RT5.

Normally, the BAT\ninput is the primary power source to the device. The BAT pin should be connected to the positive termination of\nthe battery stack. The input voltage for the BAT pin ranges from 2.2 V to 26 V.\nThe VCC pin is the secondary power input, which activates when the BAT voltage falls below minimum V CC. This\nenables the device to source power from a charger (if present) connected to the PACK pin. The VCC pin should\nbe connected to the common drain of the CHG and DSG FETs. The charger input should be connected to the\nPACK pin.www.ti.comBQ40Z50-R2\nSLUSCS4C – JUNE 2017 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 41\nProduct Folder Links: BQ40Z50-R2\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nA battery fuel gauge circuit board is a challenging environment due to the fundamental incompatibility of high-\ncurrent traces and ultra-low current semiconductor devices. The best way to protect against unwanted trace-to-\ntrace coupling is with a component placement, such as that shown in Figure 11-1 , where the high-current section\nis on the opposite side of the board from the electronic devices. Clearly, this is not possible in many situations\ndue to mechanical constraints. Still, every attempt should be made to route high-current traces away from signal\ntraces, which enter the BQ40Z50-R2  directly. IC references and registers can be disturbed and in rare cases\ndamaged due to magnetic and capacitive coupling from the high-current path.\nNote\nDuring surge current and ESD events, the high-current traces appear inductive and can couple\nunwanted noise into sensitive nodes of the gas gauge electronics, as illustrated in Figure 11-2 .\nLow Level CircuitsBAT +\nPACK+ PACK–BAT –\nR1 J1C1F1Q2Q1C3 C2\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 11-1.
