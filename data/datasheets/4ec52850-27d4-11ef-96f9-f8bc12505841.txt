The resistive glaze is covered by a protective  glass.  \nThe composition of the glaze is adjusted  to give the approximately  required resistance value and laser  trimming of this \nresistive glaze achieves  the value within tolerance. The whole  element is covered by a protective  overcoat. Size 0603 and \nbigger is  marked with the resistance value on top.
