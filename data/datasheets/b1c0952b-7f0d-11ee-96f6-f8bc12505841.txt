When the connection is made, the LTC4300A-1/LTC4300A-2 provide bidirectional buffering, keeping the backplane and card capacitances isolated. Rise-time accelerator circuitry* allows the use of weaker DC pull-up currents while still meeting rise-time requirements. During insertion, the SDA and SCL lines are precharged to 1V to minimize bus disturbances.\nThe LTC4300A-1 incorporates a CMOS threshold digital \nENABLE input pin, which forces the part into a low current mode when driven to ground and sets normal operation when driven to V\nCC. It also includes an open drain READY \noutput pin, which indicates that the backplane and card sides are connected together. The LTC4300A-2 replaces the ENABLE pin with a dedicated supply voltage pin, V\nCC2, \nfor the card side, providing level shifting between 3.3V and 5V systems. Both the backplane and card may be powered with supply voltages ranging from 2.7V to 5.5V, with no constraints on which supply voltage is higher. The LTC4300A-2 also replaces the READY pin with a digital CMOS input pin, ACC, which enables and disables the rise-time accelerator currents.\nThe LTC4300A is available in a small 8-pin MSOP package.\nInput–Output Connection t PLHAPPLICATIONSn Bidirectional Buffer for SDA and SCL Lines \nIncreases Fanout\nn Prevents SDA and SCL Corruption During Live \nBoard Insertion and Removal from Backplane\nn Isolates Input SDA and SCL Lines from Output\nn Compatible with I2C, I2C Fast Mode and SMBus \nStandards (Up to 400kHz Operation)\nn Low I CC Chip Disable: <1μA (LTC4300A-1)\nn READY Open Drain Output (LTC4300A-1)\nn 1V Precharge on all SDA and SCL Lines\nn Supports Clock Stretching, Arbitration and \nSynchronization\nn 5V to 3.3V Level T ranslation (LTC4300A-2)\nn High Impedance SDA, SCL Pins for V CC = 0V\nn Small MSOP 8-Pin Package\nn Hot Board Insertion\nn Servers\nn Capacitance Buffer/Bus Extender\nn Desktop Computer\nL, L T, L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks and Hot \nSwap and ThinSOT are trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.

For the LTC4300A-1, this is a digital CMOS threshold input pin. Grounding this pin puts the part in a low current (<1μA) mode. It also disables the rise-time accelerators, disables the bus precharge circuitry, drives READY low, isolates SDAIN from SDAOUT and isolates SCLIN from SCLOUT. Drive ENABLE all the way to V \nCC for normal \noperation. Connect ENABLE to V CC if this feature is not \nbeing used. For the LTC4300A-2, this is the supply voltage for the devices on the card I\n2C busses. Connect pull-up \nresistors from SDAOUT and SCLOUT to this pin.

For the LTC4300A-1, this is an open-drain NMOS output which pulls low when either ENABLE is low or the start-up sequence described in the Operation section has not been completed. READY goes high when ENABLE is high and start-up is complete. Connect a 10k resistor from this pin to V\nCC to provide the pull up. For \nthe LTC4300A-2, this is a CMOS threshold digital input pin that enables and disables the rise-time accelerators on all four SDA and SCL pins.

Because of this isolation, the waveforms on the backplane busses look slightly different than the corresponding card bus waveforms, as described here.\nInput to Output Offset Voltage\nWhen a logic low voltage, V LOW1 , is driven on any of the \nLTC4300A’s data or clock pins, the LTC4300A regulates the voltage on the other side of the chip (call it V\nLOW2 ) \nto a slightly higher voltage, as directed by the following equation:\n V LOW2  = V LOW1  + 75mV + (V CC/R) • 100\nwhere R is the bus pull-up resistance in ohms. For ex-\nample, if a device is forcing SDAOUT to 10mV where V\nCC = 3.3V and the pull-up resistor R on SDAIN is 10k, \nthen the voltage on SDAIN = 10mV + 75mV + (3.3/10000) • 100 = 118mV. See the Typical Performance Character-istics section for curves showing the offset voltage as a function of V\nCC and R.\nPropagation Delays\nDuring a rising edge, the rise-time on each side is deter-\nmined by the combined pull-up current of the LTC4300A boost current and the bus resistor and the equivalent capacitance on the line. If the pull-up currents are the same, a difference in rise-time occurs which is directly proportional to the difference in capacitance between the two sides. This effect is displayed in Figure 1 for V\nCC = \n3.3V and a 10k pull-up resistor on each side (50pF on one side and 150pF on the other). Since the output side has less capacitance than the input, it rises faster and the effective t\nPLH is negative.\nThere is a finite propagation delay, t PHL, through the con-\nnection circuitry for falling waveforms. Figure 2 shows the falling edge waveforms for the same V\nCC, pull-up \nresistors and equivalent capacitance conditions as used in Figure 1. An external NMOS device pulls down the volt-age on the side with 150pF capacitance; the LTC4300A pulls down the voltage on the opposite side, with a delay of 55ns. This delay is always positive and is a function of Start-Up\nWhen the LTC4300A first receives power on its V\nCC pin, \neither during power-up or during live insertion, it starts in an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) state, ignoring any activity on the SDA and SCL pins until V\nCC rises above \n2.5V. For the LTC4300A-2, the part also waits for V CC2 to \nrise above 2V. This ensures that the part does not try to function until it has enough voltage to do so.\nDuring this time, the 1V precharge circuitry is also ac-\ntive and forces 1V through 100k nominal resistors to the SDA and SCL pins. Because the I/O card is being plugged into a live backplane, the voltage on the backplane SDA and SCL busses may be anywhere between 0V and V\nCC. \nPrecharging the SCL and SDA pins to 1V minimizes the worst-case voltage differential these pins will see at the moment of connection, therefore minimizing the amount of disturbance caused by the I/O card.\nOnce the LTC4300A comes out of UVLO, it assumes that \nSDAIN and SCLIN have been inserted into a live system and that SDAOUT and SCLOUT are being powered up at the same time as itself. Therefore, it looks for either a stop bit or bus idle condition on the backplane side to indicate the completion of a data transaction. When either one occurs, the part also verifies that both the SDAOUT and SCLOUT voltages are high. When all of these conditions are met, the input-to-output connection circuitry is activated, joining the SDA and SCL busses on the I/O card with those on the backplane, and the rise time accelerators are enabled.\nConnection Circuitry\nOnce the connection circuitry is activated, the functionality \nof the SDAIN and SDAOUT pins is identical. A low forced on either pin at any time results in both pin voltages being low. For proper operation, logic low input voltages should be no higher than 0.4V with respect to the ground pin voltage of the LTC4300A. SDAIN and SDAOUT enter a logic high state only when all devices on both SDAIN and SDAOUT release high. The same is true for SCLIN and SCLOUT. This  important feature ensures that clock stretching, clock synchronization, arbitration and the acknowledge protocol always work, regardless of how the devices in the system are tied to the LTC4300A.\nLTC4300A-1/LTC4300A-2\n94300a12faOPERATION\nsupply voltage, temperature and the pull-up resistors and \nequivalent bus capacitances on both sides of the bus. The Typical Performance Characteristics section shows t\nPHL \nas a function of temperature and voltage for 10k pull-up resistors and 100pF equivalent capacitance on both sides of the part. By comparison with Figure 2, the V\nCC = 3.3V \ncurve shows that increasing the capacitance from 50pF to 100pF results in a t\nPHL increase from 55ns to 75ns. \nLarger output capacitances translate to longer delays (up to 150ns). Users must quantify the difference in propaga-tion times for a rising edge versus a falling edge in their systems and adjust setup and hold times accordingly.\nRise-Time Accelerators\nOnce connection has been established, rise-time accelera-\ntor circuits on all four SDA and SCL pins are activated. These allow the user to choose weaker DC pull-up cur-rents on the bus, reducing power consumption while still meeting system rise-time requirements. During positive bus transitions, the LTC4300A switches in 2mA (typical) of current to quickly slew the SDA and SCL lines once their DC voltages exceed 0.6V. Using a general rule of 20pF of capacitance for every device on the bus (10pF for the device and 10pF for interconnect), choose a pull-up current so that the bus will rise on its own at a rate of at least 1.25V/μs to guarantee activation of the accelerators.\nFor example, assume an SMBus system with V\nCC = 3V, \na 10k pull-up resistor and equivalent bus capacitance of 200pF. The rise-time of an SMBus system is calculated from (V\nIL(MAX)  – 0.15V) to (V IH(MIN)  + 0.15V), or 0.65V \nto 2.25V. It takes an RC circuit 0.92 time constants to traverse this voltage for a 3V supply; in this case, 0.92 • (10k • 200pF) = 1.84μs. Thus, the system exceeds the maximum allowed rise-time of 1μs by 84%. However, using the rise-time accelerators, which are activated at a \nDC threshold of below 0.65V, the worst-case rise-time is: (2.25V – 0.65V) • 200pF/1mA = 320ns, which meets the 1μs rise-time requirement.\nREADY Digital Output (LTC4300A-1)\nThis pin provides a digital flag which is low when either \nENABLE is low or the start-up sequence described earlier in this section has not been completed. READY goes high when ENABLE is high and start-up is complete. The pin is driven by an open drain pull-down capable of sinking 3mA while holding 0.4V on the pin. Connect a resistor of 10k to V\nCC to provide the pull-up. This feature is available \nfor the LTC4300A-1 only. \nENABLE Low Current Disable (LTC4300A-1)\nGrounding the ENABLE pin disconnects the backplane side \nfrom the card side, disables the rise-time accelerators, drives READY low, disables the bus precharge circuitry and puts the part in a near-zero current state. When the pin voltage is driven all the way to V\nCC, the part waits for \ndata transactions on both the backplane and card sides to be complete (as described in the Start-Up section) before reconnecting the two sides. This feature is available for the LTC4300A-1 only.\nACC Boost Current Enable (LTC4300A-2)\nUsers having lightly loaded systems may wish to disable \nthe rise-time accelerators. Driving this pin to ground turns off the rise-time accelerators on all four SDA and SCL pins. Driving this pin to the V\nCC2 voltage enables normal \noperation of the rise-time accelerators, as described in the Rise-Time Accelerators section above. This feature is available for the LTC4300A-2 only.Figure 1. Input–Output Connection t PLH Figure 2.

Choose maximum resistor value R using the formula:\n R ≤ (V\nCC(MIN)  – 0.6) (800,000) / C\nwhere R is the pull-up resistor value in ohms, V CC(MIN)  \nis the minimum V CC voltage and C is the equivalent bus \ncapacitance in picofarads (pF).In addition, regardless of the bus capacitance, always \nchoose R ≤ 16k for V CC = 5.5V maximum, R ≤ 24k for \nVCC\xa0 =\xa0 3.6V maximum. The start-up circuitry requires \nlogic high voltages on SDAOUT and SCLOUT to connect the backplane to the card, and these pull-up values are needed to overcome the precharge voltage. \nLive Insertion and Capacitance Buffering Application\nFigures 3 through 6 illustrate the usage of the LTC4300A \nin applications that take advantage of both its hot swap controlling and capacitance buffering features.

Placing a LTC4300A on the edge of each card, however, isolates the card capacitance from the backplane. For a given I/O card, the LTC4300A drives the capacitance of everything on the card and the backplane must drive only the capacitance of the LTC4300A, which is less than 10pF. \nFigure 3 shows the LTC4300A-1 in a CompactPCI configu-\nration. Connect V\nCC and ENABLE to the output of one of \nthe CompactPCI power supply Hot Swap circuits. Use a pull-up resistor to ENABLE for a card side enable/disable. V\nCC is monitored by a filtered UVLO circuit. With the V CC \nvoltage powering up after all other pins have established connection, the UVLO circuit ensures that the backplane and card data and clock busses are not connected until the transients associated with live insertion have settled. Owing to their small capacitance, the SDAIN and SCLIN pins cause minimal disturbance on the backplane busses when they make contact with the connector.\nFigure 4 shows the LTC4300A-2 in a CompactPCI con-figuration. The LTC4300A-2 receives its V\nCC voltage from \none of the long “early power” pins. Because this power is not switched, add a 5Ω to 10Ω resistor between the V\nCC \npins of the connector and the LTC4300A-2, as shown in \nFigure 4.

In addition, make sure that the V CC bypassing \non the backplane is large compared to the 0.01μF bypass capacitor on the card. Establishing early power V\nCC \nensures that the 1V precharge voltage is present at the SDAIN and SCLIN pins before they make contact. Con-nect V\nCC2 to the output of one of the CompactPCI power \nsupply Hot Swap circuits. V CC2 is monitored by a filtered \nUVLO circuit. With the V CC2 voltage powering up after all \nother pins have established connection, the UVLO circuit ensures that the backplane and card data and clock busses are not connected until the transients associated with live insertion have settled.\nFigure 5 shows the LTC4300A-1 in a PCI application, \nwhere all of the pins have the same length. In this case, connect an RC series circuit on the I/O card between V\nCC \nand ENABLE. An RC product of 10ms provides a filter to prevent the LTC4300A-1 from becoming activated until the transients associated with live insertion have settled.\nFigure 5. Inserting Multiple I/O Cards into a Live Backplane Using the LTC4300A-1 in a PCI SystemFigure 6 shows the LTC4300A-2 in an application where the user has a custom connector with pins of three different lengths available. Making V\nCC2 the shortest pin ensures \nthat all other pins are firmly connected before V CC2 receives \nany voltage. A filtered UVLO circuit on V CC2 ensures that \nthe V CC2 pin is firmly connected before the LTC4300A-2 \nconnects the backplane to the card.\nRepeater/Bus Extender Application\nUsers who wish to connect two 2-wire systems separated \nby a distance can do so by connecting two LTC4300A-1s back-to-back, as shown in Figure 7. The I\n2C specification \nallows for 400pF maximum bus capacitance, severely limiting the length of the bus. The SMBus specification places no restriction on bus capacitance, but the limited impedances of devices connected to the bus require systems to remain small if rise- and fall-time specifica-tions are to be met. The strong pull-up and pull-down impedances of the LTC4300A-1 are capable of meeting \nR3\n100k\nENABLE\nSDAIN\nSCLINVCC\nGNDSDAOUT\nSCLOUT\nREADYENABLE\nSDAIN\nSCLINVCC\nGNDSDAOUT\nSCLOUT\nREADY\n4300a12 F05R9\n10kR810kR10\n10kI/O PERIPHERAL CARD 2\nU2\nL TC4300A-1CARD2_SCLCARD2_SDAR5\n10kR410kI/O PERIPHERAL CARD 1\nU1\nL TC4300A-1\nC2 0.1μF\nR7100k\nC4 0.1μFCARD_SCLCARD_SDAR1\n10kVCC\nR2\n10kBACKPLANEBACKPLANE\nCONNECTOR\nSDA\nSCLC10.01μF\nC30.01μFR610k\ntttAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC4300A-1/LTC4300A-2\n134300a12faFigure 6.

In this situation, the differential ground voltage between the two systems may limit the allowed distance, because a valid logic low voltage with respect to the ground at one end of the system may violate the allowed V\nOL specification \nwith respect to the ground at the other end. In addition, the connection circuitry offset voltages of the back-to-back LTC4300A-1s add together, directly contributing to the same problem.\nSystems with Disparate Supply Voltages (LTC4300A-1)\nIn large 2-wire systems, the V\nCC voltages seen by devices \nat various points in the system can differ by a few hun-dred millivolts or more. This situation is well modelled by a series resistor in the V\nCC line, as shown in Figure 8. \nFor proper operation of the LTC4300A-1, make sure that V\nCC(BUS)  ≥ V CC(LTC4300A)  – 0.5V.5V to 3.3V Level T ranslator and Power Supply \nRedundancy (LTC4300A-2)\nSystems requiring different supply voltages for the back-\nplane side and the card side can use the LTC4300A-2, as shown in Figure 9. The pull-up resistors on the card side connect from SDAOUT to SCLOUT to V\nCC2, and those on \nthe backplane side connect from SDAIN and SCLIN to V CC. \nThe LTC4300A-2 functions for voltages ranging from 2.7V to 5.5V on both V\nCC and V CC2. There is no constraint on \nthe voltage magnitudes of V CC and V CC2 with respect to \neach other.\nThis application also provides power supply redundancy. \nIf the V CC2 voltage falls below its UVLO threshold, the \nLTC4300A-2 disconnects the backplane from the card, so that the backplane can continue to function. If the V \nCC \nvoltage falls below its UVLO threshold and the V CC2 volt-\nage remains active, ground the ACC pin to ensure proper operation.\nPACKAGE DESCRIPTION\nPlease refer to http://www.linear.com/designtools/packaging/  for the most recent package drawings.\nMSOP (MS8) 0307 REV F 0.53 ±0.152\n(.021 ±.006)\nSEATING\nPLANE\nNOTE:\n1.
