Placing a high-value \nelectrolytic capacit or on the input (10- μF minimum) and output pin(s) is recommended when the output load is heavy. Th is precaution reduces \npower-supply transients that may cause ringing on the input. Additionally, bypassing the output with a 0.01- μF to 0.1- μF ceramic capacitor \nimproves the immunity of the dev ice to short-circuit transients. \n \nOver-Current and Short Circuit Protection  \nAn internal sensing FET is employed to c heck for over-current conditions. Unlike curr ent-sense resistors, sense FETs do not inc rease the series \nresistance of the current path. When an overcurrent condition is detected, the device maintains a constant output current and r educes the output \nvoltage accordingly. Complete shutdown occurs only if  the fault stays long enough to activate thermal limiting. \n \nThree possible overload conditions can occur. In the first condition, the output has been shorted to GND before the device is e nabled or before \nVIN has been applied. The AP2101/AP2111 senses the short circuit and immediat ely clamps output current to a certain safe level namely I LIMIT. \n  \nIn the second condition, an output short or an overload occurs while the device is enabl ed.  At the instance the overload occur s, higher current \nmay flow for a very short period of time before the current lim it function can react. After t he current limit function has trip ped (reached the over-\ncurrent trip threshold), the device switches into current limiting mode and the current is clamped at I LIMIT. \n \nIn the third condition, the load has been gradually increased be yond the recommended operating current. The current is permitte d to rise until the \ncurrent-limit threshold (I TRIG) is reached or until the thermal limit of the device is  exceeded. The AP2101/AP2111 is capable of delivering current \nup to the current-limit threshold without damaging the device. On ce the threshold has been reached, the device switches into it s current limiting \nmode and is set at I LIMIT. \n \nTo protect against short circuit to GND at extr emely low temperature (< -30°C), a minimum 120- μF electrolytic capacitor on the output pin is \nrecommended.  A correct capacitor type with capacitor voltage rati ng and temperature characteristics must be properly chosen so  that \ncapacitance value does not drop too low at the extremely low te mperature operation.  A recomm ended capacitor should have temper ature \ncharacteristics of less than 10% variati on of capacitance change when operated at extr emely low temp.  Our recommended aluminum  electrolytic \ncapacitor type is Panasonic FC series. \n \nAt low input voltage condition (V IN < 3V), the short circuit protection current ma y rise as high as twice the typical value.  \n  \nFLG Response  \nWhen an over-current or over-temperature shutdown condition is encountered, the FLG open -drain output goes active low after a n ominal 7-ms \ndeglitch timeout.  The FLG output remains low until both over-curr ent and over-temperature conditions are removed. Connecting a  heavy \ncapacitive load to the output of the device can cause a momentary over-current conditi on, which does not trigger the FLG due to  the 7-ms deglitch \ntimeout. The AP2101/AP2111 is designed to elimi nate false over-current reporting without the need of external components to rem ove unwanted \npulses. \n \nPower Dissipation and Junction Temperature \nThe low on-resistance of the internal MOSFET  allows the small surface-mount packages to pass large current. Using the maximum o perating \nambient temperature (T A) and R DS(ON) , the power dissipation can be calculated by: \nPD = R DS(ON) × I2 \nFinally, calculate the junction temperature: \nTJ = P D x R θJA + T A \nWhere: \nTA= Ambient temperature °C \nRθJA = Thermal resistance \nPD = Total power dissipation \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nAP2101/AP2111  \nDocument number: DS32015 Rev. 3 - 2  10 of 14 \nwww.diodes.com  January 2013\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2101/AP2111\n \n \n \n \nApplication Information (cont.) \nThermal Protection  \nThermal protection prevents the IC from damage when heavy-overload or short-circuit faults are present for extended periods of time. The \nAP2101/AP2111 implements a thermal sensing to monitor the operati ng junction temperature of the power distribution switch. Once  the die \ntemperature rises to approximately 140°C due to excessive power di ssipation in an over-current or  short-circuit condition the i nternal thermal \nsense circuitry turns the power switch off, thus preventing the power switch from damage.  Hysteresis is built into the thermal sense circuit allowing \nthe device to cool down approximately 25°C before the switch turn s back on. The switch continues to cycle in this manner until the load fault or \ninput power is removed. The FLG open-drain output is asserted when an over-temperature shutdown or over-current occurs with 7-m s deglitch. \n \nUnder-Voltage Lockout (UVLO)  \nUnder-voltage lockout function (UVL O) keeps the internal power switch from bei ng turned on until the power supply has reached a t least 1.9V, \neven if the switch is enabled. Whenever the input voltage falls below approximately 1.9V, the power switch is quickly turned of f. This facilitates the \ndesign of hot-insertion systems where it is  not possible to turn off the power switch before input power is removed.  \n \nHost/Self-Powered HUBs \nHosts and self-powered hubs (SPH) have a local power supply that powers the embedded functions and the downstream ports. This p ower supply \nmust provide from 5.25V to 4.75V to the board side of the downstream connection under both full-load and no-load conditions. Ho sts and SPHs \nare required to have current-limit protection and must report ov er-current conditions to the USB controller. Typical SPHs are d esktop PCs, \nmonitors, printers, and stand-alone hubs. \n \nGeneric Hot-Plug Applications  \nIn many applications it may be necessary to remove modules or pc boards while the main unit is  still operating. These are consi dered hot-plug \napplications. Such implementations require th e control of current surges seen by the main power supply and the card being inser ted. The most \neffective way to control these surges is to limit and slowly  ramp the current and voltage being applied to the card, similar to  the way in which a \npower supply normally turns on. Due to the controlled rise times and fall times of the AP2101/AP2111, these devices can be used  to provide a \nsofter start-up to devices being hot-plugged into a powered system. The UVLO feature of the AP2101/AP2111 also ensures that the  switch is off \nafter the card has been removed, and that the switch is off during the next insertion.  \n \nBy placing the AP2101/AP2111 between the VCC input and the rest of t he circuitry, the input power reaches these devices first a fter insertion. \nThe typical rise time of the switch is approximately 1ms, provid ing a slow voltage ramp at the output of the device. This imple mentation controls \nsystem surge current and provides a hot-plugging mechanism for any device. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \nO\nM\n \nAP2101/AP 2\nDocument numbe r\n \n \n \n \n \nOrdering I n\n \n \n \nPart Nu m\nAP21X1 S\nAP21X1M P\n \n \nMarking In f\n(1) SO-8 \n(2) MSOP-8 E\n2111  \nr: DS32015 Rev. 3 \nnformatio n\nmber P\nSG-13 \nPG-13 \nformation \nPart\n6 : A\n7 : A\nEP \nPar\n6 : A\n7 : A\n- 2 n \nPackage Code \nS \nMP \nt Numbe rLogo\nActive Lo w\nActive High\nrt NumberLogo\nActive Low\nActive High\nwPackagi n\nSO-8\nMSOP-8 E\n AP2 1( Top\nYY W\n87\n1 2\n AP21( Top V\n87\n1 2\n11 of 14 \nwww.diodes.cong \nEP \n \n1X X D p View )\nWW X X65\n34\n \n \n \nX X DView )\nY W X E65\n34\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nm  Quantit y\n2500/Tape & \n2500/Tape & \nWW : WeYY : Yea r\nG : Gree nX : Intern a1 : 1 Cha n\nrepresen t\nY : Year : 0 ~A~Z : Gree n\n1 : 1 ChannA~Z : 27~5 2W : Week : \n52 and 53 wMSOP-8-E P\n13” Tape a n\ny \nReel \nReel \nek : 01~52; 5 2r : 08, 09,10~\nnal Codennel\nts 52 and 53 w\n~9n\nel2 week; Z rep ra~z : 1~26 we\nweekP\nAP2101/ A\n \nnd Reel \nPart Num b\n-1\n-1\n2\n week\n \nresents ek;\n \nJanuary 201\n© Diodes Incorporat eAP2111\nber Suffix \n3 \n3 \n3\ned \n \nAP2101/AP2111  \nDocument number: DS32015 Rev. 3 - 2  12 of 14 \nwww.diodes.com  January 2013\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2101/AP2111\n \n \n \n  \n \nPackage Outline Dimensions (All dimensions in mm.)   \n Please see AP02002 at http://www.diodes.com /datasheets/ap02002.pdf for latest version.  \n \n(1) SO-8 \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n(2) MSOP-8EP \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  SO-8 \nDim Min Max \nA - 1.75 \nA1 0.10 0.20 \nA2 1.30 1.50 \nA3 0.15 0.25 \nb 0.3 0.5 \nD 4.85 4.95 \nE 5.90 6.10 \nE1 3.85 3.95 \ne 1.27 Typ \nh - 0.35 \nL 0.62 0.82 \nθ 0° 8 ° \nAll Dimensions in mm \nMSOP-8EP \nDim Min Max Typ \nA - 1.10 - \nA1 0.05 0.15 0.10 \nA2 0.75 0.95 0.86 \nA3 0.29 0.49 0.39 \nb 0.22 0.38 0.30 \nc 0.08 0.23 0.15 \nD 2.90 3.10 3.00 \nD1 1.60 2.00 1.80 \nE 4.70 5.10 4.90 \nE1 2.90 3.10 3.00 \nE2 1.30 1.70 1.50 \nE3 2.85 3.05 2.95 \ne - - 0.65 \nL 0.40 0.80 0.60 \na 0° 8° 4° \nx - - 0.750 \ny - - 0.750 \nAll Dimensions in mm  \nGauge Plane\nSeating Plane\nDetail ‘A’\nDetail ‘A’E E1\nhL\nDe bA2A1\nA45°7°~9°\nA3\n0.254\n1\nDAA1\nA2E\neyx\nSeating PlaneGauge Plane\nLD\n8Xb\nSee Detail CDetail C\nca\nE1E3\nA3E24X10°\n4X10°0.25D1\n \nAP2101/AP2111  \nDocument number: DS32015 Rev. 3 - 2  13 of 14 \nwww.diodes.com  January 2013\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2101/AP2111\n \n \n \n  \n \nSuggested Pad Layout  \n Please see AP02001 at http://www.diodes.com/dat asheets/ap02001.pdf for the latest version. \n \n(1) SO-8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(2) MSOP-8-EP \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n Dimensions Value (in mm) \nX 0.60 \nY 1.55 \nC1 5.4 \nC2 1.27 \nDimensions Value \n(in mm) \nC 0.650 \nG 0.450 \nX 0.450 \nX1 2.000 \nY 1.350 \nY1 1.700 \nY2 5.300 X\nC1\nC2\nY\nGX C\nY\nY2 Y1\nX1\n \nAP2101/AP2111  \nDocument number: DS32015 Rev. 3 - 2  14 of 14 \nwww.diodes.com  January 2013\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AP2101/AP2111\n \n \n \n \n \nIMPORTANT NOTICE \n \nDIODES INCORPORATED MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARDS TO THIS DOCUMENT, \nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE \n(AND THEIR EQUIVALENTS UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION).   \n \nDiodes Incorporated and its subsidiaries rese rve the right to make modifications, enhanc ements, improvements, corrections or ot her changes \nwithout further notice to this document and any product descri bed herein.
