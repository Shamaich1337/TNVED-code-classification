These devices\nperform the same electronic adjustment function as mechanical\npotentiometers or variable resistors, with enhanced resolution, sol-\nid-state reliability, and superior low temperature coefficient perform-\nance.\nThe wiper settings are controllable through an I2C-compatible digital\ninterface, which can also be used to read back the wiper register\ncontent. AD0 can be used to place up to two devices on the same\nbus. Command bits are available to reset the wiper position to\nmidscale or to shut down the device into a state of zero power\nconsumption.\nOperating from a 2.7 V to 5.5 V power supply and consuming less\nthan 8 µA allows usage in portable battery-operated applications.\nNote that the terms digital potentiometer, VR, and RDAC are used\ninterchangeably.\nData Sheet AD5245\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

C | 14 of 19The AD5245  is a 256-position digitally controlled variable resistor\n(VR) device.\nAn internal power-on preset places the wiper at midscale during\npower-on, which simplifies the fault condition recovery at power-up.\nPROGRAMMING THE VARIABLE RESISTOR\nRheostat Operation\nThe nominal resistance of the RDAC between Terminals A and\nB is available in 5 k Ω, 10 k Ω, 50 k Ω, and 100 k Ω. The nominal\nresistance (RAB) of the VR has 256 contact points accessed by the\nwiper terminal, plus the B terminal contact. The 8-bit data in the\nRDAC latch is decoded to select one of the 256 possible settings.\nFigure 35. Rheostat Mode Configuration\nAssuming that a 10 k Ω part is used, the wiper’s first connection\nstarts at the B terminal for Data 0x00. Because there is a 50 Ω\nwiper contact resistance, such a connection yields a minimum of\n100 Ω (2 × 50 Ω ) resistance between Terminals W and B. The\nsecond connection is the first tap point, which corresponds to 139\nΩ (RWB = RAB/256 + 2 × RW = 39 Ω + 2 × 50 Ω ) for Data 0x01.\nThe third connection is the next tap point, representing 178 Ω (2 ×\n39 Ω + 2 × 50 Ω ) for Data 0x02, and so on. Each LSB data value\nincrease moves the wiper up the resistor ladder until the last tap\npoint is reached at 10,061 Ω (RAB − 1 LSB + 2 × RW).\nFigure 36. AD5245  Equivalent RDAC Circuit\nThe general equation determining the digitally programmed output\nresistance between W and B is\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 R W B D =D\n256× R AB + 2 × R W (1)\nwhere:\nD is the decimal equivalent of the binary code loaded in the 8-bit\nRDAC register.\nRAB is the end-to-end resistance.RW is the wiper resistance contributed by the on resistance of the\ninternal switch.\nIn summary, if RAB = 10 k Ω and the A terminal is open circuited,\nthen the following output resistance RWB is set for the indicated\nRDAC latch codes.\nTable 8. Codes and Corresponding RWB Resistance\nD (Dec.) RWB (Ω) Output State\n255 10,061 Full scale (RAB – 1 LSB + 2 × RW)\n128 5100 Midscale\n1 139 1 LSB\n0 100 Zero scale (wiper contact resistance)\nNote that in the zero-scale condition, a finite wiper resistance of\n100 Ω is present. Care should be taken to limit the current flow\nbetween W and B in this state to a maximum pulse current of no\nmore than 20 mA. Otherwise, degradation or possible destruction of\nthe internal switch contact can occur.\nSimilar to the mechanical potentiometer, the resistance of the\nRDAC between the Wiper W and Terminal A also produces a\ndigitally controlled complementary resistance, RWA. When these\nterminals are used, the B terminal can be opened. Setting the\nresistance value for RWA starts at a maximum value of resistance\nand decreases as the data loaded in the latch increases in value.\nThe general equation for this operation is\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 R W A D =256 − D\n256× R AB + 2 × R W (2)\nFor RAB = 10 k Ω and the B terminal open circuited, the following\noutput resistance RWA is set for the indicated RDAC latch codes.\nTable 9.

RWA (Ω) Output State\n255 139 Full scale\n128 5100 Midscale\n1 10,061 1 LSB\n0 10,100 Zero scale\nTypical device-to-device matching is process lot dependent and can\nvary by up to ±30%. Because the resistance element is processed\nin thin film technology, the change in RAB with temperature has a\nvery low 45 ppm/°C temperature coefficient.\nPROGRAMMING THE POTENTIOMETER\nDIVIDER\nVoltage Output Operation\nThe digital potentiometer easily generates a voltage divider at\nwiper-to-B and wiper-to-A proportional to the input voltage at A to B.\nUnlike the polarity of VDD to GND, which must be positive, voltage\nacross A to B, W to A, and W to B can be at either polarity.\nData Sheet AD5245\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. C | 15 of 19Figure 37. Potentiometer Mode Configuration\nIf ignoring the effect of the wiper resistance for approximation, then\nconnecting the A terminal to 5 V and the B terminal to ground\nproduces an output voltage at the wiper-to-B starting at 0 V up to\n1 LSB less than 5 V. Each LSB of voltage is equal to the voltage\napplied across Terminal A and B divided by the 256 positions of\nthe potentiometer divider. The general equation defining the output\nvoltage at VW with respect to ground for any valid input voltage\napplied to Terminals A and B is\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 V W D =D\n256V A +256 − D\n256V B (3)\nA more accurate calculation, which includes the effect of wiper\nresistance, VW, is\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 V W D =R W B D\nR A BV A +R W A D\nR ABV B (4)\nOperation of the digital potentiometer in the divider mode results\nin a more accurate operation over temperature. Unlike the rheostat\nmode, the output voltage is dependent mainly on the ratio of the\ninternal resistors, RWA and RWB, not the absolute values. Therefore,\nthe temperature drift reduces to 15 ppm/°C.\nESD PROTECTION\nAll digital inputs are protected with a series of input resistors and\nparallel Zener ESD structures, shown in Figure 38  and Figure 39 .\nThis applies to the digital input pins SDA, SCL, and AD0.\nFigure 38. ESD Protection of Digital Pins\nFigure 39. ESD Protection of Resistor Terminals\nTERMINAL VOLTAGE OPERATING RANGE\nThe AD5245  VDD and GND power supply defines the boundary\nconditions for proper 3-terminal digital potentiometer operation.\nSupply signals present on Terminals A, B, and W that exceed VDD\nor GND are clamped by the internal forward-biased diodes (see\nFigure 40 ).Figure 40. Maximum Terminal Voltages Set by VDD and GND\nPOWER-UP SEQUENCE\nBecause the ESD protection diodes limit the voltage compliance at\nTerminals A, B, and W (see Figure 40 ), it is important to power VDD\nand GND before applying any voltage to Terminals A, B, and W;\notherwise, the diode is forward biased such that VDD is powered\nunintentionally and can affect the rest of the user’s circuit. The\nideal power-up sequence is in the following order: GND, VDD, digital\ninputs, and then VA, VB, and VW. The relative order of powering VA,\nVB, VW, and the digital inputs is not important as long as they are\npowered after VDD and GND.\nLAYOUT AND POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING\nIt is good practice to employ compact, minimum lead length layout\ndesign. The leads to the inputs should be as direct as possible\nwith a minimum conductor length. Ground paths should have low\nresistance and low inductance.\nSimilarly, it is also good practice to bypass the power supplies with\nquality capacitors for optimum stability. Supply leads to the device\nshould be bypassed with disk or chip ceramic capacitors of 0.01 µF\nto 0.1 µF. Low ESR 1 µF to 10 µF tantalum or electrolytic capacitors\nshould also be applied at the supplies to minimize any transient\ndisturbance and low frequency ripple (see Figure 41 ). Note that the\ndigital ground should also be joined remotely to the analog ground\nat one point to minimize the ground bounce.\nFigure 41. Power Supply Bypassing\nCONSTANT BIAS TO RETAIN RESISTANCE\nSETTING\nFor users who desire nonvolatility but cannot justify the additional\ncost for the EEMEM, the AD5245  can be considered a low cost al-\nternative by maintaining a constant bias to retain the wiper setting.\nThe AD5245  is designed specifically with low power in mind, which\nallows low power consumption even in battery-operated systems.\nFigure 42  demonstrates the power consumption from a 3.4 V, 450\nmA-hr Li-Ion cell phone battery that is connected to the AD5245 .\nThe measurement over time shows that the device draws approxi-\nData Sheet AD5245\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. C | 16 of 19mately 1.3 µA and consumes negligible power. Over a course of 30\ndays, the battery is depleted by less than 2%, the majority of which\nis due to the intrinsic leakage current of the battery itself.\nFigure 42. Battery Operating Life Depletion\nThis demonstrates that constantly biasing the potentiometer can\nbe a practical approach. Most portable devices do not require the\nremoval of batteries for charging.\nAlthough the resistance setting of the AD5245  is lost when the\nbattery needs replacement, such events occur rather infrequently\nso that this inconvenience is justified by the lower cost and smaller\nsize offered by the AD5245 . If total power is lost, then the user\nshould be provided with a means to adjust the setting accordingly.\nEVALUATION BOARD\nAn evaluation board, along with all necessary software, is avail-\nable to program the AD5245  from any PC running Windows®\n98/2000/XP. The graphical user interface, as shown in Figure 43 ,\nis straightforward and easy to use. More detailed information is\navailable in the user manual, which is provided with the board.\nFigure 43. AD5245  Evaluation Board Software\nThe AD5245  starts at midscale upon power-up. To increment or\ndecrement the resistance, the user can simply move the scroll-bars\non the left. To write a specific value, the user should use the bit\npattern in the upper screen and click the Run button. The format\nof writing data to the device is shown in Table 10 . To read the data\nfrom the device, the user can simply click the Read  button. The\nformat of the read bits is shown in Table 11 .\nData Sheet AD5245\nI2C INTERFACE\nanalog.com Rev. C | 17 of 19I2C-COMPATIBLE 2-WIRE SERIAL BUS\nThe 2-wire I2C serial bus protocol operates as follows:\n1.The master initiates data transfer by establishing a START\ncondition, which is when a high-to-low transition on the SDA\nline occurs while SCL is high (see Figure 44 ). The next byte\nis the slave address byte, which consists of the 7-bit slave\naddress followed by an R/ W bit (this bit determines whether\ndata is read from or written to the slave device). The AD5245\nhas one configurable address bit, AD0 (see Table 10 ).\nThe slave whose address corresponds to the transmitted ad-\ndress responds by pulling the SDA line low during the ninth\nclock pulse (this is termed the acknowledge bit). At this stage,\nall other devices on the bus remain idle while the selected\ndevice waits for data to be written to or read from its serial\nregister. If the R/ W bit is high, the master reads from the slave\ndevice. On the other hand, if the R/ W bit is low, the master\nwrites to the slave device.\n2.In write mode, the second byte is the instruction byte. The first\nbit (MSB) of the instruction byte is a don’t care.\nThe second MSB, RS, is the midscale reset. A logic high on\nthis bit moves the wiper to the center tap, where RWA = RWB.\nThis feature effectively overwrites the contents of the register;\ntherefore, when taken out of reset mode, the RDAC remains at\nmidscale.\nThe third MSB, SD, is a shutdown bit. A logic high causes\nan open circuit at Terminal A while shorting the wiper to Ter-\nminal B. This operation yields almost 0 Ω in rheostat mode\nor 0 V in potentiometer mode. It is important to note that\nthe shutdown operation does not disturb the contents of the\nregister. When brought out of shutdown, the previous setting is\napplied to the RDAC. Also during shutdown, new settings can\nbe programmed. When the part is returned from shutdown, the\ncorresponding VR setting is applied to the RDAC.\nThe remainder of the bits in the instruction byte are don’t cares\n(see Table 10 ).\n3.After acknowledging the instruction byte, the last byte in write\nmode is the data byte. Data is transmitted over the serial bus in\nsequences of nine clock pulses (eight data bits followed by an\nacknowledge bit). The transitions on the SDA line must occurduring the low period of SCL and remain stable during the high\nperiod of SCL (see Figure 44 ).\n4.In read mode, the data byte follows immediately after the\nacknowledgment of the slave address byte. Data is transmitted\nover the serial bus in sequences of nine clock pulses (a slight\ndifference with write mode, in which eight data bits are followed\nby an acknowledge bit). Similarly, the transitions on the SDA\nline must occur during the low period of SCL and remain stable\nduring the high period of SCL (see Figure 45 ).\n5.After all data bits have been read or written, a STOP condition\nis established by the master. A STOP condition is defined as\na low-to-high transition on the SDA line while SCL is high. In\nwrite mode, the master pulls the SDA line high during the 10th\nclock pulse to establish a STOP condition (see Figure 44 ). In\nread mode, the master issues a no acknowledge for the ninth\nclock pulse (that is, the SDA line remains high). The master\nthen brings the SDA line low before the 10th clock pulse, which\ngoes high to establish a STOP condition (see Figure 45 ).\nA repeated write function gives the user flexibility to update\nthe RDAC output a number of times after addressing and\ninstructing the part only once. For example, after the RDAC\nhas acknowledged its slave address and instruction bytes in the\nwrite mode, the RDAC output updates on each successive byte.\nIf different instructions are needed, then the write/read mode\nhas to start again with a new slave address, instruction, and\ndata byte. Similarly, a repeated read function of the RDAC is\nalso allowed.\nS = START condition\nP = STOP condition\nA = Acknowledge\nX = Don’t care\nW = Write\nR = Read\nRS = Reset wiper to midscale 0x80\nSD = Shutdown connects wiper to B terminal and open circuits A\nterminal, but does not change contents of wiper register\nD7, D6, D5, D4, D3, D2, D1, D0 = Data Bits\nTable 10.
