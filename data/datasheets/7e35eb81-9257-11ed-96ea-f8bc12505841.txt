It reduces boa rd cost and simplifies board layout by using on-chip  \ntermination resistors for the differential pairs and by inte grating a low-noise regulator to supply the 1.2V core.\nThe KSZ8081MNX offers the Media Independent Interface (MII)  and  the KSZ8081RNB offers the Reduced Media Inde -\npendent Interface (RMII) for direct connection with MII/ RMII-compl iant Ethernet MAC processors and switches.\nA 25  MHz crystal is used to generate al l required clocks, inc luding the 50  MHz RMII reference clock output for the  \nKSZ80\n81RNB.\nThe KSZ8081 provides diagnostic features to facilitate system b ring-up and debugging in production testing and in prod -\nuct deployment. Parametric NAND tree support enables fault detection between KSZ8081 I/Os and the board. LinkMD®\nTDR-based cable diagnostics identify faulty copper cabling. \nThe KSZ8081MNX and KSZ8081RNB are available in 32-pin, lead-free QFN packages.\nFIGURE 1-1: FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM\n\n\uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

DS00002202B-page  15KSZ8081MNX/RNB\n3.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\n3.1 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX Transceiver\nThe KSZ8081 is an in tegrated single 3.3V  supply Fast Ethernet transceiver. It is fully compliant with the IEEE 802.3  \nSpecification, and reduces board cost and simplifies board la yout by using on-chip termination resistors for the two dif -\nferential pairs and by integrating the regulator to supply the 1.2V core.\nOn the copper media side, the KSZ8081 sup ports 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX for tr ansmission and reception of data  \nover a standard CAT-5 unshielded twist ed pair (UTP) cable, and HP Auto MDI/MDI–X for reliable detection of and cor -\nrection for straight-through and crossover cables.\nOn the MAC processor side, the KSZ8081MNX offers t he Media Independent Interfac e (MII) and the KSZ8081RNB  \noffers the Reduced Media Independent Inte rface (RMII) for direct connection wit h MII and RMII compliant Ethernet MAC  \nprocessors and switches, respectively.\nThe MII management bus option gives the MAC processor co mplete access to the KSZ8081 control and status regis -\nters. Additionally, an interrupt pin eliminates the need for the processor to poll for PHY status change.\nThe KSZ8081MNX/RNB is used to refer to both KS Z8081MNX and KSZ8081RNB versions in this datasheet.\n3.1.1 100BASE-TX TRANSMIT\nThe 100BASE-TX transmit function performs parallel-to-seria l conversion, 4B/5B encodi ng, scrambling, NRZ-to-NRZI  \nconversion, and MLT3 encoding and transmission. \nThe circuitry starts with a parallel-to-serial conversion , which converts the MII data from the MAC into a 125  MHz serial  \nbit stream. The data and control stream is then converte d into 4B/5B coding and followed by a scrambler. The serialized  \ndata is further converted from NRZ-to-NR ZI format, and then transmitted in ML T3 current output. The output current is  \nset by an external 6.49  kΩ 1% resistor for the 1:1 transformer ratio. \nThe output signal has a typical rise/fall time of 4  ns and complies with the ANSI TP-PMD standard regarding amplitude  \nbalance, overshoot, and timing jitter. The wave-shaped 10 BASE-T output is also incorporated into the 100BASE-TX  \ntransmitter.\n3.1.2 100BASE-TX RECEIVE\nThe 100BASE-TX receiver func tion performs adaptive equ alization, DC restoration, MLT3 -to-NRZI conversion, data and  \nclock recovery, NRZI-to-NRZ conversi on, de-scrambling, 4B/5B decoding, and serial-to-parallel conversion. \nThe receiving side starts with the equaliz ation filter to compensate for inter-symbol  interference (ISI) over the twisted  \npair cable. Because the amplitude loss and phase distortion is  a function of the cable length, the equalizer must adjust  \nits characteristics to optimize performance.  In this design, the variable equalizer makes an initial estimation based on  \ncomparisons of incoming signal strength a gainst some known cable characteristics, then tunes itself for optimization.  \nThis is an ongoing process and self-adjusts against environmental changes such as temperature variations.\nNext, the equalized signal goes through a DC-restoration a nd data-conversion block. The DC-restoration circuit com -\npensates for the effect of baseline wander and improves the dynamic range. The differential data-conversion circuit con -\nverts MLT3 format back to NRZI. The slicing threshold is also adaptive.\nThe clock-recovery circuit extracts the 125  MHz clock from the edges of the NRZI signal. This recovered clock is then  \nused to convert the NRZI signal to NRZ format. This signal  is sent through the de-scrambler, then the 4B/5B decoder.  \nFinally, the NRZ serial data is converted to MII format and provided as the input data to the MAC.\n3.1.3 SCRAMBLER/DE-SCRAMBLER (100BASE-TX ONLY)\nThe scrambler spreads the power spectrum of the transmitted signal to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and  \nbaseline wander. The de-scrambler recovers the scrambled signal.\n3.1.4 10BASE-T TRANSMIT\nThe 10BASE-T drivers are incorporated wi th the 100BASE-TX drivers to allow for transmission using the same mag -\nnetic. The drivers perform internal wa ve shaping and pre-emphas is, and output 10BASE-T signals with a typical ampli -\ntude of 2.5V peak. The 10BASE- T signals have harmonic cont ents that are at least 27  dB below the fundamental  \nfrequency when driven by an all-ones Manchester-encoded signal.\nKSZ8081MNX/RNB\nDS00002202B-page  16  \uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.3.1.5 10BASE-T RECEIVE\nOn the receive side, input buffer and level detecting squelch circuits are used. A differential input receiver circuit and a  \nphase-locked loop (PLL) performs the de coding function. The Manchester-encoded data stream is separated into clock  \nsignal and NRZ data. A squelch circuit rejects signals with levels less than 400  mV, or with short pulse widths, to prevent  \nnoise at the RXP and RXM inputs from falsely triggering the decoder. When the input exceeds the squelch limit, the PLL  \nlocks onto the incoming signal  and the KSZ8081MNX /RNB decodes a data frame. The receive clock is kept active  \nduring idle periods between data receptions.\n3.1.6 SQE AND JABBER F UNCTION (10BASE-T ONLY)\nIn 10BASE-T operation, a short pu lse is put out on the COL pin after each fr ame is transmitted. This SQE test is needed  \nto test the 10BASE-T transmit/rece ive path. If transmit enable (TXEN) is high for more than 20  ms (jabbering), the  \n10BASE-T transmitter is disabled and CO L is asserted high. If TXEN is th en driven low for more than 250  ms, the  \n10BASE-T transmitter is re-enabled and CO L is de-asserted (returns to low).\n3.1.7 PLL CLOCK SYNTHESIZER\nThe KSZ8081MNX/RNB generates all internal clocks and all external clocks for syst em timing from an external 25  MHz \ncrystal, oscillator, or reference clock. For the KSZ8081RNB in RMII 50  MHz clock mode, these clocks are generated  \nfrom an external 50  MHz oscillator or system clock.\n3.1.8 AUTO-NEGOTIATION\nThe KSZ8081MNX/RNB conforms to  the auto-negotiation protoc ol, defined in Clause 28 of t he IEEE 802.3 Specification. \nAuto-negotiation allows unshielded twisted pair (UTP) link partners to select the highest common mode of operation. \nDuring auto-negotiation, link partners advertise capabilities  across the UTP link to each other and then compare their  \nown capabilities with those they received from their link pa rtners. The highest speed and duplex setting that is common  \nto the two link partners is selected as the mode of operation. \nThe following list shows the speed and duplex opera tion mode from highest to lowest priority.\n• Priority 1: 100BASE-TX, full–duplex\n• Priority 2: 100BASE-TX, half–duplex\n• Priority 3: 10BASE-T, full–duplex\n• Priority 4: 10BASE-T, half–duplex\nIf auto-negotiation is not supported or  the KSZ8081MNX/RNB link partner is forc ed to bypass auto-negotiation, then the  \nKSZ8081MNX/RNB sets its operating mode by observing the signal at its receiver . This is known as parallel detection,  \nwhich allows the KSZ8081MNX/RNB to establ ish a link by listening for a fixed signal protocol in the absence of the auto-\nnegotiation advertisement protocol.\nAuto-negotiation is enabled by either  hardware pin strapping (NWAYEN, Pin 42) or software (Register 0h, Bit [12]). \nBy default, auto-negotiation is enabled after power-up or hardware reset. After that, auto-negotiation can be enabled or  \ndisabled by Register 0h, Bit [12]. If auto-negotiation is disa bled, the speed is set by Register 0h, Bit [13], and the duplex  \nis set by Register 0h, Bit [8].\nThe auto-negotiation link-up process is shown in Figure  3-1.\n\uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

It provides a common interface  \nbetween MII PHYs and MACs, and has the following key characteristics:\n• Pin count is 15 pins (6 pins for data transmission, 7 pins  for data reception, and 2 pins for carrier and collision \uf020\nindication).\n•1 0  Mbps and 100 Mbps data rates are supported at both half- and full-duplex.\n• Data transmission and reception are independ ent and be long to separate signal groups.\n• Transmit data and receive data are each 4 bits wide, a nibble.\nBy default, the KSZ8081MNX is configured to MII mode afte r it is powered up or hardware reset with the following:\nA 25 MHz crystal connected to XI, XO (p ins 9, 8), or an external 25  MHz clock source (oscillator) connected to XI.\nThe CONFIG[2:0] strapping pins (pins 18, 29, 28) set to 000 (default setting).\nKSZ8081MNX/RNB\nDS00002202B-page  18  \uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.3.2.1 MII SIGNAL DEFINITION\nTable 3-1 describes the MII signals.

It is a c ontinuous clock that provides the timing  reference for TXEN and TXD[3:0]. TXC is  \n2.5 MHz for 10  Mbps operation and 25  MHz for 100  Mbps operation.\n3.2.3 TRANSMIT ENABLE (TXEN)\nTXEN indicates that the MAC is presenting nibbles on TXD[3:0] for transmission. It is a sserted synchronously with the  \nfirst nibble of the preamble and remains asserted while all nibbles to be transmitted are presented on the MII. It is  \nnegated before the first TXC following the final nibble of a frame.\nTXEN transitions synchronou sl y with respect to TXC.\n3.2.4 TRANSMIT DATA[3:0] (TXD[3:0])\nTXD[3:0] transitions synchronously with respect to TXC. When TXEN is assert ed, TXD[3:0] are accepted by the PHY  \nfor transmission. TXD[3:0] is 00 to indicate idle when TX EN is de-asserted. Values other  than 00 on TXD[3:0] while  \nTXEN is de-asserted are ignored by the PHY.\n3.2.5 RECEIVE CLOCK (RXC)\nRXC provides the timing referenc e for RXDV, RXD[3:0], and RXER.\n• In 10  Mbps mode, RXC is recovered from the line while the carrier is active. RXC is derived from the PHY’s refer -\nence clock when the line is idle or the link is down.\n• In 100  Mbps mode, RXC is continuously recovered from the line. If th e link is down, RXC is derived from the \nPHY’s reference clock.\nRXC is 2.5  MHz for 10  Mbps operation and 25  MHz for 100  Mbps operation.\n3.2.6 RECEIVE DATA VALID (RXDV)\nRXDV is driven by the PHY to indicate that the PHY is presenting recovered and decoded nibbles on RXD[3:0].\n• In 10  Mbps mode, RXDV is asserted with the first nibble of  th e start-of-frame delimiter (SFD), 5D, and remains \nasserted until the end of the frame.\n• In 100  Mbps mode, RXDV is asserted from the first nibble  of the preamble to the last nibble of the frame.\nRXDV transitions synchronously with respect to RXC.\n\uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

For each clock period in which RXDV is asserted, RXD[3:0]  \ntransfers a nibble of recovered data from the PHY.\n3.2.8 RECEIVE ERROR (RXER)\nRXER is asserted for one or more RXC periods to indicate that a symbol error (for exampl e, a coding error that a PHY  \ncan detect that may otherwise be und etectable by the MAC sub-layer) was de tected somewhere in the frame being  \ntransferred from the PHY.\nRXER transitions synchronously with respect to RXC. While RXDV is de-asserted, RXER has no effect on the MAC.\n3.2.9 CARRIER SENSE (CRS)\nCRS is asserted and de-asserted as follows:\n•I n  1 0  Mbps mode, CRS assertion is based on the reception of valid preambles. CRS de-assertion is based on the \nreceptio\nn of an end-of-frame (EOF) marker.\n• In 100  Mbps mode, CRS is asserted when a start-o f-stream delimiter or /J/K sy mbol pair is detected. CRS is de-\nasserted when an end-of-stream delimiter or /T/R symbol pair is detected. Additionally, the PMA layer de-asserts \nCRS if IDLE symbols are received without /T/R.\n3.2.10 COLLISION (COL)\nCOL is asserted in half-duplex mode whenever the transmitter and receiver are simultaneously active on the line.

It pro -\nvides a common interface between physical layer and MAC laye r devices, and has the following key characteristics:\n• Pin count is 8 pins (3 pins for data transmission, 4 pin s for data reception, and 1 pin for the 50  MHz reference \nclock).\n•1 0  Mbps and 100 Mbps data rates are supported at both half- and full-duplex.\n• Data transmission and reception are independ ent and be long to separate signal groups.\n• Transmit data and receive data are each 2 bits wide, a dibit.\n3.3.1 RMII – 25  MHZ CLOCK MODE\nThe KSZ8081RNB is configured to RMII – 25  MHz clock mode after it is powered up or hardware reset with the following:\n•A  2 5  MHz crystal connected to XI, XO (pins 9, 8), or an external 25  MHz clock source (oscillator) connected to XI.\n• The CONFIG[2:0] strapping pins (pins 18, 29, 28) set to 001.\n• Register 1Fh, Bit [7] is set to 0 (default value) to select 25  MHz clock mode.\n3.3.2 RMII – 50  MHZ CLOCK MODE\nThe KSZ8081RNB is configured to RMII – 50  MHz clock mode after it is powered up or hardware reset with the following:\n• An external 50  MHz clock source (oscillator) connected to XI (Pin 9).\n• The CONFIG[2:0] strapping pins (pins 18, 29, 28) set to 001.\n• Register 1Fh, Bit [7] is set to 1 to select 50  MHz clock mode.\n3.3.3 RMII SIGNAL DEFINITION\nTable 3-2 describes the RMII signals.

DS00002202B-page  21KSZ8081MNX/RNB\n3.3.5 TRANSMIT ENABLE (TXEN)\nTXEN indicates that the MAC is presenti ng dibits on TXD[1:0] for tr ansmission. It is asserted synchronously with the first  \ndibit of the preamble and remains asserted while all dibits  to be transmitted are present ed on the RMII. It is negated  \nbefore the first REF_CLK followin g the final dibit of a frame.\nTXEN transitions synchronousl y with respect to REF_CLK.\n3.3.6 TRANSMIT DATA[1:0] (TXD[1:0])\nTXD[1:0] transitions synchronously with respect to REF_CLK. When TXEN is as serted, the PHY accepts TXD[1:0] for  \ntransmission.\nTXD[1:0] is 00 to indicate idle when TXEN is de-asserted.  The PHY ignores values other than 00 on TXD[1:0] while  \nTXEN is de-asserted.\n3.3.7 CARRIER SENSE/RECEIVE DATA VALID (CRS_DV)\nThe PHY asserts CRS_DV when the receive medium is non-i dle. It is asserted asynchronously when a carrier is  \ndetected. This happens when  squelch is passed in 10  Mbps mode, and when two non-contiguous 0s in 10 bits are  \ndetected in 100  Mbps mode. Loss of carrier results in the de-assertion of CRS_DV.\nWhile carrier detection criteria are met, CRS_DV remains asse rted continuously from the first recovered dibit of the  \nframe through the final recovered dibit. It is negated before  the first REF_CLK that follows the final dibit. The data on  \nRXD[1:0] is considered valid after CRS _DV is asserted. However, because the assertion of CRS_DV is asynchronous  \nrelative to REF_CLK, the data on RXD[1:0] is 00 until receive signals are properly decoded.\n3.3.8 RECEIVE DATA[1:0] (RXD[1:0])\nRXD[1:0] transitions synchronously with respect to REF_ CLK. For each clock period in which CRS_DV is asserted,  \nRXD[1:0] transfers two bits of  recovered data from the PHY.\nRXD[1:0] is 00 to indicate idle when CRS_DV is de-assert ed.

This inte rface allows an upper-layer device, such as a MAC processor, to monitor and  \ncontrol the state of th e KSZ8081MNX/RNB. An external device with MIIM capability is used to read the PHY status and/\nor configure the PHY settings. More det ails about the MIIM interface can be fo und in Clause 22.2.4 of the IEEE 802.3  \nSpecification.\nThe MIIM interface consists of the following:\n• A physical connection that incorporates the clo ck line (MDC) and the data line (MDIO).\n• A specific protocol that operates across the physical conn ection mentioned earlier, which allows the external \uf020\ncontroller to communicate with one or more PHY devices.\n• A set of 16-bit MDIO registers. Regi ste rs [0:8] are standard registers, and their functions are defined in the IEEE \n802.3 Specification. The additi onal registers are provided for expanded functionality. See the “ Register Map ” \uf020\nsection for details.\nAs the default, the KSZ8081MNX/RNB supports unique PHY addr esses 1 to  7, and broadcast PHY address 0. The latter  \nis defined in the IEEE 802.3 Specificat ion, and can be used to read/write to  a single KSZ8081MNX/RNB device, or write  \nto multiple KSZ8081MNX/RNB devices simultaneously.\nPHY address 0 can optionally be disabled as the broadcast a ddress by either hardware pin strapping (B-CAST_OFF,  \nPin 19) or software (Register 16h, Bit [9]), and assigned as a unique PHY address.The PHYAD[2:0] strapping pi n\n s are used to assign a unique PHY address between 0 and 7 to each KSZ8081MNX/RNB  \ndevice.\nThe MIIM interface can operates up to a maximum clock speed of 10  MHz MAC clock.\nTable 3-4 shows the MII management frame format for the KSZ8081MNX/RNB.\nTABLE 3-4:  MII MANAGEMENT FRAME FORMAT FOR THE KSZ8081MNX/RNB\nPreambleStart of \nFr\nameRead/\nWr\nite OP \nCodePHY \nAd\ndress\nBits [4:0]REG \nAddre\nss\nBits [4:0]TAData\nBits [1\n5:0]Idle\nRead 32 1’s 01 10 00AAA RRRRR Z0 DDDDDDDD_DDDDDDDD Z\nWrite 32 1’s 01 01 00AAA RRRRR 10 DDDDDDDD_DDDDDDDD Z\n3.6 Interrupt (INTRP)\nINTRP (Pin 21) is an optional interrupt signal that is used to  inform the external controller  that there has been a status  \nupdate to the KSZ8081MNX/RNB PHY register. Bits [15:8] of Register 1Bh are the interrupt control bits to enable and  \ndisable the conditions for asserting the INTRP signal. Bits [7:0 ] of Register 1Bh are the inte rrupt status bits to indicate  \nwhich interrupt conditions have occurred. The interrupt status bits are cleared after reading Register 1Bh.\nBit [9] of Register 1Fh sets  the interrupt level to active high or active low. The default is active low.\nThe MII management bus option gives the MAC processor comp lete access to the KSZ8081MNX/RNB control and sta-\ntus registers. Additionally, an interrupt pin eliminates th e  need for the processor to poll the PHY for status change.\n3.7 HP Auto MDI/MDI-X\nHP Auto MDI/MDI-X configuration eliminates the need to de cide whether to use a straight cable or a crossover cable  \nbetween the KSZ8081MNX/RNB and its link partner. This feat ure allows the KSZ8081MNX/RNB to use either type of  \ncable to connect with a link par tner that is in either MDI or MDI-X mode. The auto-sense function detects transmit and  \nreceive pairs from the link partner and assigns transmi t and receive pairs to the KSZ8081MNX/RNB accordingly.\nHP Auto MDI/MDI-X is enabled by default. It is disabled by writing a  ‘1’ to Register 1Fh, Bit [13]. MDI and MDI-X mode  \nis selected by Register 1Fh, Bit [14]  if HP Auto MDI/MDI-X is disabled.\nAn isolation transformer with symmetrical transmit and re cei ve data paths is recommended to support Auto MDI/MDI-X.\nTable 3-5 shows how the IEEE 802.3 Standard defines MDI and MDI-X.\nTABLE 3-5: MDI/MDI-X PIN DEFINITION\nMDI MDI-X\nRJ-45 Pin Signal RJ-45 Pin Signal\n1 TX+ 1 RX+\n2 TX– 2 RX–\n3 RX+ 3 TX+\n6 RX– 6 TX–\n\uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.

The MII/RMII MAC transmits frames to the KSZ8081MNX/RNB.\n2. Frames are wrapped around inside the KSZ8081MNX/RNB.\n3. The KSZ8081MNX/RNB tr ans mits frames back to the MII/RMII MAC.\n4.

The time duration for the reflected signal to return provides  \nthe approximate distance to the cabling fault. The LinkMD function processes this TDR information and presents it as  \na numerical value that can be translated to a cable distance.\nLinkMD is initiated by accessing Register 1Dh, the LinkMD Co ntrol/Status register, in conj unction with Register 1Fh, the  \nPHY Control 2 register. The latter register is used to disable Auto MDI/MDI-X and to select either MDI or MDI-X as the  \ncable differential pair for testing.\n3.9.1 USAGE\nThe following is a sample procedure for using LinkMD with Registers 1Dh and 1Fh:\n1. Disable auto MDI/MDI-X by writing a ‘1’ to Register 1Fh, bit [13].\n2. Start cable diagnostic test by writing a ‘1’ to Regist er 1Dh, bit [15]. This enable bit is self-clearing.\n3. Wait (poll) for Register 1Dh, bit [15] to return a ‘0’, and indicating cable diagnostic test is completed.\n4. Read cable diagnostic test results in Register 1Dh, bits [14:13]. The results are as follows:\n00 = normal condition (valid test)\n01 = open condition detected in cable (valid test)\n10 = short condition detected in cable (valid test)\n11 = cable diagnostic test failed (invalid test)\nThe ‘11’ case, invalid test, occurs when the device is unable to shut down the link partner. In this instance, the test  \nis not run, since it would be impossible for the device to dete rmine if the detected signal is a reflection of the signal  \ngenerated or a signal from another source.\n5. Get distance to fault by concatenating Register 1Dh, bits  [8:0] and multiplying the re sult by a constant of 0.38.  \nThe distance to the cable fault can be determined by the following formula:\nD (distance to cable fault) = 0. 38 x (Register 1Dh, bits [8:0])\nD (distance to cable fault)  is expressed in meters.\nConcatenated value of Registers 1Dh bits [8:0] should  be converted to decimal before multiplying by 0.38.\nThe constant (0.38) may be calibrated for different cabling conditions, incl uding cables with a velocity of propaga -\ntion that varies signifi cantly from the norm.\n\uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS00002202B-page  29KSZ8081MNX/RNB\n3.10 NAND Tree Support\nThe KSZ8081MNX/RNB provides parametric NAND tree support for fault detection between chip I/Os and board. The  \nNAND tree is a chain of nested NAND gates in which eac h KSZ8081MNX/RNB digital I/O (NAND tree input) pin is an  \ninput to one NAND gate along the chain. At the end of the chain, the TXD1 pin provides the output for the nested NAND  \ngates.\nThe NAND tree test process includes:\n• Enabling NAND tree mode\n• Pulling all NAND tree input pins high\n• Driving each NAND tree input pin low, sequentially, according to the NAND tree pin order\n• Checking the NAND tree output to make sure there is a toggl e high-to-low or low-to-high for each NAND tree input \ndriven low\nTable 3-6 and Table  3-7 list the NAND tree pin orders for KSZ8081MNX and KSZ8081RNB, respectively.\nTABLE 3-6: NAND TREE TEST PIN ORDER FOR KSZ8081MNX\nPin Number Pin Name NAND Tree Description\n11 MDIO Input\n12 MDC Input\n15 RXD1 Input\n16 RXD0 Input\n18 CRS_DV Input\n19 REF_CLK Input\n21 INTRP Input\n23 TXEN Input\n30 LED0 Input\n24 TXD0 Input\n25 TXD1 Output\nNote 3-1 KS80 81MNX supports partial NAND tree test pins.

Enable NAND tree mode using either hardware (NAND_Tr ee#, Pin 21) or software (Register 16h, Bit [5]).\n2. Use board logic to drive all KSZ8081M NX/RNB NAND tree input pins high.\n3. Use board logic to drive each NAND tree input pin, in KSZ8081MNX/RNB NAND tree pin order, as follows:\na) Toggle the first pin (MDIO) from high to low, and verify  that the TXD1 pin switches from high to low to indicate  \nthat the first pin is connected properly.\nb) Leave the first pin (MDIO) low.\nc) Toggle the second pin (MDC) from high to low, and verify that the TXD1 pin switches from low to high to  \nindicate that the second pin is connected properly.\nd) eave the first pin (MDIO) and the second pin (MDC) low.\ne) Continue with this sequence until all KSZ8081MNX /RNB NAND tree input pins have been toggled.\nEach KSZ8081MNX/RNB NAND tree input pin must cause the TX D1 output pin to toggle high-to-low or low-to-high to  \nindicate a good connection. If the TXD1 pin fails to t oggle when the KSZ8081MNX/RNB input pin toggles from high to  \nlow, the input pin has a fault.\n3.11 Power Management\nThe KSZ8081MNX/RNB incorporates a number of power-management modes and features that pr ovide methods to  \nconsume less energy. These are discussed in the following sections.\n3.11.1 POWER-SAVING MODE\nPower-saving mode is used to reduce the transceiver power  consumption when the cable is unplugged. It is enabled  \nby writing a ‘1’ to Register 1Fh, Bit [ 10], and is in effect when auto-negotiation  mode is enabled and the cable is discon -\nnected (no link). \nIn this mode, the KSZ8081MNX/RNB shuts down all transceiver blocks, except for the transmitter, energy detect, and  \nPLL circuits. \nBy default, power-saving mode is disabled after power-up.\n3.11.2 ENERGY-DETEC T POWER-DOWN MODE\nEnergy-detect power-down (EDPD) mode is used to furthe r reduce transceiver power consumption when the cable is  \nunplugged. It is enabled by writing a ‘0’ to Register 18h, Bit [11], and is in effect when auto-negotiation mode is enabled  \nand the cable is disconnected (no link). \nEDPD mode works with the PLL off (set by writing a ‘1’ to Register 10h, Bit [4] to automatically turn the PLL off in EDPD  \nmode) to turn off all KSZ8081MNX/RNB transceiver blo cks except the transmitter and energy-detect circuits.\nPower can be reduced further by extending the time interval  between transmissions of link pulses to check for the pres -\nence of a link partner. The periodic transmission of link pulses is needed to ensure the KSZ8081MNX/RNB and its link  \npartner, when operating in the same low-power state and with  Auto MDI/MDI-X disabled, can wake up when the cable  \nis connected between them.\nBy default, energy-detect power-down mode is disabled after power-up.\n3.11.3 POWER-DOWN MODE\nPower-down mode is used to power down the KSZ8081MNX/RNB  device when it is not in use after power-up. It is  \nenabled by writing a ‘1’ to Register 0h, Bit [11]. \nIn this mode, the KSZ8081MNX/RNB disables all internal  functions except the MII management interface. The  \nKSZ8081MNX/RNB exits (disables) po wer-down mode after Register 0h, Bit [11] is set back to ‘0’.\n\uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.  DS00002202B-page  31KSZ8081MNX/RNB\n3.11.4 SLOW-OSCILLATOR MODE\nSlow-oscillator mode is used to disconnect the input reference crystal/clock on XI (Pin 8)  and select the on-chip slow  \noscillator when the KSZ8081MNX/RNB device is not in use after power-up. It is enabled by writing a ‘1’ to Register 11h,  \nBit [5].\nSlow-oscillator mode works in conjunction with power-down mode to put the KSZ8081MNX/RNB device in the lowest  \npow\ner state, with all internal functions disabled except t he MII management interface. To properly exit this mode and  \nreturn to normal PHY operation, use the following programming sequence:1. Disable slow-oscillator mode by writing a ‘0’ to Register 11h, Bit [5].\n2. Disable power-down mode by writing a ‘0’ to Register 0h, Bit [11].\n3. Initiate software reset by writin g a ‘1’\n  to Register 0h, Bit [15].\n3.12 Reference Circuit for Power and Ground Connections\nThe KSZ8081MNX/RNB is a single 3.3V supply device with a bui lt-in regulator to supply the 1.2V core.

Therefore, the two transformer c enter tap pins on the KS Z8081MNX/RNB side should not be connected to any  \npower supply source on the board; instead, the center tap pins should be separated from one another and connected  \nthrough separate 0.1  µF common-mode capacitors to ground. Separ a tion is required because the common-mode volt -\nage is different between transmitting and receiving differential pairs.\nFigure  7-16 shows the typical magnetic interf ace circui t for the KSZ8081MNX/RNB.\nFIGURE 7-16: TYPICAL MAGNETIC INTERFACE CIRCUIT\n1\n2\n3\n7\n84\n5\n6\n4 x 75Ω\n1000pF/2kV \nRJ-45 CONNECTOR\nCHASSIS GROUND(2 x 0.1μF)TXP\nTXM\nRXP\nRXMKSZ8081MNX/RNB\nSIGNAL GROUND\nTable 7-13 lists recommended magnetic characteristics.\nTABLE 7-13: MAGNETICS  SELECTION CRITERIA\nParameter Value Test Condition\nTurns ratio 1 CT : 1 CT —\nOpen-circuit inductance (minimum) 350 µH 100 mV, 100  kHz, 8  mA\nInsertion loss (typical) –1.1 dB 100 kHz to 100  MHz\nHIPOT (minimum) 1500 Vrms —\nKSZ8081MNX/RNB\nDS00002202B-page  60  \uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.Table 7-14 is a list of compatible single-port magnetics with separated transformer center tap pins on the PHY chip side  \nthat can be used wit h the KSZ8 081MNX/RNB.\nTABLE 7-14: COMPATIBLE SING LE-PORT 10/100 MAGNETICS\nManufacturer Part Number Temperature Range Magnetic + RJ-45\nBel Fuse S558-5999-U7 0°C to 70°C No\nBel Fuse SI-46001-F 0°C to 70°C Yes\nBel Fuse SI-50170-F 0°C to 70°C Yes\nDelta LF8505 0°C to 70°C No\nHALO HFJ11-2450E 0°C to 70°C Yes\nHALO TG110-E055N5 –40°C to 85°C No\nLANKom LF-H41S-1 0°C to 70°C No\nPulse H1102 0°C to 70°C No\nPulse H1260 0°C to 70°C No\nPulse HX1188 –40°C to 85°C No\nPulse J00-0014 0°C to 70°C Yes\nPulse JX0011D21NL –40°C to 85°C Yes\nTDK TLA-6T718A 0°C to 70°C Yes\nTranspower HB726 0°C to 70°C No\nWurth/Midcom 000-7090-37R-LF1 –40°C to 85°C No\n\uf0e3 2016-2017 Microchip Technology Inc.
