It features two data input-output ports (nA and nB), a direction control input\n(DIR) and dual supply pins (V CC(A)  and V CC(B) ). Both V CC(A)  and V CC(B)  can be supplied at\nany voltage between 0.8 V and 3.6 V making the device suitable for translating between\nany of the low voltage nodes (0.8 V, 1.2 V, 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V and 3.3 V). Pins nA and\nDIR are referenced to V CC(A)  and pins nB are referenced to V CC(B) . A HIGH on DIR\nallows transmission from nA to nB and a LOW on DIR allows transmission from nB to nA.\nThe device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF\ncircuitry disables the output, preventing any damaging backflow current through the\ndevice when it is powered down. In suspend mode when either V CC(A)  or V CC(B)  are at\nGND level, both A and B are in the high-impedance OFF-state.\nThe 74AVCH2T45 has active bus hold circuitry which is provided to hold unused or\nfloating data inputs at a valid logic level. This feature eliminates the need for external\npull-up or pull-down resistors.\n2Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range:\n–VCC(A) : 0.8 V to 3.6 V\n–VCC(B) : 0.8 V to 3.6 V\n•High noise immunity\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n–JESD8-12 (0.8 V to 1.3 V)\n–JESD8-11 (0.9 V to 1.65 V)\n–JESD8-7 (1.2 V to 1.95 V)\n–JESD8-5 (1.8 V to 2.7 V)\n–JESD8-B (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•ESD protection:\n–HBM JESD22-A114F Class 3B exceeds 8000 V\n–MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n–CDM JESD22-C101C exceeds 1000 V\n•Maximum data rates:\n–500 Mbps (1.8 V to 3.3 V translation)\n–320 Mbps (< 1.8 V to 3.3 V translation)\n–320 Mbps (translate to 2.5 V or 1.8 V)\n–280 Mbps (translate to 1.5 V)\n–240 Mbps (translate to 1.2 V)\n•Suspend mode\n•Bus hold on data inputs\nNexperia74AVCH2T45\nDual-bit, dual-supply voltage level translator/transceiver; 3-state\n74AVCH2T45 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2018.

For example, if the 74AVCH2T45\ninitially is transmitting from A to B, then the DIR bit is switched, the B port of the device\nmust be disabled before presenting it with an input. After the B port has been disabled,\nan input signal applied to it appears on the corresponding A port after the specified\npropagation delay.\nNexperia74AVCH2T45\nDual-bit, dual-supply voltage level translator/transceiver; 3-state\n74AVCH2T45 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2018.

### Description:
The 74AVCH2T45 is a dual-bit, dual-supply voltage level translator/transceiver that allows for bidirectional data transmission between devices operating at different voltage levels. It is particularly useful in applications where devices with different voltage requirements need to communicate, such as interfacing between 1.8 V and 3.3 V logic levels.

### Typical Applications:
- **Level Shifting:** Used in systems where different components operate at different voltage levels, ensuring compatibility and preventing damage.
- **Bidirectional Communication:** Ideal for applications requiring data exchange between two systems with varying voltage levels.
- **Microcontroller Interfacing:** Commonly used in microcontroller applications where sensors or other peripherals operate at different voltage levels.
- **Power Management:** Helps in managing power levels in mixed-voltage systems, enhancing overall system efficiency.

This component is suitable for a wide range of applications in consumer electronics, automotive systems, and industrial automation, where reliable communication between devices of varying voltage levels is essential.
