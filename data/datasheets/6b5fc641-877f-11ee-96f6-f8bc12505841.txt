A For more information www.analog.com Document FeedbackDESCRIPTION\nTYPICAL APPLICATION  FEATURESLow I Q Boost/SEPIC/ \nInverting Converter \nwith 4A, 60V Switch\nThe LT®8364 is a current mode DC/DC converter with a \n60V, 4A switch operating from a 2.8V to 60V input. With \na unique single feedback pin architecture it is capable \nof boost, SEPIC or inverting configurations. Burst Mode \noperation consumes as low as 9µA quiescent current to \nmaintain high efficiency at very low output currents, while \nkeeping typical output ripple below 15mV. \nAn external compensation pin allows optimization of loop \nbandwidth over a wide range of input and output volt -\nages  and programmable switching frequencies between 300kHz and 2MHz. A SYNC/MODE pin allows synchroni -\nzation to an external clock. It can also be used to select between burst or pulse-skip modes of operation with or without Spread Spectrum Frequency Modulation for low \nEMI. For increased efficiency, a BIAS pin can accept a \nsecond input to supply the INTV CC regulator . Additional \nfeatures include frequency foldback and  programmable soft-start to control inductor current during startup. \nThe LT8364 is available in a thermally enhanced 12-lead \n4mm  × 3mm  DFN package or a thermally enhanced \n16-lead MSOP package with four pins removed.\n2MHz, 48V Output Boost ConverterAPPLICATIONS nWide Input Voltage Range: 2.8V to 60V\n nUltralow Quiescent Current and Low Ripple \nBurst\xa0Mode® Operation: I Q = 9µA\n n4A, 60V Power Switch\n nPositive or Negative Output Voltage Programming with a Single Feedback Pin\n nProgrammable Frequency (300kHz to 2MHz)\n nSynchronizable to an External Clock\n nSpread Spectrum Frequency Modulation for Low EMI\n nBIAS Pin for Higher Efficiency\n nProgrammable Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\n nThermally Enhanced 12-lead 4mm × 3mm DFN and 16-lead MSOP packages\n nAEC-Q100 Qualified for Automotive Applications\n nIndustrial and Automotive\n nTelecom\n nMedical Diagnostic Equipment\n nPortable Electronics\nEfficiency and Power Loss\nEFFICIENCY\nPOWER LOSS\nV\nIN\n = 12V\nV\nIN\n = 24V\nLOAD CURRENT (A)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n1.2\n1.5\n1.8\n2.1\n2.4\n2.7\n3.0\nEFFICIENCY (%)\nPOWER LOSS (W)\n8364 TA01b\n8364 TA01a\n34.8k\n36.5k\n2.2nF\n20k\n1µF\nVIN\nSW\nEN/UVLO\nL T8364\nVIN\n8V TO 38V\nVOUT\n48V\n300mA AT V IN = 8V\n640mA AT V IN = 12V\n1A AT V IN = 24V\n3.3/uni03BCH\n1M\nSYNC/MODE\nFBX\nBIAS\nSS\nGND\nVC\n4.7µF\nx2\n4.7µF\nRT\nINTV CC\n10nFAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nLT8364\n2\nRev.

Below an accurate 1.6V threshold, \nthe part enters undervoltage lockout and stops switching. \nThis allows an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold to \nbe programmed for system input voltage by resistively \ndividing down system input voltage to the EN/UVLO pin. \nAn 80mV pin hysteresis ensures part switching resumes when the pin exceeds 1.68V. EN/UVLO pin voltage below \n0.2V reduces V IN current below 1µA. If shutdown and \nUVLO features are not required, the pin can be tied directly \nto system input.\nVIN: Input Supply. This pin must be locally bypassed. Be \nsure to place the positive terminal of the input capacitor as \nclose as possible to the V IN pin, and the negative terminal \nas close as possible to the exposed pad PGND copper \n(near EN/UVLO).\nINTV CC: Regulated 3.2V Supply for Internal Loads. The \nINTV CC pin must be bypassed with a 1µF low ESR ceramic \ncapacitor to GND. No additional components or loading is \nallowed on this pin. INTV CC draws power from the BIAS \npin if 4.4V ≤ BIAS ≤ V IN, otherwise INTV CC is powered by \nthe V IN pin.\nNC: No Internal Connection. Leave this pin open.\nBIAS:  Second Input Supply for Powering INTV CC. \nRemoves the majority of INTV CC current from the V IN pin \nto improve efficiency when 4.4V ≤ BIAS ≤ V IN. If unused, \ntie the pin to GND.\nVC: Error Amplifier Output Pin. Tie external compensation \nnetwork to this pin.\nFBX:  Voltage Regulation Feedback Pin for Positive or \nNegative Outputs. Connect this pin to a resistor divider \nbetween the output and the exposed pad GND copper \n(near FBX). FBX reduces the switching frequency during \nstart-up and fault conditions when FBX is close to 0V.RT: A resistor from this pin to the exposed pad GND cop -\nper (near FBX) programs switching frequency.\nSS:\n Soft-Start Pin. Connect a capacitor from this pin to \nGND copper (near FBX) to control the ramp rate of induc -\ntor current during converter start-up. SS pin charging \ncurrent is 2μA . An internal 220Ω MOSFET discharges this \npin during shutdown or fault conditions.\nSYNC/MODE: This pin allows five selectable modes for \noptimization of performance. \nSYNC/MODE Pin Input Capable Mode(s) of Operation\n(1) GND or <0.14V Burst\n(2) External Clock Pulse-skip/Sync\n(3) 100k Resistor to GND Burst/SSFM\n(4) Float (pin open) Pulse-skip\n(5) INTV CC or >1.7V Pulse-skip/SSFM\nwhere the selectable modes of operation are,Burst = low I\nQ, low output ripple operation at light loads  \nPulse-skip = skipped pulse(s) at light load (aligned to clock) \nSync = switching frequency synchronized to external clock \nSSFM = Spread Spectrum Frequency Modulation for low \nEMI\nSW1, SW2 (SW): Output of the Internal Power Switch. \nMinimize the metal trace area connected to these pins to reduce EMI.\nPGND,GND:  Power Ground and Signal Ground for the \nIC. The package has an exposed pad underneath the IC which is the best path for heat out of the package. The pin  should be soldered to a continuous copper ground \nplane under the device to reduce die temperature and increase the power capability of the LT8364. Connect \npower ground components to the exposed pad copper \nexiting near the EN/UVLO and SW pins.

A For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nThe LT8364 uses a fixed frequency, current mode con -\ntrol scheme to provide excellent line and load regula-\ntion. Operation can be best understood by referring \nto the Block Diagram. An oscillator (with frequency \nprogrammed by a resistor at the RT pin) turns on the \ninternal power switch at the beginning of each clock \ncycle. Current in the inductor then increases until the \ncurrent comparator trips and turns off the power switch. \nThe peak inductor current at which the switch turns off \nis controlled by the voltage on the V C pin. The error \namplifier servos the V C pin by comparing the voltage on \nthe FBX pin with an internal reference voltage (1.60V or –0.80V, depending on the chosen topology). When the \nload current increases it causes a reduction in the FBX \npin voltage relative to the internal reference. This causes \nthe error amplifier to increase the V C pin voltage until the \nnew load current is satisfied. In this manner , the error \namplifier sets the correct peak switch current level to \nkeep the output in regulation.\nThe LT8364 is capable of generating either a positive or \nnegative output voltage with a single FBX pin. It can be configured as a boost or SEPIC converter to generate a \npositive output voltage, or as an inverting converter to \ngenerate a negative output voltage. When configured as \na Boost converter , as shown in the Block Diagram, the \nFBX pin is pulled up to the internal bias voltage of 1.60V \nby a voltage divider (R1 and R2) connected from V OUT \nto GND. Amplifier A2 becomes inactive and amplifier A1 performs (inverting) amplification from FBX to V\nC. When \nthe LT8364 is in an inverting configuration, the FBX pin is pulled down to –0.80V by a voltage divider from V\nOUT \nto GND. Amplifier A1 becomes inactive and amplifier A2 performs (non-inverting) amplification from FBX to V\nC. If the EN/UVLO pin voltage is below 1.6V, the LT8364  \nenters undervoltage lockout (UVLO), and stops switching. \nWhen the EN/UVLO pin voltage is above 1.68V (typical), the LT8364 resumes switching. If the EN/UVLO pin volt -\nage is below 0.2V, the LT8364 draws less than 1µA from V\nIN.\nFor the SYNC/MODE pin tied to ground or < 0.14V, the \nLT8364 will enter low output ripple Burst Mode opera-\ntion for ultra low quiescent current during light loads to maintain high efficiency. For a 100k resistor from SYNC/\nMODE pin to GND, the LT8364 uses Burst Mode opera -\ntion for improved efficiency at light loads but seamlessly \ntransitions to Spread-Spectrum Modulation of switch -\ning frequency for low EMI at heavy loads. For the SYNC/\nMODE pin floating (left open), the LT8364 uses pulse-\nskipping mode, at the expense of hundreds of microamps, \nto maintain output voltage regulation at light loads by \nskipping switch pulses. For the SYNC/MODE pin tied to INTV\nCC or >1.7V, the LT8364 uses pulse-skipping mode \nand performs Spread-Spectrum Modulation of switching frequency. For the SYNC/MODE pin driven by an external clock, the converter switching frequency is synchronized \nto that clock and pulse-skipping mode is also enabled. See \nthe Pin Functions section for SYNC/MODE pin.\nThe LT8364 includes a BIAS pin to improve efficiency \nacross all loads. The LT8364 intelligently chooses \nbetween the V IN and BIAS pins to supply the INTV CC for \nbest efficiency. The INTV CC supply current can be drawn \nfrom the BIAS pin instead of the V IN pin for 4.4V ≤ BIAS \n≤ VIN.\nProtection features ensure the immediate disable of \nswitching and reset of the SS pin for any of the following \nfaults: internal reference UVLO, INTV CC UVLO, switch cur -\nrent > 1.5× maximum limit, EN/UVLO < 1.6V or junction temperature > 170°C.\nLT8364\n11\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa01. Burst Frequency vs Load CurrentACHIEVING UL TRALOW QUIESCENT CURRENT \nTo enhance efficiency at light loads the LT8364  uses a \nlow ripple Burst Mode architecture. This keeps the out -\nput capacitor charged to the desired output voltage while \nminimizing the input quiescent current and output ripple. \nIn Burst Mode operation, the LT8364 delivers single small \npulses of current to the output capacitor followed by sleep \nperiods where the output power is supplied by the output \ncapacitor . While in sleep mode, the LT8364  consumes \nonly 9µA.\nAs the output load decreases, the frequency of single cur -\nrent pulses decreases (see Figure\xa01) and the percentage of time the LT8364 is in sleep mode increases, resulting in much higher light load efficiency than for typical con -\nverters. To optimize the quiescent current performance \nat light loads, the current in the feedback resistor divider \nmust be minimized as it appears to the output as load \ncurrent. In addition, all possible leakage currents from \nthe output should also be minimized as they all add to the \nequivalent output load. The largest contributor to leakage current can be due to the reverse biased leakage of the Schottky diode (see Diode Selection in the Applications Information section).\nWhile in Burst Mode operation, the current limit of the \nswitch is approximately 1A resulting in the output voltage \nripple shown in Figure\xa02. Increasing the output capaci-\ntance will decrease the output ripple proportionally. As \nthe output load ramps upward from zero the switching \nfrequency will increase but only up to the fixed frequency Figure\xa02. sBurst Mode Operation\ndefined by the resistor at the RT pin as shown in Figure\xa01. \nThe output load at which the LT8364 reaches the fixed \nfrequency varies based on input voltage, output voltage, and inductor choice.\nPROGRAMMING INPUT TURN-ON AND TURN-OFF \nTHRESHOLDS WITH EN/UVLO PIN \nThe EN/UVLO pin voltage controls whether the LT8364 is \nenabled or is in a shutdown state. A 1.6V reference and a comparator A6 with built-in hysteresis (typical 80mV) \nallow the user to accurately program the system input \nvoltage at which the IC turns on and off (see the Block \nDiagram). The typical input falling and rising threshold \nvoltages can be calculated by the following equations: \n VIN(FALLING,UVLO(–))  = 1.60 •  R3 + R4\nR4\nVIN(RISING, UVLO(+))  = 1.68 •  R3 + R4\nR4\nVIN current is reduced below 1µA when the EN/UVLO pin \nvoltage is less than 0.2V. The EN/UVLO pin can be con -\nnected directly to the input supply V IN for always-enabled \noperation. A logic input can also control the EN/UVLO pin.\nWhen operating in Burst Mode operation for light load \ncurrents, the current through the R3 and R4 network can \neasily be greater than the supply current consumed by the \nLT8364. Therefore, R3 and R4 should be large enough to minimize their effect on efficiency at light loads.\nLOAD CURRENT (mA)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\nSWITCHING FREQUENCY (MHz)\n8364 F01\nV\nIN\n = 12V\nV\nOUT\n = 48V\nFRONT PAGE APPLICATION\n10µs/DIV\nI\nL\n1A/DIV\nV\nOUT\n20mV/DIV\n8364 F02\nLT8364\n12\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nINTV CC REGULATOR\nA low dropout (LDO) linear regulator , supplied from V IN, \nproduces a 3.2V supply at the INTV CC pin. A minimum \n1µF low ESR ceramic capacitor must be used to bypass \nthe INTV CC pin to ground to supply the high transient cur -\nrents required by the internal power MOSFET gate driver .\nNo additional components or loading is allowed on this \npin. The INTV CC rising threshold (to allow soft-start and \nswitching) is typically 2.65V. The INTV CC falling threshold \n(to stop switching and reset soft-start) is typically 2.5V.  \nTo improve efficiency across all loads, the majority of \nINTV CC current can be drawn from the BIAS pin (4.4V ≤ \nBIAS ≤ V IN) instead of the V IN pin. For SEPIC applications \nwith V IN often greater than V OUT, the BIAS pin can be \ndirectly connected to V OUT. If the BIAS pin is connected \nto a supply other than V OUT, be sure to bypass the pin \nwith a local ceramic capacitor .\nProgramming Switching Frequency\nThe LT8364 uses a constant frequency PWM architecture \nthat can be programmed to switch from 300kHz to 2MHz \nby using a resistor tied from the RT pin to ground. A table \nshowing the necessary R T value for a desired switching \nfrequency is in Table\xa01.\nThe R T resistor required for a desired switching frequency \ncan be calculated using:\n RT=51.2\nfOSC– 5.6\nwhere R T is in kΩ and f OSC is the desired switching fre -\nquency in MHz.\nTable\xa01. SW Frequency vs R T Value\nfOSC (MHz) RT (kΩ)\n0.3 165\n0.45 107\n0.75 63.4\n1 45.3\n1.5 28.7\n2 20Synchronization and Mode Selection\nTo select low ripple Burst Mode operation, for high effi-\nciency at light loads, tie the SYNC/MODE pin below 0.14V  \n(this can be ground or a logic low output). To synchronize the LT8364 oscillator to an external fre -\nquency connect a square wave (with 20% to 80% duty \ncycle) to the SYNC pin. The square wave amplitude should \nhave valleys that are below 0.4V and peaks above 1.7V \n(up to 6V). The LT8364 will not enter Burst Mode opera -\ntion at low output loads while synchronized to an external \nclock, but instead will pulse skip to maintain regulation. \nThe LT8364 may be synchronized over a 300kHz to 2MHz \nrange. The R T resistor should be chosen to set the LT8364  \nswitching frequency equal to or below the lowest synchro -\nnization input. For example, if the synchronization signal will be 500kHz and higher , the R\nT should be selected for \n500kHz. \nFor some applications it is desirable for the LT8364 to \noperate in pulse-skipping mode, offering two major differ -\nences from Burst Mode operation. Firstly, the clock stays awake at all times and all switching cycles are aligned to the clock. Secondly, the full switching frequency is main -\ntained at lower output load than in Burst Mode operation. These two differences come at the expense of increased quiescent current. To enable pulse-skipping mode, float the SYNC pin.\nTo improve EMI/EMC, the LT8364 can provide spread \nspectrum frequency modulation (SSFM). This feature var -\nies the clock with a triangle frequency modulation of 20%. \nFor example, if the LT8364\'s frequency was programmed \nto switch at 2MHz, spread spectrum mode will modulate \nthe oscillator between 2MHz and 2.4MHz. The 20% modu -\nlation will occur at a frequency: f OSC/256 where f OSC is \nthe switching frequency programmed using the RT pin.\nThe LT8364 can also be configured to operate in pulse-\nskipping/SSFM mode by tying the SYNC/MODE pin above \n1.7V. The LT8364 can also be configured for Burst Mode \noperation at light loads (for improved efficiency) and \nSSFM at heavy loads (for low EMI) by tying a 100k from \nthe SYNC/MODE pin to GND. \nLT8364\n13\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comDUTY CYCLE CONSIDERATION\nThe LT8364 minimum on-time, minimum off-time and \nswitching frequency (f OSC) define the allowable minimum \nand maximum duty cycles of the converter (see Minimum \nOn-Time, Minimum Off-Time, and Switching Frequency \nin the Electrical Characteristics table).\n Minimum Allowable Duty Cycle = \nMinimum On-Time(MAX)  •  fOSC(MAX)\nMaximum Allowable Duty Cycle = \n1 –  Minimum Off-Time(MAX)  •  fOSC(MAX)\nThe required switch duty cycle range for a Boost converter \noperating in continuous conduction mode (CCM) can be calculated as:\n DMIN = 1 – VIN(MAX)\nVOUT + VD\nDMAX = 1 – VIN(MIN)\nVOUT + VD\nwhere V D is the diode forward voltage drop. If the above \nduty cycle calculations for a given application violate the minimum and/or maximum allowed duty cycles \nfor the LT8364 , operation in discontinuous conduction \nmode\xa0(DCM) might provide a solution. For the same V IN \nand V OUT levels, operation in DCM does not demand as \nlow a duty cycle as in CCM. DCM also allows higher duty \ncycle operation than CCM. The additional advantage of \nDCM is the removal of the limitations to inductor value \nand duty cycle required to avoid sub-harmonic oscilla -\ntions and the right half plane zero (RHPZ). While DCM \nprovides these benefits, the trade-off is higher inductor peak current, lower available output power and reduced efficiency.\nSETTING THE OUTPUT VOL TAGE \nThe output voltage is programmed with a resistor divider \nfrom the output to the FBX pin. Choose the resistor values \nfor a positive output voltage according to:\n R1 = R2 •  VOUT\n1.60V–1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟Choose the resistor values for a negative output voltage \naccording to:\n R1 = R2 •  |VOUT|\n0.80V–1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nThe locations of R1 and R2 are shown in the Block \nDiagram. 1% resistors are recommended to maintain \noutput voltage accuracy.\nHigher-value FBX divider resistors result in the lowest \ninput quiescent current and highest light-load efficiency. \nFBX divider resistors R1 and R2 are usually in the range \nfrom 25k to 1M. \nSOFT-START\nThe LT8364 contains several features to limit peak switch \ncurrents and output voltage (V OUT) overshoot during \nstart-up or recovery from a fault condition. The primary \npurpose of these features is to prevent damage to external \ncomponents or the load.\nHigh peak switch currents during start-up may occur \nin switching regulators. Since V OUT is far from its final \nvalue, the feedback loop is saturated and the regulator \ntries to charge the output capacitor as quickly as possible, \nresulting in large peak currents. A large surge current may \ncause inductor saturation or power switch failure. \nThe LT8364  addresses this mechanism with a programma -\nble soft-start function. As shown in the Block Diagram, the \nsoft-start function controls the ramp of the power switch \ncurrent by controlling the ramp of V C through Q1. This \nallows the output capacitor to be charged gradually toward \nits final value while limiting the start-up peak currents.  \nFigure\xa03 shows the output voltage and supply current for the first page Typical Application. It can be seen that both the output voltage and supply current come up gradually.\nFAUL T PROTECTION\nAn inductor overcurrent fault (> 7.5A) and/or INTV CC \nundervoltage (INTV CC < 2.5V) and/or thermal lockout \n(TJ\xa0 >\xa0170°C) will immediately prevent switching, will \nreset the SS\xa0pin and will pull down V C. Once all faults are \nremoved, the LT8364 will soft-start V C and hence inductor \npeak current. APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT8364\n14\nRev. A For more information www.analog.comFigure\xa03. Soft-Start WaveformsAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFREQUENCY FOLDBACK \nDuring start-up or fault conditions in which V OUT is very \nlow, extremely small duty cycles may be required to main -\ntain control of inductor peak current. The minimum on-\ntime limitation of the power switch might prevent these low duty cycles from being achievable. In this scenario \ninductor current rise will exceed inductor current fall \nduring each cycle, causing inductor current to “walk up” \nbeyond the switch current limit. The LT8364 provides \nprotection from this by folding back switching frequency \nwhenever FBX or SS pins are close to GND (low V OUT \nlevels or start-up). This frequency foldback provides a \nlarger switch-off time, allowing inductor current to fall \nenough each cycle (see Normalized Switching Frequency \nvs FBX Voltage in the Typical Performance Characteristics  \nsection).\nTHERMAL LOCKOUT\nIf the LT8364 die temperature reaches 170°C  (typical), \nthe part will stop switching and go into thermal lockout. \nWhen the die temperature has dropped by 5°C  (nominal), \nthe part will resume switching with a soft-started inductor \npeak current.COMPENSATION\nLoop compensation determines the stability and transient \nperformance. The LT8364 uses current mode control to \nregulate the output which simplifies loop compensation. \nThe optimum values depend on the converter topology, the \ncomponent values and the operating conditions (including \nthe input voltage, load current, etc.). To compensate the feedback loop of the LT8364, a series resistor-capacitor \nnetwork is usually connected from the V C pin to GND. \nThe Block Diagram shows the typical V C compensation \nnetwork. For most applications, the capacitor should be \nin the range of 100pF to 10nF, and the resistor should \nbe in the range of 5k to 100k. A small capacitor is often connected in parallel with the RC compensation network to attenuate the V\nC voltage ripple induced from the out-\nput voltage ripple through the internal error amplifier . The \nparallel capacitor usually ranges in value from 2.2pF to \n22pF. A practical approach to designing the compensa -\ntion network is to start with one of the circuits in this data \nsheet that is similar to your application, and tune the com -\npensation network to optimize the performance. Stability should then be checked across all operating conditions, \nincluding load current, input voltage and temperature. \nApplication Note 76 is a good reference.\nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS\nCare should be taken in the layout of the PCB to ensure \ngood heat sinking of the LT8364. Both packages have an \nexposed pad underneath the IC which is the best path \nfor heat out of the package. The exposed pad should be soldered to a continuous copper ground plane under the device to reduce die temperature and increase the power \ncapability of the LT8364. The ground plane should be \nconnected to large copper layers to spread heat dissi -\npated by the LT8364. Power dissipation within the LT8364  \n(PDISS_LT8364 ) can be estimated by subtracting the induc -\ntor and Schottky diode power losses from the total power \nlosses calculated in an efficiency measurement. The junc-\ntion temperature of LT8364 can then be estimated by:   \n TJ(LT8364) = TA + θJA •  PDISS_LT8364\nAPPLICATION CIRCUITS\nThe LT8364 can be configured for different topologies. \nThe first topology to be analyzed will be the boost con -\nverter , followed by the SEPIC and inverting converters.\nBoost Converter : Switch Duty Cycle\nThe LT8364 can be configured as a boost converter for the \napplications where the converter output voltage is higher \nthan the input voltage.

Under a shorted output \ncondition, the inductor current is limited only by the \ninput supply capability. For applications requiring a step-\nup converter that is short-circuit protected, please refer \nto the Applications Information section covering SEPIC \nconverters.\nThe conversion ratio as a function of duty cycle is:\n VOUT\nVIN = 1\n1 − D\nin continuous conduction mode (CCM).\nFor a boost converter operating in CCM, the duty cycle \nof the main switch can be calculated based on the output voltage (V\nOUT) and the input voltage (V IN). The maximum \nduty cycle (D MAX) occurs when the converter has the \nminimum input voltage:\n DMAX = VOUT − VIN(MIN)\nVOUT\nDiscontinuous conduction mode (DCM) provides higher \nconversion ratios at a given frequency at the cost of \nreduced efficiencies, higher switching currents, and lower \navailable output power .\nBoost Converter: Maximum Output Current Capability \nand Inductor Selection\nFor the boost topology, the maximum average inductor \ncurrent is:\n IL(MAX)(AVG) = IO(MAX)  •  1\n1 − DMAX •  1\nη\nwhere η (< 1.0) is the converter efficiency.\nDue to the current limit of its internal power switch, the \nLT8364 should be used in a boost converter whose maxi -\nmum output current (I O(MAX) ) is:\n IO(MAX)  ≤ VIN(MIN)\nVOUT •  4A − 0.5 •  Δ ISW ( ) •  η\nMinimum possible inductor value and switching frequency \nshould also be considered since they will increase inductor \nripple current ∆I SW.The inductor ripple current ∆I SW has a direct effect on the \nchoice of the inductor value and the converter’ s maximum \noutput current capability. Choosing smaller values of ∆I\nSW increases output current capability, but  requires \nlarge inductances and reduces the current loop gain \n(the converter will approach voltage mode). Accepting \nlarger values of ∆ISW provides fast transient response and \nallows the use of low inductances, but results in higher input current ripple and greater core losses, and reduces output current capability. It is recommended to choose a ∆I\nSW of approximately 1.5A. \nGiven an operating input voltage range, and having cho -\nsen the operating frequency and ripple current in the \ninductor , the inductor value of the boost converter can \nbe determined using the following equation:\n L = VIN(MIN)\nΔISW •  fOSC •  DMAX\nThe peak inductor current is the switch current limit (max -\nimum 6.2A), and the RMS inductor current is approxi -\nmately equal to I L(MAX)(AVG) . \nChoose an inductor that can handle at least 6.2A without sat -\nurating, and ensure that the inductor has a low DCR (copper-\nwire resistance) to minimize I2R power losses. Note that in \nsome applications, the current handling requirements of the \ninductor can be lower , such as in the SEPIC topology where \neach inductor only carries one-half of the total switch cur -\nrent. For better efficiency, use similar valued inductors with a \nlarger volume. Many different sizes and shapes are available \nfrom various manufacturers (see Table\xa02). Choose a core material that has low losses at the programmed switching \nfrequency, such as a ferrite core. The final value chosen \nfor the inductor should not allow peak inductor currents to exceed 4A in steady state at maximum load. Due to toler -\nances, be sure to account for minimum possible inductance \nvalue, switching frequency and converter efficiency.\nFor inductor current operation in CCM and duty cycles \nabove 50%, the LT8364\'s internal slope compensa-tion prevents sub-harmonic oscillations provided the \ninductor value exceeds a minimum value given by: \n \n L>VIN\n–28 •D2+42•D–10 ( )• fOSC( )•2•D–1( )\n1–D( )\nLT8364\n16\nRev.

Y5V types have poor \nperformance over temperature and applied voltage, and \nshould not be used. A 4.7µF to 10µF ceramic capacitor is adequate to bypass the LT8364 and will easily handle the ripple current. If the input power source has high imped -\nance, or there is significant inductance due to long wires or cables, additional bulk capacitance may be necessar y\n. \nThis can be provided with a low performance electrolytic capacitor .\nA precaution regarding the ceramic input capacitor con -\ncerns the maximum input voltage rating of the LT8364. \nA ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable inductance forms a high quality (under damped) tank cir -\ncuit. If the LT8364 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the \ninput voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possibly exceeding the LT8364’s voltage rating. This situation is easily avoided (see Application Note 88). \nBOOST CONVERTER: OUTPUT CAPACITOR SELECTION\nLow ESR (equivalent series resistance) capacitors should \nbe used at the output to minimize the output ripple volt -\nage. Multilayer ceramic capacitors are an excellent choice, \nas they are small and have extremely low ESR. Use X5R or \nX7R types. This choice will provide low output ripple and \ngood transient response. A 4.7µF to 47µF output capacitor \nis sufficient for most applications, but systems with very \nlow output currents may need only a 1µF or 2.2µF out -\nput capacitor . Solid tantalum or OS-CON capacitor can be \nused, but they will occupy more board area than a ceramic \nand will have a higher ESR. Always use a capacitor with a \nsufficient voltage rating.Contributions of ESR (equivalent series resistance), ESL (equivalent series inductance) and the bulk capacitance \nmust be considered when choosing the correct output \ncapacitors for a given output ripple voltage. The effect of \nthese three parameters (ESR, ESL and bulk C) on the out -\nput voltage ripple waveform for a typical boost converter is illustrated in Figure\xa04.\nThe choice of component(s) begins with the maximum \nacceptable ripple voltage (expressed as a percentage of \nthe output voltage), and how this ripple should be divided \nbetween the ESR step ∆V ESR and the charging/discharg -\ning ∆ VCOUT. For the purpose of simplicity, we will choose \n2% for the maximum output ripple, to be divided equally between ∆V\nESR and ∆V COUT. This percentage ripple will \nchange, depending on the requirements of the application, \nand the following equations can easily be modified.

L1 and L2 can be independent, but \ncan also be wound on the same core, since identical volt -\nages are applied to L1 and L2 throughout the switching cycle. \nFor the SEPIC topology, the current through L1 is the \nconverter input current. Based on the fact that, ideally, the \noutput power is equal to the input power , the maximum average inductor currents of L1 and L2 are:\n IL1 (MAX)(AVG) =IIN(MAX)(AVG) =IO(MAX)  •  DMAX\n1 − DMAX\nIL2(MAX)(AVG) = IO(MAX)\nIn a SEPIC converter , the switch current is equal to I L1 + \nIL2 when the power switch is on, therefore, the maximum \naverage switch current is defined as:\n ISW(MAX)(AVG) = IL1(MAX)(AVG) + IL2(MAX)(AVG)\n=IO(MAX)  •  1\n1 − DMAXIn a SEPIC converter, no DC path exists between the input  \nand output.

The Switch Current Waveform of the SEPIC Converter\nThe inductor ripple current has a direct effect on the \nchoice of the inductor value. Choosing smaller values of \n∆IL requires large inductances and reduces the current \nloop gain (the converter will approach voltage mode). \nAccepting larger values of ∆I L allows the use of low \ninductances, but results in higher input current ripple and \ngreater core losses. It is recommended that c falls in the \nrange of 0.5 to 0.8. \nDue to the current limit of its internal power switch, the \nLT8364 should be used in a SEPIC converter whose maxi -\nmum output current (I O(MAX) ) is:\n IO(MAX)  < (1 –  DMAX) •  (4A –  0.5 •  ∆ISW) •  η\nwhere η (< 1.0) is the converter efficiency.
