Data is always non-volatile for greater than \n20-years. Data is automatically protected on power loss by low-\nvoltage inhibit circuitry to prevent writes with voltage out of specification. The\nMR4A08B is the ideal memory solution for applications that must permanently store and retrieve critical \ndata and programs quickly.\nThe MR4A08B is available in small footprint 400-mil, 44-lead plastic small-outline TSOP type-II package or \n10 mm x 10 mm, 48-pin ball grid array (BGA) package with 0.75 mm ball centers. These packages are com-\npatible with similar low-power SRAM products and other non-volatile RAM products.\nThe MR4A08B provides highly reliable data storage over a wide range of temperatures. The product is of-\nfered with commercial (0 to +70 °C) and industrial (-40 to +85 °C) operating temperature range options.\nRoHS\nCONTENTS\n1.

VIL(min) = -0.5 VDC ; VIL(min) = -2.0 VAC (pulse width ≤ 10 ns) for I ≤ 20.0 mA.Table 2.2 Operating Conditions\nPower Up and Power Down Sequencing\nMRAM is protected from write operations whenever VDD is less than VWI. As soon as VDD exceeds VDD(min), \nthere is a startup time of 2 ms before read or write operations can start. This time allows memory power \nsupplies to stabilize. \nThe E and W  control signals should track VDD on power up to VDD- 0.2 V or VIH (whichever is lower) and re -\nmain high for the startup time. In most systems, this means that these signals should be pulled up with a \nresistor so that signal remains high if the driving signal is Hi-Z during power up. Any logic that drives  E and \nW  should hold the signals high with a power-on reset signal for longer than the startup time. \nDuring power loss or brownout where VDD goes below VWI, writes are protected and a startup time must be \nobserved when power returns above VDD(min).\nBROWNOUT or  POWER LOSS\nNORMAL\n OPERATIONVDD\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITEDVWIDD\n2 ms\nREAD/WRITE \nINHIBITED\nVIH STARTUP\nNORMAL\n OPERATION2 ms\nE\nWRECOVER\nVIH Figure 2.1  Power Up and Power Down DiagramMR4A08B Electrical Specifications\nMR4A08B  Rev. 8 .7  3/20186\nCopyright © 2018 Everspin Technologies  Parameter Symbol Min Typical Max Unit\nInput leakage current Ilkg(I)- - ±1 μA\nOutput leakage current Ilkg(O)- - ±1 μA\nOutput low voltage\n(IOL = +4 mA)\n(IOL = +100 μA)VOL- - 0.4\nVSS + 0.2V\nOutput high voltage\n(IOL = -4 mA)\n(IOL = -100 μA)VOH2.4\nVDD - 0.2- - VTable 2.3 DC Characteristics\nTable 2.4 Power Supply Characteristics\nParameter Symbol Typical Max Unit\nAC active supply current - read modes1\n(IOUT= 0 mA, VDD= max)IDDR60 68 mA\nAC active supply current - write modes1\n(VDD= max) IDDW152 180 mA\nAC standby current \n(VDD= max, E = VIH)\nno other restrictions on other inputsISB19 14 mA\nCMOS standby current\n(E  ≥  VDD - 0.2 V and VIn ≤ VSS + 0.2 V or ≥ VDD - 0.2 V)\n(VDD = max, f = 0 MHz)ISB25 9 mA\n1 All active current measurements are measured with one address transition per cycle and at minimum cycle time.MR4A08B Electrical Specifications\nMR4A08B  Rev. 8.7    3/20187\nCopyright © 2018 Everspin Technologies  Parameter Value Unit\nLogic input timing measurement reference level 1.5 V\nLogic output timing measurement reference level 1.5 V\nLogic input pulse levels 0 or 3.0 V\nInput rise/fall time 2 ns\nOutput load for low and high impedance parameters See Figure 3.1\nOutput load for all other timing parameters See Figure 3.2Parameter Symbol Typical Max Unit\nAddress input capacitance CIn- 6 pF\nControl input capacitance CIn- 6 pF\nInput/Output capacitance CI/O- 8 pF\n1 f = 1.0 MHz, dV = 3.0 V, TA = 25 °C, periodically sampled rather than 100% tested.MR4A08B\n3.
