Its programmability and wideband capability make it ideal for a broad range of transceiver applications. The device combines a RF front end with a flexible mixed-signal \nbaseband section and integrated frequency synthesizers, simplifying \ndesign-in by providing a configurable digital interface to a processor. The AD9361 receiver LO operates from 70 MHz to \n6.0 GHz and the transmitter LO operates from 47 MHz to 6.0 GHz range, covering most licensed and unlicensed bands. Channel bandwidths from less than 200 kHz to 56 MHz are supported. \nThe two independent direct conversion receivers have state-of-the-\nart noise figure and linearity. Each receive (RX) subsystem includes \nindependent automatic gain control (AGC), dc offset correction, quadrature correction, and digital filtering, thereby eliminating the need for these functions in the digital baseband. The AD9361 \nalso has flexible manual gain modes that can be externally \ncontrolled. Two high dynamic range analog-to-digital converters \n(ADCs) per channel digitize the received I and Q signals and pass them through configurable decimation filters and 128-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filters to produce a 12-bit output signal at the appropriate sample rate. \nThe transmitters use a direct conversion architecture that achieves \nhigh modulation accuracy with ultralow noise. This transmitter \ndesign produces a best in class TX error vector magnitude (EVM) \nof <−40 dB, allowing significant system margin for the external \npower amplifier (PA) selection. The on-board transmit (TX) power monitor can be used as a power detector, enabling highly \naccurate TX power measurements.  \nThe fully integrated phase-locked loops (PLLs) provide low \npower fractional-N frequency synthesis for all receive and transmit channels. Channel isolation, demanded by frequency \ndivision duplex (FDD) systems, is integrated into the design. \nAll VCO and loop filter components are integrated. \nThe core of the AD9361 can be powered directly from a 1.3 V \nregulator. The IC is controlled via a standard 4-wire serial port \nand four real-time input/output control pins. Comprehensive power-down modes are included to minimize power consumption during normal use. The AD9361  is packaged in a 10 mm × 10 mm, \n144-ball chip scale package ball grid array (CSP_BGA).  \n AD9361RX1B_P,\nRX1B_N\nP1_[D11:D0]/\nRX_[D5:D0]P0_[D11:D0]/\nTX_[D5:D0]\nRADIO\nSWITCHING\nNOTES\n1.

F | Page 33 of 36 THEORY OF OPERATION \nGENERAL  \nThe AD9361 is a highly integrated radio frequency (RF) \ntransceiver capable of being configured for a wide range of \napplications. The device integrates all RF, mixed signal, and  \ndigital blocks necessary to provide all transceiver functions in a \nsingle de vice. Programmability allows this broadband transceiver  \nto be adapted for use with multiple communication standards, including frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) systems. This p rogrammability also allows the \ndevice to be interfaced to various baseband processors (BBPs) using  \na single 12- bit parallel data port, dual 12- bit parallel data ports, \nor a 12 -bit low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) interface. \nThe AD9361 also provides self -calibration  and automatic gain \ncontrol (AGC) systems to maintain a high performance level under varying temperatures and input signal conditions. In addition, the device includes several te st modes that allow system  \ndesigners t o insert test tones and create internal loopback modes  \nthat can be used by designers to debug their designs during prototyping and optimize their radio configuration for a  \nspecific application.  \nRECEIVER  \nThe receiver s ection contains all blocks necessary to receive RF \nsignals and convert them to digital data that is usable by a BBP . \nThere are  two independently controlled channels that can receive \nsignals from different sources, allowing the device to be used in \nmulti ple input, multi ple output (MIMO) systems while  sharing \na common frequency synthesizer.  \nEach channel has three inputs that can be multiplexed to the \nsignal chain, making the AD9361 suitable for use in diversity \nsystems with multiple antenna inputs. The receiver is a direct \nconversion system that contains a low noise amplifier (LNA),  \nfollowed by matched in -phase (I) and quadrature (Q) amplifiers , \nmixers, and band shaping filters that down  convert rece ived \nsignals to baseband for digitization. External LNAs can also be interfaced to the device, allowing designers the flexibility to customize the receiver front end for their specific application.  \nGain control is achieved by following a preprogrammed gain  \nindex map that distributes gain among the blocks for optim al \nperformance at each level.  This can be achieved by enabling the \ninternal AGC in either fast or slow mode  or by using manual \ngain  control, allowing the BBP to make the gain adjustments as \nneeded.  Additionally, each channel contains independent RSSI \nmeasurement capability, dc  offset tracking, and all circuitry \nnecessary for self-calibration .  \nThe receivers include 12 -bit, Σ-Δ ADCs and adjustable sample \nrates that produce data streams from the recei ved signals. The \ndigitized signals can be conditioned further by a series of \ndecimation filters and a fully programmable  128-tap FIR filter \nwith  additional decimation se ttings. The sample rate of each digital filter block is adjustable  by changing decimati on factors \nto produce the desired output data rate.  \nTRANSMITTER  \nThe transmitter section consists of two identical and independently  \ncontrolled channels that provide all digital processing, mixed \nsignal, and RF blocks necessary to implement a direct convers ion \nsystem while sharing a common frequency synthesizer. The digital  \ndata received from the BBP passe s through a fully programmable \n128- tap FIR filter with interpolation options. The FIR output is \nsent to a series of interpolation filters that provide addi tional  \nfiltering and data rate interpolation prior to reaching  the DAC. \nEach 12 -bit DAC has an adjustable sampling rate. Both the I  \nand Q channels are fed to the RF block for upconversion.  \nWhen  converted to baseband analog signals, the I and Q signals are \nfiltered to remove sampling artifacts and fed to the upconversion mixers. At this point,  the I and Q signals are recombined and  \nmodulated on the carrier frequency for transmission to the \noutput stage. The combined signal  also pass es through analog \nfilters that provide additional band shaping , and then the signal \nis transmitted  to the output amplifier. Each transmit channel \nprovid es a wide attenuation adjustment range with fine granularity  \nto help designers optimize signal -to-noise ra tio (SNR).  \nSelf-calibration  circuitry is built into each transmit channel to \nprovide automatic real -time adjustment. The transmitter block \nalso provides a TX monitor block for each channel.  This block \nmonitors the transmitter output and routes it back through an \nunused receiver channel to the BBP for signal monitoring.  The \nTX monitor blocks are available only in TDD mode operation \nwhile the receiver is idle.   \nCLOCK INPUT OPTIONS  \nThe AD9361 oper ates using a reference clock that can be provided  \nby two different sources.  The first option is to use a  dedicated \ncryst al with a frequency between 19 MHz and 50  MHz connected  \nbetween the XTALP and XTAL N pins.  The second option is to \nconnect an external os cillator or clock distribution devic e (such as  \nthe AD9548 ) to the XTALN pin (with the XTAL P pin remaining  \nunconnected).  If an external oscillator is used, the frequency \ncan vary between 1 0 MHz and 80 MHz.  This reference clock \nis used to supply the synthesizer blocks that generate all data \nclocks, sample clocks, and local oscillators inside the device.  \nErrors in the crystal frequency can be removed by using the digitally programmable digitall y controlled crystal oscillator \n(DCXO ) function to adjust the  on-chip variable capacitor. This \ncapacitor can tune the crystal frequency variance out of the system, resulting in a more accurate reference clock from which \nall other frequency signals are gene rated. This function can also \nbe used with on -chip temperature sensing to provide oscillator \nfrequency temperature compensation during normal operation.  \nAD9361  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 34 of 36 SYNTHESIZERS  \nRF PLLs  \nThe AD9361 contains tw o identical synthesizers to generate the \nrequired L O signals  for the RF signal paths :—one for the receiver  \nand one fo r the transmitter. P hase-locked loop (PLL) synthesizers \nare fractional -N designs incorporating  completely integrated \nvoltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) and loop filters. In TDD \noperation, the synthesizers turn on and off as appropriate  for the \nRX and TX frames. In FDD mode, the TX PLL and the RX PLL \ncan be activated simultaneously . These PLLs re quire no external \ncomponents.  \nBB PLL \nThe AD9361 also contains a baseband PLL synthesizer that is \nused to  generate all baseband related clock signals. These include  \nthe ADC and DAC sampling clocks, the DATA_CLK signal (see \nthe Digital Data Interface  section), and all data framing signals. \nThis PLL is programmed from  700 MHz to 1400  MHz based on  \nthe data rate and sample rate requirements of t he system.  \nDIGITAL DATA INTERFACE  \nThe AD9361 data interface uses parallel data ports (P0 and P1) \nto transfer data between the dev ice and the BBP .  The data ports can  \nbe configured in either single -ended CMOS format or differential \nLVDS format.  Both formats can be configured in multiple  \narrangements to match system requirements for data ordering and  \ndata port connections.  These arrang ements include single port \ndata bus, dual port data bus, single data rate, double data rate, \nand various combinations of data ordering to transmit data \nfrom different channels across the bus at appropriate times. \nBus transfers are controlled using simple h ardware handshake \nsignaling. The two por ts can be operated in either bi directional \n(TDD) mode or in full duplex  (FDD) mode where half the bits \nare used for transmitting data and half are used for receiving data . \nThe interface can also be configured to use only one of the data \nports for applications that do not  require high data rates and \nprefer to use fewer interface pins.   \nDATA_CLK Signal \nRX data supplies the DATA_CLK  signal that the BBP can use \nwhen receiving the data.  The DATA_CLK  can be set to a rate th at \nprovides single data rate  (SDR) timing where data is sampled o n \neach rising clock edge , or it can be set to provide double data r ate \n(DDR) timing where data is captured  on both rising and falling \nedges.  This timing applies to operation using either a single port \nor both ports.   \nFB_CLK Signal  \nFor transmit data, the interface uses the FB_CLK signal as the \ntiming reference.  FB_CLK allows source  synchronous timing \nwith rising edge capture for burst control signals and either rising edge (SDR mode) or both edge capture (DDR mode) for transmit signal bursts. The FB_CLK signal must have the same \nfrequency and duty cycle as DATA_CLK.  RX_FRAME Signal  \nThe device generates an RX_FRAME output signal whenever the \nreceiver outputs valid data.  This signal has two mode s: level \nmode (RX_FRAME stays high as long as the data is valid) and \npulse mo de (RX_FRAME  pulses with a 50% duty cycle). Similarly,  \nthe BBP must provide a TX_FRAME signal that indicates the beginning of a valid data transmission with a rising edge.  Similar  \nto the RX_FRAME, th e TX_FRAME  signal can  remain  high \nthroughout the burst  or it can be pulsed with a 50% duty cycle.  \nENABLE STATE MACHINE  \nThe AD9361 transceiver includes an enable state ma chine ( ENSM) \nthat allows real -time control over the current state of the device.  \nThe device ca n be placed in several different states dur ing normal  \noperation, including  \n• Wait —power save, synthesizers disabled  \n• Sleep—wait with all clocks/BB  PLL disabled  \n• TX—TX signal chain enabled  \n• RX—RX signal chain enabled  \n• FDD —TX and RX signal chains enabled  \n• Alert —synthesizers enabled  \nThe ENSM has two possible control methods: SPI control and \npin control.   \nSPI Control Mode  \nIn SPI control mode, the ENSM is controlled asynchronously by writing SPI registers to advance the current state to the next \nstate.  SPI control is considered asynchronous to the DATA_CLK  \nbecause the SPI_CLK can be derived from a different clock \nreference and can still function properly.  The SPI control \nENSM  method i s recommended when real -time control of the \nsynthesizers is not necessary. SPI control can be used for real -\ntime control as long as the BBIC has the ability to perform \ntimed SPI writes  accurately .  \nPin Control Mode  \nIn pin control  mode , the enable function of the ENABLE  pin \nand the TXNRX pin  allow real -time control of the current state.  \nThe ENSM allows TDD or FDD operation depending on the \nconfiguration of the corresponding SPI register.  The ENABLE  \nand TXNRX pin control method is recommended if the BBIC \nhas extra control outputs that can be controlled in real time, allowing a simple 2 -wire interface to control the state of the \ndevice.  To advance the current state of the ENSM to the next  \nstate, the enable function of the ENABLE pin can be drive n by \neither a pulse (edge detected internally) or a level.   \nWhen  a pulse is used, it must have a minimum pulse width of \none FB_CLK  cycle . In level mode, the ENABLE and TXNRX \npins are also edge detected by the AD9361 and must meet the \nsame minimum  pulse width requirement of one FB_CLK cycle.   \n \n \nData Sheet AD9361\n \nRev. F | Page 35 of 36 In FDD mode, the ENABLE and TXNRX pins can be remapped \nto serve as real-time RX and TX data transfer control signals. In this mode, the ENABLE pin enables or disables the receive signal path, and the TXNRX pin enables or disables the transmit signal \npath. In this mode, the ENSM is removed from the system for \ncontrol of all data flow by these pins.  \nSPI INTERFACE \nThe AD9361 uses a serial peripheral interface (SPI) to \ncommunicate with the BBP . This interface can be configured \nas a 4-wire interface with dedicated receive and transmit ports, or it can be configured as a 3-wire interface with a bidirectional data communication port. This bus allows the BBP to set all device \ncontrol parameters using a simple address data serial bus protocol.  \nWrite commands follow a 24-bit format. The first six bits are \nused to set the bus direction and number of bytes to transfer. \nThe next 10 bits set the address where data is to be written. The final eight bits are the data to be transferred to the specified register address (MSB to LSB). The AD9361 also supports an LSB-first \nformat that allows the commands to be written in LSB to MSB format. In this mode, the register addresses are incremented for multibyte writes. \nRead commands follow a similar format with the exception that \nthe first 16 bits are transferred on the SPI_DI pin and the final eight bits are read from the AD9361, either on the SPI_DO pin \nin 4-wire mode or on the SPI_DI pin in 3-wire mode.  \nCONTROL PINS \nControl Outputs (CTRL_OUT[7:0]) \nThe AD9361 provides eight simultaneous real-time output signals \nfor use as interrupts to the BBP . These outputs can be configured to output a number of internal settings and measurements that the BBP can use when monitoring transceiver performance in different situations. The control output pointer register selects what \ninformation is output to these pins, and the control output enable \nregister determines which signals are activated for monitoring by the BBP. Signals used for manual gain mode, calibration flags, state machine states, and the ADC output are among the outputs \nthat can be monitored on these pins.  \nControl Inputs (CTRL_IN[3:0]) \nThe AD9361 provides four edge detected control input pins. In \nmanual gain mode, the BBP can use these pins to change the gain \ntable index in real time. In transmit mode, the BBP can use two \nof the pins to change the transmit gain in real time. \nGPO PINS (GPO_3 TO GPO_0) \nThe AD9361 provides four, 3.3 V capable general-purpose logic \noutput pins: GPO_3, GPO_2, GPO_1, and GPO_0. These pins \ncan be used to control other peripheral devices such as regulators \nand switches via the AD9361 SPI bus, or they can function as \nslaves for the internal AD9361 state machine. AUXILIARY CONVERTERS \nAUXADC \nThe AD9361 contains an auxiliary ADC that can be used to \nmonitor system functions such as temperature or power output. \nThe converter is 12 bits wide and has an input range of 0 V to 1.25 V . When enabled, the ADC is free running. SPI reads provide the last value latched at the ADC output. A multiplexer in front \nof the ADC allows the user to select between the AUXADC input \npin and a built-in temperature sensor. \nAUXDAC1 and AUXDAC2 \nThe AD9361 contains two identical auxiliary DACs that can \nprovide power amplifier (PA) bias or other system functionality. \nThe auxiliary DACs are 10 bits wide, have an output voltage range \nof 0.5 V to VDD_GPO − 0.3 V , a current drive of 10 mA, and \ncan be directly controlled by the internal enable state machine. \nPOWERING THE AD9361 \nThe AD9361 must be powered by the following three supplies: \nthe analog supply (VDDD1P3_DIG/VDDAx = 1.3 V), the \ninterface supply (VDD_INTERFACE = 1.8 V), and the GPO \nsupply (VDD_GPO = 3.3 V). \nFor applications requiring optimal noise performance, it is \nrecommended that the 1.3 V analog supply be split and sourced from low noise, low dropout (LDO) regulators. Figure 74 shows the recommended method.  \n \nFigure 74. Low Noise Power Solution for the AD9361 \nFor applications where board space is at a premium, and optimal noise performance is not an absolute requirement, the 1.3 V analog rail can be provided directly from a switcher, and a \nmore integrated power management unit (PMU) approach can \nbe adopted. Figure 75 shows this approach. \n \nFigure 75.
