The current consumption of the auxiliary output is the same as for the \nmain output.  \n6 The noise of the VCO is measured in open -loop conditions.  \n7 The synthesizer phase noise floor is estimated by measuring the in -band phase noise at the output of the VCO and subtracting 20  log N (where N is the N divider \nvalue) and 10  log FPFD.

Reference Input Stage \nRF N DIVIDER  \nThe RF N  divider  allows a division ratio in the PLL feedback \npath . The d ivision ratio is determined by  INT, FRAC and MOD \nvalues, which build up this divider . \nINT,  FRAC, MOD , AND R COUNTER RELATIONSHIP  \nThe INT, FRAC, and MOD values, in conjunc tion with the \nR counter, make it possible to generate output frequencies  \nthat are spaced by f ractions of the PFD frequency . See  the RF \nSynthesizer —A Worked Example  section for more information. \nThe RF VCO frequency (RF OUT) equation is  \nRF OUT = fPFD × (INT + (FRAC /MOD )) (1) \nwhere RF OUT is the output frequency of external voltage \ncontrolled oscillator (VCO).  \nINT is the preset divide ratio of the binary 16 -bit counter  \n(23 to 65535 for 4/5 prescaler, 75 to 65,535 for 8/9 prescaler ). \nMOD  is the preset fractional modulus (2 to 4095).  \nFRAC  is the numerator of the fractional division (0 to MOD − 1).  \nfPFD = REF IN × [(1 + D )/(R × (1 + T ))] (2) \nwhere : \nREF IN is the reference input frequency.  \nD is the REF IN doubler bit.  \nT is the REF IN divide -by-2 bit (0 or 1).  \nR is the preset divide ratio of the binary 10-bit programmable \nreference counter (1 to 1023 ). \n THIRD-ORDER\nFRACTIONAL\nINTERPOLATOR\nFRAC\nVALUEMOD\nREGINT\nREGRF N DIVIDER N = INT + FRAC/MOD\nFROM\nVCO OUTPUT/\nOUTPUT DIVIDERS TO PFD\nN COUNTER\n07325-006 \nFigure 17. RF INT Divider  \nINT N MODE  \nIf the FRAC = 0 and DB8 in Register 2 (LDF) is set to 1, the synthesizer operates in integer -N mode. The DB8 in Register 2 \n(LDF) mus t be set to 1 to get integer -N digital lock detect.  \nR COUNTER  \nThe 10 –bit R counter allows the input reference frequency \n(REF IN) to be divided down to produce the reference clock  \nto the P FD. Division ratios from 1 to 1023  are allowed.  \nPHASE FREQUENCY DETE CTOR (PFD) AND \nCHARGE PUMP  \nThe phase frequency d etector ( PFD ) takes inputs from the  \nR counter and N counter and produces an output proportional \nto the phase and frequency difference between them. Figure 18 \nis a simplified schematic of the phase frequency detector. The PFD includes a fixed delay element that sets the width of the antibacklash pulse, which is typicall y 3 ns. This pulse ensures \nthere is no dead zone in the PFD transfer function, and gives a \nconsistent reference spur level.  \nU3\nCLR2\nQ2 D2\nU2DOWNUP\nHIGH\nHIGHCP\n–IN+IN\nCHARGE\nPUMPDELAYCLR1Q1 D1\nU1\n07325-007 \nFigure 18.

MUXOUT Schematic \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTERS \nThe ADF4350  digital section includes a 10–bit RF R counter,  \na 16–bit RF N counter, a 12-bit FRAC counter, and a 12–bit \nmodulus counter. Data is clocked into the 32–bit shift register on each rising edge of CLK. The data is clocked in MSB first. Data is transferred from the shift register to one of six latches on the rising edge of LE. The destination latch is determined by \nthe state of the three control bits (C3, C2, and C1) in the shift \nregister. These are the 3 LSBs, DB2, DB1, and DB0, as shown in Figure 2. The truth table for these bits is shown in Table 5. \nFigure 23 shows a summary of how the latches are programmed.  \nTable 5.

First, the  new value is latched into the device by writing to the appropriate \nregister. Second, a new write must be performed on Register R0.  For example, any time the modulus value is updated, Register 0 \n(R0) must be written to, to ensure the modulus value is loaded correctly. Divider select in Register 4 (R4) is also double buf-\nfered, but only if DB13 of Register 2 (R2) is high.  \nVCO \nThe VCO core in the ADF4350  consists of three separate VCOs \neach of which uses 16 overlapping bands, as shown in Figure 20, \nto allow a wide frequency range to be covered without a large \nVCO sensitivity (K V) and resultant poor phase noise and spu-\nrious performance.  \nThe correct VCO and band are chosen automatically by the \nVCO and band select logic at power-up or whenever Register 0 \n(R0) is updated.  \nVCO and band selection take 10 PFD cycles × band select clock \ndivider value. The VCO V TUNE is disconnected from the output \nof the loop filter and is connected to an internal reference voltage. \n2.8\n2.42.01.6\n0.81.2\n0.4\n0\n1800\n20002200\n2400\n260028003000\n3200\n34003600\n3800\n400042004400\n4600\n07325-009FREQUENCY (MHz)VTUNE  (V)\n \nFigure 20. V TUNE  vs. Frequency \nThe use the R counter output as the clock for the band select \nlogic. A programmable divider is provided at the R counter output to allow division by 1 to 255 and is controlled by  Bits [BS8:BS1] in Register 4 (R4). When the required PFD frequency is higher than 125 kHz,  the divide ratio must be  \nset to allow enough time for correct band selection. \nAfter band select, normal PLL action resumes. The nominal \nvalue of K\nV is 33 MHz/V when the N-divider is driven from the \nVCO output or this value divided by D. D is the output divider \nvalue if the N-divider is driven from the RF divider output (chosen by programming Bits [D12:D10] in Register 4 (R4). The ADF4350  contains linearization circuitry to minimize  \nany variation of the product of I\nCP and K V to keep the loop \nbandwidth constant. \nData Sheet  ADF4350  \n \nRev. B | Page 13 of 34 The VCO shows variation of K V as the V TUNE varies within the \nband  and from band -to-band. It has been shown for wideband \napplications covering a wide frequency range (and changing \noutput dividers) that a value of 33  MHz/V provides the most \naccurate KV as this is closest to an average value. Figure 21 \nshows how K V varies with fundamental VC O frequency along \nwith an average  value for the frequency band.  Users may prefer \nthis figure when using narrowband designs . \n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6\n07325-133VCO SENSITIVITY (MHz/V)\nFREQUENCY (GHz) \nFigure 21. KV vs. Frequency  \nIn fixed frequency applications, the ADF4350 VTUNE may  \nvary with ambient temperature  switching  from hot to cold.  \nIn extreme cases, the drift causes VTUNE to drop to a very low \nlevel (<0.25  V) and can  cause loss of lock. This becomes an \nissue only at fundamental VCO frequencies less than 2.95 GHz and at ambient temperatures below 0 °C. \nIn cases such as these, if the ambient temperature decreases below 0°C, the frequency n eeds to be reprogrammed (R0 up dated) \nto avoid V\nTUNE dropping to a level close to 0  V . Reprogramming \nthe device  choose s a more suitable VCO band, and thus avoid s  \nthe low V TUNE issue. Any further temperature drops of more \nthan 20 °C (below 0 °C) also require further reprogramming. \nAny increases in the ambient temperature do not require repro -\ngramming.  OUTPUT STAGE  \nThe RF OUTA+ and RF OUTA− pins of the ADF4350 are connected \nto the collectors of an NPN differential pair driven by buffered \noutputs of the VCO, as shown in  Figure 22. To allow the user to \noptimize the power dissipation vs. the output power requirements,  \nthe tail current of the differenti al pair is programmable by  \nBits [D2:D1] in Register 4 (R4). Four current levels may be set. \nThese levels give output power levels of −4 dBm, −1 dBm, +2 \ndBm, and +5 dBm, respectively, using a 50 Ω resistor to  AV DD \nand ac coupling into a 50 Ω load. Alternatively, both outputs \ncan be combined in a 1 + 1:1 transformer or a 180 ° microstrip \ncoupler (see the Output Matchin g section) . If using the outputs \nindividually, the optimum output stage consists of a shunt \ninductor to V VCO. The unused complementary output must  \nbe terminated with a similar circuit to the used output.  \nAn auxiliary output stage exists on Pins RF OUTB+ and RF OUTB− \nproviding a second set of differential outputs which can drive \nanother circuit, or which can be powered down if unused.  The \nauxiliary output must be used in conjunction with the main RF \noutput. It cannot be used with the main output powered down.  \nAno ther feature of the ADF4350 is that the supply cur rent to \nthe RF output stage can be  shut down until the device  achieves \nlock as measured by the digital lock detect circuitry. This is enabled by  the mute till  lock detect (MTLD) bit in Register 4 (R4).  \nVCORFOUTA+ RFOUTA–\nBUFFER/\nDIVIDE-B Y-\n1/2/4/8/16\n07325-010 \nFigure 22.

Register 5 (R5) \n \nADF4350  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 18 of 34 REGISTER  0 \nControl Bits  \nWith Bits [C3:C1] set to 0 , 0, 0, Register 0  is programmed. \nFigure 24 shows the input data for mat for programming this \nregister . \n16- Bit INT Value  \nThese sixteen  bits set the INT value, which determines the \ninteger device  of the feedback division factor.  It is us ed in  \nEquation 1 (s ee the INT,  FRAC, MOD , and R Counter \nRelationship  section ). All integer values from 23  to 65,535  \nare allowed  for 4/5 prescaler . For 8/9 prescaler,  the minimum \ninteger value is 75.   \n12- Bit FRAC Value  \nThe 12 FRAC bits set the numerator of the fraction that is input \nto the Σ -Δ modulator. This, along with INT, specifies the new \nfrequency channel that the synthesizer locks to, as shown in the  \nRF Synthesizer —A Worked Example  section . FRAC values from \n0 to MOD − 1 cover channels over a frequency range equal to \nthe PFD reference frequency.  \nREGISTER  1 \nControl Bits  \nWith Bits [C3:C1] set to 0 , 0, 1, Register 1  is programmed. \nFigure 25 shows the input data for mat for programming  \nthis register . \nPrescaler Value  \nThe dual modulu s prescaler (P/P + 1), along with the INT, \nFRAC, and MOD counters, determines the overall division  \nratio from the VCO output  to the PFD input.  \nOperating at CML lev els, the prescaler tak es the c lock from the \nVCO output  and divides it down for the counters . It is based on \na synchronous 4/5 core. When set to 4/5, the maximum RF \nfrequency allowed is 3 GHz. Therefore, when operating the \nADF4350 above 3 GHz, this must be set to 8/9. The prescaler \nlimits the INT value , where P  is 4/5, NMIN is 23 and P is 8/9, \nNMIN is 75.  \nIn the ADF4350, PR1 in Register 1  sets the prescaler values.  \n12- Bit Phase Value  \nThese bits control what is loaded as the phase word. The word \nmust be less than t he MOD value programmed in R egister  1. \nThe word program s the RF output phase from 0° to 360 ° with a \nresolution of 360 °/MOD. See the Phase  Resync  section for more \ninformation. In most applications, the phase relationship between the RF signal and the reference is not important. In such applications, the phase value can optimize the fractional and \nsubfractional spur levels. See the  Spur Consistency and Fractional \nSpur Optimization  section for more information.  If neither the phase resync nor the spurious optimization \nfunctions are being used, it is recommended the PHASE  \nword be set to 1.  \n12- Bit Interpolator MOD Value  \nThis programmable register sets the fractional modulus. This  \nis the ratio of the PFD frequency to the channel step resolution \non the RF output. See the RF Synthesizer —A Worked Example  \nsection for more information.  \nREGISTER  2 \nControl Bits  \nWith Bits [C3:C1] set to 0 , 1, 0, Register 2  is programmed. \nFigure 26 shows the input data for mat for programming this \nregister . \nLow Noise and Low Spur Mode s \nThe noise modes on t he ADF4350 are contro lled by DB30 and \nDB29 in R egister  2 (see Figure 26). The noise modes allow the \nuser to optimize a design either for improved spurious perfor-mance or for improved pha se noise performance.  \nWhen the lowest spur setting is chosen, dither is enabled. This \nrandomizes the fr actional quantization noise so it resembles \nwhite noise rather than spurious noise. As a result, the device  is \noptimized for improved spurious performan ce. This operation \nis normally used when the PLL closed -loop bandwidth is wide, \nfor fast -locking applications. Wide  loop bandwidth is seen as a \nloop bandwidth greater than 1/10 of the RF OUT channel step \nresolution (f RES). A wide loop filter does not attenuate the spurs \nto the same level as a narrow loop bandwidth.  \nFor best noise performance, use the lowest noise setting option. \nAs well as disabling the dither, this setting also ensures that the \ncharge pump is operating in  an optimum region for  noise \nperformance . This setting is extremely useful where a narrow \nloop filter band width is available. The synthesizer ensures \nextremely low noise and the filter attenuates the spurs. The typical performance characteristics give the  user an idea of  \nthe trade -off in a typical W -CDMA  setup for the different  \nnoise and spur settings.  \nMUXOUT  \nThe on -chip multiplexer is controlled  by Bits [DB28:DB26]  (see \nFigure 26). \nReference Doubler  \nSetting DB25  to 0 feeds the REF IN signal directly to the 10 –bit \nR counter, disabling the doubler. Setting this bit to 1 multiplies \nthe REF IN frequency by a facto r of 2 before feeding into the \n10-bit R counter. When the do ubler is disabled, the REF IN \nfalling edge is the active edge at the PFD input to the fractional synthesizer. When the doubler is enabled, both the rising and falling edges of REF\nIN become  active edges at the PFD input.  \nData Sheet  ADF4350  \n \nRev. B | Page 19 of 34 When the doubler is enabled and the lowest spur mode is \nchosen, the in -band phase noise performance is sensitive to  \nthe REF IN duty cycle. The phase noise degradation can be as \nmuch as 5 dB for the REF IN duty cycles outside a 45% to 55% \nrange. The phase no ise is insensitive to the REF IN duty cycle  \nin the lowest noise mode  and when the doubler is disabled.  \nThe maximum allowable REF IN frequency when the doubler  \nis enabled is 30 MHz.  \nRDIV 2 \nSetting the DB24 bit to 1 inserts a divide -by-2 toggle flip -flop \nbetween the R counter and PFD, which extends the maximum \nREF IN input rate. This function allows a 50% duty cycle signal  \nto appear at the PFD input, which is necessary for cycle slip reduction.  \n10– Bit R Counter  \nThe 10 –bit R counter allows the input refere nce frequency \n(REF IN) to be divided down to produce the reference clock  \nto the  PFD . Division ratios from 1 to 1023  are allowed.  \nDouble Buffer  \nDB13 enables or disables double buffering of Bits [DB22:DB20] \nin Register 4. The Divider Select  section explai ns how double \nbuffering works.  \nCharge Pump Current Setting  \nBits [DB12:DB09]  set the charge pump current setting. This \nmust  be set to the charge pump current that the lo op filter  \nis designed with (see  Figure 26). \nLDF \nSetting DB 8 to 1 enables integer –N digital lock detect,  \nwhen  the FRAC part of the divider  is 0; setting DB8 to 0 enables \nfractional –N digital lock detect . Lock Detect Precision (LDP)  \nWhen DB7 is set to 0, 40 consecutive PFD cycles of 10 ns must \noccur befor e digital lock detect is set. When this bit is programme d \nto 1, 40 consecutive reference cycles of 6 ns must occ ur before \ndigital lock detect is set. This refers to frac tional -N digital lock \ndetec t (set DB8 to 0). With integer –N digital lock detect  activ ated \n(set DB8 to 1), and DB7 set to 0, then  five consecutive cycles of \n6 ns need to occur before digital lock dete ct is set. Wh en DB7 is \nset to 1, five consecutive cycles of 10  ns must occur.  \nPhase Detector Polarity  \nDB6  sets the phase detector polarity. When  using  a passive loop \nfilter or noninverting active loop  filter , this must  be set to 1. If \nusing an active filter with an inverting characteristic,  it must  be \nset to 0.  \nPower -Down  \nDB5 provides the programmable power -down mode. Setting this \nbit to 1 performs a power -down. Setting this bit to 0 returns the \nsynthesizer to normal operation. Wh en in software power- down \nmode, the device  retains all information in  the registers. On ly if the \nsupply voltages are removed  are the register  contents lost.  \nWhen a power -down is activated, the following events occur:  \n• The synthesizer counters  are forced to their load state \ncondi tions.  \n• The VCO is powered down.  \n• The charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n• The digital lock detect circuitry is reset.  \n• The RF OUT buffers are disabled . \n• The input register remains active and capable of loading and latching data.  \nCharge Pump Three -State  \nDB4 puts the charge pump into three -state mode when \nprogrammed to 1. It must  be set to 0 for normal operation.  \nCounter Reset  \nDB3 is the R counter and N c ounter reset bit for the ADF4350. \nWhen t his is 1, the RF synthesizer N counter and R counter  are \nheld in reset. For normal operation, this bit must  be set to 0.  \nADF4350  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 2 0 of 34 REGISTER 3 \nControl Bits  \nWith Bits [C3:C1] set to 0 , 1, 1, Register 3  is programmed. \nFigure 27 shows the input data for mat for programming this \nregister. \nCSR Enable  \nSetting DB18  to 1 enables cycle slip reduction. This is a method \nfor improving lock times . Note that the signal at the ph ase fre -\nquency detector (PFD) must have a 50% duty cycle for cycle slip \nreduction to work. The charge pump current setting must also \nbe set to a minimum. See the Cycle Slip Reduction for Faster \nLock Times  section for more information.  \nClock Divider Mode  \nBits [DB16:DB15] must be set to 1, 0  to activate PHASE resync \nor 0, 1 to activate fast lock. Setting Bits [DB16:DB15] to 0, 0 disables the clock divider. See Figure 27. \n12- Bit Clock Divider Value  \nThe 12 -bit clock divider value sets the timeout counter for \nactivation of PHASE r esync. See th e Phase  Resync  section for \nmore information. It also sets the timeout counter for fast lock. See the Fast -Lock Timer and Register Sequences section for \nmore information.  \nREGISTER  4 \nControl Bits  \nWith Bits [C3: C1] set to 1, 0, 0, Register 4  is programmed. \nFigure 28 shows the input data for mat for programming this \nregister . \nFeedback Select  \nDB23  selects the feedback from the VCO output to the \nN counter. When set to 1, the signal is taken from the VCO \ndirectly. When set to 0, it is taken from the output of the o utput \ndividers. The dividers enable covering of the wide frequency band (137.5 MHz to 4.4 GHz).  When the divider is enabled and the \nfeedback signal is taken from the output, the RF output  signals \nof two separately configured PLLs are in phase. This is useful in some applications where the positive interference of signals is required to increase the power.  \nDivider Select  \nBits [DB22:DB20] select the value of the output divider (see \nFigure 28). Band Select Clock Divider Value  \nBits [DB19:DB12]  set a divider for the band select logic  \nclock input. The output of the R counter , is by default , the  \nvalue used to clock the band select logic, but, if this  value is  \ntoo high (>125  kHz), a divider can be switched on to divide  \nthe R counter output to a smaller value (see Figure 28). \nVCO Power -Down  \nDB11 powers the VCO down or up depending on the chosen value.  \nMute  Till Lock Detect  \nIf DB10 is set to 1, the supply cur rent to the RF output stage is shut \ndown until the device  achieves lock as measured by the digital lock \ndetect circuitry.  \nAUX Output Select  \nDB9  sets the auxiliary RF output. The selection can be either \nthe output of the RF dividers  or fundamental VCO frequency . \nAUX Output Enable  \nDB8  enables or disables auxiliary RF output , depending on the \nchosen value.  \nAUX Output Power  \nBits [DB7:DB6]  set the valu e of the auxiliary RF output power \nlevel (see Figure 28). \nRF Output Enable  \nDB5 enables or disables primary RF output , depending  on the \nchosen value.  \nOutput Power  \nBits [DB4: DB3 ] set the value of the primary RF output power \nlevel (see Figure 28). \nREGISTER 5 \nControl Bits  \nWith Bits [C3:C1] set to 1, 0, 1, Register 5 is programmed. \nFigure 29 shows the input data for m for programming this \nregister . \nLock Detect P in Operation  \nBits [ DB23:DB22 ] set the o peration of the lock detect pin (see \nFigure 29).  \nData Sheet  ADF4350  \n \nRev. B | Page 21 of 34 INITIALIZATION SEQUE NCE  \nThe following sequence of registers is the correct sequence for \ninitial power -up of the ADF4350 after the correct application of \nvoltages to the supply pins:  \n• Register 5  \n• Register 4  \n• Register 3  \n• Register 2  \n• Register 1  \n• Register 0  \nRF SYNTHESIZER —A WORKED EXAMPLE  \nThe following is an example how to program the ADF4350 \nsynthesizer:  \nRF OUT = [INT + (FRAC /MOD )] × [fPFD]/RF divider  (3) \nwhere:  \nRF OUT is the RF frequency output.  \nINT is the integer division factor . \nFRAC  is the fractionality.  \nMOD  is the modulus.  \nRF divider  is the output divider that divides down the VCO \nfrequency.  \nfPFD = REF IN × [(1 + D) /(R × (1 +T))] (4) \nwhere:  \nREF IN is the reference frequency input.  \nD is the RF REF IN doubler bit.  \nT is the reference divide- by-2 bit (0 or 1).  \nR is the RF reference division factor .  \nFor example, in a UMTS system, where 2112.6 MHz RF frequency output (RF\nOUT) is required, a 10 MHz reference \nfrequency input (REF IN) is available, and a 200 kHz channel \nresolution (f RESOUT ) is required  on the RF output. Note that  \n the ADF4350 operates in the f requency range of 2.2 GHz to \n4.4 GHz. Therefore, the RF divider of 2 must  be used (VCO  \nfrequency = 4 225.2 M Hz, RF OUT = VCO frequency/RF d ivider = \n4225.2 MHz/ 2 = 2112.6 MHz).  \nIt is also important where the loop is closed. In this example,  \nthe loop is closed (see  Figure 30). \nfPFD\nPFD VCO\nN\nDIVIDER÷2\n07325-027RFOUT\n \nFigure 30. Loop Closed  Before Output Divider  Channel resolution (f RESOUT ) or 200 kHz  is required at the output \nof the RF divider. Therefore, channel resolution a t the output of \nthe VCO ( fRES) is to be twice the f RESOUT , that is 400  kHz.  \nMOD  = REF IN/fRES \nMOD  = 10 MHz /400 kHz = 25  \nFrom Equation 4 , \nfPFD = [10 MHz × (1 + 0)/1] = 10 MHz  (5) \n2112.6 MHz = 10 MHz × ( INT + FRAC /25)/2  (6) \nwhere:  \nINT = 422 \nFRAC  = 13 \nMODULUS  \nThe choice of modulus (MOD) depends on the reference signal \n(REF IN) available and the channel resolution (f RES) required at \nthe RF output. For example, a GSM system with 13 MHz REF IN  \nsets the modulus to 65 . This means the RF output resolution (f RES) \nis the  200 kHz (13 MHz/65) necessary for GSM. With dither off, \nthe fractional spur interval depend s on the modulus values chosen  \n(see Table 6). \nREFERENCE DOUBLER AND REFERENCE DIVIDE R \nThe reference doubler on -chip allows the input reference signal \nto be doubled. This is useful for increasing the PFD comparison \nfrequency. Making the PFD frequency higher improves the noise performance of the system. Doubling the PFD frequency usually improves noise performance by 3 dB. It is important to note that the PFD cannot operate  above 32 MHz due to a limi -\ntation in the speed of the Σ -Δ circuit of the N -divider.  \nThe reference divide- by-2 divides the reference signal by 2, \nresul ting in a 50% duty cycle PFD frequency. This is necessary \nfor the correct operation of the cycle slip reduction (CSR) function. See the  Cycle Slip Reduction for Faster Lock Times  \nsection for more information.  \n12-BIT PROGRAMMABLE MOD ULUS  \nUnlike most othe r fractional -N PLLs, the ADF4350 allows the \nuser to program the modulus over a 12 –bit range. This means \nthe user can set up the device  in many different configurations  for \nthe application, when combined with the reference doubler and \nthe 10 -bit R counter.  \nFor example , consider an application that requires 1.75 GHz RF \nand 200 kHz channel step resolution. The sy stem has a 13 MHz \nreference signal.  \nOne possible setup is feeding the 13 MHz directly to the PFD and programming the modulus to divide by 65. This results in the required 200 kHz resolution.  \nAnother possible setup is using the reference doubler to create 26 MHz from the 13 MHz input signal. This 26 MHz is then fed \ninto the PFD programming the modulus to divide by 130. This \nalso results in 200 kHz resolution and offers superior phase \nnoise performance over the previous setup.  \nADF4350  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 22 of 34 The programmable modulus is also  very useful for multi -\nstandard applications. If a dual -mode phone requires PDC  \nand GSM 1800 standards, the programmable modulus is a  \ngreat benefit. PDC requires 25 kHz channel step resolution, whereas GSM 1800 requires 200 kHz channel step resolution.  \nA 13 MHz reference signal can be fed directly to the PFD , and \nthe modulus can be programmed to 520 when in PDC mode (13 MHz/520 = 25 kHz).  \nThe modulus needs to be reprogrammed to 65 for GSM 1800 \noperation (13 MHz/65 = 200 kHz).  \nIt is important that the P FD frequency remain  constant (13  MHz). \nThis allows the user to de sign one loop filter for both setups \nwithout running into stability issues. It is important to remem -\nber that the ratio of the RF frequency to the PFD frequency principally affects  the loop filter design , not the actual channel \nspacing .  \nCYCLE SLIP REDUCTION  FOR FASTER LOCK TIME S \nAs outlined  in the Low Noise and Low Spur Mode  section, the \nADF4350 contains a number of features that allow optimization  \nfor nois e performance. However, in fast l ocking applications, \nthe loop bandwidth generally needs to be wide, and therefore, \nthe filter does not pr ovide much attenuation of the spurs. If  \nthe cycle slip reduction  feature is enabled , the narrow loop \nbandwidth is maintained for spur attenuation but faster lock \ntimes  are still possible . \nCycle Slips  \nCycle slips occur in integer -N/fractional -N synthesizer s when \nthe loop bandwidth is narrow compared to the PFD frequency. The phase error at the PFD inputs accumulates too fast for the PLL to correct, and the charge pump temporarily pumps in the wrong direction. This slows down the loc k time dramatically. \nThe ADF4350 contains a cycle slip reduction feature that exten ds \nthe linear range of the PFD , allowing faster lock tim es without \nmodifications to the loop filter circuitry . \nWhen the circuitry  detect s that a cycle slip is about to occur,  \nit turns on an extra charge pump current cell. This outputs a constant current to the loop filter, or removes a constant  \ncurrent from the loop filter (depending on whether the VCO tuning voltage needs to increase or  decrease to acquire the new \nfrequency). The effect is that the linear range of the PFD is increased. Loop s tability is maintained because the current  \nis constant and is not a pulsed current.  \nIf the phase error increases again to a point where another c ycle \nslip is likely, the ADF4350 turns on another charge pump cell. \nThis continues until the ADF4350 detects the VCO frequency \nhas g one past the desired frequency. The extra charge pump \ncells are turned off one by one until all the extra charge pump \ncells have been disabled  and the frequency is settled  with the \noriginal loop filter bandwidth.  Up to seven extra charge pump cells can be turned on. In most \napplications, it is enough to eliminate cycle slips altogether, \ngiving much faster lock times. \nSetting Bit DB18 in the Register 3 to 1 enables cycle slip \nreduction. Note that the PFD requires a 45% to 55% dut y cycle \nfor CSR to operate correctly.  If the REF\nIN frequency does not \nhave a suitable duty cycle, t he RDIV 2 mode ensure s that the \ninput to the PFD has a 50 % dut y cycle.  \nSPURIOUS OPTIMIZATIO N AND FAST LOCK \nNarrow loop bandwidths  can filter unwanted s purious signals, \nbut these usually have a long lock time. A wider loop bandwidth \nwill achieve fast er lock times, but a wider loop bandwidth may \nlead to increased spurious signals inside the loop bandwidth.  \nThe fast lock feature can achieve the same fast lock tim e as the \nwider bandwidth , but with the advantage o f a narrow  final loop \nbandwidth  to keep spurs low . \nFAST- LOCK TIMER AND REGIS TER SEQUENCES  \nIf using the fast -lock mode, a timer value must  be loaded into \nthe PLL to determine the duration of the wide bandwidth mode.  \nWhen Bits [DB16:DB15] in Register 3 are set to 0, 1 (fast -lock \nenable) , the timer value is loaded by  the 12 –bit clock divider \nvalue . The following sequence  must be programmed to use  \nfast lock : \n1. Initialization sequence (see the Initialization Sequence  \nsection) occurs only once after powering up the device . \n2. Load Register 3 by setting Bits [DB16: DB15 ] to 0, 1  and  \nthe cho sen fast -lock timer value [DB14:DB3]. Note that  \nthe duration  the PLL remains in wide bandwidth is equal \nto the fast- lock timer/f PFD.  \nFAST LOCK —AN EXAMPLE  \nIf a PLL has reference frequencies of 13 MHz and f PFD = 13 MHz \nand a required lock time of 50 µs, the PLL is set to wide bandwidth \nfor 40 µs.  This example assumes a modulus of 65 for channel \nspacing of 200 kHz.  This example does not account for th e time \nrequired for VCO band select . \nIf the time period set for the wide bandwidth is 40 µs, then  \nFast-Lock Timer Value  = Time in Wide Bandwidth  × fPFD/MOD  \nFast-Lock Timer Value  = 40 µs × 13 MHz /65 = 8 \nTherefore, a value of 8 must be loaded into the clock divider \nvalue in  Register  3 in Step 1 of the sequence described in the \nFast-Lock Timer and Register Sequences section.  \nData Sheet ADF4350\n \nRev.

To \nachieve the wider loop filter bandwidth, the charge pump current increases by a factor of 16 and to maintain loop sta- \nbility the damping resistor must be reduced a factor of ¼.  \nTo enable fast lock, the SW pin is shorted to the GND pin by settings Bits [DB16:DB15] in Register 3 to 0, 1. The following \ntwo topologies are available: \n\uf0b7 The damping resistor (R1) is divided into two values (R1 \nand R1A) that have a ratio of 1:3 (see Figure 31). \n\uf0b7 An extra resistor (R1A) is connected directly from SW , as shown in Figure 32. The extra resistor is calculated such \nthat the parallel combination of an extra resistor and the \ndamping resistor (R1) is reduced to ¼ of the original value of R1 (see Figure 32). \nADF4350\nCP\nSWC1 C2R2\nR1\nR1AC3VCO\n07325-018 \nFigure 31.

Fast-Lock Loop Filter Topology—Topology 2 \nSPUR MECHANISMS \nThis section describes the three different spur mechanisms that \narise with a fractional-N synthesizer and how to minimize them \nin the ADF4350 . \nFractional Spurs \nThe fractional interpolator in the ADF4350  is a third-order  \nΣ-Δ modulator (SDM) with a modulus (MOD) that is program-\nmable to any integer value from 2 to 4095. In low spur mode \n(dither enabled) the minimum allowable value of MOD is 50. \nThe SDM is clocked at the PFD reference rate (f PFD) that allows \nPLL output frequencies to be synthesized at a channel step \nresolution of f PFD/MOD. In low noise mode (dither disabled) the quantization noise from \nthe Σ-Δ modulator appears as fractional spurs. The interval between spurs is f\nPFD/L, where L is the repeat length of the code \nsequence in the digital Σ-Δ modulator. For the third-order \nmodulator used in the ADF4350 , the repeat length depends on \nthe value of MOD, as listed in Table 6. \nTable 6. Fractional Spurs with Dither Disabled  \nCondition (Dither Disabled) Repeat \nLength Spur Interval \nIf MOD is divisible by 2, but not 3 2 × MOD Channel step/2 \nIf MOD is divisible by 3, but not 2 3 × MOD Channel step/3 \nIf MOD is divisible by 6 6 × MOD Channel step/6 \nOtherwise MOD Channel step \nIn low spur mode (dither enabled), the repeat length is extend-\ned to 221 cycles, regardless of the value of MOD, which makes \nthe quantization error spectrum look like broadband noise. This may degrade the in-band phase noise at the PLL output  \nby as much as 10 dB. For lowest noise, dither disabled is a better \nchoice, particularly when the final loop bandwidth is low \nenough to attenuate even the lowest frequency fractional spur.  \nInteger Boundary Spurs \nAnother mechanism for fractional spur creation is the inter-\nactions between the RF VCO frequency and the reference \nfrequency. When these frequencies are not integer related (the \npoint of a fractional-N synthesizer) spur sidebands appear on the VCO output spectrum at an offset frequency that corres-ponds to the beat note or difference frequency between an integer multiple of the reference and the VCO frequency. These \nspurs are attenuated by the loop filter and are more noticeable \non channels close to integer multiples of the reference where the difference frequency can be inside the loop bandwidth, there-\nfore, the name integer boundary spurs. \nReference Spurs \nReference spurs are generally not a problem in fractional-N \nsynthesizers because the reference offset is far outside the loop \nbandwidth. However, any reference feed-through mechanism that bypasses the loop may cause a problem. Feed through of low levels of on-chip reference switching noise, through the \nRF\nIN pin back to the VCO, can result in reference spur levels as \nhigh as –90 dBc. PCB layout needs to ensure adequate isolation \nbetween VCO traces and the input reference to avoid a possible \nfeed through path on the board. \nADF4350 Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 24 of 34 SPUR CONSISTENCY AND FRACTIONAL SPUR \nOPTIMIZATION \nWith dither off, the fractional spur pattern due to the quantiza-\ntion noise of the SDM also depends on the particular phase \nword with which the modulator is seeded.  \nThe phase word can be varied to optimize the fractional and \nsubfractional spur levels on any particular frequency. Thus, a \nlook-up table of phase values corresponding to each frequency \ncan be constructed for use when programming the ADF4350 . \nIf a look-up table is not used, keep the phase word at a constant value to ensure consistent spur levels on any particular frequency. \nPHASE RESYNC \nThe output of a fractional-N PLL can settle to any one of the \nMOD phase offsets with respect to the input reference, where \nMOD is the fractional modulus. The phase resync feature in the ADF4350  produces a consistent output phase offset with respect \nto the input reference. This is necessary in applications where the \noutput phase and frequency are important, such as digital beam \nforming. See the Phase Programmability section to program a \nspecific RF output phase when using phase resync. \nPhase resync is enabled by setting Bits [DB16:DB15] in \nRegister 3 to 1, 0. When phase resync is enabled, an internal timer generates sync signals at intervals of t\nSYNC given by the \nfollowing formula: \ntSYNC = CLK_DIV_VALUE  × MOD  × tPFD \nwhere: \ntPFD is the PFD reference period. \nCLK_DIV_VALUE  is the decimal value programmed in \nBits [DB14:DB3] of Register 3 and can be any integer in the \nrange of 1 to 4095.  MOD  is the modulus value programmed in Bits [DB14:DB3] of \nRegister 1 (R1). When a new frequency is programmed, the second sync pulse after the LE rising edge resynchronizes the output phase to the reference. The t\nSYNC time is to be programmed to a value that is \nas least as long as the worst-case lock time. This guarantees the \nphase resync occurs after the last cycle slip in the PLL settling \ntransient.  \nIn the example shown in Figure 33, the PFD reference is 25 MHz \nand MOD = 125 for a 200 kHz channel spacing. t SYNC is set to \n400 μs by programming CLK_DIV_V ALUE = 80. \nLE\nPHASEFREQUENCYSYNC\n(INTERNAL)\n–100 0 100 200 1000 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n07325-020\nTIME (µs)PLL SETTLES TO\nCORRECT PHASE\nAFTER RESYNCtSYNC\nLAST CYCLE SLIP\nPLL SETTLES TO\nINCORRECT PHASE\n \nFigure 33.

B | Page 25 of 34 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nDIRECT CONVERSION MODULATOR \nDirect conversion architectures are increasingly used to implement \nbase station transmitters. Figure 34 shows how Analog Devices, \nInc., devices can implement such a system.  \nThe circuit block diagram shows the AD9761 TxDAC® being \nused with the ADL5375 . The use of dual integrated DACs, such \nas the AD9788 with the specified ±0.02 dB and ±0.001 dB gain \nand offset matching characteristics, ensures minimum error \ncontribution (over temperature) from this portion of the  \nsignal chain. \nThe local oscillator (LO) is implemented using the ADF4350 . \nThe low-pass filter was designed using ADIsimPLL ™ for a channel \nspacing of 200 kHz and a closed-loop bandwidth of 35 kHz.  The LO ports of the ADL5375  can be driven differentially from \nthe complementary RF\nOUTA and RF OUTB outputs of the ADF4350 . This gives better performance than a single-ended LO driver \nand eliminates the use of a balun to convert from a single-ended LO input to the more desirable differential LO input for the ADL5375 . At LO frequencies below 3 GHz some harmonic \nfiltering may be necessary to ensure best single sideband \nperformance.  \nThe ADL5375  accepts LO drive levels from −6 dBm to +7 dBm. \nThe optimum LO power can be software programmed on the \nADF4350 , which allows levels from −4 dBm to +5 dBm from \neach output. For more details on this circuit, consult CN-0134. \nThe RF output is designed to drive a 50 Ω load, but must be  ac-coupled, as shown in Figure 34. If the I and Q inputs are driven in quadrature by 2 V p-p signals, the resulting output power from the modulator is approximately 2 dBm.  \n \n07325-0212700pF 1200pF39nF680Ω\n360ΩSPI-COMPATIBLE SERIAL BUSADF4350VVCOVVCO\nCPGND AGND DGNDRFOUTB–RFOUTB+\nCPOUT1nF 1nF\n4.7kΩRSETLEDATACLKREFINFREFIN\nVTUNEDVDDAVDDCE MUXOUT10 28 16\n29\n1\n2\n3\n22\n8 31 9 11 18 21 27VDDLOCK\nDETECT\n51Ω\nAGNDVCO VCOM14\n15\n19 23 2425 30\nLD17\n20\n7PDBRF26\nSDGND TEMP VREF6 32\nSDVDD VP\n5 SW\n10pF 0.1µF 10pF 0.1µF 10pF 0.1µF4AD9761\nTxDACREFIO\nFSADJMODULATED\nDIGITAL\nDATA\nQOUTBIOUTA\nIOUTB\nQOUTA\n2kΩLOW-PASS\nFILTER\nLOW-PASS\nFILTER\nIBBP\nIBBN\nQBBP\nQBBNLOIP\nLOIN51Ω 51Ω\n51Ω 51Ω\nADL5375\nRFO QUADRATURE\nPHASE\nSPLITTER\nDSOPRFOUTA–RFOUTA+\n1312VVCO\n3.9nH 3.9nH\n1nF1nF\nLPF\nLPF\n \nFigure 34. Direct Conversion Modulator \n \nADF4350  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 26 of 34 INTERFACING  \nThe ADF4350 has a simple S PI-compatible serial interface for \nwriting to the device. CLK, DATA, and LE control the data \ntransfer. When LE goes high, the 32 bits that have been clocked \ninto the appropri ate register on each rising edge of CLK are \ntransferred to the appropriate latch. See Figure 2 for the timing \ndiagram and Table 5 for the register address table.  \nADuC7019 to ADuC7022 and ADuC7024 to ADuC7029 \nFamily Interface  \nFigure 35 shows the interface between the ADF4350 and the \nADuC7019/ ADuC7020/ ADuC7021/ ADuC7022/ ADuC7024/  \nADuC7025/ ADuC7026/ ADuC7027/ ADuC7028/ ADuC7029 \nfamily of analog microcontrollers. The ADuC7019 to ADuC7022 \nand ADuC7024 to ADuC7029 family is based on an AMR7 core , \nalthough the same interface can be used with any 8051 -based \nmicrocontroller. The microcontroller is set up for SPI master mode with CPHA = 0. To initiate the operation, the input/output  \nport driving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF4350 needs  \na 32-bit word. This is accomplished by writing four 8 -bit bytes \nfrom the microcontroller to the device. When the last byte is written, the LE input must  be brought high to complete \nthe transfer.  \nOn firs t applying power to the ADF4350, it needs six writes \n(one each to R5, R4, R3, R2, R1, R0) for the output to become active.  \nInput/output  port lines on the microcontroller are also used to \ncontrol  power -down (CE input) and to detect lock (MUXOUT \nconfigured as lock detect and polled by the port input).  \nWhen operating in the mode described, the maximum SPI transfer rate of the ADuC7023 is 20  Mbps. This means that  \nthe maximum rate at which the output frequency can be \nchanged is 833 kHz. If using a faster SPI clock just make sure the SPI timing requirements listed in Table 2 are adhered to.  07325-022ADuC7019 ADF4350CLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)SCLOCK\nMOSI\nI/O PORTS\n \nFigure 35.

The \nADF4350 needs a 32 -bit serial word for each latch write. The \neasiest way to accomplish this using the Blackfin family is to use \nthe autobuffered transmit mode of operation with alternate \nframing. This provides a means for transmitting an entire block of serial data before an interrupt is generated. Set up the word length for 8 bits and use three memory locations for each 32 -bit \nword. To program each 32 -bit latch, store the four 8 -bit bytes, \nenable the autobuffered mode, and write to the transmit register \nof the DSP . This last operation initiates the autobuffer transfer. \nMake sure the clock speeds are within the maximum limits \noutlined in Table 2. \n07325-023ADSP-BF527ADF4350CLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)SCK\nMOSI\nGPIO\nI/O FLAGS\n \nFigure 36.

On the PCB, there is to  be a minimum clearance \nof 0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the inner edges of the pad pattern. This ensures that shorting is avoided.  \nThermal vias can be used on the PCB thermal pad to improve the thermal p erformance of the package. If vias are used, they \nare to be incorporated in the thermal pad at 1.2  mm pitch grid. \nThe via diameter is to be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm, and the \nvia barrel is to be plated with 1 o z. of copp er to plug the via.  \nData Sheet  ADF4350 \nRev. B | Page 27 of 34 OUTPUT MATCHIN G \nThere are a number of ways to match the output of the ADF4350  \nfor optimum operation; the most basic is to use a 50 Ω  resistor to \nVVCO. A dc bypass capacitor of 100 pF is connected in series as  \nshown  in Figure 37. Because the resistor is not frequency \ndependent, this provides a good broadband match.
