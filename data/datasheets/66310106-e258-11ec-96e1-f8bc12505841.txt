Description\nThe AT89S52 is a low-power, high-performance CMOS 8-bit microcontroller with 8K \nbytes of in-system programmable Flash me mory. The device is manufactured using \nAtmel’s high-density nonvolatile memory te chnology and is compatible with the indus-\ntry-standard 80C51 instruction set and pinout. The on-chip Flash allows the program memory to be reprogrammed in-system or by a conventional nonvolatile memory pro-\ngrammer. By combining a versatile 8-bit CPU with in-system programmable Flash on \na monolithic chip, the Atmel AT89S52 is a powerful microcontroller which provides a highly-flexible and cost-effective solution to many embedded control applications.\nThe AT89S52 provides the following standard features: 8K bytes of Flash, 256 bytes \nof RAM, 32 I/O lines, Watchdog timer, two data pointers, three 16-bit timer/counters, a \nsix-vector two-level interrupt architecture, a full duplex serial port, on-chip oscillator, \nand clock circuitry. In addition, the AT89S52 is designed with static logic for operation \ndown to zero frequency and supports two software selectable power saving modes. \nThe Idle Mode stops the CPU while allowing the RA M, timer/counters, serial port, and \ninterrupt system to continue functioning. The Power-down mode saves the RAM con-\ntents but freezes the o scillator, disabling all other chip functions until the next interrupt \nor hardware reset.8-bit \nMicrocontroller with 8K Bytes In-System Programmable \nFlash\nAT89S52\n 1919D–MICRO–6/08\n 2\n1919D–MICRO–6/08AT89S52 2.

Pin Description\n4.1 VCC\nSupply voltage.\n4.2 GND\nGround.\n4.3 Port 0\nPort 0 is an 8-bit open drain bidirectional I/O port. As an output port, each pin can sink eight TTL \ninputs. When 1s are written to port 0 pins, th e pins can be used as high-impedance inputs. \nPort 0 can also be configured to be the multiplexed low-order address/data bus during accesses \nto external program and data memory. In this mode, P0 has internal pull-ups.\nPort 0 also receives the code bytes during Flash programming and outputs the code bytes dur-\ning program verification. External pull-ups are require d during program verification . \n4.4 Port 1\nPort 1 is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pull-ups. The Port 1 output buffers can \nsink/source four TTL inputs. When 1s are written to  Port 1 pins, they are pulled high by the inter-\nnal pull-ups and can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 1 pins that are externally being pulled low will source current (I\nIL) because of the internal pull-ups. \nIn addition, P1.0 and P1.1 can be configured to be the timer/counter 2 external count input \n(P1.0/T2) and the timer/counter 2 trigger input (P1.1/T2EX), respectively, as shown in the follow-ing table.\nPort 1 also receives the low-order address bytes during Flash programming and verification.\n4.5 Port 2\nPort 2 is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pull-ups. The Port 2 output buffers can \nsink/source four TTL inputs. When 1s are written to  Port 2 pins, they are pulled high by the inter-\nnal pull-ups and can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 2 pins that are externally being pulled low will source current (I\nIL) because of the internal pull-ups.\nPort 2 emits the high-order address byte during fetches from external program memory and dur-\ning accesses to external data memory that use 16-bit addresses (MOVX @ DPTR). In this \napplication, Port 2 uses strong internal pull-ups when emitting 1s. During accesses to external \ndata memory that use 8-bit addresses (MOVX @ RI), Port 2 emits the contents of the P2 Special \nFunction Register.\nPort 2 also receives the high-order address bi ts and some control signals during Flash program-\nming and verification.Port Pin Alternate Functions\nP1.0 T2 (external count input to Timer/Counter 2), clock-out\nP1.1 T2EX (Timer/Counter 2 capture/re load trigger and direction control)\nP1.5 MOSI (used for In-System Programming)P1.6 MISO (used for In-System Programming)\nP1.7 SCK (used for In-System Programming)\n 5\n1919D–MICRO–6/08 AT89S52\n4.6 Port 3\nPort 3 is an 8-bit bidirectional I/O port with internal pull-ups. The Port 3 output buffers can \nsink/source four TTL inputs. When 1s are written to  Port 3 pins, they are pulled high by the inter-\nnal pull-ups and can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 3 pins that are externally being pulled low will source current (I\nIL) because of the pull-ups.\nPort 3 receives some control signals for Flash programming and verification.\nPort 3 also serves the functions of various specia l features of the AT89S52, as shown in the fol-\nlowing table. \n4.7 RST\nReset input. A high on this pin for two machine cycl es while the oscillator is running resets the \ndevice. This pin drives high for 98 oscillator per iods after the Watchdog times out. The DISRTO \nbit in SFR AUXR (address 8EH) can be used to dis able this feature. In the default state of bit \nDISRTO, the RESET HIGH out feature is enabled.\n4.8 ALE/PROG\nAddress Latch Enable (ALE) is an output pulse for latching the low byte of the address during \naccesses to external memory. This pin is also the program pulse input (PROG ) during Flash \nprogramming. \nIn normal operation, ALE is emit ted at a constant rate of 1/6 th e oscillator frequen cy and may be \nused for external timing or clocking purposes. Note, however, that one ALE pulse is skipped dur-\ning each access to external data memory. \nIf desired, ALE operation can be disabled by setting bit 0 of SFR location 8EH. With the bit set, \nALE is active only during a MOVX or MOVC instru ction. Otherwise, the pin is weakly pulled high. \nSetting the ALE-disable bit has no effect if the microcontroller is in external execution mode.Port Pin Alternate Functions\nP3.0 RXD (serial input port)\nP3.1 TXD (serial output port)P3.2 INT0\n (external interrupt 0)\nP3.3 INT1  (external interrupt 1)\nP3.4 T0 (timer 0 external input)P3.5 T1 (timer 1 external input)\nP3.6 WR\n (external data memory write strobe)\nP3.7 RD  (external data memory read strobe)\n 6\n1919D–MICRO–6/08AT89S52 4.9 PSEN\nProgram Store Enable (PSEN)  is the read strobe to external program memory. \nWhen the AT89S52 is executing code fr om external program memory, PSEN  is activated twice \neach machine cycle, except that two PSEN  activations are skipped during each access to exter-\nnal data memory. \n4.10 EA /VPP\nExternal Access Enable. EA  must be strapped to GND in order to enable the device to fetch \ncode from external program memory locations starting at 0000H up to FFFFH. Note, however, that if lock bit 1 is programmed, EA\n will be internally latched on reset. \nEA should be strapped to VCC for internal program executions.\nThis pin also receives the 12-volt programming enable voltage (VPP) during Flash programming.\n4.11 XTAL1\nInput to the inverting oscillato r amplifier and input to the in ternal clock operating circuit.\n4.12 XTAL2\nOutput from the invert ing oscillator amplifier.\n5. Special Function Registers\nA map of the on-chip memory area called the Special Function Register (SFR) space is shown in \nTable 5-1 .\nNote that not all of the addresses are occupied, and unoccupied addresses may not be imple-\nmented on the chip. Read accesse s to these addresses will in gener al return random data, and \nwrite accesses will have an  indetermin ate effect.\nUser software should not write 1s to these unlisted locations, since they may be used in future \nproducts to invoke new features. In that case, the reset or inac tive values of the new bits will \nalways be 0.\nTimer 2 Registers: Control and status bits are contained in registers T2CON (shown in Table 5-\n2) and T2MOD (shown in Table 10-2 ) for Timer 2. The register pair (RCAP2H, RCAP2L) are the \nCapture/Reload registers for Timer 2 in 16-bit capture mode or 16-bit auto-reload mode.\nInterrupt Registers: The individual interrupt enable bits are in the IE register. Two priorities can \nbe set for each of the six interrupt sources in the IP register.\n 7\n1919D–MICRO–6/08 AT89S52\nTable 5-1.

The user should ALWAYS  initialize the DPS bit to the appropriate value before \naccessing the respective Data Pointer Register.\nPower Off Flag: The Power Off Flag (POF) is located at bit 4 (PCON.4)  in the PCON SFR.

Memory Organization\nMCS-51 devices have a separate address space for Program and Data Memory. Up to 64K \nbytes each of external Program and Data Memory can be addressed.\n6.1 Program Memory\nIf the EA  pin is connected to GND, all program fetches are directed to external memory.\nOn the AT89S52, if EA  is connected to VCC, program fetches to addresses 0000H through \n1FFFH are directed to internal memory and fe tches to addresses 2000H through FFFFH are to \nexternal memory.\n6.2 Data Memory\nThe AT89S52 implements 256 bytes of on-chip RA M. The upper 128 bytes occupy a parallel \naddress space to the Special Function Registers. This means that the upper 128 bytes have the \nsame addresses as the SFR space but are physically separate from SFR space.\nWhen an instruction accesses an internal location above address 7FH, the address mode used \nin the instruction specifies whether the CPU accesses the upper 128 bytes of RAM or the SFR \nspace. Instructions which use dire ct addressing access the SFR space.\nFor example, the following direct addressing instruction accesses the SFR at location 0A0H \n(which is P2).\nMOV 0A0H, #data\nInstructions that use indirect addressing access  the upper 128 bytes of RAM. For example, the \nfollowing indirect addressing instruction, where R0 contains 0A0H, accesses the data byte at address 0A0H, rather than P2 (whose address is 0A0H).\nMOV @R0, #data\nNote that stack operations are examples of i ndirect addressing, so the upper 128 bytes of data \nRAM are available as stack space.\n7. Watchdog Timer (One-time  Enabled with Reset-out)\nThe WDT is intended as a recovery method in situations where the CPU may be subjected to \nsoftware upsets. The WDT consists of a 14-bit counter and the Watchdog Timer Reset (WDTRST) SFR. The WDT is defaulted to disable from exiting reset. To enable the WDT, a user \nmust write 01EH and 0E1H in sequence to the WDTRST register (SFR location 0A6H). When \nthe WDT is enabled, it will incr ement every machine cycle while the oscillator is running. The \nWDT timeout period is dependent on the external clock frequency. There is no way to disable \nthe WDT except through reset (either hardware reset or WDT overflow reset). When WDT over-\nflows, it will drive an output R ESET HIGH pulse at the RST pin.\n7.1 Using the WDT\nTo enable the WDT, a user must write 01EH and 0E1H in sequence to the WDTRST register \n(SFR location 0A6H). When the WDT is enabled, t he user needs to service it by writing 01EH \nand 0E1H to WDTRST to avoid a WDT overflow. The 14-bit counter overflows when it reaches \n16383 (3FFFH), and this will reset the device. When the WDT is enabled, it will increment every \nmachine cycle while the oscillator is running. Th is means the user must reset the WDT at least \nevery 16383 machine cycles. To reset the WDT the user must write 01EH and 0E1H to WDTRST. WDTRST is a write-only register. The WDT counter cannot be read or written. When \n 11\n1919D–MICRO–6/08 AT89S52\nWDT overflows, it will generate an  output RESET puls e at the RST pin. The RESET pulse dura-\ntion is 98xTOSC, where TOSC = 1/FOSC. To make the best use of the WDT, it should be \nserviced in those sections of code that will periodically be executed within the time required to \nprevent a WDT reset.\n7.2 WDT During Power-down and Idle\nIn Power-down mode the oscillato r stops, which means the WDT also stops. While in Power-\ndown mode, the user does not need to service the WDT. There are two methods of exiting \nPower-down mode: by a hardware reset or via a level-activated external interrupt which is \nenabled prior to entering Power-down mode. When Power-down is exited with hardware reset, \nservicing the WDT should occur as it normally does whenever the AT89S52 is reset. Exiting \nPower-down with an interrupt is significantly different. The inte rrupt is held low long enough for \nthe oscillator to stabilize. When the interrupt is br ought high, the in terrupt is serviced. To prevent \nthe WDT from resetting the device while the interrup t pin is held low, the WDT is not started until \nthe interrupt is pulled high. It is suggested that the WDT be reset during the interrupt service for the interrupt used to exit Power-down mode.\nTo ensure that the WDT does not overflow within a few states of exiting Power-down, it is best to \nreset the WDT just before entering Power-down mode.\nBefore going into the IDLE mode, the WDIDLE bit in SFR AUXR is used to determine whether \nthe WDT continues to count if enabled. The WDT keeps counting during IDLE (WDIDLE bit = 0) \nas the default state. To prevent the WDT from resetting the AT89S52 while in IDLE mode, the user should always set up a timer that will peri odically exit IDLE, service the WDT, and reenter \nIDLE mode.\nWith WDIDLE bit enabled, the WDT will stop to count in IDLE  mode and resu mes the count \nupon exit from IDLE.\n8. UART\nThe UART in the AT89S52 operates the same way as the UART in the AT89C51 and AT89C52. For further information on the UART operation, please click on the document link below:\nhttp://www.atmel.com/dyn/resource s/prod_documents/DOC4316.PDF\n9. Timer 0 and 1\nTimer 0 and Timer 1 in the AT89S52 operate the same way as Timer 0 and Timer 1 in the \nAT89C51 and AT89C52. For further information on the timers’ operation, please click on the \ndocument link below:\nhttp://www.atmel.com/dyn/resource s/prod_documents/DOC4316.PDF\n 12\n1919D–MICRO–6/08AT89S52 10. Timer 2\nTimer 2 is a 16-bit Timer/Counter that can operate as either a timer or an event counter. The \ntype of operation is selected by bit C/T2  in the SFR T2CON (shown in Table 5-2 ). Timer 2 has \nthree operating modes: capture, auto-reload (up or down counting), and baud rate generator. The modes are selected by bits in T2CON, as shown in Table 10-1 . Timer 2 consists of two 8-bit \nregisters, TH2 and TL2. In the Timer function, the TL2 register is incremented every machine \ncycle. Since a machine cycle consists of 12 osc illator periods, the count ra te is 1/12 of the oscil-\nlator frequency.\nIn the Counter function, the register is incremented in response to a 1-to-0 transition at its corre-\nsponding external input pin, T2. In this function, the external input is sampled during S5P2 of \nevery machine cycle. When the sa mples show a high in one cycl e and a low in the next cycle, \nthe count is incremented. The new count value appears in the register during S3P1 of the cycle following the one in which the transition was de tected. Since two machine cycles (24 oscillator \nperiods) are required to recognize a 1-to-0 transition, the maximum count rate is 1/24 of the \noscillator frequency. To ensure that  a given level is sampled at leas t once before it changes, the \nlevel should be held for at least one full machine cycle.\n10.1 Capture Mode\nIn the capture mode, two options are select ed by bit EXEN2 in T2CON. If EXEN2 = 0, Timer 2 is \na 16-bit timer or counter which upon overflow sets bit TF2 in T2CON. This bit can then be used to generate an interrupt. If EXEN 2 = 1, Timer 2 performs the same  operation, but a 1-to-0 transi-\ntion at external input T2EX also causes the current value in TH2 and TL2 to be captured into \nRCAP2H and RCAP2L, respectively. In addition, the transition at T2EX causes bit EXF2 in T2CON to be set. The EXF2 bit, like TF2, can generate an interrupt. The capture mode is illus-trated in Figure 10-1 .\n10.2 Auto-reload (Up or Down Counter)\nTimer 2 can be programmed to count up or down when configured in its 16-bit auto-reload \nmode. This feature is invoked by the DCEN (Down Counter Enable) bit located in the SFR \nT2MOD (see Table 10-2 ). Upon reset, the DCEN bit is set to 0 so that timer 2 will default to \ncount up. When DCEN is set, Timer 2 can count up or down, depending on the value of the \nT2EX pin.Table 10-1.

Timer in Capture Mode\nFigure 10-2  shows Timer 2 automatically counting up when DCEN = 0. In this mode, two options \nare selected by bit EXEN2 in T2CON. If EXEN2 = 0, Timer 2 counts up to 0FFFFH and then sets \nthe TF2 bit upon overflow. The overflow also caus es the timer registers to be reloaded with the \n16-bit value in RCAP2H and RCAP2L. The va lues in Timer in Capture ModeRCAP2H and \nRCAP2L are preset by software. If EXEN2 = 1, a 16- bit reload can be triggered either by an \noverflow or by a 1-to-0 transition at external in put T2EX. This transition also sets the EXF2 bit. \nBoth the TF2 and EXF2 bits can generate an interrupt if enabled.\nSetting the DCEN bit enables Timer 2 to count up or down, as shown in Figure 10-2 . In this \nmode, the T2EX pin controls the direction of the count. A logic 1 at T2EX makes Timer 2 count up. The timer will overflow at 0 FFFFH and set the TF2 bit. This over flow also causes the 16-bit \nvalue in RCAP2H and RCAP2L to be reloaded into the timer registers, TH2 and TL2, \nrespectively.\nA logic 0 at T2EX makes Timer 2 count down. The timer underflows when TH2 and TL2 equal \nthe values stored in RCAP2H and RCAP2L. The underflow sets the TF2 bit and causes 0FFFFH \nto be reloaded into the timer registers.\nThe EXF2 bit toggles whenever Timer 2 overflow s or underflows and can be used as a 17th bit \nof resolution. In this operating mode, EXF2 does not flag an interrupt.OSC\nEXF2 T2EX  PINT2  PINTR2\nEXEN2C/T2  =  0\nC/T2  =  1CONTROL\nCAPTUREOVERFLOW\nCONTROLTRANSITION\nDETECTORTIMER  2\nINTERRUPT÷12\nRCAP2L RCAP2HTH2 TL2 TF2\nTable 10-2.

Baud Rate Generator\nTimer 2 is selected as the baud rate generator by setting TCLK and/or RCLK in T2CON ( Table \n5-2). Note that the baud rates for transmit and receive can be different if Timer 2 is used for the \nreceiver or transmitter and Timer 1 is used for the other function. Setting RCLK and/or TCLK puts Timer 2 into its baud rate generator mode, as shown in Figure 11-1 .\nThe baud rate generator mode is similar to the auto-reload mode, in that a rollover in TH2 \ncauses the Timer 2 registers to be reloaded with the 16-bit value in registers RCAP2H and RCAP2L, which are preset by software.\nThe baud rates in Modes 1 and 3 are determined by Timer 2’s overflow rate according to the fol-\nlowing equation.\nThe Timer can be configured for either timer or co unter operation. In most applications, it is con-\nfigured for timer operation (CP/T2\n = 0). The timer operation is different for Timer 2 when it is \nused as a baud rate generator. Normally, as a timer, it increments every machine cycle (at 1/12 the oscillator frequency). As a baud rate generator, however, it increments every state time (at \n1/2 the oscillator freque ncy). The baud rate fo rmula is given below.\nwhere (RCAP2H, RCAP2L) is the content of RCAP2H and RCAP2L taken as a 16-bit unsigned \ninteger.\nTimer 2 as a baud rate generator is shown in Figure 11-1 . This figure is valid only if RCLK or \nTCLK = 1 in T2CON. Note that a rollover in TH2 does not set TF2 and will not gen erate an inter-\nrupt. Note too, that if EXEN2 is  set, a 1-to-0 transition in T2EX will set EXF2 but will not cause a \nreload from (RCAP2H, RCAP2L) to (TH2, TL2). Thus, when Timer 2 is in use as a baud rate \ngenerator, T2EX can be used as an extra external interrupt.\nNote that when Timer 2 is running (TR2 = 1) as a timer in the baud rate generator mode, TH2 or \nTL2 should not be read from or written to. Under these conditions, the Timer is incremented \nevery state time, and the results of a read or write may not be accurate. The RCAP2 registers \nmay be read but should not be written to, because a write might overlap a reload and cause write and/or reload errors. The timer should be turned off (clear TR2) before accessing the Timer \n2 or RCAP2 registers.Modes 1 and 3 Baud Rates Timer 2 Overflow Rate\n16----------------------------------------------------------- - =\nModes 1 and 3\nBaud Rate---------------------------------------Oscillator Frequency\n32 x [65536-RCAP2H,RCAP2L)]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - =\n 16\n1919D–MICRO–6/08AT89S52 Figure 11-1. Timer 2 in Baud Rate Generator Mode\n12. Programmable Clock Out\nA 50% duty cycle clock can be programmed to come out on P1.0, as shown in Figure 12-1 . This \npin, besides being a regular I/O pin, has two al ternate functions. It can be programmed to input \nthe external clock for Timer/Counter 2 or to out put a 50% duty cycle clock ranging from 61 Hz to \n4 MHz (for a 16 -MHz operating frequency).\nTo configure the Timer/Counter 2 as a clock generator, bit C/T2  (T2CON.1) must be cleared and \nbit T2OE (T2MOD.1) must be set. Bit TR2 (T2CON.2) starts and stops the timer.\nThe clock-out frequency depends on the oscillato r frequency and the rel oad value of Timer 2 \ncapture registers (RCAP2H, RCAP2L), as shown in the following equation.\nIn the clock-out mode, Timer 2 roll- overs will not generate an interrupt.  This behavior is similar to \nwhen Timer 2 is used as a baud-rate generator. It  is possible to use Timer 2 as a baud-rate gen-\nerator and a clock generator simultaneously. Note, however, that the baud-rate and clock-out frequencies cannot be determined independently from one another since they both use \nRCAP2H and RCAP2L.OSCSMOD1\nRCLK\nTCLKRx\nCLOCK\nTx\nCLOCK\nT2EX  PINT2  PINTR2CONTROL"1"\n"1""1"\n"0"\n"0""0"TIMER  1  OVERFLOW\nNOTE: OSC.

Timer 2 in Clock-Out Mode\n13. Interrupts\nThe AT89S52 has a total of six interrupt vectors: two external interrupts (INT0  and INT1 ), three \ntimer interrupts (Timers 0, 1, and 2), and the serial port interrupt. These interrupts are all shown \nin Figure 13-1 .\nEach of these interrupt sources can be individual ly enabled or disabled by setting or clearing a \nbit in Special Function Register IE. IE also contains a global disable bit, EA, which disables all \ninterrupts at once.\nNote that Table 13-1  shows that bit position IE.6 is unimplemented. User software should not \nwrite a 1 to this bit position, since it may be used in future AT89 products.\nTimer 2 interrupt is generated by the logical OR of bits TF2 and EXF2 in register T2CON. Nei-\nther of these flags is cleared by hardware when the service routine is vectored to. In fact, the \nservice routine may have to determine whether it was TF2 or EXF2 that generated the interrupt, \nand that bit will have to be cleared in software.\nThe Timer 0 and Timer 1 flags, TF0 and TF1, are set at S5P2 of the cycle in which the timers \noverflow. The values are then polled by the circuitr y in the next cycle. However, the Timer 2 flag, \nTF2, is set at S2P2 and is polled in the same cycle in which the timer overflows.OSC\nEXF2P1.0\n(T2)\nP1.1\n(T2EX)TR2\nEXEN2C/T2  BIT\nTRANSITION\nDETECTOR\nTIMER  2\nINTERRUPTT2OE  (T2MOD.1)÷2TL2\n(8-BITS)\nRCAP2L RCAP2HTH2\n(8-BITS)\n÷2\n 18\n1919D–MICRO–6/08AT89S52 Figure 13-1.

Oscillator Characteristics \nXTAL1 and XTAL2 are the input and output, respectively, of an inverting amplifier that can be \nconfigured for use as an on-chip oscillator, as shown in Figure 16-1 . Either a quartz crystal or \nceramic resonator may be used. To drive the de vice from an external  clock source, XTAL2 \nshould be left unconnected while XTAL1 is driven, as shown in Figure 16-2 . There are no \nrequirements on the duty cycle of the external cl ock signal, since the input to the internal clock-\ning circuitry is through a divide-by-two flip-flo p, but minimum and maximum voltage high and low \ntime specifications must be observed.\n15. Idle Mode \nIn idle mode, the CPU puts itself to sleep while all the on-chip peripherals remain active. The mode is invoked by software. The content of the on-chip RAM and all the special functions regis-ters remain unchanged during this mode. The idle mode can be terminated by any enabled \ninterrupt or by a hardware reset. \nNote that when idle mode is terminated by a hardware reset, the device normally resumes pro-\ngram execution from where it left off, up to two machine cycles before the internal reset \nalgorithm takes control. On-chip hardware inhibi ts access to internal RAM in this event, but \naccess to the port pins is not inhibited. To e liminate the possibility of an unexpected write to a \nport pin when idle mode is terminated by a reset, the instruction following the one that invokes \nidle mode should not write to a port pin or to external memory.\n16. Power-down Mode \nIn the Power-down mode, the osc illator is stopped, and the instru ction that invokes Power-down \nis the last instruction executed. The on-chip RA M and Special Function Registers retain their \nvalues until the Power-do wn mode is terminated. Exit from Power-down mode can be initiated \neither by a hardware reset or by an enabled external interrupt. Reset redefines the SFRs but does not change the on-chip RAM. The reset should not be activated before V\nCC is restored to \nits normal operating level and must be held active long enough to allow the oscillator to restart \nand stabilize.\nFigure 16-1.

Program Memory Lock Bits \nThe AT89S52 has three lock bits that can be left unprogrammed (U) or can be programmed (P) \nto obtain the additional features listed in Table 17-1 .\nWhen lock bit 1 is programmed, the logic level at the EA  pin is sampled and latched during reset. \nIf the device is powered up without a reset, the latch initializes to a random value and holds that \nvalue until reset is activated. The latched value of EA  must agree with the current logic level at \nthat pin in order for the device to function properly.Table 16-1.

Programming the Flash – Parallel Mode\nThe AT89S52 is shipped with the on-chip Flash memory array ready to be programmed. The \nprogramming interface needs a high-voltage (12-volt) program enable signal and is compatible \nwith conventional third-party Flash or EPROM programmers.\nThe AT89S52 code memory array is programmed byte-by-byte.\nProgramming Algorithm: Before programming the AT89S52, the address, data, and control \nsignals should be set up according to the “Flash Programming Modes” (Table 22-1 ) and Figure \n22-1 and Figure 22-2 . To program the AT89S52, take the following steps:\n1. Input the desired memory location on the address lines.\n2. Input the appropriate data byte on the data lines.3. Activate the correct combination of control signals. 4. Raise EA\n/VPP to 12V. \n5. Pulse ALE/PROG  once to program a byte in the Flash array or the lock bits. The byte-\nwrite cycle is self-timed and typically takes no more than 50 µs. Repeat steps 1 through 5, changing the address and data for the entire array or until the end of the object file is reached.\nData\n Polling:  The AT89S52 features Data  Polling to indicate the end of a byte write cycle. Dur-\ning a write cycle, an attempted read of the last by te written will result in  the complement of the \nwritten data on P0.7. Once the write cycle has been completed, true data is valid on all outputs, \nand the next cycle may begin. Data  Polling may begin any time af ter a write cycle has been \ninitiated. \nReady/Busy : The progress of byte programming can also be monitored by the RDY/BSY  output \nsignal. P3.0 is pulled low after ALE goes high during programming to indicate BUSY . P3.0 is \npulled high again when programming is done to indicate READY.\nProgram Verify:  If lock bits LB1 and LB2 have not been programmed, the programmed code \ndata can be read back via the address and data lines for verification. The status of the individ-\nual lock bits can be verified directly by reading them back . \nReading the Signature Bytes:  The signature bytes are read by the same procedure as a nor-\nmal verification of locations 000H, 100H, and 200H, except that P3.6 and P3.7 must be pulled to \na logic low. The values returned are as follows.\n  (000H) = 1EH indicates manufactured by Atmel  \n  (100H) = 52H indicates AT89S52  \n  (200H) = 06H\nChip Erase:  In the parallel programming mode, a chip erase operation is initiated by using the \nproper combination of control signals and by pulsing ALE/PROG  low for a duration of 200 ns - \n500 ns.\nIn the serial programming mode, a chip erase operation is initiated by issuing the Chip Erase \ninstruction. In this mode, chip erase is self-timed and takes about 500 ms.\nDuring chip erase, a serial read  from any address location will return 00H at the data output.\n 22\n1919D–MICRO–6/08AT89S52 19. Programming the Flash – Serial Mode\nThe Code memory array can be programmed using t he serial ISP interface while RST is pulled \nto VCC. The serial interface consists of pins SCK,  MOSI (input) and MISO (output). After RST is \nset high, the Programming Enable instruction needs to be executed first before other operations can be executed. Before a reprogramming sequence can occur, a Chip Erase operation is \nrequired.\nThe Chip Erase operation turns the content of every memory location in the Code array into \nFFH.\nEither an external system clock can be supplied at pin XTAL1 or a crystal needs to be connected \nacross pins XTAL1 and XTAL2. The maximum seri al clock (SCK) frequency should be less than \n1/16 of the crystal frequency. With a 33 MHz oscillator clock, the maximum SCK frequency is \n2 MHz.\n20. Serial Programming Algorithm\nTo program and verify the AT89S52 in the serial programming mode, the following sequence is \nrecommended:\n1. Power-up sequence:\na. Apply power between VCC and GND pins.b. Set RST pin to “H”.\nIf a crystal is not connected across pins XTAL1 and XTAL2, apply a 3 MHz to 33 MHz clock to \nXTAL1 pin and wait for at  least 10 milliseconds.\n2. Enable serial programming by sending the Programming Enable serial instruction to pin \nMOSI/P1.5. The frequency of the shift clock supplied at pin SCK/P1.7 needs to be less than the CPU clock at XTAL1 divided by 16.\n3. The Code array is programmed one byte at a time in either the Byte or Page mode. The \nwrite cycle is self-timed and typically takes less than 0.5 ms at 5V.\n4. Any memory location can be verified by using the Read instruction which returns the \ncontent at the selected address at serial output MISO/P1.6.\n5. At the end of a programming session, RST can be set low to commence normal device \noperation.\nPower-off sequence (if needed):\n1. Set XTAL1 to “L ” (if a crystal is not used).\n2. Set RST to “L ”.3. Turn V\nCC power off.\nData Polling:  The Data  Polling feature is also available in the serial mode. In this mode, during \na write cycle an attempted read of the last byte written will result in th e complement of the MSB \nof the serial output byte on MISO.\n21. Serial Programming Instruction Set\nThe Instruction Set for Serial Programming fo llows a 4-byte protocol and is shown in Table 24-1 .\n 23\n1919D–MICRO–6/08 AT89S52\n22. Programming Interface – Parallel Mode\nEvery code byte in the Flash array can be programmed by using the appropriate combination of \ncontrol signals. The write operation cycle is self-t imed and once initiated,  will automatically time \nitself to completion.\nMost major worldwide programming vendors offer support for the Atmel AT89 microcontroller \nseries. Please contact your local programming vendor for the appropriate software revision.\nNotes: 1. Each PROG  pulse is 200 ns - 500 ns for Chip Erase.\n2.
