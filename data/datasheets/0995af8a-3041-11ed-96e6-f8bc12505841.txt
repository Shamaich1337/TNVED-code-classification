The below\nbullets detail the benefits brought by implementing the\nNCP1397A/B controller:\n•Wide frequency range : A high−speed V oltage Control\nOscillator allows an output frequency excursion from\n50 kHz up to 500 kHz on M lower and M upper outputs.\n•Adjustable dead−time : Due to a single resistor wired\nto ground, the user has the ability to include some\ndead−time, helping to fight cross−conduction between\nthe upper and the lower transistor.\n•Adjustable soft−start : Every time the controller starts\nto operate (power on), the switching frequency is\npushed to the programmed starting value by external\ncomponents (R Fmin//RFstart) and slowly moves down\ntoward the minimum frequency, until the feedback loop\ncloses. The soft−start discharge input (SS(dis))\ndischarges the Soft−Start capacitor before any IC restart\nexcluding the restart after Disable is released AND FB\nvoltage is higher than 0.3 V . The Soft−Start dischargeswitch also activates in case the Fault input detects the\noverload conditions.\n•Adjustable minimum and maximum frequency\nexcursion : In resonant applications, it is important to\nstay away from the resonating peak to keep operating\nthe converter in the right region. Thanks to a single\nexternal resistor, the designer can program its lowest\nfrequency point, obtained in lack of feedback voltage(during the startup sequence or in short−circuit\nconditions). Internally trimmed capacitors offer a /C00363%\nprecision on the selection of the minimum switchingfrequency. The adjustable upper stop being less precise\nto /C003612%.\n•Low startup current : When directly powered from the\nhigh−voltage DC rail, the device only requires 300 /C0109A\nto startup.\n•Brown−Out detection : To avoid operation from a low\ninput voltage, it is interesting to prevent the controller\nfrom switching if the high−voltage rail is not within theright boundaries. Also, when teamed with a PFC\nfront−end circuitry, the brown−out detection can ensure\na clean startup sequence with soft−start, ensuring thatthe PFC is stabilized before energizing the resonant\ntank. The BO input features a 28 /C0109A hysteresis current\nfor the lowest consumption.\n•Adjustable fault timer duration : When a fault is\ndetected on the Fault input or when the FB path is\nbroken, timer pin starts to charge an external capacitor.\nIf the fault is removed, the timer opens the charging\npath and nothing happens. When the timer reaches itsselected duration (via a capacitor on Pin 3), all pulsesare stopped. The controller now waits for the discharge\nvia an external resistor on Pin 3 to issue a new clean\nstartup sequence via soft−start.\n•Cumulative fault events : In the NCP1397A/B, the\ntimer capacitor is not reset when the fault disappears. It\nactually integrates the information and cumulates the\noccurrences. A resistor placed in parallel with thecapacitor will offer a simple way to adjust the discharge\nrate and thus the auto−recovery retry rate.\n•Overcurrent detection using Fault input : The fault\ninput is specifically designed to protect LLC\napplication in case of short circuit or overload.  In case\nthe voltage on this input grows above first threshold the\nItimer current source is activated and Fault timer\ncapacitor starts charging. Simultaneously the Soft−Startdischarge switch is activated to increase operating\nfrequency of the converter. The IC stops operation in\ncase the Fault timer elapses. The Fault input includesalso second fault comparator that:\n− Speeds up the fault timer capacitor charging by\nincreasing the I\ntimer1  current to I timer2  – NCP1397A\n− Latches off the device – NCP1397B\nThe second fault comparator thus helps to protect the power\nstage in case of hard short circuit (like shorted transformerwinding etc.)\n•Skip cycle possibility : The absence of the soft−start on\nthe Skip/Disable input (in case the V FB > 0.3 V) offers\nan easy way to implement skip cycle when power\nsaving features are necessary. A simple resistive dividerfrom the feedback pin to the Skip/Disable input, and\nskip can be implemented.\n•Broken feedback loop detection : Upon startup or any\ntime during operation, if the FB signal is missing, the\ntimer starts to charge timer capacitor. If the loop isreally broken, the FB level does not grow−up before the\ntimer ends charging. The controller then stops all pulses\nand waits until the timer pin voltage collapses to 1 Vtypically before a new attempt to restart, via the\nsoft−start. If the optocoupler is permanently broken, a\nhiccup takes place.\n•Common collector or common emitter optocoupler\nconnection options : This IC allows the designer to\nselect from two possible optocoupler configurations.\nVoltage−Controlled Oscillator\nThe VCO section features a high−speed circuitry allowing\noperation from 100 kHz up to 1 MHz. However, as a divisionby two internally creates the two Q and /Q outputs, the finaleffective signal on output M\nlower and M upper switches\nbetween 50 kHz and 500 kHz. The VCO is configured in\nsuch a way that if the feedback pin voltage goes up, the\nswitching frequency also goes up. Figure 25 shows thearchitecture of the VCO oscillator.\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n13Figure 25.

In LLCconfigurations, for circuits working above the resonant\nfrequency, a high precision is required on the minimum\nfrequency, hence the /C00363% specification. This minimum\nswitching frequency is actually reached when no feedbackcloses the loop. It can happen during the startup sequence,a strong output transient loading or in a short−circuitcondition. By installing a resistor from Pin 4 to GND, theminimum frequency is set. Using the same philosophy,wiring a resistor from Pin 2 to GND will set the maximum\nfrequency excursion. To improve the circuit protection\nfeatures, we have purposely created a dead zone, where the\nfeedback loop has no action. This is typically below 1.1 V .Figure 26 details the arrangement where the internal voltage\n(that drives the VCO) varies between 0 and 2.3 V.  However,\nto create this swing, the feedback pin (to which theoptocoupler emitter connects), will need to swing typically\nbetween 1.1 V and 5.3 V .\nFigure 26.

Please refer to the fault section for\ndetailed operation of this mode.\nAs shown on Figure 26, the internal dynamics of the VCO\ncontrol voltage will be constra ined between 0.5 V and 2.3 V,\nwhereas the feedback loop will drive Pin 6 (FB) between1.1 V and 5.3 V . If we take the default FB pin excursionnumbers, 1.1 V = 50 kHz, 5.3 V = 500 kHz, then the VCOmaximum slope will be:\n500 k/C004250 k\n4.2/C0043107 kHz/V\nFigures 27 and 28 portray the frequency evolution\ndepending on the feedback pin voltage level in a differentfrequency clamp combination.\nFigure 27.

Here a Different Minimum Frequency was\nProgrammed as well as a Maximum Frequency\nExcursion\nPlease note that the previous small−signal VCO slope has\nnow been reduced to 300k / 4.1 = 71 kHz / V on M upper and\nMlower outputs. This offers a mean to magnify the feedback\nexcursion on systems where the load range does not generate\na wide switching frequency excursion. Due to this option,we will see how it becomes possible to observe the feedbacklevel and implement skip cycle at light loads. It is important\nto note that the frequency evolution does not have a real\nlinear relationship with the feedback voltage. This is due to\nthe deadtime presence which stays constant as the switchingperiod changes.\nThe selection of the three setting resistors (F\nmax, Fmin and\ndeadtime) requires the usage of the selection chartsdisplayed below:\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n1550150250350450550\n1.9 11.9 21.9 31.9 41.9Figure 29.

Deadtime Resistor Selection\nORing capability and optocoupler connection\nconfigurations\nIf for any particular reason, there is a need for a frequency\nvariation linked to an event appearance (instead of abruptly\nstopping pulses), then the FB pin lends itself very well to the\naddition of other sweeping loops. Several diodes can easily\nbe used perform the job in case of reaction to a fault eventor to regulate on the output current (CC operation).Figure 33 shows how to do it.\nFigure 33. Thanks to the FB Configuration, Loop\nORing is Easy to ImplementVCC\nFB In1\nIn220 kVCO\nThe VCO configuration used in this IC also offers an easy\nway to connect optocoupler (or pulldown bipolar) directlyto the Rt pin instead of FB pin (refer to Figures 34 and 35).\nThe optocoupler is then configured as “common emitter”\nand the operating frequency is controlled by the current thatis taken out from the Rt pin – we have current controlleroscillator (CCO). If one uses this configuration it is needed\nto maintain FB pin voltage between 0.3 V and 1 V otherwise\nthe FB fault will be detected. The FB pin can be still used foropen FB loop detection in some applications – to do so it isneeded to keep optcoupler emitter voltage higher then 0.3 V\nfor nominal load conditions. One needs to take R\nFB\npulldown resistor into account when using this\nconfiguration. It is possible to implement skip mode usingSkip/disable input and emitter resistors R\nskip1 and R skip2.\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n16Figure 34.

The deadtime\ntechnique consists in inserting a period during which both\nhigh and low side switches are off. Of course, the deadtime\namount dif fers depending on the switching frequency, hence\nthe ability to adjust it on this controller. The option ranges\nbetween 100 ns and 2 /C0109s. The deadtime is actually made by\ncontrolling the oscillator discharge current. Figure 36portrays a simplified VCO circuit based on Figure 25.During the discharge time, the clock comparator is high and\ninvalidates the AND gates: both outputs are low. When thecomparator goes back to the low level, during the timing\ncapacitor Ct recharge time, A and B outputs are validated.\nBy connecting a resistor R\nDT to ground, it creates a current\nwhose image serves to discharge the Ct capacitor: we control\nthe dead−time. The typical range evolves between 100 ns\n(RDT = 3.5 k /C0087) and 2 /C0109s (R DT = 83.5 k /C0087). Figure 39 shows\nthe typical waveforms.\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n17Figure 36.

The purpose of the Soft−Start pin\nis to discharge Soft−Start capacitor before IC restart and in\ncase of fault conditions detected by Fault input.\nOnce the controller starts operation, the Soft−Start\ncapacitor (refer to Figure 37) is fully discharged and thus it\nstarts charging from the Rt pin. The charging currentincreases operating frequency of the controller above F\nmin.\nAs the soft−start capacitor charges, the frequency smoothly\ndecreases down to F min. Of course, practically, the feedback\nloop is supposed to take over the VCO lead as soon as the\noutput voltage has reached the target. If not, then the\nminimum switching frequency is reached and a fault isdetected on the feedback pin (typically below 300 mV).Figure 38 depicts a typical LLC startup using NCP1397A/B\ncontroller.\nFigure 37.

Therefore, whenthe skip/enable pin is released, no soft−start occurs to offerthe best skip cycle behavior. However, it is very possible tocombine skip cycle and true disable, e.g. via ORing diodes\ndriving Pin 8. In that case, if a signal maintains the\nskip/disable input high long enough to bring the feedbacklevel down (below 0.3 V) since the output voltage starts tofall down, then the soft−start discharge switch is activated.\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n1801.002.003.004.00\n04.008.0012.016.0\ntime in seconds−8.00−4.0004.008.00\nFigure 39.

Below agiven level, the controller blocks the output pulses, above it,\nit authorizes them. The internal circuitry, depicted byFigure 40, offers a way to observe the high−voltage (HV)\nrail. A resistive divider made of R\nupper and R lower, brings a\nportion of the HV rail on Pin 5. Below the turn−on level, the\n28 /C0109A current source IBO is off. Therefore, the turn−on\nlevel solely depends on the division ratio brought by theresistive divider.\nFigure 40.

This can happen in\npresence of an overvoltage (the feedback loop is drifting) or\nwhen an over temperature is detected. Thanks to the addition\nof a comparator on the BO pin, a simple external circuit canlift up this pin above V\nlatch (4 V typical) and permanently\ndisable pulses. The V CC needs to be cycled down below\n6.5 V typically to reset the controller.\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n20Figure 42.

As soon as the secondary optocoupler senses an\nOVP condition, or the NTC reacts to a high ambient\ntemperature, Q1 base is brought to ground and the BO pingoes up, permanently latching off the controller.\nProtection Circuitry\nThis resonant controller offers a dedicated input (Fault\ninput) to detect primary overcurrent conditions and protect\npower stage from damage.\nOnce the voltage on the Fault input exceeds 1.04 V\nthreshold the external timer capacitor starts charging byI\ntimer1  current. Simultaneously the Soft−Start discharge\nswitch is activated to shift operating frequency up to keepprimary current at acceptable level. In case the overloaddisappears fast enough the Soft−Start discharge switch is\nopen, I\ntimer1  current turned−off and timer capacitordischarges via an external parallel resistor. In case the\noverload lasts for more than timer duration (given by I timer,\nVtimer, Ctimer and R timer) the IC stops the operation and waits\nuntil the C timer will discharge to 1 V . The application then\nrestarts via So ft−Start.\nIn case of heavy overload, like transformer short circuit,\nthe primary current grows very fast and thus could reachdanger level prior the fault timer elapses. The NCP1397Btherefore features additional comparator (1.55 V) on theFault input to permanently latch the application and protect\nagainst destruction. Figure 44 depicts the architecture of the\nfault circuitry for NCP1397B controller.\nThe NCP1397A features second fault comparator as well\nbut in this case it doesn’t latches off the IC but speeds up the\nFault timer capacitor charging by turning on additionalcurrent source I\ntimer2  – refer to Figure 43. The NCP1397A\ncan thus be used in applications that have to recoverautomatically from any fault conditions.\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n21Figure 43.

If the\noutput loading increases above a certain level, the voltage on\nthis pin will pass the 1 V threshold and start the timer. If theoverload stays there, after a few tens of milli −seconds,\nswitching pulses will disappear and a protectiveauto−recovery cycle will take place. Adjusting the resistor\nR in parallel with the timer capacitor will give the flexibility\nto adjust the fault burst mode (refer to Figure 45).\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n23Figure 45.

Skip Cycle Can Be Implemented Via Two\nResistors on the FB Pin to the Fast Fault Input\nSkip/Disable\nThe Skip/Disable input is not af fected by a delayed action.\nAs soon as its voltage exceeds 0.66 V typical, all pulses areoff and maintained off as long as the fault is present. Whenthe pin is released, pulses come back and the soft−start isactivated (in case the V\nFB < 0.3 V).\nThanks to the low activation level, this pin can observe the\nfeedback pin via a resistive divided and thus implement skip\ncycle operation. The resonant converter can be designed tolose regulation in light load conditions, forcing the FB level\nto increase. When it reaches the programmed level, ittriggers the skip input and stops pulses. Then V\nout slowly\ndrops, the loop reacts by decreasing the feedback level\nwhich, in turn, unlocks the pulses, V out goes up again and so\non: we are in skip cycle  mode. As the feedback voltage does\nnot drop below 0.3 V the Soft−Start discharge switch is notactivated in this case. Please refer also to Figure 35 for skip\nmode function implementation when optocoupler isconnected directly to Rt pin.\nStartup Behavior\nWhen the V CC voltage increases, the internal current\nconsumption is kept below I strup. When V CC reaches the\nVCC(on)  level, output Mlower goes high first and then output\nMupper. This sequence will always be the same whatevertriggers the pulse delivery: fault, OFF to ON etc … Pulsing\nthe output M\nlower high first gives an immediate charge of the\nbootstrap capacitor. Then, the rest of pulses follow,delivered at the highest switching value, set by the R\nFstart\nresistor in parallel with R Fmin resistor on Pin 4. The\nsoft−start capacitor ensures a smooth frequency decrease toeither the programmed minimum value (in case of fault) orto a value corresponding to the operating point if thefeedback loop closes first. Figure 47 shows typical signals\nevolution at power on.\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n24\nFigure 47. At Power On, Output A is First Activated and the Frequency Slowly Decreases Based on the Soft−Start\nCapacitor Voltage\nFigure 47 depicts an auto−recovery situation, where the\ntimer has triggered the end of output pulses. In that case, the\nVCC level was given by an auxiliary power supply, hence its\nstability during the hiccup. A similar situation can arise if the\nuser selects a more traditional startup method, with anauxiliary winding. In that case, the V\nCC(min)  comparatorstops the output pulses whenever it is activated, that is to say,\nwhen V CC falls below 9.5 V typical. At this time, the V CC\npin still receives its bias current from the startup resistor and\nincreases toward V CC(on) . When the voltage reaches\nVCC(on) , a standard sequence takes place, involving a\nsoft−start. Figure 48 portrays this behavior.\nNCP1397A/B, NCV1397A/B\nwww.onsemi.com\n25\nFigure 48.
