The A port\nis designed to track V CCA. VCCA accepts any supply\nvoltage from 1.1 V to 3.6 V. The B port is designed\nto track V CCB. V CCB accepts any supply voltage\nfrom 1.1 to 3.6 V. The SN74AVC4T774  is optimized\nto operate with V CCA/VCCB set at 1.4 V to 3.6 V.\nIt is operational with V CCA/VCCB as low as 1.2 V.\nThis allows for universal low-voltage bi-directional\ntranslation between any of the 1.2-V, 1.5-V, 1.8-V, 2.5-\nV, and 3.3-V voltage nodes.\nThe SN74AVC4T774  is designed for asynchronous\ncommunication between data buses. The logic levels\nof the direction-control (DIR) input and the output-\nenable ( OE) input activate either the B-port outputs\nor the A-port outputs or place both output ports in\nthe high-impedance mode. The device transmits data\nfrom the A bus to the B bus when the B outputs are\nactivated, and from the B bus to the A bus when the\nA outputs are activated. The input circuitry on both A\nand B ports is always active and must have a logic\nHIGH or LOW level applied to prevent excess I CC and\nICCZ.\nDevice Information(1)\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN74AVC4T774PW TSSOP (16) 5.00 mm × 4.40 mm\nSN74AVC4T774RGY VQFN (16) 4.00 mm × 3.50 mm\nSN74AVC4T774RSV UQFN (16) 2.60 mm × 1.80 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the datasheet.\nMCU SPI Peripheral\nB1VCCA VCCB\nDIR1\nA11.8 V 3.3 V\n0.1 µF 0.1 µF\nSN74AVC4T774\nGNDCLK CLKDIR2\nDIR4\nB2 A2 SDO SDI\nB3 A3 SDI SDO\nB4 A4 CS CSGPIO1Pullup Resistors keep device disabled \nduring power up.

so that the control pins (DIR1, DIR2, DIR3, DIR4, and OE) are supplied by\nVCCA. This device is fully specified for partial-power-down applications using I off. The I off circuitry disables the\noutputs, preventing damaging current backflow through the device when it is powered down. The V CC isolation\nfeature ensures that if either V CC input is at GND, then both ports are in the high-impedance state.\nTo ensure the high-impedance state during power-up or power-down, OE should be tied to V CCA through a\npullup resistor; the minimum value of the resistor is determined by the current-sinking capability of the driver.\nSince this device has CMOS inputs, it is very important to not allow them to float. If the inputs are not driven to\neither a high V CC state, or a low-GND state, an undesirable larger than expected I CC current may result. Since\nthe input voltage settlement is governed by many factors (for example, capacitance, board-layout, package\ninductance, surrounding conditions, and so forth), ensuring that they these inputs are kept out of erroneous\nswitching states and tying them to either a high or a low level minimizes the leakage-current.www.ti.comSN74AVC4T774\nSCES693G – FEBRUARY 2008 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AVC4T774\n6 Pin Configuration and Functions\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9DIR1\nDIR2\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nDIR3\nDIR4VCCA\nVCCB\nB1\nB2\nB3\nB4\nGND\nOE\nA.

Pins An and\ncontrol pins (DIR1, DIR2, DIR3, DIR4 and OE) are support by V CCA and pins Bn are support by V CCB. The A port\nis able to accept I/O voltages ranging from 1.1 V to 3.6 V, while the B port can accept I/O voltages from 1.1 V to\n3.6 V. A high on DIR allows data transmission from An to Bn and a low on DIR allows data transmission from B\nto A when OE is set to low. When OE is set to high, both An and Bn are in the high-impedance state.\n9.2 Functional Block Diagram\nDIR1\nA1OE\nB1\nFigure 9-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for\ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\nThe SN74AVC4T774  device can be used in level-translation applications for interfacing devices or systems\noperating at different interface voltages with one another. The SN74AVC4T774  device is ideal for use in\napplications where a push-pull driver is connected to the data I/Os.

For a valid logic high, the value must exceed the V IH of the input port. For a valid logic low,\nthe value must be less than the V IL of the input port.\n• Output voltage range\n– Use the supply voltage of the device that the SN74AVC4T774 device is driving to determine the output\nvoltage range.\n10.2.3 Application Curve\nFigure 10-2. Translation Up (1.2 V to 3.3 V) at 2.5 MHzwww.ti.comSN74AVC4T774\nSCES693G – FEBRUARY 2008 – REVISED MAY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AVC4T774\n11 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe SN74AVC4T774  device uses two separate configurable power-supply rails, V CCA and V CCB. VCCA accepts\nany supply voltage from 1.1 V to 3.6 V and V CCB accepts any supply voltage from 1.1 V to 3.6 V. The A port\nand B port are designed to track V CCA and V CCB respectively allowing for low-voltage, bi-directional translation\nbetween any of the 1.2-V, 1.5-V, 1.8-V, 2.5-V and 3.3-V voltage nodes.\nThe output-enable OE input circuit is designed so that it is supplied by V CCA and when the OE input is high,\nall outputs are placed in the high-impedance state. To ensure the high-impedance state of the outputs during\npower-up or power-down, the OE input pin must be tied to V CCA through a pullup resistor and must not be\nenabled until V CCA and V CCB are fully ramped and stable. The minimum value of the pullup resistor to V CCA is\ndetermined by the current-sinking capability of the driver.\n12 Layout\n12.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo ensure reliability of the device, following common printed-circuit board layout guidelines are recommended:\n• Bypass capacitors should be used on power supplies.\n• Short trace lengths should be used to avoid excessive loading.\n• Placing pads on the signal paths for loading capacitors or pullup resistors to help adjust rise and fall times of\nsignals depending on the system requirementsSN74AVC4T774\nSCES693G – FEBRUARY 2008 – REVISED MAY 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74AVC4T774\n12.2 Layout Example\n1\n2\n3\n416\nB1 A1DIR1\nVCCB DIR2LEGEND\nVIA to Power Plane\nVIA to GND Plane (Inner Layer)Polygonal Copper Pour\nFrom\nController15\n14\n13VCCA\n5\n6\n7\n812\nGNDA3\nB4A2 B2\nB3\nA4 11\n10\n9VCCA\nOEVCCA\nBypass\nCapacitor\nFrom\nControllerTo\nSystem\nTo\nControllerFrom\nSystem\nSN74AVC4T774VCCB\nKeep OE high until V CCAand\nVCCBare powered upDIR3\nDIR4From\nController\nVCCA\nVCCATo\nSystem\nTo\nSystem\nV\nCCA\nFigure 12-1.

#### Description:
The SN74AVC4T774 is a 4-bit dual-supply bus transceiver designed for voltage-level shifting and bi-directional data transmission. It features independent direction control inputs for each channel, allowing for flexible communication between devices operating at different voltage levels. The device can handle input/output voltages ranging from 1.1 V to 3.6 V, making it suitable for interfacing low-voltage systems.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Personal Electronics:** Used in devices that require communication between components operating at different voltage levels.
- **Industrial Applications:** Facilitates data transfer in industrial control systems where different voltage standards are present.
- **Enterprise Systems:** Ideal for server and networking equipment that require reliable data communication across various voltage domains.
- **Telecommunications:** Utilized in telecom equipment for level translation between different signaling standards.

This component is particularly useful in applications where devices with different voltage levels need to communicate, such as interfacing microcontrollers with sensors or other peripherals that operate at varying voltage levels.
