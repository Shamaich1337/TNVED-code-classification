The input range of the ADC is ﬁ  xed at 2.75V\nP-P.\nThe LTC2217 is perfect for demanding communications \napplications, with AC performance that includes 81.3dBFS Noise Floor and 100dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). Ultra low jitter of 85fs\nRMS allows undersampling \nof high input frequencies while maintaining excellent noise performance. Maximum DC speciﬁ  cations include ±3.5LSB \nINL, ±1LSB DNL (no missing codes). \nThe digital output can be either differential LVDS or \nsingle-ended CMOS. There are two format options for the CMOS outputs: a single bus running at the full data rate or demultiplexed buses running at half data rate. A separate output power supply allows the CMOS output swing to range from 0.5V to 3.6V. \nThe ENC\n+ and ENC– inputs may be driven differentially \nor single-ended with a sine wave, PECL, LVDS, TTL or CMOS inputs. An optional clock duty cycle stabilizer al-lows high performance at full speed with a wide range of clock duty cycles.■ Telecommunications\n■ Receivers\n■ Cellular Base Stations\n■ Spectrum Analysis\n■ Imaging Systems\n■ ATE■ Sample Rate: 105Msps\n■ 81.3dBFS Noise Floor\n■ 100dB SFDR\n■ SFDR >90dB at 70MHz\n■ 85fs RMS Jitter\n■ 2.75V P-P Input Range\n■ 400MHz Full Power Bandwidth S/H\n■ Optional Internal Dither\n■ Optional Data Output Randomizer\n■ LVDS or CMOS Outputs\n■ Single 3.3V Supply\n■ Power Dissipation: 1.19W\n■ Clock Duty Cycle Stabilizer\n■ Pin Compatible with LTC2208\n■ 64-Pin (9mm × 9mm) QFN Package\n, LT, LTC and LTM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.\nAll other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Functional Block DiagramBLOCK DIAGRAM\nLTC2217\n172217fDYNAMIC PERFORMANCE\nSignal-to-Noise Plus Distortion Ratio\nThe signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio [S/(N+D)] is the \nratio between the RMS amplitude of the fundamental input frequency and the RMS amplitude of all other frequency components at the ADC output. The output is band lim-ited to frequencies above DC to below half the sampling frequency (Nyquist Frequency). \nSignal-to-Noise Ratio\nThe signal-to-noise (SNR) is the ratio between the RMS \namplitude of the fundamental input frequency and the RMS amplitude of all other frequency components, except the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve harmonics. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion\nTotal harmonic distortion is the ratio of the RMS sum of \nall harmonics of the input signal to the fundamental itself. The out-of-band harmonics alias into the frequency band between DC and half the sampling frequency (Nyquist Frequency). THD is expressed as:\n \nTHD LogVVV V\nVN=+++ …()⎛\n⎝⎜\n⎜\n⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n⎟\n⎟–2022\n32\n422\n1\nwhere V 1 is the RMS amplitude of the fundamental fre-\nquency and V 2 through V N are the amplitudes of the second \nthrough nth harmonics. \nIntermodulation Distortion\nIf the ADC input signal consists of more than one spectral \ncomponent, the ADC transfer function nonlinearity can produce intermodulation distortion (IMD) in addition to THD.\n IMD is the change in one sinusoidal input caused by the presence of another sinusoidal input at a different \nfrequency.\nIf two pure sine waves of frequencies fa and fb are applied \nto the ADC input, nonlinearities in the ADC transfer function can create distortion products at the sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where m and n = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n \nFor example, the 3rd order IMD terms include (2fa + fb), (fa + 2fb), (2fa - fb) and (fa - 2fb). The 3rd order IMD is deﬁ  ned as the ratio of the RMS value of either input tone to the RMS value of the largest 3rd order IMD product.\nSpurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\nThe ratio of the RMS input signal amplitude to the RMS \nvalue of the peak spurious spectral component expressed in dBc. SFDR may also be calculated relative to full scale and expressed in dBFS.\nFull Power Bandwidth\nThe Full Power bandwidth is that input frequency at which \nthe amplitude of the reconstructed fundamental is reduced by 3dB from a full scale input signal. \nAperture Delay Time\nThe time from when a rising ENC\n+ equals the ENC– voltage \nto the instant that the input signal is held by the sample- and-hold circuit. \nAperture Delay Jitter\nThe variation in the aperture delay time from conversion \nto conversion. This random variation will result in noise when sampling an AC input. The signal-to-noise ratio term due to the jitter alone will be: \n SNR\nJITTER = –20log (2 π • fIN • tJITTER )\nThis formula states SNR due to jitter alone  at any amplitude \nin terms of dBc.OPERATION\nLTC2217\n182217fCONVERTER OPERATION\nThe LTC2217 is a CMOS pipelined multistep converter with \na low noise front-end. As shown in Figure 1, the converter has ﬁ  ve pipelined ADC stages; a sampled analog input will result in a digitized value seven cycles later (see the Timing Diagram section). The analog input is differential for improved common mode noise immunity and to maximize the input range. Additionally, the differential input drive will reduce even order harmonics of the sample and hold circuit. The encode input is also differential for improved common mode noise immunity. \nThe LTC2217 has two phases of operation, determined \nby the state of the differential ENC\n+/ENC– input pins. For \nbrevity, the text will refer to ENC+ greater than ENC– as \nENC high and ENC+ less than ENC– as ENC low.\nEach pipelined stage shown in Figure 1 contains an ADC, \na reconstruction DAC and an interstage ampliﬁ  er. In \noperation, the ADC quantizes the input to the stage and the quantized value is subtracted from the input by the DAC to produce a residue. The residue is ampliﬁ  ed and \noutput by the residue ampliﬁ  er. Successive stages oper-\nate out of phase so that when odd stages are outputting their residue, the even stages are acquiring that residue and vice versa.\nWhen ENC is low, the analog input is sampled differen-\ntially directly onto the input sample-and-hold capacitors, inside the “input S/H” shown in the block diagram. At the instant that ENC transitions from low to high, the voltage on the sample capacitors is held. While ENC is high, the held input voltage is buffered by the S/H ampliﬁ  er which \ndrives the ﬁ  rst pipelined ADC stage. The ﬁ  rst stage acquires \nthe output of the S/H ampliﬁ  er during the high phase of \nENC. When ENC goes back low, the ﬁ  rst stage produces its residue which is acquired by the second stage. At the same time, the input S/H goes back to acquiring the analog input. When ENC goes high, the second stage produces its residue which is acquired by the third stage. An identical process is repeated for the third and fourth stages, resulting in a fourth stage residue that is sent to the ﬁ  fth stage for ﬁ  nal evaluation.\nEach ADC stage following the ﬁ  rst has additional range to \naccommodate ﬂ  ash and ampliﬁ  er offset errors. Results \nfrom all of the ADC stages are digitally delayed such that the results can be properly combined in the correction logic before being sent to the output buffer.SAMPLE/HOLD OPERATION AND INPUT DRIVE\nSample/Hold Operation\nFigure 2 shows an equivalent circuit for the LTC2217 CMOS \ndifferential sample and hold. The differential analog inputs are sampled directly onto sampling capacitors (C\nSAMPLE ) \nthrough NMOS transitors. The capacitors shown attached to each input (C\nPARASITIC ) are the summation of all other \ncapacitance associated with each input. \nDuring the sample phase when ENC is low, the NMOS \ntransistors connect the analog inputs to the sampling capacitors and they charge to, and track the differential input voltage. When ENC transitions from low to high, the sampled input voltage is held on the sampling capacitors. During the hold phase when ENC is high, the sampling capacitors are disconnected from the input and the held voltage is passed to the ADC core for processing. As ENC transitions for high to low, the inputs are reconnected to the sampling capacitors to acquire a new sample. Since the sampling capacitors still hold the previous sample, a charging glitch proportional to the change in voltage between samples will be seen at this time. If the change between the last sample and the new sample is small, the charging glitch seen at the input will be small. If the \nFigure 2.

Each input should swing \n±0.6875V for the 2.75V range, around a common mode voltage of 1.575V. The V\nCM output pin (Pin 3) is designed \nto provide the common mode bias level. V CM can be tied \ndirectly to the center tap of a transformer to set the DC input level or as a reference level to an op amp differential driver circuit. The V\nCM pin must be bypassed to ground \nclose to the ADC with 2.2μF or greater.\nInput Drive Impedance\nAs with all high performance, high speed ADCs the dynamic \nperformance of the LTC2217 can be inﬂ  uenced by the input \ndrive circuitry, particularly the second and third harmonics. Source impedance and input reactance can inﬂ  uence SFDR. \nAt the falling edge of ENC the sample and hold circuit will connect the sampling capacitor to the input pin and start the sampling period. The sampling period ends when ENC rises, \nholding the sampled input on the sampling capacitor. Ide-ally, the input circuitry should be fast enough to fully charge the sampling capacitor during the sampling period 1/(2 • f\nENCODE ); however, this is not always possible and \nthe incomplete settling may degrade the SFDR. The sam-pling glitch has been designed to be as linear as possible to minimize the effects of incomplete settling.\nFor the best performance it is recommended to have a \nsource impedance of 100 Ω or less for each input. The \nsource impedance should be matched for the differential inputs. Poor matching will result in higher even order harmonics, especially the second.\nINPUT DRIVE CIRCUITS\nInput Filtering\nA ﬁ  rst-order RC low-pass ﬁ  lter at the input of the ADC can \nserve two functions: limit the noise from input circuitry and provide isolation from ADC S/H switching. The LTC2217 has a very broadband S/H circuit, DC to 400MHz; it can \nbe used in a wide range of applications; therefore, it is not possible to provide a single recommended RC ﬁ  lter. \nFigures 3 and 4 show two examples of input RC ﬁ  ltering for \ntwo ranges of input frequencies. In general it is desirable to make the capacitors as large as can be tolerated—this will help suppress random noise as well as noise coupled from the digital circuitry. The LTC2217 does not require any input ﬁ  lter to achieve data sheet speciﬁ  cations; however, no ﬁ  ltering will put more stringent noise requirements on the input drive circuitry.\nTransformer Coupled Circuits\nFigure 3 shows the LTC2217 being driven by an RF trans-\nformer with a center-tapped secondary. The secondary center tap is DC biased with V\nCM, setting the ADC input \nsignal at its optimum DC level. Figure 3 shows a 1:1 turns ratio transformer. Other turns ratios can be used; however, as the turns ratio increases so does the impedance seen by the ADC. Source impedance greater than 50 Ω can reduce \nthe input bandwidth and increase high frequency distor-tion. A disadvantage of using a transformer is the loss of low frequency response. Most small RF transformers have poor performance at frequencies below 1MHz. \nCenter-tapped transformers provide a convenient means \nof DC biasing the secondary; however, they often show poor balance at high input frequencies, resulting in large 2nd order harmonics. \nFigure 3.

An external bypass capacitor is required for the V\nCM output. This provides a high frequency \nlow impedance path to ground for internal and external circuitry. This is also the compensation capacitor for the reference; which will not be stable without this capacitor. The minimum value required for stability is 2.2μF.Direct Coupled Circuits\nFigure 5 demonstrates the use of a differential ampliﬁ  er to \nconvert a single ended input signal into a differential input  signal. The advantage of this method is that it provides low frequency input response; however, the limited gain bandwidth of any op amp or closed-loop ampliﬁ  er will de-\ngrade the ADC SFDR at high input frequencies. Additionally, wideband op amps or differential ampliﬁ  ers tend to have \nhigh noise. As a result, the SNR will be degraded unless the noise bandwidth is limited prior to the ADC input.\nReference Operation\nFigure 6 shows the LTC2217 reference circuitry consisting \nof a 2.5V bandgap reference, a programmable gain ampli-ﬁ  er and control circuit. The LTC2217 has three modes of reference operation: Internal Reference, 1.25V external reference or 2.5V external reference. To use the internal APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC2217\n212217fThe internal programmable gain ampliﬁ  er provides the \ninternal reference voltage for the ADC. This ampliﬁ  er has \nvery stringent settling requirements and therefore is not accessible for external use.\nThe SENSE pin can be driven ±5% around the nominal 2.5V \nor 1.25V external reference inputs. This adjustment range can be used to trim the ADC gain error or other system gain errors. When selecting the internal reference, the SENSE pin should be tied to V\nDD as close to the converter \nas possible. If the sense pin is driven externally it should be bypassed to ground as close to the device as possible with 1μF ceramic capacitor.\nFigure 7.

Each input may be driven from ground to V DD for \nsingle-ended drive.\nDriving the Encode Inputs\nThe noise performance of the LTC2217 can depend on \nthe encode signal quality as much as on the analog input. The encode inputs are intended to be driven differentially, primarily for noise immunity from common mode noise sources. Each input is biased through a 6k resistor to a 1.6V bias. The bias resistors set the DC operating point for transformer coupled drive circuits and can set the logic threshold for single-ended drive circuits.\nAny noise present on the encode signal will result in ad-\nditional aperture jitter that will be RMS summed with the inherent ADC aperture jitter. \nIn applications where jitter is critical (high input frequen-\ncies), take the following into consideration:\n1. Differential drive should be used. 2. Use as large an amplitude possible. If using trans-\nformer coupling, use a higher turns ratio to increase the amplitude. Figure 8a.

The pipelined architecture of this ADC relies on storing analog signals on small valued capacitors. Junction leakage will discharge the capacitors. The speciﬁ  ed minimum operating \nfrequency for the LTC2217 is 1Msps.\nDIGITAL OUTPUTS\nDigital Output Modes\nThe LTC2217 can operate in four digital output modes: \nstandard LVDS, low power LVDS, full rate CMOS, and demultiplexed CMOS. The LVDS pin selects the mode of operation. This pin has a four level logic input, centered at 0, 1/3V\nDD, 2/3V DD and V DD. An external resistor divider can \nbe used to set the 1/3V DD and 2/3V DD logic levels. Table 1 \nshows the logic states for the LVDS pin.\nTable 1.

Each buffer is powered by OV\nDD and OGND, isolated from the \nADC power and ground. The additional N-channel transistor in the output driver allows operation down to low voltages. The internal resistor in series with the output makes the output appear as 50 Ω to external circuitry and eliminates \nthe need for external damping resistors.\nAs with all high speed/high resolution converters, the \ndigital output loading can affect the performance. The digital outputs of the LTC2217 should drive a minimum capacitive load to avoid possible interaction between the digital outputs and sensitive input circuitry. The output should be buffered with a device such as a ALVCH16373 CMOS latch. For full speed operation the capacitive load should be kept under 10pF.

ENC Drive Using a CMOS to PECL Translator\nMaximum and Minimum Encode Rates\nThe maximum encode rate for the LTC2217 is 105Msps. \nFor the ADC to operate properly the encode signal should have a 50% (±5%) duty cycle. Each half cycle must have at least 4.5ns for the ADC internal circuitry to have enough settling time for proper operation. Achieving a precise 50% duty cycle is easy with differential sinusoidal drive using a transformer or using symmetric differential logic such as PECL or LVDS. When using a single-ended ENCODE signal asymmetric rise and fall times can result in duty cycles that are far from 50%.\nAn optional clock duty cycle stabilizer can be used if the \ninput clock does not have a 50% duty cycle. This circuit uses the rising edge of ENC pin to sample the analog input. The falling edge of ENC is ignored and an internal falling edge is generated by a phase-locked loop. The input clock duty cycle can vary from 30% to 70% and the clock duty cycle stabilizer will maintain a constant 50% internal duty cycle. If the clock is turned off for a long period of time, the duty cycle stabilizer circuit will require one hundred clock cycles for the PLL to lock onto the input clock. To use the clock duty cycle stabilizer, the MODE pin must be connected to 1/3V\nDD or 2/3V DD using external resistors.Figure 9.

To minimize noise the PC board \ntraces for each LVDS output pair should be routed close together. To minimize clock skew all LVDS PC board traces should have about the same length.\nIn Low Power LVDS Mode 1.75mA is steered between \nthe differential outputs, resulting in ±175mV at the LVDS receiver’s 100 Ω termination resistor. The output com-\nmon mode voltage is 1.20V, the same as standard LVDS Mode. \nData Format \nThe LTC2217 parallel digital output can be selected for \noffset binary or 2’s complement format. The format is selected with the MODE pin. This pin has a four level logic input, centered at 0, 1/3V\nDD, 2/3V DD and V DD.

Equivalent Output Buffer in LVDS ModeAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLTC2217\n242217fOverﬂ  ow Bit\nAn overﬂ  ow output bit (OF) indicates when the converter \nis over-ranged or under-ranged. In CMOS mode, a logic high on the OFA pin indicates an overﬂ  ow or underﬂ  ow on the A data bus, while a logic high on the OFB pin indicates an overﬂ  ow on the B data bus. In LVDS mode, a differ-ential logic high on OF\n+/OF– pins indicates an overﬂ  ow \nor underﬂ  ow. \nOutput Clock\nThe ADC has a delayed version of the encode input avail-\nable as a digital output, CLKOUT. The CLKOUT pin can be used to synchronize the converter data to the digital system. This is necessary when using a sinusoidal en-code. In both CMOS modes, A bus data will be updated as CLKOUTA falls and CLKOUTB rises. In demultiplexed CMOS mode the B bus data will be updated as CLKOUTA falls and CLKOUTB rises. \nIn Full Rate CMOS Mode, only the A data bus is active; \ndata may be latched on the rising edge of CLKOUTA or the falling edge of CLKOUTB.\nIn demultiplexed CMOS mode CLKOUTA and CLKOUTB \nwill toggle at 1/2 the frequency of the encode signal. Both the A bus and the B bus may be latched on the rising edge of CLKOUTA or the falling edge of CLKOUTB. \nDigital Output Randomizer\nInterference from the ADC digital outputs is sometimes \nunavoidable. Interference from the digital outputs may be from capacitive or inductive coupling, or coupling through the ground plane. Even a tiny coupling factor can result in discernible unwanted tones in the ADC output spectrum. By randomizing the digital output before it is transmitted off chip, these unwanted tones can be randomized, trading a slight increase in the noise ﬂ  oor for a large reduction in unwanted tone amplitude.\nThe digital output is “Randomized” by applying an exclu-\nsive-OR logic operation between the LSB and all other data output bits. To decode, the reverse operation is applied; that is, an exclusive-OR operation is applied between the LSB and all other bits. The LSB, OF and CLKOUT output \nare not affected. The output Randomizer function is active when the RAND pin is high.\nOutput Driver Power\nSeparate output power and ground pins allow the output \ndrivers to be isolated from the analog circuitry. The power supply for the digital output buffers, OV\nDD, should be tied \nto the same power supply as for the logic being driven. For example, if the converter is driving a DSP powered by a 1.8V supply, then OV\nDD should be tied to that same \n1.8V supply. In CMOS mode OV DD can be powered with \nany logic voltage up to the 3.6V. OGND can be powered with any voltage from ground up to 1V and must be less than OV\nDD. The logic outputs will swing between OGND \nand OV DD. In LVDS Mode, OV DD should be connected to \na 3.3V supply and OGND should be connected to GND.Figure 13.

Small errors in the transfer function are usually a result of ADC element mismatches. An optional internal dither mode can be enabled to randomize the input location on the ADC transfer curve, resulting in improved SFDR for low signal levels.\nAs shown in Figure 15, the output of the sample-and-hold \nampliﬁ  er is summed with the output of a dither DAC. The \ndither DAC is driven by a long sequence pseudo-random number generator; the random number fed to the dither DAC is also subtracted from the ADC result. If the dither DAC is precisely calibrated to the ADC, very little of the dither signal will be seen at the output. The dither signal that does leak through will appear as white noise. The dither DAC is calibrated to result in typically less than 0.5dB elevation in the noise ﬂ  oor of the ADC as compared to the noise ﬂ  oor with dither off, when a suitable input termination is provided (see Demo Board schematic DC996B). \nFigure 15.

The pinout of the LTC2217 has been optimized for a ﬂ  owthrough layout so that the interaction between inputs and digital outputs is minimized. Layout for the printed circuit board should ensure that digital and analog signal lines are separated \nas much as possible. In particular, care should be taken not to run any digital track alongside an analog signal track or underneath the ADC. \nHigh quality ceramic bypass capacitors should be used \nat the V\nDD, VCM, and OV DD pins. Bypass capacitors must \nbe located as close to the pins as possible. The traces connecting the pins and bypass capacitors must be kept \nshort and should be made as wide as possible.\nThe LTC2217 differential inputs should run parallel and \nclose to each other. The input traces should be as short as possible to minimize capacitance and to minimize noise pickup.\nHeat Transfer\nMost of the heat generated by the LTC2217 is transferred \nfrom the die through the bottom-side exposed pad. For good electrical and thermal performance, the exposed pad must be soldered to a large grounded pad on the PC board. It is critical that the exposed pad and all ground pins are connected to a ground plane of sufﬁ  cient area with as many vias as possible.
