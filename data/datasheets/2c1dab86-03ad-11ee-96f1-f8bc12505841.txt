The AD8571/ AD8572/ AD85741 are single, dual, and \nquad amplifiers, respectively, featuring rail-to-rail input and output swings. All are guaranteed to operate from 2.7 V to 5 V \nsingle supply. \nThe AD8571 /AD8572/ AD8574 provide benefits previously \nfound only in expensive auto-zeroing or chopper-stabilized \namplifiers. Using Analog Devices, Inc., topology, these zero-\ndrift amplifiers combine low cost with high accuracy. (No external capacitors are required.) Using a spread-spectrum, auto-zero technique, the AD8571 /AD8572 /AD8574 eliminate \nthe intermodulation effects from interaction of the chopping function with the signal frequency in ac applications. \nWith an offset voltage of only 1 μV and drift of 0.005 μV/°C, the \nAD8571/ AD8572 /AD8574 are perfectly suited for applications \nwhere error sources cannot be tolerated. Position and pressure sensors, medical equipment, and strain gage amplifiers benefit \ngreatly from nearly zero drift over their operating temperature range. Many more systems require the rail-to-rail input and \noutput swings provided by the AD8571/ AD8572 /AD8574. \n \n \n1 Protected by U.S. Patent 6,130,578.

F | Page 15 of 28 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nThe AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 are CMOS amplifiers that \nachieve their high degree of precision throu gh random frequency \nauto -zero stabilization. The autocorrection topology allows the \nAD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 to maintain its low offset voltage over \na wide temperature  range, and the randomized auto -zero clock \neliminates any  inter -modulation distortion (IMD) errors at the \namplifier  output.  \nThe AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 can run from a single -supply \nvoltage as low as 2.7 V .  The extremely low offset voltage of 1 µV \nand no IMD product s allow the amplifier to be easily configured \nfor high gains without  risk of excessive output voltage errors , which  \nmakes the AD8571/ AD8572 /AD8574 an ideal amplifier for \napplications requiring both dc precision and l ow distortion for ac \nsignals. The extremely  small temperature drift of 5 nV/ °C \nensures a minimum of offset voltage error over its −40°C to \n+125°C temperature range. These combined features  make the \nAD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 an excellent choice for a variety of \nsensitive measurement and automotive applic ations.  \nAMPLIFIER ARCHITECTU RE \nEach AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 op amp consist s of two \namplifiers:  a main  ampli fier and a secondary amplifier that is used \nto correct the offset voltage  of the main amplifier. Both consist of \na rail -to-rail input stage, allowing the input common -mode \nvoltage range to reach  both supply rails. The input stage consists \nof an NMOS differential pair operating concurrently with a \nparallel PMOS differential pair. The outputs from the differential \ninput stages are combined in  another gain stage whose output is \nused to drive a rail -to-rail output stage.  \nThe wide voltage swing of the amplifier is achieved by using two \noutput transistors in a common -source configuration. The output  \nvoltage range is limited by the drain -to-source resistance of \nthese transistors. As the amplifier is requ ired to  source or sink  \nmore output current, the voltage drop across these transistors \nincreases due to their on resistance ( RDS). Simply put, the output \nvoltage does  not swing as close to the rail under heavy output \ncurrent conditions as it does  with light  output current. This is a \ncharacteristic of all rail -to-rail output amplifiers. Figure 12 and \nFigure 13 show how close the output voltage can get to the rails \nwith a given output current. Th e output of  the AD8571/ \nAD8572/ AD8574 is short -circui t protected to approximately \n50 mA of current.  \nThe AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 amplifiers have exceptional \ngain, yielding greater than 120 dB of open -loop gain with a load \nof 2 k Ω. Because the output transistors are configured in a \ncommon -source configuration,  the gain of the output stage, and \nthus the open -loop gain of the amplifier, is dependent on the \nload resistance. Open -loop gain decrease s with smaller load \nresistances, whic h is another characteristic of rail -to-rail output \namplifiers.  BASIC AUTO -ZERO AMPLIFIER THEOR Y \nAutocorrection amplifiers are not a new technology. Various IC \nimplementations have been available for more than  15 years , \nand some improvements have been made over time. The \nAD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 design offers a number of significant \nperformance improvements over older versions while attaining a \nvery substantial reduction in device cost. This section offers a simplified explanation of how the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 \nare able to offer extremely low offset voltages and high open -\nloop gains.  \nAs noted in  the Amplifier Architecture section, each \nAD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 op amp contains two internal \namplifiers. One is used as the primary amplifier, and the other as \nan autocorrection, or nulling,  amplifier. Each amplifier has an \nassociated input offset voltage that can be model ed as a dc \nvoltage source in series with the noninverting input. In Figure 50 \nand Figure 51, these are labeled  as V\nOSA and V OSB, where A \ndenotes the nulling amplifier and B denotes the primary \namplifier . The open -loop gain for the +IN and − IN inputs of \neach amplifier  is given as A X. Both amplifiers also have a third \nvoltage input with an associated open -loop gain of B X.  \nVIN+\nVIN–VOUT AB\nAAΦA1ΦB\nVOSA\n+VOSB\n+\nBB\nCM2\nCM1ΦA2VNB\nVNA–BAVOAΦB\n01104-050 \nFigure 50.

Output Phase  of the Amplifier \nThere are two modes of operation determined by the action of \ntwo sets of switches in the amplifier: an auto -zero phase and an \namplification phase.  \n \n \nAD8571/AD8572/AD8574 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 16 of 28 AUTO -ZERO PHASE  \nIn this phase, all Φ AX switches are closed , and all Φ B switches \nare open . Here, the nulling amplifier is taken out of the gain \nloop by shorting its two inputs together. Of course, there is a \ndegree of offset voltage, shown as V OSA, inh erent in the nulling \namplifie r, that maintains a potential difference between the +IN \nand −IN inputs. The nulling amplifier feedback loop is closed \nthrough ΦA2, and V OSA appears at the output of the nulling \namp lifier  and on C M1, an internal capacitor in the AD8571/ \nAD8572/ AD8574. Mathematically, this  can be express ed in the \ntime domain as  \nVOA[t] = A AVOSA[t] − B AVOA[t] (1) \nThis can also be expressed as  \n[][]\nAOSA A\nOABt VAt V\n+=\n1 (2) \nThe previous equations  show that the offset voltage of the nulling  \namplifier times a gain factor appears at the output of the nulling amplifier and thus on the C\nM1 capacitor.  \nAMPLIFICATION PHASE  \nWhen the Φ B switches  close and the Φ AX switches open for  \nthe amplification phase, the  offset voltage remains on CM1 and \nessentially corrects any error from the nulling amplifier. The voltage across C\nM1 is designated as V NA. The potential difference \nbetween the two inputs to the primary amplifier  is designated as \nVIN, or V IN = (V IN+ − VIN−). The output of the nulling amplifier \ncan then be expressed as  \nVOA[t] = A A(V IN[t] − V OSA[t]) − BAVNA[t] (3) \nBecause ΦAX is now open and there is no place for C M1 to \ndischarge, the voltage ( VNA) at the present time ( t) is equal to  \nthe voltage at the output of the nulling amp (VOA) at the time when \nΦAX is closed. If the period of the autocorrection switching  \nfrequency is designated as T S, the amplifier switches between \nphases every 0.5 ×  TS. Therefore, in the amplification phase  \n[]\uf8fa\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ee−=S NA NA T t V t V\n21 (4) \nand substituting Equation 4 and Eq uation 2 into Equation 3 yields  \n[][] []\nAS OSAA A\nOSAA IN A OABT t VBA\nt VA t VA t V\n+\uf8fa\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ee−\n− + =\n121\n(5) \n \n \n \n \n For the sake of simplification, it can be  assume d that the auto -\ncorrection frequency is much  faster than any potential change \nin V OSA or V OSB. This is a good assumption becaus e changes in \noffset voltage are a function of temperature variation or long -\nterm wear time, both of which are much slower than the  \nauto -zero clock frequency of the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574, \nwhich effectively makes the  VOS time invariant, and Equation 5 \ncan be rewritten  as \n[][]()\nAOSAAA OSA A A\nINA OABVBA VB AtVA t V\n+− ++ =\n11 (6) \nor \n[] []\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n++ =\nAOSA\nIN A OABVt VA t V\n1 (7) \nHere, the auto -zeroing becomes apparent . Note that the V OS \nterm is reduced by a factor of 1 + B A, which shows how the \nnulling amplifier has gre atly reduced its own offset voltage error \neven before correcting the primary amplifier. Th erefore , the \nprimary amplifier output voltage is the voltage at the output of the \nAD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 amplifier. It is equal to  \nVOUT[t] = A B(VIN[t] + VOSB) + B BVNB (8) \nIn the amplification phase, V OA = V NB, so this can be rewritten as  \n[]\n[] []\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n++ ++=\nAOSA\nIN A B OSBB INBOUT\nBVtVA B VAtVAt V\n1 (9) \nCombining terms  yield  \n[]\n[]()OSBB\nAOSAB A\nBA B INOUT\nVABVBABA AtVt V\n++++=\n1 (10) \nThe AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 architecture is optimized in \nsuch a way that A A = AB, BA = B B, and B A >> 1. In addition , the \ngain product to A ABB is much greater than A B. Therefore , \nEquation 10 can be simplified to  \nVOUT[t] = V IN[t]AABA + AA(VOSA+ VOSB) (11) \nMost obvious is the gain product of both the primary and nulling  \namplifiers. This A ABA term is what gives the AD8571/ AD8572/ \nAD8574 extremely  high open -loop gain. To understand how \nVOSA and V OSB relate to the overall effective input offset voltage of \nthe complete amplifier,  set up the generic amplifier equation of  \nVOUT = k × (VIN + VOS, EFF ) (12) \nwhere:  \nk is the open -loop gain of an amplifier . \nVOS, EFF  is its effective offset voltage.  \nPutting Equation 12 int o the form of Equation 11 gives  \nVOUT[t] = V IN[t]AABA + VOS, EFF AABA (13) \nData Sheet  AD8571/AD8572/AD8574 \n \nRev. F | Page 17 of 28 Therefore , \nAOSB OSA\nEFFOSBV VV+≈,  (14) \nThus, the offset voltages of both the primary and nulling ampli -\nfiers are reduced by the gain fa ctor B A, which takes a typical input \noffset voltage from several millivolts down to an effective input \noffset voltage of submicrovolts. This autocorrection scheme makes the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 amplifiers extremely precise.  \nHIGH GAIN, CMRR, AND PSRR \nCommon -mode and power supply rejection are indications of the \namount of offset voltage an amplifier has as a result of a change  in \nits input common -mode or power supply voltages. As shown in \nthe Amplification Phase  section, the autocorrection architecture \nof the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 allows it to effectively \nminimize offset voltages. The technique also corrects for offset \nerrors caused by common -mode  voltage swings and power \nsupply variations , which results in superb CMRR and PSRR \nfigures in excess of  130 dB. Because the autocorrection occurs \ncontinuously , these figures can be maintained across the \ntemperature range of the device  (−40°C to +125° C). \nMAXIMIZING PERFORMANCE  THROUGH  PROPER \nLAYOUT  \nTo achieve the maximum performance of the extremely high \ninput i mpedance and low offset voltage of the AD8571/ AD8572/  \nAD8574, care should be taken in the circuit board layout. The PCB surface must remain clean and free of moisture to avoid \nleakage currents  between adjacent traces. Surface coating of the \ncircuit board reduce s surface moisture and provide s a humidity \nbarrier, reducing  parasitic resistance on th e board. The use of \nguard rings around the amplifier inputs further reduce s leakage \ncurrent s. Figure 52 shows how the guard ring should be config-\nured, and Figure 53 show s the top view of how a surface -mount \nlayout can be arranged. The guard ring does not need to be a specific width, but it should for m a continuous loop around both \ninputs. By setting the guard ring voltage equal to the voltage at the non -inverting input, parasitic capacitance is minimized as \nwell. For further reduction of leakage currents, components can be \nmounted  to the PC B using Tef lon® standoff insulators.  \nVOUT VOUT\nVOUTVINAD8572\nVIN\nAD8572VINAD8572\n01104-052 \nFigure 52.

Top View of AD857 2 SOIC Layout with Guard Rings  \nOther potential sources of offset error are thermoelectric voltages on the circuit board. This voltage, also called Seebeck \nvoltage, occurs at the junction of two dissimilar metals and is \nproportional to the junction tempera ture. The most common \nmetallic junctions on a circuit board are solder -to-board trace \nand solder -to-component lead. Figure 54 shows a cross -section \nview of the thermal voltage error sources. When  the temperature   \nof the PC B at on e end of the component (T\nA1) differs from the \ntemperature at the other end (T A2), the Seebeck voltages are not \nequal, resulting in a thermal voltage error.  \nThis thermocouple error can be reduced by using dummy components to match the thermoelectric error s ource. Placing \nthe dummy component as close as possible to its partner ensure s \nthat both Seebeck voltages are equal, thus canceling the thermo -\ncouple  error. Maintaining a constant ambient temperature on the \ncircuit  board further reduce s this error. The use  of a ground \nplane help s distribute heat throughout the board and also \nreduc es EMI noise pickup.  \nSURFACE MOUNT\nCOMPONENTCOMPONENT\nLEAD\nSOLDER\nPC BOARD\nCOPPER\nTRACETA2\nIF T A1≠TA2, THEN\nVTS1 + VSC1≠VTS2 + VSC2TA1VSC1\nVTS1+–+–VSC2\nVTS2++–\n–\n01104-054 \nFigure 54.

F | Page 18 of 28 1/f NOISE CHARACTERISTIC S \nAnother advantage of auto -zero amplifiers is their ability to \ncancel flicker noise. Flicker noise, also known as 1/f noise, is \nnoise inherent in the physics of semiconductor devic es and \nincreases 3 dB for every octave decrease in frequency. The 1/f \ncorner frequency of an amplifier is the frequency at which the flicker noise is equal to the broadband noise of the amplifier.  \nAt lower frequencies, flicker noise dominates, causing hig her \ndegrees of error for sub -Hertz frequencies or dc precision \napplications.  \nBecause the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 amplifiers are self -\ncorrecting op amps, they do not have increasing flicker noise at \nlower frequencies. In essence, low frequency noise is treated as a \nslowly varying offset error and is gr eatly reduced with \nautocorrection. The correction becomes more effective as the \nnoise frequency approaches dc, offsetting the tendency of the \nnoise to increase exponentially as frequency decreases , which \nallows the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 to have lower noise near \ndc than standard low noise amplifiers that are susceptible to 1/f noise.  \nRANDOM AUTO -ZERO CORRECTION ELIM INATES \nINTERMODULATION DIST ORTION  \nThe AD8571/ AD8 572/ AD8574 can be used as conventional  \nop amp s for gains up to 1 MHz. The auto -zero correction \nfrequency of the device continu ously varies, based on a \npseudo random generator with a un iform distribution from \n2 kHz to 4 kHz. The randomization of the autocorrection clock \ncreates a continuous randomization of IMD products that show \nup as simple broadband noise at the output of the amplifier. This broadband noise naturall y combines with the  amplifier voltage \nnoise in a root -squared -sum fashion, resulting in an output free \nIMD.

F | Page 19 of 28 BROADBAND AND EXTERNAL R ESISTOR NOISE CONSIDERATIONS \nThe total broadband noise output from any amplifier is primarily a \nfunction of three types of noise: input voltage noise from the \namplifier, input current noise from the amplifier, and Johnson noise from the external resistors used around the amplifier. Input voltage noise, or e\nn, is strictly a function of the amplifier \nused. The Johnson noise from a resistor is a function of the \nresistance and the temperature. Input current noise, or i n, \ncreates an equivalent voltage noise proportional to the resistors \nused around the amplifier. These noise sources are not correlated with each other and their combined noise sums in a root-\nsquared-sum fashion. The full equation is given as \ne\nn, TOTAL  = [en2 + 4kTr s + (inrs)2]1/2 (15) \nwhere:  \nen is the input voltage noise of the amplifier. \nin is the input current noise of the amplifier. \nrs is the source resistance connected to the noninverting \nterminal. \nk is Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K). \nT is the ambient temperature in Kelvin (K = 273.15 + °C). \nThe input voltage noise density, e n, of the AD8571/ AD8572 / \nAD8574 is 51 nV/√Hz, and the input noise, i n, is 2 fA/√Hz. The \nen, TOTAL  is dominated by the input voltage noise provided that \nthe source resistance is less than 172 kΩ. With source resistance greater than 172 kΩ, the overall noise of the system is \ndominated by the Johnson noise of the resistor itself. \nBecause the input current noise of the AD8571/ AD8572/ \nAD8574 is very small, i\nn does not become a dominant term \nunless r s > 4 GΩ, which is an impractical value of source \nresistance. The total noise, e\nn, TOTAL , is expressed in volts-per-square-root \nHertz, and the equivalent rms noise over a certain bandwidth \ncan be found as \nen = en, TOTAL  ×BW  (16) \nwhere BW is the bandwidth of interest in Hertz. \nOUTPUT OVERDRIVE RECOVERY  \nThe AD8571 /AD8572/ AD8574 amplifiers have an excellent \noverdrive recovery of only 200 μs from either supply rail. This \ncharacteristic is particularly difficult for autocorrection amplifiers because the nulling amplifier requires a substantial amount of time to error correct the main amplifier back to a valid output. Figure 29 and Figure 30 show the positive and \nnegative overdrive recovery times for the AD8571 /AD8572 / \nAD8574. The output overdrive recovery for an autocorrection amplifier is defined as the time it takes for the output to correct to its final \nvoltage from an overload state. It is measured by placing the amplifier in a high gain configuration with an input signal that forces the output voltage to the supply rail. The input voltage is then stepped down to the linear region of the amplifier, usually \nto halfway between the supplies. The time from the input signal \nstep-down to the output settling to within 100 μV of its final value is the overdrive recovery time. Many autocorrection amplifiers require a number of auto-zero clock cycles to recover from output overdrive, and some can take several milliseconds for the output to settle properly. \nINPUT OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION \nAlthough the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574 are rail-to-rail input \namplifiers, care should be taken to ensure that the potential difference between the inputs does not exceed 5 V . Under normal operating conditions, the amplifier corrects its output to ensure that the two inputs are at the same voltage. However, if the device is configured as a comparator, or is under some unusual operating condition, the input voltages may be forced to different \npotentials, which could cause excessive current to flow through the \ninternal diodes in the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574  used to protect \nthe input stage against overvoltage. \nIf either input exceeds either supply rail by more than 0.3 V , \nlarge amounts of current begin to flow through the ESD \nprotection diodes in the amplifier. These diodes are connected between the inputs and each supply rail to protect the input transistors against an electrostatic discharge event and are \nnormally reverse-biased. However, if the input voltage exceeds \nthe supply voltage, these ESD diodes become forward-biased. Without current-limiting, excessive amounts of current can flow through these diodes, causing permanent damage to the device. If inputs are subject to overvoltage, appropriate series resistors should be inserted to limit the diode current to less than 2 mA. \nOUTPUT PHASE REVERSAL \nOutput phase reversal occurs in some amplifiers when the input \ncommon-mode voltage range is exceeded. As common-mode \nvoltage moves outside the common-mode range, the outputs of these amplifiers suddenly jump in the opposite direction to  the supply rail. This is the result of the differential input pair shutting down, causing a radical shifting of internal voltages that results in the erratic output behavior. \nThe AD8571 /AD8572/ AD8574 amplifiers have been carefully \ndesigned to prevent any output phase reversal, provided that \nboth inputs are maintained within the supply voltages. If one or \nboth inputs exceed either supply voltage, a resistor should be \nplaced in series with the input to limit the current to less than \n2 mA to ensure that the output does not reverse its phase. \nAD8571/AD8572/AD8574 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Its rail -to-\nrail input allows the amplifier to be used as either a high- side  \nor a low -side current monitor. Using both amplifiers in the \nAD8572 provides a simple method to monitor both current \nsupply and return paths for load or fault detection.  \nFigure 67 shows a high- side current monitor configuration. \nHere, the input common -mode voltage of the amplifier is at or \nnear the positive supply voltage. The rail -to-rail input  of the \namplifier provides a precise measurement, even with the input \ncommon -mode voltage at the supply voltage. The CMOS input \nstructure does not draw any input bias current, ensuring a minimum of measurement error.  \nThe 0.1 Ω resistor creates a voltage drop to the noninverting \ninput of the AD8571/ AD8572/ AD8574.
