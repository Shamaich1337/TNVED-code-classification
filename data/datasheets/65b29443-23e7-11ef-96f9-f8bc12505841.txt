It combines the\nfunctionality of the PCA82C250, PCA82C251 and TJA1040 transceivers with improved\nEMC and ESD handling capability and quiescent current performance. Improved slope\ncontrol and high DC handling capability on the bus pins provide additional application\nflexibility.\nThe TJA1042 is available in two versions, distinguished only by the function of pin 5:\n•The TJA1042T and TJA1042CT are backwards compatible with the TJA1040 when\nused with a 5 V microcontroller, and also cover existing PCA82C250 and PCA82C251\napplications\n•The TJA1042T(K)/3 and TJA1042BT(K) allow for direct interfacing to microcontrollers\nwith supply voltages down to 3 V\n7.1 Operating modes\nThe TJA1042 supports two operating modes, Normal and Standby, which are selected\nvia pin STB. See Table 4  for a description of the operating modes under normal supply\nconditions.\nPin RXD Mode Pin STB\nLOW HIGH\nNormal LOW bus dominant bus recessive\nStandby HIGH wake-up request\ndetectedno wake-up request\ndetectedTable 4.\u2007Operating modes\n7.1.1 Normal mode\nA LOW level on pin STB selects Normal mode. In this mode, the transceiver can transmit\nand receive data via the bus lines CANH and CANL (see Figure 1  for the block diagram).\nThe differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data which\nis output to pin RXD. The slopes of the output signals on the bus lines are controlled\ninternally and are optimized in a way that guarantees the lowest possible EME.\n7.1.2 Standby mode\nA HIGH level on pin STB selects Standby mode. In Standby mode, the transceiver is not\nable to transmit or correctly receive data via the bus lines. The transmitter and Normal-\nmode receiver blocks are switched off to reduce supply current, and only a low-power\ndifferential receiver monitors the bus lines for activity. The wake-up filter on the output\nof the low-power receiver does not latch bus dominant states, but ensures that only bus\ndominant and bus recessive states that persist longer than t fltr(wake)bus  are reflected on pin\nRXD.\nIn Standby mode, the bus lines are biased to ground to minimize the system supply\ncurrent. The low-power receiver is supplied by V IO, and is capable of detecting CAN\nbus activity even if V IO is the only supply voltage available. When pin RXD goes LOW to\nsignal a wake-up request, a transition to Normal mode will not be triggered until STB is\nforced LOW.\nTJA1042 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

If the LOW state on\npin TXD persists for longer than t to(dom)TXD , the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus\nlines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application\nfailure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network\ncommunications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD is set to\nHIGH. The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of\n40 kbit/s.\n7.2.2 Bus dominant time-out function\nIn Standby mode a \'bus dominant time-out\' timer is started when the CAN bus changes\nfrom recessive to dominant state. If the dominant state on the bus persists for longer\nthan t to(dom)bus , the RXD pin is reset to HIGH. This function prevents a clamped dominant\nbus (due to a bus short-circuit or a failure in one of the other nodes on the network) from\ngenerating a permanent wake-up request. The bus dominant time-out timer is reset when\nthe CAN bus changes from dominant to recessive state.\n7.2.3 Internal biasing of TXD and STB input pins\nPins TXD and STB have internal pull-ups to V IO to ensure a safe, defined state in case\none or both of these pins are left floating. Pull-up currents flow in these pins in all states;\nboth pins should be held HIGH in Standby mode to minimize standby current.\n7.2.4 Undervoltage detection on pins V CC and V IO\nShould V CC drop below the V CC undervoltage detection level, V uvd(VCC) , the transceiver\nwill switch to Standby mode. The logic state of pin STB will be ignored until V CC has\nrecovered.\nShould V IO drop below the V IO undervoltage detection level, V uvd(VIO) , the transceiver will\nswitch off and disengage from the bus (zero load) until V IO has recovered.\nTJA1042 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

If the virtual\njunction temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, T j(sd), the output\ndrivers will be disabled until the virtual junction temperature falls below T j(sd) and TXD\nbecomes recessive again. Including the TXD condition ensures that output driver\noscillation due to temperature drift is avoided.\n7.3 SPLIT output pin and V IO supply pin\nTwo versions of the TJA1042 are available, only differing in the function of a single pin.\nPin 5 is either a SPLIT output pin or a V IO supply pin.\n7.3.1 SPLIT pin\nUsing the SPLIT pin on the TJA1042T and TJA1042CT in conjunction with a split\ntermination network (see Figure 4  and Figure 7 ) can help to stabilize the recessive\nvoltage level on the bus. This will reduce EME in networks with DC leakage to ground\n(e.g. from deactivated nodes with poor bus leakage performance). In Normal mode, pin\nSPLIT delivers a DC output voltage of 0.5V CC. In Standby mode or when V CC is off, pin\nSPLIT is floating. When not used, the SPLIT pin should be left open.\nTJA1042TVCC\nCANLSPLITCANH\n60 Ω\n60 ΩR\nR\nGNDVSPLIT = 0.5 VCC \nin normal mode; \notherwise floating\n015aaa020\nFigure 4.\u2007Stabilization circuitry and application for version with SPLIT pin\n7.3.2 VIO supply pin\nPin V IO on the TJA1042T(K)/3 and TJA1042BT(K) variants should be connected to the\nmicrocontroller supply voltage (see Figure 8 ). This will adjust the signal levels of pins\nTXD, RXD and STB to the I/O levels of the microcontroller. Pin V IO also provides the\ninternal supply voltage for the low-power differential receiver of the transceiver. For\napplications running in low-power mode, this allows the bus lines to be monitored for\nactivity even if there is no supply voltage on pin V CC.\nFor versions of the TJA1042 without a V IO pin, the V IO input is internally connected to\nVCC. This sets the signal levels of pins TXD, RXD and STB to levels compatible with 5 V\nmicrocontrollers.\nTJA1042 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as\ndescribed in JESD625-A  or equivalent standards.\n16Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account\nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow\nsoldering description” .\n16.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached\nto Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides\nboth the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method\nthat is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole\nand Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is\nnot suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high\ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n16.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming\nfrom a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the\nfollowing:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless\npackages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,\nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,\ndue to an increased probability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by\ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,\npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n16.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\nTJA1042 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

It is imperative that the peak\ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder\npaste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the\npackages and/or boards are not damaged.
