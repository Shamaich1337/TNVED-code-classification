The LSF family can also be used in applications where a push-pull driver is connected to the data \nI/Os.

This allows bidirectional voltage translation between 0.95 V and 5.5 V without \nthe need for a direction pin in open-drain or push-pull applications. The LSF family supports level translation \napplications with transmission speeds greater than 100 Mbps for open-drain systems using a 30-pF capacitance \nand 250- Ω pullup resistor. Both the output driver of the controller and the peripheral device output can be \npush-pull or open-drain (pull-up resistors may be required). In both up and down translation, the B-side is often \nreferred to as the high side and refers to devices connected to the B ports. The A-side can be referred to as the \nlow side.LSF0108\nSDLS966M – DECEMBER 2013 – REVISED APRIL 2023\n www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LSF0108\n8.3.2 Output Enable\nTo enable the I/O pins, the EN input should be tied directly to V ref_B during operation and both pins must be \npulled up to the HIGH side (V CCB) through a bias resistor (typically 200 k Ω). To ensure the high impedance state \nduring power-up, power-down, or during operation, the EN pin must be LOW. The EN pin should always be tied \ndirectly to the V ref_B pin and is recommended to be disabled by an open-drain driver without a pullup resistor. \nThis allows V ref_B to regulate the EN input and bias the channels for proper translation. A filter capacitor on V ref_B \nis recommended for a stable supply at the device.\n1.8 V\nVref_AVCCB\nEN200 kΩ  \nVref_B3.3 V\nA1 B10.1 μF\nFigure 8-1.

The low R ON of the switch allows \nconnections to be made with minimal propagation delay and signal distortion.\nTable 8-1  provides a summary of device operation. For additional details on the functional operation of the LSF \nfamily of devices, see the Down Translation with the LSF Family  and Up Translation with the LSF Family  videos.\nTable 8-2.

This functionality allows seamless translation between higher and lower voltages selected by the \nuser, without the need for directional control. Pull-up resistors are always required on the high side, and pull-ups \nare only required on the low side, if the low side of the device\'s output is open drain or its input has a leakage \ngreater than 1 µA.\n1.8 V\nVref_AVCCB\nEN200 k\x01  \nA1\nA2B1\nB2\nGNDLSF010x\nVref_BVCCA\n1.8 V\nDevice3.3 V\nRB1\n3.3 V\nDevice0.1  μF\nFigure 8-2. Up Translation Example Schematic with Push-Pull and Open Drain Configuration\nUp translation with the LSF requires attention to two important factors: maximum data rate and sink current. \nMaximum data rate is directly related to the rising edge of the output signal. Sink current depends on supply \nvalues and the chosen pull-up resistor values.

A pull-up resistor can be added on either side of the device. There are \nspecial circumstances that allow the removal of one or both of the pull-up resistors. If the signal is always going \nto be down translated from a push-pull transmitter, then the resistor on the B-side can be removed. If the leakage \ncurrent into the receiver on the A-side is less than 1 µA, then the resistor on the A-side can also be removed. \nThis arrangement with no external pull-up resistors can be used when down translating from a push-pull output \nto a low-leakage input. For an open drain transmitter, the pull-up resistor on the B-side is necessary because an \nopen drain output can\'t drive high by itself. Refer to Table 8-2  for a summary of device operation.

The A1 and A2 channels have a maximum output voltage equal to V ref_A and the B1 and B2 channels have \nhas a maximum output voltage equal to V PU.\nThe LSF family has an EN input that is used to disable the device by setting EN LOW, placing all I/Os \nin the high-impedance state. Since the LSF family of devices are switch-type voltage translators, the power \nconsumption is very low. TI recommends always enabling the LSF family for bidirectional applications (I2C, \nSMBus, PMBus, or MDIO).\nTable 9-2.

The 200 k Ω bias \nresistor is required to allow V ref_B to regulate the EN input and properly bias the device for translation. A 0.1 µF \ncapacitor is recommended for providing a path from V ref_B to ground for high frequency noise. V ref_B and V I(EN) \nare recommended to be 1.0 V higher than V ref_A for best signal integrity.\nAttempting to drive the EN pin directly with a push-pull output device is a very common design error with the \nLSF01 series of devices. It is also very important to note that current does flow into the A-side voltage supply \nduring normal operation. Not all voltage sources can sink current, so be sure that applicable designs can handle \nthis current. For more design details, see the Understanding the Bias Circuit for the LSF Family  video.\n1.8 V\nVref_AVCCB\nEN200 kΩ    \nVref_B3.3 V\nA1 B10.1 µF\nFigure 9-2.

This allows V ref_B to regulate the EN input and bias the channels for proper \ntranslation. A filter capacitor on V ref_B is recommended for a stable supply at the device. The controller output \ndriver can be push-pull or open-drain (pull-up resistors may be required) and the peripheral device output can be \npush-pull or open-drain (pull-up resistors are required to pull the Bn outputs to V PU).\nNote\nIf either output is push-pull, data must be unidirectional or the outputs must be tri-state and be \ncontrolled by some direction-control mechanism to prevent HIGH-to-LOW bus contention in either \ndirection. If both outputs are open-drain, no direction control is needed.\n9.2.1.2.2 Pull-Up Resistor Sizing\nThe pull-up resistor value needs to limit the current through the pass transistor when it is in the ON state to \nabout 15 mA. This ensures a voltage drop of 260 mV to 350 mV to have a valid LOW signal on the downstream \nchannel. If the current through the pass transistor is higher than 15 mA, the voltage drop is also higher in the \nON state. To set the current through each pass transistor at 15 mA, calculate the pull-up resistor value using the \nfollowing equation:\nRp u \xa0 = \xa0Vpu\xa0 − \xa00.35 \xa0V\n0.015 \xa0 A\xa0 (3)\nTable 9-3  summarizes resistor values, reference voltages, and currents at 8 mA, 5 mA, and 3 mA. The resistor \nvalue shown in the +10% column (or a larger value) should be used to ensure that the voltage drop across the \ntransistor is 350 mV or less. The external driver must be able to sink the total current from the resistors on both \nsides of the LSF family device at 0.175 V, although the 15 mA applies only to current flowing through the LSF \nfamily device. The device driving the low state at 0.175 V must sink current from one or more of the pull-up \nresistors and maintain V OL. A decrease in resistance will increase current, and thus result in increased V OL.\nTable 9-3.

Open Drain Translation (1.8 V to 3.3 V at 2.5 MHz)\n9.2.2 Mixed-Mode Voltage Translation\nThe supply voltage (V PU) for each channel can be individually set with a pull-up resistor. Figure 9-4  shows an \nexample of this mixed-mode multi-voltage translation. For additional details on multi-voltage translation, see the \nMulti-voltage Translation with the LSF Family  video.\nWith the V ref_B pulled up to 5 V and V ref_A connected to 1.8 V, all channels will be clamped to 1.8 V at which \npoint a pullup can be used to define the high level voltage for a given channel.\n•Push-Pull Down Translation (5 V to 1.8 V):  Channel 1 is an example of this setup. When B1 is 5 V, A1 is \nclamped to 1.8 V, and when B1 is LOW, A1 is driven LOW through the switch.\n•Push-Pull Up Translation (1.8 V to 5 V) : Channel 2 is an example of this setup. When A2 is 1.8 V, the \nswitch is high impedance and the B2 channel is pulled up to 5 V. When A2 is LOW, B2 is driven LOW through \nthe switch.\n•Push-Pull Down Translation (3.3 V to 1.8 V):  Channels 3 and 4 are examples of this setup. When either B3 \nor B4 are driven to 3.3 V, A3 or A4 are clamped to 1.8 V, and when either B3 or B4 are LOW, A3 or A4 are \ndriven LOW through the switch.\n•Open-Drain Bidirectional Translation (3.3 V ↔ 1.8 V):  Channels 5 through 8 are examples of this setup. \nThese channels are for bidirectional operation for I2C and MDIO to translate between 1.8 V and 3.3 V with \nopen-drain drivers.LSF0108\nSDLS966M – DECEMBER 2013 – REVISED APRIL 2023\n www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LSF0108\nVref_A Vref_B\nEN\nA1\nA2B1\nB2LSF010x200 k \x01\nVcc VccRpu\nGPIO\nGPIOGPIO\nGPIOVref(A) = 1.8 V    Vpu    =    5.0 V\nRpu RpuVpu    =    3.3 V\nGPIO\nGPIO1.8 V\nA3\nA4B3\nB4\nA5\nA6B5\nB6SCL\nSDAGPIO\nGPIO\nMDIO\nMDCSCL\nSDA\nMDIO\nMDCRpu RpuSW\nSW\nSW\nSWSW\nSW\nSWSWVccFigure 9-4.

In the following figure, a single 3.3 V supply is used to translate between a 3.3 V device and a device \nthat can change between 1.8 V and 5.0 V. R1 and R2 are added in place of the second supply.

The typical operating mode of the \ndevice ensures that when down translating from B to A, the A-side I/O ports will clamp at V ref_A to provide proper \nvoltage translation. For further explanation of device operation, see the Down Translation with the LSF Family \nvideo.\nRequirements for V ref_B < V ref_A + 0.8 V Operation:  in this scenario, there is not a large enough voltage \ndifference between V ref_A and V ref_B to ensure that the A side I/O ports will be clamped at V ref_A, but rather at a \nvoltage approximately equal to V ref_B – 0.8 V. For example, if V ref_B = 1.8 V and V ref_A = 1.2 V, the A-side I/Os \nwill clamp to a voltage around 1.0 V. Therefore, to operate in such a condition, the following additional design \nconsiderations must be met:\n•Vref_B must be greater than V Ref_A during operation (V ref_B > V ref_A)\n•Pullup resistors should be populated on A-side I/O ports to ensure the line will be fully pulled up to the \ndesired voltage.\nFigure 9-6  shows an example of this setup, where 1.2 V ↔ 1.8 V translation is achieved with the LSF0108 .
