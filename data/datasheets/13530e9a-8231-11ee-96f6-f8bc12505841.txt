Application Circuits\nLITELINK can be used with telephone networks \nworldwide. Some public telephone networks, notably in North America and Japan require a resistive line termination. Other telephone networks, such as in Europe, China and elsewhere, require a reactive line termination.The application circuits that  follow address both types \nof line termination models.  A reactive termination \napplication circuit that describes the TBR-21 implementation is shown in Figure 3 on page 8.

Using LITELINK\nAs a full-featured telephone line interface, LITELINK \nperforms the following functions:\n•DC termination and V/I slope control\n•AC impedance control\n•2-wire to 4-wire conversion (hybrid)\n•Current limiting\n•Ringing detect signalling reception\n•Caller ID signalling reception\n•Switch hook\nLITELINK can accommodate specific application \nfeatures without sacrific ing basic func tionality or \nperformance. Application features include, but are not limited to:\n•High transmit power operation\n•Pulse dialing\n•Ground start\n•Loop start\n•Parallel telephone off-hook detection (line intrusion)\n•Battery reversal detection\n•Line presence detection\n•World-wide programmable operation\nThis section of the data sheet describes LITELINK \noperation in standard configuration for usual operation. IXYS Integrated Circuits Division offers \nadditional application information on-line (see Section 5 \non page 14)  for the following topics:\n•Circuit isolation considerations\n•Optimizing LITELINK performance\n•Data Access Arrangement architecture\n•LITELINK circuit descriptions\n•Surge protection\n•EMI considerations\nOther specific application materials are also referenced in this section as appropriate.\n3.1 Switch Hook Control (On-hook \nand Off-hook States)\nLITELINK operates in one of two conditions, on-hook \nand off-hook. In the on-hook condition the telephone line is available for calls. In the off-hook condition the telephone line is engaged. The OH\n control input is \nused to place LITELINK in one of these two states. \nWith OH  high, LITELINK is on-hook and ready to \nmake or receive a call. Also while on-hook, LITELINK’s ringing detector and CID amplifiers are \nboth active. \nAsserting OH  low causes LITELINK to answer or \noriginate a call by entering the off-hook state. In the \noff-hook state, loop current flows through LITELINK.\n3.2 On-hook Operation: OH =1\nThe LITELINK application circuit leakage current is less than 10 \uf06dA with 100 V across ring and tip, \nequivalent to greater than 10 M \uf057 on-hook resistance.\n3.2.1 Ringing Signal Reception via the \nSnoop Circuit\nIn the on-hook state (OH  not asserted), an internal \nmultiplexer engages the snoop circuitry. This circuit simultaneously monitors the telephone line for two conditions; incoming ringing signal and caller ID data bursts.\nRefer to the application schematic diagram (see Figure \n2 on page 6) . C7 (C\nSNP-) and C8 (CSNP+) provide a \nhigh-voltage isolation barrier between the telephone \nline and SNP- and SNP+ input pins of the LITELINK while coupling AC signals to the snoop amplifier. The snoop circuit “snoops” the telephone line continuously while drawing no dc current. In the LITELINK, the incoming ringing signals are compared to a reference level. When the ringing signal exceeds the preset threshold, the internal comparators generate the RING\n and RING2  signals which are output from \nLITELINK at pins 9 and 10, respectively. Selection of which output to use is dependent upon the support logic responsible for monitoring and filtering the ringing detect signals. To reduce or eliminate false ringing detects this signal should be digitally filtered and qualified by the system as a valid ringing signal. A logic low output on RING\n or RING2  indicates that the \nLITELINK ringing signal detect threshold has been exceeded. In the absence of any incoming ac signal the RING\n and RING2  outputs are held high.\nThe CPC5622 RING  output signal is generated by a \nhalf-wave ringing detector while the RING2  output is \ngenerated by a full-wave ringing detector. A half-wave ringing detector’s output frequency follows the frequency of the incoming ringing signal from the Central Office (CO) while a full-wave ringing detector’s output frequency is twice that of the incoming signal. Because RING\n is the output of a half-wave detector, it \nINTEGRATED  CIRCUITS  DIVISION CPC5622\nR03.1 www.ixysic.com 11will output one logic low pulse per cycle of the ringing \nfrequency. Also, because the RING2  is the output of a \nfull-wave detector it will output two logic low pulses \nper cycle of the ringing frequency. Hence, the \nnomenclature RING2  for twice the output pulses.\nThe set-up of the ringing detector comparator causes the RING\n output pulses to remain low for most of one \nhalf-cycle of the ringing signal and remains high for the entire second half-cycle of the ringing signal. For the RING2\n output, the pulses remain low during most of \nboth halves of the ringing cycle and returns high for only a short period near the zero-crossing of the ringing signal. Both of the ringing outputs remain high during the silent interval between ringing bursts. Hysteresis is employed in the LITELINK ringing detector circuit to improve noise immunity. \nThe ringing detection threshold depends on the values \nof R3 (R\nSNPD ), R6 & R44 (RSNP-), R7 & R45 (RSNP+ ), \nC7 (CSNP-), and C8 (CSNP+). The value of these \ncomponents shown in the application circuits are recommended for typical operation. The ringing detection threshold can be changed according to the following formula:\nWhere:\n•R\nSNPD  = R3 in the application circuits shown in this \ndata sheet.\n•RSNPTOTAL  = the total of R6, R7, R44, and R45 in \nthe application circuits shown in this data sheet.\n•CSNP = C7 = C8 in the application circuits shown in \nthis data sheet.\n•And ƒRING is the frequency of the ringing signal.\nIXYS Integrated Circuits Division Application Note \nAN-117 Customize Caller ID Gain and Ring Detect Voltage \nThreshold  is a spreadsheet for trying different \ncomponent values in this circuit. Changing the ringing detection threshold will also change the caller ID gain and the timing of the polarit y reversal detection pulse, \nif used.3.2.2 Polarity Reversal Detection in On-hook \nState\nThe full-wave ringing detector in the CPC5622 makes it possible to detect an on-hook tip and ring battery polarity reversal using the RING2\n output. When the \npolarity of the battery voltage applied to tip and ring reverses, a pulse on RING2\n indicates the event. The \nsystem logic must be able to discriminate a single pulse of approximately 1 msec when using the recommended external snoop circuit components from a valid ringing signal.\n3.2.3 On-hook Caller ID Signal Reception\nOn-hook Caller IDentity (CID) data burst signals are coupled through the snoop components, buffered through LITELINK and output at the RX+ and RX- pins.\nIn North America, CID data signals are typically sent \nbetween the first and second ringing signal while in \nother countries the CID information may arrive prior to any other signalling state.\nIn applications that transmit CID after the first ringing \nburst such as in North American, follow these steps to receive on-hook caller ID data via the LITELINK RX outputs:\n1. Detect the first full ringing signal burst on RING\n \nor RING2 .\n2. Monitor and process the CID data from the RX \noutputs.\nFor applications as in China and Brazil where CID may \narrive prior to ringing, follow these steps to receive on-hook caller ID data via the LITELINK RX outputs:\n1. Simultaneously monitor for CID data from the RX \noutputs and for ringing on RING\n or RING2 .\n2. Process the appropriate signalling data.\nNote: Taking LITELINK off-hook (via the OH  pin) \ndisconnects the snoop path from the receive outputs \nand disables the ringing detector outputs RING  and \nRING2 .\nCID gain from tip and ring to RX+ and RX- is determined by:VRINGPK750mV\nRSNPD-----------------\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0e6\uf0f6RSNPTOTALRSNPD+ \uf028\uf0292 1\n\uf070fRINGCSNP\uf028\uf0292--------------------------------------+ =\nINTEGRATED  CIRCUITS  DIVISION CPC5622\n12 www.ixysic.com R03.1Where:\n•RSNPD  = R3 in the application circuits in this data \nsheet.\n•RSNPTOTAL  = the total of R6, R7, R44, and R45 in \nthe application circuits in this data sheet.\n•CSNP = C7 = C8 in the application circuits in this data \nsheet.\n•and ƒ is the frequency of the CID signal\nThe recommended components in the application \ncircuits yield a gain 0. 26 dB at 2000 Hz. IXYS \nIntegrated Circuits Division Application Note AN-117 Customize Caller ID Gain and Ring Detect Voltage Threshold  \nis a spreadsheet for trying different component values in this circuit. Changing the CID gain will also change the ringing detection threshold and the timing of the polarity reversal det ection pulse, if used.\nFor single-ended receive applications where only one RX output is used, the snoop circuit gain can be \nadjusted back to 0 dB by changing the value of the snoop series resistors R6, R7, R44 and R45 from 1.8M\uf057  to 715k\uf057\uf02e This change results in negligible \nmodification to the ringing detect threshold.\n3.3 Off-Hook Operation: OH =0\n3.3.1 Receive Signal Path\nSignals to and from the telephone network appear on the tip and ring connections of the application circuit. Receive signals are extracted from transmit signals by the LITELINK two-wire to four-wire hybrid then converted to infrared light by the receive path LED. The intensity of the light is modulated by the receive signal and coupled across the electrical isolation barrier by a reflective dome.\nOn the low voltage side of the barrier, the receive \nsignal is converted by a photodiode into photocurrent. The photocurrent, a linear representation of the receive signal, is amplified and converted to a differential voltage output on RX+ and RX-.\nVariations in gain are controlled to within ±0.4 dB by \nfactory gain trim, which sets the output to unity gain.To accommodate single-suppl y operation, LITELINK \nincludes a small DC bias on the RX+ and RX- outputs of 1.0 Vdc. Most applications should AC couple the receive outputs as shown in Figure 4.\nLITELINK may be used for differential or single-ended \noutput as shown in Figure 4. Single-ended use will produce 6 dB less signal output amplitude. Do not exceed 0 dBm referenced to 600 \uf057 (2.2 V\nP-P) signal \noutput level with the standard application circuits. See application note AN-157, Increased LITELINK III Transmit Power  for more information.\nFigure 4. Differential and Single-ended Receive \nPath Connections to LITELINK\n3.3.2 Transmit Signal Path\nTransmit signals from the CODEC to the TX+ and TX- pins of LITELINK should be coupled through capacitors as shown in Figure 5 to minimize dc offset errors. Differential transmit signals are converted to single-ended signals within LI TELINK then coupled to \nthe optical transmit amplifier in a manner similar to the receive path. \nThe output of the optical amplifier is coupled to a \nvoltage-to-current converter via a transconductance stage where the transmit signal modulates the telephone line loop current. As in the receive path, the transmit gain is calibrated at the factory, limiting insertion loss to 0 ±0.4 dB.\nDifferential and single-ended transmit signals into \nLITELINK should not exceed a signal level of 0 dBm referenced to 600 \uf057 (or 2.2 V\nP-P). For output power \nlevels above 0dBm consult the application note AN-157, Increased LITELINK III Transmit Power  for more \ninformation.GAINCIDdB\uf028\uf029 206RSNPD\nRSNPTOTALRSNPD+ \uf028\uf0292 1\n\uf070fCSNP\uf028\uf0292------------------------- - +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ - log =\nRX+\nRX-\nRX+RX+\nRXRX-0.1μF\n0.1μF0.1μFLITELINK Low-Voltage Side CODEC\nor Voice Circuit\nINTEGRATED  CIRCUITS  DIVISION CPC5622\nR03.1 www.ixysic.com 13Figure 5.

This would be normal operation in most applications. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in transmission gain errors and possibly distortion.\n3.5 DC Characteristics\nThe CPC5622 is designed for worldwide applications. Modification of the values of the components at the ZDC, DCS1, and DCS2 pins allow for control of the VI slope characteristics of LITELINK. Selecting appropriate resistor values for R\nZDC (R16) and \nRDCS2 (R15) in the provided application circuits \nenable compliance with various DC requirements.\n3.5.1 Setting a Current Limit\nLITELINK includes a telephone line current limit feature that is selectable by choosing the desired value for R\nZDC (R16) using the following formula:\nIXYS Integrated Circuits Division recommends using 8.2 \uf057 for R\nZDC for most applications, limiting \ntelephone line current to 130 mA.Whether using the recommended value above or when setting R\nZDC higher for a lower loop current limit \nrefer to the guidelines for FET thermal management provided in AN-146, Guidelines for Effective \nLITELINK Designs .\n3.6 AC Characteristics\n3.6.1 Resistive Termination Applications\nNorth American and Japanese telephone line AC termination requirements are met with a resistive 600\uf057  ac 2-wire termination. For these applications \nLITELINK’s 2-wire network termination impedance is set by the resistor R\nZNT (R10) located at the ZNT pin, \npin 29, with a value of 301 \uf057.\n3.6.2 Reactive Termination Applications\nMany countries use a single-pole complex impedance to model the telephone network transmission line characteristic impedance as shown in the table below.\nProper gain and termination impedance circuits for a \ncomplex impedance requires the use of complex network on ZNT as shown in the “Reactive Termination \nApplication Circuit” on page 8 .\n3.6.3 Mode  Pin Usage\nAsserting the MODE  pin low (MODE  = 0) introduces a \n7 dB pad into the transmit path and adds 7 dB of gain to the receive path. These changes compensate for the gain changes made to the transmit and receive paths necessary for reactive termination implementations. Overall insertion loss with the reactive termination application circuit and MODE\n \nasserted is 0 dB.\nOverall insertion loss with MODE  de-asserted \n(MODE = 1) for the resistive termination application \ncircuit is 0 dB.

Regulatory Information\nLITELINK III can be used to build products that comply \nwith the requirements of TIA/EIA/IS-968 (formerly FCC part 68), FCC part 15B, TBR-21, EN60950, UL1950, EN55022B, IEC950/IEC60950, CISPR22B, EN55024, and many other standards. LITELINK provides supplementary isolation. Metallic surge requirements are met through the inclusion of a crow bar protection device in the application circuit. Longitudinal surge protection is provided by LITELINK’s optical-across-the-barrier technology and the use of high-voltage components in the application circuit as needed.The information provided in this document is intended to inform the equipment designer but it is not sufficient to assure proper system design or regulatory compliance. Since it is the equipment manufacturer's responsibility to have their equipment properly designed to conform to all relevant regulations, designers using LITELINK are advised to carefully verify that their end-product design complies with all applicable safety, EMC, and other relevant standards and regulations. Semiconductor components are not rated to withstand electrical overstress or electrostatic discharges resulting from inadequate protection measures at the board or system level.\n5.
