The firstbit of the Configuration Register (CR9) enables built-in-selftest when set to a logic ‘1’. For normal sensing operation,CR9 should be zero. The next eight Configuration Registerbits (CR8-1) set the sensing mode for each sensor. If set toa high, the sensor is GND/Open, and if programmed to alow, the sensor is Supply/Open. Data is shifted into theConfiguration Register from the serial interface with bit CR9first.HI-8429\nOVERVIEW\nThe HI-8429 is comprised of 8 sensors, which may beindividually configured for GND/Open or Supply/Open (alsoknown as 28V/Open) sensing. Eight bits of the on-chipConfiguration Register are used to set the sensorconfiguration. A high in the Configuration Register selectsGND/Open and a low selects Supply/Open mode. A ninth bitin the Configuration Register is used to enable the chip’sBuilt-In-Test (BIT) feature. The logical output from eachsensor is latched into an eight-bit Data Register on thefalling edge of the input.\nFour internal 6 bit DACs provide the High and Low\nthresholds. Reading and writing to the registers isaccomplished using a serial interface compatible with theindustry-standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus.\nFigure 1 shows a simplified block diagram of the HI-8429.CS\nAn open drain interrupt pin ( ) generates a 1 s low pulse\nwhen any of the sensor outputs change state. This frees up\nthe micro-contoller from polling the register at frequentintervals.\nSwitches SW1 and SW2 (see Figure 1)\nare open.\nThe POR also\nresets all the registers to the all zeros default state.\npin can also be used to reset the device. A\nlow on this pin has the same effect as POR detailed above.During normal operation the pin should be left open orheld high, if left open an internal 10k pulls the input up to\nVLOGIC.INT\nMR\nMR/c109\n/c87RESET AND INITIALIZATION\nThe HI-8429 includes an on-chip Power-On Reset (POR)\ncircuit, which forces the SENSE inputs to a high-impedancestate at power-up.\nThe inputs remain high-impedance until the\nConfiguration Register is programmed, defining theGND/Open (SW1 closed / SW2 open), or Supply/Open(SW1 open / SW2 closed) for each sensor.\nThe HI-8429 registers are designed to retain programmed\nlogic states through VLOGIC power dips down to 1.5Vensuring reliable operation in noisy environments withoutthe need to re-initialize the part.\nAn external7654321\nFirst Bit shifted in from SICR3CR2 CR4CR5\n8CR6CR7CR8 BIT ENABLE CR1\n9\nLast Bit shifted in from SICONFIGURATION REGISTER\nThe eight-bit Data Register captures the output state from\nthe eight discrete sensors. Data is latched on the fallingedge of . The Data bits are read out from the chip overthe serial interface. Sensor 8 data bit is output first at SOfollowed by the remaining seven sensor states. In eithermode (GND/Open or Supply/Open), a logic one is outputwhen the voltage at the sensor pin input is greater than thehigh threshold and a logic zero is output when the sensorvoltage is lower than the low threshold.\nMultiple HI-8429s may be daisy-chained together to allow a\nsingle SPI sequence to program configuration or capturedata from several ICs in one operation.CSDATA REGISTER\n7654321\nFirst Bit shifted out of SODATA3DATA2 DATA4DATA5\n8DATA6DATA7DATA8 DATA1\nLast Bit shifted out of SO\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nHOLT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\n5HI-8429\nSUPPLY/OPEN SENSING\nWETTING CURRENT\nGND/OPEN SENSING\nWETTING CURRENT\nBUILT-IN TESTWhen programmed as Supply/Open sensors, CRn is set to a\nlogic 0. Referring to Figure 1, a switch in series with a diodeis closed to provide a pull down to ground of 30k . As withGND/Open, Supply/Open sensor levels are set by DACthresholds VLO and VHI.\nFor the Supply/Open case the wetting current into the sense\ninput is simply the current sunk by the effective 30k toGND. For V = 28V, I is 1mA. See Figure 2.\nFor GND/Open sensing, the CRn bit is set to 1. Referring to\nthe Block Diagram, Figure 1, this selection will connect a12k pull-up resistance through a diode to VDD. Thisresistance gives extra noise immunity for detecting the openstate while providing contact wetting current. Open andClosed states are detected according to the threshold levelsGLO and GHI programmed into the DAC Threshold Register,see Figures 14 - 17 for thresholds. When the SENSE inputexceeds GHI, the output of the sensor goes high. The outputof the sensor remains high until a voltage of less than GLO isdetected at the SENSE input, representing a valid Groundstate and causing the sensor output to go low. The Sensorwill maintain a Ground detect state until the SENSE inputbecomes greater than GHI. The difference GHI - GLOrepresents the hysteresis which improves noise immunityand reduces output chattering.\nIn GND/Open mode a current is sourced from the SENSE pin\nwhen it is grounded and VDD is powered, see Figure 3.This current called the “wetting current” serves to providecurrent through switches or relay contacts to prevent drycontacts and improve switch contact reliability.\nWriting a high in Control Register bit 9 puts the HI-8429 into\nthe Built-In Test (BIT) mode. In this mode setting a CRn bithigh for a particular sensor forces that comparator inputhigh. A zero in CRn forces the comparator input low. Toverify correct operation, the user must read from the DataRegister and compare this with the value written to CR1-8.\nCertain flight applications require periodic sensor\ntesting during flight. To ensure seamless transition betweenBIT mode and normal operation mode, the following stepsshould be followed:\n1) The host should read and record the Configuration\nRegister value for normal mode operation.\n2) The host should read and record the last value of\nthe Data Register before enabling BIT mode(CR9 = 1).\n3) Following test completion,Ω\nΩ\nΩ\nSENSE WET\nNOTE:\nbut while still in BITmode , the host should set the sensor outputs to\ntheir pre-test values by writing bits CR8 - CR1 withtheir corresponding Data Register pre-test valuesrecorded in step 2) above.\n4) Normal operation (CR9 = 0) is restored by writing\nthe Configuration Register with its pre-test valuestored in step 1).\nWhen the input DBNC is high, a debounce circuit on the\nsensor outputs is enabled (see Figure 1). The comparatoroutputs are sampled every 60ms, the state of the sensorregister bit is changed only when two consecutive samplesare identical. When debounce is enabled there will beapproximately 60ms delay before the sense data register isupdated.\nThe 24-bits [T24:1] in the DAC Register program the sensor\nthreshold levels for the eight discrete sensors. There are four6 bit DACs:\nGL5:0 GND/Open Low ThresholdGH5:0 GND/Open High ThresholdVL5:0 Supply/Open Low ThresholdVH5:0 Supply/Open High Threshold\nThe thresholds are programmed according to the twoformula below, for GND/Open and Supply/Open modesrespecitvely:\nVthresh(G/O) = VDD x (0.126 + D/91.6) Volts\nVthresh(S/O) = VDD x (0.144 + D/98.9) VoltsD is a value (0 to 63) programmed into the DAC\nFor further details see example DAC threshold\nprogramming on page 12.DEBOUNCE\nDAC THRESHOLD REGISTER\nT7 T6 T5 T4 T3 T2 T1VH2VH1 VH3VH4\nT8VH0\nLast Bit shifted out of SOT11 T10 T9 T12VH5VL0VL1VL2VL3VL4VL5T19 T18 T17 T16 T15 T14 T13\nFirst Bit shifted out of SOGH2GH1 GH3GH4\nT20GH0\nT23 T22 T21T24GH5GL0GL1GL2GL3GL4GL5\nMSBMSB\nLSBLSB\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nHOLT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\n6HI-8429\nI (mA)SENSE\nV (V)SENSE- 1 00 1 02 03 04 05 06 01.75\n1.55\n1.351.150.950.750.550.350.15\n-0.05\nFigure 2.\nSupply/Open Mode SENSE Input IV Characteristic (VDD = 15V)\nI( A )SENSEμ\nV (V)SENSE- 1 00 1 02 03 04 05 06 060\n5040\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10-20\nFigure 4.\nHi-Z SENSE Input IV Characteristic (VDD = 15V)I( A )SENSEμ\nV (V)SENSE- 1 00 1 02 03 04 05 06 0\nFigure 5.\nPower-Off SENSE Input IV Characteristics350\n300250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-50V =V =GNDDD LOGIC\nV =V =OpenDD LOGICI (mA)SENSE\nV (V)SENSE- 1 00 1 02 03 04 05 06 00.2\n-0.3\n-0.8\n-1.3\n-1.8\n-2.3\nFigure 3.\nGND/Open Mode SENSE Input IV Characteristic (VDD = 15V)\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.Downloaded fromArrow.com.\nHOLT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\n7FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION (cont.)\nSERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE\nCONFIGURATION REGISTER SPI TRANSFERSThe HI-8429 uses a SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) for host\naccess to the internal Configuration, DAC and Data Registerswhich program the sensor mode, threshold levels and storesensor status. Host serial communication is enabled throughthe active low, Chip Select ( ) pin, and is accessed via a four-wire interface consisting of Serial Data Input (SI) from the host,Serial Data Output (SO) to the host, the Serial Clock (SCK) andthe . All read / write cycles are completely self-timed.\nThe SPI protocol specifies master and slave operation; the HI-\n8429 operates as a SPI slave.\nThe SPI protocol defines two parameters, CPOL (clock polarity)\nand CPHA (clock phase). The possible CPOL-CPHAcombinations define four possible “SPI Modes”. The HI-8429operation is based on Mode 0 (CPHA = 0, CPOL = 0), whereinput data for each device is clocked on the rising edge of SCK,but data is also clocked out on the positive edge, see fig 14.\nAs seen in SPI timing diagrams Figures 6-10, SPI Mode 0 holds\nSCK in the low state when idle. The SPI bus transfers serial datain multiples of 8, 9 or 24 bits, depending on the type of data andnumber of devices. Once is asserted, the rising edge of SCKshifts the input data into the slave devices, starting with eachbyte's most-significant bit. A rising edge on completes theserial transfer and re-initializes the HI-8429 SPI for the nexttransfer.\nTo improve immunity from noise on , a write will only occur\nafter 8 SCKs are received. However if goes high after thisand before a word transfer is complete, the incomplete byte willbe latched into the device.\nBoth master and slave simultaneously send and receive serial\ndata (full duplex), per Figure 6. The HI-8429 maintains highimpedance on the SO output whenever is high. Themaximum SCK frequency is 10MHz. The HI-8429 logic is fullystatic and therefore there is no minimum SCK speed.CS\nCS\nCS\nCS\nCS\nCS\nCS\nOn power up or after a Hardware Reset all the sense input\ncircuits are disabled by default, they only become enabled aftera write to the configuration register. SEL0 and SEL1 are held lowfor sensor configuration changes, see table 1. Write / read timingis identical to Data Register transfers, except with the addedcomplication that the Configuration Register is nine bits ratherthan eight bits. Care should be taken to ensure correct bitalignment when shifting data into and out of the register,particularly when daisy-chaining multiple devices. Figures 6 - 10show examples of SPI data transfers, including a daisy-chained transfer.HI-8429\nTHRESHOLD REGISTER SPI TRANSFERS\nTo program the DAC thresholds, the SEL1 pin is held high and\nSEL0 held low, see table 1. Reading and Writing to thresholdregisters uses the same sequence and requires transferring24 bits (four sets of 6 bits) of continuous data, see Figure 9.\nThresholds are set by adjusting the DAC settings, according to\nTable 2. As with the other registers, data can be daisy chainedbetween multiple series SPI coupled devices (see Figure 12),an extra 24 clock cycles are required for each extra device.\nSENSEn Config Bit Bit #\nTable 2.

To read sensor data the\nSEL0 pin should be high.\nWhen goes low, the output of each sensor is latched into the\nData Register and DR8 is output at SO. The next 7 rising edgesof SCK shift out Data Register bits 7 through 1. Simultaneously,data presented at SI is shifted into the Data Register, DR8 iswritten on the first rising edge of SCK and DR1 on the eighthSCK rising edge.CSThe eighth SCK edge also causes the new DR8 value to be\noutput at SO (see Figure 8). This data transfer method allowsmultiple HI-8429 devices to be “daisy-chained” such that theData Registers from each device are cascaded to form a singleshift register. Figure 12 shows a typical configuration of threedaisy-chained HI-8429s to form a 24-input sensor array. Notethat when reading from more than one device, must remainlow throughout the data read sequence. Taking high andthen low again between eight-bit reads will cause the sensordata to be re-latched into the Data Registers, overwriting datashifted in from earlier HI-8429s in the chain.
