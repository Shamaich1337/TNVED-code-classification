It is \nrecommended to use the same types as used in the gate driver. For product information refer to www. IGBT-Driver.com/go/fiberoptics .\n \n2) The recommended transmitter current at the host controller is 20mA. A higher current may increase jitter or delay at turn -off. \n3) The typical transmitter current at the gate driver is 18mA. In case of supply undervoltage, the minimum transmitter current at the gate driver is 12mA: this is suitable for adequate plastic optical \nfibers with a length up to 10 meters.  \n4) This refers to the manufacturer ordering number, see www.igbt -driver.com/go/ext_erni\n. The \ncustomer -side connector as well as cables with different lengths can be  supplied by CONCEPT. Refer \nto the “Description & Application Manual for 1SP0635 SCALE -2 IGBT Drivers” for more information.  \n5) This refers to the manufacturer ordering number, see www.igbt -driver.com/go/ext_erni . These \nconnectors are to be used to connect 1SP0635x2M1  (master) or 1SP0635D2S1 (slave) to \n1SP0635D2S1 (slave) if parallel connection of IGBT modules is required. Cables with different lengths \ncan be  supplied by CONCEPT. Refer to the “Description & Application Manual for 1SP0635 SCALE -2 \nIGBT Drivers”  for more information.  \n6) If the specified value is exceeded, this indicates a driver overload. It should be noted that the driver is not protected against overload.  \n7) The given power can only be fully exploited without slaves 1SP0635D2S1  (no parallel connection of \nIGBT modules). If the specified value is exceeded, this indicates a driver overload. It should be noted \n1SP0635x2x1 -17  \nPreliminary Data Sheet  \n \nwww.IGBT -Driver.com  Page 6 that the driver is not protected against overload. From 70°C to 85°C, the maximum permissible output \npower can be linearly interpolated from the given data.  \n8) The given power can be fully exploited with slaves 1SP0635D2S 1 (parallel connection of IGBT \nmodules). If the specified value is exceeded, this indicates a driver overload. It should be noted that the driver is not protected against overload. From 70°C to 85°C, the maximum permissible output power can be linearly int erpolated from the given data. Note that the DC/DC converter on the master \n1SP0635x2M1 is dimensioned to supply the master as well as three connected slaves 1SP0635D2S1  at \nfull load.  \n9) The gate current is limited by the gate resistors located on the driver.  \n10) HiPot testing (= dielectric testing) must generally be restricted to suitable components. This gate driver is suited for HiPot testing. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended to limit the testing time to 1s slots. Excessive HiPot testing may lead to insulation degradation.  \n11) This limit is due to active clamping under switching conditions. Refer to  the “Description & Application \nManual for 1SP0635 SCALE -2 IGBT Drivers”.  \n12) Due to the Dynamic Active Advanced Clamping Function (DA\n2C) implemented on the driver, th e DC-\nlink voltage can be increased in the off- state condition (e.g. after emergency shut- down). This value is \nonly valid when the IGBTs are in the off state (not switching). The time during which the voltage can \nbe applied should be limited to short periods (< 60 seconds). Refer to  the “Description & Application \nManual for 1SP0635 SCALE -2 IGBT Drivers”.  \n13) The maximum dynamic voltage between auxiliary emitters of parallel -connected drivers due to \nasymmetrical operation at turn -on and turn -off must be limited t o the given value.  \n14) Maximum allowed rate of change of auxiliary emitter voltage of parallel connected drivers. This specification guarantees that the drive information will be transferred reliably even with high rate of change of auxiliary emitter voltages (asymmetrical operation).  \n15) Dynamic voltages between auxiliary emitter s of parallel connected drivers at turn -on and turn -off lead \nto equalizing currents over the X2 or X3  bus. The peak and RMS  values of the resulting current must \nbe limited to the given value.  \n16) Undervoltage monitoring of the secondary -side supply voltage (Viso to Vee and Vee to COM which \ncorrespond with the approximate turn -on and turn -off gate -emitter voltages). If the corresponding \nvoltage drops below this limit on 1SP0635x2M1  (masters), all paralleled IGBTs (master and slaves) are \nswitched off and a fault is transmitted to the status output. If the corresponding voltage drops below this limit on 1SP0635D2S1 (slaves), the corresponding IGBT is switched off. A fault will be generated \nby the gate -monitoring function on the master which will turn off all paralleled IGBT s after the \ncorresponding delay.  \n17) The mean value V\nGE,mean  of all gate voltages (master and all slaves) is filtered and compared to the \ngiven values at turn -on and turn -off. If the specified values are exceeded (V GE,mean <VGE,on,min  at turn -\non resp. V GE,mean >VGE,off,max  at turn -off) after the given filter delay , the driver turns off all parallel-\nconnected IGBTs and a fault is transmitted to the status output.  \n18) A dynamic Vce protection is implemented on the driver. The maximum allowed Vce voltage at turn -on \nis dynamically adjusted in order to better fit the IGBT characteristics at turn -on. At the end of the \nturn-on process , the given static value applies.  \n19) The resulting pulse width of the direct output of the gate drive unit for short -circuit type I (excluding \nthe delay of the gate resistors) is the sum of the response time plus the delay to IGBT turn -off. \n20) The turn -off event of the IGBT is delayed by the specified time after the response time.  \n21) Including the delay of the external fiber -optic links (cable length: 1m). Measured from the transition \nof the turn -on or turn -off command at the optical transmitter on the host controller side to the direct \noutput of the gate drive unit (excluding the delay of the gate resistors).  \n22) Output rise and fall times are measured between 10% and 9 0% of the nominal output swing. The \nvalues are given for the driver si de of the gate resistors with 2Ω/1 uF load. The time constant of the \noutput load in conjunction with the present gate resistors leads to an additional delay at the ir load \nside. \n23) Delay of external fiber -optic links. Measured from the driver secondary side (ASIC output) to the \noptical receiver on the host controller.  \n24) Measured on the host side. The fault status on the secondary side is automatically reset after the specified time.  \n1SP0635x2x1 -17  \nPreliminary Data Sheet  \n \nwww.IGBT -Driver.com  Page 7 25) Including the delay of the external fiber -optic links. Me asured from the transition of the turn -on or \nturn-off command at the optical transmitter on the host controller side to the transition of the \nacknowledge signal at the optical receiver on the host controller side.  \n26) The gate resistors and the auxiliary gate capacitor are not assembled on this IGBT gate driver. They \nmust be assembled by the user according to the paragraph on “ Gate Resistor and Auxiliary Gate \nCapacitor Assembly ”. \n27) The driver secondary side voltage is split into two distinct voltages on the drive r. The first one is the \nturn-on voltage which is regulated at about 15V. The difference between the total secondary side \nvoltage and the turn -on voltage is the turn -off voltage which is not regulated and mainly dependent \non the driver input voltage VDC and  the DC/DC converter power.  \n28) Partial discharge measurement is performed in accordance with IEC 60270.  \n29) Clearance and creepage distances are designed according to IEC 60077 -1. Refer to  the “Description &  \nApplication Manual for 1SP0635 SCALE -2 IGBT Drivers” for more information.  \n30) The fault status is set as long as the gate monitoring fault is present. The given value applies if the driver goes from the “off state” to the “on state” and the gate -emitter voltage of one or more parallel \nconnected drivers does not turn on. If the driver goes from the “on state” to the “off state” and the gate-emitter voltage of one or more parallel connected drivers does not turn off, the fault status is \napplied as long as the gate monitoring fault is present.  \n31) The maximum switching frequency is not defined, as it depends on the IGBT module used. Please consult the corresponding driver data sheet for more information.  \nGate Resistor and Auxiliary Gate Capacitor Assembly  \nThe turn -on and turn -off gate resistors as well as the auxiliary gate capacitor of 1SP0635x2xx drivers are \nadapted to  their respective IGBT modules.  \nRecommended gate resistors (R168, R169, R178 and  R179) : PR02 / 2W / 5% from Vishay.  \nRecom mended auxiliary gate capacit or (C105) : 1206 / X7R / 25V / 5%  \nThe following versions exist:  \n1700V IGBT Type  R178/  \nR179  R168/  \nR169  Resulting  \nRg,on  Resulting  \nRg,off  C105  \nFD1200R17HP4 -K_B2 3.9Ω 4.3Ω 1.95Ω 2.15Ω  not assembled  \nFD1200R17KE3 -K_B2 2.4Ω 6.2Ω 1.2Ω 3.1Ω not assembled  \n1MBI1600VC -170E 3.9Ω 4.7Ω 1.95Ω  2.35Ω  not assembled  \n1MBI1600VR -170E \n 3Ω  7.5Ω 1.5Ω 3.75Ω  not assembled  \nFZ1600R17HP4_B2  1.8Ω 1.8Ω 0.9Ω 0.9Ω not assembled  \nFZ1800R17HP4_B29  \n 1Ω  6.8Ω 0.5Ω 3.4Ω not assembled  \nFZ2400R17HP4  1Ω 3Ω 0.5Ω 1.5Ω not assembled  \nFZ2400R17HP4_B29  1.8Ω 2.4Ω 0.9Ω 1.2Ω not assembled  \nFZ2400R17HP4_B9  1.6Ω 1.8Ω 0.8Ω 0.9Ω not assembled  \nCM2400HCB -34N 1.6Ω 3.3Ω 0.8Ω 1.65Ω  not assembled  \n5SNA3600E170300  \n 1.2Ω  8.2Ω 0.6Ω 4.1Ω not assembled  \nFZ3600R17HP4(_B2)  \n 1.2Ω  6.8Ω 0.6Ω 3.4Ω not assembled  \n1MBI3600VD -170E \n 2.4Ω  3.9Ω 1.2Ω 1.95Ω  not assembled  \nFor the component position, refer to Fig s. 1 and 2 . \n \n1SP0635x2x1 -17  \nPreliminary Data Sheet  \n \nwww.IGBT -Driver.com  Page 8 Assembly Drawing  \n \nFig. 1: Assembly drawing of 1SP0635x2M1 with highlighted gate resistors  \n \nFig. 2: Assembly drawing of 1SP0635D2S1 with highlighted gate resistors  \nNote that the wires of the gate resistors should not project more than 1.6mm after soldering (excess length at \nbottom side).
