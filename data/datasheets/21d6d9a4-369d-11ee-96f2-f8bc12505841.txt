Each amplifier individually offers excellent dc \nprecision  with max imum  offset voltage and offset voltage drift \nof any dual bipolar op amp.  \nThe matching specif ications  are among the best available in any \ndual  op amp.  In addition, t he AD70 8 provides 5 V/μV min i-\nmum open -loop gain and guaranteed maximum input voltage \nnoise of 350 nV p-p (0.1 Hz to 10 Hz). All dc specifications \nshow excellent stability over tempera ture, with offset voltage \ndrift typically 0.1 μV/°C and input bias current drift of  \n25 pA/°C max imum .  \nThe AD708 is available in four performance grades. The \nAD708J is rated over the commercial temperature range of  \n0°C to 70° C and is available in a narrow body, P D I P.  T h e  \nAD708A and AD708B are rated over the industrial temperature \nrange of −40°C to +85°C and are available in a C E R D I P.   The AD708S is rated over the military temperature range of \n−55°C to +125°C and is available in a CERDIP military ver sion \nprocessed to MIL -STD -883B.  \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS  \n1. The combination of outstanding matching and individual \nspecifications make the AD708 ideal for constructing high \ngain, precision instrumentation amplifiers.  \n2. The low offset voltage drift and low noise of th e AD708 \nallow the designer to amplify very small signals without \nsacrificing overall system performance.  \n3. The AD708 10 V/µV typical open -loop gain and 140 dB \ncommon -mode rejection make it ideal for precision \napplications.  \n \nAD708 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

D | Page 10 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nCROSSTALK PERFORMANC E \nThe AD708 exhibits very low crosstalk as shown i n Figure 25, \nFigure 26, and Figure 27. Figure 25 shows the offset voltage \ninduced on S ide B of the AD708 when Side A output is moving \nslowly (0.2 Hz) from −10 V to +10 V under no load. This is the \nleast stressful situation to the part because  the overall power in \nthe chip does not change . Only the location of the power in the \noutput device changes. Figure 26 shows the input offset voltage \nchange  to Side B when S ide A is driving a 2 kΩ load. Here th e \npower changes  in the chip with the maximum power change \noccurring  at 7.5 V.  Figure 27 shows crosstalk under the most \nsevere  conditions. Side A is connected as a follower with  \n0 V input,  and is forced to sink and sour ce ±5 mA of output \ncurrent .  \nPower  = (30 V) (5 mA) = 150 mW  \nEven this large change in power causes only an 8 μV (linear) \nchange in the input offset voltage of Side B.  \n05789-025\nVOUTA  = 2V/DIVΔVOSB = 1µV/DIV2VA VOUTA\nVIN= ±10V\nB VOUTB10kΩ\n10Ω 10Ω\n \nFigure 25.
