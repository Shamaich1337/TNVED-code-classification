Internal Start-Up Sequence\n7.3.3 Soft Start\nThe device has a soft-start feature that starts the device typically with 500-mA peak current limit until V O = 1.8 V\nand 500 µs elapsed when the input current limit is set to unlimited (see Section 7.3.4 ). Afterwards, the output\nvoltage ramps in a series of discrete steps (see Figure 7-6 ).\n• When V O ≤ 1.8 V, peak current is limited to 500 mA typical for 500 µs.\n• When V O > 1.8 V, each step is 100 mV high and has a duration of 125 µs.\nThe total soft-start ramp-up time can be calculated with Equation 2 .\ntr(SS)= V O × 1.25BmsVWC - 1.75>ms? \n(2)\nwhere\n• t r(SS) is the rise time of the output voltage in milliseconds\n• V O is the output voltage in volts\nFigure 7-6  shows a typical start-up case.\nEN\nttr(SS)tVIH\nOutput\nVoltageTarget voltageInternal rampttd(EN)t\n0 V\nFigure 7-6.

The device cannot actively discharge the output\nto the target voltage and relies on the load current to discharge the output capacitor and decrease the output\nvoltage to the target value.\nEN\nttr(SS)tVIH\nOutput\nVoltagePrebias voltageTarget voltage\nDevice switchingInternal rampttd(EN)t\nDevice not switching\nFigure 7-8.

The maximum current\nthat flows is limited by the peak current limit. The output voltage decreases if the load is higher than the peak\ncurrent limit. If the output voltage falls below 1.25 typically, the short circuit protection is activated.

The device\nregulates the average input current for as long as the short-circuit condition exists. If the output voltage falls\nbelow 1.25 V typically, the short circuit protection is activated. For input current limit settings of 100 mA, 50 mA\nand 25 mA, the short circuit protection limits the input current to 26 mA on average. For input current limit setting\nof 10 mA, 5 mA, 2.5 mA, and 1 mA, the short circuit protection limits the input current to slightly above the typical\nvalues for each setting.

Get more information about WEBENCH tools at www.ti.com/webench .\n8.2.2.2 Inductor Selection\nThe inductor selection is affected by several parameters such as inductor ripple current, output voltage ripple,\ntransition point into Power Save Mode, and efficiency. See Table 8-2  for typical inductors.\nFor high efficiencies, the inductor must have a low DC resistance to minimize conduction losses. Especially at\nhigh-switching frequencies, the core material has a high impact on efficiency. When using small chip inductors,\nthe efficiency is reduced mainly due to higher inductor core losses. This needs to be considered when selecting\nthe appropriate inductor. The inductor value determines the inductor ripple current. The larger the inductor value,\nthe smaller the inductor ripple current and the lower the core and conduction losses of the converter. Conversely,\nlarger inductor values cause a slower load transient response. To avoid saturation of the inductor, the peak\ncurrent for the inductor in steady state operation is calculated using Equation 5 . Only the equation which defines\nthe switch current in boost mode is shown, because this provides the highest value of current and represents the\ncritical current value for selecting the right inductor.\nV - VIN OUTDuty Cycle Boost D =VOUT\n(4)\nPEAKIout Vin DI = +η (1 D) 2 L/c180\n/c180 /c45 /c180 /c180 f\n(5)\nwhere:\n• D = Duty Cycle in Boost mode\n• f = Converter switching frequency\n• L = Inductor value\n• η = Estimated converter efficiency (use the number from the efficiency curves or 0.9 as an assumption)\nNote\nThe calculation must be done for the minimum input voltage in boost mode.\nCalculating the maximum inductor current using the actual operating conditions gives the minimum saturation\ncurrent of the inductor needed. It is recommended to choose an inductor with a saturation current 20% higher\nthan the value calculated using Equation 5 . Possible inductors are listed in Table 8-2 .\nTable 8-2.

The recommended nominal output capacitor value is a single 22 µF . If, for any\nreason, the application requires the use of large capacitors which cannot be placed close to the IC, use a\nsmaller ceramic capacitor in parallel to the large capacitor. The small capacitor must be placed as close as\npossible to the VOUT and GND pins of the IC.\nIt is important that the effective capacitance is given according to the recommended value in Section 6.3. In\ngeneral, consider DC bias effects resulting in less effective capacitance. The choice of the output capacitance is\nmainly a tradeoff between size and transient behavior as higher capacitance reduces transient response\novershoot and undershoot and increases transient response time. Possible output capacitors are listed in Table\n8-3.\nThere is no upper limit for the output capacitance value.\nAt light load currents the output voltage ripple is dependent on the output capacitor value. Larger output\ncapacitors reduce the output voltage ripple. The leakage current of the output capacitor adds to the overall\nquiescent current.\nTable 8-3.

An X5R or X7R ceramic capacitor placed as close as possible to the VIN and GND\npins of the IC is recommended. This capacitance can be increased without limit. If the input supply is located\nmore than a few inches from the TPS63900 converter additional bulk capacitance can be required in addition to\nthe ceramic bypass capacitors. An electrolytic or tantalum capacitor with a value of 47 µF is a typical choice.\nWhen operating from a high impedance source, a larger input buffer capacitor is recommended to avoid voltage\ndrops during start-up and load transients.\nThe input capacitor can be increased without any limit for better input voltage filtering. The leakage current of the\ninput capacitor adds to the overall quiescent current.\nTable 8-4.

The input supply must be\nstable and free of noise to achieve the full performance of the device. If the input supply is located more than a\nfew centimeters away from the device, additional bulk capacitance can be required. The input capacitance\nshown in the application schematics in this data sheet is sufficient for typical applications.TPS63900\nSLVSET3D – MARCH 2020 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS63900\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nPCB layout is an important part of any switching power supply design. A poor layout can cause unstable\noperation, load regulation problems, increased ripple and noise, and EMI issues.\nThe following PCB layout design guidelines are recommended:\n• Place the input and output capacitors close to the device.\n• Minimize the area of the input loop, and use short, wide traces on the top layer to connect the input capacitor\nto the VIN and GND pins.\n• Minimize the area of the output loop, and use short, wide traces on the top layer to connect the output\ncapacitor to the VOUT and GND pins.\n• The location of the inductor on the PCB is less important than the location of the input and output capacitors.\nPlace the inductor after the input and output capacitors have been placed close to the device. You can route\nthe traces to the inductor on an inner layer if necessary.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 10-1  shows an example of a PCB layout that follows the recommendations of the previous section.\nFigure 10-1.
