MOSFET switching is terminated when a current greater than a threshold current  is drawn from this pin.  Switching resumes when the current being pulled from the pin drops to less than a threshold current.  A modulation of the threshold current reduces group pulsing. The threshold current is between 75 μA and 115 μA. \nThe ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin also senses line undervoltage \nconditions through an external resistor connected to the DC line voltage. If there is no external resistor connected to this pin, TinySwitch-4 detects its absence and disables the line undervoltage function.\nSOURCE (S) Pin:\nThis pin is internally connected to the output MOSFET source for \nhigh-voltage power return and control circuit common.\nTinySwitch-4 Functional Description\nTinySwitch-4 combines a high-voltage power MOSFET switch with a \npower supply controller in one device.  Unlike conventional PWM (pulse width modulator) controllers, it uses a simple  ON/OFF control to regulate the output voltage. \nThe controller consists of an oscillator, enable circuit (sense and logic), \ncurrent limit state machine, 5.85 V regulator, BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin undervoltage, overvoltage circuit, and current limit selection circuitry, over-temperature protection, current limit circuit, leading edge blanking, and a 725 V power MOSFET.  TinySwitch-4 incorporates additional circuitry for line undervoltage sense, auto-restart, adaptive switching cycle on-time extension, and frequency jitter.  Figure 3 shows the functional block diagram with the most important features.\nOscillator\nThe typical oscillator frequency is internally set to an average of  \n132 kHz. Two signals are generated from the oscillator: the maximum \nduty cycle signal (DC\nMAX) and the clock signal that indicates the \nbeginning of each cycle.\nThe oscillator incorporates circuitry that introduces a small amount of \nfrequency jitter, typically 8 kHz peak-to-peak, to minimize EMI emission.  The modulation rate of the frequency jitter is set to 1 kHz to optimize EMI reduction for both average and quasi-peak emissions.  \nFigure 5.   F requency Jitter.  \n600\n0 5 10136 kHz\n128 kHzVDRAIN\nTime (µs)\nPI-2741-021015500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0The frequency jitter should be measured with the oscilloscope \ntriggered at the falling edge of the DRAIN waveform.  The waveform in Figure 5 illustrates the frequency jitter.\nEnable Input and Current Limit State Machine\nThe enable input circuit at the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin consists \nof a low impedance source follower output set at 1.2 V.  The current \nthrough the source follower is limited to 115 μA.  When the current \nout of this pin exceeds the threshold current, a low logic level (disable) is generated at the output of the enable circuit, until the current out of this pin is reduced to less than the threshold current.  This enable circuit output is sampled at the beginning of each cycle on the rising edge of the clock signal.  If high, the power MOSFET is turned on for that cycle (enabled).  If low, the power MOSFET remains off (disabled).  Since the sampling is done only at the beginning of each cycle, subsequent changes in the ENABLE/UNDER- VOLTAGE pin voltage or current during the remainder of the cycle are ignored.\nThe current limit state machine reduces the current limit by discrete \namounts at light loads when TinySwitch-4 is likely to switch in the audible frequency range.  The lower current limit raises the effective switching frequency above the audio range and reduces the trans-former flux density, including the associated audible noise.  The state machine monitors the sequence of enable events to determine the load condition and adjusts the current limit level accordingly in discrete amounts.\nUnder most operating conditions (except when close to no-load), the \nlow impedance of the source follower keeps the voltage on the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin from going much below 1.2 V in the disabled state.  This improves the response time of the optocoupler that is usually connected to this pin.\n5.85 V Regulator and 6.4 V Shunt Voltage Clamp\nThe 5.85 V regulator charges the bypass capacitor connected to the \nBYPASS pin to 5.85 V by drawing a current from the voltage on the \nDRAIN pin whenever the MOSFET is off.  The BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin is the internal supply voltage node.  When the MOSFET is on, the device operates from the energy stored in the bypass capacitor.  Extremely low power consumption of the internal circuitry allows TinySwitch-4 to operate continuously from current it takes from the DRAIN pin. A bypass capacitor value of 0.1 μF is \nsufficient for both high frequency decoupling and energy storage. \nIn addition, there is a 6.4 V shunt regulator clamping the BYPASS/\nMULTI-FUNCTION pin at 6.4 V when current is provided to the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin through an external resistor.  This facilitates powering of TinySwitch-4 externally through a bias winding to decrease the no-load consumption to well below 50 mW.\nBYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION Pin Undervoltage\nThe BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin undervoltage circuitry disables the \npower MOSFET when the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin voltage drops \nbelow 4.9 V in steady state operation.  Once the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin voltage drops below 4.9 V in steady state operation, it must rise back to 5.85 V to enable (turn-on) the power MOSFET.\nOver-Temperature Protection\nThe thermal shutdown circuitry senses the die temperature.  The \nthreshold is typically set at 142 °C with 75 °C hysteresis. When the \ndie temperature rises above this threshold the power MOSFET is disabled and remains disabled until the die temperature falls by 75 °C, at which point it is re-enabled.  A large hysteresis of 75 °C (typical) is provided to prevent over-heating of the PC board due to a continuous fault condition.\nRev. G 10/204\nTNY284-290\nwww.power.com Figure 6.   A uto-Restart Operation.  \nPI-4098-021015\n0 2500 5000\nTime (ms)050\n10100200300\nVDRAIN\nVDC-OUTPUTCurrent Limit\nThe current limit circuit senses the current in the power MOSFET. \nWhen this current exceeds the internal threshold (ILIMIT), the power \nMOSFET is turned off for the remainder of that cycle. The current \nlimit state machine reduces the current limit threshold by discrete amounts under medium and light loads.\nThe leading edge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit comparator \nfor a short time (t\nLEB) after the power MOSFET is turned on.  This \nleading edge blanking time has been set so that current spikes caused by capacitance and secondary-side rectifier reverse recovery time will not cause premature termination of the switching pulse.\nAuto-Restart\nIn the event of a fault condition such as output overload, output \nshort-circuit, or an open loop condition, TinySwitch-4 enters into \nauto-restart operation.  An internal counter clocked by the oscillator is reset every time the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin is pulled low.   If the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin is not pulled low for 64 ms, the power MOSFET switching is normally disabled for 2.5 seconds (except in the case of line undervoltage condition, in which case it is disabled until the condition is removed).  The auto-restart alternately enables and disables the switching of the power MOSFET until the fault condition is removed.  Figure 6 illustrates auto-restart circuit operation in the presence of an output short-circuit.\nIn the event of a line undervoltage condition, the switching of the \npower MOSFET is disabled beyond its normal 2.5 seconds until the line undervoltage condition ends.\nAdaptive Switching Cycle On-Time Extension\nAdaptive switching cycle on-time extension keeps the cycle on until \ncurrent limit is reached, instead of prematurely terminating after the \nDC\nMAX signal goes low.  This feature reduces the minimum input \nvoltage required to maintain regulation, extending hold-up time and minimizing the size of bulk capacitor required.  The on-time extension is disabled during the start-up of the power supply, until the power supply output reaches regulation.\nLine Undervoltage Sense Circuit\nThe DC line voltage can be monitored by connecting an external \nresistor from the DC line to the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin.  During \npower-up or when the switching of the power MOSFET is disabled in auto-restart, the current into the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin must exceed 25 μA to initiate switching of the power MOSFET.  During power-up, this is accomplished by holding the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin to 4.9 V while the line undervoltage condition exists.  The BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin then rises from 4.9 V to 5.85 V when the line undervoltage condition goes away.  When the switching of the power MOSFET is disabled in auto-restart mode and a line undervoltage condition exists, the auto-restart counter is stopped.  This stretches the disable time beyond its normal 2.5 seconds until the line undervoltage condition ends.\nThe line undervoltage circuit also detects when there is no external \nresistor connected to the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin (less than  ~2 μA into the pin).  In this case the line undervoltage function is \ndisabled.\nTinySwitch-4 Operation\nTinySwitch-4 devices operate in the current limit mode.  When \nenabled, the oscillator turns the power MOSFET on at the beginning \nof each cycle.  The MOSFET is turned off when the current ramps up to the current limit or when the DC\nMAX limit is reached.  Since the \nhighest current limit level and frequency of a TinySwitch-4 design are constant, the power delivered to the load is proportional to the primary inductance of the transformer and peak primary current squared.  Hence, designing the supply involves calculating the primary inductance of the transformer for the maximum output power required.  If the TinySwitch-4 is appropriately chosen for the power level, the current in the calculated inductance will ramp up to current limit before the DC\nMAX limit is reached.\nEnable Function\nTinySwitch-4 senses the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin to determine \nwhether or not to proceed with the next switching cycle.  The sequence of cycles is used to determine the current limit.  Once a cycle is started, it always completes the cycle (even when the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin changes state half way through the cycle). This operation results in a power supply in which the output voltage ripple is determined by the output capacitor, amount of energy per switch cycle and the delay of the feedback.\nThe ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin signal is generated on the \nsecondary by comparing the power supply output voltage with a reference voltage.  The ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin signal is high when the power supply output voltage is less than the reference voltage.  In a typical implementation, the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin is driven by an optocoupler.  The collector of the optocoupler transistor is connected to the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin and the emitter is connected to the SOURCE pin. The optocoupler LED is connected in series with a Zener diode across the DC output voltage to be regulated.  When the output voltage exceeds the target regulation voltage level (optocoupler LED voltage drop plus Zener voltage), the optocoupler LED will start to conduct, pulling the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin low.  The Zener diode can be replaced by a TL431 reference circuit for improved accuracy.\nON/OFF Operation with Current Limit State Machine\nThe internal clock of the TinySwitch-4 runs all the time.  At the \nbeginning of each clock cycle, it samples the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE \npin to decide whether or not to implement a switch cycle, and based on the sequence of samples over multiple cycles, it determines the appropriate current limit.  At high loads, the state machine sets the current limit to its highest value.  At lighter loads, the state machine sets the current limit to reduced values. \nAt near maximum load, TinySwitch-4 will conduct during nearly all of \nits clock cycles (Figure 7).  At slightly lower load, it will “skip” additional cycles in order to maintain voltage regulation at the power supply output (Figure 8).  At medium loads, cycles will be skipped and the current limit will be reduced (Figure 9). At very light loads, the current limit will be reduced even further (Figure 10).  Only a small \nRev.

This provides tight regulation and excellent transient response.\nPower-Up/Down\nThe TinySwitch-4 requires only a 0.1 μF capacitor on the BYPASS/\nMULTI-FUNCTION pin to operate with standard current limit.  \nBecause of its small size, the time to charge this capacitor is kept to an absolute minimum, typically 0.6 ms.  The time to charge will vary in proportion to the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin capacitor value when selecting different current limits.  Due to the high bandwidth  of the ON/OFF feedback, there is no overshoot at the power supply output.  When an external resistor (4 M W) is connected from the \npositive DC input to the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin, the power MOSFET switching will be delayed during power-up until the DC line voltage exceeds the threshold (100 V).  Figures 11 and 12 show the power-up timing waveform in applications with and without an external resistor (4 M W) connected to the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE \nPI-2377-021015VEN\nVDRAINCLOCK\nDCMAX\nIDRAINVEN\nVDRAINCLOCK\nDCMAX\nIDRAIN\nPI-2667-021015\nRev.

Under start-up and overload conditions, when the conduction \ntime is less than 400 ns, the device reduces the switching frequency to maintain control of the peak drain current.\nDuring power-down, when an external resistor is used, the power \nMOSFET will switch for 64 ms after the output loses regulation.  The power MOSFET will then remain off without any glitches since the undervoltage function prohibits restart when the line voltage is low. \nFigure 13 illustrates a typical power-down timing waveform.  Figure 14 \nillustrates a very slow power-down timing waveform as in standby applications.  The external resistor (4 M W) is connected to the \nENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin in this case to prevent unwanted restarts.\nNo bias winding is needed to provide power to the chip because it \ndraws the power directly from the DRAIN pin (see Functional Description).  This has two main benefits.  First, for a nominal application, this eliminates the cost of a bias winding and associated components.  Secondly, for battery charger applications, the current-voltage characteristic often allows the output voltage to fall close to 0 V while still delivering power. TinySwitch-4 accomplishes this without a forward bias winding and its many associated components.  For applications that require very low no-load power consumption (50 mW), a resistor from a bias winding to the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin can provide the power to the chip.  The minimum recommended current supplied is 1 mA.  The BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin in this case will be clamped at 6.4 V.  This method will eliminate the power draw from the DRAIN pin, thereby reducing the no-load power consumption and improving full-load efficiency.\nCurrent Limit Operation\nEach switching cycle is terminated when the DRAIN current reaches \nthe current limit of the device.  Current limit operation provides good \nline ripple rejection and relatively constant power delivery independent of input voltage.\nRev. G 10/207\nTNY284-290\nwww.power.com BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION Pin Capacitor\nThe BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin can use a ceramic capacitor as \nsmall as 0.1 μF for decoupling the internal power supply of the \ndevice.  A larger capacitor size can be used to adjust the current limit.  \nFor TNY285-290, a 1 μF BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor \nwill select a lower current limit equal to the standard current limit of the next smaller device and a 10 μF BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin \ncapacitor will select a higher current limit equal to the standard current limit of the next larger device.  The higher current limit level of the TNY290 is set to 850 mA typical.  The TNY284 MOSFET does not have the capability for increased current limit so this feature is not available in this device.\n85 115 100 130 145 160 175 190 250 265 220 205 235\nInput Voltage (VAC)Maximum Over Power (W)40\n35\n30\n25\n20TNY290\nTNY280\nPI-6788-021015\nFigure 15.   C omparison of Maximum Overpower for TinySwitch-4 and  \n T\ninySwitch-III as a Function of Input Voltage (Data Collected from \n \n R\nDK-295 20 W Reference Design).\n \nRev. G 10/208\nTNY284-290\nwww.power.com Applications Example\nThe circuit shown in Figure 16 is a low cost, high efficiency, flyback \npower supply designed for 5 V, 4 A output from universal input using \nthe TNY290PG. \nThe supply features undervoltage lockout, primary sensed output \novervoltage latching shutdown protection, high efficiency (>80%), and very low no-load consumption (<50 mW at 265 VAC).  Output regulation is accomplished using a simple Zener reference and optocoupler feedback.\nThe rectified and filtered input voltage is applied to the primary \nwinding of T1.  The other side of the transformer primary is driven by the integrated MOSFET in U1.  Diode D1, C3, R1, and VR1 comprise the clamp circuit, limiting the leakage inductance turn-off voltage spike on the DRAIN pin to a safe value.  \nThe output voltage is regulated by TL431 U2.  When the output \nvoltage ripple exceeds the sum of the U2 (CATHODE D6) and optocoupler LED forward drop, current will flow in the optocoupler LED.  This will cause the transistor of the optocoupler to sink current.  When this current exceeds the ENABLE pin threshold current the next switching cycle is inhibited.  When the output voltage falls below the feedback threshold, a conduction cycle is allowed to occur and, by adjusting the number of enabled cycles, output regulation is maintained.  As the load reduces, the number of enabled cycles decreases, lowering the effective switching frequency and scaling switching losses with load.  This provides almost constant efficiency down to very light loads, ideal for meeting energy efficiency requirements.As the TinySwitch-4 devices are completely self-powered, there is no \nrequirement for an auxiliary or bias winding on the transformer.  However by adding a bias winding, the output overvoltage protection feature can be configured, protecting the load against open feedback loop faults.\nWhen an overvoltage condition occurs, such that bias voltage \nexceeds the sum of VR2 and the BYPASS/MULTIFUNCTION (BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL) pin voltage, current begins to flow into the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin.  When this current exceeds I\nSD the \ninternal latching shutdown circuit in TinySwitch-4 is activated.  This condition is reset when the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin current flowing through R12 and R13 drop below 18.75 \nμA \neach AC line \nhalf-cycle.  The configuration of Figure 16 is therefore non-latching for an overvoltage fault.  Latching overvoltage protection can be achieved by connecting R12 and R13 to the positive terminal of C2,  at the expense of higher standby consumption.  In the example shown, on opening the loop, the OVP trips at an output of 17 V.\nFor lower no-load input power consumption, the bias winding may \nalso be used to supply the TinySwitch-4 device.  Resistor R4 feeds current into the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin, inhibiting the internal high-voltage current source that normally maintains the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor voltage (C7) during the internal MOSFET off-time.  This reduces the no-load consumption of this design from 140 mW to 40 mW at 265 VAC.\nUndervoltage lockout is configured by R5 connected between the DC \nbus and ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin of U1.  When present, switching is inhibited until the current in the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin Figure 16.

This allows the start-up voltage to be programmed \nwithin the normal operating input voltage range, preventing glitching \nof the output under abnormal low voltage conditions and also on removal of the AC input. \nIn addition to the simple input pi filter (C1, L1, C2) for differential \nmode EMI, this design makes use of E-Shield™ shielding techniques in the transformer to reduce common mode EMI displacement currents, and R2 and C4 as a damping network to reduce high frequency transformer ringing.  These techniques, combined with the frequency jitter of TNY288, give excellent conducted and radiated EMI performance with this design achieving >12 dB μV of margin to \nEN55022 Class B conducted EMI limits.\nFor design flexibility the value of C9 can be selected to pick one of \nthe 3 current limits options in U1.  This allows the designer to select the current limit appropriate for the application.  \n•\n S\ntandard current limit (ILIMIT) is selected with a 0.1 μF BYPASS/\nMULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor and is the normal choice for \ntypical enclosed adapter applications.\n•\n W\nhen a 1 μF BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor is used, \nthe current limit is reduced (ILIMITred or ILIMIT-1) offering reduced RMS \ndevice currents and therefore improved efficiency, but at the expense of maximum power capability.  This is ideal for thermally challenging designs where dissipation must be minimized.\n•\n W\nhen a 10 μ F BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor is used, \nthe current limit is increased (ILIMITinc or ILIMIT+1), extending the \npower capability for applications requiring higher peak power or continuous power where the thermal conditions allow.\nFurther flexibility comes from the current limits between adjacent \nTinySwitch-4 family members being compatible.  The reduced current limit of a given device is equal to the standard current limit of the next smaller device and the increased current limit is equal to the standard current limit of the next larger device.\nKey Application Considerations\nTinySwitch-4 vs. TinySwitch-III\nTable 2 compares the features and performance differences between \nTinySwitch-4 and TinySwitch-III.  TinySwitch-4 is pin compatible to TinySwitch-III with improved features.  It requires minimum design effort to adapt into a new design.  In addition to the feature enhancement, TinySwitch-4 offers two new packages; eSOP-12B (K) and SO-8C (D) to meet various application requirements.\n TinySwitch-4 Design Considerations\nOutput Power Table\nThe data sheet output power table (Table 1) represents the minimum \npractical continuous output power level that can be obtained under the following assumed conditions:\n1.\n T\nhe minimum DC input voltage is 100 V or higher for 85 VAC \ninput, or 220 V or higher for 230 VAC input or 115 VAC with a \nvoltage doubler.  The value of the input capacitance should be sized to meet these criteria for AC input designs.\n2.\n E\nfficiency of 75%.\n3. M\ninimum data sheet value of I2f.\n4. T\nransformer primary inductance tolerance of ±10%.\n5. R\neflected output voltage (VOR) of 135 V.\n6. V\noltage only output of 12 V with a fast PN rectifier diode.\n7. C\nontinuous conduction mode operation with transient KP* value \nof 0.25.\n8.\n I\nncreased current limit is selected for peak and open frame \npower columns and standard current limit for adapter columns.\n9. T\nhe part is board mounted with SOURCE pins soldered to a \nsufficient area of copper and/or a heat sink is used to keep the SOURCE pin temperature at or below 110 °C.\n10.\n A\nmbient temperature of 50 °C for open frame designs and 40 °C \nfor sealed adapters.\n*Below a value of 1, KP is the ratio of ripple to peak primary current.  \nTo prevent reduced power capability due to premature termination of switching cycles a transient K\nP limit of ≥0.25 is recommended.  This \nprevents the initial current limit (IINIT) from being exceeded at \nMOSFET turn-on.\nFor reference, Table 3 provides the minimum practical power delivered from each family member at the three selectable current \nlimit values.  This assumes open frame operation (not thermally limited) and otherwise the same conditions as listed above.  These numbers are useful to identify the correct current limit to select for a given device and output power requirement.\nOvervoltage Protection\nThe output overvoltage protection provided by TinySwitch-4 uses an \ninternal latch that is triggered by a threshold current of approximately \n5.5 mA into the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin.  In addition to an internal filter, the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor forms an external filter providing noise immunity from inadvertent triggering.  For the bypass capacitor to be effective as a high frequency filter, the capacitor should be located as close as possible to the SOURCE and BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pins of the device.\nTable 2.

M inimum Practical Power at Three Selectable Current Limit Levels.\nRev. G 10/2010\nTNY284-290\nwww.power.com For best performance of the OVP function, it is recommended that a \nrelatively high bias winding voltage is used, in the range of 15 V - 30 V.  \nThis minimizes the error voltage on the bias winding due to leakage inductance and also ensures adequate voltage during no-load operation from which to supply the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin for reduced no-load consumption.\nSelecting the Zener diode voltage to be approximately 6 V above the \nbias winding voltage (28 V for 22 V bias winding) gives good OVP performance for most designs, but can be adjusted to compensate for variations in leakage inductance.  Adding additional filtering can be achieved by inserting a low value (10 W to 47 W) resistor in series \nwith the bias winding diode and/or the OVP Zener as shown by R7 and R3 in Figure 16.  The resistor in series with the OVP Zener also limits the maximum current into the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin.\nReducing No-load Consumption\nAs TinySwitch-4 is self-powered from the BYPASS/MULTI-\nFUNCTIONAL pin capacitor, there is no need for an auxiliary or bias \nwinding to be provided on the transformer for this purpose.  Typical no-load consumption when self-powered is <150 mW at 265 VAC input.  The addition of a bias winding can reduce this down to <50 mW by supplying the TinySwitch-4 from the lower bias voltage and inhibiting the internal high-voltage current source.  To achieve this, select the value of the resistor (R4 in Figure 16) to provide the data sheet DRAIN supply current.  In practice, due to the reduction of the bias voltage at low load, start with a value equal to 40% greater than the data sheet maximum current, and then increase the value of the resistor to give the lowest no-load consumption.\nAudible Noise\nThe cycle skipping mode of operation used in TinySwitch-4 can \ngenerate audio frequency components in the transformer.  To limit \nthis audible noise generation the transformer should be designed such that the peak core flux density is below 3000 Gauss (300 mT).  Following this guideline and using the standard transformer production technique of dip varnishing practically eliminates audible noise.  Vacuum impregnation of the transformer should not be used due to the high primary capacitance and increased losses that result.  Higher flux densities are possible, however careful evaluation of the audible noise performance should be made using production transformer samples before approving the design.  \nCeramic capacitors that use dielectrics such as Z5U, when used in \nclamp circuits, may also generate audio noise.  If this is the case, try replacing them with a capacitor having a different dielectric or construction, for example a film type.\nTinySwitch-4 Layout Considerations\nLayout\nSee Figure 17 for a recommended circuit board layout for TinySwitch-4.\nSingle Point Grounding\nUse a single point ground connection from the input filter capacitor to \nthe area of copper connected to the SOURCE pins.\nBypass Capacitor (CBP)\nThe BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor must be located \ndirectly adjacent to the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL and SOURCE \npins.\nIf a 0.1 μF b\nypass capacitor has been selected it should be a high \nfrequency ceramic type (e.g. with X7R dielectric).  It must be placed directly between the ENABLE and SOURCE pins to filter external noise entering the BYPASS pin.  If a 1 \nμF o\nr 10 μF b\nypass capacitor was \nselected then an additional 0.1 μF c\napacitor should be added across \nBYPASS and SOURCE pins to provide noise filtering (see Figure 17).ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE Pin\nKeep traces connected to the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin short and, \nas far as is practical, away from all other traces and nodes above source potential including, but not limited to, the bypass, drain and bias supply diode anode nodes.\nPrimary Loop Area\nThe area of the primary loop that connects the input filter capacitor, \ntransformer primary and TinySwitch-4 should be kept as small as \npossible.\nPrimary Clamp Circuit\nA clamp is used to limit peak voltage on the DRAIN pin at turn-off.  \nThis can be achieved by using an RCD clamp or a Zener (~200 V) and \ndiode clamp across the primary winding.  To reduce EMI, minimize the loop from the clamp components to the transformer and TinySwitch-4.\nThermal Considerations\nThe SOURCE pins are internally connected to the IC lead frame and \nprovide the main path to remove heat from the device.  Therefore all \nthe SOURCE pins should be connected to a copper area underneath the TinySwitch-4 to act not only as a single point ground, but also as a heat sink.  As this area is connected to the quiet source node, this area should be maximized for good heat sinking.  Similarly for axial output diodes, maximize the PCB area connected to the cathode.\nY Capacitor\nThe placement of the Y capacitor should be directly from the primary \ninput filter capacitor positive terminal to the common/ return terminal \nof the transformer secondary.  Such a placement will route high magnitude common mode surge currents away from the TinySwitch-4 device.  Note – if an input π (C, L, C) EMI filter is used then the inductor in the filter should be placed between the negative terminals of the input filter capacitors.\nOptocoupler\nPlace the optocoupler physically close to the TinySwitch-4 to \nminimizing the primary-side trace lengths.  Keep the high current, \nhigh-voltage drain and clamp traces away from the optocoupler to prevent noise pick up.\nOutput Diode\nFor best performance, the area of the loop connecting the secondary \nwinding, the output diode and the output filter capacitor, should be \nminimized.  In addition, sufficient copper area should be provided at the anode and cathode terminals of the diode for heat sinking.  A larger area is preferred at the quiet cathode terminal.  A large anode area can increase high frequency radiated EMI.\nPC Board Leakage Currents\nTinySwitch-4 is designed to optimize energy efficiency across the \npower range and particularly in standby/no-load conditions.  Current \nconsumption has therefore been minimized to achieve this performance.  The ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin under-voltage feature for example has a low threshold (~1 μ A) to detect whether an undervoltage \nresistor is present. \nParasitic leakage currents into the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin are \nnormally well below this 1 μ A threshold when PC board assembly is in \na well controlled production facility.  However, high humidity conditions together with board and/or package contamination, either from no-clean flux or other contaminants, can reduce the surface resistivity enough to allow parasitic currents >1 μA to flow into the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin.  These currents can flow from higher voltage exposed solder pads close to the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin such as the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin solder pad preventing  \nRev. G 10/2011\nTNY284-290\nwww.power.com the design from starting up.  Designs that make use of the under- \nvoltage lockout feature by connecting a resistor from the high-voltage rail to the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin are not affected.\nIf the contamination levels in the PC board assembly facility are \nunknown, the application is open frame or operates in a high pollution degree environment and the design does not make use of the under- voltage lockout feature, then an optional 390 k W resistor should be \nadded from ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin to SOURCE pin to ensure that the parasitic leakage current into the ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE pin is well below 1 μA.\nNote that typical values for surface insulation resistance (SIR) where \nno-clean flux has been applied according to the suppliers’ guidelines are >>10 M W and do not cause this issue.\nQuick Design Checklist\nAs with any power supply design, all TinySwitch-4 designs should be \nverified on the bench to make sure that component specifications are not exceeded under worst case conditions.  The following minimum set of tests is strongly recommended:Figure 17.   Recommended Circuit Board Layout for TinySwitch-4 with Undervoltage Lock Out Resistor.\n1.

M\naximum drain current – At maximum ambient temperature, \nmaximum input voltage and peak output (overload) power, verify drain current waveforms for any signs of transformer saturation and excessive leading edge current spikes at start-up.  Repeat under steady-state conditions and verify that the leading edge current spike event is below I\nLIMIT(MIN) at the end of the tLEB(MIN).  \nUnder all conditions, the maximum drain current should be below the specified absolute maximum ratings.\n3.\n T\nhermal Check – At specified maximum output power, minimum \ninput voltage and maximum ambient temperature, verify that the temperature specifications are not exceeded for TinySwitch-4, transformer, output diode, and output capacitors.  Enough thermal margin should be allowed for part-to-part variation of the R\nDS(ON) of TinySwitch-4 as specified in the data sheet.  Under \nlow-line, maximum power, a maximum TinySwitch-4 SOURCE pin temperature of 110 °C is recommended to allow for these variations.TOP VIEW\nPI-6651-021015Opto-\ncoupler+\n-High-Voltage\n+ - DC\nOUTInput Filter Capacitor\n*CHF/CBPOutput\nRectifier\nCBPSafety Spacing\nT\nr\na\nn\ns\nf\no\nr\nm\ne\nrPRI\nSEC BIAS\nDOutput Filter\nCapacitor\n*CHF is a 0.1 µF high frequency noise bypass capacitor (the high frequency 0.1 µF capacitor eliminates need for CBP if ILIMIT selection requires 0.1 µF).Maximize hatched copper \nareas (                ) for optimum heat sinking\nBP/M\nEN/\nUVY1-Capacitor\nSSSSPRI\nBIASTinySwitch-4\nRev.

IS1 is an accurate estimate of device controller current consumption at no-load, since operating frequency is so low under these conditions. \nTotal device consumption at no-load is the sum of IS1 and IDSS2.\nB.\n S\nince the output MOSFET is switching, it is difficult to isolate the switching current from the supply current at the DRAIN. An alternative is \nto measure the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin current at 6.1 V.\nC.\n B\nYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin is not intended for sourcing supply current to external circuitry.\nD. T\no ensure correct current limit it is recommended that nominal 0.1 μF / 1 μF / 1\n0 μF c\napacitors are used. In addition, the BP/M capacitor \nvalue tolerance should be equal or better than indicated below across the ambient temperature range of the target application. The \nminimum and maximum capacitor values are guaranteed by characterization.  \n         \nE.\n F\nor current limit at other di/dt values, refer to Figure 25.\nF. T\nNY284 does not have an increased current limit value, but with a 10 μF B\nYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor the current limit is the \nsame as with a 1 μF B\nYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTIONAL pin capacitor (reduced current limit value).\nG.\n T\nhis parameter is derived from characterization.\nH. T\nhis parameter is derived from the change in current limit measured at 1X and 4X of the di/dt shown in the ILIMIT specification.\nI.\n IDSS1 is the worst-case OFF-state leakage specification at 80% of BVDSS and maximum operating junction temperature. IDSS2 is a typical \nspecification under worst-case application conditions (rectified 265 VAC) for no-load consumption calculations.\nJ. B\nreakdown voltage may be checked against minimum BVDSS specification by ramping the DRAIN pin voltage up to but not exceeding \nminimum BVDSS.\nK.\n Au\nto-restart on time has the same temperature characteristics as the oscillator (inversely proportional to frequency).Nominal BP/M \nPin Cap ValueTolerance Relative to Nominal \nCapacitor Value\nMin Max\n0.1 μF -\n60% +100%\n1 μF -5\n0% +100%\n10 μF -5\n0% NA\nRev.
