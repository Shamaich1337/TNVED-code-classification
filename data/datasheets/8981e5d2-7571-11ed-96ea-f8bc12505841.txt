The HMC292ALC 3B is ideally suited for \napplications where small size, no dc bias, and consistent IC \nperformance are required. This mixer can operate over a wide local oscillator ( LO) drive level  of 9 dBm to 15 dBm. It perform s \nequally well as a b iphase modulator or demodulator. The \nHMC292ALC3B  eliminates the need for wire bonding, allowing \nuse of surface -mount manufacturing techniques.  \n \nHMC292ALC3B  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

### Component Summary: HMC292ALC3B

**Description:**
The HMC292ALC3B is a general-purpose, double-balanced monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) mixer designed for use as either an upconverter or downconverter. It operates within a frequency range of 14 GHz to 30 GHz and is housed in a compact, leadless, RoHS-compliant 12-terminal ceramic LCC package. This mixer is particularly advantageous in applications requiring small size, no DC bias, and consistent performance.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; operates within specified power levels.
- **Current Ratings:** IF source and sink current: ±3 mA.
- **Power Consumption:** Continuous power dissipation: 460 mW (at TA = 85°C, derating 5.12 mW/°C above 85°C).
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -40°C to +85°C.
- **Package Type:** 12-terminal ceramic LCC (E-12-4).
- **Special Features:**
  - Passive device (no DC bias required).
  - Wide IF frequency range: DC to 8 GHz.
  - High isolation: LO to RF isolation of 48 dB (typical).
  - Conversion loss: 9 dB (typical).
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** MSL 3 (according to JEDEC J-STD-020E).

**Typical Applications:**
The HMC292ALC3B is suitable for a variety of applications, including:
- Microwave and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) radios.
- Test equipment for RF applications.
- Point-to-point radio communications.
- Military electronic warfare (EW), electronic countermeasures (ECM), and command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) systems.

This component is ideal for systems that require efficient signal processing in the microwave frequency range, making it a versatile choice for both commercial and military applications.
