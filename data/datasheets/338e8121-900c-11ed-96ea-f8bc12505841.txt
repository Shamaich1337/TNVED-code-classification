Thanks to its adaptive ground current\nbehavior the device consumes only 90 /C0109A typ. of quiescent\ncurrent (no −load condition).\nThe regulator features low noise of 48 /C0109V\nRMS, PSRR of\n75 dB at 1 kHz and very good line/load transientperformance. Such excellent dynamic parameters, smalldropout voltage and small package size make the device an\nideal choice for powering the precision noise sensitivecircuitry in portable applications.\nA logic EN input provides ON/OFF control of the output\nvoltage. When the EN is low the device consumes as low as\n100 nA typ. from the IN pin.\nThe device is fully protected in case of output overload,\noutput short circuit condition or overheating, assuring a very\nrobust design.\nInput Capacitor Selection (C IN)\nInput capacitor connected as close as possible is necessary\nto ensure device stability. The X7R or X5R capacitor should\nbe used for reliable performance over temperature range.\nThe value of the input capacitor should be 1 /C0109F or greater for\nthe best dynamic performance. This capacitor will providea low impedance path for unwanted AC signals or noisemodulated onto the input voltage.\nThere is no requirement for the ESR of the input capacitor\nbut it is recommended to use ceramic capacitor for its low\nESR and ESL. A good input capacitor will limit theinfluence of input trace inductance and source resistanceduring load current changes.\nOutput Capacitor Selection (C OUT)\nThe LDO requires an output capacitor connected as close\nas possible to the output and ground pins. The recommended\ncapacitor value is 1 /C0109F, ceramic X7R or X5R type due to its\nlow capacitance variations over the specified temperaturerange. The LDO is designed to remain stable with minimum\neffective capacitance of 0.8 /C0109F. When selecting the capacitor\nthe changes with temperature, DC bias and package sizeneeds to be taken into account. Especially for small package\nsize capacitors such as 0201 the effective capacitance drops\nrapidly with the applied DC bias voltage (refer thecapacitor’s datasheet for details).\nThere is no requirement for the minimum value of\nequivalent series resistance (ESR) for the C\nOUT  but the\nmaximum value of ESR should be less than 0.5 /C0087. Larger\ncapacitance and lower ESR improves the load transient\nresponse and high frequency PSRR. Only ceramic\ncapacitors are recommended, the other types like tantalumcapacitors not due to their large ESR.Enable Operation\nThe LDO uses the EN pin to enable/disable its operation\nand to deactivate/activate the output discharge function(A−version only).\nIf the EN pin voltage is < 0.4 V the device is disabled and\nthe pass transistor is turned off so there is no current flow\nbetween the IN and OUT pins. On A −version the active\ndischarge transistor is active so the output voltage is pulled\nto GND through 34 /C0087 (typ.) resistor.\nIf the EN pin voltage is > 1.0 V the device is enabled and\nregulates the output voltage. The active discharge transistor\nis turned off.\nThe EN pin has internal pull −down current source with\nvalue of 150 nA typ. which assures the device is turned off\nwhen the EN pin is unconnected. In case when the EN\nfunction isn’ t required the EN pin should be tied directly to\nIN pin.\nOutput Voltage\nFB/ADJ pin could be connected to the output pin directly\nto compensate voltage drop across the internal bond wiring\nand PCB traces or to the middle point of the output resistordivider to adjust the output voltage.\nWhen connected to the output pin the output voltage of the\ncircuit is simply the same as the nominal output voltage ofthe LDO.\nWhen connected to the resistor divider the output voltage\nis the nominal output voltage multiplied by the resistors\ndivider ratio, see following equation. Corresponding\nschematic is shown at Figure 1.\nVOUT−ADJ/C0043VOUT−NOM/C0064/C04661/C0041R1\nR2/C0467 (eq. 1)\nWhere:\n•VOUT−ADJ is output voltage of the circuit with resistor\ndivider\n•VOUT−NOM is the LDO’s nominal output voltage\nFor good stability and fast transient response chose the R 1\nand R 2 values to have their currents I R1 and I R2 in range from\n10 to 100 /C0109A. The capacitor C 1 = 1 nF improves the stability\nand transient response as well.\nOutput Current Limit\nOutput current is internally limited to a 1.4 A typ. The\nLDO will source this current when the output voltage dropsdown from the nominal output voltage (test condition isV\nOUT−NOM – 100 mV). If the output voltage is shorted to\nground, the short circuit protection will limit the outputcurrent to 1.4 A typ. The current limit and short circuitprotection will work properly over the whole temperature\nand input voltage ranges. There is no limitation for the short\ncircuit duration.\nNCP186\nwww. onsemi.com\n11Thermal Shutdown\nWhen the LDO’s die temperature exceeds the thermal\nshutdown threshold value the device is internally disabled.The IC will remain in this state until the die temperaturedecreases by value called thermal shutdown hysteresis.Once the IC temperature falls this way the LDO is back\nenabled. The thermal shutdown feature provides the\nprotection against overheating due to some applicationfailure and it is not intended to be used as a normal working\nfunction.\nPower Dissipation\nPower dissipation caused by voltage drop across the LDO\nand by the output current flowing through the device needsto be dissipated out from the chip. The maximum powerdissipation is dependent on the PCB layout, number of used\nCu layers, Cu layers thickne ss and the ambient  temperature.\nThe maximum power dissipation can be computed byfollowing equation:\nPD(MAX)/C0043TJ/C0042TA\n/C0113JA[W] (eq. 2)\nWhere (T J − TA) is the temperature difference between the\njunction and ambient temperatures and θJA is the thermal\nresistance (dependent on the PCB as mentioned above).\nThe power dissipated by the LDO for given application\nconditions can be calculated by the next equation:\nPD/C0043VIN/C0064IGND/C0041/C0466VIN/C0042VOUT/C0467/C0064IOUT[W] (eq. 3)\nWhere I GND is the LDO’s ground current, dependent on\nthe output load current.\nConnecting the exposed pad and N/C pin to a large ground\nplanes helps to dissipate the heat from the chip.\nThe relation of θJA and P D(MAX)  to PCB copper area and\nCu layer thickness could be seen on the Figure 34.Reverse Current\nThe PMOS pass transistor has an inherent body diode\nwhich will be forward biased in the case when V OUT > V IN.\nDue to this fact in cases, where the extended reverse currentcondition can be anticipated the device may requireadditional external protection.\nPower Supply Rejection Ratio\nThe LDO features very high power supply rejection ratio.\nThe PSRR at higher frequencies (in the range above100 kHz) can be tuned by the selection of C\nOUT  capacitor\nand proper PCB layout. A simple LC filter could be added\nto the LDO’s IN pin for further PSRR improvement.\nEnable Turn −On Time\nThe enable turn −on time is defined as the time from EN\nassertion to the point in which V OUT  will reach 98% of its\nnominal value. This time is dependent on various\napplication conditions such as V OUT−NOM, COUT and T A.\nPCB Layout Recommendations\nTo obtain good transient performance and good regulation\ncharacteristics place C IN and C OUT  capacitors as close as\npossible to the device pins and make the PCB traces wide.\nIn order to minimize the solution size, use 0402 or 0201capacitors size with appropriate effective capacitance.\nLarger copper area connected to the pins will also improve\nthe device thermal resistance. The actual power dissipationcan be calculated from the equation above (PowerDissipation section). Exposed pad and N/C pin should betied to the ground plane for good power dissipation.\nNCP186\nwww. onsemi.com\n12ORDERING INFORMATION TABLE\nPart NumberVoltage\nOption\n(VOUT−NOM)Marking Option Package Shipping\nNCP186AMN080TBG 0.8 V ADJ With active discharge DFN12 \n(Pb−Free)3000 / Tape & Reel\nNCP186AMX120TAG (Note 6) 1.2 V FA XDFN8\n(Pb−Free)3000 or 5000 / Tape & Reel\n(Note 6)\nNCP186AMX150TAG (Note 6) 1.5 V FN\nNCP186AMX175TAG (Note 6) 1.75 V FC\nNCP186AMX180TAG (Note 6) 1.8 V FD\nNCP186AMX185TAG 1.85 V FL\nNCP186AMX250TAG (Note 6) 2.5 V FE\nNCP186AMX280TAG (Note 6) 2.8 V FF\nNCP186AMX295TAG (Note 6) 2.95 V FP\nNCP186AMX300TAG (Note 6) 3.0 V FG\nNCP186AMX330TAG (Note 6) 3.3 V FH\nNCP186AMX350TAG 3.5 V FJ\nNCP186AMX390TAG (Note 6) 3.9 V FK\nNCP186BMX120TAG 1.2 V HA Without active discharge XDFN8\n(Pb−Free)3000 or 5000 / Tape & Reel\n(Note 6)\nNCP186BMX150TAG (Note 6) 1.5 V HN\nNCP186BMX175TAG 1.75 V HC\nNCP186BMX180TAG (Note 6) 1.8 V HD\nNCP186BMX185TAG (Note 6) 1.85 V HL\nNCP186BMX250TAG (Note 6) 2.5 V HE\nNCP186BMX280TAG 2.8 V HF\nNCP186BMX300TAG 3.0 V HG\nNCP186BMX330TAG (Note 6) 3.3 V HH\nNCP186BMX350TAG 3.5 V HJ\nNCP186BMX390TAG 3.9 V HK\n†For information on tape and reel specifications, including part orientation and tape sizes, please refer to our Tape and Reel Packaging\nSpecifications Brochure, BRD8011/D.\n6.
