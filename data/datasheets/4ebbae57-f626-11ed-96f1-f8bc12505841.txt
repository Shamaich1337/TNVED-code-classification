An F-RAM is nonvolatile andperforms reads and writes similar  to a RAM. It provides reliabl e\ndata retention for 151 years while eliminating the complexities ,\noverhead, and system-level re liability problems caused by\nEEPROM and other nonvo latile memories. \nUnlike EEPROM, the FM24V01A performs write operations at\nbus speed. No write delays are incurred. Data is written to the\nmemory array immediately af ter each byte is successfully\ntransferred to the device. The next bus cycle can commencewithout the need for data polling. In addition, the product off ers\nsubstantial write endurance compared with ot her nonvolatile\nmemories. F-RAM also exhibits much lower power during writesthan EEPROM because write operations do not require an\ninternally elevated power supply voltage for write circuits. Th e\nFM24V01A is capable of supporting 10\n14 read/write cycles, or\n100 million times more w rite cycles than EEPROM. \nThese capabilities make the FM24V01A ideal for nonvolatile\nmemory applications, requirin g frequent or rapid writes.\nExamples range from data logg ing, where the number of write\ncycles may be critical, to demandi ng industrial controls where the\nlong write time of EEPROM can cause data loss. The\ncombination of features allows more frequent data writing with\nless overhead for the system.\nThe FM24V01A provides substantial benefits to users of serial\nEEPROM as a hardware drop-in  replacement. The device\nincorporates a read-only Device ID that allows the host todetermine the manufacturer, product density, and product\nrevision. The device specific ations are guaranteed over an\nindustrial temperature range of –40 \uf0b0C to +85 \uf0b0C.\nFor a complete list of related resources, click here .\nLogic Block Diagram\nAddress \nLatch16 K x 8\nF-RAM Array\nData Latch8\nSDACounter\nSerial to Parallel\nConverter\nControl LogicSCL\nWP\nA0-A2Device ID and \nManufacturer ID814\n8\nNote\n1.The FM24V01A does not meet the NXP I2C specification in the Fast-mode Plus (Fm+, 1 MHz) for IOL and in the High Speed Mode (Hs-mode, 3.4 MHz) for Vhys.

The memory array is\nlogically organized as 16,384 × 8 bits and is accessed using a\ntwo-wire (I2C) interface. The functional operation of the F-RAM\nis similar to serial EEPROM. T he major difference between the\nFM24V01A and a serial EEPROM with the same pinout is the\nF-RAM’s superior write perfor mance, high endurance, and low\npower consumption. \nMemory Architecture\nWhen accessing the FM24V01A, the user addresses 16K\nlocations of eight data bits each. These eight data bits are sh ifted\nin or out serially. The addresses are accessed using the two-wi re\nprotocol, which includes a slave address (to distinguish othernon-memory devices) and a two-byte address. The upper 2 bits\nof the address range are ‘don’t care’ values. The complete\naddress of 14 bits specifies  each byte address uniquely. \nThe access time for the memory operation is essentially zero,\nbeyond the time needed for the serial protocol. That is, the\nmemory is read or written at the speed of the two-wire bus. Unl ike\na serial EEPROM, it is not nece ssary to poll the device for a\nready condition because writes  occur at bus speed. By the time\na new bus transaction can be shifted into the device, a writeoperation is complete. This is explained in more detail in the\nMemory Operation on page 8 . \nTwo-wire Interface\nThe FM24V01A employs a bidirectional two-wire bus protocol\nusing few pins or board space. Figure 2  illustrates a typical\nsystem configuration us ing the FM24V01A in a\nmicrocontroller-based system. The two-wire bus is familiar to\nmany users but is described in this section. \nBy convention, any device that  is sending data to the bus is th e\ntransmitter while the target device for this data is the receiv er.\nThe device that is controlling the bus is the master. The maste r\nis responsible for generating the clock signal for all operatio ns.\nAny device on the bus that is be ing controlled is a slave. The\nFM24V01A is always a slave device. \nThe bus protocol is controlled by transition states in the SDA and\nSCL signals. There are four conditions including START, STOP,data bit, or acknowledge. Figure 3 on page 5  and Figure 4 on\npage 5  illustrate the signal conditions that specify the four states.\nDetailed timing diagrams are shown in the electricalspecifications section. \nThe FM24V01A does not meet the NXP I\n2C specification in the\nFast-mode Plus (Fm+, 1 MHz) for IOL and in the High Speed\nMode (Hs-mode, 3.4 MHz) for Vhys. Refer to DC Electrical\nCharacteristics on page 12  for more details.\nFigure 2.

All operations\nusing the FM24V01A should en d with a STOP condition. If an\noperation is in progress when a STOP is asserted, the operation\nwill be aborted. The master must have control of the SDA (not a\nmemory read) to assert a STOP condition. START Condition (S)\nA START condition is indicated when the bus master drives SDAfrom HIGH to LOW while the SCL signal is HIGH. All commands\nshould be preceded by a START condition. An operation inprogress can be aborted by asserting a START condition at anytime. Aborting an operation using the START condition will read y\nthe FM24V01A for a new operation. \nIf during operation the power supply drops below the specified\nV\nDD minimum, the system should issue a START condition prior\nto performing another operation. \nData/Address Transfer\nAll data transfers (including addresses) take place while the S CL\nsignal is HIGH. Except under the three conditions described\nabove, the SDA signal should n ot change while SCL is HIGH.Figure 3.

During this state, the transmit ter\nshould release the SDA bus to allow the receiver to drive it. T he\nreceiver drives the SDA signal LOW to acknowledge receipt ofthe byte. If the receiver does not drive SDA LOW, the condition\nis a no-acknowledge and the operation is aborted.\nThe receiver will fail to acknowledge for two distinct reasons,  the\nfirst being that a byte trans fer fails. In this case, the\nno-acknowledge ceases the current operation so that the partcan be addressed again. This allows the last byte to be\nrecovered in the event of a communication error. \nThe second and most common reason is that, the receiver does\nnot acknowledge to deliberately end an operation. For example,\nduring a read operation, the FM24V01A will continue to placedata on the bus as long as the receiver sends acknowledges(and clocks). When a read oper ation is complete and no more\ndata is needed, the receiver must not acknowledge the last byte .\nIf the receiver acknowledges the last byte, this causes theFM24V01A to attempt to drive the bus on the next clock while th e\nmaster is sending a new c ommand such as STOP.\nHigh Speed Mode (Hs-mode)\nThe FM24V01A supports a 3.4-MHz high-speed mode. A master\ncode (00001XXXb) must be issued t o place the device into thehigh-speed mode. Communication between master and slave\nwill then be enabled for speeds up to 3.4 MHz. A STOP condition\nwill exit Hs-mode. Single- and multiple-byte reads and writes a re\nsupported.Figure 5.

As shown in Figure 7 , the slave\naddress contains the device type or slave ID, the device selectaddress bits, and a bit that specifies if the transaction is a read\nor a write. \nBits 7–4 are the device type (slave ID) and should be set to\n1010b for the FM24V01A. These bits allow other function types\nto reside on the two-wire bus wi thin an identical address range .\nBits 3–1 are the device select address bits. They must match th e\ncorresponding value on the external address pins to select the\ndevice. Up to eight FM24V01A devices can reside on the same\ntwo-wire bus by assigning a different address to each. Bit 0 is  the\nread/write bit (R/W\n). R/W  = ‘1’ indicates a read operation and\nR/W = ‘0’ indicates a write operation. \nAddressing Overview\nAfter the FM24V01A (as receiver) acknowledges the slaveaddress, the master can place the memory address on the bus\nfor a write operation. The addr ess requires two bytes. Thecomplete 14-bit address is latched internally. Each access\ncauses the latched address value to be incremented\nautomatically. The current address is the value that is held in  the\nlatch; either a newly written value or the address following th e\nlast access. The current address will be held for as long as po wer\nremains or until a new value is written. Reads always use thecurrent address. A random read address can be loaded bybeginning a write operation as explained below. \nAfter transmission of each data byte, just prior to the\nacknowledge, the FM24V01A increments the internal address\nlatch. This allows the next sequential byte to be accessed with\nno additional addressing. After the last address (3FFFh) isreached, the address latch will roll over to 0000h. There is no\nlimit to the number of bytes that can be accessed with a single\nread or write operation. \nData Transfer\nAfter the address bytes have been transmitted, data transferbetween the bus master and the FM24V01A can begin. For a\nread operation the FM24V01A will place 8 data bits on the bus\nthen wait for an acknowledge from the master. If theacknowledge occurs, the FM24V01A will transfer the next\nsequential byte. If the acknowledge is not sent, the FM24V01A\nwill end the read operation. For a write operation, the FM24V01 A\nwill accept 8 data bits from the master then sends an\nacknowledge. All data transfer occurs MSB (most significant bit )\nfirst. Figure 7.

The major\ndifferences result from the hi gher performance write capability  of\nF-RAM technology. These improvements result in somedifferences between the FM24V01 A and a similar configuration\nEEPROM during writes. The comp lete operation for both writes\nand reads is explained i n the following sections. \nWrite Operation\nAll writes begin with a slave address, then a memory address.\nThe bus master indicates a write operation by setting the LSB o f\nthe slave address (R/W  bit) to a ‘0’. After addressing, the bus\nmaster sends each byte of data to the memory and the memory\ngenerates an acknowledge condition. Any number of sequential\nbytes may be written. If the end of the address range is reache d\ninternally, the address counter will wrap from 3FFFh to 0000h.\nUnlike other nonvolatile memory technologies, there is no\neffective write delay with F-RAM. Since the read and writeaccess times of the underlying memory are the same, the user\nexperiences no delay through th e bus. The entire memory cycleoccurs in less time than a single bus clock. Therefore, any\noperation including read or write can occur immediately followi ng\na write. Acknowledge polling, a  technique used with EEPROMs\nto determine if a write is complete is unnecessary and will alw ays\nreturn a ready condition.\nInternally, an actual memory write occurs after the 8th data bi t is\ntransferred. It will be complete before the acknowledge is sent .\nTherefore, if the user desires to abort a write without alterin g the\nmemory contents, this should be done using START or STOPcondition prior to the 8th data  bit. The FM24V01A uses no page\nbuffering. \nThe memory array can be write -protected using the WP pin.\nSetting the WP pin to a HIGH condition (V\nDD) will write-protect\nall addresses. The FM24V01A will not acknowledge data bytesthat are written to p rotected addresses. In addition, the addre ss\ncounter will not increment if wr ites are attempted to these\naddresses. Setting WP to a LOW state (V\nSS) will disable the write\nprotect. WP is pulled down internally. \nFigure 8  and Figure 9  illustrate a single-byte and multiple-byte\nwrite cycles in Fast-mode Plus (Fm+).

They are current\naddress read and selective address read. In a current address\nread, the FM24V01A uses the internal address latch to supplythe address. In a selective read,  the user performs a procedure\nto set the address to a specific value. \nCurrent Address & Sequential Read\nAs mentioned in the previous p aragraph, the FM24V01A uses an\ninternal latch to supply the address for a read operation. A\ncurrent address read uses the existing value in the address lat ch\nas a starting place for the r ead operation. The system reads fr om\nthe address immediately followin g that of the last operation. \nTo perform a current address read, the bus master supplies a\nslave address with the LSB set to a ‘1’. This indicates that a read\noperation is requested. After receiving the complete slave\naddress, the FM24V01A will begi n shifting out data from the\ncurrent address on the next clock. The current address is the\nvalue held in the inte rnal address latch. Beginning with the current address, the bus master can read any\nnumber of bytes. Thus, a sequential read is simply a current\naddress read with multiple byte transfers. After each byte the\ninternal address counte r will be incremented. \nNote  Each time the bus master acknowledges a byte, this\nindicates that the FM24V01A should read out the next sequentialbyte.  \nThere are four ways to properly terminate a read operation.\nFailing to properly terminate the read will most likely create a bus\ncontention as the FM24V01A attempts to read out additional\ndata onto the bus. The f our valid methods are:\n1. The bus master issues a no-acknowledge in the 9th clock \ncycle and a STOP in the 10th clo ck cycle. This is illustrated i n \nthe following diagrams. This method is preferred. \n2. The bus master issues a no-acknowledge in the 9th clock \ncycle and a STAR T in the 10th. \n3. The bus master issues a S TOP in the 9th clock cycle.\n4. The bus master issues a STA RT in the 9th clock cycle. \nFigure 11.

Th is\ninvolves using the first three b ytes of a write operation to se t the\ninternal address followed by s ubsequent read operations. To perform a selective read, the bus master sends out the slave\naddress with the LSB (R/W )  s e t  t o  0 .  T h i s  s p e c i f i e s  a  w r i t e\noperation. According to the writ e protocol, the bus master then\nsends the address bytes that are loaded into the internal addre ss\nlatch. After the FM24V01A acknowledges the address, the bus\nmaster issues a START condition. This simultaneously abortsthe write operation and allows the read command to be issuedwith the slave address LSB set to a ‘1’. The operation is now a\ncurrent address read.\nSleep Mode\nA low-power mode called Sleep Mode is implemented on the\nFM24V01A device. The device will enter this low power statewhen the Sleep command 86h is clocked-in. Sleep Mode entrycan be entered as follows:\n1. The master sends a START command.\n2. The master sends Reserved Slave ID 0xF8.3. The FM24V01A sends an ACK.\n4. The master sends the I\n2C-bus slave address of the slave\ndevice it needs to identify. The last bit is a ‘Don’t care’ val ue\n(R/W  bit). Only one device must acknowledge this byte (the\none that has the I2C-bus slave address).\n5. The FM24V01A sends an ACK.6. The master sends a Re-START command.\n7. The master sends Res erved Slave ID 0x86.\n8. The FM24V01A sends an ACK.9. The master sends STOP to ens ure the device enters sleep \nmode.\nOnce in sleep mode, the device draws I\nZZ current, but the device\ncontinues to monitor the I2C pins. Once the master sends a\nSlave Address that the FM24V01A identifies, it will “wake-up”and be ready for normal operation within t\nREC (400 \uf06ds max.). As\nan alternative method of determining when the device is ready,\nthe master can send read or write commands and look for anACK. While the device is waking up, it will NACK the master unt il\nit is ready.Figure 14.
