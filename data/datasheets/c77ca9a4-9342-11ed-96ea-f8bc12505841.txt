#### Description:
The LFCN-6400+ is a ceramic low pass filter designed for RF applications. Its primary function is to allow signals below a certain frequency (cut-off frequency) to pass while attenuating signals above that frequency. This is crucial in applications where it is necessary to eliminate unwanted high-frequency noise or harmonics from a signal.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Used in systems where it is essential to suppress harmonics generated by transmitters.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** Ideal for communication systems operating in the VHF and UHF bands.
- **Laboratory Use:** Suitable for experimental setups requiring precise filtering of RF signals.

#### Special Features:
- Excellent power handling capability (up to 8W).
- Compact size due to LTCC (Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic) construction.
- Temperature stable performance, ensuring consistent operation across a wide temperature range.
- Protected by U.S. Patent 6,943,646, indicating proprietary technology or design.

This low pass filter is particularly useful in RF applications where maintaining signal integrity while minimizing interference from higher frequency signals is critical.
