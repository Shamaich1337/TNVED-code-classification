Application information\nThe device is designed to provide high-level ESD protection for high-speed serial data buses such\nas HDMI, DisplayPort, eSATA and LVDS data lines.\nNote:  When designing the PCB, give careful consideration to impedance matching and signal\ncoupling. Do not connect the signal lines to unlimited current sources like, for example, a battery.\nDynamic resistance\nThe device uses an advanced clamping structure showing a negative dynamic resistance.\nThis snap-back behavior strongly reduces the clamping voltage to the system behind the ESD\nprotection during an ESD event. Do not connect unlimited DC current sources to the data lines to\navoid keeping the ESD protection device in snap-back state after exceeding breakdown voltage\n(due to an ESD pulse for instance).\nPESD4USB3B-TTS All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2021.
