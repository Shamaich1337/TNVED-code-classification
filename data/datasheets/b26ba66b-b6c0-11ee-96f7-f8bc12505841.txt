Functional Description\nFigure 1 illustrates the AB1 8X5 functional design.\nFigure 1. Detailed Block Diagram\nAB18X5 serves as a companion part for host processo rs including microcontrollers, radios, and digital\nsignal processors. It tracks time as in a typical RTC product and additionally provides unique powermanagement functionality that makes it ideal for high ly energy-constrained applications. To support such\noperation, the AB18X5 includes 3 distinct feature gr oups: 1) baseline timekeeping features, 2) advanced\ntimekeeping features, and 3) power management f eatures. Functions from each feature group may be\ncontrolled via I/O offset mapped registers. Thes e registers are accessed using either an I\n2C serial interface\n(e.g., in the AB1805) or a SPI serial interface (e.g., in the AB1815). Each feature group is described brieflybelow and in greater detail in subsequent sections.\nThe baseline timekeeping feature group supports the standard 32.786 kHz crystal (XT) oscillation mode for\nmaximum frequency accuracy with an ultra-low curren t draw of 55 nA. The baseline timekeeping feature\ngroup also includes a standard set of counters monitoring hundredths of a second up through centuries.

At only 14 nA, the temperature-compen sated RC oscillator mode provides an\neven lower current draw than the XT oscillator for applic ations with reduced frequency accuracy\nrequirements. A proprietary  calibration algorithm allows the AB 18X5 to digitally tune the RC oscillator\nfrequency and the XT oscillator frequency with accuracy as lo w as 2 ppm at a given temperature. In\nAutocalibration mode, the RC oscillator is used as the primary oscillation so urce and is periodically\ncalibrated against the XT oscillator. Autocalibration may be don e automatically every 8.5 minutes or 17\nminutes and may also be initiated via software. This  mode enables average current draw of only 22 nA\nwith frequency accuracy similar to the XT oscilla tor. The advanced timekeeping feature group also\nincludes a rich set of input and output configurat ion options that enables the monitoring of external\ninterrupts (e.g., pushbutton signals), the generation of clock outputs, and watch dog timer functionality. \nPower management features built into the AB18X5 enabl e it to operate as a backup device in both line-\npowered and battery-powered systems. An integrated power control module automatically detects when\nmain power (VCC) falls below a threshold and switc hes to backup power (VBAT). 256B of ultra-low\nleakage RAM enable the storage of key parameters when operating on backup power. \nThe AB18X5 is the first RTC to incorporate a number  of more advanced power management features. In\nparticular, the AB18X5 includes a finite state machi ne (integrated with the Power Control block in Figure 1)\nthat can control a host processor as it transitions between sleep/reset states and active states. Digital\noutputs can be configured to control the reset signal or interrupt input of the host controller. The AB18X5\nadditionally integrates a power switch with ~1 Ω impedance that can be used to cut off ground current on\nthe host microcontroller and reduce sleep current to  <1 nA. The AB18X5 parts can wake up a sleeping\nsystem using internally generated timing interrupts or externally generated interr upts generated by digital\ninputs (e.g., using a pushbutton) or an analog comp arator. The aforementioned functionality enables users\nto seamlessly power down host processors, leaving only the energy-efficient AB18X5 chip awake. TheAB18X5 also includes voltage detec tion on the backup power supply.\nAB18X5 Real-Time Clock with Power \nManagement Family\nDate of Issue: October 16, 2014 3.0 x 3.0 mm\nPage 5 of 37 Abracon Drawing #453568 Revision: C \n3. AB18X5 Application Examples\nThe AB18X5 enables a variety of system implementa tions in which the AB18X5 can control power usage \nby other elements in the system.  This is typically us ed when the entire system is powered from a battery \nand minimizing total power usage is critical.  The backup RAM in the AB18X5 can be used to hold key \nMCU parameters when it is powered down.\n3.1 VSS Power Switched\nIn the recommended implementation, the internal power switch of the AB18X5 is used to completely turn \noff the MCU and/or other system elements.  In this case the PSW/nIRQ2 output is configured to generate \nthe Sleep function.  Unde r normal circumstances, the PSW/nIRQ2pin is pulled to VSS with less than 1 ohm \nof resistance, so that the MCU receives full power.  The MCU initiates a SLP operation, and when the AB18X5 enters Sleep Mode the PSW/nIRQ2 pin is op ened and power is completely removed from the \nMCU.  This results in significant add itional power saving s relative to the other alternatives.  A variety of \ninterrupts, including alarms, timers and external interr upts created by a pushbutton as shown, may be used \nto exit Sleep Mode and restore MCU power.  The RAM of the AB18X5 may be used to retain critical MCU \nparameters.\n3.2 VCC Power Switched\nAn external transistor switch T may also be used to turn off power to the MCU.  This implementation allows switching higher current and maintains a common ground.  R can be on the order of megohms, so that negligible current is drawn when the ci rcuit is active and PSW/nIRQ2 is low.VCC\nVSSIRQVCC AB18X5\nMCUI2C/SPI\nVSSXO\nXIEXTI\nFOUT/nIRQR\nPSW/nIRQ2\nVCC\nVSSIRQVCC\nAB18X5MCUI2C/SPI\nVSSRT\nPSW/nIRQ2FOUT/nIRQ\nAB18X5 Real-Time Clock with Power \nManagement Family\nDate of Issue: October 16, 2014 3.0 x 3.0 mm\nPage 6 of 37 Abracon Drawing #453568 Revision: C \n3.3 Reset Driven\nIn another implementation the AB18X5 controls the system MCU using the reset function rather than \nswitching power.  Since many MCUs use much less  power when reset, this implementation can save \nsystem power in some cases.\n3.4 Battery Backup\nIn many systems the main power supply is a battery, so the AB18X5 can minimize its current draw by powering down the MCU and other peripherals.  This battery may be replaceable, and a supercapacitor charged via the AB18X5 trickle charger can maintain system time and key parameters when the main \nbattery is removed.VCC\nVSSnRST RESETVCC\nVSSAB18X5MCUI2C/SPI\nPSW/nIRQ2VCC\nVSSFOUT/nIRQ IRQVCC\nVSSAB18X5 MCUI2C/SPIVBAT\nBackup\nBattery/ \nSupercapXO\nXIMain \nBattery1.5k*\n* Total battery series impedance = 1.5k ohms, which may require an external resistor\nAB18X5 Real-Time Clock with Power \nManagement Family\nDate of Issue: October 16, 2014 3.0 x 3.0 mm\nPage 7 of 37 Abracon Drawing #453568 Revision: C \n4.

A typical \n32.768 kHz tuning fork crystal has a negative temperature coe fficient with a parabolic frequ ency deviation, which due to \nthe crystal alone can result in a change of up to 150 ppm across the entire operating temperature range of -40°C to 85°C \nin XT mode. Autocalibration mode timing accuracy is specified rela tive to XT mode timing accuracy from -10°C to 60°C.\n(2)Outside of this temperature range, the RC oscillator frequ ency change due to temperature may be outside of the allowable \nRC digital calibration range (+/-12%) for autocalibration mode.If this happens, an aut ocalibration failure will occur and the \nACF interrupt flag is set. The AB18X5 should be switched to use the XT oscillator as its clock source.
