The main power-switching circuit consists of twoN-channel MOSFETs (or a dual MOSFET), an inductor,and input and output filter capacitors. An all N-channelsynchronous-rectified design provides high efficiencyat reduced cost. Gate drive for the N-channel high-sideswitch is provided by a flying capacitor boost circuitthat uses a 0.1µF capacitor connected to BST. \nMajor circuit blocks of the MAX1966/MAX1967 are\nshown in Figures 1 and 2: \n•Control Logic\n•Gate Driver Outputs\n•Current-Limit Comparator\n•Clock Generator\n•Ramp Generator\n•Error Amplifier\n•Error Comparator\n•Soft-Start\n•5V Linear Regulator (MAX1967)\n•800mV Reference\n•Thermal Shutdown\nIn the MAX1996, most blocks are powered from V\nIN. In\nthe MAX1967, an internal 5V linear regulator stepsdown the input voltage to supply both the IC and thegate drivers. The synchronous-rectified gate driver isdirectly powered from 5V V\nL, while the high-side-switch\ngate driver is indirectly powered from V Lplus an exter-\nnal diode-capacitor boost circuit.\nResistorless Current Limit \nThe MAX1966/MAX1967 use the R DS(ON) of the low-\nside N-channel MOSFET to sense the current. Thiseliminates the need for an external sense resistor usual-ly placed in series with the output. The voltage mea-sured across the low-side R\nDS(ON) is compared to a\nfixed -305mV reference (Figures 1 and 2) .The peak\ninductor current limit is given by the equation below:\nMOSFET Gate Drivers\nThe DH and DL drivers are optimized for drivingMOSFETs with low gate charge. An adaptive dead-timecircuit monitors the DL output and prevents the high-side FET from turning on until the low-side MOSFET isfully off. There must be a low-resistance, low-inductance\nconnection from the DL driver to the MOSFET gate forthe adaptive dead-time circuit to work properly.Otherwise, the sense circuitry in the MAX1966/MAX1967 detects the MOSFET gate as off while thereis charge left on the gate. Use very short, wide tracesmeasuring no less than 50mils to 100mils wide if theMOSFET is 1in away from the MAX1966/MAX1967. Thesame type of adaptive dead-time circuit monitors theDH off edge. The same recommendations apply for thegate connection of the high-side MOSFET.\nThe internal pulldown transistor that drives DL low is\nrobust, with a 1.1 Ωtypical on-resistance. This helps\nprevent DL from being pulled up due to capacitive cou-pling from the drain to the gate of the low-side synchro-nous-rectifier MOSFET during the fast rise time of theinductor node. The gate drivers are capable of drivingup to 1A. Use MOSFETs with combined total gatecharge of less than 200nC and a maximum V\nTHof 3.5V. \nInternal Soft-Start\nThe MAX1966/MAX1967 feature an internally set soft-start function that limits inrush current. It accomplishesthis by ramping the internal reference input to the con-troller transconductance amplifier from 0 to the 0.8Vreference voltage. The ramp time is 1024 oscillatorcycles that begins when initial power is applied. At thenominal 100kHz switching rate, the soft-start ramp isapproximately 10ms. The soft-start does not function ifthe MAX1966/MAX1967 are shut down by pullingCOMP/EN low.\nHigh-Side Gate-Drive Supply (BST)\nGate-drive voltage for the high-side N-channel switch isgenerated by a flying-capacitor boost circuit (Figures 3and 4). The flying capacitor is connected between BSTand LX.\nOn startup, the synchronous rectifier (low-side MOS-\nFET) forces LX to ground and charges the boostcapacitor to 5V. On the second half-cycle, theMAX1966/MAX1967 turn on the high-side MOSFET byclosing an internal switch between BST and DH. Thisprovides the necessary gate-to-source voltage to drivethe high-side FET gate above its source at the inputvoltage. \nInternal 5V Linear Regulator \n(MAX1967)\nAll MAX1967 functions are internally powered from an\non-chip, low-dropout 5V regulator. The MAX1967 has amaximum regulator input voltage (V\nVIN) of 28V. The\nVCC pin must be connected to VL through a 10 Ωresis-\ntor and VL must be bypassed with a 2.2µF capacitor toGND.

The V IN-to-V Ldropout voltage is typi-\ncally 70mV at 25mA current, so when V VINis less than\n5V, V VLis typically V VIN - 70mV. \nThe internal linear regulator can source a minimum of\n25mA to supply the IC and power the low-side andhigh-side FET drivers.\nDuty-Factor Limitations for Low\nVOUT/VVINRatios\nThe MAX1966/MAX1967s ’ output voltage is adjustable\ndown to 0.8V. However, the minimum duty factor maylimit the ability to supply low-voltage outputs from high-voltage inputs. With high-input voltages, the requiredduty factor is approximately:\nwhere R\nDS(ON) x ILOAD is the voltage drop across the\nsynchronous rectifier. The MAX1966/MAX1967s ’ mini-\nmum duty factor is 10%, so the maximum input voltage(V\nVIN(DFMAX) ) that can supply a given output voltage is:\nIf the circuit cannot attain the required duty factor dic-\ntated by the input and output voltages, the output volt-age still remains in regulation. However, there may beintermittent or continuous half-frequency operation asthe controller attempts to lower the average duty factorby deleting pulses. This can increase output voltageripple and inductor current ripple, which increasesnoise and reduces efficiency. Furthermore, circuit sta-bility is not guaranteed.\nApplications Information\nDesign Procedure \nComponent selection is primarily dictated by the follow-ing criteria:\n1)Input Voltage Range : The maximum value\n(V\nVIN(MAX) ) must accommodate the worst-case\nhigh-input voltage. The minimum value (V VIN(MIN) )\nmust account for the lowest input voltage afterdrops due to connectors, fuses, and switches areconsidered. In general, lower input voltages pro-vide the best efficiency.\n2)Maximum Load Current : There are two current val-\nues to consider. Peak load current (I\nLOAD(MAX) )\ndetermines the instantaneous component stressesand filtering requirements and is key in determiningoutput capacitor requirements. I\nLOAD(MAX) alsodetermines the required inductor saturation rating\nand the design of the current-limit circuit. Con-tinuous load current (I\nLOAD ) determines the thermal\nstresses, input capacitor, and MOSFETs, as well asthe RMS ratings of other heat-contributing compo-nents such as the inductor.\n3)Inductor Value : This choice provides tradeoffs\nbetween size, transient response, and efficiency.Higher inductance value results in lower inductorripple current, lower peak current, lower switchinglosses, and, therefore, higher efficiency at the costof slower transient response and larger size. Lowerinductance values result in large ripple currents,smaller size, and poorer efficiency, while also pro-viding faster transient response. Except for low-cur-rent applications, most circuits exhibit a goodbalance between efficiency and economics with aminimum inductor value that causes the circuit tooperate at the edge of continuous conduction(where the inductor current just touches zero withevery cycle at maximum load). Inductor values lowerthan this grant no further size-reduction benefit.\nTable 1 shows representative values for some typical\napplications up to 5A. With proper component selec-tion, outputs of 20A or more are practical with theMAX1966/MAX1967. The components listed in Table 1were selected assuming a minimum cost design goal.The MAX1966/MAX1967 can effectively operate with awide range of components.\nSetting the Output Voltage \nAn output voltage between 0.8V and (0.9V x V VIN) can\nbe configured by connecting F Bpin to a resistive\ndivider between the output and GND (Figures 3 and 4).Select resistor R2 in the 1k Ωto 10k Ωrange. R1 is then\ngiven by: \nwhere V\nFB= 0.8V.\nInductor Selection\nDetermine an appropriate inductor value with the fol-\nlowing equation:\nwhere LIR is the ratio of inductor ripple current to aver-\nage continuous current at a minimum duty cycle.Choosing LIR between 20% to 50% results in a goodLVVV\nV f LIR IOUTIN OUT\nVIN OSC LOAD MAX=×−()\n×× ×      ()RRV\nVOUT\nFB12 1 =−\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7VV R IVIN DFMAX OUT DS ON LOAD() ( )   ≤+ ×()10VR I VOUT DS ON LOAD VIN +× () ()  /\nMAX1966/MAX1967Low-Cost Voltage-Mode PWM\nStep-Down Controllers\n10 ______________________________________________________________________________________compromise between efficiency and economy.

With any core material,the core must be large enough not to saturate at thepeak inductor current (I\nPEAK ):\nSetting the Current Limit\nThe MAX1966/MAX1967 provide current limit by sens-ing the voltage across the external low-side MOSFET.The current-limit threshold voltage is nominally -305mV.The MOSFET on-resistance required to allow a givenpeak inductor current is: \nor \nin terms of actual output current.\nA limitation of sensing current across MOSFET resis-\ntance is that current-limit threshold is not accuratesince the MOSFET R\nDS(ON) specification is not precise.\nThis type of current limit provides a coarse level of faultprotection. It is especially suited when the input sourceis already current limited or otherwise protected.However, since current-limit tolerance may be ±45%,this method may not be suitable in applications wherethis device ’s current limit is the primary safety mecha-\nnism, or where accurate current limit is required.\nOutput Capacitor Selection\nThe output filter capacitor must have low enough equiv-alent series resistance (ESR) to meet output ripple andload transient requirements, yet have high enough ESRto satisfy stability requirements. In addition, the capaci-tance value must be high enough to absorb the induc-tor energy going from a full-load to no-load condition ifsuch load changes are anticipated in the system.\nIn applications where the output is subject to large load\ntransients, the output capacitor ’s size depends primari-\nly on how low an ESR is needed to prevent the outputfrom dipping too low under load transients. Ignoring thesag due to finite capacitance:In applications with less severe load steps, the output\ncapacitor ’s size may then primarily depend on how low\nan ESR is required to maintain acceptable output ripple:\nThe actual capacitance value required relates to the\nphysical size and technology needed to achieve lowESR. Thus, the capacitor is usually selected by physi-cal size, ESR, and voltage rating rather than by capaci-tance value. With current capacitor technology, oncethe ESR requirement is satisfied, the capacitance isusually also sufficient. When using a low-capacity filtercapacitor such as ceramic or polymer types, capacitorsize is usually determined by the capacitance neededto prevent undershoot and overshoot voltages duringload transients.  The overshoot voltage is given by:\nGenerally, once enough capacitance is added to meet\nthe overshoot requirement, undershoot at the risingload edge is no longer a problem. \nStability and Compensation\nTo ensure stable operation, use the following compen-sation procedure:\n1) Determine accaptable output ripple and select the\ninductor and output capacitor values as outlined inthe Inductor Selection and Output Capacitor\nSelection sections.\n2) Check to make sure that output capacitor ESR zero\nis less than f\nOSC/π. Otherwise, increase capaci-\ntance until this condition is satisfied.\n3) Select R3 value to set high-frequency error-amplifi-\ner gain so that the unity-gain frequency of the loopoccurs at the output ESR zero:\nA good choice for R\n3is 50k Ω. Do not exceed 100k Ω.RV\nVRL\nCOUT\nVIN ESR OUT3680 10=\n×××Ω−  ()VLI\nVCSOARPEAK\nOUT OUT=×\n××  \n  2\n2RV\nLIR IESRRIPPLE\nLOAD MAX≤×  ()RV\nIESRDIP\nLOAD MAX≤\n()\nRmV\nILIRDS ON MAX\nLOAD MAX()\n()   ≤\n×+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7305\n12Rm V IDS ON MAX PEAK() / ≤305IILIRI PEAK LOAD MAX LOAD MAX =+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7×      () ()2\n4) Select compensation capacitor C 6so that the error\namp zero is equal to the complex pole frequencyLC of the inductor and output capacitor:\nInput Capacitor Selection\nThe input capacitor (C 2) reduces noise injection and\nthe current peaks drawn from the input supply. Thesource impedance to the input supply determines thevalue of C\n2. High source impedance requires high\ninput capacitance. The input capacitor must meet theripple current requirement (I\nRMS) imposed by the\nswitching currents. The RMS input ripple current isgiven by:\nFor optimal circuit reliability, choose a capacitor that\nhas less than a 10 °C temperature rise at the peak rip-\nple current.\nPower MOSFET Selection\nThe MAX1966/MAX1967s ’ step-down controller drives\ntwo external logic-level N-channel MOSFETs. The keyselection parameters are:\n1) On-resistance (R\nDS(ON) ) of both MOSFETs for cur-\nrent limit and efficiency\n2) Current capability of V L(MAX1967 only) and gate\ncharge (Q T)\n3) Voltage rating and maximum input voltage\nMOSFET Power Dissipation\nWorst-case conduction losses occur at the duty factorextremes. For the high-side MOSFET, the worst-casepower dissipation due to resistance occurs at minimuminput voltage:\nThe following switching loss calculation for the high-\nside N-FET provides an approximation, but is no substi-tute for evaluation:where C\nRSSis the reverse transfer capacitance of N1\nand I GATE is the peak gate-drive source/sink current\n(1A typical). For the low-side N-FET (N2), the worst-case power dissipation occurs at maximum input volt-age:\nThe low-side MOSFET on-resistance sets the\nMAX1966/MAX1967 current limit. See the Setting the\nCurrent Limit section for information on selecting low-\nside MOSFET R\nDSON . For designs supplying 5A or\nless, it is often possible to combine the high-side andlow-side MOSFETs into a single package (usually an 8-pin SO) as indicated in Table 1. For higher output appli-cations, or those where efficiency is more important,separate FETs are usually preferred.\nVery-Low-Voltage Applications\nThe MAX1966/MAX1967 are extremely versatile con-trollers that can be used in a variety of applicationswhere high efficiency, high output power, and opti-mized cost are important. One alternate connection,shown in Figure 5, is useful when a low-voltage supplyis to be stepped down to an even lower voltage at highcurrent. If an additional bias supply is available, it cansupply gate drive separately from the input power rail.This can either improve efficiency, or allow lower cost5V logic-level MOSFETs to be used in place of 3VMOSFETs.

Component Selection for Standard Applications\nPC Board Layout Guidelines \nCareful PC board layout is critical to achieving low\nswitching losses and clean, stable operation. Theswitching power stage requires particular attention. Ifpossible, mount all the power components on the topside of the board with their ground terminals flushagainst one another. Follow these guidelines for goodPC board layout:\n1) Keep the high-current paths short, especially at the\nground terminals. This practice is essential for sta-ble, jitter-free operation.\n2) Connect the power and analog grounds close to\nthe IC.\n3) The IC needs two bypassing ceramic capacitors for\ninput and supply. C1 isolates the IC from currentpulses at N1, and should be placed such that thepath between C1 and N1 is not shared with the IC.C7 bypasses the IC and should be placed adjacentto the IC.\n4) Keep the power traces and load connections short.\nThis practice is essential for high efficiency. Usingthick copper PC boards (2oz vs. 1oz) can enhancefull-load efficiency by 1% or more. Correctly routingPC board traces is a difficult task that must beapproached in terms of fractions of centimeters,where a few milliwatts of excess trace resistancecause a measurable efficiency penalty.\n5) LX and GND connections to N2 for current sensing\nmust be made using Kelvin sense connections toguarantee the current-limit accuracy. With 8-pin SOMOSFETs, this is best done by routing power to theMOSFETs from the outside using the top copperlayer, while connecting LX and GND inside (under-neath) the 8-pin SO package.\n6) When tradeoffs in trace lengths must be made, it is\npreferable to allow the inductor charging currentpath to be longer than the discharge path. Forexample, it is better to allow some extra distancebetween the inductor and the low-side MOSFET orbetween the inductor and the output filter capacitor.\n7) Ensure that the connection between the inductor\nand C3 is short and direct.  \n8) Route switching nodes (BST, LX, DH, and DL) away\nfrom sensitive analog areas (COMP, FB).\n9) Ensure that the C1 ceramic bypass capacitor is\nimmediately adjacent to the pins and as close tothe device as possible. Furthermore, the V\nINand\nGND pins of MAX1966/MAX1967 must terminate atthe two ends of C1 before connecting to the powerswitches and C2.Layout Procedure\n1) Place the power components first, with ground ter-\nminals adjacent (N2 source, C2, C3). If possible,make all these connections on the top layer withwide, copper-filled areas.\n2) Mount the MAX1966/MAX1967 adjacent to MOSFET\nN2, preferably on the backside opposite N2 inorder to keep LX, GND, and the DL gate-drive linesshort and wide. The DL gate trace must be shortand wide measuring 50mils to 100mils wide if theMOSFET is 1in from the MAX1966/MAX1967.\n3) The V\nINand GND pins of MAX1966/MAX1967 must\nterminate at the two ends of C1 before connectingto the power switches and C2. C1 ’s ground con-\nnection must be as close to the IC ’s GND pin as\npossible.\n4) On MAX1966, C7 must be connected to the VIN\nand GND pins with mimimum distance. On theMAX1967, C7 must be connected to VL and GNDpins with minimum distance.\n5) Group the gate-drive components (BST diode and\nC5) together near the controller IC.\n6) Make the MAX1966/MAX1967 ground connections\nto three separate ground planes: the output groundplane, where all the high-power components con-nect; the power ground plane, where the outputbypass capacitor C3 connects; and the analogground plane, where sensitive analog componentsconnect. The analog ground plane and powerground plane must meet only at a single pointdirectly beneath the IC. These two planes are thenconnected to the high-power output ground with ashort connection for the C3 capacitor to the sourceof the low-side MOSFET, N2 (the middle of the starground). This point must also be very close to theoutput capacitor ground terminal.\nRefer to the MAX1966/MAX1967 EV kit manual for a PC\nboard layout example.MAX1966/MAX1967Low-Cost Voltage Mode PWM\nStep-Down Controller\n______________________________________________________________________________________ 13TOP VIEW\n1\n2\n3\n4\n510\n9\n8\n7\n6BST\nDH\nLX\nGND VINVCCFBCOMP/EN\nMAX1967\nµMAXDL VLPin Configurations (continued)\nMAX1966/MAX1967Low-Cost Voltage-Mode PWMStep-Down Controllers\n14 ______________________________________________________________________________________Low-Cost Voltage Mode PWMStep-Down Controller\n9LUCSP, 3x3.EPSChip Information\nTRANSISTOR COUNT: 3334PROCESS: BiCMOS\nPackage Information\n(The package drawing(s) in this data sheet may not reflect the most current specifications.
