All devices in the family monitor the\npower rail and assert RESET  output when the power\nrail is under the threshold voltage target (V IT-). The\nthreshold voltage is programmed into the device to\nminimize external components. Built-in hysteresis\nprevents false triggering. The RESET  output is not\nvalid for supply voltage (V DD) under 0.75 V. The\nTPS312x family includes devices with active high\noutput for use as disable during malfunction and\nactive low outputs for most systems where high output\nindicates properly functioning system.\nThe TPS3123/3124/3128 also include the watchdog\ntimer functionality to monitor timely digital pulses from\nthe processor and issue an alert if the expected pulse\ndoes not arrive on time due to potential software\nfreeze or hang. Such integration of supply rail\nmonitoring and the watch dog timer feature is very\nhelpful in always on systems, such as Factory\nAutomation and Communications Infrastructure.\nIn addition the TPS3123/5/6/8 devices incorporate a\nmanual reset input, MR, to force RESET triggered by\nan event unrelated to the voltage rail monitoring of the\npulses monitored by the watch dog timer. A low level\nat MR causes RESET to become active. The\nTPS3124 devices do not have the input MR, but\ninclude a high-level output RESET same as the\nTPS3125 and TPS3126 devices.\nAll devices in the family are available in a 5-pin\nSOT23-5 package and are characterized for operation\nover a temperature range of –40°C to +85°C.\nMR\nGNDVDD RESET\nTPS3123J12XFRESETCVDD DVDD\nGND1.2 V\nTMS320UVC5402\nWDI\nTypical Low-Voltage DSP Applicationwww.ti.comTPS3123-XX, TPS3124-XX, TPS3125-XX, TPS3126-XX, TPS3128-XX\nSLVS227F – AUGUST 1999 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: TPS3123-XX  TPS3124-XX  TPS3125-XX  TPS3126-XX  TPS3128-XXTPS3123-XX, TPS3124-XX, TPS3125-XX, TPS3126-XX, TPS3128-XX\nSLVS227F – AUGUST 1999 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Optional configurations\ninclude devices with active-high and active-low output signals (TPS3124/3125/3126), devices with a watchdog\ntimer (TPS3123/3124/3128), and devices with manual reset ( MR) pins (TPS3123/3125/3126/3128). RESET\noutput is valid when the supply voltage, V DD, is above 0.75 V. For devices with active-low output logic, the device\nmonitors V DD and keeps RESET  low as long as V DD remains below the negative threshold voltage, V IT−. For\ndevices with active-high output logic, RESET remains high as long as V DD remains below V IT−. An internal timer\ndelays the return of the output to the inactive state (high) to ensure proper system reset. The delay time, t d,\nstarts after V DD rises above the positive threshold voltage (V IT− + V HYS). When the supply voltage drops below\nVIT−, the output becomes active (low) again. All the devices of this family have a fixed-sense threshold voltage,\nVIT–, set by an internal voltage divider, so no external components are required.\nThe TPS312x family is designed to monitor voltages listed on Table 9-2 . For devices with the manual reset\nfunctionality, a low level at MR causes RESET  to become active. For devices with the watch dog timer\nfunctionality, when the supervising system fails to retrigger the watchdog circuit within the time-out interval t tout =\n0.8 s, RESET output becomes active for the time period (t d). This event also reinitializes the watchdog timer. The\ndevices are available in a 5-pin SOT-23 package and are characterized for operation over a temperature range\nof −40°C to 85°C.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nR1\nR2\nR3\nReference\nVoltage\nTransition\nDetectorWatchdog\nLogic and\nTimerReset\nLogic and\nTimerDevice Power SupplyVDD\nMR(1)\nGND\nWD(2)RESET(3)RESET\nNOTES:\n(1) TPS3123/5/6/8\n(2) TPS3123/4/8\n(3) TPS3124/5/6\nFigure 8-1.

#### Description:
The **TPS3128E18DBVT** is part of the TPS312x family of ultra-low voltage processor supervisory circuits designed by Texas Instruments. It primarily functions as a voltage supervisor, monitoring supply voltages down to 1.2 V and providing reset signals to ensure proper initialization and operation of digital systems. The device asserts a reset output when the supply voltage falls below a predetermined threshold, ensuring that the system does not operate under unsafe voltage conditions. 

#### Typical Applications:
- **Portable/Battery-Powered Equipment:** The low power consumption makes it ideal for devices that rely on battery power.
- **Wireless Communication Systems:** Ensures reliable operation by monitoring supply voltages.
- **Factory Automation:** Provides system reset capabilities to maintain operational integrity.
- **Servers and Building Automation:** Monitors voltage levels to prevent system failures due to power issues.

The TPS3128E18DBVT is particularly useful in applications where maintaining system stability and reliability is critical, especially in environments where power fluctuations may occur.
