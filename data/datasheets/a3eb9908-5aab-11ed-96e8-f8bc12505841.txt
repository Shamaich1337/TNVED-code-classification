Address and data \nare transferred serially through an I 2C interface. The \nclock/calendar provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, \ndate, month, and year information. The end of the month \ndate is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than \n31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock \noperates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an \nAM/PM indicator. The DS1308 has a built-in power-sense \ncircuit that detects power failures and automatically \nswitches to the V BAT supply.\nOperation\nThe DS1308 operates as a slave device on the serial bus. \nAccess is obtained by implementing a START condition \nand providing a device identification code, followed by \ndata. Subsequent registers can be accessed sequen -\ntially until a STOP condition is executed. The device is \nfully accessible and data can be written and read when \nVCC is greater than V PF. However, when V CC falls below VPF, the internal clock registers are blocked from any \naccess. If V BAT is greater than V CC, the device power is \nswitched from V CC to V BAT when V CC drops below V PF. \nIf VBAT is less than V PF, the device power is switched \nfrom V CC to V BAT when V CC drops below V BAT. The \noscillator and timekeeping functions are maintained \nfrom the V BAT source until V CC returns above V PF, read \nand write access is allowed after t REC. The Functional \nDiagram  shows the main elements of the DS1308.\nAn enable bit in the seconds register (CH) controls the \noscillator. Oscillator startup times are highly dependent \nupon crystal characteristics, PCB leakage, and layout. \nHigh ESR and excessive capacitive loads are the major \ncontributors to long startup times. A circuit using a crystal \nwith the recommended characteristics and proper layout \nusually starts within 1 second.\nOn the first application of power to the device, the time \nand date registers are reset to 01/01/00 01 00:00:00 (DD/\nMM/YY DOW HH:MM:SS), and CH bit in the seconds \nregister is set to 0.\nDS1308 Low-Current I 2C RTC with 56-Byte NV RAM\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 8DS1308NN/4 /32 EXTSYNC\nCONTROL LOGIC\nOSC-1HzPOWER CONTROL\nRAM\nCLOCK AND\nCALENDAR REGISTERS/2128Hz OSC-1Hz\nSQW/CLKINX1\nX2\nSCL\nSDA4.096kHz8.192kHz32.768kHz\nMUX/\nBUFFER\nDIVIDEREXT-1Hz\nSERIAL BUS\nINTERFACE AND\nADDRESS\nREGISTERVCC\nVBAT\nFreshness Seal Mode\nWhen a battery is first attached to the device, the device \ndoes not immediately provide battery-backup power to \nthe RTC or internal circuitry. After V CC exceeds V PF, \nthe devices leave the freshness seal mode and provide \nbattery-backup power whenever V CC subsequently falls \nbelow V BAT. This mode allows attachment of the battery \nduring product manufacturing, but no battery capacity is \nconsumed until after the system has been activated for \nthe first time. As a result, minimum battery energy is used \nduring storage and shipping.\nOscillator Circuit\nThe DS1308 uses an external 6pF 32.768kHz crystal. The \noscillator circuit does not require any external resistors or \ncapacitors to operate. See Table 2  for the external crystal \nparameters. The Functional Diagram  shows a simplified \nschematic of the oscillator circuit. The startup time is \nusually less than 1 second when using a crystal with the \nspecified characteristics.\nWhenever V CC > V PF, a 5Fs glitch filter at the output of \nthe crystal oscillator is enabled.Clock Accuracy\nThe accuracy of the clock is dependent upon the \naccuracy of the crystal and the accuracy of the match \nbetween the capacitive load of the oscillator circuit and \nthe capacitive load for which the crystal was trimmed. \nCrystal frequency drift caused by temperature shifts \ncreates additional error. External circuit noise coupled \ninto the oscillator circuit can result in the clock running \nfast. Figure 3  shows a typical PCB layout for isolating \nthe crystal and oscillator from noise. Refer to Application \nNote 58: Crystal Considerations with Maxim Real-Time \nClocks (RTCs)  for detailed information.\nTable 1. Power Control\nTable 2.

The RTC registers and control register are \nlocated in address locations 00h–07h. The RAM regis -\nters are located in address locations 08h–3Fh. During a \nmultibyte access, when the register pointer reaches 3Fh \n(the end of RAM space) it wraps around to location 00h \n(the beginning of the clock space). On an I 2C START, or \nregister pointer incrementing to location 00h, the current \ntime and date is transferred to a second set of registers. \nThe time and date in the secondary registers are read in \na multibyte data transfer, while the clock continues to run. \nThis eliminates the need to re-read the registers in case \nof an update of the main registers during a read.\nClock and Calendar\nThe time and calendar information is obtained by reading \nthe appropriate register bytes. The time and calendar are \nset or initialized by writing the appropriate register bytes. \nThe contents of the time and calendar registers are in the \nBCD format. Bit 7 of Register 0 is the clock halt (CH) bit. \nWhen this bit is set to 1, the oscillator is disabled. When \ncleared to 0, the oscillator is enabled. The clock can \nbe halted whenever the timekeeping functions are not \nrequired, which minimizes V BAT current (I BATDAT ) when \nVCC is not applied.The day-of-week register increments at midnight. Values \nthat correspond to the day of week are user-defined \nbut must be sequential (i.e., if 1 equals Sunday, then \n2 equals Monday, and so on). Illogical time and date \nentries result in undefined operation.\nWhen reading or writing the time and date registers, \nsecondary (user) buffers are used to prevent errors when \nthe internal registers update. When reading the time and \ndate registers, the user buffers are synchronized to the \ninternal registers on any START and when the register \npointer rolls over to zero. The countdown chain is reset \nwhenever the seconds register is written. Write transfers \noccur on the acknowledge from the DS1308. Once the \ncountdown chain is reset, to avoid rollover issues the \nremaining time and date registers must be written within \n1 second. The 1Hz square-wave output, if enabled, \ntransitions high 500ms after the seconds data transfer, \nprovided the oscillator is already running.\nThe DS1308 runs in either 12-hour or 24-hour mode. \nBit 6 of the hours register is defined as the 12-hour or \n24-hour mode-select bit. When high, the 12-hour mode \nis selected. In the 12-hour mode, bit 5 is the AM/PM bit, \nwith logic high being PM. In the 24-hour mode, bit 5 is the \n20-hour bit (20–23 hours). If the 12/ 24-hour mode select \nis changed, the hours register must be re-initialized to \nthe new format.\nTable 3.

Controls the output level of the SQW/CLKIN pin when the square-wave output is disabled \nand V CC>VPF. If SQWE = 0, the logic level on the SQW/CLKIN pin is 1 if OUT = 1; it is 0 if OUT = 0. See Table 4 .\nBit 6: Enable Clock Input (ECLK).  This bit controls the direction of the SQW/CLKIN pin (see Table 4 ). When ECLK =  1, \nthe SQW/CLKIN pin is an input, with the expected input rate defined by the states of RS1 and RS0. When ECLK = 0, the \nSQW/CLKIN pin is an output, with the square-wave frequency defined by the states of RS1 and RS0.\nBit 5: Oscillator Stop Flag (OSF).  A logic 1 in this bit indicates that the oscillator has stopped or was stopped for some \ntime period and can be used to judge the validity of the clock and calendar data. This bit is edge triggered, and is set \nto logic 1 when the internal circuitry senses the oscillator has transitioned from a normal run state to a STOP condition. \nThe following are examples of conditions that may cause the OSF bit to be set:\n The first time power is applied.\n The voltage present on V CC and V BAT are insufficient to support oscillation.\n The CH bit is set to 1, disabling the oscillator.\n External influences on the crystal (i.e., noise, leakage, etc.).\nThis bit remains at logic 1 until written to logic 0. This bit can only be written to logic 0. Attempting to write OSF to logic 1 \nleaves the value unchanged.\nBit 4: Square-Wave Enable (SQWE).  When set to logic 1, this bit enables the oscillator output to operate with either \nVCC or V BAT applied. The frequency of the square-wave output depends upon the value of the RS0 and RS1 bits.\nBit 3: Loss of Signal (LOS).  This status bit indicates the state of the CLKIN pin. The LOS bit is set to 1 when the RTC \ncounter is no longer conditioned by the external clock. This occurs when 1) ECLK = 0, or 2) when the CLKIN input signal \nstops toggling, or 3) when the CLKIN frequency differs by more than Q0.8% from the selected input frequency. This bit \nremains a 1 until written to 0. Attempting to write LOS = 1 leaves the value unchanged. Clearing the LOS flag when the \nCLKIN frequency is invalid inhibits subsequent detections of the input frequency deviation.\nBit 2: Battery Backup Clock (BBCLK).  When set to logic 1, this bit enables the SQW/CLKIN I/O while the part is pow -\nered by V BAT. When set to logic 0, this bit disables the SQW/CLKIN I/O while the part is powered by V BAT.\nBits 1 and 0: Rate Select (RS1 and RS0).  These bits control the frequency of the SQW/CLKIN output when the square-\nwave has been enabled (SQWE = 1). Table 4  lists the square-wave frequencies that can be selected with the RS bits.\nTable 4.

The 1Hz from the \ndivider (Ext-1Hz, see Functional Diagram ) is used to \ncorrect the 1Hz that is derived from the 32.768kHz oscil -\nlator (Osc-1Hz). As Osc-1Hz drifts in relation to Ext-1Hz, \nOsc-1Hz is digitally adjusted.\nAs shown in the Functional Diagram , the three highest \nfrequencies driving the SQW/CLKIN pin are derived \nfrom the uncorrected oscillator, while the 1Hz output is \nderived from the adjusted Osc-1Hz signal.\nConceptually, the circuit can be thought of as two 1Hz \nsignals, one derived from the internal oscillator and \nthe other from the external reference clock, with the \noscillator-derived 1Hz signal being locked to the 1Hz signal derived from the external reference clock. The \nedges of the 1Hz signals do not need to be aligned with \neach other. While the external clock source is present \nand within tolerance, the Ext-1Hz and Osc-1Hz maintain \ntheir existing lock, regardless of their edge alignment, \nwith periodic correction of the Osc-1Hz signal. If the \nexternal signal is lost and then regained sometime later, \nthe signals re-lock with whatever new alignment exists \n(Figure 4 ).\nThe Ext-1Hz is used by the device as long as it is within \ntolerance, which is about 0.8% of Osc-1Hz. While Ext-1Hz \nis within tolerance, the skew between the two signals may \nshift until a change of about 7.8ms accumulates, after \nwhich Osc-1Hz signal is adjusted ( Figure 5 ). The adjust -\nment is accomplished by digitally adjusting the 32kHz \noscillator divider chain.\nFigure 4. Loss and Reacquisition of External Reference Clock\nFigure 5.

The first byte \nsent to the device includes the device identifier and the \nR/W bit ( Figure 6 ). The device address sent by the I 2C \nmaster must match the address assigned to the device.\nI2C Definitions\nThe following terminology is commonly used to describe \nI2C data transfers.\n Master Device:  The master device controls the slave \ndevices on the bus. The master device generates SCL \nclock pulses and START and STOP conditions.\n Slave Devices:  Slave devices send and receive data \nat the master’s request.\n Bus Idle or Not Busy:  Time between STOP and \nSTART conditions when both SDA and SCL are inac -\ntive and in their logic-high states. When the bus is idle \nit often initiates a low-power mode for slave devices.\n START Condition:  A START condition is generated \nby the master to initiate a new data transfer with a \nslave. Transitioning SDA from high to low while SCL \nremains high generates a START condition. See \nFigure 1  for applicable timing.\n STOP Condition:  A STOP condition is generated \nby the master to end a data transfer with a slave. \nTransitioning SDA from low to high while SCL remains \nhigh generates a STOP condition. See Figure 1  for \napplicable timing.\n Repeated START Condition:  The master can use \na repeated START condition at the end of one data transfer to indicate that it immediately initiates a new \ndata transfer following the current one. Repeated \nSTARTs are commonly used during read operations \nto identify a specific memory address to begin a data \ntransfer. A repeated START condition is issued identi -\ncally to a normal START condition. See Figure 1  for \napplicable timing.\n Bit Write:  Transitions of SDA must occur during the low \nstate of SCL. The data on SDA must remain valid and \nunchanged during the entire high pulse of SCL plus the \nsetup and hold time requirements ( Figure 1 ). Data is \nshifted into the device during the rising edge of the SCL.\n Bit Read:  At the end a write operation, the master \nmust release the SDA bus line for the proper amount \nof setup time before the next rising edge of SCL dur -\ning a bit read ( Figure 1 ). The device shifts out each \nbit of data on SDA at the falling edge of the previous \nSCL pulse and the data bit is valid at the rising edge \nof the current SCL pulse. Remember that the master \ngenerates all SCL clock pulses including when it is \nreading bits from the slave.\n Acknowledge (ACK and NACK):  An acknowledge \n(ACK) or not-acknowledge (NACK) is always the 9th \nbit transmitted during a byte transfer. The device \nreceiving data (the master during a read or the slave \nduring a write operation) performs an ACK by trans -\nmitting a zero during the 9th bit. A device performs \na NACK by transmitting a one during the 9th bit. \nTiming for the ACK and NACK is identical to all other \nbit writes. An ACK is the acknowledgment that the \ndevice is properly receiving data. A NACK is used to \nterminate a read sequence or as an indication that the \ndevice is not receiving data.\n Byte Write:  A byte write consists of 8 bits of informa -\ntion transferred from the master to the slave (most \nsignificant bit first) plus a 1-bit acknowledgment from \nthe slave to the master. The 8 bits transmitted by the \nmaster are done according to the bit write definition \nand the acknowledgment is read using the bit read \ndefinition.\n Byte Read:  A byte read is an 8-bit information transfer \nfrom the slave to the master plus a 1-bit ACK or NACK \nfrom the master to the slave. The 8 bits of information \nthat are transferred (most significant bit first) from the \nslave to the master are read by the master using the \nbit read definition, and the master transmits an ACK \nusing the bit write definition to receive additional data Figure 6. Slave Address Byte\nDS1308 Low-Current I 2C RTC with 56-Byte NV RAM\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 1311 1 0R /W 0 0 0MSB LSB\nREAD/\nWRITE BITDEVICE\nIDENTIFIER\nbytes. The master must NACK the last byte read to \nterminate communication so the slave returns control \nof SDA to the master.\n Slave Address Byte:  Each slave on the I 2C bus \nresponds to a slave address byte sent immediately \nfollowing a START condition. The slave address byte \ncontains the slave address in the most significant 7 \nbits and the R/ W bit in the least significant bit. The \nslave address is D0h and cannot be modified by the \nuser. When the R/ W bit is 0 (such as in D0h), the mas -\nter is indicating it writes data to the slave. If R/ W = 1, \n(D1h in this case), the master is indicating it wants \nto read from the slave. If an incorrect slave address \nis written, the DS1308 assumes the master is com -\nmunicating with another I 2C device and ignores the \ncommunication until the next START condition is sent.\n Memory Address:  During an I 2C write operation, the \nmaster must transmit a memory address to identify \nthe memory location where the slave is to store the \ndata. The memory address is always the second byte \ntransmitted during a write operation following the \nslave address byte.I2C Communication\n Writing a Single Byte to a Slave:  The master must \ngenerate a START condition, write the slave address \nbyte (R/ W = 0), write the memory address, write \nthe byte of data, and generate a STOP condition. \nRemember the master must read the slave’s acknowl -\nedgment during all byte write operations.\n Writing Multiple Bytes to a Slave:  To write multiple \nbytes to a slave, the master generates a START condi -\ntion, writes the slave address byte (R/ W = 0), writes \nthe starting memory address, writes multiple data \nbytes, and generates a STOP condition.\n Reading a Single Byte from a Slave:  Unlike the \nwrite operation that uses the specified memory \naddress byte to define where the data is to be \nwritten, the read operation occurs at the present \nvalue of the memory address counter. To read a \nsingle byte from the slave, the master generates \na START condition, writes the slave address byte \nwith R/ W\xa0= 1, reads the data byte with a NACK to \nindicate the end of the transfer, and generates a \nSTOP condition. However, since requiring the mas -\nter to keep track of the memory address counter is \nFigure 7.

To do this the mas -\nter generates a START condition, writes the slave \naddress byte (R/ W = 0), writes the memory address \nwhere it desires to read, generates a repeated START \ncondition, writes the slave address byte (R/ W = 1), \nreads data with ACK or NACK as applicable, and \ngenerates a STOP condition. See Figure 7  for a read \nexample using the repeated START condition to \nspecify the starting memory location.\n Reading Multiple Bytes From a Slave:  The read \noperation can be used to read multiple bytes with a \nsingle transfer. When reading bytes from the slave, \nthe master simply ACKs the data byte if it desires to \nread another byte before terminating the transaction. \nAfter the master reads the last byte it must NACK to \nindicate the end of the transfer and then it generates \na STOP condition.\nBus Timeout\nTo avoid an unintended I 2C interface timeout, SCL \nshould not be held low longer than t TIMEOUTMIN . The \nI2C interface is in the reset state and can receive a \nnew START condition when SCL is held low for at least \ntTIMEOUTMAX . When the part detects this condition, SDA \nis released and allowed to float. For the timeout function to \nwork, the oscillator must be enabled and running.\nApplications Information\nPower-Supply Decoupling\nTo achieve the best results when using the DS1308, \ndecouple the V CC power supply with a 0.01 FF and/or \n0.1FF capacitor. Use a high-quality, ceramic, surface-\nmount capacitor if possible. Surface-mount components \nminimize lead inductance, which improves performance, \nand ceramic capacitors tend to have adequate high-\nfrequency response for decoupling applications.\nUsing Open-Drain Outputs\nThe SQW/CLKIN output is open drain and therefore \nrequires an external pullup resistor to realize a logic-high \noutput level.\nSDA and SCL Pullup Resistors\nSDA is an open-drain output and requires an external \npullup resistor to realize a logic-high output level.Because the DS1308 does not use clock cycle stretch -\ning, a master using either an open-drain output with a \npullup resistor or CMOS output driver (push-pull) could \nbe used for SCL.\nBattery Charge Protection\nThe DS1308 contains Maxim’s redundant battery-charge \nprotection circuit to prevent any charging of an exter -\nnal battery. The DS1308 is recognized by Underwriters \nLaboratories (UL) under file E141114.\nHandling, PCB Layout, and Assembly\nAvoid running signal traces under the package, unless \na ground plane is placed between the package and the \nsignal line.\nThe lead(Pb)-free/RoHS package can be soldered using \na reflow profile that complies with JEDEC J-STD-020.\nMoisture-sensitive packages are shipped from the fac -\ntory dry-packed. Handling instructions listed on the pack -\nage label must be followed to prevent damage during \nreflow.
