An I2C/serial peripheral \ninterface  (SPI) control port is included that allow s a microcontroller  \nto adjust volume and many other parameters. The ADAU1978 \nuses only a single 3 .3 V supply . The part internally generates the \nrequ ired digital DVDD supply . The low power architecture \nreduces the power consumption. The  ADAU1978 is available in \na 40-lead LFCSP package. The o n-chip PLL can derive the master  \nclock from an external c lock input or frame clock (sample  rate \nclock). When fed with the frame clock , it eliminates the need \nfor a separate high frequency master clock in the s ystem .  \nNote that throughout this data sheet, multifunction pins, such \nas SCL/CCLK, are referred to either by the entire pin name or by a single function of the pin, for example, CCLK, when only \nthat function is relevant.  \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \n \nFigure 1.  \n AVDD2\nBG\nREF\nPROGRAMMABLE GAIN\nDECIMATOR/HPF\nDC CALIBRATION\nSERIAL AUDIO PORTVREF\nMCLKIN\nPLL_FILTAVDD1\nAVDD3\nAVDD2DGNDAGND3AGND2AGND1\nAGND6AGND5AGND4\nSA_MODEPLL\nAGND2DVDD\nIOVDD\nLRCLK\nBCLK\nSDATAOUT1\nSDATAOUT23.3V TO 1.8V\nREGULATORADAU1978\n11292-001SCL/CCLK\nSDA/COUT\nADDR1/CIN\nADDR0/CLATCH\nPD/RSTI2C/SPI\nCONTROLAGND1\nAGND2AGND3AIN1P\nAIN1N\nAIN2P\nAIN2N\nAIN3P\nAIN3N\nAIN4P\nAIN4NADC\nADC\nADC\nADC\nAVDD1\nAVDD3\nADAU1978 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

A | Page 12 of 44 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nOVERVIEW  \nThe ADAU1978 incorporates four high performance ADCs and \na phase -locked loop circuit for generating the necessary on -chip \nclock signals.  \nPOWER SUPPLY AND VOL TAGE REFERENCE  \nThe ADAU1978 requires a single 3.3 V power supply. Separate \npower supply input pins are provided for the analog and boost \nconverter. Decouple t hese pins to AGND with 100 nF ceramic \nchip capacitors placed as close as possible to the pins to minimize \nnoise pickup. A bul k aluminum electrolytic capacitor of at least \n10 μF must be provided on the same PCB as the ADC. It is \nimportant that the analog supply be as clean as possible for \nbest performance.  \nThe supply voltage for the digital core (DVDD) is generated \nusing an inter nal low dropout regulator. The typical DVDD \noutput is 1.8 V and must be decoupled using a 100 nF ceramic \ncapacitor and a 10 µF capacitor. Place the 100 nF ceramic \ncapacitor as close as possible to the DVDD pin.  \nThe voltage reference for the analog blocks i s generated \ninternally and output at the VREF pin (Pin 2). The typical voltage at the pin is 1.5 V with an AVDDx of 3.3 V .  \nAll digital inputs are compatible with TTL and CMOS levels. \nAll outputs are driven from the IOVDD supply. The IOVDD can be in the 1.8  V to 3.3 V  range . The IOVDD pin must be \ndecoupled with a 100 nF capacitor placed as close to the \nIOVDD pin as possible.  \nThe ADC internal voltage reference is output from the VREF pin  \nand must  be decoupled using a 100 nF ceramic capacitor in \nparallel with a 10 µ F capacitor. The VREF pin has limited current \ncapability. The voltage reference is used as a reference to the \nADC; therefore, it is recommended not to draw current from \nthis pin for external circuits. When using this reference, use a \nnoninverting amp lifier buffer to provide a reference to other \ncircuits in the application.  \nIn reset mode, the VREF pin is disabled to save power and is \nenabled only when the \nRST  pin is pulled high.  \nPOWER -ON RESET SEQUENCE  \nThe ADAU1978 requires that a single 3.3 V power supply be \nprovided externally at the AVDDx pin. The part internally \ngenerates DVDD (1.8 V), which is used for the digital core of the ADC. The DVDD supply output pin (Pin 10) i s provided \nto connect the decoupling capacitors to DGND. The typical \nrecommended values for the decoupling capacitors are 100 nF \nin parallel with 10 µF. During a reset, the DVDD regulator is \ndisabled to reduce power consumption. After the \nPD/RST  pin \n(Pin 6) is pulled high, the part enables the DVDD regulator. \nHowever, the internal ADC and digital core reset is controlled by  \nthe internal POR  signal (power -on reset) circuit, which monitors \nthe DVDD level. Therefore, the device does not come out of a reset until DVDD reaches 1.2 V and the POR  signal is released. \nThe DVDD settling time depends on the charge -up time for the \nexternal capacitors and on the AVDDx ramp -up time.  \nThe internal powe r-on reset circuit is provided with hysteresis  to \nensure that a reset of the part is not initiated by an  instantaneous \nglitch on DVDD. The typical trip points are 1.2 V with PD/RST  \nhigh and 0.6  V (±20%) with PD/RST  low. This ensures that  \nthe core is not reset until the DVDD level falls below the 0.6 V \ntrip point.  \nAs soon as the PD/RST  pin is pulled high, the internal regulator \nstarts charging up C EXT on the DVDD pin. The DVDD  charge -up \ntime is based on the output resistance of the regulator and the \nexternal decoupling capacitor. The time constant can be calcu -\nlated as  \ntC = ROUT × CEXT  \nwhere ROUT = 20 Ω typical . \nFor example, if C EXT is 10 µF, t C is 200 µs and is the time that it \ntakes to reach the DVDD voltage, within 63.6%.  \nThe power -on reset circuit releases an internal reset of the core \nwhen DVDD  reaches 1.2 V (see Figure 13). Therefore, it is \nrecommended to wait for at least the t C period to elapse before \nsending I2C or SPI control signals. \n \nFigure 13. Power -On Reset Timing  \nWhen applying a hardware reset to the part by pulling the  \nPD/RST  pin (Pin 6) low and then high, there are certain time \nrestrictions. During the PD/RST  low pulse period, the DVDD \nstart s discharging. The discharge time constant is decided on by \nthe internal resistance of the regulator and C EXT. The time \nrequired for DVDD to fall from 1.8 V to 0.48 V (0.6 V − 20%) \ncan be estimated using the following equation:  \ntD = 1.32 × R INT × CEXT \nwher e RINT = 64 kΩ typical. (R INT can vary due to process by ±20%.)  \nFor example, if C EXT is 10 µF, t D is 0.845 sec.  \nDepending on C EXT, tD may vary and , in turn, affect  the mini -\nmum hold period for the PD/RST  pulse.

A | Page 13 of 44 must be held low for the t D time period to initialize the core \nproperly.  \nThe required PD/RST  low pulse period can be reduced by \nadding a resistor across C EXT. The new t D value can then be \ncalculated as  \ntD = 1.32 × R EQ × CEXT \nwhere REQ = 64 kΩ || R EXT. \nThe resistor ensures that DVDD not only discharges quickly during \na reset or an AVDDx power loss but also resets the internal blocks correctly. Note that some power loss in  this resistor is to be \nexpected because the resistor constantly draws current from DVDD. The typical value for C\nEXT is 10 µF and for R EXT is 3 kΩ. \nThis results in a time constant of  \ntD = 1.32 × R EQ × CEXT = 37.8 ms  \nwhere REQ = 2.866 kΩ (64 kΩ || 3 kΩ).  \nUsing this equation at a set C EXT value, the R EXT can be calculated  \nfor a desired PD/RST  pulse period.   \nThere is also a software reset bit  (S_RST, Bit 7 of Register 0x00) \navailable that can be used to reset the part, but note that during  an \nAVDDx power loss, the software reset may not ensure proper initialization because DVDD may not be stable.  \n \nFigure 14. DVDD Regulator Output Connections  \nPLL AND CLOCK  \nThe ADAU1978 has a built -in analog PLL to provide a jitter -free \nmaster clock to the internal ADC. The PLL must be programmed  \nfor the appropriate input clock frequency. The PLL _CONTROL  \nRegister 0x01 is used for setting the PLL.  \nThe CLK_S bit (Bit 4) of Register 0x01 is used for setting the \nclock source for the PLL. The clock source can be either the \nMCLKIN pin or the LRCLK pin (slave mode). In LRCLK mode, \nthe PLL can support sample rates between 32 k Hz and 192 kHz.  \nIn MCLK input mode, the MCS bits (Bits[2:0] of Register 0x01) \nmust be set to the desired input clock frequency for the MCLKIN  \npin. Table 9 shows the i nput master clock frequency  required \nfor the most common sample rates and the MCS bit settings.  The PLL_LOCK bit (Bit 7) of Register 0x01 indicates the lock status of the PLL. It is recommended that after initial power -up \nthe PLL lock status be read to en sure that the PLL outputs the \ncorrect frequency before unmuting the audio outputs.  \nTable 9.

A lock bit  \nis provided that can be polled via the I\n2C to check whether the \nPLL has acquired lock.  \nThe PLL requires an external filter, which is connected at the PLL_FILT pin (Pin 3). The recommended PLL filter circuit for \nMCLK or LRCLK mode is shown in Figure 15. Using NPO \ncapacitors is recommended for temperature stability. Place the \nfilter components close to the device for best performance.  \n \nFigure 15.

The ADCs \ncan accommodate both dc - and ac -coupled input signals.  \nThe block diagram shown in Figure 16 represents the typical \ninput circuit.  \nIn most audio applications, the dc content of the signal is removed  \nby using a coupling capacitor. However, the ADAU1978 consists \nof a unique input structure that allows ac coupling of the input \nsignal s. The typical input resistance is approximately 14 kΩ \nfrom each input to AGND.  \nThe high -pass filter has a 1.4  Hz, 6  dB per octave cutoff at a \n48 kHz sample rate. The cutoff frequency scales directly with \nthe sample frequency. However, care is required in dc -coupled \napplications to ensure that the common -mode dc voltage does \nnot excee d the specified limit. The input required for the full -\nscale ADC output (0 dBFS) is typically  2 V rms differential.   \nFigure 16.

A | Page 15 of 44 Line Inputs  \nThis section describes some of the possible ways to connect the \nline level inputs of the ADAU1978. \nLine Input Balanced or Differential Input DC -Coupled Case  \nFor example , for an input signal of 2  V rms differential with \napproximately  1.5 V common -mode dc, t he signal at each input \npin has a  1 V rms or 2.8  V p-p signal swing. With common -mode  \ndc of 1.5 V , the signal c an swing between (1.5  V + 1.414 V) = \n2.914  V to (1.5 V − 1.414 V) = 0.086  V at each input . Therefore, \nthis is approximately  5.6 V p-p differential across AINxP and  \nAINxN and measure s close to 0  dBFS ( ac only with a dc high -\npass filter) at the ADC output (s ee Figure 17).  \nLine Input Balanced or Differential Input AC -Coupled Case  \nFor connecting  the ADAU1978 to a head  unit amplifier output , \nac coupling is recommended. In this case , the AINxP/AINxN \npins are at a common -mode level of 1.5  V . The attenuator c an \nbe used to reduce the input level if it is more than 2  V rms.  The C1 and C2 values c an be found for the required low \nfrequency cutoff using t he following equation : \nC1 or C2 = 1/(2  × π × fC × Input Resistance)  \nwhere the Input Resistance  of the ADAU1978 is 14.3 kΩ typical. \nRefer to Figure 18 for information about connecting the line \nlevel inputs to the ADAU1978.  \nLine Input Unbalanced or Single -Ended , Pseudo Differen tial \nAC-Coupled Case  \nFor a single -ended application, reduce the signal swing by half \nbecause  only one input is used for the signal with the other con -\nnected to 0  V.  Doing t his reduces the input signal capability to \n1 V rms in the single -ended application and measure s approxi -\nmately  −6.16 dBFS ( ac only with a dc  high -pass filter) at the \nADC output.  \nSee Figure 19 for additional information.

A | Page 16 of 44 ADC  \nThe ADAU1978 contains four sigma -delta (Σ-Δ) ADC channels \nconfigured as two stereo pairs with configurable differential/ \nsingle -ended inputs. The ADC can operate at a nominal sample \nrate of 32  kHz up to 192 kHz. The ADCs include on -board \ndigital antialiasing filters with 79 dB stop -band attenuation and \nlinear phase response.  Digital outputs are supplied through two \nserial data output pins (one for each stereo pair) and a common frame clock (LRCLK) and bit clock (BCLK). Alternatively, one of the TDM modes can be used to support up to 16 channels on \na single TDM data line.  \nWith  smaller amplitude input signals, a 10 -bit programmable \ndigital gain compensation for an individual channel is provided \nto scale up the output word to full scale. Take care to avoid \novercompensation (large gain compensation), which leads to \nclipping and TH D degradation in the ADC.  \nThe ADCs also have a dc offset calibration algorithm to null the \nsystematic dc offset of the ADC. This feature is useful for dc \nmeasurement applications.  \nADC SUMMING MODES  \nThe four ADCs can be grouped into either a single stereo ADC \nor a single mono ADC to increase the SNR  for the application. \nTwo options are available: one option for summing two channels   \nof the ADC and another option for summing all four channels \nof the ADC. Summing is performed in the digital block.  \n2-Channel S umming Mode  \nWhen the SUM_MODE b its (Bits[7:6] of Register 0x0E) are set \nto 01, the Channel 1 and Channel 2 ADC data are combined \nand output from the SDATAOUT1 pin. Similarly, the Channel 3  \nand Channel 4 ADC data are combined and output from the \nSDATAOUT2 p in. As a result, the SNR improves by 3 dB. For this \nmode, both Channel 1 and Channel 2 must be connected to the \nsame input signal source. Similarly, Channel 3 and Channel  4 \nmust be connected to the same input signal source.   \nFigure 20. 2-Channel Summing Mode Connection Diagram  \n4-Channel Summing Mode  \nWhen the SUM_MODE Bits (Bits[7:6] of Register 0x0E) are set \nto 10, the Channel 1 through Channel 4 ADC data are combined \nand output from the SDATAOUT1 pin. As a result, the SNR improves  by 6 dB. For this mode, all four channels must be \nconnected to the same input signal source.  \n \nFigure 21. 4-Channel Summing Mode Connection Diagram  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n11292 -019OPTION B: DIFFERENTIAL AC-COUPLED\nC1VDIFF = 2V rms\nC2AIN1P\nAIN1N\nAIN2P\nAIN2NTYPICAL STEREO\nOUTPUT\nΣ\nC3\nC4AIN3PAIN3N\nAIN4PAIN4NΣ\n11292 -020OPTION B: DIFFERENTIAL AC-COUPLED\nC1VDIFF = 2V rms\nC2AIN1P\nAIN1N\nAIN2P\nAIN2NTYPICAL STEREO\nOUTPUT\nAIN3P\nAIN3N\nAIN4P\nAIN4NΣ\nData Sheet ADAU1978 \n \nRev.

The TDM slot width, data width, and \nchannel assignment, as well as the pin used to output the data, \nare programmable.  \nBy default, serial data is output on the SDATAOUT1 pin; \nhow ever, the SDATA_SEL bit (Bit 7 of Register 0x06) can be \nused to change the setting so that serial data is output from the \nSDATAOUT2 pin.  \nThe TDM mode supports two , four, eight , or 16 channels. The \nADAU1978 outputs four channels of data in the assigned slots (Figure 27 shows the TDM mode  slot assignmen ts). During the \nunused slots, the output pin becomes  high -Z so that the same \ndata line can be shared with other devices on the TDM bus.  \nThe TDM port can be operated as either a master or a slave.  \nIn master mode, the BCLK and LRCLK are output from the \nADAU1978, whereas in slave mode, the BCLK and LRCLK pins \nare set to receive the clock from the master in the system.  \nBoth the nonpulse and pulse modes are supported. In nonpulse \nmode, the LRCLK signal is typically 50% of the duty cycle, whereas  \nin pulse mode, the LRCLK signal must be at least one BCLK wide  \n(see Figure 25 and Figure 26). \n \n \nFigure 25.

A | Page 21 of 44 CONTROL PORTS  \nThe ADAU1978 control port allows two modes of operation , \neither 2 -wire I2C mode or 4 -wire SPI mode, that are used for \nsetting the internal registers of the part. Both the I2C and SPI \nmodes allow read and write capability of the registers. All the \nregisters are eight bi ts wide. The registers start at Address 0x00 \nand end at Address 0x1A.  \nThe control port in both I2C and SPI modes is slave only and, \ntherefore, requires the master in the system to operate. The \nregisters can be accessed with or without the master clock to the part. However, to operate the PLL, serial audio ports, and \nboost converter, the master clock is necessary.  \nBy default, the ADAU1978 operates in I2C mode,  but the part can \nbe put into SPI mode by  pulling the CLATCH  pin low three times . \nThe control port pins are multifunctional, depending on the mode in which the part is operating. Table 11 describes the \ncontrol port pin functions in both modes.  \n \nTable 11.

A | Page 22 of 44 I2C MODE \nThe ADAU1978 supports a 2 -wire serial (I2C-compatible) bus \nprotocol. Two pins , serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL) , are \nused to communicate with the  system I2C master controller. In \nI2C mode, the ADAU1978 is always a slave on the bus, meaning  \nthat it cannot initiate a data transfer. Each slave device on the \nI2C bus is recognized by a uniq ue device address. The device \naddress and R/ W byte for the ADAU1978 are shown in  Table 12. \nThe address resides in the first seven bits of the I2C write. Bit 7 \nand Bit 6 of the I2C address for the ADAU1978 are set by t he \nlevels on the ADDR1 and ADDR0 pins. The LSB of the first I2C \nbyte (the R/ W bit) from the master identifies whether it is a read \nor write operation. Logic Level 1 in the LSB (Bit 0) corresponds \nto a read operation, and Logic Level 0 corresponds to a write operation.  \nTable 12. I\n2C First Byte Format \nBit 7  Bit 6  Bit 5  Bit 4  Bit 3  Bit 2  Bit 1  Bit 0  \nADDR1  ADDR0  1 0 0 0 1 R/W \n \nThe first seven bits of the I2C chip address for the ADAU1978 \nare xx10001. Bit 7 and Bit 6  of the address byte can be set using \nthe ADDR1 and ADDR0 pins to set the chip address to the \ndesired value.  \nThe 7 -bit I2C device address can be set to one of four of the \nfollowing possible options using the ADDR1 and ADDR0 pins:  \n• I2C Device Address 0010001 (0x11)  \n• I2C Device Address 0110001 (0x31)  \n• I2C Device Address 1010001 (0x51)  \n• I2C Device Address 1110001 (0x71)  \nIn I2C mode, both the SDA and SCL pins requir e that an \nappropriate pull -up resistor be connected to IOVDD. Ensure \nthat t he voltage on these signal lines does not exceed the voltage \non the IOVDD  pin. Figure 44 shows a typical connection \ndiagram for the I2C mode.  \nThe value of the pull -up resistor for the SDA or SCL pin can be \ncalculated as follows.  \nMinimum R PULL UP  = (IOVDD − VIL)/ISINK \nwhere:  \nIOVDD  is the I/O supply voltage, typically ranging from 1.8 V \nup to 3. 3 V. \nVIL is the maximum voltage at Logic Level 0 (that is, 0.4 V , as \nper the I2C specifications).  \nISINK is the current sink capability of the I/O pin.  The SDA pin can sink 2 mA  of current; therefore,  the minimum \nvalue of R PULL UP  for an IOVDD of 3.3 V is 1.5 kΩ.  \nDepending on the capacitance of the board, the speed of the bus can be restricted to meet the rise time and fall time specifications.  \nFor fast mode with a bit rate time of around 1 Mbps, the rise \ntime must be less than 550 ns. Use the following e quation to \ndetermine whether the rise time specification can be met:  \nt = 0.8473 × R\nPULL UP  × CBOARD  \nwhere CBOARD  must be less than 236  pF to meet the 300 ns rise \ntime requirement . \nFor the SCL pin, the calculations depend on the current sink \ncapability of t he I2C master used in the system.  \nAddressing  \nInitially, each device on the I2C bus is in an idle state and monitors  \nthe SDA and SCL lines for a start condition and the proper address.  \nThe I2C master initiates a data transfer by establishing a start \ncondition, defined by a high -to-low transition on SDA while \nSCL remains high. This indicates that an address/data stream \nfollows. All devices on the bus respond to the start condition and acquire t he next eight bits from the master (the 7 -bit address  \nplus the R/\nW bit) MSB first. The master sends the 7 -bit device \naddress with the R/W bit to all the slaves on the bus. The device \nwith the matching address r esponds by pulling the data line \n(SDA) low during the ninth clock pulse. This ninth bit is known \nas an acknowledge bit. All other devices withdraw from the bus \nat this point and return to the idle condition.  \nThe R/ W bit determines th e direction of the data. A Logic 0 on  the \nLSB of the first byte means that the master is to write information  \nto the slave, whereas a Logic 1 means that the master is to read \ninformation from the slave after writing the address and repeating  \nthe start addr ess. A data transfer takes place until a master initiates  \na stop condition. A stop condition occurs when SDA transitions \nfrom low to high while SCL is held high.  \nStop and start conditions can be detect ed at any stage during the  \ndata transfer. If these cond itions are asserted out of sequence \nduring normal read and write operations, the ADAU1978 \nimmediately jumps to the idle condition.  \nFigure 33 and Figure 34 use the following abbreviations:  \nACK = acknowledge  \nNo ACK = no acknowledge  \n \n \nData Sheet ADAU1978 \n \nRev.

A | Page 24 of 44 I2C Read and Write Operations  \nFigure 35 shows the format of a single -word I2C write \noperation. Every ninth clock pulse, the ADAU1978 issues an \nacknowledge by pulling S DA low.  \nFigure 36 shows the format of a burst mode write sequence. This  \nfigure shows an example of a write to sequential single -byte \nregisters. The ADAU1978 increments its address register after \nevery byte because the requested address corresponds to a \nregister or memory area with a 1 -byte word length.  \nFigure 37 shows the format of a single -word I2C read operation. \nNote  that the first R/ W bit is 0, indicating a write operation. \nThis is because the address still needs to be written to set up the \ninternal  address. After the ADAU1978 acknowledges the receipt \nof the address, the master must issue a repeated start command  followed by the chip address byte with the R/ W bit set to 1 \n(read). This causes the ADAU1978 SDA to reverse and begin \ndriving data back to the master. The master then responds every \nninth pulse with an acknowledge pulse to the ADAU1978.  \nFigure 38 shows the format of a burst mode read sequence. This \nfigure shows an example of a read from  sequential single -byte \nregisters. The ADAU1978 increments its address registers after \nevery byte because the ADAU1978 uses an 8 -bit register address.  \nFigure 35 to Figure 38 use the following abbreviations:  \nS = start bit  \nP = stop bit  \nAM = acknowledge by master  \nAS = acknowledge by slave  \n \n \nFigure 35.

This can be done by  perform -\ning three dummy writes to the SPI port (the ADAU1978 does not \nacknowledge these three writes , see Figure 39). Beginning  with the \nfourth SPI write, data can be written to or read from the device. \nThe ADAU1978 can be taken out of SPI mode only by a full \nreset initiated by power cycling the device.  \nThe SPI port uses a 4 -wire interface, consisting of the CLATCH , \nCCLK, CIN, and COUT signals, and it is always a slave port. \nThe CLAT CH signal  goes low at the beginning of a transaction \nand high at the end of a transaction. The CCLK signal latches \nCOUT  on a low -to-high transition. COUT data is shifted out of \nthe ADAU1978  on the falling edge of CCLK and is  clocked into \na receiving device, such as a microcontroller, on the CCLK \nrising edge. The C IN signal carries the serial input data, and the  \nCOUT signal carries the serial output data. The COUT signal remains tristated un til a read operation is requested. This allows \ndirect connection to other SPI -compatible peripheral COUT ports \nfor sharing the same system controller port. All SPI transactions have the same basic generic control word format, as shown in \nTable 15. A timing diagram is shown in Figure 3. Write a ll data \nMSB first.  \nChip Address R/ W \nThe LSB of the first byte of an SPI transaction is a R/ W bit. This bit  \ndetermines whether the communication is a read (Logic Level 1) \nor a write (Logic Level 0). This format is shown in  Table 13. \nTable 13.

This address is the location of the appropriate register.  \nData Bytes  \nThe number of data bytes varies according to the register being \naccessed. During a burs t mode write, an initial register address is  \nwritten followed by a continuous sequence of data for consecutive  \nregister locations.  \nA sample timing diagram for a single -word SPI write operation \nto a register is shown in Figure 40. A sample timing diagram of \na single -word SPI read operation is shown in  Figure 41. The \nCOUT pin goes from being high -Z to being driven at the \nbeginning of Byte  3. In this example, Byte 0 to Byte 1 contain \nthe device address, the R/ W bit, and the register address to be \nread. Subsequent bytes carry the data from the device.  \nStandalone  Mode  \nThe ADAU1978 can also operate in standalone mode. However, \nin standalone mode, the boost converter, microphone bias, and \ndiagnostics blocks are powered down. To set the part in standalone  \nmode, pull the SA_MODE pin to IOVDD. In this mode, some \npins change functionality to provide more flexibility  (see Table 14 \nfor more information).  \nTable 14.
