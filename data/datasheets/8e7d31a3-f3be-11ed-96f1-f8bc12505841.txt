The device can be configured in several standard switching-regulator topologies, including boost, SEPIC, \nand isolated flyback. The device has a wide input voltage range to support applications with input voltage from \nmulticell batteries or regulated 3.3-V, 5-V, 12-V, and 24-V power rails.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nSW\nRamp\nGeneratorLossless\nCurrent SenseEN\nPGNDError\nAmpVIN\nPWM\nControlCOMP\nSS FREQ SYNCFB\nAGND1.229V\nReference\n/c83\nOscillatorGate\nDriver\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Operation\nIf designed as a boost converter, the TPS55340 device regulates the output with current-mode, pulse-width-\nmodulation (PWM) control. The PWM control circuitry turns on the switch at the beginning of each oscillator \nclock cycle. The input voltage is applied across the inductor and stores the energy as inductor current ramps up. \nDuring this portion of the switching cycle, the load current is provided by the output capacitor. When the inductor \ncurrent reaches a threshold level set by the error amplifier output, the power switch turns off and the external \nSchottky diode is forward biased to allow the inductor current to flow to the output. The inductor transfers stored \nenergy to replenish the output capacitor and supply the load current. This operation repeats every switching \ncycle. The duty cycle of the converter is determined by the PWM control comparator which compares the \nerror amplifier output and the current signal. The oscillator frequency is programmed by the external resistor or \nsynchronized to an external clock signal.\nA ramp signal from the oscillator is added to the inductor current ramp to provide slope compensation. Slope \ncompensation is required to avoid subharmonic oscillation that is intrinsic to peak-current mode control at duty \ncycles higher than 50%. If the inductor value is too small, the internal slope compensation may not be adequate \nto maintain stability.www.ti.comTPS55340\nSLVSBD4E – MAY 2012 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS55340\nThe PWM control feedback loop regulates the FB pin to a reference voltage through a transconductance error \namplifier. The output of the error amplifier is connected to the COMP pin. An external RC compensation network \nconnected to the COMP pin is chosen for feedback loop stability and optimum transient response.\n7.3.2 Switching Frequency\nThe switching frequency is set by a resistor (R FREQ) connected to the FREQ pin of the TPS55340. The \nrelationship between the timing resistance R FREQ and frequency is shown in the Figure 6-5 . Do not leave this pin \nopen. A resistor must always be connected from the FREQ pin to ground for proper operation. The resistor value \nrequired for a desired frequency can be calculated using Equation 1 .\nRFREQ(kΩ) = 57500 × ƒ sw(kHz)–1.03(1)\nFor the given resistor value, the corresponding frequency can be calculated by Equation 2 .\nƒsw(kHz) = 41600 × R FREQ(kΩ)–0.97(2)\nThe TPS55340 switching frequency can be synchronized to an external clock signal that is applied to the SYNC \npin. The required logic levels of the external clock are shown in Section 6.3. The recommended duty cycle of \nthe clock is in the range of 10% to 90%. A resistor must be connected from the FREQ pin to ground when the \nconverter is synchronized to the external clock and the external clock frequency must be within ±20% of the \ncorresponding frequency set by the resistor. For example, if the frequency programmed by the FREQ pin resistor \nis 600 kHz, the external clock signal should be in the range of 480 kHz to 720 kHz.\nWith a switching frequency below 280 kHz (typical) after the TPS55340 enters frequency foldback as described \nin Section 7.3.3 , if a load remains when the overcurrent condition is removed, then the output may not recover to \nthe set value. For the output to return to the set value, the load must be removed completely or the TPS55340 \npower cycled with the EN pin or VIN pin. Select a nominal switching frequency of 350 kHz for quicker recovery \nfrom frequency foldback.\n7.3.3 Overcurrent Protection and Frequency Foldback\nThe TPS55340 provides cycle-by-cycle overcurrent protection that turns off the power switch once the inductor \ncurrent reaches the overcurrent limit threshold. The PWM circuitry resets itself at the beginning of the next \nswitch cycle. During an overcurrent event, the output voltage begins to drop as a function of the load on the \noutput. When the FB voltage through the feedback resistors drops lower than 0.9 V, the switching frequency is \nautomatically reduced to 1/4 of the normal value. Figure 6-8  shows the nonfoldback frequency with an 80-k Ω \ntiming resistor and the corresponding foldback frequency. The switching frequency does not return to normal \nuntil the overcurrent condition is removed and the FB voltage increases above 0.9 V. The frequency foldback \nfeature is disabled during soft-start.\n7.3.3.1 Minimum On-Time and Pulse Skipping\nThe TPS55340 PWM control system has a minimum PWM pulse width of 77 ns (typical). This minimum on-time \ndetermines the minimum duty cycle of the PWM for any set switching frequency. When the voltage regulation \nloop of the TPS55340 requires a minimum on-time pulse width less than 77 ns, the IC enters pulse skipping \nmode. In this mode, the device will hold the power switch off for several switching cycles to prevent the output \nvoltage from rising above the desired regulated voltage. This operation typically occurs in light load conditions \nwhen the PWM operates in discontinuous conduction mode. Pulse skipping increases the output ripple as shown \nin Figure 8-7 .\n7.3.4 Voltage Reference and Setting Output Voltage\nAn internal voltage reference provides a precise 1.229-V voltage reference at the error amplifier noninverting \ninput. To set the output voltage, select the FB pin resistor R SH and R SL according to Equation 3 .\nSH\nOUT\nSLRV 1.229 V 1R/c230 /c246/c61 /c180 /c43 /c231 /c247\n/c232 /c248\n(3)TPS55340\nSLVSBD4E – MAY 2012 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS55340\n7.3.5 Soft-Start\nThe TPS55340 has a built-in soft-start circuit which significantly reduces the start-up current spike and output \nvoltage overshoot. When the IC is enabled, an internal bias current source (6 µA, typical) charges a capacitor \n(CSS) on the SS pin. The voltage at the capacitor clamps the output of the internal error amplifier that determines \nthe peak current and duty cycle of PWM controller. Limiting the peak switch current during start-up with a slow \nramp on the SS pin will reduce in-rush current and output voltage overshoot. Once the capacitor reaches 1.8 V, \nthe soft-start cycle is completed and the soft-start voltage no longer clamps the error amplifier output. When the \nEN is pulled low for at least 1 ms, the IC enters the shutdown mode and the SS capacitor is discharged through \na 5-kΩ resistor to prepare for the next soft-start sequence.\n7.3.6 Slope Compensation\nThe TPS55340 has internal slope compensation to prevent subharmonic oscillations.

In \nshutdown, the input supply current for the device is less than 10 µA (maximum). The EN pin has an internal\n950-kΩ pulldown resistor to disable the device if the pin is floating.\nAn internal thermal shutdown turns off the device when the junction temperature exceeds 165°C (typical). The \ndevice will restart when the junction temperature drops by 15°C.\n7.3.8 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nAn undervoltage lockout circuit prevents mis-operation of the device at input voltages below 2.5 V (typical). \nWhen the input voltage is below the UVLO threshold, the device remains off and the internal power MOSFET is \nturned off. The UVLO threshold is set below minimum operating voltage of 2.9 V to ensure that a transient V IN www.ti.comTPS55340\nSLVSBD4E – MAY 2012 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS55340\ndip will not cause the device to reset. For the input voltages between UVLO threshold and 2.9 V, the device tries \nto operate, but the electrical specifications are not assured.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Operation With V IN < 2.9 V (Minimum V IN)\nThe TPS55340 device operates with input voltages above 2.9 V. The typical UVLO voltage (turning off) is 2.5 \nV and the TPS55340 device remains off at input voltages lower than that point. For the input voltages between \nUVLO threshold and 2.9 V, the device tries to operate, but the electrical specifications are not ensured.\n7.4.2 Operation With EN Control\nThe enable rising-edge threshold voltage is 1.08 V (typical) with 0.16 V hysteresis (typical). With the EN pin held \nbelow the turn-off voltage, the device is disabled and switching is inhibited. The IC quiescent current is reduced \nin this state. When the input voltage is above the UVLO threshold and the EN pin voltage increases above the \nrising edge threshold, the device becomes active. Switching enables and the soft-start sequence initiates. The \nTPS55340 device starts at the soft-start time determined by the external soft-start capacitor.\n7.4.3 Operation at Light Loads\nThe device is designed to operate in high-efficiency, pulse-skipping mode under light load conditions. \nDiscontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM) operation initiates when the switch current falls to 0 A. During DCM \noperation, the catch diode stops conducting when the switch current falls to 0 A. The switching node (the SW \npin) waveform takes on the characteristics of DCM operation as shown in Figure 8-6 . As the load decreases \nfurther and when the voltage-regulation loop of TPS55340 device requires an on-time pulse width less than the \nminimum PWM pulse width of 77 ns (typical), the IC enters pulse-skipping mode. In this mode, the device holds \nthe power switch off for several switching cycles to prevent the output voltage from rising too much above the \ndesired regulated voltage.TPS55340\nSLVSBD4E – MAY 2012 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS55340\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe TPS55340 device can be configured in several standard switching-regulator topologies, including boost, \nSEPIC, and isolated flyback. For example, the device configured in boost topology is widely used to convert a \nlower dc voltage to a higher dc voltage with a maximum available switching current of 5.25 A.

Alternately, use the WEBENCH® software to generate a complete design. The WEBENCH software \nuses an iterative design procedure and accesses a comprehensive database of components when generating a \ndesign. This section presents a simplified discussion of the design process.\n8.2 Typical Applications\nThe following section provides a step-by-step design approach for configuring the TPS55340 as a voltage \nregulating boost converter, as shown in Figure 8-1 . When configured as SEPIC or flyback converter, a different \ndesign approach is required. A design example of SEPIC converter is provided in the next section.\n8.2.1 Boost Converter\n100 pF\nFigure 8-1.

There are tradeoffs to consider for a \nhigher or lower switching frequency. A higher switching frequency allows for lower valued inductor and smaller \noutput capacitors leading to the smallest solution size. A lower switching frequency will result in a larger solution \nsize but better efficiency. The user will typically set the frequency for the minimum tolerable efficiency to avoid \nexcessively large external components.\nA switching frequency of 600 kHz is a good trade-off between efficiency and solution size. The appropriate \nresistor value is found from the resistance versus frequency graph of Figure 6-5 , or calculated using Equation 1 . \nR4 is calculated to be 78.4 k Ω and the nearest standard value resistor of 78.7 k Ω is selected. A resistor must be \nplaced from the FREQ pin to ground, even if an external oscillation is applied for synchronization.\n8.2.1.2.3 Determining the Duty Cycle\nThe input-to-output voltage conversion ratio of the TPS55340 is limited by the worst case maximum duty cycle \nof 89% and the minimum duty cycle which is determined by the minimum on-time of 77 ns and the switching \nfrequency. The minimum duty cycle can be estimated with Equation 7 . With a 600-kHz switching frequency the \nminimum duty cycle is 4%.\nDPS = T ON min × ƒ sw (7)\nThe duty cycle at which the converter operates is dependent on the mode in which the converter is running. If \nthe converter is running in DCM, where the inductor current ramps to zero at the end of each cycle, the duty \ncycle varies with changes of the load much more than it does when running in continuous conduction mode \n(CCM). In CCM, where the inductor maintains a minimum dc current, the duty cycle is related primarily to the \ninput and output voltages as computed below. Assume a 0.5-V drop V D across the Schottky rectifier. At the \nminimum input of 5 V, the duty cycle will be 80%. At the maximum input of 12 V, the duty cycle is 51%.TPS55340\nSLVSBD4E – MAY 2012 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS55340\nOUT D IN\nOUTV V VDV VD/c43 /c45/c61/c43(8)\nAt light loads the converter will operate in DCM. In this case the duty cycle is a function of the load, input and \noutput voltages, inductance, and switching frequency as computed below. This can be calculated only after an \ninductance is chosen in the following section. While operating in DCM with very light load conditions, the duty \ncycle demand will force the TPS55340 to operate with the minimum on-time. The converter will then begin pulse \nskipping which can increase the output ripple.\nOUT D IN OUT SW\nIN2 (V V V ) L IDV/c180 /c43 /c45 /c180 /c180 /c180 /c166/c61\n(9)\nAll converters using a diode as the freewheeling or catch component have a load current level at which \nthey transit from DCM to CCM. At this point the inductor current just falls to zero during the off-time of the \npower switch. At higher load currents, the inductor current does not fall to zero and diode and switch current \nassume a trapezoidal wave shape as opposed to a triangular wave shape. The load current boundary between \ndiscontinuous conduction and continuous conduction can be found for a set of converter parameters as follows:\n/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41OUT D IN IN\nOUT(crit)\nOUT D SW2\n2V V V VI\n2 V V L/c43 /c45 /c180/c61\n/c180 /c43 /c180 /c166 /c180\n(10)\nFor loads higher than the result of Equation 10 , the duty cycle is given by Equation 8 . For loads less than the \nresults of Equation 10 , the duty cycle is given by Equation 9 . For Equation 7  through Equation 10 , the variable \ndefinitions are as follows:\n•VOUT is the output voltage of the converter in V.\n•VD is the forward conduction voltage drop across the rectifier or catch diode in V.\n•VIN is the input voltage to the converter in V.\n•IOUT is the output current of the converter in A.\n•L is the inductor value in H.\n•ƒSW is the switching frequency in Hz.\nUnless otherwise stated, the design equations that follow assume that the converter is running in CCM which \ntypically results in a higher efficiency for the power levels of this converter.\n8.2.1.2.4 Selecting the Inductor (L1)\nThe selection of the inductor affects steady-state operation as well as transient behavior and loop stability. These \nfactors make it the most important component in power regulator design. There are three important inductor \nspecifications: inductor value, dc resistance and saturation current. Considering inductor value alone is not \nenough. Inductor values can have ±20% tolerance with no current bias. When the inductor current approaches \nsaturation level, the effective inductance can fall to a fraction of the zero current value.\nThe minimum value of the inductor should be able to meet the inductor current ripple ( ΔIL) requirement at worst \ncase. In a boost converter, maximum inductor current ripple occurs at 50% duty cycle. For the applications \nwhere duty cycle is always smaller or larger than 50%, Equation 12  should be used with the duty cycle closest \nto 50% and corresponding input voltage to calculate the minimum inductance. For applications that must operate \nwith 50% duty cycle when input voltage is somewhere between the minimum and the maximum input voltage, \nEquation 13  should be used. K IND is a coefficient that represents the amount of inductor ripple current relative \nto the maximum input current (I INDC = I Lavg). The maximum input current can be estimated with Equation 11 , \nwith an estimated efficiency based on similar applications ( ηEST). The inductor ripple current will be filtered by \nthe output capacitor. Therefore, choosing high inductor ripple currents will impact the selection of the output \ncapacitor because the output capacitor must have a ripple current rating equal to or greater than the inductor \nripple current. In general, the inductor ripple value (K IND) is at the discretion of the designer. However, the \nfollowing guidelines may be used.www.ti.comTPS55340\nSLVSBD4E – MAY 2012 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS55340\nFor CCM operation, it is recommended to use K IND values in the range of 0.2 to 0.4. Choosing K IND closer to 0.2 \nresults in a larger inductance value, maximizes the potential output current of the converter and minimizes EMI. \nChoosing K IND closer to 0.4 results in a smaller inductance value, a physically smaller inductor, and improved \ntransient response, but potentially worse EMI and lower efficiency. Using an inductor with a smaller inductance \nvalue may result in the converter operating in DCM. This reduces the maximum output current of the boost \nconverter, causes larger input voltage and output voltage ripple, and reduced efficiency. For this design, choose \nKIND = 0.3 and a conservative efficiency estimate of 85% with the minimum input voltage and maximum output \ncurrent. Equation 12  is used with the maximum input voltage because this corresponds to duty cycle closest to \n50%. The maximum input current is estimated at 4.52 A and the minimum inductance is 7.53 µH. A standard \nvalue of 10 µH is chosen.\nOUT OUT\nIN\nEST INV II DCV min/c180/c61/c104 /c180\n(11)\nIN\nO\nIN IND SWV DL minI DC K/c179 /c180/c180 /c166, D 50%, V with D closest to 50%≠IN\n(12)\n/c40 /c41OUT D\nO\nIN IND SWV V 1L minI DC K 4/c43/c179 /c180/c180 /c180 /c166, D=50%\n(13)\nAfter choosing the inductance, the required current ratings can be calculated. The inductor will be closest to \nits ratings with the minimum input voltage. The ripple with the chosen inductance is calculated with Equation \n14. The RMS and peak inductor current can be found with Equation 15  and Equation 16 . For this design the \ncurrent ripple is 663 mA, the RMS inductor current is 4.52 A, and the peak inductor current is 4.85 A. It is \ngenerally recommended for the peak inductor current rating of the selected inductor be 20% higher to account \nfor transients during powerup, faults, or transient load conditions. The most conservative approach is to specify \nan inductor with a saturation current greater than the maximum peak current limit of the TPS55340. This helps \nto avoid saturation of the inductor. The chosen inductor is a Würth Elektronik 74437368100. It has a saturation \ncurrent rating of 12.5 A, RMS current rating of 5.2 A, and typical DCR of 27.0 mΩ.\nIN\nL\nO SWV min DmaxIL/c68 /c61 /c180/c166\n(14)\n/c40 /c41L\nL IN2\n2 II rms I DC12/c68/c230 /c246/c61 /c43 /c231 /c247/c232 /c248\n(15)\nL\nL INII peak I DC2/c68/c61 /c43\n(16)\nThe TPS55340 has built-in slope compensation to avoid subharmonic oscillation associated with current mode \ncontrol. If the inductor value is too small, the slope compensation may not be adequate, and the loop can be \nunstable.\n8.2.1.2.5 Computing the Maximum Output Current\nThe overcurrent limit for the integrated power MOSFET limits the maximum input current and thus the maximum \ninput power for a given input voltage. Maximum output power is less than maximum input power due to \npower conversion losses. Therefore, the current limit setting, input voltage, output voltage, and efficiency can \nall change maximum current output (I OUTmax). The current limit clamps the peak inductor current; therefore, \nthe ripple has to be subtracted to derive maximum dc current. Decreasing the K IND or designing for a higher \nefficiency will increase the maximum output current. This can be evaluated with the chosen inductance or the \nchosen K IND. This should be evaluated with the minimum input voltage and minimum peak current limit (I LIM) of \n5.25 A.TPS55340\nSLVSBD4E – MAY 2012 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS55340\nL IND\nIN LIM EST IN LIM EST\nOUT\nOUT OUTI KV min I V min I 12 2I maxV V/c68 /c230 /c246 /c230 /c246/c180 /c45 /c180 /c104 /c180 /c180 /c45 /c180 /c104/c231 /c247 /c231 /c247/c232 /c248 /c232 /c248/c61 /c61(17)\nIn this design with a 5-V input boosted to a 24-V output and a 10- μH inductor with an assumed Schottky forward \nvoltage of 0.5 V and estimated efficiency of 85%, the maximum output current is 871 mA. With the 12-V input \nand increased estimated efficiency of 90%, the maximum output current increases to 2.13 A. This circuit was \nevaluated to its maximum output currents with both the minimum and maximum input voltage.\n8.2.1.2.6 Selecting the Output Capacitors (C8, C9, C10)\nAt least 4.7 µF of ceramic-type X5R or X7R capacitance is recommended at the output. The output capacitance \nis mainly selected to meet the requirements for the output ripple (V RIPPLE ) and voltage change during a load \ntransient. Then the loop is compensated for the output capacitor selected. The output capacitance should be \nchosen based on the most stringent of these criteria. The output ripple voltage is related to the capacitance and \nequivalent series resistance (ESR) of the output capacitor. Assuming a capacitor with zero ESR, the minimum \ncapacitance needed for a given ripple can be calculated by Equation 18 . If high ESR capacitors are used, it will \ncontribute additional ripple. The maximum ESR for a specified ripple is calculated with Equation 19 . ESR ripple \ncan be neglected for ceramic capacitors but must be considered if tantalum or electrolytic capacitors are used. \nThe minimum ceramic output capacitance needed to meet a load transient requirement can be estimated by the \nEquation 20 . Equation 21  can be used to calculate the RMS current that the output capacitor needs to support.\nOUT\nOUT\nSW RIPPLEDmax ICV/c180/c179/c166 /c180\n(18)\nOUT\nRIPPLE\nSW OUT\nLDmax IVCESRI/c230 /c246 /c180/c45 /c231 /c247/c166 /c180/c232 /c248/c163/c68\n(19)\nTRAN\nOUT\nBW TRANIC2 V/c68/c179/c180 /c112 /c180 /c166 /c180 /c68\n(20)\n/c40 /c41CO OUTDmaxI rms I1 Dmax/c61/c45\n(21)\nUsing Equation 18  for this design, the minimum output capacitance for the specified 120-mV output ripple is\n8.8 µF. For a maximum transient voltage change ( ΔVTRAN) of 960 mV with a 400-mA load transient ( ΔITRAN) and \na 6-kHz control loop bandwidth (f BW) with Equation 20 , the minimum output capacitance is 11.1 µF. The most \nstringent criteria is the 11.1 µF for the required load transient. Equation 21  gives a 1.58-A RMS current in the \noutput capacitor. The capacitor should also be properly rated for the desired output voltage.\nCare must be taken when evaluating ceramic capacitors that derate under dc bias, aging, and ac signal \nconditions. For example, larger form factor capacitors (in 1206 size) have self-resonant frequencies in the range \nof converter switching frequency. Self-resonance causes the effective capacitance to be significantly lower. \nThe dc bias can also significantly reduce capacitance. Ceramic capacitors can lose as much as 50% of the \ncapacitance when operated at the rated voltage. Therefore, allow a margin in selected capacitor voltage rating \nto ensure adequate capacitance at the required output voltage. For this example, three 4.7-µF, 50-V, 1210 X7R \nceramic capacitors are used in parallel leading to a negligible ESR. Choosing 50-V capacitors instead of 35-V \nreduces the effects of dc bias and allows this example circuit to be rated for the maximum output voltage range \nof the TPS55340.\n8.2.1.2.7 Selecting the Input Capacitors (C2, C7)\nAt least 4.7 µF of ceramic input capacitance is recommended.

The capacitor must also have an RMS current rating greater than the \nmaximum RMS input current of the TPS55340 calculated with Equation 22 .

The chosen input capacitor is a 10-µF, \n35-V, 1210 X7R with 3-m Ω ESR. Although one with a lower voltage rating can be used, a 35-V rated capacitor \nwas chosen to limit the affects of dc bias and to allow the circuit to be rated for the entire input range of the \nTPS55340. The input ripple is calculated to be 30 mV. An additional 0.1-µF, 50-V, 0603 X5R is located close to \nthe VIN and GND pins for extra decoupling.\n8.2.1.2.8 Setting Output Voltage (R1, R2)\nTo set the output voltage in either DCM or CCM, select the values of R1 and R2 according to the following \nequations:\nOUTR1V 1.229 V 1R2/c230 /c246/c61 /c180 /c43/c231 /c247/c232 /c248\n(24)\nOUTVR1 R2 11.229 V/c230 /c246/c61 /c180 /c45 /c231 /c247\n/c232 /c248\n(25)\nConsidering the leakage current through the resistor divider and noise decoupling into the FB pin, an optimum \nvalue for R2 is around 10 k Ω. The output voltage tolerance depends on the V FB accuracy and the tolerance of \nR1 and R2. In this example with a 24-V output using Equation 25 , R1 is calculated to 185.3 k Ω. The nearest \nstandard value of 187 kΩ is used.\n8.2.1.2.9 Setting the Soft-start Time (C7)\nChoose the appropriate capacitor to set soft-start time and avoid overshoot. Increasing the soft-start time \nreduces the overshoot during startup. A 0.047-µF ceramic capacitor is used in this example.\n8.2.1.2.10 Selecting the Schottky Diode (D1)\nThe high switching frequency of the TPS55340 demands high-speed rectification for optimum efficiency. Ensure \nthat the average and peak current ratings of the diode exceed the average output current and peak inductor \ncurrent. In addition, the reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must exceed the regulated output voltage. The \ndiode must also be rated for the power dissipated which can be calculated with Equation 26 .\nPD = V D × IOUT (26)\nIn this conservative design example, the diode is chosen to be rated for the maximum output current of 2.13 A. \nDuring normal operation with 800-mA output current and assuming a Schottky diode drop of 0.5 V, the diode \nmust be capable of dissipating 400 mW. The recommended minimum ratings for this design are a 40-V, 3-A \ndiode. However, to improve the flexibility of this design, a Diodes Inc B540-13-F in an SMC package is used with \nvoltage and current ratings of 40 V and 5 A.\n8.2.1.2.11 Compensating the Control Loop (R3, C4, C5)\nThe TPS55340 requires external compensation which allows the loop response to be optimized for each \napplication. The COMP pin is the output of the internal error amplifier. An external resistor R3 and ceramic \ncapacitor C4 are connected to the COMP pin to provide a pole and a zero, shown in Figure 8-1 . This pole and \nzero, along with the inherent pole and zero of a boost converter, determine the closed-loop frequency response.

Loop compensation should be designed for the \nminimum operating voltage.\nThe following equations summarize the loop equations for the TPS55340 configured as a CCM boost converter. \nThey include the power stage output pole (ƒ OUT) and the right-half-plane zero (ƒ RHPZ) of a boost converter \ncalculated with Equation 27  and Equation 28 , respectively. When calculating ƒ OUT, it is important to include the \nderating of ceramic output capacitors. In the example with an estimated 10.2-µF capacitance, these frequencies \nare calculated to be 980 kHz and 22.1 kHz, respectively. The dc gain (A) of the power stage is calculated with \nEquation 29  and is 39.9 dB in this design. The compensation pole (ƒ P) and zero (ƒ Z) generated by R3, C4, and \ninternal transconductance amplifier are calculated with Equation 30  and Equation 31 , respectively.\nMost CCM boost converters will have a stable control loop if f Z is set slightly above ƒ P through proper \nsizing of R3 and C4. A good starting point is C4 = 0.1 µF and R3 = 2 k Ω. Increasing R3 or reducing C4 \nincreases the closed-loop bandwidth, and therefore improves the transient response. Adjusting R3 and C4 in the \nopposite direction increases the phase and gain margin of the loop, which improves loop stability. It is generally \nrecommended to limit the bandwidth of the loop to the lower of either 1/5 of the switching frequency ƒ SW or 1/3 \nthe RHPZ frequency, ƒ RHPZ shown in Equation 28 .

The power stage frequency response is first measured using a network analyzer at the minimum \n5-V input and maximum 800-mA load. This measurement is shown in Figure 8-2 . In this design only one pole \nand one zero are used, so the maximum phase increase from the compensation will be 180 degrees.

If the layout is not carefully designed, the regulator can suffer \nfrom instability as well as noise problems. The following guidelines are recommended for good PCB layout.\n•To prevent radiation of high-frequency resonance problems, use proper layout of the high-frequency \nswitching path.\n•Minimize the length and area of all traces connected to the SW pin and always use a ground plane under the \nswitching regulator to minimize inter-plane coupling.\n•The high current path, including the internal MOSFET switch, Schottky diode, and output capacitor, contains \nnanosecond rise times and fall times. Keep these rise times and fall times as short as possible.\n•Place the VIN bypass capacitor as close to the VIN pin and the AGND pin as possible to reduce the IC supply \nripple.\n•Connect the AGND and PGND pins to thermal pad directly on the same layer.\n10.2 Layout Example\nLO\nOutput\nFilter\nCapacitorVO VI\nPower Ground\nPower GroundVI\nBypass\nCapacitorVI\nHigh-Frequency\nBypass Capacitor\nC(SS)CI\nFeedback\nResistorsFrequency\nSet\nResistor\nConnect to V Oon the\ninner or bottom layer\nConnect to AGND on the\ninner or bottom layerOutput\nFilter\nCapacitor\nCompensation\nNetworkUVLO\nResistorsBypass capacitor\nforTPS55340 .\nPut close to Pin 291012\n11\n431\n2\n5 6 8 7SW\n16 15 13 14\nPowerPadSW NC PGND\nSYNC AGND COMP FBSSENVINSW\nFREQNCPGNDPGND\nFigure 10-1. TPS55340 Layout Example\n10.3 Thermal Considerations\nThe maximum IC junction temperature should be restricted to 150°C under normal operating conditions.

This package includes a PowerPAD that improves the thermal capabilities of the package. The thermal \nresistance of the QFN package in any application greatly depends on the PCB layout and the PowerPAD \nconnection. The PowerPAD must be soldered to the analog ground on the PCB. Use thermal vias underneath \nthe PowerPAD to achieve good thermal performance.TPS55340\nSLVSBD4E – MAY 2012 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS55340\n11 Device and Documentation Support\n11.1 Device Support\n11.1.1 Third-Party Products Disclaimer\nTI\'S PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DOES NOT \nCONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES \nOR A WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, EITHER \nALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY TI PRODUCT OR SERVICE.\n11.1.2 Development Support\n11.1.2.1 Custom Design with WEBENCH Tools\nClick here  to create a custom design using the TPS55340 device with the WEBENCH® Power Designer.\n1.Start by entering your V IN, VOUT and I OUT requirements.\n2.Optimize your design for key parameters like efficiency, footprint and cost using the optimizer dial and \ncompare this design with other possible solutions from Texas Instruments.\n3.WEBENCH Power Designer provides you with a customized schematic along with a list of materials with real \ntime pricing and component availability.\n4.In most cases, you will also be able to:\n•Run electrical simulations to see important waveforms and circuit performance,\n•Run thermal simulations to understand the thermal performance of your board,\n•Export your customized schematic and layout into popular CAD formats,\n•Print PDF reports for the design, and share your design with colleagues.\n5.Get more information about WEBENCH tools at www.ti.com/webench .\n11.2 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
