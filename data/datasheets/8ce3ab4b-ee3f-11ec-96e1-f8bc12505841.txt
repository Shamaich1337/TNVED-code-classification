For high-est performance, use low equivalent series resistance(ESR) capacitors (e.g., ceramic).\nDuring the first half-cycle, switches S2 and S4 open,\nswitches S1 and S3 close, and capacitor C1 charges tothe voltage at IN (Figure 2). During the second half-cycle, S1 and S3 open, S2 and S4 close, and C1 is level\nshifted downward by V\nINvolts. This connects C1 in par-\nallel with the reservoir capacitor C2. If the voltage acrossC2 is smaller than the voltage across C1, charge flowsfrom C1 to C2 until the voltage across C2 reaches-V\nIN. The actual voltage at the output is more positive\nthan -V IN, since switches S1–S4 have resistance and the\nload drains charge from C2.MAX1719/MAX1720/MAX1721SOT23, Switched-Capacitor\nVoltage Inverters with Shutdown\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 5Typical Operating Characteristics (continued)\n(Circuit of Figure 1, V IN= +5V, SHDN = GND (MAX1719), SHDN = IN (MAX1720/MAX1721), C1 = C2 = C3, T A= +25°C, unless \notherwise noted.)\n0100\n50150300350\n250\n200400\n01 . 0 1 . 5 2 .0 2.5 0.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0MAX1719/MAX1721 \nOUTPUT VOLTAGE RIPPLE vs. CAPACITANCE\nMAX1720/21toc15\nCAPACITANCE ( µF)OUTPUT VOLTAGE RIPPLE (mVp-p)VIN = +4.75V, V OUT = -4.0V\nVIN = +3.15V, V OUT = -2.5V\nVIN = +1.9V, V OUT = -1.5V\n50µs/divMAX1721\nSTART-UP FROM SHUTDOWN\nRL = 1kΩVOUT\n2V/divMAX1720/21toc13\nVSHDN\n5V/div\nNoninverting Shutdown Input.

The typi-\ncal output impedance is more accurately determinedfrom the \nTypical Operating Characteristics .\nShutdown Mode\nThe MAX1719/MAX1720/MAX1721 have a logic-con-\ntrolled shutdown input. Driving SHDN low places the\nMAX1720/MAX1721 in a low-power shutdown mode.The MAX1719’s shutdown input is inverted from that ofthe MAX1720/MAX1721. Driving SHDN high places theMAX1719 in a low-power shutdown mode. The charge-pump switching halts, supply current is reduced to1nA, and OUT is actively pulled to ground through a 4 Ω\nresistance.\nApplications Information\nCapacitor Selection\nTo maintain the lowest output resistance, use capaci-tors with low ESR (Table 1). The charge-pump outputresistance is a function of C1’s and C2’s ESR.Therefore, minimizing the charge-pump capacitor’sESR minimizes the total output resistance. Table 2gives suggested capacitor values for minimizing outputresistance or minimizing capacitor size.R1\nfC 12R 4ESR ESR OUT\nOSCSW C1 C2 ≅() ×++ +\n  \n η≅+−× \uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7I\nIIIR\nVOUT\nOUT QOUT OUT\nIN1  S1\nINS2\nS3 S4C1\nC2\nVOUT  = -(V IN)\nFigure 2.

Above a certain point, increasing C1’scapacitance has a negligible effect because the outputresistance becomes dominated by the internal switchresistance and capacitor ESR.\nOutput Capacitor (C2)\nIncreasing the output capacitor’s value reduces theoutput ripple voltage. Decreasing its ESR reduces bothoutput resistance and ripple. Lower capacitance valuescan be used with light loads if higher output ripple canbe tolerated. Use the following equation to calculate thepeak-to-peak ripple:\nInput Bypass Capacitor (C3)\nBypass the incoming supply to reduce its AC impedanceand the impact of the MAX1719/MAX1720/MAX1721’sswitching noise. A bypass capacitor with a value equalto that of C1 is recommended.\nVoltage Inverter\nThe most common application for these devices is acharge-pump voltage inverter (Figure 1). This applica-tion requires only two external components—capacitorsC1 and C2—plus a bypass capacitor, if necessary.Refer to the Capacitor Selection section for suggested\ncapacitor types. Cascading Devices\nTwo devices can be cascaded to produce an evenlarger negative voltage (Figure 4). The unloaded outputvoltage is normally -2 x V\nIN, but this is reduced slightly\nby the output resistance of the first device multiplied bythe quiescent current of the second. When cascadingmore than two devices, the output resistance rises dra-matically. For applications requiring larger negativevoltages, see the MAX865 and MAX868 data sheets.The maximum load current and startup current of then\nthcascaded circuit must not exceed the maximum\noutput current capability of the (n - 1)thcircuit to ensure\nproper startup.V=I\n2  f   C22  I  ESR RIPPLEOUT\nOSCOUT C2 ××+× ×MAX1719\nMAX1720MAX1721\n“n”MAX1719MAX1720MAX1721\n“1”2\n1 VOUT\nC22+VIN\nC1\nC2\nSHDN (MAX1719)\nSHDN (MAX1720/\nMAX1721)C133\n44\n6\n556 1\nVOUT = -nV IN…\n…\nFigure 4.

Each devicerequires its own pump capacitor (C1), but the reservoircapacitor (C2) serves all devices (Figure 5). IncreaseC2’s value by a factor of n, where n is the number ofparallel devices. Figure 5 shows the equation for calcu-lating output resistance. \nCombined Doubler/Inverter\nIn the circuit of Figure 6, capacitors C1 and C2 form theinverter, while C3 and C4 form the doubler. C1 and C3are the pump capacitors; C2 and C4 are the reservoircapacitors. Because both the inverter and doubler usepart of the charge-pump circuit, loading either outputcauses both outputs to decline toward GND. Make surethe sum of the currents drawn from the two outputsdoes not exceed 25mA.\nHeavy Load Connected to a \nPositive Supply\nUnder heavy loads, where a higher supply is sourcing\ncurrent into OUT, the OUT supply must not be pulledabove ground. Applications that sink heavy current intoOUT require a Schottky diode (1N5817) between GND\nand OUT, with the anode connected to OUT (Figure 7). \nLayout and Grounding\nGood layout is important, primarily for good noise per-formance. To ensure good layout, mount all compo-nents as close together as possible, keep traces shortto minimize parasitic inductance and capacitance, anduse a ground plane.MAX1719\nMAX1720MAX172125\n1\nVOUT = (2V IN) -\n(VFD1) - (V FD2)C2+VIN\nC13\n4\n6VOUT = -V IN\nC4D1D1, D2 = 1N4148\nC3D2SHDN (MAX1719)\nSHDN (MAX1720)\n(MAX1721)\nFigure 6.
