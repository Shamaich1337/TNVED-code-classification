It has been designed for \nsystems with internal calibration. Often these processor-based \nsystems are capable of calibrating corrections for offset and \ngain, but they cannot correct for temperature drifts and noise. Optimized for these parameters, the OPx13 family can be used to take advantage of superior analog performance combined with digital correction. Many systems using internal calibration \noperate from unipolar supplies, usually either 5 V or 12 V . The \nOPx13 family is designed to operate from single supplies from \n4 V to 36 V and to maintain its low noise and precision \nperformance. \nThe OPx13 family is unity gain stable and has a typical gain \nbandwidth product of 3.4 MHz. Slew  rate is in excess of 1 V/μs. \nNoise density is a very low 4.7 nV/√Hz, and noise in the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz band is 120 nV p-p. Input offset voltage is guaranteed \nand offset drift is guaranteed to be less than 0.8 μV/°C. Input \ncommon-mode range includes the negative supply and to within 1 V of the positive supply over the full supply range. Phase reversal protection is designed into the OPx13 family for cases where input voltage range is exceeded. Output voltage \nswings also include the negative supply and go to within 1 V of \nthe positive rail. The output is capable of sinking and sourcing \ncurrent throughout its range and is specified with 600 Ω loads.

Other \napplications include use as a buffer or amplifier for both analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) sigma-delta \nconverters. Often these converters have high resolutions \nrequiring the lowest noise amplifier to utilize their full potential. Many of these converters operate in either single-supply or low-supply voltage systems, and attaining the greater \nsignal swing possible increases system performance. \nThe OPx13 family is specified for single 5 V and dual ±15 V \noperation over the XIND—extended industrial temperature \nrange (–40°C to +85°C). They are available in PDIP and SOIC \nsurface-mount packages. \n \nOP113/OP213/OP413  \n \nRev.

F | Page 13 of 24 APPLICATIONS \nThe OP113, OP213, and OP413 form a new family of high \nperformance amplifiers that feature precision performance in standard dual-supply configurations and, more importantly, maintain precision performance when a single power supply is \nused. In addition to accurate dc specifications, it is the lowest \nnoise single-supply amplifier available with only 4.7 nV/√Hz \ntypical noise density. \nSingle-supply applications have special requirements due to the \ngenerally reduced dynamic range of the output signal. Single-supply applications are often operated at voltages of 5 V or 12 V , compared to dual-supply applications with supplies of ±12 V or \n±15 V . This results in reduced output swings. Where a dual-\nsupply application may often have 20 V of signal output swing, single-supply applications are limited to, at most, the supply range and, more commonly, several volts below the supply.  In order to attain the greatest swing, the single-supply output stage must swing closer to the supply rails than in dual-supply \napplications. \nThe OPx13 family has a new patented output stage that allows \nthe output to swing closer to ground, or the negative supply, than previous bipolar output stages. Previous op amps had outputs that could swing to within about 10 mV of the negative supply in single-supply applications. However, the OPx13 family combines both a bipolar and a CMOS device in the output stage, enabling it to swing to within a few hundred μV of ground. \nWhen operating with reduced supply voltages, the input range is also reduced. This reduction in signal range results in reduced signal-to-noise ratio for any given amplifier. There are only two ways to improve this: increase the signal range or reduce the noise. The OPx13 family addresses both of these parameters. Input signal range is from the negative supply to \nwithin 1 V of the positive supply over the full supply range. \nCompetitive parts have input ranges that are 0.5 V to 5 V less than this. Noise has also been optimized in the OPx13 family. \nAt 4.7 nV/√Hz, the noise is less than one fourth that of competitive \ndevices.  PHASE REVERSAL \nThe OPx13 family is protected against phase reversal as long as \nboth of the inputs are within the supply ranges. However, if \nthere is a possibility of either input going below the negative supply (or ground in the single-supply case), the inputs should be protected with a series resistor to limit input current to 2 mA.  \nOP113 OFFSET ADJUST \nThe OP113 has the facility for external offset adjustment, using the industry standard arrangement. Pin 1 and Pin 5 are used in \nconjunction with a potentiometer of 10 kΩ total resistance, \nconnected with the wiper to V− (or ground in single-supply applications). The total adjustment range is about ±2 mV using \nthis configuration. \nAdjusting the offset to 0 has minimal effect on offset drift \n(assuming the potentiometer has a tempco of less than 1000 ppm/°C). Adjustment away from 0, however, (as with all \nbipolar amplifiers) results in a TCV\nOS of approximately \n3.3 μV/°C for every millivolt of induced offset. \nIt is, therefore, not generally recommended that this trim be \nused to compensate for system errors originating outside of the OP113. The initial offset of the OP113 is low enough that external trimming is almost never required, but if necessary, the 2 mV trim range may be somewhat excessive. Reducing the \ntrimming potentiometer to a 2 kΩ value results in a more \nreasonable range of ±400 μV . \n \n \nOP113/OP213/OP413  \n \nRev. F | Page 14 of 24 APPLICATION CIRCUITS\nA HIGH PRECISION INDUSTRIAL LOAD-CELL \nSCALE AMPLIFIER \nThe OPx13 family makes an excellent amplifier for \nconditioning a load-cell bridge. Its low noise greatly improves \nthe signal resolution, allowing the load cell to operate with a \nsmaller output range, thus reducing its nonlinearity. Figure 41  \nshows one half of the OPx13 family used to generate a very \nstable 10 V bridge excitation voltage while the second amplifier provides a differential gain.

A stable 4 V bridge voltage is made possible by the rail-to-rail OP295 amplifier, whose output can swing to within a millivolt of either rail. This high voltage swing greatly increases the bridge output signal without a corresponding \nincrease in bridge input. 3\n28\n1 2N2222A2.5V\n1/2\nOP295\n42\n46IN\nOUT\nGNDREF43\n4V5V\n1/2\nOP21313\n28\n65\n47\nR4\n100kΩR3\n20kΩ\nR6\n27.4ΩR5\n2.1kΩR2\n20kΩ\nR1\n100kΩ1/2\nOP295\nRG = 2127.4Ω5V\nOUTPUT\n0V     3.5V+\n–\n+\n–350Ω\n35mV\nFSR8\n12kΩR7\n20kΩ\n+\n–\n00286-041 \nFigure 42. Single Supply Strain Gage Amplifier \nA HIGH ACCURACY LINEARIZED RTD \nTHERMOMETER AMPLIFIER \nZero suppressing the bridge facilitates simple linearization of \nthe resistor temperature device (RTD) by feeding back a small \namount of the output signal to the RTD. In Figure 43 , the left \nleg of the bridge is servoed to a virtual ground voltage by \nAmplifier A1, and the right leg of the bridge is servoed to 0 V by Amplifier A2. This eliminates any error resulting from common-mode voltage change in the amplifier. A 3-wire RTD \nis used to balance the wire resistance on both legs of the bridge, \nthereby reducing temperature mismatch errors. The 5 V bridge excitation is derived from the extremely stable AD588 reference \ndevice with 1.5 ppm/°C drift performance. \nLinearization of the RTD is done by feeding a fraction of the \noutput voltage back to the RTD in the form of a current. With just the right amount of positive feedback, the amplifier output will be linearly proportional to the temperature of the RTD. \n  OP113/OP213/OP413\n \nRev.

Adjust the zero adjust potentiometer for a 0 V output, and then set R9, \nlinearity adjust potentiometer, to the middle of its adjustment \nrange. Substitute a 280.9 Ω resistor (equivalent to 500°C) in place of the RTD, and adjust the full-scale adjust potentiometer \nfor a full-scale voltage of 5 V . \nTo calibrate out the nonlinearity, substitute a 194.07 Ω resistor \n(equivalent to 250°C) in place of the RTD, and then adjust the linearity adjust potentiometer for a 2.5 V output. Check and readjust the full-scale and half-scale as needed.  \nOnce calibrated, the amplifier outputs a 10 mV/°C temperature coefficient with an accuracy better than ±0.5°C over an RTD measurement range of −150°C to +500°C. Indeed the amplifier \ncan be calibrated to a higher temperature range, up to 850°C. \nA HIGH ACCURACY THERMOCOUPLE AMPLIFIER \nFigure 44  shows a popular K-type thermocouple amplifier with \ncold-junction compensation. Operating from a single 12 V \nsupply, the OPx13 family’s low noise allows temperature measurement to better than 0.02°C resolution over a 0°C to \n1000°C range. The cold-junction error is corrected by using an \ninexpensive silicon diode as a temperature measuring device.  It should be placed as close to the two terminating junctions as physically possible.
