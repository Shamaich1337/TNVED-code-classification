This forces the 1.5 nH lead inductance of leads 1 and 2 to appear as part of a low pass ﬁlter, reducing the shuntparasitic inductance and increasing the maximum available attenuation. The 0.3 nHof shunt inductance external to the diode is created by the via holes, and is a good  estimate for  0.032" thick material.Typical Applications for HSMP-481x Low Inductance Series\n123\nHSMP-481x\nFigure 6.

This layout provides ample allowance for package placement by automated  assembly equipment without adding parasitics that could impair the performance. SMT Assembly \nReliable assembly of surface mount components is a \ncomplex process that involves many material, process, and equipment factors, including: method of heating (e.g., IR or vapor phase reﬂow, wave soldering, etc.) circuit board material, conductor thickness and pattern, type of solder alloy, and the thermal conductivity and thermal mass of components. Components with a low mass, such as the SOT-323/-23 package, will reach solder reﬂow tempera-tures faster than those with a greater mass. \nAfter ramping up from room temperature, the circuit board \nwith components attached to it (held in place with solder paste) passes through one or more preheat zones. The preheat zones increase the temperature of the board and components to prevent thermal shock and begin evaporat-ing solvents from the solder paste. The reﬂow zone brieﬂy elevates the temperature suﬃciently to produce a reﬂow of the solder. \nThe rates of change of temperature for the ramp-up and \ncool-down zones are chosen to be low enough to not cause deformation of the board or damage to components due to thermal shock. The maximum temperature in the reﬂow zone (T\nMAX) should not exceed 260°C. \nThese parameters are typical for a surface mount assembly \nprocess for Avago diodes. As a general guideline, the circuit board and components should be exposed only to the minimum temperatures and times necessary to achieve a uniform reﬂow of solder. 0.026\n0.0390.079\n0.022\nDimensions in inches \n0.039\n10.039\n1\n0.079\n2.0\n0.031\n0.8\nDimensions in inches\nmm 0.035\n0.9Figure 12.
