They are protected against short circuit and thermal overloads. (see block \ndiagram).  \nThermal protection circuitry will shut down the regulator should the junction temperature exceed + 150°C at the sense point. The ZLDO1117 is \npin compatible with similar ‘1117 regulators and o ffers extended temperature range and improved regulation specifications.  \n \nOperation  \nThe ZLDO1117 develops a 1.25V reference voltage between the output and the adjust terminal (see block diagram). By placing a resistor \nbetween these two terminals, a constant current is caused to flow through R1 and down through R2. For fixed output variants Resistors R1 and \nR2 are internal.  \n \nStability  \nThe ZLDO1117 requires an output capacitor as part of the device frequency compensation. As part of its improved performance over industry \nstandard 1117 the ZLDO1117 is suitable for use with MLCC (Multi Layer Ceramic Chip) capacitors. A minimum of 4.7µF ceramic X7 R, 4.7µF \ntantalum, or 47 µF of aluminum electrolytic is required. The ESR of the output capacitor should be less than 0.5Ω. Surface mount tantalum capacitors, which have very low ESR, are available from several manufacturers. When using MLCC capacitors avoid the use of Y5 V dielectrics.  \n \nLoad Regulation  \nFor improved load regulation the ZLDO1117- ADJ should have the upper feedback resistor, R 1, connected as close as possible to V OUT and the \nlower resistor,  R2, connected as close as possible to the load GND return. This helps reduce any parasitic resistance in series with the load.   \n \nThermal Considerations  \nZLDO1117 series r egulators have internal thermal limiting circuitry designed to protect the device during overload conditions. For continuous \nnormal load conditions however, the maximum junction temperature rating of +125°C must not be exceeded.  \nIt is important to give car eful consideration to all sources of thermal resistance from junction to ambient. For the SOT223- 3L and TO252- 3L \npackages, which are designed to be surface mounted, additional heat sources mounted near the device must also be considered. Heat sinking is \naccomplished using the heat spreading capability of the PCB and its copper traces. The θJC (junction to tab)of the TO252- 3L and SOT223- 3L are \n+12°C/W and + 16°C/W respectively.  \nThermal resistances from tab to ambient can be as low as + 30°C/W. The total thermal resistance from junction to ambient can be as low as     \n+42 to + 46°C/W. This requires a reasonable sized PCB with at least one layer of copper to spread the heat across the board and couple it into \nthe surrounding air. Datasheet specifications using 2 oz copper and a 5mmx5mm pad with T A = +27°C, no air flow yielded θJA (junction to tab)  of \n+73°C/W  and +107°C/W  for TO252- 3L and SOT223- 3L respectively.  \nThe thermal resistance for each application will be affected by thermal interactions with other components on the board. Some experimentation \nwill be necessary to determine the actual value.  \n \nRipple Rejection  \nWhen using the ZLDO1117 adjustable device the adjust terminal can be bypassed to improve ripple rejection. When the adjust terminal is bypassed the required value of the output capacitor increases.  \nThe device will require an output capacitor of 22µF tantalum or 150µF aluminum electrolytic when the adjust pin is bypassed. Normally, capacitor \nvalues on the order of 100µF are used in the output of many regulators to ensure good load transient response with large load current changes. \nOutput capacitance can be increased without limit and larger values of output capacitance further improve stability and transient response.  \nThe curves for Ripple Rejection were generated using an adjustable device with the adjust pin bypassed. These curves will hol d true for all \nvalues of output voltage. For proper bypassing,  and ripple rejection approaching the values shown, the impedance of the adjust pin capacitor, at \nthe ripple frequency, should be < R1. R1 is normally in the range of 100Ω to 200Ω. The size of the required adjust pin capaci tor is a function of \nthe input ri pple frequency. At 120Hz, with R1 = 100Ω, the adjust pin capacitor should be >13µF. At 10kHz only 0.16µF is needed.  \nFor fixed voltage devices, and adjustable devices without an adjust pin capacitor, the output ripple will increase as the rat io of the output voltage \nto the reference voltage (V\nOUT/VREF). For example, with the output voltage equal to 5V, the output ripple will be increased by the ratio of 5V/1.25V. \nIt will increase by a factor of four. Ripple rejection will be degraded by 12dB from the value s hown on the curve.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nZLDO1117  \nDocument number: DS32018 Rev. 7 - 3 8 of 14 \nwww.diodes.com   August 2021  \n© Diodes Incorporated  \n ZLDO1117  \n \n \nTypical Application Circuits  \n \n \nC2\n100µF 10µFZLDO 1117\nIN OUT\nADJ\nC1\nR2R1\n110Ω\n330ΩVin Vout = 5V\n \nFigure 1 Basic Adjustable Regulator with 5V O utput   \n \nUsing  \n\uf8f3\uf8f2\uf8f1\n\uf8fe\uf8fd\uf8fc+•=1R2R1 25.1 VOUT  \n \nthen the output voltage becomes:  \n \nV0.51103301 25.1 VOUT =\n\uf8f3\uf8f2\uf8f1\n\uf8fe\uf8fd\uf8fc+•=  \n  \n \n100µF 10µFZLDO 1117\nIN OUT\nADJ\nCADJR2R1\n(see Note B)(see Note C)Vin\n(see Note A)Vout\nVREF\nIADJ1N4002 (See Note D)\n \nFigure 2 Adjustable Regulator with IADJ E rrors  \n2R I1R2R1 25.1 VADJ OUT •+\n\uf8f3\uf8f2\uf8f1\n\uf8fe\uf8fd\uf8fc+•=  \nBecause I ADJ typically is 55μA, its effect is negligible in most applications.  \nV02.5 330 10551103301 25.1 V6\nOUT =\n\uf8f3\uf8f2\uf8f1\n\uf8fe\uf8fd\uf8fc••++•=−~ 0.4%  \n \nA.

**Description:**
The ZLDO1117G33TA is a low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator designed to provide a stable output voltage of 3.3V with a maximum output current of 1A. It features a low dropout voltage of 1.2V, making it suitable for applications where the input voltage is only slightly higher than the output voltage. The device is available in both adjustable and fixed output voltage configurations, with the fixed version providing a precise 3.3V output.

**Typical Applications:**
The ZLDO1117 is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Power management for low voltage ICs
- High-speed bus termination
- Low current logic supply (3.3V)
- Automotive electronics (due to AEC-Q100 qualification)
- General-purpose voltage regulation in consumer electronics

This component is particularly useful in scenarios where space is limited, and efficient power regulation is required, such as in portable devices and embedded systems. Its ability to work with MLCC capacitors also enhances its performance in compact designs.
