The highly \nreliable 2-piece design (fence and cover) accommodates \nvirtually any through-hole or surface mount application.Slot-Lok™  Shields\nAs close to custom as you can get…without the cost!\nSlot-Lok™ shields are designed and manufactured using \nproprietary methods that increase shield design flexibility \nwhile reducing lead time and total product cost.  If you \nneed a cost-effective shielding solution with near limitless \ndesign flexibility, Slot-Lok™ is the option of choice.Multi-Cavity designs\nWhen space, weight and costs are all design priorities.\nOur flexible CBS and Slot Lok design and manufacturing \nprocesses allow engineers to effectively isolate multiple \ncomponents using the same shield.  The custom designed \nproduct typically incorporates multiple internal cavities that \nshare connecting walls and a single cover.  This allows for \na reduction in shield weight and occupied board space.\nCustom shielding solutions\nIf you can describe it, we can manufacture it.\nDecades of engineering and manufacturing experience \nprovide you with the ultimate board level shielding flexibility.  \nFrom 3D modeling, material selection and prototyping to high \nvolume production, we are with you every step of the way.\nThe Leading Edge in EMI Shielding T echnology\n3Shielding at the Source\nFIGURE 1\nFIGURE 4\nFIGURE 5\nFIGURE 6 A B C D\nSTYLE FIG.

To satisfy these demanding requirements, \nLeader Tech offers a cost-effective, multi-cavity version of its standard CBS \nproduct line. \nOur proprietary multi-cavity manufacturing process gives engineers the \nflexibility to isolate multiple board-level components using the same shield.  \nThe near-custom product uses “off-the-shelf” components to create multiple \ninternal cavities that share connecting walls and a single cover.  This allows \nfor a significant reduction in shield weight and allocated board space while \nmaintaining tight cost controls.\nIn addition to unmatched performance, Leader Tech Multi-Cavity CBS shields \nalso help reduce your final assembly cost and time-to-market.

#### Description:
The 44-CBSA-2.0X3.5X0.4 is a circuit board shielding component manufactured by Leader Tech. It is part of their Circuit Board Shield (CBS) series, which is designed to provide effective electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) shielding for sensitive electronic components on printed circuit boards (PCBs). The shield is constructed from pre-tin plated steel and features a two-piece design that includes a fence and a cover, allowing for easy access to the components within the shield.

#### Typical Applications:
This component is typically used in applications where EMI/RFI shielding is critical, such as:
- **Consumer Electronics**: Protecting sensitive components in devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
- **Telecommunications**: Shielding components in communication devices to ensure signal integrity.
- **Medical Devices**: Ensuring that sensitive medical electronics are shielded from interference.
- **Automotive Electronics**: Protecting automotive control systems from EMI/RFI that could affect performance.
- **Industrial Equipment**: Shielding sensitive control and monitoring systems in industrial applications.

The 44-CBSA-2.0X3.5X0.4 is ideal for engineers looking for a reliable and flexible shielding solution that can be customized to fit specific design requirements while maintaining high performance in EMI/RFI protection.
