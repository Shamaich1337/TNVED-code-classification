C | 5 of 25Figure 2. Pin Configuration\nTable 5. Pin Function Descriptions\nPin No. Mnemonic Description\n1, 2 VDD Supply Voltage Pins. The voltage applied to VDD must be higher than the intended voltage on the VDRAIN output to account for the drop\nacross the series resistance of the internal metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). The expected voltage drop can be\ncalculated as shown in the MOSFET Series Resistance  section. See Figure 34 , Figure 35 , and Figure 44  for examples of appropriate voltage\nlevels.

Connect this pin to VDD and decouple with a 100 pF capacitor.\n8 CP_OUT Negative Voltage Generator Charge Pump Output.

Decouple VDIG with parallel 4.7 µF and 10 nF capacitors.\n10 VREF 1.44 V Reference Voltage Output from the Internal Low Dropout (LDO) Regulator. VREF is used to alter the voltages on the VNEG and\nVGATE pins. See the Changing the Default VNEG Voltage  and the Changing the VGATE Threshold Voltage  sections for more details.\n11 VNEGFB Feedback Pin for Enabling and Regulating the Output of the Negative Voltage Generator. Float VNEGFB to activate the negative voltage\ngenerator, and short VNEGFB to ground to disable the negative voltage generator. VNEGFB can also be used to adjust VNEG with an\nexternal resistor. See the Changing the Default VNEG Voltage  section for more details.\n12 VGATEFB Feedback Pin for Regulating the VGATE threshold.

VG2_CONT sets the level for the second gate output pin, VG2. Use a resistor divider between VDD and ground to set\nthe voltage. VG2 is typically 1.3 V lower than VG2CONT. See the VG2 Voltage Adjustment  section for more details.\n14 VG2 Second Gate Control Output Pin. VG2 is used to drive the secondary gate voltage for amplifiers that require multiple gate voltages.

A precision resistor (for example, 0.5%, ±25 ppm TCR) connected to ISET determines the undercurrent limit at\nwhich the ALM output goes high.

The total external resistance from ISET pin to ground must always be within 1% of 5 k Ω. If the ALM feature is used,\nthere must be an extra resistor from ALML (Pin 21) to ground for a total resistance from ISET to ground of 5 k Ω. If the ALML feature is not\nused, connect ALML (Pin 21) and ALMH (Pin 23) to ISET and connect a 5 k Ω resistor to ground from ISET.

C | 12 of 25OVERVIEW\nTo achieve consistent performance, amplifiers require stable drain\ncurrent. The HMC980LP4E  is a fully integrated biasing solution\nfor amplifiers, which removes the need for discrete biasing. Using\nan internal feedback loop and a precision external resistor, the\nautomatic gate voltage controller keeps the drain current of the\nassociated amplifier constant over temperature and process varia-\ntions.\nPOWER-UP AND POWER-DOWN\nThe HMC980LP4E  also allows safe power-up and power-down se-\nquencing of the targeted amplifier. The HMC980LP4E  can provide\nthe ideal bias solution to virtually any amplifier on the market with\na drain current up to 1.6 A and a supply voltage between 5 V and\n16.5 V.\nNEGATIVE VOLTAGE GENERATOR\nThe HMC980LP4E  has an integrated negative voltage generator\nused to create the negative voltage required to drive depletion\nmode amplifiers. If an external negative supply is already available\nor an enhancement mode device is targeted, the negative voltage\ngenerator can be disabled.\nVGATE OUTPUT CONTROL LOOP\nThe HMC980LP4E  regulates the drain current (IDRAIN) of the ampli-\nfier under bias using the VGATE output, which is connected to the\ngate bias pin of the external amplifier. The drain current passing\nthrough the associated amplifier is sampled and used to automati-\ncally adjust the voltage on the VGATE pin to achieve constant drain\ncurrent through the external amplifier.\nThis control loop continuously adjusts the VGATE pin voltage to\nachieve consistent drain current over supply, temperature, and\nprocess variations, as well as threshold drifts due to aging.\nThe device to device, temperature, and supply variation of the\nHMC980LP4E  is minimal. Thus, by using an accurate sense resis-\ntor connected to the ISENSE pin, expensive calibration procedures\nin high volume production can be avoided.\nThe gate control of the HMC980LP4E  is designed to both sink\nand source current into the gate of the targeted amplifier, up to\n±4 mA. This unique feature is important to achieve nearly constant\ndrain current through the amplifier while the gate current varies with\ndifferent input power values.\nSTABILITY\nThe HMC980LP4E  allows for stable RF amplifier biasing over\nsupply and temperature variations. The gate control can both sink\nand source current up to ±4 mA. The gate control is required to\ncompensate for charging the gate current of the amplifier over input\npower variations.SECONDARY GATE CONTROL\nThe HMC980LP4E  also generates a second gate voltage, VG2.\nVG2 is fixed and can be adjusted through a resistor divider con-\nnected to VDD for amplifiers that require a second gate voltage.\nEXTERNAL AMPLIFIER POWER SEQUENCING\nTo ensure the safety of the external amplifier, the HMC980LP4E\nprovides automatic power-up sequencing. During startup, VDRAIN\nand VG2 are kept at ground when VGATE is first reduced to VNEG\nto ensure that the external amplifier is completely pinched off before\nVDRAIN is applied. When the EN signal is taken high, VDRAIN is\nthen applied and the active bias loop is enabled. After VDRAIN is\napplied, VG2 is generated and VGATE is increased linearly until the\ndesired drain current is reached.\nFor power-down and disabling, the same sequencing is applied in\nreverse order.\nOVERCURRENT/UNDERCURRENT ALARM\nThe HMC980LP4E  has a built in overcurrent and undercurrent\nalarm feature. If a fault condition arises, ALM goes high, indicating\na problem. The current alarm signal provided in the HMC980LP4E\ndoes not affect the operation of the controller. This feature is\nincluded for monitoring purposes where a system level protection\nscheme can be implemented with external control circuitry.\nSELF PROTECTION\nThe HMC980LP4E  has a built in sensing feature to protect itself\nagainst short-circuit conditions at both the VDRAIN and VNEG pins.\nWhen a short-circuit event is detected, VDRAIN and VGATE are\nboth disabled.\nData Sheet HMC980LP4E\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. C | 13 of 25CONTROLLING DEPLETION MODE RF\nAMPLIFIERS\nFigure 34  and Figure 35  show typical circuits for biasing depletion\nmode amplifiers using the internal VNEG and an external negative\nvoltage (VEXT), respectively. The subsequent sections describe how\nto configure the circuitry around the HMC980LP4E  and how to\ncalculate the correct component values.\nSUPPLY VOLTAGES\nThe HMC980LP4E  requires a minimum of two separate supply\nrails: VDIG and VDD.VDIG (Pin 9, 3.3 V to 5 V) powers the internal logic circuits for\nthe HMC980LP4E . The current drawn on this rail is approximately\n3.5 mA.\nVDD (Pin 1 and Pin 2, 5 V to 16.5 V) provides the power for\nthe RF amplifier and some of the HMC980LP4E  internal circuitry.\nDepending on the RF amplifier being controlled, the VDD current\ncan be up to 1.6 A.\nFigure 34. Typical Circuit for Controlling a Depletion Mode Amplifier Using the Internal VNEG\nFigure 35. Typical Circuit for Controlling a Depletion Mode Amplifier Using an External Negative Voltage (VEXT)\nData Sheet HMC980LP4E\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. C | 14 of 25SUPPLY SEQUENCING\nTo ensure that the HMC980LP4E  control circuitry powers up safely\nand in the correct sequence, it is important to apply the external\nsupply rails in the proper order.\nAlways apply the VDIG supply (Pin 9) first to the HMC980LP4E .\nSecondly, apply the VDD (Pin 1 and Pin 2) voltage to the\nHMC980LP4E . If operating the HMC980LP4E  with an external\nnegative voltage on VNEG (see Table 7 ), apply this voltage to\nVNEG (Pin 15) last.\nAfter all supply voltages are on, the HMC980LP4E  can be enabled\nby asserting EN (Pin 5) to begin biasing the RF amplifier. Note that\nEN has an internal pull ‑up to VDIG.\nDRAIN VOLTAGE OUTPUT\nThe VDD supply to the HMC980LP4E  is connected to the VDRAIN\noutput through an internal MOSFET switch. This MOSFET is con-\ntrolled through power-up sequencing, which ensures that no voltage\nis applied to the drain of the RF amplifier until after the gate voltage\nis pulled down and that the external amplifier is pinched off. Con-\nnect the VDRAIN output (Pin 17 and Pin 18) of the HMC980LP4E\nto the drain (collector) of the RF amplifier.\nSETTING THE TARGET DRAIN CURRENT\nThe target drain current for the RF amplifier is set using a precision\nresistor, RSENSE  (see Figure 35 ), connected from ISENSE (Pin 20)\nto ground. Use the following equation to set the desired drain\ncurrent through the RF amplifier:\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 R SE NSE Ω =150\nI DR AI N\nBase the target drain current on the current that the RF amplifier\nrequires to deliver the desired performance and not necessarily on\nthe quiescent current of the RF amplifier with no RF signal present.\nMOSFET SERIES RESISTANCE\nThere is a small voltage drop between VDD and VDRAIN due to the\nfinite RDS_ON  of the internal MOSFET. To compensate for this, VDD\nmust be set to the value calculated using the following equation:\n     VDD (V) = VDRAIN + IDRAIN × RDS_ON\nwhere:\nVDRAIN is the output voltage from the HMC980LP4E  that is applied\nto the VDD pin of the RF amplifier.\nIDRAIN is the desired constant drain current through the RF amplifier.\nRDS_ON  can be varied and is set by the logic levels of S0 and S1\n(Pin 3 and Pin 4). As the target drain current increases, reduce the\nvalue of RDS_ON . Use Table 6  to determine the correct settings for\nS0 and S1. Note that S0 and S1 have pull-up resistors to VDIG.\nTherefore, if left floating, the S0 and S1 pins default to high.Using settings other than the recommended values for S0 and S1\nmay result in increased power consumption and increased device\nto device performance variation.\nTable 6. Recommended S0 and S1 Settings vs. Drain Current Range\nDrain Current\nRange (A) Condition RDS_ON  Value ( Ω)\n0.05 to 0.3 S1 = ground, S0 = ground 2.8\n0.3 to 0.6 S1 = ground, S0 = VDIG 1.55\n0.6 to 1.2 S1 = VDIG, S0 = ground 0.85\n1.2 to 1.6 S1 = VDIG, S0 = VDIG 0.7\nENABLE INPUT\nThe active bias control loop is enabled when the EN pin is pulled\nup to VDIG. The loop is disabled when the EN pin is pulled down to\nground. If EN is left floating, the HMC980LP4E  is enabled through\na pull-up resistor internally. The operation of the negative voltage\ngenerator is independent of the enable condition. The EN signal\nonly controls the operation of the VGATE, VG2, and VDRAIN\noutputs. When EN is pulled down to ground, the HMC980LP4E\ndischarges VDRAIN and VG2 down to ground and pulls the VGATE\npin to VNEG. VGATE goes down to VNEG regardless of the\nthreshold level setting of VGATEFB. When EN is pulled high, the\nHMC980LP4E  enables VDRAIN and VG2 as well as starting the\nbias control loop to automatically adjust the VGATE output voltage.\nVG2 VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT\nThe HMC980LP4E  generates a second fixed gate voltage, VG2\n(Pin 14) for amplifiers that require a second gate bias connec-\ntion. VG2 can be adjusted through a resistor divider connected\nto VG2_CONT (Pin 13). VG2 can range between 1 V and\nVDD − 1.3 V. Therefore, VG2 is always positive. VG2 is typically\n1.3 V below the voltage present at the VG2_CONT pin. See Figure\n36 for an example of how to set VG2.\nFigure 36. Resistor Divider Used to Set VG2\nUse the following equations to calculate the voltage at VG2_CONT\n(Pin 13) and VG2 (Pin 14):\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 V G 2 _ C ON T (V) = V DD ×R 4\nR 3 + R 4\nData Sheet HMC980LP4E\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. C | 15 of 25          VG2 (V) = VG2_CONT  – 1.3 V\nSELF PROTECTION\nDue to the small RDS_ON  of the internal MOSFET between VDD\nand VDRAIN, a large amount of current may flow through the\nHMC980LP4E . The HMC980LP4E  attempts to protect itself by disa-\nbling the VDRAIN and VGATE output voltages during a short-circuit\nevent on either pin. The HMC980LP4E  remains in this disabled\nmode until a full power cycle or an enable/disable cycle is applied.\nWhen the HMC980LP4E  is controlling depletion mode amplifiers,\nVNEG is continuously monitored for short-circuit faults to ground. If\nVNEG rises above a preset value (typically −0.6 V), the VDRAIN\nand VG2 outputs are pulled to ground while VGATE is pulled to\nVNEG. The HMC980LP4E  stays in this standby mode until the fault\ncondition at VNEG is corrected.\nOVERCURRENT/UNDERCURRENT ALARM\nThe HMC980LP4E  provides an overcurrent and undercurrent alarm\nindicator, ALM (Pin 6). The ALM pin is pulled up to VDIG when\nthe amplifier drain current exceeds the set values for minimum\nor maximum drain currents. Note that the ALM pin status does\nnot affect the operation of HMC980LP4E  and is provided only for\nmonitoring purposes.\nThe overcurrent and undercurrent limits are set using three resis-\ntors, as shown in Figure 37 . The resistor values shown in Figure\n37 represent alarm thresholds of ±6%. However, the thresholds do\nnot need to be symmetrically placed around the target drain current.\nThe threshold values also possess a small built in hysteresis. Note\nthat the total external resistance from the ISET pin to ground (R12+ R13) must be within 1% of 5 k Ω. The resistor values for Figure 37\ncan be calculated using the following equations:\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 I U CTH A = I DR AI N × 1 −R 1 2\nR 1 2 + R 1 3\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 I OC TH A = I DR AI N × 1 +R 11\nR 12 + R 13\nwhere:\nIUCTH is the undercurrent alarm threshold.\nIOCTH is the overcurrent alarm threshold.\nThe ALM pin status is shown with a varying IDRAIN value in Figure\n38.\nFigure 37.

C | 16 of 25NEGATIVE VOLTAGE GENERATOR\nThe HMC980LP4E  has an internal charge pump that generates\nthe negative voltage rail, VNEG, required for biasing depletion\nmode devices. By default, the HMC980LP4E  generates −2.46 V at\nthe CP_OUT pin. This charge pump requires two diodes and two\ncapacitors connected externally, as shown in Figure 39 .\nFigure 39. External Components Required for the Negative Voltage GeneratorThe HMC980LP4E  is designed to reject the ripple on the CP_OUT\npin by isolating VGATE from the CP_OUT pin. Thus, the noise of\nthe charge pump is effectively isolated from the gate of the RF\namplifier.\nDISABLING THE INTERNAL NEGATIVE\nVOLTAGE GENERATOR\nThe charge pump can be disabled using the VNEGFB pin if an\nenhancement mode amplifier is being biased or if the desired\nnegative supply is already available in the system. In either case,\nground the VNEGFB pin to disable the internal charge pump. If\nusing an external negative voltage, connect the negative supply\nto VNEG (Pin 15). See Table 7  for more details on selection of\nthe operating modes. When using an external negative voltage for\ndepletion mode amplifiers, the external voltage must be between\n−2.3 V and −3.5 V for the HMC980LP4E  to operate properly.\nTable 7.

By default,\nthe internal charge pump sets VNEG to −2.46 V. In some cases,\nVNEG may need to be adjusted to force VGATE to operate over\na specific voltage range, for example, when an amplifier requires\ngate voltages more negative than −2 V to fully shut off, or when the\nabsolute maximum rating of an amplifier for VGATE is less negative\nthan −2 V.\nVNEG can be adjusted using an external resistor. To set VNEG\nto a voltage lower (more negative) than the default, a resistor is\nconnected between VNEGFB and VREF (Pin 11 and Pin 10). Use\nthe following equation to calculate the resistor value:\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 R (kΩ) =50\n50 ×VN EG D ES I RED − 0.815\n262 × 0.815 − VRE F− 1\nwhere:\nVNEGDESIRED  is the more negative voltage than the default.\nVREF  = 1.44 V.\nThis resistor is connected as shown in Figure 40 .\nFigure 40.

Resistor Used to Increase VNEG Above −2.46 V (Less Negative)\nIt is important to note that VNEG must always be set lower (more\nnegative) than the VGATE threshold voltage by at least 0.3 V to\n0.4 V to ensure a reliable startup. Therefore, the VGATE threshold\nvoltage cannot be equal to VNEG.\nCHANGING THE VGATE THRESHOLD\nVOLTAGE\nDuring startup, VGATE must first pull down to the threshold voltage\nbefore the control loop can start, to ensure that the RF amplifier\nis pinched off before asserting VDRAIN. By default, the VGATE\nthreshold voltage is approximately −2.06 V. In some cases, this\nthreshold voltage may need to be adjusted to safely bias the RF\namplifier, for example, when an amplifier requires gate voltages\nmore negative than −2 V to fully shut off, or when the absolute\nmaximum rating of an amplifier for VGATE is less negative than\n−2 V.\nThe VGATE threshold voltage can be adjusted using an external\nresistor. To set the threshold lower (more negative) than the default,\na resistor is connected between VGATEFB and VREF (Pin 12 and\nPin 10).

Also, note that\nthe VGGx pin of the depletion mode RF amplifier cannot tolerate\nvoltages below −2 V.\n1.Choose RSENSE  to set the HMC980LP4E  target drain current to\n450 mA.

Table 6  also\nshows the RDS_ON  value of the internal MOSFET with these\nswitch settings. In this case, RDS_ON  = 1.55 Ω.\n3.Calculate the voltage required on VDD to set the correct voltage\non VDRAIN when the correct current is being drawn.\n      VDD (V) = 10 V + (1.55 Ω × 450 mA) = 10.698 V ≈ 10.7 V\n4.Adjust the VNEGFB pin to set VNEG to −2 V. This resistor is\nplaced between VNEG (Pin 15) and VNEGFB (Pin 11), and has\na 1% tolerance.\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 R (kΩ) =262\n262 ×1.44 V − 0.815\n50 × 0.815 − − 2 V− 1\n          R (kΩ) = 1603.33 k Ω ≈ 1620 k Ω\n5.Setting VNEG to −2 V also requires that the VGATE threshold\nvalue be changed to maintain a buffer of 0.3 V to 0.4 V by\nplacing a resistor between VGATE (Pin 16) and VGATEFB (Pin\n12). This resistor has a 1% tolerance. Calculate the resistor\nvalue as follows:\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 R (kΩ) =262\n262 ×1.44 V − 0.815\n50 × 0.815 − − 1.7 V− 1\n          R (kΩ) = 867 k Ω ≈ 866 k Ω\nControlling a Depletion Mode RF Amplifier\nUsing an External Negative Voltage\nThe following steps describe how to design an HMC980LP4E  circuit\nfor controlling the bias current in a depletion mode RF amplifier\nusing an external negative voltage for VNEG (Pin 15). For this\nexample, assume that the amplifier requires 12 V for VDD, draws\n200 mA, and has two VGGx pins, one of which requires a positive\nvoltage of 6 V.\n1.Choose RSENSE  to set the HMC980LP4E  target drain current to\n200 mA.

This mode of operation is selected by setting\nthe voltage on the VNEGFB and VGATEFB pins. See Table 7  for\na full description. Figure 44  shows a typical circuit for biasing an en-\nhancement mode amplifier. The HMC980LP4E  does not allow theinternal negative voltage generator to work if enhancement mode\nis selected. Therefore, if VNEGFB is left floating while VGATEFB is\ngrounded, HMC980LP4E  stays in standby mode.\nEnsure that the proper mode of operation is selected before pow-\nering the HMC980LP4E  to avoid biasing the external amplifier\nincorrectly.\nRECOMMENDED HMC980LP4E CIRCUITS\nMany RF amplifier bias control circuits that use the HMC980LP4E\nhave been built and verified for reference. A list of these circuits is\navailable on the Analog Devices wiki. Although this list of circuits is\nextensive, it is not exhaustive. If a given RF amplifier is not included\nin this list, that does not mean that it cannot be actively biased\nusing the HMC980LP4E .\nFor more information about amplifier designs using the\nHMC980LP4E , visit wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/ac-\ntive-bias-controllers/hmc980 .\nFigure 44.

C | 20 of 25DAISY-CHAIN OPERATION\nThe HMC980LP4E  produces a logic high signal on the TRIGOUT\npin when the drain current of the external amplifier is in regulation.\nThis trigger signal can be used to enable additional HMC980LP4E\nchips in a chain of amplifiers, thereby allowing proper amplifier\nchain power sequencing using only a single enable signal. The\ntriggering sequence can be routed in any direction, from input to\noutput, or from output to input, depending on the requirement.\nFigure 45  shows an example of three HMC980LP4E  devices in an\namplification chain. Note that only the first HMC980LP4E  device\nin the chain uses the internal negative voltage generator. Subse-\nquent HMC980LP4E  devices use the negative voltage generated\nby the first HMC980LP4E . Also, note that the amplifier modes of\noperation have no bearing on the daisy-chaining of HMC980LP4E\nbias controllers. Generating the negative voltage from a single\nHMC980LP4E  reduces the number of the components in the design\nand decreases the overall current consumption of the system.HIGHER DRAIN CURRENT APPLICATIONS\nTwo or more HMC980LP4E  devices can be connected in parallel to\nbias amplifiers that require more current than the 1.6 A that a single\nHMC980LP4E  can provide.\nTo connect multiple HMC980LP4E  devices in parallel, tie all the\nISENSE pins together so that all the bias controllers are using the\nsame resistor for the current reference. Calculate the RSENSE  resis-\ntor value using the same equation as for a single HMC980LP4E .\nIf using the internal negative voltage generator, set up only\none HMC980LP4E  with the negative voltage generator, and the\nCP_OUT pin from that device drives the VNEG pins of all parallel\ndevices (up to 10 HMC980LP4E  devices).\nConnect the VDRAIN outputs from all the HMC980LP4E  devices\ntogether and apply them to the power supply pin of the amplifier\nunder control.\nFigure 45.

The ALML and ALMH pins (Pin\n21 and Pin 23) must be tied directly to the ISET pin (Pin 22). Pin 22\nstill requires a 5 k Ω resistor to ground.\nVNEG/VGATE Feedback Resistors\nDepending on the absolute maximum limits of the RF amplifier\nbeing biased, it is possible to eliminate the resistors used to limit\nthe range of VNEG and VGATE.\nAssuming the internal negative voltage generator is being used\n(see the Negative Voltage Generator  section) and the amplifier\nbeing biased can safely tolerate −2.46 V on the gate pin, Resistors\nR5, R6, R7, and R8 can be removed.\nVG2 Set Resistors\nIf the amplifier being biased requires only one gate control voltage,\nthe resistor divider used to set the voltage on VG2 (R3 and R4) can\nbe removed. The VG2_CONT and VG2 pins (Pin 13 and Pin 14)\nmust be left floating.\nNegative Voltage Generator\nIf the desired VNEG voltage is available externally, the negative\nvoltage generator can be disabled and the associated components\nremoved.
