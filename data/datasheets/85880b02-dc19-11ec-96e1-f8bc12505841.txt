The nominal input voltage range is 2.4 -5.0V. The output can be set to common pre -\nset voltages by connecting appropriate combinations of 3 voltage selection pins to ground. The feedback \ncontrol loop is a type III voltage -mode and the part uses a low- noise PWM topology. Up to 3A of output current \ncan b e drawn from this converter. The 5MHz operating frequency enables the use of small -size output \ncapacitors.  \n \n \n \nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN5336QI  \nPage 10   The power supply has the following protection features:  \n• Over -current protection (to protect the IC from excessive load current)  \n• Thermal shutdown w ith hysteresis  \n• Over -voltage protection  \n• Under -voltage lockout circuit to disable the converter output when the input voltage is less than \napproximately 2.2V  \nAdditional features include:  \n• Soft -start circuit, limiting the in -rush current when the converter is  powered up  \n• Power good circuit indicating whether the output voltage is within 90% - 120% of the programmed \nvoltage.  \nOutput Voltage Programming  \nThe EN5336QI output voltage is programmed using a simple resistor divider network. Figure 4 shows the \nresistor d ivider configuration.  \nThe EN5336QI output voltage and over voltage thresholds are determined by the voltages presented at the XFB and XOV pins respectively. These voltages are set by way of resistor dividers between V\nOUT and AGND \nwith the midpoint going to  XFB and XOV.  \nIt is recommended that Rb1 and Rb2 resistor values be ~2k Ω. Use the following equation to set the resistor \nRa1 for the desired output voltage:  \nVRb V VoutRa75.01 *) 75.0 (1−=  \nIf over -voltage protection is desired, use the following equation to set the  resistor Ra2 for the desired OVP \ntrip-point:  \nVRb V OVPtripRa90.02 *) 90.0 (2−=  \nBy design, if both resistor dividers are the same, the OV trip -point will be 20% above the nominal output \nvoltage.  \nXFB\nCSSVOUTPOK\nPGND AGNDSSPVIN\nAVIN\nXOVVOUTVIN\n22µF\n47µFRa1Ra2\nRb1 Rb2\n \nFigure 4:   VOUT an d OVP resistor divider ne tworks  \nNOTE: if no OVP divider is present, there will be no over -voltage protection and POK will remain \n“high” as long as V OUT remains above 90% of the nominal V OUT setting .  \n \n \nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN5336QI  \nPage 11   Input Capacitor Selection  \nThe EN5336QI requires about 20 μF of input capacitance. Low -cost, low -ESR ceramic capacitors should be \nused as input capacitors for this converter. The dielectric must be X5R or X7R rated. In some applications, \nlower value capacitors are needed in parallel with the larger, capacitors in order to provide high frequency \ndecoupling.  It is recommended to use 10V rated  MLCC capacitors. Table 2 lists some recommended part \nnumbers for input capacitors.  \nTable 2 : Recommended input capacitors  \nDescription  MFG  P/N \n10μF, 10V, 10%, X7R, 1206  \n(2 capacitors needed)  Murata  GRM31CR71A106KA01L  \nTaiyo Yuden  LMK316B7106KL -T \n22μF, 10V, 10%, X7R, 1210  \n(1 capacitor needed)  Murata  GRM32ER71A226KE20L  \nTaiyo Yuden  LMK325B7226KM -T \nOutput Capacitor Selection  \nThe EN533 6QI has been optimized for use with approximately 50μF of output capacitance.  Low ESR ceramic \ncapacitors are required with X5R or X7R rated dielectric formulation.  Y5V or equivalent dielectric formulations \nmust not be used as these lose capacitance with frequency, temperature and bias volt age. \nTable 3 : Typical ripple versus capacitance is given below  \nOutput Capacitor \nConfiguration  Typical Output Ripple (mVp- p) (as \nmeasured on EN533 6QI Evaluation Board)  \n1 x 47 μ F 30 \n3 x 22 μ F 15 \nOutput ripple voltage is determined by the aggregate output capacitor impedance.  Output impedance, denoted as Z, is comprised of effective series resistance, ESR, and effective series inductance, ESL:  \nZ = ESR + ESL  \nPlacing output capacitors in parallel reduces the impedance and will hence result in lower ripple voltage.  \nn Total Z Z Z Z1...1 1 1\n2 1+++=  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN5336QI  \nPage 12   Table 4: Recommended output capacitors  \nDescription  MFG  P/N \n22μF, 6.3V, 10%, X5R, 1206  \n(3 capacitors needed)  Murata  GRM31CR60J226KE19L  \nTaiyo Yuden  JMK316BJ226KL -T \n47μF, 10V, 10%, X5R, 1210  \n47μF, 6.3V, 10%, X5R, 1210  \n(1 capacitor needed)  Murata  GRM32ER61A476KE20L  \nAVX  12106D476KAT2A  \nEnable Operation  \nThe ENABLE pin provides a means to shut down the device, or  enable normal operation. A logic high will enable \nthe converter into normal operation.  When the ENABLE pin is asserted, the device will undergo a normal soft \nstart. A logic low will disable the converter and cause it to shut down. When Enable goes low, c ircuitry internal \nto the device continue to operate to ensure the output voltage is gradually returned to zero and the circuits \nturn off subsequently. A short low going pulse on Enable is ignored.  \nSoft -Start Operation  \nSoft start is a method to reduce in -rush current when the device is enabled. The output voltage is ramped up \nslowly upon start- up.    The output rise time is controlled by choice of a soft -start capacitor, which is placed \nbetween the SS pin (pin 37) and the AGND pin (pin 29).   \nRise Time:  T R = C ss* 75KΩ \nDuring start -up of the converter, the reference voltage to the error amplifier is gradually  increased from zero \nto its final level by an internal current source of typically 10uA. Typical soft -start rise time is 1mS to 3mS.  The \nrise time is measured from the time when AVIN > V UVLO and the Enable signal crosses its logic high threshold. \nTypical SS capacitor values are in the range of 15nF to 50 nF.  \nPower -Up/Down  Sequencing  \nThe sequencing of AVIN, PVIN and ENABLE should meet the following requirements:  \n1. ENABLE should not be asserted before PVIN.  \n2. PVIN should not be applied before AVIN.  \nNote that tying AVIN, PVIN and ENABLE together and brought up at the same time does meet these \nrequirements.  \nPOK Operation  \nThe POK signal is an open drain signal from the converter indicating the output voltage is within the specified \nrange. The POK signal will be a logic high when the output voltage is above 90% of  VOUT and below the user \nprogrammed OVP trip -point. If the output voltage goes outside of this range,  the POK signal will be a logic low \nuntil the output voltage has returned to within this range. In the event of an over -voltage condition the POK \nsignal will go low and will remain in this condition until the output voltage has dropped to 95% of the progra mmed output voltage before returning to the high state.  \nNOTE : If no over voltage protection is used, POK will remain “high” as long as V\nOUT remains above 90% of the \nnominal V OUT setting.  \nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN5336QI  \nPage 13   Over -Current Protection  \nThe current limit function is achieved by se nsing the current flowing through the sense P -MOSFET.  When the \nsensed current exceeds the current limit, both NFET and PFET switches are turned off. If the over -current \ncondition is removed, the over -current protection circuit will enable the PWM operatio n. This circuit is \ndesigned to provide high noise immunity.  \nThe nominal over current trip point is set to 4.5A. It is possible to increase the over -current set point by about \n50% by connecting a 7.5k Ω resistor between ROCP (pin 27) and GND. The typical vol tage at the ROCP pin is \n0.75V.  \nIn some cases, such as the start -up of FPGA devices, it is desirable to blank the over -current protection feature. \nIn order to disable over -current protection, the ROCP pin should be tied to any voltage between 2.5V and \nPVIN . \nOver -Voltage Protection  \nWhen the output voltage exceeds 120% of the programmed output voltage, the PWM operation stops, the \nlower N -MOSFET is turned on and the POK signal goes low. When the output voltage drops below 95% of the \nprogrammed output voltage,  normal PWM operation resumes and POK returns to its high state.  \nThermal Overload Protection  \nThermal shutdown will disable operation once the Junction temperature exceeds approximately 150 °C. Once \nthe junction temperature drops by approx 25 °C, the converte r will re -start with a normal soft- start.  \nInput Under -voltage Lock -out  \nCircuitry is provided to ensure that when the input voltage is below the specified voltage range, the converter \nwill not start -up. Circuits for hysteresis, input de -glitch and output l eading edge blanking are included to \nensure high noise immunity and prevent false tripping.  \nCompensation \nThe EN533 6QI is internally compensated through the use of a type 3 compensation network and is optimized \nfor use with about 50μF of output capacitance and will provide excellent loop bandwidth and transient \nperformance for most applications. (See the section on Capacitor Selection  for details on recommended \ncapacitor types.) Voltage mode operation provides high noise immunity at light load.  \nIn some case s modifications to the compensation may be required.

Please see the Gerber files on the Intel  website www.intel.com/enpirion  for exact \ndimensions and other layers.  Please refer to Figure 4 while reading the layou t recommendations in this section.  \n \nFigure 4: Optimized Layout Recommendations  \nRecommendation 1:  Input and output filter capacitors should be placed on the same side of the PCB, and as \nclose to the EN533 6QI package as possible. They should be connected to  the device with very short and wide \ntraces. Do not use thermal reliefs or spokes when connecting the capacitor pads to the respective nodes. The \n+V and GND traces between the capacitors and the EN533 6QI should be as close to each other as possible so \nthat the gap between the two nodes is minimized, even under the capacitors.  \nRecommendation 2: Two PGND pins are dedicated to the input circuit, and two to the output circuit. The slit \nin Figure 4 separating the input and output GND circuits helps minimize nois e coupling between the converter \ninput and output switching loops.  \nRecommendation 3: The system ground plane should be the first layer immediately below the surface layer. \nThis ground plane should be continuous and un -interrupted below the converter and th e input/output \ncapacitors. Please see the Gerber files on the Intel website www.intel.com/enpirion . \nRecommendation 4 : The large thermal pad underneath the component must be connected to the system \nground plane through as many vias as possible.  The drill diameter of the vias should be 0.33mm , and the vias \nmust have at least 1 oz. copper plating on the inside wall, making  the finished hole size around 0.20 -0.26mm . \nDo not use thermal reliefs or spokes to connect the vias to the ground plane. This connection provides the \npath for heat dissipation from the converter. Please see Figures: 5 , 6, and 7. \nRecommendation 5 : Multiple  small vias (the same size as the thermal vias discussed in recommendation 4 \nshould be used to connect ground terminal of the input capacitor and output capacitors to the system ground \nplane. It is preferred to put these vias under the capacitors along the  edge of the GND copper closest to the \n+V copper. Please see Figure 4. These vias connect the input/output filter capacitors to the GND plane, and help reduce parasitic inductances in the input and output current loops. If the vias cannot be placed under C\nIN \nand C OUT, then put them just outside the capacitors along the GND slit separating the two components. Do not \nuse thermal reliefs or spokes to connect these vias to the ground plane.  \n\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN5336QI  \nPage 15   Recommendation 6 : AVIN is the power supply for the internal small -signal control circuits. It should be \nconnected to the input voltage at a quiet point. In Figure 4 this connection is made at the input capacitor close \nto the V IN connection.  \nRecommendation 7 : The layer 1 metal under the device must not be more than shown in Figure 4. See the \nsection regarding exposed metal on bottom of package. As with any switch -mode DC -DC converter, try not to \nrun sensitive signal or control lines underneath the converter package on other layers.  \nRecommendation 8:  The external feedback resistor sense point (top feedback resistor) should be just after \nthe last output filter capacitor. Keep the sense trace as short as possible in order to avoid noise coupling into the control loop. Place the feedback resistor components near the XFB pin. The ground for the external \nfeedback resistor should be connected to a quiet ground such as AGND.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN5336QI  \nPage 16   DESIGN CONSIDERATION S FOR LEAD -FRAME BAS ED MODULES  \nExposed Metal on Bottom of Package  \nLead frame offers many advantages in thermal performance, in reduced electrical lead resistance, and in \noverall foot print.  However, they do require some special considerations.  \nIn the assembly process lead frame construction requires that, for mechanica l support, some of the lead -frame \ncantilevers be exposed at the point where wire -bond or internal passives are attached.  This results in several \nsmall pads being exposed on the bottom of the package.  \nOnly the large thermal pad and the perimeter pads are t o be mechanically or electrically connected to the PC \nboard. The PCB top layer under the EN533 6QI should be clear of any metal except for the large thermal pad.  \nThe “grayed -out” area in Figure 5 represents the area that should be clear of any metal (trace s, vias, or planes), \non the top layer of the PCB . Figure 6 shows the recommended PCB footprint for this device.  \n \n \nFigure 5.  Lead -Frame exposed metal.
