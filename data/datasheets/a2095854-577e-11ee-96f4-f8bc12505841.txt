Product Characteristic D ata \n \n2-1. Capacitance  \n \nThe capacitance  is the ratio of the change  in an electric charge according to voltage change.  \nDue to the fact that the capacitance may be subject to change with the measured voltage and \nfrequency, it is highly recommended to measure the capacitance based on the following \nconditions.  \n  \n2-1-1. Measure Capacitance with V oltage an d Frequency Specified in this D ocument.  \nRegarding the voltage/frequency condition for capacitance measurement  of each MLCC model,  \nplease make sure to follow  a section “ C.

(Class II)  \n \n2-1-2. It is Recommended to use Measurement E quipment with the ALC (Auto Level Control) Option.  \n      The Reason is that when Capacitance or Meas urement Frequency is high, the o utput V oltage of \n      Measurement E quipment  can be lower than the Setting V oltage due to the  Equipment limitation . \n      Note that when Capacitance or Measurement F requency is e xcessively high, the M easurement  \n      Equipment may show ALC off Warning and p rovide a  lower Output voltage than the S etting  \n      Voltage even with ALC Option selected. It is necessary to ensure the output voltage  of \n      Measurement E quipment is t he Same as the Setting Volt age before Measuring C apacitance.  \n \n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-1-3. Capacitance Value of High Dielectric C onstant (Class II) MLCC Changes with A pplied AC and DC  \n      Voltage. Therefore, it is Necessary to take into Account MLCC’s AC voltage C haracteristics and DC - \n      Bias voltage Characteristics when Applying MLCC to the Actual C ircuit. \n \n2-1-4. The Capacitance is in C ompliance with the EIA RS -198-1-F-2002. \n \n \n2-2. Tan δ  (DF) \n \n2-2-1. An ideal MLCC’s Energy Loss is Z ero, but Real MLCC has Dielectric Loss and Resistance Loss of  \nElectrode. DF (Dissipation Factor) is Defined as the Ratio of Loss Energy to Stored E nergy and \nTypically B eing Calculated as Percentage.  \n \n2-2-2. Quality Factor (Q factor) is d efined as the Ratio of Stored Energy to Loss E nergy.   \n      The Equation can be described as 1/DF.  Normally the loss C haracteristic of Class I MLCC i s  \n      Presented  in Q, since the DF valu e is so small whereas the loss C haracteristic of Class II MLCC is  \n      Presented  in DF. \n \n2-2-3. It is Recommended to use Class I MLCC for A pplications to Require Good Linearity and Low L oss   \nSuch as Coupling Circuit, Filter Circuit and Time C onstant Circuit. \n \n \n2-3. Insulation Resistance  \n \nCeramic D ielectric has a Low Leakage Current with DC V oltage due to  the High Insulating \nProperties.  lnsulation Resistance is Defined as the R atio of  a Leakage Current to DC V oltage.  \n \n2-3-1.

Capacitance Aging \n \nThe aging characteristic is that the high dielectric (Class II) MLCC decreases capacitance  \nvalue over time.  It is also necessary to consider the aging characteristic with voltage and  \ntemperature characteristics when Class II MLCC is used in circuitry . \n \n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-4-1. In General, Aging C auses Capacitance to Decrease L inearly with the log of Time as S hown in the  \n      Following G raph. Please Check with SEMCO for more D etails, Since the Value may V ary Between  \n      Different M odels.  \n \n2-4-2. After H eat Treatment (15 0 °C, 1hour), the Capacitance Decreased by Aging is Recovered, so Aging \nShould be Considered Again from the Time of Heat T reatment.  \n \n[ Example of Capacitance Aging ]  \n* Sample : C0G, X7R, X5R  \n \n \n2-5. Temperature Characteristics of Capacitance (TCC)  \n \nPlease  consider temperature characteristics of capacitance since the electrica l characteristics such as \ncapacitance changes  which is caused by a change in ceramic dielectric constant  by temperature.  \n \n2-5-1. It is Necessary to Check the Values Specified in S ection “ C. Reliability test Condition –Temperature  \nCharacteristics” for the Temperature and Capacitance Change R ange of MLCC.  \n \n   \n[ Example of Temperature Characteristics (X5R) ]             [ Example of Bias TCC ]  \n* Sample :  10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V       * Sample : 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-5-2. When Selecting MLCC, it is Necessary to Consider the Heat C haracteristics of a System, Room  \n      Temperature and TCC of MLCC , since the Applied T emperature  may C hange the Capacitance of  \n      MLCC. \n \n2-5-3. In A ddition, Bias TCC of MLCC  Should be taken into Account when DC Voltage is a pplied to MLCC.  \n \n \n2-6. Self-heating Temperature  \n \nIt is necessary to design the system, with considering self-heating generated  by the ESR \n(Equivalent Series Resistance) of MLCC  when AC voltage or pulse voltage is applied to MLCC.  \n \n \n2-6-1. When MLCC is used in an AC Voltage or Pulse Voltage Circuit, self -heating is G enerated when AC  \n     or Pulse C urrent flows through MLCC. Short -circuit may  be Occurred by the Degradation of MLCC’s  \n      Insulating properties.  \n \n2-6-2. The Reliability of MLCC may be A ffected  by MLCC Being used in an  AC Voltage or P ulse Voltage  \n      Circuit, even the AC Voltage or  the Pulse Voltage is w ithin the Range of Rated V oltage.  \n      Therefore, make sure to check the Following C onditions.  \n \n1) The Surface Temperature of MLCC Must Stay Within the Maximum Operating T emperature after  \n  AC or Pulse V oltage is applied.   \n \n2) The Rise in Increase by S elf-heating of MLCC Must not Exceed 20℃  \n \n \n[ Example of Ripple current ]  \n* Sample : X5R 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n \n \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-7. DC & AC V oltage Characteristics  \n \nIt is required to consider voltage characteristics in the circuit since the capacitance value of high \ndielectric constant MLCC( Class II) is changed by applied DC & AC voltage.  \n \n2-7-1. Please E nsure the Capacitance Change is W ithin the Allowed Operating R ange of a System . In   \n      Particular, w hen High Dielectric Constant Type MLCC (Class II) is used in C ircuit with N arrow \nallowed  \n      Capacitance T olerance , a System Should be D esigned with Consider ing DC Voltage, T emperature  \n      Characteristics and Aging Characteristics  of MLCC.  \n \n \n[ Example of DC Bias characteristics  ] \n* Sample : X5R 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n \n2-7-2. It is N ecessary to Consider the AC Voltage C haracteristics of MLCC and the AC V oltage of  \na System ,      \n      Since the Capacitance V alue of High Dielectric Constant Type MLCC (Class II) Varies with the \nApplied AC voltage.  \n \n \n[ Example of AC voltage characteristics  ] \n* Sample : X5R 10uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n2-8. Impedance Characteristic  \n \nElectrical impedance (Z) of MLCC is the measurement of the opposition that MLCC presents to a \ncurrent (I) when a voltage (V) is applied. It is defined as the ratio of the voltage to the current \n(Z=V/I). Impedance extends the concept of resistance to AC circuits and is a complex number \nconsisting of the real part of resistance (R) and the imaginary part of reactance (X) as Z=R+jX.  \nTherefore, it is required to design cir cuit with consideration of the impedance characteristics of \nMLCC based on  the frequency ( Z = R + jX )  \n \n2-8-1. MLCC Operates as a Capacitor in the low Frequency and its Reactance (XC) Decreases as \nFrequency  \nincreases ( X_C=1/j2πfC  ) where f is frequency and C is capacitance.  \nThe resistance (ESR;  Equivalent Series Resistance) of MLCC in the low frequency mainly comes  \nfrom the loss of its  dielectric material.  \n \n2-8-2. MLCC operates as an inductor in the high frequency and the inductan ce of MLCC is called ESL  \n(Equivalent Series Inductance). The reactance (XL) of MLCC in the high frequency increases as  \nfrequency increases ( X_L=j2πf∙ESL ). The resistance (ESR) of MLCC in the high frequency mainly  \ncomes from the loss of its electrode meta l. \n \n2-8-3. SRF (Self Resonant Frequency) of MLCC is the frequency where its capacitive reactance (XC) and  \ninductive reactance(XL) cancel each other and the impedance of MLCC has only ESR at SRF.  \n \n \n2-8-4. The impedance of MLCC can be measured by a network  analyzer or an impedance analyzer.   \n      When using the network analyzer, please note that the small -signal input may lead to the \n      impedance of low capacitance caused by  the AC voltage characteristic of MLCC.  \n \n \n[ Example of Impedance  characteristics  ] \n* Sample : X5R 1uF, Rated voltage 6.3V  \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n3. Electrical & Mechanical  Caution  \n \n3-1. Derating  \n \n3-1-1. The D erated MLCC Should be Applied with the Derating Voltage and Temperature as Shown in \nthe Following G raph. \n \n3-1-2.

Applied Voltage  \n \nThe actual applied voltage on MLCC should not exceed the rated voltage set in the specifications.  \n3-2-1. Cautions by Types of Voltage A pplied to MLCC   \n \n· For DC voltage or DC+AC voltage, DC voltage or the maximum value of DC + AC  voltage s hould  \n  not exceed the rated voltage of MLCC.  \n· For AC voltage or pulse voltage, the peak -to-peak value of AC voltage or pulse voltage  \nshould not exceed the rated voltage of MLCC.  \n· Abnormal voltage such as surge voltage, static electricity should not exceed the rated voltage o f \nMLCC.  \n \n[Types of Voltage Applied to the Capacitor]  \nDC Voltage  AC Voltage  DC+AC Voltage 1  DC+AC Voltage 2  DC+Pulse Voltage  \n     \n \n3-2-2. Effect of EOS (Electrical Overstress)  \n \n· Electrical Overstress such as a surge voltage  or EOS can cause damage s to MLCC, resulting in \nthe electrical short failure caused by the dielectric breakdown in MLCC.  \n· Down time of MLCC is varied with the applied voltage and the room temperature  and a \ndielectric  shock caused by EOS can accelerate heating on the dielectric . Therefore, it can bring \nabout a failure of MLCC in a market at the early stage.  \n· Please use caution not to apply excessive electrical overstress including spi ke voltage MLCC when \npreparing MLCC for testing or evaluating.  \n \n(1) Surge  \nWhen the overcurrent caused by surge is applied to MLCC, the influx of current into MLCC can \ninduce the overshooting phenomenon of voltage as shown in the graph below and result in the \nelectrical short failure in MLCC. Therefore , it is necessary to be care ful to prevent the influx of \nsurge current into MLCC.  \n \n(2) ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)  \n \nSince the voltage of the static electricity is very high but the quantity of electric charge is small \ncompared to the surge, ESD can cause damage to MLCC with low ca pacitance as shown in the \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \nfollowing graph, whereas surge with lots of electric charge quantity can cause damages to even \nhigh capacitance MLCC.  \n \n   \n[ Example of Surge applied to MLCC ]             [ Example of ESD applied to MLCC ]  \n* Simulation for ESD 8kV \n \n \n3-3. Vibration  \n \n      Please check the types of vibration  and shock , and the status of resonance.  \n      Manage MLCC not to generate resonance and avoid any kind of  impact to terminals.  \n      When MLCC  is used in a vibration environment, please make sure to contact us for the situation  \n      and conside r special MLCC such as Soft -term, etc.  \n \n \n3-4. Shock \n \nMechanical stress caused by  a drop may cause damages to a dielectric or a crack in MLCC \nDo not use a dropped MLCC to avoid any quality and reliability deterioration.  \nWhen piling up or handling printed circuit boards, do not hit MLCC with the corners of a PCB to \nprevent cracks or any other damages to the MLCC.  \n \n \n3-5. Piezo -electric Phenomenon  \n \nMLCC may generate a noise due to vibration at specific frequency when using the high dielectric \nconstant MLCC (Class Ⅱ) at AC or Pulse circuits.  \nMLCC may cause a noise if MLCC is affected by any mechanical vibrations or shocks.  \n \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4. Process of Mounting  and Soldering  \n \n4-1. Mounting  \n \n4-1-1. Mounting  Position  \nIt is recommended to locate the major axis of MLCC in parallel to the direction in which the stress  \nis applied.  \n \n \nNot recommended                           Recommended  \n \n4-1-2. Cautions During M ounting Near the C utout \nPlease take the following measures to effectively reduce the stress generated from the cutting of  \nPCB. Select the mounting location shown below , since the mechanical stress is affected by a   \nlocation and a direction of MLCC mounted near the cutting line.  \n \n \n \n4-1-3. Cautions During Mounting Near S crew \nIf MLCC is mounted near a screw hole, the board deflection  may be occurred  by screw torque.  \nMount MLCC as far from the screw hole s as possible . \n \n \nNot recommended        Recommended  \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-2. Caution  before Mounting  \n \n4-2-1. It is recommended to store and use MLCC in a reel. Do not re -use MLCC that was isolated from  \nthe reel.  \n4-2-2. Check the capacitance characteristics under actual applied voltage.  \n4-2-3. Check the mechanical stress when actual process and equipment is in use.  \n4-2-4. Check the rated capacitance, rated voltage and other electrical characteristics before assembly.  \n     Heat treatment must be done prior to measurement of capacitance.  \n4-2-5. Check the solderability of MLCC that has passed shelf life befor e use.  \n4-2-6. The use of Sn -Zn based solder may deteriorate the reliability of MLCC.  \n \n \n4-3. Cautions d uring Mounting with Mounting (pick -and-place) Machines  \n \n4-3-1. Mounting Head Pressure  \nExcessive pressure may cause cracks in MLCC. \nIt is recommended to adjust the nozzle pressure within the maximum value of 300g.f.  \nAdditional conditions must be set for both thin film and special purpose MLCC.  \n4-3-2. Bending Stress  \nWhen using a two-sided sub strate, it is required to mount MLCC on one side first before \nmounting on the other  side due to the bending of the substrate caused by the mounting head . \nSupport the substrate as shown in the picture below when MLCC is mounted on the other side.  \nIf the substrate is not supported, bending of the substrate may cause cracks  in MLCC.  \n \n \n \n4-3-3. Suction N ozzle \nDust accumulated in a suction nozzle and suction mechanism can impede a smo oth movement of \nthe nozzle.  This may cause cracks in MLCC due to the excessive force during mounting.  \nIf the mounting claw is worn out,  it may ca use cracks in  MLCC due to the uneven force during \npositioning.  \n A regular inspection such as maintenance, monitor and replace ment for the suction nozzle and  \n mounting claw should be conducted.  \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-4. Reflow Soldering  \n \nMLCC is in a direct contact with the dissolved solder during soldering, which may be exposed to \npotential mechanical stress caused by the sudden temperature change.  \nTherefore, MLCC may be contaminated by the location movement and flux.   \nFor the reason, the mounting pro cess must be closely monitored . \n \nMethod  Classification  \nReflow soldering  Overall heating  Infrared rays  \nHot plate  \nVPS(Vapor phase)  \nLocal heating  Air heater  \nLaser \nLight beam  \n \n4-4-1. Reflow Profile  \n \n[Reflow Soldering Conditions]  \n \nUse caution not to exceed the peak temperature (260℃) and time (30sec) as shown.  \nPre-heating is necessary for all constituents including the PCB to prevent the mechanical damages  \non MLCC. The temperature difference between the PCB and the component surface must be ke pt  \nto the minimum . \n \n      As for reflow soldering, it is recommended to keep the number o f reflow soldering to less than  \n      three times. Please check with us when the number of reflow soldering needs to exceed three  \n      times. Care must be exercised  especially for the ultra -small size,  thin film and high capacitance  \n      MLCC as they can be affected by thermal stress more easily.  \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-4-2. Reflow Temperature  \nThe following quality problem may occur when MLCC is mounted with a lower temperature than \nthe reflow temperature recommended by a solder manufacturer.  The specified peak temperature \nmust be maintained after taking into consideration the factors such as the placement of \nperipheral  constituent and the reflow temperature.  \n \n･Drop in solder wettability  \n･Solder voids  \n･Potential occurrence of whisker  \n･Drop in adhesive strength  \n･Drop in self -alignment properties  \n･Potential occurrence of tombstones  \n \n4-4-3. Cooling  \nNatural cooling with air is recommended . \n \n4-4-4. Optimum Solder Flux for Reflow S oldering  \n· Overly the thick application of solder pastes results in an excessive solder fillet height.  \n  This makes MLCC more vulnerable to the mechanical and thermal stress from the board, which  \n  may cause cracks in MLCC.  \n· Too little solder paste results in a lac k of the adhesive strength, which may cause MLCC to \nisolate from PCB  \n· Check if solder has been applied uniformly after solderin g is completed.  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n· It is required  to design a PCB with consideration of a solder land pattern and its size to apply an  \n appropriate  amount of solder to MLCC. The amount of the solder at the edge may impact  \n directly on cracks in MLCC.  \n \n· The design of a suitable solder land is necessary since the more the solder amount is,  \n  the larger the force MLCC experiences and the higher the chance MLCC cracks.  \n \n \nToo Much Solder  \nlarge stress may cause cracks  Not enough solder  \nWeak holding force may cause bad \nconnections or detaching of the capacitor  \n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-5.

Caution before Flow S oldering  \n \n· When a sudden heat is applied to MLCC, the mechanical rigidity of MLCC is deteriorated by the \ninternal deformation of MLCC. Preheating all the constituents including PCB is required to prevent \nthe mechanical damages on MLCC.  The temperature difference between the solder and the \nsurface of MLCC must be kept to the  minimum.  \n \n· If the flow time is too long or the flow temperature is too high,  the adhesive strength with PCB \nmay be deteriorated by the leaching phenomenon of the outer termination , or the capacitance \nvalue may be dropped by weak adhesion between the internal termination  and the outer \ntermination.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-6. Soldering Iron  \n \nManual soldering can pose a great risk on creating thermal cracks in MLCC.  The high temperature  \nsoldering iron t ip may come into a direct contact with the ceramic body of MLCC  due to the  \ncarelessness of an operator. Therefore, the soldering iron must be handled carefully,  and close  \nattention must be paid to the selection of  the soldering iron tip and to temperature control of the  \ntip. \n \n4-6-1. How to u se a S oldering Iron  \n· In order to minimize damages on M LCC, preheating MLCC and PCB is necessary.  \n  A hot plate and a hot air type preheater should be used for preheating  \n. Do not cool down MLCC and PCB rapidly after soldering.  \n· Keep the contact time between the outer termination of MLCC and the soldering iron as short as  \n  possible.

Caution s for Soldering  \n· Too much solder amount will increase the risk of PCB bending or cause other damages.  \n· Too little solder amount will result in MLCC breaking loose from the PCB due to the \ninadequate adhesive strength.  \n· Check if the solder has been applied properly and e nsure the solder fillet has a proper shape.  \n \n \n* Soldering wire below ø0.5mm is required for soldering . \n \n \n4-7. Cleaning  \n \n4-7-1. In General , Cleaning is Unnecessary if R osin Flux is u sed. \nWhen acidic flux is used  strongly , chlorine in the flux may dissolve into some types of cleaning \nfluids, thereby affecting the performance of MLCC.  \nThis means that the cleansing solution must be carefully selected and should always be new.  \n \n4-7-2. Cautions for Cleaning  \n      MLCC or solder joint may be cracked with the vibration of PCB, if ult rasonic vibration is too strong  \n      during cleaning. When high pressure cleaning equipment is used, test should be done for the  \n      cleaning equipment and its process before the cleaning in order to avoid damages on MLCC.  \n \n \n \n  \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-8. Cautions for Using Electrical M easuring Probes  \n \n· Confirm the position of the support pin or jig when checking the electrical performance of MLCC  \n  after mounting on the PCB.  \n· Watch for PCB bending caused by the pressure of a test -probe or other equipment.  \n· If the PCB is bent by the force from the test probe, MLCC may be cracked or the solder joint may  \n  be damaged.  \n· Avoid PCB flexing by using the support pin on the back side of the PCB.  \n· Place equip ment with the support pin as close to the test -probe as possible.   \n· Prevent shock vibration s of the board when the test-probe  contacts a PCB.  \n \n \nNot recommended                               Recommended  \n \n \n4-9. Printed Circuit Board  Cropping  \n \n· Do not apply any stress to MLCC such as bending or twisting the board after mounting MLCC  \non the PCB.  \n· The stress as shown may cause cracks in MLCC when cutting the board.  \n· Cracked MLCC may cause degradation to the insulation resistance, thereby causing short circuit.  \n· Avoid these types of stresses applied to MLCC.  \n \n             [Bending]                                  [Twisting]  \n \n \n4-9-1. Cautions for Cutting PCB  \nCheck a cutting  method of PCB in advance . \n \nThe high density board is separated into many individual board s after the completion of soldering.  \nIf the board is bent or deformed during separation, MLCC may  be cracked. \nCarefully select a separation method that minimizes the deformation of the PCB.  \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-10. Assembly Handling  \n \n4-10-1. Cautions for PCB H andling  \nHold the edges of the board mounted with MLCC with both hands since holding wi th one hand  \nmay bend the board.  \nDo not use dropped boards , which may degrade  the qua lity of MLCC . \n \n4-10-2. Mounting other Components  \nPay attention to the following conditions  when mounting other components on the back side of  \nThe board after MLCC has been mounted on the front side.  \nWhen the suction nozzle is placed too close to the board, board deflection stress may be  \napplied to MLCC on the back side , resulting in cracks in MLCC. \nCheck if proper value is set on each chip mounter for a suction location, a mounting gap and a \nsuction gap by the thickness of component s. \n \n \n \n4-10-3. Board M ounting Components with L eads  \n If the board is bent when inserting components (transformer, IC, etc.) into it, MLCC or solder  \njoint may be cracked . \n \nPay attention to the following:  \n· Reduce the stress on the board during insertion by increasing the size of the lead insertion  \n  hole. \n· Insert components with leads  into the board  after fixing the board with support pins or a  \n  dedicated jig.  \n· Support the bottom side of the board to avoid bending the board.  \n· Check the status of the height of each support pin regularly when the support pins are used.  \n \n \nNot recommended                            Recommended  \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n4-10-4. Socket and / or Connector A ttach / D etach \nSince the insertion or removal from sockets and connectors may cause the board to ben t, make \nsure that MLCC mounted on the board should not be damaged in this process.  \n \n \n \n4-10-5. Fastening S crew \nWhen attaching a shield on a board , the board may be bent during a screw tightening  work \n \nPay attention to the following conditions  before performing the work.   \n· Plan the work to prevent the board from bending  \n· Use a torque driver to prevent over -tightening of the screw.  \n· Since the board may  be bent by soldering,  use caution in tightening the screw.  \n \n \n4-11. Adhesive S election  \n \nPay attention to the following if a n adhesive is used to position MLCC on the board before   \nsoldering.  \n \n4-11-1. Requirements for Adhesives  \n· They must have enough adhesive strength to prevent MLCC from slipping or moving during  \n  the handling  the board . \n· They must maintain their adhesive strength when exposed to soldering temperatures.  \n· They should not spread when applied to the PCB.  \n        · They should have a long pot life.  \n· They should hardened quickly.  \n        · They should not corrode the board or MLCC material s. \n · They should be an i nsulator  type that does not affect the characteristic of MLCC . \n        · They should be non -toxic, not harmful, and particularly safe when workers touch the \nadhesives.  \n \n4-11-2. Caution before  Applying  Adhesive  \nCheck the  correct  application conditions before attaching MLCC to the board with an adhesive.    \nIf the dimension  of land, the type of adhesive s, the amount of coating, the contact surface area s, \n\n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \nthe curing temperature, or other condition s are not appropriate, it may degrade  the MLCC \nperformance . \n \n4-11-3. Cautions for S electing Adhesive  \nDepending on the type of the chosen adhesive, MLCC insulation resistance may be degrade d. \nIn addition, MLCC may be cracked by the difference in contractile stress caused by the different \ncontraction rate between  MLCC and the adhesive.  \n \n4-11-4. Cautions for  the Amount of Applied A dhesive and Curing Temperature  \n· The ina ppropriate  amount of the adhesive cause the weak adhesive strength , resulting in the a  \n  mounting defect  in MLCC  \n· Excessive use of the adhesive may cause a soldering defect, loss of electrical connection,  \n  incorrect curing, or slippage of a mounting position, thereby an inflow of the adhesive onto a  \n  land section s hould be avoided . \n   · If the curing temperature is too high or the curing time is too long, the adhesive strength will  \n     be degraded. In addition, oxidation both on the outer termination (Sn) of MLCC and the  \n     surface of the board ma y deteriorate the solderability . \n \n \n4-12. Flux  \n \n4-12-1. The Excessive Amount of Flux Generates Excessive Flux Gases Which may D eteriorate \nSolderability . Therefore, Apply the Flux thin and Evenly as a W hole. \n4-12-2. Flux  with a  High Ratio of Halogen may O xidize the Outer Termination  of MLCC, if Cleaning is not \nDone P roperly. Therefore, u se Flux with a Halogen Content of 0.1% M ax. \n4-12-3. Strong A cidic Flux can Degrade the  MLCC P erformance  \n4-12-4. Check the Solder Quality of MLCC and the A mount of R emaining Flux S urrounding MLCC after \nthe Mounting  Process.  \n \n \n4-13. Coating  \n \n4-13-1. Crack C aused by Coating  \nA crack may be caused in the MLCC due to amount of the resin and stress of thermal  \ncontraction of the resin during coating process.  \nDuring the coating process, the amount of resin and the stress of thermal contraction of the  \nresin may cause cracks in MLCC  \n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \nThe difference of thermal expansion coefficient between the coating , or a molding resin may \ncause destruction, deterioration of ins ulation resistance or dielectric breakdown of MLCC such \nas crack s or detachment,  etc. \n \n4-13-2. Recommended Coating M aterial  \n· A thermal expansion coefficient should be as close to that of MLCC as possible.  \n· A silicone resin can be used as an under -coating to buffer the stress . \n· The resin should have a minimum curing contraction rate.  \n· The resin should have a minimum sensitivity (ex. Epoxy resin).  \n· The insulation resistance of MLCC can be deteriorate d if a high hygroscopic property resin is \nused in a high humidity condition.  \n· Do not use strong acid substance s due to the fact that  coating material s inducing a family of \nhalogen substance s and organic acid may corrode MLCC.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nMLCC Product Manual  \n \n \n5.  Design  \n \n5-1. Circuit D esign \n \nWhen the board is dropped or bent, MLCC mounted on the board may be short -circuited by the  \ndrop in insulation resistance. Therefore, it is required to install safety equipment such as a fuse to  \nprevent additional accidents when MLCC is short -circuited, otherwise, electric short and fire may  \noccur. This product is not a safety guaranteed produc t.. \n \n \n \n5-2. PCB Design  \n \n5-2-1. Unlike Lead Type C omponents,  SMD Type C omponents that are Designed to be M ounted Directly  \n      on the Board are Fragile to the S tress. In Addition, they are More Sensitive to M echanical and  \n      Thermal Stress Than L ead Type Components.  \n \n \n5-2-2. MLCC C rack by PCB Material T ype \nA great difference of the thermal expansion coefficient betwe en PCB and MLCC causes thermal  \nexpansion and contraction, resulting in cracks in MLCC. Even though MLCC is mounted on a  \nboard with a fluorine resin or on a single -layered glass epoxy, cracks in MLCC may occur.  \n \n \n \n5-3. Design System E valuation  \n \n5-3-1. Evaluate the Actual Design With MLCC to Make Sure T here is n o Functional Issue or Violation of \nSpecification s of the F inished Goods. \n \n5-3-2. Please Note that the Capacitance May Differ Based on the Operating Condition of the Actual \nSystem  Since Class 2 MLCC Capacitance Varies with Applied Voltage and T emperature.  \n \n5-3-3. Surge Resistance Must be Evaluated Since the Excessive Surge Caused b y the I nductance of the  \n      Actual System may A pply to MLCC . \n \n5-3-4.
