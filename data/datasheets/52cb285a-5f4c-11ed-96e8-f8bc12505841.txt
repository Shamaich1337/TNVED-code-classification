With a wide input range from 4.3 V \nto 60 V, it is suitable for various applications from industrial to automotive for power conditioning \nfrom unregulated sources. The quiescent current of \nthe regulator is 40 µA in sleep mode, which is \nsuitable for battery-powered systems. An ultra-low \n1-μA current in shutdown mode can further prolong \nbattery life. A wide adjustable switching frequency \nrange allows either efficiency or external component \nsize to be optimized. Internal loop compensation \nmeans that the user is free from the tedious task of \nloop compensation design. This also minimizes the \nexternal components of the device. A precision enable \ninput allows simplification of regulator control and \nsystem power sequencing. The device also has built-\nin protection features such as cycle-by-cycle current \nlimit, thermal sensing and shutdown due to excessive \npower dissipation, and output overvoltage protection.\nThe LMR16030 is available in an 8-pin HSOIC \npackage with exposed pad for low thermal resistance.\nThe new product, LM76003 , requires very few \nexternal components and has a pinout designed for \nsimple, optimum PCB layout for EMI and thermal \nperformance.

It integrates a 155-mΩ (typical) high-side MOSFET and is capable of \ndelivering up to 3-A DC load current with exceptional efficiency and thermal performance in a very small solution \nsize. The operating current is typically 40 μA under no load condition (not switching). When the device is \ndisabled, the supply current is typically 1 μA. An extended family is available in 1-A and 2-A load options in \npin-to-pin compatible packages.\nThe LMR16030 implements constant frequency peak current mode control with sleep mode at light load to \nachieve high efficiency. The device is internally compensated, which reduces design time, and requires fewer \nexternal components. The switching frequency is programmable from 200 kHz to 2.5 MHz by an external resistor \nRT. The LMR16030 is also capable of synchronization to an external clock within the 250-kHz to 2.3-MHz \nfrequency range, which allows the device to be optimized to fit small board space at higher frequency, or high \nefficient power conversion at lower frequency.\nOther features included for more comprehensive system requirements are precision enable, adjustable soft-\nstart time, and approximately 97% duty cycle by aBOOT capacitor recharge circuit. These features provide a \nflexible and easy-to-use platform for a wide range of applications. Protection features include overtemperature \nshutdown, V OUT overvoltage protection (OVP), V IN undervoltage lockout (UVLO), cycle-by-cycle current limit, \nand short-circuit protection with frequency foldback.LMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Fixed Frequency Peak Current Mode Control\nThe following operating description of the LMR16030 will refer to the Functional Block Diagram  and to the \nwaveforms in Figure 7-1 . The LMR16030 output voltage is regulated by turning on the high-side N-MOSFET with \ncontrolled ON time. During high-side switch ON time, the SW pin voltage swings up to approximately V IN, and \nthe inductor current i L increases with alinear slope (V IN – V OUT) / L. When the high-side switch is off, inductor \ncurrent discharges through a freewheel diode with a slope of –V OUT / L. The control parameter of the buck \nconverter is defined as Duty Cycle D = t ON / T SW, where t ON is the high-side switch ON time and T SW is the \nswitching period. The regulator control loop maintains a constant output voltage by adjusting the duty cycle \nD. In an ideal buck converter where losses are ignored, D is proportional to the output voltage and inversely \nproportional to the input voltage: D = V OUT / VIN.www.ti.comLMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\nVSW\nVIND = t ON/ TSW\ntON tOFF\nTSWt\n-VD0SW Voltage\niL\nIOUT\nt\n0Inductor CurrentILPK\nûiLFigure 7-1. SW Node and Inductor Current Waveforms in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)\nThe LMR16030 employs fixed-frequency peak current mode control. A voltage feedback loop is used to get \naccurate DC voltage regulation by adjusting the peak current command based on voltage offset. The peak \ninductor current is sensed from the high-side switch and compared to the peak current to control the ON time \nof the high-side switch. The voltage feedback loop is internally compensated, which allows for fewer external \ncomponents, makes it easy to design, and provides stable operation with almost any combination of output \ncapacitors. The regulator operates with fixed switching frequency at normal load condition. At very light load, \nthe LMR16030 operates in sleep mode to maintain high efficiency and the switching frequency decreases with \nreduced load current.\n7.3.2 Slope Compensation\nThe LMR16030 adds a compensating ramp to the MOSFET switch current sense signal. This slope \ncompensation prevents sub-harmonic oscillations at duty cycles greater than 50%. The peak current limit of \nthe high-side switch is not affected by the slope compensation and remains constant over the full duty cycle \nrange.\n7.3.3 Sleep Mode\nThe LMR16030 operates in sleep mode at light load currents to improve efficiency by reducing switching and \ngate drive losses. If the output voltage is within regulation and the peak switch current at the end of any \nswitching cycle is below the current threshold of 300 mA, the device enters sleep mode. The sleep mode current \nthreshold is the peak switch current level corresponding to a nominal internal COMP voltage of 400 mV.\nWhen in sleep mode, the internal COMP voltage is clamped at 400 mV, the high-side MOSFET is inhibited, \nand the device draws only 40- μA (typical) input quiescent current. Since the device is not switching, the output \nvoltage begins to decay. The voltage control loop responds to the falling output voltage by increasing the internal \nCOMP voltage. The high-side MOSFET is enabled and switching resumes when the error amplifier lifts internal \nCOMP voltage above 400 mV. The output voltage recovers to the regulated value, and internal COMP voltage \neventually falls below the sleep mode threshold, at which time the device again enters sleep mode.\n7.3.4 Low Dropout Operation and Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT)\nThe LMR16030 provides an integrated bootstrap voltage regulator. A small capacitor between the BOOT and \nSW pins provides the gate drive voltage for the high-side MOSFET. The BOOT capacitor is refreshed when \nthe high-side MOSFET is off and the external low-side diode conducts. The recommended value of the BOOT \ncapacitor is 0.1 μF. A ceramic capacitor with an X7R or X5R grade dielectric with a voltage rating of 16 V or \ngreater is recommended for stable performance over temperature and voltage.\nWhen operating with a low voltage difference from input to output, the high-side MOSFET of the LMR16030 \noperates at approximate 97% duty cycle. When the high-side MOSFET is continuously on for five or six \nswitching cycles (five or six switching cycles for frequency lower than 1 MHz, and 10 or 11 switching cycles LMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\nfor frequency higher than 1 MHz) and the voltage from BOOT to SW drops below 3.2 V, the high-side MOSFET \nis turned off and an integrated low-side MOSFET pulls SW low to recharge the BOOT capacitor.\nSince the gate drive current sourced from the BOOT capacitor is small, the high-side MOSFET can remain on for \nmany switching cycles before the MOSFET is turned off to refresh the capacitor. Thus the effective duty cycle of \nthe switching regulator can be high, approaching 97%. The effective duty cycle of the converter during dropout \nis mainly influenced by the voltage drops across the power MOSFET, the inductor resistance, the low-side diode, \nvoltage and the printed circuit board resistance.\n7.3.5 Adjustable Output Voltage\nThe internal voltage reference produces a precise 0.75-V (typical) voltage reference over the operating \ntemperature range. The output voltage is set by a resistor divider from the output voltage to the FB pin. It is \nrecommended to use 1% tolerance or better and a temperature coefficient of 100 ppm or less divider resistors. \nSelect the low-side resistor R FBB for the desired divider current and use Equation 1  to calculate high-side R FBT. \nLarger value divider resistors are good for efficiency at light load. However, if the values are too high, the \nregulator is more susceptible to noise and voltage errors from the FB input current may become noticeable. R FBB \nin the range from 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ is recommended for most applications.\nVOUT\n  FBRFBT\nRFBB\nFigure 7-2.

The LMR16030 is disabled when the VIN pin voltage falls below 3.715 V \n(typical) or when the EN pin voltage is below 1.2 V. The EN pin has an internal pullup current source (typically \nIEN = 1 μA) that enables operation of the LMR16030 when the EN pin is floating.\nMany applications will benefit from the employment of an enable divider R ENT and R ENB in Figure 7-3  to establish \na precision system UVLO level for the stage. System UVLO can be used for supplies operating from utility power \nas well as battery power. It can be used for sequencing, ensuring reliable operation, or supply protection, such \nas a battery. An external logic signal can also be used to drive EN input for system sequencing and protection.\nWhen EN terminal voltage exceeds 1.2 V, an additional hysteresis current (typically I HYS = 3.6 μA) is sourced \nout of EN terminal. When the EN terminal is pulled below 1.2 V, I HYS current is removed. This additional current \nfacilitates adjustable input voltage UVLO hysteresis. Use Equation 2  and Equation 3  to calculate R ENT and R ENB \nfor desired UVLO hysteresis voltage.www.ti.comLMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\nVIN\n  ENRENT\nRENBVIN\nVENIEN IEN_HYSFigure 7-3.

The soft-start feature is \nused to prevent inrush current impacting the LMR16030 and its load when power is first applied. The soft-start \ntime can be programed by connecting an external capacitor C SS from SS pin to GND. An internal current source \n(typically I SS = 3 μA) charges C SS and generates a ramp from 0 V to V REF. The soft-start time can be calculated \nby Equation 4 :\nSS REF\nSS\nSSC (nF) V (V)t (ms)I ( A)u P\n(4)\nThe internal soft start resets while the device is disabled or in thermal shutdown.\n7.3.8 Switching Frequency and Synchronization (RT/SYNC)\nThe switching frequency of the LMR16030 can be programmed by the resistor RT from the RT/SYNC pin and \nGND pin. The RT/SYNC pin cannot be left floating or shorted to ground. To determine the timing resistance for \na given switching frequency, use Equation 5  or the curve in Figure 7-4 .

The PGOOD signal can be used for start-up sequencing of multiple rails or fault \nprotection. The PGOOD pin is an open-drain output that requires a pullup resistor to an appropriate DC voltage. \nVoltage seen by the PGOOD pin should never exceed 7 V. A resistor divider pair can be used to divide the \nvoltage down from a higher potential. A typical range of pullup resistor value is 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ.\nRefer to Figure 7-9 . When the FB voltage is within the power-good band, +7% above and -6% below the internal \nreference V REF typically, the PGOOD switch is turned off and the PGOOD voltage is pulled up to the voltage \nlevel defined by the pullup resistor or divider. When the FB voltage is outside of the tolerance band, +9% above \nor -8% below V REF typically, the PGOOD switch is turned on and the PGOOD pin voltage is pulled low to indicate \npower bad.LMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\n109%\n107%\n94%\n92%\nHigh\nLowVREF\nPGOODFigure 7-9. Power-Good Flag\n7.3.10 Overcurrent and Short Circuit Protection\nThe LMR16030 is protected from overcurrent condition by cycle-by-cycle current limiting on the peak current \nof the high-side MOSFET. High-side MOSFET overcurrent protection is implemented by the nature of the Peak \nCurrent Mode control. The high-side switch current is compared to the output of the Error Amplifier (EA) minus \nslope compensation every switching cycle. Please refer to Section 7.2 for more details. The peak current of \nhigh-side switch is limited by a clamped maximum peak current threshold which is constant,so the peak current \nlimit of the high-side switch is not affected by the slope compensation and remains constant over the full duty \ncycle range.\nThe LMR16030 also implements a frequency foldback to protect the converter in severe overcurrent or short \nconditions. The oscillator frequency is divided by 2, 4, and 8 as the FB pin voltage decrease to 75%, 50%, \n25% of V REF. The frequency foldback increases the off time by increasing the period of the switching cycle, so \nthat it provides more time for the inductor current to ramp down and leads to a lower average inductor current. \nLower frequency also means lower switching loss. Frequency foldback reduces power dissipation and prevents \noverheating and potential damage to the device.\n7.3.11 Overvoltage Protection\nThe LMR16030 employs an output overvoltage protection (OVP) circuit to minimize voltage overshoot when \nrecovering from output fault conditions or strong unload transients in designs with low output capacitance. \nThe OVP feature minimizes output overshoot by turning off the high-side switch immediately when FB voltage \nreaches to the rising OVP threshold which is nominally 109% of the internal voltage reference V REF. When the \nFB voltage drops below the falling OVP threshold, which is nominally 107% of V REF, the high-side MOSFET \nresumes normal operation.\n7.3.12 Thermal Shutdown\nThe LMR16030 provides an internal thermal shutdown to protect the device when the junction temperature \nexceeds 170°C (typical). The high-side MOSFET stops switching when thermal shundown activates. Once the \ndie temperature falls below 158°C (typical), the device reinitiates the power-up sequence controlled by the \ninternal soft-start circuitry.www.ti.comLMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Shutdown Mode\nThe EN pin provides electrical ON and OFF control for the LMR16030. When V EN is below 1.0 V, the device is \nin shutdown mode. The switching regulator is turned off and the quiescent current drops to 1.0 µA typically. The \nLMR16030 also employs undervoltage lockout protection. If V IN voltage is below the UVLO level, the regulator is \nturned off.\n7.4.2 Active Mode\nThe LMR16030 is in active mode when V EN is above the precision enable threshold and V IN is above its UVLO \nlevel. The simplest way to enable the LMR16030 is to connect the EN pin to VIN pin. This allows self start-up \nwhen the input voltage is in the operation range: 4.3 V to 60 V. Please refer to Section 7.3.6  for details on setting \nthese operating levels.\nIn active mode, depending on the load current, the LMR16030 is in one of three modes:\n1.Continuous conduction mode (CCM) with fixed switching frequency when load current is above half of the \npeak-to-peak inductor current ripple.\n2.Discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) with fixed switching frequency when load current is lower than half of \nthe peak-to-peak inductor current ripple in CCM operation.\n3.Sleep mode when internal COMP voltage drop to 400 mV at very light load.\n7.4.3 CCM Mode\nCCM operation is employed in the LMR16030 when the load current is higher than half of the peak-to-peak \ninductor current. In CCM operation, the frequency of operation is fixed, output voltage ripple is at a minimum in \nthis mode and the maximum output current of 3 A can be supplied by the LMR16030.\n7.4.4 Light Load Operation\nWhen the load current is lower than half of the peak-to-peak inductor current in CCM, the LMR16030 operates \nin DCM. At even lighter current loads, sleep mode is activated to maintain high efficiency operation by reducing \nswitching and gate drive losses.LMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

It is typically used to convert a higher DC voltage to a \nlower DC voltage with a maximum output current of 3 A. The following design procedure can be used to select \ncomponents for the LMR16030.

A schematic of 5-V / 3-A application circuit is shown in Figure 8-1 . The external components \nhave to fulfill the needs of the application, but also the stability criteria of the control loop of the device.\nSW7 V to 60 V\nGNDBOOT\nFB\nSSEN\nRT/SYNC\nRT\nCSSCBOOT\nCIN\nCOUTL\nRFBT\nRFBBVIN\nD5 V / 3 A\nFigure 8-1.

The divider network is \ncomprised of top feedback resistor R FBT and bottom feedback resistor R FBB. Equation 7  is used to determine the \noutput voltage:\nOUT\nFBT FBBV 0.75R R 0.75\x10 u \n(7)\nChoose the value of R FBT to be 100 k Ω. With the desired output voltage set to 5 V and the V FB = 0.75 V, the \nRFBB value can then be calculated using Equation 7 . The formula yields to a value 17.65 k Ω. Choose the closest \navailable value of 17.8 kΩ for R FBB.\n8.2.2.3 Switching Frequency\nFor desired frequency, use Equation 8  to calculate the required value for R T.\nS T1.088\nW¦ \x0bN+]\x0c R (k ) 42904\x10:  u\n(8)\nFor 500 KHz, the calculated R T is 49.66 k Ω and standard value 49.9 k Ω can be used to set the switching \nfrequency at 500 KHz.\n8.2.2.4 Output Inductor Selection\nThe most critical parameters for the inductor are the inductance, saturation current, and the RMS current. The \ninductance is based on the desired peak-to-peak ripple current, ΔiL. Since the ripple current increases with \nthe input voltage, the maximum input voltage is always used to calculate the minimum inductance L MIN. Use \nEquation 9  to calculate the minimum value of the output inductor. K IND is a coefficient that represents the amount \nof inductor ripple current relative to the maximum output current. A reasonable value of K IND must be 20%-40%. \nDuring an instantaneous short or overcurrent operation event, the RMS and peak inductor current can be high. \nThe inductor current rating must be higher than current limit.\nOUT IN_MAX OUT\nL\nIN_MAX SWV (V V )\nV ¦iLu \x10 \n\'  u u \n(9)\nIN_MAX OUT OUT\nMIN\nOUT IN SW D IN_MAXV V VLI ¦ K V \x10\n u u u \n(10)\nIn general, it is preferable to choose lower inductance in switching power supplies, because it usually \ncorresponds to faster transient response, smaller DCR, and reduced size for more compact designs. Too low of \nan inductance can generate too large of an inductor current ripple such that over current protection at the full \nload can be falsely triggered. It also generates more conduction loss since the RMS current is slightly higher.

With peak \ncurrent mode control, it is not recommended to have too small of an inductor current ripple. A larger peak current \nripple improves the comparator signal to noise ratio.\nFor this design example, choose K IND = 0.4, the minimum inductor value is calculated to be 7.64 µH, and a \nnearest standard value is chosen: 8.2 µH. A standard 8.2- μH ferrite inductor with a capability of 3-A RMS current \nand 6-A saturation current can be used.\n8.2.2.5 Output Capacitor Selection\nThe output capacitor or capacitors, C OUT, must be chosen with care since it directly affects the steady state \noutput voltage ripple, loop stability and the voltage overshoot and undershoot during load current transients.\nThe output ripple is essentially composed of two parts. One is caused by the inductor current ripple going \nthrough the Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) of the output capacitors:\nOUT_ESR L IND OUTV i ESR K I ESR\'  \' u  u u\n(11)\nThe other is caused by the inductor current ripple charging and discharging the output capacitors:\nIND OUT\nSW OUT SL\nOUT\nOUT_\nWCK I \nC C 8 ¦i\n¦V8u u\'u\' uu\n(12)\nThe two components in the voltage ripple are not in phase, so the actual peak-to-peak ripple is smaller than the \nsum of two peaks.\nOutput capacitance is usually limited by transient performance specifications if the system requires tight voltage \nregulation with presence of large current steps and fast slew rate. When a fast large load increase happens, \noutput capacitors provide the required charge before the inductor current can slew up to the appropriate level. \nThe control loop of the regulator usually needs three or more clock cycles to respond to the output voltage \ndroop. The output capacitance must be large enough to supply the current difference for three clock cycles \nto maintain the output voltage within the specified range. Equation 13  shows the minimum output capacitance \nneeded for specified output undershoot. When a sudden large load decrease happens, the output capacitors \nabsorb energy stored in the inductor. The catch diode cannot sink current so the energy stored in the inductor \nresults in an output voltage overshoot. Equation 14  calculates the minimum capacitance required to keep the \nvoltage overshoot within a specified range.\nOH OL\nO\nSWU\nUST3 (I I )C¦ 9 u \x10 \nu!\n(13)\n2 2 \nOUT2 2 \nOS OUTOH OL\nOUTI I C\n(V V ) VL\n\x0e \x10 \x10! u \n(14)\nwhere\n•KIND = Ripple ratio of the inductor ripple current (Δi L / IOUT)\n•IOL = Low level output current during load transient\n•IOH = High level output current during load transient\n•VUS = Target output voltage undershoot\n•VOS = Target output voltage overshoot\nFor this design example, the target output ripple is 50 mV. Presuppose ΔVOUT_ESR  = ΔVOUT_C  = 50 mV, and \nchose K IND = 0.4. Equation 11  yields ESR no larger than 41.7 m Ω and Equation 12  yields C OUT no smaller than \n6 μF. For the target overshoot and undershoot range of this design, V US = V OS = 5% × V OUT = 250 mV. The C OUT \ncan be calculated to be no smaller than 64.8 μF and 6.4 μF by Equation 13  and Equation 14  respectively. In \nsummary, the most stringent criteria for the output capacitor is 100 μF. For this design example, two 47- μF, 16-V, \nX7R ceramic capacitors with 5-mΩ ESR are used in parallel.www.ti.comLMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\n8.2.2.6 Schottky Diode Selection\nThe breakdown voltage rating of the diode is preferred to be 25% higher than the maximum input voltage. The \ncurrent rating for the diode must be equal to the maximum output current for best reliability in most applications. \nIn cases where the input voltage is much greater than the output voltage, the average diode current is lower. In \nthis case it is possible to use a diode with a lower average current rating, approximately (1-D) × I OUT however \nthe peak current rating must be higher than the maximum load current. A 3-A rated diode is a good starting \npoint.\n8.2.2.7 Input Capacitor Selection\nThe LMR16030 device requires high frequency input decoupling capacitor or capacitors and a bulk input \ncapacitor, depending on the application. The typical recommended value for the high frequency decoupling \ncapacitor is 4.7 μF to 10 μF. A high-quality ceramic capacitor type X5R or X7R with sufficiency voltage rating \nis recommended. To compensate the derating of ceramic capacitors, a voltage rating of twice the maximum \ninput voltage is recommended. Additionally, some bulk capacitance can be required, especially if the LMR16030 \ncircuit is not located within approximately 5 cm from the input voltage source. This capacitor is used to provide \ndamping to the voltage spike due to the lead inductance of the cable or the trace. For this design, two 2.2- μF, \nX7R ceramic capacitors rated for 100 V are used. 0.1 μF for high-frequency filtering and place it as close as \npossible to the device pins.\n8.2.2.8 Bootstrap Capacitor Selection\nEvery LMR16030 design requires a bootstrap capacitor (C BOOT ). The recommended capacitor is 0.1 μF and \nrated 16 V or higher. The bootstrap capacitor is located between the SW pin and the BOOT pin. The bootstrap \ncapacitor must be a high-quality ceramic type with an X7R or X5R grade dielectric for temperature stability.LMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nUnless otherwise specified the following conditions apply: V IN = 24 V, f SW = 500 KHz, L = 8.2 µH, C OUT = 2 × 47 µF, T A = \n25°C.\nVIN = 24 V VOUT = 5 V IOUT = 2 A\nFigure 8-2.

This input \nsupply must be able to withstand the maximum input current and maintain a stable voltage. The resistance of the \ninput supply rail should be low enough that an input current transient does not cause a high enough drop at the \nLMR16030 supply voltage that can cause a false UVLO fault triggering and system reset. If the input supply is \nlocated more than a few inches from the LMR16030, additional bulk capacitance can be required in addition to \nthe ceramic input capacitors. The amount of bulk capacitance is not critical, but a 47- μF or 100- μF electrolytic \ncapacitor is a typical choice.www.ti.comLMR16030\nSNVSAH9B – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: LMR16030\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nLayout is a critical portion of good power supply design.
