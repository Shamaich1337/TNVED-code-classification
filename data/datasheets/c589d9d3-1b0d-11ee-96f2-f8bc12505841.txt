Peak-current-\nmode control is employed to achieve simple control-\nloop compensation and cycle-by-cycle current limiting. \nA quiescent current of 75 μA makes the device \nsuitable for battery-powered systems. An ultra-low \n2 μA shutdown current can further prolong battery \nlife. Internal loop compensation means that the user \nis free from the tedious task of loop compensation \ndesign. This also minimizes the external components. \nThe device has an option for constant frequency \nFPWM mode to achieve small output-voltage ripple at \nlight load. An extended family (HSOIC) is available in \n1-A (LMR23610) and 2.5-A (LMR23625) load-current \noptions in a pin-to-pin compatible package allowing \nsimple, optimum PCB layout. A precision enable \ninput allows simplification of regulator control and \nsystem power sequencing. Protection features include \ncycle-by-cycle current limit, hiccup-mode short-circuit \nprotection, and thermal shutdown due to excessive \npower dissipation.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER (1)PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nLMR23630HSOIC (8) 4.89 mm × 3.90 mm\nWSON (12) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\n(1) For detail part numbers for all available different options, see \nthe orderable addendum at the end of the data sheet.\nBOOT\nSWLCBOOT\nFBVINVIN up to 36 V\nPGNDCOUTEN/SYNCCIN\nVCCAGNDVOUT \nCVCCRFBT\nRFBB\nSimplified Schematic\nIOUT (A)Efficiency (%)\n0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10405060708090100\nD001VOUT = 5 V\nVOUT = 3.3 V\nEfficiency vs Load V IN = 12 V, PFM OptionLMR23630\nSNVSAH2E  – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The device delivers up to 3-A DC load current with good thermal \nperformance in a small solution size. For both the HSOIC and WSON packages, an extended family is available \nin multiple current options from 1 A to 3 A in pin-to-pin compatible packages.\nThe LMR23630 employs constant frequency peak-current-mode control. The device enters PFM mode at light \nload to achieve high efficiency. A user-selectable FPWM version is provided to achieve low output voltage \nripple, tight output voltage regulation, and constant switching frequency. The switching frequency is 400 kHz for \nthe fixed-frequency version. For the version which has RT pin, the switching frequency is adjustable from 200 \nkHz to 2.2 MHz. The device is internally compensated, which reduces design time and requires few external \ncomponents. The LMR23630 is capable of synchronization to an external clock within the range of 200 kHz to \n2.2 MHz.\nAdditional features such as precision enable, power-good flag, and internal soft-start provide a flexible and \neasy-to-use solution for a wide range of applications. Protection features include thermal shutdown, VIN and \nVCC undervoltage lockout, cycle-by-cycle current limit, and hiccup-mode short-circuit protection.\nThe family requires very few external components and has a pinout designed for simple, optimum PCB layout.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nEA\n REFEN/SYNC\nSWCBOOTVCC\nInternal\nSS\nOV/UV\nDetector\nOscillatorPrecision\nEnableLDO\nPFM\nDetector\nSlope\nCompPWM CONTROL LOGICUVLO TSD\nFreq\nFoldbackZero\nCrossHICCUP\nDetectorVIN\nRc\nCc\nPGNDFBLS I SenseHS I Sense\nFBVCC\nEnableSYNC\nDetectorSYNC Signal\nSYNC SignalAGND(PGOOD)\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated(RT)LMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Fixed Frequency Peak Current Mode Control\nThe following operating description of the LMR23630 refers to Section 8.2 and to the waveforms in Figure 8-1 . \nThe LMR23630 is a step-down synchronous buck regulator with integrated high-side (HS) and low-side (LS) \nswitches (synchronous rectifier). The LMR23630 supplies a regulated output voltage by turning on the HS and \nLS NMOS switches with controlled duty cycle. During high-side switch ON-time, the SW pin voltage swings up \nto approximately V IN, and the inductor current i L increase with linear slope (V IN – V OUT) / L. When the HS switch \nis turned off by the control logic, the LS switch is turned on after an anti-shoot-through dead time. Inductor \ncurrent discharges through the LS switch with a slope of –V OUT / L. The control parameter of a buck converter is \ndefined as duty cycle D = t ON / TSW, where t ON is the high-side switch ON-time and T SW is the switching period. \nThe regulator control loop maintains a constant output voltage by adjusting the duty cycle D. In an ideal buck \nconverter, where losses are ignored, D is proportional to the output voltage and inversely proportional to the \ninput voltage: D = V OUT / VIN.\nVSW\nVIND = t ON/ TSW\ntON tOFF\nTSWt\n-VD0SW Voltage\niL\nIOUT\nt\n0Inductor CurrentILPK\n\'iL\nFigure 8-1. SW Node and Inductor Current Waveforms in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)\nThe LMR23630 employs fixed-frequency peak-current-mode control. A voltage feedback loop is used to get \naccurate DC voltage regulation by adjusting the peak current command based on voltage offset. The peak \ninductor current is sensed from the high-side switch and compared to the peak current threshold to control the \nON-time of the high-side switch. The voltage feedback loop is internally compensated, which allows for fewer \nexternal components, makes it easy to design, and provides stable operation with almost any combination of \noutput capacitors. The regulator operates with fixed switching frequency at normal load condition. At light load \ncondition, the LMR23630 operates in PFM mode to maintain high efficiency (PFM option) or in FPWM mode for \nlow output-voltage ripple, tight output-voltage regulation, and constant switching frequency (FPWM option).\n8.3.2 Adjustable Frequency\nThe switching frequency can be programmed for the adjustable-switching-frequency version of LMR23630 by \nthe impedance R T from the RT pin to ground. The frequency is inversely proportional to the R T resistance. The \nRT pin can be left floating and the LMR23630 operates at 400-kHz default switching frequency. The RT pin is \nnot designed to be shorted to ground. For a desired frequency, typical R T resistance can be found by Equation 1 . \nTable 8-1  gives typical R T values for a given f SW.\nRT(kΩ) = 40200 / f SW(kHz) – 0.6 (1)www.ti.comLMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n050100150200250\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500RT Resistance (k \x9f) \nSwitching Frequency (kHz) C008 Figure 8-2.

The output voltage is set by a resistor divider from output voltage to the FB pin. TI \nrecommends using 1% tolerance resistors with a low temperature coefficient for the FB divider. Select the \nlowside resistor RFBB for the desired divider current and use Equation 2  to calculate high-side R FBT. RFBT in the \nrange from 10 k Ω to 100 k Ω is recommended for most applications. A lower RFBT value can be used if static \nloading is desired to reduce VOUT offset in PFM operation. Lower RFBT will reduce efficiency at very light load. \nLess static current goes through a larger RFBT and might be more desirable when light load efficiency is critical. \nHowever, RFBT larger than 1 M Ω is not recommended because it makes the feedback path more susceptible \nto noise. Larger RFBT value requires more carefully designed feedback path on the PCB. The tolerance and \ntemperature variation of the resistor dividers affect the output voltage regulation.\nVOUT\n  FBRFBT\nRFBB\nFigure 8-3.

A voltage less than 1 V \n(typical) shuts down the device while a voltage higher than 1.6 V (typical) is required to start the regulator. \nThe EN/SYNC pin is an input and cannot be left open or floating. The simplest way to enable the operation of \nthe LMR23630 is to connect the EN to V IN. This allows self-start-up of the LMR23630 when V IN is within the \noperation range.\nMany applications can benefit from the employment of an enable divider R ENT and R ENB (Figure 8-4 ) to establish \na precision system UVLO level for the converter. System UVLO can be used for supplies operating from utility \npower as well as battery power. It can be used for sequencing, ensuring reliable operation, or supply protection, \nsuch as a battery discharge level. An external logic signal can also be used to drive EN input for system \nsequencing and protection.\nRENT\nEN/SYNCVIN\nRENB\nFigure 8-4. System UVLO by Enable Divider\nThe EN pin also can be used to synchronize the internal oscillator to an external clock. The internal oscillator \ncan be synchronized by AC-coupling a positive edge into the EN pin. The AC-coupled peak-to-peak voltage \nat the EN pin must exceed the SYNC amplitude threshold of 2.8 V (typical) to trip the internal synchronization \npulse detector, and the minimum SYNC clock ON-time and OFF-time must be longer than 100 ns (typical). \nA 3.3-V or a higher amplitude pulse signal coupled through a 1-nF capacitor C SYNC is a good starting point. \nKeeping R ENT // R ENB (RENT parallel with R ENB) in the 100 k Ω range is a good choice. R ENT is required for this \nsynchronization circuit, but R ENB can be left unmounted if system UVLO is not needed. LMR23630 switching \naction can be synchronized to an external clock from 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz. Figure 8-6  and Figure 8-7  show the \ndevice synchronized to an external system clock.\nRENT\nClock\nSourceEN/SYNCCSYNCVIN\nRENB\nFigure 8-5.

Synchronizing in PWM Mode\n Figure 8-7. Synchronizing in PFM Mode\n8.3.5 VCC, UVLO\nThe LMR23630 integrates an internal LDO to generate V CC for control circuitry and MOSFET drivers. The \nnominal voltage for V CC is 4.1 V. The VCC pin is the output of an LDO and must be properly bypassed. Place a \nhigh-quality ceramic capacitor with a value of 2.2 µF to 10 µF, 16 V or higher rated voltage as close as possible \nto VCC and grounded to the exposed PAD and ground pins. The VCC output pin must not be loaded, or shorted \nto ground during operation. Shorting VCC to ground during operation may cause damage to the LMR23630.\nVCC undervoltage lockout (UVLO) prevents the LMR23630 from operating until the V CC voltage exceeds 3.3 V \n(typical). The VCC UVLO threshold has 400 mV (typical) of hysteresis to prevent undesired shutdown due to \ntemporary V IN drops.\n8.3.6 Minimum ON-time, Minimum OFF-time and Frequency Foldback at Dropout Conditions\nMinimum ON-time, T ON_MIN , is the smallest duration of time that the HS switch can be on. T ON_MIN  is typically \n60 ns in the LMR23630. Minimum OFF-time, T OFF_MIN , is the smallest duration that the HS switch can be \noff. T OFF_MIN  is typically 100 ns in the LMR23630. In CCM operation, T ON_MIN  and T OFF_MIN   limit the voltage \nconversion range given a selected switching frequency.\nThe minimum duty cycle allowed is:\nDMIN = T ON_MIN  × fSW (3)\nAnd the maximum duty cycle allowed is:\nDMAX = 1 – T OFF_MIN  × fSW (4)\nGiven fixed T ON_MIN  and T OFF_MIN , the higher the switching frequency the narrower the range of the allowed \nduty cycle. In the LMR23630, a frequency foldback scheme is employed to extend the maximum duty cycle \nwhen T OFF_MIN  is reached. The switching frequency decreases once longer duty cycle is needed under low V IN \nconditions. Wide range of frequency foldback allows the LMR23630 output voltage stay in regulation with a much \nlower supply voltage V IN. This leads to a lower effective dropout voltage.\nGiven an output voltage, the choice of the switching frequency affects the allowed input voltage range, solution \nsize and efficiency. The maximum operation supply voltage can be found by:\n\x0b \x0cOUT\nIN_MAX\nSW ON_MINVV\nf T  \nu\n(5)\nAt lower supply voltage, the switching frequency decreases once T OFF_MIN  is tripped.

Frequency Foldback at Dropout (V OUT = 5 V, f SW = 400 kHz)\n8.3.7 Power Good (PGOOD)\nThe power-good version of LMR23630 has a built in power-good flag shown on PGOOD pin to indicate whether \nthe output voltage is within its regulation level. The PGOOD signal can be used for start-up sequencing of \nmultiple rails or fault protection. The PGOOD pin is an open-drain output that requires a pullup resistor to an \nappropriate DC voltage. Voltage detected by the PGOOD pin must never exceed 15 V, and limit the maximum \ncurrent into this pin to 1 mA. A typical range of pullup resistor value is 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ.\nWhen the FB voltage is within the power-good band, +6% above and –6% below the internal reference voltage \nVREF typically, the PGOOD switch is turned off, and the PGOOD voltage is as high as the pulled-up voltage. \nWhen the FB voltage is outside of the tolerance band, +7% above or –7% below V REF typically, the PGOOD \nswitch is turned on, and the PGOOD pin voltage is pulled low to indicate power bad. A glitch filter prevents false \nflag operation for short excursions in the output voltage, such as during line and load transients. The values for \nthe various filter and delay times can be found in Section 7.6. Power-good operation can best be understood by \nreference to Figure 8-9 .\nVREF\nPGOOD107%\n106%\n93%94%\nHigh\nLow\nFigure 8-9.

The internal compensation is designed so \nthat the loop response is stable over the entire operating frequency and output voltage range. Depending on the \noutput voltage, the compensation loop phase margin can be low with all ceramic capacitors. TI recommends an \nexternal feed-forward capacitor C FF be placed in parallel with the top resistor divider R FBT for optimum transient \nperformance.\nRFBT\nFBVOUT\nRFBBCFF\nFigure 8-10. Feed-forward Capacitor for Loop Compensation\nThe feed-forward capacitor C FF in parallel with R FBT places an additional zero before the crossover frequency of \nthe control loop to boost phase margin. The zero frequency can be found by:\n\x0b \x0cZ _ CFF\nFF FBT1f2 C R Su u\n(7)\nAn additional pole is also introduced with C FF at the frequency of:\n\x0b \x0cP _ CFF\nFF FBT FBB1f2 C R //R Su u\n(8)\nThe zero f Z_CFF  adds phase boost at the crossover frequency and improves transient response. The pole f P-CFF \nhelps maintaining proper gain margin at frequency beyond the crossover. Table 9-1  lists the combination of \nCOUT, CFF and R FBT for typical applications,  designs with similar C OUT but R FBT other than recommended value, \nadjust C FF such that (C FF × R FBT) is unchanged and adjust R FBB such that (R FBT / RFBB) is unchanged.\nDesigns with different combinations of output capacitors need different C FF. Different types of capacitors have \ndifferent equivalent series resistance (ESR). Ceramic capacitors have the smallest ESR and need the most CFF. \nElectrolytic capacitors have much larger ESR than ceramic, and the ESR zero frequency location would be low \nenough to boost the phase up around the crossover frequency. Designs that use mostly electrolytic capacitors at \nthe output may not need any CFF. The location of this ESR zero frequency can be calculated with Equation 9 :\n\x0b \x0cZ _ESR\nOUT1f2 C ESR Su u\n(9)\nThe C FF creates a time constant with R FBT that couples in the attenuate output voltage ripple to the FB node. \nIf the C FF value is too large, it can couple too much ripple to the FB and affect V OUT regulation. Therefore, \ncalculate C FF based on output capacitors used in the system. At cold temperatures, the value of C FF might \nchange based on the tolerance of the chosen component. This may reduce its impedance and ease noise \ncoupling on the FB node. To avoid this, more capacitance can be added to the output or the value of C FF can be \nreduced.\n8.3.9 Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT)\nThe LMR23630 provides an integrated bootstrap voltage regulator. A small capacitor between the BOOT and \nSW pins provides the gate drive voltage for the high-side MOSFET. The BOOT capacitor is refreshed when the \nhigh-side MOSFET is off and the low-side switch conducts. The recommended value of the BOOT capacitor is LMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n0.1 μ F to 0.47 μF. TI recommends a ceramic capacitor with an X7R or X5R grade dielectric with a voltage rating \nof 16 V or higherfor stable performance over temperature and voltage.\n8.3.10 Overcurrent and Short-Circuit Protection\nThe LMR23630 is protected from over-current conditions by cycle-by-cycle current limit on both the peak and \nvalley of the inductor current. Hiccup mode will be activated if a fault condition persists to prevent over-heating.\nHigh-side MOSFET overcurrent protection is implemented by the nature of the peak-current-mode control. The \nHS switch current is sensed when the HS is turned on after a set blanking time. The HS switch current is \ncompared to the output of the error amplifier (EA) minus slope compensation every switching cycle. See the \nSection 8.2 for more details. The peak current of HS switch is limited by a clamped maximum peak current \nthreshold I HS_LIMIT  which is constant. Thus, the peak current limit of the high-side switch is not affected by the \nslope compensation and remains constant over the full duty cycle range.\nThe current going through LS MOSFET is also sensed and monitored. When the LS switch turns on, the inductor \ncurrent begins to ramp down. The LS switch is not turned OFF at the end of a switching cycle if its current is \nabove the LS current limit I LS_LIMIT . The LS switch is kept ON so that inductor current keeps ramping down, until \nthe inductor current ramps below the LS current limit I LS_LIMIT . Then the LS switch is turned OFF, and the HS \nswitch is turned on after a dead time. This is somewhat different than the more typical peak current limit and \nresults in Equation 10  for the maximum load current.\n\x0b \x0cIN OUT OUT\nOUT _MAX LS _LIMIT\nSW INV V VI I 2 f L V\x10 \x0e uu u \n(10)\nIf the current of the LS switch is higher than the LS current limit for 64 consecutive cycles, hiccup current \nprotection mode is activated. In hiccup mode, the regulator is shut down and kept off for 5 ms typically before \nthe LMR23630 tries to start again. If overcurrent or short-circuit fault condition still exist, hiccup will repeat until \nthe fault condition is removed. Hiccup mode reduces power dissipation under severe overcurrent conditions, \nprevents over-heating and potential damage to the device.\nFor FPWM version, the inductor current is allowed to go negative. If this current exceed I L_NEG , the LS switch is \nturned off until the next clock cycle. This is used to protect the LS switch from excessive negative current.\n8.3.11 Thermal Shutdown\nThe LMR23630 provides an internal thermal shutdown to protect the device when the junction temperature \nexceeds 170°C (typical). The device is turned off when thermal shutdown activates. Once the die temperature \nfalls below 155°C (typical), the device reinitiates the power-up sequence controlled by the internal soft-start \ncircuitry.www.ti.comLMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Shutdown Mode\nThe EN pin provides electrical ON and OFF control for the LMR23630. When V EN is below 1 V (typical), the \ndevice is in shutdown mode. The LMR23630 also employs VIN and VCC UVLO protection. If V IN or V CC voltage \nis below their respective UVLO level, the regulator is turned off.\n8.4.2 Active Mode\nThe LMR23630 is in active mode when V EN is above the precision enable threshold, V IN and V CC are above \ntheir respective UVLO level. The simplest way to enable the LMR23630 is to connect the EN pin to VIN pin. This \nallows self startup when the input voltage is in the operating range 4 V to 36 V. See Section 8.3.5  and Section \n8.3.4  for details on setting these operating levels.\nIn active mode, depending on the load current, the LMR23630 is in one of four modes:\n1.Continuous conduction mode (CCM) with fixed switching frequency when load current is above half of the \npeak-to-peak inductor current ripple (for both PFM and FPWM options).\n2.Discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) with fixed switching frequency when load current is lower than half of \nthe peak-to-peak inductor current ripple in CCM operation (only for PFM option).\n3.Pulse frequency modulation mode (PFM) when switching frequency is decreased at very light load (only for \nPFM option).\n4.Forced pulse width modulation mode (FPWM) with fixed switching frequency even at light load (only for \nFPWM option).\n8.4.3 CCM Mode\nCCM operation is employed in the LMR23630 when the load current is higher than half of the peak-to-peak \ninductor current. In CCM operation, the frequency of operation is fixed, output voltage ripple is at a minimum in \nthis mode, and the maximum output current of 3 A can be supplied by the LMR23630.\n8.4.4 Light Load Operation (PFM Version)\nFor PFM version, when the load current is lower than half of the peak-to-peak inductor current in CCM, the \nLMR23630 operates in DCM, also known as diode emulation mode (DEM). In DCM, the LS switch is turned \noff when the inductor current drops to I L_ZC (–40 mA typical). Both switching losses and conduction losses are \nreduced in DCM, compared to forced PWM operation at light load.\nAt even lighter current loads, PFM is activated to maintain high efficiency operation. When either the minimum \nHS switch ON-time (t ON_MIN  ) or the minimum peak inductor current I PEAK_MIN  (300 mA typ) is reached, the \nswitching frequency decreases to maintain regulation. In PFM, switching frequency is decreased by the control \nloop when load current reduces to maintain output voltage regulation. Switching loss is further reduced in \nPFM operation due to less frequent switching actions. The external clock synchronizing is not valid when the \nLMR23630 device enters into PFM mode.\n8.4.5 Light Load Operation (FPWM Version)\nFor FPWM version, LMR23630 is locked in PWM mode at full load range. This operation is maintained, even at \nno-load, by allowing the inductor current to reverse its normal direction. This mode trades off reduced light load \nefficiency for low output voltage ripple, tight output voltage regulation, and constant switching frequency. In this \nmode, a negative current limit of I L_NEG  is imposed to prevent damage to the regulators low side FET. When in \nFPWM mode the converter synchronizes to any valid clock signal on the EN/SYNC input.LMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and \nTI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

The divider network is \ncomprised of top feedback resistor R FBT and bottom feedback resistor R FBB. Equation 11  is used to determine \nthe output voltage:\nOUT REF\nFBT FBB\nREFV V R R V\x10 u \n(11)\nChoose the value of R FBB to be 22.1 k Ω. With the desired output voltage set to 5 V and the V REF = 1 V, the R FBB \nvalue can then be calculated using Equation 11 . The formula yields to a value 88.7 kΩ.\n9.2.2.3 Switching Frequency\nThe default switching frequency of the LMR23630 is 400 kHz. For other switching frequency, the device must be \nsynchronized to an external clock, see Section 8.3.4  for more details.\n9.2.2.4 Inductor Selection\nThe most critical parameters for the inductor are the inductance, saturation current, and the rated current. The \ninductance is based on the desired peak-to-peak ripple current ΔiL. Because the ripple current increases with LMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\nthe input voltage, the maximum input voltage is always used to calculate the minimum inductance L MIN. Use \nEquation 12  to calculate the minimum value of the output inductor. K IND is a coefficient that represents the \namount of inductor ripple current relative to the maximum output current of the device. A reasonable value of \nKIND should be 20% to 40%. During an instantaneous short or overcurrent operation event, the RMS and peak \ninductor current can be high. The inductor current rating should be higher than the current limit of the device.\n\x0b \x0c OUT IN_MAX OUT\nL\nIN_MAX SWV V V\niV L fu \x10 \n\'  u u \n(12)\nIN_MAX OUT OUT\nMIN\nOUT IND IN_MAX SWV V VLI K V f\x10\n u u u \n(13)\nIn general, it is preferable to choose lower inductance in switching power supplies, because it usually \ncorresponds to faster transient response, smaller DCR, and reduced size for more compact designs. However, \ninductance that is too low can generate an inductor current ripple that is too high so that overcurrent protection \nat the full load could be falsely triggered. It also generates more conduction loss and inductor core loss. Larger \ninductor current ripple also implies larger output voltage ripple with same output capacitors. With peak current \nmode control, TI does not recommend having an inductor current ripple that is too small. A larger peak-current \nripple improves the comparator signal-to-noise ratio.\nFor this design example, choose K IND = 0.4, the minimum inductor value is calculated to be 8.56 µH. Choose the \nnearest standard 8.2 μH ferrite inductor with a capability of 4-A RMS current and 6-A saturation current.\n9.2.2.5 Output Capacitor Selection\nChoose the output capacitor(s), C OUT, with care because it directly affects the steady-state output-voltage ripple, \nloop stability, and the voltage over/undershoot during load-current transients.\nThe output ripple is essentially composed of two parts. One is caused by the inductor current ripple going \nthrough the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the output capacitors:\nOUT_ESR L IND OUTV i ESR K I ESR\'  \' u  u u\n(14)\nThe other is caused by the inductor current ripple charging and discharging the output capacitors:\n\x0b \x0c \x0b \x0cIND OUT L\nOUT _ C\nSW OUT SW OUTK I iV8 f C 8 f Cu \'\'   u u u u\n(15)\nThe two components in the voltage ripple are not in phase, so the actual peak-to-peak ripple is smaller than the \nsum of two peaks.\nOutput capacitance is usually limited by transient performance specifications if the system requires tight voltage \nregulation with presence of large current steps and fast slew rate. When a fast large load increase happens, \noutput capacitors provide the required charge before the inductor current can slew up to the appropriate level. \nThe control loop of the regulator usually needs four or more clock cycles to respond to the output voltage droop. \nThe output capacitance must be large enough to supply the current difference for four clock cycles to maintain \nthe output voltage within the specified range. Equation 17  shows the minimum output capacitance needed \nfor specified output undershoot. When a sudden large load decrease happens, the output capacitors absorb \nenergy stored in the inductor. which results in an output voltage overshoot. Equation 14  calculates the minimum \ncapacitance required to keep the voltage overshoot within a specified range.www.ti.comLMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n\x0b \x0cOH OL\nOUT\nSW US4 I ICf V u \x10 !u(16)\n\x0b \x0c2 2 \nOH OL\nOUT 2 2\nOUT OS OUTI I C L \nV V V\x10! u \n\x0e \x10 \n(17)\nwhere\n•IOL = Low level output current during load transient\n•IOH = High level output current during load transient\n•VUS = Target output voltage undershoot\n•VOS = Target output voltage overshoot\nFor this design example, the target output ripple is 50 mV. Presuppose ΔVOUT_ESR  = ΔVOUT_C  = 50 mV, and \nchose K IND = 0.4. Equation 16  yields ESR no larger than 41.7 m Ω and Equation 17  yields C OUT no smaller than \n7.5 μ F. For the target over/undershoot range of this design, V US = V OS = 5% × V OUT = 250 mV. The C OUT can be \ncalculated to be no smaller than 108 μF and 28.5 μF by Equation 15  and Equation 17 , respectively. Consider of \nderating, one 47-μF, 16-V and one 100-μF, 10-V ceramic capacitor with 5-mΩ ESR are used in parallel.\n9.2.2.6 Feed-Forward Capacitor\nThe LMR23630 is internally compensated. Depending on the V OUT and frequency f SW, if the output capacitor \nCOUT is dominated by low-ESR (ceramic types) capacitors, it could result in low phase margin. To improve the \nphase boost an external feed-forward capacitor C FF can be added in parallel with R FBT. CFF is chosen such \nthat phase margin is boosted at the crossover frequency without C FF. A simple estimation for the crossover \nfrequency (f X) without C FF is shown in Equation 18 , assuming C OUT has very small ESR, and C OUT value is after \nderating.\nX\nOUT OUT8.32fV C  u\n(18)\nEquation 19  for C FF was tested:\nFF\nX FBT1C4 f R Su u\n(19)\nFor designs with higher ESR, C FF is not needed when C OUT has very high ESR and C FF calculated from \nEquation 19  must reduced with medium ESR. Table 9-1  can be used as a quick starting point.\nFor the application in this design example, a 47-pF, 50-V, COG capacitor is selected.\n9.2.2.7 Input Capacitor Selection\nThe LMR23630 device requires high-frequency input decoupling capacitor(s) and a bulk input capacitor, \ndepending on the application. The typical recommended value for the high-frequency decoupling capacitor is \n4.7 μF to 10 μF. TI recommends a high-quality ceramic capacitor type X5R or X7R with sufficiency voltage \nrating. To compensate the derating of ceramic capacitors, a voltage rating twice the maximum input voltage is \nrecommended. Additionally, some bulk capacitance can be required, especially if the LMR23630 circuit is not \nlocated within approximately 5 cm from the input voltage source. This capacitor is used to provide damping to \nthe voltage spike due to the lead inductance of the cable or the trace. For this design, two 4.7- μF, 50-V, X7R \nceramic capacitors are used. A 0.1- μF for high-frequency filtering and place it as close as possible to the device \npins.\n9.2.2.8 Bootstrap Capacitor Selection\nEvery LMR23630 design requires a bootstrap capacitor (C BOOT ). TI recommends a capacitor of 0.47 μF, ated 16 \nV or higher. The bootstrap capacitor is located between the SW pin and the BOOT pin. The bootstrap capacitor \nmust be a high-quality ceramic type with an X7R or X5R grade dielectric for temperature stability.LMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n9.2.2.9 VCC Capacitor Selection\nThe VCC pin is the output of an internal LDO for LMR23630.

This input supply must be able to withstand the \nmaximum input current and maintain a stable voltage. The resistance of the input supply rail must be low enough \nthat an input current transient does not cause a high enough drop at the LMR23630 supply voltage that can \ncause a false UVLO fault triggering and system reset. If the input supply is located more than a few inches from \nthe LMR23630, additional bulk capacitance may be required in addition to the ceramic input capacitors. The \namount of bulk capacitance is not critical, but a 47-μF or 100-μF electrolytic capacitor is a typical choice.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nLayout is a critical portion of good power supply design. The following guidelines will help users design a PCB \nwith the best power conversion performance, thermal performance, and minimized generation of unwanted EMI.\n1.The input bypass capacitor C IN must be placed as close as possible to the VIN and PGND pins. Grounding \nfor both the input and output capacitors should consist of localized top side planes that connect to the PGND \npin and PAD.\n2.Place bypass capacitors for V CC close to the VCC pin and ground the bypass capacitor to device ground.\n3.Minimize trace length to the FB pin net. Both feedback resistors, R FBT and R FBB should be located close to \nthe FB pin. Place C FF directly in parallel with R FBT. If V OUT accuracy at the load is important, make sure V OUT \nsense is made at the load. Route V OUT sense path away from noisy nodes and preferably through a layer on \nthe other side of a shielded layer.\n4.Use ground plane in one of the middle layers as noise shielding and heat dissipation path.\n5.Have a single point ground connection to the plane. The ground connections for the feedback and enable \ncomponents should be routed to the ground plane. This prevents any switched or load currents from flowing \nin the analog ground traces. If not properly handled, poor grounding can result in degraded load regulation or \nerratic output voltage ripple behavior.\n6.Make V IN, VOUT and ground bus connections as wide as possible. This reduces any voltage drops on the \ninput or output paths of the converter and maximizes efficiency.\n7.Provide adequate device heat-sinking. Use an array of heat-sinking vias to connect the exposed pad to the \nground plane on the bottom PCB layer. If the PCB has multiple copper layers, these thermal vias can also be \nconnected to inner layer heat-spreading ground planes. Ensure enough copper area is used for heat-sinking \nto keep the junction temperature below 125 °C.LMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n11.2 Layout Example\nEN/\nSYNCAGNDVINPGNDSW\nBOOT\nVCC\nFB   UVLO Adjust ResistorInput Bypass \nCapacitorOutput Bypass \nCapacitor\nBOOT Capacitor\nThermal VIA\nVIA (Connect to GND Plane)Output Inductor\nOutput Voltage Set \nResistor\n VCC\nCapacitor\nFigure 11-1.

Placing \nceramic bypass capacitor(s) as close as possible to the VIN and PGND pins is the key to EMI reduction.\nThe SW pin connecting to the inductor must be as short as possible and just wide enough to carry the load \ncurrent without excessive heating. Use short, thick traces or copper pours (shapes) high current conduction path \nto minimize parasitic resistance. Place the output capacitors close to the V OUT end of the inductor and closely \ngrounded to PGND pin and exposed PAD.\nPlace the bypass capacitors on VCC as close as possible to the pin and closely grounded to PGND and the \nexposed PAD.\n11.4 Ground Plane and Thermal Considerations\nTI recommends using one of the middle layers as a solid ground plane. Ground plane provides shielding \nfor sensitive circuits and traces. It also provides a quiet reference potential for the control circuitry. Connect \nthe AGND and PGND pins to the ground plane using vias right next to the bypass capacitors. PGND pin is \nconnected to the source of the internal LS switch. They must be connected directly to the grounds of the input \nand output capacitors. The PGND net contains noise at switching frequency and may bounce due to load \nvariations. PGND trace, as well as VIN and SW traces, must be constrained to one side of the ground plane. The \nother side of the ground plane contains much less noise and should be used for sensitive routes.\nTI also recommends providing adequate device heat sinking by utilizing the PAD of the device as the primary \nthermal path. Use a minimum 4 by 2 array of 12 mil thermal vias to connect the PAD to the system ground plane \nheat sink. The vias should be evenly distributed under the PAD. Use as much copper as possible, for system \nground plane, on the top and bottom layers for the best heat dissipation. Use a four-layer board with the copper \nthickness for the four layers, starting from the top of, 2 oz / 1 oz / 1 oz / 2 oz. Four-layer boards with enough \ncopper thickness provides low current conduction impedance, proper shielding, and lower thermal resistance.\nThe thermal characteristics of the LMR23630 are specified using the parameter R θJA, which characterize the \njunction temperature of silicon to the ambient temperature in a specific system. Although the value of R θJA is \ndependent on many variables, it still can be used to approximate the operating junction temperature of the \ndevice. To obtain an estimate of the device junction temperature, one may use the following relationship:\nTJ = P D × R θJA + T A (23)\nPD = V IN × IIN × (1 – Efficiency) – 1.1 × I OUT 2 × DCR in watt (24)\nwhere\n•TJ = junction temperature in °C\n•PD = device power dissipation in watt\n•RθJA = junction-to-ambient thermal resistance of the device in °C/W\n•TA = ambient temperature in °C\n•DCR = inductor DC parasitic resistance in ohm\nThe maximum operating junction temperature of the LMR23630 is 125°C. R θJA is highly related to PCB size and \nlayout, as well as environmental factors such as heat sinking and air flow.LMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n11.5 Feedback Resistors\nTo reduce noise sensitivity of the output voltage feedback path, it is important to place the resistor divider and \nCFF close to the FB pin, rather than close to the load. The FB pin is the input to the error amplifier, so it is a high \nimpedance node and very sensitive to noise. Placing the resistor divider and C FF closer to the FB pin reduces \nthe trace length of FB signal and reduces noise coupling. The output node is a low impedance node, so the trace \nfrom V OUT to the resistor divider can be long if short path is not available.\nIf voltage accuracy at the load is important, make sure voltage sense is made at the load. Doing so corrects \nfor voltage drops along the traces and provide the best output accuracy. The voltage sense trace from the \nload to the feedback resistor divider should be routed away from the SW node path and the inductor to \navoid contaminating the feedback signal with switch noise, while also minimizing the trace length. This is most \nimportant when high value resistors are used to set the output voltage. TI recommends routing the voltage sense \ntrace and place the resistor divider on a different layer than the inductor and SW node path, such that there is a \nground plane in between the feedback trace and inductor/SW node polygon. This provides further shielding for \nthe voltage feedback path from EMI noises.www.ti.comLMR23630\nSNVSAH2E – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: LMR23630\n12 Device and Documentation Support\n12.1 Device Support\n12.1.1 Development Support\n12.1.1.1 Custom Design With WEBENCH ® Tools\nClick here  to create a custom design using the LMR23625 device with the WEBENCH ® Power Designer.\n1.Start by entering the input voltage (V IN), output voltage (V OUT), and output current (I OUT) requirements.\n2.Optimize the design for key parameters such as efficiency, footprint, and cost using the optimizer dial.\n3.Compare the generated design with other possible solutions from Texas Instruments.\nThe WEBENCH Power Designer provides a customized schematic along with a list of materials with real-time \npricing and component availability.\nIn most cases, these actions are available:\n•Run electrical simulations to see important waveforms and circuit performance\n•Run thermal simulations to understand board thermal performance\n•Export customized schematic and layout into popular CAD formats\n•Print PDF reports for the design, and share the design with colleagues\nGet more information about WEBENCH tools at www.ti.com/WEBENCH .\n12.2 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
