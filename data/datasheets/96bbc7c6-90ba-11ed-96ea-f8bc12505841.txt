- **Current Ratings:**
  - RF Power Input: 37W max at 25°C
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Power handling capability of 7W (derated to 3W at 100°C ambient)
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -55°C to +100°C
- **Storage Temperature Range:**
  - -55°C to +100°C
- **Package Type:**
  - Case Style: FV1206
- **Special Features:**
  - Low cost
  - Small size
  - 7 sections for improved performance
  - Temperature stable
  - LTCC (Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic) construction
  - Hermetically sealed
  - RoHS compliant
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - Not specified in the provided data.

**Typical Applications:**
The HFCN-880D+ is commonly used in:
- Transmitters and receivers for RF communication systems
- Sub-harmonic rejection applications
- Laboratory use for signal processing and testing
