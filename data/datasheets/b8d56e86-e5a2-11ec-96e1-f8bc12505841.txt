The driver output\nconsist ofacompound structure with MOS and bipolar transistor operating inparallel tooptimize current\ncapability over awide output voltage and operating temperature range. The bipolar device provides high peak\ncurrent atthecritical threshold region oftheMOSFET VGS while theMOS devices provide rail-to-rail output\nswing. The totem pole output drives theMOSFET gate between thegate drive supply voltage VCCandthepower\nground potential attheVEEpin.\nThe control inputs ofthedrivers arehigh impedance CMOS buffers with TTL compatible threshold voltages. The\nLM5111 pinout was designed forcompatibility with industry standard gate drivers insingle supply gate driver\napplications.\nThe input stage ofeach driver should bedriven byasignal with ashort riseandfalltime. Slow rising andfalling\ninput signals, although notharmful tothedriver, may result intheoutput switching repeatedly atahigh\nfrequency.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n10LM5111\nSNVS300H –JULY 2004 –REVISED SEPTEMBER 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM5111Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Undervoltage Lockout\nAnundervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit isincluded intheLM5111, which senses thevoltage difference between\nVCCandthechip ground pin,VEE.When theVCCtoVEEvoltage difference falls below 2.8Vboth driver channels\naredisabled. The UVLO hysteresis prevents chattering during brown-out conditions and thedriver resumes\nnormal operation when theVCCtoVEEdifferential voltage exceeds approximately 3V.\nThe LM5111-1, -2,and -3devices hold both outputs inthelowstate intheUVLO condition. The LM5111-4 is\ndistinguished from theLM5111-3 bytheactive high output state ofOUT_A during UVLO. When VCC isless than\ntheUVLO threshold voltage, OUT_A oftheLM5111-4 willbelocked inthehigh state while OUT_B willbe\ndisabled inthelowstate. This configuration allows theLM5111-4 todrive aPFET through OUT_A andanNFET\nthrough OUT_B with both FETs safely turned offduring UVLO.\n8.3.2 Output Stage\nThe twodriver channels oftheLM5111 aredesigned asidentical cells. Transistor matching inherent tointegrated\ncircuit manufacturing ensures that theACand DCpeformance ofthechannels arenearly identical. Closely\nmatched propagation delays allow thedual driver tobeoperated asasingle with inputs and output pins\nconnected. The drive current capability inparallel operation isprecisely 2×thedrive ofanindividual channel.\nSmall differences inswitching speed between thedriver channels willproduce atransient current (shoot-through)\nintheoutput stage when twooutput pins areconnected todrive asingle load. Differences ininput thresholds\nbetween thedriver channels willalso produce atransient current (shoot-through) intheoutput stage. Fast\ntransition input signals areespecially important while operating inaparallel configuration. The efficiency loss for\nparallel operation has been characterized atvarious loads, supply voltages and operating frequencies. The\npower dissipation intheLM5111 increases beless than 1%relative tothedual driver configuration when\noperated asasingle driver with inputs/ outputs connected.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nTable 2.Input/output Logic Table\nLM5111-1M LM5111-2M LM5111-3M/LM5111-4M\nINA INB OUT A OUT B INA INB OUT A OUT B INA INB OUT A OUT B\nL L L L L L H H L L H L\nL H L H L H H L L H H H\nH L H L H L L H H L L L\nH H H H H H L L H H L H\nInUVLO L L InUVLO L L InUVLO L/H L/L\nLM5111\nINBINA\n0.1 µF\n1.0 µFN/C\nINA2\nVEE3\nINB47\n6\n58 N/C\nOUTA\nVCC\nOUTB1\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n11LM5111\nwww.ti.com SNVS300H –JULY 2004 –REVISED SEPTEMBER 2016\nProduct Folder Links: LM5111Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated9Application andImplementation\nNOTE\nInformation inthe following applications sections isnot part ofthe TIcomponent\nspecification, and TIdoes notwarrant itsaccuracy orcompleteness. TI’scustomers are\nresponsible fordetermining suitability ofcomponents fortheir purposes. Customers should\nvalidate andtesttheir design implementation toconfirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nHigh-frequency power supplies often require high-speed, high-current drivers such astheLM5111 family. A\nleading application istheneed toprovide ahigh-power buffer stage between thePWM output ofthecontrol IC\nandthegates oftheprimary power MOSFET orIGBT switching devices. Inother cases, thedriver ICisused to\ndrive thepower-device gates through adrive transformer. Synchronous rectification supplies arealso needed to\nsimultaneously drive multiple devices which presents anextremely large load tothecontrol circuitry.\nDriver ICsareused when useoftheprimary PWM regulator ICtodirectly drive theswitching devices foroneor\nmore reasons isnotfeasible. The PWMIC does nothave thebrute drive capability required fortheintended\nswitching MOSFET, limiting theswitching performance intheapplication. Inother cases, there may beadesire\ntominimize theeffect ofhigh-frequency switching noise byplacing thehigh current driver physically close tothe\nload. Also, newer ICsthattarget thehighest operating frequencies donotincorporate onboard gate drivers atall.\nTheir PWM outputs areonly intended todrive thehigh impedance input toadriver such astheUCCx732x.\nFinally, thecontrol ICisunder thermal stress due topower dissipation, and anexternal driver helps bymoving\ntheheat from thecontroller toanexternal package.\n9.2 Typical Application\nFigure 12.LM5111 Driving Two Independent MOSFETs\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nToselect theproper device from theLM5111 family, TIrecommends firstchecking theappropriate logic forthe\noutputs. LM5111 has dual inverting outputs; dual noninverting outputs; inverting channel Aand noninverting\nchannel B.Refer tooperating modes toselect which driver from thefamily isrequired inagiven application.\nMoreover, some design considerations must beevaluated firstinorder tomake themost appropriate selection.\nAmong these considerations areVCC andpower dissipation.\n1 10 100 1000\nFREQUENCY (kHz)0.1110100SUPPLY CURRENT \n(mA)VCC = 15V\nVCC = 10V\nVCC = 5V\nTA = 25°C\nCL = 2200pF\n1001\n1k100\n10k\nCAPACITIVE LOAD (pF)0.1101000SUPPLY CURRENT (mA\n) f = 500kHz\nf = 100kHz\nf = 10kHzTA = 25°C\nVCC = 12V\n12LM5111\nSNVS300H –JULY 2004 –REVISED SEPTEMBER 2016 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM5111Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedTypical Application (continued)\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n9.2.2.1 VCC\nAlthough quiescent VCC current isvery low, total supply current willbehigher, depending onOUTA and OUTB\ncurrent andtheprogrammed oscillator frequency. Total VCC current isthesum ofquiescent VCC current andthe\naverage OUT current. Knowing theoperating frequency and theMOSFET gate charge (Qg),average OUT\ncurrent canbecalculated using Equation 1.\nIOUT=Qg×f\nwhere\n•fisfrequency (1)\nForthebest high-speed circuit performance, twoVCC bypass capacitors arerecommended toprevent noise\nproblems. The useofsurface mount components ishighly recommended. A0.1-µFceramic capacitor should be\nlocated closest totheVDD toground connection. Inaddition, alarger capacitor (such as1µFand above) with\nrelatively lowESR should beconnected inparallel, tohelp deliver thehigh current peaks totheload. The parallel\ncombination ofcapacitors should present alowimpedance characteristic fortheexpected current levels inthe\ndriver application.\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 13.Supply Current vsFrequency Figure 14.Supply Current vsCapacitive Load\n13LM5111\nwww.ti.com SNVS300H –JULY 2004 –REVISED SEPTEMBER 2016\nProduct Folder Links: LM5111Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated10Power Supply Recommendations\n10.1 Bias Supply Voltage\nThe recommended bias supply voltage range forLM5111 isfrom 3.5Vto14V.The upper end ofthisrange is\ndriven bythe15-V absolute maximum voltage rating oftheVCC. TIrecommends keeping proper margin toallow\nfortransient voltage spikes. Alocal bypass capacitor must beplaced between theVCC and VEE pins, and this\ncapacitor must beplaced asclose tothedevice aspossible. TIrecommends alowESR, ceramic surface mount\ncapacitor. TIrecommends using 2capacitors across VCC and VEE: a100-nF ceramic surface-mount capacitor\nforhigh frequency filtering placed very close toVCC andVEE pin,andanother surface-mount capacitor, 220nF\nto10µF,forICbias requirements.\n11Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nAttention must begiven toboard layout when using LM5111. Some important considerations include:\n•ALow ESR/ESL capacitor must beconnected close totheICand between theVCCand VEEpins tosupport\nhigh peak currents being drawn from VCCduring turnon oftheMOSFET.\n•Proper grounding iscrucial. The drivers need avery lowimpedance path forcurrent return toground avoiding\ninductive loops. The twopaths forreturning current toground area)between LM5111 VEEpinandtheground\nofthecircuit that controls thedriver inputs, b)between LM5111 VEEpinand thesource ofthepower\nMOSFET being driven.

The junction temperature isestimated based onthepower\ndissipated intheICandthejunction toambient thermal resistance θJAfortheICpackage intheapplication board\nand environment.

Q1andQ2arethe\nswitches within thegate driver. RGisthegate resistance oftheexternal MOSFET, andCINistheequivalent gate\ncapacitance oftheMOSFET. The gate resistance Rgisusually very small andlosses initcanbeneglected. The\nequivalent gate capacitance isadifficult parameter tomeasure since itisthecombination ofCGS(gate tosource\ncapacitance) and CGD(gate todrain capacitance). Both ofthese MOSFET capacitances arenotconstants and\nvary with thegate and drain voltage. The better way ofquantifying gate capacitance isthetotal gate charge QG\nincoulombs. QGcombines thecharge required byCGSandCGDforagiven gate drive voltage VGATE.\nAssuming negligible gate resistance, thetotal power dissipated intheMOSFET driver due togate charge is\napproximated by\nPDRIVER =VGATE ×QG×FSW\nwhere\n•FSW=switching frequency oftheMOSFET (2)\nForexample, consider theMOSFET MTD6N15 whose gate charge specified as30nCforVGATE =12V.\nThe power dissipation inthedriver due tocharging and discharging ofMOSFET gate capacitances atswitching\nfrequency of300kHz andVGATE of12Visequal to\nPDRIVER =12V×30nC×300kHz =0.108 W. (3)\nIfboth channels oftheLM5111 areoperating atequal frequency with equivalent loads, thetotal losses willbe\ntwice asthisvalue which is0.216 W.\nInaddition totheabove gate charge power dissipation, transient power isdissipated inthedriver during output\ntransitions. When either output oftheLM5111 changes state, current willflow from VCCtoVEEforavery brief\ninterval oftime through theoutput totem-pole Nand Pchannel MOSFETs. The final component ofpower\ndissipation inthedriver isthepower associated with thequiescent bias current consumed bythedriver input\nstage andUnder-voltage lockout sections.\nCharacterization oftheLM5111 provides accurate estimates ofthetransient and quiescent power dissipation\ncomponents. At300-kHz switching frequency and30-nC load used intheexample, thetransient power willbe8\nmW. The 1-mA nominal quiescent current and12-V VGATE supply produce a12-mW typical quiescent power.\nTherefore thetotal power dissipation\nPD=0.216 +0.008 +0.012 =0.236 W.

Inapplications requiring\ncontinuous load current (resistive orinductive loads), package power dissipation, limits theLM5111 current\ncapability farbelow the5-A sink and 3-A source capability.

Iftheambient temperature (TA)is60°C,andtheRDS(on) oftheLM5111 output atTJ(max) is2.5\nΩ,thisequation yields ISINK(max) of391mAwhich ismuch smaller than 5-Apeak pulsed currents.\nSimilarly, themaximum continuous source current canbecalculated as\nwhere\n•VDIODE isthevoltage drop across hybrid output stage which varies over temperature andcanbeassumed to\nbeabout 1.1VatTJ(max) of125°C (9)\nAssuming thesame parameters asabove, thisequation yields ISOURCE (max) of347mA.\n17LM5111\nwww.ti.com SNVS300H –JULY 2004 –REVISED SEPTEMBER 2016\nProduct Folder Links: LM5111Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated12Device andDocumentation Support\n12.1 Receiving Notification ofDocumentation Updates\nToreceive notification ofdocumentation updates, navigate tothedevice product folder onti.com.
