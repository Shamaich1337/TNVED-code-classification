It utilizes superbeta\nbipolar input transistors to achieve picoampere input bias currentlevels (similar to FET input amplifiers at room temperature),while its I\nB typically only increases by 5 /H11003 at 125 °C (unlike a\nJFET amp, for which I B doubles every 10 °C for a 1000 /H11003\nincrease at 125 °C). The AD706 also achieves the microvolt\noffset voltage and low noise characteristics of a precision bipolarinput amplifier.\nSince it has < 200 pA of bias current, the AD706 does not\nrequire the commonly used “balancing” resistor. Further more,\nthe current noise is only 50 fA/ √Hz, which makes this amplifier\nusable with very high source impedances. At 600 /H9262A max supply\ncurrent (per amplifier), the AD706 is well suited for today’s\nhigh density boards.\nThe AD706 is an excellent choice for use in low frequency\nactive filters in 12-bit and 14-bit data acquisition systems, in\nprecision instrumentation, and as a high quality integrator. The\nAD706 is internally compensated for unity gain and is availablein five performance grades. The AD706J is rated over the\ncommercial temperature range of 0 °C to +70 °C. The AD706A is\nrated for the extended industrial temperature range of –40 °C\nto +85 °C.\nThe AD706 is offered in two varieties of an 8-lead package:  \nPDIP and surface-mount (SOIC).PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1.The AD706 is a dual low drift op amp that offers JFET\nlevel input bias currents, yet has the low I B drift of a bipolar\namplifier. It may be used in circuits using dual op amps\nsuch as the LT1024.\n2. The AD706 provides both low drift and high dc precision.\n3. The AD706 can be used in applications where a chopper\namplifier would normally be required but without the\nchopper’s inherent noise.\nTEMPERATURE – /H11543C100\n0.01 TYPICAL IB – nA\n1\n0.110\n–55 +125 +25 +110TYPICAL JFET AMP\nAD706\nFigure 1.
