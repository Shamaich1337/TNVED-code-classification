Each switch is controlled by a \nlogic enable input. Gate drive is provided by an \ninternal charge pump designed to control the power-\nswitch rise times and fall times to minimize current \nsurges during switching. The charge pump requires \nno external components and allows operation from \nsupplies as low as 2.7 V.\nWhen the output load exceeds the current-limit \nthreshold or a short is present, the device limits the \noutput current to a safe level by switching into a \nconstant-current mode, pulling the overcurrent ( OCx) \nlogic output low. When continuous heavy overloads \nand short circuits increase the power dissipation in \nthe switch, causing the junction temperature to rise, \na thermal protection circuit shuts off the switch to \nprevent damage. Recovery from a thermal shutdown \nis automatic once the device has cooled sufficiently. \nInternal circuitry ensures that the switch remains \noff until valid input voltage is present. This power-\ndistribution switch is designed to set current limit at \n1 A (typical).\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS20xxBSOIC (8) 4.90 mm × 3.91 mm\nSOIC (16) 9.90 mm × 3.91 mm\nSOT-23 (5) 2.90 mm × 1.60 mm\nHVSSOP (8) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\nSON (8) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nIN\nOC1\nEN1\nOC22\n8\n57\n0.1 µF 22 µF\n0.1 µF 22 µFLoad\nLoadOUT1\nOUT2Power Supply\n2.7 V to 5.5 V\n6\nEN23\n4\nGND0.1 µFTPS2042B\n1\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nTypical Application SchematicTPS2041B , TPS2042B , TPS2043B , TPS2044B\nTPS2051B , TPS2052B , TPS2053B , TPS2054B\nSLVS514N  – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Functional Block Diagram (TPS2044B and TPS2054B)\n9.3 Feature Description\n9.3.1 Power Switch\nThe power switch is an N-channel MOSFET with a low on-state resistance. Configured as a high-side switch, the \npower switch prevents current flow from OUT to IN and IN to OUT when disabled. The power switch supplies a \nminimum current of 500 mA.\nwww.ti.comTPS2041B, TPS2042B, TPS2043B, TPS2044B\nTPS2051B, TPS2052B, TPS2053B, TPS2054B\nSLVS514N – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2041B  TPS2042B  TPS2043B  TPS2044B  TPS2051B  TPS2052B  TPS2053B  TPS2054B\n9.3.2 Charge Pump\nAn internal charge pump supplies power to the driver circuit and provides the necessary voltage to pull the gate \nof the MOSFET above the source. The charge pump operates from input voltages as low as 2.7 V and requires \nlittle supply current.\n9.3.3 Driver\nThe driver controls the gate voltage of the power switch. To limit large current surges and reduce the associated \nelectromagnetic interference (EMI) produced, the driver incorporates circuitry that controls the rise times and fall \ntimes of the output voltage.\n9.3.4 Enable ( ENx)\nThe logic enable pin disables the power switch and the bias for the charge pump, driver, and other circuitry to \nreduce the supply current. The supply current is reduced to less than 1 µA or 2 µA when a logic high is present \non EN. A logic zero input on EN restores bias to the drive and control circuits and turns the switch on. The \nenable input is compatible with both TTL and CMOS logic levels.\n9.3.5 Enable (ENx)\nThe logic enable disables the power switch and the bias for the charge pump, driver, and other circuitry to \nreduce the supply current. The supply current is reduced to less than 1 μA or 2 μA when a logic low is present \non ENx. A logic high input on ENx restores bias to the drive and control circuits and turns the switch on. The \nenable input is compatible with both TTL and CMOS logic levels.\n9.3.6 Current Sense\nA sense FET monitors the current supplied to the load. The sense FET measures current more efficiently than \nconventional resistance methods. When an overload or short circuit is encountered, the current-sense circuitry \nsends a control signal to the driver. The driver in turn reduces the gate voltage and drives the power FET into its \nsaturation region, which switches the output into a constant-current mode and holds the current constant while \nvarying the voltage on the load.\n9.3.7 Overcurrent\nA sense FET is employed to check for overcurrent conditions. Unlike current-sense resistors, sense FETs do \nnot increase the series resistance of the current path. When an overcurrent condition is detected, the device \nmaintains a constant output current and reduces the output voltage accordingly. Complete shutdown occurs only \nif the fault is present long enough to activate thermal limiting.\nThere are two kinds of current limit profiles for the TPS20xxB family of devices.\nAll devices (excluding TPS2051BDBV and TPS2051BD) have an output I vs V characteristic similar to the plot \nlabeled Current Limit with Peaking  in Figure 9-5 . This type of limiting can be characterized by two parameters, \nthe overcurrent trip threshold (I OC), and the short-circuit output current threshold (I OS).\nDevices TPS2051BDBV and TPS2052BD have an output I vs V characteristic similar to the plot labeled Flat \nCurrent Limit  in Figure 9-5 . This type of limiting can be characterized by one parameters, the short circuit \ncurrent (I OS).\nVOUT\nIOUTIOSDecreasing\nLoad\nResistanceVIN\n0 A0 VSlope = -R DS(ON)\nVOUT\nIOUT IOSDecreasing\nLoad\nResistanceVIN\n0 A0 VSlope = -R DS(ON)\nIOCCurrent Limit\nwith PeakingFlat Current\nLimit\nFigure 9-5.

In the first \ncondition, the output has been shorted before the device is enabled or before V I(IN) has been applied (see Figure \n7-23 through Figure 7-26 ). The TPS20xxB senses the short and immediately switches into a constant-current \noutput.\nIn the second condition, a short or an overload occurs while the device is enabled. At the instant the overload \noccurs, high currents may flow for a short period of time before the current-limit circuit can react. After the \ncurrent-limit circuit has tripped (reached the overcurrent trip threshold (I OC)), the device switches into constant-\ncurrent mode and current is limited at the short-circuit output current threshold (I OS).\nIn the third condition, the load has been gradually increased beyond the recommended operating current. The \ncurrent is permitted to rise until the overcurrent trip threshold (I OC) is reached or until the thermal limit of the \ndevice is exceeded. The TPS20xxB is capable of delivering current up to the current-limit threshold without \ndamaging the device. Once the overcurrent trip threshold (I OC) has been reached, the device switches into its \nconstant-current mode current is limited at the short-circuit output current threshold (I OS).\n9.3.7.2 Overcurrent Conditions (TPS2051BDBV, TPS2052BD)\nThree possible overload conditions can occur for TPS2051BDBV, TPS2052BD. In the first condition, the output \nhas been shorted before the device is enabled or before V I(IN) has been applied (see Figure 7-44  through Figure \n7-47). The TPS20xxB senses the short and immediately switches into a constant-current output.\nIn the second condition, a short or an overload occurs while the device is enabled. At the instant the overload \noccurs, high currents may flow for a short period of time before the current-limit circuit can react. After the \nshort-circuit output current threshold (I OS) is reached, the device switches into constant-current mode.\nIn the third condition, the load has been gradually increased beyond the recommended operating current. After \nthe short-circuit output current threshold (I OS) is reached, the device switches into constant-current mode.\n9.3.8 Overcurrent ( OCx)\nThe OCx open-drain output is asserted (active low) when an overcurrent or overtemperature condition is \nencountered. The output remains asserted until the overcurrent or overtemperature condition is removed. A 10-\nms deglitch circuit prevents the OCx signal from oscillation or false triggering. If an overtemperature shutdown \noccurs, the OCx is asserted instantaneously.\n9.3.9 Thermal Sense\nThe TPS20xxB implements a thermal sensing to monitor the operating temperature of the power distribution \nswitch. In an overcurrent or short-circuit condition, the junction temperature rises. When the die temperature \nrises to approximately 140°C due to overcurrent conditions, the internal thermal sense circuitry turns off the \nswitch, thus preventing the device from damage. Hysteresis is built into the thermal sense, and after the \ndevice has cooled approximately 10 degrees, the switch turns back on. The switch continues to cycle off and \non until the fault is removed. The open-drain false reporting output ( OCx) is asserted (active low) when an \novertemperature shutdown or overcurrent occurs.\n9.3.10 Undervoltage Lockout\nA voltage sense circuit monitors the input voltage. When the input voltage is below approximately 2 V, a control \nsignal turns off the power switch.\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\nThere are no other functional modes for TPS20xxB devices.\nwww.ti.comTPS2041B, TPS2042B, TPS2043B, TPS2044B\nTPS2051B, TPS2052B, TPS2053B, TPS2054B\nSLVS514N – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2041B  TPS2042B  TPS2043B  TPS2044B  TPS2051B  TPS2052B  TPS2053B  TPS2054B\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\n10.1.1 Universal Serial Bus (USB) Applications\nThe universal serial bus (USB) interface is a 12-Mb/s, or 1.5-Mb/s, multiplexed serial bus designed for low-to-\nmedium bandwidth PC peripherals (for example, keyboards, printers, scanners, and mice). The four-wire USB \ninterface is conceived for dynamic attach-detach (hot plug-unplug) of peripherals. Two lines are provided for \ndifferential data, and two lines are provided for 5-V power distribution.\nUSB data is a 3.3-V level signal, but power is distributed at 5 V to allow for voltage drops in cases where power \nis distributed through more than one hub across long cables. Each function must provide its own regulated 3.3 V \nfrom the 5-V input or its own internal power supply.\nThe USB specification defines the following five classes of devices, each differentiated by power-consumption \nrequirements:\n•Hosts and self-powered hubs (SPH)\n•Bus-powered hubs (BPH)\n•Low-power, bus-powered functions\n•High-power, bus-powered functions\n•Self-powered functions\nSelf-powered and bus-powered hubs distribute data and power to downstream functions. The TPS20xxB can \nprovide power-distribution solutions to many of these classes of devices.\n10.2 Typical Application\n10.2.1 Typical Application (TPS2042B)\nIN\nOC1\nEN1\nOC22\n8\n57\n0.1 µF 22 µF\n0.1 µF 22 µFLoad\nLoadOUT1\nOUT2Power Supply\n2.7 V to 5.5 V\n6\nEN23\n4\nGND0.1 µFTPS2042B\n1\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 10-1.

This precaution reduces power-supply transients that may cause ringing on the input. Additionally, \nbypassing the output with a 0.01- μF to 0.1- μF ceramic capacitor improves the immunity of the device to \nshort-circuit transients.\n10.2.1.2.2 OC Response\nThe OCx open-drain output is asserted (active low) when an overcurrent or overtemperature shutdown \ncondition is encountered after a 10-ms deglitch timeout. The output remains asserted until the overcurrent or \novertemperature condition is removed. Connecting a heavy capacitive load to an enabled device can cause a \nmomentary overcurrent condition; however, no false reporting on OCx occurs due to the 10-ms deglitch circuit. \nThe TPS20xxB is designed to eliminate false overcurrent reporting. The internal overcurrent deglitch eliminates \nthe need for external components to remove unwanted pulses. OCx is not deglitched when the switch is turned \noff due to an overtemperature shutdown.\nGND\nIN\nEN1\nEN2OC1\nOC2OUT1\nOUT2TPS2042BRpullupV+\nFigure 10-2.

This power supply must provide from 5.25 V to 4.75 \nV to the board side of the downstream connection under full-load and no-load conditions. Hosts and SPHs are \nrequired to have current-limit protection and must report overcurrent conditions to the USB controller.

Hybrid Self and Bus-Powered Hub Implementation, TPS2044B and TPS2054B\n10.2.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nBus-powered hubs obtain all power from upstream ports and often contain an embedded function. The hubs are \nrequired to power up with less than one unit load. The BPH usually has one embedded function, and power is \nalways available to the controller of the hub. If the embedded function and hub require more than 100 mA on \npower up, the power to the embedded function may need to be kept off until enumeration is completed. This \ncan be accomplished by removing power or by shutting off the clock to the embedded function. Power switching \nthe embedded function is not necessary if the aggregate power draw for the function and controller is less than \none unit load. The total current drawn by the bus-powered device is the sum of the current to the controller, the \nembedded function, and the downstream ports, and it is limited to 500 mA from an upstream port.\n10.2.2.2.1 Low-Power Bus-Powered and High-Power Bus-Powered Functions\nBoth low-power and high-power bus-powered functions obtain all power from upstream ports; low-power \nfunctions always draw less than 100 mA; high-power functions must draw less than 100 mA at power up and can \ndraw up to 500 mA after enumeration. If the load of the function is more than the parallel combination of 44 Ω \nand 10 μF at power up, the device must implement inrush current limiting (see Figure 10-17 ).\nwww.ti.comTPS2041B, TPS2042B, TPS2043B, TPS2044B\nTPS2051B, TPS2052B, TPS2053B, TPS2054B\nSLVS514N – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2041B  TPS2042B  TPS2043B  TPS2044B  TPS2051B  TPS2052B  TPS2053B  TPS2054B\nIN\nOC1\nOC22\n8\n3\n5\n47\n0.1 µF 10 µFInternal\nFunctionOUT1Power Supply\n3.3 V\nEN1\n6\n0.1 µF 10 µFOUT2 Internal\nFunction0.1 µF 10 µF\nUSB\nControlGNDVBUSD−D+\nEN2\nGND\n1TPS2042B\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFigure 10-17.

Such implementations require the control of current surges seen \nby the main power supply and the card being inserted. The most effective way to control these surges is to \nlimit and slowly ramp the current and voltage being applied to the card, similar to the way in which a power \nsupply normally turns on. Due to the controlled rise times and fall times of the TPS20xxB, these devices can be \nused to provide a softer start-up to devices being hot-plugged into a powered system. The UVLO feature of the \nTPS20xxB also ensures that the switch is off after the card has been removed, and that the switch is off during \nthe next insertion. The UVLO feature insures a soft start with a controlled rise time for every insertion of the card \nor module.\nwww.ti.comTPS2041B, TPS2042B, TPS2043B, TPS2044B\nTPS2051B, TPS2052B, TPS2053B, TPS2054B\nSLVS514N – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 33\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2041B  TPS2042B  TPS2043B  TPS2044B  TPS2051B  TPS2052B  TPS2053B  TPS2054B\nPower\nSupply\n0.1 µF1000 µF\nOptimum2.7 V to 5.5 VPC Board\nOvercurrent ResponseTPS2042B\nOC1 GND\nEN1IN\nEN2OUT1\nOUT2\nOC2\nBlock of\nCircuitryBlock of\nCircuitry\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFigure 10-26. Typical Hot-Plug Implementation (Example, TPS2042B) \nBy placing the TPS20xxB between the V CC input and the rest of the circuitry, the input power reaches \nthese devices first after insertion. The typical rise time of the switch is approximately 1 ms, providing a slow \nvoltage ramp at the output of the device. This implementation controls system surge currents and provides a \nhot-plugging mechanism for any device.\n10.2.3.1 Design Requirements\nTable 10-2  shows the design parameters for this application.\nTable 10-2. Design Parameters\nDESIGN PARAMETER VALUE\nInput voltage 5 V\nOutput1 voltage 5 V\nOutput2 voltage 5 V\nOutput1 current 0.5 A\nOutput2 current 0.5 A\n10.2.3.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nTo begin the design process a few parameters must be decided upon. The designer needs to know the following:\n•Normal Input Operation Voltage\n•Current Limit\nInput and output capacitance improves the performance of the device; the actual capacitance should be \noptimized for the particular application. For all applications, TI recommends a 0.1-µF or greater ceramic bypass \ncapacitor between IN and GND, as close to the device as possible for local noise decoupling. This precaution \nreduces ringing on the input due to power-supply transients. Additional input capacitance may be needed \non the input to reduce voltage undershoot from exceeding the UVLO of other load share one power rail \nwith TPS2042 device or overshoot from exceeding the absolute-maximum voltage of the device during heavy \ntransient conditions. This is especially important during bench testing when long, inductive cables are used to \nconnect the evaluation board to the bench power supply. Output capacitance is not required, but TI recommends \nplacing a high-value electrolytic capacitor on the output pin when large transient currents are expected on the \noutput to reduce the undershoot, which is caused by the inductance of the output power bus just after a short \nhas occurred and the TPS2042 device has abruptly reduced OUT current. Energy stored in the inductance will \ndrive the OUT voltage down and potentially negative as it discharges.TPS2041B, TPS2042B, TPS2043B, TPS2044B\nTPS2051B, TPS2052B, TPS2053B, TPS2054B\nSLVS514N – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\n www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2041B  TPS2042B  TPS2043B  TPS2044B  TPS2051B  TPS2052B  TPS2053B  TPS2054B\n10.2.3.3 Application Curves\nVI(EN)\nVI(EN)\n5 V/div\nVO(OUT)\n2 V/div\nRL= 10 Ω ,\nCL= 1µF\nTA= 25°C\nt−Time −500µs/div\nFigure 10-27.

Whenever the input \nvoltage falls below approximately 2 V, the power switch is quickly turned off. This facilitates the design of \nhot-insertion systems where it is not possible to turn off the power switch before input power is removed. The \nUVLO also keeps the switch from being turned on until the power supply has reached at least 2 V, even if the \nswitch is enabled. On reinsertion, the power switch is turned on, with a controlled rise time to reduce EMI and \nvoltage overshoots.\nwww.ti.comTPS2041B, TPS2042B, TPS2043B, TPS2044B\nTPS2051B, TPS2052B, TPS2053B, TPS2054B\nSLVS514N – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 37\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2041B  TPS2042B  TPS2043B  TPS2044B  TPS2051B  TPS2052B  TPS2053B  TPS2054B\n12 Layout\n12.1 Layout Guidelines\n•Place the 100-nF bypass capacitor near the IN and GND pins, and make the connections using a low-\ninductance trace.\n•Placing a high-value electrolytic capacitor and a 100-nF bypass capacitor on the output pin is recommended \nwhen large transient currents are expected on the output.\n•The PowerPAD should be directly connected to PCB ground plane using wide and short copper trace.\n12.2 Layout Example\nFigure 12-1. Layout Recommendation\n12.3 Power Dissipation\nThe low on-resistance on the N-channel MOSFET allows the small surface-mount packages to pass large \ncurrents. The thermal resistances of these packages are high compared to those of power packages; it is good \ndesign practice to check power dissipation and junction temperature. Begin by determining the r DS(on)  of the \nN-channel MOSFET relative to the input voltage and operating temperature. As an initial estimate, use the \nhighest operating ambient temperature of interest and read r DS(on)  from Figure 7-13 . Using this value, the power \ndissipation per switch can be calculated by Equation :\nPD = rDS(on)  × I2\nMultiply this number by the number of switches being used. This step renders the total power dissipation from \nthe N-channel MOSFETs.\nFinally, calculate the junction temperature with Equation :\nTJ = P D × R θJA + T A\nwhere\n•TA= Ambient temperature °C\n•RθJA = Thermal resistance\n•PD = Total power dissipation based on number of switches being used.\nCompare the calculated junction temperature with the initial estimate. If they do not agree within a few degrees, \nrepeat the calculation, using the calculated value as the new estimate. Two or three iterations are generally \nsufficient to get a reasonable answer.\n12.4 Thermal Protection\nThermal protection prevents damage to the IC when heavy-overload or short-circuit faults are present for \nextended periods of time. The TPS20xxB implements a thermal sensing to monitor the operating junction \ntemperature of the power distribution switch. In an overcurrent or short-circuit condition, the junction temperature TPS2041B, TPS2042B, TPS2043B, TPS2044B\nTPS2051B, TPS2052B, TPS2053B, TPS2054B\nSLVS514N – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\n www.ti.com\n38 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2041B  TPS2042B  TPS2043B  TPS2044B  TPS2051B  TPS2052B  TPS2053B  TPS2054B\nrises due to excessive power dissipation. Once the die temperature rises to approximately 140°C due to \novercurrent conditions, the internal thermal sense circuitry turns the power switch off, thus preventing the \npower switch from damage. Hysteresis is built into the thermal sense circuit, and after the device has cooled \napproximately 10°C, the switch turns back on. The switch continues to cycle in this manner until the load fault or \ninput power is removed. The OCx open-drain output is asserted (active low) when an overtemperature shutdown \nor overcurrent occurs.\nwww.ti.comTPS2041B, TPS2042B, TPS2043B, TPS2044B\nTPS2051B, TPS2052B, TPS2053B, TPS2054B\nSLVS514N – JUNE 2010 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 39\nProduct Folder Links: TPS2041B  TPS2042B  TPS2043B  TPS2044B  TPS2051B  TPS2052B  TPS2053B  TPS2054B\n13 Device and Documentation Support\n13.1 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
