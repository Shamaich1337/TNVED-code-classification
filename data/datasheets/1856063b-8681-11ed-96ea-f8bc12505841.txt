The part has been speciﬁ  cally designed to drive 12-, 14- and \n16-bit ADCs with low noise and low distortion, but can also be used as a general-purpose broadband gain block.\nThe LTC6401-14 is easy to use, with minimal support \ncircuitry required. The output common mode voltage is set using an external pin, independent of the inputs, which eliminates the need for transformers or AC-coupling ca-pacitors in many applications. The gain is internally ﬁ  xed \nat 14dB (5V/V).\nThe LTC6401-14 saves space and power compared to \nalternative solutions using IF gain blocks and transform-ers. The LTC6401-14 is packaged in a compact 16-lead 3mm × 3mm QFN package and operates over the –40°C \nto 85°C temperature range.\nEquivalent Output IP3 vs Frequency■ 2GHz –3dB Bandwidth\n■ Fixed Gain of 5V/V (14dB)\n■ –91dBc IMD3 at 70MHz (Equivalent OIP3 = 49.3dBm)\n■ –81dBc IMD3 at 140MHz (Equivalent OIP3 = 44.5dBm)\n■ 1.1nV/√⎯H⎯z Internal Op Amp Noise\n■ 7.3dB Noise Figure\n■ Differential Inputs and Outputs\n■ 200Ω Input Impedance\n■ 2.85V to 3.5V Supply Voltage\n■ 45mA Supply Current (135mW)\n■ 1V to 1.6V Output Common Mode, Adjustable\n■ DC- or AC-Coupled Operation\n■ Max Differential Output Swing 4.6V P-P\n■ Small 16-Lead 3mm × 3mm × 0.75mm QFN Package\n■ Differential ADC Driver\n■ Differential Driver/Receiver\n■ Single Ended to Differential Conversion\n■ IF Sampling Receivers\n■ SAW Filter Interfacing, LT, LTC and LTM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation. \nAll other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\nR2\n29ΩR1\n68.5ΩC4\n0.1μFC3\n0.1μF\n640114 TA01aLTC6401-14 LTC2208RS1\n15ΩC2\n0.1μF\nVINC1\n1000pF3.3V 3.3V\nRS2\n15ΩRS3\n10Ω\nRS4\n10Ω\nR3\n100ΩVOCM\nC5\n0.1μF1.25VCF2\n33pF\nCOILCRAFT\n0603CSCF1\n33pFL1\n24nH\nCF3\n33pFV+\n–IN+IN +OUT\n–OUT\nV–AIN+\nAIN–VCMVDD\nLTC2208\n130Msps\n16-Bit ADC\n0 100 120 140 160 18020 40 60 80 200\nFREQUENCY (MHz)OUTPUT IP3 (dBm)60\n5040\n20\n1030\n0\n640114 TA01b(NOTE 7)\nLTC6401-14\n2640114fABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nSupply Voltage (V+ – V–) ..........................................3.6V\nInput Current (Note 2) ..........................................±10mA\nOperating Temperature Range \n(Note 3) ............................................... –40°C to 85°C\nSpeciﬁ  ed Temperature Range \n(Note 4) ............................................... –40°C to 85°C\nStorage Temperature Range ................... –65°C to 150°CMaximum Junction Temperature .......................... 150°C(Note 1)\n16151413\n5678TOP VIEW\nUD PACKAGE\n16-LEAD (3mm × 3mm) PLASTIC QFN91011\n1712\n4321 V+\nVOCM\nV+\nV–V–\nENABLE\nV+\nV––IN–IN+IN+IN–OUT\n–OUTF+OUTF\n+OUT\nTJMAX = 150°C, θ JA = 68°C/W, θ JC = 4.2°C/W\nEXPOSED PAD (PIN 17) IS V–, MUST BE SOLDERED TO PCB\nLTC6400 AND LTC6401 SELECTOR GUIDE\nPART NUMBER GAIN\n(dB)GAIN\n(V/V)ZIN (DIFFERENTIAL)\n(Ω)ICC\n(mA)\nLTC6401-8 8 2.5 400 45\nLTC6401-14 14 5 200 45\nLTC6401-20 20 10 200 50\nLTC6401-26 26 20 50 45\nLTC6400-8 8 2.5 400 85\nLTC6400-14 14 5 200 85\nLTC6400-20 20 10 200 90\nLTC6400-26 26 20 50 85\nIn addition to the LTC6401 family of ampliﬁ  ers, a lower distortion LTC6400 family is available.

Differential gain and input impedance are set by 200 Ω/500Ω resistors in the feedback network. \nSmall output resistors of 12.5 Ω improve the circuit stability \nover various load conditions. They also provide a possible external ﬁ  ltering option, which is often desirable when the \nload is an ADC.\nFilter resistors of 50 Ω are available for additional ﬁ  ltering. \nLowpass/bandpass ﬁ  lters are easily implemented with just \na couple of external components. Moreover, they offer single-ended 50 Ω matching in wideband applications and \nno external resistor is needed.\nThe LTC6401-14 is very ﬂ  exible in terms of I/O coupling. \nIt can be AC- or DC-coupled at the inputs, the outputs or both. Due to the internal connection between input and output, users are advised to keep input common mode voltage between 1V and 1.6V for proper operation. If the inputs are AC-coupled, the input common mode voltage is automatically biased approximately 250mV above V\nOCM \nand thus no external circuitry is needed for bias. The LTC6401-14 provides an output common mode voltage set by V\nOCM, which allows driving ADC directly without \nexternal components such as transformer or AC coupling capacitors. The input signal can be either single-ended or differential with only minor difference in distortion performance.Input Impedance and Matching\nThe differential input impedance of the LTC6401-14 is \n200Ω. Usually the differential inputs need to be terminated \nto a lower value impedance, e.g. 50 Ω, in order to provide \nan impedance match for the source. Several choices are available. One approach is to use a differential shunt resis-tor (Figure 1). Another approach is to employ a wideband transformer (Figure 2). Both methods provide a wideband match. The termination resistor or the transformer must be placed close to the input pins in order to minimize the reﬂ  ection due to input mismatch. Alternatively, one could apply a narrowband impedance match at the inputs of the LTC6401-14 for frequency selection and/or noise reduction.\nFigure 1.

The signal is fed to one of the inputs through a matching network while the other input is connected to the same matching network and a source resistor. Because the return ratios of the two feedback paths are equal, the two outputs have the same gain and thus symmetrical swing. In general, the single-ended input impedance and termination resistor R\nT are determined by the combination \nof R S, RG and R F. For example, when R S is 50Ω, it is found \nthat the single-ended input impedance is 185 Ω and R T is \n68.5Ω in order to match to a 50 Ω source impedance.Figure 4. Calculate Differential GainAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 3. Input Termination for Single-Ended 50 Ω Input \nImpedanceand noise is obvious when constant noise ﬁ  gure circle \nand constant gain circle are plotted within the input Smith Chart, based on which users can choose the optimal source impedance for a given gain and noise requirement.\nOutput Impedance Match and Filter\nThe LTC6401-14 can drive an ADC directly without external \noutput impedance matching. Alternatively, the differential output impedance of 25 Ω can be made larger, e.g. 50 Ω, \nby series resistors or LC network.\nThe internal low pass ﬁ  lter outputs at +OUTF/–OUTF \nhave a –3dB bandwidth of 590MHz. External capacitors can reduce the lowpass ﬁ  lter bandwidth as shown in \nFigure 5. A bandpass ﬁ  lter is easily implemented with \nFigure 5.

Single-Ended Input to LTC6401-14 and LTC2208\nFigure 8. IMD3 for the Combination of LTC6401-14 and LTC2208Output Common Mode Adjustment\nThe LTC6401-14’s output common mode voltage is set \nby the V OCM pin, which is a high impedance input. The \noutput common mode voltage is capable of tracking V OCM \nin a range from 1V to 1.6V. Bandwidth of V OCM control is \ntypically 14MHz, which is dominated by a low pass ﬁ  lter \nconnected to the V OCM pin and is aimed to reduce com-\nmon mode noise generation at the outputs. The internal common mode feedback loop has a –3dB bandwidth around 400MHz, allowing fast rejection of any common mode output voltage disturbance. The V\nOCM pin should \nbe tied to a DC bias voltage with a 0.1μF bypass capaci-tor. When interfacing with 3V A/D converters such as the LT22xx families, the V\nOCM pin can be connected to the \nVCM pin of the ADC.\nDriving A/D Converters\nThe LTC6401-14 has been speciﬁ  cally designed to interface \ndirectly with high speed A/D converters. Figure 7 shows the LTC6401-14 with single-ended input driving the LTC2208, \nwhich is a 16-bit, 130Msps ADC. Two external 5 Ω resistors \nhelp eliminate potential resonance associated with bond wires of either the ADC input or the driver output. V\nOCM \nof the LTC6401-14 is connected to V CM of the LTC2208 \nat 1.25V. Alternatively, an input single-ended signal can be converted to differential signal via a balun and fed to the input of the LTC6401-14.\nFigure 8 summarizes the IMD3 performance of the whole \nsystem as shown in Figure 7.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n640114 F06IN+ OUT–\nIN– OUT+200Ω 12.5Ω 500ΩLTC6401-14\nLTC2208\n200Ω 500Ω 12.5Ω10Ω\n10Ω4.99Ω\n4.99Ω50Ω50Ω13\n14\n15\n167\n568\n39pF16nH39pF\n+OUT\n+OUTF\n–OUTF\n–OUT+IN\n+IN\n–IN\n–IN1.7pF\n39pF29Ω68.5Ω0.1μF\n0.1μF\n640114 F07LTC6401-14VOCM\nENABLELTC22084.99Ω0.1μF\nLTC2208 130Msps\n16-Bit ADC1.25V\n4.99Ω\n8dB GAIN+OUT\n+OUTF\n–OUTF\n–OUTAIN–\nAIN+VCM\n–IN+IN IF IN\nLTC6401-14\n12640114fTest Circuits\nDue to the fully-differential design of the LTC6401 and \nits usefulness in applications with differing characteristic speciﬁ  cations, two test circuits are used to generate the information in this datasheet. Test Circuit A is DC987B, a two-port demonstration circuit for the LTC6401 family. The silkscreen is shown in Figure 9. This circuit includes input and output transformers (baluns) for single-ended-to-differential conversion and impedance transformation, allowing direct hook-up to a 2-port network analyzer. There are also series resistors at the output to present the LTC6401 with a 375 Ω differential load, optimizing \ndistortion performance. Due to the input and output trans-formers, the –3dB bandwidth is reduced from 1.95GHz to approximately 1.4GHz.\nTest Circuit B uses a 4-port network analyzer to measure \nS-parameters and gain/phase response. This removes the effects of the wideband baluns and associated circuitry, for a true picture of the >1GHz S-parameters and AC characteristics.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 9.
