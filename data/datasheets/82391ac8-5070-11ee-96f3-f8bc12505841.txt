LFCSP ADP151  with Fixed Output Voltage, 1.8 V\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADP151  is an ultralow noise, low dropout (LDO) linear regula-\ntor that operates from 2.2 V to 5.5 V and provides up to 200 mA\nof output current. The low 135 mV dropout voltage at 200 mA load\nimproves efficiency and allows operation over a wide input voltage\nrange.\nUsing an innovative circuit topology, the ADP151  achieves ultralow\nnoise performance without the necessity of a bypass capacitor,\nmaking the device ideal for noise sensitive analog and RF appli-\ncations. The ADP151  also achieves ultralow noise performance\nwithout compromising the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) or\ntransient line and load performance. The low 265 μA of operating\nsupply current at 200 mA load makes the ADP151  suitable for\nbattery-operated portable equipment.\nThe ADP151  includes an internal pull-down resistor on the EN\ninput.\nThe ADP151  is specifically designed for stable operation with\ntiny 1 µF, ±30% ceramic input and output capacitors to meet the\nrequirements of high performance, space constrained applications.\nThe ADP151  is capable of 16 fixed output voltage options, ranging\nfrom 1.1 V to 3.3 V.\nShort-circuit and thermal overload protection circuits prevent dam-\nage in adverse conditions. The ADP151  is available in tiny 5-lead\nTSOT, 6-lead LFCSP, and 4-ball, 0.4 mm pitch, halide-free WLCSP\npackages  for the smallest footprint solution to meet a variety of\nportable power application requirements.\nData Sheet ADP151\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

The ADP151  can be damaged when the junction temperature\nlimits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature does not\nguarantee that TJ is within the specified temperature limits. In appli-\ncations with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the\nmaximum ambient temperature may have to be derated.\nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low printed\ncircuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient tem-\nperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction\ntemperature is within specification limits. TJ of the device is depend-\nent on TA, the power dissipation of the device (PD), and the junction\nto ambient thermal resistance of the package ( θJA).\nTo calculate the maximum TJ from TA and PD use the following\nequation:\n     TJ = TA + (PD × θJA)\nThe θJA of the package is based on modeling and calculation using\na 4-layer board. θJA is highly dependent on the application and\nboard layout. In applications where high maximum PD exists, close\nattention to thermal board design is required. The value of θJA\nmay vary, depending on PCB material, layout, and environmental\nconditions. The specified values of θJA are based on a 4-layer,\n4 inches × 3 inches circuit board. See JESD51-7 and JESD51-9\nfor detailed information on the board construction.

J | 11 of 23The ADP151  is an ultralow noise, low quiescent current, LDO linear\nregulator that operates from 2.2 V to 5.5 V and can provide up to\n200 mA of output current. Drawing a low 265 μA of operating supply\ncurrent (typical) at full load makes the ADP151  ideal for battery\noperated, portable equipment. Shutdown current consumption is\ntypically 0.2 µA.\nUsing a proprietary architecture, the ADP151  provides superior\nnoise performance for noise sensitive analog and RF applications\nwithout the need for a noise bypass capacitor. The ADP151  is also\noptimized for use with small 1 µF ceramic capacitors.\nFigure 27. Internal Block Diagram\nInternally, the ADP151  consists of a reference, an error amplifier,\na feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. Output\ncurrent is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled\nby the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference\nvoltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies\nthe difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than the reference\nvoltage, the gate of the PMOS device pulls lower, allowing more\ncurrent to pass and increasing the output voltage. If the feedback\nvoltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS\ndevice pulls higher, allowing less current to pass and decreasing\nthe output voltage.\nAn internal pull-down resistor on the EN input holds the input low\nwhen the pin is left open.\nThe ADP151  is available in 16 output voltage options, ranging from\n1.1 V to 3.3 V. The ADP151  uses the EN pin to enable and disable\nthe VOUT pin under normal operating conditions. When EN is high,\nVOUT turns on, and when EN is low, VOUT turns off. For automatic\nstartup, tie EN to VIN.\nData Sheet ADP151\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 12 of 23CAPACITOR SELECTION\nOutput Capacitor\nThe ADP151  is designed for operation with small, space-saving\nceramic capacitors but can function with most commonly used\ncapacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the effective\nseries resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor\naffects the stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 1 µF\ncapacitance with an ESR of 1 Ω or less is recommended to ensure\nthe stability of the ADP151 . Transient response to changes in\nload current is also affected by output capacitance. Using a larger\nvalue of output capacitance improves the transient response of the\nADP151  to large changes in load current. Figure 28  shows the\ntransient responses for an output capacitance value of 1 µF.\nFigure 28. Output Transient Response, COUT = 1 µF\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nConnecting a 1 µF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the circuit\nsensitivity to the PCB layout, especially when long input traces\nor high source impedance are encountered. If greater than 1 µF\nof output capacitance is required, the input capacitor must be\nincreased to match it.\nInput and Output Capacitor Properties\nAny good quality ceramic capacitor can be used with the ADP151\nas long as the capacitor meets the minimum capacitance and\nmaximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured\nwith a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over tem-\nperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have an adequate\ndielectric to ensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary\ntemperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics\nwith a voltage rating of 6.3 V or 10 V are recommended. Y5V and\nZ5U dielectrics are not recommended due to their poor temperature\nand dc bias characteristics.\nFigure 29  depicts the capacitance vs. voltage bias characteristic\nof an 0402, 1 µF, 10 V X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a\ncapacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltagerating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage\nrating exhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R\ndielectric is ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and\nis not a function of package or voltage rating.\nFigure 29. Capacitance vs. Voltage Bias Characteristic\nUse Equation 1  to determine the worst case capacitance, account-\ning for capacitor variation over temperature, component tolerance,\nand voltage.\nC E F F = C BI AS × 1 − TEMPC O × 1 − TOL (1)\nwhere:\nCBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage.\nTEMPCO  is the worst-case capacitor temperature coefficient.\nTOL is the worst-case component tolerance.\nIn this example, the worst-case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO)\nover −40°C to +85°C is 15% for an X5R dielectric, the tolerance of\nthe capacitor (TOL) is 10%, and CBIAS is 0.94 µF at 1.8 V, as shown\nin Figure 29 .\nSubstituting these values in Equation 1  yields the following:\n     CEFF = 0.94 µF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 0.719 µF\nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the mini-\nmum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temperature and\ntolerance at the chosen output voltage.\nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP151 , it is imperative that\nthe effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the behavior\nof the capacitors be evaluated for each application.\nENABLE FEATURE\nThe ADP151  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT pin\nunder normal operating conditions. As shown in Figure 30 , when a\nrising voltage on EN crosses the active threshold, VOUT turns on.\nWhen a falling voltage on EN crosses the inactive threshold, VOUT\nturns off.\nData Sheet ADP151\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 13 of 23Figure 30. ADP151  Typical EN Pin Operation\nAs shown in Figure 30 , the EN pin has hysteresis built in to prevent\non and off oscillations that can occur due to noise on the EN pin as\nthis pin passes through the threshold points.\nThe EN pin active and inactive thresholds are derived from the\nVIN voltage. Therefore, these thresholds vary with changing input\nvoltage. Figure 31  shows typical EN active and inactive thresholds\nwhen the input voltage varies from 2.2 V to 5.5 V.\nFigure 31. Typical EN Pin Thresholds vs. Input Voltage\nThe ADP151  uses an internal soft start to limit the inrush current\nwhen the output is enabled. The start-up time for the 3.3 V option\nis approximately 160 µs from the time the EN active threshold is\ncrossed to when the output reaches 90% of its final value. As\nshown in Figure 32 , the start-up time is dependent on the output\nvoltage setting.Figure 32. Typical Start-Up Behavior\nADJUSTABLE OUTPUT VOLTAGE OPERATION\nThe unique architecture of the ADP151  makes an adjustable ver-\nsion difficult to implement in silicon. However, it is possible to create\nan adjustable regulator at the expense of increasing the quiescent\ncurrent of the regulator circuit.\nThe ADP151 , and similar LDOs, are designed to regulate the output\nvoltage (VOUT) appearing at the VOUT pin with respect to the GND\npin. If the GND pin is at a potential other than 0 V (for example,\nat the offset voltage (VOFFSET )), the ADP151  output voltage is VOUT\n+ VOFFSET . By taking advantage of this behavior, it is possible\nto create an adjustable ADP151  circuit that retains most of the\ndesirable characteristics of the ADP151 .\nFigure 33. Adjustable LDO Using the ADP151\nThe circuit shown in Figure 33  is an example of an adjustable LDO\nusing the ADP151 . A stable VOFFSET  voltage is created by passing\na known current through R2. The current through R2 is determined\nby the voltage across R1. Because the voltage across R1 is set by\nthe voltage between VOUT and GND, the current passing through\nR2 is fixed, and VOFFSET  is stable.\nTo minimize the effect variation of the ADP151  ground current\n(IGND) with load, it is best to keep R1 as small as possible. It is also\nbest to size the current passing through R2 to at least 20× greater\nthan the maximum expected ground current.\nTo create a 4 V LDO circuit, start with the 3.3 V version of the\nADP151  to minimize the value of R2. Because VOUT is 4 V, VOFFSET\nmust be 0.7 V, and the current through R2 must be 7 mA. R1 is,\ntherefore, 3.3 V/7 mA or 471 Ω. A 470 Ω standard value introduces\nData Sheet ADP151\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 14 of 23less than 1% error. Capacitor C3 is necessary to stabilize the LDO.\nA value of 1 µF is adequate.\nFigure 34  through Figure 38  show the typical performance of the\n4 V LDO circuit.\nThe noise performance of the 4 V LDO circuit is only about 1 µV\nworse than the same LDO used at 3.3 V because the output noise\nof the circuit is almost solely determined by the LDO and not the\nexternal components. The small difference may be attributed to the\ninternally generated noise in the LDO ground current working with\nR2. By keeping R2 small, this noise contribution can be minimized.\nThe PSRR of the 4 V circuit is as much as 10 dB poorer than the\n3.3 V LDO with 500 mV of headroom because the ground current of\nthe LDO varies slightly with input voltage. This, in turn, modulates\nVOFFSET  and reduces the PSRR of the regulator. By increasing the\nheadroom to 1 V, the PSRR performance is nearly restored to the\nperformance of the fixed output LDO.\nFigure 34. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical Load Regulation over Temperature\nFigure 35. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical Line Regulation over Load CurrentFigure 36. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical RMS Output Noise, 10 Hz to 100 kHz\nFigure 37. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical PSRR vs. Load Current, 1 V Headroom\nFigure 38. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical PSRR vs. Load Current, 500 mV\nHeadroom\nData Sheet ADP151\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 15 of 23CURRENT-LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD\nPROTECTION\nThe ADP151  is protected against damage due to excessive power\ndissipation by current and thermal overload protection circuits. The\nADP151  is designed to current limit when the output load reaches\n300 mA (typical). When the output load exceeds 300 mA, the output\nvoltage is reduced to maintain a constant current limit.\nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the junction\ntemperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme\nconditions (that is, high ambient temperature and power dissipation)\nwhen the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C, the\noutput is turned off, reducing the output current to 0. When the\njunction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on\nagain, and the output current is restored to its nominal value.\nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground\noccurs. At first, the ADP151  current limits, so that only 300 mA\nis conducted into the short. If self heating of the junction causes\nits temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal shutdown activates,\nturning off the output and reducing the output current to 0. As the\njunction temperature cools and drops below 135°C, the output turns\non and conducts 300 mA into the short, again causing the junction\ntemperature to rise above 150°C. This thermal oscillation between\n135°C and 150°C causes a current oscillation between 300 mA and\n0 mA that continues as long as the short remains at the output.\nCurrent-limit and thermal limit protections protect the device against\naccidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, device power\ndissipation must be externally limited so that junction temperatures\ndo not exceed 125°C.\nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn most applications, the ADP151  does not dissipate much heat due\nto its high efficiency. However, in applications with a high ambient\ntemperature and a high supply voltage to output voltage differential,\nthe heat dissipated in the package can cause the junction temper-\nature of the die to exceed the maximum junction temperature of\n125°C.\nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter\nenters thermal shutdown. The converter recovers only after the\njunction temperature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any\npermanent damage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen\napplication is important to guarantee reliable performance over all\nconditions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of the\nambient temperature of the environment and the temperature rise\nof the package due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation\n2.\nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the\nADP151  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction tem-\nperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be aware\nof the parameters that contribute to junction temperature changes.\nThese parameters include ambient temperature, power dissipationin the power device, and thermal resistances between the junction\nand ambient air ( θJA). The θJA number is dependent on the package\nassembly compounds that are used and the amount of copper used\nto solder the package GND pins to the PCB.\nTable 6  shows typical θJA values of the 5-lead TSOT, the 6-lead\nLFCSP, and the 4-ball WLCSP for various PCB copper sizes. Table\n7 shows the typical ΨJB values of the 5-lead TSOT, the 6-lead\nLFCSP, and the 4-ball WLCSP.\nTable 6.

Typical ΨJB Values\nModel ΨJB (°C/W)\n5-Lead TSOT 43\n4-Ball WLCSP 58\n6-Lead LFCSP 28.3\nTo calculate the junction temperature of the ADP151 , use the\nfollowing equation:\nT J = T A + P D × θ J A (2)\nwhere:\nTA is the ambient temperature.\nPD is the power dissipation in the die, given by\nP D = V I N − V O U T × I L O A D + V I N × I G ND (3)\nwhere:\nVIN and VOUT are input and output voltages, respectively.\nILOAD is the load current.\nIGND is the ground current.\nPower dissipation due to ground current is small and can be\nignored. Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to\nthe following:\nT J = T A + V I N − V OU T × I LO AD × θ J A (4)\nAs shown in Equation 4 , for a given ambient temperature, input to\noutput voltage differential, and continuous load current, there exists\na minimum copper size requirement for the PCB to ensure that the\njunction temperature does not rise above 125°C.\nFigure 39  through Figure 59  show junction temperature calculations\nfor various ambient temperatures, load currents, VIN to VOUT differ-\nentials, and areas of PCB copper.\nData Sheet ADP151\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev.
