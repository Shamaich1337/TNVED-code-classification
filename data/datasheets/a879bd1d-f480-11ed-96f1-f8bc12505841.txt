The ADCMP572  features \nCML output drivers and latch inputs, and the ADCMP573  \nfeatures reduced swing PECL (RSPECL) output drivers and \nlatch inputs.  \nBoth devices offer 150 ps propagation delay and 80 ps \nminimum pulse width for 10 Gbps operation with 200 fs rms random jitter (RJ). Overdrive and slew rate dispersion are typically less than 15 ps.  \nA flexible power supply scheme allows both devices to operate \nwith a single 3.3 V positive supply and a −0.2 V to +1.2 V input signal range or with split input/output supplies to support a wider −0.2 V to +3.2 V input signal range and an independent \nrange of output levels. 50 Ω on-chip termination resistors are  provided at both inputs with the optional capability to be left \nopen (on an individual pin basis) for applications requiring \nhigh impedance inputs. \nThe CML output stage is designed to directly drive 400 mV into \n50 Ω transmission lines terminated to between 3.3 V to 5.2 V . The RSPECL output stage is designed to drive 400 mV into 50 Ω terminated to V\nCCO − 2 V and is compatible with several commonly \nused PECL logic families. The comparator input stage offers robust protection against large input overdrive, and the outputs do not \nphase reverse when the valid input signal range is exceeded. \nHigh speed latch and programmable hysteresis features are also \nprovided. \nThe ADCMP572  and ADCMP573  are available in a 16-lead \nLFCSP package and have been characterized over an extended \nindustrial temperature range of −40°C to +125°C. \n \nADCMP572/ADCMP573 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

B | Page 9 of 14 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nPOWER/GROUND LAYOUT AND BYPASSING \nThe ADCMP572 /ADCMP573  comparators are very high speed \nSiGe devices. Consequently, it is essential to use proper high speed \ndesign techniques to achieve the specified performance. Of critical importance is the use of low impedance supply planes, particularly \nthe output supply plane (V\nCCO) and the ground plane (GND). \nIndividual supply planes are recommended as part of a multilayer \nboard. Providing the lowest inductance return path for switching currents ensures the best possible performance in the target \napplication.  \nIt is important to adequately bypass the input and output supplies. \nA 1 μF electrolytic bypass capacitor should be placed within several inches of each power supply pin to ground. In addition, \nmultiple high quality 0.01 μF bypass capacitors should be placed \nas close as possible to each of the V\nCCI and V CCO supply pins and \nshould be connected to the GND plane with redundant vias. High frequency bypass capacitors should be carefully selected for minimum inductance and ESR. Parasitic layout inductance should \nbe avoided to maximize the effectiveness of the bypass at high \nfrequencies.  \nIf the input and output supplies are connected separately such \nthat V\nCCI ≠ V CCO, care should be taken to bypass each of these \nsupplies separately to the GND plane. A bypass capacitor should not be connected between them. It is recommended that the GND plane separate the V\nCCI and V CCO planes when the circuit \nboard layout is designed to minimize coupling between the two supplies and to take advantage of the additional bypass capaci-tance from each respective supply to the ground plane. This enhances the performance when split input/output supplies are used. If the input and output supplies are connected together for \nsingle-supply operation such that V\nCCI = V CCO, coupling between \nthe two supplies is unavoidable; however, every effort should be \nmade to keep the supply plane adjacent to the GND plane to maximize the additional bypass capacitance this arrangement \nprovides. \nCML/RSPECL OUTPUT STAGE \nSpecified propagation delay dispersion performance can be \nachieved only by using proper transmission line terminations. The outputs of the ADCMP572  are designed to directly drive \n400 mV into 50 Ω cable, microstrip, or strip line transmission \nlines properly terminated to the V\nCCO supply plane. The CML \noutput stage is shown in the simplified schematic diagram of Figure 15. The outputs are each back terminated with 50 Ω for best transmission line matching. The RSPECL outputs of the \nADCMP573  are illustrated in Figure 16 and should be terminated \nto V\nCCO − 2 V . As an alternative, Thevenin equivalent termination \nnetworks can be used in either case if the direct termination \nvoltage is not readily available. If high speed output signals must be routed more than a centimeter, microstrip or strip line \ntechniques are essential to ensure proper transition times and to prevent output ringing and pulse width dependent propagation \ndelay dispersion. For the most timing critical applications where transmission line reflections pose the greatest risk to performance, the ADCMP572  provides the best match to 50 Ω output \ntransmission paths. \nQ\n16mA50\uf057\nQ\n04409-037VCCO\nGND \nFigure 15.

Simplified Schematic Diagram of  \nthe ADCMP573  RSPECL Output Stage  \nUSING/DISABLING THE LATCH FEATURE \nThe latch inputs (LE/ LE) are active low for latch mode and are \ninternally terminated with 50 Ω resistors to Pin 8. This pin \ncorresponds to and is internally connected to the V CCO supply \nfor the CML-compatible ADCMP572 . With the aid of these \nresistors, the ADCMP572  latch function can be disabled by \nconnecting the LE pin to GND with an external pull-down \nresistor and leaving the LE pin unconnected. To avoid excessive \npower dissipation, the resistor should be 750 Ω when V CCO = \n3.3 V , and 1.2 kΩ when V CCO = 5.2 V . In the PECL-compatible \nADCMP573 , the V TT pin should be connected externally to the \nPECL termination supply at V CCO – 2 V . The latch can then be \ndisabled by connecting the LE pin to V CCO with an external \n500 Ω resistor and leaving the LE pin disconnected. In this case, \nthe resistor value does not depend on the V CCO supply voltage.  \nADCMP572/ADCMP573 Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 10 of 14 VCCO is the signal return for the output stage and V CCO pins \nshould of course be connected to a supply plane for maximum \nperformance. \nOPTIMIZING HIGH SPEED PERFORMANCE \nAs with any high speed comparator, proper design and layout \ntechniques are essential to obtaining the specified performance. \nStray capacitance, inductance, inductive power and ground \nimpedances, or other layout issues can severely limit performance \nand often cause oscillation. Discontinuities along input and output transmission lines can severely limit the specified pulse \nwidth dispersion performance. \nFor applications working in a 50 Ω environment, input and \noutput matching has a significant impact on data dependent (or deterministic) jitter (DJ) and on pulse width dispersion \nperformance. The ADCMP572 /ADCMP573  comparators \nprovide internal 50 Ω termination resistors for both the V\nP and \nVN inputs, and the ADCMP572  provides 50 Ω back terminated \noutputs. The return side for each input termination is pinned \nout separately with the V TP and V TN pins, respectively. If a 50 Ω \ntermination is desired at one or both of the V P/V N inputs, then \nthe V TP and V TN pins can be connected (or disconnected) to \n(from) the desired termination potential as required. The termination potential should be carefully bypassed using high quality bypass capacitors as discussed earlier to prevent undesired aberrations on the input signal due to parasitic inductance in \nthe circuit board layout. If a 50 Ω input termination is not \ndesired, either one or both of the V\nTP/V TN termination pins can \nbe left disconnected. In this case, the pins should be left floating \nwith no external pull-downs or bypassing capacitors. \nWhen leaving an input termination disconnected, the internal \nresistor acts as a small stub on the input transmission path and can cause problems for very high speed inputs. Reflections \nshould then be expected from the comparator inputs because \nthey no longer provide matched impedance to the input path leading to the device. In this case, it is important to back match the drive source impedance to the input transmission path to minimize multiple reflections. For applications in which the \ncomparator is very close to the driving signal source, the source \nimpedance should be minimized. High source impedance in combination with parasitic input capacitance of the comparator might cause an undesirable degradation in bandwidth at the input, therefore degrading the overall response. Although the \nADCMP572 /ADCMP573  comparators have been designed to \nminimize input capacitance, some parasitic capacitance is \ninevitable. It is therefore recommended that the drive source \nimpedance be no more than 50 Ω for best high speed performance.  \n  COMPARATOR PROPAGATION \nDELAY DISPERSION \nThe ADCMP572 /ADCMP573  comparators are designed to \nreduce propagation delay dispersion over a wide input overdrive \nrange of 5 mV to 500 mV . Propagation delay dispersion is variation \nin the propagation delay that results from a change in the degree of \noverdrive or slew rate (how far or how fast the input signal \nexceeds the switching threshold).  \nPropagation delay dispersion is a specification that becomes \nimportant in high speed, time-critical applications such as data communication, automatic test and measurement, instrumenta-tion, and event driven applications such as pulse spectroscopy, \nnuclear instrumentation, and medical imaging. Dispersion is \ndefined as the variation in propagation delay as the input over-drive conditions vary (Figure 17 and Figure 18). For the ADCMP572 /ADCMP573 , dispersion is typically <15 ps \nbecause the overdrive varies from 10 mV to 500 mV , and the \ninput slew rate varies from 2 V/ns to 10 V/ns. This specification \napplies for both positive and negative signals since the ADCMP572 /ADCMP573  has substantially equal delays for \neither positive going or negative going inputs.  \nQ/Q OUTPUTINPUT VOLTAGE500mV OVERDRIVE\n10mV OVERDRIVE\nDISPERSIONVN± VOS\n04409-0-027 \nFigure 17.

B | Page 11 of 14 COMPARATOR HYSTERESIS \nThe addition of hysteresis to a comparator is often desirable in a \nnoisy environment or when the differential input amplitudes are \nrelatively small or slow moving, but excessive hysteresis has a cost in degraded accuracy and slew-induced timing shifts. The \ntransfer function for a comparator with hysteresis is shown in \nFigure 19. If the input voltage approaches the threshold (0.0 V in this example) from the negative direction, the comparator switches from low to high when the input crosses + V\nH/2. The \nnew switching threshold becomes −V H/2. The comparator \nremains in the high state until the threshold −V H/2 is crossed \nfrom the positive direction. In this manner, noise centered on 0.0 V input does not cause the comparator to switch states \nunless it exceeds the region bounded by ±V\nH/2. \nOUTPUT\nINPUT 0VOLVOH\n+VH\n2–VH\n2\n04409-005 \nFigure 19. Comparator Hysteresis Transfer Function \nThe customary technique for introducing hysteresis into a \ncomparator uses positive feedback from the output back to the input. A limitation of this approach is that the amount of hysteresis varies with the output logic levels, resulting in hysteresis that can be load dependent and is not symmetrical \nabout the threshold. The external feedback network can also \nintroduce significant parasitics, which reduce high speed \nperformance and can even induce oscillation in some cases.  \nThe ADCMP572 /ADCMP573  comparators offer a program-\nmable hysteresis feature that can significantly improve the \naccuracy and stability of the desired hysteresis. By connecting an external pull-down resistor from the HYS pin to GND, a \nvariable amount of hysteresis can be applied. Leaving the HYS \npin disconnected disables the feature, and hysteresis is then less than 1 mV as specified. The maximum hysteresis that can be applied using this method is approximately ±25 mV with the pin grounded. Figure 20 illustrates the amount of hysteresis applied as a function of external resistor value. The advantages of applying hysteresis in this manner are improved accuracy, stability, and reduced component count. An external bypass capacitor is \nnot recommended on the HYS pin because it would likely degrade \nthe jitter performance of the device. The hysteresis pin could also be driven by a CMOS DAC. It is biased to approximately 250 mV and has an internal series resistance of 600 Ω.  \n0102030405060HYSTERESIS (mV)\n23 01 456\nRHYS (k\uf057)\n04409-043 \nFigure 20. Hysteresis vs. R HYS Control Resistor \nMINIMUM INPUT SLEW RATE REQUIREMENTS \nAs with all high speed comparators, a minimum slew rate \nrequirement must be met to ensure that the device does not \noscillate as the input signal crosses the threshold. This oscillation is \ndue in part to the high input bandwidth of the comparator and \nthe feedback parasitics inherent in the package. A minimum slew rate of 50 V/μs should ensure clean output transitions from \nthe ADCMP572 /ADCMP573  comparators. \nThe slew rate may be too slow for other reasons. The extremely \nhigh bandwidth of these devices means that broadband noise can be a significant factor when input slew rates are low. There \nwill be at least 120 μV of thermal noise generated over the full \ncomparator bandwidth by two 50 Ω terminations at room temperature. With a slew rate of only 50 V/μs the input will be inside this noise band for over 2 ps, rendering the comparator’s jitter performance of 200 fs moot. Raising the slew rate of the \ninput signal and/or reducing the bandwidth over which this \nresistance is seen at the input can greatly reduce jitter.  \n \nADCMP572/ADCMP573 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
