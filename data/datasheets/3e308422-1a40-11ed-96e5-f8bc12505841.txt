The LT3650 \nprovides  a constant -current /constant- voltage  charge  \ncharacteristic, with maximum charge current externally \nprogrammable up to 2A, set using an external current \nsense resistor. A precondition feature trickle-charges a \nlow voltage battery, and bad-battery detection provides a \nsignal  and suspends  charging if a battery  does not respond  \nto preconditioning. \nThe LT3650 can be configured to terminate charging when \ncharge current falls to C/10, or one-tenth the programmed \nmaximum current. Once charging is terminated, the LT3650  \nenters a low current (85µA) standby mode. An auto-restart \nfeature starts a new charging cycle if the battery voltage \ndrops 2.5% from the float voltage, or if a new battery is \ninserted into a charging system.The LT3650 contains a user- programmable internal safety  \ntimer ( typically set to a three hour full cycle time). The IC \ncan be configured to use this internal timer if a time- based  \ntermination scheme is desired in which charging can con-\ntinue below C /10 until a desired time is reached.\nThe LT3650  is available in a low profile (0.75mm) 3mm × \n3mm 12-pin DFN and 12-pin MSOP packages.FeaTures\napplica TionsDescrip TionHigh Voltage 2 Amp \nMonolithic 2-Cell \nLi-Ion Battery Charger\n11.5V to 32V 2-Cell 2A Chargern Wide Input Voltage Range: 9V to 32V (40V Absolute \nMaximum)\nn Programmable Charge Current: Up to 2A\nn User-Selectable Termination: C/10 or Onboard T\nermination Timer\nn Dynamic Charge Rate Programming/Soft-Start Pin\nn Programmable Input Current Limit\nn 1MHz Fixed Frequency\nn Average Current Mode Control\nn 0.5% Float Voltage Accuracy\nn 5% Charge Current Accuracy\nn 2.5% C/10 Detection Accuracy\nn NTC Resistor Temperature Monitor\nn Auto-Recharge at 97.5% Float Voltage\nn Auto-Precondition at <70% Float Voltage\nn Bad-Battery Detection with Auto-Reset\nn Binary Coded Open-Collector Status Pins\nn 3mm × 3mm DFN-12 or MSOP-12 Package\nn Industrial Handheld Instruments\nn 12V to 24V Automotive and Heavy Equipment\nn Desktop Cradle Chargers\nn Notebook Computers\n365082 TA01aSW VINVIN\n11.5V TO 32V\nCLP\nRNG/SSBOOST\nSENSE\nBAT\nNTC\nTIMERCMPSH1-4CMSH3-40MA CMSH3-40MA\n1µF10µF\n10µH\n0.05/uni03A9\n10µF\n0.68µFL T3650-8.2\nBATTERYSHDN\nCHRG\nFAULT +Charge Current, Efficiency and Power Loss vs Time\nTIME (MINUTES)0CHARGE CURRENT (A), POWER LOSS (W)EFFICIENCY (%)\n1.02.03.0\n0.51.52.5\n35557595\n456585\n40 80 120 160\n365082 TA01b200 20 0 60 100 140 180VIN = 20V\nPOWER\nLOSSEFFICIENCY\nCHARGE\nCURRENTL, LT , LT C , LT M , Linear Technology, PowerPath and the Linear logo are registered trademarks \nof Linear Technology Corporation.

V IN pin operating range \nis 9V to 32V. V IN ≥ 11.5V or (V BOOST  – VSW) > 2V is re-\nquired for start-up. I VIN = 85µA after charge termination.\nCLP (Pin 2): System Current Limit Input. System current \nlevels can be monitored by connecting the input power \nsupply to the CLP pin and connecting a sense resistor \nfrom the CLP pin to the V IN pin. Additional system load is \ndrawn from the V IN pin connection, and maximum system \nload is achieved when V CLP – V VIN = 50mV. The LT3650 \nservos the maximum charge current required to maintain \nprogrammed maximum system current. If this function is \nnot desired, connect the CLP pin to the V IN pin (see the \nApplications Information section).\nSHDN (Pin 3): Precision Threshold Shutdown Pin. The \nenable threshold is 1.225V (rising), with 120mV of input \nhysteresis. When in shutdown mode, all charging functions  \nare disabled. The precision threshold allows use of the \nSHDN pin to incorporate UVLO functions. If the SHDN pin \nis pulled below 0.4V, the IC enters a low current shutdown \nmode where the V IN pin current is reduced to 15µA. Typi-\ncal SHDN pin input bias current is 10 nA. If  the shutdown \nfunction is not desired, connect the pin to the V IN pin.\nCHRG (Pin 4): Open-Collector Charger Status Output; \ntypically pulled up through a resistor to a reference volt-\nage. This status pin can be pulled up to voltages as high \nas V IN when disabled, and can sink currents up to 10mA \nwhen enabled. During a battery charging cycle,  CHRG is \npulled low. When the charge cycle is terminated, the CHRG \npin becomes high impedance. If the internal timer is used \nfor termination, the pin stays low during the charging \ncycle until the charge current drops below a C/10 rate, or \nICHG(MAX) /10. A temperature fault also causes this pin to \nbe pulled low (see the Applications Information section).\nFAUL T (Pin 5): Open-Collector Fault Status Output; typi-\ncally pulled up through a resistor to a reference voltage. \nThis status pin can be pulled up to voltages as high as V IN \nwhen disabled, and can sink currents up to 10mA when \nenabled. This pin indicates charge cycle fault conditions \nduring a battery charging cycle. A temperature fault causes  \nthis pin to be pulled low. If the internal timer is used for \ntermination, a bad-battery  fault  also causes this pin to be \npulled low. If no fault conditions exist, the FAUL T pin \nremains high impedance (see the Applications Informa-\ntion section).\nTIMER (Pin 6): End-Of-Cycle Timer Programming Pin. \nIf a timer-based charge termination is desired, connect \na capacitor from this pin to ground. Full charge end-of-\ncycle time (in hours) is programmed with this capacitor \nfollowing the equation:\n tEOC = C TIMER  • 4.4 • 106\nA bad-battery fault is generated if the battery does not \nreach the precondition threshold  voltage within one-eighth  \nof tEOC, or:\n tPRE = C TIMER  • 5.5 • 105\nA 0.68µF capacitor is typically used, which generates a \ntimer EOC at three hours, and a precondition limit time of \n22.5 minutes. If a timer-based termination is not desired, \nthe timer function is disabled by connecting the TIMER \npin to ground. With the timer function disabled, charging \nterminates when the charge current drops below a C/10 \nrate, or I CHG(MAX) /10.\nRNG/SS (Pin 7): Charge Current Programming Pin. This \npin allows a dynamic adjustment of the maximum charge \ncurrent, and can be used to employ a soft-start function. \nMaximum charge current is adjusted by setting the volt-\nage on this pin , such  that the maximum desired voltage \nacross the\n inductor current sense resistor ( VSENSE  – VBAT) is  \n0.1 • V RNG/ SS, so the maximum charge current reduces to:\n VRNG/SS  • ICHG(MAX)\nThis pin has an effective range from 0V to 1V. 50µA is \nsourced from this pin, so the maximum charge current \ncan be programmed by connecting a resistor (R RNG/SS ) \nfrom RNG/SS to ground, such that the voltage dropped \nacross the resistor is equivalent to the desired program-\nming voltage, or:\n VRNG/SS  = 50µA • R RNG/SS\nSoft-start functionality can be implemented by connect-ing a capacitor (C\nRNG/SS ) from RNG/SS to ground, such \nthat the time required to charge the capacitor to 1V (full \nLT3650-8.2/LT3650-8.4\n7\n36508284fdcharge current) is the desired soft-start interval (t SS). \nFor no R RNG/SS , this capacitor value follows the relation:\n CRNG/SS  = 50µA • t SS\nThe RNG/SS pin is pulled low during fault conditions, \nallowing graceful recovery from faults should soft-start \nfunctionality be implemented. Both the soft-start capaci-\ntor and the programming resistor can be implemented in \nparallel. All C/10 monitoring functions are disabled while \nVRNG/SS  is below 0.1V to accommodate long soft-start \nintervals.\nRNG/SS voltage can also be manipulated using an active \ndevice, employing a pull-down transistor to disable charge \ncurrent or to dynamically servo maximum charge current. \nManipulation of the RNG/SS pin with active devices that \nhave low impedance pull-up capability is not allowed (see \nthe Applications Information section).\nNTC (Pin 8): Battery Temperature Monitor Pin. This pin is \nthe input to the NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) \nthermistor temperature monitoring circuit. This function is \nenabled by connecting a 10kΩ, B = 3380 NTC thermistor \nfrom the NTC pin to ground. The pin sources 50µA, and \nmonitors the voltage across the 10kΩ thermistor. When \nthe voltage on this pin is above 1.36V (T < 0°C) or below \n0.29V (T > 40°C), charging is  disabled and the CHRG  and \nFAUL T pins are both pulled low. If internal timer termina-\ntion is being used, the timer is paused, suspending the \ncharging cycle. Charging resumes when the voltage on \nNTC returns to within the 0.29V to 1.36V active region. \nThere is approximately 5°C of temperature hysteresis associated with each of the temperature thresholds. The \ntemperature monitoring function remains enabled while thermistor resistance to ground is less than 250kΩ, so if \nthis function is not desired, leave the NTC pin unconnected.\nBAT (Pin 9): Battery Voltage Monitor Pin. Connect 10µF \ndecoupling capacitance (C\nBAT) from this pin to ground.  \nDepending on application requirements, larger value de-\ncoupling capacitors may be required (see the Application \nInformation section). The charge function operates to \nachieve the final float voltage at this pin. The auto-restart \nfeature initiates a new charging cycle when the voltage at the BAT pin falls 2.5% below this float voltage. Once the \ncharge cycle is terminated, the input bias current of the BAT \npin is reduced to <0.1µA, to minimize battery discharge \nwhile the charger remains connected.\nSENSE (Pin 10): Charge Current Sense Pin. Connect the \nmore positive voltage end of the inductor sense resistor \n(RSENSE ) to the SENSE pin and the other end to the B AT \npin. The voltage across this resistor sets the average \ncharge current. The maximum average charge current \n(IMAX) corresponds to 100mV across the sense resistor. \nThis resistor can be set to program maximum charge \ncurrents as high as 2A. The sense resistor value follows \nthe relation:\n  RSENSE=0.1V\nIMAX\nOnce the charge cycle is terminated, the input bias cur-\nrent of the SENSE pin is reduced to <0.1µA, to minimize \nbattery discharge while the charger remains connected.\nBOOST (Pin 11): Bootstrapped Supply Rail for Switch \nDrive. This pin facilitates saturation of the switch transistor. \nConnect a 1µF or greater capacitor from the BOOST pin to the SW pin. Operating range of this pin is 0V to 8.5V, \nreferenced to the SW pin. The voltage on the decoupling capacitor is refreshed through a rectifying diode, with the anode connected to either the battery output voltage \nor an external source, and the cathode connected to the \nBOOST pin.\nSW (Pin 12): Switch Output Pin. This pin is the output \nof the charger switch, and corresponds to the emitter of \nthe switch transistor. When enabled, the switch shorts \nthe SW pin to the V\nIN supply.

A wide input range allows the operation to full-\ncharge from 9V to 32V. A precision threshold shutdown \npin allows incorporation of UVLO functionality using a \nsimple resistor divider. The IC can also be put into a low current shutdown mode, in which the input supply bias \nis reduced to only 15µA.\nThe LT3650 incorporates several degrees of charge current  \ncontrol freedom. The overall maximum charge current is \nset using an external inductor current sense resistor. A \nmaximum charge current programming pin allows dynamic  \nmanipulation of the battery charge current. The LT3650 \nalso incorporates a system input supply current limit \ncontrol feature that servos the battery charge current to \naccommodate overall system load requirements.\nThe LT3650 automatically enters a battery precondition \nmode if the sensed battery voltage is very low. In this  \nmode, the charge current is reduced to  15% of the  \nprogrammed \nmaximum, as set by the inductor sense \nresistor, RSENSE . Once the battery voltage climbs   \nabove the internally set precondition threshold, the IC \nautomatically increases the maximum charge current to \nthe full programmed value.\nThe LT3650 can use a charge current based C/10 termina-\ntion scheme, which ends a charge cycle when the battery \ncharge current falls to one-tenth the programmed maxi-\nmum charge current. The LT3650 also contains an internal \ncharge cycle control timer, for timer-based termination.  \nWhen using the internal timer, the IC combines C/10 \ndetection with a programmable time constraint, during \nwhich the charging cycle can continue beyond the C/10 \nlevel to “top-off” a battery. The charge cycle terminates \nwhen a specific time elapses, typically three hours. When the timer-based scheme is used, the IC also supports bad-\nbattery detection, which triggers a system fault if a battery \nstays in precondition mode for more than one-eighth of \nthe total programmed charge cycle time.\nOnce  charging  is terminated  and the LT3650  is not  \nactively charging, the IC automatically enters a low current \nstandby mode in which supply bias currents are reduced \nto 85µA. If the battery voltage drops  2.5% from the full \ncharge float voltage, the LT3650 engages an automatic \ncharge cycle restart. The IC also automatically restarts a new charge cycle after a bad-battery fault once the failed \nbattery is removed and replaced with another battery.\nThe LT3650 contains provisions for a battery temperature \nmonitoring circuit. This feature monitors battery tem-\nperature by using a thermistor during the charging cycle, \nsuspends charging, and signals a fault condition if the \nbattery temperature moves outside a safe charging range.\nThe LT3650 contains two digital open-collector outputs, \nwhich provide charger status and signal fault conditions.  \nThese binary coded pins signal battery charging, standby \nor shutdown modes, battery temperature faults and bad-\nbattery faults.\nGeneral Operation (See Block Diagram)\nThe LT3650 uses average current mode control architec-\nture, such that the IC servos directly to average charge \ncurrent. The LT3650 senses charger output voltage via the \nBAT pin. The difference between the voltage on this pin \nand an internal float voltage reference is integrated by the \nvoltage error amplifier (V-EA). This amplifier generates an \nerror voltage on its output (I\nTH), which corresponds to the \naverage current sensed across the inductor current sense \nresistor, R SENSE , which is connected between the SENSE \nand B\nAT pins. The I TH voltage is then divided down by a \nfactor of 10, and imposed on the input of the current er-\nror amplifier (C-EA). The difference between this imposed \nvoltage and the current sense resistor voltage is integrated, \nwith the resulting voltage (V C) used as a threshold that \nis compared against an internally generated ramp. The \noutput of this comparison controls the charger’s switch.\nLT3650-8.2/LT3650-8.4\n10\n36508284fdopera Tion\nThe I TH error voltage corresponds linearly to average cur-\nrent sensed across the inductor current sense resistor, \nallowing maximum charge current control by limiting the \neffective voltage range of I TH. A clamp limits this voltage \nto 1V which, in turn, limits the current sense voltage to \n100mV. This sets the maximum charge current, or the \ncurrent  delivered  while  the charger  is operating  in constant -\ncurrent (CC) mode, which corresponds to 100mV across \nRSENSE . This maximum charge current level can also be \nmanipulated through the RNG/SS pin (see the RNG/SS: \nDynamic Charge Current Adjust and RNG/SS: Soft-Start \nsections).\nIf the voltage  on the BAT pin is below  VBAT(PRE), the LT3650  \nengages precondition mode. During the precondition inter-\nval, the charger continues to operate in constant-current \nmode, but the maximum charge current is reduced to 15% \nof the maximum programmed value as set by R SENSE .\nWhen the charger output voltage on the BAT pin approaches  \nthe float voltage (V BAT(F LT)), the charger transitions into \nconstant- voltage ( CV) mode, and charge current is reduced  \nfrom the maximum value. As this occurs, the I TH voltage \nfalls from the limit clamp and servos to lower  voltages. \nThe \nIC monitors the I TH voltage as it is reduced, and \ndetection of the C/10 charge current is achieved when \nITH = 0.1V. If the charger is configured for C/10 termina-\ntion, this threshold is used to terminate the charge cycle.  \nOnce the charge cycle is terminated, the CHRG status \npin becomes high impedance and the charger enters low \ncurrent standby mode.\nThe LT3650 contains an internal charge cycle timer that \nterminates a successful charge cycle after a programmed \namount of time. This timer is typically programmed to \nachieve end-of-cycle (EOC) in three hours, but can be \nconfigured for any amount of time by setting an appropriate  timing capacitor value (C TIMER ). When timer termination \nis used, the charge cycle does not terminate after C/10 \nis achieved. Because the CHRG status pin responds to \nthe C/10 current level, the IC will indicate a fully charged \nbattery status, but the charger will continue to source \nlow currents into the battery until the programmed EOC \ntime has elapsed, at which time the charge cycle will \nterminate. At EOC, when the charging cycle terminates, if \nthe battery did not achieve at least 97.5% of the full float \nvoltage, charging is  deemed unsuccessful. The LT3650 \nwill \nthen re-initiate, and charging will continue for another \nfull timer cycle.\nUse of the timer function also enables bad-battery detec-\ntion. This fault condition is achieved if the battery does \nnot respond to preconditioning and the charger remains in (or enters) precondition mode after one-eighth of the \nprogrammed charge cycle time. A bad-battery fault halts \nthe charging cycle, the CHRG status pin goes high imped-\nance, and the FAUL T pin is pulled low.\nWhen the LT3650 terminates a charging cycle, whether \nthrough C/10 detection or by reaching timer EOC, the \naverage current mode analog loop remains active but the internal float voltage reference is reduced by 2.5%.  \nBecause the voltage on a successfully charged battery is \nat the full float voltage, the voltage error amp detects an overvoltage condition and rails low. When the voltage er-\nror amp output drops below 0.3V, the IC enters standby \nmode, where most of the internal circuitry is disabled, and \nthe V\nIN bias current is reduced to 85µA. When the voltage \non the BAT pin drops below the reduced float reference \nlevel, the output of the voltage error amp will climb, at \nwhich point the IC comes out of standby mode and a new \ncharging cycle is initiated.\nLT3650-8.2/LT3650-8.4\n11\n36508284fdVIN Input Supply\nThe LT3650 is biased directly from the charger input supply  \nthrough the V IN pin. This supply provides large switched \ncurrents, so a high quality, low ESR decoupling capacitor \nis recommended to minimize voltage glitches on V IN. The \nVIN decoupling capacitor ( CVIN) absorbs all input switching  \nripple current in the charger, so it must have an adequate \nripple current rating. RMS ripple current (I CVIN(RMS) ) is:\n \uf020 ICVIN(RMS) \uf03aICHG(MAX) •VBAT\nVIN\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7•VIN\nVBAT\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa−1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f71\n2\nwhich has a maximum at V IN  = 2 • V BAT, where:\n ICVIN(RMS)  = ICHG(MAX) /2\nThe simple worst-case of 1/2 • ICHG(MAX)  is commonly \nused for design.\nBulk capacitance is a function of desired input ripple volt-\nage (∆V IN), and follows the relation:\n  CIN(BULK)=IMAX•VBAT/ VIN\n∆VIN\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7µF( )\n10µF is typically adequate for most charger applications.\nBOOST Supply\nThe BOOST bootstrapped supply rail drives the internal \nswitch and facilitates saturation of switch transistor. Oper-\nating range of the BOOST pin is 0V to 8.5V, as referenced \nto the SW pin. Connect a 1µF or greater capacitor from \nthe BOOST pin to the SW pin.The voltage on the decoupling capacitor is refreshed \nthrough a diode, with the anode connected to/from either \nthe battery output voltage or an external source, and the \ncathode connected to the BOOST pin. Rate the diode av-\nerage current greater than 0.1A, and its reverse voltages \ngreater than V\nIN(MAX) .VIN/ BOOST Start-Up Requirement\nThe LT3650 operates with a V IN range of 9V to 32V, \nhowever, a start-up voltage requirement exists due to \nthe nature of the nonsynchronous step-down switcher \ntopology used for the charger. If there is no BOOST supply available, the internal switch requires (V\nIN – VSW) > 3V \nto operate. This requirement does not exist if the BOOST \nsupply is available and (V BOOST  – V SW) > 2V.\nWhen an LT3650 charger is not switching, the SW pin is at \nthe same potential as  the battery, which can be as high as \nVBAT(F LT). For reliable start-up, the V IN supply must be at \nleast 3V above the SW pin. The minimum start-up speci-\nfication of V IN at or above 11.5V provides ample margin \nto satisfy this requirement. Once switching begins, the BOOST supply capacitor gets charged such that (V\nBOOST  \n– VSW) > 2V, and the V IN requirement no longer applies.\nIn low V IN applications, the BOOST supply can be powered \nby an external source for start-up, eliminating the V IN \nstart-up requirement.\nVBAT Output Decoupling\nAn LT3650 charger output requires bypass capacitance \nconnected from the BAT pin to ground (C BAT). A 10µF ce-\nramic capacitor is required for all applications. In systems \nwhere the battery can be disconnected from the charger \noutput, additional bypass capacitance may be desired for \nvisual indication of a no-battery condition (see the Status \nPins section).\nIf it is desired to operate a system load from the LT3650 \ncharger output when the battery is disconnected, additional  \nbypass capacitance is required. In this type of application \nwith the charger being used as a DC/DC converter, exces-\nsive ripple and/or  low amplitude oscillations can occur \nwithout \nadditional output bulk capacitance. For these ap-\nplications, place a 100µF low ESR nonceramic capacitor \n(chip tantalum or organic semiconductor capacitors such \nas Sanyo OS-CONs or POSCAPs) from BAT to ground, \nin parallel with the 10µF ceramic bypass capacitor. This \nadditional bypass capacitance may also be required in \nsystems where the battery is connected to the charger \nthrough long wires. The voltage rating on C BAT must meet \nor exceed the battery float voltage.applica Tions inForMaTion\nLT3650-8.2/LT3650-8.4\n12\n36508284fdRSENSE : Charge Current Programming\nThe LT3650 charger is configurable to charge at average \ncurrents as high as 2A. Maximum charge current is set by \nchoosing an inductor sense resistor such that the desired \nmaximum average current through that sense resistor \ncreates a 100mV drop, or:\n  RSENSE=0.1\nIMAX(AVG)\nwhere I MAX(AVG ) is the maximum average charge current.  \nA 2A charger, for example, would use a 0.05Ω sense  \nresistor.to 35% of I MAX, so an inductor value can be determined \nby setting 0.25 < ∆I MAX < 0.35.\nMagnetics vendors typically specify inductors with \nmaximum RMS and saturation current ratings. Select an \ninductor that has a saturation current rating at or above  \n(1+∆I MAX/2) • IMAX, and an RMS rating above I MAX. In-\nductors must also meet a maximum volt-second product \nrequirement.

The rectifier is selected based upon \nforward voltage, reverse voltage, and maximum current. \nA Schottky diode is required, as low forward voltage yields \nthe lowest power loss and highest efficiency. The rectifier \ndiode must be rated to withstand reverse voltages greater \nthan the maximum V IN voltage.\nThe minimum average diode current rating ( IDIODE( MAX)) is \ncalculated  with maximum  output  current  (IMAX), maximum  \noperational V IN, and output at the precondition threshold \n(VBAT(PRE)):\n  IDIODE(MAX) >IMAX•(VIN(MAX)−VBAT(PRE) )\nVIN(MAX)(A)\nFor example, a rectifier diode for an 8.2V, 1.5A charger \nwith a 20V maximum input voltage would require:\n  IDIODE(MAX) >1.5•(20−5.65)\n20,or\nIDIODE(MAX) >1.1ACLP: System Current Limit\nThe LT3650 contains a PowerPathTM control feature to \nsupport multiple load systems. The charger adjusts out-\nput current in response to a system load if overall input \nsupply current exceeds the programmed maximum value. Maximum input supply current is set by choosing a sense \nresistor (R\nCLP) such that the desired maximum current \nthrough that sense resistor creates a 50mV drop, or: \n  RCLP=0.05\nIMAX(IN)\nwhere I MAX(IN)  is the maximum input current.

The \nvoltage on the RNG/SS pin corresponds to ten times the \nmaximum voltage across the sense resistor (R SENSE ). The \ndefault maximum sense voltage is 100mV, so maximum \ncharge current can be expressed as:\n IMAX(RNG/SS)  = IMAX • VRNG/SS\nwhere I MAX(RNG/SS)  is the maximum charge current if \nVRNG/SS  is within 0V to 1V. Voltages higher than 1V have \nno effect on the maximum charge current.\nThe LT3650 sources 50µA from the RNG/SS pin, such that \na current control voltage can be set by simply connecting \nan appropriately valued resistor to ground, following the \nrelation:\n  RRNG/SS=VRNG/SS\n50µA\nFor example, to reduce the maximum charge current to 50% \nof the original value, which corresponds to a maximum \nsense voltage of 50mV, RNG/SS would be set to 0.5V.\n  RRNG/SS=0.5V\n50µA=10kΩThis feature could be used, for example, to switch in a \nreduced charge current level. Active servos can also be \nused to impose voltages on the RNG/SS pin, provided they \ncan only sink current. Active circuits that source current \ncannot be used to drive the RNG/SS pin. Resistive pull-ups can be used, but extreme care must be taken not to \nexceed the 2.5V absolute maximum voltage on the pin.\nRNG/SS: Soft-Start \nSoft-start functionality is also supported by the RNG/SS \npin. 50µA is sourced from the RNG/SS pin, so connecting \na capacitor from the RNG/SS pin to ground (C\nRNG/SS ) cre-\nates a linear voltage ramp. The maximum charge current \nfollows this voltage. Thus, the charge current increases \nfrom zero to the fully programmed value as the capacitor \ncharges from 0V to 1V. The value of C RNG/SS  is calculated \nbased on the desired time to full current (t SS) following \nthe relation:\n CRNG/SS  = 50µA • t SS\nThe RNG/SS pin is pulled to ground internally when charg-\ning is terminated so each new charging cycle begins with \na soft-start cycle.  RNG/SS is also pulled to ground during  \nbad\n-battery and NTC fault conditions, so a graceful recovery  \nfrom these faults is possible.applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 6.

These pins \ncan accept voltages as high as V IN, and can sink up to \n10mA when enabled.The CHRG pin indicates that the charger is delivering cur-\nrent at greater than a C/10 rate, or one-tenth of the pro-\ngrammed maximum charge current. The FAUL T pin signals \nbad-battery and NTC faults. These pins are binary coded, \nand signal following the table below, where On indicates \nthe pin pulled low, and Off indicates pin high impedance:voltage is achieved, the charge current falls until the C/10 \nthreshold is reached, at which time the charger terminates and the LT3650 enters standby mode. The CHRG status \npin follows the charger cycle and is high impedance when \nthe charger is not actively charging.\nWhen V\nBAT drops below 97.5% of the full-charged float \nvoltage, whether by battery loading or replacement of the \nbattery, the charger automatically re-engages and starts \ncharging.There is no provision for bad-battery detection if C/10 \ntermination is used.\nTimer Termination\nThe LT3650 supports a timer- based termination scheme, in  \nwhich a battery charge cycle is terminated after a  specific  \namount \nof time elapses. Timer termination is engaged \nwhen a capacitor (C TIMER ) is connected from the TIMER \npin to ground. The timer cycle EOC (t EOC) occurs based \non C TIMER  following the relation:\n CTIMER  = tEOC • 2.27 • 10–7   (Hours)\nTimer EOC is typically set to three hours, which requires \na 0.68µF capacitor.\nThe CHRG status pin continues to signal charging at a C/10 \nrate, regardless of which termination scheme is used. When  \ntimer termination is used, the CHRG status pin is pulled \nlow during a charging cycle until the charger output cur-\nrent falls below the C/10 threshold. The charger continues \nto top off the battery until timer EOC, when the LT3650 \nterminates the charging cycle and enters standby mode.\nTermination at the end of the timer cycle only occurs if \nthe charging cycle was successful. A successful charge \ncycle occurs when the battery is charged to within 2.5% of the full-charge float voltage. If a charge cycle is not \nsuccessful at EOC, the timer cycle resets and charging \ncontinues for another full timer cycle.\nWhen V\nBAT drops below 97.5% of the full-charge float \nvoltage, whether by battery loading or replacement of \nthe battery, the charger automatically re-engages and \nstarts charging.applica Tions inForMaTion\nTable 1.

An \nLED connected to this pin will exhibit a blinking pattern, \nindicating to the user that a battery is not present. The \nfrequency of this blinking pattern is dependent on the \noutput capacitance. \nC/10 Termination\nThe LT3650 supports a low current based termination \nscheme, where a battery charge cycle terminates when \nthe current output from the charger falls to below one-\ntenth the maximum current, as programmed with R SENSE .  \nThe C/10 threshold current corresponds to 10mV across \nRSENSE . This termination mode is engaged by shorting \nthe TIMER pin to ground.When C /10 termination is used, an LT3650 charger sources  \nbattery charge current as long as the average current level \nremains above the C/10 threshold. As the full-charge float  \nLT3650-8.2/LT3650-8.4\n16\n36508284fdPreconditioning and Bad-Battery Fault\nAn LT3650 charger has a precondition mode, in which \ncharge current is limited to 15% of the programmed I MAX, \nas set by R SENSE . The precondition current corresponds \nto 15mV across R SENSE .\nPrecondition mode is engaged while the voltage on the BAT \npin is below the precondition threshold (V BAT(PRE)). Once \nthe BAT voltage rises above the precondition threshold, \nnormal full-current charging can commence. The LT3650 \nincorporates 1.5% of threshold hysteresis to prevent \nmode glitching.\nWhen the internal timer is used for termination, bad-\nbattery detection is engaged. This fault detection feature is designed to identify failed cells. A bad-battery fault is \ntriggered when the voltage on BAT remains below the \nprecondition threshold for greater than one-eighth of a \nfull timer cycle (one-eighth EOC). A bad-battery fault is \nalso triggered if a normally charging battery re-enters \nprecondition mode after one-eighth EOC.\nWhen a bad-battery fault is triggered, the charging cycle \nis suspended, so the CHRG status pin becomes high \nimpedance. The FAUL T pin is pulled low to signal a fault \ndetection. The RNG/SS pin is also pulled low during this \nfault, to accommodate a graceful restart , in the event that \na \nsoft-start function is incorporated (see the RNG/SS: \nSoft-Start section).Cycling the charger’s power or SHDN function initiates \na new charging cycle, but an LT3650 charger does not \nrequire a reset. Once a bad-battery fault is detected, a new \ntimer charging cycle initiates when the BAT pin exceeds \nthe precondition threshold voltage. During a bad-battery \nfault, 0.5mA is sourced from the charger; removing the \nfailed battery allows the charger output voltage to rise and \ninitiate a charge cycle reset. As such, removing a bad bat-\ntery resets the LT3650, so a new charge cycle is started \nby connecting another battery to the charger output.Battery Temperature Fault: NTCThe LT3650 can accommodate battery temperature moni-\ntoring by using an NTC (negative temperature coefficient) \nthermistor close to the battery pack. The temperature \nmonitoring function is enabled by connecting a 10kΩ  \nB = 3380 NTC thermistor from the NTC pin to ground. If \nthe NTC function is not desired, leave the pin unconnected.\nThe NTC pin sources 50µA, and monitors the voltage \ndropped across the 10kΩ thermistor. When the voltage \non this pin is above 1.36V (0°C) or below 0.29V (40°C), \nthe battery temperature  \n is out of range, and the LT3650 \ntriggers an NTC fault. The NTC fault condition remains until \nthe voltage on the NTC pin corresponds to a temperature within the 0°C to 40°C range. Both hot and cold thresholds \nincorporate hysteresis that corresponds to 5°C.\nIf higher operational charging temperatures are desired, \nthe temperature range can be expanded by adding se-\nries resistance to the 10k NTC resistor. Adding a 0.91k \nresistor will increase the effective temperature threshold  \nto 45°C.During an NTC fault, charging is halted and both status \npins are pulled low. If timer termination is enabled, the \ntimer count is suspended and held until the fault condi-\ntion is relieved. The RNG/SS pin is also pulled low during \nthis fault, to accommodate a graceful restart in the event \nthat a soft-start function is being incorporated (see the  \nRNG/SS: Soft-Start section).\nThermal Foldback\nThe LT3650 contains a thermal foldback protection feature \nthat reduces maximum charger output current if the IC \njunction temperature approaches 125°C. In most cases, \non-chip temperatures servo such that any overtempera-\nture conditions are relieved with only slight reductions in \nmaximum charger current.\nIn some cases, the thermal  foldback protection feature \ncan \nreduce charger currents below the C/10 threshold. In \napplications that use C/10 termination (TIMER = 0V), the \nLT3650 will suspend charging and enter standby mode \nuntil the overtemperature condition is relieved.applica Tions inForMaTion\nLT3650-8.2/LT3650-8.4\n17\n36508284fdLayout Considerations\nThe LT3650 switch node has rise and fall times that are \ntypically less than 10ns to maximize conversion efficiency.  \nThe switched node (Pin SW) trace should be kept as short \nas possible to minimize high frequency noise. The input \ncapacitor ( CIN) should be placed close to the IC to minimize  \nthis switching noise. Short, wide traces on these nodes \nalso help to avoid voltage stress from inductive ringing.  \nThe BOOST decoupling capacitor should also be in close \nproximity to the IC to minimize inductive ringing. The \nSENSE and BAT traces should be routed together and \nkept as short as possible. Shielding these signals from \nswitching noise with ground is recommended.\nHigh current paths and transients should be kept iso-\nlated from battery ground, to assure an accurate output voltage reference. Effective grounding can be achieved \nby considering switched current in the ground plane, \nand careful component placement and orientation can effectively steer these high currents such that the battery \nreference does not get corrupted. Figure 9 illustrates an effective grounding scheme using component placement \nto control ground currents. When the switch is enabled \n(loop #1), current flows from the input bypass capacitor \n(C\nIN) through the switch and inductor to the battery posi-\ntive \nterminal. When the switch is disabled (loop #2), the \ncurrent to the battery positive terminal is provided from ground through the freewheeling Schottky diode (D\nF). In \nboth cases, these switched currents return to ground via \nthe output bypass capacitor (C BAT).\nThe LT3650 packaging has been designed to efficiently \nremove heat from the IC via the exposed pad on the backside of the package, which is soldered to a copper \nfootprint on the PCB. This footprint should be made as \nlarge as possible to reduce the thermal resistance of the \nIC case to ambient air.applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 9.
