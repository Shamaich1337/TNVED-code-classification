At power on, the I/Os are configured as\ninputs. However, the system master can enable the\nI/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O\nconfiguration bits. The data for each input or output\nis kept in the corresponding Input or Output register.\nThe polarity of the Input Port register can be inverted\nwith the Polarity Inversion register. All registers can be\nread by the system master.\nThe system master can reset the PCA9534 in the\nevent of a timeout or other improper operation by\nutilizing the power-on reset feature, which puts the\nregisters in their default state and initializes the I2C/\nSMBus state machine.\nThe PCA9534 open-drain interrupt ( INT) output\nis activated when any input state differs from its\ncorresponding input port register state and is used to\nindicate to the system master that an input state has\nchanged.\nDevice Information (1)\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nPCA9534SSOP (16) 6.20 mm × 5.30 mm\nVQFN (16) 4.00 mm × 4.00 mm\nQFN (16) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the datasheet.\nspacer\nDB,□DGV,□DW,□OR□PW□PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n816\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9A0\nA1\nA2\nP0\nP1\nP2\nP3\nGNDVCC\nSDA\nSCL\nINT\nP7\nP6\nP5\nP4RGV□PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\n16\n6 82\n10P7P5431\n7 512\n11\n9131415\nSDAA0A1\nP6INTSCLP3\nGND\nP4A2\nP0\nP1\nP2RGT□PACKAGE\n(TOP VIEW)\n16\n6 82\n10P7P5431\n7 512\n11\n9131415\nSDAA0A1\nP6INTSCLP3\nGND\nP4A2\nP0\nP1\nP2VCC\nVCCwww.ti.comPCA9534\nSCPS124H – SEPTEMBER 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9534PCA9534\nSCPS124H – SEPTEMBER 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the\nremote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data on its ports without having to communicate via\nthe I2C bus. Thus, the PCA9534 can remain a simple slave device.\nThe device\'s outputs (latched) have high-current drive capability for directly driving LEDs. It has low current\nconsumption.\nThree hardware pins (A0, A1, and A2) are used to program and vary the fixed I2C address and allow up to eight\ndevices to share the same I2C bus or SMBus.\nThe PCA9534 is pin-to-pin and I2C address compatible with the PCF8574. However, software changes are\nrequired due to the enhancements in the PCA9534 over the PCF8574.\nThe PCA9534 is a low-power version of the PCA9554. The only difference between the PCA9534 and PCA9554\nis that the PCA9534 eliminates an internal I/O pullup resistor, which dramatically reduces power consumption in\nthe standby mode when the I/Os are held low.\nThe PCA9534A and PCA9534 are identical, except for their fixed I2C address. This allows for up to 16 of these\ndevices (8 of each) on the same I2C bus.www.ti.comPCA9534\nSCPS124H – SEPTEMBER 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9534\n5 Device Comparison Table\nDEVICEMAX\nFREQUEN\nCYI2C\nADDRES\nSNO.

Simplified Schematic of P0 to P7\n9.2 Device Functional Modes\n9.2.1 Power-On Reset\nWhen power (from 0 V) is applied to V CC, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9534 in a reset condition until\nVCC has reached V POR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the PCA9534  registers and I2C/SMBus\nstate machine initialize to their default states. After that, V CC must be lowered to below 0.2 V and then back up to\nthe operating voltage for a power-reset cycle.\n9.2.2 I/O Port\nWhen an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 (in Figure 9-2 ) are off, creating a high-impedance input.\nThe input voltage may be raised above V CC to a maximum of 5.5 V.\nIf the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the output port register.\nIn this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and either V CC or GND. The external voltage\napplied to this I/O pin should not exceed the recommended levels for proper operation.\n9.2.3 Interrupt Output ( INT)\nAn interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the input mode. After time, t iv,\nthe signal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when data on the port is changed to the\noriginal setting, data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. Resetting occurs in the read mode at the\nacknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal.\nInterrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the resetting\nof the interrupt during this pulse. Each change of the I/Os after resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.\nWriting to another device does not affect the interrupt circuit, and a pin configured as an output cannot causePCA9534\nSCPS124H – SEPTEMBER 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9534\nan interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the\npin does not match the contents of the Input Port register. Because each 8-pin port is read independently, the\ninterrupt caused by port 0 is not cleared by a read of port 1 or vice versa.\nThe INT output has an open-drain structure and requires pullup resistor to V CC.\n9.2.3.1 Interrupt Errata\n9.2.3.1.1 Description\nThe INT will be improperly de-asserted if the following two conditions occur:\n1. The last I2C command byte (register pointer) written to the device was 00h.\nNote\nThis generally means the last operation with the device was a Read of the input register. However,\nthe command byte may have been written with 00h without ever going on to read the input register.\nAfter reading from the device, if no other command byte written, it will remain 00h.\n2. Any other slave device on the I2C bus acknowledges an address byte with the R/W bit set high\n9.2.3.1.2 System Impact\nCan cause improper interrupt handling as the Master will see the interrupt as being cleared.\n9.2.3.1.3 System Workaround\nMinor software change: User must change command byte to something besides 00h after a Read operation to\nthe PCA9534 device or before reading from another slave device.\nNote\nSoftware change will be compatible with other versions (competition and TI redesigns) of this device.\n9.3 Programming\n9.3.1 I2C Interface\nThe bidirectional I2C bus consists of the serial clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA) lines. Both lines must be\nconnected to a positive supply through a pullup resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data\ntransfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\nI2C communication with this device is initiated by a master sending a Start condition, a high-to-low transition on\nthe SDA input/output while the SCL input is high (see Figure 9-3 ). After the Start condition, the device address\nbyte is sent, most significant bit (MSB) first, including the data direction bit (R/ W).\nAfter receiving the valid address byte, this device responds with an acknowledge (ACK), a low on the SDA\ninput/output during the high of the ACK-related clock pulse. The address inputs (A0–A2) of the slave device must\nnot be changed between the Start and Stop conditions.\nOn the I2C bus, only one data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain\nstable during the high pulse of the clock period, as changes in the data line at this time are interpreted as control\ncommands (Start or Stop) (see Figure 9-4 ).\nA Stop condition, a low-to-high transition on the SDA input/output while the SCL input is high, is sent by the\nmaster (see Figure 9-3 ).\nAny number of data bytes can be transferred from the transmitter to receiver between the Start and Stop\nconditions. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one ACK bit. The transmitter must release the SDA line before\nthe receiver can send an ACK bit. The device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the ACK\nclock pulse so that the SDA line is stable low during the high pulse of the ACK-related clock period (see Figure\n9-5). When a slave receiver is addressed, it must generate an ACK after each byte is received. Similarly, the\nmaster must generate an ACK after each byte that it receives from the slave transmitter. Setup and hold times\nmust be met to ensure proper operation.www.ti.comPCA9534\nSCPS124H – SEPTEMBER 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9534\nA master receiver will signal an end of data to the slave transmitter by not generating an acknowledge (NACK)\nafter the last byte has been clocked out of the slave. This is done by the master receiver by holding the SDA line\nhigh. In this event, the transmitter must release the data line to enable the master to generate a Stop condition.\nSDA\nSCL\nStart ConditionS\nStop ConditionP\nFigure 9-3.

Two bits of this command byte state the operation (read or write)\nand the internal register (input, output, polarity inversion or configuration) that will be affected. This register can\nbe written or read through the I2C bus. The command byte is sent only during a write transmission.\nOnce a command byte has been sent, the register that was addressed continues to be accessed by reads until a\nnew command byte has been sent.\n0 0 0 0 B1 B0 0 0\nFigure 9-7.

It only acts on read operation. Writes to these\nregisters have no effect. The default value, X, is determined by the externally applied logic level.\nBefore a read operation, a write transmission is sent with the command byte to let the I2C device know that the\nInput Port register will be accessed next.www.ti.comPCA9534\nSCPS124H – SEPTEMBER 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9534\nTable 9-4.

The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is accessed. After a\nrestart, the device address is sent again but, this time, the LSB is set to a logic 1.

After a restart, the value\nof the register defined by the command byte matches the register being accessed when the restart occurred.\nData is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse.

Because the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off, the I/O V IN is about 1.2 V less than\nVCC. The supply current, I CC, increases as V IN becomes lower than V CC and is specified as ΔICC in Electrical\nCharacteristics .\nFor battery-powered applications, it is essential that the voltage of the I/O pins is greater than or equal to V CC\nwhen the LED is off to minimize current consumption. Figure 10-2  shows a high-value resistor in parallel with the\nLED. Figure 10-3  shows V CC less than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain\nthe I/O V IN at or above V CC and prevents additional supply-current consumption when the LED is off.\nLED\nLEDxVCC100 k/C0087VCC\nFigure 10-2.

Power-on reset requires that the device go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This\nreset also happens when the device is powered on for the first time in an application.\nThe two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 11-1  and Figure 11-2 .\nVCC\nRamp-Up Re-Ramp-Up\nTime to Re-RampTimeRamp-Down\nVCC_RTVCC_RTVCC_FTVCC_TRR_GND\nFigure 11-1.

The glitch width\n(VCC_GW ) and height (V CC_GH ) are dependent on each other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and\nthe device impedance are factors that affect power-on reset performance. Figure 11-3  and Table 11-1  provide\nmore information on how to measure these specifications.www.ti.comPCA9534\nSCPS124H – SEPTEMBER 2006 – REVISED MARCH 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9534\nVCC\nTimeVCC_GH\nVCC_GWFigure 11-3.
