The IC operates \naccording to IR\'s proprietary "One Cycle Control" \n(OCC) PFC algorithm, which is based on the re-settable integrator principle. When operating a \nAC-DC Boost converter, power factor correction \ncan be achieved using this algorithm without AC \ninput line sensing. \n \nTheory of Operation \nThe OCC algorithm works using two loops - a \nslow outer voltage loop and a fast inner current loop. The outer voltage loop monitors the VFB \npin to maintain regulation of boost converter \noutput voltage and generates a constant error signal. The inner current loop exploits the \nembedded input voltage information in the boost \nconverter duty cycle to generate a current \nreference for power factor correction.  The \ncombination of the two control elements forces \nthe amplitude and shape of the input current to be proportional to and in phase with the input \nvoltage while maintaining output voltage \nregulation. This is true so long as operation in continuous conduction mode is maintained.  \nAverage current mode operation is envisaged by \nfiltering the switching frequency ripple from the \ncurrent sense signal in the current loop using an \non-chip filter.   \nThe IC determines the boost converter \ninstantaneous duty cycle using the voltage feedback loop error signal V\nm and the current \nsense signal V ISNS, which is the voltage at the \ncurrent sense pin of the IC. The PWM ramp is generated using a resettable integrator that \ntracks V\nm every switching cycle. The current \nsense signal is amplified by the current amplifier averaged to remove the ripple component and \nfed into the summing node where it is subtracted \nfrom the voltage error signal, V\nm. The resulting \nvoltage (V m - g DC.VISNS) is compared with the \nPWM ramp signal by the PWM comparator to \ndetermine the gate drive duty cycle. The instantaneous duty cycle is mathematically given \nby: \nD = (V\nm - g DC.VISNS) /V m \nA more detailed description of IR1155 theory of \noperation is available in Application Note. Feature set \nThe IR1155 offers a host of advanced features and \nsystem protections functions, which makes it the \nmost feature-intensive IC in PFC market in a \ncompact 8-pin package.   User-Programmable Switching Frequency \nIR1155 IC operates under fixed switching \nfrequency. The switching frequency is user-\nprogrammed by inserting a capacitor between \nFREQ & COM pins. A pair of current sources inside \nthe IC source/sink current in/out of the capacitor \nalternately thus generating a constant-slope saw-tooth ramp signal between a pre-determined peak & \nvalley voltage pair (typically between 2V to 4V). This \nsaw-tooth signal is the os cillator signal of the IC. \nThe frequency of operation of the IC can be \nprogrammed anywhere between 48kHz and 200kHz \nby suitably sizing t he capacitor. The oscillator signal \nis a key control signal and is used by the resettable \nintegrator block of the IC to generate the internal \nPWM ramp every switching cycle. \n \nIC Supply Circuit & Low start-up current The IR1155 UVLO circuit maintains the IC in UVLO \nmode during start-up if VCC pin voltage is less than \nthe VCC turn-on threshold, V\nCC,ON and current \nconsumption is less than I CC,START . Should VCC pin \nvoltage should drop below UVLO threshold V CC, UVLO  \nanytime after start-up, the IC is pushed back into \nUVLO mode (VCOMP pin is discharged) and VCC \npin has to exceed V CC,ON again to re-start operation. \nIt is noted that there is no internal clamping of the VCC pin. \n \nUser initiated Micropower Sleep mode \nThe IC can be actively pushed into a micropower sleep mode where current consumption is less than \nI\nCC,SLEEP  by pulling OVP/EN pin below the Sleep \nthreshold, V SLEEP(OFF) , even while VCC is above \nVCC,ON . This allows the user to disable PFC during \napplication stand-by situations in order to meet regulations (Blue Angel, Green Power etc). When \nOVP/EN pin is pulled low, the VCOMP pin of the IC \nis actively discharged as the IC is relegated to the Sleep mode. This enables the IC to go through soft-\nstart when the IC is re-enabled. Since V\nSLEEP(OFF)  is \nless than 1V, even logic level signals can be employed to disable and enable the IC. \n \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 12 © 2011 International Rectifier \n IR1155 General Description \nProgrammable Soft Start \nThe soft start process controls the rate of rise of \nthe voltage feedback loop error signal thus providing a linear control on RMS input current \nthat the PFC converter will admit. The soft start \ntime is essentially c ontrolled by voltage error \namplifier compensation components selected and \nis therefore user programmable to some degree \nbased on desired loop crossover frequency.   Gate Drive Capability \nThe gate drive output stage of the IC is a totem pole driver with 1.5A  peak current drive \ncapability. The gate drive is  internally clamped at \n13V (Typ). Gate drive buffer circuits can be easily \ndriven with the GATE pin of the IC to suit any \nsystem power level.  System Protection Features \nIR1155 protection features include DC bus \nOvervoltage protection (OVP) via a dedicated pin, \nOpen-loop protection (OLP), Cycle-by-cycle peak \ncurrent limit (IPK LIMIT), Soft-current limit and VCC under voltage lock-out (UVLO).  \n \n- Overvoltage voltage protection (OVP) feature in IR1155 is achieved using a dedicated pin called \nthe OVP/EN pin. The input of OVP comparator is \nconnected the OVP pin. When the OVP pin voltage exceeds V\nOVP, an overvoltage situation is \ndetected and the gate drive is immediately \nterminated. The gate drive is re-enabled only \nafter OVP pin voltage drops below V OVP(RST) . The \nuse of a dedicated OVP/EN pin ensures that the system is protected from catastrophic \novervoltages, even if  the feed-back loop \n(connected to the VFB pin) encounters any failure. This ensures the best possible system \novervoltage protection against extremes of \nsituations.  \n- Open Loop Protection (OLP) is activated \nwhenever the VFB pin voltage falls below V\nOLP \nthreshold. The gate drive is then immediately \ndisabled, VCOMP is actively discharged and the \nIC is pushed into Stand-by mode. The IC will re-start (with soft-start) once the VFB pin voltage \nexceeds V\nOLP again. There is no voltage \nhysteresis associated with  this feature. During \nstart-up the IC is held in Stand-by until this pin \nexceeds V OLP.  - Soft-current limit is an output voltage fold-back type \nprotection feature that is  encountered when the RMS \ncurrent in the PFC converter exceeds a certain magnitude that causes the internal error signal of the \nvoltage feedback, V\nm to saturate at its highest value. \nAmplitude of V m signal is directly proportional to the \nRMS input current admitted into the PFC converter. \nIn effect, once V m saturates, the maximum RMS \ncurrent admissible into the PFC converter has been encountered. Any attempt to increase the RMS \ncurrent beyond this limit ca uses the IC to limit the \nduty cycle delivered to the PFC converter, which then \nhas the effect of causing the DC bus voltage to droop \ni.e. output voltage folds-back.  The current level at which V\nm saturates is closely related to the value of \nthe current sense resistor selected for the PFC \nconverter. In one way, this feature can be perceived to offer an overpower limitation of sorts at the \nconditions at which current sense design is \nperformed (minimum VAC & maximum output power). For details, please refer to IR1155 \nApplication Note. \n - Cycle-by-cycle peak cu rrent limit protection \ninstantaneously turns-off the gate output whenever \nthe ISNS pin voltage exceeds V\nISNS(PK)  threshold in \nmagnitude. The gate drive output is re-enabled only \nafter the magnitude of the ISNS pin voltage drops \nbelow the V ISNS(PK)  threshold. It is clarified that even \nthough the IC operates based on average current \nmode control, since the averaging circuit is \ndecoupled from the peak current limit comparator \ninput, the IC is still able to provide instantaneous \nresponse to a system overcurrent condition. This protection feature incorporates a leading edge \nblanking circuit following the comparator to improve \nnoise immunity.\n  \n \n- VCC Under Voltage Lockout protection maintains \nthe IC in a low current consumption, UVLO mode \nduring start-up if VCC pin voltage is less than the VCC turn-on threshold, V\nCC,ON. In UVLO mode the \ncurrent consumption is less than I CC,START  which is \ntypically about 200uA. Should VCC pin voltage should drop below UVLO threshold V\nCC, UVLO  anytime \nafter start-up, the IC is pushed back into UVLO mode \n(VCOMP pin is discharged) and VCC pin has to exceed V\nCC,ON  again to re-start operation.  \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 13 © 2011 International Rectifier \n IR1155 Pin Description \nPin COM:  This is ground potential pin of the IC.   \nAll internal devices are referenced to this point. A \nstar-connection point, very close to this pin, is recommended in PCB lay-out in order to \nreference the return traces of the various control \nloops to the COM potential of the IC.   \nPin COMP:  External circuitry from this pin to \nground compensates the system voltage loop and programs the soft start time. The COMP pin is \nessentially the output of the voltage error \namplifier. VCOMP is actively discharged using an \ninternal switch & resistance inside the IC \nwhenever the IC is pushed into Stand-by mode (Open Loop Condition) or UVLO/Sleep mode. The \nIC is designed not to start-up (from UVLO, Sleep \nor Stand-by modes) when there is a pre-bias on VCOMP pin that is greater than V\nCOMP,START . The \nVCOMP-COM loop represents a very important \ncontrol loop to the IC and hence a dedicated PCB trace loop is recommended for layout (star-\nconnection to GND potential) for noise free, stable \noperation.  \nPin ISNS:  ISNS pin is the inverting input to the \ncurrent sense amplifier of the IC.  The voltage at this pin is the negative voltage drop sensed \nacross the system current sense resistor and thus \nrepresents the inductor current sense signal to the IC for determining gate drive duty cycle. ISNS pin \nis also the inverting input to the cycle-by-cycle \npeak current limit comparator. Whenever this pin \nvoltage exceeds V\nISNS(PK)  threshold in magnitude, \nthe gate drive is instantaneously disabled. Any external filtering of the ISNS pin must be \nperformed carefully in order to ensure that the \nintegrity of the current sense signal is maintained for cycle-by-cycle protection. \n \nPin FREQ: This is the user-programmable \nfrequency pin. The switching frequency is \nprogrammed by inserting a capacitor between \nFREQ & COM pins. A pair of current sources inside the IC source/sink current in/out of the \ncapacitor alternately thus generating a constant-\nslope saw-tooth ramp signal between a pre-determined peak & valley voltage pair (typically \nbetween 2V to 4V). This saw-tooth signal is the \noscillator signal of t he IC. The frequency of \noperation of the IC can be programmed anywhere \nbetween 48kHz and 200kHz by suitably sizing the \ncapacitor.  \n The FREQ-COM loop represents yet another very \nimportant control loop to the IC and hence a \ndedicated PCB trace loop is recommended in lay-\nout (star-connection to GND potential) for noise free, stable operation. \n \nPin OVP/EN:  The OVP/EN pin is connected to the \ninput of the overvoltage comparator and is used to \ndetect output overvoltage situations. The output \nvoltage information is communicated to the OVP pin using a resistive divider. This pin also serves the \nsecond purpose of an ENABLE pin. The OVP/EN \npin can be used to activate the IC into “micropower \nsleep” mode by pulling the voltage on this pin below \nthe V\nSLEEP  threshold.  \n \nPin VFB: The converter output voltage is sensed \nvia a resistive divider and fed into this pin. VFB pin is the inverting input of  the output voltage error \namplifier. The non-inverting input of this amplifier is \nconnected to an internal 5V reference. The impedance of the divider string must be low enough \nthat it does not introduce substantial error due to the \ninput bias currents of the amplifier, yet high enough to minimize power dissipation.  Typical value of \nexternal divider impedance will be 1M Ω.  VFB pin is \nalso the inverting input to the Open Loop comparator. The IC is held in Stand-by Mode \nwhenever VFB pin voltage is below V\nOLP threshold.   \n Pin VCC:  This is the supply voltage pin of the IC \nand sense node for the under-voltage lock out \ncircuit.  It is possible to turn off the IC by pulling this \npin below the minimum turn off threshold voltage, \nV\nCC,UVLO  without damage to the IC.  This pin is not \ninternally clamped. \n \nPin GATE:  This is the gate drive output of the IC.  \nThis drive voltage is internally clamped to 13V(Typ) \nand provides a drive current of ±1.5A peak with \nmatched rise and fall times.  \n \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 14 © 2011 International Rectifier \n IR1155 Modes of operation (refer to States & Transitions Diagram) \nUVLO/Sleep Mode: The IC is in the UVLO/Sleep \nmode when either the VCC pin voltage is below \nVCC,UVLO  and/or the OVP/EN pin voltage is below \nVSLEEP . The UVLO/Sleep mode is accessible from \nany other state of operation. This mode can be \nactively invoked by pulling the OVP/EN pin below \nthe Sleep threshold V SLEEP even if VCC pin \nvoltage is above V CC,ON . In the UVLO/Sleep state, \nthe gate drive circuit is inactive, most of the \ninternal circuitry is unbiased and the IC draws a quiescent current of I\nSLEEP  which is typically 200uA \nor less. Also, the internal logic of the IC ensures \nthat whenever the UVLO/Sleep mode is actively \ninvoked, the COMP pin is actively discharged \nbelow V COMP,START  prior to entering the sleep \nmode, in order to facilitate soft-start upon \nresumption of operation. \n Stand-by Mode: The IC is placed in Stand-by \nmode whenever an Open-loop situation is \ndetected. An open-loop situation is sensed anytime VFB pin voltage is less than V\nOLP.  All \ninternal circuitry is biased in the Stand-by Mode, \nbut the gate is inactive and the IC draws a few mA of current.  This state is accessible from any other \nstate of operation of the IC. COMP pin is actively \ndischarged to below V\nCOMP,START  whenever this \nstate is entered from normal operation in order to \nfacilitate soft-start upon re sumption of operation. \n Soft Start Mode:  During system start-up, the soft-\nstart mode is activated once the VCC voltage has \nexceeded V\nCC,ON, the VFB pin voltage has \nexceeded V OLP and OVP pin voltage has \nexceeded V SLEEP(ON) . The soft start time is the time \nrequired for the VCOMP voltage to charge \nthrough its entire dynamic range i.e. through \nVCOMP,EFF . As a result, the soft-start time is \ndependent upon the component values selected \nfor compensation of the voltage loop on the \nCOMP pin. As VCOMP voltage raises gradually, the IC allows a higher and higher RMS current \ninto the PFC converter.  This controlled increase \nof the input current amplitude contributes to reducing system component stress during start-\nup. It is clarified that, during soft-start, the IC is \ncapable of full duty cycle modulation (from 0% to MAX DUTY), based on the instantaneous ISNS \nsignal from system current sensing. .\n For all practical purposes, the Soft-start mode of \nthe IC is the same as the Normal mode (only \ndifference being that the DC bus voltage is \napproaching the regulation point). All protection \nfunctions of the IC are active during soft-start \nmode. \n Normal Mode: The IC enters the normal operating \nmode seamlessly following conclusion of soft-start.  \nAt this point the DC bus is well regulated and all protection functions of the IC are active.  If, from \nthe normal mode, the IC is pushed into either a \nStand-by mode or Sleep mode then COMP pin is \nactively discharged below V\nCOMP,START  and system \nwill go through soft-start upon resumption of operation. \n \nOVP Mode: The IC enters OVP fault mode \nwhenever an overvoltage condition is detected. A \nsystem overvoltage condit ion is recognized when \nOVP/EN pin voltage exceeds V\nOVP threshold. When \nthis happens the IC immediately disables the gate \ndrive. The gate drive is re-enabled only when \nOVP/EN pin voltage is less than V OVP(RST)  \nthreshold. This state is accessible from both the \nsoft start and normal modes of operation. \n IPK LIMIT Mode: The IC enters IPK LIMIT fault \nmode whenever the magnitude of  ISNS pin voltage \nexceeds the V\nISNS(PK)  threshold triggering cycle-by-\ncycle peak over current protection. When this \nhappens, the IC immediately disables the gate \ndrive. Gate drive is re-enabled when magnitude of \nISNS pin voltage drops below V ISNS(PK)  threshold. \nThis state is accessible from both the soft start and normal modes of operation. \n \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 15 © 2011 International Rectifier \n  \n0.010.1110\n7.0 V 9.0 V 11.0 V 13.0 V 15.0 V 17.0 VISUPPLY  (mA)\nSupply voltage \n \nFigure 1: Supply Current vs.  \nSupply Voltage 9.0 V9.5 V10.0 V10.5 V11.0 V11.5 V12.0 V\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CVCC UVLO Thresholds\nTe m p e r a t u r eVCC UV+\nVCC UV-\n \n \nFigure 2: Undervoltage Lockout vs. \nTemperature  \n8.78.88.99.09.19.29.39.49.59.69.7\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CICCSupply Current (mA)\nT emperatureIcc @ C LOAD=1nF\n \n \nFigure 3: Icc Current vs. Temperature \n(@181kHz frequency)  50.070.090.0110.0130.0150.0170.0\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CCurrent (uA)\nTe m p e r a t u r eICCSTART and I SLEEP\nISLEEP\nICCSTART\n \nFigure 4: Startup Current and Sleep \nCurrent vs. Temperature \n \n \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 16 © 2011 International Rectifier \n 20.040.060.080.0100.0120.0140.0160.0180.0200.0\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CSwitching Frequency (KHz)\nTe m p e r a t u r eCT=500pF\nCT=2nF\n \n \nFigure 5: Switchi ng Frequency vs.  \nTemperature 4.954.974.995.015.035.05\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CReference Voltage (V)\nT emperature\n \nFigure 6: Reference Voltage vs. \nTemperature  \n40.042.044.046.048.050.052.054.0\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CEA T ransconductance g m(uS)\nTe m p e r a t u r e \n \nFigure 7: Voltage Error Amplifier \nTransconductance vs. Temperature  10.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.0\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CError Amplifier Source/Sink Current (uA)\nT emperatureSource\n|Sink|\n \nFigure 8: Voltage Error Amplifier Source \n& Sink Current vs. Temperature \n \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 17 © 2011 International Rectifier \n  \n3.003.053.103.153.203.253.30\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CCurrent Sense Amplifier DC Gain g DC(V/V)\nT emperature\n \n \nFigure 9: Current Amplifier DC Gain vs.  \nTemperature -1.0-0.9-0.8-0.7-0.6-0.5\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °CPeak Current Limit Threshold (V)\nT emperature\n \nFigure 10: Peak Current Limit Threshold \nVISNS(PK)  vs. Temperature  \n1.001.021.041.061.081.10\n-50 °C 0 °C 50 °C 100 °C 150 °COVP Threshold (%Vref)\nTe m p e r a t u r eVOVP\nVOVP(RST)\n \n \nFigure 11: Over Vo ltage Protection \nThresholds vs. Temperature  40.0060.0080.00100.00120.00140.00160.00180.00200.00\n400 650 900 1150 1400 1650 1900Frequency \xa0(KHz)\nCT\xa0(pF)Frequency \xa0vs.\xa0CT\n \nFigure 12: Oscillator Frequency vs. \nProgramming Capacitor \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 18 © 2011 International Rectifier \n  \nPackage Details: SOIC8N  \n \n   \n   \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 19 © 2011 International Rectifier \n Tape and Reel Details: SOIC8N \n \n    \n \n   \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n   \n EFA\nCD\nGA B H\nNOTE : CONTROLLING \nDIMENSION IN MMLOADED TAPE FEED DIRECTION\nA\nHF\nE\nGD\nB\nCCARRIER TAPE DIMENSION FOR 8SOICN\nCode Min Max Min Max\nA 7.90 8.10 0.311 0.318B 3.90 4.10 0.153 0.161C 11.70 12.30 0.46 0.484D 5.45 5.55 0.214 0.218E 6.30 6.50 0.248 0.255\nF 5.10 5.30 0.200 0.208\nG 1.50 n/a 0.059 n/aH 1.50 1.60 0.059 0.062Metric Imperial\nREEL DIMENSIONS FOR 8SOICN\nCode Min Max Min Max\nA 329.60 330.25 12.976 13.001B 20.95 21.45 0.824 0.844\nC 12.80 13.20 0.503 0.519\nD 1.95 2.45 0.767 0.096E 98.00 102.00 3.858 4.015\nF n/a 18.40 n/a 0.724\nG 14.50 17.10 0.570 0.673\nH 12.40 14.40 0.488 0.566Metric Imperial\n \n \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 20 © 2011 International Rectifier \n  \nPart Marking Information  \n \n IR1155S\n \n \nwww.irf.com 21 © 2011 International Rectifier \n Ordering Information \nStandard Pack \nBase Part Number Package Type \nForm QuantityComplete Part Number \nTube/Bulk 95 IR1155SPBF \nIR1155S SOIC8N \nTape and Reel 2500 IR1155STRPBF \n \n               \n       \n \n \n \nThe information provided in this document is believed to be accu rate and reliable.
