General description\nThe PCA9547 is an octal bidirectional translating multiplexer controlled by the I2C-bus. \nThe SCL/SDA upstream pair fans out to eigh t downstream pairs, or channels. Only one \nSCx/SDx channel can be selected at a ti me, determined by the contents of the \nprogrammable control register. The device po wers up with Channel 0 connected, allowing \nimmediate communication between the master and downstream devices on that channel.\nAn active LOW reset input allows the PCA9547 to recover from a situation where one of \nthe downstream I2C-buses is stuck in a LO W state. Pulling the RESET  pin LOW resets \nthe I2C-bus state machine causing all the channels to be deselected, except Channel 0 so \nthat the master can regain control of the bus.\nThe pass gates of the multiplexers are constructed such that the V DD pin can be used to \nlimit the maximum high volta ge which will be passed by the PCA9547. This a llows the use \nof different bus voltages on each pair, so that 1.8 V, 2.5 V, or 3.3 V parts can communicate \nwith 5 V parts without any additional protecti on. External pull-up resistors pull the bus up \nto the desired voltage level for each channel. All I/O pins are 5 V tolerant.\n2.

Functional description\n6.1 Device addressing\nFollowing a START condition, the bus master must output the address of the slave it is \naccessing. The address of the PCA9547 is shown in Figure 5 . To conserve power, no \ninternal pull-up resistors are incorporated on the hardware selectable address pins and \nthey must be pulled HIGH or LOW.\n \nThe last bit of the slave ad dress defines the operation to be performed. When set to \nlogic 1 a read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.\n6.2 Control register\nFollowing the successful acknowledgement of the slave address, the bus master will send a byte to the PCA9547, which will be stored in  the Control register. If multiple bytes are \nreceived by the PCA9547, it will save the last byte received. This register can be written \nand read via the I\n2C-bus.\n \n6.2.1 Control register definition\nA SCx/SDx downstream pair, or channel, is selected by the contents of the control \nregister. This register is written after t he PCA9547 has been addressed. The 4 LSBs of \nthe control byte are used to determine which channel is to be selected. When a channel is \nselected, the channel will beco me active after a STOP cond ition has been placed on the \nI2C-bus. This ensures that all SCx/SDx lines will be in a HIGH state when the channel is \nmade active, so that no false conditions are generated at the time of connection.Fig 5.

By asserting this signal LOW for a minimum of t w(rst)L , the PCA9547 will reset its \nregister and I2C-bus state machine and will deselect all channels except channel 0. The \nRESET  input must be connected to V DD through a pull-up resistor.\n6.4 Power-on reset\nWhen power is applied to V DD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9547 in \na reset condition until V DD has reached V POR. At this point, the reset condition is released \nand the PCA9547 register and I2C-bus state machine are initialized to their default states, \ncausing all the channels to be deselected except channel 0. Thereafter, V DD must be \nlowered below 0.2 V for at least 5 \uf06ds in order to reset the device.Table 4.

In order for the PCA9547 to act as a voltage translator, the V o(mux)  voltage \nshould be equal to, or lower than the lowest bus voltage. For example, if the main bus was \nrunning at 5 V, and the downstream buses were 3.3 V and 2.7 V, then V o(mux)  should be \nequal to or below 2.7 V to effectively clam p the downstream bus voltages. Looking at \nFigure 7 , we see that V o(mux)(max)  will be at 2.7 V when the PCA9547 supply voltage is \n3.5 V or lower so the PCA9547 supply voltage could be set to 3.3 V. Pull-up resistors can \nthen be used to bring the bus voltages to their appropriate levels (see Figure 14 ).\nMore information can be found in Application Note AN262,  PCA954X family of I2C/SMBus \nmultiplexers and switches .(1) maximum\n(2) typical\n(3) minimum\nFig 7.

Characteristics of the I2C-bus\nThe I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two \nlines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply via a pull-up re sistor when connected to the output stages \nof a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n7.1 Bit transfer\nOne data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain \nstable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time \nwill be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 8 ).\n \n7.1.1 START and STOP conditions\nBoth data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW \ntransition of the data line while the clock is HI GH is defined as the START condition (S). A \nLOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP \ncondition (P) (see Figure 9 .)\n Fig 8.

The \ndevice that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by \nthe master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 10 ).\n \n7.3 Acknowledge\nThe number of data bytes transferred betwe en the START and the STOP conditions from \ntransmitter to receiver is not limited. Ea ch byte of eight bits is followed by one \nacknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter, \nwhereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.\nA slave receiver which is addressed must gen erate an acknowledge af ter the reception of \neach byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte \nthat has been clocked out of the slave transm itter. The device that acknowledges has to \npull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up and hold times must be taken into account.\nA master receiver must signal an end of da ta to the transmitter by not generating an \nacknowledge on the last byte that has been cloc ked out of the slave. In this event, the \ntransmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP \ncondition.\n Fig 10.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n14.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n14.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n14.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhe sive and flux, clinching of leads, board \ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are \nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\nPCA9547 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2014. All rights res erved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 4 — 1 April 2014 22 of 30NXP Semiconductors PCA9547\n8-channel I2C-bus multiplexer with reset\n14.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\n•Lead-free versus SnPb solderi ng; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to \nhigher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 20 ) than a SnPb process, thus \nreducing the process window\n•Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process \nwindow for a mix of large and small components on one board\n•Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is \nheated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 10  and 11\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 20 .Table 10.

#### Description:
The PCA9547 is an octal bidirectional translating multiplexer controlled via the I2C-bus. It features a single SCL/SDA upstream pair that can connect to eight downstream pairs (channels). The device is designed to allow communication between different voltage levels, enabling devices operating at 1.8 V, 2.5 V, or 3.3 V to communicate with 5 V devices without additional protection. The PCA9547 powers up with Channel 0 connected, allowing immediate communication, and includes an active LOW reset input to recover from bus faults.

#### Typical Applications:
The PCA9547 is commonly used in applications requiring:
- **I2C Bus Expansion**: It allows multiple I2C devices to be connected to a single master device, facilitating communication in complex systems.
- **Voltage Level Translation**: It enables communication between devices operating at different voltage levels, making it suitable for mixed-voltage environments.
- **Signal Routing**: The multiplexer can be used to route signals selectively between different devices, enhancing system flexibility.
- **Data Acquisition Systems**: It can be employed in systems where multiple sensors or data sources need to be accessed by a single controller.

This component is ideal for applications in consumer electronics, industrial automation, and communication systems where multiple I2C devices need to be managed efficiently.
