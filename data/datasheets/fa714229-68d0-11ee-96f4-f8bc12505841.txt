DPI (RGB Interface) \nThe DPI can display moving pictures by two ways: rewrite into the GRAM and transmit \ndirectly to the shift register.  The selection is set by the register BPGRAM (bypass GRAM) and \nRM bit.The RM bit selects an interface for the access operation of the Frame Memory. For the \nDPI, RM should be set as 1. \n      \n \n \nThe DM bit selects the clock operation mode.It allows switching between display operat ionsin \nsynchronization with the internal oscillation clock.If DM=1,the external DCLK cannot be \nstopped unless it enters the Sleep-In mode. \n             \n \n \n10.5.1 RGB Interface Selection \nThe DPI can be selected by the RCM bit. When the RCM is set to 0, the DE mode is selected \nby VS,HS,DCLK,DE, and DB[17:0] (or DB[15:0]) pins. \n \nWhen RCM is set to 1,the SYNC mode is selected by VS,HS,DCLK,and DB[17:0] (or \nDB[15:0]) pins. It supports several pixel formats that can be selected by DPI[2:0] bits in Pixel \nFormat Set (R3Ah) command. The selection of a given interface is done by DPI[2:0],as shown \nin Table 1 and Figure 12. \n \n                       Table 1: DPI Interface Selection \n \n\n \nRFI350U-AYW-DNG  \n \nPage 26 , Total 38  Pages \n \n Figure 12: RGB Interface 18/16 Pixel Format Selection \n \nThe Pixel clock (DCLK) runs all the time without stop.It is used to enter VS, HS, DE and \nDB[17:0] (or DB[15:0]) states when there is a rising edge of the DCLK. The DCLK cannot be \nused as the internal clock for other functions of the display module. \n \nVertical synchronization (VS)is used to indicate when a new frame of the display is received. \nThis is low enable and its state is read to the display module by a rising edge of the DOT CLK \nsignal. \n \nHorizontal synchronization (HS)is used to indicate when a new line of the frame is received. \nThis is low enable and its state is read to the display module by a rising edge of the DOT CLK \nsignal. \n \nData Enable(DE)is used to indicate when the RGB information that should be transferred in \nthe display is received. This is a high enable, and its state is read to the display module by a \nrising edge of the DCLK signal. DB[17:0] (or DB[15:0])  is used to indicate what is the \ninformation of the image that is transferred on the display(when DE = 0 (low)and there is a \nrising edge of DCLK). DB[17:0] (or DB[15:0]) can be 0(low) or 1(high).These lines are read by \na rising edge of the DOT CLK signal. In RGB interface modes, the input display data is written \nto GRAM first then outputs the corresponding source voltage according to the gray data from \nGRAM. \n \n  \n\n \nRFI350U-AYW-DNG  \n \nPage 27 , Total 38  Pages \n10.5.2 RGB Interface Timing \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \nRFI350U-AYW-DNG  \n \nPage 28 , Total 38  Pages \n \n  Figure 13: RGB Interface Timing Diagram \n \n \n \n  \n\n \nRFI350U-AYW-DNG  \n \nPage 29 , Total 38  Pages \n10.6. Reset Timing  \n \nTable 2: Reset Timing \n \nNotes: \n1. The reset cancel also includes the required time for loading ID bytes, VCOM setting and \nother settings from the EEPROM to registers. After a rising edge of RESET, this loading is \ndone within 5 ms after the H/W reset cancel (tRT). \n2. According to the Table 3, a spike due to an electrostatic discharge on the RESET line does \nnot cause irregular system reset. \n \nTable 3 \n3. During the Reset period, the display will be blanked (When Reset starts in the Sleep Out \nmode, the display will enter the blanking sequence in at least 120 ms. The display remains \nthe blank state in the Sleep In mode.) and then return to the default condition for the \nHardware Reset. \n4. Spike Rejection can also be applied during a valid reset pulse, as shown below: \n \nFigure 14: Positive Noise Pulse during Reset Low \n5. When Reset is applied during the Sleep In Mode. \n6.
