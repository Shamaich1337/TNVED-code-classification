The LT1615 is designed for higher power systems\nwith a 350mA current limit and an input voltage range of1.2V to 15V, whereas the LT1615-1 is intended for lower\npower and single-cell applications with a 100mA current\nlimit and an extended input voltage range of 1V to 15V.Otherwise, the two devices are functionally equivalent.\nBoth devices feature a quiescent current of only 20 mA at no\nload, which further reduces to 0.5 mA in shutdown. A\ncurrent limited, fixed off-time control scheme conserves\noperating current, resulting in high efficiency over a broad\nrange of load current. The 36V switch allows high voltageoutputs up to 34V to be easily generated in a simple boost\ntopology without the use of costly transformers. The\nLT1615’s low off-time of 400ns permits the use of tiny, lowprofile inductors and capacitors to minimize footprint and\ncost in space-conscious portable applications.nLow Quiescent Current:\n20mA in Active Mode\n<1mA in Shutdown Mode\nnOperates with V IN as Low as 1V\nnLow V CESAT  Switch: 250mV at 300mA\nnUses Small Surface Mount Components\nnHigh Output Voltage: Up to 34V\nnLow Profile (1mm) ThinSOTTM Package\nnLCD Bias\nnHandheld Computers\nnBattery Backup\nnDigital Cameras\n, LTC and LT are registered trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.\n1-Cell Li-Ion to 20V Converter for LCD Bias\nVIN SW\nFBLT1615VIN\n2.5V TO 4.2VL1\n10µHD1\nSHDN\nR2\n130kR12M\nC2\n1µF20V\n12mA\nC1: TAIYO YUDEN LMK316BJ475\nC2: TAIYO YUDEN TMK316BJ105D1: MOTOROLA MBR0530L1: MURATA LQH3C100K241615/-1 TA01GND C14.7µFEfficiency\nLOAD CURRENT (mA)0.1 0.3EFFICIENCY (%)\n1 3 10 30\n1615 /-1 TA01a85\n80757065605550VIN = 4.2V\nVIN = 2.5VVIN = 3.3VAPPLICATIO SUFEATURES\nTYPICAL APPLICATIOUDESCRIPTIOU\nThinSOT is a trademark of Linear Technology Corporation.\n2LT1615/LT1615-1\n sn16151 16151fasABSOLUTE AXI U  RATI GSWWW UPACKAGE/ORDER I FOR ATIOUU W\n(Note 1)\nVIN, SHDN Voltage ................................................... 15V\nSW Voltage .............................................................. 36V\nFB Voltage .................................................................V IN\nCurrent into FB Pin ................................................. 1mA\nJunction Temperature........................................... 125 °C\nOperating Temperature Range (Note 2) .. –40 °C to 85°C\nStorage Temperature Range ................. –65 °C to 150°C\nLead Temperature (Soldering, 10 sec).................. 300 °CORDER PART\nNUMBER\nLT1615ES5\nLT1615ES5-1\nLT1615IS5\nLT1615IS5-1\nS5 PART MARKINGSW 1\nGND 2TOP VIEW\nS5 PACKAGE\n5-LEAD PLASTIC SOT-23FB 35 VIN\n4 SHDN\nELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS The l denotes the specifications which apply over the full operating\nPARAMETER CONDITIONS MIN TYP MAX UNITS\nMinimum Input Voltage LT1615-1 1.0 V\nLT1615 1.2 V\nQuiescent Current Not Switching 20 30 mA\nVSHDN = 0V 1 mA\nFB Comparator Trip Point l 1.205 1.23 1.255 V\nFB Comparator Hysteresis 8m V\nOutput Voltage Line Regulation 1.2V < V IN < 12V 0.05 0.1 %/V\nFB Pin Bias Current (Note 3) V FB = 1.23V l 30 80 nA\nSwitch Off Time V FB > 1V 400 ns\nVFB < 0.6V 1.5 ms\nSwitch V CESAT ISW = 70mA (LT1615-1) 85 120 mV\nISW = 300mA (LT1615) 250 350 mV\nSwitch Current Limit LT1615-1 75 100 125 mA\nLT1615 300 350 400 mA\nSHDN Pin Current V SHDN = 1.2V 2 3 mA\nVSHDN = 5V 8 12 mA\nSHDN Input Voltage High 0.9 V\nSHDN Input Voltage Low 0.25 V\nSwitch Leakage Current Switch Off, V SW = 5V 0.01 5 mA\nNote 1:  Absolute Maximum Ratings are those values beyond which the life\nof a device may be impaired.\nNote 2:  The LT1615E and LT1615E-1 are guaranteed to meet performance\nspecifications from 0 °C to 70°C.

Operation can be best understood by referring to\nthe block diagram in Figure 1. Q1 and Q2 along with R3 and\nR4 form a bandgap reference used to regulate the outputvoltage. When the voltage at the FB pin is slightly above\n1.23V, comparator A1 disables most of the internal cir-\ncuitry. Output current is then provided by capacitor C2,which slowly discharges until the voltage at the FB pin\ndrops below the lower hysteresis point of A1 (typical\nhysteresis at the FB pin is 8mV). A1 then enables theinternal circuitry, turns on power switch Q3, and the\ncurrent in inductor L1 begins ramping up. Once the switch\ncurrent reaches 350mA, comparator A2 resets the one-shot, which turns off Q3 for 400ns. L1 then delivers\ncurrent to the output through diode D1 as the inductor\ncurrent ramps down. Q3 turns on again and the inductorcurrent ramps back up to 350mA, then A2 resets the one-\nshot, again allowing L1 to deliver current to the output.This switching action continues until the output voltage is\ncharged up (until the FB pin reaches 1.23V), then A1 turns\noff the internal circuitry and the cycle repeats. The LT1615contains additional circuitry to provide protection during\nstart-up and under short-circuit conditions. When the FB\npin voltage is less than approximately 600mV, the switchoff-time is increased to 1.5 ms and the current limit is\nreduced to around 250mA (70% of its normal value). This\nreduces the average inductor current and helps minimizethe power dissipation in the LT1615 power switch and in\nthe external inductor and diode. The LT1615-1 operates in\nthe same manner, except the switch current is limited to100mA (the A2 reference voltage is 12mV instead of\n42mV).\n5LT1615/LT1615-1\n sn16151 16151fasChoosing an Inductor\nSeveral recommended inductors that work well with the\nLT1615 and LT1615-1 are listed in Table 1, although there\nare many other manufacturers and devices that can beused. Consult each manufacturer for more detailed infor-\nmation and for their entire selection of related parts. Many\ndifferent sizes and shapes are available. Use the equationsand recommendations in the next few sections to find the\ncorrect inductance value for your design.\nTable 1.

Thisvalue provides a good tradeoff in inductor size and system\nperformance. Pick a standard inductor close to this value.\nA larger value can be used to slightly increase the availableoutput current, but limit it to around twice the value\ncalculated below, as too large of an inductance will in-\ncrease the output voltage ripple without providing muchadditional output current. A smaller value can be used\n(especially for systems with output voltages greater than\n12V) to give a smaller physical size. Inductance can becalculated as:\nLVV V\nItOUT IN MIN D\nLIMOFF =-+()\nwhere V D = 0.4V (Schottky diode voltage), I LIM = 350mA or\n100mA, and t OFF = 400ns; for designs with varying V IN\nsuch as battery powered applications, use the minimumAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\nVIN value in the above equation. For most systems with\noutput voltages below 7V, a 4.7 mH inductor is the best\nchoice, even though the equation above might specify a\nsmaller value. This is due to the inductor current over-shoot that occurs when very small inductor values are\nused (see Current Limit Overshoot section).\nFor higher output voltages, the formula above will give\nlarge inductance values. For a 2V to 20V converter (typical\nLCD Bias application), a 21 mH inductor is called for with\nthe above equation, but a 10 mH inductor could be used\nwithout excessive reduction in maximum output current.\nInductor Selection—SEPIC Regulator\nThe formula below calculates the approximate inductor\nvalue to be used for a SEPIC regulator using the LT1615.\nAs for the boost inductor selection, a larger or smaller\nvalue can be used.\nLVV\nItOUT D\nLIMOFF =+æ\nŁçö\nł÷2\nCurrent Limit Overshoot\nFor the constant off-time control scheme of the LT1615,\nthe power switch is turned off only after the 350mA (or100mA) current limit is reached. There is a 100ns delay\nbetween the time when the current limit is reached and\nwhen the switch actually turns off. During this delay, theinductor current exceeds the current limit by a small\namount. The peak inductor current can be calculated by:\nIIVV\nLns PEAK LIMIN MAX SAT=+- æ\nŁçö\nł÷()100\nWhere V SAT = 0.25V (switch saturation voltage). The\ncurrent overshoot will be most evident for systems with\nhigh input voltages and for systems where smaller induc-\ntor values are used. This overshoot can be beneficial as ithelps increase the amount of available output current for\nsmaller inductor values. This will be the peak current seen\nby the inductor (and the diode) during normal operation.For designs using small inductance values (especially at\n6LT1615/LT1615-1\n sn16151 16151fasAPPLICATIO S I FOR ATIOWU U U\ninput voltages greater than 5V), the current limit over-\nshoot can be quite high. Although it is internally current\nlimited to 350mA, the power switch of the LT1615 can\nhandle larger currents without problem, but the overallefficiency will suffer. Best results will be obtained when\nI\nPEAK is kept below 700mA for the LT1615 and below\n400mA for the LT1615-1.\nCapacitor Selection\nLow ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) capacitors should\nbe used at the output to minimize the output ripple voltage.Multilayer ceramic capacitors are the best choice, as they\nhave a very low ESR and are available in very small\npackages. Their small size makes them a good companionto the LT1615’s SOT-23 package. Solid tantalum capaci-\ntors (like the AVX TPS, Sprague 593D families) or OS-CON\ncapacitors can be used, but they will occupy more boardarea than a ceramic and will have a higher ESR. Always use\na capacitor with a sufficient voltage rating.\nCeramic capacitors also make a good choice for the input\ndecoupling capacitor, which should be placed as close as\npossible to the LT1615. A 4.7 mF input capacitor is suffi-\ncient for most applications. Table 2 shows a list of severalcapacitor manufacturers. Consult the manufacturers for\nmore detailed information and for their entire selection of\nrelated parts.Diode Selection\nFor most LT1615 applications, the Motorola MBR0520\nsurface mount Schottky diode (0.5A, 20V) is an ideal\nchoice. Schottky diodes, with their low forward voltagedrop and fast switching speed, are the best match for the\nLT1615. For higher output voltage applications the 30V\nMBR0530 can be used. Many different manufacturersmake equivalent parts, but make sure that the component\nis rated to handle at least 0.35A. For LT1615-1 applica-\ntions, a Philips BAT54 or Central Semiconductor CMDSH-3works well.\nLowering Output Voltage Ripple\nUsing low ESR capacitors will help minimize the output\nripple voltage, but proper selection of the inductor and the\noutput capacitor also plays a big role. The LT1615 pro-\nvides energy to the load in bursts by ramping up theinductor current, then delivering that current to the load.\nIf too large of an inductor value or too small of a capacitor\nvalue is used, the output ripple voltage will increasebecause the capacitor will be slightly overcharged each\nburst cycle. To reduce the output ripple, increase the\noutput capacitor value or add a 4.7pF feed-forward capaci-tor in the feedback network of the LT1615 (see the circuits\nin the Typical Applications section). Adding this small,\ninexpensive 4.7pF capacitor will greatly reduce the outputvoltage ripple.\nTable 2.
