E | Page 4  of 64 GENERAL DE SCRIPTION \nThe AD9910 is a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) fe aturing  \nan integrated 14 -bit DAC and supporting sample rates up to \n1 GSPS. The AD9910 employs an a dvanced, proprietary DDS \ntechnology that provides a significant reduction in power co n-\nsumption with out sacrificing performance. The DDS/DAC \ncombination forms a digitally programmable, high frequency, \nanalog output sy nthesizer capable of generating a frequency  \nagile sinusoidal waveform at frequencies up to 400 MHz.  \nThe user has access to the three signa l control parameters that  \ncontrol the DDS: frequency, phase , and amplitude. The DDS \nprovides fast frequency hopping and frequency tu ning resolu -\ntion with its 32 -bit accumulator. With a 1  GSPS sample rate, the \ntuning resolution is ~0.23 Hz. The DDS also ena bles fast phase \nand am plitude switching capability.  The AD9910 is controlled by pro gramming its internal control \nregisters via a serial I/O port. The AD9910 includes an int egrated  \nstatic RAM to support various combinati ons of fre quency, phase , \nand/or amplitude modulation. The AD9910 also supports a user \ndefined, dig itally controlled, digital ramp  mode of operation. In \nthis mode , the  frequency, phase , or amplitude can be varied \nlinearly over time. F or more advanced modulation fun ctions, a \nhigh speed  parallel data input port is included to enable direct \nfrequency, phase, amplitude, or polar modula tion.  \nThe AD9910 is specified to operate over the extended i ndustrial \ntemperature range (see the Absolute Maximum Ra tings section  \nfor details ). \n06479-00216\nPARALLE L\nINPUT\nPDCLKSCLKSDIO\nI/O_RESET\nPROFILE[2:0]\nI/O_UPD ATERAM\nPOWER-\nDOWN\nCONTRO LEXT_PWR_DWNDAC_RSET\nIOUT\nIOUTCS\nTxENABLEDAC FSC\nOSKRAM_SWP_OVR\nA\nθINVERSE\nSINC\nFILTER\nCLOCKAMPLITUDE (A)\nFREQUENC Y (ω)PHASE (θ)\nDIGITAL\nRAM P\nGENER ATOR8\nDAC FSC82 DRCT L\nDRHOLD\nDROVER\n2\nMULTICHI P\nSYNCHRONIZ ATIONSYSCLK\nPLL÷2\nCLOCK MODEREF_CLK\nREF_CLKREFCLK_OUT\nXTAL_SE L\nPARALLE L DATA\nTIMING AND\nCONTRO LSERIA L I/O PORT2AD9910\nPROGRAMMING\nREGISTERSOUTPUT\nSHIFT\nKEYING\nDATA\nROUTE\nAND\nPARTITION\nCONTROL\n3\nINTERNAL CLOCK TIMING\nAND CONTROLωAcos (ωt + θ)\nAsin (ωt + θ)\nSYNC_SMP_ERRSYNC_CLK\nSYNC_OUT\nSYNC_IN\nPLL_LOCK\nPLL_LOOP_FI LTER\nMASTER_RESET2\n2DAC\n14-BITDDSAUX\nDAC\n8-BIT\n \nFigure 2.

If the reference clock multiplier is us ed to multiply the external refer ence clock frequency, \nthe SYSCLK frequency is the external frequency multiplied by the reference clock multiplication factor.

E | Page 16 of 64 THEORY OF OPERATION \n• The AD9910 has four modes of operation . \n• Single  tone  \n• RAM modulation  \n• Digital ramp modulation  \n• Parallel data port modulation  \nThe modes relate to the data source u sed to supply the DDS \nwith  its signal control parameters: frequency, phase,  or ampli -\ntude. The partitio ning of the data into different combinations  \nof frequency, phase, and amplitude is handled automatically \nbased on the mode and/or specific control bits.   \nIn single tone  mode, the DDS signal control parameters come \ndirectly f rom the programming registers  associated with the \nserial I/O p ort. In RAM modulation mode, the DDS signal \ncontrol parameters are stored in the internal  RAM  and played \nback upon command. In digital ramp modulation mode, the \nDDS  signal control parameters are delivered by  a dig ital ramp \ngenerator. In parallel data port modulation mode, the DDS \nsignal control parameters are driven directly into the parallel port.  \nThe various modulation mode s generally operate on only one of \nthe DDS signal control parameters (two in the case of the po lar \nmodulation format). The un modulated DDS signal control \nparameters are stored in their appropriate programming registers and  automatically route to the DDS ba sed on the \nselected mode.  A separate output shift keying (OSK) function is also available. This function employs a separate digital linear ramp generator that only affects the ampl itude parameter  of the DDS. The OSK \nfunction has priority over the other dat a sources that can drive \nthe DDS amplitude parameter . As such, no other data source \ncan drive the DDS amplitude when the OSK function is enabled.  \nAlthough the various modes (including the OSK function) are \ndescribed independently, they can be enabled simul taneously. \nThis provides an unprecedented level of flexibility for generating  \ncomplex mo dulation schemes. However, to avoid multiple data \nsources from driving the same DDS signal control parameter, \nthe device has a built -in prior ity protocol (see Table 5 in the \nMode Priority  section).  \nSINGLE TONE  MODE  \nIn single tone  mode, the DDS signal control p arameters are \nsupplied directly from the programming regi sters. A profile is \nan independent register that contai ns the DDS signal control \nparameters. Eight p rofile registers are available.  \nEach profile  is independently  accessible . Use the t hree external \nprofile  pins (PROFILE [2:0]) to select the desired profile. A \nchange in the state of the profile pins with the next  rising edge \non SY NC_CLK  updates the DDS with the parameters specified \nby the s elected profile.  \n06479-00516\nPARALLE L\nINPUT\nPDCLKSCLKSDIO\nI/O_RESET\nPROFILE[2:0]\nI/O_UPD ATERAM\nPOWER-\nDOWN\nCONTRO LEXT_PWR_DWNDAC_RSET\nIOUT\nIOUTCS\nTxENABLEDAC FSC\nOSKA\nθINVERSE\nSINC\nFILTER\nCLOCKAMPLITUDE (A)\nFREQUENC Y (ω)PHASE (θ)\nDIGITAL\nRAM P\nGENER ATOR8\nDAC FSC82\n2\nMUL TICHI P\nSYNCHRONIZ ATIONSYSCLK\nPLL÷2\nCLOCK MODEREF_CLK\nREF_CLKREFCLK_OUT\nXTAL_SE L\nPARALLE L DATA\nTIMING AND\nCONTRO LSERIA L I/O PORT2AD9910\nPROGRAMMING\nREGISTERSOUTPUT\nSHIFT\nKEYING\nDATA\nROUTE\nAND\nPARTITION\nCONTROL\n3\nINTERNAL CLOCK TIMING\nAND CONTROLωAcos (ωt + θ)\nAsin (ωt + θ)\nSYNC_SMP_ERR\nSYNC_OUT\nSYNC_IN\nPLL_LOCK\nPLL_LOOP_FI LTER\nMASTER_RESET2\n2AUX\nDAC\n8-BIT\nDAC\n14-BITDDSRAM_SWP_OVR\nDRCT L\nDRHOLD\nDROVER\nSYNC_CLK\n \nFigure 22. Single Tone Mode  \nData Sheet  AD9910  \n \nRev. E | Page 17 of 64 RAM MODULATION MODE  \nThe RAM modulation mode (see Figure 23) is activ ated via the \nRAM enable bit and assertion of the I/O_ UPDATE  pin (or a \nprofile change). In this mode , the modulated DDS signal  control \nparame ters are supplied d irectly from RAM.  \nThe RAM consists of 32 -bit words and is 1024 words deep. \nCoupled with a s ophisticated i nternal state machine, the RAM \nprovides a very flexible method for generating arbitrary, time \ndependent waveforms. A programmable timer controls the rate at which words are extracted from the RAM for delivery to the DDS. Thus, the programmable timer establishes a sa mple rate at \nwhich 32 -bit samples are supplied to the DDS.  The selection of the specific DDS signal control parameters  that \nserve as  the destin ation for the RAM samples is also programmable  \nthrough  eight independent RAM profile registers. Select a par-\nticular pr ofile using  the three external profile  pins (PROFILE [2:0]). \nA change in the state of the profile  pins with the next rising \nedge on  SYNC_CLK  activates the s elected RAM profile.  \nIn RAM modulation mode, the ability to generate a time  depen -\ndent amplitude, phase, or frequency signal enables mod ulation \nof any one of the parameters controlling the DDS carrier signal. Furthermore , a polar modulation format is available that  partitions  \neach RAM sa mple into a magnitude and phase component; 16 bits \nare allocated to phase and 14 bits are allocated to magn itude.  \n \n06479-00616\nPARALLE L\nINPUT\nPDCLKSCLKSDIO\nI/O_RESET\nPROFILE[2:0]\nI/O_UPD ATERAM\nEXT_PWR_DWNDAC_RSET\nIOUT\nIOUTCS\nTxENABLEDAC FSC\nOSKA\nθINVERSE\nSINC\nFILTER\nCLOCKAMPLITUDE (A)\nFREQUENC Y (ω)PHASE (θ)\nDIGITAL\nRAM P\nGENER ATOR8\nDAC FSC82\n2\nMULTICHI P\nSYNCHRONIZ ATIONSYSCLK\nPLL÷2\nCLOCK MODEREF_CLK\nREF_CLKREFCLK_OUT\nXTAL_SE L\nPARALLE L DATA\nTIMING AND\nCONTRO LSERIA L I/O PORT2AD9910\nPROGRAMMING\nREGISTERSOUTPUT\nSHIFT\nKEYING\nDATA\nROUTE\nAND\nPARTITION\nCONTROL\n3\nINTERNAL CLOCK TIMING\nAND CONTROLωAcos (ωt + θ)\nAsin (ωt + θ)\nSYNC_SMP_ERR\nSYNC_OUT\nSYNC_IN\nPLL_LOCK\nPLL_LOOP_FI LTER\nMASTER_RESET2\n2DDSAUX\nDAC\n8-BIT\nDAC\n14-BITRAM_SWP_OVR\nDRCT L\nDRHOLD\nDROVER\nSYNC_CLKPOWER-\nDOWN\nCONTRO L\n \nFigure 23.

E | Page 18 of 64 DIGITAL RAMP MODULAT ION MODE  \nIn digital ramp modulation mode ( see Figure 24), the  modulated \nDDS signal cont rol parameter is supplied directly from the  \ndigital ramp generator  (DRG). The ramp generation parameters \nare co ntrolled through  the serial I/O port.  \nThe ramp generation parameters allow the user to control both \nthe rising and falling slopes of the ramp. Th e upper and lower \nboundaries of the ramp, the step size and step rate of the rising \nportion of the ramp, and the step size and step rate of the falling portion of the ramp are all programmable.  The ramp is dig itally generated  with 32 -bit output resolution.  \nThe 32 -bit output of the DRG can be programmed to repr esent \nfrequency,  phase, or amplitude. When programmed to represent  \nfrequency , all 32 bits are used. However, when pr ogrammed to \nrepresent phase or amplitude, only the 16 MSBs or 14 MSB s, \nrespectively, are used.  \nThe ramp d irection (rising  or falling) is externally controlled by \nthe DRCTL  pin. An additional pin ( DRHOLD) allows the user \nto suspend  the ramp generator in  its pr esent state.  \n06479-00716\nPARALLE L\nINPUT\nPDCLKSCLKSDIO\nI/O_RESET\nPROFILE[2:0]\nI/O_UPD ATERAM\nEXT_PWR_DWNDAC_RSET\nIOUT\nIOUTCS\nTxENABLEDAC FSC\nOSKA\nθINVERSE\nSINC\nFILTER\nCLOCKAMPLITUDE (A)\nFREQUENC Y (ω)PHASE (θ)\nDIGITAL\nRAM P\nGENER ATOR8\nDAC FSC82\n2\nMUL TICHI P\nSYNCHRONIZ ATIONSYSCLK\nPLL÷2\nCLOCK MODEREF_CLK\nREF_CLKREFCLK_OUT\nXTAL_SE L\nPARALLE L DATA\nTIMING AND\nCONTRO LSERIA L I/O PORT2AD9910\nPROGRAMMING\nREGISTERSOUTPUT\nSHIFT\nKEYING\nDATA\nROUTE\nAND\nPARTITION\nCONTROL\n3\nINTERNAL CLOCK TIMING\nAND CONTROLωAcos (ωt + θ)\nAsin (ωt + θ)\nSYNC_SMP_ERR\nSYNC_OUT\nSYNC_IN\nPLL_LOCK\nPLL_LOOP_FI LTER\nMASTER_RESET2\n2DDSAUX\nDAC\n8-BIT\nDAC\n14-BITRAM_SWP_OVR\nDRCT L\nDRHOLD\nDROVER\nSYNC_CLKPOWER-\nDOWN\nCONTRO L\n \nFigure 24. Digital Ramp Modulation Mode  \n \nData Sheet AD9910\n \nRev. E | Page 19 of 64 PARALLEL DATA PORT MODULATION MODE \nIn parallel data port modulation mode (see Figure 25), the \nmodulated DDS signal control parameter(s) are supplied \ndirectly from the 18-bit parallel data port. \nThe data port is partitioned into two sections. The 16 MSBs make \nup a 16-bit data-word (D[15:0] pins) and the two LSBs make up \na 2-bit destination word (F[1:0] pins). The destination word defines how the 16-bit data-word is applied to the DDS signal control parameters. Table 4 defines the relationship between the \ndestination bits, the partitioning of the 16-bit data-word, and \nthe destination of the data (in terms of the DDS signal control parameters). Formatting of the 16-bit data-word is unsigned \nbinary, regardless of the destination. \nWhen the destination bits indicate that the data-word is destined \nas a DDS frequency parameter, the 16-bit data-word serves as \nan offset to the 32-bit frequency tuning word in the FTW regis-ter. This means that the 16-bit data-word must somehow be properly aligned with the 32-bit word in the FTW register. This \nis accomplished by means of the 4-bit FM gain word in the \nprogramming registers. The FM gain word allows the user to apply a weighting factor to the 16-bit data-word. In the default state (0), the 16-bit data-word and the 32-bit word in the FTW register are LSB aligned. Each increment in the value of the FM gain word shifts the 16-bit data-word to the left relative to the \n32-bit word in the FTW register, increasing the influence of the \n16-bit data-word on the frequency defined by the FTW register by a factor of two. The FM gain word effectively controls the \nfrequency range spanned by the data-word. \nParallel Data Clock (PDCLK) \nThe AD9910 generates a clock signal on the PDCLK pin that \nruns at ¼ of the DAC sample rate (the sample rate of the par-\nallel data port). PDCLK serves as a data clock for the parallel port. By default, each rising edge of PDCLK is used to latch the 18 bits of user-supplied data into the data port. The edge polarity can be changed through the PDCLK invert bit. Furthermore, \nthe PDCLK output signal can be switched off using the PDCLK \nenable bit.

By \ndefault, TxENABLE is considered true for Logic 1 and false for Logic 0. However, the logical behavior of this pin can be reversed using the TxENABLE invert bit. When TxENABLE is true, the \ndevice latches data into the device on the expected edge of PDCLK \n(based on the PDCLK invert bit). When TxENABLE is false, even though the PDCLK may continue to operate, the device ignores the data supplied to the port. Furthermore, when the TxENABLE pin is held false, the device internally clears the  \n16-bit data-words, or it retains the last value present on the data \nport prior to TxENABLE switching to the false state (based on \nthe setting of the data assembler hold last value bit). Alternatively, instead of operating the TxENABLE pin as a gate, \nthe user can drive the TxENABLE pin with a clock signal operating at the parallel port data rate. When driven by a clock \nsignal, the transition from the false to true state must meet the \nrequired setup and hold time on each cycle to ensure proper operation.

E | Page 21 of 64 MODE PRIORITY  \nThe three different modulation modes generate frequency, \nphase, and/or amplitude data destined for the DDS signal \ncontrol parameters. In addition, the OSK function generates \namplitude data destined for the DDS. Each of these functions is independently invoked using the a ppropriate control bit via the \nserial I/O p ort. \nThe ability to activate each of these functions ind ependently \nmakes it possible to have multiple data sources attemp ting to drive the same DDS signal control parameter. To avoid  contention, \nthe AD9910 has a built -in priority system.  Table 5 summarizes \nthe priority for each of the DDS signal co ntrol parameters. The \nrows of Table 5 list data sources for a particular  DDS signal con -\ntrol parameter in descending order of precedence. For example, if both the RAM and the parallel port are enabled and both are \nprogrammed for frequency as the destination, then the DDS \nfrequency parameter is driven by the RAM and not the parallel \ndata p ort. \nTable 5.

DDS Block Diag ram  \nThe output frequenc y (f OUT) of the AD9910 is controlled by the \nfrequency tuning word (FTW) at the frequency control input to \nthe DDS. The relationship among  fOUT, FTW , and f SYSCLK  is given  by \nSYSCLK OUT fFTWf \uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb=322 (1) \nwhere FTW  is a 32 -bit integer ranging in value from 0 to \n2,147,483,647 (231 − 1), which represents the lower half of the \nfull 32 -bit range . This range constitutes frequencies from dc  to \nNyquist ( that is , ½ fSYSCLK ). \nThe FTW required to generate a desired value of f OUT is found \nby solving E quation 1 for FTW , as given in Equation 2 . \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb=\nSYSCLKOUT\nffFTW322 round  (2) \nwhere t he round( x) function round s the argument (the value of \nx) to the nearest integer. This is required because the FTW is \nconstrained  to be an integer value. For exa mple, for f OUT = \n41 MHz and f SYSCLK  = 122.88 MHz, then FTW = 1,433,053,867 \n(0x556AAAAB).  \nProgramming an FTW greater than 231 produces an aliased \nimage that appears at a fr equency given by  \nSYSCLK OUT fFTWf \uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb−=3221  (for FTW ≥ 231) \nThe relative phase of the DDS signal can be digitally controlled \nby means of a 1 6-bit phase offset word (POW). The phase offset \nis applied prior to t he angle -to-amplitude conversion b lock \ninternal to the DDS core. The relative phase offset  (Δθ) is given by  \uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb\n=\n1616\n236022\nΔPOWPOWπ\nθ  \nwhere the upper quantity is for the phase offset expressed as \nradian units and the lower quantity as degrees. To find the  POW \nvalue necessary to develop an arbitrary Δ θ, solve the previous  \nequation for POW and round the result (in a manner similar  \nto that described previously for finding an arbitrary FTW).  \nThe relative amplitude of the DDS signal can be digitally scaled \n(relat ive to full scale)  by means of a 14 -bit amplitude scale \nfactor (ASF). The amplitude scale value is applied at the output of the angle -to-amplitude conversion block internal to the DDS \ncore. The amplitude scale is given by  \n\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb=\n1414\n2log202\nASFASF\nScale Amplitude  (3) \nwhere the upper quantity is amplitude expressed as a fraction of \nfull scale and the lower quantity is expressed in  decibels relative \nto full scale . To find the ASF  value necessary for a particular \nscale factor , solve E quation 3 for ASF and round the result (in  \na manner similar to that described  previously  for finding an \narbitrary FTW).  \nWhen the AD9910 is programmed to modulate any of the DDS \nsignal control parameters, the maximum modulation sa mple \nrate is ¼ f SYSCLK . This means that the modulation signal exhibit s \nimages at multiples of ¼ f SYSCLK . The impact of these images \nmust be considered wh en using the device as a modulator.  \n14-BIT DAC OUTPUT  \nThe AD9910 incorporates an in tegrated 14 -bit, current  output \nDAC. The output current is delivered as a balanced signal u sing \ntwo outputs. The use of balanced outputs reduces the pote ntial \namount of common -mode noise present at the DAC output, \noffering the adva ntage of an increased sig nal-to-noise ratio. An \nexternal resistor (R SET) connected b etween the DAC_RSET  pin \nand AGND establishes the reference current. The full -scale \noutput current of the DAC (I OUT) is pr oduced as a scaled version \nof the reference current (see the Auxiliary DAC  section). The \nrecommended value of R SET is 10  kΩ. \nAttention should be paid to the load termination to keep the \noutput voltage within the specified compliance range; voltages developed beyond this range cause excessive distortion and can \ndamage the DAC output circuitry.  \nData Sheet  AD9910  \n \nRev. E | Page 23 of 64 Auxiliary DAC  \nAn 8 -bit auxiliary DAC controls t he full -scale output current of \nthe main DAC (I OUT). An 8 -bit code word stored in the  appropr iate \nregister map location sets I OUT according to the following  equation:  \n\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb+=9614.86 CODE\nRI\nSETOUT  \nwhere RSET is the value of the R SET resistor (in oh ms) and CODE \nis the 8 -bit value supplied to the auxiliary DAC (default is 127). \nFor example, with R SET = 10,000 Ω and CODE  = 127, then I OUT = \n20.07 mA.  \nINVERSE S INC  FILTER  \nThe sampled carrier data stream is the input to the digital -to-\nanalog converter (DAC) integrated i nto the AD9910. The  \nDAC output spectrum is shaped by the characteristic sin(x)/x \n(or sinc) envelope, due to the intri nsic zero -order hold effect \nassociated with DAC  generated signa ls. The sinc envelope  \ncan be compensated for because its shape is well known. This \nenvelope restor ation function is provided by the i nverse sinc \nfilter preceding the DAC.  The inverse sinc filter is implemented   \nas a digital FIR filter. It has a response c haracteristic that very \nnearly matches the i nverse of the sinc  envelope. The response  \nof the  inverse sinc filter is shown in Figure 28 (with the sinc  \nenvelope for co mparison).  \nThe inverse sinc filter is enabled using  CFR1[22] . The filter tap \ncoefficients are given in  Table 6. The filter operates by  distorting \nthe data prior to its arrival at the DAC in such a way as to \ncompensate for the sinc  envelope that ot herwise distort s the \nspectrum.  \nWhen the inverse  sinc filter is enabled , it introduces a  ~3.0  dB \ninsertion loss.  The inverse sinc compensation is effective for  output \nfrequencies up to a pproximately 40% of the DAC sample rate.  \nTable 6.

Without the i nverse sinc filter, the  \nDAC ou tput suffers from the frequency dependent droop of  \nthe sinc envelope. The i nverse sinc filter effectively flattens the \ndroop to within ± 0.05 dB, as shown in Figure 29, which shows  \nthe corrected sinc  response with the i nver se sinc filter enabled.  1\n0\n–1\n–2\n–3\n–4\n0 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.5\n06479-011(dB)\nFREQUENCY RELATIVE TO DAC SAMPLE RATEINVERSE\nSINCSINC\n \nFigure 28.

The REF _CLK input can be \ndriven directly from a differential or single -ended source, or it \ncan accept a crystal connected across the two input pins. There \nis als o an internal phase -locked loop (PLL) multiplier that can \nbe independently enabled. A block diagram of the REF _CLK \nfunctionality is shown in Figure 30. The various input configu -\nrations are controlled by the  XTAL_SEL pin and the control bits \nin the CFR3 register. Figure 30 also shows how the CFR3  control \nbits are ass ociated with specific functional blocks.  \nAD9910  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

When the direct input path is selected ,  \nthe REF_CLK/ REF_CLK  pins must be driven by an external \nsignal source (si ngle-ended or differential). Input frequencies \nup to 2  GHz are supported. For inpu t frequencies greater than  \n1 GHz, the input divider must be enabled for proper oper ation \nof the device.  \nWhen the PLL is enabled, a buffered clock signal is available at \nthe REFCLK_OUT pin. This clock signal is the same fr equency \nas the REF _CLK input. This  is especially useful when a crystal \nis connected because it gives the user a replica of the crystal clock for dri ving other externa l devices. The REFCLK_OUT has \nprogrammable drive capability. This is controlled by two bits , as \nlisted in Table 7. \nTable 7.

Crystal  Connection Diagram  \nDirect Driven REF _CLK /REF_CLK  \nWhen driving the REF_CLK/ REF_CLK  inputs directly from a \nsignal source , either single -ended or differential signals can  be \nused. With a dif ferential signal source, the REF_CLK/ REF_CLK  \npins are driven with co mplementary signals and ac-coupled  with \n0.1 µF capacitors. With a single -ended signa l source, either a \nsingle -ended -to-differential co nversion can be employed or the \nREF _CLK input can be driven single -ended directly. In either \ncase, 0.1  µF capac itors are used to ac  couple both  REF_CLK/  \nREF_CLK  pins to avoid distur bing the internal dc  bias voltage \nof ~1.35 V . See Figure 32 for more details . \nThe REF_CLK/ REF_CLK  input resistance is ~2.5  kΩ differential \n(~1.2  kΩ single -ended). Most signal sourc es have relativel y low \noutput impedances.

The PLL supports a wide range of \nprogrammable frequency multiplic ation factors (12× to 127×) \nData Sheet AD9910\n \nRev. E | Page 25 of 64 as well as a programmable charge pump current and external \nloop filter components (connected via the PLL_LOOP_FILTER pin). These features add an extra layer of flexibility to the PLL, allowing optimization of phase noise performance and \nflexibility in frequency plan development. The PLL is also \nequipped with a PLL_LOCK pin. \nThe PLL output frequency range (f\nSYSCLK ) is constrained to the \nrange of 420 MHz ≤ f SYSCLK  ≤ 1 GHz by the internal VCO. In \naddition, the user must program the VCO to one of six operating \nranges such that f SYSCLK  falls within the specified range. Figure 33 \nand Figure 34 summarize these VCO ranges. \nFigure 33 shows the boundaries of the VCO frequency ranges \nover the full range of temperature and supply voltage variation \nfor all devices from the available population. The implication is that multiple devices chosen at random from the population and operated under widely varying conditions may require different values to be programmed into CFR3[26:24] to operate at the \nsame frequency. For example, Part A chosen randomly from the \npopulation, operating at an ambient temperature of −10°C with a system clock frequency of 900 MHz may require CFR3[26:24] to be set to 100b, whereas Part B chosen randomly from the population, operating at an ambient temperature of 90°C with a \nsystem clock frequency of 900 MHz may require CFR3[26:24] \nto be set to 101b. If a frequency plan is chosen such that the system clock frequency operates within one set of boundaries (as shown in Figure 33), the required value in CFR3[26:24] is \nconsistent from part to part. \nFigure 34 shows the boundaries of the VCO frequency ranges \nover the full range of temperature and supply voltage variation \nfor an individual device selected from the population. Figure 34 shows that the VCO frequency ranges for a single device always overlap when operated over the full range of conditions. \nIf a user wants to retain a sing le default value for CFR3[26:24],  \na frequency that falls into one of the ranges found in Figure 33 \nshould be selected. Additionally, for any given individual device, \nthe VCO frequency ranges overlap, meaning that any given device exhibits no gaps in its frequency coverage across VCO ranges over the full range of conditions. \n06479-059VCO0VCO1VCO2VCO3VCO4VCO5\n395 495 595 695 795 895 995fLOW = 400\nfHIGH = 460fLOW = 455\nfHIGH = 530fLOW = 530\nfHIGH = 615fLOW = 760\nfHIGH  = 875fLOW = 920\nfHIGH = 1030\nfLOW = 650\nfHIGH  = 790\n(MHz) \nFigure 33.

The PFD reset \nbit must be cleared for normal operation.  \nOUTPUT SHIFT KEYING ( OSK)  \nThe OSK function ( see Figure 36) allows the user to control the \noutput signal ampli tude of the DDS. Both a manual and an \nautomatic mode are  available under program control. The \namplitude data generated by the OSK block has priority over \nany other functional b lock that is programmed to deliver \namplitude data to the DDS. Therefore , the OSK data source, \nwhen enabled, over rides all other amplitude data sources.  \n06479-017OSK ENABLE\nAMPLITUDE SCALE FACTOR\n(ASF[15:2])AMPLITUDE RAMP RATE\n(ASF[31:16])\nAMPLITUDE STEP SIZE\n(ASF[1:0])MANUAL OSK EXTERNALAUTO OSK ENABLEOSK\nDDS CLOCKTO DDS\nAMPLITUDECONTROLPARAMETER60\nLOAD ARR AT I/O_UPDATE\nOSK\nCONTROLLER14\n16\n14\n2\n \nFigure 36. OSK Block Diagram  \nThe operation of the OSK function is governed by  two CFR1  \nregister bits  (OSK enable and  select aut o OSK) , the external \nOSK pin, and the entire 32 bits of the ASF register. The primary \ncontrol for the OSK block is the OSK Enable bit. When  the OSK \nfunction is disabled, the  OSK input controls are ignored a nd the \ninternal clocks shut down.  \nWhen the OSK function is enabled, automatic or manual \noper ation is selected using  the select auto OSK bit. A Logic 0 \nindicates manual mode (default).  \nManual OSK \nIn manual mode, output amplitude is varied by successive writ e \noperations to the amplitude scale facto r portion of the ASF \nregister. The rate at which amplitude changes can be applied to \nthe output signal is limited by the speed of the serial I/O port. \nIn manual mode, the OSK pin functionality depends on the \nstate o f the m anual OSK external control bit. When the OSK \npin is Logic 0 , the output amplitude is forced to 0 ; otherwise, \nthe output amplitude is set by the  amplitude scale factor value.  \nData Sheet AD9910\n \nRev. E | Page 27 of 64 Automatic OSK \nIn automatic mode, the OSK function automatically generates a \nlinear amplitude vs. time profile (or amplitude ramp). The ampli-\ntude ramp is controlled via three parameters: the maximum \namplitude scale factor, the amplitude step size, and the time interval between steps. The amplitude ramp parameters reside in the 32-bit ASF register and are programmed via the serial  I/O port. The time interval between amplitude steps is set via \nthe 16-bit amplitude ramp rate portion of the ASF register \n(Bits[31:16]). The maximum amplitude scale factor is set via the 14-bit amplitude scale factor in the ASF register (Bits[15:2]). The amplitude step size is set via the 2-bit amplitude step size portion of the ASF register (Bits[1:0]). Additionally, the \ndirection of the ramp (positive or negative slope) is controlled \nby the external OSK pin.  \nThe step interval is controlled by a 16-bit programmable timer \nthat is clocked at a rate of ¼ f\nSYSCLK . The period of the timer sets \nthe time interval between amplitude steps. The step time interval \n(Δt) is given by \nSYSCLKfMt4Δ\uf03d  \nwhere M is the 16-bit number stored in the amplitude ramp rate \n(ARR) portion of the ASF register. For example, if f SYSCLK  = \n750 MHz and M = 23218 (0x5AB2), then Δt ≈ 123.8293 μs. \nThe output of the OSK function is a 14-bit unsigned data bus \nthat controls the amplitude parameter of the DDS (as long as \nthe OSK enable bit is set). When the OSK pin is set, the OSK output value starts at 0 (zero) and increments by the pro-\ngrammed amplitude step size until it reaches the programmed \nmaximum amplitude value. When the OSK pin is cleared, the OSK output starts at its present value and decrements by the \nprogrammed amplitude step size until it reaches 0 (zero). \nThe OSK output does not necessarily attain the maximum \namplitude value if the OSK pin is switched to Logic 0 before the \nmaximum value is reached. Nor does the OSK output necessarily reach a value of 0 if the OSK pin is switched to Logic 1 before the 0 value is reached. \nThe OSK output is initialized to 0 (zero) at power-up and reset \nwhenever the OSK enable bit or the select auto OSK bit is cleared. \nThe amplitude step size of the OSK output is set by the amplitude \nstep size bits in the ASF register according to Table 10. The step \nsize refers to the LSB weight of the 14-bit OSK output. Regardless of the programmed step size, the OSK output does not exceed \nthe maximum amplitude value programmed into the ASF \nregister. Table 10. OSK Amplitude Step Size \nAmplitude Step Size Bits (ASF[1:0]) Amplitude Step Size \n00 1 \n01 2 \n10 4 \n11 8 \nAs mentioned previously, a 16-bit programmable timer controls \nthe step interval. Normally, this timer is loaded with the pro-\ngrammed timing value whenever the timer expires, initiating a \nnew timing cycle. However, there are three events that can cause \nreloading of the timer to have its timing value reloaded prior to the timer expiring. One such event occurs when the select auto OSK bit transitions from cleared to set, followed by an I/O update. A second such event is a change of state in the OSK pin. The third is dependent on the status of the load ARR @ I/O update \nbit. If this bit is cleared, then no action occurs; otherwise, when \nthe I/O_UPDATE pin is asserted (or a profile change occurs), \nthe timer is reset to its initial starting point. \nDIGITAL RAMP GENERATOR (DRG) \nDRG Overview \nT o sweep phase, frequency, or amplitude from a defined start \npoint to a defined endpoint, a completely digital, digital ramp \ngenerator is included in the AD9910. The DRG makes use of \nnine control register bits, three external pins, two 64-bit \nregisters, and one 32-bit register (see Figure 37). \nDIGITAL RAMP LIMIT REGISTER\nDRCTL\nDDS CLOCK\nDRHOLDDROVER\nDIGITAL RAMP RATE REGISTERDIGITAL RAMP STEP REGISTER\n06479-018TO DDS\nSIGNALCONTROL\nPARAMETERDIGITAL RAMP ENABLE\nDROVER PIN ACTIVE\nLOAD LRR AT I/O_UPDATE\nCLEAR DIGITAL\nRAMP ACCUMULATOR\nAUTOCLEAR DIGITAL\nRAMP ACCUMULATOR\n64\n64DIGITAL RAMP DESTINATION2\nDIGITAL RAMP NO-DWELL2\n3232DIGITAL\nRAMP\nGENERATOR62 61 63\n \nFigure 37.

E | Page 28 of 64 The primary control for the DRG is the digital ramp enable bit. \nWhen disabled, the other DRG input controls are ignored and the \ninternal clocks are shut down to conserve power. \nThe output of the DRG is a 32-bit unsigned data bus that can be \nrouted to any one of the three DDS signal control parameters, as \ncontrolled by the two digital ramp destination bits in Control Function Register 2 according to Table 11. The 32-bit output bus is MSB-aligned with the 32-bit frequency parameter, the 16-bit phase parameter, or the 14-bit amplitude parameter, as \ndefined by the destination bits. When the destination is phase \nor amplitude, the unused LSBs are ignored. \nTable 11.

The ramp characteristics of the DRG are fully programmable. This \nincludes the upper and lower ramp limits, and independent control \nof the step size and step rate for both the positive and negative slope \ncharacteristics of the ramp. A detailed block diagram of the DRG is \nshown in Figure 38. \nThe direction of the ramping function is controlled by the \nDRCTL pin. A Logic 0 on this pin causes the DRG to ramp  \nwith a negative slope, whereas a Logic 1 causes the DRG to \nramp with a positive slope. \nThe DRG also supports a hold feature controlled via the DRHOLD \npin. When this pin is set to Logic 1, the DRG is stalled at its last \nstate; otherwise, the DRG operates normally. \nThe DDS signal control parameters that are not the destination of \nthe DRG are taken from the active profile. \nDDS CLOCKDQ\nR\nLOWER\nLIMIT0\n1DECREMENT STEP SIZE\nPRESET\nQDRCTL\nLOADCLEAR DIGITAL RAMP ACCUMULATO R\nAUTOCLEAR DIGITAL RAMP ACC .NO DWELLLIMIT CONTROLDIGITAL RAMP ACCUMULATOR\nINCREMENT STEP SIZE32\n32\n01NEGATIVE SLOPE RATE\nPOSITIVE SLOPE RATE16\n1632\n1662\nDRHOLD 633232\nLOAD\nCONTROL\nLOGICLOAD LRR AT I/O_UPDATE\nDIGITAL\nRAMP\nTIMERACCUMULATOR\nRESET\nCONTROL\nLOGICNO-DWELL\nCONTROL232 32TO DDS\nSIGNAL\nCONTROLPARAMETER\nUPPER\nLIMIT32\n06479-019 \nFigure 38. Digital Ramp Generator Detail \n \nData Sheet  AD9910  \n \nRev. E | Page 29 of 64 DRG Slope Control  \nThe core of the DRG is a 32 -bit accumulator clocked by a \nprogrammable timer. The time  base for the timer is the DDS \nclock, which operates at ¼ f SYSCLK . The  timer establishes the \ninterval b etween successive updates of the accumulator. The \npositive (+ Δt) and negative ( −Δt) slope step intervals are \nindependently pr ogrammable as given by  \nSYSCLKfPt4Δ=+  \nSYSCLKfNt4Δ=−  \nwhere P and N are the two 1 6-bit values stored in the 32 -bit digital \nramp rate re gister and control the step interval.  N defines the step \ninterval of the negative slope portion of the ramp. P defines the step \ninterval of the pos itive slope portion of the ramp.  \nThe step size of the p ositive (STEP P) and negative (STEP N) slope \nportions of the ramp are 32-bit values programmed into the 64 -bit \ndigital ramp step size register. Program each of the  step size s as an \nunsigned integer  (the hardware automatically interprets STEP N as  \na negative value ). The relationship between the 32- bit step size  \nvalues and actual  units of frequency, phase , or amplitude  depend  \non the  digital ramp destination bits. Calculate t he actual fre quency, \nphase, or amplitude step size by substituting  STEP N or STEP P \nfor M in the following equ ations as required : \nSYSCLKfMStep Frequency \uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb=322 \n312MStep Phaseπ=   (radians)  \n29245MStep Phase =   (degrees)  \nFSIMStep Amplitude \uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb=322 \nNote that the frequency units are the same as those used to \nrepresent f SYSCLK  (MHz , for example). T he amplitude units are \nthe same as those used to rep resent  IFS, the full -scale output \ncurrent of the DAC  (mA, for example ). \nThe phase and amplitude step size equations yield the average step size. Although the step size accumulates with 32 -bit precision, \nthe phase or amplitude destination  exhibits only  16 or 14 bits, \nrespectively. Therefore , at the destination, the actual phase or \namplitude step is the accumulat ed 32- bit value truncated to 16 \nor 14 bits, respectively.  As describ ed previously , the step inte rval is controlled by a  \n16-bit pr ogrammable timer. There are three events that can \ncause this timer to be reloaded prior to its expira tion.  \nOne event occurs  when the d igital ramp enable bit transitions  \nfrom cleared to set , followed by an I/O u pdate. A second event \nis a change of state in the DRCTL  pin. The third event is enabled \nusing the  load LRR @ I/O update  bit (see the Register Map and Bit \nDescriptions  section  for details ).  \nDRG Limit Control  \nThe ramp accumulator is followed by limit control logic that \nenforces an upper and lower boundary on the output of the \nramp generator. Under no circumstances does the output of the \nDRG exceed the pr ogrammed limit values while the DRG is \nenabled. The limits are set through  the 64 -bit digit al ramp limit \nregister. Note that the upper limit value must be greater than the \nlower limit value to ensure normal operation.  \nDRG Accumulator Clear  \nThe ramp accumulator can be cleared ( that is , reset to 0) under \nprogram control. When the ramp accumulator is cleared, it forces \nthe DRG output to the lower limit programmed into the digital \nramp limit registe r. \nWith the limit control block embedded in the feedback path of the \naccumulator, resetting the accumulator is equivalent to pr esetting it \nto the lower li mit value.  \nNormal Ramp Generation  \nNormal ramp g eneration implies that both  no-dwell bits are \ncleared  (see the No-Dwell Ramp Generation  section  for details ). \nIn Figure 39, a sample ramp waveform is depicte d with the \nrequired control signals. The top trace is the DRG output.  \nThe next trace down is the status of the DROVER  output pin \n(assuming that the DROVER  pin active bit is set). The  remai ning \ntraces are control bits and control pins. The pertinent ramp \nparameters are also identified (upper and lower limits plus step \nsize and Δ t for the positive and negative slopes). A long the \nbottom, circled numbers identify specific events. These events \nare referred to by number (Event 1 and so on) in the following \nparagraphs.  \nIn this particular example, the positive and negative slopes of \nthe ramp are different to demonstrate the flexibility of the DRG. \nThe parameters of both slopes can be programmed to make the \npositive and neg ative slopes the same.  \nAD9910 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Normal Ramp Generation \nEvent 1—The digital ramp enable bit is set, which has no effect \non the DRG output because the bit is not effective until an I/O \nupdate. \nEvent 2—An I/O update registers the enable bit. If DRCTL = 1 \nis in effect at this time (the gray portion of the DRCTL trace), \nthen the DRG output immediately begins a positive slope (the gray portion of the DRG output trace). Otherwise, if DRCTL = \n0, the DRG output is initialized to the lower limit. \nEvent 3—DRCTL transitions to a Logic 1 to initiate a positive \nslope at the DRG output. In this example, the DRCTL pin is \nheld long enough to cause the DRG to reach its programmed upper limit. The DRG remains at the upper limit until the ramp \naccumulator is cleared, DRCTL = 0, or the upper limit is \nreprogrammed to a higher value. In the last case, the DRG \nimmediately resumes its previous positive slope profile. \nEvent 4—DRCTL transitions to a Logic 0 to initiate a negative \nslope at the DRG output. In this example, the DRCTL pin is \nheld long enough to cause the DRG to reach its programmed lower limit. The DRG remains at the lower limit until DRCTL = 1, or until the lower limit is reprogrammed to a lower value. In the latter case, the DRG immediately resumes its previous negative slope profile. \nEvent 5—DRCTL transitions to a Logic 1 for the second time, \ninitiating a second positive slope. \nEvent 6—The positive slope profile is interrupted by DRHOLD \ntransitioning to a Logic 1. This stalls the ramp accumulator and \nfreezes the DRG output at its last value. Event 7—DRHOLD transitions to a Logic 0, releasing the ramp \naccumulator and reinstating the previous positive slope profile. \nEvent 8—The clear digital ramp accumulator bit is set, which \nhas no effect on the DRG because the bit is not effective until an I/O update is issued. \nEvent 9—An I/O update registers that the clear digital ramp \naccumulator bit is set, resetting the ramp accumulator and \nforcing the DRG output to the programmed lower limit. The \nDRG output remains at the lower limit until the clear condition \nis removed. \nEvent 10—The clear digital ramp accumulator bit is cleared, \nwhich has no effect on the DRG output because the bit is not \neffective until an I/O update is issued. \nEvent 11—An I/O update registers that the clear digital ramp \naccumulator bit is cleared, releasing the ramp accumulator, and \nthe previous positive slope profile restarts. \nEvent 12—The autoclear digital ramp accumulator bit is set, \nwhich has no effect on the DRG output because the bit is not effective until an I/O update is issued. \nEvent 13—An I/O update registers that the autoclear digital \nramp accumulator bit is set, resetting the ramp accumulator. However, with an automatic clear, the ramp accumulator is only \nheld reset for a single DDS clock cycle. This forces the DRG output to the lower limit, but the ramp accumulator is immedi-ately made available for normal operation. In this example, the DRCTL pin remains a Logic 1; therefore, the DRG output \nrestarts the previous positive ramp profile. \nData Sheet  AD9910  \n \nRev. E | Page 31 of 64 No-Dwell Ramp Generation  \nThe two no-dwell  bits in Control Function Register 2 add to the \nflexibility of th e DRG  capabilities. During normal ramp generation, \nwhen the DRG ou tput reaches the programmed upper or lower \nlimit , it simply remains at the limit until the operating parameters \ndictate otherwise. However, d uring no -dwell operation , the DRG \noutput does not  nece ssarily remain at the limit. For example, if the \ndigital ramp no-dwell high bit is set  when the DRG reaches the \nupper limit,  it automatically (and immediately) snaps to the lower \nlimit ( that is , it does not ramp back to the lower limit ; it jumps to \nthe lower limit). Likewise, when the digital ramp no-dwell low bit is \nset, and the DRG reaches the lower limit , it automat ically (and \nimmediately) snaps to the upper limit.  \nDuring no -dwell operation , the DRCTL  pin is m onitored for state \ntransitions only ; that is, the s tatic logic level is immaterial . \nDuring no -dwell high operation, a positive transition of the \nDRCTL  pin initiates a positive slope ramp, which continues \nuninte rrupted (regardless of any further activity on the DRCTL  \npin) until the u pper limit is  reached.  \nDuring no -dwell low operation, a negative transition of the DRCTL  \npin initiates a negative slope ramp, which continues uninterrupted \n(regardless of any further activity on the DRCTL  pin) until the \nlower limit is reached.  \nSetting both no -dwell bit s invokes a continuous ramping mode \nof operation ; that is, the DRG output automatically oscillates \nbetween the two limits using the programmed slope parameters . \nFurthermore, the function of the DRCTL  pin is slightly different . \nInstead of controlling the in itiation of the ramp sequence, it \nonly serves to change the direction of the ramp ; that is, if the \nDRG output is in the midst of a pos itive slope and the DRCTL  \npin transitions from Logic  1 to Logic 0, then the DRG imme -\ndiately switch es to the negative slop e parameters and resume s \noscilla tion between the li mits. Likewise, if the DRG output is in \nthe midst of a negative slope and the DRCTL  pin transitions  from \nLogic 0  to Logic 1, the DRG imm ediately switch es to the positive \nslope parameters and resume s oscil lation between the limits.  \nWhen both no -dwell bits are set, the DROVER  signal pr oduce s a \npositive pulse (two cycles of the DDS clock) each time the DRG \noutput reaches either of the programmed limits (assu ming that the \nDROVER  pin active bit is set).  \nA no -dwell high DRG output waveform is shown in Figure 40. \nThe waveform diagram assumes that the d igital ramp no-dwell \nhigh bit is set  and has been registered by an I/O u pdate. The \nstatus of the DROVER  pin is also shown with the a ssumpti on \nthat the DROVER  pin active bit has been set.

Sp ecifically, when the DRG output is at either of the \nprogrammed limits, the DROVER  pin is Logic 1 ; otherwise, it is \nLogic 0 . In the special case of both no -dwell bits set, the DROVER  \npin pulses positive for two DDS c lock cycles each time the DRG \noutput reaches either of the programmed limits.  \nAD9910 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 32 of 64 RAM CONTROL \nRAM Overview \nThe AD9910 makes use of a 1024 × 32-bit RAM. The RAM has \ntwo fundamental modes of operation: data load/retrieve mode \nand playback mode. Data load/retrieve mode is active when the RAM data is being loaded or read back via the serial I/O port. Playback mode is active when the RAM enable contents are routed to one of the internal data destinations.  \nDepending on the specific playback mode, the user can \npartition the RAM with up to eight independent time domain \nwaveforms. These waveforms drive the DDS signal control \nparameters, allowing for frequency, phase, amplitude, or polar \nmodulated signals. \nRAM operations are enabled by setting the RAM enable bit in \nControl Function Register 1; an I/O update (or a profile change) \nis necessary to enact any change to the state of this bit.  \nWaveforms are generated using eight RAM profile control \nregisters that are accessed via the three profile pins. Each profile contains the following: \n\uf0b7 10-bit waveform start address word \n\uf0b7 10-bit waveform end address word \n\uf0b7 16-bit address step rate control word \n\uf0b7 3-bit RAM mode control word \n\uf0b7 No-dwell high bit \n\uf0b7 Zero-crossing bit \nThe user must ensure that the end address is greater than the \nstart address. \nEach profile defines the number of samples and the sample rate \nfor a given waveform. In conjunction with an internal state \nmachine, the RAM contents are delivered to the appropriate DDS signal control parameter(s) at the specified rate. Further-more, the state machine can control the order in which samples \nare extracted from RAM (forward/reverse), facilitating efficient \ngeneration of time symmetric waveforms. \nLoad/Retrieve RAM Operation \nIt is strongly recommended that RAM enable = 0 when \nperforming RAM load/retrieve operations. Loading or \nretrieving the contents of the RAM requires a three-step process.  \n1. Program the RAM Profile 0 through RAM Profile 7 control \nregisters with the start and end addresses that are to define \nthe boundaries of each independent waveform.  \n2. Drive the appropriate logic levels on the profile pins to \nselect the desired RAM profile.  3. Write to (or read from) the \nRAM ( Address 0x16) the \nappropriate number of RAM words as specified by the selected RAM profile control register (see the Serial Programming section for details). Figure 41 is a block \ndiagram showing the functional components used for RAM \ndata load/retrieve operation. \nDuring RAM load/retrieve operations, the state machine controls \nan up/down counter to step through the required RAM loca-\ntions. The counter synchronizes with the serial I/O port so that the serial/parallel conversion of the 32-bit words is correctly timed with the generation of the appropriate RAM address to properly execute the desired read or write operation. \nRAMADDRESS\nDATAQSCLK\nI/O_RESETSDIO\nCSPROFILE WAVEFORM END ADDRESSWAVEFORM START ADDRESS\nADDRESS CLOCKPROGRAMMING\nREGISTERS\nSTATE\nMACHINEUP/DOWN\nCOUNTER\nSERIAL\nI/O\nPORT2\n3210\n10\nU/D3\n06479-022 \nFigure 41. RAM Data Load/Retrieve Operation \nThe RAM profiles are completely independent; it is possible  \nto define overlapping address ranges. Doing so causes data  \nthat has been written to overlapped address locations to be \noverwritten by the most recent write operation. \nMultiple waveforms can be loaded into RAM by treating them \nas a single waveform, that is, a time-domain concatenation of all \nthe waveforms. This is done by programming one of the RAM profiles with a start and end address spanning the entire range \nof the concatenated waveforms. Then the single concatenated \nwaveform is written into RAM via the serial I/O port using the same RAM profile that was programmed with the start and end addresses. The RAM profiles must then be programmed with the proper start and end addresses associated with each \nindividual waveform.  \nRAM Playback Operation (Waveform Generation) \nWhen the RAM has been loaded with the desired waveform \ndata, it can then be used for waveform generation during play \nback. RAM playback requires that RAM enable = 1. To play back RAM data, select the desired waveform using the PROFILE[2:0] \npins. The selected profile directs the internal state machine by \ndefining the RAM address range occupied by the waveform, the rate at which samples are to be extracted from the RAM (playback rate), the mode of operation, and whether to use the no-dwell feature. Figure 42 is a block diagram showing the functional components used for RAM playback operation. \nData Sheet AD9910\n \nRev.

RAM Playback Operation \nDuring playback, the state machine uses an up/down counter to \nstep through the specified address locations. The clock rate of \nthis counter defines the playback rate, that is, the sample rate of \nthe generated waveform. The clocking of the counter is controlled by a 16-bit programmable timer that is internal to the state machine. This timer is clocked by the DDS clock, and its time interval is set by the 16-bit address step rate value stored in the selected RAM profile register. \nThe address step rate value determines the playback rate. For \nexample, if M is the 16-bit value of the address step rate for a \nspecific RAM profile, then the playback rate for that profile is given by \nMf\nMfRate PlaybackSYSCLK DDSCLOCK\n4\uf03d \uf03d  \nThe sample interval (Δt) associated with the playback rate is \ntherefore given by \nSYSCLKfM\nRate Playbackt4 1Δ \uf03d \uf03d  \nRAM data entry/retrieval via the I/O port takes precedence \nover playback operation. An I/O operation targeting the RAM \nduring playback interrupts any waveform in progress. \nThe 32-bit words output by the RAM during playback route to \nthe DDS signal control parameters according to two RAM \nplayback destination bits in Control Function Register 1. The \n32-bit words are partitioned based on Table 12.  \nTable 12.

The \noperation of this pin varies with the RAM operating mode  as detailed in the following sections. When RAM enable = 0, \nthis pin is forced to a Logic 0. \nOverview of RAM Playback Modes \nThe RAM can operate in any one of five different playback modes. \n\uf0b7 Direct switch \n\uf0b7 Ramp-up \n\uf0b7 Bidirectional ramp \n\uf0b7 Continuous bidirectional ramp \n\uf0b7 Continuous recirculate \nThe mode is selected via the 3-bit RAM mode control word \nlocated in each of the RAM profile registers. Thus, the RAM \noperating mode is profile dependent. The RAM profile mode \ncontrol bits are detailed in Table 13. \nTable 13. RAM Operating Modes \nRAM Profile \nMode Control Bits RAM Operating Mode \n000, 101, 110, 111 Direct switch \n001 Ramp-up \n010 Bidirectional ramp \n011 Continuous bidirectional ramp \n100 Continuous recirculate \nRAM Direct Switch Mode \nIn direct switch mode, the RAM is not used as a waveform genera-\ntor. Instead, when a RAM profile is selected via the PROFILE[2:0] \npins, only a single 32-bit word is routed to the DDS to be applied to the signal control parameter(s). This 32-bit word is the data \nstored in the RAM at the location given by the 10-bit waveform \nstart address of the selected profile. \nIn direct switch mode, the RAM_SWP_OVR pin is always \nLogic 0, and the no-dwell high bit is ignored. \nDirect switch mode enables up to eight-level FSK, PSK, or ASK \nmodulation; the type of modulation is determined by the RAM \nplayback destination bits (frequency for FSK and so on). Each \nRAM profile is associated with a specific value of frequency, \nphase, or amplitude. Each unique waveform start address value in each RAM profile allows access of the 32-bit word stored in that particular RAM location. In this way, the profile pins implement the shift-keying function, modulating the DDS \noutput as desired. \nAD9910 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 34 of 64 Note that two-level modulation can be accomplished by using \nonly one of the three profile pins to toggle between two differ-\nent parameter values. Likewise, four-level modulation can be accomplished by using only two of the three profile pins. There is no restriction on which profile pins are used. \nRAM Direct Switch Mode with Zero Crossing \nThe zero-crossing function (enabled with the zero-crossing bit)  \nis a special feature that is only available in RAM direct switch \nmode. The zero-crossing function is only valid if the RAM playback destination bits specify phase as the DDS signal control parameter. \nEnabling zero-crossing causes the DDS to delay the application \nof a new phase value until such time as the DDS phase accumula-\ntor rolls over from full scale to 0 (the point at which the DDS \nphase accumulator represents a phase angle that is at the 360° to 0° transition point). This can be a very beneficial feature when the DDS is programmed to generate a sine wave (using the select DDS sine output bit) because the zero-crossing point of \nphase for a sine wave corresponds with the zero-crossing point \nof amplitude. \nIn the case of binary phase shift keying (BPSK), the zero-\ncrossing feature allows the AD9910 to perform the 180° phase \njumps associated with BPSK with only a minimal instantaneous change in amplitude. This avoids the spectral splatter that \nfrequently accompanies BPSK modulation. \nAlthough the intent of the zero-crossing feature is for use with \nthe DDS sine output enabled, it can be used with a cosine \noutput. In this case, the phase values extracted from RAM are registered at the DDS when the output amplitude is at its peak \npositive value. \nRAM Ramp-Up Mode \nIn ramp-up mode, upon assertion of an I/O update or a change \nof profile, the RAM begins operating as a waveform generator \nusing the parameters programmed into the selected RAM profile register. Data is extracted from RAM over the specified address range and at the specified rate contained in the wave-\nform start address, waveform end address, and address ramp \nrate values of the selected RAM profile. The data is delivered  to the specified DDS signal control parameter(s) based on the \nRAM playback destination bits. \nThe internal state machine begins extracting data from the \nRAM at the waveform start address and continues to extract \ndata until it reaches the waveform end address. Upon reaching this address, it either remains at the waveform end address or returns to the waveform start address as defined by the no-dwell \nhigh bit. Then the state machine halts, and the RAM_SWP_OVR \npin goes high.  Ramp-Up Timing Diagram \nA graphic representation of the ramp-up mode appears in Figure 43, showing both normal and no-dwell operation. \nThe two upper traces show the progression of the RAM address \nfrom the waveform start address to the waveform end address \nfor the selected profile. The address value advances by one with \neach timeout of the timer internal to the state machine. The \ntimer period (Δt) is determined by the address ramp rate value for the selected profile. The two upper traces are differentiated \nby the state of the no-dwell high bit.  \n06479-024WAVEFORM START ADDRESS\nWAVEFORM START ADDRESSWAVEFORM END ADDRESS\n1M DDS CLOCK CYCLES\nWAVEFORM END ADDRESSNO-DWELL\nHIGH = 0\nNO-DWELL\nHIGH = 11RAM  ADDRESS\nRAM  ADDRESS\nRAM_SWP_OVER\nI/O_UPDATE\n1 2 3∆t\n \nFigure 43.

The n o-dwell high bit is ignored in this mode. The \ninternal profile control mode is identical to ramp -up mode \nexcept that profile switching is done automatically a nd \ninternally; the state of the PROFILE [2:0] pins is ignored. \nProfiles cycle a ccording to Table 14. \nThere are two types of waveform generation types available under internal profile control : burst waveforms and continuous \nwaveform s. With both types, the state machine begins with the \nwaveform specified by the waveform start addr ess, waveform \nend a ddress, and address ramp rat e in Profile 0. After reaching \nthe waveform end addre ss of Profile 0, the state machine automat i-\ncally advance s to the next profile and initiates the specified \nwaveform as defined by the new profile parameters. After the \nstate machine reaches the waveform end address of the new profile , it advances to the next profile. This action continues \nuntil the state m achine  reaches the waveform end address of  \nthe last profile , as governed by the i nternal profile control bits in \nControl Function Register 1 ( CFR1 ) per Table 14. At this point, the next course of action depends on whether the \nwaveform  type is burst or continuous. For burst waveforms, the \nstate machine halts operation after reaching the waveform end \naddress of the final profile. For continuous wav eforms, the state \nmachine automatically jumps to Profile 0 and continues the automatic  wave form generation  by sequentially  advancing \nthrough the profiles. This process co ntinues indefinitely until \nthe internal profile control bits are re program med and an I/O \nupdate is a sserted.  \nA burst waveform timing diagram is exemplified in Figure 44. \nThe diagram assumes that  the internal profile control bits in \nRegister CFR1  are programmed as 0010, the star t address in \nRAM Pr ofile 1 is greater than the end address in RAM Profile 0, \nand that the start address in RAM  Profile  2 is great er than the \nend address in RAM Profile 1. Ho wever, the block of RAM \nassociated with each profile can be chosen arbitrarily based on \nthe waveform start address and waveform end address for each \nprofile. Fu rthermore, the example shows how different Δ t \nvalues  associated with each profile can  be used . \nAD9910  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

E | Page 41 of 64 ADDITIONAL FEATURES \nPROFILES  \nThe AD9910 support s the use of profiles, which consist of a group  \nof eight registers containing pertinent operating param eters for \na part icular operating mode.  Profiles enable rapid swi tching \nbetween parameter sets. Profile parameters are progr ammed via \nthe serial I/O port. Once pr ogrammed, a specific profile is \nactivated by means of three external pins (PR OFILE [2:0]). A \nparticular profile is activated by providing the appropriate logic \nlevels to the profile control pins per Table 15. \nTable 15. Profile Control Pin s \nPROFILE [2:0]  Active Pr ofile \n000 0 \n001 1 \n010 2 \n011 3 \n100 4 \n101 5 \n110 6 \n111 7 \nThere are two different parameter sets that the eight profile registers can control depending on the operating mode of the \ndevice . When RAM e nable = 0, the profile parameters follow \nthe single tone  profile format detailed in the Register Map and \nBit D escriptions  section.  When RAM enable = 1, they follow \nthe RAM p rofile format.   \nAs an example of the use of profiles, c onsider an application for \nimplementing  basic two -tone frequency shift ke ying (FSK) . FSK \nuses the binary data  in a serial bit stream to  select between two \ndifferent frequencies:  a mark  frequency ( Logic 1) and a space \nfrequency ( Logic 0).  To accommodate FSK, the device operate s \nin single tone  mode . The Single Tone Profile 0  register  is pro-\ngrammed with the appropr iate frequency tuning word for a \nspace . The Single Tone  Profile 1  register  is programmed with \nthe appr opriate frequency tuning word for a mark.  Then, wi th \nthe PROFILE1 and PROFILE2  pins tied to Logic 0, the  PROFILE0 pin is connected to the serial bit strea m. In this way, t he logic \nstate of the PROFILE0  pin causes the appropriate mark and \nspace frequencies to be gener ated in accordance with the binary \ndigits of the bit stream . \nThe profile pins must meet setup and hold times to the rising \nedge of SYNC_CLK.  \nI/O_UPDATE, SYNC_CLK, AND  SYSTEM  CLOCK  \nRELATIONSHIPS  \nThe I/O_UPDATE  pin is used to transfer data from the serial \nI/O buffer to the active registers in the device. Data in the buffer is inactive.  \nSYNC_CLK is a rising edge active signal. It is derived from th e \nsystem clock and a divide -by-4 frequency divider. SYNC_CLK, \nwhich is externally provided, can be used to synchronize  external \nhardware to the AD9910 internal clocks.  \nI/O_UPDATE initiates the start of a buffer transfer. It can be \nsent synchronously or asynchronously relative to the  SYNC_CLK. \nIf the setup time between these signals is met, then constant \nlatency (pipeline) to the DAC output exists. For example, if repetitive changes to phase offset via the SPI port is desired,  \nthe latency of those changes to the DAC output is constant; \notherwise, a time uncertainty of one SYNC_CLK period is present.  \nBy default, the I/O_UPDATE pin is an input that serves as a \nstrobe signal to allow synchronous update of the device opera t-\ning parameters.  A rising edge on I/O_UPDATE initiates transfer \nof the register contents to the internal wor kings of the device.  \nAlternatively, the transfer of programmed data from the progra m-\nming registers to the internal hardware can be  accomplished by \nchan ging the state of the PROFILE[2:0] pins.  \nThe timing diagram shown in Figure 49 depicts when  the data \nin the buffer is transferred to the active registers.  \n \nSYNC_CLKSYSCLK\nA B\nN N + 1 N – 1DATA IN\nREGISTERS\nDATA IN\nI/O BUFFERS N N + 1 N + 2I/O_UPDATE\nTHE DEVICE REGISTERS AN I/O UPDATE AT POINT A.

E | Page 42 of 64 AUTOMATIC I/O UPDATE  \nThe AD9910 offers an option whereby the I/O u pdate function \nis asserted automatically rather than relying on an external signal  \nsupplied by the use r. This feature is enabled by setting the internal \nI/O update active bit in C ontrol Function Register  2 (CFR2) . \nWhen this feature is active, the I/O_UPDATE pin becomes an \noutput pin. It generates an active high pulse each time an inter -\nnal I/O update occur s. The pulse width is determine by the I/O \nupdate rate control bits (CFR2 [15:14] ). Table 16 approximates the \npulse width setting.  \nTable 16.

There are two parameters that control \nthe repetition rate.  The first consists of the two I /O update rate \ncontrol bits in CFR2.  The second is the 32 -bit word in the I /O \nupdate r ate register that sets the range of an inter nal counter.  \nThe I /O update rate control bits establish a divide -by-1, -2, -4,  \nor -8 of a clock signal that runs at ¼ f SYSCLK . The output of the \ndivider clocks the aforementioned 32 -bit internal counter.  The \nrepetition rate of the I/O u pdate is give n by  \nBffASYSCLK\nUPDATEOI 2 _/2+=  \nwhere :  \nA is the value of the 2 -bit word comprising the I /O update rate \ncontrol bits. \nB is the value of the 32 -bit word stored in the I /O update rate \nregister .  \nThe default value of A is 0 , and the value of B is 0xFFFF . If B is \nprogr ammed to 0x 0003 or less, the I/O_UPDATE pin no longer \npulses but assumes a static L ogic 1 state.  POWER -DOWN CONTROL  \nThe AD9910 offers the ability to independently power down \nfour specific sections of the device.  Power -down functionality \napplies to the  following:  \n• Digital core  \n• DAC  \n• Auxiliary DAC  \n• Input REFCLK clock circuitry  \nA power -down of  the digital core disables the ability to update \nthe serial I/O p ort. However, the dig ital power -down bit can \nstill be cleared via the serial port  to prevent  the possibility of a \nnonrecoverable state.  \nSoftware power -down is controlled via four independent  power -\ndown bits in C ontrol Function Register 1 (CFR1). Software \ncontrol requires that the EXT _PWR _DWN pin be forced to a \nLogic 0 state.  In this case, setting the desired power -down bits \n(via the se rial I/O p ort) powers down the associated functional \nblock,  whereas  clearing the bits restores the function.  \nAlternatively, all four functions can be simultaneously powered \ndown via external har dware control through the EXT _PWR _DWN \npin. When this pin is forced to L ogic 1, all four ci rcuit blocks are \npowered down r egardless of the state of the power -down bits;  \nthat is, the independent power -down bits in CFR1 are ignored \nand overridden when EXT _PWR _DWN is L ogic 1.  \nBased on the state of the e xternal power -down control bit, the \nEXT _PWR _DWN pin produces either a full  power-down or a \nfast recovery  power -down.  The fast recovery  power -down mode \nmaintains power to the DAC bias circuitry and the PLL, VCO , \nand input clock  circuitry.  Although the fast re covery  power -\ndown does not cons erve as much power as the full  power -down, \nit allows the d evice to awaken very quickly from the power -\ndown state.  \n \nData Sheet AD9910\n \nRev. E | Page 43 of 64 SYNCHRONIZATION OF MULTIPLE DEVICES \nMultiple devices are synchronized when their clock states match \nand they transition between states simultaneously. Clock \nsynchronization allows the user to asynchronously program multiple devices but synchronously activate the programming by \napplying a coincident I/O update to all devices \nThe function of the synchronization logic in the AD9910 is to \nforce the internal clock generator to a predefined state coincident \nwith an external synchronization signal applied to the SYNC_INx pins. If all devices are forced to the same clock state in synchro-\nnization with the same external signal, then the devices are, by \ndefinition, synchronized. Figure 50 is a block diagram of the synchronization function. The synchronization logic is divided into two independent blocks: a sync generator and a sync receiver, \nboth of which use the local SYSCLK signal for internal timing.  \n06479-050SYNC\nGENERATORREF_CLK\n5SYSCLK\nINTERNAL\nCLOCKS5\n4SYNC\nRECEIVER\nSYNC\nGENERATOR\nENABLE\nSYNC\nGENERATOR\nDELAYSYNC\nPOLARITY90\n91\n9\n10REF_CLK\nINPUT\nCIRCUITRY\n7\n8\n12SYNC_IN+REF_CLK\nSYNC_IN–\nSYNC_SMP_ERR\nSYNC\nVALIDATION\nDELAYSYNC\nTIMING\nVALIDATION\nDISABLECLOCK\nGENERATORSETUP AND\nHOLD VALIDATIONSYNC\nRECEIVER\nENABLESYNC\nRECEIVER\nDELAY\nINPUT DELAY\nAND EDGE\nDETECTIONSYNC_OUT+\nSYNC_OUT–\n \nFigure 50.

Multichip Synchronization Example \n \nThe sync receiver accepts a periodic clock signal at the SYNC_ \nINx pins. This signal is assumed to originate from an LVDS-\ncompatible driver. The user can delay the SYNC_INx signal in \nsteps of ~75 ps by programming the 5-bit input sync receiver \ndelay word in the multichip sync register. The signal at the output of the programmable delay is referred to as the delayed \nSYNC_INx signal. \nNote that an internal 100 Ω LVDS termination resistor exists \nacross both SYNC_IN inputs. \nThe edge detection logic generates a sync pulse having a dura-\ntion of one SYSCLK cycle with a repetition rate equal to the \nfrequency of the signal applied to the SYNC_INx pins. The  sync pulse is generated as a result of sampling the rising edge  of the delayed SYNC_INx signal with the rising edge of the \nlocal SYSCLK. The sync pulse is routed to the internal clock \ngenerator, which behaves as a presettable counter clocked at the SYSCLK rate. The sync pulse presets the counter to a predefined state (programmable via the 6-bit sync state preset value word in the multichip sync register). The predefined state is only active \nfor a single SYSCLK cycle, after which the clock generator resumes \ncycling through its state sequence at the SYSCLK rate. This unique state presetting mechanism gives the user the flexibility to synchronize devices with specific relative clock state offsets (by assigning a different sync state preset value word to each \ndevice).  \nMultiple device synchronization is accomplished by providing \neach AD9910 with a SYNC_INx signal that is edge aligned \nData Sheet  AD9910  \n \nRev. E | Page 45 of 64 across all the devices. If the SYNC_IN x signal is edge aligned at all \ndevices , and all devices have the same sync receiver delay and \nsync state preset value, then they all have matc hing clock states \n(that is , they are synchr onized).  This concept is shown  in  \nFigure 53, in which three AD9910 device s are synchronized ,  \nwith one  device operating as a master timing unit and the  \nothers as slave units. \nThe master device must have its SYNC_IN x pins i ncluded as  part \nof the synchronization distr ibution and delay equalization mecha -\nnism  in order for it to be synchronized with the slave units.   \nThe synchronization mechanism begins with the clock distr ibu-\ntion and delay equalization block, which is u sed to ensure that \nall devices recei ve an edge- aligned REFCLK signal. However, \neven though the  REFCLK signal is edge aligned among all devices, \nthis alone does not guarantee that the clock state of each  internal \nclock generator is coordinated with the others.  This is the role \nof the s ynchronization and d elay equal ization block.  This block \naccepts t he SYNC_OUT x signal generated by the master device \nand redi stributes it to the SYNC_IN x input of the slave units (as \nwell as feeding it back to the master).  The goal of the  redistributed \nSYNC_OUT x signal from the master device is to deliver an \nedge -aligne d SYNC_IN x signal to all of the sync r eceivers . \nAssuming that all devices share the same REFCLK edge (due to \nthe clock distribution and delay equalization bloc k), and all \ndevices share the same SYNC_IN x edge (due to the sy nchroni -\nzation and delay equalizat ion block ), then all devices should \ngenerat e an internal sync pulse in unison (assuming that they \nall have the same sync receiver delay value).  With the further \nstipulation that all devices have the same sync state preset value, \nthen the synchronized sync pulses cause all of the devices to assume the same predefined clock state simu ltaneously ; that is, \nthe internal clocks of all devices b ecome  fully sy nchronized.  \nThe synchronization mechanism depends on the reliable ge n-\neration of a sync pulse by the edge d etection block in the sync \nreceiver.  Generation of a valid sync pulse, however, requires \nproper sampling of the rising edge of the delayed SYNC_ INx signal \nwith the rising edge of the local SYSCLK . If the edge timing of \nthese signals fails to meet the setup  or hold time requirements \nof the internal latches in the edge detection circuitry, then the \nproper generation of the sync pulse is in jeo pardy.  The setup  \nand hold validation block (see Figure 54) gives the user a means \nto validat e that proper edge timing exists between the two  signals. \nThe setup  and hold validation block can  be disabled via the \nsync timing validation disable bit in C ontrol Function Register  2.  \nThe validation block makes use of a user -specified time window \n(programmable in increments of ~75  ps via the 4 -bit sync \nvalida tion delay word in the m ultichip sync register ). The setup  \nvalidation and h old validation circuits use latches ide ntical to \nthose in the rising edge detector and strobe generator . The \nprogrammable ti me wi ndow is used to skew the timing between \nthe rising edges of the local SYSCLK signal and the rising edges \nof the delayed SYNC_ INx signal. If either the hold or setup \nvalidation circuits fail to detect a valid edge sample, the  condition \nis indicated externally via the SYNC_SMP_ERR pin (a ctive high).  \nThe user must choose a sync validation dela y value that is a \nreasonable fraction of the SYSCLK period.  For exa mple, if the \nSYSCLK frequency is 1  GHz (1  ns period), then a re asonable \nvalue is 4 ( 300 ps). Choos ing too large a value can cause the \nSYNC_SMP_ERR pin to generate false error signals.  Choosing \ntoo small a value may cause instabi lity. \n \nSYNC\nPULSE\nSYSCLKDELAY\nDELAY\nCHECK LOGIC4\nSYNC VALIDATION\nDELAY44SYNC_SMP_ERRSYNC RECEIVER\n12\nSYNC TIMING VALIDATION DISABLESETUP\nVALIDATION\nHOLD\nVALIDATIONDQ\n12SETUP AND HOLD VALIDATIONTO\nCLOCK\nGENERATION\nLOGICFROM\nSYNC\nRECEIVER\nDELAY\nLOGIC\nDQ\nDQRISING EDGE\nDETECTOR\nAND STROBE\nGENERATOR\n06479-054 \nFigure 54.

E | Page 46 of 64 POWER SUPPLY PARTITI ONING  \nThe AD9910 features multiple power supplies, and their power \nconsumption varies with its configuration. This section covers \nwhich power supplies can be grouped together and how the \npower consumption of each block varies with frequency.  \nThe values quoted in this section are for comparison only. Refer \nto Table 1 for exact values. Wit h each group , use 0.1 μF or 0.01  μF \nbypass capacitors  in parallel with a 10 μF capacitor . \nThe recommendations here are for typical applications, for which there are four groups of power supplies: 3.3  V digital,  \n3.3 V analog, 1.8 V digital, and 1.8 V analo g.  \nApplications demanding the highest performance may require additional power supply isolation.  \n3.3 V SUPPLIES  \nDVDD_I/O (3.3  V) (Pin 11, Pin 15, Pin 21, Pin 28, Pin 45, \nPin 56, and Pin 66)  \nThese 3.3 V supplies can be grouped together. The power consumpti on on these pins varies dynamically with serial port \nactivity.  \nAVDD (3.3  V) (Pin 74 to Pin 77 and Pin 83)  \nThese are 3.3 V DAC power supplies that typically consume about 28 mA. At a minimum, a ferrite bead should be used to isolate these from other 3.3 V supplies, with a separate regulator being ideal. The current consumption of these supplies consist mainly of biasing current and do not vary with frequency.  1.8 V SUPPLIES  \nDVDD (1.8  V) (Pin 17, Pin 23, Pin 30, Pin 47, Pin 57, and \nPin 64)  \nThese pins can be  grouped together. Their current consumption \nincreases linearly wi th the system clock frequency. See Figure 17 \nand Figure 18 for typical  current co nsumption curves . There is \nalso a slight (~5%) increase as f OUT increases from 50 MHz to \n400 MHz.  \nAVDD (1.8  V) (Pin 3)  \nThis 1.8 V supply powers the REF CLK multiplier (PLL) and \nconsumes about 7 mA. For applications demanding the highest performance with the PLL enabled, this supply should be \nisolated from other 1 .8 V AVDD suppl ies with a separate \nregulator. For less demanding applications, this supply can be \nrun off the same regulator as Pin 89  and Pin 92 with a ferrite \nbead to isolate Pin 3 from Pin 89  and Pin 92 .  \nThe loop filter for the PLL should directly conn ect to Pin 3. If \nthe PLL is bypassed, Pin 3 should still be powered, but isolation \nis not critical.  \nAVDD (1.8  V) (Pin 6)  \nThis pin can be grouped together with the DVDD 1.8  V supply \npins. For the highest performance, a ferrite bead should be used \nfor isolat ion, with a separate regulator being ideal.  \nAVDD (1.8  V) (Pin 89 and Pin 92)  \nThis 1.8 V supply for the REF CLK input consumes about  \n15 mA. These pins can run off the supply of Pin 3  with a ferrite \nbead to isolate Pin 3 from Pin 89 and Pin 92. At a minimum,  a \nferrite bead should be used to isolate these from other 1.8  V \nsupplies. However, for applications demanding the highest performance, a separate regulator is recommended.  \n \n \nData Sheet  AD9910  \n \nRev. E | Page 47 of 64 SERIAL PROGRAMMING \nCONTROL INTERFACE —SERIAL I/O  \nThe AD9910 serial port is a flexible, synchronous serial commu -\nnications port allowing easy interface to many indu stry-standard  \nmicroc ontrol lers and microprocessors. The serial I/O is compatible \nwith most synchronous transfer formats . \nThe interface allows read/write access to all registers that  confi gure \nthe AD9910. MSB- first or LSB -first transfer formats are  \nsupported. In add ition, the serial interface port can be configured \nas a single pin input/o utput  (SDIO)  allowing a 2-wire inte rface, \nor it can  \nbe configured as two unidirectional pins for in put/output \n(SDIO/SDO)  enabling  a 3-wire interface. Two optional pins \n(I/O_RESET and CS) enable greater flexibility for designing \nsystem s with the AD9910.  \nGENERAL SERIAL I/O OPERATION  \nThere are two phases to a serial comm unications cycle. The first \nis the instruction phase  to write  the instruction byte into the \nAD9910. The instruction byte contains the address of the  register \nto be accessed (see the Register Map and Bit De scriptions  \nsection) and defines whether the upcoming data transfer is a \nwrite or read operation.  \nFor a writ e cycle, Phase 2 represents the data transfer between \nthe serial port controller to the serial port buffer. The number of bytes transferred is a function of the register being accessed. For example, when accessing the Control Function Register 2 \n(Address  0x01), Phase 2 requires that four bytes be transferred. \nEach bit of data is registered on each corresponding rising edge of SCLK. The serial port controller expects that all by tes of the \nregister be accessed;  otherwise , the serial port controller is  put \nout of sequence for the next communication cycle. However, \none way to write fewer  bytes than required is to use the I /O_RESET  \npin feature. The I /O_RESET pin function can be used to abort \nan I/O operation and reset the pointer of the serial port con -\ntroller. A fter an I /O reset , the next byte is the instruction byte. \nNote  that every completed byte written prior to a n I/O reset  is \npreserved in the serial port buffer. Partial bytes written are not preserved. At the completion of any communication cycle, the \nAD9910 serial port controller expects the next eight  rising \nSCLK edges to be the instruct ion byte for the next communi -\ncation cycle.  \nAfter a write cycle, the programmed data resides in the serial \nport buffer and is inactive. I/O_UPDATE transfers data from the serial port buffer to active registers. The I/O  update  can be \nsent either after each  communication cycle or when all serial \noperations are complete. In addition, a change in profile pins \ncan initiate a n I/O update . \nFor a read cycle, Phase 2 is the same as the write cycle with the following differences: data is read from the active registe rs, not the s erial port buffer , and d ata is driven o ut on the falling edge \nof SCLK.  \nNote that to read back any profile register (0x0E to 0x15), the \nthree external profile pins must be used. For example, if the \nprofile register is Profile 5 (0x13) , then the PROFILE [0:2] pins \nmust equal 101.This is not required to write to profile registers. \nINSTRUCTION BYTE  \nThe instruction byte contains the following information as shown in the instruction byte information bit map.  \nInstruction Byte Information  Bit Map  \nMSB        LSB \nD7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 \nR/W X X A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 \nR/W—Bit 7 of the instruction byte determines whether a read \nor write data transfer occurs after th e instruction byte write. \nLogic 1  indicates  a read operation. Cl eared  indicates a write \noper ation.  \nX, X —Bit 6 and Bit 5 of the instruction byte are don’t care s. \nA4, A3, A2, A1, A0 —Bit 4, Bit 3, Bit 2, Bit 1, and Bit 0 of the \ninstruction byte determine which register is accessed during the \ndata transfer portion of the c ommunications cycle.  \nSERIAL I/O PORT PIN DESCRIPTION S \nSCLK —Seria l Clock  \nThe serial clock pin is used to synchronize data to and from the \nAD9910 and to run the internal state m achines.  \nCS—Chip Select Bar  \nCS is an active low input that allows more than one device on \nthe same serial communications line.  The SDO and SDIO pins \ngo to a high impedance state when this input is high. If driven high during any commun ications cycle, that cycle is suspended \nuntil \nCS is reactivated low. Chip s elect (CS) can be tied low in \nsystem s that maintain control of SCLK.  \nSDIO —Serial Data Input/Output  \nData is always written into the AD9910 on this pin. Howeve r, \nthis pin can be used as a bi directional data line. Bit 1 of CFR1  \nRegister Address 0x00 controls the co nfiguration of this pin. \nThe default is cleared , whic h configures the SDIO pin as \nbidirectional.  \nSDO —Serial Data  Out  \nData is read from this pin for protocols that use separate lines for transmitting and receiving data. When the AD9910 operates \nin single bi directional I/O mode, this pin does not output data \nand is set to a high impedance state.  \nAD9910  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 48 of 64 I/O_RESET —Input/Output Reset  \nI/O_RESET s ynchronizes the I/O port state machines without \naffecting the co ntents  of the addressable registers. An active \nhigh input on the I /O_RESET pin causes the current  communica-\ntion cycle to abort. After I /O_RESET returns low ( Logic 0 ), \nanother communication cycle can begin, star ting with the \ninstruction byte write.  \nI/O_UPDATE —Input /Output  Update   \nThe I/O _UPDATE  initiates the transfer of written data from  \nthe I/O port buffer to active registers. I/O_ UPDATE  is active   \non the  rising edge , and its pulse width must be greater than one \nSYNC_CLK period. It is either an input or o utpu t pin depending  \non the programming of the i nternal I /O update active bit.  SERIAL I/O TIMING DIAGRAMS  \nFigure 55 through Figure 58 provide basic examples of the timing \nrelationships between the various  control signals of the  serial \nI/O port. Most of the bits in the register map are not transferred \nto their internal de stinations until assertion of an I/O update, \nwhich is not included in the timing dia grams that follow.  \nMSB/LSB TRANSFERS  \nThe AD9910 serial port can support both most significant bit \n(MSB) first or least significant bit (L SB) first data formats. This \nfunctionality is controlled by Bit 0 in Control Function  Register  1 \n(0x00). The default format is MSB first. If LSB first is active, all \ndata, including the instruction byte, must follow LSB -first conven-\ntion. Note  that the hig hest number found in the bit range  column \nfor each register is the MSB , and the lowest number is the LSB \nfor that register  (see the Register Map and Bit De scriptions  \nsection and Table 17).\n \nI7 SDIOINSTRUCTION CYCLE DATA TRANSFER CYCLE\nSCLKCS\nI6 I5 I4 I3 I2 I1 I0 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\n06479-030 \nFigure 55.

E | Page 54 of 64 REGISTER BIT DESCRI PTIONS  \nThe serial I/O p ort registers span an address range of 0  to 23 \n(0x00 to 0x16  in hexadecimal notation). This represents a total \nof 24 registers. However, two of these registers are unused , \nyielding a total of 22 available re gisters. The unused registers are \nRegi ster 5 and Register 6 ( 0x05 and 0x06, respectively ). \nThe number of bytes assigned to the registers varies. That is, the \nregisters are not of uniform depth; each contains the number of \nbytes nece ssary for its particular function. Additionally, the \nregisters are assigned names a ccording to their functionality. In \nsome cases, a register is given a mnemonic descriptor. For example, the register at Serial A ddress 0x00 is named Control \nFunction Register 1 and is assigned the mn emonic CFR1.  \nThe following section p rovides a detailed description of each bit \nin the AD9910 register map. F or cases in  which a group of bits \nserve s a specific function, the entire group is considered a \nbinary word and described in aggregate.  This section is organized in sequential order of the serial addresses \nof the registers. Each subheading includes the register name and optional register mnemonic (in parentheses).  Also given is the \nserial address in hexadecimal  format  and the number of bytes \nassigned to the register. \nFollowing each subheading is a table containing  the individual \nbit descriptions for that particular re gister. The location of the \nbit(s) in the re gister is indicated by a single number or a pair of \nnumbers separated by a colon ; that is, a pair of numbers (A:B) \nindicates  a range of bits from  the most significant (A) to the \nleast significant (B). For e xample , 5:2 implies  Bit Position  5 \ndown to Bit Position 2, inclusive, with Bit 0 identifying the LSB \nof the regi ster. \nUnless otherwise stated, programmed bits are not transferred to \ntheir inte rnal destinations until the assertion of the I/O_U PDATE  \npin or a profi le change.  \nControl Function Register 1 (CFR1) —Address 0x00  \nFour bytes are assigned to this register.  \nTable 18.
