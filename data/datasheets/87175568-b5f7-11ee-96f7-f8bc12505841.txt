The \noutput frequency and phase are soft ware programmable, \nallowing easy  tuning. No external components are needed. The \nfrequency registers are 28 bits , and  with a 25 MHz clock rate, \nresolution of 0.1 Hz can be achieved. Similarly, with a 1 MHz clock rate, the AD9833 can be tuned to 0.004 Hz resolution.  \nThe AD9833 is written to via a 3 -wire serial interface. This \nserial interface operates at clock rates up to 40 MHz and is compatible with DSP and mi crocontroller standards. The device \noperates with a power supply from 2.3 V to 5.5 V .  \nThe AD9833 has a power -down function (SLEEP). This function  \nallows sections of the device that are not being used to be powered  \ndown thus minimizing the current consumpti on of the part, for \nexample,  the DAC can be powered down when a clock output is \nbeing generated.  \nThe AD9833 is available in a 10 -lead MSOP package.  \nFUNCTIONAL  BLOCK  DIAGRAM  \nSERIAL INTER FACE\nAND\nCONT ROL LOGIC\nSCLK SDATA FSYNCCONT ROL REGISTERPHASE1  REGPHASE0  REG\nMUXSIN\nROM10-BIT DACMUXFREQ0 REG\nFREQ1 REG12ON-B OARD\nREFERENCEAGND DGND VDD\nAD9833PHASE\nACCUMUL ATOR\n(28-BIT)REGUL ATORCAP/2.5V\n2.5VAVDD/\nDVDD\nMUXDIVIDE\nBY 2MSBMUXFULL-SCALE\nCONT ROLCOMP\nVOUT\nR\n200ΩMCLK\n02704-001 \nFigure 1.  \nAD9833    \n \nRev.

This pin is used for decoupling the DAC bias voltage.  \n2 VDD Positive Power Supply for the Analog and the Digital Interface Sections. The on -board 2.5 V regu lator is also \nsupplied from VDD. VDD can have a value from 2.3 V to 5.5 V. A 0.1 µ F and a 10 µF decoupling capacitor should \nbe connected between VDD and AGND.  \n3 CAP/2.5 V  The digital circuitry operates from a 2.5 V power supply. This 2.5 V is generated fr om VDD using an on -board \nregulator (when VDD exceeds 2.7 V). The regulator requires a decoupling capacitor of typically 100 nF, which is \nconnected from CAP/2.5 V to DGND. If VDD is equal to or less than 2.7 V, CAP/2.5 V should be tied directly to VDD.  \n4 DGND  Digital Ground.  \n5 MCLK  Digital Clock Input. DDS output frequencies are expressed as a binary fraction of the frequency of MCLK. The \noutput frequency accuracy and phase noise are determined by this clock.  \n6 SDATA  Serial Data Input. The 16 -bit serial d ata-word is applied to this input.  \n7 SCLK  Serial Clock Input. Data is clocked into the AD9833 on each falling SCLK edge.  \n8 FSYNC  Active Low Control Input. This is the frame synchronization signal for the input data. When FSYNC is taken low, the internal  logic is informed that a new word is being loaded into the device.  \n9 AGND  Analog Ground.  \n10 VOUT  Voltage Output. The analog and digital output from the AD9833 is available at this pin. An external load resistor is not required because the device has  a 200 Ω  resistor on board.  \n \n \n   AD9833  \n \nRev.

C | Page 10 of 24 TERMINOLOGY  \nIntegral Nonlinearity  \nThis is the maximum deviation of any code from a straight line \npassing through the endpoints of the transfer function. The \nendpoints of the transfer function are zero scale, a point 0.5 LSB \nbelow the first code transition (000 . . . 00 to 000 . . . 01), and full scale, a point 0.5 LSB above the last code transition (111 . . . 10 to 111 . . . 11). The error is expressed in LSBs.  \nDifferential Nonlinearity  \nThis is the difference between the measured and ideal 1 LSB change between two adjacent codes in the DAC. A specified \ndifferential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB maximum ensures \nmonotonicity.  \nOutput Compliance  \nThe output compliance refers to the maximum voltage that can be generated at the output of the DAC to meet the specifications . \nWhen voltages greater than that specified for the output compliance are generated, the AD9833 may not meet the \nspecifications listed in the data sheet.  \nSpurious -Free Dynamic Range  (SFDR)  \nAlong with the frequency of interest, harmonics of the \nfundamental frequency and images of these frequencies are present at the output of a DDS device. SFDR refers to the largest spur or harmonic present in the band of i nterest. The wideband \nSFDR gives the magnitude of the largest harmonic or spur relative  \nto the magnitude of the fundamental frequency in the zero  to \nNyquist bandwidth. The narrow -band SFDR gives the attenuation  of the largest spur or harmonic in a bandwidt h of ±200 kHz \nabout the fundamental frequency.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion  (THD) \nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of harmonics to the rms value of the fundamental. For the AD9833 , THD is defined as  \n12\n62\n52\n42\n32\n2log20 THDVV V V V V ++++=  \nwhere V1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental and V2, V3, \nV4, V5, and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second through \nsixth harmonics.  \nSignal -to-Noise Ratio (SNR)  \nSNR is the ratio of the rms value of the measured output signal \nto the rms sum of all other spectral components below the \nNyqui st frequency. The value for SNR is expressed in decibels.  \nClock Feedthrough  \nThere will be feedthrough from the MCLK input to the analog \noutput. Clock feedthrough refers to the magnitude of the MCLK  \nsignal relative to the fundamental frequency in the output  \nspectrum  of the AD9833. \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   AD9833  \n \nRev.  C | Page 11 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nSine waves are typically thought of in terms of their magnitude \nform a(t) = sin(ωt). However, these are nonlinear and not easy to generate except through piecewise construction. On the other hand, the angular information is linear in nature. That is, the phase angle rotates through a fixed angle for each unit of \ntime. The angular rate depends on the frequency of the signal \nby the traditional rate of ω = 2π f. \nMAGNITUDE\nPHASE+1\n0\n–1\n2p\n02π 4π6π\n2π 4π 6π\n02704-023 \nFigure 23.

A simple DDS chip can implement this equation with three major subcircuits: numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) and phase \nmod ulator , SIN ROM, and digital- to-analog converter  (DAC) . \nEach of these subcircuits is discussed in the following section.  \n \n \nAD9833     \n \nRev. C | Page 12 of 24 CIRCUIT  DESCRIPTION \nThe AD9833 is a fully integrated direct digital synthesis (DDS) \nchip. The chip requires one reference clock, on e low precision \nresistor, and decoupling capacitors to provide digitally created sine waves up to 12.5 MHz. In addition to the generation of this RF signal, the chip is fully capable of a broad range of simple \nand complex modulation schemes. These modulati on schemes \nare fully implemented in the digital domain, allowing accurate \nand simple realization of complex modulation algorithms using \nDSP techniques.  \nThe internal circuitry of the AD9833 consists of the following \nmain sections: a NCO, frequency and phase  modulators, SIN \nROM, a DAC , and a regulator.  \nNUMERICALLY CONTROLLED OSCILLATOR PLUS \nPHASE MODULATOR  \nThis consists of two frequency select registers, a phase accumulator , \ntwo phase offset registers, and a phase offset adder. The main \ncomponent of the NCO i s a 28 -bit phase accumulator. Continuous \ntime signals have a phase range of 0 to 2 π. Outside this range of \nnumbers, the sinusoid functions repeat themselves in a periodic \nmanner. The digital implementation is no different. The \naccumulator simply scales the  range of phase numbers into a \nmultibit digital word. The phase accumulator in the AD9833 is implemented with 28 bits. Therefore, in the AD9833, 2 π = 228. \nLikewise, the Δ Phase term is scaled into this range of numbers  \n0 < Δ Phase < 2\n28 − 1. With these subs titutions, the previous equation  \nbecomes  \nf = Δ Phase × fMCLK∕228 \nwhere 0 < Δ Phase  < 228 − 1 \nThe input to the phase accumulator can be selected either from the FREQ0 register or FREQ1 register and is controlled by the FSELECT bit. NCOs inherently generate co ntinuous phase \nsignals, thus avoiding any output discontinuity when switching between frequencies.  \nFollowing the NCO, a phase offset can be added to perform phase modulation using the 12 -bit phase registers. The contents \nof one of these phase registers are  added to the most significant \nbits of the NCO. The AD9833 has two phase registers; their resolution is 2 π/4096.  SIN ROM  \nTo make the output from the NCO useful, it must be converted from phase information into a sinusoidal value. Because  phase \ninformation maps directly into amplitude, the SIN  ROM uses the  \ndigital phase information as an address to a look -up table and \nconverts the phase information into amplitude. Although the NCO  \ncontains a 28 -bit phase accumulator, the output of the NCO is \ntruncated to 12 bits. Using the full resolution of the phase accumulator is impractical and unnecessary, because  this wou ld \nrequire a look -up table of 2\n28 entries. It is necessary only to have \nsufficient phase resolution such that the errors due to truncation  \nare smaller than the resolution of the 10 -bit DAC. This requires \nthat the SIN ROM have two bits of phase resolution m ore than \nthe 10 -bit DAC.  \nThe SIN ROM is enabled using the mode  bit (D1) in the control  \nregister. This is explained further in Table 15. \nDIGITAL -TO-ANALOG CONVERTER  (DAC)  \nThe AD9833 includes a high impedance , current source 10- bit \nDAC. The DAC receives the digital words from the SIN ROM and converts them into the corresponding analog voltages. \nThe DAC is configured for single -ended operation. An external \nload resistor is not required because the device has a 200 Ω  \nresistor on board. The DAC generates an output voltage of \ntypically 0.6 V p -p. \nREGULATOR  \nVDD provides the power supply required for the analog section \nand the digital section of the AD9833. This supply can have a \nvalue of 2.3 V to 5.5 V .  \nThe internal dig ital section of the AD9833 is operated at 2.5 V . \nAn on -board regulator steps down the voltage applied at VDD \nto 2.5 V . When the applied voltage at the VDD pin of the AD9833  \nis equal to or less than 2.7 V , the CAP/2.5 V and VDD pins should be tied together,  thus bypassing the on -board regulator.  \n \n \n \n   AD9833  \n \nRev.  C | Page 13 of 24 FUNCTIONAL  DESCRIPTION \nSERIAL INTERFACE  \nThe AD9833 has a standard 3- wire serial interface that is \ncompatible with SPI®, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP \ninterface standards.  \nData is loaded into the device as a 16 -bit word under the \ncontrol of a serial clock input, SCLK. The timing diagram for \nthis ope ration is given in Figure 4. \nThe FSYNC input is a level -triggered input that acts as a frame \nsynchronization and chip enable. Data can be transferred into the  \ndevice only when FSYNC is low. To start the serial data transfer, FSYNC  should be taken low, observing the minimum FSYNC -\nto-SCLK falling edge setup time, t\n7. After FSYNC goes low, serial \ndata is shifted into the input shift register of the device on the \nfalling edges of SCLK for 16 clock pulses. FSYNC may be taken high after the 16th falling edge of SCLK, observing the minimum  \nSCLK falling edge to FSYNC rising edge time, t\n8. Alternatively, \nFSYNC can be kept low for a multiple of 16 SCLK pulses and \nthen brought high at the end of the data transfer. In this way, a \ncontinuous str eam of 16 -bit words can be loaded while FSYNC \nis held low, FSYNC only going high after the 16th SCLK falling edge of the last word loaded.  \nSCLK can be continuous, or alternatively , it can idle high or low \nbetween write operations , but it must be high when FSYNC \ngoes low (t\n11). \nFor an example of programming the AD9833 , see t he AN -1070 \nApplication Note, Programming the AD9833/AD9834, at \nwww.analog.com . \nPOWERING UP THE AD98 33 \nThe flowchart in Figu re 26. shows the operating routine for the \nAD9833. When the AD9833 is powered up, the part should be \nreset. This will reset appropriate internal registers to zero to provide an analog output of midscale. To avoid spurious DAC \noutputs while the AD9833 is b eing initialized, the reset  bit \nshould be set to 1 until the part is ready to begin generating an output. RESET does not reset the phase, frequency, or control \nregisters. These registers will contain invalid data, and therefore , \nshould be set to a known va lue by the user. The reset  bit should  \nthen be set to 0 to begin generating an output. The data will appear  \non the DAC output eight MCLK cycles after reset  is set to 0.  \nLATENCY  \nAssociated with each asynchronous write operation in the AD9833  \nis a latency. If  a selected frequency/phase register is loaded with \na new word, there is a delay of seven to eight MCLK cycles before  \nthe analog output will change. (There is an uncertainty of one \nMCLK cycle, because  it depends on the position of the MCLK \nrising edge when  the data is loaded into the destination register.)  \nCONTROL REGISTER  \nThe AD9833 contains a 16- bit control register that sets up the \nAD9833 as the user wants to operate it. All control bits, except \nmode , are sampled on the internal negative edge of MCLK.  \nTable 6 describes the individual bits of the control register. The \ndifferent functions and the various output options from the AD9833  \nare described in more detail in the Frequency and Phase \nRegisters  section.  \nTo inform the AD9833 that the contents of the control register will be altered, D15 and D14 must be set to 0 as shown in Table 5 . \nTable 5.

Function of Control Bits  \n \n \nAD9833  \n \nRev. C | Page 14 of 24 Table 6. Description of Bits in the Control Register \nBit  Name  Function  \nD13  B28  Two write operations are required to load a complete word into either of the frequency registers. B28 = 1 allows a \ncomplete word to be loaded into a frequency register in tw o consecutive writes. The first write contains the 14 LSBs of \nthe frequency word, and the next write contains the 14 MS Bs. The first two bits of each 16-bit word define the \nfrequency register to which the word is loaded and should, therefore, be the same for both of the consecutive writes. \nSee Table 8 for the appropriate addresses. The write to the frequency register occurs after both words have been \nloaded; therefore, the register never holds an intermediate value. An example of a complete 28-bit write is shown in Table 9. When B28 = 0, the 28-bit frequency register operate s as two 14-bit registers, one containing the 14 MSBs and \nthe other containing the 14 LSBs. This means that the 14 MS Bs of the frequency word can be altered independent of \nthe 14 LSBs, and vice versa. To alter the 14 MSBs or the 14 LSBs, a single write is made to the appropriate frequency address. The control bit D12 (HLB) informs the AD9833 whether the bits to be altered are the 14 MSBs or 14 LSBs.  \nD12  HLB  This control bit allows the user to co ntinuously load the MSBs or LSBs of a frequency register while ignoring the \nremaining 14 bits. This is useful if the complete 28-bit reso lution is not required. HLB is used in conjunction with D13 \n(B28). This control bit indicates whether the 14 bits being load ed are being transferred to the 14 MSBs or 14 LSBs of the \naddressed frequency register. D13 (B28) must be set to 0 to be able to change the MSBs and LSBs of a frequency word \nseparately. When D13 (B28) = 1, this control bit is ignored. HLB = 1 allows a write to the 14 MSBs of the addressed frequency register. HLB = 0 allows a write to th e 14 LSBs of the addressed frequency register.  \nD11  FSELECT  The FSELECT bit defines whether the FREQ0 register or the FREQ1 register is used in the phase accumulator.  \nD10  PSELECT  The PSELECT bit defines whether the PHASE0 register or the PHAS E1 register data is added to the output of the phase \naccumulator.  \nD9  Reserved  This bit should be set to 0.  \nD8  Reset  Reset = 1 resets internal registers to 0, which corresponds to an analog output of midscale. Reset = 0 disables reset. \nThis function is explained further in Table 13.  \nD7  SLEEP1  When SLEEP1 = 1, the internal MCLK clock is disabled, an d the DAC output remains at its present value because the \nNCO is no longer accumulating. When SLEEP1 = 0, MCLK is en abled. This function is explained further in Table 14.  \nD6  SLEEP12  SLEEP12 = 1 powers down the on-chip DAC. This is usef ul when the AD9833 is used to output the MSB of the DAC data.   \nSLEEP12 = 0 implies that the DAC is active. This function is explained further in Table 14.  \nD5  OPBITEN  The function of this bit, in association with D1 (mode), is to control what is o utput at the VOUT pin. This is explained \nfurther in Table 15.  When OPBITEN = 1, the output of the DAC is no longer available at the VOUT pin. Instead, the MSB \n(or MSB/2) of the DAC data is connected to the VOUT pin. Th is is useful as a coarse clock source. The DIV2 bit controls \nwhether it is the MSB or MSB/2 that is output. When OP BITEN = 0, the DAC is connected to VOUT. The mode bit \ndetermines whether it is a sinusoidal or a ramp output that is available.  \nD4  Reserved  This bit must be set to 0.  \nD3  DIV2  DIV2 is used in association with D5 (OPB ITEN). This is explained further in Table 15. When DIV2 = 1, the MSB of the DAC \ndata is passed directly to the VOUT pin. When DIV2 = 0,  the MSB/2 of the DAC data is output at the VOUT pin.  \nD2  Reserved  This bit must be set to 0.  \nD1  Mode  This bit is used in association with OPBITEN (D5). The function of this bit is to control what is output at the VOUT pin when the on-chip DAC is connected to VOUT. This bit should be  set to 0 if the control bit OPBITEN = 1. This is explained \nfurther in Table 15. When mode = 1, the SIN ROM is bypassed, resulting in a triangle output from the DAC. When mode = 0, the SIN ROM is used to convert the phase information into am plitude information, which results in a sinusoidal signal \nat the output.  \nD0  Reserved  This bit must be set to 0.  \n   AD9833  \n \nRev.  C | Page 15 of 24 FREQUENCY AND PHASE REGISTERS  \nThe AD9833 contains two frequency re gisters and two phase \nregisters, which are described in Table 7. \nTable 7. Frequency/Phase Registers  \nRegister  Size  Description  \nFREQ0  28 bits  Frequency Register 0. When the FSELECT \nbit =  0, this register defines the output \nfrequency as a fraction of the MCLK \nfrequency.  \nFREQ1  28 bits  Frequency Register 1. When the FSELECT \nbit = 1, this register defines the output \nfrequency as a fraction of the MCLK \nfrequency.  \nPHASE0  12 bits  Phase O ffset Register 0. When the PSELECT \nbit = 0, the contents of this register are \nadded to the output of the phase \naccumulator.  \nPHASE1  12 bits  Phase Offset Register 1. When the PSELECT \nbit = 1, the contents of this register are \nadded to the output of the p hase \naccumulator.  \nThe analog output from the AD9833 is  \nfMCLK/228 × FREQREG  \nwhere FREQREG  is the value loaded into the selected frequency \nregister. This signal will be phase shifted by  \n2 π/4096 × PHASEREG  \nwhere PHASEREG  is the value contained in the selec ted phase \nregister. Consideration must be given to the relationship of the \nselected output frequency and the reference clock frequency to avoid unwanted output anomalies.  \nThe flow chart in Figure 28 shows the routine for writing to  the \nfrequency and phase registers of the AD9833.  \nWriting to a Frequency Register  \nWhen writing to a frequency register, Bit D15 and Bit D14 give \nthe address of the frequency register.  \nTable 8. Frequency Register Bits  \nD15  D14  D13  D0  \n0  1  MSB 14 FREQ0 REG b its  LSB  \n1  0  MSB 14 FREQ1 REG b its  LSB  \nIf the user wants to change the entire contents of a frequency register, two consecutive writes to the same address must be performed because  the frequency registers are 28 bits wid e. The \nfirst write contain s the 14 LSBs, and the second write c ontains \nthe 14 MSBs. For this mode of operation, the B28 (D13) control \nbit should be set to 1. An example of a 28 -bit write is shown in \nTable 9. \n \n \n Table 9.

With coarse tuning, only the 14 MSBs \nare altered, while with fine tuning, only the 14 LSBs are altered. By se tting the B28 (D13) control bit to 0, the 28 -bit frequency \nregister operates as two, 14 -bit registers, one containing the 14 MSBs  \nand the other containing the 14 LSBs. This means that the 14 MSBs  \nof the frequency word can be altered independent of the 14 L SBs, \nand vice versa. Bit HLB (D12) in the control register identifies which 14 bits are being altered.

C | Page 16 of 24 RESET  FUNCTION  \nThe reset  function resets appropriate internal registers to 0 to \nprovide an analog output of midscale. R eset does not reset the \nphase, frequency, or control registers. When the AD9833 is \npowered up, the part should be reset. To reset the AD9833, set the reset  bit to 1. To take the part out of reset, set the bit to 0. A \nsignal will appear at the DAC to output eight MCLK cycles after reset  is set to 0.  \nTable 13. Applying Reset  \nReset  Bit  Result  \n0  No reset applied  \n1  Internal registers reset  \nSLEEP FUNCTION  \nSections of the AD9833 that are not in use can be powered \ndown to minimize power consumption. This is done using the \nSLEEP function. T he parts of the chip that can be powered \ndown are the internal clock and the DAC. The bits required for the SLEEP function are outlined in Table 14. \nTable 14. Applying the SLEEP Function  \nSLEEP1 Bit  SLEEP12  Bit  Result  \n0  0  No power -down  \n0  1  DAC powered down  \n1  0  Internal clock disabled  \n1  1  Both the DAC powered down \nand the internal clock disabled  \nDAC Powered Down  \nThis is useful when the AD9833 is used to output the MSB  \nof the DAC data only.  In this case, the DAC is not required ; \ntherefore,  it can be powered down to reduce power \nconsumption.  \nInternal Clock Disabled  \nWhen the internal clock of the AD9833 is disabled, the DAC \noutput will remain at its present value because  the NCO is no \nlonger a ccumulating. New frequency, phase, and control words \ncan be written to the part when the SLEEP1 control bit is active. \nThe synchronizing clock is still active, which means that the \nselected frequency and phase registers can also be changed using the contro l bits. Setting the SLEEP1 bit to 0 enables the \nMCLK. Any changes made to the registers while SLEEP1 i s \nactive will be seen at the output after a certain latency.  VOUT PIN  \nThe AD9833 offers a variety of outputs from the chip, all of which  \nare available fro m the VOUT pin. The choice of outputs is  the \nMSB of the DAC data, a sinusoidal output, or a triangle output.  \nThe OPBITEN (D5) and mode  (D1) bits in the control register \nare used to decide which output is available from the AD9833.  \nMSB of the DAC Data  \nThe MSB of the DAC data can be output from the AD9833. By \nsetting the OPBITEN (D5) control bit to 1, the MSB of the DAC data is available at the VOUT pin. This is useful as a coarse clock source. This square wave can also be divided by two before being output . The DIV2 (D3) bit in the control register \ncontrols the frequency of this output from the VOUT pin.  \nSinusoidal Output  \nThe SIN ROM is used to convert the phase information from the frequency and phase registers into amplitude information that results in a sinusoidal signal at the output. To have a sinusoidal \noutput from the VOUT pin, set the mode  (D1) bit to 0 and the \nOPBITEN (D5) bit to 0.  \nTriangle Output  \nThe SIN ROM can be bypassed so that the truncated digital output from the NCO is sent to the DAC. In this case, the output is no longer sinusoidal. The DAC will produce a 10 -bit \nlinear triangular function. To have a triangle output from the VOUT pin, set the mode  (D1) bit = 1.  \nNote that the SLEEP12 bit must be 0 ( that is,  the DAC is enabled)  \nwhen using this pin.  \nTable 15.

C | Page 17 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nBecause of the various output options available from the part, \nthe AD9833 can be configured to suit a wide variety of applications . \nOne of the areas where the AD9833 is suitable is in mo dulation \napplications. The part can be used to perform simple modulation,  \nsuch as FSK. More complex modulation schemes, such as GMSK and QPSK, can also be implemented using the AD9833.  \nIn an FSK application, the two frequency registers of the AD9833  \nare lo aded with different values. One frequency represent s the \nspace frequency, while the other represent s the mark frequency. \nUsing the FSELECT bit in the control register of the AD9833, the \nuser can modulate the carrier frequency between the two values.  \nThe AD 9833 has two phase registers , which enables the part to \nperform PSK. With phase -shift keying, the carrier frequency is \nphase shifted, the phase being altered by an amount that is \nrelated to the bit stream being input to the modulator.  \nThe AD9833 is also suitable for signal generator applications. Because the MSB of the DAC data is available at the VOUT pin, the device can be used to generate a square wave.  \nWith its low current consumption, the part is suitable for applications in which it can be used as a l ocal oscillator.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n GROUNDING  AND LAYOUT  \nThe printed circuit board (PCB) that houses the AD9833 should  be \ndesigned so that the analog and digital sections are separated \nand confined to certain areas of the board. This facilitates the \nuse of ground  planes that can be separated easily. A minimum \netch technique is generally best for ground planes because  it gives  \nthe best shielding. Digital and analog ground planes should be joined in one place only. If the AD9833 is the only device requiring  \nan AGND -to-DGND connection, then the ground planes should  \nbe connected at the AGND and DGND pins of the AD9833. If the AD9833 is in a system where multiple devices require AGND -\nto-DGND connections, the connection should be made at one \npoint only, a star ground poi nt that should be established as \nclose as possible to the AD9833.  \nAvoid running digital lines under the device as these couple noise \nonto the die. The analog ground plane should be allowed to run under the AD9833 to avoid noise coupling. The power supply lines to the AD9833 should use as large a track as possible to provide low impedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. Fast switching signals, such as clocks, \nshould be shielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise \nto other sections of the board. Avoid crossover of digital and \nanalog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board should run at  \nright angles to each other. This reduce s the effects of feedthrough  \nthrough the board. A microstrip technique is by far the be st, but it \nis not always possible with a double -sided board. In this technique,  \nthe component side of the board is dedicated to ground planes, \nand signals are placed on the other side.  \nGood decoupling is important. The AD9833 should have supply \nbypassing o f 0.1 μF ceramic capacitors in parallel with 10 μF \ntantalum capacitors. To achieve the best from the decoupling \ncapacitors, they should be placed as close as possible to the device, ideally right up against the device.  \n \n \n \nAD9833     \n \nRev.

The device \nuses an external serial clock to write the data/control information  \ninto the device. The serial clock can have a frequency of 40 MHz  \nmaximum. The serial clock can be continuous, or it can idle  \nhigh or low between write operations. When data/control information is being written to the AD9833, FSYNC is taken \nlow and is held low while the 16 bits of data are being written \ninto the AD9833.

The ADSP -2101/ADSP -2103 is \nprogrammed through the SPORT control register and should be configured as follows:  \n• Internal clock operation (ISCLK = 1) \n• Active low framing (INVTFS = 1)  \n• 16-bit word length (SLEN = 15)  \n• Internal frame sync signal (ITFS = 1)  \n• Generate a frame sync for each write (TFSR = 1)  \nTransmission is initiated by writing a word to the Tx register after SPORT has been enabled. The data is clocked out on each rising edge of the serial clock and clocked into the AD9833 on the SCLK falling edge.  \nAD9833*\nFSYNC\nSDATA\nSCLKADSP-2101/\nADSP-2103*\nTFS\nDT\nSCLK\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.\n02704-029 \nFigure 29.

The microcontroller is \nconfigured as the master by setting bit MSTR in the SPCR to 1. \nThis provides a serial clock on SCK while the MOSI output drives the serial data line SDATA. Because  the microcontroller does \nnot have a dedicated frame sync pin, t he FSYNC signal is derived  \nfrom a port line (PC7). The setup conditions for correct operation  \nof the interface are as follows:  \n• SCK idles high between write operations (CPOL = 0)  \n• Data is valid on the SCK falling edge (CPHA = 1)  \nWhen data is being transmitte d to the AD9833, the FSYNC line is  \ntaken low (PC7). Serial data from the 68HC11/68L11 is transmitted  \nin 8-bit bytes with only eight falling clock edges occurring in \nthe transmit cycle. Data is transmitted MSB first.

The microcontroller is operated \nin Mode 0 so that TxD of the 80C51/80L51 drives  SCLK of the \nAD9833, while RxD drives the serial data line SDATA. The \nFSYNC signal is again derived from a bit programmable pin on the port (P3.3 being used in Figure 31). When data is to be \ntransmitted to the AD9833, P3.3 is take n low. The 80C51/80L51 \ntransmits data in 8 -bit bytes, thus only eight falling SCLK edges \noccur in each cycle. To load the remaining 8 bits to the AD9833, P3.3 is held low after the first 8 bits have been transmitted, and a second write operation is initiat ed to transmit the second byte \nof data. P3.3 is taken high following the completion of the second  \nwrite operation. SCLK should idle high between the two write operations. The 80C51/80L51 outputs the serial data in a format that is LSB first. The AD9833 acc epts MSB first (the 4 MSBs \nbeing the control information, the next 4 bits being the address, while the 8 LSBs contain the data when writing to a destination register). Therefore, the transmit routine of the 80C51/80L51 must take this into account and rearr ange the bits so that the \nMSB is output first.  \nAD9833*\nFSYNC\nSDATA\nSCLK80C51/80L51*\nP3.3\nRxD\nTxD\n*ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.\n02704-031 \nFigure 31. 80C51/80L51 to AD9833 Interface  AD9833 TO DSP56002 I NTERFACE  \nFigure 32 shows the interface between the AD9833 and the \nDSP56002.

The frame  \nsync signal is available on SC2, but it needs to be inverted before  \nbeing applied to the AD9833.
