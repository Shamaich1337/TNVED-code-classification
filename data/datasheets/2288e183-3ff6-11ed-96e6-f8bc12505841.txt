It is designed for balanced transmission lines and complies with ANSI TIA/EIA-485-A-1998 and ISO 8482: 1987(E). The device employs Analog Devices, Inc., iCoupler® technology to combine a 2-channel isolator, a three-\nstate differential line driver, and a differential input receiver into \na single package. \nThe differential transmitter outputs and receiver inputs feature \nelectrostatic discharge circuitry that provides protection to ±8 kV using the human body model (HBM). The logic side of the device \ncan be powered with either a 5 V or a 3 V supply, whereas the \nbus side requires an isolated 5 V supply. \nThe device has current-limiting and thermal shutdown features \nto protect against output short circuits and situations where bus \ncontention could cause excessive power dissipation. \nThe ADM2490E is available in a wide body, 16-lead SOIC package \nand operates over the −40°C to +105°C temperature range. \nADM2490E  \n \nRev.

A | Page 12 of 16 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nELECTRICAL ISOLATION \nIn the ADM2490E, electrical isolation is implemented on the \nlogic side of the interface. Therefore, the part has two main \nsections: a digital isolation section and a transceiver section  (see Figure 21 ). The driver input signal, which is applied to the \nTxD pin and referenced to logic ground (GND\n1), is coupled \nacross an isolation barrier to appear at the transceiver section referenced to isolated ground (GND\n2). Similarly, the receiver \ninput, which is referenced to isolated ground in the transceiver section, is coupled across the isolation barrier to appear at the \nRxD pin referenced to logic ground. \niCoupler Technology \nThe digital signals transmit across the isolation barrier using \niCoupler technology. This technique uses chip scale transformer \nwindings to couple the digital signals magnetically from one \nside of the barrier to the other. Digital inputs are encoded into waveforms that are capable of exciting the primary transformer winding. At the secondary winding, the induced waveforms are decoded into the binary value that was originally transmitted. \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the input cause narrow \npulses (~1 ns) to be sent to the decoder via the transformer. The \ndecoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absence of logic transitions at the input for more than ~1 μs, a periodic set of refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state are sent to \nensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no \ninternal pulses for more than about 5 μs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case the \noutput is forced to a default state (see Table 12 ).

A | Page 13 of 16 THERMAL SHUTDOWN \nThe ADM2490E contains thermal-shutdown circuitry that protects \nthe part from excessive power dissipation during fault conditions. \nShorting the driver outputs to a low impedance source can result in high driver currents. The thermal sensing circuitry detects the \nincrease in die temperature under this condition and disables \nthe driver outputs. This circuitry is designed to disable the driver outputs when a die temperature of 150°C is reached. As the device \ncools, the drivers are re-enabled at a temperature of 140°C. \nFAIL-SAFE RECEIVER INPUTS \nThe receiver inputs include a fail-safe feature that guarantees a \nlogic high on the RxD pin when the A and B inputs are floating \nor open-circuited. \nMAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY \nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the iCoupler \nis set by the condition in which an induced voltage in the receiv-\ning coil of the transformer is large enough to either falsely set or reset the decoder. The following analysis defines the conditions under which this may occur. The 3 V operating condition of  the ADM2490E is examined because it represents the most susceptible mode of operation. \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1 V . The decoder has a sensing threshold of about 0.5 V , \nthus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can \nbe tolerated.  \nThe voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by \nN n rdtdβVn , , 2 , 1 ;2K= π⎟\n⎠⎞⎜\n⎝⎛−=∑  \nwhere: \nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss). \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil. \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm). \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil and an imposed \nrequirement that the induced voltage is, at most, 50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic \nfield can be determined using Figure 22 .

Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the \nmaximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a voltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the \nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. \nSimilarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse and is the worst-case polarity, it reduces the received pulse from >1.0 V to 0.75 V , still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold  \nof the decoder. \nFigure 23  shows the magnetic flux density values in terms of \nmore familiar quantities, such as maximum allowable current \nflow at given distances away from the ADM2490E transformers. \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)1k 10k 100k 100M 1M 10MDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mmDISTANCE = 5mm1000\n100\n0.1110\n0.01MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)\n05889-011 \nFigure 23.

A | Page 14 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nISOLATED POWER SUPPLY CIRCUIT \nThe ADM2490E requires isolated power capable of 5 V at up  \nto approximately 65 mA (this current is dependent on the data \nrate and termination resistors used) to be supplied between the V\nDD2 and the GND 2 pins. A transformer driver circuit with a \ncenter-tapped transformer and LDO can be used to generate the isolated 5 V supply, as shown in Figure 25 . The center-tapped \ntransformer provides electrical isolation of the 5 V power supply. The primary winding of the transformer is excited with a pair of \nsquare waveforms that are 180° out of phase with each other. A \npair of Schottky diodes and a smoothing capacitor are used to \ncreate a rectified signal from the secondary winding. The ADP3330  \nlinear voltage regulator provides a regulated power supply to the \nbus-side circuitry (V\nDD2) of the ADM2490E. \nPCB LAYOUT \nThe ADM2490E isolated RS- 485 transceiver requires no external \ninterface circuitry for the logic interfaces. Power supply bypass-\ning is required at the input and output supply pins (see Figure 24 ). \nBypass capacitors are conveniently connected between Pin 1 \nand Pin 2 for V DD1 and between Pin 15 and Pin 16 for V DD2. The \ncapacitor value should be between 0.01 μF and 0.1 μF. The total lead length between both ends of the capacitor and the input \npower-supply pin should not exceed 20 mm. Bypassing between Pin 1 and Pin 8 and between Pin 9 and Pin 16 should also be considered unless the ground pair on each package side is connected close to the package. \nVDD1\nGND1\nRxD\nNC\nGND 1\nTxD\nNC\nGND 1VDD2\nGND2\nA\nB\nNC\nZY\nGND\n2\nNC = NO CONNECTADM2490E\n05889-013 \nFigure 24.
