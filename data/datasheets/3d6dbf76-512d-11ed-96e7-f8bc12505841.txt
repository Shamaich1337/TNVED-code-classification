To improve performance during line and load transients the device implements a constant-frequency,\npeak current-mode control which reduces output capacitance. The optimized internal compensation network\nminimizes the external component counts and simplifies the control loop design.\nThe switching frequency of the device is fixed to 400 kHz.\nThe TPS54302 device starts switching when VIN is 4.5 V. The operating current is 45 μA (typical) when not\nswitching and under no load. When the device is disabled, the supply current is 2 µA (typical).\nThe integrated 85-m Ω high-side MOSFET and 40-m Ω low-side MOSFET allow for high-efficiency power-supply\ndesigns with continuous output currents up to 3 A.\nThe TPS54302 device reduces the external component count by integrating the boot recharge diode. The bias\nvoltage for the integrated high-side MOSFET is supplied by an external capacitor on the BOOT to PH pins. The\nboot capacitor voltage is monitored by an UVLO circuit and turns off the high-side MOSFET when the voltage\nfalls below a preset threshold of 2.1 V (typical).\nThe device minimizes excessive output overvoltage transients by taking advantage of the overvoltage\ncomparator. When the regulated output voltage is greater than 108% of the nominal voltage, the overvoltage\ncomparator is activated, and the high-side MOSFET is turned off and masked from turning on until the output\nvoltage is lower than 104%.\nThe TPS54302 device has internal 5-ms soft-start time to minimize inrush currents.TPS54302\nSLVSDG6B – MAY 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54302\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nFB\nVoltage \nReferenceHS MOSFET \nCurrent \nComparator\nSlope \nCompensation\nOverload\nRecoveryMaximum\nClampOscillatorPower Stage\nand Dead Time\nControl Logic\nLS MOSFET\nCurrent LimitMaximum Clamp \nPulse SkipOvervoltage \nComparator\nBoot \nUVLO\nRegulatorVINBoot Charge\nGNDBOOT\nSW\nCurrent \nSenseCurrent \nSenseIN\nIh IpEN\nEnable \nComparatorShutdown\nLogicThermal Hiccup\nUVLO\nHiccup \nShutdown\nHiccup \nShutdown+±\n+±\n+\nSoft Start2.04 nF20 k\rError\nAmplifier\n2 pF\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Fixed-Frequency PWM Control\nThe device uses a fixed-frequency, peak current-mode control. The output voltage is compared through external\nresistors on the FB pin to an internal voltage reference by an error amplifier. An internal oscillator initiates the\nturnon of the high-side power switch. The error amplifier output is compared to the current of the high-side\npower switch. When the power-switch current reaches the error amplifier output voltage level, the high-side\npower switch is turned off and the low-side power switch is turned on. The error amplifier output voltage\nincreases and decreases as the output current increases and decreases. The device implements a current-limit\nby clamping the error amplifier voltage to a maximum level and also implements a minimum clamp for improved\ntransient-response performance.\n7.3.2 Pulse Skip Mode\nThe TPS54302 device is designed to operate in pulse-skipping mode at light-load currents to boost light-load\nefficiency. When the peak inductor current is lower than 500 mA (typical), the device enters pulse-skipping\nmode. When the device is in pulse-skipping mode, the error amplifier output voltage is clamped which prevents\nthe high-side integrated MOSFET from switching. The peak inductor current must rise above 500 mA and exitwww.ti.comTPS54302\nSLVSDG6B – MAY 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54302\npulse skip mode. Because the integrated current comparator catches the peak inductor current only, the average\nload current entering pulse-skipping mode varies with the applications and external output filters.\n7.3.3 Error Amplifier\nThe device has a transconductance amplifier as the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the FB voltage\nto the lower of the internal soft-start voltage or the internal 0.596-V voltage reference. The transconductance of\nthe error amplifier is 240 µA/V (typical). The frequency compensation components are placed internal between\nthe output of the error amplifier and ground.\n7.3.4 Slope Compensation and Output Current\nThe device adds a compensating ramp to the signal of the switch current. This slope compensation prevents\nsub-harmonic oscillations as the duty cycle increases. The available peak inductor current remains constant over\nthe full duty-cycle range.\n7.3.5 Enable and Adjusting Undervoltage Lockout\nThe EN pin provides electrical on and off control of the device. When the EN pin voltage exceeds the threshold\nvoltage, the device begins operation. If the EN pin voltage is pulled below the threshold voltage, the regulator\nstops switching and enters the low-quiescent (IQ) state.\nThe EN pin has an internal pullup-current source which allows the user to float the EN pin to enable the device.\nIf an application requires control of the EN pin, use open-drain or open-collector output logic to interface with the\npin.\nThe device implements internal undervoltage-lockout (UVLO) circuitry on the VIN pin. The device is disabled\nwhen the VIN pin voltage falls below the internal VIN UVLO threshold. The internal VIN UVLO threshold has a\nhysteresis of 480 mV.\nIf an application requires a higher UVLO threshold on the VIN pin, then the EN pin can be configured as shown\nin Figure 7-1 . When using the external UVLO function, setting the hysteresis at a value greater than 500 mV is\nrecommended.\nThe EN pin has a small pullup current, I p, which sets the default state of the pin to enable when no external\ncomponents are connected. The pullup current is also used to control the voltage hysteresis for the UVLO\nfunction because it increases by I h when the EN pin crosses the enable threshold. Use Equation 1  and Equation\n2 to calculate the values of R4 and R5 for a specified UVLO threshold.TPS54302\nSLVSDG6B – MAY 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54302\nDevice\nENIpVIN\nR4\nR5IhFigure 7-1.

During\nmonotonic prebiased startup, both high-side and low-side MOSFETs are not allowed to be turned on until the\ninternal soft-start voltage is higher than FB pin voltage.\n7.3.7 Voltage Reference\nThe voltage reference system produces a precise ±2.5% voltage-reference over temperature by scaling the\noutput of a temperature stable band-gap circuit. The typical voltage reference is designed at 0.596 V.\n7.3.8 Adjusting Output Voltage\nThe output voltage is set with a resistor divider from the output node to the FB pin. TI recommends using divider\nresistors with 1% tolerance or better. Start with 100 k Ω for the upper resistor divider, use Equation 3  to calculate\nthe output voltage. To improve efficiency at light loads consider using larger value resistors. If the values are too\nhigh the regulator is more susceptible to noise and voltage errors from the FB input current are noticeable.\nOUT refR2V V 1R3ª º  u \x0e« » ¬ ¼ \n(3)www.ti.comTPS54302\nSLVSDG6B – MAY 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54302\n7.3.9 Internal Soft-Start\nThe TPS54302 device uses the internal soft-start function. The internal soft start time is set to 5 ms (typical).\n7.3.10 Bootstrap Voltage (BOOT)\nThe TPS54302 device has an integrated boot regulator and requires a 0.1-µF ceramic capacitor between the\nBOOT and SW pins to provide the gate-drive voltage for the high-side MOSFET. A ceramic capacitor with\nan X7R or X5R grade dielectric is recommended because of the stable characteristics over temperature and\nvoltage. To improve drop out, the TPS54302 device is designed to operate at 100% duty cycle as long as the\nBOOT to SW pin voltage is greater than 2.1 V (typical).\n7.3.11 Overcurrent Protection\nThe device is protected from overcurrent conditions by cycle-by-cycle current limiting on both the high-side\nMOSFET and the low-side MOSFET.\n7.3.11.1 High-Side MOSFET Overcurrent Protection\nThe device implements current-mode control which uses the internal COMP voltage to control the turnoff of the\nhigh-side MOSFET and the turnon of the low-side MOSFET on a cycle-by-cycle basis. During each cycle, the\nswitch current and the current reference generated by the internal COMP voltage are compared. When the peak\nswitch current intersects the current reference the high-side switch turns off.\n7.3.11.2 Low-Side MOSFET Overcurrent Protection\nWhile the low-side MOSFET is turned on, the conduction current is monitored by the internal circuitry. During\nnormal operation the low-side MOSFET sources current to the load. At the end of every clock cycle, the low-side\nMOSFET sourcing current is compared to the internally set low-side sourcing current-limit. The inductor valley\ncurrent is exceeded the low-side source current limit, the high-side MOSFET does not turn on and the low-side\nMOSFET stays on for the next cycle. The high-side MOSFET turns on again when the inductor valley current is\nbelow the low-side sourcing current-limit at the start of a cycle as shown in Figure 7-2 .\nI(LIM_HS)\nI(LIM_LS)IL\nHigh-Side\nMOS FET\nLow-Side\nMOS FETSkip pulse when I L is \nhigher than I(LIM_LS)Skip pulse when I L is \nhigher than I(LIM_LS)\nt t t t\nt = 1 / f SW\nFigure 7-2.

The hiccup mode\nhelps to reduce the device power dissipation under severe overcurrent conditions.\n7.3.12 Spread Spectrum\nTo reduce EMI, the TPS54302 device introduces frequency spread spectrum. The jittering span is ±6% of the\nswitching frequency with 1/512 swing frequency.\n7.3.13 Output Overvoltage Protection (OVP)\nThe TPS54302 incorporates an overvoltage transient protection (OVTP) circuit to minimize output voltage\novershoot when recovering from output fault conditions or strong unload transients. The OVTP circuit includes\nan overvoltage comparator to compare the FB pin voltage and internal thresholds. When the FB pin voltage goes\nabove 108% × V ref, the high-side MOSFET is forced off. When the FB pin voltage falls below 104% × V ref, the\nhigh-side MOSFET is enabled again.\n7.3.14 Thermal Shutdown\nThe internal thermal-shutdown circuitry forces the device to stop switching if the junction temperature exceeds\n165°C (typical). When the junction temperature drops below 155°C (typical), the internal thermal-hiccup timer\nbegins to count. The device reinitiates the power-up sequence after the built-in thermal-shutdown hiccup time\n(32768 cycles) is over.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Normal Operation\nWhen the input voltage is above the UVLO threshold, the TPS54302 device can operate in normal switching\nmodes. Normal continuous conduction mode (CCM) occurs when inductor peak current is above 0 A. In CCM,\nthe TPS54302 device operates at a fixed frequency.\n7.4.2 Eco-mode™ Operation\nThe device is designed to operate in high-efficiency pulse-skipping mode under light-load conditions. Pulse\nskipping initiates when the switch current falls to 500 mA (typical). During pulse skipping, the low-side FET turns\noff when the switch current falls to 0 A. The switching node (the SW pin) waveform takes on the characteristics\nof discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation and the apparent switching frequency decreases. As the\noutput current decreases, the perceived time between switching pulses increases.www.ti.comTPS54302\nSLVSDG6B – MAY 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54302\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification,\nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

An additional 0.1-µF capacitor\n(C2) from the VIN pin to GND is optional to provide additional high frequency filtering. The capacitor voltage\nrating must be greater than the maximum input voltage.\nUse Equation 4  to calculate the input ripple voltage (ΔV IN).\n/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41OUT MAX\nIN MAX OUT MAX\nBULK swI /CharA0 0.25\nV I ESRC f/c180\n/c68 /c61 /c43 /c180/c180\n(4)\nwhere\n• C BULK is the bulk capacitor value.\n• f SW is the switching frequency.\n• I OUT(MAX)  is the maximum loading current.\n• ESR MAX is maximum series resistance of the bulk capacitor.\nThe maximum RMS (root mean square) ripple current must also be checked. For worst case conditions, use\nEquation 5  to calculate I CIN(RMS) .\nOUT(MAX)\nCIN(RMS)I\nI2 \n(5)\nThe actual input-voltage ripple is greatly affected by parasitic associated with the layout and the output\nimpedance of the voltage source. The Section 8.2.2  show the actual input voltage ripple for this circuit which\nis larger than the calculated value. This measured value is still below the specified input limit of 400 mV. The\nmaximum voltage across the input capacitors is V INmax + ΔV IN / 2. The selected bypass capacitor is rated for 35\nV and the ripple current capacity is greater than 2 A. Both values provide ample margin. The maximum ratings\nfor voltage and current must not be exceeded under any circumstance.\n8.2.3.2 Bootstrap Capacitor Selection\nA 0.1-µF ceramic capacitor must be connected between the BOOT to SW pin for proper operation. TI\nrecommends using a ceramic capacitor.\n8.2.3.3 Output Voltage Set Point\nThe output voltage of the TPS54302 device is externally adjustable using a resistor divider network. In the\napplication circuit of Figure 8-1 , this divider network comprises R2 and R3. Use Equation 6  and Equation 7  to\ncalculate the relationship of the output voltage to the resistor divider.\nref\nOUT refR2 VR3V V/c180/c61/c45\n(6)\nOUT refR2V V 1R3ª º  u \x0e« » ¬ ¼ \n(7)\nSelect a value of R2 to be approximately 100 k Ω. Slightly increasing or decreasing the value of R3 can result in\ncloser output voltage matching when using standard value resistors. In this design, R2 = 100 k Ω and R3 = 13.3\nkΩ which results in a 5-V output voltage. The 49.9- Ω resistor, R1, is provided as a convenient location to break\nthe control loop for stability testing.www.ti.comTPS54302\nSLVSDG6B – MAY 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54302\n8.2.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout Set Point\nThe undervoltage lockout (UVLO) set point can be adjusted using the external-voltage divider network of R4\nand R5. The R4 resistor is connected between the VIN and EN pins of the TPS54302 device. The R5 resistor\nis connected between the EN and GND pins. The UVLO has two thresholds, one for power up when the input\nvoltage is rising and one for power down or brownouts when the input voltage is falling. For the example design,\nthe minimum input voltage is 8 V, so the start voltage threshold is set to 6.74 V and the stop voltage threshold is\nset to 5.83 V. Use Equation 1  and Equation 2  to calculate the values for the upper and lower resistor values of\nR4 and R5.\n8.2.3.5 Output Filter Components\nTwo components must be selected for the output filter: the output inductor (L O) and C O.\n8.2.3.5.1 Inductor Selection\nUse Equation 8  to calculate the minimum value of the output inductor (L MIN).\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41OUT OUT IN MAX\nIND OUT sw INMIN\nMAXV V V\nV fLK I/c180 /c45\n/c61/c180 /c180 /c180\n(8)\nwhere\n• K IND is a coefficient that represents the amount of inductor ripple current relative to the maximum output\ncurrent.\nIn general, the value of K IND is at the discretion of the designer; however, the following guidelines may be used.\nFor designs using low-ESR output capacitors, such as ceramics, a higher K IND can be used. When using higher\nESR output capacitors, K IND = 0.2 yields better results.\nFor this design example, use K IND = 0.35. The minimum inductor value is calculated as 9.78 μH. For this design,\na close standard value of 10 μH was selected for L MIN.\nFor the output filter inductor, the RMS current and saturation current ratings must not be exceeded. Use\nEquation 9  to calculate the RMS inductor current ( IL(RMS) ).\n\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\n\x0b \x0c2\nOUT OUT IN MAX2\nOUT MAX\nO SW IN MAL( AX\nXM ) V V V1I12 V L f 0.8I§ · u \x10 ¨ ¸  \x0e u¨ ¸ u u u¨ ¸ © ¹ \n(9)\nUse Equation 10  to calculate the peak inductor current (I L(PK)).\n\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\x0b \x0c\n\x0b \x0cOUT OUT IN MA\nL(X\nOUT MAX\nO SW IN MAPK)\nXV V V\nI1.6 V LIfu \x10 \n \x0e u u u\n(10)\nSmaller or larger inductor values can be used depending on the amount of ripple current the designer wants to\nallow so long as the other design requirements are met. Larger value inductors have lower AC current and result\nin lower output voltage ripple. Smaller inductor values increase AC current and output voltage ripple.\n8.2.3.5.2 Output Capacitor Selection\nConsider three primary factors when selecting the value of the output capacitor. The output capacitor determines\nthe modulator pole, the output voltage ripple, and how the regulator responds to a large change in load current.\nThe output capacitance must be selected based on the more stringent of these three criteria.\nThe desired response to a large change in the load current is the first criterion. The output capacitor must supply\nthe load with current when the regulator cannot. This situation occurs if the desired hold-up times are present forTPS54302\nSLVSDG6B – MAY 2016 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS54302\nthe regulator. In this case, the output capacitor must hold the output voltage above a certain level for a specified\namount of time after the input power is removed. The regulator is also temporarily unable to supply sufficient\noutput current if a large, fast increase occurs affecting the current requirements of the load, such as a transition\nfrom no load to full load. The regulator usually requires two or more clock cycles for the control loop to notice\nthe change in load current and output voltage and to adjust the duty cycle to react to the change. The output\ncapacitor must be sized to supply the extra current to the load until the control loop responds to the load change.\nThe output capacitance must be large enough to supply the difference in current for 2 clock cycles while only\nallowing a tolerable amount of drop in the output voltage. Use Equation 11  to calculate the minimum required\noutput capacitance.\nOUT\nO\nsw OUT2 I Cf V u\'!u\'\n(11)\nwhere\n• ∆I OUT is the change in output current.\n• f SW is the switching frequency of the regulator.\n• ∆V OUTb is the allowable change in the output voltage.\nFor this example, the transient load response is specified as a 5% change in the output voltage, V OUT, for a load\nstep of 1.5 A. For this example, ΔIOUT = 1.5 A and ΔVOUT = 0.05 × 5 = 0.25 V. Using these values results in\na minimum capacitance of 30 μF. This value does not consider the ESR of the output capacitor in the output\nvoltage change. For ceramic capacitors, the ESR is usually small enough to ignore in this calculation.\nUse Equation 12  to calculate the minimum output capacitance required to meet the output voltage ripple\nspecification. In this case, the maximum output voltage ripple is 30 mV. Under this requirement, Equation 12\nyields 10.7 μF.\nO\nOUTripple SW\nripple1 1CV 8 f\nI/c180/c62 /c180\n(12)\nwhere\n• ƒ SW is the switching frequency.\n• V OUTripple  is the maximum allowable output voltage ripple.\n• I ripple is the inductor ripple current\nUse Equation 13  to calculate the maximum ESR an output capacitor can have to meet the output-voltage ripple\nspecification. Equation 13  indicates the ESR should be less than 29.2 m Ω. In this case, the ESR of the ceramic\ncapacitor is much smaller than 29.2 mΩ.\nOUTripple\nESR\nrippleV\nRI/c60\n(13)\nThe output capacitor can affect the crossover frequency f o. Considering the loop stability and effect of the\ninternal parasitic parameters, choose the crossover frequency less than 40 kHz without considering the feed\nforward capacitor. A simple estimation for the crossover frequency without feed forward capacitor C6 is shown in\nEquation 14 , assuming C O has small ESR.\no\nOUT O5.1f = V Cu\n(14)\nAdditional capacitance deratings for aging, temperature, and DC bias should be considered which increases\nthis minimum value. For this example, two 22-uF 25-V, X7R ceramic capacitors are used. Capacitors generally\nhave limits to the amount of ripple current they can handle without failing or producing excess heat.

Some capacitor data sheets specify the\nRMS value of the maximum ripple current. Use Equation 15  to calculate the RMS ripple current that the output\ncapacitor must support.

Depending on the V OUT, if the output capacitor C OUT is\ndominated by low ESR (ceramic types) capacitors, it could result in low phase margin. To improve the phase\nboost an external feedforward capacitor C6 can be added in parallel with R2. The C6 capacitor is chosen such\nthat phase margin is boosted at the crossover frequency.\nEquation 16  for C6 was tested.\no1 1 C6 = 2 f R2uS\n(16)\nFor this design, C6 = 75 pF. The C6 capacitor is not needed when C OUT has high ESR, and C6 calculated from\nEquation 16  should be reduced with medium ESR.
