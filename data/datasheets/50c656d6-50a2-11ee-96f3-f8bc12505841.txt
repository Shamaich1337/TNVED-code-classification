Its versatile\nthree-op amp design and very small size make it ideal\nfor a variety of general purpose applications. Low bias\ncurrent ( ±4pA) allows use with high impedance\nsources.\nGain can be set from 1V to 10,000V/V with a single\nexternal resistor. Internal input protection can with-\nstand up to ±40V without damage.\nThe INA121 is laser-trimmed for very low offset\nvoltage (±200µV), low offset drift ( ±2µV/°C), and\nhigh common-mode rejection (106dB at G = 100). It\noperates on power supplies as low as ±2.25V (+4.5V),\nallowing use in battery operated and single 5V sys-\ntems. Quiescent current is only 450 µA.\nPackage options include 8-pin plastic DIP and SO-8\nsurface mount.

Applications with noisy or high impedance\npower supplies may require decoupling capacitors close to\nthe device pins as shown.\nThe output is referred to the output reference (Ref) terminal\nwhich is normally grounded. This must be a low-impedance\nconnection to assure good common-mode rejection. A resis-\ntance of 8 Ω in series with the Ref pin will cause a typical\ndevice to degrade to approximately 80dB CMR (G = 1).\nSETTING THE GAIN\nGain of the INA121 is set by connecting a single external\nresistor, RG, connected between pins 1 and 8:\nCommonly used gains and resistor values are shown in\nFigure 1.(1)\nG=1+50kΩ\nRGThe 50kΩ term in Equation 1 comes from the sum of the two\ninternal feedback resistors of A1 and A2. These on-chip\nmetal film resistors are laser trimmed to accurate absolute\nvalues. The accuracy and temperature coefficient of these\nresistors are included in the gain accuracy and drift specifi-\ncations of the INA121.\nThe stability and temperature drift of the external gain\nsetting resistor, RG, also affects gain. RG’s contribution to\ngain accuracy and drift can be directly inferred from the gain\nequation (1). Low resistor values required for high gain can\nmake wiring resistance important. Sockets add to the wiring\nresistance which will contribute additional gain error (possi-\nbly an unstable gain error) in gains of approximately 100 or\ngreater.\nDYNAMIC PERFORMANCE\nThe typical performance curve “Gain vs Frequency” shows\nthat, despite its low quiescent current, the INA121 achieves\nwide bandwidth, even at high gain. This is due to the\ncurrent-feedback topology of the INA121. Settling time also\nremains excellent at high gain.\nA1\nA2A36\n40kΩ 40kΩ40kΩ 40kΩ7\n43812VIN\nVINRGV+\nV–INA121\nG = 1 +50kΩ\nRG–\n+5Over-Voltage\nProtection\n25kΩ\n25kΩ\nOver-Voltage\nProtectionLoadVO = G • (VIN – VIN)+–0.1µF\n0.1µF+\n–VO\nRGAlso drawn in simplified form:\nINA121\nRefVOVIN–\nVIN+RefDESIRED RGNEAREST 1% RG\nGAIN ( Ω)( Ω)\n1N C N C\n2 50.00k 49.9k\n5 12.50k 12.4k\n10 5.556k 5.62k\n20 2.632k 2.61k50 1.02k 1.02k\n100 505.1 511\n200 251.3 249500 100.2 100\n1000 50.05 49.9\n2000 25.01 24.9\n5000 10.00 10\n10000 5.001 4.99\nNC: No Connection.\nFIGURE 1.

The typical performance curve,\n“Common-Mode Rejection vs Frequency” shows this be-\nhavior. If the inputs are not properly balanced, however,\ncommon-mode signals can be converted to differential sig-\nnals. Run the VIN and VIN connections directly adjacent each\nother, from the source signal all the way to the input pins. If\npossible use a ground plane under both input traces. Avoid\nrunning other potentially noisy lines near the inputs.\nNOISE AND ACCURACY PERFORMANCE\nThe INA121’s FET input circuitry provides low input bias\ncurrent and high speed. It achieves lower noise and higher\naccuracy with high impedance sources. With source imped-\nances of 2k Ω to 50kΩ the INA114, INA128, or INA129 may\nprovide lower offset voltage and drift. For very low source\nimpedance ( ≤1kΩ), the INA103 may provide improved\naccuracy and lower noise. At very high source impedances\n(> 1MΩ) the INA116 is recommended.\nOFFSET TRIMMING\nThe INA121 is laser trimmed for low offset voltage and\ndrift. Most applications require no external offset adjust-\nment. Figure 2 shows an optional circuit for trimming the\noutput offset voltage. The voltage applied to Ref terminal is\nsummed at the output. The op amp buffer provides low\nimpedance at the Ref terminal to preserve good common-\nmode rejection. Trim circuits with higher source impedance\nshould be buffered with an op amp follower circuit to assure\nlow impedance on the Ref pin.Input circuitry must provide a path for this input bias current\nif the INA121 is to operate properly. Figure 3 shows various\nprovisions for an input bias current path. Without a bias\ncurrent return path, the inputs will float to a potential which\nexceeds the common-mode range of the INA121 and the\ninput amplifiers will saturate.\nIf the differential source resistance is low, the bias current\nreturn path can be connected to one input (see the thermo-\ncouple example in Figure 3). With higher source impedance,\nusing two resistors provides a balanced input with possible\nadvantages of lower input offset voltage due to bias current\nand better high-frequency common-mode rejection.+ –\nINPUT BIAS CURRENT RETURN PATH\nThe input impedance of the INA121 is extremely high—\napproximately 1012Ω. However, a path must be provided for\nthe input bias current of both inputs. This input bias current\nis typically 4pA. High input impedance means that this input\nbias current changes very little with varying input voltage.INA121VIN\nVINRG–\n+\n10kΩ(1)VO\nOPA277Ref\n±10mV\nAdjustment Range100Ω(1)\n100Ω(1)100µA\n1/2 REF200\n100µA\n1/2 REF200V+\nV–NOTE: (1) For wider trim range required\nin high gains, scale resistor values larger\nINPUT COMMON-MODE RANGE\nThe linear input voltage range of the input circuitry of the\nINA121 is from approximately 1.2V below the positive\nsupply voltage to 2.1V above the negative supply. A differ-\nential input voltage causes the output voltage to increase.\nThe linear input range, however, will be limited by the\noutput voltage swing of amplifiers A1 and A2. So the linear\ncommon-mode input range is related to the output voltage of\nthe complete amplifier. This behavior also depends on sup-\nply voltage—see typical performance curve “Input Com-\nmon-Mode Range vs Output Voltage”.FIGURE 3. Providing an Input Common-Mode Current Path.\nFIGURE 2.

Figure\n4 shows the output voltage swing of A1 and A2 expressed in\nterms of a common-mode and differential input voltages.\nFor applications where input common-mode range must be\nmaximized, limit the output voltage swing by connecting the\nINA121 in a lower gain (see performance curve “Input\nCommon-Mode Voltage Range vs Output Voltage”). If\nnecessary, add gain after the INA121 to increase the voltage\nswing.\nInput-overload can produce an output voltage that appears\nnormal. For example, if an input overload condition drives\nboth input amplifiers to their positive output swing limit, the\ndifference voltage measured by the output amplifier will be\nnear zero. The output of A3 will be near 0V even though both\ninputs are overloaded.\nLOW VOLTAGE OPERATION\nThe INA121 can be operated on power supplies as low as\n±2.25V. Performance remains excellent with power supplies\nranging from ±2.25V to ±18V. Most parameters vary only\nslightly throughout this supply voltage range—see typicalperformance curves. Operation at very low supply voltage\nrequires careful attention to assure that the input voltages\nremain within their linear range. Voltage swing requirements\nof internal nodes limit the input common-mode range with low\npower supply voltage. Typical performance curves, “Input\nCommon-Mode Range vs Output Voltage” show the range of\nlinear operation for ±15V, ±5V, and ±2.5V supplies.\nINPUT FILTERING\nThe INA121’s FET input allows use of an R/C input filter\nwithout creating large offsets due to input bias current.\nFigure 5 shows proper implementation of this input filter to\npreserve the INA121’s excellent high frequency common-\nmode rejection. Mismatch of the common-mode input time\nconstant (R1C1 and R2C2), either from stray capacitance or\nmismatched values, causes a high frequency common-mode\nsignal to be converted to a differential signal. This degrades\ncommon-mode rejection. The differential input capacitor,\nC3, reduces the bandwidth and mitigates the effects of\nmismatch in C1 and C2. Make C3 much larger than C1 and\nC2. If properly matched, C1 and C2 also improve ac CMR.\nFIGURE 4. Voltage Swing of A1 and A2.\nFIGURE 5. Input Low-Pass Filter. FIGURE 6.
