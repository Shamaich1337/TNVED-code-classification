It is pin- and register-compatible with the ADM1032. The\nADT7461 has three additional features: series resistance cancellation\n(where up to 3 k /C0087 (typical) of resistance in series with the temperature\nmonitoring diode may be automatica lly cancelled from the temperature\nresult, allowing noise filtering); configurable ALERT  output; and an\nextended, switchable temperature measurement range. The ADT7461\ncan accurately measure the temperature of a remote thermal diode to±1°C and the ambient temperature to ±3°C. The temperature\nmeasurement range defaults to 0 °C to +127 °C, compatible with the\nADM1032, but can be switched to a wider measurement range of −55°C\nto +150 °C. The ADT7461 communicates over a 2-wire serial interface\ncompatible with system management bus (SMBus) standards. An\nALERT\n output signals when the on-chip or remote temperature is out of\nrange. The THERM  output is a comparator output that allows on/off\ncontrol of a cooling fan. The ALERT  output can be reconfigured as a\nsecond THERM  output, if required.\nThe SMBus address of the ADT7461 is 0x4C.\nFeatures\n•On-Chip and Remote Temperature Sensor\n•0.25°C Resolution/1 °C Accuracy on Remote Channel\n•1°C Resolution/3 °C Accuracy on Local Channel\n•Automatically Cancels Up to 3 k /C0087 (Typ) of Resistance in Series with\nRemote Diode to Allow Noise Filtering\n•Extended, Switchable Temperature Measurement Range\n0°C to +127 °C (Default) or –55 °C to +150 °C\n•Pin- and Register-Compatible with the ADM1032\n•2-wire SMBus Serial Interface with SMBus Alert Support\n•ADT7461 SMBus Address is 0x4C\n•Programmable Over/Undertemperature Limits\n•Offset Registers for System Calibration\n•Up to Two Overtemperature Fail −Safe THERM  Outputs\n•Small 8-lead SOIC NB or 8-lead MSOP Packages\n•170/C0109A Operating Current, 5.5 /C0109A Standby Current\n•These are Pb-Free Devices*\nApplications\n•Desktop and Notebook Computers\n•Industrial Controllers\n•Smart Batteries\n•Embedded Systems\n•Instrumentation\n*For additional information on our Pb −Free strategy and soldering details, please download the onsemi  Soldering and Mounting Techniques\nReference Manual, SOLDERRM/D.MARKING DIAGRAMSPIN ASSIGNMENTSOIC−8 NB\nCASE 751\nADT74\n61A\n#YWW\n18\nADT7461A = Specific Device Code\n# = Pb-Free Package\nY = YearW = Work Week\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information in the package\ndimensions section on page 18 of this data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATIONT1x = Refer to Order Info Table\nA = Assembly Location\nY = YearW = Work Week\n/C0071 = Pb-Free Package\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)18\nT1x\nAYW /C0071\n/C0071MSOP8\nCASE 846AB\n(Top View)SCLK\nSDATA\nALERT /THERM2\nGNDD+\nD−\nTHERMVDD8\n7\n6\n51\n2\n3\n4\nSOIC−8\nMSOP8\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n2Figure 1.

The analog input\nmultiplexer alternately selects either the on-chiptemperature sensor to measure its local temperature or theremote temperature sensor. The ADC digitizes these signals\nand the results are stored in the local and remote temperaturevalue registers.\nThe local and remote measurement results are compared\nwith the corresponding high, low, and THERM\n temperature\nlimits, stored in eight on-chip registers. Out-of-limit\ncomparisons generate flags that are stored in the status register.A result that exceeds the high temperature limit, the lowtemperature limit, or an external diode fault causes the ALERT\noutput to assert low. Exceeding THERM  temperature limits\ncauses the THERM  output to assert low. The ALERT  output\ncan be reprogrammed as a second THERM  output.\nThe limit registers can be programmed and the device\ncontrolled and configured via the serial SMBus. The\ncontents of any register can also be read back via the SMBus.\nControl and configuration functions consist of switching\nthe device between normal operation and standby mode,selecting the temperature measurement scale, masking orenabling the ALERT\n output, switching Pin 6 between\nALERT  and THERM2 , and selecting the conversion rate.\nSeries Resistance Cancellation\nParasitic resistance to the D+ and D − inputs to the\nADT7461, seen in series with the remote diode, is caused bya variety of factors, including PCB track resistance and tracklength. This series resistance appears as a temperature offsetin the remote sensor’s temperature measurement. This error\ntypically causes a 0.5 °C offset per ohm of parasitic resistance\nin series with the remote diode.\nThe ADT7461 automatically cancels out the effect of this\nseries resistance on the temperature reading, giving a moreaccurate result, without the need for user characterization of\nthis resistance. The ADT7461 is designed to automatically\ncancel typically up to 3 k /C0087 of resistance. By using an\nadvanced temperature measurement method, this is\ntransparent to the user. This feature allows resistances to be\nadded to the sensor path to produce a filter, allowing the part\nto be used in noisy environments. See the Noise Filteringsection for more details.Temperature Measurement Method\nA simple method of measuring temperature is to exploit\nthe negative temperature coef ficient of a diode by measuring\nthe base-emitter voltage (V BE) of a transistor operated at\nconstant current. However, this technique requirescalibration to null out the ef fect of the absolute value of V\nBE,\nwhich varies from device to device.\nThe technique used in the ADT7461 is to measure the\nchange in V BE when the device is operated at three dif ferent\ncurrents. Previous devices have used only two operatingcurrents, but it is the use of a third current that allowsautomatic cancellation of resistances in series with theexternal temperature sensor.\nFigure 15 shows the input signal conditioning used to\nmeasure the output of an external temperature sensor. This\nfigure shows the external sensor as a substrate transistor, but\nit could equally be a discrete transistor. If a discretetransistor is used, the collector will not be grounded andshould be linked to the base. To prevent ground noiseinterfering with the measurement, the more negativeterminal of the sensor is not referenced to ground, but isbiased above ground by an internal diode at the D − input. C1\nmay be added as a noise filter (a recommended maximum\nvalue of 1,000 pF). However, a better option in noisyenvironments is to add a filter, as described in the NoiseFiltering section. See the Layout Considerations section for\nmore information on C1.\nTo measure /C0068V\nBE, the operating current through the\nsensor is switched among three related currents. Figure 15shows N1 ×I and N2 ×I as different multiples of the\ncurrent, I. The currents through the temperature diode are\nswitched between I and N1 ×I, giving /C0068V\nBE1, and then\nbetween I and N2 ×I, giving /C0068VBE2. The temperature may\nthen be calculated using the two /C0068VBE measurements. This\nmethod can also be shown to cancel the effect of any seriesresistance on the temperature measurement.\nThe resulting /C0068V\nBE waveforms are passed through a\n65 kHz low-pass filter to remove noise and then to a\nchopper-stabilized amplifier. This amplifies and rectifies the\nwaveform to produce a dc voltage proportional to /C0068VBE. The\nADC digitizes this voltage and a temperature measurement isproduced. To reduce the effects of noise, digital filtering isperformed by averaging the results of 16 measurement cyclesfor low conversion rates. At rates of 16, 32, and 64conversions per second, no digital averaging takes place.\nSignal conditioning and measurement of the internal\ntemperature sensor is performed in the same manner.\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n8Figure 15.

IT SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN NOISY ENVIRONMENTS.\nTemperature Measurement Results\nThe results of the local and remote temperature\nmeasurements are stored in the local and remote temperature\nvalue registers and are compared with limits programmedinto the local and remote high and low limit registers.\nThe local temperature value is in Register 0x00 and has a\nresolution of 1 °C. The external temperature value is stored in\ntwo registers, with the upper byte in Register 0x01 and thelower byte in Register 0x10. Only the two MSBs in the externaltemperature low byte are used. This gives the externaltemperature measurement a resolution of 0.25 °C. Table 6\nshows the data format for the external temperature low byte.\nTable 6. EXTENDED TEMPERATURE RESOLUTION\n(REMOTE TEMPERATURE LOW BYTE)\nExtended ResolutionRemote Temperature\nLow Byte\n0.00 °C 0 000 0000\n0.25 °C 0 100 0000\n0.50 °C 1 000 0000\n0.75 °C 1 100 0000\nWhen reading the full external temperature value, both the\nhigh and low byte, the two registers should be read insuccession. Reading one register does not lock the other, so\nboth should be read before the next conversion finishes. Inpractice, there is more than enough time to read both\nregisters, as transactions over the SMBus are significantly\nfaster than a conversion time.\nTemperature Measurement Range\nThe temperature measurement range for both internal and\nexternal measurements is, by default, 0 °C to +127 °C.\nHowever, the ADT7461 can be operated using an extended\ntemperature range. It can measure the full temperature rangeof an external diode, from −55°C to +150 °C. The user can\nswitch between these two temperature ranges by setting orclearing Bit 2 in the configuration register. A valid result is\navailable in the next measurement cycle after changing the\ntemperature range.\nIn extended temperature mode, the upper and lower\ntemperature that can be measured by the ADT7461 islimited by the remote diode selection. The temperatureregisters themselves can have values from −64°C to +191 °C.\nHowever, most temperature sensing diodes have amaximum temperature range of −55°C to +150 °C.\nAbove 150 °C, they may lose their semiconductor\ncharacteristics and approximate conductors instead. Thisresults in a diode short. In this case, a read of the temperature\nresult register gives the last good temperature measurement.\nThe user should be aware that the temperature measurementon the external channel may not be accurate for temperatures\nthat are outside the operating range of the remote sensor.\nWhile both local and remote temperature measurements\ncan be made while the part is in extended temperature mode,\nthe ADT7461 itself should not be exposed to temperaturesgreater than those specified in the Absolute MaximumRatings section. Also, the device is guaranteed to operate onlyas specified at ambient temperatures from −40°C to +120 °C.\nTemperature Data Format\nThe ADT7461 has two temperature data formats. When the\ntemperature measurement range is from 0 °C to +127 °C\n(default), the temperature data format for both internal andexternal temperature results is binary. When the measurementrange is in extended mode, an offset binary data format is usedfor both internal and external results. Temperature values inthe offset binary data format are offset by 64 °C. Examples of\ntemperatures in both data formats are shown in Table 7.\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n9Table 7.

Offset binary scale temperature values are offset by 64 °C.\n2. Binary scale temperature measurement returns 0 °C for all\ntemperatures < 0 °C.\n3. Binary scale temperature measurement returns 127 °C for all\ntemperatures > 127 °C.\nThe user can switch between measurement ranges at any\ntime. Switching the range also switches the data format. The\nnext temperature result following the switching is reported\nback to the register in the new format. However, the\ncontents of the limit registers are not changed. The user must\nensure that the limit registers are reprogrammed, as\nnecessary, when the data format changes. See the LimitRegisters section for more \ninformation.\nADT7461 Registers\nThe ADT7461 contains a total of 22 8-bit registers. These\nregisters are used to store the results of remote and localtemperature measurements and high and low temperaturelimits and to configure and control the device. A description\nof these registers follows. Additional details are provided inTable 8 to Table 12.\nAddress Pointer Register\nThe address pointer register does not have or require an\naddress, as the first byte of every write operation isautomatically written to this register. The data in this firstbyte always contains the address of another register on theADT7461, which is stored in the address pointer register.This register address is written to by the second byte of a\nwrite operation or is used for a subsequent read operation.\nThe power-on default value of the address pointer register\nis 0x00. Therefore, if a read operation is performedimmediately after power-on, without first writing to theaddress pointer, the value of the local temperature isreturned, since its register address is 0x00.\nTemperature Value Registers\nThe ADT7461 has three registers to store the results of\nlocal and remote temperature measurements. Theseregisters can only be written to by the ADC and can be read\nby the user over the SMBus. The local temperature valueregister is at Address 0x00.\nThe external temperature value high byte register is at\nAddress 0x01, with the low byte register at Address 0x10.The power-on default for all three registers is 0x00.\nConfiguration Register\nThe configuration register is Address 0x03 at read and\nAddress 0x09 at write. Its power-on default is 0x00. Only\nfour bits of the configuration register are used. Bits 0, 1, 3,and 4 are reserved and should not be written to by the user.\nBit 7 of the configuration register is used to mask the\nALERT\n output. If Bit 7 is 0, the ALERT  output is enabled.\nThis is the power-on default. If Bit 7 is set to 1, the ALERT\noutput is disabled. This only applies if Pin 6 is configured as\nALERT . If Pin 6 is configured as THERM2 , the value of\nBit 7 has no effect.\nIf Bit 6 is set to 0 (the power-on default), the device is in\noperating mode with the ADC converting. If Bit 6 is set to1, the device is in standby mode and the ADC does notconvert. The SMBus does, however, remain active instandby mode, so values can be read from or written to theADT7461 via the SMBus in this mode. The ALERT\n and\nTHERM  outputs are also active in standby mode. Changes\nmade to the registers in standby mode that affect the\nTHERM  or ALERT  outputs cause these signals to be\nupdated.\nBit 5 determines the configuration of Pin 6 on the\nADT7461. If Bit 5 is 0 (default), then Pin 6 is configured as\nan ALERT  output. If Bit 5 is 1, then Pin 6 is configured as\na THERM2  output. Bit 7, the ALERT  mask bit, is only\nactive when Pin 6 is configured as an ALERT  output. If\nPin 6 is set up as a THERM2  output, then Bit 7 has no ef fect.\nBit 2 sets the temperature measurement range. If Bit 2 is\n0 (default), the temperature measurement range is setbetween 0 °C to +127 °C. Setting Bit 2 to 1 means that the\nmeasurement range is set to the extended temperature range.\nTable 8.

The lowest four bits of this registerare used to program the conversion rate by dividing theinternal oscillator clock by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,512, or 1024 to give conversion times from 15.5 ms (Code\n0x0A) to 16 seconds (Code 0x00). For example, a\nconversion rate of 8 conversions per second means thatbeginning at 125 ms intervals; the device performs aconversion on the internal and external temperaturechannels.\nThis register can be written to and read back over the\nSMBus. The higher four bits of this register are unused and\nmust be set to 0. The default value of this register is 0x08,\ngiving a rate of 16 conversions per second. Use of slower\nconversion times greatly reduces the device powerconsumption, as shown in Table 9.\nTable 9.

The remote temperature highand low limits span two registers each to contain an upper\nand lower byte for each limit. There is also a THERM\nhysteresis register. All limit registers can be written to and\nread back over the SMBus. See T able 13 for address details\nof the limit registers and their power-on default values.\nWhen Pin 6 is configured as an ALERT  output, the high\nlimit registers perform a > comparison while the low limitregisters perform a ≤ comparison. For example, if the high\nlimit register is programmed with 80 °C, then measuring\n81°C results in an out-of-limit condition, setting a flag in the\nstatus register. If the low limit register is programmed with0°C, measuring 0 °C or lower results in an out-of-limit\ncondition.\nExceeding either the local or remote THERM\n limit asserts\nTHERM  low. When Pin 6 is configured as THERM2 ,exceeding either the local or remote high limit asserts\nTHERM2  low. A default hysteresis value of 10 °C is\nprovided that applies to both THERM  channels. This\nhysteresis value may be reprogrammed to any value after\npowerup (Register Address 0x21).\nIt is important to remember that the temperature limits\ndata format is the same as the temperature measurement data\nformat. So, if the temperature measurement uses defaultbinary, the temperature limits also use the binary scale. If the\ntemperature measurement scale is switched, however, thetemperature limits do not switch automatically. The user\nmust reprogram the limit registers to the desired value in the\ncorrect data format. For example, if the remote low limit isset at 10 °C and the default binary scale is being used, the\nlimit register value should be 0000 1010b. If the scale isswitched to offset binary, the value in the low temperaturelimit register should be reprogrammed to be 0100 1010b.\nStatus Register\nThe status register is a read-only register  at Address 0x02.\nIt contains status information for the ADT7461.\nBit 7 of the status register indicates the ADC is busy\nconverting when it is high. The other bits in this register flag\nthe out-of-limit temperature measurements (Bits 6 to 3 andBits 1 to 0) and the remote sensor open circuit (Bit 2).\nIf Pin 6 is configured as an ALERT\n output, the following\napplies. If the local temperature measurement exceeds itslimits, Bit 6 (high limit) or Bit 5 (low limit) of the statusregister asserts to flag this condition. If the remotetemperature measurement exceeds its limits, then Bit 4(high limit) or Bit 3 (low limit) asserts. Bit 2 asserts to flagan open-circuit condition on the remote sensor. These fiveflags are NOR’d together so if any of them is high, the\nALERT\n interrupt latch is set and the ALERT  output goes\nlow.\nReading the status register clears the five flags, Bits 6 to 2,\nprovided the error conditions causing the flags to be set havegone away. A flag bit can be reset only if the correspondingvalue register contains an in-limit measurement or if thesensor is good.\nThe ALERT\n interrupt latch is not reset by reading the\nstatus register. It resets when the ALERT  output has been\nserviced by the master reading the device address, provided\nthe error condition has gone away and the status register flagbits are reset.\nWhen Flag 1 and/or Flag 0 are set, the THERM\n output\ngoes low to indicate the temperature measurements areoutside the programmed limits. The THERM\n output does\nnot need to be reset, unlike the ALERT  output. Once the\nmeasurements are within the limits, the corresponding status\nregister bits are reset automatically and the THERM  output\ngoes high. The user may add hysteresis by programmingRegister 0x21. The THERM\n output is reset only when the\ntemperature falls to limit value minus hysteresis value.\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n11When Pin 6 is configured as THERM2 , only the high\ntemperature limits are relevant. If Flag 6 and/or Flag 4 areset, the THERM2\n output goes low to indicate the\ntemperature measurements are outside the programmed\nlimits. Flag 5 and Flag 3 have no effect on THERM2 . The\nbehavior of THERM2  is otherwise the same as THERM .\nTable 10.

Polling of the BUSY bit is not recommended.\n2. These flags stay high until the status register is read or they are\nreset by POR.\nOffset Register\nOffset errors may be introduced into the remote\ntemperature measurement by clock noise or by the thermaldiode being located away from the hot spot. To achieve thespecified accuracy on this channel, these offsets must beremoved.\nThe offset value is stored as a 10-bit, twos complement\nvalue in Registers 0x11 (high byte) and 0x12 (low byte, left\njustified). Only the upper 2 bits of Register 0x12 are used.The MSB of Register 0x11 is the sign bit. The minimumoffset that can be programmed is −128°C, and the maximum\nis +127.75 °C. The value in the offset register is added to the\nmeasured value of the remote temperature.\nThe offset register powers up with a default value of 0 °C\nand has no effect unless the user  writes a different value to it.Table 11.

Writing to theone-shot register address (0x0F) causes the ADT7461 toperform a conversion and comparison on both the internal\nand the external temperature channels. This is not a data\nregister as such; the write operation to Address 0x0F causes\nthe one-shot conversion. The data written to this address isirrelevant and is not stored.\nConsecutive ALERT  Register\nThe value written to this register determines how many\nout-of-limit measurements must occur before an ALERT  is\ngenerated. The default value is that one out-of-limitmeasurement generates an ALERT\n. The maximum value that\ncan be chosen is 4. The purpose of this register is to allow theuser to perform some filtering of the output. This isparticularly useful at the fastest three conversion rates, where\nno averaging takes place. This register is at Address 0x22.\nTable 12.

Writing to Address ox0F causes the ADT7461 to perform a single measurement. It is not a data register, therefore, data writte n to it is\nirrelevant.\nSerial Bus Interface\nControl of the ADT7461 is carried out via the serial bus.\nThe ADT7461 is connected to this bus as a slave device,under the control of a master device.\nAfter a conversion sequence completes, there should be\nno SMBus transactions to the ADT7461 for at least one\nconversion time, to allow the next conversion to complete.\nThe conversion time depends on the value programmed inthe conversion rate register.\nThe ADT7461 has an SMBus timeout feature. When this\nis enabled, the SMBus times out typically after 25 ms ofinactivity. However, this feature is not enabled by default.Bit 7 of the consecutive alert register (Address = 0x22)should be set to enable it.\nConsult the SMBus 1.1 specification for more\ninformation ( www.smbus.org\n).\nAddressing the Device\nIn general, every SMBus device has a 7-bit device\naddress, except for some devices that have extended 10-bit\naddresses. When the master device sends a device address\nover the bus, the slave device with that address responds.The ADT7461 is available with one device address, 0x4C(1001 100b).The serial bus protocol operates as follows:\n1. The master initiates data transfer by establishing a\nstart condition, defined as a high-to-low transition\non the serial data line SDATA, while the serial\nclock line SCLK remains high. This indicates thatan address/data stream will follow. All slaveperipherals connected to the serial bus respond tothe start condition and shift in the next eight bits,consisting of a 7-bit address (MSB first) plus anR/W\n bit, which determines the direction of the\ndata transfer, that is, whether data will be written\nto or read from the slave device. The peripheral\nwhose address corresponds to the transmittedaddress responds by pulling the data line lowduring the low period before the ninth clock pulse,known as the acknowledge bit. All other deviceson the bus now remain idle while the selecteddevice waits for data to be read from or written toit. If the R/W\n bit is a 0, the master writes to the\nslave device. If the R/W  bit is a 1, the master reads\nfrom the slave device.\n2. Data is sent over the serial bus in a sequence of\nnine clock pulses, eight bits of data followed by anacknowledge bit from the slave device. Transitionson the data line must occur during the low period\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n13of the clock signal and remain stable during the\nhigh period, since a low-to-high transition whenthe clock is high may be interpreted as a stop\nsignal. The number of data bytes that can be\ntransmitted over the serial bus in a single read orwrite operation is limited only by what the masterand slave devices can handle.\n3. When all data bytes have been read or written,\nstop conditions are established. In write mode, themaster pulls the data line high during the tenthclock pulse to assert a stop condition. In read\nmode, the master device overrides the\nacknowledge bit by pulling the data line highduring the low period before the ninth clock pulse.This is known as a no acknowledge. The masterthen takes the data line low during the low periodbefore the tenth clock pulse, then high during thetenth clock pulse to assert a stop condition.\nAny number of bytes of data may be transferred over the\nserial bus in one operation, but it is not possible to mix readand write in one operation because the type of operation is\ndetermined at the beginning and cannot subsequently bechanged without starting a new operation. With the\nADT7461, write operations contain either one or two bytes,\nwhile read operations contain one byte.\nTo write data to one of the device data registers or to read\ndata from it, the address pointer register must be set so thatthe correct data register is addressed. The first byte of a write\noperation always contains a valid address that is stored in theaddress pointer register. If data is to be written to the device,\nthe write operation contains a second data byte that is written\nto the register selected by the address pointer register.\nThis is illustrated in Figure 16. The device address is sent\nover the bus followed by R/W\n set to 0. This is followed by two\ndata bytes. The first data byte is the address of the internal dataregister to be written to, which is stored in the address pointerregister. The second data byte is the data to be written to theinternal data register. The examples shown in Figure 16 toFigure 18 use the ADT7461 SMBus Address 0x4C.\nFigure 16.

If the ADT7461’s address pointer register value is\nunknown or not the desired value, it is necessary\nto set it to the correct value before data can be readfrom the desired data register. This is done bywriting to the ADT7461 as before, but only thedata byte containing the register read address issent, since data is not to be written to the register.This is shown in Figure 17. A read operation is then performed consisting of\nthe serial bus address, R/W\n bit set to 1, followed\nby the data byte read from the data register. This isshown in Figure 18.\n2. If the address pointer register is known to be at the\ndesired address, data can be read from thecorresponding data register without first writing tothe address pointer register and the bus transactionshown in Figure 17 can be omitted.\nAlthough it is possible to read a data byte from a data\nregister without first writing to the address pointer register,\nif the address pointer register is already at the correct value,it is not possible to write data to a register without writing tothe address pointer register because the first data byte of a\nwrite is always written to the address pointer register.\nAlso, some of the registers have different addresses for read\nand write operations. The write address of a register must bewritten to the address pointer if data is to be written to thatregister, but it may not be possible to read data from thataddress. The read address of a register must be written to theaddress pointer before data can be read from that register.\nALERT  Output\nThis is applicable when Pin 6 is configured as an ALERT\noutput. The ALERT  output goes low whenever an\nout-of-limit measurement is detected, or if the remotetemperature sensor is open circuit. It is an open-drain output\nand requires a pullup to V\nDD. Several ALERT  outputs can\nbe wire-ORed together, so the common line goes low if one\nor more of the ALERT  outputs goes low.\nThe ALERT  output can be used as an interrupt signal to a\nprocessor, or it may be used as an SMBALERT . Slave\ndevices on the SMBus cannot normally signal to the busmaster that they want to talk, but the SMBALERT\n function\nallows them to do so.\nOne or more ALERT  outputs can be connected to a\ncommon SMBALERT  line that is connected to the master.\nWhen the SMBALERT  line is pulled low by one of the\ndevices, the procedure shown in Figure 19 occurs.Figure 19. Use of SMBALERTALERT RESPONSE\nADDRESS\nMASTER SENDS\nARA AND READ\nCOMMANDDEVICE SENDS\nITS ADDRESSRD START ACKDEVICE\nADDRESSNO\nACKSTOPMASTER\nRECEIVES\nSMBALERT\n1. SMBALERT  is pulled low.\n2. Master initiates a read operation and sends the\nalert response address (ARA = 0001 100). This isa general call address that must not be used as aspecific device address.\n3. The device whose ALERT\n output is low responds\nto the alert response address and the master readsits device address. As the device address is sevenbits, an LSB of 1 is added. The address of the\ndevice is now known and can be interrogated in\nthe usual way.\n4. If the ALERT\n output is low on more than one\ndevice, the one with the lowest device address haspriority, in accordance with normal SMBusarbitration.\n5. Once the ADT7461 has responded to the alert\nresponse address, it resets its ALERT\n output,\nprovided the error condition that caused the\nALERT  no longer exists. If the SMBALERT  line\nremains low, the master sends the ARA again; thissequence continues until all devices whoseALERT\n out-puts were low have responded.\nLow Power Standby Mode\nThe ADT7461 can be put into low power standby mode\nby set-ting Bit 6 of the configuration register. When Bit 6 islow, the ADT7461 operates normally. When Bit 6 is high,the ADC is inhibited, and any conversion in progress isterminated without writing the result to the correspondingvalue register.\nThe SMBus is still enabled. Power consumption in the\nstandby mode is reduced to less than 10 /C0109A if there is no\nSMBus activity or 100 /C0109A if there are clock and data signals\non the bus.\nWhen the device is in standby mode, it is still possible to\ninitiate a one-shot conversion of both channels by writing to\nthe one-shot register (Address 0x0F), after which the devicereturns to standby. It does not matter what is written to the\none-shot register, as all data written to it is ignored. It is also\npossible to write new values to the limit register while instandby mode. If the values stored in the temperature value\nregisters are now outside the new limits, an ALERT\n is\ngenerated even though the ADT7461 is still in standby.\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n15Sensor Fault Detection\nAt its D+ input, the ADT7461 contains internal sensor\nfault detection circuitry. This circuit can detect situationswhere an external remote diode is either not connected orincorrectly connected to the ADT7461. A simple voltagecomparator trips if the voltage at D+ exceeds V\nDD −1V\n(typical), signifying an open circuit between D+ and D −.\nThe output of this comparator is checked when a conversionis initiated. Bit 2 of the status register (open flag) is set if afault is detected. If the ALERT\n pin is enabled, setting this\nflag causes ALERT  to assert low.\nIf the user does not wish to use an external sensor with the\nADT7461, then to prevent continuous setting of the OPENflag, the user should tie the D+ and D − inputs together.\nThe ADT7461 Interrupt System\nThe ADT7461 has two interrupt outputs, ALERT  and\nTHERM . Both have different functions and behavior.\nALERT  is maskable and responds to violations of\nsoftware-programmed temperature limits or an open-circuit\nfault on the external diode. THERM  is intended as a fail-safe\ninterrupt output that cannot be masked.\nIf the external or local temperature exceeds the\nprogrammed high temperature limits or equals or exceedsthe low temperature limits, the ALERT\n output is asserted\nlow. An open-circuit fault on the external diode also causesALERT\n to assert. ALERT  is reset when serviced by a master\nreading its device address, provided the error condition has\ngone away and the status register has been reset.\nThe THERM  output asserts low if the external or local\ntemperature exceeds the programmed THERM  limits.\nTHERM  temperature limits should normally be equal to or\ngreater than the high temperature limits. THERM  is reset\nautomatically when the temperature falls back within theTHERM\n limit. The external limit is set by default to 85 °C,\nas is the local THERM  limit. A hysteresis value can be\nprogrammed so that THERM  resets when the temperature\nfalls to the limit value minus the hysteresis value. Thisapplies to both local and remote measurement channels. The\npower-on hysteresis default value is 10 °C, but this may be\nreprogrammed to any value after powerup.\nThe hysteresis loop on the THERM\n outputs is useful when\nTHERM  is used for on/off control of a fan. The user’s\nsystem can be set up so that when THERM  asserts, a fan can\nbe switched on to cool the system. When THERM  goes high\nagain, the fan can be switched off. Programming anhysteresis \nvalue protects from fan jitter where the temperature\nhovers around the THERM  limit, and the fan is constantly\nbeing switched.\nTable 14.

A user may choose to use the ALERT  output as an\nSMBALERT  to signal to the host via the SMBus that the\ntemperature has risen. The user could use the THERM\noutput to turn on a fan to cool the system, if the temperature\ncontinues to increase. This method would ensure there is afail-safe mechanism to cool the system without the need for\nhost intervention.\nFigure 20.

If the measured temperature exceeds the high\ntemperature limit, the ALERT  output asserts low.\n2. If the temperature continues to increase and\nexceeds the THERM  limit, the THERM  output\nasserts low. This can be used to throttle the CPUclock or switch on a fan.\n3. The THERM\n output deasserts (goes high) when\nthe temperature falls to THERM  limit minus\nhysteresis. The default hysteresis value of 10 °C is\nshown in Figure 20.\n4. The ALERT  output deasserts only when the\ntemperature falls below the high temperature limit,and the master has read the device address andcleared the status register.Pin 6 on the ADT7461 can be configured as either\nan ALERT\n output or as an additional THERM\noutput. THERM2  asserts low when the\ntemperature exceeds the programmed local and/orremote high temperature limits. It is reset in thesame manner as THERM\n, and it is not maskable.\nThe programmed hysteresis value applies toTHERM2\n also.\nFigure 21 shows how THERM  and THERM2\nmight operate together to implement two methodsof cooling the system. In this example, theTHERM2\n limits are set lower than the THERM\nlimits. The THERM2  output could be used to turn\non a fan. If the temperature continues to rise andexceeds the THERM\n limits, the THERM  output\ncould provide additional cooling by throttling theCPU.\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n16Figure 21.

The THERM  output deasserts (goes high) when the\ntemperature falls to THERM  limit minus hysteresis.\nNo hysteresis value is shown in Figure 21.\n4. As the system continues to cool and the\ntemperature falls below the THERM2  limit, the\nTHERM2  signal resets. Again, no hysteresis value\nis shown for THERM2 .\nBoth the external and internal temperaturemeasurements cause THERM\n and THERM2  to\noperate as described.\nApplication Information\nNoise Filtering\nFor temperature sensors operating in noisy environments,\nthe industry standard practice was to place a capacitor acrossthe D+ and D − pins to help combat the effects of noise.\nHowever, large capacitances affect the accuracy of the\ntemperature measurement, leading to a recommendedmaximum capacitor value of 1,000 pF. While this capacitor\nreduces the noise, it does not eliminate it, making it dif ficult\nto use the sensor in a very noisy environment.\nThe ADT7461 has a major advantage over other devices\nfor eliminating the effects of noise on the external sensor.The series resistance cancellation feature allows a filter to be\nconstructed between the external temperature sensor and the\npart. The effect of any filter resistance seen in series with theremote sensor is automatically cancelled from thetemperature result.\nThe construction of a filter allows the ADT7461 and the\nremote temperature sensor to operate in noisy environments.\nFigure 22 shows a low-pass R-C-R filter with the following\nvalues:\nR = 100 /C0087 and C = 1 nF\nThis filtering reduces both common-mode noise and\ndifferential noise.Figure 22. Filter Between Remote Sensor and\nADT7461 Factors Affecting Diode Accuracy100 /C0087\n100 /C00871 nFD+\nD−REMOTE\nTEMPERATURE\nSENSOR\nRemote Sensing Diode\nThe ADT7461 is designed to work with substrate\ntransistors built into processors or with discrete transistors.Substrate transistors are generally PNP types with the\ncollector connected to the substrate. Discrete types can be\neither PNP or NPN transistor connected as a diode(base-shorted to collector). If an NPN transistor is used, the\ncollector and base are connected to D+ and the emitter to D −.\nIf a PNP transistor is used, the collector and base areconnected to D − and the emitter to D+.\nTo reduce the error due to variations in both substrate and\ndiscrete transistors, several factors should be taken into\nconsideration:\n•The ideality factor, nF, of the transistor is a measure of\nthe deviation of the thermal diode from ideal behavior.\nThe ADT7461 is trimmed for an nF value of 1.008. Thefollowing equation may be used to calculate the errorintroduced at a temperature T ( °C), when using a\ntransistor whose nF does not equal 1.008. Consult theprocessor data sheet for the nF values.\n/C0068T/C0043(nF/C00421.008) /C03241.008 /C0032(273.15 Kelvin /C0041T) (eq. 1)\nTo factor this in, the user can write the /C0068T value to the\noffset register. It is then automatically added to or\nsubtracted from the temperature measurement by the\nADT7461.\n•Some CPU manufacturers specify the high and low\ncurrent levels of the substrate transistors. The high\ncurrent level of the ADT7461, I HIGH , is 96 /C0109A, and the\nlow level current, I LOW, is 6 /C0109A. If the ADT7461\ncurrent levels do not match the current levels specifiedby the CPU manufacturer, it may become necessary toremove an offset. The CPUs data sheet advises whetherthis offset needs to be removed and how to calculate it.This offset may be programmed to the offset register. Itis important to note that if more than one offset must beconsidered, the algebraic sum of these offsets must beprogrammed to the offset register.\nIf a discrete transistor is being used with the ADT7461,\nthe best accuracy is obtained by choosing devices accordingto the following criteria:\n•Base-emitter voltage greater than 0.25 V at 6 /C0109A, at the\nhighest operating temperature.\n•Base-emitter voltage less than 0.95 V at 100 /C0109A, at the\nlowest operating temperature.\n•Base resistance less than 100 /C0087.\n•Small variation in h FE (50 to 150) that indicates tight\ncontrol of V BE characteristics.\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n17Transistors, such as the 2N3904, 2N3906, or equivalents\nin SOT-23 packages are suitable devices to use.\nThermal Inertia and Self-Heating\nAccuracy depends on the temperature of the remote\nsensing diode and/or the internal temperature sensor beingat the same temperature as the environment being measured;\nmany factors can affect this. Ideally , the sensor should be in\ngood thermal contact with the part of the system being\nmeasured. If it is not, the thermal inertia caused by the\nsensor’s mass causes a lag in the response of the sensor to a\ntemperature change. With a remote sensor, this should not be\na problem since it will be either a substrate transistor in theprocessor or a small package device, such as the SOT-23,placed in close proximity to it.\nThe on-chip sensor, however, is often remote from the\nprocessor and only monitors the general ambient\ntemperature around the package. The thermal time constant\nof the SOIC-8 package in still air is about 140 seconds, and\nif the ambient air temperature quickly changed by100 degrees, it would take about 12 minutes (5 timeconstants) for the junction temperature of the ADT7461 tosettle within 1 degree of this. In practice, the ADT7461package is in electrical, and hence thermal, contact with aPCB and may also be in a forced airflow. How accurately the\ntemperature of the board and/or the forced airflow reflects\nthe temperature to be measured also affects the accuracy.Self-heating due to the power dissipated in the ADT7461 or\nthe remote sensor causes the chip temperature of the deviceor remote sensor to rise above ambient. However, the currentforced through the remote sensor is so small that self-heatingis negligible. With the ADT7461, the worst-case conditionoccurs when the device is converting at 64 conversions per\nsecond while sinking the maximum current of 1 mA at the\nALERT\n and THERM  output. In this case, the total power\ndissipation in the device is about 4.5 mW. The thermal\nresistance, /C0113JA, of the SOIC-8 package is about 121 °C/W.\nLayout Considerations\nDigital boards can be electrically noisy environments, and\nthe ADT7461 is measuring very small voltages from theremote sensor, so care must be taken to minimize noiseinduced at the sensor inputs. The following precautionsshould be taken:\n1. Place the ADT7461 as close as possible to the\nremote sensing diode. Provided the worst noisesources, such as clock generators, data/addressbuses, and CRTs, are avoided, this distance can be4 inches to 8 inches.\n2. Route the D+ and D– tracks close together, in\nparallel, with grounded guard tracks on each side.To minimize inductance and reduce noise pick-up, a5 mil track width and spacing is recommended.\nProvide a ground plane under the tracks if possible.Figure 23. Typical Arrangement of Signal Tracks5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL5 MIL\nGNDD−D+GND\n3. Try to minimize the number of copper/solder\njoints that can cause thermocouple effects. Wherecopper/solder joints are used, make sure that theyare in both the D+ and D − path and at the same\ntemperature. Thermocouple effects should not be a major\nproblem as 1 °C corresponds to about 200 mV , and\nthermocouple voltages are about 3 mV/ °C of\ntemperature difference. Unless there are twothermocouples with a big temperature differentialbetween them, thermocouple voltages should bemuch less than 200 mV .\n4. Place a 0.1 /C0109F bypass capacitor close to the V\nDD\npin. In extremely noisy environments, an input filter\ncapacitor may be placed across D+ and D − close to\nthe ADT7461. This capacitance can effect thetemperature measurement, so care must be taken toensure any capacitance seen at D+ and D − is a\nmaximum of 1,000 pF. This maximum value\nincludes the filter capacitance plus any cable or straycapacitance between the pins and the sensor diode.\n5. If the distance to the remote sensor is more than\n8 inches, the use of twisted pair cable isrecommended. This works up to about 6 to 12 feet.For extremely long distances (up to 100 feet), usea shielded twisted pair, such as the Belden No.8451 microphone cable. Connect the twisted pairto D+ and D − and the shield to GND close to the\nADT7461. Leave the remote end of the shield\nunconnected to avoid ground loops.\nBecause the measurement technique uses switched\ncurrent sources, excessive cable or filter capacitance canaffect the measurement. When using long cables, the filtercapacitance may be reduced or removed.\nApplication Circuit\nFigure 24 shows a typical application circuit for the\nADT7461 using a discrete sensor transistor connected via ashielded, twisted pair cable. The pull-ups on SCLK, SDATA,and ALERT\n are required only if they are not already provided\nelsewhere in the system.\nThe SCLK and SDATA pins of the ADT7461 can be\ninterfaced directly to the SMBus of an I/O controller, such\nas the Intel®820 chipset.\nADT7461\nwww. onsemi.com\n18Figure 24.
