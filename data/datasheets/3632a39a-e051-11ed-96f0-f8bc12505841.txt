V 06/18 EN 6Micron Technology, Inc. reserves the right to change products or specifications without notice.\n© 2011 Micron Technology, Inc. All rights reserved.\nDevice Description\nThe N25Q is a high-performance multiple input/output serial Flash memory device\nmanufactured on 65nm NOR technology. It features execute-in-place (XIP) functionali-\nty, advanced write protection mechanisms, and a high-speed SPI-compatible bus inter-\nface. Innovative, high-performance, dual and quad input/output instructions enable\ndouble or quadruple the transfer bandwidth for READ and PROGRAM operations.\nFeatures\nThe 512Mb N25Q stacked device contains two 256Mb die. From a user standpoint this\nstacked device behaves as a monolithic device, except with regard to READ MEMORY\nand ERASE operations and status polling. The device contains a single chip select (S#); a\ndual-chip version is also available. Contact the factory for more information.\nThe memory is organized as 1024 (64KB) main sectors that are further divided into 16\nsubsectors each (16,384 subsectors in total). The memory can be erased one 4KB sub-\nsector at a time, 64KB sectors at a time, or single die (256Mb) at a time.\nThe memory can be write protected by software through volatile and nonvolatile pro-\ntection features, depending on the application needs. The protection granularity is of\n64KB (sector granularity) for volatile protections\nThe device has 64 one-time programmable (OTP) bytes that can be read and program-\nmed with the READ OTP and PROGRAM OTP commands. These 64 bytes can also be\npermanently locked with a PROGRAM OTP command.\nThe device can also pause and resume PROGRAM and ERASE cycles by using dedicated\nPROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND and RESUME instructions.\n3-Byte Address and 4-Byte Address Modes\nThe device features 3-byte or 4-byte address modes to access memory beyond 128Mb.\nWhen 4-byte address mode is enabled, all commands requiring an address must be en-\ntered and exited with a 4-byte address mode command: ENTER 4-BYTE ADDRESS\nMODE command and EXIT 4-BYTE ADDRESS MODE command. The 4-byte address\nmode can also be enabled through the nonvolatile configuration register. See Registers\nfor more information.\nOperating Protocols\nThe memory can be operated with three different protocols:\n• Extended SPI (standard SPI protocol upgraded with dual and quad operations)\n• Dual I/O SPI\n• Quad I/O SPI\nThe standard SPI protocol is extended and enhanced by dual and quad operations. In\naddition, the dual SPI and quad SPI protocols improve the data access time and\nthroughput of a single I/O device by transmitting commands, addresses, and data\nacross two or four data lines.\nEach protocol contains unique commands to perform READ operations in DTR mode.\nThis enables high data throughput while running at lower clock frequencies.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nDevice Description\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nXIP Mode\nXIP mode requires only an address (no instruction) to output data, improving random\naccess time and eliminating the need to shadow code onto RAM for fast execution.\nNonvolatile configuration register bits can set XIP mode as the default mode for appli-\ncations that must enter XIP mode immediately after powering up.\nAll protocols support XIP operation. For flexibility, multiple XIP entry and exit methods\nare available. For applications that must enter XIP mode immediately after power-up,\nnonvolatile configuration register bit settings can enable XIP as the default mode.\nDevice Configurability\nThe N25Q family offers additional features that are configured through the nonvolatile\nconfiguration register for default and/or nonvolatile settings. Volatile settings can be\nconfigured through the volatile and volatile-enhanced configuration registers. These\nconfigurable features include the following:\n• Number of dummy cycles for the fast READ commands\n• Output buffer impedance\n• SPI protocol types (extended SPI, dual SPI, or quad SPI)\n• Required XIP mode\n• Enabling/disabling HOLD (RESET function)\n• Enabling/disabling wrap mode\nFigure 1: Logic Diagram\nNOR die 1NOR die 2VCC\nCDQ1\nRESETDQ0\nVSSS#\nVPP/W#/DQ2\nHOLD#/DQ3\nNote: 1.

See Signal Assignments\nfor information specific to this device.\nTable 1: Signal Descriptions\nSymbol Type Description\nC Input Clock:  Provides the timing of the serial interface. Commands, addresses, or data present at se-\nrial data inputs are latched on the rising edge of the clock. Data is shifted out on the falling\nedge of the clock.\nS# Input Chip select:  When S# is HIGH, the device is deselected and DQ1 is at High-Z. When in exten-\nded SPI mode, with the device deselected, DQ1 is tri-stated. Unless an internal PROGRAM,\nERASE, or WRITE STATUS REGISTER cycle is in progress, the device enters standby power mode\n(not deep power-down mode). Driving S# LOW enables the device, placing it in the active pow-\ner mode. After power-up, a falling edge on S# is required prior to the start of any command.\nDQ0 Input\nand I/OSerial data:  Transfers data serially into the device. It receives command codes, addresses, and\nthe data to be programmed. Values are latched on the rising edge of the clock. DQ0 is used for\ninput/output during the following operations: DUAL OUTPUT FAST READ, QUAD OUTPUT FAST\nREAD, DUAL INPUT/OUTPUT FAST READ, and QUAD INPUT/OUTPUT FAST READ. When used for\noutput, data is shifted out on the falling edge of the clock.\nIn DIO-SPI, DQ0 always acts as an input/output.\nIn QIO-SPI, DQ0 always acts as an input/output, with the exception of the PROGRAM or ERASE\ncycle performed with V PP. The device temporarily enters the extended SPI protocol and then re-\nturns to QIO-SPI as soon as V PP goes LOW.\nDQ1 Output\nand I/OSerial data: Transfers data serially out of the device. Data is shifted out on the falling edge of\nthe clock. DQ1 is used for input/output during the following operations: DUAL INPUT FAST\nPROGRAM, QUAD INPUT FAST PROGRAM, DUAL INPUT EXTENDED FAST PROGRAM, and QUAD\nINPUT EXTENDED FAST PROGRAM. When used for input, data is latched on the rising edge of\nthe clock.\nIn DIO-SPI, DQ1 always acts as an input/output.\nIn QIO-SPI, DQ1 always acts as an input/output, with the exception of the PROGRAM or ERASE\ncycle performed with the enhanced program supply voltage (V PP). In this case the device tem-\nporarily enters the extended SPI protocol and then returns to QIO-SPI as soon as V PP goes LOW.\nDQ2 Input\nand I/ODQ2:  When in QIO-SPI mode or in extended SPI mode using QUAD FAST READ commands, the\nsignal functions as DQ2, providing input/output.\nAll data input drivers are always enabled except when used as an output. Micron recommends\ncustomers drive the data signals normally (to avoid unnecessary switching current) and float\nthe signals before the memory device drives data on them.\nDQ3 Input\nand I/ODQ3:  When in quad SPI mode or in extended SPI mode using quad FAST READ commands, the\nsignal functions as DQ3, providing input/output. HOLD# is disabled and RESET# is disabled if\nthe device is selected.\nRESET# Control\nInputRESET:  This is a hardware RESET# signal. When RESET# is driven HIGH, the memory is in the\nnormal operating mode. When RESET# is driven LOW, the memory enters reset mode and out-\nput is High-Z. If RESET# is driven LOW while an internal WRITE, PROGRAM, or ERASE operation\nis in progress, data may be lost.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nSignal Descriptions\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nTable 1: Signal Descriptions (Continued)\nSymbol Type Description\nHOLD# Control\nInputHOLD:  Pauses any serial communications with the device without deselecting the device. DQ1\n(output) is High-Z. DQ0 (input) and the clock are "Don\'t Care." To enable HOLD, the device\nmust be selected with S# driven LOW.\nHOLD# is used for input/output during the following operations: QUAD OUTPUT FAST READ,\nQUAD INPUT/OUTPUT FAST READ, QUAD INPUT FAST PROGRAM, and QUAD INPUT EXTENDED\nFAST PROGRAM.\nIn QIO-SPI, HOLD# acts as an I/O (DQ3 functionality), and the HOLD# functionality is disabled\nwhen the device is selected. When the device is deselected (S# is HIGH) in parts with RESET#\nfunctionality, it is possible to reset the device unless this functionality is not disabled by means\nof dedicated registers bits.\nThe HOLD# functionality can be disabled using bit 4 of the NVCR or bit 4 of the VECR.\nOn devices that include DTR mode capability, the HOLD# functionality is disabled as soon as a\nDTR operation is recognized.\nW# Control\nInputWrite protect:  W# can be used as a protection control input or in QIO-SPI operations. When in\nextended SPI with single or dual commands, the WRITE PROTECT function is selectable by the\nvoltage range applied to the signal. If voltage range is low (0V to V CC), the signal acts as a\nwrite protection control input. The memory size protected against PROGRAM or ERASE opera-\ntions is locked as specified in the status register block protect bits 3:0.\nW# is used as an input/output (DQ2 functionality) during QUAD INPUT FAST READ and QUAD\nINPUT/OUTPUT FAST READ operations and in QIO-SPI.\nVPP Power Supply voltage:  If V PP is in the voltage range of V PPH, the signal acts as an additional power\nsupply, as defined in the AC Measurement Conditions table.\nDuring QIFP, QIEFP, and QIO-SPI PROGRAM/ERASE operations, it is possible to use the addition-\nal V PP power supply to speed up internal operations. However, to enable this functionality, it is\nnecessary to set bit 3 of the VECR to 0.\nIn this case, V PP is used as an I/O until the end of the operation. After the last input data is shif-\nted in, the application should apply V PP voltage to V PP within 200ms to speed up the internal\noperations. If the V PP voltage is not applied within 200ms, the PROGRAM/ERASE operations\nstart at standard speed.\nThe default value of VECR bit 3 is 1, and the V PP functionality for quad I/O modify operations is\ndisabled.\nVCC Power Device core power supply:  Source voltage.\nVSS Ground Ground:  Reference for the V CC supply voltage.\nDNU – Do not use.\nNC – No connect.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nSignal Descriptions\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

The difference between the two modes is the clock\npolarity when the bus master is in standby mode and not transferring data. Input data is\nlatched in on the rising edge of the clock, and output data is available from the falling\nedge of the clock.\nTable 7: SPI Modes\nNote 1 applies to the entire table\nSPI Modes Clock Polarity\nCPOL = 0, CPHA = 0 C remains at 0 for (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)\nCPOL = 1, CPHA = 1 C remains at 1 for (CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1)\nNote: 1. The listed SPI modes are supported in extended, dual, and quad SPI protocols.\nShown below is an example of three memory devices in extended SPI protocol in a sim-\nple connection to an MCU on an SPI bus. Because only one device is selected at a time,\nthat one device drives DQ1, while the other devices are High-Z.\nResistors ensure the device is not selected if the bus master leaves S# High-Z. The bus\nmaster might enter a state in which all input/output is High-Z simultaneously, such as\nwhen the bus master is reset. Therefore, the serial clock must be connected to an exter-\nnal pull-down resistor so that S# is pulled HIGH while the serial clock is pulled LOW.\nThis ensures that S# and the serial clock are not HIGH simultaneously and that tSHCH\nis met. The typical resistor value of 100k Ω, assuming that the time constant R × Cp (Cp =\nparasitic capacitance of the bus line), is shorter than the time the bus master leaves the\nSPI bus in High-Z.\nExample:  Cp = 50pF , that is R × Cp = 5μs. The application must ensure that the bus mas-\nter never leaves the SPI bus High-Z for a time period shorter than 5μs. W# and HOLD#\nshould be driven either HIGH or LOW, as appropriate.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nSerial Peripheral Interface Modes\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

Additional com-\nmands extend the standard SPI protocol and enable address\nor data transmission on multiple DQ n lines.\nDual DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] Volatile selectable:  When the enhanced volatile configu-\nration register bit 6 is set to 0 and bit 7 is set to 1, the de-\nvice enters the dual SPI protocol immediately after the\nWRITE ENHANCED VOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER\ncommand. The device returns to the default protocol after\nthe next power-on. In addition, the device can return to de-\nfault protocol using the rescue sequence or through new\nWRITE ENHANCED VOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER\ncommand, without power-off or power-on.\nNonvolatile selectable:  When nonvolatile configuration\nregister bit 2 is set, the device enters the dual SPI protocol\nafter the next power-on. Once this register bit is set, the de-\nvice defaults to the dual SPI protocol after all subsequent\npower-on sequences until the nonvolatile configuration\nregister bit is reset to 1.\nQuad1DQ[3:0] DQ[3:0] DQ[3:0] Volatile selectable:  When the enhanced volatile configu-\nration register bit 7 is set to 0, the device enters the quad\nSPI protocol immediately after the WRITE ENHANCED VOL-\nATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command. The device re-\nturns to the default protocol after the next power-on. In ad-\ndition, the device can return to default protocol using the\nrescue sequence or through new WRITE ENHANCED VOLA-\nTILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command, without power-\noff or power-on.\nNonvolatile selectable: When nonvolatile configuration\nregister bit 3 is set to 0, the device enters the quad SPI pro-\ntocol after the next power-on. Once this register bit is set,\nthe device defaults to the quad SPI protocol after all subse-\nquent power-on sequences until the nonvolatile configura-\ntion register bit is reset to 1.\nNote: 1. In quad SPI protocol, all command/address input and data I/O are transmitted on four\nlines except during a PROGRAM and ERASE cycle performed with V PP. In this case, the\ndevice enters the extended SPI protocol to temporarily allow the application to perform\na PROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND operation or to check the write-in-progress bit in the sta-\ntus register or the program/erase controller bit in the flag status register. Then, when\nVPP goes LOW, the device returns to the quad SPI protocol.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nSPI Protocols\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

As shown below, parameters in the internal configuration\nregister are loaded from the nonvolatile configuration register during each device boot\nphase or power-on reset. In this sense, then, the nonvolatile configuration register con-\ntains the default settings of memory.\nAlso, during the life of an application, each time a WRITE VOLATILE or ENHANCED\nVOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command executes to set configuration pa-\nrameters in these respective registers, these new settings are copied to the internal con-\nfiguration register. Therefore, memory settings can be changed in real time. However, at\nthe next power-on reset, the memory boots according to the memory settings defined\nin the nonvolatile configuration register parameters.\nFigure 8: Internal Configuration Register\nRegister download is executed only during\nthe power-on phase or after a reset,\noverwriting configuration register settings\non the internal configuration register.Register download is executed after a\nWRITE VOLATILE OR ENHANCED VOLATILE\nCONFIGURATION REGISTER command,\noverwriting configuration register\nsettings on the internal configuration register.Nonvolatile configuration register\nInternal configuration\nregister\nDevice behaviorVolatile configuration register and\nenhanced volatile configuration register512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nNonvolatile and Volatile Registers\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

The status register write enable/disable bit, combined with the W#/V PP signal as descri-\nbed in the Signal Descriptions, provides hardware data protection for the device as fol-\nlows: When the enable/disable bit is set to 1, and the W#/V PP signal is driven LOW, the\nstatus register nonvolatile bits become read-only and the WRITE STATUS REGISTER oper-\nation will not execute. The only way to exit this hardware-protected mode is to drive\nW#/V PP HIGH.\n4. See Protected Area Sizes tables. The DIE ERASE command is executed only if all bits are\n0.\n5. In case of protection error this volatile bit is set and can be reset only by means of a\nCLEAR FLAG STATUS REGISTER command.\n6.

The extended address register bits [1:0] are used to select one of the four 128Mb\nsegments of the memory array.\nFigure 9: Upper and Lower Memory Array Segments\nA[25:24] = 00A[25:24] = 01A[25:24] = 10A[25:24] = 11\n00FFFFFFh\n00000000h01FFFFFFh\n01000000h02FFFFFFh\n02000000h03FFFFFFh\n03000000h\nThe PROGRAM and ERASE operations act upon the 128Mb segment selected in the ex-\ntended address register.\nThe READ operation begins reading in the selected 128Mb segment. It is bound by the\n256Mb (die segment) to which the 128Mb segment belongs. In a continuos read, when\nthe last byte of the die segment selected is read, the next byte output is the first byte of\nthe same die segment; therefore, a download of the whole array is not possible with one\nREAD operation. The value of the extended address register does not change when a\nREAD operation crosses the selected 128Mb boundary.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nNonvolatile and Volatile Registers\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

For extended SPI\nprotocol, the command code is input on DQ0, and output on DQ1. For dual SPI proto-\ncol, the command code is input on DQ[1:0], and output on DQ[1:0]. For quad SPI proto-\ncol, the command code is input on DQ[3:0], and is output on DQ[3:0]. The operation is\nterminated by driving S# HIGH at any time during data output.\nThe status register can be read continuously and at any time, including during a PRO-\nGRAM, ERASE, or WRITE operation.\nThe flag status register can be read continuously and at any time, including during an\nERASE or WRITE operation.\nIf one of these operations is in progress, checking the write in progress bit or program or\nerase controller bit is recommended before executing the command.\nThe flag status register must be read any time a PROGRAM, ERASE, or SUSPEND/\nRESUME command is issued, or after a RESET command while device is busy. The cycle\nis not complete until bit 7 of the flag status register outputs 1. Refer to Command Defi-\nnitions for more information.\nNote:  The end of an operation (such as a power-up, WRITE STATUS REGISTER, or\nWRITE NONVOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER) is determined by issuing the\nREAD FLAG STATUS REGISTER command once for each die in the device, with S# tog-\ngled between commands until each die is ready.

Se-\nlection of the 3-byte or 4-byte address range can be enabled in two ways: through the\nnonvolatile configuration register or through the ENABLE 4-BYTE ADDRESS MODE/\nEXIT 4-BYTE ADDRESS MODE commands. Further details for these settings and com-\nmands are in the respective register and command sections of the data sheet.\nAfter any READ command is executed, the device will output data from the selected ad-\ndress in the die. After a die boundary is reached, the device will start reading again from\nthe beginning of the same 256Mb die.\nA complete device reading is completed by executing read twice.\n3-Byte Address\nTo execute READ MEMORY commands, S# is driven LOW. The command code is input\non DQ n, followed by input on DQ n of three address bytes. Each address bit is latched in\nduring the rising edge of the clock. The addressed byte can be at any location, and the\naddress automatically increments to the next address after each byte of data is shifted\nout; therefore, a die can be read with a single command. The operation is terminated by\ndriving S# HIGH at any time during data output.\nTable 26: Command/Address/Data Lines for READ MEMORY Commands\nNote 1 applies to entire table\nCommand Name\nREADFAST\nREADDUAL OUTPUT\nFAST READDUAL\nINPUT/OUTPUT\nFAST READQUAD OUTPUT\nFAST READQUAD\nINPUT/OUTPUT\nFAST READ\nSTR Mode 03 0B 3B BB 6B EB\nDTR Mode – 0D 3D BD 6D ED\nExtended SPI Protocol\nSupported Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nCommand Input DQ0 DQ0 DQ0 DQ0 DQ0 DQ0\nAddress Input DQ0 DQ0 DQ0 DQ[1:0] DQ0 DQ[3:0]\nData Output DQ1 DQ1 DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] DQ[3:0] DQ[3:0]\nDual SPI Protocol\nSupported No Yes Yes Yes No No\nCommand Input – DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] – –\nAddress Input – DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] – –\nData Output – DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] – –\nQuad SPI Protocol\nSupported No Yes No No Yes Yes\nCommand Input – DQ[3:0] – – DQ[3:0] DQ[3:0]\nAddress Input – DQ[3:0] – – DQ[3:0] DQ[3:0]512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nREAD MEMORY Operations\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

S# is then driven LOW and held LOW until the eighth\nbit of the last data byte has been latched in, after which it must be driven HIGH. The\ncommand code is input on DQ0, followed by input on DQ[n] of address bytes and at\nleast one data byte. Each address bit is latched in during the rising edge of the clock.\nWhen S# is driven HIGH, the operation, which is self-timed, is initiated; its duration is\ntPP .\nIf the bits of the least significant address, which is the starting address, are not all zero,\nall data transmitted beyond the end of the current page is programmed from the start-\ning address of the same page. If the number of bytes sent to the device exceed the maxi-\nmum page size, previously latched data is discarded and only the last maximum page-\nsize number of data bytes are guaranteed to be programmed correctly within the same\npage. If the number of bytes sent to the device is less than the maximum page size, they\nare correctly programmed at the specified addresses without any effect on the other\nbytes of the same page.\nWhen the operation is in progress, the program or erase controller bit of the flag status\nregister is set to 0. The write enable latch bit is cleared to 0, whether the operation is\nsuccessful or not. The status register and flag status register can be polled for the opera-\ntion status. The operation is considered complete after bit 7 of the flag status register\noutputs 1 with at least one byte output. When the operation completes, the program or\nerase controller bit is cleared to 1.\nIf the operation times out, the write enable latch bit is reset and the program fail bit is\nset to 1. If S# is not driven HIGH, the command is not executed, flag status register error\nbits are not set, and the write enable latch remains set to 1. When a command is applied\nto a protected sector, the command is not executed, the write enable latch bit remains\nset to 1, and flag status register bits 1 and 4 are set.\nNote that the flag status register must be polled even if operation times out.\nTable 28: Data/Address Lines for PROGRAM Commands\nNote 1 applies to entire table\nCommand Name Data In Address In Extended Dual Quad\nPAGE PROGRAM DQ0 DQ0 Yes Yes Yes\nDUAL INPUT FAST PROGRAM DQ[1:0] DQ0 Yes Yes No\nEXTENDED DUAL INPUT\nFAST PROGRAMDQ[1:0] DQ[1:0] Yes Yes No\nQUAD INPUT FAST PROGRAM DQ[3:0] DQ0 Yes No Yes\nEXTENDED QUAD INPUT\nFAST PROGRAMDQ[3:0] DQ[3:0] Yes No Yes\nNote: 1.Yes in the protocol columns indicates that the command is supported and has the same\nfunctionality and command sequence as other commands marked Yes.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nPROGRAM Operations\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

To execute a WRITE ENA-\nBLE command, S# is driven LOW and held LOW until the eighth bit of the command\ncode has been latched in, after which it must be driven HIGH. The command code is\ninput on DQ0 for extended SPI protocol, on DQ[1:0] for dual SPI protocol, and on\nDQ[3:0] for quad SPI protocol.\nThe write enable latch bit must be set before every PROGRAM, ERASE, WRITE, ENTER\n4-BYTE ADDRESS MODE, and EXIT 4-BYTE ADDRESS MODE command. If S# is not\ndriven HIGH after the command code has been latched in, the command is not execu-\nted, flag status register error bits are not set, and the write enable latch remains cleared\nto its default setting of 0.\nWRITE DISABLE Command\nThe WRITE DISABLE operation clears the write enable latch bit. To execute a WRITE\nDISABLE command, S# is driven LOW and held LOW until the eighth bit of the com-\nmand code has been latched in, after which it must be driven HIGH. The command\ncode is input on DQ0 for extended SPI protocol, on DQ[1:0] for dual SPI protocol, and\non DQ[3:0] for quad SPI protocol.\nIf S# is not driven HIGH after the command code has been latched in, the command is\nnot executed, flag status register error bits are not set, and the write enable latch re-\nmains set to 1.\nNote: In case of a protection error, write disable will not clear the write enable latch. In\nthis situation, a CLEAR FLAG STATUS REGISTER command must be issued to clear\nboth flags.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nWRITE Operations\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

The flag status register must be polled for the operation status. When\nthe operation completes, that bit is cleared to 1.\nNote that the flag status register must be polled even if operation times out.\nSUBSECTOR ERASE Command\nTo execute the SUBSECTOR ERASE command (and set the selected subsector bits to\nFFh), the WRITE ENABLE command must be issued to set the write enable latch bit to\n1. S# is driven LOW and held LOW until the eighth bit of the last data byte has been\nlatched in, after which it must be driven HIGH. The command code is input on DQ0,\nfollowed by address bytes; any address within the subsector is valid. Each address bit is\nlatched in during the rising edge of the clock. When S# is driven HIGH, the operation,\nwhich is self-timed, is initiated; its duration is tSSE. The operation can be suspended\nand resumed by the PROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND and PROGRAM/ERASE RESUME\ncommands, respectively.\nIf the write enable latch bit is not set, the device ignores the SUBSECTOR ERASE com-\nmand and no error bits are set to indicate operation failure.\nWhen the operation is in progress, the program or erase controller bit is set to 0. The\nwrite enable latch bit is cleared to 0, whether the operation is successful or not. The sta-\ntus register and flag status register can be polled for the operation status. The operation\nis considered complete once bit 7 of the flag status register outputs 1 with at least one\nbyte output. When the operation completes, the program or erase controller bit is\ncleared to 1.\nIf the operation times out, the write enable latch bit is reset and the erase error bit is set\nto 1. If S# is not driven HIGH, the command is not executed, flag status register error\nbits are not set, and the write enable latch remains set to 1. When a command is applied\nto a protected subsector, the command is not executed. Instead, the write enable latch\nbit remains set to 1, and flag status register bits 1 and 5 are set.\nSECTOR ERASE Command\nTo execute the SECTOR ERASE command (and set selected sector bits to FFh), the\nWRITE ENABLE command must be issued to set the write enable latch bit to 1. S# is\ndriven LOW and held LOW until the eighth bit of the last data byte has been latched in,\nafter which it must be driven HIGH. The command code is input on DQ0, followed by\naddress bytes; any address within the sector is valid. Each address bit is latched in dur-\ning the rising edge of the clock. When S# is driven HIGH, the operation, which is self-\ntimed, is initiated; its duration is tSE. The operation can be suspended and resumed by\nthe PROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND and PROGRAM/ERASE RESUME commands, respec-\ntively.\nIf the write enable latch bit is not set, the device ignores the SECTOR ERASE command\nand no error bits are set to indicate operation failure.\nWhen the operation is in progress, the program or erase controller bit is set to 0.

The com-\nmand code is input on DQ0. The operation is terminated by the PROGRAM/ERASE RE-\nSUME command.\nPROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND command enables the memory controller to interrupt\nand suspend an array PROGRAM or ERASE operation within the program/erase latency.\nIf a SUSPEND command is issued during a PROGRAM operation, then the flag status\nregister bit 2 is set to 1. After erase/program latency time, the flag status register bit 7 is\nalso set to 1, but the device is considered in suspended state once bit 7 of the flag status\nregister outputs 1 with at least one byte output. In the suspended state, the device is\nwaiting for any operation. (See the Operations Allowed/Disallowed During Device\nStates table.)\nIf a SUSPEND command is issued during an ERASE operation, then the flag status regis-\nter bit 6 is set to 1. After erase/program latency time, the flag status register bit 7 is also\nset to 1, but the device is considered in suspended state once bit 7 of the flag status reg-\nister outputs 1 with at least one byte output. In the suspended state, the device is wait-\ning for any operation. (See the Operations Allowed/Disallowed During Device States ta-\nble.)\nIf the time remaining to complete the operation is less than the suspend latency, the de-\nvice completes the operation and clears the flag status register bits 2 or 6, as applicable.\nBecause the suspend state is volatile, if there is a power cycle, the suspend state infor-\nmation is lost and the flag status register powers up as 80h.\nDuring an ERASE SUSPEND operation, a PROGRAM or READ operation is possible in\nany sector except the one in a suspended state. Reading from a sector that is in a sus-\npended state will output indeterminate data.

Reading from a page that is in a suspended state will\noutput indeterminate data. The commands allowed during a program suspend state in-\nclude the WRITE VOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command and the WRITE\nENHANCED VOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command.\nIt is possible to nest a PROGRAM/ERASE SUSPEND operation inside a PROGRAM/\nERASE SUSPEND operation just once. Issue an ERASE command and suspend it. Then\nissue a PROGRAM command and suspend it also.

A minimum de-selection time of tSHSL2 must come between the RE-\nSET ENABLE and RESET MEMORY commands or a reset is not guaranteed. When these\ntwo commands are executed and S# is driven HIGH, the device enters a power-on reset\ncondition. A time of tSHSL3 is required before the device can be re-selected by driving\nS# LOW. It is recommended that the device exit XIP mode before executing these two\ncommands to initiate a reset.\nIf a reset is initiated while a WRITE, PROGRAM, or ERASE operation is in progress or\nsuspended, the operation is aborted and data may be corrupted.\nFigure 35: RESET ENABLE and RESET MEMORY Command\nC\nS#\nDQ00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nReset enable Reset memory\nNote: 1.

The command code is in-\nput on DQ0/DQ4, followed by address bytes and dummy clock cycles. Each address bit\nis latched in during the rising edge of C. Data is shifted out on DQ1/DQ5, beginning\nfrom the specified address and at a maximum frequency of fC (MAX) on the falling edge\nof the clock. The address increments automatically to the next address after each byte of\ndata is shifted out. There is no rollover mechanism; therefore, if read continuously, after\nlocation 0x40, the device continues to output data at location 0x40.

XIP mode offers maximum flexibility to the application,\nsaves instruction overhead, and reduces random access time.\nActivate or Terminate XIP Using Volatile Configuration Register\nApplications that boot in SPI and must switch to XIP use the volatile configuration reg-\nister. XIP provides faster memory READ operations by requiring only an address to exe-\ncute, rather than a command code and an address.\nTo activate XIP requires two steps. First, enable XIP by setting volatile configuration reg-\nister bit 3 to 0. Next, drive the XIP confirmation bit to 0 during the next FAST READ op-\neration. XIP is then active. Once in XIP , any command that occurs after S# is toggled re-\nquires only address bits to execute; a command code is not necessary, and device oper-\nations use the SPI protocol that is enabled. XIP is terminated by driving the XIP confir-\nmation bit to 1. The device automatically resets volatile configuration register bit 3 to 1.\nNote:  For devices with basic XIP , indicated by a part number feature set digit of 2 or 4, it\nis not necessary to set the volatile configuration register bit 3 to 0 to enable XIP . Instead,\nit is enabled by setting the XIP confirmation bit to 0 during the first dummy clock cycle\nafter any FAST READ command.\nActivate or Terminate XIP Using Nonvolatile Configuration Register\nApplications that must boot directly in XIP use the nonvolatile configuration register. To\nenable a device to power-up in XIP using the nonvolatile configuration register, set non-\nvolatile configuration register bits [11:9]. Settings vary according to protocol, as ex-\nplained in the Nonvolatile Configuration Register section. Because the device boots di-\nrectly in XIP , after the power cycle, no command code is necessary. XIP is terminated by\ndriving the XIP confirmation bit to 1.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nXIP Mode\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

This bit is the value on DQ0 during the first dummy clock cycle in the FAST\nREAD operation. In dual I/O XIP mode, the value of DQ1 during the first dummy clock\ncycle after the addresses is always "Don\'t Care."

In a device with a dedicated\npart number, it is only possible to reset memory when the device is deselected.\nNote: 1.

All rights reserved.\nTerminating XIP After a Controller and Memory Reset\nThe system controller and the device can become out of synchronization if, during the\nlife of the application, the system controller is reset without the device being reset. In\nsuch a case, the controller can reset the memory to power-on reset if the memory has\nreset functionality. (Reset is available in devices with a dedicated part number.)\n• 7 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 8th clock cycle)\n• + 9 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 10th clock cycle)\n• + 13 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 14th clock cycle)\n• + 17 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 18th clock cycle)\n• + 25 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 26th clock cycle)\n• + 33 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 34th clock cycle)\nThese sequences cause the controller to set the XIP confirmation bit to 1, thereby termi-\nnating XIP . However, it does not reset the device or interrupt PROGRAM/ERASE opera-\ntions that may be in progress. After terminating XIP , the controller must execute RESET\nENABLE and RESET MEMORY to implement a software reset and reset the device.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nXIP Mode\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nPower-Up and Power-Down\nPower-Up and Power-Down Requirements\nAt power-up and power-down, the device must not be selected; that is, S# must follow\nthe voltage applied on V CC until V CC reaches the correct values: V CC,min  at power-up and\nVSS at power-down.\nTo avoid data corruption and inadvertent WRITE operations during power-up, a power-\non reset circuit is included. The logic inside the device is held to RESET while V CC is less\nthan the power-on reset threshold voltage shown here; all operations are disabled, and\nthe device does not respond to any instruction. During a standard power-up phase, the\ndevice ignores all commands except READ STATUS REGISTER and READ FLAG STATUS\nREGISTER. These operations can be used to check the memory internal state. After\npower-up, the device is in standby power mode; the write enable latch bit is reset; the\nwrite in progress bit is reset; and the lock registers are configured as: (write lock bit, lock\ndown bit) = (0,0).\nNormal precautions must be taken for supply line decoupling to stabilize the V CC sup-\nply. Each device in a system should have the V CC line decoupled by a suitable capacitor\n(typically 100nF) close to the package pins. At power-down, when V CC drops from the\noperating voltage to below the power-on-reset threshold voltage shown here, all opera-\ntions are disabled and the device does not respond to any command.\nWhen the operation is in progress, the program or erase controller bit of the status reg-\nister is set to 0. To obtain the operation status, the flag status register must be polled\nonce for each die in the device, with S# toggled twice between commands, until each\ndie is ready. When the operation completes, the program or erase controller bit is\ncleared to 1. The cycle is complete after the flag status register outputs the program or\nerase controller bit to 1 for each polling operation.\nNote: If power-down occurs while a WRITE, PROGRAM, or ERASE cycle is in progress,\ndata corruption may result.\nVPPH must be applied only when V CC is stable and in the V CC,min  to V CC,max  voltage\nrange.\nFigure 39: Power-Up Timing\nVCC\nVCC,min\nVWIChip resetS# not allowed\nPolling allowedtVTPtVTW = tVTR \nTimeVCC,max\nDevice fully accessible\nSPI protocol Starting protocol defined by NVCR\nWIP = 1\nWEL = 0WIP = 0\nWEL = 0512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nPower-Up and Power-Down\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.

Parameters listed are characterized only.\nPower Loss Recovery Sequence\nIf a power loss occurs during a WRITE NONVOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER\ncommand, after the next power-on, the device might begin in an undetermined state\n(XIP mode or an unnecessary protocol). If this occurs, until the next power-up, a recov-\nery sequence must reset the device to a fixed state (extended SPI protocol without XIP).\nAfter the recovery sequence, the issue should be resolved definitively by running the\nWRITE NONVOLATILE CONFIGURATION REGISTER command again. The recovery se-\nquence is composed of two parts that must be run in the correct order. During the en-\ntire sequence, tSHSL2 must be at least 50ns. The first part of the sequence is DQ0 (PAD\nDATA) and DQ3 (PAD HOLD) equal to 1 for the situations listed below:\n• 7 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 8th clock cycle)\n• + 9 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 10th clock cycle)\n• + 13 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 14th clock cycle)\n• + 17 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 18th clock cycle)\n• + 25 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 26th clock cycle)\n• + 33 clock cycles within S# LOW (S# becomes HIGH before 34th clock cycle)\nThe second part of the sequence is exiting from dual or quad SPI protocol by using the\nfollowing FFh sequence: DQ0 and DQ3 equal to 1 for 8 clock cycles within S# LOW; S#\nbecomes HIGH before 9th clock cycle.\nAfter this two-part sequence the extended SPI protocol is active.512Mb, Multiple I/O Serial Flash Memory\nPower-Up and Power-Down\n09005aef84752721\nn25q_512mb_1ce_3V_65nm.pdf - Rev.
