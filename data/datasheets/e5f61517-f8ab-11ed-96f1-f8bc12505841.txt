Higher values and lower ESR willimprove the overall line transient response.\nOutput Decoupling (C2)\nThe MC78LC00 is a stable component and does not\nrequire any specific Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) ora minimum output current. Capacitors exhibiting ESRs\nranging from a few m /C0087 up to 3.0 /C0087 can thus safely be used.\nThe minimum decoupling value is 0.1 /C0109F and can be\naugmented to fulfill stringent load transient requirements.The regulator accepts ceramic chip capacitors as well astantalum devices. Larger values improve noise rejection and\nload regulation transient response.\nHints\nPlease be sure the Vin and GND lines are sufficiently\nwide. When the impedance of these lines is high, there is achance to pick up noise or cause the regulator tomalfunction.\nSet external components, especially the output capacitor,\nas close as possible to the circuit, and make leads as short aspossible.Thermal\nAs power across the MC78LC00 increases, it might\nbecome necessary to provide some thermal relief. Themaximum power dissipation supported by the device isdependent upon board design and layout. Mounting padconfiguration on the PCB, the board material, and also the\nambient temperature effect the rate of temperature rise for\nthe part. This is stating that when the MC78LC00 has goodthermal conductivity through the PCB, the junctiontemperature will be relatively low with high powerdissipation applications.\nThe maximum dissipation the package can handle is\ngiven by:\nPD/C0043TJ(max) /C0042TA\nR/C0113JA\nIf junction temperature is not allowed above the\nmaximum 125 °C, then the MC78LC00NTR can dissipate\nup to 357 mW @ 25 °C.\nThe power dissipated by the MC78LC00NTR can be\ncalculated from the following equation:\nPtot/C0043/C0426Vin*Ignd(Iout)/C0427/C0041[Vin/C0042Vout]*Iout\nor\nVinMAX /C0043Ptot/C0041Vout*Iout\nIgnd/C0041Iout\nIf an 80 mA output current is needed then the ground\ncurrent from the data sheet is 1.1 /C0109A. For an\nMC78LC30NTR (3.0 V), the maximum input voltage willthen be 7.4 V .\nVout\nC2+C1+Battery or\nUnregulated\nVoltage\nFigure 20.

**Description:**
The MC78LC33NTRG is a low dropout linear voltage regulator designed to provide a fixed output voltage of 3.3 V. It is part of the MC78LC00 series, which is optimized for battery-powered and handheld communication devices due to its ultra-low quiescent current of 1.1 µA. The device integrates a voltage reference, error amplifier, PMOS power transistor, and resistors to set the output voltage.

**Typical Applications:**
The MC78LC33NTRG is commonly used in:
- Battery-powered instruments
- Hand-held devices
- Camcorders and cameras
- Any application requiring a stable 3.3 V power supply with low power consumption

This component is particularly suitable for applications where space is limited and efficiency is critical, making it ideal for portable electronics.
