Using a \nbuilt-in charge pump, the devices control two external \nback-to-back n-channel MOSFETs that turn off and  \nisolate downstream power supplies during damaging \ninput conditions, such as an automotive load-dump pulse \nor a reverse-battery condition. Operation is guaranteed \ndown to 3V to ensure proper operation during automotive \ncold-crank conditions. These devices feature a flag output \n(FLAG ) that asserts during fault conditions.\nFor reverse-voltage protection, external back-to-back \nMOSFETs outperform the traditional reverse-battery \ndiode, minimizing the voltage drop and power dissipation \nduring normal operation.\nThe MAX16126/MAX16127 use external resistors to \nadjust the overvoltage and undervoltage comparator \nthresholds for maximum flexibility.\nThe MAX16127 provides limiter-mode fault management \nfor overvoltage and thermal shutdown conditions; where as \nthe MAX16126 provides switch-mode fault management \nfor overvoltage and thermal shutdown conditions. In the \nlimiter mode, the output voltage is limited and FLAG  is \nasserted low during a fault. In the switch mode, the exter nal \nMOSFETs are switched off and FLAG  is asserted low \nafter a fault. The switch mode is available in four options: \nlatch mode, 1 autoretry mode, 3 autoretry mode, and \nalways autoretry mode.\nThe MAX16126/MAX16127 are available in 12-pin TQFN \npackages. These devices operate over the automotive \ntemperature range (-40°C to +125°C).Benefits and Features\n ●Increases Protection of Sensitive Electronic \nComponents in Harsh Environments\n• -36V to +90V Wide Input-Voltage Protection Range\n• Fast Gate Shutoff During Fault Conditions with \nComplete Load Isolation\n• Thermal-Shutdown Protection\n• Active-Low FLAG  Output Identifies Fault Condition\n ●AEC-Q100 Automotive Qualified\n• Operates Down to +3V, Riding Out Cold-Crank \nConditions\n• -40°C to +125°C Operating Temperature Range\n ●Integration Reduces Solution Size\n• Internal Charge-Pump Circuit Enhances External  \nn-Channel MOSFET\n• Adjustable Undervoltage/Overvoltage Thresholds\n• 3mm x 3mm, 12-Pin TQFN Package\n ●Reduced Power Dissipation Compared to Discrete \nSolutions\n• Minimal Operating Voltage Drop for Reverse-  \nVoltage Protection\n• 350μA (max) Supply Current and 100μA (max) \nShutdown Current at 30V Input\nApplications\n ●Automotive\n ●Industrial\n ●Avionics\n ●Telecom/Server/Networking\nOrdering Information  appears at end of data sheet.\n19-6053; Rev 14; 11/19Click here  for production status of specific part numbers.\nMAX16126/MAX16127 Load-Dump/Reverse-Voltage Protection Circuits \nEVALUATION KIT AVAILABLE\n(All pins referenced to GND.)\nIN  ............................................................................ -36V to +90V\nSHDN  ........................................... -0.3V to max (0V, V IN + 0.3V)\nTERM  ........................................... -0.3V to max (0V, V IN + 0.3V)\nSRC, GATE  ............................................................ -36V to +45V\nSRC to GATE  ......................................................... -36V to +36V\nOUT  ....................................................................... -0.3V to +45V\nFLAG  ..................................................................... -0.3V to +45V\nOVSET, UVSET  ....................................................... -0.3V to +6VContinuous Sink/Source (all pins)  .................................. ±100mA\nContinuous Power Dissipation (T A = +70°C) (multilayer board)  \nTQFN (derate 14.7mW/°C above +70°C) ............... 1176.5mW\nOperating Temperature Range  ......................... -40°C to +125°C\nJunction Temperature  ...................................................... +150°C\nStorage Temperature Range  ............................ -60°C to +150°C\nLead Temperature (soldering, 10s)  ................................. +300°C\nSoldering Temperature (reflow)  ....................................... +260°C\n(Note 1)\nTQFN  \nJunction-to-Ambient Thermal Resistance (θ JA) .....46.91°C/W   \nJunction-to-Case Thermal Resistance (θ JC) ............ 5.27°C/W\n(VIN = 12V, C GATE-SOURCE  = 1nF, T A = -40°C to +125°C, unless otherwise noted.

The devices monitor the input voltage and \ncontrol two external common-source n-channel MOSFETs \nto protect downstream voltage regulators during load-dump \nevents or other automotive pulse conditions.\nThe devices feature an overvoltage and an undervoltage \ncomparator for voltage window detection. A flag output \n(FLAG ) asserts when a fault event occurs.\nTwo external back-to-back n-channel MOSFETs provide \nreverse-voltage protection and also prevent reverse cur -\nrent during a fault condition. Compared to a traditional \nreverse-battery diode, this approach minimizes power dissipation and voltage drop, and allows the circuit to \noperate at very low cold-crank voltages (3V minimum).\nThe MAX16127 provides a limiter-mode fault manage -\nment for overvoltage and thermal shutdown conditions, \nwhereas the MAX16126 provides switch-mode fault \nmanagement for overvoltage and thermal shutdown con -\nditions. In the limiter mode, the MOSFETs cycle on and \noff so the output voltage is limited. In the switch mode, \nthe external MOSFETs are switched off, disconnecting \nthe load from the input. In both cases, FLAG  asserts to \nindicate a fault.\nGate Charge Pump\nThe MAX16126/MAX16127 use a charge pump to gener -\nate the GATE to SRC voltage and enhance the external \nMOSFETs. After the input voltage exceeds the input PIN NAME FUNCTION\n1 SHDNShutdown Input. Drive SHDN  low to force GATE and FLAG  low and turn off the external n-channel \nMOSFETs.

TERM is high impedance when \nSHDN  is low, forcing the current to zero in the resistive-divider connected to TERM.\n3 N.C. No Connection. Not internally connected.\n4 UVSETUndervoltage Threshold Adjustment Input. Connect UVSET to the external resistive voltage-divider \nnetwork to adjust the desired input undervoltage threshold. Connect the resistive divider to TERM.\n5 OVSETOvervoltage Threshold Adjustment Input. Connect OVSET to an external resistive voltage-divider network \nto adjust the desired overvoltage disable or overvoltage limit threshold. Connect the resistive divider to \nTERM for overvoltage switch-mode applications or to OUT for overvoltage limiting applications.\n6 GND Ground\n7 I.C. Internally Connected. Connect to GND.\n8 FLAGFLAG  Output. During startup, FLAG  is low as long as V OUT is lower than 90% of V IN and after that \nit is high impedance. It asserts low during shutdown mode, an overvoltage, thermal shutdown, or \nundervoltage fault or when V OUT falls below 90% of V IN. \n9 OUTOutput Voltage-Sense Input. Connect OUT to the load with a 100Ω series resistor. Bypass the load with a \nminimum 10µF capacitor to GND.\n10 SRCSource Input. Connect SRC to the common source connection of the external MOSFETs.

Connect GATE to the gates of the external n-channel MOSFETs. GATE is the \ncharge-pump output during normal operation.

Bypass IN with a \n0.1µF ceramic capacitor to GND.\n— EP Exposed Pad.

Note that an external zener \ndiode is required to be connected between the gate and \nsource of the external MOSFETs. See the Applications \nInformation  section.\nOvervoltage Protection\nThe MAX16126/MAX16127 detect overvoltage conditions \nusing a comparator that is connected through an external \nresistive divider to the input or output voltage. An overvolt -\nage condition causes the GATE output to go low, turning \noff the external MOSFETs. FLAG  also asserts to indicate \nthe fault condition.\nOvervoltage Limiter (MAX16127)\nIn overvoltage limiter mode, the output voltage is regu -\nlated at the overvoltage threshold voltage and continues \nto supply power to downstream devices. In this mode, the \ndevice operates like a voltage regulator.\nDuring normal operation, GATE is enhanced 9V above \nSRC. The output voltage is monitored through a resis -\ntive divider between OUT and OVSET. When OUT rises \nabove the overvoltage threshold, GATE goes low and the \nMOSFETs turn off. As the voltage on OUT falls below the \novervoltage threshold minus the threshold hysteresis, \nGATE goes high and the MOSFETs turn back on again, \nregulating OUT in a switched-linear mode at the overvolt -\nage threshold.\nThe switching frequency depends on the gate charge of \nthe MOSFETs, the charge-pump current, the output load \ncurrent, and the output capacitance.\nCaution must be exercised when operating the \nMAX16127 in voltage-limiting mode for long durations. \nSince MOSFETs can dissipate power continuously during \nthis interval, proper heat sinking should be implemented \nto prevent damage to them.\nOvervoltage Switch (MAX16126)\nIn the overvoltage switch mode, the internal overvolt -\nage comparator monitors the input voltage and the load \nis completely disconnected from the input during an \novervoltage event. When the input voltage exceeds the \novervoltage threshold, GATE goes low and the MOSFETs \nturn off, disconnecting the input from the load. After that, \nfor the autoretry mode version, the autoretry timer starts, \nwhile for the latched mode version a power cycle to IN or \na cycle on SHDN  is needed to turn the external MOSFETs \nback on.The MAX16126 can be configured to latch off (suffix D) \neven after the overvoltage condition ends. The latch is \ncleared by cycling IN below the undervoltage threshold or \nby toggling SHDN .\nThe devices can also be configured to retry:\n ●One time, then latch off (suffix B)\n ●Three times, then latch off (suffix C)\n ●Always retry and never latch off (suffix A)\nThere is a fixed 150ms (typ) delay between each retry \nattempt. If the overvoltage fault condition is gone when a \nretry is attempted, GATE goes high and power is restored \nto the downstream circuitry.\nUndervoltage Protection\nThe MAX16126/MAX16127 monitor the input voltage \nfor undervoltage conditions. If the input voltage is below \nthe undervoltage threshold (V IN < V TH - V TH-HYS ), \nGATE goes low, turning off the external MOSFETs and \nFLAG  asserts. When the input voltage exceeds the  \nundervoltage threshold (V IN > V TH), GATE goes high \nafter a 150µs delay (typ).\nFor the MAX16126/MAX16127, an external resistive \ndivider connected between TERM, UVSET, and GND \nsets the undervoltage threshold (TERM is connected to \nIN when SHDN  is high). \nThermal Shutdown\nThe MAX16126/MAX16127 thermal shutdown feature \nturns off the MOSFETs if the internal die tempera -\nture exceeds +145°C (T J). By ensuring good thermal  \ncoupling between the MOSFETs and the MAX16126/\nMAX16127, the thermal shutdown can turn off the \nMOSFETs if they overheat.\nWhen the junction temperature exceeds T J = +145°C \n(typ), the internal thermal sensor signals the shutdown \nlogic, pulling the GATE voltage low and allowing the \ndevice to cool. When T J drops by 15°C (typ), GATE goes \nhigh and the MOSFETs turn back on. Do not exceed \nthe absolute maximum junction-temperature rating of  \nTJ = +150°C.\nFlag Output ( FLAG )\nAn open-drain FLAG  output indicates fault conditions. \nDuring startup, FLAG  is initially low and goes high \nimpedance when V OUT is greater than 90% of V IN if no \nfault conditions are present. FLAG  asserts low during \nshutdown mode, an overvoltage, thermal shutdown, or \nundervoltage fault, or when V OUT falls below 90% of V IN.\nMAX16126/MAX16127 Load-Dump/Reverse-Voltage Protection Circuits \nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 9\nTERM Connection\nThe TERM connection has an internal switch to IN. \nIn shutdown ( SHDN  = GND), this switch is open. By  \nconnecting the voltage threshold resistive divider to \nTERM instead of directly to IN, power dissipation in the \nresistive divider can be eliminated and the shutdown  \nsupply current reduced.\nReverse-Voltage Protection\nThe MAX16126/MAX16127 integrate reverse-voltage  \nprotection, preventing damage to the downstream circuitry \ncaused by battery reversal or negative transients. The \ndevices can withstand reverse voltage to -36V without \ndamage to themselves or the load. During a reverse-  \nvoltage condition, the two external n-channel MOSFETs \nare turned off, protecting the load. Connect a 0.1µF \nceramic capacitor from IN to GND, connect 10µF from the \nload to GND, and minimize the parasitic capacitance from \nGATE to GND to have a fast reserve-battery voltage-tran -\nsient protection. During normal operation, both MOSFETs \nare turned on and have a minimal forward voltage drop,  \nproviding lower power dissipation and a much lower  \nvoltage drop than a reverse-battery protection diode.\nSupply Current During Fault Conditions\nDuring fault conditions, the MAX16126/MAX16127  \nsupply current is higher than normal operation. When a \nfault condition occurs, the MAX16126/MAX16127 pulls the \ngate low but keeps the charge pump active. This results \nin increased supply because the charge pump tries hard \nto bring up the gate. See Figures below for supply current \nduring overvoltage and undervotlage fault conditions.Applications Information\nAutomotive Electrical Transients  \n(Load Dump)\nAutomotive circuits generally require supply voltage \nprotection from various transient conditions that occur in \nautomotive systems. Several standards define various \npulses that can occur. Table 1  summarizes the pulses \nfrom the ISO 7637-2 and ISO 16750-2 specification.\nMost of the pulses can be mitigated with capacitors \nand zener clamp diodes (see the Typical Operating \nCharacteristics  and also the Increasing the Input Voltage \nProtection Range  section). The load dump (pulse 5a and \n5b) occurs when the alternator is charging the battery \nand a battery terminal gets disconnected. Due to the  \nsudden change in load, the alternator goes out of regula tion \nand the bus voltage spikes. The pulse has a rise time \nof about 10ms and a fall time of about 400ms, but can \nextend out to 1s or more depending on the characteris -\ntics of the charging system. The magnitude of the pulse \ndepends on the bus voltage and whether the system is \nunsuppressed or uses central load-dump suppression \n(generally implemented using very large clamp diodes \nbuilt into the alternator). Table 1  lists the worst-case  \nvalues from the ISO 7637-2 specification.\nCold crank (pulse 4) occurs when activating the starter \nmotor in cold weather with a marginal battery. Due to the \nlarge load imposed by the starter motor, the bus voltage \nsags.

The MAX16126 \noperates in switch mode in which the internal overvoltage \ncomparator monitors the input voltage. It uses three resis tors \nin a single resistive divider to set the undervoltage and \novervoltage thresholds. The top of the resistive divider \nconnects to TERM (see Figure 1 ).\nThe MAX16126 includes internal undervoltage and  \novervoltage comparators for window detection. GATE \nis enhanced and the n-channel MOSFETs are on when \nthe IN voltage is within the selected window. When the \nmonitored voltage falls below the lower limit (V TRIPLOW ) \nor exceeds the upper limit (V TRIPHIGH ) of the window, the \nGATE voltage goes to GND, turning off the MOSFETs. \nThe circuit in Figure 1  shows the MAX16126 enabling the \nDC-DC converter when the monitored voltage is in the \nselected window.The resistor values R1, R2, and R3 can be calculated as \nfollows:\nTOTALTRIPLOW TH TH-HYSRV (V - V )R2 R3\uf8eb\uf8f6= \uf8ec\uf8f7+\uf8ed\uf8f8\nTOTALTRIPHIGH THRVVR3\uf8eb\uf8f6=\uf8ec\uf8f7\uf8ed\uf8f8\nwhere R TOTAL  = R1 + R2 + R3, V TH is the 1.225V \nOVSET/UVSET threshold, and V TH-HYS  is the hysteresis. \nUse the following steps to determine the values for R1, \nR2, and R3:\n1) Choose a value for R TOTAL , the sum of R1, R2, and \nR3.\n2) Calculate R3 based on R TOTAL  and the desired upper \ntrip point:\nTH TOTAL\nTRIPHIGHVRR3V×=\n3) Calculate R2 based on R TOTAL , R3, and the desired \nlower trip point:\nTH TH-HYS TOTAL\nTRIPLOW(V - V ) RR2 - R3V×=\n4) Calculate R1 based on R TOTAL , R2, and R3:\nTOTAL R1 R - R2 - R3=Table 1.

The top of the overvoltage divider \nconnects to OUT and the top of the undervoltage divider \nconnects to TERM (see Figure 2 ).\nUse the following formula to calculate R4:\nTOTAL_OV\nTH\nOVRR4 VV= ×\nwhere R TOTAL_OV  = R3 + R4, V TH is the 1.225V OVSET \nrising threshold, and V OV is the desired overvoltage \nthreshold. The falling threshold of V TH is 5% below the \nrising threshold.\nSimilarly, to calculate the values of R1 and R2:\nTOTAL_UV\nTH TH-HYS\nUVRR2 (V - V )V= ×where R TOTAL_UV  = R1 + R2, V TH is the 1.225V UVSET \nrising threshold, V TH-HYS is the hysteresis, and V UV is \nthe desired undervoltage threshold.\nUse the nearest standard-value resistor that is less \nthan the calculated value. A lower value for total resis -\ntance dissipates more power, but provides slightly better  \naccuracy.\nMOSFET Selection\nMOSFET selection is critical to design a proper protec -\ntion circuit. Several factors must be taken into account: \nthe gate capacitance, the drain-to-source voltage rating, \nthe on-resistance (R DS(ON) ), the peak power dissipation \ncapability, and the average power dissipation limit. In gen -\neral, both MOSFETs should have the same part number. \nFor size-constrained applications, a dual MOSFET can \nsave board area. Select the drain-to-source voltage so \nthat the MOSFETs can handle the highest voltage that \nmight be applied to the circuit. Gate capacitance is not as \ncritical, but it does determine the maximum turn-on and \nturn-off time. MOSFETs with more gate capacitance tend \nto respond more slowly.Figure 1.

Power  \ndissipation (per MOSFET) during normal operation can be \ncalculated using this formula:\nP = ILOAD2 x RDS(ON)\nwhere P is the power dissipated in each MOSFET and \nILOAD  is the average load current.\nDuring a fault condition in switch mode, the MOSFETs \nturn off and do not dissipate power. Limiter mode  \nimposes the worst-case power dissipation. The average \npower can be computed using the following formula:\nP = I LOAD x (VIN - VOUT)\nwhere P is the average power dissipated in both \nMOSFETs, I LOAD is the average load current, V IN is the \ninput voltage, and V OUT is the average limited voltage \non the output. In limiter mode, the output voltage is a \nsawtooth wave with characteristics determined by the \nRDS(ON)  of the MOSFETs, the output load current, the \noutput capacitance, the gate charge of the MOSFETs, \nand the GATE charge-pump current.\nSince limiter mode can involve high switching currents \nwhen the GATE is turning on at the start of a limiting \ncycle (especially when the output capacitance is high), it \nis important to ensure the circuit does not violate the peak power rating of the MOSFETs. Check the pulse power  \nratings in the MOSFET data sheet.\nMOSFET Gate Protection\nTo protect the gate of the MOSFETs, connect a zener \nclamp diode from the gate to the source. The cathode \nconnects to the gate, and the anode connects to the \nsource. Choose the zener clamp voltage to be above 10V \nand below the MOSFET V GS maximum rating.\nIncreasing the  \nInput Voltage Protection Range\nThe MAX16126/MAX16127 can tolerate -36V to +90V. \nTo increase the positive input voltage range protection, \nconnect two back-to-back zener diodes from IN to system \nground, and connect a resistor in series with IN and the \npower-supply input to limit the current drawn by the zener \ndiodes (see Figure 3 ).\nZener diode D1 clamps positive voltage excursions and \nD2 clamps negative  voltage excursions. Set the zener \nvoltages so the worst-case voltages do not exceed the \nratings of the part. Also ensure that the zener diode power \nratings are not exceeded. The combination of the series \nresistor and the zener diodes also help snub pulses on \nthe supply voltage input and can aid in clamping the low-\nenergy ISO 7637-2 pulses.Figure 2.

Most standard surface-mount  \nresistors cannot withstand the peak power dissipation \nduring certain pulse events. Check the resistor data \nsheets for pulse power derating curves. If necessary,  \nconnect multiple resistors in parallel or use automotive-\nrated resistors. \nThe shutdown input needs a series resistor to limit the \ncurrent if V IN exceeds the clamped voltage on IN. A good \nstarting point is 100kΩ\nIncreasing the  \nInput Voltage Operating Range\nWith proper external component selection, the MAX16126/\nMAX16127’s input voltage operating range can be extend ed \nbeyond 30V. Normally the input voltage can swing up to \n90V in protection mode, but normal operation is listed in \nthe electrical characteristics table to 30V. Higher voltage \noperation is permissible so long as the resulting GATE \nbias voltage does not exceed 45V with respect to GND.\nTo enable operating voltages above 30V, a 6.8V \nZener diode clamp can be added GATE-to-SRC to the  \nexternal switches to limit the maximum GATE voltage. The circuit in Figure 4  shows the recommended arrange -\nment. When V IN = 35V, V GATE  = 35V + 6.8V or 41.8V. \nWhen V IN > 35V, the MAX16126/MAX16127 detects \nthe input over voltage condition by sensing the voltage \nat the OVSET pin and turns off the charge pump. The \nresistive voltage divider on OVSET must be selected to \ndisable the circuit before the gate voltage reaches 45V. \nThe MAX16126TCA/MAX16127TCA automatically reen -\nable GATE drive when the input voltage drops 5% below \nthe overvoltage threshold. For the MAX16126TCD, the \nlatch-mode option, GATE drive is enabled by either power \ncycling the IN voltage below UVLO threshold or by tog -\ngling SHDN . See the Ordering Information  section for \nother available options.\nOutput Reservoir Capacitor\nThe output capacitor can be used as a reservoir capaci tor \nto allow downstream circuitry to ride out fault transient \nconditions. Since the voltage at the output is protected \nfrom input voltage transients, the capacitor voltage rating \ncan be less than the expected maximum input voltage.\nFigure 3.
