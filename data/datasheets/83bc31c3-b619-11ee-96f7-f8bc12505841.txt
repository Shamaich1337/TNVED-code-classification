This allows for translation from a 3.3-V to a 5-V \nenvironment, and vice versa.\nThe SN74LVC4245A device is designed for \nasynchronous communication between data buses. \nThe device transmits data from the A bus to the \nB bus or from the B bus to the A bus, depending \non the logic level at the direction-control (DIR) input. \nThe output-enable ( OE) input can be used to disable \nthe device so the buses are effectively isolated.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74LVC4245A device pinout allows the designer to switch to a normal all-3.3-V or all-5-V 20-pin \n\'245 device without board re-layout. The designer uses the data paths for pins 2–11 and 14–23 of the \nSN74LVC4245A to align with the conventional SN74LVC4245 device\'s pinout. SN74LVC4245A is a high drive \nCMOS device that can be used for a multitude of bus interface type applications where output drive or PCB trace \nlength is a concern.\n9.2 Typical Application\n\x1dC or System \nLogic A1\nA8B1\nB8VCCB\nGND\x1dC/System \nLogic/LEDs3 V 5 V\nOEVCCA\nDIR\nFigure 9-1.

Care should be taken to avoid bus \ncontention because it can drive currents that would exceed maximum limits. The high drive will also create \nfast edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing.\nwww.ti.comSN74LVC4245A\nSCAS375J – MARCH 1994 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC4245A\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1.Recommended Input Conditions:\n•For rise time and fall time specifcations, see (Δt/ΔV) in the Section 6.4 table.\n•For specified high and low levels, see (V IH and V IL) in the Section 6.4 table.\n2.Recommend Output Conditions:\n•Load currents should not exceed (I O max) per output and should not exceed (Continuous current through \nVCC or GND) total current for the part.

A proper power-up \nsequence always should be followed to avoid excessive supply current, bus contention, oscillations, or other \nanomalies caused by improperly biased device terminals. Take these precautions to guard against such power-\nup problems:\n1.Connect ground before any supply voltage is applied.\n2.Power up the control side of the device (V CCA for all four of these devices).\n3.Tie OE to V CCA with a pullup resistor so that it ramps with V CCA.\n4.Depending on the direction of the data path, DIR can be high or low. If DIR high is needed (A data to B bus), \nramp it with V CCA. Otherwise, keep DIR low.\nFor more information, refer to the Voltage-Level-Translation Devices  application note.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple bit logic devices, inputs should not float. In many cases, functions or parts of functions of \ndigital logic devices are unused. Some examples are when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used, \nor when only 3 of the 4-buffer gates are used. Such input pins should not be left unconnected because the \nundefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states.\nSpecified in Figure 11-1  are rules that must be observed under all circumstances. All unused inputs of digital \nlogic devices must be connected to a high or low bias to prevent them from floating. The logic level that should \nbe applied to any particular unused input depends on the function of the device. Generally they will be tied to \nGND or V CC, whichever makes more sense or is more convenient.\n11.2 Layout Example\nVCC\nUnused Input\nInputOutput OutputInput\nUnused Input\nFigure 11-1.

#### Description:
The SN74LVC4245A is an octal (8-bit) non-inverting bus transceiver designed for asynchronous communication between data buses. It features two separate supply rails, allowing for voltage translation between a 3.3 V environment (B port) and a 5 V environment (A port). The device can transmit data in either direction, depending on the logic level at the direction-control (DIR) input. It also includes an output-enable (OE) input to disable the device, effectively isolating the buses.

#### Typical Applications:
The SN74LVC4245A is suitable for a wide range of applications, including:
- **Data Communication:** Used in systems requiring communication between devices operating at different voltage levels.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Applications in devices such as cameras, digital signage, and remote controls.
- **Medical Equipment:** Utilized in devices like CT scanners, ECGs, and X-ray machines.
- **Industrial Applications:** Employed in field transmitters for pressure and temperature sensors.
- **High-Speed Data Acquisition:** Ideal for systems requiring fast data transfer and processing.

This component is particularly useful in mixed-voltage systems where signal integrity and level shifting are critical for proper operation.
