N/ABourns now offers a surface mount (SM) 3-electrode Gas Discharge Tube (GDT) surge protection device. The high quality and outstanding  \nfeatures of the Bourns® miniature 2036 TRIGARD™ series GDT continue in this new SM version for ‘pick and place’ manufacturing techniques. \nThe 2036 SM device is ideal for board level protection of high bandwidth applications such as xDSL, cable broadband and high speed Ethernet. \nIt has high energy handling capability, long and stable life performance, low capacitance of less than 2 pF, and measures only 5 mm in diameter. \nBourns® GDTs are designed to prevent damage from transient disturbances by acting as a “crowbar” in creating a short-to-ground circuit  \nduring conduction. When a voltage transient surge exceeds the defined breakdown voltage level of the GDT , the device becomes ionized and \nconduction takes place within a fraction of a microsecond. When the surge passes and system voltage returns to normal levels, the GDT returns \nto its high-impedance (off) state.\nCharacteristicModel No.\n2036-07 2036-09 2036-15 2036-20 2036-23 2036-25\nDC Sparkover ±20 % @ 100 V/s 75 V 90 V 150 V 200 V 230 V 250 V\nImpulse Sparkover (1)\n     100 V/µs \n     1000 V/µs250 V\n525 V250 V\n550 V350 V\n500 V425 V\n575 V450 V\n600 V475 V\n625 V\nCharacteristicModel No.\n2036-30 2036-35 2036-40 2036-42 2036-47 2036-60\nDC Sparkover ±20 % @ 100 V/s 300 V 350 V 400 V 420 V 470 V 600 V\nImpulse Sparkover (1)\n     100 V/µs \n     1000 V/µs500 V\n650 V600 V\n750 V650 V\n825 V675 V\n850 V750 V\n950 V850 V\n1100 V\n(1)  Impulse Sparkover voltage is defined as typical values of distribution.\nNotes: \n• Recognized per UL 497B (File: E153537)\n•  No model number marking on tube; date code and voltage only: month  \n year digits, xxxV (e.g. 0209 400V).\n• The rated discharge current for Mini-TRIGARD™ GDTs is the total  \n current equally divided between each line to ground.\n• Surface Mount (SM) parts may show a temporary increase in DCBD after  \n the solder reflow process.
