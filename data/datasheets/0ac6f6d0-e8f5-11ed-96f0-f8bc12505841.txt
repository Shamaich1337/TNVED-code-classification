It is a complete 500 MHz monolithic \ndemodulating logarithmic amplifier based on the progressive compression (successive detection) technique, providing a dynamic range of 92 dB to ±3 dB law conformance and 88 dB \nto a tight ±1 dB error bound at all frequencies up to 100 MHz. \nThe AD8307 is extremely stable and easy to use, requiring no \nsignificant external components. A single-supply voltage of 2.7 V to 5.5 V at 7.5 mA is needed. A fast acting CMOS-compatible control pin can disable the AD8307  to a standby \ncurrent of 150 μA. \nThe AD8307 operates over the industrial temperature range of \n−40°C to +85°C and is available in an 8-lead SOIC package and \nan 8-lead PDIP .

F | Page 9 of 24 LOG AMP THEORY \nLogarithmic amplifiers perform a more complex operation than \nthat of classical linear amplifiers, and their circuitry is significantly different. A good grasp of what log amps do and how they work can prevent many pitfalls in their application. The essential purpose \nof a log amp is not to amplify, though amplification is utilized to \nachieve the function. Rather, it is to compress a signal of wide dynamic range to its decibel equivalent. It is thus a measurement device. A better term may be logarithmic converter, because its basic function is the conversion of a signal from one domain of \nrepresentation to another via a precise nonlinear transformation. \nLogarithmic compression leads to situations that can be confusing \nor paradoxical. For example, a voltage offset added to the output \nof a log amp is equivalent to a gain increase ahead of its input. In the usual case where all the variables are voltages, and regardless of the particular structure, the relationship between the variables can be expressed as \n) / ( log     X IN Y OUT V V V V \uf03d  (1) \nwhere: \nVOUT is the output voltage. \nVY is the slope voltage; the logarithm is usually taken to base 10 \n(in which case VY is also the volts per decade). \nVIN is the input voltage. \nVX is the intercept voltage. \nAll log amps implicitly require two references, in this example, V\nX and V Y, which determine the scaling of the circuit. The abso-\nlute accuracy of a log amp cannot be any better than the accuracy \nof its scaling references. Equation 1 is mathematically incomplete in representing the behavior of a demodulating log amp, such  as the AD8307, where V\nIN has an alternating sign. However, the \nbasic principles are unaffected, and this can be safely used as the starting point in the analyses of log amp scaling. \nVOUT\n5VY\n4VY\n3VY\n2VY\n–2VYVY\nVOUT = 0VSHIFT\nLOWER INTERCEPT\nVIN = VX\n0dBcVIN = 102VX\n+40dBcVIN = 104VX\n+80dBcLOG VIN\n01082-021VIN = 10–2VX\n–40dBc\n \nFigure 21. Ideal Log Amp Function \nFigure 21 shows the input/output relationship of an ideal log amp, conforming to Equation 1. The horizontal scale is logarithmic and \nspans a wide dynamic range, shown in Figure 21 as over 120 dB, or \nsix decades. The output passes through zero (the log intercept) at the unique value V\nIN = V X and ideally becomes negative for \ninputs below the intercept. In the ideal case, the straight line describing V OUT for all values of V IN continues indefinitely in both \ndirections. The dotted line shows that the effect of adding an offset voltage, V\nSHIFT, to the output is to lower the effective intercept \nvoltage, V X. Exactly the same alteration can be achieved by raising \nthe gain (or signal level) ahead of the log amp by the factor, V\nSHIFT/V Y. For example, if V Y is 500 mV per decade (25 mV/dB), \nan offset of 150 mV added to the output appears to lower the intercept by two-tenths of a decade, or 6 dB. Adding an offset to the output is thus indistinguishable from applying an input level \nthat is 6 dB higher. \nThe log amp function described by Equation 1 differs from that \nof a linear amplifier in that the incremental gain δV\nOUT/δV IN is a \nvery strong function of the instantaneous value of V IN, as is \napparent by calculating the derivative. For the case where the \nlogarithmic base is δ, \nINY\nINOUT\nVV\nVV\uf03d\uf064\uf064 (2) \nThat is, the incremental gain is inversely proportional to the \ninstantaneous value of the input voltage. This remains true  \nfor any logarithmic base, which is chosen as 10 for all decibel related purposes. It follows that a perfect log amp is required to have infinite gain under classical small signal (zero amplitude) conditions. Less ideally, this result indicates that whatever \nmeans are used to implement a log amp, accurate response \nunder small signal conditions (that is, at the lower end of the dynamic range) demands the provision of a very high gain bandwidth product. A further consequence of this high gain is that in the absence of an input signal, even very small amounts of thermal noise at the input of a log amp cause a finite output \nfor zero input. This results in the response line curving away \nfrom the ideal shown in Figure 21 toward a finite baseline, which can be either above or below the intercept. Note that the value given for this intercept can be an extrapolated value, in which case the output cannot cross zero, or even reach it, as is \nthe case for the AD8307. \nWhile Equation 1 is fundamentally correct, a simpler formula is appropriate for specifying the calibration attributes of a log amp \nlike the AD8307, which demodulates a sine wave input. \nV\nOUT = V SLOPE (P IN – P 0) (3) \nwhere: \nVOUT is the demodulated and filtered baseband (video or \nRSSI) output. \nVSLOPE is the logarithmic slope, now expressed in V/dB (typically \nbetween 15 mV/dB and 30 mV/dB). \nPIN is the input power, expressed in decibels relative to some \nreference power level. P\n0 is the logarithmic intercept, expressed in decibels relative to \nthe same reference level. \nThe most widely used reference in RF systems is decibels above \n1 mW in 50 Ω, written dBm. Note that the quantity (P IN – P 0) is \nAD8307 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 10 of 24 just dB. The logarithmic function disappears from the formula \nbecause the conversion has already been implicitly performed in stating the input in decibels. This is strictly a concession to popular convention; log amps manifestly do not respond to power \n(tacitly, power absorbed at the input), but rather to input voltage. \nThe use of dBV (decibels with respect to 1 V rms) is more precise, though still incomplete, because waveform is involved as well. Because most users think about and specify RF signals in terms of power, more specifically, in dBm re: 50 Ω, this convention is \nused in specifying the performance of the AD8307. \nPROGRESSIVE COMPRESSION \nMost high speed, high dynamic range log amps use a cascade of \nnonlinear amplifier cells (see Figure 22) to generate the logarithmic \nfunction from a series of contiguous segments, a type of piecewise \nlinear technique. This basic topology immediately opens up the possibility of enormous gain bandwidth products. For example, the AD8307 employs six cells in its main signal path, each having  \na small signal gain of 14.3 dB (×5.2) and a −3 dB bandwidth of \nabout 900 MHz. The overall gain is about 20,000 (86 dB) and \nthe overall bandwidth of the chain is some 500 MHz, resulting in the incredible gain bandwidth product (GBW) of 10,000 GHz, about a million times that of a typical op amp. This very high GBW is an essential prerequisite for accurate operation under \nsmall signal conditions and at high frequencies. In Equation 2, \nhowever, the incremental gain decreases rapidly as V\nIN increases. \nThe AD8307 continues to exhibit an essentially logarithmic \nresponse down to inputs as small as 50 μV at 500 MHz.  \nVX VWSTAGE 1 STAGE 2 STAGE N–1 STAGE N\nA A A A\n01082-022 \nFigure 22. Cascade of Nonlinear Gain Cells \nTo develop the theory, first consider a scheme slightly different from that employed in the AD8307, but simpler to explain and \nmathematically more straightforward to analyze. This approach is based on a nonlinear amplifier unit, called an A/1 cell, with \nthe transfer characteristic shown in Figure 23.  \nThe local small signal gain δV\nOUT/δV IN is A, maintained for all \ninputs up to the knee voltage E K, above which the incremental \ngain drops to unity. The function is symmetrical: the same drop \nin gain occurs for instantaneous values of V IN less than –E K. The \nlarge signal gain has a value of A for inputs in the range −E K ≤ \nVIN ≤ +E K, but falls asymptotically toward unity for very large \ninputs. In logarithmic amplifiers based on this amplifier function, both the slope voltage and the intercept voltage must be traceable to the one reference voltage, E\nK. Therefore, in this fundamental \nanalysis, the calibration accuracy of the log amp is dependent solely on this voltage. In practice, it is possible to separate the \nbasic references used to determine V\nY and V X and, in the case of \nthe AD8307, V Y is traceable to an on-chip band gap reference, \nwhereas V X is derived from the thermal voltage kT/q and is later \ntemperature corrected. \n01082-023SLOPE = ASLOPE = 1OUTPUTAEK\nEK0\nINPUTA/1\n \nFigure 23. A/1 Amplifier Function \nLet the input of an N-cell cascade be V IN, and the final output  \nbe V OUT. For small signals, the overall gain is simply AN. A  \nsix-stage system in which A = 5 (14 dB) has an overall gain  \nof 15,625 (84 dB). The importance of a very high small signal \ngain in implementing the logarithmic function has been noted; \nhowever, this parameter is only of incidental interest in the design of log amps. \nFrom this point forward, rather than considering gain, analyze \nthe overall nonlinear behavior of the cascade in response to a simple dc input, corresponding to the V\nIN of Equation 1. For \nvery small inputs, the output from the first cell is V 1 = AV IN. \nThe output from the second cell is V 2 = A2 VIN, and so on, up to \nVN = AN VIN. At a certain value of V IN, the input to the Nth cell, \nVN − 1, is exactly equal to the knee voltage E K. Thus, V OUT = AE K \nand because there are N − 1 cells of Gain A ahead of this node, calculate V\nIN = E K /AN − 1. This unique situation corresponds to \nthe lin-log transition (labeled 1 in Figure 24). Below this input, the cascade of gain cells acts as a simple linear amplifier, whereas for higher values of V\nIN, it enters into a series of segments that \nlie on a logarithmic approximation (dotted line). \nRATIO\nOF A2\n13\n3\n2\nEK/AN–1 EK/AN–2 EK/AN–3 EK/AN–4LOG V IN(4A–3) E KVOUT\n(3A–2) E K\n(2A–1) E K\nAEK\n0(A–1) E K\n01082-024 \nFigure 24. First Three Transitions \nContinuing this analysis, the next transition occurs when the input to the N − 1 stage just reaches E\nK, that is, when V IN =  \nEK/AN − 2. The output of this stage is then exactly AE K, and it is \neasily demonstrated (from the function shown in Figure 23) that the output of the final stage is (2A − 1)E\nK (labeled 2 in Figure 24). \nThus, the output has changed by an amount (A − 1)E K for a \nchange in V IN from E K/AN − 1 to E K/AN − 2, that is, a ratio change of A. \nAt the next critical point (labeled 3 in Figure 24), the input is \nagain A times larger and V OUT has increased to (3A − 2)E K, that \nis, by another linear increment of (A − 1)E K.  \nData Sheet AD8307\n \nRev. F | Page 11 of 24 Further analysis shows that right up to the point where the input to \nthe first cell is above the knee voltage, V OUT changes by (A − 1)E K \nfor a ratio change of A in V IN. This can be expressed as a certain \nfraction of a decade, which is simply log 10(A). For example, \nwhen A = 5, a transition in the piecewise linear output function occurs at regular intervals of 0.7 decade (log\n10(A), or 14 dB \ndivided by 20 dB). This insight immediately allows the user to write the volts per decade scaling parameter, which is also the scaling voltage, V\nY, when using base 10 logarithms, as \n\uf028\uf029\n) ( log1\n10AE A\nV in Change DecadesV in Change LinearVK\nINOUT\nY\uf02d\uf03d \uf03d  (4) \nNote that only two design parameters are involved in determining V\nY, namely, the cell gain A and the knee voltage, E K, while N, \nthe number of stages, is unimportant in setting the slope of the overall function. For A = 5 and E\nK = 100 mV , the slope would be \na rather awkward 572.3 mV per decade (28.6 mV/dB). A well designed log amp has rational scaling parameters. \nThe intercept voltage can be determined by using two pairs of \ntransition points on the output function (consider Figure 24). The result is \n\uf028\uf029 ) 1 / 1 (\uf02d \uf02b\uf03dA NK\nXAEV  (5) \nFor the case under consideration, using N = 6, calculate V Z = \n4.28 μV . However, be careful about the interpretation of this parameter, because it was earlier defined as the input voltage at which the output passes through zero (see Figure 21). Clearly, in the absence of noise and offsets, the output of the amplifier chain \nshown in Figure 23 can be zero when, and only when, V\nIN = 0. \nThis anomaly is due to the finite gain of the cascaded amplifier, \nwhich results in a failure to maintain the logarithmic approximation below the lin-log transition (labeled 1 in Figure 24). Closer analysis shows that the voltage given by Equation 5 \nrepresents the extrapolated, rather than actual, intercept. \nDEMODULATING LOG AMPS \nLog amps based on a cascade of A/1 cells are useful in baseband \napplications because they do not demodulate their input signal. However, baseband and demodulating log amps alike can be made using a different type of amplifier stage, called an A/0 cell. Its function differs from that of the A/1 cell in that the gain above the knee voltage E\nK falls to zero, as shown by the solid \nline in Figure 25. This is also known as the limiter function, and a chain of N such cells are often used to generate hard-limited output in recovering the signal in FM and PM modes. \n01082-025SLOPE = ASLOPE = 0OUTPUTAEK\n0\nEK INPUTA/0tanh\n \nFigure 25. A/0 Amplifier Functions (Ideal and Tanh) \nThe AD640, AD606 , AD608 , AD8307, and various other Analog \nDevices, Inc., communications products incorporating a logarith-mic intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier all use this technique. It becomes apparent that the output of the last stage can no longer provide the logarithmic output because this remains unchanged for all inputs above the limiting threshold, which occurs at V\nIN = \nEK/AN − 1. Instead, the logarithmic output is now generated by \nsumming the outputs of all the stages. The full analysis for this type of log amp is only slightly more complicated than that of the previous case. It is readily shown that, for practical purposes, the intercept voltage, V\nX, is identical to that given in Equation 5, \nwhile the slope voltage is \n\uf028\uf029AAEVK\nY\n10log\uf03d  (6) \nPreference for the A/0 style of log amp over one using A/1 cells stems from several considerations. The first is that an A/0 cell can be very simple. In the AD8307, it is based on a bipolar \ntransistor differential pair, having resistive loads, R\nL, and an \nemitter current source, I E. This exhibits an equivalent knee \nvoltage of E K = 2 kT/q and a small signal gain of A = I ERL/EK. \nThe large signal transfer function is the hyperbolic tangent (see the dashed line in Figure 25). This function is very precise, and the deviation from an ideal A/0 form is not detrimental. In fact, \nthe rounded shoulders of the tanh function result in a lower \nripple in the logarithmic conformance than that obtained using an ideal A/0 function. \nAn amplifier composed of these cells is entirely differential in \nstructure and can thus be rendered very insensitive to disturbances on the supply lines and, with careful design, to temperature variations. The output of each gain cell has an associated \ntransconductance (g\nm) cell that converts the differential output \nvoltage of the cell to a pair of differential currents, which are \nsummed simply by connecting the outputs of all the g m (detector) \nstages in parallel. The total current is then converted back to a voltage by a transresistance stage to generate the logarithmic output. This scheme is depicted in single-sided form in Figure 26. \nAD8307 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 12 of 24 01082-026VIN VLIM\nIOUTA/0\ngmA/0\ngmA/0\ngmA/0\ngm gmAVIN A2VIN A3VIN A4VIN\n \nFigure 26. Log Amp Using A/0 Stages and Auxiliary Summing Cells \nThe chief advantage of this approach is that the slope voltage can \nnow be decoupled from the knee voltage, E K = 2 kT/q, which is \ninherently PTAT. By contrast, the simple summation of the cell outputs results in a very high temperature coefficient of the slope voltage given in Equation 6. To do this, the detector stages \nare biased with currents (not shown), which are rendered stable \nwith temperature. These are derived either from the supply voltage (as in the AD606 and AD608) or from an internal band gap \nreference (as in the AD640 and AD8307). This topology affords \ncomplete control over the magnitude and temperature behavior \nof the logarithmic slope, decoupling it completely from E\nK. \nA further step is needed to achieve the demodulation response, required when the log amp converts an alternating input into a \nquasi-dc baseband output. This is achieved by altering the g\nm \ncells used for summation purposes to also implement the rectifica-tion function. Early discrete log amps based on the progressive compression technique used half-wave rectifiers. This made \npostdetection filtering difficult. The AD640 was the first \ncommercial monolithic log amp to use a full-wave rectifier, a \npractice followed in all subsequent Analog Devices types.  \nThese detectors can be modeled as essentially linear g\nm cells, but \nproduce an output current independent of the sign of the voltage \napplied to the input of each cell; that is, they implement the absolute value function. Because the output from the later A/0 \nstages closely approximates an amplitude symmetric square \nwave for even moderate input levels (most stages of the amplifier chain operate in a limiting mode), the current output from  each detector is almost constant over each period of the input. \nSomewhat earlier detector stages produce a waveform having \nonly very brief dropouts, whereas the detectors nearest the \ninput produce a low level, almost sinusoidal waveform at twice the input frequency. These aspects of the detector system result in a signal that is easily filtered, resulting in low residual ripple on the output. \nINTERCEPT CALIBRATION \nAll monolithic log amps from Analog Devices include accurate means to position the intercept voltage, V\nX (or equivalent power for \na demodulating log amp). Using the scheme shown in Figure 26, \nthe basic value of the intercept level departs considerably from \nthat predicted by the simpler analyses given earlier. However, the intrinsic intercept voltage is still proportional to E\nK, which is \nPTAT (see Equation 5). Recalling that the addition of an offset to the output produces an effect that is indistinguishable from a \nchange in the position of the intercept, it is possible to cancel \nthe left-right motion of V\nX resulting from the temperature variation of E K. Do this by adding an offset with the required \ntemperature behavior. \nThe precise temperature shaping of the intercept positioning offset \nresults in a log amp having stable scaling parameters, making it a true measurement device, for example, as a calibrated received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In this application, the user is \nmore interested in the value of the output for an input waveform \nthat is invariably sinusoidal. Although the input level can alterna-tively be stated as an equivalent power, in dBm, be sure to work carefully. It is essential to know the load impedance in which this power is presumed to be measured. \nIn radio frequency (RF) practice, it is generally safe to assume a \nreference impedance of 50 Ω in which 0 dBm (1 mW) corresponds \nto a sinusoidal amplitude of 316.2 mV (223.6 mV rms). The intercept can likewise be specified in dBm. For the AD8307, it is \npositioned at −84 dBm, corresponding to a sine amplitude of 20 μV . It is important to bear in mind that log amps do not respond to power, but to the voltage applied to their input. \nThe AD8307 presents a nominal input impedance much higher \nthan 50 Ω (typically 1.1 kΩ low frequencies). A simple input \nmatching network can considerably improve the sensitivity of \nthis type of log amp. This increases the voltage applied to the input and thus alters the intercept. For a 50 Ω match, the voltage gain is 4.8 and the entire dynamic range moves down by 13.6 dB (see Figure 35). Note that the effective intercept is a function of \nwaveform. For example, a square wave input reads 6 dB higher \nthan a sine wave of the same amplitude and a Gaussian noise input 0.5 dB higher than a sine wave of the same rms value. \nOFFSET CONTROL \nIn a monolithic log amp, direct coupling between the stages is used for several reasons. First, this avoids the use of coupling capacitors, which typically have a chip area equal to that of a basic gain cell, thus considerably increasing die size. Second, the capacitor values predetermine the lowest frequency at which the \nlog amp can operate; for moderate values, this can be as high as \n30 MHz, limiting the application range. Third, the parasitic (backplate) capacitance lowers the bandwidth of the cell, further limiting the applications.  \nHowever, the very high dc gain of a direct-coupled amplifier \nraises a practical issue. An offset voltage in the early stages of the chain is indistinguishable from a real signal. For example, if \nit were as high as 400 μV , it would be 18 dB larger than the \nsmallest ac signal (50 μV), potentially reducing the dynamic range by this amount. This problem is averted by using a global feedback path from the last stage to the first, which corrects this offset in a similar fashion to the dc negative feedback applied \naround an op amp. The high frequency components of the \nsignal must be removed to prevent a reduction of the HF gain in the forward path. \n  \nData Sheet AD8307\n \nRev. F | Page 13 of 24 In the AD8307, this is achieved by an on-chip filter, providing \nsufficient suppression of HF feedback to allow operation above \n1 MHz. To extend the range below this frequency, an external capacitor can be added. This permits the high-pass corner to be \nlowered to audio frequencies using a capacitor of modest value. \nNote that this capacitor has no effect on the minimum signal frequency for input levels above the offset voltage; this extends down to dc (for a signal applied directly to the input pins). The offset voltage varies from part to part; some exhibit essentially \nstable offsets of under 100 μV without the benefit of an offset \nadjustment. \nEXTENSION OF RANGE \nThe theoretical dynamic range for the basic log amp shown in Figure 26 is A\nN. For A = 5.2 (14.3 dB) and N = 6, it is 20,000 or \n86 dB. The actual lower end of the dynamic range is largely determined by the thermal noise floor, measured at the input of the chain of amplifiers. The upper end of the range is extended upward by the addition of top-end detectors. The input signal is applied to a tapped attenuator, and progressively smaller signals are applied to three passive rectifying g\nm cells whose outputs are \nsummed with those of the main detectors. With care in design, \nthe extension to the dynamic range can be seamless over the full \nfrequency range. For the AD8307, it amounts to a further 27 dB. \nTherefore, the total dynamic range is theoretically 113 dB. The specified range of 90 dB (−74 dBm to +16 dBm) is for high accuracy and calibrated operation, and includes the low end degradation due to thermal noise and the top end reduction due to voltage limitations. The additional stages are not redundant, but \nare needed to maintain accurate logarithmic conformance over \nthe central region of the dynamic range, and in extending the usable range considerably beyond the specified range. In applications where log conformance is less demanding, the AD8307 can provide over 95 dB of range. \n \nAD8307 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 14 of 24 INTERFACES \nThe AD8307 comprises six main amplifier/limiter stages, each \nhaving a gain of 14.3 dB and small signal bandwidth of 900 MHz; \nthe overall gain is 86 dB with a −3 dB bandwidth of 500 MHz. These six cells and their associated g\nm styled full-wave detectors \nhandle the lower two-thirds of the dynamic range. Three top-end detectors, placed at 14.3 dB taps on a passive attenuator, handle the upper third of the 90 dB range. Biasing for these cells is provided by two references: one determines their gain and the other is a band gap circuit that determines the logarithmic slope \nand stabilizes it against supply and temperature variations. The \nAD8307 can be enabled or disabled by a CMOS-compatible level at ENB (Pin 6). The first amplifier stage provides a low voltage noise spectral density (1.5 nV/√Hz). \nThe differential current-mode outputs of the nine detectors are \nsummed and then converted to single-sided form in the output stage, nominally scaled 2 μA/dB. The logarithmic output voltage is developed by applying this current to an on-chip 12.5 kΩ \nresistor, resulting in a logarithmic slope of 25 mV/dB (that is, \n500 mV/decade) at the OUT pin. This voltage is not buffered, allowing the use of a variety of special output interfaces, including the addition of postdemodulation filtering. The last detector stage includes a modification to temperature stabilize the \nlog intercept, which is accurately positioned to make optimal \nuse of the full output voltage range available. The intercept can be adjusted using the INT pin, which adds or subtracts a small current to the signal current. \n01082-027BAND GAP REFERENCE\nAND BIASING\nSIX 14.3dB 900MHz\nAMPLIFIER STAGES\nMIRROR\nINPUT-OFFSET\nCOMPENSATION LOOPCOMINMINPENB VPS\nINT\nOUT\nOFSAD8307\n7.5mA\n1.1kΩ\n3\n22µA\n/dB\n12.5kΩ\nCOMNINE DETECTOR CELLS\nSPACED 14.3dB–INP+INP\n8\n1\n27\n56\n4\n3\n \nFigure 27. Main Features of the AD8307 \nThe last gain stage also includes an offset sensing cell. This \ngenerates a bipolarity output current when the main signal path \nhas an imbalance due to accumulated dc offsets. This current is \nintegrated by an on-chip capacitor, which can be increased in value by an off-chip component at OFS. The resulting voltage is used to null the offset at the output of the first stage. Because it does not involve the signal input connections, whose ac-coupling \ncapacitors otherwise introduce a second pole in the feedback \npath, the stability of the offset correction loop is assured. \nThe AD8307 is built on an advanced, dielectrically isolated, \ncomplementary bipolar process. Most resistors are thin film \ntypes having a low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and high linearity under large signal conditions. Their absolute tolerance is typically within ±20%. Similarly, the capacitors have a typical tolerance of ±15% and essentially zero temperature or voltage sensitivity. Most interfaces have additional small junction capacitances associated with them due to active devices or ESD \nprotection; these can be neither accurate nor stable. Component \nnumbering in each of these interface diagrams is local. \nENABLE INTERFACE \nThe chip enable interface is shown in Figure 28. The currents in the diode-connected transistors control the turn-on and turn-off states of the band gap reference and the bias generator, and are a maximum of 100 μA when Pin 6 is taken to 5 V , under worst-case conditions. Left unconnected, or at a voltage below 1 V , the AD8307 is disabled and consumes a sleep current of \nunder 50 μA; tied to the supply, or at a voltage above 2 V , it is fully enabled. The internal bias circuitry is very fast, typically <100 ns for either off or on. In practice, the latency period before the log amp exhibits its full dynamic range is more likely to be limited by factors relating to the use of ac coupling at the \ninput or the settling of the offset control loop. \nCOMENB40kΩ\nTO BIAS\nSTAGESAD8307\n6\n2\n01082-028\n \nFigure 28.

Signal Input Interface \nINPUT INTERFACE \nFigure 29 shows the essentials of the signal input interface. C P \nand C M are the parasitic capacitances to ground; C D is the \ndifferential input capacitance, mostly due to Q1 and Q2. In \nmost applications, both input pins are ac-coupled. The switches close when ENB is asserted. When disabled, the inputs float, bias current I\nE is shut off, and the coupling capacitors remain \ncharged. If the log amp is disabled for long periods, small leakage currents discharge these capacitors. If they are poorly matched, charging currents at power-up can generate a transient input \nData Sheet AD8307\n \nRev. F | Page 15 of 24 voltage that can block the lower reaches of the dynamic range \nuntil it has become much less than the signal.  \nIn most applications, the signal is single sided and can be applied \nto either Pin 1 or Pin 8, with the other pin ac-coupled to ground. Under these conditions, the largest input signal that can be handled by the AD8307 is 10 dBm (sine amplitude of ±1 V) \nwhen operating from a 3 V supply; 16 dBm can be handled using a 5 V supply. The full 16 dBm can be achieved for supplies down to 2.7 V , using a fully balanced drive. For frequencies above about 10 MHz, this is most easily achieved using a matching network. Using such a network, having an inductor at the input, \nthe input transient is eliminated. Occasionally, it is desirable to use \nthe dc-coupled potential of the AD8307. The main challenge is to \npresent signals to the log amp at the elevated common-mode input level, requiring the use of low noise, low offset buffer amplifiers. Using dual supplies of ±3 V , the input pins can operate at ground potential. \nOFFSET INTERFACE \nThe input-referred dc offsets in the signal path are nulled via the interface associated with Pin 3, shown in Figure 30. Q1 and \nQ2 are the first stage input transistors, with their corresponding \nload resistors (125 Ω). Q3 and Q4 generate small currents, which can introduce a dc offset into the signal path. When the voltage on OFS is at about 1.5 V , these currents are equal and nominally 64 μA. When OFS is taken to ground, Q4 is off and the effect of the \ncurrent in Q3 is to generate an offset voltage of 64 μV × 125 Ω = \n8 mV . Because the first stage gain is ×5, this is equivalent to an input offset (INP to INM) of 1.6 mV . When OFS is taken to its most positive value, the input-referred offset is reversed to −1.6 mV . If true dc coupling is needed, down to very small inputs, this auto-\nmatic loop must be disabled and the residual offset eliminated \nusing a manual adjustment. \nIn normal operation, however, using an ac-coupled input signal, \nthe OFS pin should be left open. Any residual input offset voltage is then automatically nulled by the action of the feedback loop. The g\nm cell, which is gated off when the chip is disabled, converts \nany output offset (sensed at a point near the end of the cascade \nof amplifiers) to a current. This is integrated by the on-chip \ncapacitor, C HP, and any added external capacitance, C OFS, to \ngenerate an error voltage, which is applied back to the input stage in the polarity needed to null the output offset. From a small signal perspective, this feedback alters the response of the \namplifier, which, rather than behaving as a fully dc-coupled \nsystem, now exhibits a zero in its ac transfer function, resulting in a closed-loop high-pass corner at about 1.5 MHz. \n 48kΩ125Ω 125Ω\nMAIN GAIN\nSTAGES\nQ2Q1\nQ364µA AT\nBALANCE\nQ4S\nAVERAGE\nERRORCURRENTOFSTO LASTDETECTOR\nC\nOFS CHP\nCOMVPS\n36kΩINPUT\nSTAGE\n01082-030BIAS, ~1.2V\n237\ngm\n \nFigure 30. Offset Interfac e and Offset Nulling Path \nThe offset feedback is limited to a range of ±1.6 mV; signals larger \nthan this override the offset control loop, which only affects perfor-mance for very small inputs. An external capacitor reduces the high-pass corner to arbitrarily low frequencies; using 1 μF, this \ncorner is below 10 Hz. All Analog Devices log amps use an offset \nnulling loop; the AD8307 differs in using this single-sided form.  \nOUTPUT INTERFACE \nThe outputs from the nine detectors are differential currents, having an average value that is dependent on the signal input level, plus a fluctuation at twice the input frequency. The currents are summed at the LGP node and the LGM node in Figure 31. Further currents are added at these nodes, to position the intercept, \nby slightly raising the output for zero input, and to provide \ntemperature compensation. Because the AD8307  is not laser \ntrimmed, there is a small uncertainty in both the log slope and the log intercept. These scaling parameters can be adjusted. \nFor zero signal conditions, all the detector output currents are \nequal. For a finite input of either polarity, their difference is converted by the output interface to a single-sided unipolar \ncurrent nominally scaled 2 μA/dB (40 μA/decade) at the OUT pin. \nAn on-chip 12.5 kΩ resistor, R1, converts this current to a voltage of 25 mV/dB. C1 and C2 are effectively in shunt with R1 and form a low-pass filter pole with a corner frequency of about 5 MHz. The pulse response settles to within 1% of the final value within \n300 ns. This integral low-pass filter provides adequate smoothing \nin many IF applications. At 10.7 MHz, the 2f ripple is 12.5 mV in amplitude, equivalent to ±0.5 dB, and only 0.5 mV (±0.02 dB) at f = 50 MHz. A filter capacitor, C\nFLT, added from the OUT pin to \nground lowers this corner frequency. Using 1 μF, the ripple is \nmaintained to less than ±0.5 dB down to input frequencies of \n100 Hz. Note that C OFS should also be increased in low frequency \napplications, and is typically made equal to C FLT. \n \n \n \n    \nAD8307 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 16 of 24 It can be desirable to increase the speed of the output response, \nwith the penalty of increased ripple. One way to do this is by connecting a shunt load resistor from the OUT pin to ground, which raises the low-pass corner frequency. This also alters the \nlogarithmic slope, for example, to 7.5 mV/dB using a 5.36 kΩ \nresistor, while reducing the 10% to 90% rise time to 25 ns. The ripple amplitude for the 50 MHz input remains at 0.5 mV , but this is now equivalent to ±0.07 dB. If a negative supply is available, the output pin can be connected directly to the summing node \nof an external op amp connected as an inverting mode transresis-\ntance stage. \nNote that while the AD8307 can operate down to supply voltages \nof 2.7 V , the output voltage limit is reduced when the supply \ndrops below 4 V . This characteristic is the result of necessary headroom requirements, approximately two V\nBE drops, in the \ndesign of the output stage.  1.25kΩ\n25mV/dB\nOUT2µA/dB\n0µA TO 220µAINTFROM ALL\nDETECTORS\nCFLTC2\n1pFVPS\nBIAS1.25kΩ 1.25kΩ\n~400mV8.25kΩ\n60kΩ\n60µA\nCOMR1\n12.5kΩC12.5pF3pF\nLGP\nLGM\n1.25kΩ\n01082-03147\n5\n2 \nFigure 31. Simplified  Output Interface \n \nData Sheet AD8307\n \nRev. F | Page 17 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8307 has very high gain and a bandwidth from dc to over \n1 GHz, at which frequency the gain of the main path is still over \n60 dB. Consequently, it is susceptible to all signals within this very broad frequency range that find their way to the input terminals. It \nis important to remember that these are indistinguishable from \nthe wanted signal, and has the effect of raising the apparent noise floor (that is, lowering the useful dynamic range). For example, while the signal of interest can be an IF of 50 MHz, any of the following could easily be larger than the IF signal at \nthe lower extremities of its dynamic range: 60 Hz hum (picked \nup due to poor grounding techniques), spurious coupling (from a digital clock source on the same PC board), and local radio stations, for example. \nCareful shielding is essential. A ground plane should be used to \nprovide a low impedance connection to the common pin, COM, for the decoupling capacitors used at VPS, and as the output ground. It is inadvisable to assume that the ground plane is \nequipotential. Neither of the inputs should be ac-coupled directly \nto the ground plane, but should be kept separate from it, being returned instead to the low associated with the source. This can mean isolating the low side of an input connector with a small resistance to the ground plane. \nBASIC CONNECTIONS \nFigure 32 shows the simple connections suitable for many applications. The inputs are ac coupled by C1 and C2, which \nshould have the same value, for example, C\nC. The coupling time \nconstant is R IN CC/2, thus forming a high-pass corner with a \n3 dB attenuation at f HP = 1/(pR INCC ). In high frequency applica-\ntions, f HP should be as large as possible to minimize the coupling \nof unwanted low frequency signals. Conversely, in low frequency applications, a simple RC network forming a low-pass filter \nshould be added at the input for the same reason. For the case where the generator is not terminated, the signal range should be expressed in terms of the voltage response and should extend from −85 dBV to +6 dBV . \nC2 = C CC1 = C C\nOUTPUT\n25mV/dB\n01082-032AD8307RTINPUT\n–75dBm TO\n+16dBmNC\nINP VPS ENB INT\nINM COM OFS OUT\nNC\nNC = NO CONNECT8765\n234 11.1kΩ4.7Ω0.1µF\nRIN≈VP, 2.7V TO 5.5 V\nAT ~8mA\n \nFigure 32. Basic Connections \n \n  Where it is necessary to terminate the source at a low impedance, \nthe resistor R\nT should be added, with allowance for the shunting \neffect of the basic 1.1 kΩ input resistance (R IN) of the AD8307. \nFor example, to terminate a 50 Ω source, a 52.3 Ω 1% tolerance \nresistor should be used. This can be placed on the input side or \nthe log amp side of the coupling capacitors; in the former case, smaller capacitors can be used for a given frequency range; in the latter case, the effective R\nIN is lowered directly at the log \namp inputs.  \nFigure 33 shows the output vs. the input level, in dBm, when \ndriven from a terminated 50 Ω generator, for sine inputs at \n10 MHz, 100 MHz, and 500 MHz; Figure 34 shows the typical \nlogarithmic conformance under the same conditions. Note that 10 dBm corresponds to a sine amplitude of 1 V , equivalent to an rms power of 10 mW in a 50 Ω termination. However, if the termination resistor is omitted, the input power is negligible. The use of dBm to define input level therefore needs to be \nconsidered carefully in connection with the AD8307. \n3.0\n2.5\n02.01.5\n1.0\n0.5\n500MHz100MHz10MHz\n01082-033\n–80 –70 –60 –50 –40 –30 –20 –10 0 10 20OUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)\nINPUT LEVEL (dBm) \nFigure 33.

F | Page 18 of 24 INPUT MATCHING \nWhere higher sensitivity is required, an input matching network \nis valuable. Using a transformer to achieve the impedance transformation also eliminates the need for coupling capacitors, which lowers the offset voltage generated directly at the input, \nand balances the drives to the INP pin and the INM pin. The \nchoice of turns ratio depends somewhat on the frequency. At frequencies below 50 MHz, the reactance of the input capacitance is much higher than the real part of the input impedance. In this frequency range, a turns ratio of about 1:4.8 lowers the input impedance to 50 Ω while raising the input voltage, thus lowering \nthe effect of the short-circuit noise voltage by the same factor. \nThere is a small contribution from the input noise current, so the total noise is reduced by a lesser factor. The intercept is also lowered by the turns ratio; for a 50 Ω match, it is reduced by 20 log\n10 (4.8) or 13.6 dB. \nNARROW-BAND MATCHING \nTransformer coupling is useful in broadband applications. How-ever, a magnetically coupled transformer may not be convenient in \nsome situations. At high frequencies, it is often preferable to use \na narrow-band matching network, as shown in Figure 35.  \nUsing a narrow-band matching network has several advantages. \nThe same voltage gain is achieved, providing increased sensitivity, but a measure of selectivity is also introduced. The component count is low: two capacitors and an inexpensive chip inductor. Further, by making these capacitors unequal, the amplitudes at \nthe INP pin and the INM pin can be equalized when driving from \na single-sided source, that is, the network also serves as a balun.  \nFigure 36 shows the response for a center frequency of 100 MHz. \nNote the very high attenuation at low frequencies. The high fre-quency attenuation is due to the input capacitance of the log amp.

F | Page 19 of 24 SLOPE AND INTERCEPT ADJUSTMENTS \nWhere higher calibration accuracy is needed, the adjustments \nshown in Figure 37 can be used, either singly or in combination. The log slope is lowered to 20 mV/dB by shunting the nominally 12.5 kΩ on-chip load resistor (see Figure 31) with 50 kΩ, adjusted \nby VR1. The calibration range is ±10% (18 mV/dB to 22 mV/dB), \nincluding full allowance for the variability in the value of the internal load. The adjustment can be made by alternately applying two input levels, provided by an accurate signal generator, spaced over the central portion of the log amp’s dynamic range, for example, −60 dBm and 0 dBm. An AM modulated signal at the \ncenter of the dynamic range can also be used. For a modulation \ndepth, M, expressed as a fraction, the decibel range between the peaks and troughs over one cycle of the modulation period is given by \nMMdB\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d \uf04411log 2010  (7) \nFor example, using an rms signal level of −40 dBm with a 70% modulation depth (M = 0.7), the decibel range is 15 dB, as the signal varies from −47.5 dBm to −32.5 dBm.  The log intercept is adjustable over a ±3 dB range, which is sufficient to absorb the worst-case intercept error in the AD8307, \nplus some system level errors. For greater range, set R\nS to zero. \nVR2 is adjusted while applying an accurately known CW signal \nnear the lower end of the dynamic range to minimize the effect \nof any residual uncertainty in the slope. For example, to position the intercept to −80 dBm, a test level of −65 dBm can be applied and VR2 adjusted to produce a dc output of 15 dB above zero at 25 mV/dB, which is 0.3 V . \n01082-037C2 = CCC1 = CC\n20mV/dB\n±10%AD8307INPUT\n–75dBm TO\n+16dBmINP VPS ENB INT\nINM COM OFS OUT\nNC\nNC = NO CONNECT8765\n234 14.7Ω\nVR2\n50kΩ RS0.1µF\nVP, 2.7V TO 5.5V\nAT ~8mA\n±3dB\nVR1\n50kΩ32.4kΩFOR VP = 3V, RS = 20kΩ\nVP = 5V, RS = 51kΩ\n \nFigure 37. Slope and Intercept Adjustments \n \n \nAD8307 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 20 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe AD8307 is a highly versatile and easily applied log amp \nrequiring very few external components. Most applications of this \ndevice can be accommodated using the simple connections shown in the preceding section.  \nBUFFERED OUTPUT \nThe output can be buffered and the slope optionally increased by using an op amp. If the single-supply capability is to be preserved, a \nsuitable component is the AD8031 . Like the AD8307, it is capable \nof operating from a 2.7 V supply and features a rail-to-rail \noutput capability; it is available in a 5-lead version and in dual form as the 8-lead AD8032 . Figure 38 shows how the slope can \nbe increased to 50 mV/dB (1 V per decade), requiring a 5 V supply (90 dB times 50 mV is a 4.5 V swing). VR1 provides a \n±10% slope adjustment; VR2 provides a ±3 dB intercept range. \nWith R2 = 4.99 kΩ, the slope is adjustable to 25 mV/dB, allowing the use of a 2.7 V supply. Setting R2 to 80.6 kΩ, it is raised to 100 mV/dB, providing direct read ing in decibels on a digital \nvoltmeter. Because a 90 dB range now corresponds to a 9 V swing, \na supply of at least this amount is needed for the op amp. \n20mV/dBAD8031\n01082-038OUTPUT\n50mV/dB±10% AD8307INPUT\n–75dBm TO\n+16dBmINP VPS ENB INT\nINM COM OFS OUT\nNC\nNC = NO CONNECT8765\n234 14.7Ω\nVR2\n50kΩ\nR230.1kΩ\nCOMR120kΩR\nS0.1µF\nVP, 2.7V TO 5.5V\n±3dB\nVR1\n50kΩ32.4kΩ C1FOR V P = 3V, R S = 20kΩ\nVP = 5V, R S = 51kΩ\n \nFigure 38. Log Amp with Buffered Output \nC1 is optional; it lowers the corner frequency of the low-pass \noutput filter. A value of 0.1 μF should be used for applications in \nwhich the output is measured on a voltmeter or other low speed \ndevice. On the other hand, when C1 is omitted, the 10% to 90% response time is under 200 ns and is typically 300 ns to 99% of the final value. To achieve faster response times, it is necessary to lower the load resistance at the output of the AD8307, then \nrestore the scale using a higher gain in the op amp. Using 8.33 kΩ, \nthe basic slope is 10 mV/dB; this can be restored to 25 mV/dB \nusing a buffer gain of 2.5. The overall 10% to 90% response time is under 100 ns. Figure 39 shows how the output current capability can be augmented to drive a 50 Ω load; R\nT optionally provides \nreverse termination, which halves the slope to 12.5 mV/dB. \nFOUR-POLE FILTER \nIn low frequency applications, for example, audio down to 20 Hz, it is useful to employ the buffer amplifier as a multipole \nlow-pass filter to achieve low output ripple while maintaining a \nrapid response time to changes in signal level. 25mV/dB2N3904\n10mV/dB\n±18%AD8031\n01082-039OUTPUT\n50ΩMINIMUMAD8307INPUT\n–75dBm TO\n+16dBmINP VPS ENB INT\nINM COM OFS OUT\nNC\nNC = NO CONNECT8765\n234 14.7Ω\nVR2\n50kΩ\nR23.01kΩ\nR1\n2kΩR\nS0.1µF\nVP, 2.7V TO 5.5V\n±3dB\nVR1\n5kΩ6.34kΩRT\n(OPTIONAL)\nCOM \nFigure 39.

The residual ripple is 4 mV (±0.02 dB) \nwhen the input to the AD8307 is at 20 Hz. This filter can easily \nbe adapted to other frequencies by proportional scaling of C5 to C7 \n(for example, for 100 kHz use 100 pF). Placed ahead of a digital multimeter, the convenient slope scaling of 100 mV/dB requires only a repositioning of the decimal point to read directly in \ndecibels. The supply voltage for the filter must be large enough to \nsupport the dynamic range; a minimum of 9 V is needed for most applications; 12 V is recommended.  \nVR2\n50kΩ\nSLOPE\n01082-040OUTPUT100mV/dB\nAD8307INPUT 5m V\nTO 160V rms\nINP VPS ENB INT\nINM COM OFS OUT8765\n234 14.7Ω\nVR1\n2kΩ\nNCR1\n50kΩ\n93kΩ\n80.6kΩ 32.4kΩ34kΩ422Ω0.1µF\nVP\nC6\n1µF75kΩC7\n1µF\nC2\n10µFC3\n2.5nF\n++C1\n10µFOP AMP IS AD8032 SCALE\nC1 TO C8 AS NEEDED.\nNOTE POLARITIES IF TANTALUM\nCAPACITORS ARE USED.C4\n1µF+\n+++C8\n1µF7.32kΩ\n100kΩ\n34kΩ+C5\n1µFINT ±4dB\nCOM  \nFigure 40.

Because the basic input resistance of the AD8307 is not precise, VR1 is used to center the \nsignal range at its input, doubling as a ±4 dB intercept adjustment. The low frequency response extends to 15 Hz; a higher corner \nfrequency can be selected as needed by scaling C1 and C2. The \nshunt capacitor, C3, is used to lower the high frequency bandwidth to about 100 kHz, and thus lower the susceptibility to spurious signals. Other values should be chosen as needed for the coupling and filter capacitors.  \nData Sheet AD8307\n \nRev. F | Page 21 of 24 1 μW TO 1 kW 50 Ω POWER METER \nThe front-end adaptation shown in Figure 41 provides the \nmeasurement of power being delivered from a transmitter final amplifier to an antenna. The range has been set to cover the power range −30 dBm (7.07 mV rms, or 1 μW) to +60 dBm \n(223 V rms, or 1 kW). A nominal voltage attenuation ratio of \n158:1 (44 dB) is used; thus the intercept is moved from −84 dBm to −40 dBm and the AD8307, scaled 0.25 V/decade of power, now \nreads 1.5 V for a power level of 100 mW , 2.0 V at 10 W , and 2.5 V at 1 kW . The general expression is \nP (dBm)  = 40 ( V\nOUT − 1) \nThe required attenuation can be implemented using a capacitive divider, providing a very low input capacitance, but it is difficult to \nensure accurate values of small capacitors. A better approach is \nto use a resistive divider, taking the required precautions to minim-ize spurious coupling into the AD8307 by placing it in a shielded \nbox with the input resistor passing through a hole in this box, as indicated in Figure 41. The coupling capacitors shown in Figure 41 \nare suitable for f ≥ 10 MHz. A capacitor can be added across the \ninput pins of the AD8307 to reduce the response to spurious HF signals, which, as previously noted, extends to over 1 GHz. \nThe mismatch caused by the loading of this resistor is trivial; \nonly 0.05% of the power delivered to the load is absorbed by the measurement system, a maximum of 500 mW at 1 kW . The postdemodulation filtering and slope calibration arrangements \nare chosen from other applications described in this data sheet \nto meet the particular system requirements. The 1 nF capacitor lowers the risk of HF signals entering the AD8307 via the load. \nTO\nANTENN A\nVP\n604Ω100kΩ\n1/2W\nNC\n2kΩVR1\n2kΩ\nINT ±3dB51pF\n51pF0.1µF\nNC\nOUTPUTLEAD-\nTHROUGH\nCAPACITORS,\n1nF\n1nF\nNC = NO CONNECT+5V\nVOUT\n01082-041AD8307INP VPS ENB INT\nINM COM OFS OUT8765\n234 150Ω INPUT\nFROM P.A.\n1µW TO\n1kW22Ω\n \nFigure 41. 1 μW to 1 kW, 50 Ω Power Meter \nMEASUREMENT SYSTEM WITH 120 dB DYNAMIC \nRANGE \nThe dynamic range of the AD8307 can be extended further from \n90 dB to over 120 dB by the addition of an X-AMP® such as the \nAD603. This type of variable gain amplifier exhibits a very exact exponential gain control characteristic, which is another way of stating that the gain varies by a constant number of decibels for \na given change in the control voltage. For the AD603, this scaling \nfactor is 40 dB/V , or 25 mV/dB. It is apparent that this property \nof a linear-in-dB response is characteristic of log amps; indeed, the AD8307 exhibits the same scaling factor. The AD603 has a very low input-referred noise: 1.3 nV/√Hz at its \n100 Ω input, or 0.9 nV/√Hz when matched to 50 Ω, equivalent to 0.4 μV rms, or −115 dBm, in a 200 kHz bandwidth. It is also capable of handling inputs in excess of 1.4 V rms, or +16 dBm. It is \nthus able to cope with a dynamic range of over 130 dB in this \nparticular bandwidth. \nIf the gain control voltage for the X-AMP is derived from the \noutput of the AD8307, the effect is to raise the gain of this front-end stage when the signal is small and lower it when it is large, but without altering the fundamental logarithmic nature of the response. This gain range is 40 dB, which, combined with the 90 dB \nrange of the AD8307, again corresponds to a 130 dB range. \nVPOS\nGNEG\nAD603\nFDBKGPOS\nVNEG\nCOMMVINPVOUT0.65V\n0.15V TO 1.15V OUTPUT\n10mV/dBNC\nR6\n20kΩR7\n80.6kΩ0.1µFBANDPASS\nFILTER*\nVR1\n5kΩINT±8dB\n1nFNC\n0.3VTO\n2.3VC1\n150pFL1\n750nHR3\n330Ω\nR4\n464Ω\nR5\n100kΩ*FOR EXAMPLE: MURATA SFE10.7MS2G-A\nNC = NO CONNECT50Ω\nINPUT\n–105dBmTO+15dBm\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5R2\n28kΩR1\n187kΩ 4.7Ω\nAD8307INP VPS ENB INT\nINM COM OFS OUT8765\n234 1\nVN, –5VVP, +5V\n01082-042\n \nFigure 42. 120 dB Measurement System \nFigure 42 shows how these two parts can work together to \nprovide state-of-the-art IF measurements in applications such as spectrum/network analyzers and other high dynamic range instrumentation. To understand the operation, note first that the AD8307 is used to generate an output of about 0.3 V to \n2.3 V . This 2 V span is divided by 2 in R5, R6, and R7 to provide the 1 V span needed by the AD603 to vary its gain by 40 dB. \nNote that an increase in the positive voltage applied at GNEG (Pin 2 of the AD603) lowers the gain. This feedback network is \ntapped to provide a convenient 10 mV/dB scaling at the output node, which can be buffered if necessary. \nThe center of the voltage range fed back to the AD603 is 650 mV , \nand the ±20 dB gain range is centered by R1/R2. Note that the \nintercept calibration of this system benefits from the use of a well-regulated 5 V supply. To absorb the insertion loss of the filter and center the full dynamic range, the intercept is adjusted by varying the maximum gain of the AD603, using VR1. Figure 43 \nshows the AD8307  output over the range −120 dBm to +20 dBm \nand the deviation from an ideal logarithmic response. The dotted line shows the increase in the noise floor that results when the filter is omitted; the decibel difference is about 10 log\n10(50/0.2) \nor 24 dB, assuming a 50 MHz bandwidth from the AD603. An \nLC filter can be used in place of the ceramic filter used in this \nexample. \nAD8307 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Results for 120 dB Measurement System \nOPERATION AT LOW FREQUENCIES \nThe AD8307 provides excellent logarithmic conformance at \nsignal frequencies that can be arbitrarily low, depending only on \nthe values used for the input coupling capacitors. It can also be desirable to add a low-pass input filter to desensitize the log amp to HF signals. Figure 44 shows a simple arrangement, provid-ing coupling with an attenuation of 20 dB; the intercept is shifted up by this attenuation, from −84 dBm to −64 dBm, and the \ninput range is now 0.5 mV to 20 V (sine amplitude). \nA high-pass 3 dB corner frequency of nominally 3 Hz is set by \nthe 10 μF coupling capacitors, C1 and C2, which are preferably tantalum electrolytics (note the polarity) and a low-pass 3 dB corner frequency of 200 kHz (set by C3 and the effective resis-tance at the input of 1 kΩ). The −1% amplitude error points occur at 20 Hz and 30 kHz. These are readily altered to suit other applications by simple scaling. When C3 is zero, the low-pass \ncorner is at 200 MHz. Note that the lower end of the dynamic \nrange is improved by this capacitor, which essentially provides an HF short circuit at the input. This significantly lowers the wideband noise; the noise reduction is about 2 dB compared to when the AD8307  is driven from a 50 Ω source. Ensure that the \noutput is free of postdemodulation ripple by lowering the low-pass filter time constant, which is provided by C5. With the value shown in Figure 44, the output time constant is 125 ms.  \nSee Figure 40 for a more elaborate filter.
