The amplifier offers low \nnoise of 2.1 nV/√Hz and excellent distortion performance over \na wide frequency range , making it an ideal driver for high speed \n8-bit to 16 -bit analog -to-digital converters (ADCs).  \nThe ADL5561 provides three gain levels of 6  dB, 12 dB, and 15.5 dB \nthrough a pin -strappable configuration. For the single -ended  \ninput configuration , the gains are  reduced to 5.6  dB, 11.1  dB, and \n14.1 dB. Using an external series input resistor expands the \namplifier  gain flexibility and allows for any gain selection from \n0 dB to 15.5 dB. \nThe quiescent current of the ADL5561 is typically 40  mA and , \nwhen disabled , consumes less than 3  mA, offering excellent \ninput -to-output isolation.  The de vice is optimized for wideband, low distortion performance.  \nThese attributes, together with its adjustable gain capability, make this device the amplifier of choice for general -purpose IF \nand broadband applications where low distortion, noise, and power  \nare critical. This device is optimized for the be st combination of \nslew speed, bandwidth , and broadband distortion. These attributes  \nallow it to drive a wide variety of ADCs and make it ideally suited  \nfor driving mixers, pin diode attenuators, SAW filters, a nd multi -\nelement discrete devices.  \nFabricated on the  Analog Devices, Inc., high speed SiGe process, \nthe ADL5561 is supplied in a compact 3  mm × 3  mm, 16 -lead \nLFCSP package  and operates over the temperature range of \n−40°C to +85°C.  \n \n \n \nADL5561  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

G | Page 13 of 24 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nBASIC STRUCTURE  \nThe ADL5561  is a low noise, low power, fully differential amplifier/ \nADC driver that uses a 3.3 V supply. It provides three gain options \n(6 dB, 12 dB, and 15.5 dB) without the need for external resistors and has wide bandwidths of 2.6 GHz for 6 dB, 2.3 GHz for 12 \ndB, and 2.1 GHz for 15.5 dB. Differential input impedance is \n400 Ω for 6 dB, 200 Ω for 12 dB, and 133 Ω for 15.5 dB. It has a differential output impedance of 10 Ω and an output common-\nmode adjust voltage of 1.25 V to 1.85 V . \nRL1/2 RS\n1/2 RSAC200Ω400Ω0.1µF\n0.1µF400Ω200Ω\n100Ω100Ω VIP2\nVIP1\nVIN1\nVIN25Ω\n5Ω\n+ +\n08004- 032\n \nFigure 32. Basic Structure \nThe ADL5561  is composed of a fully differential amplifier with \non-chip feedback and feed-forward resistors. The two feed-\nforward resistors on each input set this pin-strappable amplifier \nin three different gain configurations of 6 dB, 12 dB, and 15.5 dB.  The amplifier is designed to provide high differential open-loop \ngain and an output common-mode circuit that enables the user to change the common-mode voltage from a VCOM pin. The amplifier is designed to provide superior low distortion at \nfrequencies up to and beyond 300 MHz with low noise and  \nlow power consumption. The low distortion and noise are \nrealized with a 3.3 V power supply at 40 mA. \nThe ADL5561  is very flexible in terms of I/O coupling. It can be \nac-coupled or dc-coupled at the inputs and/or the outputs within \nthe specified input and output common-mode levels. The input of the device can be configured as single-ended or differential with \nsimilar distortion performance. Due to the internal connections \nbetween the inputs and outputs, keep the output common-mode \nvoltage between 1.25 V and 1.85 V for the best distortion.  \nFor a dc-coupled input, the input common mode should be \nbetween 1 V and 2.3 V for the best distortion. The device has been characterized using 2 V p-p into 200 Ω. If the inputs are  ac-coupled, the input and output common-mode voltages are \nset by VCC/2 when no external circuitry is used. The ADL5561  \nprovides an output common-mode voltage set by VCOM, which \nallows driving an ADC directly without external components, such as a transformer or ac-coupling capacitors, provided that the VCOM of the amplifier is within the VCOM of the ADC. For dc-coupled requirements, the input VCM must be set by the VCOM pin in all three gain settings. \n \nADL5561 Data Sheet\n \nRev. G | Page 14 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nBASIC CONNECTIONS  \nFigure 33 shows the basic connections for operating the ADL5561 . \nVCC should be 3.3 V with each supply pin decoupled with at least \none low inductance surface-mount ceramic capacitor of 0.1 μF placed as close as possible to the device. The VCOM pin (Pin 9) should also be decoupled using a 0.1 μF capacitor.  \nThe gain of the part is determined by the pin-strappable input \nconfiguration. When Input A is applied to VIP1 and Input B is \napplied to VIN1, the gain is 6 dB (minimum gain; see Equation 1 and Equation 2). When Input A is applied to VIP2 and Input B is applied to VIN2, the gain is 12 dB (middle gain). When Input A is applied to VIP1 and VIP2 and Input B is applied to VIN1 and \nVIN2, the gain is 15.5 dB (maximum gain).  Pin 1 to Pin 4, Pin 10, and Pin 11 are biased at 1/2 VCC above \nground and can be dc-coupled (if within the specified input and output common-mode voltages levels) or ac-coupled, as shown \nin Figure 33.  \nTo enable the ADL5561 , the ENBL pin must be pulled high. \nPulling the ENBL pin low puts the ADL5561  in sleep mode, \nreducing the current consumption to 3 mA at ambient. \n \n  \n1\n2341112\n10\n9\n5 6 7 815 16 14 13\nVIP2\nVIP1\nVIN1VIN2VOPENBL\nVON\nVCOM\nVCCVCCVCC\nVCCAC\nVCCGND GND GND GND\nADL5561VCC\nBALANCED\nLOADRL\n0.1µF0.1µFA\nB 0.1µF\n10µF0.1µFRS/2\nRS/2BALANCED\nSOURCE\n08004- 033\n \nFigure 33.

The differential \nbroadband input is provided by the ETC1-1-13 balun transformer, and the two 34.8 Ω resistors provide a 50 Ω input match for  \nthe three input impedances that change with the variable gain \nstrapping. The input and output 0.1 μF capacitors isolate the VCC/2 bias from the source and balanced load. The load must be 200 Ω to provide the expected ac performance (see the Specifications section and the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section).  \n3.3V\nVIP2\nVIP1\nVIN1\nVIN2A\nB50Ω\nACR2\n08004- 036\n+ +\n0.1µFETC1-1-130.1µF\n+\nR1+0.1µF\n0.1µF\nNOTES\n1.

The \nstrappable gain values are listed in Table 6 with the required terminations to match to a 50 Ω source using R1 and R2. Note that R1 must equal the parallel value of the source and R2. The input and output 0.1 μF capacitors isolate the VCC/2 bias from \nthe source and the balanced load.

A matched attenuator network can reduce the \neffective gain, but this requires the addition of a separate \ncomponent that can be  prohibitive in size and cost. Instead, a \nsimple voltage divider can be implemented using the combination  \nof an addition series resistor at the amplifier input and the input \nimpedance of the ADL5561, as shown in Figure 38. A shunt \nresistor is used to match to the im pedanc e of the previous stage.  \n0.1µF\n08004-0391/2 RSHUNT1/2 RS\n1/2 RSAC0.1µF 1/2RSERIES\nVIP1VIN2VIN1\nVIP21/2RSERIES1/2 RSHUNT\nADL5561\n \nFigure 38. Gain Adjustment Using Series Resistor  \nFigure 38 shows a typical implementation of the divider concept \nthat effectively reduces the gain by adding attenuation at the input. For frequencies less than 100 MHz, the input  impedance \nof the ADL5561 can be modeled as a real 133 Ω, 200 Ω, or 400 Ω \nresistance (differential) for max imum , mid dle, and min imum  \ngains, respectively. Assuming that the frequency is low enough \nto ignore the shunt reactance of the input and high enough s o \nthat the reactance of m oderately sized ac -coupling capacitors \ncan be considered negligible, the insertion loss, Il , due to the \nshunt divider can be expressed as  \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n+=\nIN SERIESIN\nR RRdBIl log20)(  (3) The necessary shunt component, R SHUNT , to match to the source \nimpedance, R S, can be expre ssed as  \nIN SERIES SSHUNT\nR R RR\n+−=1 11 (4) \nThe insertion loss and the resultant power gain for multiple shunt \nresistor values are  summarized in Table 8. The source resistance \nand input impedance need carefu l attention when using Equati on 3 \nand Equation 4. The reactance of the input impedance of the \nADL5561 and the ac -coupling capacitors must  be considered \nbefore assuming they make a negligible contribution .  \nTable 8.

There are several options available to the designer when using the ADL5561. Figure 39 shows a simplified \nwideband interface with the ADL5561 driving the AD9445. The \nAD9445 is a 14 -bit, 125 MSPS ADC  with a buffered  wideband input .  \nFor optimum performance, the ADL5561 should be driven di f-\nferentially using an input balun.  Figure 39 uses a wideband 1:1 \ntransmissi on line balun followed by two 34.8 Ω resis tors in parallel \nwith the three input impedance s (which change with the gain \nselection of the ADL5561 ) to provide a 50 Ω  differential  inpu t \nimpedance.  This provides a wideband match to a 50 Ω source. \nThe ADL5561 is ac-coupled from the AD9445 to avoid common -\nmode dc loading. The 33 Ω series resistors help to improve the \nisolation between the ADL5561 and any switching curre nts present \nat the analog -to-digital sa mple -and-hold input circuitry.

Measured Frequency Response of the Wideband  \n The wideband frequency response is an advantage in broad-\nband applications, such as predistortion receiver designs and instrumentation applications. However, by designing for a wide analog input frequency range, the cascaded SNR performance  \nis somewhat degraded due to high frequency noise aliasing into \nthe wanted Nyquist zone.  \nAn alternative narrow-band approach is presented in Figure 42. \nBy designing a narrow band-pass antialiasing filter between the ADL5561  and the target ADC, the output noise of the ADL5561  \noutside of the intended Nyquist zone can be attenuated, helping to preserve the available SNR of the ADC. In general, the SNR \nimproves several decibels when including a reasonable order anti-\naliasing filter. In this example, a low loss 1:1 input transformer is used to match the ADL5561  balanced input to a 50 Ω unbalanced \nsource, resulting in minimum insertion loss at the input. \nFigure 42 is optimized for driving some of the Analog Devices \npopular unbuffered ADCs, such as the AD9246, AD9640,  \nand AD6655. Table 9 includes antialiasing filter component \nrecommendations for popular IF sampling center frequencies. Inductor L5 works in parallel with the on-chip ADC input capacitance and a portion of the capacitance presented by C4 to form a resonant tank circuit. The resonant tank helps to ensure that the ADC input looks like a real resistance at the target center frequency. The L5 inductor shorts the ADC inputs at dc, which \nintroduces a zero into the transfer function. In addition, the ac \ncoupling capacitors introduce additional zeros into the transfer function. The final overall frequency response takes on a band-pass characteristic, helping to reject noise outside of the intended Nyquist zone. Table 9 provides initial suggestions for prototyping \npurposes. Some empirical optimization may be needed to help \ncompensate for actual PCB parasitic. \n  \n08004-041105Ω\nL5\n105ΩAD9246\nAD9640AD66551nF L1\nC2L3\n1nF L1 L3C4 CML ADL55614Ω\n4Ω\n \nFigure 42.

If RF transmission  \nlines c onnecting the input or output are used, designed them \nsuch that stray capacitance at the input/output pins is minimized .  In many board designs, the signal trace widths shou ld be \nminimal where the driver/receiver is more than one- eighth of \nthe wavelength from the amplifier.

Solder the paddle to the low impedance \nground pl ane on the PCB to ensure the specified electrical \nperformance and to provide thermal relief. To further reduce thermal impedance, the ground planes on all layers under the paddle should be stitched together with vias.  \nEVALUATION BOARD  \nFigure 45 shows the schematic of the ADL5561 evaluation board.  \nThe board is powered by a single supply in the 3 V to 3.6 V range. \nThe power supply is decoupled by 10  µF and 0.1  µF capacitors   \nTable 14 details the various configuration options of the evaluation  \nboard. Figure 46 and Figure 47 show the component and circuit \nlayouts of the evaluation board.  To realize the minimum gain (6 dB into a 200 Ω load), I nput 1 \n(VIN1 and VIP1) must be used by installing 0 Ω resistors at R3 and R4, leaving R5 and R6 open. R1 and R2 must be 33 Ω for a \n50 Ω input impedance.  \nLikewise, driving I nput 2 (VIN2 and VIP2) realizes the mid dle \ngain (12 dB into a 200 Ω load) by installing 0 Ω at R5 and R6 \nand leaving R3 and R4 open. R1 and R2 must be 29 Ω for a 50 Ω input impedance.  \nFor the maximum gain (15.5 dB into a 200 Ω load), both inputs \nare driven by installing 0 Ω re sistors at R3, R4, R5, and R6. R1 \nand R2 must be 40.2 Ω for a 50 Ω input impedance.   \nThe balanced input and output interfaces are converted to \nsingl e ended with a pair of baluns (M/A -COM ETC1 -1-13).  \nThe balun at the input, T1, provides a 50 Ω single -ended -to-\ndifferential transformation . The output balun, T2, and the \nmatching components are configured to provide a 200 Ω to 50  Ω \nimpedance transformatio n with an insertion loss of about 17 dB.   \nC3\n10µFC40.1µF C50.1µF C60.1µF C70.1µFC8\n0.1µF\nC13\n0.1µF\nC12\n0.1µF\nC110.1µF\nVPOS\n08004-042R9\n34.8ΩR11\nOPENJ3\nJ1\nR10\n34.8ΩR8\n84.5ΩC10\n0.01µFC9\n0.01µFP1\nT1T2\nJ2AGNDVPOSGND\nR7\n84.5ΩENBL\nR1\n40.2Ω\nR2\n40.2ΩR4\n0ΩR3\n0ΩR5\n0Ω\nR6\n0ΩADL5561\n9101112\n432116 15 14 13\n5 6 7 8GND GND GND GND\nVCCVIN1\nVIN2VIP2\nVIP1\nVON\nVOCMENBL\nVOP\nVCC VCC VCCC1\n0.01µF\nC2\n0.01µF\n \nFigure 45.
