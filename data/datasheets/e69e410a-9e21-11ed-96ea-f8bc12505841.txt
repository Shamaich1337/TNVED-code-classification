#### Description:
The VY1472M51Y5VQ63V0 is a ceramic disc capacitor from Vishay's VY1 Series, specifically designed for electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression and safety applications. It is classified as a Class X1 and Y1 capacitor, which means it is suitable for line-to-line and line-to-ground filtering in AC applications. The capacitor features a capacitance value of 4700 pF with a tolerance of ±20%.

#### Typical Applications:
- **EMI/RFI Suppression:** Used in power supply circuits to filter out noise and prevent interference.
- **Line-to-Line Filtering:** Helps in reducing noise between two AC lines.
- **Line-to-Ground Filtering:** Protects against voltage spikes and transients by filtering noise to ground.
- **Primary and Secondary Coupling in Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS):** Ensures stable operation and reduces noise in power conversion applications.

This capacitor is ideal for use in consumer electronics, industrial equipment, and any application where reliable EMI suppression is critical. Its robust design and high voltage ratings make it suitable for a wide range of applications in various environments.
