When \nVDD voltage reaches 4.7V, the start -up \nprocedure ends and the chip enters soft \nstart stage.  \n \n◆ Soft Start  \nAfter power -on, the chip begins to output \nPWM pulses. In order to prevent the \ninstantaneous output volta ge overshoot, \nthe transformer core saturation, power \ntransistor and secondary rectifier over \nstressed, the chip has a 16mS soft start \ncircuit. Within 16mS, the PWM turn -on time \nis gradually increased to increase peak \ncurrent linearly from 100mA to the \nmaxi mum peak current.  \n \n◆ FB Detection  \nThe chip adopts a PWM control method \nthat limits the peak current cycle by cycle, \nand adjusts the limiting current by \ndetecting the feedback voltage of the FB. \nWhen the PWM is turned on, the chip \ndetects the power transistor  output current \nuntil the power transistor output current \nreaches the current limit current, then turns \noff the power transistor and waits for the \nnext PWM turn -on period. The FB voltage \nis linearly regulated between 1.5 and 2.5V \nto limit the current. 1.5V  corresponds to the \nmaximum limit current, and 2.5V \ncorresponds to the minimum limit current. \nWhen the load is increased, the FB voltage \nwill gradually decrease; otherwise, the FB \nvoltage will gradually increase. When the \nload is too heavy and the FB volta ge is \nless than 1.5V, the chip will enter the short circuit or overload protection decision. \nWhen the load is very light and the FB \nvoltage is greater than 2.5V, the control \ncurrent will reduce the PWM switching \nfrequency from 65KHz to 22KHz and turn \non at  the minimum on time. When the load \nis lighter, the FB voltage will continue to \nrise. When the FB voltage is higher than \n2.8V, the control circuit stops the PWM \noutput and the chip enters burst mode.  \n \n◆ Burst Mode  \nDuring standby, the FB voltage will rise \nabove 2.8V and the chip will stop PWM \noutput. When the output voltage drops \nslightly and the FB voltage is lower than \n2.8V, the chip will re -output some PWM \npulses to maintain the set output voltage. \nThis burst output mode allows lower \nstandby power consum ption.  \n \n◆ Frequency Modulation  \nIn order to meet the design requirements \nof EMI and reduce the design complexity \nand cost, a frequency modulation circuit is \ndesigned in the chip. The frequency of \nPWM will be centered at 65KHz and run at \n16 frequency points wi th a step frequency \nof 0.5KHz.  \n \n◆ Self power supply  \nWith built -in patented self power supply \ncircuit, the chip can maintain VDD voltage \naround 4.7V to provide current \nconsumption of the chip itself. No need of \nexternal auxiliary winding.  \n \n◆ Peak Current Protec tion \nOnce the chip detects the peak current of \nthe power transistor is over 1.3A, the \npower transi stor is closed to protect the \n DK106/112/124/125  \n-------- ------------------------------------------ CONFIDENTIAL ------------------------------------  VER 4 .1A 6 \nDK SEMICONDUCTOR Wuxi CO., LTD JULY.2019  \ntransistor and prevent other components \nfrom damaging.  \n \n◆ Power Supply Abnormal  \nWhen the VDD voltage is lower than 3.6V \ndue to an external abnormality, the chip \nturns off the power transistor and restarts.  \nWhen the VDD voltage is higher than 6.5V \ndue to an external abnormality, the VDD \novervoltage protection is immediately \nstarted, and the pulse output is stopped \nuntil the VDD overvo ltage condition is \ncontacted.  \n \n◆ FB voltage abnormal protection  \nWhen the secondary side is open circuited, \nVOR voltage will increase continuously. \nOnce the chip detects the FB voltage is \nover 3.7V, the chip enters abnormal \nprotection mode. Once the chip dete cts FB \nresistor open -circuited, it enters abnormal \nprotection.  \n \n◆ Power transistor over voltage  \nprotection  \nSecondary open circuit, input bus voltage \ntoo high and transformer leakage \ninductance too large, which will cause the \npeak voltage of the power transis tor OC to \nbe too high. In order to protect the power \ntransistor from being damaged, when the \ncircuit detects that the power transistor OC voltage exceeds 600V, it will immediately \npull up the FB voltage and stop the PWM \npulse output until the power transis tor \novervoltage condition is released.  \n \n◆ Short circuit protection  \nWhen the secondary output is shorted or \noverloaded, the FB voltage will be lower \nthan 1.3V. In some applications, the \ninductive load of the motor requires a high \nstarting current at startup,  which may \ncause the circuit to be overloaded for a \nshort time. Therefore, the determination \ntime of the first overload protection of the \nchip is 512mS. If the FB voltage returns to \nnormal within 512mS, the chip will not \ndetermine an overload or short circ uit. If \nthe FB voltage is always lower than 1.3V \nwithin 512mS, it is determined that the \nsecondary output is short -circuited, the \nshort -circuit protection is immediately \nstarted, and the short -circuit protection \ndetermination time is shortened to 32mS \nuntil the short -circuit condition is released.  \n \n◆ Over temperature protection  \nOnce the chip temperature is over 130 ℃, \nthe over temperature protection start s \nimmediately. The output pulse is stopped \nuntil the over temperature condition is \nrelieved.  \n \n \n \n◼ DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS  \n◆ Power devices need heat dissipation. The majority heat of the chip comes from the power \ntransistor which is connected with OC pins. Therefore, the copper foil area outside the OC \npin should be enlarged and tinned to increase heat dissipation capacity when dealing with \nPCB layout. At the same time, this area is also the AC signal part. During EMI / EMC \ndesign, th is area should be far away from the input part as far as possible to minimize \nelectromagnetic/capacitive coupling.  \n DK106/112/124/125  \n-------- ------------------------------------------ CONFIDENTIAL ------------------------------------  VER 4 .1A 7 \nDK SEMICONDUCTOR Wuxi CO., LTD JULY.2019  \n \n◆ The OC pin of the chip is the HV part of the chip, the highest voltage can be more than \n600V. So the safe distance between the LV and HV par t should be ensured more than \n1.5mm to avoid electrical breakdown.  \n \n◆ The self power supply circuit of the chip works under high frequency, too long and too thin \nlead wire will cause the chip to work abnormally. Therefore, the external capacitance of the \nfourth pin VDD of the chip should be as close as possible to the chip and enlarge the area \nof the lead wire.  \n \n◆ Leakage inductance of transformer: Because transformer is not an ideal device, there \nmust be leakage inductance in the manufact uring process. Leakage inductance will affect \nthe stability and safety of products, so it should be reduced. The leakage inductance can \nbe controlled within 5% of the inductance. Sandwich winding method can reduce leakage \ninductance.  \n \n \n◼ DIP-8 PACKAGE OUTLINE DIMENSIONS  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSymbol  Dimensions in Millimeters  Dimensions in Inches  \nMin Max Min Max \nA 3.710 4.310 0.146 0.170 \nA1 0.510  0.020  \nA2 3.200 3.600 0.126 0.142 \nB 0.380 0.570 0.015 0.022 \nB1 1.524(BSC)  0.060(BSC)  \nC 0.204 0.360 0.008 0.014 \nD 9.000 9.400 0.354 0.370 \nE 6.200 6.600 0.244 0.260 \nE1 7.320 7.920 0.288 0.312 \ne 2.540(BSC)  0.100(BSC)  \nL 3.000 3.600 0.118 0.142 \nE2 8.400 9.200 0.331 0.354 \n'}]
