Itdraws only 1.6µA (typical) supply current from a 3.6Vsupply with the receiver enabled and the driver dis-abled. Its wide 2.5V to 5.5V supply voltage guaranteesoperation over the lifetime of a lithium battery.\nThis device features true fail-safe operation that guar-\nantees a logic-high receiver output when the receiverinputs are open or shorted. This means that the receiv-er output will be a logic high if all transmitters on a ter-minated bus are disabled (high impedance). TheMAX3471 has a 1/8-unit load input resistance. Whendriver outputs are enabled and pulled above V\nCCor\nbelow GND, internal circuitry prevents battery back-charging.\nThe MAX3471 is available in an 8-pin µMAX package.\n________________________Applications\nRemote Meter Reading\nBattery-Powered Differential CommunicationsLevel Translators____________________________Features\n'1.6µA Supply Current with Receiver Enabled\n'+2.5V to +5.5V Single-Supply Operation\n'True Fail-Safe Receiver Input\n'Available in µMAX Package\n'1/8-Unit-Load Receiver Input\n'-7V to +10V Common-Mode Input Voltage Range\nMAX34711.6µA, RS-485/RS-422, Half-Duplex, \nDifferential Transceiver for Battery-Powered Systems\n________________________________________________________________ Maxim Integrated Products 11\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5VCC\nB\nA\nGND DIDERERO\nMAX3471\nµMAXTOP VIEW___________________Pin Configuration\nMAX3471B\nAB\nA\nRDIVCC\nVCC GNDGND\nREMOTE UNITDE\nROD\nRERDE\nDI\nROD\nRE\nR\nDI DEDBA\nRERO\nTYPICAL HALF-DUPLEX RS-485 NETWORKR\nDI DEDBA\nREROVCC GNDVCCVCC0.1µF\nCENTRAL UNIT\nREMOTE UNIT REMOTE UNIT19-0497; Rev 0; 2/98\nPART\nMAX3471CUA\nMAX3471EUA -40°C to +85°C0°C to +70°CTEMP.

Its wide 2.5V to 5.5V\nsupply voltage guarantees operation over the lifetime ofa lithium battery. This device contains one driver andone receiver. Its true fail-safe receiver input guaranteesa logic-high receiver output when the receiver inputsare open or shorted, or when they are connected to aterminated transmission line with all drivers disabled.Reduced-slew-rate drivers minimize EMI and reducereflections caused by improperly terminated cables,allowing error-free data transmission up to 64kbps.\nReceiver Input Filtering\nThe MAX3471 receiver operates at up to 64kbps andincorporates input filtering in addition to input hystere -sis. This filtering enhances noise immunity when differ -\nential signals have very slow rise and fall times.\nThe MAX3471 guarantees a logic-high receiver output\nwhen the receiver inputs are shorted or open, or whenthey are connected to a terminated transmission linewith all drivers disabled. This is accomplished by set -\nting the receiver threshold between -50mV and -450mV. If the differential receiver input voltage (A-B) isgreater than or equal to -50mV, RO is a logic high. If A-B is less than or equal to -450mV, RO is a logic low.In the case of a terminated bus with all transmitters dis -\nabled, the receiver’s differential input voltage is pulledto 0V by the termination. With the MAX3471’s receiverthresholds, this results in a logic high with a 50mV mini -\nmum noise margin.MAX34711.6µA, RS-485/RS-422, Half-Duplex, \nDifferential T ransceiver for Batter y-Power ed Systems\n6_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Pin Description\nRECEIVER PROPAGATION DELAY\nMAX3471toc17\nB\nDI  \n(2V/div)(2V/div)\nA-B \n(2V/div)\nRO \n(2V/div)A\n1µs/div\nDRIVER PROPAGATION DELAY\nMAX3471toc18\nB\nDI  \n(2V/div)(2V/div)\nA-B \n(1V/div)A\n400ns/div\nR = 1.5kΩ, CL = 100pF\nGround GND 5\nNoninverting Driver Output and Noninverting Receiver Input A 6\nInverting Driver Output and Inverting Receiver Input B 7\nPositive Supply: +2.5V ≤VCC≤+5.5V VCC 8Driver Input.

With a +2.5V supply, the part is guaranteed to drive up toeight standard loads (for example, 64 other MAX3471s or56 MAX3471s plus one standard load). Drive capabilityincreases significantly with supply. For example, with a +5V supply, the MAX3471 typically meets the RS-485driver output specifications (1.5V with 54 Wdifferential ter -\nmination). See the \nTypical Operating Characteristics .Reduced EMI and Reflections\nThe MAX3471 is slew-rate limited, minimizing EMI and\nreducing reflections caused by improperly terminatedcables. In general, the rise time of a transmitter directlyrelates to the length of an unterminated stub, which canbe driven with only minor waveform reflections. The fol -\nlowing equation expresses this relationship conserva -\ntively:\nLength = t\nRISE / (10 x 1.5ns/foot)\nwhere t RISE is the transmitter’s rise time.\nFor example, the MAX3471’s rise time is typically 1.3 µs,\nwhich results in excellent waveforms with a stub lengthup to 82 feet. In general, systems operate well withlonger unterminated stubs, even with severe reflec -\ntions, if the waveform settles out before the UART sam -\nples them.\nDriver Output Protection\nExcessive output current and power dissipation causedby faults or bus contention are prevented by foldbackcurrent limiting. A foldback current limit on the outputstage provides immediate protection against short cir -\ncuits over the whole common-mode voltage range (see\nTypical Operating Characteristics ).\nMAX34711.6µA, RS-485/RS-422, Half-Duplex, \nDifferential T ransceiver for Batter y-Power ed Systems\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 7Table 1.
