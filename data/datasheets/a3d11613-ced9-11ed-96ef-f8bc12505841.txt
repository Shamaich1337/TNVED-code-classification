General description\nThe 74HC573; 74HCT573 is an 8-bit D-type transparent latch with 3-state outputs. The device\nfeatures latch enable (LE) and output enable ( OE) inputs. When LE is HIGH, data at the inputs\nenter the latches. In this condition the latches are transparent, a latch output will change each time\nits corresponding D-input changes. When LE is LOW the latches store the information that was\npresent at the inputs a set-up time preceding the HIGH-to-LOW transition of LE. A HIGH on OE\ncauses the outputs to assume a high-impedance OFF-state. Operation of the OE input does not\naffect the state of the latches. Inputs include clamp diodes. This enables the use of current limiting\nresistors to interface inputs to voltages in excess of V CC.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 2.0 to 6.0 V\n•CMOS low power dissipation\n•High noise immunity\n•Input levels:\n•For 74HC573: CMOS level\n•For 74HCT573: TTL level\n•Inputs and outputs on opposite sides of package allowing easy interface with microprocessors\n•Useful as input or output port for microprocessors and microcomputers\n•3-state non-inverting outputs for bus-oriented applications\n•Common 3-state output enable input\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78 Class II Level B\n•Complies with JEDEC standards:\n•JESD8C (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•JESD7A (2.0 V to 6.0 V)\n•ESD protection:\n••HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and from -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

  - -40 °C to +125 °C
- **Package Type:**
  - SO20 (SOT163-1), TSSOP20 (SOT360-1), DHVQFN20 (SOT764-1)
- **Special Features:**
  - 8-bit D-type transparent latch with 3-state outputs
  - Latch enable (LE) and output enable (OE) inputs
  - High noise immunity and low power dissipation
  - ESD protection: HBM exceeds 2000 V, MM exceeds 200 V

  - MSL Level 1 (not specified in the provided data, but typically for standard packages)

#### Description:
The **74HCT573** is an octal D-type transparent latch with 3-state outputs. It features latch enable (LE) and output enable (OE) inputs, allowing for flexible data handling. When LE is HIGH, the data at the inputs is transferred to the latches, making them transparent. When LE is LOW, the latches hold the last input state. The outputs can be disabled to a high-impedance state using the OE input, which does not affect the latch state.

#### Typical Applications:
The 74HCT573 is commonly used in:
- **Microprocessor and Microcontroller Interfaces:** Acts as an input/output port for data transfer.
- **Bus-Oriented Applications:** The 3-state outputs allow multiple devices to share a common bus without interference.
- **Data Storage:** Useful in temporary data storage applications where data needs to be latched and held.
- **Signal Processing:** Can be used in various digital circuits for managing data flow and control signals.

This component is ideal for applications requiring reliable data latching and high-speed operation in a compact package.
