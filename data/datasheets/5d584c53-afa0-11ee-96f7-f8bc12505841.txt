- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Winding-to-winding isolation: 500 Vrms (one minute)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Irms (current that causes a 40°C temperature rise from 25°C ambient): 0.42 A

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Not explicitly stated; however, the component is designed for low power loss in filtering applications.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Ambient temperature: -40°C to +85°C
  - Maximum part temperature: +125°C (ambient + temperature rise)
  - Storage temperature: -40°C to +125°C

- **Package Type:**
  - Dimensions: 8.6 mm high x 15 mm square
  - Packaging: 300/13" reel; plastic tape with specific dimensions for automated assembly.

- **Special Features or Notes:**
  - RoHS compliant and halogen-free.
  - Resistance to soldering heat: Max three 40-second reflows at +260°C.
  - Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL): 1 (unlimited floor life at <30°C / 85% relative humidity).
  - Not suitable for medical or high-risk applications without prior approval from Coilcraft.

### Typical Applications:
The MSD1583-105KED is typically used in:
- **Power Management:** Filtering noise in power lines to ensure stable operation of electronic devices.
- **Signal Processing:** Reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI) in signal lines, enhancing the integrity of data transmission.
- **Coupled Inductor Applications:** Used in SEPIC converters for efficient power conversion in various electronic circuits.

This component is ideal for applications in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and industrial equipment where noise reduction and signal integrity are critical.
