Combining high speed CMOS and \nmonolithic air core transformer technology, this isolation \ncomponent provides outstanding performance characteristics superior to alternatives, such as optocoupler devices. \nConfigured as a pin -compatible replacement for existing high \nspeed o ptocouplers, the ADuM1100 supports data rates as high \nas 25 Mbps and 100 Mbps.  \nThe ADuM1100 operates with a voltage supply ran ging from \n3.0 V to 5.5 V , boasts a propagation delay of <18 ns and edge \nasymmetry of <2 ns, and is compatible with temperatures up  \nto 125°C. It operates at very low power, less than 0.9 mA of quiescent current (sum of both sides), and a dynamic current  \nof less than 160 μA per Mbps of data rate. Unlike other optocoupler  \nalternatives, the ADuM1100 provides dc correctness with a \npatented refresh feature that continuously updates the output signal. \nThe ADuM1100 is offered in three grades. The ADuM1100AR \nand ADuM1100BR can operate up to a maximum temperature of 105°C and support data rates up to 25 Mbps and 100 Mbps, respectively. The ADuM1100UR can operate up to a maximum temperature of 125°C and supports data rates up to 100 Mbps.  \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \nWATCHDOGE\nN\nC\nO\nD\nED\nE\nC\nO\nD\nE\nUPDATEVDD1\nVI\n(DATA IN)\nVDD1\nGND 1VDD2\nGND 2\nVO\n(DATA OUT)\nGND 2\nADuM1100\nNOTES\n1.

See the Propagation Delay -Related Parameters  section and Figure 14 through Figure 18 for information on the \nimpact of given input rise/fall times on these parameters.  \n6 Pulse width  distortion change vs.  temperature is the absolu te value of the change in pulse width  distortion for a 1°C change in operating temperature.  \n7 tPSK1 is the magnitude of the worst -case difference in t PHL and/or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating temp erature and output load within the \nrecommended operating conditions. t PSK2 is the magnitude of the worst -case difference in t PHL and/or t PLH that is measured between units at the same operating \ntemperature, supply voltages, and output load within the recommended operating conditions.  \n8 CM H is the maximum common -mode voltage sl ew rate that can be sustained while maintaining V O > 0.8 V DD2. CM L is the maximum common -mode voltage slew rate \nthat can be sustained while maintaining V O < 0.8 V. The common -mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling edges. The transient mag nitude is the range \nover which the common mode is slewed.  \n9 Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See  Figure 5 and Figure 6 for information on \nsupply current variation with logic signal frequency.

A bypass capacitor is recom-\nmended at the input and output supply pins. The input bypass capacitor can conveniently be connected between Pin 3 and \nPin 4 (see Figure 13). Alternatively, the bypass capacitor can be \nlocated between Pin 1 and Pin 4. The output bypass capacitor can be connected between Pin 7 and Pin 8 or Pin 5 and Pin 8. The capacitor value should be between 0.01 μF and 0.1 μF. The total lead length between both ends of the capacitor and the \npower supply pins should not exceed 20 mm. \nVDD1\nVI (DATA IN)\nGND1VDD2\nVO (DATA OUT)\nGND2(OPTIONAL)\n02462-013 \nFigure 13. Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout \nSee the AN-1109 Application Note  for board layout guidelines. \nPROPAGATION DELAY-RELATED PARAMETERS \nPropagation delay time describes the length of time it takes for  \na logic signal to propagate through a component. Propagation \ndelay time to logic low output and propagation delay time to \nlogic high output refer to the duration between an input  \nsignal transition and the respective output signal transition  \n(see Figure 14). \nINPUT (VI)\nOUTPUT (V O)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n02462-014 \nFigure 14. Propagation Delay Parameters Pulse width distortion is the maximum difference between  \ntPLH and t PHL and provides an indication of how accurately the \ninput signal’s timing is preserved in the component’s output signal. Propagation delay skew is the difference between the \nminimum and maximum propagation delay values among \nmultiple ADuM1100  components operated at the same \noperating temperature and having the same output load. \nDepending on the input signal rise/fall time, the measured \npropagation delay based on the input 50% level can vary from the true propagation delay of the component (as measured from its input switching threshold). This is because the input threshold, \nas is the case with commonly used optocouplers, is at a different \nvoltage level than the 50% point of typical input signals. This \npropagation delay difference is given by \nΔ\nLH = t′PLH − tPLH = (tR/0.8 VI)(0.5 VI − VITH (L-H) ) \nΔHL = t′PHL − tPHL = (tF/0.8 VI)(0.5 VI − V ITH (H-L) ) \nwhere: \ntPLH and tPHL are the propagation delays as measured from the \ninput 50% level. \nt’PLH and  t’PHL are the propagation delays as measured from the \ninput switching thresholds. \ntR and  tF are the input 10% to 90% rise/fall times. \nVI is the amplitude of the input signal (0 V to V I levels assumed). \nVITH (L–H)  and  VITH (H–L)  are the input switching thresholds. \n \n \n∆LH\nVITH(H–L)\nINPUT (VI)VITH(L–H)VI∆HL\ntPHLt'PHL tPLH\nt'PLH\nOUTPUT (VO)50%\n50%\n02462-015 \nFigure 15.

This impact can either increase or decrease the apparent \npulse width  distortion depending on the relative magnitudes of \ntPHL, tPLH, and PWD. The case of interest he re is the condition \nthat leads to the largest increase in pulse width  distortion. The \nchange in this case is given by  \n∆PWD = PWD′ − PWD = ∆ LH − ∆ HL = \n(t/0.8 VI)(V − VITH (L-H) − VITH (H-L)), (for t = tR = tF) \nwhere:  \nPWD  = |tPLH − tPHL|. \nPWD’ = |t’PLH − t’PHL|. \nThis adjustment in pulse width  distortion is plotted as a \nfunction of input rise/fall time in Figure 18.

Typical Pulse W idth  Distortion Adjustment D ue to  \nInput Rise/Fall Time Variation ( for VDD1 = 3.3 V and 5 V)  \nMETHOD OF OPERATION,  DC CORRECTNESS, AND \nMAGNETIC FIELD IMMUN ITY \nThe two coils in Figure 1 act as a pulse transformer. Positive  \nand negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause narrow (2 ns) pulses to be sent via the transformer to the decoder. The \ndecoder is bistable and therefore either set or reset by the pulses \nindicating input logic transitions. In the absence of logic transi -\ntions at the input for more than ~1 μs, a periodic update pulse \nof the appropriate polarity is sent to ensure dc correctness at the \noutput. If the decoder receives none of these upda te pulses for \nmore than  about 5 μs, the input side is assumed to be unpowere d \nor nonfunctional, in which case the isolator output is forced to  a logic high state by the watchdog timer circuit.  \nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity  of the \nADuM1100 is set by the condition in which induced voltage in \nthe transformer’s recei ving coil is sufficiently large  to either \nfalsely set or reset the decoder. The analysis that follows defines the co nditions under which this can occur. The 3.3 V operating \ncondition of the ADuM1100 is examined because it represents \nthe most susceptible mode of operation.  \nThe pulses at the transformer outp ut are greater than 1.0 V in \namplitude. The decoder has sensing thresholds at about 0.5 V , therefore establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil  \nis given by  \nV = (− dβ/dt) ∑π r\nn2, n = 1, 2, . . . , N  \nwhere:  \nβ is the  magnetic flux den sity ( gauss).  \nN is the  number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nrn is the  radius of  the nth turn in  the receiving coil (cm).  \nADuM1100  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. K | Page 18 of 20 Given the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM1100 and \nan imposed requirement that the induced voltage be at most \n50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic field is calculated, as shown in Figure 19. \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n0.00110\n0.010.11\n1k 10k 100k 1M 10M 100M\n02462-019\n \nFigure 19. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Field  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 k gauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the sensing threshold and does  not cause a faulty output transition. \nSimilarly, if such an event were to occur during a transmitted pulse (and was of the worst -case polarity), it would reduce the \nreceived pulse from >1.0 V to 0.75 V , still well above the 0.5 V \nsensing  threshold of the decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to specific current magnitudes at given distances away from the ADuM1100 transformers. Figure 20 expresses these allowable \ncurrent magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected distances. As can be seen, the ADuM1100 is extremely immune \nand can be affected only by extre mely large currents operated at \nhigh frequency and very close to the component. For the 1 MHz example noted, one would have to place a current of 0.5 kA 5 mm away from the ADuM1100 to affect the compone nt’s \noperation.

Maximum Allowable Current for  \nVarious Current -to-ADuM1100  Spacings  \nNote that at combinations of strong magnetic field and hig h \nfrequency, any loops formed by printed circuit board traces could induce sufficiently large error voltages to trigger the thresholds of succeeding circuitry. Care should be taken in the \nlayout of such traces to avoid this possibility.  \nPOWER CONSUMPTION  \nThe supply current of the ADuM1100 isolator is a function of \nthe supply voltage, the input data rate, and the output load.  \nThe input supply current is given by  \nIDDI = I DDI (Q) f ≤ 0.5 fr \nIDDI = IDDI (D)  × (2f − fr) + I DDI (Q)  f > 0.5 fr \nThe output supply current is given by  \nIDDO = I DDO (Q) f ≤ 0.5 fr \nIDDO = (IDDO (D) + (0.5 × 10−3) × C LVDDO) × (2 f − fr) + IDDO (Q) \n f > 0.5 fr \nwhere:  \nIDDI (D) , IDDO (D)  are the input and output dynamic supply current s \nper channel (mA/Mbps).  \nCL is the output load capacitance (pF).  \nVDDO is the output supply voltage (V ). \nf is the input logic signal frequency (MHz, half the input data \nrate, NRZ signaling).  \nfr is the input stage refresh rate (Mbps).  \nIDDI (Q) , IDDO (Q)  are the specified input and output quiescent  \nsupply currents (mA).  \n \n \nData Sheet ADuM1100\n \nRev.
