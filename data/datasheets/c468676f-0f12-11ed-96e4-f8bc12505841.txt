The control-function implementationminimizes external timing requirements. Thesedevices can be used as two 8-bit transceivers orone 16-bit transceiver. They allow data transmission from the A bus to the B bus or from the B bus to the A bus,depending on the logic level at the direction-control (DIR) input. The output-enable (OE\n) input can be used to\ndisable the device so that the buses are effectively isolated. When OE  is low, the device is active.\nThe B port has an equivalent 25- Ω series output resistor to reduce ringing. Active bus-hold inputs also are on\nthe B port to hold unused or floating inputs at a valid logic level.\nThe A port provides for the precharging of the outputs via V CCBIAS, which establishes a voltage between 1.3 V\nand 1.7 V when V CC is not connected.\nActive bus-hold circuitry holds unused or undriven inputs at a valid logic state. Use of pullup or pulldown resistors\nwith the bus-hold circuitry is not recommended.\nCopyright \uf8e9 2001, Texas Instruments Incorporated PRODUCTION DATA information is current as of publication date.\nProducts conform to specifications per the terms of Texas Instruments\nstandard warranty.

#### Description:
The SN74ABTE16245 is a 16-bit incident-wave switching bus transceiver designed for high-speed data communication between two buses. It features three-state outputs, allowing for effective isolation of the buses when not in use. The device can function as either two 8-bit transceivers or one 16-bit transceiver, facilitating flexible data transmission depending on the logic level at the direction-control (DIR) input. The output-enable (OE) input allows for disabling the device, ensuring that the buses are isolated when necessary.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Data Communication:** Used in systems requiring high-speed data transfer between multiple buses, such as in telecommunications and computer networking.
- **Bus Interface:** Ideal for interfacing between different bus architectures, particularly in applications adhering to the VME64 ETL specification.
- **Signal Processing:** Suitable for applications that require robust signal integrity and minimal distortion during data transmission.
- **Embedded Systems:** Commonly used in embedded systems where multiple data lines need to be managed efficiently.

This component is part of the Texas Instruments Widebus family, which emphasizes high drive capabilities and reduced signal distortion, making it suitable for demanding electronic applications.
