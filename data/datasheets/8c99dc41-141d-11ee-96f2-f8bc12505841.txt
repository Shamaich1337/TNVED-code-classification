B | Page 7  of 10 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM202 is an RS -232 driver/receiver designed to solve \ninterface problems by meeting the TIA/ EIA-232E specifications \nwhile using a single digital 5 V supply. The EIA standard \nrequires that transmitters deliver ±5 V minimum on the \ntransmission channel and  that receivers can accept signal levels \ndown to ±3 V . The device  achieve s this by  integrating step-up \nvoltage converters and level shifting transmitters and receivers on the same chip. CMOS technology keep s the power  dissipation \nto an absolute minimum.  \nThe ADM202 contains an internal volta ge doubler and a voltage \ninverter that generates ±10 V from the 5 V input. External \n0.1 μF capacitors are required for the internal voltage converter.  \n \nADM202  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 8  of 10 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nThe internal circuit ry consists of three main sections , as follows:  \n• A charge pump dc -to-dc voltage converter  \n• TTL/CMOS to RS -232 transmitters  \n• RS-232 to TTL/CMOS receivers  \nCHARGE PUMP DC -TO-DC VOLTAGE CONVERTER  \nThe charge pump voltage converter consists of an oscillator and \na switching matr ix. The converter generates a ±10 V supply  from \nthe input 5 V level in two stages , using a switched capacitor \ntechnique as illustrated  in Figure 9 and Figure 10. First, the 5 V \ninput supply is doubled to 10 V using Capacitor C1 as the \ncharge storage element. The 10 V level is then inverted to generate −10 V using C2 as the storage element.  \nCapacitors C3 and C4 reduce the output ripple. Their values are \nnot critical and can be reduced if higher levels of ripple are \nacceptable. The charge pump capacitors , C1 and C2 , can also be \nreduced at the expense of higher output im pedance on the V+ \nand V − supplies.  \nThe V+ and V − supplies can be used to power external circuitry \nif the current requirements are small.  \n+ +S3 S1\nV+ = 2V CC\nS4 S2\nINTERNAL\nOSCILLATORC3 C1VCC\nGND VCC\n00065-009 \nFigure 9.

Charge Pump Voltage Inverter TTL/CMOS TO RS -232 T RANSMITTERS  (DRIVERS)  \nThe drivers convert TTL/CMOS input levels into TIA/ EIA-232- E \noutput levels. With VCC = 5 V and driving a typical TIA/ EIA-232-E \nload , the output voltage swing is ± 9 V . Even under worst  case \nconditions , the drive rs are guaranteed to meet the ± 5 V TIA/ EIA-\n232- E minimum requirement.  \nThe input threshold leve ls are both TTL and CMOS compat ible \nwith the switching threshold set at VCC/4. With a nominal VCC = \n5 V, the switching threshold is 1.25 V ty pical. Unused inputs can \nbe left unconnected, as an internal 400 k Ω pull-up resistor pulls \nthem high, forcing the outputs into a low state.  \nAs required by the TIA/ EIA-232- E standard , the slew rate is \nlimited to less than 30 V/µ s without the need for an external \nslew limiting capacitor , and the output impedance in the powe r-\ndown  state i s greater than 300 Ω.  \nRS-232 TO TTL/CMOS RECEIVERS  \nThe receivers are inverting level shifters that accept TIA/ EIA-232-E \ninput levels (±5 V to ± 15 V) and tr anslate them into 5 V TTL/  \nCMOS levels. The inputs have internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistors \nto ground and are protected against overvoltages of up to  ±30 V . \nThe guaranteed switching thresholds are 0.8 V (VINL) and 2.4 V \n(VINH), which are well within the ± 3 V TIA/ EIA-232- E require -\nment. The low level threshold is deliberately positive because  it \nensures that an unconnected input is  interpreted as a low level.  \nThe receivers have a Schmitt trigger ed input with a hysteresis \nlevel of 0.5 V . This  hysteresis leve l ensures error free reception , \nboth for noisy inputs and for inputs with slow transition times.  \n \n \nData Sheet  ADM202  \n \nRev.
