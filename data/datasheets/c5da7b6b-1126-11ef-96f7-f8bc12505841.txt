It has fail-safe, over-voltage protection and over-current protection. The SP3485E allows error-free data transmissi-\non up to 12Mbps.\n2 Allowing up to 256 transceivers on the bus\nThe standard RS-485 receiver has an input impedance of 12kΩ (1 unit load), and the standard driver can drive up to 32 unit\nloads. The receiver of the SP3485E transceiver has a 1/8 unit load receiver input impedance (96kΩ), allowing up to 256 tran-\nsceivers to be connected in parallel on one bus. These devices can be combined arbitrarily, or combined with other RS-485 \ntransceivers, as long as the total load does not exceed 32 units.\n3 Driver output protection\nTwo mechanisms are used to avoid faults or bus collisions that cause excessive output current and excessive power\nconsumption. First, over-current protection provides fast short-circuit protection over the entire common-mode voltage range \n(refer to the typical operating characteristics). Second, the thermal shutdown circuit forces the driver output into a high-\nimpedance state when the die temperature exceeds 140°C.4\n Typical applications\n4.1 Bus networking : The SP3485E RS485 transceiver is designed for bidirectional data communication on\nmulti-point bus transmission lines. Figure 9 shows a typical network application circuit. These devices can also be used\nas linear repeaters with cables longer than 4000 feet. In order to reduce reflections, terminal matching should be done \nat both ends of the transmission line with their characteristic impedance, and the length of the branch wires other than \nthe main line should be as short as possible.\nFig. 9 Bus-type RS485 half-duplex communication networkGeneral description\nwww.umw-ic.com  10 友台半导体有限公司SP3485E\n3.3V power supply, up to 256 nodes, 12Mbps half-duplex,\nRS485/RS422 transceiver\nUMW                                  R\n4.2 Hand-in-hand networking : Also known as daisy chain topology, it is the standard and specification of RS485\nbus wiring, and is the RS485 bus topology recommended by organizations such as TIA. The wiring method is that the\nmaster control device and multiple slave devices form a hand-in-hand connection, as shown in Figure 10, the hand-in-\nhand way is to leave no branches. This wiring method has the advantages of low signal reflection and high\ncommunication success rate. \nFig. 10 Hand-in-hand type RS485 half-duplex communication network\n4.3Bus port protection : In harsh environments, RS485 communication ports are usually protected against\nstatic electricity, lightning and surge protection, etc. and it is even necessary to prevent 380V power supply access to\navoid damage of smart meters and industrial control hosts.
