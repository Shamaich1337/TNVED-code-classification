Application Circuit\nCOMPONENT SELECTION\nThe values for the components used in this design\nexample were selected for low output ripple voltage andsmall PCB area. Additional design information is available\nat www.ti.com.\nINPUT FILTER\nThe input voltage is a nominal 5 VDC. The input filter C10is a 10- µF ceramic capacitor (Taiyo Yuden). C12, also a\n10-µF ceramic capacitor (Taiyo Yuden) provides high\nfrequency decoupling of the TPS54810 from the inputsupply and must be located as close as possible to thedevice. Ripple current is carried in both C10 and C12, and\nthe return path to PGND should avoid the current\ncirculating in the output capacitors C5, C7, and C8.\nFEEDBACK CIRCUIT\nThe values for these components have been selected toprovide low output ripple voltage. The resistor dividernetwork of R1 and R4 sets the output voltage for the circuitat 1.8 V. R1, along with R2, R3, C1, C2, and C4 forms the\nloop compensation network for the circuit. For this design,\na Type 3 topology is used.\nOPERATING FREQUENCY\nIn the application circuit, RT is grounded through a 71.5 k Ω\nresistor to select the operating frequency of 700 kHz. Toset a different frequency , place a 68 k Ω to 180 k Ω resistor\nbetween RT (pin 28) and analog ground or leave RT\nfloating to select the default of 350 kHz. The resistance can\nbe approximated using the following equation:\nR/C0043500 kHz\nSwitching Frequency/C0032100 [k /C0087]\nOUTPUT FILTER\nThe output filter is composed of a 0.65- µH inductor and\n3 x 22- µF capacitor. The inductor is a low dc resistance\n(0.017 Ω) type, Pulse Engineering PA0277. The\ncapacitors used are 22- µF, 6.3 V ceramic types with X5R\ndielectric. The feedback loop is compensated so that theunity gain frequency is approximately 75 kHz.(1)\nTPS54810\nSLVS420B − MARCH 2002 − R EVISED FEBRUARY 2005www.ti.com\n9PCB LAYOUT\nFigure 10 shows a generalized PCB layout guide for the\nTPS54810\nThe VIN pins are connected together on the printed-circuit\nboard (PCB) and bypassed with a low-ESRceramic-bypass capacitor. Care should be taken to\nminimize the loop area formed by the bypass capacitor\nconnections, the VIN pins, and the TPS54810 groundpins. The minimum recommended bypass capacitance is\n10-µF ceramic capacitor with a X5R or X7R dielectric and\nthe optimum placement is closest to the VIN pins and the\nPGND pins.\nThe TPS54810 has two internal grounds (analog and\npower). Inside the TPS54810, the analog ground ties to all\nof the noise sensitive signals, while the power ground tiesto the noisier power signals. Noise injected between thetwo grounds can degrade the performance of theTPS54810, particularly at higher output currents. Ground\nnoise on an analog ground plane can also cause problems\nwith some of the control and bias signals. For these\nreasons, separate analog and power ground traces arerecommended. There is an area of ground on the top layer\ndirectly under the IC, with an exposed area for connection\nto the PowerPAD. Use vias to connect this ground area toany internal ground planes. Additional vias are also used\nat the ground side of the input and output filter capacitors.\nThe AGND and PGND pins are tied to the PCB ground byconnecting them to the ground area under the device asshown. The only components that tie directly to the power\nground plane are the input capacitors, the outputcapacitors, the input voltage decoupling capacitor, and the\nPGND pins of the TPS54810. Use a separate wide tracefor the analog ground signal path. The analog ground isused for the voltage set point divider, timing resistor RT,slow-start c apacitor and bias capacitor grounds. Connect\nthis trace directly to AGND (Pin 1).\nThe PH pins are tied together and routed to the output\ninductor. Since the PH connection is the switching node,the inductor is located close to the PH pins. The area of thePCB conductor is minimized to prevent excessivecapacitive coupling.\nConnect the boot capacitor between the phase node and\nthe BOOT pin as shown  Keep the boot capacitor close tothe IC and minimize the conductor trace lengths.\nConnect the output filter capacitor(s) as shown between\nthe VOUT trace and PGND.  It is important to keep the loop\nformed by the PH pins, L\nOUT, COUT and PGND as small as\npractical.\nPlace the compensation components from the VOUT trace\nto the VSENSE and COMP pins. Do not place thesecomponents too close to the PH trace.  Due to the size of\nthe IC package and the device pin-out, they must be routedclose, but maintain as much separation as possible while\nstill keeping the layout compact.\nConnect the bias capacitor from the VBIAS pin to analog\nground using the isolated analog ground trace. If aslow-start capacitor or RT resistor is used, or if the SYNC\npin is used to select 350-kHz operating frequency, connectthem to this trace.\nTPS54810\nSLVS420B − MARCH 2002 − R EVISED FEBRUARY 2005www.ti.com\n10AGND\nBOOTVSENSE\nCOMP\nPWRGD\nPH\nPH\nPH\nPH\nPH\nPH\nPH\nPHPHRT\nSYNC\nSS/ENA\nVBIAS\nVIN\nVIN\nVIN\nVINVIN\nPGND\nPGNDPGNDPGNDPGNDVOUT\nPHVIN\nTOPSIDE GROUND AREA\nVIA to Ground PlaneANALOG GROUND TRACE\nEXPOSED\nPOWERP AD\nAREACOMPENSA TION\nNETWORK\nOUTPUT INDUCTOR\nOUTPUT\nFILTERCAPACITORBOOT\nCAPACITOR\nINPUT\nBYPASS\nCAPACITORINPUT\nBULK\nFILTERFREQUENCY SET RESISTOR\nSLOW ST ART\nCAPACITOR\nBIAS CAP ACITOR\nFigure 10.

A 3\ninch by 3 inch plane of 1 ounce copper is recommended,\nthough not mandatory, depending on ambient temperature\nand airflow . Most applications have larger areas of internal\nground plane available, and the PowerPAD should be\nconnected to the largest area available. Additional areason the top or bottom layers also help dissipate heat, andany area available should be used when 8 A or greater\noperation is desired. Connection from the exposes area of\nthe PowerPAD to the analog ground plane layer should be\nmade using 0.013 inch diameter vias to avoid solderwicking through the vias.

During power up, internal circuits areheld inactive until VIN exceeds the nominal UVLOthreshold voltage of 3.80 V. Once the UVLO start threshold\nis reached, device start-up begins. The device operates\nuntil VIN falls below the nominal UVLO stop threshold of3.5 V. Hysteresis in the UVLO comparator, and a 2.5- µs\nrising and falling edge deglitch circuit reduce the likelihood\nof shutting the device down due to noise on VIN.\nSlow-Start/Enable (SS/ENA)\nThe slow-start/enable pin provides two functions. First, thepin acts as an enable (shutdown) control by keeping the\ndevice turned off until the voltage exceeds the startthreshold voltage of approximately 1.2 V. When SS/ENAexceeds the enable threshold, device start up begins. The\nreference voltage fed to the error amplifier is linearly\nramped up from 0 V to 0.891 V in 3.35 ms. Similarly, theconverter output voltage reaches regulation inapproximately 3.35 ms. Voltage hysteresis and a 2.5- µs\nfalling edge deglitch circuit reduce the likelihood of\ntriggering the enable due to noise.\nThe second function of the SS/ENA pin provides an\nexternal means of extending the slow-start time with alow-value capacitor connected between SS/ENA andAGND.\nAdding a capacitor to the SS/ENA pin has two effects on\nstart-up. First, a delay occurs between release of theSS/ENA pin and start up of the output. The delay is\nproportional to the slow-start capacitor value and lasts until\nthe SS/ENA pin reaches the enable threshold. Thestart-up delay is approximately:\ntd/C0043C(SS)/C00321.2 V\n5/C0109A\nSecond, as the output becomes active, a brief ramp-up at\nthe internal slow-start rate may be observed before the\nexternally set slow-start rate takes control and the output\nrises at a rate proportional to the slow-start capacitor. The\nramp-up time set by the capacitor is approximately:\nt(d)/C0043C(SS)/C00320.7 V\n5/C0109A\nThe actual ramp-up time is likely to be less than the above\napproximation due to the brief ramp-up at the internal rate.\nVBIAS Regulator (VBIAS)\nThe VBIAS regulator provides internal analog and digital\nblocks with a stable supply voltage over variations injunction temperature and input voltage. A high quality,low-ESR, ceramic bypass capacitor is required on the\nVBIAS pin. X7R or X5R grade dielectrics are\nrecommended because their values are more stable over\ntemperature. The bypass capacitor should be placed close\nto the VBIAS pin and returned to AGND.\nExternal loading on VBIAS is allowed, with the caution that\ninternal circuits require a minimum VBIAS of 2.70 V, andexternal loads on VBIAS with ac or digital switching noise\nmay degrade performance. The VBIAS pin may be useful\nas a reference voltage for external circuits.\nVoltage Reference\nThe voltage reference system produces a precise V ref\nsignal by scaling the output of a temperature stable\nbandgap circuit. During manufacture, the bandgap andscaling circuits are trimmed to produce 0.891 V at theoutput of the error amplifier, with the amplifier connected\nas a voltage follower. The trim procedure adds to the high\nprecision regulation of the TPS54810, since it cancelsoffset errors in the scale and error amplifier circuits.\nOscillator and PWM Ramp\nThe oscillator frequency can be set to internally fixedvalues of 350 kHz or 550 kHz using the SYNC pin as astatic digital input. If a different frequency of operation is\nrequired for the application, the oscillator frequency can be\nexternally adjusted from 280 to 700 kHz by connecting aresistor between the RT pin and AGND and floating theSYNC pin. The switching frequency is approximated by\nthe following equation, where R is the resistance from RT\nto AGND:\nSwitching Frequency /C0043100 k/C0087\nR/C0032500 [kHz]\nExternal synchronization of the PWM ramp is possible\nover the frequency range of 330 kHz to 700 kHz by driving\na synchronization signal into SYNC and connecting aresistor from RT to AGND. Choose an RT resistor which\nsets the free running frequency to 80% of the\nsynchronization signal. The following table summarizesthe frequency selection configurations:\nSWITCHING FRE-\nQUENCYSYNC PIN RT PIN\n350 kHz, internally set Float or AGND Float\n550 kHz, internally set =2.5 V Float\nExternally set 280 kHzto 700 kHz Float R = 68 k to 180 k\nExternally synchro-nized frequency Synchronizationsignal R = RT value for 85%of external synchro-nization frequency\nError Amplifier\nThe high performance, wide bandwidth, voltage error\namplifier sets the TPS54810 apart from most dc/dc\nconverters. The user is given the flexibility to use a widerange of output L and C filter components to suit the(2)\n(3)(4)\nTPS54810\nSLVS420B − MARCH 2002 − R EVISED FEBRUARY 2005www.ti.com\n14particular application needs. Type 2 or type 3 compensa-\ntion can be employed using external compensation\ncomponents.\nPWM Control\nSignals from the error amplifier output, oscillator, and\ncurrent limit circuit are processed by the PWM control\nlogic. Referring to the internal block diagram, the controllogic includes the PWM comparator, OR gate, PWM latch,\nand portions of the adaptive dead-time and control logic\nblock. During steady-state operation below the currentlimit threshold, the PWM comparator output and oscillator\npulse train alternately reset and set the PWM latch. Once\nthe PWM latch is reset, the low-side FET remains on for a\nminimum duration set by the oscillator pulse width. During\nthis period, the PWM ramp discharges rapidly to its valleyvoltage. When the ramp begins to charge back up, the\nlow-side FET turns off and high-side FET turns on. As the\nPWM ramp voltage exceeds the error amplifier outputvoltage, the PWM comparator resets the latch, thusturning off the high-side FET and turning on the low-side\nFET. The low-side FET remains on until the next oscillator\npulse discharges the PWM ramp.\nDuring transient conditions, the error amplifier output\ncould be below the PWM ramp valley voltage or above the\nPWM peak voltage. If the error amplifier is high, the PWMlatch is never reset and the high-side FET remains on until\nthe oscillator pulse signals the control logic to turn the\nhigh-side FET off and the low-side FET on. The deviceoperates at its maximum duty cycle until the output voltage\nrises to the regulation set-point, setting VSENSE to\napproximately the same voltage as VREF. If the erroramplifier output is low, the PWM latch is continually resetand the high-side FET does not turn on. The low-side FET\nremains on until the VSENSE voltage decreases to a\nrange that allows the PWM comparator to change states.The TPS54810 is capable of sinking current continuouslyuntil the output reaches the regulation set-point.\nIf the current limit comparator trips for longer than 100 ns,\nthe PWM latch resets before the PWM ramp exceeds the\nerror amplifier output. The high-side FET turns off and\nlow-side FET turns on to decrease the energy in the output\ninductor and consequently the output current. Thisprocess is repeated each cycle in which the current limit\ncomparator is tripped.\nDead-Time Control and MOSFET Drivers\nAdaptive dead-time control prevents shoot-through\ncurrent from flowing in both N-channel power MOSFETs\nduring the switching transitions by actively controlling the\nturnon times of the MOSFET drivers. The high-side driver\ndoes not turn on until the voltage at the gate of the low-sideFET is below 2 V. While the low-side driver does not turn\non until the voltage at the gate of the high-side MOSFET\nis below 2 V.\nThe high-side and low-side drivers are designed with\n300-mA source and sink capability to quickly drive the\npower MOSFETs gates. The low-side driver is supplied\nfrom VIN, while the high-side drive is supplied from theBOOT pin. A bootstrap circuit uses an external BOOTcapacitor and an internal 2.5- Ω bootstrap switch\nconnected between the VIN and BOOT pins. The\nintegrated bootstrap switch improves drive efficiency andreduces external component count.\nOvercurrent Protection\nThe cycle by cycle current limiting is achieved by sensingthe current flowing through the high-side MOSFET andcomparing this signal to a preset overcurrent threshold.\nThe high side MOSFET is turned off within 200 ns of\nreaching the current limit threshold. A 100 ns leading edge\nblanking circuit prevents false tripping of the current limitwhen the high side switch is turning on. Current limit\ndetection occurs only when current flows from VIN to PH\nwhen sourcing current to the output filter. Load protectionduring current sink operation is provided by thermalshutdown.\nThermal Shutdown\nThe device uses the thermal shutdown to turn off the powerMOSFETs and disable the controller if the junction\ntemperature exceeds 150 °C. The device is released from\nshutdown automatically when the junction temperaturedecreases to 10 °C below the thermal shutdown trip point,\nand starts up under control of the slow-start  circuit.\nThermal shutdown provides protection when an overload\ncondition is sustained for several milliseconds. With a\npersistent fault condition, the device cycles continuously;starting up by control of the soft-start circuit, heating up due\nto the fault condition, and then shutting down upon\nreaching the thermal shutdown trip point. This sequence\nrepeats until the fault condition is removed.\nPower Good (PWRGD)\nThe power good circuit monitors for under voltageconditions on VSENSE. If the voltage on VSENSE is 10%\nbelow the reference voltage, the open-drain PWRGDoutput is pulled low. PWRGD is also pulled low if VIN is\nless than the UVLO threshold or SS/ENA is low. When\nVIN ≥ UVLO threshold, SS/ENA ≥ enable threshold, and\nVSENSE > 90% of V\nref, the open drain output of the\nPWRGD pin is high. A hysteresis voltage equal to 3% of\nVref and a 35 µs falling edge deglitch circuit prevent\ntripping of the power good comparator due to highfrequency noise.\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 10-Dec-2020\nAddendum-Page 1PACKAGING INFORMATION\nOrderable Device Status\n(1)Package Type Package\nDrawingPinsPackage\nQtyEco Plan\n(2)Lead finish/\nBall material\n(6)MSL Peak Temp\n(3)Op Temp (°C) Device Marking\n(4/5)Samples\nTPS54810PWP ACTIVE HTSSOP PWP 2850RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-2-260C-1 YEAR -40 to 85 TPS54810\nTPS54810PWPR ACTIVE HTSSOP PWP 282000RoHS & Green NIPDAU Level-2-260C-1 YEAR -40 to 85 TPS54810\n \n(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:\nACTIVE: Product device recommended for new designs.\nLIFEBUY:  TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.\nNRND: Not recommended for new designs.
