in a wide variety of high -volume \nconsumer based applications in which program code is shadowed from Flash memory into embedded or \nexternal RAM for execution. The flexible erase architecture of the device, with its page erase  granularity it is \nideal for data storage as well, eliminating the need for additional data storage devices.  \nThe erase block sizes of the device have been optimized to meet the needs of today\'s code and data storage \napplications. By optimizing the size of the erase blocks, the memory space can be used much more efficiently. \nBecause certain code modules and data storage segments must reside by themselves in their own erase \nregions, the wasted and unused memory space that occurs with large sectored and large block erase Flash \nmemory devices can be greatly reduced. This increased memory space efficiency allows additional code \nroutines and data storage segments to be added while still maintaining the same overall device density.  \nThe device also contains an addi tional 3* 1024 -byte security registers with OTP lock (One -Time \nProgrammable) , can be used for purposes such as unique device serialization, system -level Electronic Serial \nNumber (ESN) storage, locked key storage, etc.  \nSpecifically designed for use in many different systems, the device supports read, program, and erase \noperations with a wide supply voltage range of 2.3V to 3.6V. No separate voltage is required for programming \nand erasing.  \n \n \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 6 of 97 3 Pin Definition  \n3.1 Pin Configurations  \nCS#\nSO\nWP#HOLD#/RESET#\nSLCK\nSIVCC\nGND1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5CS#\nSO\nWP#HOLD#/RESET#\nSLCK\nSIVCC\nGND1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5\n \n8-PIN SOP (150mil/20 8mil)             8-Land USON  (6x5mm /4x4mm ) \n \n \n3.2 Pin Descriptions  (8-Pin SOP, 8 -Land USON , 8-Land WSON ) \nNo. Symbol  Extension  Remarks  \n1 CS#  Chip select  \n2 SO SIO1  Serial data output for 1 x I/O  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \n3 WP#  SIO2  Write protection active low  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \n4 GND  - Ground of the device  \n5 SI SIO0  Serial data input for 1x I/O  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \n6 SCLK  - Serial interface clock input  \n7 HOLD# /RESET#  SIO3  Hardware Reset Pin Active low or to pause the device \nwithout deselecting the device  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \n8 Vcc - Power supply of the device  \n \n\nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 7 of 97 3.3 Pin Descriptions  (24-Ball TFBGA)  \nBall \nNo. Symbol  Extension  Remarks  \nC2 CS#  Chip select  \nD2 SO SIO1  Serial data output for 1 x I/O  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \nC4 WP#  SIO2  Write protection active low  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \nB3 GND  - Ground of the device  \nD3 SI SIO0  Serial data input for 1x I/O  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \nB2 SCLK  - Serial interface clock input  \nD4 HOLD# /RESET#  SIO3  Hardware Reset Pin Active low or to pause the device \nwithout deselecting the device  \nSerial data input and output for 4 x I/O read mode  \nB4 Vcc - Power supply of the device  \n \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 8 of 97 4 Block Diagram  \n \nSerial Bus \nControl Logic\nAddress LatchFlash Memory ArrayData buffer\nY-DECODERX -DECODER\nSerial MUX &\nI/O buffersHigh Voltage Generator\nControl and\nProtection logicWP#\nHOLD# \n/ResetSOCS#\nSCK\nVCC\nGNDInterface\nControl &\nLogicSI\n \n \n \n \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 9 of 97 5 Electrical Specifications  \n5.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings  \n\uf06e Storage T emperature ....................... -65° C to +150° C  \n\uf06e Operation Temperature  ................... .-40° C  to +85° C  \n\uf06e Maximum Operation Voltage. ............ 4.0V \n\uf06e Voltage on Any Pin with  \nrespect to Grou nd. .......................... -0.6V to + 4.1V   \n\uf06e DC Output  Current ........................... .5.0 mA \n \nTable 5 -1 Pin Capacitance  [1]  \nSymbol  Parameter  Max.

The Configure Register Contains 40h (DRV1 bit \nis 1, all  other bits are 0).  \n \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 16 of 97 6 Data Protection  \nDuring power transition, there may be some false system level signals which result in inadvertent erasure or \nprogramming. The device is designed to protect itself from these accidental write cycles.  \nThe state machine wi ll be reset as standby mode automatically during power up. In addition, the control \nregister architecture of the device constrains that the memory contents can only be changed after specific \ncommand sequences have completed successfully.  \nIn the following, there are several features to protect the system from the accidental write cycles during VCC \npower -up and power -down or from system noise.  \n• Power -on reset: to avoid sudden power switch by system power supply transition, the power -on reset may \nprotect the Flash.  \n• Valid command length checking: The command length will be checked whether it is at byte base and \ncompleted on byte boundary.  \n• Write Enable (WREN) command: WREN command is required to set the Write Enable Latch bit (WEL) \nbefore issuing other comma nds to change data.  \n• Software Protection Mode: The Block Protect (BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits define the section of the \nmemory array that can be read but not change.  \n• Hardware Protection Mode: WP# going low to protected the BP0~BP4bits and SRP0~1bi ts \n• Deep Power -Down Mode: By entering deep power down mode, the flash device is under protected from \nwriting all commands except the Release form Deep Power -Down Mode command.  \nProtected Area Sizes  \nTable 6 -1.

In standby mode, SO pin of this LSI should be High -Z. When correct \ncommand is inputted to this LSI, this LSI becomes active mode and keeps the active mode until next CS# \nrising edge.  \nInput data is latched on the rising edge of Serial Clock (SCL K) and data shifts out on the falling edge of SCLK. \nThe difference of serial peripheral interface mode 0 and mode 3 is shown as Figure 8 -1.  \nFor the following instructions: RDID, RDSR, RDSR1, RDSCUR, READ, FAST_READ, DREAD, 2READ, \n4READ, QREAD, RDSFDP, RES , REMS, DREMS, QREMS, the shifted -in instruction sequence is followed \nby a data -out sequence. After any bit of data being shifted out, the CS# can be high. For the following \ninstructions: WREN, WRDI, WRSR, PE, SE, BE32K, BE, CE, PP, DPP, QPP, DP, ERSCUR, P RSCUR, \nSUSPEND, RESUME, RSTEN, RST, the CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary; otherwise, the \ninstruction will be rejected and not executed.  \nDuring the progress of Write Status Register, Program, Erase operation, to access the memory array is \nnegle cted and not affect the current operation of Write Status Register, Program, Erase.  \nFigure 8-1 Serial Peripheral Interface Modes Supported  \n \nSCLK \nMSB CPHA shift in shift out \nSI 0 \n1 CPOL \n0 (Serial mode 0) \n(Serial mode 3) 1 \nSO SCLK \nMSB \nNote:  \nCPOL  indicates  clock  polarity  of serial  maste r, CPOL=1  for SCLK  high while  idle, CPOL=0  for SCLK  low while  not transmitting.  CPHA  \nindicates  clock  phase.  The combination  of CPOL  bit and CPHA  bit decides  which  serial  mode  is supported.  \nStandard SPI  \nThe P25Q64H  features a serial peripheral interface on 4 signals bus: Serial Clock (SCLK), Chip Select (CS#), \nSerial Data Input (SI) and Serial Data Output (SO). Both SPI bus mode 0 and 3 are supported. Input data is \nlatched on the rising edge of SCLK and data shifts out on the falling edge of SCLK.  \nDual SPI  \nThe P25Q64H  supports Dual SPI operation when using the “Dual Output  Fast Read”  and “Dual I/O  Fast \nRead”(3BHand BBH)  commands. These commands  allow data to be transferred to or from the device at two \ntimes the rate  of the standard SPI.  When using  the Dual SPI command the SI and SO pins become \nbidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1.  \n \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 21 of 97    \n Quad SPI  \nThe P25Q64H  supports Quad SPI operation when using  the “Quad Output  Fast Read”,”  Quad I/O  Fast \nRead” (6BH,EBH)  commands.  These com mands allow data to be transferred to or from the device at four \ntimes the rate of the standard SPI. When using the Quad  SPI command the SI and SO pins become \nbidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1, and WP# and HOLD# pins become IO2 andIO3. Quad SPI  commands \nrequire the non -volatile Quad Enable bit(QE) in Status Register to be set.  \nQPI  \nThe P25Q64H  supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations only when the device is switched from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using  the “Enable  the QPI (38H)”command.  The QPI mode \nutilizes  all four IO pins to input the command code.  Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode and QPI mode are \nexclusive. Only one mode can be active at any given times. “Enable the QPI(38H)”and “Disable the \nQPI(FFH)”commands are use d to switch between these two modes.  Upon power -up and after software  reset \nusing “”Reset (99H)”command, the default  state of the  device is Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. The  QPI \nmode requires  the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register to be se t. \nSoftware Reset & Hardware RESET # pin  \nThe P25Q64H  can be reset to the initial power -on state by a software Reset sequence, either in SPI mode or \nQPI mode. This sequence must include two consecutive commands: Enable Reset (66h) & Reset (99h). If the \ncomm and sequence is successfully accepted, the device will take approximately 30uS ( tReady ) to reset. No \ncommand will be accepted during the reset period.  \nThe P25Q64H  can also be co nfigured to utilize a hardware RESET # pin. The HOLD/ RST bit in the Configure  \nRegister is the configuration bit for HOLD # pin function or RESET # pin function. When HOLD/RST=0 (factory \ndefault), the pin acts as a HOLD # pin as described above; when HOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as a RESET # pin. \nDrive the RESET # pin low for a minimum perio d of ~1us (tRESET*) will reset the device to its initial power -on \nstate. Any on -going Program/Erase operation will be interrupted and data corruption may happen. While \nRESET # is low, the device will not accept any command input.  \nIf QE bit is set to 1, the HOLD or RESET function will be disabled, the pin will become one of the four data I/O \npins.  \nHardware RESET # pin has the highest priority among all the input signals. Drive RESET # low for a minimum \nperiod of ~1us (tRESET*) will interrupt any on -going extern al/internal operations, regardless the status of \nother SPI signals (/CS, CLK, IOs, WP # and/or HOLD #).  \nNote:  \n1. While a faster RESET # pulse (as short as a few hundred nanoseconds) will often reset the device, a 1us \nminimum is recommended to ensure reliabl e operation.  \n2. There is an internal pull -up resistor for the dedicated RESET # pin. If the reset function is not needed, this \npin can be left floating in the system.  \n \n \n \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 22 of 97 9 Hold Feature  \nHOLD#  pin signal  goes  low to hold any serial  communications  with the device.  The HOLD  feature  will not stop \nthe operation of write status registe r, programming, or erasing in progress.  \nThe operation of  HOLD requires Chip Select(CS#) keeping  low and starts  on falling edge  of HOLD#  pin signal \nwhile  Serial  Clock  (SCLK)  signal  is being  low (if Serial  Clock  signal  is not being  low, HOLD  operation  will not \nstart until  Serial  Clock  signal  being  low).   The HOLD  condition  ends  on the rising  edge  of HOLD#  pin signal  \nwhile  Serial  Clock(SCLK)  signal  is being  low( if Serial  Clock  signal  is not being  low, HOLD  operation  will not \nend until Serial  Clock being low).  \n \nFigure 9-1 Hold Condition Operation  \nHOLD HOLD CS# \nSCLK \nHOLD# \n \nDuring the HOLD operation, the Serial Data Output (SO) is high impedance when Hold# pin goes low and will \nkeep high impedance until Hold# pin goes high. The Serial Data Input (SI) is don\'t care if both Serial Clock \n(SCLK) and Hold# pin goes low and will keep the state until SCLK goes low and Hold# pin goes high. If Chip \nSelect (CS#) drives high during HOLD operatio n, it will reset the internal logic of the device.

When WIP bit sets to 1, means the device is busy in program/erase/write status register progress, \nwhen WIP bit sets 0, means the device is  not in program/erase/write status register progress.  \n \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 31 of 97 WEL bit.  \nThe Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit indicates the status of the internal Write Enable Latch. When set to 1 the \ninternal Write Enable Latch is set, when set to 0 the internal Write Enable Latch is reset and no Write Status \nRegister, Program or Erase command is accepted.  \nBP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0 bits.  \nThe Block Protect (BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits are non -volatile. They define the size of the area to be \nsoftware protected against Program an d Erase commands. These bits are written with the Write Status \nRegister (WRSR) command. When the Block Protect (BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) bits are set to 1, the \nrelevant memory area (as defined in Table “Protected Area Sizes”).becomes protected against Page  Program \n(PP), Page Erase (PE), Sector Erase (SE) and Block Erase (BE) commands. The Block Protect (BP4, BP3, \nBP2, BP1, and BP0) bits can be written provided that the Hardware Protected mode has not been set. The \nChip Erase (CE) command is executed, only i f the Block Protect (BP4, BP3, BP2, BP1and BP0) are set to \n“None protected”.  \nSRP1, SRP0 bits.  \nThe Status Register Protect (SRP1 and SRP0) bits are non -volatile Read/Write bits in the status register. The \nSRP bits control the method of write protection: so ftware protection, hardware protection, power supply \nlock-down or one time programmable protection  \nSRP1  SRP0  WP#  Status Register  Description  \n0 0 x Software Protected  The Status Register can be written to after a Write \nEnable command, WEL=1.(Default)  \n0 1 0 Hardware Protected  WP#=0,  the Status Register locked and can not be \nwritten to.  \n0 1 1 Hardware Unprotected  WP#=1,  the Status Register is unlocked and can be \nwritten to after a Write Enable command, WEL=1.  \n \n1 0 x Power Supply \nLock -Down(1)  Status Register is protected and can not be written to \nagain until the next Power -Down, Power -Up cycle.  \n 1 1 x One Time Program(2)  Status Register is permanently protected and can not be \nwritten to.  \n NOTE:   \n1. When SRP1, SRP0=(1, 0), a Power -Down, Power -Up cycle will change SRP1, SRP0 to (0, 0) state.  \n2. This feature is available on special order. Please contact PUYA for details.  \nQE bit.  \nThe Quad Enable (QE) bit is a non -volatile Read/Write bit in the Status Register that allows Quad operation. \nWhen  the QE bit is set to 0 (Default) the WP# pin and HOLD# pin are enable. When the QE pin is set to 1, the \nQuad IO2 and IO3 pins are enabled. (The QE bit should never be set to 1 during standard SPI or Dual SPI \noperation if the WP# or HOLD# pins are tied dir ectly to the power supply or ground)  \nLB3, LB2, LB1, bits.  \nThe LB3, LB2, LB1, bits are non -volatile One Time Program (OTP) bits in Status Register (S13 -S11) that \nprovide the write protect control and status to the Security Registers. The default state of LB 3-LB1are0, the \nsecurity registers are unlocked. The LB3 -LB1bitscan be set to 1 individually using the Write Register \ninstruction. The LB3 -LB1bits are One Time Programmable, once its set to 1, the Security Registers will \nbecome read -only permanently.  \nCMP b it \nThe CMP bit is a non -volatile Read/Write bit in the Status Register(S14). It is used in conjunction the \nBP4-BP0 bits to provide more flexibility for the array protection. Please see the table “Protected Area Size” for \ndetails. The default setting is CMP =0. \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 32 of 97 SUS1, SUS2bit  \nThe SUS1 and SUS2bit are read only bit in the status register (S15and S10) that are set to 1 after executing \nan Program/Erase Suspend (75H or B0H) command (The Erase Suspend will set the SUS1 to 1,and the \nProgram Suspend will set the SUS2  to 1). The SUS1 and SUS2 bit are cleared to 0 by Program/Erase \nResume (7AH or 30H) command as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n \n10.6 Read Configure  Register (RD CR) \nThe RD CR instruction is for reading Configure  Register Bits. The Read Configure  Register can be read at any \ntime (even in program/erase/write status register condition). It is recommended to check the Write in \nProgress (WIP) bit before sending a new instruction when a program, erase, or write status register operation \nis in progress.   \nThe sequence of issuing RD CR instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending RD CR instruction code→ Configure  \nRegister data out on SO.  \nThe RDCR instruction code is 15H with ordering option "default" and 45H with ordering option "D"  \nFigure 10 -6 Read Status Register (RD CR) Sequence (Command 15) \nCommand 0     1    2     3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10  11  12  13  14  15   16  17  18   19  20   21  22   23  \n15H CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO High-Z \n7    6    5     4     3    2    1    0    7    6     5    4    3    2     1    0    7  \nMSB Configure Register Out Configure Register Out \nMSB \nFigure 10 -6a Read Status Register (RD CR) Sequence ( QPI) \n CS# \nSCLK \nSI(IO0) \nSO(IO1) \nWP#(IO2) \nHOLD#(IO3) Command\n15H0      1      2       3      4      5\n 4      0       4      0      4\n 5      1       5      1      5\n 6      2       6      2      6\n 7      3       7      3      7\nC7-C0 out\nConfigure  Register  \nBit7 Bit6 Bit5 Bit4 Bit3 Bit2 Bit1 Bit0 \nHOLD/RST  DRV1  DRV0  QP Reserved  WPS  Reserved  Reserved  \nHOLD/RST  bit. \nThe HOLD/RST bit is a non -volatile Read/Write bit in the Configure  Register  which  used to determine \nwhether /HOLD or /RESET function should be implemented on the hardware pin for 8 -pin packages. When \nHOLD/RST=0 (factory default), the pin acts as /HOLD; when HOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as /RESET. However, \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 33 of 97 /HOLD or /RESET functions are only available when QE=0.

When the QP bit is set to 0 (Default) the page size  is 256bytes . When the QP pin is set to 1, the \npage size is 1024 bytes .  \nThis bit controls the page programming buffer address wrap point. Legacy SPI devices generally have used  a \n256 Byte page programming buffer and defined that if data is loaded into the buffe r beyond the 255 Byte \nlocations , the address at  which additional bytes are loaded would be wrapped to addr ess zero of the buffer. \nThe P25Q64H  provides a 1024  Byte page  programming buffer that can increase programming performance. \nFor legacy software compatibility, this configuration bit provides  the option to continue the wrapping behavior \nat the 256 Byte boun dary or to enable full use of the available 1024  Byte buffer by not  wrapping the load \naddress at the 256 Byte boundary.  \nWhen the QP pin is set to 1,  the page erase instruction  (81h)  will erase the data of the chosen Quad  Page to \nbe "1" .  \nWPS  bit. \nThe WPS bit is a non -volatile Read/Write bit which  is used to select which Write Protect scheme should be \nused. When WPS=0 (default) , the device will use the combination of CMP, BP[ 4:0] bits to protect a specific \narea of the memory array. When WPS=1, the de vice will utilize the Individual Block Locks to protect any \nindividual sector or blocks. The default value for all Individual Block Lock bits is 1 upon device power on or \nafter reset.  \n  \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 34 of 97 10.7 Active Status Interrupt (ASI)  \nTo simplify the readout of the WIP bit, the Active Status Interrupt command (25h) may be used. It is then not \nnecessary to continuously read the status register, it is sufficient to monitor the value of the SO line. If the SO \nline is connected to an interrupt line on the host controller, the hos t controller may be in sleep mode until the \nSO line indicates that the device is ready for the next command.  \nThe WIP bit can be read at any time, including during an internally self -timed program or erase operation. To \nenable the Active Status Interrupt command, the CS pin must first be asserted and the opcode of 25h must \nbe clocked into the device. For SPI Mode3 , at least one dummy bit has to be clocked into the device after the \nlast bit of the opcode has been clocked in. (In most cases, this is most easily done by sending a dummy byte \nto the device.) The value of the SI line after the opcode is clocked in is of no significance to the operation. For \nSPI Mode 0, this dummy bit (dummy byte) is not required.  \nThe value of WIP is then output on the SO line, and is continuously updated by the device for as long as the \nCS pin remains asserted. Additional clocks on the SC K pin are not required. If the WIP bit changes from 1 to \n0 while the CS pin is asserted, the SO line will change from 1 to 0. (The WIP bit cannot change from 0 to 1 \nduring an operation, so if the SO line already is 0, it will not change.)  \nDeasserting the CS pin will terminate the Active Status Interrupt operation and put the SO pin into a \nhigh-impedance state. The CS pin can be deasserted at any time and does not require that a full byte of data \nbe read.  \nThe sequence of issuing ASI instruction is: CS# goes  low→ sending ASI instruction code→ WIP data out on \nSO \nFigure 10 -7 Active Status Interrupt (ASI) Sequence (Command 25)  \nCommand 0     1    2     3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10  11  12  13  14  15   16  17  18      \n25H CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO High - Z \n RDY/BSY  \n High - Z\n \n10.8 Write Status Register (WRSR ) \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) command allows new values to be written to the  Status Register.  For \ncommand code "01H", the new values will be written to the status register0(S7~S0). For command code \n"31H", the new values will be written to the status register1(S15~S8).  Before it can be accepted, a Write \nEnable (WREN) command must p reviously have been executed. After the Write Enable (WREN) command \nhas been decoded and executed, the device sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL).  \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) command has no effect on S15, S10, S1 and S0 of the Status Register. \nCS# must  be driven high after the eighth or sixteen bit of the data byte has been latched in. If not, the Write \nStatus Register (WRSR) command is not executed. If CS# is driven high after eighth bit of the data byte, the \nCMP and QE and SRP1 bits will be cleared to  0. As soon as CS# is driven high, the self -timed Write Status \nRegister cycle (whose duration is tW) is initiated. While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the \nStatus Register may still be read to check the value of the Write In Progress (WIP)  bit. The Write In Progress \n(WIP) bit is 1 during the self -timed Write Status Register cycle, and is 0 when it is completed.

A Quad Enable (QE) bit of \nstatus Register must be set to "1" before sending the 4READ instruct ion.

The address counter rolls over to 0 when the highest address has been reached. \nOnce writing 4READ instruction, the followin g address/dummy/data out will perform as 4 -bit instead of \nprevious 1 -bit. \nThe sequence of issuing 4READ instruction is: CS# goes low → sending 4READ instruction → 24-bit address \ninterleave on SIO3, SIO2, SIO1 & SIO0 →2+4 dummy cycles →data out interleave on SIO3, SIO2, SIO1 & \nSIO0→ to end 4READ operation can use CS# to high at any time during data out.  \nAnother sequence of issuing 4READ instruction especially useful in random access is: CS# goes low →\nsending  4READ instruction →3-bytes address interleave on SIO3,  SIO2, SIO1 & SIO0 → “Continuous Read \nMode” byte M[7:0] → 4 dummy cycles →data out still CS# goes high → CS# goes low (reduce 4 Read \ninstruction) →24-bit random access address.  \nIn the performance -enhancing mode, the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M[5:4] = (1,0 ) can make this mode \ncontinue and reduce the next 4READ instruction. Once M[5:4 ] ≠ (1,0) and afterwards CS# is raised and then \nlowered, the system then will escape from performance enhance mode and return to normal operation. A \n“Continuous Read Mode” Rese t command can be used to reset (M5 -4) before issuing normal command  \nWhile Program/Erase/Write Status Register cycle is in progress, 4READ instruction is rejected without any \nimpact on the Program/Erase/Write Status Register current cycle.  \nFigure 10-17 4 X IO Read Mode Sequence (Command EB  M5-4 ≠ (1,0) ) \nCommand 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \nEBH CS# \nSCLK \nSI(IO0) \nSO(IO1) 8  9    10  11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19    20   21   22   23  \n4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 \n5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 \nA23-16A15-8A7-0 M7-0 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 \n7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 WP#(IO2) \nHOLD#(IO3) 4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nDummy Byte1    Byte2 \n \nNote:  \n1.

The “Set Burst with Wrap”(77H) command  can either enable \nor disable the “Wrap Around”  feature for the following E7H c ommands. When “Wrap Around”  is enabled, the \ndata being accessed can be limited to either an8/16/32/64 -byte section of a 256 -byte page. The output data \nstarts at  the initial address specified in the command, once it reaches the ending boundary of the \n8/16/3 2/64-byte section, the output will wrap around the beginning  boundary automatically until CS# is pulled \nhigh to terminate the command.  \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address and then fill \nthe cach e afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple read commands. \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap”  command allows three “Wrap Bits”W6 -W4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to enable \nor disable the “Wrap Around”  operation while W6 -W5 is used to specify the length of the  wrap around section  \nwithin a page.  \n10.23  4 X IO Octal Word Read (E3h)  \nThe 4 X IO Octal Word Read (E3h) instruction is similar to the 4 X IO Read (EBh) instruction  except that the \nlower four Address bits (A0, A1, A2, A3) must e qual 0. As a result, the dummy clocks are  not required, which \nfurther reduces the instruction overhead allowing even faster random access for code  execution (XIP). The \nQuad Enable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 must be set to enable the Octal Word  Read Quad  I/O Instruction.  \n4 X IO Octal Word Read with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe 4 X IO Octal Word Read instruction can further reduce instruction overhead through setting the  \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7 -0) after the input Address bits (A23 -0). The  upper nibble of the (M7 -4) \ncontrols the length of the next Octal Word Read Quad I/O instruction through  the inclusion or exclusion of the \nfirst byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the (M3 -0) are don’t  care (“x”). However, the IO pins should \nbe high -impedance prior to the falling edge of the first data out  clock.  \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next Fast Read Quad I/O instruction (after /CS  is \nraised and then lowered) does not require the E3h instruction code, as shown in Figu re 27b. This  reduces the \ninstruction sequence by eight clocks and allows the Read address to be immediately entered  after /CS is \nasserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5 -4 do not equal to (1,0), the next  instruction (after /CS is \nraised and then  lowered) requires the first byte instruction code, thus returning to  normal operation. It is \nrecommended to input FFh on IO0 for the next instruction (8 clocks), to ensure M4  = 1 and return the device \nto normal operation.  \nFigure 10-22 4 x I/O Octal Word Read Sequence  (E3H) \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 50 of 97 \nCommand 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \nE3H CS# \nSCLK \nSI(IO0) \nSO(IO1) 8  9    10  11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19     \n4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 \n5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 \nA23-16A15-8A7-0 M7-0 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 \n7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 7 3 WP#(IO2) \nHOLD#(IO3) 4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nByte1    Byte2 \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7CS# \nSCLK  8    9    10   11     \nSI(IO0) \nSO(IO1) \nWP#(IO2) \nHOLD#(IO3) 4 0 4 0 \n5 1 5 1 \n6 2 6 2 \n7 3 7 3 4 0 4 0 \n5 1 5 1 \n6 2 6 2 \n7 3 7 3 4 0 4 0 \n5 1 5 1 \n6 2 6 2 \n7 3 7 3 4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n M7-0  Byte1    Byte2 A23-16A15-8A7-0 \n10.24  Set Read Parameters  (C0h)  \nIn QPI mode the “Set Read Parameters (C0H)” command can be used to configure the number of dummy \nclocks for “Fast Read (0BH)”, “Quad I/O Fast Read (EBH)” and “Burst Read with Wrap (0CH)” command, and \nto configure the number of bytes of “Wrap Length” for the “Burst Read with Wrap (0CH)” command.

The command is followed by a \n3-byte address (A23 -A0) and a dummy byte, each bit being latched -in during the rising edge of SCLK. Then \nthe memory content, at that address, is shifted out o n SO, each bit being shifted out, at a Max frequency fC, \nduring the falling edge of SCLK. The first byte addressed can be at any location. The address is automatically \nincremented to the next higher address after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the A9-A0 address \nreaches the last byte of the register (Byte 3FFH), it will reset to 000H, the command is completed by driving \nCS# high.  \nThe sequence of issuing RDSCUR instruction is : CS# goes low → sending RDSCUR instruction → sending \n24 bit address → 8 bit  dummy byte → Security Register data out on SO → CS# goes high.  \nAddress  A23-16 A15-12 A11-10 A9-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00H 0001  00 Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00H 0010  00 Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00H 0011  00 Byte Address  \n \nFigure 10-37 Read Security Registers  (RDSCUR) Sequence (Command 48 ) \nCommand 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n48H CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO High-Z 8  9   10  28   29   30   31 \n3 2 1 0  24-bitaddress \nMSB   \n6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Data Out1    \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 \n6 5 7 Data Out2 CS# \nSCLK \nSI \nSO \nMSB DummyByte 23   22  21\n32   33   34   35   36   37   38   39   4041   42   43   44   45   46   47\n \n \n \n \n  \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 65 of 97 10.39  Deep Power -down (DP)  \nThe Deep Power -down (DP) instruction is for setting the device on the minimizing the power consumption (to \nentering the Deep Power -down mode), the  standby current is reduced from ISB1 to ISB2). The Deep \nPower -down mode requires the Deep Power -down (DP) instruction to enter, during the Deep Power -down \nmode, the device is not active and all Write/Program/Erase instruction are ignored.  When CS# goes h igh, \nit\'s only in standby mode not deep power -down mode.  It\'s different from Standby mode.  \nThe sequence of issuing DP instruction is: CS# goes low→ sending DP instruction code→ CS# goes high.  \nOnce the DP instruction is set, all instruction will be ignore d except the Release from Deep Power -down \nmode (RDP) and Read Electronic Signature (RES) instruction. (RES instruction to allow the ID been read out). \nWhen Power - down, the deep power -down mode automatically stops, and when power -up, the device \nautomatical ly is in standby mode. For RDP instruction the CS# must go high exactly at the byte boundary (the \nlatest eighth bit of instruction code been latched -in); otherwise, the instruction will not be executed. As soon \nas Chip Select (CS#) goes high, a delay of tD P is required before entering the Deep Power -down mode and \nreducing the current to ISB2.  \nFigure 10-38 Deep Power -down (DP) Sequence (Command B9)  \nCommand  0    1    2    3     4    5    6    7     \nB9H\n CS# \nSCLK\n \nSI\n tDP \nStandby mode Deep power-down mode \nFigure 10-38a Deep Power -down (DP) Sequence ( QPI) \n \nCS# \nSCLK \nSI(IO0) \nSO(IO1) \nWP#(IO2) \nHOLD#(IO3) Command\nB9H0     1tDP\nStand-by mode Deep Power-down mode\n \n  \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 66 of 97 10.40  Release form Deep Power -Down (RDP), Read Electronic Signature (RES)  \nThe Release from Deep Power -down (RDP) instruction is terminated by driving Chip Select (CS#) High. \nWhen Chip Select (CS#) is driven high, the device is put in the Stand -by Power mode. If the device was not \npreviously in the Deep Power -down mode, the transition to the Stand -by Power mode is immediate. If the \ndevice was previously in the Deep Power -down mode, though, the transition to the Stand -by Power mode is \ndelayed by tRES2, and Chip Sel ect (CS#) must remain High for at least tRES2(max). Once in the Stand -by \nPower mode, the device waits to be selected, so that it can receive, decode and execute instructions.  \nRES instruction is for reading out the old style of 8 -bit Electronic Signature, w hose values are shown as table \nof ID Definitions.  This is not the same as RDID instruction. It is not recommended to use for new design. For \nnew design, please use RDID instruction.  Even in Deep power -down mode, the RDP and RES are also \nallowed to be exe cuted, only except the device is in progress of program/erase/write cycle; there\'s no effect \non the current program/erase/ write cycle in progress.  \nThe RES instruction is ended by CS# goes high after the ID been read out at least once.

If the device was \nnot previously in Deep Power -down mode, the device transition to standby mode is immediate.   If the \ndevice was previously in Deep Power -down mode, there \'s a delay of tRES2 to transit to standby mode, and \nCS# must remain to high at least tRES2 (max).

A resume -to-suspend latency of tPRS or \ntERS must be observed before issuing another Suspend instruction ( "Resume to Suspend Latency").  \nFigure 10-46 Resume to Read Latency  \nResume CommandCS# \n Read CommandtSE  /tBE / tPP\n \nFigure 10-46a Resume to Read Latency (QPI)  \n \nCS# \nSCLK \nSI(IO0) \nSO(IO1) \nWP#(IO2) \nHOLD#(IO3) Command\n7AH or 30H0     1\nResume previously suspended program or erase\n \n \n \n10.48  No Operation (NOP)  \nThe "No Operation" command is only able to terminate the Reset Enable  (RSTEN) command and will not \naffect any other command.  \nThe SIO[3:1] are don\'t care.  \n  \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 76 of 97 10.49  Individual Block Lock  (SBLK ) \nThe Individual Block Lock provides an alternative way to protect the memory array from adverse \nErase/Program. In order to use the Individual  Block Locks, the WPS bit in Configure  Register must be set to 1. \nIf WPS=0, the write protection will be determined by the combination of CMP, BP[ 4:0] bits in the Status \nRegisters. The Individual Block Lock bits are volatile bits. The default values after device power up or after a \nReset are 1, so the entire memory array is being protected.  \nThe SBLK instruction is for write protection a spec ified b lock (or sector) of memory, using AMAX -A16 or \n(AMAX -A12) address bits to assign a 64Kbyte block (or 4K bytes sector) to be protected as read only.  \nThe WREN (Write Enable) instruction is required before issuing SBLK instruction.  \nThe sequence of issuing SB LK instruction is: CS# goes low → send SBLK (36h) instruction→send 3 -byte \naddress assign one block (or sector) to be protected on SI pin → CS# goes high. The CS# must go high \nexactly at the byte boundary, otherwise the instruction will be rejected and not be executed.  \nFigure 10-48 Individual Block Lock(Command 36H)  \nCommand 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n36H CS# \nSCLK \nSI 8 9 29   30   31 \nMSB 2 1 0 24BitsAddress \n23   22 \n \nFigure 10-48a Individual Block Lock(QPI)  \n \nCommand\n36H  A23-16     A15-8       A7-0       \n20    16    12     8      4      0      \n21    17    13     9      5      1       \n22    18    14    10     6      2     \n23    19    15    11     7      3          CS# \nSCLK \nSI(IO0) \nSO(IO1) \nWP#(IO2) \nHOLD#(IO3)0      1      2      3      4       5      6      7       \n \n  \nP25Q64H Datasheet  \nPuya Semiconductor  Page 77 of 97 10.50  Individual Block Unlock  (SBULK ) \nThe Individual Block Lock provides an alternative way to protect the memory array from adverse \nErase/Program.

The status bit is" 1" to indicate that this block has be \nprotected, that user can read only but cannot write/program /erase this block. The status bit is "0" to indicate \nthat this block hasn\'t be protected, and user can read and write this block.  \nThe sequence of issuing RDB LOCK instruction is: CS# goes low → send RDBLOCK (3Ch) instruction → \nsend 3 -byte address to assign one block on SI pin → read block\'s protection lock status bit on SO pin → CS# \ngoes high.   \nBoth SPI (8 clocks) and QPI (2 clocks) command cycle can accept by  this instruction.
