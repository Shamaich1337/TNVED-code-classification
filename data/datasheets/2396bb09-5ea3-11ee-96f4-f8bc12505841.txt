It \nconsists of a low noise digital phase frequency detector (PFD), a precision charge pump, and a programmable reference divider. There is a  Σ-Δ based fractional interpolator to allow programmable  \nfractional -N division. The INT, FRAC, and MOD registers define  \nan overall N divider (N = (INT + (FRAC/MOD))). The RF output  \nphase is programmable for applications that  require a particular \nphase relat ionship between the output and the reference. The \nADF4156 also features cycle slip reduction circuitry , leading  \nto faster lock times without the need for modifications to the \nloop filter.  \nContr ol of all on -chip registe rs is via a simple 3 -wire inter face. \nThe device operates with a power supply ranging from 2.7 V to 3.3 V and can be powered down when not in use.  \n \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \nLOCK\nDETECT\nN-COUNTERCP\nRFCP3 RFCP2 RFCP4 RFCP1REFERENCE\nDATA\nLE32-BIT\nDATA\nREGISTERCLOCKREF INAVDD\nAGNDVDD\nVDDDGND\nRDIVSDOUT\nNDIV\nDGND CPGNDDVDD VP\nCERSET\nRFINA\nRFINBOUTPUT\nMUXMUXOUT–+\nHIGH ZPHASE\nFREQUENCY\nDETECTORADF4156\nTHIRD-ORDER\nFRACTIONAL\nINTERPOLATOR\nMODULUS\nREGFRACTION\nREGINTEGER\nREGCURRENT\nSETTING×2\nDOUBLER 5-BIT\nR-COUNTER\nCHARGE\nPUMP\n05863-001CSR/2\nDIVIDER\n \nFigure 1. \nADF4156  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

Both the normalized phase noise floor and flicker noise are modeled in ADIsimPLL.  \n6 The phase noise is measured with the EV-ADF4156SD1Z evaluation board and th e Agilent E5500 phase noise system.  \n7 fREFIN = 100 MHz, f PFD = 25 MHz, offset frequency = 5 kHz, RF OUT = 5800 MHz, N = 232, loop bandwidth = 20 kHz, I CP = 313 µA, and lowest noise mode.  \nADF4156  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

MUXOUT Schematic  INPUT SHIFT REGISTER S \nThe ADF4156 digita l section includes a 5 -bit RF R -counter,  \na 12-bit RF N -counter, a 12 -bit FRAC counter, and a 12- bit \nmodulus counter. Data is clocked into the 32- bit shift register \non each rising edge of CL OCK. The data is clocked in MSB first. \nData is transferred from the shift register  to one of five latches \non the rising edge of LE. The destination latch is determined by the state of the three control bits (C3, C2 , and C1) in the shift \nregister. These bits are the three  LSBs (DB2, DB1, and DB0 ), as \nshown in F igure 2. The truth table for these bits is shown in \nTable 6. Figure 16 shows a summary of how the latches are \nprogrammed.  \nPROGRAM MODES  \nTable 6 and Figure 16 through Figure 21 show how to set up the \nprogram modes in the ADF4156.  \nSeveral  settings in the ADF4156 are double buffered , including  \nthe modulus value, phase value, R -counter value, reference doubl er, \nreference divide -by-2, and current sett ing. This means that two \nevents must  occur before the part can use  a new value for  any of \nthe double  buffered settings . The new value must first be  latched  \ninto the device by writing to the appropriate register,  and then  a \nnew write must be performed on R egister R0. For example, after  \nthe modulus value is  updated, Register R0 must be written to in \norder  to ensure that the modulus value is loaded correctly.  \nTable 6.

E | Page 13 of 24 MOD/R REGISTER, R2  \nWith the control bits (Bits[2:0]) of Register R1  set to 010 , the \non-chip MOD/R register is programmed. Figure 19 shows the \ninput data format for programming this register.  \nNoise and Spur Mode  \nThe noise modes on t he ADF4156 are controlled by DB 30 and \nDB29 in the MOD/R register. See Figure 19 for the truth table. \nThe noise modes allow the user to optimize a design either for \nimproved spurious performance or for improved phase noise \nperformance.  \nWhen the lowest spur s etting is chosen, dither is enabled. This \nrandomizes the fractional quantization noise so that it resembles  \nwhite noise , rather than spurious noise. As a result, the part is \noptimized for improved spurious performance. This operation \nis typically  used when  the PLL closed -loop bandwidth is  wide  \nfor fast -locking applica tions. Wide  loop bandwidth is defined  as  \na loop bandwidth greater than 1/10 of the RF OUT channel step \nresolution (f RES). A wide loop filter does not attenuate the spurs \nto the same level as a narrow  loop bandwidth.  \nFor best noise performance, use the lowest noise setting option. \nAs well as disabling the dither, using the lowest noise setting  \nensures that the charge pump is operating in an optimum \nregion for  noise performance . This setting is u seful if a narrow  \nloop filter band width is available. The synthesizer ensures \nextremely low noise , and the filter attenuates the spurs. The \ntypical performance characteristics show  the trade -offs in a \ntypical WCDMA setup for various  noise and spur settings . \nCSR Enable  \nSetting this bit to 1 enables cycle slip re duction, which can \nimprove  lock times. Note that the signal at the phase frequency \ndetector ( PFD ) must have a 50% duty cycle for cycle slip \nreduction to work. The charge -pump current setting must also \nbe set to a minimum  value . See  the Fast Lock Times  section for \nmore information.  Note that CSR cannot be used if the phase \ndetector polarity is set to negative.  \nCharge -Pump Current Setting \nDB[27:24]  set the charge -pump  current  setting. These bits  \nshould be set to  the charge -pump current as indicated by the \nloop filter design (see Figure 19).  \nPrescaler (P/P + 1)  \nThe dual -modulus prescaler (P/P + 1), along with the INT, \nFRAC, and MOD counters, determ ines the overall division ratio \nfrom the RF IN to the PFD input.  Operating at CML levels, the prescaler uses  the clock from the \nRF input stage and divides it down for the counters. The prescaler  \nis based on a synchronous 4/5 core. When it is set to 4/5, th e \nmaximum RF frequency allowed is 3  GHz. Therefore, when \noperating the ADF4156 with frequencies greater than  3 GHz, \nthe prescaler  must be set to 8/9. The prescaler limits the INT \nvalue as follo ws: \nWith P = 4/5, N MIN = 23 \nWith P = 8/9, N MIN = 75 \nRDIV/2  \nSetting this bit to 1 inserts a divide -by-2 toggle flip -flop \nbetween the R -counter and PFD, which extends the maximum \nREF IN input rate.  \nReference Doubler  \nSetting DB20 to 0 feeds the REF IN signal di rectly into the 5 -bit \nRF R -counter, disabling the doubler. Setting this bit to 1 multiplies  \nthe REF IN frequency by a factor of 2 before feeding it into the 5 -bit \nR-counter. When the doubler is disabled, the REF IN falling edge \nis the active edge at the PFD input to the fractional synthesizer. When the doubler is enabled, both the rising and falling edges \nof REF\nIN become active edges at the PFD input.  \nWhen the doubler is enabled and the lowest spur mode is chosen,  \nthe in -band phase noise performance is sensi tive to the REF IN \nduty cycle. The phase noise degradation can be as much as 5 dB \nfor REF IN duty cycles that are outside a 45% to 55% range. The \nphase noise is insensitive to the REF IN duty cycle when the device  \nis in the lowest noise mode and when the doub ler is disabled.  \nThe maximum allowable  REF IN frequency when the doubler is \nenabled is 30  MHz.   \n5-Bit R -Counter  \nThe 5 -bit R -counter allows the input reference frequency \n(REF IN) to be divided down to produce the reference clock to \nthe phase frequency detecto r (PFD). Division ratios from  \n1 to 32 are allowed.  \n12- Bit Interpolator MOD Value  \nThis programmable register sets the fractional modulus , which is \nthe ratio of the PFD frequency to the channel step resolution on \nthe RF output.

Figure 20 shows the \ninput data format for programming this register.  \nCounter Reset  \nDB3  is the counter reset bit for the ADF4156. When this bit is \nset to 1, the synthesizer counters are held in reset. For normal \noperation, this bit should be 0.  \nCharge -Pump Three -State  \nWhen programmed to 1, DB4  puts the charge pump into three-\nstate mode. This bit  should be set to 0 for normal operation.  \nPower -Down  \nDB5 on the ADF4156 provides the programmable power -down \nmode. Setting this bit to 1 performs a power -down. Setting this \nbit to 0 returns the synthesizer to normal operation. While in \nsoftware power -down mode, the part retains all information in \nits registers. Only when supplies are removed are the register \ncontents lost.  \nWhen a power -down is activated, the following events occur:  \n1. The synthesizer counters are forced to their load state \nconditions.  \n2. The charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n3. The digital lock detect circuitry is reset.  \n4. The RF IN input is debiased.  \n5. The input register remains active and capable of loading \nand latching data.  Phase  Detector Polarity  \nDB6  in the ADF4156 sets the phase detector polarity. When the \nVCO characteristics are positive, this bit should be set to 1. \nWhen the characteristics  are negative, DB6  should be set to 0.  \nNote that the cycle slip red uction function cannot be used if the \nphase detector polarity is set to negative.  \nLock Detect Precision (LDP)  \nWhen DB7  is programmed to 0, the digital lock detect is set \nhigh when  the phase error on 40 consecutive phase detector \ncycles is less than 10 ns e ach. When this bit is programmed to 1, \n40 co nsecutive phase detector  cycles of less than 6  ns each must \noccur before the digital lock detect is set.  \nΣ-Δ Reset  \nFor most applications, DB14  should be programmed to 0. When  \nDB14  is programmed to 0, the Σ-Δ modu lator is reset t o its starting  \npoint,  or starting  phase word , on every write to Register R0. This  \nhas the effect of producing consistent spur levels.   \nIf it is not required that the Σ -Δ modulator be reset on each \nwrite to Register R 0, DB14 should be set to  1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDB31 DB30 DB29 DB28 DB27 DB26 DB25 DB24 DB23 DB22 DB21 DB20 DB19 DB18 DB17 DB16 DB15 DB14 DB13 DB12 DB11 DB10 DB9 DB8 DB7 DB6 DB5 DB4 DB3 DB2 DB1 DB0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 U12 0 0 0 0 0 0U11 U10 U9 U8 U7 C3(0) C2(1) C1(1)CONTROL\nBITSRESERVED RESERVED\nLDPΣ-Δ RESET\nPD\nPOLARITY\nPD\nCP THREE-\nSTATE\nCOUNTER\nRESET\nU11 LDP\n0 10ns\n1 6ns\nU10 PD POLARITY\n0 NEGATIVE\n1 POSITIVE\nU9 POWER-DOWN\n0 DISABLED\n1 ENABLEDU8CP\nTHREE-STATE\n0 DISABLED\n1 ENABLEDU7COUNTER\nRESET\n0 DISABLED\n1 ENABLED\n05863-014U12Σ-Δ RESET\n0 ENABLED\n1 DISABLED\n \nFigure 20.

E | Page 17 of 24 RF SYNTHESIZER: A WO RKED EXAMPLE  \nThe following equation governs how the synthesizer should be \nprogrammed:  \nRF OUT = [INT + (FRAC/ MOD )] × [FPFD] (3) \nwhere:  \nRF OUT is the RF frequency output.  \nINT is the integer division factor.  \nFRAC  is the fractionality.  \nMOD  is the modulus.  \nThe PF D frequency can be calculated as follows: \nFPFD = REF IN × [(1 + D) /(R × ( 1 + T))] (4) \nwhere:  \nREF IN is the reference frequency input.  \nD is the RF REF IN doubler bit.  \nT is the reference divide- by-2 bit, which is set to 0 or 1 . \nR is the RF reference division fa ctor.  \nFor example, in a GSM 1 800 system, 1.8 GHz RF frequency \noutput (RF OUT) is required, 13 MHz reference frequency input \n(REF IN) is available , and 200 kHz channel resolution (f RES) is \nrequired on the RF output.  \nMOD  = REF IN/fRES \nMOD  = 13 MHz /200 kHz = 65  \nTherefore, f rom Equation 4 , \nFPFD = [13 MHz × (1 + 0)/1] = 13 MHz  (5) \n1.8 G Hz = 13 MHz × (INT + FRAC/65)  (6) \nwhere  INT = 138 and FRAC = 30. \nMODULUS  \nThe choice of modulus (MOD) depends on the reference signal \n(REF IN) available and the channel resolution (f RES) required at \nthe RF output. For example, a GSM system with 13 MHz REF IN sets \nthe modulus to 65 , resulting in the required RF output resolution \n(fRES) of 200 kHz (13 MHz/65). With dither off, the fractional spur \ninterval depends on the modulus values ch osen. See Table 7 for \nmore information.  \nREFERENCE DOUBLER AN D REFERENCE DIVIDER  \nThe on-chip reference doubler allows the input reference signal \nto be doubled. This is useful for increasing the PFD comparison \nfrequency , which in  turn  improves the noise performance of the \nsystem. Doubling the PFD frequency usually improves noise \nperformance by 3 dB. It is important to note that the PFD cannot \noperate with frequencies greater than  32 MHz due to a limitation  \nin the speed of the Σ -Δ circuit of the N -divider.  \nThe reference divide- by-2 divides the reference signal by 2, \nresulting in a 50% duty cycle PFD frequency. This is necessary for the correct operation of the cycle slip reduction ( CSR ) \nfunction. See the Fast Lock Times  section for more information.  \n12-BIT PROGRAMMABLE MOD ULUS  \nUnlike most other fractional -N PLLs, the ADF4156  allows the user  \nto program the modulus over a 12-bit range. Therefore, several \nconfigurations of the ADF4156 are possible for an application by  \nvarying the modulus value, the reference dou bler, and the 5 -bit \nR-counter.  \nFor example , conside r an application that requires 1.75 GHz RF \nand 200 kHz channel step resolution. The system has a 13 MHz \nreference signal.  \nOne possible setup is feeding the 13 MHz directly in to the PFD \nand programming the modulus to divide by 65. This result s in \nthe requir ed 200 kHz resolution.  \nAnother possible setup is using the reference doubler to create \n26 MHz from the 13 MHz input s ignal. The  26 MHz signal is then  \nfed into the PFD , which program s the modulus to divide by 130.  \nThis  setup  also results in 200 kHz resoluti on, but  offers superior \nphase noise performance compared with  the previous setup.  \nThe programmable modulus is also useful for multi standard \napplications. If a dual -mode phone requires PDC and GSM \n1800 standards, the programmable modulus is a great benefit.  \nThe PDC requires 25 kHz channel step resolution, whereas \nGSM 1800 requires 200 kHz channel step resolution.  \nA 13 MHz reference signal c an be fed directly in to the PFD , and \nthe modulus can be  programmed to 520 when in PDC mode \n(13 MHz/520 = 25 kHz). Howev er, the modulus must  be \nreprogrammed to 65 for GSM 1800 operation (13 MHz/65  \n= 200 kHz).  \nIt is important that the PFD frequency remains constant (13  MHz) . \nThis allows the user to design one loop filter that can be used in \nboth setups without running into  stability issues. It is the ratio \nof the RF frequency to the PFD frequency that affects the loop \ndesign. By keeping this relationship constant, the same loop \nfilter can be used in both applications.  \nFAST LOCK  TIMES  WITH THE ADF4156 \nAs mentioned in the Noise and Spur Mode  section, the ADF4156 \ncan be optimized for noise performance. However, in fast -lockin g \napplications, the loop bandwidth needs to be wide ; therefore , \nthe filter does not provide much attenuation of the spurs.  \nThere are two methods of achieving a fast lock time for  the \nADF4156:  using c ycle slip reduction or using d ynamic bandwidth  \nswitching mode.  In both cases, the idea is to keep the loop band-\nwidth narrow to attenuate spurs while  obtain ing a fast lock time . \nCycle slip reduction mode is the preferred technique because  it \ndoes no t require modifications to the loop filter or optimization \nof the timeout counter values  and is therefore  easier to implement.  \nADF4156  Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 18 of 24 In most cases, this method  also provides faster lock  times than \nthe bandwidth switching mode  method. In extreme cases, where \ncycle slips do not exist in the settling transient, the bandwidth \nswitching mode can be used.  \nCycle Slip Reduction Mode  \nCycle slips occur in  integer -N/fractional -N synthesizers when \nthe loop bandwidth is narrow compared with  the PFD frequency. \nThe phase error at the PFD inputs accumulates too fast for the \nPLL to correct, and the charge pump temporarily pumps in the wrong direction. This slows down the lock time dramatically. \nThe ADF4156 contains a c ycle slip reduction circuit to extend \nthe linear range of the PFD , allowing faster lock times without \nrequiring loop filter changes.  \nWhen the ADF4156 detects  that a cycle slip is about to occ ur, it \nturns on an extra charge -pump current cell. This either outputs \na cons tant current to the loop filter  or removes a constant current \nfrom the loop filter , depending on whether the VCO tuning  \nvoltage needs to increase or decrea se to acquire the new freq uency . \nAs a result,  the linear range of the PFD is increased. Stability is \nmaintained because  the current is constant , not pulsed.  \nIf the phase error increases to a point where another cycle slip  \nis likely, the ADF4156 turns on another charge -pump cell. Th is \nprocess continues until the ADF4156 detects  that the VCO \nfrequency is beyond  the desired frequency. The extra charge -pump \ncells then begin  to turn off one by one until they are  all turned \noff and the frequency is settled.  \nUp to seven  extra charge -pump cells can be turned on. In most \napplications , this is sufficient  to eliminate cycle slips altogether, \nresulting in  much faster loc k times.  \nSetting Bit DB28  in the MOD/R r egister (R2) to 1 enables cycle \nslip reduction. A 45% to 55% duty cycle is needed on the signal \nat the PFD for CSR to operate correctly.  Note that CSR cannot \nbe used if the phase detector polarity  is set to negative ; therefore,  \na noninverting loop filter topology should be used with CSR.  \nDynamic Bandwidth Switching Mode  \nThe dynamic bandwidth switching mode involves increasing the loop filter bandwidth for a set time at the beginning of the \nlocking transient. This is a chieved by boosting the charge -pump \ncurrent from the set value in Register R2  to the maximum setting.  \nTo maintain loop stability during this period, it is necessary to \nmodif y the loop filter by adding a switch and resistor. When the \nnew frequency is programmed to the ADF4156  in this mode, three  \nevents occur  simultaneously to put the device in wideband mode : \n• A timeout counter is started.  \n• The charge -pump current is  boosted from it s set current to \nthe maximum setting . \n• The fast -lock switch  (available via MUXOUT)  is activated . \n The timeout counter in Register R4 defines the period that the \ndevice is kept in wideband mode. During wideband mode, the \nPLL acquires lock faster due to the wider loop filter bandwidth. \nStability is maintained at the op timal 45 ° setting due to the use \nof the extra resistor in the loop filter.  \nWhen the timeout counter times  out, the charge -pump curren t \nis reduced from the maximum setting to it s set current, and  the \nfast-lock swi tch is de activated. The device is then in narrow-\nband mode, and spurs are attenuated.  \nTo ensure optimum lock  time, the timeout counter should be \nset to time out when  the PLL is close to the final f requency. If \nthe switch is de activated, a spike  in the sett ling transient will be \nobserved due to charge insertion from the switch. Because  the \nPLL is in narrow -band mode, this spike can take some time to \nsettle out. This is one of the disadvantages of the bandwidth \nswitching mode compared with the  cycle slip redu ction mode.  \nFast Lock: An Example  \nIf a PLL has a reference frequenc y of 13 MHz , a fPFD of 13 MHz , \nand a required lock time of 50 µs, the PLL is set to wide bandwidth for 40 µs.  \nIf the time set for the wide bandwidth is 40 µs, then  \nFast-Lock Timer Value  = Time in Wide Bandwidth  × f\nPFD \nFast-Lock Timer Value  = 40 µs × 13 MHz = 520 \nTherefore, 520 must be loaded into Bits DB[18:7] of Register R4.  \nThe clock divider mode bits (DB[20:19]) in Register R4 must also  \nbe set to 01 to activate this mode. To activate the fast-lock switch  \non the MUXOUT pin, the MUXOUT control bits (DB[30:27]) \nin Register R0 must be set to 1100.  \nFast Lock: Loop Filter Topology  \nTo use fast -lock mode, an extra connection from the PLL to the  \nloop filter is needed. The damping resistor in the lo op filter \nmust be reduced to ¼ of its value while in wide bandwidth \nmode. This  is required because the charge -pump current is \nincreased by 16 while in wide bandwidth mode  and stability \nmust be ensured. When the ADF4156 is in fast -lock mode (that \nis, when the fast -lock switch is programmed to appear at the \nMUXOUT pin) , the MUXOUT pin is automatically shorted to \nground. The following two topologies can be used:  \n• Topology 1: Divide the damping resis tor (R1) into two \nvalues (R1 and R1A) that have a ratio of 1:3 (see Figure 22). \n• Topology 2: Connect an extra resistor (R1A) directly from \nMUXOUT, as shown in  Figure 23. The extra resistor must \nbe chosen  such that the parallel combination of an extra \nresistor and the damping resistor (R1) is reduced to ¼ of the original value of R1 (see Figure 23). \nData Sheet ADF4156\n \nRev.

Topology 2—Fast-Lock Loop Filter Topology \nSPUR MECHANISMS \nThis section describes the three spur mechanisms that arise \nwith a fractional-N synthesizer and how to minimize these \nspurs in the ADF4156. \nFractional Spurs \nThe fractional interpolator in the ADF4156  is a third-order Σ-Δ \nmodulator with a modulus (MOD) that is programmable to any \ninteger value from 2 to 4095. In low spur mode (dither enabled), the minimum allowable value of MOD is 50. The Σ-Δ modulator is clocked at the PFD reference rate (f\nPFD) that allows PLL output \nfrequencies to be synthesized at a channel step resolution of f\nPFD/MOD. \nIn low noise mode (dither off), the quantization noise from the \nΣ-Δ modulator appears as fractional spurs. The interval between spurs is f\nPFD/L, where L is the repeat length of the code sequence \nin the digital Σ-Δ modulator. For the third-order modulator used \nin the ADF4156 , the repeat length depends on the value of MOD, \nas listed in Table 7. \nTable 7. Fractional Spurs with Dither Off  \nCondition Repeat \nLength Spur Interval \nIf MOD is divisible by 2, but not 3 2 × MOD Channel step/2 \nIf MOD is divisible by 3, but not 2 3 × MOD Channel step/3 \nIf MOD is divisible by 6 6 × MOD Channel step/6 \nOtherwise MOD Channel step \n In low spur mode (dither enabled), the repeat length is extended \nto 221 cycles, regardless of the value of MOD, which makes the \nquantization error spectrum look like broadband noise. As a \nresult, the in-band phase noise at the PLL output can be degraded by as much as 10 dB. Therefore, for lowest noise, keeping dither off is a better choice, particularly when the final loop bandwidth is low enough to attenuate even the lowest frequency fractional spur.  \nInteger Boundary Spurs \nAnother mechanism for fractional spur creation is interactions \nbetween the RF VCO frequency and the reference frequency. \nWhen these frequencies are not integer related (as is the case \nwith fractional-N synthesizers), spur sidebands appear on the \nVCO output spectrum at an offset frequency that corresponds to the beat note or the difference in frequency between an \ninteger multiple of the reference and the VCO frequency.  \nThese spurs are attenuated by the loop filter and are more \nnoticeable on channels close to integer multiples of the \nreference, where the difference frequency can be inside the loop \nbandwidth, hence the name integer boundary spurs. \nReference Spurs \nReference spurs are generally not a problem in fractional-N \nsynthesizers because the reference offset is far outside the loop \nbandwidth. However, any reference feedthrough mechanism that bypasses the loop can cause a problem. One such mechanism is feedthrough of low levels of switching noise from the on-chip reference through the RF\nIN pin and back to the VCO, resulting \nin reference spur levels as high as −90 dBc. Care should be taken in the PCB layout to ensure that the VCO is well separated from the \ninput reference to avoid a possible feedthrough path on the board. \nSPUR CONSISTENCY AND FRACTIONAL SPUR \nOPTIMIZATION \nWith dither off, the fractional spur pattern due to the quantization \nnoise of the Σ-Δ modulator also depends on the phase word set as the starting point of the modulator. Setting the Σ-Δ reset bit \n(DB14 in Register R3) to 0 ensures that this starting point is used \nfor the Σ-Δ modulator on every write to Register R0. \nThe phase word can be varied to optimize the fractional and \nsubfractional spur levels on any particular frequency. Therefore, \na look-up table of phase values corresponding to each frequency \ncan be constructed for use when programming the ADF4156 . \nThe evaluation software has a sweep function to sweep the \nphase word so that the user can observe the spur levels on a \nspectrum analyzer. \nIf a look-up table is not used, keep the phase word at a constant \nvalue to ensure consistent spur levels on a particular frequency. \n \n \nADF4156  Data Sheet \n \nRev. E | Page 20 of 24 PHASE RESYNC  \nThe output of a fractional -N PLL can settle to any MOD phase \noffset with  respect to the input reference,  where MOD is the \nfractional modulus. The phase resync feature in the ADF4156 is \nused to produce a consistent output phase offset with respect to \nthe input reference. This is necessary in applications where the \noutput phase and frequency are  important, such as digital beam  \nforming. See the Phase Programmability  section for information  \nabout how to program a specific RF output phase when using \nthe phase r esync  feature . \nPhase resync is enabled by setting Bits DB[20:19 ] in Register R4 \nto 10. When phase resync is enabled, an internal timer generates  \nsync signals at intervals of t SYNC as indicated by the following \nformula:  \ntSYNC = CLK_DIV_VALUE  × MOD × tPFD \nwhere : \ntPFD is the PFD reference period.  \nCLK_DIV_VALUE  is the d ecimal value programmed in \nBit DB[18:7] of R egister R4 . This value  can be any integer in the \nrange of 1 to 4095.  \nMOD  is the modulus value programmed in Bit  DB[14:3] of \nRegister R2 . \nWhen a new frequency is programmed, the second sync pulse after the LE ris ing edge is used to resynchronize  the output \nphase to the reference. The t\nSYNC time should be programmed to \na value that is a t least as long as the wors t-case lock time. Doing \nso guarantees that the phase resync occurs after the last cycle \nslip in the PLL settling transient.  \nIn the example shown in Figure 24, the PFD reference is \n25 MHz and  the MOD  value is  125 for a 200 kHz channel \nspacing. Therefore, tSYNC is set to 400 µs by programming \nCLK_DIV_V ALUE to 80.

As this word  is swept from 0 to MOD, the RF output \nphase sweeps over a 360o/MOD range in steps of 360o/MOD.  \nLOW F REQUENCY APPLICATIONS  \nThe specification on the RF input is 0.5  GHz minimum ; however,  \nlower RF frequencies can be used if  the minimum slew rate \nspecification of 400 V/µs is met. An appropriate LVDS driver , such  \nas the FIN1001 from Fairchild Semiconductor, c an be used to \nsquare up the RF signal before it is fed back into the ADF4156 \nRF input.   \nFILTER DESIGN —ADI sim PLL  \nA filter design and analysis program is available to help implement  \nthe PLL design.

E | Page 21 of 24 INTERFACING \nThe ADF4156  has a simple SPI-compatible serial interface for \nwriting to the device. CLOCK, DATA, and LE control the data \ntransfer. When latch enable (LE) is high, the 29 bits that have been clocked into the input register on each rising edge of serial \nclock are transferred to the appropriate latch. The maximum \nallowable serial clock rate is 20 MHz. See Figure 2 for the timing \ndiagram and Table 6 for the latch truth table. \nPCB DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR CHIP SCALE \nPACKAGE \nThe lands on the lead frame chip scale package (CP-20-6) are \nrectangular. The printed circuit board pad for these lands should be \n0.1 mm longer than the package land length and 0.05 mm wider \nthan the package land width. The package land should be centered \non the pad to ensure that the solder joint size is maximized.  The bottom of the chip scale package has a central thermal pad. \nThe thermal pad on the printed circuit board should be at least \nas large as this exposed pad. On the printed circuit board, there should be a clearance of at least 0.25 mm between the thermal \npad and the inner edges of the pad pattern to ensure that shorting \nis avoided. \nThermal vias can be used on the printed circuit board thermal \npad to improve thermal performance of the package. If vias are \nused, they should be incorporated in the thermal pad on a 1.2 mm \npitch grid. The via diameter should be between 0.3 mm and 0.33 mm, and the via barrel should be plated with 1 oz of copper to plug the via. In addition, the printed circuit board \nthermal pad should be connected to AGND. \n \n \nADF4156  Data Sheet \n \nRev.
