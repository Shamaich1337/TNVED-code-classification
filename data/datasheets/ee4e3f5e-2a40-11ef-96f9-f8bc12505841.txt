The LP2980-ADJ supports an output range \nof 1.2 V to 15.0 V (new chip) and 1.23 V to 15.0 V \n(legacy chip).\nAdditionally, the LP2980-ADJ (new chip) has a 1% \noutput accuracy across load and temperature that \ncan meet the needs of low-voltage microcontrollers \n(MCUs) and processors.\nIn the new chip, wide bandwidth PSRR performance \nof greater than 70 dB at 1 kHz and 45 dB at \n1 MHz helps attenuate the switching frequency of \nan upstream DC/DC converter and minimize post \nregulator filtering.\nThe internal soft-start time and current-limit protection \nreduce inrush current during start up, thus minimizing \ninput capacitance. Standard protection features, such \nas overcurrent and overtemperature protection, are \nincluded.\nThe LP2980-ADJ is available in a 5-pin, 2.9-mm × \n1.6-mm SOT-23 (DBV) package.\nPackage Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)PACKAGE SIZE(2)\nLP2980-ADJ DBV (SOT-23, 5) 2.9 mm × 2.8 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\n(2) The package size (length × width) is a nominal value and \nincludes pins, where applicable.\n \nTemperature (°C)Dropout (mV)\n-75 -50 -25 025 50 75100 125 150050100150200250\n1mA 10mA 50mA\nDropout Voltage vs Temperature for New Chip\nIN OUT\nON/\nOFFADJLP2980-ADJ\nGNDCIN\nGND\nGNDCOUT\nGNDVIN VOUT\nR1\nR2\nGNDCFFTypical Application CircuitLP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F  – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The LP2980-ADJ has an output tolerance of 1% \nacross line, load, and temperature variation (for the new chip) and is capable of delivering 50 mA of continuous \nload current.\nThis device features integrated overcurrent protection, thermal shutdown, output enable, and internal output \npulldown and has a built-in soft-start mechanism for controlled inrush current. This device delivers excellent line \nand load transient performance. The operating ambient temperature range of the device is –40°C to +125°C.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nBandgap\nReference\n+–\nVREF = 1.2 VVIN VOUT\nGNDInternal\nControllerUVLOCurrent\nLimit\nThermal\nShutdownON/OFFR1\nOutput\nPull-down\nGNDADJ\nGNDRFCF\nR2CFF\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Output Enable\nThe ON/ OFF pin for the device is an active-high pin. The output voltage is enabled when the voltage of the \nON/OFF pin is greater than the high-level input voltage of the ON/ OFF pin and disabled when the ON/ OFF pin \nvoltage is less than the low-level input voltage of the ON/ OFF pin. If independent control of the output voltage is \nnot needed, connect the ON/ OFF pin to the input of the device.\nFor the new chip, the device has an internal pulldown circuit that activates when the device is disabled by pulling \nthe ON/ OFF pin voltage lower than the low-level input voltage of the ON/ OFF pin, to actively discharge the \noutput voltage.\n7.3.2 Dropout Voltage\nDropout voltage (V DO) is defined as the input voltage minus the output voltage (V IN – V OUT) at the rated output \ncurrent (I RATED ), where the pass transistor is fully on. I RATED  is the maximum I OUT listed in the Recommended \nOperating Conditions  table. The pass transistor is in the ohmic or triode region of operation, and acts as a \nswitch. The dropout voltage indirectly specifies a minimum input voltage greater than the nominal programmed \noutput voltage at which the output voltage is expected to stay in regulation. If the input voltage falls to less than \nthe nominal output regulation, then the output voltage falls as well.\nFor a CMOS regulator, the dropout voltage is determined by the drain-source on-state resistance (R DS(ON) ) of the \npass transistor. Therefore, if the linear regulator operates at less than the rated current, the dropout voltage for \nthat current scales accordingly. The following equation calculates the R DS(ON)  of the device.\nwww.ti.comLP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\nR DS ON = \xa0V DO\nI RATED(1)\n7.3.3 Current Limit\nThe device has an internal current limit circuit that protects the regulator during transient high-load current faults \nor shorting events. The current limit is a brick-wall scheme. In a high-load current fault, the brick-wall scheme \nlimits the output current to the current limit (I CL). ICL is listed in the Electrical Characteristics  table.\nThe output voltage is not regulated when the device is in current limit. When a current limit event occurs, the \ndevice begins to heat up because of the increase in power dissipation. When the device is in brick-wall current \nlimit, the pass transistor dissipates power [(V IN – V OUT) × I CL]. If thermal shutdown is triggered, the device \nturns off. After the device cools down, the internal thermal shutdown circuit turns the device back on. If the \noutput current fault condition continues, the device cycles between current limit and thermal shutdown. For more \ninformation on current limits, see the Know Your Limits  application note .\nFigure 7-1  shows a diagram of the current limit.\nIRATED ICL0 V\n0 mAVOUT\nVOUT(NOM)Brick-wall\nFigure 7-1. Current Limit\n7.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nFor the new chip, the device has an independent undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit that monitors the input \nvoltage, allowing a controlled and consistent turn on and off of the output voltage. To prevent the device from \nturning off if the input drops during turn on, the UVLO has hysteresis as specified in the Electrical Characteristics \ntable.LP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\n www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\n7.3.5 Output Pulldown\nThe new chip has an output pulldown circuit. The output pulldown activates in the following conditions:\n•When the device is disabled (V ON/OFF < V ON/OFF(LOW) )\n•If 1.0 V < V IN < V UVLO\nDo not rely on the output pulldown circuit for discharging a large amount of output capacitance after the input \nsupply has collapsed because reverse current can flow from the output to the input. This reverse current flow \ncan cause damage to the device. See the Reverse Current  section for more details.\n7.3.6 Thermal Shutdown\nThe device contains a thermal shutdown protection circuit to disable the device when the junction temperature \n(TJ) of the pass transistor rises to T SD(shutdown)  (typical). Thermal shutdown hysteresis assures that the device \nresets (turns on) when the temperature falls to T SD(reset)  (typical).\nThe thermal time-constant of the semiconductor die is fairly short, thus the device can cycle on and off \nwhen thermal shutdown is reached until power dissipation is reduced. Power dissipation during start up can \nbe high from large V IN – V OUT voltage drops across the device or from high inrush currents charging large \noutput capacitors. Under some conditions, the thermal shutdown protection disables the device before start-up \ncompletes.\nFor reliable operation, limit the junction temperature to the maximum listed in the Recommended Operating \nConditions  table. Operation above this maximum temperature causes the device to exceed operational \nspecifications. Although the internal protection circuitry of the device is designed to protect against thermal \noverall conditions, this circuitry is not intended to replace proper heat sinking. Continuously running the device \ninto thermal shutdown or above the maximum recommended junction temperature reduces long-term reliability.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Device Functional Mode Comparison\nTable 7-1  shows the conditions that lead to the different modes of operation. See the Electrical Characteristics \ntable for parameter values.\nTable 7-1.

In this mode, the output voltage \ntracks the input voltage. During this mode, the transient performance of the device becomes significantly \ndegraded because the pass transistor is in the ohmic or triode region, and acts as a switch. Line or load \ntransients in dropout can result in large output-voltage deviations.\nWhen the device is in a steady dropout state (defined as when the device is in dropout, V IN < V OUT(NOM)  + V DO, \ndirectly after being in a normal regulation state, but not during start up), the pass transistor is driven into the \nohmic or triode region. When the input voltage returns to a value greater than or equal to the nominal output \nvoltage plus the dropout voltage (V OUT(NOM)  + V DO), the output voltage can overshoot for a short period of time \nwhile the device pulls the pass transistor back into the linear region.\n7.4.4 Disabled\nThe output of the device can be shutdown by forcing the voltage of the ON/ OFF pin to less than the maximum \nON/OFF pin low-level input voltage (see the Electrical Characteristics  table). When disabled, the pass transistor \nis turned off, internal circuits are shutdown, and the output voltage is actively discharged to ground by an internal \ndischarge circuit from the output to ground.LP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\n www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\n8.1.1 External Feedback Resistors\nThe output voltage is set using the ADJ pin with help of the external feedback resistors, R 1 and R 2 (see Figure \n8-2), according to the following equation:\nV OUT \xa0 = \xa0V ADJ \xa0 × \xa0 1\xa0 + \xa0 R 1 \xa0 / \xa0R 2 (2)\nFor the legacy chip, use a resistor from the ADJ pin to ground with a value of 51.1 kΩ.\nFor the new chip, to ignore the ADJ pin current error term in the V OUT equation, set the feedback divider current \nto 100 times the ADJ pin current listed in the Electrical Characteristics  table. This setting provides the maximum \nfeedback divider series resistance, as shown in the following equation:\nR 1 \xa0 + \xa0R 2 \xa0 ≤ \xa0 V OUT \xa0 / \xa0 I ADJ \xa0 × \xa0100 (3)\n8.1.2 Recommended Capacitor Types\nThis section describes the recommended capacitors for both the new chip and the legacy chip.\n8.1.2.1 Recommended Capacitors for the New Chip\nThe new chip is designed to be stable using low equivalent series resistance (ESR) ceramic capacitors at \nthe input and output. Multilayer ceramic capacitors have become the industry standard for these types of \napplications and are recommended, but must be used with good judgment. Ceramic capacitors that employ \nX7R-, X5R-, and C0G-rated dielectric materials provide relatively good capacitive stability across temperature, \nwhereas the use of Y5V-rated capacitors is discouraged because of large variations in capacitance.\nRegardless of the ceramic capacitor type selected, the effective capacitance varies with operating voltage \nand temperature. Generally, expect the effective capacitance to decrease by as much as 50%. The input and \noutput capacitors listed in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table account for an effective capacitance of \napproximately 50% of the nominal value.\n8.1.2.2 Recommended Capacitors for the Legacy Chip\nThe ESR of a good-quality tantalum capacitor is almost directly centered in the middle of the stable  range of the \nESR curve (approximately 0.5 Ω–1 Ω). The temperature stability of tantalum capacitors is typically very good, \nwith a total variation of only approximately 2:1 over the temperature range of –40°C to +125°C (ESR increases \nat colder temperatures). Avoid off-brand capacitors because some poor-quality tantalum capacitors are available \nwith ESR values greater than 10 Ω, which usually causes oscillation problems. One caution regarding tantalum \ncapacitors is that if used on the input, the ESR is low enough to be destroyed by a surge current if the capacitor \nis powered up from a low impedance source (such as a battery) that has no limit on inrush current. In this case, \nuse a ceramic input capacitor that does not have this problem.\nwww.ti.comLP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\nCeramic capacitors are generally larger and more costly than tantalum capacitors for a given amount of \ncapacitance. These capacitors also have a very low ESR that is quite stable with temperature. However, the \nESR of a ceramic capacitor is typically low enough to make an LDO oscillate. A 2.2- μF ceramic demonstrated \nan ESR of approximately 15 m Ω when tested. If used as an output capacitor, this ESR can cause instability (see \nthe ESR curves in the Typical Characteristics  section). If a ceramic capacitor is used on the output of an LDO, \nplace a small resistor (approximately 1 Ω) in series with the capacitor. If used as an input capacitor, no resistor is \nneeded because there is no requirement for ESR on capacitors used on the input.\n8.1.3 Input and Output Capacitor Requirements\nFor the legacy chip, an input capacitor (C IN) ≥1 μF is required (the amount of capacitance can be increased \nwithout limit). Any good-quality tantalum or ceramic capacitor can be used. The capacitor must be located no \nmore than half an inch from the input pin and returned to a clean analog ground.\nFor the new chip, although an input capacitor is not required for stability, good analog design practice is to \nconnect a capacitor from IN to GND. This capacitor counteracts reactive input sources and improves transient \nresponse, input ripple, and PSRR. Use an input capacitor if the source impedance is more than 0.5 Ω. A higher \nvalue capacitor can be necessary if large, fast rise-time load or line transients are anticipated or if the device is \nlocated several inches from the input power source.\nDynamic performance of the device is improved with the use of an output capacitor. Use an output capacitor \nwithin the range specified in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table for stability.\n8.1.4 Feed-Forward Capacitor (C FF)\nA feed-forward capacitor (C FF) can be connected from the V OUT pin to the ADJ pin. C FF improves transient, \nnoise, and PSRR performance, but is not required for regulator stability. Recommended C FF values are listed \nin the Recommended Operating Conditions  table. A higher capacitance C FF can be used; however, the start-up \ntime increases. For a detailed description of C FF tradeoffs, see the Pros and Cons of Using a Feedforward \nCapacitor with a Low-Dropout Regulator  application note.\nCFF and R 1 form a zero in the loop gain at frequency f Z, whereas C FF, R1, and R 2 form a pole in the loop gain at \nfrequency f P. CFF zero and pole frequencies can be calculated from the following equations:\nfZ = 1 / (2 × π × C FF × R 1) (4)\nfP = 1 / (2 × π × C FF × (R 1 || R 2)) (5)\nFor the legacy chip, a feed-forward capacitor (C FF) of 7 pF is required, because this capacitor provides the lead \ncompensation necessary for loop stability. Use a temperature-stable ceramic capacitor (NPO or COG type).\nFor the new chip, a C FF ≥ 10 pF is required for stability only if the feedback divider current is less than 5 μA. The \nfollowing equation calculates the feedback divider current.\nIFB_Divider  = V OUT / (R 1 + R 2) (6)\nTo avoid start-up time increases from C FF, limit the product C FF × R 1 < 50 µs.\nFor an output voltage of 1.2 V with the ADJ pin tied to the V OUT pin, no C FF is used.\n8.1.5 Reverse Current\nExcessive reverse current can damage this device. Reverse current flows through the intrinsic body diode of the \npass transistor instead of the normal conducting channel. At high magnitudes, this current flow degrades the \nlong-term reliability of the device.\nConditions where reverse current can occur are outlined in this section, all of which can exceed the absolute \nmaximum rating of V OUT ≤ V IN + 0.3 V.\n•If the device has a large C OUT and the input supply collapses with little or no load current\n•The output is biased when the input supply is not established\n•The output is biased above the input supplyLP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\n www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\nIf reverse current flow is expected in the application, use external protection to protect the device. Reverse \ncurrent is not limited in the device, so external limiting is required if extended reverse voltage operation is \nanticipated.\nFigure 8-1  shows one approach for protecting the device.\nIN OUT\nGNDCIN\nGND\nGNDCOUT\nGNDInternal Body DiodeSchottky Diode\nFigure 8-1. Example Circuit for Reverse Current Protection Using a Schottky Diode\n8.1.6 Power Dissipation (P D)\nCircuit reliability requires consideration of the device power dissipation, location of the circuit on the printed \ncircuit board (PCB), and correct sizing of the thermal plane. The PCB area around the regulator must have few \nor no other heat-generating devices that cause added thermal stress.\nTo first-order approximation, power dissipation in the regulator depends on the input-to-output voltage difference \nand load conditions. The following equation calculates power dissipation (P D).\nPD = (V IN – V OUT) × I OUT (7)\nNote\nPower dissipation can be minimized, and therefore greater efficiency can be achieved, by correct \nselection of the system voltage rails. For the lowest power dissipation use the minimum input voltage \nrequired for correct output regulation.\nFor devices with a thermal pad, the primary heat conduction path for the device package is through the thermal \npad to the PCB. Solder the thermal pad to a copper pad area under the device. This pad area must contain an \narray of plated vias that conduct heat to additional copper planes for increased heat dissipation.\nThe maximum power dissipation determines the maximum allowable ambient temperature (T A) for the device. \nAccording to the following equation, power dissipation and junction temperature are most often related by the \njunction-to-ambient thermal resistance (R θJA) of the combined PCB and device package and the temperature of \nthe ambient air (T A).\nTJ = T A + (R θJA × P D) (8)\nThermal resistance (R θJA) is highly dependent on the heat-spreading capability built into the particular PCB \ndesign, and therefore varies according to the total copper area, copper weight, and location of the planes. \nThe junction-to-ambient thermal resistance listed in the Thermal Information  table is determined by the JEDEC \nstandard PCB and copper-spreading area, and is used as a relative measure of package thermal performance. \nAs mentioned in the An empirical analysis of the impact of board layout on LDO thermal performance  application \nnote, RθJA can be improved by 35% to 55% compared to the Thermal Information  table value with the PCB \nboard layout optimization.\n8.1.7 Estimating Junction Temperature\nThe JEDEC standard now recommends the use of psi ( Ψ) thermal metrics to estimate the junction temperatures \nof the linear regulator when in-circuit on a typical PCB board application. These metrics are not thermal \nwww.ti.comLP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\nresistance parameters and instead offer a practical and relative way to estimate junction temperature. These \npsi metrics are determined to be significantly independent of the copper area available for heat-spreading. \nThe Thermal Information  table lists the primary thermal metrics, which are the junction-to-top characterization \nparameter (ψ JT) and junction-to-board characterization parameter ( ψJB). These parameters provide two methods \nfor calculating the junction temperature (T J), as described in the following equations. Use the junction-to-top \ncharacterization parameter ( ψJT) with the temperature at the center-top of device package (T T) to calculate \nthe junction temperature. Use the junction-to-board characterization parameter ( ψJB) with the PCB surface \ntemperature 1 mm from the device package (T B) to calculate the junction temperature.\nTJ = T T + ψ JT × P D (9)\nwhere:\n•PD is the dissipated power\n•TT is the temperature at the center-top of the device package\nTJ = T B + ψ JB × P D (10)\nwhere:\n•TB is the PCB surface temperature measured 1 mm from the device package and centered on the package \nedge\nFor detailed information on the thermal metrics and how to use them, see the Semiconductor and IC Package \nThermal Metrics  application note .LP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\n www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\n8.2 Typical Application\nFigure 8-2  shows the standard usage of the LP2980-ADJ as a low-dropout regulator.\nIN OUT\nON/\nOFFADJLP2980-ADJ\nGNDCIN\nGND\nGNDCOUT\nGNDVIN VOUT\nR1\nR2\nGNDCFF\nFigure 8-2. LP2980-ADJ Typical Application\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\nFor this design, use the minimum C OUT value for stability (which can be increased without limit for improved \nstability and transient response). The ON/ OFF pin must be actively terminated. Connect this pin to V IN if the \nshutdown feature is not used. Set the output voltage using a feedback divider between the V OUT pin and the ADJ \npin. Use an optional C FF capacitor for improved transient, noise, and PSRR performance.\nFor the new chip, Table 8-1  summarizes the design requirements for Figure 8-2 .\nTable 8-1.

The output \nvoltage operating range is 1.2 V to 15 V, and is calculated using:\nV OUT \xa0 = \xa0V ADJ \xa0 × \xa0 1\xa0 + \xa0 R1/ R 2 (11)\nwhere:\n•VREF = 1.2 V (typical)\nChoose resistors R1 and R2 as suggested in the External Feedback Resistors  section.\nFigure 8-2  depicts this configuration.\nwww.ti.comLP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\n8.2.2.2 ON/OFF Input Operation\nThe LP2980-ADJ is shut off by driving the ON/OFF input low, and turned on by pulling the ON/OFF input high. \nIf this feature is not used, the ON/OFF input must be tied to V IN to keep the regulator output on at all times (the \nON/OFF input must not be left floating).\nTo ensure proper operation, the signal source used to drive the ON/OFF input must be able to swing above \nand below the specified turn-on/turn-off voltage thresholds that specify an ON or OFF state (see the Electrical \nCharacteristics  table).\nFor the legacy chip, the turn-on (and turn-off) voltage signals applied to the ON/OFF input must have a slew rate \nwhich is greater than 40 mV/μs.\nFor the new chip, there is no restriction on the slew rate of the voltage signals applied to the ON/OFF input. Both \nfast and slow ramping voltage signals can be used to drive the ON/OFF pin.\nNote\nFor the legacy chip only, the ON/OFF function does not operate correctly if a slow-moving signal is \nused to drive the ON/OFF input.LP2980-ADJ\nSNVS001F – APRIL 2000 – REVISED JULY 2023\n www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LP2980-ADJ\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nat operating temperature T J = 25°C, V IN = V OUT(NOM)  + 1.0 V or 2.5 V (whichever is greater), I OUT = 1 mA, \nON/OFF pin tied to V IN, CIN = 1.0 µF, and C OUT = 4.7 µF (unless otherwise noted)\n \nFigure 8-3.
