Thus, if the load (weight) is doubled the force required to cause sliding is also double. This is expressed \nmathematically as follows: Sliding Force = Mk x weight.\n2      These properties were run on sheet material from the same materials as the individual Bumpon products\n3        Reference test for 24 hours.

#### Description:
The 3M™ Bumpon™ Protective Product SJ5076 is a molded polyurethane shape designed for various protective applications. It features a pressure-sensitive adhesive backing that allows for easy application to surfaces. The product is characterized by its durability and resilience, making it suitable for use as feet, stops, spacers, and protectors in a wide range of applications.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Feet**: Used on the bottom of small appliances, electronic devices, cabinetry, telephones, keyboards, foot pedals, scales, clocks, speakers, dispensers, and computers to prevent slippage and protect surfaces.
- **Stops**: Acts as a buffer for cabinet doors, lids, and drawers to prevent damage from slamming.
- **Spacers**: Provides alignment for picture frames and aids in assembly for electronic and automotive applications.
- **Protectors**: Prevents damage during shipping and keeps parts from direct contact with each other, reducing the risk of scratches and scuffs.

The SJ5076 is particularly useful in environments where slamming, scratching, nicking, scuffing, marring, sliding, vibration, or noise could be problematic, making it a versatile solution for both industrial and consumer applications.
