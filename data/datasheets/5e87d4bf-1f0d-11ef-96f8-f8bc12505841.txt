HP = High-performance I/O with support for I/O voltage from 1.2V to 1.8V.\n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 7Stacked Silicon Intercon nect (SSI) Technology \nThere are many challeng es associated with creating high capacity FPGAs that Xilinx addresses with the SSI technology. \nSSI technology enables multiple super logic regions (SLRs) to  be combined on a passive interposer layer, using proven \nmanufacturing and assembly techniques from industry leaders, to create a single FPGA with more than ten thousand inter-SLR connections, providing ultra-high bandwidth connectivity with low latency and low power consumption. There are two \ntypes of SLRs used in Virtex-7 FPGAs: a logic intens ive SLR used in the Virtex-7 T devices and a DSP/block \nRAM/transceiver-rich SLR used in the Virtex-7 XT and HT  devices. SSI technology enables  the production of higher \ncapability FPGAs than traditional manu facturing methods, enabling the highest capacity and highest performance FPGAs \never created to reach production more quickly and with less ri sk than would otherwise be possible. Thousands of super long \nline (SLL) routing resources and ultra-high performance clock lin es that cross between the SLRs ensure that designs span \nseamlessly across these high-density programmable logic devices.\nCLBs, Slices, and LUTs\nSome key features of the CLB architecture include: \n\x81 Real 6-input look-up tables (LUTs)\n\x81 Memory capability within the LUT\n\x81 Register and shift register functionality\nThe LUTs in 7 series FPGAs can be configured as either one 6-input LUT (64-bit ROMs) with one output, or as two 5-input \nLUTs (32-bit ROMs) with separate outputs but common addresses or logic inputs. Each LUT output can optionally be registered in a flip-flop. Four such LUTs and their eight flip-flops as well as multiplexers and arithmetic carry logic form a \nslice, and two slices form a configurable logic block (CLB). Fo ur of the eight flip-flops per slice (one per LUT) can optionall y \nbe configured as latches.\nBetween 25–50% of all slices can also use their LUTs as distribu ted 64-bit RAM or as 32-bit shift registers (SRL32) or as two \nSRL16s. Modern synthesis tools take advantage of these hi ghly efficient logic, arithmetic, and memory features.\nClock Management\nSome of the key highlights of the clock management architecture include:\n\x81 High-speed buffers and routing for low-skew clock distribution\n\x81 Frequency synthesis and phase shifting\x81 Low-jitter clock generation and jitter filtering\nEach 7 series FPGA has up to 24 clock management tiles (C MTs), each consisting of one mixed-mode clock manager \n(MMCM) and one phase-locked loop (PLL).Table  11: Virtex-7 HT FPGA Device-Package Combinations and Maximum I/Os\nPackage(1)FLG1155 FLG1931 FLG1932\nSize (mm) 35 x 35 45 x 45 45 x 45\nBall Pitch 1.0 1.0 1.0\nDevice GTH GTZI/O\nGTH GTZI/O\nGTH GTZI/O\nHP(2)HP(2)HP(2)\nXC7VH580T 24 8 400 48 8 600\nXC7VH870T 72 16 300\nNotes: \n1.

HP = High-performance I/O with support for I/O voltage from 1.2V to 1.8V.\n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 8Mixed-Mode Clock Manager and Phase-Locked Loop\nThe MMCM and PLL share many characteristics. Both can serve as a frequency synthesizer for a wide range of frequencies \nand as a jitter filter for incoming clocks.  At the center of both co mponents is a volt age-controlled oscilla tor (VCO), which \nspeeds up and slows down depending on the input voltage it receives from the phase frequency detector (PFD). \nThere are three sets of programmable frequency dividers: D, M, and O. The pre-divider D (programmable by configuration \nand afterwards via DRP) reduces the input frequency and feeds one input of the traditional PLL phase/frequency comparator. The feedback divider M (programmable by configuration and afterwards via DRP) acts as a multiplier because it divides the VCO output frequency before feeding the other input of the phase comparator. D and M must be chosen appropriately to keep the VCO within its specified frequen cy range. The VCO has eight e qually-spaced output phases \n(0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°). Each can be selected to drive one of the output dividers (six for the PLL, O0 to O5, and seven for the MMCM, O0 to O6), each programmable by configuration to divide by any integer from 1 to 128.\nThe MMCM and PLL have three input-jitter filter options: low bandwidth, high bandwidth, or optimized mode. Low-bandwidth \nmode has the best jitter attenuation but not the smallest phase offset. High-bandwidth mode has the best phase offset, but not the best jitter attenuation. Optimized mode allows the tools to find the best setting.\nMMCM Additional Programmable Features\nThe MMCM can have a fractional counter in either the feedback path (acting as a multiplier) or in one output path. Fractional counters allow non-integer increments of \n1/8 and can thus increase frequency synt hesis capabilities by a factor of 8.\nThe MMCM can also provide fixed or dynamic phase shift in small increments that depend on the VCO frequency. At \n1600 MHz, the phase-shift timing increment is 11.2 ps.\nClock Distribution\nEach 7 series FPGA provides six different types of clo ck lines (BUFG, BUFR, BUFIO, BUFH, BUFMR, and the high-\nperformance clock) to address the different clocking requirem ents of high fanout, short propagation delay, and extremely low \nskew.\nGlobal Clock Lines\nIn each 7 series FPGA (except XC7S6 and XC7S15), 32 global cl ock lines have the highest fanout and can reach every flip-\nflop clock, clock enable, and set/reset, as well as many logic i nputs. There are 12 global clock lines within any clock region \ndriven by the horizontal clock buffers (BUFH). Each BUFH can be independently enabled/disabled , allowing for clocks to be \nturned off within a region, thereby offering fine-grain control ov er which clock regions consume power. Global clock lines can \nbe driven by global clock buffers, which can also perform glitchless clock multiplexing and clock enable functions. Global \nclocks are often driven from the CMT, which can co mpletely eliminate the basic clock distribution delay.\nRegional Clocks\nRegional clocks can drive all clock destinations in their region. A region is defined as an area that is 50 I/O and 50 CLB high  \nand half the chip wide. 7 series FPGAs have between two and tw enty-four regions. There are four regional clock tracks in \nevery region. Each regional clock buffer can be driven from any of four clock-capable input pins, and its frequency can optionally be divided by any integer from 1 to 8.\nI/O Clocks\nI/O clocks are especially fast and serve only I/O logic and se rializer/deserializer (SerDes) circuits, as described in the \nI/O Logic  section. The 7 series devices have a direct connection from the MMCM to the I/O for low-jitter, high-performance \ninterfaces.\n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 9Block RAM\nSome of the key features of the block RAM include:\n\x81 Dual-port 36 Kb block RAM with port widths of up to 72\n\x81 Programmable FIFO logic\n\x81 Built-in optional error correction circuitry\nEvery 7 series FPGA has between 5 and 1,880 dual-port block RAMs, each storing 36 Kb. Each block RAM has two \ncompletely independent ports that share nothing but the stored data.\nSynchronous Operation\nEach memory access, read or write, is controlled by the clock. All inputs, data, address, clock enables, and write enables are registered. Nothing happens without a clock. The input address is  always clocked, retaining data until the next operation. An \noptional output data pipeline register allows higher clock rates at the cost of an extra cycle of latency.\nDuring a write operation, the data output can reflect either the previously stored data, the newl y written data, or can remain \nunchanged.\nProgrammable Data Width\nEach port can be configured as 32K × 1, 16K × 2, 8K × 4, 4K × 9 (or 8), 2K × 18 (or 16), 1K × 36 (or 32), or 512 × 72 (or 64). The two ports can have different aspect ratios without any constraints.\nEach block RAM can be divided into two completely independe nt 18 Kb block RAMs that can each be configured to any \naspect ratio from 16K × 1 to 512 × 36. Everything described previously for the full 36 Kb block RAM also applies to each of the smaller 18 Kb block RAMs.\nOnly in simple dual-port (SDP) mode can data widths of  greater than 18 bits (18 Kb RAM) or 36 bits (36 Kb RAM) be \naccessed. In this mode, one port is dedicated to read operation, the other to write operation. In SDP mode, one side (read or write) can be variable, while the other is fixed to 32/36 or 64/72.\nBoth sides of the dual-port 36 Kb RAM can be of variable width.Two adjacent 36 Kb block RAMs can be configured as one cascaded 64K × 1 dual-port RAM without any additional logic.\nError Detection and Correction\nEach 64-bit-wide block RAM can generate, store, and ut ilize eight additional Hamming code bi ts and perform single-bit error \ncorrection and double-bit error detection (ECC) during the read process. The ECC logic can also be used when writing to or \nreading from external 64- to 72-bit-wide memories.\nFIFO Controller\nThe built-in FIFO controller for single-clock (synchronous) or dual-clock (asynchronous or multirate) operation increments the internal addresses and provides four handshaking flags: full,  empty, almost full, and almost empty. The almost full and \nalmost empty flags are freely programmable. Similar to the block RAM, the FIFO width and depth are programmable, but the write and read ports always have identical width.\nFirst word fall-through mode presents the first-written word on the data output even before the first read operation. After the  \nfirst word has been read, there is no difference between this mode and the standard mode.\n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 10Digital Signal Processing — DSP Slice\nSome highlights of the DSP functionality include:\n\x81 25 × 18 two\'s complement mult iplier/accumulator high-resolution (48 bit) signal processor\n\x81 Power saving pre-adder to optimize symmetrical filter applications\n\x81 Advanced features: optional pipelining, optio nal ALU, and dedicated buses for cascading\nDSP applications use many binary multipliers and accumulato rs, best implemented in dedicated DSP slices. All 7 series \nFPGAs have many dedicated, full custom, low-power DSP slic es, combining high speed with  small size while retaining \nsystem design flexibility.\nEach DSP slice fundamentally consists of a dedicated 25 × 18 bit two\'s complement multiplie r and a 48-bit accumulator, \nboth capable of operating up to 741 MHz. The multiplier ca n be dynamically bypassed, and two 48-bit inputs can feed a \nsingle-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) arithmetic unit (dual 24-bit add/subtract/accumulate or quad 12-bit add/subtract/accumulate), or a logic unit that can generate any one of ten different logic functions of the two operands.\nThe DSP includes an additional pre-adder , typically used in symmetrical filters. This pre-adder improves performance in \ndensely packed designs and reduces the DSP slice count by up to 50%. The DSP also includes a 48-bit-wide Pattern \nDetector that can be used for convergent or symmetric rounding. The pattern detector is also capable of implementing 96-bit-wide logic functions when used in conjunction with the logic unit.\nThe DSP slice provides extensive pipelining and extension capabilities that  enhance the s peed and efficiency of many \napplications beyond digital signal processing, such as wid e dynamic bus shifters, memory address generators, wide bus \nmultiplexers, and memory-mapped I/O register files. The accumulator can also be used as a synchronous up/down counter. \nInput/Output\nSome highlights of the input/output functionality include:\n\x81 High-performance SelectIO techno logy with support for 1,866 Mb/s DDR3\n\x81 High-frequency decoupling capacitors within the package for enhanced signal integrity\n\x81 Digitally Controlled Impedance that can be 3-stated for lowest power, high-speed I/O operation\nThe number of I/O pins varies depending on device and packag e size. Each I/O is configurable and can comply with a large \nnumber of I/O standards. With the exception of the supply pins  and a few dedicated configuration pins, all other package pins \nhave the same I/O capabilities, constraine d only by certain banking rules. The I/O in 7 series FPGAs are classed as high \nrange (HR) or high performance (HP). The HR I/Os offer the widest range of voltage support, from 1.2V to 3.3V. The HP I/Os \nare optimized for highest performance operation, from 1.2V to 1.8V.\nHR and HP I/O pins in 7 series FPGAs are organized in bank s, with 50 pins per bank. Each bank has one common VCCO \noutput supply, which also powers certain input buffers. Some single-ended input buffers require an internally generated or an externally applied reference voltage (V\nREF). There are two VREF pins per bank (except configuration bank 0). A single bank \ncan have only one VREF voltage value.\nXilinx 7 series FPGAs use a variety of package types to suit th e needs of the user, including small form factor wire-bond \npackages for lowest cost; conventional, high performance flip-chip packages; and bare-die  flip-chip packages that balance \nsmaller form factor with hi gh performance. In the flip-chip packages, the silicon device is  attached to the package substrate \nusing a high-performance flip-chip process. Controlled ESR discrete decoupling capacitors are mounted on the package substrate to optimize signal integrity under simultaneous switching of outputs (SSO) conditions.\n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 11I/O Electrical Characteristics\nSingle-ended outputs use a conventional CMOS push/pull output structure driving High towards VCCO or Low towards \nground, and can be put into a high-Z state. The system designer can specify the slew rate and the output strength. The input is always active but is usually ignored while the output is acti ve. Each pin can optionally have a weak pull-up or a weak pull-\ndown resistor.\nMost signal pin pairs can be configured as differential input pairs or output pairs. Differential input pin pairs can optionall y be \nterminated with a 100 \uf057 internal resistor. All 7 series devices support differential standards beyond LVDS: RSDS, BLVDS, \ndifferential SSTL, and differential HSTL.\nEach of the I/Os supports memory I/O standards, such as si ngle-ended and differential HSTL as well as single-ended SSTL \nand differential SSTL. The SSTL I/O standard can support data  rates of up to 1,866 Mb/s for DDR3 interfacing applications.\n3-State Digitally Controlled Impedance and Low Power I/O Features\nThe 3-state Digitally Controlled Impedance (T_DCI) can control the output drive impedance (series termination) or can \nprovide parallel termination of an input signal to VCCO or split (Thevenin) termination to VCCO/2. This allows users to \neliminate off-chip te rmination for signals usin g T_DCI. In addition to board space savings, the termination automatically \nturns off when in output mode or when 3-stated, saving considerable power compared to off-chip termination. The I/Os also have low power modes for IBUF and IDELAY to provide further power savings, especially when used to implement memory \ninterfaces.\nI/O Logic\nInput and Output Delay\nAll inputs and outputs can be configured as either combinatoria l or registered. Double data rate (DDR) is supported by all \ninputs and outputs. Any input and some outputs can be individually delayed by up to 32 increments of 78 ps, 52 ps, or 39 ps each. Such delays are implemented as IDELAY and ODELAY. Th e number of delay steps can be set by configuration and \ncan also be incremented or decremented while in use. \nISERDES and OSERDES\nMany applications combine high-speed, bit-serial I/O with sl ower parallel operation inside the device. This requires a \nserializer and deserializer (SerDes) inside the I/O structure. Each I/O pin possesses an 8-bit IOSERDES (ISERDES and OSERDES) capable of performing serial-to-parallel or parallel-to-serial conversions with programmable widths of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits. By cascading two IOSERDES from two adjacent pins (default from differential I/O), wider width conversions of 10 and 14 bits can also be supported. The ISERDES has  a special oversampling mode capable of asynchronous data \nrecovery for applications like a 1.25 Gb/s LVDS I/O-based SGMII interface.\nLow-Power Gigabit Transceivers\nSome highlights of the Low-Power Gigabit Transceivers include:\n\x81 High-performance transceivers capable of up to 6.6 Gb/s (GTP), 12.5 Gb/s (GTX), 13.1 Gb/s (GTH), or 28.05 Gb/s \n(GTZ) line rates depending on the family, enabling the first single device for 400G implementations.\n\x81 Low-power mode optimized for chip-to-chip interfaces.\n\x81 Advanced Transmit pre and post emphasis, receiver linea r equalization (CTLE), and decision feedback equalization \n(DFE) for long reach or backplane applications. Auto-adaptio n at receiver equalization and on-chip Eye Scan for easy \nserial link tuning.\nUltra-fast serial data transmission to optical modules, betwee n ICs on the same PCB, over the backplane, or over longer \ndistances is becoming increasingly popular and important to enable customer line cards to scale to 100 Gb/s and onwards to 400 Gb/s. It requires specialized dedicated on-chip circuitry and differential I/O capable of coping with the signal integrit y \nissues at these high data rates.\nThe transceiver count in the 7 series FPGAs ranges from up to 16 transceiver circuits in the Artix-7 family, up to 32 \ntransceiver circuits in the Kintex-7 family , and up to 96 transceiver circuits in the Virtex-7 family. Each serial transceiver i s a \ncombined transmitter and receiver . The various 7 series serial transceivers use ei ther a combination of ring oscillators and \n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 12LC tank or, in the case of the GTZ, a si ngle LC tank architecture to allow the ideal blend of flexibility and performance while  \nenabling IP portability across th e family members. The differen t 7 series family members offer different top-end data rates. \nThe GTP operates up to 6.6 Gb/s, the GTX operates up to 12.5 Gb/s, the GTH operates up to 13.1 Gb/s, and the GTZ operates up to 28.05 Gb/s. Lower data rates can be achieved using FPGA logic-based oversampling. The serial transmitter \nand receiver are independent circuits that use an advanced PL L architecture to multiply the reference frequency input by \ncertain programmable numbers up to 100 to become the bit-serial data clock. Each transceiver has a large number of user-definable features and parameters. All of these can be defin ed during device configuration, and many can also be modified \nduring operation.\nTransmitter\nThe transmitter is fundamentally a parallel-to-serial converter with a conversion ratio of 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, or 80. Additiona lly, \nthe GTZ transmitter supports up to 160 bit data widths. This a llows the designer to trade-off datapath width for timing margin \nin high-performance designs. These transmitter outputs drive the PC board with a single-channel differential output signal. TXOUTCLK is the appropriately divided serial data clock and can be used directly to register the parallel data coming from the internal logic. The incoming parallel data is fed through an optional FIFO and has additional hardware support for the 8B/10B, 64B/66B, or 64B/67B encoding schemes to provide a suffi cient number of transitions. The bit-serial output signal \ndrives two package pins with differential signals. This out put signal pair has programmable signal swing as well as \nprogrammable pre- and post-emphasis to compensate for PC board losses and other interconnect characteristics. For shorter channels, the swing can be reduced to reduce power consumption.\nReceiver\nThe receiver is fundamentally a serial-to-parallel converter, chan ging the incoming bit-serial differential signal into a paral lel \nstream of words, each 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, or 80 bits. Additionally, the GTZ receiver supports up to 160 bit data widths. This allows the FPGA designer to trade-off internal datapath width versus logic timing margin.  The receiver takes the incoming \ndifferential data stream, feeds it through programmable linear and decision feedback equalizers (to compensate for PC board and other interconnect characteristics), and uses the reference clock input to initiate clock recognition. There is no need for a separate clock line. The data pattern uses no n-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding and optionally guarantees \nsufficient data transitions by using the selected encoding scheme. Parallel data is then transferred into the FPGA logic using the RXUSRCLK clock. For short channels, the transceivers offers a special low power mode (LPM) to reduce power \nconsumption by approximately 30%.\nOut-of-Band Signaling\nThe transceivers provide out-of-band (OOB) signaling, often us ed to send low-speed signals from the transmitter to the \nreceiver while high-speed serial data tran smission is not active. This is typically done when the link is  in a powered-down \nstate or has not yet b een initialized. This benefits PCI Expr ess and SATA/SAS applications.\nIntegrated Interface Bloc ks for PCI Express Designs \nHighlights of the integrated blocks for PCI Express include:\n\x81 Compliant to the PCI Express Base Specification 2.1 or 3.0 (depending of family) with Endpoint and Root Port \ncapability \n\x81 Supports Gen1 (2.5 Gb/s), Gen2 (5 Gb/s), and Gen3 (8 Gb/s) depending on device family\n\x81 Advanced configuration options, Adva nced Error Reporting ( AER), and End-to-End CRC (ECRC) Adva nced Error \nReporting and ECRC features\n\x81 Multiple-function and single root I/O virtualization (SR-IO V) support enabled through soft-logic wrappers or embedded \nin the integrated block depending on family\nAll Artix-7, Kintex-7, and Virtex-7 devices include at leas t one integrated block for PCI Express technology that can be \nconfigured as an Endpoint or Root Port, compliant to the PCI Express Base Specification Revision 2.1 or 3.0. The Root Port can be used to build the basis for a compatible Root Complex, to allow custom FPGA-to-FPGA communication via the PCI Express protocol, and to attach ASSP Endpoint device s, such as Ethernet C ontrollers or Fibre Chann el HBAs, to the FPGA.\nThis block is highly configurable to system design requirements and can operate 1, 2, 4, or 8 lanes at the 2.5 Gb/s, 5.0 Gb/s, \nand 8.0 Gb/s data rates. For high-performance applications, adv anced buffering techniques of the block offer a flexible \n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 13maximum payload size of up to 1,024 bytes. The integrated block interfaces to the integrated high-speed transceivers for \nserial connectivity and to block RAMs for data buffering. Comb ined, these elements implement the Physical Layer, Data Link \nLayer, and Transaction Layer of the PCI Express protocol.\nXilinx provides a light-weight, configur able, easy-to-use LogiCORE™ IP wrapper t hat ties the various building blocks (the \nintegrated block for PCI Express, the transceivers, block RAM,  and clocking resources) into an Endpoint or Root Port \nsolution. The system designer has control over many configurable parameters: lane width, maximum payload size, FPGA logic interface speeds, reference clock frequency, and base address register decoding and filtering.\nXilinx offers two wrappers for the integr ated block: AXI4-Stream a nd AXI4 (memory mapp ed). Note that legacy TRN/Local \nLink is not available in 7 series devices for the integrated block for PCI Express. AXI4-Stream is designed for existing \ncustomers of the integrated block and enables easy migration to AXI4-Stream from TRN. AXI4 (memory mapped) is designed for Xilinx Platform Studio/EDK design flow and MicroBlaze™ pr ocessor based designs.\nMore information and documentation on solutions for PCI Express designs can be found at: \nhttp://www.xilinx.com/products/t echnology/pci-express.html\n.\nConfiguration\nThere are many advanced configuration features, including:\n\x81 High-speed SPI and BPI (par allel NOR) configuration\n\x81 Built-in MultiBoot and safe-update capability\n\x81 256-bit AES encryption with HMAC/SHA-256 authentication\n\x81 Built-in SEU detection and correction\x81 Partial reconfiguration\nXilinx 7 series FPGAs store their customiz ed configuration in SRAM-type intern al latches. There are up to 450 Mb \nconfiguration bits, depending on device size and user-design im plementation options. The configuration storage is volatile \nand must be reloaded when ever the FPGA is powered up. Th is storage can also be reloa ded at any time by pulling the \nPROGRAM_B pin Low. Several methods and data formats for load ing configuration are available, determined by the three \nmode pins.\nThe SPI interface (x1, x2, and x4 modes) and the BPI interface (parallel-NOR x8 and x16) are two common methods used \nfor configuring the FPGA. Users can directly connect an SPI or BPI flash to the FPGA, and the FPGA\'s internal configuration \nlogic reads the bitstream out of the flash and configures itse lf. The FPGA automatically detects the bus width on the fly, \neliminating the need for any external controls or switches. Bus widths supported are x1, x2, and x4 for SPI, and x8 and x16 for BPI. The larger bus widths increase configuration speed and reduce the amount of time it takes for the FPGA to start up after power-on. Some configuration options such as BPI are not supported in all device-package combinations. Refer to UG470\n, 7 Series FPGAs Configuration User Guide for details.\nIn master mode, the FPGA can drive the configuration clock from an internally generated clock, or for higher speed \nconfiguration, the FPGA can use an external configuration clo ck source. This allows high-speed configuration with the ease \nof use characteristic of master mode. Slave modes up to 32 bi ts wide are also supported by the FPGA that are especially \nuseful for processor-driven configuration. \nThe FPGA has the ability to reconfigure it self with a different ima ge using SPI or BPI flash, eliminating the need for an \nexternal controller. The FPGA can reload its original design in  case there are any errors in the data transmission, ensuring \nan operational FPGA at the end of the process. This is espec ially useful for updates to a design after the end product has \nbeen shipped. Customers can ship their products with an early version of the design, thus getting their products to market \nfaster. This feature allows customers to keep their end users current with the most up-to-date designs while the product is already in the field.\nThe dynamic reconfiguration port (DRP) gi ves the system designer easy access to the configuration and st atus registers of \nthe MMCM, PLL, XADC, transceivers, and integrated block for PCI Express. The DRP behaves like a set of memory-mapped registers, accessing and modifying block-specific configuration bits as well as status and control registers.\n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 14Encryption, Readback, and Partial Reconfiguration\nIn all 7 series FPGAs (except XC7S6 and XC7S15), the FPGA bitstream, which contains sensitive customer IP, can be \nprotected with 256-bit AES encryp tion and HMAC/SHA-256 au thentication to prevent unaut horized copying of  the design. \nThe FPGA performs decryption on the fly during configuration using an internally stored 256-bit key. This key can reside in battery-backed RAM or in nonvolatile eFUSE bits.\nMost configuration data can be read back without affecting the system\'s op eration. Typically, configuration is an \nall-or-nothing operat ion, but Xilinx 7 series FPGAs support partial reconfiguration.  This is an extremely powerful and flexible \nfeature that allows the user to change portions of the FPGA while other portions remain static. Users can time-slice these portions to fit more IP into smaller devices, saving co st and power. Where applicable in certain designs, partial \nreconfiguration can gr eatly improve the versatility of the FPGA.\nXADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)\nHighlights of the XADC architecture include:\n\x81 Dual 12-bit 1 MSPS analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)\n\x81 Up to 17 flexible and user-configurable analog inputs \x81 On-chip or external reference option\n\x81 On-chip temperature (±4°C max error) and power supply (±1% max error) sensors\n\x81 Continuous JTAG access to ADC measurements\nAll Xilinx 7 series FPGAs (except XC7S6 and XC7S15) integr ate a new flexible analog interface called XADC. When \ncombined with th e programmable logic capability of the 7 series FPGA s, the XADC can address a broad range of data \nacquisition and monitoring requirements. For more information, go to: http://www.xilinx.com/ams\n.\nThe XADC contains two 12-bit 1 MSPS ADCs with separate track and hold amplifiers, an on-chip analog multiplexer (up to \n17 external analog input channels supported), and on-chip therma l and supply sensors. The two ADCs can be configured to \nsimultaneously sample two external-input analog channels. T he track and hold amplifiers support a range of analog input \nsignal types, including unipolar, bipolar, and differential. T he analog inputs can support signal bandwidths of at least \n500 KHz at sample rates of 1MSPS. It is possible to support higher  analog bandwidths using ex ternal analog multiplexer \nmode with the dedicated analog input (see UG480 , 7 Series FPGAs and Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC XADC Dual \n12-Bit 1 MSPS Analog-to-Digit al Converter User Guide) .\nThe XADC optionally uses an on-chip refe rence circuit (±1%), thereby eliminat ing the need for any external active \ncomponents for basic on-chip monitoring of temperature and power  supply rails. To achieve the full 12-bit performance of the \nADCs, an external 1.25V reference IC is recommended. \nIf the XADC is not instantiated in a design, then by default it di gitizes the output of all on-chip sensors. The most recent \nmeasurement results (together with maximum and minimum readings) are stored in dedicated registers for access at any time via the JTAG interface. User-defined alarm threshol ds can automatically indicate over-temperature events and \nunacceptable power supply variation. A us er-specified limit (for example, 100°C) can be used to initiate an automatic \npowerdown.\n7 Series FPGAs Data Sheet: Overview\nDS180 (v2.6.1) S eptember 8, 2020 www.xilinx.com\nProduct Specification 157 Series FPGA Ordering Information\nTable 12  shows the speed and temperature grades av ailable in the different device families.
