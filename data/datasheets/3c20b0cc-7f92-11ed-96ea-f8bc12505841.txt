The A port \nis designed to track V CCA. VCCA accepts any supply \nvoltage from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The B port is designed \nto track V CCB. VCCB accepts any supply voltage from \n1.65 V to 5.5 V. This allows for universal low-voltage \nbidirectional translation between any of the 1.8-V, 2.5-\nV, 3.3-V, and 5.5-V voltage nodes.\nThe SN74LVC8T245  is designed for asynchronous \ncommunication between two data buses. The logic \nlevels of the direction-control (DIR) input and the \noutput-enable ( OE) input activate either the B-port \noutputs or the A-port outputs or place both output \nports into the high-impedance mode. The device \ntransmits data from the A bus to the B bus when the \nB-port outputs are activated, and from the B bus to \nthe A bus when the A-port outputs are activated. The \ninput circuitry on both A and B ports is always active \nand must have a logic HIGH or LOW level applied to \nprevent excess I CC and I CCZ.\nThis device is fully specified for partial-power-down \napplications using I off. The I off circuitry disables \nthe outputs, preventing damaging current backflow \nthrough the device when it is powered down. The V CC \nisolation feature ensures that if either V CC input is \nat GND, all outputs are in the high-impedance state. \nTo ensure the high-impedance state during power up \nor power down, OE should be tied to V CC through \na pullup resistor; the minimum value of the resistor \nis determined by the current-sinking capability of the \ndriver.\nThe SN74LVC8T245  is designed so that the control \npins (DIR and OE) are supplied by V CCA.\nPackage Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nSN74LVC8T245DBV (SSOP, 24) 8.20 mm × 5.30 mm\nDBQ (SSOP, 24) 8.65 mm × 3.90 mm\nPW (TSSOP, 24) 7.80 mm × 4.40 mm\nDGV (TVSOP, 24) 5.00 mm × 4.40 mm\nRHL (VQFN, 24) 5.50 mm × 3.50 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.SN74LVC8T245\nSCES584C  – JUNE 2005 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Pin Ax and direction control pin are support by V CCA and pin Bx \nis support by V CCB. The A port is able to accept I/O voltages ranging from 1.65 V to 5.5 V, while the B port can \naccept I/O voltages from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The high on DIR allows data transmission from A to B and a low on \nDIR allows data transmission from B to A. For voltage level translation below 1.65 V, see TI AXC products.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nDIR\nOE\nA1\nB1\nTo Seven Other Channels2\n322\n21\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Fully Configurable Dual-Rail Design Allows Each Port to Operate Over the Full 1.65-V to 5.5-V \nPower-Supply Range\nBoth V CCA and V CCB can be supplied at any voltage between 1.65 V and 5.5 V making the device suitable for \ntranslating between any of the voltage nodes (1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V, and 5 V).\n8.3.2 Ioff Supports Partial-Power-Down Mode Operation\nIoff prevents backflow current by disabling I/O output circuits when device is in partial-power-down mode.The \ninputs and outputs for this device enter a high-impedance state when the device is powered down, inhibiting \ncurrent backflow into the device. The maximum leakage into or out of any input or output pin on the device is \nspecified by I off in the Electrical Characteristics.\n8.3.3 Balanced High-Drive CMOS Push-Pull Outputs\nA balanced output allows the device to sink and source similar currents. The high drive capability of this device \ncreates fast edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing. \nAdditionally, the outputs of this device are capable of driving larger currents than the device can sustain without \nbeing damaged. Two outputs can be connected together for 2X stronger output drive strength. The electrical and \nthermal limits defined in the Absolute Maximum Ratings must be followed at all times.\n8.3.4 Vcc Isolation\nThe I/O\'s of both ports will enter a high-impedance state when either of the supplies are at GND, while the other \nsupply is still connected to the device. The maximum leakage into or out of any input or output pin on the device \nis specified by I off in the Electrical Characteristics .SN74LVC8T245\nSCES584C – JUNE 2005 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\n www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC8T245\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe SN74LVC8T245  is voltage level translator that can operate from 1.65 V to 5.5 V (V CCA and V CCB). The \nsignal translation between 1.65 V and 5.5 V requires direction control and output enable control. When OE is low \nand DIR is high, data transmission is from A to B. When OE is low and DIR is low, data transmission is from B to \nA. When OE is high, both output ports will be high-impedance. For voltage level translation below 1.65V, see TI \nAXC products.\nTable 8-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe SN74LVC8T245  device can be used in level-translation applications for interfacing devices or systems \noperating at different interface voltages with one another. The maximum output current can be up to 32 mA when \ndevice is powered by 5 V. It is recommended to tie all unused I/Os to GND. The device should not have any \nfloating I/Os when changing translation direction.\n9.2 Typical Application\nSN74LVC8T245OEDIR\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA41.8V \nControllerVCCA VCCB\nB1\nB2\nB3\nB45V \nSystem1.8V\n0.1 \x1dF 0.1 \x1dF 1 µF5V\nGND GND GNDData Data\nA5\nA6\nA7\nA8B5\nB6\nB7\nB8\nFigure 9-1.

Design Parameters\nPARAMETERS VALUES\nInput voltage range 1.65 V to 5.5 V\nOutput voltage 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nTo begin the design process, determine the following:\n•Input voltage range\n–Use the supply voltage of the device that is driving the SN74LVC8T245  device to determine the input \nvoltage range. For a valid logic high, the value must exceed the V IH of the input port. For a valid logic low, \nthe value must be less than the V IL of the input port.\n•Output voltage range\n–Use the supply voltage of the device that the SN74LVC8T245  device is driving to determine the output \nvoltage range.\n9.2.3 Application Curve\nTime (200 ns/div)Output (5 V)\nInput (1.8 V)Voltage (V)\nFigure 9-2. Translation Up (1.8 V to 5 V) at 2.5 MHz\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe SN74LVC8T245  device uses two separate configurable power-supply rails, V CCA and V CCB. VCCA accepts \nany supply voltage from 1.65 V to 5.5 V and V CCB accepts any supply voltage from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The A port \nand B port are designed to track V CCA and V CCB respectively allowing for low-voltage bidirectional translation \nbetween any of the 1.8-V, 2.5 -V, 3.3-V and 5-V voltage nodes. The recommendation is to first power-up the \ninput supply rail to help avoid internal floating while the output supply rail ramps up. However, both power-supply \nrails can be ramped up simultaneously.\nwww.ti.comSN74LVC8T245\nSCES584C – JUNE 2005 – REVISED DECEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: SN74LVC8T245\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo ensure reliability of the device, following common printed-circuit board layout guidelines is recommended.\n•Bypass capacitors should be used on power supplies.\n•Short trace lengths should be used to avoid excessive loading.\n•Placing pads on the signal paths for loading capacitors or pullup resistors helps adjust rise and fall times of \nsignals depending on the system requirements.\n11.2 Layout Example\nFrom \nController1\n2\n3\n424\nB1 A2DIR\nOEVCC\nB\nA1LEGEND\nVIA to Power Plane\nVIA to GND Plane (Inner Layer)Polygonal Copper Pour\nFrom \nController23\n22\n21Bypass CapacitorVCC\nA\n5\n6\n7\n1220\nGN\nDGNDA4\nB4A3 B2\nB3\nA519\n18\n13VCC\nAVCC\nB\nBypass Capacitor\nFrom \nControllerTo \nSystem\nTo \nSystem\nSN74LVC8T245-Q1VCC\nA\nKeep OE high until V CCA \nand  V CCB  are powered upVCC\nB\nFrom \nController\nFrom \nControllerTo \nSystem\nTo \nSystem\n8\n9\n1017\nA7\nB7A6 B5\nB6\nA816\n15From \nControllerTo \nSystem\nFrom \nController\nFrom \nControllerTo \nSystem\nTo \nSystem\n11GND B8 14To \nSystem\nFigure 11-1.
