The devices , except the AD5693 , \ninclude an enabled by default inter nal 2.5 V reference, offering  \n2 ppm/°C drift . The output span can be programmed to be 0 V  to \nVREF or 0 V to 2 × V REF. All devices operate from a single 2.7 V  to \n5.5 V supply and  are guaranteed monotonic by design.  The \ndevices are available in a 2 .00 mm × 2 .00 mm, 8 -lead LFCSP or \na 10-lead MSOP .  \nThe internal power -on reset circuit ensures  that the DAC register \nis written to zero  scale  at power -up while the internal output \nbuffer is configured in normal mode. The AD5693R /AD5692R / \nAD5691R /AD5693 contain a power -down  mode  that reduces the \ncurrent consumption of the device to 2 µA  (maximum) at 5 V and \nprovides software selectable output loads.   \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 use an I2C \ninterface. Some  device  options  also include  an asynchronous \nRESET  pin and a V LOGIC  pin, allowing 1.8 V compatibility .

D | Page 18 of 26 TERMINOLOGY  \nRelative Accuracy or Integral Nonlinearity (INL)  \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity is a \nmeas urement of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a \nstraight line passing  through the endpoints of the DAC transfer \nfunction. For typical INL vs. code plot s, see Figure 9, Figure 10, \nand Figure 11. \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL)  \nDifferential nonlinearity is the difference between the measured change and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB maximum ensures \nmonotonicity. This DAC is g uaranteed monotonic by design. For \ntypical DNL vs. code plot s, see Figure 12, Figure 13, and Figure 14. \nZero  Code Error  \nZero  code  error is a measurement of the output error when zero \ncode (0x0000) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the output is 0 V . The zero  code error is always positive in the AD5693R / \nAD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 because the output of the DAC \ncannot go below 0  V due to a combination of the offset errors in \nthe DAC and the output amplifier. Zero  code error is expressed \nin  m V.  For p lots of zero code error , see in  Figure 22 and Figure 25.  \nFull -Scale Error  \nFull-scale error is a measurement of the output  error when \nfull-scale code (0xFFFF) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally,  \nthe output is  V\nREF − 1 LSB or |2  × VREF| − 1 LSB. Full- scale error is \nexpressed  in percent of full -scale range. For p lots of full -scale error \nvs. temperature, see Figure 21 and Figure 24. \nGain Error  \nGain error is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the \ndeviation  in slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from the \nideal expressed as % of FSR.  \nZero  Code Error Drift  \nZero code error drift  is a measurement of the change in zero  \ncode error with  a change in temperature. It is expressed in µV/°C.  \nGain Temperature Coefficient  \nGain temperature coefficient is a measurement of the change in gain  \nerror with changes in temperature. It is expressed in ppm of FSR/°C.  \nOffset Error  \nOffset error is a meas ure of the difference between V OUT (actual) \nand V OUT (ideal) expressed in mV in the linear region of the \ntransfer  function. Offset error is measured on the AD5693R  with \nCode 512 loaded in the DAC register  (Code 256 for the AD5692R  \nand Code 128 for the AD5693R /AD5693) . It can be negative or \npositive.  \nDC P ower Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)  \nPSRR  indicates how the output of the DAC is affected by changes \nin the supply voltage. PSRR is the ratio of the change in V OUT to \na change in V DD for full -scale output of the DAC. It is measured \nin mV/V . V REF is held at 2 V , and V DD is varied by ±10%.  \n Output Voltage Settling Time  \nThis is the amount of time it takes for the output of a DAC to settle to a specified level for a ¼ to ¾ full- scale input change.  \nDigital -to-Analog Glitch Impulse  \nDigital -to-analog glitc h impulse is the impulse injected into the \nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes state. It is normally specified as the area of the glitch in nV -sec, \nand is measured when the digital input code is changed by 1 LSB at the major carry  transition (0x7FFF to 0x8000)  \nDigital Feedthrough  \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into the analog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the DAC, but is measured when the DAC output is not updated. It is specified in nV -sec, and measured with a full -scale code change \non the data bus, that is, from all 0s to all 1s and vice versa. \nNoise Spectral Density  \nNoise spectral density  is a measurement of the internally \ngenerated random noise. Random noise is characterized as a \nspectr al density (nV/√Hz). It is measured by loading the DAC to  \nmidscale and measuring noise at the output. It is measured in nV/√Hz. For p lots of n oise spectral density, see Figure 29, \nFigure 32, and Figure 33. The noise spectral density for the \nreference is shown in Figure 28 and Figure 31. \nMultiplying Bandwidth  \nThe amplifiers within the DAC have a finite bandwidth. The \nmultiplying bandwidth is a measure of these finite bandwidths . A \nsine w ave on the reference (with full -scale code loaded to the DAC ) \nappears on the output. The multiplying bandwidth is the frequency at which the output amplitude falls to 3 dB below the input.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)  \nTHD is the difference between an id eal sine wave and its attenuated  \nversion using the DAC. The sine wave is used as the reference \nfor the DAC, and THD is a measurement of the harmonics \npresent on the DAC output. It is measured in dB.  \nVoltage Reference T emperature Coefficient (TC)  \nVoltage re ference TC is a measure of the change in the reference \noutput voltage with a change in temperature. The reference TC \nis calculated using the box method, which defines the TC as the maximum change in the reference output over a given tempera -\nture range  expr essed in ppm/°C as follows:  \n610×\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\n×−=TempRange VV VTC\nREFnomREFmin REFmax \nwhere:  \nVREFmax  is the maximum reference output measured over the \ntotal temperature range.  \nVREFmin  is the minimum reference output measured over the total \ntemperature range.  \nVREFnom  is the nominal reference output voltage, 2.5 V .  \nTempRange  is the specified temperature range, − 40°C to +105°C.  \nData Sheet  AD5693R/AD5692R/AD5691R/AD5693  \n \nRev. D | Page 19 of 26 THEORY OF OPERATION \nDIGITAL -TO-ANALOG CONVERTER  \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 are single 16 -bit, \n14-bit, and 12-bit, serial input, voltage output DACs with a 2.5 V \ninternal reference. The devices operate from supply voltages of 2.7  V \nto 5.5 V .  Data is written to the  AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R / \nAD5693 in a 24-bit word format via an I2C serial interface.  \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 incorporate a \npower -on reset circuit that  ensures  that the DAC output powers up \nto zero scale . The devices also have a software power -down mode \nthat reduces the current consumption to 2 µA maximum. \nTRANSFER FUNCTION \nThe internal reference is on by default. T he input codin g to the \nDAC is straight binary. T he ideal output voltage is given by  the \nfollowing equations:  \nFor the AD5693R /AD5693,  \nVOUT(D) = Gain  × VREF × \n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\n536,65D \nFor the AD5692R , \nVOUT(D) = Gain  × VREF × \n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\n384,16D \nFor the AD5691R , \nVOUT(D) = Gain  × VREF × \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\uf8ee\n4096D  \nwhere:  \nD is the decimal equivalent of the binary code tha t is loaded to \nthe DAC register.  \nGain is the gain of the output amplifier  and it  is set to ×1  by \ndefault . The gain  can also be set to ×2 using the gain bit in the \ncontrol regis ter. \nDAC ARCHITECTURE  \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 implement a \nsegmented string DAC architecture with an internal output buffer. \nFigure 45 shows the internal block diagram . \nINPUT\nREGISTERDAC\nREGISTER2.5V\nREF\nRESISTOR\nSTRINGREF (+)\nREF (–)\nGNDVOUTVREF\n12077-045 \nFigure 45.

Simplified  Resistor String Structure  \nInternal Reference  \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R  on-chip reference is on at \npower -up but can be disabled via a write to the control r egister. \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R  each have a 2.5 V , 2  ppm/°C  \nreference , giving a full- scale output of 2.5 V or 5 V, depend ing \non the state of the gain bit .  \nThe internal reference is available at the V REF pin. It is internally \nbuffered and capable of driving external loa ds of up to 5  mA.   \nExternal Reference \nThe V REF pin is an input pin in the AD5693. The V REF pin can also \nbe con figured as an input pin on the AD5693R /AD5692R / \nAD5691R , allowing the  use of an external reference if the \napplication requires it.  \nIn the AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R , the default condition of \nthe on -chip reference is on at power -up. Before connecting an \nexternal reference to the pin, disable the internal reference by \nwriting to the REF  bit (Bit DB12 ) in th e control register. \nOutput Buffer  \nThe output buffer is designed as an input/output rail-to-rail \nbuffer , which gives a maximum  output voltage range of up to \nVDD. The gain  bit sets the segmented string DAC  gain to × 1 or \n×2, as shown in Table 14. \nThe output buffer voltage is determined by V REF, the gain bit, \nand the offset and gain errors . \nThe output buffer can drive  a 10 nF capacitance with a 2 kΩ \nresistor in parallel, as shown in Figure 39 and Figure 42. If  \na higher capacitance load is required, use the snubber method \nor a shunt resistor to isolate the load from the output amplifier. The slew rate is 0.7 V/µs with a ¼ to ¾ scale settling time of 5 µs.  \n \nAD5693R/AD5692R/AD5691R/AD5693  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 20 of 26 SERIAL INTERFACE  \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 have 2 -wire, I2C-\ncompatible serial interfaces. These devices can be connected to \nan I2C bus as a slave device, under the control of a master \ndevice. See Figure 3 for a timing diagram of a typical write \nsequence.  \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 support standard \n(100 kHz) and fast (400 kHz) data transfer modes. Support is \nnot provided for 10 -bit addressing and general call addressing.  \nI2C SERIAL  DATA INTERFACE  \nThe 2 -wire serial bus protocol operates as follows:  \n1. The master initiates data transfer by establishing a start condition when a high- to-low transition on the SDA line \noccurs while SCL is high. The following byte is the address \nbyte, which consists of the 7 -bit slave address. The slave \naddress corresponding to the transmitted address responds by pulling SDA low during the 9th clock pulse (this is called  the acknowledge (ACK) bit). At this stage, all other \ndevices on the bus remain idle while the selected de vice \nwaits for data to be written to, or read from, its shift register.  \n2. Data is transmitted over the serial bus in sequences of nine \nclock pulses (eight data bits followed by an acknowledge \nbit). The transitions on the SDA line must occur during the low p eriod of SCL and remain stable during the high \nperiod of SCL.  \n3. When all data bits have been read or written, a stop condition is established. In write mode, the master pulls the SDA line high during the 10 th clock pulse to establish a \nstop condition. In re ad mode, the master issues a no \nacknowledge for the ninth  clock pulse (that is, the SDA line \nremains high). The master then brin gs the SDA line low \nbefore the 10th clock p ulse, and then high during the 10th \nclock pulse to establish a stop condition.  I2C ADDRESS  \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 have a 7 -bit slave \naddress. The five MSBs are 10011. The second last bit set by the \nstate of the A0 address pin and the LSB  is 0. The ability  to make \nhardwired changes to A0 lets  the user have two of these devices \non one bus, as outlined in Table 11 . Additionally , the pin can be \nupdated before start ing the transmission, allowing multiple \ndevices in the same bus by connecting the pin to a GPIO or a \nmultiplexe r. \nTable 11. Device Address Selection  \nA0 Pin Connection  A0 I2C Address \nGND  0 1001100  \nVLOGIC (VDD on LFCSP P ackage)  1 1001110  \n \nWRITE OPERATION  \nWhen writing to the AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693, \nthe user must begin with a start condition  followed by an address  \nbyte ( R/W = 0), after which the DAC acknowledges that it is pre -\npared  to receive data by pulling SDA low , as shown in Figure 47. \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 require  a \ncommand byte that controls various DAC functions  (see Table 12) \nand two bytes of data for the DAC . All these data bytes are \nacknowledged by the AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693. A \nstop condition follows.

Reset Bit  \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 control register \ncontains a software r eset bit that resets the DAC to zero -scale and \nresets the input, DAC , and control registers t o their default values. \nA software reset is initiated by setting the RESET bit in the \ncontrol register to 1.

The LDAC  pin transfers data from the input register to \nthe DAC register , and the output is updated.  \nSynchronous  DAC Updat e  \nIf the LDAC  pin is held low while the input register is written, \nthe DAC register, input register , and output are updated o n the \nlast SCL falling edge before the ACK bit , as shown in  Figure 4. \nAsynchronous  DAC Update  \nLDAC  is held high while data is transmitted  to the device . The \nDAC output is  updated by taking LDAC  low after  the stop \ncondition has been generated.  The output DAC is update d on \nthe falling edge of the LDAC  pin. If LDAC  is pulsed while the \ndevice  is accessed , the pulse is ignored.  \nHARDWARE  RESET  \nRESET  is an active low signal that resets the DAC output to zero -\nscale and sets the input, DAC , and control registers to their \ndefault values. It is necessary to keep RESET  low for 75 ns to \ncomplete the operation. When the RESET  signal is returned high, \nthe outpu t remains at zero  scale until a new value is programmed. \nWhile t he RESET  pin is low, the AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R / \nAD5693 ignore any new command .

D | Page 24 of 26 RECOMMENDED REGULATO R \nThe AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 use a 5 V (V DD) \nsupply as well as a digital logic supply (V LOGIC ).  \nThe analog and dig ital supplies required for the AD5693R / \nAD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 can be generated using Analog \nDevices, Inc., low dropout (LDO) regulators such as the ADP7118 \nand the ADP162, respectively, for analog and digital supplies.  \nLAYOUT GUIDELINES  \nIn any circuit where accuracy  is important, careful consider ation  of \nthe power supply and ground return layout helps to ensure the \nrated performance. Design t he printed circuit board ( PCB)  on \nwhich the ADCs  are mounted such that the  AD5693R /AD5692R / \nAD5691R /AD5693 lie on the analog plane. \nEnsure that t he AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R /AD5693 have \nample supply bypassing of 10 µF, in parallel with a 0.1 µF capacitor \non each supp ly that is  located as near  the package as possible  \n(ideally , right up against  the device). The 10 µF capacitors are \nof the tantalum bead type. Ensure that the 0.1 µF capacitor has  \nlow effective series resistance (ESR) and low effective series \ninductance (E SI), such as the common  ceramic types, which \nprovide a low impedance path to  ground at high frequencies to \nhandle transient currents due to internal logic switching.  In systems where many devices are on one board, it is often \nuseful to provide some heat s inking capability to allow \nthe power to dissipate easily.  \nThe LFCSP package  of the  AD5693R /AD5692R /AD5691R / \nAD5693 has an exposed pad  beneath the device. Connect this  \npad to the GND supply of the d evice. For optimum performance,  \nuse special consideration when designing the motherboard and mounting the package. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level performance, solder the exposed pad on the bottom of the package to the corresponding therm al land pad on the \nPCB.  Design thermal vias into the PCB land pad area to further \nimprove  heat dissipation.  \nThe GND plane on the device can be increased (as shown in Figure 51) to provide a natural heat sinking effect.  \nAD5693R/\nAD5692R/\nAD5691R/\nAD5693\nGND\nPLANE\nBOARD\n12077-052 \nFigure 51.
