Switching the regula-tors 180° out-of-phase also reduces the input capacitorsize and cost. Ceramic capacitors can be used forinput and output.  \nThe output voltages are programmable from 1.2V to V\nIN\nusing external feedback resistors, or can be preset to\n1.8V or 3.3V for output 1 and 1.5V or 2.5V for output 2.When one output is higher than 1.2V, the second canbe configured down to sub-1V levels. Output accuracyis better than ±1% over variations in load, line, and tem-perature. Internal soft-start reduces inrush current dur-ing startup.\nAll devices feature power-on reset ( POR ). The\nMAX1971 includes a reset input (RSI), which forcesPOR low for 175ms after RSI goes low. The MAX1970\nand MAX1972 include an open-drain power-fail output(PFO) that monitors input voltage and goes high whenthe input falls below 3.94V. For USB-powered xDSLmodems, this output can be used to detect USB powerfailure. A minimum switching frequency of 1.2MHzensures operation outside the xDSL band.\nApplicationsFeatures\noCurrent-Mode, 1.4MHz Fixed-Frequency PWM\nOperation\no180° Out-of-Phase Operation Reduces Input\nCapacitor\no±1% Output Accuracy Over Load, Line, and\nTemperature Ranges\no750mA Guaranteed Output Current\no2.6V to 5.5V Input\noPower-On Reset Delay of 16.6ms (MAX1970) or\n175ms (MAX1971 and MAX1972)\noPower-Fail Output (MAX1970 and MAX1972 Only)\noPower-On Reset Input (MAX1971 Only)\noOperation Outside xDSL Band\noUltra-Compact Design with Smallest External\nComponents\noOutputs Adjustable from 0.8V to V INor 1.8V/3.3V\nand 1.5V/2.5V Preset\noAll-Ceramic Capacitor Application\noSoft-Start Reduces Inrush Current\nMAX1970/MAX1971/MAX1972Dual, 180° Out-of-Phase, 1.4MHz, 750mA Step-\nDown Regulator with POR and RSI/PFO\n________________________________________________________________ Maxim Integrated Products 116\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n91\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8LX1 PGND\nLX2\nIN\nFBSEL1\nFBSEL2\nPF0 (MAX1970/MAX1972)\nRSI (MAX1971)\nEN\nPORTOP VIEW\nMAX1970\nMAX1971MAX1972\nQSOPVCC\nCOMP1\nCOMP2FB1\nFB2\nREF\nGNDPin Configuration\nVCC\nVCCRSI\nEN\nCOMP1\nCOMP2\nFBSEL1\nFBSEL2\nREFPORPOR\nOUT1\n1.8V750mA\nOUT2\n2.5V750mARSI\nLX1\nFB2FB1\nLX2\nPGNDIN\nMAX1971ENVIN 2.6V TO 5.5VTypical Operating Circuit19-2297; Rev 1; 2/09\nFor pricing, delivery, and ordering information, please contact Maxim Direct at 1-888-629-4642,\nor visit Maxim’s website at www.maxim-ic.com.xDSL Modems\nxDSL RoutersCopper Gigabit SFP \nand GBIC ModulesUSB-Powered Devices\nDual LDO ReplacementOrdering Information\nPART TEMP RANGE PIN-PACKAGE\nMAX1970 EEE -40 °C to +85 °C 16 QSOP\nMAX1971 EEE -40 °C to +85 °C 16 QSOP\nMAX1972 EEE -40 °C to +85 °C 16 QSOP\nMAX1970/MAX1971/MAX1972Dual, 180° Out-of-Phase, 1.4MHz, 750mA Step-\nDown Regulator with POR and RSI/PFO\n2 _______________________________________________________________________________________ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nStresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device.

The MAX1970 and MAX1972 switchat 1.4 MHz while the MAX1971 switches at 700kHz. Thetwo converters on each IC switch 180° out of phasewith each other to reduce input ripple current. Thehigh-switching frequency allows use of smaller capaci-tors for filtering and decoupling. Internal synchronousrectifiers improve efficiency and eliminate the typicalSchottky freewheeling diode. The on-resistances of theinternal MOSFETs are used to sense the switch cur-rents for controlling and protecting the MOSFETs, elimi-nating current-sensing resistors to further improveefficiency and cost. \nThe input voltage range is 2.6V to 5.5V. Each converter\nhas a three-mode feedback input. Internally, OUT1 isset to either 3.3V or 1.8V, and OUT2 to 2.5V or 1.5V byconnecting FBSEL1 and FBSEL2 to V\nCCor GND,\nrespectively. When FBSEL1 or FBSEL2 are floating,each output can be set to any voltage between 1.2Vand V\nINthrough an external resistive divider. Having an\noutput below 1.2V is also possible (see the Output\nVoltage Selection section).DC-DC Controller\nThe MAX1970/MAX1971/MAX1972 family of step-downconverters uses a pulse-width-modulating (PWM) current-mode control scheme. The heart of the current-mode\nPWM controller is an open-loop comparator that com-pares the integrated voltage-feedback signal againstthe sum of the amplified current-sense signal and theslope compensation ramp. At each rising edge of theinternal clock, the internal high-side MOSFET turns onuntil the PWM comparator trips. During this on time,current ramps up through the inductor, sourcing cur-rent to the output and storing energy in a magneticfield. The current-mode feedback system regulates thepeak inductor current as a function of the output volt-age error signal. Since the average inductor current isnearly the same as the peak inductor current (assum-ing that the inductor value is relatively high to minimizeripple current), the circuit acts as a switch-modetransconductance amplifier. It pushes the output LC filter\npole, normally found in a voltage-mode PWM, to a higherfrequency. To preserve inner loop stability and eliminate\ninductor stair casing, a slope-compensation ramp issummed into the main PWM comparator. During thesecond half of the cycle, the internal high-side MOSFET\nMAX1970/MAX1971/MAX1972Dual, 180° Out-of-Phase, 1.4MHz, 750mA Step-\nDown Regulator with POR and RSI/PFO\n______________________________________________________________________________________ 11NAMEPIN\nMAX1970/MAX1972 MAX1971FUNCTION\n9 POR PORActive-Low Power-On Reset Output.

Now the inductor releases the stored energyas its current ramps down while still providing current tothe output. The output capacitor stores charge whenthe inductor current exceeds the load current and dis-charges when the inductor current is lower, smoothingthe voltage across the load. Under overload conditions,when the inductor current exceeds the current limit (seethe \nCurrent Limit section), the high-side MOSFET is notturned on at the rising edge of the clock and the low-\nside MOSFET remains on to let the inductor currentramp down.\nCurrent Sense\nThe current-sense circuit amplifies the current-sensevoltage generated by the high-side MOSFET’s on-resis-tance and the inductor current (R\nDS(ON) \x15IINDUCTOR ).\nThis amplified current-sense signal and the internalslope compensation signal are summed together intoDual, 180° Out-of-Phase, 1.4MHz, 750mA Step-\nDown Regulator with POR and RSI/PFO\n12 ______________________________________________________________________________________Figure 1.

The PWM com-\nparator turns off the internal high-side MOSFET whenthis sum exceeds the integrated feedback voltage.\nCurrent Limit\nThe internal MOSFET has a current limit of 1.2A (typ). Ifthe current flowing out of LX_ exceeds this maximum,the high-side MOSFET turns off and the synchronousrectifier MOSFET turns on. This lowers the duty cycleand causes the output voltage to droop until the currentlimit is no longer exceeded. There is also a synchro-nous rectifier current limit of -0.85A. This is to protectthe device from current flowing into LX_. If the negativecurrent limit is exceeded, the synchronous rectifier isturned off, and the inductor current continues to flowthrough the high-side MOSFET body diode back to theinput until the beginning of the next cycle or until theinductor current drops to zero.\nVCCDecoupling\nDue to the high-switching frequency and tight outputtolerance (±1%), decoupling between IN and V\nCCis\nrecommended. Connect a 10 Ωresistor between IN and\nVCCand a 0.1µF ceramic capacitor from V CCto GND.\nPlace the resistor and capacitor as close to V CCas\npossible. \nStartup\nTo reduce the supply inrush current, soft-start circuitryramps up the output voltage during startup. This isdone by charging the REF capacitor with a currentsource of 25µA. Once REF reaches 1.2V, the output isin full regulation. The soft-start time is determined from:\nSoft-start occurs when power is first applied, and when\nEN is pulled high with power already present. The partalso goes through soft-start when coming out of under-voltage lockout (UVLO) or thermal shutdown. The rangeof capacitor values for C\nREFis from 0.01µF to 1.0µF.\nUndervoltage Lockout\nIf VCCdrops below 2.35V, the MAX1970/MAX1971/\nMAX1972 assume that the supply voltage is too low toprovide a valid output voltage, and the UVLO circuitinhibits switching. Once V\nCCrises above 2.4V, the\nUVLO is disabled and the soft-start sequence initiates.\nEnable\nA logic-enable input (EN) is provided. For normal oper-ation, drive EN logic high. Driving EN low turns off bothoutputs, and reduces the input supply current toapproximately 1µA.Power-Fail Output\nThe input voltage is sensed for 5V (typical USB applica-tions), and if V\nCCdrops below 3.94V, the power-fail out-\nput (PFO) goes high. The time from PFO going high tothe outputs going out of regulation depends on the oper-ating output voltage and currents, and the upstream 5Vbus storage capacitor value, which is 120µF minimum(per USB specification, version 2.0). The lower the oper-ating voltages and currents, and the higher the storagecapacitor, the longer the elapsed time. PFO is an open-drain output, and a 10k Ωto 100kΩpullup resistor to\nV\nCC, or either output, is recommended.\nPower-On Reset\nPower-on reset ( POR) provides a system reset signal.\nDuring power-up, POR is held low until both outputs\nreach 92% of their regulated voltages, POR continues\nto be held low for a delayed period, and then goeshigh. This delay time (T\nD) for MAX1970 is 16.6ms. The\nMAX1971 and MAX1972 have a delay of 175ms. Figure2 is an example of a timing diagram.\nThe POR comparator is designed to be relatively\nimmune to short-duration negative-going output glitch-es.The \nTypical Operating Characteristics gives a plot of\nmaximum transient duration vs. POR comparator over-\ndrive. The graph was generated using a negative-goingpulse applied to an output, starting at 100mV above theactual POR threshold, dropping below the POR thresh-\nold by the percentage indicated as comparator over-drive, and then returning to 100mV above thethreshold. The graph indicates the maximum pulsewidth the output transient can have without causingPOR to trip low.\nReset Input\nReset input (RSI) is an input on the MAX1971 that,\nwhen driven high, forces the POR to go low. When RSI\ngoes low, POR goes through a delay time identical to a\npower-up event. See Figure 2 for timing diagram. RSIallows software to command a system reset. RSI mustbe high for a minimum period of 1µs in order to initiatethe POR.\nThermal-Overload Protection\nThermal-overload protection limits total power dissipa-\ntion. When the IC’s junction temperature exceeds T J=\n+170°C, a thermal sensor shuts down the device,allowing the IC to cool. The thermal sensor turns thepart on again after the junction temperature cools by20°C. This results in a pulsed output during continuousoverload conditions. \nDuring a thermal event, POR goes low, PFO goes high,\nand soft-start is reset. tV\nICC SSREF\nREFREF REF == × × 48 1 04.\nMAX1970/MAX1971/MAX1972Design Procedure\nOutput Voltage Selection\nBoth output voltages can be selected in three different\nways as indicated by Table 1. Each output has two pre-set voltages that can be set using FBSEL_ and it canalso be set to any voltage from 0.8V to V\nINby using an\nexternal resistor voltage-divider.\nTo use a resistor-divider to set the output voltage to\n1.2V or higher (Figure 5), connect a resistor from FB_ toOUT_ (R_\na), and connect a resistor from FB_ to GND\n(R_b). Select the value of R_ b, between 10k Ωand\n30kΩ. Then R_ ais calculated by:\nA resistor-divider can also be used to set the voltage of\none output from 0.8V to 1.2V. To do this, the other out-put must be above 1.2V. Figure 6 shows an example of\nthis where OUT1 is set to 1V. To set the output voltage toless than 1.2V, connect a resistor from FB1 to OUT1 (R1),and from FB1 to OUT2 (R2). Select values of R1 and R2such that current flowing through R1 and R2 is about100µA and following equation is satisfied:Each output is capable of continuously sourcing up to\n750mA of current as long as the following condition ismet:\nInductor Value\nA 3.3µH to 6.8µH inductor with a saturation current of800mA (min) is recommended for most applications.For best efficiency, the inductor’s DC resistance shouldbe less than 100m Ω, and saturation current should be\ngreater than 1A.

Themaximum inductor current is:\nInput Capacitor\nThe input filter capacitor reduces peak currents drawnfrom the power source and reduces noise and voltageripple on the input caused by the circuit’s switching.The input capacitor must meet the ripple currentrequirement (I\nRMS) imposed by the switching currents\ndefined by the following equation:\nA ceramic capacitor is recommended due to its low\nequivalent series resistance (ESR), equivalent seriesinductance (ESL), and lower cost. Choose a capacitorthat exhibits less than a 10°C temperature rise at themaximum operating RMS current for optimum long-termreliability.Output Capacitor\nThe key selection parameters for the output capacitorare its capacitance, ESR, ESL, and the voltage ratingrequirements. These affect the overall stability, outputripple voltage, and transient response of the DC-DCconverter. \nThe output ripple is due to variations in the charge\nstored in the output capacitor, the voltage drop due tothe capacitor’s ESR, and the voltage drop due to thecapacitor’s ESL.\nThe output voltage ripple due to the output capaci-\ntance, ESR, and ESL is:\nV\nRIPPLE (ESL) = (IP-P/TON) \x15ESL or (I P-P/TOFF) \x15ESL,\nwhichever is greater.\nIP-Pis the peak-to-peak inductor current: \nThese equations are suitable for initial capacitor selec-\ntion, but final values should be set by testing a proto-type or evaluation circuit. As a rule, a smaller ripplecurrent results in less output voltage ripple. Since theinductor ripple current is a factor of the inductor value,the output voltage ripple decreases with larger induc-tance. Ceramic capacitors are recommended due totheir low ESR and ESL at the switching frequency of theconverter. For ceramic capacitors, the ripple voltagedue to ESL is negligible. \nLoad transient response depends on the selected out-\nput capacitor.

After a short time (see the \nTypical Operating\nCharacteristics ), the controller responds by regulating\nthe output voltage back to its nominal state. The con-troller response time depends on the closed-loopbandwidth. With a higher bandwidth, the response timeis faster, thus preventing the output from deviating fur-ther from its regulating value.\nCompensation Design\nAn internal transconductance error amplifier is used tocompensate the control loop. Connect a series resistorand capacitor between COMP and GND to form a pole-zero pair. The external inductor, internal high-sideMOSFET, output capacitor, compensation resistor, andcompensation capacitor determine the loop stability.The inductor and output capacitor are chosen basedon performance, size, and cost. Additionally, the com-pensation resistor and capacitor are selected to opti-mize control-loop stability. The component valuesshown in the typical application circuits (Figures 3, 4,and 5) yield stable operation over a broad range ofinput-to-output voltages. \nThe controller uses a current-mode control scheme that\nregulates the output voltage by forcing the requiredcurrent through the external inductor. The voltageacross the internal high-side MOSFET’s on-resistance(R\nDS(ON) ) is used to sense the inductor current. Current\nmode control eliminates the double pole caused by theinductor and output capacitor, which has large phaseshift that requires more elaborate error-amplifier com-pensation. A simple Type 1 compensation with singlecompensation resistor (R\nC) and compensation capaci-\ntor (C C) is all that is needed to have a stable and high-\nbandwidth loop.\nThe basic regulator loop consists of a power modulator,\nan output feedback divider, and an error amplifier. Thepower modulator has DC gain set by gmc x R\nLOAD ,\nwith a pole and zero pair set by R LOAD , the output\ncapacitor (C OUT), and its ESR. Below are equations\nthat define the power modulator:\nThe pole frequency for the modulator is:The zero frequency for the output capacitor ESR is:\nwhere, R LOAD = VOUT/IOUT(MAX) , and GMC = 2µS. The\nfeedback divider has a gain of G FB= VFB/VOUT, where\nVFBis equal to 1.2V. The transconductance error ampli-\nfier has a DC gain, G EA(DC) , of 60dB. A dominant pole\nis set by the compensation capacitor, C C, the output\nresistance of the error amplifier (R OEA), 20MΩ, and the\ncompensation resistor, R C. A zero is set by R Cand C C. \nThe pole frequency set by the transconductance ampli-\nfier output resistance, and compensation resistor andcapacitor is:\nThe zero frequency set by the compensation capacitor\nand resistor is:\nFor best stability and response performance, the\nclosed-loop unity-gain frequency must be much higherthan the modulator pole frequency. In addition, theclosed-loop unity-gain frequency should be approxi-mately 50kHz. The loop gain equation at unity gain fre-quency then is:\nWhere G\nEA(fc) = gm EA\x15RC, and G MOD(fc) = gmc \x15\nRLOAD \x15fpMOD /fc, where gm EA= 50µS, R Ccan be \ncalculated as:\nThe error-amplifier compensation zero formed by R C\nand C Cis set at the modulator pole frequency at maxi-\nmum load.

The switching power stage requires par-ticular attention. Follow these guidelines for good PCBlayout:\n1) Place decoupling capacitors as close to IC pins as\npossible. Keep power ground plane (connected toPGND) and signal ground plane (connected toGND) separate. Connect the two ground planestogether with a single connection from PGND toGND.\n2) Input and output capacitors are connected to the\npower ground plane; all other capacitors are con-nected to signal ground plane.\n3) Keep the high-current paths as short and wide as\npossible.\n4) If possible, connect IN, LX1, LX2, and PGND sepa-\nrately to a large land area to help cool the IC to fur-ther improve efficiency and long-term reliability. \n5) Ensure all feedback connections are short and\ndirect.
