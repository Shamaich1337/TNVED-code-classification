The \ntransceiver implements the  Ethernet physical layer \nportion of the 1000 BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and \n10BASE-T standards. It is manufactured using standard digital CMOS process and contains all the  active  circuitry \nrequired to implement the physical layer functions to \ntransmit and receive data on standard CAT 5 unshielded \ntwisted pair. \nThe device supports the RGMII (Reduced  pin count \nGMII) and SGMII for direct connection to a MAC/Switch \nport. The  SGMII can also be used on media/line side  to \nconnect to SFP modules that support 1000BASE-X, \n100BASE-FX  and SGMII. It al so supports Copper/Fiber \nAuto-media  applications with RGMII as the MAC \ninterface. SGMII operates at  1.25 Gbps over a single \ndifferential pair thus reducing power and number of I/Os used on the MAC interface. \nThe device integrates MDI term ination  resistors into the \nPHY. This resistor integrat ion simplifies board layout and \nreduces board cost by reducing  the number of external  \ncomponents. The new Marvell\n® calibrated resistor \nscheme will achieve and exceed the accuracy \nrequirements of the IEEE 802.3  return  loss \nspecifications. \nThe device has an integrated switching voltage regulator \nto  generate  all required voltages. The device can run off \na single 3.3V supply.  The device supports 1.8V, 2.5V, \nand 3.3V  LVCMOS I/O Standards. \nThe 88E1510/88E1518/88 E1512/88E1514 device  \nsupports Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) and Precise Timing Protocol (PTP) Time Stamping, which is based on  \nIEEE1588 version 2 and IEEE802.1AS. \nThe 88E1510/88E1518/88 E1512/88E1514 device  \nsupports IEEE 802.3az-2010 Energy Efficient Ethernet \n(EEE) and is IEEE 8 02.3az-2010 compliant. \nThe device incorporates the Marvell Advanced Virtual \nCable Tester\n® (VCT™) feature, which us es Time  Domain \nReflectometry (TDR) technology for the remote \nidentification of potential cable malfunctions, thus \nreducing equipment returns and  service  calls. Using \nVCT, the Alaska device  detects and reports potential  cabling issues such as pair swaps, pair polarity and excessive  pair skew. The device will also  detect cable \nopens, shorts or any impedance mismatch in the cable  \nand reporting accurately within one meter the distance to  \nthe fault. \nThe device uses advanced mixed-signal processing  to  \nperform equalization, echo  and crosstalk cancellation, \ndata recovery, and error correction  at a Gigabits per \nsecond data rate. The device achieves robust \nperformance  in noisy environments with very low power  \ndissipation.  \nFeatures \n\uf06e10/100/1000BASE-T IE EE 802.3 compliant \n\uf06eMultiple Operating Modes \n• RGMII to Copper \n• SGMII to Copper (88E1512/88E1514 device \nonly) \n• RGMII to Fiber/SGMII (88E1512  device only) \n• RGMII to Copper/Fiber/SGMII with Auto-Media Detect (88E1512 device  only) \n• Copper to Fiber (1000BASE-X) (88E1512/88E1514) \n\uf06eFour RGMII timing  modes including integrated \ndelays - This eliminates the need for adding  trace \ndelays on the PCB \n\uf06eSupports 1000BASE-X and 100BASE-FX on the \nFiber interface along with SGMII (88E1512  device \nonly) \n\uf06eSupports LVCMOS I/O Standards on  the  RGMII \n\uf06eSupports Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) - IEEE \n802.3az-2010 compliant \n• EEE Buffering \n• Incorporates EEE buffering  for seamless support \nof legacy MACs \n\uf06eUltra Low  Power \n\uf06eIntegrated MDI termination resistors that el  iminate \npassive components \n\uf06eIntegrated  Switching Voltage Regulators \n\uf06eSupports Green Ethernet \n• Active Power Save Mode \n• Energy Detect and Energy Detect+ low power \nmodes \n\uf06eIEEE1588  version 2 Time Stamping \n  \n Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

For modes of operation  \nsupported by 88E1510, 88E1518, 88E1514, refer to  Table 1 . \nThe behavior of  the 1.25  GHz SERDES interface  is selected  by setting the MODE[2:0]  register in \n20_18.2:0. Th e SERDES can operate in 100BASE-FX, 10 00BASE-X, SGMII (System), and SGMII \n(Media). \nTable 34: MODE[2:0] Select \nMODE[2:0] Register 20_18.2:0 Description \n000 RGMII (System mode) to Copper \n001 SGMII (System mode) to Copper \n010 RGMII (System mode) to 1000BASE-X \n011 RGMII (System mode) to 100BASE-FX \n100 RGMII (System mode) to SGMII (Media mode) \n101 Reserved \n110 Reserved \n111 Reserved \n20_18.2:0 defaults to 111 for 88E1512/88E1514.  Therefore 20_18.2:0 must  be programmed with the \ndesired mode of operation. \n20_18.2:0 defaults to 000 for 88E1510/88E1518. \nWhen link is up, two of the three interfaces pass packets back and  forth.  The  unused  interface is  \npowered down.  \nThere is no need to power down  the  unused  interfac e via registers 0_0.11  and 0_1.11.  The unused \ninterface will automatically  power down  when not needed. \n2.2 Copper Media Interface \nThe copper interface  consists of the  MDIP/N[3:0] pins  that connect to the  physical media for \n1000BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 10 BASE-T modes of  operation. \nThe device  integrates MDI termination  resistors.  The IEEE 802.3 specification requires that both  \nsides of a link have  termination resistors to prevent reflections. Traditionally, these resistors and  \nadditional capacitors are placed on  the board bet ween  a PHY device and the magnetics.  The  \nresistors have to be very accura te to meet the strict  IEEE return loss requirements. Typically, ± 1% \naccuracy resistors are used on the board.  These additional  components between the PHY and the \nmagnetics complicate board  layout.  Integrating the resistors has many advantages including \ncomponent cost savings, better ICT yield,  board reliability improvements, board area savings, \nimproved  layout, and signal integrity improvements. \n2.2.1 Transmit Side Network Interface \n2.2.1.1 Multi-mode TX Digital to Analog Converter \nThe device  incorporates a multi-mode  transmit  DAC to generate filtered 4D  PAM 5, MLT3, or \nManchester coded symbols. The transmit DAC performs signal wave shaping to reduce EMI. The \ntransmit  DAC is designed  for very low parasitic loading capacitances to improve  the  return  loss \nrequirement, which allows the use of low cost transformers. \n  \n  Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

In  100BASE-TX mode, slew rate control is used  to minimize  high frequency EMI. In  \n10BASE-T mode, the output waveform is pre-equalized via a digital filter. \n2.2.2 Encoder \n2.2.2.1 1000BASE-T \nIn  1000BASE-T mode, the  transmit data bytes are sc rambled to 9-bit symbols and encoded  into 4D \nPAM5  symbols. Upon initialization, the initial scrambling seed is determined by the  PHY  address.  \nThis prevents multiple devices from outputting th e same sequence during  idle, which helps to reduce \nEMI. \n2.2.2.2 100BASE-TX \nIn  100BASE-TX mode, the transmit data  stream  is 4B/5B encoded, serialized, and  scrambled. \n2.2.2.3 10BASE-T \nIn 10BASE-T mode, the transmit da ta is  serialized and conver ted to Manchester encoding. \n2.2.3 Receive Side Network Interface \n 2.2.3.1 Analog to Digital Converter \nThe device incorporates an advanced high spe ed ADC on each receive channel with greater \nresolution than the ADC used in the reference  model of  the  IEEE 802.3ab  standard committee. \nHigher resolution ADC results in better SNR, and therefore, lower error rates. Patented architectures \nand design techniques result in high differential and integral linearity,  high power supply noise  \nrejection,  and low metastability error rate.  The  ADC samples the  input signal at 125 MHz.  \n2.2.3.2 Active Hybrid \nThe device employs a sophisticated  on-chip hybrid to  substantially reduce the near-end echo, which \nis the super-imposed transmit signal on the receiv e  signal. The hybrid  minimizes the echo to reduce \nthe precision requirement  of the digital echo cancelle r.  The on-chip hybrid  allows both the  transmitter \nand receiver to use the same transformer for coup ling to the twisted pair cable,  which reduces the  \ncost of the overall system. \n2.2.3.3 Echo Canceller \nResidual  echo not  removed by the hybrid and ec ho due to patch cord impedance  mismatch,  patch \npanel discontinuity, and variations in  cable impedance along the twisted pair cable result in drastic \nSNR degradation on the receive signal.  The device employs a fully developed digital echo canceller \nto  adjust for echo impairments from more than 10 0 meters of cable.  The echo  canceller is  fully \nadaptive to  compensate for the  time varying  nature of channel  conditions. \n2.2.3.4 NEXT Canceller \nThe 1000BASE-T physical layer uses all  4 pairs of  wires to transmit data to reduce  the baud rate  \nrequirement to  only 125 MHz.  This results in sign ificant high frequency crosstalk between  adjacent  \npairs of cable  in the  same  bundle.  The  device employs 3 parallel NEXT cancellers on each receive \nchannel to cancel  any high frequency crosstalk in duced  by the adjacent 3 transmitters.  A fully \nadaptive digital filter  is used  to compensate for the time varying nature  of channel conditions.  \n   \n Doc. No. MV-S107146-U0 Rev.

The \ndevice  employs an advanced baseline wander cancellation circuit to  automatically compensate for \nthis DC shift. It  minimizes the effect of DC baseline shift  on the overall  error rate. \n2.2.3.6 Digital Adaptive Equalizer \nThe digital adaptive equalizer removes inter-symbol interference at  the receiver.  The digital adaptive \nequalizer takes unequalized signals from ADC output and uses a combination of feedforward \nequalizer (FFE) and decision feedback equalizer (D FE) for the best-optimized signal-to-noise (SNR) \nratio. \n2.2.3.7 Digital Phase Lock Loop \nIn  1000BASE-T mode, the  slave transmitter must us e the exact receive clock frequency it sees on  \nthe receive signal.  Any slight long-term frequency phase jitter (frequency drift) on the receive signal  \nmust be  tracked  and duplicated by the slave transmi tter; otherwise, the receivers of both the slave \nand master physical layer devices have difficulty  canceling the echo  and NEXT  components.  In the \ndevice, an advanced DPLL is used to recover and track the clock timing information from the receive signal.  This DPLL has very low long-term phase jitter of  its own, thereby maximizing the  achievable \nSNR. \n2.2.3.8 Link Monitor \nThe link monitor is responsible fo r determining if link is establish ed with a link partner. In 10BASE-T  \nmode, link monitor function  is  performed  by  detecting the presence  of valid link pulses (NLPs) on  the \nMDIP/N pins. \nIn 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T modes, link is esta blished by scrambled idles. \nIf Force L  ink Good register 16_0.10 is set high, t  he l ink is forced to  be good and the link monitor is \nbypassed for 100BASE-TX and 10BASE-T modes.  In the 1000BASE-T mode, register 16_0.10 has \nno effect. \n2.2.3.9 Signal Detection \nIn 1000BASE-T mode, si gnal detection is based on whether the local receiver has acquired lock to \nthe incoming data stream. \nIn  100BASE-TX mode, the signal detection function  is  based on the receive  signal  energy detected \non the MDIP/N pins that  is  continuously qualified by the  squelch detect circuit, and the  local receiver  \nacquiring lock. \n2.2.4 Decoder \n2.2.4.1 1000BASE-T \nIn 1000BASE-T  mode, the receive idle stream is analyzed so that the scrambl er seed, the skew \namong the 4 pairs, the pair swap  order, and the polarity of the pairs can be accounted for. Once  \ncalibrated, the  4D  PAM 5 symbols are converted to  9-bit symbols that are then  descrambled  into  \n8-bit data values.  If the descrambler loses lock for any reason, the link is brought  down and\ncalibration is restarted after the completion of  Auto-Negotiation.\n  \n  Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

The NRZ \nstream is descrambled  and aligned  to the symbol boundaries. The aligned data is then parallelized \nand  5B/4B decoded.  The receiver does not  attempt  to decode the data stream unless the  scrambler  \nis locked. The descrambler “locks” to the scrambler  state  after detecting a sufficient number of  \nconsecutive  idle code-groups.  Once locked, the descr ambler continuously monitors the data stream \nto make sure that it  has not lost synchroniza tion. The descrambler is always forced into the unlocked   \nstate  when a link failure condition is detected, or when insufficient idle  symbols are  detected.    \n2.2.4.3 10BASE-T \nIn 10BASE-T mode, the recovered 10BASE-T signal is decoded from Manchester to NRZ, and then  \naligned. The alignment is necessary to insure that the start of frame delimiter (SFD) is aligned to the \nnibble boundary. \n2.3 1.25 GHz SERDES Interface \nThe 1.25 GHz SERDES Interface can be configured as  an  SGMII to be  hooked up  to a MAC or as a  \n100BASE-FX/1000BASE-X/SGMII to  be hooked up to  the  media. \n2.3.1 Electrical Interface \nThe input and output buffers of the 1.25 GHz SERDES interface are internally terminated  by  50Ω  \nimpedance. No external  terminations are r equired.  The output swing  can  be adjusted by  \nprogramming register 26_1.2:0.  The 1.25 GHz SERDES I/Os are Current Mode Logic (CML) buffers.  \nCML I/Os can be used to  connect to  other components  with PECL or LVDS I/Os.

This interface  supports  10, 100 and 1000 \nMbps modes of operation. \n2.4.1.1 SGMII Speed and Link \nWhen the SGMII MAC  interface  is  used,  the media interface can only be  copper.  The operational  \nspeed of the SGMII MAC interface is determined according to  Table 35  media interface status \nand/or loopback mode.  \n                         \nTable 35: SGMII (System Interface) Operational Speed \nLink Status or Media Interface Status SGMII (MAC Interface) Speed \nNo Link Determined by speed setting of Register 21_ \n2.6,13 \nMAC Loopback Determined by speed setting of Register 21_2.6, \n13 \n1000BASE-T at 1000 Mbps 1000 Mbps \n100BASE-TX at 100 Mbps 100 Mbps \n10BASE-T at 10 Mbps 10 Mbps \nTwo registers are available to  determine whether the  SGMII achieved link and sync.  Status Register \n17_1.5 indicates that the SERDES locked onto the incoming KDKDKD… sequence.  Register 17_ \n1.10 indicates whether link is established on the SERDES. If SGMII Auto-Negotiation  is disabled, \nregister 17_1.10 has the same meani ng as register 17_1.5.  If SGMII  Auto-Negotiation  is  enabled,  \nthen register 17_1.10 indicates whether SGMII  Auto-Negotiation successfully established link. \n2.4.1.2 SGMII TRR Blocking \nWhen the SGMII receives a packet with odd number of bytes, a single symbol of  carrier  extension \nwill be  passed on and transmitted onto  1000BASE-T.  This carrier extension may cause problems \nwith full-duplex MACs that incorrectly handle th e  carrier extension symbols. When register 16_1.13 \nis set to 1,  all carrier extend and carrier extend with error symbols received  by t he SGMII  will be \nconverted  to idle symbols when operating in full-duplex. Carrier extend and carrier extend with error \nsymbols will not be blocked when operating in half-duplex, or if register 16_1.13 is set to  0. Note that  \nsymbol errors will  continue to be propagated  regardless of the setting of  register  16_1.13. \n2.4.1.3 False SERDES Link Up Prevention \nThe SERDES interface can operat e in 1000BASE-X mode where an unconnected optic al receiver \ncan sometimes send full swing  noise into the PHY.  This  random noise will  look like a real signal and  \nfalsely cause the 1000BASE-X PCS to link up. \nA noise filtering state machine can be enabled to  reduce the probability of false link up. When the  \nstate  machine is enabled  it will ca  use a small del ay in link up  time.  1000BASE-X noise  filtering is \nenabled  through the register below. \nTable 36: Fiber Noise Filtering \nRegister Function Setting Mode HW \nRst SW Rst \n26_1.14 1000BASE-X \nNoise Filtering 1 = Enable 0 = Disable R/W 0 Retain \n  \n  Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

When  \nthe speed  of the PHY changes,  a  similar stretching  of the positive  or  negative pulse is allowed. No \nglitching of  the clocks is allowed during speed transitions. \nThe MAC must hold TX_CTRL (TX_CTL) low until t he MAC has ensured that  TX_CTRL (TX_CTL) is \noperating at the  same  speed as the PHY. \n2.4.4 TX_ER and RX_ER Coding \nSee the RGMII  Specifications for definitions of  TX_ER,  RX_ER, and in band status coding. \nIn  RGMII mode, Register 21_2.3 is the register bit  used to  block carrier extension. \n2.5 Loopback \nThe device  implements various different  loopback paths. \n2.5.1 System Interface Loopback \nThe functionality, timing, and signal integrity of the System interface can be tested by placing the \ndevice in  System interface loopback mode.  This can be accomplished by setting register 0_0.14 = 1,  \nif  copper is the selected media,  or 0_1.14 = 1, if fiber is the selected  media.  In loopback mode, the \ndata received from the MAC is not transmitted out on the media interface. Instead, the data is  looped \nback and sent to the MAC. During loopback, media link will be lost and packets will not be received.  \nIf loopback is enabled  while  Auto-Negotiating, FLP  Auto-Negotiation codes will be transmitted  onto  \nthe copper media.  If  loopback is enabled in forced 10BASE-T mode, 10BASE-T  idle link pulses will  \nbe transmitted on the copper side.  If  loopback is enabled in forced 100BASE-T mode, 100BASE-T  \nidles will be transmitt ed on the copper side. \nThe speed of the SGMII  or RGMII is determined by register 21_2.6, 13 during loopback. 21_2.2:6,13 \nis 00 = 10  Mbps, 01 = 100 Mbps, 10  =  1000  Mbps. \n  \n  Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

Frames from a  link partner into the PHY, before reaching  the MAC interface pins, are \nlooped back and sent out on the line.  They are also  sent  to the MAC.  The packets received from  the \nMAC are ignored during line  loopback. Refer to  Figure 16 .  This allows the link partner to receive its \nown frames. \nBefore enabling the line  loopback feature, the PHY must first establish link to another PHY  link \npartner. If  Auto-Negotiation is enabled,  both link partners should advertise the same speed and  \nfull-duplex. If  Auto-Negotiation is disabled, both link partners need to be forced to  the  same speed \nand  full-duplex.  Once link is established, the line loopback mode can be  enabled.  \nRegister 21_2.14 = 1 enables the line loopback on the copper interface. \nRegister 16_1.12 = 1 and 16_1.8 = 0 enables the line loopback of  the 1000BASE-X/SGMII media \ninterface. \nFigure 16: Copper Line Loopback Data Path                          \n \nSERDES (SGMII) or RGMII \nPCS (Copper) \nPMA (Copper) \nPMD (Copper) MAC \nSystem Interface \n21_2.14 = 1 \nCopper Interface SERDES (SGMII) or RGMII\nPCS (Copper)\nPMA (Copper)\nPMD (Copper)MAC\nSystem Interface21_2.14 = 1\nCopper Interface\n                         \n  \n  Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

For \n1000BASE-T mode, register 18_6.3 must be set to 1 to enable the external loop back.

In Mode 2, the 10BASE-T  link pulses are sent  once every second whil e listening for energy \non the line.  \nDetails of each mode are described below. \n2.7.1.1 IEEE Power Down Mode \nThe standard IEEE power down  mode is entered by se tting register 0_0.11 or  0_1.11. In  this mode, \nthe PHY does not respond to  any system interface (i.e., RGMII/SGMII) signals except the \nMDC/MDIO. It also  does not respond  to any activity on the copper or fiber media.  \nIn  this  power down  mode,  the PHY cannot  wake up on its own by detecting  activity on the media. It  \ncan only wake up by setting registers 0_0.11  and 16_0.2  = 0 for copper and 0_1.11 = 0 for Fiber. \nNote  that Register 0_0.11 or 16_0.2 may be  set to  1 to power down the copper media. \nAs shown in Table 39 , each power down  control  independently powers down its respective  circuits.  \nIn general, it is not necessary to  power down an unused  interface. The PHY  will automatically power \ndown any unused circuit.  \nThe automatic PHY power management can be  overridden by setting  the  power down  control bits. \nThese bits have priority over the PHY power  management in  that the circuit  can not  be powered up \nby the power management when its associated power  down bit is set to 1. When a circuit is power  \nback up by setting the bit to 0, a software  reset is also  automatically sent to  the corresponding \ncircuit. \nTable 39: Power Down Control Bits \nReset Register Register Effect \n0_0.11 Copper Power Down \n16_0.2 Copper Power Down \n0_1.11 Fiber/SGMII Power Down \n2.7.1.2 Copper Energy Detect Modes \nThe device  can  be placed in energy detect power down  modes by  selecting either of the two energy  \ndetect modes. Both modes enable the PHY to wake up on its own by  detecting activity on the CAT 5 \ncable.  The  status of the energy detect  is reported  in register 17_0.4 and the energy detect changes \nare reported  in register 19_0.4 . The energy detect  modes only app ly to the copper media.  The \nenergy detect modes will not work while Fiber/Copper Auto Select ( 2.5  “Fiber/Copper \nAuto-Selection” on page 45 ) is enabled. Normal 10/100/1000 Mbps operation can be entered  by  \nturning off energy detect mode by setting register 16_0.9:8 to  0x. \nEnergy Detect (Mode 1) \nEnergy Detect (Mode 1) is entered  by setting register 16_0.9:8 to 10. \nIn  Mode 1, only the signal detection  circuitry and serial  management interface  are active. If the PHY  \ndetects  energy on  the line,  it starts to  Auto-Negot iate sending  FLPs for 5 seconds. If at the  end of  \n5 seconds the Auto-Negotiation  is not completed,  then  the PHY stops sending FLPs and goes back \nto  monitoring  receive energy. If  Auto-Negotiation is completed, then  the PHY goes into  normal \n10/100/1000  Mbps  operation. If during normal  operation the  link is lost, the PHY will  re-start  \nAuto-Negotiation. If no energy is detected after 5 seconds, the PHY goes back to monitoring receive \nenergy. \n   \n Doc. No. MV-S107146-U0 Rev.

If the device is in Mode 1, it  cannot wake  \nup a  connected  device; therefore, the connected dev ice  must be transmitting NLPs, or either  device \nmust be  woken up  through register access. If the  device is in Mode  2, then  it can wake  a  connected \ndevice.  \nPower Down Modes \nWhen the PHY exits power down  (register 0_0.11= 0  and 16_0.2=0)  the active state  will depend  on  \nwhether the energy detect function  is enabled (regist er 16_0.9:8 = 1x).  If the energy detect  function  \nis enabled, the PHY will  transition to  the energy detec t  state first and  will wake up  only if  there  is a \nsignal on the wire. \nTable 40: Power Down Modes \nRegister 0_0.11 Register 16_0.2 Register 16_0.9:8 Behavior \n1 x xx Power down \nx 1 xx Power down \n2.7.2 RGMII/SGMII MAC Interface Power Down \nIn some applications,  the MAC interface must run  continuously regardless of the state  of the media  \ninterface.

It is  used to  negotiate  speed, dupl ex, and  flow  control over CAT5 UTP  cable. Once \nAuto-Negotiation is initiated, the device determines whether or not  the remote device has \nAuto-Negotiation  capability. If so, the device and the remote device  negotiate the speed and  duplex  \nwith which to operate.  \nIf the remote  device does not  have Auto-Negotiation capability,  the  device uses the parallel detect  \nfunction to  determine the speed  of the remote  device for 100BASE-TX and 10BASE-T  modes.  If link \nis established based on the parallel detect function, t hen it is required to  establish link at  half-duplex  \nmode only. Refer to IEEE 802.3 clauses 28 and  40  for a full description of  Auto-Negotiation. \nAfter hardware reset, 10/100/ 1000BASE-T Auto-Negotiation can be enabled and disabled via \nRegister  0_0.12.  Auto MDI/MDIX  and Auto-Negotiation may be disabled  and enabled  independently. \nWhen Auto-Negotiation is disabled, the speed a  nd duplex can be set via registers 0_0.13, 0_0.6, \nand  0_0.8 respectively. When  Auto-Negotiation is enabled  the abilities that are advertised  can be  \nchanged via registers 4_0 and 9_0. \nChanges to  registers 0_0.12, 0_0.13, 0_0.6 and 0_0.8 do not take effect unless one of the following \ntakes place:  \n\uf06eSoftware reset (registers 0_0.15)\n\uf06eRestart  Auto-Negotiation (register 0_0.9)\n\uf06eTransition from power down to power up  (register  0_0.11)\n\uf06eThe copper link goes down\nTo enable or disable Auto-Negotiation, Register 0_0.12 should be changed  simultaneously with  \neither register 0_0.15 or 0_0.9 . For example, to disable Auto -Negotiation a nd force 10BASE-T  \nhalf-duplex  mode, register 0_0 should be written with 0x8000.  \nRegisters 4_0 and 9_0 are internally latched once ev ery time the Auto-Negotiation  enters the Ability \nDetect  state in the arbitration state machine.  Henc e, a write into Register 4_0 or 9_0 has no effect  \nonce  the device  begins  to  transmit Fast Link Puls es (FLPs).This guarantees that sequences of FLPs \ntransmitted are consistent  with one another. \nRegister  7_0 is treated in a similar way as  registers 4_0 and 9_0 during additional next page  \nexchanges. \nIf  1000BASE-T  mode is advertised, then the device  automatically sends the appropriate next  pages \nto  advertise the capability and  negotiate Master/Slave mode of operation.  If  the  user  does not  wish \nto  transmit additional next  pages, then the next  page  bit (Register 4_0.15) can be  set to  zero, and  \nthe user needs to take no further action.  \nIf  next  pages in addition  to the ones required for 1000BASE-T are needed, then the user can set \nregister 4_0.15 to on  e, a nd send a  nd receive ad  ditional next pages via registers 7_0 and 8_0,  \nrespectively. The device  stores the previous results fr om register 8 in internal registers,  so that new \nnext pages can  overwrite register 8_0. \nNote that  1000BASE-T next  page exchanges are  automatically handled by the  device without user \nintervention, regardless of  whether or not additional next  pages are sent. \nOnce the  device completes Auto-Negotiation, it  updates the various status in registers 1_0, 5_0, 6_ \n0,  and 10_0.  Speed, duplex,  page received,  and Auto-Negotiation completed status are also \navailable in registers 17_0 and 19_0.  \nRefer to  Register  17_0 and 19_0. \n   \n Doc. No. MV-S107146-U0 Rev.

It  is  used to  \nAuto-Negotiate duplex and flow control over fiber cable. Registers 0_1, 4_1, 5_1, 6_1, and 15_1 are  \nused  to enable AN, advertise capabilities,  determine link partner’s  capabilities, show AN status, and \nshow the duplex mode  of operation respectively. \nRegister  22.7:0  must be set  to one  to view the fiber Auto-Negotiation registers. \nThe device supports Next Page option for 1000BA SE-X Auto-Negotiation.  Register 7_1  of the fiber \npages is used to transmit  Next Pages, and register  8_1  of the fiber pages is  used to  store the \nreceived Next  Pages.  The Next Page exchange  occu rs with  software intervention.  The user  must set \nRegister  4_1.15 to  enable fiber Next  Page exchange. Each Next  Page received  in the registers \nshould be read  before a new Next Page to be transmitted  is  loaded in Register 7_1.  \nIf the PHY  enables 1000BASE-X Auto-Negotiation and the l  ink partner does not, t  he l ink cannot link \nup.  The device implements an Auto-Negotiation bypass mode. For more details,  see \nSection 2.8.3.1, Serial Interface Auto-Negotiation  Bypass Mode, on page 53 . \n2.8.3 SGMII Auto-Negotiation \nSGMII is a de-facto stan dard designed by Cisco. SGMII uses 1 000BASE-X coding to send data as \nwell  as  Auto-Negotiation  information between the PHY and the MAC. However, the contents of  the  \nSGMII Auto-Negotiation are different than the 1000BASE-X Auto -Negotiation. See the “Cisco SGMII \nSpecification” and the “MAC Interfaces and  Auto-Negotiation” application note for further details.  \nThe device supports SGMII with and without Auto -Negotiation. Auto-Negotiation can be  enabled or \ndisabled by writing to  Register 0_1.12 followed by a soft reset. If SGMII  Auto-Negotiation is disabled,  \nthe MAC  interface  link,  speed, and duplex stat us (determined  by the media  side) cannot be  \nconveyed to  the MAC from the PHY.  The user must  program the MAC with this information in some \nother way (e.g., by reading PHY registers for li nk,  speed, and duplex status). However, the \noperational speed  of the SGMII will  follow the speed of the media (See  Table 35 on  page 43 ) \nregardless of  whether the Auto-Negotiation is enabled  or disabled. \nIn  case of RGMII  to SGMII  mode  of operation, the SGMII behaves as if it were the SGMII on the \nMAC side of  the  interface. When Auto-Negotiation is enabled, the SGMII Auto-Negotiation \ninformation like the speed, duplex, and link received from  the PHY  is used for determining the mode  \nof operation.  The RGMII  will be adjusted accordingly when the SGMII  Auto-Negotiation is  \ncompleted. \n2.8.3.1 Serial Interface Auto-Negotiation Bypass Mode \n If the MAC or the PHY implements the Auto-Negotiation function and the other does not, two-way \ncommunication is not  possible unless Auto-Negotiation is manually disabled  and both sides are  \nconfigured to  work in the same operational  modes.  To solve  this problem, the device  implements the  \nSGMII Auto-Negotiation  Bypass Mode. When entering the state “Ability_Detect”, a bypass timer \nbegins to  count  down from an initial value of approximately 200 ms. If the device  receives idles \n  \n  Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

The \nerror counter and packet  counter features are enable d  through register writes and each counter is \nstored in eight  register bits. \nRegister  18_18.2:0 controls  which path the CRC checker and  packet  counter is counting. \nIf register 18_18.2:0 is set to 010 then  the Copper receive  path is checked. \nIf register 18_18.2:0 is set to 100 t hen  the SGMII  input path is checked. \nIf register 18_18.2:0 is set to 110 then  the RGMII  input path is checked. \n2.9.1 Enabling the CRC Error Counter and Pa cket Counter \nTo enable the counters to count,  set register 18_18.2:0 to  a  non-zero value. \nTo disable the counters,  set register 18_18.2:0 to 000. \nTo read the CRC counter and packet counter,  read register 17_18. \n17_18.15:8 (Frame count is stored in these bits) \n17_18.7:0 (CRC error count is stored  in these bits) \nThe CRC counter and  packet  counter do not clear on a read command.  To clear the counters, write  \nRegister  18_18.4  =  1.  The register 18_18.4 is a se lf-clear bit.  Disabling the counters by writing  \nregister 18_18.2:0 to  000 will  also reset the  counters. \n2.10 Packet Generator \nThe device  contains a very simple packet generator.  Register 16_18.7:5  lists the  device Packet \nGenerator register details. When 16_18.7:5 is set to 010 packets are generated  on  the  copper transmit path. \nWhen 16_18.7:5 is set to 100 packets are generated  on  the  SGMII  transmit path. \nWhen 16_18.7:5 is set to 110 packets are generated on  the  RGMII transmit path. \n   \n Doc.

The payload  of the packet is \neither a fixed 5A,  A5, 5A,  A5 pattern or a pseudo random pattern.  A correct  IEEE CRC  is appended \nto the end  of the packet.  An error packet can also  be  generated.  \nThe registers are as follows: \n16_18.7:5 Packet  generation enable. 000  =  Normal operation,  Else = Enable internal  packet  \ngenerator. \n16_18.2 Payload type.  0 = Pseudo  random, 1 = Fixed 5A, A5,  5A,  A5,... \n16_18.1 Packet  length.   0  =  64 bytes, 1 = 1518 bytes \n16_18.0 Error packet.  0 = Good CRC,  1  =  Symbol error and corrupt CRC. \n16_18.15:8 Packet Burst Size. 0x00 = Continuous, 0x01  to 0xFF = Burst  1  to 255  packets. \nIf register 16_18.15:8 is set  to a non-zero value, then register 16_18.7:5 will self  clear once the \nrequired number of packets  are  generated. Note that  if register 16_18.7:5  is manually set  to 0 while  \npackets are still bursting, the bursting will cease immediately  once the current active packet finishes \ntransmitting.  The value in register 16_18.15:8 should not be changed while 16_18.7:5 is set to a  \nnon-zero value. \n2.11 1.25G PRBS Generator and Checker \nA PRBS generator and checker are available for use on the 1.25G SERDES. PRBS7,PRBS23,  and  \nPRBS31 are supported.  \nA 32-bit checker is implemented. Note  that  the reads are atomic.  A read to the LSB will update the \nMSB register.  The counters only clear when register 23_1.4 is set to 1.  This bit self clears. \nThe checker and  generator polarity  can be inverted  by setting registers 23_1.7 and  23_1.6 \nrespectively. \nRegister 23_1.5 controls whether the checker has to lock before counting commences. \nTable 42: 1.25 GHz SERDES PRBS Registers \nRegister Function Setting \n23_1.7 Invert Checker Polarity 0 = Invert \n1 = Normal \n23_1.6 Invert Generator Polarity 0 = Invert \n1 = Normal \n23_1.5 PRBS Lock 0 = Counter Free Runs \n1 = Do not start counting until PRBS locks first \n23_1.4 Clear Counter 0 = Normal \n1 = Clear Counter \n23_1.3:2 Pattern Select 00 = PRBS 7 \n01 = PRBS 23 10 = PRBS 31 11 = Generate 1010101010...pattern \n23_1.1 PRBS Checker Enable 0 = Disable \n1 = Enable \n23_1.0 PRBS Generator Enable 0 = Disable \n1 = Enable \n  \n  Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

If the device  interoperates with a \ndevice  that cannot  automatically correct  for crossover, the device makes the  necessary adjustment  \nprior to commencing  Auto-Negotiation. If the device  interoperates with  a  device that  implements \nMDI/MDIX crossover, a random algorithm as described in IEEE 802.3 clause 40.4.4 determines \nwhich  device performs the  crossover.  \nWhen the device  interoperates with legacy 10BASE-T  devices that do  not  implement  \nAuto-Negotiation, the device  follows the same  algorithm as described above since link pulses are \npresent. However, when inter operating with legacy 100BASE-TX devices that do not implement \nAuto-Negotiation  (i.e. link pulses are not  present), the device uses signal detect  to determine  \nwhether or not to crossover.  \nThe auto MDI/MDIX crossover function  can  be disabled via register  16_0.6:5. \nThe pin mapping in MDI  and MDIX modes is shown in Table 43 . \nTable 43: Media Dependent Interface Pin Mapping \nPin MDI MDIX \n1000BASE-T 100BASE-TX 10BASE-T 1000BASE-T 100BASE-TX 10BASE-T \nMDIP/N[0] BI_DA± TX± TX± BI_DB± RX± RX± \nMDIP/N[1] BI_DB± RX± RX± BI_DA± TX± TX± \nMDIP/N[2] BI_DC± unused unused BI_DD± unused unused \nMDIP/N[3] BI_DD± unused unused BI_DC± unused unused \nTable 43 assumes no crossover on PCB. \nNote \nThe MDI/MDIX status  is indicated  by Register 1 7_0.6.  This bit  indicates whether the receive pairs \n(3,6) and (1,2) are crossed over . In 1000BASE-T operation, the dev ice can correct for crossover \nbetween pairs (4,5) and (7,8) as shown in  Table 43 .  However,  this is not indicated by Register 17_ \n0.6. \nIf 1000BASE-T link is established, pairs (1,2) and (3,6) crossover is reported in register 21_5.4, and \npairs (4,5) and  (7,8) crossover is reported in  register  21_5.5. \n2.13 Polarity Correction \nThe device automatical ly corrects polarity errors on the receive pairs in 1000BASE-T and 10BASE-T  \nmodes. In  100BASE-TX mode, the polarity does not  matter.  \n   \n Doc. No. MV-S107146-U0 Rev.

Once the descrambler  is locked, the polarity is also locked on all pairs.  The polarity \nbecomes unlocked only when the receiver  loses lock. \nIn 10BASE-T mode, polarity errors  are corrected based on the dete ction of validly spaced link \npulses. The detection begins during the  MDI crossover detection phase and locks when the \n10BASE-T link is up.  The polarity becomes unlocked when link is down.  \nThe polarity correction  status is indicated by Regi ster 17_0.1. This bit indicates whether the receive  \npair (3,6) is polarity reversed in MDI mode of operation. In  MDIX mode of operation, the receive pair \nis (1,2) and Register 17_0.1 indicates whether this  pair is polarity reversed.  Although all pairs are \ncorrected for receive polarity reversal, Register 17_0.1  only indicates polarity reversal on  the pairs \ndescribed above. \nIf 1000BASE-T link is established  register 2 1_5.3:0 reports the polar ity on all 4 pairs. \nPolarity correction can  be  disabled by register write 1 6_0.1  =  1. Polarity will  then  be forced in normal \n10BASE-T mode. \n2.14 FLP Exchange Complete with No Link \nSometimes when  link does not come up, it  is difficult to determine  whether the failure  is due to the \nAuto-Negotiation Fast Link Pu lse (FLP) not completing or fr om the 10/100/1000 BASE-T link not \nbeing able to come up  . \nRegister 19_0.3 is a sticky bit that gets set to 1 whenever the FLP  exchang e is comple ted but the \nlink cannot be  established for some reason. Once the bit  is set, it  can be cleared only by reading the  \nregister. This bit  will not be set  if the FLP  exchange is not  completed, or if link is established. \n2.15 Duplex Mismatch Indicator \nWhen operating in half-duplex mode collisions should occur within  the first 512 bit  times. Collisions \nthat are detected  after this point can indicate an incorrect environment (too many repeaters in the  \nsystem, too  long  cable) or it can  indicate that the  link partner thinks the link is a full-duplex link. \nRegisters 23_6.7:0,  23_6.15:8, 24_6.7:0,  and 24_6.15:8 are 8 bit  counters that count  late  collisions. \nThey will increment  only when  the  PHY is in ha lf-duplex mode  and only applies to the copper \ninterface. Each counter in crements when a late collision is detect ed in a certain window as shown in \nTable 44 .  The four late collision counters will increment  based  on  when the late collision  starts. The \ncounters clear on read. If the counter reaches FF it will not  roll over. \n                         \n Table 44: Late Collision Registers \nRegister Function Setting Mode \n23_6.15:8 Late Collision \n97-128 bytesThis counter increments by 1 when the PHY is in half-duplex and a start of packet is received while the 96th to 128th bytes of the packet are transmitted.

In  \norder to compensate  for additional latency between the PHY  and the MAC  register  25_6.12:8  is \nused  to move the window earlier. For example, if register 25_6.12.8 is set  to 2 then the first window \nis 63 to  94 bytes, the second  window is  95  to 129 bytes, etc. It is up to  the user  to program  this \nregister correctly since it  is system  dependent. \n2.16 LED \nThe LED[2:0] pins can be used  to drive LED pins. Registers 16_3, 17_3, and 18_3 control the \noperation of the  LED pins.  LED[1:0] are used  to configure the PHY per Section 2.18.1, Hardware \nConfiguration, on page 65 .

This is  useful since the PHY is tri-spe ed and  the three colors each represent one of the \nspeeds. Register 17_3.15:12 control  the  amount to  mix in  the  LED[1] pin.  Register 17_3.11:8 control \nthe amount to  mix in  the LED[0] pin.  The mixing  is determined by the percentage of  time the LED is \non during the active state.  The percenta ge is selectable in 12.5% increments. \nNote  that there are two types  of bi-color  LEDs. Th ere is the three terminal type and  the 2 terminal  \ntype. For example,  the third and fourth LED block from the left  in Figure 21  illustrates three terminal  \ntypes,  and the one on  the far right is the  two terminal  type. In  the three terminal  type  both  of the \nLEDs can be turned on at the same time. Hence the sum  of the percentage specified by 17_3.15:12 \nand 17_3.11:8 can exceed 100%. However, in the two terminal type the sum should never exceed  \n100% since only one LED can be turned  on at any given time. \n   \n Doc. No. MV-S107146-U0 Rev.

MDC is the  \nmanagement data clock input and,  it can run from DC  to a maximum rate  of 12 MHz. At high MDIO \nfanouts the maximum rate may be decreased depending  on  the  output  loading. MDIO is  the \nmanagement data input/output  and is a bi-directio nal  signal  that runs synchronously to  MDC.  \nThe MDIO pin requires a pull-up resistor in a range from 1.5  kΩ to 10 kΩ that  pulls the MDIO  high  \nduring the idle  and turnaround phas es of read  and write operations.  \nBit  0  of the PHY address is configured during th e hardware reset  sequence.

Table 61 and Table 62  lists the valid combinations of regulator usage. \n The VDDO supply can run at 2  .5V or 3. 3V for the 88E1510 a  nd 1.8V for 88E1518. \n88E1512/88E1514 VDDO  can operate at  1.8V/2.5V/3.3V supplies depending on  the VDDO_SEL  pin  \nselection. \n\uf06eIf VDDO is tied to either 1.8V or 2. 5V, then the I/Os are not  3.3V tolerant.\n\uf06eAVDDC18  is tied  to 1.8V,  so  the XTAL_IN pin is not 2.5V/3.3V tolerant.Note \nTable 61: Power Supply Options - Inte grated Switching Regulator (REG_IN) \nFunctional \nDescription AVDD33 AVDDC18/AVDD18 DVDD Setup \nSupply Source 3.3V 1.8V from Internal \nRegulator 1.0V from Internal Regulator Single 3.3V external supply Internal regulator enabled \nTable 62: Power Supply Options - External Supplies \nFunctional Description AVDD33 AVDDC18/AVDD18 DVDD Setup \nSupply Source 3.3V 1.8V External 1.0V from \nExternal 3.3V, 1.8V, 1.0V external supplies Internal regulator disabled. \nWhen internal regulator option is preferred, both 1.0V and  1.8V regulators must be  \nused. Supplying  1.0V internally and 1.8V ex ternally (or vice versa) is  not supported.  Note \n2.21.1 AVDD18 \nAVDD18 is used as the 1.8V analog supply.  AVDD18 can be supplied externally with 1.8V, or via the \n1.8V regulator.  \n2.21.2 AVDDC18 \nAVDDC18 is  used as a 1.8V analog supply for XTAL_IN/OUT  pins. AVDDC18 can be supplied \nexternally with  1.8V, or via the 1.8V regulator. \n2.21.3 AVDD33 \nAVDD33 is used  as a 3.3V analog  supply. \n   \n Doc. No. MV-S107146-U0 Rev.

DVDD can be supplied  externally with 1.0V, or via the  \ninternal switching 1.0V regulator. \n2.21.5 REG_IN \nREG_IN is used as the 3.3V supply to the internal  regulator that generates the 1.8V for AVDD18 and \nAVDDC18  and 1.0V for DVDD. If the 1.8V  or 1.0V regulators are not  used,  REG_IN must be  left  \nfloating in addition to  leaving REGCAP1  and REGCAP2  floating. \n2.21.6 AVDD18_OUT \nAVDD18_OUT is the internal  regulator  1.8V output.  This must be connected to  1.8V po wer plane \nthat connects to  AVDD18 and AVDDC18. If an  external supply is used to supply AVDD18 and \nAVDDC18,  AVDD18_OUT must be  left floating. \n2.21.7 DVDD_OUT \nDVDD_OUT is the internal regulator 1.0V output. When internal regulator is used, DVDD_OUT must  \nbe connected to  the  DVDD  plane. If an  external supply is used  to supply DVDD,  DVDD_OUT must  \nbe left floating. \n2.21.8 VDDO \nVDDO supplies all digital I/O pins which use  LVCMOS I/O standards. The supported voltages are  \n2.5V or 3.3V f  or 88E1510. 88E1518 supports on ly 1.8V. 88E1512/88E1514 supports 2.5V/3.3V if  \nVDDO_SEL is tied to VSS and  1.8V if VDDO_SEL  is tied to VDDO which  is 1.8V. For VDDO 1.8V  \noperation, the power can  be  supplied by the internal  regulator. \n2.21.9 Power Supply Sequencing \nOn  power-up, no  special power supply sequencing is required. \n  \n  Copyright © 2022 Marvell Doc.

These are: \n•DC connection to  an LVDS  receiver\n•AC  connection  to an LVDS receiver\n•DC connection to  an CML  receiver\n•AC connection to  an CML receiver\nIf  AC  coupling or DC coupling to an LVDS receiver is used, the DC output levels  are  determined  by \nthe following: \n•Internal bias. See  Figure 24  for details. (If  AVDD18 is used to  generate  the  internal bias, the\ninternal bias  value will typically be 1.05V.)\n•The  output  voltage swing  is  programmed by Register 26_1.2:0 (see  Table 160 ).\n•Voffset (i.e., common mode voltage) = internal bias - single-ended peak-peak voltage swing.\nSee Figure 25  for details.\nIf  DC coupling is used with a CML  receiver, then  the DC levels will be  determined by a combination \nof  the MACs output structure and  the input structure shown  in  the CML Inputs diagram in  Figure 26. \nAssuming the  same  MAC CML voltage levels and structure, the common  mode output levels will be \ndetermined by: \n•Voffset (i.e., common mode voltage) = internal bias - single-ended peak-peak voltage swing/2.\nSee Figure 26  for details.\n•If  DC  coupling is used, the output voltage  DC  levels are determined by the  AC coupling  consid-\nerations above,  plus the I/O buffer structure  of the MAC.\n   \n Doc.
