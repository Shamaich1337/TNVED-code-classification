Each channel performs serial-to-parallel conversion on data characters received from peripheraldevices or modems and parallel-to-serial conversion on data characters transmitted by the CPU. The complete\nstatus of each channel of the quadruple ACE can be read by the CPU at any time during operation. Theinformation obtained includes the type and condition of the operation performed and any error conditionsencountered.\nThe TL16C554A quadruple ACE can be placed in an alternate FIFO mode, which activates the internal FIFOs\nto allow 16 bytes (plus three bits of error data per byte in the receiver FIFO) to be stored in both receive andtransmit modes. In the FIFO mode of operation, there is a selectable autoflow control feature that cansignificantly reduce software overhead and increase system efficiency by automatically controlling serial-data\nflow using RTS\n output and CTS  input signals. All logic is on the ch ip to minim ize system overhead and maximize\nsystem efficiency. T wo terminal functions allow signaling of direct-memory access (DMA) transfers. Each ACE\nincludes a programmable baud-rate generator that can divide the timing reference clock input by a divisorbetween 1 and 2\n16−1.\nThe TL16C554A is available in a 68-pin plastic-leaded chip-carrier (PLCC) FN package, 64-pin plastic quad\nflatpack (PQFP) PM package and in an 80-pin (TQFP) PN package.\nPlease be aware that an important notice concerning avail ability, standard warranty, and use in critical applications of\nTexas Instruments semiconductor products and disclaimers thereto appears at the end of this data sheet./Em\nPRODUCTION DATA information is current as of publication date.\nProducts conform to specifications per the terms of Texas Instruments\nstandard warranty.

When the following conditions exist, a FIFO character time-out interrupt occurs:\na. Minimum of one character in FIFOb. No new serial characters have been received for at least four character times. At 300 baud and 12-bit\ncharacters, the FIFO time-out interrupt causes a latency of 160 ms maximum from received character\nto interrupt generation.\nc. The receive FIFO has not been read for at least four character times.\n2. By using the XTAL1 input for a clock signal, the character times can be calculated. The delay is proportional\nto the baud rate.\n3. The time-out timer is reset after the CPU reads the receiver FIFO or after a new character is received. This\noccurs when there has been no time-out interrupt.\n4. A time-out interrupt is cleared and the timer is reset when the CPU reads a character from the receiver FIFO.\nTransmit interrupts occurs as follows when the transmitter and transmit FIFO interrupts are enabled\n(FCR0 =1, IER1 = 1).\n1. When the transmitter FIFO is empty, the transmitter holding register interrupt (IIR = 02) occurs. The interrupt\nis cleared when the transmitter holding register is written to or the IIR is read. One to sixteen characters canbe written to the transmit FIFO when servicing this interrupt.\n2. The transmitter FIFO empty indicators are delayed one character time minus the last stop-bit time whenever\nthe following occurs:\nTHRE = 1, and there have not been at least two bytes in transmit FIFO since the last THRE = 1. The first\ntransmitter interrupt comes immediately after changing FCR0, assuming the interrupt is enabled.\nReceiver FIFO trigger level and character time-out interrupts have the same priority as the receive data\navailable interrupt. The transmitter holding register empty in terrupt has the same priority as the transmitter FIFO\nempty interrupt.\nFIFO polled mode operation\nWhen the FIFOs are enabled and all interrupts are disabled, the device is in the FIFO polled mode.\nIn the FIFO polled mode, there is no time-out condition indicated or trigger level reached. However, the receive\nand transmit FIFOs still have the capability of holding characters. The LSR must be read to determine the ACEstatus.\nTL16C554A, TL16C554AI\nASYNCHRONOUS-COMMUNICATIONS ELEMENT\n/Em/Em\nSLLS509E − AUGUST 2001 − REVISED JUNE 2010\n23 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\ninterrupt-enable register (IER)\nThe IER independently enables the four serial channel interrupt sources that activate the interrupt (INTA, B, C,\nD) output. All interrupts are disabled by clearing IER0 − IER3 of the IER. Interrupts are enabled by setting theappropriate b its of the IER. Disabling the interrupt system inhibits the IIR and the active (high) interrupt output.\nAll other system functions operate in their normal manner, including the setting of the LSR and MSR. Thecontents of the IER are shown in Table 3 and described in the following bulleted list:\n/C0068Bit 0: When IER0 is set, IER0 enables the received data available interrupt and the timeout interrupts in\nthe FIFO mode.\n/C0068Bit 1: When IER1 is set, the transmitter holding register empty interrupt is enabled.\n/C0068Bit 2: When IER2 is set, the receiver line status interrupt is enabled.\n/C0068Bit 3: When IER3 is set, the modem-status interrupt is enabled.\n/C0068Bits 4 − 7: IER4 − IER7.

LCR may be read. Its contents are described in thefollowing bulleted list and shown in Figure 18.\n/C0068Bits 0 and 1: LCR0 and LCR1 are word-length select bits. These bits program the number of bits in eachserial character and are shown in Figure 18.\n/C0068Bit 2: LCR2 is the stop-bit select bit. This bit specifies the number of stop bits in each transmitted character.The receiver always checks for one stop bit.\n/C0068Bit 3: LCR3 is the parity-enable bit. When LCR3 is set, a parity bit between the last data word bit and thestop bit is generated and checked.\n/C0068Bit 4: LCR4 is the even-parity select bit. When this bit is set and parity is enabled (LCR3 is set), even parityis selected. When this bit is cleared and parity is enabled, odd parity is selected.\n/C0068Bit 5: LCR5 is the stick-parity bit. When parity is enabled (LCR3 is set) and this bit is set, the transmissionand reception of a parity bit is placed in the opposite state from the value of LCR4. This forces parity to aknown state and allows the receiver to check the parity bit in a known state.\n/C0068Bit 6: LCR6 is a break-control bit. When this bit is set, the serial outputs TXx are forced to the spacing state(low). The break-control bit acts only on the serial output and does not affect the transmitter logic. If thefollowing sequence is used, no invalid characters are transmitted because of the break.\nStep 1. Load a zero byte in response to the transmitter holding register empty (THRE) status indicator.\nStep 2. Set the break in response to the next THRE status indicator.\nStep 3.

Line-Control Register Contents\nline-status register (LSR)\nThe LSR is a single register that provides status indicators. The LSR shown in Table 6 is described in the\nfollowing bulleted list:\n/C0068Bit 0: LSR0 is the data ready (DR) bit. Data ready is set when an incoming character is received andtransferred to the receiver-buffer register or to the FIFO. LSR0 is cl eared by a CPU read of the data in the\nreceiver-buffer register or in the FIFO.\n/C0068Bit 1: LSR1 is the overrun error (OE) bit. An overrun error indicates that data in the receiver-buf fer register\nis not read by the CPU before the next character is transferred to the receiver-buffer register, thereforeoverwriting the previous character. The OE indicator is cleared whenever the CPU reads the contents ofthe LSR. An overrun error occurs in the FIFO mode after the FIFO is full and the next character is completelyreceived. The overrun error is detected by the CPU on the first LSR read after it occurs. The character inthe shift register is not transferred to the FIFO, but it is overwritten.\n/C0068Bit 2: LSR2 is the parity error (PE) bit. A parity error indicates that the received data character does nothave the correct parity as selected by LCR3 and LCR4. The PE bit is set upon detection of a parity errorand is cleared when the CPU reads the contents of the LSR. In the FIFO mode, the parity error is associated\nwith a particular character in the FIFO. LSR2 reflects the error when the character is at the top of the FIFO.\n/C0068Bit 3: LSR3 is the framing error (FE) bit. A framing error indicates that the received character does not have\na valid stop bit. LSR3 is set when the stop bit following the last data bit or parity bit is detected as a zerobit (spacing level). The FE indicator is cleared when the CPU reads the contents of the LSR. In the FIFOmode, the f raming error is associated with a particular character in the FIFO. LSR3 reflects the error when\nthe character is at the top of the FIFO.\nTL16C554A, TL16C554AI\nASYNCHRONOUS-COMMUNICATIONS ELEMENT\n/Em/Em\nSLLS509E − AUGUST 2001 − REVISED JUNE 2010\n26 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\nline-status register (LSR) (continued)\n/C0068Bit 4: LSR4 is the break interrupt (BI) bit. Break interrupt is set when the received data input is held in the\nspacing (low) state for longer than a full word transmission time (start bit + data bits + parity + stop bits).The BI indicator is cleared when the CPU reads the contents of the LSR. In the FIFO mode, this is associatedwith a particular character in the FIFO. LSR2 reflects the BI when the break character is at the top of theFIFO. The error is detected by the CPU when its associated character is at the top of the FIFO during the\nfirst LSR read. Only one zero character is loaded into the FIFO when BI occurs.\nLSR1 − LSR4 are the error conditions that produce a receiver line status interrupt (priority 1 interrupt in the\ninterrupt-identification register) when any of the conditions are detected. This interrupt is enabled by settingIER2 in the interrupt-enable register.\n/C0068Bit 5: LSR5 is the transmitter holding register empty (THRE) bit. THRE indicates that the ACE is ready toaccept a new character for transmission. The THRE bit is set when a character is transferred from thetransmitter holding register (THR) to the transmitter shift register (TSR). LSR5 is cleared when the CPUloads THR. LSR5 is not cleared by a CPU read of the LSR. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set when the transmit\nFIFO is empty, and it is cleared when one byte is written to the transmit FIFO. When the THRE interruptis enabled by IER1, THRE causes a priority 3 interrupt in the IIR. If THRE is the interrupt source indicatedby IIR, INTRPT is cleared by a read of the IIR.\n/C0068Bit 6: LSR6 is the transmitter register empty (TEMT) bit. TEMT is set when both THR and TSR are empty.LSR6 is cleared when a character is loaded into THR, and remains low until the character is transferred out\nof TXx. TEMT is not cleared by a CPU read of the LSR. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set when both thetransmitter FIFO and shift register are empty.\n/C0068Bit 7: LSR7 is the receiver FIFO error bit. The LSR7 bit is cleared in the TL16C450 mode (see FCR bit 0).In the FIFO mode, it is set when at least one of the following data errors is in the FIFO: parity error, framing\nerror, or break interrupt indicator. It is cleared when the CPU reads the LSR, unless there are subsequent\nerrors in the FIFO.\nNOTE\nThe LSR may be written. However, this function is intended only for factory test. It should be considered as read\nonly by applications software.\nTable 6.

The MCR can be written\nand read. Outputs RTS  and DTR  are directly controlled by their control bits in this register. A high input asserts\na low signal (active) at the output terminals. MCR bits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are shown as follows:\n/C0068Bit 0: When MCR0 is set, the DTR  output is forced low. When MCR0 is cleared, the DTR  output is forced\nhigh. The DTR  output of the serial channel may be input into an inverting line driver in order to obtain the\nproper polarity input at the modem or data set.\n/C0068Bit1: When MCR1 is set, the RTS  output is forced low. When MCR1 is cleared, the RTS  output is forced\nhigh. The RTS  output of the serial channel may be input into an inverting line driver to obtain the proper\npolarity input at the modem or data set.\n/C0068Bit 2: MCR2 has no effect on operation.\n/C0068Bit 3: When MCR3 is set, the external serial channel interrupt is enabled.\n/C0068Bit 4: MCR4 provides a local loopback feature for diagnostic testing of the channel. When MCR4 is set,serial output TXx is set to the marking (high) state and SIN is disconnected. The out put of the TSR is looped\nback into the RSR input. The four modem control inputs (CTS\n, DSR , DCD , and RI ) are disconnected. The\nfour modem control output bits (DTR, RTS, OUT1, and OUT2) are internally connected to the four modem\ncontrol input bits (DSR, CTS, RI, and DCD), respectively. The modem control output terminals are forcedto their inactive (high) state. In the diagnostic mode, data transmitted is received by its own receiver. Thisallows the processor to verify the transmit and receive data paths of the selected serial channel. Interruptcontrol is fully operational; however, modem-status interrupts are generated by controlling the lower fourMCR bits internally. Interrupts are not generated by activity on the external terminals represented by thosefour bits.\n/C0068Bit 5: This bit is the autoflow control enable (AFE). When set, the autoflow control is enabled, as describedin the detailed description.\nThe ACE flow control can be configured by programming bits 1 and 5 of the MCR, as shown in Table 7.\nTable 7.

Modem-Control Register Contents\nmodem-status register (MSR)\nThe MSR provides the CPU with status of the modem input lines for the modem or peripheral devices. The MSR\nallows the CPU to read the serial channel modem signal inputs by accessing the data bus interface of the ACE.\nIt also reads the current status of four bits of the MSR that indicate whether the modem inputs have changedsince the last reading of the MSR. The delta status bits are set when a control input from the modem changes\nstates, and are cleared when the CPU reads the MSR.\nThe modem input lines are CTS\n, DSR , RI, and DCD . MSR4 − MSR7 are status indicators of these lines. A status\nbit = 1 indicates the input is low. When the status bit is cleared, the input is high. When the modem-statusinterrupt in the IER is enabled (IIR3 is set), an interrupt is generated whenever any one of MSR0 − MSR3 is set,\nexcept as noted below in the delta CTS\n description. The MSR is a priority 4 interrupt. The contents of the MSR\nare described in Table 8.\n/C0068Bit 0: MSR0 is the delta clear-to-send ( ΔCTS) bit. ΔCTS indicates that the CTS  input to the serial channel\nhas changed state since it was last read by the CPU. No interrupt will be generated if auto-CTS  mode is\nenabled.\n/C0068Bit 1: MSR1 is the delta data set ready ( ΔDSR) bit. ΔDSR indicates that the DSR  input to the serial channel\nhas changed states since the last time it was read by the CPU.\n/C0068Bit 2: MSR2 is the trailing edge of ring indicator (TERI) bit. TERI indicates that the RI  input to the serial\nchannel has changed states from low to high since the last time it was read by the CPU. High-to-lowtransitions on RI do not activate TERI.\n/C0068Bit 3: MSR3 is the delta data carrier detect ( ΔDCD) bit. ΔDCD indicates that the DCD  input to the serial\nchannel has changed states since the last time it was read by the CPU.\n/C0068Bit 4: MSR4 is the clear-to-send (CTS) bit. CTS is the complement of the CTS  input from the modem\nindicating to the serial channel that the modem is ready to receive data from SOUT. When the serial channel\nis in the loop mode (MCR4 = 1), MSR4 reflects the value of RTS in the MCR.\n/C0068Bit 5: MSR5 is the data set ready DSR bit. DSR is the complement of the DSR  input from the modem to\nthe serial channel that indicates that the modem is ready to provide received data from the serial channelreceiver circuitry. When the channel is in the loop mode (MCR4 is set), MSR5 reflects the value of DTR in\nthe MCR.\nTL16C554A, TL16C554AI\nASYNCHRONOUS-COMMUNICATIONS ELEMENT\n/Em/Em\nSLLS509E − AUGUST 2001 − REVISED JUNE 2010\n29 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\nmodem-status register (MSR) (continued)\n/C0068Bit 6: MSR6 is the ring indicator (RI) bit. RI is the complement of the RIx  inputs. When the channel is in the\nloop mode (MCR4 is set), MSR6 reflects the value of OUT1 in the MCR.\n/C0068Bit 7: MSR7 is the data carrier detect (DCD) bit. Data carrier detect indicates the status of the data carrierdetect (DCD\n) input. When the channel is in the loop mode (MCR4 is set), MSR7 reflects the value of OUT2\nin the MCR.\nReading the MSR clears the delta modem status indicators but has no effect on the other status bits. For LSR\nand MSR, the setting of status bits is inhibited during status register read operations. If a status condition isgenerated during a read IOR\n operation, the status bit is not set until the trailing edge of the read. When a status\nbit is set during a read operation and the same status condition occurs, that status bit is cleared at the trailingedge of the read instead of being set again. In the loopback mode, CTS\n, DSR , RI, and DCD  inputs are ignored\nwhen modem-status interrupts are enabled; however , a modem-status interrupt can still be generated by writing\nto MCR3−MCR0. Applications software should not write to the MSR.\nTable 8.

These\ncontrol words define the character length, number of stop bits, parity, baud rate, and modem interface.\nWhile the control registers can be written in any order , the IER should be written last because it controls the\ninterrupt enables. Once the serial channel is programmed and operational, these registers can be updated any\ntime the ACE serial channel is not transmitting or receiving data.\nprogrammable baud-rate generator\nThe ACE serial channel contains a programmable baud-rate generator (BRG) that divides the clock (dc to8 MHz) by any divisor from 1 to 2\n16−1. Two 8-bit divisor-latch registers store the divisor in a 16-bit binary format.\nThese divisor-latch registers must be loaded during initialization. A 16-bit baud counter is immediately loadedupon loadi ng of either of the divisor latches. This prevents long counts on initial load. The BRG can use any of\nthree different popular frequencies to provide standard baud rates. These frequencies are 1.8432 MHz,3.072 MHz, 8 MHz, and 16 MHz. With these frequencies, standard bit rates from 50 kbps to 512 kbps areavailable. Tables 9, 10, 11, and 12 illustrate the divisors needed to obtain standard rates using these threefrequencies. The output frequency of the baud-rate generator is 16 times the data rate [divisor # = clock + (baud\nrate × 16)]. RCLK runs at this frequency.\nTL16C554A, TL16C554AI\nASYNCHRONOUS-COMMUNICATIONS ELEMENT\n/Em/Em\nSLLS509E − AUGUST 2001 − REVISED JUNE 2010\n30 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\nprogrammable baud-rate generator (continued)\nTable 9.

The ACE continually searches for a high-to-low\ntransition. W hen the transition is detected, a circuit is enabled to sample incoming data bits at the optimum point,\nwhich is the center of each bit. The start bit is valid when RXx is still low at the sample point. Verifying the start\nbits prevents the receiver from assembling a false data character due to a low-going noise spike on the RXx\ninput.\nThe number of data bits in a character is controlled by LCR0 and LCR1. Parity checking, generation, and polarity\nare controlled by LCR3 and LCR4. Receiver status is provided in the LSR. When a full character is received,including pa rity and stop bits, the data received indicator in LSR0 is set. In non-FIFO mode, the CPU reads the\nRBR, which clears LSR0. If the character is not read prior to a new character transfer from RSR to RBR, anoverrun occurs and the overrun error status indicator is set in LSR1. If there is a parity error, the parity error is\nset in LSR2. If a stop bit is not detected, a framing error indicator is set in LSR3.\nIn the FIFO mode, the data character and the associated error bits are stored in the receiver FIFO. If the data\nin RXx is a symmetrical square wave, the center of the data cells occurs within ±3.125% of the actual center,\nproviding an error margin of 46.875%. The start bit can begin as much as one 16 × clock cycles prior to being\ndetected.\nTL16C554A, TL16C554AI\nASYNCHRONOUS-COMMUNICATIONS ELEMENT\n/Em/Em\nSLLS509E − AUGUST 2001 − REVISED JUNE 2010\n33 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\nautoflow control (see Figure 20)\nAutoflow control is comprised of auto-CTS  and auto-RTS . With auto-CTS , the CTS  input must be active before\nthe transmitter FIFO can send data. With auto-RTS , RTS  becomes active when the receiver can handle more\ndata and notifies the sending serial device. When RTS  is connected to CTS , data transmission does not occur\nunless the receiver FIFO has space for the data; thus, overrun errors are eliminated using ACE1 and ACE2 from\na TL16C554A with the autoflow control enabled. Otherwise, overrun errors may occur when the transmit-datarate exceeds the receiver FIFO read latency.\nRCV\nFIFOSerial to\nParallel\nFlow\nControl\nXMT\nFIFOParallel\nto Serial\nFlow\nControlParallel\nto Serial\nFlow\nControl\nSerial to\nParallel\nFlow\nControlXMT\nFIFO\nRCV\nFIFOACE1 ACE2\nD7−D0SIN SOUT\nRTS CTS\nSOUT SIN\nCTS RTSD7−D0\nFigure 20. Autoflow Control (Auto-RTS  and Auto-CTS ) Example\nauto-RTS  (see Figure 20)\nAuto-RTS  data flow control originates in the receiver timing and control block (see functional block diagram)\nand is linked to the programmed receiver FIFO trigger level. When the receiver FIFO level reaches a trigger levelof 1, 4, or 8 (see Figure 22) RTS\n is deasserted. With trigger levels of 1, 4, and 8, the sending ACE may send\nan additional byte after the trigger level is reached (assuming the sending ACE has another byte to send)because it may not recognize the deassertion of RTS\n until after it has begun sending the additional byte. RTS\nis automatically reasserted once the RCV FIFO is emptied by reading the receiver-buffer register.\nWhen the trigger level is 14 (see Figure 23), RTS  is deasserted after the first data bit of the 16th character is\npresent on the SIN line. RTS  is reasserted when the RCV FIFO has at least one available byte space.\nauto-CTS  (see Figure 20)\nThe transmitter circuitry checks CTS  before sending the next data byte. When CTS  is active, it sends the next\nbyte. To stop the transmitter from sending the following byte, CTS  must be released before the middle of the\nlast st op bit currently being sent (see Figure 21). The auto-CTS  function reduces interrupts to the host system.\nWhen flow control is enabled, CTS  level changes do not trigger host interrupts because the device automatically\ncontrols its own transmitter. Without auto-CTS  the transmitter sends any data present in the transmit FIFO and\na receiver overrun error may result.\nenabling autoflow control and auto-CTS\nAutoflow control is enabled by setting modem-control register bits 5 (autoflow enable or AFE) and 1 (RTS) toa 1. Autoflow incorporates both auto-RTS\n and auto-CTS . When only auto-CTS  is desired, bit 1 in the modem-\ncontrol register should be cleared (this assumes that an external control signal is driving CTS ).\nTL16C554A, TL16C554AI\nASYNCHRONOUS-COMMUNICATIONS ELEMENT\n/Em/Em\nSLLS509E − AUGUST 2001 − REVISED JUNE 2010\n34 POST OFFICE BOX 655303 • DALLAS, TEXAS 75265PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\nauto-CTS  and auto-RTS  functional timing\nStart Bits 0−7 Start Bits 0−7 Start Bits 0−7 Stop Stop Stop SOUT\nCTS\nNOTES: A.

A high on RESET causes the following:\n1. Initializes the transmitter and receiver internal clock counters.\n2. Clears the LSR, except for transmitter register empty (TEMT) and transmit holding register empty (THRE),\nwhich are set. The MCR is also cleared. All of the discrete lines, memory elements, and miscellaneous logic\nassociated with these register bits are also cleared or turned off. The LCR, divisor latches, RBR, andtransmitter-buffer register are not affected.\nRXRDY  operation\nIn mode 0, RXRDY  is asserted (low) when the receive FIFO is not empty; it is released (high) when the FIFO\nis empty. In this way, the receiver FIFO is read when RXRDY  is asserted (low).\nIn mode 1, RXRDY  is asserted (low) when the receive FIFO has filled to the trigger level or a character time-out\nhas occurred (four character times with no transmission of characters); it is released (high) when the FIFO isempty. In this mode, many received characters are read by the DMA device, reducing the number of times itis interrupted.\nRXRDY\n and TXRDY  outputs from each of the four internal ACEs of the TL16C554A are ANDed together\ninternally. This combined signal is brought out externally to RXRDY  and TXRDY .\nFollowing the removal of the reset condition (RESET low), the ACE remains in the idle mode until programmed.\nA hardware reset of the ACE sets the THRE and TEMT status bits in the LSR. When interrupts are subsequently\nenabled, an interrupt occurs due to THRE. A summary of the effect of a reset on the ACE is given in Table 13.\nTable 13.
