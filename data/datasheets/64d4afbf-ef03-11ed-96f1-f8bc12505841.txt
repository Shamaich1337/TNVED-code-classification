They\nprovide up to 2-A output current.\nWith an input voltage range of 2.9 V to 6 V, the device\nis a perfect fit for power conversion from a 5-V or 3.3-\nV system supply rail. The TPS6206x operates at 3-\nMHz fixed frequency and enters power save mode\noperation at light load currents to maintain high\nefficiency over the entire load current range. The\npower save mode is optimized for low output voltage\nripple. For low noise applications, TPS62065 can be\nforced into fixed frequency PWM mode by pulling the\nMODE pin high. TPS62067 provides an open drain\npower good output.\nIn the shutdown mode, the current consumption is\nreduced to less than 1 µA and an internal circuit\ndischarges the output capacitor.\nTPS6206x family is optimized for operation with a tiny\n1 µH inductor and a small 10-µF output capacitor to\nachieve smallest solution size and high regulation\nperformance.\nIt is available in a small 2-mm × 2-mm × 0.75-mm 8-\npin WSON package.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE (1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS62065\nTPS62067WSON (8) 2.00 mm × 2.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the data sheet.\nPVIN\nPGNDEN\nFB\nPGL\n1.0 H/c109\nSW\nC\n10 FOUT\n/c109V\n1.8 V 2 AOUTV = 2.9 V to 6 VIN\nAVIN\nAGNDC\n22 pFffR\n100 kPG\n/c87\nR\n180 k2\n/c87R\n360 k1\n/c87C\n10IN\n/c109F\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nTypical Application Schematic\n50556065707580859095100\nEfficiency□-□%\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2\nI -□Load□Current□- ALV =□4.2□VINV =□5□VINV =□3.7□VIN\nL =□1.2 H□(NRG4026T□1R2),\nC =□22 F□(0603□size),\nV =□3.3□V,\nMode: Auto□PFM/PWM/c109\n/c109OUT\nOUT\nEfficiency vs Load Currentwww.ti.comTPS62065, TPS62067\nSLVS833E – MARCH 2010 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62065  TPS62067TPS62065, TPS62067\nSLVS833E – MARCH 2010 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

At light load currents the converter can automatically enter power\nsave mode and operates then in pulse frequency modulation (PFM) mode.\nDuring PWM operation the converter use a unique fast response voltage mode controller scheme with input\nvoltage feed-forward to achieve good line and load regulation allowing the use of small ceramic input and output\ncapacitors. At the beginning of each clock cycle initiated by the clock signal, the high-side MOSFET switch is\nturned on. The current flows now from the input capacitor through the high-side MOSFET switch through the\ninductor to the output capacitor and load. During this phase, the current ramps up until the PWM comparator\ntrips and the control logic will turn off the switch. The current limit comparator will also turn off the switch in case\nthe current limit of the high-side MOSFET switch is exceeded. After a dead time preventing shoot through\ncurrent, the low-side MOSFET rectifier is turned on and the inductor current ramps down. The current flows now\nfrom the inductor to the output capacitor and to the load. It returns back to the inductor through the low-side\nMOSFET rectifier..\nThe next cycle will be initiated by the clock signal again turning off the low-side MOSFET rectifier and turning on\nthe high-side MOSFET switch.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nZero-Pole\nAMP.IntegratorError Amp.PFM Comparator\nPWM\nComp.VREFControl\nStageGate Driver\nAnti\nShoot-ThroughCurrent\nLimit Comparator\nCurrent\nLimit ComparatorVREFFB\nSW\nENAVIN\nSoftstart\nVOUT RAMP\nCONTROLThermal\nShutdown\nReference\n0.6V VREFUndervoltage\nLockout 1.8VLimit\nHigh Side\nLimit\nLow Side\nSawtooth\nGeneratorFB\nAGNDInternal\nFB\nNetwork*PVIN\nPGND3MHz\nClock\nRDischargeVREFFB\nPGMODE/\nPG Comparator*MODE *\nPG\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n* Function depends on device optionwww.ti.comTPS62065, TPS62067\nSLVS833E – MARCH 2010 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 7\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62065  TPS62067\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Mode Selection (TPS62065)\nThe MODE pin allows mode selection between forced PWM mode and power save mode.\nConnecting this pin to GND enables the power save mode with automatic transition between PWM and PFM\nmode. Pulling the MODE pin high forces the converter to operate in fixed frequency PWM mode even at light\nload currents. This allows simple filtering of the switching frequency for noise sensitive applications. In this\nmode, the efficiency is lower compared to the power save mode during light loads.\nThe condition of the MODE pin can be changed during operation and allows efficient power management by\nadjusting the operation mode of the converter to the specific system requirements.\nIn device options where the MODE pin is replaced with power good output, the power save mode is enabled per\ndefault.\n8.3.2 Power Good Output (TPS62067)\nThis function is available in the TPS62067. The power good output is an open-drain output and requires an\nexternal pullup resistor. The circuit is active once the device is enabled and AVIN is above the undervoltage\nlockout threshold V UVLO. It is driven by an internal comparator connected to the FB voltage. The PG output\nprovides a high level once the feedback voltage exceeds typically 95% of its nominal value. The PG output is\ndriven to low level once the feedback voltage falls below typically 90% of its nominal value. The PG output is\nactivated with an internal delay of 5 µs.\nThe PG open-drain output transistor is turned on immediately with EN = Low level and pulls the output low. The\nexternal pullup resistor can be connected to any voltage rail lower or equal the voltage applied to AVIN of the\ndevice. The value of the pullup resistor must be carefully selected to limit the current into the PG pin to maximum\n1 mA. The external pullup resistor can be connected to VOUT or another voltage rail which does not exceed the\nVIN level. The current flowing through the pullup resistor impacts the current consumption of the application\ncircuit in shutdown mode.\nThe shutdown current of the device does not include the current through the external pullup and internal open-\ndrain stage. The PG signal can be used for sequencing various converters or to reset a microcontroller.\nEN\nVOUT\nPG95%\n90%StartupOverload\nOutput\ndischarge\ntStarttRamp\nWithEN□=□low\nPG□-->□low\nFigure 8-1. Power Good Output Pg\n8.3.3 Enable\nThe device is enabled by setting EN pin to high. At first, the internal reference is activated and the internal\nanalog circuits are settled. Afterwards, the soft start is activated and the output voltage is ramped up. The output\nvoltages reaches 95% of its nominal value within t START  of typically 500 µs after the device has been enabled.\nThe EN input can be used to control power sequencing in a system with various DC/DC converters. The EN pin\ncan be connected to the output of another converter, to drive the EN pin high and getting a sequencing of supply\nrails. With EN = GND, the device enters shutdown mode. In this mode, all circuits are disabled and the SW pin is\nconnected to PGND through an internal resistor to discharge the output.TPS62065, TPS62067\nSLVS833E – MARCH 2010 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62065  TPS62067\n8.3.4 Clock Dithering\nTo reduce the noise level of switch frequency harmonics in the higher RF bands, the TPS6206x family has a\nbuilt-in clock-dithering circuit. The oscillator frequency is slightly modulated with a sub clock causing a clock\ndither of typically 6 ns.\n8.3.5 Undervoltage Lockout\nThe undervoltage lockout circuit prevents the device from malfunctioning at low input voltages and from\nexcessive discharge of the battery. It disables the output stage of the converter once the falling V IN trips the\nundervoltage lockout threshold V UVLO. The undervoltage lockout threshold V UVLO for falling V IN is typically 1.78\nV. The device starts operation once the rising V IN trips undervoltage lockout threshold V UVLO again at typically\n1.95 V.\n8.3.6 Thermal Shutdown\nAs soon as the junction temperature, T J, exceeds 150°C (typical) the device goes into thermal shutdown. In this\nmode, the high-side and low-side MOSFETs are turned off. The device continues its operation with a soft start\nonce the junction temperature falls below the thermal shutdown hysteresis.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Soft Start\nThe TPS6206x has an internal soft start circuit that controls the ramp up of the output voltage. Once the\nconverter is enabled and the input voltage is above the undervoltage lockout threshold V UVLO the output voltage\nramps up from 5% to 95% of its nominal value within t Ramp of typically 250 µs.\nThis limits the inrush current in the converter during start-up and prevents possible input voltage drops when a\nbattery or high impedance power source is used.\nDuring soft start, the switch current limit is reduced to 1/3 of its nominal value I LIMF until the output voltage\nreaches 1/3 of its nominal value. Once the output voltage trips this threshold, the device operates with its\nnominal current limit I LIMF.\n8.4.2 Power Save Mode\nAt TPS62065 pulling the MODE pin low enables power save mode. In TPS62067 power save mode is enabled\nper default. If the load current decreases, the converter enters power save mode operation automatically. During\npower save mode the converter skips switching and operates with reduced frequency in PFM mode with a\nminimum quiescent current to maintain high efficiency. The converter positions the output voltage typically +1%\nabove the nominal output voltage. This voltage positioning feature minimizes voltage drops caused by a sudden\nload step.\nThe transition from PWM mode to PFM mode occurs once the inductor current in the low-side MOSFET switch\nbecomes zero, which indicates discontinuous conduction mode.\nDuring the power save mode the output voltage is monitored with a PFM comparator. As the output voltage falls\nbelow the PFM comparator threshold of V OUTnominal  +1%, the device starts a PFM current pulse. For this the\nhigh-side MOSFET switch will turn on and the inductor current ramps up. After the on-time expires the switch will\nbe turned off and the low-side MOSFET switch will be turned on until the inductor current becomes zero.\nThe converter effectively delivers a current to the output capacitor and the load. If the load is below the delivered\ncurrent the output voltage will rise. If the output voltage is equal or higher than the PFM comparator threshold,\nthe device stops switching and enters a sleep mode with typically 18 µA current consumption.\nIn case the output voltage is still below the PFM comparator threshold, further PFM current pulses will be\ngenerated until the PFM comparator threshold is reached. The converter starts switching again once the output\nvoltage drops below the PFM comparator threshold due to the load current.\nThe PFM mode is exited and PWM mode entered in case the output current can no longer be supported in PFM\nmode.www.ti.comTPS62065, TPS62067\nSLVS833E – MARCH 2010 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62065  TPS62067\n8.4.3 Dynamic Voltage Positioning\nThis feature reduces the voltage undershoots and overshoots at load steps from light to heavy load and vice\nversa. It is active in power save mode and regulates the output voltage 1% higher than the nominal value.

Power Save Mode Operation with Automatic Mode Transition\n8.4.4 100% Duty Cycle Low Dropout Operation\nThe device starts to enter 100% duty cycle mode as the input voltage comes close to the nominal output voltage.\nTo maintain the output voltage, the high-side MOSFET switch is turned on 100% for one or more cycles.\nWith further decreasing V IN the high-side MOSFET switch is turned on completely. In this case the converter\noffers a low input-to-output voltage difference. This is particularly useful in battery-powered applications to\nachieve longest operation time by taking full advantage of the whole battery voltage range.\nThe minimum input voltage to maintain regulation depends on the load current and output voltage, and can be\ncalculated as:\nVINmin = V Omax + I Omax × (R DS(on) max + R L) (1)\nwhere\n• I Omax = maximum output current\n• R DS(on) max = maximum P-channel switch R DS(on)\n• R L = DC resistance of the inductor\n• V Omax = nominal output voltage plus maximum output voltage tolerance\n8.4.5 Internal Current Limit and Fold-Back Current Limit for Short Circuit Protection\nDuring normal operation the high-side and low-side MOSFET switches are protected by its current limits I LIMF.\nOnce the high-side MOSFET switch reaches its current limit, it is turned off and the low-side MOSFET switch is\nturned on. The high-side MOSFET switch can only turn on again, once the current in the low-side MOSFET\nswitch decreases below its current limit I LIMF. The device is capable to provide peak inductor currents up to its\ninternal current limit ILIMF..\nAs soon as the switch current limits are hit and the output voltage falls below 1/3 of the nominal output voltage\ndue to overload or short circuit condition, the foldback current limit is enabled. In this case the switch current limit\nis reduced to 1/3 of the nominal value I LIMF.\nDue to the short circuit protection is enabled during start-up, the device does not deliver more than 1/3 of its\nnominal current limit I LIMF until the output voltage exceeds 1/3 of the nominal output voltage. This needs to be\nconsidered when a load is connected to the output of the converter, which acts as a current sink.TPS62065, TPS62067\nSLVS833E – MARCH 2010 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62065  TPS62067\n8.4.6 Output Capacitor Discharge\nWith EN = GND, the device enters shutdown mode and all internal circuits are disabled.

TPS62065 1.8-V Adjustable Output Voltage Configuration\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThe device operates over an input voltage range from 2.9 V to 6 V. The output voltage is adjustable using an\nexternal feedback divider.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n9.2.2.1 Output Voltage Setting\nThe output voltage can be calculated to:\n21OUT 1\nOUT REF 1 2\nREFV RV = V R = 1 RR V/c230 /c246 /c230 /c246/c180 /c43 /c45 /c180/c231 /c247 /c231 /c247\n/c232 /c248 /c232 /c248\n(2)\nwith an internal reference voltage V REF typically 0.6 V.\nTo minimize the current through the feedback divider network, R 2 should be within the range of 120 k Ω to 360\nkΩ. The sum of R 1 and R 2 should not exceed approximately 1 M Ω, to keep the network robust against noise. An\nexternal feed-forward capacitor C ff is required for optimum regulation performance. Lower resistor values can be\nused. R 1 and C ff places a zero in the loop.

Refer to the lists of inductors and capacitors. The device is optimized for a 1-µH inductor\nand 10-µF output capacitor.\n9.2.2.2.1 Inductor Selection\nThe inductor value has a direct effect on the ripple current. The selected inductor must be rated for its DC\nresistance and saturation current. The inductor ripple current ( ΔIL) decreases with higher inductance and\nincreases with higher V IN or V OUT.\nEquation 6  calculates the maximum inductor current in PWM mode under static load conditions. The saturation\ncurrent of the inductor should be rated higher than the maximum inductor current as calculated with Equation 7 .\nThis is recommended because during heavy load transient the inductor current rises above the calculated value.\nLVout1VinI VoutL ƒ/c45\n/c68 /c61 /c180/c180\n(6)\nL\nLmax outmaxII I2/c68/c61 /c43\n(7)\nwhere\n• f = Switching frequency (3 MHz typical)\n• L = Inductor value\n• ΔI L = Peak-to-peak inductor ripple current\n• I Lmax = Maximum inductor current\nA more conservative approach is to select the inductor current rating just for the switch current limit I LIMF of the\nconverter.\nThe total losses of the coil have a strong impact on the efficiency of the DC/DC conversion and consist of both\nthe losses in the DC resistance R (DC) and the following frequency-dependent components:\n• The losses in the core material (magnetic hysteresis loss, especially at high switching frequencies)\n• Additional losses in the conductor from the skin effect (current displacement at high frequencies)\n• Magnetic field losses of the neighboring windings (proximity effect)\n• Radiation losses\nTable 9-1.

TI recommends ceramic capacitors with low ESR values that have the lowest output voltage ripple.www.ti.comTPS62065, TPS62067\nSLVS833E – MARCH 2010 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62065  TPS62067\nThe output capacitor requires either an X7R or X5R dielectric. Y5V and Z5U dielectric capacitors, aside from\ntheir wide variation in capacitance over temperature, become resistive at high frequencies and may not be used.\nFor most applications a nominal 10-µF or 22-µF capacitor is suitable. At small ceramic capacitors, the DC-bias\neffect decreases the effective capacitance. Therefore a 22-µF capacitor can be used for output voltages higher\nthan 2 V, see list of capacitors.\nIn case additional ceramic capacitors in the supplied system are connected to the output of the DC/DC\nconverter, the output capacitor C OUT must be decreased in order not to exceed the recommended effective\ncapacitance range. In this case a loop stability analysis must be performed as described later.\nAt nominal load current, the device operates in PWM mode and the RMS ripple current is calculated as:\n1\n1\n2 3out\nin\nRMSCout outV\nVI VL ƒ/c45\n/c61 /c180 /c180/c180 /c180\n(8)\n9.2.2.2.3 Input Capacitor Selection\nBecause of the nature of the buck converter having a pulsating input current, a low ESR input capacitor is\nrequired for best input voltage filtering and minimizing the interference with other circuits caused by high input\nvoltage spikes. For most applications, TI recommends a 10-µF ceramic capacitor. The input capacitor can be\nincreased without any limit for better input voltage filtering.\nTake care when using only small ceramic input capacitors. When a ceramic capacitor is used at the input and the\npower is being supplied through long wires, such as from a wall adapter, a load step at the output or VIN step on\nthe input can induce ringing at the VIN pin. This ringing can couple to the output and be mistaken as loop\ninstability or could even damage the part by exceeding the maximum ratings.\nTable 9-2.

When the switching\nwaveform shows large duty cycle jitter or the output voltage or inductor current shows oscillations, the regulation\nloop may be unstable. This is often a result of board layout and/or wrong L-C output filter combinations. As a\nnext step in the evaluation of the regulation loop, the load transient response is tested. The time between the\napplication of the load transient and the turnon of the P-channel MOSFET, the output capacitor must supply all of\nthe current required by the load. V OUT immediately shifts by an amount equal to Δ I(LOAD)  x ESR, where ESR is\nthe effective series resistance of C OUT. ΔI(LOAD)  begins to charge or discharge C OUT generating a feedback error\nsignal used by the regulator to return V OUT to its steady-state value. The results are most easily interpreted when\nthe device operates in PWM mode at medium to high load currents.\nDuring this recovery time, V OUT can be monitored for settling time, overshoot, or ringing; that helps evaluate\nstability of the converter. Without any ringing, the loop has usually more than 45° of phase margin.TPS62065, TPS62067\nSLVS833E – MARCH 2010 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62065  TPS62067\n9.2.3 Application Curves\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2\nI -□Load□Current□- AL50556065707580859095100\nEfficiency□-□%V =□4.2□VINV =□5□VIN\nV =□3.6□VINV =□3.3□VINV =□3□VIN\nL =□1.2 H□(NRG4026T□1R2),\nC =□10 F□(0603□size),\nV =□1.2□V,\nMode: Auto□PFM/PWM/c109\n/c109OUT\nOUT\nFigure 9-2.

If the layout is not carefully done, the regulator could\nshow poor line and/or load regulation, stability issues as well as EMI and thermal problems. It is critical to\nprovide a low inductance, impedance ground path. Therefore, use wide and short traces for the main current\npaths. The input capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the IC pins as well as the inductor and\noutput capacitor.\nConnect the AGND and PGND pins of the device to the PowerPAD™ land of the PCB and use this pad as a star\npoint. Use a common power PGND node and a different node for the signal AGND to minimize the effects of\nground noise. The FB divider network should be connected right to the output capacitor and the FB line must be\nrouted away from noisy components and traces (for example, SW line).\nDue to the small package of this converter and the overall small solution size the thermal performance of the\nPCB layout is important. To get a good thermal performance, TI recommends a four or more Layer PCB design.\nThe PowerPAD™ of the IC must be soldered on the power pad area on the PCB to get a proper thermal\nconnection. For good thermal performance the PowerPAD™ on the PCB needs to be connected to an inner GND\nplane with sufficient via connections. Refer to the documentation of the evaluation kit.\n11.2 Layout Example\nVIN\nVOUTGND\nLCIN COUT\nR1 R2 CFF\nGNDEnableMode/PG\nFigure 11-1.
