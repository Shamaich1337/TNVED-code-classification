#### Description:
The VS-30BQ100-M3 is a high-performance Schottky rectifier designed for applications that require low forward voltage drop and compact size on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Schottky rectifiers are semiconductor devices that allow current to flow in one direction while blocking it in the opposite direction, making them ideal for rectification in power supply circuits.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Power Management:** Used in switching power supplies and converters to improve efficiency by reducing power loss.
- **Disk Drives:** Acts as a rectifier in power circuits for hard drives and SSDs.
- **Battery Charging:** Utilized in battery management systems for efficient charging.
- **Freewheeling Diodes:** Provides protection in inductive load circuits by allowing current to recirculate.
- **Reverse Battery Protection:** Prevents damage to circuits from incorrect battery connections.

This component is particularly suited for applications where space is limited and efficiency is critical, making it a popular choice in modern electronic designs.
