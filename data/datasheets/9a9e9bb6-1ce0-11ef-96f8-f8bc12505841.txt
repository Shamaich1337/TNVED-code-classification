The device supports \nboth fractional-N and integer-N modes, with a 32-bit \nfractional divider allowing fine frequency selection. \nIntegrated noise of 49 fs for 6-GHz output makes it an \nideal low-noise source. Combining best-in-class PLL \nand integrated VCO noise with integrated LDOs, this \ndevice removes the need for multiple discrete devices \nin high performance systems.\nThe device accepts input frequencies up to 1.4 \nGHz, which combined with frequency dividers and \nprogrammable low noise multiplier allows flexible \nfrequency planning. The additional programmable \nlow-noise multiplier lets users mitigate the impact \nof integer boundary spurs. In Fractional-N mode, \nthe device can adjust the output phase by a 32-bit \nresolution. For applications that need fast frequency \nchanges, the device supports a fast calibration option \nwhich takes less than 25 µs.\nThis performance is achieved by using single 3.3-V \nsupply. It supports 2 flexible differential outputs that \ncan be configured as single-ended outputs as well. \nUsers can choose to program one output from the \nVCO (or doubler)  and the second from the channel \ndivider. When not being used, each output can be \nmuted separately.\nPackage Information (1) \nPART NUMBER DESCRIPTION BODY SIZE (NOM)\nLMX2592RHAT\nLMX2592RHARVQFN (40) 6.00 mm × 6.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nVCO \ndoublerCharge \nPumpVtune \n(pin 35)Cpout \n(pin 12)\nRFoutAP\nSigma-Delta\nModulator\nN DividerOSCin \nDouberPost-R\nDividerMultiplierPre-R\nDividerϕVcc\nRFoutAM\nRFoutBPVcc\nPrescalerChannel \nDividerExternal Loop Filter\nPhase \nDetector\nOutput \nBufferOSCin \nBuffer\nSerial Interface\nControl SDI (pin 17)SCK (pin 16)CSB (pin 24)\nSDO / LD (pin 20)OSCinP \n(pin 8)\nOSCinM \n(pin 9)Input \nSignal\nRFoutBMMUXMUX\nMUX\nSimplified SchematicLMX2592\nSNAS646G  – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

Un-used \nside terminated with 50-Ω load.\n(3) There is internal voltage biasing so the OSCinM and OSCinP pins must always be AC-coupled (capacitor in series). Vppd is differential \npeak-to-peak voltage swing. If there is a differential signal (two are negative polarity of each other), the total swing is one subtracted \nby the other, each should be 0.1 to 1-Vppd. If there is a single-ended signal, it can have 0.2 to 2 Vppd. See the Application and \nImplementation  section for more information.\n(4) To use phase detector frequencies lower than 5-MHz set register FCAL_LPFD_ADJ = 3. To use phase detector frequencies higher \nthan 200 MHz, you must be in integer mode, set register PFD_CTL = 3 (to use single PFD mode), set FCAL_HPFD_ADJ = 3. For \nmore information, see the Detailed Description  section.\n(5) The PLL noise contribution is measured using a clean reference and a wide loop bandwidth and is composed into flicker and \nflat components. PLL_flat = PLL_FOM + 20 × log(Fvco/Fpd) + 10 × log(Fpd / 1Hz). PLL_flicker (offset) = PLL_flicker_Norm + 20 \n× log(Fvco / 1GHz) – 10 × log(offset / 10kHz). Once these two components are found, the total PLL noise can be calculated as \nPLL_Noise = 10 × log(10PLL_Flat / 10 + 10PLL_flicker / 10).\n(6) Not tested in production. Ensured by characterization. Allowable temperature drift refers to programming the device at an initial \ntemperature and allowing this temperature to drift without reprogramming the device, and still have the device stay in lock. This change \ncould be up or down in temperature and the specification does not apply to temperatures that go outside the recommended operating \ntemperatures of the device.\n(7) Not tested in production. Typical numbers from characterization with output settings: 50-Ω pullup, OUTA_POW = 15, channel divider \noff.\n(8) The is the calibration time from the time of FCAL_EN = 1 is triggered to the calibration algorithm completing and output at 7 GHz. A \nreference input signal of 100 MHz is used and register CAL_CLK_DIV = 0 for state machine clock to be 100 MHz. Faster calibration \ntimes can be achieve through changes of other register settings.

The output frequency \nrange is from 20 MHz to 9.5 GHz. The VCO core covers an octave from 3.55 to 7.1 GHz. The output channel \ndivider covers the frequency range from 20 MHz to the low bound of the VCO core. The VCO-doubler covers the \nfrequency range from the upper bound of the VCO to 9800MHz.\nThe input signal frequency has a wide range from 5 to 1400 MHz. Following the input, there is an programmable \nOSCin doubler, a pre-R divider (previous to multiplier), a multiplier, and then a post-R divider (after multiplier) for \nflexible frequency planning between the input (OSCin) and the phase detector.\nThe phase detector (PFD) can take frequencies from 5 to 200 MHz, but also has extended modes down to \n0.25 MHz and up to 400 MHz. The phase-lock loop (PLL) contains a Sigma-Delta modulator (1st to 4th order) \nfor fractional N-divider values. The fractional denominator is programmable to 32-bit long, allowing a very fine \nresolution of frequency step. There is a phase adjust feature that allows shifting of the output phase in relation to \nthe input (OSCin) by a fraction of the size of the fractional denominator.\nThe output power is programmable and can be designed for high power at a specific frequency by the pullup \ncomponent at the output pin.\nThe digital logic is a standard 4-wire SPI or uWire interface and is 1.8-V and 3.3-V compatible.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVCO \ndoublerCharge \nPump\nSigma-Delta\nModulator\nN DividerOSCin \nDouberPost-R\nDividerMultiplierPre-R\nDivider\nPrescalerChannel \nDividerMUXMUX\nMUXOSC_2X PLL_R_PRE PLL_R MULTCP_ICOARSE\nCP_IUP\nCP_IDN\nREF_EN\nVCO_2X_EN\nPLL_NPFD_DLY\nMASH_ORDER\nPLL_N_PREOUTx_PD\nOUTx_POWOUTx_MUXCHDIV_SEG1\nCHDIV_SEG2\nCHDIV_SEG3\nCHDIV_SEG_SEL\n7.3 Functional Description\n7.3.1 Input Signal\nAn input signal is required for the PLL to lock. The input signal is also used for the VCO calibration, so a proper \nsignal needs to be applied before the start of programming. The input signal goes to the OSCinP and OSCinM \npins of the device (there is internal biasing which requires AC-coupling caps in series before the pin). This is \na differential buffer so the total swing is the OSCinM signal subtracted by the OSCinP signal. Both differential \nsignals and single-ended signal can be used. Below is an example of the max signal level in each mode. It is \nimportant to have proper termination and matching on both sides (see Application and Implementation ).\nOSCin Buffer OSCinP (pin 8)\nOSCinM \n(pin 9)Differential Input Single-ended Input\n+0.5 V\n-0.5 V\n-0.5 V+0.5  V1 V\nVbias0.5 V\n-0.5 V\n-1 VVbias\nVbiasOSCin Buffer OSCinP (pin 8)\nOSCinM \n(pin 9)1 V\nVbias0.5 V\n-0.5 V\n-1 V1 V\nVbias0.5 V\n-0.5 V\n-1 V\nFigure 7-1.

The \nbest PLL noise floor is achieved with a 200-MHz input signal for the highest dual-phase detector frequency. \nTo address a wide range of applications, the input signal path contains the below components for flexible \nconfiguration before the phase detector. Each component can be bypassed. See Table 7-1  for usage boundaries \nif engaging a component.\n•OSCin doubler: This is low noise frequency doubler which can be used to multiply input frequencies by two. \nThe doubler uses both the rising and falling edge of the input signal so the input signal must have 50% duty \ncycle if enabling the doubler. The best PLL noise floor is achieved with 200-MHz PFD, thus the doubler is \nuseful if, for example, a very low-noise, 100-MHz input signal is available instead.\n•Pre-R divider: This is a frequency divider capable of very high frequency inputs. Use this to divide any input \nfrequency up to 1400-MHz, and then the post-R divider if lower frequencies are needed.\n•Multiplier: This is a programmable, low noise multiplier. In combination with the Pre-R and Post-R dividers, \nthe multiplier offers the flexibility to set a PFD away from frequencies that may create critical integer boundary \nspurs with the VCO and output frequencies. See the Application and Implementation  section for an example. \nThe user should not use the doubler while using the low noise programmable multiplier.\n•Post-R divider: Use this divider to divide down to frequencies below 5 MHz in extended PFD mode.\nTable 7-1. Boundaries for Input Path Components\nINPUT OUTPUT\nLOW (MHz) HIGH (MHz) LOW (MHz) HIGH (MHz)\nInput signal 5 1400\nOSCin doubler 5 200 10 400\nPre-R divider 10 1400 5 700\nMultiplier 40 70 180 250\nPost-R divider 5 250 0.25 125\nPFD 0.25 400\n7.3.3 PLL Phase Detector and Charge Pump\nThe PLL phase detector, also known as phase frequency detector (PFD), compares the outputs of the post-R \ndivider and N divider and generates a correction current with the charge pump corresponding to the phase error \nuntil the two signals are aligned in phase (the PLL is locked). The charge pump output goes through external \ncomponents (loop filter) which turns the correction current pulses into a DC voltage applied to the tuning voltage \n(Vtune) of the VCO. The charge pump gain level is programmable and allow to modify the loop bandwidth of the \nPLL.\nThe default architecture is a dual-loop PFD which can operate between 5 to 200 MHz. To use it in extended \nrange mode the PFD has to be configured differently:\n•Extended low phase detector frequency mode: For frequencies between 250 kHz and 5 MHz, low PFD mode \ncan be activated (FCAL_LPFD_ADJ = 3). PLL_N_PRE also needs to be set to 4.\n•Extended high phase detector frequency mode: For frequencies between 200 and 400 MHz, high PFD mode \ncan be activated (FCAL_HPFD_ADJ = 3). The PFD also has to be set to single-loop PFD mode (PFD_CTL = \n3). This mode only works if using integer-N, and PLL noise floor will be about 6-dB higher than in dual-loop \nPFD mode.\n7.3.4 N Divider and Fractional Circuitry\nThe N divider (12 bits) includes a multi-stage noise shaping (MASH) sigma-delta modulator with programmable \norder from 1st to 4th order, which performs fractional compensation and can achieve any fractional denominator \nfrom 1 to (232 – 1). Using programmable registers, PLL_N is the integer portion and PLL_NUM / PLL_DEN is the \nfractional portion, thus the total N divider value is determined by PLL_N + PLL_NUM / PLL_DEN. This allows the \noutput frequency to be a fractional multiplication of the phase detector frequency. The higher the denominator \nthe finer the resolution step of the output. There is a N divider prescaler (PLL_N_PRE) between the VCO and LMX2592\nSNAS646G – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMX2592\nthe N divider which performs a division of 2 or 4. 2 is selected typically for higher performance in fractional mode \nand 4 may be desirable for lower power operation and when N is approaching max value.\nFvco = Fpd × PLL_N_PRE × (PLL_N + PLL_NUM / PLL_DEN)\nMinimum output frequency step = Fpd × PLL_N_PRE / PLL_DEN / [Channel divider value]\nTypically, higher modulator order pushes the noise out in frequency and may be filtered out with the PLL. \nHowever, several tradeoff needs to be made. Table 7-2  shows the suggested minimum N value while in \nfractional mode as a function of the sigma-delta modulator order. It also describe the recommended register \nsetting for the PFD delay (register PFD_DLY_SEL).\nTable 7-2.

The frequency range of the VCO is from 3.55 to \n7.1 GHz so it covers one octave. Channel dividers allow the generation of all other lower frequencies. The \nVCO-doubler allow the generation of all other higher frequencies.  The output frequency of the VCO is inverse \nproportional to the DC voltage present at the tuning voltage point on pin Vtune. The tuning range is 0 V to 2.5 \nV. 0 V generates the maximum frequency and 2.5 V generates the minimum frequency. This VCO requires a \ncalibration procedure for each frequency selected to lock on. Each VCO calibration will force the tuning voltage \nto mid value and calibrate the VCO circuit. Any frequency setting in fast calibration occurs in the range of Vtune \npin 0 V to 2.5 V.  The VCO is designed to remained locked over the entire temperature range the device can \nsupport. Table 7-3  shows the VCO gain as a function of frequency.\nTable 7-3.

The frequency calibration \nroutine is activated any time that the R0 register is programmed with the FCAL_EN = 1. A valid input (OSCin) \nsignal to the device must present before the VCO calibration begins. To see how to reduce the calibration time, \nrefer to the Application and Implementation  section.\n7.3.7 VCO Doubler\nTo go above the VCO upper bound, the VCO-doubler must be used (VCO_2X_EN=1). The doubling block can \nbe enabled while the VCO is between 3.55 GHz (lowest VCO frequency) and 4.9 GHz. When VCO doubler is \nenabled, the N divider prescalar is automatically forced to divide by 4.www.ti.comLMX2592\nSNAS646G – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: LMX2592\n7.3.8 Channel Divider\nDivide by \n2 or 3Divide by \n2,4,6, or 8Divide by \n2,4,6, or 82\nCHDIV_SEG1 CHDIV_SEG2 CHDIV_SEG3CHDIV_SEG_SELMUX1\n4\nFigure 7-2.

The Multiplexer \n(programmed with register CHDIV_SEG_SEL) selects which divider is included in the path. The minimum \ndivision is 2 while the maximum division is 192. Un-used dividers can be powered down to save current \nconsumption. The entire channel divider can be powered down with register CHDIV_EN = 0 or selectively setting \nregisters CHDIV_SEG1_EN = 0, CHDIV_SEG2_EN = 0 ,CHDIV_SEG3_EN = 0.

Output Distribution Diagram\nFor each output A or B, there is a mux which select the VCO output directly or the channel divider output. \nBefore these selection MUX there are several buffers in the distribution path which can be configured depending \non the route selected. By disabling unused buffers, unwanted signals can be isolated and unneeded current \nconsumption can be eliminated.\n7.3.10 Output Buffer\nEach output buffer (A and B) have programmable gain with register OUTA_POW and OUTB_POW. The RF \noutput buffer configuration is open-collector and requires an external pullup from RFout pin to V CC. There are \ntwo pullup options that can be used with either resistor or inductor. Refer to the Application and Implementation \nsection for design considerations.\n1.Resistor pullup: placing a 50-Ω resistor pullup matches the output impedance to 50-Ω. However, maximum \noutput power is limited. Output buffer current settings should be set to a value before output power is \nsaturated (output power increases less for every step increase in output current value).\n2.Inductor pullup: placing an inductor pullup creates a resonance at the frequency of interest. This offers \nhigher output power for the same current and higher maximum output power. However, the output \nimpedance is higher and additional matching may be required..\n7.3.11 Phase Adjust\nIn fractional mode, the phase relationship between the output and the input can be changed with very fine \nresolution. Every time MASH_SEED register is written, it will trigger a phase shift of the amount described in \nEquation 1 . The seed value should be less then the fractional-N denominator register PLL_N_DEN. The actual \nphase shift can be obtained with the following equation:\nPhase shift (degrees) = 360 × MASH_SEED × PLL_N_PRE / PLL_N_DEN / [Channel divider value] (1)\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Power Down\nPower up and down can be achieved using the CE pin (logic HIGH or LOW voltage) or the POWERDOWN \nregister bit (0 or 1). When the device comes out of the powered-down state, either by pulling back CE pin HIGH \n(if it was powered down by CE pin) or by resuming the POWERDOWN bit to 0 (if it was powered down by \nregister write), it is required that register R0 be programmed again to re-calibrate the device.\n7.4.2 Lock Detect\nThe MUXout pin can be configured to output a signal that gives an indication for the PLL being locked. If lock \ndetect is enabled (LD_EN = 1) and the MUXout pin is configured as lock detect output (MUXOUT_SEL = 1), www.ti.comLMX2592\nSNAS646G – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: LMX2592\nwhen the device is locked, the MUXout pin output is a logic HIGH voltage, and when the device is unlocked, \nMUXout output is a logic LOW voltage.\n7.4.3 Register Readback\nThe MUXout pin can be programmed (MUXOUT_SEL = 0) to use register readback serial data output. Timing \nrequirements for MUXout to CLK follow the same specifications as Data to CLK in Timing Requirements . To read \nback a certain register value, use the following steps:\n1.Set the R/W bit to 1; the data field contents are ignored.\n2.Program this register to the device, readback serial data will be output starting at the 9th clock.\nData\n= IgnoredR/W\n= 1\n9th - 24thDATA\nCLK\nLEAddress\n7-bit\n1st2nd - 8th\nRead back register value\n16-bitMUXout\nFigure 7-4.

The address field ADDRESS \n(bits 22:16) is used to decode the internal register address. The remaining 16 bits form the data field DATA \n(bits 15:0). While CSB is low, serial data is clocked into the shift register upon the rising edge of clock (data is \nprogrammed MSB first). When CSB goes high, data is transferred from the data field into the selected register \nbank.\n7.5.1 Recommended Initial Power on Programming Sequence\nWhen the device is first powered up, the device needs to be initialized and the ordering of this programming \nis very important.

Spur Offset Frequency Example\nBased on Figure 8-1 , the most common spurs can be calculated from the frequencies. Note that the % is the \nmodulus operator and is meant to mean the difference to the closest integer multiple. Some examples of how to \nuse this operator are: 36 % 11 = 3, 1000.1 % 50 = 0.1, and 5023.7 % 122.88 = 14.38. Applying this concept, the \nspurs at various offsets can be identified from Figure 8-1 .\nTable 8-1.

Some may \nname this by the more dominant cause, while others would simply name by choosing the name that is near the \ntop of Table 8-1 .\n8.1.1.2 Spur Mitigation Techniques\nOnce the spur is identified and understood, there will likely be a desire to try to minimize them. Spurs and \nMitigation Techniques  gives some common methods.\nSpurs and Mitigation Techniques\nSPUR TYPE WAYS TO REDUCE TRADE-OFF\nOSCin1. Use PLL_N_PRE = 2\n2.

Also, \nlarger unequivalent fractions only sometimes \nwork\nSub-Fractional1. Use Dithering\n2. Use MASH seed\n3. Use Larger Equivalent Fractions\n4. Use Larger Unequivalent Fractions\n5. Reduce Modulator Order\n6. Eliminate factors of 2 or 3 in denominator (see AN-1879 \nFractional N Frequency Synthesis  (SNAA062)Dithering and larger fractions may increase \nphase noise. MASH_SEED can be set \nbetween values 0 and Fden, which changes \nthe sub-fractional spur behavior. This is a \ndeterministic relationship and there will be \none seed value that will give best result for \nthis spur.\n8.1.2 Configuring the Input Signal Path\nThe input path is considered the portion of the device between the OSCin pin and the phase detector, which \nincludes the input buffer, R dividers, and programmable multipliers. The way that these are configured can have \na large impact on phase noise and fractional spurs.\n8.1.2.1 Input Signal Noise Scaling\nThe input signal noise scales by 20 × log(output frequency / input signal frequency), so always check this to see \nif the noise of the input signal scaled to the output frequency is close to the PLL in-band noise level. When that \nhappens, the input signal noise is the dominant noise source, not the PLL noise floor.\nOffset (Hz)Phase Noise (dBc/Hz)\n-180-160-140-120-100-80-60-40-200\n100 1k 10k 100k 1M 10M\nD0015400 MHz output phase noise\n100 MHz input signal phase noise\n100 MHz input signal phase noise\nscaled to 5400 MHz\nFigure 8-2.

Phase Noise of 5.4-GHz Output With \nHigh-Noise Input Signal\n8.1.3 Input Pin Configuration\nThe OSCinM and OSCinP can be used to support both a single-ended or differential clock. In either \nconfiguration, the termination on both sides should match for best common-mode noise rejection. The slew \nrate and signal integrity of this signal can have an impact on both the phase noise and fractional spurs. Standard \nclocking types, LVDS, LVPECL, HCSL, and CMOS can all be used.\n8.1.4 Using the OSCin Doubler\nThe lowest PLL flat noise is achieved with a low-noise 200-MHz input signal. If only a low-noise input signal with \nlower frequency is available (for example a 100-MHz source), you can use the low noise OSCin doubler to attain \n200-MHz phase detector frequency. Because PLL_flat = PLL_FOM + 20 × log(Fvco/Fpd) + 10 × log(Fpd / 1Hz), \ndoubling Fpd theoretically gets –6 dB from the 20 × log(Fvco/Fpd) component, +3 dB from the 10 × log(Fpd / \n1Hz) component, and cumulatively a –3-dB improvement.LMX2592\nSNAS646G – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2022 www.ti.com\n32 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMX2592\nOffset (Hz)Phase Noise (dBc/Hz)\n-120-115-110-105-100-95-90-85-80\n100 1k 10k 100k 1M\nD008Input = 100M_PFD = 100M_VCO = 6000M\nInput = 100M_osc2x = 2_PFD = 200M\n_VCO = 6000MFigure 8-4. 100-MHz Input With OSCin Doubler\n8.1.5 Using the Input Signal Path Components\nThe ideal input is a low-noise, 200-MHz (or multiples of it) signal and 200-MHz phase detector frequency \n(highest dual PFD frequency). However, if spur mechanisms are understood, certain combinations of the R-\ndivider and Multiplier can help. Refer to the Optimization of Spurs  section for understanding spur types and their \nmechanisms first, then try this section for these specific spurs.\n8.1.5.1 Moving Phase Detector Frequency\nEngaging the multiplier in the reference path allows more flexibility in setting the PFD frequency. One example \nuse case of this is if Fvco % Fpd is the dominant spur. This method can move the PFD frequency and thus the \nFvco % Fpd.\nExample: Fvco = 3720.12 MHz, Fosc = 300 MHz, Pre-R divider = 5, Fpd = 60 MHz, Fvco%Fosc = 120.12 MHz \n(Far out), Fvco%Fpd = 120 kHz (dominant). There is a Fvco%Fpd spur at 120 kHz (refer to Figure 8-5 ).\nFigure 8-5. Fvco % Fpd Spur\nThen second case, using divider and multiplier, is Fpd = 53.57 MHz away from 120-kHz spur. Fvco = \n3720.12MHz, Fosc = 300MHz, Pre-R divider = 7, Multiplier = 5, Post-R divider = 4, Fpd = 53.57 MHz, \nFvco%Fosc = 120.12 MHz (Far out). Fvco % Fpd = 23.79 MHz (far out). There is a 20–dB reduction for the \nFvco % Fpd spur at 120 kHz (refer to Figure 8-6 ).www.ti.comLMX2592\nSNAS646G – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 33\nProduct Folder Links: LMX2592\nFigure 8-6. Moving Away From Fvco % Fpd Spur\n8.1.5.2 Multiplying and Dividing by the Same Value\nAlthough it may not seem like the first thing to try, the Fvco%Fosc and Fout%Fosc spur can sometimes be \nimproved engaging the OSC_2X bit and then dividing by 2. Although this gives the same phase detector \nfrequency, the spur can be improved.\n8.1.6 Designing for Output Power\nIf there is a desired frequency for highest power, use an inductor pullup and design for the value so that the \nresonance is at that frequency. Use the formula SRF = 1 / (2π× sqrt[L × C]).\nExample: C = 1.4 pF (characteristic). If maximum power is targeted at 1 GHz, L = 18 nH. If maximum power is \ntargeted at 3.3 GHz, L = 1.6 nH\nOutput Frequency (MHz)Output Power (dBm)\n-10-50510152025\n100 200 500 1000 2000 5000 9500\nD0061.6 nH pull-up\n18 nH pull-up\n50 : pull-up\nFigure 8-7.

There are several registers that can be programmed to speed up this \ntime.  Lock time consists of the calibration time (time required to calibrate the VCO to the correct frequency \nrange ) plus the analog settling time (time lock the PLL in phase and frequency ). For fast calibration set registers \nFCAL_FAST = 1 and ACAL_FAST = 1. Also set the calibration clock frequency [input reference frequency]  / \n2^CAL_CLK_DIV) to 200 MHz . The 20-µs range lock time can be achieved if the amplitude comparator delay is \nlow, set by register ACAL_CMP_DLY (5 in this example). If this is too low there is not enough time to make the \ndecision of VCO amplitude to use and may result in non-optimal phase noise. The other approach is to turn off \namplitude calibration with ACAL_EN=0, then manually choose the amplitude with VCO_IDAC (350 for example). \nThis will also result in 20-µs range calibration time. There are many other registers that can aid calibration time, \nfor example ACAL_VCO_IDAC_STRT lets the user choose what VCO amplitude to start with during amplitude \ncalibration. Setting this value to around 350 will give faster times because it is close to the final amplitude \nfor most final frequencies. FCAL_VCO_SEL_START allows you to choose the VCO core to start with for the \ncalibration instead of starting from core 7 by default. If you know you are locking to a frequency around VCO \ncore 1, you can start from VCO 2 by setting VCO_SEL=2, which should give faster lock times. Go to the Register \nMaps  section for detailed information of these registers and their related registers.  For fast analog settling time, \ndesign loop filter for very wide loop bandwidth (MHz range).\nFigure 8-8.

For the left screenshot \n(Wideband Frequency view), see the sweeping from top to bottom of the VCO range. On the right screenshot \n(Narrowband Frequency view), see the analog settling time to the precise target frequency.\n8.1.9 Modeling and Understanding PLL FOM and Flicker Noise\nFollow these recommended settings to design for wide loop bandwidth and extract FOM and flicker noise. The \nflat model is the PLL noise floor modeled by: PLL_flat = PLL_FOM + 20 × log(Fvco/Fpd) + 10 × log(Fpd / 1 \nHz). The flicker noise (also known as 1/f noise) which changes by –10dB / decade, is modeled by: PLL_flicker \n(offset) = PLL_flicker_Norm + 20 × log(Fvco / 1 GHz) – 10 × log(offset / 10k Hz). The cumulative model is the \naddition of both components: PLL_Noise = 10*log(10PLL_Flat / 10 + 10PLL_flicker / 10). This is adjusted to fit \nthe measured data to extract the PLL_FOM and PLL_flicker_Norm spec numbers.\nTable 8-3.

For the LMX 2592 , it matters what impedance is seen from the Vtune pin \nlooking outwards. This impedance is dominated by the component C3 for a third order filter or C1 for a second \norder filter. If there is at least 3.3 nF for the capacitance that is shunt with this pin, the VCO phase noise will be \nclose to the best it can be. If there is less, the VCO phase noise in the 100-kHz to 1-MHz region will degrade. \nThis capacitor should be placed close to the Vtune pin.LMX2592\nSNAS646G – DECEMBER 2015 – REVISED AUGUST 2022 www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LMX2592\nCPout\nVtune1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n1\n0\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n1836\n35\n34\n33\n32\n31\n3\n0\n2\n9\n2\n8\n2\n7\n2\n6\n2\n5\n2\n4\n2\n3\n2\n2\n2\n1201937383940\nC1\nC2R2R3C3Figure 8-10.

Phase noise inside the loop bandwidth is dominated by the PLL, while the phase noise \noutside the loop bandwidth is dominated by the VCO. As a rule of thumb, jitter is lowest if loop bandwidth is \ndesigned to the point where the two intersect. A higher phase margin loop filter design has less peaking at the \nloop bandwidth and thus lower jitter. The tradeoff with this as longer lock times and spurs should be considered \nin design as well.\n8.2.1.3 Application Curve\nFigure 8-12.
