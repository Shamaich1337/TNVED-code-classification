**Series:** FSMD2920 Series

#### Key Specifications:
- **Voltage Ratings:** Maximum Voltage (VMAX): 33V DC
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Hold Current (IH): 1.85A
  - Trip Current (IT): 3.70A
  - Maximum Current (IMAX): 100A
- **Power Consumption:** Typical Power Dissipation (Pd): 1.5W
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -40°C to 85°C
- **Package Type:** 2920 (Surface Mount)
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data, but typically follows JEDEC J-STD-020E standards for moisture sensitivity.
- **Special Features:**
  - RoHS Compliant & Halogen Free
  - Solid state with faster trip time compared to standard SMD devices
  - Designed for high-density boards

#### Description:
The FSMD185-2920-R is a surface mountable PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) resettable fuse designed to provide overcurrent protection in electronic circuits. It operates by increasing its resistance significantly when the current exceeds a certain threshold (trip current), thereby limiting the current flow and protecting the circuit from damage. Once the fault condition is removed, the fuse resets itself automatically, allowing normal operation to resume.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Power Management:** Used in power supply circuits to protect against overcurrent conditions.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Commonly found in devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops where space is limited and reliability is crucial.
- **Telecommunications Equipment:** Protects sensitive components in communication devices from overcurrent.
- **Automotive Applications:** Provides protection in automotive electronics against fault conditions.
- **Industrial Equipment:** Used in various industrial applications to safeguard against electrical faults.

This component is particularly suitable for applications where space is a constraint and where a reliable resettable protection mechanism is required.
