General description\nThe SA612A is a low-power VHF monolithic double-balanced mixer with on-board \noscillator and voltage regulator. It is in tended for low cost, low-power communication \nsystems with signal frequencies to 500 MHz and local oscillator frequencies as high as \n200 MHz. The mixer is a ‘Gilbert cell’ multiplier co nfiguration that provid es gain of 14 dB or \nmore at 45 MHz.\nThe oscillator can be configured for a crystal, a tuned tank operation, or as a buffer for an \nexternal LO. Noise figure at 45 MHz is typically below 6 dB and makes the device \nwell-suited for high-perform ance cordless phone/cellula r radio. The low power \nconsumption makes the SA612A excellent for battery-operated equipment. Networking \nand other communications products can benefit  from very low radiated energy levels \nwithin systems. The SA612A is available in an  8-lead SO (surface-mounted miniature \npackage).\n2.

Functional description\nThe SA612A is a Gilbert cell, an oscillator/ buffer, and a temperat ure-compensated bias \nnetwork as shown in Figure 3 . The Gilbert cell is a differen tial amplifier (IN_A and IN_B \npins) that drives a balanced switching cell. Th e differential input stage provides gain and \ndetermines the noise figure and signal  handling performance of the system.\n \nThe SA612A is designed for optimum low-power performance. When used with the \nSA614A as a 45 MHz cordless phone/cellular radio second IF and demodulator, the SA612A is capable of receiving \uf02d119 dBm signals with a 12 dB S/N ratio. Third-order \nintercept is typically \uf02d15 dBm (that is approximately +5 dBm output intercept because of \nthe RF gain). The system designer must be cogn izant of this large signal limitation. When \ndesigning LANs or other closed systems where transmission levels are high, and \nsmall-signal or signal-to-noise issues are not critical, the input to the SA612A should be \nappropriately scaled.\nBesides excellent low-power performance well into VHF, the SA612A is flexible. The input, \noutput and oscillator ports support various configurat ions provided the designer \nunderstands certain constraint s, which are explained here.\nThe RF inputs (IN_A and IN_B pins) are biased internally. They are symmetrical. The equivalent AC input impeda nce is approximately 1.5 k \uf057\uf07c \uf07c3 pF through 50 MHz. IN_A and \nIN_B pins can be used interchangeably, but they should not be DC biased externally. \nFigure 4\n shows three typical input configurations.Fig 3.

Each output is \nconnected to the internal  positive supply by a 1.5 k \uf057 resistor. This permits direct output \ntermination yet allows for balanced output as well.

The upper limit of operation is  determined by tank ‘Q’ and required drive \nlevels. The higher the ‘Q’ of the tank or th e smaller the required drive, the higher the \npermissible oscillation frequency. If the requir ed LO is beyond oscillation limits, or the \nsystem calls for an external LO, the external signal can be injected at OSC_B (pin 6) \nthrough a DC blocking capacitor. External LO should be 200 mV (peak-to-peak) minimum \nup to 300 mV (peak-to-peak) maximum.\nFigure 6  shows several proven oscillator circuits. Figure 6 a is appropriate for cordless \nphones or cellular radio. As shown, an overtone mode of operation is  utilized. Capacitor \nC3 and inductor L1 act as a fundamental trap. In fundamental mode oscillation, the trap is \nomitted.\n \nFigure 7  shows a Colpitts varactor tuned tank os cillator suitable for synthesizer-controlled \napplications. It is important to buffer the outp ut of this circuit to assure that switching \nspikes from the first counter or prescaler do not end up in the oscillator spectrum. The \ndual-gate MOSFET provides optimum isolation with low current. The FET offers good isolation, simplicity, and lo w current, while the bipolar transistors provide the simple \nsolution for non-critical applications. The resi stive divider in the emitter-follower circuit \nshould be chosen to provide the minimum in put signal that assures correct system \noperation.a.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n15.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n15.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n15.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhe sive and flux, clinching of leads, board \ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are \nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\nSA612A All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2014.

It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 7  and 8\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 17 .Table 7.
