Figure 1 \nshows how the MP3301  operates .  \nThe MP3301 regulates the SW voltage through \nthe feedback voltage and the 1.3MHz oscillator. \nAt the start of each oscillator cycle , the control \ncircuitry turns the FET on. A stabilizing ramp \nadded to the output of the current sense \namplifier prevent s sub-harmonic oscillations at \nduty cycles >50%: The ramp output goes to the  positive input of the PWM comparator : When  \nthis voltage equals the error amplifier output  \n(the amplified difference betwe en the 200mV \nreference voltage and the feedback voltage ), \nthe power FET turn s off.  \nWhen the feedback voltage starts to drop, the \noutput of the error amplifier increases , thus \nincreasing the current flowing through the \npower FET . The increased FET power re sults in \nincreased  power delivered to the output.  \n \nFigure 1: Functional Block Diagram  \nMP3301 —1.3MHZ , 700M A, FIXED -FREQUENCY , STEP -UP DRIVER  FOR WHITE LED S \n \n \nMP3301  Rev. 1.01 www.MonolithicPower.com  7 \n10/28/2013  MPS Proprietary Information.
