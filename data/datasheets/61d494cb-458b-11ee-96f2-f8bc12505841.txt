ADuM1251\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADuM1250/ADuM12511 are hot swappable digital isolators\nwith nonlatching, bidirectional communication channels that are\ncompatible with I2C interfaces. This eliminates the need for splitting\nI2C signals into separate transmit and receive signals for use with\nstandalone optocouplers.\nThe ADuM1250  provides two bidirectional channels, supporting\na complete isolated I2C interface. The ADuM1251  provides one\nbidirectional channel and one unidirectional channel for applications\nwhere a bidirectional clock is not required.\nBoth the ADuM1250  and the ADuM1251  contain hot swap circuitry\nto prevent glitching data when an unpowered card is inserted onto\nan active bus.These isolators are based on the iCoupler® chip scale transform-\ner technology from Analog Devices, Inc. iCoupler is a magnetic\nisolation technology with functional, performance, size, and power\nconsumption advantages as compared to optocouplers. With the\nADuM1250/ADuM1251 , iCoupler channels can be integrated with\nsemiconductor circuitry, which enables a complete isolated I2C\ninterface to be implemented in a small form factor.\n1Protected by U.S. Patents 5,952,849; 6,873,065; and 7,075,329.\nData Sheet ADuM1250/ADuM1251\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

J | 10 of 14Figure 5. Timing Test Diagram\nData Sheet ADuM1250/ADuM1251\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 11 of 14FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADuM1250/ADuM1251  interface on each side to a bidirectional\nI2C signal. Internally, the I2C interface is split into two unidirectional\nchannels communicating in opposing directions via a dedicated\niCoupler isolation channel for each. One channel (the bottom chan-\nnel of each channel pair shown in Figure 6 ) senses the voltage\nstate of the Side 1 I2C pin and transmits its state to its respective\nSide 2 I2C pin.\nBoth the Side 1 and the Side 2 I2C pins are designed to interface\nto an I2C bus operating in the 3.0 V to 5.5 V range. A logic low\non either pin causes the opposite pin to be pulled low enough\nto comply with the logic low threshold requirements of other I2C\ndevices on the bus. Avoidance of I2C bus contention is ensured\nby an input low threshold at SDA1 or SCL1 guaranteed to be at\nleast 50 mV less than the output low signal at the same pin. This\nprevents an output logic low at Side 1 being transmitted back to\nSide 2 and pulling down the I2C bus.\nBecause the Side 2 logic levels/thresholds are standard I2C values,\nmultiple ADuM1250/ADuM1251  devices connected to a bus by their\nSide 2 pins can communicate with each other and with other I2C\ncompatible devices. A distinction is made between I2C compatibility\nand I2C compliance. I2C compatibility refers to situations in which\nthe logic levels of a component do not necessarily meet the require-\nments of the I2C specification but still allow the component to\ncommunicate with an I2C compliant device. I2C compliance refers\nto situations in which the logic levels of a component meet the\nrequirements of the I2C specification.\nHowever, because the Side 1 pin has a modified output level/ input\nthreshold, this side of the ADuM1250/ADuM1251  can communicate\nonly with devices that conform to the I2C standard. In other words,\nSide 2 of the ADuM1250/ADuM1251  is I2C compliant, whereas Side\n1 is only I2C compatible.\nThe output logic low levels are independent of the VDD1 and\nVDD2 voltages. The input logic low threshold at Side 1 is also\nindependent of VDD1. However, the input logic low threshold at Side\n2 is designed to be at 0.3 VDD2, consistent with I2C requirements.\nThe Side 1 and Side 2 pins have open-collector outputs whose\nhigh levels are set via pull-up resistors to their respective supply\nvoltages.\nFigure 6. ADuM1250  Block Diagram\nSTARTUP\nBoth the VDD1 and VDD2 supplies have an undervoltage lockout\nfeature to prevent the signal channels from operating unless cer-tain criteria are met. This feature prevents input logic low signals\nfrom pulling down the I2C bus inadvertently during power-up/power-\ndown.\nFor the signal channels to be enabled, the following two criteria\nmust be met:\n►Both supplies must be at least 2.5 V.\n►At least 40 μs must elapse after both supplies exceed the\ninternal startup threshold of 2.0 V.\nUntil both criteria are met for both supplies, the ADuM1250 /AD-\nuM1251  outputs are pulled high, ensuring a startup that avoids any\ndisturbances on the bus. Figure 7  and Figure 8  illustrate the supply\nconditions for fast and slow input supply slew rates.\nFigure 7. Start-Up Condition, Supply Slew Rate > 12.5 V/ms\nFigure 8. Start-Up Condition, Supply Slew Rate < 12.5 V/ms\nTYPICAL APPLICATION DIAGRAM\nFigure 9  shows a typical application circuit including the pull-up\nresistors required for both Side 1 and Side 2 buses. Bypass capaci-\ntors with values from 0.01 µF to 0.1 µF are required between VDD1\nand GND1 and between VDD2 and GND2. The 200 Ω resistor shown\nin Figure 9  is required for latch-up immunity when hot plugging if\nthe ambient temperature is between 105°C and 125°C, and must\nbe placed on the side being hot plugged. Use 200 Ω for 5 V VDD1\nand 91 Ω for 3.3 V VDD1.\nData Sheet ADuM1250/ADuM1251\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 12 of 14Figure 9. Typical Isolated I2C Interface Using the ADuM1250\nCAPACITIVE LOAD AT LOW SPEEDS\nThe ADuM1250/ADuM1251  are designed for operation at speeds\nup to 1 Mbps. Due to the limited current available on Side 1,operation at 1 Mbps limits the capacitance that can be driven at the\nminimum pull-up value to 40 pF.\nMost applications operate at 100 kbps in standard mode or 400\nkbps in fast mode. At these lower operating speeds, the limitation\non the load capacitance can be significantly relaxed. Table 11\nshows the maximum capacitance at minimum pull-up values for\nstandard and fast operating modes. If larger values for the pull up\nresistor are used, the maximum supported capacitance must be\nscaled down proportionately so that the rise time does not increase\nbeyond the values required by the standard.\nTable 11.

J | 13 of 14MAGNETIC FIELD IMMUNITY\nThe ADuM1250/ADuM1251  are extremely immune to external mag-\nnetic fields. The limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the\nADuM1250/ADuM1251  is set by the condition in which induced\nvoltage in the receiving coil of the transformer is sufficiently large\nto either falsely set or reset the decoder. The following analysis\ndefines the conditions under which this may occur. The 3 V operat-\ning condition of the ADuM1250/ADuM1251  is examined because it\nrepresents the most susceptible mode of operation.\nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater\nthan 1.0 V. The decoder has a sensing threshold at approximately\n0.5 V, thus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages\ncan be tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is\ngiven by\nV = (−dβ/dt) ∑ πrn2; n = 1, 2, … , N (1)\nwhere:\nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss).\nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).\nN is the total number of turns in the receiving coil.\nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM1250  and the\nADuM1251  and an imposed requirement that the induced voltage\nbe, at most, 50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum\nallowable magnetic field is calculated as shown in Figure 10 .\nFigure 10. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux DensityFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum\nallowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a voltage of 0.25\u202f\u202fV\nat the receiving coil. This voltage is approximately 50% of the\nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition.\nSimilarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse (and\nis of the worst-case polarity), it reduces the received pulse from\n>1.0 V to 0.75 V, still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of the\ndecoder.\nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to specific\ncurrent magnitudes at given distances away from the ADuM1250 /\nADuM1251  transformers. Figure 11  expresses these allowable cur-\nrent magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected distances.\nAs shown in Figure 11  the ADuM1250/ADuM1251  are extremely\nimmune and can be affected only by extremely large currents\noperated at high frequency very close to the component. For the\n1 MHz example, a 0.5 kA current placed 5 mm away from the\nADuM1250/ADuM1251  is required to affect the operation of the\ncomponent.\nFigure 11. Maximum Allowable Current for Various Current-to- ADuM1250/\nADuM1251  Spacings\nNote that at combinations of strong magnetic field and high fre-\nquency, any loops formed by PCB traces can induce error voltages\nsufficiently large to trigger the thresholds of succeeding circuitry.\nExercise care in the layout of such traces to avoid this possibility.\nData Sheet ADuM1250/ADuM1251\nOUTLINE DIMENSIONS\n©2006-2023 Analog Devices, Inc.
