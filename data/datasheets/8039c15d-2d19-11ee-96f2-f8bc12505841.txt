Precautions\nPlease pa y\n attention to the following when you use this TFT LCD module \n10.1.\tMoun\nting\tPrecautions \t\n(1) You must mount a module using arr anged in four corners or four sides.\n(2) You should consider the mounting structure so  that uneven force (ex. Twisted stress) is\nnot applied to the module. And, the case on which a module is mounted should have\nsufficient strength so that ex ternal force is not transmitte d directly to the module.\n(1)\nPlease attach a transparent protective plat e to the surface in order to protect the\npolarizer.\nTransparent protective plate should have sufficient strength in or der to the resist external\nforce.(4) You should adopt radiation structure to  satisfy the temperat ure specification.\n(5) Acetic acid type and chlorine type materials for the cover case are not describe because\nthe former generates corrosive gas  of attacking the polarizer at high temperature and the\nlatter causes circuit break by electro-chemical reaction.(6) Do not touch, push or rub the exposed polarizer with glass,  tweezers or anything harder\nthan HB pencil lead. And please do not rub with dust clothes  with chemical treatment.\nDo not touch the surface of polarizer for bare hand or greasy cloth. (Some cosmetics are\ndetermined to the polarizer)\n(7) When the surface becomes dusty, please wi pe gently with adsorbent cotton or other soft\nmaterials like chamois soaks with petroleum benzene. Normal-hexane is recommended for\ncleaning the adhesives used to attach front / r ear polarizer. Do not use acetone, toluene\nand alcohol because they cause chemical damage to the polarizer.\n(8) Wipe off saliva or water drops as soon as po ssible. Their long time contact with polarizer\ncauses deformations and color fading.(9) Do not open the case because inside ci rcuits do not have sufficient strength.\n\n10.2\t Operating \tPrecautions \t\n(1) The spike noise causes the mis-operation of circuits. It should be lower than following\nvoltage: V=±200mV (Over and under shoot voltage)\n(2) Response time depends on the temperature. (I n lower temperature, it becomes longer.)\n(3) Brightness depends on the temperature. ( In lower tem perature, it becomes lower)\nAnd in lower temperature, response time (requir ed time that brightness is stable after turned\non) becomes longer.(2)Be careful for condensation at s udden temperature change.  Condensation makes\ndamage To polarizer or electrical  contacted parts. And after f ading condensation, smear or\nspot will oc\ncur.\n(5) When fixed patterns are displayed for a long time, remnant image is likely to occur. (6)\nModule has high frequency circuits. Suffici ent suppression to the electromagnetic\ninterference shall be done by system manufactu rers. Grounding and Shielding methods may\nbe important to minimize the interference.\n10.3\t Electrosta tic\tDischarge \tControl\t\nSince a module is composed of electronic circuits, it is not strong to electrostatic discharge. \nMake certain that treatment persons are connected to ground through wristband etc. \nAnd don’t touch interface pin dire ctly. \n10.4\t Precautions \tfor\tStro\nng\tLight\tExposure \t\nStrong light\n exposure causes degradation of polar izer and color filter. \n10.5\t Stor\nage\t\nWhen storing modules as spares for a long ti me, the following precautions are necessary. \n(1) Store them in a dark place.  Do not expose the module to s unlight or fluorescent light.\nKeep the temperature between 5 ℃ and \n35℃ at normal humidity.\n(2) The polarizer surface should not come in contact with any other object. It is recommend\ned that they be stored in the cont ainer in which they were shipped\n\n10.6\t Handling\t Precautions \tfor\tprotection \tfilm\t\n(1) When the protection film is peeled off, static  electricity is generated between the film and\npolarizer. This should be peeled off slowly and carefully  by people who are electrically\ngrounded and with well ion-blown equipment  or in such a condition,\n etc.\n(2) The protection film is attached to the polar izer with a small amount of glue. Is apt to\nremain on the polarizer. Please carefully peel o ff the protection film without rubbing it against\nthe polarizer.\n(3) When the module with protecti on film attached is stored for a long time, sometimes there\nremains a very small amount of gl ue still on the polarizer after t he protection film is peeled\noff.(4) You can remove the glue easily. When the glue remains on the polarizer surface or its\nvestige is recognized, please wipe them of f with absorbent cotton waste or other soft\nmaterial like chamois soaked with normal-hexane.\n\n11.
