General description\nThe 74CBTLV3126 provides a 4-bit high-speed bus switch with separate output enable inputs\n(1OE to 4OE). The low on-state resistance of the switch allows connections to be made with\nminimal propagation delay. The switch is disabled (high-impedance OFF-state) when the output\nenable (nOE) input is LOW.\nTo ensure the high-impedance OFF-state during power-up or power-down, nOE should be tied\nto the GND through a pull-down resistor. The minimum value of the resistor is determined by the\ncurrent-sinking capability of the driver.\nSchmitt trigger action at control input makes the circuit tolerant to slower input rise and fall times\nacross the entire V CC range from 2.3 V to 3.6 V.\nThis device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry\ndisables the output, preventing the damaging backflow current through the device when it is\npowered down.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Supply voltage range from 2.3 V to 3.6 V\n•Standard ’126’-type pinout\n•High noise immunity\n•Complies with JEDEC standard:\n•JESD8-5 (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n•JESD8-B/JESD36 (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM JESD22-A114F exceeds 2000 V\n•MM JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•CDM AEC-Q100-011 revision B exceeds 1000 V\n•5 Ω switch connection between two ports\n•Rail to rail switching on data I/O ports\n•CMOS low power consumption\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 250 mA per JESD78B Class I level A\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial Power-down mode operation\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\nNexperia 74CBTLV3126\n4-bit bus switch\n3.

#### Description:
The **74CBTLV3126** is a **4-bit bus switch** designed for high-speed data transmission with minimal propagation delay. It features separate output enable inputs (1OE to 4OE) that allow for individual control of each switch. The device is characterized by low on-state resistance, which facilitates efficient connections between ports while maintaining signal integrity. The switch enters a high-impedance OFF-state when the output enable (nOE) input is LOW, ensuring no signal interference during power transitions.

#### Typical Applications:
The 74CBTLV3126 is commonly used in:
- **Data Routing:** Connecting multiple data lines in applications such as multiplexing and demultiplexing.
- **Signal Switching:** Enabling or disabling signal paths in communication systems.
- **Power Management:** Allowing for controlled power distribution in battery-operated devices.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Used in devices requiring high-speed data transfer, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers.

This component is ideal for applications that require reliable switching with low power consumption and high noise immunity, making it suitable for both consumer and industrial electronics.
