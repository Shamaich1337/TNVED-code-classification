External power-management devices,\nsuch astheTPS2044, arerequired tocontrol the5-Vpower source switching (on/off) tothedownstream ports\nand todetect anovercurrent condition from thedownstream ports individually organged. Outputs from external\npower devices provide overcurrent inputs totheTUSB2036 OVRCUR pins incase ofanovercurrent condition,\nthecorresponding PWRON pins aredisabled bytheTUSB2036. Intheganged mode, allPWRON signals\ntransition simultaneously, and anyOVRCUR input canbeused. Inthenonganged mode, thePWRON outputs\nandOVRCUR inputs operate onaper-port basis.\nBoth bus-powered andself-powered hubs require overcurrent protection foralldownstream ports. The twotypes\nofprotection areindividual-port management (individual-port basis) organged-port management (multiple-port\nbasis). Individual-port management requires power-management devices foreach individual downstream port,\nbutadds robustness totheUSB system because, intheevent ofanovercurrent condition, theUSB host only\npowers down theport that hasthecondition. The ganged configuration uses fewer power management devices\nandthus haslower system costs, butintheevent ofanovercurrent condition onanyofthedownstream ports, all\ntheganged ports aredisabled bytheUSB host.\nUsing acombination oftheBUSPWR and EEDATA/ GANGED inputs, theTUSB2036 supports four modes of\npower management: bus-powered hub with either individual-port power management organged-port power\nmanagement, and theself-powered hub with either individual-port power management organged-port power\nmanagement. Texas Instruments supplies thecomplete hubsolution because weoffer thisTUSB2036 along with\nthepower-management devices needed toimplement afully USB compliant system.\n8.3.2 Clock Generation\nThe TUSB2036 provides theflexibility ofusing either a6-MHz ora48-MHz clock. The logic level oftheMODE\npincontrols theselection oftheclock source. When MODE islow, theoutput oftheinternal APLL circuitry is\nselected todrive theinternal core ofthechip. When MODE ishigh, theXTAL1 input isselected astheinput\nclock source and theAPLL circuitry ispowered down and bypassed. The internal oscillator cellisalso powered\ndown while MODE ishigh. For6-MHz operation, TUSB2036 requires a6-MHz clock signal onXTAL1 pin(with\nXTAL2 foracrystal) from which itsinternal APLL circuitry generates a48-MHz internal clock tosample thedata\nfrom theupstream port. For48-MHz operation, theclock cannot begenerated with acrystal, using theXTAL2\noutput, since theinternal oscillator cellonly supports thefundamental frequency. Iflow-power suspend and\nresume aredesired, apassive crystal orresonator must beused, although thehub supports theflexibility of\nusing anydevice thatgenerates a6-MHz clock. Because most oscillators cannot bestopped while power ison,\ntheir use prohibits low-power suspend, which depends ondisabling theclock. When theoscillator isused, by\nconnecting itsoutput totheXTAL1 pinandleaving theXTAL2 pinopen, itsTTL output level cannot exceed 3.6V.\nIfa6-MHz oscillator isused, itmust bestopped atlogic lowwhenever SUSPND ishigh.

After system power-on reset, theTUSB2036 performs aone-time access\nread operation from theEEPROM iftheEXTMEM pinispulled lowand thechip select(s) oftheEEPROM is\nconnected tothesystem power-on reset. Initially, theEEDATA pinisdriven bytheTUSB2036 tosend astart bit\n(1)which isfollowed bytheread instruction (10) and thestarting-word address (00000). Once theread\ninstruction isreceived, theinstruction and address aredecoded bytheEEPROM, which then sends thedata to\ntheoutput shift register. Atthispoint, thehub stops driving theEEDATA pinand theEEPROM starts driving. A\ndummy (0)bitisthen output andthefirstthree 16-bit words intheEEPROM areoutput with themost significant\nbit(MSB) first.\nThe output data changes aretriggered bytherising edge oftheclock provided bytheTUSB2036 ontheEECLK\npin.The SGS-Thompson M936C46 EEPROM isrecommended because itadvances tothenext memory location\nbyautomatically incrementing theaddress internally.

TI’scustomers are\nresponsible fordetermining suitability ofcomponents fortheir purposes. Customers should\nvalidate andtesttheir design implementation toconfirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nAmajor advantage ofUSB istheability toconnect 127 functions configured inupto6logical layers (tiers) toa\nsingle personal computer.\nAnother advantage ofUSB isthat allperipherals areconnected using astandardized four-wire cable that\nprovides both communication and power distribution. The power configurations are bus-powered and self-\npowered modes. The maximum current that may bedrawn from theUSB 5-Vlineduring power upis100 mA.\nForthebus-powered mode, ahub candraw amaximum of500 mAfrom the5-VlineoftheUSB cable. Abus-\npowered hubmust always beconnected downstream toaself-powered hubunless itistheonly hubconnected\ntothePCandthere arenohigh-powered functions connected downstream. Intheself-powered mode, thehubis\nconnected toanexternal power supply and cansupply upto500 mAtoeach downstream port. High-powered\nfunctions may draw amaximum of500mAfrom each downstream port andmay only beconnected downstream\ntoself-powered hubs. PertheUSB specification, inthebus-powered mode, each downstream port canprovide a\nmaximum of100mAofcurrent, andintheself-powered mode, each downstream port canprovide amaximum of\n500mAofcurrent.\nBoth bus-powered andself-powered hubs require overcurrent protection foralldownstream ports. The twotypes\nofprotection areindividual-port management (individual-port basis) organged-port management (multiple-port\nbasis). Individual-port management requires power-management devices foreach individual downstream port,\nbutadds robustness totheUSB system because, intheevent ofanovercurrent condition, theUSB host only\npowers down theport that hasthecondition. The ganged configuration uses fewer power management devices\nandthus haslower system costs, butintheevent ofanovercurrent condition onanyofthedownstream ports, all\ntheganged ports aredisabled bytheUSB host.\nUsing acombination oftheBUSPWR and EEDATA/ GANGED inputs, theTUSB2036 supports four modes of\npower management: bus-powered hub with either individual-port power management organged-port power\nmanagement, and theself-powered hub with either individual-port power management organged-port power\nmanagement. Texas Instruments supplies thecomplete hubsolution because weoffer thisTUSB2036 along with\nthepower-management devices needed toimplement afully USB compliant system.\nNote, even though noresistors areshown inthefollowing applications, pullup, pulldown, and series resistors\nmust beused toproperly implement thisdevice.\n16TUSB2036\nSLLS372I –MARCH 2000 –REVISED MARCH 2017 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: TUSB2036Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2000 –2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated9.2 Typical Application\nAcommon application fortheTUSB2036 isasaself-powered USB hub product.

This power railcanbe\nisolated from allother power rails byaferrite bead toreduce noise.\n•Allpower rails require a10-μFcapacitor or1-μFcapacitors forstability and noise immunity. These bulk\ncapacitors canbeplaced anywhere onthepower rail.The smaller decoupling capacitors should beplaced as\nclose totheTUSB2036 power pins aspossible with anoptimal grouping oftwoofdiffering values perpin.\n10.2 Downstream Port Power\n•The downstream port power, VBUS, must besupplied byasource capable ofsupplying 5Vand upto500\nmAperport. Downstream port power switches canbecontrolled bytheTUSB2036 signals. Itisalso possible\ntoleave thedownstream port power always enabled.\n•Alarge bulk low-ESR capacitor of22μForlarger isrequired oneach downstream port’sVBUS tolimit in-rush\ncurrent.\n•The ferrite beads ontheVBUS pins ofthedownstream USB port connections arerecommended forboth\nESD andEMI reasons. A0.1μFcapacitor ontheUSB connector side oftheferrite provides alowimpedance\npath toground forfastrisetime ESD current thatmight have coupled onto theVBUS trace from thecable.\n11Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\n11.1.1 Placement\n1.A0.1µFshould beplaced asclose aspossible onVCC power pin.\n2.The ESD andEMI protection devices (ifused) should also beplaced aspossible totheUSB connector.\n3.Ifacrystal isused, itmust beplaced asclose aspossible totheTUSB2036 ’sXTAL1 andXTAL2 pins.\n4.Place voltage regulators asfaraway aspossible from theTUSB2036, thecrystal, andthedifferential pairs.\n5.5.Ingeneral, thelarge bulk capacitors associated with thepower railshould beplaced asclose aspossible\ntothevoltage regulators.\n11.1.2 Differential Pairs\n1.Must bedesigned with adifferential impedance of90Ω±10%.\n2.Route alldifferential pairs onthesame layer adjacent toasolid ground plane.\n3.Donotroute differential pairs over anyplane split.\n4.Adding testpoints willcause impedance discontinuity andwilltherefore negative impact signal performance.\nIftest points areused, they should beplaced inseries and symmetrically. They must notbeplaced ina\nmanner thatcauses stub onthedifferential pair.\n5.Avoid 90degree turns intrace. The useofbends indifferential traces should bekept toaminimum. When\nbends areused, thenumber ofleftandright bends should beasequal aspossible andtheangle ofthebend\nshould be≥135 degrees. This willminimize any length mismatch causes bythebends and therefore\nminimize theimpact bends have onEMI.\n6.Minimize thetrace lengths ofthedifferential pair traces. The maximum recommended trace length forUSB\n2.0differential pairsignals iseight inches. Longer trace lengths require very careful routing toassure proper\nsignal integrity.\n7.Match theetch lengths ofthedifferential pairtraces. The USB 2.0differential pairs should notexceed 50mils\nrelative trace length difference.\n8.Minimize theuseofvias inthedifferential pairpaths asmuch aspossible. Ifthisisnotpractical, make sure\nthatthesame viatype andplacement areused forboth signals inapair. Any vias used should beplaced as\nclose aspossible totheTUSB2036 device.\n9.Donotplace power fuses across thedifferential pairtraces.\n20TUSB2036\nSLLS372I –MARCH 2000 –REVISED MARCH 2017 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: TUSB2036Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2000 –2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedLayout Guidelines (continued)\n11.1.3 Ground\nItisrecommended thatonly oneboard ground plane beused inthedesign.
