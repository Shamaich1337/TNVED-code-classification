As such, the COMP terminal can both source and sink\ncurrent. However, the error amplifier is internally current-limited, so the user can\ncommand zero duty cycle by externally forcing COMP to GND.\nThe UCC280x family features built-in full-cycle soft start. Soft start is\nimplemented as a clamp on the maximum COMP voltage.www.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nPIN\nI/O DESCRIPTION\nNAME SOIC\nCS 3 ICS is the input to the current sense comparators. The UCC280x family has two\ndifferent current sense comparators: the PWM comparator and an overcurrent\ncomparator.\nThe UCC280x family contains digital current sense filtering, which disconnects\nthe CS terminal from the current sense comparator during the 100-ns interval\nimmediately following the rising edge of the OUT pin. This digital filtering, also\ncalled leading-edge blanking, means that in most applications, no analog filtering\n(RC filter) is required on CS. Compared to an external RC filter technique, the\nleading-edge blanking provides a smaller effective CS to OUT propagation delay.\nNote, however, that the minimum non-zero On-time of the OUT signal is directly\naffected by the leading-edge-blanking and the CS to OUT propagation delay.\nThe overcurrent comparator is only intended for fault sensing, and exceeding the\novercurrent threshold causes a soft-start cycle.\nFB 2 IFB is the inverting input of the error amplifier. For best stability, keep FB lead\nlength as short as possible and FB stray capacitance as small as possible.\nGND 5 — GND is reference ground and power ground for all functions on this part.\nNC — — No connection pins\nOUT 6 OOUT is the output of a high-current power driver capable of driving the gate of a\npower MOSFET with peak currents exceeding ±750 mA. OUT is actively held low\nwhen VCC is below the UVLO threshold.\nThe high-current power driver consists of FET output devices, which can switch\nall of the way to GND and all of the way to V CC. The output stage also provides a\nvery low impedance to overshoot and undershoot. This means that in many\ncases, external schottky clamp diodes are not required.\nPWR GND — — Power ground of the IC\nRC 4 IRC is the oscillator timing pin. For fixed frequency operation, set timing capacitor\ncharging current by connecting a resistor from REF to RC. Set frequency by\nconnecting a timing capacitor from RC to GND. For best performance, keep the\ntiming capacitor lead to GND as short and direct as possible. If possible, use\nseparate ground traces for the timing capacitor and all other functions.\nThe frequency of oscillation can be estimated with the following equations:\n1.5\nR C/c61/c180f\n(1)\n1.0\nR C/c61/c180f\n(2)\nwhere\n• frequency is in Hz\n• resistance is in Ω\n• capacitance is in farads\nThe recommended range of timing resistors is between 10 k and 200 k, and\ntiming capacitor is 100 pF to 1000 pF. Never use a timing resistor less than 10 k.UCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020 www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nPIN\nI/O DESCRIPTION\nNAME SOIC\nREF 8 OREF is the voltage reference for the error amplifier, and also for many other\nfunctions on the IC. REF is also used as the logic power supply for high-speed\nswitching logic on the IC.\nWhen VCC is greater than 1 V and less than the UVLO threshold, REF is pulled\nto ground through a 5-kΩ resistor. This means that REF can be used as a logic\noutput indicating power system status. It is important for reference stability that\nREF is bypassed to GND with a ceramic capacitor as close to the pin as\npossible. An electrolytic capacitor may also be used in addition to the ceramic\ncapacitor. A minimum of 0.1-μF ceramic is required. Additional REF bypassing is\nrequired for external loads greater than 2.5 mA on the reference.\nTo prevent noise problems with high speed switching transients, bypass REF to\nground with a ceramic capacitor very close to the IC package.\nVCC 7 IVCC is the power input connection for this device. In normal operation, VCC is\npowered through a current limiting resistor. Although quiescent VCC current is\nvery low, total supply current is higher depending on OUT current. Total VCC\ncurrent is the sum of quiescent VCC current and the average OUT current.\nKnowing the operating frequency and the MOSFET gate charge (Q g), average\nOUT current can be calculated from:\nOUT gI Q /c61 /c180 f\n(3)\nTo prevent noise problems, bypass VCC to GND with a ceramic capacitor as\nclose to the VCC pin as possible. An electrolytic capacitor may also be used in\naddition to the ceramic capacitor. There must be a minimum of 1 µF in parallel\nwith a 0.1-µF ceramic capacitor from VCC to ground placed close to the device.www.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 5\n8 Specifications\n8.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nover operating free-air temperature range (unless otherwise noted)(1) (2)\nMIN MAX UNIT\nVCC voltage(3)12 V\nVCC current(3)30 mA\nOUT current ±1 A\nOUT energy (capacitive load) 20 µJ\nAnalog inputs (FB, CS, RC, COMP) –0.3 6.3 or VCC + 0.3(4)V\nPower dissipation at T A < 25°CN or J package 1\nW D package 0.65\nL package 1.375\nLead temperature, soldering (10 s) 300 °C\nStorage Temperature, T stg –65 150 °C\nJunction Temperature, T J -55 150 °C\n(1) All voltages are with respect to GND.

However, they\nare not plug-in compatible. In general, the UCC280x requires fewer external components and consumes less\noperating current.\n9.3.1 Detailed Pin Description\n9.3.1.1 COMP\nUnlike other devices, the error amplifier in the UCC280x family is a true, low output impedance, 2-MHz\noperational amplifier. As such, the COMP terminal can both source and sink current. However, the error amplifier\nis internally current-limited, so that one can command zero duty cycle by externally forcing COMP to GND.\nThe UCC280x has a true low output impedance error amplifier which both sources and sinks current. The error\namplifier associated with the UC3842 family is an open collector in parallel with a current source.\nThe UCC280x has power-up soft start and fault soft start built on-chip with a fixed COMP rise time to 5 V in\n4 ms. Therefore, no external soft-start circuitry is required, saving 1 resistor, 1 capacitor, and 1 PNP transistor.\n9.3.1.2 FB\nFB is the inverting input of the error amplifier. For best stability, keep FB lead length as short as possible and FB\nstray capacitance as small as possible.\nThe UCC280x features a 2-MHz bandwidth error amplifier versus 1 MHz on the UC3842 family. Feedback\ntechniques are identical to the UC3842 family.\n9.3.1.3 CS\nCS is the PWM comparator and an overcurrent comparator. The UCC280x family contains digital current sense\nfiltering, which disconnects the CS terminal from the current sense comparator during the 100-ns interval\nimmediately following the rising edge of the OUT pin. This digital filtering, also called leading-edge blanking,\nmeans that in most applications, no analog filtering (RC filter) is required on CS. Compared to an external RC\nfilter technique, the leading-edge blanking provides a smaller effective CS to OUT propagation delay. Note,\nhowever, that the minimum non-zero on-time of the OUT signal is directly affected by the leading-edge-blanking\nand the CS to OUT propagation delay. The overcurrent comparator is only intended for fault sensing, and\nexceeding the overcurrent threshold causes a soft-start cycle.\nThe UCC280x current sense is significantly different from its predecessor. The UC3842 family current sense\ninput connects to only the PWM comparator. The UCC280x current sense input connects to two comparators:\nthe PWM comparator and the overcurrent comparator. Internal leading edge blanking masks the first 100 ns of\nthe current sense signal. This may eliminate the requirement for an RC current sense filter and prevent false\ntriggering due to leading edge noises. Connect CS directly to MOSFET source current sense resistor. The gain\nof the current sense amplifier on the UCC280x family is typically 1.65 V/V versus typically 3 V/V with the UC3842\nfamily.\n9.3.1.4 RC\nRC is the oscillator timing pin. For fixed frequency operation, set timing capacitor charging current by connecting\na resistor from REF to RC. Set frequency by connecting timing capacitor from RC to GND. For the best\nperformance, keep the timing capacitor lead to GND as short and direct as possible. If possible, use separate\nground traces for the timing capacitor and all other functions.\nThe UCC280x’s oscillator allows for operation to 1 MHz versus 500 kHz with the UC3842 family. Both devices\nmake use of an external resistor to set the charging current for the capacitor, which determines the oscillator\nfrequency. For the UCC2802 and UCC2804, use Equation 4 .\n1.5\nR C/c61/c180f\n(4)\nFor the UCC2803 and UCC2805, use Equation 5 .UCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n1.0\nR C/c61/c180f(5)\nIn these two equations, switching frequency (f) is in Hz, R is in Ω, and C is in farads.\nThe two equations are different due to different reference voltages. The recommended range of timing resistor\nvalues is between 10 kΩ and 200 kΩ; the recommended range of timing capacitor values is between 100 pF and\n1000 pF. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the oscillator waveform is 2.45 V versus 1.7 V in UC3842 family. For\nbest performance, keep the timing capacitor lead to GND as short as possible. TI recommends separate ground\ntraces for the timing capacitor and all other pins. The maximum duty cycle for the UCC2802 and UCC2803 is\napproximately 99%; the maximum duty cycle for the UCC2803 and UCC2804 is approximately 49%. The duty\ncycle cannot be easily modified by adjusting R T and C T, unlike the UC3842A family. The maximum duty cycle\nlimit is set by the ratio of the external oscillator charging resistor R T and the internal oscillator discharge\ntransistor on-resistance, like the UC3842. However, maximum duty cycle limits less than 90% (for the UCC2802\nand UCC2803) and less than 45% (for the UCC2804 and UCC2805) can not reliably be set in this manner. For\nbetter control of maximum duty cycle, consider using the UCCx807.\n9.3.1.5 GND\nGND pin is the signal and power returning ground. TI recommends separating the signal return path and the\nhigh current gate driver path so that the signal is not affected by the switching current.\n9.3.1.6 OUT\nOUT is the output of a high-current power driver capable of driving the gate of a power MOSFET with peak\ncurrents exceeding 750 mA. OUT is actively held low when VCC is below the UVLO threshold. The high-current\npower driver consists of FET output devices, which can switch all of the way to GND and all of the way to VCC.\nThe output stage also provides a low impedance to overshoot and undershoot. This means that in many cases,\nexternal Schottky clamp diodes are not required.\nThe output of the UCC280x is a CMOS output versus a Bipolar output on the UC3842 family. Peak output\ncurrent remains the same ±1 A. The CMOS output provides very smooth rising and falling waveforms, with\nvirtually no overshoot or undershoot. Additionally, the CMOS output provides a low resistance to the supply in\nresponse to overshoot, and a low resistance to ground in response to undershoot. Because of this, Schottky\ndiodes may not be necessary on the output. Furthermore, the UCC2802 has a self-biasing, active low output\nduring UVLO. This feature eliminates the gate to source bleeder  resistor associated with the MOSFET gate\ndrive. Finally, no MOSFET gate voltage clamp is necessary with the UCC280x as the on-chip Zener diode\nautomatically clamps the output to VCC.\n9.3.1.7 VCC\nVCC is the power input connection for this device. In normal operation, VCC is powered through a current\nlimiting resistor. Although quiescent VCC current is very low, total supply current is higher, depending on the\nOUT current. Total VCC current is the sum of quiescent VCC current and the average OUT current. Knowing the\noperating frequency and the MOSFET gate charge (Qg), average OUT current can be calculated from Equation\n6.\nOUT gI Q /c61 /c180 f\n(6)\nThe UCC280x has a lower VCC (supply voltage) clamp of 13.5 V typical versus 30 V on the UC3842. For\napplications that require a higher VCC voltage, a resistor must be placed in series with VCC to increase the\nsource impedance. The maximum value of this resistor is calculated with Equation 7 .\nRmax=VIN:min;-VVCC:max;\nIVCC+Qg ×f \n(7)www.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nIn Equation 7 , VIN(min) is the minimum voltage that is used to supply VCC, V VCC(max) is the maximum VCC\nclamp voltage and I VCC is the IC supply current without considering the gate driver current and Q g is the external\npower MOSFET gate charge and f is the switching frequency.\nAdditionally, the UCC280x has an on-chip Zener diode to regulate VCC to 13.5 V. The turnon and turnoff\nthresholds for the UCC280x family are significantly different: 12.5 V and 8 V for the UCC2802 and UCC2804;\n4.1 V and 3.6 V for the UCC2803 and UCC2805. 5-V PWM operation is now possible. To ensure against noise\nrelated problems, filter VCC with an electrolytic and bypass with a ceramic capacitor to ground. Keep the\ncapacitors close to the IC pins.\n9.3.1.8 Pin 8 (REF)\nREF is the voltage reference for the error amplifier and also for many other functions on the IC. REF is also used\nas the logic power supply for high-speed switching logic on the IC. When VCC is greater than 1 V and less than\nthe UVLO threshold, REF is pulled to ground through a 5-kΩ resistor. This means that REF can be used as a\nlogic output indicating power system status. It is important for reference stability that REF is bypassed to GND\nwith a ceramic capacitor as close to the pin as possible. An electrolytic capacitor may also be used in addition to\nthe ceramic capacitor. A minimum of 0.1-μF ceramic capacitor is required. Additional REF bypassing is required\nfor external loads greater than 2.5 mA on the reference. To prevent noise problems with high-speed switching\ntransients, bypass REF to ground with a ceramic capacitor close to the IC package.\nThe UCC2802 and UCC2804 have a 5-V reference. The UCC2803 and UCC2805 have a 4-V reference; both\n±1.5% versus ±2% on the UC3842 family. The output short-circuit current is lower 5 mA versus 30 mA. REF\nmust be bypassed to ground with a ceramic capacitor to prevent oscillation and noise problems. REF can be\nused as a logic output; as when VCC is lower than the UVLO threshold, REF is held low.\n9.3.2 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe UCC280x devices feature undervoltage lockout protection circuits for controlled operation during power-up\nand power-down sequences. Both the supply voltage (VCC) and the reference voltage (Vref) are monitored by\nthe UVLO circuitry. An active low, self-biasing totem pole output during UVLO design is also incorporated for\nenhanced power switch protection.\nUndervoltage lockout thresholds for the UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, and UCC2805 devices are different\nfrom the previous generation of UCx842, UCx843, UCx844, and UCx845 PWMs. Basically, the thresholds are\noptimized for two groups of applications: off-line power supplies and DC-DC converters.\nThe UCC2802 and UCC2804 feature typical UVLO thresholds of 12.5 V for turnon and 8.3 V for turnoff,\nproviding 4.3 V of hysteresis.\nFor low voltage inputs, which include battery and 5-V applications, the UCC2803 and UCC2805 turn on at 4.1 V\nand turn off at 3.6 V with 0.5 V of hysteresis.\nThe UCC2800 and UCC2801 have UVLO thresholds optimized for automotive and battery applications.\nDuring UVLO the IC draws approximately 100 μA of supply current. Once crossing the turnon threshold the IC\nsupply current increases typically to about 500 μA, over an order of magnitude lower than bipolar counterparts.UCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 9-1.

As the PWM output voltage rises while in UVLO, the P device drives the larger N type switch ON, which\nclamps the output voltage low.

However, the reference voltage of the UCC2803 and\nUCC2805 device is 4 V. This change was necessary to facilitate operation with input supply voltages below 5 V.\nMany of the reference voltage specifications are similar to the UC3842 devices although the test conditions have\nbeen changed, indicative of lower-current PWM applications. Similar to their bipolar counterparts, the BiCMOS\ndevices internally pull the reference voltage low during UVLO, which can be used as a UVLO status indication.\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedR\nRTO\nE/A+REF\n0.1 µF\nBYPASSUCC380X\nFigure 9-4.

The rise time is set by the time constant of R T\nand C T. The fall time is set by C T and an internal transistor on-resistance of approximately 130 Ω. During the fall\ntime, the output is OFF and the maximum duty cycle is reduced below 50% or 100%, depending on the part\nnumber. Larger timing capacitors increase the discharge time and reduce the maximum duty cycle and\nfrequency.\n8\n4+\n+R Q\nSREF\nRCRT\nCT0.2V\n2.65V\nFigure 9-6. Oscillator Equivalent Circuit\nThe oscillator section of the UCC2800 through UCC2805 BiCMOS devices has few similarities to the UC3842\ntype — other than single pin programming. It does still use a resistor to the reference voltage and capacitor to\nground to program the oscillator frequency up to 1 MHz. Timing component values must be changed because a\nmuch lower charging current is desirable for low-power operation. Several characteristics of the oscillator have\nbeen optimized for high-speed, noise-immune operation. The oscillator peak-to-peak amplitude has been\nincreased to 2.45 V typical versus 1.7 V on the UC3842 family. The lower oscillator threshold has been dropped\nto approximately 0.2 V while the upper threshold remains fairly close to the original 2.8 V at approximately\n2.65 V.\nDischarge current of the timing capacitor has been increased to nearly 20-mA peak as opposed to roughly 8 mA.\nThis can be represented by approximately 130 Ω in series with the discharge switch to ground. A higher current\nwas necessary to achieve brief dead times and high duty cycles with high-frequency operation. Practical\napplications can use these new ICs to a 1-MHz switching frequency.www.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\n2.65 V\nVCT\n0.2 V\n0 V\nfCONVFigure 9-7.

The\nICs oscillator is programmed to free run at a frequency about 20% lower than that of the synchronizing\nfrequency. A brief positive pulse is applied across the 50-Ω resistor to force synchronization. Typically, a 1-V\namplitude pulse of 100-ns width is sufficient for most applications.\nThe ICs can also be synchronized to a pulse train input directly to the oscillator RC pin. Note that the IC\ninternally pulls low at this node once the upper oscillator threshold is crossed. This 130-Ω impedance to ground\nremains active until the pin is lowered to approximately 0.2 V. External synchronization circuits must\naccommodate these conditions.UCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nREF\nRC\nSYNC\n§\x0350 \r\x03RT\nCTFigure 9-9. Synchronizing the Oscillator\n9.3.7 PWM Generator\nMaximum duty cycle is higher for these devices than for their UC384x predecessor. This is primarily due to the\nhigher ratio of timing capacitor discharge to charge current, which can exceed one hundred to one in a typical\nBiCMOS application. Attempts to program the oscillator maximum duty cycle much below the specified range by\nadjusting the timing component values of R T and C T must be avoided. There are two reasons to stay away from\nthis design practice. First, the ICs high discharge current would necessitate higher charging currents than\nnecessary for programming, defeating the purpose of low power operation. Secondly, a low-value timing resistor\nprevents the capacitor from discharging to the lower threshold and initiating the next switching cycle.\n9.3.8 Minimum Off-Time Setting (Dead-Time Control)\nDead time is the term used to describe the ensured OFF time of the PWM output during each oscillator cycle. It\nis used to ensure that even at maximum duty cycle, there is enough time to reset the magnetic circuit elements,\nand prevent saturation. The dead time of the UCC280x PWM family is determined by the internal 130-Ω\ndischarge impedance and the timing capacitor value. Larger capacitance values extend the dead time whereas\nsmaller values results in higher maximum duty cycles for the same operating frequency. A curve for dead time\nversus timing capacitor values is provided in Figure 9-10 . Increasing the dead time is possible by adding a\nresistor between the RC pin of the IC and the timing components, as shown in Figure 9-11 . The dead time\nincreases with the discharge resistor value to about 470 Ω as indicated from the curve in Figure 9-12 . Higher\nresistances must be avoided as they can decrease the dead time and reduce the oscillator peak-to-peak\namplitude. Sinking too much current (1 mA) by reducing R T will freeze  the oscillator OFF by preventing\ndischarge to the lower comparator threshold voltage of 0.2 V. Adding this discharge control resistor has several\nimpacts on the oscillator programming. First, it introduces a DC offset to the capacitor during the discharge – but\nnot the charging portion of the timing cycle, thus lowering the usable peak-to-peak timing capacitor amplitude.\nBecause of the reduced peak-to-peak amplitude, the exact value of C T may require adjustment from UC3842\ntype designs to obtain the correct initial oscillator frequency. One alternative is keep the same value timing\ncapacitor and adjust both the timing and discharge resistor values because these are readily available in finer\nnumerical increments.www.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nC (pF)T40T (ns)d\n6080100120140160180200\n0 125 250 375 500Figure 9-10.

This 100-ns period must\nbe adequate for most switch-mode designs but can be lengthened by adding an external R/C filter.

Current Sense Waveforms With\nLeading Edge Blanking\n9.3.10 Minimum Pulse Width\nThe leading edge blanking circuitry can lead to a minimum pulse width equal to the blanking interval under\ncertain conditions. This occurs when the error amplifier output voltage (minus a diode drop and divided by 1.65)\nis lower than the current sense input. However, the amplifier output voltage must also be higher than a diode\nforward voltage drop of about 0.5 V. It is only during these conditions that a minimum output pulse width equal to\nthe blanking duration can be obtained. Note that the PWM comparator has two inputs; one is from the current\nsense input. The other PWM input is the error amplifier output that has a diode and two resistors in series to\nground. The diode in this network is used to ensure that zero duty cycle can be reached. Whenever the E/A\noutput falls below a diode forward voltage drop, no current flows in the resistor divider and the PWM input goes\nto zero, along with pulse width.\n+\n–\nFigure 9-15.

Note that the 100-\nns leading edge blanking pulse is applied to this current limiting circuitry. The blanking overrides the current limit\ncomparator output to prevent the leading edge switch noise from triggering a current limit function. Propagation\ndelay from the current limit comparator to the output is typically 70 ns. This high-speed path minimizes power\nsemiconductor dissipation during an overload by abbreviating the ON time.\nFor increased efficiency in the current sense circuitry, the circuit shown in Figure 9-16  can be used.

This overcurrent comparator has a 1.5-V threshold and is also gated\nby the leading edge blanking signal to prevent false triggering. Once triggered, the overcurrent comparator uses\nthe internal soft-start capacitor to generate a delay before retry is attempted. Often referred to as hiccup , this\ndelay time is used to significantly reduce the input and dissipated power of the main converter and switching\ncomponents. Full Cycle Soft Start ensures that there is a predictable delay of greater than 3 ms between\nsuccessive attempts to operate during fault. The circuit shown in Figure 9-18  and the timing diagram in Figure\n9-19 show how the IC responds to a severe fault, such as a saturated inductor. When the fault is first detected,\nthe internal soft-start capacitor instantly discharges and stays discharged until the fault clears. At the same time,\nthe PWM output is turned off and held off. When the fault clears, the capacitor slowly charges and allows the\nerror amp output (COMP) to rise. When COMP gets high enough to enable the output, another fault occurs,\nlatching off the PWM output, but the soft-start capacitor still continues to rise to 4 V before being discharged and\npermitting start of a new cycle. This means that for a severe fault, successive retries is spaced by the time\nrequired to fully charge the soft-start capacitor. TI recommends low leakage transformer designs in high-\nfrequency applications to activate the overcurrent protection feature. Otherwise, the switch current may not ramp\nup sufficiently to trigger the overcurrent comparator within the leading edge blanking duration. This condition\nwould cause continual cyclical triggering of the cycle-by-cycle current limit comparator but not the overcurrent\ncomparator. This would result in brief high power dissipation durations in the main converter at the switching\nfrequency. The intent of the overcurrent comparator is to reduce the effective retry rate under these conditions to\na few milliseconds, thus significantly lowering the short-circuit power dissipation of the converter.UCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFull Cycle\nSoft Start0.5 VRR\nSS\nQQ\n4 VRef\nOKVCC\nOKOver-Current\n1.5 VLeading Edge\nBlankingCS\n3FB COMP\n2 1\nREF/2\n/c116= 5 msFigure 9-18.

Slope compensation is necessary with applications with duty cycles exceeding 50%, but also improves\nperformance in those below 50%.

Adding Slope Compensation\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe UCC280x family of high-speed, low-power integrated circuits has the following function modes.\n9.4.1 Normal Operation\nDuring this operation mode, IC controls the power converter into the voltage mode or current mode control,\nregulate the output voltage or current through the converter duty cycle. The regulation can be achieve through\nthe integrated error amplifier or external feedback circuitry.\n9.4.2 UVLO Mode\nDuring the system start-up, VCC voltage starts to rise from 0. Before the VCC voltage reaches its corresponding\nturn on threshold, the IC is operate under UVLO mode. In this mode, REF pin voltage is not generated. When\nVCC is above 1 V and below the turn on threshold, the RFE pin is actively pulled low through a 5-kΩ resistor.\nThis way, REF pin can be used as a logic signal to indicate UVLO mode.\n9.4.3 Soft Start Mode\nOnce VCC voltage rises across the UVLO level, or comes out of a fault mode, it enters the soft start mode.\nDuring soft start, the internal soft start capacitor C SS clamps the error amplifier output voltage, forces it rise\nslowly. This in turn controls the power converter peak current rising slowly, reducing the voltage and current\nstress to the system. The UCC280x family has a fixed build in soft-start time at 4 ms.\n9.4.4 Fault Mode\nA separate overcurrent comparator within the UCC280x devices handles operation into a short-circuited or\nseverely overloaded power supply output. This overcurrent comparator has a 1.5-V threshold and is also gated\nby the leading edge blanking signal to prevent false triggering. When the fault is first detected, the internal soft-\nstart capacitor instantly discharges and stays discharged until the fault clears. At the same time, the PWM output\nis turned off and held off. This is often referred to as hiccup . This delay time is used to significantly reduce the\ninput and dissipated power of the main converter and switching components. Full cycle soft start insures that\nthere is a predictable delay of greater than 3 milliseconds between successive attempts to operate during fault.\nWhen the fault clears, the capacitor slowly charges and allows the error amp output (COMP) to rise. When\nCOMP gets high enough to enable the output, another fault occurs, latching off the PWM output, but the soft-\nstart capacitor still continues to rise to 4 V before being discharged and permitting start of a new cycle. This\nmeans that for a severe fault, successive retries are spaced by the time required to fully charge the soft-start\ncapacitor.www.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\n10 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI\ndoes not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

Based on the desired minimum bulk\nvoltage level, the bulk capacitor value can be calculated as Equation 8 .\n\x0b \x0cª º § · « » ¨ ¸ u« » ¨ ¸ © ¹ ¬ ¼\n\x10\x0e u \nS u \nu2BULK(min)\nIN\nIN(min)\nBULK2IN(min) BULK(min) LINEV 12P 0.25 arcsin\n2 V C\n2V V f\n(8)\nIn Equation 8 , PIN is the maximum output power divided by target efficiency, V IN(min)   is the minimum AC input\nvoltage RMS value. V BULK(min)  is the target minimum bulk voltage, and f LINE is the line frequency.\nBased on the equation, to achieve 75-V minimum bulk voltage, assuming 85% converter efficiency and 47-Hz\nminimum line frequency, the bulk capacitor must be larger than 127 µF and 180 µF was chosen in the design,\nconsidering the tolerance of the capacitors.\nThe transformer design starts with selecting a suitable switching frequency. Generally the switching frequency\nselection is based on the tradeoff between the converter size and efficiency, based on the simple Flyback\ntopology. Normally, higher switching frequency results in smaller transformer size. However, the switching loss is\ngoing to be increased and hurts the efficiency. Sometimes, the switching frequency is selected to avoid certain\ncommunication band to prevent the noise interference with the communication. The frequency selection is\nbeyond the scope of this data sheet.\nThe switching frequency is selected as 110 kHz, to minimize the transformer size. At the same time, the\nregulations start to have limit on EMI noise at 150 kHz, design 110-kHz switching frequency can help to minimize\nthe EMI filter size.\nThen the transformer turns ratio can be selected based on the desired MOSFET voltage rating and diode\nvoltage rating. Because maximum input voltage is 265 V AC, the peak voltage can be calculated as Equation 9 .\nBULK(max) IN(max)V 2 V 375 V /c61 /c180 /c187\n(9)\nTo minimize the cost of the system, the popular 650-V MOSFET is selected. Considering the design margin and\nextra voltage ringing on the MOSFET drain, the reflected output voltage must be less than 120 V. The\ntransformer turns ratio can be selected as Equation 10 .www.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 27\nps120Vn 1012V/c61 /c61(10)\nThe diode voltage stress is the output voltage plus the reflected input voltage.

Larger inductor would allow the converter\nstays in CCM longer. However, it tends to increase the transformer size. Normally, the transformer magnetizing\ninductor is selected so that the converter enters CCM operation at about 50% load at minimum line voltage. This\nwould be a tradeoff between the transformer size and the efficiency. In this particular design, due to the higher\noutput current, it is desired to keep the converter deeper in the CCM and minimize the conduction loss and\noutput ripple. The converter enters CCM operation at about 10% load at minimum bulk voltage.\nThe inductor can be calculated as Equation 12 .\n2\n2 PS OUT\nBULK(min)\nBULK(min) PS OUT\nm\nIN SWn VVV n V 1L2 10 % P/c230 /c246\n/c180/c231 /c247/c231 /c247 /c43/c232 /c248/c61/c180 /c180 f\n(12)\nIn this equation, the switching frequency is 110 kHz. Therefore, the transformer inductance must be about\n1.7 mH. 1.5 mH is chosen as the magnetizing inductor value.\nThe auxiliary winding provides the power for UCC2800 normal operation. The auxiliary winding voltage is the\noutput voltage reflected to the primary side. It is desired to have higher reflected voltage so that the IC can\nquickly get energy from the transformer and make the heavy load startup easier. However, the high the reflect\nvoltage makes the IC consumes more power. Therefore, tradeoff is required.\nIn this design, the auxiliary winding voltage is selected the same as the output voltage so that it is above the\nUVLO level and keep the IC and driving loss low. Therefore, the auxiliary winding to the output winding turns\nratio is selected as Equation 13 .\nas12 Vn 112 V/c61 /c61\n(13)\nBased on calculated inductor value and the switching frequency, the current stress of the MOSFET and diode\ncan be calculated.\nThe peak current of the MOSFET can be calculated as Equation 14 .\nIPKMOS=PIN\nVBULK:min;×nPSVOUT\nVBULK:min;+nPSVOUT+1\n2VBULK(min)\nLm×nPSVOUT\nVBULK:min;+nPSVOUT\nfsw \n(14)\nThe MOSFET peak current is 1.425 A.\nThe diode peak current is the reflected MOSFET peak current on the secondary side.\nDIODE MOSPK ps PKI n I 14.25 A /c61 /c180 /c61\n(15)\nThe RMS current of the MOSFET can be calculated as Equation 16 .UCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nMOS\nMOS MOS2 2\nPK BULK(min) BULK(min) 3 2\nRMS PK\nm sw m swD I V V 1I D D I3 L L/c230 /c246/c61 /c180 /c45 /c43 /c180 /c231 /c247/c231 /c247 /c180 /c180/c232 /c248f f(16)\nIn Equation 16 , D is the MOSFET duty cycle at minimum bulk voltage and it can be calculated as Equation 17 .\nps OUT\nBULK(min) ps OUTn VDV n V/c61/c43\n(17)\nThe MOSFET RMS current is 0.75 A.

Typically, the direct current sense\nsignal contains a large amplitude leading edge spike associated with the turnon of the main power MOSFET,\nreverse recovery of the output rectifier, and other factors including charging and discharging of parasitic\ncapacitances. Therefore, C CSF and R CSF form a low-pass filter that provides additional immunity beyond the\ninternal blanking time to suppress the leading edge spike. For this converter, C CSF is chosen to be 270 pF to\nprovide enough filtering.\nWithout R P, RCS sets the maximum peak current in the transformer primary based on the maximum amplitude of\nCS pin, 1 V. To achieve 1.425-A primary side peak current, a 0.75-Ω resistor is chosen for R CS.\nThe high current sense threshold help to provide better noise immunity but the current sense loss is increased.\nThe current sense loss can be minimized by injecting offset voltage into the current sense signal. R P and R CS\nform a resistor divider network from the current sense signal to the device’s reference voltage to offset the\ncurrent sense voltage. This technique still achieves current mode control with cycle-by-cycle overcurrent\nprotection. To calculate required offset value (Voffset), use Equation 19 .\n\x0e CSF\noffset REF\nCSF PRV V R R \n(19)\n10.2.2.2 Gate Drive Resistor\nRG is the gate driver resistor for the power switch, Q A. The selection of this resistor value must be done in\nconjunction with EMI compliance testing and efficiency testing. Larger R G slows down the turnon and turnoff of\nthe MOSFET. Slower switching speed reduces EMI but also increases the switching loss. A tradeoff between\nswitching loss and EMI performance must be carefully performed. For this design, 10 Ω was chosen as the gate\ndriver resistor.\n10.2.2.3 Vref Capacitor\nA precision 5-V reference voltage is designed to perform several important functions. The reference voltage is\ndivided down internally to 2.5 V and connected to the error amplifier’s noninverting input for accurate outputwww.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nvoltage regulation. Other duties of the reference voltage are to set internal bias currents and thresholds for\nfunctions such as the oscillator upper and lower thresholds along with the overcurrent limiting threshold.\nTherefore, the reference voltage must be bypassed with a ceramic capacitor (C VREF), and 1-μF, 16-V ceramic\ncapacitor was selected for this converter. Placement of this capacitor on the physical printed-circuit board layout\nmust be as close as possible to the respective REF and GND pins as possible\n10.2.2.4 R TCT\nThe internal oscillator uses a timing capacitor (C T) and a timing resistor (R T) to program operating frequency and\nmaximum duty cycle. The operating frequency can be programmed based the curves in Figure 8-3 , where the\ntiming resistor can be found once the timing capacitor is selected. The selection of timing capacitor also affects\nthe maximum duty cycle provided in Figure 8-5 . It is best for the timing capacitor to have a flat temperature\ncoefficient, typical of most COG or NPO type capacitors. For this converter, 13.6 kΩ and 1000 pF were selected\nfor R T and C T to operate at 110-kHz switching.\n10.2.2.5 Start-Up Circuit\nAt startup, the IC gets its power directly from the high voltage bulk, through a high voltage resistor R H. The\nselection of start-up resistor is the tradeoff between power loss and start-up time. The current flowing through R H\nat minimum input voltage must be higher than the VCC current under UVLO condition (0.2 mA at its maximum\nvalue). A 150-kΩ resistor is chosen as the result of the tradeoff.\nAfter VCC is charged up above UVLO on threshold, UCC2800 starts to operate and consumes full operating\ncurrent. At the beginning, because the output voltage is low, VCC cannot get energy from the auxiliary winding.\nVCC capacitor requires to hold enough energy to prevent its voltage drop below UVLO during start-up time,\nbefore output reaches high enough. A larger capacitor holds more energy but slows down the start-up time. In\nthis design, a 120-µF capacitor is chosen to provide enough energy for the start-up purpose.\n10.2.2.6 Voltage Feedback Compensation\nFeedback compensation, also called closed-loop control, reduces or eliminates steady state error, reduces the\nsensitivity to parametric changes, changes the gain or phase of a system over some desired frequency range,\nreduces the effects of small signal load disturbances and noise on system performance, and creates a stable\nsystem. The following section describes how to compensate an isolated Flyback converter with the peak current\nmode control.\n10.2.2.6.1 Power Stage Gain, Zeroes, and Poles\nThe first step in compensating a fixed frequency flyback is to verify if the converter is continuous conduction\nmode (CCM) or discontinuous conduction mode (DCM).  If the primary inductance, L P, is greater than the\ninductance for DCM, CCM boundary mode operation, called the critical inductance, or L Pcrit, then the converter\noperates in CCM calculated with Equation 20 .\n22\nOUT PS IN\nPcrit\nSW IN OUT PSR N VL2 f V V N/c230 /c246 /c180/c61 /c180 /c231 /c247/c180 /c43 /c180/c232 /c248\n(20)\nFor the entire input voltage range, the selected inductor has value larger than the critical inductor. Therefore, the\nconverter operates in CCM and the compensation loop requires design based on CCM flyback equations.\nThe current-to-voltage conversion is done externally with the ground-referenced current sense resistor, R CS, and\nthe internal resistor divider sets up the internal current sense gain, A CS = 1.65.  The IC technology allows the\ntight control of the resistor divider ratio, regardless of the actual resistor value variations.\nThe DC open-loop gain, G O, of the fixed-frequency voltage control loop of a peak current mode control CCM\nflyback converter shown in Figure 10-1  is approximated by first using the output load, R OUT, the primary to\nsecondary turns ratio, N PS, the maximum duty cycle, D, calculated in Equation 21 .UCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41OUT PS\nO 2CS CS/CharA0\nLR N 1GR A /CharA0 1 D2 M 1/c180/c61 /c180/c180 /c45/c43 /c180 /c43/c116(21)\nIn Equation 21 , D is calculated with Equation 22 , τL is calculated with Equation 23 , and M is calculated with\nEquation 24 .\nPS OUT\nIN PS OUTN VDV (N ) V/c180/c61/c43 /c180\n(22)\nP SW\nL/CharA0 2\nOUT PS2 L f\nR N/c180 /c180/c116 /c61\n/c180\n(23)\nOUT PS\nINV NMV/c180/c61\n(24)\nFor this design, a converter with an output voltage V OUT of 12 V, and 48 W relates to an output load, R OUT, equal\nto 3 Ω at full load.\nAt minimum input voltage of 75 V DC, the duty cycle reaches it maximum value of 0.615.

RHP zero has the\nsame 20 dB/decade rising gain magnitude with increasing frequency just like a left-half plane zero, but it adds\nphase lag instead of lead.

The R RAMP  and R CSF forms a voltage divider from the RC pin ramp voltage and inject the slope\ncompensation into CS pin. Choose R RAMP  much larger than the R T resistor  so that it won’t affect much the\nfrequency setting.  In this design, R RAMP  is selected as 24.9 kΩ.

A series resistor from VCC to the input supply source is required with inputs\nabove 12 V to limit the shunt regulator current. A maximum of 10 mA can be shunted to ground by the internal\nregulator. The internal regulator in conjunction with the device’s low start-up and operating current can greatly\nsimplify powering the device and may eliminate the requirement for a regulated bootstrap auxiliary supply and\nwinding in many applications. The supply voltage is MOSFET gate level compatible and requires no external\nZener diode or regulator protection with a current-limited input supply. The UVLO start-up threshold is 1 V below\nthe shunt regulator level on the UCC2802 and UCC2804 devices to ensure start-up. It is important to bypass the\nICs supply (VCC) and reference voltage (REF) pins with a 0.1-µF to 1-µF ceramic capacitor to ground. The\ncapacitors must be placed as close to the actual pin connections as possible for optimal noise filtering. A\nsecond, larger filter capacitor may also be required in offline applications to hold the supply voltage (VCC) above\nthe UVLO turnoff threshold during start-up.\nThe UVLO start threshold of the UCC280-[2,4] devices has a range of 11.5 V to 13.5 V, while the protection\nzener voltage can vary from 12 V to 15 V. However, the absolute maximum supply voltage of the IC is specified\nat 12 V. This absolute maximum is defined as the lowest possible Zener voltage when driven from a low\nimpedance (voltage) source. The zener voltage is always higher than the UVLO start voltage. These two\nparameters track each other and the chip is tested to guarantee that the Zener voltage will never be below that\nof the start voltage. To limit the current flowing in the internal clamp zener, a series resistor must be added.\nFailure to provide a series resistance between the auxiliary voltage source and the Vcc pin of the controller, to\nlimit the current and voltage stress within rated levels on the Vcc pin may result in permanent damage to the\ncontroller. In automotive or industrial applications where there is a risk of high power load transients which may\ncause transients or voltage excursions on the Vcc rail supplying the PWM controller it is recommended to add an\nexternal Zener diode across the Vcc pin. The external Zener acts as an additional protection to the impedance\nprovided by the series resistor between the Vcc source and Vcc pin.\nPlacing a resistor, Rg, in series with the gate of the mosfet allows the mosfet switching speed to be adjusted and\nalso can be used to keep the peak gate drive currents within the specified limits of the controller.\nUCC280x\n1uFExternal 13V Zener\n (Recommended \nwhen there is a risk of \ntransients on \nbias supply) VCC\n0.1uFREF\nOUT Rg\nRcsRvccRstart\nCauxHV DC BUS\nBootstrap\nTo\nOutput\nFigure 11-1.

If possible,\nuse separate ground traces for the timing capacitor and all other functions.\n• The CS pin filter capacitor must be as close to the IC possible and grounded right at the IC ground pin. This\nensures the best filtering effect and minimizes the chance of current sense pin malfunction.\n• Gate driver loop area must be minimized to reduce the EMI noise because of the high di/dt current in the loop.www.ti.comUCC2800, UCC2801, UCC2802, UCC2803, UCC2804, UCC2805\nSLUS270G – MARCH 1999 – REVISED MAY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 37\n12.2 Layout Example\nTO-220FP Bottom View\nREFOUTGND\nCOMPCS\nFBRC\nVCCUCC2800\nRCSO\nREGRTCT\nCREFCCSF\nCVCC3RRAMPCRAMP\nRGRCSFRCS1\nRCS2\nTrack To\n     Transformer  =>\nFBG\nCFBRFB2\nRFB1     Track To\n<=  \x11µol\x03\x12\x02\x89\x035MOSFET Heatsink\nAux CapS\nDG\nCSNUBRSNUB1\nRSNUB2Wave Solder Direction ==>CVCC1CVCC2     Track To\n<=  Bulk Cap + TRANSFORMER6\n4\n12AUX Winding ½ PRI Winding ½ PRI Winding\n22AWG \nJumper \nWire\n22AWG Jumper Wires\nPCB Bottom-side ViewK\nA CE\nOPTO-ISOLATOR\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 12-1.

\n(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:\nACTIVE: Product device recommended for new designs.\nLIFEBUY:  TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.\nNRND: Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.\nPREVIEW:  Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.\nAddendum-Page 4\nPACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM\nwww.ti.com 6-Apr-2023\nOBSOLETE:  TI has discontinued the production of the device.\n \n(2) RoHS:  TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances,  including the requirement that RoHS substance\ndo not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may\nreference these types of products as "Pb-Free".\nRoHS Exempt:  TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.\nGreen: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (Cl) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold.  Antimony trioxide based\nflame retardants must also meet the <=1000ppm threshold requirement.\n \n(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.\n \n(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.\n \n(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation\nof the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.\n \n(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two\nlines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.\n \nImportant Information and Disclaimer: The information provided on this page represents TI\'s knowledge and belief as of the date that it is provided.
