The AD8515 is a rail-to-rail input and output amplifier with  \na gain bandwidth of 5 MHz and typical offset voltage of 1 mV from a 1.8 V supply. The low supply current makes these parts \nideal for battery-powered applications. The 2.7 V/μs slew rate \nmakes the AD8515 a good match for driving ASIC inputs such \nas voice codecs. \nThe AD8515 is specified over the extended industrial \ntemperature range of −40°C to +125°C. \nAD8515 Data Sheet \nRev.

E | Page 12 of 16 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe AD8515, offered in space -saving SOT -23 and SC70 packages,  \nis a rail -to-rail input and output operational amplifier that can \noperate at supply voltages as low as 1.8 V . This product is fabri -\ncated using 0.6 micron CMOS to achieve on e of the best power \nconsumption -to-speed ratios (that is , bandwidth) in the industry. \nWith a small amount o f supply current (less than 400  μA),  \na wide unity gain bandwidth of 4.5 MHz is available for signal \nprocessing. \nThe input stage consists of two parallel, complementary, differ -\nential pairs of PMOS and NMOS. The AD8515 exhibits  no \nphase reversal becau se the input signal exceeds the supply by \nmore than 0.6 V . Currents into the input pin must be limited  \nto 5 mA or less by the use of external series resistance(s). The \nAD8 515 has a very robust ESD design and can stand ESD \nvoltages of up to 4 000 V .  \nPOWER CONSUMPTION vs. BANDWIDTH  \nOne of the strongest features of the AD8515 is the bandwidth \nstability over the specified temperature range while consuming \nsmall amounts of current. This effect is shown in Figure 2 through \nFigure 4 .  This product solves the speed/power requirements for many \napplications. The wide ba ndwidth is also stable even when operated \nwith low supply voltages. Figure 5 shows the relationship between \nthe supply voltage vs . the bandwidth for the AD8515.  \nThe AD8515 is ideal for battery -powered instrumentation and \nhandheld devices because  it can operate at the end of discharge \nvoltage of most popular batteries. Table 6 lists t he nominal and \nend of discharge voltages of several typical batteries.  \nTable 6.

This is due to the \ndegradation of phase margin caused by additional phase lag from \nthe capacitive load. The value of capacitive load that an amplifier  \ncan drive before oscillation varies wi th gain, supply voltage, input \nsignal, temperature, and other parameters. Unity gain is the most challenging configuration for driving capacitive loads. The AD8515  \nis capable of driving large cap acitive loads without any external \ncompensation. The graphs in Figure 31 and Figure 32 show the \namplifier’s capacitive load driving capability when configured  in unity gai n of +1.  \nThe AD8515 is even capable of driving higher capacitive loads \nin inverting gain of − 1, as shown in Figure 33. \n03024-031VOLTAGE (100mV/DIV)\nTIME (1µs/DIV)VS = ±2.5V\nCL = 50pF\nGAIN = 1\nF\nigure 31.

E | Page 14 of 16 A MICROPOWER R EFERENCE VOLTAGE  GENERATOR\nMany single -supp ly circuits are configured with the circuit \nbiased to one -half of the supply voltage. In these cases, a false \nground reference can be created by using a voltage divider buffered \nby an amplifier. Figure 35 shows the schematic for such a circuit. \nThe two 1 MΩ  resistors generate the reference voltages while \ndrawing only 0.9 μA of current from a 1.8 V supply. A capacitor \nconnected from the inverting terminal to the output of the op amp \nprovides compensation to allow for a bypass capa citor to be \nconnected at the reference output. This bypass capacitor helps \nestablish an ac ground for the reference output.  \n03024-035AD8515C3\n1µF\nC2\n0.022µFC1\n1µF\nR3\n10kΩR21MΩR4\n100Ω1.8V TO 5V\n0.9V TO 2.5VR11MΩ3\n41U1\nV+\nV–+\n–\nF\nigure 35. Micropower Voltage Reference Generator  \nA 100 kHz SINGLE -SUPPLY SECOND -ORDER \nBAND -PASS FILTER  \nThe circuit in Figure 36 is commonly used in portable applica -\ntions where low power consumption and wide bandwidth are \nrequired. This figure shows a circuit for a single -supply band -pass \nfilter with a center frequency of 100 kHz. I t is essential that the \nop amp have  a loop gain at 100 kHz to maintain an accurate center \nfrequency. This loop gain requirement necessitates the choice of \nan op amp with a high unity gain crossover frequency, such as \nthe AD8515. The 4.5  MHz bandwidth of the AD8515  is sufficient \nto accurately produce the 100 kHz center frequency, as the r esponse \nin Figure  37 show s. When the op amp  bandwidth is close to the  \ncenter frequency  of the filter, the amplifier  internal phase shift \ncauses excess phase shift at 100 kHz, altering the filter  response. \nIn fact, if the chosen op amp has a bandwidth close to 100 kHz, the phase sh ift of the op amps cause s the loop to oscillate.  \nA common -mode bias level is easily created by connecting the \nnoninverting input to a resistor divider consisting of two resistors connected between VCC and ground. This bias point is also decoupled to ground  with a 1 μ F capacitor.
