C For more information www.analog.com\n Document FeedbackTYPICAL APPLICATION FEATURES DESCRIPTION36V, 4A, 1.5MHz  Synchronous Step-Down Switching \nRegulator with 70µA  Quiescent Current\nThe LT®3690  is an adjustable frequency monolithic buck \nswitching regulator that accepts input voltages up to 36V. \nA high efficiency 90mΩ  switch is included on the device \nalong with the boost diode and the necessary oscillator , \ncontrol, and logic circuitry. The internal synchronous \npower switch of 30mΩ  increases efficiency and eliminates \nthe need for an external Schottky catch diode. Current \nmode topology is used for fast transient response and \ngood loop stability. Shutdown reduces input supply cur -\nrent to less than 1µA. The low ripple Burst Mode main -\ntains high efficiency at low output currents while keeping \noutput ripple below 15mV  in typical applications.\nThe LT3690  features robust operation and is easily config -\nurable. Using a resistor divider on the UVLO pin provides \na programmable undervoltage lockout. A power good \nflag signals when V OUT reaches 90% of the programmed \noutput voltage. Protection circuitry senses the current \nin the power switches to protect the LT3690  against \nshort-circuit conditions. Frequency foldback and thermal \nshutdown provide additional protection. The LT3690  is \navailable in a 4mm  × 6mm  QFN package with exposed \npads for low thermal resistance.\n3.3V Step-Down ConverterAPPLICATIONS nWide Input Range :\n nOperation from 3.9V to 36V\n nOvervoltage Lockout Protects Circuits  \nThrough 60V T ransients\n n4A Maximum Output Current\n nIntegrated 30mΩ  N-Channel Synchronous Switch \n nLow Ripple ( <15mV P-P) Burst Mode® Operation :  \nIQ = 70µA  at 12V IN to 3.3V OUT\n nProgrammable Input Undervoltage Lockout\n n0.8V Feedback Reference Voltage\n nOutput Voltage : 0.8V to 20V\n nProgrammable and Synchronizable Oscillator  \n(170kHz  to 1.5MHz )\n nSoft-Startup and Output Voltage T racking\n nShort-Circuit Robust\n nPower Good Flag\n nSmall Thermally Enhanced 4mm  × 6mm  QFN Package\n nAutomotive Systems\n nIndustrial Supplies\n nDistributed Supply Regulation\nEfficiency and Power Loss\n3690 TA01aL T3690\nGND680pFVIN EN\nUVLO\nSS\nVC\nVCCINT\nSYNCBST\nSW\nBIAS\nPG\nFB\nRTVIN\n4.5V TO 36V\n0.47µF\nƒ = 600kHz3.3V\n4A\n22k\n32.4k 102k316k3.3µH0.68µF\n100µF10µF\nLOAD CURRENT (A)0EFFICIENCY (%)POWER LOSS (W)100\n6090\n80\n70\n502.5\n0.52.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0\n2 3 1 2.5 3.5 1.5 0.5\n3690 TA01b4VOUT = 5V\nVOUT = 3.3V\nVOUT = 5V\nVOUT = 3.3V\nVIN = 12V\nL = 4.7µH\nƒ = 600kHzAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\n\nLT3690\n2\nRev.

Operating lifetime is \nderated at junction temperatures greater than 125°C.Note 4 : This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction \ntemperature will exceed the maximum operating junction temperature \nwhen overtemperature protection is active. Continuous operation above \nthe specified maximum operating junction temperature may impair device \nreliability.\nNote 5 : This is the minimum voltage across the boost capacitor needed to \nguarantee full saturation of the switch.\nNote 6 : Current limit guaranteed by design and/or correlation to static test. \nSlope compensation reduces current limit at higher duty cycles. Current \nlimit reduced when feedback voltage is below the reference voltage.\nNote 7 : The voltages are referred to GND and currents are assumed \npositive, when the current flows into the pin. Negative magnitudes are \nshown as maximum.\nLT3690\n5\nRev.

C For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS\nSW (Pins 1-4, 23-26, Exposed Pad Pin 27) : The SW pin \nis the emitter output of the internal highside NPN power \nswitch (HS) and the drain output of the internal lowside \npower N-channel switch (LS). Connect this pin to the \ninductor and boost capacitor . This pin is driven up to the \nVIN voltage by the HS switch during the on-time of the \nPWM duty cycle. The inductor current drives the SW pin \nnegative during the off-time. The on-resistance of the LS \nswitch and the internal Schottky diode fixes the negative \nvoltage.\nThe exposed pad is connected internally with SW pins \n1-4, 23-26 and should be soldered to a large copper area \nto reduce thermal resistance. \nSYNC (Pin 5) : The SYNC pin is used to synchronize the \ninternal oscillator to an external signal. It is directly logic \ncompatible and can be driven with any signal between \n20% and 80% duty cycle. The synchronizing range is \nfrom 170kHz  to 1.5MHz . See the Synchronization  section \nin the Applications Information  section for details. When \nnot used for synchronization, the SYNC pin can be tied \nto ground to select low ripple Burst Mode operation or \ntied to the output voltage to select standard PWM mode.\nRT (Pin 7) : Oscillator Resistor Input. Connecting a resis -\ntor to ground (Pin 10) from this pin sets the switching \nfrequency.\nVC (Pin 8) : The V C pin is the output of the internal error \namplifier . The voltage on this pin controls the peak switch \ncurrent. Tie an RC network from this pin to ground to \ncompensate the control loop.\nFB (Pin 9) : The LT3690  regulates the FB pin to 0.8V. \nConnect the feedback resistor divider tap to this pin. The \nadjacent ground pin (Pin 10) is recommended for the \nresistor divider . \nSS (Pin 11) : The SS pin is used to provide a soft-start \nor tracking function. The internal 2µA pull-up current \nISS in combination with an external capacitor tied to this \npin creates a voltage ramp. The output voltage tracks to \nthis voltage. For tracking, tie a resistor divider to this pin \nfrom the tracked output. In undervoltage, overvoltage and thermal shutdown, the SS pin pulls low if the output \nvoltage is below the power good threshold to restart the \noutput voltage with soft-start behavior . If driving this pin \nfrom a digital output, use at least 10k in series. Leave this \npin disconnected if unused.\nUVLO (Pin 12) : Tie a resistor divider between V IN, UVLO, \nand GND to program an undervoltage lockout threshold. \nThe UVLO pin has an accurate 1.25V  threshold. Above the \nthreshold, the part operates normally. Below the thresh -\nold, the part drops into a low quiescent current state. \nSee the Undervoltage Lockout  section in the Applications \nInformation  section for more details.\nVIN (Pins 13, 14, 15) : The V IN pin supplies current to \nthe LT3690 ’s internal regulator and to the internal power \nswitch.

BIAS also supplies the current \nto the LT3690 ’s internal regulator . Tie this pin to the low -\nest availa ble voltage source above 3V (typically V OUT). \nThis pin must be locally bypassed with 10nF .\nVCCINT  (Pin 20) : VCCINT  is an output of the internally gen -\nerated supply voltage for the synchronous power DMOS \ntransistor driver .

C For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nThe LT3690  is a constant frequency, current mode step-\ndown regulator . An oscillator , with frequency set by R T, \nenables an RS flip-flop, turning on the internal high side \n(HS) power switch. An amplifier and comparator monitor \nthe current flowing between the V IN and SW pins, turn -\ning the RS flip-flop and HS switch off when this current \nreaches a level determined by the voltage at V C. \nWhile the high side switch is off, the inductor current con -\nducts through the catch diode and the turned on low side \n(LS) switch until either the next clock pulse of the oscilla -\ntor starts the next cycle, or the inductor current becomes \ntoo low, as indicated by the zero crossing comparator . \nThis prevents the inductor from running reverse current.\nAn error amplifier measures the output voltage through \nan external resistor divider tied to the FB pin and servos \nthe V C pin. If the error amplifier ’s output increases, more \ncurrent is delivered to the output ; if it decreases, less cur -\nrent is delivered. An active clamp on the V C pin provides \ncurrent limit. \nThe SS node acts as an auxiliary input to the error ampli -\nfier . The voltage at FB will servo to the SS voltage until SS \ngoes above 0.8V. Soft-start is implemented by generating \na voltage ramp at the SS pin using an external capacitor \nCSS which is charged by an internal constant current. \nAlternatively, connecting the SS pin to a resistive divider \nbetween the voltage to be tracked and ground provides a \ntracking function. \nAn internal regulator provides power to the control cir -\ncuitry. The bias regulator normally draws power from the \nVIN pin, but if the BIAS pin is connected to an external \nvoltage higher than 3V, bias power will be drawn from the \nexternal source (typically the regulated output voltage). \nThis improves efficiency.\nThe EN pin is used to place the LT3690  in shutdown, \ndisconnecting the output and reducing the input current \nto less than 1µA. A comparator monitors the voltage at \nthe UVLO input. A external resistive divider connected to \nVIN programs the wake up threshold and hysteresis. If \nunused, connect the input to V IN or above 1.5V.The HS switch driver operates from either the input or \nfrom the BOOST pin. An external capacitor is used to \ngenerate a voltage at the BOOST pin that is higher than \nthe input supply. This allows the driver to fully saturate the \ninternal bipolar NPN power switch for efficient operation.\nThe synchronously driven N-channel transistor (LS \nswitch) in parallel with the catch diode reduces the over -\nall solution size and improves efficiency. Internal over -\nload comparator circuitry monitors the current through \nthe LS switch and delays the generation of new switch \npulses if this current is too high (above 5A nominal). This \nmechanism also protects the part during short-circuit and \noverload conditions by keeping the current through the \ninductor under control. A short-circuit protected regula -\ntor at V CCINT  supplies the LS driver . The LS switch only \noperates at V CCINT  voltages greater than 3.8V.\nTo further optimize efficiency, the LT3690  automatically \nswitches to Burst Mode operation in light load situations. \nBetween bursts, all circuitry associated with controlling \nthe output switch is shut down, reducing the input supply \ncurrent to 70µA  in a typical application. Pulling the SYNC \npin above 0.8V prevents Burst Mode operation. The posi -\ntive edge of an external clock signal at the SYNC pin syn -\nchronizes the internal oscillator and therefore switching.\nThe oscillator reduces the LT3690 ’s operating frequency \nwhen the voltage at the FB pin is low. This frequency fold -\nback helps to control the output current during start-up \nand overload conditions. \nThe LT3690  contains a power good comparator which \ntrips when the FB pin is at 90% of its regulated value. The \nPG output is an open-collector transistor that is off when \nthe output is in regulation, allowing an external resistor to \npull the PG pin high. Power good is valid when the LT3690  \nis enabled, the UVLO pin is high and V IN is above 3.9V.\nThe LT3690  has an overvoltage protection feature which \ndisables switching action when V IN goes above 38V (typi -\ncal) during transients. When switching is disabled, the \nLT3690  can safely sustain transient input voltages up \nto\xa060V.\nLT3690\n12\nRev.

Table\xa01   \nshows the necessary R T value for a desired switching \nfrequency.\nTable\xa01.

The advantage of high frequency \noperation is that smaller inductor and capacitor values may \nbe used. The disadvantages are lower efficiency, lower \nmaximum input voltage, and higher dropout voltage. The \nhighest acceptable switching frequency (f SW(MAX) ) for a \ngiven application can be calculated as follows :\n  ƒSW(MAX)=VOUT+VLS\ntON(MIN)•VIN–VSW+VLS ( )\nwhere V IN is the typical input voltage, V OUT is the output \nvoltage, V LS is the LS switch drop ( 0.12V  at maximum \nload) and V SW is the internal switch drop ( 0.37V  at maxi -\nmum load). This equation shows that slower switching \nfrequency is necessary to accommodate high V IN/VOUT \nratio. Also, as shown in the Input Voltage Range  sec-\ntion, lower frequency allows a lower dropout voltage. \nInput voltage range depends on the switching frequency \nbecause the LT3690  switch has finite minimum on and off \ntimes. An internal timer forces the switch to be off for at \nleast t OFF(MIN)  per cycle ; this timer has a maximum value \nof 210ns  over temperature. On the other hand, delays \nassociated with turning off the power switch dictate the \nminimum on-time t ON(MIN)  before the switch can be turned \noff; tON(MIN) has a maximum value of 210ns  (250ns  for  \nTJ > 125°C) over temperature. The minimum and maxi-\nmum duty cycles that can be achieved taking minimum \non and off times into account are :\n DC MIN = ƒSW • tON(MIN)\n DC MAX = 1 – ƒSW • tOFF(MIN)\nwhere ƒ SW is the switching frequency, the t ON(MIN)  is the \nminimum switch on-time ( 210ns ; 250ns  for T J > 125°C), \nand the t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum switch off-time ( 210ns ). \nThese equations show that duty cycle range increases \nwhen switching frequency is decreased.\nA good choice of switching frequency should allow ade -\nquate input voltage range (see Input Voltage Range  sec-\ntion) and keep the inductor and capacitor values small.\nLT3690\n13\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInput Voltage Range\nThe minimum input voltage is determined by either the \nLT3690 ’s minimum operating voltage of 3.9V (VBIAS > \n3V) or by its maximum duty cycle (see equation in the \nOperating Frequency T rade-Offs  section). The minimum \ninput voltage due to duty cycle limitation is :\n  VIN(MIN)=VOUT+VLS\n1–ƒSW•tOFF(MIN)–VLS+VSW\nwhere V IN(MIN)  is the minimum input voltage, and t OFF(MIN)  \nis the minimum switch off-time ( 210ns ). Note that higher \nswitching frequency will increase the minimum input volt -\nage. If a lower dropout voltage is desired, a lower switch -\ning frequency should be used.\nThe maximum input voltage for LT3690  applications \ndepends on switching frequency, the absolute maximum \nratings of the V IN and BST pins, and the operating mode. \nThe LT3690  can operate from continuous input voltages \nup to 36V. If the operating junction temperature is below \n125°C, the LT3690  will tolerate input voltage transients of \nup to 60V. However , note that while V IN > VOVLO (typically \n38V), the LT3690  will stop switching, allowing the output \nto fall out of regulation.\nFor a given application where the switching frequency and \nthe output voltage are already fixed, the maximum input \nvoltage that guarantees optimum output voltage ripple for \nthat application can be found by applying the following \nexpression :\n  VIN(MAX)=VOUT+VLS\nƒSW•tON(MIN)–VLS+VSW\nwhere V IN(MAX)  is the maximum operating input voltage, \nVOUT is the output voltage, V LS is the LS switch drop \n(0.12V  at maximum load), V SW is the internal switch \ndrop ( 0.37V  at maximum load), f SW is the switching fre -\nquency (set by RT), and t ON(MIN)  is the minimum switch \non-time ( 210ns ; 250ns  for T J > 125°C). Note that a higher switching fre quency will reduce the maximum operating \ninput voltage. Conversely, a lower switching frequency \nwill be necessary to achieve optimum operation at high \ninput voltages. The maximum operating voltage is 36V \n(minimum overvoltage lockout threshold).\nSpecial attention must be paid when the output is in start-\nup, short-circuit, or other overload conditions. In these \ncases, the LT3690  tries to bring the output in regula -\ntion by driving current into the output load. During these \nevents, the inductor peak current might easily reach and \neven exceed the maximum current limit of the LT3690 , \nespecially in those cases where the switch already oper -\nates at minimum on-time. The circuitry monitoring the \ncurrent through the LS switch prevents the HS switch \nfrom turning on again if the inductor valley current is \nabove I PSDLIM  (5A nominal). In these cases, the inductor \npeak current is therefore the maximum current limit of \nthe LT3690  plus the additional current overshoot during \nthe turn-off delay due to minimum on-time :\n  IL(PEAK)=8A+VIN(MAX)–VOUTOL\nL•tON(MIN)\nwhere I L(PEAK)  is the peak inductor current, V IN(MAX)  is \nthe maximum expected input voltage, L is the inductor \nvalue, t ON(MIN)  is the minimum on-time and V OUTOL  is \nthe output voltage under the overload condition. The part \nis robust enough to survive prolonged operation under \nthese conditions as long as the peak inductor current does \nnot exceed 9A. Inductor current saturation and excessive \njunction temperature may further limit performance.\nIf the output is in regulation and no short-circuit, start-\nup, or overload events are expected, then input voltage \ntransients of up to V OVLO are acceptable regardless of the \nswitching frequency. In this case, the LT3690  may enter \npulse-skipping operation where some switching pulses \nare skipped to maintain output regulation. In this mode, \nthe output voltage ripple and inductor current ripple will \nbe higher than in normal operation.\nLT3690\n14\nRev.

The inductor ’s \nRMS current rating must be greater than the maximum \nload current and its saturation current should be at least \n30% higher . For highest efficiency, the series resistance \n(DCR) should be less than 0.03Ω . Table\xa02  lists several \nvendors and types that are suitable.\nTable\xa02.

A \nlarger value inductor provides a higher maximum load cur -\nrent, and reduces the output voltage ripple. If your load is \nlower than the maximum load current, then you can relax \nthe value of the inductor and operate with higher ripple \ncurrent. This allows you to use a physically smaller induc -\ntor , or one with a lower DCR, resulting in higher efficiency. \nBe aware that if the inductance differs from the simple rule \nabove, then the maximum load current will depend on input \nvoltage. In addition, low inductance may result in discon -\ntinuous mode operation, which further reduces maximum \nload current. For details of maximum output current and \ndiscontinuous mode operation, see Application Note 44.  Finally, for duty cycles greater than 50% (V OUT/VIN > 0.5), \na minimum inductance is required to avoid sub-harmonic \noscillations :\n  LMIN=VOUT+VLS ( )•0.42MHz\nƒSW\nwhere V LS is the voltage drop of the low side switch ( 0.12V  \nat maximum load), ƒ SW is in MHz, and L MIN is in μH.\nThe current in the inductor is a triangle wave with an \naverage value equal to the load current. The peak switch \ncurrent is equal to the output current plus half the peak-\nto-peak inductor ripple current. The LT3690  limits its \nswitch current in order to protect itself and the system \nfrom overload faults. Therefore, the maximum output cur -\nrent that the LT3690  will deliver depends on the switch \ncurrent limit, the inductor value, and the input and output \nvoltages. \nWhen the switch is off, the potential across the inductor \nis the output voltage plus the low side switch drop. This \ngives the peak-to-peak ripple current in the inductor :\n  ΔIL=1–DC()VOUT+VLS( )\nL•ƒSW()\nwhere ƒ SW is the switching frequency of the LT3690  and L \nis the value of the inductor . The peak inductor and switch \ncurrent is : \n  ISW(PK)=IL(PK)=IOUT+ΔIL\n2\nTo maintain output regulation, this peak current must be \nless than the LT3690 ’s switch current limit I LIM. See the \nTypical Performance graphs for the change in current limit \nvs duty cycle.\nChoosing an inductor value so that the ripple current is \nsmall will allow a maximum output current near the switch \ncurrent limit.\nLT3690\n15\nRev. C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOne approach to choosing the inductor is to start with the \nsimple rule given above, look at the available inductors, \nand choose one to meet cost or space goals. Then use \nthese equations to check that the LT3690  will be able to \ndeliver the required output current. Note again that these \nequations assume that the inductor current is continu -\nous. Discontinuous operation occurs when I OUT is less \nthan ΔI L/2.\nInput Capacitor\nBypass the input of the LT3690  circuit with a ceramic \ncapacitor of X7R or X5R type. Y5V types have poor perfor -\nmance over temperature and applied voltage, and should \nnot be used. A 10µF  ceramic capacitor is adequate to \nbypass the LT3690 , and easily handles the ripple cur -\nrent. Note that larger input capacitance is required when \na lower switching frequency is used. If the input power \nsource has high impedance, or there is significant induc -\ntance due to long wires or cables, additional bulk capaci -\ntance may be necessary. This can be provided with a lower \nperformance electrolytic capacitor .\nStep-down regulators draw current from the input sup -\nply in pulses with very fast rise and fall times. The input \ncapacitor is required to reduce the resulting voltage rip -\nple at the LT3690  and to force this very high frequency \nswitching current into a tight local loop, minimizing EMI. \nA 10µF  capacitor is capable of this task, but only if it is \nplaced close to the LT3690  (see the PCB Layout  section). \nA second precaution regarding the ceramic input capaci -\ntor concerns the maximum input voltage rating of the \nLT3690 . A ceramic input capacitor combined with trace \nor cable inductance forms a high quality (under damped) \ntank circuit. If the LT3690  circuit is plugged into a live \nsupply, the input voltage can ring to twice its nominal \nvalue, possibly exceeding the LT3690 ’s maximum voltage \nrating. See Application Note 88 for more details.\nOutput Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor has two essential functions. Along \nwith the inductor , it filters the square wave generated \nby the LT3690  to produce the DC output. In this role it determines the output ripple, and low impedance at the \nswitching frequency is important. The second function is \nto store energy in order to satisfy transient loads and sta -\nbilize the LT3690 ’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors have \nvery low equivalent series resistance (ESR) and provide \nthe best ripple performance. A good starting value is :\n  COUT=150\nVOUT•ƒSW\nwhere ƒ SW is in MHz, and C OUT is the recommended out -\nput capacitance in µF . Use X5R or X7R types, which will \nprovide low output ripple and good transient response. \nUsing a high value capacitor on the output can improve \ntransient performance, but a phase lead capacitor across \nthe feedback resistor R1 may be required to get the full \nbenefit (see the Frequency Compensation  section).\nHigh performance electrolytic capacitors can be used \nfor the output capacitor . If using an electrolytic capacitor , \nchoose one intended for use in switching regulators, and \nwith a specified ESR of 0.03Ω  or less. Such a capacitor \nwill be larger than a ceramic capacitor and will have a \nlarger capacitance because the capacitor must be large to \nachieve low ESR. Table\xa03  lists several capacitor vendors.\nTable\xa03.

However , ceramic capacitors can sometimes \ncause problems when used with the LT3690  due to their \npiezoelectric nature.

C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nnoise. Since the LT3690  operates at a lower current limit \nduring Bu rst Mode operation, the noise is typically very \nquiet. If this is unacceptable, use a high performance tan -\ntalum or electrolytic capacitor at the output.\nFrequency Compensation\nThe LT3690  uses current mode control to regulate the \noutput. This simplifies loop compensation. In particular , \nthe LT3690  does not require the ESR of the output capaci -\ntor for stability, so you are free to use ceramic capacitors \nto achieve low output ripple and small circuit size. \nFrequency compensation is provided by the components \ntied to the V C pin, as shown in Figure\xa01 . Generally a capaci -\ntor (C C) and a resistor (R C) in series to ground are used. In \naddition, there may be a lower value capacitor in parallel. \nThis capacitor (C F) is not part of the loop compensation \nbut is used to filter noise at the switching frequency, and \nis required only if a phase-lead capacitor is used or if the \noutput capacitor has high ESR.\nLoop compensation determines the stability and transient \nperformance. The best values for the compensation net -\nwork depend on the application and, in particular , the type \nof output capacitor . A practical approach is to start with one of the circuits in this data sheet that is similar to your \napplication and tune the compensation network to opti -\nmize the performance. Stability should then be checked \nacross all operating conditions, including load current, \ninput voltage and temperature. The LT1375  data sheet \ncontains a more thorough discussion of loop compensa -\ntion and describes how to test the stability using a tran -\nsient load. \nFigure\xa0 1  shows an equivalent circuit for the LT3690  \ncontrol loop. The error amplifier is a transconductance \namplifier with finite output impedance. The power section, \nconsisting of the modulator , power switch and inductor , is \nmodeled as a transconductance amplifier generating an \noutput current proportional to the voltage at the V C pin. \nNote that the output capacitor integrates this current, and \nthat the capacitor on the V C pin (C C) integrates the error \namplifier output current, resulting in two poles in the loop. \nIn most cases, a zero is required and comes either from \nthe output capacitor ESR or from a resistor R C in series \nwith C C. This simple model works well as long as the value \nof the inductor is not too high and the loop crossover \nfrequency is much lower than the switching frequency. A \nphase lead capacitor (CPL) across the feedback divider \nmay improve the transient response.  \nFigure\xa01. Model for Loop ResponseFigure\xa02.

Burst Mode OperationLow-Ripple Burst Mode and Pulse-Skipping Mode\nThe LT3690  is capable of operating in either low ripple \nBurst Mode operation or pulse-skipping mode, which is \nselected using the SYNC pin. See the Synchronization and \nMode section for details.\nTo enhance efficiency at light loads, the LT3690  can be \noperated in low ripple Burst Mode operation that keeps \nthe output capacitor charged to the proper voltage while \nminimizing the input quiescent current. During Burst \nMode operation, the LT3690  delivers single cycle bursts \nof current to the output capacitor followed by sleep peri -\nods where the output capacitor is delivers output power \nto the load. Because the LT3690  delivers power to the \noutput with single, low current pulses, the output ripple \nstays below 15mV  for a typical application. In addition, \nVIN and BIAS quiescent currents are reduced to 35µA  \nand 70µA  (typical), respectively, during the sleep time. \nAs the load current decreases towards a no-load condi -\ntion, the percentage of time that the LT3690  operates in \nsleep mode increases and the average input current is \ngreatly reduced, resulting in high efficiency even at very \nlow loads (see Figure\xa03 ). At higher output loads (above \nabout 385mA  at V IN = 12V for the front page application) \nthe LT3690  will run at the frequency programmed by the \nRT resistor , and operate in standard PWM mode. The tran -\nsition between PWM and low ripple Burst Mode operation \nis seamless, and does not disturb the output voltage. If low quiescent current is not required, the LT3690  can \noperate in pulse-skipping mode. The benefit of this mode \nis that the LT3690  will enter full frequency standard PWM \noperation at a lower output load current than when in \nBurst Mode operation. The front page application circuit \nwill switch at full frequency at output loads higher than \nabout 64mA  at V IN = 12V.\nLow Side Switch Considerations\nThe operation of the internal low side switch is optimized \nfor reliable, high efficiency operation. The low side switch \nis connected in parallel with a catch diode. When the top \nside switch turns off, the inductor current pulls the SW \npin low, and forward biases the internal catch diode. In \norder to prevent shoot through currents, the internal low \nside switch only turns on after detecting the SW pin going \nlow. Once the low side switch turns on, the voltage drop \nbetween SW and GND is very small, minimizing power \nloss and improving efficiency. At the end of the switching \ncycle, the low side switch turns off, and after a delay, the \ntop side switch can turn on again. The switching sequence \nis shown in Figure\xa04 .\nThe overload comparator monitors the current flowing \nthrough the low side switch and helps protect the circuit. \nThis comparator delays switching if the low side switch \ncurrent goes higher than 5A (typical) during a fault con -\ndition such as a shorted output with high input voltage.  \nFigure\xa04.

With properly chosen external \ncomponents, this will ensure that the part will survive a \nshort-circuit event.\nVCCINT  Considerations\nThe linear voltage regulator requires a capacitor of 0.47µF  \nto deliver the peak current for the gate driver of the low \nside N-channel transistor . The output voltage is monitored \nby a comparator . To ensure proper operation, the low side \ndriver only turns on if V CCINT  is above 3.8V (typ).\nBST and BIAS Pin Considerations\nCapacitor C BST and the internal boost Schottky diode (see \nthe Block Diagram) are used to generate boost voltages \nthat are higher than the input voltage. In most cases a \n0.68µF  capacitor will work well. Figure\xa05  shows three \nways to arrange the boost circuit. The BST pin must be more than 2.3V above the SW pin for best efficiency. For \noutputs of 3V and above, the standard circuit ( Figure\xa0 5a) \nis best. For outputs between 2.8V and 3V, use a 1µF boost \ncapacitor . A 2.5V output presents a special case because it \nis marginally adequate to support the boosted drive stage \nwhile using the internal boost diode. For reliable BST pin \noperation with 2.5V outputs, use a good external Schottky \ndiode (such as the ON Semi MB R0540 ), and a 1µF boost \ncapacitor (see Figure\xa0 5b). For lower output voltages, the \nboost diode can be tied to the input ( Figure\xa0 5c), or to \nanother supply greater than 2.8V. The circuit in Figure\xa0 5a \nis more efficient because the BST pin current and BIAS \npin quiescent current comes from a lower voltage source. \nHowever , the full benefit of the BIAS pin is not realized \nunless it is at least 3V. Ensure that the maximum voltage \nratings of the BST and BIAS pins are not exceeded.\nThe minimum operating voltage of an LT3690  application \nis limited by the minimum input voltage ( 3.9V) and by \nthe maximum duty cycle as outlined in the Input Voltage \nRange  section. For proper start-up, the minimum input \nFigure\xa05.

If the input \nvoltage is ramped slowly, or the LT3690  is turned on with \nits EN pin when the output is already in regulation, then \nthe boost capacitor may not be fully charged. Because \nthe boost capacitor charges with the energy stored in the \ninductor , the circuit relies on some minimum load current \nto get the boost circuit running properly. This minimum \nload depends on the input and output voltages, and on \nthe arrangement of the boost circuit. The minimum load \ngenerally goes to zero once the circuit has started. Figure\xa06  \nshows a plot of minimum load to start and to run as a \nfunction of input voltage. In many cases the discharged \noutput capacitor will present a load to the switcher , which \nwill allow it to start. The plots show the worst-case situa -\ntion, where V IN is ramping very slowly. For lower start-up \nvoltage, the boost diode can be tied to V IN ; however , this \nrestricts the input range to one-half of the absolute maxi -\nmum rating of the BST pin. At light loads, the inductor cur -\nrent becomes discontinuous and the effective duty cycle \ncan be very high. This reduces the minimum input volt -\nage to approximately 300mV  above V OUT. At higher load \ncurrents, the inductor current is continuous and the duty \ncycle is limited by the maximum duty cycle of the LT3690 , \nrequiring a higher input voltage to maintain regulation.\nSoft-Start\nThe SS (soft-start) pin provides a soft-start function. If \na capacitor C SS is tied from the SS pin to ground, then \nthe internal pull-up current will generate a voltage ramp on this pin. A good value for the soft-start capacitor \nis C OUT/10000, where C OUT is the value of the output \ncapacitor . \nThe soft-start function limits peak input current to the \ncircuit during start-up. The output of the LT3690  regu -\nlates to the lowest voltage present at either the SS pin or \nan internal 0.8V reference. A capacitor from the SS pin \nto ground is charged by an internal 2μA current source \nresulting in a linear output ramp from 0V to the regulated \noutput voltage. The ramp duration is given by :\n  tRAMP=CSS•0.8V\n2µA\nAt power-up, an internal open-collector output discharges \nthe SS pin. The SS pin can be left floating if the soft-\nstart feature is not used. The internal current sources will \ncharge this pin to ~2V as shown in Figure\xa07 .Figure\xa06.

C For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOutput T racking and Sequencing\nOutput tracking and sequencing between voltage regula -\ntors can be implemented using the LT3690 ’s SS and PG \npins. Figure\xa08  and Figure\xa09  show several configurations \nfor output tracking and sequencing of the LT3690  and \nan additional regulator . Independent soft-start for each \nchannel is shown in Figure\xa0 8a. The output ramp time for \neach output is set by the soft-start capacitor as described \nin the Soft-Start  section.\nRatiometric tracking is achieved in Figure\xa0 8b by connect -\ning SS pins of two regulators together . In this configura -\ntion, the SS pin current is set by the sum of the SS pin \ncurrents of the two regulators, which must be taken into \naccount when calculating the output rise time.\nBy connecting a feedback network from OUT1 to the \nSS pin with the same ratio that set the OUT2 voltage, \nabsolute tracking shown in  Figure\xa0 9a is implemented. A \nsmall OUT2 voltage offset will be present due to the SS \npin’s 2µA source current. This offset can be corrected by \nslightly reducing the value of R2.\nFigure\xa0 9b illustrates output sequencing. When V OUT1 is \nwithin 10% of its regulated voltage, PG releases the SS \nsoft-start pin, allowing V OUT2 to soft-start.\nSynchronization\nTo select low-ripple Burst Mode operation, tie the SYNC \npin below 0.4V (this can be ground or a logic output). \nSynchronize the LT3690  oscillator to an external frequency \nby connecting a square wave (with positive and negative \npulse width > 100ns ) to the SYNC pin. The square wave \namplitude should have valleys that are below 0.4V and \npeaks that are above 1V (up to 6V).\nThe LT3690  will not enter Burst Mode operation at low \noutput loads while synchronized to an external clock, but \ninstead will skip pulses to maintain regulation.\nThe LT3690  may be synchronized over a 170kHz  to \n1.5MHz  range. The R T resistor should be chosen to set \nthe LT3690  switching frequency 20% below the lowest \nsynchronization input. For example, if the synchronization \nsignal will be 350kHz  and higher , choose R T for 280kHz . To assure reliable and safe operation, the LT3690  will \nsynchronize when the output voltage is above 90% of its \nregulated voltage. It is therefore necessary to choose a \nlarge enough inductor value to supply the required output \ncurrent at the frequency set by the R T resistor (see the \nInductor Selection and Maximum Output Current  section). \nIt is also important to note that slope compensation is set \nby the R T value. When the synchronization frequency is \nmuch higher than the one set by R T, the slope compensa -\ntion is significantly reduced, which may require a larger \ninductor value to prevent sub-harmonic oscillation.\nFor duty cycles greater than 50% (V OUT/VIN > 0.5), a \nminimum inductance is required to avoid sub-harmonic \noscillations :\n  LMIN=VOUT+VLS ( )•0.42MHz\nƒSW\nwhere V LS is the voltage drop of the low side switch \n(0.12V  at maximum load), ƒ SW is in MHz, and L MIN is in \nμH. For ƒ SW in the above calculation, use the frequency \nprogrammed by R T, not the synchronization frequency.\nUndervoltage Lockout\nFigure\xa010  shows how to add undervoltage lockout (UVLO) \nto the LT3690 . Typically, UVLO is used in situations where \nthe input supply is current limited, or has a relatively high \nsource resistance. A switching regulator draws constant \npower from the source, so source current increases as \nsource voltage drops. This looks like a negative resistance \nload to the source and can cause the source to current \n3690 F10L T3690 VINVIN\nSLEEPUVLO2µA\n1.25V R4 C4+\n–R3\nFigure\xa010.

This feature \ncan be used to prevent excessive discharge of battery-\noperated systems. If an adjustable UVLO threshold is \nrequired, the UVLO pin can be used. The threshold voltage \nof the UVLO pin comparator is 1.25V . Current hysteresis \nis added above the UVLO threshold. This can be used to \nset voltage hysteresis of the UVLO using the following \nequations :\n  R3=VH–VL\n2µA\nR4=R3•1\nVH\n1.25V–1\nExample : switching should not start until the input is \nabove 4.4V, and is to stop if the input falls below 4V.\n  R3=4.4V–4.0V\n2µA=200kΩ\nR4=200kΩ•1\n4.4V\n1.25V–1=79.4kΩAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nKeep the connection from the resistor to the UVLO pin \nshort and  minimize the interplane or surface capacitance \nto switching nodes. If high resistor values are used, the \nUVLO pin should be bypassed with a 1nF capacitor to \nprevent coupling problems from the switch node.\nShorted and Reversed Input Protection\nIf the inductor is chosen to prevent excessive saturation, \nthe LT3690  will tolerate a shorted output. When operat -\ning in short-circuit condition, the LT3690  will reduce its \nfrequency until the valley current is at a typical value of 5A \n(see Figure\xa011 ). There is another situation to consider in \nsystems where the output is held high when the input to \nthe LT3690  is absent. This may occur in battery charging \napplications or in battery backup systems where a battery \nor some other supply is diode ORed with the LT3690 ’s \noutput. If the V IN pin is allowed to float and the EN pin \nis held high (either by a logic signal or because it is tied \nto V IN), then the LT3690 ’s internal circuitry will pull its \nquiescent current through its SW pin. This is acceptable if \nthe system can tolerate a few mA in this state. If the EN pin \nis grounded, the SW pin current will drop to essentially \nzero. However , if the V IN pin is grounded while the output \nis held high, then parasitic diodes inside the LT3690  can \npull large currents from the output through the SW pin \nand the V IN pin. Figure\xa012  shows a circuit that will run \nonly when the input voltage is present and that protects \nagainst a shorted or reversed input.\nFigure\xa011.

Figure\xa013  \nshows the recommended component placement with \ntrace, ground plane and via locations. Note that large, \nswitched currents flow in the LT3690 ’s VIN, SW and GND \npins and the input capacitor (C IN). The loop formed by \nthese components should be as small as possible. These \ncomponents, along with the inductor and output capacitor , \nshould be placed on the same side of the circuit board, \nand their connections should be made on that layer . Place \na local, unbroken ground plane below these components. \nThe SW and BST nodes should be small as possible. If \nsynchronizing the part externally using the SYNC pin, \navoid routing this signal near sensitive nodes, especially \nVC and FB. Finally, keep the FB and V C nodes small so \nthat the ground traces will shield them from the SW and \nBST nodes. The exposed GND pad on the bottom of the \npackage must be soldered to ground so that the pad acts \nas a heat sink. To keep thermal resistance low, extend the \nground plane as much as possible, and add thermal vias \nunder and near the LT3690  to additional ground planes \nwithin the circuit board and on the bottom side. In addi -\ntion, the exposed SW pad on the bottom of the package \nmust be soldered to the PCB to act as a heat sink for the \nlow side switch. Add thermal vias under the SW pad and \nto the bottom side.High Temperature Considerations\nThe PCB must provide heat sinking to keep the LT3690  \ncool. The GND exposed pad on the bottom of the package \nmust be soldered to a ground plane and the SW exposed \npad must be soldered to a SW plane. Tie the ground plane \nand SW plane to large copper layers below with ther -\nmal vias ; these layers will spread the heat dissipated by \nthe LT3690 . Placing additional vias can reduce thermal \nresistance further . With these steps, the thermal resis -\ntance from die (or junction) to ambient can be reduced \nto θJA = 40°C/W or less. With 100 LFPM airflow, this \nresistance can fall by another 25%. Further increases in \nairflow will lead to lower thermal resistance. Because of \nthe large output current capability of the LT3690 , it is \npossible to dissipate enough heat to raise the junction \ntemperature beyond the absolute maximum of 125°C \n(150°C for H-grade or MP-grade). When operating at \nhigh ambient temperatures, the maximum load current \nshould be derated as the ambient temperature approaches \nthe maximum junction temperature. Power dissipa -\ntion within the LT3690  can be estimated by calculating \nthe total power loss from an efficiency measurement.  \nThe die temperature is calculated by multiplying the \nLT3690  power dissipation by the thermal resistance from \njunction-to-ambient. Thermal resistance depends on the \nlayout of the circuit board, but values from 20°C/W to \n60°C/W are typical. Die temperature rise was measured \non a 4-layer , 6cm • 6cm circuit board in still air at a load \ncurrent of 4A (ƒSW = 600kHz ). For a 12V input to 3.3V \noutput the die temperature elevation above ambient was \n43°C; for 24V IN to 3.3V OUT the rise was 52°C; for 12V IN \nto 5VOUT the rise was 55°C and for 24V IN to 5VOUT the \nrise was 62°C.\nOther Analog Devices Publications\nApplication Notes 19, 35 and 44 contain detailed descrip -\ntions and design information for buck regulators and other \nswitching regulators.
