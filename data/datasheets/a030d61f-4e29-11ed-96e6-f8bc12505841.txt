It is designed for balanced data transmission and complies with EIA standards RS-485 and RS-422. The part contains a differential line driver and a differential line receiver. Both the driver and the receiver can be enabled independently. \nWhen disabled, the outputs are three-stated. \nThe ADM485 operates from a single 5 V power supply. \nExcessive power dissipation caused by bus contention or by \noutput shorting is prevented by a thermal shutdown circuit. If \nduring fault conditions, a significant temperature increase is detected in the internal driver circuitry, this feature forces the \ndriver output into a high impedance state. \nUp to 32 transceivers can be connected simultaneously on a \nbus, but only one driver should be enabled at any time. It is important, therefore, that the remaining disabled drivers do not \nload the bus. To ensure this, the ADM485 driver features high \noutput impedance when disabled and when powered down, which minimizes the loading effect when the transceiver is not being used. The high impedance driver output is maintained over the common-mode voltage range of −7 V to +12 V .The receiver contains a fail-safe feature that results in a logic high output state if the inputs are unconnected (floating). \nThe ADM485 is fabricated on BiCMOS, an advanced mixed \ntechnology process combining low power CMOS with fast \nswitching bipolar technology. All inputs and outputs contain protection against ESD; all driver outputs feature high source and sink current capability. An epitaxial layer is used to guard \nagainst latch-up. \nThe ADM485 features extremely fast switching speeds. Minimal \ndriver propagation delays permit transmission at data rates up to 5 Mbps while low skew minimizes EMI interference. \nThe part is fully specified over the commercial and industrial \ntemperature range and is available in 8-lead PDIP , 8-lead SOIC, \nand small footprint, 8-lead MSOP packages. \n \nADM485  \n \nRev.

F | Page 12 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nDIFFERENTIAL DATA TRANSMISSION \nDifferential data transmission is used to reliably transmit data at \nhigh rates over long distances and through noisy environments. \nDifferential transmission nullifies the effects of ground shifts and noise signals that appear as common-mode voltages on the \nline. There are two main standards approved by the EIA that \nspecify the electrical characteristics of transceivers used in \ndifferential data transmission. \nThe RS-422 standard specifies data rates up to 10 MBaud and \nline lengths up to 4000 ft. A single driver can drive a transmission \nline with up to 10 receivers. \nTo cater to true multipoint communications, the RS-485 \nstandard was defined. This standard meets or exceeds all the requirements of RS-422 but also allows for up to 32 drivers and \n32 receivers to be connected to a single bus. An extended common-\nmode range of −7 V to +12 V is defined. The most significant difference between the RS-422 standard and the RS-485 standard is the fact that the drivers can be disabled, thereby allowing more than one (32 in fact) to be connected to a single line. Only one driver should be enabled at a time, but the RS-485 standard \ncontains additional specifications to guarantee device safety in \nthe event of line contention. \nTable 7. Comparison of RS-422 and RS-485 Interface Standards \nSpecification  RS-422  RS-485  \nTransmission Type  Differential  Differential  \nMaximum Cable Length  4000 ft.  4000 ft.  \nMinimum Driver Output Voltage  ±2 V  ±1.5 V  \nDriver Load Impedance  100 Ω  54 Ω  \nReceiver Input Resistance  4 kΩ min  12 kΩ min  \nReceiver Input Sensitivity  ±200 mV  ±200 mV  \nReceiver Input Voltage Range  −7 V to +7 V  −7 V to +12 V \nNo. of Drivers/Receivers per Line  1/10  32/32  \n \nCABLE AND DATA RATE \nThe transmission line of choice for RS-485 communications is  \na twisted pair. Twisted pair cable tends to cancel common-mode \nnoise and causes cancellation of the magnetic fields generated by the current flowing through each wire, thereby reducing the \neffective inductance of the pair. \nThe ADM485 is designed for bidirectional data communications \non multipoint transmission lines. A typical application showing a multipoint transmission network is illustrated in \nFigure 30 . \nAn RS-485 transmission line can have as many as 32 transceivers on the bus. Only one driver can transmit at a particular time, \nbut multiple receivers can be enabled simultaneously.  \nRT RT\nD\nR\nDDR RD\nR\n00078-030 \nFigure 30. Typical RS-485 Network \nAs with any transmission line, it is important that reflections be \nminimized. This can be achieved by terminating the extreme ends of the line using resistors equal to the characteristic impedance of the line. Stub lengths of the main line should also be kept as short as possible. A properly terminated transmission line appears \npurely resistive to the driver. \nTHERMAL SHUTDOWN \nThe ADM485 contains thermal shutdown circuitry that protects \nthe part from excessive power dissipation during fault conditions. \nShorting the driver outputs to a low impedance source can result \nin high driver currents. The thermal sensing circuitry detects the increase in die temperature and disables the driver outputs. The thermal sensing circuitry is designed to disable the driver outputs when a die temperature of 150°C is reached. As the device cools, the drivers are re-enabled at 140°C. \nPROPAGATION DELAY \nThe ADM485 features very low propagation delay, ensuring \nmaximum baud rate operation. The driver is well balanced, \nensuring distortion free transmission. \nAnother important specification is a measure of the skew \nbetween the complementary outputs. Excessive skew impairs the noise immunity of the system and increases the amount of \nelectromagnetic interference (EMI). \nRECEIVER OPEN CIRCUIT, FAIL-SAFE \nThe receiver input includes a fail-safe feature that guarantees a \nlogic high on the receiver when the inputs are open circuit or \nfloating. \n \n   ADM485\n \nRev.

**Description:**
The ADM485 is a low-power, high-speed differential line transceiver designed for bidirectional data communication on multipoint bus transmission lines. It integrates both a differential line driver and a differential line receiver, allowing for balanced data transmission. The device operates from a single 5 V power supply and features thermal shutdown protection to prevent excessive power dissipation during fault conditions.

**Typical Applications:**
The ADM485 is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Low power RS-485 communication systems
- Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Communication Equipment (DCE) interfaces
- Packet switching networks
- Local Area Networks (LANs)
- Data concentration and multiplexing
- Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) systems

This component is particularly suitable for environments where reliable data transmission is required over long distances and through noisy conditions, making it ideal for industrial and commercial communication systems.
