The GATE pin pulls high, enhanc -\ning the N-channel MOSFET when the load current creates \nmore than 25mV of voltage drop across the MOSFET . \nWhen the load current is small, the gate is actively driven \nto maintain 25mV across the MOSFET . If reverse current \ndevelops more than –25mV of voltage drop across the \nMOSFET , a fast pull-down circuit quickly connects the \nGATE pin to the IN pin, turning off the MOSFET .\nGND:  Device Ground.\nIN: Input Voltage and GATE Fast Pull-Down Return. IN is \nthe anode of the ideal diode and connects to the source \nof the N-channel MOSFET . The voltage sensed at this pin is used to control the source-drain voltage across the \nMOSFET . The GATE fast pull-down current is returned \nthrough the IN pin. Connect this pin as close as possible \nto the MOSFET source.\nNC: No Connection. Not internally connected.\nOUT : Drain Voltage Sense. OUT is the cathode of the ideal \ndiode and the common output when multiple L TC4357s \nare configured as an ideal diode-OR. It connects to the \ndrain of the N-channel MOSFET . The voltage sensed at \nthis pin is used to control the source-drain voltage across \nthe MOSFET .\nVDD: Positive Supply Input. The L TC4357 is powered from \nthe V DD pin. Connect this pin to OUT either directly or \nthrough an RC hold-up circuit.\n4357 BDCHARGE PUMP\n– +– +\n+–FPD\nCOMPGATE\nAMP\n25mV 25mVIN GATE\n17VOUT\nGNDINVDD\n+–block Diagra M\nLTC4357\n\x184357fdoperation\nHigh availability systems often employ parallel-connected \npower supplies or battery feeds to achieve redundancy \nand enhance system reliability. ORing diodes have been \na popular means of connecting these supplies at the point \nof load. The disadvantage of this approach is the forward \nvoltage drop and resulting efficiency loss. This drop reduces \nthe available supply voltage and dissipates significant \npower . Using an N-channel MOSFET to replace a Schottky \ndiode reduces the power dissipation and eliminates the \nneed for costly heat sinks or large thermal layouts in high \npower applications.\nThe L TC4357 controls an external N-channel MOSFET to \nform an ideal diode. The voltage across the source and \ndrain is monitored by the IN and OUT pins, and the GATE \npin drives the MOSFET to control its operation. In effect \nthe MOSFET source and drain serve as the anode and \ncathode of an ideal diode.\nAt power-up, the load current initially flows through the \nbody diode of the MOSFET . The resulting high forward voltage is detected at the IN and OUT pins, and the \nL TC4357 drives the GATE pin to servo the forward drop \nto 25mV . If the load current causes more than 25mV of \nvoltage drop when the MOSFET gate is driven fully on, \nthe forward voltage is equal to R DS(ON)  • ILOAD.\nIf the load current is reduced causing the forward drop \nto fall below 25mV , the MOSFET gate is driven lower by \na weak pull-down in an attempt to maintain the drop at \n25mV . If the load current reverses and the voltage across \nIN to OUT is more negative than –25mV the L TC4357 \nresponds by pulling the MOSFET gate low with a strong \npull-down.\nIn the event of a power supply failure, such as if the output \nof a fully loaded supply is suddenly shorted to ground, \nreverse current temporarily flows through the MOSFET that \nis on. This current is sourced from any load capacitance \nand from the other supplies. The L TC4357 quickly responds \nto this condition turning off the MOSFET in about 500ns, \nthus minimizing the disturbance to the output bus.\nMOSFET Selection\nThe L TC4357 drives an N-channel MOSFET to conduct \nthe load current. The important features of the MOSFET \nare on-resistance, R DS(ON) , the maximum drain-source \nvoltage, V DSS, and the gate threshold voltage. \nGate drive is compatible with 4.5V logic-level MOSFETs \nin low voltage applications (V DD = 9V to 20V). At higher \nvoltages (V DD = 20V to 80V) standard 10V threshold MOS -\nFETs may be used. An internal clamp limits the gate drive \nto 15V between the GATE and IN pins. An external Zener \nclamp may be added between GATE and IN for MOSFETs \nwith a V GS(MAX)  of less than 15V .\nThe maximum allowable drain-source voltage, BV DSS, \nmust be higher than the power supply voltage. If an input \nis connected to GND, the full supply voltage will appear \nacross the MOSFET . ORing T wo-Supply Outputs\nWhere L TC4357s are used to combine the outputs of two \npower supplies, the supply with the highest output voltage \nsources most or all of the load current. If this supply’s \noutput is quickly shorted to ground while delivering load \ncurrent, the flow of current temporarily reverses and \nflows backwards through the L TC4357’s MOSFET . When \nthe reverse current produces a voltage drop across the \nMOSFET of more than –25mV , the L TC4357’s fast pull-down \nactivates and quickly turns off the MOSFET .\nIf the other , initially lower , supply was not delivering load \ncurrent at the time of the fault, the output falls until the \nbody diode of its ORing MOSFET conducts. Meanwhile, \nthe L TC4357 charges its MOSFET gate with 20µA until the \nforward drop is reduced to 25mV . If instead this supply was \ndelivering load current at the time of the fault, its associ -\nated ORing MOSFET was already driven at least partially \non, and the L TC4357 will simply drive the MOSFET gate \nharder in an effort to maintain a drop of 25mV .applications inForMation\nLTC4357\n\x184357fdapplications inForMation\nFigure 1.

Load current is first taken from the highest \noutput, with the low outputs contributing as the output \nvoltage falls under increased loading. The 25mV regulation \ntechnique ensures smooth load sharing between outputs \nwithout oscillation. The degree of sharing is a function of \nRDS(ON) , the output impedance of the supplies and their \ninitial output voltages.Input Short-Circuit Faults\nThe dynamic behavior of an active, ideal diode entering \nreverse bias is most accurately characterized by a delay \nfollowed by a period of reverse recovery. During the delay \nphase some reverse current is built up, limited by parasitic \nresistances and inductances. During the reverse recovery \nphase, energy stored in the parasitic inductances is trans -\nferred to other elements in the circuit. Current slew rates \nduring reverse recovery may reach 100A/µs or higher . \nHigh slew rates coupled with parasitic inductances in se -\nries with the input and output paths may cause potentially \ndestructive transients to appear at the IN and OUT pins \nof the L TC4357 during reverse recovery. A zero imped -\nance short-circuit directly across the input of the circuit \nis especially troublesome because it permits the highest \npossible reverse current to build up during the delay phase. \nWhen the MOSFET finally commutates the reverse current \nthe L TC4357 IN pin experiences a negative voltage spike, \nwhile the OUT pin spikes in the positive direction.\nTo prevent damage to the L TC4357 under conditions of \ninput short-circuit, protect the IN pin and OUT pin as \nshown in Figure 2. The IN pin is protected by clamping \nto the GND pin in the negative direction. Protect the OUT \npin with a clamp, such as with a TVS or T ransZorb, or with \na local bypass capacitor of at least 10µF . In low voltage \napplications the MOSFET\'s drain-source breakdown may \nbe sufficient to protect the OUT pin, provided BV DSS + \nVIN < 100V .\nParasitic inductance between the load bypass and the \nL TC4357 allows a zero impedance input short to collapse \nthe voltage at the V DD pin, which increases the total turn-off \ntime (t OFF). For applications up to 30V , bypass the V DD pin \nwith 39µF; above 30V use at least 100µF . If V DD is powered \nfrom the output side, one capacitor serves to guard against \nVDD collapse and also protect OUT from voltage spikes. \nIf the OUT pin is protected by a diode clamp or if V DD is \npowered from the input side, decouple the V DD pin with a \nseparate 100Ω, 100nF filter (see Figure 3). In applications \nabove 10A increase the filter capacitor to 1µF .\nLTC4357\n\x184357fdDesign Example\nThe following design example demonstrates the calcula -\ntions involved for selecting components in a 12V system \nwith 10A maximum load current (see Figure 4).\nFirst, calculate the R DS(ON)  of the MOSFET to achieve the de -\nsired forward drop at full load. Assuming V DROP = 0.1V,\n  RDS(ON)≤VDROP\nILOAD=0.1V\n10A\nRDS(ON)≤10mΩ\nThe Si4874DY offers a good solution, in an S8 package \nwith R DS(ON)  = 10m Ω(max) and BV DSS of 30V .\nThe maximum power dissipation in the MOSFET is: \n P = I LOAD2 • RDS(ON)  = (10A)2 • 10m Ω = 1W\nWith less than 39µF of local bypass, the recommended RC \nvalues of 100 Ω and 0.1µF were used in Figure 4.\nSince BV DSS + VIN is much less than 100V , output clamp -\ning is unnecessary.Figure 3.
