The low ON-state resistance (R ON) \nof the switch allows connections to be made with \nminimal propagation delay. When EN is high, the \ntranslator switch is ON, and the SCL1 and SDA1 \nI/O are connected to the SCL2 and SDA2 I/O, \nrespectively, allowing bidirectional data flow between \nports. When EN is low, the translator switch is off, and \na high-impedance state exists between ports.\nIn addition to voltage translation, the PCA9306 device \ncan be used to isolate a 400-kHz bus from a 100-kHz \nbus by controlling the EN pin to disconnect the slower \nbus during fast-mode communication.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nPCA9306SSOP (8) 2.95 mm x 2.80 mm\nVSSOP (8) 2.30 mm x 2.00 mm\nX2SON (8) 1.40 mm x 1.00 mm\nDSBGA (8) 1.98 mm x 0.98 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the datasheet.\nPCA9306VREF2200 N\x9f\x03\nEN\nSCL1\nSDA1SCL2\nSDA2VREF1\nI2C or SMBus\ncontroller\n(processor)I2C target devices\nGND\nSimplified Application DiagramPCA9306\nSCPS113N  – OCTOBER 2004 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The voltage supply range for V REF1 is 1.2 V to 3.3 V and the supply \nrange for V REF2 is 1.8 V to 5.5 V.\nThe PCA9306 device can also be used to run two buses, one at 400-kHz operating frequency and the other at \n100-kHz operating frequency. If the two buses are operating at different frequencies, the 100-kHz bus must be \ndisconnected by using the EN pin when the 400-kHz operation of the main bus is required. If the controller is \nrunning at 400 kHz, the maximum system operating frequency may be less than 400 kHz because of the delays \nadded by the level shifter.\nIn I2C applications, the bus capacitance limit of 400 pF restricts the number of devices and bus length. The \ncapacitive load on both sides of the PCA9306 device must be taken into account when approximating the total \nload of the system, ensuring the sum of both sides is under 400 pF.\nBoth the SDA and SCL channels of the PCA9306 device have the same electrical characteristics, and there \nis minimal deviation from one output to another in voltage or propagation delay. This is a benefit over discrete-\ntransistor voltage-translation solutions, because the fabrication of the switch is symmetrical. The translator \nprovides excellent ESD protection to lower-voltage devices and at the same time protects less-ESD-resistant \ndevices.\n8.1.1 Definition of threshold voltage\nThis document references a threshold voltage denoted as V th, which appears multiple times throughout this \ndocument when discussing the NFET between V REF1 and V REF2. The value of V th is approximately 0.6 V at room \ntemperature.\n8.1.2 Correct Device Set Up\nIn a normal set up shown in Figure 8-1 , the enable pin and V REF2 are shorted together and tied to a 200-k Ω \nresistor, and a reference voltage equal to V REF1 plus the FET threshold voltage is established. This reference \nvoltage is used to help pass lows from one side to another more effectively while still separating the different pull \nup voltages on both sides.\n200 k\x9f\x03\nRPU RPU\nRPU RPU\nVREF2 VREF1VCC1 = +1.8 V\nVgs+\n-VCC2 = +3.3 V\nSDA2\nSCL1SDA1\nSCL2VCC1 < V CC2Normal Setup\n+1.8 V + V TH\nIREF2 = 4 µAEN\nFigure 8-1. Normal Setup\nCare should be taken to ensure V REF2 has an external resistor tied between it and V CC2. If V REF2 is tied \ndirectly to the V CC2 rail without a resistor, then there is no external resistance from the V CC2 to V CC1 to limit \nthe current such as in Figure 8-2 . This effectively looks like a low impedance path for current to travel through \nand potentially break the pass FET if the current flowing through the pass FET is larger than the absolute PCA9306\nSCPS113N – OCTOBER 2004 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9306\nmaximum continuous channel current specified in section 6.1. The continuous channel current is larger with a \nhigher voltage difference between V CC1 and V CC2.\nFigure 8-2  shows an improper set up. If V CC2 is larger than V CC1 but less than V th, the impedance between V CC1 \nand V CC2 is high resulting in a low drain to source current, which does not cause damage to the device. Concern \narises when V CC2 becomes larger than V CC1 by V th. During this event, the NFET turns on and begin to conduct \ncurrent. This current is dependent on the gate to source voltage and drain to source voltage.\n200k \x9f\x03\nRPU RPU\nRPU RPU\nVREF2 VREF1VCC1 = +1.8 V\nVgs+\n-VCC2 = +3.3 V\nSDA2\nSCL1SDA1\nSCL2VCC1 < V CC2Abnormal Setup\nEN\nFigure 8-2. Abnormal Setup\n8.1.3 Disconnecting an I2C target from the Main I2C Bus Using the EN Pin\nPCA9306 can be used as a switch to disconnect one side of the device from the main I2C bus. This can be \nadvantageous in multiple situations. One instance of this situation is if there are devices on the I2C bus which \nonly supports fast mode (400 kHz) while other devices on the bus support fast mode plus (1 MHz). An example \nof this is displayed in Figure 8-3 .\n3.3 V I2C bus \n(1 MHz)PCA93063.3 V I2C bus \n(400 kHz)\nEN\nGPIO\nNote: GPIO logic high must not \nexceed 3.3 V +Vth in this example\nFigure 8-3. Example of an I2C bus with multiple supported frequencies\nIn this situation, if the controller is on the 1 MHz side then communicating at 1 MHz should not be attempted \nif PCA9306 were enabled. It needs to be disabled for PCA9306 to avoid possibly glitching state machines \nin devices which were designed to operate correctly at 400 kHz or slower. When PCA9306 is disabled, the \ncontroller can communicate with the 1 MHz devices without disturbing the 400 kHz bus. When the PCA9306 is \nenabled, communication across both sides at 400 kHz is acceptable.\n8.1.4 Supporting Remote Board Insertion to Backplane with PCA9306\nAnother situation where PCA9306 is advantageous when using its enable feature is when a remote board with \nI2C lines needs to be attached to a main board (backplane) with an I2C bus such as in Figure 8-4 . If connecting \na remote board to a backplane is not done properly, the connection could result in data corruption during a \ntransaction or the insertion could generate an unintended pulse on the SCL line. Which could glitch an I2C \ndevice state machine causing the I2C bus to get stuck.www.ti.comPCA9306\nSCPS113N – OCTOBER 2004 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9306\nMain Board\n3.3 V I2C bus PCA9306 3.3 V I2C bus\nEN\nGPIO\nNote: GPIO logic high must not \nexceed 3.3 V +Vth in this exampleRemote BoardFigure 8-4. An example of connecting a remote board to a main board (backplane)\nPCA9306 can be used to support this application because it can be disabled while making the connection. Then \nit is enabled once the remote board is powered on and the buses on both sides are IDLE.\n8.1.5 Switch Configuration\nPCA9306 has the capability of being used with its V REF1 voltage equal to V REF2. This essentially turns the device \nfrom a translator to a device which can be used as a switch, and in some situations this can be useful. The \nswitch configuration is shown in Figure 8-5  and translation mode is shown in Figure 8-6 .\nPCA9306Vref2\nSwitch Configuration: Vref1 = Vref2 and \nEnable is controlled by a GPIO200 kVCC1\nENGPIO: high logic does not \nexceed Vref2 + Vth\nSCL1VCC2\nSDA1RVCC2\nSCL2\nSDA2Vref1VCC2\nR RWhere Vcc2 = Vcc1\nVCC1 VCC1\nFigure 8-5.

Translation Configuration\nWhen PCA9306 is in the switch configuration (V REF1 = V REF2), the propagation delays are different compared \nto the translator configuration. Taking a look at the propagation delays, if the pull up resistance and capacitance \non both sides of the bus are equal, then in switch mode the PCA9306 has the same propagation delay from \nside one to two and side two to one. The propagation delays become lower when V CC1/VCC2 is larger. For PCA9306\nSCPS113N – OCTOBER 2004 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9306\nexample, the propagation delay at 1.8 V is longer than at 5 V in the switching configuration. When PCA9306 is \nin translation mode, side one propagate lows to side two faster than side two can propagate lows to side 1. This \ntime difference becomes larger the larger the difference between V CC2 and V CC1 becomes.\n8.1.6 Controller on Side 1 or Side 2 of Device\nI2C and SMBus are bidirectional protocol meaning devices on the bus can both transmit and receive data. \nPCA9306 was designed to allow for signals to be able to be transmitted from either side, thus allowing for the \ncontroller to be able to placed on either side of the device. Figure 8-7  shows the controller on side two as \nopposed to the diagram on page 1 of this data sheet.\nPCA9306Vref2200 kVCC1\nEN\nSCL1\nSDA1SCL2\nSDA2Vref1VCC2\nI2C target devicesI2C or SMBus \ncontroller (processor)\nFigure 8-7. Controller on side 2 of PCA9306\n8.1.7 LDO and PCA9306 Concerns\nThe V REF1 pin can be supplied by a low-dropout regulator (LDO), but in some cases the LDO may lose its \nregulation because of the bias current from V REF2 to V REF1. If the LDO cannot sink the bias current, then the \ncurrent has no other paths to ground and instead charges up the capacitance on the V REF1 node (both external \nand parasitic). This results in an increase in voltage on the V REF1 node. If no other paths for current to flow are \nestablished (such as back biasing of body diodes or clamping diodes through other devices on the V REF1 node), \nthen the V REF1 voltage ends up stabilizing when V gs of the pass FET is equal to V th. This means V REF1 node \nvoltage is V CC2 - V th. Note that any targets/controllers running off of the LDO now see the V CC2 - V th voltage \nwhich may cause damage to those targets/controllers if they are not rated to handle the increased voltage.\nVgs+\n-\nVREF1\npinVREF2\npinPCA9306VCC1 < V CC2\nEN200 k\x9f\x03VCC2 = +3.3 V\nVen = Vref1 + V TH\nVREF1 = Vcc2 - Vth+\n- LDO Vout\nCREF1Ibias = (Vcc2 ±\x03Ven) / 200 kTranslator Setup with Vref1 \nprovided by LDO and no path \nfor bias current\nFigure 8-8.

Block Diagram of PCA9306\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Enable (EN) Pin\nThe PCA9306 device is a double-pole, single-throw switch in which the gate of the transistors is controlled by the \nvoltage on the EN pin. In Figure 9-1 , the PCA9306 device is always enabled when power is applied to V REF2. In \nFigure 9-2 , the device is enabled when a control signal from a processor is in a logic-high state.\n8.3.2 Voltage Translation\nThe primary feature of the PCA9306 device is translating voltage from an I2C bus referenced to V REF1 up to \nan I2C bus referenced to V DPU, to which V REF2 is connected through a 200-k Ω pullup resistor. Translation on a \nstandard, open-drain I2C bus is achieved by simply connecting pullup resistors from SCL1 and SDA1 to V REF1 \nand connecting pullup resistors from SCL2 and SDA2 to V DPU. Information on sizing the pullup resistors can be \nfound in the Sizing Pullup Resistors  section.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nINPUT\nEN(1) TRANSLATOR FUNCTION\nHLogic Lows are propagated from one side to the other, Logic Highs blocked (independent \npull up resistors passively drive the line high)\nL Disconnect\n(1) The SCL switch conducts if EN is ≥ 0.6 V higher than SCL1 or SCL2.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\n9.1.1 General Applications of I2C\nAs with the standard I2C system, pullup resistors are required to provide the logic-high levels on the translator \nbus. The size of these pullup resistors depends on the system, but each side of the repeater must have a pullup \nresistor. The device is designed to work with standard-mode and fast-mode I2C devices in addition to SMBus \ndevices. Standard-mode I2C devices only specify 3 mA in a generic I2C system where standard-mode devices \nand multiple controllers are possible. Under certain conditions, high termination currents can be used. When \nthe SDA1 or SDA2 port is low, the clamp is in the ON state, and a low-resistance connection exists between \nthe SDA1 and SDA2 ports. Assuming the higher voltage is on the SDA2 port when the SDA2 port is high, \nthe voltage on the SDA1 port is limited to the voltage set by V REF1. When the SDA1 port is high, the SDA2 \nport is pulled to the pullup supply voltage of the drain (V DPU) by the pullup resistors. This functionality allows a \nseamless translation between higher and lower voltages selected by the user, without the need for directional \ncontrol. The SCL1-SCL2 channel also functions in the same way as the SDA1-SDA2 channel.\n9.2 Typical Application\nFigure 9-1  and Figure 9-2  show how these pullup resistors are connected in a typical application, as well as two \noptions for connecting the EN pin.\n12\n3\n4 5678\nSW\nSWV = 1.8 VREF1V = 3.3 VDPU\nI C Bus2\nControllerI C Bus2\nDeviceVREF1 VREF2EN\nVCCVCCPCA9306\nGND GND GNDSDASDA1 SDA2200 k Ω\nSCL1\nSCL SCL\nSDASCL2RPU RPURPU RPU\nFigure 9-1.

This allows V REF2 to regulate the EN input. A 100-pF filter capacitor connected to V REF2 is \nrecommended. The I2C bus controller output can be push-pull or open-drain (pullup resistors may be required) \nand the I2C bus device output can be open-drain (pullup resistors are required to pull the SCL2 and SDA2 \noutputs to V DPU). However, if either output is push-pull, data must be unidirectional or the outputs must be \n3-state capable and be controlled by some direction-control mechanism to prevent high-to-low contentions in \neither direction. If both outputs are open-drain, no direction control is needed.\n9.2.2.2 Sizing Pullup Resistors\nTo get an estimate for the range of values that can be used for the pullup resistor, please refer to the application \nnote SLVA689.  Figure 9-3  and Figure 9-4  respectively show the maximum and minimum pullup resistance \nallowable by the I2C specification for standard-mode (100 kHz) and fast-mode (400 kHz) operation.www.ti.comPCA9306\nSCPS113N – OCTOBER 2004 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9306\n9.2.2.3 PCA9306 Bandwidth\nThe maximum frequency of the PCA9306 device depends on the application. The device can operate at speeds \nof > 100 MHz given the correct conditions. The maximum frequency is dependent upon the loading of the \napplication.\nFigure 6-3  shows a bandwidth measurement of the PCA9306 device using a two-port network analyzer.\nHowever, this is an analog type of measurement. For digital applications, the signal should not degrade up to the \nfifth harmonic of the digital signal. As a rule of thumb, the frequency bandwidth should be at least five times the \nmaximum digital clock rate. This component of the signal is very important in determining the overall shape of \nthe digital signal. In the case of the PCA9306 device, digital clock frequency of >100 MHz can be achieved.\nThe PCA9306 device does not provide any drive capability like the PCA9515 or PCA9517 series of devices. \nTherefore, higher-frequency applications require higher drive strength from the host side. No pullup resistor is \nneeded on the host side (3.3 V) if the PCA9306 device is being driven by standard CMOS push-pull output \ndriver. Ideally, it is best to minimize the trace length from the PCA9306 device on the sink side (1.8 V) to \nminimize signal degradation.\nYou can then use a simple formula to compute the maximum practical  frequency component or the knee \nfrequency (f knee). All fast edges have an infinite spectrum of frequency components. However, there is an \ninflection (or knee ) in the frequency spectrum of fast edges where frequency components higher than f knee are \ninsignificant in determining the shape of the signal.\nTo calculate f knee:\nfknee= 0.5 / RT (10%–90%) (7)\nfknee = 0.4 / RT (20%–80%) (8)\nFor signals with rise-time characteristics based on 10- to 90-percent thresholds, f knee is equal to 0.5 divided by \nthe rise time of the signal. For signals with rise-time characteristics based on 20- to 80-percent thresholds, which \nis very common in many current device specifications, f knee is equal to 0.4 divided by the rise time of the signal.\nSome guidelines to follow that help maximize the performance of the device:\n•Keep trace length to a minimum by placing the PCA9306 device close to the I2C output of the processor.\n•The trace length should be less than half the time of flight to reduce ringing and line reflections or non-\nmonotonic behavior in the switching region.\n•To reduce overshoots, a pullup resistor can be added on the 1.8 V side; be aware that a slower fall time is to \nbe expected.PCA9306\nSCPS113N – OCTOBER 2004 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9306\n9.2.3 Application Curve\nCb (pF)Rp(max)  (kOhm)\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 4500510152025\nD008Standard-mode\nFast-mode\nStandard mode Fast mode\n(fSCL = 100 kHz, t r = 1 μs) (fSCL = 400 kHz, t r = 300 ns)\nFigure 9-3.

Failure to have a \nhigh-impedance resistor between V REF2 and V DPU results in excessive current draw and unreliable device \noperation. It is also worth noting, that in order to support voltage translation, the PCA9306 must have the EN and \nVREF2 pins shorted and then pulled up to V DPU through a high-impedance resistor.PCA9306\nSCPS113N – OCTOBER 2004 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: PCA9306\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nFor printed-circuit board (PCB) layout of the PCA9306 device, common PCB layout practices should be followed, \nbut additional concerns related to high-speed data transfer such as matched impedances and differential pairs \nare not a concern for I2C signal speeds.\nIn all PCB layouts, it is a best practice to avoid right angles in signal traces, to fan out signal traces away from \neach other on leaving the vicinity of an integrated circuit (IC), and to use thicker trace widths to carry higher \namounts of current that commonly pass through power and ground traces. The 100-pF filter capacitor should be \nplaced as close to V REF2 as possible. A larger decoupling capacitor can also be used, but a longer time constant \nof two capacitors and the 200-k Ω resistor results in longer turnon and turnoff times for the PCA9306 device. \nThese best practices are shown in Figure 11-1 .\nFor the layout example provided in Figure 11-1 , it would be possible to fabricate a PCB with only two layers by \nusing the top layer for signal routing and the bottom layer as a split plane for power (V CC) and ground (GND). \nHowever, a four-layer board is preferable for boards with higher-density signal routing. On a four-layer PCB, \nit is common to route signals on the top and bottom layer, dedicate one internal layer to a ground plane, and \ndedicate the other internal layer to a power plane. In a board layout using planes or split planes for power and \nground, vias are placed directly next to the surface-mount component pad, which must attach to V CC or GND, \nand the via is connected electrically to the internal layer or the other side of the board. Vias are also used when \na signal trace must be routed to the opposite side of the board, but this technique is not demonstrated in Figure \n11-1.\n11.2 Layout Example\nFigure 11-1.
