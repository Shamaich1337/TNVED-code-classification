Figure 2  shows the typical bench \ncharacterization setup used to evaluate the ac performance of \nthe AD9265 or AD9255. It is critical that the signal sources used \nfor the analog input and clock have very low phase noise (<1 ps \nrms jitter) to realize the optimum performance of the signal chain. Proper filtering of the analog input signal to remove harmonics and lower the integrated or broadband noise at the input is necessary to achieve the specified noise performance. \nSee the Evaluation Board Software Quick Start Procedures  section \nto get started, and see Figure 15  to Figure 28  for the complete \nschematics and layout diagrams. These diagrams demonstrate \nthe routing and grounding techniques that should be applied at the system level when designing application boards using these \nconverters. \nPOWER SUPPLIES \nThis evaluation board comes with a wall-mountable switching \npower supply that provides a 6 V , 2 A maximum output. Connect \nthe supply to the rated 100 V ac to the 240 V ac wall outlet at \n47 Hz to 63 Hz. The output from the supply is provided through \na 2.1 mm inner diameter jack that connects to the printed circuit board (PCB) at P26. The 6 V supply is fused and conditioned on the PCB before connecting to the low dropout linear regulators (default configuration) that supply the proper bias to each of the various sections on the board.  \nThe evaluation board can be powered in a nondefault condition \nusing external bench power supplies. To do this, the P27, P28, \nP31, P30, P32, and P29 jumpers can be removed to disconnect the outputs from the on-board LDOs. This enables the user to bias each section of the board individually. Use P8 and P9 to connect a different supply for each section. A 1.8 V supply is \nneeded with a 1 A current capability for AVDD, SVDD, and \nDRVDD; however, it is recommended that separate supplies be used for both analog and digital domains. An additional supply is also required to supply 1.8 V for digital support circuitry on the board, 3V_DIG. This should also have a 1 A current capability \nand can be combined with DRVDD with little or no degradation in \nperformance.  Two additional supplies, 5V_AVDD and 3V_AVDD, are used to \nbias the optional input path amplifiers. If used, these supplies should each have a 1 A current capability. P18 is also necessary if \nan amp that requires a negative supply voltage is being used. \nA second optional power supply configuration allows the \nreplacement of the LDOs that supply the AVDD and DRVDD \nrails of the ADC with the ADP2108  step-down dc-to-dc converter. \nUsing this switching controller in place of the LDO regulators \nto power the AVDD and DRVDD supplies of the ADC allows customers to evaluate the performance of the ADC when \npowered by a more efficient regulator.  \nINPUT SIGNALS \nWhen connecting the clock and analog source, use clean signal \ngenerators with low phase noise, such as the Rohde & Schwarz SMA100A, HP 8644B signal generators, or an equivalent. Use a \n1 m shielded, RG-58, 50 Ω coaxial cable for connecting to the evaluation board. Enter the desired frequency and amplitude (see the Specifications section in the data sheet of the respective part). When connecting the analog input source, use of a multipole, narrow-band, band-pass filter with 50 Ω terminations is \nrecommended. Analog Devices, Inc., uses TTE and K&L \nMicrowave, Inc., band-pass filters. The filters should be \nconnected directly to the evaluation board.  \nIf an external clock source is used, it should also be supplied \nwith a clean signal generator as previously specified. Typically, most Analog Devices evaluation boards can accept ~2.8 V p-p or \n13 dBm sine wave input for the clock.  \nOUTPUT SIGNALS \nThe default setup uses the Analog Devices high speed converter \nevaluation platform (HSC-ADC-EV ALCZ) for data capture. The \nCMOS output signals are buffered through U2 and are routed \nthrough P2 to the FPGA on the data capture board. \n  \n \n \nUG-074 Evaluation Board User Guide\n \nRev. 0 | Page 4 of 28 \n6V DC\n2A MAXWALL OUTLET\n100V AC TO 240V AC\n47Hz TO 63Hz\nANALOG INPUTSIGNAL\nSYNTHESIZER\nSIGNAL\nSYNTHESIZER\nOPTIONAL CLOCK SOURCE\nPC\nRUNNING ADC\nANALYZER\nOR VISUAL ANALOG\nUSER SOFTWARESWITCHINGPOWERSUPPLY\nSWITCHING\nPOWERSUPPLY\n6V DC\n2A MAX\n08699-002 \nFigure 2.

A evaluation board. \nPower Circuitry \nConnect the switching power supply that is supplied in the \nevaluation kit between P26 and a rated 100 V ac to 240 V ac \nwall outlet at 47 Hz to 63 Hz.  \nAnalog Input  \nThe inputs on the evaluation board are set up for a double balun-\ncoupled analog input with a 50 Ω impedance. For the AD9265/ \nAD9255, the default analog input configuration supports analog input frequencies of up to ~250 MHz (see Figure 3 ). This input \nnetwork is optimized to support a wide frequency band. See the AD9265 and AD9255 data sheets for additional information on \nthe recommended networks for different input frequency ranges. \nOptionally, the analog input on the board can be configured to \nuse the ADL5562 , which is a 3.3 GHz ultralow distortion RF/IF \ndifferential amplifier. The ADL5562  component is included on \nthe evaluation board at U1. However, the path into and out of the ADL5562  can be configured in many different ways depending \non the application; therefore, the parts in the input and output path are left unpopulated. Users should see the ADL5562  data \nsheet for additional information on this part and for configuring the inputs and outputs. The ADL5562  is normally held in power-\ndown mode and can be enabled by adding a jumper on P19. The ADL5562  can also be substituted with the ADA4937-1  or \nthe ADA4938-1  to allow evaluation of these parts with the \nADC.  \nVREF \nVREF is set by default to 1.0 V with SENSE connected to AGND \nthrough a jumper connecting Pin 2 and Pin 3 on Header P5. \nThis causes the ADC to operate with the internal reference in the 2.0 V p-p differential full-scale range. The reference voltage \ncan be changed to 0.5 V for a 1.0 V p-p full-scale range by \nmoving the SENSE pin jumper connection on P5 from Pin 2 and Pin 3 to Pin 1 and Pin 2 (this connects the SENSE pin to \nthe VREF pin).  To use the programmable reference mode, a resistor divider can \nbe set up by installing R50 and R51. The jumper on P5 should be removed for this mode of operation. See the data sheet of the part for additional information on using the programmable reference mode. \nRBIAS \nRBIAS has a default setting of 10 kΩ (R68) to ground and is \nused to set the ADC core bias current. Note that using a resistor \nvalue other than a 10 kΩ, 1% resistor for RBIAS may degrade \nthe performance of the device. \nClock Circuitry \nThe AD9265/ AD9255 board is set by default to use an external \nclock generator. An external clock source capable of driving a \n50 Ω terminated input should be connected to J6. This board is shipped from Valpey Fisher with a low phase noise oscillator \ninstalled. The oscillator frequency is set to match the rated speed of \nthe part: 125 MHz, 105 MHz, or 80 MHz for the AD926 5/AD925 5. \nTo enable the oscillator, install P6, and to connect it into the clock path, add a 0 Ω resistor at C70. R25 should also be removed \nto remove the 50 Ω termination from the output of the oscillator. \nA differential LVPECL clock driver output can also be used to \nclock the ADC input using the AD9517-4  (U601). To place the \nAD9517-4  into the clock path, populate R28 and R29 with 0 Ω \nresistors and remove R30 and R31 to disconnect the default clock path inputs. In addition, populate R85A and R86A with 0 Ω resistors and remove R85 and R86 to disconnect the default clock path outputs and insert the AD9517-4 OUT0 LVPECL. The \nAD9517-4  must be configured through the SPI controller software \nto set up the PLL and other operation modes. Consult the \nAD9517-4 data sheet for more information about these and \nother options.  \nPDWN \nTo enable the power-down feature, add a shorting jumper across \nP7 at Pin 1 and Pin 2 to connect the PDWN pin to DRVDD. \nOEB \nTo disable the outputs using the OEB pin, add a shorting jumper across P3 at Pin 1 and Pin 2 to connect the OEB pin to DRVDD.  \n \nADC10Ω0.1µF 0.1µF\n2V p-pVIN+\nVIN–VCM10pF\n10pF10pF\n10Ω\n10Ω 10Ω0.1µFS\n0.1µF 33Ω33Ω\nS PA P\n08699-003 \nFigure 3. Default Analog Input Configuration of the AD9265/AD9255   \n \n \nUG-074 Evaluation Board User Guide\n \nRev. 0 | Page 6 of 28 Non-SPI Mode \nFor users who want to operate the device under test (DUT) without \nusing SPI, remove the shorting jumpers on P4. This disconnects \nthe CSB, SCLK/DFS, and SDIO/DCS pins from the SPI control \nbus and connects CSB to SVDD, allowing the DUT to operate in non-SPI mode. In this mode, the SCLK/DFS and SDIO/DCS pins take on their alternate functions to select the data format and enable/disable the DCS. With the SDIO/DCS jumper removed, \nDCS is disabled; to enable DCS, add a shorting jumper on P4 \nbetween Pin 2 and Pin 3. With the SCLK/DFS jumper removed, the data format is set to offset binary. To set the data format to twos \ncomplement, a jumper should be added on P4 between Pin 5 \nand Pin 6. \n  Switching Power Supply \nOptionally, the ADC on the board can be configured to use the \nADP21 08 dual switching power supply to provide power to the \nDRVDD and AVDD rails of the ADC. To configure the board to operate from the ADP2108 , the following changes must be \nincorporated (see the Evaluation Board Schematics and Artwork  \nand Bill of Materials  sections for specific recommendations for \npart values):  \n1. Install L2 and L3. \n2. Install C77, C79, C80, and C81. \n3. Install E2, E3, and E11. \n4. Remove P31 and E5.  \nMaking these changes enables the switching converter to power \nthe ADC. Using the switching converter as the ADC power source \nis more efficient than using the default LDOs. \n \nEvaluation Board User Guide UG-074\n \nRev. 0 | Page 7 of 28 EVALUATION BOARD SOFTWARE QUICK START PROCEDURES \nThis section provides quick start procedures for using the AD926 5 \nand AD9255 evaluation board. Both the default and optional \nsettings are described. \nCONFIGURING THE BOARD \nBefore using the software for testing, configure the evaluation \nboard as follows:  \n1. Connect the evaluation board to the data capture board,  \nas shown in Figure 1  and Figure 2 . \n2. Connect one 6 V , 2.5 A switching power supply (such as \nthe CUI, Inc., EPS060250UH-PHP-SZ supplied) to the \nAD9265  or AD92 55 board. \n3. Connect one 6 V , 2.5 A switching power supply (such  as the CUI EPS060250UH-PHP-SZ supplied) to the  HSC-ADC-EV ALCZ board. \n4. Connect the HSC-ADC-EV ALCZ board (at J6) to the PC with a USB cable.  \n5. On the ADC evaluation board, confirm that three jumpers are installed on P4, one between Pin 1 and Pin 2, one between Pin 4 and Pin 5, and one between Pin 8 and Pin 9, to connect the SPI bus to the DUT. \n6. Make sure a low jitter sample clock is applied at J6. \n7. On the ADC evaluation board, use a clean signal generator \nwith low phase noise to provide an input signal. Use a 1 m, \nshielded, RG-58, 50 Ω coaxial cable to connect the signal generator. For best results, use a narrow-band, band-pass \nfilter with 50 Ω terminations and an appropriate center \nfrequency. (Analog Devices uses TTE, Allen Avionics, and K&L Microwave band-pass filters.) \nUSING THE SOFTWARE FOR TESTING \nSetting Up the ADC Data Capture \nAfter configuring the board, set up the ADC data capture using the following steps: \n1. Open VisualAnalog on the connected PC. The appropriate \npart type should be listed in the status bar of the VisualAnalog – New Canvas  window. Select the template \nthat corresponds to the type of testing to be performed  (see Figure 4  where the AD926 5 is shown as an example). \n08699-004 \nFigure 4. VisualAnalog – New Canvas Window \n2.

Typical FFT, AD9265/AD9255 \n \n \n      \n \n \nUG-074 Evaluation Board User Guide\n \nRev. 0 | Page 10 of 28 Troubleshooting Tips \nIf the FFT plot appears abnormal, do the following: \n• If you see a normal noise floor when you disconnect the \nsignal generator from the analog input, be sure you are not \noverdriving the ADC. Reduce the input level, if necessary. \n• In VisualAnalog  (see Figure 7 ), click the Settings  button \nin the Input Formatter  block. Check that Number Format  \nis set to the correct encoding (offset binary by default). \nRepeat for the other channel.  \nIf the FFT appears normal but the performance is poor, check \nthe following: \n• Make sure an appropriate filter is used on the analog input. \n• Make sure the signal generators for the clock and the \nanalog input are clean (low phase noise). \n• Change the analog input frequency slightly if noncoherent \nsampling is being used. \n• Make sure the SPI config file matches the product being \nevaluated. \n If the FFT window remains blank after clicking Run , do the \nfollowing: \n• Make sure the evaluation board is securely connected to \nthe HSC-ADC-EV ALCZ board.  \n• Make sure the FPGA has been programmed by verifying that the DONE  LED is illuminated on the HSC-ADC-\nEV ALCZ board. If this LED is not illuminated, make sure \nthe U4 switch on the board is in the correct position for \nUSB CONFIG. \n• Make sure the correct FPGA program was installed by selecting the Settings  button in the ADC Data Capture \nblock in VisualAnalog  (see Figure 7 ). Then select the \nFPGA  tab and verify that the proper FPGA bin file is \nselected for the part. \nIf VisualAnalog  indicates that the FIFO Capture timed out \n(via a pop-up window), do the following: \n1. Make sure all power and USB connections are secure. \n2. Probe the DCO signal at P25 (Pin 2) on the evaluation \nboard and confirm that a clock signal is present at the \nADC sampling rate.  \n \n \nEvaluation Board User Guide UG-074\n \nRev. 0 | Page 11 of 28 EVALUATION BOARD SCHEMATICS AND ARTWORK 08699-015\n \nFigure 15.
