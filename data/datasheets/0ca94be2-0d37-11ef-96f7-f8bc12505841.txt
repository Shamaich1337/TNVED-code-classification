This rail-to-rail performance combined \nwith excellent accuracy, due to a high CMRR, \nmakes these devices unique among rail-to-rail input \namplifiers. The devices are an excellent choice for \nsystems that require a large input signal range, \nsuch as data acquisition. The LMC648x  are also an \nexcellent upgrade for circuits using limited common-\nmode range amplifiers, such as the TLC272 , TLC274 , \nTLC277  and TLC279 .\nMaximum dynamic signal range is provided in low \nvoltage and single supply systems by the rail-to-rail \noutput swing of the LMC648x . The rail-to-rail output \nswing is maintained for loads down to 600 Ω of the \ndevice. Specified low-voltage characteristics and low-\npower dissipation make the LMC648x  a great choice \nfor battery-operated systems.\nThe LMC648x  devices are available in PDIP, SOIC, \nand VSSOP packages.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER CHANNEL COUNT PACKAGE(1)\nLMC6482 DualD (SOIC, 8)\nDGK (VSSOP, 8)\nP (PDIP, 8)\nLMC6484 QuadD (SOIC, 14)\nN (PDIP, 14)\n(1) For more information, see Section 10.\n \n3V \n0V \nC001 A1      ±0.18 V \n500mV 50\x1ds \nRail-to-Rail Input (V S = 3V)\n1k\x01  RES11A10-Q1\nREF1k\x00+\n–\n1k \x021k \x03OUT LMC648x\nC1C2IN+\nIN−  Unity-Gain Difference AmplifierLMC6482\nLMC6484\nSNOS674I  – OCTOBER 1997 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2024\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

When the input common-mode voltage swings to about 3V from the positive \nrail, some dc specifications, namely offset voltage, can be slightly degraded. Figure 6-1  illustrates this behavior. \nThe LMC648x  incorporate a specially designed input stage to reduce the inherent accuracy problems seen in \nother rail-to-rail input amplifiers. The LMC648x  input stage design is complemented by an output stage capable \nof rail-to-rail output swing even when driving a large load.\nFigure 6-1.

Figure 6-2  shows an input voltage exceeding both supplies with no resulting phase \ninversion on the output.\nThe absolute maximum input voltage is 300mV beyond either supply rail at room temperature. Voltages greatly \nexceeding this absolute maximum rating, as in Figure 6-3 , can cause excessive current to flow in or out of the \ninput pins possibly affecting reliability.\nAn input voltage signal exceeds the LMC6482 power supply \nvoltages with no output phase inversion.\nFigure 6-2.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n7.1 Application Information\n7.1.1 Upgrading Applications\nThe LMC648x  have industry-standard pin outs to retrofit existing applications. System performance can be \ngreatly increased by the features of the LMC648x . The key benefit of designing in the LMC648x  is increased \nlinear signal range. Most op amps have limited input common-mode ranges. Signals that exceed this range \ngenerate a nonlinear output response that persists long after the input signal returns to the common-mode \nrange.\nLinear signal range is vital in applications such as filters where signal peaking can exceed input common-mode \nranges resulting in output phase inversion or severe distortion.\n7.1.2 Data Acquisition Systems\nFigure 7-1  shows a low-power, single-supply data-acquisition system achieved by buffering the ADC12038 with \nthe LMC648x . Capable of using the full supply range, the LMC648x  does not require input signals to be scaled \ndown to meet limited common-mode voltage ranges. The LMC648x  CMRR of 82dB maintains integral linearity \nof a 12-bit data acquisition system to ±0.325 LSB. Other rail-to-rail input amplifiers with only 50dB of CMRR can \ndegrade the accuracy of the data acquisition system to only 8 bits.\n+–\n+\n–12.1 k \x01\n1 k\x00\n500 k\x025 V\n1 nF\n1 k \x03\nLMC648xLMC648x\n2 k\x04\n50 \x05\n200 k\x06\nLM185BX\n130 k\x070.47 μF33 \x0810 μFVA+\nVREF+\nVREF\n\t  \nAGND2.5 V COMADC12038\nVIN\n2.048 V\nNOTE: Operating from the same supply voltage, the LMC648x  buffers the ADC12038 maintaining excellent accuracy.\nFigure 7-1.

Instrumentation circuits designed with the LMC648x  can reject a larger range of \ncommon-mode signals than most in-amps. This makes instrumentation circuits designed with the LMC648x  an \nexcellent choice for noisy or industrial environments. Other applications that benefit from these features include \nanalytic medical instruments, magnetic field detectors, gas detectors, and silicon-based transducers.\nA small valued potentiometer is used in series with R G to set the differential gain of the 3-op-amp \ninstrumentation circuit in Figure 7-2 . This combination is used instead of one large valued potentiometer to \nincrease gain trim accuracy and reduce error due to vibration. An improved design that can help increase \naccuracy, save cost, and reduce board space can be achieved by using the RES11A  matched resistor pair \nseries.\n+\n–LMC648xVIN\x01  \nVOUT0.1%\n50 k\x02\nC1  \n+–\nLMC648x\nVIN+R1RG\n50 k\x0050 k\x03\n0.1%\n50 k\x04+–\nLMC648x50 k\x05\n48.7 k\x06\n10 \x07C2\nC3\n10pF\nVREFC4 = 3-20 pF\n0.1%\n0.1%0.1%Ri = 10 k \x08\nRi 10 k\tac CMR \nadjust\ndc CMR \nadjust\nFigure 7-2. Low Power, Three Op Amp Instrumentation Amplifier\nThe Figure 7-3  shows how a high precision, high CMRR, and low drift in-amp can be achieved using two \nmatched resistor pairs. Using a 1:4 ratio, a gain of 36V/V can be easily implemented. Other gain options are \npossible by using the various ratios available. One downside to the original implementation in Figure 7-2  is \nthat very high performance, 0.01% resistors and a couple of potentiometers are needed to achieve very high \ncommon-mode rejection and gain accuracy. High accuracy resistors can be very expensive and add to board \nlayout size and complexity. Another downside is that the temperature drift of the discrete resistors causes an \nincrease in gain error that is not easily calibrated out.\nThe RES11A  matched resistor pairs provide high common-mode rejection and gain-error performance due to \nexcellent matching to less than 0.05%. The resistors are on the same substrate; therefore, the resistors drift in \nthe same direction, minimizing temperature-related errors such as gain error drift.

Capacitive loads interact with \nthe output impedance of the amplifier to create a pole that can cause instability. When driving capacitive loads, \nconsider the closed-loop bandwidth and output impedance of the amplifier.

The unity \ngain follower is the most sensitive configuration. Direct capacitive loading reduces the phase margin of op amps. \nThe combination of the output impedance of the op-amp and the capacitive load induces phase lag. This results \nin either an underdamped pulse response or oscillation.\nFigure 7-10  shows how improved frequency response is achieved by indirectly driving capacitive loads.\n+–\nLMC648x\nVINVOUTC1 = 100 pF\nR1 = 300 \x01\nCL = 330 pF10 k \x00\nNOTE: Compensated to handle a 330pF capacitive load.\nFigure 7-10. LMC648x  Noninverting Amplifier\nR1 and C1 serve to counteract the loss of phase margin by feeding forward the high-frequency component of the \noutput signal back to the amplifiers inverting input, thereby preserving phase margin in the overall feedback loop. \nThe values of R1 and C1 are experimentally determined for the desired pulse response.

Large feedback resistors can react with small values of input capacitance due \nto transducers, photo diodes, and circuits board parasitics to reduce phase margins.\n+–\nLMC648xVIN\nVOUTCf\nCINR2R1\nFigure 7-12. Canceling the Effect of Input Capacitance\nThe effect of input capacitance can be compensated for by adding a feedback capacitor. The feedback capacitor \n(as in Figure 7-12 ), C f, is first estimated by:\n1\n2 πR 1 C I N\xa0 ≥ \xa01\n2 π R 2 C f(1)\nor\nR1 C IN ≤ R2 C f (2)\nwhich typically provides significant overcompensation.\nPrinted-circuit-board stray capacitance can be larger or smaller than that of a bread-board, so the actual \noptimum value for C f can be different. Check the value of C f on the actual circuit.

To achieve noise immunity as appropriate to the \napplication, use good printed circuit board (PCB) layout practices for power-supply rails and planes, as well as \nbypass capacitors connected between the power-supply pins and ground.\n7.4 Layout\n7.4.1 Layout Guidelines\nAs a general rule, any circuit that must operate with less than 1000pA of leakage current requires special layout \nof the PC board. To take advantage of the ultra-low input current of the LMC648x , typically less than 20fA, an \nexcellent layout is essential. Fortunately, the techniques of obtaining low leakages are quite simple. First, do not \nignore the surface leakage of the PCB even though the leakage current can sometimes appear acceptably low, \nbecause under conditions of high humidity or dust or contamination, the surface leakage can be appreciable.\nTo minimize the effect of any surface leakage, lay out a ring of foil completely surrounding the LMC648x  inputs \nand the terminals of capacitors, diodes, conductors, resistors, relay terminals, and so forth connected to the \ninputs of the op amp, as in Figure 7-26 . To have a significant effect, place guard rings on both the top and \nbottom of the PCB. This PC foil must then be connected to a voltage that is at the same voltage as the amplifier \ninputs, because no leakage current can flow between two points at the same potential. For example, a PCB \ntrace-to-pad resistance of 1012Ω, which is normally considered a very large resistance, can leak 5pA if the trace \nwere a 5V bus adjacent to the pad of the input. This leakage can cause a 250 times degradation from the actual \nperformance of the LMC648x . However, if a guard ring is held within 5mV of the inputs, then even a resistance \nof 1011Ω causes only 0.05pA of leakage current. See Figure 7-27  through Figure 7-29  for typical connections of \nguard rings for standard op-amp configurations.\nBe aware that when laying out a PCB for the sake of just a few circuits is not practical, another technique is even \nbetter than a guard ring on a PCB: Do not insert the input pin of the amplifier into the PCB at all, but bend the \npin up in the air, and use only air as an insulator. Air is an excellent insulator. In this case you forgo some of the \nadvantages of PCB construction, but the advantages are sometimes well worth the effort of using point-to-point \nup-in-the-air wiring. See Figure 7-30 .\n7.4.2 Layout Example\nFigure 7-26.
