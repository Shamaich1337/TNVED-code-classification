Maximum gain bias is nominally Vd=5.0V, \nVg=0V, Id=160mA. Gain can be adjusted by changing Vg. \nIt is recommended to use active biasing to keep the cur-\nrents constant as the RF power and temperature vary; this \ngives the most reproducible results. Depending on the sup-\nply voltage available and the power dissipation constraints, \nthe bias circuit may be a single transistor or a low power \noperational amplifier, with a low value resistor in series with \nthe drain supply used to sense the current. The gate of the \npHEMT is controlled to maintain correct drain current and \nthus drain voltage. The typical gate voltage needed to do \nthis is 0.0V. Typically the gate is protected with Silicon di-\nodes to limit the applied voltage. Also, make sure to sequence the applied voltage to ensure negative gate bias \nis available before applying the positive drain supply.  \n \nApp Note [2] Bias Arrangement - Each DC pad (Vd and Vg) needs to have DC bypass capacitance (~100 -200 \npF) as close to the device as possible. Additional DC bypass capacitance (~0.01 uF) is also recommended.  \nHandling Procedures  \nPlease observe the following precautions to avoid \ndamage:  \n \nStatic Sensitivity  \nGallium Arsenide Integrated Circuits are sensitive \nto electrostatic discharge (ESD) and can be \ndamaged by static electricity.  Proper ESD control \ntechniques should be used when handling these \nclass 2 devices.  \n\nDistributed Amplifier  \n18-50 GHz   \nRev.  V1  \nXD1001 -BD \n9 9 \nM/A-COM Technology Solutions Inc.
