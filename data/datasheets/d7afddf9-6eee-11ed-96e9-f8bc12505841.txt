The high period (T\nH) of the PWM remains static over all temperatures, \nwhile the low period (T L) varies. The B Grade version offers a \nhigh temperature accuracy of ±1°C from 0°C to 70°C with excellent transducer linearity. The digital output of the TMP05/ TMP06 is CMOS-/TTL-compatible and is easily interfaced to the serial inputs of most popular microprocessors. The flexible \nopen-drain output of the TMP06 is capable of sinking 5 mA. \nThe TMP05/TMP06 are specified for operation at supply voltages \nfrom 3 V to 5.5 V . Operating at 3.3 V , the supply current is typically \n370 μA. The TMP05/TMP06 are rated for operation over the –40°C \nto +150°C temperature range. It is not recommended to operate \nthese devices at temperatures above 125°C for more than a total of 5% (5,000 hours) of the lifetime of the devices. They are \npackaged in low cost, low area SC-70 and SOT-23 packages. \nThe TMP05/TMP06 have three modes of operation: continu-\nously converting mode, daisy-chain mode, and one shot mode. \nA three-state FUNC input determines the mode in which the \nTMP05/TMP06 operate. The CONV/IN input pin is used to determine the rate at which \nthe TMP05/TMP06 measure temperature in continuously \nconverting mode and one shot mode. In daisy-chain mode, the \nCONV/IN pin operates as the input to the daisy chain. \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. The TMP05/TMP06 have an on-chip temperature sensor \nthat allows an accurate measurement of the ambient \ntemperature. The measurable temperature range is  \n–40°C to +150°C. \n2. Supply voltage is 3 V to 5.5 V . \n3. Space-saving 5-lead SOT-23 and SC-70 packages. \n4. Temperature accuracy is typically ±0.5°C. Each part needs \na decoupling capacitor to achieve this accuracy. \n5. Temperature resolution of 0.025°C. \n6. The TMP05/TMP06 feature a one shot mode that reduces \nthe average power consumption to 102 μW at 1 SPS. \n \n \nTMP05/TMP06 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 13 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION  \nThe TMP05/TMP06 are monolithic temperature sensors that \ngenerate a modulated serial digital output that varies in direct \npropor tion with the temperature of each  device. An on -board \nsensor generates a v oltage precisely proportional to absolute \ntemperature, which is compared to an internal voltage reference \nand is input to a precision digital modulator. The ratiometric encoding format of the serial digital output is independent of the clock drift errors c ommon to most serial modulation \ntechniques such as voltage -to-frequency converters. Overall \naccuracy for the A g rade is ±2°C from 0°C to +70°C with \nexcellent transducer linearity. B grade accuracy is ±1°C from \n0°C to 70°C. The digital output of the TMP05 i s CMOS -/TTL - \ncompatible  and is easily interfaced to the serial inputs of most \npopular microprocessors. The open -drain output of the TMP06 \nis capable of sinking 5 mA.  \nThe on -board temperature sensor has excellent accuracy and \nlinearity over the entire rated temperature range without \ncorrection or calibration by the user.  \nThe sensor output is digitized by a first -order Σ-∆ modulator, \nalso known as the charge balance type analog -to-digital \nconverter. This type of converter utilizes time -domain over -\nsampling an d a high accuracy comparator to deliver 12 bits of \neffective accuracy in an extremely compact circuit.  \nCONVERTER DETAILS  \nThe Σ-∆ modulator consists of an input sampler, a summing \nnetwork, an integrator, a comparator, and a 1 -bit DAC. Similar \nto the voltag e-to-frequency converter, this architecture creates, \nin effect, a negative feedback loop whose intent is to minimize the integrator output by changing the duty cycle of the compara tor output in response to input voltage changes. The \ncomparator samples the output of the integrator at a much higher rate than the input sampling frequency, which is called oversampling. Oversampling spreads the quantization noise over a much wider band than that of the input signal, improving overall noise performance and increa sing accuracy.  \nΣ-ΔMODUL ATOR\nINTEGR ATOR\nCOM PARATOR\n1-BIT\nDAC\nDIGITAL\nFILTERCLOCK\nGENERAT ORVOLT AGE REF\nAND VP TAT\nTMP05/TMP06\nOUT\n(SINGLE-BIT)+\n–+\n–\n03340-006 \nFigure 20. First -Order Σ-∆ Modulator  The modulated output of the comparator is encoded using a circuit technique that results in a serial digital signal with a mark -space ratio format. This format is easily decoded  by any \nmicroprocessor into either °C or °F values, and is readily transmitted or modulated over a single wire. More importantly, this encoding method neatly avoids major error sources common  to other modulation techniques  because it is clock -\nindependent.  \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON  \nThe output of the TMP05/TMP06 is a square wave with a \ntypical period of 99 ms at 25°C (CONV/IN pin is left floating). \nThe high period, TH, is constant, while the low period, TL, varies \nwith measured temperature. The output format fo r the nominal \nconversion rate is readily decoded by the user as follows:  \nTemperature (°C) = 421 − (751 × ( TH/TL)) (1) \n \nTH TL\n03340-007 \nFigure 21. TMP05/TMP06 Output Format  \nThe time periods TH (high period) and TL (low period) are \nvalues easily r ead by a microprocessor timer/counter port, with \nthe above calculations performed in software. Because both periods are obtained consecutively using the same clock, performing the division indicated in Equation 1 results in a \nratiometric value  independent of the exact frequency or drift of \nthe TMP05/TMP06 originating clock or the user’s counting clock.  \nOPERATING MODES  \nThe user can program the TMP05/TMP06 to operate in three different modes by configuring the FUNC pin on power -up as \neither low, floating, or high.  \nTable 6. Operating Modes  \nFUNC Pin  Operating Mode  \nLow  One shot  \nFloating  Continuously converting  \nHigh  Daisy -chain  \nContinuously Converting Mode  \nIn continuously converting mode, the TMP05/TMP06 continu -\nously output a squa re wave representing temperature. The \nfrequency at which this square wave is output is determined by the state of the CONV/IN pin on power -up. Any change to the \nstate of the CONV/IN pin after power -up is not reflected in the \nparts until the TMP05/TMP06 are  powered down and back up.  \n \nTMP05/TMP06 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 14 of 28 One Shot Mode  \nIn one shot mode, the TMP05/TMP06 output one square wave \nrepresenting temperature when requested by the microcon -\ntroller. The microcontroller pulls the OUT pin low and then releases it to indicate to the TMP05/TMP06 that an output is \nrequired. The time between the OUT pin going low to the time \nit is released should be greater than 20 ns. Internal hysteresis in the OUT pin  prevent s the TMP05/TMP06 from recogniz ing \nthat the pulse is going low (if it is less than 20 ns) . The \ntemperature measurement is output when the OUT line is released by the microcontroller (see Figure 22). \nµCONTROLLER RELEASES\nOUT LINE HEREµCONTROLLER PULLS DOWN\nOUT LINE HERE\nTEMP MEASUREMENT\nTLTH\n>20ns\nTIME T0\n03340-019 \nFigure 22. TMP05/TMP06 One Shot OUT Pin Signal  \nIn the TMP05 one shot mode only, an internal  resistor is \nswitched in series with the pull -up MOSFET. The TMP05 OUT \npin has a push -pull output configuration (see Figure 23). \nTherefore, it needs a series resistor to limit the current drawn \non this pin when the user pulls it low to start a temperature conversion. This series resistance prevents any short circuit from V\nDD to GND, and , as a result,  protects the TMP05 from \nshort -circuit damage.  \nTMP05V+\nOUT5kΩ\n03340-016 \nFigure 23. TMP05 One Shot Mode OUT Pin Configuration  \nThe ad vantages of the one shot mode include lower average \npower consumptio n, and the microcontroller knowing  that the \nfirst low -to-high transition occurs after the microcontroller \nreleases the OUT pin.  \n \n \n  Conversion Rate  \nIn continuously converting and one shot modes, the state of the \nCONV/IN pin on power -up determines the rate at which the \nTMP05/TMP06 measure temperature. The available conversion rates are shown in Table 7. \nTable 7.

However, the trade -off is loss of resolution on the \nlow time. Depending on the state of the CONV/IN pin, two different temperature equations must be used.  \nThe temperature equation for the low and floating states’  \nconver sion rates is  \nTemperature (°C) = 421 − (751 × ( T\nH/TL)) (2) \nTable 8.

In this mode, the CONV/IN pin operates as the input of the daisy chain. In addition, conversions take place at \nthe nominal conversion rate of T\nH/TL = 34 ms/65 ms at 25°C. \nTherefore, the temperature equation for the daisy-chain mode \nof operation is  \nTemperature  (°C) = 421 − (751 × ( TH∕TL)) (4) \nOUT\nMICRO\nINTMP05/\nTMP06CONV/IN\nOUT#1\nTMP05/\nTMP06CONV/IN\nOUT#2\nTMP05/\nTMP06CONV/IN\nOUT#3\nTMP05/\nTMP06CONV/IN\nOUT#N\n03340-009 \nFigure 24. Daisy-Chain Structure A second microcontroller line is needed to generate the conver-\nsion start pulse on the CONV/IN pin. The pulse width of the \nstart pulse should be less than 25 μs but greater than 20 ns. The start pulse on the CONV/IN pin lets the first TMP05/TMP06 \npart know that it should now start a conversion and output its \nown temperature. Once the part has output its own temperature, it outputs a start pulse for the next part on the daisy-chain link. The pulse width of the start pulse from each TMP05/TMP06 part \nis typically 17 μs.  \nFigure 25 shows the start pulse on the CONV/IN pin of the first \ndevice on the daisy chain. Figure 26 shows the PWM output by \nthis first part. \nBefore the start pulse reaches a TMP05/TMP06 part in the \ndaisy chain, the device acts as a buffer for the previous tempera-\nture measurement signals. Each part monitors the PWM signal for the start pulse from the previous part. Once the part detects the start pulse, it initiates a conversion and inserts the result at \nthe end of the daisy-chain PWM signal. It then inserts a start \npulse for the next part in the link. The final signal input to the microcontroller should look like Figure 27. The input signal on Pin 2 (IN) of the first daisy-chain device must remain low until \nthe last device has output its start pulse. \nIf the input on Pin 2 (IN) goes high and remains high, the \nTMP05/TMP06 part powers down between 0.3 sec and 1.2 sec \nlater. The part, therefore, requires another start pulse to generate \nanother temperature measurement. Note that to reduce power \ndissipation through the part, it is recommended to keep Pin 2 (IN) at a high state when the part is not converting. If the IN pin is at 0 V , the OUT pin is at 0 V (because it is acting as a buffer when not converting), and is drawing current through either the \npull-up MOSFET (TMP05) or the pull-up resistor (TMP06).  \nMUST GO HIGH ONLY\nAFTER START PULSE HAS\nBEEN OUTPUT BY LASTTMP05/TMP06 ON DAISY CHAIN.\nSTARTPULSE\nCONVERSIONSTARTS ONTHIS EDGE>20ns\nAND<25µs\nTIME\nT0>20ns\n03340-017 \nFigure 25.

C | Page 17 of 28 APPLICATION HINTS  \nTHERMAL RESPONSE TIM E  \nThe time required for a temperature sensor to settle to a \nspecified accuracy is a function of th e sensor’s thermal mass \nand the thermal conductivity between the sensor and the object being sensed. Thermal mass is often considered equivalent to capacitance. Thermal conductivity is commonly specified using the symbol Q and can be thought of as thermal resistance. It is usually  specified in units of degrees per watt of power transferred  \nacross the thermal joint. Thus, the time required for the TMP05/  \nTMP06 to settle to the desired accuracy is dependent on the package selected, the thermal contact establi shed in that \nparticular application, and the equivalent power of the heat source. In most applications, the settling time is probably best \ndetermined empirically.  \nSELF -HEATING EFFECTS  \nThe temperature measurement a ccuracy of the TMP05/TMP06 \ncan be degrade d in some applications due to self -heating. Errors \nare introduced from the quiescent dissipation and power dissipated  \nwhen converting, that is, during TL. The magnitude of these \ntemperature errors depends on the thermal conduc tivity of the \nTMP05/TMP06 pack age, the mounting technique, and the \neffects of airflow. S tatic dissipation in the TMP05/TMP06 is \ntypically 10 µW operating at 3.3 V with no load. In the 5- lead \nSC-70 package mounted in free air, this accounts for a \ntemperature increase due to self -heating  of \nΔT = PDISS × θJA = 10 µW × 534.7°C/W = 0.0053°C   (5) \nIn addition, power is dissipated by the digital output, which is capable of sinking 800 µA continuously (TMP05). Under an \n800 µA load, the output can dissipate  \nP\nDISS = (0.4 V)(0.8 mA)((TL)/TH + TL)) (6) \nFor example, with TL = 80 ms and TH = 40 ms, the power \ndissipation due to the digital output is approximately 0.21 mW . In a free -standing SC -70 package, this accounts for a tempera -\nture increase due to self -heating of  \nΔT = P\nDISS × θJA = 0.21 mW × 534.7°C/W = 0.112°C  (7) \nThis temperature increase directly adds to that from the \nquiescent dissipation and affects the accuracy of the TMP05/ TMP06 relative to the true ambient temperature.  \nIt is recommended that current dissipated through the device be \nkept to  a minimum  because it has a proportional effect on the \ntemperature error.  SUPPLY DECOUPLING  \nThe TMP05/TMP06 should be decoupled with a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor between V\nDD and GND. This is particularly important \nif the TMP05/TMP06 are mounted remotely from the power supply. Precision analog products such as the TMP05/TMP06 \nrequire a well f iltered power source. Because the parts  operate \nfrom a single supply, simply tapping into the digital logic power supply  could appear to be a convenient option. Unfortuna tely, \nthe logic supply is often a switch -mode design, which generates \nnoise in the 20 kHz to 1 MHz range. In addition, fast logic gates can generate glitches hundreds of mV in amplitude due to wiring resistance and inductance. \nIf possible, the TMP05/TMP06 should be powered directly \nfrom the system power supply. This arrangement, shown in \nFigure 30, isolates the analog section from the logic switching \ntransients. Even if a separate power sup ply trace is not available , \ngenerous supp ly bypassing reduces supply -line-induced errors. \nLocal supply bypassing consisting of a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor is critical for the temperature accuracy specifications to be achieved. This decoupling capacitor must be  placed as close as \npossible to the TM P05/TMP06 V\nDD pin. A  recommended \ndecoupling capacitor is Phicomp’s 100 nF, 50 V X74.  \nIt is important to k eep the capacitor pa ckage size as small as \npossible because ESL (equivalent series inductance) increases \nwith increasing package size. Reducing the ca pacitive value \nbelow 100 nF increases the ESR (equivalent series resistance). Using a  capacitor with an ESL of 1 nH and an ESR of 80 mΩ is \nrecommended.  \n0.1µFTMP05/\nTMP06TTL/CMOS\nLOGIC\nCIRCUITS\nPOWER\nSUPPLY\n03340-013 \nFigure 30.

C | Page 18 of 28 LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS \nDigital boards can be electrically noisy environments and \nglitches are com mon on many of the signals in the system.  \nThe likelihood of glitches causing problems to the TMP05/  \nTMP06 OUT pin is very minute. The typical impedance of the TMP05/TMP06 OUT pin when driving low is 55  Ω. When \ndriving high, the TMP05 OUT pin  is similar. T his low imped -\nance makes it very difficult for a glitch to break  the V\nIL and VIH \nthresholds. There is a slight risk that a sizeable glitch could \ncause problems. A glitch can only cause problems when the OUT pin is low during a temperature measurement. If a  glitch \noccurs that is large enough to fool the master into believing that the temperature measurement is over , the temperature read \nwould not be the actual temperature. In most cases, the master  \nspots a temperature value that is erroneous and can  request \nanother temperature measurement for confirmati on. One area \nthat can  cause problems is if  this very large glitch occurs  near \nthe end of the low period of the mark -space waveform , and th e \ntemperature read back is  so close to the expectant temperature \nthat th e master does  not question it.  \nOne layout method that help s in reducing the possibility of a \nglitch is to run ground tracks on either side of the OUT line. Use a wide OUT track to minimize inductance and reduce noise pickup. A 10 mil track minimum width a nd spacing is \nrecommended. Figure 31 shows how glitch protection traces \ncould be laid  out. \nGND\nOUT\nGND10 MI L\n10 MI L\n10 MI L10 MI L\n10 MI L\n03340-043 \nFigure 31. Use Separate Traces to Reduce Power Supply Noise  \nAnother method that help s reduce the possibility o f a glitch is to \nuse a 50 ns glitch filter on the OUT line. The glitch filter eliminate s any possibility of a glitch getting through to the \nmaster or being passed along a daisy chain.  \nTEMPERATURE MONITORI NG \nThe TMP05/TMP06 are ideal for monitoring the ther mal \nenvironment within electronic equipment. For example, the surface -mounted package accurately reflects the exact thermal \nconditions that affect nearby integrated circuits.  \nThe TMP05/TMP06 measure and convert the temperature at the surface of their own s emiconductor chip. When the \nTMP05/ TMP06 are used to measure the temperature of a nearby heat source, the thermal impedance between the heat source and the TMP05/TMP06 must be considered. Often, a thermocouple or other temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature of the source, while the TMP05/TMP06 temperature is monitored by measuring T\nH and TL. Once  the \nthermal impedance is determined, the temperature of the heat source can be inferred from the TMP05/TMP06 output.  \nOne example of using the TMP05/T MP06’s unique properties is \nin monitoring a high power  dissipation microprocessor. Each  \nTMP05/TMP06 part, in a surface -mounted package, is \nmounted directly beneath the microprocessor’s pin grid array (PGA) package. In a typical application, the TMP05/TMP06  \noutput is connected to an ASIC, where the pulse width is measured. The TMP05/TMP06 pulse output provides a significan t advantage in this application  because it produces a \nlinear temperature output while needing only one I/O pin and without requiring an AD C. \nDAISY -CHAIN APPLICATION  \nThis section provides an example of how to connect two TMP05s in daisy -chain mode to a standard 8052 microcon -\ntroller core. The ADuC812 is the microcontrolle r used and the \ncore processing engine is the 8052 . Figure 31 shows how to \ninterface to the 8052 core device. The TMP05 Program Code Example 1  section shows how to communi cate from the \nADuC812 to two daisy -chained TMP05s. This code can also be \nused with the ADuC831 or any microprocessor running on an 8052 core.  \nTIMER T0\nSTARTS TEMPSEGMENT = 1 TEMPSEGMENT = 2 TEMPSEGMENT = 3\nTEMP_HIGH2 TEMP_HIGH1\nTEMP_LOW0 TEMP_LOW1TEMP_HIGH0\nINTO INTO INTO\n03340-035 \nFigure 32.
