Low initial error and temperature drift combined with\nlow output noise and the ability to drive any value of capacitance\nmake the AD780  the ideal choice for enhancing the performance\nof high resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-\nanalog converters (DACs), and for any general-purpose precision\nreference application. A unique low headroom design facilitates a\n3.0 V output from a 5.0 V 10% input, providing a 20% boost to\nthe dynamic range of an ADC over performance with existing 2.5 V\nreferences.\nThe AD780  can be used to source or sink up to 10 mA, and\ncan be used in series or shunt mode, thus allowing positive or\nnegative output voltages without external components. This makes\nit suitable for virtually any high performance reference application.\nUnlike some competing references, the AD780  has no region of\npossible instability. The part is stable under all load conditions when\na 1 µF bypass capacitor is used on the supply.\nA temperature output pin on the AD780  provides an output voltage\nthat varies linearly with temperature, allowing the part to be config-\nured as a temperature transducer while providing a stable 2.5 V or\n3.0 V output.\nThe AD780  is a pin compatible performance upgrade for the\nLT1019(A)–2.5 and the AD680 . The latter is targeted toward low\npower applications.\nThe AD780  is available in three grades in PDIP and SOIC\npackages. The AD780AN, AD780AR, AD780BN, AD780BR, and\nAD780CR are specified for operation from −40°C to +85°C.PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1.The AD780  provides a pin programmable 2.5 V or 3.0 V output\nfrom a 4 V to 36 V input.\n2.Laser trimming of both initial accuracy and temperature coeffi-\ncients results in low errors over temperature without the use of\nexternal components. The AD780BN has a maximum variation\nof 0.9 mV from −40°C to +85°C.\n3.For applications that require even higher accuracy, an optional\nfine-trim connection is provided.\n4.The AD780  noise is extremely low, typically 4 mV p-p from 0.1\nHz to 10 Hz and a wideband spectral noise density of typically\n100 nV/ √Hz. This can be further reduced, if desired, by using\ntwo external capacitors.\n5.The temperature output pin enables the AD780  to be configured\nas a temperature transducer while providing a stable output\nreference.\nData Sheet AD780\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

J | 5 of 12Band gap references are the high performance solution for low\nsupply voltage and low power voltage reference applications. In\nthis technique, a voltage with a positive temperature coefficient\nis combined with the negative coefficient of a transistor’s Vbe to\nproduce a constant band gap voltage.\nIn the AD780 , the band gap cell contains two NPN transistors\n(Q6 and Q7) that differ in emitter area by 12×. The difference in\ntheir Vbes produces a PTAT current in R5. This, in turn, produces\na PTAT voltage across R4 that, when combined with the Vbe of\nQ7, produces a voltage (Vbg) that does not vary with temperature.\nPrecision laser trimming of the resistors and other patented circuit\ntechniques are used to further enhance the drift performance.\nFigure 4. Schematic DiagramThe output voltage of the AD780  is determined by the configuration\nof Resistors R13, R14, and R15 in the amplifier’s feedback loop.\nThis sets the output to either 2.5 V or 3.0 V, depending on whether\nR15 (Pin 8) is grounded or not connected.\nA unique feature of the AD780  is the low headroom design of the\nhigh gain amplifier, which produces a precision 3 V output from an\ninput voltage as low as 4.5 V (or 2.5 V from a 4.0 V input). The\namplifier design also allows the part to work with +VIN = VOUT when\ncurrent is forced into the output terminal. This allows the AD780  to\nwork as a 2-terminal shunt regulator, providing a −2.5 V or −3.0 V\nreference voltage output without external components.\nThe PTAT voltage is also used to provide the user with a thermome-\nter output voltage (at Pin 3) that increases at a rate of approximate-\nly 2 mV/°C.\nThe DNC (Pin 7) of the AD780  is a 20 k Ω resistor to +VIN that is\nused solely for production test purposes. Users who are currently\nusing the LT1019 self-heater pin (Pin 7) must take into account the\ndifferent load on the heater supply.\nData Sheet AD780\nAPPLYING THE AD780\nanalog.com Rev. J | 6 of 12The AD780  can be used without any external components to\nachieve specified performance. If power is supplied to Pin 2 and Pin\n4 is grounded, Pin 6 provides a 2.5 V or 3.0 V output depending on\nwhether Pin 8 is left unconnected or grounded.\nA bypass capacitor of 1 µF (+VIN to GND) should be used if the\nload capacitance in the application is expected to be greater than 1\nnF. The AD780  in 2.5 V mode typically draws 700 µA of Iq at 5 V.\nThis increases by ~2 µA/V up to 36 V.\nFigure 5. Optional Fine-Trim Circuit\nInitial error can be nulled using a single 25 k Ω potentiometer\nconnected between VOUT, TRIM, and GND. This is a coarse trim\nwith an adjustment range of 4%, and is only included here for\ncompatibility purposes with other references. A fine trim can be\nimplemented by inserting a large value resistor (e.g., 1 M Ω to 5\nMΩ) in series with the wiper of the potentiometer (see Figure 5 ).\nThe trim range, expressed as a fraction of the output, is simply\ngreater than or equal to 2.1 k Ω/RNULL for either the 2.5 V or 3.0 V\nmode.\nThe external null resistor affects the overall temperature coefficient\nby a factor equal to the percentage of VOUT nulled.\nFor example, a 1 mV (0.03%) shift in the output caused by the trim\ncircuit, with a 100 ppm/°C null resistor, adds less than 0.06 ppm/°C\nto the output drift (0.03% × 200 ppm/°C, since the resistors internal\nto the AD780  also have temperature coefficients of less than 100\nppm/°C).\nNOISE PERFORMANCE\nThe impressive noise performance of the AD780  can be further\nimproved, if desired, by adding two capacitors: a load capacitor\n(C1) between the output and ground, and a compensation capacitor\n(C2) between the TEMP pin and ground. Suitable values are shown\nin Figure 6 .Figure 6. Compensation and Load Capacitor Combinations\nC1 and C2 also improve the settling performance of the AD780\nwhen subjected to load transients. The improvement in noise per-\nformance is shown in Figure 7 , Figure 8 , Figure 9 , and Figure 10 .\nFigure 7. Standalone Noise Performance\nFigure 8. Standalone Noise Performance\nData Sheet AD780\nAPPLYING THE AD780\nanalog.com Rev. J | 7 of 12Figure 9. Noise Reduction Circuit\nNOISE COMPARISON\nThe wideband noise performance of the AD780  can also be ex-\npressed in ppm. The typical performance with C1 and C2 is 0.6\nppm; without external capacitors, typical performance is 1.2 ppm.\nThis performance is, respectively, 7× and 3× lower than the speci-\nfied performance of the LT1019 .\nFigure 10. Reduced Noise Performance with C1 = 100 µF, C2 = 100 nF\nTEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE\nThe AD780  provides superior performance over temperature by\nmeans of a combination of patented circuit design techniques, pre-\ncision thin-film resistors, and drift trimming. Temperature perform-\nance is specified in terms of ppm/°C; because of nonlinearity in the\ntemperature characteristic, the box test method is used to test and\nspecify the part. The nonlinearity takes the form of the characteristic\nS-shaped curve shown in Figure 11 . The box test method forms\na rectangular box around this curve, enclosing the maximum and\nminimum output voltages over the specified temperature range. The\nspecified drift is equal to the slope of the diagonal of this box.Figure 11. Typical AD780BN Temperature Drift\nTEMPERATURE OUTPUT PIN\nThe AD780  provides a TEMP output (Pin 3) that varies linearly with\ntemperature. This output can be used to monitor changes in system\nambient temperature, and to initiate calibration of the system, if\ndesired. The voltage VTEMP is 560 mV at 25°C, and the temperature\ncoefficient is approximately 2 mV/°C.\nFigure 12  shows the typical VTEMP characteristic curve over temper-\nature taken at the output of the op amp with a noninverting gain of\n5.\nFigure 12. Temperature Pin Transfer Characteristic\nSince the TEMP voltage is acquired from the band gap core circuit,\ncurrent pulled from this pin has a significant effect on VOUT. Care\nmust be taken to buffer the TEMP output with a suitable op amp,\nfor example, an OP07 , AD820 , or AD711  (all of which would result\nin less than a 100 µV change in VOUT). The relationship between\nITEMP and VOUT is\n∆VOUT = 5.8 mV/µA ITEMP (2.5 V Range)\nor\n∆VOUT = 6.9 mV/µA ITEMP (3.0 V Range)\nData Sheet AD780\nAPPLYING THE AD780\nanalog.com Rev. J | 8 of 12Notice how sensitive the current dependent factor on VOUT is. A\nlarge amount of current, even in tens of microamps, drawn from the\nTEMP pin can cause the VOUT and TEMP output to fail.\nThe choice of C1 and C2 was dictated primarily by the need for\na relatively flat response that rolled off early in the high frequency\nnoise at the output. However, there is considerable margin in the\nchoice of these capacitors. For example, the user can actually put\na huge C2 on the TEMP pin with none on the output pin. However,\none must either put very little or a lot of capacitance at the TEMP\npin. Intermediate values of capacitance can sometimes cause oscil-\nlation. In any case, the user should follow the recommendation in\nFigure 6 .\nTEMPERATURE TRANSDUCER CIRCUIT\nThe circuit shown in Figure 13  is a temperature transducer that\namplifies the TEMP output voltage by a gain of a little over +5 to\nprovide a wider full-scale output range. The digital potentiometer\ncan be used to adjust the output so it varies by exactly 10 mV/°C.\nTo minimize resistance changes with temperature, resistors with\nlow temperature coefficients, such as metal film resistors, should be\nused.\nFigure 13. Differential Temperature Transducer\nSUPPLY CURRENT OVER TEMPERATURE\nThe quiescent current of the AD780  varies slightly over temperature\nand input supply range. The test limit is 1 mA over the industrial\nand 1.3 mA over the military temperature range. Typical perform-\nance with input voltage and temperature variation is shown in\nFigure 14 .Figure 14. Typical Supply Current over Temperature\nTURN-ON TIME\nThe time required for the output voltage to reach its final value\nwithin a specified error band is defined as the turn-on settling time.\nThe two major factors that affect this are the active circuit settling\ntime and the time for the thermal gradients on the chip to stabilize.\nTypical settling performance is shown in Figure 15 . The AD780\nsettles to within 0.1% of its final value within 10 µs.\nFigure 15. Turn-On Settling Time Performance\nDYNAMIC PERFORMANCE\nThe output stage of the AD780  has been designed to provide\nsuperior static and dynamic load regulation.\nFigure 16  and Figure 17  show the performance of the AD780  while\ndriving a 0 mA to 10 mA load.\nData Sheet AD780\nAPPLYING THE AD780\nanalog.com Rev.

For example,\nthe load may be connected via a long capacitive cable. Figure 18\nand Figure 19  show the performance of the AD780  driving a 1000\npF, 0 mA to 10 mA load.\nFigure 18. Capacitive Load Transient Response Test CircuitFigure 19. Settling under Dynamic Capacitive Load\nLINE REGULATION\nLine regulation is a measure of change in output voltage due\nto a specified change in input voltage. It is intended to simulate\nworst-case unregulated supply conditions and is measured in µV/V.\nFigure 20  shows typical performance with 4.0 V < VIN < 15.0 V.\nFigure 20. Output Voltage Change vs. Input Voltage\nPRECISION REFERENCE FOR HIGH\nRESOLUTION 5 V DATA CONVERTERS\nThe AD780  is ideally suited to be the reference for most 5 V\nhigh resolution ADCs. The AD780  is stable under any capacitive\nload, has superior dynamic load performance, and its 3.0 V output\nprovides the converter with the maximum dynamic range without\nrequiring an additional and expensive buffer amplifier. One of the\nmany ADCs that the AD780  is suited for is the AD7884 , a 16-bit,\nhigh speed sampling ADC (see Figure 21 ). This part previously\nneeded a precision 5 V reference, resistor divider, and buffer\namplifier to do this function.\nData Sheet AD780\nAPPLYING THE AD780\nanalog.com Rev. J | 10 of 12Figure 21. Precision 3 V Reference for the AD7884 16-Bit, High Speed ADC\nThe AD780  is also ideal for use with higher resolution converters,\nsuch as the AD7710 /AD7711 /AD7712  (see Figure 22 ). While these\nparts are specified with a 2.5 V internal reference, the AD780  in 3\nV mode can be used to improve the absolute accuracy, temperature\nstability, and dynamic range. It is shown in Figure 22  with the two\noptional noise reduction capacitors.\nFigure 22.

The AD780  can be used to provide a precision\n4.5 V reference voltage from a 5 V supply using the circuit shown\nin Figure 23 . This circuit provides a regulated 4.5 V output from a\nsupply voltage as low as 4.7 V. The high quality tantalum 10 µF\ncapacitor, in parallel with the ceramic AD780  0.1 µF capacitor and\nthe 3.9 Ω resistor, ensures a low output impedance around 50 MHz.Figure 23. 4.5 V Reference from a Single 5 V Supply\nNEGATIVE (–2.5 V) REFERENCE\nThe AD780  can produce a negative output voltage in shunt mode\nby connecting the input and output to ground, and connecting the\nGND pin of the AD780  to a negative supply via a bias resistor, as\nshown in Figure 25 .\nFigure 24.
