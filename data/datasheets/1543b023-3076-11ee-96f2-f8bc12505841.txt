For optimum linearity \nperformance, it is recommended to bias this device at V D = 4 V with I D = 90 mA. It is also recommended to use      \nactive biasing to control the drain currents because this gives the most reproducible results over temperature or \nRF level variations. Depending on the supply voltage available and the power dissipation constraints, the bias \ncircuit may be a single transistor or a low power operational amplifier, with a low value resistor in series with the \ndrain supply used to sense the current. The gate of the pHEMT is controlled to maintain correct drain current and \nthus drain voltage. The typical gate voltage needed to do this is -0.5 V. Typically the gate is protected with silicon \ndiodes to limit the applied voltage. Also, make sure to sequence the applied voltage to ensure negative gate bias \nis available before applying the positive drain supply.  \nLead -Free Package Dimensions/Layout† \n† Reference Application Note S2083 for lead -free solder reflow recommendations.  \n   Meets JEDEC moisture sensitivity level 1 requirements.  \nBuffer Amplifier  \n10 - 21 GHz   \nRev.
