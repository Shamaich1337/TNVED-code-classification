Application information\nThe PESD2CAN is designed for the protection of two automotive CAN bus lines from the \ndamage caused by ESD and surge pulses. The PESD2CAN can be used for both, \nhigh-speed CAN bus and fault-tolerant CA N bus protection. The PESD2CAN provides a \nsurge capability of up to 230 W per line for an 8/20 \uf06ds waveform.\n \nCircuit board layout and pr otection device placement:\nCircuit board layout is critic al for the suppression of ESD, Electrical Fast Transient (EFT) \nand surge transients. The following guidelines are recommended:\n1. Place the PESD2CAN as close to the inpu t terminal or connector as possible.\n2. Minimize the path length betwee n the PESD2CAN and the protected line.\n3. Keep parallel signal paths to a minimum.\n4. Avoid running protection conductors in parallel with unprotected conductors.5. Minimize all Printed-Circuit Board (PCB ) conductive loops including power and \nground loops.\n6. Minimize the length of the transient return path to ground.7. Avoid using shared transient return paths to a common ground point.8. Use ground planes whenever possible. For multilayer PCBs, use ground vias.\n8.
