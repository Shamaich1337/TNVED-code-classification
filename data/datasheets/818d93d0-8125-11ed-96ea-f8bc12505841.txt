The PoE implementation\nsupports the IEEE 802.3at standard as a 13-W, type 1\nPD. The requirements for an IEEE 802.3at type 1\ndevice are a superset of IEEE 802.3-2008 (originally\nIEEE 802.3af).The TPS23753A supports a number of input-voltage\nORing options including highest voltage, external\nadapter preference, and PoE preference.\nThe PoE interface features an external detection\nsignature pin that can also be used to disable the\ninternal hotswap MOSFET. This allows the PoE\nfunction to be turned off. Classification can be\nprogrammed to any of the defined types with a single\nresistor.\nThe DC-DC controller features a bootstrap start-up\nmechanism with an internal, switched current source.\nThis provides the advantages of cycling overload fault\nprotection without the constant power loss of a pullup\nresistor.\nThe programmable oscillator may be synchronized to\na higher-frequency external timing reference. The\nTPS23753A features improvements for uninterrupted\ndevice operation through an ESD event.\nDevice Information (1)\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS23753A TSSOP (14) 5.00 mm × 4.40 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the data sheet.\nTPS23753M1\nRCSCOUTDVC\nGATERTNVC\nCS\nCVCCTLVBD1\n58VC1\n0.1/c109F\nRDENRCLSFrom Ethernet\nTransformers\nVDD1\nVSSCLSCIN\nVOUT\nRCTL CCTLFrom Spare\nPairs or\nTransformersDSDEN\nBLNKFRS DA\nRFRSVB\nCVBAdapterRFBU\nRFBLTLV431ROB\nCIZAPDRAPD2RAPD1\nRBLNKVDD\nCIOT1BR1\nBR2RVC\n* Adapter interface and RBLNKare Optional**\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nBasic TPS23753A Implementationwww.ti.comTPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753ATPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

TI recommends using a resistor divider. The divider provides ESD protection, leakage discharge for the\nadapter ORing diode, and input voltage qualification. Voltage qualification assures the adapter can support the\nPD before the PoE current is cut off.\nSelect the APD divider resistors per Equation 1  and Equation 2 , where V ADPTR-ON  is the desired adapter voltage\nthat enables the APD function as adapter voltage rises.\n/c40 /c411 2 _/c61 /c45APD APD ADPTR ON APDEN APDENR R V V V x\n(1)\n/c40 /c411 2\n_\n2/c43/c61 /c45APD APD\nADPTR OFF APDEN APDH\nAPDR RV V V\nRx\n(2)\nThe CLS output is disabled when a voltage above V APDEN  is applied to the APD pin.\nPlace the APD pulldown resistor adjacent to the APD pin.\nAPD must be tied to RTN when not used.\n8.3.1.2 BLNK\nBlanking provides an interval between the gate drive going high and the current comparator on CS actively\nmonitoring the input. This delay allows the normal turnon current transient (spike) to subside before the\ncomparator is active, preventing undesired short duty cycles and premature current limiting.\nConnect BLNK to RTN to obtain the internally set blanking period.

The TPS23753A supports class 0 – 3 power levels.\n8.3.1.4 CS\nThe current-sense input for the DC-DC converter should be connected to the high side of the current-sense\nresistor of the switching MOSFET. The current-limit threshold, V CSMAX , defines the voltage on CS above which\nthe GATE ON-time are terminated regardless of the voltage on CTL.\nThe TPS23753A provides internal slope compensation to stabilize the current mode control loop.

VB is regulated\ndown from V C, and is the bias voltage for the rest of the converter control. A start-up current source from V DD1 to\nVC is controlled by a comparator with hysteresis to implement a bootstrap start-up of the converter. V C must be\nconnected to a bias source, such as a converter auxiliary output, during normal operation.\nA minimum 0.22- μF capacitor, located adjacent to the V C pin, must be connected from V C to RTN to bypass the\ngate driver. A larger total capacitance is required for start-up.\n8.3.1.12 V DD\nPositive input power rail for PoE control that is derived from the PoE.

The IEEE 802.3at standard is an update to IEEE 802.3-2008\nclause 33 (PoE), adding high-power options and enhanced classification.\nGenerally speaking, a device compliant to IEEE 802.3-2008 is referred to as a type 1 device, and devices with\nhigh power or enhanced classification is referred to as type 2 devices. The TPS23753A is intended to power\ntype 1 devices (up to 13 W), and is fully compliant to IEEE 802.3at for hardware classes 0 - 3. Standards change\nand must always be referenced when making design decisions.\nThe IEEE 802.3at standard defines a method of safely powering a PD (powered device) over a cable, and then\nremoving power if a PD is disconnected. The process proceeds through an idle state and three operational\nstates of detection, classification, and operation. The PSE leaves the cable unpowered (idle state) while it\nperiodically looks to see if something has been plugged in; this is referred to as detection. The low power levels\nused during detection are unlikely to damage devices not designed for PoE. If a valid PD signature is present,\nthe PSE may inquire how much power the PD requires; this is referred to as (hardware) classification. Only Type\n2 PSEs are required to do hardware classification. The PD may return the default 13-W current-encoded class,\nor one of four other choices. The PSE may then power the PD if it has adequate capacity. Once started, the PD\nmust present the maintain power signature (MPS) to assure the PSE that it is still present. The PSE monitors its\noutput for a valid MPS, and turns the port off if it loses the MPS. Loss of the MPS returns the PSE to the idle\nstate. Figure 8-1  shows the operational states as a function of PD input voltage.\nNormal Operation\n57 42 36 30 20.5 14.5 10.1 2.7\nDetectionLower Limit DetectionUpper LimitClassification\nLowerLimit\nClassificationUpper Limit Must Turn Off by -Voltage Falling\nLower Limit -Proper OperationMustTurnOnby-\nVoltageRising\nMaximum Input\nVoltage\nDetect ClassifyShut-\ndown\nPI Voltage (V)0\n3/06/08\nFigure 8-1. IEEE 802.3-2005 (Type 1) Operational States\nThe PD input is typically an RJ-45 eight-lead connector which is referred to as the power interface (PI). PD input\nrequirements differ from PSE output requirements to account for voltage drops in the cable and operating\nmargin. The IEEE 802.3at standard uses a cable resistance of 20 Ω for type 1 devices to derive the voltage\nlimits at the PD based on the PSE output voltage requirements. Although the standard specifies an output power\nof 15.4 W at the PSE, only 13 W is available at the PI due to the worst-case power loss in the cable. The PSE\ncan apply voltage either between the RX and TX pairs (pins 1–2 and 3–6 for 10baseT or 100baseT), or between\nthe two spare pairs (4–5 and 7–8). The PSE may only apply voltage to one set of pairs at a time. The PD uses\ninput diode bridges to accept power from any of the possible PSE configurations. The voltage drops associated\nwith the input bridges create a difference between the standard limits at the PI and the TPS23753A\nspecifications.\nThe PSE is permitted to disconnect a PD if it draws more than its maximum class power over a one second\ninterval. A Type 1 PSE compliant to IEEE 802.3at is required to limit current to between 400 mA and 450 mA\nduring powered operation, and it must disconnect the PD if it draws this current for more than 75 ms. Class 0\nand 3 PDs may draw up to 400-mA peak currents for up to 50 ms. The PSE may set lower output current limits\nbased on the declared power requirements of the PD.TPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753A\n8.4.1 Threshold Voltages\nThe TPS23753A has a number of internal comparators with hysteresis for stable switching between the various\nstates as shown in Figure 8-1 . Figure 8-2  relates the parameters in Electrical Characteristics: Controller Section\nOnly and Electrical Characterisics: PoE and Control  to the PoE states. The mode labeled idle between\nclassification and operation implies that the DEN, CLS, and RTN pins are all high impedance.\nVUVLO_RDetectionClassificationPD Powered\nIdle\nVCL_ONVCL_HYS\n1.4VVCU_OFFVCU_HYS\nNote: Variable names refer to Electrical Characteristic\nTable parametersVVDD-VSS\nVUVLO_HOperational State\nFigure 8-2.

The key\nwaveforms shown are V VDD-VSS , VRTN-VSS , and I PI. IEEE 802.3at requires a minimum of two detection levels;\nhowever, four levels are shown in this example. Four levels guard against misdetection of a device when\nplugged in during the detection sequence.\nFigure 8-3. PoE Start-Up Sequence\n8.4.3 Detection\nThe TPS23753A is in detection mode whenever V VDD-V  SS is below the lower classification threshold. When the\ninput voltage rises above V CL_ON , the DEN pin goes to an open-drain condition to conserve power. While in\ndetection, RTN is high impedance, almost all the internal circuits are disabled, and the DEN pin is pulled to V SS.www.ti.comTPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753A\nAn R DEN of 24.9 kΩ (1%), presents the correct signature. It may be a small, low-power resistor because it only\nsees a stress of about 5 mW. A valid PD detection signature is an incremental resistance between 23.75 k Ω and\n26.25 kΩ at the PI.\nThe detection resistance seen by the PSE at the PI is the result of the input bridge resistance in series with the\nparallel combination of R DEN and the TPS23753A bias loading. The incremental resistance of the input diode\nbridge may be hundreds of ohms at the very low currents drawn when 2.7 V is applied to the PI. The input bridge\nresistance is partially cancelled by the effective resistance of the TPS23753A during detection.\n8.4.4 Hardware Classification\nHardware classification allows a PSE to determine the power requirements of a PD before starting, and helps\nwith power management once power is applied. The maximum power entries in Table 8-1  determine the class\nthe PD must advertise. A Type 1 PD may not advertise Class 4. The PSE may disconnect a PD if it draws more\nthan its stated Class power. The standard permits the PD to draw limited current peaks; however, the average\npower requirement always applies.\nVoltage from 14.5 V to 20.5 V is applied to the PD for up to 75 ms during hardware classification. A fixed output\nvoltage is sourced by the CLS pin, causing a fixed current to be drawn from V DD through R CLS. The total current\ndrawn from the PSE during classification is the sum of bias and R CLS currents. PD current is measured and\ndecoded by the PSE to determine which of the five available classes is advertised (see Table 8-1 ). The\nTPS23753A disables classification above V CU_OFF  to avoid excessive power dissipation. CLS voltage is turned\noff during PD thermal limit or when APD or DEN are active. The CLS output is inherently current-limited, but\nshould not be shorted to V SS for long periods of time.\nTable 8-1.

A valid MPS consists of a minimum DC current of 10 mA (at a duty cycle of at least 75 ms on\nevery 225 ms) and an AC impedance lower than 26.25 k Ω in parallel with 0.05 μF. The AC impedance is usually\naccomplished by the minimum C IN requirement of 5 μ F. When APD or DEN are used to force the hotswap switch\noff, the DC MPS is not met. A PSE that monitors the DC MPS will remove power from the PD when this occurs.\nA PSE that monitors only the AC MPS may remove power from the PD.\n8.4.6 TPS23753A Operation\n8.4.6.1 Start-Up and Converter Operation\nThe internal PoE undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit holds the hotswap switch off before the PSE provides full\nvoltage to the PD. This prevents the converter circuits from loading the PoE input during detection and\nclassification. The converter circuits discharges C IN, CVC, and C VB while the PD is unpowered. Thus V RTN-VDD\nwill be a small voltage just after full voltage is applied to the PD, as seen in Figure 8-3 .\nThe PSE drives the PI voltage to the operating range once it has decided to power up the PD. When V DD rises\nabove the UVLO turnon threshold (V UVLO-R , approximately 35 V) with RTN high, the TPS23753A enables the\nhotswap MOSFET with an approximately 140-mA (inrush) current limit. See the waveforms of Figure 8-4  for an\nexample. Converter switching is disabled while C IN charges and V RTN falls from V DD to nearly V SS; however, the\nconverter start-up circuit is allowed to charge C VC. Once the inrush current falls about 10% below the inrushTPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753A\ncurrent limit, the PD control switches to the operational level (approximately 450 mA) and converter switching is\npermitted.\nConverter switching is allowed if the PD is not in inrush and the V C UVLO circuit permits it. Continuing the start-\nup sequence shown in Figure 8-4 , VVC rises as the start-up current source charges C VC and M1 switching is\ninhibited by the status of the V C UVLO. The V B regulator powers the internal converter circuits as V VC rises.\nStart-up current is turned off, converter switching is enabled, and a soft-start cycle starts when V VC exceeds\nUVLO 1 (approximately 9 V). V VC falls as it powers both the internal circuits and the switching MOSFET gate. If\nthe converter control-bias output rises to support V VC before it falls to UVLO 1 – UVLO 1H (approximately 5.5 V), a\nsuccessful start-up occurs. Figure 8-4  shows a small droop in V VC while the output voltage rises smoothly and a\nsuccessful start-up occurs.\n01234567810\nt - Time 10 - ms/DIV-0.7-0.6-0.5IPI\nVDD-RTNVC-RTNINRUSH\nTurn ON VOUT\n50V/DIV2V/DIV10V/DIV100mA/DivExaggerated primary-\nsecondary softstart handoff\nFigure 8-4. Power Up and Start\nIf VVDD-VSS  drops below the lower PoE UVLO (UVLO R – UVLO H, approximately 30.5 V), the hotswap MOSFET\nis turned off, but the converter still runs. The converter stops if V VC falls below the converter UVLO (UVLO 1 –\nUVLO H, approximately 5.5 V), the hotswap is in inrush current limit, or 0% duty cycle is demanded by V CTL (VCTL\n< VZDC, approximately 1.5 V), or the converter is in thermal shutdown.\n8.4.6.2 PD Self-Protection\nThe PD section has the following self-protection functions.\n• Hotswap switch current limit\n• Hotswap switch foldback\n• Hotswap thermal protection\nThe internal hotswap MOSFET is protected against output faults with a current limit and deglitched foldback. The\nPSE output cannot be relied on to protect the PD MOSFET against transient conditions, requiring the PD to\nprovide fault protection. High stress conditions include converter output shorts, shorts from V DD1 to RTN, or\ntransients on the input line. An overload on the pass MOSFET engages the current limit, with V RTN-VSS  rising as\na result. If V RTN rises above approximately 12 V for longer than approximately 400 μs, the current limit reverts to\nthe inrush limit, and turns the converter off. The 400- μs deglitch feature prevents momentary transients from\ncausing a PD reset, provided that recovery lies within the bounds of the hotswap and PSE protection. Figure 8-5\nshows an example of recovery from a 15-V PSE rising voltage step. The hotswap MOSFET goes into current\nlimit, overshooting to a relatively low current, recovers to 420-mA, full-current limit, and charges the input\ncapacitor while the converter continues to run. The MOSFET did not go into foldback because V RTN-VSS  was\nbelow 12 V after the 400-μs deglitch.www.ti.comTPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753A\nFigure 8-5. Response to PSE Step Voltage\nThe PD control has a thermal sensor that protects the internal hotswap MOSFET. Conditions like start-up or\noperation into a V DD to RTN short cause high power dissipation in the MOSFET. An overtemperature shutdown\n(OTSD) turns off the hotswap MOSFET and class regulator, which are restarted after the device cools. The PD\nrestarts in inrush current limit when exiting from a PD overtemperature event.\nPulling DEN to V SS during powered operation causes the internal hotswap MOSFET to turn off. This feature\nallows a PD with secondary-side adapter ORing to achieve adapter priority. Take care with synchronous\nconverter topologies that can deliver power in both directions.\nThe hotswap switch is forced off under the following conditions:\n• V APD above V APDEN  (approximately 1.5 V)\n• V DE N ≤ V PD_DIS  when V VDD-VSS  is in the operational range\n• PD over temperature\n• V VDD-VSS  < PoE UVLO (approximately 30.5 V)\n8.4.6.3 Converter Controller Features\nThe TPS23753A DC-DC controller implements a typical current-mode control as shown in Figure 8-6 . Features\ninclude oscillator, overcurrent and PWM comparators, current-sense blanker, soft start, and gate driver. In\naddition, an internal current-compensation ramp generator, frequency synchronization logic, thermal shutdown,\nand start-up current source with control are provided.\nThe TPS23753A is optimized for isolated converters, and does not provide an internal error amplifier. Instead,\nthe optocoupler feedback is directly fed to the CTL pin which serves as a current-demand control for the PWM\nand converter. There is an offset of V ZDC (approximately 1.5 V) and 2:1 resistor divider between the CTL pin and\nthe PWM. A V CTL below V ZDC stops converter switching, while voltages above (V ZDC + 2 × V CSMAX ) does not\nincrease the requested peak current in the switching MOSFET. Optocoupler biasing design is eased by this\nlimited control range.\nThe internal start-up current source and control logic implement a bootstrap-type start-up. The start-up current\nsource charges C VC from V DD1 when the converter is disabled (either by the PD control or the V C control), while\noperational power must come from a converter (bias winding) output. Loading on V C and V B must be minimal\nwhile C VC charges, otherwise the converter may never start. The optocoupler does not load V B when the\nconverter is off. The converter shuts off when V C falls below its lower UVLO. This can happen when power is\nremoved from the PD, or during a fault on a converter output rail. When one output is shorted, all the output\nvoltages fall including the one that powers V C. The control circuit discharges V C until it hits the lower UVLO and\nturns off. A restart initiates as described in Start-Up and Converter Operation  if the converter turns off and thereTPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753A\nis sufficient V DD1 voltage. This type of operation is sometimes referred to as hiccup mode , which provides robust\noutput short protection by providing time-average heating reduction of the output rectifier.\nTake care in the design of the transformer and V C bias circuit to obtain hiccup overload protection. Leading-edge\nvoltage overshoot on the bias winding may cause V C to peak-charge, preventing the expected tracking with\noutput voltage. R VC (Figure 9-1 ) is often required slow the peak charging. Good transformer bias-to-output-\nwinding coupling results in reduced overshoot and better voltage tracking.\nThe start-up current source transitions to a resistance as (V DD1 – V C) falls below 7 V, but starts the converter\nfrom 12-V adapters within t ST (VDD1 ≥ 10.2, t ST approximately 85 ms). The converter starts from lower voltages,\nlimited by the case when charge current equals the device bias current at voltage below the upper V C UVLO.\nThe bootstrap source provides reliable start-up from widely varying input voltages, and eliminates the continual\npower loss of external resistors. The start-up current source does not charge above the maximum recommended\nVVC if the converter is disabled and there is sufficient V DD1 to charge higher.\nThe peak current limit does not have duty cycle dependency unless R S is used as shown in Figure 8-8  to\nincrease slope compensation. This makes it easier to design the current limit to a fixed value.\nThe TPS23753A blanker timing is precise enough that the traditional R-C filters on CS can be eliminated. This\navoids current-sense waveform distortion, which tends to get worse at light output loads. While the internally set\nblanking period is relatively precise, almost all converters require their own blanking period. The TPS23753A\nprovides the BLNK pin to allow this programming. There may be some situations or designers that prefer an R-C\napproach. The TPS23753A provides a pulldown on CS during the GATE OFF-time to improve sensing when an\nR-C filter must be used. The CS input signal must be protected from nearby noisy signals like GATE drive and\nthe MOSFET drain.\nConverters require a soft start on the voltage error amplifier to prevent output overshoot on start-up. Figure 8-6\nshows a common implementation of a secondary-side soft start that works with the typical TL431 error amplifier\nshown in Figure 9-1 . This secondary-side error amplifier does not become active until there is sufficient voltage\non the secondary. The TPS23753A provides a primary-side soft start, which persists long enough (approximately\n800 μs) for secondary side voltage-loop soft start to take over; however, the actual start-up is typically shorter\nthan this. The primary-side current-loop soft-start controls the switching MOSFET peak current by applying a\nslowly rising ramp voltage to a second PWM control input. The lower of the CTL and soft-start ramps controls the\nPWM comparator. Figure 8-4  shows an exaggerated handoff between the primary and secondary-side soft start\nthat is most easily seen in the I PI waveform. The output voltage rises in a smooth monotonic fashion with no\novershoot. The soft-start handoff in this example could have been optimized by decreasing the secondary-side\nsoft-start period.\nRFBU\nRFBL\nTLV 431ROB\nCIZRSS\nCSSDSSFrom Regulated\nOutput Voltage\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-6.

The controller OTSD turns off V B, the GATE driver, resets the\nsoft-start generator, and forces the V C control into an undervoltage state.\n8.4.7 Special Switching MOSFET Considerations\nTake special care in selecting the converter switching MOSFET. The TPS23753A converter section has\nminimum V C operating voltage of approximately 5.5 V, which is reflected in the applied gate voltage. This occurs\nduring an output overload, or towards the end of a (failed) bootstrap start-up. The MOSFET must be able to\ncarry the anticipated peak fault current at this gate voltage.\n8.4.8 Thermal Considerations\nSources of nearby local PCB heating must be considered during the thermal design. Typical calculations assume\nthat the TPS23753A is the only heat source contributing to the PCB temperature rise. It is possible for a normally\noperating TPS23753A device to experience an OTSD event if it is excessively heated by a nearby device.\n8.4.9 FRS and Synchronization\nThe FRS pin programs the (free-running) oscillator frequency, and may also be used to synchronize the\nTPS23753A converter to a higher frequency. The internal oscillator sets the maximum duty cycle and controls\nthe current-compensation ramp circuit, making the ramp height independent of frequency. R FRS must be\nselected per Equation 5 .\n15000( )\n( )FRS\nSWR k\nf kHzΩ =\n(5)\nThe TPS23753A may be synchronized to an external clock to eliminate beat frequencies from a sampled\nsystem, or to place emission spectrum away from an RF input frequency. Synchronization may be accomplished\nby applying a short pulse ( > 25 ns) of magnitude V SYNC to FRS as shown in Figure 8-7 . RFRS must be chosen\nso that the maximum free-running frequency is just below the desired synchronization frequency. The\nsynchronization pulse terminates the potential ON-time period, and the OFF-time period does not begin until the\npulse terminates. A short pulse is preferred to avoid reducing the potential ON-time.\nFigure 8-7  shows examples of nonisolated and transformer-coupled synchronization circuits RT reduces noise\nsusceptibility for the isolation transformer implementation. The FRS node must be protected from noise because\nit is high impedance.\nFRSRFRS47pFSynchronization\nPulse\nVSYNCTSYNC\n1:11000pF\nRTRTNFRSRFRS47pFSynchronization\nPulse\nVSYNCTSYNC\nRTN\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-7. Synchronization\n8.4.10 Blanking – R BLNK\nThe TPS23753A BLNK feature permits programming of the blanking period with specified tolerance. Selection of\nthe blanking period is often empirical because it is affected by parasitics and thermal effects of every device\nbetween the gate-driver and output capacitors.\nThere is a critical range of blanking period that is bounded on the short side by erratic operation, and on the long\nside by potentially harmful switching-MOSFET and output rectifier currents during a short circuit. The minimum\nblanking period prevents the current limit and PWM comparators from being falsely triggered by the inherent\ncurrent spike  that occurs when the switching MOSFET turns on. The maximum blanking period is bounded by\nthe ability of the output rectifier to withstand the currents experienced during a converter output short.TPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753A\nThe TPS23753A provides a choice between internal fixed and programmable blanking periods. The blanking\nperiod is specified as an increase in the minimum GATE on time over the inherent gate driver and comparator\ndelays. The default period (see Electrical Characteristics: Controller Section Only  and Electrical Characterisics:\nPoE and Control ) is selected by connecting BLNK to RTN, and the programmable period is set with a resistor\nfrom BLNK to RTN using Equation 6 .\n() ()BLNK BLNKR k t ns Ω =\n(6)\nFor example, a 100-ns period is programmed by a 100-k Ω resistor. For a brand-new design, TI recommends\ndesigning an initial blanking period of 125 ns. This period must be turned when the converter is operational.\n8.4.11 Current Slope Compensation\nCurrent-mode control requires addition of a compensation ramp to the sensed inductor (flyback transformer)\ncurrent for stability at duty cycles near and over 50%. The TPS23753A has a maximum duty cycle limit of 78%,\npermitting the design of wide input-range flyback converters with a lower voltage stress on the output rectifiers.\nWhile the maximum duty cycle is 78%, converters may be designed that run at duty cycles well below this for a\nnarrower, 36-V to 57-V range. The TPS23753A provides a fixed internal compensation ramp that suffices for\nmost applications. R S (see Figure 8-8 ) may be used if the internally provided slope compensation is not enough.\nIt works with ramp current (I PK = ISL-EX , approximately 40 μA) that flows out of the CS pin when the MOSFET is\non. The I PK specification does not include the approximately 3-μA fixed current that flows out of the CS pin.\nMost current-mode control papers and application notes define the slope values in terms of V PP/TS (peak ramp\nvoltage / switching period); however, Electrical Characteristics: Controller Section Only  specifies the slope peak\n(VSLOPE ) based on the maximum duty cycle. Assuming that the desired slope, V SLOPE-D  (in mV/period), is based\non the full period, compute R S per Equation 7  where V SLOPE , D MAX, and I SL-EX  are from Electrical\nCharacteristics: Controller Section Only  with voltages in mV, current in μA, and the duty cycle is unitless (for\nexample, D MAX = 0.78).\n_\n_( )( )\n( ) 1000( )SLOPE\nSLOPE D\nMAX\nS\nSL EXV mVV mVD\nRI A µ\uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8eb \uf8f6−\uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8f0 \uf8fbΩ = ⋅\n(7)\nRCSGATE\nCS\nRTN RS\nCS5/09/08\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-8. Additional Slope Compensation\nCS may be required if the presence of R S causes increased noise, due to adjacent signals like the gate drive, to\nappear at the C S pin. The TPS23753A has an internal pulldown on C S ( approximately 400 Ω maximum) while\nthe MOSFET is OFF to reduce cycle-to-cycle carry-over voltage on C S.\n8.4.12 Adapter ORing\nMany PoE-capable devices are designed to operate from either a wall adapter or PoE power. A local power\nsolution adds cost and complexity, but allows a product to be used if PoE is not available in a particular\ninstallation. While most applications only require that the PD operate when both sources are present, thewww.ti.comTPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753A\nTPS23753A supports forced operation from either of the power sources. Figure 8-9  illustrates three options for\ndiode ORing external power into a PD. Only one option would be used in any particular design. Option 1 applies\npower to the TPS23753A PoE input, option 2 applies power between the TPS23753A PoE section and the\npower circuit, and option 3 applies power to the output side of the converter. Each of these options has\nadvantages and disadvantages. A detailed discussion of the TPS23753A and ORing solutions is covered in\napplication note Advanced Adapter ORing Solutions using the TPS23753 , (SLVA306 ).\nTPS2375358V\n0.1uFRDEN\nRCLSFrom EthernetTransformersVDD\nVSSCLSDENLow Voltage\nOutput\nRTNFrom SparePairs or\nTransformersPower\nCircuit\nAdapter\nOption 3Adapter\nOption 2Adapter\nOption 1VDD1Optional for PoE Priority\n5/8/08\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-9. ORing Configurations\nPreference of one power source presents a number of challenges. Combinations of adapter output voltage\n(nominal and tolerance), power insertion point, and which source is preferred determine solution complexity.\nSeveral factors contributing to the complexity are the natural high-voltage selection of diode ORing (the simplest\nmethod of combining sources), the current limit implicit in the PSE, PD inrush, and protection circuits (necessary\nfor operation and reliability). Creating simple and seamless solutions is difficult if not impossible for many of the\ncombinations. However, the TPS23753A offers several built-in features that simplify some combinations.\nSeveral examples demonstrate the limitations inherent in ORing solutions. Diode ORing a 48-V adapter with PoE\n(option 1) presents the problem that either source might be higher. A blocking switch would be required to assure\nwhich source was active. A second example is combining a 12-V adapter with PoE using option 2. The converter\ndraws approximately four times the current at 12 V from the adapter than it does from PoE at 48 V. Transition\nfrom adapter power to PoE may demand more current than can be supplied by the PSE. The converter must be\nturned off while C IN capacitance charges, with a subsequent converter restart at the higher voltage and lower\ninput current. A third example is use of a 12-V adapter with ORing option 1. The PD hotswap would have to\nhandle four times the current, and have 1/16 the resistance (be 16 times larger) to dissipate equal power. A\nfourth example is that MPS is lost when running from the adapter, causing the PSE to remove power from the\nPD. If adapter power is then lost, the PD stops operating until the PSE detects and powers the PD.\nThe most popular preferential ORing scheme is option 2 with adapter priority. The hotswap MOSFET is disabled\nwhen the adapter is used to pull APD high, blocking the PoE source from powering the output. This solution\nworks well with a wide range of adapter voltages, is simple, and requires few external parts. When the AC power\nfails, or the adapter is removed, the hotswap switch is enabled. In the simplest implementation, the PD\nmomentarily loses power until the PSE completes its start-up cycle.\nThe DEN pin can be used to disable the PoE input when ORing with option 3. This is an adapter priority\nimplementation. Pulling DEN low, while creating an invalid detection signature, disables the hotswap MOSFET,\nand prevents the PD from redetecting. This would typically be accomplished with an optocoupler that is driven\nfrom the secondary side of the converter.\nThe least popular technique is PoE priority. It is implemented by placing a diode between the PD supply voltage,\nVDD, and the DC-DC controller bias voltage, V DD1. The diode prevents reverse biasing of the PoE input diode\nbridges when option 2 adapter ORing is used. The PSE may then detect, classify, and provide power to the PDTPS23753A\nSLVS933D – JULY 2009 – REVISED DECEMBER 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS23753A\nwhile a live adapter is connected. As long as the PoE voltage is greater than the adapter voltage, the PSE\npowers the load. The APD function is not used in this technique.\nThe IEEE standards require that the PI conductors be electrically isolated from ground and all other system\npotentials not part of the PI interface. The adapter must meet a minimum 1500-Vac dielectric withstand test\nbetween the output and all other connections for options 1 and 2. The adapter only needs this isolation for option\n3 if it is not provided by the converter.\nAdapter ORing diodes are shown for all the options to protect against a reverse-voltage adapter, a short on the\nadapter input pins, and damage to a low-voltage adapter. ORing is sometimes accomplished with a MOSFET in\noption 3.\n8.4.13 Protection\nA TVS across the rectified PoE voltage per Figure 9-1  must be used. For general indoor applications, TI\nrecommends an SMAJ58A or a part with equal to or better performance. If an adapter is connected from V DD1 to\nRTN, as in ORing option 2 above, voltage transients caused by the input cable inductance ringing with the\ninternal PD capacitance can occur. Adequate capacitive filtering or a TVS must limit this voltage to be within the\nAbsolute Maximum Ratings . Configurations that use D VDD as in Figure 8-10  may require additional protection\nagainst ESD transients that would turn D VDD off and force all the voltage to appear across the internal hotswap\nMOSFET. C VDD and D RTN per Figure 8-10  provide this additional protection.\nC10.1/c109F\nRDEN RCLSFrom Ethernet\nTransformers\nVDD\nVSSCLSFrom Spare\nPairs or\nTransformersDENDVDD\nVDD1RTN\nCIND158VDRTN\n58VCVDD\n0.01 /c109F\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-10. Additional Protection Against ESD\nOutdoor applications require more extensive protection to lightning standards.\n8.4.14 Frequency Dithering for Conducted Emissions Control\nThe international standard CISPR 22 (and adopted versions) is often used as a requirement for conducted\nemissions. Ethernet cables are covered as a telecommunication port under section 5.2 for conducted emissions.\nMeeting EMI requirements is often a challenge, with the lower limits of Class B being especially hard. Circuit\nboard layout, filtering, and snubbing various nodes in the power circuit are the first layer of control techniques. A\nmore detailed discussion of EMI control is presented in Practical Guidelines to Designing an EMI Compliant PoE\nPowered Device With Isolated Flyback , SLUA469 . Additionally, IEEE 802.3at sections 33.3 and 33.4 have\nrequirements for noise injected onto the Ethernet cable based on compatibility with data transmission.\nOccasionally, a technique referred to as frequency dithering is used to provide additional EMI measurement\nreduction.
