The device is offered in\n48-ball Fine-pitch BGA (0.8 mm pitch), and 48-pin TSOP packages . The word-wide data (x16) appears on DQ15–DQ0; the byte-\nwide (x8) data appears on DQ7–DQ0. This device is designed to b e programmed in-system with th e standard system 3.0 volt VCC\nsupply. A 12.0 V VPP or 5.0 VCC are not required for write or erase operations. The device can  also be programmed in standard\nEPROM programmers.\nThe device offers access times o f up to 55 ns allowing high spe ed microprocessors to operate without wait states. To eliminate  bus\ncontention the device has separat e chip enable (CE#), write ena ble (WE#) and output enable (OE#) controls.\nThe device requires only a single 3.0 volt power supply  for both read and write functions. Internally generated and re gulated\nvoltages are provided for the program and erase operations. \nThe S29AL008J is entirely command set compatible with the JEDEC single-power-supply Flash standard . Commands are written\nto the command register using stand ard microprocessor write tim ings. Register contents serve as  input to an internal state-mac hine\nthat controls the erase and progr amming circuitry. Write cycles  also internally latch addresses and data needed for the progra mming\nand erase operations. Reading da ta out of the device is similar  to reading from other F lash or EPROM devices.\nDevice programming occurs by executing the program command sequ ence. This initiates the Embedded Program  algorithm—an\ninternal algorithm that automatically times the program pulse w idths and verifies proper cell margin. The Unlock Bypass  mode\nfacilitates faster pr ogramming times by requiring only two writ e cycles to program dat a instead of four.\nDevice erasure occurs by executing the erase command sequence. This initiates the Embedded Erase  algorithm—an internal\nalgorithm that automatically pre programs the array (if it is no t already programmed) before exec uting the erase operation. Dur ing\nerase, the device autom atically times the erase pulse widths an d verifies proper cell margin. \nThe host system can detect whether a progra m or erase operation  is complete by observing the R Y/BY# pin, or by reading the DQ7\n(Data# Polling) a nd DQ6 (toggle) status bits . After a program or erase cycle has been completed, the device  is ready to read array\ndata or accept another command. \nThe sector erase architecture  allows memory sectors to be er ased and reprog rammed without af fecting the data contents of other\nsectors. The device i s fully erased when s hipped from the facto ry.\nHardware data protection  measures include a low VCC detector that automatically inhibits write operations during p ower\ntransitions. The hardware sector protection  feature disables both program and erase operations in any comb ination of the sectors\nof memory. This can be achieved in-system or via programming eq uipment.\nThe Erase Suspend/Erase Resume feature enables the user to put erase on hold for any period of  time to read data from, or\nprogram data to, any se ctor that is not sel ected for erasure. T rue background erase can thus be achieved.\nThe hardware RESET# pin  terminates any operation in progress and resets the internal s tate machine to reading array data. The\nRESET# pin may be tied to the syst em reset circuitry. A system reset would thus also reset the device, enabling the system\nmicroprocessor to read the boot -up firmware from the Flash memo ry.\nThe device offers two power-sav ing features. When addresses hav e been stable for a specified amount of time, the device enters\nthe automatic sleep mode . The system can also place the device into the standby mode . Power consumption is greatly reduced in\nboth these modes.\nCypress Flash technology combine s years of Flash memory manufac turing experience to produce the highest levels of quality,\nreliability and cost effectiveness. The device electrically era ses all bits within a sector simultaneously via Fowler-Nordheim\ntunneling. The data is programm ed using hot electron injection.\nDocument Number: 002-00778 Rev. *Q Page 3 of 50S29AL008J\nContents\nDistinctive Characteristics ..................................................  1\nGeneral Description .............................................................  2\n1.

Device Bus Operations\nThis section describes the requir ements and use of the device b us operations, which are initiated through the internal command\nregister. The command register itself does not occupy any addre ssable memory location. The register is composed of latches tha t\nstore the commands, along with the address and data information  needed to execute the command. The contents of the register\nserve as inputs to the internal state machine. The state machin e outputs dictate the function of the device. The following tab le lists\nthe device bus operations, the inputs and control levels they r equire, and the resulting output. The following subsections des cribe\neach of these operatio ns in further detail.\nLegend\nL = Logic Low = VIL; H = Logic High = VIH; VID = 8.5 V to 12.5 V; X = Don’t Care; AIN = Address In; DOUT = Data Out\nNotes\n1. Address In = Amax:A0 in WORD mode (BYTE#=VIH), Address In = Amax:A-1 in BYTE mode (BYTE#=VIL). Sector addresses are Amax to A12 in both WORD mode \nand BYTE mode.\n2. The sector group protect and sector group unprotect func tions may also be implemented via programming equipment. See Sector Group Protection/Unprotection \non page 14.  \n3. If WP# = VIL, the outermost sector remains protected (determined by device configuration). If WP# = VIH, the outermost sector protection depends on whether the \nsector was last protected or unprotected using the method described in Section 7.10, Sector Group Protection/Unprotection on page 14 . The WP# contains an internal \npull-up; when unconnected, WP is at VIH.\n4. DIN or DOUT as required by command sequence, data polling, or sector group protection algorithm.Table 1.

If the BYTE# pin i s\nset at logic 1, the device is in word configur ation, DQ15–DQ0 are active and controlled by CE# and OE#.\nIf the BYTE# pin is set at logic 0, the device is in byt e configuration, and only data I/O pins D Q0–DQ7 are active and controlled by\nCE# and OE#. The data I/O pins D Q8–DQ14 are tristated, and the DQ15 pin is used as an input for the LSB (A-1) address function . \n7.2 Requirements for  Reading Array Data\nTo read array data from the outputs, the system must drive the CE# and OE# pins to VIL. CE# is the power control and selects the\ndevice. OE# is the output control and gates array data to the o utput pins. WE# should remain at VIH. The BYTE# pin determines\nwhether the device ou tputs array data i n words or bytes.\nThe internal state machine is set for reading array data upon d evice power-up, or after a hardware reset. This ensures that no\nspurious alteration of the memo ry content occurs during the pow er transition. No command is necessary in this mode to obtain a rray\ndata. Standard microprocessor read cycles that assert valid add resses on the device address inputs produce valid data on the\ndevice data outputs. The devic e remains enabled for read access  until the command regist er contents are altered.\nSee Reading Array Data on page 22  for more information. Refer to the AC Read Operations on page 36  for timing specifications and\nto Figure 14 on page 36  for the timing diagram. ICC1 in DC Characteristics on page 34  represents the active cu rrent specification for\nreading array data.\n7.3 Writing Commands/Command Sequences\nTo write a command or command sequence (which includes programm ing data to the device and erasing sectors of memory), the\nsystem must drive W E# and CE# to VIL, and OE# to VIH.\nFor program operations, the BYTE# pin determines whether the de vice accepts program data in bytes or words. See Word/Byte\nConfiguration on page 10  for more information. \nThe device features an Unlock Bypass  mode to facilitate faster progra mming. Once t he device enters the Unlock Bypass mode,\nonly two write cycles are require d to program a word or byte, i nstead of four. Word/Byte Program Command Sequence on page 23\nhas details on programming data  to the device using both standa rd and Unlock Bypass command sequences.\nAn erase operation can erase one sector, multiple sectors, or t he entire device. T a b l e2  o np a g e1 1  and Table 4 on page 12  indicate\nthe address space that each sect or occupies. A “sector address”  consists of the address bits requi red to uniquely select a sec tor.\nThe Command Definitions on page 22  has details on erasing a sector or the entire chip, or suspend ing/resuming the erase\noperation.\nAfter the system writes the autoselect command sequence, the de vice enters the autoselect mode. The system can then read\nautoselect codes from the inter nal register (which is separate from the memory array) on DQ7–DQ0. Standard read cycle timings\napply in this mode. Refer to Autoselect Mode on page 13  and Autoselect Command Sequence on page 22  for more information.\nICC2 in DC Characteristics on page 34  represents the active current specification for the write mode . AC Characteristics on page 36\ncontains timing specification ta bles and timing diagrams for wr ite operations.\n7.4 Program and Erase Operation Status\nDuring an erase or program opera tion, the system may check the status of the operation by reading the status bits on DQ7–DQ0.\nStandard read cycle timings and ICC read specifications apply. Refer to Write Operation Status on page 28  for more information, and\nto AC Characteristics on page 36  for timing diagrams.\n7.5 Standby Mode\nWhen the system is not reading or writing to the device, it can  place the device in the standby mode. In this mode, current\nconsumption is greatly reduced , and the outputs are placed in t he high impedance st ate, independent o f the OE# input. \nThe device enters the CMOS stand by mode when the CE# and RESET#  pins are both held at VCC \uf0b1 0.3 V. (Note that this is a more\nrestricted voltage range than VIH.) If CE# and RESET# are held at VIH, but not within VCC \uf0b1 0.3 V, the device will be in the standby\nmode, but the standby current will be greater. The device requi res standard access time (tCE) for read access when the device is in\neither of these standby modes, before it is ready to read data.\nIf the device is desele cted during erasure or programming, the device draws active current unt il the operation is completed.\nICC3 and ICC4 represents the standby current spec ification shown in the table  in DC Characteristics on page 34 .\nDocument Number: 002-00778 Rev. *Q Page 11 of 50S29AL008J\n7.6 Automatic Sleep Mode\nThe automatic sleep mode minimizes Flash device energy consumpt ion. The device automatically enables this mode when\naddresses remain stable for tACC + 30 ns. The automatic sleep mode is independent of the CE#, W E#, and OE# control signals.\nStandard address access timings provide new data when addresses  are changed. While in sleep mo de, output data is latched and\nalways available to the system. ICC4 in the DC Characteristics on page 34  represents the automatic sleep mode current\nspecification.\n7.7 RESET#: Hardware Reset Pin\nThe RESET# pin provides a hardware method of resetting the devi ce to reading array data. When the system drives the RESET#\npin to VIL for at least a period of tRP, the device immediately terminates  any operation in progress, tri states all data output pins, and\nignores all read/write attempts f or the duration of the RESET# pulse. The device also resets the internal state machine to rea ding\narray data. The operat ion that was interr upted should be reinit iated once the device is ready t o accept another command sequen ce,\nto ensure data integrity.\nCurrent is reduced for the duration of the RESET# pulse. When R ESET# is held at VSS ±0.3 V, the device draws CMOS standby\ncurrent (ICC4). If RESET# is held at VIL but not within VSS ±0.3/0.1 V, the standby current will be greater.\nThe RESET# pin may be tied to the  system reset ci rcuitry. A sys tem reset would thus also reset the Flash memory, enabling the\nsystem to read the boot-up firmware from the Flash memory. Note  that the CE# pin should only go to VIL after RESET# has gone to\nVIH. Keeping CE# at VIL from power up through the first read could cause the first rea d to retrieve erroneous data.\nIf RESET# is asserted during a pr ogram or erase operation, the RY/BY# pin remains a 0 (busy) until the internal reset operation is\ncomplete, which requires a time of tREADY  (during Embedded Algorithms). The system can thus monitor RY/B Y# to determine\nwhether the reset operation is complete. If RESET# is asserted when a program or erase operation is not executing (RY/BY# pin is\n1), the reset operation is completed within a time of tREADY (not during Embedded Algorithms). The system can read data tRH after\nthe RESET# pin returns to VIH.\nRefer to the tables in AC Characteristics on page 36  for RESET# parameters and to Figure 15 on page 37  for the timing diagram.\n7.8 Output Disable Mode\nWhen the OE# input is at VIH, output from the devi ce is disabled. The output pins are place d in the high im pedance state.\nTable 2.

This mode is primarily intended for pr ogramming equipment to automatically match a device to be\nprogrammed with its corresponding programming algorithm. Howeve r, the autoselect codes can al so be accessed in-system\nthrough the command register.\nWhen using programming equipment, the autoselect mode requires VID (8.5 V to 12.5 V) on address pin A9. Address pins A6 and\nA3–A0 must be as shown in Table 6 . In addition, when verifying sector group protection, the sect or address must appear on the\nappropriate highest order address bits (see T a b l e2  o np a g e1 1  and Table 4 on page 12 ). Table 6  shows the remaining address bits\nthat are don’t care. When all necessary bits have been set as r equired, the programming equipment may then read the\ncorresponding identifie r code on DQ7-DQ0.\nTo access the autosele ct codes in-system, th e host system can i ssue the autoselect c ommand via the command  register, as shown\nin Table 13 on page 26 . This method does not require VID. See Command Definitions on page 22  for details on using the autoselect\nmode.\nLegend\nL = Logic Low = VIL; H = Logic High = VIH; SA = Sector Address; X = Don’t care\nNote\nThe autoselect codes may also be accessed  in-system via command sequences.

The hardware sector group unprotection feature re-enables bo th program and erase operations\nin previously protected sector groups. Sector group protection/ unprotection can be imple mented via two methods.\nSector protection/un protection requires VID on the RESET# pin only, and can  be implemented either in-syste m or via programming\nequipment. Figure 4 on page 16  shows the algorithms and Figure 24 on page 42  shows the timing diagram. This method uses\nstandard microprocessor bus cycle timing. For sector group unpr otect, all unprotected sector gr oups must first be protected pr ior to\nthe first sector group  unprotect write cycle.\nThe device is shipped with all sector groups unprotected. Cypre ss offers the option of programming and protecting sector group s at\nits factory prior to shipping t he device through Cypress Progra mming Service. Contact a Cypre ss representative for details.\nIt is possible to dete rmine whether a sector group is protected  or unprotected. See Autoselect Mode on page 13  for details.\nTable 7.

The Sector Group\nUnprotect mode is activated b y setting the RESET# pin to VID. During this mode, formerly protected sector groups can be\nprogrammed or erased by selecting the sector addresses. Once VID is removed from the RESET# pin, all the previously protected\nsector groups are protected again.

Secured Silicon Sect or Flash Memory Region\nThe Secured Silicon Sector featur e provides a 256-byte Flash me mory region that enables permanent  part identification through an\nElectronic Serial Number (ESN). The Secured Silicon Sector uses  a Secured Silicon Sector Indicator Bit (DQ7) to indicate wheth er\nor not the Secured Silicon Sector is locked when shipped from t he factory. This bit is permanently set at the factory and cann ot be\nchanged, which prevents cloning of a factory-locked part. This ensures the security of the ESN once the product is shipped to the\nfield.\nCypress offers the device with the Secured Silicon Sector eithe r factory-locked or customer-locka ble. The factory-locked versi on is\nalways protected when shipped from the factory, and has the Sec ured Silicon Sector Indicator Bit permanently set to a 1. The\ncustomer-lockable version is shipped with the Secured Silicon S ector unprotected, allowing customers to utilize the that secto r in\nany manner they choose. The customer-lockable version has the S ecured Silicon Sector Indicator Bit permanently set to a 0. Thus,\nthe Secured Silicon Sector Indicat or Bit prevents customer-lock able devices from being used to replace devices that are factor y\nlocked.\nThe system accesses the Secur ed Silicon Sector through a comman d sequence (see “Enter Secured Silicon Sector/Exit Secured Silicon Sector\nCommand Sequence” on page 23). After the system write s the Enter Secured Silicon S ector command sequence, it may read the Secured\nSilicon Sector by using the addr esses normally occupied by the boot sectors. This mode of operation continues until the system\nissues the Exit Secured Silicon Sector command sequence, or unt il power is removed from the device. On power-up, or following a\nhardware reset, the device reve rts to sending commands to the b oot sectors.\n8.1 Factory Locked: Secured Silicon Sector Programmed \nand Protected at the Factory\nIn a factory locked de vice, the Secured Silicon Sector is prote cted when the device is shipped f rom the factory. The Secured S ilicon\nSector cannot be modified in any  way. The device is available p re-programmed with one of the following:\n\uf06eA random, secure ESN only.\n\uf06eCustomer code through the ExpressFlash service.\n\uf06eBoth a random, secure ESN and cus tomer code through the Express Flash service.\nIn devices that have an ESN, a Bottom Boot device has the 16-by te (8-word) ESN in sector 0 at addresses 00000h–0000Fh in byte\nmode (or 00000h–00007h in word mode). In the Top Boot device, t he ESN is in sector 18 at addresses FFFF0h–FFFFFh in byte\nmode (or 7FFF8h–7FFFFh in word mode).\nCustomers may opt to have their code programmed by Cypress thro ugh the Cypress ExpressFlash s ervice. Cypress programs the\ncustomer’s code, with or without the random ESN. The devices ar e then shipped from the Cypress factory with the Secured Silico n\nSector permanently locked. Conta ct a Cypress representative for  details on using the Cypress ExpressFlash service.\n8.2 Customer Lockable: Secured  Silicon Sector NOT Programmed \nor Protected at the Factory\nThe customer lockable version al lows the Secured Silicon Sector  to be programmed once, and th en permanently locked after it\nships from Cypress. N ote that the unlock bypass functions is no t available when programming  the Secured Silicon Sector.\nThe Secured Silicon Sector area c an be protected using the foll owing procedures: \n\uf06eWrite the three-cycle Enter Secu red Silicon Region command sequ ence, and then foll ow the in-system sec tor group protect \nalgorithm as shown in Figure 4 on page 16 , substituting the sector group address with the Secured Silico n Sector group address \n(A0=0, A1=1, A2=0, A3=1, A4=1, A 5=0, A6=0, A7=0). Note that thi s method is only applicable to  the Secured Silicon Sector.\n\uf06eTo verify the protect/ unprotect status of  the Secured Silicon S ector, follow the algorithm shown in Figure 5 on page 18 .\nOnce the Secured Silicon Sector is locked and verified, the sys tem must write the Exit Secured Silicon Sector Region command\nsequence to return to reading and writing the remainder of the array.\nThe Secured Silicon Sector protection must be used with caution  since, once protected, there is no procedure available for\nunprotecting the Secured Silicon Sector area, and none of the b its in the Secured Silicon Sector memory space can be modified in\nany way. \nDocument Number: 002-00778 Rev. *Q Page 18 of 50S29AL008J\nFigure 5.

Common Flash Memory Interface (CFI)\nThe Common Flash Interface (CFI ) specification outlines device and host system software interr ogation handshake, which allows\nspecific vendor-specified software algorithms to be used for en tire families of devices. Software support can then be device-\nindependent, JEDEC ID-independent, and forward- and backward-co mpatible for the specified flas h device families. Flash vendors\ncan standardize their existing interfaces for long-term compati bility. \nThis device enters the CFI Query  mode when the system writes th e CFI Query command, 98h, to address 55h in word mode (or\naddress AAh in byte mode), any time the device is ready to read  array data. The system can read CFI information at the address es\ngiven in Table 9  to Table 12 on page 20 . In word mode, the upper address bits (A7–MSB) must be all zer os. To terminate reading\nCFI data, the system must write the reset command. \nThe system can also write the CFI query command when the device  is in the autoselect mode. The device enters the CFI query\nmode, and the system can read CFI data at the addresses given i n the following tabl es. The system must write the reset command\nto return the device to  the autoselect mode.\nTable 9.

In addition, the following hardware data\nprotection measures prevent accidental erasure or programming, which might otherwise be caused by spurious system level signal s\nduring VCC power-up and power-down tran sitions, or from system noise.\n9.1.1 Low VCC Write Inhibit\nWhen VCC is less than VLKO, the device does not accept any  write cycles. This protects da ta during VCC power-up and power-down.\nThe command register and all inte rnal program/erase circuits ar e disabled, and the device resets . Subsequent writes are ignore d\nuntil VCC is greater than VLKO. The system must provide the proper signals to the control pin s to prevent unintentional writes when\nVCC is greater than VLKO.\n9.1.2 Write Pulse Glitch  Protection\nNoise pulses of less than 5 ns (ty pical) on OE#, CE# or WE# do not initiate a  write cycle.\n9.1.3 Logical Inhibit\nWrite cycles are inhibited by  holding any one of OE# = VIL, CE# = VIH or WE# = VIH. To initiate a write cycl e, CE# and WE# must be\na logical zero while OE# is a logical one.\n9.1.4 Power-Up Write Inhibit\nIf WE# = CE# = VIL and OE# = VIH during power up, the device does  not accept commands on the ri sing edge of WE#.

Command Definitions\nWriting specific address and data commands or sequences into th e command register initiates device operations. Table 13\non page 26  defines the valid register command sequences. Writing incorrect  address and data values  or writing them in the\nimproper sequence  resets the device to reading array data. \nAll addresses are latched on the falling edge of WE# or CE#, wh ichever happens later. All data i s latched on the rising edge o f WE#\nor CE#, whichever happens first. R efer to the appropriate timin g diagrams in AC Characteristics on page 36 .\n10.1 Reading Array Data\nThe device is automati cally set to reading array data after dev ice power-up. No commands are re quired to retrieve data. The de vice\nis also ready to read array data after completing an Embedded P rogram or Embedded Erase algorithm.\nAfter the device accepts an Erase Suspend command, the device e nters the Erase Suspend mode. The system can read array data\nusing the standard read timings, except that if it reads at an address within erase-suspended se ctors, the device outputs stat us data.\nAfter completing a programming operation in the Erase Suspend m ode, the system may once again read array data with the same\nexception. See Erase Suspend/Erase Resume Commands on page 25  for more information on this mode.\nThe system must  issue the reset command to re-enable the device for reading ar ray data if DQ5 goes high, or while in the autoselect\nmode. See Reset Command on page 22 .\nSee also Requirements for Reading Array Data on page 10  for more information. The Read Operations on page 36  provides the\nread parameters, and Figure 14 on page 36  shows the timing diagram.\n10.2 Reset Command\nWriting the reset command to the device resets the device to re ading array data. Address bits are don’t care for this command.  \nThe reset command may be writte n between the sequ ence cycles in  an erase command sequence before erasing begins. This\nresets the device to reading array data. Once erasure begins, h owever, the device ignores reset  commands until the operation i s\ncomplete.\nIf the reset command is issued a fter sending the program comman d, the command will be mistakenly treated as data and will be\nprogrammed to a memory location instead of resetting the device . For resetting the device during program operation, reset\ncommand can be sent only till before sending the program comman d. After the program command has been sent, 0xF0 will be\ntreated as data.\nThe reset command may be written between the sequence cycles in  an autoselect command sequenc e. Once in the autoselect\nmode, the reset command must  be written to return to reading  array data (also  applies to au toselect during Erase Suspend).\nIf DQ5 goes high during a program  or erase operation, writing t he reset command returns the device to reading array data (also\napplies during Erase Suspend).\n10.3 Autoselect Command Sequence\nThe autoselect command  sequence allows the host system to acces s the manufacturer and devices  codes, and determine whether\nor not a sector is protected. Table 13 on page 26  shows the address and data require ments. This method is an alt ernative to that\nshown in Table 6 on page 13 , which is intended for PROM  programmers and requires VID on address bit A9.\nThe autoselect command sequence is initiated by writing two unl ock cycles, followed by the autoselect command. The device then\nenters the autoselect mode, and the system may read at any addr ess any number of times, wit hout initiating another command\nsequence. \nA read cycle at address XX00h retri eves the manufacturer code. A read cycle at address XX01h ret urns the device code. A read\ncycle containing a sector address (SA) and the address 02h in w ord mode (or 04h in byte mode) returns 01h if that sector is\nprotected, or 00h if it i s unprotected. Refer to Table 2 on page 11  and Table 4 on page 12  for valid sector addresses.\nThe system must write the reset command to e xit the autoselect mode and return to r eading array data.\nDocument Number: 002-00778 Rev. *Q Page 23 of 50S29AL008J\n10.4 Enter Secured Silicon Sector/Exit Secure d Silicon Sector \nCommand Sequence\nThe Secured Silicon Sector region provides a secured data area containing a random, sixteen-byte electronic serial number (ESN ).\nThe system can access the Secur ed Silicon Sector region by issu ing the three-cycle Enter S ecured Silicon Sector command\nsequence. The device continues t o access the Secu red Silicon Se ctor region until the system i ssues the four-cycle Exit Secured\nSilicon Sector command sequence. The Exit Secured Silicon Secto r command sequence returns the device to normal operation.\n13S29AL008J Command Definitions on page 26  shows the addresses and data requirements for both command seq uences. Note\nthat the unlock bypass mode is not available when the device en ters the Secured Silicon Sector. See also “Secured Silicon Sector\nFlash Memory Region” on page 17 for furthe r information. \n10.5 Word/Byte Program Command Sequence\nThe system may program the devic e by word or byte, depending on  the state of the BYTE# pin. Programming is a four-bus-cycle\noperation. The program command s equence is initiated by writing  two unlock write cycles, followed by the program set-up\ncommand. The program address and data are written next, which i n turn initiate the Embedded Program algorithm. The system is\nnot required to provide further contr ols or timings. The device au tomatically generates the program pulses and verifies the\nprogrammed cell margin. Table 13 on page 26  shows the address and data requirements for the byte program c ommand sequence.\nWhen the Embedded Program algorithm is complete, the device the n returns to reading array data and addresses are no longer\nlatched. The system can determine  the status of the program ope ration by using DQ7, DQ6, or RY/BY#. See Write Operation Status\non page 28  for information on these status bits. \nAny commands written to the device during the Embedded Program Algorithm are ignored. Note that a hardware reset  immediately\nterminates the programming operat ion. The Byte Program command sequence should be reinitiated once the device has reset to\nreading array data, to ensure data integrity.\nProgramming is allowed in any sequence and across sector bounda ries. A bit cannot be programmed from a 0 back to a 1.\nAttempting to do so may halt the operation and set DQ5 to 1, or cause the Data# Polling algorithm to indicate the operatio n was\nsuccessful. However, a succeedin g read will show that the data is still 0. Only erase operations can convert a 0 to a 1.\n10.6 Unlock Bypass Command Sequence\nThe unlock bypass feature allows  the system to program bytes or  words to the device faster than using the standard program\ncommand sequence. The unlock by pass command sequence is initiat ed by first writing tw o unlock cycles. This i s followed by a th ird\nwrite cycle containing the un lock bypass command, 20h. The devi ce then enters the unlock bypass mode. A two-cycle unlock\nbypass program command sequence is all that is required to prog ram in this mode. The first cycle in this sequence contains the\nunlock bypass program command, A 0h; the second cycle contains t he program address and data. Addi tional data is programmed in\nthe same manner. This mode dispenses with the initial two unloc k cycles required in the standard program command sequence,\nresulting in faster to tal programming time. Table 13 on page 26  shows the requirements for the command sequence.\nDuring the unlock bypass mode, only the Unlock Bypass Program a nd Unlock Bypass Reset commands are valid. To exit the unlock\nbypass mode, the system must i ssue the two-cycle unlock bypass reset command sequence. The fir st cycle must con tain the data\n90h; the sec ond cycle the data 00h. Addresses are don’t care fo r both cycles. The device then  returns to re ading array data.\nFigure 6 on page 24  illustrates the algorithm for the program operation. See Erase/Program Operations on page 39  for parameters,\nand to Figure 18 on page 39  for timing diagrams.\nDocument Number: 002-00778 Rev. *Q Page 24 of 50S29AL008J\nFigure 6.  Program Operation\nNote\nSee Table 13 on page 26  for program command sequence.\n10.7 Chip Erase Command Sequence\nChip erase is a six bus cycle op eration. The chip erase command  sequence is initiated by writing two unlock cycles, followed b y a\nset-up command. Two ad ditional unlock writ e cycles are then fol lowed by the chip erase command, which in turn invokes the\nEmbedded Erase algorithm. The device does not require the system to preprogram prior to erase. The Embedded Erase algorithm\nautomatically preprograms and ve rifies the entire memory for an  all zero data pattern prior to electrical erase. The system is  not\nrequired to provide any controls or timings during these operat ions. Table 13 on page 26  shows the address and data requirements\nfor the chip erase command sequence.\nAny commands written to the chip during the Embedded Erase algo rithm are ignored. Note that a hardware reset  during the chip\nerase operation immediately te rminates the operation. The Chip Erase command sequence should be  reinitiated once the device\nhas returned to readi ng array data, to ensure data integrity.\nThe system can determine the stat us of the erase operation by u sing DQ7, DQ6, DQ2, or RY/BY#. See Write Operation Status\non page 28  for information on these status  bits. When the Embedded Erase algorithm is complete, the device returns to reading\narray data and addresses are no longer latched. \nFigure 7 on page 26  illustrates the algorithm for the erase operation. See Erase/Program Operations on page 39  for parameters,\nand Figure 19 on page 40  for timing diagrams.START\nWrite Program\nCommand Sequence\nData Poll \nfrom System\nVerify Data?No\nYes\nLast Address?No\nYes\nProgramming\n CompletedIncrement AddressEmbedded\nProgram\nalgorithm\n in progress\nDocument Number: 002-00778 Rev. *Q Page 25 of 50S29AL008J\n10.8 Sector Erase Command Sequence\nSector erase is a six bus cycle operation. The sector erase com mand sequence is initiated by w riting two unlock cycles, follow ed by\na set-up command. Two additional unlock write cycles are then f ollowed by the address of the sector to be erased, and the sect or\nerase command. Table 13 on page 26  shows the address and data requi rements for the sector erase c ommand sequence.\nThe device does not require the system to preprogram the memory prior to erase. Th e Embedded Erase algorithm automatically\nprograms and verifies the sector for an all zero data pattern p rior to electrical erase. The syst em is not required to provide  any\ncontrols or timings during these operations. \nAfter the command sequence is wri tten, a sector erase time-out of 50 µs begins. During the time-out period, additional sector\naddresses and sector erase comma nds may be written. However, th ese additional erase command s are only one bus cycle long\nand should be identical to the sixth cycle of the standard eras e command explained above. Loading the sector erase buffer may be\ndone in any sequence, and the number of sectors may be from one  sector to all sectors. The time between these additional cycle s\nmust be less than 50 µs, otherwis e the last address and command  might not be accepted, and erasure may begin. It is\nrecommended that processor interrupts be disabled during this t ime to ensure all commands are  accepted. The interrupts can be\nre-enabled after the last Sector Erase command is written. If t he time between additional sector erase commands can be assumed\nto be less than 50 µs, the system need not monitor DQ3. Any command other than Sector Erase or Erase Suspend during the\ntime-out period resets the device to reading array data.  The system must rewrite the comma nd sequence and any additiona l\nsector addresse s and commands.\nThe system can monitor DQ3 to det ermine if the sector erase tim er has timed out. (See DQ3: Sector Erase Timer on page 31 .) The\ntime-out begins from the rising  edge of the final WE# pulse in the command sequence.\nOnce the sector erase operation has begun, only the Erase Suspe nd command is valid. All other commands are ignored. Note that\na hardware reset  during the sector erase operation immediately terminates the o peration. The Sector Erase command sequence\nshould be reinitiated once the device has returned to reading a rray data, to ensur e data integrity.\nWhen the Embedded Erase algorithm i s complete, the device retur ns to reading array data and addresses are no longer latched.\nThe system can determine the stat us of the erase  operation by u sing DQ7, DQ6, DQ2, or RY/BY#. (Refer to Write Operation Status\non page 28  for information on these status bits.)\nFigure 7 on page 26  illustrates the algorithm for t he erase operation. Refer to Erase/Program Oper ations on page 39  for parameters,\nand to Figure 19 on page 40  for timing diagrams.\n10.9 Erase Suspend/Erase Resume Commands\nThe Erase Suspend command allows the system to interrupt a sect or erase operation and then read data from, or program data to,\nany sector not selected for erasure. This command is valid only  during the sector erase operation, including the 50 µs time-ou t\nperiod during the sector erase c ommand sequence. The Erase Susp end command is ignored if written during the chip erase\noperation or Embedded Program algor ithm. Writing the Erase Susp end command during the Sector Erase time-out immediately\nterminates the time-out period and suspends the erase operation . Addresses are don’t-cares  when writing the Erase Suspend\ncommand.\nWhen the Erase Suspend command is written during a sector erase  operation, the device requires a maximum of 35 µs to suspend\nthe erase operation. However, when the Erase Suspend command is  written during the sector erase time-out, the device\nimmediately terminates the time- out period and suspends the era se operation.\nAfter the erase operation has been suspended, the system can re ad array data from or program data to any sector not selected f or\nerasure. (The device “erase susp ends” all sectors selected for erasure.) Normal read and write timings and command definitions\napply. Reading at any address wit hin erase-suspended sectors pr oduces status data on DQ7–DQ0. The system can use DQ7, or\nDQ6 and DQ2 together, to determine if a sector is actively eras ing or is erase-suspended. See Write Operation Status on page 28\nfor information on these status bits.\nAfter an erase-suspended program operation is complete, the sys tem can once again read array data within non-suspended\nsectors. The system can determine the status of the program ope ration using the DQ7 or DQ6 status bits, just as in the standar d\nprogram operation. See Write Operation Status on page 28  for more information.\nThe system may also write the au toselect command sequence when the device is in the Erase Suspend mode. The device allows\nreading autoselect codes even at addresses within erasing secto rs, since the codes are not stored in the memory array. When th e\ndevice exits the autoselect mode, the device reverts to the Era se Suspend mode, and is ready f or another valid operation. See\nAutoselect Command Sequence on page 22  for more information.\nDocument Number: 002-00778 Rev. *Q Page 26 of 50S29AL008J\nThe system must write the Erase Resume command (address bits ar e don’t care ) to exit the erase suspend mode and continue the\nsector erase operation. Further  writes of the Resume command ar e ignored. Another Erase Suspend command can be written after\nthe device has resumed erasing.\nFigure 7.  Erase Operation\nNotes\n1.

Write Operation Status\nThe device provides several bits to determine the status of a w rite operation: DQ2, DQ3, DQ5, DQ6, DQ7, and RY/BY#. Table 14\non page 31  and the following subsections describe the functions of these bits. DQ7, RY/BY#, and DQ6 each offer a method for\ndetermining whether a program or erase operation is complete or  in progress. These three bits are discussed first.\n11.1 DQ7: Data# Polling\nThe Data# Polling bit, DQ7, indicates to the host system whethe r an Embedded Algorithm is in progress or completed, or whether\nthe device is in Erase Suspend. Data# Polling is valid after th e rising edge of the final WE# pul se in the program or erase co mmand\nsequence.\nDuring the Embedded Program algorithm, the device outputs on DQ 7 the complement o f the datum programmed to DQ7. This DQ7\nstatus also applies to programmi ng during Erase Suspend. When t he Embedded Program algorithm is  complete, the device outputs\nthe datum programmed to DQ7. The system must prov ide the progra m address to read valid status information on DQ7. If a program\naddress falls within a protected sector, Data# Polling on DQ7 i s active for approximately 1 µs, then the device returns to rea ding\narray data.\nDuring the Embedded Erase algori thm, Data# Polling produces a 0 on DQ7. When the Embedded Eras e algorithm is complete, or if\nthe device enters the Erase Suspend mode, Data# Polling produce s a 1 on DQ7. This is analogous to the complement/true datum\noutput described for the Embedd ed Program algorithm: the erase function changes all the bits in a sector to 1; prior to this, the\ndevice outputs the complement , or 0. The system must provide an addr ess within any of the sectors selected for erasure to read\nvalid status information on DQ7.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if all sectors sele cted for erasing are protected, Data# Polling on DQ7 is active for\napproximately 100 µs, then the device returns to reading array data. If not all selected sectors are protected, the Embedded E rase\nalgorithm erases the unprotected sectors, and ignores the selec ted sectors that are protected.\nWhen the system detects DQ7 has c hanged from the complement to true data, it can read valid data at DQ7–DQ0 on the following\nread cycles. This is because DQ7 may change asynchronously with  DQ0–DQ6 while Output Enable (OE#) is asserted low.\nFigure 21 on page 41 , illustrates this.\nWrite Operation Status on page 31  shows the outputs for Data# Polling on DQ7. Figure 9 on page 30  shows the Data# Polling\nalgorithm.\nFigure 8.  Data# Polling Algorithm\nNotes\n1. VA = Valid address for programming. During a sector erase operat ion, a valid address is an address within any sector selected  for erasure. During chip erase, a valid \naddress is any non-prot ected sector address.\n2.

The\nRY/BY# status is valid after the rising edge of the final WE# p ulse in the command sequence. Since RY/BY# is an open-drain out put,\nseveral RY/BY# pins can be tied  together in parallel with a pul l-up resistor to VCC.\nIf the output is low (Bu sy), the device is actively erasing or programming. (This includes progr amming in the Erase Suspend mo de.)\nIf the output is high (Ready), t he device is ready to read arra y data (including during the Erase Suspend mode), or is in the standby\nmode.\nTable 14 on page 31  shows the outputs fo r RY/BY#. Figures Figure 14 on page 36 , Figure 15 on page 37 , Figure 18 on page 39\nand Figure 19 on page 40  shows RY/BY# for read, reset, pr ogram, and erase operations, r espectively.\n11.3 DQ6: Toggle Bit I\nToggle Bit I on DQ6 indicates whether an Embedded Program or Er ase algorithm is in progress or c omplete, or whether the device\nhas entered the Erase Suspend mode. Toggle Bit I may be read at  any address, and is valid after the rising edge of the final W E#\npulse in the command sequence (pr ior to the program or erase op eration), and during the sector erase time-out.\nDuring an Embedded Program or Era se algorithm operation, succes sive read cycles to any address cause DQ6 to toggle. (The\nsystem may use either OE# or CE#  to contro l the read  cycles.) W hen the operation is compl ete, DQ6 stops toggling.\nAfter an erase command sequence is written, if all sectors sele cted for erasing are protected, D Q6 toggles for approximately 1 00 µs,\nthen returns to reading array data. If not all selected sectors  are protected, the Embedded Erase algorithm erases the unprote cted\nsectors, and ignores the selected sectors that are protected. \nThe system can use DQ6 and DQ2 together to determine whether a sector is actively erasing or is erase-suspended. When the\ndevice is actively erasing (t hat is, the Embedded Erase algorit hm is in progress), DQ6 toggles . When the device enters the Era se\nSuspend mode, DQ6 stops toggling. H owever, the system must also  use DQ2 to determine which sectors are erasing or erase-\nsuspended. Alternatively, th e system can use DQ7 (see DQ7: Data# Polling on page 28 ).\nIf a program address falls withi n a protected sector, DQ6 toggl es for approximately 1 µs after  the program command sequence is\nwritten, then returns to reading array data.\nDQ6 also toggles during the eras e-suspend-program  mode, and sto ps toggling once the Embedded Prog ram algorithm is complete.\nTable 14 on page 31  shows the outputs for Toggle Bit I on DQ6. Figure 9 on page 30  shows the toggle bit algorithm in flowchart\nform, and Reading Toggle Bits DQ6/DQ2 on page 30  explains the algorithm. Figure 22 on page 41  shows the toggle bit timing\ndiagrams. Figure 23 on page 41  shows the differences between DQ2 and DQ6 in graphical form. S ee also the subsection on DQ2:\nToggle Bit II .\n11.4 DQ2: Toggle Bit II\nThe “Toggle Bit II” on DQ2, when used with DQ6, indicates wheth er a particular sector is actively erasing (that is, the Embedd ed\nErase algorithm is in progress), or whether that sector is eras e-suspended. Toggle Bit II is valid after the rising edge of th e final WE#\npulse in the command sequence.\nDQ2 toggles when the system reads at addresses within those sec tors that have been selected f or erasure. (The system may use\neither OE# or CE# to control the read cycles.) But DQ2 cannot d istinguish whether the sector is actively erasing or is erase-\nsuspended. DQ6, by comparison, indicates whether the device is actively erasing, or is in Eras e Suspend, but cannot distinguis h\nwhich sectors are selected for erasure. Thus, both status bits are required for sector and mode information. Refer to Table 14\non page 31  to compare outputs for DQ2 and DQ6. \nFigure 9 on page 30  shows the toggle bit algorithm in flowchart form, and the sect ion Reading Toggle Bits DQ6/DQ2 on page 30\nexplains the algorithm. See also the DQ6: Toggle Bit I on page 29  subsection. Figure 22 on page 41  shows the toggle bit timing\ndiagram. Figure 23 on page 41  shows the differences between  DQ2 and DQ6 in graphical form. \nDocument Number: 002-00778 Rev. *Q Page 30 of 50S29AL008J\n11.5 Reading Toggle Bits DQ6/DQ2\nRefer to Figure 9 on page 30  for the following discussion. Whenever the system initially be gins reading toggle bit status, it must read\nDQ7–DQ0 at least twice in a row  to determine whether a toggle b it is toggling. Typically, the system would note and store the value\nof the toggle bit after the first read. After the second read, the system would compare the new v alue of the toggle bit with t he first. If\nthe toggle bit is not toggling, the device has completed the pr ogram or erase operation. The system can read array data on DQ7 –\nDQ0 on the following read cycle.\nHowever, if after the initial two read cycles, the system deter mines that the toggle bit is still toggling, the system also sh ould note\nwhether the value of DQ5 is h igh (see the section on DQ5). If i t is, the system should then dete rmine again whether the toggle  bit is\ntoggling, since the toggle bit m ay have stopped toggling just a s DQ5 went high. If the toggle bit is no longer toggling, the d evice has\nsuccessfully completed the progra m or erase operation. If it is  still toggling, the device did not complete the operation succ essfully,\nand the system must write the reset comma nd to return to readin g array data. \nThe remaining scenario is that t he system initially determines that the toggle bit is toggling and DQ5 has not gone high. The system\nmay continue to monitor the toggle bit and DQ5 through successi ve read cycles, determining the status as described in the prev ious\nparagraph. Alternativ ely, it may choose to  perform other system  tasks. In this case, the system m ust start at the beginning of  the\nalgorithm when it returns to det ermine the status  of the operat ion (top of Figure 9 on page 30 ).\nFigure 9.

Under these conditions DQ 5\nproduces a 1. This is a failure condition tha t indicates the program or era se cycle was not succe ssfully completed. \nThe DQ5 failure condition may appear if the system tries to pro gram a 1 to a location that is previously programmed to 0. Only an\nerase operation can change a 0 back to a 1. Under this condition, the device halts the operation, and when  the operation has\nexceeded the timing limits, DQ5 produces a 1.\nUnder both these cond itions, the system must issue the reset co mmand to return the device to reading array data.\n11.7 DQ3: Sector Erase Timer\nAfter writing a sector erase command sequence, the system may r ead DQ3 to determine whether or not an erase operation has\nbegun. (The sector erase timer does not apply to the chip erase  command.) If additional sectors are selected for erasure, the entire\ntime-out also applies after eac h additional sector erase comman d. When the time-out is complete, DQ3 switches from 0 to 1. The\nsystem may ignore DQ3 if the system can guarantee that the time  between additional sector erase commands will always be less\nthan 50 \uf06ds. See also Sector Erase Command Sequence on page 25 .\nAfter the sector erase command s equence is writt en, the system should read the status on DQ7 (Data# Polling) or DQ6 (Toggle Bi t\nI) to ensure the device has accepted the command sequence, and then read DQ3. If DQ3 is 1, the internally con trolled erase cycle\nhas begun; all further commands ( other than Erase Suspend) are ignored until the erase operati on is complete. If DQ3 is 0, the\ndevice will accept additional sector erase commands. To ensure the command has been accepted, the system software should\ncheck the status of DQ3 prior to and following each subsequent sector erase command. If DQ3 is h igh on the second status check ,\nthe last command migh t not have been accepted. The following ta ble shows the outputs for DQ3. \nNotes\n1. DQ5 switches to 1 when an Embedded Program or Embedded Erase oper ation has exceeded the maximum timing limits. See DQ5: Exceeded Timing Limits \non page 31  for more information.\n2.

Erase and Programming Performance\nNotes\n1. Typical program and erase times assume the following conditions: 25°C, VCC = 3.0 V, 100,000 cycles, checkerboard data pattern.\n2. Under worst case conditions of 90°C, VCC = 2.7 V, 1,000,000 cycles.\n3. The typical chip programming time is considerably less than the maximum chip programming time listed, since most bytes progra m faster than the maximum program \ntimes listed.\n4. In the pre-programming step of the Embedded Erase al gorithm, all bytes are programmed to 00h before erasure.\n5. System-level overhead is the time required to execute the two- or four-bus-cycle sequence for the program command. See Table 13 on page 26  for further information \non command definitions.\n6. The device has a minimum erase and program cycle endurance of 100,000 cycles per sector.\n19. TSOP and BGA Pin Capacitance\nNotes\n1. Sampled, not 100% tested.\n2.
