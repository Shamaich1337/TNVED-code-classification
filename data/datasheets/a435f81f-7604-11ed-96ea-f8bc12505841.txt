If the active state link PM is enabled, then the link automatically\nsaves power when idle using the L0s and L1 states. PM active state NAK, PM PME, and PME-to-ACK\nmessages are supported. Standard PCI bus power management features provide several low power modes,\nwhich enable the host system to further reduce power consumption.\nThe bridge has additional capabilities including, but not limited to, serial IRQ with MSI messages, serial\nEEPROM, power override, clock run, PCI Express clock request and PCI bus LOCK . Also, five general-purpose\ninputs and outputs (GPIOs) are provided for further system control and customization.\nRobust pipeline architecture is implemented to minimize system latency across the bridge. If parity errors are\ndetected, then packet poisoning is supported for both upstream and downstream operations.\nThe PCI local bus is fully compliant with the PCI Local Bus Specification  (Revision 2.3) and associated\nprogramming model. Also, the bridge supports the standard PCI-to-PCI bridge programming model. The PCI bus\ninterface is 32-bit and can operate at either 25 MHz, 33 MHz, 50 MHz, or 66 MHz. Also, the PCI interface\nprovides fair arbitration and buffered clock outputs for up to 6 subordinate devices.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nPCI Express\nTransmitterPCI Express\nReceiver\nPCI Bus InterfaceConfiguration and\nMemory RegisterGPIO\nSerial\nEEPROM\nSerial\nIRQReset\nControllerClock\nGeneratorPower\nMgmt\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Bridge Reset Features\nThere are five bridge reset options that include internally-generated power-on reset, resets generated by\nasserting input terminals, and software-initiated resets that are controlled by sending a PCI Express hot reset or\nsetting a configuration register bit. Table 8-1  identifies these reset sources and describes how the bridge\nresponds to each reset.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nTable 8-1. XIO2001 Reset Options\nRESET OPTION XIO2001 FEATURE RESET RESPONSE\nBridge internally-\ngenerated\npower-on resetDuring a power-on cycle, the bridge asserts an internal reset\nand monitors the V DD_15_COMB  terminal. When this terminal\nreaches 90% of the nominal input voltage specification,\npower is considered stable. After stable power, the bridge\nmonitors the PCI Express reference clock (REFCLK) and\nwaits 10 μs after active clocks are detected. Then, internal\npower-on reset is deasserted.When the internal power-on reset is asserted, all control\nregisters, state machines, sticky register bits, and power\nmanagement state machines are initialized to their default\nstate.\nIn addition, the XIO2001 asserts the internal PCI bus\nreset.\nGlobal reset\ninput\nGRSTWhen GRST is asserted low, an internal power-on reset\noccurs. This reset is asynchronous and functions during\nboth normal power states and V AUX power states.When GRST is asserted low, all control registers, state\nmachines, sticky register bits, and power management\nstate machines are initialized to their default state. In\naddition, the bridge asserts PCI bus reset ( PRST). When\nthe rising edge of GRST occurs, the bridge samples the\nstate of all static control inputs and latches the information\ninternally. If an external serial EEPROM is detected, then a\ndownload cycle is initiated. Also, the process to configure\nand initialize the PCI Express link is started. The bridge\nstarts link training within 80 ms after GRST is deasserted.\nPCI Express\nreset input\nPERSTThis XIO2001 input terminal is used by an upstream PCI\nExpress device to generate a PCI Express reset and to\nsignal a system power good condition.When PERST is asserted low, all control register bits that\nare not sticky are reset. Within the configuration register\nmaps, the sticky bits are indicated by the ☆ symbol. Also,\nall state machines that are not associated with sticky\nfunctionality are reset.When PERST is asserted low, the XIO2001 generates an\ninternal PCI Express reset as defined in the PCI Express\nspecification.\nWhen PERST transitions from low to high, a system power\ngood condition is assumed by the XIO2001.In addition, the XIO2001 asserts the internal PCI bus\nreset.\nNote:  The system must assert PERST before power is\nremoved, before REFCLK is removed or before REFCLK\nbecomes unstable.When the rising edge of PERST occurs, the XIO2001\nsamples the state of all static control inputs and latches\nthe information internally. If an external serial EEPROM is\ndetected, then a download cycle is initiated. Also, the\nprocess to configure and initialize the PCI Express link is\nstarted. The XIO2001 starts link training within 80 ms after\nPERST is deasserted.\nPCI Express\ntraining control\nhot resetThe XIO2001 responds to a training control hot reset\nreceived on the PCI Express interface. After a training\ncontrol hot reset, the PCI Express interface enters the\nDL_DOWN state.In the DL_DOWN state, all remaining configuration register\nbits and state machines are reset. All remaining bits\nexclude sticky bits and EEPROM loadable bits. All\nremaining state machines exclude sticky functionality and\nEEPROM functionality.\nWithin the configuration register maps, the sticky bits are\nindicated by the ☆ symbol and the EEPROM loadable bits\nare indicated by the † symbol.\nIn addition, the XIO2001 asserts the internal PCI bus\nreset.\nPCI bus reset\nPRSTSystem software has the ability to assert and deassert the\nPRST terminal on the secondary PCI bus interface. This\nterminal is the PCI bus reset.When bit 6 (SRST) in the bridge control register at offset\n3Eh (see Section 8.4.30 ) is asserted, the bridge asserts\nthe PRST terminal. A 0 in the SRST bit deasserts the\nPRST terminal.\n8.3.2 PCI Express Interface\nThe XIO2001 has an x1 PCI Express interface that runs at 2.5 Gb/s and is fully compliant to the PCI Express\nBase Specification , Revision 2.0. The remainder of this section describes implementation considerations for the\nXIO2001 primary PCI Express interface.\n8.3.2.1 2.5-Gb/s Transmit and Receive Links\nThe XIO2001 TX and RX terminals attach to the upstream PCI Express device over a 2.5-Gb/s high- speed\ndifferential transmit and receive PCI Express × 1 Link.

XIO2001/PCI Express Device Pin Connection Details\nPIN NAME\nCOMMENTS\nXIO2001UPSTREAM PCI\nEXPRESS DEVICE\nTXP RXPXIO2001\'s transmit positive differential pin connects to the upstream device\'s receive\npositive differential pin.\nTXN RXNXIO2001\'s transmit positive differential pin connects to the upstream device\'s receive\nnegative differential pin.\nRXP TXPXIO2001\'s transmit positive differential pin connects to the upstream device\'s receive\npositive differential pin.\nRXN TXNXIO2001\'s transmit positive differential pin connects to the upstream device\'s receive\nnegative differential pin.\nThe XIO2001 TXP and TXN terminals comprise a low-voltage, 100- Ω differentially driven signal pair. The RXP\nand RXN terminals for the XIO2001 receive a low-voltage, 100- Ω differentially driven signal pair. The XIO2001\nhas integrated 50- Ω termination resistors to V SS on both the RXP and RXN terminals eliminating the need for\nexternal components.\nEach lane of the differential signal pair must be ac-coupled. The recommended value for the series capacitor is\n0.1 μF. To minimize stray capacitance associated with the series capacitor circuit board solder pads, 0402-sized\ncapacitors are recommended.\nWhen routing a 2.5-Gb/s low-voltage, 100- Ω differentially driven signal pair, the following circuit board design\nguidelines must be considered:\n1. The PCI-Express drivers and receivers are designed to operate with adequate bit error rate margins over a\n20 ” maximum length signal pair routed through FR4 circuit board material.\n2. Each differential signal pair must be 100- Ω differential impedance with each single-ended lane measuring in\nthe range of 50 Ω to 55 Ω impedance to ground.\n3. The differential signal trace lengths associated with a PCI Express high-speed link must be length matched to\nminimize signal jitter. This length matching requirement applies only to the P and N signals within a\ndifferential pair. The transmitter differential pair does not need to be length matched to the receiver differential\npair. The absolute maximum trace length difference between the TXP signal and TXN signal must be less\nthan 5 mils. This also applies to the RXP and RXN signal pair.\n4. If a differential signal pair is broken into segments by vias, series capacitors, or connectors, the length of the\npositive signal trace must be length matched to the negative signal trace for each segment. Trace length\ndifferences over all segments are additive and must be less than 5 mils.\n5. The location of the series capacitors is critical. For add-in cards, the series capacitors are located between\nthe TXP/TXN terminals and the PCI-Express connector. In addition, the capacitors are placed near the PCI\nExpress connector. This translates to two capacitors on the motherboard for the downstream link and two\ncapacitors on the add-in card for the upstream link. If both the upstream device and the downstream device\nreside on the same circuit board, the capacitors are located near the TXP/TXN terminals for each link.\n6. The number of vias must be minimized. Each signal trace via reduces the maximum trace length by\napproximately 2 inches. For example: if 6 vias are needed, the maximum trace length is 8 inches.\n7. When routing a differential signal pair, 45 degree angles are preferred over 90 degree angles. Signal trace\nlength matching is easier with 45-degree angles and overall signal trace length is reduced.\n8. The differential signal pairs must not be routed over gaps in the power planes or ground planes. This causes\nimpedance mismatches.\n9. If vias are used to change from one signal layer to another signal layer, it is important to maintain the same\n50- Ω impedance reference to the ground plane. Changing reference planes causes signal trace impedance\nmismatches. If changing reference planes cannot be prevented, bypass capacitors connecting the two\nreference planes next to the signal trace vias will help reduce the impedance mismatch.\n10.If possible, the differential signal pairs must be routed on the top and bottom layers of a circuit board. Signal\npropagation speeds are faster on external signal layers.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n8.3.2.2 Transmitter Reference Resistor\nThe REF0_PCIE and REF1_PCIE terminals connect to an external resistor to set the drive current for the PCI\nExpress TX driver. The recommended resistor value is 14,532 Ω with 1% tolerance.\nA 14,532- Ω resistor is a custom value. To eliminate the need for a custom resistor, two series resistors are\nrecommended: a 14,300- Ω , 1% resistor and a 232- Ω , 1% resistor. Trace lengths must be kept short to\nminimize noise coupling into the reference resistor terminals.\n8.3.2.3 Reference Clock\nThe XIO2001 requires an external reference clock for the PCI-Express interface. The section provide information\nconcerning the requirements for this reference clock. The XIO2001 is designed to meet all stated specifications\nwhen the reference clock input is within all PCI Express operating parameters. This includes both standard clock\noscillator sources or spread spectrum clock oscillator sources.\nThe XIO2001 supports two options for the PCI Express reference clock: a 100-MHz common differential\nreference clock or a 125-MHz asynchronous single-ended reference clock. Both implementations are described\nbelow.\nThe first option is a system-wide, 100-MHz differential reference clock. A single clock source with multiple\ndifferential clock outputs is connected to all PCI Express devices in the system. The differential connection\nbetween the clock source and each PCI Express device is point-topoint. This system implementation is referred\nto as a common clock design.\nThe XIO2001 is optimized for this type of system clock design. The REFCLK+ and REFCLK– pins provide\ndifferential reference clock inputs to the XIO2001. The circuit board routing rules associated with the 100-MHz\ndifferential reference clock are the same as the 2.5-Gb/s TX and RX link routing rules itemized in Section\n8.3.2.1 . The only difference is that the differential reference clock does not require series capacitors. The\nrequirement is a DC connection from the clock driver output to the XIO2001 receiver input.\nTerminating the differential clock signal is circuit board design specific. But, the XIO2001 design has no internal\n50- Ω -to-ground termination resistors. Both REFCLK inputs, at approximately 20 k Ω to ground, are high-\nimpedance inputs.\nThe second option is a 125-MHz asynchronous single-ended reference clock. For this case, the devices at each\nend of the PCI Express link have different clock sources. The XIO2001 has a 125-MHz single-ended reference\nclock option for asynchronous clocking designs. When the REFCLK125_SEL input terminal is tied to V DD_33 , this\nclocking mode is enabled.\nThe single-ended reference clock is attached to the REFCLK+ terminal. The REFCLK+ input, at approximately\n20 k Ω , is a high-impedance input. Any clock termination design must account for a high- impedance input. The\nREFCLK– pin is attached to a 0.1- μ F capacitor. The capacitor’s second pin is connected to V SSA.\n8.3.2.4 Reset\nThe XIO2001 PCI Express reset ( PERST ) terminal connects to the upstream PCI Express device’s PERST\noutput. The PERST  input cell has hysteresis and is operational during both the main power state and V AUX\npower state. No external components are required.\nPlease reference the section to fully understand the PERST  electrical requirements and timing requirements\nassociated with power-up and power-down sequencing. Also, the data manual identifies all configuration and\nmemory-mapped register bits that are reset by PERST.\n8.3.2.5 Beacon\nThe bridge supports the PCI Express in-band beacon feature. Beacon is driven on the upstream PCI Express\nlink by the bridge to request the reapplication of main power when in the L2 link state. To enable the beacon\nfeature, bit 10 (BEACON_ENABLE) in the general control register at offset D4h is asserted. See Section 8.4.66 ,\nGeneral Control Register, for details.\nIf the bridge is in the L2 link state and beacon is enabled, when a secondary PCI bus device asserts PME, then\nthe bridge outputs the beacon signal on the upstream PCI Express link. The beacon signal frequency iswww.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\napproximately 500 kHz ± 50% with a differential peak-to-peak amplitude of 500 mV and no de-emphasis. Once\nthe beacon is activated, the bridge continues to send the beacon signal until main power is restored as indicated\nby PERST going inactive. At this time, the beacon signal is deactivated.\n8.3.2.6 Wake\nPCI Express WAKE is an open-drain output from the XIO2001 that is driven low to re-activate the PCI Express\nlink hierarchy’s main power rails and reference clocks. This PCI Express side-band signal is connected to the\nWAKE  input on the upstream PCIe device. WAKE  is operational during both the main power state and V AUX\npower state.\nSince WAKE is an open-drain output, a system side pullup resistor is required to prevent the signal from floating.\nThe drive capability of this open-drain output is 4 mA. Therefore, the value of the selected pullup resistor must\nbe large enough to assure a logic low signal level at the receiver. A robust system design will select a pullup\nresistor value that de-rates the output driver current capability by a minimum of 50%. At 3.3 V with a de-rated\ndrive current equal to 2 mA, the minimum resistor value is 1.65 k Ω . Larger resistor values are recommended to\nreduce the current drain on the V AUX supply.\n8.3.2.7 Initial Flow Control Credits\nThe bridge flow control credits are initialized using the rules defined in the PCI Express Base Specification . Table\n8-3 identifies the initial flow control credit advertisement for the bridge.\nTable 8-3.

This bridge\nsupports a classic PCI arbiter.\n8.3.3.1 Classic PCI Arbiter\nThe classic PCI arbiter is configured through the classic PCI configuration space at offset DCh. Table 8-5\nidentifies and describes the registers associated with classic PCI arbitration mode.\nTable 8-5. Classic PCI Arbiter Registers\nPCI OFFSET REGISTER NAME DESCRIPTION\nClassic PCI configuration\nregister DChArbiter control\n(see Section 8.4.70 )Contains a two-tier priority scheme for the bridge and six PCI bus devices. The\nbridge defaults to the high priority tier. The six PCI bus devices default to the low\npriority tier. A bus parking control bit (bit 7, PARK) is provided.\nClassic PCI configuration\nregister DDhArbiter request mask\n(see Section 8.4.71 )Six mask bits provide individual control to block each PCI Bus REQ input. Bit 7\n(ARB_TIMEOUT) in the arbiter request mask register enables generating timeout\nstatus if a PCI device does not respond within 16 PCI bus clocks. Bit 6\n(AUTO_MASK) in the arbiter request mask register automatically masks a PCI bus\nREQ if the device does not respond after GNT is issued. The AUTO_MASK bit is\ncleared to disable any automatically generated mask.\nClassic PCI configuration\nregister DEhArbiter time-out status\n(see Section 8.4.72 )When bit 7 (ARB_TIMEOUT) in the arbiter request mask register is asserted, timeout\nstatus for each PCI bus device is reported in this register.\n8.3.4 Configuration Register Translation\nPCI Express configuration register transactions received by the bridge are decoded based on the transaction’s\ndestination ID. These configuration transactions can be broken into three subcategories: type 0 transactions,\ntype 1 transactions that target the secondary bus, and type 1 transactions that target a downstream bus other\nthan the secondary bus.\nPCI Express type 0 configuration register transactions always target the configuration space and are never\npassed on to the secondary interface.\nType 1 configuration register transactions that target a device on the secondary bus are converted to type 0\nconfiguration register transactions on the PCI bus. Figure 8-1  shows the address phase of a type 0 configuration\ntransaction on the PCI bus as defined by the PCI specification.\nFigure 8-1. Type 0 Configuration Transaction Address Phase Encoding\nIn addition, the bridge converts the destination ID device number to one of the AD[31:16] lines as the IDSEL\nsignal. The implemented IDSEL signal mapping is shown in Table 8-6 .www.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nTable 8-6.

The requester ID portion of the PME message uses the stored value in the secondary bus number\nregister as the bus number, 0 as the device number, and 0 as the function number. The Tag field for each PME\nmessage is 00h. A PME message is sent periodically until the PME signal transitions high.\nFigure 8-5  illustrates the format for a PCI Express PME message.\nFigure 8-5.

The PCI bus LOCK  signal is a dedicated output\nthat is enabled by setting bit 12 in the general control register at offset D4h. See Section 8.4.66 , for details.\nNote\nThe use of LOCK is only supported by PCI-Express to PCI Bridges in the downstream direction (away\nfrom the root complex).\nPCI Express locked-memory read request transactions are treated the same as PCI Express memory read\ntransactions except that the bridge returns a completion for a locked-memory read. Also, the bridge uses the PCI\nLOCK protocol when initiating the memory read transaction on the PCI bus.\nWhen a PCI Express locked-memory read request transaction is received and the bridge is not already locked,\nthe bridge arbitrates for use of the LOCK  terminal by asserting REQ . If the bridge receives GNT  and the LOCK\nterminal is high, then the bridge drives the LOCK terminal low after the address phase of the first locked-memory\nread transaction to take ownership of LOCK . The bridge continues to assert LOCK  except during the address\nphase of locked transactions. If the bridge receives GNT  and the LOCK  terminal is low, then the bridge\ndeasserts its REQ and waits until LOCK is high and the bus is idle before re-arbitrating for the use of LOCK.\nData AddressCLK\nFRAME\nLOCK\nAD\nIRDY\nTRDY\nDEVSEL\nFigure 8-6. Starting a Locked Sequence\nOnce the bridge has ownership of LOCK , the bridge initiates the lock read as a memory read transaction on the\nPCI bus. When the target of the locked-memory read returns data, the bridge is considered locked and all\ntransactions not associated with the locked sequence are blocked by the bridge.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nFigure 8-7. Continuing a Locked Sequence\nBecause PCI Express does not have a unique locked-memory write request packet, all PCI Express memory\nwrite requests that are received while the bridge is locked are considered part of the locked sequence and are\ntransmitted to PCI as locked-memory write transactions.\nThe bridge terminates the locked sequence when an unlock message is received from PCI Express and all\nprevious locked transactions have been completed.\nCLK\nFRAME\nLOCK\nIRDY\nFigure 8-8. Terminating a Locked Sequence\nIn the erroneous case that a normal downstream memory read request is received during a locked sequence,\nthe bridge responds with an unsupported request completion status. Note that this condition must never occur,\nbecause the PCI Express Specification  requires the root complex to block normal memory read requests at the\nsource. All locked sequences that end successfully or with an error condition must be immediately followed by\nan unlock message. This unlock message is required to return the bridge to a known unlocked state.\n8.3.8 Two-Wire Serial-Bus Interface\nThe bridge provides a two-wire serial-bus interface to load subsystem identification information and specific\nregister defaults from an external EEPROM. The serial-bus interface signals (SDA and SCL) are shared with two\nof the GPIO terminals (3 and 4). If the serial bus interface is enabled, then the GPIO3 and GPIO4 terminals are\ndisabled. If the serial bus interface is disabled, then the GPIO terminals operate as described in Section 8.3.11 .\n8.3.8.1 Serial-Bus Interface Implementation\nTo enable the serial-bus interface, a pullup resistor must be implemented on the SCL signal. At the rising edge of\nPERST  or GRST , whichever occurs later in time, the SCL terminal is checked for a pullup resistor. If one is\ndetected, then bit 3 (SBDETECT) in the serial-bus control and status register (see Section 8.4.59 ) is set.\nSoftware may disable the serial-bus interface at any time by writing a 0b to the SBDETECT bit. If no external\nEEPROM is required, then the serial-bus interface is permanently disabled by attaching a pulldown resistor to\nthe SCL signal.\nThe bridge implements a two-terminal serial interface with one clock signal (SCL) and one data signal (SDA).\nThe SCL signal is a unidirectional output from the bridge and the SDA signal is bidirectional. Both are open-drainwww.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 35\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nsignals and require pullup resistors. The bridge is a bus master device and drives SCL at approximately 60 kHz\nduring data transfers and places SCL in a high-impedance state (0 frequency) during bus idle states. The serial\nEEPROM is a bus slave device and must acknowledge a slave address equal to A0h. Figure 8-9  illustrates an\nexample application implementing the two-wire serial bus.\nGPIO4 // SCL\nGPIO3 // SDAVDD_33\nA0\nA1\nA2SCL\nSDAXIO2001Serial\nEEPROM\nFigure 8-9. Serial EEPROM Application\n8.3.8.2 Serial-Bus Interface Protocol\nAll data transfers are initiated by the serial-bus master. The beginning of a data transfer is indicated by a start\ncondition, which is signaled when the SDA line transitions to the low state while SCL is in the high state, as\nillustrated in Figure 8-10 . The end of a requested data transfer is indicated by a stop condition, which is signaled\nby a low-to-high transition of SDA while SCL is in the high state, as shown in Figure 8-10 . Data on SDA must\nremain stable during the high state of the SCL signal, as changes on the SDA signal during the high state of\nSCL are interpreted as control signals, that is, a start or stop condition.\nFigure 8-10. Serial-Bus Start/Stop Conditions and Bit Transfers\nData is transferred serially in 8-bit bytes. During a data transfer operation, the exact number of bytes that are\ntransmitted is unlimited. However, each byte must be followed by an acknowledge bit to continue the data\ntransfer operation. An acknowledge (ACK) is indicated by the data byte receiver pulling the SDA signal low, so\nthat it remains low during the high state of the SCL signal. Figure 8-11  illustrates the acknowledge protocol.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nSCL From\nMaster1 2 3 7 8 9\nSDA Output\nBy Transmitter\nSDA Output\nBy ReceiverFigure 8-11. Serial-Bus Protocol Acknowledge\nThe bridge performs three basic serial-bus operations: single byte reads, single byte writes, and multibyte reads.\nThe single byte operations occur under software control. The multibyte read operations are performed by the\nserial EEPROM initialization circuitry immediately after a PCI Express reset. See Section 8.3.8.3 , Serial-Bus\nEEPROM Application , for details on how the bridge automatically loads the subsystem identification and other\nregister defaults from the serial-bus EEPROM.\nFigure 8-12  illustrates a single byte write. The bridge issues a start condition and sends the 7-bit slave device\naddress and the R/W command bit is equal to 0b. A 0b in the R/W command bit indicates that the data transfer\nis a write. The slave device acknowledges if it recognizes the slave address. If no acknowledgment is received\nby the bridge, then bit 1 (SB_ERR) is set in the serial-bus control and status register (PCI offset B3h, see\nSection 8.4.59 ). Next, the EEPROM word address is sent by the bridge, and another slave acknowledgment is\nexpected. Then the bridge delivers the data byte MSB first and expects a final acknowledgment before issuing\nthe stop condition.\nFigure 8-12. Serial-Bus Protocol – Byte Write\nFigure 8-13  illustrates a single byte read. The bridge issues a start condition and sends the 7-bit slave device\naddress and the R/ W command bit is equal to 0b (write). The slave device acknowledges if it recognizes the\nslave address. Next, the EEPROM word address is sent by the bridge, and another slave acknowledgment is\nexpected. Then, the bridge issues a restart condition followed by the 7-bit slave address and the R/ W command\nbit is equal to 1b (read). Once again, the slave device responds with an acknowledge. Next, the slave device\nsends the 8-bit data byte, MSB first. Since this is a 1-byte read, the bridge responds with no acknowledge (logic\nhigh) indicating the last data byte. Finally, the bridge issues a stop condition.\nFigure 8-13.

The serial-bus\nprotocol starts exactly the same as a 1-byte read. The only difference is that multiple data bytes are transferred.\nThe number of transferred data bytes is controlled by the bridge master. After each data byte, the bridge master\nissues acknowledge (logic low) if more data bytes are requested. The transfer ends after a bridge master no\nacknowledge (logic high) followed by a stop condition.\nFigure 8-14. Serial-Bus Protocol – Multibyte Read\nBit 7 (PROT_SEL) in the serial-bus control and status register changes the serial-bus protocol. Each of the three\nprevious serial-bus protocol figures illustrates the PROT_SEL bit default (logic low). When this control bit is\nasserted, the word address and corresponding acknowledge are removed from the serial-bus protocol. This\nfeature allows the system designer a second serial-bus protocol option when selecting external EEPROM\ndevices.\n8.3.8.3 Serial-Bus EEPROM Application\nThe registers and corresponding bits that are loaded through the EEPROM are provided in Table 8-8 .\nTable 8-8.

This slave address is internally\nhardwired and cannot be changed by the system designer. Therefore, all three hardware address bits for the\nEEPROM are tied to V SS to achieve this address. The serial EEPROM in the sample application circuit ( Figure\n8-9) assumes the 1010b high-address nibble. The lower three address bits are terminal inputs to the chip, and\nthe sample application shows these terminal inputs tied to V SS.\nDuring an EEPROM download operation, bit 4 (ROMBUSY) in the serial-bus control and status register is\nasserted. After the download is finished, bit 0 (ROM_ERR) in the serial-bus control and status register may be\nmonitored to verify a successful download.\n8.3.8.4 Accessing Serial-Bus Devices Through Software\nThe bridge provides a programming mechanism to control serial-bus devices through system software. The\nprogramming is accomplished through a doubleword of PCI configuration space at offset B0h. Table 8-9  lists the\nregisters that program a serial-bus device through software.\nTable 8-9.

This register is\nnot used in the quick command protocol.

In\naddition, the protocol-select bit (PROT_SEL) and serial-bus test bit (SBTEST) are programmed\nthrough this register.www.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 39\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nTo access the serial EEPROM through the software interface, the following steps are performed:\n1. The control and status byte is read to verify the EEPROM interface is enabled (SBDETECT asserted) and not\nbusy (REQBUSY and ROMBUSY deasserted).\n2. The serial-bus word address is loaded. If the access is a write, then the data byte is also loaded.\n3. The serial-bus slave address and R/W command selector byte is written.\n4. REQBUSY is monitored until this bit is deasserted.\n5. SB_ERR is checked to verify that the serial-bus operation completed without error. If the operation is a read,\nthen the serial-bus data byte is now valid.\n8.3.9 Advanced Error Reporting Registers\nIn the extended PCI Express configuration space, the bridge supports the advanced error reporting capabilities\nstructure. For the PCI Express interface, both correctable and uncorrectable error statuses are provided. For the\nPCI bus interface, secondary uncorrectable error status is provided. All uncorrectable status bits have\ncorresponding mask and severity control bits. For correctable status bits, only mask bits are provided.\nBoth the primary and secondary interfaces include first error pointer and header log registers. When the first\nerror is detected, the corresponding bit position within the uncorrectable status register is loaded into the first\nerror pointer register. Likewise, the header information associated with the first failing transaction is loaded into\nthe header log. To reset this first error control logic, the corresponding status bit in the uncorrectable status\nregister is cleared by a writeback of 1b.\nFor systems that require high data reliability, ECRC is fully supported on the PCI Express interface. The primary\nside advanced error capabilities and control register has both ECRC generation and checking enable control\nbits. When the checking bit is asserted, all received TLPs are checked for a valid ECRC field. If the generation\nbit is asserted, then all transmitted TLPs contain a valid ECRC field.\n8.3.10 Data Error Forwarding Capability\nThe bridge supports the transfer of data errors in both directions.\nIf a downstream PCI Express transaction with a data payload is received that targets the internal PCI bus and\nthe EP bit is set indicating poisoned data, then the bridge must ensure that this information is transferred to the\nPCI bus. To do this, the bridge forces a parity error on each PCI bus data phase by inverting the parity bit\ncalculated for each double-word of data.\nIf the bridge is the target of a PCI transaction that is forwarded to the PCI Express interface and a data parity\nerror is detected, then this information is passed to the PCI Express interface. To do this, the bridge sets the EP\nbit in the upstream PCI Express header.\n8.3.11 General-Purpose I/O Interface\nUp to five general-purpose input/output (GPIO) terminals are provided for system customization. These GPIO\nterminals are 3.3-V tolerant.\nThe exact number of GPIO terminals varies based on implementing the clock run, power override, and serial\nEEPROM interface features. These features share four of the five GPIO terminals. When any of the three shared\nfunctions are enabled, the associated GPIO terminal is disabled.\nAll five GPIO terminals are individually configurable as either inputs or outputs by writing the corresponding bit in\nthe GPIO control register at offset B4h (See Section 8.4.60 ). A GPIO data register at offset B6h exists to either\nread the logic state of each GPIO input or to set the logic state of each GPIO output. The power-up default state\nfor the GPIO control register is input mode.\n8.3.12 Set Slot Power Limit Functionality\nThe PCI Express Specification  provides a method for devices to limit internal functionality and save power based\non the value programmed into the captured slot power limit scale (CSPLS) and capture slot power limit value\n(CSPLV) fields of the PCI Express device capabilities register at offset 74h. See Section 8.4.50 , Device\nCapabilities Register , for details. The bridge writes these fields when a set slot power limit message is received\non the PCI Express interface.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n40 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nAfter the deassertion of PERST , the XIO2001 compares the information within the CSPLS and CSPLV fields of\nthe device capabilities register to the minimum power scale (MIN_POWER_SCALE) and minimum power value\n(MIN_POWER_VALUE) fields in the general control register at offset D4h. See Section 8.4.66 , General Control\nRegister , for details. If the CSPLS and CSPLV fields are less than the MIN_POWER_SCALE and\nMIN_POWER_VALUE fields, respectively, then the bridge takes the appropriate action that is defined below.\nThe power usage action is programmable within the bridge. The general control register includes a 3-bit\nPOWER_OVRD field. This field is programmable to the following options:\n1. Ignore slot power limit fields.\n2. Assert the PWR_OVRD terminal.\n3. Disable secondary clocks as specified by the clock mask register at offset D9h (see Section 8.4.68 ).\n4. Disable secondary clocks as specified by the clock mask register and assert the PWR_OVRD terminal.\n5. Respond with unsupported request to all transactions except type 0/1 configuration transactions and set slot\npower limit messages\n8.3.13 PCI Express and PCI Bus Power Management\nThe bridge supports both software-directed power management and active state power management through\nstandard PCI configuration space. Software-directed registers are located in the power management capabilities\nstructure located at offset 48h (see Section 8.4.32 ). Active state power management control registers are located\nin the PCI Express capabilities structure located at offset 70h (see Section 8.4.42 ).\nDuring software-directed power management state changes, the bridge initiates link state transitions to L1 or\nL2/L3 after a configuration write transaction places the device in a low power state. The power management\nstate machine is also responsible for gating internal clocks based on the power state. Table 8-10  identifies the\nrelationship between the D-states and bridge clock operation.\nTable 8-10. Clocking In Low Power States\nCLOCK SOURCE D0/L0 D1/L1 D2/L1 D3/L2/L3\nPCI express reference clock input (REFCLK) On On On On/Off\nInternal PCI bus clock to bridge function On Off Off Off\nThe link power management (LPM) state machine manages active state power by monitoring the PCI Express\ntransaction activity. If no transactions are pending and the transmitter has been idle for at least the minimum time\nrequired by the PCI Express Specification , then the LPM state machine transitions the link to either the L0s or L1\nstate. By reading the bridge’s L0s and L1 exit latency in the link capabilities register, the system software may\nmake an informed decision relating to system performance versus power savings. The ASLPMC field in the link\ncontrol register provides an L0s only option, L1 only option, or both L0s and L1 option.\n8.3.14 Auto Pre-Fetch Agent\nThe auto pre-fetch agent is an internal logic module that will generate speculative read requests on behalf of a\nPCI master to improve upstream memory read performance.\nThe auto pre-fetch agent will generate a read thread on the PCI-express bus when it receives an upstream\nprefetchable memory read request on the PCI bus. A read thread is a sequence of one or more read requests\nwith contiguous read addresses. The first read of thread will be started by a master on the PCI bus requesting a\nread that is forwarded to the root complex by the bridge. Each subsequent read in the thread will be initiated by\nthe auto pre-fetch agent. Each subsequent read will use the address that immediately follows the last address of\ndata in the previous read of the thread. Each read request in the thread will be assigned to an upstream request\nprocessor. The pre-fetch agent can issue reads for two threads at one time, alternating between the threads.www.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 41\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n8.4 Register Maps\n8.4.1 Classic PCI Configuration Space\nThe programming model of the XIO2001 PCI-Express to PCI bridge is compliant to the classic PCI-to-PCI bridge\nprogramming model.

The device serves\nas a bridge between an upstream PCIe device and up to six downstream PCI bus devices. The XIO2001\noperates only with the PCIe interface as the primary bus and the PCI bus interface as the secondary bus. The\nPCI bus interface is 32 bits wide and the XIO2001 can be set to provide a PCI clock that operates at 25 MHz, 33\nMHz, 50 MHz, or 66 MHz.\n9.2 Typical Application\n9.2.1 In-Card Implementation\nFigure 9-1. Typical Application\nA common application for the XIO2001 is a PCIe-to-PCI bridge add-in card which implements a peripheral\ncomponent interconnect (PCI) express to PCI bridge circuit using the Texas Instruments XIO2001 PCI Express\nto PCI Bus Translation Bridge. Designed as an ×1 add-in card, it is routed on FR4 as a 8-layer (4 signals, 2\npower, and 2 ground) board with a 100- Ω differential impedance (50- Ω single-ended) using standard routing\nguidelines and requirements.\n9.2.1.1 Design Requirements\n9.2.1.1.1 V CCP Clamping Rail\nThe XIO2001 has a PCI bus I/O clamp rail (PCIR) that can be either 3.3 V or 5 V, depending on the system\nimplementation. For 25-MHz or 33-MHz PCI bus implementations, PCIR may be connected to either 3.3 V or 5.0\nV. For 50-MHz or 66-MHz PCI bus implementations, a 3.3-V connection is the only approved configuration. TheXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n114 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\npower source for this clamp rail is a standard digital supply. The power source for this clamp rail is a standard\ndigital supply. The PCIR terminals should be connected to the digital supply via an inline 1 k Ω resistor. A 0.1- μ\nF decoupling capacitor is also recommended at each PCIR terminal.\nIf PCIR is attached to a 5.0-V supply, the XIO2001 will only output 3.3-V amplitude signals on the PCI bus. The\nreceived PCI bus signal amplitudes may be either 3.3 V or 5.0 V. The PCI bus I/O cells are 5.0-V tolerant and\nthe XIO2001 device is not damaged by 5.0-V input signal amplitudes.\n9.2.1.1.2 Combined Power Outputs\nTo support V AUX system requirements, the XIO2001 internally combines main power with V AUX power. There are\nthree combined power rails in the XIO2001. These three power rails are distributed to the analog circuits, digital\nlogic, and I/O cells that must operate during the V AUX state. Each of the three power rails has an output terminal\nfor the external attachment of bypass capacitors to minimize circuit switching noise. These terminals are named\nVDD_15_COMB , VDD_33_COMB , and V DD_33_COMBIO .\nThe recommended bypass capacitors for each combined output terminal are 1000 pF, 0.01 μF, and 1.0 μF.\nWhen placing these capacitors on the bottom side of the circuit board, the smallest capacitor is positioned next\nto the via associated with the combined output terminal and the largest capacitor is the most distant from the via.\nThe circuit board trace width connecting the combined output terminal via to the capacitors must be at least 12 to\n15 mils wide with the trace length as short as possible.\nOther than the three recommended capacitors, no external components or devices may be attached to these\ncombined output terminals.\n9.2.1.1.3 Auxiliary Power\nIf V AUX power is available in the system, the XIO2001 has the V DD_33_AUX  pin to support this feature. Without\nfully understanding a system’s V AUX power distribution design, recommending external components for the\nXIO2001 is difficult. At a minimum, a 0.1- μF bypass capacitor is placed near the XIO2001 and attached to the\nsystem’s V AUX power supply. A robust design may include a Pi filter with bulk capacitors (5 μF to 100 μF) to\nminimize voltage fluctuations. When the system is cycling main power or is in the V AUX state, the V DD_33_AUX\nterminal requirements are that the input voltage cannot exceed 3.6 V or drop below 3.0 V for proper operation of\nthe bridge.\nIf VAUX power is not present within the system, this terminal is connected to V SS through a resistor with a value\ngreater than 3 k Ω.\n9.2.1.1.4 V SS and V SSA Pins\nFor proper operation of the XIO2001, a unified V SS and V SSA ground plane is recommended. The circuit board\nstack-up recommendation is to implement a layer two ground plane directly under the XIO2001 device. Both the\ncircuit board vias and ground trace widths that connect the V SS and V SSA ball pads to this ground plane must be\noversized to provide a low impedance connection.\n9.2.1.1.5 Capacitor Selection Recommendations\nWhen selecting bypass capacitors for the XIO2001 device, X7R-type capacitors are recommended. The\nfrequency versus impedance curves, quality, stability, and cost of these capacitors make them a logical choice\nfor most computer systems.\nThe selection of bulk capacitors with low-ESR specifications is recommended to minimize low-frequency power\nsupply noise. Today, the best low-ESR bulk capacitors are radial leaded aluminum electrolytic capacitors. These\ncapacitors typically have ESR specifications that are less than 0.01 Ω at 100 kHz. Also, several manufacturers\nsell “ D ” size surface mount specialty polymer solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors with ESR specifications\nslightly higher than 0.01 Ω at 100 kHz. Both of these bulk capacitor options significantly reduce low-frequency\npower supply noise and ripple.www.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 115\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n9.2.1.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n9.2.1.2.1 PCI Bus Interface\nThe XIO2001 has a 32-bit PCI interface that can operate at 25 MHz, 33 MHz, 50 MHz or 66 MHz. This interface\nis compliant with the PCI Local Bus Specification , Revision 2.3 and 3.0. The remainder of this section describes\nimplementation considerations for the XIO2001 secondary PCI bus interface.\n• AD31:0, C/ BE[3:0], PAR, DEVSEL, FRAME, STOP, TRDY, PERR, SERR, and IRDY are required signals\nand must be connected to each PCI bus device. The maximum signal loading specification for a 66 MHz bus\nis 30 pF and for a 33 MHz bus is 50 pF. PCI bus approved pullup resistors connected to V CCP are needed on\nthe following terminals: IRDY, TRDY, FRAME, STOP, PERR, SERR, and DEVSEL.\n• The XIO2001 supports up to six external PCI bus devices with individual CLKOUT, REQ, and GNT signals.\nAn internal PCI bus clock generator function provides six low-skew clock outputs. Plus, there are six REQ\ninputs and six GNT outputs from the internal PCI bus arbiter. Each PCI bus device connects to one CLKOUT\nsignal, one REQ signal, and one GNT signal. All three signals are point-to- point connections. Unused\nCLKOUT signals can be disabled by asserting the appropriate CLOCK_DISABLE bit in the clock control\nregister at offset D8h. Unused REQ signals can be disabled using a weak pullup resistor to V CCP. Unused\nGNT signals are no connects.\n• An external clock feedback feature is provided to de-skew PCI bus clocks. Connecting the CLKOUT[6]\nterminal to the CLK terminal is required if any of the other six CLKOUT[5:0] terminals are used to clock PCI\nbus devices. The CLKOUT signals should be slightly longer than the longest synchronous PCI bus signal\ntrace. Figure 9-2  illustrates the external PCI bus clock feedback feature. The use of series resistors on the\nseven PCI bus clocks should be considered to reduce circuit board EMI.\nNote\nThere is one exception to this length matching rule associated with connecting a CLKOUT signal to\nPCI socket. For this case, the CLKOUT signal connected to a PCI socket should be 2.5 inches\nshorter than the other CLKOUT signals.\nXIO2001VCCPVCCP\nPCI DevicePCI BusM66EN pullup resistor enables\n50/66 MHz by default.\nPulldown used if bus is known\nto be 25/33 M z.

External PCI Bus Clock Configuration\n• The XIO2001 has options providing for four different PCI clock frequencies: 25 MHz, 33 MHz, 50 MHz, and\n66MHz. The clock frequency provided is determined by the states of the M66EN and PCLK66_SEL terminals\nat the de-assertion of PERST.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n116 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n• The PCLK66_SEL terminal determines if the XIO2001 provides either the standard 33/66 MHz frequencies or\n25/50 MHz frequencies. If this terminal is pulled high at the de-assertion of PERST, then CLKOUTx terminals\nprovide the standard PCI 33/66 MHz frequencies (depending on the state of M66EN). If the terminal is pulled\nlow at the de-assertion of PERST, then a 25/50 MHz frequency is provided instead. The determination of\nwhat frequency to use is design-specific, and this terminal must be pulled high or low appropriately.\n• The M66EN terminal determines if the PCI Bus will operate at low speed (50/25 MHz) or high speed (66/33\nMHz). At the de-assertion of PERST, the M66EN terminal is checked and if it is pulled to V CCP, then the high-\nspeed (66 MHz or 50 MHz) frequencies are used. If the pin is low, then the low-speed (33 MHz or 25 MHz)\nfrequencies are used. If the speed of all devices attached to the PCI bus is known, then this terminal can be\npulled appropriately to set the speed of the PCI bus. If add-in card slots are present on a high-speed bus that\nmay have low speed devices attached, then the terminal can be pulled high and connected to the slot,\npermitting the add-in card to pull the terminal low and reduce the bus speed if a low-speed card is inserted.\n• IDSEL for each PCI bus device must be resistively coupled (100 Ω) to one of the address lines between\nAD31 and AD16. Please refer to the XIO2001 Data Manual for the configuration register transaction device\nnumber to AD bit translation chart.\n• PCI interrupts can be routed to the INT[D:A] inputs on the XIO2001. These four inputs are asynchronous to\nthe PCI bus clock and will detect state changes even if the PCI bus clock is stopped. For each INT[D:A] input,\nan approved PCI bus pullup resistor to V CCP is required to keep each interrupt signal from floating. Interrupts\non the XIO2001 that are not connected to any device may be tied together and pulled-up through a single\nresistor.\n•PRST is a required PCI bus signal and must be connected to all devices. This output signal is asynchronous\nto the PCI bus clock. Since the output driver is always enabled and either driving high or low, no pullup\nresistor is needed.\n•LOCK is an optional PCI bus signal. If LOCK is present in a system, it is connected to each PCI bus device\nthat supports the feature and must meet PCI bus loading requirements for the selected clock frequency. An\napproved PCI bus pullup resistor to V CCP is required to keep this signal from floating, even if it is not\nconnected to devices on the bus. LOCK is a bused signal and synchronous to the PCI bus clock. All\nsynchronous PCI bus signals must be length matched to meet clock setup and hold requirements.\n• SERIRQ is an optional PCI bus signal. When PERST is de-asserted, if a pullup resistor to V CCP is detected\non terminal M08, the serial IRQ interface is enabled. A pulldown resistor to V SS disables this feature. If\nSERIRQ is present in a system, it is connected to each PCI bus device that supports the feature and must\nmeet PCI bus loading requirements for the selected clock frequency. An approved PCI bus pullup resistor to\nVCCP is required to keep this signal from floating. SERIRQ is a bused signal and synchronous to the PCI bus\nclock. All synchronous PCI bus signals must be length matched to meet clock setup and hold requirements.\nNote\nSERIRQ does not support serialized PCI interrupts and is used for serializing the 16 ISA interrupts.\n• CLKRUN is an optional PCI bus signal that is shared with the GPIO0 pin. When PERST is de-asserted and if\na pullup resistor to V DD_33  is detected on pin C11 (CLKRUN_EN), the clock run feature is enabled. If\nCLKRUN is required in a system, this pin is connected to each PCI bus device and must meet PCI bus\nloading requirements for the selected clock frequency. An approved PCI bus pullup resistor to V DD_33  is\nrequired per the PCI Mobile Design Guide . CLKRUN is a bused signal and synchronous to the PCI bus\nclock. All synchronous PCI bus signals must be length matched to meet clock setup and hold requirements.\nNote\nIf CLKRUN is used in a system, it must be supported by all devices attached to the PCI bus; if a\ndevice that does not support CLKRUN is attached to a bus where it is enabled, there is a danger\nthat it will not be able to have a clock when it requires one.\n• PWR_OVRD is an optional PCI bus signal that is shared with the GPIO1 terminal. In PWR_OVRD mode, this\npin is always an output and is asynchronous to the PCI bus clock. When the power override control bits in the\ngeneral control register at offset D4h are set to 001b or 011b, the M09 pin operates as the PWR_OVRD\nsignal. Prior to setting the power override control bits, the GPIO1 // PWR_OVRD pin defaults to a standard\nGPIO pin.www.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 117\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n•PME is an optional PCI bus input terminal to detect power management events from downstream devices.\nThe PME terminal is operational during both main power states and V AUX states. The PME receiver has\nhysteresis and expects an asynchronous input signal. The board design requirements associated with this\nPME terminal are the same whether or not the terminal is connected to a downstream device. If the system\nincludes a V AUX supply, the PME terminal requires a weak pullup resistor connected to V AUX to keep the\nterminal from floating. If no V AUX supply is present, the pullup resistor is connected to V DD_33 .\n• The bridge supports external PCI bus clock sources. If an external clock is a system requirement, the\nexternal clock source is connected to the CLK terminal. The trace length relationship between the\nsynchronous bus signals and the external clock signals that is previously described is still required to meet\nPCI bus setup and hold. For external clock mode, all seven CLKOUT[6:0] terminals can be disabled using the\nclock control register at offset D8h. Plus, the XIO2001 clock run feature must be disabled with external PCI\nbus clocks because there is no method of turning off external clocks.\nNote\nIf an external clock with a frequency higher than 33 MHz is used, the M66EN terminal must be\npulled up for the XIO2001 to function correctly.\n• The XIO2001 supports an external PCI bus arbiter. When PERST is deasserted, the logic state of the\nEXT_ARB_EN pin is checked. If an external arbiter is required, EXT_ARB_EN is connected to V DD_33 . When\nconnecting the XIO2001 to an external arbiter, the external arbiter’s REQ signal is connected to the XIO2001\n0 GNT output terminal. Likewise, the GNT signal from the external arbiter is connected to the XIO2001 0\nREQ input pin. Unused REQ signals on the XIO2001 should be tied together and connected to V CCP through\na pull-up resistor. When in external arbiter mode, all internal XIO2001 port arbitration features are disabled.\nFigure 9-3  illustrates the connectivity of an external arbiter.\nXIO2001\nEXT_ARB_EN\nREQ[5:1]GNT0\nREQ0VCCP 3.3 V\nGNTx\nGNTyREQx\nREQyExternal Arbiter\nGNT REQ\nPCI DevicePCI Bus\nFigure 9-3. External Arbiter Connections\n9.2.1.2.1.1 Bus Parking\nBecause of the shared bus nature of PCI, it is required that if the bus is idle at a given time that some device on\nthe bus must drive some signals to stable states. These signals are the address/data lines, the command/byte\nenables, and a valid parity. If no devices are requesting use of the bus, it is the responsibility of the arbiter to\nassign ownership of the bus so that the bus signals are never floating while in idle states.\nIf the XIO2001 internal arbiter is enabled then there are two modes supported for bus parking. The default mode\nfor bus parking is for the arbiter to continue to assert GNT  for the last bus master. In this mode once a device\nhas completed its transaction, the arbiter will continue to assert the GNT  for that bus master and that device is\nrequired to drive a stable pattern onto the required signals. This will continue until another device requests use\nof the bus resulting in the arbiter removing GNT from the current bus owner grants it to the new requestor.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n118 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nAlternatively, the XIO2001 can be configured to self-park. In this mode if no other devices have their REQ\nasserted, the XIO2001 will remove GNT from the current bus owner and drive a stable pattern onto the required\nlines.\nIt is suggested that implementations use the default mode of bus parking. The PCI Specification recommends\nleaving the current GNT  signal asserted if no devices are asserting REQ . Some PCI bus masters will release\ntheir REQ signals after having begun a transaction, even if that transaction may require the use of the bus for an\nextended time. If the XIO2001 self-parks the bus, then these bus masters will have their transaction lengths\nlimited to the latency timer setting. This may result in increased arbitration, higher overhead for transactions, and\ndecreased bus performance.\n9.2.1.2.1.2 I/O Characteristics\nFigure 9-4  shows a 3-state bi-directional buffer that represents the I/O cell design for the PCI bus. Section 6.9,\nElectrical Characteristics over Recommended Operating Conditions , provides the electrical characteristics of the\nPCI bus I/O cell.\nNote\nThe PCI bus interface on the bridge meets the ac specifications of the PCI Local Bus Specification .\nAdditionally, PCI bus terminals (input or I/O) must be held high or low to prevent them from floating.\nPCIR\nFigure 9-4. 3-State Bidirectional Buffer\n9.2.1.2.1.3 Clamping Voltage\nIn the bridge, the PCI bus I/O drivers are powered from the V DD_33  power rail. Plus, the I/O driver cell is tolerant\nto input signals with 5-V peak-to-peak amplitudes.\nFor PCI bus interfaces operating at 50 MHz or 66 MHz, all devices are required to output only 3.3-V peak-to-\npeak signal amplitudes. For PCI bus interfaces operating at 25-MHz or 33-MHz, devices may output either 3.3-V\nor 5-V peak-to-peak signal amplitudes. The bridge accommodates both signal amplitudes.\nEach PCI bus I/O driver cell has a clamping diode connected to the internal V CCP voltage rail that protects the\ncell from excessive input voltage. The internal V CCP rail is connected to two PCIR terminals. If the PCI signaling\nis 3.3-V, then PCIR terminals are connected to a 3.3-V power supply via a 1-k Ω resistor. If the PCI signaling is 5-\nV, then the PCIR terminals are connected to a 5-V power supply via a 1kΩ resistor.\nThe PCI bus signals attached to the V CCP clamping voltage are identified as follows\n•Pin Functions  table, PCI System Terminals, all terminal names except for PME\n•Pin Functions  table, Miscellaneous Terminals, the terminal name SERIRQ.\n9.2.1.2.1.4 PCI Bus Clock Run\nThe bridge supports the clock run protocol as specified in the PCI Mobile Design Guide. When the clock run\nprotocol is enabled, the bridge assumes the role of the central resource master.\nTo enable the clock run function, terminal CLKRUN_EN is asserted high. Then, terminal GPIO0 is enabled as\nthe CLKRUN signal. An external pullup resistor must be provided to prevent the CLKRUN signal from floating To\nverify the operational status of the PCI bus clocks, bit 0 (SEC_CLK_STATUS) in the clock run status register at\noffset DAh (see Section 8.4.69 ) is read.\nSince the bridge has several unique features associated with the PCI bus interface, the system designer must\nconsider the following interdependencies between these features and the CLKRUN feature:www.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 119\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n1. If the system designer chooses to generate the PCI bus clock externally, then the CLKRUN mode of the\nbridge must be disabled. The central resource function within the bridge only operates as a CLKRUN master\nand does not support the CLKRUN slave mode.\n2. If the central resource function has stopped the PCI bus clocks, then the bridge still detects INTx state\nchanges and will generate and send PCI Express messages upstream.\n3. If the serial IRQ interface is enabled and the central resource function has stopped the PCI bus clocks, then\nany PCI bus device that needs to report an IRQ interrupt asserts CLKRUN to start the bus clocks.\n4. When a PCI bus device asserts CLKRUN, the central resource function turns on PCI bus clocks for a\nminimum of 512 cycles.\n5. If the serial IRQ function detects an IRQ interrupt, then the central resource function keeps the PCI bus\nclocks running until the IRQ interrupt is cleared by software.\n6. If the central resource function has stopped the PCI bus clocks and the bridge receives a downstream\ntransaction that is forwarded to the PCI bus interface, then the bridge asserts CLKRUN to start the bus\nclocks.\n7. The central resource function is reset by PCI bus reset ( PRST) assuring that clocks are present during PCI\nbus resets.\n9.2.1.2.1.5 PCI Bus External Arbiter\nThe bridge supports an external arbiter for the PCI bus. Terminal (EXT_ARB_EN), when asserted high, enables\nthe use of an external arbiter.\nWhen an external arbiter is enabled, GNT0  is connected to the external arbiter as the REQ for the bridge.\nLikewise, REQ0 is connected to the external arbiter as the GNT for the bridge.\n9.2.1.2.1.6 MSI Messages Generated from the Serial IRQ Interface\nWhen properly configured, the bridge converts PCI bus serial IRQ interrupts into PCI Express message signaled\ninterrupts (MSI). classic PCI configuration register space is provided to enable this feature. The following list\nidentifies the involved configuration registers:\n1. Command register at offset 04h, bit 2 (MASTER_ENB) is asserted (see Table 8-12 ).\n2. MSI message control register at offset 52h, bits 0 (MSI_EN) and 6:4 (MM_EN) enable single and multiple\nMSI messages, respectively (see Section 8.4.43 ).\n3. MSI message address register at offsets 54h and 58h specifies the message memory address. A nonzero\naddress value in offset 58h initiates 64-bit addressing (see Section 8.4.38  and Section 8.4.45 ).\n4. MSI message data register at offset 5Ch specifies the system interrupt message (see Section 8.4.46 ).\n5. Serial IRQ mode control register at offset E0h specifies the serial IRQ bus format (see Section 8.4.73 ).\n6. Serial IRQ edge control register at offset E2h selects either level or edge mode interrupts (see Section\n8.4.74 ).\n7. Serial IRQ status register at offset E4h reports level mode interrupt status (see Section 8.4.75 ).\nA PCI Express MSI is generated based on the settings in the serial IRQ edge control register. If the system is\nconfigured for edge mode, then an MSI message is sent when the corresponding serial IRQ interface sample\nphase transitions from low to high. If the system is configured for level mode, then an MSI message is sent when\nthe corresponding IRQ status bit in the serial IRQ status register changes from low to high.\nThe bridge has a dedicated SERIRQ terminal for all PCI bus devices that support serialized interrupts. This\nSERIRQ interface is synchronous to the PCI bus clock input (CLK) frequency. The bridge always generates a\n17-phase serial IRQ stream. Internally, the bridge detects only 16 IRQ interrupts, IRQ0 frame through IRQ15\nframe. The IOCHCK frame is not monitored by the serial IRQ state machine and never generates an IRQ\ninterrupt or MSI message.\nThe multiple message enable (MM_EN) field determines the number of unique MSI messages that are sent\nupstream on the PCI Express link. From 1 message to 16 messages, in powers of 2, are selectable. If fewer than\n16 messages are selected, then the mapping from IRQ interrupts to MSI messages is aliased. Table 9-1\nillustrates the IRQ interrupt to MSI message mapping based on the number of enabling messages.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n120 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nTable 9-1.

The system message and message number fields are included in bytes 0 and 1 of the data\npayload.\n9.2.1.2.1.7 PCI Bus Clocks\nThe bridge has seven PCI bus clock outputs and one PCI bus clock input. Up to six PCI bus devices are\nsupported by the bridge.\nTerminal PCLK66_SEL selects the default operating frequency. This signal works in conjunction with terminal\nM66EN to determine the final output frequency. When PCLK66_SEL is asserted high then the clock frequency\nwill be either 66-MHz or 33-MHz depending on the state of M66EN. When M66EN is asserted high then the\nclock frequency will be 66-MHz, when M66EN is de-asserted the clock frequency will be 33-MHz. When\nPCLK66_SEL is de-asserted then the clock frequency will be either 50-MHz or 25-MHz. When M66EN is\nasserted high then the clock frequency will be 50-MHz, when M66EN is de-asserted the clock frequency will be\n25-MHz. The clock control register at offset D8h provides 7 control bits to individually enable or disable each PCI\nbus clock output (see Section 8.4.67 ). The register default is enabled for all 7 outputs.\nThe PCI bus clock (CLK) input provides the clock to the internal PCI bus core and serial IRQ core. When the\ninternal PCI bus clock source is selected, PCI bus clock output 6 (CLKOUT6) is connected to the PCI bus clock\ninput (CLK). When an external PCI bus clock source is selected, the external clock source is connected to the\nPCI bus clock input (CLK). For external clock mode, all seven CLKOUT6:0 terminals must be disabled using the\nclock control register at offset D8h (see Section 8.4.67 ).www.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 121\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n9.2.2 External EEPROM\nFigure 9-5.

In order to make the overall\nlengths of the PCI Clock Signals be the same, a rule has been made, which states that the length of the Clock\nSignal will be fixed to 2.5" on PCI add-in cards. The motherboard design requires that the length of the Clock\nSignal going to the PCI add-in slots will be less by 2.5" in comparison with the other Clock Signals that do not go\nto a PCI add-in slot. With the PCI add-in cards inserted, the Clock Signals lengths match. In a design where\nthere is no add-in slot, the length of the PCI Clock Signals should match. A typical embedded system has all PCI\ndevices on the board itself. In such case, the lengths of clock nets should match.\nThere is no matching requirement on the length of the Address/Data signals with respect to Clock Signal,\nthough, there is a limitation on the maximum length of the Address/Data signal length depending upon the PCI\nBus speed. The length matching of clock signals in PCI bus is not very critical. It is however, often, not too\ndifficult to match it within 100 mils. The PCI Clock Signals should be slightly longer than the longest trace on the\nPCI bus. When 100 mil recommendations become impractical due to board space constraints, this can be\nrelaxed up to a recommended maximum of 250 mils.\nAll 32 bit PCI slots must be placed so the slot can be put on the board as either a 3 V or a 5 V slot. All pins used\nas keying pins (A12, A13, A50, A51, B12,B13, B50, B51) should be put on the board and connected to the GND\nplane. Mounting holes must be placed on either side of the socket.\n(CTXn + TXn) and (CTXp + TXp) are a 100 W differential impedance pair (50 W single ended) and must be\nlength matched to within 5 mils. i.e. CTXp must be within 5 mils of CTXn, TXp must be within 5 mils of TXn, and\n(CTXp + TXp) must be within 5 mils of (CTXn + TXn). The coupling capacitors must be placed as close to the\nPCI Express Edge connector as possible.\nRXp and RXn are a 100 W differential impedance pair (50 W single ended) and must be length matched to\nwithin 5 mils.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n124 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n9.3.2 Layout Example\nFigure 9-9.

The 1.5-V pins are named V DD_15 . These pins supply\npower to the digital core. The 1.5-V core allows for a significant reduction in both power consumption and logicXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n126 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nswitching noise. The 3.3-V pins are named V DD_33  and supply power to most of the input and output cells. Both\nthe V DD_15  and V DD_33  supplies must have 0.1- μF bypass capacitors to VSS (ground) in order for proper\noperation. The recommendation is one capacitor for each power pin. When placing and connecting all bypass\ncapacitors, high-speed board design rules must be followed.\n9.4.2 1.5-V and 3.3-V Analog Supplies\nBoth 1.5-V and 3.3-V analog power is required by the XIO2001. Since circuit noise on the analog power\nterminals must be minimized, a Pi filter is recommended. All VDDA_15 pins must be connected together and\nshare one Pi filter. All V DDA_33  terminals must be connected together and share a second Pi filter.\nBoth the 1.5-V and 3.3-V analog supplies must have 0.1- μF bypass capacitors connected to V SSA (ground) in\norder for proper operation. The recommendation is one capacitor for each power terminal. In addition, one 1000-\npF capacitor per Pi filter is recommended. This 1000-pF capacitor is attached to the device side of the Pi filter\nand to V SSA (ground). High-speed board design rules must be followed when connecting bypass capacitors to\nVDDA and V SSA.\n9.4.3 1.5-V PLL Supply\nThe XIO2001 requires a 1.5-V power supply for the internal PLL (VDDPLL_15). Circuit noise on PLL power must\nbe minimized. A Pi-filter with a 200-mA inductor and 220 Ω @ 100 MHz is recommended for this terminal. The\nPLL power must have a 0.1- μ F bypass capacitor connected to V SS. In addition, a 1000- pF capacitor per Pi-\nfilter is recommended, this 1000-pF capacitor is attached to the device side of the Pi- filter and to V SSA (analog-\nground).\n9.4.4 Power-Up/Down Sequencing\nNote\nThe power sequencing recommendations in this section exclude the V DD_33_AUX  terminal.\nAll XIO2001 analog and digital power pins must be controlled during the power-up and power-down sequence.\nAbsolute maximum power pin ratings must not be exceeded to prevent damaging the device. All power pins\nmust remain within 3.6 V to prevent damaging the XIO2001.\n9.4.5 Power Supply Filtering Recommendations\nTo meet the PCI-Express jitter specifications, low-noise power supplies are required on several of the XIO2001\nvoltage terminals. The power terminals that require low-noise power include V DDA_15  and V DDA_33 . This section\nprovides guidelines for the filter design to create low-noise power sources.\nThe least expensive solution for low-noise power sources is to filter existing 3.3-V and 1.5-V power supplies.\nThis solution requires analysis of the noise frequencies present on the power supplies. The XIO2001 has\nexternal interfaces operating at clock rates of 25 MHz, 33 MHz, 50 MHz, 66 MHz, 100 MHz, 125 MHz, and 2.5\nGHz. Other devices located near the XIO2001 may produce switching noise at different frequencies. Also, the\npower supplies that generate the 3.3 V and 1.5 V power rails may add low frequency ripple noise. Linear\nregulators have feedback loops that typically operate in the 100 kHz range. Switching power supplies typically\nhave operating frequencies in the 500 KHz range. When analyzing power supply noise frequencies, the first,\nthird, and fifth harmonic of every clock source should be considered.\nCritical analog circuits within the XIO2001 must be shielded from this power supply noise. The fundamental\nrequirement for a filter design is to reduce power supply noise to a peak-to-peak amplitude of less than 25 mV.\nThis maximum noise amplitude should apply to all frequencies from 0 Hz to 12.5 GHz.\nThe following information should be considered when designing a power supply filter:\n• Ideally, the series resonance frequency for each filter component should be greater than the fifth harmonic of\nthe maximum clock frequency. With a maximum clock frequency of 1.25 GHz, the third harmonic is 3.75 GHz\nand the fifth harmonic is 6.25 GHz. Finding inductors and capacitors with a series resonance frequency\nabove 6.25 GHz is both difficult and expensive. Components with a series resonance frequency in the 4 to 6\nGHz range are a good compromise.www.ti.comXIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 127\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\n• The inductor(s) associated with the filter must have a DC resistance low enough to pass the required current\nfor the connected power terminals. The voltage drop across the inductor must be low enough to meet the\nminus 10% voltage margin requirement associated with each XIO2001 power terminal. Power supply output\nvoltage variation must be considered as well as voltage drops associated with any connector pins and circuit\nboard power distribution geometries.\n• The Q versus frequency curve associated with the inductor must be appropriate to reduce power terminal\nnoise to less than the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude requirement for the XIO2001. Recommending a\nspecific inductor is difficult because every system design is different and therefore the noise frequencies and\nnoise amplitudes are different. Many factors will influence the inductor selection for the filter design. Power\nsupplies must have adequate input and output filtering. A sufficient number of bulk and bypass capacitors are\nrequired to minimize switching noise. Assuming that board level power is properly filtered and minimal low\nfrequency noise is present, frequencies less than 10 MHz, an inductor with a Q greater than 20 from\napproximately 10 MHz to 3 GHz should be adequate for most system applications.\n• The series component(s) in the filter may either be an inductor or a ferrite bead. Testing has been performed\non both component types. When measuring PCI-Express link jitter, the inductor or ferrite bead solutions\nproduce equal results. When measuring circuit board EMI, the ferrite bead is a superior solution.\nNote\nThe XIO2001 reference schematics include ferrite beads in the analog power supply filters.\n• When designing filters associated with power distribution, the power supply is a low impedance source and\nthe device power terminals are a low impedance load. The best filter for this application is a T filter. See\nFigure 9-12  for a T-filter circuit. Some system may require this type of filter design if the power supplies or\nnearby components are exceptionally noisy. This type of filter design is recommended if a significant amount\nof low frequency noise, frequencies less than 10 MHz, is present in a system.\n• For most applications a Pi filter will be adequate. See Figure 9-12  for a Pi-filter circuit. When implementing a\nPi filter, the two capacitors and the inductor must be located next to each other on the circuit board and must\nbe connected together with wide low impedance traces. Capacitor ground connections must be short and low\nimpedance.\n• If a significant amount of high frequency noise, frequencies greater than 300 MHz, is present in a system,\ncreating an internal circuit board capacitor will help reduce this noise. This is accomplished by locating power\nand ground planes next to each other in the circuit board stackup. A gap of 0.003 mils between the power\nand ground planes will significantly reduce this high frequency noise.\n• Another option for filtering high-frequency logic noise is to create an internal board capacitor using signal\nlayer copper plates. When a component requires a low-noise power supply, usually the Pi filter is located\nnear the component. Directly under the Pi filter, a plate capacitor may be created. In the circuit board stack-\nup, select a signal layer that is physically located next to a ground plane. Then, generate an internal 0.25 inch\nby 0.25 inch plate on that signal layer. Assuming a 0.006 mil gap between the signal layer plate and the\ninternal ground plane, this will generate a 12 pF capacitor. By connecting this plate capacitor to the trace\nbetween the Pi filter and the component’s power pins, an internal circuit board high frequency bypass\ncapacitor is created. This solution is extremely effective for switching frequencies above 300 MHz.\nFigure 9-12  illustrates two different filter designs that may be used with the XIO2001 to provide lownoise power\nto critical power pins.XIO2001\nSCPS212J – MAY 2009 – REVISED JANUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n128 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: XIO2001\nPi-Filter DesignComponent\nSidePower Supply\nSideT-Filter DesignComponent\nSidePower Supply\nSideFigure 9-12.
