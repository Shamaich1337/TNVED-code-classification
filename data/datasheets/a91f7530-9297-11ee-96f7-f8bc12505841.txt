High order curvature compensation allows these references to achieve a low drift of less than 5ppm/°C with a predictable temperature characteristic and \nan output voltage accuracy of ±0.05%. The performance over temperature should appeal to automotive,  high perfor -\nmance industrial and other high temperature applications.\nThe LTC 6652\n voltage references can be powered from \nsupply voltages up to 13.2V. They boast low noise, ex -\ncellent load regulation, source and sink capability and \nexceptional line rejection,\n making them a superior choice \nfor demanding precision applications. A shutdown mode allows power consumption to be reduced when the refer -\nence is not needed. The optional output capacitor can be left off when space constraints are critical .\nThe \nLTC6652 references are offered in an 8-lead MSOP \npackage and an 8-lead LS8 package. The LS8 is a 5mm × 5mm surface mount hermetic package that provides outstanding stability.\nL, LT , LT C , LT M , Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of Linear \nTechnology Corporation.

Exposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetime.\nNote 2: If the parts are stored outside of the specified temperature range, \nthe output may shift due to hysteresis.\nNote 3: Temperature coefficient is measured by dividing the maximum \nchange in output voltage by the specified temperature range.\nNote 4: Load regulation is measured on a pulse basis from no load to the \nspecified load current. Output changes due to die temperature change must be taken into account separately.\nNote 5: Excludes load regulation errors.Note 6: Peak-to-peak noise is measured with a 3-pole highpass at 0.1Hz \nand 4-pole lowpass filter at 10Hz. The unit is enclosed in a still-air environment to eliminate thermocouple effects on the leads. The test time is 10 seconds. RMS noise is measured on a spectrum analyzer in a shielded environment where the intrinsic noise of the instrument is removed to determine the actual noise of the device.Note 7: Long-term stability typically has a logarithmic characteristic and therefore,  changes after 1000 hours tend to be much smaller than before that \ntime. Total drift in the second thousand hours is normally less than one third \nthat of the first thousand hours with a continuing trend toward reduced drift with time.  Long-term stability will also be affected by differential stresses \nbetween the IC and the board material created during board assembly.\nNote 8: Hysteresis in output voltage is created by package stress that \ndiffers depending on whether the IC was previously at a higher or lower temperature.  Output voltage is always measured at 25°C,  but the IC is \ncycled to the hot or cold temperature limit before successive measurements. Hysteresis is roughly proportional to the square of the temperature change. For instruments that are stored at well controlled temperatures ( within 20  \nor 30 degrees of operational temperature)  it’s usually not a dominant error \nsource. Typical hysteresis is the worst-case of 25°C to cold to 25°C or 25°C \nto hot to 25°C,  preconditioned by one thermal cycle.\nNote 9: The stated temperature is typical for soldering of the leads during manual rework.

For applications where an output capaci -\ntor is beneficial, a value of 0.1µF \n to 10µF is recommended \ndepending on load conditions. The Typical Performance Characteristics section includes a plot illustrating a region of marginal stability. Either no or low value capacitors for any load current are acceptable. For loads that sink current or light loads that source current, a 0.1µF to 10µF capacitor has stable operation. For heavier loads that source current a 0.5µF to 10µF capacitor range is recommended.The transient response for a 0.5V step on V\nIN with and \nwithout an output capacitor is shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\nThe LTC6652 references with an output of 2.5V and above \nare guaranteed to source and sink 5mA. The 1.25V and 2.048V versions are guaranteed to source 5mA and sink 1mA. The test circuit for transient load step response is shown in Figure 1. Figures 4 and 5 show a 5mA source and sink load step response without a load capacitor , \nrespectively.\nStart-Up\nThe start-up characteristic of the LTC6652 is shown in \nFigures 8 and 9.

Shutdown Response with 5mA Load\nIn Figure 8, ripple momentarily appears just after the \nleading edge of powering on. This brief one time event is caused by calibration circuitry during initialization. When an output capacitor is used, the ripple is virtually undetect -\nable as shown in Figure 9.\nShutdown Mode\nShutdown mode is enabled by tying SHDN\n low which \nplaces the part in a low power state (i.e., <2µA). In shut -\ndown mode, the output pin takes the value 20k • (rated \noutput voltage). For example, an LTC6652-2.5 will have an output impedance of 20k • 2.5 = 50kΩ. For normal \noperation, SHDN should be greater than or equal to 2.0V. \nFor use with a microcontroller , use a pull-up resistor to \nVIN and an open-drain output driver as shown in Figure \n10. The LTC6652’s response into and out of shutdown \nmode is shown in Figure 11.\nThe trip thresholds on SHDN have some dependence on the \nvoltage applied to V IN as shown in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section. Be careful to avoid leaving SHDN \nat a voltage between the thresholds as this will likely cause an increase in supply current due to shoot-through current.VIN\n2V/DIV\nVOUT\n1V/DIV\n100µs/DIV6652 F08COUT = 0µF\n2.8V ≤ V IN ≤ 13.2V\nVOUT\nTO µCC1\n1µF\nC21µFR120k\n6652 F10L TC6652-2.5\nSHDN\n2N7002VOUTVIN\nGND\nVIN\n2V/DIV\nVOUT\n1V/DIV\n100µs/DIV6652 F09COUT = 1µF\nSHDN\n1V/DIV\nVOUT\n1V/DIV\n1ms/DIV6652 F11ILOAD  = 5mA\nLTC665213\n6652fg For more information www.linear .com/L TC6652applications inForMation\nFigure 12a. MS8 Long-Term Drift\nLong-Term Drift\nLong-term drift cannot be extrapolated from accelerated \nhigh temperature testing.  This erroneous technique gives \ndrift numbers that are wildly optimistic. The only way long-term drift can be determined is to measure it over the time interval of interest. The LTC6652 long-term drift data was collected on more than 100 parts that were sol -\ndered into PC boards similar to a “real world” application. The boards were then placed into a constant temperature oven with \nTA = 35°C, their outputs were scanned regularly \nand measured with an 8.5 digit DVM. Long-term drift is shown below in Figure 12.Figure 12b. LS8 Long-Term Drift \nHysteresis\nThe hysteresis data shown in Figure 13 represents the \nworst-case data collected on parts from –40°C to 125°C. The output is capable of dissipating relatively high power , \ni.e., for the LTC6652-2.5, P\nD = 10.7V • 5.5mA = 58.85mW. \nThe thermal resistance of the MS8 package is 200°C/W and this dissipation causes a 11.8°C internal rise. This could increase the junction temperature above 125°C and may cause the output to shift due to thermal hysteresis. Figure 13a. MS8 Hysteresis Plot \n–40°C to 125°CFigure 13b.

Lead-Free Reflow ProfilePC Board Layout\nThe mechanical stress of soldering a surface mount volt -\nage reference to a PC board can cause the output voltage \nto shift and temperature coefficient to change .\n These two \nchanges are not correlated. For example, the voltage may shift, but the temperature coefficient may not.\nTo reduce the effects of stress-related shifts, mount the \nreference near the short edge of the PC board or in a corner. In addition, slots can be cut into the board on two sides of the device.\nThe capacitors should be mounted close to the package. \nThe GND and V\nOUT traces should be as short as possible \nto minimize I • R drops. Excessive trace resistance directly impacts load regulation.\nIR Reflow Shift\nThe different expansion and contraction rates of the materi -\nals that make up the lead-free LTC6652 package cause the \noutput voltage to shift after undergoing IR reflow . Lead-free \n \nreflow profiles reach over 250°C, considerably more than their leaded counterparts. The lead-free IR reflow profile used to experimentally measure output voltage shift in the LTC6652-2.5 is shown in Figure 14. Similar results can be applications inForMation\nexpected using a convection reflow oven . In our experiment , \nthe serialized parts were run through the reflow process twice. The results indicate that the standard deviation of the output voltage increases with a slight positive mean shift of 0.003% as shown in Figure\n 15.\n While there can \nbe up to 0.016% of output voltage shift, the overall drift of the LTC6652 after IR reflow does not vary significantly.\nPower Dissipation\nPower dissipation in the LTC6652 is dependent on V\nIN, \nload current, and package. The LTC6652 package has \na thermal resistance, or θ JA, of 200°C/W. A curve that \nillustrates allowed power dissipation vs temperature for this package is shown in Figure 16.\nThe power dissipation of the LTC6652-2.5V as a function of input voltage is shown in Figure 17. The top curve \nshows power dissipation with a 5mA load and the bottom curve shows power dissipation with no load.\nWhen operated within its specified limits of V\nIN = 13.2V  \nand sourcing 5 mA, the LTC6652- 2.5 consumes just under \n60mW at room temperature. At 125°C the quiescent cur -\nrent will be slightly higher and the power consumption \nincreases to just over \n60mW. The power-derating curve \nin Figure 16 shows the LTC6652-2.5 can safely dissipate 125mW at 125°C about half the maximum power con\n-\nsumption of the package.\nHumidity Sensitivity\nPlastic mould compounds absorb water. With changes in relative humidity, plastic packaging materials change the amount of pressure they apply to the die inside, which can cause slight changes in the output of a volt -\nage reference, usually on the order of 100ppm. The LS8 package is hermetic ,\n so it is not affected by humidity, and \nis therefore more stable in environments where humidity may be a concern. 0 2 4 6\nMINUTES8075150225300\n6652 F1410120s40stP\n30sTP = 260°C\nRAMP\nDOWN\nRAMP TO\n150°CTS = 190°C\nT = 150°C\ntL\n130sTL = 217°C\nTS(MAX)  = 200°C380s\nLTC665215\n6652fg For more information www.linear .com/L TC6652applications inForMation\nFigure 16.
