The ADP3334 operates\nwith an input voltage range of 2.6 V to 11 V and delivers a\ncontinuous load current up to 500 mA. The novel anyCAP\narchitecture requires only a very small 1 µF output capacitor for\nstability, and the LDO is insensitive to the capacitor’s equivalentseries resistance (ESR). This makes the ADP3334 stable with any\ncapacitor, including ceramic (MLCC) types for space restrictedapplications.\nThe ADP3334 achieves exceptional accuracy of ±0.9% at room\ntemperature and ±1.8% over temperature, line, and load. The\ndropout voltage of the ADP3334 is only 200 mV (typical) at\n500 mA. This device also includes a safety current limit, ther-mal overload protection, and a shutdown feature. In shutdown\nmode, the ground current is reduced to less than 1 µA. The\nADP3334 has low quiescent current of 90 µA (typical) in lightload situations.FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM\nTHERMAL\nPROTECTIONCCIN\nADP3334OUT\nGNDQ1\nBAND GAP\nREFDRIVERgmFB\nSD\nThe ADP3334 is available in three different package options:\n1.Excellent thermal capability, space saving 3 mm /H11003 3 mm LFCSP.\n2.

Output Noise Density\nC\nREV. –6–ADP3334\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nThe new anyCAP LDO ADP3334 uses a single control loop for\nregulation and reference functions. The output voltage is sensed\nby a resistive voltage divider consisting of R1 and R2 that is\nvaried to provide the available output voltage option. Feedback\nis taken from this network by way of a series diode (D1) and asecond resistor divider (R3 and R4) to the input of an amplifier.\nPTAT\nVOSNONINVERTING\nWIDEBAND\nDRIVERINPUT\nQ1\nADP3334COMPENSATION\nCAPACITORATTENUATION\n(VBANDGAP /VOUT)R1\nD1\nR2R3\nR4OUTPUT\nPTATCURRENT(a)CLOAD\nRLOADFB\nGNDgm\nFigure 2. Functional Block Diagram\nA very high gain error amplifier is used to control this loop. The\namplifier is constructed in such a way that equilibrium pro-duces a large, temperature-proportional input, “offset voltage”\nthat is repeatable and very well controlled. The temperature-\npropo rtional offset voltage is combined with the complementary\ndiode voltage to form a “virtual band gap” voltage, implicit in\nthe network although it never appears explicitly in the circuit.\nUltimately, this patented design makes it possible to control\nthe loop with only one amplifier. This technique also improves\nthe noise characteristics of the amplifier by pro viding more\nflexibil ity on the trade-off of noise sources that leads to a low\nnoise design.\nThe R1, R2 divider is chosen in the same ratio as the band gap\nvoltage to the output volt age. Although the R1, R2 resistor divider\nis loaded by the diode D1 and a second divider consisting of R3\nand R4, the values can be chosen to produce a temperature stable\noutput. This unique arrangement specifically corrects for the\nloading of the divider, thus avoiding the error resulting from\nbase current loading in conventional circuits.\nThe patented amplifier controls a new and unique noninverting\ndriver that drives the pass transistor, Q1. The use of this special\nnoninverting driver enables the frequency compensa tion to\ninclude the load capacitor in a pole-splitting arrangement toachieve reduced sensitivity to the value, type, and ESR of the\nload capacitance.\nMost LDOs place very strict requirements on the range of ESR\nvalues for the output capacitor because they are difficult to stabilizedue to the uncertainty of load capacitance and resistance. M ore-\nover, the ESR value, required to keep conventional LDOs stable,\nchanges depending on load and temperature. These ESR limita-\ntions make designing with LDOs more difficult because of their\nunclear specifications and extreme varia tions over temperature.\nWith the ADP3334 anyCAP LDO, this is no longer true. It canbe used with virtually any good quality capacitor, with no con-straint on the minimum ESR. This innovative design allows the\ncircuit to be stable with just a small 1 mF capacitor on the out-\nput. Additional advantages of the pole-splitting scheme includesuperior line noise rejection and very high regulator gain, whichlead to excellent line and load regulation. An impressive ±1.8%\naccuracy is guaranteed over line, load, and temperature.\nAdditional features of the circuit include current limit and ther-\nmal shutdown.\nAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nOutput Capacitor\nAs with any micropower device, output transient response is a\nfunction of the output capacitance. The ADP3334 is stable witha wide range of capacitor values, types, and ESR (anyCAP).\nA capacitor as low as 1 µF is all that is needed for stability;\nlarger capacitors can be used if high output current surges areanticipated. The ADP3334 is stable with extremely low ESR\ncapacitors (ESR /H110150), such as multilayer ceramic capacitors\n(MLCC) or OSCON. Note that the effective capacitance of somecapacitor types may fall below the minimum over the operating\ntemperature range or with the application of a dc voltage.\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nAn input bypass capacitor is not strictly required but is advisable\nin any application involving long input wires or high source\nimpedance. Connecting a 1 µF capacitor from IN to ground\nreduces the circuit’s sensitivity to PC board layout. If a larger\nvalue output capacitor is used, then a larger value input capaci-\ntor is also recommended.\nNoise Reduction Capacitor\nA noise reduction capacitor (C NR) can be placed between the\noutput and the feedback pin to further reduce the noise by\n6dB to 10 dB (TPC 18). Low leakage capacitors in the 100 pF\nto 1 nF range provide the best performance. Since the feedback\npin (FB) is internally connected to a high impedance node, any\nconnection to this node should be carefully done to avoid noise\npickup from external sources. The pad con nected to this pin\nshould be as small as possible, and long PC board traces are not\nrecomm ended.\nWhen adding a noise reduction capacitor, maintain a mini-mum load current of 1 mA when not in shutdown.\nIt is important to note that as C\nNR increases, the turn-on time\nwill be delayed. With C NR values of 1 nF, this delay may be\non the order of several milliseconds.\nCNRADP3334\nOUT\nVIN IN\nGNDVOUT\nONOFFIN\nOUT\nR1\nR2SDCIN\n1/H9262F FBCOUT\n1/H9262F\nFigure 3.

The output voltage will be divided\nby R1 and R2 and then fed back to the FB pin.\nC\nREV. ADP3334\n–7–To have the lowest possible sensitivity of the output voltage to\ntemperature variations, it is important that the value of the parallel\nresistance of R1 and R2 be kept as close as possible to 50 kW.\n    RR\nRRk12\n1250¥\n+=W (1)\nAlso, for the best accuracy over temperature, the feedback volt-\nage should be set for 1.178 V:\n    VVR\nRRFB OUT =¥+Ê\nËÁˆ\n¯˜2\n12(2)\nwhere VOUT is the desired output voltage and VFB is the virtual\nband gap voltage.

To estimate the overall outputvoltage accuracy, it is necessary to take into account all sources\nof error. The accuracy given in the specifications table does not\ntake into account the error introduced by the feedback resistordivider ratio or the error introduced by the parallel combination\nof the feedback resistors.\nThe error in the parallel combination of the feedback resistors\ncauses the reference to have a wider variation over temperature.To estimate the variation , calculate the worst-case error from\n50 k W, and then use the graph in Figure 4 to estimate the\nadditional change in the output voltage over the operatingtemperature range.\nFor example:V\nIN = 5 V\nVOUT = 3.3 V\nR1 = 140 k W, 1%\nR2 = 78.7 k W, 1%Rp ERROR – %OUTPUT ERROR – %3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n023456\nFigure 4.

Under extreme\nconditions (i.e., high ambient temperature and power dissipation)where die temperature starts to rise above 165°C, the output\ncurrent is reduced until the die temperature has dropped to a safe\nlevel. The output current is restored when the die temperatureis reduced.\nC\nREV. –8–ADP3334\nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect\nthe device against accidental overload conditions. For normaloperation, device power dissipation should be externally limited\nso that junction temperatures will not exceed 150°C.\nCalculating Junction Temperature\nDevice power dissipation is calculated as follows:\n  PVV I V IDI NO UT LOAD IN GND =-() +() (8)\nwhere ILOAD and IGND are load current and ground current, VIN\nand VOUT are input and output voltages, respectively.\nAssuming ILOAD = 400  mA, IGND = 4 mA, VIN = 5.0  V and\nVOUT = 2.8 V, device power dissipation is:\n    Pm A m A m WD=-() + () = 52 8 400 5 0 4 900..

Power Derating Curve\nPrinted Circuit Board Layout Consideration\nAll surface-mount packages rely on the traces of the PC board\nto conduct heat away from the package.\nIn standard packages, the dominant component of the heat\nresistance path is the plastic between the die attach pad and theindividual leads. In typical thermally enhanced packages, one or\nmore of the leads are fused to the die attach pad, significantly\ndecreasing this component. To make the improvement mean-ingful, however, a significant copper area on the PCB must be\nattached to these fused pins.As an example, the patented thermal coastline lead frame design\nof the ADP3334 uniformly minimizes the value of the dominantportion of the thermal resistance. It ensures that heat is con-\nducted away by all pins of the package. This yields a very low\n86.6°C/W thermal resistance for the SOIC-8 package, withoutany special board layout requirements, relying only on the normal\ntraces connected to the leads. This yields a 15% improvement in\nheat dissipation capability as compared to a standard SOIC-8package. The thermal resistance can be decreased by an addi-\ntional 10% by attaching a few square centimeters of copper area\nto the IN or OUT pins of the ADP3334 package.\nIt is not recommended to use solder mask or silkscreen on the\nPCB traces adjacent to the ADP3334’s pins since it will increase\nthe junction-to-ambient thermal resistance of the package.\n0.502x VIAS, 0.250\n35µm PLATING\n3.360.901.80\n2.36\n1.901.400.300.73\nFigure 6. 3 mm x 3 mm LFCSP Pad Pattern\n(Dimensions shown in millimeters)\nLFCSP Layout Considerations\nThe LFCSP package has an exposed die paddle on the bottom,which efficiently conducts heat to the PCB. In order to achieve\nthe optimum performance from the LFCSP package, specialconsideration must be given to the layout of the PCB. Use the\nfollowing layout guidelines for the LFCSP package.\n1. The pad pattern is given in Figure 6. The pad dimension\nshould be followed closely for reliable solder joints while\nmaintaining reasonable clearances to prevent solder bridging.\n2. The thermal pad of the LFCSP package provides a low ther-\nmal impedance path (approximately 20°C/W) to the PCB.Therefore the PCB must be properly designed to effectivelyconduct the heat away from the package. This is achieved by\nadding thermal vias to the PCB, which provide a thermal\npath to the inner or bottom layers. See Figure 5 for the rec-ommended via pattern. Note that the via diameter is small to\nprevent the solder from flowing through the via and leaving\nvoids in the thermal pad solder joint.\nNote that the thermal pad is attached to the die substrate, so\nthe thermal planes that the vias attach the package to must\nbe electrically isolated or connected to V\nIN. Do NOT con-\nnect the thermal pad to ground.\nC\nREV. ADP3334\n–9–3. The solder mask opening should be about 120 microns\n(4.7 mils) larger than the pad size resulting in a minimum\n60 micron (2.4 mils) clearance between the pad and the\nsolder mask.\n4. The paste mask opening is typically designed to match the\npad size used on the peripheral pads of the LFCSP package.\nThis should provide a reliable solder joint as long as the\nstencil thickness is about 0.125 mm.\nThe paste mask for the thermal pad needs to be designed for\nthe maximum coverage to effectively remove the heat from thepackage. However, due to the presence of thermal vias and the\nsize of the thermal pad, eliminating voids may not be possible.\n5. The recommended paste mask stencil thickness is 0.125 mm.\nA laser cut stainless steel stencil with trapezoidal walls should\nbe used.\nA “No Clean” Type 3 solder paste should be used for m ount-\ning the LFCSP package. Also, a nitrogen purge during the\nreflow process is recommended.\n6. The package manufacturer recommends that the reflow\ntemperature should not exceed 220°C and the time above\nliquidus is less than 75 seconds. The preheat ramp should be\n3°C/second or lower. The actual temperature profile dependson the board density and must determined by the assembly\nhouse as to what works best.Use the following general guidelines when designing printed\ncircuit boards.\n1. Keep the output capacitor as close as possible to the out-\nput and ground pins.\n2. Keep the input capacitor as close as possible to the input\nand ground pins.\n3. PC board traces with larger cross sectional areas will remove\nmore heat from the ADP3334. For optimum heat transfer,\nspecify thick copper and use wide traces.\n4. Use additional copper layers or planes to reduce the\nthermal resistance. When connecting to other layers, usemultiple vias if possible.\nShutdown Mode\nApplying a TTL high signal to the shutdown (SD) pin or the\ninput pin will turn the output off. Pulling SD down to 0.4 V or\nbelow or tying it to ground will turn the output on. In shutdownmode, quiescent current is reduced to much less than 1 µA.\nC\nADP3334 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
