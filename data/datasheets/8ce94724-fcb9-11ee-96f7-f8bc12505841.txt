Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\n5 Description (Continued)\nThe TLV320AIC3104 contains four high-power output drivers as well as two fully differential output drivers. The\nhigh-power output drivers can drive a variety of load configurations, including up to four channels of single-\nended 16- Ω headphones using AC-coupling capacitors, or stereo 16- Ω headphones in a capacitor-free output\nconfiguration.\nThe stereo audio DAC supports sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz and includes programmable digital filtering\nin the DAC path for 3D, bass, treble, midrange effects, speaker equalization, and de-emphasis for 32-kHz,\n44.1-kHz, and 48-kHz sample rates. The stereo audio ADC supports sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz and is\npreceded by programmable gain amplifiers or AGC that can provide up to 59.5-dB analog gain for low-level\nmicrophone inputs. The TLV320AIC3104 provides an extremely high range of programmability for both attack\n(8–1,408 ms) and for decay (0.05–22.4 seconds). This extended AGC range allows the AGC to be tuned for\nmany types of applications.\nFor battery-saving applications where neither analog nor digital signal processing are required, the device can\nbe put in a special analog signal passthrough mode. This mode significantly reduces power consumption, as\nmost of the device is powered down during this passthrough operation.\nThe serial control bus supports the I2C protocol, whereas the serial audio data bus is programmable for I2S, left-\nand right-justified, DSP, or TDM modes. A highly programmable PLL is included for flexible clock generation and\nsupport for all standard audio rates from a wide range of available MCLKs, varying from 512 kHz to 50 MHz, with\nspecial attention paid to the most-popular cases of 12-MHz, 13-MHz, 16-MHz, 19.2-MHz, and 19.68-MHz\nsystem clocks.\nThe TLV320AIC3104 operates from an analog supply of 2.7 V to 3.6 V, a digital core supply of 1.525 V to 1.95 V,\nand a digital I/O supply of 1.1 V to 3.6 V. The device is available in a 5-mm × 5-mm 32-pin VQFN package.\n6 Device Comparison Table\nDEVICE NAME DESCRIPTION\nTLV320AIC3104 Low-power stereo CODEC with 6 inputs, 6 outputs, HP amplifier and enhanced digital effects\nTLV320AIC3101 Same as TLV320AIC3104, but with speaker and HP amplifier\nTLV320AIC3105 Same as TLV320AIC3104, but with all inputs single-ended\nTLV320AIC3106 Same as TLV320AIC3104, but with 10 inputs and 7 outputs\nTLV320AIC3107 Same as TLV320AIC3104, but with 7 inputs, 6 outputs and integrated mono class-D amplifier\nTLV320AIC3109-Q1 Same as TLV320AIC3104, but AEC-Q100 qualified with 2 inputs, 6 outputs, and mono ADC and DACTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\n7 Pin Configuration and Functions\nP0048-01SDA DVDD\nDRVDDMCLK\n1\n242\n233\n224\n215\n206\n197\n188\n179 32\n10 31\n11 30\n12 29\n13 28\n14 27\n15 26\n16 25MIC1LP/LINE1LPBCLK\nMIC1LM/LINE1LMWCLK\nMIC1RP/LINE1RPDIN\nMIC1RM/LINE1RMDOUT\nMIC2L/LINE2L/MICDETDVSS\nMICBIASIOVDD\nMIC2R/LINE2RSCL\nRESET\nHPROUTRIGHT_LOM\nHPRCOMRIGHT_LOP\nDRVSSLEFT_LOM\nHPLCOMLEFT_LOP\nHPLOUTAVSS2\nDRVDDAVDD\nAVSS1\nNOTE: Connect device thermal pad to DRVSS.\nFigure 7-1.

In cases where changes are needed only to routing or volume-control registers,\nthe changes should be accomplished by writing directly to the appropriate registers rather than using the\nsoftware or hardware reset.\nIn cases where the ESD events generate a device reset, it is recommended to add at least a 1-nF capacitor\nconnected between the RESET pin and DVSS. This capacitor avoids ESD events that could place the codec in\ndefault state.\n10.3.2 Digital Audio Data Serial Interface\nAudio data is transferred between the host processor and the TLV320AIC3104 via the digital audio data serial\ninterface. The audio bus of the TLV320AIC3104 can be configured for left- or right-justified, I2S, DSP, or TDM\nmodes of operation, where communication with standard telephony PCM interfaces is supported within the TDM\nmode. These modes are all MSB-first, with data width programmable as 16, 20, 24, or 32 bits. In addition, the\nword clock (WCLK) and bit clock (BCLK) can be independently configured in either master or slave mode, for\nflexible connectivity to a wide variety of processors.\nThe word clock (WCLK) is used to define the beginning of a frame, and may be programmed as either a pulse or\na square-wave signal. The frequency of this clock corresponds to the selected ADC and DAC sampling\nfrequency.\nThe bit clock (BCLK) is used to clock in and out the digital audio data across the serial bus. When in master\nmode, this signal can be programmed in two further modes: continuous transfer mode, and 256-clock mode. In\ncontinuous transfer mode, only the minimal number of bit clocks needed to transfer the audio data are\ngenerated, so in general the number of bit clocks per frame is two times the data width. For example, if data\nwidth is chosen as 16 bits, then 32 bit clocks are generated per frame. If the bit clock signal in master mode is to\nbe used by a PLL in another device, it is recommended that the 16-bit or 32-bit data-width selections be used.\nThese cases result in a low-jitter bit clock signal being generated, having frequencies of 32 f S or 64 f S. In the\ncases of 20-bit and 24-bit data width in master mode, the bit clocks generated in each frame are not all of equal\nperiod, due to the device not having a clean 40-f S or 48-f S clock signal readily available. The average frequency\nof the bit clock signal is still accurate in these cases (being 40 f S or 48 f S), but the resulting clock signal has\nhigher jitter than in the 16-bit and 32-bit cases.\nIn 256-clock mode, a constant 256 bit clocks per frame are generated, independent of the data width chosen.\nThe TLV320AIC3104 further includes programmability to place the DOUT line in the high-impedance state during\nall bit clocks when valid data is not being sent. By combining this capability with the ability to program at what bit\nclock in a frame the audio data begins, time-division multiplexing (TDM) can be accomplished, resulting in\nmultiple codecs able to use a single audio serial data bus.\nWhen the digital audio data serial interface is powered down while configured in master mode, the pins\nassociated with the interface are put into a high-impedance state.TLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\n10.3.2.1 Right-Justified Mode\nIn right-justified mode, the LSB of the left channel is valid on the rising edge of the bit clock preceding the falling\nedge of word clock.

For incoming data, the codec simply ignores\ndata on the bus except where it is expected, based on the programmed offset.\nNote that the location of the data when an offset is programmed is different, depending on what transfer mode is\nselected. In DSP mode, both left and right channels of data are transferred immediately adjacent to each other in\nthe frame. This differs from left-justified mode, where the left- and right-channel data are always a half-frame\napart in each frame. In this case, as the offset is programmed from zero to some higher value, both the left- and\nright-channel data move across the frame, but still stay a full half-frame apart from each other.

The converters also can operate at\ndifferent sampling rates in various combinations, which are described further as follows.\nThe data converters are based on the concept of an f S(ref) rate that is used internal to the part, and it is related to\nthe actual sampling rates of the converters through a series of ratios. For typical sampling rates, f S(ref) is either\n44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, although it can realistically be set over a wider range of rates up to 53 kHz, with additional\nrestrictions applying if the PLL is used. This concept is used to set the sampling rates of the ADC and DAC, and\nalso to enable high-quality playback of low-sampling-rate data, without high-frequency audible noise being\ngenerated.\nThe sampling rate of the ADC and DAC can be set to f S(ref) / NCODEC or 2 × f S(ref) / NCODEC, with NCODEC\nbeing 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, or 6 for both the NDAC and NADC settings. In the TLV320AIC3104,\nNDAC and NADC must be set to the same value, as the device only supports a common sample rate for the\nADC and DAC channels. Therefore NCODEC = NDAC = NADC, and this is programmed by setting the value of\nbits D7–D4 equal to the value of bits D3–D0 in register 2, on page 0.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\n10.3.3.1 Audio Clock Generation\nThe audio converters in the TLV320AIC3104 need an internal audio master clock at a frequency of 256 f S(ref),\nwhich can be obtained in a variety of manners from an external clock signal applied to the device.\nA more detailed diagram of the audio clock section of the TLV320AIC3104 is shown in Figure 10-8 .\nK*R/P 2/QPLL_CLKIN\nCODECCODEC_CLKINPLL_OUTQ□=□2,□3,….., 16,□17MCLK BCLK\nCLKDIV_IN PLL_IN\nB0153-01DAC fS ADC fSCODEC_CLK□=□256 f /c180S(ref)CLKDIV_OUT\n1/8\nPLLDIV_OUTCLKDIV_CLKIN\nK□=□J.D\nJ□=□1,□2,□3,□....,□62,□63\nD□=□0000,□0001,□....,□9998,□9999\nR□=□1,□2,□3,□4,□....,□15,□16\nP =□1,□2,□....,□7,□8\nWCLK□= /NCODEC\nCODEC =□DAC = ADC\nSet□NCODEC□=□NADC□=□NDAC□=□1,□1.5,□2,□....,□5.5,□6\nDAC□DRA =>□NDAC□=□0.5\nADC□DRA =>□NADC□=□0.5f\nf f fS(ref)\nS S S\nFigure 10-8.

The ADC supports sampling rates from\n8 kHz to 48 kHz in single-rate mode, and up to 96 kHz in dual-rate mode. Whenever the ADC or DAC is in\noperation, the device requires that an audio master clock be provided and appropriate audio clock generation be\nset up within the device.\nIn order to provide optimal system power dissipation, the stereo ADC can be powered one channel at a time, to\nsupport the case where only mono record capability is required. In addition, both channels can be fully powered\nor entirely powered down.\nThe integrated digital decimation filter removes high-frequency content and downsamples the audio data from an\ninitial sampling rate of 128 f S to the final output sampling rate of f S. The decimation filter provides a linear phase\noutput response with a group delay of 17 / f S. The –3-dB bandwidth of the decimation filter extends to 0.45 f S\nand scales with the sample rate (f S). The filter has minimum 75-dB attenuation over the stop band from 0.55 f S to\n64 f S. Independent digital high-pass filters are also included with each ADC channel, with a corner frequency\nthat can be independently set.TLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nBecause of the oversampling nature of the audio ADC and the integrated digital decimation filtering,\nrequirements for analog antialiasing filtering are very relaxed. The TLV320AIC3104 integrates a second-order\nanalog antialiasing filter with 20-dB attenuation at 1 MHz. This filter, combined with the digital decimation filter,\nprovides sufficient antialiasing filtering without requiring additional external components.\nThe ADC is preceded by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), which allows analog gain control from 0 dB to\n59.5 dB in steps of 0.5 dB. The PGA gain changes are implemented with an internal soft-stepping algorithm that\nonly changes the actual volume level by one 0.5-dB step every one or two ADC output samples, depending on\nthe register programming (see page 0, registers 19 and 22). This soft-stepping ensures that volume control\nchanges occur smoothly with no audible artifacts. On reset, the PGA gain defaults to a mute condition, and on\npower down, the PGA soft-steps the volume to mute before shutting down. A read-only flag is set whenever the\ngain applied by PGA equals the desired value set by the register. The soft-stepping control can also be disabled\nby programming a register bit. When soft stepping is enabled, the audio master clock must be applied to the part\nafter the ADC power-down register is written to ensure the soft-stepping to mute has completed. When the ADC\npower-down flag is no longer set, the audio master clock can be shut down.\n10.3.3.2.1 Stereo Audio ADC High-Pass Filter\nOften in audio applications it is desirable to remove the dc offset from the converted audio data stream. The\nTLV320AIC3104 has a programmable first-order high-pass filter which can be used for this purpose. The digital\nfilter coefficients are in 16-bit format and therefore use two 8-bit registers for each of the three coefficients, N0,\nN1, and D1. The transfer function of the digital high-pass filter is of the form:\nH(z)/C0043N0/C0041N1/C0032z/C00421\n32, 768/C0042D1/C0032z/C00421\n(3)\nProgramming the left channel is done by writing to page 1, registers 65–70, and the right channel is programmed\nby writing to page 1, registers 71–76. After the coefficients have been loaded, these ADC high-pass filter\ncoefficients can be selected by writing to page 0, register 107, bits D7–D6, and the high-pass filter can be\nenabled by writing to page 0, register 12, bits D7–D4.\n10.3.3.2.2 Automatic Gain Control (AGC)\nAn automatic gain control (AGC) circuit is included with the ADC and can be used to maintain nominally constant\noutput signal amplitude when recording speech signals (it can be fully disabled if not desired). This circuitry\nautomatically adjusts the PGA gain as the input signal becomes overly loud or very weak, such as when a\nperson speaking into a microphone moves closer or farther from the microphone. The AGC algorithm has\nseveral programmable settings, including target level, attack and decay time constants, noise threshold, and\nmaximum PGA gain applicable, that allow the algorithm to be fine-tuned for any particular application. These\nAGC features are explained in following paragraphs, and their operation is illustrated in Figure 10-9 .The\nalgorithm uses the absolute average of the signal (which is the average of the absolute value of the signal) as a\nmeasure of the nominal amplitude of the output signal.\nNote that completely independent AGC circuitry is included with each ADC channel with entirely independent\ncontrol over the algorithm from one channel to the next. This is attractive in cases where two microphones are\nused in a system, but may have different placement in the end equipment and require different dynamic\nperformance for optimal system operation.\n10.3.3.2.2.1 Target Level\nRepresents the nominal output level at which the AGC attempts to hold the ADC output signal level. The\nTLV320AIC3104 allows programming of eight different target levels, which can be programmed from –5.5 dB to\n–24 dB relative to a full-scale signal. Because the device reacts to the signal absolute average and not to peak\nlevels, it is recommended that the target level be set with enough margin to avoid clipping at the occurrence of\nloud sounds.\n10.3.3.2.2.2 Attack Time\nDetermines how quickly the AGC circuitry reduces the PGA gain when the input signal is too loud. It can be\nvaried from 7 ms to 1,408 ms. The extended right-channel attack time can be programmed by writing to page 0,\nregister 103, and the left channel is programmed by writing to page 0, register 105.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\n10.3.3.2.2.3 Decay Time\nDetermines how quickly the PGA gain is increased when the input signal is too low. It can be varied in the range\nfrom 0.05 s to 22.4 s. The extended right-channel decay time can be programmed by writing to page 0, register\n104, and the left channel is programmed by writing to page 0, register 106.\nThe actual AGC decay time maximum is based on a counter length, so the maximum decay time scales with the\nclock setup that is used. Table 10-2  shows the relationship of the NCODEC ratio to the maximum time available\nfor the AGC decay. In practice, these maximum times are extremely long for audio applications and should not\nlimit any practical AGC decay time that is needed by the system.\nTable 10-2.

This\nensures that noise does not get gained up in the absence of speech. Noise threshold level in the AGC algorithm\nis programmable from –30 dB to –90 dB relative to full scale. A disable noise gate feature is also available. This\noperation includes programmable debounce and hysteresis functionality to avoid the AGC gain from cycling\nbetween high gain and 0 dB when signals are near the noise threshold level.

Typical Operation of the AGC Algorithm During Speech Recording\nThe time constants here are correct when the ADC is not in double-rate audio mode. The time constants are\nachieved using the f S(ref) value programmed in the control registers. However, if the f S(ref) is set in the registers\nto, for example, 48 kHz, but the actual audio clock or PLL programming actually results in a different f S(ref) in\npractice, then the time constants would not be correct.\nThe actual AGC decay time maximum is based on a counter length, so the maximum decay time scales with the\nclock setup that is used. Table 10-2  shows the relationship of the NCODEC ratio to the maximum time available\nfor the AGC decay. In practice, these maximum times are extremely long for audio applications and should not\nlimit any practical AGC decay time that is needed by the system.\n10.3.4 Stereo Audio DAC\nThe TLV320AIC3104 includes a stereo audio DAC supporting sampling rates from 8 kHz to 96 kHz. Each\nchannel of the stereo audio DAC consists of a digital audio processing block, a digital interpolation filter, multi-bit\ndigital delta-sigma modulator, and an analog reconstruction filter. The DAC is designed to provide enhanced\nperformance at low sampling rates through increased oversampling and image filtering, thereby keeping\nquantization noise generated within the delta-sigma modulator and signal images strongly suppressed within the\naudio band to beyond 20 kHz. This is realized by keeping the upsampled rate constant at 128 f S(ref) and\nchanging the oversampling ratio as the input sample rate is changed. For an f S(ref) of 48 kHz, the digital delta-\nsigma modulator always operates at a rate of 6.144 MHz. This ensures that quantization noise generated within\nthe delta-sigma modulator stays low within the frequency band below 20 kHz at all sample rates. Similarly, for an\nfS(ref) rate of 44.1 kHz, the digital delta-sigma modulator always operates at a rate of 5.6448 MHz.\nThe following restrictions apply in the case when the PLL is powered down and double-rate audio mode is\nenabled in the DAC.\nAllowed Q values = 4, 8, 9, 12, 16\nQ values where equivalent f S(ref) can be achieved by turning on PLL\nQ = 5, 6, 7 (set P = 5, 6, 7 and K = 16 and PLL enabled)\nQ = 10, 14 (set P = 5, 7 and K = 8 and PLL enabled)www.ti.comTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\n10.3.4.1 Digital Audio Processing for Playback\nThe DAC channel consists of optional filters for de-emphasis and bass, treble, midrange level adjustment,\nspeaker equalization, and 3-D effects processing. The de-emphasis function is implemented by a programmable\ndigital filter block with fully programmable coefficients (see page 1, registers 21–26 for the left channel and page\n1, registers 47–52 for the right channel). If de-emphasis is not required in a particular application, this\nprogrammable filter block can be used for some other purpose. The de-emphasis filter transfer function is given\nby:\nH(z)/C0043N0/C0041N1/C0032z/C00421\n32, 768/C0042D1/C0032z/C00421\n(4)\nwhere the N0, N1, and D1 coefficients are fully programmable individually for each channel. The coefficients that\nshould be loaded to implement standard de-emphasis filters are given in Table 10-3 .\nTable 10-3.

This filter is implemented as cascade of two biquad\nsections with frequency response given by:\n/C0466N0/C00412/C0032N1/C0032z/C00421/C0041N2/C0032z/C00422\n32, 768 /C00422/C0032D1/C0032z/C00421/C0042D2/C0032z/C00422/C0467/C0466N3/C00412/C0032N4/C0032z/C00421/C0041N5/C0032z/C00422\n32, 768 /C00422/C0032D4/C0032z/C00421/C0042D5/C0032z/C00422/C0467\n(5)\nThe N and D coefficients are fully programmable, and the entire filter can be enabled or bypassed. The structure\nof the filtering when configured for independent channel processing is shown in Figure 10-10 , with LB1\ncorresponding to the first left-channel biquad filter using coefficients N0, N1, N2, D1, and D2. LB2 similarly\ncorresponds to the second left-channel biquad filter using coefficients N3, N4, N5, D4, and D5.

The N and D\ncoefficients are represented by 16-bit, 2s-complement numbers with values ranging from –32,768 to 32,767.\nTable 10-4.

The architecture of this processing mode, and the programmable filters available for use in the\nsystem, are shown in Figure 10-11 . Note that the programmable attenuation block provides a method of\nadjusting the level of 3-D effect introduced into the final stereo output. This, combined with the fully\nprogrammable biquad filters in the system, enables the user to optimize the audio effects for a particular system\nand provide extensive differentiation from other systems using the same device.\nB0155-01LB1\nRB2AttenLB2 L\n++\n+++\n– –+\n+RTo□Left□Channel\nTo□Right□Channel\nFigure 10-11. Architecture of the Digital Audio Processing When 3-D Effects Are Enabled\nIt is recommended that the digital effects filters should be disabled while the filter coefficients are being modified.\nWhile new coefficients are being written to the device over the control port, it is possible that a filter using\npartially updated coefficients may actually implement an unstable system and lead to oscillation or objectionable\naudio output. By disabling the filters, changing the coefficients, and then re-enabling the filters, these types of\neffects can be entirely avoided.\n10.3.4.2 Digital Interpolation Filter\nThe digital interpolation filter upsamples the output of the digital audio processing block by the required\noversampling ratio before data is provided to the digital delta-sigma modulator and analog reconstruction filter\nstages. The filter provides a linear phase output with a group delay of 21 / f S. In addition, programmable digital\ninterpolation filtering is included to provide enhanced image filtering and reduce signal images caused by the\nupsampling process that are below 20 kHz. For example, upsampling an 8-kHz signal produces signal images at\nmultiples of 8-kHz (i.e., 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 24 kHz, etc.). The images at 8 kHz and 16 kHz are below 20 kHz and still\naudible to the listener; therefore, they must be filtered heavily to maintain a good quality output. The interpolation\nfilter is designed to maintain at least 65-dB rejection of images which are below 7.455 f S. In order to use the\nprogrammable interpolation capability, f S(ref) should be programmed to a higher rate (restricted to be in the range\nof 39 kHz to 53 kHz when the PLL is in use), and the actual f S is set using the NCODEC divider, where\nNCODEC = NDAC = NADC. For example, if f S = 8 kHz is required, then f S(ref) can be set to 48 kHz, and the DACwww.ti.comTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 33\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nfS set to f S(ref) / 6. This ensures that all images of the 8-kHz data are sufficiently attenuated well beyond a 20-kHz\naudible frequency range.\n10.3.4.3 Delta-Sigma Audio DAC\nThe stereo audio DAC incorporates a third-order multi-bit delta-sigma modulator followed by an analog\nreconstruction filter. The DAC provides high-resolution, low-noise performance, using oversampling and noise\nshaping techniques. The analog reconstruction filter design consists of a six-tap analog FIR filter followed by a\ncontinuous-time RC filter. The analog FIR operates at a rate of 128 f S(ref) (6.144 MHz when f S(ref) = 48 kHz,\n5.6448 MHz when f S(ref) = 44.1 kHz). Note that the DAC analog performance may be degraded by excessive\nclock jitter on the MCLK input. Therefore, care must be taken to keep jitter on this clock to a minimum.\n10.3.4.4 Audio DAC Digital Volume Control\nThe audio DAC includes a digital volume control block which implements a programmable digital gain. The\nvolume level can be varied from 0 dB to –63.5 dB in 0.5-dB steps, or set to mute, independently for each\nchannel. The volume level of both channels can also be changed simultaneously by the master volume control.\nGain changes are implemented with a soft-stepping algorithm, which only changes the actual volume by one\nstep per input sample, either up or down, until the desired volume is reached. The rate of soft-stepping can be\nslowed to one step per two input samples through a register bit.\nBecause of soft-stepping, the host does not know when the DAC has been actually muted. This may be\nimportant if the host wishes to mute the DAC before making a significant change, such as changing sample\nrates. In order to help with this situation, the device provides a flag back to the host via a read-only register bit\nthat alerts the host when the part has completed the soft-stepping and the actual volume has reached the\ndesired volume level. The soft-stepping feature can be disabled through register programming. If soft-stepping is\nenabled, the MCLK signal should be kept applied to the device until the DAC power-down flag is set. When this\nflag is set, the internal soft-stepping process and power-down sequence is complete, and the MCLK can then be\nstopped if desired.\nThe TLV320AIC3104 also includes functionality to detect when the user changes the selection of de-emphasis or\ndigital audio processing functionality. When the new selection is detected, the TLV320AIC3104 (1) soft-mutes\nthe DAC volume control, (2) changes the operation of the digital effects processing to match the new selection,\nand (3) soft-unmutes the device. This avoids any possible pop or clicks in the audio output due to instantaneous\nchanges in the filtering. A similar algorithm is used when first powering up or powering down the DAC. The\ncircuit begins operation at power up with the volume control muted, then soft-steps it up to the desired volume\nlevel. At power down, the logic first soft-steps the volume down to a mute level, then powers down the circuitry.\n10.3.4.5 Increasing DAC Dynamic Range\nThe TLV320AIC3104 allows trading off dynamic range with power consumption. The DAC dynamic range can be\nincreased by writing to page 0, register 109, bits D7–D6. The lowest DAC current setting is the default, and the\ndynamic range is displayed in the AUDIO DAC – Differential Line Output section of the Electrical Characteristics\ntable. Increasing the current can increase the DAC dynamic range by up to 1.5 dB.\n10.3.4.6 Analog Output Common-Mode Adjustment\nThe output common-mode voltage and output range of the analog output are determined by an internal band-\ngap reference, in contrast to other codecs that may use a scaled version of the analog supply. This scheme is\nused to reduce the coupling of noise that may be on the supply (such as 217-Hz noise in a GSM cellphone) into\nthe audio signal path.\nHowever, due to the possible wide variation in analog supply range (2.7 V–3.6 V), an output common-mode\nvoltage setting of 1.35 V, which would be used for a 2.7 V supply case, would be overly conservative if the\nsupply is actually much larger, such as 3.3 V or 3.6 V. In order to optimize device operation, the TLV320AIC3104\nincludes a programmable output common-mode level, which can be set by register programming to a level most\nappropriate to the actual supply range used by a particular customer. The output common-mode level can be\nvaried among four different values, ranging from 1.35 V (most appropriate for low supply ranges, near 2.7 V) to\n1.8 V (most appropriate for high supply ranges, near 3.6 V). Note that the recommended DVDD voltage is\ndependent on the CM setting; see Table 10-5 .TLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n34 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nTable 10-5.

This provides power savings when only a mono playback stream is\nneeded.\n10.3.5 Audio Analog Inputs\nThe TLV320AIC3104 includes six single-ended audio inputs. These pins connect through series resistors and\nswitches to the virtual ground terminals of two fully differential operational amplifiers (one per ADC and PGA\nchannel). By selecting to turn on only one set of switches per operational amplifier at a time, the inputs can be\nmultiplexed effectively to each ADC and PGA channel.

Right Channel Signal Path\nBy selecting to turn on multiple sets of switches per operational amplifier at a time, mixing can also be achieved.\nMixing of multiple inputs can easily lead to PGA outputs that exceed the range of the internal operational\namplifiers, resulting in saturation and clipping of the mixed output signal. Whenever mixing is being\nimplemented, the user should take adequate precautions to avoid such saturation from occurring. In general, the\nmixed signal should not exceed 2 Vp-p (single-ended).\nIn most mixing applications, there is also a general need to adjust the levels of the individual signals being\nmixed. For example, if a soft signal and a large signal are to be mixed and played together, the soft signal\ngenerally should be amplified to a level comparable to the large signal before mixing. In order to accommodate\nthis need, the TLV320AIC3104 includes input level control on each of the individual inputs before they are mixed\nor multiplexed into the ADC PGAs, with gain programmable from 0 dB to –12 dB in 1.5-dB steps. Note that this\ninput level control is not intended to be a volume control, but instead used occasionally for level setting. Soft-\nstepping of the input level control settings is implemented in this device, with the speed and functionality\nfollowing the settings used by the ADC PGA for soft-stepping.TLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nFigure 10-14  shows the single-ended mixing configuration for the left-channel ADC PGA, which enables mixing\nof the signals LINE1L, LINE2L, LINE1R.

If mixing of the DAC audio with other signals is not required, and the DAC\noutput is only needed at the stereo line outputs, then it is recommended to use the routing through path\nDAC_L3/R3 to the fully differential stereo line outputs. This results not only in higher-quality output performance,\nbut also in lower-power operation, because the analog volume controls and mixing blocks ahead of these drivers\ncan be powered down.TLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n38 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nIf instead the DAC analog output must be routed to multiple output drivers simultaneously (such as to\nLEFT_LOP/M and RIGHT_LOP/M) or must be mixed with other analog signals, then the DAC outputs should be\nswitched through the DAC_L1/R1 path. This option provides the maximum flexibility for routing of the DAC\nanalog signals to the output drivers.\nThe TLV320AIC3104 includes an output level control on each output driver with limited gain adjustment from\n0 dB to 9 dB. The output driver circuitry in this device is designed to provide a low-distortion output while playing\nfull-scale stereo DAC signals at a 0-dB gain setting. However, a higher amplitude output can be obtained at the\ncost of increased signal distortion at the output. This output level control allows the user to make this tradeoff\nbased on the requirements of the end equipment. Note that this output level control is not intended to be used as\na standard output volume control. It is expected to be used only sparingly for level setting, i.e., adjustment of the\nfull-scale output range of the device.\nEach differential line output driver can be powered down independently of the others when it is not needed in the\nsystem. When placed into power down through register programming, the driver output pins are placed into a\nhigh-impedance state.\n10.3.7 Analog High-Power Output Drivers\nThe TLV320AIC3104 includes four high-power output drivers with extensive flexibility in their usage. These\noutput drivers are individually capable of driving 30 mW each into a 16- Ω load in single-ended configuration, and\nthey can be used in pairs connected in bridge-terminated load (BTL) configuration between two driver outputs.\nThe high-power output drivers can be configured in a variety of ways, including:\n1. Driving up to two fully differential output signals\n2. Driving up to four single-ended output signals\n3. Driving two single-ended output signals, with one or two of the remaining drivers driving a fixed VCM level, for\na pseudo-differential stereo output\nThe output stage architecture leading to the high-power output drivers is illustrated in Figure 10-17 , with the\nvolume control and mixing blocks being effectively identical to those depicted in Figure 10-16 . Note that each of\nthese drivers has an output level control block like those included with the line output drivers, allowing gain\nadjustment up to 9 dB on the output signal. As in the previous case, this output level adjustment is not intended\nto be used as a standard volume control, but instead is included for additional full-scale output signal-level\ncontrol.\nTwo of the output drivers, HPROUT and HPLOUT, include a direct connection path for the stereo DAC outputs to\nbe passed directly to the output drivers and bypass the analog volume controls and mixing networks, using the\nDAC_L2/R2 path. As in the line output case, this functionality provides the highest quality DAC playback\nperformance with reduced power dissipation, but can only be used if the DAC is not being routed to multiple\noutput drivers simultaneously, and if mixing of the DAC output with other analog signals is not needed.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 39\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nVCM\nVCMHPLOUT\nHPLCOM\nHPRCOM\nHPROUTDAC_L2\nDAC_R2\nPGA_LPGA_LPGA_LPGA_L\nDAC_L1DAC_L1DAC_L1DAC_L1\nDAC_R1DAC_R1DAC_R1DAC_R1\nB0159-01PGA_RPGA_RPGA_RPGA_R\nVolume\nControls,\nMixingVolume\nControls,\nMixingVolume\nControls,\nMixingVolume\nControls,\nMixingVolume□Level\n0□dB□to□9□dB,□Mute\nVolume□Level\n0□dB□to□9□dB,□Mute\nVolume□Level\n0□dB□to□9□dB,□Mute\nVolume□Level\n0□dB□to□9□dB,□MuteFigure 10-17. Architecture of the Output Stage Leading to the High-Power Output Drivers\nThe high-power output drivers include additional circuitry to avoid artifacts on the audio output during power-on\nand power-off transient conditions. The user should first program the type of output configuration being used in\npage 0, register 14, to allow the device to select the optimal power-up scheme to avoid output artifacts. The\npower-up delay time for the high-power output drivers is also programmable over a wide range of time delays,\nfrom instantaneous up to 4 s, using page 0, register 42.\nWhen these output drivers are powered down, they can be placed into a variety of output conditions based on\nregister programming. If lowest-power operation is desired, then the outputs can be placed into a high-\nimpedance state, and all power to the output stage is removed. However, this generally results in the output\nnodes drifting to rest near the upper or lower analog supply, due to small leakage currents at the pins. This then\nresults in a longer delay requirement to avoid output artifacts during driver power on. In order to reduce this\nrequired power-on delay, the TLV320AIC3104 includes an option for the output pins of the drivers to be weakly\ndriven to the VCM level they would normally rest at when powered with no signal applied. This output VCM level\nis determined by an internal band-gap voltage reference, and thus results in extra power dissipation when theTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n40 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\ndrivers are in power down. However, this option provides the fastest method for transitioning the drivers from\npower down to full-power operation without any output artifact introduced.\nThe device includes a further option that falls between the other two—although it requires less power drawn\nwhile the output drivers are in power down, it also takes a slightly longer delay to power up without artifact than if\nthe band-gap reference is kept alive. In this alternate mode, the powered-down output driver pin is weakly driven\nto a voltage of approximately half the DRVDD1/2 supply level using an internal voltage divider. This voltage does\nnot match the actual VCM of a fully powered driver, but due to the output voltage being close to its final value, a\nmuch shorter power-up delay time setting can be used and still avoid any audible output artifacts. These output\nvoltage options are controlled in page 0, register 42.\nThe high-power output drivers can also be programmed to power up first with the output level (gain) control in a\nhighly attenuated state; then the output driver automatically reduces the output attenuation slowly to reach the\nprogrammed output gain. This capability is enabled by default but can be enabled in page 0, register 40.\n10.3.8 Input Impedance and VCM Control\nThe TLV320AIC3104 includes several programmable settings to control analog input pins, particularly when they\nare not selected for connection to an ADC PGA. The default option allows unselected inputs to be put into a\nhigh-impedance state, such that the input impedance seen looking into the device is extremely high. Note,\nhowever, that the pins on the device do include protection diode circuits connected to AVDD and AVSS. Thus, if\nany voltage is driven onto a pin approximately one diode drop (~0.6 V) above AVDD or one diode drop below\nAVSS, these protection diodes begin conducting current, resulting in an effective impedance that no longer\nappears as a high-impedance state.\nIn most cases, the analog input pins on the TLV320AIC3104 should be ac-coupled to analog input sources, the\nexception to this being if an ADC is being used for dc voltage measurement. The ac-coupling capacitor causes a\nhigh-pass filter pole to be inserted into the analog signal path, so the size of the capacitor must be chosen to\nmove that filter pole sufficiently low in frequency to cause minimal effect on the processed analog signal. The\ninput impedance of the analog inputs when selected for connection to an ADC PGA varies with the setting of the\ninput level control, starting at approximately 20 k Ω with an input level control setting of 0 dB, and increasing to\napproximately 80 k Ω when the input level control is set at –12 dB. For example, using a 0.1- μF ac-coupling\ncapacitor at an analog input results in a high-pass filter pole of 80 Hz when the 0-dB input level control setting is\nselected.\n10.3.9 MICBIAS Generation\nThe TLV320AIC3104 includes a programmable microphone bias output voltage (MICBIAS), capable of providing\noutput voltages of 2 V or 2.5 V (both derived from the on-chip band-gap voltage) with 4-mA output current drive.\nIn addition, the MICBIAS can be programmed to be connected to AVDD directly through an on-chip switch, or it\ncan be powered down completely when not needed, for power savings. This function is controlled by register\nprogramming in page 0, register 25.\n10.3.10 Short-Circuit Output Protection\nThe TLV320AIC3104 includes programmable short-circuit protection for the high-power output drivers, for\nmaximum flexibility in a given application. By default, if these output drivers are shorted, they automatically limit\nthe maximum amount of current that can be sourced to or sunk from a load, thereby protecting the device from\nan overcurrent condition. In this mode, the user can read page 0, register 95 to determine whether the part is in\nshort-circuit protection or not, and then decide whether to program the device to power down the output drivers.\nHowever, the device includes further capability to power down an output driver automatically whenever it goes\ninto short-circuit protection, without requiring intervention from the user. In this case, the output driver stays in a\npower-down condition until the user specifically programs it to power down and then power back up again, to\nclear the short-circuit flag.\n10.3.11 Jack and Headset Detection\nThe TLV320AIC3104 includes extensive capability to monitor a headphone, microphone, or headset jack,\ndetermine if a plug has been inserted into the jack, and then determine what type of headset or headphone is\nwired to the plug.

The registers used for this function are page 0, registers 14, 96, 97, and 13. The type of headset\ndetected can be read back from page 0, register 13. Note that for best results, it is recommended to select a\nMICBIAS value as high as possible, and to program the output driver common-mode level at a 1.35-V or 1.5-V\nlevel.\nMICBIAS\nMIC2R\nHPLOUT\nHPROUT\nTo\nDetection\nBlockHPRCOM\nHPLCOM\n1.35□VMIC2L/LINE2L/MICDETTo□Detection□Block\nMIC□PreAmps\ns g m\ns g m ss g Stereo\nCellular\nStereo□+\nCellular\nm□=□mic\ns□=□ear□speaker\ng□=□ground/vcmAVDD\nB0243-02Pwr\nAmp\nPwr\nAmp\nPwr\nAmp\nFigure 10-18.

In some cases, only a few\nfeatures of the device are required. For these applications, the unused stages of the device must be powered\ndown to save power and an alternate route should be used. This is called a bypass path. The bypass path\nmodes let the device to save power by turning off unused stages, like ADC, DAC and PGA.\n10.4.1.1 ADC PGA Signal Bypass Path Functionality\nIn addition to the input bypass path described previously, the TLV320AIC3104 also includes the ability to route\nthe ADC PGA output signals past the ADC, for mixing with other analog signals and then direct connection to the\noutput drivers. These bypass functions are described in more detail in the sections on output mixing and output\ndriver configurations.\n10.4.1.2 Passive Analog Bypass During Power Down\nProgramming the TLV320AIC3104 to passive analog bypass occurs by configuring the output stage switches for\npassthrough. This is done by opening switches SW-L0, SW-L3, SW-R0, and SW-R3 and closing either SW-L1 or\nSW-L2 and SW-R1 or SW-R2. See Figure 10-21 . Programming this mode is done by writing to page 0, register\n108.\nConnecting the MIC1LP/LINE1LP input signal to the LEFT_LOP pin is done by closing SW-L1 and opening SW-\nL0; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D0. Connecting the MIC2L/LINE2L input signal\nto the LEFT_LOP pin is done by closing SW-L2 and opening SW-L0; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0,\nregister 108, bit D2. Connecting the MIC1LM/LINE1LM input signal to the LEFT_LOM pin is done by closing SW-\nL4 and opening SW-L3; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D1.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 43\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nConnecting the MIC1RP/LINE1RP input signal to the RIGHT_LOP pin is done by closing SW-R1 and opening\nSW-R0; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D4. Connecting the MIC2R/LINE2R input\nsignal to the RIGHT_LOP pin is done by closing SW-R2 and opening SW-R0; this action is done by writing a 1 to\npage 0, register 108, bit D6. Connecting MIC1RM/LINE1RM input signal to the RIGHT_LOM pin is done by\nclosing SW-R4 and opening SW-R3; this action is done by writing a 1 to page 0, register 108, bit D5. A diagram\nof the passive analog bypass mode configuration is shown in Figure 10-21 .\nIn general, connecting two switches to the same output pin should be avoided, as this error shorts two input\nsignals together, and would likely cause distortion of the signal as the two signals are in contention. Poor\nfrequency response would also likely occur.\nMIC1RM  / LINE1RMMIC1RP / LINE1RPLINE1RP\nLINE1RMMIC1LM  / LINE1LMMIC1LP / LINE1LPLINE1LP\nLINE1LM\nLINE1RP\nLINE1RMSW-R0\nSW-R3SW-R1\nSW-R4LINE1LP\nLINE1LMSW-L0\nSW-L3SW-L1\nSW-L4\nRIGHT_LOMRIGHT_LOPLEFT_LOMLEFT_LOP\nFigure 10-21. Passive Analog Bypass Mode Configuration\n10.4.2 Digital Audio Processing for Record Path\nIn applications where record- only is selected, and DAC is powered down, the playback path signal processing\nblocks can be used in the ADC record path. These filtering blocks can support high-pass, low-pass, band-pass\nor notch filtering. In this mode, the record-only path has switches SW-D1 through SW-D4 closed, and reroutes\nthe ADC output data through the digital signal processing blocks. Because the DAC digital signal processing\nblocks are being re-used, naturally the addresses of these digital filter coefficients are the same as for the DAC\ndigital processing and are located on page 1, registers 1–52. This record-only mode is enabled by powering\ndown both DACs by writing to page 0, register 37, bits D7–D6 (D7 = D6 = 0). Next, enable the digital filter\npathway for the ADC by writing a 1 to page 0, register 107, bit D3. (Note, this pathway is only enabled if both\nDACs are powered down.) This record-only path is illustrated in Figure 10-22 .TLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n44 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nDigital Audio□Data□Serial□Interface\nADC+\n+DIN\nDOUTBCLK\nWCLK\nDINLDINR DOUTL DOUTR\nADCAGC\nAGCRecord□Path\nRecord□PathEffects\nEffectsSW-D1SW-D2\nSW-D4\nSW-D3Left-Channel\nAnalog□Inputs\nRight-Channel\nAnalog□InputsPGA\n0□dB–59.5□dB,\n0.5-dB□Steps\nPGA\n0□dB–59.5□dB,\n0.5-dB□StepsVolume\nControl\nVolume\nControlDAC\nPowered\nDown\nDAC\nPowered\nDownDAC\nL\nDAC\nR\nB0173-01Figure 10-22. Record- Only  Mode With Digital Processing Path Enabled\n10.5 Programming\n10.5.1 I2C Control Interface\nThe TLV320AIC3104 supports the I2C control protocol using 7-bit addressing and is capable of both standard\nand fast modes. For I2C fast mode, note that the minimum timing for each of t HD-STA , tSU-STA , and t SU-STO  is 0.9\nμs, as illustrated in Figure 10-23 . The TLV320AIC3104 responds to the I2C address of 001 \u20091000. I2C is a two-\nwire, open-drain interface supporting multiple devices and masters on a single bus. Devices on the I2C bus only\ndrive the bus lines LOW by connecting them to ground; they never drive the bus lines HIGH. Instead, the bus\nwires are pulled HIGH by pullup resistors, so the bus wires are HIGH when no device is driving them LOW. This\nway, two devices cannot conflict; if two devices drive the bus simultaneously, there is no driver contention.www.ti.comTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 45\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nSDA\nSCLtHD-STA0.9 s/c179 /c109\ntSU-STO 0.9 s/c179 /c109\nP StSU-STA0.9 s/c179 /c109\nSrtHD-STA0.9 s/c179 /c109\nS\nT0114-02Figure 10-23. I2C Interface Timing\nCommunication on the I2C bus always takes place between two devices, one acting as the master and the other\nacting as the slave. Both masters and slaves can read and write, but slaves can only do so under the direction of\nthe master. Some I2C devices can act as masters or slaves, but the TLV320AIC3104 can only act as a slave\ndevice.\nAn I2C bus consists of two lines, SDA and SCL. SDA carries data; SCL provides the clock. All data is transmitted\nacross the I2C bus in groups of eight bits. To send a bit on the I2C bus, the SDA line is driven to the appropriate\nlevel while SCL is LOW (a LOW on SDA indicates the bit is zero; a HIGH indicates the bit is one). Once the SDA\nline has settled, the SCL line is brought HIGH, then LOW. This pulse on SCL clocks the SDA bit into the receiver\nshift register.\nThe I2C bus is bidirectional: the SDA line is used both for transmitting and receiving data. When a master reads\nfrom a slave, the slave drives the data line; when a master sends to a slave, the master drives the data line.\nUnder normal circumstances the master drives the clock line.\nMost of the time the bus is idle, no communication is taking place, and both lines are HIGH. When\ncommunication is taking place, the bus is active. Only master devices can start a communication. They do this\nby causing a START condition on the bus. Normally, the data line is only allowed to change state while the clock\nline is LOW. If the data line changes state while the clock line is HIGH, it is either a START condition or its\ncounterpart, a STOP condition. A START condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from\nHIGH to LOW. A STOP condition is when the clock line is HIGH and the data line goes from LOW to HIGH.\nAfter the master issues a START condition, it sends a byte that indicates which slave device it wants to\ncommunicate with. This byte is called the address byte. Each device on an I2C bus has a unique 7-bit address to\nwhich it responds. (Slaves can also have 10-bit addresses; see the I2C specification for details.) The master\nsends an address in the address byte, together with a bit that indicates whether it wishes to read from or write to\nthe slave device.\nEvery byte transmitted on the I2C bus, whether it is address or data, is acknowledged with an acknowledge bit.\nWhen a master has finished sending a byte (eight data bits) to a slave, it stops driving SDA and waits for the\nslave to acknowledge the byte. The slave acknowledges the byte by pulling SDA LOW. The master then sends a\nclock pulse to clock the acknowledge bit. Similarly, when a master has finished reading a byte, it pulls SDA LOW\nto acknowledge this to the slave. It then sends a clock pulse to clock the bit.\nA not-acknowledge is performed by simply leaving SDA HIGH during an acknowledge cycle. If a device is not\npresent on the bus, and the master attempts to address it, it receives a not-acknowledge because no device is\npresent at that address to pull the line LOW.TLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021 www.ti.com\n46 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nWhen a master has finished communicating with a slave, it may issue a STOP condition. When a STOP\ncondition is issued, the bus becomes idle again. A master may also issue another START condition. When a\nSTART condition is issued while the bus is active, it is called a repeated START condition.\nThe TLV320AIC3104 also responds to and acknowledges a general call, which consists of the master issuing a\ncommand with a slave-address byte of 00h.\nDA(6) DA(0) RA(7) RA(0) D(7) D(0)\nT0147-01SDASCL\n(M) – SDA Controlled□by□Master\n(S) – SDA Controlled□by□SlaveStart\n(M)Write\n(M)Slave\nAck\n(S)Slave\nAck\n(S)Slave\nAck\n(S)Stop\n(M)7-Bit□Device Address\n(M)8-Bit□Register Address\n(M)8-Bit□Register□data\n(M)\nFigure 10-24.

I2C Read\nIn the case of an I2C register write, if the master does not issue a STOP condition, then the device enters auto-\nincrement mode. So in the next eight clocks, the data on SDA is treated as data for the next incremental register.\nSimilarly, in the case of an I2C register read, after the device has sent out the 8-bit data from the addressed\nregister, if the master issues an acknowledge, the slave takes over control of the SDA bus and transmits for the\nnext 8 clocks the data of the next incremental register.\n10.5.1.1 I2C Bus Debug in a Glitched System\nOccasionally, some systems may encounter noise or glitches on the I2C bus. In the unlikely event that this\naffects bus performance, then it can be useful to use the I2C Debug register. This feature terminates the I2C bus\nerror allowing this I2C device and system to resume communications. The I2C bus error detector is enabled by\ndefault. The TLV320AIC3104 I2C error detector status can be read from page 0, register 107, bit D0. If desired,\nthe detector can be disabled by writing to page 0, register 107, bit D2.\n10.5.2 Register Map Structure\nThe register map of the TLV320AIC3104 actually consists of two pages of registers, with each page containing\n128 registers. The register at address zero on each page is used as a page-control register, and writing to this\nregister determines the active page for the device. All subsequent read or write operations access the page that\nis active at the time, unless a register write is performed to change the active page. The active page defaults to\npage 0 on device reset.\nFor example, at device reset, the active page defaults to page 0, and thus all register read or write operations for\naddresses 1 to 127 access registers in page 0. If registers on page 1 must be accessed, the user must write the\n8-bit sequence 0x01 to register 0, the page control register, to change the active page from page 0 to page 1.\nAfter this write, it is recommended that the user also read back the page control register, to ensure the change in\npage control has occurred properly. Future read or write operations to addresses 1 to 127 now access registers\nin page 1. When page-0 registers must be accessed again, the user writes the 8-bit sequence 0x00 to register 0,www.ti.comTLV320AIC3104\nSLAS510G – MARCH 2007 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 47\nProduct Folder Links: TLV320AIC3104\nthe page control register, to change the active page back to page 0. After a recommended read of the page\ncontrol register, all further read or write operations to addresses 1 to 127 access page-0 registers again.\n10.6 Register Maps\nThe control registers for the TLV320AIC3104 are described in detail as follows. All registers are 8 bits in width,\nwith D7 referring to the most-significant bit of each register, and D0 referring to the least-significant bit.\nTable 10-6.

TI’s customers are responsible for determining\nsuitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n11.1 Application Information\nThe TLV320AIC3104 is a highly integrated low-power stereo audio codec with integrated stereo headphone or\nline amplifier, as well as multiple inputs and outputs that are programmable in single-ended or fully differential\nconfigurations. All the features of the TLV320AIC3104 are accessed by programmable registers. External\nprocessor with I2C protocol is required to control the device. It is good practice to perform a hardware reset after\ninitial power up to ensure that all registers are in their default states. Extensive register-based power control is\nincluded, enabling stereo 48-kHz DAC playback as low as 14-mW from a 3.3-V analog supply, making it ideal for\nportable battery-powered audio and telephony applications.\n11.2 Typical Applications\n11.2.1 Typical Connections With Headphone and External Speaker Driver in Portable Application\nTLV320AIC3104MIC2L/LINE2LMIC1LP/LINE1LP\nMIC1RP/LINE1RPMIC2R/LINE2RMIC1LM/LINE1LM0.1 F/c109\n0.1 F/c109\n0.47 F /c109\n0.47 F /c109\n0.1 F/c1090.1 F/c1090.1 F/c109\n0.1 F/c109\n0.1 F/c109\n1 F/c1091 F/c109\n100 F /c109\n100 F /c1091 F/c109\n1 F/c109 1 F/c10910 F/c109\n0.47 F /c109\n0.47 F /c1090.47 F /c109\n0.47 F /c109MICBIAS\nAAVDD_DAC\nAVSS_DACAVSS_ADCDRVDD\nDVDD\nDVSSIOVDDDRVDD\nDRVSS\nS0206-01AD1.525 V–1.95 V\nLEFT_LOP\nLEFT_LOM RIGHT_ROPRIGHT_ROM HPLCOM HPLOUT\nHPROUTA\nHPRCOMMIC1RM/LINE1RM\nASDASCLIOVDD\nRESETMCLKBCLKWCLKDOUTDINDSP\nor\nApps ProcessorRPRP\n1 k/c87\n1 k/c87\nFM\nTuner\nAnalog\nBasebandIOVDD\n(1.1 V–3.3 V)AVDD\n(2.7 V–3.6 V)\n8/c87\n8/c87External Audio Power Amplifiers\nTPA2012D2 (Stereo Class-D in WCSP)\nTPA2010D1 (Mono Class-D in WCSP)\nTPA2005D1 (Mono Class-D in BGA, QFN, MSOP)\nFigure 11-1.

However, in\nsome rare instances, unexpected conditions can be attributed to power supply sequencing. The following\nsequence will provide the most robust operation.\nPower up IOVDD first. The analog supplies, which include AVDD and DRVDD, should be powered up second.\nThe digital supply DVDD should be powered up last. Keep RESET  low until all supplies are stable. The analog\nsupplies should be greater than or equal to DVDD at all times.\nIOVDD\nAVDD, DRVDD\nDVDDt1\nt2\nt3\nRESETt4\nFigure 12-1. TLV320AIC3104 Power Supply Sequencing\nTable 12-1.
