DRB Package\n3-mm × 3-mm, 8-Pin VSON\nTop View \nTable 5-1. Pin Functions\nNAME NO. I/O DESCRIPTION\nCWD 2 IProgrammable watchdog timeout input. The watchdog timeout is set by connecting a capacitor between this \npin and ground. Connecting via a 10-kΩ resistor to V DD or leaving unconnected further enables the selection \nof the preset watchdog timeouts; see the CWD Functionality  section.\nThe TPS3851-Q1 determines the watchdog timeout using either Equation 1  or Equation 2  with standard or \nextended timing, respectively.\nGND 4 — Ground pin\nMR 3 IManual reset pin. A logical low on this pin issues a RESET . This pin is internally pulled up to V DD. RESET \nremains low for a fixed reset delay (t RST) time after MR is deasserted (high).\nRESET 8 OReset output. Connect RESET  using a 1-kΩ to 100-kΩ resistor to the correct pullup voltage rail (V PU). \nRESET  goes low when V DD goes below the undervoltage threshold (V ITN). When V DD is within the normal \noperating range, the RESET  timeout-counter starts. At completion, RESET  goes high. During startup, the \nstate of RESET  is undefined below the specified power-on-reset (POR) voltage (V POR). Above POR, RESET \ngoes low and remains low until the monitored voltage is within the correct operating range (above V ITN + \nVHYST) and the RESET  timeout is complete.\nSET1 5 ILogic input. Grounding the SET1 pin disables the watchdog timer. SET1 and CWD select the watchdog \ntimeouts; see the SET1  section.\nVDD 1 I Supply voltage pin. For noisy systems, connecting a 0.1-μF bypass capacitor is recommended.\nWDI 6 IWatchdog input. A falling edge must occur at WDI before the timeout (t WD) expires.\nWhen the watchdog is not in use, the SET1 pin can be used to disable the watchdog. WDI is ignored when \nRESET  or WDO  are low (asserted) and when the watchdog is disabled. If the watchdog is disabled, WDI \ncannot be left unconnected and must be driven to either VDD or GND.\nWDO 7 OWatchdog output. Connect WDO  with a 1-kΩ to 100-kΩ resistor to the correct pullup voltage rail (V PU). \nWDO  goes low (asserts) when a watchdog timeout occurs. WDO  only asserts when RESET  is high. When \na watchdog timeout occurs, WDO  goes low (asserts) for the set RESET  timeout delay (t RST). When RESET \ngoes low, WDO  is in a high-impedance state.\nThermal pad — Connect the thermal pad to a large-area ground plane. The thermal pad is internally connected to GND.www.ti.comTPS3851-Q1\nSBVS286A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: TPS3851-Q1\n6 Specifications\n6.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nover operating free-air temperature range (unless otherwise noted) (1)\nMIN MAX UNIT\nSupply voltage range VDD –0.3 7 V\nOutput voltage range RESET , WDO –0.3 7 V\nVoltage rangesSET1, WDI, MR –0.3 7\nV\nCWD –0.3 VDD + 0.3 (3)\nOutput pin current RESET , WDO ±20 mA\nInput current (all pins) ±20 mA\nContinuous total power dissipation See Section 6.4\nTemperatureOperating junction, T J (2)–40 150\n°C Operating free-air, T A (2)–40 150\nStorage, T stg –65 150\n(1) Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings  may cause permanent damage to the device.

This device includes \na precision undervoltage supervisor with a threshold that achieves 0.8% accuracy over the specified temperature \nrange of –40°C to +125°C. In addition, the TPS3851-Q1 includes accurate hysteresis on the threshold, making \nthe device ideal for use with tight tolerance systems where voltage supervisors must ensure a RESET  before the \nminimum supply tolerance of the microprocessor or system-on-a-chip (SoC) is reached. There are two options \nfor the watchdog timing standard and extended timing. To get standard timing use the TPS3851Xyy(y)S-Q1, for \nextended timing use the TPS3851Xyy(y)E-Q1.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVDD\nPrecision\nClock\nState \nMachineCap\nControlCWD\nGNDVDD\nWDI MR SET1WDORESET\nReferenceR1\nR2\nR1 + R 2 = 4.5 MΩ.\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 RESET\nConnect RESET  to V PU through a 1-k Ω to 100-k Ω pullup resistor. RESET  remains high (deasserted) when \nVDD is greater than the negative threshold voltage (V ITN). If V DD falls below the negative threshold (V ITN), then \nRESET  is asserted, driving the RESET  pin to low impedance. When V DD rises above V ITN + V HYST, a delay \ncircuit is enabled that holds RESET  low for a specified reset delay period (t RST). When the reset delay has \nelapsed, the RESET  pin goes to a high-impedance state and uses a pullup resistor to hold RESET  high. The \npullup resistor must be connected to the proper voltage rail to allow other devices to be connected at the correct \ninterface voltage. To ensure proper voltage levels, give some consideration when choosing the pullup resistor \nvalues. The pullup resistor value is determined by output logic low voltage (V OL), capacitive loading, leakage \ncurrent (I D), and the current through the RESET  pin I RESET .www.ti.comTPS3851-Q1\nSBVS286A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS3851-Q1\n7.3.2 Manual Reset MR\nThe manual reset ( MR) input allows a processor or other logic circuits to initiate a reset. A logic low on MR \ncauses RESET  to assert. After MR returns to a logic high and V DD is above V ITN + V HYST, RESET  is deasserted \nafter the reset delay time (t RST). If MR is not controlled externally, then MR can either be connected to V DD or left \nfloating because the MR pin is internally pulled up.\n7.3.3 UV Fault Detection\nThe TPS3851-Q1 features undervoltage detection for common rails between 1.8 V and 5 V. The voltage is \nmonitored on the input rail of the device. If V DD drops below V ITN, then RESET  is asserted (driven low).\nFigure 7-1  shows that when V DD is above V ITN + V HYST, RESET  deasserts after t RST. The internal comparator \nhas built-in hysteresis that provides some noise immunity and ensures stable operation. Although not required \nin most cases, for noisy applications, good analog design practice is to place a 1-nF to 100-nF bypass capacitor \nclose to the VDD pin to reduce sensitivity to transient voltages on the monitored signal.\nUndervoltage LimitVDD\nVITNVITN + V HYST\nRESET\ntRST-DEL tRST\ntRST-DEL\nFigure 7-1. Undervoltage Detection\n7.3.4 Watchdog Mode\nThis section provides information for the watchdog mode of operation.\n7.3.4.1 CWD\nThe CWD pin provides the user the functionality of both high-precision, factory-programmed watchdog timing \noptions and user-programmable watchdog timing. The TPS3851-Q1 features three options for setting the \nwatchdog timer: connecting a capacitor to the CWD pin, connecting a pullup resistor to VDD, and leaving the \nCWD pin unconnected. The configuration of the CWD pin is evaluated by the device every time V DD enters the \nvalid region (V ITN + V HYST < V DD). The pin evaluation is controlled by an internal state machine that determines \nwhich option is connected to the CWD pin. The sequence of events typically takes 381 μs (tINIT) to determine \nif the CWD pin is left unconnected, pulled-up through a resistor, or connected to a capacitor. If the CWD pin is \nbeing pulled up to VDD, a 10-kΩ resistor is required.\n7.3.4.2 Watchdog Input WDI\nWDI is the watchdog timer input that controls the WDO  output. The WDI input is triggered by the falling edge \nof the input signal. To ensure proper functionality of the watchdog timer, always issue the WDI pulse before \ntWD(min) . If the pulse is issued in this region, then WDO  remains unasserted. Otherwise, the device asserts WDO , \nputting the WDO  pin into a low-impedance state.\nThe watchdog input (WDI) is a digital pin. In order to ensure there is no increase in I DD, drive the WDI pin to \neither VDD or GND at all times. Putting the pin to an intermediate voltage can cause an increase in supply \ncurrent (I DD) because of the architecture of the digital logic gates. When RESET  is asserted, the watchdog is \ndisabled and all signals input to WDI are ignored. When RESET  is no longer asserted, the device resumes \nnormal operation and no longer ignores the signal on WDI. If the watchdog is disabled, drive the WDI pin to \neither VDD or GND. Figure 7-2  shows the valid region for a WDI pulse to be issued to prevent WDO  from being \ntriggered and pulled low.TPS3851-Q1\nSBVS286A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS3851-Q1\nTimingWDI\ntWD(MIN)\ntWD(TYP)\ntWD(MAX)WDO\n =  Tolerance WindowCorrect \nOperation\nWDO\nLate FaultWDI\nValid\nRegionFigure 7-2.

The independent \nwatchdog output provides the flexibility to flag a fault in the watchdog timing without performing an entire system \nreset. When RESET  is not asserted (high), the WDO  signal maintains normal operation. When asserted, WDO \nremains low for t RST. When the RESET  signal is asserted (low), the WDO  pin goes to a high-impedance state. \nWhen RESET  is unasserted, the watchdog timer resumes normal operation.www.ti.comTPS3851-Q1\nSBVS286A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS3851-Q1\n7.3.4.4 SET1\nThe SET1 pin can enable and disable the watchdog timer. If SET1 is set to GND, the watchdog timer is disabled \nand WDI is ignored. If the watchdog timer is disabled, drive the WDI pin to either GND or VDD to ensure that \nthere is no increase in I DD. When SET1 is logic high, the watchdog operates normally. The SET1 pin can be \nchanged dynamically; however, if the watchdog is going from disabled to enabled (as shown in Figure 7-3 ) there \nis a 150-µs setup time where the watchdog does not respond to changes on WDI.\nSET1VDD\nRESET\nWatchdog \nEnabled/Disabled Disabled Enabled Enabled150 µs\nFigure 7-3.

Figure 8-1  shows a schematic \ndrawing of all three options. If this pin is connected to VDD through a 10-k Ω pullup resistor or left unconnected \n(high impedance), then the factory-programmed watchdog timeouts are enabled; see the Section 8.1.1.1  section. \nOtherwise, the watchdog timeout can be adjusted by placing a capacitor from the CWD pin to ground.\nVDD\nCCWD\nCap\nControl375 nA \nCWDVDD\nCWD10 k\r\nCWD\nUser Programmable \nCapacitor to GND10 N\x9f\x035HVLVWRU\x03\nto VDD CWD\nUnconnectedTPS3851-Q1 TPS3851-Q1 TPS3851-Q1VDD\nVDD\nCap\nControl375 nA VDD\nCap\nControl375 nA VDD\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 8-1.

If a capacitor is connected \nto CWD, then a 375-nA, constant-current source charges C CWD until V CWD = 1.21 V. Table 8-2  shows how \nto calculate t WD using Equation 1 , Equation 2 , and the SET1 pin. The TPS3851-Q1 determines the watchdog \ntimeout with the formulas given in Equation 1  and Equation 2 , where C CWD is in nanofarads and t WD is in \nmilliseconds.\ntWD(standard)  (ms) = 3.23 × C CWD (nF) + 0.381 (ms) (1)\ntWD(extended)  (ms) = 77.4 × C CWD (nF) + 55 (ms) (2)\nThe TPS3851-Q1 is designed and tested using C CWD capacitors between 100 pF and 1 µF. Equation 1  and \nEquation 2  are for ideal capacitors; capacitor tolerances vary the actual device timing. For the most accurate \ntiming, use ceramic capacitors with COG dielectric material. If a C CWD capacitor is used, Equation 1  can be \nused to set t WD for standard timing. Use Equation 2  to calculate t WD for extended timing. Table 8-3  shows the \nminimum and maximum calculated t WD values using an ideal capacitor for both standard and extended timing.\nTable 8-2.

If the voltage is just under the trip point for \na long period of time, RESET  asserts and the output is pulled low. However, if V DD is just under the trip point for \na few nanoseconds, RESET  does not assert and the output remains high. The length of time required for RESET \nto assert can be changed by increasing the amount V DD goes under the trip point. If V DD is under the trip point \nby 10%, the amount of time required for the comparator to respond is much faster and causes RESET  to assert \nmuch quicker than when barely under the trip point voltage. Equation 3  shows how to calculate the percentage \noverdrive.\nOverdrive = |((V DD / VITX) – 1) × 100% | (3)\nIn Equation 3 , VITX corresponds to the threshold trip point. If V DD is exceeding the positive threshold,\nVITN + V HYST is used. V ITN is used when V DD is falling below the negative threshold. In Figure 8-2 , t1 and t 2 \ncorrespond to the amount of time that V DD is over the threshold; the propagation delay versus overdrive for V ITN \nand V ITN + V HYST is illustrated in Figure 6-16  and Figure 6-18 , respectively.\nThe TPS3851-Q1 is relatively immune to short positive and negative transients on VDD because of the overdrive \nvoltage curve.\nTimeInput VoltageVITNVDDt1\nt2ûV1 \nûV2 VITN + V HYST\nFigure 8-2.

To ensure \nthis requirement is met, the TPS3851G18S-Q1 was chosen for its –4% threshold. To calculate the worst-case for \nVITN, the accuracy must also be taken into account. The worst-case for V ITN can be calculated by Equation 4 :\nVITN(Worst Case)  = V ITN(typ)  × 0.992 = 1.8 × 0.96 × 0.992 = 1.714 V (4)TPS3851-Q1\nSBVS286A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS3851-Q1\n8.2.2.2 Calculating the RESET  and WDO  Pullup Resistor\nFigure 8-4  shows the TPS3851-Q1 using an open-drain configuration for the RESET  circuit. When the FET is off, \nthe resistor pulls the drain of the transistor to VDD and when the FET is turned on, the FET attempts to pull the \ndrain to ground, thus creating an effective resistor divider. The resistors in this divider must be chosen to ensure \nthat V OL is below the maximum value. To choose the proper pullup resistor, there are three key specifications to \nkeep in mind: the pullup voltage (V PU), the recommended maximum RESET  pin current (I RESET ), and V OL. The \nmaximum V OL is 0.4 V, meaning that the effective resistor divider created must be able to bring the voltage on \nthe reset pin below 0.4 V with I RESET  kept below 10 mA. For this example, with a V PU of 1.8 V, a resistor must \nbe chosen to keep I RESET  below 50 μA because this value is the maximum consumption current allowed. To \nensure this specification is met, a pullup resistor value of 100 k Ω was selected, which sinks a maximum of 18 μA \nwhen RESET  or WDO  is asserted. As illustrated in Figure 6-13 , the RESET  current is at 18 μA and the low-level \noutput voltage is approximately zero.\nRESETVPU\nRESET \nCONTROL\nFigure 8-4. RESET  Open-Drain Configuration\n8.2.2.3 Setting the Watchdog\nAs illustrated in Figure 8-1  there are three options for setting the watchdog timer. The design specifications \nin this application require the programmable timing option (external capacitor connected to CWD). When a \ncapacitor is connected to the CWD pin, the watchdog timer is governed by Equation 1  for the standard timing \nversion. However, only the standard version is capable of meeting this timing requirement. Equation 1  is only \nvalid for ideal capacitors, any temperature or voltage derating must be accounted for separately.\nCCWD (nF) = (t WD(ms) – 0.0381) / 3.23 = (10 – 0.381) / 3.23 = 2.97 nF (5)\nThe nearest standard capacitor value to 2.9 nF is 2.7 nF. Selecting 2.7 nF for the C CWD capacitor gives the \nfollowing minimum timing parameters:\ntWD(MIN)  = 0.905 × t WD(TYP)  = 0.905 × (3.23 × 2.7 + 0.381) = 8.24 ms (6)\ntWD(MAX)  = 1.095 × t WD(TYP)  = 1.095 × (3.23 × 2.7 + 0.381) = 9.97 ms (7)\nCapacitor tolerance also influences t WD(MIN)  and t WD(MAX) . Select a ceramic COG dielectric capacitor for high \naccuracy. For 2.7 nF, COG capacitors are readily available with 5% tolerances. This selection results in a 5% \ndecrease in t WD(MIN)  and a 5% increase in t WD(MAX) , giving 7.34 ms and 11 ms, respectively. To ensure proper \nfunctionality, a falling edge must be issued before t WD(min) . Figure 8-6  illustrates that a WDI signal with a period \nof 5 ms keeps WDO  from asserting.www.ti.comTPS3851-Q1\nSBVS286A – MARCH 2017 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS3851-Q1\n8.2.2.4 Watchdog Disabled During Initialization Period\nThe watchdog is often needed to be disabled during startup to allow for an initialization period. When the \ninitialization period is over, the watchdog timer is turned back on to allow the microcontroller to be monitored \nby the TPS3851-Q1. To achieve this setup, SET1 must start at GND. In this design, SET1 is controlled by a \nTPS3890-Q1  supervisor. In this application, the TPS3890-Q1 was chosen to monitor VDD as well, which means \nthat the RESET  on the TPS3890-Q1 stays low until V DD rises above V ITN. When VDD comes up, the delay time \ncan be adjusted through the CT capacitor on the TPS3890-Q1. With this approach, the RESET  delay can be \nadjusted from a minimum of 25 μs to a maximum of 30 seconds. For this design, a typical delay of 5 seconds \nis needed before the watchdog timer is enabled. The CT capacitor calculation (see the TPS3890-Q1 data sheet ) \nyields an ideal capacitance of 4.67 μF, giving a closest standard ceramic capacitor value of 4.7 μF. When \nconnecting a 4.7- μF capacitor from CT to GND, the typical delay time is 5 seconds. Figure 8-5  shows that when \nthe watchdog is disabled, the WDO  output remains high. However when SET1 goes high and there is no WDI \nsignal, WDO  begins to assert. See the TPS3890-Q1 data sheet  for detailed information on the TPS3890-Q1.\n8.2.3 Glitch Immunity\nFigure 8-8  shows the high-to-low glitch immunity for the TPS3851G18S-Q1 with a 7% overdrive with V DD starting \nat 1.8 V. This curve shows that V DD can go below the threshold for at least 6 µs before RESET  asserts.\n8.2.4 Application Curves\nUnless otherwise stated, application curves were taken at T A = 25°C.\nRESET\n2V/divWDO\n2V/divSET1\n2V/divVDD\n2V/div\n1s/div6 seconds\nFigure 8-5.
