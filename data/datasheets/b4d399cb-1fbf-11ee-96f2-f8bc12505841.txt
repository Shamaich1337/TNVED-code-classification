The ratiometric \noutput voltage is set by the supply voltage and varies \nin proportion to the strength of the magnetic field. The \nintegrated circuitry provides increased temperature stability \nand sensitivity. Laser-trimmed, thin film resistors provide high \naccuracy (null to ±%, sensitivity up to ±3%) and temperature \ncompensation. They respond to either positive or negative \nGauss, monitoring either or both magnetic poles. The quad \nHall sensing element minimizes the effects of mechanical \nor thermal stress on the output. The positive temperature \ncoefficient of the sensitivity (+0.02%/°C typical) helps \ncompensate for the negative temperature coefficients of \nlow-cost magnets, providing a robust design over a wide \ntemperature range. Rail-to-rail operation (over full voltage \nrange) provides a more usable signal for higher accuracy. \nThese products have an operating temperature range of \n-40°C to 150°C [-40°F to 302°F], appropriate for industrial \nand automotive environments. The SS490B versions \noffer cost-effective sensing solutions with wider null and \nsensitivity tolerances, and a wider drift over temperature than \nthe SS490A higher performance products. Both the SS490A \nand SS490B versions have a typical sinking or sourcing \noutput of 1.5 mA continuous, use 7 mA supply current at 5.0 V \nat 25°C [77°F], and provide predictable performance over the \nfull temperature range. For design flexibility, these products \nare available in the following flat TO-92 package styles:\n• SS4XX:  Straight standard leads, bulk pack\n• SS4XX-L:  Straight long leads, bulk pack\n• SS4XX-T2 : Formed leads, ammopack tape-in-box\n• SS4XX-T3:  Straight standard leads, ammopack tape-in-box\n• SS4XX-S:  Surface mount, bulk pack\n• SS4XX-SP:  Surface mount, pocket tape and ree lDatasheetLinear Hall-effect Sensor ICs: \nSS490 Series 055843\nIssue 2\n2\nSensing and Internet of ThingsLinear Hall-effect Sensor ICs:\nSS490 SeriesTable 3.

#### Description:
The **SS496A** is a linear Hall-effect sensor integrated circuit (IC) designed to detect magnetic fields. It operates by producing a ratiometric output voltage that varies in proportion to the strength of the magnetic field applied. The device features a quad Hall sensing element that enhances temperature stability and sensitivity, making it suitable for various applications. The sensor is capable of monitoring both magnetic poles and provides a predictable performance over a wide temperature range.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Industrial:**
  - Current sensing for motor load monitoring
  - Anti-tampering magnetic field sensor in smart remote utility meters
  - Pump control in heavy-duty equipment and household appliances
  - Linear or angular displacement sensing
  - Handlebar/throttle position sensing in e-bikes and scooters
  - Speed adjustment triggers in tools and appliances
  - Magnetic code reading in security systems
- **Medical:**
  - Position sensing in infusion pumps

The SS496A is particularly useful in applications requiring precise magnetic field detection and is designed to operate reliably in harsh environments, making it a versatile choice for both industrial and medical applications.
