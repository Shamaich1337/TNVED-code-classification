The circuit can be pro-grammed to divide from N = 1 to N = 4 in the 400 MHz to 6 GHz input frequency range. The high level out- put power (up to 6 dBm single ended) with a very low SSB phase noise and 50% duty cycle makes this  \ndevice ideal for low noise clock generation, LO generation and LO drive applications. Configurable  \nbias and output power controls allow current consumption and output power control. The device incorporates a power down feature, good input to output isolation and fast start up time. The HMC905LP3E can be included into fast switching “ping-pong” applications.Low Noise Floor: \n    -164 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz Offset for N = 4\nProgrammable Frequency Divider, N = 1, 2, 3 or 4400 MHz to 6 GHz Input Frequency RangeUp to +6 dBm Output PowerSleep Mode: Consumes <1 µA16 Lead 3X3 mm SMT Package: 9mm\n2\nElectrical Specifications,  TA = +25° C, Vcc = +3.3V, Z o = 50ΩThe HMC905LP3E is ideal for:• LO Generation with Low Noise Floor• Software Defined Radios• Clock Generators• Fast Switching Synthesizers• Military Applications• Test Equipment• Sensors\nParameter Conditions Min.

Such dividers are high gain devices with internal feedback. The \ndevice will oscillate if used with AC coupled RF inputs and if no RF input is applied. Normally, if the RF input signal is removed the device should be disabled, or it should be placed in divide by 1 mode. The device is stable in divide by one mode with no RF input. The device will oscillate in divide 2, 3, or 4 modes with no RF input. In general, very small RF input levels will stop all oscillations. At the minimum rated RF input sensitivity level or higher, no oscillations or spurious signals exist and excellent low noise performance is achieved. For input frequency lower than 400 MHz, square wave input signal is recommended.\nFor single ended applications, apply the signal on the positive input RFinp and terminate the unused output with 50 \nohms.\nInformation furn ished by An alog Devices is believed to be a ccurate and reliable.
