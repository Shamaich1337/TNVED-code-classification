General description\nThe PCA9555 provides 16 bits of General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for\nI²C-bus/SMBus applications. It is designed for a wide voltage range of 2.3 V to 5.5 V with interrupt\nand default pull-up resistors on GPIOs. Nexperia GPIO expanders provide an elegant solution\nwhen additional IOs are needed while keeping the interconnections to a minimum, for example,\nin ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs and fan control. The PCA9555 contains a\nset of 8 bit Input, Output, Configuration and Polarity Inversion registers. At power up all IOs default\nto inputs. Each IO can be configured as either input or output by changing the corresponding bit\nin the configuration register. The data for each input or output is stored in the corresponding Input\nor Output register. The polarity inversion register can be programmed to invert the polarity of the\ninput register. The PCA9555 has an open-drain interrupt output which is activated when any one\nof the GPIO changes from its corresponding input port register state. The power on reset sets\nthe registers to default values and initializes the device state machine. The PCA9555 has three\naddress pins A0, A1 and A2 which can be used to configure the I²C bus slave address of the\ndevice. It allows up-to eight devices to share the same I²C-bus/SMBus.\n2.

Input port register pair (00h, 01h)\nThe Input port registers (registers 0 and 1) define the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless\nof whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. The Input port\nregisters are read only; writes to these registers have no effect. The default value ‘X’ is determined\nby the externally applied logic level. An Input port register read operation is performed as described\nin Section 7.2.\nTable 4.

Polarity inversion register pair (04h, 05h)\nThe Polarity inversion registers (registers 4 and 5) allow polarity inversion of pins defined as inputs\nby the Configuration register. If a bit in these registers is set (written with ‘1’), the corresponding\nport pin’s polarity is inverted in the Input register. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with a ‘0’),\nthe corresponding port pin’s polarity is retained. A register pair write is described in Section 7.1 and\na register pair read is described in Section 7.2.\nTable 8.

Configuration register pair (06h, 07h)\nThe Configuration registers (registers 6 and 7) configure the direction of the I/O pins. If a bit in\nthese registers is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as a high-impedance input. If a bit\nin these registers is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin is enabled as an output.

I/O port\nWhen an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a high-impedance\ninput. The input voltage may be raised above V CC to a maximum of 5.5 V.\nIf the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the Output port\nregister. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and either VCC or GND.\nThe external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the recommended levels for proper\noperation.\nVCC\nP0_0 to P0_7\nP1_0 to P1_7output port \nregister dataconfiguration \nregister\nD Q\nCK Qdata from\nshift register\nwrite configuration\npulse\noutput port \nregisterD Q\nCK write pulse\npolarity inversion\nregister\nD Q\nCKdata from\nshift register\nwrite polarity\npulseinput port \nregister\nD Q\nCK read pulseinput port \nregister data\npolarity inversion \nregister data\naaa-035813FFdata from\nshift register\nFF\nFF\nFFQ1\nQ2\nGND\nto INT100 k\nAt power-on reset, all registers return to default values.\nFig. 5.

Power-on reset\nWhen power (from 0 V) is applied to V CC and starts rising, an internal power-on reset holds the\nPCA9555 in a reset condition until V CC has reached V PORR . At that time, the reset condition is\nreleased and the PCA9555 registers and I²C-bus/SMBus state machine initializes to their default\nstates. After that, V CC must be lowered to below 0.2 V and back up to the operating voltage for a\npower-reset cycle. See Section 8.2.\n6.5.  Interrupt output\nAn interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode. After\ntime t v(INT) , the signal INT is valid. The interrupt is reset when data on the port changes back\nto the original value or when data is read form the port that generated the interrupt (see Fig. 9\nand Fig. 10 ). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge\n(NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK\nclock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Any\nchange of the I/Os after resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.\nA pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output to an\ninput may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the\nInput Port register.\n7.  Bus transactions\nThe PCA9555 is an I²C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and PCA9555\nthrough write and read commands using I²C-bus. The two communication lines are a serial data\nline (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be connected to a positive supply via a\npull-up resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data transfer may be initiated\nonly when the bus is not busy.\n7.1.  Writing to the port registers\nData is transmitted to the PCA9555 by sending the start condition, device address and setting the\nread-write bit to a logic 0 (see Fig. 3 ). The command byte is sent after the address and determines\nwhich register will receive the data following the command byte.\nEight registers within the PCA9555 are configured to operate as four register pairs. The four pairs\nare input port, output port, polarity inversion, configuration registers. After sending data to one\nregister, the next data byte is sent to the other register in the pair (see Fig. 6  and Fig. 7 ). For\nexample, if the first byte is sent to Output Port 1 (register 3), the next byte is stored in Output Port 0\n(register 2).\nThere is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this way, the\nhost can continuously update a register pair independently of the other registers, or the host can\nsimply update a single register.\nPCA9555 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2023.

Reading the port registers\nIn order to read data from the PCA9555, the bus master must first send the PCA9555 start\ncondition device address with the read-write bit set to a logic 0 (see Fig. 3 ). The command byte is\nsent after the address and determines which register will be accessed. After a start or restart, the\ndevice address is sent again, but this time the least significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the\nregister defined by the command byte is sent by the PCA9555 (see Fig. 8 , Fig. 9  and Fig. 10 ). Data\nis clocked into the register on the rising edge of the acknowledge clock pulse. After the first byte is\nread, additional bytes may be read but the data now reflects the information in the other register in\nthe pair. For example, if Input Port 1 is read, the next byte read is Input Port 0. There is no limit on\nthe number of data bytes received in one read transmission, but on the final byte received the bus\nmaster must not acknowledge the data.\nAfter a subsequent start or restart, the command byte contains the value of the next register to be\nread in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 was read last before the restart, the register that is\nread after the restart is the Input Port 0.\nA S\nSTART condition R/W\nacknowledge\nfrom slave\naaa-035815A\nacknowledge\nfrom slaveSDA\nA P\nacknowledge\nfrom masterDATA (first byte)slave address\nSTOP\nconditionS\n(repeated)\nSTART condition(cont.)\n(cont.)100A2 A1 A0 1A 0\nR/W\nacknowledge\nfrom slaveslave address\nat this moment master-transmitter becomes master-receiver\nand slave-receiver becomes slave-transmitterNA\nno acknowledge\nfrom master100A2 A1 A0 0 0\ndata from lower or \nupper byte of register\nLSB MSB\nDATA (last byte)data from upper or \nlower byte of register\nLSB MSB00000/1 0/1 0/1 0command byte\nRemark:  Transfer can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition.\nFig. 8.

Minimizing I CC when the I/Os are used to control LEDs\nWhen the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to V CC through a resistor as\nshown in Fig. 11. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/O VI is about 1.2 V less\nthan V CC. The supply current, I CC, increases as V I becomes lower than V CC.\nDesigns needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications, should\nconsider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to V CC when the LED is off. Fig. 12  shows a\nhigh value resistor in parallel with the LED. Fig. 13  shows V CC less than the LED supply voltage by\nat least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI at or above V CC and prevents additional\nsupply current consumption when the LED is off.\nPCA9555 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2023.

Power-on reset voltage (V POR)\n8.3.  Device current consumption with internal pull-up and pull-down\nresistors\nThe PCA9555 integrates pull-up resistors to eliminate external components when pins are\nconfigured as inputs and pull-up resistors are required (for example, nothing is driving the inputs to\nthe power supply rails. Since these pull-up resistors are internal to the device itself, they contribute\nto the current consumption of the device and must be considered in the overall system design.\nIf the resistor is configured as a pull-up, that is, connected to V CC, a current will flow from the V CC\npin through the resistor to ground when the pin is held LOW. This current will appear as additional\nICC upsetting any current consumption measurements.\nThe pull-up resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with voltage. The resistance\nspecification for these devices spans from 50 kΩ with a nominal 100 kΩ value. Any current\nflow through these resistors is additive by the number of pins held LOW and the current can be\ncalculated by Ohm’s law. See Fig. 19  for a graph of supply current versus the number of pull-up\nresistors.\n9.  Limiting values\nTable 13.
