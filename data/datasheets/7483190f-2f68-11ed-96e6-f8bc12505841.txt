This is a \nstress rating only; functional operation of the product at these or any other cond itions above those indicated in the operational \nsection of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may affec t product reliability.  \nTHERMAL DATA  \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually on ly, not in \ncombination. The ADM7172 can be damaged  when the junction \ntemperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperatu re \ndoes not guarantee that T J is within the specified temperature \nlimits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperatu re may \nneed to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and l ow \nprinted circuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit provided \nthat the junction temperature is within specification l imits. The \njunction temperature (T\nJ) of the device is dependent on the \nambient t emperature  (TA), the power dissipation of the device \n(PD), and the junction -to-ambient thermal resistance of the \npackage (θ JA). \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) using the \nformula  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \nJunction -to-ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4 -layer board. The \njunction -to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on \nthe application and board layout. In applications where high \nmaximum power dissipation exists, close attention to  thermal \nboard design is required.  The value of θ JA may vary, depending on PCB material,  layout, and \nenvironmental conditions. The specified values of θ JA are based \non a 4 -layer, 4  in. × 3 in.  circuit board. See JESD51 -7 and \nJESD51 -9 for detailed informat ion on the board construction. \nFor additional information, see the AN -617 Application Note , \nWafer Level Chip Scale Package . \nΨJB is the junction -to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith un its of °C/W . Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4 -layer board. The JESD51 -12, Guidelines for \nReporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , states \nthat thermal characterization parameters are not the same as \ntherma l resistances. Ψ JB measures the component power flowing \nthrough multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in \nthermal resistance, θ JB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths include \nconvection from the top of the package as well as radiation from \nthe package, factors that make ΨJB more useful in real -world \napplications . Maximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated  \nfrom the board temperature (T B) and power dissipation (P D) \nusing the  formula  \nTJ = TB + (PD × ΨJB) \nSee JESD51 -8 and JESD51- 12 for more detailed information \nabout ΨJB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE  \nθJA, θJC, and Ψ JB are specified for the worst -case conditions, that \nis, a device soldered in a circuit board for surface -mount \npackages.  \nTable 5.

D | Page 16 of 23 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM7172  is a low quiescent current, low dropout linear \nregulator that operates from 2.3 V to 6.5 V and provides up to \n2 A of load current. Drawing a low 4.8 mA of quiescent current (typical) at full load makes the ADM7172  ideal for portable \nequipment. Typical shutdown current consumption is 0.25 μA at room temperature. \nOptimized for use with small 4.7 μF ceramic capacitors, the \nADM7172  provides excellent transient performance. \nVOUT\nSENSE\nSSGNDCURRENT-LIMIT,\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\nSOFT STARTREFERENCE\nSHUTDOWN ENVIN\n12250-056 \nFigure 55. Internal Block Diagram \nInternally, the ADM7172  consists of a reference, an error amplifier, \na feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. Output current is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies the difference. When the feedback voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower, \nallowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltage. \nWhen the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing less current to pass and decreasing the output voltage. The ADM7172  is available in 17 fixed output voltage options, \nranging from 1.2 V to 5 V . The ADM7172  architecture allows \nany fixed output voltage to be set to a higher voltage with an external voltage divider. For example, a fixed 5 V output ADM7172  \ncan be set to a 6 V output according to the following equation: \nV\nOUT = 5 V(1 + R1/R2) \nVOUT\nSENSEVINADM7172\nGNDVIN VOUT\nSSCSS\n1nFCIN\n4.7µFCOUT\n4.7µF\nEN\nOFFONVIN = 6.5V VOUT = 6.0V\nR1\n2kΩ\nR210kΩ\n12250-057 \nFigure 56. Typical Adjustable Output Voltage Application Schematic \nUse a value of less than 200 kΩ for R2 to minimize errors in the \noutput voltage caused by the SENSE pin input current. For \nexample, when R1 and R2 each equal 200 kΩ and the default output voltage is 1.2 V , the adjusted output voltage is 2.4 V . The output voltage error introduced by the SENSE pin input current is 0.1 mV or 0.004%, assuming a typical SENSE pin input bias current of 1 nA at 25°C. \nThe ADM7172  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT \npins under normal operating conditions. When EN is high, V\nOUT \nturns on; when EN is low, V OUT turns off. For automatic startup, \ntie EN to VIN (Pin 7 or Pin 8). \n \nData Sheet  ADM7172  \n \nRev.

ADIsimP ower  is a collection of tools that produce complete \npower designs optimized for a specific design goal. The tools \nenable the user to generate a full schematic, bill of materials, and calculate performance in minutes. ADIsimPower  can \noptimize designs for cost, area, efficiency, and device count, taking into consideration the operating conditions and limitations  \nof the IC and all real external components. For mo re information  \nabout, and to obta in ADIsimPower  design tools, visit \nwww.analog.com/ADIsimPower . \nCAPACITOR SELECTION  \nMultilay er ceramic capacitors (MLCC) comb ine small size, low \neffective series resistance (ESR), low ESL, and wide operating temperature range, making them an ideal choice for bypass capacitors. They are not without limitations, however. Depending \non the di electric  material, the capacitance can va ry dramatically \nwith temperature, dc bias, and ac signal level. Therefore, selecting \nthe proper capacitor results in the best circuit performance.  \nOutput Capacitor  \nThe ADM7172 is designed for op eration with small, space -\nsaving ceramic capacitors but functions with most commonly \nused capacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the ESR \nvalue. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the LDO co ntrol loop. A minimum of 4.7 µF c apacitance with an \nESR of 0.05 Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability of the ADM7172.  Transient response to changes in l oad current is also \naffected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADM7172 to \nlarge changes in load current. Figure 57 shows the transient \nresponses for an output capacitance value of 4.7 µF.  \n12250-058CH1  500mV BWCH2  2.0mV BWM1.0µs A  CH1      950mA\nT  12.4%T\n1\n2\n \nFigure 57. Output Transient Response, V OUT = 5 V, C OUT = 4.7 µF  \n Input Bypass Capacitor  \nConnecting a 4.7 µF capacitor fr om VIN to GND reduces the \ncircuit sensitivity to PCB layout, especially when long input traces or a high source impedance is encountered. If greater \nthan 4.7 µF of output capacitance is required, increase the input \ncapacitor  to match it.  \nInput and Output C apacitor Properties  \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the \nADM7172 if they meet the minimum capacitance and maximum  \nESR requirements. Ceramic ca pacitors are manufactured with a \nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature \nand applied voltage. Capacitors require a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary temperature range and dc bias conditio ns. X5R or X7R dielectrics with  a \nvoltage rating of 6.3 V to 100 V are recommended. Y5V and \nZ5U dielectrics are not recommended, due to their poor temperatu re and dc bias characteristics.  \nFigure 58 depicts the capacitance vs. dc bias voltage of a 0805, \n4.7 µF, 16 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is \nstrongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In \ngeneral, a capacitor  in a larger package or higher voltage rating \nexhibits better stability. The temperature varia tion of the X5R \ndielectric is ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and is not a function of package or voltage rating.

D | Page 18 of 23 The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed to be 10%, and \nCBIAS is 4.35 μF at 3.0 V , as shown in Figure 58. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields  \nCEFF = 4.35 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 3.33 μF  \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temper -\nature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage  of 3.0 V .  \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADM7172, it is imperative \nthat the effects of dc bias, temperature, and tol erances on the \nbehavior of the capacitors be evaluated for each application.  \nPROGRAMMABLE PRECISI ON ENABLE  \nThe ADM7172 uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT \npins under normal operating  conditions. As shown in Figure 59, \nwhen a rising voltage on EN crosses the upper threshold, typically 1.2 V , V\nOUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN crosses the \nlower threshold, typically 1.1 V , V OUT turns off . The hysteresis of \nthe EN threshold is approximately 100  m V.

Typical V OUT Response to EN Pin Operation  \nThe upper and lower thresholds are user programmable and can be set higher than the nominal 1.2 V threshold by using  two \nresistors.

This prevent s \non/off oscillations that can occur due to noise on the EN pin as \nit passes through the threshold points.  \nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT  \nThe ADM 7172  also incorporates an internal undervoltage \nlockout circuit to disable the output voltage when the input \nvoltage is less than the minimum input voltage rating of the regulator. The up per and lower thresholds are internally fixed \nwith about 200 mV of h ysteresis. This hysteresis prevents on/off \noscillations that can occur when caused by noise on the input voltage as it passes through the threshold points.  \nSOFT START  \nThe ADM7172 uses an intern al soft start (SS pin open) to limit the \ninrush current  when the output is enabled. The start -up time for \nthe 5.0  V option is approximately 380  μs from the time the EN \nactive threshold is c rossed to when the output reaches 90% of its \nfinal value. As shown in Figure 61, the start- up time is nearly \nindependent of the output voltage setting.

Typical Soft Start Behavior, Different C SS Values  \nNOIS E REDUCTION OF THE ADM7172  IN \nADJUSTABLE MODE  \nThe ultralow output noise of the ADM7172 is achieved by \nkeeping the LDO error amplif ier in unity gain and  setting the \nreference voltage equal to the output voltage. This architecture does \nnot work for an adjustable output voltage LDO in the conventional \nsense. However, t he ADM7 172 architecture allo ws any fixed \noutput voltage to be set to a higher voltage with an external voltag e \ndivider. For example, the adjustable (1.2 V in unity gain) output ADM7172 can be set to a 6 V output according to the following \nequation:  \nV\nOUT = 1.2 V (1 + R1 /R2) \nThe disadvantage of using the ADM7172 in this manner is that \nthe output voltage noise is proportional to the output vo ltage . \nTherefore, it is best to choose a fixed output voltage that is close to the target voltage to minimize the increase in output noise.  \nThe adjustable LDO circuit can be modified to reduce the output  \nvoltage noise to levels close to that of the fixed o utput  ADM7172 . \nThe circuit shown in Figure 63 adds two additional components \nto the output voltage setting resistor divider. C\nNR and R NR are \nadded in p aralle l with R FB1 to reduce the ac gain of the error \namplifier. R NR is chosen to be sm all with respect to R FB2. If R NR is \n1% to 10% of the value of R FB2, the minimum ac gain of the \nerror amplifier is approximately 0.1 dB to 0.8 dB. The actual \ngain is deter mined by the parallel combination of R NR and R FB1. \nThis ensures that the error amplifier always operates at slightly \ngreater than unity gain.  CNR is chosen by setting the reactance of C NR equal to R FB1 − R NR \nat a frequency between 0.5 Hz and 10 Hz. This sets the frequency where the ac gain of the error amplifier is 3 dB less than its dc gai n. \nVOUT\nSENSEVINADM7172\nGNDVIN VOUT\nSSCSS\n1nFCIN\n4.7µFCOUT\n4.7µFCNR\n1µF\nEN\nOFFONVIN = 6.5V VOUT = 6.0V\nRFB1\n200kΩ\nRFB2\n50kΩRNR\n5kΩ\n12250-064 \nFigure 63. Noise Reduction Modification  \nAssuming the noise of a fixed output LDO is a pproximately \n5 μV , identify the noise of the adjustable LDO by using the \nfollowing formula:  \nNoise  = 5 μV × ( RPAR + RFB2)/RFB2 \nwhere RPAR is the parallel combination of R FB1 and RNR. \nBased on the component values shown in Figure 63, the \nADM7172 has the following characteristics:  \n• DC gain of 5 (14 dB)  \n• 3 dB roll -off frequency of 0.8 Hz  \n• High frequency ac gain of 1.09 (0.75 dB)  \n• Noise reduction factor of 4.42 ( 12.91 dB)  \n• RMS noise of the adjustable LDO without noise reduction of 25  µV rms  \n• RMS noise of the adjustable LDO with noise reduction \n(assuming 5 µV rms for fixed voltage option) of 5.5 µV rms  \nEFFECT OF NOISE RE DUCTION ON START -UP TIME  \nThe start -up time of t he ADM7172 is affected by the noise \nreduction network and must  be considered in applications \nwhere power supply sequencing is critical.  \nThe noise r eduction circuit adds a pole in the feedback l oop, \nslowing down the start -up time. The start -up time for an \nadjustable model with  a noise reduction network can be \napproximated using the following equation:  \nSSNR TIME (sec) = 5.5 × C NR × (RNR + RFB1) \nFor a C NR, RNR, and RFB1 combination of 1 µF, 5 k Ω, and 200 kΩ  \nas shown in Figure 61, the start -up time is approximately 1.1 s ec. \nWhen SSNR TIME is greater than SSTIME, SSNR TIME dictate s the \nlength of the start- up time instead of the soft start capacitor.  \nADM7172  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 20 of 23 CURRENT -LIMIT AND TH ERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION  \nThe ADM7172 is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by current -limit and thermal overload protection  \ncircuits. The ADM7172 is designed to current limit when the \noutput load reaches 3 A (typical). When the output load exceeds \n3 A, the output voltage is reduced to maintain a constant current limit.  \nThermal overl oad protectio n is included, which limits the \njunction temperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and/or high power dissipation) when the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C, the outp ut is turned of f, reducing the output \ncurrent to zero. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again, and the output current is restored to its operating value.  \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground occur s. At first, th e ADM7172 current limits, so that only 3 A  is \nconducted into the short. If self heating of the junction is great enough to cause its temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal shutd own activate s, turning off the output and reducing the output \ncurrent to zero. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 3 A into the \nshort, again causing the junction temperature to rise above \n150°C. This th ermal oscillation between 135°C and 150°C \ncauses a current oscillation between 3 A and 0  mA that  \ncontinues for as long as the short remains at the output.  \nCurrent -limit and thermal limit protections are intended to \nprotect the device against accidental ove rload conditions. For \nreliable operation, device power dissipation must be externally \nlimited so that the junction temperature does not exceed 125°C.  \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIO NS \nIn applications with low input -to-output voltage differential, the \nADM7172 does not dissipate much heat. However, in applications  \nwith high ambient temperature and/or high input voltage , the heat \ndissipated in the package may become large enough that it causes \nthe junction te mperature of the die to exceed the maximum \njunction temperature of 125°C.  \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction temper ature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent  \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is very important to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of \nthe ambient temperature of the environment and the temperature  \nrise o f the package due to the power dissipation, as shown in \nEquation 2.  To guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the \nADM7172 must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction \ntemperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be \naware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature \nchanges.  These parameters include ambient temperature, power \ndissipation  in the power device , and thermal resistances between \nthe jun ction  and ambient ai r (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent \non the package  assembly compounds that are used and the  \namount of copper used to solder the package GND pin to the PCB.  \nTable 7 shows typical θ JA values of the 8 -lead LFCSP pack age for \nvarious PCB copper sizes. The typical value of Ψ JB is 15.1°C/W for \nthe 8 -lead LFCSP package.  \nTable 7.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to the following:  \nT\nJ = TA + (((V IN − VOUT) × I LOAD) × θJA) (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given  ambient temperature , input -\nto-output voltage differential,  and continuous  load current, a \nminimum copper size requirement  exists for the PCB to ensure \nthat the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C.
