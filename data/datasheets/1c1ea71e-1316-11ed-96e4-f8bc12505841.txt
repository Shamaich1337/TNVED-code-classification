Each switch conducts equally well in \nboth directions when on. PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Low on resistance (0.25 Ω typical). \n2. 1.8 V to 5.5 V single-supply operation. \n3. Tiny 6-lead SOT-23 and 8-lead MSOP packages. \n4. 400 mA current-carrying capability. \n5. Automotive temperature range from −40°C to +125°C. \n6. Pin compatible with ADG701  (ADG801 ) and ADG702  \n(ADG802 ). \n \n \nADG801/ADG802 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

**Description of the Component:**
The ADG801BRTZ-REEL7 is a monolithic CMOS single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switch designed for low on-resistance and high-speed switching applications. It features a maximum on-resistance of 0.4 Ω at 125°C, making it suitable for applications where minimal signal loss is critical. The switch is normally open (NO) and can conduct equally well in both directions when activated.

**Typical Applications:**
The ADG801BRTZ-REEL7 is commonly used in various applications, including:
- **Power Routing:** Efficiently directing power to different components in a circuit.
- **Cellular Phones:** Managing signal paths for communication.
- **Modems and Data Acquisition Systems:** Facilitating data transfer and signal processing.
- **PCMCIA Cards and Hard Drives:** Enabling connections and data flow in portable devices.
- **Relay Replacement:** Serving as a solid-state alternative to mechanical relays.
- **Battery-Powered Systems:** Its low power consumption makes it ideal for battery-operated devices.

This component is particularly valuable in automotive and portable electronic applications due to its robust performance across a wide temperature range and low power requirements.
