The most common failure mode is a short \ncircuit. In case a short circuit occurs, ensure safety by fully considering the followings.\n(a) If POSCAP emit smoke, turn off the main power of the equipment. In this case, keep your face and\n hands away from the area.\n(b) It may take a few seconds to a few minutes before POSCAP emits smoke by the situation. Increase\n safety by using a protective circuit.\n(c) If the smoke comes into eyes, rinse immediately. If the smoke is inhaled, gargle immediately.\n(d) In case a large current continues to flow after a short circuit, in the worst case, the shorted-out\n section may ignite. For safety, install a redundant circuit or a protective circuit, etc.\n1.2-2 Wear-out failure (lifetime)\nWhen lifetime exceeded the specified guarantee time of Endurance and Damp heat, electrolyte might\ninsulate and cause electric characteristic changed. This is called an open circuit. The rated capacitance \nvalues and the electrical characteristics values such as ESR specified in the characteristics list are factory \ndefault values. Please carefully design a circuit since rated capacitance values and the electrical \ncharacteristics values may change (increase) beyond the specified values under the conditions of rated \nvoltage/temperature and electrical/mechanical performances.\n1.3 Reduction of failure stress\nWhen POSCAP is used within the rated voltage, it shows a stable characteristic, but it may be damagedin a short circuit when an overvoltage, for instance, is applied. The time to reach the failure mode can beextended by using POSCAP with reduced environment temperature, ripple current and applied voltage.\nFailure rate\n・ In the case of the endurance which is 105 °C 2000 h.\n0.5 %/1000 h (Environment temp. : 105 °C, Rated voltage or Category voltage applied)\n・ In the case of the endurance which is 105 °C 1000 h or 125 °C 1000 h.\n1.0 %/1000 h (Environment temp. : 105 °C, Rated voltage or Category voltage applied)\n・ In the case of the endurance which is 85 °C 1000 h.\n1.0 %/1000 h (Environment temp. : 85 °C, Rated voltage applied)\n1.4 Check the rated performance\nAfter checking the operation and installation environments, design the circuit so that it falls within the rated\nperformance range stipulated in this delivery specification.\n1.5 Operating temperature and ripple current\n(1) Set the operating temperature so that it falls within the range stipulated in this delivery specification.(2) Do not apply current that exceeds the allowable ripple current. Ripple current should be controlled so that\n\u3000surface temperature of a capacitor do not exceed the rated temperature.\n(For questions regarding TQC series, please contact us.)\n(3) The ESR values specified in the characteristics list are factory default values.\nESR values may change (increase) beyond the specified values depending on the customer\'s use conditions.\n11-Mar-20\u3000\u3000Application Guidelines（POSCAP）\n 1. Circuit design\n\nConductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitors\n1.6 Leakage current\nEven when the soldering conditions fall within the range of this delivery specifications, leakage current\nincreases a little on occasion. It also increases a little during high temperature storage, high humidity storage\nこand temperature cycling with no voltage applied. In cases such as these, leakage current will decrease by\napplying voltage under the condition of below the POSCAP\'s maximum operating temperature.\nThe speed at which the leakage current is restored is increased by applying voltage when the POSCAP\'s\ntemperature is close to the maximum operating temperature.\n1.7 Rapid charge and discharge limitation\nRapid charge and discharge are restricted (for maintainance of high-proof reliability).\nA protective circuit is recommended for when a rapid charge or discharge causes excessive rush current\nsince this is main cause of short circuit and large leakage current. Use a protective circuits in case the rush\ncurrent value exceeds 20 A*.\nBe sure to insert a protection resistor of about 1 kΩ for charge and discharge when measuring the leakage \ncurrent.* When TH series use under the ambient temperature more than 105 °C : 10 A, TPU series : 10 A\n2.1 Protect circuit\nThe failure mode of POSCAP is the short mode. When it breaks down, short electric current flows to it.\nPOSCAP gives off heat by this short current.\nDo the following consideration in design fully for the safety because it has a bad influence on the part around\nPOSCAP due to this heat.\n・ A protective circuit and a protective device are set up, so as to make the system safer.\n・ A diffuse circuit and so on is set up, so as to make the system safer such as that a machine may not\n  break down as to the single trouble.\n2.2 Considerations when soldering\nThe soldering conditions are to be within the range prescribed in this delivery specification.\nIf the specifications are not followed, there is the possibility of degradation of electric characteristic and\nlifetime when soldering is conducted under conditions that are harsher that those stipulated.\n2.3 Others\nPOSCAP’s Electrical characteristics are affected by temperature and frequency fluctuations.\nDesign circuits after checking the amount of fluctuation.\nIt is necessary to set an environment to prevent a trouble at the time of soldering by the degradation of solder\nability or moisture\'s getting into the molding resin when POSCAP are stored.\n● Please make storage of POSCAP sealing up in the reel and storage bag at the time of delivery in the following\nenvironment. Also, set storage period of unopened as 18 months or shorter after shipment from factory.\n・ Room temperature and room humidity (generally : 15 to 35 °C, 45 to 75% RH ) are desirable.\n・ Place where POSCAP is not exposed by direct sunshine.\n● Please unseal storage bag just before mounting and use up POSCAP in the storage bag.\nPOSCAP is not compatible with JEDEC J-STD-020, J-STD-033\n✽ Intellectual property right\nWe, Panasonic Group are providing the product and service that customers can use without anxiety, and areworking positively on the protection of our products under intellectual property rights.\nRepresentative patents relating to POSCAP are as follows:\nUS Patent No.6508800, No.6891717, No.7158368, No.7326260号, No.8081421, No.8149569,\nNo.8456804, No.8559166\n11-Mar-20Floor life\nConditions\n≦ 30 ℃ / 60 %RH\n≦ 30 ℃ / 60 %RH\n≦ 30 ℃ / 60 %RHTime\n4 weeks\n168 hours\n48 hours3\n5 2.
