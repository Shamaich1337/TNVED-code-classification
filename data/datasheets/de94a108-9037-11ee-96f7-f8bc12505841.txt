A spot heater can heat up a \ncapacitor uniformly with a small heat gradient which leads to lower thermal  \nstress caused by quick heating and cooling or localized heating.  \nMoreover, where ultra-small capacitors are mounted close together on a printed \ncircuit board, reworking with a spot heater can eliminate the risk of direct contact \nbetween the tip of a soldering iron and a capacitor.  \n \nRework condition  \nIf the blower nozzle of a spot heater is too close to a capacitor , a crack in the \ncapacitor may occur due to heat stress. Below are recommendations for avoiding \nsuch an occurrence.  \nKeep more than 5mm between a capacitor and a spot heater nozz le. \nThe blower temperature of the spot heater shall be lower than 400° C. \nThe airflow shall be set as weak as possible.  \nThe diameter of the nozzle is recommended to be 2mm(one-outlet type).The size \nis standard and common.  \nDuration of blowing hot air is recommended to be 10s or less for CGA3 (CC0603), \nCGA4 (CC0805) and CGA5 (CC1206) , and 30s or less for  CGA6 (CC1210), \nCGA8(CC1812) and CGA9 (CC2220) , considering surface area of the capacitor \nand melting temperature of solder.  \nThe angle between the nozzle and t he capacitor is recommended to be \n45degrees in order to work easily and to avoid partial area heating.  \nAs is the case when using a soldering iron, preheating reduces thermal stress on \ncapacitors and improves operating efficiency.  \n \n・Recommended rework condition （Consult the component manufactures for details. ） \n    Distance from nozzle  5mm and over   \nNozzle angle  45degrees  \nNozzle temp.  400°C and less  \nAirflow Set as weak as possible  \n(The airflow shall be the minimum value necessary for \nsolder to melt in the  conditions mentioned above.)  \nNozzle diameter  φ2mm（one-outlet type）  \nBlowing duration  10s and less  (CGA3 [CC0603], CGA4 [CC0805], CGA5 [CC1206] ) \n30s and less  (CGA6 [CC1210], CGA8 [CC1812], CGA9 [CC2220] ) \n    \n・Example of recommended spot heater use  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  3) \n Amount of solder should be suitable to from a proper fillet shape.  \nExcess solder causes mechanical and thermal stress on a capacitor and results \nin cracks.

Excessive washing \n When ultrasonic cleaning equipment is used, excessive ultrasonic power or \ndirect vibration transfer to a printed wiring board may generate a resonant \nvibration in the board. This may cause a crack in a capacitor or its solder joints \nto the board and degradation in the terminal strength of the capacitor. In order \nto avoid this, the following cleaning conditions are recommended.  \nPower : 20 W/  ℓ max.  \nFrequency : 40 kHz max.  \nWashing time : 5 minutes max.  \n2)-3.

E ACaution  2) Printed circuit board cropping should not be carried out by hand, but by using the \nproper tooling. Printed circuit board cropping should be carried out using a board \ncropping jig as shown in the following figure or a board cropping apparatus to \nprevent inducing mechanical stress on the board.  \n   (1)Example of a board cropping jig  \nRecommended example: The board should be pushed from the back side, \nclose to the cropping jig so t hat the board is not bent and the stress applied to \nthe capacitor is compressive.  \nUnrecommended example: If the pushing point is far from the cropping jig and \nthe pushing direction is from the front side of the board, large tensile stress is \napplied to the capacitor, which may cause cracks.  \nOutline of jig  Recommended  Unrecommended   \n  \n   \n (2)Example of a board cropping machine  \nAn outline of a printed circuit board cropping machine is shown below. The  \ntop and bottom blades are aligned with one another along the lines with the  \nV-grooves on printed circuit board when cropping the board.  \nUnrecommended example: Misalignment of blade position between top and \nbottom, right and left, or front and rear blades may cause a crack in the \ncapacitor.  \n \nOutline of machine                   Principle of operation  \n Recommended Unrecommended  \n Top-bottom  \nmisalignment  Left-right \nmisalignment  Front -rear \nmisalignment  \n  \nTop blade  \n \n \nBoard  \n \n \n \n \n \nBottom blade   \n \nTop blade  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBottom blade  \nTop blade  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBottom blade   \nTop blade  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBottom blade  \n   Printed\n  \ncircuit  \nboard \nV-groove \nSlot \nBoard  \ncropping jig  \n \nCross -section \n \nPrinted circuit board  \nV-groove \n Bottom blade  \nTop blade  \nPrinted circuit board  \nTop  \nblade  \nV-groove \n Bottom blade  \nTop blade  \nPrinted circuit board  \n \nPrinted  \ncircuit  \nboard  \nSlot \n V-groove \nLoad point  \nComponents  \nDirection of  \nload \nDirection  \nof load  \nComponents  \nPrinted  \ncircuit  \nboard  \nLoad point  \nSlot \nV-groove \nAC1101001 1 \n— 27 —  \nNo. Process  Condition  \n9 Handling after  \nchip mounted \n△ ! E ACaution  3) When functional check of the P.C.board is performed, check pin pressure tends  \nto be adjusted higher for fear of loose contact. But if the pressure is excessive  \nand bend the P.C.board, it may crack the chip capacitors or peel the terminations  \noff. Please adjust the check pins not to bend the P.C.board.  \n   \nItem Not recommended Recommended  \nBoard \nbending    \n \n10 Handling of loose \nchip capacitors  1) If dropped the chip capacitors may crack. Once dropped do not use it.

They may not be  used in \nprecision time constant circuit. In case of the time constant circuit, the evaluation \nshould be done well.  \n12 Estimated life and  \nestimated failure \nrate of capacitors  As per the estimated life and the estimated failure rate depend on the temperature  \nand the voltage.  This can be calculated by the equation described in JEITA  \nRCR-2335C  Annex  F (Informative) Calculation of the estimated lifetime and the \nestimated failure rate ( Voltage acceleration coefficient  : 3 multiplication rule, \nTemperature acceleration coefficient : 10°C  rule) \nThe failure rate can be decreased by reducing the temperature and the voltage but  \nthey will not be guaranteed.  \n  \nCrack  \nFloor \nP.C.board  \nCrack  \nCheck pin  \nTermination  \npeeling  \nSupport pin  \nCheck pin  \nAC1101001 1 \n— 28 —  \nNo. Process  Condition  \n13 Caution during  \noperation of  \nequipment  1) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2) \n \n \n \n \n \n3) A capacitor shall not be touched directly with bare hands during operation in \norder to avoid electric shock.  \nElectric energy held by the capacitor may be discharged through the human \nbody when touched with a bare hand.  \nEven when the equipment is off, a capacitor may stay charged.
