It operates in con tinuous PWM mode.  \n \nThe AP3409/A integrates synchronous P -channel and N -channel \npower MOSFET switches with low on -resistance. It is ideal for \nportable applications powered from a single Li -ion battery. 100% duty \ncycle and low on -resistance P -channel interna l power MOSFET can \nmaximize the battery life.  \n \nThe switching frequency of AP3409/A can be programmable from \n300kHz to 4MHz, which allows small -sized components, such as \ncapacitors and inductors. A standard series of inductors from several \ndifferent manufac turers are available. This feature greatly simplifies \nthe design of switch -mode power supplies.  \n \nThe AP3409/A is available in U-DFN3030 -10 package.  \n \nFeatures  \n \n\uf0b7 Input Voltage Range: 2.6 V to 5.5V   \n\uf0b7 Adjustable Output from 0.8 V to 5V  \n\uf0b7 0.8V Reference Vol tage with ±  2% Precision  \n\uf0b7 Output Current: 3A  \n\uf0b7 High Efficiency up to 95%  \n\uf0b7 Low R DSON  Internal Switches  \n\uf0b7 Programmable Frequency: 300kHz to 4MHz  \n\uf0b7 Current Mode Control   \n\uf0b7 Forced Continuous -mode Operation  \n\uf0b7 100% Duty Cycle  \n\uf0b7 Built-in Soft -start \n\uf0b7 Built-in Short Circuit Prote ction  \n\uf0b7 Built-in Thermal Shutdown Protection  \n\uf0b7 Built-in Current Limit Function  \n\uf0b7 PGOOD Output Voltage Monitoring (For AP3409A)  \n\uf0b7 U-DFN3030 -10 package  \n\uf0b7 Totally Lead -free & Fully RoHS Compliant (Note  1 & 2) \n\uf0b7 Halogen and Antimony Free. “Green” Device (Note 3)  \n \n \n  Pin Assignments  \n \n(Top View)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU-DFN3030 -10 (DN Package)  \nFor AP3409  \n \n \n \n(Top View)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU-DFN3030 -10 (DN Package)  \nFor AP3409A  \n \n \n  \nApplications  \n \n\uf0b7 Portable Media Player  \n\uf0b7 Digital Still and Video Cameras  \n\uf0b7 Notebook  \n \nNote s: 1.

**Description:**
The AP3409DNTR-G1 is a high-efficiency synchronous buck DC/DC converter designed to deliver up to 3A of output current. It operates in continuous PWM mode and integrates both P-channel and N-channel power MOSFETs with low on-resistance, making it suitable for portable applications powered by a single Li-ion battery. The device features a programmable switching frequency, allowing for the use of smaller passive components, which simplifies the design of switch-mode power supplies.

**Typical Applications:**
- Portable Media Players
- Digital Still and Video Cameras
- Notebooks
- Other battery-powered devices requiring efficient voltage regulation

This component is particularly advantageous in applications where space is limited and efficiency is critical, such as in consumer electronics and mobile devices. Its built-in protections and features enhance reliability and performance in various operating conditions.
