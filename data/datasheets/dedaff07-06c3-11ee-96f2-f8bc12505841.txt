A cermet film  \nlayer and a glass-over are deposited on a high grade (AI 2O3) \nceramic substrate with its pre pared inner contacts on both  \nsides. A special laser is used to achieve the target value and  \nthe desired power dissipation performance by smoothly fine  \ntrimming the resistive layer without damaging the ceramics.  \nThe resistor elements are covered by a protective coating  \ndesigned for electrical, mechanical and climatic protection.  \nThe terminations receive a fina l pure matte tin on nickel  \nplating.The result of the determined production is verified by an  \nextensive testing procedure on 100 % of the individual chip  \nresistors. Only accepted product s are laid directly into the  \ntape in accordance with IEC 60286-3 Type 1a \n(1).\nASSEMBLY\nThe resistors are suitable for processing on automatic SMD  \nassembly systems. They are suitable for automatic  \nsoldering using wave, reflow or vapor phase as shown in  \nIEC 61760-1 . The encapsulation is resistant to all cleaning  \nsolvents commonly used in the electronics industry,  \nincluding alcohols, esters and aqueous solutions. The  \nsuitability of conformal coatings potting compounds and  \ntheir processes, if applied, sh all be qualified by appropriate  \nmeans to ensure the long-te rm stability of the whole system.\nThe resistors are RoHS-compliant, the pure matte tin plating  \nprovides compatibility with  lead (Pb)-free and  \nlead-containing soldering processes. Solderability is  \nspecified for 2 years after produ ction or requalification. The  \npermitted storage time is 20 years. The immunity of the  \nplating against tin whisker gr owth has been proven under  \nextensive testing.\nMATERIALS\nVishay acknowledges the following systems for the  \nregulation of hazardous substances:• IEC 62474, Material Declaration for Products of and for the  \nElectrotechnical Industry, with the list of declarable  \nsubstances given therein \n(2)\n• The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List  \n(GADSL) (3)\n• The REACH regulation (1907/2006/EC) and the related list  \nof substances with very high concern (SVHC) (4) for its  \nsupply chainThe products do not contain any of the banned  \nsubstances as per IEC 62474, GADSL, or the SVHC list,  \nsee www.vishay.com/how/leadfree .\nHence the products fully comply with the following  \ndirectives:• 2000/53/EC End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (ELV) and  \nAnnex II (ELV II)\n• 2011/65/EU Restriction of the Use of Hazardous  \nSubstances Directive (RoHS) with amendment  \n2015/863/EU\n• 2012/19/EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment  \nDirective (WEEE)\nVishay pursues the elimination of conflict minerals from its  \nsupply chain, see the Conflict Minerals Policy at  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?49037\n.\nAPPROVALS\nThe resistors are qualified according to AEC-Q200.Where applicable, the resistors are tested in accordance  \nwith EN 140401-802  which refers to EN 60115-1 , \nEN 60115-8  and the variety of environmental test  \nprocedures of the IEC 60068 \n(1) series.\nRELATED PRODUCTS\nFor more information about pro ducts with superior surge  \nand pulse performance please  refer to D/CRCW-IF e3,  \nPulse Proof Thick Film Ch ip Resistors datasheet  \n(www.vishay.com/doc?20024 ).\nThe CRCW-HP e3 product seri es is designed for those  \napplications where both enhanced power rating and  \nsuperior pulse loading performance is required.  \nFor ordering CRCW-HP e3 please refer to latest edition of  \ndatasheet ( www.vishay.com/doc?20043 ).\nFor thick film resistors with standard requirements for power  \nrating, please refer to D/CRCW  e3, Standard Thick Film Chip  \nResistors datasheet ( www.vishay.com/doc?20035 )\nNotes\n(1)The quoted IEC standards are also released as EN standards with the same number and identical contents\n(2)The IEC 62474 list of declarable subs tances is maintained in  a dedicated database, which is available at http://std.iec.ch/iec62474 .\n(3)The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL) is maintained by the American Chemistry Council and available at www.gadsl.org\n(4)The SVHC list is maintained by the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) and available at http://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table\nRCS e3\nwww.vishay.comVishay  \n \nRevision: 04-Jul-2022 5 Document Number: 20065\nFor technical questions, contact: thickfilmchip@vishay.com\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
