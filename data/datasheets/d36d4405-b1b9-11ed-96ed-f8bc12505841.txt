LUT-based logic \nprovides optimized performance and efficiency for data-path, register intensive, mathematical, or digital signal processing (DSP) designs, while \nEABs implement RAM, ROM, dual-port RAM, or first-in first-out (FIFO) \nfunctions. These elements make ACEX 1K suitable for complex logic functions and memory functions such as digital signal processing, wide \ndata-path manipulation, data transformation and microcontrollers, as \nrequired in high-performance communications applications. Based on reconfigurable CMOS SRAM elements, the ACEX 1K architecture \nincorporates all features necessary to implement common gate array \nmegafunctions, along with a high pin count to enable an effective interface with system components. The advanced process and the low voltage \nrequirement of the 2.5-V core allow ACEX 1K devices to meet the \nrequirements of low-cost, high-volume applications ranging from DSL \nmodems to low-cost switches.\nThe ability to reconfigure ACEX 1K devices enables complete testing prior \nto shipment and allows the designer to focus on simulation and design \nverification. ACEX 1K device reconfigurability eliminates inventory management for gate array designs and test vector generation for fault \ncoverage.\nTable 4  shows ACEX 1K device performance for some common designs. \nAll performance results were obtained with Synopsys DesignWare or LPM functions. Special design techniques are not required to implement \nthe applications; the designer simply infers or instantiates a function in a \nVerilog HDL, VHDL, Altera Hardware Description Language (AHDL), or schematic design file.\nNotes:\n(1) This application uses combinatorial inputs and outputs.\n(2) This application uses registered inputs and outputs.Table 4.

The \nembedded array is used to implement a variety of memory functions or \ncomplex logic functions, such as digital signal processing (DSP), wide \ndata-path manipulation, microcontroller applications, and data-\ntransformation functions. The logic array performs the same function as \nthe sea-of-gates in the gate array and is used to implement general logic such as counters, adders, state machines, and multiplexers. The \ncombination of embedded and logic arrays provides the high \nperformance and high density of embedded gate arrays, enabling designers to implement an entire system on a single device.\nACEX 1K devices are configured at system power-up with data stored in \nan Altera serial configuration device or provided by a system controller. \nAltera offers EPC16, EPC2, EPC1, and EPC1441 configuration devices, \nwhich configure ACEX 1K devices via a serial data stream. Configuration \ndata can also be downloaded from system RAM or via the Altera \nMasterBlaster\nTM, ByteBlasterMVTM, or BitBlasterTM download cables. After \nan ACEX 1K device has been configured, it can be reconfigured in-circuit \nby resetting the device and loading new data. Because reconfiguration \nrequires less than 40 ms, real-time changes can be made during system operation.\nACEX 1K devices contain an interface that permits microprocessors to \nconfigure ACEX 1K devices serially or in parallel, and synchronously or \nasynchronously. The interface also enables microprocessors to treat an ACEX 1K device as memory and configure it  by writing to a virtual \nmemory location, simplifying device reconfiguration.Table 5.

The software \nprovides EDIF 2 0 0 and 3 0 0, LPM, VHDL, Verilog HDL, and other interfaces for additional design entry and simulation support from other \nindustry-standard PC- and UNIX workstation-based EDA tools. \nThe Altera software works easily with common gate array EDA tools for \nsynthesis and simulation. For example, the Altera software can generate Verilog HDL files for simulation with tools such as Cadence Verilog-XL. \nAdditionally, the Altera software contains EDA libraries that use device-\nspecific features such as carry chains, which are used for fast counter and arithmetic functions. For instance, the Synopsys Design Compiler library \nsupplied with the Altera development system includes DesignWare \nfunctions that are optimized for the ACEX 1K device architecture. \nThe Altera development systems run on Windows-based PCs and Sun \nSPARCstation, and HP 9000 Series 700/800 workstations.\nfFor more information, see the MAX+PLUS II Programmable Logic \nDevelopment System & Software Data Sheet  and the Quartus Programmable \nLogic Development System & Software Data Sheet .\nFunctional \nDescriptionEach ACEX 1K device contains an enhanced embedded array that \nimplements memory and specialized logic functions, and a logic array that implements general logic.\nThe embedded array consists of a series of EABs. When implementing \nmemory functions, each EAB provides 4,096 bits, which can be used to \ncreate RAM, ROM, dual-port RAM, or first-in first-out (FIFO) functions. When implementing logic, each EAB can contribute 100 to 600 gates \ntowards complex logic functions such as multipliers, microcontrollers, \nstate machines, and DSP functions. EABs can be used independently, or multiple EABs can be combined to implement larger functions.\nAltera Corporation  7ACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data SheetDevelopment13 ToolsThe logic array consists of logic array blocks (LABs). Each LAB contains \neight LEs and a local interconnect. An LE consists of a 4-input LUT, a programmable flipflop, and dedicated signal paths for carry and cascade \nfunctions. The eight LEs can be used to create medium-sized blocks of \nlogic—such as 8-bit counters, address decoders, or state machines—or combined across LABs to create larger logic blocks. Each LAB represents \nabout 96 usable logic gates.\nSignal interconnections within ACEX 1K devices (as well as to and from \ndevice pins) are provided by the FastTrack Interconnect routing structure, \nwhich is a series of fast, continuous row and column channels that run the \nentire length and width of the device. \nEach I/O pin is fed by an I/O element (IOE) located at the end of each row \nand column of the FastTrack Interconnect routing structure. Each IOE \ncontains a bidirectional I/O buffer and a flipflop that can be used as either an output or input register to feed input, output, or bidirectional signals. \nWhen used with a dedicated clock pin, these registers provide exceptional \nperformance. As inputs, they provide setup times as low as 1.1 ns and \nhold times of 0 ns. As outputs, these registers provide clock-to-output \ntimes as low as 2.5 ns. IOEs provide a variety of features, such as JTAG BST support, slew-rate control, tri-state buffers, and open-drain outputs. \nFigure 1  shows a block diagram of the ACEX 1K device architecture. Each \ngroup of LEs is combined into an LAB; groups of LABs are arranged into \nrows and columns. Each row also contains a single EAB. The LABs and \nEABs are interconnected by the FastTrack Interconnect routing structure. IOEs are located at the end of each row and column of the FastTrack \nInterconnect routing structure.\n8 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 1. ACEX 1K Device Block Diagram\nACEX 1K devices provide six dedicated inputs that drive the flipflops’ \ncontrol inputs and ensure the efficient distribution of high-speed, low-\nskew (less than 1.0 ns) control signals. These signals use dedicated routing \nchannels that provide shorter delays and lower skews than the FastTrack Interconnect routing structure. Four of the dedicated inputs drive four \nglobal signals. These four global signals can also be driven by internal \nlogic, providing an ideal solution for a clock divider or an internally \ngenerated asynchronous clear signal that clears many registers in the \ndevice.

These functions \ncan be combined in applications such as digital filters and \nmicrocontrollers. \nLogic functions are implemented by programming the EAB with a read-\nonly pattern during configuration, thereby creating a large LUT. With \nLUTs, combinatorial functions are implemented by looking up the results \nrather than by computing them. This implementation of combinatorial functions can be faster than using algorithms implemented in general \nlogic, a performance advantage that is further enhanced by the fast access \ntimes of EABs. The large capacity of EABs enables designers to implement complex functions in a single logic level without the routing delays \nassociated with linked LEs or field-programmable gate array (FPGA) \nRAM blocks. For example, a single EAB can implement any function with 8 inputs and 16 outputs. Parameterized functions, such as LPM functions, \ncan take advantage of the EAB automatically.\nThe ACEX 1K enhanced EAB supports dual-port RAM. The dual-port \nstructure is ideal for FIFO buffers with one or two clocks. The ACEX 1K EAB can also support up to 16-bit-wide RAM blocks. The ACEX 1K EAB \ncan act in dual-port or single-port mode. When in dual-port mode, \nseparate clocks may be used for EAB read and write sections, allowing the EAB to be written and read at different rates. It also has separate \nsynchronous clock enable signals for the EAB read and write sections, \nwhich allow independent control of these sections.\nThe EAB can also be used for bidirectional, dual-port memory \napplications where two ports read or write simultaneously. To implement \nthis type of dual-port memory, two EABs are used to support two \nsimultaneous reads or writes.\nAlternatively, one clock and clock enable can be used to control the input \nregisters of the EAB, while a different clock and clock enable control the \noutput registers (see Figure 2 ).\n10 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 2.

A circuit using asynchronous RAM must \ngenerate the RAM write enable signal, while ensuring that its data and address signals meet setup and hold time specifications relative to the \nwrite enable signal. In contrast, the EAB’s synchronous RAM generates its \nown write enable signal and is self-timed with respect to the input or write clock. A circuit using the EAB’s self-timed RAM must only meet the setup \nand hold time specifications of the global clock.\nWhen used as RAM, each EAB can be configured in any of the following \nsizes: 256 ×16; 512×8; 1,024×4; or 2,048 ×2. Figure 5  shows the ACEX 1K \nEAB memory configurations.\nFigure 5. ACEX 1K EAB Memory Configurations\nLarger blocks of RAM are created by combining multiple EABs. For example, two 256 × 16 RAM blocks can be combined to form a 256 ×32 \nblock, and two 512 ×8 RAM blocks can be combined to form a \n512×16 block. Figure 6  shows examples of multiple EAB combination.\nFigure 6.

EABs can be cascaded to form RAM blocks of up to 2,048 words without impacting timing. Altera software automatically combines EABs \nto meet a designer’s RAM specifications.\nEABs provide flexible options for driving and controlling clock signals. \nDifferent clocks and clock enables can be used for reading and writing to \nthe EAB. Registers can be independently inserted on the data input, EAB output, write address, write enable signals, read address, and read enable \nsignals. The global signals and the EAB local interconnect can drive \nwrite-enable, read-enable, and clock-enable signals. The global signals, \ndedicated clock pins, and EAB local interconnect can drive the EAB clock \nsignals. Because the LEs drive the EAB local interconnect, the LEs can control write-enable, read-enable, clear, clock, and clock-enable signals. \nAn EAB is fed by a row interconnect and can drive out to row and column \ninterconnects. Each EAB output can drive up to two row channels and up \nto two column channels; the unused row channel can be driven by other \nLEs. This feature increases the routing resources available for EAB \noutputs (see Figures 2  and 4). The column interconnect, which is adjacent \nto the EAB, has twice as many channels as other columns in the device.\nLogic Array Block\nAn LAB consists of eight LEs, their associated carry and cascade chains, LAB control signals, and the LAB local interconnect. The LAB provides \nthe coarse-grained structure to the ACEX 1K architecture, facilitating \nefficient routing with optimum device utilization and high performance. Figure 7  shows the ACEX 1K LAB.\n14 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 7.

Two of these signals can be used as clocks, the other two can be used for clear/preset control. The LAB clocks can be \ndriven by the dedicated clock input pins, global signals, I/O signals, or \ninternal signals via the LAB local interconnect. The LAB preset and clear control signals can be driven by the global signals, I/O signals, or internal \nsignals via the LAB local interconnect. The global control signals are \ntypically used for global clock, clear, or preset signals because they provide asynchronous control with very low skew across the device. If \nlogic is required on a control signal, it can be generated in one or more LEs \nin any LAB and driven into the local interconnect of the target LAB. In addition, the global control signals can be generated from LE outputs.\nLogic Element\nThe LE, the smallest unit of logic in the ACEX 1K architecture, has a \ncompact size that provides efficient logic utilization. Each LE contains a \n4-input LUT, which is a function generator that can quickly compute any function of four variables. In addition, each LE contains a programmable \nflipflop with a synchronous clock enable, a carry chain, and a cascade \nchain. Each LE drives both the local and the FastTrack Interconnect \nrouting structure. Figure 8  shows the ACEX 1K LE.\n16 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 8. ACEX 1K Logic Element\nThe programmable flipflop in the LE can be configured for D, T, JK, or SR \noperation. The clock, clear, and preset control signals on the flipflop can \nbe driven by global signals, general-purpose I/O pins, or any internal \nlogic. For combinatorial functions, the flipflop is bypassed and the LUT’s output drives the LE’s output. \nThe LE has two outputs that drive the interconnect: one drives the local \ninterconnect, and the other drives either the row or column FastTrack \nInterconnect routing structure. The two outputs can be controlled independently. For example, the LUT can drive one output while the \nregister drives the other output. This feature, called register packing, can \nimprove LE utilization because the register and the LUT can be used for unrelated functions.\nThe ACEX 1K architecture provides two types of dedicated high-speed \ndata paths that connect adjacent LEs without using local interconnect \npaths: carry chains and cascade chains. The carry chain supports high-speed counters and adders, and the cascade chain implements wide-input \nfunctions with minimum delay. Carry and cascade chains connect all LEs \nin a LAB and all LABs in the same row. Intensive use of carry and cascade chains can reduce routing flexibility. Therefore, the use of these chains \nshould be limited to speed-critical portions of a design.To LAB Local\nInterconnectCarry-In\nClock\nSelect\nCarry-OutLook-Up\nTable\n(LUT)\nClear/\nPreset\nLogicCarry\nChainCascade\nChainCascade-In\nCascade-OutTo FastTrack\nInterconnectProgrammable\nRegister\nPRN\nCLRNDQ\nENARegister Bypass\ndata1\ndata2\ndata3\ndata4\nlabctrl1\nlabctrl2\nlabctrl4labctrl3Chip-Wide\nReset\nAltera Corporation  17ACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data SheetDevelopment13 ToolsCarry Chain\nThe carry chain provides a very fast (as low as 0.2 ns) carry-forward \nfunction between LEs. The carry-in signal from a lower-order bit drives \nforward into the higher-order bit via the carry chain, and feeds into both \nthe LUT and the next portion of the carry chain. This feature allows the \nACEX 1K architecture to efficiently implement high-speed counters, adders, and comparators of arbitrary width. Carry chain logic can be \ncreated automatically by the compiler during design processing, or \nmanually by the designer during design entry. Parameterized functions, such as LPM and DesignWare functions, automatically take advantage of \ncarry chains.\nCarry chains longer than eight LEs are automatically implemented by \nlinking LABs together. For enhanced fitting, a long carry chain skips \nalternate LABs in a row. A carry chain longer than one LAB skips either \nfrom even-numbered LAB to even-numbered LAB, or from odd-\nnumbered LAB to odd-numbered LAB. For example, the last LE of the first LAB in a row carries to the first LE of the third LAB in the row. The \ncarry chain does not cross the EAB at the middle of the row. For instance, \nin the EP1K50 device, the carry chain stops at the eighteenth LAB, and a new carry chain begins at the nineteenth LAB.\nFigure 9  shows how an n-bit full adder can be implemented in n+1  L E s  \nwith the carry chain. One portion of the LUT generates the sum of two bits \nusing the input signals and the carry-in signal; the sum is routed to the output of the LE. The register can be bypassed for simple adders or used \nfor an accumulator function. Another portion of the LUT and the carry \nchain logic generates the carry-out signal, which is routed directly to the carry-in signal of the next-higher-order bit. The final carry-out signal is \nrouted to an LE, where it can be used as a general-purpose signal. \n18 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 9.

Adjacent LUTs can be used to \ncompute portions of the function in parallel; the cascade chain serially \nconnects the intermediate values. The cascade chain can use a logical AND \nor logical OR (via De Morgan’s inversion) to connect the outputs of \nadjacent LEs. With a delay as low as 0.6 ns per LE, each additional LE \nprovides four more inputs to the effective width of a function. Cascade \nchain logic can be created automatically by the compiler during design processing, or manually by the designer during design entry.\nCascade chains longer than eight bits are implemented automatically by \nlinking several LABs together. For easier routing, a long cascade chain \nskips every other LAB in a row. A cascade chain longer than one LAB \nskips either from even-numbered LAB to even-numbered LAB, or from \nodd-numbered LAB to odd-numbered LAB (e.g., the last LE of the first \nLAB in a row cascades to the first LE of the third LAB). The cascade chain does not cross the center of the row (e.g., in the EP1K50 device, the cascade \nchain stops at the eighteenth LAB, and a new one begins at the nineteenth \nLAB). This break is due to the EAB’s placement in the middle of the row.\nFigure 10  shows how the cascade function can connect adjacent LEs to \nform functions with a wide fan-in. These examples show functions of 4 n \nvariables implemented with n LEs. The LE delay is 1.3 ns; the cascade \nchain delay is 0.6 ns. With the cascade chain, decoding a 16-bit address requires 3.1 ns.\nFigure 10.

In each mode, seven \navailable inputs to the LE—the four data inputs from the LAB local \ninterconnect, the feedback from the programmable register, and the \ncarry-in and cascade-in from the previous LE—are directed to different destinations to implement the desired logic function. Three inputs to the \nLE provide clock, clear, and preset control for the register. The Altera \nsoftware, in conjunction with parameterized functions such as LPM and DesignWare functions, automatically chooses the appropriate mode for \ncommon functions such as counters, adders, and multipliers. If required, \nthe designer can also create special-purpose functions that use a specific LE operating mode for optimal performance.\nThe architecture provides a synchronous clock enable to the register in all \nfour modes. The Altera software can set DATA1  to enable the register \nsynchronously, providing easy implementation of fully synchronous designs.\nFigure 11  shows the ACEX 1K LE operating modes.\nAltera Corporation  21ACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data SheetDevelopment13 ToolsFigure 11.

In normal \nmode, four data inputs from the LAB local interconnect and the carry-in \nare inputs to a 4-input LUT. The compiler automatically selects the carry-in or the DATA3  signal as one of the inputs to the LUT. The LUT output \ncan be combined with the cascade-in  signal to form a cascade chain \nthrough the cascade-out signal. Either the register or the LUT can be used to drive both the local interconnect and the FastTrack Interconnect routing \nstructure at the same time. \nThe LUT and the register in the LE can be used independently (register \npacking). To support register packing, the LE has two outputs; one drives \nthe local interconnect, and the other drives the FastTrack Interconnect \nrouting structure. The DATA4  signal can drive the register directly, \nallowing the LUT to compute a function that is independent of the registered signal; a 3-input function can be computed in the LUT, and a \nfourth independent signal can be registered. Alternatively, a 4-input \nfunction can be generated, and one of the inputs to this function can be used to drive the register. The register in a packed LE can still use the clock \nenable, clear, and preset signals in the LE. In a packed LE, the register can \ndrive the FastTrack Interconnect routing structure while the LUT drives the local interconnect, or vice versa.\nArithmetic Mode\nThe arithmetic mode offers two 3-input LUTs that are ideal for \nimplementing adders, accumulators, and comparators. One LUT \ncomputes a 3-input function; the other generates a carry output. As shown \nin Figure 11,  the first LUT uses the carry-in signal and two data inputs \nfrom the LAB local interconnect to generate a combinatorial or registered \noutput. For example, in an adder, this output is the sum of three signals: \na, b, and carry-in. The second LUT uses the same three signals to generate \na carry-out signal, thereby creating a carry chain. The arithmetic mode \nalso supports simultaneous use of the cascade chain.\nUp/Down Counter Mode\nThe up/down counter mode offers counter enable, clock enable, \nsynchronous up/down control, and data loading options. These control \nsignals are generated by the data inputs from the LAB local interconnect, \nthe carry-in signal, and output feedback from the programmable register. \nTwo 3-input LUTs are used; one generates the counter data, and the other \ngenerates the fast carry bit. A 2-to-1 multiplexer provides synchronous loading. Data can also be loaded asynchronously with the clear and preset \nregister control signals without using the LUT resources.\nAltera Corporation  23ACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data SheetDevelopment13 ToolsClearable Counter Mode\nThe clearable counter mode is similar to the up/down counter mode, but \nit supports a synchronous clear instead of the up/down control. The clear \nfunction is substituted for the cascade-in signal in the up/down counter \nmode. Two 3-input LUTs are used; one generates the counter data, and the \nother generates the fast carry bit. Synchronous loading is provided by a \n2-to-1 multiplexer. The output of this multiplexer is AND  ed with a \nsynchronous clear signal. \nInternal Tri-State Emulation \nInternal tri-state emulation provides internal tri-states without the \nlimitations of a physical tri-state bus. In a physical tri-state bus, the \ntri-state buffers’ output enable ( OE) signals select which signal drives the \nbus. However, if multiple OE signals are active, contending signals can be \ndriven onto the bus. Conversely, if no OE signals are active, the bus will \nfloat. Internal tri-state emulation resolves contending tri-state buffers to a \nlow value and floating buses to a high value, thereby eliminating these \nproblems. The Altera software automatically implements tri-state bus functionality with a multiplexer. \nClear & Preset Logic Control\nLogic for the programmable register’s clear and preset functions is \ncontrolled by the DATA3 , LABCTRL1 , and LABCTRL2  inputs to the LE. The \nclear and preset control structure of the LE asynchronously loads signals into a register. Either LABCTRL1  or LABCTRL2  can control the \nasynchronous clear. Alternatively, the register can be set up so that \nLABCTRL1  implements an asynchronous load. The data to be loaded is \ndriven to DATA3 ; when LABCTRL1  is asserted, DATA3  is loaded into the \nregister.\nDuring compilation, the compiler automatically selects the best control \nsignal implementation. Because the clear and preset functions are active-low, the Compiler automatically assigns a logic high to an unused clear or \npreset. \nThe clear and preset logic is implemented in one of the following six \nmodes chosen during design entry: \n■ Asynchronous clear\n■ Asynchronous preset\n■ Asynchronous clear and preset\n■ Asynchronous load with clear\n■ Asynchronous load with preset\n■ Asynchronous load without clear or preset\n24 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nIn addition to the six clear and preset modes, ACEX 1K devices provide a \nchip-wide reset pin that can reset all registers in the device. Use of this \nfeature is set during design entry. In any of the clear and preset modes, the chip-wide reset overrides all other signals. Registers with asynchronous \npresets may be preset when the chip-wide reset is asserted. Inversion can \nbe used to implement the asynchronous preset. Figure 12  shows examples \nof how to setup the preset and clear inputs for the desired functionality.\nFigure 12.

In this \nmode, the preset signal is tied to VCC to deactivate it.\nAsynchronous Preset\nAn asynchronous preset is implemented as an asynchronous load, or with \nan asynchronous clear. If DATA3  is tied to VCC, asserting LABCTRL1  \nasynchronously loads a one into the register. Alternatively, the Altera \nsoftware can provide preset control by using the clear and inverting the register’s input and output. Inversion control is available for the inputs to \nboth LEs and IOEs. Therefore, if a register is preset by only one of the two \nLABCTRL  signals, the DATA3  input is not needed and can be used for one \nof the LE operating modes.\nAsynchronous Preset & Clear\nWhen implementing asynchronous clear and preset, LABCTRL1  controls \nthe preset, and LABCTRL2  controls the clear. DATA3  is tied to VCC, so that \nasserting LABCTRL1  asynchronously loads a one into the register, \neffectively presetting the register. Asserting LABCTRL2  clears the register.\nAsynchronous Load with Clear\nWhen implementing an asynchronous load in conjunction with the clear, \nLABCTRL1  implements the asynchronous load of DATA3  by controlling \nthe register preset and clear. LABCTRL2  implements the clear by \ncontrolling the register clear; LABCTRL2  does not have to feed the preset \ncircuits.\nAsynchronous Load with Preset\nWhen implementing an asynchronous load in conjunction with preset, the \nAltera software provides preset control by using the clear and inverting \nthe input and output of the register. Asserting LABCTRL2  presets the \nregister, while asserting LABCTRL1  loads the register. The Altera software \ninverts the signal that drives DATA3  to account for the inversion of the \nregister’s output.\nAsynchronous Load without Preset or Clear\nWhen implementing an asynchronous load without preset or clear, \nLABCTRL1  implements the asynchronous load of DATA3  by controlling \nthe register preset and clear.\n26 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFastTrack Interconnect Routing Structure\nIn the ACEX 1K architecture, connections between LEs, EABs, and device \nI/O pins are provided by the FastTrack Interconnect routing structure, \nwhich is a series of continuous horizontal and vertical routing channels \nthat traverse the device. This global routing structure provides predictable performance, even in complex designs. In contrast, the \nsegmented routing in FPGAs requires switch matrices to connect a \nvariable number of routing paths, increasing the delays between logic resources and reducing performance.\nThe FastTrack Interconnect routing structure consists of row and column \ninterconnect channels that span the entire device. Each row of LABs is \nserved by a dedicated row interconnect. The row interconnect can drive I/O pins and feed other LABs in the row. The column interconnect routes \nsignals between rows and can drive I/O pins.\nRow channels drive into the LAB or EAB local interconnect. The row \nsignal is buffered at every LAB or EAB to reduce the effect of fan-out on delay. A row channel can be driven by an LE or by one of three column \nchannels. These four signals feed dual 4-to-1 multiplexers that connect to \ntwo specific row channels. These multiplexers, which are connected to each LE, allow column channels to drive row channels even when all eight \nLEs in a LAB drive the row interconnect. \nEach column of LABs or EABs is served by a dedicated column \ninterconnect. The column interconnect that serves the EABs has twice as many channels as other column interconnects. The column interconnect \ncan then drive I/O pins or another row’s interconnect to route the signals \nto other LABs or EABs in the device. A signal from the column interconnect, which can be either the output of a LE or an input from an \nI/O pin, must be routed to the row interconnect before it can enter a LAB \nor EAB. Each row channel that is driven by an IOE or EAB can drive one specific column channel.\nAccess to row and column channels can be switched between LEs in \nadjacent pairs of LABs. For example, a LE in one LAB can drive the row \nand column channels normally driven by a particular LE in the adjacent LAB in the same row, and vice versa. This flexibility enables routing \nresources to be used more efficiently. Figure 13  shows the ACEX 1K LAB.\nAltera Corporation  27ACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data SheetDevelopment13 ToolsFigure 13. ACEX 1K LAB Connections to Row & Column Interconnect\nFrom Adjacent LABRow ChannelsColumn\nChannels\nEach LE can drive two\nrow channels.\nLE 2 \nLE 8 LE 1  To Adjacent LAB \nEach LE can switch\ninterconnect access\nwith an LE in the\nadjacent LAB.At each intersection,\nsix row channels can\ndrive column channels.\nTo Other Rows To LAB Local\nInterconnectTo Other\nColumns\n28 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFor improved routing, the row interconnect consists of a combination of \nfull-length and half-length channels. The full-length channels connect to \nall LABs in a row; the half-length channels connect to the LABs in half of the row. The EAB can be driven by the half-length channels in the left half \nof the row and by the full-length channels. The EAB drives out to the full-\nlength channels. In addition to providing a predictable, row-wide interconnect, this architecture provides increased routing resources. Two \nneighboring LABs can be connected using a half-row channel, thereby \nsaving the other half of the channel for the other half of the row.\nTable 6  summarizes the FastTrack Interconnect routing structure \nresources available in each ACEX 1K device.\nIn addition to general-purpose I/O pins, ACEX 1K devices have six \ndedicated input pins that provide low-skew signal distribution across the \ndevice. These six inputs can be used for global clock, clear, preset, and \nperipheral output-enable and clock-enable control signals. These signals are available as control signals for all LABs and IOEs in the device. The \ndedicated inputs can also be used as general-purpose data inputs because \nthey can feed the local interconnect of each LAB in the device. \nFigure 14  shows the interconnection of adjacent LABs and EABs, with \nrow, column, and local interconnects, as well as the associated cascade \nand carry chains. Each LAB is labeled according to its location: a letter \nrepresents the row and a number represents the column. For example, LAB B3 is in row B, column 3.Table 6.

In some cases, using an LE register for an input register will result in a faster setup time than using an IOE register. IOEs can be used \nas input, output, or bidirectional pins. The compiler uses the \nprogrammable inversion option to invert signals from the row and column interconnect automatically where appropriate. For bidirectional \nregistered I/O implementation, the output register should be in the IOE \nand the data input and output enable registers should be LE registers \nplaced adjacent to the bidirectional pin. Figure 15  shows the bidirectional \nI/O registers.I/O Element (IOE)\nRow\nInterconnectIOE\nIOE\nIOE\nIOEColumn\nInterconnect\nLAB\nB1See Figure 17\nfor details.\nSee Figure 16\nfor details.LAB\nA3\nLAB\nB3LAB\nA1LAB\nA2\nLAB\nB2IOE\nIOE\nCascade &\nTo LAB B4To LAB A4\nTo LAB B5To LAB A5\nIOE IOE IOE IOE IOE IOEIOE IOE IOE IOE IOE IOE\nIOE\nIOE\nCarry Chains\n30 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nFigure 15.

Depending on the placement of the IOE \nrelative to what it is driving, the designer may choose to turn on the \nprogrammable delay to ensure a zero hold time or turn it off to minimize setup time. This feature is used to reduce setup time for complex pin-to-\nregister paths (e.g., PCI designs).\nEach IOE selects the clock, clear, clock enable, and output enable controls \nfrom a network of I/O control signals called the peripheral control bus. \nThe peripheral control bus uses high-speed drivers to minimize signal \nskew across devices and provides up to 12 peripheral control signals that \ncan be allocated as follows:\n■ Up to eight output enable signals\n■ Up to six clock enable signals\n■ Up to two clock signals\n■ Up to two clear signals\nIf more than six clock-enable or eight output-enable signals are required, \neach IOE on the device can be controlled by clock enable and output enable signals driven by specific LEs. In addition to the two clock signals \navailable on the peripheral control bus, each IOE can use one of two \ndedicated clock pins. Each peripheral control signal can be driven by any of the dedicated input pins or the first LE of each LAB in a particular row. \nIn addition, a LE in a different row can drive a column interconnect, which \ncauses a row interconnect to drive the peripheral control signal. The chip-wide reset signal resets all IOE registers, overriding any other control \nsignals.\nWhen a dedicated clock pin drives IOE registers, it can be inverted for all \nIOEs in the device. All IOEs must use the same sense of the clock. For example, if any IOE uses the inverted clock, all IOEs must use the inverted \nclock, and no IOE can use the non-inverted clock. However, LEs can still \nuse the true or complement of the clock on an LAB-by-LAB basis. \nThe incoming signal may be inverted at the dedicated clock pin and will \ndrive all IOEs. For the true and complement of a clock to be used to drive \nIOEs, drive it into both global clock pins. One global clock pin will supply \nthe true, and the other will supply the complement. \nWhen the true and complement of a dedicated input drives IOE clocks, \ntwo signals on the peripheral control bus are consumed, one for each \nsense of the clock.\n32 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nWhen dedicated inputs drive non-inverted and inverted peripheral clears, \nclock enables, and output enables, two signals on the peripheral control \nbus will be used.\nTable 7  lists the sources for each peripheral control signal and shows how \nthe output enable, clock enable, clock, and clear signals share 12 peripheral control signals. Table 7  also shows the rows that can drive \nglobal signals.\nSignals on the peripheral control bus can also drive the four global signals, \nreferred to as GLOBAL0  through GLOBAL3 . An internally generated signal \ncan drive a global signal, providing the same low-skew, low-delay characteristics as a signal driven by an input pin. An LE drives the global \nsignal by driving a row line that drives the peripheral bus which then \ndrives the global signal. This feature is ideal for internally generated clear \nor clock signals with high fan-out. However, internally driven global \nsignals offer no advantage over the general-purpose interconnect for routing data signals.\nThe chip-wide output enable pin is an active-high pin that can be used to \ntri-state all pins on the device. This option can be set in the Altera \nsoftware. The built-in I/O pin pull-up resistors (which are active during \nconfiguration) are active when the chip-wide output enable pin is asserted. The registers in the IOE can also be reset by the chip-wide reset \npin.Table 7.

Up to eight IOEs connect to each side of \neach row channel (see Figure 16 ).\nFigure 16.

The SameFrame pin-out feature is the arrangement of balls on FineLine BGA packages such that the lower-ball-\ncount packages form a subset of the higher-ball-count packages. \nSameFrame pin-outs provide the flexibility to migrate not only from device to device within the same package, but also from one package to \nanother. A given printed circuit board (PCB) layout can support multiple \ndevice density/package combinations. For example, a single board layout can support a range of devices from an EP1K10 device in a 256-pin \nFineLine BGA package to an EP1K100 device in a 484-pin FineLine BGA \npackage.\nThe Altera software provides support to design PCBs with SameFrame \npin-out devices. Devices can be defined for present and future use. The \nAltera software generates pin-outs describing how to lay out a board that \ntakes advantage of this migration. Figure 18  shows an example of \nSameFrame pin-out.\nFigure 18.

The \nClockLock circuitry uses a synchronizing PLL that reduces the clock delay \nand skew within a device. This reduction minimizes clock-to-output and \nsetup times while maintaining zero hold times. The ClockBoost circuitry, \nwhich provides a clock multiplier, allows the designer to enhance device area efficiency by sharing resources within the device. The ClockBoost \nfeature allows the designer to distribute a low-speed clock and multiply \nthat clock on-device. Combined, the ClockLock and ClockBoost features provide significant improvements in system performance and \nbandwidth.\nThe ClockLock and ClockBoost features in ACEX 1K devices are enabled \nthrough the Altera software. External devices are not required to use these \nfeatures. The output of the ClockLock and ClockBoost circuits is not \navailable at any of the device pins.\nThe ClockLock and ClockBoost circuitry lock onto the rising edge of the \nincoming clock. The circuit output can drive the clock inputs of registers \nonly; the generated clock cannot be gated or inverted.\nThe dedicated clock pin ( GCLK1 ) supplies the clock to the ClockLock and \nClockBoost circuitry. When the dedicated clock pin is driving the \nClockLock or ClockBoost circuitry, it cannot drive elsewhere in the device.Table 10.

In the Altera \nsoftware, the GCLK1  pin can feed both the ClockLock and ClockBoost \ncircuitry in the ACEX 1K device. However, when both circuits are used, \nthe other clock pin cannot be used.\nClockLock & ClockBoost Timing Parameters\nFor the ClockLock and ClockBoost circuitry to function properly, the incoming clock must meet certain requirements. If these specifications are \nnot met, the circuitry may not lock onto the incoming clock, which \ngenerates an erroneous clock within the device. The clock generated by the ClockLock and ClockBoost circuitry must also meet certain \nspecifications. If the incoming clock meets these requirements during \nconfiguration, the ClockLock and ClockBoost circuitry will lock onto the clock during configuration. The circuit will be ready for use immediately \nafter configuration. Figure 19  shows the incoming and generated clock \nspecifications.\nFigure 19.

The Altera software tunes the PLL in the ClockLock and ClockBoost circuitry to this frequency. The f\nCLKDEV  parameter specifies how much the incoming clock can differ from the specified frequency during device \noperation. Simulation does not reflect this parameter.\n(2) Twenty-five thousand parts per million (PPM) equates to 2.5 % of input clock period.\n(3) During device configuration, the ClockLock and ClockBoost circuitry is configured before the rest of the device. If \nthe incoming clock is supplied during configuration, the ClockLock and ClockBoost circuitry locks during configuration because the t\nLOCK  value is less than the time required for configuration.\n(4) The tJITTER  specification is measured under long-term observation. The maximum value for tJITTER  is 200 ps if \ntINCLKSTB  is lower than 50 ps.\nI/O \nConfigurationThis section discusses the PCI pull-up clamping diode option, slew-rate \ncontrol, open-drain output option, and MultiVolt I/O interface for \nACEX 1K devices. The PCI pull-up clamping diode, slew-rate control, and open-drain output options are controlled pin-by-pin via Altera software \nlogic options. The MultiVolt I/O interface is controlled by connecting \nV\nCCIO  to a different voltage than VCCINT . Its effect can be simulated in the \nAltera software via the Global Project Device Options  dialog box (Assign \nmenu).Table 12.

PCI clamping diodes clamp the signal to \nthe V CCIO  value and are required for 3.3-V PCI compliance. Clamping \ndiodes can also be used to limit overshoot in other systems.\nClamping diodes are controlled on a pin-by-pin basis. When VCCIO  is \n3.3 V, a pin that has the clamping diode option turned on can be driven by \na 2.5-V or 3.3-V signal, but not a 5.0-V signal. When V CCIO  is 2.5 V, a pin \nthat has the clamping diode option turned on can be driven by a 2.5-V signal, but not a 3.3-V or 5.0-V signal. Additionally, a clamping diode can \nbe activated for a subset of pins, which allows a device to bridge between \na 3.3-V PCI bus and a 5.0-V device.\nSlew-Rate Control\nThe output buffer in each IOE has an adjustable output slew rate that can be configured for low-noise or high-speed performance. A slower slew \nrate reduces system noise and adds a maximum delay of 4.3 ns. The fast \nslew rate should be used for speed-critical outputs in systems that are adequately protected against noise. Designers can specify the slew rate \npin-by-pin or assign a default slew rate to all pins on a device-wide basis. \nThe slow slew rate setting affects only the falling edge of the output.\nOpen-Drain Output Option\nACEX 1K devices provide an optional open-drain output (electrically \nequivalent to open-collector output) for each I/O pin. This open-drain \noutput enables the device to provide system-level control signals (e.g., interrupt and write enable signals) that can be asserted by any of several \ndevices. It can also provide an additional wired- OR plane. \nMultiVolt I/O Interface \nThe ACEX 1K device architecture supports the MultiVolt I/O interface \nfeature, which allows ACEX 1K devices in all packages to interface with systems of differing supply voltages. These devices have one set of V\nCC \npins for internal operation and input buffers ( VCCINT ), and another set for \nI/O output drivers ( VCCIO ). \nAltera Corporation  41ACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data SheetDevelopment13 ToolsThe VCCINT  pins must always be connected to a 2.5-V power supply. \nWith a 2.5-V VCCINT  level, input voltages are compatible with 2.5-V, 3.3-\nV, and 5.0-V inputs. The VCCIO  pins can be connected to either a 2.5-V or \n3.3-V power supply, depending on the output requirements. When the \nVCCIO  pins are connected to a 2.5-V power supply, the output levels are \ncompatible with 2.5-V systems. When the VCCIO  pins are connected to a \n3.3-V power supply, the output high is at 3.3 V and is therefore compatible \nwith 3.3-V or 5.0-V systems. Devices operating with VCCIO  levels higher \nthan 3.0 V achieve a faster timing delay of tOD2 instead of tOD1.\nTable 13 summarizes ACEX 1K MultiVolt I/O support.\nNotes:\n(1) The PCI clamping diode must be disabled on an input which is driven with a \nvoltage higher than VCCIO .\n(2) When VCCIO  = 3.3 V, an ACEX 1K device can drive a 2.5-V device that has 3.3-V \ntolerant inputs.\nOpen-drain output pins on ACEX 1K devices (with a pull-up resistor to \nthe 5.0-V supply) can drive 5.0-V CMOS input pins that require a higher \nVIH than LVTTL. When the open-drain pin is active, it will drive low. \nWhen the pin is inactive, the resistor will pull up the trace to 5.0 V, thereby \nmeeting the CMOS VOH requirement. The open-drain pin will only drive \nlow or tri-state; it will never drive high. The rise time is dependent on the \nvalue of the pull-up resistor and load impedance. The I OL current \nspecification should be considered when selecting a pull-up resistor.\nPower \nSequencing & \nHot-SocketingBecause ACEX 1K devices can be used in a mixed-voltage environment, \nthey have been designed specifically to tolerate any possible power-up \nsequence. The V CCIO  and VCCINT  power planes can be powered in any \norder.\nSignals can be driven into ACEX 1K devices before and during power up \nwithout damaging the device. Additionally, ACEX 1K devices do not drive out during power up. Once operating conditions are reached, \nACEX 1K devices operate as specified by the user.Table 13.

Output Drive Characteristics of ACEX 1K Devices\nTiming ModelThe continuous, high-performance FastTrack Interconnect routing \nresources ensure accurate simulation and timing analysis as well as \npredictable performance. This predictable performance contrasts with \nthat of FPGAs, which use a segmented connection scheme and, therefore, \nhave an unpredictable performance. \nDevice performance can be estimated by following the signal path from a \nsource, through the interconnect, to the destination. For example, the registered performance between two LEs on the same row can be \ncalculated by adding the following parameters: \n■ LE register clock-to-output delay ( tCO)\n■ Interconnect delay ( tSAMEROW )\n■ LE look-up table delay ( tLUT)\n■ LE register setup time ( tSU)\nThe routing delay depends on the placement of the source and destination \nLEs. A more complex registered path may involve multiple combinatorial LEs between the source and destination LEs. \nTiming simulation and delay prediction are available with the simulator \nand Timing Analyzer, or with industry-standard EDA tools. The \nSimulator offers both pre-synthesis functional simulation to evaluate logic \ndesign accuracy and post-synthesis timing simulation with 0.1-ns \nresolution.

These parameters cannot be \nmeasured explicitly.\n(2) Operating conditions: VCCIO  = 3.3 V ± 10 % for commercial or industrial and extended use in ACEX 1K devices\n(3) Operating conditions: VCCIO  = 2.5 V ± 5 % for commercial or industrial and extended use in ACEX 1K devices.\n(4) Operating conditions: V CCIO  = 2.5 V or 3.3 V.\n(5) Because the RAM in the EAB is self-timed, this parameter can be ignored when the WE signal is registered. \n(6) EAB macroparameters are internal parameters that can simplify predicting the behavior of an EAB at its boundary; \nthese parameters are calculated by summing selected microparameters. \n(7) These parameters are worst-case values for typical applications. Post-compilation timing simulation and timing \nanalysis are required to determine actual worst-case performance.Table 26.

This value is calculated based on the amount of current \nthat each LE typically consumes. The PIO value, which depends on the \ndevice output load characteristics and switching frequency, can be \ncalculated using the guidelines given in Application Note 74 (Evaluating \nPower for Altera Devices) .\n1 Compared to the rest of the device, the embedded array \nconsumes a negligible amount of power. Therefore, the \nembedded array can be ignored when calculating supply \ncurrent.Table 57.

The actual ICC should be verified during \noperation because this measurement is sensitive to the actual pattern in \nthe device and the environmental operating conditions.\nTo better reflect actual designs, the power model (and the constant K in \nthe power calculation equations) for continuous interconnect ACEX 1K \ndevices assumes that LEs drive FastTrack Interconnect channels. In \ncontrast, the power model of segmented FPGAs assumes that all LEs drive only one short interconnect segment. This assumption may lead to \ninaccurate results when compared to measured power consumption for \nactual designs in segmented FPGAs.\nFigure 31  shows the relationship between the current and operating \nfrequency of ACEX 1K devices.

ACEX 1K ICCACTIVE  vs. Operating Frequency\nConfiguration & \nOperationThe ACEX 1K architecture supports several configuration schemes. This \nsection summarizes the device operating modes and available device \nconfiguration schemes. \nOperating Modes\nThe ACEX 1K architecture uses SRAM configuration elements that \nrequire configuration data to be loaded every time the circuit powers up. The process of physically loading the SRAM data into the device is called \nconfiguration . Before configuration, as V\nCC rises, the device initiates a \nPower-On Reset (POR). This POR event clears the device and prepares it for configuration. The ACEX 1K POR time does not exceed 50 µs.\n1 When configuring with a configuration device, refer to the \nrelevant configuration device data sheet for POR timing \ninformation.0\nFrequency (MHz)300\n200\n100\n50 100EP1K100\nICC Supply \nCurrent (mA)0\nFrequency (MHz)ICC Supply \nCurrent (mA)100\n80\n6040\n20\n50 100EP1K30\n0\nFrequency (MHz)ICC Supply \nCurrent (mA)200\n150\n100\n50\n50 100EP1K50\n84 Altera CorporationACEX 1K Programmable Logic Device Family Data Sheet\nDuring initialization, which occurs immediately after configuration, the \ndevice resets registers, enables I/O pins, and begins to operate as a logic \ndevice. Before and during configuration, all I/O pins (except dedicated inputs, clock, or configuration pins) are pulled high by a weak pull-up \nresistor. Together, the configuration and initialization processes are called \ncommand mode ; normal device operation is called user mode .\nSRAM configuration elements allow ACEX 1K devices to be reconfigured \nin-circuit by loading new configuration data into the device. Real-time \nreconfiguration is performed by forcing the device into command mode \nwith a device pin, loading different configuration data, re-initializing the device, and resuming user-mode operation. The entire reconfiguration \nprocess requires less than 40 ms and can be used to reconfigure an entire \nsystem dynamically. In-field upgrades can be performed by distributing new configuration files.\nConfiguration Schemes\nThe configuration data for an ACEX 1K device can be loaded with one of \nfive configuration schemes (see Table 59 ), chosen on the basis of the target \napplication. An EPC16, EPC2, EPC1, or EPC1441 configuration device, intelligent controller, or the JTAG port can be used to control the \nconfiguration of a ACEX 1K device, allowing automatic configuration on \nsystem power-up.\nMultiple ACEX 1K devices can be configured in any of the five \nconfiguration schemes by connecting the configuration enable ( nCE) and \nconfiguration enable output ( nCEO ) pins on each device. Additional \nAPEX 20K, APEX 20KE, FLEX 10K, FLEX 10KA, FLEX 10KE, ACEX 1K, and FLEX 6000 devices can be configured in the same serial chain.\nDevice Pin-\nOutsSee the Altera web site ( http://www.altera.com ) or the Altera Documen-\ntation Library  for pin-out information.Table 59.
