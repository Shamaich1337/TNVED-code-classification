#### Description:
The 28WFT-1000 is a flexible twistable waveguide designed for high-frequency applications, specifically within the frequency range of 26.5 to 40.0 GHz. It is constructed from copper and features a rubber jacket for protection. The waveguide is engineered to allow for significant twisting and bending, making it suitable for installations where space is limited or where directional changes are necessary.

#### Typical Applications:
The 28WFT-1000 waveguide is typically used in:
- **Telecommunications:** For signal transmission in microwave communication systems.
- **Radar Systems:** As part of radar equipment where flexibility in installation is required.
- **Aerospace and Defense:** In applications that require high-frequency signal transmission with minimal loss.
- **Test Equipment:** For connecting various components in high-frequency test setups.

This component is particularly valuable in environments where traditional rigid waveguides would be impractical due to space constraints or the need for dynamic movement.
