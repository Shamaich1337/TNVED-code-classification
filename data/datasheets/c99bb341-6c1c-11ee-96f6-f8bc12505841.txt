WPEN pro tects \nwriting to a status register (see “ \uf06e WRITING PROTECT”) relating with WP  \ninput. Writing with the WRSR c ommand and reading with the RDSR com-\nmand are possible. \n6 to 4 \uf0beNot Used Bits\nThese are bits composed of nonvo latile memories, writing with t he WRSR \ncommand is possible, and “000” is  written before shipment. Thes e bits are \nnot used but they are read  with the RDSR command. \n3 BP1Block Protect\nThis is a bit composed of nonvola tile memory. This defines size  of write \nprotect block for the WRITE command (see “ \uf06e BLOCK PROTECT”). \nWriting with the WRSR command and reading with the RDSR command  \nare possible. 2 BP0\n1W E LWrite Enable Latch\nThis indicates FRAM Array and sta tus register are writable. The  WREN \ncommand is for setting, and the WRDI command is for resetting. With the \nRDSR command, reading is possible but writing is not possible w ith the \nWRSR command. WEL is reset after the following operations. \nAfter power ON.After WRDI command recognition.\n0 0 This is a bit fixed to “0”. \nName Description Op-code\nWREN Set Write Enable Latch 0000 0110\nB\nWRDI Reset Write Enable Latch 0000 0100 B\nRDSR Read Status R egister 0000 0101 B\nWRSR Write Status Register 0000 0001 B\nREAD Read Memory Code 0000 0011 B\nWRITE Write Memory Code 0000 0010 B\nRDID Read Device ID 1001 1111 B\nSLEEP Sleep Mode 1011 1001 B\nRFU Reserved for future use*10000 1011 B\nMB85RS64T\nDS501-00051-2v0-E 7\uf06eCOMMAND\n\uf0b7 WREN\nThe WREN command sets WEL (Write Enable Latch) .

After op-code of R DSR is input to SI, 8-cycle clock is input\nto SCK. The SI value is invalid d uring this time. SO is output synchronously to a falling edge of SCK. In the\nRDSR command, repeated reading of status register is enabled by  sending SCK continuously before rising\nof CS . \n\uf0b7 WRSR\nThe WRSR command writes data to the nonvolatile memory bit of s tatus register. After performing WRSR\nop-code to a SI pin, 8 bits writing data is input. WEL (Write E nable Latch) is not able to be written with WRSR\ncommand. A SI value correspondent to bit 1 is ignored. Bit 0 of  the status register is fixed to “0” and cannot\nbe written. The SI value corresponding to bit 0 is ignored.

Arbitrary 1 6 bits address and op-code of READ\nare input to SI. The 3-bit upper address bit is invalid. Then, 8-cycle clock is input to SCK. SO is output\nsynchronously to the falling edge of SCK. While reading, the SI  value is invalid. When CS  is risen, the READ\ncommand is completed, but keeps on reading with automatic addre ss increment which is enabled by con-\ntinuously sending clocks to SCK  in unit of 8 cycles before CS  rising. When it reaches the most significant\naddress, it rolls ove r to the starting add ress, and reading cyc le keeps on infinitely.\n\uf0b7 WRITE\nThe WRITE command writes data to FRAM memory cell array. WRITE op-code, arbitrary 16 bits of address\nand 8 bits of writing data are input to SI. The 3-bit upper add ress bit is invalid. When 8 bits of writing data is\ninput, data is written to FRAM memory cell array. Risen CS  will terminate the WRIT E command. However,\nif you continue sending the writing data for 8 bits each before  CS rising, it is possible to continue writing with\nautomatic address increment. When it reaches the most significa nt address, it rolls over to the starting\naddress, and writing cycle ke eps on continued infinitely.

After performing RDID o p-code to SI, 32-cycle clock is input\nto SCK. The SI value is invalid for this time. SO is output syn chronously to a falling edge of SCK. The output\nis in order of Manufacturer ID (8bit)/Continuation code (8bit)/ Product ID (1st Byte)/Product ID (2nd Byte). \nIn the RDID command, SO holds the  output state of the last bit in 32-bit Device ID until CS  is risen. \n\uf0b7 SLEEP\n The SLEEP command shifts the LSI to a low power mode called “S LEEP mode”. The transition to the SLEEP\nmode is carried out at the rising edge of CS  after operation code in the SLEEP command. However, when\nat least one SCK clock is inputted before the rising edge of CS  after operation code in the SLEEP command,\nthis SLEEP command is canceled.\n      After the SLEEP mode transit ion, SCK and SI inputs are ig nored and SO changes to a Hi-Z state.SOSCK\nSICS\nMSB76543210\nData Out Data Out\nHigh-Z\nLSB111098 333231 39 3837363534\nInvalid\n30 2829 3110011111\n201 3 645 78\nbit\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0H e x\nManufacturer ID 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 04 HFujitsu\nContinuation code 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7F H\nProprietary use Density Hex\nProduct ID (1st Byte) 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 23 HDensity:00011 B \uf03d 64Kbit\nProprietary use Hex\nProduct ID (2nd Byte) 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 03 H\nEnter Sleep Mode\nCS\nSCKSIInvalid Invalid\nHi-Z\nSleep Mode Entry67 012345\nSO1 1011100\nMB85RS64T\nDS501-00051-2v0-E 11Returning to an normal operation from the SLEEP mode is carried  out after t REC (Max 400 \uf06ds) time from the\nfalling edge of CS  (see the figure below).

The\ntiming for starting and ending hold status depends on the SCK t o be the “H” level or the “L” level when a\nHOLD  pin input is transited to the hold condition as shown in the d iagram below. In case the HOLD  pin\ntransited to “L” level when SCK is “L” level, return the HOLD  pin to “H” level at SCK being “L” level. In the\nsame manner, in case the HOLD  pin transited to “L” level when SCK is “H” level, return the H OLD pin to “H”\nlevel at SCK being “H” level. Arbitrary command operation is in terrupted in hold status, SCK and SI inputs\nbecome don’t care. And, SO becomes High-Z while reading command  (RDSR, READ). If CS  is rising during\nhold status, a command is aborted. In case the command is abort ed before its recognition, WEL holds the\nvalue before transition to hold status.
