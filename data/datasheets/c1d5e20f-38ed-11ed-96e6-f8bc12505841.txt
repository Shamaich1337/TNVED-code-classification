With integrated buck power MOSFET, theLM5008 delivers upto350-mA DCload\ncurrent with exceptional efficiency andlowinput quiescent current inavery small solution size.\nDesigned forsimple implementation, anearly fixed-frequency, constant on-time (COT) operation with\ndiscontinuous conduction mode (DCM) atlight loads isideal forlow-noise, high current, fast transient load\nrequirements.

This willcontinue until regulation isachieved.\nThe LM5008 operates indiscontinuous conduction mode atlight load currents, andcontinuous conduction mode\natheavy load current. Indiscontinuous conduction mode, current through theoutput inductor starts atzero and\nramps uptoapeak during theon-time, then ramps back tozero before theendoftheoff-time. The next on-time\nperiod starts when thevoltage atFBfalls below theinternal reference; until then, theinductor current remains\nzero. Inthismode theoperating frequency islower than incontinuous conduction mode, and varies with load\ncurrent. Therefore atlight loads theconversion efficiency ismaintained, because theswitching losses reduce\nwith thereduction inload and frequency. The discontinuous operating frequency can becalculated with\nEquation 1.\nwhere\n•RL=theload resistance (1)\nIncontinuous conduction mode, current flows continuously through theinductor andnever ramps down tozero.\nInthismode theoperating frequency isgreater than thediscontinuous mode frequency and remains relatively\nconstant with load andlinevariations. The approximate continuous mode operating frequency canbecalculated\nwith Equation 2.\n(2)\nThe output voltage (VOUT)canbeprogrammed bytwoexternal resistors asshown inFunctional Block Diagram .\nTheregulation point canbecalculated with Equation 3.\nVOUT=2.5×(R1+R2)/R2 (3)\nAllhysteretic regulators regulate theoutput voltage based onripple voltage atthefeedback input, requiring a\nminimum amount ofESR fortheoutput capacitor C2.Aminimum of25mVto50mVofripple voltage atthe\nfeedback pin(FB) isrequired fortheLM5008. Incases where thecapacitor ESR istoosmall, additional series\nresistance may berequired (R3inFunctional Block Diagram ).\nForapplications where lower output voltage ripple isrequired theoutput canbetaken directly from alow-ESR\noutput capacitor, asshown inFigure 7.However, R3slightly degrades theload regulation.\nFigure 7.Low-Ripple Output Configuration\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFBSWL1\nC2VOUT2R3LM5008BSTVCC\nC4\nD2\nD1R1\nR2C3\n9LM5008\nwww.ti.com SNVS280I –APRIL 2004 –REVISED OCTOBER 2018\nProduct Folder Links: LM5008Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2018, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFeature Description (continued)\n7.3.2 High Voltage Start-Up Regulator\nThe LM5008 contains aninternal high voltage start-up regulator. The input pin(VIN)canbeconnected directly to\nthelinevoltages upto95Volts, with transient capability to100V.Theregulator isinternally current limited to9.5\nmAatVCC.Upon power up,theregulator sources current into theexternal capacitor atVCC(C3). When the\nvoltage ontheVCCpinreaches theundervoltage lockout threshold of6.3V,thebuck switch isenabled.\nInapplications involving ahigh value forVIN,where power dissipation intheVCCregulator isaconcern, an\nauxiliary voltage canbediode connected totheVCCpin.Setting theauxiliary voltage to8Vto14Vshuts offthe\ninternal regulator, reducing internal power dissipation. See Figure 8.The current required into theVCCpinis\nshown inFigure 1.\nFigure 8.Self-Biased Configuration\n7.3.3 Regulation Comparator\nThefeedback voltage atFBiscompared toaninternal 2.5-V reference. Innormal operation (theoutput voltage is\nregulated), anon-time period isinitiated when thevoltage atFBfalls below 2.5V.The buck switch stays onfor\ntheon-time, causing theFBvoltage toriseabove 2.5V.After theon-time period, thebuck switch stays offuntil\ntheFBvoltage again falls below 2.5V.During start-up, theFBvoltage isbelow 2.5Vattheendofeach on-time,\nresulting intheminimum off-time of300ns.Bias current attheFBpinisnominally 100nA.\n7.3.4 Overvoltage Comparator\nThe feedback voltage atFBiscompared toaninternal 2.875-V reference. Ifthevoltage atFBrises above 2.875\nV,theon-time pulse isimmediately terminated. This condition canoccur iftheinput voltage, ortheoutput load,\nchange suddenly. Thebuck switch willnotturnonagain until thevoltage atFBfalls below 2.5V.\n7.3.5 On-Time Generator andShutdown\nThe on-time fortheLM5008 isdetermined bytheRONresistor, andisinversely proportional totheinput voltage\n(VIN),resulting inanearly constant frequency asVINisvaried over itsrange. Equation 4shows theon-time\nequation fortheLM5008.\nTON=1.25 ×10–10×RON/VIN (4)\nSee Figure 2.RONshould beselected foraminimum on-time (atmaximum VIN)greater than 400 nsforproper\ncurrent limit operation.

See Figure 9.The voltage atthe\nRON/SDpinisbetween 1.5and3volts, depending onVINandthevalue oftheRONresistor.\nFigure 9.Shutdown Implementation\n7.3.6 Current Limit\nThe LM5008 contains anintelligent current limit off-timer. Ifthecurrent inthebuck switch exceeds 0.5Athe\npresent cycle isimmediately terminated, and anon-resetable off-timer isinitiated. The length ofoff-time is\ncontrolled byanexternal resistor (RCL)andtheFBvoltage (see Figure 4).When FB=0V,amaximum off-time is\nrequired, andthetime ispreset to35µs.This condition occurs when theoutput isshorted, andduring theinitial\npart ofstart-up. This amount oftime ensures safe short-circuit operation uptothemaximum input voltage of95\nV.Incases ofoverload where theFBvoltage isabove zero volts (notashort circuit), thecurrent limit off-time will\nbeless than 35µs.Reducing theoff-time during less severe overloads reduces theamount offoldback, recovery\ntime, andthestart-up time. Theoff-time iscalculated from Equation 5.\n(5)\nThe current limit sensing circuit isblanked forthefirst50-70 nsofeach on-time soitisnotfalsely tripped bythe\ncurrent surge which occurs atturnon. The current surge isrequired bythere-circulating diode (D1) foritsturnoff\nrecovery.\n7.3.7 N-Channel Buck Switch andDriver\nThe LM5008 integrates anN-Channel Buck switch and associated floating high voltage gate driver. The gate\ndriver circuit works inconjunction with anexternal bootstrap capacitor andaninternal high voltage diode. A0.01-\nµFceramic capacitor (C4) connected between theBST pinandSWpinprovides thevoltage tothedriver during\ntheon-time.\nDuring each off-time, theSWpinisatapproximately 0V,andthebootstrap capacitor charges from VCCthrough\ntheinternal diode.

An\ninternal thermal shutdown circuit isprovided toprotect theLM5008 intheevent ofahigher than normal junction\ntemperature. When activated, typically at165°C,thecontroller isforced intoalowpower reset state, disabling\nthebuck switch and theVCCregulator. This feature prevents catastrophic failures from accidental device\noverheating. When thejunction temperature reduces below 140°C(typical hysteresis =25°C),theVCCregulator\nisenabled, andnormal operation isresumed.\n\x0b \x0cOUTL\nBOUNDARY\nF SWV 1 DII2 2 L F\x98 \x10 \'  \x98 \x98 \n11LM5008\nwww.ti.com SNVS280I –APRIL 2004 –REVISED OCTOBER 2018\nProduct Folder Links: LM5008Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2018, Texas Instruments Incorporated7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Shutdown Mode\nThe RON/SD pinprovides ONand OFF control fortheLM5008. When VSDisbelow approximately 0.7V,the\ndevice isinshutdown mode. Both theinternal LDO andtheswitching regulator areoff.The quiescent current in\nshutdown mode drops to76µA(typical) atVIN=48V.The LM5008 also employs VCC bias railundervoltage\nprotection. IftheVCCbias supply voltage isbelow itsUVthreshold, theregulator remains off.\n7.4.2 Active Mode\nLM5008 isinactive mode when theinternal bias rail,VCC, isabove itsUVthreshold. Depending ontheload\ncurrent, thedevice operates ineither DCM orCCM mode.\nWhenever theload current isreduced toalevel less than halfthepeak-to-peak inductor ripple current, thedevice\nenters discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). Calculate thecritical conduction boundary using Equation 6.\n(6)\nWhen theinductor current reaches zero, theSWnode becomes high impedance. Resonant ringing occurs atSW\nasaresult oftheLCtank circuit formed bythebuck inductor andtheparasitic capacitance attheSWnode. At\nlight loads, several pulses may beskipped inbetween switching cycles, effectively reducing theswitching\nfrequency andfurther improving light-load efficiency.\nFBVIN\nSW\nRTNBST\nLM50088\n6\n53\n4127\nSHUTDOWNVCC\nRCLRON/ SD12 - 95V\nInput\n357kC1\n1.0 F µ\nRON\nRCL\n267kR2\n1.0kR1\n3.01kR3\n2.0\nGNDC2\n15 F µVOUT2VOUT110.0VL1\n220 H µC3\n0.1 F µ\nC4\n0.01 F µ\nD1C5\n0.1 F µ\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n12LM5008\nSNVS280I –APRIL 2004 –REVISED OCTOBER 2018 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM5008Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2018, Texas Instruments Incorporated8Application andImplementation\nNOTE\nInformation inthe following applications sections isnot part ofthe TIcomponent\nspecification, and TIdoes notwarrant itsaccuracy orcompleteness.

Other values could\nbeused aslong asthe3:1ratio ismaintained. The selected values, however, provide asmall amount ofoutput\nloading (2.5mA) intheevent themain load isdisconnected. This allows thecircuit tomaintain regulation until the\nmain load isreconnected.\nFsand RON:The recommended operating frequency range fortheLM5008 is50kHz to600 kHz. Unless the\napplication requires aspecific frequency, thechoice offrequency isgenerally acompromise because itaffects\nthesize ofL1andC2,andtheswitching losses. The maximum allowed frequency, based onaminimum on-time\nof400ns,iscalculated from Equation 7:\nFMAX=VOUT/(VINMAX ×400ns) (7)\nForthisexercise, FMAX=263kHz. From Equation 2,RONcalculates to304kΩ.Astandard value 357-kΩresistor\nisused toallow fortolerances inEquation 2,resulting inafrequency of224kHz.\nL1:The main parameter affected bytheinductor istheoutput current ripple amplitude. The choice ofinductor\nvalue therefore depends onboth theminimum and maximum load currents, keeping inmind that themaximum\nripple current occurs atmaximum VIN.\na.Minimum load current: Tomaintain continuous conduction atminimum Io(100 mA), theripple amplitude\n391 mA\n300 mA\n209 mA \n0 mA\n1/Freq.\n= TsTs/2\nL1 Current\nL1 =VOUT1 x (VIN - VOUT1)\n IOR x Fs x VIN\n14LM5008\nSNVS280I –APRIL 2004 –REVISED OCTOBER 2018 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM5008Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2018, Texas Instruments Incorporated(IOR)must beless than 200mAp-p sothelower peak ofthewaveform does notreach zero. L1iscalculated\nusing Equation 8.\n(8)\nAtVIN=95V,L1(minimum) calculates to200 µH.The next larger standard value (220 µH)ischosen and\nwith thisvalue IORcalculates to181mAp-p atVIN=95V,and34mAp-p atVIN=12V.\nb.Maximum load current: Ataload current of300 mA, thepeak oftheripple waveform must notreach the\nminimum value oftheLM5008 ’scurrent limit threshold (410 mA). Therefore theripple amplitude must beless\nthan 220 mAp-p, which isalready satisfied inEquation 8.With L1=220 µH,atmaximum VINand IO,the\npeak oftheripple willbe391mA. While L1must carry thispeak current without saturating orexceeding its\ntemperature rating, italso must becapable ofcarrying themaximum value oftheLM5008 ’scurrent limit\nthreshold (610 mA) without saturating, because thecurrent limit isreached during start-up.\nThe DCresistance oftheinductor should beaslowaspossible. Forexample, iftheinductor ’sDCR is1Ω,\nthepower dissipated atmaximum load current is0.09 W.While small, itisnotinsignificant compared tothe\nload power of3W.\nC3:The capacitor ontheVCCoutput provides notonly noise filtering and stability, butitsprimary purpose isto\nprevent false triggering oftheVCCUVLO atthebuck switch ON/OFF transitions. Forthisreason, C3should be\nnosmaller than 0.1µF.\nC2,and R3: When selecting theoutput filter capacitor C2,theitems toconsider areripple voltage due toits\nESR, ripple voltage duetoitscapacitance, andthenature oftheload.\na.ESR andR3:AlowESR forC2isgenerally desirable soastominimize power losses andheating within the\ncapacitor. However, ahysteretic regulator requires aminimum amount ofripple voltage atthefeedback input\nforproper loop operation. FortheLM5008 theminimum ripple required atpin5is25mVp-p, requiring a\nminimum ripple atVOUT1 of100mV. Because theminimum ripple current (atminimum VIN)is34mAp-p, the\nminimum ESR required atVOUT1 is100 mV /34mA =2.94Ω.Because quality capacitors forSMPS\napplications have anESR considerably less than this, R3isinserted asshown inFunctional Block Diagram .\nR3’svalue, along with C2’sESR, must result inatleast 25mVp-p ripple atpin5.Generally, R3willbe0.5to\n3Ω.\nb.Nature oftheLoad: The load canbeconnected toVOUT1 orVOUT2.VOUT1 provides good regulation, butwith\naripple voltage which ranges from 100 mV(atVIN=12V)to500 mV(atVIN=95V).Alternatively, VOUT2\nprovides lowripple, butlower regulation duetoR3.\nForamaximum allowed ripple voltage of100mVp-p atVOUT2 (atVIN=95V),assume anESR of0.4Ωfor\nC2.Atmaximum VIN,theripple current is181mAp-p, creating aripple voltage of72mVp-p. This leaves 28\nmVp-p ofripple due tothecapacitance. The average current intoC2due totheripple current iscalculated\nusing thewaveform inFigure 11.\nFigure 11.Inductor Current Waveform\nStarting when thecurrent reaches Io(300 mAinFigure 11)half way through theon-time, thecurrent\ncontinues toincrease tothepeak (391 mA), and then decreases to300 mAhalfway through theoff-time.\nThe average value ofthisportion ofthewaveform is45.5 mA, andwillcause halfofthevoltage ripple, or14\nmV.

However, thiscalculation provides apractical minimum value forC2based onitsESR andthetarget\nspec. Toallow forthecapacitor ’stolerance, temperature effects, andvoltage effects, a15-µF,X7R capacitor\nisused.\nc.Insummary: The above calculations provide aminimum value forC2andacalculation forR3.The ESR is\njustasimportant asthecapacitance.

Foreach application, experimentation isneeded todetermine theoptimum values forR3andC2.\nC=I×Δt/ΔV (9)\nRCL:When acurrent limit condition isdetected, theminimum off-time setbythisresistor must begreater than the\nmaximum normal off-time which occurs atmaximum VIN.Using Equation 4,theminimum on-time is0.47 µs,\nyielding amaximum off-time of3.99 µs.This isincreased by117ns(to4.11 µs)duetoa±25% tolerance ofthe\non-time. This value isthen increased toallow for:\nTheresponse time ofthecurrent limit detection loop (400 ns).\nTheoff-time determined byEquation 5hasa±25% tolerance.\ntOFFCL(MIN) =(4.11 µs+0.40 µs)×1.25 =5.64 µs (10)\nUsing Equation 5,RCLcalculates to264kΩ(atVFB=2.5V).Theclosest standard value is267kΩ.\nD1: The important parameters arereverse recovery time and forward voltage. The reverse recovery time\ndetermines how long thereverse current surge lasts each time thebuck switch isturned on.The forward voltage\ndrop issignificant intheevent theoutput isshort-circuited asitisonly thisdiode ’svoltage which forces the\ninductor current toreduce during theforced off-time. Forthisreason, ahigher voltage isbetter, although that\naffects efficiency. Agood choice isanultra-fast power diode, such astheMURA110T3 from ONSemiconductor.\nItsreverse recovery time is30ns,anditsforward voltage drop isapproximately 0.72 Vat300mAat25°C.Other\ntypes ofdiodes may have alower forward voltage drop, butmay have longer recovery times, orgreater reverse\nleakage. D1’sreverse voltage rating must beatleast asgreat asthemaximum VIN,and itscurrent rating be\ngreater than themaximum current limit threshold (610 mA).\nC1: This capacitor ’spurpose istosupply most oftheswitch current during theon-time, and limit thevoltage\nripple atVIN,ontheassumption thatthevoltage source feeding VINhasanoutput impedance greater than zero.\nAtmaximum load current when thebuck switch turns on,thecurrent intopin8willsuddenly increase tothelower\npeak oftheoutput current waveform, ramp uptothepeak value, then drop tozero atturnoff. The average input\ncurrent during this on-time istheload current (300 mA). Foraworst case calculation, C1must supply this\naverage load current during themaximum on-time. Tokeep theinput voltage ripple toless than 2V(forthis\nexercise), C1iscalculated with Equation 11.\n(11)\nQuality ceramic capacitors inthisvalue have alowESR which adds only afewmillivolts totheripple. Itisthe\ncapacitance which isdominant inthis case. Toallow forthecapacitor ’stolerance, temperature effects, and\nvoltage effects, a1.0-µF,100-V, X7R capacitor willbeused.\nC4: The recommended value is0.01 µFforC4,asthisisappropriate inthemajority ofapplications. Ahigh-\nquality ceramic capacitor, with lowESR isrecommended asC4supplies thesurge current tocharge thebuck\nswitch gate atturnon. AlowESR also ensures aquick recharge during each off-time. Atminimum VIN,when the\non-time isatmaximum, itispossible during start-up that C4willnotfully recharge during each 300-ns off-time.\nThe circuit willnotbeable tocomplete thestart-up, and achieve output regulation. This can occur when the\nfrequency isintended tobelow(forexample, RON=500 K).Inthiscase C4should beincreased soitcan\nmaintain sufficient voltage across thebuck switch driver during each on-time.\nC5:This capacitor helps avoid supply voltage transients and ringing due tolong lead inductance atVIN.Alow-\nESR, 0.1-µFceramic chip capacitor isrecommended, placed close totheLM5008.\nK \x98\x98 \nINOUTOUT\nINVIVI\nLOAD CURRENT (mA)\nEFFICIENCY (%)\n405060708090100\n100 200 300VIN = 48V VIN = 15V\nVIN = 95V\n0 20 40 60 80 100405060708090100EFFICIENCY (%)\nVIN (V)IOUT = 300 mA\n16LM5008\nSNVS280I –APRIL 2004 –REVISED OCTOBER 2018 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: LM5008Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2004 –2018, Texas Instruments Incorporated8.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 12.Efficiency vsVIN Figure 13.Efficiency vsLoad Current vsVIN\n9Power Supply Recommendations\nThe LM5008 converter isdesigned tooperate from awide input voltage range from 9.5Vto95V.The\ncharacteristics oftheinput supply must becompatible with theAbsolute Maximum Ratings andRecommended\nOperating Conditions .Inaddition, theinput supply must becapable ofdelivering therequired input current tothe\nfully-loaded regulator.

The parasitic inductance andresistance oftheinput cables\nmay have anadverse affect onconverter operation. The parasitic inductance incombination with thelow-ESR\nceramic input capacitors form anunderdamped resonant circuit. This circuit cancause overvoltage transients at\nVINeach time theinput supply iscycled ONand OFF. The parasitic resistance causes theinput voltage todip\nduring aload transient.
