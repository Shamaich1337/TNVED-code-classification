It is an ideal \nchoice for driving low power, high performance ADCs as a \nsingle- ended -to-differential or differential -to-differential \namplifier. It provides a precisi on gain of 1, common -mode level \nshifting, low temperature drift, and rail -to-rail outputs for \nmaximum dynamic range .   \nThe AD8476 also provides overvoltage protection from large  \nindustrial input voltages up to  ±23 V while operating on a dual 5 V \nsupply. Powe r dissipation on a single 5  V supply is only 1.5  m W.   \nThe AD8476 works well with SAR, Σ-Δ, and pipeline converters.  \nThe high current output stage of the part allows it t o drive the switched capacitor front -end circuits of many ADCs with  \nminimal error . \nUnlike many differential drivers o n the market, the AD8476 is  \na high precision amplifier. With 200 µV maximum  output \noffset,  39 nV/√Hz noise, and −1 02 dB THD  + N at 10 kHz , the \nAD8476 pairs well with low power, high accuracy converters.  \nConsidering its lo w power consumption and high precision, the \nslew- enhanced AD8476 has excellent speed, settling to 1 6-bit \nprecision for 250 k SPS acquisition times . \nThe AD8476 is availab le in space -saving 16 -lead, 3 mm × 3 mm \nLFCSP and 8 -lead MSOP packages. It is fully specified over the \n−40°C to +125°C temperature range. \n \nAD8476 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

At \napproximately 15 0°C, which is the glass transition temperature, \nthe properties of the plastic change . Even temporarily exceed ing \nthis temperature limit may change the stresses that the package \nexerts on the die, permanently shifting the parametric perfor mance  \nof the amplifiers. Exceeding a temperature of 15 0°C for an \nextended period may  result in a loss of fun ctionality.  \nESD CAUTION  \n \n \n \n \nAD8476 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Sign al and Circuit Definitions  \nDifferential Voltage  \nDifferential voltage refers to the difference between two  \nnode voltages. For example, the output differential voltage (or equivalently, output differential mode voltage) is defined as  \nV\nOUT, dm  = (V+OUT − V−OUT) \nwhere  V+OUT and V−OUT refer to the voltages at the +OUT and \n−OUT terminals with respect to a common ground reference.

B | Page 17 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nOVERVIEW  \nThe AD8476 is a fully differential amplifier, with integrated  laser-\ntrimmed resistors, that provides a precision gain of 1. The \ninternal differential amplifier of the AD8476 differs from \nconventional operational amplifiers in that it has two outputs \nwhose voltages are equal in magnitude, but move in opposite \ndirections (180° out of phase).  \nThe AD8476 is designed to greatly simplify single -ended -to-\ndifferenti al conversion, common -mode level shifting and \nprecision driving of differential signals into low power , \ndifferential input ADCs. The VOCM input allows the user to  \nset the output common -mode voltage to match with the input \nrange of the ADC.  Like an  operati onal amplifier, the VOCM \nfunction  relies on high open -loop gain and negative feedback to \nforce the output nodes to the desired voltages.  \n10kΩ\n10kΩ10kΩ\n10kΩINN 1\n+VS2\nVOCM 3\n+OUT 4INP 8\n–VS 7\nNC6\n–OUT5\nNOTES\n1.NC = NO CONNEC T.\nDO NOT CONNECT TO THIS PIN.\n10195-058AD8476\n \nFigure 51. Block Diagram  \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION  \nThe AD8476 amplifier uses a voltage feedback topology; \ntherefore, the amplifier exhibits a nominally constant gain bandwidth product. Like a voltage feedback operational amplifier, the AD8476 also has high input im pedance at its \ninternal input terminals (the summing nodes of the internal amplifier) and low output impedance.  \nThe AD8476 employs two feedback loops, one each to control \nthe differential and common -mode output v oltages. The  differen -\ntial feedback loop, which is fixed with precision laser -trimmed \non-chip resistors, controls the differential output voltage.  \nOutput Common -Mode Voltage (VOCM)  \nThe internal common -mode feedback controls the common -\nmode output voltage.  This architecture makes it easy for the \nuser to set the output common -mode level to any arbitrary \nvalue independent of the input voltage. The output common -\nmode voltage is forced by the internal common -mode feedback \nloop to be equal to the voltage applied to the VOCM input. The \nVOCM pin can be left unconnected, and the output common-mode voltage self -biases to midsupply by the internal feedback \ncontrol.  Due to the internal common -mode feedback loop and the fully \ndifferential topology  of the amplifier, the AD8476 outputs are \nprecisely balanced over a wide frequency range. This means that the amplifier’s differential outputs are very close to the ideal of being identical in amplitude and exactly 180° out of phase.  \nDC PRECISION  \nThe dc precision of the AD8476  is highly dependent on the \naccuracy of its integrated gain  resistors. Using superposition to \nanalyze the circuit shown in Figure 52, the follow ing equation \nshows the relationship between the input and output voltages of \nthe amplifier:  \n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )N P dm OUT N P cm OUTN P N P dmIN N P cm IN\nR R V R R VR R R R V R R V\n+ + + − =+ + + −\n221221\n, ,, ,\n \nwhere:  \nRGPRFPRP= , RGNRFNRN=  \nN P dmIN V V V− =,  \n) (21\n, N P cm IN V V V + =  \nThe differential closed- loop gain of  the amplifier is  \nN PN P N P\ndmINdm OUT\nR RR R R R\nVV\n+ ++ +=22\n,, \nand the common rejection of the amplifier is  \n( )\nN PN P\ncm INdm OUT\nR RR R\nVV\n+ +−=22\n,, \nRFP\nRFNRGP\nRGNVON\nVOPVOCMVP\nVN\n10195-059 \nFigure 52. Functional Circuit Diagram of the AD8476  at a Given Gain  \nThe pr eceding equations show that the gain accuracy and the \ncommon -mode rejection (CMRR) of the AD8476 are deter -\nmined primarily by the matching of the feedback networks \n(resistor ratios).

T o achieve equivalent precision  \nand performance using a discrete solution, resistors must be \nmatched to 0.01% or better. \nINPUT VOLTAGE RANGE  \nThe AD8476 can measure input v oltages  as large as the supply \nrails. The internal gain and feedback resistors form a divider, which reduces the input voltage seen by the internal input nodes  of the amplifier. The largest voltage that can be measured \nproperly is constrained by the outpu t range of the amplifier and \nthe capability of the amplifier’s internal summing nodes. This voltage is defined by the input voltage , and the ratio between the \nfeedback and the gain resistors. \nFigure 53 shows the voltage at the i nternal summing nodes of \nthe amplifier, defined by the input voltage and internal resistor network. If V\nN is grounded, the expression shown reduces to  \n\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb++= =P MINUS PLUS VRGRFVOCMRG RFRGV V21 \nThe internal amplifier of the AD8476 has rail -to-rail inputs.  \nTo obtain accurate measurements with minimal distortion, the voltage at the internal inputs of the amplifier must stay below \n+V\nS − 1 V and above −V S. \nThe AD8476 provides overvoltage protection for excessive input \nvoltages beyond the supply rails. Integrated ESD protection  diodes \nat the inputs prevent damage to the AD8476 up to +V S + 18 V \nand −V S − 18 V. DRIVING THE AD8476  \nCare should be taken to drive the AD8476 with a low \nimpedance source: for example, another amplifier. Source resistance can unbalanc e the resistor ratios and, therefore, \nsignificantly degrade the gain accuracy and common -mode \nrejection of the AD8476. For the best performance, source \nimpedance to the AD8476 input terminals should be kept  \nbelow 0.1 Ω. Refer  to the DC Precision  section for details on  \nthe critical role of resistor ratios in the precision of the AD8476. \nPOWER SUPPLIES  \nThe AD8476 operates over a wide range of supply voltages. It \ncan be powered on a single supply as low as 3 V and as high as \n18 V . The AD8476 can also operate on dual supplies from \n±1.5 V to ±9 V \nA stable dc voltag e should be used to power the AD8476. Note \nthat noise on the supply pins can adversely affect performance. For more information, see the PSRR performance curve in Figure 10.  \nPlace a byp ass capacitor of 0.1 μF between each supply pin and \nground, as close as possible to each supply pin. Use a tantalum \ncapacitor of 10 μF between each supply and ground. It can be \nfarther away from the supply pins and, typically, it can be shared by other pre cision integrated circuits.  \n \n \nRF\nRFRG\nRGVON\nVOPVOCMVP\nVNVNRF + RGRFVP − V NRGRFVOCM\nRF + RGRG+ +\n21\n10195-060 \nFigure 53.

B | Page 19 of 24 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nTYPICAL CONFIGURATIO N \nThe AD8476 is designed to facilitate single -ended -to-differential  \nconversion, common -mode level shifting, and precision processing  \nof signals so that they are compatible with low voltage ADCs.  \nFigure 54 shows a typical con nection diagram of the AD8476. \nSINGLE -ENDED -TO-DIFFERENTIAL CONVERS ION  \nMany industrial systems have single -ended  inputs from input \nsensors ; however, the signals are frequently processed by high \nperformance differ ential input ADCs for higher precision. The \nAD8476 performs the critical function of precisely converting \nsingle- ended signals to the differential inputs of precision \nADCs, and it does so with no need for externa l components.  \nTo convert a single -ended signal to a differential signal, connect \none input to the signal source and the other input to ground (see  \nFigure 54). Note  that either input can be driven by the source \nwith the only effec t being that the outputs have reversed polarity. \nThe AD8476 also accepts truly differential input signals in \nprecision systems with differential signal paths.  \nSETTING THE OUTPUT C OMMON- MODE VOLTAGE  \nThe VOCM pin o f the AD8476 is internally biased by  a \nprecision voltage divider comprising of two 1 MΩ resistors \nbetween the supplies. This divider level shifts the output to \nmidsupply. Relying on the internal bias results in a n output \ncommon -mode voltage that is within 0.05% of the expected \nvalue.  \n10195-10210kΩ\n10kΩ10kΩ\n10kΩINN\n1\n+VS\n2\nVOCM 3\n+OUT\n4INP\n8\n–VS\n7\nNC6\n–OUT\n5\nAD8476 LOADINPUT\nSIGNA L\nSOURCE\n+5V–VOUT\n+VOUT\n+ 10µF 0.1µF\n+10µF 0.1µF–5V\n \nFigure 54. Typical Configuration —8- Lead MSOP  In cases where control of the output common -mode level is \ndesired, an external source or resistor divider can be used to \ndrive the VOCM pin . If driven directly from a source, or with a \nresistor div ider of unequal resistor values , the  resistance seen by \nthe VOCM pin should be less than 1  kΩ. If an external voltage \ndivider consisting of equal resistor values is used to set VOCM to midsupply, higher values can be used because the external \nresistors are placed in parallel with the internal resistors. The \noutput common -mode offset listed in the  Specifications  section \nassumes that the VOCM  input is driven by a low impedance  \nvoltage source.   \nBecause of the internal divider, the VOCM  pin sources and sinks \ncurrent, depending  on the externally applied voltage and its \nassocia ted source resistance.  \nIt is also possible to connect the VOCM  input to the common -\nmode level  output of an ADC; however, care must be taken to \nensure that the output has sufficient drive capability. The input impedance of the VOCM  pin is 500 kΩ. If multipl e AD8476 \ndevices share one ADC reference output, a buffer may be neces -\nsary to drive the parallel inputs.  \nTable 6.

B | Page 20 of 24 LOW POWER ADC DRIVING \nThe AD8476 is designed to be a low power driver for ADCs  \nwith up to 16-bit precision and sampling rates of up to  \n250 kSPS. The circuit in Figure 56 shows the AD8476 driving \nthe AD7687, a 16-bit, 250 kSPS fully differential SAR ADC.  \nThe filter between the AD8476 and the ADC reduces high frequency noise and reduces switching transients from the \nsampling of the ADC.  \nChoose the values of this filter with care. Optimal values for the \nfilter may need to be determined empirically, but the guidelines discussed herein are provided to help the user. For optimum performance, this filter should be fast enough to settle full-scale to 0.5 LSB of the ADC within the acquisition time specified in \nthe ADC data sheet, in this case, the AD7687. If the filter is \nslower than the acquisition time, distortion can result that looks \nlike harmonics. If the filter is too fast, the noise bandwidth of the amplifier increases, thereby reducing the SNR of your \nsystem.  \nAdditional considerations help determine the values of the \nindividual components. THD of the ADC is likely to increase \nwith source resistance. This is stated in the ADC data sheet.  \nTo reduce this effect, try to use smaller resistance and larger capacitance. Large capacitance values much greater than 2 nF are hard for the amplifier to drive. Higher capacitance also \nincreases the effect of changes in output impedance.  \nIt is also important to consider the signal frequency range of \ninterest. The AD8476 THD decreases with higher frequency \n(see Figure 42) and output impedance increases with higher frequency (see Figure 49). This higher output impedance yields slower settling, thus be certain to choose your capacitance so that the filter still meets the settling requirement at the \nmaximum frequency of interest.  \nIn the application shown, a 100 Ω resistors and 2.2 nF \ncapacitors at each output were chosen. For driving the AD7687, \nthis combination yields an SNR loss of 2.5 dB and good THD performance for a 20 kHz fundamental frequency, with an ADC throughput rate of 250kSPS. The filter bandwidth can be \ndetermined by the following equation: \nRCFrequency Filter\uf07021\uf03d  \n0\n–10\n–20\n–30–40\n–50\n–60–70–80\n–90\n–100\n–110–120\n–130\n–140\n–180–170–160–150\n0 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 4 0ADC FULL SCALE (dB)\nFREQUENCY (kHz)\n10195-064VIN = 8V p-p\nTHD = –112dB\nSNR = 93dB\n \nFigure 55.
