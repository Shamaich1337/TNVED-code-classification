LFCSP ADP151 with Fixed Output Voltage, 1.8 V \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADP151 is an ultralow noise, low dropout (LDO) linear \nregulator that operates from 2.2 V to 5.5 V and provides up to \n200 mA of output current. The low 135 mV dropout voltage at \n200 mA load improves efficiency  and allows operation over a \nwide input voltage range. \nUsing an innovative circuit topology, the ADP151 achieves \nultralow noise performance without the necessity of a bypass \ncapacitor, making the device ideal for noise sensitive analog and RF applications. The ADP151 also achieves ultralow noise \nperformance without compromising the power supply rejection \nratio (PSRR) or transient line and load performance. The low 265 μA of operating supply curre nt at 200 mA load makes the \nADP151 suitable for battery-ope rated portable equipment. The ADP151 also includes an internal pull-down resistor on \nthe EN input. \nThe ADP151 is specifically design ed for stable operation with \ntiny 1 μF, ±30% ceramic input and output capacitors to meet \nthe requirements of high performance, space constrained applications. \nThe ADP151 is capable of 16 fixed output voltage options, \nranging from 1.1 V to 3.3 V. \nShort-circuit and thermal overload  protection circuits prevent \ndamage in adverse conditions. Th e ADP151 is available in tiny \n5-lead TSOT, 6-lead LFCSP, and 4-ball, 0.4 mm pitch, halide-\nfree WLCSP packages for the smallest footprint solution to \nmeet a variety of portable po wer application requirements. \n \nADP151 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

This is a \nstress rating only; functional operation of the product at these \nor any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is  not implied. Operation beyond \nthe maximum operating conditions for extended periods may affect product reliability. \nTHERMAL DATA \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in combination. The ADP151 can be  damaged when the junction \ntemperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature \ndoes not guarantee that T\nJ is within the specified temperature \nlimits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature may have to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low \nprinted circuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum \nambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as \nthe junction temperature is within specification limits. T\nJ of the \ndevice is dependent on T A, the power dissipation of the device \n(PD), and the junction to ambient thermal resistance of the \npackage (θ JA).  \nTo calculate the maximum T J from T A and P D use the following \nequation:  \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \nThe θ JA of the package is based on modeling and calculation \nusing a 4-layer board. θ JA is highly dependent on the application \nand board layout. In applications where high maximum P D \nexists, close attention to therma l board design is required. The \nvalue of θ JA may vary, depending on PCB material, layout, and \nenvironmental conditions. Th e specified values of θ JA are based \non a 4-layer, 4 inches × 3 inch es circuit board. See JESD51-7 \nand JESD51-9 for detailed information on the board \nconstruction. For additional information, see the AN-617 \nApplication Note , MicroCSP™  Wafer Level Chip Scale Package . ΨJB is the junction to board, thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W. Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling \nand calculation using a 4-layer board. The JESD51-12, \nGuidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal \nInformation, states that thermal characterization parameters are not the same as thermal resistances. Ψ\nJB measures the component \npower flowing through multiple thermal paths rather than a \nsingle path as in θ JB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths include \nconvection from the top of the package as well as radiation \nfrom the package, factors that make Ψ JB more useful in real-\nworld applications. To calculate the maximum T J from the \nboard temperature (T B) and P D, use the following equation:  \nTJ = TB + (PD × ΨJB) \nSee JESD51-8 and JESD51-12 for more detailed information about Ψ\nJB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE \nθJA and Ψ JB are specified for the worst- case conditions, that is, a \ndevice soldered in a circuit board for surface-mount packages. \nTable 4.

I | Page 11 of 23 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADP151 is an ultralow noise, low quiescent current, LDO \nlinear regulator that operates from 2.2 V to 5.5 V and can provide up to 200 mA of output current. Drawing a low 265 μA of operating supply current (typical) at full load makes the \nADP151 ideal for battery oper ated, portable equipment. \nShutdown current consumption is typically 0.2 μA. \nUsing a proprietary architecture , the ADP151 provides superior \nnoise performance for noise sensitive analog and RF applications \nwithout the need for a noise by pass capacitor. The ADP151 is \nalso optimized for use with sm all 1 μF ceramic capacitors.  \n08627-025REFERENCESHORT-CIRCUIT,\nUVLO, AND\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\nSHUTDOWNR1\nR2\nRENVOUT VIN\nGND\nEN\n \nFigure 27. Internal Block Diagram Internally, the ADP151 consists of a reference, an error \namplifier, a feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. Output current is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error \namplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device pulls lower, allowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltag e. If the feedback voltage is \nhigher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device pulls higher, allowing less current to pass and decreasing the output voltage. \nAn internal pull-down resistor on the EN input holds the input \nlow when the pin is left open. \nThe ADP151 is available in 16 ou tput voltage options, ranging \nfrom 1.1 V to 3.3 V. The ADP151 uses the EN pin to enable and \ndisable the VOUT pin under normal operating conditions. When EN is high, VOUT turns on, and when EN is low, VOUT turns \noff. For automatic startup, tie EN to VIN. \n \nADP151 Data Sheet\n \nRev. I | Page 12 of 23 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADP151 is designed for operat ion with small, space-saving \nceramic capacitors but can func tion with most commonly used \ncapacitors as long as care is ta ken with regard to the effective \nseries resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor \naffects the stability of the LD O control loop. A minimum of \n1 μF capacitance with an ESR of 1 Ω or less is recommended \nto ensure the stability of the ADP151. Transient response to \nchanges in load current is also affected by output capacitance. \nUsing a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP 151 to large changes in load \ncurrent. Figure 28 shows the tran sient responses for an output \ncapacitance value of 1 μF. \nCH1  200mA CH2  50mV M20µs A  CH1       64mA\nT   10.00%1\n2T\nLOAD CURRENT\nVOUT\n08627-026 \nFigure 28. Output Transient Response, C OUT = 1 μF \nInput Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 1 μF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the \ncircuit sensitivity to the PCB layout, especially when long input traces or high source impedanc e are encountered. If greater \nthan 1 μF of output capacitance is required, the input capacitor \nmust be increased to match it. \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitor can be used with the \nADP151 as long as the capacitor meets the minimum \ncapacitance and maximum ESR requirements. Ceramic \ncapacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have an adequate dielectric to ensure \nthe minimum capacitance over  the necessary temperature \nrange and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V or 10 V are recommended. Y5V and \nZ5U dielectrics are not reco mmended due to their poor \ntemperature and dc bias characteristics.  Figure 29 depicts the capacitance vs. voltage bias characteristic of an 0402, 1 μF, 10 V X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or \nhigher voltage rating exhibits better stability. The temperature \nvariation of the X5R dielectric is ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and is not a function of package or \nvoltage rating. \n1.2\n1.00.8\n0.6\n0.40.2\n0\n02468 1 0CAPACITANCE (µF)\nVOLTAGE BIAS\n08627-027 \nFigure 29.

Typical Start-Up Behavior \nADJUSTABLE OUTPUT VOLTAGE OPERATION \nThe unique architecture of th e ADP151 makes an adjustable \nversion difficult to implement in silicon. However, it is possible \nto create an adjustable regulator at the expense of increasing the \nquiescent current of the regulator circuit. \nThe ADP151, and similar LDOs, are designed to regulate the \noutput voltage (V OUT) appearing at the VOUT pin with respect \nto the GND pin. If the GND pin is at a potential other than 0 V \n(for example, at the offset voltage (V OFFSET )), the ADP151 \noutput voltage is V OUT + V OFFSET . By taking advantage of this \nbehavior, it is possible to crea te an adjustable ADP151 circuit \nthat retains most of the desirable characteristics of the ADP151. \n08627-131U11\n2\n35\n4C2C1VOUT VINVOUT\nNCVIN\nGND\nEN\nC3 R2VOFFSET\nR1\nVOUT = VLDO × (1 + R2/R1) \nFigure 33. Adjustable LDO Using the ADP151 \nThe circuit shown in Figure 33 is an example of an adjustable \nLDO using the ADP151. A stable V OFFSET  voltage is created by \npassing a known current through R2. The current through R2 is determined by the voltage across R1. Because the voltage across R1 is set by the voltage betw een VOUT and GND, the current \npassing through R2 is fixed, and V\nOFFSET  is stable. \nTo minimize the effect variation of the ADP151 ground current (I\nGND) with load, it is best to keep R1 as small as possible. It is \nalso best to size the current passing through R2 to at least 20× \ngreater than the maximum expected ground current. \nADP151 Data Sheet\n \nRev. I | Page 14 of 23 To create a 4 V LDO circuit, star t with the 3.3 V version of the \nADP151 to minimize the value of R2. Because V OUT is 4 V, V OFFSET  \nmust be 0.7 V, and the current through R2 must be 7 mA. R1 is, \ntherefore, 3.3 V/7 mA or 471 Ω. A 470 Ω standard value introduces \nless than 1% error. Capacitor C3 is necessary to stabilize the LDO. \nA value of 1 μF is adequate. \nFigure 34 through Figure 38 show the typical performance of \nthe 4 V LDO circuit. \nThe noise performance of the 4 V LDO circuit is only about \n1 μV worse than the same LDO used at 3.3 V because the \noutput noise of the circuit is almost solely determined by the LDO and not the external comp onents. The small difference \nmay be attributed to the internally generated noise in the LDO \nground current working with R2. By keeping R2 small, this \nnoise contribution can be minimized. \nThe PSRR of the 4 V circuit is as much as 10 dB poorer than the \n3.3 V LDO with 500 mV of he adroom because the ground \ncurrent of the LDO varies slightly with input voltage. This, in turn, modulates V\nOFFSET  and reduces the PSRR of the regulator. \nBy increasing the headroom to 1 V, the PSRR performance is \nnearly restored to the performance of the fixed output LDO. \n4.04\n4.03\n4.02\n4.014.003.993.983.973.96\n– 4 0 – 52 58 5 1 2 5VOUT (V)\nJUNCTION TEMPERATURE (°C)\n08627-132LOAD = 10mA\nLOAD = 20mA\nLOAD = 50mA\nLOAD = 100mA\nLOAD = 150mA\nLOAD = 200mA\n \nFigure 34. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical Load Regulation over Temperature \nVOUT (V)\nVIN (V)\n08627-133LOAD = 10mA\nLOAD = 20mA\nLOAD = 50mA\nLOAD = 100mA\nLOAD = 150mA\nLOAD = 200mA4.040\n4.035\n4.0304.0254.0204.0154.010\n4.005\n4.000\n4.4 5.2 5.4 4.8 4.6 5.0\n \nFigure 35. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical Line Regulation over Load Current 11\n10\n9\n8\n1 100 1k 10NOISE (µV rms)\nLOAD CURRENT (mA)\n08627-134 \nFigure 36. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical RMS Output Noise, 10 Hz to 100 kHz \n0\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40\n–50\n–60\n–70\n–80\n–90\n–100\n10 100 1k 10k 100k 1M 10M\nFREQUENCY (Hz)PSRR (dB)\n08627-049200mA\n100mA\n50mA10mA\n \nFigure 37. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical PSRR vs. Load Current, 1 V Headroom \n0\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40\n–50\n–60\n–70\n–80\n–90\n–100\n10 100 1k 10k 100k 1M 10M\nFREQUENCY (Hz)PSRR (dB)\n08627-050200mA\n100mA\n50mA10mA\n \nFigure 38. 4 V LDO Circuit, Typical PSRR vs. Load Current, 500 mV Headroom \nData Sheet ADP151\n \nRev. I | Page 15 of 23 CURRENT-LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADP151 is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by current and thermal overload protection circuits. The ADP151 is designed  to current limit when the \noutput load reaches 300 mA (typ ical). When the output load \nexceeds 300 mA, the output voltage is reduced to maintain a constant current limit. \nThermal overload protection is in cluded, which limits the junction \ntemperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme \nconditions (that is, high am bient temperature and power \ndissipation) when the junction temperature starts to rise above \n150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output current \nto 0. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again, and the output current is restored to its nominal value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground \noccurs. At first, the ADP151 current limits, so that only 300 mA is conducted into the short. If se lf heating of the junction causes \nits temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal shutdown activates, turning off the output and reducing the output current to 0. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 300 mA into  the short, again causing the \njunction temperature to rise abov e 150°C. This thermal oscillation \nbetween 135°C and 150°C causes a current oscillation between \n300 mA and 0 mA that continues as long as the short remains \nat the output. \nCurrent-limit and thermal limit protections protect the device \nagainst accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, device power dissipation must be  externally limited so that \njunction temperatures do not exceed 125°C. \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS \nIn most applications, the ADP151 does not dissipate much heat due to its high efficiency. However, in applications with a high \nambient temperature and a high supply voltage to output voltage \ndifferential, the heat dissipated in the package can cause the junction temperature of the die to exceed the maximum junction temperature of 125°C.  \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. The conv erter recovers only after the \njunction temperature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any \npermanent damage. Therefore, th ermal analysis for the chosen \napplication is important to guar antee reliable performance over \nall conditions. The junction temper ature of the die is the sum of \nthe ambient temperature of the environment and the temperature \nrise of the package due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 2. To guarantee reliable operation,  the junction temperature of \nthe ADP151 must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction temperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be aware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature \nchanges. These parameters incl ude ambient temperature, power \ndissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between \nthe junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent \non the package assembly compounds that are used and the amount of copper used to solder the package GND pins to the PCB. \nTable 6 shows typical θ\nJA values of the 5-lead TSOT, the 6-lead \nLFCSP, and the 4-ball WLCSP for various PCB copper sizes. \nTable 7 shows the typical Ψ JB values of the 5-lead TSOT, the  \n6-lead LFCSP, and the 4-ball WLCSP. \nTable 6.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to the following: \nT\nJ = TA + ((( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD) × θJA) (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given ambient temperature, \ninput to output voltage differe ntial, and continuous load \ncurrent, there exists a minimu m copper size requirement for \nthe PCB to ensure that the junction temperature does not rise \nabove 125°C.  \nADP151 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
