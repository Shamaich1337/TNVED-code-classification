The ports can be configured to any  \ncombination of logic inputs and logic outputs, and  \ndefault to logic inputs on power-up.\nFigure 1 is the MAX7301 functional diagram. Any I/O \nport can be configured as a push-pull output (sinking  \n10mA, sourcing 4.5mA), or a Schmitt-trigger logic  \ninput. Each input has an individually selectable internal \npullup resistor. Additionally, transition detection allows \nseven ports (P24 through P30) to be monitored in any \nmaskable combination for changes in their logic status. \nA detected transition is flagged through an interrupt pin \n(port P31).\nThe port configuration registers set the 28 ports, P4 \nto P31, individually as GPIO. A pair of bits in registers  \n0x09 through 0x0F sets each port’s configuration  \n(Tables 1 and 2).\nThe 36-pin MAX7301AAX and 40-pin MAX7301ATL  \nhave 28 ports, P4 to P31. The 28-pin MAX7301AAI is \noffered in 20 ports, P12 to P31. The eight unused ports \nshould be configured as outputs on power-up by writ-\ning 0x55 to registers 0x09 and 0x0A. If this is not done, \nthe eight unused ports remain as floating inputs and  \nquiescent supply current rises, although there is no dam -\nage to the part.Register Control of I/O Ports  \nAcross Multiple Drivers\nThe MAX7301 offers 20 or 28 I/O ports, depending on \npackage choice. \nTwo addressing methods are available. Any single \nport (bit) can be written (set/cleared) at once; or, any  \nsequence of eight ports can be written (set/cleared) in \nany combination at once. There are no boundaries; it is \nequally acceptable to write P0 through P7, P1 through P8, \nor P31 through P38 (P32 through P38 are nonexistent,  \nso the instructions to these bits are ignored).\nShutdown\nWhen the MAX7301 is in shutdown mode, \nall ports are forced to inputs, and the pullup cur -\nrent sources are turned off. Data in the port and  \ncontrol registers remain unaltered so port configuration \nand output levels are restored when the MAX7301 is \ntaken out of shutdown. The display driver can still be  \nprogrammed while in shutdown mode. For minimum  \nsupply current in shutdown mode, logic inputs should  \nbe at GND or V+ potential. Shutdown mode is exited by \nsetting the S bit  in the configuration register (Table 6). PIN\nNAME FUNCTION\n36 SSOP 28 SSOP TQFN\n1 1 36 ISETBias Current Setting.

The interface has three  \ninputs, Clock (SCLK), Chip Select ( CS), and Data In \n(DIN), and one output, Data Out (DOUT). CS must be  \nlow to clock data into or out of the device, and DIN  \nmust be stable when sampled on the rising edge of  \nSCLK. DOUT provides a copy of the bit that was input \n15.5 clocks earlier, or upon a query it outputs internal \nregister data, and is stable on the rising edge of SCLK. \nNote that the SPI protocol expects DOUT to be high \nimpedance when the MAX7301 is not being accessed; \nDOUT on the MAX7301 is never high impedance.  \nRefer to Application Note 1879: Using Maxim SPI-\ncompatible Display Drivers with other SPI Peripherals  \nfor ways to convert DOUT to tri-state, if required.\nSCLK and DIN may be used to transmit data to other  \nperipherals, so the MAX7301 ignores all activity on  \nSCLK and DIN except between the fall and subsequent  \nrise of CS.\nControl and Operation Using the  \n4-Wire Interface\nControlling the MAX7301 requires sending a 16-bit  \nword. The first byte, D15 through D8, is the command address (Table 3), and the second byte, D7 through D0, \nis the data byte (Table 4 through Table 8).\nConnecting Multiple MAX7301s  \nto the 4-Wire Bus\nMultiple MAX7301s may be daisy-chained by connect -\ning the DOUT of one device to the DIN of the next, and \ndriving SCLK and CS lines in parallel (Figure 3). Data at \nDIN propagates through the internal shift registers and \nappears at DOUT 15.5 clock cycles later, clocked out on \nthe falling edge of SCLK. When sending commands to \nmultiple MAX7301s, all devices are accessed at the same \ntime. An access requires (16 × n) clock cycles, where n is \nthe number of MAX7301s connected together. To update \njust one device in a daisy-chain, the user can send the \nNo-Op command (0x00) to the others.\nWriting Device Registers \nThe MAX7301 contains a 16-bit shift register into which \nDIN data are clocked on the rising edge of SCLK, when \nCS is low. When CS is high, transitions on SCLK have \nno effect. When CS goes high, the 16 bits in the Shift \nregister are parallel loaded into a 16-bit latch. The \n16 bits in the latch are then decoded and executed.  Table 2. Port Configuration MatrixTable 1.

This enables the internal 16-bit shift \nregister. \n3) Clock 16 bits of data into DIN—D15 first, D0 last—\nobserving the setup and hold times (bit D15 is low, \nindicating a write command). \n4) Take CS high (either while SCLK is still high after \nclocking in the last data bit, or after taking SCLK  \nlow).\n5) Take SCLK low (if not already low).\nFigure 4 shows a write operation when 16 bits are  \ntransmitted.\nIt is acceptable to clock more than 16 bits into the \nMAX7301 between taking CS low and taking CS high \nagain. In this case, only the last 16 bits clocked into the \nMAX7301 are retained.Reading Device Registers\nAny register data within the MAX7301 may be read by \nsending a logic high to bit D15. The sequence is: \n1) Take SCLK low.\n2) Take CS low (this enables the internal 16-bit Shift  \nregister).\n3) Clock 16 bits of data into DIN—D15 first to D0 last. \nD15 is high, indicating a read command and bits  \nD14 through D8 containing the address of the reg -\nister to be read. Bits D7–D0 contain dummy data,  \nwhich is discarded. \n4) Take CS high (either while SCLK is still high after \nclocking in the last data bit, or after taking SCLK low), \npositions D7 through D0 in the Shift register are now \nloaded with the register data addressed by bits D14 \nthrough D8. \n5) Take SCLK low (if not already low).\n6) Issue another read or write command (which can \nbe a No-Op), and examine the bit stream at DOUT; \nthe second 8 bits are the contents of the register \naddressed by bits D14 through D8 in step 3.Figure 1.

A detected  \nchange is flagged on port P31, which is used as an  \nactive-high interrupt output (INT). Note that the MAX7301 \ndoes not identify which specific port(s) caused the inter -\nrupt, but provides an alert that one or more port levels \nhave changed. \nThe mask register contains 7 mask bits that select  \nwhich of the seven ports, P24–P30 are to be monitored \n(Table 8). Set the appropriate mask bit to enable that  \nport for transition detect. Clear the mask bit if transi -\ntions on that port are to be ignored. Transition detection  \nworks regardless of whether the port being monitored is \nset to input or output, but generally it is not particularly \nuseful to enable transition detection for outputs.\nPort P31 must be configured as an output in order to  \nwork as the interrupt output INT when transition detec -\ntion is used. Port P31 is set as output by writing bit  \nD7 = 0 and bit D6 = 1 to the port configuration register \n(Table 1).\nTo use transition detection, first set up the mask regis -\nter and configure port P31 as an output, as described \nabove. Then enable transition detection by setting the \nM bit in the configuration register (Table 7). Whenever  the configuration register is written with the M bit set,  \nthe MAX7301 updates an internal 7-bit snapshot register, \nwhich holds the comparison copy of the logic states of \nports P24 through P30. The update action occurs regard -\nless of the previous state of the M bit, so that it is not nec -\nessary to clear the M bit and then set it again to update \nthe snapshot register. \nWhen the configuration register is written with the M bit  \nset, transition detection is enabled and remains  \nenabled until either the configuration register is written \nwith the M bit clear, or a transition is detected. The INT \noutput port P31 goes low, if it was not already low.\nOnce transition detection is enabled, the MAX7301  \ncontinuously compares the snapshot register against  \nthe changing states of P24 through P31. If a change on \nany of the monitored ports is detected, even for a short \ntime (like a pulse), INT output port P31 is latched high. \nThe INT output is not cleared if more changes occur or  \nif the data pattern returns to its original snapshot con -\ndition. The only way to clear INT is to access (read or  \nwrite) the transition detection mask register (Table 8). \nTransition detection is a one-shot event. When INT has \nbeen cleared after responding to a transition event,  \ntransition detection is automatically disabled, even  \nthough the M bit in the configuration register remains  \nset (unless cleared by the user). Reenable transition \ndetection by writing the configuration register with the  \nM bit set, to take a new snapshot of the seven ports  \nP24 to P30.Figure 2. 4-Wire InterfacetCSH tCLtCSS tCH tCSHCS\nSCLK\nDIN\nDOUTtDS\ntDH\ntDO\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 8\nMAX7301 4-Wire-Interfaced, 2.5V to 5.5V,\n20-Port and 28-Port I/O Expander \nExternal Component R ISET\nThe MAX7301 uses an external resistor, R ISET, to set \ninternal biasing. Use a resistor value of 39k W.\nApplications Information\nLow-Voltage Operation\nThe MAX7301 operates down to 2V supply voltage \n(although the sourcing and sinking currents are not  \nguaranteed), providing that the MAX7301 is powered \nup initially to at least 2.5V to trigger the device’s internal \nreset, and also that the serial interface is constrained to \n10Mbps.\nSPI Routing Considerations\nThe MAX7301’s SPI interface is guaranteed to operate \nat 26Mbps on a 2.5V supply, and on a 5V supply typi -\ncally operates at 50Mbps. This means that transmission \nline issues should be considered when the interface \nconnections are longer than 100mm, particularly with \nhigher supply voltages. Ringing manifests itself as com -\nmunication issues, often intermittent, typically due to \ndouble clocking due to ringing at the SCLK input. Fit \na 1kW to 10kW parallel termination resistor to either \nGND or V+ at the DIN, SCLK, and CS input to damp  ringing for moderately long interface runs. Use line-  \nimpedance matching terminations when making connec -\ntions between boards.\nPCB Layout Considerations\nFor the TQFN version, connect the underside exposed \npad to GND. Ensure that all the MAX7301 GND con -\nnections are used. A ground plane is not necessary, but  \nmay be useful to reduce supply impedance if the  \nMAX7301 outputs are to be heavily loaded. Keep the \ntrack length from the ISET pin to the R ISET resistor as \nshort as possible, and take the GND end of the resistor \neither to the ground plane or directly to the ground pins.\nPower-Supply Considerations\nThe MAX7301 operates with power-supply voltages of \n2.5V to 5.5V. Bypass the power supply to GND with a \n0.047µF capacitor as close to the device as possible. \nAdd a 1µF capacitor if the MAX7301 is far away from  \nthe board’s input bulk decoupling capacitor.\nChip Information\nPROCESS: CMOSFigure 4.
