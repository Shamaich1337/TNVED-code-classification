The \npropagation delay from low-to-high (tPLH) is the amount of time \nrequired for an input signal to propagate to the output, causing the output to change from low to high. \nSimilarly, the propagation delay from high-to-low (t\nPHL) is the \namount of time required for the input signal to propagate to the \noutput, causing the output to change from high-to-low (see Figure 9 ).\nPulse-width distortion (PWD) results when t\nPLH and tPHL differ \nin value. PWD is defined as the difference between tPLH and \ntPHL. PWD determines the maximum data rate of a \ntransmission system. PWD can be expressed in percent by \ndividing the PWD (in ns) by the minimum pulse width (in ns) \nbeing transmitted. Typically, a PWD of 20% to 30% of the minimum pulse width is tolerable; the exact figure depends on \nthe particular application (RS232, RS422, T-1, etc.). \nPropagation delay skew, t\nPSK, is an important parameter to \nconsider in parallel data applications where synchronization of \nsignals on parallel data lines is a concern.\nIf the parallel data is being sent through a group of \noptocouplers, differences in propagation delays cause the data to arrive at the outputs of the optocouplers at different times. If \nthis difference in propagation delays is large enough, it \ndetermines the maximum rate at which parallel data can be sent through the optocouplers.\nPropagation delay skew is defined as the difference between \nthe minimum and maximum propagation delays, either t\nPLH or \ntPHL, for any given group of optocouplers which are operating \nFigure 9:  Propagation Delay Skew Waveformunder the same conditions (i.e., the same supply voltage, \noutput load, and operating temperature). As shown in Figure 10 , if the inputs of a group of optocouplers are switched \neither ON or OFF at the same time, t\nPSK is the difference \nbetween the shortest propagation delay, either tPLH or tPHL, and \nthe longest propagation delay, either tPLH or tPHL. As \nmentioned earlier, tPSK can determine the maximum parallel \ndata transmission rate.\nFigure 10  is the timing diagram of a typical parallel data \napplication with both the clock and the data lines being sent \nthrough optocouplers. The figure shows data and clock signals \nat the inputs and outputs of the optocouplers. To obtain the maximum data transmission rate, both edges of the clock \nsignal are being used to clock the data; if only one edge were \nused, the clock signal would need to be twice as fast. \nPropagation delay skew represents the uncertainty of where an \nedge might be after being sent through an optocoupler.\nFigure 10  shows that there will be uncertainty in both the data \nand the clock lines. It is important that these two areas of \nuncertainty not overlap. Otherwise the clock signal might arrive before all of the data outputs have settled, or some of the data outputs might start to change before the clock signal has \narrived.\nFrom these considerations, the absolute minimum pulse width \nthat can be sent through optocouplers in a parallel application is twice t\nPSK. A cautious design should use a slightly longer \npulse width to ensure that any additional uncertainty in the rest \nof the circuit does not cause a problem.\nThe tPSK specified optocouplers offer the advantages of \nguaranteed specifications for propagation delays, pulse-width \ndistortion, and propagation delay skew over the recommended \ntemperature and power supply ranges.\nFigure 10:  Parallel Data Transmission Example\n50%\n50%tPSKVI\nVO\nVI\nVO2.5V,\nCMOS\n2.5V,\nCMOSDATA\nINPUTS\nCLOCK\nDATA\nOUTPUTS\nCLOCK\ntPSKtPSK\nACPL-064L, ACPL-M61L, ACPL-W61L, ACPL-K64L  Data Sheet Low-Power 10-MBd Digital CMOS Optocouplers\nBroadcom AV02-2150EN\n16Optocoupler CMR Performance\nThe principal protection against common-mode noise comes \nfrom the fundamental isolation properties of the optocoupler, and this in turn is directly related to the Input-Output leakage capacitance of the optocoupler.\nTo provide maximum protection to circuitry connected to the \ninput or output of the optocoupler, the leakage capacitance is minimized by having large separation distances at all points \nin the optocoupler construction, including the LED/\nphotodiode interface.\nIn addition to the optocouplers' basic physical construction, \nadditional circuit design steps mitigate the effects of common-mode noise. The most important of these is the Faraday shield on the photodetector stage.\nA Faraday shield is effective in optocouplers because the \ninternal modulation frequency (light) is many orders of magnitude higher than the common-mode noise frequency.\nImproving CMR Performance at \nthe Application Level\nIn an end application, it is desirable that the optocouplers' \ncommon-mode isolation be as close as possible to that indicated in the data sheet specifications. The first step in meeting this goal is to ensure maximum separation between \nPCB interconnects on either side of the optocoupler is \nmaintained and that PCB tracks beneath the optocoupler are avoided. \nIt is inevitable that a certain amount of CMR noise will be \ncoupled into the inputs and this can potentially result in false-triggering of the input. This problem is frequently observed in devices with high input impedance. In some cases, this can cause momentary missing pulses and can even cause input \ncircuitry to latch-up in some alternate technologies.\nThe ACPL-x6xL optocoupler family does not have an input \nlatch-up issue. Even at very high CMR levels, such as those \nexperienced in end equipment level tests (for example IEC61000-4-4), the ACPL-x6xL series is immune to latch-up because of the simple diode structure of the LED.\nIn some cases, achieving the rated data sheet CMR \nperformance level is not possible in an application. This is often because of the practical requirement to actually connect the isolator input to the output of a dynamically changing signal rather than statically tying the input to VDD or GND.To address achievable end application performance on data \nsheets, the ACPL-x6xL optocouplers include an additional typical performance specification for dynamic CMR in the electrical parameter table. The dynamic CMR specification \nindicates the typical achievable CMR performance as the \ninput is toggled on or off during a CMR transient. \nThe logic output of the ACPL-x6xL optocouplers is mainly \ncontrolled by LED current level, and since the LED current \nfeatures very fast rise and fall times, dynamic noise immunity is essentially the same as static noise immunity. \nDespite their immunity to input latch-up and the excellent \ndynamic CMR immunity, ACPL-x6xL optocoupler devices are still potentially vulnerable to misoperation caused by turning the LED either on or off during a CMR disturbance. If the LED status could be ensured by design, the overall application \nlevel CMR performance would be that of the photodetector. \nTo benefit from the inherently high CMR capabilities of the ACPL-x6xL family, take the following precautions when operating the LED at the application level.\nIn particular, ensure that the LED stays either on or off during \na CMR transient. Some common design techniques to accomplish this include the following:\nKeep the LED On:\n1. Overdrive the LED with a higher-than-required forward \ncurrent.\nKeep the LED Off:\n1. Reverse bias the LED during the off state.2. Minimize the off-state impedance across the anode and \ncathode of the LED during the off state.\nAll of these methods allow the full CMR capability of the \nACPL-x6xL family to be achieved, but they do have practical \nimplementation issues or require a compromise on power \nconsumption.\nThere is, however, an effective method to meet the goal of \nmaintaining the LED status during a CMR event with no other design compromises other than a single added resistor.\nThis CMR optimization takes advantage of the differential \nconnection to the LED. By ensuring the common-mode impedances at both the cathode and anode of the LED are equal, the CMR transient on the LED is effectively canceled. As shown in Figure 11 , this is easily achieved by using two, \ninstead of one, input bias resistors.\nBroadcom AV02-2150EN\n17ACPL-064L, ACPL-M61L, ACPL-W61L, ACPL-K64L  Data Sheet Low-Power 10-MBd Digital CMOS Optocouplers\nSplit LED Bias Resistor for \nOptimum CMR\nFigure 11  shows the recommended drive circuit for the \nACPL-x6xL that gives optimum common-mode rejection. The two current-setting resistors balance the common-\nmode impedances at the LED’s anode and cathode. \nCommon-mode transients can capacitively couple from the LED anode (or cathode) to the output-side ground causing \ncurrent to be shunted away from the LED (which is not \nwanted when the LED should be on) or conversely causing current to be injected into the LED (which is not wanted \nwhen the LED should be off). \nFigure 12  shows the parasitic capacitances (C\nLA and CLC) \nbetween the LED’s anode and cathode, and output ground. \nAlso shown in Figure 12  on the input side is an AC-\nequivalent circuit.\nTable 1  shows that the directions of ILP and ILN depend on \nthe polarity of the common- mode transient. For transients \noccurring when the LED is on, common-mode rejection (CM\nL, since the output is at low state) depends on LED \ncurrent (IF).For conditions where IF is close to the switching threshold \n(ITH), CML also depends on the extent to which ILP and ILN \nbalance each other. In other words, any condition where a \ncommon-mode transient causes a momentary decrease in I\nF (meaning when dVCM/dt > 0 and |IFP| > |IFN|, referring to \nTable 1 ) also causes a common-mode failure for transients \nthat are fast enough.\nLikewise, for a common-mode transient that occurs when \nthe LED is off (meaning CMH, since the output is at high \nstate), if an imbalance between ILP and ILN results in a \ntransient IF equal to or greater than the switching threshold \nof the optocoupler, the transient  signal can cause the output \nto spike below 2V, which constitutes a CMH failure. \nThe resistors recommended in Figure 11  include both the \noutput impedance of the logic dr iver circuit and the external \nlimiting resistor. The balanced ILED-setting resistors help \nequalize the common-mode voltage change at the anode \nand cathode. This reduces ILED changes caused by \ntransient coupling through the parasitic capacitors CLA and \nCLC shown in Figure 12 .\nFigure 11:  Recommended High-CMR Drive Circuit for the ACPL-x6xLFor ACPL-M61L/W61L:\nVDD = 3.3V: R1 = 510Ω ± 1%, R2 = 360Ω ± 1% \nVDD = 5.0V: R1 = 1000Ω ± 1%, R2 = 680Ω ± 1%\nRT = R1 + R2    R1/R2 = 1.5For ACPL-064L/K64L:\nVDD = 3.3V: R1 = 430Ω ± 1%, R2 = 430Ω ± 1%\nVDD = 5.0V: R1 = 845Ω ± 1%, R2 = 845Ω ± 1%\nRT = R1 + R2    R1/R2 = 1\nVDD\nGND 2VDD2\n0.1\x03μF\nGND 1R2R1\nShieldVO\n74LS04 or any\ntotem-pole outputlogic gate \nBroadcom AV02-2150EN\n18ACPL-064L, ACPL-M61L, ACPL-W61L, ACPL-K64L  Data Sheet Low-Power 10-MBd Digital CMOS Optocouplers\nFigure 12:  AC Equivalent Circuit of ACPL-x6xLFor ACPL-M61L/W61L:\nVDD = 3.3V: R1 = 510Ω ± 1%, R2 = 360Ω ± 1% \nVDD = 5.0V: R1 = 1000Ω ± 1%, R2 = 680Ω ± 1%\nRT = R1 + R2    R1/R2 = 1.5For ACPL-064L/K64L:\nVDD = 3.3V: R1 = 430Ω ± 1%, R2 = 430Ω ± 1%\nVDD = 5.0V: R1 = 845Ω ± 1%, R2 = 845Ω ± 1%\nRT = R1 + R2    R1/R2 = 1\nTable 1:  Common-Mode Pulse Polarity and LED Current Transient\ndVCM/dt ValueResultant ILP Flow \nDirectionResultant ILN Flow \nDirectionIf |ILP| < |ILN|, LED current IF \nis momentarily:If |ILP| > |ILN|, LED current IF \nis momentarily:\nPositive (> 0) Away from the LED\nanode through CLAAway from the LEDcathode through C\nLCIncreased Decreased\nNegative (< 0) Toward the LED\nanode through CLAToward the LEDcathode through C\nLCDecreased IncreasedGND 2VOVDD2\n0.1\x03μFR1\nShieldR2\nILNILP\nCLCCLA\nACPL-064L, ACPL-M61L, ACPL-W61L, ACPL-K64L  Data Sheet Low-Power 10-MBd Digital CMOS Optocouplers\nBroadcom AV02-2150EN\n19Slew-Rate Controlled Outputs \nFeature\nTypically, the output slew rate (rise and fall time) varies with \nthe output load, as more time is required to charge up the higher load.
