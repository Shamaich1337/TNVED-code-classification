All Rights Reserved.  \nFunctional Description  \nPFM/PWM Operation  \nEach  of the buck regulators can be operated at PFM/PWM mode.  If the output current is  less than \n150mA (typ.), the regulators automatically enters the PFM mode.  The output voltages and output \nripples at PFM mode are higher than the output voltages and output ripples at PWM mode.  But at \nvery light load, the PFM mode operation provides high er efficiency than PWM mode operation.  \n \nEnable Control  \nThe EA3059  is a high efficiency Power Management IC which is designed for OTT applications.  It \nincorporates four 2A synchronous buck regulators  and can be controlled by individual EN pin s.  \nThe start -up time for each channel can be progr ammed by using the circuit shown as below:  \nGNDENxVINx\n10nF~100nFVINX\n5V\nEA3059100KΩ\n \n \n180° Phase s Shift ed Architecture  \nIn order  to reduce the input ripple current, the EA3059  applied 180 ° phase s shifted architecture.  \nBuck1 and Buck 3 have the same phase and Buck2 and Buck4 are 180 ° out of phase.  This \narchitecture allows the system board has less ripple current, and thus can reduce EMI.  \n \nOver Current Protection  \nThe EA3059  internal four regulators have their own cycle -by-cycle current  limit circuits.  When the \ninductor peak current exceeds the current limit threshold , the output voltage starts to drop until FB \npin voltage is below the threshold, typically 30% below the reference.  Once the threshold is \ntriggered, the switching frequenc y is reduced to 350KHz (typ.).  \n \nThermal Shutdown  \nThe EA3059  will automatically disabled if the die temperature is higher than the thermal shutdown \nthreshold point.  To avoid unstable operation, the hysteresis of thermal shutdown is about 30 °C.   \n \n  \n \n11 Datasheet  EA3059  \n4-CH Power Management IC  \n \n \nVer. 1.2 Copyright © 2014 Everanalog  Integrated Circuit Limited.  All Rights Reserved.  \nApplica tion Information  \nOutput Voltage Setting  \nEach of the regulators output voltage can be set via a resistor divider ( ex. R1, R2). The output \nvoltage is calculated by following equation:  \n\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02b OUT1R1V 0.6 0.6 VR2\n \nGNDLX1\nEA3059C10\n220pFVOUT1\nFB1R1\n68KΩ\nR2\n82KΩ1.1VL1\n1.5uH\n \n \nThe following tab le lists common  output voltage and the corresponding R1, R2 resistance value for \nreference.  \nOutput Voltage  R1 Resistance  R2 Resistance  Tolerance  \n3.3V 510KΩ 110KΩ 1% \n1.8V 200KΩ 100KΩ 1% \n1.5V 150KΩ 100KΩ 1% \n1.1V 68KΩ 82KΩ 1% \n \nInput / Output Capacitors  Selection  \nThe input capacitors are used to suppress the noise amplitude of the input voltage and provide  a \nstable and clean DC input to the device.  Because  the ceramic capacitor has low ESR \ncharacteristic, so it is suitable for input capacitor use.   It is recommended to use X5R or X7R \nMLCC capacitors in order to have better temperature performance and smaller capacitance \ntolerance.   In order to suppress the output voltage ripple, the MLCC capacitor is also the best \nchoice.  The suggested part numbers of input / output capacitors are as follows:  \nVendor  Part Number  Capacitance  Edc Parameter  Size \nTDK C2012 X5R1A 106M 10uF 10V X5R 0805  \nTDK C3216 X5R1A 106M  10uF 10V X5R 1206  \nTDK C2012 X5R1A 226M  22uF 10V X5R 0805  \nTDK C3216 X5R1A226M  22uF 10V X5R 1206  \n \nOutput Inductor  Selection  \nThe output inductor selection mainly depends on the amount of ripple current through the inductor \n∆IL.  Large  ∆IL will cause larger output vo ltage ripple and loss, but the user can use a smaller \ninductor to save cost and space.  On the contrary, the larger inductance can get smaller ∆IL and \n \n   12 EA3059  \nDatasheet  4-CH Power Management IC  \nVer. 1.2 Copyright © 2014 Everanalog  Integrated Circuit Limited.

The \ninduc tor value can be calculated as:  \nPWR OUT OUT\nL SW PWRV V VLΔI F V\uf02d\uf03d\uf0b4\uf0b4\n \nFor most applications, 1. 0uH to 2.2uH inductors are suitable for EA3059 . \n \nPower Dissipation  \nThe total output power dissipation of EA3059  should not to exceed the maximum 10W range.

For EA3059  PCB layout considerations , please refe r to \nthe following suggestions to get best performance.   \n\uf075 It is sugg ested to use 4 -layer PCB layout and place LX plane and output plane on the top \nlayer, place VIN plane in the inner layer.  \n\uf075 The top layer SMD input and output capacitors ground plane should be connected to the \ninternal ground layer and bottom ground plane individually by using vias .  \n\uf075 The AGND should be connected to inner ground layer directly by using via.  \n\uf075 High current path traces need to be widened.  \n\uf075 Place the input capacitors as close as possible to the VINx  pin to reduce noise \ninterference.  \n\uf075 Keep the feedbac k path (from V OUT X to FB x) away from the noise node (ex. LXx). LXx is a \nhigh current noise node. Complete the layout by using short and wide traces.  \n\uf075 The top layer exposed pad ground plane should be connected to the internal ground layer \nand bottom ground p lane by using a number of vias to improve thermal performance . \n\uf075 Place the input capacitors as close as possible to the VINx  pin to reduce noise \ninterference.  \n \n  \nPCB top layer  PCB GND layer  \n  \nPCB power layer  PCB bottom layer  \n  \n\n \n13 Datasheet  EA3059  \n4-CH Power Management IC  \n \n \nVer. 1.2 Copyright © 2014 Everanalog  Integrated Circuit Limited.
