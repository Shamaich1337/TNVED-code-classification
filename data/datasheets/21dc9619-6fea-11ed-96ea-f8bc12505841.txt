Power levels of 20W or more can be \ncontrolled with conversion efficiencies of over 90%. The \n1.8V to 28V input voltage range supports a wide range of \nbattery and AC-powered inputs. An advanced BiCMOS \ndesign features low operating current (220μA), adjustable \noperating frequency (100kHz to 500kHz), soft-start, and \na SYNC input allowing the MAX668/MAX669 oscillator to \nbe locked to an external clock.\nDC-DC conversion efficiency is optimized with a low \n100mV current-sense voltage as well as with Maxim’s \nproprietary Idle Mode™ control scheme. The controller \noperates in PWM mode at medium and heavy loads for \nlowest noise and optimum efficiency, then pulses only as \nneeded (with reduced inductor current) to reduce operating \ncurrent and maximize efficiency under light loads. A logic-\nlevel shutdown input is also included, reducing supply \ncurrent to 3.5μA.\nThe MAX669, optimized for low input voltages with a \nguaranteed start-up voltage of 1.8V, requires bootstrapped \noperation (IC powered from boosted output). It supports \noutput voltages up to 28V. The MAX668 operates with \ninputs as low as 3V and can be connected in either a boot -\nstrapped or non-bootstrapped (IC powered from input sup -\nply or other source) configuration. When not bootstrapped, \nit has no restriction on output voltage. Both ICs are avail -\nable in an extremely compact 10-pin μMAX package.Benefits and Features\n ●1.8V Minimum Start-Up Voltage (MAX669)\n ●Wide Input Voltage Range (1.8V to 28V)\n ●Tiny 10-Pin μMAX Package\n ●Current-Mode PWM and Idle Mode™ Operation\n ●Efficiency over 90%\n ●Adjustable 100kHz to 500kHz Oscillator or  \nSYNC Input\n ●220μA Quiescent Current\n ●Logic-Level Shutdown\n ●Soft-Start\nApplications\n ●Cellular Telephones\n ●Telecom Hardware\n ●LANs and Network Systems\n ●POS Systems\n19-4778; Rev 3; 6/16Idle Mode is a trademark of Maxim Integrated Products.\n+ Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\nT = Tape and reel.\n/V Denotes an automotive qualified part.\nNote:  Devices are also available in a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-\ncompliant package.

Optimum conversion efficiency is maintained \nover a wide range of loads by employing both PWM \noperation and Maxim’s proprietary Idle Mode control to \nminimize operating current at light loads. Other features \ninclude shutdown, adjustable internal operating frequency \nor synchronization to an external clock, soft start, adjustable \ncurrent limit, and a wide (1.8V to 28V) input range.\nMAX668 vs. MAX669 Differences\nDifferences between the MAX668 and MAX669 relate \nto their use in bootstrapped or non-bootstrapped circuits \n(Table 1). The MAX668 operates with inputs as low \nas 3V and can be connected in either  a bootstrapped \nor non-bootstrapped (IC powered from input supply or \nother source) configuration. When not bootstrapped, the \nMAX668 has no restriction on output voltage. When boot -\nstrapped, the output cannot exceed 28V.\nThe MAX669 is optimized for low input voltages (down to \n1.8V) and requires  bootstrapped operation (IC powered \nfrom V OUT) with output voltages no greater than 28V. \nBootstrapping is required because the MAX669 does not have undervoltage lockout, but instead drives EXT with \nan open-loop, 50% duty-cycle start-up oscillator when \nLDO is below 2.5V. It switches to closed-loop operation \nonly when LDO exceeds 2.5V. If a non-bootstrapped \nconnection is used with the MAX669 and if V CC (the \ninput voltage) remains below 2.7V, the output voltage will \nsoar above the regulation point. Table 2  recommends the \nappropriate device for each biasing option.\nTable 1. MAX668/MAX669 ComparisonPIN NAME FUNCTION\n1 LDO5V On-Chip Regulator Output.

The main PWM comparator is direct summing, \nlacking a traditional error amplifier and its associated \nphase shift. The direct summing configuration approaches \nideal cycle-by-cycle control over the output voltage since \nthere is no conventional error amp in the feedback path.\nIn PWM mode, the controller uses fixed-frequency, \ncurrent-mode operation where the duty ratio is set by the \ninput/output voltage ratio (duty ratio = (V OUT - VIN)/VIN \nin the boost configuration). The current-mode feedback \nloop regulates peak inductor current as a function of the \noutput error signal.\nAt light loads the controller enters Idle mode. During Idle \nmode, switching pulses are provided only as needed to \nservice the load, and operating current is minimized to \nprovide best light-load efficiency. The minimum-current \ncomparator threshold is 15mV, or 15% of the full-load \nvalue (I MAX) of 100mV. When the controller is synchro -\nnized to an external clock, Idle Mode occurs only at very \nlight loads.Bootstrapped/Non-Bootstrapped Operation\nLow-Dropout Regulator (LDO)\nSeveral IC biasing options, including bootstrapped and \nnon-bootstrapped operation, are made possible by an \non-chip, low-dropout 5V regulator. The regulator input is \nat V CC, while its output is at LDO. All MAX668/MAX669 \nfunctions, including EXT, are internally powered from \nLDO. The V CC-to-LDO dropout voltage is typically 200mV \n(300mV max at 12mA), so that when V CC is less than \n5.2V, LDO is typically V CC - 200mV. When LDO is in drop -\nout, the MAX668/MAX669 still operate with V CC as low \nas 3V (as long as LDO exceeds 2.7V), but with reduced \namplitude FET drive at EXT. The maximum V CC input \nvoltage is 28V.\nLDO can supply up to 12mA to power the IC, supply \ngate charge through EXT to the external FET, and supply \nsmall external loads. When driving particularly large FETs \nat high switching rates, little or no LDO current may be \navailable for external loads. For example, when switched \nat 500kHz, a large FET with 20nC gate charge requires \n20nC x 500kHz, or 10mA.\nVCC and LDO allow a variety of biasing connections to \noptimize efficiency, circuit quiescent current, and full-load \nstart-up behavior for different input and output voltage \nranges. Connections are shown in Figure 2 , Figure 3 , \nFigure 4 , and Figure 5 . The characteristics of each are \noutlined in Table 1 .\nFigure 1.

This improves efficiency when \nthe input voltage is low, since EXT drives the FET with \na higher gate voltage than would be available from the \nlow-voltage input. Higher gate voltage reduces the FET \non-resistance, increasing efficiency. Other (undesirable) \ncharacteristics of bootstrapped operation are increased \nIC operating power (since it has a higher operating \nvoltage) and reduced ability to start up with high load current at low input voltages. If the input voltage range \nextends below 2.7V, then bootstrapped operation with the \nMAX669 is the only option.\nWith V CC connected to V OUT, as in Figure 2, EXT voltage \nswing is 5V when V CC is 5.2V or more, and V CC - 0.2V \nwhen V CC is less than 5.2V. If the output voltage does \nnot exceed 5.5V, the on-chip regulator can be disabled \nby connecting V CC to LDO ( Figure 3 ). This eliminates the \nLDO forward drop and supplies maximum gate drive to \nthe external FET.Figure 2. MAX669 High-Voltage Bootstrapped Configuration\nFigure 3.

Non-bootstrapped operation ( Figure 4 ) is recommended  \n(but not required) for input voltages above 5V, since the \nEXT amplitude (limited to 5V by LDO) at this voltage range \nis no higher than it would be with bootstrapped operation. \nNote that non-bootstrapped operation is required  if the \noutput voltage exceeds 28V, since this level is too high to \nsafely connect to V CC. Also note that only the MAX668 \ncan be used with non-bootstrapped operation .If the input voltage does not exceed 5.5V, the on-chip  \nregulator can be disabled by connecting V CC to LDO \n(Figure 5 ). This eliminates the regulator forward drop \nand supplies the maximum gate drive to the external \nFET for lowest on-resistance. Disabling the regulator also \nreduces the non-bootstrapped minimum input voltage \nfrom 3V to 2.7V.Figure 4. MAX668 High-Voltage Non-Bootstrapped Configuration\nFigure 5.

If V OUT never \nexceeds 5.5V, LDO may be shorted to V CC and V OUT \nto eliminate the dropout voltage of the LDO regulator.\n2) If VIN is greater than 3.0V, V CC can be powered from \nVIN, rather than from V OUT (non-bootstrapped). This \ncan save quiescent power consumption, especially \nwhen V OUT is large. If V IN never exceeds 5.5V, LDO \nmay be shorted to V CC and V IN to eliminate the drop -\nout voltage of the LDO regulator.3) If VIN is in the 3V to 4.5V range (i.e., 1-cell Li-Ion or \n3-cell NiMH battery range), bootstrapping V CC from \nVOUT, although not required, may increase overall \nefficiency by increasing gate drive (and reducing \nFET resistance) at the expense of quiescent power  \nconsumption.\n4) If VIN always exceeds 4.5V, V CC should be tied to V IN, \nsince bootstrapping from V OUT does not increase gate \ndrive from EXT but does increase quiescent power  \ndissipation.Table 2. Bootstrapped and Non-Bootstrapped Configurations\n* For standard step-up DC-DC circuits (as in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5), regulation cannot be maintained if V IN exceeds V OUT. SEPIC \nand transformer-based circuits do not have this limitation.CONFIGURATION FIGUREUSE \nWITH:INPUT \nVOLTAGE \nRANGE* (V)OUTPUT \nVOLTAGE \nRANGE (V)COMMENTS\nHigh-Voltage, \nBootstrappedFigure2 MAX669 1.8 to 28 3V to 28Connect V CC to V OUT.

When \nSYNC/ SHDN  is low, all IC functions are shut down. A logic \nhigh at SYNC/ SHDN  selects operation at a frequency set \nby R OSC, connected from FREQ to GND. The relationship \nbetween f OSC and R OSC is:\nROSC = 5 x 10 10/fOSC\nSo a 500kHz operating frequency, for example, is set with \nROSC = 100kΩ.\nRising clock edges on SYNC/ SHDN  are interpreted as \nsynchronization inputs. If the sync signal is lost while \nSYNC/ SHDN  is high, the internal oscillator takes over at \nthe end of the last cycle and the frequency is returned \nto the rate set by R OSC. If sync is lost with SYNC/\nSHDN  low, the IC waits for 70μs before shutting down. \nThis maintains output regulation even with intermittent \nsync signals. When an external sync signal is used, Idle \nmode switchover at the 15mV current-sense threshold is  \ndisabled so that Idle mode only occurs at very light loads. \nAlso, R OSC should be set for a frequency 15% below the \nSYNC clock rate:\nROSC(SYNC)  = 5 x 10 10 / (0.85 x f SYNC )\nSoft-Start\nThe MAX668/MAX669 feature a “digital” soft start which is \npreset and requires no external capacitor. Upon startup, \nthe peak inductor increments from 1/5 of the value set by \nRCS, to the full current-limit value, in five steps over 1024 \ncycles of f OSC or f SYNC . For example, with an f OSC of \n200kHz, the complete soft-start sequence takes 5ms. See \nthe Typical Operating Characteristics  for a photo of soft-\nstart operation. Soft-start is implemented: 1) when power \nis first applied to the IC, 2) when exiting shutdown with \npower already applied, and 3) when exiting undervoltage \nlockout. The MAX669’s soft-start sequence does not start \nuntil LDO reaches 2.5V.\nDesign Procedure\nThe MAX668/MAX669 can operate in a number of \nDCDC converter configurations including step-up, SEPIC \n(single-ended primary inductance converter), and flyback. \nThe following design discussions are limited to step-up, \nalthough SEPIC and flyback examples are shown in the \nApplication Circuits  section.Setting the Operating Frequency\nThe MAX668/MAX669 can be set to operate from 100kHz \nto 500kHz. Choice of operating frequency will depend on \nnumber of factors:\n1) Noise considerations may dictate setting (or synchronizing) \nfOSC above or below a certain frequency or band of \nfrequencies, particularly in RF applications.\n2) Higher frequencies allow the use of smaller value \n(hence smaller size) inductors and capacitors.\n3) Higher frequencies consume more operating power \nboth to operate the IC and to charge and discharge \nthe gate of the external FET. This tends to reduce  \nefficiency at light loads; however, the MAX668/\nMAX669’s Idle mode feature substantially increases \nlight-load efficiency.\n4) Higher frequencies may exhibit poorer overall efficiency \ndue to more transition losses in the FET; however, this \nshortcoming can often be nullified by trading some \nof the inductor and capacitor size benefits for lower-\nresistance components.\nThe oscillator frequency is set by a resistor, R OSC,  \nconnected from FREQ to GND. R OSC must be connected \nwhether or not the part is externally synchronized R OSC \nis in each case:\nROSC = 5 x 10 10 / fOSC\nwhen not using an external clock.\nROSC(SYNC)  = 5 x 10 10 / (0.85 x f SYNC ) \nwhen using an external clock, f SYNC .\nSetting the Output Voltage\nThe output voltage is set by two external resistors (R2 \nand R3, Figure 2 , Figure 3 , Figure 4 , and Figure 5 ). First \nselect a value for R3 in the 10kΩ to 1MΩ range. R2 is \nthen given by:\nR2 = R3 [(V OUT/VREF) – 1]\nwhere V REF is 1.25V.\nDetermining Inductance Value\nFor most MAX668/MAX669 boost designs, the inductor \nvalue (L IDEAL ) can be derived from the following equation, \nwhich picks the optimum value for stability based on the \nMAX668/MAX669’s internally set slope compensation:\nLIDEAL  = VOUT / (4 x I OUT x fOSC)\nMAX668/MAX669 1.8V to 28V Input, PWM Step-Up\nControllers in μMAX\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 13\nThe MAX668/MAX669 allow significant latitude in inductor \nselection if L IDEAL  is not a convenient value. This may \nhappen if L IDEAL  is a not a standard inductance (such as \n10μH, 22μH, etc.), or if L IDEAL  is too large to be obtained \nwith suitable resistance and saturation-current rating in \nthe desired size. Inductance values smaller than L IDEAL  \nmay be used with no adverse stability effects; however, \nthe peak-to-peak inductor current (I LPP) will rise as L is \nreduced. This has the effect of raising the required I LPK \nfor a given output power and also requiring larger output \ncapacitance to maintain a given output ripple. An induc -\ntance value larger than L IDEAL  may also be used, but \noutput-filter capacitance must be increased by the same \nproportion that L has to L IDEAL . See the Capacitor \nSelection  section for more information on determining \noutput filter values.\nDue to the MAX668/MAX669’s high switching frequencies, \ninductors with any core materials that exhibit low core \nloss (ferrite, or equivalent) are recommended for best \nefficiency performance.\nDetermining Peak Inductor Current\nThe peak inductor current required for a particular output is:\nILPEAK  = ILDC + (ILPP / 2)\nwhere I LDC is the average DC input current and I LPP is \nthe inductor peak-to-peak ripple current. The I LDC and \nILPP terms are determined as follows:\nOUT OUT DLDC\nIN SWI  (V + V )I  = (V  – V )\nwhere V D is the forward voltage drop across the Schottky \nrectifier diode (D1), and V SW is the drop across the external \nFET, when on.\nIN SW OUT D INLPP\nOSC OUT D(V  – V ) (V  + V  – V )I  = L x  f  (V  + V )\nwhere L is the inductor value. The saturation rating \nof the selected inductor should meet or exceed the  \ncalculated value for I LPEAK , although most coil types can \nbe operated up to 20% over their saturation rating without \ndifficulty. In addition to the saturation criteria, the inductor \nshould have as low a series resistance as possible. For \ncontinuous inductor current, the power loss in the inductor \nresistance, P LR, is approximated by:\nPLR ≅ (IOUT x VOUT / VIN)2 x RL\nwhere R L is the inductor series resistance.\nOnce the peak inductor current is selected, the current -\nsense resistor (R CS) is determined by:\nRCS = 85mV / I LPEAKFor high peak inductor currents (>1A), Kelvin sensing \nconnections should be used to connect CS+ and PGND \nto R CS. PGND and GND should be tied together at the \nground side of R CS.\nPower MOSFET Selection\nThe MAX668/MAX669 drive a wide variety of N-channel \npower MOSFETs (NFETs). Since LDO limits the EXT output \ngate drive to no more than 5V, a logic-level NFET is \nrequired. Best performance, especially at low input voltag -\nes (below 5V), is achieved with low-threshold NFETs that \nspecify on-resistance with a gate-source voltage (V GS) of \n2.7V or less. When selecting an NFET, key parameters \ncan include:\n1) Total gate charge (Q g)\n2) Reverse transfer capacitance or charge (C RSS)\n3) On-resistance (R DS(ON) )\n4) Maximum drain-to-source voltage (V DS(MAX) )\n5) Minimum threshold voltage (V TH(MIN) )\nAt high switching rates, dynamic characteristics (parameters \n1 and 2 above) that predict switching losses may have more \nimpact on efficiency than R DS(ON) , which predicts DC losses. \nQg includes all capacitances associated with charging the \ngate. In addition, this parameter helps predict the current \nneeded to drive the gate at the selected operating frequency. \nThe continuous LDO current for the FET gate is:\nIGATE  = Q g x fOSC\nFor example, the MMFT3055L has a typical Q g of 7nC \n(at V GS = 5V); therefore, the I GATE  current at 500kHz is \n3.5mA. Use the FET manufacturer’s typical  value for Q g in \nthe above equation, since a maximum value (if supplied) is \nusually too conservative to be of use in estimating I GATE .\nDiode Selection\nThe MAX668/MAX669’s high switching frequency \ndemands a high-speed rectifier. Schottky diodes are \nrecommended for most applications because of their fast \nrecovery time and low forward voltage. Ensure that the \ndiode’s average current rating is adequate using the diode \nmanufacturer’s data, or approximate it with the following \nformula:\n= +LPEAK OUTDIODE OUTI - III3\nAlso, the diode reverse breakdown voltage must exceed \nVOUT. For high output voltages (50V or above), Schottky \ndiodes may not be practical because of this voltage \nrequirement. In these cases, use a high-speed silicon \nrectifier with adequate reverse voltage.\nMAX668/MAX669 1.8V to 28V Input, PWM Step-Up\nControllers in μMAX\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 14\nCapacitor Selection\nOutput Filter Capacitor\nThe minimum output filter capacitance that ensures stability is:\nIDEALOUT(MIN)\nCS IN(MIN) OSC(7.5V L / L )C(2 R V f )×=π× ×\nwhere V IN(MIN)  is the minimum expected input voltage. \nTypically C OUT(MIN) , though sufficient for stability, will not \nbe adequate for low output voltage ripple. Since output \nripple in boost DC-DC designs is dominated by capacitor \nequivalent series resistance (ESR), a capacitance value 2 \nor 3 times larger than C OUT(MIN)  is typically needed. Low-\nESR types must be used. Output ripple due to ESR is:\nVRIPPLE(ESR)  = ILPEAK  x ESR COUT\nInput Capacitor\nThe input capacitor (C IN) in boost designs reduces the \ncurrent peaks drawn from the input supply and reduces \nnoise injection. The value of C IN is largely determined by \nthe source impedance of the input supply. High source \nimpedance requires high input capacitance, particularly \nas the input voltage falls. Since step-up DC-DC converters \nact as “constant-power” loads to their input supply, input \ncurrent rises as input voltage falls. Consequently, in low-\ninput-voltage designs, increasing C IN and/or lowering its  \nESR can add as many as five percentage points to  \nconversion efficiency. A good starting point is to use the \nsame capacitance value for C IN as for C OUT.\nBypass Capacitors\nIn addition to C IN and C OUT, three ceramic bypass \ncapacitors are also required with the MAX668/MAX669. \nBypass REF to GND with 0.22μF or more. Bypass LDO \nto GND with 1μF or more. And bypass V CC to GND with \n0.1μF or more. All bypass capacitors should be located as \nclose to their respective pins as possible.\nCompensation Capacitor\nOutput ripple voltage due to C OUT ESR affects loop \nstability by introducing a left half-plane zero. A small \ncapacitor connected from FB to GND forms a pole with \nthe feedback resistance that cancels the ESR zero. The \noptimum compensation value is:\n=\n COUTFB OUTESRC C  x (R2 x R3) / (R2 + R3)\nwhere R2 and R3 are the feedback resistors ( Figure 2 , \nFigure 3 , Figure 4 , and Figure 5 ). If the calculated value \nfor C FB results in a non-standard capacitance value, \nvalues from 0.5C FB to 1.5C FB will also provide sufficient \ncompensation.Applications Information\nStarting Under Load\nIn non-bootstrapped configurations ( Figure 4 , and Figure 5),  \nthe MAX668 can start up with any combination of  \noutput load and input voltage at which it can operate \nwhen already started. In other words, there are no special  \nlimitations to start up in non-bootstrapped circuits.\nIn bootstrapped configurations with the MAX668 or \nMAX669, there may be circumstances where full load  \ncurrent can only be applied after the circuit has  \nstarted and the output is near its set value. As the input  \nvoltage drops, this limitation becomes more severe. This  \ncharacteristic of all bootstrapped designs occurs when the \nMOSFET gate is not fully driven until the output voltage \nrises. This is problematic because a heavily loaded output \ncannot rise until the MOSFET has low on-resistance. In \nsuch situations, low-threshold FETs (V TH < V IN(MIN) ) \nare the most effective solution. The Typical Operating \nCharacteristics  section shows plots of startup voltage  \nversus load current for a typical bootstrapped design.\nLayout Considerations\nDue to high current levels and fast switching waveforms \nthat radiate noise, proper PC board layout is essential. \nProtect sensitive analog grounds by using a star ground \nconfiguration. Minimize ground noise by connecting GND, \nPGND, the input bypass-capacitor ground lead, and the \noutput-filter ground lead to a single point (star ground \nconfiguration). Also, minimize trace lengths to reduce \nstray capacitance, trace resistance, and radiated noise. \nThe trace between the external gain-setting resistors and \nthe FB pin must be extremely short, as must the trace \nbetween GND and PGND.\nApplication Circuits\nLow-Voltage Boost Circuit\nFigure 3  shows the MAX669 operating in a low-voltage \nboost application. The MAX669 is configured in the boot -\nstrapped mode to improve low input voltage performance. \nThe IRF7401 nMOSFET was selected for Q1 in this appli -\ncation because of its very low 0.7V gate threshold voltage \n(VGS). This circuit provides a 5V output at greater than 2A \nof output current and operates with input voltages as low \nas 1.8V. Efficiency is typically in the 85% to 90% range.\nMAX668/MAX669 1.8V to 28V Input, PWM Step-Up\nControllers in μMAX\nwww.maximintegrated.com\nMaxim Integrated  │ 15\n+12V Boost Application\nFigure 5 shows the MAX668 operating in a 5V to \n12V boost application. This circuit provides output  \ncurrents of greater than 1A at a typical efficiency of 92%. \nThe MAX668 is operated in non-bootstrapped mode to  \nminimize the input supply current. This achieves  \nmaximum light-load efficiency. If input voltages below \n5V are used, the IC should be operated in bootstrapped \nmode to achieve best low-voltage performance.\n4-Cell to +5V SEPIC Power Supply\nFigure 6  shows the MAX668 in a SEPIC (single-ended \nprimary inductance converter) configuration. This configuration \nis useful when the input voltage can be either larger or \nsmaller than the output voltage, such as when converting \nfour NiMH, NiCd, or Alkaline cells to a 5V output. The \nSEPIC configuration is often a good choice for combined \nstep-up/step-down applications.\nThe nMOSFET (Q1) must be selected to withstand a \ndrain-to-source voltage (V DS) greater than the sum of the \ninput and output voltages. The coupling capacitor (C2) \nmust be a low-ESR type to achieve maximum efficiency. C2 must also be able to handle high ripple currents; \nordinary tantalum capacitors should not be used for high-\ncurrent designs.\nThe circuit in Figure 6  provides greater than 1A output  \ncurrent at 5V when operating with an input voltage from 3V \nto 25V. Efficiency will typically be between 70% and 85%, \ndepending upon the input voltage and output current.\nIsolated +5V to +5V Power Supply\nThe circuit of Figure 7  provides a 5V isolated output at \n400mA from a 5V input power supply. Transformer T1 \nprovides electrical isolation for the forward path of the \nconverter, while the TLV431 shunt regulator and MOC211 \nopto-isolator provide an isolated feedback error voltage \nfor the converter. The output voltage is set by resistors \nR2 and R3 such that the mid-point of the divider is 1.24V \n(threshold of TLV431). Output voltage can be adjusted \nfrom 1.24V to 6V by selecting the proper ratio for R2 and \nR3. For output voltages greater than 6V, substitute the \nTL431 for the TLV431, and use 2.5V as the voltage at the \nmidpoint of the voltage-divider.\nFigure 6.
