Please take forward and reverse loss into consideration during design. \nThe absolute maximum ratings denote the absolute maximu m ratings, which are rated values and must not be \nexceeded during operation, even for an  instant. The following are the genera l derating methods that we recommend \nwhen you design a circuit with a device. \nVRRM : Use this rating with reference to the above. V RRM  has a temperature coefficient of 0.1%/°C. Take \nthis temperature coefficient into account designing a device at low temperature. \nIF(AV) : We recommend that the worst case current be no  greater than 80% of the absolute maximum rating \nof IF(AV)  and T j be below 100°C. When using this device, take the margin into consideration by \nusing an allowable T ℓ max - I F(AV) curve. \nIFSM: This rating specifies the non-repetitive peak curren t. This is only applied for an abnormal operation, \nwhich seldom occurs during the lifespan of the device. \nTj: Derate this rating when using a device in order to ensure high reliability. We recommend that the \ndevice be used at a T j of below 100°C. \nThermal resistance between junction and ambient fluctuat es depending on the device’s mounting condition. When \nusing a device, please design a circuit board and a solderin g land size to match the appropriate thermal resistance \nvalue. \nPlease refer to the Rectifiers Databook for further information.  3.0 1.4 \n2.1 Unit: mm\n1.4 \nCMS06 \n2013-11-01 3 \n                                                           \n0.5 \n0.001 500 \n0.01 101 10 100 \n0.1 1 100 1000 Device mounted on a glass-epoxy board \nSoldering land: 6.0 mm × 6.0 mm \nDevice mounted on a ceramic board\nSoldering land: 2.0 mm × 2.0 mm Device mounted on a glass-epoxy board\nSoldering land: 2.1 mm × 1.4 mm \n \niF − vF \n \nPF (AV)  − IF (AV)  \n \nTℓ max − IF (AV)  \n \n C j − VR (typ.)\nInstantaneous forward voltage  v F  ( V )  \n \nAverage forward current  I F (AV)   (A) \n \nAverage forward current   I F (AV)   (A) \n \nReverse voltage  V R  ( V )  \n \n \n \n  \nAverage forward power dissipation \nPF (AV)   (W) \n \nInstantaneous forward current  i F  (A) \n \nJunction capacitance  C j  (pF) \nMaximum allowable lead temperature \n  Tℓ max  (°C) \n  \n   0.1 \n0.0 1 10 100 \n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8Tj = 125°C \n25°C75°C \n10\n11000\n10 100100f = 1 MHz \nTa = 25°C 0.0\n0.00.30.71.0\n0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 2.8 3.20.10.20.40.50.60.80.9\nα = 120°\nα = 60°α = 180° DC \n360° 0° α Rectangular \nwaveform \nConduction angle: α\n140 \n0 \n0.0 40 100 \n0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 2.8 3.220 60 80 120 \nα = 120° α = 180° \nα = 60° DC \n360° 0° α Rectangular \nwaveform \nConduction angle: α\nVR = 15 V IF (AV)\nTime  t  (s)  \n \nrth (j-a)  − t \n \nTransient thermal impedance  r th (j-a)   ( ° C / W )  \nCMS06 \n2013-11-01 4 \n                                                         \n04 0 1400.010.11101001000\n20 80 60 100 120 VR = 15 V VR = 30 V \nVR = 20 V \nVR = 10 V \nVR = 5 V VR = 3 V Pulse test\n1 10 100Ta = 25°C \nf = 50 Hz \n0 10 20 30 50 \n40 \n \n P R (AV)  − VR (typ.)\nNumber of cycles \n \nJunction temperature  T j  (°C) \n \nReverse voltage  V R  ( V )  \n \n \n \n  \n \nReverse current  I R  ( m A )  \n \nPeak surge forward current  I FSM  (A) \nAverage reverse power dissipation  \nPR (AV)   (W) \n  \n0 10 300.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 \n20 60° 120°180° 240° 300° DC 360° 0° \nVR Rectangular \nwaveform \nConduction angle: α \nTj = 125°C \n \n I R − Tj (typ.)\n \nSurge forward current (non-repetitive) \nCMS06 \n2013-11-01 5RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCT USE \n• Toshiba Corporation, and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collect ively "TOSHIBA"), reserve the right to make changes to the in formation \nin this document, and related hardware, software and systems (collectively "Product") without notice. \n• This document and any information herein may not be reproduc ed without prior written permission from TOSHIBA.
