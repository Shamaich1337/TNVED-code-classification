#### Description of the Component:
The BAV199 is a low-leakage double diode designed for medium-speed switching applications. It is constructed using epitaxial technology and is housed in a compact SOT23 surface-mounted plastic package. The diodes are connected in series, making it suitable for applications requiring low leakage current and efficient switching performance.

#### Typical Applications:
The BAV199 is primarily used in low-leakage current applications within surface-mounted circuits. Typical applications include:
- Signal processing circuits
- Power management systems
- Protection circuits (e.g., clamping and rectification)
- General-purpose switching applications in consumer electronics and industrial devices.

This component is particularly beneficial in scenarios where minimal leakage current is critical, such as battery-operated devices and sensitive analog circuits.
