GRAM   \n  \n \nFigure 4.  Functional Block Diagram  \n \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON \nSynchronous DC-DC Step -Down PowerSoC  \nThe EN6347 QI is a synchronous, programmable power supply with integrated power MOSFET switches and \nintegrated inductor. The nominal input voltage range is 2.5V to 6.6V. The output voltage is programmed using \nan external resistor divider network. The control loop is vo ltage -mode with a type III compensation network. \nMuch of the compensation circuitry is internal to the device. However, a phase lead capacitor is required along \nwith the output voltage feedback resistor divider to complete the type III compensation network . The device \nuses a low -noise PWM topology and also integrates a unique light -load mode (LLM) to improve efficiency at \nlight output load currents.  LLM can be disabled with a logic pin. Up to 4A of continuous output current can be drawn from this converter. The 3 MHz switching frequency allows the use of small size input / output \ncapacitors, and enables wide loop bandwidth within a small foot print.  \n Soft StartPower \nGood \nLogic\nRegulated \nVoltageVoltage \nReferenceCompensation \nNetworkThermal LimitUVLO\nCurrent Limit\nMode \nLogicP-Drive\nN-Drive\nPLL/Sawtooth \nGeneratorLLM/SYNC\nENABLE\nSS\nAGNDPOK\nAVINVFBPGNDVOUTNC(SW)PVIN RLLM\nError \nAmpPWM \nComp\n(+)(-)(-)\n(+)\n05991                                                                                                                  May 15, 2019                                                                                                                Rev L\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6347QI  \nPage 15   Protection Features:  \nThe power supply has the following protection features:  \n• Over -current protection (to protect the IC from excessive load current)  \n• Thermal shutdown with hysteresis.  \n• Under -voltage lockout circuit to keep the converter output off while the input voltage is less than 2.3V.  \nAdditional Features:  \n• The switching frequency can be phase -locked to an e xternal clock to eliminate or move beat frequency \ntones out of band.  \n• Soft -start circuit allowing controlled startup when the converter is initially powered up. The soft start time \nis programmable with an appropriate choice of soft start capacitor.  \n• Power good circuit indicating the output voltage is greater than 90% of programmed value as long as \nfeedback loop is closed.  \n• To maintain high efficiency at low output current, the device incorporates automatic light load mode \noperation.  \nPrecision Enable Operation  \nThe ENABLE pin provides a means to enable normal operation or to shut down the device. When the ENABLE \npin is asserted (high) the device will undergo a normal soft- start. A logic low on this pin will power the device \ndown in a controlled manner. From the moment ENABLE goes low, there is a fixed lock out time before the output will respond to the ENABLE pin re -asserted (high) . This lock out is activated for even very short logic \nlow pulses on the ENABLE pin. The ENABLE signal must be pulled high at a slew r ate faster than 1V/5µs in \norder to meet startup time specifications; otherwise, the device may experience a delay of 4.2ms (lock -out \ntime) before startup occurs. See the Electrical Characteristics Table for technical specifications for this pin.  See \nthe Electrical Characteristics Table  for technical specifications for the ENABLE  pin. \nLLM/SYNC Pin  \nThis is a dual function pin providing LLM Enable and External Clock Synchronization.  At static Logic HIGH, \ndevice will allow automatic engagement of light load mode.  At static logic LOW, the device is forced into PWM \nonly.  A clocked input to this pin will synchronize the internal switching frequency – LLM mode is not available \nif this input is clocked.  If this pin is left floating, it will pull to a static logic high, enabling LLM.  \nFrequency Synchronization  \nThe switching frequency of the DC -DC converter can be phase -locked to an external clock source to move \nunwanted beat frequencies out of band. To avail this feature, the clock source should be connected to the \nLLM/SYNC pin. An activity detector recognizes the presence of an external clock signal and automatically \nphase -locks the internal oscillator to this external clock.  Phase -lock will occur as long as the clock frequency \nis in the range specified in the Electrical Characteristics Table. For proper operation of the synchronization circuit, the high- level amplitude of the SYNC signal should not be above 2.5V. Please note LLM is not available \nwhen synchronizing to an external frequency.  \n05991                                                                                                                  May 15, 2019                                                                                                                Rev L\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6347QI  \nPage 16   Spread Spectrum Mode  \nThe external clock frequency may be swept between the limits specified in the Electrical Charact eristics Table \nat repetition rates of up to 10 kHz in order to reduce EMI frequency components.  \nSoft -Start Operation  \nDuring Soft -start, the output voltage is ramped up gradually upon start -up. The output rise time is controlled \nby the choice of soft -start capacitor, which is placed between the SS pin (30) and the AGND pin (32).   \nRise Time:  T R ≈ (CSS* 80kΩ) ± 25%  \nDuring  start- up of the converter, the reference voltage to the error amplifier is linearly increased to its final \nlevel by an internal current source of approximately 10 μA. Typical soft -start rise time is ~ 3.8ms with SS \ncapacitor value of 47nF. The rise time is measured from when V IN > V UVLOR  and ENABLE pin voltage crosses its \nlogic high threshold to when V OUT reaches its programmed value. Please note LLM function is disabled during \nthe soft -start ramp -up time.  \nPOK Operation  \nThe POK signal is an open drain signal  (requires a pull up resistor to V IN or similar voltage) from the converter \nindicating the output voltage is within the specified range. The POK signal will be logic high (V IN) when the \noutput voltage is above 90% of programmed V OUT. If the output voltage goes below this threshold, the POK \nsignal will be logic low.  \nLight Load Mode (LLM) Operation  \nThe EN6347 QI uses a proprietary light load mode to provide high efficiency at low output currents.  When the \nLLM/SYNC pin is high, the device is in automatic LLM “Detection” mode.  When the LLM/SYNC pin is low, the \ndevice is forced into PWM mode. In automatic LLM “Detection” mode  (LLM connected to AVIN with 50kΩ) , \nwhen a light load condition is detected, the device will:  \n(1) Step V OUT up by approximately 1.0% above the nominal operating output voltage setting, V NOM and as low \nas -0.5% below V NOM, and then  \n(2) Shut down unnecessary circuitry, and then  \n(3) Monitor V OUT.   \nWhen V OUT falls below V NOM, the device will repeat (1), (2), and (3). The voltage step up, or pre -positioning,  \nimproves transient droop when a load transient causes a transition from LLM mode to PWM mode.  If a load transient occurs, causing V\nOUT to fall below the threshold V MIN, the device will exit LLM operation and begin \nnormal PWM operation. Figure 5 demonstrates V OUT behavior during transition into and out of LLM operation.  \nMany multi -mode DC -DC converters suffer from a condition that occurs when the load current increases only \nslowly so that there is no load transient driving V OUT below the V MIN thre shold.  In this condition, the device \nwould never exit LLM operation.  This could adversely affect efficiency and cause unwanted ripple. To prevent \nthis from occurring, the EN6347 QI periodically exits LLM mode into PWM mode and measures the load current.  \nIf the load current is above the LLM threshold current, the device will remain in PWM mode.  If the load current is below the LLM threshold, the device will re -enter LLM operation.  There may be a small overshoot or \nundershoot in V\nOUT when the device exits  and re -enters LLM.  \n \n05991                                                                                                                  May 15, 2019                                                                                                                Rev L\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6347QI  \nPage 17    \nFigure 5. VOUT behavior in LLM operation  \nThe load current at which the device will enter LLM mode is a function of input and output voltage, inductance \nvariation and the RLLM pin resistor.

Typical LLM to PWM Current vs. RLLM  \nTo ensure normal LLM operation, LLM mode should be enabled and disabled with specific sequencing. For \napplications with explicit LLM pin control, enable LLM after V IN ramp up is complete. For applications with only \nENABLE controlled, tie LLM to ENABLE. Enable the device after VIN ramps up into regulation and disable the \ndevice before VIN ramps.  For designs with ENABLE and LLM tied to V IN, make sure the device soft -start time \nis longer than the V IN ramp -up time. LLM will start operating after the soft -start time is completed.  \nNOTE:  For proper LLM operation the EN6347 QI requires a minimum difference between V IN and V OUT, and a \nminimum LLM load requirement as specified in  the Electrical Characteristics Table .

When the \nsensed current exceeds the over cu rrent trip point, both power FETs are turned off for the remainder of the \nswitching cycle. If the over -current condition is removed, the over -current protection circuit will enable normal \nPWM operation. If the over -current condition persists, the soft start capacitor will gradually discharge causing \nthe output voltage to fall. When the OCP fault is removed, the output voltage will ramp back up to the desired voltage. This circuit is designed to provide high noise immunity.  \nThermal Protection  \nThermal shutdown circuit will disable device operation when the Junction temperature exceeds the thermal shutdown temperature. After a thermal shutdown event, when the junction temperature drops to a safe operating level , the converter will re -start with a normal soft -start. The specific thermal shutdown junction \ntemperature and hysteresis can be found in the Thermal Characteristics Table . \nInput Under- Voltage Lock- Out (UVLO)  \nInternal circuits ensure that the converter will not start switching until the input voltage is above the specified \nminimum voltage. Hysteresis and input de -glitch circuits ensure high noise immunity and prevent false UVLO \ntriggers.  \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n05991                                                                                                                  May 15, 2019                                                                                                                Rev L\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6347QI  \nPage 19   APPLICATION INFORMATION  \nOutput Voltage Setting  \nThe EN6347 QI uses a Type III voltage mode control compensation network. As noted earlier, a piece of the \ncompensation network is the phase lead capacitor C A equal 10pF in Figure 7 .

Additional output \ncapacitors may be used in parallel near the load (>4mΩ away) to improve transient response as well as lower \noutput ripple. In some cases modifications to the compensation or output filter capacitance may be required \nto optimize device per formance such as transient response, ripple, or hold -up time. The EN63 47QI provides \nthe capability to modify the control loop response to allow for customization for such applications. Note that \nin Type III Voltage Mode Control, the double pole of the output filter is around  1/2π�LO∙Cout, where Cout is the \nequivalent capacitance of all the output capacitors including the minimum required output capacitors that \nAltera recommended and the extra bulk capacitors customers added based on their design requirement.  While \nthe compensation network was designed based on the capacitors that Altera recommended, increasing the \noutput capacitance will shift the double pole to the direction of lower frequency, which will lower the loop bandwidth and phase margin. In most cases, this will not cause the instability due to adequate phase margin \nalready in the design. In order to maintain a higher bandwidth as well as adequate phase margin, a slight \nmodification of the external compensation is necessary. This can be easily implemented by increasing the leading capacitor value, Ca. In addition the ESR of the output capacitors also helps since the ESR and output capacitance forms a zero which also helps to boost the phase . \nTable 4.

The Enpirion PowerSoC helps alleviate some of those concerns.  \nThe Enpirion EN 6347QI  DC-DC converter is packaged in a 4x7x 1.85 mm 38 -pin QFN package. The QFN \npackage is constructed with copper lead frames that have exposed thermal pads. The exposed thermal pad \non the p ackage should be soldered directly on to a copper ground pad on the printed circuit board (PCB) to \nact as a heat sink. The recommended maximum junction temperature for continuous operation is 125°C. \nContinuous operation above 125°C may reduce long -term rel iability. The device has a thermal overload \nprotection circuit designed to turn off the device at an approximate junction temperature value of 16 0°C.  \nThe following example and calculations illustrate the thermal performance of the EN 6347QI . \nExample:  \nVIN = 5V \nVOUT = 3.3V  \nIOUT = 4A  \nFirst calculate the output power.  \nPOUT = 3.3V x 4A = 13.2 W \nNext, determine the input power based on the efficiency (η) shown in Figure 8.  \n \nFigure  8.

Alternate ENABLE configurations and other small signal pins need to be connected and routed \naccording to specific customer application. Please see the Gerber files on the Altera  website \nhttp://www.intel.com/enpirion  for exact dimensions and other layers.  Please refer to this Figure while reading \nthe layout rec ommendations in this section.  \n \nFigure 10. Top PCB Layer Critical Components and Copper for Minimum Footprint  (Top View)  \nRecommendation 1:  Input and output filter capacitors should be placed on the same side of the PCB, and as \nclose to the EN6347QI package as possible. They should be connected to the device with very short and wide traces. Do not use thermal reliefs or spokes when connecting  the capacitor pads to the respective nodes. The \n+V and GND traces between the capacitors and the EN6347QI should be as close to each other as possible so \nthat the gap between the two nodes is minimized, even under the capacitors.  \nRecommendation 2: Three P GND pins are dedicated to the input circuit, and three to the output circuit. The \nslit in Figure 10 separating the input and output GND circuits helps minimize noise coupling between the \nconverter input and output switching loops.  \nRecommendation 3: The sys tem ground plane should be the first layer immediately below the surface layer. \nThis ground plane should be continuous and un -interrupted below the converter and the input/output \ncapacitors. Please see the Gerber files on the Altera website http://www.intel.com/enpirion . \nRecommendation 4 : The large thermal pad underneath the component must be connected to the system \nground plane through as many vias as possible.  The dri ll diameter of the vias should be 0.33mm , and the vias \nmust have at least 1 oz. copper plating on the inside wall, making the finished hole size around 0.20 -0.26mm . \nDo not use thermal reliefs or spokes to connect the vias to the ground plane. This connecti on provides the \npath for heat dissipation from the converter.  \n05991                                                                                                                  May 15, 2019                                                                                                                Rev L\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6347QI  \nPage 28   Recommendation 5 : Multiple small vias (the same size as the thermal vias discussed in recommendation 4 \nshould be used to connect ground terminal of the input capacitor and output capacitors to the system ground \nplane. It is preferred to put these vias under the capacitors along the edge of the GND copper closest to the \n+V copper. Please see Figure 10. These vias connect the input/output filter capacitors to the GND plane, and \nhelp reduce parasitic inductances in the input and output current loops. If the vias cannot be placed under C IN \nand C OUT, then put them just outside the capacitors along the GND slit separating the two components. Do not \nuse thermal reliefs or spokes to connect these vias to  the ground plane.  \nRecommendation 6 : AVIN is the power supply for the internal small -signal control circuits. It should be \nconnected to the input voltage at a quiet point. In Figure 10 this connection is made at the input capacitor close to the V\nIN connect ion.  \nRecommendation 7 : The layer 1 metal under the device must not be more than shown in Figure 10. See the \nsection regarding exposed metal on bottom of package. As with any switch -mode DC -DC converter, try not to \nrun sensitive signal or control lines underneath the converter package on other layers.  \nRecommendation 8:  The V OUT sense point should be just after the last output filter capacitor. Keep the sense \ntrace as short as  possible in order to avoid noise coupling into the control loop.  \nRecommendation 9 : Keep R A, CA, and R B close to the VFB pin (see Figures 7). The VFB pin is a high -impedance, \nsensitive node. Keep the trace to this pin as short as possible. Whenever possible, connect R B directly to the \nAGND pin instead of going through the GND plane.  \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n05991                                                                                                                  May 15, 2019                                                                                                                Rev L\nDatas heet |  Intel®  Enpirion ® Power Solutions: EN6347QI  \nPage 29   DESIGN CONSIDERATION S FOR LEAD -FRAME BAS ED MODULES  \nExposed Metal on Bottom of Package  \nLead -frames offer many advantages in thermal performance, in reduced electrical lead resistance, and in \noverall foot print. However, they do require some special considerations.  \nIn the assembly process lead frame construction requires that, for mechanical support, some of the lead -frame \ncantilevers be exposed at the point where wire -bond or internal passives are attached. This results in several \nsmall pads being exposed on the bottom of the package, as shown in Figure 11.  \nOnly the thermal pad and the perimeter pads are to be mechanically or electrically connected to the PC board. \nThe PCB top layer under the EN6347QI should be clear of any metal (copper pours, traces, or vias) except for \nthe thermal pad. The “shaded -out” area in Figure 11 represents the area that should be clear of any metal on \nthe top layer of the PCB. Any layer 1 metal under the shaded -out area runs the risk of undesirable shorted \nconnections even if it is covered by soldermask.  \nThe s older stencil aperture should be smaller than the PCB ground pad.
