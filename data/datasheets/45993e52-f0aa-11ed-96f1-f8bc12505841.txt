Recommend placing input decoupling capacitance directly between the V\nIN pins and the GND pins. The V IN paths \ncan be all combined from one power source, or powered from independent power sources. The V\nIN paths can \noperate down to 2.375V when the CNTL_PWR is biased separately from a supply in the range of 4.7V to 16V . See the Applications Information section.\nSW1 (F11), SW2 (F7), SW3 (F3): The internal switch \nnode for each of the regulator channels for monitoring the switching waveform. An R-C snubber circuit can be placed on these pins to ground to eliminate switch node ringing noise.CNTL_PWR  (J6): Input Supply to an Internal Bias LDO to Power the Internal Controller and MOSFET Drivers. This pin is connected to an input supply voltage range of 4.7V to 16V . If the voltage at CNTL_PWR is ≤5.5V , the INTV\nCC \npin should be tied to CNTL_PWR for optimum efficiency. If the voltage at CNTL_PWR is >5.5V , leave INTV\nCC floating \nwith the recommended decoupling capacitor . When using multiple input supplies, choose the lowest input supply between 4.7V to 16V to supply the CNTL_PWR pin. This will lower the internal power loss and improve efficiency.   \nINTV\nCC (J8): Output of the Internal Bias LDO for Powering \nInternal Control Circuitry. Connect a 4.7µF ceramic capaci -\ntor to ground for decoupling. If the voltage at CNTL_PWR \nis ≤5.5V , tie the INT\nVCC pin to CNTL_PWR for optimum \nefficiency. If the voltage at CNTL_PWR is >5.5V , leave INTV\nCC floating. See the Applications Information section.\nSGND (K6-K7, L6-L7): Signal Ground Connections. The signal ground connection in the module is separated from normal power ground (GND) by an internal 2.2Ω resistor . This allows the designer to connect the signal ground pin close to GND near the external output capacitors on the regulator channel’s outputs. The entire internal small-signal feedback circuitry is referenced to SGND, thus allowing for better output regulation. See the recommended layout in the Applications Information section.\nEXTV\nCC (L3): External Bias Power Input. The internal bias \nLDO is bypassed whenever the voltage at EXTV CC is above \n4.7V . Never exceed 6V at this pin and ensure CNTL_PWR > \nEXTV CC at all times to avoid reverse polarity on the internal \nbias LDO. Connect a 1µF capacitor to ground when used otherwise leave floating. When generating a 5V output on channel 3, connect the 5V output to this pin to improve efficiency. PACKAGE ROW AND COLUMN LABELING MAY VARY \nAMONG µModule PRODUCTS.

This pin is driven with a DC voltage to set the operating frequency. Generally the pin is just connected to INTV\nCC to \nset the typical 750kHz operating frequency. Applying a DC voltage of 1.4V to this pin will set the frequency to 600kHz and 1.6V will set it to 700kHz. When an external clock is used, then the FREQ/PLLLPF pin must not be connected to any DC voltage. The pin must be floating and will have the proper internal compensation for the internal loop filter . For V\nOUT1,2,3  ≤ 1.5V use 600kHz, and for V OUT1,2,3  \n≥ 1.5V use ≥700kHz. These frequecny settings optimize efficiency and eliminate minimum on-time issues for less than 1V output. See the Applications Information section.\nMODE/PLLIN (L9): Force Continuous Mode, Burst Mode, \nor Pulse-Skipping Mode Selection Pin and External Syn -\nchronization Input to Phase Detector Pin. Connect this pin to SGND to force all channels into the continuous mode \nof operation. Connect to INT\nVCC to enable pulse-skipping \nmode of operation. Leaving the pin floating will enable Burst Mode operation. A clock on the pin will force the controller into continuous mode of operation and synchronize the internal oscillator .\nRUN1, RUN2, RUN3 (L10, L11, K11): Run Control Inputs. A \nvoltage above 1.3V on any RUN pin turns on that particular channel. However , forcing any of these RUN pins below 1.2V causes that channel to shut down. Each of the RUN pins has an internal 10k resistor to ground. This resistor can be used with an external pull-up resistor to the input voltage to set a UVLO for that channel, or simply to turn on the channel. The RUN pins have a maximum voltage of 6V .

Internal soft-start currents of 1.5μA are charging the soft-start capacitors.

Simplified L TM4633 Block Diagram\nLTM463310\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633opera Tion\nPower Module Description\nThe L TM4633 µModule regulator is a high performance \ntriple output nonisolated switching mode DC/DC power supply. It can provide 10A per output with a few exter -\nnal input and output capacitors. This module provides precisely regulated output voltages programmable via external resistors from 0.8V DC to 1.8V DC (V\nOUT1 and \nVOUT2), and 0.8V DC to 5.5V DC (V OUT3) over a 2.375V \nto 16V input range with control bias on the CNTL_PWR pin, or 4.7V to 16V with control bias tied to V\nIN. When \napplying control bias in the range from 4.7V to 5.5V , then connect the bias to CNTL_PWR and INVT\nCC, otherwise  \nif >5.5V only bias the CNTL_PWR pin. The typical applica -\ntion schematic is shown in Figure 16.\nThe L TM4633 has three integrated constant-frequency \ncurrent mode regulators, power MOSFET\ns, power induc-\ntors, and other supporting discrete components. The \ntypical switching frequency is 750kHz. For switching noise-sensitive applications, it can be externally syn -\nchronized from 600kHz to 750kHz. See the Applications Information section. \nWith current mode control and internal feedback loop \ncompensation, the \nL TM4633 module has sufficient stabil -\nity margins and good transient performance with a wide range of output capacitors, even with all ceramic output capacitors. \nCurrent mode control provides cycle-by-cycle fast current \nlimit in an over current condition. An internal over\nvolt-\nage monitor protects the output voltages in the event of an over voltage >7.5%. The top MOSFET is turned off \nand \nthe bottom MOSFET is turned on until the output overvoltage is cleared. There are two temperature moni -\ntors in the L TM4633. TEMP1 monitors the close relative temperature of channels 1 and 2, and TEMP2 monitors the close relative temperature of channels 2 and 3. The two diode \nconnected PNP transistors are grounded in the \nmodule and can be used as general purpose temperature monitors using a device that is designed to monitor the single-ended connection.\nPulling any of the RUN pins below 1.3V forces the cor -\nresponding regulator channel into a shutdown state. The \nTK/SS pins are used for programming the output voltage ramp and voltage tracking during start-up for each of the channels. See the Applications Information section.\nThe LTM4633 is internally compensated to be stable over all\n \noperating conditions. Table 5 provides a guideline for input \nand output capacitances for several operating conditions. The L TpowerCAD™ software tool is provided for transient and stability analysis. The V\nFB pin is used to program the \noutput voltage with a single external resistor to ground.\nEach of the channels, operate with a 120° phase shift for \nmultiphase operation. V OUT1 and V OUT2 can be combined \nto provide a single 20A output. The two channels will not be operating 180° phase shift, but 120° phase when combined for a 20A design. So the input RMS current will be higher than a 180° phase shifted design. See the Applications Information section.\nHigh efficiency at light loads can be accomplished with \nselectable Burst Mode operation using the MODE/PLLIN pin. These light load features will accommodate battery operation. Efficiency graphs are provided for light load op -\neration in the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nLTM463311\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633applica Tions inForMaTion\nThe typical L TM4633 application circuit is shown in Fig -\nure\xa016. External component selection is primarily deter-\nmined by the maximum load current and output voltage. Refer to T able 5 for specific external capacitor requirements\n \nfor particular applications.\nVIN to V OUT Step-Down Ratios\nThere are restrictions in the V IN to V OUT step-down ratio \nthat can be achieved for a given input voltage. The V IN to \nVOUT minimum dropout is a function of load current and \nat very low input voltage and high duty cycle applications \noutput power may be limited as the internal top power MOSFET is not rated for 10A operation at higher ambient temperatures. At very low duty cycles the minimum 90ns on-time must be maintained. See the Frequency Adjust -\nment section and temperature derating curves.\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe P\nWM controller has an internal 0.8V ±1% reference \nvoltage. As shown in the Block Diagram, a 60.4k preci -\nsion internal feedback resistor connects the V OUT and V FB \npins together . \nThe output voltage will default to 0.8V with no feedback \nresistor . Adding a resistor R FB from V FB to ground pro-\ngrams the output voltage:\n  VOUT =0.8V •60.4k +RFB\nRFB\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7, RFB =48.32k\nVOUT– 0.8V\nTable 1.

Additional input capacitors are needed for the RMS input ripple current rating. The I\nCIN(RMS)  \nequation which follows can be used to calculate the input capacitor requirement for each channel. Typically 22µF X7R ceramics are a good choice with RMS ripple current ratings of ~2A each. A 47µF to 100µF surface mount alu -\nminum electrolytic capacitor can be used for more input bulk capacitance. This bulk input capacitor is only needed \nif the input sour\nce impedance is compromised by long \ninductive leads, traces or not enough source capacitance. If low impedance power planes are used, then this bulk capacitor is not needed.\nFor a buck converter , the switching duty cycle can be \nestimated as:\n  D=VOUT\nVIN\nWithout considering the inductor ripple current, for each output, the RMS current of the input capacitor can be estimated as:\n  ICIN(RMS) =IOUT(MAX)\nη%• D• 1–D ( )\n (1)\nIn the previous equation, \nη% is the estimated efficiency \nof the power module in decimal form (0.nn) for a given V\nOUT-to-V IN ratio. \nThe selection of C IN is simplified by the 3-phase architec-\nture and its impact on the worst-case RMS current draw occurs when only \none channel is operating. This is true \nwhen the three channels are powered from a common V\nIN. The channel with the highest duty cycle D peaking at \n0.5 and maximum load current needs to be used in the \nLTM463312\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633applica Tions inForMaTion\nabove formula. This will give the maximum RMS capacitor \ncurrent requirement. Increasing the output current drawn from the other channels will actually decrease the input RMS ripple current from its maximum value. The out-of-phase technique typically reduces the input capacitor’s RMS ripple current by a factor of 50% when compared to a single phase power supply solution. If the three channels are powered from independent input sources, then each of the input RMS current ratings will need to be calculated specific to that channel.\nOutput Capacitors\nThe L TM4633 is designed for low output voltage ripple \nnoise. The bulk output capacitors defined as C\nOUT are \nchosen with low enough effective series resistance (ESR) to meet the output voltage ripple and transient require -\nments. C\nOUT can be a low ESR tantalum capacitor , low ESR \nPolymer capacitor or ceramic capacitor . The typical output capacitance range is from 200µF to 470µF . Additional output filtering may be required by the system designer if further reduction of output ripple or dynamic transient spikes is required. Table 5 shows a matrix of different output voltages and output capacitors to minimize the voltage droop and overshoot during a 5A/µs transient. The table optimizes total equivalent ESR and total bulk capacitance to optimize the transient performance. Stability criteria are considered in the Table 5 matrix, and L TpowerCAD is available for free to conduct stability analysis. L TpowerCAD can calculate the output ripple reduction as the number of implemented phases increases by N times.\nBurst Mode Operation\nThe L TM4633 is capable of Burst Mode operation in \nwhich the power MOSFETs operate intermittently based on load demand, thus saving quiescent current. For ap -\nplications where maximizing the efficiency at very light loads is a high priority, Burst Mode operation should be applied. T\no enable Burst Mode operation, simply float \nthe MODE/PLLIN pin. During Burst Mode operation, the peak current of the inductor is set to approximately 30% of the maximum peak current value in normal operation even though the voltage at the COMP pin indicates a lower value. The voltage at the COMP pin drops when the inductor’s average current is greater than the load requirement. As the COMP voltage drops below 0.5V , the burst comparator trips, causing the internal sleep line to go high and turn off both power MOSFETs.\nIn sleep mode, the internal circuitry is partially turned off, reducing the quiescent current. The load current is now being supplied from the output capacitors. When the output voltage drops, causing COMP to rise, the internal sleep line goes low, and the L TM4633 resumes normal operation. The next oscillator cycle will turn on the top power MOSFET and the switching cycle repeats.\nPulse-Skipping Mode Operation\nI\nn applications where low output ripple and high efficiency \nat intermediate currents are desired, pulse-skipping \nmode should be used. Pulse-skipping operation allows the L TM4633 to skip cycles at low output loads, thus increasing efficiency by reducing switching loss. Tying the MODE/PLLIN pin to INTV\nCC enables pulse-skipping \noperation. With pulse-skipping mode at light load, the internal current comparator may remain tripped for several cycles, thus skipping operation cycles. This mode has lower ripple than Burst Mode operation and maintains a higher frequency operation than Burst Mode operation.\nForced Continuous Operation\nIn applications where fixed frequency operation is more \ncritical than low current efficiency, and where the lowest output ripple is desired, forced continuous operation should be used. Forced continuous operation can be enabled by tying the \nMODE/PLLIN  pin to ground. In this \nmode, inductor current is allowed to reverse during low output loads, the COMP voltage is in control of the current comparator threshold throughout, and the top MOSFET always turns on with each oscillator pulse. During start-up, forced continuous mode is disabled and inductor current is prevented from reversing until the L TM4633 output voltage is in regulation.\nLTM463313\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633applica Tions inForMaTion\nPLL, Frequency Synchronization\nThe L TM4633 device operates up to 750kHz. It can also be \nsynchronized with an input clock that has a high level above 2V and a low level below 0.8V at the MODE/PLLIN pin. The FREQ/PLLLPF pin must be floating when synchronized to an incoming clock. Once the L TM4633 is synchronized to an external clock frequency, it will always be running in forced continuous operation. The synchronizing range is from 600kHz to 750kHz. For V\nOUT1,2,3  ≤ 1.5V use 600kHz, \nand for V OUT1,2,3  ≥ 1.5V use ≥700kHz. These frequencies \noptimize efficiency, eliminate minimum on-time issues for less than 1V output, and control the inductor ripple currents over the input and output voltage ranges.\nA DC voltage should be applied to the FREQ/PLLLPF pin \nto set the operating frequency when clock synchronization is not used. A voltage divider from the INTV\nCC pin (5V) to \nground can be used to set the frequency to 600kHz (set to 1.4V), 700kHz (set to 1.6V), or tie the FREQ/PLLLPF pin to the INTV\nCC pin for 750kHz. The top resistor in the \nvoltage divider should be 50k, and the bottom resistor should be 19.6k for 600kHz (set to 1.4V), or 23.7k for 700kHz (set to 1.6V). In most cases the FREQ/PLLLPF pin can be tied to the INTV\nCC pin for 750kHz operation \nas long as the minimum on-time is not below 100ns. See Figure 18 for an example.\nParallel Channel Operation\nFor outputs that demand more than 10A of load current, \nthe L TM4633 device can parallel V\nOUT1 and V OUT2 to sup -\nply 20A of load current. The two channels will operate at 120° of phase shift. The input RMS ripple current can be calculated using Equation 1. For example, 12V to 1.2V at 20A equates to duty cycle D = 0.1. \n  ICIN(RMS) =20A\n0.84• 0.1• 1– 0.1 ( )\nICIN(RMS)  = 7.14A RMS, use 4 × 22µF 16V X5R or X7R \nceramic capacitors rated at 2A RMS each.The L TM4633 regulators are inherently current mode controlled devices, so the paralleling of V\nOUT1 and V OUT2 \nchannels will have good current sharing. This will balance the thermals in the design. Tie the COMP , V\nFB, TK/SS \nand RUN pins together for these two channels to share the current evenly. Figure 18 shows a schematic of the parallel design. \nMinimum On-Time\nMinimum on-time, t\nON, is the smallest time duration that \nany of the three regulator channels is capable of turning on \nthe top MOSFET . It is determined by internal timing delays, and the gate charge required to turn-on the top MOSFET . Low duty cycle applications may approach this minimum on-time limit and care should be taken to ensure that:\n  VOUT\nVIN•FREQ>tON(MIN)\nIf the duty cycle falls below what can be accommodated by the minimum on-time, the controller will begin to skip cycles. The output voltage will continue to be regulated, but the output ripple and inductor ripple current will increase. The minimum on-time can be increased by lowering the switching frequency. A good rule of thumb is to use 100ns for the minimum on-time.\nOutput Voltage T racking\nOutput voltage tracking can be programmed externally \nusing the TK/SS pins. The output can be tracked up and down with another regulator . The master regulator’s output is divided down with an external resistor divider that is the same as the slave regulator’s feedback divider to imple -\nment coincident tracking. The L TM4633 uses an accurate 60.4k resistor internally for the top feedback resistor for each channel. \nFigure 2 shows an example of coincident \ntracking for V OUT1 and V OUT2. VOUT1 is the master and \nVOUT2 is the slave:\n  VSLAVE =1+60.4k\nRTA\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7VTRACK\nLTM463314\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633applica Tions inForMaTion\nVTRACK  is the track ramp applied to the slave’s track pin. \nVTRACK  has a control range of 0V to 0.8V , or the internal \nreference voltage. When the master’s output is divided \ndown with the same resistor values used to set the slave’s output, then the slave will coincident track with the master until it reaches its final value. The master will continue to its final value from the slave’s regulation point. Voltage tracking is disabled when V\nTRACK  is more than 0.8V . R TA in \nFigure 2 will be equal to the R FB2 for coincident tracking. \nThe TK/SS pin of the master can be controlled by a capaci -\ntor placed on the master regulator TK/SS pin to ground. A 1.5µA current \nsource will charge the TK/SS pin up to the \nreference voltage and then proceed up to INTV CC. After the \n0.8V ramp, the TK/SS pin will no longer be in control, and the internal voltage reference will control output regula -\ntion from the feedback divider . Foldback current limit is disabled during this sequence of turn-on during tracking or soft-starting. The TK/SS pins are pulled low when the RUN pin is below 1.3V or INTV\nCC drops below 3.5V . The \ntotal soft-start time can be calculated as:\n  tSS =0.8V •CSS\n1.5µA\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nRegardless of the mode selected by the MODE/PLLIN pin, \nthe regulator channels will always start in pulse-skipping mode up to TK/SS = 0.64V . Between TK/SS = 0.64V and 0.74V , it will operate in forced continuous mode and revert to the selected mode once TK/SS > 0.74V . The output ripple is minimized during the 100mV forced continuous mode window ensuring a clean PGOOD signal. \nWhen the channel is configured to track another supply, \nthe feedback voltage of the other supply is duplicated by a resistor divider and applied to the TK/SS pin. Therefore, the voltage ramp rate on this pin is determined by the ramp rate of the other supply’s voltage.

To minimize this error , select the  \ntracking resistive divider value to be small enough to make \nthis error negligible. In order to track down another channel  \nor supply after the soft-start phase expires, the L\nTM4633 \nis forced into continuous mode of operation as soon as V\nFB is below the undervoltage threshold of 0.74V regard -\nless of the setting of the MODE/PLLIN pin. However , the LTM4633 should always be set in for\nce continuous mode \ntracking down when there is no load. After TK/SS drops below 0.1V , its channel will operate in discontinuous mode.\nThe master’s TK/SS pin slew rate is directly equal to the \nmaster’s output slew rate in Volts/Time. The equation:\n  RTB =MR\nSR\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7•60.4k\nwhere MR is the master’s output slew rate and SR is the \nslave’s output slew rate in Volts/Time. When coincident tracking is desired, then MR and SR are equal, thus R\nTB \nis equal the 60.4k. R TA is derived from equation:\n  RTA =0.8V\nVFB\n60.4k+VFB\nRFB–VTRACK\nRTB\nwhere V FB is the feedback voltage reference of the regula -\ntor , and V TRACK  is 0.8V . Since R TB is equal to the 60.4k top \nfeedback resistor of the slave regulator in equal slew rate or coincident tracking, then R\nTA is equal to R FB with V FB = \nVTRACK . Therefore R TB = 60.4k, and R TA = 60.4k in Figure 2.\nIn ratiometric tracking, a different slew rate maybe desired for the slave regulator . R\nTB can be solved for when SR is \nslower than MR. Make sure that the slave supply slew rate is chosen to be fast enough so that the slave output voltage will reach it final value before the master output.Power Good\nThe PGOOD12 pin is an open-drain pin that can be used \nto monitor valid output voltage regulation for V\nOUT1 and \nVOUT2, and PGOOD3 for monitoring V OUT3. These pins \nmonitor a ±7.5% window around the 0.8V feedback volt-age on either V\nFB1,2,3  from the output regulation point. A \nresistor can be pulled up to a particular supply voltage no greater than 6V maximum for monitoring. Any of the PGOOD pins are pulled low when the RUN pin of the cor -\nresponding channel is pulled low.\nOvercurrent and Over voltage Protection\nEach of the regulator channels senses the peak inductor \ncurrent on a cycle-by-cycle basis as current mode opera -\ntion. When current limit is reached the output voltage will begin to fall and the internal current limit threshold will begin fold back as \nthe output voltage falls below 50% of \nits value. Foldback current limit is disabled during start-up or track-up. Under a short-circuit condition at low duty cycle operation, each of the regulator channels will begin to skip cycles to limit the short-circuit current.\nOvervoltage protection is implemented by monitoring \neach one of the regulator’s V\nFB pins. When the V FB voltage \nexceeds ~7.5% above the 0.8V reference value, then an internal comparator monitor will turn off the top power switch, and turn on the bottom power switch to protect the load. If the top power switch faults as a short, then a fuse or circuit breaker would be recommended to protect the system. This is due to the top switch being shorted while the bottom switch is turning on to protect the output from over voltage. High currents will flow and could damage the bottom switch.\nLTM463316\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633applica Tions inForMaTion\nStability Compensation\nThe L TM4633 has already been internally compensated for \nall output voltages. Table 5 is provided for most applica -\ntion requirements with verified stability. L TpowerCAD is available for other control loop optimization.\nRun Enable\nThe RUN 1, 2, 3 pins have an enable threshold of 1.4V \nmaximum, typically 1.3V with 175mV of hysteresis. They control the \nturn-on of their respective channel. There is \na 10k resistor on each pin to ground. The RUN pins can be pulled up to V\nIN for 5V operation, or a resistor can be \nplaced on the pins and connected to V IN for higher than 5V \ninput. This resistor can be set along with the onboard 10k resistor such that an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) level can be programmed to shut down a particular regulator channel if V\nIN falls below a set value. Use the equation:\n  R=10k UVLO–1.3V ( )\n1.3V\nwhere R is the resistor from the RUN pin to V IN to set the \nUVLO trip point. For example, if the UVLO point is to be 6.25V while operating at 12V input: \n  R=10k 6.25V –1.3V ( )\n1.3V≈38.3k\nSee the Typical Application circuits in Figure 17. The RUN pins must not go above 6V maximum voltage. The RUN pins have to be pulled up to enable the regulators.\nSW Pins\nThe SW pins are generally used for testing purposes by \nmonitoring the pin of interest. The SW pins can also be used to dampen out switch node ringing caused by LC parasitics in the switched current path. Usually a series R-C combination is used called a snubber circuit. The resistor will dampen the resonance and the capacitor is chosen to only affect the high frequency ringing across the resistor . If the stray inductance or capacitance can be measured or approximated then a somewhat analytical technique can be used to select the snubber values. The inductance is usually easier to predict. It combines the PowerPath™ board inductance in combination with the MOSFET inter-connect inductance.\nFirst, the SW pin can be monitored using a wide band -\nwidth scope with a high frequency scope probe. The ring \nfrequency can be measured for its value. The impedance, Z, can be calculated:\n Z(L) = 2π • f • L\nwhere f is the resonant frequency of the ring, and L is the total parasitic inductance in the switch path. If a resistor is selected that is equal to Z, then the ringing should be dampened. The snubber capacitor value is then chosen so that its impedance is equal to the resistor at the ring frequency:\n  Z(C) =1\n2π• f •C\nThese values are a good place to start with. Modification to these components should be made to attenuate the ring -\ning without lowering the regulator’s conversion efficiency.\nINTV\nCC and EXTV CC\nThe L TM4633 has an onboard linear regulator fed by \nCNTL_PWR which delivers a roughly 5V output at INTV CC \nto power the internal controller and MOSFET drivers for all three regulator channels. CNTL_PWR requires a voltage between 4.7V to 16V . Apply a 4.7µF ceramic capacitor between INTV\nCC and ground for decoupling. If the volt -\nage supplied to CNTL_PWR is ≤ 5.5V , connect INTV CC to \nCNTL_PWR. Otherwise, INTV CC should be left floating. To \neliminate power loss in the onboard linear regulator and improve efficiency connect a supply from 4.7V to 6V at EXTV\nCC. Biasing EXTV CC will reduce the power loss in the \ninternal LDO by (VCNTL_PWR – 5V) • 70mA. If EXTV CC is \nused add a 1µF ceramic capacitor to ground at EXTV CC and \nLTM463317\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633applica Tions inForMaTion\nensure the voltage at CNTL_PWR  is always greater than \nthe voltage at EXTV CC at all times including during start-up \nand shutdown. Connecting V OUT3 to EXTV CC may present \na convenient way to meet the sequencing requirement if V\nOUT3 is a 5V output. Otherwise float EXTV CC if not used. \nThermal Considerations and Output Current Derating\nThe thermal resistances reported in the Pin Configura -\ntion section of the data sheet are consistent with those \nparameters defined by JESD 51-12 and are intended for use with finite element analysis (FEA) software modeling tools that \nleverage the outcome of thermal modeling, \nsimulation, and correlation to hardware evaluation per-formed on a µModule package mounted to a hardware test board defined by JESD 51-9 (“Test Boards for Area Array Surface Mount Package Thermal Measurements”). The motivation for providing these thermal coefficients is found in JESD 51-12 (“Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information”).\nMany designers in lieu or to compliment any FEA activities \nmay opt to use laboratory equipment and a test vehicle such as the demo board to anticipate the µModule regula -\ntor’s thermal performance in their application at various electrical and environmental operating conditions. Without  \nFEA software, the thermal resistances reported in the Pin Configuration section are in-and-of themselves not relevant\n \nto providing guidance of thermal performance; instead, the derating curves provided later in the data sheet can be used in a manner that yields insight and guidance pertaining to one’s application usage, and can be adapted to correlate thermal performance to one’s own application.\nThe Pin Configuration section provides values based on \nfour thermal coefficients explicitly defined in JESD 51-12; these coefficients are quoted or paraphrased:1.\n θJA: The thermal resistance from junction to ambient, is \nthe natural convection junction-to-ambient air thermal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed enclo -\nsure. This environment is sometimes referred to as “still air” although natural convection causes the air to move. This value is determined with the part mounted to \na JESD 51-9 defined test board, which does not reflect an actual application or viable operating condition.\n2.\n θJCbottom : The thermal resistance from the junction to \nthe bottom of the product case, is determined with all of the internal power dissipation flowing through the bottom of the package. In a typical µModule regulator , the bulk of the heat flows out the bottom of the pack -\nage, but there is always heat flow out into the ambient environment. As a result, this thermal resistance value may be useful for comparing packages but the test conditions don’t \ngenerally match the user’s application.\n3. θJCtop: The thermal resistance from junction to top of \nthe product case, is determined with nearly all of the component power dissipation flowing through the top of the package. As the electrical connections of the typical µModule regulator are on the bottom of the package, it is rare for an application to operate such that most of the heat flows from the junction to the top of the part. As in the case of θ\nJCbottom , this value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n4.\n θJB: The thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board, is the junction-to-board thermal resistance where almost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the µModule package and into the board, and is really the sum of the θ\nJCbottom  and the thermal resistance of \nthe bottom of the part through the solder joints and through a portion of the board. The board temperature is measured at a specified distance from the package, using a 2-sided, 2-layer board. This board is described in JESD 51-9.\nLTM463318\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633applica Tions inForMaTion\nA graphical representation of the aforementioned ther -\nmal resistances is given in Figure 3; blue resistances are \ncontained within the μModule regulator , whereas green \nresistances are external to the µModule package.\nAs \na practical matter , it should be clear to the reader that \nno individual or sub-group of the four thermal resistance \nparameters defined by JESD 51-12 or provided in the Pin Configuration section replicates or conveys normal operating conditions of a μModule regulator . For example, in normal board-mounted applications, never does 100% of the device’s total power loss (heat) thermally con -\nduct exclusively through the top or exclusively through  \nbottom of the µModule package—as the standard defines for θ\nJCtop and θ JCbottom , respectively. In practice, power \nloss is thermally dissipated in both directions away from the package—granted, in the absence of a heat sink and airflow, a majority of the heat flow is into the board.\nWithin the L TM4633, be aware there are multiple power \ndevices and components dissipating power , with a con-sequence that the thermal resistances relative to different junctions of components or die are not exactly linear with respect to total package power loss. To reconcile this complication without sacrificing modeling simplicity—but also, not ignoring practical realities—an approach has been taken using FEA software modeling along with laboratory testing in a controlled environment chamber to reasonably define and correlate the thermal resistance values supplied in this data sheet: (1) Initially, FEA software is used to accurately build the mechanical geometry of the L TM4633 and the specified PCB with all of the cor -\nrect material coefficients along with accurate power loss source definitions; (2) this model simulates a software-\ndefined JEDEC environment consistent with JSDE 51-12 to predict power loss heat \nflow and temperature readings \nat different interfaces that enable the calculation of the JEDEC-defined thermal resistance values; (3) the model and FEA software is used to evaluate the L TM4633 with heat sink and airflow; (4) having solved for and analyzed these thermal resistance values and simulated various operating conditions in the software model, a thorough laboratory evaluation replicates the simulated conditions with thermocouples within a controlled environment chamber while operating the device at the same power loss as that which was simulated. The outcome of this process and due diligence yields a set of derating curves provided in other sections of this data sheet. \nAfter these laboratory tests have been performed and cor -\nrelated to the L TM4633 model, then the θ\nJB and θ BA are \nsummed together to correlate quite well with the device \nmodel conditions of no airflow or heat sinking in a properly \n4633 F03µMODULE DEVICEJUNCTION-TO-CASE (TOP)\nRESISTANCE\nJUNCTION-TO-BOARD RESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-AMBIENT RESISTANCE COMPONENTS\nCASE (TOP)-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCE\nBOARD-TO-AMBIENT\nRESISTANCEJUNCTION-TO-CASE\n(BOTTOM) RESISTANCEJUNCTION AMBIENT\nCASE (BOTTOM)-TO-BOARD\nRESISTANCE\nFigure 3.

This θ JB + θBA value should accurately \nequal the θ JA value because approximately 100% of power \nloss flows from the junction through the board into ambi -\nent with no air-flow or top mounted heat sink.\nLTM4633 Thermal Considerations and Output Current \nDerating\nThe power loss cur\nves at 5V input, 8V input, and 12V \ninput are in Figures 7 to 9. These power loss curves can \nbe used in coordination with the load current derating curves in Figures 10 to 15 for calculating an approximate θ\nJA thermal resistance for the L TM4633 with various heat \nsinking and airflow conditions. The power loss curves are taken at room temperature, and are increased with a multiplicative factor of 1.4 at 125°C junction. This factor comes from the fact that the power loss of the regulator increases about 50% from 25°C to 150°C, thus a 50% spread over 125°C delta equates to ~0.4%/°C power loss increase. A 125°C maximum junction minus 25°C room temperature equates to a 100°C increase. This 100°C increase multiplied by 0.4%/°C equals a 40% power loss increase at the 125°C junction, thus the 1.4 multiplier . \nThe derating curves are plotted with the output current \nstarting at 30A and the ambient temperature at 40°C. The 30A come from each of the three channels operating at 10A each. This simplifies the loading for this thermal testing. The output voltages are 1.0V and 1.8V when all three channels are loaded together in parallel. Channel 1 and Channel 2 are designed to operate with outputs up to 1.8V . T wo additional derating curves are shown with Channel\xa01 and Channel 2 operating at 1.8V at 10A each for a total of 20A while Channel 3 is at 5V with 10A load current derated over ambient temperature. This is done to look at some of the different output power conditions to correlate thermal resistance numbers that can be used for derating the L TM4633 power module with different output power requirements. The power loss curve values at a particular output voltage and output current for each output are taken and multiplied by 1.4 for increased power loss at 125°C junction. Thermal models are derived from several temperature measurements in a controlled tem -\nperature chamber along with thermal modeling analysis. The junction temperatures are monitored while ambient temperature is increased with and without air flow\n. The \npower loss increase with ambient temperature change is factored into the derating curves. The junctions are maintained at 125°C maximum while lowering output current or power with increasing ambient temperature. The decreased output current will decrease the internal module loss as ambient temperature is increased. The monitored junction temperature of 125°C minus the ambi -\nent operating temperature specifies how much temperature rise can be allowed. For \nexample, in Figure 11, the 1V \nload current is derated to ~20A at ~85°C with no air and with heat sink. In Figure 9, the 12V to 1.0V power loss at 6.66A per channel is 1.4W . The total power loss would be 3 times 1.4W or 4.2W . The 4.2W is then multiplied by the 1.4 multiplier for 125°C junction. This 5.88W value is used with the total temperature rise of 125°C minus the 85°C ambient to calculate θ\nJA thermal resistance. If the \n85°C ambient temperature is subtracted from the 125°C junction temperature, then the difference of 40°C divided by 5.88W equals a 6.8°C/W θ\nJA thermal resistance. Table \n2 specifies a 6°C/W value which is very close. Tables 2 to 4 provide equivalent thermal resistances for 1.0V , 1.8V , and combination 1.8V and 5V outputs with and without air flow and heat sinking. The derived thermal resistances in Tables\xa02 and 4 for the various conditions can be multiplied by the calculated power loss as a function of the 125°C maximum junction temperature to determine if the tem -\nperature rise plus ambient is below the 125°C maximum junction temperature. Thermal or infrared imaging should be per formed to validate the calculated results. Room \ntemperature power loss can be derived from the power \nLTM463320\n4633f\nFor more information www.linear .com/L TM4633applica Tions inForMaTion\nloss curves in Figures 8 to 10 and adjusted with the 1.4 \nmultiplier . The printed circuit board is a 1.6mm thick four layer board with two ounce copper for the two outer layers and one ounce copper for the two inner layers. The PCB dimensions are 95mm x 76mm. The BGA heat sinks are listed below Table 4.\nTemperature Monitoring (TEMP1 and TEMP2)\nA diode connected PNP transistor is used for the TEMP \nmonitor function by monitoring its voltage over tempera -\nture. The temperature dependence of this diode can be understood in the equation: \n  D=nVTlnID\nIS\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nwhere V T is the thermal voltage (kT/q), and n, the ideality \nfactor is 1 for the two diode connected PNPs being used \nin the L TM4633. Since I D has an exponential temperature \ndependence that can be understood from the typical em -\npirical equation for I S:  \n  IS=IOexp–VGO\nVT\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nwhere I O is some process and geometry-dependent current \n(IO is typically around 20 orders of magnitude larger than \nIS at room temperature, so I O is much larger than typical \nvalues of I D), and V G0 is the band gap voltage of 1.2V \nextrapolated to absolute zero of –273°C Kelvin. Figure\xa04 \nshows a plot of the diode temperature characteristic of the diode connected PNP transistor biased with a 100ua current source. This plot would extend to the left back to 1.2V at –273°C Kelvin. This curve is stop at –55°C due to the test system limits.\nIf we take the I\nS equation and substitute into the V D equa-\ntion, then we get:\n  VD=VGO–kT\nq\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7ln10\nID\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7, VT=kT\nqThe expression shows that the junction voltage of the PNP \nconnected diode decreases linearly if I O were constant \nfrom a value V G0 of 1.2V at absolute zero to a decreasing \nvalue with increased temperature.Figure 4.

This equation is simplified for the first order derivation.\nSolving for T , T = –(V\nG0 – VD)/dV D provide the temperature.\n1st Example: Figure 4 for 27°C, or 300°C Kelvin the diode \nvoltage is 0.598V , thus, 300°C = –(1200mV – 598mV)/  \n–2.0 mV/°C)\n2nd Example: Figure 4 for 75°C, or 350°C Kelvin the diode \nvoltage is 0.50V , thus, 350°C = –(1200mV – 500mV)/  \n–2.0mV\n/°C)\nConverting the Kelvin scale to Celsius is simply taking the Kelvin temp and subtracting –273°C Kelvin from it.\nA typical forward voltage is measured and placed in the \nelectrical characteristics section of the data sheet, and Figure 4 is the plot of this for\nward voltage. Measure this \nforward voltage at 27°C to establish a reference point. Then use the above expression while measuring the forward voltage over temperature will provide a general temperature monitor .\nThe diode connected PNP transistor at the TEMP pins can \nbe used to monitor the internal temperature of the L TM4633. A general temperature monitor can be implemented by connecting a resistor between TEMP and V\nIN to set the \ncurrent to 100µA, and then monitoring the diode voltage drop with temperature. See Figure 19 for an example.\nSafety Considerations\nThe L TM4633 module does not provide galvanic isolation \nfrom V\nIN to any of the three V OUTs. There is no internal \nfuse. If required, a slow blow fuse with a rating higher than the maximum input current can be used to protect the unit in case of a catastrophic failure. An inline circuit breaker function can also be used instead of a fuse.\nThe fuse or circuit breaker should be selected to limit the \ncurrent to the regulator during overvoltage in case of an internal top MOSFET fault. If the internal top MOSFET fails, then turning it off will not resolve the overvoltage, thus the internal bottom MOSFET will turn on indefinitely trying to protect the load. Under this fault condition, the input voltage will source very large currents to ground through the failed internal top MOSFET and enabled internal bot -\ntom MOSFET . This can cause excessive heat and board damage depending on how much power the input voltage can deliver to this system. A fuse or circuit breaker can \nbe used as a secondar\ny fault protector in this situation.\nLayout Checklist/Example\nThe high integration of L TM4633 makes the PCB board \nlayout very simple and easy. However , to optimize its electri -\ncal and thermal performance, some layout considerations are still necessar y \n.\nUse large PCB copper areas for high current paths, in -\ncluding V IN, GND, V OUT1, VOUT2, and V OUT3. It helps to \nminimize the PCB conduction loss and thermal stress. Place high frequency ceramic input and output capacitors next to the V\nIN, GND and the V OUT pins to minimize high \nfrequency noise.\nPlace a dedicated power ground layer underneath the unit. \nTo minimize the via conduction loss and reduce module thermal stress, use multiple vias for interconnection be -\ntween top layer and other power layers.\nDo not put vias directly on the pads, unless they are capped \nor plated over . Use a separated SGND ground copper area \nfor components connected to signal pins. Connect the SGND to GND underneath the unit. Bring out test points on the signal pins for monitoring.
