This signal is a common bus between a ll power supplies in the system. \nWAKEUP_BUS# is asserted (pulled low) when there is a fault in any power supply OR the power \nsupplies output voltage falls below the Vfault thre shold.  Asserting the WAKEUP_BUS# signal \ncauses all power supplies in sleep state to power O N. \n \nWhenever there is not any Wakeup Redundancy active power supply driving a HIGH level on the \nWAKEUP_BUS#, all power supplies shall be ON/AWAKE n o matter what their defined Wakeup \nRedundancy setting (awake or sleep).  This guarante es that incorrect programming of the \nWakeup Redundancy setting of the power supply will never cause the power subsystem to \nshutdown or become over loaded.  The default state of the power subsystem is for all power \nsupplies to be ON/AWAKE.

ACK is done by pulling d own the SDA line. If there is a missing clock cycle , \nthe chip doing the ACK will hold down the SDA line indefinitely and hanging the I2C bus.  The \npower supply needs to prevent the above scenario fr om happening.  If the I2C bus SDA or SCL is \nstuck low for more than 25 ms, the power supply sho uld reset either its I2C communication module, or \nitself. \n \nThe power supply I2C microcontroller should not lat ch the system I2C bus by pulling SDA or SCL line \nlow for more than 25 ms. \n \n6.2 PMBus \n \nThe PMbus specification is based on the PMBus speci fication parts I and II, revision 1.1 and 1.2.   \nPMBus Power System Management Protocol Specificatio n Part I – General Requirements, Transport and \nElectrical Interface; Revision 1.2; Reference: http://pmbus.org/specs.html  \n \nPMBus Power System Management Protocol Specificatio n Part II – Command Language; Revision 1.2; \nReference: http://pmbus.org/specs.html  \n \nSystem Management Bus (SMBus) Specification version  2.0; Reference: http://smbus.org/specs/  \n \n \n                                       CPR-1621-4M11 Specification \n \n \n \nPage 28 of 73 6.2.1 Addressing \nThe power supply PMbus device address locations are  shown below.  For redundant systems there are up \nto 2 signals to set the address location of the pow er supply once it is install in the system: A1, A0.   For \nno-redundant systems the power supply device addres s location should be 78h  \n \n \n \nNote: Non-redundant power supplies will use the 0/0  address location, 78h.   \n \n6.2.2  Hardware \nThe device in the power supply shall be compatible with both SMBus 2.0 ‘high power’ specification for \nI2C V dd  based power and drive (for Vdd = 3.3V).     \n \nThe power supply needs to have >4.7k Ohms internal pull up to 3.3V on the SDA or SCL lines and \noperate with 3.3V nominal voltage level. The equiva lent impedance on the SDA or SCL lines measured \nfrom I2C bus on output connector to 3.3V must be gr eater than 4.7K ohms when SDA & SCL is \noperating.  \n \nOne pin is the Serial Clock [SCL] (PSM Clock).  The  second pin is used for Serial Data [SDA] (PSM \nData).  Both pins are bi-directional, open drain si gnals, and are used to form a serial bus. The circu its \ninside the power supply shall derive their power fr om the standby output.   \n \nThe PMBus device shall be on whenever AC power is a pplied to the power supply or a parallel redundant \npower supply in the system.   \n \n1000ns maximum rise time for SDA and SCL \n300ns maximum fall time with a 400pF capacitive loa d for SDA and SCL \n10ns minimum fall time with a 20pF capacitive load for SDA and SCL \n \nSDA and SCL signal should have less than 300mVp-p r ipples and noise.  This ripple and noise is \nmeasured with 10-100MHz bandwidth and without addin g any external capacitor.  During the \nmeasurement, the SDA and SCL bus connection is left  open and the bus is idle at nominal voltages.   \n \n \n System addressing  \nAddress (A1) /Address (A2) 0/0  0/1 1/0 1/1 \nPower supply PMBus TM  device 78h  7Ah  7Ch  7Eh  \n                                       CPR-1621-4M11 Specification \n \n \n \nPage 29 of 73 6.2.3 Data Speed \nThe PMBus device in the power supply shall operate at 10 KHz to 100KHz and avoid using clock \nstretching that can slow down the bus.  For example , the power supply can clock stretch while parsing a \ncommand or a power supply servicing multiple intern al interrupts or NACK may require some use of \nclock stretching.  Unsupported commands may respond  with a NACK but must always set the \ncommunication error status bit in STATUS_CML. \n \nThe PMBus device shall support SMbus cumulative clo ck low extend time (Tlow: sext) if < 25ms.  This \nrequires the device to extend the clock time no mor e than 25ms between START and STOP for any given \nmessage \n \n6.2.4 Bus Errors \nThe PMbus device shall support SMBus clock-low time out (Ttimeout).  This capability requires the \ndevice to abort any transaction and drop off the bu s if it detects the clock being held low for > 25ms , and \nbe able to respond to new transaction 10ms later. \n \nThe device must recognize SMbus START and STOP cond itions on any clock interval.  (These are \nrequirement of the SMBus specifications, but are of ten missed in first-time hardware designs.) The dev ice \nmust not hang due to ‘runt clocks’, ‘rut data’, or other out-of-spec bus timing.  This defined as sign als, \nlogic-level glitches, setup or hold times that are shorter than the minimums specified by the SMBus \nspecification.  The device is not required to opera te normally, but must return to normal operation on ce \n‘in spec’ clock and data timing is again received.  Note if the device’ misses’ a clock from the maste r due \nto noise or other bus errors, the device must conti nue to accept ‘in spec’ clocks and re-synch with th e \nmaster on the next START or STOP condition.   \n \n6.2.5 Command \nThe following PMBus commands shall be supported for  the purpose of monitoring currents, voltages, and \npower.  All data should use the linear data format as documented in PMbus spec. \n \n \n                                       CPR-1621-4M11 Specification \n \n \n \nPage 30 of 73 \n \n \n \nPMBus command  Command \nOffset \nlocation Byte \nsize Description  Query \nCommand \nResponse \nPAGE  0x00 1 For setting the memory page for CLEAR_FAULT \ncommand.

The fi rst \ndata byte is the command of interest (ex. 0x86 for READ_EIN and 0x87 for READ_EOUT).  The \nsecond data byte indicates whether the host request ing the coefficients needed to encode a value to be  \nwritten to the device or the coefficients needed to  decode a value read from the device.  A value of \n01h in the second data byte indicates that the coef ficients needed to decode a value read from the \ndevice are being requested.
