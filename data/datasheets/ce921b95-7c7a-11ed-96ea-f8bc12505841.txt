The A port \nis designed to track V CCA. VCCA accepts any supply \nvoltage from 1.2 V to 3.6 V. The B port is designed \nto track V CCB. VCCB accepts any supply voltage from \n1.65 V to 5.5 V. This allows for universal low-voltage \nbidirectional translation between any of the 1.2-V, 1.5-\nV, 1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, and 5-V voltage nodes. V CCA \nmust not exceed V CCB.\nWhen the OE input is low, all outputs are placed in the \nhigh-impedance state. To ensure the high-impedance \nstate during power up or power down, OE must \nbe tied to GND through a pulldown resistor The \ncurrent sourcing capability of the driver determines \nthe minimum value of the resistor.\nThe TXB0104 device is designed so the OE input \ncircuit is supplied by V CCA.\nThis device is fully specified for partial power-\ndown applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry \ndisables the outputs, which prevents damaging \ncurrent backflow through the device when the device \nis powered down.\nDevice Information\n(1)PART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTXB0104RUT UQFN (12) 2.00 mm × 1.70 mm\nTXB0104D SOIC (14) 8.65 mm × 3.91 mm\nTXB0104ZXU/GXUBGA MICROSTAR \nJUNIOR™ (12)2.00 mm × 2.50 mm\nTXB0104PW TSSOP (14) 5.00 mm × 4.40 mm\nTXB0104RGY VQFN (14) 3.50 mm × 3.50 mm\nTXB0104YZT DSBGA (12) 1.40 mm × 1.90 mm\nTXB0104NMN NFBGA (12) 2.00 mm × 2.50 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nProcessor PeripheralVCCA VCCB\nTypical Application Block Diagram for TXB010XTXB0104\nSCES650J  – APRIL 2006 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The A port is able to accept I/O voltages ranging from 1.2 V to 3.6 V, while the B port can accept \nI/O voltages from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. The device is a buffered architecture with edge-rate accelerators (one-shots) \nto improve the overall data rate. This device can only translate push-pull CMOS logic outputs. If for open-drain \nsignal translation, please refer to TI’s TXS010X products.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVCCA VCCB\nOne\nShot\n4 k\rOne\nShot\nOne\nShot\nOne\nShot4 k\r4 k\r4 k\r\nOne\nShot\n4 k\rOne\nShot4 k\rA2\nA3A1\nB2\nB3B1OE\n2 channels\nA4 B4TXB0104\nSCES650J – APRIL 2006 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TXB0104\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Architecture\nThe TXB0104 device architecture (see Figure 8-1 ) does not require a direction-control signal to control the \ndirection of data flow from A to B or from B to A. In a DC state, the output drivers of the device maintain a high or \nlow, but are designed to be weak, so the output drivers can be overdriven by an external driver when data on the \nbus flows the opposite direction.\nThe output one-shots detect rising or falling edges on the A or B ports. During a rising edge, the one-shot turns \non the PMOS transistors (T1, T3) for a short duration, which speeds up the low-to-high transition. Similarly, \nduring a falling edge, the one-shot turns on the NMOS transistors (T2, T4) for a short duration, which speeds up \nthe high-to-low transition. The typical output impedance during output transition is 70 Ω at V CCO = 1.2 V to 1.8 V, \n50 Ω at V CCO = 1.8 V to 3.3 V, and 40 Ω at V CCO = 3.3 V to 5 V.\n4k\n4kA BVCCA VCCB\nOne\nShotOne\nShot\nOne\nShot\nOne\nShotT1\nT2\nT3\nT4\nFigure 8-1.

VT is the input threshold of the TXB0104 device, (typically V CC / 2).\nB. VD is the supply voltage of the external driver.\nFigure 8-2. Typical I IN vs V IN Curve\n8.3.3 Output Load Considerations\nTI recommends careful PCB layout practices with short PCB trace lengths to avoid excessive capacitive loading \nand to ensure that proper O.S. triggering takes place. PCB signal trace-lengths must be kept short enough such \nthat the round trip delay of any reflection is less than the one-shot duration. This improves signal integrity by \nensuring that any reflection sees a low impedance at the driver. The O.S. circuits have been designed to stay \non for approximately 10 ns. The maximum capacitance of the lumped load that can be driven also depends \ndirectly on the one-shot duration. With very heavy capacitive loads, the one-shot can time-out before the signal \nis driven fully to the positive rail. The O.S. duration has been set to best optimize trade-offs between dynamic \nICC, load driving capability, and maximum bit-rate considerations. Both PCB trace length and connectors add \nto the capacitance that the device output sees, so it is recommended that this lumped-load capacitance be \nconsidered to avoid O.S. retriggering, bus contention, output signal oscillations, or other adverse system-level \naffects.TXB0104\nSCES650J – APRIL 2006 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TXB0104\n8.3.4 Enable and Disable\nThe TXB0104 device has an OE input that is used to disable the device by setting OE = low, which places all \nI/Os in the high-impedance (Hi-Z) state. The disable time (t dis) indicates the delay between when OE goes low \nand when the outputs acutally get disabled (Hi-Z). The enable time (t en) indicates the amount of time the user \nmust allow for the one-shot circuitry to become operational after OE is taken high.\n8.3.5 Pullup or Pulldown Resistors on I/O Lines\nThe device is designed to drive capacitive loads of up to 70 pF. The output drivers of the TXB0104 device have \nlow dc drive strength. If pullup or pulldown resistors are connected externally to the data I/Os, their values must \nbe kept higher than 50 kΩ to ensure that they do not contend with the output drivers of the TXB0104 device.\nFor the same reason, the TXB0104 device must not be used in applications such as I2C or 1-Wire where an \nopen-drain driver is connected on the bidirectional data I/O. For these applications, use a device from the TI \nTXS01xx series of level translators.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe device has two functional modes, enabled and disabled. To disable the device, set the OE input to low, \nwhich places all I/Os in a high impedance state. Setting the OE input to high will enable the device.www.ti.comTXB0104\nSCES650J – APRIL 2006 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TXB0104\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

For a valid logic low, the value must be \nless than the V IL of the input port.\n• Output voltage range\n- Use the supply voltage of the device that the device is driving to determine the output voltage range.\n- External pullup or pulldown resistors are not recommended. If mandatory, it is recommended that the value \nmust be larger than 50 kΩ.\n• An external pulldown or pullup resistor decreases the output V OH and V OL. Use the below equations to draft \nestimate the V OH and V OL as a result of an external pulldown and pullup resistor.\nVOH = V CCx × R PD / (R PD + 4.5 kΩ)\nVOL = V CCx × 4.5 kΩ / (R PU + 4.5 kΩ)\nWhere\n• VCCx is the output port supply voltage on either V CCA or V CCB\n• RPD is the value of the external pull down resistor\n• RPU is the value of the external pull up resistor\n• 4.5 kΩ is the counting the variation of the serial resistor 4 kΩ in the I/O line.\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 9-1.

During power-up sequencing, V CCA ≥ VCCB does not \ndamage the device, so any power supply can be ramped up first. The device has circuitry that disables all output \nports when either V CC is switched off (V CCA/B  = 0 V). The output-enable (OE) input circuit is designed so that \nit is supplied by V CCA and when the (OE) input is low, all outputs are placed in the high-impedance state. To \nensure the high-impedance state of the outputs during power up or power down, the OE input pin must be tied to \nGND through a pulldown resistor and must not be enabled until V CCA and V CCB are fully ramped and stable. The \nminimum value of the pulldown resistor to ground is determined by the current-sourcing capability of the driver.\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo ensure reliability of the device, following common printed-circuit board layout guidelines is recommended.\n•Bypass capacitors must be used on power supplies, and must be placed as close as possible to the V CCA, \nVCCB pin and GND pin.\n•Short trace-lengths must be used to avoid excessive loading.\n•PCB signal trace-lengths must be kept short enough so that the round-trip delay of any reflection is less than \nthe one-shot duration, approximately 10 ns, ensuring that any reflection encounters low impedance at the \nsource driver.\n11.2 Layout Example\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n714\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n80.1 \x85F 0.1 \x85F\nTo Controller\nTo Controller\nTo Controller\nTo ControllerBypass\nCapacitorBypass\nCapacitorTXB0104PWR\nVCCA VCCB\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nNC\nGNDB1\nB2\nB3\nB4\nNC\nOETo System\nTo System\nTo System\nTo SystemLEGEND\nPolygonal \nCopper PourVIA to Power Plane\nVIA to GND Plane (Inner Layer)\nKeep OE low until V CCA and \nVCCB are powered upTXB0104\nSCES650J – APRIL 2006 – REVISED OCTOBER 2020 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TXB0104\n12 Device and Documentation Support\n12.1 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .

#### Description:
The **TXB0104** is a 4-bit bidirectional voltage-level translator designed to facilitate communication between devices operating at different voltage levels. It features two separate power supply rails, allowing the A port to operate between 1.2 V and 3.6 V, while the B port can operate between 1.65 V and 5.5 V. The device automatically senses the direction of data flow, eliminating the need for a direction control signal. It is particularly suited for applications requiring low-voltage logic level translation.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Consumer Electronics:** Used in headsets, smartphones, and tablets for interfacing different voltage logic levels.
- **Computing Devices:** Suitable for desktop PCs and other computing devices where different voltage levels need to be translated.
- **Communication Interfaces:** Ideal for applications that require bidirectional communication between devices with different voltage levels, such as microcontrollers and sensors.

The TXB0104 is particularly useful in scenarios where devices with varying voltage levels need to communicate without the risk of damaging either device due to voltage mismatches.
