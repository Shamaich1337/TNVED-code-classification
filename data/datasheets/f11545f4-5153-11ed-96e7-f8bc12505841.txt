System Overview\nThe CP2102/9 is a highly-integrated USB-to-UART Bridge Controller providing a simple solution for updating RS-\n232 designs to USB using a minimum of components and PCB space. The CP2102/9 includes a USB 2.0 full-\nspeed function controller, USB transceiver, oscillator, EEPROM or EPR OM, and asynchronous  serial data bus\n(UART) with full modem control signals in a compact 5 x 5 mm QFN-28 package. No other external USBcomponents are required.\nThe on-chip programmable ROM may be used to customiz e the USB Vendor ID, Product ID, Product Description\nString, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, and Device Serial Number as de sired for OEM applications.\nThe programmable ROM is programmed on-board via th e USB, allowing the programming step to be easily\nintegrated into the product manufacturing and testing process.Royalty-free Virtual COM Port  (VCP) device drivers provided by Silic on Laboratories a llow a CP2102/9-based\nproduct to appear as a COM port to PC applications . The CP2102/9 UART interface implements all RS-232\nsignals, including control and handshaki ng signals, so existing system firmwa re does not need to be modified. In\nmany existing RS-232 designs, all that is required to update the design from RS-232 to USB is to replace the RS-\n232 level-translator with the CP2102/9. Direct access driver support is  available through th e Silicon Laboratories\nUSBXpress driver set.\nAn evaluation kit for the CP2102 (Part Number: CP2102EK) is available. The kit includes a CP2102-based USB-to-\nUART/RS-232 evaluation board, a complete set of VC P device drivers, USB and RS-232 cables, and full\ndocumentation. Contact a Silicon Labs  sales representative or go to www.silabs.com  to order the CP2102\nEvaluation Kit. The CP2102 Evaluation Kit serves as  an evaluation kit for both the CP2102 and CP2109.\nCP2102/9\nRev. 1.8 52.  Ordering Information\nTable 1.

USB Function Controller and Transceiver\nThe Universal Serial Bus function controller in the CP2102/9 is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with\nintegrated transceiver and on-chip matching and pull-up resistors. The USB function controller manages all data\ntransfers between the USB and the UART as well as comm and requests generated by the USB host controller and\ncommands for controlling the function of the UART. \nThe USB Suspend and Resume signals are supported for power management of both th e CP2102/9 device as well\nas external circuitry. Th e CP2102/9 will enter Suspend mode when Susp end signaling is detect ed on the bus. On\nentering Suspend mode, the CP2102/ 9 asserts the SUSPEND and SUSPEND  signals. SUSPEND and SUSPEND\nare also asserted after a CP2102/9 reset until device  configuration during USB Enumeration is complete.\nThe CP2102/9 exits Suspend mode when any of the fo llowing occur: (1) Resume signaling is detected or\ngenerated, (2) a USB Reset signal is detected, or (3) a device reset occurs. On exit of Suspend mode, the\nSUSPEND and SUSPEND  signals are de-asserted.\nBoth SUSPEND and SUSPEND  temporarily float high during a CP2102/9 reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a\nstrong pulldown (10 k \uf057) can be used to ensure SUSPEND  remains low during reset. See Figure 5 for other\nrecommended options.\nFigure 5.

Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interface\nThe CP2102/9 UART interface consists of the TX (transmi t) and RX (receive) data signals as well as the RTS,\nCTS, DSR, DTR, DCD, and RI control signals. T he UART supports RTS/CTS,  DSR/DTR, and X-On/X-Off\nhandshaking.\nThe UART is programmable to support a variety of data fo rmats and baud rates. If the Virtual COM Port drivers are\nused, the data format and baud rate are set during COM port  configuration on the PC. If the USBXpress drivers are\nused, the CP2102/9 is configured through the USBXpress API. The data formats and baud rates available are\nlisted in Table 12.\nTable 12.

Internal Programmable ROM\nThe CP2102 includes an internal electrically erasable  programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the\nCP2109 includes an internal one-time programmable (OTP ) erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM).\nEither may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID (VID),  Product ID (PID), Product Description String, Power\nDescriptor, Device Release Number and Device Serial Number as desired for OEM applications. If the EEPROM/\nEPROM is not programmed with OEM data, the default configuration data shown in Table 13 is used. The\nEEPROM has a typical enduranc e of 100,000 write cycles with a data retention of 100 years. The EPROM can only\nbe written one time and cannot be erased.\nWhile customization of the USB configuration data is optional, it is recommended  to customize the VID/PID\ncombination. A unique VID/PID combinat ion will prevent the driver  from conflicting with any other USB driver. A\nvendor ID can be obtained from http://www.usb.org/  or Silicon Laboratories can provide a free PID for the OEM\nproduct that can be used with the S ilicon Laboratories VID. It is also re commended to customize the serial number\nif the OEM application is one in which it is possible for multip le CP2102/9-based devices to be connected to the\nsame PC.The internal programmable ROM is programmed via the US B. This allows the OEM\'s USB configuration data and\nserial number to be written to the CP2102/9 on-board ROM during the manufacturing and testing process. A stand-\nalone utility for program ming the internal progr ammable ROM is available from Silicon Laboratories. A library of\nroutines provided in the form of a Windows\n® DLL is also available. This library can be used to integrate the\nprogrammable ROM programming step into custom software  used by the OEM to streamline testing and serial\nnumber management during manufacturing.USB descriptors can be locked to prevent future modifi cation on the CP2102. The CP2109 can be programmed in-\nsystem over the USB interface by adding a capacitor to the PCB. If configuration ROM is to be programmed in-\nsystem, a 4.7 μF capacitor must be added between the V\nPP pin and ground. No other circuitry should be\nconnected to VPP during a programming operation, and VDD must remain at 3.3 V or higher to successfully\nwrite to the configuration ROM.\nTable 13.

CP2102/9 Device Drivers\nThere are two sets of device drivers available for the CP 2102/9 devices: the Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers and\nthe USBXpress Direct Access drivers. Only one set of drivers is necessary to interface with the device.\nThe latest drivers are available at http://www.silabs.com/support/P ages/software-downloads.aspx .\n9.1.  Virtual CO M Port Drivers\nThe CP2102/9 Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers allow a CP2102/9-based device to appear to the PC\'s\napplication software as a COM port. Application software running on the PC  accesses the CP2102/9-based device\nas it would access a standard hardware COM port. Howeve r, actual data transfer between the PC and the CP2102/\n9 device is performed over the USB in terface. Therefore, existing COM port applications may be used to transfer\ndata via the USB to the CP2102/9-based device witho ut modifying the application. See “AN197: Serial\nCommunications Guide for the CP210x” for Example Code for Interfacing to a CP2102/9 using the Virtual COM\ndrivers.\n9.2.  USBXpress Drivers\nThe Silicon Laboratories USBXpress driv ers provide an alternate solution for interfacin g with CP2102/9 devices.\nNo Serial Port protocol expertise is required. Instead, a simple, high-level  application program interface (API) is\nused to provide simpler CP210x c onnectivity and functiona lity. The USBXpress for CP210x Development Kit\nincludes Windows device drivers, Windows device driver installer and uninstallers, and a host interface function\nlibrary (host API) provided in the fo rm of a Windows Dynamic Link Libr ary (DLL). The USBXpress driver set is\nrecommended for new products that also include new PC software. The USBXpress interface is described in“AN169: USBXpress\n® Programmer\'s Guide.”\n9.3.  Driver Customization\nIn addition to customizing the device as described in "8 . Internal Programmable ROM" on page 17, the drivers and\nthe drivers installation package can be also be cust omized. See “AN220: USB Driv er Customization” for more\ninformation on generati ng customized VCP and USBXpress drivers. \n9.4.  Driver Certification\nThe default drivers that are shipped with the CP2102/9 are Microsoft WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs)certified. The certification means that the drivers have been tested by Microsoft and their latest operating systems(2000, Server 2003, XP, Vista,  7, and 8) will allow the drivers to be installed without an y warnings or errors. Some\ninstallations of Windows will prevent unsign ed drivers from being installed at all.\nThe customized drivers that are generated using the AN220  software are not automati cally certified. They must\nfirst go through the Microsoft Driver  Reseller Submission process. Contac t Silicon Laboratories support for\nassistance with this process.\nCP2102/9\nRev. 1.8 1910.  Voltage Regulator\nThe CP2102/9 includes an on-chip 5 to 3 V voltage regulato r. This allows the CP2102/9 to be configured as either\na USB bus-powered device or a USB se lf-powered device. These configurations are show n in Figure 6, Figure 7,\nFigure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10. When enabled, the 3 V voltage regulator output appears on the VDD pin and can\nbe used to power external 3 V devices. See Table 6 for the voltage regulator el ectrical characteristics.\nAlternatively, if 3 V power is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2102/9 can function as  a USB self-powered device with\nthe voltage regulator disabled. For this configuration, it is recommended that the REGIN input be tied to the 3 V net\nto disable the voltage regulator. In addition, if VDD or REGIN may be unpowered while VBUS is 5 V, a resistor\ndivider (or functionally-equivalent circuit) shown in Note  1 of Figure 8 and Figure 10 is required to meet the\nabsolute maximum voltage on VB US specification in Table 2.\nThe USB max power and power attributes descriptor must  match the device power usage and configuration. See\n“AN721: CP210x/CP211x Device Customization Guide” fo r information on how to customize USB descriptors for\nthe CP2102/9.\nNote: It is recommended to connect additional decoupling capacitance (e.g., 0.1 µF in parallel with 1.0 µF) to the REGIN input.\nFigure 6.

Porting Considerations from CP2102 to CP2109\nThis section highlights the differences between the CP 2102 and CP2109. These devices are designed to be pin-\ncompatible, and thus require very minor changes when porting hardware between devices. The CP2109 is an\nupdated, cost-reduced version of t he CP2102 with a one-time programmable ROM.\n11.1.  Pin-Compatibility\nThe CP2109 is pin-compatible with the CP2102 with a si ngle exception; the CP2109 requires an additional\ncapacitor between VPP and GND for in-application programming. This capacitor is not required after the CP2109\nEPROM has been successfully programmed or if the CP2109 does not need to be customized in system.\n11.2.  Distinguishing Factors\nThe CP2102 has 1024 bytes of EEPROM for vendor ID (VID), product ID (PID),  serial number, power descriptor,\nrelease number, and product description strings. This co nfiguration EEPROM can be wr itten and re-written multiple\ntimes. The CP2109 has 1024 bytes of one-time program mable EPROM for configurat ion. This configuration\nEPROM can only be written one time.\nThe CP2109 may require an additional capacitor on VPP if in-application programming is desired.\nThe CP2102 default serial number is always “0001”. Ev ery CP2109 is programmed from the factory with a unique\nserial number.\n11.3.  Differences in Electrical Specifications\nTable 14 and Table 15 list differences in absolute maximu m and electrical specificat ions between the CP2102 and\nCP2109. Refer to "3.
