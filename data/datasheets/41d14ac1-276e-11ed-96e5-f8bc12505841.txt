The APX811/812 asserts reset to prevent code-execution er rors \nduring power-up, power-down, or brownout conditions. They assert a reset signal whenever the V CC supply voltage declines below a \npreset threshold or the MR pin is brought low, keeping it asserted for at least 240ms after V CC has risen above the reset threshold. The \nAPX811/812 have a push-pull output stage. \n \nThe APX811/812 reset output is guaranteed to be logic low for the APX811 and high the APX812 for V CC > 1V. Once V CC exceeds the \nreset threshold, an internal timer keeps RESET  output low (and RESET high for the APX812) for the reset timeout period. After this \ninterval, the APX811’s RESET  output goes high (APX812’s RESET output goes low). If a brownout condition occurs (V CC dips below the \nreset threshold), the APX811’s RESET  output goes low (APX812’s RESET output goes high). Any time V CC goes below the reset \nthreshold, the internal timer resets to zero, and RESET  goes low (RESET goes high). The internal timer starts after V CC returns above \nthe reset threshold, and RESET  remains low (RESET remains high) for the reset timeout period. \n Ensuring a Valid Reset Output Down to V\nCC = 0 \nWhen V CC falls below 1V, the APX811 RESET  no longer sinks current-— it becomes an open circuit. Therefore, high-impedance \nCMOS logic inputs connected to RESET  can drift to undetermined voltages. This presents no problem in most applications since most \nµP and other circuitry is inoperative with V CC below 1V. However, in applications where RESET  must be valid down to 0V, adding a pull \ndown resistor to RESET  causes any stray leakage currents to flow to ground, holding RESET  low. R1’s value is not critical; 100k is \nlarge enough not to load RESET  and small enough to pull RESET  to ground.  \nFor the APX812 if RESET is required to remain valid for V CC < 1V then a 100k Ω pull-up resistor between RESET and V CC is \nrecommended.  \nBenefits of Highly Accurate Reset Threshold \nMost µP supervisor ICs has reset threshold voltages between 5% and 10% below the value of nominal supply voltages. This ensures  a \nreset will not occur within 5% of the nominal supply, but will o ccur when the supply is 10% below nominal. When using ICs rated  at only \nthe nominal supply ±5%, this leaves a zone of uncertainty where the supply is between 5% and 10% low, and where the reset may o r may \nnot be asserted. \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nAPX811/812 \n \n4-Pin Microprocessor Supervisor With Manual Reset\n \n \nAPX811/812 Rev. 2                                   8 of 10                                             OCTOBER 2009                \nD S 3 1 9 6 0                                  www.diodes.com                                              © Diodes Incorporated  \n \nMarking Information  \n \n \n(1) SOT143 \n \n1 23\nXXYW X( Top View )\nXX : Identification code\nW : Week : A~Z : 1~26 week;\nX : A~Z : GreenY : Year 0~9\na~z : 27~52 week; z represents\n52 and 53 week4\n \n \nDevice Package Identification Code \nAPX811-46U SOT143 C2 \nAPX811-44U SOT143  C3 \nAPX811-40U SOT143  C4 \nAPX811-31U SOT143  C5 \nAPX811-29U SOT143  C6 \nAPX811-26U SOT143  C7 \nAPX811-23U SOT143  C8 \nAPX812-46U SOT143  C9 \nAPX812-44U SOT143  CA \nAPX812-40U SOT143  CB \nAPX812-31U SOT143  CC \nAPX812-29U SOT143  CD \nAPX812-26U SOT143  CE \nAPX812-23U SOT143  CF \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nAPX811/812 \n \n4-Pin Microprocessor Supervisor With Manual Reset\n \n \nAPX811/812 Rev. 2                                   9 of 10                                             OCTOBER 2009                \nD S 3 1 9 6 0                                  www.diodes.com                                              © Diodes Incorporated  \nPackage Information  (All Dimensions in mm)  \n \n \n(1) Package Type: SOT143 \n \n1.20/1.40\n2.28/2.48\n2.80/3.01.58/1.831.78/2.03\n0.89/1.0\n0.37/0.51 0.77/0.93\n0.013/0.100.46/0.60.085/0.18\n8°typ.0.45/0.6\n  \nAPX811/812 \n \n4-Pin Microprocessor Supervisor With Manual Reset\n \n \nAPX811/812 Rev. 2                                   10 of 10                                             OCTOBER 2009               \nD S 3 1 9 6 0                                  www.diodes.com                                              © Diodes Incorporated  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE \n \nDIODES INCORPORATED MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARDS TO THIS \nDOCUMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A \nPARTICULAR PURPOSE (AND THEIR EQUIVALENTS UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION).   \n \nDiodes Incorporated and its subsidiaries reserve the right to make modifications, enhancements, improvements, corrections or ot her \nchanges without further notice to this document and any product described herein.
