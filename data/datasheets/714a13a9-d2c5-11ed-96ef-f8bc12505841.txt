ADP7102  with Adjustable Output Voltage, 5 V \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADP7102  is a CMOS, low dropout linear regulator that \noperates from 3.3 V to 20 V and provides up to 300 mA of output \ncurrent. This high input voltage LDO is ideal for regulation of high performance analog and mixed signal circuits operating from 19 V to 1.22 V rails. Using an advanced proprietary architecture, it provides high power supply rejection, low noise, and achieves excellent line and load transient response with just a small 1 μF ceramic output capacitor. \nThe ADP7102  is available in seven fixed output voltage options \nand an adjustable version, which allows output voltages that \nrange from 1.22 V to V\nIN − V DO via an external feedback divider. The ADP7102  output noise voltage is 15 μV rms and is \nindependent of the output voltage. A digital power-good output \nallows power system monitors to check the health of the output voltage. A user programmable precision undervoltage lockout \nfunction facilitates sequencing of multiple power supplies. \nThe ADP7102  is available in 8-lead, 3 mm × 3 mm LFCSP and \n8-lead SOIC packages. The LFCSP offers a very compact solution \nand also provides excellent thermal performance for applications requiring up to 300 mA of output current in a small, low profile footprint. \n \nADP7102 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

This is a \nstress rating only; functional operation of the product at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond \nthe maximum operating conditions for extended periods may \naffect product reliability. \nTHERMAL DATA \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in \ncombination. The ADP7102  can be damaged when the junction \ntemperature limit is exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature \ndoes not guarantee that T J is within the specified temperature \nlimits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature may have to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low \nprinted circuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum \nambient temperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction temperature is within specification limits. The junction temperature (T\nJ) of the device is dependent on the \nambient temperature (T A), the power dissipation of the device \n(PD), and the junction to ambient thermal resistance of the \npackage (θ JA).  \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) using the \nformula \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \nJunction to ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4-layer board. The junction to ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on the application and board layout.  In applications where high maximum power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal board design is required. The value of θ\nJA \nmay vary, depending on PCB material, layout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of θ\nJA are based on a 4-layer, \n4 in. × 3 in. circuit board. See JESD51-7 and JESD51-9 for detailed information on the board construction. For additional information, see the AN-617 Application Note , MicroCSP Wafer Level Chip \nScale Package . \nΨ\nJB is the junction to board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W . The package’s Ψ JB is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4-layer board. The JESD51-12, Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information, states that thermal characterization parameters are not the same \nas thermal resistances. Ψ\nJB measures the component power \nflowing through multiple thermal paths rather than a single \npath as in thermal resistance, θ JB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths \ninclude convection from the top of the package as well as radiation from the package, factors that make Ψ\nJB more useful in real-world \napplications. Maximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated \nfrom the board temperature (T B) and power dissipation (P D) \nusing the formula \nTJ = TB + (PD × ΨJB) \nSee JESD51-8 and JESD51-12 for more detailed information \nabout Ψ JB. \nThermal Resistance \nθJA and Ψ JB are specified for the worst case conditions, that is, a \ndevice soldered in a circuit board for surface-mount packages. \nθJC is a parameter for surface-mount packages with top mounted \nheat sinks. θ JC is presented here for reference only. \nTable 4.

E | Page 17 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADP7102  is a low quiescent current, low dropout linear \nregulator that operates from 3.3 V to 20 V and provides up to \n300 mA of output current. Drawing a low 750 μA of quiescent current (typical) at full load makes the ADP7102  ideal for battery \noperated portable equipment. Typical shutdown current \nconsumption is 40 μA at room temperature. \nOptimized for use with small 1 μF ceramic capacitors, the \nADP7102  provides excellent transient performance. \nSHUTDOWNVIN\nGND\nEN/\nUVLOVOUT\nREFERENCEVREG\nPGOOD PG\nSENSESHORT-CIRCUIT,\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\n10µA\n09506-055 \nFigure 60.

Adjustable Output Voltage Internal Block Diagram \nInternally, the ADP7102  consists of a reference, an error \namplifier, a feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. \nOutput current is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than \nthe reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower, \nallowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltage.  If the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the \ngate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing less current \nto pass and decreasing the output voltage.  \nThe ADP7102  is available in seven fixed output voltage options, \nranging from 1.8 V to 9 V , and in an adjustable version with an \noutput voltage that can be set to any voltage between 1.22 V and \n19 V by an external voltage divider. The output voltage can be set \naccording to the following equation: \nV\nOUT = 1.22 V(1 + R1/R2) \nVOUT = 5V VIN = 8V\nPGVOUT VIN\nPGGNDADJ\nEN/\nUVLORPG100kΩ\nR4\n100kΩR3\n100kΩCOUT\n1µFCIN\n1µF\nON\nOFF R2\n13kΩ+ + R1\n40.2kΩ\n09506-057 \nFigure 62. Typical Adjustable Output Voltage Application Schematic \nThe value of R2 must be less than 200 kΩ to minimize errors in \nthe output voltage caused by the ADJ pin input current. For example, when R1 and R2 each equal 200 kΩ, the output voltage is 2.44 V . The output voltage error introduced by the ADJ pin input current is 2 mV or 0.08%, assuming a typical ADJ pin input current \nof 10 nA at 25°C. \nThe ADP7102  uses the EN/UVLO pin to enable and disable the \nVOUT pin under normal operating conditions. When EN/UVLO \nis high, VOUT turns on; when EN is low, VOUT turns off. For \nautomatic startup, EN/UVLO can be tied to VIN. \nThe ADP7102  incorporates reverse current protections \ncircuitry that prevents current flow backwards through the pass \nelement when the output voltage is greater than the input voltage. A comparator senses the difference between the input and output \nvoltages. When the difference between the input voltage and output \nvoltage exceeds 55 mV , the body of the PFET is switched to V\nOUT \nand turned off or opened. In other words, the gate is connected \nto VOUT. \n \nADP7102 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 18 of 28 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADP7102  is designed for operation with small, space-saving \nceramic capacitors but functions with most commonly used \ncapacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the effective series resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 1 μF \ncapacitance with an ESR of 0.2 Ω or less is recommended to \nensure the stability of the ADP7102 . Transient response to changes \nin load current is also affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP7102  to large changes in load current. Figure 63 shows \nthe transient responses for an output capacitance value of 1 μF. \nCH2  50mV CH1 200mA M 20µs A  CH1      76mA1\n2\nT10.4%ΩBWBW\n09506-058LOAD CURRENT\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE\n \nFigure 63. Output Transient Response, V OUT = 1.8 V, C OUT = 1 μF \nInput Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 1 μF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the \ncircuit sensitivity to PCB layout, especially when long input traces \nor high source impedance are encountered. If greater than 1 μF of output capacitance is required, the input capacitor should be \nincreased to match it. \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the \nADP7102 , as long as they meet the minimum capacitance and \nmaximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufac-\ntured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a \ndielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the \nnecessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V to 50 V are recommended. Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not recommended, due to their \npoor temperature and dc bias characteristics.  Figure 64 depicts the capacitance vs. voltage bias characteristic \nof an 0402, 1 μF, 10 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage \nrating exhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the \nX5R dielectric is ~ ±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature \nrange and is not a function of package or voltage rating. \n1.2\n1.0\n0.80.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n02468 1 0CAPACITANCE (µF)\nVOLTAGE (V)\n09506-059 \nFigure 64. Capacitance vs. Voltage Characteristic \nUse Equation 1 to determine the worst case capacitance \naccounting for capacitor variation over temperature, \ncomponent tolerance, and voltage. \nCEFF = CBIAS × (1 − TEMPCO ) × (1 − TOL) (1) \nwhere: \nCBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage. \nTEMPCO  is the worst case capacitor temperature coefficient. \nTOL  is the worst case component tolerance. \nIn this example, the worst case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO) over −40°C to +85°C is assumed to be 15% for an X5R dielectric. The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed to be 10%, and \nC\nBIAS is 0.94 μF at 1.8 V , as shown in Figure 64. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields \nCEFF = 0.94 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 0.719 μF \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temperature \nand tolerance at the chosen output voltage. \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP7102, it is imperative \nthat the effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the \nbehavior of the capacitors be evaluated for each application. \nData Sheet ADP7102\n \nRev.

As shown in \nFigure 65, when a rising voltage on EN crosses the upper threshold, VOUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN/UVLO crosses the \nlower threshold, VOUT turns off. The hysteresis of the EN/UVLO \nthreshold is determined by the Thevenin equivalent resistance \nin series with the EN/ UVLO pin. \n2.0\n1.81.61.41.2\n1.0\n0.80.60.40.2\n1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 1.000VOUT, EN RISE\nVOUT, EN FALL\n09506-060 \nFigure 65. Typical V OUT Response to EN Pin Operation \nThe upper and lower thresholds are user programmable and can \nbe set using two resistors. When the EN/UVLO pin voltage is \nbelow 1.22 V , the LDO is disabled. When the EN/UVLO pin \nvoltage transitions above 1.22 V , the LDO is enabled and 10 μA hysteresis current is sourced out of the pin raising the voltage, thus providing threshold hysteresis. Typically, two external resistors program the minimum operational voltage for the LDO. \nThe resistance values, R1 and R2 can be determined from: \nR1 = V\nHYS/10 μA \nR2 = 1.22 V × R1/(VIN − 1.22 V) \nwhere: \nVIN is the desired turn on voltage. \nVHYS is the desired EN/UVLO hysteresis level.  \nHysteresis can also be achieved by connecting a resistor in series with EN/UVLO pin. For the example shown in Figure 66, the \nenable threshold is 2.44 V with a hysteresis of 1 V . \n  \n \n VOUT = 5V VIN = 8V\nPGVOUT VIN\nPG\nGNDSENSE\nEN/\nUVLORPG\n100kΩ\nR2\n100kΩR1\n100kΩCOUT\n1µFCIN\n1µF\nON\nOFF+ +\n09506-061 \nFigure 66.

The start-up time for the \n3.3 V option is approximately 580 μs from the time the EN active threshold is crossed to when the output reaches 90% of its final \nvalue. As shown in Figure 67, the start-up time is dependent on the \noutput voltage setting. \nTIME (µs)0 500 1000 1500 20006\n45\n3\n21\n0VOUT (V)5V\n3.3V\nENABLE\n09506-062 \nFigure 67. Typical Start-Up Behavior \nADP7102 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 20 of 28 POWER-GOOD FEATURE \nThe ADP7102  provides a power-good pin (PG) to indicate the \nstatus of the output. This open-drain output requires an external \npull-up resistor to VOUT. If the device is in shutdown mode, current-limit mode, or thermal shutdown, or if it falls below \n90% of the nominal output voltage, the power-good pin (PG) \nimmediately transitions low. During soft start, the rising threshold of the power-good signal is 93.5% of the nominal \noutput voltage. \nThe open-drain output is held low when the ADP7102  has \nsufficient input voltage to turn on the internal PG transistor. The \nPG transistor is terminated via a pull-up resistor to VOUT or VIN.  \nPower-good accuracy is 93.5% of the nominal regulator output \nvoltage when this voltage is rising, with a 90% trip point when \nthis voltage is falling. Regulator input voltage brownouts or glitches \ntrigger power no good signals if V\nOUT falls below 90%. \nA normal power-down causes the power-good signal to go low \nwhen V OUT drops below 90%.  \nFigure 68 and Figure 69 show the typical power-good rising and falling threshold over temperature. \n0123456\n4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0PG (V)\nVOUT (V)PG –40°C\nPG –5°CPG +25°CPG +85°CPG +125°C\n09506-063 \nFigure 68.

Typical Power-Good Threshold vs. Temperature, V OUT Falling \n NOISE REDUCTION OF THE ADJUSTABLE ADP7102  \nThe ultralow output noise of the fixed output ADP7102  is \nachieved by keeping the LDO error amplifier in unity gain and \nsetting the reference voltage equal to the output voltage. This architecture does not work for an adjustable output voltage LDO. \nThe adjustable output ADP7102  uses the more conventional \narchitecture where the reference voltage is fixed and the error \namplifier gain is a function of the output voltage. The disadvantage of the conventional LDO architecture is that the output voltage \nnoise is proportional to the output voltage. \nThe adjustable LDO circuit may be modified slightly to reduce \nthe output voltage noise to levels close to that of the fixed output ADP7102 . The circuit shown in Figure 70 adds two additional \ncomponents to the output voltage setting resistor divider. C\nNR \nand R NR are added in parallel with R FB1 to reduce the ac gain of \nthe error amplifier. R NR is chosen to be equal to R FB2; this limits \nthe ac gain of the error amplifier to approximately 6 dB. The actual gain is the parallel combination of R\nNR and R FB1, divided by R FB2. \nThis ensures that the error amplifier always operates at greater \nthan unity gain. \nCNR is chosen by setting the reactance of C NR equal to R FB1 − R NR \nat a frequency between 50 Hz and 100 Hz. This sets the frequency \nwhere the ac gain of the error amplifier is 3 dB down from \nits dc gain. \nVOUT = 5V VIN = 8V\nPGVOUT VIN\nPGGNDADJ\nEN/\nUVLO100kΩ\n100kΩ100kΩCOUT1µFCIN\n1µF\nON\nOFFRNR\n13kΩRFB2\n13kΩ+ + RFB1\n40.2kΩCNR100nF+\n09506-065 \nFigure 70.

E | Page 21 of 28 CURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADP7102  is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by current and thermal overload protection \ncircuits. The ADP7102  is designed to current limit when the \noutput load reaches 400 mA (typical). When the output load exceeds 400 mA, the output voltage is reduced to maintain a \nconstant current limit. \nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the \njunction temperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and/or high power dissipation) when the junction temperature starts to \nrise above 150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output \ncurrent to zero. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again, and output current is \nrestored to its operating value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground \noccurs. At first, the ADP7102  current limits, so that only 400 mA \nis conducted into the short. If self heating of the junction is \ngreat enough to cause its temperature to rise above 150°C, \nthermal shutdown activates, turning off the output and reducing the output current to zero. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 400 mA into the short, again causing the junction temperature to rise \nabove 150°C. This thermal oscillation between 135°C and 150°C \ncauses a current oscillation between 400 mA and 0 mA that \ncontinues as long as the short remains at the output. \nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect \nthe device against accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, device power dissipation must be externally limited \nso the junction temperature does not exceed 125°C. \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS \nIn applications with low input to output voltage differential, the \nADP7102  does not dissipate much heat. However, in applications \nwith high ambient temperature and/or high input voltage, the \nheat dissipated in the package may become large enough that it causes the junction temperature of the die to exceed the maximum \njunction temperature of 125°C.  \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction temperature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application \nis very important to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient temperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the package due to the power dissipation, as shown in \nEquation 2. To guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the \nADP7102  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction \ntemperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be aware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature \nchanges. These parameters include ambient temperature, power \ndissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between the junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent \non the package assembly compounds that are used and the amount \nof copper used to solder the package GND pins to the PCB. \nTable 6 shows typical θ JA values of the 8-lead SOIC and 8-lead \nLFCSP packages for various PCB copper sizes. Table 7 shows \nthe typical Ψ JB values of the 8-lead SOIC and 8-lead LFCSP . \nTable 6.

Typical Ψ JB Values \nModel Ψ JB (°C/W) \nLFCSP 15.1  \nSOIC 31.3 \nThe junction temperature of the ADP7102  is calculated from \nthe following equation: \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) (2) \nwhere: \nTA is the ambient temperature. \nPD is the power dissipation in the die, given by \nPD = [( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD] + ( VIN × IGND) (3) \nwhere: I\nLOAD is the load current. \nIGND is the ground current. \nVIN and V OUT are input and output voltages, respectively. \nPower dissipation due to ground current is quite small and can be ignored. Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to the following: \nT\nJ = TA + {[( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD] × θJA} (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given ambient temperature, input to output voltage differential, and continuous load current, there exists a minimum copper size requirement for the PCB to ensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C. Figure 71 to Figure 78 show junction temperature calculations for different ambient temperatures, power dissipation, and areas of PCB copper. \nADP7102 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
