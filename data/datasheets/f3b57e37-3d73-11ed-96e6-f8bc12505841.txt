The                   \nDirectFET™ package is compatible with existing layout geometries used in power applications, PCB assembly equipment and vapor \nphase, infra-red or convection soldering techniques, when application note AN-1035  is followed regarding the manufacturing methods \nand processes. The DirectFET™ package allows dual sided cooling to maximize thermal transfer in power systems.   \nThe IRF7769L1TRPbF is optimized for high frequency switching and synchronous rectification app lications. The reduced total loss es \nin the device coupled with the high level of thermal performance enables high efficien cy and low temperatures, which are key fo r            \nsystem reliability improvements, and makes this dev ice ideal for high performance power converters. \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings    \n  Parameter Max.
