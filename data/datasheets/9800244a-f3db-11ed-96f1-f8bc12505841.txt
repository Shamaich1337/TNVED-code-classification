The Si530/531 is availablewith any-rate output frequency from 10 to 945 MHz and select frequencies to1400 MHz. Unlike a traditional XO, where a different crystal is required foreach output frequency, the Si530/531 uses one fixed crystal to provide awide range of output frequencies. This IC based approach allows the crystalresonator to provide exceptional frequency stability and reliability. In addition,DSPLL clock synthesis provides superior supply noise rejection, simplifyingthe task of generating low jitter clocks in noisy environments typically found incommunication systems. The Si530/531 IC based XO is factory configurablefor a wide variety of user specifications including frequency, supply voltage,output format, and temperature stability. Specific configurations are factoryprogrammed at time of shipment, thereby eliminating long lead timesassociated with custom oscillators.\nFunctional Block Diagram\uf06eAvailable with any-rate output \nfrequencies from 10 MHz to 945 MHz \nand select frequencies to 1.4 GHz \n\uf06e3rd generation DSPLL® with superior \njitter performance\n\uf06e3x better frequency stability than SAW-based oscillators\uf06eInternal fixed crystal frequency \nensures high reliability and low \naging\n\uf06eAvailable CMOS, LVPECL, LVDS, and CML outputs\n\uf06e3.3, 2.5, and 1.8 V supply options\n\uf06eIndustry-standard 5 x 7 mm \npackage and pinout\n\uf06ePb-free/RoHS-compliant\n\uf06eSONET/SDH\n\uf06eNetworking\n\uf06eSD/HD video\uf06eTest and measurement\n\uf06eClock and data recovery\n\uf06eFPGA/ASIC clock generation\nFixed \nFrequency \nXO Any-rate\n10–1400 MHz \nDSPLL® \nClock \nSynthesis  VDD CLK+ CLK–\nOE GNDOrdering Information:\nSee page 8.\nPin Assignments:\nSee page 7.\n(Top View)Si5602\n1\n2\n36\n5\n4 GNDOEVDD\nCLK+CLK–NC\n1\n2\n36\n5\n4 GNDNCVDD\nCLKNCOE\n1\n2\n36\n5\n4 GNDNCVDD\nCLK+CLK–OESi530 (LVDS/LVPECL/CML)\nSi530 (CMOS)\nSi531 (LVDS/LVPECL/CML)REVISION  D\nSi530/531\n2 Skyworks Solutions, Inc. • Phone [781] 376-3000 • Fax [781]  376-3100 • sales@skyworksinc .com • www.skyworksinc.com\nRev. 1.5 • Skyworks Proprietary Information • Products and Produc t Information are Subject to Change Without Notice • March 3, 2022TABLE  OF CONTENTS\n1.

#### Description:
The Si530 is a crystal oscillator (XO) that operates within a frequency range of 10 MHz to 1.4 GHz, utilizing Skyworks Solutions' proprietary DSPLL® technology. This component is designed to provide low jitter clock outputs, making it suitable for high-frequency applications. Unlike traditional oscillators that require different crystals for each frequency, the Si530 uses a single fixed crystal to generate a wide range of output frequencies, ensuring high reliability and stability.

#### Typical Applications:
The Si530 is commonly used in various applications, including:
- **Networking**: For clock and data recovery in communication systems.
- **SONET/SDH**: As a timing source in synchronous optical networks.
- **Video Processing**: In SD/HD video applications for precise timing.
- **Test and Measurement**: For generating stable clock signals in testing equipment.
- **FPGA/ASIC Clock Generation**: Providing clock signals for field-programmable gate arrays and application-specific integrated circuits.

This component is particularly valuable in environments where low jitter and high frequency stability are critical, such as in telecommunications and high-speed data processing systems.
