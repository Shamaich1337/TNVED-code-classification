Pin Descriptions  \nSerial Clock (CLK) : The SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and \noutput operations.  \n \nSerial Data  Input, Output and I /Os (DI, DO and DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2, DQ 3): The FM25Q16A  \nsupports standard SPI, Dual SPI, Quad SPI and QPI operation. Standard SPI instructions use \nthe unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the devi ce on \nthe rising edge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO \n(output) to read data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \n \nDual/Quad SPI and QPI instructions use the bidirectional DQ pins to seriall y write instructions, \naddresses or data to the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the \ndevice on the falling edge of CLK. Quad SPI and QPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad \nEnable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.  When QE=1, the WP#  pin becomes DQ 2 and \nHOLD#  pin becomes DQ 3. \n \nChip Select (CS#) : The SPI Chip Select (CS#) pin enables and disables device operation. \nWhen CS# is high, the device is deselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2, \nDQ 3) pins ar e at high impedance. When deselected, the devices power consumption will be at \nstandby levels unless an internal erase, program or write status register cycle is in progress. \nWhen CS# is brought low, the device will be selected, power consumption will incr ease to active \nlevels and instructions can be written to and data read from the device. After power -up, CS# \nmust transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The CS# input must \ntrack the VCC supply level at power -up (see “9  Write Protection ” and Figure 68). If needed a \npull-up resister on CS# can be used to accomplish this.  \n \nHOLD (HOLD#) : The HOLD# pin a llows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. \nWhen HOLD# is brought low, while CS# is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals \non the DI and CLK pins will be ignored (don’t care). When HOLD# is brought high, device \noperation can  resume. The HOLD# function can be useful when multiple devices are sharing the \nsame SPI signals. The HOLD# pin is active low. When the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for \nQuad I/O, the HOLD# pin function is not available since this pin is used for DQ 3.  \n \nWrite Protect ( WP# ): The Write Protect ( WP# ) pin can be used to prevent the Status Registers \nfrom being written. Used in conjunction with the Status Register’s Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, \nBP2, BP1 and BP0) bits and Status Register Protect (SRP) bits, a  portion as small as a 4KB \nsector or the entire memory array can be hardware protected. The WP#  pin is active low. \nHowever, when the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the WP#  pin function is not \navailable since this pin is used for DQ 2. \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     6 \n7. Mem ory Organization  \nThe FM25Q16A  array is organized into 8,192 programmable pages of  256-bytes  each.  Up to \n256 bytes can be programmed (bits are programmed from 1 to 0) at a time.  Pages  can be \nerased  in groups  of 16 (4KB  sector  erase),  groups  of 128 (32KB blo ck erase), groups of  256 \n(64KB block erase)  or the entire  chip (chip  erase).  The FM25Q16A  has 512 erasable sectors , 64 \nerasable 32 -k byte blocks  and 32 erasable 64-k byte blocks respe ctively. The small 4KB sectors  \nallow  for greater flexibility in applicati ons that require  data and parameter storage.  \n \nTable 1 Memory Organization  \nBlock  \n(64KB)  Block  \n(32KB)  Sector  \n(4KB)  Address Range  \n31 63 \n| \n62 511 1FF000h 1FFFFFh  \n… … … \n496 1F0000 h 1F0FFFh  \n30 61 \n| \n60 495 1EF000h 1EFFFFh  \n… … … \n480 1E0000 h 1E0FFFh  \n29 59 \n| \n58 479 1DF000h 1DFFFFh  \n… … … \n464 1D0000 h 1D0FFFh  \n28 57 \n| \n56 463 1CF000h 1CFFFFh  \n… … … \n448 1C0000 h 1C0FFFh  \n27 55 \n| \n54 447 1BF000h 1BFFFFh  \n… … … \n432 1B0000 h 1B0FFFh  \n26 53 \n| \n52 431 1AF000h 1AFFFFh  \n… … … \n416 1A0000 h 1A0FFFh  \n25 51 \n| \n50 415 19F000h 19FFFFh  \n… … … \n400 190000 h 190FFFh  \n24 49 \n| \n48 399 18F000h 18FFFFh  \n… … … \n384 180000 h 180FFFh  \n23 47 \n| \n46 383 17F000h 17FFFFh  \n… … … \n368 170000 h 170FFFh  \n22 45 \n| \n44 367 16F000h 16FFFFh  \n… … … \n352 160000 h 160FFFh  \n21 43 \n| \n42 351 15F000h 15FFFFh  \n… … … \n336 150000 h 150FFFh  \n20 41 335 14F000h 14FFFFh  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     7 \nBlock  \n(64KB)  Block  \n(32KB)  Sector  \n(4KB)  Address Range  \n| \n40 … … … \n320 140000 h 140FFFh  \n19 39 \n| \n38 319 13F000h 13FFFFh  \n… … … \n304 130000 h 130FFFh  \n18 37 \n| \n36 303 12F000h 12FFFFh  \n… … … \n288 120000 h 120FFFh  \n17 35 \n| \n34 287 11F000h 11FFFFh  \n… … … \n272 110000 h 110FFFh  \n16 33 \n| \n32 271 10F000h 10FFFFh  \n… … … \n256 100000 h 100FFFh  \n15 31 \n| \n30 255 0FF000h 0FFFFFh  \n… … … \n240 0F0000 h 0F0FFFh  \n14 29 \n| \n28 239 0EF000h 0EFFFFh  \n… … … \n224 0E0000 h 0E0FFFh  \n13 27 \n| \n26 223 0DF000h 0DFFFFh  \n… … … \n208 0D0000 h 0D0FFFh  \n12 25 \n| \n24 207 0CF000h 0CFFFFh  \n… … … \n192 0C0000 h 0C0FFFh  \n11 23 \n| \n22 191 0BF000h 0BFFFFh  \n… … … \n176 0B0000 h 0B0FFFh  \n10 21 \n| \n20 175 0AF000h 0AFFFFh  \n… … … \n160 0A0000 h 0A0FFFh  \n9 19 \n| \n18 159 09F000h 09FFFFh  \n… … … \n144 090000 h 090FFFh  \n8 17 \n| \n16 143 08F000h 08FFFFh  \n… … … \n128 080000 h 080FFFh  \n7 15 \n| \n14 127 07F000h 07FFFFh  \n… … … \n112 070000 h 070FFFh  \n6 13 \n| \n12 111 06F000h 06FFFFh  \n… … … \n96 060000 h 060FFFh  \n5 11 95 05F000h 05FFFFh  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     8 \nBlock  \n(64KB)  Block  \n(32KB)  Sector  \n(4KB)  Address Range  \n| \n10 … … … \n80 050000 h 050FFFh  \n4 9 \n| \n8 79 04F000h 04FFFFh  \n… … … \n64 040000 h 040FFFh  \n3 7 \n| \n6 63 03F000h 03FFFFh  \n… … … \n48 030000 h 030FFFh  \n2 5 \n| \n4 47 02F000h 02FFFFh  \n… … … \n32 020000 h 020FFFh  \n1 3 \n| \n2 31 01F000h 01FFFFh  \n… … … \n16 010000 h 010FFFh  \n0 1 \n| \n0 15 00F000h 00FFFFh  \n… … … \n2 002000 h 002FFFh  \n1 001000 h 001FFFh  \n0 000000 h 000FFFh  \n \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     9 \n8.

Standard SPI  \nThe FM25Q16A  is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial \nClock (CLK), Chip Select ( CS#), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard \nSPI instructions use th e DI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device \non the rising edge of CLK. The DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on \nthe falling edge of CLK.  \n \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported . The primary difference between \nMode 0 and Mode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in \nstandby and data is not being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0, the CLK signal is \nnormally low on the falling and rising  edges of CS#. For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high \non the falling and rising edges of CS#. \nCS#\nCLK\nDI\nDOMODE3\nMODE0MODE3\nMODE0\nBit7Bit6Bit5Bit4Bit3Bit2Bit1Bit0\nBit7Bit6Bit5Bit4Bit3Bit2Bit1Bit0\nMSBMSBHIGH IMPEDANCEDONT CARE\n \nFigure 3 The difference between Mode 0 and Mode 3   \n \n8.2. Dual SPI  \nThe FM25Q16A  supports Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Dual \nOutput (3Bh)” and “Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to \nor from the device at two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices. The Dual SPI \nRead instructi ons are ideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -\nshadowing) or for executing non -speed - critical code directly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using \nDual SPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become bidirectional I/O pins: DQ 0 and DQ 1. \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     10 \n8.3. Quad SPI  \nThe FM25Q16A  supports Quad SPI operation when using instructions such as “Fast Read Quad \nOutput (6Bh)”, “Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh)”, “Word Read Quad I/O (E7h)” and “Octal Word Read \nQuad I/O (E3h)”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or  from the device four to six \ntimes the rate of ordinary Serial Flash. The Quad Read instructions offer a significant improvement in \ncontinuous and random access transfer rates allowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or execution \ndirectly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional DQ 0 and DQ 1 and the WP #  and HOLD#  pins become DQ 2 and DQ 3 respectively. Quad \nSPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.  \n8.4. QPI \nThe FM25Q16A  supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations only when the device is \nswitched from Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the “Enable QPI (38h)” instruction. \nThe typical SPI protocol requires that the byte -long instruction code being  shifted into the device only \nvia DI pin in eight serial clocks. The QPI mode utilizes all four DQ pins to input the instruction code, \nthus only two serial clocks are required. This can significantly reduce the SPI instruction overhead \nand improve system p erformance in an XIP environment. Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode and QPI \nmode are exclusive. Only one mode can be active at any given time. “Enable QPI (38h)” and \n“Disable QPI (FFh)” instructions are used to switch between these two modes. Upon power -up or \nafter a software reset using “Reset (99h)” instruction, the default state of the device is \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. To enable QPI mode, the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in \nStatus Register -2 is required to be set. When using QPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional DQ 0 and DQ 1, and the WP#  and HOLD#  pins become DQ 2 and DQ 3 respectively. See \nFigure 2 for the device operation modes.  \n8.5. Hold  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, the HOLD#  signal  allows the FM25Q16A  operation \nto be paused while it is actively selected (when CS# is low). The HOLD#  function may be useful \nin cases where the SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For example, \nconsider if the page buffer was only par tially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the \nSPI bus. In this case the HOLD#  function can save the state of the instruction and the data in the \nbuffer so programming can resume where it left off once the bus is available again. The HOLD#  \nfunction is only available for standard SPI and Dual SPI operation, not during Quad SPI or QPI.  \n \nTo initiate a HOLD#  condition, the device must be selected with CS# low. A HOLD#  condition \nwill activate on the falling edge of the HOLD#  signal if the CLK signa l is already low. If the CLK is \nnot already low the  HOLD#  condition will activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The HOLD#  \ncondition will terminate on the rising edge of the HOLD#  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If \nthe CLK is not already low the HOLD#  condition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK. \nDuring a HOLD#  condition, the Serial Data Output (DO) is high impedance, and Serial Data \nInput (DI) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip Select ( CS#) signal should be kept \nactive (low) for the full duration of the HOLD#  operation to avoid resetting the internal logic state \nof the device.  \nActive Active Active Hold Hold\n \nFigure 4 Hold Condition Waveform  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     11 \n9.  Write Protection  \nApplications that use non -volatile me mory must take into consideration the possibility of noise \nand other adverse system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this \nconcern, the FM25Q16A  provides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n \nWrite Protect Feat ures  \n\uf06c Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf06c Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf06c Write enable/disable instructions and automatic write disable after erase or program  \n\uf06c Software and Hardware ( WP#  pin) write protection using Status Register  \n\uf06c Write Protect ion using Power -down instruction  \n\uf06c Lock Down write protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf06c One Time Program (OTP) write protection for array and Security Sectors  using Status \nRegister.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down, the FM25Q16A  will maintai n a reset condition while VCC is \nbelow the threshold value of VWI, (See “12.3 Power -up Timing ” and Figure 68). While reset, all  \noperations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the VCC \nvoltage exceeds VWI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time \ndelay of t PUW. This includes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sect or Erase, Block Erase, Chip \nErase and the Write Status Register instructions. Note that the chip select pin ( CS#) must track \nthe VCC supply level at power -up until the VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached. If \nneeded a pull -up resister on CS# can be  used to accomplish this.  \n \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status \nRegister Write Enable Latch (WEL) set to “0”. A Write Enable instruction must be issued before a \nPage Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase,  Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will \nbe accepted. After completing a program, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) \nis au tomatically cleared to a write -disabled state of “0”. \n \nSoftware controlled write protection is facil itated using the Write Status Register instruction and \nsetting the Status Register Protect (SRP0, SRP1) and Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 \nand BP0) bits. These settings allow a portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire memory \narray to be config ured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write Protect ( WP# ) pin, \nchanges to the Status Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See Status \nRegister section for further information. Additionally, the Power -down instruction offers an extra \nlevel of write protection as all instructions are ignored except for the Release Power -down \ninstruction.  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     12 \n10. Status Register  \nThe Read Status Register instructions can be used to provide status on the availability of the \nFlash memory array, if the dev ice is write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection, Quad \nSPI setting, Security Sector lock status. The Write Status Register instruction can be used to \nconfigure the device write protection features, Quad SPI setting and Security Sector OTP lo ck. \nWrite access to the Status Register is cont rolled by the state of the non -volatile Status Register \nProtect bits (SRP0, SRP1), the Write Enable instruction, and during Standard/Dual SPI \noperations, the WP# pin.  \n \nFactory default for all Status Register b its are 0.  \n \nS6 S5 S7 S3 S2 S4 S1 S0\nSEC TB SRP0 BP1BP0 BP2 WELWIP\nSTATUS REGISTER PROTECT 0\n(non-volatile)\nSECTOR PROTECT\n(non-volatile)\nTOP/BOTTOM PROTECT\n(non-volatile)\nBLOCK PROTECT BITS\n(non-volatile)\nWRITE ENABLE LATCH\nERASE/WRITE IN PROGRESS\n \nFigure 5 Status Register -1 \nSUSS14 S13 S15 S11 S10 S12 S9 S8\nCMP LB QESRP1\nCOMPLEMENT PROTECT\n(non-volatile)\nQUAD ENABLE\n(non-volatile)\nSTATUS REGISTER PROTECT 1\n(non-volatile)SECURITY REGISTER LOCK BIT\n(non-Volatile)Error Status\n(volatile, Read only) ERR\nOutput Driver Strength\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)Suspend Status\n(volatile, Read only) DRV\n1DRV\n0\n \nFigure 6 Status Register -2 \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     13 \n10.1.  WIP Bit \nWIP is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 st ate when the device is \nexecuting a Page Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase, Write \nStatus Register or Erase/Program Security Sector instruction. During this time the device will \nignore further instructions except for the Read Status Regi ster instruction (see t W, tPP, tSE, tBE, \nand t CE in “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). When the program,  erase or write status  register  \n(or security  secto r) instruction has completed, the WIP bit will be cleared to a 0 state indicating \nthe device is ready for further instructions.  \n \n10.2.  Write Enable Latch (WEL)  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1 after \nexecut ing a Write Enable Instruction. The WEL status bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write \ndisabled. A write disable  state  occurs  upon  power -up or after any of the following instructions: \nWrite Disable, Page Program, Quad Page Program, Sector Erase, Block  Erase, Chip Erase, \nWrite Status Register, Erase Security Sector and Program Security Sector . \n \n10.3.  Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0)  \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register (S4, \nS3, and S2) that provide W rite Protection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using \nthe Write Status Register Instruction (see t W in “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). All, none  or \na portion of the memory array can be protected from Program and Erase instructions (see Table \n4 Status Register Memory Protection ). The factory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is \n0, none of the ar ray protected.  \n \n10.4.  Top/Bottom Block Protect (TB)  \nThe non -volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \nfrom the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in Table 4 Status Register \nMemory Protection  table. The factory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the \nWrite Status Register Instruction depending on the state of the SRP0, SRP1 and WEL bits.  \n \n10.5.  Sector/Block Protect (SEC)  \nThe non -volatile Sector/Bloc k Protect bit (SEC) controls if the Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) \nprotect either 4KB Sectors (SEC=1) or 64KB Blocks (SEC=0) in the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom \n(TB=1) of the array as shown in Table 4 Status Register Memory Protection  table. The default \nsetting is SEC=0.  \n \n10.6.  Complement Protect (CMP)  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S1 2). It \nis used in conjunction with SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide mor e flexibility for the \narray protection. Once CMP is set to 1, previous array protection set by SEC, TB, BP2, BP1 and \nBP0 will be reversed. For instance, when CMP=0, a top 4KB sector can be protected while the \nrest of the array is not; when CMP=1, the top 4 KB sector will become unprotected while the rest \nof the array become read -only. Please refer to Table 4 Status Register Memory Protection  table \nfor details. The default setting is CMP=0.  \n \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     14 \n10.7.  Status Register Protect ( SRP1, SRP0)  \nThe Status Register Protect bits (SRP1 and SRP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status \nregister (S8  and S7). The SRP bits control  the method  of write  protection:  software  protection,  \nhardware protection, power supply lock -down or one t ime programmable (OTP) protection.  \nTable 2 Status Register Protect bits  \nSRP1  SRP0  WP#  Status  \nRegister  Description  \n0 0 X Software  \nProtection  WP#  pin has no control. The Status register can be \nwritten to after a Write Enable instruct ion, WEL=1. \n(Factory Default ) \n0 1 0 Hardware  \nProtected  When WP#  pin is low the Status Register locked and can \nnot be written to.  \n0 1 1 Hardware  \nUnprotected  When WP#  pin is high the Status register is unlocked and \ncan be written to after a Write Enable in struction, WEL=1.  \n1 0 X Power Supply  \nLock -Down  Status Register is protected and can not be written to \nagain until the next power -down, power -up cycle.(1) \n1 1 X One Time  \nProgram  Status Register is permanently protected and can not be \nwritten to.  \nNote:  \n1. When SRP1, SRP0 = (1, 0), a power -down, power -up cycle will change SRP1, SRP0 to (0, 0) state.  \n \n10.8.  Output driver strength (DRV1, DRV0)  \nThe DRV 1 & DRV 0 bits are used to determine the output driver strength.  \nTable 3 Driver Strength bits  \nDRV1, DRV 0 Driver Strength  \n0,0 100%  \n0,1 75% \n1,0 50% \n1,1 25% \n \n10.9.  Erase/Program Suspend Status (SUS)  \nThe Suspend Status bit is a read only bit in the status register (S1 1) that is set to 1 after \nexecuting a Erase/Program Suspend (75h) instruction. The SUS st atus bit is cleared to 0 by \nErase/Program Resume (7Ah) instruction as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n \n10.10.  Error  Bit (ERR ) \nThe Error bit is a status flag, which shows the status of last Program /Erase  operation. It will be \nset to "1", if the Program /Erase  operation fails . If  the Program /Erase  region is protected , Error bit \nwill not be set to “1” . \n \n10.11.  Security Sector Lock Bit (LB ) \nThe Security Register Lock Bit (LB) is non-volatile One Time Program (OTP) bit  in Status \nRegister (S 10) that provide s the write pr otect control and status to the Security Register s. The \ndefault state of LB is 0, Security Register s are unlocked. LB can be set to 1  using the Write \nStatus Register instruction. LB bit is One Time Programmable (OTP), once it’s set to 1, the \nSecurity Regis ters will become read -only permanently.  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     15 \n10.12.  Quad Enable (QE)  \nThe Quad Enable (QE) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S9) that allows \nQuad SPI and QPI operation. When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default), the WP#  pin \nand HOLD# are enabled. When the QE bit is set to a 1, the Quad DQ 2 and DQ 3 pins are enabled, \nand WP#  and HOLD#  functions are disabled.  \n \nQE bit is required to be set to a 1 before issuing an “Enable QPI (38h)” to switch the device from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI to Q PI, otherwise the command will be ignored. When the device is in \nQPI mode, QE bit will remain to be 1. A “Write Status Register” command in QPI mode cannot \nchange QE bit from a “1” to a “0”.  \n \nWARNING: If the WP#  or HOLD#  pins are tied directly to the power  supply or ground \nduring standard SPI or Dual SPI operation, the QE bit should never be set to a 1.  \n \n10.13.

Instructions  \nThe Standard/Dual/Qua d SPI instruction set of the FM25Q16A  consists of 34 basic instructions \nthat are fully controlled through the SPI bus (see Table 6 ~ Table 8 ). Instructions are initiated with \nthe falling edge of Chip Select ( CS#). The first byte of data clocked into the DI  input provides the \ninstruction code. Data on the DI input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant \nbit (MSB) first.  \n \nThe QPI instruction set of the FM25Q16A  consists of 23 basic instructions that are fully \ncontrolled through the SPI bu s (see  Table 9 QPI Instructions Set ). Instructions are initiated with \nthe falling edge of Chip Select ( CS#). The firs t byte of data clocked through DQ [3:0] pins \nprovides the instruction code. Data on all four DQ pins are sampled on the rising edge of clock \nwith most significant bit (MSB) first. All QPI instructions, addresses, data and dummy bytes are \nusing all four DQ pins to transfer every byte of data with every two serial clocks (CLK).  \n \nInstructions vary in leng th from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address \nbytes, data bytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are \ncompleted with the rising edge of edge CS#. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instru ction \nare included in Figure 7 through Figure 72. All read instructions can be completed after any \nclocked bit. However, all instructions that Write, Program or Erase must complete on a byte \nboundary ( CS# driven high after a full 8 -bits have been clocked) otherwise the instruction will be \nignored. This feature further protects the device from inadvertent writes. Additionally, while the \nmemory is being programmed or erased, o r when the Status Register is being written, all \ninstructions except for Read Status Register will be ignored until the program or erase cycle has \ncompleted.  \n \n11.1.

Write Enable (WREN ) (06h)  \nThe Write Enable  (WREN) instruction ( Figure 7) sets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit i n the \nStatus Register to a  1.

Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h)  \nThe non -volatile Status Register bits described in section 10.1 can also be written to as volatile \nbits. This gives more flexibility to change the system configuration and memory protection \nschemes quickly without waiting for the typical non -volatile bit write cycles or affecting the \nendura nce of the Status Register non -volatile bits. To write the volatile values into the Status \nRegister bits, the Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must be issued prior \nto a Write Status Register (01h /31h) instruction. Write Enable for Volatile Status Register \ninstruction ( Figure 8) will not set the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit, it is only valid fo r the Write \nStatus Register instruction to change the volatile Status Register bit values.  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction(\n50h)CS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ30       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (50h)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\nD0\n(DQ1)High Impedance\n \nFigure 8 Write Enable for Volatile Status Register Instruction for SPI Mode (left) or QPI \nMode (right)  \n \n \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     23 \n11.8.  Write Disable  (WRDI)  (04h)  \nThe Write Disable (WRDI) instruction ( Figure 9) resets the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the \nStatus Register to a 0.

Read Status Register -1 (RDSR1)  (05h) , Status Register -2 \n(RDSR2)  (35h)  \nThe Read Status Register instructions allow the 8 -bit Status Registers to be read. The instruction \nis entered by driving CS# low and shifting the instruction code “05h”  for Status Register -1 or “35h” \nfor Status Register -2 into the DI pin on the rising e dge of CLK. The status register bits are then \nshifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown \nin Figure 10 and Figure 11. The Status Register bits are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. \n \nThe Read Status Register instruction may be used at any time, even while a Program, Erase or \nWrite Status Re gister cycle is in progress. This allows the WIP status bit to be checked to \ndetermine when the cycle is complete and if the device can accept another instruction. The \nStatus Register can be read continuously, as shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11 The instruction is \ncompleted by driving CS# high.  \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (05h/35h)CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 16     17     18     19     20     21     22     23 \n«=MSB « «Status Register 1/2 out\nD0\n(DQ1)High Impedance\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 7Status Register 1/2 out\n \nFigure 10 Read Status Register Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     24 \nMode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction\n05h/35hCS#\nCLK0       1 2       3 4       5\nDQ04       0 4       0 4       \nDQ1 5       1 5       1 5       \nDQ2 6       2 6       2 6       \nDQ37       3 7       3 7       \nSR1/2 outSR1/2 out \nFigure 11 Read Status Register Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.10.  Write Status Register -1(WRSR) (01h) , Status Register -2 \n(31h)  \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction allows the Status Register to be written. Only non -\nvolatile St atus Register bits SRP0, SEC, TB, BP2, BP1, BP0 (bits 7 thru 2 of Status Register -1) , \nCMP, DRV0, DRV1, LB,  QE, SRP1 (bits 14 and bit 12 thru 8 of Status Register -2) , can be \nwritten to. All other Status Register bit locations are read -only and will not b e affected by the \nWrite Status Register  (WRSR) instruction. LB is non-volatile OTP bit, once it is set to 1, it cannot \nbe cleared to 0. The Status Register bits are shown in  shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 and \ndescribed in 10 Status Register  \n \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must \nprevious ly have been executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register  (WRSR)  \ninstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is entered \nby driving CS# low, sending the instruction code “01h”, and then writing the  status register data \nbyte as illustrated in Figure 12 and Figure 13. \n \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction  \nmust have been executed prior to  the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction (Status Register \nbit WEL remains 0). However, SRP1 and LB, cannot be changed from “1” to “0” because of the \nOTP protection for these bits. Upon power off or the execution of a “ Reset (99h)” instruction, the \nvolatile Status Register bit values will be lost, and the non -volatile Status Register bit values will \nbe restored.  \n \nTo complete the Write Status Register (WRSR) instruction, the CS# pin must be driven high after \nthe eighth or  sixteenth bit of data that is clocked in. If this is not done the Write Status Register \n(WRSR) instruction will not be executed. If CS# is driven high after the eighth clock the DRV1,  \nDRV0,  CMP  and QE bits will be cleared to 0.  \n \nDuring non -volatile Status  Register write operation (06h combined with 01h), after CS# is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See \n“12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the \nRead Status Register instruction may still be accessed to check the status of the WIP bit. The \nWIP bit is a 1 during the Write Status Register cycle  and a 0 when t he cycle is finished and \nready to accept other instructions again. After the Write Status  Register cycle has finished, the \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     25 \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be cleared to 0.  \n \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combi ned with 01h), after CS# is driven high, \nthe Status Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  (See \n“12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). WIP bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit refresh \nperiod.  \n \nThe Write Status Register  (WRSR)  instruction can be used in both SPI mode and QPI mode. \nHowever, the QE bit cannot be written to 0 when the device is in the QPI mode, because Q E=1 \nis required for the device to enter and operate in the QPI mode.  \n \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (01h/31h)CS#\nCLK8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 \nStatus Register 1/2 inMode 3\nMode 0\nD0\n(DQ1)\n«=MSBDI\n(DQ0)\n«\nHigh Impedance7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n \nFigure 12 Write Status Register Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction\n01h/31hCS#\nCLK0       1 2       3\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ37       3SR 1/2\ninMode 3\nMode 0\n6       25       14       0 4       0\n5       1\n6       2\n7       3\n \nFigure 13 Write Stat us Register Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \nThe FM25Q16A  is also backward compatible to FMSH’s previous generations of serial flash \nmemories, in which the Status Register -1&2 can be written using a single “Write Register -1(01h)” \ncommand.

Read Data (03h)  \nThe Read Data instruction allows one or more data bytes to be sequentially read from  the \nmemory. The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and then shifting the instruction \ncode “03h” followed by a  24-bit address A23-A0 into the DI pin. The code and address bits are \nlatched on the rising edge of the CLK pin. After the addres s is received, the data byte of the \naddressed memory location will be shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with \nmost significant bit (MSB) first. The address is automatically incremented to the next higher \naddress after each byte of data is  shifted out allowing for a continuous stream of data. This \nmeans that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction as long as the clock \ncontinues. The instruction is completed by driving CS# high.  \n \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is show n in Figure 16. If a Read Data instruction is issued \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process ( WIP =1) the instruction is ignored and will \nnot have any effect  on the current cycle.

The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) \ncommand can either enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the following EBh \ncommands. When “Wrap Around” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either a 8, \n16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a  256-byte page. The output data starts at the initial address \nspecified in the instruction, once it reaches the ending boundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, \nthe output will wrap around to the beginning boundary automatically until CS# is pulled high to \nterminate the command.  \n \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applic ations that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address \nand then fill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing \nmultiple read commands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be  set. The W4 bit is used \nto enable or disable the “Wrap Around” operation while W6 -5 bits are used to specify the length of \nthe wrap around section within a page.

When \nQPI mode is enabled, the n umber of dummy clocks is configured by the “Set Read Parameters \n(C0h)” instruction to accommodate a wide range application  with different needs for either \nmaximum Fast Read frequency or minimum data access latency. Depending on the Read \nParameter Bits P[5: 4] setting, the number of dummy clocks can be configured as either 2, 4, 6 or \n8. The default number of dummy clocks upon power up or after a Reset instruction is 2. In QPI \nmode, the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M7 -0 are also considered as dummy clocks. In t he \ndefault setting, the data output will follow the Continuous Read Mode bits immediately.  \n \n“Continuous Read Mode” feature is also available in QPI mode for Fast Read Quad I/O \ninstruction. Please refer to the description on previous pages.  \n \n“Wrap Around” f eature is not available in QPI mode for Fast Read Quad I/O instruction. To \nperform a read operation with fixed data length wrap around in QPI mode, a dedicated “Burst \nRead with Wrap” (0Ch) instruction must be used.

It is recommended to input FFh on DQ 0 \nfor the next instruction (8 clocks), to ensure M4  = 1 and return the device to normal operation.  \nCS#\nIOs switch from\nInput to OutputA23-16     A15-8      A7-0       M7-0\nDQ0 20     16      12      8       4       0       4       0 4       0       4       0       4                               \nDQ1 21     17     13      9       5       1       5       1 5       1       5       1       5                               \nDQ3 23    19      15     11      7       3       7       3       7       3       7       3       7                               \nByte1 Byte2DQ2 22     18     14     10      6       2       6       2 6       2       6       2       6                               0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (E3h)CLK8       9      10     11     12     13     14     15 16     17     18     19     20     21  \n1        5                            \nByte3 Byte4 0        4               \n 2        6                          \n3        7                             \n \nFigure 28 Octal Word Read Quad I/O Instruction (Initial instruction or previous M5 -4 ≠ 10, \nSPI Mode only)  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     37 \n \nCS#\nIOs switch from\nInput to OutputA23-16     A15-8      A7-0       M7-0\nDQ0 20     16      12      8       4       0       4       0 4       0       4       0       4                               \nDQ1 21     17     13      9       5       1       5       1 5       1       5       1       5                               \nDQ3 23    19      15     11      7       3       7       3       7       3       7       3       7                               \nByte1Byte2DQ2 22     18     14     10      6       2       6       2 6       2       6       2       6                               0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0 CLK8       9      10     11     12     13  \n1        5                            \nByte3 Byte4 0        4               \n 2        6                          \n3        7                             \n \nFigure 29 Octal Word Read Quad I/O Instruction (Previous instruction set M5 -4 = 10, SPI \nMode only)  \n \n11.19.  Set Burst with Wrap (77h)  \nIn Standard SPI mode, the Set Burst with Wrap (77h) instruction is used in conju nction with “Fast \nRead Quad I/O” and “Word Read Quad I/O” instructions to access a fixed length of 8/16/32/64 -\nbyte section within a 256 -byte page. Certain applications can benefit from this feature and \nimprove the overall system code execution performance.  \n \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiated by driving the \nCS# pin low and then shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by 24 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap \nBits”, W7 -0. The instruction sequence is shown in Figure 30. Wrap bit W7 and the lower nibble \nW3-0 are not used.  \n \nW6, W5  W4 = 0  W4 =1 (default)  \nWrap Around  Wrap Length  Wrap Around  Wrap Length  \n0 0 Yes 8-byte No N/A \n0 1 Yes 16-byte No N/A \n1 0 Yes 32-byte No N/A \n1 1 Yes 64-byte No N/A \n \nOnce W6 -4 is set by a Set Burst with Wrap instruction, all the following “Fast Read Quad I/O” and \n“Word Read Quad I/O” instructions will use the W6 -4 setting to access the 8/16/32/64 -byte \nsection within any page. To exit the “Wrap Around” function and return to normal read operation, \nanother Set Burst with Wrap instruction should be issued to set W4 = 1. The default value of W4 \nupon power on is 1. In the case of a system Reset while W4 = 0, it is recommended that the \ncontroller issues a Set  Burst with Wrap instruction to reset W4 = 1 prior to any normal Read \ninstructions since FM25Q16A  does not have a hardware Reset Pin.  \n \nIn QPI mode, the “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instruction should be used to perform the Read \noperation with “Wrap Around”  feature.

Page Program (02h)  \nThe Page Program instruction allows from one byte to 256 bytes (a page) of data to be \nprogrammed at previously erased  (FFh) memory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be \nexecuted before the device wi ll accept the Page Program Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. The CS# pin must \nbe held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device. The Page \nProgram instruction sequence is shown in Figure 31 and Figure 32. \nIf an entire 256 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant \naddress bits) should be set to 0. If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks \nexceed s the remaining page length, the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In \nsome cases, less than 256 bytes (a partial page) can be programmed without having any effect \non other bytes within the same page. One condition to perform a partial page program is that the \nnumber of clocks can not exceed t he remaining page length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to \nthe device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page and overwrite previously sent \ndata.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bit  of the \nlast byte has been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. \nAfter CS# is driven high, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for time duration \nof t PP (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While the Page Program cycle is in progress, the \nRead Status Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the WIP bit. The \nWIP bit is a 1 during  the Page Program cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the \ndevice is ready to accept other instructions again. After the Page Program cycle has finished the \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Page Progr am instruction \nwill not be executed if the addressed page is protected by the Block Protect (CMP, SEC, TB, BP2, \nBP1, and BP0) bits.  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     39 \nCS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\n«7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«0       7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0  \nData Byte 239     40     41     42     43     44     45     46 47     48     49     50     51     52     53     54     55 \n2072\n2073\n2074\n2075\n2076\n2077\n2078\n2079\nMode 3\nMode 0\nData Byte 3 Data Byte 2560       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (02h)CS#\nCLK8       9      10              28     29     30     31 32     33     34     35     36     37     38     39 \n24-Bit Address\nDI\n(DQ0)\n« «23     22     21               3       2       1       0 Data Byte 1\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 \n«=MSB \nFigure 31 Page Program Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \n20      16      12       8        4        0        4        0 4        0        4        0                                 \n21      17      13       9        5        1        5        1 5        1        5        1                                    \n23      19      15      11       7        3        7        3 7        3        7        3      22      18      14      10       6        2        6        2 6        2        6        2        A23-16      A15-8       A7-0        Byte1       Byte2        Byte30       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 08       9      10     11     12     13    \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ34        0        4        0                                 \n5        1        5        1                                    \n7        3        7        3      6        2        6        2        Instruction\n02h\n   Mode 3\nMode 0516\n517\n518\n519\nByte 255    Byte 256\n \nFigure 32 Page Program Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.21.  Quad Input Page Program (32h)  \nThe Quad Page Program instruction allows up to 256 bytes of data to be programmed at \npreviously erased (FFh) memory locations using four pins: DQ 0, DQ 1, DQ 2, and DQ 3. The Quad \nPage Program can improve performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slow \nclock speeds <5MHz. Systems with faster clock speed will not realize much benefit for the Quad \nPage Program instruction since the inheren t page program time is much greater than the time it \ntake to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad Enable in Status Register -2 must be set (QE=1). A Write \nEnable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Quad Page Progra m \ninstruction (Status Register -1, WEL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low then \nshifting the instruction code “32h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 and at least one data byte, \ninto the DQ pins. The CS# pin must be held low for th e entire length of the instruction while data \nis being sent to the device. All other functions of Quad Page Program are identical to standard \nPage Program.

Chip Erase  (CE) (C7h / 60h)  \nThe Chip Erase instruction sets all memory within the device to the erased state of all 1s (FFh). A \nWrite Enable instruction must be executed before the device wi ll accept the Chip Erase \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# \npin low and shifting the instruction code “C7h” or “60h”. The Chip Erase instruction sequence is \nshown in Figure 40. \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched.

Erase / Program Suspend (75h)  \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction “75h”, allows the system to interrupt a Sector or Block \nErase operation or a Page Program operation and th en read from any other sectors or blocks. \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequence is shown in Figure 41 & Figure 42. \n \nThe Write Status Register instruction (01h) , and Erase /Program Security Registers instructions \n(44h, 42h), and  Erase instructions (20h, 52h, D8h, C7h, 60h) , and Page Program instructions \n(02h, 32h)  are not allowed during Erase /Program  Suspend. Erase /Program  Suspend is  valid only \nduring the Sector/ Block erase  or page program  operation. A maximum of time of “tsus” (See” 12.6 \nAC Electrical Characteristics ”) is required to suspend the erase or program operation.  \n \nThe Eras e/Program Suspend instruction “75h” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit \nin the Status Register equal  to 0 and the WIP bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a \nPage Program operation is on -going. If the SUS bit equal  to 1, or the WIP  bit equals to 0, the \nSuspend instruction will be ignored by the device. The WIP bit in the Status Register will be \ncleared from 1 to 0 within “t SUS” and the SUS bit in the Status Register will be set from 0 to 1 \nimmediately after Erase/Program Suspend. Fo r a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it \nis also required that the Suspend instruction “75h” is not issued earlier than a minimum of time of \n“tSUS” following the preceding Resume instruction “7Ah”.  \n \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     45 \nUnexpected power off during the Erase/Program s uspend state will reset the device and release \nthe suspend state. SUS bit in the Status Register will also reset to 0. The data within the page, \nsector or block that was being suspended may become corrupted.

Erase / Program Resume (7Ah)  \nThe Erase/Program Resume instruction “7Ah” must be written to resume the Sector or Block \nErase operation or the Page Program operati on after an Erase/Program Suspend. The Resume \ninstruction “7Ah” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit in the Status Register equals \nto 1 and the WIP bit equals to 0. After issued the SUS bit will be cleared from 1 to 0 immediately, \nthe WIP bit  will be set from 0 to 1 within 200ns and the Sector or Block will complete the erase \noperation or the page will complete the program operation. If the SUS bit equal  to 0 or the WIP bit \nequals to 1, the Resume instruction “7Ah” will be ignored by the devic e. The Erase/Program \nResume instruction sequence is shown in Figure 43 & Figure 44. \n \nResume instruction is ignored if the previous Erase/Program Suspend operation was inter rupted \nby unexpected power off.

Power -down (B9h)  \nAlthough the standby current during normal operation is relatively low, standby  current can be \nfurther reduced with the Power -down instruction. The lower power consumption makes the \nPower -down instruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See I CC1 and I CC2 in \n“12.4 DC Electrical Characteristics ”). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in Figure 45 & Figure 46. \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     47 \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the \nPower -down instruction will not be executed. After CS# is driven high, the power -down state will \nenter within the time duration of t DP (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While in the power -\ndown state only the Release from Power - down / Device ID instruction, which restores the device \nto norm al operation, will be recognized. All other instructions are ignored. This includes the Read \nStatus Register instruction, which is always available during normal operation. Ignoring all but \none instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condition for securing maximum write \nprotection. The device always powers -up in the normal operation with the standby current of I CC1. \ntDP\n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (B9h)\n      CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 45 Deep Power -down Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\nB9hCS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3tDP\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 46 Deep Power -down Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.29.  Release Power -down / Device ID (ABh)  \nThe Release from Power -down / Device ID instruction is a multi -purpose instruction. It can be \nused to release the device from the power -down sta te, or obtain the devices electronic \nidentification (ID) number.  \n \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the CS# pin \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     48 \nlow, shifting the instruction code “ABh” and driving CS# high as shown in Figure 47 & Figure 48. \nRelease from power -down will take the time duration of t RES1 (See “12.6 AC Electrical \nCharacteristics ”) before the device will resume normal operation and other instructions are \naccepted. The CS# pin must remain high during the t RES1 time duration.  \n \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruct ion is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy \nbytes. The Device ID bits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit \n(MSB) first as shown in Figure 47 & Figure 48. The Device ID value for the FM25Q16A  is listed in \nTable 5 Manufacturer and Device Id entification  table. The Device ID can be read conti nuously. \nThe instruction is completed by driving CS# high.  \n \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the \ninstruction is the same as previously described, and shown in Figure 49 & Figure 50, except that \nafter CS# is driven high it must remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See “12.6 AC Electrical \nCharacteristics ”). After this time duration the device will resume normal operation and other \ninstructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power -down / Device ID instruction is issued \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (when WIP equals  1) the instruction is \nignored and will not have any effect  on the current cycle.  \ntRES1\n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (ABh)\n      CS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)         \nPower-down currentStand-by current\n \nFigure 47 Release Power -down Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     49 \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\nABhCS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3tRES1\nStand-by current Power-down current \nFigure 48 Release Power -down Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (ABh)CS#\nCLK8       9              29     30     31 32     33     34     35     36     37     38        \n3 Dummy Bytes\nD0\n(DQ1)DI\n(DQ0)\n«tRES2 Mode 3\nMode 0\n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 High Impedance«23     22              2       1       0 \nDevice ID      \n«=MSB Power-down currentStand-by current\n \nFigure 49 Release Power -down / Device ID Instruction (SPI Mode)  \n \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     50 \nX       X      X       X       X      X       4       0\nX      X       X       X      X       X       5       1   \nX       X       X      X      X       X       7       3     X       X       X      X      X       X       6       2    3 Dummy Bytes  \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ3Instruction\nABh0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7         8\n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\n    \nIOs switch from\nInput to Output\nDevice ID\nPower-down currentStand-by currenttRES2 \nFigure 50 Release Power -down / De vice ID Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n11.30.  Read Manufacturer / Device ID (90h)  \nThe Read Manufacturer/Device ID instruction is an alternative to the Release from Power -down / \nDevice  ID instruction that provides both the JEDEC assigned manufacturer ID and the specific \ndevice ID.  \n \nThe Read Manufacturer/Device ID instruction is very similar to the Release from Power -down / \nDevice ID instruction. The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “90h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 of 000000h. After which, the \nManufacturer ID for Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group Co., Ltd  (A1h) and the Device ID \nare shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure \n51 & Figure 52. The Device ID value  for the FM25Q16A  is listed in Table 5 Manufacturer and \nDevice Id entification  table.

Read SFDP Register  (5Ah)  \nThe FM25Q16A  features a 256 -Byte Serial Flash Discoverable Parameter (SFDP) register that \ncontains information about device configurations, available instructions and other features. The \nSFDP parameters are stored in one or more Parameter Identification (PID) tables. Currently only \none PID table is specified. The Read SFDP Register instruction is compatible with the SFDP \nstandard initially established in 2010 for PC and other applications, as well as the JEDEC \nstandard 1.0 that is published in 2011.  \n \nThe Read SFDP instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shif ting the instruction \ncode “5Ah” followed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin.

Erase Security Sector  (44h)  \nThe FM25Q16A  offers one 1024 -byte Security Sector . The  Security Sector  may be used by the \nsystem manufacturers to store security and other important information separately from the main \nmemory array.  \n \nThe Erase  Security Sector  instruction  is similar  to the Secto r Erase  instruction.  A Write  Enable \ninstruction must be executed before the device will accept the Erase Security Sector  Instruction \n(Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instructio n code “44h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-A0 to erase Security Sector s. \n \nA23-16 A15-10 A9-0 \n00h 000000  Don’t Care  \n \nThe Erase Security Sector  instruction sequence is shown in  Figure 59. The CS# pin must be \ndriven high after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction \nwill not be executed. After CS# is driven high, the self -timed Erase Security Sector  operation will \ncommence for time duration of t SE (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics ”). While the Erase \nSecurity Sector  cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed \nfor checking the status of the WIP bit. The WIP bit is a 1 during the erase cycle and becomes a 0 \nwhen the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept other instructions again. After the \nErase Security Sector  cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Regis ter \nis cleared to 0. The Security Sector  Lock Bit ( LB) in the Status Register -2 can be used  to OTP \nprotect  the Security Sector s. Once  the LB bit is set to 1 , the Security Sector  will be permanently \nlocked, Erase Security Sector  instruction will be ignored.  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     59 \nDI\n(DQ1)DI\n(DQ0)CS#\nCLK\n«=MSBHigh Impedance23     22    2       1       0                                    \n«      Instruction (44h)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 08       9 \n24-Bit Address29     30     31Mode 3\nMode 0 \n Figure 59  Erase Security Sector  Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \n \n11.37.  Program Security Sector  (42h)  \nThe Program Security Sector  instruction is similar to the Page Program instruction. It allows from \none byt e to 256 bytes of Security Sector  data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) \nmemory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the \nProgram Security Sector  Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruc tion is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low then shifting the instruction code “42h” followed by a 24 -bit address A23-\nA0 and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. The CS# pin must be held low for the entire length \nof the instruction while data is being  sent to the device.  \n \nA23-16 A15-10 A9-8 A7-0 \n00h 0 0 0 0   0 0 \n 0 1 \n 1 0 \n 1 1 Byte Address  \n \nThe Program Security Sector  instruction sequence is shown in Figure 60.

Read Security Sector  (48h)  \nThe Read Security Sector  instruction is similar to the Fast Read instruction and allows one or \nmore data bytes to be sequentially read from the Security Sector . The instruc tion is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low and then shifting the instruction code “48h”  followed by a 24 -bit address \nA23-A0 and eight “dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the \nrising edge of the CLK pin. After the addre ss is received, the data byte of the addressed memory \nlocation will be shifted out on the DO pin at  the falling edge of CLK with most signifi cant bit (MSB) \nfirst. The byte address  is automatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of \ndata is shifted out. Once the byte address reaches 3FFh (the last byte of the register),  it will be \nreset to 00h  (the first byte of the register ) and continue to increment. The instruction is completed \nby driving CS# high. The Read Security Sector  instruction  sequence is shown in Figure 61. If a \nRead Security Sector  instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process \n(WIP =1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effect  on the current cycle. The Read \nSecurity Sector  instruction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of FR (see “12.6 AC \nElectrical Characteristics ”). \n \nA23-16 A15-10 A9-8 A7-0 \n00h 0 0 0 0  0 0 \n 0 1 \n 1 0 \n 1 1 Byte Address  \n \n0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 \n Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (48h)CS#\nCLK8       9      10              28     29     30     31 \n24-Bit Address\nDI\n(DQ0)\n«23     22     21               3       2       1       0 \n«=MSBHigh Impedance DI\n(DQ1)\nCS#\nCLK\nDI\n(DQ0)0       7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0  \nDummy Byte39     40     41     42     43     44     45     46 47     48     49     50     51     52     53     54    55 31     32     33     34     35     36     37     38 \n7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0       7\n« «7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 High Impendance DI\n(DQ1)Data Out 1 Data Out 2\n \nFigure 61 Read Security Sector s Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     61 \n11.39.  Set Read Parameters (C0h)  \nIn QPI mode, to accommodate a wide range of applications with different ne eds for either \nmaximum read frequency or minimum data access latency, “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” \ninstruction can be used to configure the number of dummy clocks for “Fast Read (0Bh)”, “Fast \nRead Quad I/O (EBh)” & “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instructions,  and to configure the number \nof bytes of “Wrap Length” for the “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” instruction.  \n \nIn Standard SPI mode, the “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” instruction is not accepted. The dummy \nclocks for various Fast Read instructions in Standard/Dua l/Quad SPI mode are fixed, please refer \nto Table 9 QPI Instructions Set  the Instruction  set for details. The “Wrap Length” is set by W5 -4 bit \nin the “Set Burst with Wrap (77h)” instruction. This setting will remain  unchanged when the device \nis switched from Standard SPI mode to QPI mode.  \n \nThe default “Wrap Length” after a power up or a Reset instruction is 8 bytes, the default number \nof dummy clocks is 2.  \nP5 – P4 DUMMY \nCLOCKS  MAXIMUM READ \nFREQ.  \n0 0 2 50MHz  \n0 1 4 80MHz  \n1 0 6 104MHz \n1 1 8 104MHz \n P1 – P0 WRAP LENGTH  \n0 0 8-byte \n0 1 16-byte \n1 0 32-byte \n1 1 64-byte \n \nDQ0CS#\nCLK\nDQ2DQ1\nDQ3   P7     P3   P6     P2P5     P1P4     P0Read\nParametersInstruction\nC0h0       1       2       3  \n Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\n \nFigure 62 Set Read Parameters Instruction (QPI Mode only)  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     62 \n11.40.

Enable QPI ( 38h) \nThe FM25Q16A  support  both Standard/Dual/Quad  Serial  Peripheral  Interface  (SPI)  and Quad \nPeripheral Interface (QPI). However, SPI mode and QPI mode can not be used at t he same time. \n“Enable QPI (38h)” instruction is the only way to switch the device from SPI mode to QPI mode.  \n \nUpon power -up, the default state of the device upon is Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. See Table \n9 QPI Instructions Set (15) for all supported SPI commands. In order to switch the device to QPI \nmode, the Quad Enable (QE) bit in Status Register 2 must be set to 1 first, and an “Enable QPI \n(38h)” instruction must be issued. If the Quad Enable (QE) bit is 0, the “ Enable QPI (38h)” \ninstruction will be ignored and the device will remain in SPI mode.  \n \nSee Table 9 QPI Instructions Set  Instruction Set for all the commands supported in QPI mode.  \n \nWhen the device is switched from SPI mode to QPI mode, the existing  Write Enable and the \nWrap Length setting will remain unchanged.  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     63 \nDI\n(DQ0)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (38h)CLKCS#\nD0\n(DQ1)High Impedance \nFigure 64 Enable QPI Instruction (SPI Mode only)  \n \n11.42.

Enable Reset (66h) and Reset (99h)  \nBecause of the small package and the limitation on the number of pins, the FM25Q16A  provide a \nsoftware Reset instruction instead of a  dedicated RESET pin. Once the Reset instruction is \naccepted, any on -going internal operations will be terminated and the device will return to its \ndefault power -on state and lose all the current volatile settings, such as Volatile Status Register \nbits, Wr ite Enable Latch (WEL) status, Read parameter setting P7-P0, Continuous Read Mode bit \nsetting M7-M0 and Wrap Bit setting W6-W4. \n \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” instructions can be issued in either SPI mode or QPI \nmode. To avoid accidental reset, bo th instructions must be issued in sequence. Any other \ncommands other than “Reset (99h)” after the “Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the \n“Reset Enable” state. A new sequence of “Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is needed to \nreset the device. On ce the Reset command is accepted by the device, the device will take \napproximately t RST=30μs to reset. During this period, no command will be accepted.  \n \nData corruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended internal Erase or Program \noperation whe n Reset command sequence is accepted by the device. It is recommended to \ncheck the BUSY bit and the SUS bit in Status Register before issuing the Reset command \nsequence.  \nD0\n(DQ1)High ImpedanceDI\n(DQ0)0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (66h)CLK0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (99h)CS#\n \nFigure 66 Enable Reset and Rese t Instruction Sequence (SPI Mode)  \n \nMode 3\nMode 0Mode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\n66hMode 3\nMode 00       1\nInstruction\n99hCS#\nCLK\nDQ0\nDQ1\nDQ2\nDQ3\n \nFigure 67 Enable Reset and Reset Instruction Sequence (QPI Mode)  \n \n                    Datasheet  \nFM25Q16A  16M-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY            Ver. 1.1                                     65 \n12.
