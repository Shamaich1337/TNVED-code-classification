The device is connected as follows:  \nProtection of two lines is achieved by connecting data \nlines at pins 1 & 2.  Pin 3 is connected to ground.  The \nconnection to ground should be made directly to a \nground plane.  The path length should also be kept as \nshort as possible to minimize parasitic inductance.\nMatte Tin Lead Finish\nMatte tin has become the industry standard lead-free\nreplacement for SnPb lead finishes.  A matte tin finish\nis composed of 100% tin solder with large grains.  Since \nthe solder volume on the leads is small compared to the \nsolder paste volume that is placed on the land pattern \nof the PCB, the reflow profile will be determined by \nthe requirements of the solder paste.  Therefore, these \ndevices are compatible with both lead-free and SnPb \nassembly techniques.  In addition, unlike other lead-free \ncompositions, matte tin does not have any added alloys \nthat can cause degradation of the solder joint.\nRClamp0582B\nFinal Datasheet Rev 3.0\nRevision Date 8/7/2017\nwww.semtech.com6 of 8\nSemtech\nOutline Drawing - SC75 3L\nLand Pattern - SC75 3LEDb\necA1A\n0.30\n0.20\n1.750.15\n0.10\n1.45\n1.00BSC-\n-\n1.601.60MILLIMETERS\nMAX\n0.100.90MINDIMENSIONS\n0.00NOM\n0.60\n--\nCONTROLLING DIMENSIONS ARE INMILLIMETERS (ANGLES INDEGREES ).NOTES:\nORGATE BURRS.DIMENSIONS "E1"AND "D"DONOT INCLUDE MOLD FLASH ,PROTRUSIONS 3.1.1.70 1.50\ne1 0.50BSC\nL1 (0.40)A2 0.75 0.60 0.80\nE1 0.80\nSIDE VIEWA\nbbb CABB\n0.85 0.75\nN 3\n0 -8° 0°\nDATUMS AND TOBEDETERMINED ATDATUM PLANE -A- -B- 2. -H-bbb 0.20aaa 0.101 23\nSEATING PLANEaaa C\nC\nSEE DETAIL AD\nE1E\nbxN\nA1A2 A\n0.25GAUGE\nPLANE\nA DETAIL01\n(L1)LH\ncDIM\nL 0.22\nee1\n0.10 0.30\nDIM\nY\nZXCMILLIMETERS\n(1.40)\n0.80\n2.200.40DIMENSIONS\nCONTROLLING DIMENSIONS ARE INMILLIMETERS (ANGLES INDEGREES).\nTHIS LAND PATTERN ISFOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY\nCONSULT YOUR MANUFACTURING GROUP TOENSURE YOUR\nCOMPANY\' SMANUFACTURING GUIDELINES ARE MET.NOTES:\n1.\n2.P1\nPG (C)X\nG 0.60\nP 1.00\nP1 0.50\nYZ\nRClamp0582B\nFinal Datasheet Rev 3.0\nRevision Date 8/7/2017\nwww.semtech.com7 of 8\nSemtech\nMarking Code\nP  8\nYW\n1 23\nNote: \nYW= Date Code\nTape and Reel Specification\nOrdering Information\nPart Number Qty per Reel Reel Size\nRClamp0582B.TCT 3,000 7”User Dire ction of Fe edP 8\nYW P 8\nYW P 8\nYW\nRClamp0582B\nFinal Datasheet Rev 3.0\nRevision date 8/7/20178 of 8\nSemtech\nContact Information\nSemtech Corporation\n200 Flynn Road, Camarillo, CA 93012\nPhone: (805) 498-2111, Fax: (805) 498-3804\nwww.semtech.comIMPORTANT NOTICE\nInformation relating to this product and the application or design described herein is believed to be reliable, however such information is provided as a \nguide only and Semtech assumes no liability for any errors in this document, or for the application or design described herein.
