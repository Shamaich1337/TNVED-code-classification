Thesedevices deliver a guaranteed 1A output current from twolithium-ion (Li+) batteries. Their wide-input voltage rangeof 2.7V to 14V gives design flexibility and allows batteriesto charge from a wall cube, since the ICs operate at thehigher voltages that occur when the battery is removed.The output voltage is preset to 3.3V or can be externallyadjusted from 1.25V to V\nIN.\nThe low on-resistance power switch and built-in synchro-\nnous rectifier provide high efficiencies of up to 96%.There are four modes of operation: fixed-frequency, nor-mal, low-power, and shutdown. The fixed-frequencyPWM mode of operation offers excellent noise character-istics. The normal mode maintains high efficiency at allloads. The low-power mode is used to conserve power instandby or when full load is not required. The shutdownmode is used to power down the device for minimal cur-rent draw.\nThe MAX1684 runs at 300kHz for applications that\nrequire highest efficiency. The MAX1685 runs at600kHz to allow the use of smaller external compo-nents. These devices can also be synchronized to anexternal clock. Other features include a 100% dutycycle for low-dropout applications, an auxiliary 3V/5mAoutput, and a 1% accurate reference. \nBoth devices are available in a space-saving 16-QSOP\npackage. An evaluation kit is also available to helpspeed designs. For a similar device in a 10-pin µMAXpackage with lower input voltage requirements (5.5Vmax), refer to the MAX1692 data sheet.\nApplications\nCellular Phones\nTwo-Way Radios and Walkie-TalkiesComputer PeripheralsPersonal CommunicatorsPDAs and Handy-TerminalsFeatures\noUp to 96% Efficiency\no1A Guaranteed Output Current\no100% Duty Cycle in Dropout \no2.7V to 14V Input Range (15V Absolute Max)\no±1% Accurate Reference Output \no0.24 ΩP-Channel On-Resistance\noSynchronizable Switching Frequency\noFixed-Frequency PWM Operation\n300kHz (MAX1684) \n600kHz (MAX1685)\no150µA Normal-Mode Quiescent Current\no25µA Low-Power Mode Quiescent Current\no2µA Shutdown Current\noDual Mode™ Fixed 3.3V (±1%) Output or \nAdjustable Output (1.25V to V IN)\noSmall 16-QSOP Package\noAuxiliary Output (CVL): 3V/5mAMAX1684/MAX1685Low-Noise, 14V Input, 1A, PWM \nStep-Down Converters \nMAX1684\nMAX1685LX IN\nAIN\nGNDOUTPUT\n3.3V AT 1AINPUT\n2.7V TO 14V\nBOOTSHDN\nCVH\nCVL\nSTBY\nSYNC/PWM\nFB CC REF+ +19-1454; Rev 2; 7/01\nPART\nMAX1684 EEE\nMAX1685 EEE -40°C to +85°C-40°C to +85°CTEMP RANGE PIN-PACKAGE\n16 QSOP\n16 QSOPEVALUATION KIT \nAVAILABLE\nTypical Operating CircuitOrdering Information\nPin Configuration appears at end of data sheet.\nDual Mode is a trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.\n________________________________________________________________ Maxim Integrated Products 1\nFor pricing, delivery, and ordering information, please contact Maxim/Dallas Direct! at \n1-888-629-4642, or visit Maxim’s website at www.maxim-ic.com.\nMAX1684/MAX1685Low-Noise, 14V Input, 1A, PWM \nStep-Down Converters \n2 _______________________________________________________________________________________ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\n(VIN= VSHDN = 6V, STBY = SYNC/PWM = CVL, V BOOT = VOUT, FB = AGND, circuit of Figure 1, TA= 0°C to +85°C , unless otherwise\nnoted.

(Note 5)\nNote 1: The output adjust range with BOOT connected to V OUTis VREFto 5.5V. Connect BOOT to AGND for V OUT> 5.5V.\nNote 2: The quiescent power-consumption specifications include chip supply and gate-drive loss only. Divide these values by V IN\n(6V) to obtain quiescent currents. In normal and low-power modes, chip supply current dominates and quiescent power is\nproportional to V BOOT (BOOT connected to OUT). In PWM mode, gate-drive loss dominates and quiescent power is propor-\ntional to V IN✕(VIN- VCVH). In addition, IR losses in power switches and external components typically increase PWM quies-\ncent power consumption by 5mW to 10mW. Note that if the device is not bootstrapped, additional power is dissipated in the\nCVL linear regulator.\nNote 3: When the duty factor (V OUT/ VIN) is less than this value, the switching frequency decreases in PWM mode to maintain\nregulation.\nNote 4: Thermal shutdown is disabled in low-power mode ( STBY = low) to reduce power consumption.\nNote 5: Specifications to -40°C are guaranteed by

They accept inputs from 2.7V to 14V anddeliver up to 1.6A. An internal MOSFET and synchro-nous rectifier reduce PC board area while maintaininghigh efficiency. Operation with up to 100% duty cycleminimizes dropout voltage. Fixed-frequency PWM oper-ation reduces interference in sensitive communicationsand data-acquisition applications. A SYNC input allowssynchronization to an external clock. The\nMAX1684/MAX1685 can operate in five modes. Settingthe devices to operate in the appropriate mode for theintended application (Table 1) achieves highest effi-ciency.\nPWM Control\nThe MAX1684/MAX1685 use an oscillator-triggered min-imum/maximum on-time current-mode control scheme(Figure 2). The minimum on-time is typically 220nsunless the regulator is in dropout. The maximum on-timeis 2 / f\nOSC, allowing operation to 100% duty cycle.\nCurrent-mode feedback provides cycle-by-cycle currentlimiting for superior load- and line-transient response.\nAt each falling edge of the internal oscillator, the inter-\nnal P-channel MOSFET (main switch) turns on. Thisallows current to ramp up through the inductor to theload and stores energy in a magnetic field. The switchremains on until either the current-limit comparatortrips, the maximum on-time expires, or the PWM com-parator signals that the output is in regulation. Whenthe switch turns off during the second half of eachcycle, the inductor’s magnetic field collapses, releasingthe stored energy and forcing current through the out-put diode to the output filter capacitor and load. Theoutput filter capacitor stores charge when the inductorcurrent is high and releases it when the inductor cur-rent is low, smoothing the voltage across the load.\nDuring normal operation, the MAX1684/MAX1685 regu-\nlate the output voltage by switching at a constant fre-quency and modulating the power transferred to theload on each cycle using the PWM comparator. A multi-input comparator sums three weighted differential sig-nals (the output voltage with respect to the reference,the main switch current sense, and the slope-compen-sation ramp) and changes states when a threshold isreached.

The MAX1684/MAX1685s’ loop gain is relatively low to enable the useof a small, low-value output filter capacitor. The 1.4%transient load regulation from 0 to 1A is compensatedby an integrator circuit that lowers DC load regulationto 0.01% typical. Slope compensation accounts for theinductor-current waveform’s down slope during thesecond half of each cycle, and eliminates the inductor-current staircasing characteristic of current-mode con-trollers at high duty cycles.\nPFM Control\nIn low-power mode, the MAX1684/MAX1685 switchonly as needed to service the load. This reduces theswitching frequency and associated losses in the P-channel switch, the synchronous rectifier, and theexternal inductor. During this PFM operation, a switch-ing cycle initiates when the PFM comparator sensesthat the output voltage has dropped too low. The P-channel MOSFET switch turns on and conducts cur-rent to the output-filter capacitor and load. TheMAX1684/MAX1685 then wait until the PFM comparatorsenses a low-output voltage again.\nIn normal mode at light load (<150mA), the device also\noperates in PFM. The PFM current comparator controlsboth entry into PWM mode and the peak switch currentduring PFM operation. Consequently, some jitter is nor-mal during transition from PFM to PWM with loadsaround 150mA, and it has no adverse impact on regu-lation.\n100% Duty-Cycle Operation\nAs the input voltage drops, the duty cycle increasesuntil the P-channel MOSFET turns on continuously,achieving 100% duty cycle. Dropout voltage in 100%duty cycle is the output current multiplied by the on-resistance of the internal switch and inductor, approxi-mately 0.35V (I\nOUT= 1A).\nVery Low Duty-Cycle Operation\nBecause of the P-channel minimum on-time and dead-time (duration when both switches are off), theMAX1684/MAX1685s’ switching frequency mustdecrease in PWM or normal mode to maintain regula-tion at a very low duty cycle. The total P-channel on-time and dead-time is 290ns typical. As a result, theMAX1684/MAX1685 maintain fixed-frequency regula-tion at no load for V\nINup to 10V OUT and 5V OUT,\nrespectively (see PWM Fixed-Frequency OperationArea graph in the Typical Operating Characteristics ).For higher V\nINat no load, the frequency decreases\nbased on the following equation:\nf = V OUT/ (VIN×290ns)\nAt medium- to full-load current (>100mA), V INcan\nincrease slightly higher before the frequency decreas-es.\nSynchronous Rectification\nAlthough the primary rectifier is an external Schottkydiode, a small internal N-channel synchronous rectifierallows PWM operation at light loads. During the secondhalf of each cycle, when the inductor current rampsbelow the zero-crossing threshold or when the oscilla-tor period ends, the synchronous rectifier turns off. Thiskeeps excess current from flowing backward throughthe inductor. Choose an appropriate inductor to limitthe PWM ripple current through the N-channel FET to400mA\nP-P.\nCurrent Limit and Soft-Start\nThe voltage at ILIM/SS sets the PWM current limit (I\nLIM= 1.75A) and the low-power current limit (I LIMLP =\n380mA). The PWM current limit applies when thedevice is in PWM mode, in synchronized PWM mode,or delivering a heavy load in normal mode (Table 1).The I\nLIMLP limit applies when the device is in low-power\nmode. An internal 4µA current source pulls ILIM/SS upto CVL. To use the maximum current-limit thresholds,leave ILIM/SS unconnected or connect it to a soft-startcapacitor. Connect an external resistor from ILIM/SS toAGND to adjust the current-limit thresholds. \nThe PWM current-limit threshold is (I\nLIM ✕RILIM/SS ✕\n4µA) / V REFand is adjustable from 0.5A to 1.75A. \nThe low-power current-limit threshold is equal to (I LIMLP\n✕RILIM/SS ✕4µA) / V REFand is adjustable from 110mA\nto 380mA. \nFor example, when R ILIM/SS is 156k Ω, the PWM current\nlimit threshold is 0.88A and the low-power current limitthreshold is 0.19A.\nConnect a low-value capacitor from ILIM/SS to AGND\nto achieve soft-start, limiting inrush current. ILIM/SSinternally shorts to AGND in shutdown to discharge thesoft-start capacitor. Do not connect ILIM/SS to REF orCVL. Determine the soft-start duration by:\nt\nSOFT-START = CILIM/SS (1.25V / 4µA)\nwhere t SOFT-START is the time from SHDN going high to\nthe regulator being able to supply full load current. Forexample, a 0.1µF capacitor yields 31ms of soft-start.\nMAX1684/MAX1685Low-Noise, 14V Input, 1A, PWM \nStep-Down Converters \n______________________________________________________________________________________ 11The output current capability for each mode is deter-\nmined by the following equations:\nIOUTMAX = ILIM- 0.5 ✕IRIPPLE (for PWM and normal\nmodes)\nIOUTMAX = 0.5 ✕ILIMLP (for low-power mode)\nwhere:I\nRIPPLE = ripple current = (V IN- VOUT) ✕VOUT / (VIN✕\nfOSC ✕L)\nILIM= current limit in PWM mode\nILIMLP = current limit in low-power mode\nInternal Low-Voltage Regulators and\nBootstrap (BOOT)\nThe MAX1684/MAX1685 have two internal regulators\n(VH and VL) that generate low-voltage supplies forinternal circuitry (see the Functional Diagram ). The VH\nregulator generates -4.6V with respect to IN to supplythe P-channel switch and driver. Bypass CVH to IN witha 0.1µF capacitor. The VL regulator generates a 3V out-put at CVL to supply internal low-voltage blocks, as wellas the N-channel switch and driver. Bypass CVL toAGND with a 1µF capacitor.\nTo reduce the quiescent current in low-power and nor-\nmal modes, connect BOOT to OUT. After startup, whenV\nBOOT exceeds 2.6V, the internal bootstrap switch con-\nnects CVL to BOOT. This bootstrap mechanism causesthe internal circuitry to be supplied from the output andthereby reduces the input quiescent current by a factorof V\nOUT / VIN. Do not connect BOOT to OUT if the out-\nput voltage exceeds 5.5V. Instead, connect BOOT toAGND to keep CVL regulated at 3V.\nCVL has a 5mA capability to supply external logic cir-\ncuitry and is disabled in shutdown mode.\nApplications Information\nOutput Voltage Selection\nConnect FB to AGND to select the internal 3.3V outputmode. Connect BOOT to OUT in this configuration.\nTo select an output voltage between 1.25V and V\nIN,\nconnect FB to a resistor voltage-divider between theoutput and AGND (Figure 3). Select R2 in the 20k Ωto\n100k Ωrange. Calculate R1 as follows:\nR1 = R2 [( V\nOUT/ VFB) - 1]\nwhere V FB= 1.25V. Connect a small capacitor across R1 to compensate for\nstray capacitance at the FB pin: \nwhere: R2 = 100k Ω, use 4.7pF.\nInductor Selection\nThe MAX1684/MAX1685s’ high switching frequency\nallows the use of small surface-mount inductors. Table 2shows a selection of suitable inductors for different out-put voltage ranges. Calculate the minimum inductor by:\nL = 0.9(V\nOUT - 0.3V) / (I RIPPLE MAX ×fOSC)\nwhere:I\nRIPPLE MAX = should be less than or equal to 400mA\nfOSC =  300kHz (MAX1684) or 600kHz (MAX1685)\nCapacitor Selection\nSelect input and output filter capacitors to service\ninductor currents while minimizing voltage ripple. Theinput filter capacitor reduces peak currents and noiseat the voltage source. The MAX1684/MAX1685s’ loopgain is relatively low to enable the use of small, low-value output filter capacitors. Higher capacitor valuesprovide improved output ripple and transient response. \nLow-ESR capacitors are recommended. Capacitor ESR\nis a major contributor to output ripple (usually morethan 60%). Avoid ordinary aluminum electrolytic capac-itors, as they typically have high ESR. Low-ESR alu-minum electrolytic capacitors are acceptable andrelatively inexpensive. Low-ESR tantalum capacitorsare better and provide a compact solution for space-constrained surface-mount designs. Do not exceed theripple-current ratings of tantalum capacitors. Ceramiccapacitors offer the lowest ESR overall. Sanyo OS-CONC1 5  (10\nR7\n2=−)MAX1684\nMAX1685\nFBVOUT\nR1 C1\nR2\nFigure 3.

Use a Schottky diode to avoid forward bias-ing the internal body diode of the N-channel MOSFET.\n12 ______________________________________________________________________________________Sumida 847-956-0666 847-956-0702Sprague 603-224-1961 603-224-1430\nMotorola 602-303-5454 602-994-6430DIODESTDK 847-390-4373 847-390-4428Murata-Erie 814-237-1431 814-238-0490Coilcraft 847-639-6400 847-639-1469INDUCTORSSanyo 619-661-6835 619-661-1055Matsuo 714-969-2591 714-960-6492AVX 803-946-0690 803-626-3123FAX\nCAPACITORSPHONE SUPPLIER\nInverting Output\nInterchanging the ground and V OUT connections yields\na negative voltage supply (Figure 4).
