This device uses a silicon\ndioxide (SiO 2) insulation barrier with a withstand\nvoltage of 3000 V RMS and a working voltage of 450\nVRMS. Electromagnetic compatibility has been\nsignificantly enhanced to enable system-level ESD,\nEFT, surge, and emissions compliance. Used in\nconjunction with isolated power supplies, the device\nprotects against high voltage, and prevents noise\ncurrents from the bus from entering the local ground.\nThe ISO1044B device supports a wide ambient\ntemperature range of –40°C to +125°C. The device is\navailable in the small SOIC-8 (D) package which\nsignificantly reduces the solution size compared to a\ntraditional approach using optocouplers to isolate the\nCAN transceiver.\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER(1)PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nISO1044B SOIC (8) 4.90 mm × 3.91 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at\nthe end of the data sheet.\n1\n2\n436\n5\n7TXDVCC1\nRXD\nGND1CANL\nGND28\nVCC2\nMCU\nRXDTXDVDD\nDGND\nDigital\nGroundISO \nGroundCAN Bus\nGalvanic\nIsolation BarrierISO1044CANHVCC1VCC2\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nApplication Diagramwww.ti.comISO1044\nSLLSFB0A – MARCH 2020 – REVISED JULY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 1\nProduct Folder Links: ISO1044ISO1044\nSLLSFB0A – MARCH 2020 – REVISED JULY 2020\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications,\nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The device supports up to 5-Mbps data rate in CAN FD mode allowing much\nfaster transfer of payload compared to classic CAN. The ISO1044B device has an isolation withstand voltage of\n3000 V RMS with a surge isolation voltage of 5kV PK. The device can operate from 1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, and 5-V\nsupplies on side 1 and a 5-V supply on side 2. This supply range is of particular advantage for applications\noperating in harsh industrial environments because the low voltage on side 1 enables the connection to low-\nvoltage microcontrollers for power conservation, whereas the 5 V on side 2 maintains a high signal-to-noise ratio\nof the bus signals.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n+\n±RXD\nTXDVCC1\nGND1VCC2\nGND2CANH\nCANLGALVANIC ISOLATION\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 CAN Bus States\nThe CAN bus has two states during operation: dominant  and recessive . A dominant bus state, equivalent to logic\nlow, is when the bus is driven differentially by a driver. A recessive bus state is when the bus is biased to a\ncommon mode of V CC / 2 through the high-resistance internal input resistors of the receiver, equivalent to a logic\nhigh. The host microprocessor of the CAN node uses the TXD pin to drive the bus and receives data from the\nbus on the RXD pin.

The DTO circuit\ntimer starts on a falling edge on the TXD pin. The DTO circuit disables the CAN bus driver if no rising edge\noccurs before the timeout period expires, which frees the bus for communication between other nodes on the\nnetwork. The CAN driver is activated again when a recessive signal occurs on the TXD pin, clearing the TXD\nDTO condition. The receiver and RXD pin still reflect activity on the CAN bus, and the bus terminals are biased\nto the recessive level during a TXD dominant timeout.www.ti.comISO1044\nSLLSFB0A – MARCH 2020 – REVISED JULY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: ISO1044\nRXD\n(receiver)TXD\n(driver)\nCAN\nBus\nSignalNormal CAN \ncommunicationTXD fault stuck dominant\nExample: PCB failure or bad software\nDriver disabled freeing bus for other nodes\nBus would be stuck dominant , blocking communication for the \nwhole network but TXD DTO prevents this and frees the bus for \ncommunication after the t TXD_DTO  time.tTXD_DTO\ntTXD_DTOFault is repaired and transmission \ncapability is restored\nCommunication from \nother bus nodesCommunication from \nrepaired nodes\nCommunication from \nother bus nodesCommunication from \nrepaired nodesCommunication from \nlocal nodeFigure 8-3. Example Timing Diagram for TXD DTO\nNote\nThe minimum dominant TXD time (t TXD_DTO ) allowed by the TXD DTO circuit limits the minimum\npossible transmitted data rate of the device. The CAN protocol allows a maximum of eleven\nsuccessive dominant bits (on TXD) for the worst case, where five successive dominant bits are\nfollowed immediately by an error frame. This, along with the t TXD_DTO  minimum, limits the minimum\ndata rate. Calculate the minimum transmitted data rate with Equation 1 .\nMinimum Data Rate = 11 / t TXD_DTO (1)\n8.3.3.2 Thermal Shutdown (TSD)\nIf the junction temperature of the device exceeds the thermal shutdown threshold (T TSD), the device turns off the\nCAN driver circuits, blocking the TXD-to-bus transmission path. The CAN bus terminals are biased to the\nrecessive level during a thermal shutdown, and the receiver-to-RXD path remains operational. The shutdown\ncondition is cleared when the junction temperature drops at least the thermal shutdown hysteresis temperature\n(TTSD_HYST ) below the thermal shutdown temperature (T TSD) of the device.\n8.3.3.3 Undervoltage Lockout and Default State\nThe supply pins have undervoltage detection that places the device in protected or default mode which protects\nthe bus during an undervoltage event on the V CC1 or V CC2 supply pins. If the bus-side power supply, V CC2, is\nless than about 4 V, the power shutdown circuits in the ISO1044B device disable the transceiver to prevent false\ntransmissions because of an unstable supply. If the V CC1 supply is still active when this occurs, the receiver\noutput (RXD) goes to a default HIGH (recessive) value. Table 8-1  summarizes the undervoltage lockout and fail-\nsafe behavior.\nTable 8-1.

The bus pins (CANH,\nCANL) have extremely low leakage currents when the device is unpowered to avoid loading down the bus which\nis critical if some nodes of the network are unpowered while the rest of the of network remains in operation.\n8.3.3.6 CAN Bus Short Circuit Current Limiting\nThe device has two protection features that limit the short circuit current when a CAN bus line has a short-circuit\nfault condition. The first protection feature is driver current limiting (both dominant and recessive states) and the\nsecond feature is TXD dominant state time out to prevent permanent higher short circuit current of the dominant\nstate during a system fault. During CAN communication the bus switches between dominant and recessive\nstates, therefore the short circuit current may be viewed either as the instantaneous current during each bus\nstate or as an average current of the two states. For system current (power supply) and power considerations in\nthe termination resistors and common-mode choke ratings, use the average short circuit current. Determine the\nratio of dominant and recessive bits by the data in the CAN frame plus the following factors of the protocol and\nPHY that force either recessive or dominant at certain times:\n• Control fields with set bits\n• Bit stuffing\n• Interframe space\n• TXD dominant time out (fault case limiting)\nThese factors ensure a minimum recessive amount of time on the bus even if the data field contains a high\npercentage of dominant bits. The short circuit current of the bus depends on the ratio of recessive to dominant\nbits and their respective short circuit currents. Use Equation 2  to calculate the average short circuit current.\nIOS(AVG)  = %Transmit × [(%REC_Bits × I OS(SS)_REC ) + (%DOM_Bits × I OS(SS)_DOM )] + [%Receive ×\nIOS(SS)_REC ](2)\nwhere\n• I OS(AVG)  is the average short circuit current\n• %Transmit is the percentage the node is transmitting CAN messages\n• %Receive is the percentage the node is receiving CAN messages\n• %REC_Bits is the percentage of recessive bits in the transmitted CAN messages\n• %DOM_Bits is the percentage of dominant bits in the transmitted CAN messages\n• I OS(SS)_REC  is the recessive steady state short circuit current\n• I OS(SS)_DOM  is the dominant steady state short circuit current\nNote\nConsider the short circuit current and possible fault cases of the network when sizing the power\nratings of the termination resistance and other network components.www.ti.comISO1044\nSLLSFB0A – MARCH 2020 – REVISED JULY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: ISO1044\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\nTable 8-2  and Table 8-3  list the driver and receiver functions.

A large number of nodes requires transceivers with high input impedance such as the ISO1044B\ntransceiver.\nMany CAN organizations and standards have scaled the use of CAN for applications outside the original ISO\n11898-2 Standard. These organizations and standards have made system-level trade-offs for data rate, cable\nlength, and parasitic loading of the bus. Examples of some of these specifications are ARINC825, CANopen,\nDeviceNet, and NMEA2000.\nThe ISO1044B device is specified to meet the 1.5-V requirement with a 50-Ω load, incorporating the worst case\nincluding parallel transceivers. The differential input resistance of the ISO1044B device is a minimum of 30 kΩ. If\n100 ISO1044B transceivers are in parallel on a bus, this requirement is equivalent to a 300-Ω differential load\nworst case. That transceiver load of 300 Ω in parallel with the 60 Ω gives an equivalent loading of 50 Ω.\nTherefore, the ISO1044B device theoretically supports up to 100 transceivers on a single bus segment.\nHowever, for CAN network design margin must be given for signal loss across the system and cabling, parasitic\nloadings, network imbalances, ground offsets and signal integrity, therefore a practical maximum number of\nnodes is typically much lower. Bus length may also be extended beyond the original ISO 11898 standard of 40 m\nby careful system design and data-rate tradeoffs. For example, CANopen network design guidelines allow the\nnetwork to be up to 1 km with changes in the termination resistance, cabling, less than 64 nodes, and a\nsignificantly lowered data rate.\nThis flexibility in CAN network design is one of the key strengths of the various extensions and additional\nstandards that have been built on the original ISO 11898-2 CAN standard. Using this flexibility requires the\nresponsibility of good network design and balancing these tradeoffs.\n9.2.2.2 CAN Termination\nThe ISO11898 standard specifies the interconnect to be a single twisted pair cable (shielded or unshielded) with\n120-Ω characteristic impedance (Z O). Resistors equal to the characteristic impedance of the line should be used\nto terminate both ends of the cable to prevent signal reflections. Unterminated drop-lines (stubs) connecting\nnodes to the bus should be kept as short as possible to minimize signal reflections. The termination may be in a\nnode, but if nodes are removed from the bus, the termination must be carefully placed so that it is not removed\nfrom the bus.\nNode 1\nCAN\nTransceiverMCU or DSP\nCAN\nControllerNode 2\nCAN\nTransceiverMCU or DSP\nCAN\nControllerNode 3\nCAN\nTransceiverMCU or DSP\nCAN\nControllerNode n\n(with termination)\nCAN\nTransceiverMCU or DSP\nCAN\nController\nRTERMRTERM\nFigure 9-2. Typical CAN Bus\nTermination may be a single 120-Ω resistor at the end of the bus, either on the cable or in a terminating node.

CAN Bus Termination Concepts\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\nTo make sure operation is reliable at all data rates and supply voltages, a 0.1-µF bypass capacitor is\nrecommended at the input and output supply pins (V CC1 and V CC2). The capacitors should be placed as close to\nthe supply pins as possible. In addition, a bulk capacitance, typically 4.7 μF, can be placed near the V CC2 supply\npin. If only a single primary-side power supply is available in an application, isolated power can be generated for\nthe secondary-side with the help of a transformer driver such as TI\'s SN6505B . For such applications, detailed\npower supply design, and transformer selection recommendations are available in the SN6505 Low-Noise 1-A\nTransformer Drivers for Isolated Power Supplies  data sheet .www.ti.comISO1044\nSLLSFB0A – MARCH 2020 – REVISED JULY 2020\nCopyright © 2020 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: ISO1044\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nA minimum of four layers is required to accomplish a low EMI PCB design (see Section 11.2  Figure 11-1). Layer\nstacking should be in the following order (top-to-bottom): high-speed signal layer, ground plane, power plane and\nlow-frequency signal layer.\n• Routing the high-speed traces on the top layer avoids the use of vias (and the introduction of their\ninductances) and allows for clean interconnects between the isolator and the transmitter and receiver circuits\nof the data link.\n• Placing a solid ground plane next to the high-speed signal layer establishes controlled impedance for\ntransmission line interconnects and provides an excellent low-inductance path for the return current flow.\n• Placing the power plane next to the ground plane creates additional high-frequency bypass capacitance of\napproximately 100 pF/in2.\n• Routing the slower speed control signals on the bottom layer allows for greater flexibility as these signal links\nusually have margin to tolerate discontinuities such as vias.\nSuggested placement and routing of ISO1044B bypass capacitors and optional TVS diodes is shown in Figure\n11-2. In particular, place the V CC2 bypass capacitors on the top layer, as close to the device pins as possible,\nand complete the connection to the V CC2 and G ND2 pins without using vias.\nIf an additional supply voltage plane or signal layer is needed, add a second power or ground plane system to\nthe stack to keep it symmetrical. This makes the stack mechanically stable and prevents it from warping. Also\nthe power and ground plane of each power system can be placed closer together, thus increasing the high-\nfrequency bypass capacitance significantly.\nFor detailed layout recommendations, refer to the Digital Isolator Design Guide .\n11.1.1 PCB Material\nFor digital circuit boards operating at less than 150 Mbps, (or rise and fall times greater than 1 ns), and trace\nlengths of up to 10 inches, use standard FR-4 UL94V-0 printed circuit board. This PCB is preferred over lower-\ncost alternatives because of lower dielectric losses at high frequencies, less moisture absorption, greater\nstrength and stiffness, and the self-extinguishing flammability-characteristics.\n11.2 Layout Example\n10 mils\n10 mils40 milsFR-4\n0r ~ 4.5Keep this space \nfree from planes,\ntraces, pads, and \nviasGround plane\nPower plane\nLow-speed tracesHigh-speed traces\nFigure 11-1.
